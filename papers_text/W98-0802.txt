Abstract 
This paper argues for the usefulness of multimodal spoken language corpora and 
specifies components of a platform for the creation, maintenance and exploitation 
of such corpora. Two of the components, which have already been implemented 
as prototypes, are described in more detail: TransTool and SyncTool. TransTool 
is a transcription editor meant o facilitate and partially automate the task of a hu- 
man transcriber, while SyncTool is a tool for aligning the resulting transcriptions 
with a digitized audio and video recording in order to allow synchronized pres- 
entation of different representations (e.g., text, audio, video, acoustic analysis). 
Finally, a brief comparison is made between these tools and other programs de- 
veloped for similar purposes. 
1. In t roduct ion  
The availability of adequate tools for the crea- 
tion, maintenance and use of multimodal spo- 
ken language corpora is an important instru- 
mental goal for spoken language research, 
whether this research is motivated primarily 
by the desire to gain a better understanding of 
the mechanisms of spoken communication r 
by the wish to develop practical applications 
such as multimodal interfaces for human- 
machine interaction. 
Multimodal dialog systems will be a fea- 
ture of many future applications, e.g., infor- 
mation systems. They will also be a feature of 
many VR systems and tutoring systems. The 
basic source of inspiration for dialog systems 
is ordinary human face-to-face communica- 
tion involving both speech and gestures. 
However, our understanding of human com- 
munication as a multimodal phenomenon is 
still very insufficient. Thus, there is a need 
for tools which will enable us to gain a better 
understanding of the relations between prop- 
erties of human face-to-face communication, 
such as gestures, intonation, words and 
11 
grammar, and of how the utterances and 
gestures of different speakers are coordinated 
with each other. 
In this paper, we report on a long-term 
project o develop a platform for multimodal 
spoken language corpora. More specifically, 
we describe two modules of such a platform, 
which both exist in prototype implementa- 
tions. The first of these modules, which is 
called TransTool, is a transcription editor 
which assists a human transcriber in produc- 
ing transcriptions in accordance with a given 
standard and partially automates some of the 
tasks involved, e.g., in the marking of over- 
lapping speech. 
The second one, SyncTool, is a tool for 
aligning transcriptions with the corresponding 
digitized audio and video recordings in order 
to allow synchronized isplay of different 
representations. Again, this is meant o pro- 
vide support for a human analyst rather than 
to provide a completely automated process, 
although the latter would of course be prefer- 
able in the long run. 
Before we turn to a detailed escription of 
TransTool and SyncTool, however, we will 
try to set the stage by presenting the platform 
for multimodal spoken language corpora of 
which these tools are meant o be part. 
2. Background 
Even though face-to-face spoken interaction 
is one of the most basic forms of human 
communication, many aspects of it are still 
not well understood. To some extent, this 
lack of knowledge is due to a lack of good 
data as well as adequate tools for presenting 
and analysing the data. In order to study spo- 
ken communication efficiently, we need not 
only recordings of naturally occurring spoken 
communication and transcriptions of these 
recordings, but also tools for presenting and 
analysing these transcriptions and recordings 
in a flexible and efficient manner. 
The picture is further complicated by the 
fact that face-to-face spoken communication 
is multimodal, involving gestures as well as 
speech, which means that video recordings 
are usually required. But this also means that 
transcriptions must be synchronized and dis- 
played together not only with an acoustic sig- 
nal but also in conjunction with visual data on 
gestures, etc., which tends to magnify the 
technical difficulties involved. 
Putting together a multimodal spoken lan- 
guage corpus is a very labor intensive task. 
First of all, manual transcription is laborious 
and time-consuming in itself, and even more 
so if the multimodal aspects of spoken com- 
munication are taken into consideration. To 
this we have to add the work needed to insure 
that transcriptions and recordings are properly 
aligned, so that they can be displayed and 
analysed in a synchronized fashion. 
In order to improve the situation, we need 
to develop adequate tools for the creation, 
maintenance and exploitation of multimodal 
spoken language corpora. Wherever possible, 
the aim should be to automate the processing, 
but for many of the tasks involved we will 
probably have to be content with providing 
computer support for manual work, support 
which either speeds up the process, or re- 
duces the error rate, or indeed both. 
The Department ofLinguistics at G6teborg 
University has been involved in the empirical 
study of face-to-face spoken communication 
since the late 1970s. This has resulted in a 
corpus of transcribed spoken Swedish, which 
contains a wide variety of different activity 
types and which currently contains about one 
million word tokens (cf. Allwood 1998). 
Over the years, a fairly detailed transcrip- 
tion standard has been developed, the most 
important features of which are the following 
(cf. Nivre 1998). 
? A transcription consists of a header, 
containing background information 
such as type of activity, participants, 
date of recording, duration, transcriber, 
etc., and a body, containing the tran- 
scription proper. 
? The transcription body consists of 
speech lhws, containing the transcribed 
speech of dialog participants (each line 
introduced by a speaker initial); com- 
ment lhws, containing comments per- 
taining to phenomena in speech lines 
(see below); section lhws, indicating 
boundaries between subactivities or
topics; and time lines, containing in- 
formation about he amount of time 
elapsed from the start of the activity. 
? Words are transcribed using standard 
orthography modified to capture spoken 
language variants and reductions (e.g., 
the Swedish first person pronoun 'jag' 
is transcribed 'ja' or 'jag' according to 
the actual pronunciation). 
? Spoken language variants are indexed 
for disambiguation to the level of stan- 
dard orthography (e.g., the Swedish 
first person pronoun is transcribed 'ja 1' 
to distinguish it from the affirmative 
particle 'ja0' \[yes\]). 
? Overlapping speech is marked by 
means of indexed square brackets 
(where the same index on different 
pairs of brackets indicate simultaneity). 
? Comments are made by enclosing the 
commented part of an utterance in
(possibly indexed) angle brackets and 
putting the actual comment in matching 
brackets on a separate comment line. 
An elaborate system of standardized 
comments, including comments for the 
coding of gestures, allows automatic 
parsing of comment information.

A short extract from a transcription, exempli- 
fying most of the features discussed above, 
can be found in Figure 1. 
Producing transcriptions in accordance 
with this standard is a very time-consuming 
task without adequate tools. It can also be an 
error-prone task, mostly because it involves a 
lot of numerical indexing (of words, com- 
ments, overlaps, etc.). This is the reason that 
we have thought it necessary to develop a 
computer tool to assist the manual transcriber 
in this process and partially automate some of 
the tasks involved (cf. section 3). 
However, although transcriptions of this 
kind constitute a useful form of data for the 
study of spoken language, they are neverthe- 
less insufficient in themselves and need to be 
supplemented with the actual sound and video 
recordings. Moreover, transcriptions and re- 
cordings need to be aligned so that analysts 
can view them together and do various types 
of coding and analysis based both on the re- 
cording and the transcription. 
In order to satisfy these needs, we believe 
that several tools are needed. Hence, we have 
embarked on the project of building a plat- 
form for multimodal spoken language cor- 
pora, consisting of a set of integrated tools 
for the creation, maintenance and use of such 
corpora. The planned tools of the platform are 
the following: 
? A tool for digitizing audiovisual corpus 
data (recordings). 
? A tool for producing and checking 
standardized transcriptions 
(TransTool). 
? A tool for semi-automatic alignment of 
audio/video and transcribed text 
(SyncTool). 
? A multimodal corpus presentation tool, 
allowing simultaneous and synchro- 
nized display of transcriptions and 
audio/video recordings. 
? A transcription coding tool, including 
display of transcriptions in different 
formats, with optional use of synchro- 
nized audio/video display. 
? An analysis tool for processing infor- 
mation from the coding tool (and from 
the corpus itself). 
If possible, all tools should be implemented 
in a platform-independent way and preferably 
allow access via the Internet. 
Before we go on to describe the two tools 
relating directly to transcription - - TransTool 
and SyncTool - -  it might be worth address- 
ing the question of why we have chosen to 
develop our own tools instead of using ex- 
isting ones. The simple answer is that we 
have not so far been able to find any tools that 
provide the right kind of functionality in the 
right kind of environment. First of all, there 
is no abundance of software in this domain. 
Secondly, many of the programs that do exist 
are developed for a specific purpose or a spe- 
cific standard, which makes them hard to use 
in other contexts. Finally, most of the pro- 
grams are available only on one or two soft- 
ware platforms, which may or may not be a 
problem depending on whether this happens 
to coincide with the platforms that you are 
working with yourself. 
However, although we have not so far 
been able to reuse existing tools, it is clearly 
important to be open to developments within 
the area. In section 5, we will therefore make 
some brief comparisons between our tools 
and similar programs developed by others. 
Hopefully, this can contribute to a better un- 
derstanding of the similarities and differences 
between different approaches and pave the 
way for cooperation i the future.

3. TransTool  
TransTool is a computer tool for transcribing 
spoken language in accordance with the stan- 
dard developed within the research program 
Semantics and Spoken Language at G/Steborg 
University, Department of Linguistics, and 
described in Nivre (1998) (cf. section 2). 
The current implementation f TransTool 
is done in Tcl/Tk (Tool Command Language/ 
Toolkit) and runs (at least) in Unix, Macin- 
tosh and Windows environments. The latest 
version of the program can be downloaded 
from http://www.ling.gu.se/gmslc/. 
TransTool is equipped with File-, Edit- 
and Format menus which operate in much the 
same way as in word processing programs 
(Figure 2). 
In addition, TransTool contains three special 
menus for the transcription of spoken lan- 
guage: the Add menu, the Comment menu, 
and the Tools menu. 
The Add menu (Figure 3) contains com- 
mands for starting a new utterance (New ut- 
terance), for inserting time codes (Time code) 
and section boundaries (Section), and for 
marking inaudible speech (Inaudible speech). 
All of these commands help speed up the 
transcription process while at the same time 
minimizing the risk for typing errors and en- 
suring conformance with the transcription 
standard. 
Figure 3. The Add menu 
Figure 2, The File, Edit and Format menus 
The Add menu also contains a command for 
marking overlapping speech (Overlap), which 
automatically inserts and keeps track of the 
numerical indices used to indicate which por- 
tions of speech overlap with each other (cf. 
Figure 1). 
The final command in the Add menu is the 
command for adding a header to the tran- 
scription (Header). This command invokes a 
set of standardized forms, where the user has 
to fill in all the relevant information about the 
recorded activity, such as time and place of 
recording, type of activity, participants, tran- 
scriber, etc. involved in this particular con- 
versation and appnopdate initials for them, 
transcriber, etc. The forms used to compose 
the header can be seen in Figures 4 and 5, 
while the resulting header can be seen in Fig- 
ure 6. 
The second special menu is the Comments 
menu (Figure 7), where the user can select 
the whole range of standardized comments 
provided by the transcription standard. The 
comments are displayed in sub-menus, orted 
14 
by category, which may be ripped off and 
placed as separate windows on the screen. 
When using this menu, the user first selects 
the portion of speech that he wants to make a 
comment about, and then selects the appro- 
priate type of comment from one of the sub- 
menus. The comments are automatically in- 
dexed. 
The final menu of interest is the Tools 
menu (Figure 8), which mainly contains 
commands for indexing. In addition to the 
indexing of comments and overlap (see 
above), which may need to be updated, the 
transcription also requires ambiguous spoken 
language variants (such as the pronunciation 
'ja' of the Swedish first person pronoun 
'jag') to be disambiguated by numerical indi- 
ces. This is done through the command MSO 
indices (where MSO stands for Modified 
Standard Orthography), which automatically 
identifies all word forms that need to be in- 
dexed and prompts the user for disambigua- 
tion.

4. SyncToo l  
SyncTool is an application developed for 
synchronizing transcriptions with digitized 
audio/video recordings. SyncTool is meant o 
be a synchronizing and viewing tool, allow- 
ing the researcher to set time codes in appro- 
priate places in the transcriptions, and to view 
the transcription and play the recording with- 
out having to manually locate the specific 
passage in the recording. 
SyncTool is still in early development, 
with a limited but working prototype, down- 
loadable from http://www.ling.gu.se/gmslc/. 
Development is done with cross platform 
compatibility in mind targeting the Macintosh, 
Windows and Unix platforms. The prototype 
has been implemented using a combination of 
AppleScript and Tcl/Tk on the Macintosh 
platform; we are currently moving to pure 
Tcl/Tk and have started a re-implementation 
in Java. 
SyncTool presupposes the following data: 
? A transcription conforming to the tran- 
scription standard (cf. section 2). 
? A media file of some kind, containing 
the corresponding audio and/or video 
recording in digitized form. 
The user interface is quite straightforward. 
The user is presented with three windows 
(Figure 9): 
? The Transcript Score & Time Line 
Window presents the transcription i
musical score format along with a time 
line extracted from the media and media 
control buttons (bottom window in 
Figure 9). 
? The Media Window (currently an exter- 
nal tool) displays the audio/video re- 
cording, allowing the user to swiftly 
move back and forth in the recording 
(top right window in Figure 9). 
? The Full Transcript Window displays 
the transcription i original format. 
All of these windows, except he Full Tran- 
script Window are available in the prototype 
we have running. In the final version, while 
playing an audio or video sequence, the tran- 
scription will be scrolled and a visual cue will 
be shown to indicate which part of the tran- 
scription is currently on display. Media con- 
trois, such as Play, Stop, etc. will be avail- 
able, as well as controls for setting the vol- 
ume, playback speed, stepping back and forth 
in the recording and looping sequences. 
The Speaker Pane inside the Transcript 
Score & Time Line Window is where the 
transcription is presented to the user in the 
special score format used by SyncTool 
(Figure 10). The score format is a convenient 
way of displaying an ongoing dialog involv- 
ing several speakers. 
Each speaker is assigned a 'channel' or 
track, and the utterances that s/he produces 
are segmented by means of transcription 
points. Transcription points correspond to 
speaker changes and the start and end of 
overlaps. The transcription points used to 
segement the utterances in the Speaker Pane 
are derived automatically from the underlying 
transcription. When a transcription is dis- 
played in musical score format, transcription 
points span all the speaker channels in the 
Speaker Pane and are numbered, as can be 
seen in Figure 11. 
The Time Line Pane inside the Transcript 
Score & Timeline Window allows the user to 
specify where in the timeline of the recording 
each of the transcription points occur. Time is 
measured in minutes, seconds and frames for 
video with audio, and minutes, seconds and 
milliseconds for audio only recordings. 
A slider for each transcription point sets its 
time in the recording (as shown by the label 
beneath it), and can be moved back and forth 
through the timeline. Transcription point slid- 
ers cannot go outside their boundaries, e.g., 
it is not possible for transcription point 2 to 
move to the left of transcription point 1, or to 
the right of transcription point 3, and so on. 
In Figure 13 the correspondence b tween 
the transcription points in the Speaker Pane 
and in the Timeline Pane is highlighted with 
arrows. 
Initial placement of sliders is very roughly 
calculated with a simple algorithm, which 
distributes the sliders along the timeline more 
or less according to the length of the utter- 
ance. Note that we are not doing any kind of 
sound signal analysis; the algorithm is based 
on length of the text appearing in the tran- 
script. The result is, as could be expected, not 
very good, but it helps somewhat and saves 
some time; we are working on improving the

Figure 14. Go to transcription point 
algorithm, possibly using words per second 
measures and/or involving simple sound sig-

To go to a specific transcription point, the 
user enters it in the 'Go to transcription point' 
edit field (Figure 14). Both the Speaker Pane 
and the Timeline Pane then scroll to the tran- 
scription point in question. 
Double clicking on a slider plays the re- 
cording from that ranscription point. To stop 
playback, the user presses the space key on 
the keyboard. The prototype also implements 
primitive playback controls, currently only 
Start and Stop. These will be enhanced in up- 
coming versxons. 
The Media Window is currently imple- 
mented as an external application, The Media 
Viewer. It has no user interface apart from the 
media controllers, and its only purpose is to 
allow other applications to communicate with 
it and programmatically tell it to open media 
files, start/stop layback, provide data on the 
movie, etc. It uses QuickTime and all the me- 
dia formats that QuickTime supports (i.e. 
MPEG, QuickTime movies, AIFF, WAV, 
etc.), and it provides full motion playback of 
19 
MPEG-1 movies with appropriate computer 
hardware. 
The Media Viewer is available as a sepa- 
rate Macintosh application. Note however that 
we are in the process of implementing the 
functionality of The Media Viewer into Sync- 
Tool as plug-in module, which we hope will 
give us better control of how media files are 
used in SyncTool. 
Planned, but currently missing features in- 
clude the possibility to visualize sound waves 
along the Time Line Pane, which will let us- 
ers more easily position the transcription 
point sliders. We are also considering the in- 
clusion of spectrograms, etc. Furthermore, 
we need to implement the real-time visual cue 
indicating which part of the transcription is 
being played back. This will be much easier 
to achieve when the Media Viewer function- 
ality is built into SyncTool. Another feature 
that is going to be implemented is the possi- 
bility to add and delete transcription points, as 
well as separate tracks for different kinds of 
synchronisations (gestures, etc). 
In its current state, SyncTool is not onlty a 
synchronising tool, it is also a viewer of syn- 
chronized transcriptions. The tool presents 
audio, video and text simultaneously. The 
user can select parts of the transcription text 
and have the corresponding audio or video 
sequence played back with a minimum of ef- 
fort. With this use in mind, the possibility to 
correct errors found in the transcription, such 
as incorrectly marked overlaps, will be a very 
useful feature too. The prototype has already 
shown its usefulness in this area, highlighting 
the usability of the score format. These errors 
are quite hard to discover using the traditional 
full view of a transcription. Therefore, it is 
possible that TransTool and SyncTool will be 
merged in the future. Ultimately, our goal is 
to provide a set of integrated tools for tran- 
scription, synchronization/alignment, coding, 
annotation and presentation. 
5. Some Compar i sons  
In this section, we will compare our tools to 
some other programs that help align text and 
recordings. The tools considered are: 
? SoundWalker (by Jack Du Bois) 
\[http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/depts/ 
linguistics/research/csae/soundwalker/ 
walk.html\] 
? SoundWriter (by Jack Du Bois) 
\[http://humanitas.ucsb.eduldepts/ 
linguistics/lab/transcriptions.html\] 
? SyncWriter (by med-i-bit) 
\[http://www.med.i.bit/Software/ 
syncWRITER/info.english.html\] 
SoundWalker/VoiceWalker/MediaWalker 
lets you view recordings in 'auto-pilot' mode; 
we quote from the on-line manual: 'The most 
distinctive feature in SoundWalker for con- 
trolling the playback of recorded speech is 
called the Walk. The Walk function plays the 
recording in manageable chunks so that the 
transcriber can concentrate on transcribing, as 
it automatically Walks through the recording 
one Step at a time. It plays a brief sound bite 
consisting of the first four seconds of the re- 
cording (one Step), and repeats this portion 
of sound several times to allow the user to 
transcribe it. Then it steps forward slightly, 
beginning the second Step about one second 
after the first. It plays this new four-second 
chunk of sound several times, and then 
moves on to the third Step. Because ach new 
Step overlaps partially with the previous one, 
the transcriber always has enough familiar 
context o know where s/he is in the record- 
ing. And because the Walk is entirely auto- 
matic, it leaves the user's hands free to tran- 
scribe using his/her preferred word processor 
in a separate window.' The user interface of 
SoundWalker is depicted in Figure 16.

Compared to our tools, SoundWalker pro- 
vides a subset of the functionality that we 
plan to provide in SyncTool, albeit in a more 
refined and elegant way, which we have not 
achieved yet. The main focus of Sound- 
Walker is to support he manual transcription 
process and as such that functionality should 
be provided in Transtool. 
As was mentioned above, we are already 
planning to integrate TransTool and SyncTool 
The development of The Media Viewer into a 
plug-in module for inclusion in Transtool is 
one step towards that goal. SoundWalker 
uses Word as its text processor, something 
that we cannot do. When transcribing spoken 
language we use our own Modified Standard 
Orthography (MSO), which lets us transcribe 
speech as it is actually pronounced. MSO 
then uses an indexing system to map between 
Standard Orthography and MSO. This in- 
dexing feature, along with automated overlap 
handling, is managed by TransTool. 
Turning from SoundWalker to Sound- 
Writer, we first note that: 'SoundWriter in- 
corporates the features of SoundWalker 1.1 
as well as the ability to align transcripts with 
sound files. Basically, this program assigns 
starting and ending SMPTE time codes to 
each intonation unit.' (From download page.) 
SoundWriter provides more or less the ba- 
sic functionality we want to have in SyncTool 
and in addition allows the user to partially edit 
the transcription. The alignment tool of 
SoundWriter is very nice, and we do not have 
anything like it in SyncTool or The Media 
Viewer today. Something that is particularly 
helpful is the 'guessing' function in Sound- 
Writer. Even if it is not a guessing function 
per se (you specify the number of words per 
second, and then it 'guesses' where the next 
turn is) it clearly speeds up the alignment of 
transcription and recording.

There are also differences, however. :\['he 
most important one is in the transcription 
standard used. From the information that ,=an 
be gathered from the web site, it seems daat 
this standard only covers a small subset of the 
phenomena taken into account by our stan- 
dard. Another difference is the musical score 
format used in SyncTool but not in Sound- 
Writer. Moreover, SoundWfiter does not 
support the use of video recordings in the 
same way as SyncTool does. Finally, 
SoundWriter is not platform independent but 
only exists for Windows computers. 
The third program, SyncWriter, handles 
texts with simultaneous passages (tracks or 
channels) and works with the notion of a mu- 
sical score format in a way similar to Sync- 
Tool. Figure 18 shows a screenshot of the 
SyncWriter user interface layout. 
SyncWfiter does what we need to do; it 
synchronizes text with a QuickTime movie. 
There is a Tape window (the topmost win- 
dow in Figure 18) that contains all the text 
tracks, the movie track(s) and whatever extra 
tracks one deems necessary. It is possible to 
attach a movie to the movie track. A thumb- 
nail of the movie is then displayed in the 
track.

One of the drawbacks with SyncWriter is 
that you have to synchronize all of the tracks 
separately, as there is no hierarchy of tracks 
or of synctabs. This can be very time- 
consuming if you have a lot of speakers. 
Moreover, there is no time line, you attach a 
movie to a movie track. And the system with 
movie thumbnails i not very elegant. 
So, even if SyncWriter contains ome of 
the features that we want TransTool and 
SyncTool to have, it is not quite adequate for 
our needs. Finally, it is again platform spe- 
cific (Macintosh).

6. Conc lus ion  
In this paper, we have argued for the useful- 
ness of an integrated platform for multimodal 
spoken language corpora, and we have pre- 
sented two simple tools that have been devel- 
oped as components of such a framework. 
Although these tools are still far from consti- 
tuting a full-fledged platform for multimodal 
spoken language corpora, with synchronized 
display of transcriptions and audio/video re- 
cordings, as well as tools for annotation and 
presentation, they nevertheless represent the 
first steps towards such a platform and have 
already proven useful in their own right. We 
also believe that the experience gained from 
the development of these tools will be valu- 
able in future work towards a more ambitious 
and useful toolbox.
