Abstract 
This paper describes our system 
participating in task 18 of SemEval-2010, 
i.e. disambiguating Sentiment-
Ambiguous Adjectives (SAAs). To 
disambiguating SAAs, we compare the 
machine learning-based and lexicon-
based methods in our submissions: 1) 
Maximum entropy is used to train  
classifiers based on the annotated 
Chinese data from the NTCIR opinion 
analysis tasks, and the clause-level and 
sentence-level classifiers are compared; 
2) For the lexicon-based method, we first 
classify the adjectives into two classes: 
intensifiers (i.e. adjectives intensifying 
the intensity of context) and suppressors 
(i.e. adjectives decreasing the intensity of 
context), and then use the polarity of 
context to get the SAAs? contextual 
polarity based on a sentiment lexicon. 
The results show that the performance of 
maximum entropy is not quite high due 
to little training data; on the other hand, 
the lexicon-based method could improve 
the precision by considering the polarity 
of context. 
1 Introduction 
In recent years, sentiment analysis, which mines 
opinions from information sources such as news, 
blogs, and product reviews, has drawn much 
attention in the NLP field (Hatzivassiloglou and 
McKeown, 1997; Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 
2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2008). It 
has many applications such as social media 
monitoring, market research, and public 
relations.  
Some adjectives are neutral in sentiment 
polarity out of context, but they could show 
positive, neutral or negative meaning within 
specific context. Such words can be called 
dynamic sentiment-ambiguous adjectives 
(SAAs). However, SAAs have not been 
intentionally tackled in the researches of 
sentiment analysis, and usually have been 
discarded or ignored by most previous work. Wu 
et al, (2008) presents an approach of combining 
collocation information and SVM to 
disambiguate SAAs, in which the collocation-
based method was first used to disambiguate 
adjectives within the context of collocation (i.e. a 
sub-sentence marked by comma), and then the 
SVM algorithm was explored for those instances 
not covered by the collocation-based method. 
According to their experiments, their supervised 
algorithm achieves encouraging performance. 
The task 18 at SemEval-2010 is intended to 
create a benchmark dataset for disambiguating 
SAAs. Given only 100 trial sentences, but not 
provided with any official training data, 
participants are required to tackle this problem 
data by unsupervised approaches or use their 
own training data. The task consists of 14 SAAs, 
which are all high-frequency words in Mandarin 
Chinese. They are ?|big, ?|small, ?|many, ?
|few, ?|high, ?|low, ?|thick, ?|thin, ?|deep, 
?|shallow, ?|heavy, ?|light, ??|huge, ??
|grave. This task deals with Chinese SAAs, but 
the disambiguating techniques should be 
language-independent. Please refer to (Wu and 
Jin, 2010) for more descriptions of the task. 
In our participating system, the annotated 
Chinese data from the NTCIR opinion analysis 
tasks is used as training data with the help of a 
combined sentiment lexicon. A machine 
learning-based method (namely maximum 
entropy) and the lexicon-based method are 
compared in our submissions. The results show 
that the performance of maximum entropy is not 
quite high due to little training data; on the other 
hand, the lexicon-based method could improve 
292
the precision by considering the context of 
SAAs. In Section 2, we briefly describe data 
preparation of sentiment lexicon and training 
data. Our approaches for disambiguating SAAs 
are given in Section 3. The experiment and 
results are presented in Section 4, followed by a 
conclusion in Section 5. 
2 Data Preparation 
2.1 Sentiment Lexicon 
Several traditional Chinese resources of polar 
words/phrases are collected, including NTU 
Sentiment Dictionary1, The Lexicon of Chinese 
Positive Words (Shi and Zhu, 2006), The Lexicon 
of Chinese Negative Words (Yang and Zhu, 2006) 
0, and CityU?s sentiment-bearing word/phrase 
list (Lu et al 2008), which were manually 
marked in the political news data by trained 
annotators (Benjamin and Lu, 2008). Sentiment-
bearing items marked with the SENTIMENT_KW 
tag (SKPI), including only positive and negative 
items but not neutral ones, were also 
automatically extracted from the Chinese sample 
data of NTCIR-6 OAPT (Seki et al, 2007). All 
these polar item lexicons were combined, and the 
combined polar item lexicon consists of 13,437 
positive items and 18,365 negative items, a total 
of 31,802 items.  
2.2 Training Data 
The training data is extracted from the Chinese 
sample and test data from the NTCIR opinion 
analysis task, including NTCIR-6 (Seki et al, 
2007), NTCIR-7 (Seki et al, 2008) and NTCIR-8 
(Seki et al, 2010). The NTCIR opinion analysis 
tasks provide an opportunity to evaluate the 
techniques used by different participants based 
on a common evaluation framework in Chinese 
(simplified and traditional), Japanese and 
English.  
For data from NTCIR-6 and NTCIR-7, three 
annotators manually marked the polarity of each 
opinionated sentence, and the lenient polarity is 
used here as the gold standard (please refer to 
Seki et al, 2008 for explanation of lenient and 
strict standard). For each opinionated sentence 
from NTCIR-8, only two annotators marked and 
the strict polarity is used as the gold standard. 
The traditional Chinese sentences are transferred 
into simplified Chinese. In total, there are about 
12K opinionated sentences annotated with 
polarity, out of which about 9K are marked as 
                                                          
1 http://nlg18.csie.ntu.edu.tw:8080/opinion/index.html  
positive or negative, and others neutral. All the 
9K sentences plus the 100 sentences from the 
trial data are used as the sentence-level training 
data. 
Meanwhile, we also try to get the clause-level 
training data since the context of collocation 
within sub-sentences are quite crucial for 
disambiguating SAAs according to Wu et al 
(2008). From the 9K positive/ negative sentences 
above, we automatically extract the clause for 
each occurrence of SAAs.  
Note the polarity for a whole sentence is not 
necessarily the same with that of the clause 
containing SAAs. Consider the sentence ? ?? 
? ?? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?? 
(In the current large circumstance of the world, 
China and Russia support each other). The 
polarity of the whole sentence is positive, while 
the clause ??????????(In the current 
large circumstance of the world) containing a 
SAA ? (large) is neutral, and the polarity lies in 
the second part of the whole sentence, i.e. ?? 
?? (support each other). 
Thus, we manually checked the polarity of 
clauses containing SAAs. Due to time limitation, 
we only checked 465 clauses. Plus the clauses 
extracted from 100 trial sentences, the final 
clause-level training data consist of 565 
positive/negative clauses containing SAAs. 
3 Our Approach for Disambiguating 
SAAs 
To disambiguating SAAs, we use the maximum 
entropy algorithm and the sentiment lexicon-
based method, and also combine them together. 
3.1 The Maximum Entropy-based Method 
Maximum entropy classification (MaxEnt) is a 
technique which has proven effective in a 
number of natural language processing 
applications (Berger et al, 1996). Le Zhang?s 
maximum entropy tool2 is used for classification. 
The Chinese sentences are segmented into 
words using a production segmentation system. 
Unigrams of words are used as basic features for 
classification. Bigrams are also tried, but does 
not show improvement, and thus are not 
described in details here. 
3.2 The Lexicon-based Method 
For the lexicon-based method, we first classify 
the 14 adjectives into two classes: intensifiers

293
and suppressors. Intensifiers refer to adjectives 
intensifying the intensity of context, including ?
|big, ? |many, ? |high, ? |thick, ? |deep, ?
|heavy, ??|huge, ??|grave, while suppressors 
refer to adjectives decreasing the intensity of 
context, including ?|small, ?|few, ?|low, ?
|thin, ?|shallow, ?|light. 
Meanwhile, the collocation nouns are also 
classified into two classes: positive and negative. 
Positive nouns include ? ? |quality, ? ?
|standard, ? ? |level, ? ? |benefit, ? ?
|achievement, etc. Negative nouns include ??
|pressure, ?? |disparity, ?? |problem, ??
|risk, ??|pollution etc.  
The hypothesis here is that intensifiers will 
receive the polarity of their collocations while 
suppressors will get the opposite polarity of their 
collocations. For example, ?? |achievement 
could be collocated with one of the following 
intensifiers: ?|big, ?|many or ?|high, and the 
adjectives just receive the polarity of ??
|achievement, which is positive. Meanwhile, ?
?|pollution could be collocated with one of the 
following suppressors: ?|small, ?|few, ?|low, 
and the adjectives just receive the opposite 
polarity of??|pollution, which is also positive. 
 Based on this hypothesis, we could get the 
polarity of SAAs through theirs collocation 
nouns within the clauses containing SAAs. The 
context of SAAs is a sub-sentence marked by 
comma. The sentiment lexicon mentioned in 
Section 2.1 is used to find polarity of collocation 
nouns. 
3.3 Combining Maximum Entropy and 
Lexicon  
To combine the two methods above, the lexicon-
based method is first used to disambiguate the 
sentiment of SAAs, and the context of 
collocation is a sub-sentence marked by comma. 
Then for those instances that are not covered by 
the lexicon-based method, the maximum entropy 
algorithm is explored. 
4 Experiment and Results 
The dataset contains two parts: some sentences 
were extracted from Chinese Gigaword (LDC 
corpus: LDC2005T14), and other sentences were 
gathered through the search engine like Google. 
Firstly, these sentences were automatically 
segmented and POS-tagged, and then the 
ambiguous adjectives were manually annotated 
with the correct sentiment polarity within the 
sentence context. Two annotators annotated the 
sentences double blindly, and the third annotator 
checks the annotation. All the data of 2,917 
sentences is provided as the test set, and 
evaluation is performed in terms of micro 
accuracy and macro accuracy.  
We submitted 4 runs: run 1 is based on the 
sentence-level MaxEnt classifier; run 2 on the 
clause-level MaxEnt classifier; run 3 is got by 
combining the lexicon-based method and the 
sentence-level MaxEnt classifier; and run 4 by 
combining the lexicon-based method and the 
clause-level MaxEnt classifier. The official 
scores for the 4 runs are shown in Table 2. 
Table 2. Results of 4 Runs 
Run Micro Acc. (%) Macro Acc. (%)
1 61.98 67.89 
2 62.63 60.85 
3 71.55 75.54 
4 72.47 69.80 
From Table 2, we can observe that: 
1) Compared the highest scores achieved by 
other teams, the performance of maximum 
entropy (run 1 and 2) is not quite high due to 
little training data;  
2) By integrating the lexicon-based method 
and maximum entropy (run 3 and 4), we improve 
the accuracy by considering the context of SAAs;  
3) The sentence-level maximum entropy 
classifier shows better macro accuracy, and 
clause-level one better micro accuracy. 
In addition to the official scores, we also 
evaluate the performance of the lexicon-based 
method alone. The micro and macro accuracy are 
respectively 0.847 and 0.835665, showing that 
the lexicon-based method is more accurate than 
the maximum entropy algorithm (run 1 and 2). 
But it only covers 1,436 (49%) of 2,917 test 
instances.  
Because the data from the NTCIR opinion 
analysis task is not specifically annotated for this 
task, and the manually checked clauses are less 
than 600, the performance of our system is not 
quite high compared to the highest performance 
achieved by other teams. 
5 Conclusion 
To disambiguating SAAs, we compare machine 
learning-based and lexicon-based methods in our 
submissions: 1) Maximum entropy is used to 
train classifiers based on the annotated Chinese 
data from the NTCIR opinion analysis tasks, and  
the clause-level and sentence-level classifiers are 
294
compared; 2) For the lexicon-based method, we 
first classify the adjectives into two classes: 
intensifiers (i.e. adjectives intensifying the 
intensity of context) and suppressors (i.e. 
adjectives decreasing the intensity of context), 
and then use the polarity of context to get the 
SAAs? contextual polarity. The results show that 
the performance of maximum entropy is not 
quite high due to little training data; on the other 
hand, the lexicon-based method could improve 
the precision by considering the context of 
SAAs.
