The concept  o f  theme and rheme we want  to  propose  in  
th i s  paper  i s  p ragmat ic  in  two senses  o f  the  wordz the  theme/  
theme s t ructure  (TRS) i s  v iewed as  a s t ra tegy  o f  communicat ion  
and thus  be longs  to  pra~nat ics ,  and i t  seems to  o f fe r  a prag-  
mat ic  so lu t ion  fo r  a prob lem o f  mach ine  t rans la t ion .  
The s tar t ing -po in t  o f  our  cons iderat ions  i s  de f ined  by 
severa l  a rEuments  c la iming  the  ne@ess i ty  to  preserve  the  TRS 
o f  sentences  (o r  u t te rances)  in  the  process  o f  t rans la t ion ,  
as  s ta ted  in  Koen i tz ,  1978z 
- the  exhaust ive - l i s t ing  read ing  o f  the  theme 
- the  presuppos i t ions l  character  o f  the  theme 
- the  connex ion  o f  the  THS w i th  the  degree  o f  textua l  coherence  
. the  cor re la t ion  o f  themeness  and def in i teness  
- general considerations in a framework of communication 
theory  ( readab i l i ty  o f  texts  e to . )  
Fur ther  a rguments  might  eas i ly  be added to  th i s  l i s t  
(e .g .  the  re la t ion  between the  TR3 and the  scope  o f  operators ) .  
In  p r inc ip le  a l l  o f  them ho ld  fo r  mach ine  t rans la t ion  as  we l l ,  
a t  leas t  i f  i t  i s  pursued w i th in  a theoret i ca l  f remework ,  as  
e .g .  in  the  case  o f  the  pro jec t  SALAT (o f .  Hauensoh i ld ,  1978) 
and o f  the  successor  p ro jec t  "Ubersetzungsbezogene Kontext -  
theor ie"  (Context  theory  fo r  t rans la t ion)  in  the  sp i r i t  o f  
wh ich  th i s  paper  was wr i t ten .

These cons iderat ions  lead  to  the  quest ion  whether  i t  i s  
necessary  to  compute the  TRS o f  ever7  t rans la ted  sentence ,  
wh ich  would be very  d i f f i cu l t  - i f  a t  a l l  poss ib le  - E iven  
the  h igh  degree  of  ambigu i ty  o f  wr i t ten  texts  w i th  respect  to  
the  TRS. 
We want to  propose  a somewhat s impl i f ied  procedure  
wh ich  never the less  ensures  the  preservat ion  o f  the  T I~.  
Theoret i ca l ly ,  th i s  p rocedure  i s  based  on  a concept  o f  theme 
and theme that  ascr ibes  them a s t ra teg ic  ro le  in  communicat -  
ion ,  cont ro l l ing ,  as  i t  were ,  severa l  o ther  fac tors  ( semant ic  
and syntact i c ) .  I f  these  la t te r  fac tors  a re  kept  constant  
dur ing  the  t ra~s la t ion  process ,  we can  be sure  that  we have  
preserved  theme and theme as  we l l  (o r  that  the  boundary  i s  
i r re levant  in  the  g iven  sentence) ,  
The cent ra l  hypothes is  o f  th i s  paper  i s  the  fo l low ing :  
in  most  cases  i t  i s  su f f i c ient  to  preserve  the  under ly ing  
(communicat ive ly  cond i t ioned)  o rder  o f  ma in  e lements ,  wh ich  
is conce ived  in  a wa~ ve~J  similar to  that  o f  Sgall and Ha- 
JiSov~, 1977/78, or  Ha~l~ov~,  1980, but  w i thout  ind i@at ion  o f  
an  exact  boundaz7  between theme and theme.  ~he va l id i ty  o f  
th i s  hypothes is  is, of  course ,  l im i ted  to  cer ta in  languages  
(we t reat  German, F rench  and Russ ian)  and to  cer ta in  types  of  
texts ,  a iminE  exc lus ive ly  a t  an  opt ima l  t ransmiss ion  o f  in fo rm-  
a t ion .  Wi th  such  a l im i ta~ion ,  i t  i s  very  o f ten  poss ib le  to  
der ive  the  under ly ing  order  in  a s t ra ight fo rward  way f rom the  
sur face  order  o f  the  main  const i tuents  o f  a sentence .  
I t  might  seem surpr i s ing  that  th i s  shou ld  ho ld  fo r  such  
languages  as  German,  F rench  and Russ ian ,  ~h ich  are  normal ly  
v iewed as  ez J~ ib i t ing  d i f fe rent  types  o f  word-order  reEu lar i t -  
l ea .  But  i f  we look  a t  texts  o f  the  ment ioned ~ ind  (e .g .  
repor ts  fo r  in ternat iona l  o rgan izat ions) ,  w@ f ind  that  in  a l l  
th ree  languages  they  axe organ ized  in  a similar way, obey ing  
more or  less  to  some k ind  of  " l inear i ty  p r inc ip le"s  sentences  
- 122 - 
normal ly  s ta r t  wi th the e lements  connect ing  them to the prec -  
ed ing context ,  the e lements car ry ing  "new in fo rmat ion"  are  
s i tuated  at  the end. Such organ izat ion  seem- to be most 
e f fec t ive  in  the sense of  an opt imal  t rans fer  o f  in fo rmat ion .  
Thus we propose a procedure that  der ives  the under ly in~ 
from the sur face  order  o f  the main const i tuents  us ing  some 
t rans format ions  fo r  spec ia l  oases  (e .g .  c le f t - sentences) .  
The synthes is  w i l l  y ie ld  the cor respond ing  sur face  order  of  
the  ta rget  language,  aga in  wi th  a minimal se t  of t rans forn~t -  
ionse 
The procedure i s  to be cont ro l led  by severa l  semantic 
fac tors  that  are c lose ly  re la ted  to  the TRS (compare the 
ar&~msnts fo r  the preservat ion  of  the TR3 in  t rans la t ion  
mentioned at  the beg inn ing) ,  but have to be kept constant  on 
independent grounds 
- anaphoric relations 
- de f in i te  or indef in i te  (or  gener ic )  in terpreta t ion  of  noun- 
-phrases 
- scope of  quantiflsrs, negat ion  and o ther  operators
