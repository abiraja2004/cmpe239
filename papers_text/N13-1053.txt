Abstract
The rising influence of user-generated online
reviews (Cone, 2011) has led to growing in-
centive for businesses to solicit and manufac-
ture DECEPTIVE OPINION SPAM?fictitious
reviews that have been deliberately written to
sound authentic and deceive the reader. Re-
cently, Ott et al (2011) have introduced an
opinion spam dataset containing gold standard
deceptive positive hotel reviews. However, the
complementary problem of negative deceptive
opinion spam, intended to slander competitive
offerings, remains largely unstudied. Follow-
ing an approach similar to Ott et al (2011), in
this work we create and study the first dataset
of deceptive opinion spam with negative sen-
timent reviews. Based on this dataset, we find
that standard n-gram text categorization tech-
niques can detect negative deceptive opinion
spam with performance far surpassing that of
human judges. Finally, in conjunction with
the aforementioned positive review dataset,
we consider the possible interactions between
sentiment and deception, and present initial
results that encourage further exploration of
this relationship.
1 Introduction
Consumer?s purchase decisions are increasingly in-
fluenced by user-generated online reviews of prod-
ucts and services (Cone, 2011). Accordingly,
there is a growing incentive for businesses to so-
licit and manufacture DECEPTIVE OPINION SPAM?
fictitious reviews that have been deliberately writ-
ten to sound authentic and deceive the reader (Ott et
al., 2011). For example, Ott et al (2012) has esti-
mated that between 1% and 6% of positive hotel re-
views appear to be deceptive, suggesting that some
hotels may be posting fake positive reviews in order
to hype their own offerings.
In this work we distinguish between two kinds of
deceptive opinion spam, depending on the sentiment
expressed in the review. In particular, reviews in-
tended to promote or hype an offering, and which
therefore express a positive sentiment towards the
offering, are called positive deceptive opinion spam.
In contrast, reviews intended to disparage or slander
competitive offerings, and which therefore express a
negative sentiment towards the offering, are called
negative deceptive opinion spam. While previous
related work (Ott et al, 2011; Ott et al, 2012) has
explored characteristics of positive deceptive opin-
ion spam, the complementary problem of negative
deceptive opinion spam remains largely unstudied.
Following the framework of Ott et al (2011), we
use Amazon?s Mechanical Turk service to produce
the first publicly available1 dataset of negative de-
ceptive opinion spam, containing 400 gold standard
deceptive negative reviews of 20 popular Chicago
hotels. To validate the credibility of our decep-
tive reviews, we show that human deception detec-
tion performance on the negative reviews is low, in
agreement with decades of traditional deception de-
tection research (Bond and DePaulo, 2006). We then
show that standard n-gram text categorization tech-
niques can be used to detect negative deceptive opin-
ion spam with approximately 86% accuracy ? far

surpassing that of the human judges.
In conjunction with Ott et al (2011)?s positive de-
ceptive opinion spam dataset, we then explore the
interaction between sentiment and deception with
respect to three types of language features: (1)
changes in first-person singular use, often attributed
to psychological distancing (Newman et al, 2003),
(2) decreased spatial awareness and more narrative
form, consistent with theories of reality monitor-
ing (Johnson and Raye, 1981) and imaginative writ-
ing (Biber et al, 1999; Rayson et al, 2001), and (3)
increased negative emotion terms, often attributed to
leakage cues (Ekman and Friesen, 1969), but per-
haps better explained in our case as an exaggeration
of the underlying review sentiment.
2 Dataset
One of the biggest challenges facing studies of de-
ception is obtaining labeled data. Recently, Ott et
al. (2011) have proposed an approach for generat-
ing positive deceptive opinion spam using Amazon?s
popular Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service. In
this section we discuss our efforts to extend Ott et
al. (2011)?s dataset to additionally include negative
deceptive opinion spam.
2.1 Deceptive Reviews from Mechanical Turk
Deceptive negative reviews are gathered from Me-
chanical Turk using the same procedure as Ott et
al. (2011). In particular, we create and divide 400
HITs evenly across the 20 most popular hotels in
Chicago, such that we obtain 20 reviews for each
hotel. We allow workers to complete only a single
HIT each, so that each review is written by a unique
worker.2 We further require workers to be located
in the United States and to have an average past ap-
proval rating of at least 90%. We allow a maximum
of 30 minutes to complete the HIT, and reward ac-
cepted submissions with one US dollar ($1).
Each HIT instructs a worker to imagine that they
work for the marketing department of a hotel, and
that their manager has asked them to write a fake
negative review of a competitor?s hotel to be posted
online. Accompanying each HIT is the name and
2While Mechanical Turk does not provide a convenient
mechanism for ensuring the uniqueness of workers, this con-
straint can be enforced with Javascript. The script is available
at: http://uniqueturker.myleott.com.
URL of the hotel for which the fake negative re-
view is to be written, and instructions that: (1) work-
ers should not complete more than one similar HIT,
(2) submissions must be of sufficient quality, i.e.,
written for the correct hotel, legible, reasonable in
length,3 and not plagiarized,4 and, (3) the HIT is for
academic research purposes.
Submissions are manually inspected to ensure
that they are written for the correct hotel and to
ensure that they convey a generally negative senti-
ment.5 The average accepted review length was 178
words, higher than for the positive reviews gathered
by Ott et al (2011), who report an average review
length of 116 words.
2.2 Truthful Reviews from the Web
Negative (1- or 2-star) truthful reviews are mined
from six popular online review communities: Expe-
dia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline, TripAdvisor, and
Yelp. While reviews mined from these communities
cannot be considered gold standard truthful, recent
work (Mayzlin et al, 2012; Ott et al, 2012) suggests
that deception rates among travel review portals is
reasonably small.
Following Ott et al (2011), we sample a subset
of the available truthful reviews so that we retain an
equal number of truthful and deceptive reviews (20
each) for each hotel. However, because the truthful
reviews are on average longer than our deceptive re-
views, we sample the truthful reviews according to
a log-normal distribution fit to the lengths of our de-
ceptive reviews, similarly to Ott et al (2011).6
3 Deception Detection Performance
In this section we report the deception detection per-
formance of three human judges (Section 3.1) and
supervised n-gram Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers (Section 3.2).
3We define ?reasonable length? to be ? 150 characters.
4We use http://plagiarisma.net to determine
whether or not a review is plagiarized.
5We discarded and replaced approximately 2% of the sub-
missions, where it was clear that the worker had misread the
instructions and instead written a deceptive positive review.
6We use the R package GAMLSS (Rigby and Stasinopou-
los, 2005) to fit a log-normal distribution (left truncated at 150
characters) to the lengths of the deceptive reviews.

3.1 Human Performance
Recent large-scale meta-analyses have shown hu-
man deception detection performance is low, with
accuracies often not much better than chance (Bond
and DePaulo, 2006). Indeed, Ott et al (2011) found
that two out of three human judges were unable to
perform statistically significantly better than chance
(at the p < 0.05 level) at detecting positive decep-
tive opinion spam. Nevertheless, it is important to
subject our reviews to human judgments to validate
their convincingness. In particular, if human detec-
tion performance is found to be very high, then it
would cast doubt on the usefulness of the Mechan-
ical Turk approach for soliciting gold standard de-
ceptive opinion spam.
Following Ott et al (2011), we asked three vol-
unteer undergraduate university students to read and
make assessments on a subset of the negative review
dataset described in Section 2. Specifically, we ran-
domized all 40 deceptive and truthful reviews from
each of four hotels (160 reviews total). We then
asked the volunteers to read each review and mark
whether they believed it to be truthful or deceptive.
Performance for the three human judges appears
in Table 1. We additionally show the deception de-
tection performance of two meta-judges that aggre-
gate the assessments of the individual human judges:
(1) the MAJORITY meta-judge predicts deceptive
when at least two out of three human judges predict
deceptive (and truthful otherwise), and (2) the SKEP-
TIC meta-judge predicts deceptive when at least one
out of three human judges predicts deceptive (and
truthful otherwise).
A two-tailed binomial test suggests that JUDGE 1
and JUDGE 2 both perform better than chance (p =
0.0002, 0.003, respectively), while JUDGE 3 fails to
reject the null hypothesis of performing at-chance
(p = 0.07). However, while the best human judge
is accurate 65% of the time, inter-annotator agree-
ment computed using Fleiss? kappa is only slight
at 0.07 (Landis and Koch, 1977). Furthermore,
based on Cohen?s kappa, the highest pairwise inter-
annotator agreement is only 0.26, between JUDGE
1 and JUDGE 2. These low agreements suggest
that while the judges may perform statistically better
than chance, they are identifying different reviews
as deceptive, i.e., few reviews are consistently iden-
tified as deceptive.
3.2 Automated Classifier Performance
Standard n-gram?based text categorization tech-
niques have been shown to be effective at detect-
ing deception in text (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Mihal-
cea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott et al, 2011; Feng et
al., 2012). Following Ott et al (2011), we evaluate
the performance of linear Support Vector Machine
(SVM) classifiers trained with unigram and bigram
term-frequency features on our novel negative de-
ceptive opinion spam dataset. We employ the same
5-fold stratified cross-validation (CV) procedure as
Ott et al (2011), whereby for each cross-validation
iteration we train our model on all reviews for 16
hotels, and test our model on all reviews for the re-
maining 4 hotels. The SVM cost parameter, C, is
tuned by nested cross-validation on the training data.
Results appear in Table 2. Each row lists the sen-
timent of the train and test reviews, where ?Cross
Val.? corresponds to the cross-validation procedure
described above, and ?Held Out? corresponds to
classifiers trained on reviews of one sentiment and
tested on the other. The results suggest that n-gram?
based SVM classifiers can detect negative decep-
tive opinion spam in a balanced dataset with perfor-
mance far surpassing that of untrained human judges
(see Section 3.1). Furthermore, our results show that

classifiers trained and tested on reviews of differ-
ent sentiments perform worse, despite having more
training data,7 than classifiers trained and tested on
reviews of the same sentiment. This suggests that
cues to deception differ depending on the sentiment
of the text (see Section 4).
Interestingly, we find that training on the com-
bined sentiment dataset results in performance that
is comparable to that of the ?same sentiment? classi-
fiers (88.4% vs. 89.3% accuracy for positive reviews
and 86.0% vs. 86.0% accuracy for negative reviews).
This is explainable in part by the increased training
set size (1,280 vs. 640 reviews per 4 training folds).
4 Interaction of Sentiment and Deception
An important question is how language features op-
erate in our fake negative reviews compared with the
fake positive reviews of Ott et al (2011). For exam-
ple, fake positive reviews included less spatial lan-
guage (e.g., floor, small, location, etc.) because in-
dividuals who had not actually experienced the ho-
tel simply had less spatial detail available for their
review (Johnson and Raye, 1981). This was also the
case for our negative reviews, with less spatial lan-
guage observed for fake negative reviews relative to
truthful. Likewise, our fake negative reviews had
more verbs relative to nouns than truthful, suggest-
ing a more narrative style that is indicative of imag-
inative writing (Biber et al, 1999; Rayson et al,
2001), a pattern also observed by Ott et al (2011).
There were, however, several important differ-
ences in the deceptive language of fake negative rel-
ative to fake positive reviews. First, as might be
expected, negative emotion terms were more fre-
7?Cross Val.? classifiers are effectively trained on 80% of
the data and tested on the remaining 20%, whereas ?Held Out?
classifiers are trained and tested on 100% of each data.
quent, according to LIWC (Pennebaker et al, 2007),
in our fake negative reviews than in the fake posi-
tive reviews. But, importantly, the fake negative re-
viewers over-produced negative emotion terms (e.g.,
terrible, disappointed) relative to the truthful re-
views in the same way that fake positive reviewers
over-produced positive emotion terms (e.g., elegant,
luxurious). Combined, these data suggest that the
more frequent negative emotion terms in the present
dataset are not the result of ?leakage cues? that re-
veal the emotional distress of lying (Ekman and
Friesen, 1969). Instead, the differences suggest that
fake hotel reviewers exaggerate the sentiment they
are trying to convey relative to similarly-valenced
truthful reviews.
Second, the effect of deception on the pattern of
pronoun frequency was not the same across posi-
tive and negative reviews. In particular, while first
person singular pronouns were produced more fre-
quently in fake reviews than truthful, consistent with
the case for positive reviews, the increase was di-
minished in the negative reviews examined here. In
the positive reviews reported by Ott et al (2011),
the rate of first person singular in fake reviews
(M=4.36%, SD=2.96%) was twice the rate observed
in truthful reviews (M=2.18%, SD=2.04%). In con-
trast, the rate of first person singular in the deceptive
negative reviews (M=4.47%, SD=2.83%) was only
57% greater than for truthful reviews (M=2.85%,
SD=2.23%). These results suggest that the empha-
sis on the self, perhaps as a strategy of convinc-
ing the reader that the author had actually been to
the hotel, is not as evident in the fake negative re-
views, perhaps because the negative tone of the re-
views caused the reviewers to psychologically dis-
tance themselves from their negative statements, a
phenomenon observed in several other deception
studies, e.g., Hancock et al (2008).

5 Conclusion
We have created the first publicly-available corpus
of gold standard negative deceptive opinion spam,
containing 400 reviews of 20 Chicago hotels, which
we have used to compare the deception detection ca-
pabilities of untrained human judges and standard
n-gram?based Support Vector Machine classifiers.
Our results demonstrate that while human deception
detection performance is greater for negative rather
than positive deceptive opinion spam, the best detec-
tion performance is still achieved through automated
classifiers, with approximately 86% accuracy.
We have additionally explored, albeit briefly, the
relationship between sentiment and deception by
utilizing Ott et al (2011)?s positive deceptive opin-
ion spam dataset in conjunction with our own. In
particular, we have identified several features of lan-
guage that seem to remain consistent across senti-
ment, such as decreased awareness of spatial details
and exaggerated language. We have also identified
other features that vary with the sentiment, such as
first person singular use, although further work is re-
quired to determine if these differences may be ex-
ploited to improve deception detection performance.
Indeed, future work may wish to jointly model sen-
timent and deception in order to better determine the
effect each has on language use.
