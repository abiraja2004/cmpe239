ABSTRACT 
The Lincoln stress-resistant HMM CSR has been extended to large vocabulary continuous peech for both 
speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) tasks. Performance on the DARPA Resource Manage- 
ment task (991 word vocabulary, perplexity 60 word-pair grammar) \[1\] is 3.4% word error rate for SD training 
of word-context-dependent triphone models and 12.6% word error rate for SI training of (word-context-free) 
tied mixture triphone models. 
INTRODUCTION 
Our earlier development efforts \[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\] centered on improving the SD speaker-stress robustness for 
both IWR and CSR tasks. Since our IWR database included a normal speech test section, we were able to 
determine that our enhancements for robustness also improved performance for normally spoken speech (0 
errors/1680 test tokens, 105 word vocabulary, multi-style training). An independent test on the TI-20 word 
database \[10\] confirmed this normal speech performance with 3 errors out of 5120 test tokens on our first 
run on this database and no errors after a small amount of development \[3\]. Our robust CSR database was 
not useful for determining the large vocabulary normal speech performance. 
In order to work on a large vocabulary normal speech CSR task, we switched to the DARPA Resource 
Management database \[1\]. The SD portion of this database has 12 speakers with 600 training sentences and 
100 development test sentences per speaker. This provided a total of 1,200 test sentences containing 10,242 
words. For SI work we used the same development test sentences, but trained on 2,880 sentences from 72 
speakers from the SI training portion of the database. (There was an overlap of 8 speakers between the SI 
and SD training sets making the total of 80 speakers reported in \[1\].) When additional SI training data was 
needed, we added the designated "SI development test" data, again avoiding test speaker overlaps, to the 
designated SI training data. This provided a total 3,990 training sentences from 109 speakers. 
The vocabulary of the Resource Management database is 991 words. There is also an "official" word-pair 
recognition grammar \[11\]. This grammar is just a list of allowable word pairs without probabilities for the 
purpose of reducing the recognition perplexity to about 60. (Including the probabilities slightly more than 
halves the perplexity.) 
Working with a single development test set carries a risk of tuning one's system to idiosyncrasies in the test 
set due to the multiple tests and decisions performed uring algorithm development. Methodologies which 
focus on correcting the individual test set errors are particularly subject o this problem and become, in effect, 
corrective training \[12\] on the test set. In contrast, since different test sets have different inherent difficulties, 
comparisons of two systems using different est sets have a significantly reduced resolution. Therefore, the 
DARPA program has had several "official evaluation tests", the most recent of which was held in June 88. 
This test used 25 sentences from each of the 12 speakers (2,546 total words), all of which were new data that 
had not been used in the development process. These evaluation tests provide the best comparison between 
systems developed at different sites. The development test data, while less useful for comparing systems 
developed at different sites, is useful for judging progress over time at a single site, subject o the risk that a

THE " JUNE 88" CSR SYSTEM 
The "June 88" CSR system (which was used for the June 88 DARPA tests) uses a continuous observation 
HMM with triphone (left and right context-sensitive phone) models \[13\]. The observation probability density 
functions are diagonal covariance Gaussians with either a grand (shared) variance or a fixed perceptually- 
motivated variance. (Both give similar performance on normal speech; however, the perceptually motivated 
variance appears to be more robust to stress. The grand variance is used on the systems reported here.) 
The observation vector is a centisecond mel-cepstrum augmented with temporal back differences. The phone 
models have three states with no state skip transitions. Only one Gaussian per state is used in SD mode. 
The SI system is identical except hat fourth order Gaussian mixtures are used. 
The system is trained by an unsupervised bootstrapping procedure. The training data is not time-marked, 
only its orthographic transcription and a dictionary is required. The initial iterations of the Baum-Welch 
161 
algorithm are performed using monophone (context-free phone) models from a uniform initial state. This, 
in effect, automatically marks the data. The monophone models are then used to provide initial values for 
the (single Gaussian) triphone models and a few more iterations are performed. If mixtures are to be used, 
minor random perturbations ofthe single Gaussian mean vectors are used to initialize the Gaussian mixtures 
and a few final iterations are performed. 
During recognition, the system extrapolates (guesses based upon a linear combination of the available tri- 
phones) the triphones which were not observed uring training. The recognition environment is modeled by 
adaptive background states. In order to control the relative number of word insertions and deletions, the 
likelihood is multiplied by a penalty for each word. A Viterbi beam search using a finite state grammar with 
optional interword silences produces the recognized output. 
RESULTS OF THE JUNE 88 TEST SYSTEM 
The SD June 88 test system used word-context-free triphones (i.e., the triphone contexts included word 
boundaries, but excluded the phone on the other side of the boundary). Since the pronunciation of function 
words is often idiosyncratic, the triphones for the function words were also word-dependent \[14\]. The resulting 
system has 2,434 triphones, 2,413 of which were observed at least once in training and 21 of which were 
extrapolated by the recognizer. (The same training scripts were used for all 12 SD speakers.) The SD word 
error rates were 5.46% for the June 88 test set and 5.19% for the development test set. 
The SI dune 88 test system used the same set of triphones as the SD system. Due to the more varied 
training data, 2,430 triphones were observed, many from only a few speakers. The word error rate for this 
system is 13.55% for the June 88 test set and 13.25% for the development test set. The large training set 
(2,431 observed triphones) produced 10.09% word error rate for the dune 88 test set and 10.85% for the 
development test set. 
WORD BOUNDARY MODELS 
The SD system was improved significantly by the addition of word boundary triphone models. (The word- 
boundary triphones are distinct from word-internal triphones.) In this system, the training data is used twice 
per Baum-Welch iteration, once to train word-context-free (WCF) models and once to train word-context- 
dependent models. The same word-internal triphones are used both times. This provides the recognizer 
with a set of models for the observed word boundaries and a set of WCF models to be used for word 
boundaries allowed by the grammar but not observed in the training data. This reduces the number of 
phones extrapolated in the recognizer. 
The number of triphones is more than doubled by the added word boundary models. The SD trainer produces 
5,993 triphones: 2,413 WCF and 3,580 word context riphones. In addition, the recognizer extrapolates 443 
more triphones. 
Inclusion of word contexts ignificantly increases the recognition etwork complexity. Depending on the 
number of phones in the word, there are three word topologies which must be covered (Figure 1): 
1. Three or more phones: each word end has a fan of initial (final) phones. 
2. Two phones: each word end has a list of initial and final phones with a crossbar of interconnections 
between them. 
3. One phone: a crossbar between beginnings and endings with a triphone on each link. 
Links between two adjacent words are formed according to the following priority list: 
1. Both boundary triphones exist: link them.

by'? ?ya ~ ay? 
CASE 2: WORD HAS 2 PHONES CASE 3: WORD HAS 1 PHONE 
Figure 1: Word-context-dependent word model topologies. 
2. Only one of the boundary triphones exist: link to a WCF triphone on the other word. 
3. Neither boundary triphone exists: link WCF boundary triphones from both words. 
Thus, as more word boundaries are observed in the training data, the system gradually builds from the 
original WCF system toward a system with full word context models. 
The SD development test results for this system showed a significant improvement over the WCF system: 
3.39% versus 5.19% word error rate. An earlier system which extrapolated all missing boundary triphones 
rather the defaulting to WCF triphones did not show an improvement. Thus it is better to use observed 
WCF triphones rather than extrapolate boundary triphones. The SI results were worse than the WCF 
system, both with and without the additional training data. The word-context-dependent system appears 
to be too detailed a model for the available SI training data. 
VARIABLE MIXTURES 
Variable order mixtures how a small improvement for the SI task. The number of mixtures for the states 
in a triphone was chosen by: 
163 
rain(n, sqrt \[(number o$ instances of triphone in data)J )
This attempts to match the complexity of the distribution to the amount of available training data. It has 
been tested for n = 4 and n = 8 with both the normal and augmented training sets. The results are in 
Table 3. The variable mixtures how an improvement for n = 4 for the standard training and n = 8 for the 
augmented training. These results show that the basic idea improves performance but the function is not 
optimum for choosing the mixture order. If the function were optimum, the best results would he obtained 
for any large n.

T IED MIXTURES 
A version of tied mixtures \[15,16\] has been tested and shown to provide a small improvement for the SI task. 
In this system, each monophone group is given a set of Gaussians. All triphones of each monophone group 
use mixtures chosen from the same set of Gaussians. The mixture weights for each triphone are independent 
of all other triphones. This reduces the total number of Gaussians by a significant factor. 
Training is again performed using a bootstrapping procedure. After the monophones are trained, small 
random perturbations of their mean vectors are used to initialize the mixture Gaussians for the monophone 
group. The triphone weights, along with the parameters of the Gaussians, are then trained with a number 
of iterations of the Baum-Welch algorithm. 
The recognizer used here is the simpler WCF system. Three SI systems were tried using 10, 20, and 40 
Ganssians per monophone group. Only the 40 system showed an improvement over the original SI system: 
12.62% versus 13.25% development test word error rate. This system also reduced the number of Gaussians 
by a factor of five. Tied mixtures have not been tried on the SD task. 
SPEAKER GROUPING 
Another approach to improving the SI (WCF) performance was tried. The training speakers were segregated 
by sex and two separate sets of models were trained. The recognizer kept the sets of models separate by 
using two separate networks. Thus, the system co-recognizes both the speech and the sex of the speaker. 
Systems which lump both sexes together in training do not discriminate against cross-group spectral matches 
of individual sounds. Mixtures were not used to save CPU time. The results shown in Table 4 show a 
significant increase in the error rate.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Word context modeling reduced the word error rate of the SD system by 35%. This significantly increased 
both the number of triphones and the complexity of the recognizer. Fully, 39% of the triphones occurred 
only once in the training data compared to 19% for the WCF system. However, since the system is speaker- 
dependent and (almost) only Gaussian means were being trained, the system was able to improve in spite 
of the limited training data. 
Word-context modeling did not help the SI system, probably due to insufficient raining data. Thirty-two 
percent of the triphones (mostly word boundary), in contrast o 3.7% for the WCF system, occurred only 
one or two times in the training data. This is not sufficient o train an SI system. Since many of the 
word-context-dependent triphones were adapted to only one or two speakers, more damage than good was 
done. The larger SI training data set reduced the number of single and double occurrence triphones to 22%, 
which helped, but was not enough to overcome the problem. 
Variable order mixtures (WCF) improved the SI results by matching the complexity of the distributions to 
the amount of training data. This approach required essentially no increase in the complexity of the trainer. 
The (WCF) tied mixture system achieved a small improvement over the June 88 SI system. This was 
probably due to the high-order mixtures of the shared Gaussians. This allowed more detailed modeling 
where there was sufficient raining data while allowing the system to automatically reduce its degrees of 
freedom where there was insufficient training data by placing very low or zero weights on unneeded mixture 
components. Training, however, requires o much computation that it will hamper exploration of this class 
of system. 
Grouping the speakers (WCF) yielded sufficiently poor results that mixtures were not tested. The recognizer 
did appear to correctly identify the sex of the speaker. The reduction in performance may be due to an 
effect similar to multi-style training \[5\] which may be enhanced by mixing the sexes during training.
