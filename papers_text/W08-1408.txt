Abstract 
The Europe Media Monitor system 
(EMM) gathers and aggregates an aver-
age of 50,000 newspaper articles per day 
in over 40 languages. To manage the in-
formation overflow, it was decided to 
group similar articles per day and per 
language into clusters and to link daily 
clusters over time into stories. A story 
automatically comes into existence when 
related groups of articles occur within a 
7-day window. While cross-lingual links 
across 19 languages for individual news 
clusters have been displayed since 2004 
as part of a freely accessible online appli-
cation (http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer), 
the newest development is work on link-
ing entire stories across languages. The 
evaluation of the monolingual aggrega-
tion of historical clusters into stories and 
of the linking of stories across languages 
yielded mostly satisfying results. 
1 Introduction 
Large amounts of information are published 
daily on news web portals around the world. Pre-
senting the most important news on simple, 
newspaper-like pages is enough when the user 
wants to be informed about the latest news. 
However, such websites do not provide a long-
term view on how any given story or event de-
veloped over time. Our objective is to provide 
users with a fully automatic tool that groups in-
dividual news articles every day into clusters of 
related news and to aggregate the daily clusters 
into stories, by linking them to the related ones

identified in the previous weeks and months. In 
our jargon, stories are thus groups of articles 
talking about a similar event or theme over time. 
We work with the daily clusters computed by the 
NewsExplorer application (Pouliquen et al 
2004). For each daily cluster in currently nine-
teen languages, the similarity to all clusters pro-
duced during the previous seven days is com-
puted and a link is established if the similarity is 
above a certain threshold. It is on the basis of 
these individual links that stories are built, i.e. 
longer chains of news clusters related over time. 
The current NewsExplorer application addition-
ally identifies for all news clusters, whether there 
are related clusters in the other languages. These 
daily cross-lingual links are used to link the 
longer-lasting stories across languages. 
After a review of related work (Section  1 2), 
we will present the Europe Media Monitor 
(EMM) system and its NewsExplorer application 
(section  3). We will then provide details on the 
process to build the multi-monolingual stories 
(Section  4) and on the more recent work on link-
ing stories across languages (Section  5). Sec-
tion  6 presents evaluation results both for the 
monolingual story compilation and for the estab-
lishment of cross-lingual links. Section  7 con-
cludes and points to future work.  
2 Related work 
The presented work falls into the two fields of 
Topic Detection and Tracking and cross-lingual 
document similarity calculation.  
2.1 Topic detection and tracking (TDT) 
TDT was promoted and meticulously defined by 
the US-American DARPA programme (see 
Wayne 2000). An example explaining the TDT 
concept was that of the Oklahoma City bombing 
in 1995, where not only the bombing, but also 
the related memorial services, investigations, 
prosecution etc. were supposed to be captured. 
49
Human evaluators will often differ in their opin-
ion whether a given document belongs to a topic 
or not, especially as ?topic? can be defined 
broadly (e.g. the Iraq war and the following pe-
riod of insurgence) or more specifically. For in-
stance, the capture and prosecution of Saddam 
Hussein, individual roadside bombings and air 
strikes, or the killing of Al Qaeda leader Abu 
Musab al-Zarqawi could either be seen as indi-
vidual topics or as part of the Iraq war. This 
fuzziness regarding what is a ?topic? makes a 
formal evaluation rather difficult. Our system is 
more inclusive and will thus include all the men-
tioned sub-events into one topic (story). A sepa-
rate clustering system was developed as part of 
the EMM-NewsBrief (http://press.jrc.it/NewsBrief/), 
which produces more short-lived and thus more 
specific historical cluster links. 
2.2 Cross-lingual linking of documents 
Since 2000, the TDT task was part of the TIDES 
programme (Translingual Information Detection, 
Extraction and Summarisation), which focused 
on cross-lingual information access. The goal of 
TIDES was to enable English-speaking users to 
access, correlate and interpret multilingual 
sources of real-time information and to share the 
essence of this information with collaborators. 
The purpose of our own work includes the topic 
detection and tracking as well as the cross-
lingual aspect. Main differences between our 
own work and TIDES are that we need to moni-
tor more languages, that we are interested in all 
cross-lingual links (as opposed to targeting only 
English), and that we use different methods to 
establish cross-lingual links (see Section 5). 
All TDT and TIDES participants used either 
Machine Translation (MT; e.g. Leek et al 1999) 
or bilingual dictionaries (e.g. Wactlar 1999) for 
the cross-lingual tasks. Performance was always 
lower for cross-lingual topic tracking (Wayne 
2000). An interesting insight was formulated in 
the ?native language hypothesis? by Larkey et al
(2004), which states that topic tracking works 
better in the original language than in (ma-
chine-)translated collections. Various partici-
pants stated that the usage of named entities 
helped (Wayne 2000). Taking these insights into 
account, we always work in the source language 
and make intensive use of named entities. 
Outside TDT, an additional two approaches 
for linking related documents across languages 
have been proposed, both of which use bilingual 
vector space models: Landauer & Littman (1991) 
used bilingual Lexical Semantic Analysis and Vi-
nokourov et al (2002) used Kernel Canonical 
Correlation Analysis. These and the approaches 
using MT or bilingual dictionaries have in com-
mon that they require bilingual resources and are 
thus not easily scalable for many language pairs. 
For N languages, there are N*(N-1)/2 language 
pairs (e.g. for 20 languages, there are 190 lan-
guage pairs and 380 language pair directions). 
Due to the multilinguality requirement in the 
European Union (EU) context (there are 23 offi-
cial EU languages as of 2007), Steinberger et al 
(2004) proposed to produce an interlingual docu-
ment (or document cluster) representation based 
on named entities (persons, organisations, disam-
biguated locations), units of measurement, multi-
lingual specialist taxonomies (e.g. medicine), 
thesauri and other similar resources that may help 
produce a language-independent document repre-
sentation. Similarly to Steinberger et al (2004), 
the work described in the following sections 
equally goes beyond the language pair-specific 
approach, but it does not make use of the whole 
range of information types.  
In Pouliquen et al (2004), we showed how 
NewsExplorer links individual news clusters 
over time and across languages, but without ag-
gregating the clusters into the more compact and 
high-level representations (which we call sto-
ries). This new level of abstraction was achieved 
by exploiting the monolingual and cross-lingual 
cluster links and by adding additional filtering 
heuristics to eliminate wrong story candidate 
clusters. As a result, long-term developments can 
now be visualised in timelines and users can ex-
plore the development of events over long time 
periods (see Section  4.2). Additionally, meta-
information for each story can be compiled 
automatically, including article and cluster statis-
tics as well as lists of named entities associated 
to a given story.  
2.3 Commercial applications 
Compared to commercial or other publicly accessi-
ble news analysis and navigation applications, the 
one presented here is unique in that it is the only 
one offering automatic linking of news items re-
lated either historically or across languages. The 
news aggregators Google News 
(http://news.google.com) and Yahoo! News 
(http://news.yahoo.com/), for instance, deliver daily 
news in multiple languages, but do not link the 
found articles over time or across languages. The 
monolingual English language applications Day-
Life (http://www.daylife.com/), SiloBreaker 
(http://www.silobreaker.com/), and NewsVine

clusters: The graph shows the cosine similarity 
between today?s English language cluster (Final 
hole being drilled ?) and seven clusters identi-
fied during five previous days. Only clusters with 
a similarity above 0.5 will be retained. 
(http://www.newsvine.com/) do not link related news 
over time either. NewsTin (http://www.newstin.com) 
is the only one to offer more languages (ten) and to 
categorise news into a number of broad categories, 
but  they, again, do not link related news over time 
or across languages.  
3 Europe Media Monitor (EMM) & 
NewsExplorer 
EMM has been gathering multilingual news arti-
cles from many different web portals since 2002. 
It?s NewsBrief application has since displayed 
the world?s most recent news items on its public 
web servers (http://emm.jrc.it/overview.html). 
Every day, and for each of 19 languages sepa-
rately, EMM?s NewsExplorer application groups 
related articles into clusters. Clusters are com-
puted using a group average agglomerative bot-
tom-up clustering algorithm (similar to Schultz 
& Liberman 1999). Each article is represented as 
a vector of keywords with the keywords being 
the words of the text (except stop words) and 
their weight being the log-likelihood value com-
puted using word frequency lists based on sev-
eral years of news. We additionally enrich the 
vector space representation of each cluster with 
country information (see Pouliquen et al, 2004), 
based on log-likelihood-weighted, automatically 
recognised and disambiguated location and coun-
try names (see Pouliquen et al 2006).  
Each computed daily cluster consists of its 
keywords (i.e. the average log-likelihood weight 
for each word) and the title of the cluster?s me-
doid (i.e. the article closest to the centroid of the 
cluster). In addition we enrich the cluster with 
features that will be used in further processes. 
These include the cluster size, lists of persons, 
organisations, geo-locations and subject domain 
codes (see Section  5). 
When comparing two clusters in the same lan-
guage, the keywords offer a good representation 
(especially when the keywords are enriched with 
the country information). Section  5 will show 
that the additional ingredients are useful to com-
pare two clusters in different languages. 
4 Building stories enriched with meta-
information 
For each language separately and for each individ-
ual cluster of the day, we compute the cosine simi-
larity with all clusters of the past 7 days (see Fig-
ure 1). Similarity is based on the keywords associ-
ated with each cluster. If the similarity between the 
keyword vectors of two clusters is above the em-
pirically derived threshold of 0.5, clusters are 
linked. This optimised threshold was established by 
evaluating cluster linking in several languages (see 
Pouliquen et al 2004). A cluster can be linked to 
several previous clusters, and it can even be linked 
to two different clusters of the same day. 
4.1 Building stories by linking clusters over 
time 
Stories are composed of several clusters. If a new 
cluster is similar to clusters that are part of a 
story, it is likely that this new cluster is a con-
tinuation of the existing story. For the purpose of 
building stories, individual and yet unlinked clus-
ters of the previous seven days are treated like 
(single cluster) stories. If clusters have not been 
linked to within seven days, they remain individ-
ual clusters that are not part of a story. Building 
stories out of clusters is done using the following 
incremental algorithm (for a given day): 
for each cluster c  
 for each story s  
  score[s]=0; 
 for each cluster cp (linked to c) 
  if (s: story containing cp) then 
  score[s] += (1-score[s])*sim(cp,s); 
  endif 
 endfor 
 endfor 
 if (s: story having the maximum score) 
 then 
  add c to story s (with sim score[s]) 
 else // not similar to any story 
  create new story containing only c 
 endif 
endfor

with sim(cp,s) being the similarity of the cluster 
to the story (the first cluster of a story gets a sim 
of 1, the following depend on the score com-
puted by the algorithm). 
When deciding whether a new cluster should 
be part of an existing story, the challenge is to 
combine the similarities of the new cluster with 
each of the clusters in the story. As stories 
change over time and the purpose is to link the 
newest events to existing stories, the new cluster 
is only compared to the story?s clusters of the last 
7 days. A seven-day window is intuitive and 
automatically takes care of fluctuations regarding 
the number of articles during the week (week-
ends are quieter). In the algorithm to determine 
whether the new cluster is linked to the story, the 
similarity score is computed incrementally: The 
score is the similarity of the new cluster with the 
latest cluster of the story (typically yesterday?s) 
plus the similarity of the new cluster with the 
story?s cluster of the day before multiplied with a 
reducing factor (1-scorei-1), plus the similarity of 
the new cluster with the story?s cluster of yet an-
other day before multiplied with a reducing fac-
tor (1-scorei-2), etc. The reducing factor helps to 
keep the similarity score between the theoretical 
values 0 (unrelated) and 1 (highly related):

If the final score is above the threshold of 0.5, 
the cluster gets linked to the existing story. 
Otherwise it remains unlinked. The story building 
algorithm is language-independent and could thus 
be applied to all of the 19 NewsExplorer lan-
guages. Currently, it is run every day (in 
sequential order) in the following nine languages: 
Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, 
Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish and Swedish. 
Out of the daily average of 970 new clusters 
(average computed for all nine languages over a 
period of one month), only 281 get linked to an 
existing story (29%) and 90 contribute to a new 
story (9%). The remaining 599 clusters (62%) 
remain unlinked singleton clusters. A small num-
ber of stories are very big and go on over a long 
time. This reflects big media issues such as the 
Iraq insurgence, the Iran-nuclear negotiations 
and the Israel-Palestine conflict. The latter is the 
currently longest story ever (see 
http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer/storyedition/en/RTERadio-
5f47a76fe35215964cbab22dcbc88d7b.html).  
4.2 Aggregating and displaying information 
about each story 
For each story, daily updated information gets 
stored in the NewsExplorer knowledge base. 
This includes (a) the title of the first cluster of 
the story (i.e. the title of the medoid article of 
that first cluster); (b) the title of the biggest clus-
ter of the story (i.e. the cluster with most arti-
cles); (c) the most frequently mentioned person 
names in the story (related people); (d) the per-
son names most highly associated to the story 
(associated people, see below); (e) the most fre-
quently mentioned other names in the story 
(mostly organisations, but also events such as 
Olympics, World War II, etc.); (f) the countries 
most frequently referred to in the story (either 
directly with the country name or indirectly, e.g. 
by referring to a city in that country); (g) a list of 
keywords describing the story (see below). This 
meta-information is exported every day into 
XML files for display on NewsExplorer. The 
public web pages display up to 13 keywords, in-
cluding up to three country names and up to two 
person or organisation names (see Table 1). To 
52
see examples of all meta-information types for 
each story, see the NewsExplorer pages.  
Stories are currently accessible through three 
different indexes (see Figure 2): the stories of the 
week, the stories of the month and the biggest 
stories (all displayed on the main page of 
NewsExplorer). The biggest stories are ordered 
by the number of clusters they contain without 
any consideration of the beginning date or the 
end date. The stories of the month present stories 
that started within the last 30 days, stories of the 
week those that started within the last seven 
days. 
For each story, a time line graph (a flash ap-
plication taking an XML export as input) is pro-
duced automatically, allowing users to see trends 
and to navigate and explore the story (Figure 3). 
While a story can have more than one cluster on 
a given day, the graph only displays the largest 
cluster for that day. 
The story?s keyword signature is computed us-
ing the keywords appearing in most of the con-
stituent clusters. If any of the keywords repre-
sents a country, it will be displayed first. A filter-
ing function eliminates keywords that are part of 
one of the selected entities. For instance, if a se-
lected entity is George W. Bush and a selected 
country is Iraq, the keywords Bush, George, 
Iraqi, etc. will not be displayed. 
 
Figure 2. Examples of English language stories, as on the NewsExplorer main page (2.04. 2008). 
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a 
story?s related entities are those that have been 
mentioned most frequently. This typically in-
cludes many media VIPs. Associated entities are 
names that appear in this particular story, but are 
not so frequently mentioned in news clusters out-
side this story, according to the following,

with fr(e) being the number of clusters the entity 
appears in (in a collection of three years of news) 
and C(S,e) being the number of clusters in the 
story S mentioning the entity. Inversely, the 
NewsExplorer person and organisation pages 
also display, for each entity, the biggest stories 
they are involved in.

5 Cross-lingual cluster and story linking 
For each daily cluster in nine NewsExplorer lan-
guages, the similarity to clusters in the other 18 
languages is computed. To achieve this, we pro-
duce three different language-independent vector 
representations for each cluster (for details, see 
Pouliquen et al 2004): a weighted list of Euro-
voc subject domain descriptors (eurov, available 
only for EU languages), a frequency list of per-
son and organisation names (ent), and a weighted 
list of direct or indirect references to countries 
(geo). As a fourth ingredient, we also make use 
of language-dependent keyword lists because 
even monolingual keywords sometimes match 
53
across languages due to cognate words (cog), etc. 
(e.g. tsunami, airlines, Tibet etc.). The overall 
similarity clsim for two clusters c? and c?? in dif-
ferent languages is calculated using a linear 
combination of the four cosine similarities, using 
the values for ???? &,, as 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 
0.1, respectively (see Figure 4):

5.1 Filtering and refining cross-lingual clus-
ter links 
The process described in the previous paragraphs 
produces some unwanted cross-lingual links. We 
also observed that not all cross-lingual links are 
transitive although they should be. We thus de-
veloped an additional filtering and link weighting 
algorithm to improve matters, whose basic idea 
is the following: When clusters are linked in 
more than two languages, our assumption is: If 
cluster A is linked to cluster B and cluster C, 
then cluster B should also be linked to cluster C. 
We furthermore assume that if cluster B is not 
linked to cluster C, then cluster B is less likely to 
be linked to cluster A. The new algorithm thus 
checks these ?inter-links? and calculates a new 
similarity value which combines the standard 
similarity (described in 5.0) with the number of 
inter-links. The formula punishes links to an iso-
lated cluster (i.e. links to a target language clus-
ter which itself is not linked to other linked lan-
guages) and raises the score for inter-linked clus-
ters (i.e. links to a target language cluster which 
itself is linked to other linked languages). The 
new similarity score uses the formula: 
)(
)(
).,(),(
CEl

????=????    
with Cl(C) being the number of computed cross-
lingual links and El(C) being the number of ex-
pected cross-links (i.e. all cross-language links 
observed when looking at all languages). For in-
stance, if a cluster is linked to three languages 
and these are linked to a further three, then 
Cl(C?)=3 and El(C?)=6.  
Figure 4. Example of the similarity calculation 
for an English and a French cluster. The overall 
similarity for these two clusters, based on the lin-
ear combination of four  different vectors, is 0.46.  
5.2 Linking whole stories across languages  
The stories contain clusters which are themselves 
linked to clusters in other languages (see 5.1). 
This information can be used to compute the 
similarity between two whole stories in different 
languages. The formula is quite simple:

with S' and S'' being two stories in different lan-
guages, and c' and c'' being constituent clusters. 
Cross-lingual cluster similarity values are only 
added if they are above the threshold of 0.15. 
Table 2 shows an English story and its links in 
seven languages. 
As the evaluation results in Section 6 show, this 
formula produces reasonable results, but it has 
some limitations. Firstly, it relies exclusively on 
Lang.

necessarily reported on the same day across lan-

better results by making use of the available 
meta-information at story level described in Sec-
tion 4.2. We are thus planning to refine this for-
mula in future work.

6 Evaluation 
Evaluating such a system is not straightforward 
as there is a lot of room for  interpretation re-
garding the relatedness of clusters and stories. 
Cluster consistency evaluation and the monolin-
gual and cross-lingual linking of individual clus-
ters using a very similar approach has already 
been evaluated in Pouliquen et al (2004).  
In order to evaluate the precision for the story 
building in four languages, we have evaluated 
the relatedness of the individual components (the 
clusters) with the story itself. We compiled a list 
of 330 randomly selected stories (in the 4 lan-
guages English, German, Italian and Spanish) 
and asked an expert to judge if each of the clus-
ters is linked to the main story. For each story, 
we thus have a ratio of 'correctly linked' clusters 
(see Table 3). The average ratio corresponds to 
the precision of the story tracking system. There 
clearly is room for improvement, but we found the 
results good enough to display the automatically 
identified stories as part of the live application.  
We did make an attempt at evaluating also the 
recall for story building, but soon found out that 
the results would not make sense. The idea was 
to carry out a usage-oriented evaluation for the 
situation in which users are looking for any story 
of their choice using their own search words (e.g. 
Oscar and nomination, Pavarotti and death, 
etc.). It was found that relevant stories did indeed 
exist for almost every query. However, the re-
sults would entirely depend on the type of story 
the evaluator is looking for and on the evalua-
tor?s capacity to identify significant search 
words. We can thus not present results for the re-
call evaluation of the story tracking system. 
The purpose of a second test was to evaluate 
the accuracy of the cross-lingual story linking. 
For that purpose, we evaluated those 112 multi-
lingual stories out of the 330 stories in the previ-
ous experiment that had cross-lingual links to 
any of the languages Dutch, English, French, 
German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or Swedish. 
Table 4 shows that only 59% of the automati-
cally established cross-lingual story links were 
accurate, but that the situation improves when 
looking at stories consisting of more clusters, i.e. 
5 or 10. This trend was confirmed by a separate 
study evaluating only the cross-lingual links for 
the 10 largest stories in the same four languages, 
into the same eight other languages: 87% of the 
cross-lingual links were correct. Note that ? for 
these large stories ? the cross-lingual links were 
96.5% complete (270 out of 280 possible links 
were present). Further insights from this evalua-
tion are that there are only two out of the 40 top 
stories that should be merged (there are two Eng-
lish top stories on Israel) and that there is one 
cluster in each of the four languages which 
should be split (all China-related news merges 
into one story). It is clear that more experiments 
are needed to improve the cross-lingual links for 
smaller stories. We have not evaluated the recall 
of the cross-lingual story linking as recall evalua-
tion is very time-consuming and we first want to 
optimise the algorithm.

Table 3. Evaluation of the monolingual linking 
of clusters into stories for four languages. 
The story tracking system has been running for 
two years. There is definitely space for improve-
ment as unrelated clusters are sometimes part of 
a story, but informal positive user feedback 
makes us believe that users already find the cur-
rent results useful. An analysis of the web logs 
shows that more than 400 separate visitors per 
day look at story-related information, split quite 
evenly across the different languages (Table 5).

 The story tracking algorithm is rather sensi-
tive to the starting date for the process: Different 
starting dates may result in different stories and 
certain starting dates may result in having two 
separate parallel stories talking about very 
closely related subjects. Another issue is the 
seven-day window: We may want to extend the 
window as it happens occasionally that a story 
?dies? because no related articles are published 
on the subject for a week, and that another story 
talking about the same subject starts 8 days later. 
Finally, our algorithm should try to cope with the 
fact that stories can split or merge (an issue not 
currently dealt with), but this is a non-trivial issue. 
Regarding the cross-lingual linking, the current 
results are encouraging, but not sufficient. The ac-
curacy needs to be improved before the results can 
go online. The most promising idea here is to 
make use of each story?s meta-information (lists 
of related persons, organisations, countries and 
keywords at story level) and to allow a time de-
lay in the publication of stories across languages. 
However, the application has high potential, as it 
will provide users with (graphically visualisable) 
information on how the media report events 
across languages and countries.  
In a separate effort, a ?live? news clustering 
system has been developed within EMM, which 
groups the news as they come in during the day 
(see http://press.jrc.it/NewsBrief/). This process 
needs to be integrated with the daily and more 
long-term story tracking process so that users can 
explore the history and the background for cur-
rent events.
