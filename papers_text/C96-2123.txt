Abstract 
The objective of this pal)er is to \[brmal- 
ize the intuition al)out l,he comph;xity 
of syntactic structures. We propose a 
definition of structm:al COml)h'xity such 
that sentences ranked by our definition 
as more COml)h;x are gen(;rally more diI'- 
ficult lbr humans to process. We justify 
the definition by showing how it is ahle to 
account for several seemingly unrelated 
phenomena in natural anguages. 
1 Introduction 
Intuitive\]y, certain syntactic structures arc uLore 
difficult for htnnans to process thau others. For 
example, compare the following to sentences: 
(1) a. 'Fhe cat that the dog that the man 
bought chased died. 
b. The man bought the dog that chased 
the cat that died. 
It is ohvious that sentence (la.) is much mor(' dif- 
ficult to understarld than (1 b). Since the two sen- 
tences are of the same length an(l involve the same 
set of semantic relationships, the ditliculty in rm- 
derstan(ling (1 a) can only be attributed to its syn- 
tactic structure. 
'\['he objecl;ive of this pal)er is to fortnalize the 
intuition a.bout the complexity of syutactic stru(> 
tures. We propose a detinition of s t ruc tura l  
colnI)h~xil;y (SC) such thai; sentences ranked by 
our definition as more complex are generally more 
difficult for humans to process than otherwise sim- 
ilar sentences, hi other words, suppose a pair of 
sentences A arid B consist of the same set of words 
and have essentially the same meaning, then sen- 
tence A is more difficult to process than sentence 
1~ if SC(A)>SC(B). For example, the proposed 
detinition of structural complexity correctly pre-

'I'll(: notiou of structural complexity proposed 
in this l)apc'r oilers explanations \['or a set of seem- 
iugly unrelated phenomena: 
? We will show dlat the definition of structural 
comph:xity explains why a I)utch sentence in- 
volving cross-serial dependencies i sliglrdy 
easier to underst~md than a corresponding 
cenl, er-embedded German sentence. 
? We will also show that extrapositions, uch as 
heavy-NP shift and PP extractions are moti- 
vated by reducing syntactic omplexity. The 
extraposition of an element is only warranted 
when the. structural COml)lexity of the sen- 
I.en(:e is reduced as a result. 
? NP ntodifiers of a head tend to be closer to 
the head than its PP modifiers, which in turn 
tend to be closer than its CP (clausal) modi- 
tiers. In Generalized Phrase Strcuture Gram- 
mar ((~VS(~) (Gazd~u" ctal. ,  1985), these lin- 
ear order constraints are stated explicitly in 
the gralIllnar. The notion of structured com- 
plexity provides an explanatory account. 
'l'here are several reasons why the notion of 
strHCtltl:a\] COml)lexity ix tlseful. Firstly, in nat- 
ural language generation, a generator should get> 
era.re the simphest sentence that conveys the in- 
tended meanings. Structural complexity can be 
used to choose l;he syntactic strnctures with l;he 
lowest structural complexity so that the resulting 
sentence is easier to understand than other alter- 
natives. 
Secondly, structural complexity is also needed 
in assessing the readability of dommtents. \[t is 
well known that the length of a sentence is not, a 
relit~ble indicator of its readability. Yet, the read- 
ability of texts has up to now heen measured by 
tlJe lengths of sentences and familiarities of th(: 
words in the documents. Using structural com- 
plexity instead of sentence length allows the read- 
~fl)ility of documents to be measured tnorc accu- 
rately. 
Finally, we propose, in Section 4, that extrapo- 
sitions ~re rnotiw~ted by reduction of structural 
729 
complexity. In other words, extrapositions are 
only allowed if the structural complexity of tile 
sentence is reduced as a result. This constraint 
is nsefnl both in parsing sentences with extrapo- 
sitions and in deciding where to use extraposition 
during generation. 
The notion of structural complexity is defined in 
Section 2. We then justify the definition of struc- 
tural complexity by demonstrating in Sections 3, 
4, and 5 that sentences with lower structural com- 
plexity are easier to understand than otherwise 
similar sentences with higher structural complex- 
ity. 
2 Structural Complexity 
The definition of structural complexity presumes 
the notion of dependency relationships between 
words in a sentence. In dependency grammars 
(Hudson, 1984; Mel'Suk, 1987), a dependency re- 
lationship is a primitive relationship between two 
words, called the head  and the modi f ier .  In 
constituency grammars that contain the X-bar 
theory as a component, dependency relationships 
between words are implicitly specified in X-bar 
structures. The modifiers of a word w are the head 
words of the specifier, complements, and adjuncts 
of w. For example, Figure 1 is the X-bar struc- 
ture of (2). The word "will" has two modifiers: 
the head word ()fits NP specifier ("Kinf ' )  and the 
head word of its VP complement ("bring"). The 
dependency relationships in tim X-bar structure 
in l!'igure 1 are shown in Figure 2. Each directed 
link in Fignre 2 represents a dependency relation- 
ship with the direction going from the head to the 
modifier.

Figure 2: t)ependency structure of (2) 
In order to recognize the structure of a sentence, 
a parser must establish the dependency links be- 
tween the words in the sentence. Structural com- 
plexity measures how easy or di\[\[icnlt i is to es- 
tablish these dependency links. The definition of 
structural complexity is based on the assumption 
that the shorter dependency links are easier to es-- 
tablish than longer ones, where the length of a 
dependency link is one plns the nmnber of words 
between the head and the moditier. I:or e.xample, 
the lengths of tile links in Figure 2 are shown by 
the numbers attached to the dependency links. 
Def in i t ion  2.1 (S t ruetura l  Complex i ty )  
The slructural complexity of a dependency struc- 
lure is the total length of the dependency links in 
the structure. 
For example the structural complexity of the de- 
pendency structure in Figure 2 is 11. 
\[n the next three sections, we will show that 
the definition of structural comph'.xity does i,- 
deed retlect the difficulty in processing a sentence. 
We will present examples in which sentences with 
lower structural complexities are easier to process 
than similar sentences with higher structural com- 
ph;xities. 
3 Center  embedd ing  
The difficulty in processing center embedding sen- 
ten('es: such as (13), hgs been explained by its 
requirement on the size of tile stack in a parsb, r.
This explanation presumes that the human parser 
uses a push-down stack to store the partially built 
constituents. 'l'he notion of structural complex- 
ity provides an explanation of the difficulty of 
processing center embedding that makes much 
weaker commitment to the parsing model. Fig- 
ure 3 shows the lengths of the dependency links 
in a center-embedding sentence (la) and a non- 
center-embedding sentence (lb) with similar se- 
mantics. The structural complexity of the center- 
embedding sentence is 30, which is much higher 
than the structurM complexity (=112) of the non- 
center-embedding sentence. 
The presumption that human sentence pro- 
cessor uses a push-down sl;ack is challenged by 
the contrast between cross-serial dependencies in
Dutch (e.g., Figure 4a) and center-embedding sen- 
tences in German (e.g., Figm:e 4b.) 
Since the cross serial dependencies are much 
more ditficnlt to handle with push-down stacks

When a phrase is extraposed, the set of depen- 
dency relationships remains the same. However, 
the lengths of some of the dependency links will 
change. The structural complexity of the sentence 
may change as a result. Figure 6 illustrates how 
extrapositions atlhct the lengths of dependency 
links is, (3), (4), (5), and (6). Only the depen- 
dency links whose lengths are changed are shown 
there. In all cases, structural complexity is re- 
duced by the extraposition. 
Consider the difference between (7a) and (7b). 
In (7a), the extraposition of \ [pp with a mustache\] 
increases the length of the dependency link be- 
tween "man" and "with" by 1, but reduces the 
length of the dependency between "talked" and 
"yesterday" by 3. Therefore, the structural com- 
plexity is reduced by 2 as a result of the extrapo- 
sit,on. In contrast, in (Tb), the extraposition of 
\[pp with a mustache\] increases tile length of the 
dependency link between "man" and "with" by 6 
and reduces the length of the dependency link be- 
tween "talk" and "ago" by 3. Thus the structural 
complexity is increased when \[Pe with a mustache\] 
is extraposed. 
The hypothesis that extraposition must reduce 
the structural complexity also explains why in 
heavy-NP shift, the extraposed NP must be heavy, 
i.e., consisting of many words. When the comple- 
ment Nil ) of a verb is 'shifted' to the right across an 
adjunct modifier of the verb, the length of the de- 
pendency link from the verb to tile head of the NP 
is increased by length the adjunct modifier. On 
the other hand, the length of the dependency link 
fi'om the verb to the adjunct modifier is reduced 
by the length of the NP. Theretbre, the structural 
complexity of the sentence can only be reduced as 
a result of the extraposition when the NP is longer 
than the adjunct modifier,

5 L inear  P recedence  
In most languages, the NP modifiers of a word 
tend to be <;loser to the word than it, s PP rood,- 
tiers, which, in turn, tend to be closer to the word 
than its CP (clansal) modifiers. In GPSG (Gaz- 
dar et al, 1985), these lineal: order constraints are 
stated explicitly as the linear precedence rules. In 
this section, we show thai; the linear precedence 
rules in GPSG can be derived fl'om the assump- 
tion that the linear order among different types 
of modifying phrases, such as NP, PP, and CP, 
should minimize the structural complexity so that 
the sentence is as easy to process as possible. 
Suppose a word w has n modifiers XP:I, XP~, 
..., XP,  ; the number of words in XPi is li; mM the 
head word of XP i  is wi, which is the pi'th word 
in XPi. Without loss of generality, let us assume 
that w precedes its modifiers. \[f the order of the 
modifiers is XP1, XPu, ..., XP,;, then the length 
of the dependency link between w and the head 
of XPi is (Pi + 2j-:tl lj) and the total length of 
dependency links within tile maximal projection 
732 
of w is:

6 D iscuss ion  
We used the total length of the dci>endency links 
in the definition of structural complexil,y. The ex- 
amples ltresented in the previous sect, ions are also 
consistent w:ith a definition l;hat uses the inaxi- 
mum length of structural  links. The reasotL we 
choose to use the stnrt is that the definition natu- 
rally incorporate the length into consi<lcration.
