1 In t roduct ion  
Recognition of proper nouns in Japanese text has 
been studied as a part of the more general problem of 
morphological nalysis in Japanese text processing 
(\[1\] [2\]). It has also been studied in the framework of 
Japanese information extraction (\[3\]) in recent years. 
Our approach to the Multi-lingual Evaluation 
Task (MET) for Japanese text is to consider the 
given task as a morphological nalysis problem in 
Japanese. Our morphological nalyzer has done all 
the necessary work for the recognition and classi- 
fication of proper names, numerical and temporal 
expressions, i.e. Named Entity (NE) items in the 
Japanese text. 
The analyzer is called "Amorph". Amorph rec- 
ognizes NE items in two stages: dictionary lookup 
and rule application. First, it uses several kinds of 
dictionaries to segment and tag Japanese character 
strings. Second, based on the information resulting 
from the dictionary lookup stage, a set of rules is 
applied to the segmented strings in order to identify 
NE items. When a segment is found to be an NE 
item, this information is added to the segment and 
it is used to generate the final output 1. 
2 System Description 
2.1 System Overview 
The main processes in the Amorph system are as 
follows: 
1. A basic morphological nalysis is carried out 
on the input text using a simple dictionary. 
Part-of-speech information is added to the text. 
Since proper noun is not one of the parts of 
speech, all the nouns are tagged simply as noun. 
2. Three proper noun dictionaries (organization, 
person, location) are consulted for each noun in 
the text. If there is an exact match between a
noun in the text and an item in one of these 
dictionaries, the noun is tagged as such. 
3. A "co-occurrence" (kyoukigo) dictionary which 
is a collection of key words is consulted. These 
~Wakao is a visiting researcher at NEC Information 
Technology Research Labs in 1996 
key words are words which indicate that the seg- 
ment is a part of a Named Entity item, or the 
segment is immediately before or after an NE 
item. When such a key word is found, it is 
marked as such. 
4. A set of rules for each type of NE items (or- 
ganization, person, location, date, time, money, 
percent) is applied to the result so far. Some 
organization names are recorded temporarily in
the system to identify the names which appear 
somewhere else in the text (name learning). If 
a segment (or segments) is judged to be an NE 
item by some rule or name learning, then it is 
marked so. 
5. Finally the output generation module produces 
the final output, marking NE items in the text 
with the specified SGML markup. 
The use of dictionaries (or lists) of proper names 
and key words, and the application of rules based on 
the dictionary lookup have also been adopted in the 
Sheffield English MUC-6 system (\[4\]). 
Figure 1 shows the overview of the Amorph sys- 
tem illustrating how the input text is processed.

3 D ic t ionar ies  
The Amorph system uses three proper noun dictio- 
naries and a key word dictionary. Table 1 shows the 
size of the proper noun dictionaries. 
. the segments are a Kanji-, Katakana-, or 
alphabet-character-only string and followed by 
a specific expression such as " (~:~J:" (head- 
quarters), they are judged to be an organization 
name. 
Type Size 
Location 10438 
Organization 2544 
Person 8223 
Total 21205 
Table h Size of Proper Noun Dictionaries 
The key word dictionary has 785 items in total. 
For example, "$"  (city) is a key word for a location 
name, "gk :~"  (President) for a person name, and 
"~J:" (Company) for an organization ame. It has 
61 key words for location, 324 for organization, 351 
for person, and 49 for number and time expressions. 
Table 2 shows the sizes of key words for different 
types of the NE items.

4 Ext rac t ion  Ru les  
A set of rules is applied to the text after the dic- 
tionary lookup is done. These rules have been pro- 
duced manually in order to capture different ypes 
of proper names as well as number and temporal 
expressions in the text. 
The Japanese language has four different kinds 
of characters: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji (Chinese 
characters), and alphabetic haracters, besides nu- 
merical and punctuation symbols. Some of the rules 
below use this feature, i.e. what kind of characters 
the given string is made of. 
Here are some rules for person and organization 
names. 
1. if the segment is positioned immediately before 
or after a person key word, and it is marked as 
either location or ambiguous between location 
and person name, then it is recognized as per- 
sort. 
e.g. "~.~" :  "~"  (Chiba) is ambiguous be- 
tween location and person name, but since it is 
followed by a person key word, "~" (Mr. in 
this case), "~"  is recognized as person. 
e.g. "N E C (2g~J:~" (NEC, headquarters in 
Tokyo): "N E C" is an alphabet-character-only 
string and recognized as an organization name. 
5 Name learn ing  
When a segment (or a set of segments) is recognized 
as organization ame and at the same time it is an 
Mphabet-character-only or katakana-character-only 
string, the system records it temporarily and use it 
to recognize appearances of the name in other places 
in the text. 
For example, a katakana-character-only string, 
)~ ~ ~ ? ~ Y 7 (Mercedes Benz) is once recognized 
as organization ame, both segments ( .~)P~'~ 
and ~ 'Y )  are remembered as organization ame 
to capture later appearances of the name (.~ }1~ 
.7, in this case) in the text. 
This mechanism of learning names is useful for 
recognizing organization names in the headline since 
organization names tend to be in shortened forms in 
the headline and their full names appear in the body 
of the text.
