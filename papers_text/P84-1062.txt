ABSTRACT 
Cognitive principles underlying the (re-)construc- 
tion of word meaning and/or world knowledge struc- 
tures are poorly understood yet. In a rather sharp 
departure from more orthodox lines of introspective 
acquisition of structural data on meaning and know- 
ledge representation in cognitive science, an empi- 
r ical  approach is explored that analyses natural 
language data s ta t i s t i ca l l y ,  represents i ts  numeri- 
cal findings fuzzy-set theoretical ly,  and inter-  
pret5 i ts  intermediate constructs (stereotype mean- 
ing points) topologically as elements of semantic 
space. As connotative meaning representations, 
these elements allow an aspect-controlled, con- 
tents-driven algorithm to operate which reorganizes 
them dynamically in dispositional dependency struc- 
tures (DDS-trees) which constitute a procedurally 
defined meaning representation format. 
O. Introduction 
Modelling system structures of word meanings and/or 
world knowledge is to face the problem of their 
mutual and complex relatedness. As the cognitive 
principles underlying these structures are poorly 
understood yet, the work of psychologists, AI-re- 
searchers, and linguists active in that f ie ld ap- 
pears to be determined by the respective disci-  
pllne's general line of approach rather than by 
consequences drawn from these approaches' intersec- 
ting results in their common f ie ld of interest. In 
l inguist ic semantics, cognitive psychology, and 
knowledge representation most of the necessary data 
concerning lexical ,  semantic and/or external world 
information is s t i l l  provided introspectively. Be- 
searchers are exploring (or make test-persons ex- 
plore) their own l inguist ic/cognit ive capacities 
and memory structures to depict their findings (or 
let hypotheses about them be tested) in various 
representational formats ( l i s ts .  arrays, trees, 
nets, active networks, etc.) .  I t  is widely accepted 
that these modelstructures do have a more or less 
ad hoc character and tend to be confined to their 
limited theoretical or operational performances 
within a specified approach, subject domain or im- 
plemented system. Basically interpretative approa- 
ches like these, however, lack the most salient 
characteristics of more constructive modelstruc- 
tures that can be developed along the lines of an 
entity-re!stlonshio approach (CHEN 1980). Their 
properties of f lex ib i l i ty  and dynamics are needed 
for automatic meaning representation f rom input 
texts to build up and/or modify the realm and scope 
of their own knowledge, however baseline and vague 
that may appear compared to human understanding. 
In a rather sharp departure from those more ortho- 
dox lines of introspective data acquisition in mea- 
ning and knowledge representation research, the 
present approach (I) has been based on the algo- 
rithmic analysis of discourse that real speakers/ 
writers produce in actual situations of performed 
or intended communication on a certain subject do- 
main, and (2) the approach makes essential use of 
the word-usage/entity-relationship paradigm in com- 
bination with procedural means to map fuzzy word 
meanings and their connotative interrelat ions in a 
format of stereotypes. Their dynamic dependencies 
(3) constitute semantic dispositions that render 
only those conceptual interrelations accessible to 
automatic processing which can - under di f fer ing 
aspects d i f ferent ly  - be considered relevant. Such 
dispositional dependency structures (DDS) would 
seem to be an operational prerequisite to and a 
promising candidate for the simulation of contents- 
driven (analogically-associative), instead of for- 
mal ( logically-deductive) inferences in semantic 
processing. 
I .  The approach 
The empirical analysis of discourse and the formal 
representation of vague word meanings in natural 
language texts as a system of interrelated concepts 
(RIEGER 1980) is based on a WITTGENSTEINian assump- 
tion according to which a great number of texts 
analysed for any of the employed terms' usage regu- 
larztie~ wil l  reveal essential parts of the con- 
cepts and hence the meanings conveyed. 
I t  has been shown elsewhere (RIEGER 1980), that in 
a suf f ic ient ly  large sample of pragmatically homo- 
geneous texts,cal led corpus, only a restricted vo- 
cabulary, i .e .  a limited number of lexical items 
wil l  be used by the interlocutors however compre- 
hensive their personal vocabularies in general 
might be. Consequently, the lexical items employed 
to convey information on a certain subject domain 
under consideration in the discourse concerned wi l l  
be distributed according to their conventionalized 
communicative properties, constituting semantic re- 
gu!ar i t iez which may be detected empirically from 
the texts. 
For the quantitative analysis not of propositional 
strings but of their elements, namely words in na- 
tural language texts, rather simple s tat i s t ics  ser- 
ve the basicalkly descriptive purpose. Developed 
from and centred around a correlational measure to 
specify intensit ies of co-occurring lexical items 
used in natural language discourse, these analysing 
298 
algorithms allow for the systematic modelling of a 
fragment of the lexical structure constituted by 
the vocabulary employed in the texts as part of the 
concomitantly conveyed world knowledge. 
A correlation coeff ic ient appropriately modified 
for the purpose has been used as a mapping function 
(RIEGER 1981a). I t  allows to compute the relat ional 
interdependency of any two lexical items from their  
textual frequencies. Those items which co-occur 
frequently in a number of texts wil l  posit ively be 
correlated and hence called affined, those of which 
only one (and not the other) frequently occurs in a 
number of texts wi l l  negatively be correlated and 
hence called repugnant. Different degrees of word- 
repugnancy and word-affinity may thus be ascer- 
tained without recurring to an investigator's or 
his test-persons' word and/or world knowledge (se- 
mantic competence), but can instead solely be based 
upon the usage regularit ies of lexical items obser- 
ved in a corpus of pragmatically homogeneous texts,  
spoken or written by real speakers~hearers in ac- 
tual or intended acts of communication (communica- 
tive performance). 
2. The semantic space structure 
Following a system-theoretic approach and taking 
each word employed as a potential descriptor to 
characterize any other word's virtual meaning, the 
modified correlation coeff icient can be used to map 
each lexical item into fuzzy subsets (ZADEH 1981) 
of the vocabulary according to i ts  numerically spe- 
cif ied usage regularit ies.  Measuring the differen- 
ces of any one's lexical item's usages, represented 
as fuzzy subsets of the vocabulary, against those 
of al l  others allows for a consecutive mapping of 
items onto another abstract entity of the theoret i -  
cal construct. These new operationally defined en- 
t i t ies  - called an item's meanings - may verbally 
be characterized as a function of a l l  the d i f fe -  
rences of al l  regular i t ies any one item is used 
with compared to any other item in the same corpus 
of discourse.

Table I:  Topological environment E<UNTERNEHM> 
The resulting system of sets of fuzzy subsets con- 
st i tutes the semantic space. As a distance-relatio- 
nal datastructure of stereotypically formatted mea- 
ning representations i t  may be interpreted topo- 
logical ly as a hyperspace with a natural metric. 
I ts  l inguist ica l ly  labelled elements represent mea- 
ning points, and their mutual distances represent 
meaning differences. 
The position of a meaning point may be described by 
i ts  semantic environment. Tab.1 shows the topologi- 
cal envlronment E<UNTNEHM>, i .e.  those adjacent 
points being situated within the hypersphere of a 
certain diameter around i ts  center meaning point 
UNTERNEHM/enterprise as computed from a corpus of 
German newspaper texts comprising some 8000 tokens 
of 360 types in 175 texts from the 1964 editions of 
the daily DIE WELT. 
Having checked a great number of environments, %t 
was ascertained that they do in fact assemble mea- 
ning points of a certain semantic a f f in i ty .  Further 
investigation revealed (RIEGER 1983) that there are 
regions of higher point density in the semantic 
space, forming clouds and clusters. These were de- 
tected by multivariate and cluster-analyzing me- 
thods which showed, however, that the both, para- 
digmatically and syntagmatically, related items 
formed what may be named connotatlve clouds rather 
than what is known to be called semantic f le!ds.  
Although i ts  internal relations appeared to be un- 
specifiable in terms of any logical ly deductive or 
concept hierarchical system, their elements' posi- 
tions showed high degree of stable structures which 
suggested a regular form of contents-dependant as- 
sociative connectedness (RIEGER 19Bib). 
3. The dispositional dependency 
Following a more semiotic understanding of meaning 
constitution, the present semantic space model may 
become part of a word meaning/world knowledge re- 
presentation system which separates the format of a 
basic (stereotype) meaning representation from i ts  
latent (dependency) relational organization. Where- 
as the former is a rather s tat ic ,  topologically 
structured (associative) memory representing the 
data that text analysing algorithms provide, the 
lat ter  can be characterized as a collection of dy- 
namic and f lex ib le  structuring processes to re- 
organize these data under various principles (RIE- 
6ER 1981b). Other than declarative knowledge that 
can be represented in pre-defined semantic network 
structures, meaning relations of lexical relevance 
and semantic dispositlons which are haevlly depen- 
dent on context and domain of knowledge concerned 
wi l l  more adequately be defined procedurally, i .e .  
by generative algorithms that induce them on chang- 
ing data only and whenever necessary. This is 
achieved by a recursively defined procedure that 
produces hierarchies of meaning points, structured 
under given aspects according to and in dependence 
of their meanings' relevancy (RIEGER 1984b). 
Corroborating ideas expressed within the theories 
spreading activation and the process of priming 
studied in cognitive psychology (LORCH 1982), a new 
algorithm has been developed which operates on the 
semantic space data and generates - other than in 
RIEGER (1982) - dispositional dependency structures 
(DDS) in the format of n-ary trees. Given one mean- 
ing point's position as a star t ,  the algorithm of 
least distances (LD) w~ll f i r s t  l i s t  a l l  i t s  neigh- 
bouring points and stack them by increasing distan- 
ces, second prime the starting point as head node 
or root of the DDS-tree to be generated before, 
third, the algorithm's generic procedure takes 
over. I t  wi l l  take the f i r s t  entry from the stack, 
generate a l i s t  of i t s  neighbours, determine from 
i t  the least distant one that has already been 
primed, and identi fy i t  as the ancestor-node to 
299 
whlcn the new point is linked as descendant-node to 
be primed next. Repeated succesively for each of 
the meaning polnts stacked and in turn primed in 
accordance with this procedure, the algorithm wil l  
select a particular fragment of the relat ional 
structure latent lv  inherent in the semantic space 
data and depending on the aspect, i .e .  the in i t ia l -  
ly primed meaning point the algorithm is started 
with. Working i ts  way through and consuming al l  
lapeled points in the space structure - unless 
stopped under conditions of given target nodes, 
number of nodes to be processed, or threshold of 
maximum distance - the algorithm transforms pre- 
vai l ing s imi lar i t ies  of meanings as represented by 
adjacent points to establish a binary, non-symme- 
t r i c ,  and t rans i t ive relation of semantic relevance 
between them. This relation allows for the hierar- 
chical re-organization of meaning points as nodes 
under a pr,med head in an n-arv DDS-tree (RIEGER 
1984a). 
Without introducing the algorithms formally, some 
of their operatlve characteristics can well be i l -  
lustrated in the sequel by a few simplif ied examp- 
les. Beginning with the schema of a distance-l ike 
data structure as shown in the two-dimensional con- 
f iguration of 11 points, labeled a to k (Fig. I . I}  
the stimulation of e.g. points a or c wi l l  start 
the procedure and produce two specific selections 
of distances activated among these 11 points (Fig. 
1.2). The order of how these part icular distances 
are selected can be represented either by step- 
l i s t s  (Fig. 1.3), or n-ary tree-structures (Fig. 
1.41, or their binary transformations {Fig. 1.5). 
I t  is apparent that stimulation of other points 
within the same configuration of basic data points 
wi l l  result in similar but nevertheless d i f fer ing 
trees, depending on the aspect under which the 
structure is accessed, i .e .  the point in i t la l l y  
stimulated to start the algorithm wlth. 
Applied to the semantic space data of 360 defined 
meaning points calculated from the textcorpus of 
the t964 editions of the German newspaper DIE WELT, 
the Dispositional Dependency Structure ?DDS) of 
UNTERNEHMlenterprise is given in Fig. 2 as gene- 
rated by the procedure described. 
Beside giving distances between nodes in the DDS- 
tree, a numerlcal measure has been devised which 
describes any node's degree of relevance according 
to that tree structure. As a numerical measure, a 
node's crzterial ity is to be calculated with re- 
spect to i ts  root or aspect and has been defined as 
a function of both, i ts  distance values and i ts  
level tn the tree concerned. For a w~de range of 
purposes ~n processing DDS-trees, d i f ferent c r l te -  
r ia l i t ies  of nodes can be used to estimate which 
paths are more l ike ly  being taken against others 
being followed less l i ke ly  under priming of certain 
meanlng points. Source-orlented, contents-drlven 
search  and ra t t le rs !  procedures  may thus be per for -  
med ef fect ive ly  on the semantlc space structure, 
allowing for the actlvatlon of depeneency paths. 
These are to trace those intermediate nodes which 
determine the associative transit ions of any target 
node under any specifiable aspect.
