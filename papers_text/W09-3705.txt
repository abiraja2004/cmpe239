Computing Genitive Superlatives
Johan Bos

Superlative expressions (such as ?the tallest boy?) single out en-
tities by comparing them to others with respect to a set of prop-
erties. Therefore, a proper semantics for a superlative expression
requires a correct computation of the comparison set. In most
of the cases, this can be done in a compositional fashion (leaving
contextual influences aside). When superlative adjectives occur
in prenominal genitive constructions (such as ?his most expen-
sive car?, this isn?t so straightforward anymore. Three solutions
are proposed, that all change the underlying syntactic structure
of the genitive construction in order to arrive at a correct com-
parison set. The solution where ordinary nouns are analysed
?relationally? is preferred, because it requires the least num-
ber of modifications of the grammar. Under certain conditions,
superlatives also exhibit so-called comparative readings (as op-
posed to absolute readings). With the current machinery it is
however impossible to account for such readings in a composi-
tional way.
1 Introduction
The superlative construction singles out entities as having some property to
the greatest (or smallest) degree. In English, superlative adjectives are nor-
mally preceeded by the definite article or a possessive; one-syllable adjectives
and some two-syllable adjectives end in -est, some words of two syllables and
all words of three or more syllables are preceeded most (or least). Here are
some examples (superlatives underlined):
(1) ... the tallest boy ...
(2) ... AS Roma?s quickest player ...
18
(3) ... the Big Board?s most respected floor traders ...
An adequate semantics of the superlative construction presupposes a proper
comparison set ? the entities that are compared. In this paper we discuss
the interaction between superlative adjectives and genitive constructions
and their effect on the construction of the comparison set. We argue that
the mainstream analysis of superlatives in prenominal genitive expressions
is troublesome.
We provide the various syntactic analyses in Combinatory Categorial
Grammar (CCG, [Ste01]) with Discourse Representation Theory [KR93]
functioning as model-theoretical framework. We demonstrate the syntax-
semantics interface for a sentence with simple superlative adjective in Sec-
tion 2 and then show why possessives complicate the formation of a correct
comparison set in Section 3. We discuss so-called comparative readings in
Section 4 and show what role the genitive plays in blocking certain interpre-
tations.
2 Superlatives and the Syntax-Semantics Interface
It is well known that superlatives can be analysed in terms of comparative
constructions [Wal72]. Accordingly, ?the R-est X? denotes an X such that
there is no Y different from X that is R-er. This is also the approach we will
follow in our theory of superlatives, in which we use CCG (Combinatory
Categorial Grammar, [Ste01]) to provide us with a syntactic analysis, and
DRT (Discourse Representation Theory, [KR93]) to produce semantically
interpretable structures.
In what follows we will illustrate the formalism with an example. We
will give a CCG derivation and introduce some of the relevant terminology.
Then we will show how the syntax-semantics interface works by composi-
tionally constructing a semantic representation for a sentence containing a
superlative.
The version of CCG that we use in the context of this article comprises
four atomic categories (s, np, n, pp), functor categories such as np/n (de-
terminer) and (s\np)/np (transitive verb) and the combinatory rules [fa]
(forward application), [fc] (forward composition), and [ba] (backward ap-
plication). We indicate lexical categories by [lex] in derivations. Note that
slashes indicate directionality: X/Y denotes a functor category looking for
an argument of category Y on its right, yielding category X; X\Y is a func-
tor category looking for an argument Y on its left. Now consider a basic
19
example of a sentence with a simple superlative adjective, and its analysis
in CCG:
tallest boy
------[lex] ---[lex]
the n/n n
---[lex] -----------------[fa]
saw np/n n
---------[lex] ---------------------------[fa]
I (s\np)/np np
--[lex] -------------------------------------------[fa]
np s\np
----------------------------------------------------[ba]
s
On the basis of the syntactic structure that CCG gives us we can build a
semantic representation in a bottom-up fashion. We do so by employing a
version of lambda-DRT [Mus96, vEK97]: all lexical entries are associated
with lambda-DRSs. The number of abstracted variables mirrors the syntac-
tic type of the CCG category.
1
The derivation given above tells us that we combine ?tallest? and ?boy?
first, under guidance of the [fa] rule. Consider first the lambda-DRS for
each of these words separately (we use the ; operator to indicate a merge
(signifying dynamic conjunction) between DRS, and we take the @ symbol
to mean function application):
?tallest?
CAT: n/n
DRS: ?P.?x.(P@x;
(
y
y6=x
;P@y)?
taller(x,y)
)
?boy?
CAT: n
DRS: ?u.
boy(u)
The superlative introduces a complex condition, stating that whatever entity
is selected with property P, it is taller than all other entities with property P.
We simply assume that superlatives introduce a two-place ordering relation,
a relation which can be characterised as asymmetric and transitive.
2
In our
example ?tallest? introduces taller(x,y), a relation that orders entities in
the domain with respect to their size. (It is a transitive relation, because
1
In terms of Van Eijck and Kamp?s semantic type system [vEK97], with the basic
types e for entities and T for state transitions, the category s corresponds to T , n and pp
correspond to ?e, T ?, and np to ??e, T ?, T ?. So there is strict type-transparancy between
the syntactic types of CCG and the semantic types of lambda-DRT expressions.
2
A bad semantics, in Van Benthem?s view [vB83], because it wouldn?t explain and only
describe the behaviour of comparatives. That might be true from a philosophical point of
view ? from a computational semantics perspective it is quite practical.
20
if X is taller than Y, and Y is taller than Z, then X is taller than Z; it is
asymmetric, because if X is taller than Y, then it is not the case that Y is
taller than X.)
Going back to our example, the interpretation of the [fa] rule tells
us that the lambda-DRS of the functor category should be applied to the
lambda-DRS of the argument category. So we get this as intermediate result:
?tallest boy?
CAT: n
DRS: ?P.?x.(P@x;
(
y
y 6=x
;P@y)?
taller(x,y)
) @ ?u.
boy(u)
If we carry out the substitutions (for the lambda-bound variable P) in the
process of ?-conversion we obtain the following lambda-DRS:
?tallest boy?
CAT: n
DRS: ?x.(?u.
boy(u)
@x;
(
y
y 6=x
;?u.
boy(u)
@y)?
taller(x,y)
)
Once more we can perform ?-conversion (for the lambda-bound inner vari-
ables u) yielding the following lambda-DRS:
?tallest boy?
CAT: n
DRS: ?x.(
boy(x)
;
(
y
y6=x
;
boy(y)
)?
taller(x,y)
)
Finally we can carry out merge-reduction (the process of joining two DRSs
into one, by taking the unions of the discourse referents and the conditions,
respectively) and arrive at a DRS which meaning can be glossed as ?the
boy which is taller than every other boy?. In this example, the comparison
set of the superlative expression is just the set of boys. Its semantic scope
is established in the antecedent of the DRS conditional introduced by the
lexical semantics of the superlative.
3 Superlatives in Genitive Constructions
3.1 The Problem
As shown in the previous section, the analysis given to a superlative ad-
jectives seems to be satisfactory: it can be done in a compositional way,
and it yields the desired interpretation. However, as noted in [BN06], this
21
analysis does not easily carry over to superlative expressions that combine
with prenominal genitive expressions (constructions marked by the clitic -
?s or possessive pronouns), such as ?AS Roma?s fastest player?, ?his least
expected answer?, and ?London?s most expensive restaurant?. Why is this
the case?
Let?s consider the comparison set of AS Roma?s fastest player, which is
not just a set of players, but the set of players from AS Roma. It seems
here that the superlative adjective out-scopes the possessive noun phrase.
But this is not the effect that we get if we follow the standard analysis in a
categorial grammar [Ste01, Hoc03, Car97]:
AS Roma ?s fastest player
-------[lex] ---------[lex] -------[lex] -----[lex]
np (np/n)\np n/n n
------------------------[ba] --------------------[fa]
saw np/n n
---------[lex] --------------------------------------------------[fa]
I (s\np)/np np
--[lex] -----------------------------------------------------------------[fa]
np s\np
--------------------------------------------------------------------------[ba]
s
It is not difficult to see why. Once we?ve analysed the sub-phrase ?fastest
player?, we?ve basically fixed the scope of the comparison set in the lambda-
DRS. The antecedent DRS of the implicational condition, representing the
comparison set, is completed, and there is nothing we can do about it any-
more ? unless you?re in for some ad-hoc post-processing activities. We
argue that the syntactic analysis for phrases such as the above is insufficient
to get a correct semantic analysis, and therefore any compositional solution
will involve work at the level of the syntax-semantics interface.
3.2 Possible Solutions
Within the framework of CCG, we present three ways to change the analysis
to reach a proper treatment of prenominal genitives that interact with su-
perlatives. The first is Bos & Nissim?s solution to the problem [BN06]. The
second and third are inspired by work of Partee and Carpenter, respectively,
who introduce different interpretations for the genitive to account for the
ambiguities that appear with inherently relational nouns ? solutions that
also seem to work well for our problem with genitive superlatives.
22
3.2.1 Proposal I: Bos & Nissim 2006
Bos & Nissim note the problem only manifests itself with prenominal geni-
tives [BN06]. To fix it, they add a new syntactic (and semantic) type for the
prenominal possessive. A way of doing this is to recognise phrases such as
?his most expensive? and ?AS Roma?s fastest? as determiner-like phrases,
with CCG category np/n. Under this view, let?s consider our problematic
case again.
AS Roma ?s
-------[lex] -----------------[lex]
np ((np/n)/(n/n))\np fastest
--------------------------------[ba] ----[lex]
(np/n)/(n/n) n/n player
-------------------------------------------[fa] ------[lex]
np/n n
--------------------------------------------------------[fa]
np
Now consider the lambda-DRSs for the different lexical items in this exam-
ple. The only new category is the one for the clitic -?s, which is given the
following lexical semantics:
??s?
CAT: ((np/n)/(n/n))\np
DRS: ?N.?S.?P.?Q.(
u
;(((S@?x.(P@x;N@?y.
of(x,y)
))@u);Q@u))
That is, the lambda-DRS for the possessive takes three arguments: the noun
phrase, a superlative adjective, and a noun. This results in a representation
for ?AS Roma?s fastest player? shown as the lambda-DRS in (4).
(4)
?AS Roma?s fastest player?
CAT: np
DRS: ?Q.(
x u
player(x) of(x,u) AS-Roma(u)
y
player(y) of(y,u)
x 6=y
?
faster(x,y)
;Q@x)
This analysis yields the desired comparison set: we quantify over ?players
of AS Roma?, not just ?players?. But arguably, the solution involves over-
loading the possessive construction with a new CCG category that only is
used in superlative constructions, lacking independent motivation. So let?s
look at an alternative.
23
3.2.2 Proposal II: Partee 1997
An alternative way of computing the comparison set for superlatives in
genitive expressions builds on Partee?s analysis for relational nouns [Par97,
PB99]. Partee enriches the syntax by including a ?transitive common noun
phrase?, along the usual common noun phrases. As a result she also dis-
tinguishes between two types of determiner in the genitive: one that selects
transitive nouns, and one that selects ordinary nouns. Semantically, the
former receives an inherently relational interpretation (expressed by a two-
place relation), and the latter a free interpretation, filled in by the context.
We argue that almost any noun can be interpreted ?relationally? when
it is part of a genitive. By making the noun relational, we can leave the
creation of the comparison set to the clitic -?s, by giving it a category that
subcategorises for a relational noun. This ensures that all relevant material
enters the comparison set, as we will see in the example below.
In order to achieve this, we introduce a new basic CCG category tn
(transitive noun, Partee?s TCN) and an additional category tn/tn for su-
perlative adjectives. As in Partee?s grammar, we introduce an additional
category for the clitic -?s as well. Hence, superlative adjectives can be as-
signed two categories: n/n if they modify non-relational nouns, and tn/tn
if they modify relational nouns. This gives us the following Partee-style
analysis for AS Roma?s fastest player:
AS Roma ?s fastest player
-------[lex] ----------[lex] -------[lex] ------[lex]
np (np/tn)\np tn/tn tn
-------------------------[ba] ---------------------[fa]
np/tn tn
----------------------------------------------------[fa]
np
Since we have several new CCG categories here, we need to propose
corresponding lambda-DRSs too. (We assign the syntactic category tn the
semantic type ?e, ?e, T ??.)
??s?
CAT: (np/tn)\np
DRS: ?N.?R.?P.(N@?x.(
y
;(R@y)@x;P@y))
?fastest?
CAT: tn/tn
DRS: ?R.?x.?y.(
(
z
z 6=x
;(R@z)@y)?
faster(x,z)
;(R@x)@y)
24
?player?
CAT: tn
DRS: ?x.?y.
player(x,y)
The lambda-DRS that will result from the derivation given above is tanta-
mount to the one presented in (4). So this proposal computes the correct
comparison set, but at the cost of introducing a new atomic CCG category.
Could we have avoided this?
3.2.3 Proposal III: Carpenter 1997
The third propopal resembles the second, but it doesn?t introduce new basic
CCG categories. It adopts the idea of Partee to distinguish nouns from rela-
tional nouns, but instead of giving it a new basic category, we give it the func-
tor category n/pp, inspired by Carpenter [Car97], who introduced a second
lexical category for the possessive that ?consumes a nominal complement
that itself seeks a complement?. In Carpenter?s type-logical framework this
interpretation of the possessive receives the category np\(np/(n/np:of)).
Translated into CCG we get the following CCG derivation for our running
example:
AS Roma ?s fastest player
-------[lex] --------------[lex] ------------[lex] -----[lex]
np (np/(n/pp))\np (n/pp)/(n/pp) n/pp
-----------------------------[ba] -------------------------[fa]
np/(n/pp) n/pp
------------------------------------------------------------[fa]
np
There are no new basic CCG categories (the category pp is used inde-
pendently in CCG for prepositional complements [Ste01]), but the structure
of the derivation is identical to that of Proposal II. Semantically, however, it
is slightly different, and in a way closer to Proposal I, because the possessive
relation is introduced by the clitic -?s and not by the relational noun:
??s?
CAT: (np/(n/pp))\np
DRS: ?N.?R.?P.(
z
;(R@?x.(N@?y.
of(y,z)
))@z;P@z)
?fastest?
CAT: (n/pp)/(n/pp)
DRS: ?R.?P.?x.(
(
y
y 6=x
;(R@P)@y)?
faster(x,y)
;(R@P)@x)
?player?
CAT: n/pp
DRS: ?P.?x.(
player(x)
;P@x)
25
3.3 Evaluation
Which proposal is better? The first proposal changes the structure of the
derivation for basic superlatives as given in the previous section, but doesn?t
introduce new basic categories. The second and third proposal have the
same syntactic structure as the original CCG analysis; but the former does
so at the cost of introducing a new basic CCG category. Arguably, the third
proposal has a more intuitive semantics. In sum, Proposal III seems the best
choice for analysing superlatives in possessive constructions. As an added
bonus, a reformulation of the postnominal genitive construction will yield a
semantic representation tantamount to the prenominal one:
of AS Roma
-----[lex] -------[lex]
the fastest player pp/np np
----[lex] ----------[lex] ------[lex] --------------------[fa]
np/n n/n n/pp pp
----------------------[fc] ---------------------------------[fa]
np/n n
-------------------------------------------------------------[fa]
np
Furthermore, under Proposal II and III one could argue that the prenom-
inal genitive always subcategorises for a relational noun, independently from
the presence of superlatives. This would result in only one syntactic cate-
gory for the clitic -?s, rather than the two categories we need to distinguish
between relational and non-relational nouns.
Finally, we are well aware that analysing the possessive relation for a
noun N as ?N(x) & of(x,y)?, as in Proposal I and III, is problematic for
various reasons. First of all, it doesn?t explain what kind of relation there
is between the two entities. Secondly, it will give sometimes the wrong pre-
dictions; we would wrongly predict that ?Vincent?s boss is Mia?s husband?
entails that Mia?s boss is Vincent?s husband!
3
It is a problem independent
from the objectives of the paper. A solution would be to analyse phrase
such as ?husband of Mia? as ?x.[person(x) & ?y(role(x,y) & husband(y) &
of(y,mia))], paraphrased as the ?person who is playing the role of Mia?s hus-
band?. However in the context of this paper we will analyse the possessive
using the simplified (but semantically inadequate) analysis.

This was kindly pointed out to me by Steve Pulman, Yuliya Lierler, Vladimir Lifschitz
and anonymous reviewers.

4 Comparative Readings
An interesting behaviour of superlative expressions is their capacity to invoke
so-called comparative readings, at least under certain conditions. As the
examples and discussion in this section demonstrate, this is a complex issue
and we don?t have a computational analysis to offer. Nevertheless we do
make some interesting new observations and present some fresh data.
4.1 Comparative Readings and the Genitive
There are other linguistic means to restrict the comparision set of superla-
tive expressions, as is well known from the formal semantics literature on
superlatives [Hei99, Sza86, Gaw95, FK00]. Consider the following examples:
(5) Callum climbed the highest mountain.
(6) Who climbed the highest mountain?
It has been observed that (5) and (6) have two distinct interpretations:
an absolute reading and a comparative one. The absolute reading of (5)
is where Callum climbed a mountain higher than any other mountain (i.e.
the highest mountain in the domain). The comparative reading describes a
situation where Callum climbed a higher mountain than anyone else climbed
(but not necessarily the highest mountain in the context).
The comparative reading is not always available, and even when it is,
the absolute reading seems to be the preferred one. Hence, an issue of
importance is to know under what linguistic conditions the comparative
reading is licensed. As has been pointed out by [Sza86], the comparative
reading requires association with focus (5) or a wh-question (6). A further
observation is that a superlative expression such as ?the highest mountain?
has a definite interpretation giving rise to the absolute reading, or can be
understood indefinitely, in which (5) can be paraphrased as ?Callum climbed
a mountain higher than anyone else climbed? [Sza86]. We note that this view
correctly predicts that the comparative reading is not available when the
superlative is part of a genitive construction (which are usually intrinsically
definite), as in (7) and (8):
(7) Callum climbed Scotland?s highest mountain.
(8) Callum climbed the highest mountain of Scotland.
27
There are, by and large, two different proposals to account for the com-
parative reading in superlative noun phrases: the movement theory, and the
in-situ theory. Neither of them is easy to implement. Following the move-
ment theory of superlative interpretation, the superlative quantifier -est can
move out of its noun phrase to a higher position in the sentence, and then
associates with focus to build the comparison set [Hei99, Sza86]. The in-situ
theory of superlatives [Hei99, FK00, Mat05] accounts for the comparative
interpretation by treating the superlative as a quantifier that is contextually
restricted.
As CCG is a lexicalised theory of grammar, it is natural to adopt an
in-situ approach. Let?s assume that nouns can either get the non-relational,
?free?, interpretation (via the category n) or the relational interpretation
(n/pp) as in Proposal III. The latter category will always give rise to the
absolute reading, explaining the absence of the comparative reading in (7)
and (8), because genitive contexts trigger the n/pp interpretation for nouns.
4.2 Comparative Readings and Relational Nouns
The transitive verb ?to have? shows peculiar behaviour with inherently re-
lational noun phrases as object [Par97]. It seems to be able to take bare
relational noun phrases as argument, unlike other transitive verbs. It also
blocks noun phrase objects where relational nouns are part of a genitive.
Consider the following contrasting cases (stars indicate non-grammatical
sentences):
(9) John has a sister.
(10) ? John has his sister.
(11) John has the smartest sister.
(12) ? John has his smartest sister.
(13) ? John has the smartest sister of Bill.
(14) ? John has Bill?s smartest sister.
Intriguingly, the only possible reading of (11) is the comparative one: for
some people with sisters, John is is the one that has a sister smarter than
every other person with a sister. There is no absolute reading in which ?the
smartest sister? has a definite interpretation.
28
Partee wonders whether ?to have? has a second possible interpretation
besides the transitive verb reading. In terms of CCG, this verb would receive
the category (s\np)/(np/pp) in addition to (s\np)/np. Assuming that
this would be the case, it would be possible to come up with a semantics
for ?have? that would yield the desired interpretation for (11). It would be
something like:
?R.?N.(N@?x.((R@?y.
x
of(y,x)
)@?y.
have(x,y)
))
However, other examples prove that this would not be sufficient:
(15) What city in Africa has the greatest population?
(16) What golf course has the highest slope rating?
(17) What cities have the worst automobile traffic?
In (15), for example, the members of the comparison set are populations of
African cities, not populations in general. Similarly, in (16) we talk about
slope ratings of golf courses, not of, say, amplifiers or agricultural vehicles;
in (17) finally, the comparison set contains traffic in cities, not in countries
or regions.
Given that this information is all provided within the sentence, one would
expect the compositional semantics to take care of that. However, it is un-
clear how the in-situ theory would get a correct interpretation of the su-
perlatives using a compositional semantics. We leave it as an open problem.
4.3 Comparative Readings and Most
The availability of the absolute and relative reading is not a phenomenon
that manifests itself only with superlative adjectives. A very similar effect
can be seen with the generalised quantifier most. Consider (18) and (19):
(18) Gloria sold most cars.
(19) Most babies are born in March.
Example (18) has besides the absolute reading (for instance, in a situation
with twenty cars, and Gloria sold more than ten of them), also a comparative
reading (for example, in a situation with twenty cars, where Gloria sold five,
Kenny three, and James four). A similar story can be told for (19): the
29
absolute reading, could be glossed as ?more babies are born March than in all
other months together?, which doesn?t make much sense. The comparative
reading, where the number of babies born in each month are compared, is
preferred here.
These are interesting examples, as a standard generalised quantifier se-
mantics for ?most?, meaning ?more than half?, would not suffice to get a
correct interpretation for (18) and (19). Again, we obviously don?t have a
solution for dealing with this problem, but there is a clear correspondence
of behaviour with that of the superlative adjective.
5 Discussion
It is perhaps surprising that none of the available theories of superlatives
([Hei99, Sza86, Gaw95, FK00]) say anything on how the genitive should
be integrated in a theory of superlatives, at least as far as the absolute
reading is concerned. Given this, it is perhaps not so sursprising, that
most of the currently existing computational grammars for English do not
have a correct treatment of this phenomenon. This does not only hold for
the CCG grammar on which this work was inspired [Hoc03], but also for
other well-known wide-coverage parsers and grammars. Analysing nouns
as ?relational? in genitive constructions would solve as least part of the
problem.
A correct semantic analysis of comparative readings requires further
work: we still know little under which conditions such readings are present
? a thorough corpus study might give inspiration and shine new light on
the matter. In addition, various other problems triggered by the superlative
are not dealt with in this paper. One is the interpretation of plural entities
in superlative expressions and interaction with ordinals. Another issue con-
cerns over-generation of the categorial grammar that we use. The current
analysis incorrectly supports extra-grammatical expressions such as ?the tall
fastest player?, which would be of particular importance for generation tasks
[vD06].
