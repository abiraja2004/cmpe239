Abstract
Several hybrid disambiguation methods are
described which combine the strength of
hand-written disambiguation rules and sta-
tistical taggers. Three different statistical
(HMM, Maximum-Entropy and Averaged
Perceptron) taggers are used in a tagging
experiment using Prague Dependency Tree-
bank. The results of the hybrid systems are
better than any other method tried for Czech
tagging so far.
1 Introduction
Inflective languages pose a specific problem in tag-
ging due to two phenomena: highly inflective na-
ture (causing sparse data problem in any statistically
based system), and free word order (causing fixed-
context systems, such as n-gram HMMs, to be even
less adequate than for English).
The average tagset contains about 1,000 ? 2,000
distinct tags; the size of the set of possible and plau-
sible tags can reach several thousands. There have
been attempts at solving this problem for some of
the highly inflective European languages, such as
(Daelemans, 1996), (Erjavec, 1999) for Slovenian
and (Hajic?, 2000) for five Central and Eastern Euro-
pean languages.
Several taggers already exist for Czech, e.g.
(Hajic? et al, 2001b), (Smith, 2005), (Hajic? et al,
2006) and (Votrubec, 2006). The last one reaches
the best accuracy for Czech so far (95.12 %). Hence
no system has reached ? in the absolute terms ? a
performance comparable to English tagging (such as
(Ratnaparkhi, 1996)), which stands above 97 %.
We are using the Prague Dependency Treebank
(Hajic? et al, 2006) (PDT) with about 1.8 million
hand annotated tokens of Czech for training and test-
ing. The tagging experiments in this paper all use
the Czech morphological (pre)processor, which in-
cludes a guesser for ?unknown? tokens and which is
available from the PDT website (PDT Guide, 2006)
to disambiguate only among those tags which are
morphologically plausible.
The meaning of the Czech tags (each tag has 15
positions) we are using is explained in Table 1. The
detailed linguistic description of the individual posi-
tions can be found in the documentation to the PDT
(Hajic? et al, 2006).

2 Components of the hybrid system
2.1 The HMM tagger
The HMM tagger is based on the well known for-
mula of HMM tagging:
T? = arg max
T
P (T )P (W | T ) (1)
where
P (W |T ) ?
?n
i=1 P (wi | ti, ti?1)
P (T ) ?
?n
i=1 P (ti | ti?1, ti?2).
(2)
The trigram probability P (W | T ) in formula 2
replaces (Hajic? et al, 2001b) the common (and less
accurate) bigram approach. We will use this tagger
as a baseline system for further improvements.
Initially, we change the formula 1 by introduc-
ing a scaling mechanism1: T? = arg maxT (?T ?
logP (T ) + logP (W | T )).
We tag the word sequence from right to left, i.e.
we change the trigram probability P (W | T ) from
formula 2 to P (wi | ti, ti+1).
Both the output probability P (wi | ti, ti+1) and
the transition probability P (T ) suffer a lot due to
the data sparseness problem. We introduce a com-
ponent P (endingi | ti, ti+1), where ending con-
sists of the last three characters of wi. Also, we in-
troduce another component P (t?i | t
?
i+1, t
?
i+2) based
on a reduced tagset T ? that contains positions POS,
GENDER, NUMBER and CASE only (chosen on
linguistic grounds).
1The optimum value of the scaling parameter ?T can be
tuned using held-out data.
We upgrade all trigrams to fourgrams; the
smoothing mechanism for fourgrams is history-
based bucketing (Krbec, 2005).
The final fine-tuned HMM tagger thus uses all
the enhancements and every component contains its
scaling factor which has been computed using held-
out data. The total error rate reduction is 13.98 %
relative on development data, measured against the
baseline HMM tagger.
2.2 Morc?e
TheMorc?e2 tagger assumes some of the HMMprop-
erties at runtime, namely those that allow the Viterbi
algorithm to be used to find the best tag sequence for
a given text. However, the transition weights are not
probabilities. They are estimated by an Averaged
Perceptron described in (Collins, 2002). Averaged
Perceptron works with features which describe the
current tag and its context.
Features can be derived from any information we
already have about the text. Every feature can be
true or false in a given context, so we can regard
current true features as a description of the current
tag context.
For every feature, the Averaged Perceptron stores
its weight coefficient, which is typically an integer
number. The whole task of Averaged Perceptron is
to sum all the coefficients of true features in a given
context. The result is passed to the Viterbi algorithm
as a transition weight for a given tag. Mathemati-
cally, we can rewrite it as:
w(C, T ) =
n?
i=1
?i.?i(C, T ) (3)
where w(C, T ) is the transition weight for tag T in
context C, n is number of features, ?i is the weight
coefficient of ith feature and ?(C, T )i is evaluation
of ith feature for context C and tag T .
Weight coefficients (?) are estimated on training
data, cf. (Votrubec, 2006). The training algorithm
is very simple, therefore it can be quickly retrained
and it gives a possibility to test many different sets of
features (Votrubec, 2005). As a result, Morc?e gives
the best accuracy from the standalone taggers.
2The name Morc?e stands for ?MORfologie C?Es?tiny?
(?Czech morphology?).

2.3 The Feature-Based Tagger
The Feature-based tagger, taken also from the PDT
(Hajic? et al, 2006) distribution used in our exper-
iments uses a general log-linear model in its basic
formulation:
pAC(y | x) =
exp(
?n
i=1 ?ifi(y, x))
Z(x)
(4)
where fi(y, x) is a binary-valued feature of the event
value being predicted and its context, ?i is a weight
of the feature fi, and the Z(x) is the natural normal-
ization factor.
The weights ?i are approximated by Maximum
Likelihood (using the feature counts relative to all
feature contexts found), reducing the model essen-
tially to Naive Bayes. The approximation is nec-
essary due to the millions of the possible features
which make the usual entropy maximization infeasi-
ble. The model makes heavy use of single-category
Ambiguity Classes (AC)3, which (being indepen-
dent on the tagger?s intermediate decisions) can be
included in both left and right contexts of the fea-
tures.
2.4 The rule-based component
The approach to tagging (understood as a stand-
alone task) using hand-written disambiguation rules
has been proposed and implemented for the first
time in the form of Constraint-Based Grammars
(Karlsson, 1995). On a larger scale, this aproach was
applied to English, (Karlsson, 1995) and (Samuels-
son, 1997), and French (Chanod, 1995). Also (Bick,
2000) uses manually written disambiguation rules
for tagging Brazilian Portuguese, (Karlsson, 1985)
and (Koskenniemi, 1990) for Finish and (Oflazer,
1997) reports the same for Turkish.
2.4.1 Overview
In the hybrid tagging system presented in this pa-
per, the rule-based component is used to further re-
duce the ambiguity (the number of tags) of tokens
in an input sentence, as output by the morphological
processor (see Sect. 1). The core of the component
is a hand-written grammar (set of rules).
Each rule represents a portion of knowledge of
the language system (in particular, of Czech). The
3If a token can be a N(oun), V(erb) or A(djective), its (major
POS) Ambiguity Class is the value ?ANV?.
knowledge encoded in each rule is formally defined
in two parts: a sequence of tokens that is searched
for in an input sentence and the tags that can be
deleted if the sequence of tokens is found.
The overall strategy of this ?negative? grammar is
to keep the highest recall possible (i.e. 100 %) and
gradually improve precision. In other words, when-
ever a rule deletes a tag, it is (almost) 100% safe that
the deleted tag is ?incorrect? in the sentence, i.e. the
tag cannot be present in any correct tagging of the
sentence.
Such an (virtually) ?error-free? grammar can par-
tially disambiguate any input and prevent the subse-
quent taggers (stochastic, in our case) to choose tags
that are ?safely incorrect?.
2.4.2 The rules
Formally, each rule consists of the description of
the context (sequence of tokens with some special
property), and the action to be performed given the
context (which tags are to be discarded). The length
of context is not limited by any constant; however,
for practical purposes, the context cannot cross over
sentence boundaries.
For example: in Czech, two finite verbs cannot
appear within one clause. This fact can be used to
define the following disambiguation rule:
? context: unambiguous finite verb, fol-
lowed/preceded by a sequence of tokens
containing neither a comma nor a coordinat-
ing conjunction, at either side of a word x
ambiguous between a finite verb and another
reading;
? action: delete the finite verb reading(s) at the
word x.
It is obvious that no rule can contain knowledge
of the whole language system. In particular, each
rule is focused on at most a few special phenomena
of the language. But whenever a rule deletes a tag
from a sentence, the information about the sentence
structure ?increases?. This can help other rules to be
applied and to delete more and more tags.
For example, let?s have an input sentence with two
finite verbs within one clause, both of them ambigu-
ous with some other (non-finite-verbal) tags. In this
situation, the sample rule above cannot be applied.
69
On the other hand, if some other rule exists in the
grammar that can delete non-finite-verbal tags from
one of the tokens, then the way for application of the
sample rule is opened.
The rules operate in a loop in which (theoreti-
cally) all rules are applied again whenever a rule
deletes a tag in the partially disambiguated sentence.
Since deletion is a monotonic operation, the algo-
rithm is guaranteed to terminate; effective imple-
mentation has also been found in (Kve?ton?, 2006).
2.4.3 Grammar used in tests
The grammar is being developed since 2000 as
a standalone module that performs Czech morpho-
logical disambiguation. There are two ways of rule
development:
? the rules developed by syntactic introspection:
such rules are subsequently verified on the cor-
pus material, then implemented and the imple-
mented rules are tested on a testing corpus;
? the rules are derived from the corpus by intro-
spection and subsequently implemented.
In particular, the rules are not based on examina-
tion of errors of stochastic taggers.
The set of rules is (manually) divided into two
(disjoint) reliability classes ? safe rules (100% re-
liable rules) and heuristics (highly reliable rules, but
obscure exceptions can be found). The safe rules re-
flect general syntactic regularities of Czech; for in-
stance, no word form in the nominative case can fol-
low an unambiguous preposition. The less reliable
heuristic rules can be exemplified by those account-
ing for some special intricate relations of grammati-
cal agreement in Czech.
The grammar consists of 1727 safe rules and 504
heuristic rules. The system has been used in two
ways:
? safe rules only: in this mode, safe rules are ex-
ecuted in the loop until some tags are being
deleted. The system terminates as soon as no
rule can delete any tag.
? all rules: safe rules are executed first (see safe
rules only mode). Then heuristic rules start
to operate in the loop (similarly to the safe
rules). Any time a heuristic rule deletes a tag,
the safe rules only mode is entered as a sub-
procedure. When safe rules? execution termi-
nates, the loop of heuristic rules continues. The
disambiguation is finished when no heuristic
rule can delete any tag.
The rules are written in the fast LanGR formalism
(Kve?ton?, 2006) which is a subset of more general
LanGR formalism (Kve?ton?, 2005). The LanGR for-
malism has been developed specially for writing and
implementing disambiguation rules.
3 Methods of combination
3.1 Serial combination
The simplest way of combining a hand-written dis-
ambiguation grammar with a stochastic tagger is to
let the grammar reduce the ambiguity of the tagger?s
input. Formally, an input text is processed as fol-
lows:
1. morphological analysis (every input token gets
all tags that are plausible without looking at
context);
2. rule-based component (partially disambiguates
the input, i.e. deletes some tags);
3. the stochastic tagger (gets partially disam-
biguated text on its input).
This algorithm was already used in (Hajic? et
al., 2001b), only components were changed ? the
ruled-based component was significantly improved
and two different sets of rules were tried, as well
as three different statistical taggers. The best result
was (not surprisingly) achieved with set of safe rules
followed by the Morc?e tagger.
An identical approach was used in (Tapanainen,
1994) for English.
3.2 Serial combination with SUBPOS
pre-processing
Manual inspection of the output of the application of
the hand-written rules on the development data (as
used in the serial combination described in the pre-
vious section) discovered that certain types of dead-
locked (?cross-dependent?) rules prevent successful
disambiguation.
70
Cross-dependence means that a rule A can not
apply because of some remaining ambiguity, which
could be resolved by a ruleB, but the operation ofB
is still dependent on the application of A. In particu-
lar, ambiguity in the Part-of-Speech category is very
problematic. For example, only a few safe rules can
apply to a three-word sentence where all three words
are ambiguous between finite verbs and something
else.
If the Part-of-Speech ambiguity of the input is al-
ready resolved, precision of the rule-based compo-
nent and also of the final result after applying any of
the statistical taggers improves. Full Part-of-Speech
information is represented by the first two categories
of the Czech morphology tagset ? POS and SUB-
POS, which deals with different types of pronouns,
adverbs etc. As POS is uniquely determined by
SUBPOS (Hajic? et al, 2006), it is sufficient to re-
solve the SUBPOS ambiguity only.
All three taggers achieve more than 99% accuracy
in SUBPOS disambiguation. For SUBPOS disam-
biguation, we use the taggers in usual way (i.e. they
determine the whole tag) and then we put back all
tags having the same SUBPOS as the tag chosen by
the tagger.
Thus, the method with SUBPOS pre-processing
operates in four steps:
1. morphological analysis;
2. SUBPOS disambiguation (any tagger);
3. rule-based component;
4. final disambiguation (the same tagger4).
The best results were again achieved with the tag-
ger Morc?e and set of safe rules.
3.3 Combining more taggers in parallel
This method is quite different from previous ones,
because it essentially needs more than one tagger. It
consists of the following steps:
1. morphological analysis;
4This limitation is obviously not necessary, but we treat this
combination primarily as a one-tagger method. Results of em-
ploying two different taggers are only slightly better, but still
much worse than results of other methods presented later be-
low.
2. running N taggers independently;
3. merging the results from the previous step ?
each token ends up with between 1 and N tags,
a union of the taggers? outputs;
4. (optional: the rule-based component;)
5. final disambiguation (single tagger).
The best results were achieved with two taggers
in Step 1 (Feature-based and Morc?e), set of all rules
in Step 3 and the HMM tagger in Step 4.
This method is based on an assumption that dif-
ferent stochastic taggers make complementary mis-
takes, so that the recall of the ?union? of taggers
is almost 100 %. Several existing language mod-
els are based on this assumption ? (Brill, 1998)
for tagging English, (Borin, 2000) for tagging Ger-
man and (Vidova?-Hladka?, 2000) for tagging inflec-
tive languages. All these models perform some kind
of ?voting? ? for every token, one tagger is selected
as the most appropriate to supply the correct tag.
The model presented in this paper, however, entrusts
the selection of the correct tag to another tagger that
already operates on the partially disambiguated in-
put.
4 Results
All the methods presented in this paper have been
trained and tested on the PDT version 2.05. Tag-
gers were trained on PDT 2.0 training data set
(1,539,241 tokens), the results were achieved on
PDT 2.0 evaluation-test data set (219,765 tokens),
except Table 6, where PDT 2.0 development-test
data set (201,651 tokens) was used. The morpholog-
ical analysis processor and all the taggers were used
in versions from April 2006 (Hajic? et al, 2006), the
rule-based component is from September 2006.
For evaluation, we use both precision and recall
(and the corresponding F-measure) and accuracy,
since we also want to evaluate the partial disam-
biguation achieved by the hand-written rules alone.
Let t denote the number of tokens in the test data,
let c denote the number of tags assigned to all to-
kens by a disambiguation process and let h denote
5The results cannot be simply (number-to-number) com-
pared to previous results on Czech tagging, because different
training and testing data (PDT 2.0 instead of PDT 1.0) are used
since 2006.
71
the number of tokens where the manually assigned
tag is present in the output of the process.
? In case of the morphological analysis processor
and the standalone rule-based component, the
output can contain more than one tag for ev-
ery token. Then precision (p), recall (r) and F-
measure (f ) characteristics are defined as fol-
lows:
p = h/c r = h/t f = 2pr/(p + r).
? The output of the stochastic taggers contains al-
ways exactly one tag for every token ? then
p = r = f = h/t holds and this ratio is de-
noted as accuracy.
Table 2 shows the performance of the morpholog-
ical analysis processor and the standalone rule-based
component. Table 3 shows the performance of the
standalone taggers. The improvement of the combi-
nation methods is presented in Table 4.
Table 5 shows the relative error rate reduction.
The best method presented by this paper (parallel
combination of taggers with all rules) reaches the
relative error rate decrease of 11.48 % in compari-
son with the tagger Morc?e (which achieves the best
results for Czech so far).
Table 6 shows error rate (100 % ? accuracy) of
various methods6 on particular positions of the tags
(13 and 14 are omitted). The most problematic posi-
tion is CASE (5), whose error rate was significantly
reduced.
5 Conclusion
We have presented several variations of a novel
method for combining statistical and hand-written
rule-based tagging. In all cases, the rule-based
component brings an improvement ? the smaller
the involvement of the statistical component(s) is,
the bigger. The smallest gain can be observed
in the case of the parallel combination of taggers
(which by itself brings an expected improvement).
The best variation improved the accuracy of the
best-performing standalone statistical tagger by over
6F-b stands for feature-based taggeer, Par for parallel com-
bination without rules and Par+Rul for parallel combination
with rules.
11 % (in terms of relative error rate reduction), and
the inclusion of the rule-component itself improved
the best statistical-only combination by over 3.5 %
relative.
This might actually lead to pessimism regarding
the rule-based component. Most other inflective lan-
guages however have much smaller datasets avail-
able than Czech has today; in those cases, we expect
that the contribution of the rule-based component
(which does not depend on the training data size, ob-
viously) will be much more substantial.
The LanGR formalism, now well-developed,
could be used for relatively fast development for
other languages. We are, of course, unable to give
exact figures of what will take less effort ? whether
to annotate more data or to develop the rule-based
component for a particular language. Our feeling is
that the jury is actually still out on this issue, de-
spite some people saying that annotation is always
cheaper: annotation for morphologically complex
(e.g., inflective) languages is not cheap, and rule-
based development efforts have not been previously
using (unannotated) corpora so extensively (which
is what LanGR supports for ?testing? the developed
rules, leading to more reliable rules and more effec-
tive development cycle).
On the other hand, the rule-based component has
also two obvious and well-known disadvantages: it
is language dependent, and the application of the
rules is slower than even the baseline HMM tagger
despite the ?fast? version of the LanGR implemen-
tation we are using7.
In any case, our experiments produced a software
suite which gives the all-time best results in Czech
tagging, and we have offered to apply it to re-tag the
existing 200 mil. word Czech National Corpus. It
should significantly improve the user experience (for
searching the corpus) and allow for more precise ex-
periments with parsing and other NLP applications
that use that corpus.
7In the tests presented in this paper, the speed of the op-
eration of each stochastic tagger (and the parallel combination
without rules) is several hundreds of tokens processed per sec-
ond (running on a 2.2GHz Opteron processor). The operation of
the standalone rule-based component, however, is cca 10 times
slower ? about 40 tokens per second. The parallel combination
with all rules processes about 60 tokens per second ? the rules
operate faster here because their input in parallel combination
is already partially disambiguated.
