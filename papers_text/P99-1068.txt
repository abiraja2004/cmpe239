STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a language- 
independent system for automatic discovery 
of text in parallel translation on the World 
Wide Web. This paper extends the prelim- 
inary STRAND results by adding automatic 
language identification, scaling up by orders 
of magnitude, and formally evaluating perfor- 
mance. The most recent end-product is an au- 
tomatically acquired parallel corpus comprising 
2491 English-French document pairs, approxi- 
mately 1.5 million words per language. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Text in parallel translation is a valuable re- 
source in natural language processing. Sta- 
tistical methods in machine translation (e.g. 
(Brown et al, 1990)) typically rely on large 
quantities of bilingual text aligned at the doc- 
ument or sentence level, and a number of 
approaches in the burgeoning field of cross- 
language information retrieval exploit parallel 
corpora either in place of or in addition to map- 
pings between languages based on information 
from bilingual dictionaries (Davis and Dunning, 
1995; Landauer and Littman, 1990; Hull and 
Oard, 1997; Oard, 1997). Despite the utility of 
such data, however, sources of bilingual text are 
subject to such limitations as licensing restric- 
tions, usage fees, restricted omains or genres, 
and dated text (such as 1980's Canadian poli- 
tics); or such sources imply may not exist for

language pairs of interest. 
Although the majority of Web content is in 
English, it also shows great promise as a source 
of multilingual content. Using figures from 
the Babel survey of multilinguality on the Web 
(htZp :/ /www. i soc .  o rg / ) ,  it is possible to esti- 
mate that as of June, 1997, there were on the or- 
der of 63000 primarily non-English Web servers, 
ranging over 14 languages. Moreover, a follow- 
up investigation of the non-English servers ug- 
gests that nearly a third contain some useful 
cross-language data, such as parallel English on 
the page or links to parallel English pages - -  
the follow-up also found pages in five languages 
not identified by the Babel study (Catalan, Chi- 
nese, Hungarian, Icelandic, and Arabic; Michael 
Littman, personal communication). Given the 
continued explosive increase in the size of the 
Web, the trend toward business organizations 
that cross national boundaries, and high levels 
of competition for consumers in a global mar- 
ketplace, it seems impossible not to view mul- 
tilingual content on the Web as an expanding 
resource. Moreover, it is a dynamic resource, 
changing in content as the world changes. For 
example, Diekema et al, in a presentation atthe 
1998 TREC-7 conference (Voorhees and Har- 
man, 1998), observed that the performance of 
their cross-language information retrieval was 
hurt by lexical gaps such as Bosnia/Bosnie- 
this illustrates a highly topical missing pair in 
their static lexical resource (which was based on 
WordNet 1.5). And Gey et al, also at TREC-7, 
observed that in doing cross-language r trieval 
using commercial machine translation systems, 
gaps in the lexicon (their example was acupunc- 
ture/Akupunktur) could make the difference be- 
tween precision of 0.08 and precision of 0.83 on 
individual queries.

STRA N D (S t ructura l  T rans la t ion  Recognition fo r  
Acquiring Natural Data) designed to explore 
the Web as a source of parallel text, demon- 
strating its potential with a small-scale valu- 
ation based on the author's judgments. After 
briefly reviewing the STRAND architecture and 
preliminary results (Section 2), this paper goes 
beyond that preliminary work in two significant 
ways. First, the framework is extended to in- 
clude a filtering stage that uses automatic lan- 
guage identification to eliminate an important 
class of false positives: documents that appear 
structurally to be parallel translations but are in 
fact not in the languages of interest. The system 
is then run on a somewhat larger scale and eval- 
uated formally for English and Spanish using 
measures of agreement with independent human 
judges, precision, and recall (Section 3). Sec- 
ond, the algorithm is scaled up more seriously to 
generate large numbers of parallel documents, 
this time for English and French, and again sub- 
jected to formal evaluation (Section 4). The 
concrete nd result reported here is an automat- 
ically acquired English-French parallel corpus 
of Web documents comprising 2491 document 
pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per lan- 
guage (without markup), containing little or no 
noise. 
2 STRAND Pre l iminar ies  
This section is a brief summary of the STRAND 
system and previously reported preliminary re- 
sults (Resnik, 1998). 
The STRAND architecture is organized as a 
pipeline, beginning with a candidate generation 
stage that (over-)generates candidate pairs of 
documents that might be parallel translations. 
(See Figure 1.) The first implementation f the 
generation stage used a query to the Altavista 
search engine to generate pages that could be 
viewed as "parents" of pages in parM\]el transla- 
tion, by asking for pages containing one portion 
of anchor text (the readable material in a hy- 
perlink) containing the string "English" within 
a fixed distance of another anchor text contain- 
ing the string "Spanish". (The matching pro- 
cess was case-insensitive.) This generated many 
good pairs of pages, such as those pointed to by 
hyperlinks reading Click here for English ver- 
sion and Click here for Spanish version, as well 
as many bad pairs, such as university pages con- 
taining links to English Literature in close prox- 
imity to Spanish Literature. 
The candidate generation stage is followed 
by a candidate valuation stage that represents 
the core of the approach, filtering out bad can- 
didates from the set of generated page pairs. 
It employs a structural recognition algorithm 
exploiting the fact that Web pages in parallel 
translation are invariably very similar in the 
way they are structured - -  hence the 's' in 
STRAND. For example, see Figure 2. 
The structural recognition algorithm first 
runs both documents through a transducer 
that reduces each to a linear sequence of 
tokens corresponding to HTML markup 
elements, interspersed with tokens repre- 
senting undifferentiated "chunks" of text. 
For example, the transducer would replace 
the HTML source text <TITLE>hCL'99 
Conference Home Page</TITLE> with the 
three tokens \[BEGIN: TITLE\], \[Chunk: 24\], and 
\[END:TITLE\]. The number inside the chunk 
token is the length of the text chunk, not 
counting whitespace; from this point on only 
the length of the text chunks is used, and 
therefore the structural filtering algorithm is 
completely language independent. 
Given the transducer's output for each doc- 
ument, the structural filtering stage aligns the 
two streams of tokens by applying a standard, 
widely available dynamic programming algo- 
rithm for finding an optimal alignment between 
two linear sequences. 1 This alignment matches 
identical markup tokens to each other as much 
as possible, identifies runs of unmatched tokens 
that appear to exist only in one sequence but 
not the other, and marks pairs of non-identical 
tokens that were forced to be matched to each 
other in order to obtain the best alignment pos-

Figure 2: Structural similarity in parallel translations on the Web 
sible. 2 At this point, if there were too many 
unmatched tokens, the candidate pair is taken 
to be prima facie unacceptable and immediately 
filtered out. 
Otherwise, the algorithm extracts from the 
alignment hose pairs of chunk tokens that were 
matched to each other in order to obtain the 
best alignments. 3 It then computes the corre- 
lation between the lengths of these non-markup 
text chunks. As is well known, there is a re- 
\]\]ably linear relationship in the lengths of text 
translations - -  small pieces of source text trans- 
late to smaJl pieces of target text, medium to 
medium, and large to large. Therefore we can 
apply a standard statistical hypothesis test, and 
if p < .05 we can conclude that the lengths are 
reliably correlated and accept the page pair as 
likely to be translations of each other. Other- 
wise, this candidate page pair is filtered out. 4 
2An anonymous reviewer observes that d i f f  has no 
preference for aligning chunks of similar lengths, which 
in some cases might lead to a poor alignment when a 
good one exists. This could result in a failure to identify 
true translations and is worth investigating further. 
3Chunk tokens with exactly equal lengths are ex- 
cluded; see (Resnik, 1998) for reasons and other details 
of the algorithm. 
4The level of significance (p < .05) was the ini- 
tial selection during algorithm development, and never 
changed. This, the unmatched-tokens threshold for 
prima/aeie rejection due to mismatches (20~0), and the 
maximum distance between hyperlinks in the genera- 
In the preliminary evaluation, I generated a 
test set containing 90 English-Spanish candi- 
date pairs, using the candidate generation stage 
as just described? I evaluated these candi- 
dates by hand, identifying 24 as true translation 
pairs. 5 Of these 24, STRAND identified 15 as true 
translation pairs, for a recall of 62.5%. Perhaps 
more important, it only generated 2 additional 
translation pairs incorrectly, for a precision of 
15/17 = s8.2%. 
3 Add ing  Language Ident i f i ca t ion  
In the original STRAND architecture, addi- 
tional filtering stages were envisaged as pos- 
sible (see Figure 1), including such language- 
dependent processes as automatic language 
identification and content-based comparison of 
structually aligned document segments using 
cognate matching or existing bilingual dictio- 
naries. Such stages were initially avoided in 
order to keep the system simple, lightweight, 
and independent of linguistic resources? How- 
tion stage (10 lines), are parameters of the algorithm 
that were determined during development using a small 
amount of arbitrarily selected French-English data down- 
loaded from the Web. These values work well in prac- 
tice and have not been varied systematically; their values 
were fixed in advance of the preliminary evaluation and 
have not been changed since.

Figure 3: Structurally similar pages that are not translations 
ever, in conducting an error analysis for the pre- 
liminary evaluation~ and further exploring the 
characteristics of parallel Web pages, it became 
evident that such processing would be impor- 
tant in addressing one large class of potential 
false positives. Figure 3 illustrates: it shows 
two documents that are generated by looking 
for "parent" pages containing hyperlinks to En- 
glish and Spanish, which pass the structural fil- 
ter with flying colors. The problem is poten- 
tially acute if the generation stage happens to 
yield up many pairs of pages that come from on- 
line catalogues or other Web sites having large 
numbers of pages with a conventional structure. 
There is, of course, an obvious solution that 
will handle most such cases: making sure that 
the two pages are actually written in the lan- 
guages they are supposed to be written in. In 
order to filter out candidate page pairs that 
fail this test, statistical language identification 
based on character n-grams was added to the 
system (Dunning, 1994). Although this does 
introduce a need for language-specific training 
data for the two languages under consideration, 
it is a very mild form of language dependence: 
Dunning and others have shown that when 
classifying strings on the order of hundreds or 
thousands of characters, which is typical of the 
non-markup text in Web pages, it is possible 
to discriminate languages with accuracy in the 
high 90% range for many or most language pairs 
given as little as 50k characters per language as 
training material. 
For the language filtering stage of STRAND, 
the following criterion was adopted: given two 
documents dl and d2 that are supposed to be 
in languages L1 and L2, keep the document 
pair iff Pr(Ll ldl) > Pr(L21dl) and Pr(/21d2) > 
Pr(Llld2). For English and Spanish, this trans- 
lates as a simple requirement that the "English" 
page look more like English than Spanish, and 
that the "Spanish" page look more like Spanish 
than English. Language identification is per- 
formed on the plain-text versions of the pages. 
Character 5-gram models for languages under 
consideration are constructed using 100k char- 
acters of training data from the European Cor- 
pus Initiative (ECI), available from the Linguis- 
tic Data Consortium (LDC). 
In a formal evaluation, STRAND with the new 
language identification stage was run for English 
and Spanish, starting from the top 1000 hits 
yielded up by Altavista in the candidate gen- 
eration stage, leading to a set of 913 candidate 
pairs. A test set of 179 items was generated for 
annotation by human judges, containing: 
? All the pairs marked GOOD (i.e. transla- 
tions) by STRAND (61); these are the pairs 
that passed both the structural and lan- 
guage identification filter. 
? All the pairs filtered out via language idea- 
530 
tification (73) 
? A random sample of the pairs filtered out 
structurally (45) 
It was impractical to manually evaluate all pairs 
filtered out structurally, owing to the time re- 
quired for judgments and the desire for two in- 
dependent judgments per pair in order to assess 
inter-judge reliability. 
The two judges were both native speakers of 
Spanish with high proficiency in English, nei- 
ther previously familiar with the project. They 
worked independently, using a Web browser to 
access test pairs in a fashion that allowed them 
to view pairs side by side. The judges were 
told they were helping to evaluate a system that 
identifies pages on the Web that are translations 
of each other, and were instructed to make de- 
cisions according to the following criterion: 
Is this pair of pages intended to show 
the same material to two different 
users, one a reader of English and the 
other a reader of Spanish? 
The phrasing of the criterion required some con- 
sideration, since in previous experience with hu- 
man judges and translations I have found that 
judges are frequently unhappy with the qual- 
ity of the translations they are looking at. For 
present purposes it was required neither that 
the document pair represent a perfect transla- 
tion (whatever that might be), nor even nec- 
essarily a good one: STR,AND was being tested 
not on its ability to determine translation qual- 
ity, which might or might not be a criterion for 
inclusion in a parallel corpus, but rather its abil- 
ity to facilitate the task of locating page pairs 
that one might reasonably include in a corpus 
undifferentiated by quality (or potentially post- 
filtered manually). 
The judges were permitted three responses: 
? Yes: translations of each other 
? No: not translations of each other 
? Unable to tell 
When computing evaluation measures, page 
pairs classified in the third category by a hu- 
man judge, for whatever eason, were excluded 
from consideration.

Table 1: English-Spanish evaluation 
Table 1 shows agreement measures between 
the two judges, between STRAND and each 
individual judge, and the agreement between 
STRAND and the intersection of the two judges' 
annotations - -  that is, STRAND evaluated 
against only those cases where the two judges 
agreed, which are therefore the items we can re- 
gard with the highest confidence. The table also 
shows Cohen's to, an agreement measure that 
corrects for chance agreement (Carletta, 1996); 
the most important ? value in the table is the 
value of 0.7 for the two human judges, which 
can be interpreted as sufficiently high to indi- 
cate that the task is reasonably well defined. 
(As a rule of thumb, classification tasks with 
< 0.6 are generally thought of as suspect in 
this regard.) The value of N is the number of 
pairs that were included, after excluding those 
for which the human judgement in the compar- 
ison was undecided. 
Since the cases where the two judges agreed 
can be considered the most reliable, these were 
used as the basis for the computation of recall 
and precision. For this reason, and because 
the human-judged set included only a sample 
of the full set evaluated by STRAND, it was nec- 
essary to extrapolate from the judged (by both 
judges) set to the full set in order to compute 
recall/precision figures; hence these figures are 
reported as estimates. Precision is estimated 
as the proportion of pages judged GOOD by 
STRAND that were also judged to be good (i.e. 
"yes") by both judges - -  this figure is 92.1% 
Recall is estimated as the number of pairs that 
should have been judged GOOD by STRAND 
(i.e. that recieved a "yes" from both judges) 
that STRAND indeed marked GOOD - -  this fig- 
ure is 47.3%. 
These results can be read as saying that of ev- 
ery 10 document pairs included by STRAND in 
a parallel corpus acquired fully automatically 
from the Web, fewer than 1 pair on average was 
included in error. Equivalently, one could say  
that the resulting corpus contains only about 
531 
8% noise. Moreover, at least for the confidently 
judged cases, STRAND is in agreement with the 
combined human judgment more often than the 
human judges agree with each other. The recall 
figure indicates that for every true translation 
pair it accepts, STRAND must also incorrectly re- 
ject a true translation pair. Alternatively, this 
can be interpreted as saying that the filtering 
process has the system identifying about half 
of the pairs it could in principle have found 
given the candidates produced by the genera- 
tion stage. Error analysis suggests that recall 
could be increased (at a possible cost to pre- 
cision) by making structural filtering more in- 
telligent; for example, ignoring some types of 
markup (such as italics) when computing align- 
ments. However, I presume that if the number 
M of translation pairs on the Web is large, then 
half of M is also large. Therefore I focus on in- 
creasing the total yield by attempting to bring 
the number of generated candidate pairs closer 
to M, as described in the next section. 
4 Scaling Up Candidate Generation 
The preliminary experiments and the new ex- 
periment reported in the previous ection made 
use of the Altavista search engine to locate "par- 
ent" pages, pointing off to multiple language 
versions of the same text. However, the same 
basic mechanism is easily extended to locate 
"sibling" pages: cases where the page in one 
language contains a link directly to the trans- 
lated page in the other language. Exploration 
of the Web suggests that parent pages and sib- 
ling pages cover the major relationships between 
parallel translations on the Web. Some sites 
with bilingual text are arranged according to a 
third principle: they contain a completely sep- 
arate monolingual sub-tree for each language, 
with only the single top-level home page point- 
ing off to the root page of single-language v r- 
sion of the site. As a first step in increasing 
the number of generated candidate page pairs, 
STRAND was extended to permit both parent 
and sibling search criteria. Relating monolin- 
gual sub-trees is an issue for future work. 
In principle, using Altavista queries for 
the candidate generation stage should enable 
STRAND to locate every page pair in the A1- 
tavista index that meets the search criteria. 
This likely to be an upper bound on the can-

didates that can be obtained without building 
a Web crawler dedicated to the task, since one 
of Altavista's distinguishing features is the size 
of its index. In practice, however, the user inter- 
face for Altavista appears to limit the number 
of hits returned to about the first 1000. It was 
possible to break this barrier by using a feature 
of Altavista's "Advanced Search": including a 
range of dates in a query's selection criteria. 
Having already redesigned the STRAND gener- 
ation component to permit multiple queries (in 
order to allow search for both parent and sibling 
pages), each query in the query set was trans- 
formed into a set of mutually exclusive queries 
based on a one-day range; for example, one ver- 
sion of a query would restrict he result to pages 
last updated on 30 November 1998, the next 29 
November 1998, and so forth. 
Although the solution granularity was not 
perfect - -  searches for some days still bumped 
up against he 1000-hit maximum - -  use of both 
parent and sibling queries with date-range re- 
stricted queries increased the productivity of 
the candidate generation component by an or- 
der of magnitude. The scaled-up system was 
run for English-French document pairs in late 
November, 1998, and the generation component 
produced 16763 candidate page pairs (with du- 
plicates removed), an 18-fold increase over the 
previous experiment. After eliminating 3153 
page pairs that were either exact duplicates 
or irretrievable, STRAND'S structural filtering 
removed 9820 candidate page pairs, and the 
language identification component removed an- 
other 414. The remaining pairs identified as 
GOOD - -  i.e. those that STRAND considered 
to be parallel translations - -  comprise a paral- 
lel corpus of 3376 document pairs. 
A formal evaluation, conducted in the same 
fashion as the previous experiment, yields the 
agreement data in Table 2. Using the cases 
where the two human judgments agree as 
ground truth, precision of the system is esti- 
mated at 79.5%, and recall at 70.3%.

Table 3: English-French evaluation with stricter 
language ID criterion 
A look at STRAND'S errors quickly identifies 
the major source of error as a shortcoming of 
the language identification module: its implicit 
assumption that every document is either in En- 
glish or in French. This assumption was vi- 
olated by a set of candidates in the test set, 
all from the same site, that pair Dutch pages 
with French. The language identification cri- 
terion adopted in the previous section requires 
only that the Dutch pages look more like En- 
glish than like French, which in most cases is 
true. This problem is easily resolved by train- 
ing the existing language identification compo- 
nent with a wider range of languages, and then 
adopting a stricter filtering criterion requiring 
that Pr(Englishldl ) > Pr(Lldl ) for every lan- 
guage L in that range, and that d2 meet the 
corresponding requirement for French. 6 Doing 
so leads to the results in Table 3. 
This translates into an estimated 100% pre- 
cision against 64.1% recall, with a yield of 2491 
documents, approximately 1.5 million words per 
language as counted after removal of HTML 
markup. That is, with a reasonable though 
admittedly post-hoc revision of the language 
identification criterion, comparison with human 
subjects suggests the acquired corpus is non- 
trivial and essentially noise free, and moreover, 
that the system excludes only a third of the 
pages that should have been kept. Naturally 
this will need to be verified in a new evaluation 
on fresh data. 
SLanguage ID across a wide range of languages is 
not. difficult to obtain. E.g. see the 13-language set 
of the freely available CMU stochastic language iden- 
tifier (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/,,~dougb/ident.html), 
the 18-language set of the Sun Language ID Engine 
(ht tp: / /www.sunlabs.com /research /ila/ demo /index.html ), 
or the 31-language set of the XRCE Language 
Identifier (http://www.rxrc.xerox.com/research/ 
mltt/Tools/guesser.html). Here I used the language ID 
method of the previous section trained with profiles 
of Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, 
Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.

This paper places acquisition of parallel text 
from the Web on solid empirical footing, mak- 
ing a number of contributions that go beyond 
the preliminary study. The system has been 
extended with automated language identifica- 
tion, and scaled up to the point where a non- 
trivial parallel corpus of English and French can 
be produced completely automatically from the 
World Wide Web. In the process, it was discov- 
ered that the most lightweight use of language 
identification, restricted to just the the language 
pair of interest, needed to be revised in favor of a 
strategy that includes identification over a wide 
range of languages. Rigorous evaluation using 
human judges suggests that the technique pro- 
duces an extremely clean corpus - -  noise esti- 
mated at between 0 and 8% - -  even without hu- 
man intervention, requiring no more resources 
per language than a relatively small sample of 
text used to train automatic language identifi- 
cation. 
Two directions for future work are appar- 
ent. First, experiments need to be done using 
languages that are less common on the Web. 
Likely first pairs to try include English-Korean, 
English-Italian, and English-Greek. Inspection 
of Web sites - -  those with bilingual text identi- 
fied by STRAND and those without - -  suggests 
that the strategy of using Altavista to generate 
candidate pairs could be improved upon signifi- 
cantly by adding a true Web crawler to "mine" 
sites where bilingual text is known to be avail- 
able, e.g. sites uncovered by a first pass of the 
system using the Altavista engine. I would con- 
jecture that for English-French there is an order 
of magnitude more bilingual text on the Web 
than that uncovered in this early stage of re- 
search. 
A second natural direction is the applica- 
tion of Web-based parallel text in applications 
such as lexical acquisition and cross-language 
information retrieval - -  especially since a side- 
effect of the core STRAND algorithm is aligned 
"chunks", i.e. non-markup segments found to 
correspond to each other based on alignment 
of the markup. Preliminary experiments using 
even small amounts of these data suggest hat 
standard techniques, uch as cross-language lex- 
ical association, can uncover useful data.
