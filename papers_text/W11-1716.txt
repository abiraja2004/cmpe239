Abstract
In most tasks related to opinion mining and
sentiment analysis, it is necessary to compute
the semantic orientation (i.e., positive or neg-
ative evaluative implications) of certain opin-
ion expressions. Recent works suggest that se-
mantic orientation depends on application do-
mains. Moreover, we think that semantic ori-
entation depends on the specific targets (fea-
tures) that an opinion is applied to. In this pa-
per, we introduce a technique to build domain-
specific, feature-level opinion lexicons in a
semi-supervised manner: we first induce a lex-
icon starting from a small set of annotated
documents; then, we expand it automatically
from a larger set of unannotated documents,
using a new graph-based ranking algorithm.
Our method was evaluated in three different
domains (headphones, hotels and cars), using
a corpus of product reviews which opinions
were annotated at the feature level. We con-
clude that our method produces feature-level
opinion lexicons with better accuracy and re-
call that domain-independent opinion lexicons
using only a few annotated documents.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a modern subdiscipline of nat-
ural language processing which deals with subjec-
tivity, affects and opinions in texts (a good survey on
this subject can be found in (Pang and Lee, 2008)).
This discipline is also known as opinion mining,
mainly in the context of text mining and information
extraction. Many classification and extraction prob-
lems have been defined, with different levels of gran-
ularity depending on applications requirements: e.g.
classification of text documents or smaller pieces
of text into objective and subjective, classification
of opinionated documents or individual sentences
regarding the overall opinion (into ?positive? and
?negative? classes, or into a multi-point scale) or ex-
traction of individual opinions from a piece of text
(may include opinion target, holder, polarity or in-
tensity of the opinions, among others). As a key in
solving most of these problems, the semantic orien-
tation of some opinion expressions should be com-
puted: a numeric value, usually between ?1 and 1,
referring to the negative or positive affective impli-
cations of a given word or prhase. These values can
be collected in an opinion lexicon, so this resource
can be accessed when needed.
Many recent works (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005;
Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Cruz et al, 2010;
Qiu et al, 2011) suggest the need for domain-
specific opinion lexicons, containing semantic ori-
entations of opinion expressions when used in a par-
ticular domain (e.g., the word ?predictable? has op-
posite semantic orientations when used to define the
driving experience of a car or the plot of a movie).
Moreover, within a given domain, the specific target
of the opinion is also important to induce the po-
larity and the intensity of the affective implications
of some opinion expressions ( consider for example
the word ?cheap? when referring to the price or to
the appearance of an electronic device). This is es-
pecially important to extract opinions from product
reviews, where users write their opinions about indi-
vidual features of a product. These domain-specific,
feature-level opinion lexicons can be manually col-
lected, but it implies a considerable amount of time
125
and effort, especially if a large number of different
domains are considered.
In this work, we propose a method to automati-
cally induce feature-level, domain-specific opinion
lexicons from an annotated corpus. As we are com-
mitted to reduce the time and effort, we research
about the automatic expansion of this kind of lexi-
cons, so we keep the number of required annotated
documents as low as possible. In order to do so, we
propose a graph-based algorithm which can be ap-
plied to other knowledge propagation problems.
In the next section, we review some related previ-
ous works to contextualize our approach. In section
3, we define the feature-level opinion lexicons and
describe our method to induce and expand them in a
semi-supervised manner. In section 4, we carry out
some experiments over a dataset of reviews of three
diferent domains. Finally, we discuss the results and
draw some conclusions in section 5.
2 Related work
In this section, we briefly discuss some related
works about semantic orientation induction and
opinion lexicon expansion, pointing out the main
differences with our contribution. We also intro-
duce the feature-based opinion extraction task, since
it is the natural application context for feature-level
opinion lexicons.
2.1 Semantic orientation induction
Many methods for computing semantic orientations
of words or phrases have been proposed over the
last years. Some of them rely on a large set of
text documents to compute semantic orientations of
words in an unsupervised manner (Hatzivassiloglou
and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Yu
and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). They all start from a
few positive and negative seeds, and calculate the se-
mantic orientation of target words based on conjunc-
tive constructions (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown,
1997) or co-occurrences (Turney and Littman, 2003;
Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) of target words and
seeds. These methods allow computing domain-
specific semantic orientations, just using a set of
documents of the selected domain, but they obtain
modest values of recall and precision. We are us-
ing the observations about conjunctive constructions
from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) in our
approach.
Other works use the lexical resource Word-
Net(Fellbaum, 1998) to compute the semantic ori-
entation of a given word or phrase. For example, in
(Kamps et al, 2004), a distance function between
words is defined using WordNet synonymy rela-
tions, so the semantic orientation of a word is cal-
culated from the distance to a positive seed (?good?)
and a negative seed (?bad?). Other works use a big-
ger set of seeds and the synonyms/antonyms sets
from WordNet to build an opinion lexicon incremen-
tally (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Kim and Hovy, 2004).
In other works (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Bac-
cianella et al, 2010; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), the
basic assumption is that if a word is semantically
oriented in one direction, then the words in its gloss
(i.e. textual definitions) tend to be oriented in the
same direction. Two big sets of positive and nega-
tive words are built, starting from two initial sets of
seed words and growing them using the synonymy
and antonymy relations in WordNet. For every word
in those sets, a textual representation is obtained by
collecting all the glosses of that word. These textual
representations are transformed into vectors by stan-
dard text indexing techniques, and a binary classifier
is trained using these vectors. The same assumption
about words and their glosses is made by Esuli and
Sebastiani (2007), but the relation between words
and glosses are used to build a graph representation
of WordNet. Given a few seeds as input, two scores
of positivity and negativity are computed, using a
random-walk ranking algorithm similar to PageR-
ank (Page et al, 1998). As a result of these works, an
opinion lexicon named SentiWordNet (Baccianella
et al, 2010) is publicly available. We are also us-
ing a ranking algorithm in our expansion method,
but applying it to a differently built, domain-specific
graph of terms.
The main weakness of the dictionary-based ap-
proaches is that they compute domain-independent
semantic orientations. There are some manually-
collected lexicons (Stone, 1966; Cerini et al, 2007),
with semantic orientations of terms set by humans.
However, they are also domain-independent re-
sources.

2.2 Opinion lexicon expansion
There are a couple of works that deal with the more
specific problem of opinion lexicon expansion. In
(Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), the authors pro-
pose an algorithm to automatically expand an initial
opinion lexicon based on context coherency, the ten-
dency for same polarities to appear successively in
contexts. In (Qiu et al, 2011), a method to automat-
ically expand an initial opinion lexicon is presented.
It consists of identifing the syntactic relations be-
tween opinion words and opinion targets, and using
these relations to automatically identify new opinion
words and targets in a bootstrapping process. Then,
a polarity (positive or negative) is assigned to each
of these new opinion words by applying some con-
textual rules. In both works, the opinion lexicons
being expanded are domain-specific, but they are not
taking into account the dependency between the spe-
cific targets of the opinions and the semantic orienta-
tions of terms used to express those opinions. To our
knowledge, there are no previous works on inducing
and expanding feature-level opinion lexicons.
2.3 Feature-based opinion extraction
Feature-based opinion extraction is a task related to
opinion mining and information extraction. It con-
sists of extracting individual opinions from texts, in-
dicating the polarity and the specific target of each
opinion; then, these opinions can be aggregated,
summarized and visualized. It was first defined by
Hu and Liu (2004b), and attemped by many oth-
ers (Popescu and Etzioni (2005), Ding et al (2008)
and Cruz et al (2010), among others), because of
its practical applications. Being a key element in
this task, most of these works propose algorithms to
compute semantic orientations of terms, generally
domain-specific orientations. We aim to build not
only domain-specific but also feature-level opinion
lexicons, in an attempt to improve the performance
of a feature-based opinion extraction system (a de-
scription of our system can be found in (Cruz et al,
2010)).
3 Proposed method
In this section we define feature-level opinion lex-
icons and propose a semi-supervised method to ob-
tain it. The method consists of two main steps. First,
a small lexicon is induced from a set of annotated
documents. Then, the lexicon is automatically ex-
panded using a set of unannotated documents.
3.1 Definitions
A domain D is a class of entities with a fixed set of
opinable features FD. A feature is any component,
part, attribute or property of an entity. A feature-
based opinion is any piece of text with positive or
negative implications on any feature of an entity. We
name opinion words to the minimun set of words
from an opinion from which you can decide the po-
larity (i.e., if it is a positive or a negative opinion). A
feature-level opinion lexicon LD for a given domain
D is a function T ?FD ? [?1.0, 1.0], where T is a
set of terms (i.e., individual words or phrases), and
FD is the set of opinable features for the domain D.
LD assign a semantic orientation to each term from
T when used as opinion words in an opinion on a
particular feature from FD.
3.2 Induction
In order to generate a feature-based opinion lexicon
to be used as seed in our expansion experiments,
we collect a set of text reviews RD on a partic-
ular domain D, and annotate all the feature-based
opinions we encounter. Each opinion is a tuple
(polarity, f, opW ), where polarity is + (positive)
or - (negative), f is a feature from FD, and opW
is a set of opinion words from the text. Each anno-
tated opinion gives information about the semantic
orientation of the opinion words. Most of the times,
the polarity of the opinion implies the polarity of the
opinion words. But sometimes, the opinion words
include some special expressions that have to be
considered to induce the polarity of the rest of opin-
ion words, as negation expressions1, which invert
the polarity of the rest of opinion words; and domi-
nant polarity expressions2, which completely deter-
mine the polarity of an opinion, no matter which
other opinion words take part. For each opinion term
observed (individual words or phrases included as
opinion words, once negation and dominant polarity
1Negation expressions: barely, hardly, lack, never, no, not,
not too, scarcely.
2Dominant polarity expressions: enough, sufficient, suffi-
ciently, reasonably, unnecessarily, insufficient, insufficiently,
excessive, excessively, overly, too, at best, too much.
127
expressions been removed), the final semantic orien-
tation for a given feature is the mean of the semantic
orientations suggested by each annotated opinion on
that feature containing the opinion expression (we
take 1.0/-1.0 for each positive/negative annotation).
3.3 Expansion
Starting from a big set of unannotated text reviews
R?D, we use the information provided by conjunctive
constructions to expand the lexicon previously in-
duced. As explained by Hatzivassiloglou and McK-
eown (1997), two opinion terms appearing in a con-
junctive constructions tend to have semantic orienta-
tions with the same or opposite directions, depend-
ing on the conjunction employed. Based on this
principle, we build a graph linking those terms ap-
pearing in a conjunctive expression. We compute
the semantic orientation of each term spreading the
information provided by those terms in the initial
lexicon through the graph. In order to do that, we
propose a new random-walk ranking algorithm with
the ability to deal with graphs containing positively
and negatively weighted edges.
3.3.1 Building the graph
The graph is built from R?D, searching for con-
junctive constructions between terms. Two terms
participate in a conjunctive construction if they ap-
pear consecutively in the text separated by a con-
junction and or but, or the puntuation mark comma
(,). There are two types of conjunctive construc-
tions, direct and inverse, depending on the conjunc-
tion and the negation expressions participating. In
a direct conjunctive construction, both terms seems
to share the same semantic orientation; in a reverse
one, they might have opposite semantic orientations.
Some examples are shown next:
? Direct conjunctive constructions
The camera has a bright and accurate len.
It is a marvellous, really entertaining movie.
. . . clear and easy to use interface.
. . . easy to understand, user-friendly interface.
? Inverse conjunctive constructions
The camera has a bright but inaccurate len.
It is a entertaining but typical film.
The driving is soft and not aggresive.
The terms observed in conjunctive constructions
(in bold type in the previous examples) are the nodes
of the graph. If two terms participate in a con-
junctive cosntruction, the corresponding nodes are
linked by an edge. Each edge is assigned a weight
equal to the number of direct conjunctive construc-
tions minus the number of inverse conjunctive con-
structions observed between the linked terms.
3.3.2 PolarityRank
We propose a new random-walk ranking algo-
rithm, named PolarityRank. It is based on PageRank
(Page et al, 1998). In summary, PageRank com-
putes the relevance of each node in a graph based on
the incoming edges and the relevance of the nodes
participating in those edges; an edge is seen as a rec-
ommendation of one node to another. PolarityRank
generalizes the concept of vote or recommendation,
allowing edges with positive and negative weights.
A positive edge still means a recommendation, more
strongly the greater the weight of the edge. By con-
trast, a negative edge represents a negative feedback,
more strongly the greater the absolute value of the
weight. PolarityRank calculates two scores for each
node, a positive and a negative one (PR+ and PR?,
respectively). Both scores are mutually dependent:
the positive score of a node n is increased in pro-
portion to the positive score of the nodes linked to n
with positively weighted edges; in addition, the pos-
itive score of n is also increased in proportion to the
negative score of the nodes linked to n with nega-
tively weighted edges. The same principles apply to
the calculus of the negative scores of the nodes.
The algorithm definition is as follows. Let G =
(V,E) be a directed graph where V is a set of
nodes and E a set of directed edges between pair of
nodes. Each edge of E has an associated real value
or weight, distinct from zero, being pji the weight
associated with the edge going from node vj to vi.
Let us define Out(vi) as the set of indices j of the
nodes for which there exists an outgoing edge from
vi. Let us define In+(vi) and In?(vi) as the sets of
indices j of the nodes for which there exists an in-
coming edge to vi whose weight is positive or neg-
ative, respectively. We define the positive and neg-
ative PolarityRank of a node vi (equation 1), where
the values e+ and e? are greater than zero for cer-
tain nodes acting as positive or negative seeds, re-
128
spectively. The parameter d is a damping factor that
guarantees convergence; in our experiments we use
a value of 0.85 (as recommended in the original def-
inition of PageRank). The computation of PR+ and
PR? is done iteratively as described by Page et al
(1998).
PR+(vi) = (1? d)e

The sum of the values of e+ and e? must be equal
to the number of nodes in the graph.
3.3.3 Extending the lexicon
Based on a seed lexicon LD, and a set of unanno-
tated reviews R?D, the expanded lexicon L
?
D is ob-
tained following these steps:
1. Build a graph G = (V,E) representing the
conjunctive relations observed in R?D.
2. For each feature f from FD:
(a) For each vi from V with associated term
ti, such that LD(ti, f) is defined, assign
that value to e+i if it is greater than 0, else
assign it to e?i .
(b) Linearly normalize the values of e+i and
e?i , so that the sum of the values is equal
to |V |.
(c) Compute PR+ and PR?.
(d) For each vi from V with associated term
ti, assign SO(vi) to L?D(ti, f), where:
SO(vi) =
PR+(vi)? PR?(vi)
PR+(vi) + PR?(vi)
Note that these values are contained in the
interval [?1.0, 1.0].
4 Experiments
In this section we report the results of some exper-
iments aimed to evaluate the quality of the feature-
level opinion lexicons obtained by our method.
4.1 Data
We used a set of reviews of three different domains
(headphones, hotels and cars). We retrieved them
from Epinions.com, a website specialized in prod-
uct reviews written by customers. Some reviews
from the dataset were labeled, including the polarity,
the feature and the opinion words of each individual
opinion found. Some information of the dataset is
shown in table 1. The dataset is available for public
use3.
Domain Reviews Opinions Features
Headphones 587 (2591) 3897 31
Hotels 988 (6171) 11054 60
Cars 972 (23179) 8519 91
Table 1: Information of the dataset. The number of un-
nanotated reviews available for each domain is shown in
parenthesis.
4.2 Experimental setup
All the experiments were done using 10-fold cross-
validation. Each annotated dataset was randomly
partitioned into ten subsets. The results reported for
each experiment are the average results obtained in
ten different runs, taking a different subset as testing
set and the remaining nine subsets as training set (to
induce seed lexicons). To evaluate the lexicons, we
compute recall and precision over the terms partic-
ipating as opinion words in the opinions annotated
in the testing set. Recall is the proportion of terms
which are contained in the lexicon; precision is the
proportion of terms with a correct sentiment orien-
tation in the lexicon.
4.3 Results
Table 2 shows the results of the evaluation of the in-
duced and expanded lexicons. In order to figure out
the gain in precision and recall obtained by our ex-
pansion method, we induced lexicons for each do-
main using different numbers of annotated reviews

and expanding them using the whole set of unanno-
tated reviews. For each domain, we show the re-
sults of experiments using only nine annotated re-
views (one from each subset of reviews of the cross-
validation process), and using all the available anno-
tated reviews. The second and third experiments for
each domain are those where F1 scores for the in-
duced lexicon is similar to the F1 scores for the ex-
panded lexicon from the previous experiment. Thus,
we can measure the number of additional anno-
tated reviews needed to obtain similar results with-
out expansion. Using only nine annotated reviews,
the expanded feature-level opinion lexicon achieves
0.8158 of F1 for the headphones domain, 0.8764 for
the hotels domain and 0.8853 for the cars domain,
a far better result that using a domain-independent
opinion lexicon4. To obtain similar F1 scores with-
out using the expansion method, you should anno-
tate between six and thirteen times more reviews.
5 Conclusions
There is evidence that the semantic orientation of
an opinion term not only depends on the domain,
but also on the specific feature which that term is
applied to. In this paper, we propose a method to
automatically induce domain-specific, feature-level
4We perform some experiment using the domain-
independent opinion lexicon SentiWordNet (Baccianella
et al, 2010), obtaining F1 values equal to 0.7907, 0.8199 and
0.8243 for the headphones, hotels and cars domains.
opinion lexicons from annotated datasets. We re-
search about the automatic expansion of this kind of
lexicons, so we keep the number of required anno-
tated documents as low as possible. The results of
the experiments confirm the utility of feature-level
opinion lexicons in opinion mining tasks such as
feature-based opinion extraction, reaching 0.9538 as
average of F1 in three tested domains. Even though
if only a few annotated reviews are available, the lex-
icons produced by our automatic expansion method
reach an average F1 of 0.8592, which is far bet-
ter that using domain-independent opinion lexicon.
Our expansion method is based on the representa-
tion of terms and their similarities and differences
in a graph, and the application of a graph-based
algorithm (PolarityRank) with the ability to deal
with positively and negatively weighted graphs. The
same algorithm can be applied to other knowledge
propagation problems, whenever a small amount of
information on some of the entities involved (and
about the similarities and differences between the
entities) is available. For example, we applied the
same algorithm to compute trust and reputation in
social networks(Ortega et al, 2011).
