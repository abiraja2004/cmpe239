Abstract 
This article is concerned with the building of a test data 
set for assisting the industrial user in machine translation 
evaluation. The emphasis is laid on the interest of an 
approach based on the study of bilingual corpus pragmatic 
characteristics. The study of one chapter of the 
maintenance manual of the Super Puma helicopter made it 
possible to identify the pragmatic characteristics relevant 
in the choice of the morpho-syntactic structures and 
translation processes actually used. The textual test set 
consists in a SGML file including the source text sequences 
aligned with the reference translation sequences and also 
including the pragmatic, formal and translational 
characteristics in the form of annotations (labels and 
formal descriptions). 
Introduction 
Corpus studies appear to be one of the most appropriate 
techniques to identify the linguistic constraints and needs 
which will be used as evaluation measurements and criteria 
to judge the adequacy of a machine translation system to an 
industrial user's environment. In this article, the linguistic 
constraints correspond to the linguistic characteristics of 
the corpora to be treated by the machine translation 
system. These constraints are illustrated in the source 
language corpora to be submitted to machine translation. 
The linguistic needs correspond to the minimal level of 
quality required for the produced translation. These needs 
are illustrated in a human attested translation of the 
chosen source corpora. The identification and formalisation 
of the linguistic constraints and needs illustrated in 
corpora represent a major step during the evaluation 
process of machine translation applications by an industrial 
user. Corpus study is not a new concept in the NLP domain, 
but the methods used can be quite different depending on 
the expected results and applications. In this article, we will 
describe how we built a reusable annotated test set 
through the study of a bilingual corpus. 
1 A highly structured documentation 
The corpus we chose to study is the maintenance manual for 
the Super Puma helicopter written in French and its 
attested human translation in English 1. An important 
characteristic of this corpus is that it is written and used 
in compliance with the so-called ATA 2 100 specification. 
1.1 ATA 100: a short presentation 
Tile ATA 100 specification role is to provide a set of rules 
for the writing and exploitation of aircraft after-sale 
documents. Both document writers and users are supposed 
to be familiar with this specification. As such, the ATA 100 
specification defines the document production and use 
environment. In particular, the specification imposes a very 
strict way of structuring the text in terms of topical and 
discursive organisation, and also in terms of practical 
document production by providing a dedicated SGML DTD 
for the maintenance manuals (ATA 100 DTD). The 
relevance of ATA 100 in the writing and exploiting process 
of the document encouraged us to consider the corpus from 
a quite new point of view in the NLP domain: the pragmatic 
approach. The ATA 100 specification can indeed be 
considered as a sociolectal system or standard (i.e. a 
system that rules the communicative usage inside a 
restrained community of persons). 
From a communicative point of view the ATA specification 
defines the types of discursive genres (illocutionary force 
of the utterances) the writer has to adopt according to a 
pre-defined document structure. For example, all the 
maintenance documents must be divided into tasks and 
subtasks. Each maintenance task description should be 
preceded by a definition of this task. Any task to be 
performed should be described as a succession of subtasks 
which are explained in the form of a succession of orders. 
Each task and subtask has a precise denomination that 
takes the form of titles in the document. Because the 
maintenance manuals are submitted to annual updates, the 
document contains also a large number of factual 
information such as dates, version numbers, aircraft type 
reference, page numbers etc. The production and 
1 Because of the huge volume of the document (7 Mo of plain 
text), we chose to select a representative sample of it : 
chapter 10. Parking and Mooring.

exploitation environment having a strong impact on the way 
the documents are written, it was quite natural to first 
characterise the corpus we were intending to study from a 
pragmatics point of view. 
12 Pragmatic labelling of sequences 
For us, the pragmatic labelling was a first step in the 
classification of utterances based on their communicative 
value. Practically, we decided to assign to each utterance 
of the text a label indicating its textual and discursive 
status according to the ATA 100 indications. The 
pragmatic study of the corpus resulted in the definition of 
4 types of labels: the meta-textual indicators, the topical 
meta-utterances, the discursive meta-utterances and the 
illocutionary typed utterances (orders, definitions, etc.). 
For example, the METNORM and METXNORM labels 
correspond to the Task and Subtask titles in the text: 
Stockage des instruments 
D#stockage des atterrisseurs 
Remise en service de I'appareil 
The illocutionary aim of the METNORM or -XNORM is to 
help the user understanding the topical organisation of the 
document. They actually illustrate the operational 
organisation of the maintenance work to be done by the 
user. 
2 Underlying syntactic behaviours 
The second step of the corpus study consisted in the 
observation of the formal structures of the utterances 
previously labelled from a pragmatic point of view. As we 
can notice in the above examples, the pragmatic value of the 
utterances has a very clear incidence on their morpho- 
syntactic structure. 
2.1 Some observations 
In our corpus, we observed that the Meta-Textual 
Indicators usually present a phrasal structure (they are not 
complete sentences) and include a large number of 
brachygraphical signs (acronyms, codes, alpha-numerical 
references, etc.). The meta utterances are all nominal 
phrases resulting from the nominalisation of verbal groups: 
Stockage des instruments 
Destockage des atterrisseurs 
or from the topicalisation of an object: 
E-16ments tockfis en containers pressuris6s 
Nominalisation and topicalisation can thus be considered as 
processes used by the writer to "textualise" knowledge for 
its reader. 
As far as the Directive - Operation Utterances (EDOPER) 
are concerned, we also could observe very strong 
regularities which are all based on the same morpho- 
syntactic basic scheme: VERB + OBJECT, the verb is 
always an infinitive one, the real subject (the reader) is 
never mentioned and adverbial complements may be 
inserted at specific places in the sentence depending on 
their semantic value (time, manner, place, mean, etc.). 
22 Typical morpho-syntactic schemes 
This type of morpho-syntactic observations has been 
carried out for all the utterances of the text and resulted 
in the definition of twelve morpho-syntactic basic schemes 
presenting the characteristics of the linguistic structures 
used by the writer. Our morpho-syntactic schemes are 
based on the concept of syntagmatic omponents which are 
further specified using a set of features. We used two 
kinds of features: morphological features (tense, mode, 
voice, derivation, etc.), and functional features (manner 
adverbial complement, direct object, subject, agent, etc.). 
For example, most of the Topical Meta-Utterances (MET) 
correspond to the morpho-syntactic scheme SNDEV which 
is the following: 
N + (AJ) + (SN1) + (SPIISN2) 3 + (SAVISP2) 4 
with the following features: 
? N: deverb = +, indicating that the noun (N) is the 
result of the nominalisation of a verb (deverb) 
? A J: fonction = #pith#te, indicating that the adjective 
(AJ) has the function of modifier, 
? SNI: fonction = COMPADV and type = temps, 
indicating that the nominal phrase has a function of 
adverbial complement (COMPADV) with a "time" 
semantic (type = temps) 
? SPI: fonction = dev-OBJ and prep = de, indicating 
that the prepositional phrase has a function of object 
of a nominalisation (dev-OBJ) introduced by the 
preposition de (prep = de). 
? SN2: fonction = dev-OBJ, indicating that the nominal 
phrase has a function of direct (there is no 
prepositional introducer) object of a nominalisation 
(dev-OBJ) 
? SAV and SP2: fonction = COMPADV and type = 
mani#re, indicating that the SAV and/or the SP2 have 
the function of adverbial complement (COMPADV) 
with a "manner" semantics (type = maniere). 
The scheme presentation reflects the results of a textual 
study and in order to formalise some particular phenomena, 
we had to introduce some specific features such as 
"deverb" for the nouns resulting from the nominalisation of 
verbs. These schemes are actually generic representations 
that allow us to characterise all the textual sequences of 
our corpus using only 12 scheme labels. 
2.3 Co-description 
The study of the possible co-description of an utterance 
by a pragmatic label on one hand and by a morpho-syntactic 
scheme on the other hand made it possible to assess 
compatibilities and incompatibilites between the pragmatic 
value of an utterance and its linguistic structure. The 
following table shows that for each pragmatic value, we can 
find a typical underlying morpho-syntactic structure.

At this stage of the corpus study, we described each 
textual sequence of our text with two labels: a pragmatic 
one (indicating the textual and illocutionary status of the 
sequence) and a morpho-syntactic one (describing its 
formal behaviour). 
3 Underlying translational behaviours 
The third step of the corpus study intended to show that 
it was possible to add translational information on the 
already obtained pragmatic and morpho-syntactic 
information. To get these translational information, we 
carried out a contrastive study of our French text with its 
attested human translation. 
3.1 Some observations 
The pragmatic characteristics of the text apparently 
implied some translation choices. Indeed, for us, only the 
directive illocutionary value of utterances could explain the 
choice of translating the French infinitive verbs in English 
imperative verbs. Infinitive, in French has no intrinsic value 
of imperative ; all the infinitive verbs in French are not 
necessarily translated by an imperative verb in English. 
Also, the pragmatic phenomena of "terminologisation" 
which are not the same in French and in English explain the 
possible structural non correspondence between some 
nominal phrases: 
Appareil entrepos6 non stock6 
--> Aircraft Stored-No Preservation Measures 
or between some sentences. The keeping of the pragmatic 
value from French to English can also lead to the restitution 
in English of some missing elements in French: 
rotation des roues 
--> rotate the wheels. 
3.2 Translational annotations 
The contrastive study led us to identify some recurrent (in 
our corpus) translational consequences due to the 
pragmatic value preservation from French to English. This 
part of the study resulted also in the identification of some 
phenomena that ffave to be strictly formalised if we want 
them to be correctly handled by a machine translation 
system. This is the case for the terminological elements 
that may have quite unpredictable translations (or 
equivalents): 
GTM--> Engines 
Circuits an&no..barom#triques --> Air Data Systems 
Concerning the problem of term translation, the best 
solution we found for annotating the test set consists in 
tagging them in the French sequence and in the English 
corresponding sequence using SGML tags (<T> and </T>): 
Verifier la <T>BTP</T> 
--> Check < T>MGB</T> 
Concerning the morpho-syntactic translational 
observations, we chose to express them in the form of an 
"oriented rule" attached to the French-English pair of 
corresponding sequences. If we take the example of 
determination in the Topical Met&Utterances (topical 
titles), we observe that the nominal phrases which are the 
object of a nominalisation are nearly always determined: 
Destockage de la structure 
Nettoyage des parties m#talliques 
whereas they are systematically undetermined in English: 
Depreservation of airframe 
Cleaning of metal parts 
The annotation concerning the omission of determiner in 
English is the following: 
V + SP --> V + SP(DT-) 5 
and is attached to the concerned pairs of English-French 
sequences. 
4 Building an annotated test set 
The corpus study allowed us to get a large number of 
information concerning the French text on one hand, and the 
English text on the other hand. We also have information on 
the corpus-specific translational processes used from 
French to English. In order to build the test set, it 
appeared necessary to structure this information so that it 
could be exploited by the industrial evaluator. 
4.1 Defining an annotation scheme 
To structure our annotated test set, we defined a so- 
called "annotation scheme" and we adopted the descriptive 
language SGML. The test set is based on the notion of 
equivalent textual sequence pairs directly extracted from 
the aligned French-English original studied corpus. Each 
pair of aligned sequences compose what we called a test 
unit. The information concerning the French sequence is 
directly attached to it (morpho-syntactic scheme, 
5 V for Verb, SP for Prepositional Phrase, 
Determiner. 
DT for 
1063 
complete morpho-syntactic description and tagged 
terms) ;the information concerning the English sequence is 
directly attached to it (complete morpho-syntactic 
description and tagged terms) and the information 
concerning the sequence pair (pragmatic label, factual 
data) is attached to the created test unit. 
4.2 The use of SGML 
To really get a structured file of annotated test data, we 
chose to build it in compliance with the SGML ISO 
standard. We thus wrote an SGML DTD in order to 
formalise the conceptual annotation scheme. The result 
obtained for the following sequence pair: 
Stockage appareil complet 
--> Storage of complete aircraft 
is the following: 
<UTEST NUM="0001" CHAPNUM="10" 
PRAGTYPE="METNORM" PARTRAD="I-I"> 
<SEQS STRGEN="SNDEV"> 
<LIB>Stockage appareil complet 
<LIBD>N_deverbatif + dev-OBJ\[SN(N + AJ)\] 
<SEQC> LANG="EN"> 
<LIB>Storage of complete aircraft 
<LIBD>N_deverbatif lex + dev-OBJ\[SP(PP + SN(AJ + 
N))\]> 
<ETRAD CDLANG="FR-EN"> 
<TRADN NUM="01">N_deverbatif--> N_deverbatif_lex 
<TRADN NUM="02">dev-OBJ\[SN\] --> dev-OBJ\[SP\] 
This format, though a bit complex for an human eye, has the 
advantage to clearly separate annotations from the original 
textual data. Moreover, this format allows an easy 
exploitation of the contained data provided the evaluator 
uses SGML tools with which selection and extraction of 
subset of data become really easy (each tagged data is a 
potential selection criteria). 
Conclusion 
The interest of building this kind of annotated test set 
from corpora is multiple. First, it allows the evaluator to 
have at his disposal a whole set of potential test data which 
are clearly representative of his real industrial needs. 
Being enriched by pragmatic and morpho-syntactic 
annotations, it considerably helps the evaluator to clearly 
identify the phenomena well or badly handled by a machine 
translation system. Indeed, using the annotations, the 
evaluator can easily link the mistakes of a machine 
translation system with the concerned linguistic units. 
The presence of a reference annotated translation is also 
of great help for keeping the evaluator as impartial as 
possible (even if a r~ference human translation may not 
always be the best one). This is particularly true when 
dealing with terminology. Finally, using SGML for the 
building of the test set file allows one to perform targeted 
evaluations by giving extraction criteria such as the 
morpho-syntactic schemes or even the pragmatic labels: an 
evaluator can decide to select all the test units including 
the pragmatic METNORM label in order to carry out a 
specific evaluation of the MT system performances when 
translating the task and subtask titles of the Super Puma 
helicopter maintenance manual. 
As stated above, our initial aim in this corpora study was 
the building of a corpus-based annotated test set, to be 
used for the evaluation of MT systems. The results 
nevertheless seem interesting for some other purposes. 
Firstly, these results are potential contributions to the 
specification of dedicated NLP systems. In particular they 
allow one to suggest heuristics for the processing of 
linguistic phenomena which, in general, are known to be 
complex problems for NLP. One example, in the case of MT, 
is the translation of French determiners into English. 
Another example, in the case of automatic analysis, is the 
resolution of anaphora: more than 80% of the pronouns in 
our corpus refer to the object complement of the last 
sentence. 
On the long run, future MT systems could take advantage 
of the pragmatic information contained in the SGML tags 
of the source text, to drive both the analysis and the 
transfer phases. For example, a verbal form in the 
infinitive, when occurring in a procedural part of French 
text (identified as such via SGML tags) would be analysed 
as a sequence with injunctive value, and translated into 
English by a verbal form in the imperative. When occurring 
in a tittle, a similar infinitive verbal form could be 
translated by an "ing" verbal form.
