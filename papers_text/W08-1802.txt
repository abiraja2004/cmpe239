Abstract
Question answering (QA) is the task of
finding a concise answer to a natural lan-
guage question. The first stage of QA in-
volves information retrieval. Therefore,
performance of an information retrieval
subsystem serves as an upper bound for the
performance of a QA system. In this work
we use phrases automatically identified
from questions as exact match constituents
to search queries. Our results show an im-
provement over baseline on several docu-
ment and sentence retrieval measures on
the WEB dataset. We get a 20% relative
improvement in MRR for sentence extrac-
tion on the WEB dataset when using au-
tomatically generated phrases and a fur-
ther 9.5% relative improvement when us-
ing manually annotated phrases. Surpris-
ingly, a separate experiment on the indexed
AQUAINT dataset showed no effect on IR
performance of using exact phrases.
1 Introduction
Question answering can be viewed as a sophisti-
cated information retrieval (IR) task where a sys-
tem automatically generates a search query from
a natural language question and finds a concise
answer from a set of documents. In the open-
domain factoid question answering task systems
answer general questions like Who is the creator of
The Daily Show?, or When was Mozart born?. A
variety of approaches to question answering have
been investigated in TREC competitions in the last

decade from (Vorhees and Harman, 1999) to (Dang
et al, 2006). Most existing question answering
systems add question analysis, sentence retrieval
and answer extraction components to an IR sys-
tem.
Since information retrieval is the first stage of
question answering, its performance is an up-
per bound on the overall question answering sys-
tem?s performance. IR performance depends on
the quality of document indexing and query con-
struction. Question answering systems create a
search query automatically from a user?s question,
through various levels of sophistication. The sim-
plest way of creating a query is to treat the words
in the question as the terms in the query. Some
question answering systems (Srihari and Li, 1999)
apply linguistic processing to the question, iden-
tifying named entities and other query-relevant
phrases. Others (Hovy et al, 2001b) use ontolo-
gies to expand query terms with synonyms and hy-
pernyms.
IR system recall is very important for question
answering. If no correct answers are present in a
document, no further processing will be able to
find an answer. IR system precision and rank-
ing of candidate passages can also affect question
answering performance. If a sentence without a
correct answer is ranked highly, answer extrac-
tion may extract incorrect answers from these erro-
neous candidates. Collins-Thompson et al (2004)
show that there is a consistent relationship between
the quality of document retrieval and the overall
performance of question answering systems.
In this work we evaluate the use of exact phrases
from a question in document and passage retrieval.
First, we analyze how different parts of a ques-
tion contribute to the performance of the sentence
extraction stage of question answering. We ana-
9
lyze the match between linguistic constituents of
different types in questions and sentences contain-
ing candidate answers. For this analysis, we use a
set of questions and answers from the TREC 2006
competition as a gold standard.
Second, we evaluate the performance of doc-
ument retrieval in our StoQA question answering
system. We compare the performance of docu-
ment retrieval from the Web and from an indexed
collection of documents using different methods of
query construction, and identify the optimal algo-
rithm for query construction in our system as well
as its limitations.
Third, we evaluate passage extraction from a set
of documents. We analyze how the specificity of a
query affects sentence extraction.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we summarize recent approaches to
question answering. In Section 3, we describe the
dataset used in this experiment. In Section 5, we
describe our method and data analysis. In Sec-
tion 4, we outline the architecture of our question
answering system. In Section 6, we describe our
experiments and present our results. We summa-
rize in Section 7.
2 Related Work
Information retrieval (IR) for question answering
consists of 2 steps: document retrieval and passage
retrieval.
Approaches to passage retrieval include sim-
ple word overlap (Light et al, 2001), density-
based passage retrieval (Clarke et al, 2000), re-
trieval based on the inverse document frequency
(IDF) of matched and mismatched words (Itty-
cheriah et al, 2001), cosine similarity between a
question and a passage (Llopis and Vicedo, 2001),
passage/sentence ranking by weighting different
features (Lee and others, 2001), stemming and
morphological query expansion (2004), and vot-
ing between different retrieval methods (Tellex
et al, 2003). As in previous approaches, we
use words and phrases from a question for pas-
sage extraction and experiment with using exactly
matched phrases in addition to words. Similarly
to Lee (2001), we assign weights to sentences in
retrieved documents according to the number of
matched constituents.
Systems vary in the size of retrieved passages.
Some systems identify multi-sentence and variable
size passages (Ittycheriah et al, 2001; Clarke et
al., 2000). An optimal passage size may depend
on the method of answer extraction. We use single
sentence extraction because our system?s semantic
role labeling-based answer extraction functions on
individual sentences.
White and Sutcliffe (2004) performed a man-
ual analysis of questions and answers for 50 of the
TREC questions. The authors computed frequency
of terms matching exactly, with morphological, or
semantic variation between a question and a an-
swer passage. In this work we perform a similar
analysis automatically. We compare frequencies
of phrases and words matching between a question
and candidate sentences.
Query expansion has been investigated in sys-
tems described in (Hovy et al, 2001a; Harabagiu
et al, 2006). They use WordNet (Miller, 1995) for
query expansion, and incorporate semantic roles in
the answer extraction process. In this experiment
we do not expand query terms.
Corpus pre-processing and encoding informa-
tion useful for retrieval was shown to improve doc-
ument retrieval (Katz and Lin, 2003; Harabagiu
et al, 2006; Chu-Carroll et al, 2006). In our
approach we evaluate linguistic question process-
ing technique which does not require corpus pre-
processing.
Statistical machine translation model is used
for information retrieval by (Murdock and Croft,
2005). The model estimates probability of a ques-
tion given an answer and is trained on <question,
candidate sentence> pairs. It capturing synonymy
and grammar transformations using a statistical
model.
3 Data
In this work we evaluate our question answering
system on two datasets: the AQUAINT corpus, a 3
gigabyte collection of news documents used in the
TREC 2006 competition; and the Web.
We use questions from TREC, a yearly ques-
tion answering competition. We use a subset
of questions with non-empty answers 1 from the
TREC 2006 dataset 2. The dataset provides a list
of matching documents from the AQUAINT cor-
pus and correct answers for each question. The
dataset contains 387 questions; the AQUAINT cor-
pus contains an average of 3.5 documents per ques-

10
tion that contain the correct answer to that ques-
tion. Using correct answers we find the correct
sentences from the matching documents. We use
this information as a gold standard for the IR task.
We index the documents in the AQUAINT cor-
pus using the Lucene (Apache, 2004 2008) engine
on the document level. We evaluate document re-
trieval using gold standard documents from the
AQUAINT corpus. We evaluate sentence extrac-
tion on both AQUAINT and the Web automatically
using regular expressions for correct answers pro-
vided by TREC.
In our experiments we use manually and auto-
matically created phrases. Our automatically cre-
ated phrases were obtained by extracting noun,
verb and prepositional phrases and named entities
from the question dataset using then NLTK (Bird
et al, 2008) and Lingpipe (Carpenter and Bald-
win, 2008) tools. Our manually created phrases
were obtained by hand-correcting these automatic
annotations (e.g. to remove extraneous words and
phrases and add missed words and phrases from
the questions).
4 System
For the experiments in this paper we use the StoQA
system. This system employs a pipeline architec-
ture with three main stages as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1: question analysis, document and sentence
extraction (IR), and answer extraction. After the
user poses a question, it is analyzed. Target named
entities and semantic roles are determined. A
query is constructed, tailored to the search tools in
use. Sentences containing target terms are then ex-
tracted from the documents retrieved by the query.
The candidate sentences are processed to identify
and extract candidate answers, which are presented
to the user.
We use the NLTK toolkit (Bird et al, 2008)
for question analysis and can add terms to search
queries using WordNet (Miller, 1995). Our system
can currently retrieve documents from either the
Web (using the Yahoo search API (Yahoo!, 2008)),
or the AQUAINT corpus (Graff, 2002) (through
the Lucene indexer and search engine (Apache,
2004 2008)). When using Lucene, we can assign
different weights to different types of search term
(e.g. less weight to terms than to named entities
added to a query) (cf. (Lee and others, 2001)).
We currently have two modules for answer ex-
traction, which can be used separately or together.
Candidate sentences can be tagged with named en-
tity information using the Lydia system (Lloyd et
al., 2005). The tagged word/phrase matching the
target named entity type most frequently found is
chosen as the answer. Our system can also extract
answers through semantic role labeling, using the
SRL toolkit from (Punyakanok et al, 2008). In
this case, the tagged word/phrase matching the tar-
get semantic role most frequently found is chosen
as the answer.

Question answering is an engineering-intensive
task. System performance improves as more so-
phisticated techniques are applied to data process-
ing. For example, the IR stage in question an-
swering is shown to improve with the help of tech-
niques like predictive annotations and relation ex-
traction; matching of semantic and syntactic re-

lations in a question and a candidate sentence
are known to improve overall QA system perfor-
mance (Prager et al, 2000; Stenchikova et al,
2006; Katz and Lin, 2003; Harabagiu et al, 2006;
Chu-Carroll et al, 2006).
In this work we analyze less resource expensive
techniques, such as chunking and named entity de-
tection, for IR in question answering. Linguistic
analysis in our system is applied to questions and
to candidate sentences only. There is no need for
annotation of all documents to be indexed, so our
techniques can be applied to IR on large datasets
such as the Web.
Intuitively, using phrases in query construction
may improve retrieval precision. For example,
if we search for In what year did the movie win
academy awards? using a disjunction of words
as our query we may match irrelevant documents
about the military academy or Nobel prize awards.
However, if we use the phrase ?academy awards?
as one of the query terms, documents with this
term will receive a higher ranking. A counterargu-
ment for using phrases is that academy and awards
are highly correlated and therefore the documents
that contain both will be more highly ranked. We
hypothesize that for phrases where constituents are
not highly correlated, exact phrase extraction will
give more benefit.
5.2 Search Query
We process each TREC question and target 3 to
identify named entities. Often, the target is a com-
plete named entity (NE), however, in some of the
TREC questions the target contains a named entity,
e.g. tourists massacred at Luxor in 1997, or 1991
eruption of Mount Pinatubo with named entities
Luxor and Mount Pinatubo. For the TREC ques-
tion What was the number of member nations of
the U.N. in 2000?, the identified constituents and
automatically constructed query are shown in Ta-
ble 1. Named entities are identified using Ling-
pipe (Carpenter and Baldwin, 2008), which iden-
tifies named entities of type organization, location
and person. Phrases are identified automatically
using the NLTK toolkit (Bird et al, 2008). We
extract noun phrases, verb phrases and preposi-
tional phrases. The rules for identifying phrases
are mined from a dataset of manually annotated
parse trees (Judge et al, 2006) 4. Converted Q-
phrases are heuristically created phrases that para-
phrase the question in declarative form using a
small set of rules. The rules match a question to a
pattern and transform the question using linguistic
information. For example, one rule matches Who
is|was NOUN|PRONOUN VBD and converts it to
NOUN|PRONOUN is|was VBD. 5
3The TREC dataset alo provides a target topic for each
questions, and we include it in the query.
4The test questions are not in this dataset.
5Q-phrase is extracted only for who/when/where ques-
tions. We used a set of 6 transformation patterns in this ex-
periment.

Named Entities Phrases

pinatubo; miss america; manchester
united; clinton administration
capacity of the ballpark; groath rate; se-
curity council; tufts university endow-
ment; family members; terrorist organi-
zation
Table 2: Automatically identified named entities and phrases
A q-phrase represents how a simple answer is
expected to appear, e. g. a q-phrase for the ques-
tion When was Mozart born? is Mozart was born.
We expect a low probability of encountering a q-
phrase in retrieved documents, but a high prob-
ability of co-occurrence of q-phrases phrase with
correct answers.
In our basic system (baseline), words (trivial
query constituents) from question and target form
the query. In the experimental system, the query is
created from a combination of words, quoted exact
phrases, and quoted named entities. Table 2 shows
some examples of phrases and named entities used
in queries. The goal of our analysis is to evaluate
whether non-trivial query constituents can improve
document and sentence extraction.
We use a back-off mechanism with both of
our IR subsystems to improve document extrac-
tion. The Lucene API allows the user to cre-
ate arbitrarily long queries and assign a weight to
each query constituent. We experiment with as-
signing different weights based on the type of a
query constituent. Assigning a higher weight to
phrase constituents increases the scores for docu-
ments matching a phrase, but if no phrase matches
are found documents matching lower-scored con-
stituents will be returned.
The query construction system for the Web first
produces a query containing only converted q-
phrases which have low recall and high precision
(query 1 in table 1). If this query returns less than
20 results, it then constructs a query using phrases
(query 2 in table 1), if this returns less than 20 re-
sults, queries without exact phrases (queries 3 and
4) are used. Every query contains a conjunction
with the question target to increase precision for
the cases where the target is excluded from con-
verted q-phrase or an exact phrase.
For both our IR subsystems we return a maxi-
mum of 20 documents. We chose this relatively
low number of documents because our answer ex-
traction algorithm relies on semantic tagging of
candidate sentences, which is a relatively time-
consuming operation.
The text from each retrieved documents is split
into sentences using Lingpipe. The same sen-
tence extraction algorithm is used for the output
from both IR subsystems (AQUAINT/Lucene and
Web/Yahoo). The sentence extraction algorithm
assigns a score to each sentence according to the
number of matched terms it contains.
5.3 Analysis of Constituents
For our analysis of the impact of different linguis-
tic constituent types on document retrieval we use
the TREC 2006 dataset which consists of ques-
tions, documents containing answers to each ques-
tion, and supporting sentences, sentences from
these documents that contain the answer to each
question.
Table 3 shows the number of times each con-
stituent type appears in a supporting sentence and
the proportion of supporting sentences containing
each constituent type (sent w/answer column). The
?All Sentences? column shows the number of con-
stituents in all sentences of candidate documents.
The precision column displays the chance that a
given sentence is a supporting sentence if a con-
stituent of a particular type is present in it. Con-
verted q-phrase has the highest precision, followed
by phrases, verbs, and named entities. Words have
the highest chance of occurrence in a supporting
sentence (.907), but they also have a high chance
of occurrence in a document (.745).
This analysis supports our hypothesis that using
exact phrases may improve the performance of in-
formation retrieval for question answering.
6 Experiment
In these experiments we look at the impact of using
exact phrases on the performance of the document
retrieval and sentence extraction stages of question
answering. We use our StoQA question answering
system. Questions are analyzed as described in the
previous section. For document retrieval we use

tion. We performed the experiments using first au-
tomatically generated phrases, and then manually
corrected phrases.
For document retrieval we report: 1) average re-
call, 2) average mean reciprocal ranking (MRR),
and 3) overall document recall. Each question has
a document retrieval recall score which is the pro-
portion of documents identified from all correct
documents for this question. The average recall
is the individual recall averaged over all questions.
MRR is the inverse index of the first correct doc-
ument. For example, if the first correct document
appears second, the MRR score will be 1/2. MRR
is computed for each question and averaged over
all questions. Overall document recall is the per-
centage of questions for which at least one correct
document was retrieved. This measure indicates
the upper bound on the QA system.
For sentence retrieval we report 1) average sen-
tence MRR, 2) overall sentence recall, 3) average
precision of the first sentence, 4) number of cor-
rect candidate sentences in the top 10 results, and
5) number of correct candidate sentences in the top
50 results 6.
Table 4 shows our experimental results. First,
we evaluate the performance of document retrieval
on the indexed AQUAINT dataset. Average doc-
ument recall for our baseline system is 0.53, in-
dicating that on average half of the correct doc-
uments are retrieved. Average document MRR
is .631, meaning that on average the first correct
document appears first or second. Overall docu-
ment recall indicates that 75.6% of queries con-
tain a correct document among the retrieved docu-
ments. Average sentence recall is lower than docu-
ment recall indicating that some proportion of cor-
rect answers is not retrieved using our heuristic
sentence extraction algorithm. The average sen-
tence MRR is .314 indicating that the first correct
sentence is approximately third on the list. With
6Although the number of documents is 20, multiple sen-
tences may be extracted from each document.
14
the AQUAINT dataset, we notice no improvement
with exact phrases.
Next, we evaluate sentence retrieval from the
WEB. There is no gold standard for the WEB
dataset so we do not report document retrieval
scores. Sentence scores on the WEB dataset are
lower than on the AQUAINT dataset 7.
Using back-off retrieval with automatically cre-
ated phrases and named entities, we see an im-
provement over the baseline system performance
for each of the sentence measures on the WEB
dataset. Average sentence MRR increases 20%
from .183 in the baseline to .220 in the experimen-
tal system. With manually created phrases MRR
improves a further 9.5% to .241. This indicates
that information retrieval on the WEB dataset can
benefit from a better quality of chunker and from a
properly converted question phrase. It also shows
that the improvement is not due to simply match-
ing random substrings from a question, but that
linguistic information is useful in constructing the
exact match phrases. Precision of automatically
detected phrases is affected by errors during auto-
matic part-of-speech tagging of questions. An ex-
ample of an error due to POS tagging is the iden-
tification of a phrase was Rowling born due to a
failure to identify that born is a verb.
Our results emphasize the difference between
the two datasets. AQUAINT dataset is a collec-
tion of a large set of news documents, while WEB
is a much larger resource of information from a
variety of sources. It is reasonable to assume
that on average there are much fewer documents
with query words in AQUAINT corpus than on the
WEB. Proportion of correct documents from all re-
trieved WEB documents on average is likely to be
lower than this proportion in documents retrieved
from AQUAINT. When using words on a query
to AQUAINT dataset, most of the correct docu-
ments are returned in the top matches. Our results
indicate that over 50% of correct documents are
retrieved in the top 20 results. Results in table 3
indicate that exactly matched phrases from a ques-
tion are more precise predictors of presence of an
answer. Using exact matched phrases in a WEB
query allows a search engine to give higher rank to
more relevant documents and increases likelihood
of these documents in the top 20 matches.
Although overall performance on the WEB
dataset is lower than on AQUAINT, there is a po-
7Our decision to use only 20 documents may be a factor.
tential for improvement by using a larger set of
documents and improving our sentence extraction
heuristics.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we present a document retrieval ex-
periment on a question answering system. We
evaluate the use of named entities and of noun,
verb, and prepositional phrases as exact match
phrases in a document retrieval query. Our re-
sults indicate that using phrases extracted from
questions improves IR performance on WEB data.
Surprisingly, we find no positive effect of using
phrases on a smaller closed set of data.
Our data analysis shows that linguistic phrases
are more accurate indicators for candidate sen-
tences than words. In future work we plan to evalu-
ate how phrase type (noun vs. verb vs. preposition)
affects IR performance.
