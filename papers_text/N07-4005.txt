1 Introduction
AMI Meeting Facilitator is a system that per-
forms topic segmentation and extractive sum-
marisation. It consists of three components: (1)
a segmenter that divides a meeting into a num-
ber of locally coherent segments, (2) a summa-
rizer that selects the most important utterances
from the meeting transcripts. and (3) a com-
pression component that removes the less im-
portant words from each utterance based on the
degree of compression the user specied. The
goal of the AMI Meeting Facilitator is two-fold:
rst, we want to provide sucient visual aids for
users to interpret what is going on in a recorded
meeting; second, we want to support the devel-
opment of downstream information retrieval and
information extraction modules with the infor-
mation about the topics and summaries in meet-
ing segments.
2 Component Description
2.1 Segmentation
The AMI Meeting Segmenter is trained using a
set of 50 meetings that are seperate from the in-
put meeting. We rst extract features from the
audio and video recording of the input meeting
in order to train the Maximum Entropy (Max-
Ent) models for classifying topic boundaries and
non-topic boundaries. Then we test each utter-
ance in the input meeting on the Segmenter to
see if it is a topic boundary or not. The features
we use include the following ve categories: (1)
Conversational Feature: These include a set
of seven conversational features, including the
amount of overlapping speech, the amount of
silence between speaker segments, the level of
similarity of speaker activity, the number of cue
words, and the predictions of LCSEG (i.e., the
lexical cohesion statistics, the estimated poste-
rior probability, the predicted class). (2) Lex-
ical Feature: Each spurt is represented as a
vector space of uni-grams, wherein a vector is 1
or 0 depending on whether the cue word appears
in the spurt. (3) Prosodic Feature: These
include dialogue-act (DA) rate-of-speech, max-
imum F0 of the DA, mean energy of the DA,
amount of silence in the DA, precedent and sub-
sequent pauses, and duration of the DA. (4)
Motion Feature: These include the average
magnitude of speaker movements, which is mea-
sured by the number of pixels changed, over the
frames of 40 ms within the spurt. (5) Contex-
tual Feature: These include the dialogue act
types and the speaker role (e.g., project man-
ager, marketing expert). In the dialogue act an-
notations, each dialogue act is classied as one
of the 15 types.
2.2 Summarization
The AMI summarizer is trained using a set of
98 scenario meetings. We train a support vec-
tor machine (SVM) on these meetings, using 26
features relating to the following categories: (1)
Prosodic Features: These include dialogue-
act (DA) rate-of-speech, maximum F0 of the
DA, mean energy of the DA, amount of silence
in the DA, precedent and subsequent pauses,
9
and duration of the DA. (2) Speaker Fea-
tures: These features relate to how dominant
the speaker is in the meeting as a whole, and
they include percentage of the total dialogue
acts which each speaker utters, percentage of
total words which speaker utters, and amount
of time in meeting that each person is speak-
ing. (3) Structural Features: These features
include the DA position in the meeting, and the
DA position in the speaker's turn. (4) Term
Weighting Features: We use two types of
term weighting: tf.idf, which is based on words
that are frequent in the meeting but rare across
a set of other meetings or documents, and a sec-
ond weighting feature which relates to how word
usage varies between the four meeting partici-
pants.
After training the SVM, we test on each meet-
ing of the 20 meeting test set in turn, ranking
the dialogue acts from most probable to least
probable in terms of being extract-worthy. Such
a ranking allows the user to create a summary
of whatever length she desires.
2.3 Compression
Each dialogue act has its constituent words
scored using tf.idf, and as the user compresses
the meeting to a greater degree the browser
gradually removes the less important words from
each dialogue act, leaving only the most infor-
mative material of the meeting.
3 Related Work
Previous work has explored the eect of lexi-
cal cohesion and conversational features on char-
acterizing topic boundaries, following Galley et
al.(2003). In previous work, we have also studied
the problem of predicting topic boundaries at
dierent levels of granularity and showed that a
supervised classication approach performs bet-
ter on predicting a coarser level of topic segmen-
tation (Hsueh et al, 2006).
The amount of work being done on speech
summarization has accelerated in recent years.
Maskey and Hirschberg(September 2005) have
explored speech summarization in the domain
of Broadcast News data, nding that combin-
ing prosodic, lexical and structural features yield
the best results. On the ICSI meeting corpus,
Murray et al(September 2005) compared apply-
ing text summarization approaches to feature-
based approaches including prosodic features,
while Galley(2006) used skip-chain Conditional
Random Fields to model pragmatic dependen-
cies between meeting utterances, and ranked
meeting dialogue acts using a combination or
prosodic, lexical, discourse and structural fea-
tures.
