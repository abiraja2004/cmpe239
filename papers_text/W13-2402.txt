Abstract
Despite many methods that effectively
solve sentiment classification task for such
widely used languages as English, there
is no clear answer which methods are
the most suitable for the languages that
are substantially different. In this paper
we attempt to solve Internet comments
sentiment classification task for Lithua-
nian, using two classification approaches ?
knowledge-based and supervised machine
learning. We explore an influence of senti-
ment word dictionaries based on the differ-
ent parts-of-speech (adjectives, adverbs,
nouns, and verbs) for knowledge-based
method; different feature types (bag-of-
words, lemmas, word n-grams, character
n-grams) for machine learning methods;
and pre-processing techniques (emoticons
replacement with sentiment words, dia-
critics replacement, etc.) for both ap-
proaches. Despite that supervised ma-
chine learning methods (Support Vec-
tor Machine and Na??ve Bayes Multino-
mial) significantly outperform proposed
knowledge-based method all obtained re-
sults are above baseline. The best accu-
racy 0.679 was achieved with Na??ve Bayes
Multinomial and token unigrams plus bi-
grams, when pre-processing involved dia-
critics replacement.
1 Introduction
An automatic extraction of opinions from a text
has become an area of growing interest in the
recent years. Due to the user-generated content
available on the Internet companies can measure
the feedback about their products or services; so-
ciologists can look at people?s reaction about pub-
lic events; psychologists can study general mind-
state of communities with regard to various issues;
etc. Thus sentiment classification helps solving
many various tasks, ranging from a very general to
the very specific, requiring special solutions. Ma-
jority of tasks consider the content in general by
focusing on the subjectivity vs. objectivity or se-
mantic orientation (positive vs. negative) detection
of reviews, tweets, blogs, or Internet comments.
Others are solving very specific tasks, e.g. early
threats detection (Bouma et al, 2012), prediction
of user?s potentiality to send out offensive content
(Chen et al, 2012), etc.
But even adaptation to the task is not always ef-
fective due to the variations and complexity of the
language. Sentiments are not always expressed
explicitly, while for the meanings hidden in the
context additional world knowledge is necessary.
Moreover, sentiments may involve sarcasm and be
interpreted differently in various domains and con-
texts. Despite all the mentioned difficulties, senti-
ment classification task is rather easy for us, hu-
mans, but manual analysis is time consuming and
requires a lot of human-resources. Due to this fact
automatic sentiment classifiers are often selected
instead.
Various classification techniques effectively
solve sentiment classification task for such widely
used languages as English, but there is no clear an-
swer which method is the most suitable for Lithua-
nian. Our focus is at finding classification ap-
proach yielding the best results on Lithuanian In-
ternet comments by classifying them into positive,
negative and neutral categories.
2 Related Work
Due to the complexity of sentiment classification
task, there is a vast variety of methods trying
to tackle this problem (for review see Pang and
Lee (2008)).
All methods used to solve sentiment classifi-
cation task fall into the three main categories:
knowledge-based, machine learning and hybrid.
2
In knowledge-based approaches sentiment is seen
as the function of keywords (usually based on their
count). Thus the main task is the construction
of sentiment discriminatory-word lexicons with
indicated class labels (positive or negative) and
sometimes even with their intensiveness. Lexi-
cons are constructed either manually (Taboada et
al., 2011) or semi-automatically making use of
such resources as WordNet (Hu and Liu, 2004);
(Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) or via word associa-
tions based on the heuristics evaluating word?s oc-
currence alongside with the ?seed? words in the
text (Turney, 2002); (Turney and Littman, 2003).
Adjectives (or adjectival phrases) are consid-
ered as the most popular sentiment indicators, e.g.
Benamara et al (2007) claim that adjectives and
adverbs (chosen based on the proposed adverb
scoring technique) give much better results than
adjectives alone; Taboada et al (2011) show that
such lexical items as nouns and verbs (not only
adjectives and adverbs) can also carry important
semantic polarity information.
Ding and Liu (2007) argue that semantic orien-
tation is content dependent task and words alone
are not sufficient sentiment indicators thus incor-
porate them into the set of linguistic rules used in
classification; Choi and Cardie (2008) use heuris-
tics based on the compositional semantics (consid-
ering the effect of interactions among the words)
and achieve better results over the methods not
incorporating it; Taboada et al (2011) take into
account valence shifters (intensifiers, downtoners,
negation and irrealis markers) that influence the
polarity of the neighboring words for English;
Kuznetsova et al (2013) ? for Russian.
An alternative for the knowledge-based meth-
ods is machine learning that in turn can be grouped
into supervised and clustering techniques. Cluster-
ing is rarely used due to the low accuracy, but the
drawback of supervised machine learning (that we
will further focus on) is that for model creation a
training dataset (with manually pre-assigned sen-
timent class labels) is required.
The main issue for supervised machine learning
techniques is proper selection of features. Nev-
ertheless, the most basic approach remains bag-
of-words interpretation. Pang et al (2002) show
that bag-of-words beat other feature types (based
on token bigrams, parts-of-speech information and
word position in the text) with Support Vector
Machine (SVM) method. But on the contrary,
Dave et al (2003) report that token n-grams (up
to trigrams) can improve the performance com-
pared with simple unigrams; Cui et al (2006) with
higher order token n-grams (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) and
Passive Aggressive classifier outperform unigrams
and bigrams; Pak and Parubek (2011) with token
bigrams and Na??ve Bayes Multinomial method
outperform both token unigrams and trigrams.
Dave et al (2003) also report that stemming im-
proves accuracy compared with the bag-of-words
baseline, but other linguistic features (negation,
collocations of words, etc.) on the contrary ? hurt
the performance. Raaijmakers and Kraaij (2008)
use document-level character n-grams (n = 2, 3,
4, 5, 6) with SVM (geodesic kernel); Hartmann
et al (2011) claim that document-level character
n-grams used, namely, with Na??ve Bayes method
are even better choice than token n-grams (be-
cause the probability of finding character n-gram
is much higher and the relations between consec-
utive words are still considered).
Hybrid approaches combine both knowledge-
based and machine learning methods thus achiev-
ing superior performance. As it is demonstrated
by Mullen and Collier (2004) using SVM and
combined token unigram features with those based
on favorability measures (for phrases, adjectives
and even knowledge of topic).
Sentiment classification results can be influ-
enced by pre-processing as well. E.g. Kennedy
and Inkpen (2006) claim that valence shifters and
Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) show that
discourse information incorporated into bag-of-
words improve classification accuracy both for
knowledge-based and SVM methods. But often
pre-processing techniques (such as emoticons re-
placement, negation treatment and stop words re-
moval) are selected without any considerations
(e.g. see in (Pak and Paroubek, 2011)).
Both knowledge-based and supervised machine
learning methods are domain-dependent (when
classifier trained in one domain can barely beat
the baseline in the other) and, moreover, domain-
sensitive. E.g. Aue and Gamon (2005) with
Na??ve Bayes and SVM classifiers show that differ-
ent types of features work better across different
domains; therefore usually methods are built for
the specific selected domain. Sometimes domain-
dependent problem is circumvented by extracting
related content with manually created rules (Wang
et al, 2012) or via machine learning: i.e. by
3
performing topicality classification at the first
step and sentiment afterwards (Hurst and Nigam,
2004). Read and Carroll (2009) solve domain-
depended problem by using special methodology
to build the classifiers that are robust across the
different domains.
Hence sentiment classification is domain and
task dependent problem. Moreover, the perfor-
mance of selected method can also depend on the
language. E.g. Boiy and Moens (2009) demon-
strate that the best accuracy with token unigrams
(augmented with linguistics features) is obtained
using Na??ve Bayes Multinomial for English, SVM
for Dutch and Maximum Entropy for French lan-
guage. Besides, some solutions are proposed for
multilingual texts as well, e.g. Cheng and Zhu-
lyn (2012) show that generalized bigram model
(especially suitable for the languages with a flexi-
ble word order) using Na??ve Bayes and logistic re-
gression classifiers can achieve high accuracy on
different Germanic, Roman and East Asian lan-
guages.
We cannot provide any example of experiments
based on sentiment classification for Lithuanian.
Consequentially, this paper is the first attempt at
finding an accurate sentiment classification ap-
proach (knowledge-based or machine learning) on
Lithuanian Internet comments. Experiments will
be performed with different pre-processing tech-
niques, lexicons, and feature types.
3 The Lithuanian Language
In this section we discuss Lithuanian language
properties focusing on those aspects (inflection
morphology, word derivation system and word or-
der in a sentence) that may be important in the sen-
timent classification task.
Lithuanian language has rich inflectional mor-
phology, more complex than Latvian or Slavic lan-
guages (Savickiene? et al, 2009). Adjectives are
inflected by 7 cases, 2 (+1) genders, 2 numbers,
5 degrees of comparison, and have 2 pronomi-
nal forms; adverbs ? by 5 degrees of comparison;
nouns ? by 7 cases, 2 (+1) genders and 2 numbers;
verbs ? by 3 moods, 4 tenses, 2 numbers, and 3
persons. Besides, verbs can have non-conjugative
forms (participles, adverbial participles, verbal ad-
verbs, and some forms of gerund) that can be in-
flected by tense, case, gender, number, and have an
active or passive forms. Various inflection forms
in Lithuanian language are expressed by the dif-
ferent endings (and suffixes), moreover, e.g. nouns
have 12 different inflection paradigms; adjectives
? 9.
Lithuanian language has rich word derivation
system. 78 suffixes are used to derive diminutives
and hypocoristic words (Ulvydas, 1965), that are
especially frequent in spoken language; 25 pre-
fixes are used for the nouns; 19 ? for the verbs;
and 3 (+4 in dialects) ? for the adjectives and
adjectival adverbs. Suffixes and prefixes change
the meaning, e.g. suffix ?-iaus-? change ?geras?
(good) to ?geriausias? (the best) (by the way, the
ending has to be adjusted to the new suffix, there-
fore ?-as? is replaced by ?-ias?); prefix ?nu-?
and reflexive participle ?-si-? change ?s?neke?ti? (to
talk) to ?nusis?neke?ti? (to blunder out). Prefixes in
Lithuanian can also be used to derive phrasal verbs
(e.g. from ?eiti? (to go) to ?i?eiti? (to go in), ?is?eiti?
(to go out), etc.) and negative words.
The particle ?ne-? (no, not) or ?nebe-? (no
longer) giving to the words (adjectives, adjecti-
val adverbs, adverbial adverbs, nouns, verbs and
all their non-conjugative forms) an opposite mean-
ing is attached to them as a prefix: ?geras? (good)
? ?negeras? (not good); ?skaisc?iai? (brightly) ?
?nebeskaisc?iai? (no longer brightly); ?se?kme?? (a
fortune) ? ?nese?kme?? (a misfortune); ?be?gti? (to
run) ? ?nebebe?gti? (no longer to run); etc.
But if particle ?ne?, ?nebe? or ?ne?ra? (no, not)
expresses contradiction, it is written separately
(e.g. in ?jis neblogas? (he is not bad) ?ne? goes
as the prefix, but in ?jis ne blogas, o geras? (he is
not bad, but good) ?ne? goes separately.
The difference between English and Lithuanian
is that a negative idea in English is expressed by
only one negative word such as nothing, nobody,
never, whereas in Lithuanian such sentence must
contain two negated words, e.g. ?niekas gerai
nez?aidz?ia? (nobody plays well) word-to-word
translation is (nobody well not plays); ?niekada
nesakyk niekada? (never say never) word-to-word
translation is (never not say never).
The word order in Lithuanian sentences is free,
but it performs notional function, i.e. sentences
are grammatically correct regardless of the word
order, but the meaning (things that are highlighted)
can differ. E.g. whereas in ?tu esi labai geras? (you
are very good) intensifier ?labai? (very) is high-
lighted but in ?tu esi geras labai? (you are very
good) adjective ?geras? (good) is highlighted, thus
the first phrase gets higher positive intensiveness.

4 Methodology
4.1 Dataset
The dataset used in our sentiment classification
task contains online Internet comments to articles
crawled from the largest Lithuanian daily newspa-
per Lietuvos rytas (2013). These comments reflect
people?s opinions about the topical events in do-
mestic and foreign politics, sport, etc.
All Internet comments were manually labeled
as positive, negative or neutral. The decision about
the class label was based on a mutual agreement
of two human-experts. Efforts were made to fo-
cus solely on each comment, but known topic and
previous posts could still influence experts? deci-
sion. Ambiguous comments were discarded thus
leaving only single-labeled ones. Negative class
strongly dominated the others. To maintain bal-
anced class distribution the amount of comments
(treated as instances in the classification process)
belonging to the different classes was equalized by
discarding redundant instances. See statistics of
the dataset in Table 1.

stances

Neutral 1,500 13,165 4,039
Total 4,500 38,621 15,008
Table 1: Dataset statistics: the numbers were dis-
carded; tokens (words) were transformed to lower-
case.
The dataset contains texts representing informal
Lithuanian language, i.e. texts are full of slang,
foreign language insertions, and barbarisms. Be-
sides, in the texts are a lot of typographical and
grammatical errors. Moreover, Lithuanian lan-
guage uses Latin script supplemented with diacrit-
ics, but in informal texts, diacritics (a?, c?, e?, e?, i?,
s?, u?, u?, z?) are very often replaced with matching
Latin letters (a, c, e, e, i, s, u, u, z).
4.2 Classification methods
Sentiment classification task has never been
solved for Lithuanian; therefore it is unclear which
method could be the most suitable for the given
dataset. Consequentially, in this research we will
compare two different classification approaches ?
knowledge-based and machine learning ? apply-
ing them on the informal texts.
The keystone of our knowledge-based approach
is the lexicon that is applied to recognize senti-
ment words in the text. In our experiments we
used two lexicons (see Table 2): manually labeled
and automatically augmented one. Both lexicons
are composed of 4 dictionaries: for adjectives, ad-
verbs, nouns and verbs, respectively. Only lem-
mas (main words? forms containing ending and
suffices/prefixes) are stored in the dictionaries.
The candidates for the first lexicon were
extracted from 1 million running words
taken from Vytautas Magnus University Cor-
pus (Marcinkevic?iene?, 2000). These texts repre-
sent standard Lithuanian and were taken from six
domains: fiction, legal texts, national newspapers,
parliamentary transcripts, local newspapers, and
popular periodicals. Words were transformed
into their lemmas using Lithuanian part-of-speech
tagger and lemmatizer Lemuoklis (Zinkevic?ius,
2000); (Daudaravic?ius et al, 2007) and trans-
ferred to the dictionaries containing appropriate
parts-of-speech. Words in the first lexicon were
manually labeled with their polarity values (-3/3
means that the word is strongly negative/positive;
-2/2 ? moderately negative/positive; -1/1 ? weakly
negative/positive; 0 ? neutral). The decision was
taken by mutual agreement of two human-experts
that made efforts not to bind to the specific use
cases, but consider only the most common sense
of each word. The second lexicon was created by
automatically augmenting the first one with the
synonyms taken from Lithuanian WordNet (2013).
Words from the manually labeled lexicon were
used as the pre-selected ?seeds? to search for the
synonyms that automatically obtained the same
polarity value and were added to the appropriate
dictionaries.
Semantic orientation of each instance was de-
termined by summing the polarity values of recog-
nized sentiment words in the lemmatized texts. If
total polarity value was positive (> 0), the instance
was classified as positive; if negative (< 0) ? as
negative; if zero (= 0) ? as neutral. E.g. ?Filmas
labai puikus? (The film is great) would be clas-
sified as positive, because valueOf (?Filmas?)=0
and valueOf (?puikus?)=3, thus 0 + 3 = 3 > 0.
As the alternative for knowledge-based method
we used two machine learning methods ? i.e. Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM), introduced by Cortes
and Wapnik (1995) and Na??ve Bayes Multinomial
(NBM), introduced by Lewis and Gale (1994).

Table 2: Dictionaries statistics: the first value in
each cell represents the number of items in manu-
ally labeled lexicon; the second ? augmented with
WordNet.
SVM is one of the most popular techniques for
text classification, because it can cope with high
dimensional feature spaces (e.g. 15,008 word fea-
tures in our dataset); sparseness of feature vec-
tors (e.g. among 15,008, each instance would have
only ?3.34 non-zero word feature values); and in-
stances do not sharing any common features (com-
mon for short texts, e.g. average length of in-
stance in our dataset is ?8.58 words). Besides
SVM does not perform aggressive feature selec-
tion which may result in a loss of information.
NBM method is also often used for text clas-
sification tasks (mostly due its simplicity): Na??ve
Bayes assumption of feature independence allows
parameters of each feature to be learned sepa-
rately. It performs especially well when the num-
ber of features is large. Besides, it is reported
(e.g. by Pak and Parubek (2011)) that NBM can
even outperform popular SVM in sentiment clas-
sification tasks.
In our experiments we used SMO kernel for
SVM and NBM implementations in WEKA (Hall
et al, 2009) machine learning toolkit, version 3.61.
All parameters were set to their default values.
4.3 Experimental setup
Before classification experiments tokens (i.e.
words) in the dataset were pre-processed using dif-
ferent techniques. Knowledge-based method re-
quired lemmatization, whereas for machine learn-
1http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/.
ing methods lemmatization was optional. De-
spite that lemmatizer can solve disambiguation
problems and achieve ?0.94 accuracy on norma-
tive Lithuanian texts (Rimkute? and Daudaravic?ius,
2007); it could not recognize even ?0.25 of words
in our dataset.
Other optional pre-processing techniques in-
volved emoticons replacement with appropriate
sentiment words; Lithuanian diacritics replace-
ments with appropriate Latin letters; and stop
words removal.
Emoticons replacement demonstrated positive
effect on English (Read, 2005) and triggered us
to create such list for Lithuanian. The list contains
32 sentiment words (written in lemmas) with their
appropriate and commonly used emoticon equiv-
alents2. Thus, e.g. ?:-)? would be replaced by
?laimingas? (happy).
Words with replaced Lithuanian diacritics can
neither be found in the dictionaries, nor recog-
nized by the Lithuanian lemmatizer and therefore
require special treatment. Whereas tools able to
restore Lithuanian diacritics are not yet available,
we have chosen opposite way by replacing all dia-
critics with matching Latin letters in the text, dic-
tionaries and emoticons list and in such a way de-
creasing the number of unrecognized words (for
knowledge-based method) and the sparseness of
feature vector (for machine learning methods).
Stop words removal cannot affect the perfor-
mance of knowledge-based method, but it can
decrease the sparseness of the data for machine
learning techniques. In our experiments we used
stop words list with excluded interjections, be-
cause Spencer and Uchyigit (2012) showed that
interjections are strong indicators of subjectivity.
Compulsory pre-processing steps included
transformation of letters into lower-case, digits
and punctuation removal. Statistics demonstrating
the effect of different pre-processing techniques
on the dataset are presented in Table 3.
Pre-processing was performed in such an or-
der that previous steps could not harm following
ones, thus lemmatization was performed before
diacritics replacement, punctuation removal was
performed after emoticons replacement, etc.
Knowledge-based method was evaluated using
different combinations of dictionaries, whereas
machine learning method ? different types of fea-
tures: token unigrams (the most common case);

token unigrams plus bigrams, i.e. token unigrams
complemented with token bigrams (higher order
n-grams sometimes outperform token unigrams);
token lemmas (strongly recommended for highly-
inflective languages); document-level character
4-grams (this type was reported as the best
for Lithuanian topic classification by Kapoc?iu?te?-
Dzikiene? et al (2012)).

value in each cell represents the number of all to-
kens, the second ? distinct tokens. See Table 1 for

We expect the following statements to be con-
firmed experimentally: 1) emoticons replacement
should increase the results since they usually re-
flect emotional state of the person; 2) diacrit-
ics replacement or lemmatization should improve
the results by decreasing data sparseness and the
number of unrecognized words; 3) all dictionaries
should give better results for the knowledge-based
method because contain more sentiment informa-
tion; 4) machine learning methods should out-
perform knowledge-based approach because sen-
timents can be expressed in more complex ways.
5 Results
Accuracies (the number of correctly classified in-
stances divided by all instances) of previously de-
scribed experiments are summarized in Figure 1 ?
Figure 3.
Figure 1 summarizes the results obtained with
the knowledge-based method. Figure 2 summa-
rizes the results obtained with SVM method, Fig-
ure 3 ? with NBM. 10-fold cross-validation was
used in all experiments with machine learning
methods.
6 Discussion
Since the balanced class distribution is maintained
(see Table 1), both majority (probability to belong
only to a major class) and random (the sum of
squared probabilities of all classes) baselines are
equal to 0.333. Figure 1 ? Figure 3 show that ob-
tained classification results are above the baseline.
The best results using knowledge-based method
are achieved with emoticons and diacritics re-
placement, as expected (see Section 4.3), but
emoticons replacement is more effective.
Augmented lexicon slightly outperforms manu-
ally labeled. Besides, adjectives, nouns and verbs
improve the classification results for knowledge-
based approach, but adverbs worsen it. Bad per-
formance of adverbs contradicts our expectations.
Analysis of erroneous cases revealed that very
strong negative adverbs (used in slang) such as
?baisiai? (terribly), ?z?iauriai? (brutally), etc. fol-
lowed by the positive adjectives such as ?geras?
(good), ?nuostabus? (wonderful) become positive
intensifiers. Moreover, very often adverbs are
found in the context does not expressing any senti-
ment at all, e.g. ?gerai? (well) in ?gerai pasakyta?
(well said) should not be treated as positive word.
The results obtained with different machine
learning methods ? SVM and NBM are very con-
tradictory and not always correspond to our ex-
pectations (see Section 4.3). In general the best
feature type for SVM is either token unigrams or
token lemmas; for NBM ? token unigrams plus bi-
grams, but token lemmas is the second best result.
Longer phrases (based on token bigrams) increase
the sparseness of the data that seems to be harm-
ful for SVM method, which does not perform ag-
gressive feature selection. Whereas NBM is not as
sensitive to it, token unigrams plus bigrams (car-
rying more sentiment information) give the best
accuracy.
For both machine learning methods token lem-
mas are effective enough. The main problem is
that Lithuanian lemmatizer could not recognize
even a quarter of all words in the dataset, thus it
can be assumed that this feature type could give
even better results if lemmatizer would cope with
informal Lithuanian language as well.
Results obtained by machine learning meth-
ods show that document-level character 4-grams
(giving the best results for topic classification on
Lithuanian texts) are not effective for sentiment
classification. Character n-grams not only in-
crease the sparseness, but result in a loss of im-
portant information about Lithuanian suffixes and
prefixes. E.g. ?gera? (good) and ?negera? (not

good) contain the same 4 characters ?gera?, but
prefix ?ne-? reverses the polarity.
As presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3 emoti-
cons and diacritics replacement positively affect
classification results, but the effect is much weaker
compared to the knowledge-based approach. In
general, for SVM there is no single pre-processing
technique that could significantly stand out from
the rest, while for NBM diacritics replacement
is the best one, stop words removal is the worst.
It can be assumed that despite stop words seem
unimportant; they still carry sentiment informa-
tion, especially significant using token bigrams.
As expected (see Section 4.3), machine learn-
ing methods significantly outperform knowledge-
based. One of the main reasons is that the lexicons
are not adjusted to a specific domain. Our goal was
not to achieve as high accuracy as possible, but to
determine a real potential of such method on in-
formal Lithuanian texts. The analysis of erroneous
cases revealed that adjectives, nouns and verbs are
not the only sentiment indicators, e.g. interjection
?valio!? (hurray!) in ?valio! Auksas!? (hurray!
Gold!) can express positive sentiment also.
Besides, diacritics replacement is still a consid-
erable problem: e.g. whereas lexicon contains
?s?aunus? (cool, in masculine gender); the same
word with replaced diacritics in feminine gender
?sauni? will neither be recognized by lemmatizer,
nor found in the lexicon with replaced diacritics.
The best result with knowledge-based method
exceeds baseline by 0.156; with machine learning
? by 0.346, but they are still low compared to the
results obtained on English texts. Analysis of er-
roneous cases revealed that classifiers mostly fail
due to the language variations when sentiments
are expressed implicitly and require special treat-
ment considering informal Lithuanian language
specifics.
7 Conclusion and perspectives
In this paper we are solving Internet comments
sentiment classification task for Lithuanian, using
two different approaches: knowledge-based and
machine learning.
Adjectives, nouns and verbs (excluding ad-
verbs) are the most important sentiment indica-
tors for the knowledge-based approach that was
significantly outperformed by the machine learn-
ing methods. The best accuracy 0.679 is obtained
using Na??ve Bayes Multinomial with token uni-
grams plus bigrams as features and diacritics re-
placement as pre-processing technique.
In the future research we are planning to per-
form detailed class-wise error analysis that could
help to find the solutions decreasing the number of
erroneous cases. Besides, it would be interesting
to experiment with the implicitly expressed senti-
ments.
