Abstract
We present a method of evaluating the imme-
diate performance impact of user state mis-
classifications in spoken dialogue systems.
We illustrate the method with a tutoring sys-
tem that adapts to student uncertainty over and
above correctness. First we define a rank-
ing of user states representing local perfor-
mance. Second, we compare user state trajec-
tories when the first state is accurately clas-
sified versus misclassified. Trajectories are
quantified using a previously proposed met-
ric representing the likelihood of transitioning
from one user state to another. Comparison of
the two sets of trajectories shows whether user
state misclassifications change the likelihood
of subsequent higher or lower ranked states,
relative to accurate classification. Our tutoring
system results illustrate the case where user
state misclassification increases the likelihood
of negative performance trajectories as com-
pared to accurate classification.
1 Introduction
Spoken dialogue systems research has shown that
natural language processing errors can negatively
impact global system performance. For exam-
ple, automatic speech recognition errors have been
shown to negatively correlate with user satisfaction
surveys taken after the system interaction is over
(e.g., (Walker et al, 2000a; Pon-Barry et al, 2004)).
Automatic user state classification errors have
also been shown to negatively impact global per-
formance in spoken dialogue systems (e.g., (Pon-
Barry et al, 2006)). For example, in our prior work
with an uncertainty-adaptive spoken dialogue com-
puter tutoring system, we found that recognizing and
adapting to the user?s state of uncertainty, over and
above his/her state of correctness, significantly im-
proved global learning over all users (as measured
by tests taken before and after the system interac-
tion). However, this was only true when the user
uncertainty was manually labeled during the inter-
action by an unseen human ?wizard of oz? (Forbes-
Riley and Litman, 2011b); it was not true when the
uncertainty was automatically labeled by the system.
Further analysis showed that uncertainty classifica-
tion errors largely accounted for the global perfor-
mance decrease in our fully automated system. In
particular, only a small proportion of users? actual
uncertainty was being accurately classified by the
system (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).1
The question we address in this study is how to
analyze the impact of automatic user state classifi-
cation errors when analyzing performance at a local
level. In particular, is there a measurable local per-
formance difference when one compares what hap-
pens in a dialogue after a turn is accurately classi-
fied versus misclassified? We show here how user
state trajectories can be used to answer this ques-
tion. First, a ranking of user states is defined (Sec-
tion 3.1). Second, user state trajectories are com-
puted from two sets of system dialogue: one in

?(in)correct? and ?(un)certain? can have multiple interpreta-
tions. To avoid confusion, we reserve these terms in this paper
only to refer to the semantic content and affective/attitudinal ex-
pression of user answers (respectively). When referring to the
NLP performance of our system, we use the terms ?accurately
classified? and ?misclassified?.

which the user state of interest is accurately clas-
sified in the first turn in the trajectory, and another
in which it is misclassified (Section 3.2). Trajec-
tories are quantified as the likelihood of transition-
ing from one user state to another (D?Mello et al,
2007). Comparison of the two sets of trajectories in-
dicates how user state misclassifications change the
relative likelihood of subsequent states. Transitions
to higher ranked states indicate improved local per-
formance while transitions to lower ranked states in-
dicate decreased local performance.
In our research, we are interested in this question
because we hypothesize that accurate and inaccurate
user state classification in our uncertainty-adaptive
system yielded immediate differences in user behav-
ior. We further hypothesize that our uncertainty-
adaptive system had a negative immediate impact
on the user?s state when (un)certainty was misclas-
sified, as compared to when (un)certainty was ac-
curately classified. Our user state trajectory results
support these hypotheses. We find that (un)certainty
misclassifications increased the likelihood of transi-
tioning to the lowest ranked user state in the next
turn. In contrast, accurate (un)certainty classifica-
tion yielded an increased likelihood of more positive
performance trajectories (Section 4).
More generally, this question is relevant to other
automatically classified user states and other types
of dialogue systems, whenever the goal is to un-
derstand the immediate impact of user state classi-
fication errors on user behavior during the dialogue
(Sections 3.1 and Section 5).
2 The System and Dialogues
We apply this local performance analysis to dia-
logues between college students and our fully auto-
mated spoken dialogue tutoring system, ITSPOKE.2
Two sets of dialogues are used here, which come
from two versions of ITSPOKE: the uncertainty-
adaptive and non-adaptive versions. Both ver-
sions automatically classify user (un)certainty and
(in)correctness for each turn. However, the non-
adaptive version?s responses are based only on
(in)correctness, while the uncertainty-adaptive ver-
sion provides an uncertainty adaptation to uncer-

tain+correct answers. All dialogues were collected
in our prior experiment comparing global learn-
ing across the uncertainty-adaptive and non-adaptive
system versions (see Section 1). The uncertainty-
adaptive system yielded 120 dialogues (1957 student
turns) from 24 subjects. The non-adaptive system
yielded 125 dialogues (2065 student turns) from 25
subjects. Our analysis will focus on the dialogues
from the uncertainty-adaptive system (Section 4.1);
the dialogues from the non-adaptive system will be
used for comparison (Section 4.2).
Briefly, ITSPOKE tutors 5 physics problems (one
per dialogue), in a Tutor Question - Student Answer
- Tutor Response format. The tutor questions seri-
ally present topics needed to solve each problem; ad-
jacent questions concern identical or closely related
topics. After each tutor question, the student answer
is digitized from head-mounted microphone input
and sent to the Sphinx2 recognizer, which yields an
automatic transcript. The answer?s (in)correctness is
then automatically classified based on this transcript,
using the TuTalk semantic analyzer (Jordan et al,
2007). Simultaneously, the answer?s (un)certainty
is automatically classified by inputting features of
the speech signal, the automatic transcript, and the
dialogue context into a logistic regression model.3
All natural language processing components were
trained using prior ITSPOKE corpora.
The dialogue manager determines the appropriate
tutor response and sends it to the Cepstral text-to-
speech system. The uncertainty-adaptive and non-
adaptive system versions give the same response to
incorrect answers (regardless of (un)certainty): in-
correctness feedback (e.g., ?That?s not right?) fol-
lowed by additional remedial content to help stu-
dents understand why their answer was incorrect.
Both versions also give the same response to cer-
tain+correct answers: correctness feedback only
(e.g., ?That?s right?). The two versions differ in their
response to uncertain+correct answers. The non-
adaptive version responds with correctness feed-
back only, while the uncertainty-adaptive version re-
sponds with correctness feedback followed by addi-
tional remedial content to help students resolve their
uncertainty. This uncertainty adaptation is based on

and energy features as well as tutor question and user gender,
and is described further in (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).

compare to that of his keys?
student-automatic1: his also the is the same as that of his keys points force (certain+incorrect)
student-manual1: his velocity is the same as that of his keys while he?s holding them (uncertain+correct)
tutor2: Actually... Their velocities must be the same, because the man?s holding his keys, so they?re not moving with
respect to each other. [...] What are the forces exerted on the man after he releases his keys?

of the man. It?s always present when an object is in earth?s gravitational field. So what?s the direction of the force of
gravity on the man (e.g., vertically up)?
Figure 1: Annotated Dialogue Example Showing Uncertainty Adaptation and User State Classifications
prior tutoring research, which argues that incorrect-
ness and uncertainty are both signals of a ?learn-
ing impasse?, i.e., an opportunity to better learn the
material (VanLehn et al, 2003). Our uncertainty
adaptation only provides additional remedial con-
tent after the uncertain+correct impasse, because in-
correctness impasses (uncertain and certain) already
receive remedial content from the non-adaptive sys-
tem. It is assumed that this content helps resolve
both incorrectness and uncertainty (when present).
After the experiment, each student answer
(turn) was manually transcribed and labeled for
(un)certainty and (in)correctness. One labeler
performed the annotation based on schemes devel-
oped and evaluated on prior ITSPOKE corpora,
where this labeler and another labeler displayed
interannotator reliability of 0.85 and 0.62 Kappa
on (in)correctness and (un)certainty, respec-
tively (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).4 Com-
parison of the automatic and manual labels yielded
84.7% accuracy for automatic (in)correctness
classification and 80.3% accuracy for auto-
matic (un)certainty classification. However, the
(un)certainty model had an uncertainty recall of
only about 20%, while the (in)correctness model
had a correctness recall of about 80% (Forbes-Riley
and Litman, 2011a).5
4Because these evaluations showed that this trained labeler
could reliably annotate (un)certainty and (in)correctness in IT-
SPOKE dialogues, no further evaluations were performed.
5The lower recall for predicting uncertainty is neverthe-
Figure 1 illustrates ITSPOKE?s natural language
processing components and the two system versions.
The first answer is classified as certain+incorrect
(student-automatic1) but manually labeled as un-
certain+correct (student-manual1); the manual and
automatic transcripts are also substantially differ-
ent. Because this answer was misclassified as in-
correct, both versions give the same response (tu-
tor2). The second answer is accurately classified as
uncertain+correct. The non-adaptive system thus ig-
nores the uncertainty and only provides correctness
feedback (non-adaptive-tutor3), while the adaptive
system responds with correctness feedback and ad-
ditional remedial content to help resolve the uncer-
tainty (uncertainty-adaptive-tutor3).
3 Local Performance Evaluation
Here we discuss how to evaluate the local impact of
user state misclassification in dialogue systems.
3.1 Defining a User State Severity Ranking
Building on tutoring research that views both uncer-
tainty and incorrectness as signals of learning im-
passes (Section 2), we previously defined a sever-
ity ranking for the four impasse states correspond-
ing to all combinations of binary (in)correctness
less higher than always predicting no uncertainty (a majority
class baseline has 0% recall), and is on par with prior work in
affect-adaptive tutoring systems, e.g. (Walonoski and Heffer-
nan, 2006); in general affective systems research has found it
difficult to accurately predict positive occurrences of affect.
218
Impasse State: certain+incorrect uncertain+incorrect uncertain+correct certain+correct
Severity: most less least none
Figure 2: User Impasse State Severity Ranking
and (un)certainty (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).
This ranking, shown in Figure 2, reflects the as-
sumption that a student must perceive an impasse in
order to resolve it. A state of uncertainty reflects this
awareness. Therefore, the most severe type of learn-
ing impasse occurs when a student is incorrect but
not aware of it. Impasse states of decreasing sever-
ity occur when the student is incorrect but aware that
s/he might be, and correct but believes s/he may not
be, respectively. No impasse exists when a student
is correct and not uncertain about it.
In our prior work, this ranking of user states was
independently validated by showing that average im-
passe state severity negatively correlates with global
learning gain in our system dialogues (Forbes-Riley
and Litman, 2011a). In other words, a higher pro-
portion of user states with less severe or no impasses
directly relates to higher global learning gain.
More generally, the idea of ranking user states in
terms of those that do or do not represent communi-
cation impasses applies to other dialogue system do-
mains and other user state dimensions as well. For
example, in information-seeking domains, frustra-
tion and anger are common affective states whose
occurrence during the dialogue signals severe com-
munication problems (Batliner et al, 2003), while
hang-ups and turns requesting a human operator are
other types of user states whose occurrence dur-
ing the dialogue signals severe communication prob-
lems (Walker et al, 2000b).
Moreover, state trajectories can be used to repre-
sent abstractions over other types of user (or system)
behaviors. In our tutoring system analysis, repre-
senting user states in terms of only (un)certainty and
(in)correctness is an abstraction that we find useful
for analyzing impasse trajectories. However, dur-
ing run-time, a finite-state dialogue manager con-
sisting of 142 states actually controls the system?s
operation, and uses many other features besides user
uncertainty and incorrectness to determine the sys-
tem?s response (e.g. the physics concepts related to
the current system question, the history of prior stu-
dent answers to similar questions, etc.). Any of these
states could be analyzed as well to understand their
local performance impact, as could their analogs in
other system domains. For example, in a train di-
alogue system, while the actual state representation
used during operation could be quite complex, for
a trajectory analysis a simpler representation could
be suitable, one which tracks whether the system
knows the values of the n attributes needed to query
the database. The state ranking in this case would
be over equivalence classes of states: states with n
attributes known > states with n-1 attributes known
> ... > initial state with 0 attributes known.
3.2 Computing User State Trajectories
Local trajectories of user states during a dialogue
can be computed as the likelihood of transitioning
from the user state in turn n to the user state in turn
n+1. Here we use D?Mello et al?s metric, transition
likelihood L (D?Mello et al, 2007).
Transition likelihood L is computed as shown be-
low, where n refers to the impasse state in turn n
and n+1 refers to the impasse state in turn n+1. As
shown, L is computed as the conditional probabil-
ity that the user state in turn n+1 will occur given
that the user state in turn n has occurred, adjusted
for the base rate of occurrence of the user state in
turn n+1. The denominator normalizes the result so
that L ranges from -? to 1. L=1 indicates that n+1
always follows n over and above the probability of
n+1 occurring. L=0 indicates that n+1 follows n at
the chance level. L<0 indicate that the likelihood of
n+1 following n is much lower than the base rate of
n+1 occurring.6
L(n?n+1) = P (n+1|n)?P (n+1)1?P (n+1)
Transition likelihood L has previously been used
to compute the likelihood of transitioning from one
affective state to another (e.g., from confusion to

ity of one user state following another, is equivalent to Kappa
in computing agreement among annotators after adjusting for
chance (D?Mello et al, 2007).
219
frustration) in a single set of dialogues between
student and computer tutor (D?Mello et al, 2007).
Transition likelihood L has also been used to com-
pare how the likelihoods of transitioning from one
affective state to another vary across two differ-
ent sets of dialogues collected with two different
versions of an affect-adaptive tutoring system (Mc-
Quiggan et al, 2008). Our analysis is based on
this analysis, but extends it in three ways: 1) our
transitions involve complex user states composed of
two dimensions ((un)certainty and (in)correctness),
2) the user states in our transitions are ranked to
enable a local performance analysis, 3) our perfor-
mance analysis is applied to the question of how user
state misclassification impacts local performance,
by comparing transition likelihoods after accurate
and inaccurate user state classifications.
In this prior work and in our work, likelihoods
for each transition are computed for each user (over
all dialogues of a user). ANOVAs with post-hoc
pairwise tests can then determine if there were sig-
nificant differences between all possible transitions
from the current user state in turn n.
To investigate how user state misclassifications
impact local performance, two user trajectories are
computed per user for each n?n+1 transition: one
when the manual and automatic user state labels
for turn n agreed, and another when they did not
agree. In both cases, using the manual label for turn
n+1 enables the true final user state to be compared
across the two sets of trajectories. Comparison of
the final state in the two sets of trajectories indicates
how user state misclassifications change the relative
likelihood of the subsequent user states. Transitions
to higher ranked states indicate improved local per-
formance while transitions to lower ranked states in-
dicate decreased local performance.
4 Impact of User State Misclassifications
in Uncertainty-Adaptive ITSPOKE
We now apply this analysis to the uncertainty-
adaptive ITSPOKE dialogues, to investigate how
user state misclassification impacts the local perfor-
mance of the uncertainty adaptation.
Since the complex user state of uncertain+correct
triggers the uncertainty adaptation, misclassifying
(un)certainty or (in)correctness can potentially im-
pact the local performance of the adaptation. How-
ever, as noted in Section 2, we previously found
that uncertainty misclassifications in our system
were more severe than correctness misclassifica-
tions. Thus, to streamline our analysis and avoid
data skew issues, we focus on how (un)certainty
misclassifications in manually labeled correct an-
swers impact our local performance trajectories.
There are 1270 manually labeled correct turns in
the dialogues collected with uncertainty-adaptive
ITSPOKE. In the dialogues collected with non-
adaptive ITSPOKE (which we will use for compari-
son), there are 1353 manually labeled correct turns.
We hypothesize that when (un)certainty misclas-
sification in correct answers causes the uncertainty
adaptation to be erroneously triggered or blocked,
we will see a negative performance impact, in terms
of an increased likelihood of transitioning to a more
severe impasse state when uncertainty is misclassi-
fied as compared to when it is accurately classified.
4.1 Uncertainty-Adaptive ITSPOKE Results
Accurate Uncertainty Classification: Figure 3
presents descriptive statistics for the likelihood (L)
that a manually labeled uncertain+correct answer
accurately classified as uncertain in turn n will tran-
sition to each of the four manually labeled impasse
states in turn n+1. As noted in Section 3.2, L=0 indi-
cates that the transition likelihood is equal to chance,
while L>0 and L<0 indicate likelihoods greater and
less than chance, respectively.
An ANOVA indicated that there were statistically
significant differences among the likelihoods in Fig-
ure 3 (F(3,56)=3.87, p=.02). The most likely transi-
tions are shown with stripes. Specifically, post-hoc
pairwise tests showed that in turn n+1, an uncer-
tain+incorrect answer (p<.01) or uncertain+correct
answer (p=.02) is significantly more likely than a
certain+correct answer (but are themselves equally
likely). In addition, an uncertain+incorrect answer
is significantly more likely than a certain+incorrect
answer (p=.05), in turn n+1. A dialogue example of
the most likely transition after accurately classified
uncertainty is shown in Figure 5, where it is com-
pared with the misclassified minimal pair in Figure 6
(see Appendix).
These results indicate that accurately classifying
(and thus accurately adapting to) uncertain+correct
220
Figure 3: Turn n? Turn n+1 Transition Likelihoods (L)
after a manually labeled uncertain+correct answer in turn
n is accurately classified as uncertain and receives the un-
certainty adaptation
answers is most likely to yield continued uncertainty
(regardless of correctness) in turn n+1. Prior re-
search (Craig et al, 2004; Kort et al, 2001) has
shown that uncertainty and questioning are positive
and crucial aspects of the learning process. The
continued uncertainty suggests that the uncertainty
adaptation keeps the student engaged in the learn-
ing process, and the equal likelihood of correctness
or incorrectness accompanying this uncertainty sug-
gests that they have not yet unreservedly adopted ei-
ther the correct or incorrect line of reasoning about
the topic under discussion.
To determine whether any of these transitions are
directly tied to global performance, we computed
Pearson?s correlations over all students between the
percentage of each transition and global learning
gain.7 Interestingly, transitioning from an accu-
rately classified correct+uncertain answer to a cor-
rect+certain answer is negatively related to global
learning gain (R=-.458, p=.025). This indicates that
continued uncertainty after the uncertainty adapta-
tion is provided is more beneficial, in the long run,
than no uncertainty. No other trajectories are di-
rectly related to global learning. Although our prior
result, that average impasse severity negatively cor-
relates with global learning gain (Section 3.1), indi-
cates it is better from a global perspective for a stu-
dent to be in a state of no impasse (correct+certain),
it does not tell us the best way for the student to at-

tain this state. The results of our transition correla-
tions shed light on this - they tell us that transitioning
directly from correct+uncertain is not the best way
to attain the no impasse state. We hypothesize that
looking at wider transition windows (e.g., trigrams)
will shed light on what is the best way to attain this
state. For example, it may be that the best way to
transition to a state of no impasse is to do so after
sustained uncertainty (as in Figure 3).
Uncertainty Misclassification: Considering now
user state misclassifications, our results for accu-
rately classified uncertain+correct answers are in
sharp contrast to those for manually labeled uncer-
tain+correct answers misclassified as certain in turn
n. In particular, an ANOVA indicated that all manu-
ally labeled impasse states are equally likely in n+1
(F(3,88)=1.22, p=.32) after a misclassified uncer-
tain+correct answer.8
These results indicate that misclassifying (and
erroneously not adapting to) uncertain+correct an-
swers is as likely to have an immediate negative im-
pact on learning as it is to have a neutral or positive
impact. In particular, the misclassification is likely
to cause some students to transition from the least
severe impasse about the concept in turn n to the
most severe impasse about the concept in turn n+1.9
When they do not receive the uncertainty adaptation,
these students adopt an incorrect line of reasoning in
turn n+1, without any uncertainty about it at all.
As illustration, compare the example in Figure 5,
where uncertainty is accurately classified, with the
example in Figure 6, where uncertainty is misclas-
sified (see Appendix). As shown, the uncertainty in
student-manual1 signals that further explanation is
needed. When received (Figure 5) the student still
makes a math error on the next question, but s/he
appears to understand the task. In contrast, when the
uncertainty adaptation is erroneously not received
(Figure 6), there is no indication that the student?s
understanding has increased; s/he appears to be sim-
ply repeating the number 9.8 (a number which ap-
pears frequently in Newtonian physics). User uncer-
tainty misclassification in other domains could have

or correlations are discussed.

either address the same or closely related topics.
221
similar effects; in general, if a user is uncertain in
turn n about how to perform a task, and the system
moves on without supplying information to resolve
this uncertainty, there may be an immediate negative
impact if that knowledge is required or presupposed
again in turn n+1.
Accurate Certainty Classification: Turning now
to manually labeled certain+correct answers, Fig-
ure 4 presents descriptive statistics for the likelihood
that when accurately classified as certain in turn
n, certain+correct answers will transition to each
of the four manually labeled impasse states in turn
n+1. An ANOVA indicated that there were statisti-
cally significant differences among these likelihoods
(F(3,92)=17.96, p<.01). The most likely transitions
are shown with stripes. More specifically, post-hoc
pairwise tests showed that in turn n+1, a manually
labeled certain+correct answer is significantly more
likely than any other impasse state (p<.01), and all
other impasse states were equally likely. A dialogue
example of the most likely transition after accurately
classified certainty is shown in Figure 7, where it is
compared with the misclassified minimal pair in Fig-
ure 8 (see Appendix).
These results indicate that accurately classifying
and not adapting to certain+correct answers has an
immediate positive impact on the learning process,
by not introducing learning impasses about concepts
already understood. Note however that Pearson?s
correlations for these transitions showed no signif-
icant relation to global performance.
Certainty Misclassification: Again, our results
for accurately classified certain+correct answers are
in sharp contrast with those found for manually la-
beled certain+correct answers misclassified as un-
certain in turn n. An ANOVA indicated that all man-
ually labeled impasse states are equally likely in turn
n+1 (F(3,72)=0.33, p=.80). These results indicate
that misclassifying and erroneously adapting to cer-
tain+correct answers is as likely to have an imme-
diate negative impact on learning as it is to have a
neutral or positive impact. In particular, the misclas-
sification is likely to cause some students to tran-
sition from no impasse to the most severe impasse
state. When they erroneously receive the uncertainty
adaptation, these students go from no impasse at all
in turn n to an incorrect line of reasoning in turn n+1,
Figure 4: Turn n? Turn n+1 Transition Likelihoods (L)
after a manually labeled certain+correct answer in turn n
is accurately classified as certain and does not receive the
uncertainty adaptation
without any uncertainty about it at all.
As illustration, compare the example in Figure 7,
where certainty is accurately classified, with the ex-
ample in in Figure 8, where certainty is misclas-
sified (see Appendix). As shown, the certainty in
student-manual1 signals that no further explanation
is needed so the system can move on (Figure 7).
When the uncertainty adaptation is erroneously re-
ceived even though the student is certain (Figure 8),
this appears to have caused the student to stop pay-
ing close attention and thus provide an obviously in-
correct answer to an easy question. User certainty
misclassification in other domains could have simi-
lar effects; in general, if a user is already certain in
turn n about how to perform a task, and the system
?wastes? his/her time by resupplying information
that is already understood, there may be an imme-
diate negative impact in terms of loss of focus, dis-
engagement, or even decreased understanding, that
cause the task in turn n+1 to be performed incor-
rectly.
4.2 Comparing Non-Adaptive ITSPOKE
As a sanity check, we performed the same trajec-
tory analysis on the dialogues from the non-adaptive
version of the system. The purpose here was to con-
firm the presupposition of the above analysis, that
uncertainty-adaptive ITSPOKE was actually pro-
ducing different local behaviors than non-adaptive
ITSPOKE. In other words, since the non-adaptive
222
system ignores uncertainty, there should be no dif-
ference in transition likelihoods when uncertainty is
accurately classified versus when it is misclassified.
This expectation was borne out. ANOVAs indi-
cated that in the non-adaptive system, a manually
labeled uncertain+correct answer is equally likely
to transition to any of the four manually labeled
impasse states in turn n+1, regardless of whether
it was accurately classified as uncertain in turn n
(F(3,48)=0.25, p=.86) or misclassified as certain in
turn n (F(3,92)=0.07, p=.98). Thus as expected, un-
certain+correct answers in the non-adaptive system
pattern like uncertain+correct answers misclassified
as certain in the uncertainty-adaptive system. In
both cases, we see the same negative immediate per-
formance impact of not giving uncertain+correct an-
swers the uncertainty adaptation.
ANOVAs with post-hoc pairwise tests further in-
dicated that in the non-adaptive system, a manually
labeled certain+correct answer is significantly more
likely to transition to a certain+correct answer than
to any other manually labeled impasse state, regard-
less of whether it was accurately classified as certain
in turn n (ANOVA:(F(3,96)=20.81, p<.001), post-
hoc tests: p<.001) or misclassified as uncertain in
turn n (ANOVA:(F(3,80)=14.00, p<.001), post-hoc
tests: p<.001). Thus as expected, certain+correct
answers in the non-adaptive system pattern like ac-
curately classified certain+correct answers in the
uncertainty-adaptive system. In both cases, we see
the same positive immediate performance impact of
not giving manually labeled certain+correct answers
the uncertainty adaptation.
4.3 Comparing Local and Global Performance
Results
Finally, in analyses such as this one, comparing lo-
cal and global performance results can help pinpoint
specific areas for future system redesign. In our
case, this comparison suggests the most important
aspect to focus on with respect to improving our un-
certainty model.
In particular, as noted in Section 1, we previ-
ously found that the low uncertainty recall of our
system (approximately 20%) had a negative global
performance impact; mistaking so much true uncer-
tainty for certainty substantially reduced the amount
users learned (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).
We also showed in this prior work that mistaking
certainty for uncertainty did not negatively impact
the amount users learned. These results suggested
that the system should be less cautious in applying
the uncertainty-adaptive behavior; i.e., applying it
whenever there is some possibility that the user is ac-
tually uncertain, even if it means applying it to some
turns that are actually certain.
On the other hand, our local performance analy-
sis in this paper showed that (un)certainty misclas-
sification increased the likelihood of an immediate
negative impact on learning. These results suggest
that the system should be more cautious in applying
the uncertainty-adaptive behavior; i.e., only apply-
ing it when there is a high probability that the user
is actually uncertain.
Together these local and global results suggest
that we should focus on improving uncertainty re-
call without decreasing uncertainty precision, in our
uncertainty model. With this goal in mind, we are
currently exploring the use of features and methods
from recent INTERSPEECH emotion and paralin-
guistic challenges (Schuller et al, 2009; Schuller et
al., 2010).
5 Conclusion and Future Directions
This paper presents an approach for analyzing the
immediate impact of user state misclassifications in
dialogue systems. A ranking of user states is de-
fined, and then user state trajectories are compared
when the first state is accurately classified versus
misclassified. Trajectories are quantified using a
previously proposed metric representing the likeli-
hood of transitioning between states. Comparison
of the two sets of trajectories shows whether mis-
classifications change the likelihood of subsequent
higher or lower ranked states, relative to accurate
classification. We illustrated the approach with an
adaptive tutoring system that automatically detects
and adapts to student uncertainty.
As our results indicate, the approach can be used
to answer questions which global performance anal-
yses overlook. First, the analysis shows whether
user state misclassifications actually matter locally
- whether these errors have an immediate effect on
user behavior or not. Moreover, the analysis can de-
termine whether this effect is positive or negative or
223
neutral. In our tutoring system data, we found that
misclassifying user uncertainty had a negative im-
mediate impact on user behavior, relative to accurate
classification.
The analysis can also confirm that a dialogue in-
tervention actually changes user behaviors. In our
tutoring system data, we found that the adaptive sys-
tem yielded significantly different user state trajec-
tories than the non-adaptive system, even though,
as noted in Section 1, our prior global performance
analysis did not show any overall differences among
the global performance metrics that we examined
across the adaptive and non-adaptive systems.
In addition, the analysis can confirm that a dia-
logue intervention shifts user behaviors in the de-
sired direction. In our tutoring system data, we
found that the immediate effect of accurately adapt-
ing to uncertainty was most likely to be continued
uncertainty. Although the adaptation does not yield
an immediate transition to the highest ranked user
state, the outcome is clearly more positive than that
of ignoring uncertainty, which increases the likeli-
hood of transitioning to the lowest ranked user state.
Finally, the local performance results can shed
light on the steps needed to improve global perfor-
mance, by investigating how the two are related. In
our tutoring system data, we found that there is not a
one-to-one relationship between the most beneficial
local and global outcomes. In particular, transition-
ing directly to the highest ranked (no impasse) state
after receiving the uncertainty adaptation was neg-
atively correlated to global learning gain. We hy-
pothesized that looking at wider transition windows
(e.g., trigrams) will shed light on what is the best
local path to the highest ranked state.
We conclude by emphasizing that state trajecto-
ries can be used to represent abstractions over var-
ious types of user (or system) behaviors, in various
domains, whenever their local performance impact
is viewed as important to understand.

tutor1: If an object in freefall begins with a velocity of zero, what?ll its velocity be a second later? Please specify the
units too.
student-automatic1: 9.8 meters per second (uncertain+correct)
student-manual1: 9.8 meters per second?? (uncertain+correct)
tutor2: Fine. Because it?s in freefall, its acceleration is 9.8m/s2. This tells us that every second, its velocity increases
by 9.8 m/s. Therefore, at one second its velocity is 0 m/s, and a second later, its velocity is 9.8m/s. So, what?ll its
velocity be a second after that?
student-manual2: 18.6 meters per second?? (uncertain+incorrect)

tutor1: There?s only one horizontal force exerted on the truck during the collision with the car. What is it?
student-automatic1: impact force (uncertain+correct)
student-manual1: the impact force (certain+correct)
tutor2: Right. The problem statement says the car and the truck are both traveling in a straight horizontal line when
they collide. So the impact force of the truck on the truck must be in the horizontal direction. It also says they are
driving on a patch of frictionless ice when they collide. So there is no friction to take into account. This means that
the impact force is the only horizontal force on the truck. Now let?s find the forces exerted on the truck in the vertical
direction during the collision. First, what vertical force is always exerted on an object near the surface of the earth?
student-manual2: normal force (certain+incorrect)
