Abstract. Linguistic information can help improve evaluation of simi-
larity between documents; however, the kind of linguistic information to
be used depends on the task. In this paper, we show that distributions
of syntactic structures capture the way works are written and accurately
identify individual books more than 76% of the time. In comparison,
baseline features, e.g., tfidf-weighted keywords, function words, etc., give
an accuracy of at most 66%. However, testing the same features on au-
thorship attribution shows that distributions of syntactic structures are
less successful than function words on this task; syntactic structures vary
even among the works of the same author whereas features such as func-
tion words are distributed more similarly among the works of an author
and can more effectively capture authorship.
1 Introduction
Expression is an abstract concept that we define as ?the way people convey
particular content?. Copyrights protect an author?s expression of content where
content refers to the information contained in a work and expression refers to
the linguistic choices of authors in presenting this content. Therefore, capturing
expression is important for copyright infringement detection.
In this paper, we evaluate syntactic elements of expression in two contexts:
book recognition for copyright infringement detection and authorship attribu-
tion. Our first goal is to enable identification of individual books from their
expression of content, even when they share content, and even when they are
written by the same person. For this purpose, we use a corpus that includes
translations of the same original work into English by different people. For the
purposes of this study, we refer to the translations as books and an original work
itself as a title.
Given the syntactic elements of expression, our second goal is to test them on
authorship attribution, where the objective is to identify all works by a particu-
lar author. Our syntactic elements of expression capture differences in the way
people express content and could be useful for authorship attribution. However,
the experiments we present here indicate that syntactic elements of expression
are more successful at identifying expression in individual books while function
words are more successful at identifying authors.

2 Related Work
In text classification literature, similarity of works has been evaluated, for ex-
ample, in terms of genre, e.g., novels vs. poems, in terms of the style of au-
thors, e.g., Austen?s novels vs. Kipling?s novels, and in terms of topic, e.g., sto-
ries about earthquakes vs. stories about volcanoes. In this paper, we compare
several different language models in two different classification tasks: book recog-
nition based on similarity of expression, and authorship attribution. Authorship
attribution has been studied in the literature; however, evaluation of similar-
ity of expression, e.g., Verne?s 20000 Leagues vs. Flaubert?s Madame Bovary,
is a novel task that we endeavor to address as a first step towards copyright
infringement detection.
We define expression as ?the linguistic choices of authors in presenting con-
tent?: content of works and the linguistic choices made while presenting it to-
gether constitute expression. Therefore, capturing expression requires measuring
similarity of works in terms of both of these components.
To classify documents based on their content, most approaches focus on key-
words. Keywords contain information regarding the ideas and facts presented
in documents and, despite being ambiguous in many contexts, have been heav-
ily exploited to represent content. In addition to keywords, subject?verb and
verb?object relationships [12], noun phrases [12,13], synonym sets of words from
WordNet [12], semantic classes of verbs [12] from Levin?s studies [21], and proper
nouns have all been used to capture content.
Linguistic choices of authors have been studied in stylometry for authorship
attribution. Brinegar [7], Glover [9] and Mendenhall [22], among others, used
distribution of word lengths to identify authors, e.g., Glover and Hirst studied
distributions of two- and three-letter words [9]. Thisted et al [33] and Holmes [14]
studied the idea of richness of vocabulary and the rate at which new words are
introduced to the text. Many others experimented with distributions of sentence
lengths [9,18,24,30,31,32,38,40], sequences of letters [17,20], and syntactic classes
(part of speech) of words [9,20,19].
Mosteller and Wallace [25] studied the distributions of function words to
identify the authors of 12 unattributed Federalist papers. Using a subset of the
function words from Mosteller and Wallace?s work, Peng [26] showed that verbs
(used as function words, e.g., be, been, was, had) are important for differentiating
between authors. Koppel et al [19] studied the ?stability? of function words and
showed that the features that are most useful for capturing the style of authors
are ?unstable?, i.e., they can be replaced without changing the meaning of the
text. Koppel et al?s measure of stability identified function words, tensed verbs,
and some part-of-speech tag trigrams as unstable.
Syntactically more-informed studies of the writings of authors came from
diMarco and Wilkinson [39] who treated style as a means for achieving par-
ticular communicative goals and used parsed text to study the syntactic ele-
ments associated with each goal, e.g., clarity vs. obscurity. Adapting elements
from Halliday and Hasan [10,11], diMarco et al studied the use of cohesive el-
ements of text, e.g., anaphora and ellipsis, and disconnective elements of text,
A Comparative Study of Language Models for Book and Author Recognition 971
e.g., parenthetical constructions, as well as the patterns in the use of relative
clauses, noun embeddings, and hypotaxis (marked by subordinating conjunc-
tions) when authors write with different communicative goals.
Expression is related to both content and style. However, it is important to
differentiate expression from style. Style refers to the linguistic elements that,
independently of content, persist over the works of an author and has been widely
studied in authorship attribution. Expression involves the linguistic elements
that relate to how an author phrases particular content and can be used to
identify potential copyright infringement.
3 Syntactic Elements of Expression
We hypothesize that, given particular content, authors choose from a set of
semantically equivalent syntactic constructs to create their own expression of
it. As a result, different authors may choose to express the same content in
different ways. In this paper, we capture the differences in expression of authors
by studying [34,35,36]:
? sentence-initial and -final phrase structures that capture the shift in focus
and emphasis of a sentence due to reordered material,
? semantic classes and argument structures of verbs such as those used in
START for question answering [16] and those presented by Levin [21],
? syntactic classes of embedding verbs, i.e., verbs that take clausal arguments,
such as those studied by Alexander and Kunz [1] and those used in START
for parsing and generation [15], and
? linguistic complexity of sentences, measured both in terms of depths of
phrases and in terms of depths of clauses, examples of which are shown
in Table 1.

level subject (the number on the left) and predicate (the number on the right)

We extracted all of these features from part-of-speech tagged text [5] and
studied their distributions in different works. We also studied their correlations
with each other, e.g., semantic verb classes and the syntactic structure of the
alternation [21] in which they occur. The details of the relevant computations
are discussed by Uzuner [34].
3.1 Validation
We validated the syntactic elements of expression using the chi-square (and/or
likelihood ratio) test of independence. More specifically, for each of sentence-
initial and -final phrase structures, and semantic and syntactic verb classes, we
tested the null hypothesis that these features are used similarly by all authors
and that the differences observed in different books are due to chance. We per-
formed chi-square tests in three different settings: on different translations of
the same title (similar content but different expression), on different books by
different authors (different content and different expression), and on disjoint sets
of chapters from the same book (similar content and similar expression).
For almost all of the identified features, we were able to reject the null hy-
pothesis when comparing books that contain different expression, indicating that
regardless of content, these features can capture expression. For all of the fea-
tures, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis when we compared chapters
from the same book, indicating a certain consistency in the distributions of these
features throughout a work.
4 Evaluation
We used the syntactic elements of expression, i.e., sentence-initial and sentence-
final phrase structures, semantic and syntactic classes of verbs, and measures of
linguistic complexity [34,35,36], for book recognition and for authorship attribu-
tion.
4.1 Baseline Features
To evaluate the syntactic elements of expression, we compared the performance
of these features to baseline features that capture content and baseline features
that capture the way works are written. Our baseline features that capture con-
tent included tfidf-weighted keywords [27,28] excluding proper nouns, because
for copyright infringement purposes, proper nouns can easily be changed without
changing the content or expression of the documents and a classifier based on
proper nouns would fail to recognize otherwise identical works. Baseline features
that focus on the way people write included function words [25,26], distributions
of word lengths [22,40], distributions of sentence lengths [14], and a basic set
of linguistic features, extracted from tokenized, part-of-speech tagged, and/or
syntactically parsed text. This basic set of linguistic features included the num-
ber of words and the number of sentences in the document; type?token ratio;
A Comparative Study of Language Models for Book and Author Recognition 973
average and standard deviation of the lengths of words (in characters) and of
the lengths of sentences (in words) in the document; frequencies of declarative
sentences, interrogatives, imperatives, and fragmental sentences; frequencies of
active voice sentences, be-passives, and get-passives; frequencies of ?s-genitives,
of-genitives, and of phrases that lack genitives; frequency of overt negations; and
frequency of uncertainty markers [9,34].
4.2 Classification Experiments
We compared the syntactic elements of expression with the baseline features
in two separate experiments: recognizing books even when some of them are
derived from the same title (different translations) and recognizing authors. For
these experiments, we split books into chapters, created balanced sets of relevant
classes, and used boosted [29] decision trees [41] to classify chapters into books
and authors. We tuned parameters on the training set: we determined that the
performance of classifiers stabilized at around 200 rounds of boosting and we
eliminated from each feature set the features with zero information gain [8,37].
Recognizing Books: Copyrights protect original expression of content for a
limited time period. After the copyright period of a work, its derivatives by
different people are eligible for their own copyright and need to be recognized
from their unique expression of content. Our experiment on book recognition
focused on and addressed this scenario.
Data: For this experiment, we used a corpus that included 49 books derived from
45 titles ; for 3 of the titles, the corpus included multiple books (3 books for the
title Madame Bovary, 2 books for 20000 Leagues, and 2 books for The Kreutzer
Sonata). The remaining titles included works from J. Austen, F. Dostoyevski,
C. Dickens, A. Doyle, G. Eliot, G. Flaubert, T. Hardy, I. Turgenev, V. Hugo,
W. Irving, J. London, W. M. Thackeray, L. Tolstoy, M. Twain, and J. Verne.
We obtained 40?50 chapters from each book (including each of the books that
are derived from the same title), and used 60% of the chapters from each book
for training and the remaining 40% for testing.
Results: The results of this evaluation showed that the syntactic elements of
expression accurately recognized books 76% of the time; they recognized each
of the paraphrased books 89% of the time (see right column in Table 2). In
either case, the syntactic elements of expression significantly outperformed all
individual baseline features (see Table 2).
The syntactic elements of expression contain no semantic information; they
recognize books from the way they are written. The fact that these features
can differentiate between translations of the same title implies that translators
add their own expression to works, even when their books are derived from
the same title, and that the expressive elements chosen by each translator help
differentiate between books derived from the same title.
Despite recognizing books more accurately than each of the individual base-
line features, syntactic elements of expression on their own are less effective

than the combined baseline features in recognizing books; the combined baseline
features give an accuracy of 88% on recognizing books (compare this to 76%
accuracy by the syntactic elements of expression alone). But the performance of
the combined baseline features is further improved by the addition of syntactic
elements of expression (see Table 3). This improvement is statistically significant
at ? = 0.05.

Ranking the combined features based on information gain for recognizingbooks
shows that the syntactic elements of expression indeed play a significant role in rec-
ognizing books accurately; of the top tenmost useful features identifiedby informa-
tion gain, seven are syntactic elements of expression (see rows in italics in Table 4).
In the absence of syntactic elements of expression, the top ten most useful
features identified by information gain from the complete set of baseline features
reveal that the keywords ?captain? and ?sister? are identified as highly discrim-
inative features. Similarly, the function words ?she?, ?her?, and ??ll? are highly
discriminative (see Table 5). Part of the predictive power of these features is due
to the distinct contents of most of the books in this corpus; we expect that as
the corpus grows, these words will lose predictive power.
Recognizing Authors: In Section 2, we described the difference between style
and expression. These concepts, though different, both relate to the way people
write. Then, an interesting question to answer is: Can the same set of features
help recognize both books (from their unique expression) and authors (from their
unique style)?

Data: In order to answer this question, we experimented with a corpus of books
that were written by native speakers of English. This corpus included works from
eight authors: three titles by W. Irving, four titles by G. Eliot, five titles by J.
Austen, six titles by each of C. Dickens and T. Hardy, eight titles by M. Twain,
and nine titles by each of J. London and W. M. Thackeray.
Results: To evaluate the different sets of features on recognizing authors from
their style, we trained models on a subset of the titles by each of these authors
and tested on a different subset of titles by the same authors. We repeated this
experiment five times so that several different sets of titles were trained and tested
on. At each iteration, we used 150 chapters from each of the authors for training
and 40 chapters from each of the authors for testing.

The results in Table 7 show that function words capture the style of authors
better than any of the other features; syntactic elements of expression are not as
effective as function words in capturing the style of authors. This finding is consis-
tent with our intuition: we selected the syntactic elements of expression for their
ability to differentiate between individual works, even when some titles are written
by the same author and even when some books were derived from the same title.
Recognizing the style of an author requires focus on the elements that are similar in
the works written by the same author, instead of focus on elements that differenti-
ate these works. However, the syntactic elements of expression are not completely
devoid of any style information: they recognize authors accurately 62%of the time.
In comparison, the function words recognize authors accurately 87% of the time.
Top ten most predictive function words identified by information gain for author-
ship attribution are: the, not, of, she, very, be, her, ?s, and, and it.
Combining the baseline features together does not improve the performance of
function words on authorship attribution: function words give an accuracy of 87%
by themselves whereas the combined baseline features give an accuracy of 86%.1
Adding the syntactic elements of expression to the combination of baseline features
hurts performance (see Table 8).
We believe that the size of the corpus is an important factor in this conclu-
sion. More specifically, we expect that as more authors are added to the corpus,
the contribution of syntactic elements of expression to authorship attribution will
increase. To test this hypothesis, we repeated our experiments with up to thir-
teen authors. We observed that the syntactic elements of expression improved the

performance of function words degraded, the performance of syntactic elements of
expression improved, and the performance of the combined feature set remained
fairly consistent at around 88% (see Table 9).
4.3 Conclusion
In this paper, we compared several different language models on two classifica-
tion tasks: book recognition and authorship attribution. In particular, we evalu-
ated syntactic elements of expression consisting of sentence-initial and -final phrase
structures, semantic and syntactic categories of verbs, and linguistic complexity
measures, on recognizing books (even when they are derived from the same title)
and on recognizing authors. Through experiments on a corpus of novels, we have
shown that syntactic elements of expression outperform all individual baseline fea-
tures in recognizing books and when combined with the baseline features, they im-
prove recognition of books.
In our authorship attribution experiments, we have shown that the syntactic
elements of expression are not as useful as function words in recognizing the style

of authors. This finding highlights the need for a task-dependent approach to en-
gineering feature sets for text classification. In our experiments, feature sets that
have been engineered for studying expression and the language models based on
these feature sets outperform all others in identifying expression. Similarly, feature
sets that have been engineered for studying style and the language models based
on these feature sets outperform syntactic elements of expression in authorship
attribution.
