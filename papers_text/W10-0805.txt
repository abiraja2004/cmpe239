Abstract
This paper illustrates a way of using para-
phrasal interpretation of English nominal
compound for translating them into Hindi.
Input Nominal compound is first para-
phrased automatically with the 8 preposi-
tions as proposed by Lauer (1995) for the
task. English prepositions have one-to-one
mapping to post-position in Hindi. The
English paraphrases are then translated
into Hindi using the mapping schema. We
have got an accuracy of 71% over a set of
gold data of 250 Nominal Compound. The
translation-strategy is motivated by the
following observation: It is only 50% of
the cases that English nominal compound
is translated into nominal compound in
Hindi. In other cases, they are translated
into varied syntactic constructs. Among
them the most frequent construction type
is ?Modifier + Postposition + Head?. The
translation module also attempts to deter-
mine when a compound is translated using
paraphrase and when it is translated into a
Nominal compound.
1 Introduction
Nominal Compounds are syntactically condensed
constructs which have extensively been attempted
to expand in order to unfold the meaning of the
constructions. Currently there exist two different
approaches in Computational Linguistics: (a) La-
beling the semantics of compound with a set of
abstract relations (Moldovan and Girju, 2003) (b)
Paraphrasing the compound in terms of syntac-
tic constructs. Paraphrasing, again, is done in
three ways: (1) with prepositions (?war story?
? ?story about war?) (Lauer 1995) (2) with
verb+preposition nexus (?war story? ? ?story
pertaining to war?, ?noise pollution? ? ?pol-
lution caused by noise?) (Finin 1980) (3) with
Copula (?tuna fish? ? ?fish that is tuna?) (Van-
derwende,1995). Nominal compound (henceforth
NC) is a frequently occurring construct in En-
glish1. A bigram or two word nominal compound,
is a construct of two nouns, the rightmost noun
being the head (H) and the preceding noun the
modifier (M) as found in ?cow milk?, ?road condi-
tion?, ?machine translation? and so on. Rackow et
al. (1992) has rightly observed that the two main
issues in translating the source language NC cor-
rectly into the target language involves (a) correct-
ness in the choice of the appropriate target lex-
eme during lexical substitution and (b) correctness
in the selection of the right target construct type.
The issue stated in (a) involves correct selection of
sense of the component words of NCs followed by
substitution of source language word with that of
target language that best fits for the selected sense
(see Mathur and Paul 2009).
From the perspective of machine translation, the
issue of selecting the right construct of target lan-
guage becomes very significant because English
NCs are translated into varied construct types in
Hindi. This paper motivates the advantage of ex-
panding English nominal compounds into ?para-
phrases with prepositions? for translating them
into Hindi. The English NCs are paraphrased us-
ing Lauer?s (1995) 8 prepositions. In many cases
prepositions are semantically overloaded. For ex-
ample, the NC ?Hindu law? can be paraphrased
as ?law of Hindu?. This paraphrase can mean
?Law made by Hindu? (not for Hindu people alone
though) or ?Law meant for Hindu? (law can be
made by anyone, not by the Hindus necessarily).
Such resolution of meaning is not possible from
?preposition paraphrase?. The paper argues that
this is not an issue from the point of view of trans-
1Kim and Baldwin (2005) reports that the BNC corpus (84
million words: Burnard (2000)) has 2.6% and the Reuters has
(108M words: Rose et al (2002)) 3.9% of bigram nominal
compound.

lation at least. It is because the Hindi correspon-
dent of ?of?, which is ?kA?, is equally ambiguous.
The translation of ?Hindu law? is ?hinduoM kA
kAnUn? and the construction can have both afore-
mentioned interpretations. Human users can se-
lect the right interpretation in the given context.
On the other hand, ?paraphrase with preposition?
approach has the following advantages: (a) An-
notation is simpler; (b) Learning is easier and (c)
Data sparseness is less; (d) Most importantly, En-
glish prepositions have one to one Hindi postpo-
sition correspondents most of the times. There-
fore we have chosen the strategy of ?paraphrasing
with prepositions? over other kind of paraphrasal
approach for the task of translation. The pa-
per explores the possibility of maintaining one to
one correspondence of English-Hindi preposition-
postpositions and examines the accuracy of trans-
lation. At this point it is worth mentioning that
translation of English NC as NC as well as differ-
ent syntactic constructs in Hindi is almost equal.
Therefore the task of translating English NCs into
Hindi is divided into two levels: (1) Paraphrases
for an NC are searched in the web corpus, (2) An
algorithm is devised to determine when the para-
phrase is to be ignored and the source language
NC to be translated as NC or transliterated in NC,
and (3) English preposition is replaced by Hindi
corresponding postposition. We have compared
our result with that of google translation system
on 250 that has been manually created.
The next section describes the data in some de-
tail. In section 3, we review earlier works that have
followed similar approaches as the present work.
Our approach is described in section 4. Finally the
result and analysis is discussed in section 5.
2 Data
We made a preliminary study of NCs in English-
Hindi parallel corpora in order to identify the dis-
tribution of various construct types in Hindi which
English NCs are aligned to. We took a paral-
lel corpora of around 50,000 sentences in which
we got 9246 sentences (i.e. 21% cases of the
whole corpus) that have nominal compounds. We
have found that English nominal compound can be
translated into Hindi in the following varied ways:
1. As Nominal Compound
?Hindu texts? ? hindU shAstroM
?milk production? ? dugdha utpAdana
2. M + Postposition + H Construction
?rice husk?? cAvala kI bhUsI,
?room temperature?? kamare ke tApa-
mAna
?wax work?? mom par citroM
?work on wax?
?body pain?? sharIra meM darda
?pain in body?
English NCs are frequently translated into
genitive2 construct in Hindi. In English ?of?
is heavily overloaded(very ambiguous), so
the genitives are in Hindi. The two other
postpositions that we see in the above data
are par ?on? and meM ?in/at? and they refer
to location.
3. As Adjective Noun Construction
?nature cure? ? prAkritika cikitsA
?hill camel? ? pahARI UMta
The words prAkrtik and pahARI being ad-
jectives derived from prakriti and pAhAR re-
spectively.
4. Single Word
?cow dung? ? gobara
The distribution of various translations is given
below:
Construction Type No. of Occurrence
Nominal Compound 3959
Genitive(of-kA/ke/kI) 1976
Purpose (for-ke liye) 22
Location (at/on-par) 34
Location (in-meM) 93
Adjective Noun Phrase 557
Single Word 766
Transliterated NC 1208
Table 1: Distribution of translations of English NC
from English Hindi parallel corpora.
There are 8% cases (see table 1) when an En-
glish NC becomes a single word form in Hindi.
For rest of the cases, they either remain as NC
(translated 43% or transliterated 13%) or corre-
spond to syntactic construct. When NC is trans-
lated as NC, they are mostly technical terms
2?of? corresponds to ?kA/ke/kI?, which are genitive
markers in Hindi.

or proper names. Our data shows that there are
around 40% cases when English NC is translated
as various kinds of syntactic constructs such M
+ Postposition + H, Adj + H or longer para-
phrases (?Hand luggage? ? hAth meM le jAne
vAle sAmAn ?luggage to be carried by hand?). Out
of these data, 70% cases are when English NC is
translated into M3 + postposition + H. Thus the
translation of NC into postpositional construction
is very common in Hindi.
For preparation of test data, we extracted nomi-
nal compound from BNC corpus (Burnard et al,
1995). BNC has varied amount of text ranging
from newspaper article to letters, books etc. We
extracted a sample of noun-noun bigrams from the
corpus and manually translated them into Hindi.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that de-
termines when the syntactic paraphrase of English
NC is to be considered for translation and when it
is left for direct lexical substitution in Hindi.
3 Related Works
There exists no work which has attempted the
approach that we will be discussing here for
translating English NC into Hindi. From that per-
spective, the proposed approach is first of its kind
to be attempted. However, paraphrasing English
NCs is a widely studied issue. Scholars (Levi
1978; Finin 1980) agree there is a limited number
of relations that occur with high frequency in
noun compounds. However, the number and
the level of abstraction of these frequently used
semantic categories are not agreed upon. They
can vary from a few prepositional paraphrases
(Lauer, 1995) to hundreds and even thousands
more specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).
Lauer (1995), for example, considers eight prepo-
sitional paraphrases as semantic classification
categories: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and
from. According to this classification, the noun
compound ?bird sanctuary?, for instance, can
be classified both as ?sanctuary of bird? and
?sanctuary for bird?.
The automatic interpretation of noun compounds
is a difficult task for both unsupervised and super-
vised approaches. Currently, the best-performing
NC interpretation methods in computational lin-
guistics focus only on two-word noun compounds
and rely either on rather ad-hoc, domain-specific,
hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or on statistical
3M: Modifier, H: Head
models on large collections of unlabeled data.
The majority of corpus based statistical ap-
proaches to noun compound interpretation
collects statistics on the occurrence frequency
of the noun constituents and uses them in a
probabilistic model (Resnik, 1993; Lauer, 1995;
Lapata and Keller, 2004). Lauer (1995) was the
first to devise and test an unsupervised probabilis-
tic model for noun compound interpretation on
Grolier encyclopedia, an 8 million word corpus,
based on a set of 8 prepositional paraphrases. His
probabilistic model computes the probability of a
preposition p given a noun-noun pair n1-n2 and
finds the most likely prepositional paraphrase
p? = argmaxP (p|n1, n2) (1)
However, as Lauer noticed, this model requires
a very large training corpus to estimate these
probabilities. Lapata and Keller (2004) showed
that simple unsupervised models applied to the
noun compound interpretation task perform sig-
nificantly better when the n-gram frequencies are
obtained from the web (accuracy of 55.71% on Al-
tavista), rather than from a large standard corpus.
Our approach also uses web as a corpus and exam-
ines frequency of various preposition paraphrases
of a given NC. The next section describes our ap-
proach.
4 Approach
This section describes our procedure in details.
The system is comprised of the following stages:
(a) Web search of prepositional paraphrase for En-
glish NC; (b) mapping the English preposition to
corresponding Hindi postposition; (c) Evaluation
of correct paraphrasing on English side as well as
evaluation of translation.
4.1 Paraphrase Selection for Translation
Based on the observation from English-Hindi par-
allel corpus data that we examined as part of this
project, we have designed an algorithm to deter-
mine whether an English NC is to be translated
as an analytic construct or retained as an NC in
Hindi. We used Yahoo search engine to perform
a simple frequency search for ?M Preposition H?
in web corpus for a given input NC. For example,
the paraphrases obtained for the NC ?finance min-
ister? is given in table 2 and frequency of various
paraphrases is shown in the second column:
34
Paraphrase Web Frequency
minister about finance 2
minister from finance 16
minister on finance 34300
minister for finance 1370000
minister with finance 43
minister by finance 20
minister to finance 508
minister in finance 335
minister at finance 64
minister of finance 5420000
Table 2: Frequency of Paraphrases for ?finance
minister? after Web search.
In the table we notice that the distribution is
widely varied. For some paraphrase the count is
very low (minister about finance) while the high-
est count is 5420000 for ?minister of finance?. The
wide distribution is apparent even when the range
is not that high as shown in following table:
Paraphrase Web Frequency
agencies about welfare 1
agencies from welfare 16
agencies on welfare 64
agencies for welfare 707
agencies with welfare 34
agencies in welfare 299
agencies at welfare 0
agencies of welfare 92
Table 3: Frequency of Paraphrases for ?welfare
agencies? after Web search.
During our experiment we have come across
three typical cases: (a) No paraphrase is avail-
able when searched; (b) Frequency counts of some
paraphrases for a given NC is very low and (c) Fre-
quency of a number of paraphrases cross a thresh-
old limit. The threshold is set to be mean of all
the frequencies of paraphrases. Each of such cases
signifies something about the data and we build
our translation heuristics based on these observa-
tions. When no paraphrase is found in web corpus
for a given NC, we consider such NCs very close-
knit constructions and translate them as nominal
compound in Hindi. This generally happens when
the NC is a proper noun or a technical term. Sim-
ilarly when there exists a number of paraphrases
each of those crossing the threshold limit, it indi-
cates that the noun components of such NCs can
occur in various contexts and we select the first
3 paraphrase as probable paraphrase of NCs. For
example, the threshold value for the NC finance
minister is: Threshold = 6825288/8 = 853161.
The two paraphrases considered as probable para-
phrase of this NC is are therefore ?minister of fi-
nance? and ?minister for finance?. The remain-
ing are ignored. When count of a paraphrase is
less than the threshold, they are removed from the
data. We presume that such low frequency does
not convey any significance of paraphrase. On the
contrary, they add to the noise for probability dis-
tribution. For example, all paraphrases of ?ante-
lope species? except ?species of antelope? is very
low as shown in Table 4. They are not therefore
considered as probable paraphrases.
Paraphrase Web Frequency
species about antelope 0
species from antelope 44
species on antelope 98
species for antelope 8
species with antelope 10
species in antelope 9
species at antelope 8
species of antelope 60600
Table 4: Frequency of Paraphrases for antelope
species after Web search.
4.2 Mapping English Preposition to Hindi
Post-position
The strategy of mapping English preposition to
one Hindi post-position is a crucial one for the
present task of translation. The decision is mainly
motivated by a preliminary study of aligned paral-
lel corpora of English and Hindi in which we have
come across the distribution of Lauer?s 8 preposi-
tions as shown in table 5.
The table (Table 5) shows that English preposi-
tions are mostly translated into one Hindi postpo-
sition except for a few cases such as ?at?, ?with?
and ?for?. The probability of ?on? getting trans-
lating into ?ko? and ?of? into ?se? is very less
and therefore we are ignoring them in our map-
ping schema. The preposition ?at? can be trans-
lated into ?meM? and ?para? and both postposi-
tions in Hindi can refer to ?location?. However,
the two prepositions ?with? and ?for? can be trans-
lated into two distinct relations as shown in Ta-
ble 5. From our parallel corpus data, we therefore

find that these prepositions are semantically over-
loaded from Hindi language perspective. The right
sense and thereafter the right Hindi correspondent
can be selected in the context. In the present task,
we are selecting the mapping with higher prob-
ability. English Prepositions are mapped to one
Hindi Post-position for all cases except for ?at?
and ?about?.

Table 6: Preposition-Postposition Mapping
Post-positions in Hindi can be multi-word as in
?ke bAre meM?, ?ke liye? and so on. In the present
paper we are translating the English preposition to
the mostly probable postposition of Hindi. That
does not mean that the preposition cannot be trans-
lated into any other postposition. However, we are
taking the aforementioned stand as an preliminary
experiment and further refinement in terms of se-
lection of postposition will be done as future work.
For the present study, lexical substitution of head
noun and modifier noun are presumed to be cor-
rect.
5 Result and Analysis
In this section we will describe results of two
steps that are involved in our work: (a) Selection
of English preposition paraphrase for a given En-
glish NC; (b) Translation of English Preposition to
Hindi Post-position.
For a given NC we used a brute force method
to find the paraphrase structure. We used Lauer?s
prepositions (of, in, about, for, with, at, on, from,
to, by) for prepositional paraphrasing. Web search
is done on all paraphrases and frequency counts
are retrieved. Mean frequency (F) is calculated us-
ing all frequencies retrieved. All those paraphrases
that give frequency more than F are selected. We
first tested the algorithm on 250 test data of our
selection. The result of the top three paraphrases
are given below :
Selection Technique Precision
Top 1 61.6%
Top 2 67.20%
Top 3 71.6%
Table 7: Paraphrasing Accuracy
We have also tested the algorithm on Lauer?s
test data (first 218 compounds out 400 of NCs)
and got the following results (Table 8). Each of
the test data was marked with a preposition which
best explained the relationship between two noun
components. Lauer gives X for compounds which
cannot be paraphrased by using prepositions For
eg. tuna fish.

Lauer?s on his data. We gave the results with cri-

Prepositions (X) are also considered.

Table 9: Comparison of our approach with Lauer?s
Approach
Now that we have paraphrased NCs, we attempt
to translate the output into Hindi. We assume that
we have the right lexical substitution. In this pa-
per we have checked for the accuracy of the right
Hindi construction selection.
For a given NC we got the paraphrase as ?H
prep M? or ?MH?. We use English preposition
mapping as described in section 4.2 for translat-
ing NC in Hindi. For MH type compounds di-
rect lexical substitution is tried out. We tested our
approach on the gold data of 250 Nominal Com-
pounds. We translate the same 250 NCs using
google translation system in order to set up a base-
line. Google Translator could translate the data
with 68.8% accuracy.
Google returns only one translation which we
evaluated against our test data. In our case, we
have taken 3 top paraphrases as described in sec-
tion 4.1 and translated them into Hindi by using
the English preposition to Hindi postposition map-
ping schema. The following table presents the
accuracy of the translation of the top three para-
phrases

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper describes a preliminary approach for
translating English nominal compound into Hindi
using paraphrasing as a method of analysis of
source data. The result of translation is encourag-
ing as a first step towards this kind of work. This
work finds out a useful application for the task
of paraphrasing nominal compound using prepo-
sition. The next step of experiment includes the
following tasks: (a) Designing the test data in such
a way that all correspondents get equal represen-
tation in the data. (b) To examine if there are any
other prepositions (besides Lauer?s 8 preposition)
which can be used for paraphrasing (c) To use con-
text for translation.
