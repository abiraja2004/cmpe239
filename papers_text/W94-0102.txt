Abst ract  
Several Corpus Linguistics research groups have gone 
beyond collation of 'raw' text, to syntactic annotation 
of the text. However, linguists developing these lin- 
guistic resources have used quite different wordtagging 
and parse-tree labelling schemes in each of these anno- 
tated corpora. This restricts the accessibility of each 
corpus, making it impossible for speech and handwrit- 
ing researchers to collate them into a single very large 
training set. This is particularly problematic as there 
is evidence that one of these parsed corpora on its own 
is too small for a general statistical model of grammat- 
ical structure, but the combined size of all the above 
annotated corpora should deliver a much more reliable 
model. 
We are developing a set of mapping algorithms to 
map between the main tagsets and phrase structure 
grammar schemes used in the above corpora. We plan 
to develop a Multi-tagged Corpus and a MultiTreebank, 
a single text-set annotated with all the above tagging 
and parsing schemes. The text-set is the Spoken En- 
glish Corpus: this is a half-way house between formal 
written text and colloquial conversational speech. How- 
ever, the main deliverable to the computational linguis- 
tics research community is not the SEC-based Multi- 
Treebank, but the mapping suite used to produce it 
- this can be used to combine currently-incompatible 
syntactic training sets into a large unified multicorpus. 
Our architecture combines standard statistical language 
modelling and a rule-base derived from linguists' anal- 
yses of tagset-mappings, in a novel yet intuitive way. 
Our development of the mapping algorithms aims to 
distinguish notational from substantive differences in 
the annotation schemes, and we will be able to evalu- 
ate tagging schemes in terms of how well they fit stan- 
dard statistical language models uch as n-pos (Markov) 
models. 1

In t roduct ion  
Several research projects around the world are buihli.g 
grammatically analysed corpora; that is, collections o1" 
text annotated with part-of-speech wordtags and sy.- 
tax trees. Tagged and parsed English corpora (Ba.k of 
English \[54\]; BNC \[441, \[22\]; Brown \[24\]; ICE \[12\], \[28\], 
\[64\]; Lancaster-IBM \[26\], \[22\]; LOB \[1\], \[3\], \[38\], \[.12\]; 
London-Lund \[62\]; Nijmegen \[12\]; PoW \[23\], \[55\], \[57\]; 
SEC \[631; TOSCA \[46\], \[311, \[12\]; UPenn \[53\], \[45\]; etc) 
are used, among other things, as atithoritative exal n pies 
by researchers in English Language Teaching and Lexi- 
cography (e.g. \[44\]), and as training data for statistical 
syntactic onstraint models to improve recognition ac- 
curacy in speech and handwriting recognisers (e.g. \[37\], 
\[I01). 
However, projects have used quite different wordtag- 
ging and parsing schemes. In contrast o the Speech 
research community, which has reached broad agree- 
ment on an uncontentious set of labelling conventions 
for phonetic/phonemic analysis, there is no general con- 
sensus in the international Natural Language research 
community on analogous conventions for grammatical 
analysis, Developers of corpora adhere to a variety o\[' 
competing models or theories of grammar and parsing, 
with the effect of restricting the accessibility of their 
respective corpora, and the potential for collation into 
a single fully parsed corpus. 
In view of this heterogeneity, we have begun to in- 
vestigate and develop methods of automatically map- 
ping between the annotation schemes of the most widely 
known corpora, thus assessing their differences and im- 
proving the reusability of the corpora. Annotating a 
single corpus with the different schemes allows for com- 
parisons, and will provide a rich test-bed for automatic 
parsers. 
The most widely known tagged colrpora for English 
are: the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus; the 
Brown Corpus; and the London-Lund Corpus. In addi- 
the Higher Education Funding Councils' New Technologies 
Initiative (HEFCs' NTI); we gratefully acknowledge their 
financial support. We are also grateful to the Corpus \[,in- 
guistics research teams who have generously provided back- 
ground information on their tagging and parsing schcnlt:s. 
11 
lion, the International Corpus of English (ICE) should 
b,, included as its tagset has now been published \[28\]. 
Parsed corpora for English include: the Lancaster-IBM 
l'rcebank; the Lancaster-IBM Spoken English Corpus 
(SEC) 'rreebank; the Lancaster-Leeds Treebank; the 
Polytechnic of Wales (PEW) Corpus; the Nijmegen 
('orpus; the TOSCA Corpus;; and the University of 
P,,nnsylvania (UPenn) Treebank. We plan to include 
the parsed ICE-GB (Great Britain component of ICE) 
and the BNC (British National Corpus) in the project 
when they become available. 
As a development and testing resource, we are us- 
ing the text of the Lancaster-IBM Spoken English Cor- 
pus (SEC). The SEC is a collection of recordings of ra- 
dio broadcasts with accompanying annotated transcrip- 
tie,s, collected by Lancaster University and IBM UK 
as a general research resource. The SEC is available 
from the International Computer Archive of Modern 
English (ICAME) based at the Norwegian Computing 
(',entre for the Humanities (in Bergen, Norway). The 
corpus exists in several forms and annotations: the digi- 
tiscd acoustic waveform; the graphemic transcription 
a.m~otated with prosodic markings; and a part-of-speech 
analysis (using the LOB Corpus tagset). Skeletal pars- 
ing has been added to create the SEC Treebank, and 
this forms a subset of the Lancaster-IBM Treebank. 
(;crry Knowles (Lancaster) and Peter Roach (Leeds) 
are collaborating in an ESRC-funded project to set up 
a time-aligned atabase of recorded speech, accompa- 
nied by phonetic and graphemic transcriptions. Our 
proposal will produce, as a side-effect, several alterna- 
tive tagged and parsed versions of the SEC which will 
b,, made available to the SEC database project collab- 
orators. It will also be able to act as a test-bed for the 
('ompa.rison and evaluation of parsing schemes. 
Objectives of the project 
The main objectives are as follows : 
To design and implement algorithms for mapping be- 
ween corpus annotation schemes; for both wordtag sets 
a ml phrase structure grammar schemes. 
To empirically evaluate the accuracy and shortcom- 
ings of the developed mapping algorithms, by applying 
them to the tagged SEC and the SEC Treebank. The 
~,ulcome of this evaluation will be to highlight the no- 
la~h)nal and substantive differences between the alter- 
Ilative tagging and parsing schemes. 
To build a Multi-Tagged Corpus, by enhancing the 
Spok~,n English Corpus with different wordtagging 
~chCIItes. 
To build a Multi-Treebank, by enhancing the Spoken 
English Corpus with grammatical nalyses according to 
s,,v,,ral alternative grammatical theories. 
To investigate tim use of tile Multi-Treebank as a 
h,.~chmark for grammars and parsers. 
Itfil.ially, we considered adopting the 'lnterlingua p- 
I,r,,ach' to mapping, as used in Machine Translation 
l,r,~j,','ts such as EUR.OTRA. This would require us 
to develop tagset mappings between the LOB Corpus 
(our primary tagset Interlingua) and each of the 'ma- 
jor' tagged corpora: BROWN, ICE, Lancaster-IBM, 
and UPenn. Next full grammar mappings would be 
developed between the Lancaster-IBM Treebank (our 
primary parsing scheme Interlingua) and each of: the 
UPenn Treebank and the Lancaster-Leeds Treehank. 
The ICE and BNC tagsets and parsing schemes could 
be included when they become available. Mapping be- 
tween tagsets will involve relabelling of words, whereas 
mapping between grammar schemes also involves truc- 
tural manipulation. These treebanks have been chosen 
for their skeletal parsing schemes, which are of rela- 
tively similar structure apart from a small number of 
systematic differences. 
We have chosen the SEC as a 'core' text for this 
project, because 
1. the tagged SEC uses the same tagset as the LOB 
Corpus (widely considered to be the UK standard 
and our proposed primary tagset); 
2. the parsed SEC uses the same grammatical scheme as 
the Lancaster-IBM Treebank (our proposed primary 
parsing scheme); 
3. these are the annotation schemes which we have most 
prior experience of; 
4. the text material, BBC radio broadcasts, are a neu- 
tral compromise between written and conversational 
spoken English genres. 
Our aim is to develop bidirectional mappings for 
the above tagsets and grammar schemes, although we 
appreciate that for mapping from simple to delicate 
schemes this will not be possible, and that mappings 
will be imperfect. As mapping algorithms are devel- 
oped and tested, and whilst building the Multi-Tagged 
Corpus and Multi-Treebank, we will compile "hand- 
books" of common errors (i.e. mismatches) and their 
corrections. These will help future users of the devel- 
oped mapping algorithms to straightforwardly post-edit 
their mapped corpora and treebanks, thus maximising 
resource reusability. To map between two tagsets other 
than LOB, two mappings will be necessary (via the 
primary tagset, our "interlingua" representation); simi- 
laxly for non-terminal grammar schemes. We appreciate 
the danger of propogating incorrect mappings. 
If there is sufficient ime, we hope to go on to in- 
vestigate mapping algorithms for other (more detailed) 
grammar schemes; for example the parsed Pew Cor- 
pus (Systemic Functional Grammar), and the parsed 
Nijmegen Corpus (Extended Affix Grammar). The 
non-corpus-based Generalised Phrase Structure Gram- 
mar (GPSG) (as used in the Alvey Natural Language 
Toolkit ANLT) should also be included. Mapping from 
these to the Lancaster-IBM Treebank grammar scheme 
would only be uni-directional i.e. from a d,:tail,~d to a 
skeletal analysis. 
The Multi-Treebank will be produced by applying 
the final version of each grammar scheme mapping al- 
12 
gorithm to the SEC Treebank. Similarly, for the Multi- 
Tagged Corpus, the final version of each tagset mapping 
algorithm will be applied to the tagged SEC. The re- 
suiting annotations will then be intensively proofread 
and post-edited. This will require consultations with 
authorities in each of the tagsets and grammar schemes 
involved. 
Progress to date 
We envisage three main stages to the project: imple- 
mentation of algorithms for mapping between tagsets; 
implementation of algorithms for mapping between 
phrase structure grammatical analysis schemes; and 
investigating applications of the mapping programs, 
multi-tagged corpus, and multi-treebank. 
We are currently in the first of these. Mapping algo- 
rithms are being designed and implemented between the 
LOB Corpus tagset and each of: the tagged BROWN 
Corpus, the tagged ICE, the Lancaster-IBM Treebank, 
the UPenn Tagset (and the BNC tagset will be added 
when published). Each tagset is being considered in 
turn: 
1. Analysis of the notational and substantive differences 
between the LOB tagset and the 'current' tagset. 
2. Design and implementation of a mapping algorithm 
(two-way, where possible). 
3. Evaluate success of algorithm by applying it to the 
tagged SEC; incrementally improve in light of com- 
mon errors and linguistic intuition. 
A side-effect of this phase is the production of a 
Multi-Tagged Corpus: the SEC text annotated with 
each tagset. 
A s tandard  fo rmat  for  tagged and  parsed  
corpora  
As well as using different agsets and parsing schemes, 
different annotated corpora come in a range of different 
formats - see \[57\], \[59\], \[60\]. A non-trivial first step in 
merging tagged and parsed corpora is to decide on a 
unitary standardised format. Although the Text En- 
coding Initiaitive (TEI) \[61\], \[18\] offers general guide- 
lines for text formatting standards, and some corpora 
(including BNC, ICE) aim to be "rEI-conformant", in
practice it seems almost as hard for Corpus linguists 
to agree to accept a single annotation format as it is 
to agree on a single annotation scheme. Our mapping 
software will use a standardised internal format for tag- 
gings and parse-trees, but will have to be able to accept 
input and produce output in a range of existing formats. 
Hand-c ra f t ing  a deta i led  mapp ing  
One approach to obtaining a mapping between two 
tagsets is to use expert linguistic knowledge in iden- 
tifying the relationship between particular tags, and is 
exemplified in, for example, \[58\]. In this work, Souter 
drew up a mapping between the parts of speech used in 
the CELEX database \[17\], (which were thet,,sclw,s <t,,- 
rived largely from those in LDOCE \[51\]), and th,, sys- 
temic functional grammar (SFG) used to hand pars," 
the Polytechnic of Wales corpus \[23\], \[551 . 
The aim was to provide a large lexicon to supporL 
SFG-based parsing programs. The original CELEX h.x- 
icon, which contained some 80,000 English wordforms. 
was transformed into a lexicon with SFG tags, usi,g a 
semi-automatic mapping program, written in the AWK 
programming language. The resulting lexicon was tl,,. 
compatible with a large corpus-based systemic gram- 
mar consisting of over 4,000 phrase-structure rules \[56\]. 
Together they can then support relatively robust prob- 
abilistic parsing programs. 
The problems encountered in trying to specify such 
a mapping result from disparity in the level of delicacy 
in the two tagging schemes. Mapping from a coats,,- to 
fine-grained grammar must be achieved manually, us,' 
subcategorisation information contained in the lexi~'o., 
contextual information, or exception lists. Souter's pro- 
gram contained simple one-to-one mappings, many-l.o- 
one mappings, and one-to-many mappings upported 
by exception lists and subcategorisation information. 
In his work, contextual information could not bc ,sed 
to support he mapping because the source material w~us 
a lexicon and not a tagged corpus. A small part of the 
mapping code (used to map between pronoun labels) is 
shown in Figure 1. 
else if (category ffi= "PRON") # pronouns 
( 
if (\$8 ffi "Y") printf("HWH)(") # I/H-pronouns 
else if ((\$I ~ffi "no-one")l l\ 
( \$1 == "nobody")\[ 1\ 
( \$1 . . . .  nothing") \[ l \  
(\$I == "noone") J l\ 
(\$I .... none") ) 
printf("HPN) (") # negative pronouns 
else printf("HP)(") # other pronouns 
} 
Figure 1: Fragment of an AWK mapping 
from CELEX to SFG tagsets 
Here, the coarse-grained CELEX tag PRON (pro- 
noun) is mapped to three SFG tags, HWH, HPN and 
HP. The default mapping is to HP (pronominal head of 
the nominal group), but if the CELEX lexicon contains 
subcategorisation information in the form of a Y in col- 
umn 8, then we can assign the label for wh-pronou, 
head (HWH). An exception list is used to map to the 
third SFG pronoun label (HPN), for negative pronoun 
heads. 
Inc rementa l  re f inement  th rough feedback  
Earlier work at Leeds \[32\] explored ways that a prob- 
abilistic grammar may be improved with positiw, fi~ed- 
back from a human user; this has direct implications 
13 
fi)r how to improve the mappings incrementally. As the 
mapped annotations are to be hand-corrected by ex- 
i)(,rts this provides positive feedback. Rather than tag 
the cole text completely using the best derived mapping 
a better idea would be to do it in sections and then have 
Iho ~,xpert correct he errors in each section in turn. Af- 
ter each section is complete the mapping rules will be 
ul)dated to incorporate the new information. Hopefully 
this will enable future sections to be mapped more ac- 
curately. This method is similar to that used by the 
Ni.imegen corpus parsing group, \[47\] 
P rob lems w i th  the  in ter l ingua-based  
approach  
TIw interlingua idea seems sound for several reasons. 
Amongst hese is the saving made in required map- 
pings. For instance, tire tagging schemes would require 
twenty mappings if each pair is mapped irectly in both 
(lir~,ctions. However only eight mappings axe required 
if one of the tagging schemes acts as an interlingua. 
This saving becomes greater as more tagging schemes 
arc considered. The interlingua lso helps the map- 
pings attain a level of consistency as the interlingua 
is I.ho basis of all possible mappings from one tagging 
scheme to another. However, the interlingua may cause 
prol)lenm in the instances where it is coarse-grained rel- 
ative to other tagging schemes. For instance, the LOB 
tagset has no notion of verb transitivity whereas the 
ICE tagset does. If a mapping is being made between 
two tagging schemes both of which incorporate the con- 
cept of transitivity then a tag may be wrongly allocated 
a.~ the sense of transitivity is lost via the LOB tagset 
intcrlingua. 
One problem with the work plan is the strong em- 
phasis on this problem of imperfect mappings due to 
course-grained parts of the interlingua. It may turn out 
after experimentation that the contextual information 
of the surrounding tags and words make up for this. 
'l'hc sentence, S, the interlingua tags, a, and the other 
I..Igging scheme's tags, b, can be represented as follows: 
! 
Sentence Tagging 1 Tagging 2 
$1 al bl 
82 a2 b2 
$3 as ba 
S. -  u an-2 bn- 2 
Sn-1 an-1 bn-1 
S.  a. b,~ 
Using a window of the closest four neighbours, say, 
the tag ai when presented with a difficult tag, bi, has 
I,hc additional context information of Si-2, S i - t ,  Si+l, 
N',t:,, o,-2, ai--t, ai+l and ai+a to work on. Previous 
rcs,.arch (including \[4\], \[5\], \[33\], \[34\], \[35\], \[36\]) has indi- 
,.at,.d I hat there is a high degree of useful contextual in- 
I',~rmal ion implied by the surrounding items. This con- 
textual information can be used with clustering tech- 
niques to classify words. These techniques could be 
applied to the tagging scheme with little modification. 
The classifications could then be examined to see which 
types of tag are difficult to group. Tags which are dif- 
ficult to cluster may be useful in identifying problem 
areas early. As an example, Figure 2 shows a clustering 
dendogram for the LOB Corpus tagset. 
One possible problem might be: given the set of 
Words in (SI ... Sn) and the interlingua tags (al... an) 
how are the other tagging scheme's tags (bl...bn) de- 
rived? Obviously, the tagging scheme itself can be used 
to map directly the words ($I... Sn) onto the tags 
(bl...bn) without knowledge of the interlingua tags 
(al...an). Also, mappings could be made solely be- 
tween the interlingua tags (al ... an) and the other tags 
(bl ... bn). This could be done by having an expert tag 
a section of the 'core text' with both the interlingua and 
the other tagging scheme. Probabilisitic rules could be 
derived indicating how the tags match up. These rules 
would be strengthened if the context of the surrounding 
tags was incorporated. 
When the two pieces of information axe combined it 
is hoped that a more accurate mapping can be achieved. 
This can be done by mapping directly from the word 
plus tag to the new tag. For instance; 
Si + ai ~ bi. 
However, rules could grow very large even when reg- 
ularities are used to reduce their number. 
Alternatively, a mapping could be made for Si ~-* bil 
according to the standard annotation rules for the non- 
interlingua tagging scheme; and a mapping could be 
done for ai ~ bi2 according to the procedure outlined 
above. These mappings produce two potential tags in- 
dependently. One algorithm might always accept bil 
when bil = hi2. When b~l ~ bi2 a decision needs to 
be made as to which, if any, of the tags should be cho- 
sen. Brill \[14\] developed a clever and highly accurate 
tagging scheme which could have implications for this 
problem. He tagged every occurrence of a word with its 
most probable tag if there was more than one choice. A 
second pass of the corpus would update the tags accord- 
ing to a set of automatically acquired rules. A similar 
idea could be utilised to choose between the tags. Per- 
haps the most probable tag would always be selected 
on the first pass but we would allow that decision to be 
altered on a second pass according to rules derived from 
earlier sections of the corpus that had been tagged and 
checked by the expert linguist. This, then, is another 
example of incremental learning. 
Combin ing  Symbol i c  and  Stat i s t i ca l  
Approaches  to Language 
Our research is particularly relevant to this work- 
shop, as it is clear we will have to combine rule- 
based symbol-mapping knowledge with statistical dis- 
ambiguation models. We envisage that the bulk of a

Figure 2: A Clustering of LOB Tags 
mapping can be done using simple one-to-one symbol 
replacement rules; but some rules will map one source 
symbol onto a set of more than one target symbol. A 
statistical part-of-speech tagger along the lines of th,~ 
CLAWS tagger used on LOB \[42\], [3\], \[25\] ca,, th,'.,, l., 
used to select between the reduced camlhhtt,, set ush,g ~, 
statistical context model; probably a lst-order Mark, w 
or Bi-Pos model is most appropriate as this is tt,' sim- 
plest 'standard' statistical language model and is widely 
used and understood, see for example \[2\], \[48\], \[7\], \[37\], 
\[9\], \[49\]. 
We can arrive at such a model of source-to-tart:it 
mapping by 'working backwards': first run a CLAWS- 
style Markovian target-tagset tagger over the text, ig- 
noring the source tags; proofread the output to note 
where this makes mistakes (assigns incorrect target 
tags); and then devise source-to-target tag mapping 
rules only for these cases. We are aware from our own 
initial attempts at deivising tag-mappings that this re- 
quires a high level of specialist linguistic knowledge, of 
both source and target agset; this "symbolic patching 
of the statistical model" approach minimises the 'lin- 
guistic expertise' we need to capture (and first develop!) 
to devise symbolic mapping rules. We have learnt of 
corpus-tagset mapping work by a number of other re- 
searchers (including \[13\], \[30\], \[20\] [39\] [41\], \[52\]), I ut 
generally such research in the past has been merely a 
means to an end (to create a re-tagged Corpus), so 
the full mapping algorithms have not been formalis~,d 
or published; but if all we need is a limited nub~'r of 
mapping-rules to "patch" the Markov model the,t we 
may be able to glean sufficient details from informal 
notes etc. It may appear that we are promoting bad 
Software Engineering principles in advocating symbolic 
"patches" to fix the flaws in the statistical model as and 
when we spot them - patching up a program as the bugs 
seep out, However, we prefer to view this as a princi- 
pled, well-founded approach to combining symbolic and 
statistical models, minimising the 'overlap' by ensufi,g 
that each has a separate useful contribution to mak(, I.o 
the overall mapping task. 
We envisage combining a CLAWS-style tagger mod- 
ule for each of the target tagsets into a single Multi- 
tagger program. This accepts as input a stream of 
words annotated with tag(s) from one (or more) of tlw 
source tagsets; to output is a stream of words plus t~tgs 
from ALL target tagsets. This model allows for inclu- 
sion of mapping rules both direct from source to targ,q. 
tagset, and via an interlingua (a backup default o try 
if there are no direct mapping rules). 
Future Work 
The remainder of the project will be devoted to tim 
two other phases of the plan listed earlier, mapping be- 
tween phrase-structure parsing schemes, and investigkt- 
ing applications of the multi-tagged corpus and multi- 
treebank.

Imp lementat ion  of  A lgor i thms For  
Mapp ing  Between Grammar  Schemes  
Initially mapping algorithms will be designed and im- 
plemented between the Lancaster-IBM Treebank gram- 
mar scheme, and each of the UPenn Treebank and the 
Lancaster-Leeds Treebank. Each grammar scheme will 
bc considered in turn: 
1. Analysis of the notational nd substantive differences 
b~.tween the Lancaster-IBM grammar scheme and the 
~cHrrent' grammar scheme. 
2. Mammlly parse a subset of the SEC according to the 
'current' grammar scheme. This subset should be 
sufficient to allow a prototype mapping algorithm to 
I~q~ imluced.  
:~. Apply mapping algorithm to the parsed SEC; incre- 
mentally improve in light of common errors and lin- 
guistic intuition. 
Dcpending on how much time is available, mapping 
algorithms for more detailed grammar schemes will be 
investigated: parsed POW Corpus, parsed Nijmegen 
(',orpus, GPSG, and the BNC grammar scheme (when 
published). A side-effect of this phase will be the pro- 
duction of a Multi-Treebank; the SEC automatically 
a:mml.ated with each grammar scheme. 
The all-in-one Multi-tagger architecture outlined 
~d,ove can be carried over to a Multi-parser. Instead 
of a CLAWS-style Markovian tagger, for each target 
parsing scheme agrammar and parser can be extracted 
directly from the corresponding training Treebank. A 
Context-Free Grammar can be elicited directly by ex- 
tracting each non-terminal nd its immediate-daughter- 
scqu~'nce, to become the left-hand-side and right-hand- 
side respectively ofa context-free grammar rule \[6\]; fre- 
quencies of constituents in the training treebank can be 
used to make this a Probabilistic Context Free Gram- 
mar \[49\], useable in a treebank-trained probabilistic 
parser such as those in \[2\], \[29\], \[9\], \[50\]. Rather than 
producing a single, fully correct parse-tree for each 
input sentence, these probabilistic Treebank-trained 
p~rser generally output an ordered list of possible parse- 
trees, with a probability or weight attached to each. 
As with the procedure for developing a partial tag- 
mapping, we need only devise source-to-target parse- 
tree-constituent mappings in cases where the target- 
parser's 'best' parsetree is not fully correct. 
Assessment  o f  the  Mu l t i -T reebank  as a 
Benchmark  for Grammars  
'this requires analysis of the substantive differences bee- 
tw,'en different parses of the SEC sentences; detailed 
analysis of how many and which constructs differ in 
tlw dilfcrent language umdels. It may be possible to 
divide. I,he sentences in the SEC into two subsets: a 
~'ommon core of "uncontentious" sentences which all or 
most lheories analyse in much the same way; and a 
"troublesome" subset of sentences which linguists can 
concentrate heir debate on. 
One possible criticism of a lot of work in Corpus 
Linguistics, including the AMALGAM proposed work- 
plan, is that we restrict ourselves to variants of exist- 
ing tagging and parsing schemes which are specifically 
crafted for Corpus annotation, but which are quite dif- 
ferent from grammar models being advocated and de- 
veloped by non-Corpus-based theoretical linguists, such 
as GPSG or HPSG (see e.g. \[27\]). Unfortunately, we 
know of no English corpus parsed according to such 
a feature-based unification-oriented formalism, so one 
cannot readily be included in the AMALGAM project; 
however, we would like to hear from theoretical linguists 
who we could collaborate with in extending the multi- 
parser to a unificational grammar formalism. It is not 
clear that our multi-corpus will be a 'fair' benchmark 
for testing grammars and parsers from such widely- 
differing theories; it will be interesting to see whether 
the partition between "uncontentious" and "trouble- 
some" sentences i  also applicable in assessment of uni- 
ficational grammars. 
Another constraint of the AMALGAM project is that 
we are not considering Corpus-based semantic tagging 
schemes (e.g. \[4O\], \[22\], \[21\]), only syntactic tagging 
schemes. Again, it will be interesting to see whether 
the syntactically "troublesome" sentences are also se- 
mantically complex or anomalous; but this is a question 
for another, follow-up, project. 
Compar i son  o f  the  Mu l t i -T reebank  w i th  
o ther  parsed  corpora  
We will compare the SEC data with other parsed texts 
(LOB, UPenn, POW,  Nijmegen, etc), to assess differ- 
ences in the range and frequency distributions of gram- 
matical constructs. The SEC consists of transcripts 
of scripted (and probably rehearsed) radio broadcasts. 
Some natural anguage researchers may feel that the 
Spoken English dataset is thus inappropriate for their 
work, since the grammars and parsers they are devel- 
oping are designed for a different type of language, 
for example, unrehearsed informal spoken dialogue as 
found in the London-Lund Corpus and British Na- 
tional Corpus spoken section, or more formal published 
(written) text as found in the Brown and Lancaster- 
Oslo/Bergen Corpora. It may be appropriate to aug- 
ment the SEC dataset with additional material from 
alternative sources. On the other hand, it may be that 
the main differences are in vocabulary rather than syn- 
tax, and that the coverage of the SEC, though not com- 
plete or perfect, is adequate for most applications. Wc  
will try to find empirical evidence for or against the ac- 
ceptability of 'scripted' Spoken English to the NL  com- 
mun ity.

Assessment  o f  Mu l tbTreebank  as a 
Benchmark  for Parsers  
This will involve attempting toparse the SEC text with 
other parsers, available from a variety of sources. To 
avoid the need for intensive manual proofreading or 
checking of results, a (semi-)antomatic assessment pro- 
cedure will be developed. 
Ant ic ipated  Resu l ts  
The tangible 'deliverables' of use to the Speech and 
Language research community include: 
. Final implementations of algorithms for mapping be- 
tween pairs of tagsets 
. Final implementations of algorithms for mapping be- 
tween pairs of Treebanks 
? Handbooks of common errors and corrections for 
post-editing 
? The Multi-Tagged Corpus 
. The MultiTreebank 
? Reports on the above 
The mapping software, Multi-tagged Corpus and 
MultiTreebank (along with postediting handbooks and 
documentation) will be delivered to ICAME and Ox- 
ford Text Archive for public distribution; they will 
also be available for incorporation i to the SEC Speech 
Database. Reports on the findings of the three stages 
of investigations will be made widely available to all in- 
terested parties through SALT and ELSNET (UK and 
European Networks of Excellence) and other channels 
including conference presentations and journal papers. 
Applications 
The implemented mapping algorithms will be made 
widely available to the UK and international speech 
and language research community. They will allow re- 
search groups who are using corpus-based training data 
to make use of other corpora straightforwardly, without 
substantial modifications. Any current and future users 
of corpora will have a much expanded resource. 
The Multi-Tagged Corpus and the Multi-Treebank 
will be distributed, along with the main Spoken English 
Corpus, through ICAME. They will also be available for 
incorporation i to the SEC Speech Database currently 
being created by Gerry Knowles and Peter Roach, fur- 
ther enhancing the SEC as a general research resource. 
Both the Multi-Tr'eebank and the Multi-Tagged cor- 
pus will potentially be used by speech and language 
technology groups for many research and teaching pur- 
poses, including: training data for speech-recognisers, 
optical text recognisers, word processor text-critiquing 
systems, machine translation systems, natural language 
interfaces, and NLP applications generally; and for pro- 
viding examples for English Language Teaching (ELT) 
grammar textbooks and training material. In addi- 
tion, the Multi-Treebank may be used as a testbed and 
benchmark for parsers (explored in the workpla.). It 
would also be a rich resource for grammar-learning ,,x- 
periments - a research topic of growing interest (see ,,.g. 
\[8\], \[11\], [16\], [33\]). 
We envisage supplying the computational linguistics 
research community with a valuable research rcso,,rc,', 
and the ACL Workshop will be all invaluable ol?port, 
nity for us to survey potential customer require.w.ts 
and preferences!
