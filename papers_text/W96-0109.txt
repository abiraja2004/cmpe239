Summary  
The paper demonstrates how information on text structure can be used to improve the 
performance on the identification of topical words in texts, which is based on a probabilistic 
model of text categorization. We use texts which are not explicitly structured. A text 
structure is identified by measuring the similarity between segments comprising the text and 
its title. It is shown that a text structure thus identified gives a good clue to finding out 
parts of the text most relevant o its content. The significance of exploiting information on 
the structure for topic identification is demonstrated by a set of experiments conducted on 
the 19Mb of Japanese newspaper articles. The paper also brings concepts from the rhetorical 
structure theory (RST) to the statistical analysis of a text structure. Finally, it is shown that 
information on text structure is more effective for large documents than for small documents. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Topic identification concerns a problem of predicting terms in text which indicate its subject or theme. 
In the past, the problem has been addressed mostly by computational linguists in relation to issues like 
coreference (Hobbs, 1978), anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lappin and Leass, 1994), or 
discourse center (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981; Walker et al, 1994). In information retrieval, predicting 
important erms in document is crucial for an effective retrieval of relevant documents(Salton et al, 
1993), though they do not necessarily correspond to the subject or the theme. Predicting important 
terms involves numerical weighting of terms in document. Terms with top weights are judged important 
and representative of document. 
A spin-off of information retrieval, known as text categorization, shares a similar research interest. 
Text categorization concerns associating documents with their classification terms or categories (Lewis, 
1992). Since in text categorization, categories are determined beforehand in such a way as to meet the 
user's specific tastes or needs, they may not serve as a topic or a theme in that they need not have a 
semantic relevance to the contents of documents. 
Technically, however, it is straightforward to move from text categorization to topic identification, 
provided that we are able to somehow isolate themes in texts and use them as categories to be assigned 
to texts. But the problem with using text categorization for topic identification, is that categories are 
arbitrarily given by humans, with no regard for documents that are to be classified. There is thus always 
a danger of misrepresenting documents. One possible way out is to choose categories not from outside 
of the documents but from within. The feasibility of the idea is explored in the paper. 
The use of text structure in information retrieval was motivated by the need for dealing with large 
documents, whose breadth of vocabulary may easily mislead the retrieval system into making a wrong 
101 
judgement about their relevancy to the query. Indeed, a new area of research known as passage retrieval 
has emerged to explore methods for using information from various levels of a document's tructure, 
e.g. sentences, sections, paragraphs, and other semantically or rhetorically motivated textual units. 
Wilkinson (1994) describes weighting methods that combine the similarity measure with various textual 
categories like abstract, purpose and supplementary, etc. Salton (1993) compares the full-text retrieval 
with the passage retrieval based on sections and paragraphs, and reports that the latter form of retrieval 
led to an increased effectiveness. Allan (1995) examines the usefulness of passage for relevance feedback, 
which concerns deriving or learning useful query terms from retrieved ocuments. Hearst (1993) is an 
interesting attempt o enhance the retrieval performance by using what they call a text tile, a discourse 
unit determined on the basis of the subject or content of the text. Callan (1994) proposes a hybrid 
approach of using both passage and document. 
Section 2 introduces the idea of bringing an IR technique to the topic identification task. Section 3 
discusses a problem that the proposed method shows poor performance on large documents. Section 4 
is a response to the problem: we propose the use of information on text structure to reduce irrelevancy 
in the document and increase ffectiveness. In Section 5, we conduct a set of experiments to determine 
whether the use of text structure has a positive effect on the performance. 
2. APPROACH TO TOP IC  IDENTIF ICAT ION 
Topic identification concerns the problem of identifying a topic of text with no information being given 
on the text's title or keywords whatsoever. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to the 
problem. We start with the definition of topic. Here we simply assume that a title term, or a noun 
that appears in the title, counts as a topic for the text. The reason is that it gives a clear cut, if not 
simple-minded, efinition of topic and lends itself easily to a statistical treatment. Thus what is involved 
in identifying a topic is a task of locating an instance of a title term. One might ask how we might locate 
an instance of topic without any information on the title or keywords. We take a probabilistic approach 
where you estimate the likelihood that a noun appears as a title term and choose among the best scoring 
nouns. Although it is quite possible to expand the notion of 'topic' to include nouns semantically related 
to title terms, the possibility is not explored here. 
The method we use for topic identification is basically one that is standardly used in research on text 
categorization, which aims at finding an effective way of classifying documents with predefined categories 
(Lewis, 1992). Roughly speaking, text categorization proceeds in two steps; first, for each of the given 
categories, estimate the likelihood that it is a correct category of a document, and second, decide whether 
to assign the category to the document based on the estimate; the rule is to use a suitable cutoff point 
to determine a choice. 
Now to adapt text categorization for use in topic identification requires a slight change in the for- 
mer. This is because in topic identification, we want to assign documents to nouns which occur in the 
document, rather than to categories given a priori. 
As mentioned above, topic identification is a two-part process; estimating and assigning. Let us 
explain a bit more about how the estimating works. We will talk about the assigning part later in the 
paper. We begin with some terminology. We call a word or an expression which classifies the text its 
potential topic and those that appear in the title actual topics. Let / : (c  I d) denote the likelihood that a 
document d is assigned to, or classified by a category c, W(d) a set of words or expressions comprising 
a text d, and S(d) a set of potential topics for d. Then the process of estimating consists in computing 
the likelihood value ~(c I d) for each c in S(d) such that S(d) C_ W(d). Later, we will be concerned with 
whether a particular choice of the set S(d) will in any way affect the performance on topic identification. 
102 
Following Iwayama et al(1994) and Fuhr (1989), we define the likelihood function by: 
?(c I d) = ~ P(c I t)P(tld) (1) 
t 
which is meant to be a relativization of the relationship between c and d to some index t (Fuhr, 1989); 
The index t could be anything from simple units such as a word, a bigram, or a trigram to more complex 
forms such as a phrase or a sentence. Put simply, the equation above says that the greater the number 
of indices associated with both c and d is, the more likely d is to predict c. In text categorization, a set 
of indices is said to represent a text. Assume that every index t will be assigned to some category. Then 
by Bayes' theorem, equation 1 can be transformed into: 
? (c ld )=P(c )  ~ P( t le )P ( t ld )  
teS(d) P(t) (2) 
We estimate the component probabilities by: 
P(c) = doc_f(D~)/doc_f(D) 
P(t I c) = F~(t) /token_f(D~) 
P(t l d ) = Fd(t) /token_f(d) 
P(t) = FD(t) /token_f(D) 
D is a collection of texts (news articles) found in the training corpus. Dc is a collection of texts in D 
whose title contains a term c. doc_f(D) is the count of texts in D. Similarly, doc_f(Dc) refers to the 
count of texts which have a term c in the title. Fc(t) is the frequency of an index t in De. token_f(D?) is 
the total count of word tokens in Dc, and similarly for token_f (d) and token_f (D). Fd(t) is the frequency 
of an index t in d. Finally, FD(t) is the frequency of an index t in D.

3. PROBLEM 
This section briefly discusses ome of the problems with the present approach to topic identification 
(Nomoto, 1995). A most serious problem is that as the length of a story increases, the model's perfor- 
mance quickly degrades. A cause of the problem appears to be an assumption we made that S(d) is 
equal to W(d), that is, that every noun in the text counts as a potential topic of text. As a consequence, 
an increase in text length results in a larger set of potential topics.

LENGTH 
Figure 3: The proportion of words in text against words in title. 
8 shows how the proportion of actual topics to indices (that is, TW~d)) ) changes with the increase Fig. 
in text length. (Information is based on the news articles in the test set we used in the experiments later. 
'100' denotes a set of news articles between 100 to 200 character long, '200' means news articles between 
200 to 300 character long, and similarly for others. The vertical dimension represents the proportion of 
words in text against words in title.) Since the title length stays rather constant over the test corpus, 
the possibility that an actual topic is identified by chance would be higher for short texts than for 
lengthy ones; we find 13% of indices to be actual at 100, while the rate goes down to 3% at 900. In the 
104 
following, we will investigate ways of reducing the size of S(d) without hurting the performance of topic 
identification. 
4. METHOD 
Our approach to the reduction problem above is to use a text structure to demarcate between relevant 
and irrelevant parts of text. Since newspaper articles in general do not have formal structure indicators, 
we use some similarity function to discover the structure of text. One such function is proposed by 
Hearst (1994), where a text structure is determined by measuring the similarity between adjacent blocks 
of text. Rather than to use a measure for within document similarity, the present approach chose to 
use a similarity measure between the text and its title to determine the structure of text. Behind this 
is an assumption that parts of the text most similar to its title would best represent i s content. Thus 
it is expected that discarding parts dissimilar to the title reduces irrelevancy in text, contributing to an 
improvement on the performance. 
Let .T(d) be a complete set of non-overlapping text segments comprising a document d. Let d E 9V(d) 
and h be a title associated with the document d. Then the similarity between a headline and text 
segment is given by the usual t f .  idf measurement (Wilkinson, 1994): 
N 
SIM( h, d) = E ntftd " idft 
i=O 
N is the number of words that appear in h. ntf t  d is a normalized term frequency of t in d, which is given 
by: 
tfta 
nt f t  d - -  _ _  max_t f d 
where tftd denotes a frequency of the term t in d and max_tfd the frequency of the most frequent erm 
in d. 
= log  
log df 
tdf is the number of segments which have an occurrence of t. df is the total number of segments in 
d. log df is a normalization factor. Further, any repetitions of words are removed from the title. The 
length of a segment d is fixed at 10 words in the experiments. The idea of idf or the inverse document 
frequency is to give more points to words which have a localized distribution, that is, those that appear 
only in some of the documents and not others. 
Fig. 4 shows similarity graphs for news articles published from January, 1992 through April, 1992 
(Nihon-Keizai-Shimbun-Sha, 1992). Each graph corresponds to articles of a particular length; the one 
marked with '100-200' means that it is for articles from 100 to 200 character long. Since the test sets 
we used in the later experiments of topic identification ranges from 100 to 1000 characters in length, the 
title/block similarity is measured only for the relevant sizes. 't '  denotes the number of articles considered. 
We divided each news article into a set of 10-word segments ordered according to their appearance. 
For each of the 10-word segments contained in the text, we measured its similarity to the title. The 
horizontal dimension represents a position at which a segment appears. A segment at x = 5, for instance, 
spans the 40th to the 49th word of text. The vertical dimension gives the probability that a segment at a 
particular position is chosen as most similar to the title. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the initial portion of 
text is more likely to be chosen as most similar to the title than other parts of text; the later a segment 
appears in text, the less chance it has of being selected as most similar to the title. 
In terms of the rhetorical structure theory (RST)(Fox, 1987), the results could be interpreted as 
indicating a stylistic norm particular to the newspaper domain, i.e., that the main claim is presented in

the beginning of the article, followed by supplemental materials. Consider, for instance, a sample news 
article given in Fig. 1. Since it does not affect points of the discussion, the English translation is used 
here for the convenience. The article consists of a title (1) plus two sentences(2,3). 
(1) Major French Bank opens office in Kiev. 
(2) Societg General, a major French bank, disclosed on the 15th a plan to open a resident office in 
Kiev, capital of Ukraine. 
(3) The bank has already obtained a permission from the city authority, sources ay. 
Considering the title (1), it is fair to say that the first sentence constitutes a main news of the article, 
while the second is its elaboration, providing supplementary details about the news. 
In RST, the article would be analyzed as having an Issue structure, which consists of one nucleus and 
some adjuncts. A nucleus is a set of clauses that presents a main claim of the text, something that makes 
the text newsworthy, while an adjunct supplements he main claim with some background or ancillary 
information. Fig. 5 shows a diagrammatic representation f the article along the lines of Fox (1987).

In fact the results of the experiments shown in Fig. 4 give some ground for believing that texts from 
the newspaper domain, as a rule, take a rhetorical structure similar to Fig. 5 such as one in Fig. 6, where 
the nucleus appears at the beginning of the text, followed by any number of supplementary adjuncts. 
In the light of this, we have conducted a series of experiments to determine whether discarding rear 
portions of text affects the performance of topic identification. 
5. EXPERIMENTS 
We have conducted a set of experiments to see how a full-text and "discard" model compare in terms 
of the performance on the topic identification task. Our experiments used the total of 43,253 full-text 
news articles from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese business daily (Nihon-Keizai-Shimbun-Sha, 1992). 
All of the articles appeared in the first half of the year 1992. Of these, 40,553 articles, which appeared 
on May 31, 1992 and earlier, were used for training and the remaining 2,700 articles, which appeared on 
June 1, 1992 or later, were used for testing. 
A training set and a test set were obtained by extracting nouns from the newspaper corpus, which 
involves as a sub-step tokenizing each article into a set of words. The procedure was carried out with 
the tokenizer program JUMAN. The resultant raining set contained some 2.5 million words excluding 
stop words. 
The test set was then divided into nine subsets of news articles according to the length. Each subset 
contained 300 articles. In Table 1, the test set 1, for instance, consists of articles, each of which which 
contains from 100 to 200 characters. The test set 2, on the other hand, consists of larger articles, which 
are between 200 and 300 character long.

Table 1: Test Sets 
In the experiments, we were interested in finding out the effectiveness of a segment model which 
considers a starting block of the article and ignores everything else. Here we tried two approaches; one 
is based on a fixed-length segment and the other on a proportional-length segment. The fixed-length 
approach uses the first i words of the text, i being constant across texts, whereas the proportional- 
length approach uses the first j% of words contained in the text, so that the actual length of segment is

proportional to that of the whole text. 
Table 2 and Table 3 show break even points of experiments using the fixed-length and proportional- 
length strategies, respectively. A break even point is a highest point where recall and precision is equal. 
It is meant as a summary figure of the performance. Precision and recall are determined for each text 
in the test set, by the formulae below: 
the number of words correctly identified as title words Precision = 
the number of words assigned 
the number of words correctly identified as title words Recall = 
the number of actual topics 
We use a assigning strategy called probabilistic thresholding (Lewis, 1992) to decide what words to 
be assigned to the text as potential title indicators. Basically, what we do is to pick up a thresholding 
constant k and assign words whose probability of being a title word is greater than k. Typically, a large 
value of k gives high recall and low precision, while the opposite is the case with a small value of k. A 
break even point is obtained by varying the value of k. 
Returning to Table 2 and Table 3, i indicates the size of segment, and I the length of text. The 
'+/ - '  figure next to each break even point indicates the improvement (or drop) as compared to a topic 
identification task using full texts. The asterisk ' . '  means that no break even point was found for the 
associated experiment and the precision at the highest recall is listed instead (the highest recall is given 
parenthetically). In case that the length of a text is smaller than that of the segment, he whole text is 
used. 
108 
The column labelled "10" in Table 2 is the result of applying a segment model which considers the 
starting 10-word block from a text. The table shows that at i = 10, there were no break even points 
found for texts with more than 400 characters (1 > 400). 
Both the FLM and PLM approaches produced an improvement over the full-text model. Discarding 
rear portions of a text turns out to be more effective for large texts (1 > 200) than for short texts 
(100 < l < 200). However, the effectiveness of the "discard" strategy slowly declines as the text length 
increases. In Table 2, for instance, the effectiveness falls from .42 to .32 at i = 20. The distribution of 
similarity measurements for large texts in Fig. 4 suggests that the similarity distribution for large texts 
tend to be less skewed to the left than that for short texts. This would mean that title-indicating terms 
are scattered more evenly over the text, and thus it becomes all the more difficult to demarcate between 
relevant and irrelevant parts of the text. 
A problem with the PLM approach is that a segment from which topical words are chosen is too 
small for short texts. Thus at 20%, for instance, its performance on 100-200 character texts drops by 
17% compared to the full-text approach, but gradually improves as the value of j increases. (See Table 3 
and Fig. 8). Interestingly enough, the situation turns around when l is large and j is small: thus at 
j = 20, there is a 20 % increase for 500 < l < 600 but a 17 % decrease for 100 < l < 200. 
The results of experiments using paragraphs are shown in Fig. 4. The experiments used the first 
paragraph of a text as a segment. Though the use of paragraph achieved better results at some points 
(300-400 and 500-600) than other approaches, the overall performance is not outstanding compared to 
either FLM or PLM. In particular, the 'first paragraph' strategy is outperformed by the full-text method

6. F INAL  REMARKS 
Two major benefits of using text structure in topic identification are an improvement in effectiveness 
and a considerable reduction of the text volume necessary for the correct identification of text topics. 
For instance, a fixed-length model using the first 20-word block requires only about one tenth of the 
words that are used in a full-text model and still performs ignificantly and consistently better than the 
latter. Contrary to our expectation, the results of the experiments cast some doubt as to the usefulness 
of paragraphs for topic identification. 
Fig. 10 shows a particular implementation of the present method (full-text model), which operates 
in the Emacs environment. The article shown in Fig. 10 is from Nihon Keizai Shimbun (1992). 
As a conclusion, let us mention a few points. The present paper demonstrated that evidence on text 
structure nhanced the performance on the identification of topical words in texts, which is based on a 
probabilistic model of text categorization. Importantly, we used texts which are not explicitly structured. 
A text structure is identified by measuring the similarity between segments comprising the text and its 
title. It was shown clearly that a text structure thus identified gives a good clue to finding out parts of 
the text most relevant o its content.
