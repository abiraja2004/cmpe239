Abstract 
This paper studies sentiment analysis 
from the user-generated content on the 
Web. In particular, it focuses on mining 
opinions from comparative sentences, i.e., 
to determine which entities in a compari-
son are preferred by its author. A typical 
comparative sentence compares two or 
more entities. For example, the sentence, 
?the picture quality of Camera X is better 
than that of Camera Y?, compares two 
entities ?Camera X? and ?Camera Y? 
with regard to their picture quality. Clear-
ly, ?Camera X? is the preferred entity. 
Existing research has studied the problem 
of extracting some key elements in a 
comparative sentence. However, there is 
still no study of mining opinions from 
comparative sentences, i.e., identifying 
preferred entities of the author. This pa-
per studies this problem, and proposes a 
technique to solve the problem. Our ex-
periments using comparative sentences 
from product reviews and forum posts 
show that the approach is effective. 
1 Introduction 
In the past few years, there was a growing inter-
est in mining opinions in the user-generated con-
tent (UGC) on the Web, e.g., customer reviews, 
forum posts, and blogs. One major focus is sen-
timent classification and opinion mining (e.g., 
Pang et al2002; Turney 2002; Hu and Liu 2004; 
Wilson et al2004; Kim and Hovy 2004; Popescu 
and Etzioni 2005)

However, these studies mainly center on direct 
opinions or sentiments expressed on entities. Lit-
tle study has been done on comparisons, which 
represent another type of opinion-bearing text. 
Comparisons are related to but are also quite dif-
ferent from direct opinions. For example, a typi-
cal direct opinion sentence is ?the picture quality 
of Camera X is great?, while a typical compara-
tive sentence is ?the picture quality of Camera X 
is better than that of Camera Y.? We can see that 
comparisons use different language constructs 
from direct opinions. A comparison typically 
expresses a comparative opinion on two or more 
entities with regard to their shared features or 
attributes, e.g., ?picture quality?. Although direct 
opinions are most common in UGC, comparisons 
are also widely used (about 10% of the sen-
tences), especially in forum discussions where 
users often ask questions such as ?X vs. Y? (X 
and Y are competing products). Discussions are 
then centered on comparisons.  
Jindal and Liu (2006) proposed a technique to 
identify comparative sentences from reviews and 
forum posts, and to extract entities, comparative 
words, and entity features that are being com-
pared. For example, in the sentence, ?Camera X 
has longer battery life than Camera Y?, the 
technique extracts ?Camera X? and ?Camera Y? 
as entities, and ?longer? as the comparative 
word and ?battery life? as the attribute of the 
cameras being compared. However, the tech-
nique does not find which entity is preferred by 
the author. For this example, clearly ?Camera Y? 
is the preferred camera with respect to the ?bat-
tery life? of the cameras. This paper aims to 
solve this problem, which is useful in many ap-
plications because the preferred entity is the key 
piece of information in a comparative opinion. 
For example, a potential customer clearly wants 
to buy the product that is better or preferred.  
In this work, we treat a sentence as the basic 
241
information unit. Our objective is thus to identify 
the preferred entity in each comparative sentence. 
A useful observation about comparative sen-
tences is that in each such sentence there is 
usually a comparative word (e.g., ?better?, 
?worse? and ?er word) or a superlative word 
(e.g., ?best?, ?worst? and ?est word). The entities 
being compared often appear on the two sides of 
the comparative word. A superlative sentence 
may only have one entity, e.g., ?Camera X is the 
best?. For simplicity, we use comparative words 
(sentences) to mean both comparative words 
(sentences) and superlative words (sentences). 
Clearly, the preferred entity in a comparative 
sentence is mainly determined by the compara-
tive word in the sentence. Some comparative 
words explicitly indicate user preferences, e.g., 
?better?, ?worse?, and ?best?. We call such 
words opinionated comparative words. For ex-
ample, in the sentence, ?the picture quality of 
Camera X is better than that of Camera Y?, 
Camera X is preferred due to the opinionated 
comparative word ?better?.  
However, many comparative words are not 
opinionated, or their opinion orientations (i.e., 
positive or negative) depend on the context 
and/or the application domain. For instance, the 
word ?longer? is not opinionated as it is normal-
ly used to express that the length of some feature 
of an entity is greater than the length of the same 
feature of another entity. However, in a particular 
context, it can express a desired (or positive) or 
undesired (or negative) state. For example, in the 
sentence, ?the battery life of Camera X is longer 
than Camera Y?, ?longer? clearly expresses a 
desired state for ?battery life? (although this is an 
objective sentence with no explicit opinion). 
?Camera X? is thus preferred with regard to 
?battery life? of the cameras. The opinion in this 
sentence is called an implicit opinion. We also 
say that ?longer? is positive in this context. We 
know this because of our existing domain know-
ledge. However, ?longer? may also be used to 
express an undesirable state in a different context, 
e.g., ?Program X?s execution time is longer than 
Program Y?. longer? is clearly negative here. 
?Program Y? is thus preferred. We call compara-
tive words such as ?longer? and ?smaller? con-
text-dependent opinion comparatives.  
Sentences with opinionated words (e.g., ?bet-
ter?, and ?worse?) are usually easy to handle. 
Then the key to solve our problem is to identify 
the opinion orientations (positive or negative) of 
context-dependent comparative words. To this 
end, two questions need to be answered: (1) what 
is a context and (2) how to use the context to 
help determine the opinion orientation of a com-
parative word?  
The simple answer to question (1) is the whole 
sentence. However, a whole sentence as context 
is too complex because it may contain too much 
irrelevant information, which can confuse the 
system. Intuitively, we want to use the smallest 
context that can determine the orientation of the 
comparative word. Obviously, the comparative 
word itself must be involved. We thus conjecture 
that the context should consist of the entity fea-
ture being compared and the comparative word. 
Our experimental results show that this context 
definition works quite well.   
To answer the second question, we need ex-
ternal information or knowledge because there is 
no way that a computer program can solve the 
problem by analyzing the sentence itself. In this 
paper, we propose to use the external information 
in customer reviews on the Web to help solve the 
problem. There are a large number of such re-
views on almost any product or service. These 
reviews can be readily downloaded from many 
sites. In our work, we use reviews from epi-
nions.com. Each review in epinions.com has sep-
arate Pros and Cons (which is also the case in 
most other review sites). Thus, positive and 
negative opinions are known as they are sepa-
rated by reviewers. However, they cannot be 
used directly because Pros and Cons seldom con-
tain comparative words. We need to deal with 
this problem. Essentially, the proposed method 
computes whether the comparative word and the 
feature are more associated in Pros or in Cons. If 
they are more associated in Pros (or Cons) than 
Cons (or Pros), then the comparative word is 
likely to be positive (or negative) for the feature. 
A new association measure is also proposed to 
suit our purpose. Our experiment results show 
that it can achieve high precision and recall.  
2 Related Work 
Sentiment analysis has been studied by many 
researchers recently. Two main directions are 
sentiment classification at the document and sen-
tence levels, and feature-based opinion mining. 
Sentiment classification at the document level 
investigates ways to classify each evaluative 
document (e.g., product review) as positive or 
negative (Pang et al2002; Turney 2002). Senti-
ment classification at the sentence-level has also 
been studied (e.g., Riloff and Wiebe 2003; Kim 
and Hovy 2004; Wilson et al2004; Gamon et al
242
2005; Stoyanov and Cardie 2006). These works 
are different from ours as we study comparatives.    
The works in (Hu and Liu 2004; Liu et al2005; 
Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Mei et al2007) per-
form opinion mining at the feature level. The 
task involves (1) extracting entity features (e.g., 
?picture quality? and ?battery life? in a camera 
review) and (2) finding orientations (positive, 
negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on the 
features by reviewers. Again, our work is differ-
ent because we deal with comparisons.  
Discovering orientations of context dependent 
opinion comparative words is related to identify-
ing domain opinion words (Hatzivassiloglou and 
McKeown 1997; Kanayama and Nasukawa 
2006). Both works use conjunction rules to find 
such words from large domain corpora. One con-
junction rule states that when two opinion words 
are linked by ?and?, their opinions are the same. 
Our method is different in three aspects. First, we 
argue that finding domain opinion words is prob-
lematic because in the same domain the same 
word may indicate different opinions depending 
on what features it is applied to. For example, in 
the camera domain, ?long? is positive in ?the 
battery life is very long? but negative in ?it takes 
a long time to focus?. Thus, we should consider 
both the feature and the opinion word rather than 
only the opinion word. Second, we focus on 
studying opinionated comparative words. Third, 
our technique is quite different as we utilize rea-
dily available external opinion sources.  
As discussed in the introduction, a closely re-
lated work to ours is (Jindal and Liu 2006). 
However, it does not find which entities are pre-
ferred by authors. Bos and Nissim (2006) pro-
poses a method to extract some useful items from 
superlative sentences. Fiszman et al(2007) stu-
died the problem of identifying which entity has 
more of certain features in comparative sen-
tences. It does not find which entity is preferred.  
3 Problem Statement 
Definition (entity and feature): An entity is the 
name of a person, a product, a company, a lo-
cation, etc, under comparison in a compara-
tive sentence. A feature is a part or attribute 
of the entity that is being compared. 
For example, in the sentence, ?Camera X?s bat-
tery life is longer than that of Camera Y?, ?Cam-
era X? and ?Camera Y? are entities and ?battery 
life? is the camera feature.  
Types of Comparatives 
1)  Non-equal gradable: Relations of the type 
greater or less than that express a total order-
ing of some entities with regard to their 
shared features. For example, the sentence, 
?Camera X?s battery life is longer than that of 
Camera Y?, orders ?Camera X? and ?Camera 
Y? based on their shared feature ?battery life?.  
2)  Equative: Relations of the type equal to that 
state two objects as equal with respect to 
some features, e.g., ?Camera X and Camera Y 
are about the same size?.  
3)  Superlative: Relations of the type greater or 
less than all others that rank one object over 
all others, ?Camera X?s battery life is the 
longest?. 
4)  Non-gradable: Sentences which compare fea-
tures of two or more entities, but do not expli-
citly grade them, e.g., ?Camera X and Cam-
era Y have different features?  
The first three types are called gradable compar-
atives. This paper focuses on the first and the 
third types as they express ordering relationships 
of entities. Equative and non-gradable sentences 
usually do not express preferences.  
Definition (comparative relation): A compara-
tive relation is the following:  
<ComparativeWord, Features, EntityS1, EntityS2, Type> 
ComparativeWord is the keyword used to ex-
press a comparative relation in the sentence. Fea-
tures is a set of features being compared. En-
tityS1 and EntityS2 are sets of entities being 
compared. Entities in EntityS1 appear on the left 
of the comparative word and entities in EntityS2 
appear on the right. Type is non-equal gradable, 
equative or superlative. Let us see an example. 
For the sentence ?Camera X has longer battery 
life than Camera Y,? the extracted relation is:  
<longer, {battery life}, {Camera X}, {Camera Y}, 
non-equal gradable>.  
We assume that the work in (Jindal and Liu 2006) 
has extracted the above relation from a compara-
tive sentence. In this work, we aim to identify the 
preferred entity of the author, which is not stu-
died in (Jindal and Liu 2006).  
Our objective: Given the extracted comparative 
relation from a comparative sentence, we want 
to identify whether the entities in EntityS1 or 
in EntityS2 are preferred by the author.  
4 Proposed Technique 
We now present the proposed technique. As dis-
cussed above, the primary determining factors of 
the preferred entity in a comparative sentence are 
243
the feature being compared and the comparative 
word, which we conjecture, form the context for 
opinions (or preferred entities). We develop our 
ideas from here.  
4.1 Comparatives and superlatives 
In English, comparatives and superlatives are 
special forms of adjectives and adverbs. In gen-
eral, comparatives are formed by adding the suf-
fix ?-er? and superlatives are formed by adding 
the suffix ??est? to the base adjectives and ad-
verbs. We call this type of comparatives and su-
perlatives Type 1 comparatives and superlatives. 
For simplicity, we will use Type 1 comparatives 
to represent both from now on.  
Adjectives and adverbs with two syllables or 
more and not ending in y do not form compara-
tives or superlatives by adding ??er? or ??est?. 
Instead, ?more?, ?most?, ?less? and ?least? are 
used before such words, e.g., ?more beautiful?. 
We call this type of comparatives and superla-
tives Type 2 comparatives and Type 2 superla-
tives. These two types are called regular com-
paratives and superlatives respectively.  
In English, there are also some irregular com-
paratives and superlatives, which do not follow 
the above rules, i.e., ?more?, ?most?, ?less?, 
?least?, ?better?, ?best?, ?worse?, ?worst?, ?fur-
ther/farther? and ?furthest/farthest?. They be-
have similarly to Type 1 comparatives and super-
latives and thus are grouped under Type 1.  
Apart from these comparatives and superla-
tives, there are non-standard words that express 
gradable comparisons, e.g., ?prefer?, and ?supe-
rior?. For example, the sentence, ?in term of bat-
tery life, Camera X is superior to Camera Y?, 
says that ?Camera X? is preferred. We obtained a 
list of 27 such words from (Jindal and Liu 2006) 
(which used more words, but most of them are 
not used to express gradable comparisons). Since 
these words behave similarly to Type 1 compara-
tives, they are thus grouped under Type 1. 
Further analysis also shows that we can group 
comparatives into two categories according to 
whether they express increased or decreased val-
ues: 
Increasing comparatives: Such a comparative 
expresses an increased value of a quantity, e.g., 
?more?, and ?longer?.  
Decreasing comparatives: Such a comparative 
expresses a decreased value of a quantity, e.g., 
?less?, and ?fewer?.  
As we will see later, this categorization is very 
useful in identifying the preferred entity.  
Since comparatives originate from adjectives 
and adverbs, they may carry positive or negative 
sentiments/opinions. Along this dimension, we 
can divide them into two categories.   
1.  Opinionated comparatives: For Type 1 com-
paratives, this category contains words such 
as "better", "worse", etc, which has explicit 
opinions. In sentences involving such words, 
it is normally easy to determine which entity 
is the preferred one of the sentence author.  
In the case of Type 2 comparatives, formed 
by adding ?more?, ?less?, ?most?, and ?least? 
before adjectives or adverbs, the opinion (or 
preferred entity) is determined by both words. 
The following rules apply: 
?increasing comparative? Negative  ?  Negative Opinion 
?increasing comparative? Positive   ?  Positive Opinion 
?decreasing comparative? Negative ?  Positive Opinion 
?decreasing comparative? Positive  ?  Negative Opinion 
 The first rule says that the combination of an 
increasing comparative word (e.g., ?more?) 
and a negative opinion adjective/adverb (e.g., 
?awful?) implies a negative Type 2 compara-
tive. The other rules are similar. These rules 
are intuitive and will not be discussed further.  
2.  Comparatives with context-dependent opi-
nions: These comparatives are used to com-
pare gradable quantities of entities. In the case 
of Type 1 comparatives, such words include 
?higher?, ?lower?, etc. Although they do not 
explicitly describe the opinion of the author, 
they often carry implicit sentiments or prefe-
rences based on contexts. For example, in 
?Car X has higher mileage per gallon than 
Car Y?, it is hard to know whether ?higher? is 
positive or negative without domain know-
ledge. It is only when the two words, ?higher? 
and ?mileage?, are combined we know that 
?higher? is desirable for ?mileage? from our 
domain knowledge.  
In the case of Type 2 comparatives, the sit-
uation is similar. However, the comparative 
word (?more?, ?most?, ?less? or ?least?), the 
adjective/adverb and the feature are all impor-
tant in determining the opinion or the prefe-
rence. If we know whether the comparative 
word is increasing or decreasing (which is 
easy since there are only four such words), 
then the opinion can be determined by apply-
ing the four rules above in (1).  
For this work, we used the opinion word list 
from (Hu and Liu 2004), which was compiled 
using a bootstrapping approach based on Word-
Net. For opinionated comparatives, due to the 
observation below we simply convert the opinion 
244
adjectives/adverbs to their comparative forms, 
which is done automatically based on grammar 
(comparative formation) rules described above 
and WordNet. 
Observation: If a word is positive (or negative), 
then its comparative or superlative form is al-
so positive (or negative), e.g., ?good?, ?bet-
ter? and ?best?.  
After the conversion, these words are manually 
categorized into increasing and decreasing com-
paratives. Although this consumes some time, it 
is only a one-time effort.  
4.2 Contexts 
To deal with comparatives with context depen-
dent opinions, we need contexts. It is conjectured 
that the comparative and the feature in the sen-
tence form the context. This works very well. For 
a Type 2 comparative, we only need the feature 
and the adjective/adverb to form a context. For 
example, in the sentence, ?Program X runs more 
quickly than Program Y?, the context is the pair, 
(?run?, ?quickly?), where ?run? is a verb feature. 
If we find out that (?run?, ?quickly?) is positive 
based on some external information, we can con-
clude that ?Program X? is preferred using one of 
the four rules above since ?more? is an increas-
ing comparative.  
We will use such contexts to find opinion 
orientations of comparatives with regard to some 
features from the external information, i.e., Pros 
and Cons in online reviews. 
4.3 Pros and Cons in Reviews 
Figure 1 shows a popular review format. The 
reviewer first describes Pros and Cons briefly, 
and then writes a full review.  
Pros and Cons are used in our work for two 
main reasons. First, the brief information in Pros 
and Cons contains the essential information re-
lated to opinions. Each phrase or sentence seg-
ment usually contains an entity feature and an 
opinion word. Second, depending on whether it 
is in Pros or in Cons, the user opinion on the 
product feature is clear.  
To use the Pros and Cons phrases, we separate 
them use punctuations and words, i.e., ?,?, ?.?, 
?and?, and ?but?. Pros in Figure 1 can be sepa-
rated into 5 phrases or segments,  
great photos  <photo>   
easy to use    <use> 
good manual  <manual> 
many options <option> 
takes videos <video> 
We can see that each segment describes an entity 
feature on which the reviewer has expressed an 
opinion. The entity feature for each segment is 
listed within <>. 
4.4 Identifying Preferred Entities: The Al-
gorithm 
Since we use Pros and Cons as the external in-
formation source to help determine whether the 
combination of a comparative and an entity fea-
ture is positive or negative, we need to find com-
parative and entity features words in Pros and 
Cons. However, in Pros and Cons, comparatives 
are seldom used (entity features are always 
there). Thus we need to first convert compara-
tives to their base forms. This can be done auto-
matically using WordNet and grammar rules de-
scribed in Section 4.1. We will not discuss the 
process here as it is fairly straightforward.     
We now put everything together to identify the 
preferred entity in a comparative sentence. For 
easy reference, we denote the comparative word 
as C and the feature being compared as F. After 
obtaining the base forms of C, we work on two 
main cases for the two types of comparatives:  
Case 1. Type 1 Comparative or Superlative: 
There are four sub-cases.  
1.A. C is opinionated: If the comparative or su-
perlative C has a positive orientation (e.g., 
?better?), EntityS1 (which appears before C 
in the sentence) is temporarily assigned as the 
preferred entity. Otherwise, EntityS2 is as-
signed as the preferred entity. The reason for 
the temporary assignment is that the sentence 
may contain negations, e.g., ?not?, which is 
discussed below.   
1.B. C is not opinionated but F is opinionated: 
An example is, ?Car X generates more noise 
than Car Y?, which has the feature F ?noise?, 
a negative noun. If the orientation of F is 
positive and C is an increasing comparative 
word, we assign EntityS1 as the preferred ent-
ity. Otherwise, we assign EntityS2 as the pre-
ferred entity. The possibilities are listed as 
four rules below, which are derived from the 
4 rules earlier: 
?increasing C? + Positive ? EntityS1 preferred 
?decreasing C? + Positive ? EntityS2 preferred 
 
Figure 1: An example review  
245
?increasing C? + Negative ? EntityS2 preferred 
?decreasing C? + Negative ? EntityS1 preferred 
?Positive? and ?Negative? stand for the orien-
tation of feature F being positive and negative 
respectively.  
1.C. Both C and F are not opinionated: In this 
case, we need external information to identify 
the preferred entity. We use phrases in Pros 
and Cons from reviews.  
In this case, we look for the feature F and 
comparative word C, (i.e., the context) in the 
list of phrases in Pros and Cons. In order to 
find whether the combination of C and F indi-
cates a positive or negative opinion, we com-
pute their associations in Pros and in Cons. If 
they are more associated in Pros than in Cons, 
we conclude that the combination indicates a 
positive sentiment, and otherwise a negative 
sentiment. The result decides the preferred 
entity. Point-wise mutual information (PMI) 
is commonly used for computing the associa-
tion of two terms (e.g., Turney 2002), which 
is defined as:  
?????, ?? ? ???
????, ??
??????????
. 
However, we argue that PMI is not a suitable 
measure for our purpose. The reason is that 
PMI is symmetric in the sense that PMI(F, C) 
is the same as PMI(C, F). However, in our 
case, the feature F and comparative word C 
association is not symmetric because although 
a feature is usually modified by a particular 
adjective word, the adjective word can modify 
many other features. For example, ?long? can 
be used in ?long lag?, but it can also be used 
in ?long battery life?, ?long execution time? 
and many others. Thus, this association is 
asymmetric. We are more interested in the 
conditional probability of C (including its 
synonyms) given F, which is essentially the 
confidence measure in traditional data mining. 
However, confidence does not handle well the 
situation where C occurs frequently but F ap-
pears rarely. In such cases a high conditional 
probability Pr(C|F) may just represent some 
pure chance, and consequently the resulting 
association may be spurious. We propose the 
following measure, which we call one-side 
association (OSA), and it works quite well: 
?????, ?? ? ???
????, ??????|??
??????????
 
The difference between OSA and PMI is the 
conditional probability Pr(C|F) used in OSA, 
which biases the mutual association of F and 
C to one side.  
Given the comparative word C and the fea-
ture F, we first compute an OSA value for 
positive, denoted by OSAP(F, C), and then 
compute an OSA value for negative, denoted 
by OSAN(F, C). The decision rule is simply 
the following: 
If OSAP(F, C) ? OSAN(F, C) ? 0 then  
EntityS1 is preferred 
Otherwise,  EntityS2 is preferred 
Computing OSAP(F, C): We need to compute 
PrP(F, C), for which we need to count the 
number of times that comparative word C and 
the feature F co-occur. Instead of using C 
alone, we also use its base forms and syn-
onyms and antonyms. Similarly, for F, we al-
so use its synonyms. If C (or a synonym of C) 
and F (or a synonym) co-occur in a Pros 
phrase, we count 1. If an antonym of C and F 
(or a synonym) co-occur in a Cons phrase, we 
also count 1. Thus, although we only evaluate 
for positive, we actually use both Pros and 
Cons. This is important because it allows us 
to find more occurrences to produce more re-
liable results. Synonyms and antonyms are 
obtained from WordNet. Currently, synonyms 
and antonyms are only found for single word 
features.  
We then count the number of occurrences of 
the comparative word C and the feature F 
separately in both Pros and Cons to compute 
PrP(F) and PrP(C). In counting the number of 
occurrences of C, we consider both its syn-
onyms in Pros and antonyms in Cons. In 
counting the number of occurrences of F, we 
consider its synonyms in both Pros and Cons.  
Computing OSAN(F, C): To compute PrN(F, 
C), we use a similar strategy as for computing 
PrP(F, C). In this case, we start with Cons.  
1.D. C is a feature indicator: An example sen-
tence is ?Camera X is smaller than Camera 
Y?, where ?smaller? is the feature indicator 
for feature ?size?. In this case, we simply 
count the number of times (denoted by n+) 
that C appears in Pros and the number of 
times (denoted by n-) that C appears in Cons. 
If n+ ? n-, we temporarily assign EntityS1 as 
the preferred entity. Otherwise, we assign En-
tityS2 as the preferred entity. Note that in 
some sentences, the entity features do not ap-
pear explicitly in the sentences but are im-
plied. The words that imply the features are 
called feature indicators.  
246
Case 2: Type 2 Comparative or Superlative: 
There are two sub-cases: 
2.A. Adjective/adverb in the comparison is opi-
nionated: In this case, the feature F is not im-
portant. An example sentence is: 
?Car X has more beautiful interior than Car Y?, 
?more? is an increasing comparative, and 
?beautiful? is the adjective with a positive 
orientation (the feature F is ?interior?). ?Car 
X? is clearly preferred in this case.  
Another example is: ?Car X is more beautiful 
than Car Y?. In this case, ?beautiful? is a fea-
ture indicator for the feature ?appearance?. 
Again, ?Car X? is preferred. This sub-case 
can be handled similarly as case 1.B. 
2.B. adjective/adverb in the comparison is not 
opinionated: If the adjective/adverb in com-
parison is a feature indicator, we can use the 
method in 1.D. Otherwise, we form a context 
using the feature and adjective/adverb, and 
apply the method in 1.C. We then combine 
the result with the comparative word before 
the adjective/adverb to decide based on the 
rules in 1.B.  
Negations: The steps above temporarily deter-
mine which entity is the preferred entity. How-
ever, a comparative sentence may contain a ne-
gation word or phrase (we have compiled 26 of 
them), e.g., ?Camera X?s battery life is not long-
er than that of Camera Y.? Without considering 
?not?, ?Camera X? is preferred. After consider-
ing ?not?, we assign the preferred entity to 
?Camera Y?. This decision may be problematic 
because ?not longer? does not mean ?shorter? 
(thus it can also be seen to have no preference). 
5 Evaluation 
A system, called PCS (Preferred entities in 
Comparative Sentences), has been implemented 
based the proposed method. Since there is no 
existing system that can perform the task, we 
could not compare with an existing approach. 
Below, we first describe the evaluation datasets 
and then present the results. 
5.1 Evaluation Datasets 
Our comparative sentence dataset consists of two 
subsets. The first subset is from (Jindal and Liu 
2006), which are product review and forum dis-
cussion sentences on digital cameras, DVD play-
ers, MP3 players, Intel vs AMD, Coke vs Pepsi, 
and Microsoft vs Google. The original dataset 
used in (Jindal and Liu 2006) also contains many 
non-gradable comparative sentences, which are 
not used here as most such sentences do not ex-
press any preferences.  
To make the data more diverse, we collected 
more forum discussion data about mobile phones 
from http://www.howardforums.com/, and re-
views from amazon.com and cnet.com on prod-
ucts such as laptops, cameras and mobile phones. 
Table 1 gives the number of sentences from these 
two sources. Although we only have 837 com-
parative sentences, they were collected from 
thousands of sentences in reviews and forums. 
About 10% of the sentences from them are com-
parative sentences.  
Skewed Distribution: An interesting observa-
tion about comparative sentences is that a large 
proportion (based on our data) of them (84%) has 
EntityS1 as the preferred entity. This means that 
when people make comparisons, they tend to put 
the preferred entities first.  
Pros and Cons corpus: The Pros and Cons 
corpus was crawled from reviews of epi-
nions.com. It has 15162 Pros and 15162 Cons 
extracted from 15162 reviews of three types of 
products, i.e., digital cameras (8479), and prin-
ters (5778), and Strollers (905).

5.2 Results 
The results on the whole dataset are given in Ta-
ble 2. Note that 84% of the sentences have En-
tityS1 as the preferred entity. If a system does 
nothing but simply announces that EntityS1 is 
preferred, we will have the accuracy of 84%. 
However, PCS using the OSA measure achieves 
the accuracy of 94.4%, which is much better than 
the baseline of taking the majority. Since in 
skewed datasets accuracy does not reflect the 
prediction well, we will mainly use precision 
(Prec.), recall (Rec.) and F-score (F) in evalua-
tion. For the case that EntityS1 is preferred, the 
algorithm does extremely well. For the case that 
EntityS2 is preferred, the algorithm also does 
well although not as well as for the EntityS1 case. 
Based on our observation, we found that in such 
cases, the sentences are usually more complex.  
Next, we compare with the case that the sys-
tem does not use Pros and Cons (then OSA or 
PMI is not needed) (row 2). When a sentence 
requires context dependency handling, the sys-
tem simply takes the majority as the default, i.e., 
247
assigning EntityS1 as the preferred entity. From 
the results in Table 2, we can see that F-scores 
are all worse. In the case that EntityS1 is the pre-
ferred entity, taking defaults is not so bad, which 
is not surprising because of the skewed data dis-
tribution. Even in this case, the precision im-
provement of PCS(OSA) is statistically signifi-
cant at the 95% confidence level. The recall is 
slight less but their difference is not statistically 
significant. When EntityS2 is the preferred entity, 
its F-score (row 2) is much worse, which shows 
that our technique is effective. The recall im-
provement of PCS (OSA) is dramatic (statistical-
ly significant at the 95% confidence level). The 
two precisions are not statistically different. For 
OSA vs. PMI, see below.  
Table 2: Preferred entity identification: whole data 
 
 
EntityS1 Preferred EntityS2 Preferred
Prec. Rec. F Prec. Rec. F
PCS (OSA) 0.967 0.966 0.966 0.822 0.828 0.825
PCS: No Pros & 
Cons 0.925 0.980 0.952 0.848 0.582 0.690
PCS (PMI) 0.967 0.961 0.964 0.804 0.828 0.816
Now let us look at only the 187 sentences that 
need context dependency handling. The data is 
still skewed. 72.2% of the sentences have En-
tityS1 as the preferred entities. Table 3 shows the 
results of PCS with and without using Pros and 
Cons. The results of PCS without Pros and Cons 
(OSA or PMI is not needed) are based on assign-
ing EntityS1 as preferred for every sentence (tak-
ing the majority). Again, we can see that using 
external Pros and Cons (PCS(OSA)) helps dra-
matically. Not surprisingly, the improvements 
are statistically significant except the recall when 
EntityS1 is preferred.   
Table 3: Preferred entity identification with 187 
sentences that need context dependency handling 
 
 
EntityS1 Preferred EntityS2 Preferred
Prec. Rec. F Prec. Rec. F
PCS (OSA) 0.896 0.877 0.886 0.696 0.736 0.716
PCS: No Pros & 
Cons 0.722 1.000 0.839 0.000 0.000 0.000
PCS (PMI) 0.894 0.855 0.874 0.661 0.736 0.696
OSA vs. PMI: Comparing PCS(OSA) with PCS 
(PMI) (Table 3), OSA is better in F-score when 
EntityS1 is preferred by 1.2%, and better in F-
score when EntityS2 is preferred by 2%. Al-
though OSA?s improvements over PMI are not 
large, we believe that in principle OSA is a more 
suitable measure. Comparing with PMI when the 
whole dataset is used (Table 2), OSA?s gains are 
less because the number of sentences requiring 
context dependency handling is small (22%).  
6 Conclusions 
This paper studied sentiments expressed in com-
parative sentences. To our knowledge, no work 
has been reported on this topic. This paper pro-
posed an effective method to solve the problem, 
which also deals with context based sentiments 
by exploiting external information available on 
the Web. To use the external information, we 
needed a measure of association of the compara-
tive word and the entity feature. A new measure, 
called one-side association (OSA), was then pro-
posed. Experimental results show that the tech-
nique produces accurate results.
