Abstract
This paper presents the Chinese word seg-
mentation systems developed by Speech
and Hearing Research Group of Na-
tional Laboratory on Machine Perception
(NLMP) at Peking University, which were
evaluated in the third International Chi-
nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff held by
SIGHAN. The Chinese character-based
maximum entropy model, which switches
the word segmentation task to a classi-
fication task, is adopted in system de-
veloping. To integrate more linguistics
information, an n-gram language model
as well as several post processing strate-
gies are also employed. Both the closed
and open tracks regarding to all four cor-
pora MSRA, UPUC, CITYU, CKIP are
involved in our systems? evaluation, and
good performance are achieved. Espe-
cially, in the closed track on MSRA, our
system ranks 1st.
1 Introduction
Chinese word segmentation is one of the core tech-
niques in Chinese language processing and attracts
lots of research interests in recent years. Sev-
eral promising methods are proposed by previous
researchers, in which Maximum Entropy (ME)
model has turned out to be a successful way for
this task (Hwee Tou Ng et al, 2004; Jin Kiat
Low et al, 2005). By employing Maximum En-
tropy (ME) model, the Chinese word segmentation
task is regarded as a classification problem, where
each character will be classified to one of the four
classes, i.e., the beginning, middle, end of a multi-
character word and a single-character word.
However, in a high degree, ME model pays its
emphasis on Chinese characters while debases the
consideration on the relationship of the context
words. Motivated by this view, several strategies
used for reflecting the context words? relationship
and integrating more linguistics information, are
employed in our systems.
As known, an n-gram language model could ex-
press the relationship of the context words well, it
therefore as a desirable choice is imported in our
system to modify the scoring of the ME model.
An analysis on our preliminary experiments shows
the combination ambiguity is another issue that
should be specially tackled, and a division and
combination strategy is then adopted in our sys-
tem. To handle the numeral words, we also intro-
duce a number conjunction strategy. In addition,
to deal with the long organization names problem
in MSRA corpus, a post processing strategy for
organization name is presented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes our system in detail.
Section 3 presents the experiments and results.
And in last section, we draw our conclusions.
2 System Description
With the ME model, n-gram language model, and
several post processing strategies, our systems are
established. And detailed description on these
components are given in following subsections.
2.1 Maximum Entropy Model
The ME model used in our system is based on the
previous works (Jin Kiat Low et al, 2005; Hwee
Tou Ng et al, 2004). As mentioned above, the
ME model based word segmentation is a 4-classes
learning process. Here, we remarked four classes,
i.e. the beginning, middle, end of a multi-character
138
word and a single-character word, as b, m, e and s
respectively.
In ME model, the following features (Jin Kiat
Low et al, 2005) are selected:
a) cn (n = ?2,?1, 0, 1, 2)
b) cncn+1 (n = ?2,?1, 0, 1)
c) c?1c+1
where cn indicates the character in the left or right
position n relative to the current character c0.
For the open track especially, three extended
features are extracted with the help of an external
dictionary as follows:
d) Pu (c0)
e) L and t0
f) cnt0 (n = ?1, 0, 1)
where Pu(c0) denotes whether the current charac-
ter is a punctuation, L is the length of word W that
conjoined from the character and its context which
matching a word in the external dictionary as long
as possible. t0 is the boundary tag of the character
in W.
With the features, a ME model is trained which
could output four scores for each character with
regard to four classes. Based on scores of all char-
acters, a completely segmented semiangle matrix
can be constructed. Each element wji in this ma-
trix represents a word that starts at the ith charac-
ter and ends at jth character, and its value ME(j, i),
the score for these (j ? i+1) characters to form a
word, is calculated as follow:
ME[j, i] = ? log p(w = ci...cj)
= ? log[p(bci)p(mci+1)...
p(mcj?1)p(ecj )]
(1)
As a consequence, the optimal segmentation re-
sults corresponding to the best path with the low-
est overall score could be reached via a dynamic
programming algorithm. For example:
@?c????(I was 19 years old that year)
Table 1 shows its corresponding matrix. In this
example, the ultimate segmented result is:
@ ?c ? ???
2.2 Language Model
N-gram language model, a widely used method
in natural language processing, can represent the
context relation of words. In our systems, a bi-
gram model is integrated with ME model in the
phase of calculating the path score. In detail, the
score of a path will be modified by adding the bi-
gram of words with a weight ? at the word bound-
aries. The approach used for modifying path score
is based on the following formula.
V [j, i] = ME[j, i]
+mini?1k=1{[(V [i ? 1, k]
+?Bigram(wk,i?1, wi,j)}
(2)
where V[j,i] is the score of local best path which
ends at the jth character and the last word on the
path is wi,j = ci...cj , the parameter ? is optimized
by the test set used in the 2nd International Chi-
nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff. When scoring
the path, if one of the words wk,i?1 and wi,j is out
of the vocabulary, their bigram will backoff to the
unigram. And the unigram of the OOV word will
be calculated as:
Unigram(OOV Word) = pl (3)
where p is the minimal unigram value of words in
vocabulary; l is the length of the word acting as
a punishment factor to avoid overemphasizing the
long OOV words.
2.3 Post Processing Strategies
The analysis on preliminary experiments, where
the ME model and n-gram language model are in-
volved, lead to several post processing strategies
in developing our final systems.
2.3.1 Division and Combination Strategy
To handle the combination ambiguity issue,
we introduce a division and combination strategy
which take in use of unigram and bigram. For
each two words A and B, if their bigrams does
not exist while there exists the unigram of word
AB, then they can be conjoined as one word. For
example, ??ff(August)? and ???(revolution)?
are two segmented words, and in training set the
bigram of ??ff? and ???? is absent, while
the word ??ff??(the August Revolution)? ap-
peares, then the character string ??ff??? is
conjoined as one word. On the other hand, for a
word C which can be divided as AB, if its uni-
gram does not exit in training set, while the bigram
of its subwords A and B exits, then it will be re-
segmented. For example, Taking the word ??L
N?U?(economic system reform)? for instance,
if its corresponding unigram is absent in training
set, while the bigram of two subwords ??LN
139
@ ? c ? ? ? ?
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
@ 1 6.3180e-07
? 2 33.159 7.5801
c 3 26.401 0.0056708 5.2704
? 4 71.617 45.221 49.934 3.1001e-07
? 5 83.129 56.734 61.446 33.869 7.0559
? 6 90.021 63.625 68.337 40.760 12.525 12.534
? 7 77.497 51.101 55.813 28.236 0.0012012 10.077 10.055
Table 1: A completely segmented matrix
?(economic system)? and ?U?(reform)? exists,
as a consequence, it will be segmented into two
words ??LN?? and ?U??.
2.3.2 Numeral Word Processing Strategy
The ME model always segment a numeral
word into several words. For instance, the word
?4.34(RMB Yuan 4.34)?, may be segmented
into two words ?4.? and ?34?. To tackle this
problem, a numeral word processing strategy is
used. Under this strategy, those words that contain
Arabic numerals are manually marked in the train-
ing set firstly, then a list of high frequency charac-
ters which always appear alone between the num-
bers in the training set can be extracted, based on
which numeral word issue can be tackled as fol-
lows. When segmenting one sentence, if two con-
joint words are numeral words, and the last char-
acter of the former word is in the list, then they are
combined as one word.
2.3.3 Long Organization Name Processing
Strategy
Since an organization name is usually an OOV,
it always will be segmented as several words, es-
pecially for a long one, while in MSRA corpus, it
is required to be recognized as one word. In our
systems, a corresponding strategy is presented to
deal with this problem. Firstly a list of organiza-
tion names is manually selected from the training
set and stored in the prefix-tree based on charac-
ters. Then a list of prefixes is extracted by scan-
ning the prefix-tree, that is, for each node, if the
frequencies of its child nodes are all lower than the
predefined threshold k and half of the frequency of
the current node, the string of the current node will
be extracted as a prefix; otherwise, if there exists
a child node whose frequency is higher than the
threshold k, scan the corresponding subtree. In the
same way, the suffixes can also be extracted. The
only difference is that the order of characters is in-
verse in the lexical tree.
During recognizing phase, to a successive
words string that may include 2-5 words, will be
combined as one word, if all of the following con-
ditions are satisfied.
a) Does not include numbers, full stop or comma.
b) Includes some OOV words.
c) Has a tail substring matching some suffix.
d) Appears more than twice in the test data.
e) Has a higher frequency than any of its substring which
is an OOV word or combined by multiple words.
f) Satisfy the condition that for any two successive words
w1 w2 in the strings, freq(w1w2)/freq(w1)?0.1, unless w1
contains some prefix in its right.
3 Experiments and Results
We have participated in both the closed and open
tracks of all the four corpora. For MSRA corpus
and other three corpora, we build System I and
System II respectively. Both systems are based on
the ME model and the Maximum Entropy Toolkit
1, provided by Zhang Le, is adopted.
Four systems are derived from System I with re-
gard to whether or not the n-gram language model
and three post processing strategies are used on the
closed track of MSRA corpus. Table 2 shows the
results of four derived systems.

processing strategy. System ID adds the long or-
ganization name processing strategy.
For the open track of MSRA, an external dictio-
nary is utilized to extract the e and f features. The
external dictionary is built from six sources, in-
cluding the Chinese Concept Dictionary from In-
stitute of Computational Linguistics, Peking Uni-
versity(72,716 words), the LDC dictionary(43,120
words), the Noun Cyclopedia(111,633), the word
segmentation dictionary from Institute of Com-
puting Technology, Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences(84,763 words), the dictionary from Insti-
tute of Acoustics, and the dictionary from Insti-
tute of Computational Linguistics, Peking Univer-
sity(68,200 words) and a dictionary collected by
ourselves(63,470 words).
The union of the six dictionaries forms a big
dictionary, and those words appearing in five or
six dictionaries are extracted to form a core dic-
tionary. If a word belongs to one of the following
dictionaries or word sets, it is added into the exter-
nal dictionary.
a) The core dictionary.
b) The intersection of the big dictionary and the training
data.
c) The words appearing in the training data twice or more
times.
Those words in the external dictionaries will be
eliminated, if in most cases they are divided in
the training data. Table 3 shows the effect of ME
model, n-gram language model, three post pro-
cessing strategies on the open track of MSRA.
Here System IO only adopts the basic features,
while the external dictionary based features are
used in four derived systems related to open track:
IA, IB, IC, ID.

System II only adopts ME model, the division
and combination strategy and the numeral word
processing strategy. In the open track of the cor-
pora CKIP and CITYU, the training set and test set
from the 2nd Chinese Word Segmentation Backoff
are used for training. For the corpora UPUC and
CITYU, the external dictionaries are used, which
is constructed in the same way as that in the open
track of MSRA Corpus. Table 4 shows the official
results of system II on UPUC, CKIP and CITYU.

Table 4: Official results of our systems on UPUC
CKIP and CITYU
On the UPUC corpus, an interesting observation
is that the performance of the open track is worse
than the closed track. The investigation and analy-
sis lead to a possible explanation. That is, the seg-
mentation standard of the dictionaries, which are
used to construct the external dictionary, is differ-
ent from that of the UPUC corpus.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, a detailed description on several Chi-
nese word segmentation systems are presented,
where ME model, n-gram language model as well
as three post processing strategies are involved. In
the closed track of MSRA, the integration of bi-
gram language model greatly improves the recall
ratio of the words in vocabulary, although it will
impairs the performance of system in recognizing
the words out of vocabulary. In addition, three
strategies are introduced to deal with combination
ambiguity, numeral word, long organization name
issues. And the evaluation results reveal the valid-
ity and effectivity of our approaches.
