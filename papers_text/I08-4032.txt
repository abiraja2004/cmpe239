Abstract 
This paper introduces the system of Word 
Segmentation and analyzes its evaluation 
results in the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff1 . A 
novel method has been used in the system, 
which main idea is: firstly, the main 
problems of WS have been classified, and 
then a cascaded model has been used to 
gradually optimize the system.  The core of 
this WS system is the segmentation of 
ambiguous words and the internal 
information extraction of unknown words. 
The experiments show that the performance 
is satisfying, with the RIV-measure 96.8% 
in NCC open test in the SIGHAN bakeoff 
2007.  
1  Introduction 
Chinese Word Segmentation is a fundamental task 
for some Chinese NLP tasks, such as ma chine 
translation, speech recognition and information 
retrieval etc. However, the current performance of 
WS is not satisfying. In WS the disambiguation 
processing and unknown words recognition are the

Science Foundation of China No. 60473139, the National 
Natural Science Foundation of China No. 60775041and the

two difficult problems. So, we aim at the solution 
of the both problem in our WS system. We 
participated the SIGHAN bakeoff 2007 evaluation, 
and a cascade model has been used in the process 
of word segmentation. In the WS system, the core 
modules are the segmentation of ambiguous words 
and the extraction of internal information of 
unknown words. 
2 System Description Introduction 
Figure1 shows the workflow of our WS system. 
The system is made up of the following modules: 
small sentences segmentation, disambiguation, and 
unknown words recognition.

In fact, ambiguities may appear between two 
lexical words or between a lexical word and an 
unknown word. Based on the observation, the 
disambiguation processing is prior to the unknown 
word recognition in the system. 
2.1 Disambiguation 
We classify the ambiguities into two categories: one 
is true-ambiguity, the other is pseudo-ambiguity. 
And the process of the true-ambiguity is the 
disambiguation emphasis. 
According to the NCC training corpus, we build 
pseudo-ambiguity database. For pseudo-ambiguity, 
disambiguation can be realized through matching 
against the database. 
We get al ambiguities from the training corpus. 
Pseudo-ambiguity can be solved by finding the 
database of pseudo-ambiguities which built on the 
base of the analyses of NCC corpus.  
For true-ambiguities, we also build a database and 
use a statistical model to disambiguate.  
Based on the examination of the database of 
ambiguities, we find that true-ambiguities appear in 
the two cases: ( ?1 both frequencies of two 
segmentations of ambiguities are low, or the gap 
between the two frequencies is too large; (2) both 
frequencies of two segmentations of ambiguities are 
high. For the former case, the segmentation form 
corresponding to the lower frequency is saved in the 
database. For the latter case, both segmentations and 
their context are saved in the database. And the 
system will choose the appropriate segmentation 
according to the statistic model.  
The statistic model can be represented as the 
following formulas: 
)|(maxarg xypy
y
=  
3
0
( | ) ( , ) ( , )ij
i j
p y x bi f x y p x y
=
=? ?  
,
( , )
( , )
( , )
x X y Y
freq x y
p x y
freq x y
? ?
= ?  
Among the formulas, x is the context, and y is 
the segmentation form, fi(x,y) is the feature 
functions, p(x,y) is the empirical probability, and bi 
is the impact factor of the feature function, whose 
value is determined according to the Tongyici 
Cilin 2 . Here, (x,y) can considers not only the 
                                                          
2 HIT IR-Lab Tongyici Cilin (Extended) 
neighboring words but also the semantic 
information of the neighboring words. 
The impact factor bi is defined as follows: 
Let ( ), ( )p pre S t next S? ? , so 
 
 
Where pre(S) is the set of the ambiguity S?s 
environment which is consist of former word; 
next(S) is the set of the ambiguity S?s environment 
which is consist of latter word; p is the former 
word of the current ambiguity, n is the latter word 
of the current ambiguity. 
In the model the synonym is defined as: 
Let s1 and s2 are both words. If the first three 
bits of s1?s code in Tongyici Cilin are same with 
the first three bits of s2?s code in Tongyici Cilin, s1 
is the synonym of s2, or s2 is the synonym of s1. 
2.2 Unknown Words Recognition  
In the process of unknown words recognition, we 
consider not only the inner information of unknown 
words, but also the environment of unknown words. 
(1) Related definition (productivity): Productivity 
is the weight which measures the single character?s 
location in the whole word.  
If Ai is a single character, ti is the tag of Ai?s 
location, let ti {B? , M, S}, PAi(ti) is the productivity 
of the single character Ai in the location ti, which 
we can write as follows: 
( , )
( )
( , )i
i
i i
A i
i it T
count A t
P t
count A t?
= ?
 
(2)The inner information of unknown words 
mainly refer to the frequent of each character as 
word?s begin, middle and end, as show in Table 1. 
Word Tag Freq 
A1 B/M/E 447/26/3 
A2 B/M/E 2/0/0 
A3 B/M/E 979/76/206 
??? ??? ??? 
Table1 inner information of unknown words3
                                                          
3 A1, A2, A3 represent the single character of Chinese. B, M, 
E represent respectively current character as the word?s head, 
middle and end.

In the process of abstracting the exterior 
information, we have analyzed the tagged corpus 
and found that feature words have an important 
effect on the unknown words recognition, such as: 
predicate, post, specific behavior verb, etc. 
For example: 
Post: chairman, prime minister, etc. 
Job?reporter, singer, writer, etc. 
Appellation?comrade, sir, miss, etc. 
Specific behavior verb? say, think, nominate, 
investigate, etc. 
The process of unknown words recognition:   
?A1 A2 A3A4 A5A6?..? is the disambiguation 
results, if single character of A2 has PA2(B)>0.35 
and PA2(M) >0.35 or PA2(E) >0.35, A1 A2 have the 
possibility to be an unknown words. After that, we 
filter it using the exterior information in order to 
improve Roov. 
3 Performance and analysis  
The performance of our system in the SIGHAN 
bakeoff 2007 is presented in table 2. 
OPEN R P F POOV RIV
NCC 94.5 92.6 93.5 71.6 96.9
Table 2 NCC test in SIGHAN bakeoff 2007 (%) 
Our system has better performance in terms of 
Riv measure which attributed to the module of 
disambiguation. However, because the unsuitable 
threshold choice leads lots words combined 
incorrectly, the Roov measure is lower. 
4 Conclusions  
In this paper we use a cascade model to finish WS 
task and the system achieves a good performance 
on Riv measure. It indicates that this method is 
feasible and effective. However, the shortcoming of 
the system is that the method of unknown words 
recognition hasn?t got ideal performance which will 
be our future research focus.
