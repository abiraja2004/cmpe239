Abstract
In this paper we report on our recent efforts to
collect a corpus of spoken lecture material that
will enable research directed towards fast, ac-
curate, and easy access to lecture content. Thus
far, we have collected a corpus of 270 hours of
speech from a variety of undergraduate courses
and seminars. We report on an initial analysis
of the spontaneous speech phenomena present
in these data and the vocabulary usage patterns
across three courses. Finally, we examine lan-
guage model perplexities trained from written
and spoken materials, and describe an initial
recognition experiment on one course.
1 Introduction
In the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase
in the availability of on-line academic lecture material.
These educational resources can potentially change the
way people learn ? students with disabilities can en-
hance their educational experience, professionals can
keep up with recent advancements in their field, and peo-
ple of all ages can satisfy their thirst for knowledge. In
contrast to many other communicative activities however,
lecture processing has until recently enjoyed little bene-
fit from the development of human language technology.
Although there has been significant research directed to-
ward audio indexing and retrieval (Bacchiani et al, 2001;
Foote, 1999; Jourlin et al, 2000; Makhoul et al, 2000;
Franz et al, 2003; Renals et al, 2000), lecture tran-
scription and analysis is a relatively unexplored area in
speech and natural language research. The most substan-
tial research on lectures has been performed as part of
the Spontaneous Speech Project in Japan (Furui, 2003),
where researchers are processing a variety of Japanese
monologues such as academic and simulated presenta-
tions, news commentaries, etc. There has also been some
work reported on German lectures (Hurst et al, 2002).
One of the reasons for the minimal research in this
area is due to the limited availability of relevant data.
The only publicly available corpus of academic presen-
tations in English is TED, which includes 48 hours of au-
dio recordings of 188 presentations given at Eurospeech
?93 (Lamel et al, 1994). Only 6 of the presenters were
native English speakers however, and only 39 of the lec-
tures have been transcribed. The Corpus of Spontaneous
Japanese currently contains over 2,500 transcribed pre-
sentations (Kawahara et al, 2003). Both of these corpora
focus on conference presentations, which are shorter and
have a lower degree of spontaneity than a one hour or 90
minute classroom lecture.
We have recently initiated a research effort with the
goal of enabling fast, accurate, and easy access to lec-
ture materials. As part of the first phase of this research,
we have begun to create a large corpus of spoken lecture
material. In this paper, we document our ongoing data
collection activities, and describe the results of our pre-
liminary analyses of these data.
2 Corpus Creation and Annotation
In our efforts to date, we have created an initial corpus
of approximately 270 hours containing lectures from six
different courses, and from over 80 seminars given on a
variety of topics. On average, each course contained over
30 lecture sessions. These data were recorded with an
omni-directional microphone (as part of a video record-
ing), and generally occurred in a classroom environment.
To provide data for acoustic and language model train-
ing, we are in the process of generating transcriptions for
the lecture material we have collected to date. An ini-
tial set of transcriptions have been generated by an au-
dio transcription service. The transcription service was
instructed to pay careful attention to generating a correct
literal transcription of what was spoken (and not a ?clean?
transcript with disfluencies such as filled pauses and false
starts removed). In additional to the spoken words, the
transcription service also provided the following anno-
tations: (1) occasional time markers, usually at obvious
pauses or sentence boundaries, (2) locations of speaker
changes (labeled with speaker identities when known),
and (3) punctuation based on the transcribers subjective
assessment of the structure of the spoken utterances.
In addition to the audio data, we have obtained elec-
tronic versions of texts associated with three of these
courses, and over 100 summaries of lecture content for
one of them. We have also obtained electronic notes and
presentations for another course. These resources will be
used for our research involving written and spoken data.
3 Analysis of Lecture Characteristics
3.1 Qualitative Analysis
As illustrated in Figure 1, lecture data has much in com-
mon with casual, or spontaneous speech data, including
false starts, extraneous filler words ( such as ?okay? and
?well?), and non-lexical filled pauses (such as ?uh? or
?um?). One can also easily observe that the colloquial
nature of the data is dramatically different in style from
the same presentation of this material in a text book. For
example, one linear algebra text book covers this material
using a section header that reads, ?8 Rules of Matrix Mul-
tiplication,? followed by text that reads, ?The method for
multiplying two matrices A and B to get C = AB can be
summarized as follows...? The section header and intro-
ductory sentence express the same information as the ten
utterances spoken in Figure 1. In other words, the textual
format is typically more concise and better organized.
Apart from poor planning at the sentence level, lecture
speech often exhibits poor planning at higher structural
levels as well. For example, tangential threads digressing
from the current primary theme are common in sponta-
neous speech. This is exemplified by the brief diversion
into matrix inversion in utterances (4), (5) and (6). This
off-theme digression occurs only three utterances after
the primary theme of ?the rules for matrix multiplication?
is introduced in (1).
3.2 Quantitative Analysis
In order to better quantify the characteristics of lecture
data, we have recently examined a set of 80 lectures taken
from three undergraduate courses in math, physics, and
computer science. The total number of words in each
approximately one hour lecture ranged between 5K and
12K words, with an average of nearly 7K words, and
standard deviation of 1.5K words. The number of unique
words used per lecture ranged from 500 to 1,100 words,
with an average of 800 words, and standard deviation
of 170 words. A preliminary assessment of spontaneous
speech phenomena showed that there tended to be fewer

do it, and they all give the same answer.

trices.

tiplying a matrix B and ? giving me a result ? well, I
could call it C.

filled pauses than in Switchboard (1% vs. 3%), although
there were similar amounts of partial words (1%) and
contractions (3-4% vs. 5%) in the data we observed. It
is also clear that the behavior will very much depend on
the lecturer. However, on the basis of these results, we
hypothesize that in terms of spontaneous speech phenom-
ena, the lecture data is closer to Switchboard quality than
it is to a more carefully spoken corpus such as Broadcast
News.
As a preliminary examination of vocabulary usage, we
measured the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of the lec-
ture material as a function of vocabulary size, where the
words in the vocabulary were the most frequently oc-
curring words for a given set of training data. Figure 2
displays the OOV rate vs. vocabulary size for a variety
of speech and text training sources on the latter half of
the computer science lectures (? 10hrs of speech). Each
curve plots the OOV rate as a function of the most fre-
quent words from a particular set of training material.
Curves (A), and (B) show the results using the 64K-word
Broadcast News, and 27K Switchboard lexicons, respec-
tively. Curve (C) was computed from the combined lec-
tures from a math and physics course. The remaining
curves were all computed from subject-specific material.
Curve (D) was computed from a companion textbook,
while curve (E) was computed from the first half of the
computer science lectures. Curve (F) was computed from
a combination of the text and lecture transcripts from the
course (i.e., (D)+(E)).
If one considers the best vocabulary to be one that has
a small OOV rate and a small size, the best matching data

was obtained, not surprisingly, from subject-specific ma-
terial. Even material from non-subject-related lectures
match the test data better than data from general human-
human conversations or broadcast news. However, we
have also observed (not plotted) that a combination of
general lecture and conversational material, combined
with related text material, can produce behavior similar
to subject-specific speech material.
In order to examine the impact of language model
training data on predicting word usage in lecture material,
we created a 3.3K-word vocabulary exactly covering the
latter half of the computer science lectures. We then cre-
ated trigram language models from a variety of sources
(ignoring OOV words) using the SRILM Toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002), and measured their perplexity on this data.
The results, as shown in Table 1, show again, not surpris-
ingly, that spoken material provides the most constraints.
Text material from Broadcast News or even the course
textbook are poor predictors of language usage. Models
of general human conversations do significantly better,
although data from general lectures is better than arbi-
trary conversations. It was interesting to observe that a
mixture of subject-specific textbook material and exam-
ple lectures provided the most constraints for new lec-
ture material, although there is still a considerable gap
between this and the case of training the language model
on the test set.
Finally, to investigate the nature of the OOV words for
a general vocabulary, we created a vocabulary of 1,568
words that were common to all three courses. Table 2

lists the ten most frequent subject-specific words for each
of the three courses (i.e., OOV words that were not in
the common vocabulary), along with the rank of each
of these words in the Broadcast News and Switchboard
corpora. Not surprisingly, these OOV words tend to be
subject-specific content words, and are likely to be im-
portant words for any kind of summarization or retrieval
task.
4 Preliminary Transcript Generation
The speech recognition processing that has been used to
generate transcripts of spoken lectures has largely been
based on large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition
technology (Hurst et al, 2002; Leeuwis et al, 2003;
Kawahara et al, 2003; Yokoyama et al, 2003). Lan-
guage modeling research has focused on mixing topic-
dependent textual source material (e.g., conference pa-
pers) with unrelated or topic-independent spoken mate-
rial (e.g., Switchboard data, or transcripts of other spoken
material) (Kato et al, 2000).
In our initial speech recognition experiments, we have
developed a recognizer that has been used to align the
transcripts with the speech signal for three courses (ap-
proximately 80 lectures) (Glass, 2003). Based on man-
ual examination, we believe that the alignments of the
16KHz wide-band speech are of good quality, and are
on par with previous alignments we have performed on
Broadcast News, Switchboard, as well as our own in-
ternal spontaneous speech corpora. Using these data as
training material, we have performed a baseline speech
recognition experiment on one course. Using a 5000
word vocabulary and trigram language model (perplex-
ity 120) derived from a portion of lecture transcriptions
and text book, we obtained a 33% word error rate on un-
seen lectures. This result is in line with other lecture word
error rates of 30-40% that have been reported in the liter-
ature (Leeuwis et al, 2003; Kawahara et al, 2003).

5 Ongoing and Future Activities
The technical language of academic lectures and lack of
in-domain spoken data for training makes lecture tran-
scription a significant challenge, that will require new
methods for deriving a vocabulary and language model.
To enable effective use of comparable textual material as
a surrogate for in-domain spoken data, we plan to inves-
tigate techniques to transform written text into a conver-
sation style that can be used for language modelling. We
are also exploring a lecture-independent recognizer struc-
ture that uses a small number of words common to lec-
ture discourse along with a sub-word model to represent
subject-specific words.
Finally, we plan to continue to collect and compile
lecture material into a comprehensive annotated corpus.
It is our plan to make this resource available to the
research community, in the hope that it will facilitate
speech and language processing research in this area.
