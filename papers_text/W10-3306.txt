Abstract
We propose a novel algorithm to ex-
tract taxonomic (or isa/instanceOf ) rela-
tions from category structure by classi-
fying each category link. Previous algo-
rithms mainly focus on lexical patterns of
category names to classify whether or not
a given category link is an isa/instanceOf.
In contrast, our algorithm extracts intrin-
sic properties that represent the definition
of given category name, and uses those
properties to classify each category link.
Experimental result shows about 5 to 18 %
increase in F-Measure, compared to other
existing systems.
1 Introduction
1.1 Problem Description
Taxonomies are a crucial component of many ap-
plications, including document clustering (Hotho
et al, 2003) and database search (Byron et al,
1997). Due to their importance, many studies
have examined methods of extracting taxonomic
relations automatically - either from unstructured
text (Cimiano et al, 2005; Cimiano(2) et al,
2005), or from structured data such as Wikipedia
category structures (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007;
Nastase and Strube, 2008; Suchanek et al, 2007).
Many researchers have attempted to obtain tax-
onomic relations from unstructured text to con-
stuct a taxonomy, but in most cases such a system
shows poor precision and low recall. Approaches
to extracting taxonomic relations from structured
data show relatively high performance, but to ob-
tain a taxonomy these require huge amounts of
structured data. Recently, as large amounts of
structured data such as the infoboxes and category
structures of Wikipedia or DBpedia (Auer et al,
2007) have become available, an obstacle to this
approach has been removed.
Although a category structure does contain
some kind of hierarchical structure, in many cases
it cannot be considered as an isa/instanceOf hier-
archy. For example, the article ?Pioneer 111? on
Wikipedia is categorized under ?Radio frequency
propagation?, which is related to the ?Pioneer 11?
but is obviously not a taxonomical parent of ?Pio-
neer 11?.
In this paper, we propose a method for extract-
ing taxonomic relations from a given category
structure. More precisely, for a category link in
the given category structure, the algorithm deter-
mines whether the link could be considered an
isa/instanceOf relation, or if the link simply rep-
resents a broader term/narrower term/related term
relation. For a given category link <A, B>, in
which A is the upper category name and B is the
lower category/article name, we attempt to get the
definition of B to classify the link. More precisely,
we analyze the upper categories of B from the
given category structure, to get tokens that rep-
resents the definition of B. Once we get the to-
kens, we compare the tokens with the name of A,
to classify the given category link. We call the
tokens that represent the definition of B ?intrin-
sic tokens? of B; a more precise definition will be
presented in section 3.1.
To show the validity of this approach, the algo-
rithm is applied to Wikipedia?s category structure,
1Pioneer 11 was the probe for second mission of the Pio-
neer program (after its sister probe Pioneer 10) to investigate
Jupiter and the outer solar system.

to obtain taxonomic relations there. Wikipedia?s
category structure consists of categories, article
titles and links between them. A Wikipedia arti-
cle represents one document, and a category is the
grouping of those articles by non-categorization-
expert users. Each category has its own name,
which is assigned by these users.
Although Wikipedia?s category structure is
built by non-experts, it can be thought of as reli-
able since it is refined by many people, and it con-
tains 35,904,116 category links between 764,581
categories and 6,301,594 articles, making it a per-
fect target for an experimental taxonomic relation
extraction algorithm.
After describing related works in section 2, our
detailed algorithm is proposed in section 3, and its
experimental results are discussed in section 4. In
section 5, we make some conclusions and propos-
als for future work.
2 Related Works
Methods of taxonomic relation extraction can be
divided into two broad categories depending on
the input: unstructured or structured data. The ex-
traction of taxonomic relations from unstructured
text is mainly carried out using lexical patterns on
the text. The Hearst pattern (Hearst, 1992) is used
in many pattern-based approaches, such as Cimi-
ano (2005).
In addition, there has been research that at-
tempted to use existing structured data, like the
Wikipedia category structure or the contents of a
thesaurus. The system of Ponzetto (2007) deter-
mines whether or not the given Wikipedia cate-
gory link is an isa/instanceOf relation by applying
a set of rules to the category names, while Nas-
tase (2008) defined lexical patterns on category
names, in addition to Ponzetto (2007). The YAGO
system (Suchanek et al, 2007) attempts to classify
whether the given article-category link represents
an instanceOf relation by checking the plurality
of the upper category name.
The algorithm proposed in this paper focuses
on the structured data, mainly the category struc-
ture, to gather isa/instanceOf relations. The
system gets a category structure as input, and
classifies each category link inside the category
structure according to whether it represents an
isa/instanceOf relation or not.
3 Algorithm Description
In section 3.1, we introduce the necessary defini-
tions for isa/instanceOf relations and the required
terms to describe the algorithm. In section 3.2,
we will discuss the hypotheses based on the defi-
nitions described in section 3.1. Next, two binary
classification algorithms will be proposed based
on the hypotheses, which will determine whether
the given category link is an isa/instanceOf rela-
tion or not.
3.1 Definitions
To define isa and instanceOf relations, Mi-
zoguchi (2004) introduces the concept of intrin-
sic property and other related concepts, which are
shown in the following definitions 1, 2 and 3:
Definition 1: Intrinsic property. The intrinsic
property of a thing is a property which is essen-
tial to the thing and it loses its identity when the
property changes.
Definition 2: The ontological definition of a
class. A thing which is a conceptualization of a set
X can be a class if and only if each element x of X
belongs to the class X if and only if the intrinsic
property of x satisfies the intensional condition of
X. And, then and only then, <x instanceOf X>
holds.
Definition 3: isa relation. isa relation holds
only between classes. <class A isa class B>
holds iff the instance set of A is a subset of the
instance set of B.
In addition, we define the following terms for
algorithm description:
Definition 4: intrinsic token. Token 2 T is an
intrinsic token of B iff T represents the intrinsic
property of B.
For example, when B is ?Pioneer 11?, the in-
trinsic tokens of B are ?spacecraft?, ?escape3?,
?Jupiter?, etc.
2For example, token is a segmented term in category
names of Wikipedia category structure.
3Since the main purpose of Pioneer 11 is to escape from
the solar system and fly into the deep space, we thought ?es-
cape? is the intrinsic token of ?Pioneer 11?. In the same con-
text, ?spacecraft escaping the solar system? is a taxonomical
parent of ?Pioneer 11?.
49
Definition 5: category link. <A, B> is called
category link iff A is a category of B, and that fact
is explicitly stated in the given category structure.
Consider the example of Wikipedia. If B is
an article, <A, B> is called an article-category
link, and if B is a category, <A, B> is called a
category-category link. The article is a catego-
rized terminal object.
Definition 6: category structure. Category
structure is the collection of category links, its
component categories, and categorized terminal
objects.
Definition 7: upper category set. The upper
category set of B is defined as the set of upper
categories of B up to n step in the given category
structure, and it is expressed as U(B, n).
For example, if the two category links <Jupiter
spacecraft, Pioneer 11> and <Jupiter, Jupiter
spacecraft> exist inside the given category struc-
ture, then Jupiter spacecraft is the element of
U(Pioneer 11, 1), while Jupiter is not.
Figure 1 shows the category structure of
U(Pioneer 11, 3),which we refer to throughout
this paper to explain our algorithm.
3.2 Hypotheses
According to the classical Aristotelian view, cat-
egories are discrete entities characterized by a set
of properties shared by their members. Thus, we
make the following lemmas:
Lemma 1: If some objects are grouped into the
same category, then they share at least more than
one property.
According to definition 2, if x is an instanceOf
X, then the intrinsic property of x satisfies the def-
inition of X. Since the intrinsic property is the
property related to the definition of the object, we
can assume that in most categorization systems,
the intrinsic property is the most frequently shared
property among those objects categorized in the
same category.
Lemma 2. Intrinsic properties are shared most
frequently among objects in a category.
Lemma 2 means that, for example, the intrin-
sic token T of B will show up frequently among
the names of upper categories of B. But lemma
2 does NOT mean that non-intrinsic tokens will
not frequently appear among the upper category
names. For example, the elements of U(Pioneer
11, 3) from the Wikipedia category structure con-
tain the token ?spacecraft? 4 times, but it also
contain token ?technology? 3 times. Therefore,
we cannot directly use the token frequency to de-
termine which one is the intrinsic token: rather,
we make another assumption to get the ?intrinsic
score? for each token.
Lemma 3. Intrinsic tokens co-occur frequently
with other intrinsic tokens.
Lemma 3 means that, if T1 is an intrinsic to-
ken of B, and T2 co-occurs with T1 inside the
upper category names of B, then there is a high
probability that T2 is also an intrinsic token of B.
For example, for the category link<Jupiter space-
craft, Pioneer 11>, if the token ?spacecraft? is an
intrinsic token of ?Pioneer 11?, we can assume
that the token ?Jupiter? is also an intrinsic token
of ?Pioneer 11?. Since some intrinsic tokens that
are appropriate as modifiers are not appropriate as
head words ? for example, if the token ?Jupiter?
is used as a modifier, it will be a good intrinsic
token of ?Pioneer 11?, but if it is used as a head
word, choosing it as the intrinsic token of ?Pio-
neer 11? would be bad choice ? thus, we distin-
guish between intrinsic score as head word, and
intrinsic score as modifier. If the intrinsic score
of token T is high for article/category name B,
then it means the probability is high that T is an
intrinsic token of B. We assumed that only the
co-occurrences as head word and its modifier are
meaningful. Corollary 3-1. If a modifier co-
occurs with a head word, and the head word is
frequently an intrinsic token of an object, then the
modifier is an intrinsic token of the object.
Corollary 3-2. If a head word co-occurs with a
modifier, and the modifier is frequently an intrin-
sic token of an object, then the head word is an
intrinsic token of the object.
3.3 Proposed Algorithm
Based on the hypotheses proposed in section 3.2,
we propose two algorithms to get the intrinsic
score of each token in the following sections. The
first algorithm, a counting-based approach, uses
only lemmas 1 and 2, and it will be shown why
this algorithm will not work. The second algo-
rithm, a graph-based approach, uses all of the hy-
50
Figure 1: category structure of U(Pioneer 11, 3) from Wikipedia.
potheses to solve the problem.
For the given category link <A, B>, the intrin-
sic score of each token will be calculated based
on its frequency inside U(B, n) while separately
counting the token?s intrinsic score as modifiers
and the intrinsic score as head word. We here
propose a scoring mechanism based on the HITS
page ranking algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999): For the
given category link <A, B>, we first construct a
?modifier graph? using U(B, n), and then calcu-
late the intrinsic score for each token in U(B, n)
using the HITS algorithm. After that, the intrinsic
score of each token will be used to calculate the
score of <A, B>. If the score is higher than some
predefined threshold, then<A, B> is classified as
an isa/instanceOf link, and otherwise it is not.
3.3.1 Counting-based Approach
This method utilizes lemmas 1 and 2 to get the
intrinsic score for each token, and then uses the
score to determine whether the given category link
is an isa/instanceOf link or not.
To utilize this approach, we first score each to-
ken from U(B, n) by counting the frequency of
each token from the words of U(B, n). Table 1
shows the score of each token from U(Pioneer, 3)
for figure 1.
For the ?Pioneer 11? article, there are seven
category links in Wikipedia?s category struc-
ture: <1973 in space exploration, Pioneer 11>,
<Inactive extraterrestrial probes, Pioneer 11>,
<Jupiter spacecraft, Pioneer 11>, <Pioneer pro-

gram, Pioneer 11>, <Radio frequency propaga-
tion, Pioneer 11>, <Saturn spacecraft, Pioneer
11>, and <Spacecraft escaping the Solar System,
Pioneer 11>, as shown in figure 1. The scores
of each link using a counting-based approach are
acquired by adding the scores for each token in ta-
ble 1 that is matched with single term occurrence
in category names. Table 2 shows the result of
counting-based approach.
Although the link <1973 in space exploration,
Pioneer 11> receives the highest score among
those seven links, obviously the link does not rep-
resent isa/instanceOf relation. This shows that
the counting approach does not guarantee accu-
racy. Table 1 shows that non-intrinsic tokens oc-
cur frequently (such as ?technology? in this exam-

ple). We call this an ?overloaded existence? error.
To solve the problems described above, we apply
Lemma 3, Corollary 3-1 and 3-2 to our calcula-
tion, and propose a second algorithm based on a
graph-based approach, which will be explained in
the next section.
3.3.2 Graph-based Approach
In this section, we propose a graph-based ap-
proach to get the intrinsic score of each token. To
do this, we first construct a modifier graph from
the words of U(B, n) for a given category link<A,
B>, with each node representing a token from the
elements of U(B, n), and each edge representing
the co-occurrence of tokens inside each element
of U(B, n). Next, we apply a well-known graph
analysis algorithm to that graph, and get the in-
trinsic scores for each node. Finally, we use the
score of each node to get the score of the given
category link.
Constructing modifier graph Modifier graph
constructed here is defined as a directed graph,
in which each node represents each token inside
U(B, n), and each edge represents a co-occurrence
as modifier-head relation inside each category
name of U(B, n). Using the subset of U(Pioneer
11, 3), we get the modifier graph of figure 2.4
Figure 2: Modifier graph of the subset of
U(Pioneer 11, 3): {Spacecraft escaping the Solar
System, Jupiter spacecraft, 1973 in space explo-
ration, NASA probes, Saturn}
Calculating Intrinsic score After constructing
the modifier graph, we apply the HITS algorithm
to the modifier graph. Since the HITS algorithm
cannot reflect the weight of edges, a modified ver-
sion of the HITS algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2005) is adopted:
Authority(Vi) =
?
Vj?In(Vi)
eji ? Hub(Vj) (1)
Hub(Vi) =
?
Vj?Out(Vi)
eij ? Authority(Vj) (2)
In(Vi) represents the set of vertices which has
the outgoing edge to Vi, Out(Vi) represents the
set of vertices which has the incoming edge from
Vi, and eij represents the weight of the edge from
Vi to Vj . The algorithm for calculating the scores
is as follows:
1. Initialize the authority and hub score of each
node to one.
2. Calculate hub score of each node using the
formula 2.
3. Calculate authority score of each node using
the formula 1.
4. Normalize authority & hub score so that the
sum of authority score of every node and the sum
of hub score of every node are one.
4We used the full set of U(B, n) to create the modifier
graph for the full scale of experimentation in section 4.
52
5. Iterate from step 2 until the score of every
node converges.
In the modifier graph, Authority score can be
mapped to the intrinsic score of a node(token) as
a head word, and Hub score can be mapped to the
intrinsic score of a node(token) as a modifier.
Scoring Category Link Now, we can score the
input category link. The score of category link
<A, B> is given as follows:
Score(< A,B >)
= Authority(h) +
?
a in mod(A)
Hub(a) (3)
Here, Score(< A,B >) represents the final
score of category link <A, B>, h represents the
head word of A, and mod(A) represents the set
of modifiers of A. Since the score of head word
and modifiers are calculated based on the upper
categories of B, this formula can integrate both
meaning of A and B to classify whether the link is
isa/instanceOf. Table 3 shows the scores of seven
article-category links from table 2, calculated us-
ing the graph-based approach.
Article-Category Links Score
<Spacecraft escaping the Solar
System, Pioneer 11>
0.5972
<1973 in space exploration, Pio-
neer 11>
0.4018
<Jupiter spacecraft, Pioneer 11> 0.2105
<Saturn spacecraft, Pioneer 11> 0.2105
<Inactive extraterrestrial probes,
Pioneer 11>,
0.0440
<Radio frequency propagation, Pi-
oneer 11>
0.0440
<Pioneer program, Pioneer 11> 0.0132
Table 3: Scoring each category links using graph-
based approach
The link <Spacecraft escaping the Solar Sys-
tem, Pioneer 11> gets the highest score, while
the link <1973 in space exploration, Pioneer
11>, which got the highest score using counting-
based approach, gets the second place. That
proves the algorithm?s effectiveness for distin-
guishing isa/instanceOf link from other non-
isa/instanceOf links. But there is still a problem -
although the first-ranked link is a isa/instanceOf
link, the second-ranked is not, while the third
and fourth-ranked links (<Jupiter spacecraft, Pi-
oneer 11>, <Saturn spacecraft, Pioneer 11> are
isa/instanceOf links. To get a better result, we
propose four additional modifications in the next
secton.
3.4 Additional Modifications to the
Graph-based Approach
To better reflect the category structure and the
property of category names to the scoring mech-
anism, the following four modifications can be
made. Each of these modification could be ap-
plied independently to the original algorithm de-
scribed in section 3.3.2.
Authority Impact Factor (I). In most cases,
a category name contains only one head word,
while it contains 2 or more modifiers. As Formula
(3) is just the linear sum of the hub scores of each
modifier and the authority score of the head word,
the resultant score is more affected by hub score,
because the number of modifiers is normally big-
ger than the number of head words. To balance
the effect of hub score and authority score, we in-
troduce authority impact factor I:
Score(< A,B >)
= I ? Authority(h) +
?
a in mod(A)
Hub(a) (4)
The authority impact factor is defined as the aver-
age number of modifiers in the elements of U(B,
n), since normally each category name contains
only one head word.
Dummy Node (D). There are some category
names that contain only one head word and no
modifier, thus making it impossible to create the
modifier graph.5 Thus, for such category names
we introduce dummy nodes to include their infor-
mation into the modifier graph. In figure 3, you
can observe the introduction of the dummy node
?dummy0?.
5For example, in figure 2, we cannot find node ?Saturn?
while U(Pioneer 11, 3) contains category name ?Saturn?
53
Figure 3: Modifier graph of the subset of
U(Pioneer 11, 3), with dummy node.
Category Distance Factor (C). We define the
category distance between category/article A and
B as the minimum number of category links re-
quired to reach B from A by following the cate-
gory links. Category distance factor C of a cat-
egory name A from U(B, n) is the reverse of the
category distance between A and B. We assumed
that, if the distance between A and B is higher,
then it is less probable for A to have the intrinsic
property of B. Based on this assumption, category
distance factor C of category name A is multiplied
by the edge score of an edge generated by cate-
gory name A.
Figure 4 shows the modifier graph of figure 2
that applies the category distance factor. Since
the category distance between ?Pioneer 11? and
?NASA probe? is two, the score of edge (NASA,
probe) is 1/2 = 0.5.
Figure 4: Modifier graph of the subset of
U(Pioneer 11, 3), with category distance factor.
Modifier Number Normalization Factor (W).
In the algorithm of building a modifier graph, the
head word of a category name with many mod-
ifiers has the advantage over the head word of a
category name with few modifiers, as if a cate-
gory name contains n modifiers it will generate
n edges incoming to its head word. To overcome
this problem, we defined the modifier number nor-
malization factor W for each category name: it is
defined as the reverse of the number of modifiers
in the category name, and it is multiplied by the
edge score of an edge, generated by the category
name, of the modifier graph. Figure 5 shows the
modifier graph of figure 2 with the modifier num-
ber normalization factor. Since the category name
?Spacecraft escaping the Solar System? has three
modifiers, the scores of edge (escape, Pioneer 11),
(solar, Pioneer 11) and (system, Pioneer 11) are
1/3 = 0.33.
Figure 5: Modifier graph of the subset of
U(Pioneer 11, 3), with modifier number normal-
ization factor.
Removing roleOf Relation (E). To distinguish
the roleOf relation from taxonomic relation,we in-
troduce a new E. This feature simply classify the
link <A, B> as non-instanceOf if category name
A has endings like -er, -ers, -or, -ors, -ian, -ians.
Since only the terminal node can represent the
name of person in category structure, we applied
this feature to classify only article-category links.
One of the example from Wikipedia which should
be judged as roleOf relation is <La Liga foot-
baller, Cristiano Ronaldo>.
After applying above four modifications, we get
the result in table 4. Now, top 3 links all represent
instanceOf links.

4 Implementation
We implemented a combinatory system that com-
bines the algorithm suggested by this paper with
existing lexical pattern-based algorithms. More
precisely, we set two parameters? and ?, in which
? has a consistently higher value than ?. If score
of the given category link, which is retrieved by
the proposed system, is higher than ?, it is classi-
fied as isa/instanceOf. If the score is higher than ?
but lower or equal to ?, the system uses an exist-
ing lexical pattern-based algorithm to classify the
link. If the score is lower than or equal to ?, it is
classified as not isa/instanceOf.
To test the system, we used Wikipedia?s
category structure, which contains 1,160,248
category-category links and 15,778,801 article-
category links between 505,277 categories and
6,808,543 articles. We extract category links from
the Wikipedia category structure and annotate
them to construct the test corpus. During the pro-
cess of choosing category links, we intentionally
removed category links with names containing
any of the following words: ?stub?, ?wikiproject?,
?wikipedia?, ?template?, ?article?, ?start-class?,
?category?, ?redirect?, ?mediawiki?, ?user?, ?por-
tal?, ?page?, and ?list?. These words are normally
used to represent Wikipedia maintenance pages.
After we remove the links described before, we
randomly choose 3,951 category-category links
and 1,688 article-category links. Two annotators
worked separately to annotate whether or not the
given link is an isa/instanceOf link, and in the
event of conflict they would discuss the case and
make a final decision.
We carried out experiments on category-
category link set and article-category link set sep-
arately, since their characteristics are different.
We assumed that the taxonomic relation in a
category-category link is an isa link, while the tax-
onomic relation in an article-category link is an in-
stanceOf link. To acquire the upper category set,
we set n=3 throughout the experiment. For head
word extraction, the method of Collins (1999) is
used, and for lemmatization we used the Lingpipe
toolkit (Alias-i, 2008).
4.1 Experiments on category-category link
We divided the 3,951 category-category links into
two equally-sized sets, and used one set as a train-
ing set and the other one as a test set. The training
set was used to identify the ? and ? values for
isa link classification: in other words, the ? and
? values that showed the best performance when
applied to training set were selected as the actual
parameters used by the system. As Wikipedia?s
category structure contains a huge number of cat-
egory links, precision is more important than re-
call. As recall cannot be ignored, we chose the
parameters that gave the highest precision on the
training set, while giving a recall of at least 0.7.
Also, we carried out experiments on three base-
line systems.The first one determined every link
as an isa link. The second one applied the head
word matching rule (M) only, which says that for
category-category link<A, B>, if the head words
of A and B are the same, then <A, B> should
be classified as an isa link. The third one applies
the method of Ponzetto (P) (Ponzetto and Strube,
2007). The ruleset of Ponzetto includes Head
word matching rule, Modifier-head word match-
ing rule(Ex. <Crime, Crime Comics>: Head
word of ?Crime? and modifier of ?Crime Comics?
matches: Not isa), and the plurality rule used by
YAGO system(Explained at the next chapter)).
Table 5 shows the baseline results, the results
of existing systems, and our best results on the
test set. Usage of authority score is represented
as A, and usage of hub score is represented as H.
Also,we did experiments on all possible combina-
55
tion of features A, H, I, D, C, W, M, P. For exam-
ple, Comb(AHICDM) means that we used feature
A, H, I, C, D to construct the modifier graph and
score the category link, and for those whose score
is between ? and ? we used head word matching
rule to classify them. At the table, P stands for
Precision, R stands for Recall, and F stands for
F-measure.

Table 5: Experimental result on test set of
category-category links: Baseline vs. System best
result
As you can observe, the precision of head-word
matching (M) is high, meaning that in many cases
the head word represents the intrinsic property.
Also, its recall shows that for category-category
links, at least more than half of the categories are
categorized using the intrinsic property of the ob-
jects grouped within them, which strongly sup-
ports lemma 2 in section 3.2. The comparison of
setting M and AHM, P and AHP shows that the
intrinsic-property based approach increases recall
of the existing system about 7-10 %, at the cost of
of 2-6 % precision loss. This shows that, rather
than looking only at the given category link and
analyzing patterns on its name, by gathering in-
formation from the upper category set, we were
able to significantly increase recall. However, it
also shows that some ?garbage? information is in-
troduced through the upper category set, resulting
in a 2-6 % precision loss. The best system shows
about a 8-10 % increase in recall, with compara-
bly good precision compared to the two baseline
systems.
4.2 Experiments on article-category link
In a similar manner to the experiments on
category-category links, we divided the 1,688
article-category links into two equally-sized sets,
and used one set as a training set and the other one
as a test set. The training set is used to determine
the parameters for instanceOf link classification.
The parameter setting procedure was the same as
in the experiments on category-category links, ex-
cept that we used the article-category links for the
procedure. In this experiment, we also adapted
three baseline systems. The first system classi-
fies every link as an instanceOf link, the second
system adapts the head word matching rule (M),
and the third system applies the rule from Yago
(Y) (Suchanek et al, 2007), which states that for
article-category link <A, B>, if A is plural then
the link could be classified as an instanceOf rela-
tion.
Setting P R F
Baseline1 0.5261 1.0 0.6894
Baseline2(M) 0.7451 0.0856 0.1535
Baseline3(Y) 0.6036 0.5315 0.5653

Table 6: Experimental result on test set of article-
category links on some settings
Table 6 shows the baseline results and the best
results of the combinatory system. As you can ob-
serve from the above table, M (head word match-
ing rule) does not work well in article-category
links, although its precision is still high or compa-
rable to that of other methods. Since in most cases
an article represents one instance, in many cases
they have their own name, making the recall of
the head word matching rule extremely low. Also,
the combination system 1 (AHY) shows compa-
rable precision with Y but 14 % higher in reall,
resulting 7 % increse in F-Measure.The best sys-
tem shows about 18 % increase in F-measure, es-
pecially 15 % precision increase and 21 % recall
increase compared to YAGO system.
5 Conclusion and Future work
In this paper, we explored a intrinsic token-based
approach to the problem of classifying whether a
category link is a taxonomic relation or not. Un-
like previous works that classify category links,
we acquired the definition of a lower category
56
name by extracting intrinsic tokens and using
them to score the given category link, rather than
by applying predefined lexical rules to the cat-
egory link. Our intrinsic token-based approach
leads to a significant improvement in F-measure
compared to previous state-of-the-art systems.
One possible future direction for research is au-
tomatic instance population, by using those ex-
tracted intrinsic tokens and gathering taxonomic
relations from the category structure.
