Abstract 
This paper is to introduce our participation in 
the WMT13 shared tasks on Quality Estima-
tion for machine translation without using ref-
erence translations. We submitted the results 
for Task 1.1 (sentence-level quality estima-
tion), Task 1.2 (system selection) and Task 2 
(word-level quality estimation). In Task 1.1, 
we used an enhanced version of BLEU metric 
without using reference translations to evalu-
ate the translation quality. In Task 1.2, we uti-
lized a probability model Na?ve Bayes (NB) as 
a classification algorithm with the features 
borrowed from the traditional evaluation met-
rics. In Task 2, to take the contextual infor-
mation into account, we employed a discrimi-
native undirected probabilistic graphical mod-
el Conditional random field (CRF), in addition 
to the NB algorithm. The training experiments 
on the past WMT corpora showed that the de-
signed methods of this paper yielded promis-
ing results especially the statistical models of 
CRF and NB. The official results show that 
our CRF model achieved the highest F-score 
0.8297 in binary classification of Task 2. 
 
1 Introduction 
Due to the fast development of Machine transla-
tion, different automatic evaluation methods for 
the translation quality have been proposed in re-
cent years. One of the categories is the lexical 
similarity based metric. This kind of metrics in-
cludes the edit distance based method, such as 
WER (Su et al, 1992), Multi-reference WER 
(Nie?en et al, 2000), PER (Tillmann et al, 
1997), the works of (Akiba, et al, 2001), 
(Leusch et al, 2006) and (Wang and Manning, 
2012); the precision based method, such as 
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), NIST (Doddington, 
2002), and SIA (Liu and Gildea, 2006); recall 
based method, such as ROUGE (Lin and Hovy 
2003); and the combination of precision and re-
call, such as GTM (Turian et al, 2003), METE-
OR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), BLANC (Lita et 
al., 2005), AMBER (Chen and Kuhn, 2011), 
PORT (Chen et al, 2012b), and LEPOR (Han et 
al., 2012). 
Another category is the using of linguistic fea-
tures. This kind of metrics includes the syntactic 
similarity, such as the POS information used by 
TESLA (Dahlmeier et al, 2011), (Liu et al, 
2010) and (Han et al, 2013), phrase information 
used by (Povlsen, et al, 1998) and (Echizen-ya 
and Araki, 2010), sentence structure used by 
(Owczarzak et al, 2007); the semantic similarity, 
such as textual entailment used by (Mirkin et al, 
2009) and (Castillo and Estrella, 2012), Syno-
nyms used by METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 
2007), (Wong and Kit, 2012), (Chan and Ng, 
2008); paraphrase used by (Snover et al, 2009). 
The traditional evaluation metrics tend to 
evaluate the hypothesis translation as compared 
to the reference translations that are usually of-
fered by human efforts. However, in the practice, 
there is usually no golden reference for the trans-
lated documents, especially on the internet works. 
How to evaluate the quality of automatically 
translated documents or sentences without using 
the reference translations becomes a new chal-
lenge in front of the NLP researchers.

2 Related Works 
Gamon et al (2005) perform a research about 
reference-free SMT evaluation method on sen-
tence level. This work uses both linear and non-
linear combinations of language model and SVM 
classifier to find the badly translated sentences. 
Albrecht and Hwa (2007) conduct the sentence-
level MT evaluation utilizing the regression 
learning and based on a set of weaker indicators 
of fluency and adequacy as pseudo references. 
Specia and Gimenez (2010) use the Confidence 
Estimation features and a learning mechanism 
trained on human annotations. They show that 
the developed models are highly biased by diffi-
culty level of the input segment, therefore they 
are not appropriate for comparing multiple sys-
tems that translate the same input segments. Spe-
cia et al (2010) discussed the issues between the 
traditional machine translation evaluation and the 
quality estimation tasks recently proposed. The 
traditional MT evaluation metrics require refer-
ence translations in order to measure a score re-
flecting some aspects of its quality, e.g. the 
BLEU and NIST. The quality estimation ad-
dresses this problem by evaluating the quality of 
translations as a prediction task and the features 
are usually extracted from the source sentences 
and target (translated) sentences. They also show 
that the developed methods correlate better with 
human judgments at segment level as compared 
to traditional metrics. Popovi? et al (2011) per-
form the MT evaluation using the IBM model 
one with the information of morphemes, 4-gram 
POS and lexicon probabilities. Mehdad et al 
(2012) use the cross-lingual textual entailment to 
push semantics into the MT evaluation without 
using reference translations. This evaluation 
work mainly focuses on the adequacy estimation. 
Avramidis (2012) performs an automatic sen-
tence-level ranking of multiple machine transla-
tions using the features of verbs, nouns, sentenc-
es, subordinate clauses and punctuation occur-
rences to derive the adequacy information. Other 
descriptions of the MT Quality Estimation tasks 
can be gained in the works of (Callison-Burch et 
al., 2012) and (Felice and Specia, 2012). 
3 Tasks Information  
This section introduces the different sub-tasks we 
participated in the Quality Estimation task of 
WMT 13 and the methods we used.  
3.1 Task 1-1 Sentence-level QE 
Task 1.1 is to score and rank the post-editing 
effort of the automatically translated English-
Spanish sentences without offering the reference 
translation. 
Firstly, we develop the English and Spanish 
POS tagset mapping as shown in Table 1. The 75 
Spanish POS tags yielded by the Treetagger 
(Schmid, 1994) are mapped to the 12 universal 
tags developed in (Petrov et al, 2012). The Eng-
lish POS tags are extracted from the parsed sen-
tences using the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 
2006). 
Secondly, the enhanced version of BLEU 
(EBLEU) formula is designed with the factors of 
modified length penalty (   ), precision, and 
recall, the   and   representing the lengths of 
hypothesis (target) sentence and source sentence 
respectively. We use the harmonic mean of pre-
cision and recall, i.e.  (       ). We assign 
the weight values     and    , i.e. higher 
weight value is assigned to precision, which is 
different with METEOR (the inverse values).

Lastly, the scoring for the post-editing effort 
of the automatically translated sentences is per-
formed on the extracted POS sequences of the 
source and target languages. The evaluated per-
formance of EBLEU on WMT 12 corpus is 
shown in Table 2 using the Mean-Average-Error 
(MAE), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE).  
 
 Precision Recall MLP EBLEU 
MAE 0.17 0.19 0.25 0.16 
RMSE 0.22 0.24 0.30 0.21 
Table 2: Performance on the WMT12 corpus 
The official evaluation scores of the testing re-
sults on WMT 13 corpus are shown in Table 3. 
The testing results show similar scores as com-
pared to the training scores (the MAE score is 
around 0.16 and the RMSE score is around 0.22), 
which shows a stable performance of the devel-
oped model EBLEU. However, the performance 
of EBLEU is not satisfactory currently as shown 
in the Table 2 and Table 3. This is due to the fact 
that we only used the POS information as lin-
guistic feature. This could be further improved 
by the combination of lexical information and 
other linguistic features such as the sentence 
structure, phrase similarity, and text entailment.

3.2 Task 1-2 System Selection 
Task 1.2 is the system selection task on EN-ES 
and DE-EN language pairs. Participants are re-
quired to rank up to five alternative translations 
for the same source sentence produced by multi-
ple translation systems.  
Firstly, we describe the two variants of 
EBLEU method for this task. We score the five 
alternative translation sentences as compared to 
the source sentence according to the closeness of 
their POS sequences. The German POS is also 
extracted using Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 
2006). The mapping of German POS to universal 
POS tagset is using the developed one in the 
work of (Petrov et al, 2012). When we convert 
the absolute scores into the corresponding rank 
values, the variant EBLEU-I means that we use 
five fixed intervals (with the span from 0 to 1) to 
achieve the alignment as shown in Table 4. 
[1,0.4) [0.4, 0.3) [0.3, 0.25) [0.25, 0.2) [0.2, 0] 
5 4 3 2 1 
Table 4: Convert absolute scores into ranks 
 
The alignment work from absolute scores to 
rank values shown in Table 4 is empirically de-
termined. We have made a statistical work on the 
absolute scores yielded by our metrics, and each 
of the intervals shown in Table 4 covers the simi-
lar number of sentence scores. 
On the other hand, in the metric EBLEU-A, 
?A? means average. The absolute sentence edit 
scores are converted into the five rank values 
with the same number (average number). For 
instance, if there are 1000 sentence scores in to-
tal then each rank level (from 1 to 5) will gain 
200 scores from the best to the worst. 
Secondly, we introduce the NB-LPR model 
used in this task. NB-LPR means the Na?ve 
Bayes classification algorithm using the features 
of Length penalty (introduced in previous sec-
tion), Precision, Recall and Rank values. NB-
LPR considers each of its features independently. 
Let?s see the conditional probability that is also 
known as Bayes? rule. If the  ( | )  is given, 
then the  ( | ) can be calculated as follows: 
 
  ( | )  
 ( | ) ( )
 ( )
 (5) 
 
Given a data point identified as 
 (          ) and the classifications 
 (          ), Bayes? rule can be applied to 
this statement: 
 
  (  |          )  
 (         |  ) (  )
 (         )
 (6) 
 
As in many practical applications, parameter 
estimation for NB-LPR model uses the method 
of maximum likelihood. For details of Na?ve 
Bayes algorithm, see the works of (Zhang, 2004) 
and (Harrington, 2012). 
Thirdly, the SVM-LPR model means the sup-
port vector machine classification algorithm us-
ing the features of Length penalty, Precision, 
Recall and Rank values, i.e. the same features as 
in NB-LPR. SVM solves the nonlinear classifica-
tion problem by mapping the data from a low 
dimensional space to a high dimensional space 
using the Kernel methods. In the projected high 
dimensional space, the problem usually becomes 
a linear one, which is easier to solve. SVM is 
also called maximum interval classifier because 
it tries to find the optimized hyper plane that 
367
separates different classes with the largest mar-
gin, which is usually a quadratic optimization 
problem. Let?s see the formula below, we should 
find the points with the smallest margin to the 
hyper plane and then maximize this margin. 
 
          {    (      ( 
    ))  
 
? ?
}

where   is normal to the hyper plane, || || is 
the Euclidean norm of  , and | | || ||  is the 
perpendicular distance from the hyper plane to 
the origin. For details of SVM, see the works of 
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) and (Burges, 1998).

Table 5: NB-LPR and SVM-LPR training 
In the training stage, we used all the officially 
released data of WMT 09, 10, 11 and 12 for the 
EN-ES and DE-EN language pairs. We used the 
WEKA (Hall et al, 2009) data mining software 
to implement the NB and SVM algorithms. The 
training scores are shown in Table 5. The NB-
LPR performs lower scores than the SVM-LPR 
but faster than SVM-LPR.

Table 6: QE Task 1.2 testing scores 
The official testing scores are shown in Table 
6. Each task is allowed to submit up to two sys-
tems and we submitted the results using the 
methods of EBLEU and NB-LPR. The perfor-
mance of NB-LPR on EN-ES language pair 
shows higher Tau score (0.07) than the baseline 
system score (0.03) when the ties are ignored. 
Because of the number limitation of submitted 
systems for each task, we did not submit the 
SVM-LPR results. However, the training exper-
iments prove that the SVM-LPR model performs 
better than the NB-LPR model though SVM-
LPR takes more time to run. 
3.3 Task 2 Word-level QE 
Task 2 is the word-level quality estimation of 
automatically translated news sentences from 
English to Spanish without given reference trans-
lations. Participants are required to judge each 
translated word by assigning a two- or multi-
class labels. In the binary classification, a good 
or a bad label should be judged, where ?bad? 
indicates the need for editing the token. In the 
multi-class classification, the labels include 
?keep?, ?delete? and ?substitute?. In addition to 
the NB method, in this task, we utilized a dis-
criminative undirected probabilistic graphical 
model, i.e. Conditional Random Field (CRF). 
CRF is early employed by Lefferty (Lefferty 
et al, 2001) to deal with the labeling problems of 
sequence data, and is widely used later by other 
researchers. As the preparation for CRF defini-
tion, we assume that   is a variable representing 
the input sequence, and   is another variable rep-
resenting the corresponding labels to be attached 
to  . The two variables interact as conditional 
probability  ( | )  mathematically. Then the 
definition of CRF: Let a graph model   (   ) 
comprise a set   of vertices or nodes together 
with a set   of edges or lines and      |  
  , such that   is indexed by the vertices of  , 
then (   ) shapes a CRF model. This set meets 
the following form:  
 
   ( | )      
(?     (   |   )       ?     (   |   )     )
 (8) 
 
where   and   represent the data sequence and 
label sequence respectively;    and    are the 
features to be defined;    and    are the parame-
ters trained from the datasets. We used the tool 
CRF++1 to implement the CRF algorithm. The 
features we used for the NB and CRF are shown 
in Table 7. We firstly trained the CRF and NB 
models on the officially released training corpus 
(produced by Moses and annotated by computing 
TER with some tweaks). Then we removed the 
truth labels in the training corpus (we call it 
pseudo test corpus) and labeled each word using 
the derived training models. The test results on 
the pseudo test corpus are shown in Table 8,

which specifies CRF performs better than NB 
algorithm.

Table 9: QE Task 2 official testing scores 
The results show that our method CRF yields 
a higher recall score than other systems in binary 
judgments task, and this leads to the highest F1 
score (harmonic mean of precision and recall). 
The recall value reflects the loyalty to the truth 
data. The augmented feature set designed in this 
paper allows the CRF to take the contextual in-
formation into account, and this contributes 
much to the recall score. On the other hand, the 
accuracy score of CRF in multiclass evaluation is 
lower than LIG-FS method. 
4 Conclusions 
This paper describes the algorithms and features 
we used in the WMT 13 Quality Estimation tasks. 
In the sentence-level QE task (Task 1.1), we de-
velop an enhanced version of BLEU metric, and 
this shows a potential usage for the traditional 
evaluation criteria. In the newly proposed system 
selection task (Task 1.2) and word-level QE task 
(Task 2), we explore the performances of several 
statistical models including NB, SVM, and CRF, 
of which the CRF performs best, the NB per-
forms lower than SVM but much faster than 
SVM. The official results show that the CRF 
model yields the highest F-score 0.8297 in binary 
classification judgment of word-level QE task.
