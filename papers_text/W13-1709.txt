Abstract 
This paper presents and evaluates approaches 
to automatically score the content correctness 
of spoken responses in a new language test for 
teachers of English as a foreign language who 
are non-native speakers of English. Most ex-
isting tests of English spoken proficiency elic-
it responses that are either very constrained 
(e.g., reading a passage aloud) or are of a pre-
dominantly spontaneous nature (e.g., stating 
an opinion on an issue). However, the assess-
ment discussed in this paper focuses on essen-
tial speaking skills that English teachers need 
in order to be effective communicators in their 
classrooms and elicits mostly responses that 
fall in between these extremes and are moder-
ately predictable. In order to automatically 
score the content accuracy of these spoken re-
sponses, we propose three categories of robust 
features, inspired from flexible text matching, 
n-grams, as well as string edit distance met-
rics. The experimental results indicate that 
even based on speech recognizer output, most 
of the feature correlations with human expert 
rater scores are in the range of r = 0.4 to r = 
0.5, and further, that a scoring model for pre-
dicting human rater proficiency scores that in-
cludes our content features can significantly 
outperform a baseline without these features 
(r = 0.56 vs. r = 0.33).  
1 Introduction 
With the increased need for instruction of interna-
tional learners of English as a foreign language 
(EFL), there is a concomitant rise in demand to 
assess the language competence of English teach-
ers who are non-native speakers of English. This 
situation arises because it is neither possible nor 
affordable for countries where English is not spo-
ken as a native language to employ only or even 
mostly native speakers of English as EFL teachers. 
Moreover, as the language of instruction increas-
ingly becomes English in most classrooms, teach-
ers? competence in the productive language 
modality of speaking becomes substantially more 
important than in the past. In order to meet this 
demand for assessing the English language profi-
ciency of teachers of English, a new test, English 
Teachers Language Assessment (ETLA), was de-
veloped recently and piloted in 2012. The test 
comprises items for all four main language modali-
ties: reading, listening, writing and speaking. 
While reading and listening items use a multi-
ple-choice paradigm, test items for speaking and 
writing elicit open responses. For cost and effi-
ciency reasons, we aim to employ automated scor-
ing of written and spoken responses in this test. 
This paper is concerned in particular with the con-
ceptualization, implementation and evaluation of 
features that can assess one aspect of English 
speaking proficiency: the content correctness of a 
test taker?s response. Our automated speech scor-
ing system, SpeechRaterSM
The speaking items in ETLA range in complexi-
ty from reading a text passage aloud to more chal-
lenging tasks requiring multi-sentence responses 
related to typical teaching situations. The items, 
therefore, elicit speech in which predictability 
ranges from high (e.g., reading aloud) to medium 
(e.g., open responses based on teaching material). 
 (Zechner et al, 2009), 
also has features addressing other aspects of speak-
ing proficiency, such as fluency or pronunciation, 
but the details of these features will not be dis-
cussed as part of this paper. 
73
While approaches to capture the content of mostly 
predictable speech have been widely used in the 
past (see, e.g., Alwan et al, 2007; Franco et al, 
2010), this is not the case for responses that exhibit 
considerable variation but are still much shorter 
and more constrained than spontaneous items from 
other language tests, such as TOEFL iBT?
Therefore, the goal of the study reported in this 
paper is to conceptualize, implement and evaluate 
features that can address the subset of ETLA 
speaking items where responses are not strongly 
predictable but are still fairly short and constrained 
by the context of the item stimulus and prompt.
. 
1
To illustrate what an ETLA speaking item may 
look like, we provide a relatively simple example 
here. Suppose the test taker (i.e., an English lan-
guage teacher) is asked to request that the class 
open their textbooks on page 55. We could see a 
range of responses, from ?perfect? (score level 3, 
e.g., ?Please open your textbooks on page 55.? or 
?Please open your textbooks and turn to page 
55.?), to ?good? (score level 2, e.g., ?Please open 
the books on the page 55.?) and to ?poor? (score 
level 1, e.g., ?Open book page 55.?). Again, note 
that for this paper we are not interested in potential 
issues with fluency, such as long pauses or speak-
ing rate, nor with pronunciation or prosody. We 
just look at the content of the test takers? respons-
es, either in idealized form by means of a human 
transcription of what a test taker actually said, or in 
a realistic operational scenario, where we look at 
the output of an ASR system. In both cases, we 
consider the sequence of words only (i.e., a textual 
representation of the test takers? spoken respons-
es). 
 
One important aspect of any features used for con-
tent scoring is that they have to be robust with re-
spect to speech recognition errors. Robustness is 
necessary because we are using an automatic 
speech recognition (ASR) system as a front end, 
and the average word error rate of the system is 
around 27% for moderately predictable item re-
sponses. 
In order to investigate the effectiveness of can-
didate content features in a short-term development 
cycle before a larger amount of pilot data would be 
available, we first conducted a small scale in-house

material, such as text and/or visuals, and a prompt (test ques-
tion) that elicits a response from the test taker. 
data collection effort focusing on the moderately 
predictable spoken items in ETLA. Based on the 
analysis of this mini-corpus, several different cate-
gories of promising features were selected for po-
tential operational use and then evaluated on the 
pilot data. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
provides an overview on related work; Section 3 
describes the in-house data set, the pilot data and 
the ASR system; the developed features are pre-
sented in Section 4; Section 5 presents our experi-
ments; we then discuss our findings in Section 6 
and we conclude the paper in Section 7. 
2 Related Work  
Related to the automated assessment of writing 
free-text, research to date has concentrated mainly 
on two tasks: (1) scoring of short answers (Mitch-
ell et al, 2002; Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; 
Mohler and Mihalcea, 2009) and (2) scoring of 
essays (Foltz et al, 1999; Kanejiya et al, 2003; 
Attali and Burstein, 2006). For example, Leacock 
and Chodorow (2003) built an automated scoring 
system, c-rater?, to evaluate the short constructed 
or free-text responses, where the concepts given in 
test items were modeled, and the presence of these 
expected concepts in students? answers would be 
detected.  
As for the evaluation of free-text essays, Attali 
and Burstein (2006) used a selected set of mean-
ingful features to measure different constructed 
aspects of writing essays, such as grammar, usage, 
mechanics, style, organization, development, lexi-
cal complexity and prompt-specific vocabulary 
usage. In addition, the Intelligent Essay Assessor 
(Foltz et al, 1999) used Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA) to score students? answers by comparing 
them to domain-representative texts. Since LSA is 
based on the bag-of-words model, researchers have 
also tried to expand it by introducing additional 
information, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags 
(Kanejiya et al, 2003).  
In addition, research efforts have also been 
made to evaluate the content relatedness and cor-
rectness for spoken responses. For example, Xie et 
al. (2012) used LSA and Pairwise Mutual Infor-
mation approaches to evaluate the content correct-
ness of unrestricted spontaneous spoken responses. 
Moreover, Chen and Zechner (2011) explored fea-
74
tures related to grammatical complexity in an au-
tomated speech scoring system.  
In order to address the moderately predictable 
speaking test items in the new ETLA, this paper 
presents several different types of features to score 
the content correctness of the elicited spoken re-
sponses. Following a series of experiments and 
comparisons, seven features from three content 
feature categories are selected and evaluated. 
3 Data Sets and ASR System 
This study conducts experiments and evaluations 
based on two different data sets: (1) a small scale 
in-house data collection effort, which was used for 
the design and development of content features; 
and (2) a larger-scale pilot data collection, which 
was used to further evaluate the features selected 
according to the in-house data and to build scoring 
models for the prediction of human proficiency 
scores. 
3.1 In-house Data Collection 
Twenty-two items from ETLA with moderately 
predictable responses were selected for the in-
house data collection.2
                                                          
2 We decided to focus our efforts only on the moderately pre-
dictable items since scoring of highly predictable item types 
has been extensively studied in previous research already. 
 Firstly, 1,053 text responses 
in total for all three score levels (3 = high profi-
ciency, 2 = medium proficiency, 1 = low profi-
ciency) were drafted and collected by human 
experts. In order to simulate the operational scenar-
io with an ASR system in place, a subset of re-
sponses was recorded by a small set of 
predominantly non-native speakers of English. For 
each test item, four responses were randomly se-
lected from each score level, which resulted in 22 
? 3 ? 4 = 264 responses for voice recording. The 
remainder of 789 text responses comprised the set 
for feature development and training. In addition, 
about two thirds of the 264 text responses were 
randomly double-recorded by a second speaker, 
resulting in a speech corpus with 444 spoken re-
sponses in total, used as the evaluation set. Fur-
thermore, all these spoken responses were 
manually transcribed to accommodate the errors 
introduced by reading, such as insertions of various 
speech disfluencies.  
3.2 Pilot Data Collection 
This study uses data from a 2012 pilot administra-
tion of the ETLA assessment. In particular, we fo-
cus on 14 moderately predictable items from the 
pilot, covering 2,308 test takers. In order to build 
the automatic speech recognizer and the scoring 
models, the pilot data were partitioned into five 
different subsets without any speaker and response 
overlaps. The first three data partitions were used 
for training, development and evaluation of the 
speech recognition system (hereafter, ?asrTrain?, 
?asrDev? and ?asrEval?), which included spoken 
responses from both the moderately and highly 
predictable items. The asrTrain partition was fur-
ther used to develop and train the content features 
described below. The remaining two partitions 
were used for training and evaluation of scoring 
models that predicted item scores based on a set of 
features (hereafter, ?smTrain? and ?smEval?), 
where only the spoken responses from 14 moder-
ately predictable items from one pilot form were 
included.   
The detailed partition information is listed in 
Table 1. All these spoken responses have been 
manually transcribed and scored with holistic 
scores from 1 to 3 by trained human expert raters. 
For the smTrain and smEval partitions, there were 
6,367 responses receiving double annotation, and 
the inter-rater correlation was 0.73. Furthermore, 
the average length of responses from smTrain and 
smEval sets was 10.5 words, and the correspond-
ing vocabulary size was 855 (not including partial 
words).

3.3 System Architecture 
Our automated speech scoring system, 
SpeechRater (Zechner et al, 2009), consists of an 
ASR system described below which generates a 
word hypothesis for every response by a test taker, 
including information about timing, energy and 
pitch, and other information from the input audio 
75
file. Next, the feature computation modules take 
the outputs of the ASR system and compute a set 
of features, related to fluency, pronunciation, pros-
ody, as well as content, the focus of this paper. Fi-
nally, a scoring model (linear regression model) is 
trained based on the smTrain set to predict scores 
and then evaluated on unseen data (smEval set). 
3.4 ASR System 
In this study, a state-of-the-art gender-independent 
Hidden Markov Model speech recognition system 
trained on about 800 hours of non-native speech is 
taken as the baseline recognizer, and its language 
model (LM) is then further adapted using the tran-
scriptions from the asrTrain data partition. The 
language model adaptation weights are tuned on 
the asrDev set, and the resulting word error rate 
(WER) on the asrEval set (with both moderately 
and highly predictable responses) is 11.7%, and its 
WER on the subset of 264 moderately predictable 
responses is 19.7%. This speech recognizer is fur-
ther evaluated on both smTrain and smEval sets as 
shown in Table 2, only including moderately pre-
dictable responses.

4 Content Features 
 data sets.  
Following a careful inspection and analysis of the 
collected in-house data (described in Section 3.1 
above), several different categories of content fea-
tures were designed and developed. The initial data 
analysis showed that features need to be able to 
capture very narrow ranges of expressions with 
minor variations, but also should be able to capture 
something like the ?overall accuracy? of expres-
sion, where local word sequences or phrases 
should conform to the expectations of the item de-
sign without requiring that a response follows a 
confined pattern in its entirety. For the former situ-
ation, features like regular expression matches 
                                                          
3 The calculation of WER is based on only the recognized 
outputs with more than one word. Thus, the number of actual-
ly recognized responses is less than that in Table 1, i.e., 3,264 
responses for smTrain and 3,255 responses for smEval. 
 
seem appropriate to be a good match, whereas for 
the latter, more flexible approaches such as n-gram 
models or string edit distance metrics may be more 
appropriate. We list and describe our proposed 
content features in the following section. 
A. Flexible String Matching Metrics 
AI. Regular Expressions 
Since many responses in ETLA are expected to 
follow certain patterns, it is intuitive to construct 
limited regular expressions (RegEx) to match gold 
standard responses for candidates with high profi-
ciency score levels. Accordingly, one type of regu-
lar expression related features, re_match, can be 
extracted to detect whether the test response can be 
matched by any of the pre-built regular expres-
sions. This feature can obtain the values of 0 (does 
not match), 1 (partially matches) and 2 (exactly 
matches). Here, a partial match indicates that a 
RegEx can be matched within a test response that 
also has other spoken material, which is useful 
when the speaker repeats or corrects the answer 
multiple times in a single item response, and the 
compiled RegEx can still be used to match parts of 
the test response. 
This content feature has the advantage of high 
precision, as it can precisely examine the content 
correctness of the test responses. Thus, the RegEx 
should be compiled to match all the example re-
sponses at the highest score level 3 from the train-
ing set. For some test items with relatively short 
and fixed answer patterns, this feature is quite use-
ful; however, it is very time-consuming and diffi-
cult to manually build regular expressions for 
items with longer and more flexible expressions. 
Meanwhile, the mechanism of exact matching can 
make this feature fail in very small variations of 
expression. Especially when applying this feature 
on ASR output, it is difficult to successfully match 
some content-correct responses that have 
disfluencies or recognition errors. 
Therefore, in order to improve the robustness of 
RegEx, another regular expression related feature 
is proposed. In general, for each item in ETLA, 
some pieces of specific expressions are required in 
a test response to represent its content correctness. 
Accordingly, we can segment the reference re-
sponses into several fragments and identify some 
pieces as key fragments. For example, when look-
ing at the reference response ?Please open your 
76
text books and turn to page 55.? two key fragments 
can be extracted with ?Please open your text 
books? and ?turn to page 55.? We group versions 
of these key fragments from the training corpus 
together and construct regular expressions to match 
each group. Afterwards, a feature can be defined to 
count how many key fragments can be matched by 
a test response, namely num_fragments.  
 
AII. Keyword Detection 
For moderately predictable items on ETLA, key-
word lists can be extracted from the stimulus mate-
rial and the item prompt, containing the words that 
need to be included in a test response by test tak-
ers. Then a feature, num_keywords, can be used to 
examine how many keywords appear in a test re-
sponse, which can be further normalized by the 
number of predefined keywords for each item, i.e., 
percent_keywords. In addition, as some keywords 
may be a phrase with multiple words, such as 
?page 55,? we can split all the keywords into sin-
gle words and get another sub-keywords list. Then 
two corresponding features can be extracted as 
num_sub_keywords and percent_sub_keywords. 
B. N-grams 
BI. Word N-grams 
The word n-gram model is introduced here to cap-
ture the similarity of word usage between the test 
and the reference responses. Based on the collected 
training samples, trigrams are trained using the text 
responses from the highest score level 3. Then, the 
LM can be used to score a test response, and the 
resulting probability can be taken as feature, called 
lm_3.  
 
BII. POS Similarity 
This feature measures the syntactic complexity of 
test responses based on the distribution of POS 
tags. First, all the responses from the training data 
set are assigned with POS tag sequences via an 
automatic POS tagger. Then, a POS vector accord-
ing to each score level can be obtained by gather-
ing the POS unigram, bigram or trigram statistics 
from the same score level. 
Given a test response, its corresponding POS 
sequence can be determined by the same POS tag-
ger, and the cosine similarities between the test 
POS n-gram vector and the POS vectors from three 
different score levels can be calculated as pos_1, 
pos_2 and pos_3, where pos_3 is used as a feature 
in our experiments below. Furthermore, by com-
paring these three cosine similarities, the score cat-
egory with the highest similarity can be extracted 
as another feature, i.e., pos_score. 
 
BIII. Machine Translation Evaluation Metric 
(BLEU) 
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) is one of the most 
popular metrics for automatic evaluation of ma-
chine translation, where the score is calculated 
based on the modified n-gram precision. In this 
study, the BLEU score is introduced to evaluate 
the content quality of a test response, where three 
different gold standard reference corpora are ex-
tracted from the training set according to each 
score level. Similar to the edit distance and WER 
features described below, three BLEU scores are 
calculated by comparing them with reference re-
sponses from each score level (i.e., bleu_1, bleu_2 
and bleu_3). We decide to use the following two 
features for our experiments below: bleu_3 and 
bleu_score, the score level which receives the 
maximum BLEU score.  
C. String Edit Distance Metrics 
CI. String Edit Distance 
As the edit distance is an effective string metric for 
measuring the amount of difference between two 
word sequences, including insertions, deletions and 
substitutions, we use it to capture the sequence dis-
tance between the test and reference responses.  
Given a test response, we can separately calcu-
late the edit distance by comparing it with training 
responses from each score level. Afterwards, the 
minimum edit distance from each score level can 
be extracted as ed_1, ed_2 and ed_3, where ed_3 is 
selected as feature for our experiments. Further-
more, by comparing these three edit distances, the 
score category with the minimum value is taken as 
another feature, ed_score.  
 
CII. Word Error Rate (WER) 
By dividing the edit distance by the length of the 
reference response, we obtain the word error rate 
(WER) metrics, commonly used in speech recogni-
tion, and two additional features, wer_3 and 
wer_score, similarly as above, can be calculated.  
Compared to the above category of n-gram re-
lated features, which capture the n-gram fragment 
77
matching between the test and reference samples, 
the category of edit distance features try to find the 
most similar reference sample to the test sample at 
the whole-response level.  
Finally, all the proposed features are implement-
ed and then examined based on both the ideal hu-
man transcription and the realistic ASR output. 
The speech recognizer used with the small in-
house data is the same as the ASR system de-
scribed in Section 3.4, but its language model is 
adapted with the much smaller set of 789 training 
text responses. The WER of this system is 17.8%, 
evaluated on 444 spoken responses. 
In addition, in order to increase the robustness of 
the extracted features, a preprocessing stage is in-
troduced to remove all the disfluencies from the 
ASR output, such as filler words, recognized par-
tial words and repeated words. Afterwards, each 
feature is evaluated on both the transcription and 
the ASR output of the 444 collected spoken re-
sponses, and its corresponding Pearson correlation 
coefficient with human scores is presented in Table 
3.  
Based on overall correlation, inter-correlation 
analyses, as well as on construct4

 considerations, 
seven content features from three categories are 
selected and will be evaluated on a larger scale on 
ETLA pilot data in the next section: re_match 
(A1), num_fragments (A2), percent_sub_keywords 
(A3), bleu_3 (B1), ed_score (C1), wer_3 (C2) and 
wer_score (C3). 
This section first describes experiments related to 
the performance of the seven selected content fea-
tures on a larger corpus from an ETLA pilot ad-
ministration (described above in Section 3.2). 
Then, a similar analysis is conducted based on hu-
man rater analytic content scores on a subset of 
this data. Finally, the selected content features are 
combined with other features related to pronuncia-
tion, prosody and fluency to build a scoring model 
for the prediction of human scores.

measured by a test. The term ?construct considerations? in the

5.1 Feature Evaluation on Pilot Data 
In the following experiments, we use the asrTrain 
set to train the content features. Then these features 
are examined on the smTrain and smEval data sets. 
In order to extract the edit distance, WER- and 
BLEU-related features for each item, three text 
reference corpora according to different score lev-
els, are needed. Duplicate reference responses with 
the same content are removed within each score 
level.  
Furthermore, we improve two RegEx features 
using the reference responses from the highest 
score level 3 in the asrTrain set. (1) Since the pre-
viously obtained re_match feature based on the in-
house data may not be able to match multiple con-
tent-correct responses in the pilot data, we need to 
augment the set of RegEx for this feature based on 
correct responses from score level 3 in the asrTrain 
set. (2) Since the maximum number of candidate 
fragments varies across different ETLA items, the 
num_fragments feature values are not comparable 
across items. Therefore, we redesign this feature 
by assigning a list of manually selected keywords 
for each fragment. During feature extraction, we 
count the number of distinct keywords associated 
with all the matched fragments and divide this 
number by the number of predefined keywords for 
each item (as in AII. Keyword Detection), which 
results in another feature: perc_fragment_kw (A2).  
Based on the ASR output of smTrain and 
smEval data sets, seven content features are ex-
tracted and their Pearson correlation coefficients 
with the holistic human scores are calculated and 
shown in Table 4.

5.2 Evaluations Using Human Rater Analyt-
ic Content Scores 
 Features include A1 (re_match), A2 
(perc_fragment_kw), A3 (percent_sub_keywords), B1 
(bleu_3), C1 (ed_score), C2 (wer_3) and C3 
(wer_score) 
In addition to the human rating of all spoken re-
sponses of the ETLA pilot data set with holistic 
scores that take into account both the dimensions 
of ?delivery? (fluency, pronunciation, prosody) 
and ?content,? a subset of the data was further 
scored by human expert raters in these two dimen-
sions separately, resulting in so-called analytic 
scores for delivery and content. The inter-
correlation for content analytic scores was 0.79. 
1,410 responses from the smTrain set and 1,402 
responses from the smEval set received such ana-
lytic content scores. On this subset, table 5 shows 
the Pearson correlation coefficients between the 
content features and the analytic content scores, as 
well as the holistic scores, for comparison. 
5.3 Scoring Model Comparison 
We further examine these content features by in-
troducing them in a scoring model to predict hu-
man rater holistic proficiency scores, using 
smTrain for training of the models and smEval for 
their evaluation. The baseline system employs 14 
features related to the construct dimension of de-
livery, such as pronunciation, prosody and fluency.  
                                                          
5 The evaluation is conducted on recognition output with more 
than one word. In addition, due to technical problems, such as 
high background noise, some responses are non-scorable for 
human raters, and these responses are removed from the eval-
uation sets. Finally, there are 3176 responses included in 
smTrain, and 3084 responses in smEval.

6 Discussion 
The goal of this paper was to conceptualize, im-
plement and evaluate features that can determine 
the content correctness of spoken item responses in 
an English language test for teachers of English 
who are not native speakers of English. 
Based on observations from a small in-house da-
ta collection, where human test developers and 
content experts created example responses to 22 
test items for three different score levels, we de-
cided to implement a range of features that can 
capture the content correctness of test takers? re-
sponses in varying degree of precision. Our fea-
79
tures belong to three classes: features related to 
fixed expressions, with potential small variations, 
such as regular expressions or keywords; features 
based on n-grams of words or POS tags, including 
the BLEU metrics frequently used for evaluations 
of machine translation output; and features related 
to measures of string edit distance, including the 
WER metrics commonly used in speech recogni-
tion evaluations.  
It should be noted that we use the term ?content? 
in a fairly broad way in this paper, namely, every-
thing in a spoken response that is not related to 
lower-level aspects of speech production such as 
fluency or pronunciation. Since the scoring rubrics 
for ETLA place a high emphasis both on the 
grammatical accuracy, as well as on the correct 
content (in a more narrow sense), this situation is 
reflected by our choice of features that focus both 
on elements traditionally associated with content 
(such as matching of keywords), as well as on ele-
ments more related to correct grammatical expres-
sions (e.g., sequences of POS tags). 
Our initial evaluations on the small in-house da-
ta collection showed that most of these features 
correlate well with human expert scores, both 
when using transcribed speech as well as when 
using ASR output. The absolute correlations for 
human transcriptions of speech range from r = 
0.144 (bleu_score) to r = 0.789 (re_match), and for 
ASR output from r = 0.194 (bleu_score) to r = 
0.614 (ed_score). The relative drop in correlation 
between these two conditions varies across fea-
tures, but is generally around 5%-15%, with 
re_match having a much larger performance drop 
from r = 0.789 for transcribed speech to r = 0.537 
for ASR output (32% relative decrease in perfor-
mance). 6
From this initial set of 15 features, we selected 
seven features based on feature performance, inter-
correlation analyses (i.e., avoiding features that 
have a high inter-correlation and measure a similar 
aspect of content), and considerations of construct, 
i.e., which features are representing content in a 
way that is consistent with what human experts 
would consider important in determining the con-
tent correctness of a response. This subset of seven 
 
                                                          
6 The correlation of one feature, pos_3, remained unchanged 
between the two conditions, and two features, pos_score and 
bleu_score, showed higher correlations for ASR output than 
for human transcriptions. 
features includes three features each from the clas-
ses of flexible string matching and string edit dis-
tance, and one feature (bleu_3) from the n-gram 
class. 
When evaluating these seven features on a larger 
data set, the smTrain and smEval sets of the 2012 
ETLA pilot data, we find absolute correlations be-
tween features and human holistic scores ranging 
from r = 0.286 to r = 0.480 for ASR output, and 
from r = 0.419 to r = 0.597 for transcriptions. The 
relative decrease in correlation between transcrip-
tions and ASR outputs ranges from 16% to 32% in 
these data sets (smTrain and smEval). The magni-
tude of content feature correlations observed in this 
study is similar to that of features related to fluen-
cy and pronunciation computed on spontaneous 
speech, as reported in Zechner et al (2009). In 
fact, due to the brevity of the moderately predicta-
ble responses in ETLA, features related to fluency 
and pronunciation achieve correlations of less than 
0.3 on this data set, making content features crucial 
for the assessment of speech here. 
When comparing the six content features that 
are identical between the original feature set of 15 
features (in-house data collection) and the final 
feature set, we observe a relative drop in feature 
correlation between the in-house data set and the 
smEval pilot data set between 1% (blue_3) and 
36% (ed_score), with an average decrease of 20%. 
This performance decrease can be explained by (1) 
the more challenging data set of the pilot, as indi-
cated, e.g., by a much higher word error rate of the 
ASR system (27% vs. 18%); and (2) the fact that 
the in-house data collection was much more con-
strained in terms of test taker response variation 
compared to the real-world pilot data. 
Since a subset of the ETLA responses was also 
scored analytically by human raters, we could fur-
ther compare the feature correlations between ho-
listic vs. analytic content scores (Section 5.2). We 
find that on smEval, for all features, absolute cor-
relations increase on human analytic content scores 
compared to human holistic scores. Although these 
differences are rather small (0.01 to 0.04), this is 
an indicator that our features are measuring what 
they are supposed to measure, since the holistic 
scores also take other dimensions of speech, such 
as fluency and pronunciation, into account.

7 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper presented a study whose aim was to 
conceptualize, implement and evaluate features to 
measure the content correctness of test takers? re-
sponses in a new assessment for EFL teachers 
whose native language is not English. 
We implemented and evaluated an initial set of 
15 content features from three feature classes: flex-
ible string matching, n-grams and string edit dis-
tance metrics. A subset of these features was then 
evaluated on a 2012 ETLA pilot administration, 
and we found correlations between features and 
human holistic scores in the range of r = 0.29 to r 
= 0.48 on ASR output. Correlations increased 
when comparing features with human analytic con-
tent scores. 
Finally, we compared a baseline regression scor-
ing model for prediction of human holistic scores 
without any content features to an extended model 
using seven content features and found that the 
model correlation substantially improved from r = 
0.33 (baseline) to r = 0.56 (extended model). 
Future work will include devising strategies on 
how to obtain RegEx features more quickly in a 
semi-automated way in order to reduce human la-
bor. Further, we plan more in-depth analysis of the 
feature performance across different test items and 
item types which potentially could lead to further 
improvements and refinements of our content fea-
tures.
