Accurate Methods for the Statistics 
of Surprise and Coincidence

Much work has been done on the statistical analysis of text. In some cases reported in the lit- 
erature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results 
have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used 
unjustifiably, leading to flawed results. 
This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortu- 
nately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text. 
However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good 
results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been 
used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. 
In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases 
where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here 
are nearly identical. 
This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to 
the analysis of text. 
1. Introduction 
There has been a recent rend back towards the statistical analysis of text. This trend 
has resulted in a number of researchers doing good work in information retrieval and 
natural anguage processing in general. Unfortunately much of their work has been 
characterized by a cavalier approach to the statistical issues raised by the results. 
The approaches taken by such researchers can be divided into three rough cate- 
gories. 
. 
. 
Collect enormous volumes of text in order to make straightforward, 
statistically based measures work well. 
Do simple-minded statistical analysis on relatively small volumes of text 
and either 'correct empirically' for the error or ignore the issue. 
3. Perform no statistical analysis whatsoever. 
The first approach is the one taken by the IBM group researching statistical ap- 
proaches to machine translation (Brown et al 1989). They have collected nearly one

billion words of English text from such diverse sources as internal memos, technical 
manuals, and romance novels, and have aligned most of the electronically available 
portion of the record of debate in the Canadian parliament (Hansards). Their efforts 
have been Augean, and they have been well rewarded by interesting results. The sta- 
tistical significance of most of their work is above reproach, but the required volumes 
of text are simply impractical in many settings. 
The second approach is typified by much of the work of Gale and Church (Gale 
and Church this issue, and in press; Church et al 1989). Many of the results from their 
work are entirely usable, and the measures they use work well for the examples given 
in their papers. In general, though, their methods lead to problems. For example, mu- 
tual information estimates based directly on counts are subject o overestimation when 
the counts involved are small, and z-scores ubstantially overestimate the significance 
of rare events. 
The third approach is typified by virtually all of the information-retrieval literature. 
Even recent and very innovative work such as that using Latent Semantic Indexing 
(Dumais et al 1988) and Pathfinder Networks (Schvaneveldt 1990) has not addressed 
the statistical reliability of the internal processing. They do, however, use good statis- 
tical methods to analyze the overall effectiveness of their approach. 
Even such well-accepted techniques as inverse document frequency weighting of 
terms in text retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983) is generally only justified on very 
sketchy grounds. 
The goal of this paper is to present a practical measure that is motivated by statis- 
tical considerations and that can be used in a number of settings. This measure works 
reasonably well with both large and small text samples and allows direct comparison 
of the significance of rare and common phenomena. This comparison is possible be- 
cause the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more 
traditional measures. 
In the following, some sections are composed largely of background material or 
mathematical details and can probably be skipped by the reader familiar with statistics 
or by the reader in a hurry. The sections that should not be skipped are marked with 
**, those with substantial background with *, and detailed erivations are unmarked. 
This 'good parts' convention should make this paper more useful to the implementer 
or reader only wishing to skim the paper. 
2. The Assumption of Normality * 
The assumption that simple functions of the random variables being sampled are 
distributed normally or approximately normally underlies many common statistical 
tests. This particularly includes Pearson's X2 test and z-score tests. This assumption is 
absolutely valid in many cases. Due to the simplification of the methods involved, it 
is entirely justifiable ven in marginal cases. 
When comparing the rates of occurrence of rare events, the assumptions on which 
these tests are based break down because texts are composed largely of such rare 
events. For example, simple word counts made on a moderate-sized corpus show 
that words that have a frequency of less than one in 50,000 words make up about 
20-30% of typical English language news-wire reports. This 'rare' quarter of English 
includes many of the content-bearing words and nearly all the technical jargon. As an 
illustration, the following is a random selection of approximately 0.2% of the words 
found at least once but fewer than five times in a sample of a half million words of 
Reuters' reports.

The only word in this list that is in the least obscure is poi (a native Hawaiian dish 
made from taro root). If we were to sample 50,000 words instead of the half million 
used to create the list above, then the expected number of occurrences of any of the 
words in this list would be less than one hall well below the point where commonly 
used tests should be used. 
If such ordinary words are 'rare,' any statistical work with texts must deal with 
the reality of rare events. It is interesting that while most of the words in running text 
are common ones, most of the words in the total vocabulary are rare. 
Unfortunately, the foundational ssumption of most common statistical analyses 
used in computational linguistics is that the events being analyzed are relatively com- 
mon. For a sample of 50,000 words from the Reuters' corpus mentioned previously, 
none of the words in the table above is common enough to expect such analyses to 
work well. 
3. The Tradition of Chi-Squared Tests * 
In text analysis, the statistically based measures that have been used have usually 
been based on test statistics that are useful because, given certain assumptions, they 
have a known distribution. This distribution is most commonly either the normal or 
X 2 distribution. These measures are very useful and can be used to accurately assess 
significance in a number of different settings. They are based, however, on several 
assumptions that do not hold for most textual analyses. 
The details of how and why the assumptions behind these measures do not hold 
is of interest primarily to the statistician, but the result is of interest o the statistical 
consumer (in our case, somebody interested in counting words). More applicable tech- 
niques are important in textual analysis. The next section describes one such technique; 
implementation f this technique is described in later sections.

4. Binomial  Distr ibutions for Text Analysis ** 
Binomial distributions arise commonly in statistical nalysis when the data to be ana- 
lyzed are derived by counting the number of positive outcomes of repeated identical 
and independent experiments. Flipping a coin is the prototypical experiment of this 
sort. 
The task of counting words can be cast into the form of a repeated sequence 
of such binary trials comparing each word in a text with the word being counted. 
These comparisons can be viewed as a sequence of binary experiments similar to coin 
flipping. In text, each comparison is clearly not independent of all others, but the 
dependency falls off rapidly with distance. Another assumption that works relatively 
well in practice is that the probability of seeing a particular word does not vary. Of 
course, this is not really true, since changes in topic may cause this frequency to 
vary. Indeed it is the mild failure of this assumption that makes shallow information 
retrieval techniques possible. 
To the extent hat these assumptions of independence and stationarity are valid, 
we can switch to an abstract discourse concerning Bernoulli trials instead of words in 
text, and a number of standard results can be used. A Bernoulli trial is the statistical 
idealization of a coin flip in which there is a fixed probability of a successful outcome 
that does not vary from flip to flip. 
In particular, if the actual probability that the next word matches a prototype is p, 
then the number of matches generated in the next n words is a random variable (K) 
with binomial distribution 
P(K = k) = pk(1-- p)n-k ( n 
whose mean is np and whose variance is np(1 -p). If np(1-p) > 5, then the distribution 
of this variable will be approximately normal, and as np(1 - p) increases beyond that 
point, the distribution becomes more and more like a normal distribution. This can be 
seen in Figure 1 above, where the binomial distribution (dashed lines) is plotted along 
with the approximating normal distributions (solid lines) for np set to 5, 10, and 20,

np= 1 0.63 0.5 
with n fixed at 100. Larger values of n with np held constant give curves that are not 
visibly different from those shown. For these cases, np ~ np(1 - p). 
This agreement between the binomial and normal distributions is exactly what 
makes test statistics based on assumptions of normality so useful in the analysis of 
experiments based on counting. In the case of the binomial distribution, normality 
assumptions are generally considered to hold well enough when np(1 - p) > 5. 
The situation is different when np(1 -p)  is less than 5, and is dramatically different 
when np(1 -p )  is less than 1. First, it makes much less sense to approximate a discrete 
distribution such as the binomial with a continuous distribution such as the normal. 
Second, the probabilities computed using the normal approximation are less and less 
accurate. 
Table 1 shows the probabil ity that one or more matches are found in 100 words 
of text as computed using the binomial and normal distributions for np = 0.001, 
np = 0.01, np = 0.1, and np = 1 where n = 100. Most words are sufficiently rare so 
that even for samples of text where n is as large as several thousand, np will be at 
the bottom of this range. Short phrases are so numerous that np << 1 for almost all 
phrases even when n is as large as several million. 
Table 1 shows that for rare events, the normal distribution does not even approx- 
imate the binomial distribution. In fact, for np -- 0.1 and n = 100, using the normal 
distribution overestimates the significance of one or more occurrences by a factor of 
40, while for np = 0.01, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance by 
about 4 x 1020. When n increases beyond 100, the numbers in the table do not change 
significantly. 
If this overestimation were constant, then the estimates using normal distributions 
could be corrected and would still be useful, but the fact that the errors are not constant 
means that methods dependent on the normal approximation should not be used to 
analyze Bernoulli trials where the probabil ity of positive outcome is very small. Yet, 
in many real analyses of text, comparing cases where np -- 0.001 with cases where 
np > 1 is a common problem. 
5. L ike l ihood  Ratio Tests * 
There is another class of tests that do not depend so critically on assumptions of 
normality. Instead they use the asymptotic distribution of the generalized likelihood 
ratio. For text analysis and similar problems, the use of likelihood ratios leads to 
very much improved statistical results. The practical effect of this improvement  is that 
statistical textual analysis can be done effectively with very much smaller volumes of 
text than is necessary for conventional tests based on assumed normal distributions, 
65 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
and it allows comparisons to be made between the significance of the occurrences of
both rare and common phenomenon. 
5.1 Parameter Spaces and Likelihood Functions 
Likelihood ratio tests are based on the idea that statistical hypotheses can be said 
to specify subspaces of the space described by the unknown parameters of the sta- 
tistical model being used. These tests assume that the model is known, but that the 
parameters of the model are unknown. Such a test is called parametric. Other tests are 
available that make no assumptions about he underlying model at all; they are called 
distribution-free. Only one particular parametric test is described here. More informa- 
tion on parametric and distribution-free tests is available in Bradley (1968) and Mood, 
Graybill, and Boes (1974). 
The probability that a given experimental outcome described by kl,..., kn will be 
observed for a given model described by a number of parameters Pl, p2,.., is called 
the likelihood function for the model and is written as 
H(pl,p2,...;kl,...,km) 
where all arguments of H left of the semicolon are model parameters, and all argu- 
ments right of the semicolon are observed values. In the continuous case, the proba- 
bility is replaced by a probability density. With binomial and multinomials, we only 
deal with the discrete case. 
For repeated Bernoulli trials, m = 2 because we observe both the number of trials 
and the number of positive outcomes and there is only one p. The explicit form for 
the likelihood function is 
H(p;n'k)=pk(1-P)"-k ( k ) 
The parameter space is the set of all values for p and the hypothesis that p = p0 
is a single point. For notational brevity the model parameters can be collected into a 
single parameter, as can the observed values. Then the likelihood function is written 
as  
H(~;k) 
where w is considered to be a point in the parameter space f~, and k a point in the 
space of observations K. Particular hypotheses or observations are represented by 
subscripting f~ or K respectively. 
More information about likelihood ratio tests can be found in texts on theoretical 
statistics (Mood et al 1974). 
5.2 The Likelihood Ratio 
The likelihood ratio for a hypothesis  the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood 
function over the subspace represented by the hypothesis to the maximum value of 
the likelihood function over the entire parameter space. That is, 
A = max~f~? H(a;; k) 
max~en H(a;; k) 
where f~ is the entire parameter space and f~0 is the particular hypothesis being tested. 
The particularly important feature of likelihood ratios is that the quantity -2  log )~ 
is asymptotically X 2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in 
dimension between f~ and f~0. Importantly, this asymptote is approached very quickly 
in the case of binomial and multinomial distributions.

5.3 Likelihood Ratio for Binomial and Multinomial Distributions 
The comparison of two binomial or multinomial processes can be done rather easily 
using likelihood ratios. In the case of two binomial distributions, 
H(pl ,p2;k l , r l l ,  ka, na)~-p lk l (1 - -p l )n l -k l  ( nl p2 k2 (1 - p2) n2-k2 (n2).k2 
The hypothesis that the two distributions have the same underlying parameter is 
represented by the set {(pl, p2) I Pl = p2}. 
The likelihood ratio for this test is 
= maxpH(p, p; kl, nl, k2, n2) 
maxpl ,p2 H(pl, P2; kl,//1, k2,//2)" 
These maxima are achieved with Pl = ~ and P2 = ~ for the denominator, and 
for the numerator. This reduces the ratio to P = ~1+~2 
maxp L(p, kl , nl )L(p, k2, n2) 
maxp, ,p2 L(pl , kl , nl )L(p2, k2~ /'/2 )
where 
L(p,k, n) = pk(1 -- p)n-k. 
Taking the logarithm of the likelihood ratio gives 
-2  log ,~ = 2 \[log L(pl, kl, nl) + log L(p2, k2, n2) - log L(p, kl, nl) - log L(p, k2, n2)\] ?
For the multinomial case, it is convenient to use the double subscripts and the abbre- 
viations 
so that we can write 
The likelihood ratio is 
Pi = pli~ p2i~ . . . ~ pji~ . . . 
Ki ~- kli~k2i~...~kji~...~ 
Q = ql,q2~...~qj,...~ 
H(P I 'P2 ;K I 'n l ,K2 ,  n2) = I I  rli! I I  pjikji" 
i=1,2 j kji! 
)~ = maxQ H(Q, Q;K1, nl, K2~ n2) 
max/'l,p2 H ( P1, P2; KI ~ nl , K2~ n2)" 
This can be separated in a similar fashion as the binomial case by using the function

)~= maXQL(Q, K1)L(Q, K2) 
maxp,,e2 L(P1, K1)L(P2, K2)" 
67 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
This expression implicitly involves n because  ~j  kj = n. 
Maximizing and taking the logarithm, 
-2 log A = 2 \[log n(Pl, K 1 ) -}- log L(P2~ K2) -- log L(Q, K~) - log L(Q, K2)\] 
where 
and 
pji - ~-.~ikji 
~i  kji 
qJ - G i j k /  
If the null hypothesis holds, then the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically X 2 dis- 
tributed with k/2 - 1 degrees of freedom. When j is 2 (the binomial), -2  log )~ will be 
X 2 distributed with one degree of freedom. 
If we had initially approximated the binomial distribution with a normal distri- 
bution with mean np and variance np(1 - p), then we would have arrived at another 
form that is a good approximation of -2 log ~ when np(1 - p) is more than roughly 5. 
This form is 
(kji - niqj) 2 
-21og ,~ .~. ~/~/qj~_--q~ 
where 
~ik j i  
qJ = kji 
as in the multinomial case above and 
ni --- y~ kji.

Interestingly, this expression is exactly the test statistic for Pearson's X2 test, although 
the form shown is not quite the customary one. Figure 2 shows the reasonably good 
agreement between this expression and the exact binomial log-likelihood ratio derived 
earlier where p -- 0.1 and nl -- n2 -- 1000 for various values of kl and k2. 
Figure 3, on the other hand, shows the divergence between Pearson's tatistic and 
the log-likelihood ratio when p = 0.01, nl = 100, and n2 -- 10000. Note the large 
change of scale on the vertical axis. The pronounced disparity occurs when k I is larger 
than the value expected based on the observed value of k2. The case where nl < n2 
and ~ > ~ is exactly the case of most interest in many text analyses. 
T~e convergence of the log of the likelihood ratio to the asymptotic distribution is
demonstrated dramatically in Figure 4. In this figure, the straighter line was computed 
using a symbolic algebra package and represents he idealized one degree of freedom 
cumulative X2 distribution. The rougher curve was computed by a numerical experi- 
ment in which p -- 0.01, nl = 100, and n2 = 10000, which corresponds to the situation 
in Figure 3. The close agreement shows that the likelihood ratio measure produces 
accurate results over six decades of significance ven in the range where the normal 
X 2 measure diverges radically from the ideal.

finding pairs of words that occurred next to each other with a significantly higher 
frequency than would be expected, based on the word frequencies alone. The text was 
31,777 words of financial text largely describing market conditions for 1986 and 1987. 
The results of such a bigram analysis hould highlight collocations common in 
English as well as collocations peculiar to the financial nature of the analyzed text. 
As will be seen, the ranking based on likelihood ratio tests does exactly this. Similar 
comparisons made between a large corpus of general text and a domain-specific text 
can be used to produce lists consisting only of words and bigrams characteristic of
the domain-specific texts. 
This comparison was done by creating a contingency table that contained the 
following counts of each bigram that appeared in the text: 
k(A B) I k("~ A B) I 
k(A~B) k(~A ,,~B) 
where the ~ A B represents he bigram in which the first word is not word A and the 
second is word/3. 
If the words A and B occur independently, then we would expect p(AB) = p(A)p(B) 
where p(AB) is the probability of A and B occurring in sequence, p(A) is the probability 
of A appearing in the first position, and p(B) is the probability of B appearing in the 
second position. We can cast this into the mold of our earlier binomial analysis by 
phrasing the null hypothesis that A and B are independent asp(A I B) = p(A \[,~ B) = 
p(A). This means that testing for the independence of A and B can be done by testing 
to see if the distribution of A given that B is present (the first row of the table) is 
the same as the distribution of A given that B is not present (the second row of the 
table). In fact, of course, we are not really doing a statistical test to see if A and B are 
70 
Ted Dunning Accurate Methods for the Statistics 
independent; we know that they are generally not independent in text. Instead we just 
want to use the test statistic as a measure that will help highlight particular As and 
Bs that are highly associated in text. 
These counts were analyzed using the test for binomials described earlier, and the 
50 most significant are tabulated in Table 2. This table contains the most significant 
200 bigrams and is reverse sorted by the first column, which contains the quantity 
-2  log &. Other columns contain the four counts from the contingency table described 
above, and the bigram itself. 
Examination of the table shows that there is good correlation with intuitive feelings 
about how natural the bigrams in the table actually are. This is in distinct contrast with 
Table 3, which contains the same data except hat the first column is computed using 
Pearson's ~2 test statistic. The overestimate of the significance of items that occur only 
a few times is dramatic. In fact, the entire first portion of the table is dominated by 
bigrams rare enough to occur only once in the current sample of text. The misspelling 
in the bigram 'sees posibilities' is in the original text. 
Out of 2693 bigrams analyzed, 2682 of them fall outside the scope of applicability 
of the normal X 2 test. The 11 bigrams that were suitable for analysis with the X 2 test 
are listed in Table 4. It is notable that all of these bigrams contain the word the, which 
is the most common word in English. 
7. Conclusions 
Statistics based on the assumption of normal distribution are invalid in most cases 
of statistical text analysis unless either enormous corpora are used, or the analysis is 
restricted to only the very most common words (that is, the ones least likely to be of 
interest). This fact is typically ignored in much of the work in this field. Using such 
invalid methods may seriously overestimate he significance of relatively rare events. 
Parametric statistical analysis based on the binomial or multinomial distribution ex- 
tends the applicability of statistical methods to much smaller texts than models using 
normal distributions and shows good promise in early applications of the method. 
Further work is needed to develop software tools to allow the straightforward 
analysis of texts using these methods. Some of these tools have been developed and 
will be distributed by the Consortium for Lexical Research. For further information 
on this software, contact he author or the Consortium via e-mail at ted@nmsu.edu or
lexical@nmsu.edu. 
In addition, there are a wide variety of distribution free methods that may avoid 
even the assumption that text can be modeled by multinomial distributions. Measures 
based on Fischer's exact method may prove even more satisfactory than the likelihood 
ratio measures described in this paper. Also, using the Poisson distribution instead of 
the multinomial as the limiting distribution for the distribution of counts may provide 
some benefits. All of these possibilities hould be tested.
