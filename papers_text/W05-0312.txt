Abstract
In this paper we examine the issues that
arise from the annotation of the discourse
connectives for the Chinese Discourse
Treebank Project. This project is based on
the same principles as the PDTB, a project
that annotates the English discourse con-
nectives in the Penn Treebank. The pa-
per begins by outlining range of discourse
connectives under consideration in this
project and examines the distribution of
the explicit discourse connectives. We
then examine the types of syntactic units
that can be arguments to the discourse
connectives. We show that one of the
most challenging issues in this type of dis-
course annotation is determining the tex-
tual spans of the arguments and this is
partly due to the hierarchical nature of dis-
course relations. Finally, we discuss sense
discrimination of the discourse connec-
tives, which involves separating discourse
connective from non-discourse connective
senses and teasing apart the different dis-
course connective senses, and discourse
connective variation, the use of differ-
ent connectives to represent the same dis-
course relation.

1 Introduction
The goal of the Chinese Discourse Treebank
(CDTB) Project is to add a layer of discourse anno-
tation to the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al, To
appear), the bulk of which has also been annotated
with predicate-argument structures. This project
is focused on discourse connectives, which include
explicit connectives such as subordinate and coor-
dinate conjunctions, discourse adverbials, as well
as implicit discourse connectives that are inferable
from neighboring sentences. Like the Penn English
Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al, 2004a; Milt-
sakaki et al, 2004b), the CDTB project adopts the
general idea presented in (Webber and Joshi, 1998;
Webber et al, 1999; Webber et al, 2003) where
discourse connectives are considered to be predi-
cates that take abstract objects such as propositions,
events and situations as their arguments. This ap-
proach departs from the previous approaches to dis-
course analysis such as the Rhetorical Structure The-
ory (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al,
2003) in that it does not start from a predefined in-
ventory of abstract discourse relations. Instead, all
discourse relations are lexically grounded and an-
chored by a discourse connective. The discourse
relations so defined can be structural or anaphoric.
Structural discourse relations, generally anchored by
subordinate and coordinate conjunctions, hold lo-
cally between two adjacent units of discourse (such
as clauses). In contrast, anaphoric discourse rela-
tions are generally anchored by discourse adverbials
and only one argument can be identified structurally
in the local context while the other can only be de-
84
rived anaphorically in the previous discourse. An
advantage of this approach to discourse analysis is
that discourse relations can be built up incrementally
in a bottom-up manner and this advantage is magni-
fied in large-scale annotation projects where inter-
annotator agreement is crucial and has been verified
in the construction of the Penn English Discourse
Treebank (Miltsakaki et al, 2004a). This approach
closely parallels the annotation of the the verbs in
the English and Chinese Propbanks (Palmer et al,
2005; Xue and Palmer, 2003), where verbs are the
anchors of predicate-argument structures. The dif-
ference is that the extents of the arguments to dis-
course connectives are far less certain, while the ar-
ity of the predcates is fixed for the discourse connec-
tives.
This paper outlines the issues that arise from the
annotation of Chinese discourse connectives, with
an initial focus on explicit discourse connectives.
Section 2 gives an overview of the different kinds
of discourse connectives that we plan to annotate
for the CDTB Project. Section 3 surveys the dis-
tribution of the discourse connectives and Section
4 describes the kinds of discourse units that can be
arguments to the discourse connectives. Section 5
specifies the scope of the arguments of discourse re-
lations and describes what should be included in or
excluded from the text span of the arguments. Sec-
tions 6 and 7 describes the need for a mechanism
to address sense disambiguation and discourse con-
nective variation, drawing evidence from examples
of explicit discourse connectives. Finally, Section 8
concludes this paper.
2 Overview of Chinese Discourse
Connectives
With our theoretical disposition, a discourse connec-
tive is viewed as a predicate taking two abstract ob-
jects such as propositions, events, or situations as
its arguments. A discourse connective can be ei-
ther explicit or implicit. An explicit discourse con-
nective is realized in the form of one lexical item
or several lexical items while an implicit discourse
connective must be inferred between adjacent dis-
course units. Typical explicit discourse connectives
are subordinate and coordinate conjunctions as well
as discourse adverbials. While the arguments for
subordinate and coordinate conjunctions are gener-
ally local, the first argument for a discourse adver-
bial may need to be identified long-distance in the
previous discourse.
2.1 Subordinate conjunctions
There are two types of subordinate conjunctions in
Chinese, single and paired. With single subordi-
nate conjunctions, the subordinate conjunction in-
troduces the subordinate clause, as in (1). By con-
vention, the subordinate clause is labeled ARG1 and
the main clause is labeled ARG2. The subordinate
conjunction is NOT included as part of the argu-
ment. The subordinate clause generally precedes the
main clause in Chinese, but occasionally it can also
follow the main clause. The assignment of the argu-
ment labels to the discourse units is independent of
their syntactic distributions. The subordinate clause
is always labeled ARG1 whether it precedes or fol-
lows the main clause.
Simple subordinate conjunctions: Simple sub-
ordinate conjunctions are very much like English
where the subordinate clause is introduced by a sub-
ordinate conjunction:

?The report believes that if the economic and financial
policies are effective, Asian economy is expected to re-
cover in 1999.?
Paired subordinate conjunctions: Chinese also
abounds in paired subordinate conjunctions, where
the subordinate conjunction introduces the subordi-
nate clause and another discourse connective intro-
duces the main clause, as in (2). In this case, the dis-
course connectives are considered to be paired and
jointly anchor ONE discourse relation.

?If the reform measures are not effective, confidence cri-

tion to other emerging markets.?

Modified discourse connectives: Like English,
some subordinate conjunctions can be modified by
an adverb, as illustrated in (3). Note that the subordi-
nate conjunction is in clause-medial position. When
this happens, the first argument, ARG1 in this case,
becomes discontinuous. Both portions of the argu-
ment, the one that comes before the subordinate con-
junction and the one after, are considered to be part
of the same argument.

?It is because its operations are standardized that the first
purchase service center for medical institutions in China
opened in the new district of Pudong in the beginning of
last year has not found a single case of kickback after
it has traded 100 million yuan worth of medicine in its
operation till now.?
Conjoined discourse connectives: The subordi-
nate conjunctions can be conjoined in Chinese so
that there are two subordinate clauses each having
one instance of the same subordinate conjunction.
In this case, there is still one discourse relation,
but ARG1 is the conjunction of the two subordinate
clauses. This is in contrast with English, where only
one subordinate conjunction is possible and ARG1
is linked with a coordinate conjunction, as illustrated
in the English translation.

?Although Huang Chunming has not published a novel

years from ?City Boys Missed Bus? to ?Ticket Box?,

themes have never changed.?
2.2 Coordinate conjunctions
The second type of explicit discourse connectives
we annotate are coordinate discourse conjunctions.
The arguments of coordinate conjunctions are anno-
tated in the order in which they appear. The argu-
ment that appears first is labeled ARG1 and the ar-
gument that appears next is marked ARG2. The co-
ordinate conjunctions themselves, like subordinate
conjunctions, are excluded from the arguments.

?In recent years, the medical expenses for diabetes pa-

medical expenses for diabetes patients in India is six hun-
dred and ten million dollars. China does not have concrete
statistics yet, but its diabetes population is increasing at a
pace of 750,000 new patients per year.
Paired coordinate conjunctions: Like subordi-
nate conjunctions, coordinate conjunctions can also
be paired, as in (6):

?The difficulty of being modern parents lies in the fact
they can not get rid of the traditional values flowing in
their blood, and they also need to face new values.?
2.3 Adverbial connectives
The third type of explicit discourse connectives we
annotate are discourse adverbials. A discourse ad-
verbial differs from other adverbs in that they require
an antecedent that is a proposition or a set of related
propositions. Generally, the second argument is ad-
jacent to the discourse adverbial while the first argu-
ment may be long-distance. By convention, the sec-
ond argument that is adjacent to the discourse con-
nective is labeled ARG2 and the other argument is
86
marked as ARG1. Note that in (7b) that first argu-
ment is not adjacent to the discourse adverbial.

?In the foreign enterprises that China approved of,

them. Among them processing projects are exces-
sively high. This is consistent with the current state
of affairs in China where the training and cost of the
labor force is low. Therefore they absorbed a large
portion of the labor force.?
2.4 Implicit discourse connectives
In addition to the explicit discourse connectives,
there are also implicit discourse connectives that
must be inferred from adjacent propositions. The
arguments for implicit discourse connectives are
marked in the order in which they occur, with the
argument that occurs first marked as ARG1 and the
other argument marked as ARG2. By convention
a punctuation mark is reserved as the place-holder
for the discourse connective. Where possible, the
annotator is asked to provide an explicit discourse
connective to characterize the type of discourse re-
lation. In (8), for example, a coordinate conjunction
?while? can be used in the place of the implicit
discourse connective.

?Among them, export is 17.83 billion, an 1.3 percent in-
crease over the same period last year. Meanwhile, import

3 Where are the discourse connectives?
In Chinese, discourse connectives are generally
clause-initial or clause-medial, although localizers
are clause-final and can be used as discourse con-
nective by themselves or together with a preposi-
tion. Subordinate conjunctions, coordinate conjunc-
tions and discourse adverbial can all occur in clause-
initial as well as clause-medial positions. The distri-
bution of the discourse connectives is not uniform,
and varies from discourse connective to discourse
connective. Some discourse connectives alternate
between clause-initial and clause-medial positions.
The examples in (9) show that ?+?even though?,
which forms a paired connective with ??but?,
occurs in both clause-initial (9a) and clause-medial
(9b) positions.

Localizers are a class of words that occur after
clauses or noun phrases to denote temporal or spatial
discourse relations. They can introduce a subordi-
nate clause by themselves or together with a preposi-
tion. While the preposition is optional, the localizer
is not. When both the preposition and the localizer
occur, they form a paired discourse connective an-
choring a discourse relation. Example (10) shows
the preposition and the localizer ?form a paired
discourse connective equivalent to the English sub-
ordinate conjunction ?when?.

4 What counts as an argument?
This section examines the syntactic composition of
arguments to discourse connectives in Chinese. Ar-
guments of discourse relations are propositional sit-
uations such as events, states, or properties. As such
an argument of a discourse relation can be realized
as a clause or multiple clauses, a sentence or mul-
tiple sentences. Typically, a subordinate conjunc-
tion introduces clauses that are arguments in a dis-
course relation. Discourse adverbials and coordinate
conjunctions, however, can take one or more sen-
tences to be their arguments. The examples in (11)
shows that arguments to discourse connectives can
be a single clause (11a), multiple clauses (11b), a
single sentence (11c) and multiple sentences (11d)
respectively.

5 Argument Scope
Determining the scope of an argument to a discourse
connective has proved to be the most challenging
part of the discourse annotation. A lot of the effort
goes into deciding when certain text units should be
included in or excluded from the argument of a dis-
course connective. Under our annotation scheme,
the prepositional phrases, which generally precede
the subject in a Chinese clause, are included in the
argument of a discourse connective, as illustrated in
(12a). The material in the main clause that embeds
a discourse relation, however, are excluded, as in
(12b).

A lot of the challenge in determining the scope of
an argument stems from the fact that discourse struc-
tures are recursive. As such identifying the scope of
an argument is effectively determining how the dis-
course relations are hierarchically organized. This
is illustrated in (13), where the discourse relation
anchored by the coordinate conjunction ?but? is
embedded within the discourse relation anchored by
the subordinate conjunction XJ?if?. The ambigu-
ity is whether the conditional clause introduced by
?XJ? has scope over one or two of the clauses co-
ordinated by?but?.

?The report believes that if the economic and financial
policies are effective, the economy of Asia is expected
to recover, but there will not be a V-shaped high-speed
recovery like the one after the financial crisis of Mexico
and Argentina in 1994 and 1995.?
Given our bottom-up approach in which discourse
connectives anchor binary discourse relations, we
do not explicitly annotate hierarchical structures be-
tween the arguments. However, such discourse re-
lations can be deduced when some discourse rela-
tions are recursively embedded within another as ar-
guments to another discourse connective.

6 Sense Disambiguation
Although discourse connectives are often consid-
ered to be a closed set, some lexical items in Chi-
nese can be used as both a discourse connective and
a non-discourse connective. In this case it is im-
portant to tease them part. There are also discourse
connectives that have different senses, and it is po-
tentially beneficial for certain NLP applications to
disambiguate these senses. Machine Translation, for
example, would need to translate the different senses
into different discourse connectives in the target lan-
guage. The examples in (14) shows the different
senses of , which can be translated into ?while?
(14a), ?but? (14c), ?and? (14d) and ?instead? (14e).
Note that in (14e) it is important for the first argu-
ment to be negated by ??not?. In (14b), however,
it is not a discourse connective. It does not seem to
contribute any meaning to the sentence and is prob-
ably just there to satisfy some prosodic constraint.

7 Discourse Connective Variation
The flip side of sense disambiguation is that one dis-
course relation is often realized with different dis-
course connectives due to the long evolution of the
Chinese language and morphological processes like
suoxie, which is one form of abbreviation. The
examples in (15) shows the different variations of
the discourse relation of concession. The different
forms of the discourse connective are so similar that
they can hardly be considered to be different dis-
course connectives. In principle, any combination
of part 1 and part 2 from Table 7 can form a paired
discourse connective, subject to some non-discourse
related constraints. In (15a), for example, the abbre-
viated ?can only occur in clause-medial positions.
(15b) shows the second part of the paired discourse
connective can be dropped without changing the se-
mantics of the discourse relation. (15c) shows that
the second part of the paired discourse connective
can be combined with another discourse connective.

8 Conclusion
We examined the range of discourse connective we
plan to annotate for the Chinese Discourse Treebank
project. We have shown that while arguments to sub-
ordinate and coordinate conjunctions can be identi-
fied locally, arguments to discourse adverbials may
be long-distance. We also examined the distribution
of the discourse connectives in Chinese and the syn-
tactic composition and the scope of the arguments in
discourse relations. We have shown the most chal-
lenging issue in discourse annotation is determin-
ing the text span of a discourse argument and this
is partly due to the hierarchical nature of discourse
structures. We have discussed the need to address
sense disambiguation and discourse connective vari-
ation in our annotation of Chinese discourse connec-
tives.
