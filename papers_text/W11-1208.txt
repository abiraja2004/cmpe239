Abstract
We present a novel paraphrase fragment pair
extraction method that uses a monolingual
comparable corpus containing different arti-
cles about the same topics or events. The pro-
cedure consists of document pair extraction,
sentence pair extraction, and fragment pair ex-
traction. At each stage, we evaluate the in-
termediate results manually, and tune the later
stages accordingly. With this minimally su-
pervised approach, we achieve 62% of accu-
racy on the paraphrase fragment pairs we col-
lected and 67% extracted from the MSR cor-
pus. The results look promising, given the
minimal supervision of the approach, which
can be further scaled up.
1 Introduction
Paraphrase is an important linguistic phenomenon
which occurs widely in human languages. Since
paraphrases capture the variations of linguistic ex-
pressions while preserving the meaning, they are
very useful in many applications, such as machine
translation (Marton et al, 2009), document summa-
rization (Barzilay et al, 1999), and recognizing tex-
tual entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al, 2005).
However, such resources are not trivial to ob-
tain. If we make a comparison between para-
phrase and MT, the latter has large parallel bilin-
gual/multilingual corpora to acquire translation pairs
in different granularity; while it is difficult to find a
?naturally? occurred paraphrase ?parallel? corpora.
Furthermore, in MT, certain words can be translated
into a (rather) small set of candidate words in the
target language; while in principle, each paraphrase
can have infinite number of ?target? expressions,
which reflects the variety of each human language.
A variety of paraphrase extraction approaches
have been proposed recently, and they require dif-
ferent types of training data. Some require bilingual
parallel corpora (Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al,
2008), others require monolingual parallel corpora
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Ibrahim et al, 2003)
or monolingual comparable corpora (Dolan et al,
2004).
In this paper, we focus on extracting paraphrase
fragments from monolingual corpora, because this is
the most abundant source of data. Additionally, this
would potentially allow us to extract paraphrases for
a variety of languages that have monolingual cor-
pora, but which do not have easily accessible paral-
lel corpora.
This paper makes the following contributions:
1. We adapt a translation fragment pair extrac-
tion method to paraphrase extraction, i.e., from
bilingual corpora to monolingual corpora.
2. We construct a large collection of para-
phrase fragments from monolingual compara-
ble corpora and achieve similar quality from a
manually-checked paraphrase corpus.
3. We evaluate both intermediate and final results
of the paraphrase collection, using the crowd-
sourcing technique, which is effective, fast, and
cheap.

2 Related Work
Roughly speaking, there are three dimensions to
characterize the previous work in paraphrase ac-
quisition and machine translation, whether the
data comes from monolingual or bilingual corpora,
whether the corpora are parallel or comparable, and
whether the output is at the sentence level or at the
sub-sentential level. Table 1 gives one example in
each category.
Paraphrase acquisition is mostly done at the
sentence-level, e.g., (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001;
Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al, 2004), which is
not straightforward to be used as a resource for other
NLP applications. Quirk et al (2004) adopted the
MT approach to ?translate? one sentence into a para-
phrased one. As for the corpora, Barzilay and McK-
eown (2001) took different English translations of
the same novels (i.e., monolingual parallel corpora),
while the others experimented on multiple sources
of the same news/events, i.e., monolingual compa-
rable corpora.
At the sub-sentential level, interchangeable pat-
terns (Shinyama et al, 2002; Shinyama and Sekine,
2003) or inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001)
are extracted, which are quite successful in named-
entity-centered tasks, like information extraction,
while they are not generalized enough to be applied
to other tasks or they have a rather small coverage,
e.g. RTE (Dinu and Wang, 2009). To our best
knowledge, there is few focused study on general
paraphrase fragments extraction at the sub-sentential
level, from comparable corpora. A recent study
by Belz and Kow (2010) mainly aimed at natural
language generation, which they performed a small
scale experiment on a specific topic, i.e., British
hills.
Given the available parallel corpora from the MT
community, there are studies focusing on extracting
paraphrases from bilingual corpora (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao
et al, 2008). The way they do is to treat one lan-
guage as an pivot and equate two phrases in the other
languages as paraphrases if they share a common
pivot phrase. Paraphrase extraction draws on phrase
pair extraction from the translation literature. Since
parallel corpora have many alternative ways of ex-
pressing the same foreign language concept, large
quantities of paraphrase pairs can be extracted.
As for the MT research, the standard statistical
MT systems require large size of parallel corpora for
training and then extract sub-sentential translation
phrases. Apart from the limited parallel corpora,
comparable corpora are non-parallel bilingual cor-
pora whose documents convey the similar informa-
tion are also widely considered by many researchers,
e.g., (Fung and Lo, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2000;
Vogel, 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004a; Fung and
Cheung, 2004b; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Wu
and Fung, 2005). A recent study by Smith et al
(2010) extracted parallel sentences from comparable
corpora to extend the existing resources.
At the sub-sentential level, Munteanu and
Marcu (2006) extracted sub-sentential translation
pairs from comparable corpora based on the log-
likelihood-ratio of word translation probability.
They exploit the possibility of making use of reports
within a limited time window, which are about the
same event or having overlapping contents, but in
different languages. Quirk et al (2007) extracted
fragments using a generative model of noisy transla-
tions. They show that even in non-parallel corpora,
useful parallel words or phrases can still be found
and the size of such data is much larger than that of

Figure 1: A three stage pipeline is used to extract paraphrases from monolingual texts
parallel corpora. In this paper, we adapt ideas from
the MT research on extracting sub-sentential trans-
lation fragments from bilingual comparable corpora
(Munteanu and Marcu, 2006), and use the tech-
niques to extract paraphrases from monolingual par-
allel and comparable corpora.
Evaluation is another challenge for resource col-
lection, which usually requires tremendous labor re-
sources. Both Munteanu and Marcu (2006) and
Quirk et al (2007) evaluated their resources indi-
rectly in MT systems, while in this paper, we make
use of the crowd-sourcing technique to manually
evaluate the quality of the paraphrase collection.
In parcitular, Amazon?s Mechanical Turk1 (MTurk)
provides a way to pay people small amounts of
money to perform tasks that are simple for humans
but difficult for computers. Examples of these Hu-
man Intelligence Tasks (or HITs) range from label-
ing images to moderating blog comments to pro-
viding feedback on relevance of results for a search
query. Using MTurk for NLP task evaluation has
been shown to be significantly cheaper and faster,
and there is a high agreement between aggregate
non-expert annotations and gold-standard annota-
tions provided by the experts (Snow et al, 2008).

3 Fragment Pair Acquisition
Figure 1 shows the pipeline of our paraphrase ac-
quisition method. We evaluate quality at each stage
using Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. In order to en-
sure that the non-expert annotators complete the task
accurately, we used both positive and negative con-
trols. If annotators answered either control incor-
rectly, we excluded their answers. For all the ex-
periments we describe in this paper, we obtain the
answers within a couple of hours or an overnight.
Our focus in this paper is on fragment extraction,
but we briefly describe document and sentence pair
extraction first.
3.1 Document Pair Extraction
Monolingual comparable corpora contain texts
about the same events or subjects, written in one lan-
guage by different authors (Barzilay and Elhadad,
2003). We extract pairs of newswire articles written
by different news agencies from the GIGAWORD cor-
pus, which contains articles from six different agen-
cies. Although the comparable documents are not in
parallel, at the sentential or sub-sentential level, the
paraphrased fragments may still exist.
To quantify the comparability between two doc-
uments, we calculate the number of overlapping
words and give them different weights based on
TF-IDF (Salton and McGill, 1983) using the More-
54
LikeThis2 function provided by Lucene.
After collecting the document pairs, we asked an-
notators, ?Are these two documents about the same
topic??, and allowing them to answer ?Yes?, ?No?,
and ?Not sure?. Each set of six document pairs con-
tained, four to be evaluated, one positive control (a
pair of identical documents) and one negative con-
trol (a pair of random documents). We sampled
400 document pairs with the comparability score be-
tween 0.8 and 0.9, and another 400 pairs greater than
0.9. We presented them in a random order and each
was labeled by three annotations. After excluding
the annotations containing incorrect answers for ei-
ther control, we took a majority vote for every docu-
ment pair, and if three annotations are different from
each other.
We found document pairs with >0.9 were classi-
fied by annotators to be related more than half the
time, and a higher threshold would greatly decrease
the number of document pairs extracted. We per-
formed subsequent steps on the 3896 document pairs
that belonged to this category.
3.2 Sentence Pair Extraction
After extracting pairs of related documents, we
next selected pairs of related sentences from within
paired documents. The motivation behind is that
the standard word alignment algorithms can be eas-
ily applied to the paired sentences instead of docu-
ments. To do so we selected sentences with overlap-
ping n-grams up to length n=4. Obviously for para-
phrasing, we want some of the n-grams to differ, so
we varied the amount of overlap and evaluated sen-
tence pairs with a variety of threshold bands3.
We evaluated 10 pairs of sentences at a time, in-
cluding one positive control and two negative con-
trols. A random pair of sentential paraphrases from
the RTE task acted as the positive control. The
negative controls included one random pair of non-
paraphrased, but highly relevant sentences, and a
random pair of sentences. Annotators classified the
sentence pairs as: paraphrases, related sentences,

parability and minimum comparability) for the 4 groups are,
{0.78,0.206}, {0.206,0.138}, {0.138,0.115}, {0.115,0.1}.

and non-related sentences.
We uniformly sampled 200 sentence pairs from
each band. They are randomly shuffled into more
than 100 HITs and each HIT got three annotations.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of annotations across
different groups, after excluding answers that failed
the controls.
Our best scoring threshold band was 0.2-0.8. Sen-
tence pairs with this overlap were judged to be para-
phrases 45% of the time, to be related 30% of the
time, and to be unrelated 25% of the time. Although
the F2 heuristic proposed by Dolan et al (2004),
which takes the first two sentences of each document
pair, obtains higher relatedness score (we evalu-
ated F2 sentences as 50% paraphrases, 37% related,
and 13% unrelated), our n-gram overlap method ex-
tracted much more sentence pairs per document pair.
One interesting observation other than the general
increasing tendency is that the portion of the related
sentence pairs is not monotonic, which exactly re-
flects our intuition about a good comparability value
(neither too high nor too low). However, some er-
rors are difficult to exclude. For instance, one sen-
tence says ?The airstrikes were halted for 72 hours
last Thursday...? and the other says ?NATO and UN
officials extended the suspension of airstrikes for a
further 72 hours from late Sunday...?. Without fine-
grained analysis of the temporal expressions, it is
difficult to know whether they are talking about the
same event. The F2 method does provide us a fairly
good way to exclude some unrelated sentence pairs,
but note that the pairs collected by this method are

only about 0.5% of using the comparability scores.
We show in Figure 1 that we also use an addi-
tional sentence-level paraphrase corpus as the input
of this module. We take all the positive instances
(i.e. the two sentences in a pair are paraphrase to
each other) and pass them to the later stage as well,
as for comparison with our paraphrase collection ex-
tracted from the comparable sentence pairs. In all,
we used 276,120 sentence pairs to feed our fragment
extraction method.
3.3 Fragment Pair Extraction
The basic procedure is to 1) establish alignments be-
tween words or n-grams and 2) extract target para-
phrase fragments. For the first step, we use two ap-
proaches. One is to change the common substring
alignment problem from string to word sequence
and we extend the longest common substring (LCS)
extraction algorithm to multiple common n-grams.
An alternative way is to use a normal word aligner
(widely used as the first step in MT systems) to ac-
complish the job. For our experiments, we use the
BerkeleyAligner4 (Liang et al, 2006) by feeding it a
dictionary of pairs of identical words along with the
paired sentences. We can also combine these two
methods by performing the LCS alignment first and
adding additional word alignments from the aligner.
These form the three configurations of our system
(Table 2).
Following Munteanu and Marcu (2006), we use
both positive and negative lexical associations for
the alignment. The positive association measures
4http://code.google.com/p/
berkeleyaligner/
how likely one word will be aligned to another
(value from 0 to 1); and the negative associations
indicates how unlikely an alignment exists between
a word pair (from -1 to 0). The basic idea to have
both is that when a word cannot be aligned with any
other words, it will choose the least unlikely one. If
the positive association of w1 being aligned with w2
is defined as the conditional probability p(w1|w2),
the negative associations will simply be p(w1|?w2).
Since we obtain a distribution of all the possible
words aligned with w1 from the word aligner, both
p(w1|w2) and p(w1|?w2) can be calculated; for the
LCS alignment, we simply set p(w1|w2) as 1 and
p(w1|?w2) as -1, if w1 and w2 are aligned; and vice
versa, if not.
After the initialization of all the word alignments
using the two associations, each word takes the av-
erage of the neighboring four words and itself. The
intuition of this smoothing is to tolerate a few un-
aligned parts (if they are surrounded by aligned
parts). Finally, all the word alignments having a pos-
itive score will be selected as the candidate fragment
elements. Figure 3 shows an example of this pro-
cess.
The second step, fragment extraction, is a bit
tricky, since a fragment is not clearly defined like
a document or a sentence. One option is to fol-
low the MT definition of a phrase, which means a
sub-sentential n-gram string (usually n is less than
10). Munteanu and Marcu (2006) adopted this, and
considered all the possible sub-sentential translation
fragments as their targets, i.e. the adjacent n-grams.
For instance, in Figure 3, all the adjacent words
above the threshold (i.e. zero) will form the target

phrase extraction. The first column serves as the baseline.
paraphrase, ?the Bosnian Serbs to pull their heavy
weapons back from? and those aligned words in the
other sentence ?the Bosnian Serbs withdraw their
heavy weapons from? will be the source paraphrase.
The disadvantage of this definition is that the ex-
tracted fragment pairs might not be easy for human
beings to interpret or they are even ungrammatical
(cf. the fourth example in Table 5). An alternative
way is to follow the linguistic definition of a phrase,
e.g. noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc. In this
case, we need to use (at least) a chunker to prepro-
cess the text and obtain the proper boundary of each
fragment and we used the OpenNLP chunker.
We finalize our paraphrase collection by filter-
ing out identical fragment pairs, subsumed fragment
pairs (one fragment is fully contained in the other),
and fragment having only one word. Apart from sen-
tence pairs collected from the comparable corpora,
we also did experiments on the existing MSR para-
phrase corpus (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which is
a collection of manually annotated sentential para-
phrases.
The evaluation on both collections is done by the
MTurk. Each task contains 8 pairs of fragments to
be evaluated, plus one positive control using iden-
tical fragment pairs, and one negative control using
a pair of random fragments. All the fragments are
shown with the corresponding sentences from where
they are extracted5. The question being asked is
5We thought about evaluating pairs of isolated fragments,
?How are the two highlighted phrases related??, and
the possible answers are, ?These phrases refer to the
same thing as each other? (PARAPHRASE), ?These
phrases are overlap but contain different informa-
tion? (RELATED), and ?The phrases are unrelated or
invalid? (INVALID). Table 2 shows the results (ex-
cluding invalid sentence pairs) and Table 5 shows
some examples.
In general, the results on MSR is better than those
on our corpus6. Comparing the different settings,
for our corpus, word alignment with n-gram frag-
ment extraction works better; and for corpora with
higher comparability (e.g. the MSR corpus), the
configuration of using both LCS and word align-
ments and the chunk-based fragment extraction out-
performs the others. In fact, PARAPHRASE and RE-
LATED are not quite comparable7, since the bound-
ary mismatch of the fragments may not be obvious
to the Turkers. Nevertheless, we would assume a
cleaner output from the chunk-based method, and
both approaches achieve similar levels of quality.
Zhao et al (2008) extracted paraphrase frag-
ment pairs from bilingual parallel corpora, and
their log-liner model outperforms Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005)?s maximum likelihood esti-
mation method with 67% to 60%. Notice that, our
starting corpora are (noisy) comparable corpora in-
stead of parallel ones (for our corpus), and the ap-
proach is almost unsupervised8, so that it can be
easily scaled up to other larger corpora, e.g. the
news websites. Furthermore, we compared our frag-
ment pair collection with Callison-Burch (2008)?s
approach on the same MSR corpus, only about 21%
of the extracted paraphrases appear on both sides,
which shows the potential to combine different re-
sources.

ment pair collection. We show the basic statistics of
the corpora and then some examples of the output.

for parameter tuning instead of training the system
57
As for comparison, we choose two other paraphrase
collections, one is acquired from parallel bilingual
corpora (Callison-Burch, 2008) and the other is us-
ing the same fragment extraction algorithm on the
MSR corpus.

Document Pairs Selected 10,000 0.25%

Table 3: The size of our corpus. We only used ca. 10%
of the GIGAWORD corpus in the experiments and the size
of the collection at each stage are shown in the table.
Table 3 roughly shows the percentage of the ex-
tracted data compared with the original GIGAWORD
corpus at each stage9. In the experiments reported
here, we only use a subset of the news articles in
1995. If we scale to the full GIGAWORD corpus (19
Gigabytes, news from 1994 to 2006), we expect an
order of magnitude more fragment pairs to be col-
lected.
Apart from the size of the corpus, we are also in-
terested in the composition of the corpus. Table 4
shows the proportions of some n-grams contained in
the corpus. Here CCB denotes the paraphrase col-
lection acquired from parallel bilingual corpora re-
ported in (Callison-Burch, 2008), and MSR? denotes
the collection using the same algorithm on the MSR
corpus.
In Table 4, the four columns from the left are
about the fragments (one part of each fragment pair),
and the six columns from the right are about para-
phrases. For example, 1 & 2 indicates the paraphrase
contains one single word on one side and a 2-gram
on the other side. Since we deliberately exclude sin-
gle words, the n-gram distributions of OUR and MSR
are ?flatter? than the other two corpora, but still, 2-
grams fragments occupy more than 40% in all cases.
The n-gram distributions of the paraphrases are even
more diverse for the OUR and MSR corpora. The sum
9All the numbers in the table are roughly estimated, due to
the variations of different settings. This just gives us an impres-
sion of the space for improvement.
of the listed proportions are only around 45%, while
for CCB and MSR?, the sums are about 95%.
4.2 Examples
Table 5 shows some examples from the best two set-
tings. From our corpus, both simple paraphrases
(?Governor ... said? and ?Gov. ... announced?)
and more varied ones (?rose to fame as? and ?the
highlight of his career?) can be extracted. It?s clear
that the smoothing and extraction algorithms do help
with finding non-trivial paraphrases (shown in Fig-
ure 3). The extracted phrase ?campaign was? shows
the disadvantage of n-gram-based phrase extraction
method, since the boundary of the fragment could be
improper. Using a chunker can effectively exclude
such problems, as shown in the lower part of the ta-
ble, where all the extracted paraphrases are gram-
matical phrases. Even from a parallel paraphrase
corpus at the sentence level, the acquired fragment
pairs (w/o context) could be non-paraphrases. For
instance, the second pair from the MSR corpus shows
that one news agency gives more detailed informa-
tion about the launching site than the other, and the
last example is also debatable, whether it?s ?under
$200? or ?around $200? depending on the reliability
of the information source.
5 Summary and Future Work
In this paper, we present our work on paraphrase
fragment pair extraction from monolingual compa-
rable corpora, inspired by Munteanu and Marcu
(2006)?s bilingual method. We evaluate our inter-
mediate results at each of the stages using MTurk.
Both the quality and the quantity of the collected
paraphrase fragment pairs are promising given the
minimal supervision. As for the ongoing work, we
are currently expanding our extraction process to the
whole GIGAWORD corpus, and we plan to apply it
to other comparable corpora as well. For the fu-
ture work, we consider incorporating more linguistic
constraints, e.g. using a syntactic parser (Callison-
Burch, 2008), to further improve the quality of the
collection. More importantly, applying the collected
paraphrase fragment pairs to other NLP applications
(e.g. MT, RTE, etc.) will give us a better view of the
utility of this resource.
