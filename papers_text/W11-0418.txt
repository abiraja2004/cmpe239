Abstract 
This paper presents the annotation 
guidelines and specifications which have 
been developed for the creation of the 
Italian TimeBank, a language resource 
composed of two corpora manually 
annotated with temporal and event 
information. In particular, the adaptation 
of the TimeML scheme to Italian is 
described, and a special attention is 
given to the methodology used for the 
realization of the annotation 
specifications, which are strategic in 
order to create good quality annotated 
resources and to justify the annotated 
items. The reliability of the It-TimeML 
guidelines and specifications is 
evaluated on the basis of the results of 
the inter-coder agreement performed 
during the annotation of the two corpora. 
? Introduction 
In recent years a renewed interest in temporal 
processing has spread in the NLP community, 
thanks to the success of the TimeML annotation 
scheme (Pustejovsky et al, 2003a) and to the 
availability of annotated resources, such as the 
English and French TimeBanks (Pustejovsky et 
al., 2003b; Bittar, 2010) and the TempEval 
corpora (Verhagen et al, 2010). 
The ISO TC 37 / SC 4 initiative 
(?Terminology and other language and content 
resources?) and the TempEval-2 contest have 
contributed to the development of TimeML-
compliant annotation schemes in languages 
other than English, namely Spanish, Korean, 
Chinese, French and Italian. Once the 
corresponding corpora will be completed and 
made available, the NLP community will benefit 
from having access to different language 
resources with a common layer of annotation 
which could boost studies in multilingual 
temporal processing and improve the 
performance of complex multilingual NLP 
systems, such as Question-Answering and 
Textual Entailment. 
This paper focuses on the annotation 
guidelines and specifications which have been 
developed for the creation of the Italian 
TimeBank (hereafter, Ita-TimeBank). The 
distinction between annotation guidelines and 
annotation specifications is of utmost 
importance in order to distinguish between the 
abstract, formal definition of an annotation 
scheme and the actual realization of the 
annotated language resource. In addition to this, 
documenting the annotation specification 
facilitates the reduplication of annotations and 
justify the annotated items. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
will describe in detail specific issues related to 
the temporal annotation of Italian for the two 
main tags of the TimeML annotation scheme, 
143
namely <EVENT> and <TIMEX3>. Section 3 
will present the realization of the annotation 
specifications and will document them. Section 
4 focuses on the evaluation of the annotation 
scheme on the Ita-TimeBank, formed by two 
corpora independently realized by applying the 
annotation specifications. Finally, in Section 5 
conclusions and extensions to the current 
annotation effort will be reported. 
Notice that, for clarity's sake, in this paper the 
examples will focus only on the tag (or attribute 
or link) under discussion. 
? It-TimeML: Extensions and 
Language Specific Issues 
Applying an annotation scheme to a language 
other than the one for which it was initially 
developed, requires a careful study of the 
language specific issues related to the linguistic 
phenomena taken into account (Im et al, 2009; 
Bittar, 2008). 
TimeML focuses on Events (i.e. actions, 
states, and processes - <EVENT> tag), 
Temporal Expressions (i.e. durations, calendar 
dates, times of day and sets of time - 
<TIMEX3> tag), Signals (e.g. temporal 
prepositions and subordinators - <SIGNAL> 
tag) and various kind of dependencies between 
Events and/or Temporal Expressions (i.e. 
temporal, aspectual and subordination relations - 
<TLINK>, <ALINK> and <SLINK> tags 
respectively). 
An ISO language-independent specification 
of TimeML is under development but it is still 
in the enquiry stage1. For this reason, in the 
following subsections we will mostly compare 
the Italian annotation guidelines with the latest 
version of the English annotation guidelines 
(TimeML Working group, 2010), focusing on 
the two main tags, i.e <EVENT> and 
<TIMEX3>, in Italian. 
2.1 The <EVENT> tag 
The <EVENT> tag is used to mark-up instances 
of eventualities (Bach, 1986). This category 
comprises all types of actions (punctual or 
durative) and states as well. With respect to

ue_detail.htm?csnumber=37331 
previous annotations schemes (Katz and Arosio, 
2001, Filatova and Hovy, 2001, Setzer and 
Gaizauskas, 2001 among other), TimeML 
allows for annotating as Events not only verbs 
but also nouns, adjectives and prepositional 
phrases. 
In the adaptation to Italian, two annotation 
principles adopted for English, that is an 
orientation towards surface linguistic 
phenomena and the notion of minimal chunk for 
the tag extent, have been preserved without 
major modifications. The main differences with 
respect to the English version rely i.) in the 
attribute list; and ii.) in the attributes values. 
In Italian 12 core attributes apply with respect 
to the 10 attributes in English. The newly 
introduced attributes are MOOD and VFORM 
which capture key distinctions of the Tense-
Mood-Aspect (TMA) system of the Italian 
language. These two attributes are common to 
other languages, such as Spanish, Catalan, 
French and Korean. 
The MOOD attribute captures the contrastive 
grammatical expression of different modalities 
of presentation of an Event when realized by a 
verb. Annotating this attribute is important since 
grammatical modality has an impact on the 
identification of temporal and subordinating 
relations, and on the assessment of 
veridicity/factivity values. Mood in Italian is 
expressed as part of the verb morphology and 
not by means of modal auxiliary verbs as in 
English (e.g. through the auxiliary ?would?),. 
Thus, the solution to deal with this phenomenon 
adopted for English TimeML (where the main 
verb is annotated with the attribute 
MODALITY=?would?, see below) is not 
applicable in Italian unless relevant information 
is lost. The values of the MOOD attribute, as 
listed below, have been adapted to Italian and 
extended with respect to those proposed in the 
ISO-TimeML specification: 
 
? NONE: it is used as the default value and 
corresponds to the Indicative mood: 
(1.) Le forze dell?ordine hanno <EVENT 
? mood="NONE"> schierato </EVENT> 
3.000 agenti. [The police has deployed 
3,000 agents.] 
 
144
? CONDITIONAL: it signals the conditional 
mood which is used to speak of an Event 
whose realization is dependent on a certain 
condition, or to signal the future-in-the-
past: 
(2.) <EVENT ... mood="COND"> 
Mangerei </EVENT> del pesce. [I would 
eat fish.] 
  
? SUBJUNCTIVE: it has several uses in 
independent clauses and is required for 
certain types of dependent clauses. 
(3.) Voglio che tu te ne <EVENT ? 
mood="SUBJUNCTIVE">vada</EVENT> 
[I want you to go.] 
  
? IMPERATIVE: it is used to express direct 
commands or requests, to signal a 
prohibition, permission or any other kind of 
exhortation. 
 
The attribute VFORM is responsible for 
distinguishing between non-finite and finite 
forms of verbal Events. Its values are: 
 
? NONE: it is the default value and signals 
finite verb forms: 
(4.) Le forze dell?ordine hanno <EVENT 
? vForm="NONE">schierato</EVENT> 
3.000 agenti. [The police has deployed 
3,000 agents.] 
 
? INFINITIVE: for infinitive verb forms: 
(5.) Non ? possibile <EVENT ? 
vForm=''INFINITIVE''>viaggiare</EVEN
T>. [It?s not possible to travel.] 
 
? GERUND: for gerundive verb forms: 
(6.) Ha evitato l'incidente <EVENT ? 
vForm=''GERUND''> andando </EVENT> 
piano. [Driving slowly, he avoided the 
incident.] 
 
? PARTICIPLE: for participle verb forms: 
(7.) <EVENT ? vForm=?PARTICIPLE?> 
Vista </EVENT> Maria, se ne and?. 
[Having seen Maria, he left.] 
 
As for attribute values, the most important 
changes introduced for Italian in comparison 
with the English TimeML, are related to the 
ASPECT and MODALITY attributes. 
The ASPECT attribute captures standard 
distinctions in the grammatical category of 
aspect or Event viewpoint (Smith, 1991). In 
English TimeML it has the following values: i.) 
PROGRESSIVE; ii.) PERFECTIVE; iii.) 
PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE, or iv.) NONE. 
The main differences with respect to the English 
guidelines concern the following points:  
i.) the absence of the value 
PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE and  
ii.) the presence of the value 
IMPERFECTIVE, which is part of the ISO 
TimeML current definition.  
These differences are due to language specific 
phenomena related to the expression of the 
grammatical aspect in Italian and English and to 
the application of the TimeML surface oriented 
annotation philosophy. In particular, the 
assignment of the aspectual values is strictly 
determined by the verb surface forms. For 
instance, in English the verb form ?is teaching? 
requires the PROGRESSIVE value. On the 
other hand, the Italian counterpart of ?is 
teaching? can be realized in two ways: either by 
means of the simple present (insegna [s/he 
teaches]) or by means of a specific verbal 
periphrasis (sta insegnando [s/he is teaching]). 
In order to distinguish between these two verb 
forms, and to account also for other typical 
Romance languages tense forms, such as the 
Italian Imperfetto, the use of the additional 
IMPERFECTIVE value is necessary. Thus, 
insegna [s/he teaches], as well as the Imperfetto 
insegnava [s/he was teaching] are annotated as 
IMPERFECTIVE, whereas sta insegnando [s/he 
is teaching] is annotated as PROGRESSIVE. On 
the other hand, the absence of the 
PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE value, used for 
English tense forms of the kind ?he has been 
teaching?, is due to the lack of Italian verb 
surface forms which may require its use. 
In English, modal verbs are not annotated as 
Events and the MODALITY attribute is 
associated to the main verb (the value of the 
attribute is the token corresponding to the modal 
verb). Unlike English modals, Italian modal 
verbs, such as potere [can/could; may/might], 
volere [want; will/would] and dovere 
[must/have to; ought to; shall/should], are to be 
145
considered similar to other lexical verbs in that 
it is possible to assign them values for tense and 
aspect. Consequently, each instance of Italian 
modal verbs will be annotated with the tag 
<EVENT>. The value of the MODALITY 
attribute is the lemma of the verb (e.g. dovere). 
A further language specific aspect concerns 
the annotation of verbal periphrases, that is 
special constructions with at least two verbs 
(and sometimes other words) that behave as a 
group like a single verb would. In Italian, it is 
possible to identify different instances of verbal 
periphrases, namely: 
 
? aspectual periphrases (example 8 below), 
which encode progressive or habitual 
aspect; 
? modal periphrases (example 9), which 
encode modality not realized by proper 
modal verbs;  
? phasal periphrases (example 10), which 
encode information on a particular phase in 
the description of an Event. 
 
Following Bertinetto (1991), in the last two 
cases, i.e. modal periphrases and phasal 
periphrases, both verbal elements involved 
should be annotated, while in the case of the 
aspectual periphrasis only the main verb (verb 
head) has to be marked; e.g.: 
(8.) Maria stava <EVENT ? 
ASPECT=?PROGRESSIVE?> mangiando. 
[Maria was eating] 
(9.) Il compito di matematica <EVENT ... 
MODALITY=?ANDARE?> va </EVENT> 
<EVENT ... > svolto </EVENT> per domani. 
[Maths exercises must be done for tomorrow]  
(10.) I contestatori hanno <EVENT ... 
CLASS=?ASPECTUAL?> iniziato </EVENT> 
a <EVENT> lanciare </EVENT> pietre. 
[Demonstrators started to throw stones.] 
Similarly to what proposed for English, in 
presence of multi-tokens realization of Events, 
two main annotation strategies have been 
followed: 
 
? in case the multi-token Event expression 
corresponds to an instance of a collocation 
or of an idiomatic expression, then only the 
head (verbal, nominal or other) of the 
expression is marked up;  
? in case the multi-token Event is realized by 
light verb expressions, then two separate 
<EVENT> tags are to be created both for 
the verb and the nominal/prepositional 
complement.  
2.2 The <TIMEX3> tag  
The TIMEX3 tag relies on and is as much 
compliant as possible with the TIDES TIMEX2 
annotation. The Italian adaptation of this 
annotation scheme is presented in Magnini et al 
(2006). The only difference concerns the 
annotation of articulated prepositions which are 
annotated as signals, while in the TIMEX2 
specifications they are considered as part of the 
textual realization of Temporal Expressions: 
(11a.) <TIMEX2 ?> nel 2011 </TIMEX2> 
[in 2011] 
(11b.) <SIGNAL ?> nel </SIGNAL> 
<TIMEX3?>2011</TIMEX3> [in 2011] 
On the other hand, with respect to the 
TIMEX3 annotation of other languages such as 
English, we decided to follow the TIMEX2 
specification by annotating many adjectives as 
Temporal Expressions (e.g. recente [recent], ex 
[former]) and including modifiers like che 
rimane in l?anno che rimane [the remaining 
year] into the extent of the TIMEX3 tag since it 
is essential for the normalization of temporal 
expressions. 
3 From Annotation Guidelines to 
Specifications ?
As already stated, the annotation guidelines 
represent an abstract, formal level of description 
which, in this case, is mainly based on a detailed 
study of the relevant linguistic levels. Once the 
guidelines are applied to real language data, 
further issues arise and need to be tackled. This 
section focuses on a method for developing 
annotation specifications. Annotation 
specifications are to be seen as the actual 
realization of the annotation guidelines. The 
identification and distinction of annotation 
guidelines from annotation specification is of 
major importance as it is to be conceived as a 
new level of Best Practice for the creation of 
146
semantically annotated Language Resources 
(Calzolari and Caselli, 2009). 
The process of realization of the annotation 
specifications is strategic both to realize good 
quality annotated resources and to justify why 
certain textual items have to be annotated. As 
for the It-TimeML experience we will illustrate 
this process by making reference and reporting 
examples for two tags, namely for the 
<EVENT> and the <TLINK> tags. 
As a general procedure for the development 
of the annotation specifications, we have taken 
inspiration from the DAMSL Manual (Core and 
Allen, 1997). Different decision trees have been 
created for each task. For instance, for the 
annotation of the <EVENT> tag, four different 
decision trees have been designed for each POS 
(i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositional 
phrases) which could be involved in the 
realization of an Event. In particular, the most 
complex decision tree is that developed for noun 
annotation. The identification of the eventive 
reading of nouns has been formalized into a 
discrimination process of different properties: 
firstly superficial properties are taken into 
consideration, i.e. whether a morphologically 
related verb exists or not, and whether the noun 
co-occurs with special verb predicates (for 
instance aspectual verbs such as iniziare [to 
start] or light verbs such as fare [to do]); then, 
deeper semantic properties are analyzed, which 
involve other levels such as word sense 
disambiguation and noun classification (e.g. 
whether the noun is a functional or an 
incremental one). 
Other decision trees have been improved to 
avoid inconsistencies in Event classification. 
For instance, the identification of Reporting 
Events showed to be problematic because of the 
vague definition adopted in the guidelines. A 
Reporting Event is a giving information speech 
act in which a communicator conveys a message 
to an addressee. To help annotators in deciding 
whether an event is a Reporting one, the 
annotation specifications suggest to rely on 
FrameNet as a starting point (Baker, et al 
1998). More specifically, an Italian lexical unit 
has been classified as Reporting if it is the 
translation equivalent of one of the lexical units 
assigned to the Communication frame, which 
has Message as a core element. Among the 
frames using and inherited from the 
Communication frame, only the ones having the 
Message as a core element and conveying a 
giving information speech act have been 
selected and the lexical units belonging to them 
have been classified as Reporting Events: e.g. 
urlare [to scream] from the 
Communication_noise frame, sottolineare [to 
stress] from the Convey_importance frame, 
dichiarare [to declare] from the Statement 
frame. 
Similarly, for the identification of TLINKs, a 
set of decision trees has been developed to 
identify the conditions under which a temporal 
relation is to be annotated and a method to 
decide the value of the reltype attribute. For 
instance, the annotation of temporal relations 
between nominal Events and Temporal 
Expressions in the same sentence is allowed 
only when the Temporal Expression is realized 
either by an adjective or a prepositional phrase 
of the form ''di (of) + TEMPORAL 
EXPRESSION'' e.g.: 
(12.) La <EVENT eid=''e1'' ... > riunione 
</EVENT> <SIGNAL sid=''s1'' ... > di 
</SIGNAL> <TIMEX3 tid=''t1'' ... > ieri 
</TIMEX3> [yesterday meeting] 
<TLINK lid=''l1'' eventInstanceID=''e01'' 
relatedToTime=''t01'' signalID="s1" 
relType=''IS_INCLUDED''/> 
In addition, decision trees based on the idea 
that signals provide useful information to 
TLINK classification have been used to assign 
the reltype value to TLINKs holding between a 
duration and an Event. For example, the pattern 
?EVENT + tra (in) + DURATION? identifies 
the value AFTER, while the pattern ?EVENT + 
per (for) + DURATION? is associated with the 
value MEASURE. 
(13.) Il pacco <EVENT eid=''e1'' ... >arriver? 
</EVENT> <SIGNAL sid=''s1'' ... > tra 
</SIGNAL> <TIMEX3 tid=''t1'' ... > due giorni 
</TIMEX3> [the package will arrive in two 
days] 
<TLINK lid=''l1'' eventInstanceID=''e1'' 
relatedToTime=''t1'' signalID="s1" 
relType=''AFTER?/> 
(14.) Sono stati <EVENT eid=''e1'' ... > 
sposati </EVENT> <SIGNAL sid=''s1'' ... > per 
</SIGNAL> <TIMEX3 tid=''t1'' ... > dieci anni 
147
</TIMEX3> [they have been married for ten 
years] 
<TLINK lid=''l1'' eventInstanceID=''e1'' 
relatedToTime=''t1'' signalID="s1" 
relType=''MEASURE?/> 
The advantages of this formalization are 
many. The impact of the annotators' subjectivity 
is limited, thus reducing the risk of 
disagreement. Moreover, trees can then be 
easily used either as features for the 
development of a automatic learner or as 
instructions in a rule-based automatic annotation 
system. 
? Evaluating Annotations 
Two corpora have been developed in parallel 
following the It-TimeML annotation scheme, 
namely the CELCT corpus and the ILC corpus. 
Once these two corpora will be completed and 
released, they will form the Italian TimeBank 
providing the NLP community with the largest 
resource annotated with temporal and event 
information (more than 150K tokens). 
In this section, the two corpora are briefly 
described and the results of the inter-coder 
agreement (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) achieved 
during their annotation are compared in order to 
evaluate the quality of the guidelines and of the 
resources. 
The CELCT corpus has been created within 
the LiveMemories project2 and it consists of 
news stories taken from the Italian Content 
Annotation Bank (I-CAB, Magnini et al, 
2006). More than 180,000 tokens have been 
annotated with Temporal Expressions and 
more than 90,000 tokens have been annotated 
also with Events, Signals and Links. The 
Brandeis Annotation Tool3 (BAT) has been 
used for the pilot annotation and for the 
automatic computation of the inter-coder 
agreement on the extent and the attributes of 
Temporal Expressions, Events and Signals. 
After the pilot annotation, the first prototype of 
the CELCT Annotation Tool (CAT) has been 
used to perform the annotation and to compute 
the inter-coder agreement on Links. For what 
concern the annotation effort, the work on

Temporal Expressions, Events and Signals 
involved 2 annotators while 3 annotators have 
been engaged in the annotation of Links. The 
annotation started in January 2010 and required 
a total of 1.3 person/years. Table 1 shows the 
total number of annotated markables together 
with the results of the inter-coder agreement on 
tag extent performed by two annotators on a 
subset of the corpus of about four thousand 
tokens. For the annotation of Event and Signal 
extents, statistics include average precision and 
recall and Cohen? kappa, while the Dice 
Coefficient has been computed for the extent of 
Links and Temporal Expressions.

The ILC corpus is composed of 171 
newspaper stories collected from the Italian 
Syntactic-Semantic Treebank, the PAROLE 
corpus and the web for a total of 68,000 
tokens (40,398 tokens are freely available, the 
remaining are available with restrictions). The 
news reports were selected to be comparable 
in content and size to the English TimeBank 
and they are mainly about international and 
national affairs, political and financial subject. 
The annotation of Temporal Expressions, 
Event extents and Signals has been completed 
while the annotation of Event attributes and 
LINKs is a work in progress. A subset of the 
corpus has been used as data set in the 
TempEval-2 evaluation campaign organized 
within SemEval-2 in 2010. So far the 
annotation has been performed thanks to eight 
voluntary students under the supervision of 
two judges using BAT. The annotation started 
in March 2009 and is requiring a total of 3 
person/years. Table 3 reports the total number 
of Temporal Expressions, Events, Signals and 
TLINKs together with the results of the inter-
coder agreement on tag extent performed on 
about 30,000 tokens. To measure the 
agreement on tag extents, average precision 
and recall and Cohen? kappa have been 
calculated. The annotation of Temporal Links 
has been divided into three subtasks: the first 
subtask is the relation between two Temporal 
Expressions, the second is the relation 
between an Event and a Temporal Expression, 
the third regards the relation between two 
Events.

inter-coder agreement 
 
Given the data reported in the above tables, 
it is possible to claim that the results of the 
inter-coder agreement are good and 
comparable beyond the different annotation 
method used to develop the two corpora. So 
far, the ILC corpus has been annotated 
without time constraints by several annotators 
with varying backgrounds in linguistics using 
BAT. With this web-based tool, each file has 
been assigned to many annotators and an 
adjudication phase on discrepancies has been 
performed by an expert judge. As required by 
BAT, the annotation has been divided into 
many annotation layers so each annotator 
focused only on a specific set of It-TimeML 
tags. On the other hand, few expert annotators 
have been involved in the development of the 
CELCT corpus interacting and negotiating 
common solutions to controversial 
annotations. With respect to BAT, the CELCT 
Annotation Tool is stand-alone and it does not 
require neither the parallel annotation of the 
same text, nor the decomposition of 
annotation tasks allowing to have flexibility in 
the annotation process and a unitary view of 
all annotation layers. These features are 
helpful when working with strict project 
deadlines. 
A comparison with the inter-coder agreement 
achieved during the annotation of the English 
TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al, 2006a), 
shows that the scores obtained for the CELCT 
149
and the ILC corpora are substantially higher in 
the following results: (i) average precision and 
recall on the identification of tag extent (e.g. 
0.83 vs. 0.95 of ILC Corpus and 0.94 of CELCT 
Corpus for TIMEX3; 0.78 vs. 0.87 of ILC 
Corpus and 0.93 of CECLT Corpus); (ii) kappa 
score on Event classification (0.67 vs. 0.82 of 
ILC Corpus and 0.87 of the CELCT Corpus); 
(iii) kappa score on TLINK classification (0.77 
vs. 0.86 of CELCT Corpus). 
The similarity of the agreement results among 
the three resources and the improvement of the 
scores obtained on the CELCT and the ILC 
corpora with respect to the English TimeBank 
1.2, can be taken as an indication of the quality 
and coverage of the It-TimeML annotation 
guidelines and specifications. Annotators 
showed to perform consistently demonstrating 
the reliability of the annotation scheme. 
? Conclusions and Future Works 
This paper reports on the creation of a new 
semantic resource for Italian which has been 
developed independently but with a joint effort 
between two different research institutions. The 
Ita-TimeBank will represent a large corpus 
annotated with information for temporal 
processing which can boost the multilingual 
research in this field and represent a case study 
for the creation of semantic annotated resources. 
One of the most interesting point of this work 
is represented by the methodology followed for 
the development of the corpora: in addition to 
the guidelines, annotation specifications have 
been created in order to report in detail the 
actual choices done during the annotation. This 
element should be pushed forward in the 
community as a new best practice for the 
creation of good quality semantically annotated 
resources. 
The results obtained show the reliability of 
the adaptation of the annotation guidelines to 
Italian and of the methodology used for the 
creation of the resources. 
Future works will concentrate in different 
directions, mainly due to the research interests 
of the two groups which have taken part to this 
effort but they will be coordinated. 
An interesting aspect which could be 
investigated is the annotation of the anaphoric 
relations between Events. This effort could be 
done in a more reliable way since the primary 
linguistic items have been already annotated. 
Moreover, this should boost research in the 
development of annotation schemes which could 
be easily integrated with each other without 
losing descriptive and representational 
information for other language phenomena. 
Another topic to deepen regards the definition 
of the appropriate argument structure in It-
TimeML in order to annotate relations between 
entities (e.g. persons and organizations) and 
Events in which they are involved (Pustejovsky 
et al, 2006b). 
As regards the distribution of the Ita-
TimeBank, the resource will soon be available 
in an in-line format. In order to integrate the 
temporal annotation with other linguistic 
annotations, a standoff version of the Ita-
TimeBank needs to be developed. When this is 
made available, we plan to merge the manual 
annotation of temporal and event information 
with other types of linguistic stand-off 
annotations (i.e. tokenization, lemma, PoS, 
multi-words, various kinds of named entities) 
which are already available for the I-CAB 
corpus.  
In order to encourage research on systems 
capable of temporal inference and event-based 
reasoning, the Ita-TimeBank could be used as 
gold standard within specific evaluation 
campaigns as the next TempEval initiative. 
Finally, the use of crowdsourcing will be 
explored to reduce annotation effort in terms of 
financial cost and time. The most difficult 
challenge to face will be the splitting of a 
complicated annotation scheme as It-TimeML 
into simple tasks which can be effectively 
performed by not expert contributors.
