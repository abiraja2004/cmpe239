1 t. Background 
Bede i s  essent ia l l y  a research  pro jec t :  we are not 
immediate ly  concerned wi th  commercial  app l i ca t ions ,  thouek 
such are c lear ly  p~ss ib le  i f  the research  proves f ru i t fu l .  
Work on Bede at  th i s  s tage  thoueh i s  p r imar i l y  exper imenta l .  
The aim at  the moment i s  to invest igate  the  extent  to  which 
a mic roprocessor -based  ~.T .  system of advanced des ign  i s  
poss ib le ,  and the l im i ta t ions  that  have to be imposed in  order  
to. ach ieve  a workin 8 system. This paper descr ibes  the overa l l  
system des ign  spec i f i ca t ion  to  which ~ are cur rent ly  work ine.  
In  the bas ic  des ign  of  the system we attempt to  incor -  
porate  as much as poss ib le  features  of  la rge-sca le  ~.T? sys -  
tems that  have proved to be des i rab le  or  e f fec t ive .  Thus, Beds 
i s  mu l t l l i ngua l  by des ign  ( i .e .  not based on language pa i rs )  
(of. King, 1981:12)! algorithms and linguistic data are 
strictly separated (of. Johnson, 1979:140); and the system is 
designed in more or less independent modules (of? Vauquols, 
1965:33) ?

The microprocessor  environment means that  oz~Lteria of 
s i ze  are impor tant :  data s t ruc ture  both dynamic (c reated  by 
and maz~pulated dur ing  the t rans la t ion  process)  and s ta t i c  
(d ic t ionar ies  and l ingu is t i c  ru le  packages) are const ra ined  
to be as economical in  terms of s torage space and access 
procedures as poss ib le ,L imi ta t ions  on in -core  and per iphera l  
s torage  are important  cons iderat ions  in  the system des ign .  
In  la rge  ~enera l  purpose M.T. systems, i t  i s  necessary  
to assume that  fa i lu re  to t rans la te  g iven input  cor rec t ly  i s  
genera l ly  not  due to incozTect ly  formed input ,  but to insu f f -  
i c ient ly  e laborated  t rans la t ion  a lgor i thms.  This i s  par t i cu l -  
a r ly  due to two problems: the lex ica l  problem of choice of 
~ppropr ia te  t rans la t ion  equ iva lents ,  and the s t ra te~c problem 
of e f fec t ive  ana lys i s  of the wide r~e of syntact i c  pat terns  
found in  natura l  langu~e.  The reduct ion  of these problems v ia  
the not ions  of cont ro l led  vocabulary  and res t r i c ted  e~rntax 
seem par t i cu la r ly  appropz~ate in  the microprocessor  env i ron-  
ment, s ince  the a l te rnat ive  of making a system in f in i te ly  
extendable  i s  probably not feas ib le .  Both not ions  have been 
t r ied  w~th b igger  systems, resu l t ing  both in  bet ter  resu l t s  
f rom the M.T. system i t se l f ,  and in  inc reased  leF~Lbi l i ty from 
a human po int  of view of source texts  (c f .  Ducro%, 1972! E l l i -  
e ton ,  1978! Lawson, 1979"81-21 So~ners and McNaught, 1980:49) .  
Given these const ra in ts ,  i t  seems feas ib le  to achieve 
t rans la t ion  v ia  an " in ter l ingus"  (c f .  Ve i l l on ,  1969! Hutchiz~s, 
1978z 131), in  which the canon ica l  s t ruc tures  from the source 
lan&n~a~e =are mapped d i rec t ly  onto those of the ta rget  lan4gaa- 
ge(s ) ,  avo id ing  any langua~e-pe~ir o r iented  " t rans fer "  ste4~e. 
~=ranslat ion thus takes place in  two phases= ana lys i s  of source 
text  and  synthes is  of ta rget  text .  
2 t Brief description 
A descr ip t ion  of the system forms the second ha l f  of 
the proposed paper. For the sake of clarity and brevity in

this summary, we refer to the attached schematic representat- 
ion of the translation process in Bede. In the full version o~ 
th i s  paper,  each s tep  i s  to  be out l ined  in  ra ther  more deta i l .  
The ana lyser  uses a char t - l i ke  s t ruc ture  (o f .  Kaplan, 
1973) to produce the interface trees of the abstract inter- 
lingual representation. These trees serve as input to syn- 
thesis, where they are reazTan~ed into valid surface structur- 
es fo r  the  ta rget  ~age.  
The source text  i s  t rans la ted  sentence by sentence  (or  
equ iva lent ) .  Text i s  f i r s t  s.ubJeoted to a two-s ta~e morpholog- 
i ca l  ana lys i s .  In  the f i r s t  s tage  the text  i s  compared word 
by word wi th  a s top- l i s t  of  f requent ly  occur r ing  words (most-  
l y  funct ion  words)!  words not found in  the s top- l i s t  undergo 
morpho log ica l  ana lys i s ,  aga in  on a word by word bas i s .  Morpho- 
log ica l  rules form a finlte-state grammar of affix-strlpping 
rules (?A rules') and the output is a chart with labelled 
arcs indicating lexical item and possible interpretation of 
stripped affixes, as confirmed by dictionary look-up. The 
morphological analysis phase also creates a temporary "sent- 
ence dlctionary~ consistin~ of copies of the dictionary entr- 
ies for (only) those lexical items found in the current 
t rans la t ion  un i t .  
The char t  then undergoes a two-s ta~e eyntact i co~semant -  
io  an~ys is .  In  the f i r s t  s tage ,  context -sens i t i ve  phrase-  
- s t ruc ture  ru les  ("E ru les" )  work towards c reat ing  a s ing le  
arc  spanning the ent i re  t rans la t ion  un i t -  a rcs  are  labe l led  
w i th  appropr ia te  syntact i c  c lass  and syntact i co -semant ic  
feature information and a trace of the lower arcs which have 
been subsumed. In the second stage, the tree structure implied 
by the labels and traces on these arcs is disjoined from the 
~aph and undergoes general tree-to-tree-transduction rules 
("T z~les') resulting in a single tree structure representing 
the canon ica l  form of the t rans la t ion  un i t .  With source - lang-  
uage lex ica l  i tems rep laced  by unique mul t i l i ngua l -d ic t ionary j

addresses ,  th i s  i s  the  in ter l in6ua  which i s  passed  fo r  syn-  
thes i s  in to  the  ta rget  language(s ) .  
Synthes is  cons is ts  of a combinat ion  o f  T ru les  which re -  
ass ign  new order  and s t ructure  to  the  ln ter l ingua ,  and of  con-  
text -sens i t ive  ru les  which can be used to  ass ign  main ly  syn-  
tac t i c  feature  labe ls  to  leaves  ("L ru le~) ,  fo r  example fo r  
the  purpose of  ass ign ing  number and gender  concord (e tc . ) .  The 
resu l t ing  l i s t  of  labe l led  leaves  ( the  superi~or branches  are  
no longer  needed) i s  passed to  morpho log ica l  synthes is  where 
a f in i te -s ta te  grsmmar o f  morphographenLlc and a f f i xa t ion  
ru les  produces the  ta rget  s t r ing .  
As can be seen ,  the  system i s  s t r i c t ly  modular ,  and a t  
each in ter face  on ly  a smal l  par t  of the  data  s t ruc tures  used 
by the  donat ing  module i s  requ i red  by the  rece iv ing  module.  
The "unwanted" data  s t ruc tures  a re  wr i t ten  to  per iphera l  s to re  
to  enab le  recovery  of  par t ia l  s t ruc tures  in  the case  of  fa i l -  
ure  or  mis t rans la t ion ,  though automat ic  back - t rack ing  to  
prev ious  modules by the system as such i s  not  env isaged as a 
maj or component. 
The "static" data Used by the system consist of the 
different sets of linEulstio rule packages, plus the diction- 
ary. The system essentially has one large multillngual diction- 
ary from which numerous software packages generate various 
subdlctionarles as required either in the translation process 
itself, or for lexloographers working on the system. Alpha- 
betioal or other structured language-speciflc listings can be 
produced, while of course dictionary updating and editing 
pack~es are also provided. 
~ Implementation details 
The system will run on any microprocessor system which 
runs under the CP/M operating system and at C.0.L. is implem- 
ented on the Intertec Superbrain with twin ~ '  double density 
floppy disk drives, giving a total of 320k bytes of on-llne

s tore .  Programs are  wr i t ten  in  Pasca l /M (Scrod ,  1979) ,  a 
Pascal dialect closely resembl i~ UCSD Pascal.
