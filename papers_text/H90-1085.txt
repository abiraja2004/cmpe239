Our plan is to demonstrate a workstation accelerator 
(called PLUS) that not only executes the current speech 
recognition systems in real time, but that will also support 
the increasing computational demands of speech recog- 
nition systems in the next several years. The accelerator 
will also be useful for other compute-bound applications. 
The accelerator will be replicated and made available to 
other sites. 
Our approach is to connect single-processor machines of 
roughly the performance of high-end workstations by 
means of a very fast and powerful communication 
mechanism. This makes the memory on each node visible 
to every other node as if the system were a single shared- 
memory multiprocessor. The prototype, for example, uses 
25MHz Motorola 88000 processors with up to 32 Mbytes 
of DRAM memory and 512 Kbytes of SRAM in each 
node; the interconnection is based on a MOSIS-built mesh 
router with 40Mbytes/sec bandwidth. 
PLUS research contribution comprises new mechanisms 
to support shared-memory and synchronization between 
processors. The emphasis i  on low latency and low over- 
head synchronization. 
The PLUS prototype is interfaced to host computer sys- 
tems by means of a SCSI interface, this interface can also 
perform speech input/output and limited signal processing. 
Interfacing PLUS to a host does not require any operating 
system change on the host. 
We have completed the design of both the PLUS board 
and of the host interface. After fabrication i s completed we 
expect o take about two months for debugging and then 
start replication. Minimal software (sufficient, for example, 
for running the Sphinx system) is already available.
