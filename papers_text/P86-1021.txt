ABSTRACT 
We propose a mapping between prosodic phenomena nd 
semantico-pragmatic effects based upon the hypothesis that intona- 
tion conveys information about the intentional as well as the atten- 
tional structure of discourse. In particular, we discuss how varia- 
tions in pitch range and choice of accent and tune can help to con- 
vey such information as: discourse segmentation and topic struc- 
ture, appropriate choice of referent, the distinction between 'given' 
and 'new' information, conceptual contrast or parallelism between 
mentioned items, and subordination relationships between proposi- 
tions salient in the discourse. Our goals for this research are prac- 
tical as well as theoretical. In particular, we are investigating the 
problem of intonational ssignment in synthetic speech. 
1. In t roduct ion  
The role of prosody in discourse has been generally ack- 
nowledged but little understood. Linguistic pragmaticists have 
noted that types of in fo rmat ion  s ta tus  (such as g lven /new,  
top lc /comment ,  focus /presuppos i t ion)  can be intonationally 
'marked' \[1,2,3,4\], that  re fe rence  reso lu t ion  may depend criti- 
cally on intonation \[5, 6\], that  intonation can be used to disambigu- 
ate among potentially ambiguous utterances \[7,8\], and that 
i nd i rec t  speech  acts  may be signalled by intonational 
means \[9,10,11\]. Conversational analysis of naturally occurring 
data has found that speakers may signal top ic  shift ,  d igress ion,  
and in ter rupt ion ,  as well as tu rn - tak ing ,  intonation- 
ally \[12, 13, 141 . And the fact that intonational contours contribute 
in some way to utterance interpretation is itself unexception- 
able \[8\]. To date, however, identification of the prosodic 
phenomena involved -- and the proper mapping between thcse 
phenomena nd their semantico-pragmatic effects -- has been 
largely intuitive, and the intonational phenomena involved have 
not been precisely described. 
Here, we describe how certain of the resources of the intona- 
tional system are employed in discourse. In particular, we discuss 
how speakers' choice of p i tch  range,  accent ,  and tune  contribute 
to the in tent iona l  and a t tent lona l  structuring of discourse -- the 
way speakers communicate the relationships among their discourse 
goals and the relative salience of entities, attributes, and relation- 
ships mentioned in the discourse) Our findings emerge from an 
intensive study of a simple example of speech synthesis: the script 
of a computer-aided instruction system, TNT (Tutor 'n' 
Trainer) \[16\], which employs synthetic speech to tutor computer 
novices in the text editor vi. Using the Text to Speech system 
(TTS) i17\], we have been able, by systematic variation of pitch 
1. Grosz and Sidaer \[15\] propose a tripartite view of discourse structure: a 
llngnlstlc structure, which is the text/speech itself; an attentlonal struc- 
ture, including information about he relative salience of objects, properties, 
relations, and intentions at a given point in the discourse; and an Intentional 
structure, which relates dlscourse segment purposes (those purposes whose 
recognition is essential to a segment achieving its intended effect) to one 
another. 
range and by a principled choice of accent and tune, to highlight 
the structure of the tutorial text and thus to enhance its coherence. 
While most studies of how intonation is used in discourse, have 
been based solely on examination of intonational contours found in 
a natural corpus, we have found that intonation synthesis provides 
a unique opportunity to manipulate the dimensions of variation 
orthogonally. Thus we can pinpoint factors crucial for a given 
effect and evaluate various patterns for a given utterance and con- 
text. 
2. The  Domain  
TNT was designed to teach computer-naive subjects vi, a 
simple UNIX screen-oriented text editor. The tutorial portion pro- 
vides a brief introduction to word processing, to general features of 
vi, and to the tutor's help facilities; the tutor then guides subjects 
through a series of learning tasks of graduated ifficulty. While 
the overall task structure is implicit in the tutorial text, the sub- 
ject can influence the course of the interaction via his/her manipu- 
lation of a set of 'helper' keys; these keys provide hints (HINT) and 
reminders (REMIND) as well as the option of start ing a task over 
again (DO OVER) or suspending the tutorial temporarily (HOLD). 
The fact that  TNT is explicitly task-oriented, 2 makes it a 
good test-bed for our purposes. An appropriate segmentation of
the text, and a notion of the purpose of each segment and the 
hierarchical relationships among segments, can be independently 
determined from the task at hand. Also, certain characteristics of 
the text presented a particularly interesting challenge for our 
study. First, the script contains little pronominal reference and 
very few so-called clue words  - words  and phrases such as now, 
next, returning to, but, and on the other hand, which can identify 
discourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments, 
signal interruptions and digressions, and so on \[19,20\]. Both of 
these phenomena (together with intonation) have been identified as 
important strategies for communicating discourse struc- 
ture \[15,18,19\]. Their virtual absence from the text presents a 
convenient opportunity for testing the power of intonation to 
structure a discourse. Second, while we were not able to isolate 
points in the text where subjects had special difficulties, we did 
informally observe certain general problems with tu rn - tak ing  3 in 
the tutor -- specifically, it was not always clear when the tutor's 
turn was over - which we addressed in our synthesis of the text. 
3. FO Synthes is  
To synthesize the fundamental frequency (f0) contours for 
the TNT script, we used the intonation synthesis program 
2. That is, the tutorial is organized around aseries of data processing tasks, which 
the subject is guided through. See \[18\] for discussion of the characteristics of 
task-oriented domain discourse.

described in \[22\] in \[23, 24\]. It permits explicit control over the dif- 
ferent dimensions of variation in the intonation system. The 
dimensions we will discuss here are phras ing,  p i tch range, 
accent location, and tune.  We illustrate each in our synthesis of 
the introduction to TNT:

F igure  1. The TNT Introduct ion 
In Figure 1 and in all figures below, 'T '  indicates the top of the 
pitch range in Hz, 'F '  indicates amount of compression of the pitch 
range at the end of declarative phrases, 'H' and 'L' indicate high 
and low tones, '*' indicates a tone's alignment with a stressed syll- 
able, and '%'  indicates a phrase boundary tone. We discuss these 
phenomena and our notational system in more detail below. 
3.1 Phras ing  
The first dimension of variation, phras ing,  may be indi- 
cated by a pause, by a lengthening of the phrase-final syllable, and 
by the occurrence" of extra melodic elements on the end of the 
phrase. Variation in phrasing is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. 4 In 
Figure 2, line 8 is produced as a single phrase, whereas in Figure 3, 
And is set off as a separate phrase. 
One consequence of this strategy is that And becomes more prom- 
inent in the second version. Phrasing variation will not be of cen- 
tral concern here. Because of the syntactic simplicity of TNT, 
there were only a few cases where the phrasing could be varied in 
interesting ways.

3.2 P i tch  Range 
When a speaker aises his/her voice, his/her overall p i tch 
range - the distance betweer~ the highest point in the f0 contour 
and the speaker's basel ine (defined by the lowest point a speaker 
realizes over all utterances) -- is expanded. Thus, the highest 
points in the contour become higher and other aspects are propor- 
tionately affected. Figure 4 shows an f0 contour for line 1 in the 
scriot above in the default pitch range used by TTS.

F igure  5. Actual Pitch Range 
The shape of the actual contour is the same as in Figure 4 but its 
scaling is different. Changes in pitch range appear to reflect the 
overall structure of the discourse, with major topic shifts marked 
by marked increases in pitch range. 
In addition to variations in overall pitch range, the intona- 
tion system exploits a local time-dependent type of pitch range 
variation, called final lowering. In the experiments reported 
in \[24\], it was found that the pitch range in declaratives i lowered 
and compressed in .anticipation of the end of the utterance. Final 
lowering begins about half a second before the end and gradually 
increases, reaching its greatest strength right at the end of the 
utterance. This phenomenon appears to reflect the degree of 'final- 
ity' of an utterance; the more final lowering, the more the sense 
that an utterance 'completes' a topic is conveyed. Contrast Fig- 
ures 6 and 7.

F igure  7. Without Final Lowering 
In the notational system employed here, T represents the 
topl ine, of a phrase -- the maximal value for the f0 contour in the 
phrase. F expresses the amount of final lowering in terms of the 
ratio of the lowered pitch range to the starting pitch range. The 
default value assumed below for T is 115 Hz and for F is 0.87. 
3.3 Accent  
P i tch  accents,  which fall on the stressed syllable of lexical 
items, mark those items as intonationally prominent. In line 16, for 
example, right has no pitch accent. If right were to be especially 
emphasized, it would have an accent. (In our notation, the absence 
of a specified accent indicates that a word is not  accented; where 
we wish to highlight this point, we will employ '-' to mark a deac- 
cented word.) The contrasting outcomes are shown in Figures 8 and 
9.

BUT IF THE COMPUTER IS NOT WORKING RIGHT 
F igure  9. Right Accented 
In the first case, the last f0 peak occurs on work and there is a fall 
to a low pitch on right, then a rise at the end of the phrase. In the 
second case, the entire peak-fall-rise configuration occurs on the 
word right. 
There are six types of pitch accent in English \[23\], two sim- 
ple tones -- high and low -- and four complex ones. The most fre- 
quently used accent, the simple high tone, comes out as a peak on 
the accented syllable (as, on right in Figure 9) and will be 
represented below as H*. The 'H' indicates a high tone, and the '*' 
that the tone is aligned with a stressed syllable. In some cases, we 
have used a L* accent, which occurs much lower in the pitch range 
than H* and is phonetically realized as a local f0 minimum. The 
accent on make in Figure 13 below is a L*. The other English 
accents have two tones. Figure 10 shows a version of the sentence 
in Figures 2 and 3 with a L+t t*  accent substituted for both H* 
accents in the second phrase.

Note that there are still peaks on the stressed syllables, but now a 
striking valley occurs just before each peak. 
In our synthesis of the TNT script, we have made extensive 
use of the type of accent ranscribed in \[23\] as H*+L.  This accent, 
like other bitonal accents, triggers a rule which compresses the 
pitch range on following material in the phrase, a phenomenon 
known as downstep  or catathes ls .  For example, a simple con- 
trast between H* H* and H*+L H*+L is illustrated in Figures 11 
and 12 in two versions of the tutorial command to hit the 'remind' 
helper key -- Hit remind.

We have made particular use of downstepped contours uch as this 
-- i.e., sequences of H*4-L tones -- which we will term H*+L 
sequence  in the discussion below. (See Section 4.3.) The way a 
speaker is structuring a text helps to determine where pitch 
accents will fall, as a speaker indicates how referents of accented or 
deaccented items are related to other items in the utterance or in 
some larger context. 
In addition to pitch accents, each intonational phrase has a 
phrase  accent  and a boundary  tone. These two extra tones 
may be either L or H. The boundary tone (indicated by '~o') falls 
exactly at the phrase boundary, while the phrase accent (indicated 
by an unadorned H or L) spreads over the material between the 
last pitch accent and the boundary tone. Each intonational phrase 
contains one or more pitch accents, a phrase accent, and a boun- 
dary tone. 
3.4 Tune  
A phrase's tune  or melody is defined by its particular 
sequence of pitch accents, phrase accent, and boundary tone. 
Thus, H* L L~o represents a tune with a H* pitch accent, a L 
phrase accent, and a L~:~ boundary tone. This is an ordinary 
declarative pattern with a final fall. A interrogative contour is 
represented by L* H H~o. The contrast between these two melo- 
dies is illustrated in Figures 13 and 14. Figure 13 shows the actual 
f0 contour for line 5 of the TNT introduction, produced as a ques- 
tion.

With the declarative intonation characteristic of imperatives, 5
would probably convey that the hearer was being ordered to pro- 
duce a typo. Roughly speaking, the tune appears to convey infor- 
mation about speaker attitudes and intentions (as, the speech act 
the speaker intends to perform) and about the relationship between 
utterances in a discourse.

4. In tonat iona l  and Discourse Phenomena 
The major questions underlying our research are: First, 
what is the relationship between particular'-,intonational 
phenomena nd particular discourse phenomena?~ For example, 
what discourse phenomena re associated with eh?~iges in pitch 
range? With the accenting or deaccenting of particular lexical 
items? With choice of tune? More generally, we also characterize 
the contributions of these intonational phenomena in terms of the 
theory.of, discourse structure developed in \[15\], by relating intoua- 
tionM .contributions to aspects of intentional and attentional 
discourse structure. Second, how do int0na~ionul features uch as 
these interact with one another? Does an expansion of pitch range 
affect the interpretation of a rise-fal l-r ise contour \[25\], for exam- 
ple, and if so how? Third, when several discourse features predict 
conflicting intonational strategies, how is a decision made? When 
the information represented by a single referring expression, for 
example, is both 'given' and 'contrastive' -- and thus both deac- 
centable and accentable -- how is the choice to be made? 
4.1 P i tch  Range Man ipu la t ion  
Students of discourse commonly observe that discourses 
often exhibit a hierarchical structure - into major topics, their 
subtopics, sub-subtopics, and so on. In task-oriented omains, it 
has been claimed that this structure reflects the hierarchical struc- 
ture of a task and its subtasks \[18\]. So, for example, the TNT 
introduction above might be segmented as follows (where utter- 
ances are labeled by line number): 5 
Tab le  1. Segmenting the TNT Introduction 
{0 
3 4 
6 7 9 10 11 
This bracketing schema defines a discourse segment as any node 
together with all the nodes it dominates; for example, lines 1-11 
form a segment, as do lines 14-16, and so on. An alternative depic- 
tion of the hierarchy above would be \[{0}\[1/2 3 \[4 \[5 6 7\] \[8 9 10 
11\]\]\] \[12 \[13\] [14 15 16\]\]\]fi Evidence for such hierarchical segmenta- 
tion in general is found in instances of pronominal reference to 
referents linearly distant in the discourse; in such cases, a notion of 
hierarchical proximity appears plausible. 
Previous research \[12,14\] has observed that 'topic jump' 
can be signalled by raised pitch, as well as increased a~plitude and 
markers of self-editing, hesitation, and discontinuity - .and  that 
pauses and changes in rate characterize segment boundaries. In 
our work with the TNT script, we found that a hierarchical seg- 
mentation of discourse can be marked by systematic variation in 
pitch range, which can signal movement betweeen levels in the seg- 
ment hierarchy. In addition, by varying the amount of final rais'ihg 
or lowering at the end of phrases, we can indicate the degree of 
conceptual continuity between one phrase and the next. We have 
developed algorithms for assigning pitch range and fiual 
raising/lowering in terms of the discourse segmentation. 
5. We do not claim this is the only possible segmentation, ly that it is a plausi- 
ble one to convey. 
6. Note that I and 2 are treated as a unit here, although they are synthesized as 
separate phrases, since it seemed semantically correct. 
To illustrate the algorithms, we relate the TNT introduction 
presented in Figure 1 to its segmentation i Table 1. When the 
introduction is synthesized using the TTS'default pitch range of 
75-11~ Hz, the topline for each utterance will remain around 115 
Hz. However, the hierarchical relationship schematized above 
among the various segments may be signalled more clearly if the 
pitch range is varied. In our version of the script, each segment 
boundary is marked by a variation in pitch range which correlates 
with the segment's position in the overall discourse. So, major 
boundaries are denoted by the largest increases, with smaller 
increases marking subsegment boundaries, and so on. The segment 
beginning at 1, for example, is marked by raising the f0 topline to 
150 Hz; that beginning at 14, by raising the topline to 136 Hz; and 
that beginning at 15, by raising the topline to 125 Hz. 7 Human 
speakers do seem to employ a wider spectrum of pitch range varia- 
tion than we have been able to use in synthesis, however. 
We would claim that the appropriateness of changes in pitch 
range is a function of the segmentation hierarchy -- and is not 
inherent in the utterance in isolation. Our algorithm for pitch 
range assignment can in fact enforce one segmentation of a given 
discourse over another and, in so doing, can disambiguate among 
potentially ambiguous reference resolutions. For example, It in line 
7 of Figure 1 coindexes mistake, while it in line 8 coindexes word 
processing. A simple linear approach to reference resolution (such 
as \[26\] ) would have the second coindexical with the previous 
noun-phrase (np), mistake, but a hierarchical approach to discourse 
structure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segment 
dominating the current segment may also provide a referent \[18\], 
as, in fact, is the case here. While a little thought will make the 
appropriate referent clear, it is clearer when line 8 is produced 
with a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subseg- 
ment of the segment headed by 4. By so doing, we lessen the possi- 
bility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines.:5-7..The 
most likely candidate, found in 4, is now both intonationally and 
conceptually 8's superordinate discourse segment. 
While an increase in the pitch range indicates egment boun- 
daries, a decrease in the final lowering effects can indicate the 
absence of such boundaries, and thus indicate that a given utter- 
ance and one which follows it are part of the same segment. So, 
manipulation of final lowering can also serve to indicate discourse 
structure, by identifying the internal structure of segments. For 
example, at one point in the TNT script, the following utterance 
constitutes an entire discourse segment, so it has ,the default final 
lowering (F=0.87); in consequence, the L~ tone at the end of had 
will be only 87% as high as it would have been if final lowering had 
not applied. 
F.87 Type had. 
H* H* L L~ 
Compare this with: 
Type had. 
F.93 H* H* L L~ 
When you ' re  done, 
H* L H~

H* L L~ 
Here, the same utterance is synthesized with less final lowering -- 
the L~ tone at the end of had, in particular, will attain 93% of its 
target height. In this segment, the first line does not  end the seg- 
ment. We further propose that the degree of final lowering may 
correlate with the utterance's position in the discourse hierarchy. 
Specifically, we suggest hat minimal final lowering may indicate a 
'push' onto the segment stack and greater degrees of final lowering 
Our choice of ranges was determined in part by the TTS  synthesizer, which 
tends to sound best when its topline ranges between 115-150 Hz. Preliminary 
investigation of pitch range changes in human speech indicates that, for male 
speakers, these choices are reasonable. Note also that it is the relationship 
among different range levels, not the actual values in Hz, which is important 
here. 
140 
may be associated with 'pops' of this stack. In our synthesis of the 
TNT text, we have varied degree of final lowering for such 'pops' 
based upon the level of the segment which this utterance 'com- 
pletes' (or, equivalently, the level of the segment the next utterance 
begins). So, to determine the amount of final lowering to assign 
when synthesizing line 7 in the TNT introduction, we first deter- 
mine whether it completes a segment (representing a pop) or not 
(representing a push). If the former, we may note either that it 
completes the segment begun at line 5 (with a topline of 136 Hz), or 
that the subsequent segment is begun (by line 8) with a topline of 
136 Hz. We assign final lowering of 0.90 when synthesizing line 7 
based on either observation; this rather large amount (close to the 
synthesizer's default maximum of 0,87) conveys a relatively impor- 
tant change of subtopic within the larger discourse segment by 
indicating rather more disjunction than we would want, for exam- 
ple, between lines 9 and 10. 
We are currently testing the associations between pitch 
range/ final lowering variation and discourse structure proposed 
above in several ways: by pitch-tracking a large corpus of natural 
speech, 8 by recording and analyzing subjects reading structured 
texts, and by asking subjects to perform tasks such as reference 
resolution from texts synthesized with varying pitch ranges. 
4.2 Accent  P lacement  
Accent placement, too, can convey information about the 
structure of a discourse. Traditionally, it has been noted that 
stress, or accent, can convey information about the focus of an 
utterance, about given or new information in the discourse, o about 
parallelism, or about contrastiveness. In more general terms, one 
might say that accent placement appears to be associated with 
Grosz and Sidner's \[15\] at tent lona l  structure -- the salience of 
discourse ntities, properties, relations, and intentions at any point 
in the discourse. We have particularly noted that the decision to 
accent or deaccent some item is sensitive to the position of that 
item in the discourse structure - that is, just as salience is always 
determined relative to some particular context, accent placement 
must be determined with respect to the segment in which the 
accentable item appears. We take the position that it is the signal- 
ing of salience relative to the discourse segment that produces the 
secondary effects of given-new distinction, topic-hood or contras- 
tiveness, and the favoring of one reference resolution over another. 
One of the more common observations about the role of 
accent placement and the structuring of discourse is that accent 
can mark some item in the discourse as in focus - i.e., as 'what is 
being talked about' \[28,29} -- particularly when syntactic or 
thematic information might predict otherwise. For example, in the 
following instructions, erase is accented in line 2 to indicate that 
the action of 'erasing' is the focus of the current ask. 
1. Type hello. 
H* H* L L~ 
2.  Next, let's erase hello. 
H* L H~ H* H* - L L~ 
3. Hit hint. 
H* H* L L~ 
For similar reasons, we accent hello in line 1 and deaccent it in line 
2. 
While focus considerations clearly influence accent place- 
ment, determining accent placement solely on the basis of 
utterance-level focus (as proposed in Gussenhoven \[29} and Cull- 
From interviews collected by A. Kroch and G. Ward and from recordings made 
of a radio f inancial advise program by J. H i rschberg and M. Pol lack. 
Prince \[271 notes that the 'given/new' distinction has been variously defined as 
predictable/unpredictable, sa ient/not salient, shared/not shared knowledge, 
and proposes a more complex taxonomy of 'assumed familiarity' classifying 
discourse ntities as new, inferrable, or evoked (either textually or situation- 
ally). Th is  is closely related -- and often confused with -- the notion of utter-  
ance topic/ focus.  
cover and Rochemont \[30\] ) is insufficient. Considerations such as 
the given/new distinction play an important role. 
Speakers typically deaeeent given information and accent 
new information, as when the 'new' information typing is accented 
and the 'old' word processing is not in line 3 below: 
Welcome to word processing. 
B* H* L L~ 
That's using a computer to write letters 
H* H* H* H* H* 
and reports. 
H* L L~ 
Word processing makes typing easy. 
H* H* H* L L~ 
Note that these items are marked as 'given' and 'new' within the 
current segment -- although they may have other status within the 
larger discourse. Furthermore, items appear 'given' or 'new' not 
simply because of prior mention (or lack thereof) in a context but 
via 'physical co-presence', where speaker, hearer, and referents are 
physically and openly present together; \[31\] shared world 
knowledge; or conceptual proximity \[11. For example, the tutor can 
treat m as given in the following text because the student has just 
(incorrectly) typed mary; the character 'm', the student, and the 
tutor, are thus physically copresent. 
Oops. capital m. 
H* L H~ H* - L L~ 
The new information is that 'm' is to be capitalized. Thus cap~al 
is accented. Similarly, in the introduction to the tutor presented in 
Figure 1, we can deaccent m~take because it is a super-cQncept of
the previously mentioned typo: 
Make a type? 
L* H* H H~ 
No problem. 
H* H* L L~ 
Just back  up, type over the  mistake, 
H* H* L H~ H* H* L H~ 
and it's gone.  
H* L L~ 
We also examine how pronominalization i teracts with 
accent placement. Since the ability to pronominalize is itself a 
standard test of givenness, prowords ,  like other given items, are 
commonly deaecented. If they are accented, the hearer may draw 
very different conclusions from an utterance. The following utter- 
ance, for example, may well convey an instruction to type the word 
something or even a reprimand for not typing anything yet: 
Let's hegln by typing something. 
H* H* H* 
Since the TNT script employes little pronominalization, we often 
use deaccenting to 'intonationally pronominalize' repetitions of lex- 
ical items. 
Accent can also signal that a discourse referent other than 
that which would be 'most likely' without special accentuation 
should be sought, as in: 
I. 
2. 
We can't answer questions, if you are confused. 
H* H* H* L H~ H* L L~ 
We have to le~ the computer do all the teaching. 
H* H* H* H* L LS 
Here (and in particular at line 1), we is intended to refer to the 
humans supervising the testing of the tutor, although these 
humans have not  previously been mentioned in the script. How- 
ever, this reference might easily be interpreted as referring to the 
141 
tutorial system itself. Since pronouns -- as 'given' information -- 
are commonly deaccented, we accent this one to indicate that an 
'unusual' referent should be sought, 10 So, both accent placement 
and manipulation of pitch range can be used to reorder the list of 
potential referents for a given referring expression. 
FinMly, eontrastiveness or parallelism may also be commun- 
icated via accent. For example, second is accented in 3, although it 
is certainly given in this segment (via mention of second draft in 1): 
I. Nned a second draft? 
L* L* L* H H~ 
2. No problem. 
H* H* L L~ 
3. Just change the first, and you've got the second. 
H* H* L H~ H* H* L L~ 
Note that, while second may be 'given' at the discourse segment 
level, the decision to accent it is based on contrast within a smaller 
context, 3. Furthermore, if this function of accent is ignored, con- 
trastiveness may be inferred incorrectly. If we accent we in the 
last line of the tutorial introduction WE will help you out, for exam- 
ple, the student would be entitled to infer that others will not be 
helpful. 
We are currently developing Mgorithms for determining 
accent placement, based upon the interaction of focus, given/new, 
parallelism, contrastiveness, and pronominal reference within seg- 
ment and phrase. 
4.3 Choice of Tune  
It is now widely accepted that the overall melody a speaker 
employs in an utterance can communicate some semantic or prag- 
matic information. However, since there are few particular tune 
types for which we can specify with any confidence just what the 
meaning might be, it is difficult to generalize about what type of 
information tunes in generM can convey. From those tunes whose 
'meaning' seems fairly well understood -- namely, declarat ive, 
yes-no quest ion \[23\], surpr l se / redundancy  \[10\], contrad ic t ion  
contour  \[33\] r ise-fal l-r lse \[25\], and cont inuat ion  rise \[34,35\] 
contours -- we propose that tunes convey two sorts of information 
about discourse. 
First, we believe that contours can convey propos i t ional  
a t t l tudes  n the speaker wishes to associate with the propositional 
content of an utterance. For example, the speaker may wish to 
convey that s/he knows x, or that s/he believes x, or that s/he is 
uncertain about x, or that s/he is ignorant of x. In the case of 
H*+L sequences, it appears that a speaker may convey his/her 
(propositional) attitudes about a hearer's (propositional) attitudes 
toward an utterances. This tune seems to indicate the speaker's 
belief that the speech act s/he is performing is superfluous. For 
example, a speaker may employ it to convey that the propositional 
content of his/her utterance is already known or would be obvious 
to the hearer (who, of course, may or may not be attending to it). 
Note that the speaker may or may not believe that this information 
is known, in order to wish to convey this meaning. Particularly in 
pedagogical texts, this contour seems appropriate to introduce 
straightforward material, as in the following instruction to hit the 
remind key. 
Remind, tells you again what to do If you forget. 
R* L H~ tt* H* H* H* L L~ 
Hit re~ind. 
H*+L H*+L L L~ 
However, an H*+L sequence is not appropriate in the following 
similar exchange: 
I0. The standard example of accentuation influencing pronominal reference r solu- 
tion in this way is'john hit Bill and then HE hit HIM 1321. 
11. Propositional ttitudes include knowing, believing, intending, uncertainty, and 
ignorance. 
Next, let's erase hello. 
H* L H~ H* H* L L~ 
Hit hint. 
H* H* L L~ 
In general, such contours do not  seem felicitous when the 
utterance conveys information which the speaker believes will be 
unexpected for the hearer. Here tune choice may reflect atten- 
tional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure. 
Like the deaccenting of references to given items, t t *+L  sequence 
contours eem to convey 'givenness' at a more general level. 
Second, we believe that tune can convey the speaker's com- 
mitment o some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship hold- 
ing between the propositional content of utterances (as, that one 
'completes' another or is subordinate to another). Many such rela- 
tions have been proposed in textual analysis \[36,37,15\]. In the 
phonological literature, continuation rise has been commonly asso- 
ciated with some sense of 'continuation' or 'more to come' \[34\]. We 
have found, howe-rer, that this contour can be characterized more 
precisely as conveying a subordination relationship between the 
phrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in the 
discourse segment. For example, if the second phrase of line 1 is 
uttered with continuation rise, then this utterance appears to be 
subordinated to 2. 
I. We can't answer questions, if you are confused. 
H* H* H* L H~ H* L H~ 
2. We have to let the computer do all the teachlng. 
H* H* H* H* L L~ 
3. But if the computer is not working right, we will help 
H* H* L H~ H* H* 
you out. 
H* L L% 
That is, 2 'completes' I. Without continuation rise on 1, all three 
utterances will appear to have equal status in th'esegfiaent. Furth- 
ermore, continuation rise is not  felicitous in ~.ll ~ontexts in which 
the simple sense that 'there is more to come' clearly should be 
appropriate; for example, continuation rise over 3 -- at the end of 
the tutorial introduction -- seems quite odd, even though more will 
clearly follow. 
In synthesizing the TNT script, we have employed only a 
small subset of possible English tunes. Analysis of the 'meaning' of 
additional tunes is part of our future research. More generally, we 
must examine how structural relationships conveyed by tunes such 
as H*+L sequence are ~.ssociated with those conveyed by pitch 
range. 
We have described certain mappings between intonational 
features and discourse phenomena, associating pitch range varia- 
tion with the identification of discourse segments and with their 
internal coherence; accent with types of information status such as 
topic (focus) and the given/new distinction, with reference resolu- 
tion and with contrastiveness; and tune choice with~ ~he, relation- 
ships among propositions in the discourse as well as w~l~b.,~ome pro- 
positional attitude the speaker wishes to associate with :those pro- 
positions. It appears that pitch range and accent placement are 
most closely associated with a diseourse's attentional structure, 
while tune choice is more closely associated with its intentional 
structure. However, clearly this picture is too simple. SeverM into- 
national features may be used together to create some discourse 
effect; moreover, in some cases two distinct intonational 
phenomena seem to produce discourse ffects that seem intuitively 
to be closely related. And sometimes several discourse phenomena 
may indicate conflicting intonational strategies. These problems 
are the subject of our future research. 
5. D iscuss ion  
The central thesis of this work is that there are many ways 
in which intonation helps to structure discourse. By understanding 
the mapping between intonational phenomena and discourse 
phenomena, we can enhance both our ability to interpret what 
142 
speakers try to convey and to synthesize speech more effectively. 
We have described three major intonational phenomena -- pitch 
range, accent, and tune -- and some of the information they allow 
speakers to communicate about discourse, demonstrating some 
links between discourse and intonational phenomen~ which have 
not been noted in the literature and refining some notions which 
have. We also identify major issues which future research on the 
relationship between discourse and intonation must address, 
including a more precise mapping between discourse and intona- 
tional phenomena, the interaction of intonational phenomena to 
produce particular discourse ffects, and the way conflict between 
intonational strategies signaled by various aspects of the discourse 
may be resolved. 
We are currently testing and refining our hypotheses by 1) 
pitch tracking recorded natural discourse to determine pitch range 
manipulation, and 2) conducting pilot empirical studies of how 
principled manipulation of pitch range can affect reference resolu- 
tion. We are also examining in some detail the relationship between 
pronominalization a d deaccenting, pursuant o the development 
of better accenting algorithms for synthetic speech. Our ultimate 
goals are practical as well as theoretical. Once we have determined 
how particular intonational phenomena are related to particular 
discourse phenomena, the next step is to determine how these find- 
ings can be applied to natural-language neration. In particular, 
how much intonational structuring of generated text can be done 
automatically? What sorts of information must be represented to
support he assignment of rhetorically effective intonation?
