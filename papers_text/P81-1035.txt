I INTRODUCTION 
Over the last few years a number of 
application systems have been constructed that 
a l low users  to access  databases  by posing quest ions  
in natura l  languages, such as Eng l i sh .  When used 
in  the res t r i c ted  domains fo r  which they have been 
espec ia l l y  des igned,  these systems have achieved 
reasonably  high leve ls  of performance. Such 
systems as LADDER \[2\] ,  PLANES \[10\],  ROBOT \[1\],  
and REL \[9\] requ i re  the encoding of knowledge 
about the domain of app l i ca t ion  in such const ructs  
as database schemata, lex lcons ,  pragnmtic grammars, 
and the l l ke .  The c reat ion  of these data  
s t ruc tures  typ ica l ly  requ i res  cons iderab le  e f fo r t  
on the par t  of a computer p ro fess iona l  who has had 
special training in computational l i ngu is t i cs  and 
the use of databases. Thus, the utility of these 
systems is severely limited by the high cost 
involved in developing an interface to any 
particular database. 
This paper descr ibes  in i t ia l  work on a 
methodology for  c reat ing  natura l - language 
process ing  capab i l i t i es  for  new domains wi thout  the 
need for  in tervent ion  by spec ia l l y  t ra ined  exper ts .  
Our approach i s  to acqu i re  log ica l  schemata and 
lex ica l  in format ion  through s imple in teract ive  
d ia logues  with someone who i s  fami l ia r  w i th  the 
form and content  of the database ,  but un fami l ia r  
w i th  the technology of natura l - language in ter faces .  
To tes t  our approach in an ac tua l  computer 
environment,  we have developed a prototype system 
ca l led  TED (Transpor tab le  Eng l i sh  Datamanager).  As 
a resu l t  of our exper ience  with TED. the NL group 
a t  SRI i s  now under tak ing  the develop=ant of a ~ch  
more ambit ious  system based on the sane ph i losophy 
\ [4\] .  
I I  RESEARCH PROBLEMS 
Given the demonstrated feas ib i l i ty  of 
language-access  ystems,  such as LADDER, major 
research  i ssues  to be dea l t  w i th  in  ach iev ing  
t ranspor tab le  database in ter faces  inc lude  the 
fo l low ing:  
* In format ion  used by t ranspor tab le  systems 
must be c lean ly  d iv ided  into  database-  
independent and database-dependent  
por t ions .  
* Knowledge representat ions  must be 
es tab l i shed  for  the database-dependent  par t  
in  such a way that  the i r  form i s  f ixed and 
app l i cab le  to a l l  databases  and the i r  
content  read i ly  acqu i rab le .  
* Mechanisms must be developed to enable the 
system to acqu i re  information about a 
par t i cu la r  app l i ca t ion f rom non l ingu is ts .  
I I I  THE TED PROTOTYPE 
We have developed our prototype system (TED) 
to exp lore  one poss ib le  approach to chase problems. 
In essence ,  TED i s  a LADDER-like natura l - language 
process ing  system for  access ing  databases ,  combined 
with  an "automated in ter face  exper t "  that  
interviews users to learn the language and logical 
s t ructure  associated w i th  a par t i cu la r  database and 
that  automat ica l ly  ta i lo rs  the system for  use with 
the par t i cu la r  app l i ca t ion .  TED a l lows users  to 
c reate ,  popu la te ,  and ed i t  ~hei r  own new loca l  
databases ,  to descr ibe  ex is t ing  loca l  databases ,  or 
even to descr ibe  and subsequent ly  access  
heterogeneous (as in  \ [5\])  d i s t r ibuted  databases .  
Most of TED i s  based on and bu i l t  from 
components of LADDER. In par t i cu la r ,  TED uses the 
LIFER parser  and i t s  assoc ia ted  support  packages 
\[3\] ,  the SODA data  access  p lanner  \ [5\] ,  and the 
FAM f i l e  access  manager \ [6\] .  A l l  of these support  
packages are independent of the par t i cu la r  database 
used. In LADDER, the data s t ruc tures  used by these 
components ~re  hand-generated for  s par t i cu la r  
database by computer sc ient i s ts .  In TED, however, 
they are c reated  by TED's automated in ter face  
exper t .  
Like LADDER, TED uses a pragmat ic  granmar; but 
TED's pragmatic gramemr does not make any 
asstmpt lons  about the par t i cu la r  database being 
accessed.  I t  assumes only  that  in teract ions  wi th  
the system wi l l  concern data  access  or update,  and 
that  in format ion  regard ing  the par t i cu la r  database 
w i l l  be encoded in data  s t ruc tures  of a p rescr ibed  
form, which are c reated  by the automated in ter face  
exper t .  
The execut ive  leve l  of TED accepts  th ree  kinds 
of input :  quest ions  s ta ted  in  Eng l i sh  about the 
data  in  f i l es  that  have been prev ious ly  descr ibed  
to the system; quest ions  posed in  the SODA query 
language;  s ing le -~ord  commands that ~nltlaCe 
d ia logues  with the automated in ter face  exper t .

TED's mechanism for  acqu i r ing  in fo raat lon  
about a par t i cu la r  database app l i ca t ion  Is  to 
conduct in terv iews  wl th  users .  For such In terv lews  
to be successful, 
The work repor ted  here in  was supported by the Advanced Research Pro jec ts  Agency of the Department of Defense 
under contracts N00039-79-C-0118 and NOOO39-80-C-O6A5 wlth the Naval Electronic Systems Command. The views and

* There must  be a range  of  read i ly  unders tood  
quest ions  that  e l i c i t  a l l  the  in fo rmat ion  
needed about  a new database .  
* The quest ions  must  be both  br ie f  and easy  
to unders tand .  
* The sys tem must  appear  coherent ,  ellciting 
requ i red  information in an order  
comfor tab le  to  the  user .  
* The system must  prov ide  substant ia l  
ass i s tance ,  when needed,  to  enab le  a user  
to  unders tand  the  k inds  o f  responses  that  
a re  expected .  
A l l  these  po in ts  cannot  be covered  here in ,  but  the  
sample  t ranscr ip t  shown at  the  end of  th i s  paper t  
in conjunction with the following discussion, 
suggests  the  manner  o f  our  approach .  
B. S t ra tegy  
A key  s t ra teSy  o f  TED i s  to  f i r s t  acqu i re  
information about  the structure of files. Because 
the  semantics of files is relatively well 
understoodt the  system thereby lays the foundation 
for subsequently acqu i r ing  information about  the  
linguistic constructions likely to  be used in  
questions about the data contained in the file. 
One o f  the  s ing le -word  co - - - -nds  accepted  by 
the  TED execut ive  sys tem i s  the  command NEW, wh ich  
in i t ia tes  a d ia logue  prompt ing  the  user  to  supp ly  
in fo rmat ion  about  the  s t ructure  o f  a new data  f i l e .  
The NEW d ia logue  a l lows  the  user  to  th ink  o f  the  
f i l e  as  a tab le  o f  in fo rmat ion  and asks  re la t ive ly  
s imple  quest ions  about  each  o f  the  f ie lds  (co lumns)  
in the  file ( tab le ) .  
For example, TED asks for the heading names of 
the columns, for possible synonyms for the  heading 
names,  and  fo r  in fo rmat ion  about  the  types  o f  
va lues  (numer ic ,  Boo lean ,  o r  symbol i c )  that  each  
co lumn can  conta in .  The head ing  names genera l ly  
ac t  l i ke  re la t iona l  nouns ,  wh i le  the  in format ion  
about  the  type  o f  va lues  in  each  co lumn prov ides  a 
clue to the column's semantics. The heading name 
of a symbolic column tends to he the generic name 
fo r  the  c lass  o f  ob jec ts  re fer red  to  by  the  va lues  
o f  that  co lumn.  Head ing  names fo r  Boo lean  co lumns  
tend  co be the  names o f  p roper t ies  that  database  
ob jec ts  can possess. T.f a co lumn contains numbers, 
thls suggests that there may be some scale wlth 
assoc ia ted  ad jec t ives  of degree .  To a l low the  
sys tem to  answer  quest ions  requ i r ing  the  
in tegrat ion  of information from mult ip le  files, the  
user  i s  a l so  asked  about  the  in terconnect ions  
between the  f i l e  cur rent ly  be ing  def ined  and other  
f i l es  descr ibed  prev ious ly .  
C. Examples  f rom a Transcr ip t  
In  the  sample  t ranscr ip t  a t  the  end o f  th i s  
paper ,  the  user  in i t ia tes  a NEW d ia logue  at  Po in t  
A. The automated  in ter face  exper t  then  takes  the  
in i t ia t ive  in  the  conversat ion ,  ask ing  f i r s t  fo r  
the  name o f  the  new f i le ,  then  fo r  the  names o f  the  
file's fields. The file name wlll be used to  
dlstlngulsh the new file from others during the 
acquisition process. The field names are entered 
into the lexicon as the names of attributes and are 
put on an agenda so that further questions about 
the fields may be asked subsequently of the user. 
At this point, TED still does not know what 
type of objects the data in the new file concern. 
Thus, as its next task, TED asks for words that 
might be used as generic names for the subjects of 
the file. Then, at Point E, TED acquires 
Information about how to identify one of these 
sub jects  co the  user  and ,  a t  Po in t  F,  determines  
what  k inds  of  p ronouns  might  be used to  re fer  to  
one of  the  sub jects .  (As regards  sh ips ,  TED i s  
foo led ,  because  sh ips  may be re fer red  to  by "she . " )  
TED i s  p rogra - ,~ed wlch the knowledge that the 
identifier of an object must be some kind of name, 
ra ther  than  a numeric quant i ty  or  Boo lean  value. 
Thus, TED can assume a priori that the NAME field 
given in Interaction E is symbolic in nature. At 
Po int  G, TED acquires poss ib le  synonyms fo r  NAME. 
TED then  cyc les  through a l l  the  o ther  f ie lds ,  
acqu i r ing  in format ion  about  the i r  ind iv idua l  
semant ics .  At Po in t  H, TED asks  about  the  CLASS 
f ie ld ,  but  the  user  doesn ' t  unders tand  the  
quest ion .  By typ ing  a quest ion  eu ' rk ,  the  user  
causes  TED to  g ive  a more deta i led  exp lanat ion  o f  
what  i t  needs .  Every  quest ion  TED asks  has  a t  
leas t  two leve ls  of  exp lanat ion  that  a user  may 
ca l l  upon fo r  c la r i f i ca t ion .  For  example ,  the  user  
aga in  has  t roub le  a t  J ,  whereupon he rece ives  an  
extended exp lanat ion  w i th  an  example .  See T a l so .  
Depend ing  upon whether  a f ie ld  i s  symbol i c ,  
a r i thnet ic  o r  Boo lean ,  TED makes d i f fe rent  fo rms o f  
ent r ies  in  i t s  lex icon  and seeks  to  acqu i re  
d i f fe rent  types  o f  in fo rmat ion  about  the  f ie ld .  
For  example ,  as  a t  Po in ts  J ,  K and ? ,  TED asks  
whether symbolic field values can be used as 
modi f ie rs  (usually i n  noun-~oun combinat ions) .  For 
ar i thmet ic  f ie lds ,  TED looks  fo r  ad jec t ives  
assoc ia ted  w i th  sca les ,  as  i s  i l l us t ra ted  by the  
sequence  0PQR. Once TED has  a word such  as  OLD, i t  
assumes  MORE OLD, OLDER and OLDEST may a lso  be 
used .  (GOOD-BETTER-BEST requ i res  special 
i n tervent ion .  ) 
Note  the  aggress ive  use  of prev ious ly  acqu i red  
information i n  formulating new quest ions  to  the  
user (as in the use of AGE, and SHIP at Point P). 
We have found that this aids considerably in 
keep ing  the  user  focused  on the  cur rent  i tems of  
in teres t  co the  sys tem and he lps  to  keep 
in teract ions  br ie f .  
Once TED has  acqu i red  local i n fo rmat ion  about  
a new f i le ,  i t  seeks  to  re la te  i t  to  a l l  known 
files, including the  new file itself. At Po in ts  Z 
th rough B+, TED d iscovers  chat  the *SHIP* file may 
be Joined with itself. That is, one of the 
attrlbutes of a ship is yet another ship (the 
escorted shlp)j which may itself be described in 
the same file. The need for this information is 
i l l us t ra ted  by the  query  the  user  poses  a t  Po in t  
G+. 
TO bet ter  i l l us t ra te  l inkages  between f i l es ,  
the  t ranscr ip t  inc ludes  the  acqu is i t ion  o f  a second 
file about ship classes, beginnlng at Point J+ .  
Much of thls dialogue is omitted but ,  aC L?s TED 
l earns  there  i s  a l ink  between the  *SHIP* and  
*CLASS* files. At /4+ it l earns  the  d i rec t ion  of 
160 
th i s  l ink ;  a t  N+ and O+ i t  l earns  the f ie lds  upon 
which the Jo in  must be made; a t  P+ it l earns  the 
a t t r ibutes  inher i ted  through the llnk. This 
i n fo rmat ion  Is  used, for  example, In  answering the 
query at  S+. TED conver ts  the user ' s  quest ion  
"What I s  the speed of the hoel?"  in to  '~hat  i s  the 
speed of the c lass  whose CN~ i s  equal  to the 
CLASS of the hoe l? . "  
Of course ,  the whole purpose of the NEW 
d ia logues  i s  to make i t  poss ib le  for  users  to ask 
quest ions  of the i r  databases  in  Eng l i sh .  Examples 
of Eng l i sh  inputs  accepted by TED are shown at  
Po ints  E+ through I+, and S+ and T+ In the 
t ranscr ip t .  Note the use of noun-noun 
combinat ions ,  super la t ives  and ar i thmet ic .  
Although not i l l us t ra ted ,  TED a lso  supports  a l l  the 
available LADDER facilities of ellipsis, spelling 
cor rec t ion ,  run-time gram,~r extens ion  end 
in t rospect ion .  
V THE PRACHATIC GRAMMAR 
The pragmat ic  grammar used by TED inc ludes  
spec ia l  syntact i c / semant ic  a tegor ies  that  are 
acqu i red  by the NEW d ia logues .  In our ac tua l  
implementat ion,  these have ra ther  awkward names, 
but they correspond approx/macely to the fo l low ing :  
* <GENERIC> i s  the category  fo r  the gener ic  
names of the ob jec ts  in  f i l es .  Lex lca l  
p roper t ies  for  th i s  category inc lude  the 
name of the re levant  f i l e (s )  and the names 
of the f ie lds  that  can be used Co ident i fy  
one of the ob jec ts  to the user .  See 
t ranscr ip t  Po ints  D and E. 
* <ID.VALUE> is the category for the 
i dent i f ie rs  of sub jec ts  of ind iv idua l  
records  ( i .e . ,  key - f ie ld  va lues) .  For 
example, for  the *SHIP* f i l e ,  i t  conta ins  
the va lues  of the NAME f ie ld .  See 
t ranscr ip t  Point  E. 
* <MOD.VALUE> is  the category for the va lues  
of database fields that can serve as 
modi f ie rs .  See Po ints  J and K. 
* <NUM.ATTP.>, <SYM.ATTR>, and <BOOL.ATTP.> are 
n , - -er ic ,  symbol ic and Boolean a t t r ibutes ,  
respect ive ly .  They inc lude  the names of 
a l l  database f ie lds  and the i r  synonyms. 
* <+NUM.ADJ> i s  the category  for  ad jec t ives  
(e .g .  OLD) assoc ia ted  with numeric f ie lds .  
Lex lca l  p roper t ies  inc lude  the name of the 
assoc ia ted  f ie ld  and f l i es ,  as ve i l  as 
in fo rmat ion  regard ing  whether the ad jec t ive  
i s  assoc ia ted  with greater  (as In OLD) or 
lesser  (as in  YOUNG) va lues  in  the f ie ld .  
See Po ints  P, Q and R. 
* <COMP.ADJ> and <SUPERLATIVE> are der ived  
f ro= <+NUM.ADJ>. 
Shown below are some i l lus t ra t ive  pragmat ic  
product ion  ru les  for  non lex lca l  ca tegor ies .  As in  
the forego ing examples,  these are not exact ly  the 
ru les  used by TED, but they do convey the unCure of 
the approach.  
<S> -> <PRESENT> THE <ATTP.> OF <ITEM> 
what is the age of the reeves 
HOW <+NUM.ADJ> <BE> <ITEM> 
how old i s  the youngest sh ip  
<WHDET> <ITEM> <HAVE> <FEATURE> 
what leahy sh ips  have a doctor  
<WHDET> <ITEM> <BE> <COMPLEMENT> 
which sh ips  are o lder  then reeves 
<PRESENT> -> WHAT <BE> 
PRINT 
<ATrR> -> <NUM.ATTR> 
<SYM.ATTR> 
<BOOL.ATTK> 
<ITEM> -> <GENERIC>

<ID.VALUE>

<NUM.COMP> -> <COMP.ADJ> THAN 
OF 
(GREATER> THAN 
<COMPLEMENT> -> <COMP.A/kJ> THAN <ITEM> 
<COMP.ADJ> THAN <NUMBER> 
These pragmat ic  Era-mar ru les  are very much 
l i ke  the ones used in LADDER \ [2\] ,  but they d i f fe r  
from those of LADDER in  two c r i t i ca l  ways. 
(1) They capture  the pragmat ics  of access ing  
databases  wi thout  fo rc ib ly  ?ncludin8 
in format ion  about the praSmatics of any 
one par t i cu la r  se t  of data .  
(2) They use s~tsc t4~/semant ic  a tegor ies  
that  support  the processes  of accessln8 
databases ,  but that  are  domsin- 
independent and eas i ly  acqu i rab le .  
I t  is  worth not ing  that ,  even when a psrC lcu la r  
app l i ca t ion  requ i res  the in t roduct ion  of Spec ia l -  
purpose ru les ,  the  bas ic  pragmat lc  grmamar used by 
TED prov ides  a s ta r t ing  po in t  from whlch domain- 
spec i f i c  features  can be added. 
VI DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK 
The TED system represents  a f i r s t  s tep  toward 
t ru ly  por tab le  natura l - language in ter faces  to 
database systems.  TED i s  only  a prototype,  
however, and --,ch add i t iona l  work w i l l  be requ i red  
161 
to provide adequate syntact ic  and conceptual 
coverage, as well as to increase the ease with 
which systems may be adapted to new databases. 
A severe limitation of the current TED system 
i s  i t s  res t r i c ted  range of syntact i c  coverage.  For 
example, TED dea ls  only w i th  the verbs BE and HAVE, 
and does not know about un i t s  (e .g . ,  the Waddel 's  
age i s  15.5, not 15.5 YEARS). To remove th i s  
l im i ta t ion ,  the SRI NL group i s  cur rent ly  adapt ing  
Jane Robinson's  extens ive  DIAGRAM grammar {7\] fo r  
use in  a successor  Co TED. In p reparat ion  fo r  the 
la t te r ,  we are  exper iment ing  wi th  verb acqu is i t ion  
dialogues such as the following: 
> VERB 
P lease  con jugate  the verb 
(e.g. fly flew flown) > EARN EARNED EARNED 
EARN is: 
1 in t rans i t i ve  (John d ines)  
2 t rans i t i ve  (John eats  d inner )  
3 d ic rans i t i ve  (John cooks Mary d inner )  
(Choose the most genera l  pat tern)  > 2 
who or what is EARNED? > A SALARY 
who or what EARNS A SALARY? > AN EMPLOYEE 
can A SALARY be EARNED by AN EMPLOYEE? > YES 
can A SALARY EARN? > NO 
can AN ~dPLOYEE EARN? > NO 
Ok:, an EMPLOYEE can EARN a SALARY 
What database field identifies an EMPLOYEE? > NAME 
What database field identifies a SALARY? > SALARY 
extensive conceptual and symtacclc coverage 
continues to pose a challenge to research, a 
polished version of the TED proto type ,  even with 
i t s  limited coverage, would appear to have high 
potential as a useful tool for data access.

The greates t  cha l lenge  to extend ing  systems

As po inted  out by Tennant \ [8\] ,  umers who are  
accorded natura l - language access co a database 6. 
expect  not only  to re t r ieve  in fo rmat ion  d i rec t ly  
s to red  there ,  but a l so  co compute " reasonab le"  
der ivat ive  in fo rmat ion .  For example,  i f  a database  
has the location of two ships, users will expect 
the  system to be ab le  to prov ide  the d i s tance  
between them--an i tem of i n fo rmat ion  not d i rec t ly  7. 
recorded in  the database ,  but eas i ly  computed from 
the existing data. In general, any system that is 
tO be wide ly  accepted by users  must not only 
provide access to primary information, but uast 
a lso  enhance the la t te r  w i th  procedures  that  8. 
ca lcu la te  secondary a t t r ibutes  from the data  
ac tua l ly  s to red .  Data enhancement procedures  a re  
cur rent ly  prov ided by LADDER and a few other  hand- 
bu i l t  systems,  but work i s  needed now to  dev ise  
means for  a l low ing  system users  to spec i fy  the i r  
own database  enhancement functions and to couple 9. 
these  wlth the natural-language component. 
A second issue assoc iated with conceptual  
coverage i s  the ab i l i ty  to access  in fo rmat ion  
ext r ins ic  to the database  per  se,  such as where the 
data  are s to red  and how the f ie lds  are  de f ined ,  as 10. 
well as information about the s ta tus  of the query 
system itself. 
In summary, systems such as LADDER are  of 
l im i ted  u t i l i ty  un less  they can be t ranspor ted  to 
new databases  by people  w i th  no s ign i f i cant  formal
