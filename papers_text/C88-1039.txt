Abstract 
Much work in current research in the field of semantic - 
pragmatic analysis has been concerned with the interpre- 
tation of natural anguage utterances in the context of 
dialogs. In this paper, however, we will present methods 
for a primary pragmatic analysis of single utterances. Our 
investigations involve problems which are not currently 
well understood, for example how to infer the speaker's 
intentions by using interpretation of connectives and 
modal verbs. 
This work k,; part of the joint project WlSBER which is 
supported by the German Federal Ministery for Research 
and Technology. The partners in the project are: Nixdorf 
Computer AG, SCS GmbH, Siemens AG, the University of 
Hamburg and the University of Saarbrticken. 
Introduction 
Much work in current research in the field of semantic - 
pragmatic analysis has been concerned with the inter- 
pretation of ~Latural language utterances in the context of 
dialogs, e.g., determining the speaker's goals \[Allen 83\], 
deriving beliefs of one agent about another \[Wilks/Bien 
83\], and planning speech acts \[Appelt 85\]. In this paper, 
however, we will present methods for a primary pragmatic 
analysis of ,~Jingle utterances to construct user model 
entries which are the starting point for the higher level 
inference processes just mentioned. Our investigations 
involve problems which are not currently well understood, 
for example, how to infer the speaker's intentions by using 
interpretation f connectives and modal verbs. 
Our work is a part of the natural anguage consultation 
system WISllER \[Bergmann/Gerlach 87\]. Consultation 
dialogs require a much wider class of utterances to be 
understood than other applications (e.g., for data base 
interface). In advisory dialogs wants and beliefs play a 
central role. Although a consultation system must be 
capable of handling the linguistic means which are used 
for expressing those attitudes, problems of how to treat 
modal verbs have received little attention in artificial 
intelligence and computational linguistics. 
The interpretation processes described in this paper work 
with our aemantic representation !anguage IRS \[Berg- 
mann et. al. 87\] and generate ntries for the user model 
Representations of utterances in IRS still contain uninter 
preted linguistic features uch as modal verbs, modal 
hedges, connectives, and tense information. We are pre 
senting methods for deriving the meaning of these features 
as they occur in utterances: transforming idiomatically- 
used indirect speech acts, interpreting connectives in 
compound sentences, and resolving ambiguities in the 
meaning of modal verbs by using, i.a., temporal 
restrictions. The last chapter sketches the technical means 
used by these processes, i.e., the semantic representation 
language, the way rules are encoded, and the asscrtional 
knowledge base containing the user model. 
Fig. 1 shows the different stages of the interpretation 
process. First, if a connective is found, the analysis process 
breaks up the sentence into separate propositions, in the 
next step idomatically-used indirect speech acts are 
transformed into a direct question. The propositions are 
then interpreted independently during the modal verb 
analysis which creates one or more propositional ttitudes 
for each proposition. These interpretations arc then 
related, depending on the natural anguage connective. 
Finally, after inferring the appropriate time intervals 
from verb tense, the sentence type is used to derive the 
propositional ttitudes which are entered into the user 
model. 
T rans format ion  of Id iomat ica l ly -Used Ind i rec t  
Speech Acts 
Speakers often use indirect speech acts because they want 
to express politeness or uncertainty. Examples are : "Could 
you please tell me which bonds have the highest interest 
rate?", "i'd like to know which...", "I do not know which...." 
We believe that for appropriately handling such an 
idiomatic use of indirect speech acts in a consultation 
system it is admissible to transform such utterances into a 
simplified form - the corresponding direct quest;~n. 
Therefore the first step in our semantic-pragmatic inter- 
pretation is mapping the different ways of asking 
questions onto one standard form which is the formal 
representation f the equivalent direct question. 
Fig. 2 shows the ru~e which applies to the idiom "I do not 
know whether X." and transforms it into the represen 
tation of the direct speech act "X ?" The rule formalism will 
be described in detail ater.

Durin$" that transformation process we do not loose any 
information which might be relevant to the dialog control 
component of the system (not described in this paper). 
Before answering any question - direct or indirect - the 
system has to check whether it is able to answer that 
question. If this is not the ease the user must be informed 
about the limitations of the system's competence, anyway. 
This argumentation is similar to that of \[Ellman 83\], who 
argues that it is not relevant whether an utterance is a 
request or an inform as long as the hearer can detect he 
speaker's superordinate goals.

The transformation of indirect speech acts works on the 
semantic level by applying rules which specify formal 
transformations of semantic representations of sentences. 
In this our approach differs from that taken in UC 
\[Wilensky et. al. 84 and ZernikfDyer 85\] where a phrasal 
lexicon is used and the semantic interpretation f idioms is 
done during the parsing process. 
Interpretat ion of Modal Verbs 
An adequate treatment of modal verbs is necessary for 
determining the attitudes of the speaker concerning the 
state of affairs expressed by the proposition he is assert- 
ing. 1) The main problem in interpreting modal verbs is 
their typical ambiguity, e.g., 
(1) Mein Sohn sod viel Geld haben. 
In English the two readings are: 
'My son is supposed to have a lot of money.' 
VS. 
'I want my son to have a lot of money.' 
Our rules for disambiguating the different readings are 
based on information which is stored in the semantic 
representation of the utterance: information about 
semantic ategories of the subject of the modal verb (e.g., 
ANIMATE, GENERIC, DEFINIT\]O, the relation between the 
time expressed by the modal verb and the time of the pro- 
position and whether the proposition denotes a state or an 
event. 
(2) Ich habe 10000 Mark geerbt und m6chte das Geld ir~ 
Wertpapieren anlegem Sic sollen eine Laufzeit yon 
vier Jahren haben. 
'I have inherited 10000 Marks and would like to 
invest he money in securities.' 
Two readings of the second sentence: 
"they are supposed to have a term of fbur yea,'s.' 
VS. 
Whey should have a term of four years.' 
In the first reading of the second sentence the entry for the 
user model must contain the proposition embedded in a 
belief context, while the second reading must lead to an 
entry under speaker's wants. In order to resolve this 
ambiguity, the rules compare the time of the proposition 
with the tense of the modal verb. For example, if the tense 
of the modal verb is present and the time of the proposition 
is sometime in the future, the system decides that the 
"want" reading is appropriate. The problem in our example 
is to determine the time of the proposition: We have only 
the information of tense haben (to have) which is a present 
infinitive and might also denote a future state. Hence the 
system tries to final out whether the object of the propo- 
sition appears in a Want context of the speaker. This is the 
case as is clear from the previous utterance ... and I wan$ to 
invest the money in securities and therefore the ~y~tem 
decides to put the propesition of the ~c~nd sent~t~e into 
the user's want  ~ontext as well. (Even if the second 
utterance is taken to be a belief of the ~peaker, the fact 
that it is cited in this context is sufficient to infer that it is 
also a want, why else should the speaker cite this fact in 
connection with his decision to invest in securities?) 
1) For the semantics of English modal verbs, which is 
quite different from the German, see \[Boyd/Thorne 69\]. 
For German modal verbs see \[Brttnner/Redder 83\], 
\[Rei~wvin 77\], \[Spr~nge r 88\]. 
Usually the user's questions are interpreted as user wants 
to knowp (or more formally: (WANT USER (KNOW USER P))), 
where ~ th;notes the propositional content of the question. 
For example, 
(3) K0nnen Pfandbriefe mehr als 7% Rendite haben? 
'C~n bonds have an interest rate of more then 7%?' 
is interpreted as: the user wants to know whether the 
proposition is true, which means in our example, taking 
into account he modal verbk6nnen, whether it is possible 
for bonds to have an interest rate ofmore then 7 %. 
One problem arises when the modal verb sollen occurs in a 
question. Normally it is interpreted as indicating a want, 
e.g., 
(4) Soil ich das Fenster schliegen? 
'l\]hould I close the window?' 
Here the speaker wants to know, whether there is some 
other pers~m (probably the hearer), who wants the propo- 
sition to be true. But this interpretation doesn't make any 
sense in a consulting dialog. Ina  consultation the speaker 
is not interested in the wants of the advisor, e.g., 
(5) Soll ich Pfandbriefe mit 5% Rendite kaufen? 
'l~hould I buy bonds which have an interest rate 
of 5 %?' 
Rather than inquiring about someone lse's wants, as in 
(4), the speaker is interested in a recommendation: 
(WANT USER (KNOW USER (I~,ECOMMI,IND SYSTEM P~) 
The interpretation of modal verbs is further infiuet~ood by 
eonnectiw~;; which may occur in complements. Consider 
the following sentence: 
(6) Meine Sehwester mug viel Geld habcn. 
'My sister nmst have a lot of money.' 
In this case one can only infer that the speaker bo!ieves 
that the proposition is true, namely that his sister has a lot 
of money. The interpretation completely changes when we 
have: 
(7) Meine Schwester mug viel Geld haben, um th~ Haus 
zu bauen. 
':My sister needs to have a lot of money in order to 
bnild her house.' 
It is possible that the speaker believes as in (6) that his 
sister has s lot of money, but this cannot be inferred from 
the statement. Here we can only infer that the speaker 
believes that the second proposition (his sister's building 
her house) implies the first one (his sister's having a lot of 
money). 
Connect ivos  
Connective~ are a means of expressing the argumentative 
and logical structure of the speaker's opinions by linking' 
propositions. Such relations between proposit ions are 
classified into severa l  categories uch as inferential ,  
temporal, causal l inkages \[Cohen 84 and Br6e/Smit 86\]. 
The system interprets underlying beliefs and wants and 
enters them into the user nmdel in accordance with the 
different classes of connectives. 
As an example, take the class of connectives which express 
inferences of the speaker, e.g., 
(8) Ich will eine Anlage mit kurzer Laufzeit, damit ich 
schnell an mein Geld herankommen kann. 
'i want a short term investment so that I can get 
my money back quickly.' 
Because of the connective damit the system concludes that 
the proposition of the second part of the sentence is the 
superordinate goal rather than the first proposition al- 
though this is the want which is expressed irectly. The 
user supposes that the first proposition is a necessary 
condition for the second, which expresses his goal. When 
further processing this logical structure, the system can 
recognize the underlying misconception, amely that it is 
not the term of an investment which is important for 
getting the money back quickly, but the liquidity. 
The interpretation of connectives depends on the occur~ 
rence of modal verbs, as the following examples demon- 
strate: 
(9) Soll ich meine Wertpapiere verkaufen, urn racine 
Hypothek ztt bezahlen? 
'Should I sell my securities to pay off my mort- 
gage?' 
(10) Muff ich Gebtihren bezahlen, um mein Sparbuch 
aufzulhsen? 
'Do I have to pay a fee to desolve my savings 
account? q 
In (9) the modal verb sollen inside the question indicates 
that the user wants a recommendation. It indicates further 
that the connective um-zu has to be interpreted as a user's 
want. The correct interpretation is that the user wants to 
know whether the system would recommend that the user 
attempts to attain a certain goal (paying off his mortgage) 
by selling his securities. 
Such a want is not inferrable from (10). It may be that the 
user wants to desotve his savings account at somc time in 
the future, but the modal verb mtissen (must) inside the 
question does not indicate a current want. Therefore only 
the relation between the two propositions is the focus of 
attention. Hence we can paraphrase the user's want as 'Do 
I have to pay a fee if I want to desolve my savings 
account?', or, again more formally, 
(WANT USER (KNOW USER (IMPLIES P2 PLY)), 
where P2 denotes the desolving event and P1 the fee 
paying. 
The Computat iona l  Model 
The processes described in this paper work on a formal 
representation of utterances which reflects their semantic 
structure but also contains lexical and syntactic informa- 
tion (hedges, connectives, modal verbs, tense, and mood) 
which has not yet been interpreted. Our formal representa- 
t ion language is cal led IRS ( Interne Reprt isenta-  
tionsSprache, \[Bergmann et. al. 87\]). It contains all the 
standard operators of predicate calculus, formalisms for 
expressing propositional attitudes, modalities, and speech 
acts, natural  language connectives (and. or ,  however, 
therefore, etc.), a rich collection of natura/!anguage quant- 
ifiers (e.g., articles, wh-particles), and modal operators 
(maybe, necessarily).

Fig. 3 shows a part of the syntax definition of IRS and the 
representation f the sentence 
(6) Die Wertpapiere sollen eine Laufzeit yon vier 
Jahren haben 
'The securities hould/are supposed to have a 
term of four years.' 
This example contains some important features of IRS: 
Only one- and two-place predicates are allowed. They 
correspond to the concepts and roles defined in our 
terminological knowledge base QUIRK \[Bergmann/ 
Gerlach 86\] except for SOLLEN and HAS-TENSE which 
still need to be semantically interpreted. 
Quantifications are always restricted to a range which 
may be described by an arbitrary formula. 
The operator PROP allows for associating a variable to a 
formula. In subsequent terms the variable may be used 
as a denotation of the proposition expressed by that 
formula. 
In the formula given in Fig. 3 the variable A1 denotes the 
assertion as an action with agent USER and propositional 
content P1. $1 reflects the occurrence of the modal verb 
sollen which is represented like a predicate, but has not yet 
been semantically interpreted. The "propositional content" 
of S1 is P2 which denotes the proposition the securities have 
a term offouryears.  
For characterizing sets of structures to which one specific 
interpretation may apply, we use IRS patterns\[Gerlach 
87\], i.e., highly parameterized semantic structures which 
specify an arbitrary combination of features relevant o 
the interpretation process: The surface speech act, tense 
information, modal hedges, and restrictions on the 
propositional content. 
194, 
A quite simple example for an IRS pattern is given in 
Fig. 4. Its elements are 
variables (symbols starting with '?'), 
constants (all other symbols), 
a concept pattern (matching any one-place predication), 
role patterns (matching two-place predications). 
(AND (?INFO-TRANS-TYPE ?INFO-TRANS) 
(HAT-SOURCE ?INFO-TRANS USER) 
(HAT-GOAL ?INFO-TRANS SYS) 
(HAT-OBJ ECT ?INFO-TRANS ?OBJ ECT)) 
Fig. 4: An IRS pattern 
This pattern is used for matching the top level of the 
representation f an utterance of the user, directed to the 
system. When matching the variable ?OBJECT is bound to 
the whole propositional content of the utterance and is 
used by the subsequent steps of analysis. 
As described above, we do not only infer new user model 
information directly, but also perform transformations on 
IRS structures, e.g., to reduce idioms to more primitive 
speech acts. This kind o? processing involves applying aset 
oftransformatlonal rules to an IRS formula where a rule is 
a pair of IRS patterns as described above (for an example, 
see Fig. 2). When instantiating the right hand side of the 
rule the interpreter will create new variables for unbound 
pattern variables and quantify them in the appropriate 
way (in Fig. 2 this is the case with the pattern variable ?Q). 
In WISBER the user model is a section of the central asser- 
tional knowledge base (A-Box, \[Poesio 88\]) which allows 
for storing and retrieving assertional knowledge in differ- 
ent contexts which denote the content of propositional tti- 
tudes of agents. Hence a new entry is added to the user 
model by storing the propositional content in the A-Box 
context which contains the user's wants. 
Conclusior~ 
We have implemented our interpretation module in an 
Interlisp programming environment. I  is a part of the 
natural lahguage consultation '~ystem WISBER. The 
module's coverage includes all German modal verbs occur- 
ing in assections and questions, ome connectives (e.g., 
? and, so that, because) and the most common indirect 
questions. On the one hand our future work will 
concentrate on extending the performance of the system 
inside the framework which is described in this paper. On 
the other hand we will integrate the concept of expecta- 
tions, i.e. expectations the system has according to the 
users next utterance depending on the actual state of the 
dialog. Thi~ will enable us to resolve more kinds of ambi- 
guities in user utterances.
