Abstract
A drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurs when
one drug affects the level or activity of another
drug. Semeval 2013 DDI Extraction challenge
is going to be held with the aim of identify-
ing the state of the art relation extraction algo-
rithms. In this paper we firstly review some of
the existing approaches in relation extraction
generally and biomedical relations especially.
And secondly we will explain our SVM based
approaches that use lexical, morphosyntactic
and parse tree features. Our combination of
sequence and tree kernels have shown promis-
ing performance with a best result of 0.54 F1
macroaverage on the test dataset.
1 Introduction
A drug-drug interaction occurs when one drug af-
fects the level or activity of another drug, for in-
stance, drug concentrations. This interaction can
result on reducing its effectiveness or possibly in-
creasing its side effects (Stockley, 2007). There are
some helpful DDIs but most of them are danger-
ous (Aronson, 2007), for example, patients that take
clarithromycin and glibenclamide concurrently may
experiment hypoglycaemia.
There is a great amount of information about DDI
described in papers that health experts have to con-
sult in order to be updated. The development of tools
for extracting this type of information from biomed-
ical texts would produce a clear benefit for these pro-
fessionals reducing the time necessary to review the
literature. Semeval 2013 DDI Extraction challenge
decided to being held with the aim of identifying the
state of the art algorithms for automatically extract-
ing DDI from biomedical articles. This challenge
has two tasks: recognition and classification of drug
names and extraction of drug-drug interactions. For
the second task, the input corpus contains annota-
tions with the drug names.
A previous Workshop on Drug-Drug Interaction
Extraction (Segura-Bedmar et al, 2011) was held
in 2011 in Huelva, Spain. The main difference is
that the new challenge includes the classification of
the drug-drug interactions in four types depending
on the information that is described in the sentence
making the task much more complicated than be-
fore. Additionally the current task involves DDIs
from two different corpora with different character-
istics (Segura-Bedmar et al, 2013).
We participated in the task of extracting drug-drug
interactions with two approaches that exploit a rich
set of tree and sequence features. Our implemented
methods utilize a SVM classifier with a linear ker-
nel and a rich set of lexical, morphosyntactic and se-
mantic features (e.g. trigger words) extracted from
texts. In addition some tree features such as shortest
path and subtree features are used.
2 Related work
Due to the importance of detecting biological and
medical relations several methods have been applied
for extracting biological relation information from
text. In (Song et al, 2010) is presented a method for
extracting protein-protein interaction (PPI) through
combination of an active learning technique and a
semi-supervised SVM.
Another motivating work can be found in (Chen et
644
al., 2011) in which a PPI Pair Extractor was devel-
oped that consists of a SVM for binary classification
which exploits a linear kernel with a rich set of fea-
tures based on linguistic analysis, contextual words,
interaction words, interaction patterns and specific
domain information.
Another PPI extraction method have been devel-
oped in (Li et al, 2010). They have applied an en-
semble kernel composed of a feature-based kernel
and a structure-based kernel. A more recent research
on tree kernels has been carried out by (Guodong
et al, 2010). They have introduced a context-
sensitive convolution tree kernel, which specifies
both context-free and context-sensitive sub-trees by
taking into account the paths of their ancestor nodes
as their contexts to capture structural information in
the tree structure. A recent work (Simo?es et al,
2013) has introduced an approach for Relationship
Extraction (RE) based on labeled graph kernels. The
proposed kernel is a specification of a random walk
kernel that exploits two properties: the words be-
tween the candidate entities and the combination of
information from distinct sources. A comparative
survey regarding different kernel based approaches
and their performance can be found in (Frunza and
Inkpen, 2008).
Using external knowledge and resources to the
target sentence is another research direction in the
relation extraction task that Chan and Roth have
investigated in (Chan and Roth, 2010). They
have reported some improvements by using exter-
nal sources such as Wikipedia, comparing to basic
supervised learning systems. Thomas and his col-
leagues in (Thomas et al, 2011) have developed
a majority voting ensemble of contrasting machine
learning methods using different linguistic feature
spaces.
A more systematic and high quality investigation
about feature selection in kernel based relation ex-
pression can be found in (Jiang and Zhai, 2011).
They have explored a large space of features for re-
lation extraction and assess the effectiveness of se-
quences, syntactic parse trees and dependency parse
trees as feature subspaces and sentence representa-
tion. They conclude that, by means of a set of ba-
sic unit features from each subspace, a reasonably
good performance can be achieved. But when the
three subspaces are combined, the performance can
slightly improve, which shows sequence, syntactic
and dependency relations have much overlap for the
task of relation extraction.
Although most of the previous researches in
biomedical domain has been carried out with respect
to protein-protein interaction extraction, and more
recently on drug-drug interaction extraction, other
types of biomedical relations are being studied: e.g.
gene-disease (Airola et al, 2008), disease-treatment
(Jung et al, 2012) and drug-disease.
3 Dataset
The dataset for the DDIExtraction 2013 task con-
tains documents from two sources. It includes Med-
Line abstracts and documents from the DrugBank
database describing drug-drug interactions (Segura-
Bedmar et al, 2013). These documents are anno-
tated with drug entities and with information about
drug pair interactions: true or false.
In the training corpus the interaction type is also
annotated. There are 4 types of interactions: effect,
mechanism, int, advice.
The challenge corpus is divided into training and
evaluation datasets (Table 1). The DrugBank train-
ing data consists of 572 documents with 5675 sen-
tences. This subset contains 12929 entities and
26005 drug pair interactions. On the other hand, the
MedLine training data consists of 142 abstracts with
1301 sentences, 1836 entities and 1787 pairs.
The distribution of positive and negative exam-
ples are similar in both subsets, 12.98% of positives
instances on MedLine and 14.57% on DrugBank.
With respect to the distribution of categories, the fig-
ures show that there is a small number of positive
instances for categories int and advice on the Med-
Line subset. The effect type is the most frequent,
outmatching itself on the MedLine subset.
The evaluation corpus contains 158 abstracts with
973 sentences and 5265 drug pair interactions from
Drugbank, and 33 abstracts with 326 sentences and
451 drug pair interactions from Medline. It is worth
to emphasize that the distribution of positive and
negative examples is a bit greater (2.22%) in the
DrugBank subset compared to the training data, but
is almost doubled with respect to MedLine (12,98%
to 21,06%). The categories advice and int have very
few positive instances in the MedLine subset.

4 Method
Initially several experiments have been developed to
explore the performance of shallow linguistic (SL)
and parse tree based methods on a subset of the train-
ing corpus. Although the SL kernel achieved consid-
erably good results we have found that the best op-
tion was the combination of different kernels using
linguistic and tree features.
Our implemented kernel based approach consists
of four different processes that have been applied se-
quentially: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature
selection and classification (Figure 1). Our two sub-
mitted results were obtained by two different strate-
gies. In the first outcome, all the DDIs and type of
interactions were extracted in one step, as a 5-class
categorization problem. The second run was carried
out in two steps, initially the DDIs were detected and
then the positively predicted DDIs were used to de-
termine the type of the interaction. In the next sub-
section the four different processes are described.
4.1 Preprocessing
In this phase we have carried out two types of text
preprocessing steps before training the classifier.
We have removed some stop words in special
places in the sentences that clearly were a matter of
concern and caused some inaccuracy, for example,
removing question marks at the beginning of a sen-
tence. We also carried out a normalization task for
some tokens because of usage of different used en-
codings and processing methods, mainly html tags.
4.2 Feature extraction
Initially 49 feature classes were extracted for each
instance that correspond to a drug pair interaction
between Drug1 and Drug2:
? Word Features: Include Words of Drug1, words
of Drug2, words between Drug1 and Drug2,
Figure 1: The different processes followed for our two
submitted results.
three words before Drug1 and three words after
Drug2. Lemmas and stems of all these words.
We have used TreeTagger to obtain lemmas and
Paice/Husk Stemmer (Paice, 1990) to obtain
stems.
? Morphosyntactic Features: Include Part-of-
speech (POS) tags of each drug words (Drug1
and Drug2), POS of the previous 3 and next 3
words. We have used TreeTagger.
? Constituency parse tree features: Include short-
est path between Drug1 and Drug2 in the con-
stituency parse tree, shortest path between first
token in the sentence and Drug1, and shortest
path between Drug2 and last token in the sen-
tence in the parse tree, and all subtrees gener-
646
ated from the constituency parse tree. We have
used Stanford parser 1 for producing tree fea-
tures.
? Conjunction features: We have produced some
new conjunction features by combination of
different word features and morphosyntactic
features such as POSLEMMA and POSSTEM
for all the words before Drug1, words between
Drug1 and Drug2 and words after Drug2.
? verbs features: Include verbs between Drug1
and Drug2, first verb before Drug1 and first
verb after Drug2. Their stem, lemma and their
conjunction features are also included.
? negation features: Only if the sentence contains
negation statements. The features extracted in-
clude the left side tokens of the negation scope,
the right side tokens of the negation scope and
the tokens inside the negation scope. We have
used NegEx2 as negation detection algorithm.
Finally we have deployed a bag of words ap-
proach (BoW) for each feature class in order to ob-
tain the final representation for each instance. We
have limited the size of the vocabulary in the BoW
representation with a different number depending on
the data subset. We carried out several experiments
to fix these numbers and at the end we have used
1000 words/feature class for MedLine and 6000
words/feature class for DrugBank.
4.3 Feature selection
We have conducted some feature selection experi-
ments to select the best features for improving the
results and reducing running time. We have finally
used Information Gain ranker to eliminate the less
effective features. We have computed the informa-
tion gain for each feature class as the linear combi-
nation of the information gain of each corresponding
word. Empirically we have selected the best 42 fea-
ture classes.
On the other hand, we have done a preliminary
study of the effect of the negation related features.
We have found more than 3000 sentences contain-
ing negation, most of them corresponds to sentences
1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml
2http://code.google.com/p/negex/
associated with negative examples of interactions.
However, these features have been eliminated be-
cause we have not obtained a clear improvement
when we combined them with the other features.
4.4 Classification
First we have performed several experiments with
different supervised machine learning approaches
such as SVM, Naivebayes, Randomtree, Random
forest, Multilayer perceptron in addition to combina-
tion of methods. Finally we decided to use a SVM
approach, the Weka Sequential Minimal Optimiza-
tion (SMO) algorithm. We used the inner product of
the BoW vectors as similarity function.
We have submitted two approaches:
? approach 1: SVM (Weka SMO) with 5 cate-
gories (effect, mechanism, int, advice and null).
? approach 2: We have extracted final results in
two stages. In the first step we have used a
SVM (Weka SMO) with 2 categories (positive
and negative) and then we have used a second
SVM classifier with 4 classes on positive ex-
tracted DDIs to train and extract the type of in-
teraction in the test dataset.
The classifiers have been applied separately with
each data subset, that is, a classifier per approach has
been developed using the DrugBank training subset
and has been evaluated using the DrugBank test sub-
set, and the same process has been applied with the
MedLine training and test subset.
5 Results
In this section we first show the evaluation results
with our two approaches. Secondly an error analy-
sis was carried out with a development set extracted
from the training corpus.
5.1 Test data results
We have submitted two runs that corresponds with
the approaches described in the previous section.
Table 2 shows the results obtained with the first ap-
proach (one step) and Table 3 shows the results with
the second approach (two steps).
It can be observed that the results on detection of
DDI are better with the approach 2: 0.656 against
0.588 on F1. This result is a consequence that we

have more information to obtain the detection of the
interaction if we use the information from all the dif-
ferent types than if we obtain it joining the results
obtained per each category. With respect to detec-
tion and classification the results are also better with
approach 2 for a similar reason: 0.548 against 0.517
on F1.
With respect to the categories, in the more pop-
ulated ones the general tendency of better results
from approach 2 continues, especially in effect type:
0.556 against 0.489. With respect to advice and int,
the recall is better in approach 2 but the improve-
ment in precision is greater in approach1 giving a
better result on F1 to approach 1, especially in int
type: 0.427 against 0.393.
Table 4 shows the macroaverage results separated
by subset data. The best results obtained for ap-
proach 1 are due to that this type of average gives
equal weight to each category, favouring then the
categories with less instances.
Other important insight that can be extracted from
this table is that our results are much better for Drug-
Bank dataset with both approaches. These results
can be justified due to high similarity between sen-
tences in Drugbank training and test corpus. In fact
the Medline corpus commonly has more words un-
related to DDI subjects. In addition to this argument,
the smaller number of training pairs in the Medline
corpus can be other reason to obtain worst results.
5.2 Error analysis
We have extracted a stratified development corpus
from the training corpus in order to perform an error
analysis. We have used a 10% of the training corpus.
It contains 2779 pairs, of which 397 are DDIs. Table
5 shows the results obtained with the two submitted
approaches.
The results with our development corpus shows
the same tendency, that is, approach 2 is better than
approach 1 on detection of DDI and on microav-
erage classification. On the other hand, results are
higher than those on test corpus because the infor-
mation contained in the development corpus is more
similar to the rest of training corpus than informa-
tion on the test set.
We have performed an analysis of the errors pro-
duced for both approaches in the Detection and
Classification of DDI subtask. The errors obtained
are 112 false positives (Fp) and 116 false negatives
(Fn) associated to approach 1, and 111 false posi-
tives (Fp) and 112 false negatives (Fn) to approach
2. Apart from the comments explained in the pre-
vious section about the small number of instances
on the MedLine subset, we think the main problem
is related with the management of long sentences
with complex syntax. These sentences are more dif-
ficult for our approaches because the complexity of
the sentence generates more errors in the tokenizing
and parsing processes affecting the representation of
the instances both in training and test phases. We
show below some false positives and false negatives
examples.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have shown our approaches for
the Semeval 2013 DDI Extraction challenge. We
have explored different combinations of tree and se-
quence features using the Sequential Minimal Opti-
mization algorithm.
The first approach uses a SVM with 5 categories,
and the second one extracts the final results in two
steps: detection with all the categories, and classifi-
cation on the positive instances. The results are bet-
ter for approach 2 mainly due to the improvement on
the detection subtask because the information from
all the categories is used.
We think some of our errors come from using a
general tool (Stanford parser) to obtain the parse tree
of the sentences. In the future we are going to ex-
plore other biomedical parsers and tokenizers.
With respect to the data used, we think the Med-
Line dataset needs to be greater in order to ob-
tain more significant analysis and results. Our ap-
proaches are especially affected by this issue be-
cause the small number of positive instances on ad-
vice and int categories implies that the algorithm can
not learn to classify new instances accurately. On
the other hand, although n-fold cross validation is
considered as the best model validation technique,
it was time consuming for DDI and need powerful
processors.
Another interesting future work is related with
the application of simplification techniques in order
to solve the problems in the processing of complex
long sentences (Buyko et al, 2011).
