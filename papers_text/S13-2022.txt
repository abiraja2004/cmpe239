Abstract
This paper describes the evaluation of differ-
ent kinds of textual features for the Cross-
Lingual Textual Entailment Task of SemEval
2013. We have counted the number of N -
grams for three types of textual entities (char-
acter, word and PoS tags) that exist in the
pair of sentences from which we are inter-
ested in determining the judgment of textual
entailment. Difference, intersection and dis-
tance (Euclidian, Manhattan and Jaccard) of
N -grams were considered for constructing a
feature vector which is further introduced in
a support vector machine classifier which al-
lows to construct a classification model. Five
different runs were submitted, one of them
considering voting system of the previous four
approaches. The results obtained show a per-
formance below the median of six teams that
have participated in the competition.
1 Introduction
The cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE), re-
cently proposed by (Mehdad et al, 2012) and
(Mehdad et al, 2011), is an extension of the tex-
tual entailment task (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).
Formally speaking, given a pair of topically related
text fragments (T1 and T2 which are assumed to
be TRUE statements) written in different languages,
the CLTE task consists of automatically annotating
it with one of the following entailment judgments:
? bidirectional (T1 ? T2 & T1 ? T2): the two
fragments entail each other (semantic equiva-
lence);
? forward (T1 ? T2 & T1 8 T2): unidirec-
tional entailment from T1 to T2;
? backward (T1 9 T2 & T1 ? T2): unidirec-
tional entailment from T2 to T1;
? no entailment (T1 9 T2 & T1 8 T2): there
is no entailment between T1 and T2 in both
directions;
The Cross-lingual datasets evaluated were avail-
able for the following language combinations (T1-
T2):
? Spanish-English (SPA-ENG)
? German-English (DEU-ENG)
? Italian-English (ITA-ENG)
? French-English (FRA-ENG)
In this paper we describe the evaluation of differ-
ent features extracted from each pair of topically re-
lated sentences. N -grams of characters, words and
PoS tags were counted with the aim of constructing
a representative vector for each judgment entailment
(FORWARD, BACKWARD, BI-DIRECTIONAL or
NO-ENTAILMENT). The resulting vectors were
fed into a supervised classifier based on Support
Vector Machines (SVM)1 which attempted to con-
struct a classification model. The description of the
features and the vectorial representation is given in
Section 2. The obtained results are shown and di-
cussed in Section 3. Finally, the findings of this
work are given in Section 4.

(Hall et al, 2009).

2 Experimental Setup
We have considered the task as a classification prob-
lem using the pivot approach. Thus, we have trans-
lated2 each pair to their corresponding language in
order to have two pairs of sentences written in the
same language. Let Pair(T1, T2) be the origi-
nal pair of topically related sentences. Then, we
have obtained the English translation of T1, de-
noted by T3, which will be aligned with T2. On
the other hand, we have translated T2 to the other
language (Spanish, German, Italian or French), de-
noted by T4, which will be aligned with T1. The
two pairs of sentences, Pair(T2, T3) (English) and
Pair(T1, T4) (other language), are now written in
the same language, and we can proceed to calculate
the textual features we are interested in.
The features used to represent both sentences are
described below:
? N -grams of characters, with N = 2, ? ? ? , 5.
? N -grams of words, with N = 2, ? ? ? , 4.
? N -grams of PoS tags, with N = 2, ? ? ? , 4.
? Euclidean measure between each pair of sen-
tences (Pair(T1, T4) and Pair(T2, T3)).
? Manhattan measure between each pair of sen-
tences (Pair(T1, T4) and Pair(T2, T3)).
? Jaccard coefficient, expanding English terms in
both sentences, T2 and T3, with their corre-
sponding synonyms (none disambiguation pro-
cess was considered).
The manner we have used the above mentioned
features is described in detail in the following sub-
sections.
2.1 Approach 1: Difference operator
For each pair of sentences written in the same lan-
guage, this approach counts the number of N -grams
that occur in the first sentence (for instance T1), and
do not occur in the second sentence (for instance
T4) and viceversa. Formally speaking, the values
obtained are ????Pair(T1, T2) = {D1, D2, ? ? ? , Dk},
with D1 = |T1 ? T4|, D2 = |T4 ? T1|, D3 =

|T2 ? T3|, D4 = |T3 ? T2|, ? ? ?. This vector is
calculated for all the possible values of N for each
type of N -gram, i.e., character, word and PoS tag.
The cardinality of ????Pair(T1, T2) will be 34, that is,
16 values when the N -grams of characters are con-
sidered, 12 values with word N -grams, and 6 values
when the PoS tag N -grams are used.
The vectors obtained are labeled with the corre-
sponding tag in order to construct a training dataset
which will be further used to feed a multiclass clas-
sifier which constructs the final classification model.
In this case, the system will directly return one of the
four valid entailment judgments (i.e. forward, back-
ward, bidirectional, no entailment).
2.2 Approach 2: Difference and Intersection
operators
This approach enriches the previous one, by adding
the intersection between the two sentences of each
pair. In a sense, we have considered all the features
appearing in the pair of sentences. In this case, the
total number of features extracted, i.e., the cardinal-
ity of the ????Pair(T1, T2) vector is 51.
2.3 Approach 3: Metaclassifier
In this approach, we have constructed a system
which is a composition of different binary classifica-
tion models. The binary judgments were constructed
considering the classes shown in Table 1.
The approach 2 was also considered in this com-
position generating a total of 11 models. 10 of them
are based on the features used by Approach 1, and
the last one is based on the features used by Ap-
proach 2. The result obtained is a vector which tells
whether or not a pair is judged to have some kind of
textual entailment or not (the OTHER class). This
125
vector is then labeled with the correct class obtained
from the gold standard (training corpus) for auto-
matically obtaining a decision tree which allows us
to determine the correct class. Thus, the different
outputs of multiple classifiers are then introduced to
another supervised classifier which constructs the fi-
nal classification model.
2.4 Approach 4: Distances measures
This approach is constructed by adding five distance
values to the Approach 2. These values are calcu-
lated as follows :
? The Euclidean distance between T2 and T3,
and between T1 and T4. We have used the fre-
quency of each word for constructing a repre-
sentative vector of each sentence.
? The Manhattan distance between T2 and T3,
and between T1 and T4. We have used the fre-
quency of each word for constructing a repre-
sentative vector of each sentence.
? A variant of the Jaccard?s Coefficient that con-
sider synonyms (Carrillo et al, 2012). Since we
have only obtained synonyms for the English
language, this measure was only calculated be-
tween T2 and T3.
Therefore, the total number of features of the????
Pair(T1, T2) vector is 56.
2.5 Approach 5: Voting system
With the results of the previous four models, we pre-
pared a voting system which uses the majority crite-
rion (3 of 4).
3 Experimental results
The results obtained in the competition are presented
and discussed in this section. First, we describe the
training and test corpus, and thereafter, the results
obtained with the different approaches submitted.
3.1 Dataset
In order to train the different approaches already dis-
cussed, we have constructed a training corpus made
up of two datasets: the training data provided by the
task organizers the task 8 of SemEval 2013 (Negri
et al, 2013), and the test dataset together with the
gold standard of CLTE task of SemEval 2012 (Ne-
gri et al, 2011). Thus, the training corpus contains
4000 sentence pairs. The test set provided in the
competition contains 2000 sentence pairs. The cor-
pus is balanced, with 1000 pairs for each language
in the training dataset, whereas, 500 pairs are given
in the test set for each language (see Table 2).

SPA-ENG 1000 500
DEU-ENG 1000 500
ITA-ENG 1000 500
FRA-ENG 1000 500
Total 4000 2000
3.2 Results
In Table 3 we can see the results obtained by each
one of the five approaches we submitted to the com-
petition. Each approach has been labeled with the
prefix ?BUAP-R? for indicating the approach used
by each submitted run. For instance, the BUAP-R1
run corresponds to the approach 1 described in the
previous section. As can be seen, the behavior of the
five approaches is quite similar, which we consider
it is expected because the underlying methodology
employed is almost the same for all the approaches.
With exception of the pair of sentences written in
SPA-ENG in which the best approach was obtained
by the BUAP-R5 run, the approach 4 outperformed
the other appproaches. We believe that this has been
a result of introducing measures of similarity be-
tween the two sentences and their translations. In
this table it is also reported the Highest, Average,
Median and Lowest values of the competition. The
results we obtained are under the Median but outper-
formed the results of two teams in the competition.
With the purpose of analyzing the behavior of the
approach 4 in each one of the entailment judgments,
we have provided the results obtained in Table 4.
There we can see that the BACKWARD class is the
easiest one for being predicted, independently of the
language. The second easiest class is FORWARD,
followed by NO-ENTAILMENT. Also we can see
that the BI-DIRECTIONAL class is the one that pro-
duce more confusion, thus leading to obtain a lower
performance than the other ones.

4 Conclusions
Five different approaches for the Cross-lingual Tex-
tual Entailment for the Content Synchronization task
of Semeval 2013 are reported in this paper. We used
several features for determining the textual entail-
ment judgment between two texts T1 and T2 (writ-
ten in two different languages). The approach 4
proposed, which employed lexical similarity and se-
mantic similarity in English language only was the
one that performed better. As future work, we would
like to include more distance metrics which allow to
extract additional features of the pair of sentences
topically related.
