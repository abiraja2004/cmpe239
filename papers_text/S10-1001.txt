Abstract
This paper presents the SemEval-2010
task on Coreference Resolution in Multi-
ple Languages. The goal was to evaluate
and compare automatic coreference reso-
lution systems for six different languages
(Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian,
and Spanish) in four evaluation settings
and using four different metrics. Such a
rich scenario had the potential to provide
insight into key issues concerning corefer-
ence resolution: (i) the portability of sys-
tems across languages, (ii) the relevance of
different levels of linguistic information,
and (iii) the behavior of scoring metrics.
1 Introduction
The task of coreference resolution, defined as the
identification of the expressions in a text that re-
fer to the same discourse entity (1), has attracted
considerable attention within the NLP community.
(1) Major League Baseball sent its head of se-
curity to Chicago to review the second in-
cident of an on-field fan attack in the last
seven months. The league is reviewing se-
curity at all ballparks to crack down on
spectator violence.
Using coreference information has been shown to
be beneficial in a number of NLP applications
including Information Extraction (McCarthy and
Lehnert, 1995), Text Summarization (Steinberger
et al, 2007), Question Answering (Morton, 1999),
and Machine Translation. There have been a few
evaluation campaigns on coreference resolution in
the past, namely MUC (Hirschman and Chinchor,
1997), ACE (Doddington et al, 2004), and ARE
(Orasan et al, 2008), yet many questions remain
open:
? To what extent is it possible to imple-
ment a general coreference resolution system
portable to different languages? How much
language-specific tuning is necessary?
? How helpful are morphology, syntax and se-
mantics for solving coreference relations?
How much preprocessing is needed? Does its
quality (perfect linguistic input versus noisy
automatic input) really matter?
? How (dis)similar are different coreference
evaluation metrics?MUC, B-CUBED,
CEAF and BLANC? Do they all provide the
same ranking? Are they correlated?
Our goal was to address these questions in a
shared task. Given six datasets in Catalan, Dutch,
English, German, Italian, and Spanish, the task
we present involved automatically detecting full
coreference chains?composed of named entities
(NEs), pronouns, and full noun phrases?in four
different scenarios. For more information, the
reader is referred to the task website.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the corpora from which the task
datasets were extracted, and the automatic tools
used to preprocess them. In Section 3, we describe
the task by providing information about the data
format, evaluation settings, and evaluation met-
rics. Participating systems are described in Sec-
tion 4, and their results are analyzed and compared
in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.
2 Linguistic Resources
In this section, we first present the sources of the
data used in the task. We then describe the auto-
matic tools that predicted input annotations for the
coreference resolution systems.

Table 1: Size of the task datasets.
2.1 Source Corpora
Catalan and Spanish The AnCora corpora (Re-
casens and Mart??, 2009) consist of a Catalan and
a Spanish treebank of 500k words each, mainly
from newspapers and news agencies (El Peri?odico,
EFE, ACN). Manual annotation exists for ar-
guments and thematic roles, predicate semantic
classes, NEs, WordNet nominal senses, and coref-
erence relations. AnCora are freely available for
research purposes.
Dutch The KNACK-2002 corpus (Hoste and De
Pauw, 2006) contains 267 documents from the
Flemish weekly magazine Knack. They were
manually annotated with coreference information
on top of semi-automatically annotated PoS tags,
phrase chunks, and NEs.
English The OntoNotes Release 2.0 corpus
(Pradhan et al, 2007) covers newswire and broad-
cast news data: 300k words from The Wall Street
Journal, and 200k words from the TDT-4 col-
lection, respectively. OntoNotes builds on the
Penn Treebank for syntactic annotation and on the
Penn PropBank for predicate argument structures.
Semantic annotations include NEs, words senses
(linked to an ontology), and coreference informa-
tion. The OntoNotes corpus is distributed by the
Linguistic Data Consortium.
2
German The T?uBa-D/Z corpus (Hinrichs et al,
2005) is a newspaper treebank based on data taken
from the daily issues of ?die tageszeitung? (taz). It
currently comprises 794k words manually anno-
tated with semantic and coreference information.
Due to licensing restrictions of the original texts, a
taz-DVD must be purchased to obtain a license.
2
Italian The LiveMemories corpus (Rodr??guez
et al, 2010) will include texts from the Italian
Wikipedia, blogs, news articles, and dialogues

Free user license agreements for the English and German
task datasets were issued to the task participants.
(MapTask). They are being annotated according
to the ARRAU annotation scheme with coref-
erence, agreement, and NE information on top
of automatically parsed data. The task dataset
included Wikipedia texts already annotated.
The datasets that were used in the task were ex-
tracted from the above-mentioned corpora. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the number of documents
(docs), sentences (sents), and tokens in the train-
ing, development and test sets.

2.2 Preprocessing Systems
Catalan, Spanish, English Predicted lemmas
and PoS were generated using FreeLing
4
for
Catalan/Spanish and SVMTagger
5
for English.
Dependency information and predicate semantic
roles were generated with JointParser, a syntactic-
semantic parser.
6
Dutch Lemmas, PoS and NEs were automat-
ically provided by the memory-based shallow
parser for Dutch (Daelemans et al, 1999), and de-
pendency information by the Alpino parser (van
Noord et al, 2006).
German Lemmas were predicted by TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1995), PoS and morphology by RFTag-
ger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), and dependency in-
formation by MaltParser (Hall and Nivre, 2008).
Italian Lemmas and PoS were provided by
TextPro,
7
and dependency information by Malt-
Parser.

The German and Dutch training datasets were not com-
pletely stable during the competition period due to a few er-
rors. Revised versions were released on March 2 and 20, re-
spectively. As to the test datasets, the Dutch and Italian doc-
uments with formatting errors were corrected after the eval-
uation period, with no variations in the ranking order of sys-
tems.

3 Task Description
Participants were asked to develop an automatic
system capable of assigning a discourse entity to
every mention,
9
thus identifying all the NP men-
tions of every discourse entity. As there is no
standard annotation scheme for coreference and
the source corpora differed in certain aspects, the
coreference information of the task datasets was
produced according to three criteria:
? Only NP constituents and possessive deter-
miners can be mentions.
? Mentions must be referential expressions,
thus ruling out nominal predicates, appos-
itives, expletive NPs, attributive NPs, NPs
within idioms, etc.
? Singletons are also considered as entities
(i.e., entities with a single mention).
To help participants build their systems, the
task datasets also contained both gold-standard
and automatically predicted linguistic annotations
at the morphological, syntactic and semantic lev-
els. Considerable effort was devoted to provide
participants with a common and relatively simple
data representation for the six languages.
3.1 Data Format
The task datasets as well as the participants?
answers were displayed in a uniform column-
based format, similar to the style used in previous
CoNLL shared tasks on syntactic and semantic de-
pendencies (2008/2009).
10
Each dataset was pro-
vided as a single file per language. Since corefer-
ence is a linguistic relation at the discourse level,
documents constitute the basic unit, and are de-
limited by ?#begin document ID? and ?#end doc-
ument ID? comment lines. Within a document, the
information of each sentence is organized verti-
cally with one token per line, and a blank line after
the last token of each sentence. The information
associated with each token is described in several
columns (separated by ?\t? characters) represent-
ing the following layers of linguistic annotation.
ID (column 1). Token identifiers in the sentence.
Token (column 2). Word forms.
9
Following the terminology of the ACE program, a men-
tion is defined as an instance of reference to an object, and
an entity is the collection of mentions referring to the same
object in a document.

the token is the tree root).
DepRel (column 11). Dependency relations cor-
responding to the dependencies described in
the Head column (?sentence? if the token is
the tree root).
NE (column 13). NE types in open-close notation.
Pred (column 15). Predicate semantic class.
APreds (column 17 and subsequent ones). For
each predicate in the Pred column, its seman-
tic roles/dependencies.
Coref (last column). Coreference relations in
open-close notation.
The above-mentioned columns are ?gold-
standard columns,? whereas columns 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16 and the penultimate contain the same
information as the respective previous column but
automatically predicted?using the preprocessing
systems listed in Section 2.2. Neither all layers
of linguistic annotation nor all gold-standard and
predicted columns were available for all six lan-
guages (underscore characters indicate missing in-
formation).
The coreference column follows an open-close
notation with an entity number in parentheses (see
Table 2). Every entity has an ID number, and ev-
ery mention is marked with the ID of the entity
it refers to: an opening parenthesis shows the be-
ginning of the mention (first token), while a clos-
ing parenthesis shows the end of the mention (last
3
token). For tokens belonging to more than one
mention, a pipe character is used to separate mul-
tiple entity IDs. The resulting annotation is a well-
formed nested structure (CF language).
3.2 Evaluation Settings
In order to address our goal of studying the effect
of different levels of linguistic information (pre-
processing) on solving coreference relations, the
test was divided into four evaluation settings that
differed along two dimensions.
Gold-standard versus Regular setting. Only
in the gold-standard setting were participants al-
lowed to use the gold-standard columns, includ-
ing the last one (of the test dataset) with true
mention boundaries. In the regular setting, they
were allowed to use only the automatically pre-
dicted columns. Obtaining better results in the
gold setting would provide evidence for the rel-
evance of using high-quality preprocessing infor-
mation. Since not all columns were available for
all six languages, the gold setting was only possi-
ble for Catalan, English, German, and Spanish.
Closed versus Open setting. In the closed set-
ting, systems had to be built strictly with the in-
formation provided in the task datasets. In con-
trast, there was no restriction on the resources that
participants could utilize in the open setting: sys-
tems could be developed using any external tools
and resources to predict the preprocessing infor-
mation, e.g., WordNet, Wikipedia, etc. The only
requirement was to use tools that had not been de-
veloped with the annotations of the test set. This
setting provided an open door into tools or re-
sources that improve performance.
3.3 Evaluation Metrics
Since there is no agreement at present on a stan-
dard measure for coreference resolution evalua-
tion, one of our goals was to compare the rank-
ings produced by four different measures. The
task scorer provides results in the two mention-
based metrics B
3
(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and
CEAF-?
3
(Luo, 2005), and the two link-based
metrics MUC (Vilain et al, 1995) and BLANC
(Recasens and Hovy, in prep). The first three mea-
sures have been widely used, while BLANC is a
proposal of a new measure interesting to test.
The mention detection subtask is measured with
recall, precision, and F
1
. Mentions are rewarded
with 1 point if their boundaries coincide with those
of the gold NP, with 0.5 points if their boundaries
are within the gold NP including its head, and
with 0 otherwise.
4 Participating Systems
A total of twenty-two participants registered for
the task and downloaded the training materials.
From these, sixteen downloaded the test set but
only six (out of which two task organizers) sub-
mitted valid results (corresponding to nine system
runs or variants). These numbers show that the
task raised considerable interest but that the final
participation rate was comparatively low (slightly
below 30%).
The participating systems differed in terms of
architecture, machine learning method, etc. Ta-
ble 3 summarizes their main properties. Systems
like BART and Corry support several machine
learners, but Table 3 indicates the one used for the
SemEval run. The last column indicates the exter-
nal resources that were employed in the open set-
ting, thus it is empty for systems that participated
only in the closed setting. For more specific details
we address the reader to the system description pa-
pers in Erk and Strapparava (2010).
5 Results and Evaluation
Table 4 shows the results obtained by two naive
baseline systems: (i) SINGLETONS considers each
mention as a separate entity, and (ii) ALL-IN-ONE
groups all the mentions in a document into a sin-
gle entity. These simple baselines reveal limita-
tions of the evaluation metrics, like the high scores
of CEAF and B
3
for SINGLETONS. Interestingly
enough, the naive baseline scores turn out to be
hard to beat by the participating systems, as Ta-
ble 5 shows. Similarly, ALL-IN-ONE obtains high
scores in terms of MUC. Table 4 also reveals dif-
ferences between the distribution of entities in the
datasets. Dutch is clearly the most divergent cor-
pus mainly due to the fact that it only contains sin-
gletons for NEs.
Table 5 displays the results of all systems for all
languages and settings in the four evaluation met-
rics (the best scores in each setting are highlighted
in bold). Results are presented sequentially by lan-
guage and setting, and participating systems are
ordered alphabetically. The participation of sys-
tems across languages and settings is rather irreg-
ular,
11
thus making it difficult to draw firm conclu-

sions about the aims initially pursued by the task.
In the following, we summarize the most relevant
outcomes of the evaluation.
Regarding languages, English concentrates the
most participants (fifteen entries), followed by
German (eight), Catalan and Spanish (seven each),
Italian (five), and Dutch (three). The number of
languages addressed by each system ranges from
one (Corry) to six (UBIU and SUCRE); BART and
RelaxCor addressed three languages, and TANL-1
five. The best overall results are obtained for En-
glish followed by German, then Catalan, Spanish
and Italian, and finally Dutch. Apart from differ-
ences between corpora, there are other factors that
might explain this ranking: (i) the fact that most of
the systems were originally developed for English,
and (ii) differences in corpus size (German having
the largest corpus, and Dutch the smallest).
Regarding systems, there are no clear ?win-
ners.? Note that no language-setting was ad-
dressed by all six systems. The BART system,
for instance, is either on its own or competing
against a single system. It emerges from par-
tial comparisons that SUCRE performs the best in
closed?regular for English, German, and Italian,
although it never outperforms the CEAF or B
3
sin-
gleton baseline. While SUCRE always obtains the
best scores according to MUC and BLANC, Re-
laxCor and TANL-1 usually win based on CEAF
and B
3
. The Corry system presents three variants
optimized for CEAF (Corry-C), MUC (Corry-M),
and BLANC (Corry-B). Their results are consis-
tent with the bias introduced in the optimization
(see English:open?gold).
Depending on the evaluation metric then, the
rankings of systems vary with considerable score
differences. There is a significant positive corre-
lation between CEAF and B
3
(Pearson?s r = 0.91,
p< 0.01), and a significant lack of correlation be-
tween CEAF and MUC in terms of recall (Pear-
son?s r = 0.44, p< 0.01). This fact stresses the
importance of defining appropriate metrics (or a
combination of them) for coreference evaluation.
Finally, regarding evaluation settings, the re-
sults in the gold setting are significantly better than
those in the regular. However, this might be a di-
rect effect of the mention recognition task. Men-
tion recognition in the regular setting falls more
than 20 F
1
points with respect to the gold setting
(where correct mention boundaries were given).
As for the open versus closed setting, there is only
one system, RelaxCor for English, that addressed
the two. As expected, results show a slight im-
provement from closed?gold to open?gold.

The goal of the task was to evaluate and compare
automatic coreference resolution systems for six
different languages in four evaluation settings and
using four different metrics. This complex sce-
nario aimed at providing insight into several as-
pects of coreference resolution, including portabil-
ity across languages, relevance of linguistic infor-
mation at different levels, and behavior of alterna-
tive scoring metrics.
The task attracted considerable attention from a
number of researchers, but only six teams submit-
ted their final results. Participating systems did not
run their systems for all the languages and evalu-
ation settings, thus making direct comparisons be-
tween them very difficult. Nonetheless, we were
able to observe some interesting aspects from the
empirical evaluation.
An important conclusion was the confirmation
that different evaluation metrics provide different
system rankings and the scores are not commen-
surate. Attention thus needs to be paid to corefer-
ence evaluation. The behavior and applicability of
the scoring metrics requires further investigation
in order to guarantee a fair evaluation when com-
paring systems in the future. We hope to have the
opportunity to thoroughly discuss this and the rest
of interesting questions raised by the task during
the SemEval workshop at ACL 2010.
An additional valuable benefit is the set of re-
sources developed throughout the task. As task
organizers, we intend to facilitate the sharing of
datasets, scorers, and documentation by keeping
them available for future research use. We believe
that these resources will help to set future bench-
marks for the research community and will con-
tribute positively to the progress of the state of the
art in coreference resolution. We will maintain and
update the task website with post-SemEval contri-
butions.
