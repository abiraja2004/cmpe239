Abstract
This paper attempts to analyze and bound the utility
of various structured and unstructured resources in
Question Answering, independent of a specific sys-
tem or component. We quantify the degree to which
gazetteers, web resources, encyclopedia, web doc-
uments and web-based query expansion can help
Question Answering in general and specific ques-
tion types in particular. Depending on which re-
sources are used, the QA task may shift from com-
plex answer-finding mechanisms to simpler data ex-
traction methods followed by answer re-mapping in
local documents.
1 Introduction
During recent years the Question Answering (QA)
field has undergone considerable changes: question
types have diversified, question complexity has in-
creased, and evaluations have become more stan-
dardized - as reflected by the TREC QA track
(Voorhees, 2003). Some recent approaches have
tapped into external data sources such as the Web,
encyclopedias, databases in order to find answer
candidates, which may then be located in the spe-
cific corpus being searched (Dumais et al, 2002; Xu
et al, 2003). As systems improve, the availability
of rich resources will be increasingly critical to QA
performance. While on-line resources such as the
Web, WordNet, gazetteers, and encyclopedias are
becoming more prevalent, no system-independent
study has quantified their impact on the QA task.
This paper focuses on several resources and their
inherent potential to provide answers, without con-
centrating on a particular QA system or component.
The goal is to quantify and bound the potential im-
pact of these resources on the QA process.
2 Related Work
More and more QA systems are using the Web as
a resource. Since the Web is orders of magni-
tude larger than local corpora, redundancy of an-
swers and supporting passages allows systems to
produce more correct, confident answers (Clarke et
al., 2001; Dumais et al, 2002). (Lin, 2002) presents
two different approaches to using the Web: access-
ing the structured data and mining the unstructured
data. Due to their complementary nature of these
approaches, hybrid systems are likely to perform
better (Lin and Katz, 2003).
Definitional questions (?What is X??, ?Who
is X??) are especially compatible with structured
resources such as gazetteers and encyclopedias.
The top performing definitional systems (Xu et
al., 2003) at TREC extract kernel facts similar to
a question profile built using structured and semi-
structured resources: WordNet (Miller et al, 1990),
Merriam-Webster dictionary www.m-w.com), the
Columbia Encyclopedia (www.bartleby.com),
Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com), a biog-
raphy dictionary (www.s9.com) and Google
(www.google.com).
3 Approach
For the purpose of this paper, resources consist of
structured and semi-structured knowledge, such as
the Web, web search engines, gazetteers, and ency-
clopedias. Although many QA systems incorporate
or access such resources, few systems quantify in-
dividual resource impact on their performance and
little work has been done to estimate bounds on re-
source impact to Question Answering. Independent
of a specific QA system, we quantify the degree to
which these resources are able to directly provide
answers to questions.
Experiments are performed on the 2,393 ques-
tions and the corresponding answer keys provided
through NIST (Voorhees, 2003) as part of the TREC
8 through TREC 12 evaluations.
4 Gazetteers
Although the Web consists of mostly unstructured
and loosely structured information, the available
structured data is a valuable resource for question
answering. Gazetteers in particular cover several
frequently-asked factoid question types, such as
?What is the population of X?? or ?What is the cap-
ital of Y??. The CIA World Factbook is a database
containing geographical, political, and economi-
cal profiles of all the countries in the world. We
also analyzed two additional data sources contain-
ing astronomy information (www.astronomy.com)
and detailed information about the fifty US states
(www.50states.com).
Since gazetteers provide up-to-date information,
some answers will differ from answers in local
corpora or the Web. Moreover, questions requir-
ing interval-type answers (e.g. ?How close is the
sun??) may not match answers from different
sources which are also correct. Gazetteers offer
high precision answers, but have limited recall since
they only cover a limited number of questions (See
Table 1).

5 WordNet
Wordnets and ontologies are very common re-
sources and are employed in a wide variety of di-
rect and indirect QA tasks, such as reasoning based
on axioms extracted from WordNet (Moldovan et
al., 2003), probabilistic inference using lexical rela-
tions for passage scoring (Paranjpe et al, 2003), and
answer filtering via WordNet constraints (Leidner et
al., 2003).

Table 2 shows an upper bound on how many
TREC questions could be answered directly using
WordNet as an answer source. Question terms and
phrases were extracted and looked up in WordNet
glosses, synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. If
the answer key matched the relevant WordNet data,
then an answer was considered to be found. Since
some answers might occur coincidentally, we these
results to represent upper bounds on possible utility.
6 Structured Data Sources
Encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other web
databases are structured data sources that are often
employed in answering definitional questions (e.g.,
?What is X??, ?Who is X??). The top-performing
definitional systems at TREC (Xu et al, 2003)
extract kernel facts similar question profiles built
using structured and semi-structured resources:
WordNet (Miller et al, 1990), the Merriam-
Webster dictionary www.m-w.com), the Columbia
Encyclopedia (www.bartleby.com), Wikipedia
(www.wikipedia.com), a biography dictionary
(www.s9.com) and Google (www.google.com).
Table 3 shows a number of data sources and
their impact on answering TREC questions. N-
grams were extracted from each question and run
through Wikipedia and Google?s define operator
(which searches specialized dictionaries, definition
lists, glossaries, abbreviation lists etc). Table 3
show that TREC 10 and 11 questions benefit the
most from the use of an encyclopedia, since they
include many definitional questions. On the other
hand, since TREC 12 has fewer definitional ques-
tions and more procedural questions, it does not
benefit as much from Wikipedia or Google?s define
operator.

7 Answer Type Coverage
To test coverage of different answer types, we em-
ployed the top level of the answer type hierarchy
used by the JAVELIN system (Nyberg et al, 2003).
The most frequent types are: definition (e.g. ?What
is viscosity??), person-bio (e.g. ?Who was La-
can??), object(e.g. ?Name the highest mountain.?),
process (e.g. ?How did Cleopatra die??), lexicon
(?What does CBS stand for??)temporal(e.g. ?When
is the first day of summer??), numeric (e.g. ?How
tall is Mount Everest??), location (e.g. ?Where is
Tokyo??), and proper-name (e.g. ?Who owns the
Raiders??).

Table 4: Coverage of TREC questions divided by
most common answer types.
Table 4 shows TREC question coverage broken
down by answer type. Due to temporal consistency,
numeric questions are not covered very well. Al-
though the process and object types are broad an-
swer types, the coverage is still reasonably good.
As expected, the definition and person-bio answer
types are covered well by these resources.
8 The Web as a Resource
An increasing number of QA systems are using the
web as a resource. Since the Web is orders of mag-
nitude larger than local corpora, answers occur fre-
quently in simple contexts, which is more conducive
to retrieval and extraction of correct, confident an-
swers (Clarke et al, 2001; Dumais et al, 2002;
Lin and Katz, 2003). The web has been employed
for pattern acquisition (Ravichandran et al, 2003),
document retrieval (Dumais et al, 2002), query ex-
pansion (Yang et al, 2003), structured information
extraction, and answer validation (Magnini et al,
2002) . Some of these approaches enhance exist-
ing QA systems, while others simplify the question
answering task, allowing a less complex approach
to find correct answers.
8.1 Web Documents
Instead of searching a local corpus, some QA sys-
tems retrieve relevant documents from the web (Xu
et al, 2003). Since the density of relevant web doc-
uments can be higher than the density of relevant
local documents, answer extraction may be more
successful from the web. For a TREC evaluation,
answers found on the web must also be mapped to
relevant documents in the local corpus.

Figure 1: Web retrieval: relevant document density
and rank of first relevant document.
In order to evaluate the impact of web docu-
ments on TREC questions, we performed an ex-
periment where simple queries were submitted to
a web search engine. The questions were to-
kenized and filtered using a standard stop word
list. The resulting keyword queries were used to
retrieve 100 documents through the Google API
(www.google.com/api). Documents containing the
full question, question number, references to TREC,
NIST, AQUAINT, Question Answering and similar
content were filtered out.
Figure 1 shows the density of documents contain-
ing a correct answer, as well as the rank of the first
document containing a correct answer. The sim-
ple word query retrieves a relevant document for
almost half of the questions. Note that for most
systems, the retrieval performance should be supe-
rior since queries are usually more refined and addi-
tional query expansion is performed. However, this
experiment provides an intuition and a very good
lower bound on the precision and density of current
web documents for the TREC QA task.
8.2 Web-Based Query Expansion
Several QA systems participating at TREC have
used search engines for query expansion (Yang et
al., 2003). The basic query expansion method
utilizes pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) (Xu and
Croft, 1996). Content words are selected from ques-
tions and submitted as queries to a search engine.
The top n retrieved documents are selected, and k
terms or phrases are extracted according to an op-
timization criterion (e.g. term frequency, n-gram
frequency, average mutual information using cor-
pus statistics, etc). These k items are used in the
expanded query.
We experimented by using the top 5, 10, 15, 20,

50, and 100 documents retrieved via the Google API
for each question, and extracted the most frequent
fifty n-grams (up to trigrams). The goal was to de-
termine the quality of query expansion as measured
by the density of correct answers already present
in the expansion terms. Even without filtering n-
grams matching the expected answer type, simple
PRF produces the correct answer in the top n-grams
for more than half the questions. The best correct
answer density is achieved using PRF with only 20
web documents.
8.3 Conclusions
This paper quantifies the utility of well-known and
widely-used resources such as WordNet, encyclope-
dias, gazetteers and the Web on question answering.
The experiments presented in this paper represent
loose bounds on the direct use of these resources in
answering TREC questions. We reported the perfor-
mance of these resources on different TREC collec-
tions and on different question types. We also quan-
tified web retrieval performance, and confirmed that
the web contains a consistently high density of rel-
evant documents containing correct answers even
when simple queries are used. The paper also
shows that pseudo-relevance feedback alone using
web documents for query expansions can produce
a correct answer for fifty percent of the questions
examined.
