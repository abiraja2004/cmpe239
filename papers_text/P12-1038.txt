Abstract
We present a holistic data-driven approach
to image description generation, exploit-
ing the vast amount of (noisy) parallel im-
age data and associated natural language
descriptions available on the web. More
specifically, given a query image, we re-
trieve existing human-composed phrases
used to describe visually similar images,
then selectively combine those phrases
to generate a novel description for the
query image. We cast the generation pro-
cess as constraint optimization problems,
collectively incorporating multiple inter-
connected aspects of language composition
for content planning, surface realization
and discourse structure. Evaluation by hu-
man annotators indicates that our final
system generates more semantically cor-
rect and linguistically appealing descrip-
tions than two nontrivial baselines.
1 Introduction
Automatically describing images in natural lan-
guage is an intriguing, but complex AI task, re-
quiring accurate computational visual recogni-
tion, comprehensive world knowledge, and natu-
ral language generation. Some past research has
simplified the general image description goal by
assuming that relevant text for an image is pro-
vided (e.g., Aker and Gaizauskas (2010), Feng
and Lapata (2010)). This allows descriptions to
be generated using effective summarization tech-
niques with relatively surface level image under-
standing. However, such text (e.g., news articles
or encyclopedic text) is often only loosely related
to an image?s specific content and many natu-
ral images do not come with associated text for
summarization.
In contrast, other recent work has focused
more on the visual recognition aspect by de-
tecting content elements (e.g., scenes, objects,
attributes, actions, etc) and then composing de-
scriptions from scratch (e.g., Yao et al (2010),
Kulkarni et al (2011), Yang et al (2011), Li
et al (2011)), or by retrieving existing whole
descriptions from visually similar images (e.g.,
Farhadi et al (2010), Ordonez et al (2011)). For
the latter approaches, it is unrealistic to expect
that there will always exist a single complete de-
scription for retrieval that is pertinent to a given
query image. For the former approaches, visual
recognition first generates an intermediate rep-
resentation of image content using a set of En-
glish words, then language generation constructs
a full description by adding function words and
optionally applying simple re-ordering. Because
the generation process sticks relatively closely
to the recognized content, the resulting descrip-
tions often lack the kind of coverage, creativ-
ity, and complexity typically found in human-
written text.
In this paper, we propose a holistic data-
driven approach that combines and extends the
best aspects of these previous approaches ? a)
using visual recognition to directly predict indi-
vidual image content elements, and b) using re-
trieval from existing human-composed descrip-
tions to generate natural, creative, and inter-
359
esting captions. We also lift the restriction of
retrieving existing whole descriptions by gather-
ing visually relevant phrases which we combine
to produce novel and query-image specific de-
scriptions. By judiciously exploiting the corre-
spondence between image content elements and
phrases, it is possible to generate natural lan-
guage descriptions that are substantially richer
in content and more linguistically interesting
than previous work.
At a high level, our approach can be moti-
vated by linguistic theories about the connection
between reading activities and writing skills,
i.e., substantial reading enriches writing skills,
(e.g., Hafiz and Tudor (1989), Tsang (1996)).
Analogously, our generation algorithm attains a
higher level of linguistic sophistication by read-
ing large amounts of descriptive text available
online. Our approach is also motivated by lan-
guage grounding by visual worlds (e.g., Roy
(2002), Dindo and Zambuto (2010), Monner and
Reggia (2011)), as in our approach the mean-
ing of a phrase in a description is implicitly
grounded by the relevant content of the image.
Another important thrust of this work is col-
lective image-level content-planning, integrating
saliency, content relations, and discourse struc-
ture based on statistics drawn from a large
image-text parallel corpus. This contrasts with
previous approaches that generate multiple sen-
tences without considering discourse flow or re-
dundancy (e.g., Li et al (2011)). For example,
for an image showing a flock of birds, generating
a large number of sentences stating the relative
position of each bird is probably not useful.
Content planning and phrase synthesis can
be naturally viewed as constraint optimization
problems. We employ Integer Linear Program-
ming (ILP) as an optimization framework that
has been used successfully in other generation
tasks (e.g., Clarke and Lapata (2006), Mar-
tins and Smith (2009), Woodsend and Lapata
(2010)). Our ILP formulation encodes a rich
set of linguistically motivated constraints and
weights that incorporate multiple aspects of the
generation process. Empirical results demon-
strate that our final system generates linguisti-
cally more appealing and semantically more cor-
rect descriptions than two nontrivial baselines.
1.1 System Overview
Our system consists of two parts. For a query
image, we first retrieve candidate descriptive
phrases from a large image-caption database us-
ing measures of visual similarity (?2). We then
generate a coherent description from these can-
didates using ILP formulations for content plan-
ning (?4) and surface realization (?5).
2 Vision & Phrase Retrieval
For a query image, we retrieve relevant candi-
date natural language phrases by visually com-
paring the query image to database images from
the SBU Captioned Photo Collection (Ordonez
et al, 2011) (1 million photographs with asso-
ciated human-composed descriptions). Visual
similarity for several kinds of image content are
used to compare the query image to images from
the database, including: 1) object detections for
89 common object categories (Felzenszwalb et
al., 2010), 2) scene classifications for 26 com-
mon scene categories (Xiao et al, 2010), and
3) region based detections for stuff categories
(e.g. grass, road, sky) (Ordonez et al, 2011).
All content types are pre-computed on the mil-
lion database photos, and caption parsing is per-
formed using the Berkeley PCFG parser (Petrov
et al, 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007).
Given a query image, we identify content el-
ements present using the above classifiers and
detectors and then retrieve phrases referring to
those content elements from the database. For
example, if we detect a horse in a query im-
age, then we retrieve phrases referring to vi-
sually similar horses in the database by com-
paring the color, texture (Leung and Malik,
1999), or shape (Dalal and Triggs, 2005; Lowe,
2004) of the detected horse to detected horses
in the database images. We collect four types of
phrases for each query image as follows:
[1] NPs We retrieve noun phrases for each
query object detection (e.g., ?the brown cow?)
from database captions using visual similar-
ity between object detections computed as an
equally weighted linear combination of L2 dis-
360
tances on histograms of color, texton (Leung and
Malik, 1999), HoG (Dalal and Triggs, 2005) and
SIFT (Lowe, 2004) features.
[2] VPs We retrieve verb phrases for each
query object detection (e.g. ?boy running?)
from database captions using the same mea-
sure of visual similarity as for NPs, but restrict-
ing the search to only those database instances
whose captions contain a verb phrase referring
to the object category.
[3] Region/Stuff PPs We collect preposi-
tional phrases for each query stuff detection (e.g.
?in the sky?, ?on the road?) by measuring visual
similarity of appearance (color, texton, HoG)
and geometric configuration (object-stuff rela-
tive location and distance) between query and
database detections.
[4] Scene PPs We also collect prepositonal
phrases referring to general image scene context
(e.g. ?at the market?, ?on hot summer days?,
?in Sweden?) based on global scene similarity
computed using L2 distance between scene clas-
sification score vectors (Xiao et al, 2010) com-
puted on the query and database images.
3 Overview of ILP Formulation
For each image, we aim to generate multiple
sentences, each sentence corresponding to a sin-
gle distinct object detected in the given image.
Each sentence comprises of the NP for the main
object, and a subset of the corresponding VP,
region/stuff PP, and scene PP retrieved in ?2.
We consider four different types of operations
to generate the final description for each image:
T1. Selecting the set of objects to describe (one
object per sentence).
T2. Re-ordering sentences (i.e., re-ordering ob-
jects).
T3. Selecting the set of phrases for each sen-
tence.
T4. Re-ordering phrases within each sentence.
The ILP formulation of ?4 addresses T1 & T2,
i.e., content-planning, and the ILP of ?5 ad-
dresses T3 & T4, i.e., surface realization.1
1It is possible to create one conjoined ILP formulation
to address all four operations T1?T4 at once. For com-
4 Image-level Content Planning
First we describe image-level content planning,
i.e., abstract generation. The goals are to (1) se-
lect a subset of the objects based on saliency and
semantically compatibility, and (2) order the se-
lected objects based on their content relations.
4.1 Variables and Objective Function
The following set of indicator variables encodes
the selection of objects and ordering:
ysk =
?
?
?
1, if object s is selected
for position k
0, otherwise
(1)
where k = 1, ..., S encodes the position (order)
of the selected objects, and s indexes one of the
objects. In addition, we define a set of variables
indicating specific pairs of adjacent objects:
yskt(k+1) =
{
1, if ysk = yt(k+1) = 1
0, otherwise
(2)
The objective function, F , that we will maxi-
mize is a weighted linear combination of these
indicator variables and can be optimized using
integer linear programming:
F =
?
s
Fs ?
S?
k=1
ysk ?
?
st
Fst ?
S?1?
k=1
yskt(k+1) (3)
where Fs quantifies the salience/confidence of
the object s, and Fst quantifies the seman-
tic compatibility between the objects s and t.
These coefficients (weights) will be described in
?4.3 and ?4.4. We use IBM CPLEX to optimize
this objective function subject to the constraints
introduced next in ?4.2.
4.2 Constraints
Consistency Constraints: We enforce consis-
tency between indicator variables for indivisual
objects (Eq. 1) and consecutive objects (Eq. 2)
so that yskt(k+1) = 1 iff ysk = 1 and yt(k+1) = 1:
?stk, yskt(k+1) ? ysk (4)
yskt(k+1) ? yt(k+1) (5)
yskt(k+1) + (1? ysk) + (1? yt(k+1)) ? 1 (6)
putational and implementation efficiency however, we opt
for the two-step approach.
361
To avoid empty descriptions, we enforce that the
result includes at least one object:
?
s
ys1 = 1 (7)
To enforce contiguous positions be selected:
?k = 2, ..., S ? 1,
?
s
ys(k+1) ?
?
s
ysk (8)
Discourse constraints: To avoid spurious de-
scriptions, we allow at most two objects of the
same type, where cs is the type of object s:
?c ? objTypes,
?
{s: cs=c}
S?
k=1
ysk ? 2 (9)
4.3 Weight Fs: Object Detection
Confidence
In order to quantify the confidence of the object
detector for the object s, we define 0 ? Fs ? 1
as the mean of the detector scores for that object
type in the image.
4.4 Weight Fst: Ordering and
Compatibility
The weight 0 ? Fst ? 1 quantifies the compat-
ibility of the object pairing (s, t). Note that in
the objective function, we subtract this quan-
tity from the function to be maximized. This
way, we create a competing tension between the
single object selection scores and the pairwise
compatibility scores, so that variable number of
objects can be selected.
Object Ordering Statistics: People have bi-
ases on the order of topic or content flow. We
measure these biases by collecting statistics on
ordering of object names from the 1 million im-
age descriptions in the SBU Captioned Dataset
(Ordonez et al, 2011). Let ford(w1, w2) be
the number of times w1 appeared before w2.
For instance, ford(window, house) = 2895 and
ford(house, window) = 1250, suggesting that
people are more likely to mention a window be-
fore mentioning a house/building2. We use these
ordering statistics to enhance content flow. We
define score for the order of objects using Z-score
for normalization as follows:
F?st =
ford(cs, ct)?mean(ford)
std dev(ford)
(10)
2We take into account synonyms.
We then transform F?st so that F?st ? [0,1], and
then set Fst = 1 ? F?st so that smaller values
correspond to better choices.
5 Surface Realization
Recall that for each image, the computer vi-
sion system identifies phrases from descriptions
of images that are similar in a variety of aspects.
The result is a set of phrases representing four
different types of information (?2). From this
assortment of phrases, we aim to select a subset
and glue them together to compose a complete
sentence that is linguistically plausible and se-
mantically truthful to the content of the image.
5.1 Variables and Objective Function
The following set of variables encodes the selec-
tion of phrases and their ordering in construct-
ing S? sentences.
xsijk =
?
?????
?????
1, if phrase i of type j
is selected
for position k
in sentence s
0, otherwise
(11)
where k = 1, ..., N encodes the ordering of the
selected phrases, and j indexes one of the four
phrases types (object-NPs, action-VPs, region-
PPs, scene-PPs), i = 1, ...,M indexes one of
the M candidate phrases of each phrase type,
and s = 1, ..., S? encodes the sentence (object).
In addition, we define indicator variables for
adjacent pairs of phrases: xsijkpq(k+1) = 1 if
xsijk = xspq(k+1) = 1 and 0 otherwise. Finally,
we define the objective function F as:
F =
?
sij
Fsij ?
N?
k=1
xsijk
?
?
sijpq
Fsijpq ?
N?1?
k=1
xsijkpq(k+1) (12)
where Fsij weights individual phrase goodness
and Fsijpq adjacent phrase goodness. All coeffi-
cients (weights) will be described in Section 5.3
and 5.4.
We optionally prepend the first sentence in a
generated description with a cognitive phrase.3
3We collect most frequent 200 phrases of length 1-
7 that start a caption from the SBU Captioned Photo
Collection.

Figure 1: ILP & HMM generated captions. In HMM generated captions, underlined phrases show redundancy
across different objects (due to lack of discourse constraints), and phrases in boldface show awkward topic
flow (due to lack of content planning). Note that in the bicycle image, the visual recognizer detected two
separate bicycles and some fruits, as can be seen in the HMM result. Via collective image-level content
planning (see ?4), some of these erroneous detection can be corrected, as shown in the ILP result. Spurious
and redundant phrases can be suppressed via discourse constraints (see ?5).
These are generic constructs that are often used
to start a description about an image, for in-
stance, ?This is an image of...?. We treat these
phrases as an additional type, but omit corre-
sponding variables and constraints for brevity.
5.2 Constraints
Consistency Constraints: First we enforce
consistency between the unary variables (Eq.
11) and the pairwise variables so that xsijkpqm =
1 iff xsijk = 1 and xspqm = 1:
?ijkpqm, xsijkpqm ? xsijk (13)
xsijkpqm ? xspqm (14)
xsijkpqm + (1? xsijk) + (1? xspqm) ? 1 (15)
Next we include constraints similar to Eq. 8
(contiguous slots are filled), but omit them for
brevity. Finally, we add constraints to ensure at
least two phrases are selected for each sentence,
to promote informative descriptions.
Linguistic constraints: We include linguisti-
cally motivated constraints to generate syntacti-
cally and semantically plausible sentences. First
we enforce a noun-phrase to be selected to en-
sure semantic relevance to the image:
?s,
?
ik
xsiNPk = 1 (16)
Also, to avoid content redundancy, we allow at
most one phrase of each type:
?sj,
?
i
N?
k=1
xsijk ? 1 (17)
Discourse constraints: We allow at most
one prepositional scene phrase for the whole de-
scription to avoid redundancy:
For j = PPscene,
?
sik
xsijk ? 1 (18)
We add constraints that prevent the inclusion of
more than one phrase with identical head words:
?s, ij, pq with the same heads,
N?
k=1
xsijk +
N?
k=1
xspqk ? 1 (19)
5.3 Unary Phrase Selection
Let Msij be the confidence score for phrase
xsij given by the image?phrase matching al-
gorithm (?2). To make the scores across dif-
ferent phrase types comparable, we normalize
them using Z-score: Fsij = norm?(Msij) =
(Msij ? meanj)/devj , and then transform the
values into the range of [0,1].
5.4 Pairwise Phrase Cohesion
In this section, we describe the pairwise phrase
cohesion score Fsijpq defined for each xsijpq in
363
ILP: I like the way the clouds hanging down by 
the ground in Dupnitsa of Avikwalal. 
 
Human: Car was raised on the wall over a bridge 
facing traffic..paramedics were attending the 
driver on the ground 
ILP: This is a photo of this bird hopping 
around eating things off of the ground by 
river. 
Human: IMG_6892 Lookn up in the sky its a

ILP: This is a sporty little red convertible made for 
a great day in Key West FL. This car was in the 4th 
parade of the apartment buildings.

ILP: Taken in front of my cat sitting in a shoe 
box. Cat likes hanging around in my recliner.

warm Gatorade bottle of water (a small 
bottle wrapped in a rag) 
Figure 2: In some cases (16%), ILP generated captions were preferred over human written ones!
the objective function (Eq. 12). Via Fsijpq,
we aim to quantify the degree of syntactic and
semantic cohesion across two phrases xsij and
xspq. Note that we subtract this cohesion score
from the objective function. This trick helps the
ILP solver to generate sentences with varying
number of phrases, rather than always selecting
the maximum number of phrases allowed.
N-gram Cohesion Score: We use n-gram
statistics from the Google Web 1-T dataset
(Brants and Franz., 2006) Let Lsijpq be the set
of all n-grams (2 ? n ? 5) across xsij and xspq.
Then the n-gram cohesion score is computed as:
FNGRAMsijpq = 1?
?
l?Lsijpq
NPMI(l)
size(Lsijpq)
(20)
NPMI(ngr) =
PMI(ngr)? PMImin
PMImax ? PMImin
(21)
Where NPMI is the normalized point-wise mu-
tual information.4
Co-occurrence Cohesion Score: To cap-
ture long-distance cohesion, we introduce a co-
occurrence-based score, which measures order-
preserved co-occurrence statistics between the
head words hsij and hspq 5. Let f?(hsij , hspq)
be the sum frequency of all n-grams that start
with hsij , end with hspq and contain a prepo-
sition prep(spq) of the phrase spq. Then the
4We include the n-gram cohesion for the sentence
boundaries as well, by approximating statistics for sen-
tence boundaries with punctuation marks in the Google
Web 1-T data.
5For simplicity, we use the last word of a phrase as
the head word, except VPs where we take the main verb.
co-occurrence cohesion is computed as:
FCOsijpq =
max(f?)? f?(hsij , hspq)
max(f?)?min(f?)
(22)
Final Cohesion Score: Finally, the pairwise
phrase cohesion score Fijpq is a weighted sum of
n-gram and co-occurrence cohesion scores:
Fsijpq =
? ? FNGRAMsijpq + ? ? F
CO
sijpq
?+ ?
(23)
where ? and ? can be tuned via grid search,
and FNGRAMijpq and F
CO
ijpq are normalized ? [0, 1]
for comparability. Notice that Fsijpq is in the
range [0,1] as well.
6 Evaluation
TestSet: Because computer vision is a challeng-
ing and unsolved problem, we restrict our query
set to images where we have high confidence that
visual recognition algorithms perform well. We
collect 1000 test images by running a large num-
ber (89) of object detectors on 20,000 images
and selecting images that receive confident ob-
ject detection scores, with some preference for
images with multiple object detections to obtain
good examples for testing discourse constraints.
Baselines: We compare our ILP approaches
with two nontrivial baselines: the first is an
HMM approach (comparable to Yang et al
(2011)), which takes as input the same set of
candidate phrases described in ?2, but for de-
coding, we fix the ordering of phrases as [ NP
? VP ? Region PP ? Scene PP] and find the
best combination of phrases using the Viterbi
algorithm. We use the same rich set of pairwise

phrase cohesion scores (?5.4) used for the ILP
formulation, producing a strong baseline6.
The second baseline is a recent Retrieval
based description method (Ordonez et al, 2011),
that searches the large parallel corpus of im-
ages and captions, and transfers a caption from
a visually similar database image to the query.
This again is a very strong baseline, as it ex-
ploits the vast amount of image-caption data,
and produces a description high in linguistic
quality (since the captions were written by hu-
man annotators).
Automatic Evaluation: Automatically quan-
tifying the quality of machine generated sen-
tences is known to be difficult. BLEU score
(Papineni et al, 2002), despite its simplicity
and limitations, has been one of the common
choices for automatic evaluation of image de-
scriptions (Farhadi et al, 2010; Kulkarni et al,
2011; Li et al, 2011; Ordonez et al, 2011), as
it correlates reasonably well with human evalu-
ation (Belz and Reiter, 2006).
Table 1 shows the the BLEU @1 against the
original caption of 1000 images. We see that the
ILP improves the score over HMM consistently,
with or without the use of cognitive phrases.
6Including other long-distance scores in HMM decod-
ing would make the problem NP-hard and require more
sophisticated decoding, e.g. ILP.

Human Evaluation I ? Ranking: We com-
plement the automatic evaluation with Mechan-
ical Turk evaluation. In ranking evaluation, we
ask raters to choose a better caption between
two choices7. We do this rating with and with-
out showing the images, as summarized in Ta-
ble 2 & 3. When images are shown, raters evalu-
ate content relevance as well as linguistic quality
of the captions. Without images, raters evaluate
only linguistic quality.
We found that raters generally prefer ILP gen-
erated captions over HMM generated ones, twice
as much (67.2% ILP V.S. 32.8% HMM), if im-
ages are not presented. However the difference is
less pronounced when images are shown. There
could be two possible reasons. The first is that
when images are shown, the Turkers do not try
as hard to tell apart the subtle difference be-
tween the two imperfect captions. The second
is that the relative content relevance of ILP gen-
erated captions is negating the superiority in lin-
guistic quality. We explore this question using
multi-aspect rating, described below.
Note that ILP generated captions are exceed-
ingly (71.8 %) preferred over the Retrieval
baseline (Ordonez et al, 2011), despite the gen-
erated captions tendency to be more prone to
grammatical and cognitive errors than retrieved
ones. This indicates that the generated captions
must have substantially better content relevance
to the query image, supporting the direction of
this research. Finally, notice that as much as
16% of the time, ILP generated captions are pre-
ferred over the original human generated ones
(examples in Figure 2).

aspects: grammar, cognitive correctness,8 and
relevance. We find that ILP improves over HMM
in all aspects, however, the relevance score is no-
ticeably worse than scores of two other criteria.
It turns out human raters are generally more
critical against the relevance aspect, as can be
seen in the ratings given to the original human
generated captions.
Discussion with Examples: Figure 1 shows
contrastive examples of HMM vs ILP gener-
ated captions. Notice that HMM captions
look robotic, containing spurious and redundant
phrases due to lack of discourse constraints, and
often discussing an awkward set of objects due
to lack of image-level content planning. Also
notice how image-level content planning under-
pinned by language statistics helps correct some
of the erroneous vision detections. Figure 3
shows some example mistakes in the ILP gen-
erated captions.
7 Related Work & Discussion
Although not directly focused on image descrip-
tion generation, some previous work in the realm
of summarization shares the similar problem of
content planning and surface realization. There
8E.g., ?A desk on top of a cat? is grammatically cor-
rect, but cognitively absurd.
are subtle, but important differences however.
First, sentence compression is hardly the goal
of image description generation, as human writ-
ten descriptions are not necessarily succinct.9
Second, unlike summarization, we are not given
with a set of coherent text snippet to begin with,
and the level of noise coming from the visual
recognition errors is much higher than that of
starting with clean text. As a result, choosing
an additional phrase in the image description is
much riskier than it is in summarization.
Some recent research proposed very elegant
approaches to summarization using ILP for col-
lective content planning and/or surface realiza-
tion (e.g., Martins and Smith (2009), Woodsend
and Lapata (2010), Woodsend et al (2010)).
Perhaps the most important difference in our
approach is the use of negative weights in the
objective function to create the necessary ten-
sion between selection (salience) and compatibil-
ity, which makes it possible for ILP to generate
variable length descriptions, effectively correct-
ing some of the erroneous vision detections. In
contrast, all previous work operates with a pre-
defined upper limit in length, hence the ILP was
formulated to include as many textual units as
possible modulo constraints.
To conclude, we have presented a collective
approach to generating natural image descrip-
tions. Our approach is the first to systematically
incorporate state of the art computer vision
to retrieve visually relevant candidate phrases,
then produce images descriptions that are sub-
stantially more complex and human-like than
previous attempts.

9On a related note, the notion of saliency also differs
in that human written captions often digress on details
that might be tangential to the visible content of the
image. E.g., ?This is a dress my mom made.?, where the
picture does not show a woman making the dress.
