We hypothesise that agents who engage in task- contains 128 such dialogues; in this work we examined 
oriented ialogue usually try to complete the task with eight plus a set of dialogues from the pilot study used 
the least effort which will produce a satisfactory so- in Shadbolt 's work \[17\]. Agents who wish to avoid plan 
lution. Our analysis of a corpus of map navigation 
task dialogues hows that there are a number of dif- 
ferent aspects of dialogue for which agents can choose 
either to expend extra effort when they produce their 
initial utterances, or to take the risk that they will 
have to recover from a failure in the dialogue. Some 
of these decisions and the strategies which agents use 
to recover from failures due to high risk choices are 
simulated in the JAM system. The human agents of 
the corpus purposely risk failure because this is gen- 
erally the most efficient behaviour. Incorporating the 
same behaviour in the JAM system produces dialogue 
with more "natural" structure than that of traditional 
dialogue systems. 
In t roduct ion  
There are a great number of different dialogue styles 
which people use even in very restricted task.oriented 
domains. Agents can choose different levels of speci- 
ficity for referring expressions, ways of organising de- 
scriptions, amounts of feedback, complexities of expla- 
nation, and so on. This work first identifies a number 
of aspects of task-oriented dialogue along which agents 
can make choices and identifies these choices in terms 
of how much effort the agent must expend in order to 
generate utterances in line with them. In general, ex- 
pending more effort in building an explanation means 
that the explalnee is more likely to understand it as 
is; thus we can classify some choices as being "higher 
risk" than those which take more effort to generate but 
which are more likely to succeed on the first attempt. 
Then it identifies a number of recovery strategies which 
agents use when risky hehaviour has led to a failure in 
the dialogue. The choices which agents make show n 
trade-off of when effort is expended in the dialogue; 
agents can either expend effort early in order to head 
off later difficulty, or take the risk of having to expend 
more effort in an attempt at recovery. For instance, 
consider the domain, first described in \[5\], in which 
two participants who are separated by a partition have 
slightly different versions of a simple map with approx- 
imately fifteen gross features on it. The maps may have 
different features or have some of the features in dif- 
ferent locations. In addition, one agent has a route 
drawn on the map. The task is for the second agent o

dentship from the M~trshMl Aid Commemoration Commis-

failure may structure their explanations carefully and 
elicit feedback often, hehaving similarly to agent A in 
Shadbolt's example 6.16: 
A: have you got wee palm trees aye? 
B: uhu 
A: right go just + a wee bit along to them have 
you got a swamp? 
B: er 
A: right well just go + have yon got a waterfall? 
On the other hand, agents who are willing to rely 
on interruptions from the partner and recovery from 
failure might behave more like agent A in Shadbolt's 
example 6.11: 
A: and then + go up about and over the bridge 
B: I've not got a bridge I've got a lion's den and a 
wood 
A: have you got a river? 
Either of these approaches is likely to bring the 
agents to successful completion of the task. However, 
it is also possible to include too little information in the 
dialogue, as in the following case, Shadholt's example 
6.21: 
A: right + you're going to have to cro~ the river 
B: how? 
A: dinnae ken + any way you want... 
It is equally possible to give too much information, 
as in Shadbolt's example 6.27: 
B: ah right + erm + oh yes + er + I have a crashed 
plane marked here + can I + check this + my 
crashed plane is ABOVE + it's in the BASE 
of the quadrant + top right hand imaginary 
quadrant of the + erm + picture + yes er + 
that SOUNDS too high for me + 
A: er 
In this case, B provides o much information that A 
is unable to process it, and they eventually abandon 
this section of the dialogue. This work looks at the dif- 
ferences between the approaches which human agents 
use to complete the map task and simulates them using 
the JAM system. Understanding and comparing the 
different human approaches to task-oriented ialogue 
can help us to create more robust computer dialogue 
agents. 
Communicat ive  Posture  
Our work extends Shadbolt's analysis of the map task 
data \[17\]. He identifies a number of "communica- 
tive posture parameters" or aspects of the dialogue for 
AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~ 1992 8 9 6 PROC. OP COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28. 1992 
which an agent may make tit(-" choice of how to proceed, 
and classifies the possible settings in ternm of risk: for 
the most part, high risk settings leave the partner to 
infer information aml risk the possibility of plan fail- 
ure, while low risk settings are more likely to work as 
planned, lie then argues that hmnan agents decide 
upon their communicative postures according to the 
Principle of Parsimony, which is "a behavioural princio 
pie which instructs processors to do no more processing 
than is necessary to achieve a goal." (pg. 342) Agents 
choose the settings for each individual parameter which 
they believe will prove most etlicient. Shadbolt identi- 
fies seven different communicative posture parameters. 
Our own analysis extends tds by 
clearly separating out aspects of being a hearer from 
those of being a listener mt~l 
hy making the behaviour ofthe parameters more in~ 
dcl)endcnt of each other mid subsequently dividing 
them into sets dcpcnding on which part of an agent's 
planning they affect. Wc divide utterance planning 
into diffcrcnt stages similar to Appelt's \[4\] for this 
part of the analysis. 
The following revised set i)rovides a more solid foun.. 
dation on which to build the implementation found in 
the JAM system: 
Task P lann ing  Parameters  
'.l'hese parameters affect which task plan an agent 
chooses. In the map domain, task plans determine the 
choice of descriptions for sections of the route and for 
the location of objects. 
Onto logy:  Thc choice of concepts to use when build- 
ins an explanation, lligh risk agents construct sim- 
ple and short descriptions, providing ms littlc infof  
lnation as they think the partner will allow, willie 
low risk agents provide precise, detailed explauatioas 
even if that involves using fairly COml)lex background 
concepts and introducing new concepts into the dia- 
logue. 
Onto log ica l  l~esolution: The choice of concepts to 
ask about when hearing an explanation, l\[igh risk 
agents asccpt the level of detail which is off~red to 
them, wbile low risk ones ask how concepts are re- 
lated if they think that the relationship may be an 
important piece of background for tim explanation. 
Par tner  Mode l l ing :  Wltether or not to heed a model 
of the partner while building an explanation. High 
risk agents do not, while low risk agents do, tailoring 
tile explanation f(u" the partner. It takes more effort 
in the first instance to buihl an explanation which is 
tailored to the partner, but the explanation is more 
likely to succeed without revisions. 
Ontology and partner modelling are implemented in
tile J AM system by means of an evaluation selmme 
for possible task plans which rates descriptions dif- 
ferently (let)ca(ling on whether these parmneters are 
set to low or high risk. Low risk ontology prefers de- 
scriptions which rcfer to many map objects over sim- 
pler ones; if there arc sevcral descriptions of equal 
complexity, low risk l)artocr modelling prefers de- 
scril)tions which (Io not refer to map objects that 
may I)c unknown to the partner. Ontological r(~)lu- 
Lion is not irnp\]enlente(l in tile JAM system because 
JAM agents are not capable of the spatial reasoning 
required to determine what other map objects are 
relevaat o a given description. 
D iscourse  P lann ing  Parameters  
These parameters affect the structure of the dim 
course, given the information from the task plan which 
numt be conveyed. 
Di f ference:  Whether or not agents assume that their 
modeln of the domain are the stone unless proven oth- 
erwise. High risk agents make this assumption, while 
low risk agents do not, making them precede new 
concepts in the dialogam with subdialogues which es- 
tablish certain knowledge of the partner's knowledge 
such as direct questions about the status of the con- 
cepts. A low risk difference setting makes the (lia~ 
logue longer and hence requires more effort, but ales 
provides a greater strength of evidence about the 
partner's beliefs \[7\] than does relying on the part- 
her's feedback to the explanation itself. This param- 
eter is implemented in the JAM system by means of 
optional prerequisites on discourse plans which in- 
troduce new concepts; low risk agents expand the 
prerequisites, while high risk agents do not. 
Coherence:  Whether or not the agents orgauisc their 
diseourse coherently, lligh risk agents produce utter- 
ances in whatever ordcr they think of thcm, whereas 
low risk agents try to order them in some way which 
will make the discourse ~icr  for the partner. This 
parameter is not implenmnted in the JAM system 
because, map task participants do not often organise 
the discourse xcept as if they were physically fol- 
lowing the route. In less well structured omains, it 
could be implemented using, for instance, RST \[11\] 
or focus trees \[12\]. 
Ut terance  Rea l l sa t ion  Parameters  
Thrum parameters affect the way in which each ut 
terance in the given discourse structure is realised or 
understood. 
Context  Ar t ieu la t lon :  Whether or not the agents 
signal awkward context shifts, llere context is 
loosely dcfincd as tile goM which is supported by 
the current part of the dialogue; in the map task, 
contexts carl either be goals of sharing knowledge 
about a section of tile route or tim location of an 
object, tligh risk agents do not signal awkward con- 
text shifts, while low risk agents use mcta~comments, 
changes in diction, or sot\[m other means to mark 
tile new context. A limited version of the low risk 
setting is imphmmnted in JAM which introduces a
reels-comment into the dialogue whenevcr a context 
shift occurs. 
Context  ILesolufion: Whether or not agents ask for 
clarification of awkward context shifts. Low risk 
agents ask tile partner what the current context is 
or make their assumptions clear when they are un- 
sure, whereas high risk agents simply choose the 
most likely context. This parameter is not imple- 
mented in the JAM system because JAM agents use 
a language which (tt~s not allow for ambiguity of 
context. 
~'ocus Ar t i cu la t ion :  Wllether or not agents signal 
awkward focus shifts, liere, focus is defined specifi- 
cally for tile map task in terms of distance on the 
ACYES DE COl,INGo92, NANrEs. 23 28 AO~"H 1992 8 9 7 Ptto(:, OF COI,IN(I-92, NANrES. AUU. 23-28, 1992 
map and semantic relationships among map iea~ 
tures. Low risk agents use meta-comments or modi- 
tiers on referring expressions to signal awkward focus 
changes, and high risk agents do not. Focus articula~ 
tion is not implemented in the \]\[AM system because 
JAM agents are not capable of the spatial or seman- 
tic reasoning required to calculate focus; given these 
abilities, low risk agents could use some theory of 
how focus usually moves (such as that of Grosz and 
Sidner \[9\]) to determine whether or not signaling a 
particular shift is necessary. 
Focus Reso lut ion :  Whether or not agents ask for 
clarification of awkward focus shifts. Low risk agents 
ask the partner what the current focus is or mark 
their assumptions in some other way, whereas high 
risk agents imply choose the most likely focus. Low 
risk focus resolution could be implemented by hay- 
ing low risk agents ask for clarification whenever a
focus shift does not conform to sonm theory of focus, 
with high risk agents "guessing" the current focus. 
Speci f icat ion:  Whether or not agents construct refer- 
ring expressions carcfidty. Low risk agents generate 
referring expressions which are roughly minimally 
unique, whereas ifigh risk agents generate whatever 
expression comes to mind, even if that expression 
is under- or over-specific. This parameter could be 
implemented in the JAM system nsing, for instance, 
work by Dale \[8\] and Reiter \[16\]. 
Descr ip t ion  Reso lut ion :  Whether or not agents de- 
code referring expressions carefully. Low risk agents 
ask for clarification of ambiguous referring expres- 
sions, while high risk agents simply choose the 
mostly likely referent. This parameter could have 
an implementation similar to that of the specifica- 
tion parameter, but from the point of view of the 
addressee. 
Meta -P lann ing  Parameter  
This parameter affects an agent's choice of how to con- 
tinue from the current situation in a dialogue. 
P lan  Commitment :  Whether or not agents decide 
to replan easily. Low risk agents tend to stick to 
the current plan unless there is sufficient proof that 
tile new plan is better, whereas high risk agents of_ 
ten replan when they encounter failures even with- 
out carefully checking the viability of the new plan. 
Frequent changes in plans are likely to confuse the 
partner and lead to difficulty in the dialogue, espe- 
cially if the agent's context ~ticulation setting is 
also high risk. This parameter is implemented in the 
JAM system by means of a "replanning threshold" 
which is added to tile estimated cost of a replan and 
which makes replanning seem less efficient o low risk 
agents that to high risk ones. 
Of course, the choice is not between extremes, but 
among points on a spectrum which generally reflects 
the amount of effort to be expended. Shadbolt adapts 
the Principle of Parsimony to state that agents make 
the choices which they believe will lead to the lowest ef- 
fort solution for the entire task. In each case, high risk 
agents may lose the efficiency advantage which they 
gained by using less effort initially, if their plans fail 
and they have to expend more effort to recover from 
the failures. Recovery strategies are more often needed 
by high risk agents than by low risk ones. 
Recovery  S t ra teg ies  
Our analysis has uncovered the following recovery 
strategies. Some strategies are only first steps towards 
finding a solution for the failure, mid one, goal adop- 
tion, is also useful in other circumstances. We use the 
same basic definitions for repair and replanuing as in 
Moore's work \[13\]. 
Goa l  Adopt ion :  The agent may infer the partner's 
goals from sonm part of the dialogue he or she has 
initiated and adopt them as his or her own. 
Ced ing  the  Turn :  The agent may simply not take 
any action and hope that his or her inaction will 
force the partner into initiating the recovery. 
E laborat ion :  If an explanation has not been given in 
enough detail, the explainer may fill in the gaps. 
Omiss ion:  If an explanation has been given in too 
nmch detail, the agents may agree to discard some 
of the information. This is especially useful in the 
map task if some description of the route or of the 
location of an object OIL the map turns out to hold 
for one version of the map but not the other. 
Repet i t ion :  Under any circumstances, an agent may 
simply repeat whatever action has already failed ill 
the hopes that it will work the subsequent tinve. 
Ignor ing  the  Problean:  An agent may ignore a 
problem and hope that it will disappear. 
Repa i r :  If a plan has failed, then checking each of the 
prerequisites of the plan ill turn to see if they are 
satisfied may lead to a diagnosis. In the map task, 
plan prerequisites have to do with knowledge about 
objects on the map. A plan will fail if an agent pre- 
supposes that the partner has knowledge which he or 
stle does not have. Since the knowledge transferred 
in the map domain is so simple, it is sufficient in a 
repair to re-execute any failed prerequisites, even if 
the plan has already been completely executed. 
Rep lannh ig :  If a plan has failed, then an agent may 
attempt an entirely different plan with the same ef- 
fect. In the map task, this involves using a different 
description for the information under consideration 
or trying a different approach altogether. 
There are many past systems which have incorpo- 
rated some form of recovery from plan failure (e.g., \[2\], 
\[19\], \[14\]). However, very little work has been done on 
incorporating more than one recovery strategy into tile 
same system. Moore's \[13\] work allows the use of re- 
pair, reinstantiation, aud replanning, but uses a strict 
ordering on these strategies to determine which one to 
try next. Moore's system first attempts any poesible 
repairs, then any reinstantiations, and then, only as a 
last resort, replanning. Neither Moore's ordering nor 
any other can account for the variety of behaviours 
which is present in the human map task corpus. In ad- 
dition, Moore's system only considers replanning when 
there has been a plan failure, whereas human agents 
sometimes switch plans when they flesh out enough of 
the details and discover that the plans which they have 
adopted are leas efficient han they had expected. The 
solution to these shortcomings i  to invoke the Princi- 
ple of Parsimony and to allow agents at every choice 
point to decide what to do next based on an estimates

of how much effort the remainder of the task will re- 
quire given each of the possible next actions. This ap- 
proach is adopted in the JAM system. 
The  JAM System 
The JAM system allows agents to converse about the 
map task by alternating control between them, follow.~ 
ing Power \[15\]. Agents converse in an artificial an- 
guagc which is based on Houghton's \[10\] interaction 
frames; these frames pecify the forms of two and three 
move dialogue games for informing, asking wh- and yes- 
no- questions, opening a subdialogue with a particular 
topic, and closing a recovery, and also gives plausible 
belief updates associated with each. An English-like 
gloss is provided for the benefit of the human observer 
only by means of very simple template. Unlike the hu- 
mans, JAM agents have their conununicative postures 
set before the beginning of a dialogue and can not vary 
them during its course. Each agent uses five commu- 
nicative posture parameters (ontology, partner mod- 
elling, context articulation, difference, and plan com- 
mitment) and three recovery strategies (goal adoption, 
repair, and replanning). Space will not permit a de- 
scription of how the parameters arc implemented; for 
more details ee \[6\]. The recovery strategies are imple- 
mented within a layered message-passing architecture 
shown in figure I and adapted from MOLGEN \[18\]. 
At each layer of the system, operators use the next 
layer down in order to decide whether or not they arc 
applicable and how to apply themselves. The bottom 
layer of the system contains plan operators which ax- 
iomatise the domain knowledge and the meanings of 
the dialogue gaines. The strategy layer contains oper- 
ators expressing all of the different actions which an 
agent cart take next in the current situation: agents 
can decide to communicate, infer and adopt one of 
the partner's goals, plan, replan, or repair. The mode 
layer contains operators which control which strategy 
is chosen. The mode operator of most concern to us is 
the comprehensive mode, which always communicates 
whenever it has something to say, goal adopts whenever 
it can recognise one of the partner's intentions (using 
a siraplified version of Allen's plan recogniser \[1\]), and 
chooses whether to plan, replan, or repair based on 
an estimate of the effort needed to complete the entire 
task if each of the options is taken ncz~ (for details, 
see \[6\]). There are also other modes which eliminate 
some of the recovery strategies in order to make exper- 
imentation with the strategies easier, and one mode 
which reconstructs as far as possible the choices which 
Moore's system \[13\] makes. Finally, the interpreter 
chooses one of the mode level operators for the dura- 
tion of the dialogue. If a theory of how agents include 
and exclude consideration of different recovery strate- 
gies were available, it could be implemented in the in- 
terpreter and more layers could be added to the system 
as needed. 
Examples  
The JAM system generates the following dialogue x- 
tract between two agents who both have totally low 
risk communicative posture settings: 
mary: i want to talk about the first section. 
john: ok. 
mary: do you have the palm beach? 
john: yes. 
mary: do you have the swamp? 
john: no. 
mary: i want to talk about the swamp. 
john: ok. 
mary: do you have the waterfall? 
john: yes. 
mary: the swamp is between the waterfall and the 
palm beach. 
john: ok. 
mary: the first section of the route goes between 
the palm beach and the swamp. 
john: ok. 
In this extract, a low risk context articulation setting 
leads mary to open the dialogue about each distinct 
topic (the first section of the route and the swamp). 
Low risk ontology causes her to chooee her to choo~ 
fairly complex descriptions of the first section of the 
route and the location of the swamp (at least for JAM 
agents), and low risk difference makes her ask john 
whether or not he has all of the prerequisite knowledge 
before she gives any descriptions. Finally, low risk plan 
commitment causes her not to to abandon her descrip- 
tion of the first section of the route when she discovers 
that john's map does not have the swamp. If we rnn 
the same dialogue, but replace mary with an agent who 
has high risk plan commitment and context articula- 
tion settings, then the structure of the dialogue changes 
completely: 
janet: do you have the palm beach? 
john: yes. 
janet: do you have the swamp? 
john: no. 
janet: the first section of the route goes to the left 
of the palm beach. 
john: ok. 
In this case, although janet begins using the same 
plan as mary had, as she explores this plan she dis- 
covers that it will not work and decides that it will be 
le~ costly simply to abandon it for a description which 
does not mention the swamp. In another example, two 
ACRES DE COLING-92, NAhT~S. 23-28 Ao~rr 1992 8 9 9 Paoc. ol: COLING-92, NArCr~s. Auo. 23-28, 1992 
agents with high risk settings for context articulation, 
difference, and plan commitment also successfully corm 
plete this section of the route, but only by having a plan 
failure occur and invoking the repair recovery strategy: 
carol: the first section of the route goes between 
the palm beach and the swamp. 
tom: i do not understand. 
tom: where is the swamp? 
carol: the swamp is between the waterfall and the 
palm beach. 
tom: ok. 
tom: i am done talking about the first section. 
carol: ok. 
In this dialogue, tom infers that carol has the goal for 
tom to know how to get around the first section of the 
route from her initial statement, adopts it, and then 
diagnoses the failure of prerequisite knowledge about 
the swamp in order to repair her plan. He chooses this 
course of action because he believes it will take less 
effort than the other possibilities (in this case, sim- 
ply telling carol he does not understand her statement 
without diagnosing the problem and allowing her to 
provide a different description of the first section). This 
failure came about as a result of carol's high risk differ- 
ence setting, since a low risk difference setting would 
have made carol ask tom ahead about his knowledge, 
a.s mary did for john. Using agents with different com- 
municative postures and interpreters allows the JAM 
system to simulate many different behaviours which 
can be recognised in the human corpus. 
Conc lus ions  
We demonstrate a number of aspects of dialogue for 
which agents must choose between expending effort 
when they create their initial utterances and taking 
the risk of plan failure, and go on to describe a num- 
ber of strategies which high risk agents use to recover 
from failure. A surprising outcome of the human ex- 
amples is that it is often most parsimonious to risk fail- 
ure. Agents quickly reach the limits of their resource 
bounds when they try to avoid possible confusions in 
the dialogue, and dialogue is such a flexible medium 
that recovery is relatively inexpensive. In other words, 
although their behaviour may make them seem to fail 
to plan, human agents really plan to fail because it 
is more eMcient to do so in the long run. Computer 
agents who are to interact with human ones should 
take this into account when they react to their part- 
ners' contributions, and it might even be desirable for 
them to adopt this approach themselves. In addition 
to the analysis, we simulate some of the choices which 
human agents make using conversations between two 
computer agents in the JAM system. These agents, 
given particular communicative posture choices, try to 
minimise the total effort that will be expended in the 
dialogue by always considering all possible actions and 
taking whichever one they believe will lead to tim least 
cost completion of the dialogue. We leave to further 
work extensions which would allow the agents to de- 
cide not to deliberate about what to do completely, 
just taking the first action which they "think" of, and 
which would allow the agents to vary their communica- 
tive postures during the course of a dialogue.
