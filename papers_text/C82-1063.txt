Methodology and results of complex computational 
analysis of present-day standard Czech are pre- 
sented. According to computer programmes various 
linguistic observations were achieved, concerning 
especial ly dependency syntax. 
INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this paper is to present the methodology and results 
of a detailed analysis of syntactic structures in Czech, perfor- 
med with the aid of computer. This work is a part of a large and 
long-term project, known as Quantitative analysis of present-day 
standard Czech, which is carried out in the Department of mathe- 
matical l inguistics at the Czech language Institute under the 
leadership of M. T~i te lova  ~1 ~, \[2\]. Some hitherto achieved re- 
sults have already been published in special monographs /e.g. the 
frequency dict ionaries of publicist and administrat ive styles \[31, 
t4\], a volume of quantitative characterist ics of publicist style 
\[5\]- these prints were issued by the Czech language Institute, 
Prague/ or as articles and papers e.g. in PBML 31 and 32 \[6\] and 
PSML 7 and 8 tT\]; other articles are to be published within a short 
time /as e.g. the frequency dictionary of scientif ic Czech/ or they 
have been already prepared for publication. 
PROPOSITIONS AND SYNTACTIC CODE 
The target of the syntactic analysis as well as of the whole pro- 
ject is to obtain a coherent set of mutually related quantitative 
parameters concerning the Czech language system, its functioning 
in different communicative spheres, as well as its stylistic va- 
lues. To guarantee the reliabil ity and representativeness of re-

sults, the research is based on the corpt;s of 540 000 word-forms 
/occurrences/ chosen from non-narrat ive /i.e. newspaper, administra- 
tive and scientific/ texts. During the preparatory works all word- 
-forms in 180 samples - each sample consisting of 3000 running 
word-forms - were supplied with a special code carrying both mor- 
phological and syntactic information about parts of speech, all 
main morphological  categories, relevant in Czech /such as case, 
nominal gender and number, person, number, tense, mood, voice of 
verbs etc. with a very detailed subcategorization/ and all main 
syntactic categories /such as subject, object, predicate, attributes 
types of adverbials etc., again with the necessary subcategories/.  
The syntactic code was basically digital, with three exceptions: 
the characters "+" and "-" expressed whether the dependent senten- 
ce element follows or precedes the governing word /sentence member/, 
and the character "!" was used for special defective sentence con- 
structions. For purposes of frequency lists, each word-form was 
given a basic lexical information /lemma/. 
The coding and lemmatization was done by Linguists in such a way, 
that after marking boundaries between sentences and clauses each 
word-form was given information about its syntactic function 
/"membership in sentence"/ and about its governing word in the de- 
pendency tree. Each clause was then given information about its 
structural position in the complex or compound sentence~ then 
coordination between words or between clauses was marked; finally, 
information about the linear arrangement of words in sentences, 
of clauses in complex and compound sentences, and of sentence who- 
les in text was added, so as to enable the complete reconstruction 
of running texts by computer, if necessary, at any time. 
The whole corpus  together  w i th  the  encoded in fo rmat ion  came by 
means of  punched cards  /80 co lumns/  over  a cur rent  input  programme 
in to  externa l  computer  memory on magnet ic  tapes  /each  tape  L ib rary  
can car ry  max. 30 texts ,  the  whole corpus  i s  conta ined  in  7 tapes / .  
Each record  got  a spec ia l  t rans la t ion  zone to  guarantee  the  poss i -  
b i l i ty  of  ob l igatory  /non-s tandard /  sor t ing  w i th  respect  to  d i f fe -  
rent  a lphabet ic  o rder ing  of  some Czech Let te rs  / record  s i ze  on ta -

executed  at  the  computer  TESLA 200 in  the  computer -centers  OTZ~HT 
and OFPL, CzechosLovak  Academy of  Sc iences ,  a l l  programmes and

their modif ications were written in internal programming language 
"APS". 
The survey of the main results, given below, is ordered from the 
most simple to the more complicated ones, with respect to the com- 
puter programmes and with respect to the linguistic information 
obtained. 
SIMPLE COMPUTATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
The first set of programmes gives by its simple structure as to 
the programming technique the essential totals of frequencies /oc- 
currences/ of encoded syntactic categories, individual syntactic 
features and various items under investigation. Number of results 
of this kind was obtained by means of reading or repeated reading 
of the magnetic tape library and through simple adding of different 
code items. 
The received data offer us a basic survey about the frequencies of 
sentence elements and simple, complex and compound sentences, 
about types of syntagms /both determinative and coordinative/, 
about the frequencies of two-element and one-element sentences and 
their patterns, about the frequencies of types of subordinate 
clauses, some word-order and clause-order characterist ics and the 
frequency ratio of simple and complex/compound sentences. In addi- 
tion, there have been collected some data concerning how often 
various sentence elements are expressed by a nominal or an adver -  
bial phrase and how often they are expressed by a dependent clause, 
concerning the most frequent types of complex sentences, including 
frequencies and functions of various syntactic connectors. Using 
the cycles within counting programmes the distr ibutions of syntac- 
tic units were obtained in a similarly simple and prompt way. 
This part of the computer work yielded the length distr ibutions of 
clauses and sentences expressed in number of words, or in number 
of clauses. 
COMPOUND COMPUTATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
By doubling or chaining of testing subprogrammes and cycles another 
set of programmes was constructed for more complicated searching 
and output of syntactic characteristics. Special ly commented tab-

les, as well as larger sets of numeric data supplying rich material 
for further steps of analysis were obtained. Whereas the results 
of the programme set mentioned above referred to frequencies of 
individual syntactic categories, the programmes reported about in 
this paragraph were concentrated on their relationships. Atten- 
tion was paid especial ly to the relationships between syntactic 
elements and their part-of-speech appurtenance, to the syntactic 
relevance of some morphological  categories /e.g. of noun cases/, 
to the correlation between sentence length and complexity of its 
structure, to the relationship between types of subordinate clau- 
ses and their linear position in complex sentences etc. Some of 
the statist ical data obtained have confirmed our intuitive expec- 
tations /e.g. concerning syntactic functions of parts of speech 
and syntactic functions of cases of nouns/, others lead us to 
a deeper insight into interrelat ions between linguistic levels, 
esp. about the connection between the lexical and the syntactic 
levels. 
TYPES OF VERBAL CONTEXTS SEARCHED BY COMPUTER 
Using the computer operation memory we overcame the technical im- 
possibit i ty of a reverse magnetic tape reading. This enabled us to 
prepare the third set of 
output we received whole 
nents with required code 
programmes with many variations. As an 
sentences, sentence types or their compo- 
combinations or with immediate verbal 
contexts. Thus we could study not only abstract syntactic catego- 
ries as such, reported above, but we also could take into account 
the concrete lexical manifestat ions of various syntactic elements, 
units and categories. 
Some interesting tendencies were found, concerning the insertion 
of certain lexical types into different syntactic positions, e.g. 
types of adjectives typical for predicative posit ions and other 
typical for attr ibutive positions. The relationship between the 
semantics of the co-ordinated syntactic elements and their functions 
in topic-comment structure was studied, the correlation between 
the frequencies of subordinate clauses and lexical semantics of 
the governing predicate was proved /with predicates expressing 
the attitude of the speaker to the content of communication/,  the 
correlation between morphological  category of infinit ive and se- 
mantic category of modality was found. A special attention was

paid to the syntactic structures with verbs to be and to have. 
MAIN RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES 
The hitherto made experiences have shown that even a very extensi- 
ve statist ico- l inguist ic project can be successful ly carried 
through, if ~here is the aid of computer. Results obtained up to 
now offer a very detailed picture about the functional load of syn- 
tactic elements and units in texts from various styles and from va- 
rious communicative spheres of the present-day Czech. However, the 
importance of the project, which has not yet been completely finis- 
hed, consists also in the recognition and understanding of quanti- 
tative linguistic principles, relationships, tendencies and gene- 
ral laws. 
Statistics of syntax contrasts by some of its features with the 
statistics of other linguistic levels. If compared with some 
hierarchical ly lower levels, such as with phonology or morphology, 
and their units, the sentence as the basic syntactic unit is 
structural ly much more complex /not representing the mere summ of 
elements and forms of the lower levels/ and, larger, too. For 
these reasons it disposes with a considerably higher combination 
possibi l it ies, and consequently of richer posibi l i t ies of indivi- 
dual usage of linguistic means of its creation and usage during 
the communicative process. On the other hand, if compared with 
concrete lexical items, most properties of sentence are of abst- 
ract, categorial nature; the inventory of sentence patterns is 
strictly limited in number, and therefore they are repeated very 
often in texts, which of course contributes to the neutral izat ion 
of their st~listic value. 
The computer aided quantitative analysis of syntax proved to be 
a valuable counterpart of qualitative structural research in descri- 
bing and evaluating the functioning of language means in communi- 
cation.
