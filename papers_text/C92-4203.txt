This paper describes a Japanese-English translation 
aid system, C'I'M, which has a usefid capability for 
flexible retrieval of texts from hilingaal corpora or 
translation databases. Translation examples (pairs 
of a text and its translation equivalent) are very 
helpful for us to translate the similar text. Our 
character-based best match retrieval method can re: 
trieve translation examples imilar to the given input. 
This method has the following advantages: (1) this 
method accepts free-style translation examples, i.e., 
pairs of any text string and its translation equiva- 
lent, (2) morphological analysis is unnecessary, (3) 
this method accepts fl'ce-Myle inlmts (i.e., any text 
strings) for retrieval. We show the retrieval examples 
with the following characteristic features: phrasal ex- 
pression, long-distance dependency, idiom, synonym, 
mad semantic ambiguity. 
1 In t roduct ion  
In the late 1980's, several commercial Japanese- 
English machine translation systems had heen devel- 
oped in Japan, In these systems, the computer is the 
agent of translation, while the user assists in editing 
the translation inputs and revising the results. Al- 
though they are usefal to translate large amounts of 
texts roughly and rapidly, high quality translation is 
impossible. 
T rans la t ion  aM is another kind of machine trans- 
lation: the user is the agent of translation, while the 
computer provides him or her with the helpfifl tools, 
e.g., quick-retrieval electronic dictionaries. A quick- 
retrieval bilingual corpus is also usefifl, specifically 
when it h,'~s the flexihle (best match) retrieval mech- 
anism. Because translatiml examples (pairs of source 
text, and its translation equivalent) are very helpful 
for us to translate the similar text. This type of sys- 
tem is called a~ example-based translalion aid \[6\], and 
there are two prototype systems in Japanese-English 
translation: ETOC \[8\] and Nakanmra's ystem \[5\].

Figure h B~ic Configuration of Example-B,'Lsed 
Translation Aid 
Figure I shows the basic configuration of example- 
ha~ed translation aid (EI~TA). It consists of two com- 
ponents: the t rans la t ion  database  is the collection 
of translation examples, and the best  match  re- 
t r ieva l  engine is to retrieve the example that is the 
most similar to the given input text. The character- 
istic of the EBTA system is that it accepts free-style 
texl inputs for the retrieval: it frees the user from 
learning the tbrmal language for datah,~se query. 
'l'he central problem in EBTA is the implementa- 
tion of the hest match retrieval. Two methods were 
proposed: one is the syntax-matching driven by gen- 
eralization rules in ETOC \[8\], and the other is Naka- 
nmra's method using content words \[5\]. They are 
the word-based  best  match  re t r ieva l  methods 1, 
which need morphological analysis. 
This paper proposes the character -based  best  
match  re t r ieva l  method,  specifically for Japanese 
texts  Compared with the word-hased methods, the 
charaeter-h~sed method has the following advantages: 
? Morphological analysis is unnecessary. 
? Some kind of synonyms can he retrieved without 
a thesallrlls. 
This method has been implemented in CTM ~, a 
Japanese-English translation aid system for writ- 
ing/translating technical papers.

2 The  Character -Based  Best  
Match  Ret r ieva l  Method  
2.1 Character i s t i cs  o f  Japanese  Wr i t -  
ten  Texts  
Japanese written texts have remarkable characteris- 
tics as follows. 'riley cannot he found in European 
languages, i.e., English, French, and German. 
1. The number of characters is very large. 
The numher of characters that are used ill text is 
more than 7,000 in Japanese. while it is less than a 
hundred in a European language. 
2. Synouyms often have the same Kanji character. 
Japanese characters are divided into three types'. Hi- 
ragana (83 characters), Katakana (86 characters), 
and Kanji. A lt iragana or Katakana character ex- 
presses a sound,  and a Kanji character epresents a 
semantic primitive. For example, tile Kanji character 
"~"  means "thinking", and it is used for construct- 
lug several words concerned with thinking: e.g., ,~( 
~(thinking)~ ",~, (consideration), ~,~'(deep think- 
ing), ~~Ta (think), ~\ [~TTa  (devise). 
3. There is no delimiter between words. 
In l"uropean languages, the white space is the delim- 
iter for word separation. In contrast, Japanese has 
no explicit delimiter. Therefore, the main part of 
Japanese morphological analysis is to divide a text 
string into words: it is not easy task a. 
These characteristics of Japanese suggest the 
character -based  best  l l late| l ,  becanse 
I While the word-based method needs morphologi- 
cal analysis, the character-bmsed method does not 
need it. 
2. In order to retrieve synonyms the word-based 
method needs a thesaurus. In coutra.st, the 
character-based method call retrieve some kind of 
synonyms withont a thesallrus, because synonynls 
often have tile same Kanji character in Japanese. 
2.2 The Character-Based Best Match 
The character-based best match can be determined 
by defining the distance or similarity measure be- 
tween two strings. 
The simple measure of similarity hetween two 
strings, A = alau...a~., H = btb2. . .by,  is the num- 
ber of the matching characters considering the char- 
acter order constraint. It is not particularly good 
aFor  example ,  a Jap&llese morphoh~gical  anMyMs pFOgl'&lll 
developed by Nyolt~ University fails to anMyze 3 ~ ,5 % of 
Selll ellCeS. 
memsure, bat makes a convenient starting point. We 
define it as follows: 
s( i , j )  = 
0 i f i=ov j=o 
s ( i -  l , j  l )+m( i , j ) ,  ) 
max s(i l , j ) ,  
s ( i , j  1) 
i f ( l  _< i < x) A(1 <_j<y)  
1 if a~ = b 3 
m{i , j )  = 0 i fa ,~b j  
This measure often produces the undesirable re- 
suits, because we ignore continuation of matching 
characters. For example, consider the following 
strings: 
A = I" I~R4~'?70 (solve the problem) 
f~ = t~a~ m 5 ,~ j~1ce~ Ltco 
(He solved the problem yesterday.) 
(determine tile method for solving the problem) 
We want to be S(A,13) > ,9(A, F?'), but the above 
measure produces ,5'(A, B) < ,S'(A, B~). To solve the 
problem, we consider tile bonus for contimmns match- 
ing characters. It can be done by modifying m( i , j )  
m the the above definition: 
,5'(A,,~) = s(x,:j) 
s( i , j )  = 
.s(i -- 1, j  1) + min(cm( i , j ) ,W)  
max s( i -  l , j ) ,  
s( i , j  - 1) 
if(l < i< ~)A(1 _<j _< y) 
~,,~(/, j) = 
0 i f i=OVj=O 
em(i  l , j  - 1) + m(i , j )  
if(1 _< i _< x)^(~ _<j <:/) 
1 if ai = bj 
m(i , j )  = 0 i fa i~b j  
This is the similarity score that we use, where W is a 
parameter that determines the max imum value of the 
bonus for tile continuons matching characters. When 
14" = 1, this definition is the same with tile previous 
definition. Table l shows ,5'(A, B) and S(A, B') with 
varying vahws of W. l_lsually we use W = 4. 4

2.3 Accelerat ion by Character  Index 
At the be'st n/arch retrieval, we use the acceleration 
method using the character index. '~ The character 
index is tile tahle of every character with ll)'s of ex- 
amples in which the character is appeared. Table 2 
shows all exatnple of translation database and Table 3 
shows the character index of it. 
In the first stage of the retrieval, the character in- 
dex is used for the pre-seleetion of tile examples. Fig- 
ore 2 illustrates the pre-selection process: it is 
1. Look up the records for the characters that are 
appeared in the input string. 
2. For e'very examph,, compute the pre-selection 
score, I ' SS ,  wtfich can he ohtained by counting 
tile nurnher of the example l l) 's in the records. It 
is the number of matching characters between the 
input string and tilt! example ignoring the charac- 
ter order constraint. 
3. Select tile top N examples that have tile largest 
pre-selection score, where N is the parameter and 
we usually use N = 200. s 
In the second stage of the retrieval, the similarity 
scores of life-selected examples arc eomptlte(I, and the 
examples are ordered by the score.

the first retrieval example is the literal meaning, and 
the second is the idiomatic meaning.

It is very difficult to evaluate a translation aid sys- 
tem, because its effectiveness essentially depends on 
the user's satisfaction: when the user feels that the 
system is helpfld, it is effective. The evaluation of 
CTM is now in progress, an<l we show some results of 
experiments here. 
The  Ret r ieva l  T ime 
F, mpirieally, we ohtaim'd the following equation, 
which est imates the retriewd time (millisecond). 
t ime( I ,k ,N)  = I x (D0 x k+2/3  x N)  
where I is tile length of tile input str ing, k (mega 
byte) is the database size, and N is tile we-selection 
parameter.  For e?ample, i f /=  D0 (characters),  k = 8 
(mega byte), N = 200, then t ime = 2,133 (millisec- 
ond). It shows that tile current systeln responses ill 
a few seconds and it is not so fi~st. The more accel-
