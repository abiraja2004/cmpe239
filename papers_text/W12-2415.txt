Abstract
The goal of this work is to apply NLP tech-
niques to the field of BioNLP in order to gain
a better insight into the field and show connec-
tions and trends that might not otherwise be
apparent. The data we analyzed was the pro-
ceedings from last decade of BioNLP work-
shops. Our findings reveal the prominent re-
search problems and techniques in the field,
their progression over time, the approaches
that researchers are using to solve those prob-
lems, insightful ways to categorize works in
the field, and the prominent researchers and
groups whose works are influencing the field.
1 Introduction
Thanks to improving technology and the discovery
of stronger statistical methods, natural language pro-
cessing techniques have more power than ever to
give us insights into real datasets too large for hu-
mans to efficiently process. In the field of BioNLP,
we see that natural language processing has a wide
range of applications within the medical domain
from analysis of clinical data to literature. With
the increasing amount of publications in this grow-
ing field, building a classification structure is help-
ful both for categorizing papers in a sensible way
and for recognizing the trends that brought the field
to where it is today. Understanding the current na-
ture of the field can show us where the most effort
is needed, while taking a look at where the field has
been can highlight successes and even unanswered
questions.
As the use of NLP in the medical domain has ex-
panded in recent years so has the amount of freely-
available online research. With this wealth of infor-
mation comes a problem, however, as it is not truly
feasible for humans to read through all the research
out there and classify it in a way that will capture the
less-obvious trends and the finer relationships be-
tween seemingly-disconnected works. Instead, we
propose that statistical methods can help us discover
both the most reasonable way to partition the field
and also see how the research has changed over the
past decade. The longer term goal for the work is to
contribute to a ?map? of the field that can be a com-
munity resource, such as www.medlingmap.org, de-
scribed in Meteer, et al (2012).
Schuemie et al (2009) used clustering techniques
to analyze the domain of Medical Informatics. They
processed a large number of Medline abstracts to
find a subset of the journals classified as ?Medical
Informatics? whose content was sufficiently related
to constitute a basis for the field. Using hierarchi-
cal clustering, they determined that such a group of
journals exists and, as we might expect, the rest of
the journals were largely disconnected. They also
used this cluster of journals as the basis for a topic
modeling task. Analyzing the articles from their new
basis of journals, they found three very strong, topic-
based clusters, each comprised of three sub-clusters.
Overall, Schuemie et al (2009) demonstrated how it
is possible to gain a great deal of insight into the na-
ture of a field by using statistical methods over that
field?s literature. More recently, Gupta and Manning
(2011) used automatic methods to tag documents for
?focus,? ?technique,? and ?domain? by examining
122
over 15,000 ACL abstracts. This level of categoriza-
tion is useful because it expands beyond the simple
notion of the ?topic? to implicitly show if a work,
for example, is about an application of named-entity
recognition or if it simply uses NER to achieve a
greater task. The techniques demonstrated by Gupta
and Manning could be very enlightening if applied
to the BioNLP proceedings, though in this paper we
refrain from drawing conclusions about individual
papers. Instead, we will relate them through the top-
ics extracted from the full-text proceedings.
For our task, we look to the ACL and NAACL-
associated workshops on NLP applications in the
medical domain. Entering its 11th year, the BioNLP
workshop (under a variety of names) has given
us ten rich and varied proceedings in addition to
a pair of more focused shared tasks. All in all,
the workshops have produced over 270 unique pa-
pers. Our data of 270 documents was small relative
to (Schuemie et al, 2009) 6.3 million documents;
therefore, we chose to expand our analysis to the
full text of the documents instead of just the ab-
stracts. Additionally, using the full papers allowed
us to capture information about document content
that abstracts alone could not provide.
2 Methods and Results
2.1 Pipeline Architecture
We implemented a document processing pipeline
that would allow our approaches to be generaliz-
able, easily reproducible, and extendable. Each
of our analytic processes was integrated into this
pipeline and parameterized to allow us proper flex-
ibility for empirical experimentation. The pipeline
works by managing the interaction between a con-
figurable set of data layers and a configurable set
of processing stages over those layers. It supports
saving and loading its internal state between stages.
In addition, layers and stages follow specific tem-
plates that reduce the amount of code to write and
maintain. The ordering and activation of each stage
is also parameterized. This pipeline allowed us to
quickly and efficiently experiment with various ap-
proaches and combine them. The sample imple-
mentation of this pipeline is available publicly at
github.com/attapol/mapping bionlp.

2.2 Preprocessing
The papers from the BioNLP workshop are all avail-
able freely from the ACL Anthology Archive 1. We
first extracted the text from the PDF files using
pdf2text unix tool and then tagged them all for title,
authors, places of origin, abstract, content, and ref-
erences. In all cases, the abstract, content, and refer-
ences were separated automatically using a script,
and the places had to be hand-annotated. Papers
from 2004 onward (starting with the first BioLINK
workshop) have complete BibTeX entries that al-
lowed us to automatically extract the titles and au-
thors, but for 2002 and 2003 this work had to be
done manually. Since we wanted to perform our
analysis solely on the prose of the papers, and not on
any of the numerical data, we filtered out portions of
the text containing elements such as tables, graphs,
footnotes, and URLs. We also filtered out stopwords
(as defined by the NLTK package (Bird and Loper,
2004) for Python).

2.3 Topic Modeling
Using the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002), we were
able to generate topics from our cleaned data using
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. This
approach allows us to represent each document as a
vector of topic proportions instead of a bag of words,
which prevents the problem of sparsity. When we
set the number of topics to 30, the system output a
set of distinct topics that seem to describe a range
of tasks and methods within the domain of BioNLP.
The topics generated by the LDA model reflect areas
of study that are being pursued, techniques that are
being applied, and resources that are being consulted
in the field. A list of the generated topics along with
the associated keywords is shown in Table 1 and the
distributions of the topics across the entire document
set is displayed in Figure 1.
Additionally, we found that the topics generated
by LDA were more informative about the full con-
tent of a work than those generated by TF-IDF as
TF-IDF would often give too much weight to spe-
cific examples over general concepts. For exam-
ple, TF-IDF tended to select specific names of re-
sources and ontologies rather than general terms.
For example, it selected ?Frame-net? instead ?ontol-
ogy? and ?RadLex? instead of ?lexicon?. We con-
cluded that, while interesting, TF-IDF results were
not strongly suited for capturing an overall glimpse
of the field. However, we think that TF-IDF can be
much more useful in its more traditional capacity of
finding document-specific keywords; we aim to use
these indices to partially automate keyword genera-
tion for MedlingMap (Meteer et al, 2012), which is
our accompanying project.
2.4 Topic Correlation
While looking at the topic proportions for each of
our LDA topics overall can help us paint a broad
picture of the field, it can also help to look at the
relationship between these topics as they occur in
the documents. Some topics appear highly ranked
in nearly all papers, such as the topic that is char-
acterized by terms such as ?system? and ?results?,
and the topic that includes ?precision? and ?recall?
because they reflect the performance evaluation con-
vention in the field. However, most topics are only
dominant in a small subset of the papers. Some

occurrences between the event extraction topic and some
of the method-related topics.
topics refer to tasks (e.g. named-entity recognition,
hedging) and others refer to techniques (e.g. CRFs,
parsing). We can look at how often pairs of task-
related topic and method-related topic co-occur to
see if researchers in the community are using certain
techniques in conjunction with solving certain prob-
lems. We first turned a topic proportion vector into a
binary vector where each element indicates which
topic is discussed more extensively than average.
Then, we counted the co-occurrences of tasks and
methods of interest. To demonstrate this, we com-
puted the number of papers that substantially discuss
event extraction in conjunction with parsing, graph,
lexical categories, or semantic knowledge (Figure
2). This topic comparison method provides a means
of visualizing how researchers in the field are ap-
proaching BioNLP problems. It reveals that parsing
and graph-based methods are commonly used in bio-
logical event extraction, while lexical categories and
semantic knowledge are not as central to many of the
approaches to this task. Moving forward, tracking
how these correlations change over time will pro-
vide an insightful reflection of the field?s progress
on the task in a more meaningful way than evalu-
ation scores alone. While a deeper analysis of all
of such trends is beyond the scope of this paper, it
certainly warrants further investigation.

2.5 Trends within the subdisciplines in
Biomedical NLP Literature
Our analysis of temporal trends builds on the idea
proposed by (Hall et al, 2008) in their analysis of
the changing trends in the field of computational lin-
guistics over time. In their approach, they attempted,
among other things, to analyze which topics were up
and coming in the field and which were becoming
less popular. Given their sound results, we decided
to perform the same kind of trend analysis over the
BioNLP topics. For many of our 30 topics, there
was little change in the topic frequency over time.
Considering the relative youth of the BioNLP field,
this result is not entirely surprising. We did, how-
ever, find a few topics that have undergone notable
changes in these past ten years, as observable in Fig-
ure 3. In particular, we found that two topics have
seen surges of activity in recent years, whereas there
were three topics that started out strong in the early
years but that have since petered off. The two top-
ics that have gained popularity in the past few years
both involve biomedical events. Specifically, one
such topic is primarily about event extraction tasks,
and the other is about event triggers and the more
fine-grained roles one needs to tag to categorize such
events. The popularity of these two tasks is hardly
surprising, given that they were the focus of the 2009
and 2011 shared tasks which were about working
with events in both general and detailed ways. We
do notice, however, that the growing trends continue
in 2010 as well, when there was no shared task, and
so we can see that events are of great interest in
the field at present even without the added incen-
tive of the shared tasks. It is reasonable to suggest
that the 2009 BioNLP Shared Task in event extrac-
tion generated interest in the topic that continued
through 2010 and 2011. Two more topics originally
saw their popularity rise in the early years, but have

since seen it fade. Each of these is a specific task:
named-entity recognition, which dropped off after
2004, and protein interaction, which saw a sharp de-
cline after 2005. Although a detailed causal analysis
is beyond the scope of this paper, we might wonder
what accounts for these drops in topic proportion.
The explanation that seems most likely is that great
strides were made in these areas early on, but we
have since reached a plateau in advancements. As
such, the research has moved elsewhere. The only
topic to see a steady decrease from the start was the
topic associated with the Unified Medical Language
System. In general, we can view a trend associated
with a resource differently from one associated with
a task. Above, when discussing tasks, we saw where
the research currently has been heading and where it
has been. With a resource, we could consider an up-
ward trend to represent either an increased number
of applications to a task or perhaps an expansion of
the resource itself. In the case of UMLS, the down-
ward trend likely suggests that the field has moved
away from this particular resource, either because it
does not apply as well to newer tasks or because it
has been replaced with something more powerful.
2.6 Cluster Analysis
Our next step with the LDA-generated topics was
to run a k-means clustering algorithm. We used the
same topic proportion vector and a Euclidean met-
ric to create the feature space for clustering. We
used the standard k-means function in the statisti-
cal language R (R Development Core Team, 2010).
The assumption of the LDA model biases each topic
proportion vector to be sparse (Blei et al, 2003), and
this turns out to be true in our data set. Therefore, we
chose the number of clusters to match the number of
topics so that the document space can be partitioned
proportionally to its dimensionality. This clustering
provides us with a useful schema for document clas-
sification within the domain of BioNLP. We can use
the clusters as a guide for how to organize the cur-
rent papers, and we can also view the clusters as a
guide for how to select relevant research to build fu-
ture work on. Clusters bring together related papers
from different research groups and multiple work-
shops, such as those shown in Table 2. In all of these
examples, the selection of these sets of papers sim-
ply based on keyword search would be very difficult,
since many of the key terms are going to be present
in a much larger set of documents.
2.7 Author Relation Analysis
As an additional task, we investigated the connec-
tions between authors in the BioNLP proceedings.
Eggers et al (2005) used a graph to visualize who
was being cited by whom in ISI publications. There,
the hope was to identify which authors worked
within the same subdisciplines by examining clus-
ters within the citation graph. By examining who
cited whom in the BioNLP publications, we hoped
instead to uncover the authors of the most influen-
tial papers, both within our own clusters and outside
the scope of the BioNLP workshops. In our model,
which can be viewed in Figure 4, we constructed a

directed graph of author citations from the BioNLP
workshops and shared tasks. We disregarded the au-
thor ordering within each paper and gave the same
weights for all authors whose names appear on the
paper. In this graph, a node points to another node if
that author cited the other author at least three times.
Additionally, a white node signifies an author who
published in the BioNLP workshop between 2008
and 2011, whereas a grey node is someone who did
not, but was cited in papers during that time span. As
can be seen in Figure 4 above, which is itself only
a piece of the complete graph, this graph is rather
large and complex, showing us a large degree of in-
terconnectedness and interdependence in the field.
Simply from the density of the lines, we can find
some of the most influential figures, such as Jun?ichi
Tsujii, shown in Region 3 and Yoshimasa Tsuruoka,
shown in Region 2. Unsurprisingly, Tsujii?s node is
bustling with activity, as a very large number of au-
thors cite works with Tsujii as an author, and his own
prolific authorship (or co-authorship) naturally has
him citing a variety of authors. The white nodes near
his own show the authors who published BioNLP
papers and primarily referenced his works, whereas
the grey nodes near his show people who didn?t pub-
lish, but who Tsujii cited in the proceedings multiple
127
times. Thus, proximity can also be very telling in a
graph like this. Since nodes with a heavier reliance
on one another tend to end up closer to one another,
we can also observe something of a ?citation hierar-
chy? in sections of the graph. Region 2 is a prime
example of this notion. We observe Ananiadou at
the bottom with a large number of incoming edges.
Above her node, we see Korhonen, who cites Ana-
niadou but is also cited by a number of other authors
herself. Finally, above Korhonen there are a series
of single nodes who cite her (and Ananiadou) but are
without incoming edges of their own. We can think
of this as something of a ?local hierarchy?, consist-
ing of authors who are closely connected, with the
more heavily-cited (and heavily-citing) easy to pick
out.
3 Next Steps
The work described here provides a snapshot into
the field. Underlying the work is a toolset able to
reproduce the results on new sets of data to continue
tracking the trends, topics, and collaborations. How-
ever, to be really useful to the research community,
the results need to be captured in a way that can fa-
cilitate searches in this domain and support ongoing
research. In order to do this, we are in the process of
incorporating the results presented here in a content
management system, MedLingMap (Meteer et al,
2012), which supports faceted indexing. Research
in search interface design has shown that techniques
which can create hierarchical faceted metadata stuc-
tures of a domain significantly increase the ability of
users to efficiently access documents in the collec-
tion (Stoica et al, 2005). The techniques described
here can be fed into MedLingMap to create much
of the metadata required to efficiently navigate the
space.
4 Conclusion
In this report, we have outlined a variety of meth-
ods that can be used to gain a better understand-
ing of BioNLP as a field. Our use of topic model-
ing demonstrates that the field already has several
well-defined tasks, techniques, and resources, and
we showed that we can use these topics to gain in-
sight into the major research areas in the field and
how those efforts areas are progressing. We put forth
that this analysis could be powerful in recogniz-
ing when a problem has been effectively ?solved?,
when a technique falls out of favor, and when a re-
source grows outdated. At the same time, we can
see rising trends, such as how the 2009 shared task
spurred an obvious 2010 interest in event extraction,
and the correlations in the field between certain ap-
proaches and certain tasks. Through clustering, we
were able to show that these topics also can help us
separate the documents from the field into distinc-
tive groups with a common theme, which can aid in
building a database for current documents and clas-
sifying future ones. Finally, we ended with an anal-
ysis of author relations based on citation frequency
and demonstrated how such a structure can be useful
in identifying influential figures through their works.
As a further benefit of this work, we propose to
use it to create a more lasting resource for the com-
munity that makes these results available to support
search and and navigation in the bio-medical NLP
field.
