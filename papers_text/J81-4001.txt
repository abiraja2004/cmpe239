Recent studies in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have demonstrated the need 
for a theory of the comprehension of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for the 
role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as inferential knowledge in explaining how 
anaphors are understood. In this paper a new approach, based on a theory of the process 
of focusing on parts of the discourse, is used to explain the interpretation of anaphors. 
The concept of a speaker's loci is defined, and their use is demonstrated in choosing the 
interpretations of personal pronouns. The rules for choosing interpretations are stated 
within a framework that shows: how to control search in inferring by a new method called 
constraint checking; how to take advantage of syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints 
on interpretation; and how to generalize the treatment of personal pronouns, to serve as a 
framework for the theory of interpretation for all anaphors. 
1. Introduction 
Traditionally researchers have defined the problem 
of comprehending anaphoric expressions as one of 
determining the antecedent of an anaphoric expression, 
that is, determining to which word or phrase an ana- 
phoric expression refers or "points".  Recent studies 
in both artificial intelligence and linguistics have dem- 
onstrated the need for a theory of the comprehension 
of anaphoric expressions, a theory that accounts for 
the role of syntactic and semantic effects, as well as 
inferential knowledge in explaining how anaphors are 
understood. In this paper a new theory, based on the 
concept of focusing in the discourse, is introduced to 
explain the interpretation of pronouns. 
Before a theory can be given, and before even the 
difficulties in interpreting anaphors 2 can be discussed,

2 I use the term "anaphor"  for an anaphoric expression, and I 
use "anaphora"  in its traditional meaning, that is, as the device of 
using a word or phrase "to point back." 
we must first re-consider what an antecedent is. The 
traditional definition encounters difficulty right from 
the start; it is founded on the notion that one word in 
a sentence refers or points back to another word or 
phrase in the (same or another) sentence. But words 
don't  refer back to other words \[Morgan 1978\]; people 
use words to refer to entities in the world. In particu- 
lar they use pronouns to refer to entities which have 
already been mentioned in a discourse. Since an ana- 
phoric phrase does not refer to an antecedent, one 
might want to claim that both the antecedent and the 
anaphor co-refer to the same entity. That description 
is adequate for sentence s l ,  
sl  I think green apples taste best and they 
make the best cooking apples too. 
though not for discourse D1, where there is no ante- 
cedent phrase in the discourse that co-refers with the 
pronoun "they."  
DI -1  My neighbor has a monster Harley 1200. 
2 They are really huge but gas-efficient 
bikes. 
Rather than view antecedence as co-reference, one 
might propose that antecedence is a kind of cognitive 
pointing, the kind of pointing that causes " they"  and 
"green apples" to point (somehow) to the same class 
of entities in one's mind. This proposal is problematic 
for the same reason that co-reference is: people use 
pronouns when there is no other noun phrase in the

discourse that points to the right mental entity. In D1, 
" they"  refers to bikes which are Harley 1200's as a 
group, while "a monster Harley 1200" mentions only 
some particular Harley 1200. "They"  seems to be 
able to refer when used with the previously mentioned 
phrase "a monster Harley 1200" without the two 
phrases either co-referring or co-pointing. 
If an anaphor does not refer to an antecedent 
phrase, and if it need not always co-refer with its ap- 
parent antecedent (as in D1), then anaphor interpreta- 
tion is not simply finding the antecedent. Nevertheless 
the concept of antecedence as pointing back does 
seem to capture some aspect of the comprehension of 
anaphors, for when certain antecedent words are miss- 
ing from a discourse, people often fail to understand 
what is being said. 
Let us define the problem of interpreting and un- 
derstanding an anaphor in the following way. The 
phrase "green apples" in s l ,  when syntactically and 
semantically interpreted, is said to specify a cognitive 
element in the hearer's mind. In the computational 
model of that process, this element is a database item, 
which might be represented by Apples2 in by the sche- 
ma below: 
Phrase76: 
string: "green apples" 
context: speakerl  think * tastes best 
specifies: Apples2 
Apples2: 
super-concept: apples 
color: green 
used-for: cooking 
The speaker uses the information in a cognitive repre- 
sentation like Apples2 above to choose the phrase 
"green apples" in sl .  The hearer then uses the phrase 
"green apples" plus the syntactic and semantic inter- 
pretation of the rest of the sentence to locate a similar 
cognitive element in his own mind; it may be slightly 
different because the hearer may not associate use in 
cooking with green apples. A cognitive element, such 
as Apples2, is called the specification of "green ap- 
ples." These elements, present in the memories of 
speaker and hearer, are of course related to other cog- 
nitive elements in their memories. 
What is the relation of specifications to the real 
world? One might like to claim that a reference rela- 
tion exists between specified cognitive elements and 
objects in the world, but since referring is what people 
do with words, this relation is problematic for cogni- 
tive elements. Instead, specifications are said to 
represent the objects referred to; that is, they bear a 
well-structured correspondence to objects in the world. 
Apples2, the specification of "green apples," repre- 
sents the objects that are green apples. For phrases 
such as "Santa Claus," where there is no real world 
object to represent, a specification represents the men- 
tal schema to which are attached the properties nor- 
mally associated with this imaginary person. 
The phrase " they"  in sl also specifies a cognitive 
element, namely the same one that "green apples" 
does. Since the two bear the same relation to the 
representation Apples2, I say that they "co-speci fy"  
that memory element, or alternatively, that the inter- 
pretation of "green apples" is the co-specifier of the 
interpretation of " they."  Co-specif ication, unlike 
co-reference, allows one to construct abstract repre- 
sentations and define relationships between them 
which can be studied in a computational framework. 
With co-reference no such use is possible, since the 
object referred to exists in the world and is not availa- 
ble for examination by computational processes. 
Even if a phrase and a pronoun do not co-specify, 
the specification of the phrase may be used to generate 
the specification of a pronoun. For example, in D1 
" they"  does not co-specify with the apparent anteced- 
ent phrase "a monster Harley 1200," but rather it 
refers to the class of Harley 1200's of which the ap- 
parent antecedent is an instance. Thus anaphor inter- 
pretation is not simply a matter of finding the corre- 
sponding cognitive element that serves as the specifi- 
cation of the anaphor; some additional process must 
generate a specification for the anaphor from the rela- 
ted phrase "a monster Harley 1200." 
The concepts of specification and co-specification 
capture the "point ing back"  quality of antecedence, 
and also permit us to formulate an explanation of ana- 
phor interpretation that avoids the pitfalls of the con- 
cept of antecedence. Anaphor interpretation can be 
studied as a computational process that uses the al- 
ready existing specification of a phrase to find the 
specification for an anaphor. The process uses a rep- 
resentation of the discourse preceding the anaphor to 
encode the syntactic and semantic relationships in each 
sentence as well as co-specification relationships be- 
tween phrases. 3 These definitions in themselves do 
not constitute a theory of anaphor interpretation. 
They do, however, make possible a succinct statement 
of the problem: how does one determine the specifi- 
cation of a anaphor? Also, since we suspect that the 
specification of an apparent antecedent phrase plays 
some role in choosing an anaphor's specification, we 
may ask, just what is this role? We hope for a direct 
answer to these questions, but before one can be giv- 
en, let us consider how a theory of interpretation 
ought to address these questions. A brief look at the 
3 In the rest of this paper, I speak of a phrase co-specifying 
(or specifying) with another phrase, when what I really mean is that 
the relation is between representations of phrases that have been 
interpreted by some parsing process, which indicates the sentence 
syntactic relations, and by a semantic interpretation process, which 
computes emantic relations among words of the sentence.

difficulties of choosing co-specifiers suggests which 
issues our theory should cover. 
Determining the co-specifier of an anaphor is diffi- 
cult because there are a multitude of possible co- 
specifiers in a given discourse, and there is no simple 
way to choose the correct one. Yet human hearers 
and readers generally do recover the correct co- 
specifying phrase intended by the speaker. Human 
readers and hearers also fail to recover the co- 
specifying phrase in certain situations; this behavior is 
just as valuable an observation as garden path phe- 
nomena for theories of parsing. A theory of interpre- 
tation must predict the pattern of the hearer 's and 
reader's correct and incorrect choices, as well as fail- 
ures to understand, by a rule-governed account. In 
addition, a taxonomy of the cases in which specifica- 
tions are used to generate other specifications must be 
given, as well as a means of predicting their distribu- 
tion. 
Two other aspects of communication make it diffi- 
cult to find co-specifiers: the context of discussion and 
the inferences people make. People use the context 
surrounding an anaphor in understanding it. If a theo- 
ry of anaphor interpretation is to capture understand- 
ing, it must include a means of encoding discourse 
context and whatever structure it has; the context 
must be distilled into a form that preserves its richness 
without adding overwhelming complexity to the inter- 
pretation process. In addition, researchers have dis- 
covered that anaphor interpretation involves making 
inferences, some of which can be complex, each of 
which must be chosen from a large base of knowledge 
about objects, people and things. The practical de- 
ployment of inferential capabilities for any task re- 
quires control: knowing what to infer when, and 
knowing when to stop. Since the general control 
problem is poorly understood, a theory of anaphor 
interpretation must provide solutions to the more spe- 
cific problem of controlling inference in anaphor inter- 
pretation. 
The major portion of this paper addresses the is- 
sues of determining the specifications of anaphors, 
with an emphasis on the role of context and inference. 
The theory of focusing on parts of the discourse is 
introduced, and a processor and its rules which rely on 
the focusing theory are discussed. Before turning to 
this discussion, the previous and extensive research on 
anaphora re reviewed. 
2. Research on Anaphora 
The role of context and inference, as well as syntax 
and semantics, on anaphor interpretation have been 
explored extensively. A brief look at these explora- 
tions indicates the necessity of a new approach. Re- 
search on anaphora falls into four broad categories: 
1. General heuristics for finding antecedents 
\[Winograd 1972\] 
2. Syntactic and semantic onstraints on anaphora 
\[Katz & Fodor 1963, Woods et al 1976, Chomsky 
1976, Lasnik 1976, Reinhart 1976, Walker 1976\] 
3. Use of inference to find antecedents \[Charniak 
1972, Rieger 1974, Hobbs 1976\] 
4. Analysis of relations among objects in a discourse 
context \[Grosz 1977, Lockman 1978, Reichman 
1978, Webber 1978, Hobbs 1979\] 
Rather than review each approach, I point out the 
contributions of each type to a theory of pronoun 
interpretation. 
General heuristics, as a means of choosing anteced- 
ents, predict reliably in a large number of typical ex- 
amples. However,  no simple characterization fits the 
wide variety of cases where they fail (see Winograd 
1972 and Hobbs 1977); furthermore, the heuristic 
approach is not theoretically grounded and cannot 
offer a unified approach to the phenomena. 
Semantic selectional restrictions, based on the Katz- 
Fodor theory of semantic markers, and used by many 
computational linguists, can reduce the space of possi- 
ble antecedents, but they cannot be used to eliminate 
all possibilities, as the example below illustrates 
(where feeling soft can be said of either a mud pack or 
one's face): 
s2 Put the mud pack on your face. Notice 
how soft it feels. 
Syntactic restrictions, on logical form \[Chomsky 1976\] 
and on constituent structure \[Lasnik 1976, Reinhart 
1976\], stipulate conditions in which a pronoun and a 
noun phrase must have disjoint reference, as shown 
below. 
s3 * Near Dan, he saw a snake. 
s4 * The man whose house he bought went 
gold digging in Alaska. 
These rules, however, do not stipulate the interpreta- 
tion of a pronoun; in a general theory they serve only 
as a filtering condition on the class of possible co- 
specifications. Furthermore,  syntactic restrictions 
must also stipulate the disjoint reference conditions on 
reflexive pronouns although no adequate account of 
these conditions has yet appeared. 
Work by researchers in artificial intelligence on 
inference led to methods for forward and backward 
chaining of inferences to bind the pronoun, represent- 
ed as a free variable, with some piece of knowledge; 
with this approach, the pronoun's interpretation was 
the value bound to the free variable. This approach 
revealed that inferences about world knowledge are 
often needed to interpret pronouns. However,  these 
methods failed to control the inference process suffi- 
ciently. Charniak, attempting to resolve this problem,

proposed demons that would "wake up" in the appro- 
priate situation (that is, processes which could them- 
selves notice when they were to begin processing). 
But a large cache of demons would be required, and 
no assurance could be given that demons would exist 
in every situation. Most significantly, this proposal 
said nothing about the situation where two or more 
demons might apply (who gets control? how are the 
decisions made?). Furthermore all of the inference- 
based approaches to pronoun interpretation fail to 
offer any theoretical approach because they rely on a 
simple mechanism, (simple variable binding between 
pronoun and some other phrase) which does not apply 
in many uses of anaphors, such as D1. 
Discourse approaches to anaphora include a techni- 
que similar to the inference method; one identifies 
sentence pairs and determines their semantic relation- 
ship as one of elaboration, similarity, contrast, parallel 
structure; the pronouns are interpreted by variable 
binding between items of the sentence pairs \[Hobbs 
1979\]. Webber 1978, using a notion of "discourse 
identif ications" (that contain certain semantic and 
discourse content) similar to the notion of specifica- 
tion, stipulates constraints on the representation of 
relations among items mentioned in a discourse. 
Grosz \[1977, 1978, 1981\] illustrates how parts of a 
speaker's knowledge, relevant to a discourse segment, 
are highlighted via focusing, a process that reflects 
what a speaker says and the nature of the knowledge 
in the space. She shows that the structure of a task 
affects what items will be focused on in the discourse. 
Reichman has expanded this paradigm by describing 
context spaces, delineated by their topics. Her analysis 
shows that within a context space only certain items 
may be pronominalized. She leaves open the ques- 
tions: What is the recognition procedure for determin- 
ing a context space? How does one identify its topic? 
How does the hearer determine the interpretation of a 
pronoun, i.e., how does a hearer decide which highly 
focused items act as the co-specification of a pronoun? 
All these approaches upport the view that since hear- 
ers do not have privileged access to a speaker's mind, 
other than through what a speaker says, imposing 
structure on the speaker's discourse will provide a 
framework for establishing the interpretation of pro- 
nouns. 
The remainder of this paper defines the concept of 
speaker's foci and shows that they can be used to 
choose specifications for personal pronouns. The rules 
for choosing interpretations are stated within a frame- 
work that shows: 
? how to control search in inferring by a new me- 
thod called constraint checking, 
? how to take advantage of syntactic, semantic 
and discourse constraints on interpretation, 
how to generalize the treatment of personal 
pronouns, to serve as a framework for the theo- 
ry of interpretation for all anaphors. 
3. Focus for Pronoun Interpretat ion 
A simple discourse can be used to illustrate how 
pronouns indicate what the speaker is talking about in 
the discourse. In the sample below, the speaker men- 
tions two dogs and tells us something about each. 
D2-1 I have two dogs. 
2 (The) one is a poodle; 
3 the other is a cocker spaniel. 
4 The poodle has some weird habits. 
5 He eats plastic flowers and likes to sleep 
in a paper bag. 
6 It 's a real problem keeping him away from 
plastic flowers. 
7 The cocker is pretty normal, 
8 and he's a good watch dog. 
9 I like having them as pets. 
The speaker uses the pronouns "he"  and "h im"  to 
indicate that the poodle is the actor of eating flowers 
and the object of an action of keeping. The speaker 
mentions his second dog with "the other"  and then 
uses the pronoun "he"  only in predicate adjective and 
predicate nominative constructions without reference 
to any events. Initially the speaker focuses attention 
on both dogs and then turns his attention to each for a 
part of the discourse. The process by which the 
speaker uses language to indicate his focus is called 
the focusing process. The items in focus are those that 
are talked about for a part of the discourse. Items in 
focus can be used in two ways, as actor focus and as 
discourse focus. The actor focus is a discourse item 
that is predicated as the agent in some event, so for 
example, the poodle is the agent in eating flowers, 
while the discourse focus is, roughly speaking, an item 
the speaker wishes to make several predications 
about. 4
The focusing process, when explained from the 
viewpoint of a hearer, can be described as a process of 
tracking the speaker's loci as they change over the 
discourse. A hearer does not have privileged informa- 
tion about what is in a particular speaker's head, so 
the hearer must decide what the speaker is talking 
about on the basis of what the speaker uses as initial 
referring expressions and subsequent co-specifying 
anaphoric expressions. The hearer follows a focus and 
checks to see if the anaphoric expressions which the 
speaker uses either co-specify with the hearer's repre- 
sentation of that focus or specify a representat ion 
4 This description is not a definition of discourse focus. The 
discourse focus is defined by the effects of several focusing algor- 
ithms; for details, see Sidner 1979.

related to it. The hearer is said to be tracking the 
speaker's focus because she or he can determine what 
is being talked about only after the speaker has said 
something. Focus, as it is used here, is akin to Grosz's 
notion \[1977\] of immediate focus. 
A process model of focusing and focus tracking 
consists of three distinct processors. The first chooses 
foci based on what the speaker initially says. The 
algorithm for this choice depends on many phenomena 
- see Sidner 1979 for details. Then an interpreter (the 
pronoun interpreter) uses these foci and a set of rules 
of pronoun interpretation (hereafter "pi -rules")  to 
interpret the anaphoric expressions in the discourse. 
This interpreter, like a human hearer, must keep in 
mind whatever other newly mentioned elements the 
speaker has introduced, since sometimes an anaphor 
may co-specify with one of those instead of the ele- 
ments in focus. A third process updates the loci by 
decisions that depend on anaphoric interpretations 
chosen by the pronoun interpreter. During this last 
phase, the updating process moves one of the loci to a 
new element of the discourse, if some anaphor co- 
specified with that new element while no anaphor 
co-specif ied with the phrase already in focus. The 
three processes taken together sketch a simple model 
of focus tracking; the model appears to behave like its 
human counterpart in the way it interprets anaphors 
and in the instances in 
So far, the process 
chosen, they are used 
which it fails to "understand." 
model looks circular. Foci are 
to determine how anaphors co- 
specify with the loci and then the co-specifiers are 
used to determine what's in focus. In fact, the model 
is not circular, but its steps are cyclic. The processor 
cycles through the three processes for each sentence in 
the discourse. This cycling differs from logical circu- 
larity because it depends on new information present- 
ed over time, the time of each sentence of the dis- 
course. 
For example, reconsider the first few sentences of 
D2, given previously. Initially the speaker mentions 
two dogs, which become the discourse focus, and then 
he extends the discussion of them using "one.. .the 
other" anaphors. The actor focus is the speaker. Us- 
ing a definite noun phrase anaphor "the poodle," the 
speaker turns his attention to the that dog, and it be- 
comes the discourse focus and the actor focus. Using 
another definite noun phrase anaphor "the cocker,"  
the speaker changes the discourse focus to the cocker. 
The speaker's concluding sentence expands the dis- 
course focus back to both dogs with the use of 
" them."  
In Sidner 1979 a machine for choosing and updat- 
ing the discourse focus and actor focus is given. The 
machine chooses items in the discourse to serve as 
"expected" foci after the first sentence of a discourse 
and uses the interpretation of pronouns as well as 
non-pronoun anaphors to determine whether its ex- 
pected choices were correct. The machine updates the 
discourse and actor focus after each sentence and 
changes foci when the anaphoric expressions no longer 
co-specify with the item in focus. This simple machine 
tracks the foci from the hearer 's point of view and 
shows how the hearer can recognize foci and changes 
of loci. In the remaining discussion, it is assumed that 
the focus machine can determine a discourse and an 
actor focus. Our attention is directed at the following 
concerns. How can these two foci be used to interpret 
discourse pronouns? What rules are used by the pro- 
noun interpreter? How do these rules make use of the 
constraints on the theory of pronoun interpretation 
discussed earlier in this paper? 
The focusing theory of pronoun interpretation can 
be outlined as follows. At any time in the discourse 
after the first sentence, there are loci that are the 
prime candidates for co-specifying with a pronoun. 
Also available is a list of alternate candidates, called 
potential foci, for each focus. Unless the focus candi- 
date is ruled oflt by certain criteria (to be discussed 
below), the pronoun interpreter uses it to determine 
the specification of the pronoun. Most of the discus- 
sion in this paper concerns the criteria that must be 
encoded in the rules for choosing among the foci as 
well as the criteria for rejecting a focus in favor of one 
of the potential foci. 
The proposal made here contains two implicit proc- 
essing assumptions, (1) serial processing, and (2) end- 
of-sentence processing. By "serial processing", I
mean that the interpreter checks a focus as a candidate 
in interpreting the pronoun, and then if that focus is 
unacceptable, checks alternate candidates in turn. By 
"end-of -sentence processing", I mean that pronouns 
are not interpreted until the entire sentence has been 
syntactically and semantically interpreted. Both of 
these criteria could be given up without undermining 
the focusing theory. One could envision processing in 
parallel by checking the foci and alternates and then 
determining the pronoun's pecification from an order- 
ing of all those candidates that meet the criteria of 
choice. To interpret pronouns before the end of the 
sentence, the interpreter could decide using available 
information and then review its choice as more of the 
sentence is processed. These two implicit processing 
assumptions have been made because they simplify the 
account of focus and because they reflect an imple- 
mented version of one focus system. Further research 
will indicate whether these assumptions are too strong 
- if so, the focusing theory may be re-tested under 
parallel and mid-sentence interpretation assumptions. 
4. Using Focus for Pronoun Interpretat ion Rules 
The pronouns in the example discourse in the pre- 
ceding section can be interpreted with a simple rule: 
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 221 
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns 
RI:  Choose the discourse focus as the co- 
specifier of the pronoun. But if the pro- 
noun appears in the agent position of the 
verb case frame structure, then choose the 
actor focus. 
R1 is a naive formulation and fails to predict accu- 
rately over a wide range of phenomena. It can be 
revised to include criteria from syntax, semantics and 
pragmatics, as well as criteria about discourse charac- 
teristics. In the next several pages, I present criteria 
that make use of all four sources of knowledge and 
incorporate them into R1 to form a series of pi-rules; 
these rules make use of the discourse and actor foci, 
the potential loci, and the processing of the focus 
machine. 
Syntax, semantics and pragmatics can be included 
in an initial way by the modification R2: 
R2: If a pronoun appears in a verb case frame 
relation other than agent, choose the dis- 
course focus as co-specifier unless any of 
the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic 
knowledge constraints rule out the choice. 
If the pronoun appears in agent position, 
choose the actor focus as co-specifier in 
the same way. 
Ruling out a co-specifier on the basis of syntactic 
and semantic onstraints is accomplished by computing 
the various syntactic relationships and restrictions 
(such as Lasnik's disjoint reference rules) and by use 
of semantic selectional restrictions on case frame cate- 
gories. How one uses general knowledge constraints is 
not so obvious; one wants to avoid the problems of 
control on inference mentioned previously. 
The focus rule above, although only a skeleton of 
the full rules needed, contains the basis for control of 
inferences. Under the method of rule R2, inference is 
no longer used to find a binding for the pronoun act- 
ing as a variable by forward and backward chaining. 
Instead inference is a constraint-checking process. 
The context up to the sentence under interpretation is
integrated into memory; when a co-specifier is chosen 
for the pronoun, inferring serves only to find a contra- 
diction in the database. The database will also include 
an interpreted form of the sentence with the pronoun, 
with the pronoun replaced by its specification as pre- 
dicted from the phrase in focus. Only when a contra- 
diction is found, is the suggested specification given up 
in favor of another choice. The loci of the discourse 
can be additionally helpful in database inference be- 
cause only that part of the database that concerns 
what is in focus needs to be explored for contradic- 
tions. Some research on truth maintenance systems 
\[Doyle 1978, McAllester 1978\] has experimented with 
constraint-checking and developed algorithms for effi- 
ciently finding and undoing contradictions; however, 
no one has considered how to explore only certain 
"sub-sect ions" of a database for contradictions. 
On this account of inferring and pronoun interpre- 
tation, the inference machine must still infer proposi- 
tions and reach contradictions. However, this method 
reduces the search needed to make sense of the new 
sentence because specific choices for the pronouns are 
given; when a contradiction is reached, a new choice is 
made rather than either blindly binding the pronoun to 
some other object or blindly searching for some other 
proposit ion to change, so that the contradict ion is 
eliminated. 
When a suggested co-specifier for a pronoun must 
be given up, the pronoun interpreter must use the 
potential foci as possible co-specifiers. However,  the 
interpreter's actual choices require consideration of 
several matters, and before any rules can be stated, 
several motivating cases must be presented. 
D3-1 Alfred and Zohar liked to play baseball. 
2 They played it everyday after school 
before dinner. 
3 After their game, Alfred and Zohar had 
ice cream cones. 
4 The boys thought they tasted really good. 
5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper, 
6 while Zohar tried the flavor of the day cone. 
7 After the cones had been eaten, 
8 the boys went home to study. 
In D3, Alfred and Zohar are the initial actor focus 
while baseball  is the initial discourse focus. D3-2 
contains two pronouns, " they"  and " i t "  which, ac- 
cording to R2, co-specify respectively with Alfred and 
Zohar, and baseball. D3-3 uses "their ,"  which co- 
specifies with Alfred and Zohar, but is not accounted 
for by rule R2. Furthermore " they"  in D3-4 does not 
co-specify with baseball  but with ice cream cones. 
What has happened? 
Suppose in addition to the ongoing actor and dis- 
course focus, the hearer can consider temporari ly any 
new entities mentioned in the last sentence that the 
hearer has heard. These entities, the potential foci, are 
dropped out of processing use if the speaker fails to 
mention them a second time; such alternatives are 
elements the speaker may want to say more about, but 
their importance to the speaker cannot be determined 
from one sentence. Thus in D3-2, foci include the 
event of playing, and the times "everyday" ,  "before 
dinner," and "after  school". None of these potentials 
survives long into the discourse as D3-3 fails to pick 
up on any of them. D3-3 in turn introduces some 
other potential oci, and one of them, ice cream cones, 
is discussed in D3-4; notice also that D3-4 fails to 
mention baseball in any way. 
222 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns 
R2 must be extended so that it uses the potential 
foci whenever criteria from syntax, semantics or prag- 
matic knowledge rule out the current actor or dis- 
course focus. Thus since "they" in D3-4 cannot co- 
specify with baseball (on both syntactic 5 and semantic 6 
grounds), a potential focus is chosen. Potential foci 
are ordered according to their thematic relation 7 in a 
sentence, with semantic case objects first, and agents 
last. The first potential focus that meets all the const- 
raints is chosen as the co-specifier; in D3, ice cream 
cones is the first acceptable potential focus that meets 
all the necessary constraints as a co-specifier for 
"they." 
Use of this modified pronoun rule follows hand-in- 
hand with the focus machine discussed previously. 
The machine updates its discourse model after each 
sentence by tracking, among other things, pronoun 
use. When a pronoun is used to co-specify with a 
phrase that is a potential focus, and no phrase co- 
specifies the current focus, either the discourse focus 
or actor focus moves to that potential focus. Which of 
the two foci moves depends on whether the pronoun 
fills the agent case in the verb frame, and in the case 
of multiple agent cases, whether the ongoing actor 
focus is re-mentioned. For example, after D3-4, the 
discourse focus changes to ice cream cones because 
"they" co-specifies with the ice cream cones; the boys 
remain the actor focus, since "they" is not an agent 
case for "taste" and since the boys were already the 
actor focus. 
So far pi-rules take into account the movement of 
focus and constraints on syntax, semantics and prag- 
matics. However, some of the semantic and pragmatic 
criteria must be expanded beyond the simple case 
frame semantics and representation of noun phrases 
given earlier. 
As the reader may have concluded, the interaction 
between actor and discourse loci is a complex one; to 
supplement the case frame semantics, some functional 
notion of theme (in the sense of functionalists uch as 
Halliday 1967) is needed. For example, the proper 
co-specifier for the pronoun in D4-3 cannot be chosen 
with R2 and only simple case frame relations. 
D4-1 I haven't seen Jeff for several days. 
2 Carl thinks he's studying for his exams. 
3 But I think he went to the Cape with Linda. 
Although Carl is the actor focus after D4-2, and "he" 
in D4-3 is the actor case in the embedded sentence, 
the proper choice for the co-specifier is Jeff. Howev- 
5 since "they" is a plural pronoun and baseball is singular, 
6 since the discourse items filling the object case of taste 
should be tastable items, 
7 This type of ordering is motivated by the determination of 
an initial focus. See Sidner 1979 for details. 
er, with simple case frame semantics, the interpreter 
must consider "Carl"  as the co-specifier and then fail 
to rule it out (because no syntactic, semantic or 
knowledge constraints can eliminate it). 
I have designed the pi-rules to use a semantics that 
marks verbs like "thinking" or "talking" with who the 
thinking or talking was about. D4-3 would indicate 
that the speaker thinks about X, that X went to the 
Cape with Linda. With this semantics, the interpreter 
follows a rule to prefer the discourse focus as the co- 
specifier of any pronoun filling the theme position in 
such a verb. Since the actor focus is associated with 
the agent case, use of such a theme-based rule is con- 
sistent with the framework. With such a rule, Jeff is 
chosen as the co-specifier of "he," not because Carl 
couldn't have gone to the Cape with Linda, but be- 
cause the speaker is talking about Jeff and his 
thoughts about Jeff. In essence this approach takes 
the discourse focus as primary, the discourse focus 
being what the speaker is talking about so far, while 
the actor focus is the locus of information about ac- 
tions in the discourse. 
The theme-focus rule does not indicate what to do 
when the discourse focus and actor focus are both 
animate, have the same gender, number and person, 
and are both established uring the same sentence of 
the discourse. People sometimes have difficulty 
choosing interpretations in such circumstances. In 
D5-2a below, "he" co-specifies with " John" (the actor 
focus) but if D5-2b followed D5-1, "he"  may co- 
specify with either John or Mike (the discourse focus). 
D5-1 John called up Mike yesterday. 
2 a He wanted to discuss his physics homework. 
b He was studying for his driver's test. 
In these cases, native speakers report that the co- 
specifier for the pronoun is ambiguous. If the pro- 
noun fills an agent case, the actor is preferred, but this 
preference is not a strong one. It appears that in such 
cases the ambiguity may not be easily resolved unless 
additional information about the two foci is known 
that stipulates that the sentence is true of only one. 
Potential foci can be sub-categorized as either po- 
tential discourse loci or as potential actor foci. A 
potential actor is a noun phrase which specifies a data- 
base element marked as animate and which does not 
occur in agent position. In most sentences, the noun 
phrase in agent position contains a descriptive word or 
name in the head, and specifies a database lement; it 
becomes the actor focus. But when the noun phrase 
in agent position is a pronoun, it may co-specify with 
either the actor focus (if one exists), or a potential 
actor. Ambiguities occur when an actor and one po- 
tential actor are both present in a previous sentence 
and when the discourse focus is a non-actor entity. 
An example is given below. 
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 223 
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns 
Consider the examples where s5 follows each of s6, 
s7, s8 and s9. 
s5 He knows a lot about high energy physics. 
s6 Prof. Darby will tell Monty about the 
neutron experiment. 
s7 Prof. Darby will lecture Monty on the 
neutron experiment. 
s8 Prof. Darby will help Monty with the 
neutron experiment. 
s9 Prof. Darby will teach Monty about the 
neutron experiment. 
Some native speakers find all of these sentence pairs 
ambiguous, while some native speakers find only the 
pair s6 followed by s5 ambiguous. These examples are 
surprisingly similar to D5. How do some speakers 
decide that "he"  co-specifies with Monty or Prof. 
Darby? It appears that they make a comparison and 
choose between the actor focus and the potential actor 
on the basis of evidence for their preferred interpreta- 
tion. When that evidence is not forthcoming, infor- 
mants are confused. Such a behavior suggests that the 
inference mechanism should be able to judge prefer- 
ences between a given actor and one potential actor. 
A computational system that makes such judgments 
must have a very rich knowledge base (e.g., to know 
that Monty is a male name, and that professors may 
be male) and must be able to infer which actor is pref- 
erable from that base. A computational framework 
for carrying out such subtle judgments is still beyond 
the state of the art, although Marcus 1980 has pro- 
posed a semantic choice mechanism that must also 
weigh evidence for preposit ional phrase attachment; 
his parser, when attaching prepositional phrases, asks 
the semantic processor about its preferences for where 
to attach the phrases. 
In summary, the interpreter can use the following 
condition for these ambiguities. 
POTENTIAL  ACTOR AMBIGUITY  CONDI -  
TION: Whenever a pronoun may co-specify the 
actor focus, and a single potential actor exists, 
expect a possible ambiguity. To resolve, 
1. If there is evidence supporting the actor fo- 
cus as the co-specifier, but not the potential 
actor, then the actor focus is the co-specifier. 
2. When evidence supports the potential actor 
but not the actor focus, select the potential 
actor as the co-specifier. 
3. However, if there is evidence for both, select 
the actor focus but indicate ambiguity. 
A summary of a full set of pronoun rules is given in 
the appendix to this paper. These rules represent what 
can be said about pronoun interpretation in the ab- 
sence of any additional information in knowledge rep- 
resentation beyond that suggested in the discussion of 
co-specification. To interpret certain pronouns, such 
as those where a co-specifying phrase does not pre- 
cede the pronoun in the discourse, as in D1, we must 
consider how knowledge is structured and represented. 
5. Focus and Knowledge Representat ion 
Focusing theory with the syntactic and semantic 
representations discussed initially does not include an 
account of the representation of sentence pairs such as 
D6 where the sentence is ambiguous due to scope of 
quantifiers. 
D6-1 Wendy showed each girl Bruce knows a cat. 
2 a She had found it at Farmer John's. 
b They were all from the same litter. 
At present he focusing rules predict only that "a  cat" 
is the expected discourse focus, but they say nothing 
about the scope relations for representing the seman- 
tics of the phrase as part of D6-1. Without scope 
relations, D6-2b is ruled out by the number agreement 
criteria when in fact most speakers say that " they"  
co-specifies with the set of cats that may be evoked in 
D6-1. Webber 1978 not only argues in detail for rep- 
resenting scope relations in the mechanisms for inter- 
preting anaphors, but also gives rules for determining 
scope in a representation of phrases that may be co- 
specifiers. 
On Webber 's  analysis, D6-1 will have two repre- 
sentations for "a  cat"  and for "each girl Bruce 
knows." The one for "a cat" can be paraphrased as: 
1. R I :  the cat associated with D6-1 such that Wendy 
showed it to each girl Bruce knows. 
2. R2: the set of cats, the members of which are asso- 
ciated with D6-1 such that Wendy showed (one of) 
them to each girl Bruce knows. 
Webber has suggested what the representation must 
be, and what remains to be determined is when it is 
used. Let us suppose that D6-1 is ambiguous,8 and no 
syntactic or semantic processing of it adjudicates the 
two readings R1 and R2 for "a cat." When the pro- 
noun interpreter seeks to co-specify " i t "  in D6-2a 
with the discourse focus, both readings will be availa- 
ble. The set reading R2 may be eliminated immediate- 
ly because of constraints that the co-specifier epre- 
sent a singleton, so R1 is left. In contrast, for D6-2b 
the reading R1 will be ruled out since " they"  requires 
a plural co-specifier. This account both explains how 
the pronouns may be understood, and also is consist- 
ent with Van Lehn's findings \[1978\] that people do 
8 A question, often raised by Martin (see, for example, Martin 
1979), is whether a sentence that is ambiguous among several 
readings must be represented by several different structures, one for 
each reading. He offers a semantic representation that preserves 
ambiguity until some processor demands a refinement. Whether 
this approach or an alternative representation containing both 
readings i  best is still an open question. 
224 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns 
not normally disambiguate certain ambiguous quantifi- 
er scopes during sentence understanding for sentences 
such as D6-1. It is compatible with Van Lehn's find- 
ings because alternative interpretations of scope are 
not considered until additional discourse material be- 
yond the single sentence is presented. 
Webber 's  rules also allow the phrase "each girl 
Bruce knows" to be interpreted as a prototype, with 
the result that "a cat" is also. Most speakers find this 
reading very odd, and one can ask how such a reading 
is eliminated. Possibly it is never generated, and 
Webber's rules need modification. Alternatively it is 
produced, and then is ruled out, either in understand- 
ing D6-1 because showing prototypic cats is bizarre, 
or because in interpreting " i t"  for D6-2a, the infer- 
ence mechanism balks at Wendy having found a proto- 
typic cat at Farmer Brown's. I think that such read- 
ings never occur in the first place, simply because most 
speakers, who do not report this reading themselves, 
have difficulty understanding the reading when they 
are told about it. 
Another case of semantic ambiguity, similar to the 
one in D6, is illustrated in D7. 
D7-1 Sally wanted to buy a vegomatic. 
2 She had seen it advertised on TV. 
"A  vegomatic"  may be interpreted specifically, to 
mean that there is one particular vegomatic or non- 
specifically, to mean that it is one of the many vego- 
matics. 9 The focusing rules do not distinguish between 
the two after D7-1 because, like D6-1, D7-1 is ambi- 
guous, and neither interpretation can be chosen with 
certainty. When " i t"  is resolved for co-specification 
in D7-2, the inference mechanism must decide that 
Sally does not want the very one used in the advertise- 
ment on TV. "A  vegomatic," whether understood as 
specific or non-specific, specifies a different represent- 
ation than " i t"  does. Therefore the pronoun's pecifi- 
cation as a specific vegomatic must be generated from 
the ambiguous use. 
Suppose, for a moment, that D7-1 is interpreted so 
that a representation that maintains ambiguity is avail- 
able. When the pronoun interpreter processes a sub- 
sequent sentence with a pronoun, it need only rule out 
readings if the inference machine discounts as contra- 
dictory one of the readings (Sally didn't want to buy 
the very one she saw on TV). If no reading is ruled 
out, the co-specifier would remain ambiguous, so that 
both the indefinite phrase and the pronoun would have 
9 The terms "non-specif ic" and "specific" are traditional 
semantic expressions that bear no relation to "specify" and 
"specification." A non-specific reading of "a dog" would be inter- 
preted to produce a representation f an instance of the prototypic 
dog; what is represented is a dog which has the characteristics of 
the prototypic dog - e.g., an animal with four legs, a tail, medium 
size, brown, friendly, barks, and the like. 
ambiguous co-specifications. As the next example 
shows, there is some evidence for this behavior. 
Consider the case shown in D8. 
D8-1 Sally bought a vegomatic that had a 
broken cutting blade. 
2 She had seen it advertised on TV. 
"A  vegomatic that had a broken cutting blade" in the 
context of D8-1 usually means some particular vego- 
matic that Sally bought. However, " i t"  is ambiguous 
among the vegomatic Sally bought (the broken one), 
some vegomatic (possibly not broken), and a vegomat- 
ic that is an instance of prototypic vegomatic. Thus 
" i t"  is three ways ambiguous. 
To understand D8-2, the pronoun interpreter does 
not distinguish among the three readings, since it ac- 
cesses the one provided by the specification in D8-1, 
which is the specific reading. To find the specification 
of " it ," the inference mechanism must discover that it 
is slightly odd (1) for Sally to have seen the vegomatic 
with a broken blade which she bought being advertised 
on TV, and (2) for Sally to see any broken vegomatics 
on TV, and (3) for Sally to have seen the very one she 
bought on TV. Then if no other choices for co- 
specification are available, the specification of vego- 
matic from D8-1 must be used to generate an appro- 
priate specification for "it". Since only unbroken ones 
not bought by Sally are appropriate, the specification 
of " i t "  must be generated using only part of the 
phrase from D8-1. 
This example seems problematic because it places 
much weight on the inference machine to decide that 
the reading is odd. However, this is likely to be just 
where the weight of the decision ought to be; many 
native speakers find D8 slightly bizarre because their 
first reading is that Sally had seen the vegomatic with 
the broken blade advertised on TV. In fact, it appears 
that when a specific indefinite noun phrase such as "a 
vegomatie"  is introduced, and the speaker wants to 
turn attention to the non-specif ic reading, a plural 
pronoun is used as shown below: 
s l0 She had seen them advertised on TV. 
The plural non-specific reading as in s l0  is mentioned 
in the pronoun rules found in the appendix, but the 
generation of a specification as in D8-2 is not. 
Examples such as D8 are perplexing for another 
reason; they are examples of what I call, following 
Fahlman 1977, the "copy phenomenon."  The ambigu- 
ity centers around the fact that there can be many 
copies of an abstract prototype. Automobiles, com- 
puter programs, airplane flights and money are other 
common cases of entities that exhibit the copy phe- 
nomenon. In D9, the interpretation of " i t"  depends 
on whether the speaker is referring to a particular 
flight or the normal Sunday flight, a copy of which 
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 225 
Candace L. Sidner Focusing for Interpretation of Pronouns 
occurred on "this Sunday" because of the use of 
"usually". 
D9-1 TWA 384 was so bumpy this Sunday I
almost got sick. 
2 It usually is a very smooth flight. 
Note that the "it" cannot co-specify with the particular 
flight on "this Sunday". However, it is possible that 
the speaker used "TWA 384" to refer to a particular 
flight; if this is so, the speaker mixed the specific and 
non-specific interpretations for the co-specifier of 
"it". Just as in D8, a specification for the pronoun 
must be generated - -  in this case, a non-specific one 
from the specific reading. 
Another characteristic anaphora is the bound varia- 
ble case described by Partee \[1978, 1972\]. In D10 
below, "him" co-specifies with Archibald, while if the 
reflexive "himself" were used, it would involve a vari- 
able bound to the quantifier from "every man." 
D10-1 Archibald sat down on the floor. 
2 Every man put a screen in front of him. 
In linguistic theory, bound variables are assumed to be 
represented in sentence semantics; when used in con- 
junction with syntactic disjoint reference rules, pro- 
nouns within the scope of the quantifier can be distin- 
guished from non-scoped ones. Since the pronoun 
interpreter takes account of these conditions, it can 
easily choose a proper co-specifier for "him" in D10 
in terms of the focus, but for "himself" it will recog- 
nize the bound relation to "every man." It is crucial 
to these cases that the representation of the interpreta- 
tion of a sentence includes scope of quantification, 
especially when the scope is unambiguous. 
6. Focus Restr ic t ions on Co-spec i f i cat ion  
There are other restrictions on co-specification that 
result from the processing of the focus machine. The 
focus machine includes a stack on which old foci are 
stored when the focus changes. In addition to co- 
specifications with current actor and discourse foci, a 
speaker may use a pronoun to co-specify a discourse 
element hat was once in focus but is no longer; Grosz 
1977 described and illustrated this behavior for ana- 
phoric noun phrases in task-oriented dialogues. 
A pi-rule that selects candidates from the focus 
stack can capture this behavior. However, the rule 
must be further constrained. An anaphor that is in- 
tended to co-specify with a stacked focus must not be 
acceptable as a co-specifier with either the foci or 
potential oci. An example from a literary text10 illus- 
trates how. 
Was that old lady evil, the one Saul and I 
had seen sitting on the porch? I had dreamed 
about her. When the trolley car took me and 
Saul past her house again this morning, she was 
gone. Evil, it had a queer sound to it in Eng- 
lish. 
\[Here the narrative moves on to an incident 
in a school classroom. A discussion between the 
speaker and a male teacher ensues for five para- 
graphs. Then the following paragraph begins:\] 
She had worn an old brown coat and a green 
scarf over her head. 
In this example, "she" co-specifies with the old lady 
discussed previously. If Potok had told of a discussion 
between the speaker and a female teacher, it would no 
longer be possible to tell that "she" was co-specifying 
with the old woman. While interpreting the reading of 
"she" as teacher might be a bit surprising because the 
teacher's clothing was not relevant to the previous 
conversation, no inference can rule out that reading 
because teachers may wear old brown coats. Hence 
the pronoun interpreter must reflect these facts, and it 
does so with the stacked focus constraint. 
The stacked focus constraint is not stated directly 
within the pi-rules. Instead it is implicit in their func- 
tion. The condition is as follows: A pronoun cannot 
be used to co-specify with a stacked focus when a 
current focus is an acceptable co-specification since 
that current focus will be taken as the interpretation 
and the stacked focus will never come into considera- 
tion. The stacked focus constraint is a consequence of
the movement of focus in the focus machinery. 
The stacked focus constraint, however, may be 
overridden. Grosz (see Deutsch 1975, 1974) has 
identified several examples, involving pumps and bolt- 
ing operations, that show that a pronoun may co- 
specify with the stacked focus even when intervening 
material contains possible co-specifiers. Some compli- 
cated set of inferences about what can and cannot be 
bolted to what, or what can and cannot be loosened 
might be able to rule out the intervening possible co- 
specifications. However there appears to be too little 
delay in understanding for people who read her ex- 
cerpts (there is no means of determining whether the 
original speaker and hearer experienced any delay in 
understanding) to suggest hat they are ruling out mul- 
tiple possibilities in interpreting the pronouns, it
Hence one may conclude that the speaker and hearer 
are taking advantage of their knowledge of the task to 
provide a discourse context in which the focusing ma- 
chinery can be applied. 
How many such discourse interpretation mecha- 
nisms exist? While this paper does not address this 
question directly, some speculation is possible on the 
10 In the Beginning by Chaim Potok, page 212, chapter 4, 
Fawcett Publications, Inc., Conn.,  1975. 
11 This informal evidence needs to be tested out in a psycho- 
logical laboratory. I have not done so, but the results of such 
experimentation would be revealing. 
226 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981

basis of research that has been reported elsewhere (see 
Sidner 1979, Robinson 1981). In general, it appears 
that discourses permitting violations of the stacked 
focus constraint must contain an implicit structure of 
task completion that guides the hearer to a context in 
which the foci for that context may be re-used. With- 
out this structure the hearer cannot decide that the 
speaker intended for the pronoun to co-specify with 
something other than the representation of the object 
currently under discussion. 
7. Pronouns Which Have No Co-specifiers 
The previous discussion has assumed that a pro- 
noun is always preceded by a co-specifying phrase. 
However, this is not always the case, and a complete 
theory of pronoun interpretation must address cases 
where the co-specifying phrase appears after the pro- 
noun, and where no co-specifier exists, but the discus- 
sion implies a specification for the pronoun. 
Pronouns used with their co-specifiers appearing 
after the occurrence of the pronoun have been called 
backward anaphora in the linguistic literature; I refer 
to them as forward co-specifiers. Two such examples, 
s l l  and s12, are given below. 
sl 1 If he comes before the show, give John 
these tickets and send him to the theatre. 
s12 Near him, Dan saw a snake. 
In general the pronoun co-specifies with some noun 
phrase interpretation, but the phrase is placed forward 
in the discourse. The types of sentences in which this 
behavior can occur are limited. In general it seems to 
be permitted for fronted sentential prepositional phras- 
es (as in s12), subordinate clauses fronted on another 
sentence (as in s l l ) ,  and for sentences containing 
co-ordinating conjunctions, t2 However, it is excluded, 
as far as I can tell, in the following cases: 13 
s13 * I heard about her job from Mary. 
s14 * I spoke about him with John's wife. 
Extensive research in linguistics on forward co- 
specifiers (Solan contains a good review) gives reliable 
evidence that structural constraints govern it; in par- 
ticular, syntactic rules can be stated that determine 
when forward co-specifiers are not permitted. The 
most recent formulation, by Solan, called the back- 
ward anaphora restriction, fails on the cases below, 
12 Solan 1978 cites the example: 
s15 Penelope grabbed his cane and beat Peter with it. 
13 There is some disagreement on s13; Solan claims it is 
acceptable. All the native speakers I have asked said they inter- 
preted the pronoun as "referring to Mary" only because there were 
no other usual choices and because you could hear about a person's 
job from that person. Since all the people I asked informally told 
me it was a strange sentence for them, I am assuming that it is 
deviant. 
but some working modification of it may yet be forth- 
coming. 
s16 In her room Mary saw a ghost. 
s17 I heard about Mary's job from her. 
Whatever the best formulation of the syntactic 
rules for forward co-specifiers, they are preferable 
only in initial sentences of a discourse. For example, 
when s l l  occurs in mid-discourse, if a speaker has 
been talking about Henry, and just begun mention of 
Charles, native speakers will interpret "he"  as co- 
specifying with Henry, or Charles (if Henry can be 
ruled out on basis of some special pragmatic knowl- 
edge). The pi-rules using focus behave in exactly this 
way. They will permit a forward co-specifier only if 
Henry and Charles can be ruled out by syntactic, se- 
mantic and world knowledge criteria. Were s l l  to 
occur when Lydia was in focus, the forward co- 
specifier would be possible, and pi-rules mirror this 
behavior. 
When faced with a pronoun that has no preceding 
co-specifier and is not a forward co-specifier, the pro- 
noun interpreter relies on a condition that is called the 
missing co-specifier condition. In the remainder of this 
section, I describe that condition. The pi-rules include 
a rule for recognizing that a pronoun is missing its 
co-specifier, but they do not offer an interpretation for 
such pronouns. 
In each of the cases below, the pronoun specifies 
some cognitive element that is related to one of the 
entities mentioned in either the previous sentence or 
the same sentence. These examples 14 are different 
from the non-specific prototypic readings of pronouns 
discussed earlier because no phrase which can be used 
as a generator exists. 
D l l -1  I saw Mr. Smith the other day; you know, 
she died last year. 
2 John is an orphan. He misses them very 
much. 
3 Pro-Castro people don't believe he is a 
monster.

With the exception of D11-1, most speaker-hearers are 
able to say which is the intended specification of the 
pronoun in the cases above. D11-1 can be understood 
14 The examples given here are from several sources; the first 
three are from Postal 1969, the fourth from Chafe 1975, the fifth 
from dialogues collected for the PAL system \[Sidner 1979\], and the 
last was spoken by a lecturer at a presentation I attended.

if the hearer is informed that Mr. Smith had a wife. 
However, some of these, especially 1 and 2, are so odd 
for most hearers that at first they fail to comprehend 
the pronoun. Hearers are divided on the acceptability 
of 3, and most hearers find 4 and 5 acceptable. Fur- 
thermore, such examples, as far as I can tell, do not 
occur naturally in written samples. 
This paper does not give an account of just how 
such cases are understood. However,  the focusing 
approach provides some basic structure that may be 
useful in generating an explanation for such situations. 
In all the multi-sentence cases, the pronoun specifies 
something which is closely associated with the focus. 
What is problematic is the fact that some speakers 
seem unable to understand a pronoun which specifies a 
database element that, while related to the item in 
focus, represents omething that no longer exists, such 
as John's parents in light of John's orphanhood. 
Whatever the manner in which hearers recover specifi- 
cations for such pronouns, some principles are needed 
which govern why some uses of pronouns are accepta- 
ble and others are not. 
8. The Problem of Paral lel ism 
The pi-rules give incorrect predictions for certain 
uses of pronouns, uses that are difficult to define. 
Intuitively, they may be characterized as occurring 
when there is a parallel structure between sentences of 
a discourse/5 In many of these cases the pi-rules pre- 
dict the wrong co-specifier. To understand what is 
meant by parallel structure, two simple cases, one in 
which the pi-rules do predict correctly, and another in 
which they fail, are discussed. In D12, the pronoun 
co-specifies with the mud pack, as the pi-rules would 
predict. The parallelism of these sentences is reflected 
in the semantics of "put on" and "pull of f"  as well as 
in the similarity of the syntactic structure of the two 
sentences, each being in imperative mood. 
D12-1 Put the mud pack on your face. 
2 After 5 minutes, pull it off. 
The pi-rules predict the proper co-specif ier in D12 
because the thematic relations of the verb follow the 
similarity of structure. However, in D13 below, the 
pronoun " i t"  co-specifies with rose and not with the 
green Whitierleaf (the pi-rule choice). The  initial 
focus after the first sentence is Whitierleaf, but the 
parallel syntactic structure of the sentences eems to 
govern a different choice of co-specifier. To summa- 
rize, between similarity of structure and the pi-rules, 
similarity is preferred as a means of choosing a co- 
15 Hobbs 1979 defines a parallel relation between sentences 
sO and S1 of a discourse as occurring when propositions P0 and PI ,  
which follow from SO and S1 respectively, have identical predicates, 
and arguments that are similar (p. 76). This concept of a parallel 
relation seems related to my intuitive characterization, but as de- 
fined does not capture the cases I discuss. 
specifier, so when each gives a different prediction, 
similarity of structure must be used. 
D13-1 The green Whitierleaf is most commonly 
found near the wild rose. 
2 The wild violet is found near it too. 
At first glance it appears that the pi-rules could be 
" f ixed"  by simply observing that the initial focus is 
wrong and that a potential focus should be chosen. 
However, no such option is available, for such a " f ix"  
requires that the inference machine reject the initial 
focus. To do so, the inference mechanism needs some 
knowledge about the world that indicates the unac- 
ceptability. For D13 no such knowledge could possi- 
bly be forthcoming since all the flora involved are 
found near one another. There is no knowledge to the 
effect that violets are found near wild roses and not 
near Whitierleafs. t6 
Another example of parallel structures is shown in 
D14. The parallel structures again are reflected in the 
similarity of the syntactic forms as well as the seman- 
tics of "most"  and "mine".  After D14-1, the initial 
focus is the car radiator that is associated with each 
car of "most  cars." Using the focusing rules, the pro- 
noun interpreter will take " i t "  to co-specify with that 
radiator. But this prediction is incorrect; " i t "  co- 
specifies with the radiator of the speaker's car/7 
D14-1 On most cars the radiator has a free bolt hook. 
2 But on mine, it has a floating bolt hook. 
The use of " i t"  here is similar to the instance of a 
prototype for " i t"  in D8. The two discourse examples 
differ because D14-2 has an underlying semantic form 
that parallels D14-1. D14-1 specifies a universal set 
of cars and says something about one of the parts for 
those cars; D14-2 specifies a set of one thing, the 
speaker's car, and says something about a part of it; 
the speaker's car is related to the universal car by 
instantiation. Thus " i t"  in D14-2 is not pointing to 
some instance of the prototypic radiator; it co- 
specifies with the radiator of the speaker 's  car, but 
" i t"  is related intensionally to the "radiator"  in D14- 
1. The similarity in the underlying semantics of D14-1 
and D14-2 must be used in interpreting the pronoun 
uses .  
One might wish to construct some special-purpose 
mechanism that looks for similarities in structure be- 
tween two sentences. This method is doomed for two 
reasons. First, parallelism exists in many aspects of 
language, and it happens at arbitrary levels of struc- 
16 In certain cases a special audience may have different 
responses to the parallelism above. For example, botanists who 
know what flowers are near others might behave differently. But 
even special audiences must sometimes use general techniques. 
Such is the case in the D13 example, because Whitierleafs exist only 
in my imagination. 
17 I thank R.C. Moore for suggesting this example.

ture rather than just syntactically. Second, at any 
given level, the problem of recognition of parallelism 
has plagued computational models of language since 
such models were first suggested. For example, pars- 
ing of English sentences containing conjunction is as 
yet an unsolved problem. Methods tried, such as 
those of Woods 1973 in LUNAR, fail because of over- 
generalization. Proper computational recognition of 
parallelism is still beyond the state of the art. 
The fact that interpretation of parallelism has failed 
for other aspects of computational models of language 
only indicates that the problem is a deep one. The 
example below is especially surprising because it dem- 
onstrates the use of parallel constructions that may be 
found between whole paragraphs in a discourse. The 
interpretation of "the schedule," used anaphorically in 
D15-7, is not ambiguous between "SOL,"  which is a 
kind of schedule, and the transmission schedule; read- 
ers recognize that the anaphor is unambiguous presum- 
ably because the process described in lines 5-7 paral- 
lels the one in lines 2-4. Whatever the proper account 
of parallelism for pronominal anaphora, it must also be 
generalizable to account for this kind of example, t8 
D15-1 The SOL is searched for an entry for the 
subscriber. 
2 If one is found, the subscriber's relative 
transmission time is computed according 
to formula-1. 
3 The subscriber's clock transmission time 
is computed according to formula-2. 
4 When the transmission time has been 
computed, it is inserted as the pri- 
mary entry in a transmission schedule. 
5 For each RATS entry, the RATS's rela- 
tive transmission time is computed 
according to formula-l ,  
6 and the RATS's clock transmission time is 
computed according to formula-2. 
7 The RATS transmission times are entered 
into the schedule. 
One possible consequence of these observations 
could be that the focus mechanism should be aban- 
doned in favor of some as yet unspecified mechanism 
that is able to determine parallel relations among sets 
of sentences in a discourse. However, methods for 
interpreting pronouns from parallel sentences and par- 
agraphs offer no constructive way of interpreting the 
pronouns in most of the examples presented in this 
paper. Many cases of co-specification occur where 
there is no similarity of structure other than the com- 
18 For easier understanding, the reader must know that the 
SOL has both subscriber and RATS entries. This example comes 
from Balzer et al 1977, "Information in Program Specification,"

Intelligence, p. 394. 
mon subject-verb-object pattern typical of English 
sentences. Since what is being talked about appears in 
many constituent positions in sentences of a discourse, 
the S-V-O pattern is too gross a level to specify simi- 
larity. Hence, while parallelism is needed to deal with 
a certain set of cases for which the pi-rules predict 
incorrectly, the pi-rules are effective for many other 
cases of co-specification where parallelism would not 
be helpful. One may conclude that focus mechanisms 
account for one aspect of pragmatic anaphora, and 
that some different mechanism is needed to encode 
similarities in structure that sometimes occur in dis- 
course. This paper does not give an account of such a 
mechanism. Rather, the examples above provide some 
additional observations about the nature of parallelism 
in interpreting pronouns in natural anguages. 
9. Conc lus ions  
Two claims have been substantiated in this paper. 
First, I have shown that focusing is compatible with 
linguistic rules for disjoint reference, semantic selec- 
tional restrictions, and with representations delimiting 
quantifier scope. Furthermore, these sources of infor- 
mation are necessary for the pronoun interpretation 
rules. 
Second, I have demonstrated that  focusing helps 
control the inference process needed to interpret pro- 
nouns. The pronoun interpreter predicts a co-specifier 
and then asks the inference machine for confirmation; 
when the machine finds a contradiction rather than 
consistency, the focusing process produces a new can- 
didate co-specifier. In effect, the focusing process and 
the inference machine collaborate on pronoun inter- 
pretation. In previous AI natural language systems, 
interpretation resulted from binding of free variables 
when making inference; the inference process could be 
characterized as one of proving a consequent from a 
set of premises. However, because the consequent of 
an inference rule contained free variables, many infer- 
ences had to be drawn and then "undone" during the 
search for a complete chain of inferences. The focus- 
ing approach eliminates this kind of blind binding and 
unbinding as well as shortens the inference chain 
search. 
A part of this paper has described and illustrated 
how the pronoun interpretation rules predict the co- 
specifiers of pronouns with both the actor and the 
discourse focus, and indicated that both actor and 
discourse foci are necessary. The rules show how 
many constraints - -  syntactic, semantic, and 
pragmatic 19 - -  affect the choice of specification for 
pronouns; they also show how many kinds of informa- 
19 Phonological constraints have not been discussed in this 
paper. However, ules for contrastive stress and the like could be 
incorporated in the way that the other three classes are.

part  in d ist inguish ing the co-spec i f i cat ions  of  pro-  
nouns. By means of the discourse and actor  foci, the 
pi-rules d i f ferent ia l ly  apply the constraints;  the predic-  
t ions which result are tested in the database represent -  
at ion of the speaker  and hearer ' s  world.  Focus ing  
captures the effects of foregrounding (cf. Chafe  1975) 
since focusing accounts  for the co-spec i f i cat ions  of 
pronouns  by means of the foci, and focus movement  
indicates how new entit ies may be foregrounded and 
pronominal ized.  
In this paper  I have demonst ra ted  the types of ana-  
phor ic  uses that cannot  be expla ined by the focusing 
theory.  These uses, the focus "popp ing"  cases de-  
scr ibed by Grosz,  and the paral le l ism cases, i l lustrate 
that in anaphor  interpretat ion,  other  kinds of processes 
that  are computat iona l ly  rea l i zab le  and cont ro l lab le  
are needed.  Fur thermore ,  an adequate  syntact ic  theo-  
ry of forward co-speci f iers ,  which remains to be dis- 
covered,  must be incorporated  in the syntact ic  cr i ter ia 
for the pronoun in terpretat ion  rules. 
This paper  further specif ies the nature of focusing 
as it re lates to a theory  of p ronoun interpretat ion.  A 
focus -based  theory  with st ipu lat ions for syntax,  se- 
mant ics  and in ferent ia l  knowledge,  prov ides  a pre-  
dict ive and exp lanatory  theory  of p ronoun interpreta-  
t ion. The theory  is pred ic t ive  because  it s t ipu lates  
legal and i l legal p ronoun uses as well as their  interpre-  
tat ions;  the l imits of its predict ive power  have been 
demonst ra ted  as well. The theory  is exp lanatory  be-  
cause several  observat ions  about  anaphora  in Engl ish,  
all crucial  to focusing theory,  can account  for each of 
the rules: that  pronouns  are signals of what  is being 
discussed, that  whenever  the discussion changes,  pro-  
nouns must signal the new e lement  of discussion with-  
out confusion,  and that hearers  make use of syntact ic ,  
semant ic ,  and pragmat ic  knowledge in a cont ro l led  
way in understand ing anaphors.  A theory  of anaphor  
in terpretat ion  d i f ferent  f rom the focusing theory  needs 
ei ther to use these observat ions  in an account  of the 
facts or to demonst ra te  why these observat ions  are not  
re levant  o the in terpretat ion  process.  
Append ix .  Pronoun In terpretat ion  Rules 
The rules in this appendix  assume the avai labi l i ty of 
an actor  focus, d iscourse focus,  potent ia l  actor  and 
potent ia l  d iscourse foci. The pronoun interpreter  ap- 
pl ies these rules in the order  given. 
Agent position pronouns 
1. When a sentence in which a pronoun occurs is the sec- 
ond sentence of a new discourse, the recency rule may 
be applied. Recency rule: When a pronoun is in subject 
position and is the initial phrase in a sentence, and if a 
member of the potential (discourse or actor) foci occurs 
as the last phrase in the previous sentence, test the pro- 
noun for co-specifying with that potential focus. 
2. Theme rule: When the pronoun occurs in an embedded 
sentence, if the embedded sentence is marked as having 
a theme that is either the discourse or actor focus, test 
the focus in that theme position as the co-specifier of the 
pronoun. 
3. Potential actor ambiguity condition: Whenever a pronoun 
may co-specify the actor focus, and a single potential 
actor exists, expect a possible ambiguity. To resolve, (1) 
if there is evidence supporting the actor focus as the 
co-specifier, but not the potential actor, then the actor 
focus is the co-specifier. (2) When evidence supports 
the potential actor but not the actor focus, choose the 
potential actor as the co-specifier. (3) However, if there 
is evidence for both, choose the actor focus but indicate 
ambiguity. 
4. Pronominalized actor focus rule: When the actor focus 
was last mentioned with a pronoun, if the agent position 
pronoun is of the same gender and person as the actor 
focus, it must co-specify with the actor focus. If it does 
not, a potential actor focus may be chosen, but the pro- 
noun use is odd. 
5. Plural rule: If the pronoun in question is plural, while 
the actor focus is singular, test items in the following list 
for co-specification: a non-specific reading of the focus 
(only for foci that specify non-human entities), actor 
focus and potential actor foci, all the potential actor loci 
together, the discourse focus, and the potential discourse 
foci. 
6. Basic rule: Test the actor foci as a co-specifier with a 
pronoun in agent position followed by potential actor 
foci. If these fail, check the discourse focus, potential 
discourse foci and actor focus stack. 
7. Closure rule: Should all other rules fail, if the pronoun 
occurs in an introductory clause, expect a forward co- 
specifier. If the pronoun is not in an introductory 
clause, an instance of the missing co-specifier condition 
has occurred. 
Non-agent position pronouns 
1. When a sentence in which a pronoun occurs is the sec- 
ond sentence of a new discourse, the recency rule may 
be applied. Recency rule: When a pronoun is in subject 
position and is the initial phrase in a sentence, and if a 
member of the potential (discourse or actor) foci occurs 
as the last phrase in the previous sentence, test the pro- 
noun for co-specifying with that potential focus. 
2. Basic rule: Check the discourse focus, followed by po- 
tential discourse foci, followed by the actor focus. 
3. Plural pronoun rule: If the discourse focus is singular 
and the pronoun is plural, test the non-specific reading 
(only for foci that specify non-human entities) for co- 
specification, then potential discourse foci, followed by 
the actor focus. 
4. Focus related item rule: If some discourse entity has 
been related to the focus during the discourse, test it for 
co-specifying with the pronoun in question. 
5. Focus stack: Check items in the focus stack for co- 
specifying in last-in first-out order. 
6. Closure rule: When all the above rules fail, if the pro- 
noun occurs in an introductory clause, expect a forward 
co-specifier. Otherwise the pronoun is an instance of a 
missing co-specifier.
