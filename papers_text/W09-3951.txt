Abstract
In recent years Dialogue Acts have be-
come a popular means of modelling the
communicative intentions of human and
machine utterances in many modern di-
alogue systems. Many of these systems
rely heavily on the availability of dialogue
corpora that have been annotated with Di-
alogue Act labels. The manual annota-
tion of dialogue corpora is both tedious
and expensive. Consequently, there is a
growing interest in unsupervised systems
that are capable of automating the annota-
tion process. This paper investigates the
use of a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
as a means of clustering dialogue utter-
ances in an unsupervised manner. These
clusters can then be analysed in terms of
the possible Dialogue Acts that they might
represent. The results presented here are
from the application of the Dirichlet Pro-
cess Mixture Model to the Dihana corpus.
1 Introduction
Dialogue Acts (DAs) are an important contribu-
tion from discourse theory to the design of di-
alogue systems. These linguistics abstractions
are based on the illocutionary force of speech
acts (Austin, 1962) and try to capture and model
the communicative intention of human or ma-
chine utterances. In recent years, several dia-
logue systems have made use of DAs for mod-
elling discourse phenomena in either the Dialogue
Manager (Keizer et al, 2008), Automatic Speech
Recogniser (Stolcke et al, 2000) or the Auto-
matic Speech Synthesiser (Zovato and Romportl,
2008). Additionally, they have been used also in
other tasks such as summarisation, (Murray et al,
2006). Therefore, a correct DA classification of di-
alogue turns can bring benefits to the performance
of these modules and tasks.
Many machine learning approaches have been
used to automatically label DAs. They are usu-
ally based on Supervised Learning techniques
involving combinations of Ngrams and Hidden
Markov Models (Stolcke et al, 2000; Mart??nez-
Hinarejos et al, 2008), Neural Networks (Garfield
and Wermter, 2006) or Graphical Models (Ji and
Bilmes, 2005). Relatively few approaches to DA
classification have been based on unsupervised
learning methods. Some promising results were
reported by Anderach et al(Andernach et al,
1997; Andernach, 1996) who applied Kohonen
Self Organising Maps (SOMs) to the problem of
DA classification. Although the SOM is nonpara-
metric in the sense that it doesn?t require that the
number of clusters to be found in the data be a pa-
rameter of the SOM that is specified before clus-
tering begins, it?s capacity to detect clusters is lim-
ited to the size of the two-dimensional lattice onto
which the clusters are projected, and the size of
this lattice is determined prior to clustering. This
paper investigates the use of an unsupervised, non-
parametric Bayesian approach to automatic DA
labelling: namely the Dirichlet Process Mixture
Model (DPMM). Specifically, the paper reports re-
sults from applying the Chinese Restaurant Pro-
cess (CRP), a popular approach to DPMMs, to
the automatic labelling of DAs in the Dihana cor-
pus. The Dihana corpus (J.M.Bened?? et al, 2006)
has previously been used for the same task but
with a supervised learning approach (Mart??nez-
Hinarejos et al, 2008). The results reported here
indicate that, treating each utterance as a bag of
words, the CRP is capable of automatically clus-
341
tering most utterances according to speaker, level
1 and in some cases level 2 DA annotations (see
below).
2 The Dihana corpus
The Dihana corpus consists of human-computer
spoken dialogues in Spanish about queuing infor-
mation of train fares and timetables. The acquisi-
tion was performed using the Wizard of Oz (WoZ)
technique, where a human simulates the system
following a prefixed strategy. User and system
utterances are different in nature, user utterances
are completely spontaneous speech whereas sys-
tem utterances are based on pre-written patterns
that the WoZ selected according to what the user
said in the previous turn, the current dialogue state
and the WoZ strategy. There is a total of 900 dia-
logues with a vocabulary of 823 words. However,
after applying a process of name entity recognition
(cities, times, number, ...) and making the distinc-
tion between system and user words there are 964
different words. The same process of name en-
tity recognition was also used by Martinez Hinare-
jos (Mart??nez-Hinarejos et al, 2008)
2.1 Annotation scheme
Dialogues were manually annotated using a dia-
logue act annotation scheme based on three lev-
els (see Table 1). The first level corresponds to
the general intention of the speaker (speech act),
the second level represents the implicit informa-
tion that is referred to in the first level and the third
level is the specific data provided in the utterance.
Using these three levels and making the distinc-
tion between user and system labels, there are 248
different labels (153 for the user and 95 for the sys-
tem). Combining only first and second level there
are 72 labels (45 for user and 27 for system), and
with only first level there are 16 labels (7 for user
and 9 for system).
Annotation was done at utterance level. That
is, each dialogue turn was divided (segmented)
into utterances such that each one corresponds to a
unique DA label. An example of the segmentation
and annotation of two turns of a dialogue can be
seen in Figure 1

automatic, unsupervised clustering of the utter-
ances in the Dihana corpus. This approach treats
each utterance as a bag of words (i.e. an unordered
collection of words) (Sebastiani, 2002). Utter-
ances are clustered according to the relative counts
of word occurrences that they contain so that utter-
ances with similar histograms of word counts will,
in general, appear in the same cluster.
Bayesian methods for unsupervised data clus-
tering divide into parametric and nonparametric
approaches. Parametric approaches to clustering
such as Finite Bayesian Mixture Models (Mclach-
lan and Peel, 2000) require prior estimation of the
number of clusters that are expected to be found
in the data. However, it is not always possible to
know this in advance and often it is necessary to
repeat a modelling experiment many times over a
range of choices of cluster numbers to find an op-
timal number of clusters. Sub-optimal choices for
the number of clusters can lead to a degradation
in the generalisation performance of the model.
Nonparametric approaches to mixture modelling,
on the other hand, do not require prior estimates
of the number of clusters in the data; this is dis-
covered automatically as the model clusters the
data. Dirichlet Processes offer one approach to de-
veloping Bayesian nonparametric mixture models.
The remainder of this section briefly introduces
DPMMs, beginning with a brief look at finite
Bayesian mixture models which will serve as use-
ful background for presenting the Chinese Restau-
rant Process, the Dirichlet Process paradigm used
in this paper.

3.1 Finite Bayesian Mixture Models
A Dirichlet distribution is defined as a measure
on measures. Specifically, a Dirichlet distribution
defines a probability measure over the k-simplex.
The k-simplex is a convex hull constructed so that
each point on the surface of the simplex describes
a probability distribution over k outcomes:
Qk = {(x1, . . . , xk) : xi ? 0
?i ? {1 . . . k},
k
?
i=1
xi = 1}
Figure 2 shows a 3-simplex with two example
points and the corresponding distributions. The
Dirichlet distribution places a probability measure
over the k-simplex so that certain subsets of points
on the simplex (i.e. certain distributions) have
higher probabilities than others (Figure 3). The
probability measure in the Dirichlet is parame-
terised by a set of positive, non-zero concentra-
tion constants ? = {?1, . . . ?k : ?i > 0}, written
Dirichletk(?1, . . . ?k). The effects of different
values of ? for the 3-simplex are shown in Figure
3.
The probability density function of the Dirichlet

distribution is given by:
Dirichletk(?1, . . . , ?k) = f(x1, . . . , xk;?1, . . . , ?k)
= ?(
?k
i=1 ?i)
?k
i=1 ?(?i)
k
?
i=1
xai?1i
where ?(x) (=
? ?
0 t(x?1)e?tdt) extends the fac-
torial function to the real numbers. Since a
draw from a Dirichlet distribution (written ? ?
Dirichletk(?)) gives a distribution, a Dirichlet
can be used as the prior for a Bayesian finite mix-
ture model:
? ? Dirichletk(?1, . . . , ?k)
? is a distribution over the k components ? of
the finite mixture model. Each component ?zi is
drawn from a base measure G0 (?zi ? G0). The
choice of distribution G0 depends on the nature
of the data to be clustered; with data that is rep-
resented using the bag of words model, G0 must
generate distributions over the word vocabulary.
Hence the Dirichlet distribution is an appropriate
choice in this case:
?zi ? Dirichletv(?1, . . . , ?v)
where v is the size of the vocabulary.
For each data point (utterance) xi a component
?zi is selected by a draw zi from the multinomial
distribution ?:
zi ? Multinomialk(?)
A suitable distribution F (?zi) is then used to draw
the data point (utterance). In the bag of words
model, the multinomial distribution is used to
draw the words for each data point xi:
xi ? Multinomialv(?zi)
A small example will illustrate this generative
process. Imagine that there are just two types
of utterances with a vocabulary consisting sim-
ply of the words A, B and C. A finite Bayesian
mixture model in this case would first draw ?
from a suitable Dirichlet distribution (e.g. ? ?
Dirichlet2(0.5, 1)) as, for example, is shown in
Figure 4(a). Next the two components ?z1 and
?z2 would be drawn from a suitable base distribu-
tion G0 (e.g. ?z1 ? Dirichlet3(1, 0.5, 0.5) and
?z2 ? Dirichlet3(0.5, 0.5, 1), see Figure 4(b)
and 4(c)). In this case, ?z1 will tend to generate
Figure 4: An example finite Bayesian mixture
model. (a) The prior distribution over components
?z1 (b) and ?z2 (c)
utterances containing more occurrences of word
A than B or C, whilst ?z2 will tend to gener-
ate utterances with more C?s than A?s or B?s. A
component zi is then selected for each utterance
(zi ? Multinomialk(?)). Note that in this ex-
ample, the distribution ? would lead to more utter-
ances generated by ?z2 than by ?z1 . Suppose that
five utterances are to be generated by this model
and that the components for each utterance are
z1 = 1, z2 = 2, z3 = 2, z4 = 1 and z5 = 2.
The words in each utterance are then generated
by repeated draws from the corresponding com-
ponent (e.g. x1 = ACAAB, x2 = ACCBCC,
x3 = CCC, x4 = CABAAC and x5 = ACC).
3.2 Dirichlet Processes
A Dirichlet Process can be thought of as an exten-
sion of a Dirichlet distribution where the dimen-
sions of the distribution are infinite. The prob-
lem with the infinite dimension Dirichlet distri-
bution, though, is that its probability mass would
be distributed across the whole of the distribution.
However, in most practical applications of mixture
modelling there will be a finite number of clusters.
The solution is to have a process which will tend
to place most of the probability mass at the be-
ginning of the infinite distribution, thereby mak-
ing it possible to assign probabilities to clusters
without restricting the number of clusters avail-
able. The GEM stick breaking construction (the
name comes from the first letters of Griffiths, En-
gen and McCloskey (Pitman, 2002)) achieves pre-
cisely this (Pitman and Yor, 1997). Starting with
344
a stick of unit length, random portions ??k are re-
peatedly broken off the stick, with each part that
is broken off representing the proportion of prob-
ability assigned to a component:
??k ? Beta(1, ?) ?k =
?k?1
i+1 (1? ??i) ? ??k
The Dirichlet Process mixture model can now
be specified as:
? ?GEM(?) ?zi ?G0 zi ? (1 . . .?)
zi ?Multinomial(?) xi ? F (?zi)
3.3 Chinese Restaurant Process
The Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) is a popu-
lar Dirichlet Process paradigm that has been suc-
cessfully applied to many clustering problems. In
the CRP, one is asked to imagine a Chinese restau-
rant with an infinite number of tables. The cus-
tomers enter the restaurant and select, according to
a given distribution, a table at which to sit. All the
customers on the same table share the same dish.
In this paradigm, the tables represent data clusters,
the customers represent data points (xi) and the
dishes represent components (?z). As each cus-
tomer (data point) enters the restaurant the choice
of which table (cluster) and therefore which dish
(component) is determined by a draw from the fol-
lowing distribution:
?i|?1, . . . , ?i?1 ?
1
(? + i? 1)
?
?
i?1
?
j=1
??j + ?G0
?
?
where ? is the concentration parameter for the
CRP. The summation over the ??j ?s counts the
number of customers sat at each of the occupied
tables. The probability of sitting at an already oc-
cupied table, therefore, is proportional to the num-
ber of customers already sat at the table, whilst the
probability of starting a new table is proportional
to ?G0. Figure 5 illustrates four iterations of this
initial clustering process.
Once all the customers (data points) have been
placed at tables (clusters), the inference process
begins. The posterior p(?,?, z|x) cannot be cal-
culated exactly, but Gibbs sampling can be used.
Gibbs sampling for the CRP involves iteratively
removing a randomly selected customer from their
table, calculating the posterior probability distri-
bution across all the occupied tables together with
a potential new table (with a randomly drawn dish,
Figure 5: The first four steps of the initial cluster-
ing process of the CRP. The probability distribu-
tion over the tables is also shown in each case.
i.e. component), and making a draw from that dis-
tribution to determine the new table for that cus-
tomer. The posterior distribution across the tables
is calculated as follows:
?i|?1, . . . ,?i?1,x
? 1B
?
?
i?1
?
j=1
??jp(xi|?j) + ?G0p(xi|?i)
?
?
where B = ?p(xk) +
?i?1
j=1 p(xi|?i) is the nor-
malising constant. After a predetermined number
of samples, the dish (component) of each occupied
table is updated to further resemble the customers
(data points) sitting around it. In the bag of words
approach used here, this involves converting the
histogram of word counts in each customer (utter-
ance) sitting at the table into an empirical distribu-
tion H(xi), taking the average of these empirical
distributions and modifying the dish (component)
to further resemble this distribution:
?i = ?i +
?
mi
mi
?
j=1
H(xj)
where ? (0 ? ? < 1) is the learning con-
stant and mi is the number of customers around
345
table i. The inference process continues to it-
erate between Gibbs sampling and updating the
table dishes (components) until the process con-
verges. Convergence can be estimated by observ-
ing n consecutive samples in which the customer
was returned to the same table they were taken
from.
4 Results
The CRP with Gibbs sampling was used to clus-
ter both user and system utterances from the 900
dialogues in the Dihana corpus. Each utterance is
treated as an independent bag of words where all
information about the dialogue that it came from
and the context in which it was uttered is ignored
during training. Intra-cluster and inter-cluster sim-
ilarity measures were used to evaluate the resulting
clusters. Intra-cluster similarity S?i is calculated
by averaging the Euclidean distance between ev-
ery pair of data points in the cluster i:
S?i =
1
2mi
mi
?
i=1;j=1
|xi ? xj |
Inter-cluster similarity S?? is calculated by sum-
ming the Euclidean distance between the centroids
of all pairs of clusters:
S?? =
n
?
i=1;j=1
|Ci ? Cj |
where Ci is the centroid of cluster i and n is the
number of clusters.
Two classification error measures were also
used, one from the cluster (table) perspective E?,
and the other from the perspective of the Dialogue
Act (DA) annotations (first level) of the Dihana
corpus E??. The cluster classification error of ta-
ble i is calculated by summing up the occurrences
of each DA on the table, finding the DA with the
largest total and allocating that DA as the correct
classification for that table Di. The number of
false positives fpi for that table is the count of all
customers (utterances) with DA annotations not in
Di. The number of false negatives fni is the count
of utterances with label Di that occur on other ta-
bles. The cluster classification error for table i is
therefore:
E?i =
1
n(f
p
i + fni )
The DA classification error E??i measures how
well DA i has been clustered, using the size of the

of clusters discovered by the CRP would be 72. It
should also be noted that given an initial random
clustering, a good clustering algorithm will reduce
intra-cluster similarity (S??), increase inter-cluster
similarity (S??) and reduce the classification errors
(E?? and E???).

5 Discussion
The first row of the table in Figure 6 shows the
cluster similarity measures and classification er-
rors after 0 epochs of the inference procedure (i.e.
for a random clustering of utterances). This gives a
baseline for the measures and error values used in
subsequent runs. The second row of values shows
the results after a run of 1000K epochs of the in-
ference procedure. This run finds only 44 clusters
but has a much lower value for S?? than was found
in the random clustering, showing a significant in-
crease in the similarity between utterances within
each cluster. Surprisingly, the value for S?? is also
reduced, showing that the differentiation between
the clusters formed at this stage is even lower than
there was with the random clustering. E?? and E???
show suitable reductions indicating that the classi-
fication errors are being reduced by the inference
process. The third row of values show that after
1500K epochs 54 clusters have been found, intra-
cluster similarity is increased beyond that for the
random clustering, but the classification errors re-
main essentially the same as for the 1500K run.
Although the 1500K epoch run found only 54
clusters, it was able to clearly distinguish between
system and user utterances: with 30 clusters con-
taining system utterances only, 22 clusters con-
taining user utterances only and 2 clusters contain-
ing instances of both. Given that the system utter-
ances in the Dihana corpus are generated from a
restricted set of sentences, it is not surprising that
these were easy to cluster and differentiate from
user utterances. However, the CRP was also able
to cluster user utterances well, which is more of
a challenge. Table 2 shows the clusters that have
specialised on user utterances, with the counts of
the level 1 annotations in each case. The largest
cluster for each level 1 annotation is shown in bold
typeface. From here it can be seen that cluster 15
has specialised on bothClosing and Rejection. It is
not surprising that these fall within the same clus-
ter since the words used in each are often the same
(e.g. ?No thank you? can act as either a closing
statement or a rejection statement). Clusters 14,
22, 29, 28 and 41 have specialised to the Answer-
ing annotation, whilst clusters 4, 12 49, 51 and 53
have specialised to Asking. Table 3 shows how
each of these clusters have specialised to level 2
annotations. Cluster 14, for example, specialises
on the Answering:Day pair, whilst 22 specialises
on Answering:Destination pair.
These initial results show that, at least for the
Dihana corpus, the DPMM can successfully clus-
ter utterances into Speaker, Level 1, and Level2
classes. Whilst this looks promising, it must be
acknowledged that the Dihana corpus is restricted
to train service inquiries and it remains unclear
whether this approach will generalise to other di-
alogue corpora with a broader range of topics and
wider vocabularies. Future work will include in-
vestigating the use of ngrams of words, syntactic
features, the DAs of previous utterances and ex-
perimentation with other corpora such as Switch-
board (Godfrey et al, 1992).
