Abstract 
This paper describes the work achieved in 
the Concerted Research Project ARC A3 
supported and coordinated by the AUF1, 
former Aupelf-Uref2. The project deals 
with the evaluation of term and semantic 
relation extraction from corpora in French. 
Eight participants, both from public 
institutions and industrial corporations 
were involved in this project and were 
responsible for producing corpora suitable 
for extraction tasks and elaborating a 
protocol in order to evaluate objectively 
terminology acquisition tools. This 
expression covers respectively, term 
extractors, classifiers and semantic relation 
extractors. The paper also reports on the 
methodology used for comparing four term 
extractors, one classifier and three 
semantic relation extractors during the 
2000 evaluation campaign. There are also 
several by-products of this campaign: first, 
two corpora which can be used for NLP 
system development and evaluation as the 
AUF recommended; and then terminology 
products: for each corpus a list of terms 
characterizing the field is available. We are 
not giving details about the results but 
rather an assessment of what the evaluation 
of Terminology Extraction Tools is: how 
was it done, what were the difficulties, 
which are the advantages and 
disadvantages of the adopted protocol, 
what are the limits and how should we 
proceed for future testing.

1 The ARC A3 Program 
ARC A3 is a project of the ILEC3 group 
coordinated and founded by AUF. It was started 
in 1995 in order to promote research in the field 
of terminology acquisition. The ARC A3, 
?Term and Semantic Relation Extraction from 
Corpora in French? project aim is to test 
software capabilities in term and semantic 
relation extraction from corpora in French. 
Systems submitted to this evaluation are 
designed by French and Canadian research 
institutions (National Scientific Research Center 
and Universities) and/or private businesses. 
These systems have been extensively described 
in our previous work (cf. B?guin, et al, 1997, 
2000; Jouis et al, 1997; Mustafa El Hadi et al, 
1996a, 1996b, 1997 & 1998;). The first phase of 
the project has been directed towards testing the 
systems on one corpus4 (trial run) and towards 
elaborating a workable protocol based on this 
experience. The first results were presented 
during the first conference of JST5 (cf. B?guin et 
al., 1997, 2000). This article reports on the 
second and final evaluation campaign. 
2 ARC A3 Organization 
ARC A3 brings together four kinds of actors: a 
coordinator who plays an organizational role 
(schedule, quality control of corpora, data 
production, etc.), corpora providers; participants 
of the test and two scientific advisors. The 
action has been coordinated by the University of 
Lille 3. The organizing team in cooperation with 
the discussion group made up of representatives 
of each participating team and two scientific

 advisors are supposed to co-operate in defining a 
methodology for testing the systems. 
2.1 Participating Systems 
The systems are designed by French and 
Canadian research institutions. There were ten 
registered participants at the beginning of the 
project and three withdrew later for a variety of 
reasons. The organizers then launched another 
call for participation in July 1999 and three 
more participants joined the project (two private 
enterprises (Xerox and Logos) and a public 
institution (the University of Grenoble). Logos 
and the University team later dropped out for 
reasons unrelated to the program. When the final 
campaign was launched in 2000 there were eight 
systems remaining under evaluation.

2.2 Overview of the Tested Tools 
Terminology plays a major role in information 
processing and management and in specialized 
communication. Its role has been enhanced by 
the spread of automation and by the availability 
of electronic corpora. These two factors have 
had a massive impact on many different 
applications: systematic terminology7 building, 
natural-language interface design, lexical units 
management for specific use in some sub-

languages and technical writing, thesaurus 
construction, translation and indexing as well as 
the recent growth of cross-language information 
retrieval (CLIR). 
If we focus on the tools, presented in our 
evaluation project, from the point of view of 
their functions and of the purposes for which 
they were designed), there are three categories: 
"Term Extractors", "Classifying Tools", and 
"Semantic relations extraction tools". As we 
already mentioned, these systems were 
extensively described in our previous 
publications. 
2.2.1 Term Extractors (TE) 
We will briefly describe the basic idea 
underlying TE tools. Most of the extracting tools 
consider terms as noun phrases. Systems 
identify terms by using frequency, distribution 
and category-pattern matching (Daille et al 
1995; Dagan, 1996; Lauriston, 1994). All lexical 
units contained in a given text are analyzed and 
matched to patterns (typical forms of 
terminological units) described in rules. More 
term extractors are accounted for elsewhere 
(L'Homme, 1996; Kageura et al, 1996; Dagan 
et al, 1994). Some of the systems described by 
these authors are tested in the framework of our 
valuation project (Acabit, Lexter, and Ana). 
2.2.2 Classifiers and Semantic Relation 
Extractors (SRE) 
Terminology resources are increasingly seen as 
structured data i.e. as a network of terms 
organized by relations. Pure alphabetical lists 
can hardly be used except for bilingual reference 
tools. The variety of tools, their functions and 
the different possible uses offered within the 
framework of ARC A3 shows this need. 
Consequently such lists of terms are quite 
difficult to evaluate except by specialists in the 
relevant fields which makes it a rather 
constraining process. 
Structuring terms by semantic relations or in 
classes is useful for the following applications: 
Index-making for on-line technical 
documentation; browsing; information access 
and retrieval; building thesaurus and ontologies 
for information systems. 
Many applications and extraction methods 
relevant to these tools have been described in 
the literature. The systems tested in the AUF 
framework are geared towards a variety of 
 applications ranging from rough semantic 
relation extraction, through indexing, thesaurus 
construction to knowledge-based system 
modeling (see figure 2). 
Classifiers and semantic relation extractors are 
tested within the same framework as the one 
used for evaluating term extractors. The first 
category is characterized as classifying tools. 
Their role is to build classes of networks of 
terms linked to a major one. This category 
consists of statistical and/or connectionist 
models such as Conterm. It is the only classifier 
tested within the framework of this campaign. 
The second category includes semantic relation 
extractors which focus particularly on semantic 
relations (Iota, Loria and Seek-Java). A 
complete description of all the systems which 
were tested (main characteristics and purposes, 
description as far as approaches are concerned) 
is documented in previous work. 
3 Evaluation paradigm 
Evaluation activities are a corollary of the quick 
development of NLP tools in general and of 
terminology extraction in particular. It thus 
became necessary to evaluate these tools on 
objectively based criteria in order to have a clear 
picture of the state-of-the-art, assess the needs in 
this sector and hence promote research in this 
specific field. Moreover, the principal aim of 
existing testing methods, as reported in the 
literature, is to come across software errors and 
then try to adapt them for a particular user 
environment. 
Evaluation paradigm is basically dependant 
upon two major steps: (i) Creation of textual 
data: raw or tagged corpora and test material. A 
corpus-based research is part of the 
infrastructure for the development of advanced 
language processing applications; (ii) Test and 
comparison of systems on a similar data 
(Cavazza, 1993; Adda et al, 2000). 
3.1 The ARC A3 Evaluation Approach 
The approach we adopted is a black-box 
qualitative approach8 The results are compared

 This approach is adopted and validated by the vast 
majority of participants to the test in June 1999. The 
organizers have slightly adapted the protocol because more 
participants joined the ARC after the validation of the 
protocol. 
with the human performance of a task (either 
experts examining results or using reference lists 
or both). Moreover comparisons are made with 
other systems performing the same task. The 
results are finally calculated and translated in 
terms of traditional IR measures9. 
The conventional distinction between black-box 
and glass-box is the following: the former 
considers only system input-out-put relations 
without regard to the specific mechanisms by 
which the outputs were obtained while the latter 
examines the mechanisms linking input and 
output. (Sparck-Jones, 1996 p. 26; King, 1996; 
1999, among many others). 
The qualitative evaluation measures as described 
by Sparck-Jones 1996, pp. 61-122, are based on 
observation or interviewing and are broadly 
designed to obtain a more holistic, less reductive 
or fragmented view of the situation. It is 
moreover more naturalistic. This type of 
evaluation naturally fits an end-free style. In our 
case the quality of the results is evaluated by 
domain experts. We distinguish two types of 
experts: experts for the three applications tested 
(systematic terminology, translation and 
indexing); and experts in the two domains of 
corpora (biotechnology and pedagogy). 
Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are 
goal-oriented, that is focusing on discrepancies 
between performance results and initial system 
requirements. Sparck-Jones points out how the 
two types of measures are deeply interwoven 
although different in their nature: 
- Recall is a quantitative measure of system 
performance while 
- Declared Satisfaction is a qualitative one (i.e. 
such a measure is really qualitative even if the 
result of applying it to a set of users is a 
percentage figure). 
The qualitative approach in the evaluation 
process is the easiest one for end users. It means 
giving a value judgment on how the system 
globally works (Cavazza, 1993; Chaudiron, 
2000). The dominant approach today is towards 
quantitative evaluations which are considered as 
more objective and reproducible than the 
qualitative approach (EAGLES-1 1996; ISLE 
2001). The main attempt of these approaches is

 We chose to accompany the qualitative approach (mainly 
based on manual evaluations) by a translation of the 
manual evaluations into numerical scales of values (see 
below for more details). 
 to translate the concepts of relevance and quality 
into numerical data. Statistical approaches such 
as MUC 2 and TREC 3 are frequently used for 
this type of evaluation. (Chaudiron, 2000). 
3.1.1 The merits of a black-box evaluation 
Obviously this approach has its pros and cons. 
But it can be justified on the following basis: 
- Since most developers cannot provide us (as 
test organizers) with their systems, the only way 
was to send them the text corpora and let them 
provide us with the results. A glass-box 
evaluation would have required an examination 
of the systems by the organizers which would 
have been impossible except for Xerox?s 
TermFinder and Logos System?s Knowledge 
Discovery, two commercialized systems. 
- Even if this approach may be criticized on 
account of its subjective side, end-users like it 
because of its usefulness when comparing two 
or more systems which differ in all their 
parameter settings. (Chaudiron 2000; Cavazza 
1993). 
- A black-box evaluation is more oriented 
towards system?s end-user when compared to a 
glass-box evaluation. For the latter the test will 
involve analyzing the system?s functioning by 
looking at its different components. Each 
component is evaluated separately in itself. Such 
an approach allows for spotting and 
understanding the causes of dysfunctional 
results. It is a long term process which requires 
access to the internal parts of the system and an 
understanding of the architecture and global 
strategy of the software. This is obviously a 
developer oriented approach and not an end-
user one (Chaudiron 2000; Cavazza 1993). 
- In spite of its limited scope the evaluation 
protocol we adopted is used in more 
complicated NLP tools, such as MT tools. 
Evaluators examine the systems? output without 
considering the differences between them (cf. 
L?Homme, 2001). Last Spring our team took 
part in a workshop organized by ISSCO 
(University of Geneva) where we and all the 
other participants adopted this approach. 
 
3.2 Elements of the Evaluation Protocol of 
the 2000 Campaign 
3.2.1 Evaluation Task 
The extraction of terms, of classes and of 
semantic relations was necessary to test the tools 
performance in the three following tasks: 
Systematic terminology (characterizing the 
tested corpora); (ii) Translation; (iii) Indexing. 
This means in practice: what is the relevance of 
terms, classes and semantic relations provided 
by the systems being tested? Do the terms, 
classes and semantic relations satisfy minimum 
requirements? Do we need to define a minimum 
level of terms, classes, semantic production? 
Are discrepancies meaningful? For example, it 
could be that most of the systems being tested 
are having qualitatively poor outputs, while only 
one or two produce worthwhile results. Within 
this perspective the idea was to submit the 
results to specialists. We distinguished for the 
purpose of this campaign two types of human 
expertise as we mentioned above. 
3.2.2 Test material 
Evaluation data can normally be divided into 
two different categories (i) representative 
samples of the tested corpora (ii) test material, 
which, in our evaluation framework, is made up 
of both custom-designed lists and real life lists / 
thesaurus. 
3.2.2.1 Corpus 
Two corpora were tested: Spirale10 and INRA11. 
We have chosen a sample representing 10% of 
each corpus: for Spirale n? 19 was chosen. As 
for INRA corpus, the providers of this corpus 
suggested 8 articles (603, 604, 607, 609, 631, 
666, 732, 740). 
3.2.2.2 Reference Lists 
These lists are standard human professional 
results which can be used as performance 
exemplars or norms for comparison. This type 
of data is considered to be a gold standard (see 
SensEval, Kilgarrif 1998; ISLE 2001). 
For the INRA corpus the following lists have 
been created: 
For translation two lists were processed (i) a list 
created by a novice translator (ii) another one by 
a confirmed professional translator.

 423 texts, 16 mega bytes  
11
 51 texts, 2,2 mega bytes. 
 For indexing: six lists were created both by 
professional and by non professional indexers. 
We are not developing these lists in this paper 
given the limited scope of this type of evaluation 
from an indexing point of view. Hence the 
limited interest of term extraction tools for 
human indexing. We will however comment on 
the terminology lists provided by the two corpus 
providers, INRA (Institut National pour la 
Recherche Agronomique i.e. National Institute 
for Agronomic Research), the Francis list of 
INIST12) and the translation lists. 
As far as INRA corpus is concerned: 
We think that our evaluation task could have 
given better results if the lists had been more 
representative of a systematic terminology 
activity. For the INRA corpora, for example, 
only 113 terms were chosen by the experts to 
represent their terminology. Our estimation is 
that, 113 terms only constitute a poor 
representation of an activity. It would have been 
a good idea to have specialists establish the lists 
of terms and to compare those to the systems? 
output. Even if this work is time consuming it 
makes for a better evaluation of the systems? 
productivity. As far as indexing is concerned the 
interest of these lists is quite limited and we 
think that a lot of time has been lost in drawing 
them up and even grooming them. From a 
general point of view the tools we have 
considered, especially term extraction ones, only 
have a limited interest for indexing contrary to 
other tools (semantic relation extractors) they 
have not been conceived for this purpose. This 
point of view is shared by their own designers. 
However, some of the semantic extraction tools 
are adapted for indexing among their other 
applications (Iota and Loria, for instance). 
As for Spirale corpus: 
Terminology (i) Thesaurus Mobis, (educational 
sciences section) (ii) Francis list (of the INIST, 
covering the complete volume on educational 
sciences section). 
Three lists for indexing: - Dictionnaire 
encyclop?dique de l'?ducation et de la 
formation13. - CRDP list14 de Lille. - Br?hier list 
(PRCE in documentation ).

Technical Information. The list they provided is used to

3.2.2.3 Unified Presentation Format 
The protocol we suggested was based on the 
previous evaluation sessions. The layout of 
some results could at times make the task of 
evaluation difficult. In some cases, good graphic 
presentation (conceptual graphs, etc.) could hide 
a poor term extraction and hence influence the 
evaluation. Conversely a system which has the 
capacity to extract relevant terms and semantic 
relations but whose layout is poor can influence 
the evaluation process. To prevent this, 
participants have been asked to adopt a unified 
format for their presentations for 2000 
evaluation campaign. 
3.2.2.4. Non-unified Tagging 
Given the fact that system designers have 
different processing possibilities, some of the 
systems use an independent tagger, others have 
an integrated one which is part and parcel of 
their system. The organizers decided to allow 
the participants their own choice in terms of 
tagging methods. 
3.2.2.5. Evaluation Measures 
Given the three tasks to be performed (indexing, 
systematic terminology and translation), the 
usual notions of recall and precision can be used 
to evaluate the quality of results when matched 
with a manually-produced reference list. 
Performance failure at this level can be 
interpreted in terms of silence and noise (see 
below). 
3.2.2.6. Automatic Matching by EvalTerm 
If the qualitative approach offers the easiest 
form of systems evaluation it nevertheless 
retains two major drawbacks: (i) it makes up for 
a very boring job when there are too many 
results (ii) judgments can easily be slanted by 
the subjective approach of the expert. 
Our protocol being based on the qualitative 
black-box principle where parameters are hard 
to quantify we chose to apply traditional IR 
measures, recall and precision which normally 
accompany qualitative evaluations: 
R = number of correct extractions / number of 
reference extractions. 
P = number of correct extractions / number of 
proposed extractions15 
Since the manual matching of lists proved to be 
long and complicated due to the huge size of the 
                                                          
15
 Or their equivalents in terms of noise and silence: 
Silence = 1 ? Recall, Noise = 1 ? Precision  
 processed data and to a variety of other 
inconveniences, we chose to automatically 
calculate these measures. We then decided to 
duplicate the manual evaluation with its 
conversion into numerical scales of values.  
For this purpose we developed a program which 
matches the results provided by the software 
with the reference lists16 The program compares 
two lists: L1 represents the results given by a 
software and list L2 is a reference list proposed 
by an expert17. The program output consists of 
two files: file (a)
 
which contains the elements of 
L2 found in L1 (the relevant terms which the 
software was able to find). And file (b) which 
contains some elements of L2 which have not 
been identified and consequently were not 
mentioned in L1 (the correct terms not found by 
the software). Through a simple subtraction we 
can get a file containing the noisy terms of each 
software. 
In our automatic matching we have not included 
any linguistic treatment for fear of introducing 
new parameters which would influence the 
results. Right from the beginning we have 
noticed that over-productive systems such as 
Ana or Term Finder are difficult to compare 
with reference lists because the noise rate 
becomes irrelevant. 
4 An Overview of the Results 
4.1 Term Extraction on the two Corpora 
We will now comment globally on how the term 
extractors performed when run on the two 
corpora for the three different tasks (indexing, 
systematic terminology and translation): 
First, automatic matching concurred with human 
experience which notices that the systems 
produce many ? noisy ? terms while on the 
contrary there are many terms not included in 
the reference lists but which the experts 
considered as relevant for systematic 
terminology. Hence the interest of some of these 
? noisy ? terms for enriching and updating 
reference lists and terminology data bases. 
Matching the results of the different systems has 
                                                          
16These lists can be: a) existing lists, real-life lists ( thesauri 
or alphabetical lists, such as Francis List);  b) established 
by the evaluators/indexers (specifically tailored for the 
three tasks, indexing, terminology and translation). 
17
 They are many lists proposed by our experts. 
showed a great similarity between Lexter and 
Acabit. 
As for indexing, if the systems could generally 
provide relevant and effective help for 
terminology (systematic terminology, and 
translation) their contribution to indexing is less 
obvious. Indexing supposes other mental 
operations than those needed for terminology 
construction and simply picking out candidate-
descriptors is not enough to supply a reliable 
form of indexing. 
The three core criteria of good indexing are: 
reliability, selectivity and exhaustiveness. The 
indexer must hold a balance between 
exhaustiveness and selectivity. Having too many 
terms leads to noise and too few to silence. It is 
on this criteria of selectivity that human 
processing varies. 
Softwares based on term extraction offer a large 
number of potential candidate terms, connecting 
them with more or less precise criteria of 
relevance, mostly of a statistical nature. At this 
level of processing the indexer has recourse to 
authorized lists and thesauri i.e. he or she refers 
to the work of terminologists in structuring the 
field and attributing a label to each and every 
concept. The systems which we tried to assess 
are not yet likely to provide a very effective help 
to indexing since the results are over-productive 
in view of the needs. 
5 The Classifier and the Semantic Relation 
Extraction (SRE) Tools 
The protocol we adopted specifies the 
evaluation of semantic relation and class 
validity, coherence and comprehensiveness on 
all of the three tasks (i.e. semantic relations 
examined from the point of view of systematic 
terminology, translation and indexing). The 
classes and semantic relations extracted were 
subject to a comparison with the human 
performance of these tasks (experts and 
reference lists), plus a comparison with other 
systems performing the same task. This 
qualitative evaluation is measured by the 
traditional IR performance measures (silence, 
noise, recall and precision). The first thing we 
can remark on is that it is very difficult to fulfill 
the evaluation within our proposed terms of 
reference. We are presenting hereunder the 
reasons limiting the scope of our protocol when 
applied to SRE results. 
 5.1 An Overview of the Results of SRE on 
the Two Corpora 
What we observed is that these tools are too 
different to allow a useful comparison for the 
following reasons: 
- SRE extract different types of relations and 
hence are incomparable. 
- This difference is linked to the different forms 
of semantic model implementation. Conversely 
some extractors are based on models that will 
not allow the type of relations required for the 
three evaluation tasks. 
- SRE are designed for different functions and 
have different objectives or carry out different 
tasks. 
- These differences are reflected in the type of 
output or results. 
- Another problem came from the fact that 
INRA could not provide us with a structured list 
corresponding to the eight selected texts. Even if 
this list had been available, comparing it to the 
results would have been of limited interest only. 
The remaining solution was to submit the results 
to a field specialist. 
- Difficulties in interpreting the non-labeled 
Semantic Relations. Fig. Two shows these 
differences:

measure silence using a protocol based on IR 
systems performance measure. 
? Without a prior knowledge of the missing 
possible relations one cannot account for the 
silence measure. 
? To account for noise, a thorough knowledge 
of both the semantic model and the field of 
knowledge is required. 
? These observation are also valid for recall 
and precision measures. 
We can thus say for the time being that SRE 
cannot be assessed by the protocol since their 
results cannot be matched. 
The field specialist18 gave the following account: 
?It is essential to have an interface to manipulate 
and interpret the relations. Everything seemed 
somewhat inconclusive. At times the relation 
?fits well?, at times it does not at all. Results are 
not always relevant and it is difficult to trust this 
type of analysis on its own if one is not at the 
same time be conversant with the domain, since 
some of the relations can be wrong. 
For Iota, concept extraction seems generally 
quite relevant. However one has to wonder 
about the relevance of a number of extracted 
concepts which are not at all relevant to the 
field. How did these non-specific concepts get 
extracted more easily than others ? 
As for the table on Conceptual Semantic 
Dependence19 it is hard to draw any conclusions 
from it since it offers only one semantic label for 
any relation. 
The Iota approach is more global than the Seek-
Java one since the relations are based on the 
whole document and not only at the level of one 
sentence. These two softwares are thus difficult 
to compare since their purpose is not the same?. 
5.2 Conterm, the Classifier: an ad hoc 
Evaluation 
Given the difficulties we listed above and the 
fact that it was impossible to compare Conterm 
with other systems performing the same task. 
The only possible evaluation for Conterm would 
have been a progress evaluation for this sole 
classifier of the campaign20. This problem shows 
again the limits of our Protocol. The Conterm 
lists were matched to an automatically produced

 The protocol is not suitable for its evaluation. After the 
withdrawal of another participant who had also presented a 
classifier, only this one remained. 
 untagged list of terms which corresponds to the 
eight texts of the INRA corpus. The most 
important element in its evaluation is not that we 
matched its results with a tagged list but that the 
results had been matched with indexers? and/or 
experts lists and that we could observe the 
correspondence between Conterm?s output and 
the lists. It does not mean that Conterm is good 
for indexing but that the classes suggested by 
this tool embody conceptual attributes which are 
close to the logic underlying the human 
selection of candidate-terms suitable for 
indexing, namely its rich lexico-semantic 
network. 
6 Concluding Remarks 
- This evaluating action provided us with an 
awareness of the State-of-the-art in the field of 
terminology acquisition tools. It also allowed us 
to test evaluation paradigms, demonstrating how 
difficult it was to apply a single evaluation 
protocol to a variety of systems operating along 
different lines. 
- The discussions among participants aiming at 
the creation of a testing protocol resulted in the 
definition of an evaluation procedure and in an 
assessment of their relative merits. The 
comparative study of the systems? out-put also 
enabled a better understanding of the 
performances of the wide range of techniques 
involved. As by-products of the project two 
corpora can be used in further evaluation 
campaigns and a set of material tests (real-life 
and constructed or specifically tailored one that 
can be shared during future evaluations). 
- The evaluation results can be used predictively 
for system design, development or modification 
The limits of our evaluation approach can be 
sketched in the following manner: 
- If the adopted protocol based upon reference 
list can be applicable to the two tasks 
(translation and terminology) it is hardly 
applicable to indexing tasks. 
- It is not adequate to account neither for the 
classifiers nor for the SRE. 
- Several questions remain unanswered: 
a) first, is it possible to fully automate 
evaluation procedures? Then is it possible to 
abandon test material, such as reference lists or 
other type of human-made data, which are 
considered as a kind of gold standard reusable 
for other evaluation campaigns? (see our recent 
experience in MT evaluation workshop, April 
200121. 
b) As far as semantic relation extraction is 
concerned, is it possible to automate SRE 
valuation procedure in the way Grefensttete 
(1994) does? 
7 Future Directions 
1. Exploiting Results: the Campaign?s Side 
Benefits: 
Full treatment of the Spirale corpus will allow 
the creation of an index of all the reviews past 
numbers, which fulfills  the moral contract made 
with its Editorial Board in exchange for getting 
the corpus free of charge. In addition, these 
results can help broaden the terminological 
repository for the education sciences, especially 
in drawing up the Francis Thesaurus which 
covers all education sciences. 
2. Towards Trans-Systemic Integration: The 
output of the systems are divergent but can in 
some cases be complementary. In fact the 
preliminary results drawn from the first 
evaluation in 1997 (cf. B?guin et al 2000) have 
led us to consider the feasibility of trans-
systemic integration for strengthening their 
automatic terms identification capabilities. The 
idea is to combine two or three different types of 
systems in order to specify various integrated 
production processes. Systems could

 ?Setting a methodology for Machine Translation 
evaluation?. The context: evaluation of a translation 
made by an MT System on the following source text: 
INRA corpus text N?604 ? corpus biotechnologique 
sur la reproduction chez l?animal ? Source language: 
French - Target language: English. We carried  out 
some manual testing but with the objective of setting 
a rough methodology that might be irrelevant for 
translating huge size corpora. The tool we used was a 
non interactive French / English MT System with a 
basic French/English dictionary that does not include 
any specific terminology. We had two indexes (a 
French index and an English index of domain 
specific expressions, but they are not aligned). They 
have been provided by the INRA and considered as 
gold standard. We used the indexes to create a 
specific dictionary in order to feed the MT systems 
with this specific lexical data. The next step is to 
assess the impact of specific terminology when 
integrated to an MT system by comparing the results 
of the two translations we get: with and without 
specific terminology. 
 increasingly be seen as parts of these integrated 
production processes. 
3. Towards User-Oriented Evaluations: in the 
light of the results obtained in this campaign the 
most suitable type of evaluation would be a 
user-oriented one. Other types of approaches22 
can be designed, such as adequacy evaluation23 
which can to some extent be adopted for our 
case but we have to define a more strict user 
profile. 
4. Towards developing interfaces for validating 
the results: even if we opted for a unified 
presentation format for the reasons mentioned in 
section 3.2.2.3, we however think it is essential  
for future campaign organizers to have an 
interface to manipulate and interpret the results 
(validating term, relations and classes). This 
type of interface can dramatically facilitate the 
interaction with the evaluators and the end-user 
of these tools. 
5. Designing tools for generic bi-lingual 
production, allowing ad hoc extractions through 
ad hoc interfaces. 
6. Capability to share resources in the future 
(test material such as gold standard lists, real-
life and/or constructed ones). 
7. Developing automatic evaluation tools such 
as Evalterm which can be reused in similar 
future evaluations. 
8. Hypothesis are still to be tested for semantic 
relations extraction: results of the various 
semantic extractors will be of different quality 
depending on the type and nature of corpora 
(domain and genre) chosen (cf. also Condamines 
et al 98; Davidson et al98, among many 
others).

 Spark-Jones et al 1996; King 1999, among many others, 
identified more three types of evaluation processes: the 
progress evaluation,  the adequacy evaluation and the 
diagnostic evaluation. The first and second types are used 
for comparative benchmarking. 
23
 Adequacy evaluation aims at finding out whether a 
system or product is adequate to someone?s needs. This 
type is typically done when thinking of acquiring a system.
