Abstract 
This position paper argues for an interactive 
approach to text understanding. The proposed 
model extends an existing semantics-based 
text authoring system by using the input text 
as a source of information to assist the user in 
re-authoring its content. The approach per-
mits a reliable deep semantic analysis by 
combining automatic information extraction 
with a minimal amount of human interven-
tion. 
1 Introduction 
Answering emails sent to a company by its cus-
tomers ? to take just one example among many 
similar text-processing tasks ? requires a reli-
able understanding of the content of incoming 
messages. This understanding can currently only 
be done by humans, and represents the main bot-
tleneck to a complete automation of the process-
ing chain: other aspects could be delegated to 
such procedures as database requests and text 
generation. Current technology in natural lan-
guage understanding or in information extraction 
is not at a stage where the understanding task can 
be accomplished reliably without human inter-
vention.  
In this paper, which aims at proposing a fresh 
outlook on the problem of text understanding 
rather than at describing a completed implemen-
tation, we advocate an interactive approach 
where:  
1. The building of the semantic representation 
is under the control of a human author;  
2. In order to build the semantic representa-
tion, the author interacts with an intuitive textual 
interface to that representation (obtained from it 
through an NLG process), where some ?active? 
regions of the text are associated with menus that 
display a number of semantic choices for incre-
menting the representation;  
3. The raw input text to be analyzed serves as 
a source of information to the authoring system 
and permits to associate likelihood levels with 
the various authoring choices; in each menu the 
choices are then ranked according to their likeli-
hood, allowing a speedier selection by the au-
thor; when the likelihood of a choice exceeds a 
certain threshold, this choice is performed auto-
matically by the system (but in a way that re-
mains revisable by the author).  
4. The system acts as a flexible understanding 
aid to the human operator: by tuning the thresh-
old at a low level, it can be used as a purely 
automatic, but somewhat unreliable, information 
extraction or understanding system; by tuning the 
threshold higher, it can be used as a powerful 
interactive guide to building a semantic interpre-
tation, with the advantage of a plain textual inter-
face to that representation that is easily 
accessible to general users. 
The paper is organized as follows. In section 
2, we present a document authoring system, 
MDA,  where the author constructs an internal 
semantic representation, but interacts with a tex-
tual realization of that representation. In section 
3, we explain how such a system may be ex-
tended into an Interactive Text Understanding 
(ITU) aid. A raw input document acts as an in-
formation source that serves to rank the choices 
proposed to the author according to their likeli-
hood of ?accounting? for information present in 
the input document. In section 4, we present cur-
rent work on using MDA for legacy-document 
normalization and show that this work can pro-
vide a first approach to an ITU implementation. 
In section 5, we indicate some links between 
these ideas and current work on interactive statis-
tical MT (TransType), showing directions to-
wards more efficient implementations of ITU. 
2 MDA: A semantics-based document au-
thoring system 
The MDA (Multilingual Document Authoring) 
system [Brun et al2000] is an instance (de-
scended from Ranta?s Grammatical Framework 
[Ranta 2002]) of a text-mediated interactive 
natural language generation system, a notion in-
troduced by [Power and Scott 1998] under the 
name of WYSIWYM. In such systems, an author 
gradually constructs a semantic representation, 
but rather than accessing the evolving representa-
tion directly, she actually interacts with a natural 
language text generated from the representation; 
some regions of the text are active, and corre-
spond to still unspecified parts of the representa-
tion; they are associated with menus presenting 
collections of choices for extending the semantic 
representation; the choices are semantically ex-
plicit and the resulting representation contains no 
ambiguities. The author thus has the feeling of 
only interacting with text, while in fact she is 
building a formal semantic object. One applica-
tion of this approach is in multilingual authoring: 
the author interacts with a text in her own lan-
guage, but the internal representation can be used 
to generate reliable translations in other lan-
guages. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the MDA 
architecture and Fig. 2 is a screenshot of the 
MDA interface.

an enumerable collection of well-formed partial semantic 
structures, from which an output text containing active re-
gions is generated, with which the author interacts.

ing of drug leaflets.  
3 Interactive Text Understanding 
In the current MDA system, menu choices are 
ordered statically once and for all in the semantic 
grammar1. However, consider the situation of an 
author producing a certain text while using some 
input document as an informal reference source. 
It would be quite natural to assume that the au-
thoring system could use this document as a 
source of information in order to prime some of 
the menu choices.  
 
Thus, when authoring the description of a phar-
maceutical drug, the presence in the input docu-
ment of the words tablet and solution could serve 
to highlight corresponding choices in the menu 
corresponding to the pharmaceutical form of the 
drug. This would be relatively simple to do, but 
one could go further: rank menu choices and as-
sign them confidence weights according to tex-
tual and contextual hints found in the input 
document. When the confidence is sufficiently 
high, the choice could then be performed auto-
matically by the authoring system, which would 
produce a new portion of the output text, with the 
author retaining the ability of accepting or reject-
ing the system?s suggestion. In case the confi-
dence is not high enough, the author?s choice 
would still be sped up through displaying the 
most likely choices on top of the menu list.

This kind of functionality is what we call a text-
mediated interactive text understanding system, 
or for short, an ITU system (see Fig. 3).2

 While the order between choices listed in a menu does not 
vary, certain choices may be filtered out depending on the 
current authoring context; this mechanism relies on unifica-
tion constraints in the semantic grammar.

  Note that we do not demand that the semantic representa-
tion built with an ITU system be a complete representation 
of the input document, rather it can be a structured descrip-
tion of some thematic aspects of that document. Similarly, it 
is OK for the input document not to contain enough infor-
mation permitting the system or even the author to ?answer? 
certain menus: then some active regions of the output text 
remain unspecified. 
We will now consider some directions to im-
plement an ITU system.  
4 From document normalization to ITU 
A first route towards achieving an ITU system is 
through an extension of ongoing work on docu-
ment normalization [Max and Dymetman 2002, 
Max 2003]. The departure point is the following. 
Assume an MDA system is available for author-
ing a certain type of documents (for instance a 
certain class of drug leaflets), and suppose one is 
presented a ?legacy? document of the same type, 
that is, a document containing the same type of 
information, but produced independently of the 
MDA system; using the system, a human could 
attempt to ?re-author? the content of the input 
legacy document, thus obtaining a normalized 
version of it, as well as an associated semantic 
representation. 
An attempt to automate the re-authoring proc-
ess works as follows. Consider the virtual space 
of semantic representations enumerated by the 
MDA grammar. For each such representation, 
produce, through the standard MDA realization 
process3 a certain more or less rough ?descriptor? 
of what the input text should contain if its con-
tent should correspond to that semantic represen-
tation; then define a similarity measure between 
this descriptor and the input text; finally perform 
an admissible  heuristic search [Nilsson 1998] of 
the virtual space to find the semantics whose de-
scriptor has the best similarity with the input text. 
This architecture can accomodate more or less 
sophisticated descriptors: from bags of content-
words to be intersected with the input text, up to 
predicted ?top-down? predicate-argument tuples 
to be matched with ?bottom-up? tuples extracted 
from the input text through a rough information-
extraction process. 
Up to now the emphasis of this work has been 
more on automatic reconstruction of a legacy 
document than on interaction, but we have re-
cently started to think about adapting the ap-
proach to ITU. The heuristic search that we 
mentioned above associates with a menu choice 
an estimate of the best similarity score that could 
be obtained by some complete semantic structure 
extending that choice. It is then possible to rank 
choices according to that heuristic estimate (or 
some refinement of it obtained by deepening the

 Which was initially designed to produce parallel texts in 
several languages, but can be easily adapted to the produc-
tion of non-textual ?renderings? of the semantic representa-
tions. 
search a few steps down the line), and then to 
propose to the author a re-ranked menu. 
While we are currently pursuing this promis-
ing line of research because of its conceptual and 
algorithmic simplicity, it has some weaknesses. 
It relies on similarity scores between an input 
text and a descriptor that are defined in a some-
what ad hoc manner, it depends on parameters 
that are fixed a priori rather than by training, and 
it is difficult to associate with confidence levels 
having a clear interpretation.  
A way of solving these problems is to move 
towards a more probabilistic approach that com-
bines advantages of being built on accepted prin-
ciples and of having a well-developed learning 
theory. We finally turn our attention to existing 
work in this area that holds promise for improv-
ing ITU. 
5 Towards statistical ITU 
Recent research on the interactive statistical ma-
chine translation system TransType [Foster et al 
1997; Foster et al 2002] holds special interest in 
relation to ITU. This system, outlined in Fig. 4, 
aims at helping a translator type her (uncon-
strained) translation of a source text by predict-
ing sequences of characters that are likely to 
follow already typed characters in the target text; 
this prediction is done on the basis of informa-
tion present in the source text. The approach is 
similar to standard statistical MT4, but instead of 
producing one single best translation, the system 
ranks several completion proposals according to 
a probabilistic confidence measure and uses this 
measure to optimize the length of completions 
proposed to the translator for validation. Evalua-
tions of the first version of TransType have al-
ready shown significant gains in terms of the 
number of keystrokes needed for producing a 
translation, and work is continuing for making 
the approach effective in real translation envi-
ronments. 
 
If we now compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we see 
strong parallels between TransType and ITU: 
language model enumerating word sequences vs

 Initially statistical MT used a noisy-channel approach 
[Brown et al 1993]; but recently [Och and Ney 2002] have 
introduced a more general framework based on the maxi-
mum-entropy principle, which shows nice prospects in 
terms of flexibility and learnability. An interesting research 
thread is to use more linguistic structure in a statistical 
translation model [Yamada and Knight 2001], which has 
some relevance to ITU since we need to handle structured 
semantic data. 
grammar enumerating semantic structures, 
source text vs input text as information sources, 
match between source text and target text vs 
match between input text and semantic structure. 
In TransType the interaction is directly with the 
target text, while in ITU the interaction with the 
semantic structure is mediated through an output 
text realization of that structure. We can thus 
hope to bring some of the techniques developed 
for TransType to ITU, but let us note that some 
of the challenges are different: for instance train-
ing the semantic grammars in ITU cannot be 
done on a directly observable corpus of texts.5

6 Conclusion 
We have introduced an interactive approach to 
text understanding, based on an extension to the 
MDA document authoring system. ITU at this 
point is more a research program than a com-
pleted realization. However we think it repre-
sents an exciting direction towards permitting a 
reliable deep semantic analysis of input docu-
ments by complementing automatic information

 Let us briefly mention that we are not the first to note for-
mal connections between natural language understanding 
and statistical MT. Thus, [Epstein 1996], working in a non-
interactive framework, draws the following parallel between 
the two tasks: while in MT, the aim is to produce a target 
text from a source text, in NLU, the aim is to produce a 
semantic representation from an input text. He then goes on 
to adapt the conventional noisy channel MT model of 
[Brown et al1993] to NLU, where extracting a semantic 
representation from an input text corresponds to finding: 
argmax(Sem) {p(Input|Sem) p(Sem)}, where p(Sem) is a 
model for generating semantic representations, and 
p(Input|Sem) is a model for the relation between semantic 
representations and corresponding texts. See also [Berger 
and Lafferty 1999] and [Knight and Marcu 2002] for paral-
lels between statistical MT and Information Retrieval and 
Summarization respectively. On a different plane, in the 
context of interactive NLG, [Nickerson 2003] has recently 
proposed to rank semantic choices according to probabilities 
estimated from a corpus; but here the purpose is not text 
understanding, but improving the speed of authoring a new 
document from scratch. 
extraction with a minimal amount of human in-
tervention for those aspects of understanding that 
presently resist automation.
