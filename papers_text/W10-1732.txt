Abstract
We describe our experiments with hier-
archical phrase-based machine translation
for WMT 2010 Shared Task. We provide
a detailed description of our configuration
and data so the results are replicable. For
English-to-Czech translation, we experi-
ment with several datasets of various sizes
and with various preprocessing sequences.
For the other 7 translation directions, we
just present the baseline results.
1 Introduction
Czech is a language with rich morphology (both
inflectional and derivational) and relatively free
word order. In fact, the predicate-argument struc-
ture, often encoded by fixed word order in English,
is usually captured by inflection (especially the
system of 7 grammatical cases) in Czech. While
the free word order of Czech is a problem when
translating to English (the text should be parsed
first in order to determine the syntactic functions
and the English word order), generating correct in-
flectional affixes is indeed a challenge for English-
to-Czech systems. Furthermore, the multitude
of possible Czech word forms (at least order of
magnitude higher than in English) makes the data
sparseness problem really severe, hindering both
directions.
There are numerous ways how these issues
could be addressed. For instance, parsing and
syntax-aware reordering of the source-language
sentences can help with the word order differ-
ences (same goal could be achieved by a reorder-
ing model or a synchronous context-free grammar
in a hierarchical system). Factored translation, a
secondary language model of morphological tags
or even a morphological generator are some of the
possible solutions to the poor-to-rich translation is-
sues.
Our submission to the shared task should reveal
where a pure hierarchical system stands in this jun-
gle and what of the above mentioned ideas match
the phenomena the system suffers from. Although
our primary focus lies on English-to-Czech trans-
lation, we also report the accuracy of the same
system on moderately-sized corpora for the other
three languages and seven translation directions.
2 The Translation System
Our translation system belongs to the hierarchi-
cal phrase-based class (Chiang, 2007), i.e. phrase
pairs with nonterminals (rules of a synchronous
context-free grammar) are extracted from sym-
metrized word alignments and subsequently used
by the decoder. We use Joshua, a Java-based open-
source implementation of the hierarchical decoder
(Li et al, 2009), release 1.1.1
Word alignment was computed using the first
three steps of the train-factored-phrase-
model.perl script packed with Moses2 (Koehn et
al., 2007). This includes the usual combination of
word clustering using mkcls3 (Och, 1999), two-
way word alignment using GIZA++4 (Och and
Ney, 2003), and alignment symmetrization using
the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al,
2003).
For language modeling we use the SRILM
toolkit5 (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and
Goodman, 1998).
We use the Z-MERT implementation of mini-
mum error rate training (Zaidan, 2009). The fol-
lowing settings have been used for Joshua and Z-
MERT:

3 Data and Pre-processing Pipeline
3.1 Baseline Experiments
We applied our system to all eight language pairs.
However, for all but one we ran only a baseline ex-
periment. From the data point of view the baseline
experiments were even more constrained than the
organizers of the shared task suggested. We did not
use the Europarl corpus, we only used the News
Commentary corpus6 for training. The target side
of the News Commentary corpus was also the only
source to train the language model. Table 1 shows
the size of the corpus.
Corpus SentPairs Tokens xx Tokens en
cs-en 94,742 2,077,947 2,327,656
de-en 100,269 2,524,909 2,484,445
es-en 98,598 2,742,935 2,472,860
fr-en 84,624 2,595,165 2,137,407
Table 1: Number of sentence pairs and tokens for
every language pair in the News Commentary cor-
pus. Unlike the organizers of the shared task, we
stick with the standard ISO 639 language codes: cs
= Czech, de = German, en = English, es = Spanish,
fr = French.
Note that in some cases the grammar extraction
algorithm in Joshua fails if the training corpus con-
tains sentences that are too long. Removing sen-
tences of 100 or more tokens (per advice by Joshua
developers) effectively healed all failures. Unfor-
tunately, for the baseline corpora the loss of train-
ing material was still considerable and resulted in
drop of BLEU score, though usually insignificant.7

wmt10/translation-task.html using the link ?Parallel
corpus training data?.
7Table 1 and Table 2 present statistics before removing the
long sentences.
The News Test 2008 data set (2051 sentences
in each language) was used as development data
for MERT. BLEU scores reported in this paper
were computed on the News Test 2009 set (2525
sentences each language). The official scores on
News Test 2010 are given only in the main WMT
2010 paper.
Only lowercased data were used for the baseline
experiments.
3.2 English-to-Czech
A separate set of experiments has been conducted
for the English-to-Czech direction and larger data
were used. We used CzEng 0.9 (Bojar and
?abokrtsk?, 2009)8 as our main parallel corpus.
Following CzEng authors? request, we did not use
sections 8* and 9* reserved for evaluation pur-
poses.
As the baseline training dataset (?Small? in the
following) only the news section of CzEng was
used. For large-scale experiments (?Large? in the
following), we used all CzEng together with the
EMEA corpus9 (Tiedemann, 2009).10
As our monolingual data we use the mono-
lingual data provided by WMT10 organizers for
Czech. Table 2 shows the sizes of these corpora.
Corpus SentPairs Tokens cs Tokens en
Small 126,144 2,645,665 2,883,893
Large 7,543,152 79,057,403 89,018,033
Mono 13,042,040 210,507,305
Table 2: Number of sentences and tokens in the
Czech-English corpora.
Again, the official WMT 201011 development
set (News Test 2008, 2051 sentences each lan-
guage) and test set (News Test 2009, 2525 sen-
tences each language) are used forMERT and eval-
uation, respectively. The official scores on News
Test 2010 are given only in the main WMT 2010
paper.
We use a slightly modified tokenization rules
compared to CzEng export format. Most notably,
we normalize English abbreviated negation and
auxiliary verbs (?couldn?t? ? ?could not?) and

10Unfortunately, the EMEA corpus is badly tokenized on
the Czech side with fractional numbers split into several to-
kens (e.g. ?3, 14?). We attempted to reconstruct the original
detokenized form using a small set of regular expressions.

attempt at normalizing quotation marks to distin-
guish between opening and closing one following
proper typesetting rules.
The rest of our pre-processing pipeline matches
the processing employed in CzEng (Bojar and
?abokrtsk?, 2009).12 We use ?supervised truecas-
ing?, meaning that we cast the case of the lemma
to the form, relying on our morphological analyz-
ers and taggers to identify proper names, all other
words are lowercased.
4 Experiments
All BLEU scores were computed directly by
Joshua on the News Test 2009 set. Note that
they differ from what the official evaluation script
would report, due to different tokenization.
4.1 Baseline Experiments
The set of baseline experiments with all translation
directions involved running the system on lower-
cased News Commentary corpora. Word align-
ments were computed on 4-character stems (in-
cluding the en-cs and cs-en directions). A trigram
language model was trained on the target side of
the parallel corpus.
Direction BLEU
en-cs 0.0905
en-de 0.1114
cs-en 0.1471
de-en 0.1617
en-es 0.1966
en-fr 0.2001
fr-en 0.2020
es-en 0.2025
Table 3: Lowercased BLEU scores of the baseline
experiments on News Test 2009 data.
4.2 English-to-Czech
The extended (non-baseline) English-to-Czech ex-
periments were trained on larger parallel and
monolingual data, described in Section 3.2. Note
that the dataset denoted as ?Small? still falls into
the constrained task because it only uses CzEng
0.9 and the WMT 2010 monolingual data.
12Due to the subsequent processing, incl. parsing, the tok-
enization of English follows PennTreebenk style. The rather
unfortunate convention of treating hyphenated words as sin-
gle tokens increases our out-of-vocabulary rate.
Word alignments were computed on lemmatized
version of the parallel corpus. Hexagram language
model was trained on the monolingual data. True-
cased data were used for training, as described
above; the BLEU scores of these experiments in
Table 4 are computed on truecased system output.
Setup BLEU
Baseline 0.0905
Small 0.1012
Large 0.1300
Table 4: BLEU scores (lowercased baseline, true-
cased rest) of the English-to-Czech experiments,
including the baseline experiment with News
Commentary, mentioned earlier.
As for the official evaluation on News Test
2010, we used the Small setup as our primary sub-
mission, and the Large setup as secondary despite
its better results. The reason was that it was not
clear whether the experiment would be finished in
time for the official evaluation.13
An interesting perspective on the three en-cs
models is provided by the feature weights opti-
mized duringMERT.We can see in Table 5 that the
small and relatively weak baseline LM is trusted
less than the most influential translation feature
while for large parallel data and even much larger
LM the weights are distributed more evenly.
Setup LM Pt0 Pt1 Pt2 WP
Baseline 1.0 1.55 0.51 0.63 ?2.63
Small 1.0 1.03 0.72 ?0.09 ?0.34
Large 1.0 0.98 0.97 ?0.02 ?0.82
Table 5: Feature weights are relative to the weight
of LM , the score by the language model. Then
there are the three translation features: Pt0 =
P (e|f), Pt1 = Plex(f |e) and Pt2 = Plex(e|f).
WP is the word penalty.
4.3 Efficiency
The machines on which the experiments were con-
ducted are 64bit Intel Xeon dual core 2.8 GHz
CPUs with 32 GB RAM.
Word alignment of each baseline corpus took
about 1 hour, time needed for data preprocessing
13In fact, it was not finished in time. Due to a failure of
a MERT run, we used feature weights from the primary sub-
mission for the secondary one, too.
214
and training of the language model was negligible.
Grammar extraction took about four hours but it
could be parallelized. For decoding the test data
were split into 20 chunks that were processed in
parallel. OneMERT iteration, including decoding,
took from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Training the large en-cs models requires more
careful engineering. The grammar extraction eas-
ily consumes over 20 GB memory so it is impor-
tant to make sure Java really has access to it. We
parallelized the extraction in the same way as we
had done with the decoding; even so, about 5 hours
were needed to complete the extraction. The de-
coder now must use the SWIG-linked SRILM li-
brary because Java-based languagemodeling is too
slow and memory-consuming. Otherwise, the de-
coding times are comparable to the baseline exper-
iments.
5 Conclusion
We have described the hierarchical phrase-based
SMT system we used for the WMT 2010 shared
task. For English-to-Czech translation, we dis-
cussed experiments with large data from the point
of view of both the translation accuracy and effi-
ciency.
This has been our first attempt to switch to hier-
archical SMT and we have not gone too far beyond
just putting together the infrastructure and apply-
ing it to the available data. Nevertheless, our en-cs
experiments not only confirm that more data helps;
in the Small and Large setup, the data was not only
larger than in Baseline, it also underwent a more
refined preprocessing. In particular, we took ad-
vantage of the Czeng corpus being lemmatized to
produce better word alignment; also, the truecas-
ing technique helped to better target named enti-
ties.
