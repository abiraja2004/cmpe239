Abstract
Automatically-derived grammars, such as the
split-and-merge model, have proven helpful
in parsing (Petrov et al, 2006). As such
grammars are refined, latent information is
recovered which may be usable for linguis-
tic tasks besides parsing. In this paper, we
present and examine a new method of seman-
tic relation classification: using automatically-
derived grammar rule clusters as a robust
knowledge source for semantic relation clas-
sification. We examine performance of this
feature group on the SemEval 2010 Relation
Classification corpus, and find that it improves
performance over both more coarse-grained
and more fine-grained syntactic and colloca-
tional features in semantic relation classifica-
tion.
1 Introduction
In the process of discovering a refined grammar
starting from rules in the original treebank gram-
mar, latent-variable grammars recover latent infor-
mation. Intuitively, the new split grammar states
should reflect linguistic information that has been
generalized from the lexical level but is not so gen-
eral as the original syntactic level. While the in-
tended use of this information is to improve syntac-
tic parsing, the lexically-derived nature of the split
grammar states suggests it may contain semantic in-
formation as well.
Petrov et al (2006) note that while some of these
split grammar states reflect true linguistic informa-
tion, such as the clustering of verbs with similar de-
pendencies, other grammar states may reflect use-
less information, such as a split between rules that
each terminate in a comma. However, it is the auto-
matic nature of grammar splitting which shows po-
tential for deriving semantic knowledge; such split
grammar states may reflect statistical and linguistic
observations not noticed by humans.
In this paper, we use this recovered latent infor-
mation for the classification of semantic relations.
Our goal is to determine whether recovered latent
grammatical information is capable of contributing
to the real-world linguistic task of relation classifica-
tion. We will compare the feature performance of re-
covered latent information with that of other syntac-
tic and collocational features to determine whether
or not the recovered latent information is helpful in
semantic relation classification.
2 Task Description
We performed the task of classifying semantic rela-
tions from SemEval 2010 Task 8: Multi-way Clas-
sification of Semantic Relations between Pairs of
Nominals. Each instance consists of a sentence,
marked with two nominals, e1 and e2. One of 19
possible direction-sensitive relations is annotated for
each pair of nominals. Two examples are shown be-
low.

from the Roman practice of enfeoffing various

perial provinces.
Relation: Entity-Origin(e1,e2)
We classified the semantic relations using a
Maximum Entropy classifier. In our system,
classification was 19-way, direction-sensitive1
between the classifications: Entity-Origin, Entity-
Destination, Cause-Effect, Product-Producer,
Content-Container, Instrument-Agency, Member-
Collection, Component-Whole, Message-Topic,
and Other (non-directional). The model was trained
on the 8000-instance training section of the Se-
mEval 2010 Task 8 Semantic Relations Corpus.
Distribution of the training data is shown in Table 1
(Hendrickx et al, 2010).

We tested the model on the 2717-instance testing
section of the same corpus. For each instance, the
user was provided with a sentence containing two
marked entities, e1 and e2. We structured the task
such that, for each instance, we chose the best se-
mantic relation out of the 19 available.
In this paper, we use grammatical cluster infor-
mation (i.e., recovered latent information) from the
Berkeley Parser (Petrov 2006) as semantic features
of syntactic origin to classify semantic relations in
the SemEval 2010 Semantic Relations corpus, in a
1i.e., with a Content-Container relation, the nominal that is
the container and the nominal that is the content cannot be re-
versed.
Maximum Entropy model. We conduct two sets of
experiments. In the first experiment, we examine the
effect of using Berkeley Parser latent cluster features
to enhance specificity over more general features
(POS tags and others), where the cluster features are
inherently more closely tuned with the data than the
other features, and more likely to lead to an over-
fitted model. In the second experiment, we examine
the effect of using cluster features to enhance gener-
alizability over more specific features (the words of
the cluster features? terminal nodes), in which case
the cluster features generalize over othe more spe-
cific features, but are more likely to miss detailed
patterns.
2.1 Previous Work
The classification of semantic relations has been
proposed to help NLP tasks ranging from word sense
disambiguation, language modelling, paraphrasing,
and recognising textual entailment (Hendrickx et al,
2010).
Semantic world knowledge is crucial for accurate
semantic classification of many types, and sources
range from the hand-crafted-yet sparse (such as
WordNet) to the robust-yet-noisy (such as the In-
ternet). For this community task, teams proposed
a variety of knowledge sources and other fea-
tures for their relation classification, from knowl-
edge databases (Tymoshenko and Giuliano, 2010),
WordNet (Rink and Harabagiu, 2010), Wikipedia
(Szarvas and Gurevych, 2010), to formal linguistic
Levin classes (Rink and Harabagiu, 2010), to col-
locational metrics (Rink and Harabagiu, 2010) and
stems (Chen et al, 2010).
Syntactic features present special benefits to any
semantic classification task: they can generalize
over the local context in ways that collocational met-
rics cannot, and unlike knowledge database sources
which assign the most common word sense to a
word, syntactic features are sensitive to the word?s
sense, as determined by the local context of the
word. Several teams in SemEval 2010 Task 8 used
syntactic features for semantic relation classifica-
tion. Chen et al (2010) use a feature set of the
syntactic parent node held in common by the two
nominals. Rink and Harabagiu (2010) use a feature
set of dependency paths of length 1 or 2 from the
dependency tree around the two nominals.
47
2.2 Grammatical cluster information
For our investigations, we used the Berkeley Parser
(Petrov et al2006, Petrov and Klein 2007) as a
source of grammar rule clusters. We used the
eng sm6.gr off-the-shelf model.
The Berkeley Parser starts with an initial gram-
mar extracted from Wall Street Journal corpus sec-
tions 2-22. The parser then tries to learn a set of rule
probabilities over latent annotations to maximize the
likelihood of the training trees using Expectation-
Maximization (EM).
Consider a sentence w and its unannotated tree T ,
a non-terminal A spanning (r, t), and its children B
and C spanning (r, s) and (s, t). Ax is a subsymbol
ofA, Bx ofB, and Cx of C. We calculate the poste-
rior probability of all annotated rules and positions
for each training set tree T in the Expectation step
(Petrov et al, 2006):
(1)
P ((r, s, t, Ax ? ByCz) | w, T ) ? POUT(r, t, Ax)
??(Ax ? ByCz)PIN(r, s, By)PIN(s, t, Cz)
The probabilities from the Expectation step act as
weighted observations to update the rule probabili-
ties in the Maximization step:
?(Ax ? ByCz) :=
#{Ax ? ByCz}
?y?,z?#{Ax ? By?Cz?}
(2)
In each cycle of EM, the grammar is split ran-
domly in halves, and some halves are merged back
together. The grammar is retrained, and the results
are used to initialize the next round of EM.
In the splitting step, all grammatical nodes are
split in two. Although the grammar grows more
finely fitted to the training data with each splitting
step, its size quickly becomes unmanageable, its
rules become overfitted, and because the splits are
not a result of likelihood calculation, many unhelp-
ful rules are produced. The merging step functions
to remove unhelpful rules. In the merging step, each
split is examined for the loss of likelihood removing
it would cause; splits whose likelihood contribution
is below a cutoff are re-combined.
The experiments we perform in this paper are a
gamble on the possibility that the saved splits are
picking up semantic information from the rule struc-
ture they reflect in the increased likelihood. We use
the final split cluster ID?s (PP-5, PP-8, etc.) as fea-
tures in our experiments.2
2.3 Features
We used several sets of features in our experi-
ments. All POS-tags, syntactic structure, and Clus-
ter ID features come from the Berkeley Parser. The
lemmatization comes from Morpha (Minnen et al,
2001). All features occurring less than two times in
the training data were discarded, for ease of process-
ing. A sample sentence and the resulting features
are shown in Table 2. Note that all features, col-
locational and syntactic, were used for discovering
semantic knowledge.

Table 2: A sample sentence and its accompanying fea-
tures.
Collocational Features:
? Surrounding Words (SW): From Ye and
Baldwin?s (2007) preposition sense disam-
biguation system, this set of features consists
of lemmas of all of the words within a window
of seven words before and after each of e1 and
e2. Features are not, however, marked with rel-
ative location, as we found that this reduced ac-
curacy.
? In-Between Words (IBW): This bag of fea-
tures consists of the string of words occuring in
the sentence in between e1 and e2, exclusive, as
well as all the substrings of those consecutive
words. We tried marking each feature with its
relative location, but we found that results im-
proved without location marking, and so we do
not use location marking in these experiments.
2Note that cluster ID?s are only meaningful when compared
to other cluster ID?s split from the same parent node.
48
Syntactic Features:
? Open Class Words (OCW): from Ye and
Baldwin?s (2007) preposition sense disam-
biguation system, this set of features consists
of the lemmas of all of the open-class words in
the sentence (i.e., NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP).
? POS-tags: The POS tags of the words (i.e., ter-
minal nodes) and all consecutive strings of POS
tags in between e1 and e2, exclusive. Tags are
from the Berkeley Parser.
? Cluster ID?s: The Berkeley Parser syntactic
rule cluster ID?s and POS-tags of the termi-
nal nodes in between e1 and e2. ID numbers
are only relevant when comparing ID?s with the
same POS tag.
3 Experiment: Cluster ID?s as more spcific
features
In our first experiment, we compared two sys-
tems of Surrounding Words, Open-Class Words, and
In-Between Terminal Tags, with and without In-
Between Terminal Cluster ID?s. The results are
shown in Table 3.
3.1 Results and Analysis
Table 3 shows the results of adding more spe-
cific Cluster ID features to the more general POS-
tag, Open-Class, and Surrounding-Words features.
While this could have led to an over-fitted model, ap-
parently it did not. Overall precision increased from
66.60% to 68.62%, an increase of 2.02%, yet recall
also increased, from 64.26% to 65.33%, an increase
of 1.07%. The more precise, more closely-fitted
features did not harm performance, but actually en-
hanced it. The Maximum Entropy learner itself pre-
ferred the Cluster ID features: Table 4 shows per-
class POS-tag and Cluster-ID features with a lambda
value over 0.25, comparing when both POS-tag fea-
tures and Cluster ID tags are available, versus just
POS-tags (all among other features used in Experi-
ment 1). When given the opportunity, the MaxEnt
learner considered the Cluster ID features more im-
portant than the POS-tag features.
As shown in Table 3, we can see that adding
the Cluster ID?s did mildly increase F-measure
(by 1.41 %, from 65.01% to 66.42%3. How-
ever, when viewed on a class-by-class basis, some
classes show great improvement with the addition
of Cluster ID?s while others remain unchanged. The
classes Cause-Effect, Component-Whole, Content-
Container, Instrument-Agency, and Message-Topic
all gained significantly with the addition of cluster
ID features. We investigated important features of
these classes more carefully.
Classes that significantly improved with Cluster
ID?s:
? Cause-Effect: Cluster ID features that cor-
related highly with Cause-Effect, besides
keyword-type single word clusters (from, that),
were a cluster of certain occurances of the
prepositions by, from, of, in; and a cluster of
cause-type verbs (shown in Table 5) plus the
phrase by.
? Content-Container: Features positively corre-
lated with Content-Container, besides some
keywords and phrases such as full of, was, in,
and the/a, included a Cluster ID feature with
a number of verbs commonly used to refer to
containers and the processes of filling and emp-
tying them, such as leaked, contained, poured,
stuffed, took, injected, inserted, and found. The
verbs from this feature are listed in Table 6.
? Instrument-Agency: Several Cluster ID fea-
tures of verbs correlate with this class. Al-
though it is not as obvious as the verb list with
Cause-Effect, Table 7 compares several verb
clusters that did have a noticeable positive cor-
relation with Instrument-Agency with several
verb clusters of the same POS-tags that did not
correlate.
? Component-Whole: Notable keyword and key
phrase features include of the/a/an, has a, and
has. One Cluster ID feature is a cluster of third-
person, possessive, and reflexive pronouns. Al-
3An F-measure of 66.42% would have put our system in the
middle of the pack on Task performance if it had participated
in the actual SemEval 2010 Task 8. Task results for the entire
dataset ranged from 82.18% F-m with a carefully-design knowl-
edge database, to 52.16% with parse features, NE?s, and seman-
tic seed lists, and 26.67% using punctuation, prepositional pat-
terns, and context words. Our goal, however, is to determine
whether recovered latent grammatical information is capable of
contributing to relation classification at all.

feature was a cluster of the prepositions about,

ing a number of ?discussion? and ?document?

Classes that did not significantly improve with
Cluster ID?s:
? Entity-Origin: This class is suspected to have
been plagued by faulty annotation. 7 out of
the first 24 training examples are incorrectly
marked as Entity-Origin, according to the cor-
pus?s definitions. This noise in the data likely
prevents effective comparison of features. De-
spite the noise, some clusters with a high cor-
relation to the class include: a cluster of verbs

consisting of mostly made, kept, and left; and
a cluster of verbs consisting mostly of made,
left, kept, departed, arrived, travelled, and con-
sisted.
? Entity-Destination: The Cluster ID features
that correlated highly with this class mark in-
dividual key words and phrases: for the, on the,
to the, and to. Clusters of words were not help-
ful for this class.
? Product-Producer: The Cluster ID features
that strongly correlated with this class con-
sisted mostly of the words who/whom and by;
individual key word features would have been
just as good. Several clusters of verbs were
highly correlated as well, but apparently there
was too much noise in the clusters for them to
be effective.
? Member-Collection: This class used the ?jj-
24? POS cluster, which contains the word other
among other adjectives. This is probably from
the classic Member-Collection phrase ?Y and
other X?s?. However, this features, along with a
feature mostly consisting of of, was not enough
to make much difference (0.33%) over POS
features.
? Other: The class Other decreased in F-
measure with the addition of cluster ID fea-
tures. Combined with the overall F-measure
increase for all the regular classes, we inter-
pret this decrease in F-measure as an increase
in entropy, as more examples with identifiable
useful features are removed from the Other cat-
egory, and the MaxEnt learner has fewer accu-
rate patterns with which to cluster this diverse
group of examples. In order words, we actually
desire to see a decrease in Other F-measure, as
the examples in Other have almost nothing in
common with eachother and should be hard to
identify.
Overall, some of the semantic relation classes
were correlated with features of syntactic clusters,
and the clusters boosted scores, while other classes
weren?t, and their scores remained roughly the same.
The results of this experiment show that syntactic
clusters did not lead to overtraining of data, and were
helpful with semantic relation classification.
4 Experiment: Cluster ID?s as more
general features
In our second experiment, using the same experi-
mental set-up but different features, we compared
In-Between Words (IBW), IBW Plus POS-tags, and
IBW Plus POS-tags Plus Cluster ID features. The
results are shown in Table 9. The goal of this exper-
iment is to compare Cluster ID features to an even
more fine-grained feature, the words themselves.
The words, POS-tags, and Cluster ID tags all con-
cern the same nodes in the sentence.
4.1 Results and Analysis
Table 9 shows the results of adding coarser-grained
Cluster ID features to the more specific In-Between-
Words features, as well as to the POS-tag features.
The addition of Cluster ID features improved clas-
sification over IBW plus POS-tags, as well as IBW
alone. While the previous experiment showed that
Cluster ID features were not too specific to be help-
ful, this experiment shows that they are also not too
general as to blur lexical patterns. While overall F-
measure increased 2.13% from IBW with the addi-
tion of POS-tag features, from 63.35% to 65.48%,
F-measure also increased further by the addition of
Cluster ID features to IBW plus POS-tags, with a to-
tal increase of 2.72% over IBW features alone, from
63.35% to 66.07%.

line, IBW features, and adding coarser grained fea-
tures, POS-tags and Cluster IDs, we might expect
to see a simultaneous decrease in precision and in-
crease in recall from the baseline IBW to the en-
hanced, POS-tag and Cluster ID versions. As can be
seen in Table 10, this is exactly what happens. How-
ever, Cluster ID features are found to be helpful to
the overall goal of semantic relation classification,
because they increase recall by much more (4.44%)
than they decrease precision (-0.44%).
Classes for which the Cluster ID plus
POS-tag plus IBW combo was highest in-
clude Content-Container, Entity-Destination,
Member-Collection, Message-Topic, and Other.
Component-Whole, Instrument-Agency, and
Product-Producer all showed gains over just IBW,
but had lower scores than IBW plus just POS-tags.
Only Cause-Effect and Entity-Origin failed to
show any improvement with POS-tags or Cluster
ID?s over the baseline IBW features.
A comparison of features between Experiments
1 and 2 showed that nearly all of the significantly
helpful positive-corellated Cluster ID features (with
lambda greater than 0.25) in Experiment 2 were also
important in Experiment 1. Some cluster ID features
in Experiment 1 that isolated out a single word were
replaced in Experiment 2 by a more-accurate indi-
vidual IBW word feature.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a new method of se-
mantic relation classification: using automatically-
derived grammar rule clusters as a semantic knowl-
edge source for relation classification. We tested
performance of the feature on the SemEval 2010
Relation Classification corpus, and found that it im-
proved performance over both more coarse-grained
