Abstract 
In this paper, we describe a system and meth- 
ods for finding structural correspondences from the 
paired dependency structures of a source sentence 
and its translation in a target language. The sys- 
tem we have developed finds word correspondences 
first, then finds phrasal correspon(tences based on 
word correspondences. We have also developed a
GUI system with which a user can check and cor- 
rect tile correspondences retrieved by the system. 
These structural correspondences will be used as 
raw translation I)atterns in a corpus-based transla- 
tion system. 
1 Introduction 
So far, a number of methodologies and systelns 
for machine trauslation using large corpora exist. 
They include example-based at)proaches \[7, 8, 9, 
12\], pattern-based approaches \[10, 11, 14\], and sta- 
tistical approaches. For instance, example-based 
approaches use a large set of translation patterns 
each of which is a pair of parsed structures of a 
source-language fragment and its target-language 
translation fragment. Figure 1 shows an exanl- 
ple of translation by an example-based method, ill 
which translation patterns (pl) and (p2) are se- 
lected as similar to a (left hand) Japanese depen- 
dency structure, and an (right hand) English de- 
pendency structure is constructed by merging the 
target parts of these translation patterns 1.
In this kind of system, it is very important o 
collect a large set of translatiou patterns easily and 
efficiently. Previous systems, however, collect such 
translation patterns mostly manually. Therefore, 
they have problems in terms of the development 
cost. 
1Words in parenthesis at the nodes of the Japanese de- 
pendency structure are representative English translations, 
and are for explanation. 
This paper tries to provide solutions for this is- 
sue by proposing methods for finding structural 
correspondences of parsed trees of a translation 
pair. These structural correspondences are used as 
bases of translation patterns in corpus-based ap- 
proaches. 
Figure 2 shows an example of extracting struc- 
tural correspondences. In this figure, tile left tree 
is a Japanese dependency tree, the right tree is a 
dependency tree of its English translation, dotted 
arrows represent word correspondence, and a pair 
of boxes connected by a solid line represent phrasal 
correspondence. We would like to extract these

Figure 1: Translation Example by Examt)le-based ~li'anslation 
dependency structure. A det)endeney stru('ture as 
used in this pat)er is a tree consisting of nodes and 
links (or m:cs), wh('.re a node represents a content 
word, while a link rel)resents a fllnctional word or 
a relation between content words. For instance, as 
shown in Figure 2, a t)reposition "at;" is represented 
as a l ink  in l~,nglish. 
2.2 F ind ing  Word  Cor respondences  
The  tirst task for finding stru('tm:al corresI)On- 
den(:c's is to lind word (:orro, sl)ondenccs t)et;ween (;he 
nodes of a sour(:e parsed tree and the nodes of a 
t;wget parsed tree. 
Word correspondences are tkmn(1 by eonsull;ing a
source-to-target translation dictionary. Most words 
can find a unique 1;ranslation candidate in a target 
tree, but there are cases such that there are many 
translation candidates in a target parsed tree for 
a source word. Theretbre, the main task of tind- 
ing word correspondences is to determine the most 
plausible l;ranslation word mnong can(tidates. We 
call a pair of a source word and its translation 
candidate word in a target tree a word correspon- 
dence candidate denoted by WC(s,/,), where s is a 
source word and t is a target word. If 17\[TC(s,/,) ix a 
word correspondence andida.te such that there is 
rto other WC originating h'om s, then it is called 
WA word correspondence. 
The basic idea to select the most plausil)le word 
correspondence candidate ix to select a candidate 
which is near to another word correspondence whose 
source is also near to a sour(:e word in question. 
Suppose a source word s has multiple candidate 
translation target words t~ (i = 1,...,7~,), that  is, 
there are multiple 17FCs originating h'om .s'. We, 
denote these multiple word corresl)ondence candi- 
dates by WC(s, tl). For each I'VC of s, this proce- 
dure finds the neighbor WA correspondence whose 
distance to WC ix below a threshold. The distance 
between WC(sl,/,~) and WA(s.2,/,2) is defined as 
the distance between sl and .s2 plus the distmme 
between s2 and 1,2 where a distance between two 
nodes is defined as the number of nodes in the t)ath 
whoso, ends are the two nodes. Among I~VCs of 
.s for which neighbor H/A ix tound, the one with 
the smallest (listan(:(~ is chosen as the word corre- 
Sl)ondenee of s, and I/VCs whMl are not chosen 
are invalidated (or deleted). We call a word corre- 
spondence found t)y this procedure WX.  We use 
3 as t;he distance threshold of the above procedure 
currently. This procedure ix applied to all source 
nodes which have multii)le WCs. Figure 3 shows 
an example of WX word correspondence. In this 
examt)le, since the Japanese word "ki" has two En- 
glish l;ranslation word candidates "time" and "pe- 
riod," there are two WCs  (~7C 1 and WC2). The 
direct parent node "ymlryo" of "ki" has a WA cor- 
respondence (I/VA1) to "concern," and the direct 
child node "ikou" has also a WA correspondc'nee 
(WA2) to "transition." In this ease, since the dis- 
tance between I'VC2 and WA2 is smaller than the 
distan(:e between I.VC1 and WA1, I'VC~ in clmnged 
to a 1/l/X, and I~ITC1 is adandoned. 
In addition to WX correspondences, weconsider 
a special case such that given a word correspon- 
dence l'lZ(s,/,), if s has only one child node which ix

a leaf and t has also only one child node which ix a 
leaf, th(;n we COllStrllet a lleW word correspondence 
called 1US from these two leaf nodes. This WE 
procedure is al)plied to all word correspondences. 
Note tlmt this word correst)ondence is not to se.le, ct 
one of candidates, rather it is a new finding of word 
corre, spondence by utilizing a special structm:e. For 
instance, in Figure 3, if there is a word eorrespol> 
dence 1)etween "ki" and "period" and there is no 
word correst)ondence between "ikou" and "transi- 
tion," then I<V,g(iko'u~ transition) will be found 1)3' 
this 1)roeedure. 
These WX and WS t)rocedures are continuously 
al)plied until no new word correspondences arc t'(mnd. 
Aft;er al)l)lying the above WX and I'VS pro(:e- 
dures, there are some target words t such that t is a 
destination of a l,l/C(.s ", t) and there ix no other 1,176 , 
whose destination ix t:. In this case, the lUG(s,t)  
correspondence andidate is chosen as a valid word 
correspondence b tween s and/,,  and it; is called a 
HzZ word eorrest)ondence. 
We call a source node or a target node of a word 
correspondence an anchor node in what tbllows. 
The above t)rocedures for finding word corre- 
sI)ondences are summarized as follows: 
Find WCs by consulting translation dictionary; 
Find WAs; 
whi le  (true) { 
find WXs; 
find WSs; 
i f  no new word corresp, is found, then  break; 
} 
find WZs;  
2.3 F ind ing  Phrasa l  Co l ' res l )ondences  
The next step is to tind phrasal correspondences 
based on word eorl'eSl)ondences t'(mnd t) 3, 1)roce.- 
dures described in tim previous section. What  we 
would like to retrieve here, is a set of phrasal cor- 
respondences which (:overs all elements of a paired 
dependency trees. 
In what follows, we (:all a portion of a tree which 
consists of nodes in a 1)att~ from a node ?t I (;o all- 
oth(;r node nu which is a descen(lanl; of n:l a lin-. 
ear tree denoted by LT(v,1, n~), and we denote a 
minimal sul)tree including st)coiffed nodes hi,  ..., n.~, 
l)y T (n l , . . . ,n , ) .  For instan(:(,~ in the English tree 
structure (the right tree) in Figure 4, LT(tcch, nology ,
science) is a rectangular area covering %eclmol- 
? tg "e e ~ ogy," and SOl ,no ,, anti .T(J'acl;or, cou'ntrjl ) is a 
1)olygonal area covering "factor,""atDcl,, . . . .  t)ol- 
icy," and "country." 
The tirst step is to find a 1)air of word correst)on- 
dences W, (.~'~, t ) and ~4q(.,.~, t ~) such that .,, a.,t  
s2 constructs a linear tree LT(si ,  s2) and there is no 
anchor node in th(' 1)al;h from s~ to s2 other than .s'~ 
and .s2, where 1UI and H~ denote any tyi)e of word 
('orrest)on(lences 2 and we assmne there is a word 
corresI)ondence t)etwee, n roots of source and (;arget 
trees by defmflt. We construct a t)hrasal correspon- 
dence fi'om source nodes in LT(s , , s2)  and target 
l/o(les itl r \ ] ' ( t : l , / '2 ) ,  (l()llote(t by \];'(l~,~F'(.q'l, .";2), 5\].n(tl, t2)). 
For illstall('e~ ill F ig l l re 41~ \]"11~ \]~12~ 1)'2~ 1)3 and 
\])4 tu.'e source portions of phrasal et)rrespondences 
found in this step. 
The next stel) checks, for ea(:h 1', if all anchor 
l lo(les of wor(1 eorres1)Oll(leile(?s wllose SOUlT(;e o1 ~;al- 
get node is included in P are al,eo included in P. 
If a t)hrasal correst)ondenee satisiies this condition, 
then it is called closed, otherwise it ix called open. 
Further, nodes which are not included in the I ) in 
question are called open nodes. If a l ) ix ot)en, then 
it ix merged with other 1)hrasal correspondences 
having ol)en nodes of P so that the merged 1)hrasal 
correspondence b comes (-losed. 
Next, each P~,, is checked if there is another l)q 
which shares any nodes ottmr than anchor nodes 
with P.,,. If this is the case, these P:., and 1~ are 
lnerged into one phrasal correspondence. In Figure 
4, t)hrasal correspondences i 11 and P12 are merged 
into P1, since their source I)ortions LT (haikei, koku) 
and LT (haikci, seisaku) share "doukou" which is 
not an anchor node. 
Finally, any path whose nodes other than the 
root are not included in any 1)s but the root node 
ix included in a 1 ) is searched for. This procedure

found 1)y this 1)ro(:(xlur(~ is called an open pal, h,, m~(t 
its root no(le is called a pivot. If such an Ol)en path 
is found, it is t)rocessed as follows: l, br each 1)ivot 
node, (a) if the t)ivot is not an mmhor nod(;, then 
open lmths originating fl:om the pivot is merged

? LTY ... P(LT(sl,.S2), LT(tl, t2)) such that 
all nodes other than Sl, s2,1':1 and t.2 have only 
one child node. 
LTX is a special case of LTY, since Sl and tl of 
LTX must have only one child node, on the other 
hand, ones of LTY may have more than two child 
nodes. A subcategory test tbr a phrasal correspon- 
dence is done in the above order. Exmnples of these 
subcategories are shown in Fig 5. 
Tlm result of these subcategories are also shown 
in Table 2. Subcategories MIN and LTX have very 
high accuracy and this result is very promising, 
since we can avoid nmnual checking for ttmse phrasal 
correst)ondences , or we would check only these types 
of t)hrasal correspondences mmmally and discard 
other types. 
As stated earlier, since we removed only sen- 
tences with severe parsing errors from the test set, 
please note that the above mtmbers of experimental 
results are calculated for a bilingual parsed corpus 
including parsing errors. 
4 D iscuss ion  
There have been some studies on structural align- 
Inent of bilingual texts such as \[1, 4, 13, 3, 6\]. Our 
work is similar to these previous tudies at the con- 
ceptual level, but different in some aspects. \[1\] 
reported a method for extracting translation tem- 
plates by CKY parsing of bilingual sentences. This 
work is to get phrase-structure level phrasal cor- 
respondences, but our work is to get dependency- 
structure level phrasal correspondences. \[4\] pro- 
posed a method for extracting structural matclfing 
(pairs of dependency trees) by calculating matching 
similarities of two dependency structures. Their 
work focuses on tile parsing ambiguity resolution 
by calculating structural matching. Further, \[3, 6\] 
proposed structural alignnmnt of dependency struc- 
tures. Their work assuined tha.t least common an- 
cestors of each fragment of a structural correspon- 
dence are preserved, but our work does not have 
such structural restriction. \[13\] is different o oth- 
ers in that it tries to find phrasal correspondences 
by comt)aring a MT result and its manual correc- 
tion. 
In addition to these differences, the main differ- 
ence is to find classes (or categories) of phrasal cor- 
respondences which have high accuracy. In general, 
since bilingual structural alignment is very compli- 
cated and difficult task, it; is very hard to get more 
than 90% accuracy in total. If we get only such 
an accuracy rate, the result is not useful, since we 
need manual clmcks tbr the all correspondences re-
trieved. But, if we can get some classes of phrasal 
correspondence with, for instance, more than 90% 
accuracy rate, then we can reduce manual clmck- 
ing for phrasal correspondences in such classes, and 
this reduces the development cost of translation 
patterns used in later corpus-based translation pro- 
tess. As shown in the previous section, we could 
find ttmt all (:lasses of word correspondences and 
two subclasses of phrasal correspondences are more 
than 90% accurate. 
When actually using this automatically retrieved 
structural correspondence data, we must consider 
how to manually correct the incomplete parts and 
how to reuse mamlal correction data if the parser 
results are ctmnged. 
As for the tbrlner issue, we need an easy-to-use 
tool to modify correspondences to reduce the cost 
of mmmal operation. We have developed a GUI 
tool as shown in Figure 6. In this figure, the bot- 
tom half presents a pair of source and target depen- 
dency structures with word correspondences (solid 
lines) and phrasal correspondences ( equences of 
slmded circles). You can easily correct correspon- 
dences by looking at this graplfical presentation. 
As for tlm latter issue, we must develop meth- 
ods for reusing the manual correction data as much 
as possible even if tim parser outputs are changed. 
We have developed a tool for attaching phrasal 
correspondences by using existing phrasal corm- 
spondence data. This is implemented as follows: 
Each phrasal correspondence is assigned a signa- 
ture which is a pair of source and target, sentences, 
each of which tins bracketed segments which are in- 
cluded in the phrasal correspondence. For instance,

In the above e, xample, segments betwee, n '\[' and '\]' 
represent a phrasal correspondence. 
If new parsed dqmndency structures for a sen- 
tence pair is given, for each phrasal correspondence 
signature of the sentence pair, nodes in the struc- 
tures wtfich are inside 1)rackets of the signature are 
marked, mid if there is a minimal sul)tree consist- 
ing of only marked nodes, then a phrasal corre- 
Sl)ondence is reconstructed from the phrasal corre- 
spondence signature. By using this tool, we can 
efficiently reuse the manual efforts as much as pos- 
sible even if parsers are updated. 
5 Conc lus ion  
Ill this I)al)er, we have t)rol)osed methods for 
finding structural correspondences (word correst)on- 
dences and i)hrasal corr(;spondences) of bilingual 
parsed corpus. Further, we showed that the t)reci- 
sion of word correst)ond(mces and some catc'gories 
of t)hrasal corresl)ondences found 1)y our methods 
are highly accurate, and these correst)ondences can 
reduce the cost of trm~slation pattern accumula- 
tion. 
In addition to these results, we showed a GUI 
tool for mmmal correction and a tool for reusing 
previous correspondence data. 
As fld;ure directions, we will find more subclasses 
with high accuracy to reduce the cost for transla- 
tion pattern preparation. 
We believe that these methods and tools can ac- 
celerate the collection of a large set of translation 
patterns and the developlnent of a corlms-based 
translation system.
