The system of  t ransparent  in tens iona l  log ic  (TIL) in t ro -  
duced by Pavel  Tich~ i s  used as a framework fo r  a descr ip t ion  
of  knowledge representat ion  in  n~n - machine con,nunicat ion.  
A deta i led  expos i t ion  of  TIL can be found in  /1 / .  
A language express ion  denotes  an ob jec t  by express ing  
i t s  const ruc t ion .  The syntact i c  s t ruc ture  o f  the  express ion  
re f lec ts  the s t ruc ture  of  the cor respond ing  const ruc t ion  ( thus  
obeying F rege 's  p r inc ip le  of  oompos i t iona l i ty ) .  To analyze an 
express ion  semant ica l l y  means to determine the const ruc t ion  i t  
expresses .  Ord inary  language express ions  have o f ten  more than 
one ana lys i s .  
The ana lyses  of  language express ions  ( i .e .  construct~, 
ions )  can be represented  by ~-express ions .  This  representat -  
i ona l  language has the same express ive  power (w i th in  the f rame-  
work of  TIL) as the natura l  language,  but has no ambigu i t ies .  
The in fe rence  ru les  of  TIT serve  as a theoret i ca l  foundat ion  
fo r  the  in fe rence  necessary  in  knowledge representat ion .  
The in f in i te  h ie rarchy  of  types in TIL makes i t  poss ib le  
to  work wi th  proper t ies  of  p roper t ies  or wi th  re la t ions  between 
an  ind iv idua l  and a propos i t ion  in  the same way as the f i r s t  
o rder  theor ies  work wi th  re la t ions  between ind iv idua ls .  Thus, 
TIL can be cons idered  to  be a l im i t  case o f  the theor ies  of  
o rder  n.

A s~stem for  knowledKe representat ion ,  based on TIL, i s  
p resent ly  under deve lo~nent .  I t s  knowledge base conta ins  a 
spec ia l  atom represent ing  the system i t se l f ,  and cer ta in  proc -  
edures a l low the system to determine the  t ru th -va lue  of propos-  
i t i ons  concern ing  i t s  knowledge ( th i s  can be cons idered  as a 
rud imentary  form of se l f - re f lec t ion) .  This feature  a l lows the  
system to  in fe r  cor rec t  answers e .g .  in  the fo l low ing  convers -  
a t ion ,  where x ,y  are  var iab les  fo r  ind iv idua ls  and p i s  a 
var iab le  fo r  p roper t ies !  rep l ies  from the system are marked 
by >>>: 
(I) John is a boy and Paul is a boy. >>> Hm. 
(2) Is Tom a boy? >>> I don't know. 
(3) If x is a boy then you know that x is a boy. >>> Hm. 
/,4) Is Tom a boy? >>> No. 
(5) x is omniscient with respeot to p Iff 
( i f  y ins tant ia tes  p then x knows that  y ins tant ia tes  p ) .  
>>> I-Ira. 
(6) With respect to which property are you ommlscent? 
>>> Boyhood. 
Not_..ee: Before the start of the conversation, the system is in 
the initial state, where basic infer,no, rules have been 
programmed and grannnar and a dictionary have been introduced. 
but no fac tua l  knowledge. The d ic t ionary  ent r ies  conta in  in  
most cases on ly  a word, i t s  c lass  and the type of  the ob jec t  
i t  denotes .  
The self-referential oapacit~ is one of the strong feat- 
ures of natural language (thus allowing the linguist to de- 
scribe the object of his study). This capacity leads to the 
possibility of paradoxioal assertions (the Liars paradox-  as 
far as a modification for artificial intelligence is concerned, 
see Cherniavsky /2/. Havel /3/). In the following example, the 
system is ordered to believe a proposition ~8). which is easi- 
ly performed ~9) .  Never the less ,  i f  the at tempt  to be l ieve  a 
propos i t ion  (12) ,  a l thou~l  i t  is"known" to be t rue  (11) .

(7 )  Tom says that the Earth is round. >>> Hm. 
(8) Belleve the proposition which Tom says\[ >>> OK. 
(9) Which property does the Earth have? >>> Roundness. 
(10) Paul says that you do not believe the proposition which 
Paul says. >>> ~hn, 
(11) Is the proposition which Paul says true? >>> Yes. 
(12) Belleve the proposition which Paul says\[ 
>>> Sorry I cannote 
Not_._~es In this example, to "believe" is interpreted in such a 
way that the system "believes" a proposition by actual stor- 
ing its ~epresentatlon. Thus, the positive answer to question 
(11) does not imply that the system "believes" the proposit- 
ion. Diverse interpretations of "believe" are possibleo 
The "the" in (8), (10) - (12) is interpreted locally, 
i.e. in the context of the knowledge base of the system. Thus, 
if the system knows only one of the propositions which Tom 
says, then this proposition is th..~e proposition which Tom sayse 
The problem of anal~sls of language expressions (i.e. 
of  determin ing  the const ruc t ions  expressed by them) i s  not 
the main goa l  of  our research ,  Never the less ,  a res t r i c ted  sub-  
se t  of sc ient i f i c  Eng l i sh  (see  sentence  (5) above) has been 
descr ibed  by a grammar, which i s  "a lmost  SLR(O)". (The s tack  
automaton accept ing  the l~u6uage has some s ta tes  wi th  sh i f~-  
- reduce  and/or  reduce- reduce  conf l i c t s . )  The ana lyzer  g ives  
a l l  poss ib le  ana lyses  of the  input  sentence ,  tak ing  in to  
account both the  ambigu i t ies  of  the syntact i c  s t ruc ture  of  
the sentence and the  ambigu i t ies  of  the ind iv idua l  words. The 
second case i s  i l l us t ra ted  by the fo l low ing  example: 
(13) John has a ba l lv  
(14) John has every  good proper ty  which Paul has.  
(15) John has a bro ther ,  
The sentences  can be rephrased  as 
(13") John owns a ball. 
- 71  - 
(14" )  John inetant ia tes  every  good proper ty  which Paul 
Inst antlat es. 
(15")  There i s  x such that  x i s  a b ro ther  of  John.  
The word "have" in  (13) and (14) denotes  the ob jec ts  
( i .e .  re la t ions )  denoted by "own" and " ins tant ia te"  in  (13") 
and (14"), respectively. (The relation in (15") is dlffloult 
to  denote by a s ing le  word.)  Thus, the ana lyses  of  sentences  
(13) - (15) are :  
(13-) Aw.Some ~x.And \[\[ Ball w\] x\] ? \[ Own w\] John X 
(14") ~w.Every x p.Oond 
\[And \ [P roper ty  p\] . And \[\[ Good w\] p\] . 
\ [ Ins tant ia te  w \] Paul p \]. \[ Ins tant la te  w \] John p 
(15 w) ~w.Some ~ x.  \[ B ro ther  w\] x John 
Notes The in fo rmat ion  of  the d i f fe rent  ana lyses  of  "have" has 
%o be s tored  in  the d ic t ionary .  Here,  to  own i s  a re la t ion  
between ind iv idua ls ,  to  ins tant ia te  i s  a re la t ion  between an 
ind iv idua l  and a proper ty ,  and in  (15) and (15" ) ,  a re la t io~ 
between an ind iv idua l  and a re la t ion  i s  mentioned (s ince  
brotherhood i s  a re la t ion  between ind iv idua ls ) .  Thus, ambigui -  
t ies  of  th i s  sor t  may be reso lved  by examining,  whether the 
type of  the denoted ob jec t  " f i t s "  in to  the types  of  ob jec ts  
denoted by o ther  words in  the sentence .  
The s~stem i s  bein~ programmed in  7.7SP and the cur rent  
vers ion  has some 2500 l ines  of  source code.  The quoted examp- 
les  ( inc lud ing  the in fe rence  of answers (1) - (12) )have been 
processed  by the system. 
The aim of the present  paper i s  to  demonstrate  that  TIL
