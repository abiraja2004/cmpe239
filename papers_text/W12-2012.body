Abstract 
In this paper we present a new spell-checking 
system that utilizes contextual information for 
automatic correction of non-word misspel-
lings. The system is evaluated with a large 
corpus of essays written by native and non-
native speakers of English to the writing 
prompts of high-stakes standardized tests 
(TOEFL? and GRE?). We also present com-
parative evaluations with Aspell and the spel-
ler from Microsoft Office 2007. Using 
context-informed re-ranking of candidate sug-
gestions, our system exhibits superior error-
correction results overall and also corrects er-
rors generated by non-native English writers 
with almost same rate of success as it does for 
writers who are native English speakers. 
1 Introduction 
Misspellings are ubiquitous in student writing. 
Connors and Lunsford (1988) have found that spel-
ling errors accounted for about one quarter of all 
errors found in a random sample of 300 student 
essays. Desmet and Balthazor (2006) found that 
spelling errors are among the five most frequent 
errors in first-year college composition of US stu-
dents. Lunsford and Lunsford (2008) found that 
spelling errors constituted about 6.5% of all errors 
found in a US national sample of 3000 college 
composition essays, despite the fact that writers 
had access to spellcheckers. 
Misspellings are even more ubiquitous in texts 
written by non-native speakers of English, espe-
cially English Language Learners (ELL). The 
types of misspellings produced by L2 writers are 
typically different from errors produced by native 
speakers (Hovermale, 2010; Al-Jarf, 2010; Okada, 
2005). 
In the area of automatic assessment of writing, 
detection of misspellings is utilized in computer-
aided language learning applications and in some 
automatic scoring systems, especially when feed-
back to users is involved (Dikli, 2006; Warschauer 
and Ware, 2006). Yet spelling errors may have a 
deeper influence on automated text assessment. As 
noted by Nagata, et al. (2011), sub-optimal auto-
matic detection of grammar and mechanics errors 
may be attributed to poor performance of NLP 
tools over noisy text. 
Presence of spelling errors also hinders systems 
that require only lexical analysis of text (Landauer, 
et al. , 2003; P?rez, et al., 2004). Granger and 
Wynne (1999) have shown that spelling errors can 
affect automated estimates of lexical variation, 
which in turn are used as predictors of text quality 
(Crossley, et al., 2008; Yu, 2010). In the context of 
automated preposition and determiner error correc-
tion in L2 English, De Felice and Pulman (2008) 
noted that the process is often disrupted by miss-
pellings. Futagi (2010) described how misspellings 
pose problems in development of a tool for detec-
tion of phraseological collocation errors. 
Given this state of affairs, it is only natural for 
automatic text assessment systems to utilize auto-
matic spellchecking components. However, gener-
ic spellcheckers are typically oriented for errors 
produced by writers who are native speakers of a 
language. Rimrott and Heift (2008, 2005) have 
demonstrated that a generic speller has poor per-
formance on data from German language learners. 
105
Bestgen and Granger (2011) and Hovermale 
(2010) have demonstrated similar results on data 
from ELL. 
Many researchers have suggested that spell-
checkers for L2 users need to be adapted for the 
particular patterns of errors that characterize each 
native language (L1), by studying patterns of inter-
ference and influence from L1 to L2 (Mitton and 
Okada, 2007; Mitton, 1996; Rimrott and Heift, 
2008, 2005; Bestgen and Granger, 2011; Hover-
male, 2010). We have set up to explore a different 
path, in the context of automated text assessment. 
Our goal in the present study is to examine to what 
extent detection and automatic correction of non-
word misspellings can be improved by utilizing 
essay context, for data from both native and non-
native English speakers. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 provides a description of the corpus of 
texts and misspellings that was used in this study. 
Section 3 describes the ConSpel automatic spell-
checking system. Section 4 presents results from a 
comparative evaluation of our system, ConSpel, 
the popular Aspell speller and the Microsoft Office 
2007 speller. Section 5 compares our findings with 
some recent studies and discusses implications for 
further development of automatic spell-checking 
systems. 
2 Corpus 
The corpus used in this study is a collection of es-
says, annotated for misspellings by trained annota-
tors. It is developed for evaluation of automatic 
spellcheckers, and for research on patterns of 
misspellings produced by both native English 
speakers and ELL. 
2.1 Texts 
The corpus comprises essays written by exami-
nees on the writing sections of GRE? (Graduate 
Record Examinations) and TOEFL? (Test of Eng-
lish as a Foreign Language) (ETS, 2011a,b). The 
TOEFL test includes two different writing tasks: a 
short opinion essay, on a pre-assigned topic, and a 
summary essay that compares arguments from two 
different sources (both supplied during the test). 
GRE also includes two different writing tasks: one 
is a short argumentative essay taking a position on 
an assigned topic, the other is an essay evaluating 
the soundness of arguments presented in prompt. 
Both tests are delivered on computer (at test cen-
ters around the world and via Internet), always us-
ing the standard English language computer 
keyboard (QWERTY). Editing tools such as a 
spellchecker are not provided in the test-delivery 
software (ETS, 2011a). All writing tasks have time 
constraints. 
In the current phase of the project, the corpus 
includes 3000 essays, for a total of 963,428 words. 
The essays were selected equally from the two 
tests (4 tasks, 10 prompts per task, 75 essays per 
prompt), also covering full range of scores (as a 
proxy for English proficiency levels) for each task. 
The majority of essays in this collection were writ-
ten by examinees for whom English is not the first 
language (98.73% of TOEFL essays, 57.86% of 
GRE essays). 
2.2 Annotation 
Each text was independently reviewed by two 
annotators, who are native English speakers expe-
rienced in linguistic annotation. Annotators were 
asked to identify all non-word misspellings and 
provide the adequate correction for each one. Inter-
annotator agreement was quite high - annotators 
agreed in 82.6% of the cases (Cohen?s Kappa=0.8, 
p<.001). All disagreements were resolved by a 
third annotator (adjudicator). For details of the an-
notation procedure, see Flor and Futagi (2011).  
The Annotation Scheme for this project provides 
three classes of misspellings, as summarized in 
Table 1. Classification of annotated misspellings 
was automatic. 
 
Type Description Count in corpus 
1 single token non-word  
(e.g. ?businees?, ?inthe?) 
21,160
2 single token non-word for which no 
plausible correction was found 
52
3 multi-token non-word misspelling  
(e.g. ?mor efun? for ?more fun?) 
383
 Total 21,595

The annotation effort focused specifically on 
misspellings, rather than on a wider category of 
orthographic errors in general. The annotation ig-
nored repeated words, missing spaces1 and impro-
per capitalization. Many of the essays have 
inconsistent capitalization and essays written fully 
in capital letters are not uncommon (not only in 
our corpus). In addition, different spelling variants 
were acceptable. This consideration stems from the 
international nature of the two tests ? the exami-
nees come from all around the world, being accus-
tomed to either British, American, or some other 
English spelling standard; so, it is only fair to ac-
cept all of them. 
Overall, the annotated corpus of 3,000 essays 
has the following statistics. Average essay length is 
321 words (the range is 28-798 words). 148 essays 
turned out to have no misspellings at all. Total 
spelling error counts are given in Table 1; 2.24% 
of the words in the corpus are non-word misspel-
lings. 
3 Spelling correction systems 
3.1 Background 
Classic approaches to the problem of spelling cor-
rection of non-word errors were reviewed by Ku-
kich (1992). The typical approach for error 
detection is using good spelling dictionaries. The 
typical approach for correction of non-word errors 
is to include modules for computing edit distance 
(Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966) and phonetic 
similarity. These are used for ranking suggestions 
by their orthographic and phonetic similarity to the 
misspelled word. A more recent feature utilizes 
word frequency data for candidate ranking. Mitton 
(2009) and Deorowicz and Ciura (2005) describe 
state of the art approaches to non-word correction 
without contextual information.  
The use of context for spelling correction was 
initially proposed by Mayes, et al. (1991) only for 
?contextual spelling? ? correcting real-word errors 
(e.g. writing ?fig? instead of ?fog?). A common 
strategy for this task is using pre-defined confusion 
sets, which makes it more amenable to classifier-
based approaches (Golding and Roth, 1999). Sev-
                                                          
1 Annotation ignored missing spaces around punctuation (e.g. 
?chairs,tables?, but all cases where missing spaces result in 
fused words were marked in annotation (e.g. ?inthe?). 
eral recent studies used a web-scale language mod-
el (Google Web1T n-gram corpus ? Brants and 
Franz, 2006) for ?context-sensitive? (i.e. real-
words) spelling correction (Bergsma, et al., 2009; 
Islam and Inkpen, 2009; Carlson and Fette, 2007). 
Chen, et al. (2007) used a LM for pruning candi-
date corrections for non-words in web queries. 
Whitelaw, et al. (2009) used a LM for correcting 
non-word and real-word errors without a dictionary 
and using a statistically trained error model. Our 
study extends the use of language models to auto-
matic correction of non-word errors, with a dictio-
nary, but without any explicit error model. 
3.2 ConSpel system 
The ConSpel system was designed and imple-
mented as a fully automatic system for detection 
and correction of spelling errors. The current ver-
sion is focused on non-word misspellings. The sys-
tem has two intended uses. One is to serve as a 
component in NLP systems for automatic evalua-
tion of student essays. The other use is to facilitate 
automation for research on patterns of misspellings 
in ELL essays. 
In ConSpel, detection policy is quite simple. A 
token in a text is potentially a misspelling if the 
string is not in the system dictionaries. A text may 
include some non-dictionary tokens that systemati-
cally are not misspellings. ConSpel has several 
parameterized options to handle such cases. By 
default, the system will ignore numbers, dates, web 
and email addresses, and mixed alpha-numeric 
strings (e.g. ?RV400?). The system can be in-
structed to ignore capitalized words (e.g. ?Lon-
don?) and/or words in all uppercase (e.g. ?ROME?). 
ConSpel spelling dictionaries include about 
360,000 entries. The core set includes 245,000 en-
tries, providing a comprehensive coverage of mod-
ern English vocabulary. This lexicon includes all 
inflectional variants for a given word (e.g. ?love?, 
?loved?, ?loves?, ?loving?), and international spel-
ling variants (e.g. American and British English). 
Additional dictionaries include about 120,000 en-
tries for international surnames and first names, 
and names for geographical places. 
Dictionaries are also the source of suggested 
corrections. Candidate suggestions for each de-
tected misspelling are generated by returning all 
dictionary words that have an edit distance up to a 
given threshold. With the default threshold of 5, a 
107
misspelling can easily get hundreds of correction 
candidates. Since ConSpel is intended to work on 
ELL data, and ELL misspellings can be quite dis-
similar from the intended words, starting with a 
large number of candidates is a deliberate strategy 
to ensure that the adequate correction will be in-
cluded in the candidate set. Candidates are pruned 
during the re-ranking process, so that only a few 
candidates from the initial set survive to the final 
decision making stage. 
Candidate suggestions for each detected miss-
pelling are ranked using a set of algorithms. An 
edit distance module is used to compute ortho-
graphic similarity between each candidate and the 
original misspelling. Phonetic similarity is com-
puted using the Double Metaphone algorithm (Phi-
lips, 2000). Word frequency is computed for each 
candidate using a very large word-frequency data 
source. 
The main thrust of our new spelling correction 
system is the conjecture that non-word misspel-
lings can be corrected better when their context is 
taken into account.  
Local context (several words around the miss-
pelled word in the text) provides lots of informa-
tion for choosing the adequate correction. For each 
candidate, we check the frequency of its co-
occurrence (in a language model) with the adjacent 
words in the text. This approach borrows from the 
family of noisy-channel error-correction models 
(Zhang, et al., 2006; Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; 
Kernigham, et al., 1990). With the advent of very 
large word n-gram language models, we can utilize 
large contexts (about 4 words on each side of a 
misspelling). Our current language model uses a 
filtered version of the Google Web1T collection, 
containing 1,881,244,352 n-gram types of size 1-5, 
with punctuation included.2 Notably, ConSpel does 
not use any statistical error model. 
A second context-sensitive algorithm utilizes 
non-local context in the essay. The idea is quite 
simple ? given a misspelled token in a text and a 
set of correction-candidates for that word, for each 
candidate we check whether that candidate string 
occurs elsewhere in the text. Since content words 
have some tendency of recurrence in same text, the 
                                                          
2 ConSpel system uses the TrendStream n-gram compression 
software library (Flor, 2012) for fast and memory efficient 
retrieval of n-gram data. As a result, the ConSpel system runs 
even on modest hardware (e.g. a 4GB RAM laptop), concur-
rently with other applications. 
misspelled token might be such a case, and the 
candidate should be strengthened. The idea is 
somewhat similar to cache-based language model 
adaptation (Kuhn and De Mori, 1990), though 
there are considerable differences. First, our sys-
tem looks not only in preceding context, but over 
the whole essay text. Second, and unique to our 
system, ConSpel looks not only in the text, but also 
into the k-best candidate correction lists of the oth-
er misspelled words. Thus, if a word is systemati-
cally misspelled in a document, ConSpel will 
strengthen a candidate correction that appears as a 
candidate for multiple misspelled instances.3  
For each misspelling found in a text, each algo-
rithm produces ranking scores for each candidate. 
We use a linear-weighted ensemble method to 
combine scores from different algorithms. First, 
scores for all candidates of a given misspelling are 
normalized into a 0-1 range, separately for each 
ranker. Normalized scores are then summed using 
a set of constant weights.4  
The ConSpel system is implemented as a flexi-
ble configurable system. Configuration settings 
include choice of dictionaries, choice of algorithms 
and weights for computing the final ranking, and 
choice of the output formats. 
4 Comparative evaluation 
In this section we report the results of evaluation 
on data from our gold-standard corpus of 3,000 
essays described in section 2. This evaluation fo-
cuses on detection and correction of the 21,212 
single-token non-word misspellings (types 1 and 2 
in Table 1) as well as false alarms raised by spell-
checkers.  
Evaluation included three systems. In addition to 
ConSpel, we tested Aspell (version 0.60.6), a pop-
ular open-source spell checking library (Atkinson, 
2011). The third system is spellchecker included in 
Microsoft Office 2007 (hereafter ?MS Word?). 
All evaluations were performed ?in full context? 
(rather than word-by-word) ? each essay in the 
corpus was submitted to each system separately, as 
a simple text file. All evaluations used standard 
                                                          
3 A detailed comparative study of different context utilization 
methods is under way.  
4 The current weights were found experimentally, prior to the 
annotation effort described in this article. We intend to use 
machine learning methods in future research, using the anno-
tated corpus for this purpose.

measures of recall, precision and F-score (Leacock, 
et al., 2010).  
Evaluations for Aspell and MS Word were con-
ducted twice ? once with their original dictiona-
ries5 and once with the ConSpel spelling dictionary 
of about 360,000 word forms. Evaluations where 
Aspell and MS Word were bundled with ConSpel 
dictionary are marked below as Aspell+ and MS 
Word+. 
4.1 Error Detection 
Detection results for non-word misspellings are 
presented in Table 2. All systems show very strong 
recall rates, above 99%. There is more variability 
when precision of error detection is concerned. 
Both MS Word and Aspell benefit from using the 
larger dictionary ? they raise much less false 
alarms than with original dictionaries (Aspell im-
proves precision by about 4% and MS Word by 
about 6%). ConSpel shows best precision, the dif-
ference with second-best (MS Word+) is statisti-
cally significant at p<.01. 
 
System Recall Precision F-score 
Aspell 99.45 86.66 92.62
Aspell+ 99.14 90.92 94.85
ConSpel 99.40 98.43 98.91
MS Word 99.55 90.26 94.68
MS Word+ 99.32 96.16 97.71
 
Table 2. Evaluation results: non-word error detection 
4.2 Error Correction 
For evaluating spelling correction, we again use 
the measures of recall, precision and F-score. Note 
that precision of error correction is defined as pro-
portion of adequately corrected misspellings out of 
total number of misspellings that a system tried to 
correct (this excludes cases missed in detection). 
We conducted error-correction evaluations with 
ConSpel in two variants. The baseline variant, 
ConSpel-A, ranks candidate suggestions using edit 
distance, phonetic similarity and word-frequency. 
                                                          
5 Notably, both Aspell and MS Word in this evaluation came 
with respective default dictionaries for US spelling, and gen-
erated many false alarms when flagging words that are British 
and other international spelling variants. Such false alarm 
cases were discounted from the evaluation statistics. 
The contextual variant, ConSpel-B, adds contex-
tual information in the ranking process. 
Results of error-correction evaluations are 
shown in Table 3. While MS Word speller pro-
vided the adequate correction (top ranked sugges-
tion) in about 73% of annotated cases, its precision 
is only about 67-69%, due to large number of false 
alarms. Aspell has markedly lower accuracy ? both 
in recall and precision. ConSpel-A has approx-
imately same recall as MS-Word, but better preci-
sion (due to low rate of false alarms). ConSpel-B, 
which uses contextual information in ranking can-
didate suggestions, shows markedly better recall 
and precision than either ConSpel-A or MS Word 
(statistically significant at p<.01). 
For Aspell, use of the larger spelling dictionary 
improved detection precision (fewer false alarms ? 
see Table 2), but it has led to degradation in error 
correction ? as shown in Table 3 (possibly ranking 
of candidates is affected by larger dictionaries). 
 
System Recall Precision F-score 
Aspell 61.53 53.62 57.30
Aspell+ 54.17 49.68 51.83
ConSpel-A 72.65 71.94 72.29
ConSpel-B 78.32 77.55 77.93
MS Word 73.34 66.49 69.74
MS Word+ 71.71 69.44 70.56
 
Table 3. Evaluation results: non-word error correction  
(top ranked candidates only) 
 
An additional way to evaluate automatic spel-
ling correction is to consider how often the ade-
quate target correction is found among the k-best 
of the candidate suggestions (Mitton, 2009; Brill 
and Moore, 2000). Figure 1 shows error-correction 
recall and precision results for four systems6 using 
k-best values 1-5 and 10.  
When two-or-more best-ranked candidates are 
considered for each misspelling, the baseline Con-
Spel-A system shows better performance than MS 
Word. Aspell results lag significantly below the 
other systems, although it catches up with MS-
Word beyond k=5. ConSpel-B system outperforms 
all other systems, in both recall and precision. It 
                                                          
6 ?MS Word? and ?MS Word+? overlap for all values of k, 
except for k=1, thus only ?MS Word? is shown in Figure 1.

places the target correction among the top two 
candidates in 88% of cases, and among top three or 
more candidates in beyond 90% of cases.

4.3 Evaluation with data from native and 
non-native English speakers 
In this section we report the results of spell-check 
evaluation with data breakdown by native and non-
native English speakers. Out of 21,212 single-
token non-word misspellings in our corpus, 2,859 
came from 570 essays written by native English 
speakers (NS) and 18,353 misspellings came from 
2,282 essays written by test-takers who are not na-
tive speakers of English (NNS). 
Comparison of error-detection for five systems 
is presented in Table 4. All systems show very 
strong recall results for both types of populations 
(all values are above 99%). The results are a bit 
different for error-detection precision. ConSpel 
achieves best results in both populations (the dif-
ferences with second-best, MS Word+, are statisti-
cally significant at p<.01). MS Word has precision 
around 91%, approximately same in both popula-
tions. Compared to MS Word, MS Word+ has bet-
ter recall rates, in both populations ? due to a 
larger dictionary, it raises much less false alarms. 
Aspell lags behind in this comparison. Using a 
larger dictionary helps, as Aspell+ precision is bet-
ter than that of Aspell in both populations; im-
provement is manifest for NNS data and only 2% 
for NS data. Aspell detection precision on NS data 
(77%) is lower than its precision on NNS data 
(88%). This may be due to Aspell having a prob-
lem with possessive forms (80% of the false alarms 
on NS data are possessives, but only 70% for NNS 
data).7

Results of error-correction recall, with k-best le-
vels 1-5 and 10, are presented in Figure 2. In com-
parisons of recall, with k=1, on NS data (right 
panel), MS Word (81.3%) and ConSpel-B (80.7%) 
show best results (the difference is not significant). 
For larger k-values, MS Word correction rate8 im-
proves to a ceiling of about 88.5% and both Con-
Spel variants have better improvement than MS 
Word. The context-informed ConSpel-B system 
has error-correction recall above 90% for k?2 and 
reaches 94.2% at k=5. 
On NNS data, ConSpel-B has a clear advantage 
over all other systems. At k=1, ConSpel-A and MS 
Word show equal correction performance (72%). 
For k ?2, ConSpel-A shows constant improvement, 
while MS Word improves to a ceiling of about 
85%. For both NS and NNS populations, Aspell 
error-correction performance lags considerably 
behind the other systems, although it catches up 
with and even outperforms MS Word for k?3. Inte-
restingly, Aspell+ performs consistently worse 
than Aspell; the larger dictionary has detrimental 
effect on error-correction for Aspell, but not for 
MS Word.

Figure 2. Error-correction recall for five systems, data 
from native (ns) and non-native (nns) English speakers. 
 
Error-correction precision results are shown in 
Figure 3. Overall, ConSpel-B outperforms all other 
systems, for both NS and NNS populations. On NS 
data, for k=1, MS Word+ (77%), ConSpel-A 
(76%) and MS Word (75%) are very close. For 
k?2, ConSpel-A shows better improvement, reach-
ing 89.4% at k=5, while MS Word+ reaches a ceil-
ing of about 85% (81% for MS Word). Aspell 
performance lags clearly behind the other systems, 
although it also improves considerably with larger 
k-values. For NNS data, the separation between 
systems is even clearer. Aspell lags behind, al-
though it catches up to MS Word at k?5. 
Except for ConSpel-B, all systems have mani-
festly better error-correction precision on NS data 
than on NNS data ? misspellings made by non-
native English speakers are harder to correct. Con-
Spel-B, with context-informed ranking of spelling 
suggestions, performs almost equally well for both 
populations. For k=1, its error-correction precision 
is 77.5% for NNS data and 78% for NS data. For 
k=2, precision is 87.9% for NNS and 88.2% for NS 
data. These differences are not statistically signifi-
cant. For both populations, precision rises beyond 
90% for k?3. ConSpel-B also shows remarkably 
close error-correction recall in both populations: at 
k=1, recall is 77.9% for NNS and 80.7% for NS; at 
k=2, recall is 88.4% for NNS, 91.4% for NS (the 
differences are statistically significant). For k?3, 
recall is beyond 90% for both populations, with 
about 2% advantage for NS population.

Table 5 presents F-scores for error-correction 
evaluation results, for six systems, for k-best val-
ues 1-5 and 10, for NS and NNS data. For each 
value of k, the ConSpel-B system has best values 
for both NS and NNS data. For each cell in Table 
5, we calculated the absolute difference between 
the NS and NNS F-scores. The results are shown in 
Figure 4. Except for ConSpel-B, all systems have 
marked differences in performance on NS and 
NNS data. The differences tend to diminish for 
larger k-values. ConSpel-B is the only system for 
which the differences in error-correction between 
NS and NNS data are consistently below 2%, even 
for k=1.

A question we need to address is whether there 
are any real differences in misspellings produced 
by NS and NNS writers in our corpus. Our initial 
analyses show that there are some distinguishing 
characteristics. 
One characterization is obtained when we look 
at the ?complexity? of the error, defining it as the 
edit distance between misspelling and correct 
word. The data is presented in Table 6. Native 
English speakers make significantly more simple 
errors (edit distance 1) than non-native speakers, 
while the latter make more complex errors (edit 
distance 4+). 
 
Edit distance between  
misspelling and correct form NS NNS 
1 83.3% *79.9%
2 13.0% 14.0%
3 3.1% 3.9%
4+ 0.6% *2.1%

by edit distance to correct word,  
for native and non-native populations. 
* difference significant at p<.01 
 
Another difference we found in our data is the 
length (number of characters) of the correct word 
that was misspelled, for each population (Figure 
5). For words of length 2 to 7, non-native speakers 
produce relatively more misspellings than native 
speakers. For words of length 8 and longer, native 
speakers produce relatively more misspellings than 
non-native speakers. 
ConSpel-B performs about the same on NS and 
NNS data, and better than the other systems. Given 
the above differences of NS and NNS misspellings 
in our corpus, and given that all evaluated systems, 
except ConSpel-B, show better correction on NS 
data, we conclude that ConSpel-B shows this real 
advantage due to utilization of contextual data.

5 Discussion 
Large scale comparative studies of spellchecker 
performance on data from non-native language 
speakers are scarce, possibly due to large amount 
of effort required for expert annotation of data. 
Hovermale (2010) analyzed 500 spelling errors 
from a corpus of essays produced by ELL in Japan. 
In that study, MS Word 2007 successfully cor-
rected 72% of non-word errors, while Aspell had a 
success rate of 81% (presumably at k=1). In our 
study, with data from an international sample of 
non-native English speakers, Aspell error-
correction precision rate is only 52% at k=1, and 
rises to 78% for k=5. MS Word and ConSpel-A 
(no-context) begin with precision of about 75-77% 
at k=1. At k=5, MS Word improves to about 85%, 
and ConSpel-A to above 89%.  
Bestgen and Granger (2011) analyzed 222 ar-
gumentative essays from the ICLE corpus (Gran-
ger et al., 2009), written by European EFL students 
across different levels of English proficiency. 
Their sample included about 150,000 words and 
had 1,549 spelling errors. This amounts to spel-
112
ling-error rate of about 1%, compared to 2.2% in 
our data. In that study, MS Word 2007 had detec-
tion recall of 80.43%, and detection precision of 
82.35%. In our study, MS Word had 99.6% recall 
and 90.1% precision in error detection. The differ-
ence may be attributed to the fact that we focus on 
single-token non-word misspellings, while Bestgen 
and Granger included other categories, specifically 
multi-token errors. Error-correction recall was 71% 
and precision 59% (at k=1). In our study, at k=1, 
MS Word achieved 72% recall and 65% precision, 
which is quite close to the above figures. 
Given that our context-informed system has er-
ror-correction F-score of 77.9% at k=1, and 91.8% 
at k=5, it is obvious that the system picks up the 
right corrections. There is a potential for improve-
ment, possibly by better ranking. Why doesn?t the 
context help even more? Could the system perform 
with 90% at k=1? We have tentatively identified 
three major types of influences that detract the sys-
tem from better performance. Those are a) local 
error density; b) poor grammar; and c) competition 
among inflectional variants. Local error density 
means simply that adjacent words are misspelled 
so there is not enough reliable context to use n-
grams in such cases. 
Poor grammar is also problematic for n-gram-
based approach. In a fragment ?If docter want to 
operate, he...?, the intended word was ?doctor?, but 
?doctor want? is a subject-verb agreement error, 
which is not frequent in the normative n-gram data. 
Thus, under n-gram frequency influence, the sys-
tem prefers ?doctors? as top ranked candidate. 
There is competition of inflectional variants in 
presence of grammatical errors. 
We have observed that even in absence of 
grammatical errors, sometimes an inadequate top 
ranked candidate is an inflectional variant of the 
adequate correction. For example: ?They received 
fresh air, interacte with other youth their age, solved 
problems...?. The adequate correction is 'interacted', 
but ConSpel ranks it third, while 'interacts' comes 
second and 'interact' is ranked first. Notably, non-
local context is not always beneficial ? for a exam-
ple, the presence of word 'interact' elsewhere in the 
essay will strengthen the wrong candidate. Possi-
bly, additional linguistic information could help 
improve ranking in such cases, e.g. by observing 
that all verbs in this sentence come in past tense. 
Mitton (1996) suggested that it should be possi-
ble to adapt a spellchecker to cope specifically 
with L1-characteristic errors of English learners. 
Granger and Wynne (1999) analyzed misspellings 
produced by students with several different L1 
backgrounds and have also suggested that it might 
be ?useful to adapt tools such as spellcheckers to 
the needs of non-native users.? Mitton and Okada 
(2007) have demonstrated a successful adaptation 
of a spellchecker (oriented for native English 
speakers) to Japanese learners of English.9 Howev-
er, adaptation to each specific L1 would require 
considerable resources. As noted by Hovermale 
(2010), it is not clear whether it is worthwhile to 
customize spellchecker heuristics for each learner 
population or better to just have one ELL spell-
checker. Results from our study indicate that it is at 
least feasible to produce a general-purpose spell-
checker that can successfully correct misspellings 
produced by non-native English speakers, almost 
as well as it does for native English speakers. A 
key for such development is utilization of essay 
context for re-ranking of spelling suggestions.  
6 Conclusions 
In this paper we presented a method for context-
informed correction of single-token non-word spel-
ling errors. Our results with ConSpel system dem-
onstrate that utilizing contextual information helps 
improve automatic correction of non-word miss-
pellings, for both native and non-native speakers of 
English, at least for essays written by test takers on 
standardized English proficiency tests. In future 
work we intend to produce a detailed study of the 
different ways of context utilization. We also in-
tend to expand the system to handle multi-word 
spelling errors.

modeling to improve a speller that uses just an orthographic 
error-model. Her combined system achieved 65% correction 
precision at k=1, and 82.6% at k=5. Our context-informed 
system achieves 77.5% and 91.4% respectively.
