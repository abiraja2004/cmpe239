Abstract 
We report on an empirical study of a multiparty 
turn-taking model for physically situated spo-
ken dialog systems. We present subjective and 
objective performance measures that show how 
the model, supported with a basic set of sensory 
competencies and turn-taking policies, can en-
able interactions with multiple participants in a 
collaborative task setting. The analysis brings 
to the fore several phenomena and frames chal-
lenges for managing multiparty turn taking in 
physically situated interaction.  
1. Introduction 
Effective dialog relies on the coordination of con-
tributions by participants in a conversation via turn 
taking. The complexity of understanding and man-
aging turns grows significantly in moving from 
dyadic to multiparty settings, including situations 
where groups of people converse as they collabo-
rate on shared goals. We are exploring computa-
tional methods that can endow dialog systems with 
the ability to participate in a natural, fluid manner 
in conversations involving several people.  
In Bohus and Horvitz (2010a), we presented a 
computational model for managing multiparty turn 
taking. The model harnesses multisensory percep-
tion and reasoning and includes a set of compo-
nents and representations.  These include methods 
for tracking multiparty conversational dynamics, 
for making turn-taking decisions, and for rendering 
decisions about turns into an appropriate set of 
low-level, coordinated gaze, gesture and speech 
behaviors. We implemented the model and have 
been testing it in several domains. The investiga-
tions have been aimed at characterizing the sys-
tem?s performance in complex multiparty settings.  
In Bohus and Horvitz (2010b), we examine data 
collected during a user study to evaluate the ability 
of the system to shape the flow of multiparty con-
versational dynamics.  In this paper, we focus our 
attention on the performance of the inference and 
decision-making models.  We analyze the accuracy 
of current turn-taking inferences, the influence of 
inference errors on decisions, and the overall effec-
tiveness of the system?s decision making. We re-
port on subjective and objective measures of the 
system?s turn-taking performance. We find that the 
turn-taking methodology enables our system to 
successfully participate in multiparty interactions, 
even when relying on relatively coarse models for 
inference and decision making.  The analysis high-
lights several general phenomena including stand-
ing bottlenecks and difficulties, and opportunities 
for enhancing multiparty turn taking in dialog sys-
tems. Based on the results, we discuss challenges 
and directions for research on turn taking in physi-
cally situated dialog.   
2. Related Work 
We begin by placing this work within the larger 
context of research on multiparty interaction and 
turn taking. In a seminal paper on turn taking in 
natural conversations, Sacks, Schegloff and Jeffer-
son (1974) proposed a basic model for the organi-
98
zation of turns in conversation. The model is cen-
tered on the notion of turn-constructional-units, 
separated by transition relevance places that pro-
vide opportunities for speaker changes. In later 
work, Schegloff (2000) elaborates on several as-
pects of this model, including interruptions and 
overlap resolution devices. Other researchers in 
conversational analysis and psycho-linguistics 
have highlighted the important role played by gaze, 
gesture, and other non-verbal communication 
channels in regulating turn taking. For instance, 
Duncan (1972) discusses the role of non-verbal 
signals, and proposes that turn taking is mediated 
via a set of verbal and non-verbal cues. Wiemann 
and Knapp (1975) survey prior investigations on 
turn-taking cues in several conversational settings, 
in an effort to elucidate differences. Goodwin 
(1980) discusses various aspects of the relationship 
between turn taking and attention. More recently, 
Hjalmarsson (2011) investigates the additive effect 
turn-taking cues have on listeners in both human 
and synthetic voices.

Within the dialog systems community, efforts 
have been made on designing and implementing 
computational models for managing turn taking 
(e.g., Traum, 1994; Thorriss?n, 2002; Raux and 
Eskenazi, 2009; Selfridge and Heeman, 2010). 
Moving beyond the dyadic setting, Traum and 
Rickel (2002) describe a turn management compo-
nent for supporting dialog between a trainee and 
multiple virtual humans. Kronlid (2006) describes 
a Harel state-chart implementation of the original 
SSJ model. Researchers studying human-robot in-
teraction have developed prototype robots that can 
interact with multiple human participants (e.g. Ma-
tsusaka et al, 2001; Bennewitz et al, 2005). In our 
previous work Bohus and Horvitz (2009; 2010a; 
2010b), we describe a platform that leverages mul-
timodal perception and reasoning to support multi-
party dialog in open-world settings. 
3. Multiparty Turn-Taking Model 
We engaged in a set of experiments to probe the 
inference and decision making competencies of a 
computational model for multiparty turn taking 
(Bohus and Horvitz 2010a; 2010b). To set the 
stage for the analysis to follow, we briefly review 
the proposed approach. 
We model turn taking as an interactive, collabo-
rative process by which participants in a conversa-
tion monitor one another and take coordinated ac-
tions to ensure that (generally) only one person 
speaks at a given time. The participant ratified to 
speak via this process is said to have the floor. 
Each participant engaged in the interaction con-
tinuously produces (i.e. at every time tick) one of 
four floor management actions: a hold action indi-
cates that a participant is maintaining the floor; a 
release action indicates that the participant is 
yielding the floor to a set of other participants 
(which could be void, allowing for self-selection 
next turn allocation); a take action indicates that 
the participant is trying to acquire the floor; finally, 
a null action indicates that a participant is not mak-
ing any floor claims. The floor shifts from one par-
ticipant to another as the result of the joint, coop-
erative floor management actions taken by the par-
ticipants. Specifically, a release action must be met 
with a take action for a floor shift to occur; in all 
other cases the floor stays with the participant that 
currently holds it.  
Figure 1 illustrates the main components and 
key abstractions in the model. The sensing sub-
component tracks the conversational dynamics, 
and includes models for detecting spoken signals s, 
inferring the source S(s) and the set of addressees 
A(s) for each signal, as well as the floor state 
FS(p), actions FA(p) and intentions FI(p) of each 
participant p engaged in a conversation. This in-
formation is used in conjunction with higher-level 
dialog context to decide when the system should 
generate new contributions and which floor action 
should be produced at each point in time. Finally, 
floor actions are rendered by a behavioral compo-
nent into a set of coordinated gaze, gesture and 
speech behaviors. By harnessing these different 
components, the proposed model can enable an 
99
embodied conversational agent to handle a broad 
spectrum of turn-taking phenomena.

4. User Study 
We implemented an initial set of turn-taking infer-
ence and decision making models in the context of 
a multiparty dialog system, and we conducted a 
large-scale multiparty interaction user study with 
this system. The study, described in more detail 
below, was designed to fulfill two goals: (1) to as-
certain an initial performance baseline and identify 
current bottlenecks and challenges to be addressed 
moving forward, and (2)  to collect a large set of 
multiparty human-computer dialog data that can be 
used to study and improve multiparty turn taking in 
dialog systems.  
4.1. System 
The platform used in these experiments, described 
in detail in Bohus and Horvitz (2009), takes the 
form of a multimodal interactive kiosk that dis-
plays an avatar head which plays a questions game 
with multiple participants. The system leverages 
audiovisual information and employs components 
for visually tracking multiple people in the scene, 
sound source localization, speech recognition, 
conversational scene analysis, behavioral control 
and dialog management. Figure 2 shows a screen 
generated by the system, with the rendered avatar 
and a sample challenge question. Users can col-
laborate on selecting an answer, and, after a con-
firmation, the system provides an explanation if the 
answer is incorrect, before moving on to the next 
question. Sample interactions are found in Appen-
dix C and videos are available online (Situated In-
teraction, 2011). 
4.2. Turn-Taking Inference and Decisions 
In the current system, a voice activity detector is 
used to identify and segment spoken utterances. 
The source of each utterance is assumed to be the 
participant who is closest in the horizontal plane to 
the sound direction identified by the microphone 
array. The set of addressees is identified by fusing 
information probabilistically about the focus of 
attention of the source, as obtained through face 
detection and head pose tracking, while the utter-
ance is being detected. In addition, the system as-
sumes that non-understandings are addressed to 
other engaged participants, since initial tests indi-
cated that in this domain about 80% of utterances 
that led to non-understandings were in fact ad-
dressed to others. Similarly, the system assumes 
that utterances longer than three seconds are ad-
dressed to others (responses addressed to the sys-
tem tend to be short in this domain) 
Floor management actions are inferred as fol-
lows. If a participant has the floor, we assume they 
are performing a hold action if speaking and a re-
lease action otherwise. The release is assumed to 
be towards the addressees of the last spoken utter-
ance. Although the latter assumption on releases 
may not hold in the most general case, it is a rea-
sonable one for the questions game domain. If a 
participant does not have the floor, the system as-
sumes they perform a take action if speaking or a 
null action otherwise. The system also assumes 
that the floor intentions are fully reflected by the 
floor actions, i.e., a participant intends to have the 
floor if and only if she performs a hold or take ac-
tion. Floor states are updated based on the joint, 
coordinated floor actions of all participants, as de-
scribed earlier.  
Turn-taking decisions are based on a simple 
heuristic policy. The system takes the floor if (1) 
the floor is being released to it or (2) a participant 
releases the floor to someone else, but no one 
claims the floor for a preset duration. In most cas-
es, this duration is set to 3.5 seconds. However, if 
the floor is released to someone else after the sys-
tem is interrupted during a question dialog act, the 
system will try to quickly reacquire the floor 
should no one else be speaking, so as to finish or 
restate its question. The waiting duration is set in 
the latter case to 500 milliseconds. If after 500ms, 
when the system tries to take the floor another con-
flict occurs (followed by a floor release to someone 
else), the waiting duration is increased again to 3.5 
seconds. Finally, if a third consecutive conflict oc-
100
curs when the system tries to acquire the floor, the 
waiting duration is set to a longer, 20 seconds. 
The system releases the floor at the end of its 
own outputs. In addition, it has to decide whether it 
should release the floor when a user performs a 
take action (i.e. barges in) while the system is 
speaking. The heuristic policy currently imple-
mented by the system releases the floor only for 
barge-ins occurring during question dialog acts. 
Finally, the behavioral models employ policies 
informed by the existing literature on the role of 
gaze in regulating turn taking. In particular, the 
system?s gaze is directed towards the speaking par-
ticipant, or, if the system is speaking, towards the 
addressees of the system?s utterance. During si-
lences, the system?s gaze is directed towards the 
participants that the floor is being released to. 
The models and policies described above repre-
sent a starting point for inference and action, con-
structed to enable data collection and an initial 
evaluation in this domain. We are working to up-
date the turn-taking architecture with more sophis-
ticated evidential reasoning and utility-theoretic 
decision making.  Nevertheless, when harnessed as 
an ensemble within the turn-taking approach that 
we have described, the current procedures provide 
for an array of complex, multiparty turn-taking 
behaviors. For instance, the system can address 
each participant individually or all participants as a 
group via controlling the orientation of its head 
pose. When participants talk amongst themselves, 
the system can monitor their exchanges and wait 
until the floor is being released back to it. If an 
answer is heard during such a side conversation 
(e.g., one participant suggests an answer to an-
other), the system highlights it on the screen (see 
Figure 2). If a significant pause is detected during 
this side conversation, the avatar takes the floor 
and the initiative, e.g., ?So, what do you think is 
the correct answer?? Once a participant provides 
an answer, the system seeks confirmation from 
another participant before moving on. In some 
cases, the avatar passes back the floor and seeks 
confirmation non-verbally, by simply turning to-
wards another participant and raising its eyebrows. 
The system can try to require the floor immediately 
after being interrupted, but can also back off, giv-
ing the participants a chance to finish a side con-
versation, if successive floor conflicts occur. Sam-
ple interactions can be viewed in Appendix C and 
online (Situated Interaction, 2011). 
4.3. Study Design 
The user study was conducted in a usability lab 
and involved a total of 60 participants recruited as 
pairs of people from the general population who 
previously knew one another (30 male and 30 fe-
male, with ages between 18 and 61). The study 
was structured in 15 one-hour sessions, with each 
session involving four participants, i.e., two pairs 
of two previously acquainted participants. In each 
session, we formed all possible subgroups of size 
two (6 subgroups) and of size three (4 subgroups) 
with the four participants. Each subgroup played 
one game with the system. This setup allowed us to 
collect a large set of multiparty interactions under 
diverse conditions (e.g., all-male, all-female, 
mixed-gender groups; groups where people were 
previously acquainted vs. not, etc.). At the end of 
each session, participants filled in a subjective as-
sessment survey. 
4.4.  Corpus, Annotations, and Cost Assessment 
In total, 150 multiparty interactions were collected: 
90 with two participants and the system, and 60 
with three participants and the system. A profes-
sional annotator transcribed the utterances detected 
by the system at runtime, and labeled them with 
source and addressee information. 
    The system was noted to commit several types 
of turn-taking errors. To expand the error analysis 
beyond occurrence statistics and to characterize the 
impact of various types of errors, we conducted a 
follow-up study.  In this second study, a set of ad-
ditional participants were recruited to review vid-
eos of interactions from the first study and asked to 
(1) identify the turn-taking errors committed by the 
system and (2) to assess the costliness of the error 
on a five-point scale.  
A total of 9 interactions (5 with two participants 
and system; 4 with three participants and system) 
were randomly sampled from the collected corpus, 
while ensuring that each turn-taking outcome of 
interest (discussed in Section 5 and summarized in 
Table 1) was sufficiently represented. Nine partici-
pants were recruited via an email request to em-
ployees at our organization.  Each participant re-
viewed three interactions, and each interaction was 
reviewed by three different participants. Prior to 
the experiment, each of the annotators received a 
brief review of the turn-taking process in human-
human interaction. Next, they used a multimodal 
101
annotation tool that we created to review the inter-
action videos. As each video played, the annotator 
pushed a button at each point they believed that the 
system had committed a turn-taking error. In a se-
cond pass, each annotator was asked to review the 
errors that they had previously identified and to 
assess the relative cost of the error, on a scale from 
0 (?no error?) to 5 (?worst error?). In a final step, 
the authors manually aligned each identified turn-
taking error with a turn-taking decision made by 
the system and its corresponding outcome. 
5. Evaluation 
We now focus on the various types of turn-taking 
errors, the outcomes that these errors lead to, and 
the costs assessed for the outcomes.  We begin by 
focusing on diarization challenges described in 
Section 5.1.  In Sections 5.2 and 5.3, we review the 
accuracy of the system?s turn-taking inferences and 
decisions, and their corresponding outcomes.  Fi-
nally, in Section 5.4, we turn our attention to the 
subjective assessment results obtained via the post-
experiment user survey.  
Before diving into the details, we note that we 
eliminated 7 out of the total 150 interactions from 
the analysis due to significant problems with 
acoustic echo cancellation. In the remaining 143 
interactions, we also identified and eliminated 24 
utterances in the transitional engagement stages, 
e.g., when the users were not ready or properly 
setup in front of the system. The analysis below is 
based on the remaining 4379 utterances.  
5.1. Diarization 
The system uses a voice activity detector which 
leverages energy, acoustics and grammar to detect 
spoken utterances. Our experiments indicate that 
this type of black-box solution can make diariza-
tion errors, especially in multiparty settings where 
people may speak simultaneously, at a fast pace, 
and address each other with language outside the 
system?s grammar. Results show that only 72% of 
the detected segments contain speech from a single 
participant. Another 2% contain background noises 
incorrectly identified as speech. Most often these 
are instances where the system heard itself due to 
acoustic echo-cancellation problems; the ratio 
grows to about 6% among all utterances detected 
while the system is speaking. The remaining 26% 
contain overlapping or successive utterances from 
multiple speakers. Inspection of the data reveals 
that some utterances spoken softly by participants 
were not detected and that segmentation boundary 
errors are also sometimes present. While such er-
rors may be mitigated by inferences at higher lev-
els in the turn-taking model, they can significantly 
influence the system?s ability to track the conver-
sational dynamics and make appropriate turn-
taking decisions. We plan to pursue more robust 
audiovisual diarization methods that integrate 
sound localization as detected by a microphone 
array, along with higher-level interaction context.  
5.2. Take versus Null  
We now turn our attention to the system?s floor 
control decisions. The analysis below is based on 
the utterances and segmentation detected by the 
system at runtime. We note that a more precise 
analysis could be conducted with a ground truth 
segmentation of utterances. Utterances detected by 
the system can be classified into three categories, 
based on their relationship to system outputs, as 
shown in Figure 3: overlaps, which start and end 
during a system?s output, continuers, which begin 
during but finish after a system output has ended, 
and responses, which do not overlap anywhere.   
With the current policy, the system chooses 
whether it should take the floor following each 
detected continuer and response. The dataset con-
tains a total of 3265 such instances. The system?s 
decision at each of these points hinges on the re-
sults of its inferences about the participants? floor 
actions, and thus of inferences about the addressees 
of each utterance. Table 1 displays a tabulation of 
the release actions performed by the participants 
versus the actions identified by the system. The 
release actions are determined from labels assigned 
manually by the professional annotator. Recall that 
we make an assumption that the release is towards 
the set of addressees of an utterance. For segments 
that were labeled as containing multiple utterances, 
the release is made to the addressee of the last ut-
terance. The last row in Table 1 corresponds to 
background noises and system speech incorrectly

identified as utterances.  
On the task of detecting addressees, and thus 
floor release actions, the results show an error rate 
of 18%, including 305 false-positives (erroneous 
detections) and 277 false-negatives (missed detec-
tions) of floor releases to the system. These errors 
influence the quality of turn taking in a variety of 
ways and underscore the need for more robust in-
ferences about speech source and target, and floor 
release actions. We believe that more sophisticated 
models learned from audiovisual information (e.g., 
prosody, head and body pose, etc.) and attributes 
of the interaction context (e.g., who spoke last, 
where is the system looking, etc.) can reduce errors 
significantly. 
Table 1 indicates that in 305 (9%) of the cases 
the system incorrectly inferred that the floor was 
being released to it. In 79% of these cases, the sys-
tem took the floor and produced a verbal contribu-
tion. Since the floor was not released to the system, 
such errors can lead to significant turn-taking prob-
lems, which often manifest as floor conflicts 
marked by turn-initial overlaps, where a partici-
pant and the system start speaking around the same 
time (see Figure 3). Operationally, we define turn-
initial overlaps as all detected overlaps with an 
actual onset of less than 300 milliseconds from the 
beginning of the system?s utterance (see discussion 
in Appendix A); the other overlaps are dubbed 
turn-internal. We note that the time at which an 
overlap is detected by the system lags behind the 
actual onset of the utterance by an average of about 
700 milliseconds, due to core latencies in our audio 
and speech processing pipeline. Accounting for 
these computational lags, and others arising at dif-
ferent places in processing pipelines, raise chal-
lenges for turn taking in spoken dialog systems. 
42% of the verbal takes performed incorrectly 
by the system led to turn-initial overlaps. This is 
not surprising, as the system starts speaking when 
the floor was not released to it. In some of these 
cases the same participant continues (e.g., diariza-
tion errors incorrectly segmented the utterance), or 
someone else starts speaking. The cost assessment 
experiment confirmed the impact of these errors ? 
the average estimated cost was 1.76. If no turn-
initial overlap occurred after the system incorrectly 
took the floor, the average cost was 0.42. Clearly 
103
floor conflicts come with a cost. The specific cost 
assessments we obtained are perhaps influenced to 
a degree by the role of game mediator played by 
the system. With this role, taking the floor in cases 
when the system was not addressed is perhaps not 
as costly as it might be in other domains.  
Note that 182 turn-initial overlaps also occur 
when the system takes the floor after correctly 
identifying that the floor was released to it (upper-
left quadrant in Table 1). 17 of them are created by 
the system hearing itself as it starts speaking, due 
to errors in acoustic echo cancellation; these in-
stances are marked Echo in Table 1. While the rel-
ative percentage of turn-initial overlaps is smaller 
after a floor release to the system (~10%), the ma-
jority of all turn-initial overlaps (shaded cells in 
Table 1) occur in this context, because of the larger 
incidence of the situation. Often, these utterances 
contain an immediate answer or a short confirma-
tion from another participant. The cost of these 
turn-initial overlaps is also much lower: 0.25 ver-
sus 1.76 (again, the cost structure is probably sen-
sitive to details of the domain). 
We believe the turn-initial overlaps that occur 
when the floor is released to the system can be ex-
plained in part by the interpretation of the system?s 
short delay in responding (per processing) as a sig-
nal that the system is not taking the floor, leading 
other participants to take initiative. As another fac-
tor, turn taking is a mixed-initiative process, and 
other participants might vie for the floor and issue 
their own contributions immediately after an an-
swer directed to the system. These observations 
bring to the fore two questions: (1) how can we 
minimize the number of turn-initial overlaps, and 
(2) how can the system gracefully handle such 
overlaps once they occur?  
One approach to minimizing turn-initial over-
laps is to reduce the system?s response delays via 
faster processing or via the use of predictive mod-
els to anticipate the end of turns (e.g. Ferrer et al, 
2003; Schlangen, 2006; Raux and Eskenazi, 2008; 
Skantze and Schlangen, 2009). Multiparty settings 
require methods for forecasting not only when a 
current speaker will finish, but also whether any 
participant will try to take (or release) the floor 
within a small window of time in the future, i.e., 
accurately modeling all floor intentions. Our turn-
taking framework includes components for repre-
senting and modeling floor intentions, but these are 
not used in the current system.  We believe there is 
promise in learning models to predict floor inten-
tions and the timing of ends of utterances from in-
teraction data. The availability of such predictions 
can fuel additional turn-taking strategies and also 
pave the way to more graceful handling of turn-
initial overlaps after they occur. For instance, if the 
system can anticipate that someone else might start 
speaking, it might still decide to take the floor but 
it might start with a filler, e.g., ?So [pause] What 
do you think?? constructing a natural opportunity 
for resolving a potential conflict after ?So? We 
plan to investigate the use of decision-theoretic 
methods to anticipate and resolve such conflicts by 
introducing and modulating an array of strategies, 
including the use of fillers, restarts, and acknowl-
edgment gestures.  
In 21% of the 305 incorrectly detected floor re-
leases to the system, our system immediately per-
formed a non-verbal floor release to another par-
ticipant by turning the avatar?s face towards them 
and raising its eyebrows (Take + Non-verbal Release in 
Table 1). These situations are not costly, as the 
system?s action does not interrupt the flow of the 
conversation. Indeed they were never penalized in 
the cost assessment experiment that we conducted. 
However, the same action, performed when the 
floor is actually released to the system (13% of 
2063 cases), has the potential to create problems if 
not properly recognized by the targeted participant 
as a floor release by the system; the average cost 
assessed in this case was 0.42. 
The right-hand column in Table 1 shows cases 
where the system detected that the floor was not 
released to it. In these cases, the system waits (per-
forms null) for a specified duration. The cost as-
sessment indicates that waiting in this situation is 
overall costly, and the cost depends on the ultimate 
outcome. If no one else takes the floor, the system 
will eventually do so (Delayed System Take cases in 
Table 1). In some of these cases, turn-initial over-
laps also occur. The 277 cases in which the system 
fails to detect that the floor was in fact released to 
it lead to no immediate response from the system. 
In these cases the system can be perceived as unre-
sponsive and the participants eventually repeat 
themselves. We believe that performance can be 
improved with the use of an ongoing decision-
theoretic analysis that continuously reassesses the 
situation while the system waits.  Such an analysis 
would consider the delay, floor holder?s previous 
actions, inferences about participants? floor inten-
104
tions, and cost-benefit tradeoffs of different floor 
actions. 
5.3. Release versus Hold 
We now turn our attention to the system?s deci-
sions to release the floor. Recall that, according to 
the current policy, the system performs a floor hold 
while it is speaking and a floor release at the end of 
its outputs. In addition, if an overlap (i.e., barge-in) 
was detected during question dialog acts, the sys-
tem performed a floor release immediately, inter-
rupting its own output and allowing for the user 
barge-in.  
Since such barge-ins were allowed only during 
the question dialog acts, as Table 2 shows, the cur-
rent policy leads to an abundance of cases in which 
the system performs hold when an overlap is de-
tected. Some of these cases are continuers: the 
overlap only happens at the very end of the sys-
tem?s output. These cases do not create significant 
turn-taking problems, as the floor still transitions to 
the participant relatively quickly (the system re-
leases at the end of its output). However, in a sig-
nificant number of cases the system appears to ig-
nore the participants (shaded cells in Table 2). 
About three quarters of these overlaps occur while 
the system is providing an explanation after an in-
correct answer. Observations of the data indicate 
that in these cases participants may discuss or give 
their opinion on the answer or some aspect of the 
system?s explanation, while ignoring the system as 
it blindly continues the explanation.  
We have separated in Table 2 turn-initial from 
turn-internal overlaps. The two types of overlaps 
reflect different phenomena. As we have discussed, 
turn-initial overlaps mark floor conflicts, and vari-
ous strategies could be used to negotiate such con-
flicts (e.g., Yang and Heeman, 2010). In contrast, 
turn-internal overlaps may reflect efforts by other 
participants to take the floor, or might simply be 
backchannels, laughter, exclamations or other lexi-
cal or non-lexical events that do not mark a claim 
for the floor. Making appropriate floor control de-
cisions in this case will require models for reliably 
distinguishing between the two, i.e., between the 
take or null floor actions of the participants. This is 
an especially challenging inference problem as 
decisions need to be made as early as possible after 
the onset of an utterance.  
We note the relatively large incidence of failures 
in echo cancellation in our microphone array. On 
the utterances marked Echo in Table 2, the system 
heard itself and thought a user was speaking. We 
believe these failures could be significantly re-
duced with better acoustic echo cancellation.  
5.4. Subjective Assessment  
Finally, we present results from a subjective as-
sessment of the system by participants, based on a 
post-experiment survey. The survey included sev-
eral 7-point Likert scale questions related to turn 
taking, which are displayed in Figure 4, together 
with the mean user responses and the correspond-
ing 95% confidence intervals. Generally, partici-
pants rated the system?s turn-taking abilities fa-
vorably, with scores around 4.5-5. No statistically 
significant differences were detected in assess-
ments across the participant?s gender or previous 
familiarity with speech recognition systems. We 
also note that a parallel human?human interaction 
study would help us characterize better the sys-
tem?s performance relative to human dialog.

In addition to the survey questions, participants 
were invited to describe in their own words what 
they liked best and the first thing they would 
change about the system. 21 of the 60 participants 
mentioned aspects of multiparty interaction in the 
?what I liked best? category, such as the system?s 
ability to track the speaking participant and address 
people individually. Other frequent answers to this 
question called out the overall experience with the 
integrative intelligence of the system (15 answers), 
the fun/educational nature of the game (14), and 
aspects of speech recognition (11). On the ?first 
thing you would change,? the majority of answers 
(32) included references to shortcomings in render-
ing the avatar, while 13 answers included refer-
ences to problematic aspects of the multiparty turn 
taking. Other answers included task domain sug-
gestions (6) and comments about improving the 
speech recognition (5). A sampling of answers is 
presented in Appendix B.   
6. Summary and Future Work 
We reported on a user study of a multiparty turn-
taking model. Objective measures of system per-
formance and subjective assessments by partici-
pants indicate that the approach can enable suc-
cessful multiparty turn taking in the questions 
game domain. When the correct turn-taking deci-
sions are made, the multiparty interaction is seam-
less and resembles human-human collaboration. 
The conversations exhibit fluid exchanges among 
people and the system, including mixed-initiative, 
multiparty floor control, fluid back offs and re-
starts, natural use of non-verbal cues, such as par-
ticipants? utterances being triggered by a turn of 
the avatar?s head or a lift of the eyebrows. In con-
trast, turn-taking failures lead to a striking loss of 
fluidity and a qualitative jump out of an engaged 
process, where the system rapidly shifts from a 
collaborating participant into a distant and uncoor-
dinated appliance.  
The results we have discussed are based on an 
initial set of coarse perceptual and decision-making 
models and thus reflect an initial baseline; there is 
significant room for improvements. A careful dis-
section of the outcomes demonstrates the subtleties 
of multiparty turn taking and highlights several 
directions we plan to address in future work. First, 
our experiments have highlighted the importance 
of accurate diarization in multiparty dialog set-
tings. Minimizing errors requires rich perceptual 
and inferential competencies, leveraging audiovis-
ual evidence, general patterns of human discourse, 
and attributes of the task-specific goals and con-
text. We plan to explore the use of machine learn-
ing procedures for constructing predictive models 
that harness richer streams of evidence to identify 
and segment utterances, and to make inferences 
about their sources and targets, and the floor state, 
actions and intentions of all participants. Better 
turn-taking decisions can also be supported by in-
ferences about social norms, roles and dynamics, 
pace of interaction, and engagement.  
Although handcrafted turn-taking policies went 
a long way in this domain, enabling more general 
multiparty turn taking will require continuous in-
ference and decision making under uncertainty that 
considers subtleties of intention and timing, and 
that takes into consideration tradeoffs associated 
with different courses of actions. We foresee the 
value of extending the current decision models 
with richer temporal reasoning for performing such 
ongoing analyses. Challenges include a more in-
depth understanding of the cost of different types 
of turn-taking errors; the development of a wider 
array of graded strategies and behaviors for taking, 
releasing, or holding the floor, and for gracefully 
negotiating floor conflicts; and finally, the ability 
to reason about uncertainty in the world as well as 
in the system?s own processing delays in order to 
resolve tradeoffs between taking timely action and 
delaying for additional evidence that promises to 
enhance the accuracies of decisions. 
Much also remains to be done with the corre-
sponding generation of subtle verbal and non-
verbal cues for enhanced signaling and naturalness 
of conversation, including the use of fillers, re-
starts, backchannels, and envelope feedback. We 
are excited about tackling these and other chal-
lenges on the path to fielding systems that can en-
gage in fluid multiparty dialog.

Appendix A. Details on derivation of operational definition of turn-initial overlaps.  
 
As described in Section 5.2, we operationally define turn-initial overlaps as 
detected user utterances that have an actual onset of less than 0.3 seconds from 
the beginning of a system utterance. Figure 5 shows the histogram of the onset 
time for user speech with respect to system utterances (start of system utter-
ance is at 0 seconds), for overlapping utterances, where this onset is between -
2 and +5 seconds. If multiple user utterances overlap with a single system 
utterance, only the first user utterance, i.e. the first overlap, is considered in 
computing this histogram. As Figure 5 shows, the onset distribution has a bi-
modal character. We believe that the two modes may reflect two different 
phenomena in terms of the floor transition. The early-onset mode corresponds 
to situations in which a user starts to speak right around (before or immedi-
ately after) the time the system also started speaking; this indicates a situation 
where there is contention for the floor and the system cannot assume it has 
successfully acquired the floor. In contrast, user utterances starting at later 
times represent cases where the floor did first transition to the system and the 
user is aware of this transition.  In producing an utterance the user is attempt-
ing to barge-in and take the floor back from the system (unless the user utter-
ance is a backchannel). The threshold of 0.3 seconds on the onset for turn-
initial overlaps was selected based on the shape of this distribution.

- I enjoyed how it recognized who was speaking and actually looked at you 
- I liked how the avatar tracked the players; how it understood speech 
- It was great to play a game where you don?t have to use your hands, just your mind. The way the avatar would recognize 
position of who spoke was nice. The blinking action at the avatar made her more realistic but she needed more than her face.  
- That it would look right at you and ask a question 
- I liked how the avatar made eye contact with each person playing the game?
Overall  
experience 
with system 
15 
- It was very new and thus it was fun. I don?t play computer games often and I did enjoy this one. Which is rare for me.  
- It was different than any other trivia game I?ve played in the past 
- I think this is a great way for a human to interact with a computer?
- It?s cool interacting with the avatar?
Rewarding 
task 14 
- I liked the challenge of the questions 
- It?s a great fun way to improve knowledge 
- New experience that I found enjoyable. I enjoyed thinking about choices and having an interaction with the avatar 
Speech and 
language 11 
- Voice recognition was fairly accurate, no need to repeat 
- The ability of it to understand what I was saying. Plus it?s pretty cool.  
- I liked it because it wasn?t really hard for the system to understand what we were saying. Even though we have an accent. 
If there was one thing you could change about this system, what would it be? 
Avatar  
rendering 32 
- The avatar should be more friendly ? she came off a bit austere ? she didn?t smile even when we got 5 out of 6 questions 
right, it was only ?pretty good?.  
- The way it moves its lips needs to be better 
- The avatar seemed a little to ?stiff?. It needs to be more natural in movement and speech 
- The face was a ?warmer face?. Smiling perhaps. 
Multiparty 
failures 13 
- Extend the time limit when questions haven?t been fully answered. It would sometimes say we were correct or false before we 
had confirmed our answer 
- Sometimes it skips and pauses and making it difficult to understand 
- Consistency in waiting and asking player to confirm answer instead of overhearing conversations and choosing an answer 
itself 
Task domain  6 - It would be cool if it could remember our names. Also, 6 questions was a little short. I think 8 or 10 questions would be better.  - I think the questions should be more pop culture related 
Speech and 
language 5 
- I enjoyed her. I would like her to understand a little easier. We had to repeat answers on occasion which wasn?t too bad. 
Overall I really liked it. Perhaps it could ask our names and call us by name when speaking to us

Appendix C. Excerpts from interactions with the system. We present and discuss two segments from an interaction 
with the questions game system. The segments illustrate challenges for diarization, tracking conversational dynamics (e.g. infer-
ring speech source, target, floor actions, etc.) and decisions making for multiparty turn taking. The video for this entire interac-
tion, as well as an additional interaction are available online at (Situated Interaction, 2011)

This segment starts with the system asking a question 
2 P16?P16 Hospitals have a red cross what sign 
do they user in the Arab World? 
3 P17?S Solid blue circle 
4 S?P16 Is that correct? 
5 P17?S No 
6 S?P16,P17 So what?s the correct answer? 
7 P17?P16 Red crescent moon 
8 P17?S Red crescent moon 
9 S?P16 [turns to P16, lifts eyebrows] 
10 P16?S Yes 
11 S?P16,P17 That?s right. Okay, so far you?re two 
out of three [?] 
P16 echoes back the question to himself in a low voice. The system detects this utterance, cor-
rectly inferred that the floor is not being released to it (the utterance leads to a non-
understanding), and the system turns towards the other participant, which produces ?Solid blue 
circle? (3). The utterance and corresponding floor release to the system are correctly understood, 
and the system turns back to P16 for confirmation. Next, the system detects an utterance from P17, 
who has changed her mind (5). The system takes the floor and asks both participants (by directing 
gaze towards them) what the correct answer is (6), and releases the floor to both participants o. 
P17 speaks first towards P16 (7) ? this utterance is low energy and not detected by the system, and 
then towards the system (8). The system recognizes the floor is released to it after (8), takes the 
floor and directs it back towards P16 non-verbally, by turning towards him and raising eyebrows. 
P16 responds immediately, and the system takes the floor and continues to the next question. 
   
17 S?P16,P17 Next question [?] The system then moves on to the next question

6 S?P16 Here is the first question. The study of 
the size and shape of the skull as an 
indicator of a person?s character is 
known as: telepathy, graphology, or 
phrenology?

8 S?P17 What do you think? 
9 P17?P17 graph- 
10 P16?P17 That doesn?t sound right but 
11 P17?S Phrenology
12 S?P16,P17 I?m sorry but that?s incorrect. Popular 
during the 19th century but not dis-
credited, phrenology is a theory that a 
person?s character and intelligence 
can be determined by the size and 
shape of their skull.  
13 P16?P17 phrenology
14 P16?P17 She did not wait for your answer
15 P17?P16 I guess not
16 P16?S You didn?t wait for my answer
Immediately after the system?s greeting, the two participants also say ?Hi? and ?Hello?. Their 
greetings are detected as a single utterance by the system which partially overlaps with the be-
ginning of the system?s follow-up question (overlaps are underlined in the examples to the left). 
According to the current policy, the system does not release the floor on this interruption and 
continues with its question. The ?Yes? responses from (4) and (5) are overlapping with each other 
and are detected by the system as a single utterance which is correctly decoded. 
The system correctly infers the floor was addressed to it, and therefore takes the floor and pro-
duces the first question 
Given the pause between ?I?ll go? and ?Graphology? the response in (7) is in fact detected as two 
separate utterances by the system. The first part is non-understood, hence assumed addressed to 
other and the system does not take the floor. The system correctly understands and takes the 
floor after ?Graphology?, and moves to ask for confirmation (8). Next, while the system asks the 
other participant for confirmation, due to imperfections in echo cancellation, the system hears a 
noise at the beginning of its utterance, but ignores the detected ?barge-in?. 
P17 softly says to herself ?graph-?. This utterance is not actually detected by the system. 
Next, the system misunderstands the utterance in (10) as ?that sounds right? and incorrectly infers 
that the utterance was addressed to it. It therefore takes the floor and continues. This leads to a 
turn-initial overlap with the ?Phrenology? utterance immediately produced by P17 (11) 
 
 
The follow-up utterances and discussion between participants (13-16) overlap with portions of the 
system?s explanation. They indicate the high cost of the misunderstanding and of the system?s 
incorrect inference and decision to take the floor (admonished by the user in (16) n, as well as 
the shortcomings of the current policy to not release the floor for barge-ins detected during expla-
nations. This example highlights the need for more robust inferences, but also better policies for 
releasing back the floor and for machinery that would allow the system to gracefully backing from 
detected floor conflicts.
