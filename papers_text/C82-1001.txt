In th i s  paper  ae a t tempt  of learn ing  by verba l i sm is  shown in 
o rder  to  c reate  the  models  fo r  an~ident i f~cat ion  of unknown 
ob jec ts .  When we expect  a computer  to recogn ize  ob jec ts ,  the  
lode ls  of them ~must be g iven  to  i t ,  however there  are  cases  
where some ob jec ts  may not  be ,matchedto  the  models  or there  is  
no model  w i th  which ob jec t  is  compared.  At that  t ime,  th i s  
sys tem can augment o r  c reate  new descr ip t ions  by be ing  
exp l i c i t l y  taught  us ing  verba l  ins t ruc t ions .  
1. IntrodUction 
We have repor ted  the  s tory  unders tand ing  sys tem which uses  both  
l ingu is t i c  and p ic tor ia l l in fo rmat ion  in o rder  to,  reso lve  the  meaning 
of  g iven isentences  and images.  In th i s  research ,  we have be l ieve  that  
a cor rec t  meaning of the  g iven  sentences  is  obta ined  i f  the  re la t ions  
among noun .phrases ,  which cor respond I to ob jec ts  in the  images,  
cons is tent  w i th  the  re la t ions  observed  among ob jec ts  in the  images.  
The J fac t  that  th i s  ident i f i ca t ion  : of  ob jec ts  and the  
in terpreta t ion  ~:of the  g iven  sentences  supp lements  each o ther  
s imp l i f ies  both  the  detect ion  of ob jec ts  and d i samib iguat ion  of word 
sense  or p repos i t iona l  g roups .  In Sp i te  of these  e f fec ts ,  th i s  
fo r la l i sn  has a de fect  that  i t  requ i res  add i t iona l  knowledge  sources ,  
the  model of ob jec ts  that  w i l l  appear  inpthe  images.  Al l  of models  of 
ob jec ts  or ac tors  that  a re  supposed to appear  in, the  p ic ture  must be 
g iven  to our sys tem in o rder  to ach ieve  i t s  purposes .  But i t  i s  not  
easy fo r  us to s to re  a l l  of  such models  in a computer .  I f  a person  
who does not  know. wel l  about  the  deta i l s  of th i s  sys tem wants  to 
in teract ,w i th  i t~ he w i l l  g ive  up to  use the  sys tem,  as he knows 
noth ing  !of the  representat ion~ of models  in the  computer .  To make 
mat ters  worse ,  there ,  a re  qu i te  many var ia t ions  in rea l  ob jec ts  wh ich  
we w i l l .  encounter  in  the  rea l  wor ld .  For example ,we can see var ious  
type  of houses .  ~:In the  t rad i t iona l  AI sys tem,  :a gener ic  model is  
u t i l i zed J  to ident i fy  such c lass  of ob jec ts .  But i t  is  not  easy  for  
such a sys tem to d i sc r iminate  id iosyncrasy  of varous  ob jec ts ,  i F ig . l  
shows a par t~ of sample s tory  used to exper iment  i t s  s to ry  
unders tand ing  capab i l i ty .  Even i f  the  sys tem is  supposed to be g iven  
a gener ic  model ( fo r  example,  BOGLE) that  represents  both  OBAQ and 
OJIRO, the  sys tem wi l l  not  be ab le  to d i sc r iminate  them.  The sys tem 
needs  some ,p roper  model fo r  0BAQ and OJIRO. But i f  a new character  
which has some s imi la r  po in ts  to;0BAQ and OJIR0 apperes  in the  s tory ,  
some mod i f i ca t ions l  to the  BOGLE model a re  requ i red . ,  Thus 
genera l i za t ion  process  cou ld  not  be acompl i sed  in advance ,  but  shou ld  
be ach ieved  through exper iance .  
When, we are  asked to do some task ,  we are  usua l ly  g iven  
in fo rmat ions  concern ing  to  the  ob jec ts  of that  task  and ~the i r  
p rocess ing  method.  In case  where we encounter  some~unkown ob jec ts  ~n 
the  course  of the  taskL we can const ruct  aJ more gener ic  ,model 
inc lud ing  them ~together  w i th  a ,e reat ion  of ins tance  models  fo r  those  
ind iv idua ls  by d~manding an exp lanat ion  to a person  who knows wel l  
about those  ob jec ts .  In th i s~rea l  s i tuat ion ,  i t  cannot  be expected  
that  a learn ing  process  proceeds  success fu l ly  l i ke  the  exper iment  
s tud ied  :by Winston ,  as the  assumpt ion  fa i l s  of success  that  the  
samples  can be ar ranged conven ient ly  fo r  the  learn ing .  We usua l ly  
augment our  knowledge by exp l i c i t l y  be ing  taught  about miss ing  or 
insu f f i c ient  par ts  of the  known mode ls .  
In o rder  to rea l i ze  th i s  type of learn ing ,  there  are  two impor tant  
p rob lems to be so lved .  F i r s t  i s  an exp lanat ion  capab i l i ty .  Un less  a 
2 N. ABE and S. TSUJI 
capab i l i ty  to convey one 's  obscure  po in ts  ta  h i s  par tner : i s  g iven  to 
the  sys tem,  i t  i s  d i f f i cu l t  fo r  the  sys tem to  obta in  good ins t ruc t ions  
from i t s  par tnerL  
Second is  a : :po int  that  f romiwhat  k ind  of leve ls  of knowledge 
s ta te  the  system~:sheuld s tar t  i t s  learn ing  process .  Should an in i t ia l  
s ta te  o f~knowledge be g iven  in forms of an inner  representat ion  or be 
exp la ined  in natura l  language? We se lec t  the  former  approach  by jus t  
the  fo l low ing  reason .  Ve th ink  i t  qu i te  d i f f i cu l t  to g ive  a c lear  view 
to unknown ob jec t  w i thout  re fer r ing  to  mode ls .  So we res t r i c t  a c lass  
of ob jec ts  learned  by our sys tem:to  the  group of ob jec ts  of which the  
sys tem can .obta in  c lear  v iews concern ing  to the i r  cond i t ions  th rough 
the  compar i son  w i th  the i r  s imi la r  example .  
But the  assumpt ion  i s  not  requ i red  that ,  examples  shou ld  be 
d i f fe rent  in on ly  one or two po in ts  at  most from the  unknown ob jec t .  
Many, d i sc repanc ies  between the  ob jec t  and i t s  models  a re  permi t ted  to 
ex is~ because  such  d i f fe rences  can be exp la ined  exp l i c i ty  in the  
language,  by a teacher .  And through a cogn i t ion  of ana log ica l  or 
d i sc repant  po in ts  of ob jec ts  be long ing  to  the  same conceptua l  c lass ,  a 
genera l i za t ion  process  i s  invoked that  c reates  a common concept  to 
them. 
~. Descr ip t ion  for Object  
The 'model  descr ip t ion  used in th i s  paper  is ,  the  same one shown in 
the  paper \ [ I \ ]  except  fo r  the  usage of the  frame representat ion  to 
descr ibe~ re la t ions  among subpar tso f  the  model .  Let exp lan  us ing  an 
example .  F ig .2  shows the  OBAQ, who i s  an ac tor  of the  ' sample  s tory  
shown in F ig . l i  To descr ibe  locat ion  of subpar ts  of th i s  model ,  i t s  
main par t  i s  enc losed  by a rec tang le  as shown in F ig .2 .  Then th i s  
rec tang le  i s  dev ided  in to  9 subreg ions  and the  locat ion  of i t s  
subpar ts ,  i s  descr ibed  in terms of these  subreg ions .  Yhen some of 
these  subpar ts  ihas  a l so  subpar ts ,  they :are  h ie rarch ica l ly  descr ibed  
in the  s imi la r  way. And the  re la t ions  between these  subpar ts  i s  
represented  us ing  the  frame, s t ruc tures .  The frame s t ruc tures  
cor respond ing  to : the  DBAQ model i s  g iven  in F ig .3  ( th i s  f igure  shows a 
hypothet ica l  model of OJIRO obta ined  from the  copy of OBAQ f rame, )  
3. FraRe Representat ion  
The s lo t  AKO means a we l l -known re la t ion  A-KIND-OF, ana the  CLASS 
i nd icates  whether  the  frame is  gner ic  or ins tance  f rame.  I f  the  frame 
is  gener ic ,  then  i t  has two s lo t ,  GEN~ record ing  i t s  lower c las~ of 
gener ic  f rames and \[NST record ing  i t s  ins tance  f rames .  The F\[G s lo t  
represents  a p ic to r ia l  re ra t ion ,  to i t s  parent  f rame.  Th is  s lo t  means 
that  the  par t  cor respond ing  to th i s  frame is  a subpar t  of the  , f rame 
s tored  in the  PART and that  i t  can be found by look ing  for  the reg ion  
des ignated  in POS- And the  facet  01R descr ibes  a re la t ion  which th i s  
~ ar t  has to i t s  parent~ There are  th ree  re la t ions  concern ing  to the  In as shown in F ig .2  and concer ing  to the  POS, many combinat ions  of 
subreg ions  are  ~permi t ted  which can be expressed  w i th  the  symbo ls ,  
L ,C ,R .and  U,C,D.,: Espec ia l l y  the  symbols  o ** a re  used to des ignate  
the  locat ions  shown in F ig .4 .  The s lo t  SH~P represent  whether  the  par t  
cor respond ing  to  th i s  frame is  a reg ion(~EG)  or a branch(BR A) The 
SU~P s lo t  records  i t s  subpar ts  and the i r  locat ions  of or re ia t ions  to 
th i s  par t  a re  descr ibed  in th ree  facets  as sho~n above.  EspeC ia l ly  
when the  ~HAP cond i t ion  is  0~A, th~s frame has a ~BB s lo t  ~nstead  of 
~ F ig  1. 
He pu~ it, He ~lls OJ|RO. OJl~O takes ~t. A sample  s tory

A LEARNING OF  OBJECT  STRUCTURES BY  VERBAL ISM 
SUOPslot and a branch s t ructure  i s  recorded  here .  An example  :o f  
b ranch  i s  shown in  F ig .5 .  The COL s lo t  records  a co lo r  of  th i s  par t  
and a s lo t  CONCEPT means that  th i s  frame i s  p repared  for  the  
conceptua l  cons is tency '  of  f rames and not  fo r  p ic tor ia l  re la t ion .  In 
add i t iont to  these  s lo ts ,  there  are  severa l  s lo ts ,  WAKE, SEX, NUM and 
so on. These  are  prepa i red  , to  generate  a sentence  fo r  s ta t ing  a 
reason  why th i s l  frame i s  requ i red  or an exp lanat ion  about  why 
d isc repanc ies  between an ob jec t  and i t s  model can he found out  in i t s  
match ing :process .  
4.  Bas ic :S t ra tegy  o f  Learn ing  
The sys tem t r ies  to  generate ,a  model fo r  the  unknown ob jec t  by 
re fer r ing  to  an ana log ica l  model and us ing  a teacher ' s  ins t ruct ion ,  
and s imul taneous ly  i t  augments  the  concept  t rees~of  ob jec ts .  At that  
t ime,  the f i r s t  key fo r  a detect ion  of  ana logy  i s  assumed to  be in 
locat ions  of  subpar ts  of  ob jec ts .  When we are  to ld  that  an unknown 
ob jec t  i s  s imi la r  to  a cer ta in  ob jec t  amOng var ious  po in ts  of  v iew,  we 
usua l ly  expect  that  many subst ructures  hav ing  s imi la r  features  w i l l  be 
found in the same locat ion  as the  re fered  ob jec t ?  Of course , , there  
are  many examples  that  resemblance  in a Iocat ion~ i s  not  use fu l  hut 
p reventsc the  program from ach iev ing  a cor rect  detect ion  of  ana logy .  At 
that  case ,  the  teacher  shou ld  exp l i c i l ty  te l l  the  program to ignore

5. Example 
We would llke to explain how the dialog shown in 5. has been 
obtained. By (I~ the program generate OIJRO model from OBAQ model 
shown in Fig.3:~ and constructs a frame tree consisting from a BOGLE 
frame and the OBAQ frame, is stored as an instance of the BOGLE frame. 
But it records~in its STM thatlthere is just one hair as the teacher 
said so. Next, C~looks for a candidate region of OJIRO using the 
copied model. In.the second frame, OBAQ, TABLE, APPLE, CLOCK and OJIRO 
are drawn, but as the first four,objects have been appeared in the 
first frame, in this case C can find OJIRO by looking for new objects. 
But regrettably a color of the region (yellow) which seems to be 
OJ-IRO'S. body(J-BODY) being different from that of the model(white), 
this cause a complaint shown in (2) and by accepting a T's agreement C 
can believe its correctness and T can also think C in a right state. 
Consequently, C changes value of C0L in J-BODY into YELLOW. 
Next~ C t r ies  a ver i f i ca t ion io f  J-HAIR which  i s  the  ~f i r s t  member 
of  Scots'r; where  Scou'r={J-HAIR,J-HAND} 
As C can be aware of the  fac t  that  J-HAIR i s  a ha i r  by i t s  AK0 
s lo t  and that  there  i s  a note  on the  ha i r  in  STM, i t  can know that  
0 J IR0 'S  ~ha i r  cannot  be recogn ized  on ly  by re fe r r ing~to  the  cop ied  
mode l .  S ince  the  jus t  one a l te ra t ion  in  the  number of ha i r s  i s  
recordedf  there , ,  C th inks  the i r  l ocat ion  to  be same as t l~  model 
spec i f i ca t ion ,  end can f ind  a l ine  in  the  ((C)U) par t  of J -B0bY. I t  
ends  the  ve~f f i ca t ion  of J-HAIR by s to r ing  (H1 NIL) .  in to  SUBB ~lor  io 
p lace  o f : (L1  NIL L2 NIL L3 NIL) .  In a s imi la r  ~ay to th i s ,  C beg ins  to  
A LEARNING OF OBJECT STRUCTURES BY VERBALISM 
ident i fy  J-HAND, however C can be aware of that  i t  shou ld  10ok for  
J-R-HAND and J-L-HAND, as ~here is  a CONCEPT s lo t  in J-HAND. So C 
succeeds  in the  ident i f i ca t ion*o f  them~because .o f  a per fec t  match in 
the i r  locat ions ,  co lo rs  and subst ructureS .  
The resu l t  of  th i s  s teps  is  repor ted  in (3 ) .  Next , .  the  
ident i f i ca t ion  process  proceeds  to Sin and C s tar ts  a ver i f i ca t ion  of 
J-MOUTH,~where SIxffi(J-MOUTH, J -EYE).  As the  locat iona l  const ra in t  fo r  
th i s  par t  i s  ( ( ** )C) ,  which means that  i t  occup ies  ( (L )C) ,  ( (C) ,C)  and 
( (R) ,C)  of J-BODY, the  check  is  a t tempted  whether  jus t  one cand idate  
can be found fo r  each o f . these  3 subreg ions .  In th i s  case ,  noth ing  i s  
found for  ( (L )C) land  ((R)C) but  severa l  par ts  a re  found in ((C)C) of 
J-BODY. So th i s  p rocess  i s  suspende d and ident i f i ca t ion  of o ther  
par ts  (J~R-EYE and J-L-EYE) i s  a t tempted ,  but  the  same ambigu i ty  as 
the  above occurs  and th i s  causes  the  ident i f i ca t ion  s teps  to be 
suspended.  Consequent ly ,  fo r  each one of these  3 par ts , , the i r  resu l t s

T. Use of  Gener ic  Frames 
As ment ioned in 4 . ,  OBAQ frame causes  BOGLE frame to~be generated  
as a gener ic  ene,  and OJIRO frame ~is obta ined  through learn ing  
process .  At p resent  our program ~ust makes frame, t rees  in which OJIRO 
and OBAQ frame are  ch i ld  of BOGLE. 
A reason  fo r  th i s~ is  par t ly  due to a lack of conds iderat ion  how 
s imple  p ic tor ia l idescr ip t ions  can be compi led  from var ious  types  of 
dev ia t ions  in s lo t  va lues .  An another  reason  i s  that  there  is  a 
danger  of par t ia l  rear rangements  of f rames t rees~ In the  example ,  we 
at  f i r s t  be l ieve  OBAQiframe to be an ins tance ,  frame but i t  may turn  
out that i i t  i s  not  an ins tance  when other  examples not  mat.ched to th i s  
frame appears  in : image,  because  there  are  many var ie t ions  in h i s  shape 
as he can wink or move h is  eyes  or open h is  mouth. A f te r  program have 
N. ABE and S. TSUJI 
exper inced  these  example ,  i t  shou ld  ~:,~ke a genera l  concept  of OBAQ and 
ar range  f rame t rees  by eras ing  unnecessary  ins tances  about  him. 
As amore  impor tant  p rob lem,  s . ra teg ies  to  d i scover  cues  fo r  
f ind ing  ana logy  between subpar ts  mus.  be ls tored  in  some s lo ts  of the i r  
model ;  that  i s ,  the  locat iona l  con~ a in t  i s  a use fu l  cue fo r  human, 
an imals  and so on, but  i s  not  adeq,  i fo r  doors  and w indors  of houses .  
Though there  are  some inco~ ,e te  po in ts  in  the  const ruct ion  of 
f rame t rees ,  p rogram can  use  a po, 1on of them to ident i fy  subpar ts  of 
the  ob jec t  to  be learned .  For e~ample ,  suppose  that  we,would l i ke  to  
teach  a character  Q-KO by re fer r in~ to  OJIBO. Let suppose  that  Q-RO 
resembles  to  him very  much except  fo r  her  eyes  but  that  they  are  
ra ther  s imi la r  to OBAQ's. In the  course  of ident i f i ca t ion  of her ,  i f  
OBAQ f rame i s  not  s to red ,  p rogram wi l l  compla in  about  her  eyes  as we l l  
as in  the  learn ing  of OJIRO from OBAQ. However i t  can use  OBAQ'S eyes  
in  the  1recogn i t ion  of her  eyes  by t rac ing  i t s  AKO l ink  and f ind ing  
OBAQ f rame,  a f te r  a fa i lu re  in  the  match ing  of her  eyes  to O J lRO's .  Of 
cause ,  i t  does  not  do that  w i thout  teacher ' s  permiss ion~ hut  w i l l  ask  
fo r  h i s  approvals ;  
8. Exp lanat ion  Capab i l i ty  " 
I t  i s  necessary  fo r  teacher  to  be g iven  su f f i c ient  exp lanat ions  
about  the  leve l  of knowledge the  computer  has  a t ta ined .  Un less  the  
computer~can te l l  him what i t  i s~ look ing  fo r ,  what i t  has  a l ready  
found,  what sor t  of descrepanc ies  i t  su f fe rs  f rom, he cannot  g ive  
~ roper  ins t ruct ions  lead ing  the  ~computer  to  a sat i s fas tory  s ta te .  here  are  many sentence  generat ing  and exp lanat ion  sys tems,  however  an 
exp lanat ion  sys tem l i ke  th i s  research  has  not  been  invest igated  in  the  
po in t  that  our  sys tem t r ies  to  g ive  i t s  par tner  an exp lanat ion  or 
p ic tor ia l  features  of ob jec ts  to :be  modeled by t rans la t ing  sentences  
not  from the  case  frame, of sentences  but  from f rames  cor respond ing  to  
the  p ic tor ia l  mode ls .  Natura l lysuch  an exp lanat ion  i s  on locat ions ,  
shapes ,  : co lo rs  and re la t ions  that  models  or  ob jec ts  have ,  and must be 
g iven  in,  the  forms that  the  par tner  can eas i ly  unders tand  what the  
sys tem knows. 'For th i s  purpose ,  the  exp lanat ion  on locat ions  i s  f i r s t  
a t tempted  us ing  the  re fer red  th ings  in  the  d ia log ,  and is  f ina l ly  
g iven  in  an abso lude  coord inate  based  on the  9 subreg ions  i f  there  i s  
no re ference  or the  re ference  s tack  becomes empty.  (4 ) , (5 ) , (6 )  in the  
Scenar io~ shows <th is  mechan ism.  The next  impor tant  th ing  i s  that  a 
par tner  may expect  a deta i l  exp lanat ion  fo r  someth ing ,  but  expect  jus t  
a s imple  one fo r  o thers .  Regret tab ly  the  present  sa te  of our  p rogram 
cannot  detect  h i s  demand l i ke  th i s  or reso lve  ambiguous po in ts  of h i s  
quest ion l  then  i t  must ask  him about  h i s  requ i re  as shown in  (7 ) .  In 
th i s  case ,  there ia re  a l so  many th ings  to  be exp la ined ,  however  the  
po in ts  a re  on ly  s ta ted  by the  program and the  deta i l  exp lanat ion  i s  
le f t  to  the  par tner  as in  (8 ) .  We be l ieve  th i s  method proper  because  
of eas iness  of exp lanat ions .  
The compar i son  between th ings  are  l i s ted  in  above of (9) in  o rder  
to  c la r i fy  the i r~d i f fe renc ies .  I f  more deta i l  on the  l ip  i s  needed,  
the  par tner  can ask  the  sys tem about  itL On account  of l im i ted  space ,  
though we cannot  s ta te  a su f f i c ient  :d i scuss ion ,  there  are  many 
prob lems to  he improved on how the  sys tem shou ld  grasp  par tner ' s  
in tent ion  or  requ i rments .  They must be so lved  fo r  g iv ing  s imple  
exp lanat ion  to  the  par tner .
