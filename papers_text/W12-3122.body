Abstract
We address two challenges for automatic ma-
chine translation evaluation: a) avoiding the
use of reference translations, and b) focusing
on adequacy estimation. From an economic
perspective, getting rid of costly hand-crafted
reference translations (a) permits to alleviate
the main bottleneck in MT evaluation. From
a system evaluation perspective, pushing se-
mantics into MT (b) is a necessity in order
to complement the shallow methods currently
used overcoming their limitations. Casting
the problem as a cross-lingual textual entail-
ment application, we experiment with differ-
ent benchmarks and evaluation settings. Our
method shows high correlation with human
judgements and good results on all datasets
without relying on reference translations.
1 Introduction
While syntactically informed modelling for statis-
tical MT is an active field of research that has re-
cently gained major attention from the MT commu-
nity, work on integrating semantic models of ade-
quacy into MT is still at preliminary stages. This sit-
uation holds not only for system development (most
current methods disregard semantic information, in
favour of statistical models of words distribution),
but also for system evaluation. To realize its full po-
tential, however, MT is now in the need of semantic-
aware techniques, capable of complementing fre-
quency counts with meaning representations.
In order to integrate semantics more deeply into
MT technology, in this paper we focus on the eval-
uation dimension. Restricting our investigation to
some of the more pressing issues emerging from this
area of research, we provide two main contributions.
1. An automatic evaluation method that avoids
the use of reference translations. Most current
metrics are based on comparisons between auto-
matic translations and human references, and reward
lexical similarity at the n-gram level (e.g. BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002),
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover
et al., 2006)). Due to the variability of natural lan-
guages in terms of possible ways to express the same
meaning, reliable lexical similarity metrics depend
on the availability of multiple hand-crafted (costly)
realizations of the same source sentence in the tar-
get language. Our approach aims to avoid this bot-
tleneck by adapting cross-lingual semantic inference
capabilities and judging a translation only given the
source sentence.
2. A method for evaluating translation adequacy.
Most current solutions do not consistently reward
translation adequacy (semantic equivalence between
source sentence and target translation). The scarce
integration of semantic information in MT, specif-
ically at the multilingual level, led to MT systems
that are ?illiterate? in terms of semantics and mean-
ing. Moreover, current metrics are often difficult to
interpret. In contrast, our method targets the ade-
quacy dimension, producing easily interpretable re-
sults (e.g. judgements in a 4-point scale).
Our approach builds on recent advances in
cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) recognition,
which provides a natural framework to address MT
adequacy evaluation. In particular, we approach
the problem as an application of CLTE where bi-
171
directional entailment between source and target is
considered as evidence of translation adequacy. Be-
sides avoiding the use of references, the proposed
solution differs from most previous methods which
typically rely on surface-level features, often ex-
tracted from the source or the target sentence taken
in isolation. Although some of these features might
correlate well with adequacy, they capture seman-
tic equivalence only indirectly, and at the level of
a probabilistic prediction. Focusing on a combina-
tion of surface, syntactic and semantic features, ex-
tracted from both source and target (e.g. ?source-
target length ratio?, ?dependency relations in com-
mon?), our approach leads to informed adequacy
judgements derived from the actual observation of
a translation given the source sentence.
2 Background
Some recent works proposed metrics able to approx-
imately assess meaning equivalence between can-
didate and reference translations. Among these,
(Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2007) proposed a hetero-
geneous set comprising overlapping and matching
metrics, compiled from a rich set of variants at five
different linguistic levels: lexical, shallow-syntactic,
syntactic, shallow-semantic and semantic. More
similar to our approach, (Pado? et al., 2009) proposed
semantic adequacy metrics that exploit feature rep-
resentations motivated by Textual Entailment (TE).
Both metrics, however, highly depend on the avail-
ability of multiple reference translations.
Early attempts to avoid reference translations ad-
dressed quality estimation (QE) by means of large
numbers of source, target, and system-dependent
features to discriminate between ?good? and ?bad?
translations (Blatz et al., 2004; Quirk, 2004). More
recently (Specia et al., 2010b; Specia and Farzindar,
2010; Specia, 2011) conducted a series of experi-
ments using features designed to estimate translation
post-editing effort (in terms of volume and time) as
an indicator of MT output quality. Good results in
QE have been achieved by adding linguistic infor-
mation such as shallow parsing, POS tags (Xiong
et al., 2010), or dependency relations (Bach et al.,
2011; Avramidis et al., 2011) as features. However,
in general these approaches do not distinguish be-
tween fluency (i.e. syntactic correctness of the out-
put translation) and adequacy, and mostly rely on
fluency-oriented features (e.g. ?number of punctu-
ation marks?). As a result, a simple surface form
variation is given the same importance of a content
word variation that changes the meaning of the sen-
tence. To the best of our knowledge, only (Specia et
al., 2011) proposed an approach to frame MT evalu-
ation as an adequacy estimation problem. However,
their method still includes many features which are
not focused on adequacy, and often look either at the
source or at the target in isolation (see for instance
?source complexity? and ?target fluency? features).
Moreover, the actual contribution of the adequacy
features used is not always evident and, for some
testing conditions, marginal.
Our approach to adequacy evaluation builds on
and extends the above mentioned works. Similarly
to (Pado? et al., 2009) we rely on the notion of textual
entailment, but we cast it as a cross-lingual problem
in order to bypass the need of reference translations.
Similarly to (Blatz et al., 2004; Quirk, 2004), we try
to discriminate between ?good? and ?bad? transla-
tions, but we focus on adequacy. To this aim, like
(Xiong et al., 2010; Bach et al., 2011; Avramidis et
al., 2011; Specia et al., 2010b; Specia et al., 2011)
we rely on a large number of features, but focusing
on source-target dependent ones, aiming at informed
adequacy evaluation of a translation given the source
instead of a more generic quality assessment based
on surface features.
3 CLTE for adequacy evaluation
We address adequacy evaluation by adapting cross-
lingual textual entailment recognition as a way to
measure to what extent a source sentence and its au-
tomatic translation are semantically similar. CLTE
has been proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010) as an ex-
tension of textual entailment (Dagan and Glickman,
2004) that consists in deciding, given a text T and a
hypothesis H in different languages, if the meaning
of H can be inferred from the meaning of T.
The main motivation in approaching adequacy
evaluation using CLTE is that an adequate trans-
lation and the source text should convey the same
meaning. In terms of entailment, this means that an
adequate MT output and the source sentence should
entail each other (bi-directional entailment). Los-
172
ing or altering part of the meaning conveyed by the
source sentence (i.e. having more, or different infor-
mation in one of the two sides) will change the en-
tailment direction and, consequently, the adequacy
judgement. Framed in this way, CLTE-based ade-
quacy evaluation methods can be designed to dis-
tinguish meaning-preserving variations from true di-
vergence, regardless of reference translations.
Similarly to many monolingual TE approaches,
CLTE solutions proposed so far adopt supervised
learning methods, with features that measure to what
extent the hypotheses can be mapped into the texts.
The underlying assumption is that the probability of
entailment is proportional to the number of words in
H that can be mapped to words in T (Mehdad et al.,
2011). Such mapping can be carried out at differ-
ent word representation levels (e.g. tokens, lemmas,
stems), possibly with the support of lexical knowl-
edge in order to cross the language barrier between
T and H (e.g. dictionaries, phrase tables).
Under the same assumption, since in the adequacy
evaluation framework the entailment relation should
hold in both directions, the mapping is performed
both from the source to the target and vice-versa,
building on features extracted from both sentences.
Moreover, to improve over previous CLTE methods
and boost MT adequacy evaluation performance, we
explore the joint contribution of a number of lexi-
cal, syntactic and semantic features (Mehdad et al.,
2012).
Concerning the features used, it?s worth observ-
ing that the cost of implementing our approach (in
terms of required resources and linguistic proces-
sors), and the need of reference translations are in-
trinsically different bottlenecks for MT. While the
limited availability of processing tools for some lan-
guage pairs is a ?temporary? bottleneck, the acqui-
sition of multiple references is a ?permanent? one.
The former cost is reducing over time due to the
progress in NLP research; the latter represents a
fixed cost that has to be eliminated. Similar consid-
erations hold regarding the need of annotated data to
develop our supervised learning approach. Concern-
ing this, the cost of labelling source-target pairs with
adequacy judgments is significantly lower compared
to the creation of multiple references.
3.1 Features
In order to learn models for classification and regres-
sion we used the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithms implemented in the LIBSVM package
(Chang and Lin, 2011) with a linear kernel and de-
fault parameters setting. Aiming at objective ade-
quacy evaluation, our method limits the recourse to
MT system-dependent features to reduce the bias
of evaluating MT technology with its own core
methods. The experiments described in the follow-
ing sections are carried out on publicly available
English-Spanish datasets, exploring the potential of
a combination of surface, syntactic and semantic
features. Language-dependent ones are extracted
by exploiting processing tools for the two lan-
guages (part-of-speech taggers, dependency parsers
and named entity recognizers), most of which are
available for many languages.
Our feature set can be described as follows:
Surface Form (F) features consider the num-
ber of words, punctuation marks and non-word
markers (e.g. quotations and brackets) in source
and target, as well as their ratios (source/target and
target/source), and the number of out of vocabulary
terms encountered.
Shallow Syntactic (SSyn) features consider
the number and ratios of common part-of-speech
(POS) tags in source and target. Since the list of
valid POS tags varies for different languages, we
mapped English and Spanish tags into a common
list using the FreeLing tagger (Carreras et al., 2004).
Syntactic (Syn) features consider the number
and ratios of dependency roles common to source
and target. To create a unique list of roles, we used
the DepPattern (Otero and Lopez, 2011) package,
which provides English and Spanish dependency
parsers.
Phrase Table (PT) matching features are cal-
culated as in (Mehdad et al., 2011), with a phrasal
matching algorithm that takes advantage of a lexical
phrase table extracted from a bilingual parallel
corpus. The algorithm determines the number of
phrases in the source (1 to 5-grams, at the level of
173
tokens, lemmas and stems) that can be mapped into
target word sequences, and vice-versa. To build our
English-Spanish phrase table, we used the Europarl,
News Commentary and United Nations Spanish-
English parallel corpora. After tokenization, the
Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and the Moses toolkit
(Koehn et al., 2007) were respectively used to
align the corpora and extract the phrase table.
Although the phrase table was generated using MT
technology, its use to compute our features is still
compatible with a system-independent approach
since the extraction is carried out without tuning the
process towards any particular task. Moreover, our
phrase matching algorithm integrates matches from
overlapping n-grams of different size and nature
(tokens, lemmas and stems) which current MT
decoding algorithms cannot explore for complexity
reasons.
Dependency Relation (DR) matching fea-
tures target the increase of CLTE precision by
adding syntactic constraints to the matching pro-
cess. These features capture similarities between
dependency relations, combining syntactic and
lexical levels. We define a dependency relation
as a triple that connects pairs of words through a
grammatical relation. In a valid match, while the
relation has to be the same, the connected words
can be either the same, or semantically equivalent
terms in the two languages. For example, ?nsubj
(loves, John)? can match ?nsubj (ama, John)?
and ?nsubj (quiere, John)? but not ?dobj (quiere,
John)?. Term matching is carried out by means
of a bilingual dictionary extracted from parallel
corpora during PT creation. Given the dependency
tree representations of source and target produced
with DepPattern, for each grammatical relation r we
calculate two DR matching scores as the number
of matching occurrences of r in both source and
target, respectively normalized by: i) the number of
occurrences of r in the source, and ii) the number of
occurrences of r in the target.
Semantic Phrase Table (SPT) matching features
represent a novel way to leverage the integration of
semantics and MT-derived techniques. Semantically
enhanced phrase tables are used as a recall-oriented
complement to the lexical PT matching features.
SPTs are extracted from the same parallel corpora
used to build lexical PTs, augmented with shallow
semantic labels. To this aim, we first annotate the
corpora with the FreeLing named-entity tagger,
replacing named entities with general semantic
labels chosen from a coarse-grained taxonomy
(person, location, organization, date and numeric
expression). Then, we combine the sequences of
unique labels into one single token of the same
label. Finally, we extract the semantic phrase
table from the augmented corpora in the same way
mentioned above. The resulting SPTs are used to
map phrases between NE-annotated source-target
pairs, similar to PT matching. SPTs offer three
main advantages: i) semantic tags allow to match
tokens that do not occur in the original parallel
corpora used to extract the phrase table, ii) SPT
entries are often short generalizations of longer
original phrases, so the matching process can
benefit from the increased probability of mapping
higher order n-grams (i.e. those providing more
contextual information), and iii) their smaller size
has positive impact on system?s efficiency, due to
the considerable search space reduction.
4 Experiments and results
4.1 Datasets
Datasets with manual evaluation of MT output have
been made available through a number of shared
evaluation tasks. However, most of these datasets
are not specifically annotated for adequacy measure-
ment purposes, and the available adequacy judge-
ments are limited to few hundred sentences for some
language pairs. Moreover, most datasets are created
by comparing reference translations with MT sys-
tems? output, disregarding the input sentences. Such
judgements are hence biased towards the reference.
Furthermore, the inter-annotator agreement is often
low (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). In light of these
limitations, most of the available datasets are per se
not fully suitable for adequacy evaluation methods
based on supervised learning, nor to provide sta-
ble and meaningful results. To partially cope with
these problems, our experiments have been carried
out over two different datasets:
? 16K: 16.000 English-Spanish pairs, with
Spanish translations produced by multiple MT
174
systems, annotated by professional translators
with quality scores in a 4-point scale (Specia et
al., 2010a).
? WMT07: 703 English-Spanish pairs derived
from MT systems? output, with explicit ade-
quacy judgements on a 5-point scale.
The two datasets present complementary advan-
tages and disadvantages. On the one hand, al-
though it is not annotated to explicitly capture
meaning-related aspects of MT output, the quality
oriented dataset has the main advantage of being
large enough for supervised approaches. Moreover,
it should allow to check the effectiveness of our fea-
ture set in estimating adequacy as a latent aspect of
the more general notion of MT output quality. On
the other hand, the smaller dataset is less suitable
for supervised learning, but represents an appropri-
ate benchmark for MT adequacy evaluation.
4.2 Adequacy and quality prediction
To experiment with our CLTE-based evaluation
method minimizing overfitting, we randomized each
dataset 5 times (D1 to D5), and split them into 80%
for training and 20% for testing. Using different
feature sets, we then trained and tested various re-
gression models over each of the five splits, and
computed correlation coefficients between the CLTE
model predictions and the human gold standard an-
notations ([1-4] for quality, and [1-5] for adequacy).
16K quality-based dataset
In Table 1 we compare the Pearson?s correlation
coefficient of our SVM regression models against
the results reported in (Specia et al., 2010b), calcu-
lated with the same three common MT evaluation
metrics with a single reference: BLEU, TER and
Meteor. For the sake of comparison, we also re-
port the average quality correlation (QE) obtained
by (Specia et al., 2010b) over the same dataset.1
The results show that the integration of syntac-
tic and semantic information allows our adequacy-
oriented model to achieve a correlation with hu-
man quality judgements that is always significantly

2010b), since the distributions of the 16K dataset is different
from our randomized distribution.
higher2 than the correlation obtained by the MT
evaluation metrics used for comparison. As ex-
pected a considerable improvement over surface fea-
tures is achieved by the integration of syntactic in-
formation. A further increase, however, is brought
by the complementary contribution of SPT (recall-
oriented, due to the higher coverage of semantics-
aware phrase tables with respect to lexical PTs), and
DR matching features (precision-oriented, due to
the syntactic constraints posed to matching text por-
tions). Although they are meant to capture meaning-
related aspects of MT output, our features allow
to outperform the results obtained by the generic
quality-oriented features used by (Specia et al.,
2010b), which do not discriminate between ade-
quacy and fluency.3 When dependency relations and
phrase tables (both lexical and semantics-aware) are
used in combination, our scores also outperform the
average QE score. Finally, looking at the different
random splits of the same dataset (D1 to D5), our
correlation scores remain substantially stable, prov-
ing the robustness of our approach not only for ade-
quacy, but also for quality estimation.
WMT07 adequacy-based dataset
In Table 2 we compare our regression model,
obtained in the same way previously described,
against three commonly used MT evaluation metrics
(Callison-Burch et al., 2007). In this case, the re-
ported results do not show the same consistency over
the 5 randomized datasets (D1 to D5). However, it is
worth pointing out that: i) the small dataset is partic-
ularly challenging to train models with higher corre-
lation with humans, ii) our aim is checking how far
we get using only adequacy-oriented features rather
than outperforming BLEU/TER/Meteor at any cost,
and iii) our results are not far from those achieved
by metrics that rely on reference translations. Com-
pared with Meteor, the correlation is even higher
proving the effectiveness of the proposed method.

test implemented in (Pado?, 2006).
3As reported in (Specia et al., 2010b), more than 50% (39
out of 74) of the features used is translation-independent (only
source-derived features).

4.3 Multi-class classification
To further explore the potential of our CLTE-based
MT evaluation method, we trained an SVM multi-
class classifier to predict the exact adequacy and
quality scores assigned by human judges. The eval-
uation was carried out measuring the accuracy of our
models with 10-fold cross validation to minimize
overfitting. As a baseline, we calculated the per-
formance of the Majority Class (MjC) classifier pro-
posed in (Specia et al., 2011), which labels all exam-
ples with the most frequent class among all classes.
The performance improvement over the result ob-
tained by the MjC baseline (?) has been calculated
to assess the contribution of different feature sets.
16K quality-based dataset
The accuracy results reported in Table 3a show
that also in this testing condition, syntactic and se-
mantic features improve over surface form ones. Be-
sides that, we observe a steady improvement over
the MjC baseline (from 5% to 12%). This demon-
strates the effectiveness of our adequacy-based fea-
tures to predict exact quality scores in a 4-point
scale, although this is a more challenging and dif-
ficult task than regression and binary classification.
Such improvement is even more interesting consid-
ering that (Specia et al., 2010b) reported discour-
aging results with multi-class classification to pre-
dict quality scores. Moreover, while they claimed
that removing target-independent features (i.e. those
only looking at the source text) significantly de-
grades their QE performance, we achieved good re-
sults without using any of these features.

ing from 14% to 20%. Interestingly, although the
dataset is small and the number of classes is higher
(5-point scale), the improvement and overall results
are better than those obtained on the 16K dataset.
Such result confirms our hypothesis that adequacy-
based features extracted from both source and target
perform better on a dataset explicitly annotated with
adequacy judgements. In addition, the improvement
over the MjC baseline (?) of our best model is much
higher (20%) than the one reported in (Specia et al.,
2011) on adequacy estimation (6%). We are aware
that their results are calculated over a dataset for a
different language pair (i.e. English-Arabic) which
brings up more challenges. However, our smaller
dataset (700 vs 2580 pairs) and the higher number
of classes (5 vs 4) compensate to some extent the
difficulty of dealing with English-Arabic pairs.
4.4 Recognizing ?good? vs ?bad? translations
Last but not least, we considered the traditional sce-
nario for quality and confidence estimation, which
is a binary classification of translations into ?good?
and ?bad? or, from the meaning point of view, ?ade-
quate? and ?inadequate?. Adequacy-oriented binary
classification has many potential applications in the
translation industry, ranging from the design of con-
fidence estimation methods that reward meaning-
preserving translations, to the optimization of the
translation workflow. For instance, an ?adequate?
translation can be just post-edited in terms of fluency
by a target language native speaker, without having
any knowledge of the source language. On the other
hand, an ?inadequate? translation should be sent to a
human translator or to another MT system, in order
to reach acceptable adequacy. Effective automatic
binary classification has an evident positive impact
on such workflow.
16K quality-based dataset
We grouped the quality scores in the 4-point scale
into two classes, where scores {1,2} are considered
as ?bad? or ?inadequate?, while {3,4} are taken as
?good? or ?adequate?. We carried out learning and
177
classification using different sets of features with 10-
fold cross validation. We also compared our accu-
racy with the MjC baseline, and calculated the im-
provement of each model (?) against it.
The results reported in Table 4a demonstrate that
the accuracy of our models is always significantly
superior to the MjC baseline. Moreover, also in this
case there is a steady improvement using syntactic
and semantic features over the results obtained by
surface form features. Additionally, it is worth men-
tioning that the best model improvement over the
baseline (?) is much higher (about 18%) than the
improvement reported in (Specia et al., 2010b) over
the same dataset (about 8%), considering the aver-
age score obtained with their data distribution. This
confirms the effectiveness of our CLTE approach
also in classifying ?good? and ?bad? translations.
WMT07 adequacy-based dataset
We mapped the 5-point scale adequacy scores into
two classes, with {1,2,3} judgements assigned to the
?inadequate? class, and {4,5} judgements assigned
to the ?adequate? class. The main motivation for this
distribution was to separate the examples in a way
that adequate translations are substantially accept-
able, while inadequate translations present evident
meaning discrepancies with the source.
The results reported in Table 4b show that the
accuracy of the binary classifiers to distinguish be-
tween ?adequate? and ?inadequate? classes was sig-
nificantly superior (up to about 15%) to the MjC
baseline. We also notice that surface form fea-
tures have a significant contribution to deal with the
adequacy-oriented dataset, while the gain obtained
using syntactic and semantic features (2%) is lower
than the improvement observed in the 16K dataset.
This might be due to the more unbalanced distribu-
tion of the classes which: i) leads to a high baseline,
and ii) together with the small size of the WMT07
dataset, makes supervised learning more challeng-
ing. Finally, the improvement of all models (?) over
the MjC baseline is much higher than the gain re-
ported in (Specia et al., 2011) over their adequacy-
oriented dataset (around 2%).
5 Conclusions
In the effort of integrating semantics into MT tech-
nology, we focused on automatic MT evaluation, in-
vestigating the potential of applying cross-lingual
textual entailment techniques for adequacy assess-
ment. The underlying assumption is that MT output
adequacy can be determined by verifying that an en-
tailment relation holds from the source to the target,
and vice-versa. Within such framework, this paper
makes two main contributions.
First, in contrast with most current metrics based
on the comparison between automatic translations
and multiple references, we avoid the bottleneck
represented by the manual creation of such refer-
ences.
Second, beyond current approaches biased to-
wards fluency or general quality judgements, we
tried to isolate the adequacy dimension of the prob-
lem, exploring the potential of adequacy-oriented
features extracted from the observation of source
and target.
To achieve our objectives, we successfully ex-
tended previous CLTE methods with a variety of lin-
guistically motivated features. Altogether, such fea-
tures led to reliable judgements that show high cor-
relation with human evaluation. Coherent results on
different datasets and classification schemes demon-
strate the effectiveness of the approach and its poten-
tial for different applications.
Future works will address both the improvement
of our adequacy evaluation method and its integra-
tion in SMT for optimization purposes. On one
hand, we plan to explore new features capturing
other semantic dimensions. A possible direction is
to consider topic modelling techniques to measure
the relatedness of source and target. Another inter-
esting direction is to investigate the use of Wikipedia
entity linking tools to support the mapping between
source and target terms. On the other hand, we plan
to explore the integration of our model as an error
criterion in SMT system training.
