Abstract 
 
This paper describes collaborative work 
on developing Indonesian WordNet in 
the AsianWordNet (AWN). We will de-
scribe the method to develop for colla-
borative editing to review and complete 
the translation of synset. This paper aims 
to create linkage among Asian languages 
by adopting the concept of semantic re-
lations and synset expressed in Word-
Net. 
 
1  Introduction 
 
Multilingual lexicons is of foremost importance 
for intercultural collaboration to take place, as 
multilingual lexicons are several multilingual 
application such as Machine Translation, 
terminology, multilingual computing.  
WordNet is the resource used to identify shallow 
semantic features that can be attached to lexical 
units. The original WordNet is English WordNet 
proposed and developed at Princeton University 
WordNet (PWN) by using bilingual dictionary.  
In the era of globalization, communication 
among languages becomes much more 
important. People has been hoping that natural 
language processing and speech processing. We 
can assist in smoothening the communication 
among people with different languages. 
However, especially for Indonesian language, 
there were only few researches in the past. 
The Princeton WordNet is one of the semantical-
ly English lexical banks containing semantic 
relationships between words. Concept mapping 
is a process of organizing to forming meaningful 
relationships between them. 
The goal of Indonesian AWN database man-
agement system is to share a multilingual lexical 
database of Indonesian language which are 
structured along the same lines as the AWN. 
AWN is the result of the collaborative effort in 
creating an interconnected Wordnet for Asian 
languages. AWN provides a free and public plat-
form for building and sharing among AWN. The 
distributed database system and user-friendly 
tools have been developed for user. AWN is 
easy to build and share. 
This paper describes manual interpretation me-
thod of Indonesian for AWN. Based on web ser-
vices architecture focusing on the particular 
cross-lingual distributed. We use collective in-
telligence approach to build this English equiva-
lent. In this sequel, in section 2 the collabora-
tions builders works on web interface at 
www.asianwordnet.org. In section 3, Interpretation 
of Indonesian AWN, short description of 
progress of English ? Indonesian translation and 
the obstacle of translation. 
 
2  Collaborative AW 
 
WordNet covers the vast majority of nouns, 
verbs, adjectives and adverbs from English lan-
guage. The words are organized in synonym sets 
called synset. Each synset represents a concept 
includes an impressive number of semantic rela-
tions defined across concepts. 
The information encoded in WordNet is used in 
several stages in the parsing process. For in-
stance, attribute relations, adjective/adverb clas-
sifications, and others are semantic features ex-
tracted from WordNet and stored together with  
the words, so that they can be directly used by 
the semantic parser.

To build language WordNet there are two main 
of discussion; the merge approach and the ex-
pand approach. The merge approach is to build 
the taxonomies of the language (synset) using 
English equivalent words from bilingual dictio-
naries. The expand approach is to map translate 
local words the bilingual dictionaries. This ap-
proach show the relation between senses. The 
system manages the synset assignment accord-
ing to the preferred score obtained from the revi-
sion process. For the result, the community will 
be accomplish into original form of WordNet 
database. The synset can generate a cross lan-
guage result. 
AWN also introduce a web-based collaborative 
workbench, for revising the result of synset as-
signment and provide a framework to create 
AWN via linkage through PWN synset. AWN 
enables to connect and collaborate among indi-
vidual intelligence in order accomplish a text 
files.  
At present, there are ten Asian language in the 
community. The amount of the translated syn-
sets had been increased. Many language have 
collaboration in AWN.

3  Interpretation of Indonesian AW 
 
Indonesian WordNet have been used as a gener-
al-purpose translation.   Our approach was to 
generate the query for the web services engine in 
English and then to translate every key element 
of the query (topic, focus, keywords) into Indo-
nesian without modifying the query. The dictio-
nary is distinguished by set of entry word cha-
racteristic, clear definitions, its guidance on 
usage. All dictionary information for entries is 
structured such as entry word, multiple word 
entries, notes, contemporary definitions, deriva-
tions, example sentence, idioms, etc. All dictio-
nary are implemented as text-files and as lin-
guistic databases connected to Indonesian AWN. 
The set of language tags consists of part of 
speech, case, gender, number, tense, person, 
voice, aspect, mood, form, type, reflexive, ani-
mation. 
 
3.1  Progress English ? Indonesian 
 
Indonesian WordNet is used Word Net Man-
agement System (WNMS) tools developed by 
AsianWordNet to create web services among 
Asia languages based on Princeton WordNet? 
version 3.0, Co-operation by TCL and BPPT 
establish on October 2007. 
As presented above, we follow the merge to 
create and share the Indonesian WordNet by 
translating the each synonym translation. We 
expand an appropriate synset to a lexical entry 
by considering its English equivalent. 
We plan to have reliable process to create and 
share Indonesian WordNet in AWN. We classify 
this work into four person AWN translators to 
participate in the project of Indonesian AWN.

Each person was given a target translator in a 
month should reach at least 3000 sense so that 
the total achievement 12000 senses in a month. 
From 117.659 senses that there is expected to be 
completed within 10 months. On the process of 
mapping, a unique word will be generated for 
every lexical entry which contain. The grammat-
ical dictionaries contain normalized entry word 
with hyphenation paradigm plus grammatical 
tags.

Table 1. Statistic of synsets 
 
In the evaluation of our approach for synset as-
signment, we selected randomly sense from the 
the result of synset assignment to English ? In-
donesian dictionary for manually checking. The 
random set cover all types of part-of-speech. 
With the best information of English equivalents 
marked with CS=5. The word entry must be 
translated into the appropriate words by meaning 
explanation. 
Table 1. presents total assignment translated 
words into Indonesian for the second third 
month.  Following the manual to translate the 
English AWN to Indonesian, we resulted the 
progress of AWN at this time.  
We start to translate or edit from some group of 
base type in ?By Category?. These base types 
are based on categories from PWN. There is on-
ly 21.89% ( approved 25,755 of 117,659 senses ) 
of the total number of the synsets that were able 
to be assigned to lexical entry in the Indonesian 
? English Dictionary. 
 
3.2  Obstacle of Indonesian Translation 
 
Wordnet has unique meaning of word which is 
presented in synonym set. Each synset has glos-
sary which defines concept its representation. 
For examples word car, auto, automobile, and 
motorcar has one synset. 
An automatic compilation of dictionary in AWN 
have a translational issues. There are many cases 
in explanation sense. One word in English will 
be translated into a lot of Indonesian words, 
glossary can be express more than one Indone-
sian word (Ex. 1).  
One of the main obstacles in studying the ab-
sorption of English words in Indonesian words, 
is the fact that the original form of some words 
that have been removed due to Indonesian 
reform process, in which some words have been 
through an artificial process. There is no special 
character in Indonesian word, especially in tech-
nical word, so that means essentially the same as 
the English word (Ex. 2).  
  
Ex. 1. time frame  
 POS  noun time 
 synset  time_frame 
 gloss  a time period 
   during which 
   something 
   occurs or is  
   expected to occur; 
   an agreement can 
   be reached in 
   a reasonably  
   short time frame" 
 Indonesian jangka waktu, 
   selang waktu 
 
Ex. 2.  resolution 
 POS  noun phenomenon  
 synset  resolution  
 gloss  (computer science) 
    the number  
   of pixels per 
   square inch on 
   a computer   
   generated display;  
   the greater  
   the resolution, the  
   better the picture 
 Indonesian resolusi 
 
Using definitions from the WordNet electronic 
lexical database. A major problem in natural 
language processing is that of lexical ambiguity, 
be it syntactic. Each single words must be con-
tainer for some part of the linguistic knowledge 
need to ambiguous wordnet sense. Therefore, 
11
not only a single heuristic translate Indonesian 
words. The WordNet defined in some semantic 
relations, this categories using lexicographer file 
and glossary definitions relations are assigned to 
weight in the range. WordNet hierarchy for the 
first sense of the word ?empty? there are 10  
synset words (I take three of ten) that are related 
to the meaning are the following in ( Ex. 3.) 
Three concepts recur in WordNet literature that 
entail a certain amount of ambiguity : termino-
logical distance, semantic distance and concep-
tual distance. Terminological distance, by con-
trast, often appears to refer to the suitability of 
the word selected to express a given concept. 
Semantic distance is understood to mean the 
contextual factor of precision in meaning. And 
the conceptual distance between words, in which 
have relations proved. 
 
Ex. 3.  empty 
 POS  noun art  
 synset  empty  
 gloss  a container that  
   has been  
   emptied; "return  
   all empties to  
   the store" 
 Indonesian hampa 
 
 empty 
 POS  verb change  
 synset  empty, discharge 
 gloss  become empty or 
    void of its  
   content; "The  
   room emptied" 
 Indonesian mengosongkan 
 
 empty 
 POS  adjectives all 
 synset  empty 
 gloss  emptied of emotion; 
   "after  the violent 
   argument he felt  
empty" 
 Indonesian kosong, penat 
 
Disambiguation is unquestionably the most ab-
undant and varied application. It  precision and 
relevance in response to a query  inconsisten-
cies. Schematically the semantic disambiguation 
are selected in the glossaries of each noun, verb, 
and adjectives and its subordinates. 
WordNet information, whose objective is to 
build designs for the association between sen-
tences and coherence relations as well as to find 
lexical characteristics in coherence categories. 
WordNet became an ancillary tool for semantic 
ontology design geared to high quality informa-
tion extraction from the web services. 
A comparative analysis of trends in wordnet use 
: 
 
1. Support for the design of grammatical 
categories designed to classify 
information by aspects and traits, but in 
particular to design and classify 
semantic ontologies. 
2. Basis for the development of audio-
visual and multi-media information 
retrieval systems.

5  Discussion and Conclusion 
 
Any multilingual process such as cross-lingual 
information must involve resources and lan-
guage pair. Language specific can be applied in 
parallel to achieve best result.  
In this paper we describe manually sharing of 
Indonesian in the AWN by using  dictionaries. 
AWN provides a free and public platform for 
building and sharing among AWN. We want 
continue the work defined learning  the service 
matching system. Our future work on AWN will 
focuses in development platform WordNet and 
language technology web services. 
Although AWN application are going steadily, 
the limitations are: 
 
1. AWN designed for manual so 
authenticity can not be a reference. 
 
2. Classification was performed manually, 
which means that the reasons and depth 
of classification may not be consistent.
