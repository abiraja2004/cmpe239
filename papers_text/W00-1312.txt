Abstract 
This paper presents empirical results in 
cross-lingual information retrieval using 
English queries to access Chinese 
documents (TREC-5 and TREC-6) and 
Spanish documents (TREC-4). Since our 
interest is in languages where resources 
may be minimal, we use an integrated 
probabilistic model that requires only a 
bilingual dictionary as a resource. We 
explore how a combined probability 
model of term translation and retrieval can 
reduce the effect of translation ambiguity. 
In addition, we estimate an upper bound 
on performance, if translation ambiguity 
were a solved problem. We also measure 
performance as a function of bilingual 
dictionary size. 
1 Introduction 
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) can 
serve both those users with a smattering of 
knowledge of other languages and also those 
fluent in them. For those with limited 
knowledge of the other language(s), CLIR offers 
a wide pool of documents, even though the user 
does not have the skill to prepare ahigh quality 
query in the other language(s). Once documents 
are retrieved, machine translation or human 
translation, if desired, can make the documents 
usable. For the user who is fluent in two or 
more languages, even though e/she may be able 
to formulate good queries in each of the source 
languages, CLIR relieves the user from having 
to do so. 
Most CLIR studies have been based on a variant 
of tf-idf; our experiments instead use a hidden 
Markov model (HMM) to estimate the 
probability that a document is relevant given the 
query. We integrated two simple estimates of 
term translation probability into the mono- 
lingual HMM model, giving an estimate of the 
probability that a document is relevant given a 
query in another language. 
In this paper we address the following questions: 
? How can a combined probability model of 
term translation and retrieval minimize the 
effect of translation ambiguity? (Sections 3, 
5, 6, 7, and 10) 
? What is the upper bound performance using 
bilingual dictionary lookup for term 
translation? (Section 8) 
? How much does performance d grade due to 
omissions from the bilingual dictionary and 
how does performance vary with size of 
such a dictionary? (Sections 8-9) 
All experiments were performed using a 
common baseline, an HMM-based (mono- 
lingual) indexing and retrieval engine. In order 
to design controlled experiments for the 
questions above, the IR system was run without 
sophisticated query expansion techniques. 
Our experiments are based on the Chinese 
materials of TREC-5 and TREC-6 and the 
Spanish materials of TREC-4. 
2 HMM for Mono-Lingual Retrieval 
Following Miller et al, 1999, the IR system 
ranks documents according to the probability 
that a document D is relevant given the query Q, 
P(D is R IQ). Using Bayes Rule, and the fact 
that P(Q) is constant for a given query, and our 
initial assumption of a uniform a priori 
95 
probability that a document is relevant, ranking 
documents according to P(Q\[D is R) is the same 
as ranking them according to P(D is RIQ). The 
approach therefore estimates the probability that 
a query Q is generated, given the document D is 
relevant. (A glossary of symbols used appears 
below.) 
We use x to represent the language (e.g. 
English) for which retrieval is carried out. 
According to that model of monolingual 
retrieval, it can be shown that 
p(Q \[ D is R) = I I  (aP(W \[ Gx) + (1- a)e(w ID)), 
W inQ 
where W's are query words in Q. Miller et al 
estimated probabilities as follows: 
* The transition probability a is 0.7 using the 
EM algorithm (Rabiner, 1989) on the TREC4 
ad-hoc query set. 
number of occurrences of W in C x 
? e0e  IGx)= length of Cx 
which is the general language probability for 
word W in language x.
number of occurrences of W in D 
? e (WlD)  = 
length of D 
In principle, any large corpus Cx that is 
representative of language x can be used in 
computing the general language probabilities. 
In practice, the collection to be searched is
used for that purpose. The length of a

3 HMM for Cross-lingual IR 
For CLIR we extend the query generation 
process o that a document Dy written in 
language y can generate a query Qx in language 
x. We use Wx to denote aword in x and Wy to 
denote aword in y. As before, to model general 
query words from language x, we estimate P(Wx 
\]Gx) by using a large corpus Cx in language x.
Also as before, we estimate P(WyIDy) to be the 
sample distribution of Wy in Dy. 
We use P(Wx\[Wy) to denote the probability that 
Wy is translated as Wx. Though terms often 
should not be translated independent of their 
context, we make that simplifying assumption 
here. We assume that the possible translations 
are specified by a bilingual lexicon BL. Since 
the event spaces for Wy's in P(WyIDy) are 
mutually exclusive, we can compute the output 
probability P(WxIDy): 
P(WxIDy)= ~P(WylDy)P(WxIWy)  
W inBL y 
We compute P(Q~IDy is R) as below: 
P(Qx IDr /sR) = I~I(aetwx IG,)+O-a)P(W~ IDy)) 
w.~,o. 
The above model generates queries from 
documents, that is, it attempts o determine how 
likely a particular query is given a relevant 
document. The retrieval system, however, can 
use either query translation or document 
translation. We chose query translation over 
document translation for its flexibility, since it 
allowed us to experiment with a new method of 
estimating the translation probabilities without 
changing the index structure. 
4 Experimental Set-up 
For retrieval using English queries to search 
Chinese documents, we used the TREC5 and 
TREC6 Chinese data which consists of 164,789 
documents from the Xinhua News Agency and 
People's Daily, averaging 450 Chinese 
characters/document. Each of the TREC topics 
has three Chinese fields: title, description and 
96 
narrative, plus manually translated, English 
versions of each. We corrected some of the 
English queries that contained errors, such as 
"Dali Lama" instead of the correct "Dalai Lama" 
and "Medina" instead of "Medellin." Stop 
words and stop phrases were removed. We 
created three versions of Chinese queries and 
three versions of English queries: short (title 
only), medium (title and description), and long 
(all three fields). 
For retrieval using English queries to search 
Spanish documents, we used the TREC4 
Spanish data, which has 57,868 documents. It 
has 25 queries in Spanish with manual 
translations toEnglish. We will denote the 
Chinese data sets as Trec5C and Trec6C and the 
Spanish data set as Trec4S. 
We used a Chinese-English lexicon from the 
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We pre- 
processed the dictionary as follows: 
1. Stem Chinese words via a simple algorithm 
to remove common suffixes and prefixes. 
2. Use the Porter stemmer on English words. 
3. Split English phrases into words. If an 
English phrase is a translation for a Chinese 
word, each word in the phrase is taken as a 
separate translation for the Chinese word. ~ 
4. Estimate the translation probabilities. (We 
first report results assuming a uniform 
distribution on a word's translations. If a 
Chinese word c has n translations el, e2, ...en. 
each of them will be assigned equal probability, 
i.e., P(ei lc)=l/n.  Section 10 supplements this 
with a corpus-based distribution.) 
5. Invert he lexicon to make it an English- 
Chinese lexicon. That is, for each English word 
e, we associate it with a list of Chinese words cl, 
c2, ... Cm together with non-zero translation 
probabilities P( elc~). 
The resulting English-Chinese l xicon has 
80,000 English words. On average, each 
English word has 2.3 Chinese translations. 
For Spanish, we downloaded a bilingual 
English-Spanish lexicon from the Internet 
(http://www.activa.arrakis.es) containing around 
22,000 English words (16,000 English stems) 
and processed it similarly. Each English word 
has around 1.5 translations on average. A co- 
occurrence based stemmer (Xu and Croft, 1998) 
was used to stem Spanish words. One 
difference from the treatment of Chinese is to 
include the English word as one of its own 
translations in addition to its Spanish 
translations in the lexicon. This is useful for 
translating proper nouns, which often have 
identical spellings in English and Spanish but 
are routinely excluded from a lexicon. 
One problem is the segmentation f Chinese 
text, since Chinese has no spaces between 
words. In these initial experiments, we relied on 
a simple sub-string matching algorithm to 
extract words from Chinese text. To extract 
words from a string of Chinese characters, the 
algorithm examines any sub-string of length 2 or 
greater and recognizes it as a Chinese word if it 
is in a predefined dictionary (the LDC lexicon in 
our case). In addition, any single character 
which is not part of any recognized Chinese 
words in the first step is taken as a Chinese 
word. Note that this algorithm can extract a
compound Chinese word as well as its 
components. For example, the Chinese word for 
"particle physics" as well as the Chinese words 
for "particle" and "physics" will be extracted. 
This seems desirable because it ensures the 
retrieval algorithm will match both the 
compound words as well as their components. 
The above algorithm was used in processing 
Chinese documents and Chinese queries. 
English data from the 2 GB of TREC disks l&2 
was used to estimate P(WlG,..ngti~h), the general 
language probabilities for English words. The 
evaluation metric used in this study is the 
average precision using the trec_eval program 
(Voorhees and Harman, 1997). Mono-lingual 
retrieval results (using the Chinese and Spanish 
queries) provided our baseline, with the HMM 
retrieval system (Miller et al 1999). 
1 Clearly, this is not correct; however, it 
simplified implementation.

5 Retrieval Results 
Table 2 reports average precision for mono- 
lingual retrieval, average precision for cross- 
lingual, and the relative performance ratio of 
cross-lingual retrieval to mono-lingual. 
Relative performance of cross-lingual IR varies 
between 67% and 84% of mono-lingual IR. 
Trec6 Chinese queries have a somewhat higher 
relative performance than Trec5 Chinese 
queries. Longer queries have higher elative 
performance than short queries in general. 
Overall, cross-lingual performance using our 
HMM retrieval model is around 76% of mono- 
lingual retrieval. A comparison of our mono- 
lingual results with Trec5 Chinese and Trec6 
Chinese results published in the TREC 
proceedings (Voorhees and Harman, 1997, 
1998) shows that our mono-lingual results are 
close to the top performers in the TREC 
conferences. Our Spanish mono-lingual 
performance is also comparable tothe top 
automatic runs of the TREC4 Spanish task 
(Harrnan, 1996). Since these mono-lingual 
results were obtained without using 
sophisticated query processing techniques such 
as query expansion, we believe the mono-lingual 
results form a valid baseline.

6 Comparison with other Methods 
In this section we compare our approach with 
two other approaches. One approach is "simple 
substitution", i.e., replacing a query term with 
all its translations and treating the translated 
query as a bag of words in mono-lingual 
retrieval. Suppose we have a simple query 
Q=(a, b), the translations for a are al, a2, a3, and 
the translations for b are bl, b2. The translated 
query would be (at, a2, a3, b~, b2). Since all terms 
are treated as equal in the translated query, this 
gives terms with more translations (potentially 
the more common terms) more credit in 
retrieval, even though such terms hould 
potentially be given less credit if they are more 
common. Also, a document matching different 
translations ofone term in the original query 
may be ranked higher than a document that 
matches translations ofdifferent terms in the 
original query. That is, a document that 
contains terms at, a2 and a3 may be ranked 
higher than a document which contains terms at 
and bl. However, the second ocument is more 
likely to be relevant since correct translations of
the query terms are more likely to co-occur 
(Ballesteros and Croft, 1998). 
A second method is to structure the translated 
query, separating the translations for one term 
from translations for other terms. This approach 
limits how much credit he retrieval algorithm 
can give to a single term in the original query 
and prevents the translations ofone or a few 
terms from swamping the whole query. There 
are several variations of such a method 
(Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Pirkola, 1998; Hull 
1997). One such method is to treat different 
translations ofthe same term as synonyms. 
Ballesteros, for example, used the INQUERY 
(Callan et al 1995) synonym operator to group 
translations ofdifferent query terms. However, 
if a term has two translations inthe target 
language, it will treat hem as equal even though 
one of them is more likely to be the correct 
translation than the other. By contrast, our 
HMM approach supports translation 
probabilities. The synonym approach is
equivalent to changing all non-zero translation 
probabilities P(W~\[ Wy)'s to 1 in our retrieyal 
function. Even estimating uniform translation 
probabilities gives higher weights to 
unambiguous translations and lower weights to 
highly ambiguous translations. 
98 
These intuitions are supported empirically by the 
results in Table 3. We can see that the HMM 
performs best for every query set. Simple 
substitution performs worst. The synonym 
approach is significantly better than substitution, 
but is consistently worse than the HMM 
translations were kept in disambiguation, the 
improvement would be 4% for Trec6C-medium. 
The results of this manual disambiguation 
suggest that there are limits to automatic 
disambiguation.

Trec4S 0.0935 0.1594 0.1729 
Table 3: Comparing different methods of 
query translation. All numbers are average 
precision. 
7 Impact of Translation Ambiguity 
To get an upper bound on performance ofany 
disambiguation technique, we manually 
disambiguated the Trec5C-medium, Trec6C- 
medium and Trec4S queries. That is, for each 
English query term, a native Chinese or Spanish 
speaker scanned the list of translations in the 
bilingual exicon and kept one translation 
deemed to be the best for the English term and 
discarded the rest. If none of the translations 
was correct, the first one was chosen. 
The results in Table 4 show that manual 
disambiguation improves performance by 17% 
on Trec5C, 4% on Trec4S, but not at all on 
Trec6C. Furthermore, the improvement on 
Trec5C appears to be caused by big 
improvements for a small number of queries. 
The one-sided t-test (Hull, 1993) at significance 
level 0.05 indicated that the improvement on 
Trec5C is not statistically significant. 
It seems urprising that disambiguation does not 
help at all for Trec6C. We found that many 
terms have more than one valid translation. For 
example, the word "flood" (as in "flood 
control") has 4 valid Chinese translations. Using 
all of them achieves the desirable ffect of query 
expansion. It appears that for Trec6C, the benefit 
of disambiguation is cancelled by choosing only 
one of several alternatives, discarding those 
other good translations. If multiple correct

8 Impact of Missing Translations 
Results in the previous ection showed that 
manual disambiguation can bring performance 
of cross-lingual IR to around 82% of mono- 
lingual IR. The remaining performance gap 
between mono-lingual nd cross-lingual IR is 
likely to be caused by the incompleteness of the 
bilingual exicon used for query translation, i.e., 
missing translations for some query terms. This 
may be a more serious problem for cross-lingual 
IR than ambiguity. To test the conjecture, for 
each English query term, a native speaker in 
Chinese or Spanish manually checked whether 
the bilingual exicon contains acorrect 
translation for the term in the context of the 
query. If it does not, a correct ranslation for the 
term was added to the lexicon. For the query 
sets Trec5C-medium and Trec6C-medium, there 
are 100 query terms for which the lexicon does 
not have a correct ranslation. This represents 
19% of the 520 query terms (a term is counted 
only once in one query). For the query set 
Trec4S, the percentage is 12%. 
The results in Table 5 show that with augmented 
lexicons, performance of cross-lingual IR is 
91%, 99% and 95% of mono-lingual IR on 
Trec5C-mediurn, Trec6C-medium and Trec4S. 
99 
The improvement over using the original exicon 
is 28%, 18% and 23% respectively. The results 
demonstrate the importance cff a complete 
lexicon. Compared with the results in section 7, 
the results here suggest that missing translations 
have a much larger impact on cross-lingual IR 
than translation ambiguity does.

9 Impact of  Lexicon Size 
In this section we measure CLIR performance as
a function of lexicon size. We sorted the 
English words from TREC disks l&2 in order of 
decreasing frequency. For a lexicon of size n, 
we keep only the n most frequent English words. 
The upper graph in Figure 1 shows the curve of 
cross-lingual IR performance asa function of the 
size of the lexicon based on the Chinese short 
and medium-length queries. Retrieval 
performance was averaged over Trec5C and 
Trec6C. Initially retrieval performance increases 
sharply with lexicon size. After the dictionary 
exceeds 20,000, performance l vels off. An 
examination of the translated queries hows that 
words not appearing in the 20,000-word lexicon 
usually do not appear in the larger lexicons 
either. Thus, increases in the general lexicon 
beyond 20,000 words did not result in a 
substantial increase in the coverage of the query 
terms. 
The lower graph in Figure 1 plots the retrieval 
performance asa function of the percent of the 
full lexicon. The figure shows that short queries 
are more susceptible toincompleteness of the 
lexicon than longer queries. Using a 7,000-word 
lexicon, the short queries only achieve 75% of 
their performance with the full lexicon. In 
comparison, the medium-length queries achieve 
87% of their performance.

We categorized the missing terms and found that 
most of them are proper nouns (especially 
locations and person ames), highly technical 
terms, or numbers. Such words understandably 
do not normally appear in traditional lexicons. 
Translation of numbers can be solved using 
simple rules. Transliteration, a technique that 
guesses the likely translations of a word based 
on pronunciation, can be readily used in 
translating proper nouns. 
Another technique is automatic discovery of 
translations from parallel or non-parallel corpora 
(Fung and Mckeown, 1997). Since traditional 
lexicons are more or less static repositories of 
knowledge, techniques that discover translation 
from newly published materials can supplement 
them with corpus-specific vocabularies. 
100 
10 Using a Parallel Corpus 
In this section we estimate translation 
probabilities from a parallel corpus rather than 
assuming uniform likelihood as in section 4. A 
Hong Kong News corpus obtained from the 
Linguistic Data Consortium has 9,769 news 
stories in Chinese with English translations. It
has 3.4 million English words. Since the 
documents are not exact ranslations of each 
other, occasionally having extra or missing 
sentences, we used document-level co- 
occurrence toestimate translation probabilities. 
The Chinese documents were "segmented" using 
the technique discussed in section 4. Let co(e,c) 
be the number of parallel documents where an 
English word e and a Chinese word c co-occur, 
and df(c) be the document frequency of c. If a 
Chinese word c has n possible translations el to 
en in the bilingual exicon, we estimate the 
corpus translation probability as: 
co(e i , c) 
P_  corpus(ell c) = 
i=n 
MAX(df (c ) ,  ~ co(e i, c)) 
i=1 
Since several translations for c may co-occur in 
a document, ~co(e~ c) can be greater than df(c). 
Using the maximum of the two ensures that 
E P_corpus(eilc)_<l. 
Instead of relying solely on corpus-based 
estimates from a small parallel corpus, we 
employ a mixture model as follows: 
P( e I c) = ~ P _ corpus( eI c) + (1- #)P_ lexicon( e\[ c) 
The retrieval results in Table 6 show that 
combining the probability estimates from the 
lexicon and the parallel corpus does improve 
retrieval performance. The best results are 
obtained when 13=0.7; this is better than using 
uniform probabilities by 9% on Trec5C-medium 
and 4% on Trec6C-medium. Using the corpus 
probability estimates alone results in a 
significant drop in performance, the parallel 
corpus is not large enough nor diverse nough 
for reliable stimation of the translation 
probabilities. In fact, many words do not appear 
in the corpus at all. With a larger and better 
parallel corpus, more weight should be given to 
the probability estimates from the corpus.

11 Related Work 
Other studies which view IR as a query 
generation process include Maron and Kuhns, 
1960; Hiemstra nd Kraaij, 1999; Ponte and 
Croft, 1998; Miller et al 1999. Our work has 
focused on cross-lingual retrieval. 
Many approaches tocross-lingual IR have been 
published. One common approach is using 
Machine Translation (MT) to translate the 
queries to the language of the documents or 
translate documents othe language of the 
queries (Gey et al 1999; Oard, 1998). For most 
languages, there are no MT systems at all. Our 
focus is on languages where no MT exists, but a 
bilingual dictionary may exist or may be 
derived. 
Another common approach is term translation, 
e.g., via a bilingual exicon. (Davis and Ogden, 
1997; Ballesteros and Croft, 1997; Hull and 
Grefenstette, 1996). While word sense 
disambiguation has been a central topic in 
previous tudies for cross-lingual IR, our study 
suggests that using multiple weighted 
translations and compensating for the 
incompleteness of the lexicon may be more 
valuable. Other studies on the value of 
disambiguation for cross-lingual IR include 
Hiernstra nd de Jong, 1999; Hull, 1997. 
Sanderson, 1994 studied the issue of 
disarnbiguation for mono-lingual IR. 
101 
The third approach to cross-lingual retrieval is to 
map queries and documents o some 
intermediate r presentation, e.g latent semantic 
indexing (LSI) (Littman et al 1998), or the 
General Vector space model (GVSM), 
(Carbonell et al 1997). We believe our 
approach is computationally ess costly than 
(LSI and GVSM) and assumes less resources 
(WordNet in Diekema et al, 1999). 
12 Conclusions and Future Work 
We proposed an approach to cross-lingual IR 
based on hidden Markov models, where the 
system estimates the probability that a query in 
one language could be generated from a 
document in another language. Experiments 
using the TREC5 and TREC6 Chinese test sets 
and the TREC4 Spanish test set show the 
following: 
? Our retrieval model can reduce the 
performance d gradation due to translation 
ambiguity This had been a major limiting 
factor for other query-translation 
approaches. 
? Some earlier studies uggested that query 
translation is not an effective approach to 
cross-lingual IR (Carbonell et al 1997). 
However, our results uggest that query 
translation can be effective particularly if a 
bilingual dictionary is the primary bilingual 
resource available. 
? Manual selection from the translations in the 
bilingual dictionary improves performance 
little over the HMM. 
? We believe an algorithm cannot rule out a 
possible translation with absolute 
confidence; it is more effective to rely on 
probability estimation/re-estimation to 
differentiate likely translations and unlikely 
translations. 
? Rather than translation ambiguity, a more 
serious limitation to effective cross-lingual 
IR is incompleteness of the bilingual exicon 
used for query translation. 
? Cross-lingual IR performance is typically 
75% that of mono-lingual for our HMM on 
the Chinese and Spanish collections. 
Future improvements in cross-lingual IR will 
come by attacking the incompleteness of 
bilingual dictionaries and by improved query 
expansion and context-dependent translation. 
Our current model assumes that query terms are 
generated one at time. We would like to extend 
the model to allow phrase generation i the 
query generation process. We also wish to 
explore techniques to extend bilingual exicons.
