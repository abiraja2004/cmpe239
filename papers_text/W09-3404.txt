Abstract 
In this paper, two corpora of Urdu (with 110K 
and 120K words) tagged with different POS 
tagsets are used to train TnT and Tree taggers. 
Error analysis of both taggers is done to identi-
fy frequent confusions in tagging. Based on 
the analysis of tagging, and syntactic structure 
of Urdu, a more refined tagset is derived.  The 
existing tagged corpora are tagged with the 
new tagset to develop a single corpus of 230K 
words and the TnT tagger is retrained.  The re-
sults show improvement in tagging accuracy 
for individual corpora to 94.2% and also for 
the merged corpus to 91%.  Implications of 
these results are discussed.    
1 Introduction 
There is increasing amount of work on computa-
tional modeling of Urdu language.  As various 
groups work on the language, diversity in analy-
sis is also developed.  In this context, there has 
been some work on Urdu part of speech (POS) 
tagging, which has caused multiple tagsets to 
appear.  Thus, there is also need to converge 
these efforts.  
Current work compares the existing tag-
sets of Urdu being used for tagging corpora in an 
attempt to look at the differences, and understand 
the reasons for the variation.  The work then un-
dertakes experiments to develop a common tag-
set, which is syntactically and computationally 
coherent.  The aim is to make a robust tagset and 
then to port the differently tagged Urdu corpora 
onto the same tagset.  As Urdu already has very 
few annotated corpora, this will help consolidat-
ing them for better modeling. 
The next sections present the existing tag-
sets and accuracies of the POS taggers reported 
using them. Sections 4 and 5 present baseline 
experiment and the methodology used for the 
analysis for updating the tagset. Section 6 de-
scribes the proposed tagset. Section 7 reports 
experiments comparing the new tagset with ex-
isting ones. Section 8 discusses the results 
achieved and future directions. 
2 Relevant  Resources of Urdu 
2.1 Urdu Corpora  
Several annotated corpora have been built during 
last few years to facilitate computational 
processing for Urdu language.  The initial work 
was undertaken through EMILLE project to 
build multi-lingual corpora for South Asian lan-
guages (McEnery et al, 2000). They released 
200,000 words parallel corpus of English, Urdu, 
Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi. In addition, 
there are 1,640,000 words of Urdu text in this 
corpus. These text collections are also annotated 
with part of speech tags (Hardie 2003).  
Center for Research in Urdu Language 
Processing (CRULP1) gathered 18 million words 
corpus in order to build a lexicon. It has cleaned 
text from news websites from multiple domains 
(Ijaz et.al. 2007).  Following this work, a syntac-
tic tagset was developed based on work by exist-
ing grammarians and a corpus of 110,000 words 
was manually tagged. This annotated corpus is 
available through the center (Sajjad 2007, Hus-
sain 2008). 
Recently an English-Urdu parallel cor-
pus has also been developed by CRULP, by 
translating the first 140,000 words of PENN 
Treebank corpus. In addition, a tagset has also 
been designed following the PENN Treebank 
guidelines. These words have been tagged ma-
nually with this new tagset. This collection is 
also available from CRULP, and the tagset is still 
unpublished.  
2.2 Urdu Part of Speech tagsets 
Hardie (2003) developed the first POS tagset for 
Urdu using EAGLES guidelines for computa-
tional processing. The tagset contains 282 mor-
pho-syntactic tags, differentiating on the basis of 
number, gender and other morphological details

in addition to the syntactic categories. Punctua-
tion marks are tagged as they are, and not in-
cluded in 282 tags. The tags include the gender 
and number agreement, in addition to syntactic 
information.  
The complications of Urdu tagset design 
are also discussed. One of these complexities is 
word segmentation issue of the language. Suffix-
es in Urdu are written with an orthographic 
space. Words are separated on the basis of space 
and so suffixes are treated same as lexical words. 
Hence it is hard to assign accurate tag for an au-
tomatic tagger. Although the tagset is designed 
considering details, but due to larger number of 
tags it is hard to get a high accuracy with a small 
sized corpus. Due to its morphological depen-
dence and its large size, this tagset is not consi-
dered in our analysis.   
Two much smaller tagsets are considered 
for this work.  They are compared in detail in 
Section 6.  The first tagset, containing 42 tags, is 
designed by Sajjad (2007), based on the work of 
Urdu grammarians (e.g. Schmidt 1999, Haq 
1987, Javed 1981, Platts 1909) and computation-
al work by Hardie (2003). The main features of 
the tagset include multiple pronouns (PP, KP, 
AKP, AP, RP, REP, G, and GR) and demonstra-
tives (PD, KD, AD, and RD). It has only one tag 
for all forms of verbs (VB), except for auxiliaries 
to show aspect (AA) and tense (TA) information 
about the verb. All noun types are assigned sin-
gle tag (NN) except for Proper Nouns (PN). It 
also has a special tag NEG to mark any occur-
rence negation words (?Yl? ?not? and ?? ?no? or 
?neither?) regardless of context. It also has a tag 
SE to mark every occurrence of ?5 (?from?) 
without considering the context. Another exam-
ple of such a context-free lexical tag is WALA to 
mark every occurrence (including all the inflec-
tions) of the word ???. This tagset is referred to as 
T1 subsequently in this paper.   
Recently Sajjad and Schmid (2009) used 
the tagged data of 107,514 words and carried out 
an experiment for tagger comparison.  A total of 
100,000 words are used as training set and rest as 
test data. Four taggers (TnT, Tree, RF and SVM) 
are trained using training corpus and then tested 
accordingly. Reported results of this work show 
that SVM tagger is the most accurate, showing 
94.15% correct prediction of tags. Remaining 
three taggers have accuracies of 93.02% (Tree 
tagger), 93.28% (RF tagger) and 93.40% (TnT 
tagger).   
 
Another tagset has recently been devel-
oped as a part of a project to develop English-
Urdu parallel corpus at CRULP, following the 
Penn Treebank guidelines (Santorini 1990).  It 
contains 46 tags, with fewer grades of pronouns 
(PR, PRP$, PRRF, PRRFP$, and PRRL) and 
demonstratives (DM and DMRL), as compared 
to T1. It has several tags for verbs on the basis of 
their forms and semantics (VB, VBI, VBL, 
VBLI, and VBT) in addition to the tags for aux-
iliaries showing aspect (AUXA) and tense 
(AUXT). The NN tag is assigned for both singu-
lar and plural nouns and includes adverbial kaf 
pronoun, kaf pronoun, and adverbial pronoun 
categories of T1. Yet, it has several other grades 
of common nouns (NNC, NNCR, NNCM). It 
also has two shades of Proper Nouns (NNP, 
NNPC), which are helpful in identifying phrase 
boundary of compound proper nouns. It also has 
a tag WALA that is assigned to every occurrence 
(and inflection) of word ??? )wala( . However, 
marking of token ?5 (?from?) is context depen-
dent: either it is CM when marking case or it is 
RBRP when occurring as an adverbial particle. 
This tagset is referred to as T2 subsequently in 
this paper. 
3 Tools and Resource Selection 
The decision of selecting the tagger, the tagset, 
and the data is the starting point for the task of 
POS tagging. This section gives details of the 
taggers chosen and the corpora used for the expe-
riments conducted.  
3.1 Selection of taggers 
There are a number of existing taggers available 
for tagging.  Two POS taggers are used in the 
initial step of this work to compare the initial 
tagging accuracies. 
 One of the selected taggers is Trigram-
and-Tag (TnT).  It is a trigram based HMM tag-
ger in which two preceding tags are used to find 
the transition probability of a tag. Brants (2000) 
tested PENN Treebank (English) and NEGRA 
(German) corpora and reported 96-97% accuracy 
of the tagger.  
Schmid (1994) proposed probabilistic 
POS tagger that uses decision trees to store the 
transition probabilities. The trained decision tree 
is used for identification of highest probable tags. 
Schmid reported an accuracy of 95-96% on 
PENN Treebank for this tagger. 
25
 
 
Both taggers give good accuracy for Ur-
du tagging, as reported by Sajjad and Schmid 
(2009). 
3.2 Data Used for Experimentation 
Corpora annotated with the different tagsets are 
acquired from CRULP. The corpus originally 
tagged with T1 tagset is referred to as C1 (news 
from non-business domain) and the corpus in-
itially annotated with T2 tagset is referred to as 
C2 (news from business domain), subsequently 
in the current work. Both C1 and C2 are taken 
and cleaned. The data is re-counted and approx-
imately 100,000 words are separated for training 
and rest are kept for testing.  The details of data 
are given in Tables 1 and 2 below.

4 Baseline Estimation 
The comparison is initiated with training of ex-
isting tagsets on their respective annotated data 
(T1 on C1 and T2 on C2). Both corpora are 
tested on TnT and Tree Tagger to obtain the con-
fusion matrices for errors. These confusion ma-
trices are used to analyze misclassification of 
tags. TnT tagger shows that overall accuracy of 
using T1 with C1 is 93.01% and is significantly 
better than using T2 with C2, which gives 
88.13% accuracy.  Tree tagger is also trained on 
the corpora. The overall accuracy of T1 on C1 
(93.37%) is better than that of T2 on C2 
(90.49%).  The results are shown in Table 3. 
 
Table 3. Results of both tagsets on their respec-
tive corpora with TnT and Tree taggers 
 
  T1 on C1 T2 on C2 
TnT Tagger 93.01% 88.13% 
Tree Tagger 93.37% 90.49% 
 
The accuracies reported (for T1 on C1) by 
Sajjad and Schmid (2009) are comparable to 
these accuracies. They have reported 93.40% for 
TnT Tagger and 93.02% for Tree Tagger. 
Further experimentation is performed only 
using TnT tagger.  
5 Methodology 
The current work aims to build a larger corpus of 
around 230,000 manually tagged words for Urdu 
by combining C1 and C2. These collections are 
initially annotated with two different tagsets (T1 
and T2 respectively, and as described above). 
For this unification, it was necessary to indentify 
the differences in the tagsets on which these cor-
pora are annotated, analyzed the differences and 
then port them to unified tagset. 
The work starts with the baseline estimation 
(described in Section 4 above). The results of 
baseline estimation are used to derive a new tag-
set (detailed in Section 6 below), referred to as 
T3 in this paper. Then a series of experiments are 
executed to compare the performance of three 
tagsets (T1, T2, and T3) on data from two differ-
ent domains (C1 and C2), as reported in Section 
7 below and summarized in Table 4.

The performance of T1 on C1 is already 
better than T2 on C2, so the first comparison for 
the merged tagset T3 is with T1 on C1, which is 
the basis of the first experiment. Then the per-
formance of better performing tagsets (T1 and 
T3) are compared on the corpus C2 in the second 
26
 
 
experiment to compare them with T2. One possi-
ble reason of relatively better performance could 
be the difference in application of open classes 
for unknown words in the test data. Therefore, 
the third experiment is performed using the same 
data as in second experiment (i.e. corpus C2) 
with combined lexicon of training and test data 
(i.e. no unknown words). Finally, an experiment 
is conducted with the merged corpus. Following 
table summarizes these experiments. 
6 Tagset design 
After establishing the baseline, the existing tag-
sets are reviewed with the following guidelines: 
? Focus on the syntactic variation (instead of 
morphological or semantic motivation) to ei-
ther collapse existing tags or introduce new 
ones 
? Focus on word level tagging and not try to ac-
commodate phrase level tagging (e.g. to sup-
port chunking, compounding or other similar 
tasks) 
? Tag according to the syntactic role instead of 
having a fixed tag for a string, where possible 
? Use PENN Treebank nomenclature to keep the 
tagset easy to follow and share 
 
Comparison of T1 and T2 showed that there 
are 33 tags in both tagsets which represent same 
syntactic categories, as shown in Appendix A. 
The tag I (Intensifier) in T2 labels the words 
which are marked as ADV in T1. The words an-
notated as NNC, NNCR and NNCM (under T2) 
are all labeled as NN under T1. The words 
tagged as VBL, VBLI, VBI, and VBLI (under 
T2) are all labeled as VB under T1. Range of 
distinct tags for demonstratives of T1 are all 
mapped to DM in T2 except RD (of T1) which 
maps to DMRL (of T2). 
In order to identify the issues in tagging, a 
detailed error analysis of existing tagsets is per-
formed. Following tables represent the major tag 
confusions for tagging C2 with T2 using Tree 
and TnT taggers.

The proposed tagset for Urdu part-of-
speech tagging contains 32 tags. The construc-
tion of new tagset (T3) is initiated by adopting 
T2 as the baseline, because T2 uses the tagging 
conventions of PENN Treebank. There are 17 
tags in T3 that are same as in T1 and T2. These 
tags (CC, CD, DM, DMRL, JJ, NN, OD, PM, 
PRP, PRP$, PRRF, PRRF$, PRRL, Q, RB, SM, 
SYM) are not discussed in detail. The complete 
tagset alng with short description and examples 
of each tag is given in Appendix B. 
RBRP (Adverbial Particle) and CM 
(Case Marker) are merged to make up a new tag 
PP (Postposition), so every postposition particle 
comes under this new tag ignoring semantic con-
text. I (Intensifier) is used to mark the intensifi-
cation of an adjective, which is a semantic grada-
tion, and syntactically merged with Q (Quantifi-
er). NNCM (Noun after Case Marker), NNC 
(Noun Continuation), NNCR (Continuing Noun 
Termination) are merged into NN (Noun) be-
cause syntactically they always behave similarly 
and the difference is motivated by phrase level 
marking.   U (Unit) is also merged with NN be-
cause the difference is semantically motivated.   
DATE is not syntactic, and may be either 
treated as NN (Noun) or CD (Cardinal), depend-
ing upon the context. Similarly, R (Reduplica-
tion), MOPE (Meaningless Pre-word), and MO-
PO (Meaningless Post-word) always occur in 
pair with NN, JJ, or another tag.  Thus they are 
phrasal level tags, and can be replaced by rele-
vant word level tag in context. NNPC (Proper 
Noun Continuation) tag identifies compounding 
but syntactically behaves as NNP (Proper Noun), 
and is not used.  
VBL (Light Verb) is used in complex predi-
cates (Butt 1995), but its syntactic similarity with 
VB (Verb) is a major source of confusion in au-
tomatic tagging.  It is collapsed with VB (Verb). 
Similarly, VBLI (Light Verb Infinitive) is 
merged with VBI (Verb Infinitive). AUXT 
(Tense Auxiliary) is highly misclassified as VBT 
(To be Verb) because both occur as last token in 
a clause or sentence, and both include tense in-
27
 
 
formation. The word is labeled as VBT only 
when there is no other verb in the sentence or 
clause, otherwise these words are tagged as 
AUXT. The syntactic similarity of both tags is 
also evident from statistically misclassifying 
AUXT as VBT.  Therefore both are collapsed 
into single tag VBT (Tense Verb). 
In T1, NEG (Negation) is used to mark all 
the negation words without context, but they 
mostly occur as adverbs.  Therefore, NEG tag is 
removed. Similarly, SE (Postposition ?5 , 
?from?) is not separated from postpositions and 
marked accordingly. PRT (Pre-Title) and POT 
(Post-Title) always occur before or after Proper 
Noun, respectively. Therefore, they behave as 
Proper Nouns, hence proposed to be labeled as 
NNP (Proper Noun). 
7 Experiments 
After designing a new tagset, a series of experi-
ments are conducted to investigate the proposed 
changes. The rationale of the sequence of expe-
riments has been discussed in Section 5 above, 
however the reasoning for each experiment is 
also given below. As T2 tags have much more 
semantic and phrasal information, and C2 tagged 
with T2 shows lower accuracy than T1 on C1, 
therefore further experiments are conducted to 
compare the performance of T1 and T3 only.  
Comparisons on C2 with T3 may also be drawn. 
7.1 Experiment 1 
As baseline estimation shows that T1 on C1 out-
performs T2 on C2, the first experiment is to 
compare the performance of T3 on C1. In this 
experiment C1 is semi-automatically tagged with 
T3. TnT tagger is then trained and tested. T3 
gives 93.44% accuracy, which is slightly better 
than the results already obtained for T1 
(93.01%). The results are summarized in Table 7. 
 
Table 7. Accuracies of T3 and T1 on C1  
 
Corpus Tagset Accuracy
C1 T3 93.44% 
C1 T1 93.01% 
7.2 Experiment 2 
Now to test the effect of change in domain of the 
corpus, the performance T1 and T3 on C2 is 
compared in this experiment. C2 is manually 
tagged with T3, then trained and tested using 
TnT tagger. The results obtained with T3 are 
91.98%, which are significantly better than the 
results already obtained for T2 on C2 (88.13%). 
C2 is also semi-automatically re-tagged 
with T1. T1 shows better performance (91.31%) 
than T2 (88.13%). However, the accuracy of us-
ing T3 (on C2) is still slightly higher.  The re-
sults are summarized in Table 8.

cies of T3 and T1 on C2 
 
Corpus Tagset Accuracy 
C2 T3 91.98% 
C2 T1 91.31% 
7.3 Experiment 3 
Due to the change in open class set there may be 
a difference of performance on unknown words, 
therefore in this experiment, all the unknown 
words of test set are also included in the vocabu-
lary. This experiment again involves T3 and T1 
with C2. Combined lexica are built using testing 
and training parts of the corpus, to eliminate the 
factor of unknown words. This experiment also 
shows that T3 performs better than T1, as shown 
in Table 9. 
 
Table 9. Accuracies of T3 and T1 with ALL 
known words in test data 
 
Corpus Tagset Accuracy 
C2 T3 94.21% 
C2 T1 93.47% 
7.4 Experiment 4 
Finally both corpora (C1 and C2) were com-
bined, forming a training set of 203,882 words 
and a test set of 29,851 words. The lexica are 
generated only from the training set. Then TnT 
tagger is trained separately for both T1 and T3 
tagsets and the accuracies are compared. The 
results show that T3 gives better tagging accura-
cy, as shown in Table 10. 
 
Table 10. Accuracies of T3 and T1 using 
combined C1 and C2 corpora 
 
Corpus Tagset Accuracy 
C1+C2 T3 90.99% 
C1+C2 T1 90.00% 
 
Partial confusion matrices for both the tag-
sets are given in Tables 11 and 12.   
28
 
 
The error analysis shows that the accuracy 
drops for both tagsets when trained on multi-
domain corpus, which is expected.  The highest 
error count is for the confusion between noun 
and adjective.  There is also confusion between 
proper and common nouns.  T3 also gives signif-
icant confusion between personal pronouns and 
demonstratives, as they represent the same lexi-
cal entries.

8 Discussion and Conclusion 
The current work looks at the existing tagsets of 
Urdu being used for tagging corpora and analyz-
es them from two perspectives.  First, the tagsets 
are analyzed to see their linguistic level differ-
ences.  Second, they are compared based on their 
inter-tag confusion after training with two differ-
ent POS taggers.  These analyses are used to de-
rive a more robust tagset.   
The results show that collapsing categories 
which are not syntactically motivated improves 
the tagging accuracy in general.  Specifically, 
light and regular verbs are merged, because they 
may come in similar syntactic frames.  Redupli-
cated categories are given the same category tag 
(instead of a special repetition tag).  Units and 
dates are also not considered separately as the 
differences have been semantically motivated 
and they can be categorized with existing tags at 
syntactic level.   
Though, the measuring unit is currently 
treated as a noun, it could be collapsed as an ad-
jective as well.  The difference is sometimes lex-
ical, where kilogram is more adjectival, vs. 
minute is more nominal in nature in Urdu, 
though both are units.    
NNP (Proper Noun) tag could also have 
been collapsed with NN (Common Noun), as 
Urdu does not make clear between them at syn-
tactic level.  However, these two tags are kept 
separate due to their cross-linguistic importance.  
One may expect that extending the genre or 
domain of corpus reduces accuracy of tagging 
because of increase in the variety in the syntactic 
patterns and diverse use of lexical items. One 
may also expect more accuracy with increase in 
size.  The current results show that effect on ad-
ditional domain (when C1 and C2 are mixed) is 
more pronounced than the increase in size (from 
approximately 100k to 200k), reducing accuracy 
from 94.21% (T3 with C2) to 90.99% (T3 with 
C1 + C2).  The increase in accuracy for T3 vs. 
T1 may be caused by reduced size of T3.  How-
ever, the proposed reduction does not compro-
mise the syntactic word level information, as the 
collapsed categories are where they were either 
semantically motivated or motivated due to 
phrasal level tags. 
The work has been motivated to consolidate 
the existing Urdu corpora annotated with differ-
ent tagsets.  This consolidation will help build 
more robust computational models for Urdu.
