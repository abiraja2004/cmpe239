Abstract
A single word may have multiple un-
specified meanings in a corpus. Word
sense induction aims to discover these dif-
ferent meanings through word use, and
knowledge-lean algorithms attempt this
without using external lexical resources.
We propose a new method for identify-
ing the different senses that uses a flexi-
ble clustering strategy to automatically de-
termine the number of senses, rather than
predefining it. We demonstrate the effec-
tiveness using the SemEval-2 WSI task,
achieving competitive scores on both the
V-Measure and Recall metrics, depending
on the parameter configuration.
1 Introduction
The Word Sense Induction task of SemEval 2010
compares several sense induction and discrimina-
tion systems that are trained over a common cor-
pus. Systems are provided with an unlabeled train-
ing corpus consisting of 879,807 contexts for 100
polysemous words, with 50 nouns and 50 verbs.
Each context consists of several sentences that use
a single sense of a target word, where at least one
sentence contains the word. Systems must use the
training corpus to induce sense representations for
the many word senses and then use those represen-
tations to produce sense labels for the same 100
words in unseen contexts from a testing corpus.
We perform this task by utilizing a distribu-
tional word space formed using dimensionality
reduction and a hybrid clustering method. Our
model is highly scalable; the dimensionality of the
word space is reduced immediately through a pro-
cess based on random projections. In addition, an
online part of our clustering algorithm maintains
only a centroid that describes an induced word
sense, instead of all observed contexts, which lets
the model scale to much larger corpora than those
used in the SemEval-2 WSI task.
2 The Word Sense Induction Model
We perform word sense induction by modeling
individual contexts in a high dimensional word
space. Word senses are induced by finding con-
texts which are similar and therefore likely to use
the same sense of the target word. We use a hybrid
clustering method to group similar contexts.
2.1 Modeling Context
For a word, each of its contexts are represented by
the words with which it co-occurs. We approx-
imate this high dimensional co-occurrence space
with the Random Indexing (RI) word space model
(Kanerva et al, 2000). RI represents the occur-
rence of a word with an index vector, rather than
a set of dimensions. An index vector is a fixed,
sparse vector that is orthogonal to all other words?
index vectors with a high probability; the total
number of dimensions in the model is fixed at a
small value, e.g. 5,000. Orthogonality is obtained
by setting a small percentage of the vector?s values
to ?1 and setting the rest to 0.
A context is represented by summing the index
vectors corresponding to the n words occurring to
the left and right of the polysemous word. Each
occurrence of the polysemous word in the entire
corpus is treated as a separate context. Contexts
are represented by a compact first-order occur-
rence vector; using index vectors to represent the
occurrences avoids the computational overhead of
other dimensional reduction techniques such as
the SVD.
2.2 Identifying Related Contexts
Clustering separates similar context vectors into
dissimilar clusters that represent the distinct
senses of a word. We use an efficient hybrid of
online K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative
359
Clustering (HAC) with a threshold. The thresh-
old allows for the final number of clusters to be
determined by data similarity instead of having to
specify the number of clusters.
The set of context vectors for a word are clus-
tered using K-Means, which assigns a context to
the most similar cluster centroid. If the near-
est centroid has a similarity less than the cluster
threshold and there are not K clusters, the context
forms a new cluster. We define the similarity be-
tween contexts vectors as the cosine similarity.
Once the corpus has been processed, clusters
are repeatedly merged using HAC with the aver-
age link criteria, following (Pedersen and Bruce,
1997). Average link clustering defines cluster sim-
ilarity as the mean cosine similarity of the pair-
wise similarity of all data points from each clus-
ter. Cluster merging stops when the two most sim-
ilar clusters have a similarity less than the clus-
ter threshold. Reaching a similarity lower than the
cluster threshold signifies that each cluster repre-
sents a distinct word sense.
2.3 Applying Sense Labels
Before training and evaluating our model, all
occurrences of the 100 polysemous words were
stemmed in the corpora. Stemming was required
due to a polysemous word being used in multiple
lexical forms, e.g. plural, in the corpora. By stem-
ming, we avoid the need to combine contexts for
each of the distinct word forms during clustering.
After training our WSI model on the training
corpus, we process the test corpus and label the
context for each polysemous word with an induced
sense. Each test context is labeled with the name
of the cluster whose centroid has the highest co-
sine similarity to the context vector. We represent
the test contexts in the same method used for train-
ing; index vectors are re-used from training.
3 Evaluation and Results
The WSI task evaluated the submitted solutions
with two methods of experimentation: an unsuper-
vised method and a supervised method. The unsu-
pervised method is measured according to the V-
Measure and the F-Score. The supervised method
is measured using recall.
3.1 Scoring
The first measure used is the V-Measure (Rosen-
berg and Hirschberg, 2007), which compares the
clusters of target contexts to word classes. This
measure rates the homogeneity and completeness
of a clustering solution. Solutions that have word
clusters formed from one word class are homoge-
neous; completeness measures the degree to which
a word class is composed of target contexts allo-
cated to a single cluster.
The second measure, the F-Score, is an ex-
tension from information retrieval and provides a
contrasting evaluation metric by using a different
interpretation of homogeneity and completeness.
For the F-Score, the precision and recall of all pos-
sible context pairs are measured, where a word
class has the expected context pairs and a provided
solution contains some word pairs that are correct
and others that are unexpected. The F-Score tends
to discount smaller clusters and clusters that can-
not be assigned to a word class (Manandhar et al,
2010).
3.2 Parameter Tuning
Previous WSI evaluations provided a test corpus,
a set of golden sense labels, and a scoring mecha-
nism, which allowed models to do parameter tun-
ing prior to providing a set of sense labels. The
SemEval 2010 task provided a trial corpus that
contains contexts for four verbs that are not in the
evaluation corpus, which can be used for train-
ing and testing. The trial corpus also came with a
set of golden sense assignments. No golden stan-
dard was provided for the training or test corpora,
which limited any parameter tuning.
HERMIT exposes three parameters: cluster
threshold, the maximum number of clusters and
the window size for a context. An initial anal-
ysis from the trial data showed that the window
size most affected the scores; small window sizes
resulted in higher V-Measure scores, while larger
window sizes maximized the F-Score. Because
contexts are represented using only first-order fea-
tures, a smaller window size should have less over-
lap, which potentially results in a higher number
of clusters. We opted to maximize the V-Measure
score by using a window size of ?1.
Due to the limited number of training instances,
our precursory analysis with the trial data did not
show significant differences for the remaining two
parameters; we arbitrarily selected a clustering
threshold of .15 and a maximum of 15 clusters per
word without any parameter tuning.
After the release of the testing key, we per-
360
formed a post-hoc analysis to evaluate the effects
of parameter tuning on the scores. We include two
alternative parameter configurations that were op-
timized for the F-Score (HERMIT-F) and the su-
pervised evaluations (HERMIT-S). The HERMIT-
F variation used a threshold of 0.85 and a win-
dow size of ?10 words. The HERMIT-S variation
used a threshold of 0.85 and a window size of ?1
words. We did not vary the maximum number of
clusters, which was set at 15.
For each evaluation, we provide the scores of
seven systems: the three HERMIT configurations,
the highest and lowest scoring submitted systems,
the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline, and a
Random baseline provided by the evaluation team.
We provide the scores for each experiment when
evaluating all words, nouns, and verbs. We also
include the system?s rank relative to all submitted
systems and the average number of senses gen-
erated for each system; our alternative HERMIT
configurations are given no rank.

Table 2: F-Scores for the unsupervised evaluation
The unsupervised evaluation considers a golden
sense labeling to be word classes and a set of in-
duced word senses as clusters of target contexts
(Manandhar et al, 2010). Tables 1 and 2 display
the results for the unsupervised evaluation when
measured according to the V-Measure and the F-
Score, respectively. Our system provides the best
V-Measure of all submitted systems for this eval-
uation. This is in part due to the average number
of senses our system generated (10.78), which fa-
vors more homogenous clusters. Conversely, this
configuration does poorly when measured by F-
Score, which tends to favor systems that generate
fewer senses per word.
When configured for the F-Score, HERMIT-
F performs well; this configuration would have
ranked third for the F-Score if it had been submit-
ted. However, its performance is also due to the
relatively few senses per word it generates, 1.54.
The inverse performance of both optimized con-
figurations is reflective of the contrasting nature of
the two performance measures.

Table 4: Supervised recall for the 60/40 split
The supervised evaluation simulates a super-
vised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task.
The induced sense labels for the test corpus are
split such that the first set is used for mapping in-
duced senses to golden senses and the remaining
sense labels are treated as sense labels provided
by a WSD system, which allows for evaluation.
Five splits are done at random to avoid any biases
created due to the separation of the mapping cor-
pus and the evaluation corpus; the resulting score
for this task is the average recall over the five di-
visions. Two sets of splits were used for evalua-
tion: one with 80% of the senses as the mapping
portion and 20% as the evaluation portion and one
with 60% as the mapping portion corpus and 40%
for evaluation.
The results for the 80/20 split and 60/40 split
are displayed in tables 3 and 4, respectively. In
both supervised evaluations, our submitted system

does moderately well. In both cases it outperforms
the Random baseline and does almost as well as
the MFS baseline. The submitted system outper-
forms the Random baseline and approaches the
MFS baseline for the 80/20 split. The HERMIT-S
version, which is optimized for this task, provides
similar results.
4 Discussion
The HERMIT system is easily configured to
achieve close to state of the art performance for
either evaluation measure on the unsupervised
benchmark. This reconfigurability allows the al-
gorithm to be tuned for producing a few coarse
senses of a word, or many finer-grained senses.
We further investigated the performance with
respect to the window size parameter on both mea-
sures. Since each score can be effectively opti-
mized individually, we considered whether both
scores could be maximized concurrently. Figure
1 presents the impact of the window size on both
measures using an average of three threshold pa-
rameter configurations.
The analysis of both measures indicates that
reasonable performance can be obtained from us-
ing a slightly larger context window. For ex-
ample, a window size of 4 has an average F-
Score of 52.4 and V-Measure of 7.1. Although
this configuration produces scores lower than the
optimized versions, its performance would have
ranked 12th according to V-Measure and 15th for
F-Score. These scores are consistent with the me-
dian performance of the submitted systems and of-
fer a middle ground should a HERMIT user want
a compromise between many fine-grained word
senses and a few coarse-grained word senses.
5 Conclusion
We have shown that our model is a highly flexi-
ble and tunable Word Sense Induction model. De-
pending on the task, it can be optimized to gen-
erate a set of word senses that range from be-
ing broad and representative to highly refined.
Furthermore, we demonstrated a balanced perfor-
mance setting for both measures for when param-
eter tuning is not possible. The model we sub-
mitted and presented is only one possible config-
uration available, and in the future we will be ex-
ploring the effect of other context features, such
as syntactic structure in the form of word ordering
(Sahlgren et al, 2008) or dependency parse trees,
(Pado? and Lapata, 2007), and other clustering al-
gorithms. Last, this model is provided as part of
the S-Space Package (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010),
an open source toolkit for word space algorithms.
