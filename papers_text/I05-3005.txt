Abstract
Part-of-speech tagging, like any supervised statistical 
NLP task, is more difficult when test sets are very 
different from training sets, for example when tag-
ging across genres or language varieties. We exam-
ined the problem of POS tagging of different 
varieties of Mandarin Chinese (PRC-Mainland, PRC-
Hong Kong, and Taiwan). An analytic study first 
showed that unknown words were a major source of 
difficulty in cross-variety tagging. Unknown words 
in English tend to be proper nouns. By contrast, we 
found that Mandarin unknown words were mostly 
common nouns and verbs. We showed these results 
are caused by the high frequency of morphological 
compounding in Mandarin; in this sense Mandarin is 
more like German than English. Based on this analy-
sis, we propose a variety of new morphological un-
known-word features for POS tagging, extending 
earlier work by others on unknown-word tagging in 
English and German. Our features were implemented 
in a maximum entropy Markov model. Our system 
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Mandarin 
tagging, including improving unknown-word tagging 
performance on unseen varieties in Chinese Treebank 
5.0 from 61% to 80% correct. 
1 Introduction 
Part-of-speech tagging is an important enabling task 
for natural language processing, and state-of-the-art 
taggers perform quite well, when training and test 
data are drawn from the same corpus. Part-of-speech 
tagging is more difficult, however, when a test set is 
drawn from a corpus that includes significantly dif-
ferent varieties of the language. One factor that may 
play a role in this cross-variety difficulty is the pres-
ence of test-set words that were unseen in cross-
variety training sets. 
We chose Mandarin Chinese to study this question of 
cross-variety and unknown-word POS tagging. Man-
darin is both a spoken and a written language; as a 
written language, it is the official written language of 
the PRC (Mainland and Hong Kong), and Taiwan. 
Thus regardless of which dialect people speak at 
home, they write in Mandarin. But the varieties of 
Mandarin written in the PRC (Mainland and Hong 
Kong) and Taiwan differ in orthography, lexicon, 
and even grammar about as much as the British, 
American, and Australian varieties of English (or 
more in some cases). The corpus we use, Chinese 
Treebank 5.0 (Palmer et al, 2005), contains data 
from the three language varieties as well as different 
genres within the varieties. It thus provides a good 
data set for the impact of language variation on tag-
ging performance. 
Previous work on POS tagging of unknown words 
has proposed a number of features based on prefixes 
and suffixes and spelling cues like capitalization 
(Toutanova et al 2003, Brants 2000, Ratnaparkhi 
1996). For example, these systems followed 
Samuelsson (1993) in using n-grams of letter se-
quences ending and starting each word as unknown 
word features. But these features have mainly been 
tested on inflectional languages like English and 
German, whose derivational and inflectional affixes 
tend to be a strong indicator of word classes; Brants 
(2000), for example, showed that an English word 
ending in the suffix -able was very likely to be an 
adjective. Chinese, by contrast, has more than 4000 
frequent affix characters. The amount of training data 
for each affix is thus quite sparse and (as we will 
show later) Chinese affixes are quite ambiguous in 
their part-of-speech identity. Furthermore, it is possi-
ble that n-gram features may not be suited to Chinese 
at all, since Chinese words are much shorter than 
English (averaging 2.4 characters per word compared 
with 7.7 for English, for unknown words in CTB 5.0 
and Wall Street Journal (Marcus et el., 1993)). 
In order to deal with these difficulties, we first per-
formed an analytic study with the goal of understand-
ing the morphological properties of unknown words 
in Chinese. Based on this analysis, we then propose 
new morphological features for addressing the un-
known word problem. We also showed how these 
features could make use of a non-CTB corpus that 
had been labeled with very different POS tags, by 
converting those tags into features.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
The next section is concerned with a corpus analysis 
of cross language variety differences and introduces 
Chinese morphology. In Section 3, we evaluate a 
number of lexical, sequence, and linguistic features. 
Section 4 reviews related work and summarizes our 
contribution.  
2 Data
Chinese Treebank 5.0 (CTB) contains 500K words of 
newspaper and magazine articles annotated with seg-
mentation, part-of-speech, and syntactic constituency 
information. It includes data from three major media 
sources, XH1 from PRC, HKSAR2 from Hong Kong, 
and SM3 from Taiwan. In terms of genre, both XH 
and HKSAR focus on politics and economic issues, 
and SM more on topics such as culture, health, edu-
cation and travel. All of the files in CTB are encoded 
using Guo Biao (GB) and use simplified characters.  
We did some cleanup of character encoding errors in 
CTB before running our experiments. Taiwan and 
Hong Kong still use the traditional forms of charac-
ters, while PRC-Mainland has adopted simplified 
forms of many characters, which also collapse some 
distinctions between characters. Additionally a dif-
ferent character set encoding is standardly used. The 
articles in HKSAR and SM originally used tradi-
tional characters and Big 5 encoding, but prior to 
inclusion in the CTB corpus they had been converted 
into simplified characters and GB. Some errors seem 
to have crept into this conversion process, acciden-
tally leaving traditional characters such as ?  instead 
of simplified ? (after),  ?  for ? (for),  ?? and 
?? and ??  (what), all of which we fixed. We 
also normalized half width numbers, alphabets, and 
punctuation to full width. Finally we removed the -
NONE- traces left over from CTB parse trees.  
3 Corpus analysis 
We begin with an analytic study of potential prob-
lems for POS tagging on cross language variety data.  
3.1 More unknown words across varieties? 
We first test our hypothesis that a test set from a dif-
ferent language variety will contain more unknown 
words. Table 1 has the number of words in our 
devset that were unseen in the XH-only training set 
(we describe our training/dev/test split more fully in 
the next section). The devset contains equal amounts 
of data from all three varieties (XH, HKSAR, and 
SM). As table 1 shows, in data taken from the same

source as the training data (XH), 4.63% of the words 
were unseen in training, compared to the much larger 
numbers of unknown words in the cross-variety data-
sets (14.3% and 16.7%). Some of this difference is 
probably due to genre as well, especially for the out-
lier-genre SM set.

3.2 What are the unknown words? 
In this section, we analyze the part-of-speech charac-
teristics of the unknown words in our devset. 
Table 2 Word class distribution of unknown words in 
devset, XH, HKSAR, SM. Devset represents the conjunc-
tion of the three varieties. CC, DT, LC, P, PN, PU, and SP 
are considered as closed classes by CTB.

VV (other verbs) 497 25 215 257
Total 2849 381 1168 1300
Table 2 shows that the majority of Chinese unknown 
words are common nouns (NN) and verbs (VV). This 
holds both within and across different varieties. Be-
yond the content words, we find that 10.96% and 
21.31% of unknown words are function words in 
HKSAR and SM data. Such unknown function words 
include the determiner gewei (?everybody?), the con-
junction huoshi (?or?), the preposition liantong
(?with?), the pronoun nali (?where?), and symbols 
used as quotes  ??? and ??? (punctuation). XH 
does contain words with similar function (huozhe
33
?or?, yu ?with?, dajia ?everybody?, quotation marks 
???and ???). Our result thus suggests that each 
Mandarin variety may have characteristic function 
words. 
3.3 Cross language comparison 
A key goal of our work is to understand the way that 
unknown words differ across languages. We thus 
compare Chinese, German, and English. Following 
Brants (2000), we extracted 10% of the data from the 
Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal (WSJ 4 ) and 
NEGRA5 (Brants et al, 1999) as observation samples 
to compare to the rest of the corpora. 
In these observation samples, we found that Chinese 
words are more ambiguous in POS than English and 
German; 29.9% of tokens in CTB have more than 
one POS tag, while only 19.8% and 22.9% of tokens 
are ambiguous in English and German, respectively. 
Table 3 shows that 40.6% of unknown words are 
proper nouns6  in English, while both Chinese and 
German have less than 15% of unknown words as 
proper nouns. Unlike English, 60% of the unknown 
words in Chinese and German are verbs and common 
nouns. In the next section we investigate the cause of 
this similarity between Chinese and German un-
known word distribution.

man and Mandarin. The English and German data are ex-
tracted from WSJ and NEGRA. Chinese data is our CTB 
devset.

4 Morphological analysis 
In order to understand the causes of the similarity of 
Chinese and German, and to help suggest possible 
features, we turn here to an introduction to Chinese 
morphology and its implications for part-of-speech 
tagging. 
                                                          
4 WSJ unknown words are those in WSJ 19-21 but unseen in WSJ 
0-18; these are the devset and training set from Toutanova et al 
(2003). 
5 The unknown words of NEGRA are words in a 10% randomly 
extracted set that were unseen in the rest of the corpus. 
6 We treat NNP (proper noun) and NNPS(proper noun plural) as 
proper nouns, NN(noun) and NNS(noun plural) as other nouns, 
and V* as verbs in WSJ. We treat NE (Eigennamen) as proper 
nouns, NN (Normales Nomen) as other nouns, and V* as verbs in 
NEGRA. We treat NR as proper nouns, NN and NT as other nouns, 
and V* as verbs in CTB.  
4.1 Chinese morphology 
Chinese words are typically formed by four morpho-
logical processes: affixation, compounding, idiomi-
zation, and reduplication, as shown in Table 4. 
In affixation, a bound morpheme is added to other 
morphemes, forming a larger unit. Chinese has a 
small number of prefixes and infixes7 and numerous 
suffixes (Chao 1968, Li and Thompson 1981). Chi-
nese prefixes include items such as gui (?noble?) in 
guixing (?your name?), bu (?not?) in budaode (?im-
moral?), and  lao (?senior?) in laohu (?tiger?) and 
laoshu (?mouse?). There are a number of Chinese 
suffixes, including zhe (?marks a person who is an 
agent of an action?) in zuozhe (?author?), shi (?mas-
ter?) in laoshi (?teacher?), ran (-ly) in huran (?sud-
denly?), and xin (-ity or ?ness) in kenengxin
(?possibility?). 
Compound words are composed of multiple stem 
morphemes. Chao (1968) describes a few of the dif-
ferent compounding rules in Mandarin, such as coor-
dinate compound, subject predicate compound, noun 
noun compound, adj noun compound and so on. Two 
examples of coordinate compounds are anpai
ARRANGE-ARRANGE (?to arrange, arrangement?) 
and xuexi STUDY-STUDY (?to study?). 
Table 4 Chinese morphological rules and examples 
 Examples 
Prefix lao (?senior?) in laohu ( ?tiger?)  
Suffix shi (?master?) in laoshi (?teacher?) 
Compounding xuexi  (?to study?, ?study?) 
Idiomization wanshiruyi (?everything is fine?) 
Reduplication changchang (?taste a bit?) 
Compounding is extremely common in both Chinese 
and German. The phrase ?income tax? is treated as 
an NP in English, but it is a word in German, Ein-
kommensteuer, and in Chinese, suodesui. We suggest 
that it is this rich use of compounding that causes the 
wide variety of unknown common nouns and verbs 
in Chinese and German. However, there are still dif-
ferences in their compound rules. German com-
pounds can compose with a large number of elements, 
but Chinese compounds normally consist of two 
bases. Most German compounds are nouns, but Chi-
nese has both noun and verb compounds.  
Two final types of Chinese morphological processes 
that we will not focus on are idiomization (in which a 
whole phrase such as wanshiruyi (?everything is 
fine?) functions as a word, and reduplication, in 
which a morpheme or word is repeated to form a new 
word such as the formation of changchang (?taste a 
                                                          
7 Chinese only has two infixes, which are de and bu (not). We do 
not discuss infixes in the paper, because they are handled phrasally 
rather than lexically in CTB.

bit?), from chang ?taste?. (Chao 1968, Li and 
Thompson 1981).  
4.2 Difficulty
The morphological characteristics of Chinese create 
various problems for part-of-speech tagging. First, 
Chinese suffixes are short and sparse. Because of the 
prevalence of compounding and the fact that the mor-
phemes are short (1 character long), there are more 
than 4000 affixes. This means that the identity of an 
affix is often a sparsely-seen feature for predicting 
POS. Second, Chinese affixes are poor cues to POS 
because they are ambiguous; for example 63% of 
Chinese suffix tokens in CTB have more than one 
possible tag, while only 31% of English suffix tokens 
in WSJ have more than one tag. Most English suf-
fixes are derivational and inflectional suffixes like   -
able, -s and -ed. Such functional suffixes are used to 
indicate word classes or syntactic function. Chinese, 
however, has no inflectional suffixes and only a few 
derivational suffixes and so suffixes may not be as 
good a cue for word classes. Finally, since Chinese 
has no derivational morpheme for nominalization, it 
is difficult to distinguish a nominalization and a verb.  
These points suggest that morpheme identity, which 
is the major feature used in previous research on un-
known words in English and German, will be insuffi-
cient in Chinese. This suggests the need for more 
sophisticated features, which we will introduce be-
low.  
5 Experiments
We evaluate our tagger under several experimental 
conditions: after showing the effects of data cleanup 
we show basic results based on features found to be 
useful by previous research. Next, we introduce addi-
tional morphology-based unknown word features, 
and finally, we experiment with training data of vari-
able sizes and different language varieties. 
5.1 Data sets 
To study the significance of training on different 
varieties of data, we created three training sets: train-
ing set I contains data only from one variety, training 
set II contains data from 3 varieties, and is similar in 
total size to training set I. Training set III also con-
tains data from 3 varieties and has twice much data 
as training set I. To facilitate comparison of perform-
ance both between and within Mandarin varieties, 
both the devset and the test set we created are com-
posed of three varieties of data. The XH test data we 
selected was identical to the test set used in previous 
parsing research by Bikel and Chiang (2000). For the 
remaining data, we included HKSAR and SM data 
that is similar in size to the XH test set. Table 5 de-
tails characteristics of the data sets.

5.2 The model 
Our model builds on research into loglinear models 
by Ng and Low (2004), Toutanova et al, (2003) and 
Ratnaparkhi (1996). The first research uses inde-
pendent maximum entropy classifiers, with a se-
quence model imposing categorical valid tag 
sequence constraints. The latter two use maximum 
entropy Markov models (MEMM) (McCallum et al, 
2000), that use log-linear  models to obtain the prob-
abilities of a state transition given an observation and 
the previous state, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a).  
Figure 1 Graphical representation of transition probability 
calculation used in maximum entropy Markov models. (a) 
The previous state and the current word are used to calcu-
late the transition probabilities for the next state transition. 
(b) Same as (a), but when model is run right to left. 
Using left-to-right transition probabilities, as in Fig-
ure 1 (a), the equation for the MEMM can be for-
mally stated as the following, where by di represents 
the set of features the transition probabilities are con-
ditioned on:

Maximum entropy is used to calculate the probability 
P(ti| di) using the equation below. Here, fj(ti,di) repre-
sents a feature derived from the available contextual 
information (e.g. current word, previous tag, next 
word, etc.)

We also used Gaussian prior to prevent overfitting. 
This technique allows us to utilize a large number of 
lexical and MEMM state sequence based features 
and also provides an intuitive framework for the use 
of morphological features generated from unknown 
word models. 
5.3 Data cleanup 
Before investigating the effect of our new features, 
we show the effects of data cleanup. Table 6 illus-
trates the .46 (absolute) performance gain obtained 
by cleaning character encoding errors and normaliz-
ing half width to full width.  
We also clustered punctuation symbols, since train-
ing set I has too many (36) variety of punctuations, 
compared to 9 in WSJ. We clustered punctuations, 
for example grouping ??? and ??? together. This 
mapping renders an overall improvement of .08%. 
All models in the following sections are then trained 
on font-normalized and punctuation clustered data. 
Table 6 Improvement of tagging accuracy after data 
cleanup. The features used by all of the models are the 
identity of the two previous words, the current word and 
the two following word. No features based on the sequence 
of tags were used.

5.4 Sequence features 
We examined several tag sequence features from 
both left and right side of the current word. We use 
the term lexical features to refer to features derived 
from the identity of a word, and tag sequence fea-
tures refer to features derived from the tags of sur-
rounding words.  
These features have been shown to be useful in pre-
vious research on English (Toutanova et al 2003, 
Brants 2000, Thede and Harper 1999) 
The models9 in Table 7 list the different tag sequence 
features used; they also use the same lexical features 
from the model 2Rw+2Lw shown in Table 6. The ta-
ble shows that Model Lt+LLt conditioning on the 
previous tag and the conjunction of the two previous 
                                                          
8 We abbreviate accuracy as ?A?. 
9 Except where otherwise stated, during training, a count cutoff of 
3 is applied to all features found in the training set. If a feature 
occurs fewer than 3 times, it is simply removed from the training 
data. All models are trained on training set I and evaluated on the 
devset.  
tags yields 88.27%. As such, using the sequence fea-
tures<ti-1, ti-1ti-2> achieves the current best result.  
So far, there are no features specifically tailored to-
ward unknown words in the model.

5.5 Unknown word model 
Starting with Model Lt+LLt from the last section, we 
introduce 8 features to improve the performance of 
the tagger on unknown words. In the sections that 
follow, the model using affixation in conjunction 
with the basic lexical features described above is 
considered to be our baseline. 
We considered words that occur less than 7 times in 
the training set I as rare; if Wi is rare, an unknown 
word feature is used in place of a feature based on 
the actual word?s identity. During evaluation, un-
known word features are used for all words that oc-
curred zero to 7 times in the training data. In addition, 
when tagging such rare and unknown words, we re-
strict the set of possible tags to just those tags that 
were associated with one or more rare words in the 
training data. 
5.5.1 Affixation
Our affixation feature is motivated by similar fea-
tures seen in inflectional language models. (Ng and 
Low 2004, Toutanova et al 2003, Brants 2000, Rat-
naparkhi 1996, Samuelsson 1993). Since Chinese 
also has affixation, it is reasonable to incorporate this 
feature into our model. For this feature, we use char-
acter n-gram prefixes and suffixes for n up to 4.10 An 
example is:  
??? INFORMATION-BAG "folder"  
Wi=??? ?a folder? 
FAFFIX={(prefix1,?), (prefix2,??), (prefix3,??
?), (suffix1,?), (suffix2,??), (suffix3,???)} 
5.5.2 CTBMorph (CTBM) 
While affix information can be very informative, we 
showed earlier that affixes in Chinese are sparse, 
short, and ambiguous.  Thus as our first new feature 
we used a POS-vector of the set of tags a given affix 
could have. We used the training set to build a mor-
pheme/POS dictionary with the possible tags for each 
                                                          
10 Despite the short average word length, we found that affixes up 
to size 4 worked better than affixes only up to size 2, perhaps 
mainly because they help with long proper nouns and temporal 
expressions. 
36
morpheme. Thus for each prefix and suffix that oc-
curs with each CTB tag in the training set I, we asso-
ciate a set of binary features corresponding to each 
CTB tag. In the example below the prefix ? oc-
curred in both NN and VV words, but not AD or AS. 
Prefix1=?, suffix1=?
FCTBM-pre= {(AD,0),(AS,0),?(NN,1),?(VV,1)} 
FCTBM-suf= {(AD,0),(AS,0),?(NN,1),?(VV,0)} 
This model smoothes affix identity and the quantity 
of active CTBMorph features for a given affix ex-
presses the degree of ambiguity associated with that 
affix.

        else f.appendPair(t, 0)  
5.5.3 ASBC
One way to deal with robustness is to add more var-
ied training data.  For example the Academic Sinica 
Balanced Corpus11 contains POS-tagged data from a 
different variety (Taiwanese Mandarin). But the tags 
in this corpus are not easily converted to the CTB 
tags. This problem of labeled data from very differ-
ent tagsets can happen more generally. We introduce 
two alternative methods for making use of such a 
corpus.
5.5.3.1 ASBCMorph (ASBCM) 
The ASBCMorph feature set is generated in an iden-
tical manner to the CTBMorph feature set, except 
that rather than generating the morpheme table using 
CTB, another corpus is used. The morpheme table is 
generated from the Academic Sinica Balanced Cor-
pus, ASBC (Huang and Chen 1995), a 5 M word 
balanced corpus written in Taiwanese Mandarin. As 
the CTB annotation guide12 states, the mapping be-
tween the tag sets used in the two corpora is non-
trivial. As such, the ASBC data can not be directly 
used to augment the training set. However, using our 
ASBCMorph feature, we are still able to derive some 
benefit out of such an alternative corpus.  
5.5.3.2 ASBCWord (ASBCW) 
The ASBCWord feature is identical to the 
ASBCMorph feature, except that instead of using a 
table of tags that occur with each affix, we use a table 
of tags that a word occurs with in the ASBC data. 
                                                          
11 The ASBC was originally encoded in traditional Big5 character, 
and we converted it to simplified GB. 
12 http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~chinese/posguide.3rd.ch.pdf 
Thus, a rare word in the CTB training/test set is 
augmented with features that correspond to all of the 
tags that the given word occurred with in the ASBC 
corpus, i.e. in this case, the pos tag of the identical 
word in ASBC, ???.
Wi=???
FASBCWord={(A,0),(Caa,0),(Cab,0)?(V_2,0)}  
5.5.4 Verb affix 
This feature set contains only two feature values, 
based on whether a list of verb affixes contains the 
prefix or suffix of an unknown word. We use the 
verb affix list created by the Chinese Knowledge 
Information Processing Group13 at Academia Sinica. 
It contains 735 frequent verb prefixes and 282 fre-
quent verb suffixes. For  example, 
Prefix1=?,  suffix1=?
Fverb={(verb prefix, 1), (verb suffix, 0)} 
5.5.5 Radicals
Radicals are the basic building blocks of Chinese 
characters. There are over 214 radicals, and all Chi-
nese characters contain one or more of them. Some-
times radicals reflect the meaning of a character. For 
example, the characters ?  (monkey), ?  (pig) ?
(kitty cat) all contain the radical ?  that roughly 
means ?something that is an animal?. For our radical 
based feature, we use the radical map from the Uni-
han database.14 The radicals associated with the char-
acters in the prefix and suffix of unknown words 
were incorporated into the model as features, for ex-
ample: 
Prefix1=?, suffix1=?
FRADICAL={(radical prefix, ?), (radical suffix,?)} 
5.5.6 Named Entity Morpheme (NEM) 
There is a convention that the suffix of a named en-
tity points out the essential meaning of the named 
entity. For example, the suffix bao (newspaper) ap-
pears in Chinese translation of ?WSJ?, huaerjierebao.
The suffix he (river) is used to identify rivers, for 
example in huanghe (yellow river).  
To take advantage of this fact, we made 3 tables of 
named entity characters from the Chinese English 
Named Entity Lists (CENEL) (Huang 2002). These 
lists consist of a table of Chinese first name charac-
ters, a table of Chinese last name characters, and a

table of named entity suffixes such as organization, 
place, and company names in CENEL. Our named 
entity feature set contains 3 features, each corre-
sponding to one of the three tables just described. To 
generate these features, first, we check if the prefix 
of an unknown is in the Chinese last name table. Sec-
ond, we check if the suffix is in the Chinese first 
name table. Third, we check if the suffix of an un-
known word is in the table of named entity suffixes. 
In Chinese last names are written in front of a first 
name, and the whole name is considered as a word, 
for example: 
Prefix1=?,  suffix1=?
FNEM={(last name, 0), (first name, 0), (NE suffix, 
1)}
5.5.7 Length of a word 
The length of a word can be a useful feature, because 
the majority of words in CTB have less than 3 char-
acters. Words that have more than 3 characters are 
normally proper nouns, numbers, and idioms. There-
fore, we incorporate this feature into the system. For 
example:  
Wi=???, Flength={(length , 3)} 
5.5.8 Evaluation
Table 8 shows our results using the standard maxi-
mum entropy forward feature selection algorithm; at 
each iteration we add the feature family that most 
significantly improves the log likelihood of the train-
ing data given the model. We seed the feature space 
search with the features in Model Lt+LLt. From this 
model, adding suffix information gives a 9.58% (ab-
solute) gain on unknown word tagging. Subsequently 
adding in prefix makes unknown word accuracy go 
up to 63.66%. Our first result is that Chinese affixes 
are indeed informative for unknown words.  On the 
right side of Table 8, we can see that this perform-
ance gain is derived from better tagging of common 
nouns, verbs, proper nouns, numbers and others. Be-
cause earlier work in many languages including Chi-
nese uses these simple prefix and suffix features 
(Brants 2000, Ng and Low 2004) we consider this 
performance (63.66% on unknown words) as our 
baseline. 
Adding in the feature set CTBM gives another 
12.47% (absolute) improvement on unknown words. 
With this feature, punctuation shows the largest tag-
ging improvement. The CTBM feature helps to iden-
tify punctuation since all other characters have been 
seen in different morpheme table made from the 
training set. That is, for a given word the lack of 
CTBM features cues that the word is a punctuation 
mark. Also, while this feature set generally helps all 
tagsets, it hurts a bit on nouns. 
Adding in the ASBC feature sets yields another 
1.23% and 1.48% (absolute) gains on unknown 
words. These two feature sets generally improve per-
formance on all tagsets. Including the verb affix fea-
ture helps with common nouns and proper nouns, but 
hurts the performance on verbs. Overall, it yields 
0.21% gain on unknown words. Finally, adding the 
radical feature helps the most on nouns, while subse-
quently adding in the name entity morphemes help to 
reduce the error on proper nouns by 2.50%. Finally, 
adding in feature length renders a 0.25% gain on 
unknown words.  Commutatively, applying the fea-
ture sets results in an overall accuracy of 91.97% and 
an unknown word accuracy of 79.86%. 
5.6   Experiments with the training sets of 
variable sizes and varieties 
In this section, we compare our best model with the 
baseline model using different corpora size and lan-
guage varieties in the training set. All the evaluations 
are reported on the test set, which has roughly equal 
amounts of data from XH, HKSAR, and SM. 
The left column of Table 9 shows that when we train 
a model only on a single language variety and test on 
a mixed variety data, our unknown word accuracy is 
79.50%, which is 18.48% (absolute) better than the 
baseline. The middle column shows when the train-
ing set is composed of different varieties and hence 
looks like the test set, performance of both the base-
line and our best model improves.

Best 91.34 79.50 93.00 81.62 93.74 86.33
The right column shows the effect of doubling the 
training set size, using mixed varieties. As expected, 
using more data benefits both models.  
These results show that having training data from 
different varieties is better than having data from one 
source. But crucially, our morphological-based fea-
tures improve the tagging performance on unknown 
words even when the training set includes some data 
that resembles the test set. 
How good are our best numbers, i.e. 93.7% on POS 
tagging in CTB 5.0? Unfortunately, there are no 
clean direct comparisons in the literature. The closest 
result in the literature is Xue et al (2002), who re-
train the Ratnaparkhi (1996) tagger and reach accu-
racies of 93% using CTB-I. However CTB-I contains 
only XH data and furthermore the data split is no 
longer known for this experiment (Xue p.c.) so a 
comparison is not informative. However, our per-
formance on tagging when trained on Training I and 
tested on just the XH part of the test set is 94.44%, 
which might be a more relevant comparison to Xue 
et al (2002).   
6 Conclusion
Previous research in part-of-speech tagging has re-
sulted in taggers that perform well when the training 
set and test set are both drawn from the same corpus. 
Unfortunately, for many potential real world applica-
tions, such an arrangement is just not possible.  
Our results show that using sophisticated morpho-
logical features can help solve this robustness prob-
lem. These features would presumably also be 
applicable to other languages and NLP tasks that 
could benefit from the use of morphological informa-
tion 
Besides these tagging results, our research provides 
valuable analytic results on understanding the nature 
of unknown words cross-linguistically. Our results 
that unknown words in Chinese are not proper nouns 
like in English, but rather common nouns and verbs, 
suggest a similarity to German. We suggest this is 
because both German and Chinese, despite their huge 
differences in genetic, area, and other typological 
characteristics, tend to form unknown words through 
a similar word formation rule, compounding.
