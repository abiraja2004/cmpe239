Abstract 
In spite of long controversy, effectiveness of 
phrasal indexing is not yet clear. 
Recently, correlation between query length and 
effect of phrasal indexing is reported. 
In this paper, terms extracted from the topic set 
of the NACSIS test collection 1are analyzed 
utilizing statistic tools in order to show 
distribution characteristics of single 
word/phrasal terms with regard to relevant/non- 
relevant documents. Phrasal terms are found to 
be very good discriminators in general but not 
all of them are effective as supplemental phrasal 
terms. A distinction of informative / neutral / 
destructive phrasal terms is introduced. Retrieval 
effectiveness is examined utilizing query weight 
ratio of these three categories of phrasal terms. 
Introduction 
Longer queries are not necessarily better than 
shorter queries in view of retrieval effectiveness, 
since longer queries may contain so-called noisy 
terms that hurt the performance. 
Given relevance judgements, we can say which 
terms are noisy and which are not with regard to 
a certain topic description and a test collection. 
We can confwm that a term is good to 
discriminate subject concepts if relevant 
documents contain such terms and non-relevant 
documents do not contain them and that a term 
is noisy if the situation is the opposite. 
The problem here is that not only noisy terms 
but also good terms can harm the performance in 
some cases where term weighting is not 
adequate or terms are redundant. 
One example of such cases is complex terms 
like supplemental phrases or overlap bigrams 
which violate term independence assumption. 
Phrasal terms are utilized either as replacement 
of single words or as supplemental units for 
single words, but according to our experience, 
phrasal terms as replacement of single words do 
not perform well. Supplemental phrasal terms 
works better in spite of the violation of term 
independence assumption. 
Recent studies uncovered the correlation 
between phrase effectiveness and query 
length(Fujita, 2000). 
In this paper, we will see the problem of 
effectiveness ofphrasal terms from two different 
viewpoints utilizing a large test collection for 
Japanese text retrieval and statistical tools. 
NACSIS test collection I(NTCIR, 1999), which 
consists of a collection of abstracts of scientific 
papers ( 330,000 records, 590MB in text ), two 
sets of topic description ( 30 topics for training 
and 53 topics for evaluation ) and relevance 
judgement, provides us of a good opportunity 
for this purpose. 
Topic description of NACSIS test collection 1 
contains four different fields, just like early 
versions of TREC topics, as follows: 
<title> fields consist of one ( typically simple ) 
noun phrase. 
<description> fields consist of one ( typically 
simple ) sentence. 
<narrative> fields consist of 3 to 12 sentences 
and contain detailed explanation of the topic, 
term definition, background knowledge, purpose 
of the search, preference in text types, criteria of 
relevance judgement and so on. 
<concepts> fields consist of lists of keywords 
corresponding to principal concepts in the 
information need. 
Combining these four fields, different length of 
query sets for the same topics are prepared.

ueries combining 4 fields 
1. Phrasal Indexing 
For the baseline run experiments, we utilized the 
engine of Coneeptbase S arch 1.2, a commercial 
based search engine adopting vector space 
model approach. 
1.1. Linguistic Phrases as Indexing Units 
for Japanese Text Retrieval 
For automatic indexing of Japanese written text, 
once word boundary is detected by 
morphological nalysis processing, word based 
approach normally adopted in English IR can be 
applied. Although computationally more 
expensive than in English, the accuracy of 
Japanese morphological nalysis is quite high 
and sufficient for IR purpose. 
Our approach consists of utilizing noun phrases 
extracted by linguistic processing as 
supplementary indexing terms in addition to 
single word terms contained in phrases. Phrases 
and constituent single word terms are U, eated in 
the same way, both as independent terms, where 
the frequency of each term is counted 
independently based on its occurrences. 
Linguistic phrases are normally contiguous kanji 
or katakana word sequences and internal phrase 
structures are ignored. 
1.2. Query Length and Effectiveness of 
Phrasal Indexing 
Among evaluation experiments of the NTCIR1 
workshop, correlation between query length and 
the effect of phrasal indexing is reported in 
(Fujita, 1999). 
NTCIR topic description consists of four fields 
namely <title>, <description>, <narrative> and 
<concepts> as shown in the previous chapter. 
The combination of these four fields makes 15 
different versions of queries for each topic. 
These 15 different versions of queries for 53 
topics are examined with phrasal terms and with 
only single word terms. 
Table 1 shows the performance with 15 versions 
of  queries, where we compared two types of 
indexing language in question i.e. single words 
vs. single words + supplemental phrases. 
Performance is indicated as non-interpolated 
average precision macro averaged for 53 topics. 
Since this experiment is designed to clarify the 
effect of different length of queries, the 
following settings are chosen: 
48 
1) no pseudo feedback procedure isprocessed, 
2) no down-weighting coefficient is applied for 
phrasal terms, 
3) no field specific importance coefficient is 
applied. 
Consequently, absolute performance is much 
worse than our best performing runs. 
Out .of 15 versions of query sets, 10 times 
phrasal indexing performs better than single 
word only indexing, and 5 times vice versa. This 
is exactly the situation described in literature 
that he effect of phrasal indexing is inconsistent 
and uncertain. 
We found out that there is clear correlation 
between the difference of average precision and 
number of terms contained in the query. 
Pearson's correlation coefficient between Avg. 
pree2 - Avg.precl and average number of terrns 
accounts for 0.57, while 0.52 between Avg. 
prec2 - Avg.precl and average number of 
phrases. Eliminating 8 query versions containing 
<concepts> field, correlation coefficients 
become 0.96 and 0.95 respectively. 
<concepts> fields containing keywords that are 
essentially noun phrases, tend to favor phrasal 
indexing otherwise when using only one of the 
fields, single word runs perform better. 
The situation is different when more than two 
fields are combined. Combining <title>, 
<description> and <narrative> fields, the 
supplemental phrasal run performs better than 
the single word run. 
We can see that the length of query, which is 
number of features in the scoring function, is 
important factor as well as quality of phrasal 
terms extracted from topic description, in order 
to evaluate phrasal indexing. 
Two aspects of characteristics of phrasal terms 
should be considered: 
1) Are the phrasal terms good discriminator f 
subject domain? 
2) Do the supplemental phrasal terms cause 
some undesirable influence to original word 
based queries? 
In the chapter 2, phrasal terms extracted from 
the topic set of the NACSIS test collection 1are 
examined from the viewpoints of their 
discriminative power. In the chapter 3, we will 
see another aspect of retrieval effectiveness.

2. NTCIR  Data  Analysis 
Greiff presented an analysis of TREC data 
plotting each query terms in view of 
distributions in the whole document collection 
and in relevant document sets(Greiff, 1998) and 
Pickens et al applied this analysis for statistical 
phrases(Pickens et al 2000)? 
Adopting their plotting approach, we will try to 
clarify distribution characteristics of  phrasal 
terms using mainly p(occlrel) and p(occ) which 
are computed as document frequencies of the 
term in relevant documents/the whole collection 
respectively divided by each number of 
documents. 
2.1. Occur rence  in Re levant  Documents  
and in Non- re levant  Documents  
Table 2 and Table 3 shows high document 
frequency terms extracted from the short query 
set of test topics. 
A short query refers to a query conslructed using 
only <description> field of topic description and 
a long query, all fields of  topic description. 
First, plotting of  p(occlnon-rel) as fimction of  
p(occ) is not interesting since approximately the 
relation p(occlnon-rel)-'-p(occ) is observed. 
This is not surprising because number of  
relevant documents are generally very small and 
p(occ\[non-rel) can be approximated by p(occ). 
From Table 2 and Table 3, we can imagine that 
the distribution characteristics of  phrasal terms 
are almost same as single words i.e. Zipfian 
distribution but document frequencies of  phrasal 
terms are much smaller than single words. 
It seems difficult to get clear intuition about 
term distribution characteristics from Figure 1, 
where p(occIrel) is plotted as fimction of p(occ). 
The same p(occ) value for some frequent erms 
found in plots indicates multiple occurrences of  
a term in different queries. 
As Greiff suggests, a different visualization is 
desirable for this graph.

Figure 2: Iog(p(occlrel)/p(occ)) as function of log(O(occ)) 
Left above: short query single words, Right above: short query phrases 
Left below: long query single words, Right below: long query phrases 
First p(occ) is replaced by 
log(O(occ))=log(p(occ)/1-p(occ)), since 
distribution of p(oec) is too skewed? 
In Figure 1, if the dot representing a term 
located higher than the graph of 
p(occ)=p(occlrel), the term can be a good 
discriminator and should contribute to retrieval 
performance given an adequate weighting 
scheme? On the other hands, the terms plotted 
lower than the graph of p(occ)---p(occlrel) are 
by no means useful for retrieval performance 
irrespective of weighting scheme. 
P(occirel) is replaced by log(p(occlrel)/p(occ)) in 
order to illustrate this borderline. In the case of 
zero probability for p(occlrel), -6 is assigned for 
log(p(occlrel)/p(oec)). 
This is equivalent to mutual information 
MI(occ;rel) in information theory as follows: 
lod'P(?CC I rel) , ( p(occ, rel) 
Finally, Figure 2 illustrates distribution 
characteristics of terms much better than Figure 
1. 
The dots plotted above the y=0 line represent 
useful terms with respect to the query and

relevance judgements. 
As this shows, single words and phrases are very 
similar distribution characteristics but document 
frequencies for phrases are much lower. Average 
of log(O(occ)) is -5.22 for single words while - 
8.64 for phrases in long queries. 
On the other hands, ratios of good terms, whose 
log(p(occlrel)/p(occ)) is larger than 0, are shown 
in Table 4. 
From this observation, we can see limited 
usefulness of phrasal terms with regards to 
relevance. The ratio of positive 
log(p(occlrel)/p(oce)) is lower than single words. 
This explains poor performance of pre- 
coordinated longer phrase based indexing that 
utilizes phrases as replacements of single words. 
Phrasal terms tend to have high value of 
log(p(occlrel)/p(oce)), but this does not 
necessarily mean effectiveness of phrasal terms. 
As Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate, the terms 
with high log(p(ocelrel)/p(occ)) value tend to 
have low log(O(oec)) that means extremely 
lower document frequency so that they are not 
so useful because of such lower frequency. 
2.2. Measures for Phrasal Term 
Effectiveness 
Table 4 and Table 5 seem to support 
supplemental phrasal indexing, because fairly 
high ratio of positive log(p(occlrel)/p(occ)) 
terms, and higher average value of 
log(p(oeclrel)/p(occ) ) are observed. But for short 
queries, supplementing phrasal terms did not 
show any positive effect as we have seen in 
Table 1. 
The following accounts are enumerated. 
1) Over-weighted phrasal terms may cause 
topic deviation from concepts represented by 
single words to concepts represented by 
phrasal terms. 
2) Supplemental phrasal terms are not 
always informative because their constituent 
single words are already indexed. 
If the phrasal term AB has a high MI(AB,rel) 
value in contrast with MI(A, rel) and MI(B,rel), 
this is the ease where phrasal terms are 
effective. 
Consider a supplemental phrasal term as 
informative if and only if its MI(occ,rel) is 
positive value and is higher than the sum of 
Ml(oce,rel) of constituent single words in view 
of the query and relevance judgements. A phrase 
"AB" is informative means that the occurrence 
of a phrase "AB" gives more information about 
relevance than occurrence of both single words 
"A" and "B". 
Table 6 shows the number and the ratio of 
informative phrasal terms. -1 is assigned for 
MI(occ,rel) when p(oeclrel) is 0. 
Giving different values (-3 and -6) for 
MI(occlrel) when p(occlrel)=0 did not change 
the results..

Table 7 : Examples of phrasal terms in three categories from NACSIS topic 31 
2.3. Three Categories of Phrasal Terms 
The following three categories of phrasal terms 
in view of possible contribution to retrieval 
effectiveness are proposed from the previous 
discussion. 
1) Informative phrasal terms : MI(oce,rel) > 
MI(occ of constituent single words ,reD. 
2) Neutral phrasal terms :
Z MI(occ of constituent single words ,rel) > 
MI(occ,rel) >= 0. 
3) Destructive phrasal terms : MI(occ,rel) < 0. 
For example, Table 7 shows phrasal terms 
extracted from all fields of topic 31 in NACSIS 
test collection 1,and classified accordingly. 
2.4. Weight Ratio of Phrasal Terms 
Retrieval status values are computed as a linear 
combination of each term weight, which is the 
product of the query weight and the document 
weight of the term. Using atn weighting in the 
SMART system for the same setting as the runs 
reported in Table 1, for each query term, the 
sums of weights of each query term are 
computed and for each query weight sum, ratio 
of informative phrasal terms and destructive 
phrasal terms are also computed. Macro- 
averaged ratios of informative phrasal terms and 
destructive phrasal terms are shown in Table 8. 
Still, short queries eem to contain better phrases 
in the ratio despite the fact that no consistent 
effectiveness for retrieval performance is 
observed. 
2.5. Correlation between phrasal term 
weight ratio and performance 
difference 
For each runs against he 53 test topic set both 
with short queries and long queries, correlation 
between query-by-query performance difference 
and query-by-query weight ratio of both 
informative and destructive phrasal term weight 
ratio are examined. Performance difference is 
measured by non-interpolated average precision 
and when the supplemental phrasal term run 
performs better a positive value is given as we 
have seen in Table 1. 
Table 9 shows the Pearson's correlation 
coefficient between performance difference and 
each weight ratio as well as and difference 
between weight ratios.

A positive correlation coefficient for informative 
phrasal terms and a negative correlation 
coefficient for destructive phrasal terms are 
observed as is expected, although the coefficient 
values are very small. 
Given a topic set, a document collection and 
relevance judgements, we are able to know 
which terms are good ( and possibly how good 
they are ) for retrieval performance but to 
explain slight performance difference between 
different indexing strategies seems to be much 
more difficult. 
Short queries contain relatively better phrasal 
terms even though absolute number of such 
terms is smaller than longer queries. But 
utilizing such phrasal terms does not always lead 
to performance improvement in macro-averaged 
precision-recall basis evaluation. 
3. Topic Deviation 
What we mean by topic deviation is a 
phenomenon that is similar to query drift caused 
by relevance feedback, but is incurred by some 
over-weighted supplemental phrasal terms. 
Terms representing some concepts in the topic 
are over-weighted consequently the search 
results are inclined to these concepts. 
We verified short queries where supplemental 
phrasal terms caused considerable degradation 
(difference in average precision is more than 
20%) and listed phrasal terms caused such 
degradation i  Table 10. 
As we can see, not only the neutral phrases in 
topics 50, 62 and 77, but also adding only 
informative phrases caused degradation as in 
topic 76. 
<description> field of topic 76 is translated as 
follows: 
"(I want to know about) methods for 
interference detection between polyhedral 
representations." 
This topic consists of two concepts namely 
"interference detection" and "polyhedral 
representation" and the supplemented phrasal 
tom "~i~ifls: ra~\]"(between polyhedral) is part of 
the second concept. 
Retrieval effectiveness depends on a subtle 
balance of weighting on each concept, especially 
in short queries, and redundant terms or over- 
weighted terms cause the scoring function to 
loose such balances. 
Conclusions 
Effects of phrasal indexing in view of different 
length of queries are observed in the 
experiments u ing NACSIS test collection 1, the 
first large scale test collection for Japanese 
information retrieval. 
Our observations and conclusions are as follows: 
1) Distribution characteristics of phrasal terms 
as well as single word terms are examined 
plotting each term's MI(oce,rel) as function of 
log(O(occ)). 
2) Distribution characteristics of phrasal terms 
are similar to single word terms but their 
frequencies are much smaller than single words. 
3) Generally phrasal terms are comparably good 
discriminators of relevant documents, if not 
superior, as single words are. 
4) In supplemental phrasal indexing, good 
discriminator terms are not always effective for 
retrieval performance but only some phrasal 
terms are informative and possibly effective. 
5) Informative, neutral and destructive phrasal 
terms are defined by means of MI(oce,rel). 
6) Correlation between performance difference 
and weight ratio of informative/destructive terms 
is examined and a very week correlation is 
observed.

Table 10: Phrasal terms in degraded topics by supplemental phrases 
7) Explaining effectiveness of each query term is 
not sufficient for explaining effectiveness of 
phrasal indexing. Even good discriminator terms 
may hurt the retrieval effectiveness. 
This research is by no means conclusive but a 
starting point of a longer project hat hopefully 
leads to a new weighting scheme to replace 
current empirical down-weighting approach for 
supplemental phrasal terms.
