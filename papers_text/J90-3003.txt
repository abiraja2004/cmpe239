We describe an experimental text-to-speech system that uses information about syntactic constituency, 
adjacency to a verb, and constituent length to determine prosodic phrasing for synthetic speech. A central 
goal of our work has been to characterize "discourse neutral" phrasing, i.e. sentence-level phrasing patterns 
that are independent of discourse semantics. Our account builds on Bachenko et al (1986), but differs in its 
treatment of clausal structure and predicate-argument relations. Results so far indicate that the current 
system performs well when measured against a corpus of judgments of prosodic phrasing. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In previous work (Bachenko et al 1986), we described an 
experimental text-to-speech system that determined pro- 
sodic phrasing for the Olive-Liberman synthesizer (Olive 
and Liberman 1985). The system generated phrase bound- 
aries using information derived from the syntactic struc- 
ture of a sentence. While we saw significant improvements 
in the resulting synthesized speech, we also observed prob- 
lems with the system. Often these stemmed from our 
assumptions that both clausal structure and predicate- 
argument relations were important in determining prosodic 
phrasing. This paper reconsiders those assumptions and 
describes an analysis of phrasing that we believe corrects 
many of the problems of the earlier version. Like the earlier 
version, it has been implemented in a text-to-speech system 
that uses a natural language parser and prosody rules to 
generate information about the location and relative 
strength of prosodic phrase boundaries. 
Our current analysis rests on two ideas. First, it is 
possible to describe a level of prosodic phrasing that is 
independent ofdiscourse semantics. Second, this discourse- 
neutral phrasing depends on a mix of syntactic and nonsyn- 
tactic factors; chiefly, syntactic onstituency, left-to-right 
word order, and constituent length. There is no necessary fit 
between syntactic structure and phrasing, since prosodic 
phrasing may ignore major syntactic boundaries in order to 
satisfy the constraints on phrase length. Our approach thus 
follows that of Grosjean et al (1979), namely, that phras- 
ing reflects " . . .  two (sometimes conflicting) demands on 
the speaker: the need to respect he linguistic structure of 
the sentence and the need to balance the length of the 
constituents in the output" (p. 75). 
Section 2 will outline our analysis, focusing on the rela- 
tionship between syntactic and prosodic structure. The 
analysis is developed within the framework of generative 
grammar, but we believe it is consistent with other ap- 
proaches to syntactic description. 1 Our main point will be 
that the syntax plays a necessary but not sufficient role in 
determining phrasing, its effects being filtered by separate 
conditions on prosodic well-formedness (e.g. length). Sec- 
tion 3 describes the implementation of our analysis in an 
experimental text-to-speech system, and Section 4 summa- 
rizes our main conclusions. Unless otherwise noted, the 
corpus we used as a source of observations on phrasing in 
human speech consisted of a taped professional dramatiza- 
tion of the Sherlock Holmes story The Speckled Band and 
a documentary about Mount Everest that includes both 
professional "prepared" narration and the spontaneous 
speech of interviews. The Holmes story involved two male 
speakers and one female speaker; the Everest documentary 
involved a male narrator and several male interviewees. 
Both of us independently transcribed the tapes according to 
our perceptions ofprosodic phrasing. Other examples come 
from transcriptions of speech that we recorded at Bell 
Laboratories. In the transcriptions, we both distinguished 
three types of prosodic event: a primary phrase boundary, a 
secondary phrase boundary, and the absence of a boundary. 
The most salient characteristic of the primary phrase bound- 
ary was a pause, while that of the secondary boundary 
involved a change in pitch. In comparing the two transcrip- 
tions, we discarded cases in which there was a discrepancy 
between the two markings, which left us with a corpus of 
approximately 500 sentences against which the prosodic 
phrasing rules were tested.

2 AN ANALYSIS OF PHRASING 
2.1 BACKGROUND: THE FACTORS THAT 
CONTRIBUTE TO PROSODIC PHRASING 
2.1.1 SYNTAX AND PROSODIC PHRASING 
What is the exact contribution of syntax to sound? There 
are well-known local syntactic phenomena that affect both 
phonetic segment quality and the stress pattern of the 
phrase. A difference in syntactic ategory affects phonetic 
quality in examples 1-3 below: 
1. a. They live in Canada. (live = verb) 
b. He ate live lobster. (live = adjective) 
2. a. Can you estimate the damage? (estimate = verb) 
b. Give us an estimate. (estimate = noun) 
3. a. As the water grew colder, their hands grew number. 
(number = adjective) 
b. Do you have his phone number? (number = noun) 
The type of object that a verb takes correlates with the 
pronunciation of the verb in 4 and 5: 
4. He resided in Holland. (reside pronounced \[rizaid\]) 
5. He resided the house with aluminum. (reside pro- 
nounced \[risaid\]) 
Syntactic ategory information also influences word pros- 
ody, as in 6 and 7, where knowledge of category member- 
ship is necessary to determine the correct stress pattern. 
6. a. Both content and style are important. 
(content = noun) 
b. They are content o remain here. 
(content = adjective) 
7. a. This ticket is invalid. (invalid = adjective) 
b. He is an invalid. (invalid = noun) 
Syntactic category may also affect phrasal stress. For 
example, the sequence power units has stress on units in the 
verb-noun sequence in 8, but it has stress on power in the 
noun-noun sequence in 9: 
8. If house current fails, power units from battery. 
9. The power units failed. 
Finally, syntactic gaps affect segment quality. For exam- 
ple, the vowel in the preposition to is normally weak, as in 
10. But if a gap like the one that is associated with the 
question word who in 11 follows the preposition, the vowel 
of to is strong. 
10 We spoke to John. (to pronounced/t~/) 
11. Who did you speak to? (to pronounced/tu/)  
When it comes to sentence-level prosody, especially phras- 
ing, it is often true, as we will see below, that a sequence of 
words dominated by the same syntactic node cohere more 
closely than a sequence of words dominated by two dif- 
ferent nodes. This observation has led some researchers, 
e.g., Cooper and Paccia-Cooper (1980), to claim a direct 
mapping between the syntactic phrase and the prosodic 
phra,;e. However, this claim is controversial because of the 
misa'dgnments that occur between the two levels of phras- 
ing. For example, in considering the connection between 
syntax and phrasing, the linguistic literature most often 
refers to examples of embedded sentences. Sentences like 
12, from Chomsky (1965), are frequently cited. (Square 
brackets mark off the NP constituents hat contain embed- 
ded sentences.) 
12. This is \[uP the cat that caught \[NP the rat that stole \[NP 
the cheese\]\]\] 
In such cases, the syntactic onstituency indicated by brack- 
eting is not in alignment with the prosodic phrasing. In- 
stead, 12 has the prosodic phrasing in 13a. The phrasing in 
13b, which most closely matches constituency, is strange at 
best. (In these and other examples, the most prominent 
prosodic boundaries are marked by vertical bars.) 
13. a. This is the cat II that caught he rat 1\[ that stole the 
cheese, 
b. ??This is II the cat that caught II the rat that stole \[\[ 
the cheese. 
To account for such mismatches, "readjustment rules" that 
change constituent structure by adjoining each embedded 
sente, nce to the node dominating it have been posited. The 
result is a flattened structure that more accurately reflects 
the prosodic phrasing. In Chomsky and Halle (1968), this 
flattening process is not part of the grammar. Rather, it is 
viewed as " . . .  a performance factor, related to the diffi- 
culty of producing right branching structures such as \[ 12\]" 
(p. 372). Thus phrasing, in their approach, is only indi- 
rectly related to syntax, since readjustment is done by 
special rules outside the grammar proper. 
Langendoen (1975) proposes readjustment rules similar 
to those of Chomsky and Halle, but he claims that the 
readjustment of structure is part of the grammar, not part 
of the performance model. He thus makes explicit what is 
often a tacit assumption i  both the linguistic and psycho- 
linguistic literature2--that there is a direct connection 
between syntactic onstituency and prosodic phrasing, with 
apparent misalignments readjusted before syntax inter- 
face,; with prosodic phonology. 
Langendoen's proposal works well for sentences such as 
12 because it predicts that important prosodic phrase bound- 
aries will coincide with sentence boundaries. But this does 
not always fit the prosodic facts--sentences that lack overt 
complementizers or relative pronouns often resist he inser- 
tion of a break to set them off. For example, when applied 
to They believe California sales are still off  75 percent, 
readjustment rules cause the embedded sentence to be set 
off prosodically, as in 14a. This seems quite unnatural 
compared with 14b (an observed example), where a bound- 
ary has been inserted not before the sentence, but after the 
embedded subject. 
156 Compur, ational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
14 a. ??They believe \]\[ California sales are still off 75%. 
b. They believe California sales I\[ are still off 75%. 
Similarly, flattening the relative clause it saw in It was 
ready to bite the first person it saw has the questionable 
effect of inserting a prosodic phrase boundary before the 
relative clause, as in 15a. But in our data, this sentence 
actually has the phrasing in 15b, where the relative clause 
is not set off. (The relative clause in these examples is 
italicized.) 
15. a. ??It was ready to bite the first person I\] it saw. 
b. It was ready to bite \[I the first person it saw. 
Moreover, there are certain distinctions among clause types, 
for example the difference between restrictive and apposi- 
tive relatives, that are captured only by the presence or 
absence of a separate prosodic phrase for the clause. How- 
ever, Langendoen's claim that embedded clauses are flat- 
tened would nullify this difference. The flattening and 
consequent setting off of restrictive relatives would render 
sentences such as 16a unintelligible because the associated 
appositive reading forces a contradiction between who 
came from Plymouth and who came from Falmouth. We 
believe the only intelligible version of this sentence is 16b, 
where there has been no readjustment of the come from 
clauses. 
16. a. ??The pilgrims \]\[ who came from Plymouth 1\] were a 
lusty bunch 1\] while the pilgrims \[\] who came from 
Falmouth II were not. 
b. The pilgrims who came from Plymouth 1\] were a 
lusty bunch I\[ while the pilgrims who came from Fal- 
mouth II were not. 
In sum, the contribution of syntax to sound is borne out 
by several phenomena. Even at the level of prosodic phras- 
ing, syntactic onstituents often cohere. Where misalign- 
ments between the syntactic and the prosodic phrasing 
occur, however, the notion of readjusting the syntax to fit 
the prosody is problematic and, we believe, compares unfa- 
vorably with an approach that views the semantic and 
phonological components a contributing to prosodic phrase 
boundary determination. 
2.1.2 SEMANTICS AND PROSODIC PHRASING 
The syntax/prosody misalignment may be viewed as result- 
ing in part from semantic onsiderations. Both predicate- 
argument relations and discourse factors have been exam- 
ined for their possible input to prosodic phrasing. 
Crystal (1969) claims that prosodic phrase boundaries 
will co-occur with grammatical functions uch as subject, 
predicate, modifier, and adjunct. Selkirk (1984) and Ne- 
spor and Vogel (1986) take a similar approach, but within 
a different heoretical framework. Previous versions of our 
work, as described in Bachenko et al (1986) also assume 
that phrasing is dependent on predicate-argument struc- 
ture. The problem here is that the phrasing in observed 
data often ignores the argument status of constituents. In
17a-f, for example, the phrasing makes no distinction 
between arguments and adjuncts. All of the sentences have 
the same X(VY) pattern even though Y is a complement in
the first case (thefirst serious attempt) and an adjunct in 
the others. (The complement in 17a and the adjuncts in 
17b-f are italicized.) 
17. a. A British expedition II launched the first serious 
attempt. 
b. A single bright light \[I shone out from the darkness. 
c. There were several little changes I\] carried out about 
that time. 
d. Were there any gypsies II camping in the planta- 
tion . . . .  
e . . . .  like the claws of a crab I\] thrown out on each side. 
f. Two years II have passed since then. 
The relation between discourse and prosodic phrasing 
has been examined in some detail by Bing (1985), who 
argues that each noun phrase in an utterance constitutes a 
separate prosodic phrase unless it is destressed because of 
reference to previous discourse. Bing also observes that 
constituents that refer to items newly introduced into a 
discourse tend to be longer. This may be the reason that 
word count and syllable count play a prominent role in 
prosodic phrasing (see Section 2.1.3.). To our knowledge, 
no work has explicitly explored the relation between the 
length of a constituent and its status in the discourse. 
Hirschberg and Litman (1987) and Litman and Hirsch- 
berg (1990) also examine the relation between discourse 
and prosodic phrasing. Their work succeeds in distinguish- 
ing the use of items like now, so, and well as discourse cues 
from their denotative l xical use on the basis of a complex 
combination of pitch accent ype and phrasing. 
The Hirschberg and Litman studies identify a specific 
discourse distinction that relates to phrasing. These studies 
are not intended to give a picture of the extent o which 
discourse relates to phrasing. On the other hand, Bing's 
work gives a broader picture of the relation between dis- 
course and phrasing, but it deals only with noun phrases. 
Thus both of these efforts leave open the question as to 
whether discourse features completely determine prosodic 
phrasing or are a complement to some more basic set of 
determinants, syntactic and/or phonological. In other words, 
when prosodic features that reflect facts of the discourse 
are removed, is there a residual, neutral phrasing? 
Our work on the prosodic phrase status of clause final 
prepositional phrases, which we discuss below, suggests the 
existence of a discourse-neutral phrasing that depends on 
syntactic onstituency mediated by string adjacency and 
length of a potential prosodic phrase. 3 Such phrasing pro- 
vides us with a typical phrasing pattern analogous to the 
typical phrasal stress patterns examined in Liberman and 
Prince (1977), which "are often overwhelmed by the chiar- 
oscuro of highlight and background in discourse, but retain 
the status of null-hypothesis patterns that emerge when 
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 157 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
there is no good reason to take some other option" (p. 251). 
This approach to prosodic phrase boundary determination 
brings us closer to a framework in which phonological, 
syntactic, and discourse features all contribute to prosodic 
phrasing. 
The possibility of a discourse-neutral prosodic phrasing 
is also of import o the prosodic quality of synthetic speech, 
since it allows us to "get by" without a complete description 
of the discourse features of a given text, many of which 
have yet to be characterized. Interestingly, in the data we 
examined we found only 14 percent of the phrases to be 
discourse-determined. 
The identification ofa preferred phrasing that is indepen- 
dent of discourse also aids us in identifying and characteriz- 
ing the discourse features that impinge on prosodic phras- 
ing. Several well-known discourse phenomena---coreference, 
contrast, and parallelism--affected the phrasing of the 
clause final prepositional phrases in our corpus. We are left 
with three or four unexplained cases that are suggestive of a 
discourse xplanation. 
2.1.3 PHONOLOGICAL LENGTH AND 
PROSODIC PHRASING 
The psycholinguistic studies of Martin (1970), Allen (1975), 
Hitlinger et al (1976), Grosjean et al (1979), Dommer- 
gues and Grosjean (1983), and Gee and Grosjean (1983), 
responding to the idea of readjusted syntax as the source of 
prosodic phrasing, show that grammatical structure, even 
if readjusted, is not in itself a reliable predictor of prosodic 
phrasing: mismatches between syntax and prosody occur 
often and systematically, and can be related to specific 
nonsyntactic factors such as length and word frequency. 
For example, although prosodic boundaries between sub- 
ject and verb do occur, there also exist prosodic patterns in 
which the boundary comes between the verb and object, 
i.e., the data reveal both X(VY) and (XV)Y  groupings. 
Grosjean et al (1979) claims that such mismatches are due 
for the most part to constituent length, which interacts with 
grammatical structure and, in some cases, overrides it. 
Thus syntactic and prosodic structure match when the 
major constituents of a sentence are roughly equal in 
length; for example, the main prosodic phrase break corre- 
sponds to the subject-predicate boundary in Waiters who 
remember well \]\[ serve orders correctly. Discrepancies in
length throw constituents off balance, and so prosodic 
phrasing will cross constituent boundaries in order to give 
the phrases similar lengths; this is the case in Chickens 
were eating I\[ the remaining green vegetables, where 
the subject-predicate boundary finds no prosodic 
correspondent. 4 
The most explicit version of this approach is the analysis 
presented in Gee and Grosjean (1983) (henceforth G&G). 
Drawing on the psycholinguistic studies mentioned above 
and on aspects of the grammar of prosody outlined in 
Selkirk (1984), G&G propose an algorithm for mapping 
syntactic structure onto a hierarchical representation of
phrasing; the rules they present accomplish this by integrat- 
ing syntactic information (e.g. constituent s ructure, left-to- 
right o:rdering) with information about constituent length. 
We have found that their rules, which are described in 
detail, provide a productive model for investigations of 
phrasing, and in what follows we shall frequently refer to 
their analysis. But, as we will show, G&G fall short of 
providing a comprehensive theory. Their rules are too 
limited and their syntax too underspecified to achieve 
moderate coverage for an unrestricted collection of sen- 
tences or to provide an adequate description for imple- 
mentation. 5 
2.2 CURRENT ANALYSIS 
Our goal has been to develop a theory of syntax/prosody 
relations that we could test in an experimental text-to- 
speech system. We approached the problem with the as- 
sumption that there is a level of prosodic phrase determina- 
tion that does not include discourse factors, and that aiming 
for this level would yield an appropriate phrasing for a 
sentence. Both the output of the system and our prelimi- 
nary findings, which show that discourse factors influence 
just a small part of the phrasings that follow a verb, 
indicate that this approach is feasible. 
The analysis that we arrived at takes G&G and, to some 
extent, Selkirk (1984) as its starting point. Hence we are 
assuming that there is no necessary match between syntac- 
tic structure and prosodic phrasing. Prosody rules refer to 
syntactic structure, but they are not obliged to preserve it; 
independent principles of prosodic well-formedness, in par- 
ticular length calculations, may create entirely different 
structures that appear at odds with the syntax. Here we 
shall describe the main features of our analysis and then go 
on to a description of the implementation. 
Our prosody rules are intended to account for two as- 
pect,; of phrasing: boundary location and boundary sa- 
lience. In 18, for example, the rules need to stipulate that a 
phrase boundary comes between the subject and predicate. 
18. The light among the trees \]1 was extinguished. 
But when there is more than one important phrase bound- 
ary ir~ a sentence, the rules will also specify a relative 
salience, or perceptibility, for each boundary. Thus in the 
observed sentence 19, where an adjunct has been prefixed 
to the sentence, the boundary between subject and predi- 
cate diminishes in deference to the stronger boundary 
between adjunct and core sentence. A single vertical bar 
marks the diminished boundary. 
19. About nine o'clock \]l the light among the trees I was 
extinguished. 
After deciding which boundaries will be diminished and 
which highlighted, the rules assign each boundary an acous- 
tic value that reflects its relative strength. Our current 
158 Comimtational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
system uses three values made available by the synthesizer. 
A pause and its concomitant prosodic effects mark the 
strongest boundaries, a pitch change signifies intermediate 
boundaries, and the weakest boundaries are assigned a 
phrase accent. 
Our work so far has focused solely on the issues of 
location and relative salience; the rules for associating the 
different boundaries with specific intonation contours and 
acoustic values are still quite rudimentary. Consequently 
our discussion will center on the location and salience rules, 
and we will mention the third rule class only in passing. 
2.2.1 BOUNDARY LOCATION RULES 
The location rules identify possible boundary sites by first 
deriving phonological words from the lexical items in a 
parse tree, and then grouping the phonological words into 
larger phonological phrases. The boundaries that separate 
phonological phrases are the candidates for prosodic phrase 
boundaries, ince the prosodic phrases of speech consist of 
one or more phonological phrases. 
Our rules for phonological word formation are adopted, 
for the most part, from G&G, Grosjean and Gee (1987), 
and the account of monosyllabic destressing in Selkirk 
(1984). Thus in our analysis, rules of phonological word 
formation apply to the non-null terminal nodes in a syntax 
tree. If the terminal is a content word, i.e. noun, verb, 
adjective, or adverb, then this terminal may have the status 
of a phonological word on its own. Otherwise the word 
combines with one or more orthographically distinct words 
to form a single phonological word that has no internal 
word or phrase boundaries. This is accomplished by adjoin- 
ing a word to its left or right neighbor depending on its 
lexical category and its position in the tree. Function words, 
e.g. auxiliary verbs, articles, prepositions, pronouns, and 
conjunctions, are all eligible for adjunction in certain syn- 
tactic contexts. Content words, copular verbs, demonstra- 
tives, quantifiers and elements in the complementizer node 
can serve as hosts for the adjoined material or stand alone. 
Figure 1 illustrates the effects of phonological word 
formation; the "+"  indicates that adjunction has taken 
place. 
Article adjunction, for example, attaches a, an, and the 
to a following word, so that a sudden and the trees in Figure 
1 each becomes a single phonological word in which the 
article acts as an unstressed syllable. The rule of preposi- 
tion adjunction, which has applied twice in Figure 1, at- 
taches a preposition to the material on its right only if it is 
the head of a PP, otherwise the preposition attaches left- 
ward. Thus in 20a, where the preposition is a syntactic 
head, in + the + dimly forms a single phonological word 
after article and preposition adjunction. The phrase bound- 
ary in this case will precede the preposition. But in 20b, 
where there is no PP (rather, the preposition is a sister of 
the verb in the syntax tree), f i l led + in is a phonological 
word. Hence the boundary will follow the preposition.

Rules of phonological phrase formation now build the 
next level of prosodic constituents. 7 Each phonological 
phrase consists of a syntactic head and the material that 
intervenes between it and a preceding head (usually, the 
pre-head modifiers, e.g. pre-nominal adjectives, pre-verbal 
adverbs). Following Selkirk (1984), we have limited the 
eligible head categories to noun, verb, adjective, and adverb 
(although adjectives and adverbs do not count if they 
directly precede and modify another head). Examples 21 a-b 
illustrate the results of phonological phrase formation. In 
each case, the phonological phrase is created by a left-to- 
right process that collects material up to and including the 
head of a syntactic onstituent. Every phonological phrase 
boundary thus marks a syntactic head as well as the site of 
a possible prosodic boundary in speech. (The sequences 
with + are words formed by adjunction; I stands for a 
phonological phrase boundary.)

Which boundaries become the prominent ones is deter- 
mined by the salience rules described below. 
The elements of phonological phrases cohere strongly in 
speech--they cannot be separated into smaller phrases 
without a dramatic effect on the semantic ontent of the 
sentence. In 22a, for instance, the italicized phrase must be 
treated as a minimal element with respect o phrasing; the 
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 159 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
phrasing of 22b, where an important break comes before 
the syntactic head, is rare in our data. 
22. a. I shall never forget I that April morning. 
b. ??I shall never forget hat I April morning. 
Example 23a, with a phonological phrase boundary before 
the preposition of  follows the pattern that is found in 
nearly all of our data. The observed pattern in 23b, where 
the boundary follows the of  creates a noticeably theatrical 
effect with emphatic stress on strange. 
23. a. He's a collector I of  strange animals. 
b. He's a collector of I strange animals. 
2.2.2 BOUNDARY SALIENCE RULES 
The rules for salience apply to a combination of phonologi- 
cal phrases and syntactic constituents. Their input is a 
structure like that in Figure 2, where syntactic onstituents 
may contain one or more phonological phrases. The NP in 
Figure 2 consists of a single phonological phrase, and the 
top-level PP contains two. The absence of VP in this figure 
will be explained below. 
When they apply, the salience rules merge phonological 
phrases to create larger prosodic phrases, which are also 
merged into a final phrase hierarchy. Boundaries between 
the phrases are thus diminished or emphasized, finally 
giving the impression of a balanced, rhythmic pattern

whose components appear to be equal in length. The sa- 
lience rules apply on the basis of (i) adjacency to a verb, (ii) 
length, and (iii) constituent type. 
All three factors interact in the initial balancing of 
material around a verb. In this process, the verb groups to 
the left to form a (XV)Y  pattern or it groups to the right to 
produce a X(VY)  pattern. Our analysis generally follows 
G&G, who propose the following rule, where, in their 
formulation, X is a prosodic onstituent or null, Visa verb, 
Yis a nonsentential complement, and C refers to phonolog- 
ical word count. 
24. Verb Balancing Rule 
in \ [x  v Y\] 
i:f c(x )  + c (v )  < c ( r )  
~:hen \ [ (XV)Y\]  
otherwise \[X( VY)  \] 
The rule works through a sentence from left to right. It says 
that if combining the verb with the constituent to its left 
yields a word count less than that of the complement, the 
verb fi~rms a prosodic phrase with its left neighbor. Conse- 
quently, the phrase boundary following the verb is strength- 
ened. For all other cases, the verb groups to the right so that 
the boundary preceding the verb becomes reinforced (G&G 
442). In 24, X and Y contain prosodic onstituents, either 
phonological phrases or prosodic phrases formed by other 
salience rules (e.g. the constituent rules that build NP and 
PP into separate prosodic phrases; see G &G, p. 441). Word 
count (C) is determined solely by the number of phonologi- 
cal words. 8
Example 25a gives the phonological phrasing (indicated 
by I) for This little incident gives a new zest to our 
investigation. Applied to this string, the verb rule will 
group the verb to the right and derive the X(VY)  pattern 
since This little incident plus gives adds up to four words, 
while a new zest is only two words; the to-phrase is not 
adjacent o the verb and so is not considered by the rule. 
The final phrasing is given in 25b, where the verb rule 
accounts for the break after the subject, and length rules 
that are discussed below account for the second boundary. 
25. a. This little incident I gives I a + new zest I to + our 
+ investigation. 
b. This little incident \]\[ gives a + new zest I to + our + 
investigation. 
Similarly in 26, Holmes' eyes traveled adds up to three, but 
the post-verb conjoined phrase round and round only counts 
for two. Hence the verb groups to the right. 
26. Holmes' eyes 1\] traveled round and + round. 
The sentences in 27 follow the (XV)Yoption. In 27, as +

Chickens plus were + eating also add up to two words, the

In their formulation of the verb rule, G&G impose two 
conditions on its application. First, the rule may examine 
only arguments of the verb, i.e., complements are candi- 
dates for Yin 24, but modifiers and adjuncts are not. Hence 
the rule must have access to VP constituency since verb 
complements, in the generative grammar framework as- 
sumed by G&G, are represented assisters of V in VP, while 
modifiers and adjuncts are outside of the VP. Second, the 
rule cannot cross S boundaries--embedded clauses form 
separate prosodic units in G&G's  analysis. 
Our studies indicate that these conditions are too strong: 
balancing around a verb often crosses both VP and S 
boundaries in our taped data. For example, in 28a-b, where 
the verb and its complement occur in a single prosodic 
phrase, the phrasing may appear to be influenced by the 
presence of a VP (the complement is italicized.). 
28. a. A + British expedition II launched the + first 
serious attempt. 
b. The + 48 channel module II can + have only two 
di-groups. 
Yet the verb also forms a single prosodic phrase with 
sentence adjuncts. This is the case in 29a-c, where the verb 
and adjunct are separated by an important boundary in the 
syntax (VP), but not in the prosody. In these sentences, 
while a secondary break may set off the adjunct, the main 
prosodic phrase boundary comes before a verb + adjunct 
sequence (the adjunct is italicized). 
29. a. Seven of + our + porters II were + killed in + the + 
fall  
b. a + crack \[\] opened in + the + snow. 
c. the + elements of + personal interest \[\[ must + be 
+ introduced at + all costs 
If the verb-balancing rule is restricted to subcategorized 
complements of the verb, as G&G assume, then the phras- 
ing in 29a-c has no explanation since, with the restriction, 
the main boundary in these sentences has to come between 
the verb and adjunct, a prediction that contradicts the 
observed pattern and sounds strange at best. Sentences 
such as those in 29a-c suggest that Yin the verb rule of 24 
should not be limited to material within VP but should 
include anything to the right of V. Hence we are assuming 
that the key to phrasing in 28a-b, 29a-c is the adjacency 
relationship between a verb and the constituent on its right, 
not verb phrase structure, or, equivalently, the complement 
versus noncomplement status of a constituent. In particu- 
lar, phrasing around the verb depends on the relative length 
of constitutents hat are adjacent o a verb and, as we will 
observe, the presence of specific verb-adjacent items (e.g. 
phrasal and). 
The phrasing of embedded sentences follows a similar 
course. Prominent phrase boundaries often co-occur with 
clause boundaries, e.g. Customers are asking retailers I\[ 
whether their watermelons come from California, but we 
believe that this is only apparently due to clausal constitu- 
ency. In our data, components of S can form a prosodic 
phrase with nearly any adjacent material, regardless of 
where the S boundary falls. For example, 30 a-c has the 
most prominent break before the matrix verb, not before 
the embedded S (which is italicized). The sentences of 31 
have the most prominent prosodic break within the embed- 
ded sentence. 
30. a. Even my + fiance 11 believes it's only my + imagina- 
tion. 
b. Did + Dr. Roylott 1\] continue to + practice? 
c. A + terrible change \[1 began to + come + over our 
+ stepfather. 
31. a. They + believe California sales \[\] are + still off 75 
percent. 
b. I've + heard that + the + crocuses II promise very 
well. 
c. Experience has + proved that + savages II are the + 
tyrants of  + the + female sex. 
d. I + seem to + see dimly 1\] what you're driving at. 
Here again it appears that G&G's  formulation of verb 
balancing, which prohibits the rule from crossing sentence 
boundaries, is too strict. Requiring the prosody rules to 
preserve the constituent status of embedded clauses pre- 
dicts that when the verb is followed by an embedded clause, 
as in 30a-c and 31a-d, balancing is superceded by rules 
that work on the internal structure of the embedded S; the 
result in most cases is a prominent prosodic boundary 
before the embedded clause. According to this approach, 
the sentence Did Dr. Roylott continue to practice? would 
have the odd phrasing Did Dr. Roylott continue \]\[ to 
practice? instead of the observed phrasing of 30b. 
The phrasing patterns of 30a-c and 31a-d are easy to 
explain if we assume that prosody rules ignore clausal 
constituency so that verb balancing applies across S bound- 
aries. Evidence from sentence adjuncts, e.g. the purposive 
in We went out to the Himalaya to cl imb.., and the 
relative clause in It was ready to bite II the first person It 
saw leads us to believe that prosody rules ignore these 
clausal constituents as well. Our analysis thus adopts the 
basic mechanism G&G propose with their verb rule, but 
without the conditions on verb complements and clausal 
constituency. While NP, PP, and AdjP constituents 
"count"in our prosody rules, VP and S constituents do not. 
Consequently, eligible material to the right of V in the verb 
rule 24 may be a complement, a modifier, an adjunct, or the 
initial constituent of an embedded sentence. The exact 
treatment of the left-adjacent constituent is still a topic for 
investigation, and there is currently no requirement that 
the material to the left of a verb be a subject. 
G&G intend the balancing rule to make the verb a 
prosodic enter by grouping constituents in such a way as to 
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 161 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
create, in most cases, two phrases of approximately equal 
length, with the verb as a left or right edge. During 
subsequent processing, this balancing effect is usually lost 
since neither length nor adjacency to a verb play any 
further role in G&G's analysis. After verb balancing, the 
remaining constituents are bundled from left to right into a 
left-branching binary tree like that in Figure 3. As we will 
discuss below, the higher the constituent is in the prosody 
tree, the more prominent will be the boundaries that set it 
off in speech. Hence, when constituents are bundled, as in 
Figure 3, material that comes at the end of a sentence will 
usually be set off by the largest breaks. This is what 
happens in 32a-b, where a strong boundary before the final 
(italicized) constituent seems desirable. 
32. a . . . .  walk away from your helper \[\[ approximately 50 
feet. 
b. I suddenly heard in the silence of the night II that 
same low whistle. 
But the application of bundling immediately after the 
verb rule often leads to problems. The salience of a bound- 
ary that occurs toward the end of a sentence tends to be 
overestimated when the final constituent is relatively short. 
When this happens, the final constituent may be set off 
unnaturally from the rest of the sentence. In 33a-c, for 
example, a strong boundary before the italicized constitu- 
ent is inappropriate. 9 
33. a. ??The speaker pronounced the names of the charac- 
ters II on the left. 
b. ??We locked our door for fear II of the cheetah. 
c. ??She had caught an early morning train \[I from 
London. 
We believe that the problems raised by final bundling 
can be avoided largely by extending the effects of length 
and verb adjacency beyond the verb balancing rule. In our 
analysis, this is accomplished by an adjacency rule and two

lengtlh rules that, in effect, sustain verb centering and 
determine the prosodic weight of constituents not adjacent 
to a verb. The adjacency rule in 34 applies after the 
balancing rule of 24 and groups the "unclaimed" verb- 
adjac, ent constituent with the phrase that was formed by 24 
(this will be either (VY) or (XV)). X in 34a and Yin 34b 
are prosodic onstituents. 
34. Verb Adjacency Rule 
a. \[ . . .  X (VY) .  . .\] --; \ [ . . . (X (VY) ) . . . \ ]  
b. \ [ . . . (XV)Y. . . \ ] - -~ \ [ . . . ( (XV)Y) . . .1  
where . . ,  is a phonological phrase or null 
and X may or may not be a subject. 
Case 34a says that if (VY)  is a prosodic onstituent, hen 
create a new prosodic onstituent composed of (VY)  and 
adjacent material to the left. Likewise 34b creates a new 
prosodic constituent by combining (XV) with adjacent 
material on the right. What results is a prosodic verb 
phase--a cluster of two prosodic phrases with the verb in 
the middle as a left or right edge. In 35a-b, for example, 
constituents abutting the verb have been worked into a 
single prosodic verb phrase by (i) the verb balancing rule, 
which groups the verb rightward with the complement 
(giving.. .  X(VY) . . . ) ,  and (ii) the adjacency rule in 34b, 
which generates a larger phrase containing the constituent 
on the left ( . . . .  (X(XY)). . .) .  The prosodic verb phrase is 
italicized; its internal boundary is marked by a single 
vertical bar. 
35. a. Everest I is an + enormous pyramid I\[ with + three 
wide faces and + three ridges. 
b. Mrs. Welles I wrote a + weekly sports column II for 
+ the + Christian Science Monitor. 
Constituents that are not adjacent o the verb form the 
periphery of a prosodic verb phrase. In 35a, the periphery 
consists of with three wide faces and and three ridges; in 
35b it consists of for the Christian Science Monitor. While 
our understanding of phrasing of the periphery of a sen- 
tence is far from satisfactory, we have been conducting a
study that so far suggests that, at least with respect o 
claw;e-final prepositional phrases, length of a peripheral 
constituent is an important determinant of its prosodic 
prominence. The phrases considered all occur to the right 
of tile verb with some material intervening between the 
verb and a prepositional phrase, PP. The intervening mate- 
rial varies from a full phrase to a single word that functions 
as a syntactic head to which the PP under consideration is a 
complement. In a test of 129 clause-final prepositional 
phrases, we noted the pattern shown in Figure 4. The clear 
bifurcation of the numbers in this test suggests that length 
of the PP is determining the degree to which final PPs are 
set off'. Many of the 18 apparent counterexamples to this 
claim also indicate that length establishes a discourse- 
neutral phrasing for sentence-final PPs that is contravened 
only by predictable syntactic and discourse factors. For 
example, the of-PP in the partitive construction of 36a is 
not in a separate prosodic phrase, even though it contains

where the of-PP is not a partitive.

chimneys \[\[ showed that part of + the + west wing.. .  
b. A + single bright light II shone + out from + the + 
darkness \]l of + the + west wing. 
Similarly, while the italicized PP in 37a follows the rule 
of being greater than one phonological word and therefore 
set off, a similar PP in 37b is not set off because the 
repetition of room causes this item to be destressed and 
consequently tomerge with the relevant PP. 
37. a. Holmes passed at + once \[\] into + the + room \[\[ in 
+ which Helen Stoner II was now sleeping. 
b. so + that I've + had to + move out + of + my +

In the implementation, the length rules extend these 
results to include post-verb peripheral constituents other 
than PPs; specifically, interjections and adverbials. Cur- 
rently, the length rules perform two operations on post-verb 
peripheral material, depending on word count. In one case, 
if a phrase, P1, consists of a single phonological word, it is 
adjoined to the most recently created phrase, PO (usually a 
prosodic verb phrase). The result is a new phrase, P2, 
whose boundary salience is equal to that of PO. This is 
illustrated in Figure 5, where i is a number representing 
salience (Section 3 shows how salience indices are derived). 
In the second case, a longer phrase, P1, will be bundled 
with its preceding material, PO, in order to form a new 
phrase, P2, whose salience is the sum of salience value for 
PO and the value of P1 (=word count + 1). In Figure 6, for 
example, the 'long' PP is set off by a relatively large index. 
Peripheral material at the beginning of a sentence is 
currently picked up by left-to-right bundling without re- 
gard to constituent type or length. The correct reatment of 
sentence-initial peripheral material remains a topic of inves- 
tigation. 
2.2.3 A PROSODIC LEFT CORNER CONSTRAINT 
In some cases, phrasing is influenced by the lexical content 
of a constituent. Phrasal and, i.e. the left corner of a NP, 
PP, AdjP, or AdvP conjunct, always starts a new phrase, as 
in Next to it II he placed a box of  matches I\[and a candle. 11 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
She had caught an early morning train from London 
Figure 5 Adjunction of Short Peripheral Phrase 
(i ---- boundary salience). 
In our analysis, this fact is captured by a global constraint 
on the prosody rules: no boundary location or salience rule 
may apply to a constituent whose left corner is a phrasal 
conjunct. Hence when phrasal and is adjacent to a verb, the 
prosodic left corner constraint will block the rules that form 
prosodic verb phrases. In 38 the verb rule is prevented from 
merging was extinguished with and all, as it would do if 
and were treated as any other function word. 
38. The light among the trees was extinguished and all was 
dark. 
Although the constraint should probably include other 
material, such as the subordinate conjunctions (e.g. be- 
cause, while, although), our current analysis acknowledges 
only phrasal and, or, and nor, requiring that they always 
introduce a separate phrase. In our implementation f the

prosody rules, we have extended the constraint to punctua- 
tion. For example, the comma in After Robert ate, his cat 
Freddy took a nap is first adjoined to the constituent on its 
right, to give After Robert ate,  + his cat Freddy took a 
nap, and then, like phrasal and, obligatorily starts a new 
phrase, preventing the prosody rules from merging ate and 
his cat. 
2.2.4 SUMMARY 
In this section, we have described an analysis of prosodic 
phrasing that incorporates two classes of rules. Boundary 
location rules form phonological words from the terminal 
elements of syntactic structure and build phonological 
phrases (the first tier of prosodic onstituency), using infor- 
mation about syntactic heads. Boundary salience rules 
assign a relative strength, or perceptibility, toeach phrase 
boundary according to syntactic labeling, length, and adja- 
cency; they ignore verb phrase and clausal constituency 
and predicate-argument relations. The primary salience 
rules are, in order, syntactic onstituency, which converts 
NP, PP, and AdjP constituents into prosodic phrases (see 
G&G, p. 441); verb balancing and verb adjacency, which 
derive prosodic verb phrases; length rules, which apply to 
the material on the right of a prosodic verb phrase; and final 
bundling, which collects phrases built up by the previous 
rules into a binary tree (see Figure 3). Location and 
salience rules are both subject o a left corner constraint on 
their application. In the following section, we discuss how 
the rules work in an experimental text-to-speech system. 
3 AN EXPERIMENTAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH 
SYSTEM 
We have built an experimental text-to-speech system that 
uses our analysis of prosody to generate phrase boundaries 
for the Olive-Liberman synthesizer (Olive and Liberman 
1985). Two concerns motivated our implementation. First, 
we hoped the system would provide us with a research tool 
for testing our ideas about syntax and phrasing against a 
large unrestricted collection of sentences. Second, we wished 
to investigate how well our approach would work for deter- 
mining prosodic phrasing in a text-to-speech synthesizer. 
Existing text-to-speech systems perform well on word pro- 
nunciation and short sentences, 12but when it comes to long 
sentences and paragraphs, ynthetic speech tends to be 
difficult to listen to and understand. Many investigators 
(e.g. Allen 1976; Elowitz et al 1976; Luce et al 1983; 
Cahn 1988) have suggested that the poor prosody of syn- 
thetic speech, in comparison with natural speech, is the 
primary factor leading to difficulties in the comprehension 
of fluent synthetic speech. And while researchers in text-to- 
speech synthesis have adopted a variety of approaches to 
prosodic phrase generation--from the simple punctuation- 
based rules and function word listings of existing commer- 
cial systems to the sophisticated prosodic heuristics de- 
scribed in Emorine and Martin (1988) and O'Shaughnessy 
(1989)---the generation ofappropriate prosodic phrasing in 
unres~tricted xt has remained a problem. 
As we will show, our results so far indicate that our 
experimental system, which assigns a discourse neutral 
prosoclic phrasing on the level of sentences, provides a 
significant improvement i  the quality of synthesized speech. 
We believe that one reason for the improvement has to do 
with the increased pitch range that our system uses. Text- 
to-speech systems that lack sentence-level phrasing must 
take a conservative approach to pitch settings in order to 
avoid misleading and inappropriate pitch modulations. Cor- 
rect phrase identification makes it possible to adopt an 
expanded pitch range that greatly enhances the naturalness 
of the final speech. In constructing the system, we focused 
on two core questions: (i) what kind of parser is needed for 
the p:rosody rules? and (ii) how should prosodic phrasing, 
i.e. boundary location and strength, be represented? 
3.1 PARSING FOR PROSODY 
The rules for discourse-neutral phrasing that we propose 
need examine only a subset of the syntactic information 
that most parsers provide. That is, the rules require access 
to lexical category, syntactic heads, NP/PP/AdjP/AdvP 
constituency, and left-to-right word order, but not to clausal 
constituency, predicate-argument r lations, or modifier at- 
tachrnent. We believe the rules must also recognize the 
trace of wh-movement (e.g. the trace that precedes the 
phrase break in The slope on which we were standing 
\[trace)' started to move), although other null terminals 
such as the trace of passivization are ignored. 13 At the 
outset of our project, we had available to us a moderate 
cove:rage deterministic parser--Fidditchla--that we
adapted to the syntactic requirements for prosodic phras- 
ing. This modified "speech parser" produces parse trees 
like that in Figure 7. The tree represents syntactic nforma- 
tion necessary for phrasing, but omits nodes (S, VP) and

branches that are unnecessary for prosodic phrase determi- 
nation. 
3.2 PROSODIC PHRASE REPRESENTATION 
Following G&G, we require that the prosody rules build a 
binary tree whose terminals are phonological words and 
whose node labels are indices that mark boundary salience. 
An alternative r presentation based on Liberman and Prince 
(1977) is presented in Selkirk (1984), which contends that 
prosody, including prosodic phrasing, is more properly 
represented asa grid instead of a tree. Although a grid may 
be more descriptively suitable for some aspects of prosody 
(for example, Sproat and Liberman (1987) use the grid 
representation for their implementation f stress assign- 
ment in compound nominals), we are not aware of any 
evidence for or against a grid representation f discourse- 
neutral phrasing. 
Figure 8 shows the phonological phrase tree that is built 
from the syntactic structure of Figure 7. The rules for 
building this tree apply from left to right, following the 
analysis we described in the preceding section. Figures 
9-11 show the prosodic phrase derivation. Numbered nodes 
refer to salience values, with higher numbers indicating 
greater salience. The index is assigned according to phono- 
logical word count, with one point added for the node itself. 
Figure 11 is the final prosodic phrase tree; in the notation 
we have been using, the phrasing represented by Figure 11 
is He told me I last night I\[ he was coming to London II for  
several days. 
Figure 9 shows the effect of two applications of verb 
balancing. Applying from left to right, the rule first looks at 
the phonological verb he + told + me. Since the material 
to the left of the verb is null, the rule must group this verb 
with the constituent on its right to form the node labeled ?. 
On its second application, the rule balances the prosodic 
phrase it has just formed against he single phonological

word to + London, and groups the verb rightward to form 
node ?. 
Verb adjacency is now triggered by the contiguity of ? 
and the verb he + was + coming. In Figure 10, this rule 
has formed the prosodic verb phrase ?. 
It remains to collect the "long" peripheral constituent 
fo r  + several days. In Figure 11, the length rule has built 
the final node of the tree; because the peripheral item 
consists of two phonological words, the value of the topnode 
is affected by the word count of the peripheral item. If the 
peripheral item had consisted of a single phonological 
word, the value of the top node would have been 8 instead of 
l l .  
Finally, each node index is converted into one of three 
acoustic values. High indices are marked as a minor phrase 
boundary; mid-range indices are signified with a downstep 
on the first phonological word following the boundary

ceive a phrase accent. The mapping onto three different 
values reflects a simple subjective choice. A more complete 
analysis would consider finer acoustic "tunings" for the 
indices. 
3.3 EVALUATING THE PHRASING SYSTEM 
In testing a prosodic phrase system, it is necessary to be 
clear about the goals of the work. At the level of basic 
inquiry, such a system should aim to correlate well with 
human speech production, assuming that we are able to 
abstract away from speaker variability. However, in work- 
ing under the assumption that discourse plays a role, 
however limited, in prosodic phrase determination, the 
comparison of synthetic to human phrasing becomes less 
meaningful since factors unknown to our system influence 
the placement of phrase boundaries. 
At the level of system building, a prosodic phrasing 
system should aim to make a text-to-speech system easier 
to understand. In general, adding phrasing to a text-to- 
speech system will enhance synthetic speech both by break- 
ing a run-on delivery into more easily processed chunks of 
speech and by allowing the pitch range to be increased, 
enhancing naturalness. The primary requirement for mak- 
ing synthetic speech easier to understand, however, is that 
the phrasing system should first do no harm, i.e., it should 
avoid misleading phrasings and phrasings like 38 that are 
difficult for a listener to process. 
38. ??This is 11 the cat that caught II the rat that stole \[I the 
cheese. 
To address the issue of avoiding undesirable phrasings, a 
system like ours must be run against a set of utterances of 
disparate l ngths and syntactic types to see where it breaks. 
To do this, we accumulated a set of syntactically varied test 
sentences, had them read by two speakers, marked the 
prosodic phrase boundaries as we had done with the Holmes 
and Everest data, and ran the sentences through our pro- 
sodic phrase system for comparison with the human speak- 
ers' phrasing. Phrasing in the speech of the two human 
speakers was almost identical; where the speakers failed to 
match, we depended on the speaker with the more detailed 
phrasing to obtain a single transcript for comparison. The 
sentences with the phrase markings produced by the system 
(S) and by the human speakers (H) are given in Appendix 
A. In addition, we used the sentences of Grosjean et al 
(1979) to test our system; these were the same sentences 
used by G&G. They were produced by six subjects peak- 
ing each sentence at five different speaking rates. We chose 
these data both because they form an established, though 
small, ,corpus and because their phrase markings, derived 
by oscillographic tracings of pause duration, provide a 
check: against he possibility of error in human judgments 
of pause location and salience. A comparison of these data 
with the output of our system is given in Appendix B. 
In comparing human and synthetic prosodic phrasing 
with an eye on synthetic phrasings that are either mislead- 
ing or unprocessable, errors in the assignment of primary 
phrase boundaries are the most egregious. In the data in 
Appendix A, the human speakers produced 31 intrasenten- 
tial primary phrase boundaries, of which our system 
matched 16 with its equivalent of a primary phrase bound- 
ary. 'Yhe other primary phrase boundaries in the human 
productions were matched in 9 cases with a secondary 
phra,;e boundary, and in 5 cases with a tertiary boundary. 
The system thus missed 1 primary boundary, the one after 
books in 17. In the absence of research on the relative 
significance of different boundary types, we are assuming 
that, with respect to the comprehensability and acceptabil- 
ity of ,synthetic speech, the difference between a primary 
and ,;econdary phrase boundary is minimal. On the other 
hand, the tertiary boundary produced by our system is 
almost imperceptible and cannot be considered equivalent 
to the primary boundary. The system thus matched, either 
exactly or approximately, 80% of the primary boundaries. 
In looking at the primary phrase boundaries that the 
system failed to duplicate, we want to be sure that we avoid 
difficult phrasings like that of 38 rather than match any 
particular phrasing exactly. In sentences 9, 12, 17, and 21, 
where our system produced a tertiary boundary at the 
location of the human speakers' primary phrase boundary, 
comprehensibility has not been diminished. The listener is 
misled only in sentence 17, where our system generated a 
boundary at a location different from that of the human 
speakers. In the system's phrasing of 17, the boundary 
before books corresponds to an interpretation f the utter- 
ance in which the books are written by her uncle, which, 
while it is a possible phrasing, presumes a specific discourse 
setting. 
A comparison of the secondary phrase boundaries in 
Appendix A shows similar correspondences. The human 
speakers produced 26 secondary phrase boundaries. The 
166 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
system matched 11 exactly and 12 with a primary or 
tertiary boundary. It thus failed to match 3 secondary 
boundaries, in sentences 9, 18, and 20, but only in sentence 
18 is the absence of the boundary misleading. 
To sum up, there are 2 boundaries out of the 57 produced 
by the human speakers whose absence in the system's 
output is truly problematic. Evaluation of the prosodic 
phrase system, however, must also consider cases of overgen- 
eration. It is significant here that in the 21 sentences of 
Appendix A, the system never generated a primary phrase 
boundary that did not correspond to a boundary in the 
human productions, although the system overgenerated 
secondary phrase boundaries at 7 locations. (We ignore the 
overgeneration f tertiary boundaries as perceptually insig- 
nificant.) Three of these secondary boundaries are problem- 
atic. Those in sentences 17 and 18 were discussed above as 
resulting from the misplacement of a boundary. The other 
unwanted secondary boundary occurs after was in sentence 
10 and results in an utterance that, like 38, is difficult to 
process. 
A comparison of our system's output with G&G's produc- 
tions, given in Appendix B, shows similar results. Of the 14 
primary phrase boundaries in G&G's sentences, the system 
matched 12 exactly. There were 2 primary boundaries, 
however, that the system missed completely. Both of these 
errors were due to the presence of a sentential subject. For 
sentence 6, no parse was produced, but otherwise the 
inability of our system to generate the correct result here 
stems from the fact that the system discards the syntactic 
sentence node in the derivation of the prosodic phrasing. 15 
With respect o overgeneration f phrase boundaries, the 
system overgenerated seriously only once, in sentence 4, 
where the subject is sentential. 
We find these results encouraging; with respect to match- 
ing, there were only four significant problems in the two 
corpora, and overgeneration f a primary boundary oc- 
curred only once. The suitability of our system for speech 
applications will depend on future tests to determine whether 
listeners prefer "prosodized speech" that is imperfect, i.e., 
speech that will have some phrasing errors, to the relatively 
"flat" speech of systems that lack our phrasing rules. The 
weak link in our current system is the parser: most prob- 
lems with phrasing arise from parsing errors; in particular, 
incorrect part of speech assignment, incorrect analysis of 
pre-head modifiers, and failure to recognize idiomatic or 
semi-idiomatic expressions. Problems with the prosody rules 
come mainly from phenomena that we have not adequately 
studied, e.g. the proper treatment of material on the left 
periphery of a prosodic verb phrase and the status of 
complements tonouns and adjectives. 
4 CONCLUSIONS 
We have discussed the notion of discourse neutral prosodic 
phrasing in English and presented an analysis that charac- 
terizes this phrasing in terms of constituency, adjacency, 
and length. In our analysis, the contribution of syntax to 
discourse-neutral phrasing consists of lexical categoriza- 
tion; NP, PP, and AdjP constituency; and syntactic head 
identification. Length is an independent phonological fac- 
tor. Because they refer to both syntactic and phonological 
information, phrasing rules are free to generate prosodic 
structures that may or may not resemble syntactic struc- 
tures. Hence, in speech, it is possible but not expected that 
phrase boundaries will co-occur with major syntactic bound- 
aries. 
Our results suggest that, in an implemented system, the 
parsing requirements for speech systems are quite different 
from those for systems providing information retrieval, 
machine translation, or text generation. In particular, there 
seems to be no need for a parser to identify VP and S 
constituents, nor to specify predicate-argument relations. 
The distribution of the phrasing of clause-final PPs given 
in Figure 4 may indicate the extent of the relation between 
the discourse neutral phrasing and the phrasing imposed by 
discourse. We assume that discourse phrasing may shift 
neutral boundaries in order to reflect, for example, empha- 
sis, contrast, parallelism, coreference, and the particular 
structure of the discourse. The exact connection between 
the level of phrasing we describe and discourse-dependent 
phrasing is a question for future research. We need to know 
what aspects of the discourse are relevant for phrasing, as 
well as how the discourse information and the phrasing 
specifications should be related. For example, it is not clear 
whether the discourse-neutral phrasing represents a set of 
pre-determined values that are reset when necessary by 
discourse features or whether this is a true default situation 
in which the discourse neutral phrasing is inserted when 
discourse phrasing is underspecified. Any contribution in 
this area will greatly enhance our understanding of the 
relation between the various components of the grammar--  
syntactic, semantic, and phonological.

NOTES 
Bachenko et al (1983) outlines the main features of the syntactic 
framework we assume. Any syntactic approach t at provides the 
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 169 
J. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English 
lexical and constituent information discussed in Section 2 should be 
sufficient for the phrasing analysis we presenl, but this idea remains 
to be explored. 
2. e.g. Cooper (1976), Cooper and Paccia-Cooper (1980), Klatt (1975), 
and Streeter (1978). Downing (1970), like Langendoen, explicitly 
assumes a direct connection between syntax and prosodic phrasing 
with "some aspects at least of surface structure . . .  determined 
exclusively by the necessity of providing input to the phonological 
rules that specify prosodic features" (p. 204). 
3. In characterizing this phrasing as discourse-neutral, weare assum- 
ing, contra Bing, that length is independent of discourse. 
4. Both examples are from Martin (1970). Bierwisch (1966) also 
includes length, in terms of stressed syllable count, as a factor in the 
prosodic phrasing of German auxiliary + verb strings. Length as a 
factor in prosodic phrasing is mentioned in Selkirk (1984) and 
Nespor and Vogel (1986), but without any systematic account of its 
effects. 
5. G&G's test corpus consists of 14 sentences that were originally used 
in Grosjean et al (1979). 
6. A more accurate account of adjunction, such as that in Selkirk 
(1984), would limit the list of adjoinable words to those that have 
both a strong and a weak form. For example, the word him in see 
him may be realized as the strong form \[him\], where the vowel 
carries stress, or it may take the weak unstressed form \[m.\]. This 
word is therefore a candidate for adjunction. In contrast, a preposi- 
tion such as among has no weak form and would be nonadjoinable. 
Results that we discuss below support his approach. Our current 
sy,;tem, however, relies solely on lexical category and tree structure 
to identify adjunction possibilities. 
7. These are essentially the phi phrases of G&G. 
8. Below, in the discussion of constituent length, we will claim that 
word count should actually be stressed syllable count. In the current 
system, however, length depends on phonological word count. 
9. Problems with final phrase boundaries are discussed in more detail 
in Bachenko et al (1986), where the analysis presented assumes the 
versi.on of final bundling proposed in G &G. We return to this type of 
example below. 
10. Prosodic events finer than the pause were marked but ignored for 
this study. A stress foot contains one stressed syllable and zero or 
more unstressed syllables. In our current implementation, length is 
measured by phonological word count, since stress foot information 
is not readily available to us. 
11. Cor~junctions of lexical items, e.g. some subtle and horrible crime, 
these windows and shutters, are rarely split into two phrases. 
12. Klatt (1987) presents a useful review of text-to-speech technology 
and performance. 
13. Fitzpatrick and Bachenko (1989) provide a more detailed iscussion 
of the differences between parsing for speech and parsing for text 
understanding. 
14. Hindle (1983); lexical ookup and category disambiguation are done 
by tlhe stochastic parser described in Church (1988). 
15. We have as yet no account of pre-verbal embedded sentences, 
though an analysis that does not involve an embedded S node is 
available (Koster, 1978).
