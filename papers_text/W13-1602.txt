Abstract
We present a bootstrapping algorithm to au-
tomatically learn hashtags that convey emo-
tion. Using the bootstrapping framework, we
learn lists of emotion hashtags from unlabeled
tweets. Our approach starts with a small num-
ber of seed hashtags for each emotion, which
we use to automatically label tweets as initial
training data. We then train emotion classi-
fiers and use them to identify and score candi-
date emotion hashtags. We select the hashtags
with the highest scores, use them to automat-
ically harvest new tweets from Twitter, and
repeat the bootstrapping process. We show
that the learned hashtag lists help to improve
emotion classification performance compared
to an N-gram classifier, obtaining 8% micro-
average and 9% macro-average improvements
in F-measure.
1 Introduction
The increasing popularity of social media has given
birth to new genres of text that have been the
focus of NLP research for applications such as
event discovery (Benson et al, 2011), election out-
come prediction (Tumasjan et al, 2011; Berming-
ham and Smeaton, 2011), user profile classification
(De Choudhury et al, 2012), conversation model-
ing (Ritter et al, 2010), consumer insight discovery
(Chamlertwat et al, 2012), etc. A hallmark of so-
cial media is that people tend to share their personal
feelings, often in publicly visible forums. As a re-
sult, social media has also been the focus of NLP
research on sentiment analysis (Kouloumpis et al,
2011), emotion classification and lexicon generation
(Mohammad, 2012), and sarcasm detection (Davi-
dov et al, 2010). Identifying emotion in social me-
dia text could be beneficial for many application ar-
eas, for example to help companies understand how
people feel about their products, to assist govern-
ments in recognizing growing anger or fear associ-
ated with an event, and to help media outlets under-
stand the public?s emotional response toward con-
troversial issues or international affairs.
Twitter, a micro-blogging platform, is particularly
well-known for its use by people who like to in-
stantly express thoughts within a limited length of
140 characters. These status updates, known as
tweets, are often emotional. Hashtags are a distinc-
tive characteristic of tweets, which are a community-
created convention for providing meta-information
about a tweet. Hashtags are created by adding the ?#?
symbol as a prefix to a word or a multi-word phrase
that consists of concatenated words without whites-
pace (e.g., #welovehashtags). People use hashtags
in many ways, for example to represent the topic of
a tweet (e.g., #graduation), to convey additional in-
formation (e.g., #mybirthdaytoday), or to express an
emotion (e.g., #pissedoff).
The usage of hashtags in tweets is common, as
reflected in the study of a sample of 0.6 million
tweets by Wang et al (2011) which found that
14.6% of tweets in their sample had at least one
hashtag. In tweets that express emotion, it is com-
mon to find hashtags representing the emotion felt
by the tweeter, such as ?the new iphone is a waste
of money! nothing new! #angry? denoting anger or
?buying a new sweater for my mom for her birthday!
#loveyoumom? denoting affection.

Identifying the emotion conveyed by a hashtag
has not yet been studied by the natural language pro-
cessing community. The goal of our research is to
automatically identify hashtags that express one of
five emotions: affection, anger/rage, fear/anxiety,
joy, or sadness/disappointment. The learned hash-
tags are then used to recognize tweets that express
one of these emotions. We use a bootstrapping ap-
proach that begins with 5 seed hashtags for each
emotion class and iteratively learns more hashtags
from unlabeled tweets. We show that the learned
hashtags can accurately identify tweets that convey
emotion and yield additional coverage beyond the
recall of an N-gram classifier.
The rest of the paper is divided into the following
sections. In Section 2, we present a brief overview
of previous research related to emotion classification
in social media and the use of hashtags. In Sec-
tion 3, we describe our bootstrapping approach for
learning lists of emotion hashtags. In Section 4 we
discuss the data collection process and our experi-
mental design. In Section 5, we present the results
of our experiments. Finally, we conclude by sum-
marizing our findings and presenting directions for
future work.
2 Related Work
Recognizing emotions in social media texts has
grown popular among researchers in recent years.
Roberts et al (2012) investigated feature sets to clas-
sify emotions in Twitter and presented an analysis
of different linguistic styles people use to express
emotions. The research of Kim et al (2012a) is fo-
cused on discovering emotion influencing patterns
to classify emotions in social network conversations.
Esmin et al (2012) presented a 3-level hierarchi-
cal emotion classification approach by differentiat-
ing between emotion vs. non-emotion text, positive
vs. negative emotion, and then classified different
emotions. Yang et al (2007b) investigated sentence
contexts to classify emotions in blogs at the doc-
ument level. Some researchers have also worked
on analyzing the correlation of emotions with topics
and trends. Kim et al (2012b) analyzed correlations
between topics and emotions in Twitter using topic
modeling. Gilbert and Karahalios (2010) analyzed
correlation of anxiety, worry and fear with down-
ward trends in the stock market. Bollen et al (2011)
modeled public mood and emotion by creating six-
dimensional mood vectors to correlate with popular
events that happened in the timeframe of the dataset.
On the other hand, researchers have recently
started to pay attention to the hashtags of tweets, but
mostly to use them to collect labeled data. Davi-
dov et al (2010) used #sarcasm to collect sarcastic
tweets from twitter. Choudhury et al (2012) used
hashtags of 172 mood words to collect training data
to find associations between mood and human af-
fective states, and trained classifiers with unigram
and bigram features to classify these states. Purver
and Battersby (2012) used emotion class name hash-
tags and emoticons as distant supervision in emotion
classification. Mohammad (2012) also used emotion
class names as hashtags to collect labeled data from
Twitter, and used these tweets to generate emotion
lexicons. Wang et al (2012) used a selection of emo-
tion hashtags as the means to acquire labeled data
from twitter, and found that a combination of uni-
grams, bigrams, sentiment/emotion-bearing words,
and parts-of-speech information to be the most ef-
fective in classifying emotions. A study by Wang
et al (2012) also shows that hashtags can be used
to create a high quality emotion dataset. They found
about 93.16% of the tweets having emotion hashtags
were relevant to the corresponding emotion.
However, none of this work investigated the use
of emotion hashtag lists to help classify emotions in
tweets. In cases where hashtags were used to collect
training data, the hashtags were manually selected
for each emotion class. In many cases, only the
name of the emotion classes were used for this pur-
pose. The work most closely related to our research
focus is the work of Wang et al (2011) where they
investigated several graph based algorithms to col-
lectively classify hashtag sentiments. However, their
work is focused on classifying hashtags of positive
and negative sentiment polarities, and they made use
of sentiment polarity of the individual tweets to clas-
sify hashtag sentiments. On the contrary, we learn
emotion hashtags and use the learned hashtag lists
to classify emotion tweets. To the best of our knowl-
edge, we are the first to present a bootstrapped learn-
ing framework to automatically learn emotion hash-
tags from unlabeled data.

3 Learning Emotion Hashtags via
Bootstrapping
3.1 Motivation
The hashtags that people use in tweets are often very
creative. While it is common to use just single word
hashtags (e.g., #angry), many hashtags are multi-
word phrases (e.g., #LoveHimSoMuch). People also
use elongated1 forms of words (e.g., #yaaaaay,
#goawaaay) to put emphasis on their emotional
state. In addition, words are often spelled creatively
by replacing a word with a number or replacing
some characters with phonetically similar characters
(e.g., #only4you, #YoureDaBest). While many of
these hashtags convey emotions, these stylistic vari-
ations in the use of hashtags make it very difficult
to create a repository of emotion hashtags manu-
ally. While emotion word lexicons exist (Yang et al,
2007a; Mohammad, 2012), and adding a ?#? symbol
as a prefix to these lexicon entries could potentially
give us lists of emotion hashtags, it would be un-
likely to find multi-word phrases or stylistic varia-
tions frequently used in tweets. This drives our mo-
tivation to automatically learn hashtags that are com-
monly used to express emotion in tweets.
3.2 Emotion Classes
For this research, we selected 5 prominent emo-
tion classes that are frequent in tweets: Af-
fection, Anger/Rage, Fear/Anxiety, Joy and Sad-
ness/Disappointment. We started by analyzing Par-
rott?s (Parrott, 2001) emotion taxonomy and how
these emotions are expressed in tweets. We also
wanted to ensure that the selected emotion classes
would have minimal overlap with each other. We
took Parrott?s primary emotion Joy and Fear2 di-
rectly. We merged Parrott?s secondary emotion Af-
fection and Lust into our Affection class and merged
Parrott?s secondary emotion Sadness and Disap-
pointment into our Sadness/Disappointment class,
since these emotions are often difficult to distinguish
from each other. Lastly, we mapped Parrott?s sec-
ondary emotion Rage to our Anger/Rage class di-
rectly. There were other emotions in Parrott?s tax-
onomy such as Surprise, Neglect, etc. that we did
1This feature has also been found to have a strong associa-
tion with sentiment polarities (Brody and Diakopoulos, 2011)
2we renamed the Fear class as Fear/Anxiety
not use for this research. In addition to the five emo-
tion classes, we used a None of the Above class for
tweets that do not carry any emotion or that carry an
emotion other than one of our five emotion classes.
3.3 Overview of Bootstrapping Framework
Figure 1: Bootstrapping Architecture
Figure 1 presents the framework of our bootstrap-
ping algorithm for learning emotion hashtags. The
algorithm runs in two steps. In the first step, the
bootstrapping process begins with five manually de-
fined ?seed? hashtags for each emotion class. For
each seed hashtag, we search Twitter for tweets that
contain the hashtag and label these tweets with the
emotion class associated with the hashtag. We use
these labeled tweets to train a supervised N-gram
classifier for every emotion e ? E, where E is the
set of emotion classes we are classifying.
In the next step, the emotion classifiers are applied
to a large pool of unlabeled tweets and we collect
the tweets that are labeled by the classifiers. From
these labeled tweets, we extract the hashtags found
in these tweets to create a candidate pool of emo-
tion hashtags. The hashtags in the candidate pool
are then scored and ranked and we select the most
highly ranked hashtags to add to a hashtag reposi-
tory for each emotion class.
Finally, we then search for tweets that contain
the learned hashtags in a pool of unlabeled tweets
and label each of these with the appropriate emotion
class. These newly labeled tweets are added to the
4
set of training instances. The emotion classifiers are
retrained using the larger set of training instances,
and the bootstrapping process continues.
3.4 Seeding
For each of the 5 emotion classes, we manually
selected 5 seed hashtags that we determined to be
strongly representative of the emotion. Before col-
lecting the initial training tweets containing the seed
hashtags, we manually searched in Twitter to en-
sure that these seed hashtags are frequently used by
tweeters. Table 1 presents our seed hashtags.
Emotion Classes Seed Hashtags
AFFECTION #loveyou, #sweetheart, #bff
#romantic, #soulmate
ANGER & #angry, #mad, #hateyou
RAGE #pissedoff, #furious
FEAR & #afraid, #petrified, #scared
ANXIETY #anxious, #worried
JOY #happy, #excited, #yay
#blessed, #thrilled
SADNESS & #sad, #depressed
DISAPPOINT- #disappointed, #unhappy
MENT #foreveralone
Table 1: Seed Emotion Hashtags
3.5 N-gram Tweet Classifier
The tweets acquired using the seed hashtags are used
as training instances to create emotion classifiers
with supervised learning. We first pre-process the
training instances by tokenizing the tweets with a
freely available tokenizer for Twitter (Owoputi et
al., 2013). Although it is not uncommon to express
emotion states in tweets with capitalized characters
inside words, the unique writing styles of the tweet-
ers often create many variations of the same words
and hashtags. We, therefore, normalized case to en-
sure generalization.
We trained one logistic regression classifier for
each emotion class. We chose logistic regression
as the classification algorithm because it produces
probabilities along with each prediction that we later
use to assign scores to candidate emotion hashtags.
As features, we used unigrams to represent all of
the words and hashtags in a tweet, but we removed
the seed hashtags that were used to select the tweets
(or the classifier would simply learn to recognize the
seed hashtags). Our hypothesis is that the seed hash-
tag will not be the only emotion indicator in a tweet,
most of the time. The goal is for the classifier to
learn to recognize words and/or additional hashtags
that are also indicative of the emotion. Additionally,
we removed from the feature set any user mentions
(by looking for words with ?@? prefix). We also re-
moved any word or hashtag from the feature set that
appeared only once in the training data.
For emotion e, we used the tweets containing
seed hashtags for e as the positive training instances
and the tweets containing hashtags for the other
emotions as negative instances. However, we also
needed to provide negative training instances that
do not belong to any of the 5 emotion classes. For
this purpose, we added 100,000 randomly collected
tweets to the training data. While it is possible that
some of these tweets are actually positive instances
for e, our hope is that the vast majority of them will
not belong to emotion e.
We experimented with feature options such as bi-
grams, unigrams with the ?#? symbol stripped off
from hashtags, etc., but the combination of unigrams
and hashtags as features worked the best. We used
the freely available java version of the LIBLINEAR
(Fan et al, 2008) package with its default parameter
settings for logistic regression.
3.6 Learning Emotion Hashtags
The next step is to learn emotion hashtags. We apply
the emotion classifiers to a pool of unlabeled tweets
and collect all of the tweets that the classifier can
label. For each emotion e ? E, we first create a can-
didate pool of emotion hashtags He, by collecting
all of the hashtags in the labeled tweets for emotion
e. To limit the size of the candidate pool, we dis-
carded hashtags with just one character or more than
20 characters, and imposed a frequency threshold of
10. We then score these hashtags to select the top N
emotion hashtags we feel most confident about.
To score each candidate hashtag h ? He, we com-
pute the average of the probabilities assigned by the
logistic regression classifier to all the tweets con-
taining hashtag h. We expect the classifier to as-
sign higher probabilities only to tweets it feels confi-
dent about. Therefore, if h conveys e, we expect that
5
the average probability of all the tweets containing
h will also be high. We select the top 10 emotion
hashtags for each emotion class e, and add them to
our list of learned hashtags for e.
3.7 Adding New Training Instances for
Bootstrapping
To facilitate the next stage of bootstrapping, we col-
lect all tweets from the unlabeled data that contain
hashtag h and label them with the emotion associ-
ated with h. By adding more training instances, we
expect to provide the classifiers with new tweets that
will contain a potentially more diverse set of words
that the classifiers can consider in the next stage of
the bootstrapping.
When the new tweets are added to the training set,
we remove the hashtags from them that we used for
labelling to avoid bias, and the bootstrapping pro-
cess continues. We ran the bootstrapped learning for
100 iterations. Since we learned 10 hashtags during
each iteration, we ended up with emotion hashtag
lists consisting of 1000 hashtags for each emotion.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Data Collection
To collect our initial training data, we searched Twit-
ter for the seed hashtags mentioned in Section 3.4
using Twitter?s Search API3 over a period of time.
To ensure that the collected tweets are written in En-
glish, we used a freely available language recognizer
trained for tweets (Carter et al, 2013). We filtered
out tweets that were marked as re-tweets using #rt or
beginning with ?rt?4 because re-tweets are in many
cases exactly the same or very similar to the origi-
nal. We also filtered out any tweet containing a URL
because if such a tweet contains emotion, it is pos-
sible that the emotion indicator may be present only
on the linked website (e.g., a link to a comic strip
followed by an emotion hashtag). After these filter-
ing steps, we ended up with a seed labeled training
dataset of 325,343 tweets.
In addition to the seed labeled data, we collected
random tweets using Twitter?s Streaming API5 over
a period of time to use as our pool of unlabeled
3https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search
4a typical convention to mark a tweet as a re-tweet
5https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis
tweets. Like the training data, we filtered out re-
tweets and tweets containing a URL as well as
tweets containing any of the seed hashtags. Since
our research focus is on learning emotion hashtags,
we also filtered out any tweet that did not have at
least one hashtag. After filtering, we ended up with
roughly 2.3 million unlabeled tweets.
4.2 Test Data
Since manual annotation is time consuming, to en-
sure that many tweets in our test data have at least
one of our 5 emotions, we manually selected 25
topic keywords/phrases6 that we considered to be
strongly associated with emotions, but not neces-
sarily any specific emotion. We then searched in
Twitter for any of these topic phrases and their cor-
responding hashtags. These 25 topic phrases are:
Prom, Exam, Graduation, Marriage, Divorce, Hus-
band, Wife, Boyfriend, Girlfriend, Job, Hire, Laid
Off, Retirement, Win, Lose, Accident, Failure, Suc-
cess, Spider, Loud Noise, Chest Pain, Storm, Home
Alone, No Sleep and Interview. Since the purpose of
collecting these tweets is to evaluate the quality and
coverage of the emotion hashtags that we learn, we
filtered out any tweet that did not have at least one
hashtag (other than the topic hashtag).
To annotate tweets with respect to emotion, two
annotators were given definitions of the 5 emotion
classes from Collins English Dictionary7, Parrott?s
(Parrott, 2001) emotion taxonomy of these 5 emo-
tions and additional annotation guidelines. The an-
notators were instructed to label each tweet with up
to two emotions. The instructions specified that the
emotion must be felt by the tweeter at the time the
tweet was written. After several trials and discus-
sions, the annotators reached a satisfactory agree-
ment level of 0.79 Kappa (?) (Carletta, 1996). The
annotation disagreements in these 500 tweets were
then adjudicated, and each annotator labeled an ad-
ditional 2,500 tweets. Altogether this gave us an
emotion annotated dataset of 5,500 tweets. We ran-
domly separated out 1,000 tweets from this collec-
tion as a tuning set, and used the remaining 4,500
tweets as evaluation data.
In Table 2, we present the emotion distribution in

tweets that were labeled using the seed hashtags in
the second column. In the next column, we present
the emotion distribution in the tweets that were an-
notated for evaluation by the human annotators.

4.3 Evaluating Emotion Hashtags
For comparison, we trained logistic regression clas-
sifiers with word unigrams and hashtags as features
for each emotion class, and performed 10-fold cross-
validation on the evaluation data. As a second base-
line for comparison, we added bigrams to the feature
set of the classifiers.
To decide on the optimum size of the lists for
each emotion class, we performed list lookup on the
tuning data that we had set aside before evaluation.
For any hashtag in a tweet in the tuning dataset, we
looked up that hashtag in our learned lists, and if
found, assigned the corresponding emotion as the
label for that tweet. We did this experiment starting
with only seeds in our lists, and incrementally in-
creased the sizes of the lists by 50 hashtags at each
experiment. We decided on the optimum size based
on the best F-measure obtained for each emotion
class. In Table 3, we show the list sizes we found to
achieve the best F-measure for each emotion class in
the tuning dataset.
Emotion List Sizes
AFFECTION 500
ANGER/RAGE 1000
FEAR/ANXIETY 850
JOY 1000
SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT 400
Table 3: Optimum list sizes decided from tuning dataset
To use the learned lists of emotion hashtags for
classifying emotions in tweets, we first used them as
features for the logistic regression classifiers. We
created 5 list features with binary values, one for
each emotion class. Whenever a tweet in the evalua-
tion data contained a hashtag from one of the learned
emotion hashtags lists, we set the value of that list
feature to be 1, and 0 otherwise. We used these
5 new features in addition to the word unigrams
and hashtag features, and evaluated the classification
performance of the logistic regression classifiers in
a 10-fold cross-validation setup by calculating pre-
cision, recall and F-measure.
Since the more confident hashtags are added to
the lists at the beginning stages of bootstrapping, we
also tried creating subsets from each list by group-
ing hashtags together that were learned after each 5
iterations of bootstrapping (50 hashtags in each sub-
set). We then created 20 list subset features for each
emotion with binary values, yielding 100 additional
features in total. We also evaluated this feature rep-
resentation of the hashtag lists in a 10-fold cross-
validation setup.
As a different approach, we also used the lists in-
dependently from the logistic regression classifiers.
For any hashtag in the evaluation tweets, we looked
up the hashtag in our learned lists. If the hashtag was
found, we assigned the corresponding emotion class
label to the tweet containing the hashtag. Lastly,
we combined the list lookup decisions with the de-
cisions of the baseline logistic regression classifiers
by taking a union of the decisions, i.e., if either as-
signed an emotion to a tweet, we assigned that emo-
tion as the label for the tweet. We present the results
of these different approaches in Section 5.
5 Results and Analysis
Table 4 shows the precision, recall and F-measure
of the N-gram classifier as well as several different
utilizations of the learned hashtag lists. The first and
the second row in Table 4 correspond to the results
for the baseline unigram classifier (UC) alone and
when bigrams are added to the feature set. These
baseline classifiers had low recall for most emotion
classes, suggesting that the N-grams and hashtags
are not adequate as features to recognize the emotion
classes.
Results of using the hashtag lists as 5 additional
features for the classifier are shown in the third row

Table 4: Emotion classification result (P = Precision, R = Recall, F = F-measure)
of Table 4. The hashtag lists consistently improve
precision and recall across all five emotions. Com-
pared to the unigram classifier, F-measure improved
by 6% for AFFECTION, by 9% for ANGER/RAGE,
by 8% for FEAR/ANXIETY, by 2% for JOY, and by
5% for SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. The next
row presents the results when the list subset fea-
tures were used. Using this feature representation
as opposed to using each list as a whole shows pre-
cision recall tradeoff as the classifier learns to rely
on the subsets of hashtags that are good, resulting in
improved precision for several emotion classes, but
recognizes emotions in fewer tweets, which resulted
in less recall.
The fifth and the sixth rows of Table 4 show re-
sults of list lookup only. As expected, seed lookup
recognizes emotions in tweets with high precision,
but does not recognize the emotions in many tweets
because the seed lists have only 5 hashtags per emo-
tion class. Comparatively, using learned hashtag
lists shows substantial improvement in recall as the
learned lists contain a lot more emotion hashtags
than the initial seeds.
Finally, the last two rows of Table 4 show classi-
fication performance of taking the union of the de-
cisions made by the unigram classifier and the deci-
sions made by matching against just the seed hash-
tags or the lists of learned hashtags. The union with
the seed hashtags lookup shows consistent improve-
ment across all emotion classes compared to the un-
igram baseline but the improvements are small. The

approach improves recall over the unigram baseline
by 17% for AFFECTION, 19% for ANGER/RAGE,
20% for FEAR/ANXIETY, 6% for JOY, and 9% for
SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT. At the same time,
we observe that despite this large recall gain, preci-
sion is about the same or just a little lower. As a re-
sult, we observe an overall F-measure improvement
of 9% for AFFECTION, 16% for ANGER/RAGE,
11% for FEAR/ANXIETY, 4% for JOY, and 7% for
SADNESS/DISAPPOINTMENT.

Table 6: Top 20 hashtags learned for each emotion class
age precision, recall and F-measure scores. We see
both types of feature representations of the hashtag
lists improve precision and recall across all emo-
tion classes over the N-gram classifier baselines.
Using the union of the classifier and list lookup,
we see a 12% recall gain with only 2% precision
drop in micro-average over the unigram baseline,
and 15% recall gain with only 2% precision drop
in macro-average. As a result, we see an overall
8% micro-average F-measure improvement and 9%
macro-average F-measure improvement.
In Table 6, we show the top 20 hashtags learned
in each emotion class by our bootstrapped learning.
While many of these hashtags express emotion, we
also notice a few hashtags representing reasons (e.g.,
#baddriver in FEAR/ANXIETY) that are strongly
associated with the corresponding emotion, as well
as common misspellings (e.g., #exicted in JOY).
6 Conclusions
In this research we have presented a bootstrapped
learning framework to automatically learn emotion
hashtags. Our approach makes use of supervi-
sion from seed hashtag labeled tweets, and through
a bootstrapping process, iteratively learns emotion
hashtags. We have experimented with several ap-
proaches to use the lists of emotion hashtags for
emotion classification and have found that the hash-
tag lists consistently improve emotion classification
performance in tweets. In future research, since our
bootstrapped learning approach does not rely on any
language specific techniques, we plan to learn emo-
tion hashtags in other prominent languages such as
Spanish, Portuguese, etc.
