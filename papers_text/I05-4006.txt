Abstract
This paper describes the structural an-
notation of a spoken dialogue corpus.
By statistically dealing with the corpus,
the automatic acquisition of dialogue-
structural rules is achieved. The di-
alogue structure is expressed as a bi-
nary tree and 789 dialogues consist-
ing of 8150 utterances in the CIAIR
speech corpus are annotated. To eval-
uate the scalability of the corpus for
creating dialogue-structural rules, a di-
alogue parsing experiment was con-
ducted.
1 Introduction
With the improvement of speech processing tech-
nologies, spoken dialogue systems that appropri-
ately respond to a user?s spontaneous utterances
and cooperatively execute a dialogue are desired.
It is important for cooperative spoken dialogue
systems to understand the intentions of a user?s
utterances, the purpose of the dialogue, and its
achievement state (Litman, 1990). To solve this
issue, several approaches have been so far pro-
posed. One of them is an approach in which the
system expresses the knowledge of the dialogue
with a frame and executes the dialogue accord-
ing to that frame (Goddeau, 1996; Niimi, 2001;
Oku, 2004). However, it is difficult to make a
frame that totally defines the content of the dia-
logue. Additionally, there is a tendency for the
dialogue style to be greatly affected by the frame.

In this paper, we describe the construction of
a structurally annotated spoken dialogue corpus.
By statistically dealing with the corpus, we can
achieve the automatic acquisition of dialogue-
structural rules. We suppose that the system can
figure out the state of the dialogue through the in-
cremental building of the dialogue structure.
We use the CIAIR in-car spoken dialogue cor-
pus (Kawaguchi, 2004; Kawaguchi, 2005), and
describe the dialogue structure as a binary tree.
The tree expresses the purpose of partial dia-
logues and the relations between utterances or
partial dialogues. The speaker?s intention tags
were provided in the transcription of the corpus.
We annotated 789 dialogues consisting of 8150
utterances. Due to the advantages of the dialogue-

Figure 3: A part of the LIT
structural rules being represented by context free
grammars, we were able to use an existing tech-
nique for natural language processing to reduce
the annotation burden.
In section 2, we explain the CIAIR in-car spo-
ken dialogue corpus and the speaker?s intention
tags. In sections 3 and 4, we discuss the design
policy of a structurally annotated spoken dialogue
corpus and the construction of the corpus. In sec-
tion 5, we evaluate the corpus.
2 Spoken Dialogue Corpus with Layered
Intention Tags
The Center for Integrated Acoustic Information
Research (CIAIR), Nagoya University, has been
compiling a database of in-car speech and di-
alogue since 1999, in order to achieve robust
spoken dialogue systems in actual usage envi-
ronments (Kawaguchi, 2004; Kawaguchi, 2005)?
This corpus has been recorded using more than
800 subjects. Each subject had conversations with
three types of dialogue system: a human operator,
the Wizard of OZ system, and the conversational
system.
In this project, a system was specially built in
a Data Collection Vehicle (DCV), shown in Fig-
ure 1, and was used for the synchronous recording
of multi-channel audio data, multi-channel video
data, and vehicle related data. All dialogue data
were transcribed according to transcription stan-
dards in compliance with CSJ (Corpus of Spon-
taneous Japanese) (Maekawa, 2000) and were as-
signed discourse tags such as fillers, hesitations,
and slips. An example of a transcript is shown in
Figure 2. Utterances were divided into utterance
units by a pause of 200 ms or more.
These dialogues are annotated by speech act
tags called Layered Intention Tags (LIT) (Irie,
2004(a)), which indicate the intentions of the
speaker?s utterances. LIT consists of four layers:
?Discourse act?, ?Action?, ?Object?, and ?Argu-
ment?. Figure 3 shows a part of the organization
of LIT. As Figure 3 shows, the lower layered in-
tention tag depends on the upper layered one. In
principle, one LIT is given to one utterance unit.
35,421 utterance units have been tagged by hand
(Irie, 2004(a)).
In this research, we use parts of the restau-
rant guide dialogues between a driver and a hu-
man operator. An example of the dialogue cor-
pus with LIT is shown in Table 1. In the col-
umn called Speaker, ?D? means a driver?s ut-
terance and ?O? means an operator?s one. We
used the Discourse act, Action, and Object layers
and extended them with speaker symbols such as
?D+Request+Search+Shop?. There are 41 types
of extended LIT. Because the ?Argument? layer
is too detailed to express the dialogue structure,
we omitted it.

3 Description of Dialogue Structure
3.1 Dialogue structure
In this research, we assume that the fundamental
unit of a dialogue is an utterance to which one LIT
is given. To make the structural analysis of the
dialogue more efficient, we express the dialogue
structure as a binary tree. We defined a category
called POD (Part-Of-Dialogue), according to the
observations of the restaurant guide task, that was
especially focused on what subject was dealt with.
As a result of this, 11 types of POD were built
(Table 2). Each node of a structural tree is labeled
with a POD or LIT. The dialogue structural tree
of Table 1 is shown in Figure 4.
3.2 The design policy of dialogue structure
To consider a dialogue as an LIT sequence, LIT
providing process (Irie, 2004(b)) usually should
be done. Furthermore, repairs and corrections are
eliminated because they do not provide LIT. In
this research, we used an LIT sequence provided
in the corpus. After that, the annotation of the
dialogue structure was done in the following way.
Merging utterances: When two adjoining utter-
ances such as request and answer, they seem
to be able to pair up and merge with an
42
appropriate POD. In Table 1, for example,
the utterance ?Should I make a reservation??
(#286) is a request and the answer to #286 is
?No, a reservation is not necessary?(#287).
In this way, utterances are combined with the
POD ?S INFO?.
When the LIT?s of two adjacent utter-
ances are corresponding, these utterances
are supposed to be paired and merged with
the same LIT. Utterance ?Fresh and roe?
(#280) and ?I want to have Hotpot? (#281)
are related to choosing the style of restau-
rant and are provided with the same LIT.
Therefore they are combined with the LIT
?D+Statement+Select+Genre?.
Merging partial dialogues: When two adjoin-
ing partial dialogues (i.e. a partial tree) are
composing another partial dialogue, they are
merged with a proper POD. In Table 1, for
example, a search dialogue (from #277 to
#285, SRCH) and a shop information dia-
logue helping search (from #286 to #287,
S INFO) are combined and labeled as the
POD ?SLCT?.
When the POD?s of two adjacent partial di-
alogues are corresponding, these dialogues
are merged with the same POD. Two search
dialogues (one is from #277 to #282, other
is from #283 to #285) are combined with the
same POD ?SRCH?.
The root of the tree: The POD of the root of the
tree is ?GUIDE?, because the domain of the
corpus is restaurant guide task.
4 Construction of Structurally
Annotated Spoken Dialogue Corpus
4.1 Work environment and procedures
We made a dialogue parser as a supportive envi-
ronment for annotating dialogue structures.
Applying the dialogue-structural rules, which
are obtained from annotated structural trees (like
Figure 4.), the parser analyzes the inputs of
the LIT sequences and the outputs off all avail-
able dialogue-structural trees. An annotator then
chooses the correct tree from the outputs. When

the outputs don?t include the correct tree, the an-
notator should rectify the wrong tree rewriting the
list form of the tree. In this way, we make the an-
notation more efficient.
The dialogue parser was implemented using the
bottom-up chart parsing (Kay, 1980). The struc-
tural rules were extracted from all annotated di-
alogues. In the environment outlined above, we
have worked at bootstrap building. That is, we
1. outputed the dialogue structures through the
parser.
2. chose and rectified the dialogue structure us-
ing an annotator.
3. extracted some structural rules from some
dialogue-structural trees.
We repeated these procedures and increased the
structural rules incrementally, so that the dialogue
parser improved it?s operational performance.
4.2 Structurally annotated dialogue corpus
We built a structurally annotated dialogue corpus
in the environment described in Section 4.1, us-
ing the restaurant guide dialogues in the CIAIR
corpus. The corpus includes 789 dialogues con-
sisting of 8150 utterances. One dialogue is com-
posed of 11.61 utterances. Table 3 shows them in
detail.

5 Evaluation of Structurally Annotated
Dialogue Corpus
To evaluate the scalability of the corpus for creat-
ing dialogue-structural rules, a dialogue parsing
experiment was conducted. In the experiment,
all 789 dialogues were divided into two data sets.
One of them is the test data consists of 100 dia-
logues and the other is the training data consists
of 689 dialogues. Furthermore, the training data
were divided into 10 training sets.
By increasing the training data sets, we ex-
tracted the probabilistic structural-rules from each
data. We then parsed the test data using the rules
and ranked their results by probability.
In the evaluation, the coverage rate, the correct
rate, and the N-best correct rate were used.

ranked from 1-best to 10-best, are shown in Fig-
ure 6.
In Figure 5, both the coverage rate and the cor-
rect rate improved as the training data was in-
creased. The coverage rate of the training set con-
sisting of 689 dialogues was 92%. This means

Figure 6: The relation between the size of training data
and the n-best correct rate.
that the rules that were from the training set en-
abled the parsing of a wide variety dialogues. The
fact the correct rate was 86% shows that, using the
rules, the correct structures can be built for a large
number of dialogues.
Three in eight failure dialogues had continued
after a guidance for a restaurant. Therefore, we
assume that offering guidance to a restaurant is a
termination of the dialogue, in which case they
couldn?t be analyzed. Another three dialogues
couldn?t be analyzed because they included some
LIT which rarely appeared in the training data.
The cause of failure in the other two dialogues is
that an utterance that should be combined with its
adjoining utterance is abbreviated.
Figure 6 shows that the 10-best correct rate for
45
the training set consisting of 689 dialogues was
80%. Therefore the correct rate is 86%, and ap-
proximately 93% (80/86) of the dialogues that can
be correctly analyzed include the correct tree in
their top-10. According to Figure 5, the number
of average parse trees increased with the growth
of the training data. However, most of the di-
alogues that can be analyzed correctly are sup-
posed to include the correct tree in their top-10.
Therefore, it is enough to refer to the top-10 in a
situation where the correct one should be chosen
from the set of candidates, such as in the speech
prediction and the dialogue control. As a result,
the high-speed processing is achieved.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we described the construction of
a structurally annotated spoken dialogue corpus.
From observating the restaurant guide dialogues,
we designed the policy of the dialogue structure
and annotated 789 dialogues consisting of 8150
utterances. Furthermore, we have evaluated the
scalability of the corpus for creating dialogue-
structural rules.
We now introduce the application field of the
structurally annotated dialogue corpus.
Discourse analysis: Using a POD labeled infor-
mation for each partial structure of the dia-
logue, we can obtain information such as the
structure of the domain, the user?s tasks, the
dialogue formats, etc.
Speech prediction and dialogue control: A
system builds the structure of an input up to
date and extracts the dialogue example that
is most similar to the structure of the input
from the corpus. If the next utterance or LIT
of the extracted dialogue is the user?s, the
system waits for the user?s utterance and
predicts its meaning and intention. If the
system?s utterance is next, the system uses
the utterance or LIT to control the dialogue.
At the present time, we have run up the data of the
corpus and built probabilistic dialogue-structural
trees. Next, we will apply the trees to some com-
ponents of the spoken dialogue systems such as
speech prediction and dialogue control.
