Abstract
In this paper, we explore the phenomenon
of Similar Place Avoidance (SPA), ac-
cording to which successive consonants
within stems sharing the same place of
articulation are avoided. This principle
has recently been hypothesized as a uni-
versal tendency although evidence from
only a few languages scattered across the
world has been considered. Using meth-
ods taken from the field of Visual Analyt-
ics, which have demonstrably been shown
to help with understanding complex in-
teractions across large data sets, we in-
vestigated a large crosslinguistic lexical
database (comprising data on more than
4,500 languages) and found that a univer-
sal tendency can indeed be maintained.
1 Introduction
Linguistic knowledge has traditionally been ac-
quired by analyzing a manageable set of data, on
the basis of which generalizations are posited that
can then be tested on an extended set of data from
the same language or comparative data from other
languages. Tendencies, rather than absolute prin-
ciples, are difficult to detect under this approach.
This is true especially when they are obscured by
counterexamples that happen to occur with high
frequency, but that may be restricted to just a
small minority of the overall pattern. This may
prompt a researcher to discard a valid generaliza-
tion from the outset. In recent years, a plethora of
statistical and stochastic methods have therefore
been pursued within linguistic research, leading to
approaches such as stochastic Optimality Theory
(Boersma and Hayes, 2001) or the use of statis-
tics to detect crosslinguistic tendencies (Bickel, in
press).
However, although the various statistical meth-
ods deal with data which exhibit very complex and
often ill-understood interactions, analyses have
not to date availed themselves of methodology
currently being developed in the field of Visual
Analytics, which allows us to use our powerful vi-
sual processing ability to understand and evaluate
complex data sets (Keim et al, 2008; Thomas and
Cook, 2005).
In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary
effort whereby linguistically interesting patterns
are automatically extracted, analyzed and visually
presented so that an at-a-glance evaluation of lin-
guistically significant patterns is made possible. In
order to demonstrate that this technique is espe-
cially useful with phenomena that do not mani-
fest themselves in absolute principles, but rather
in statistical tendencies, we investigated a phe-
nomenon that, on the basis of a comparatively
sparse and unrepresentative data set, has recently
been claimed to be a universal tendency (Pozdni-
akov and Segerer, 2007): Similar Place Avoidance
(SPA). In this paper, we conduct a more represen-
tative study of about 4,500 languages. Our results
allow an at-a-glance evaluation which shows that
SPA indeed seems to be a valid language universal
tendency.
Our work on SPA is part of a more widespread
effort currently being conducted with respect to vi-
sually representing crosslinguistic sound patterns.
In Rohrdantz et al (2010), we already showed that
phonological patterns in languages can be auto-
matically extracted and visualized from corpora.
Figure 1 displays the vowel harmony patterns that
were extracted for Turkish in comparison with the
lack of such patterns in a non-harmonic language
like Spanish.
The remainder of this article is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces SPA. Section 3 pro-
vides an overview of the material that was used. A
description of the calculations and statistical anal-
yses is given in Section 4. Section 5 presents
the results of the geo-spatial visualizations, partly

no such patterns can be detected.
with respect to a WALS map (Haspelmath et al,
2005). In the final section, we consider some im-
plications of our findings and raise some questions
for future research.
2 Similar Place Avoidance (SPA)
It has long been noted in studies on Semitic lan-
guages, especially Arabic, that there are con-
straints on the structure of triliteral consonant
roots (
?
CCC) with respect to the phonological
features of the individual consonants (Greenberg,
1950). The basic observation is that consonants
with a similar place of articulation are avoided
in non-derived forms. A similar observation has
also been made with respect to the Proto-Indo-
European (PIE) roots. Among other things, Iver-
son and Salmons (1992) note that Stop-V-Stop
roots were very rare in PIE, representing only
3.5% of a lexicon of more than 2,000 items. Plank
(1981:221f) observes that Modern German tends
to avoid verbal stems with identical consonants
in initial and final positions (allowing for differ-
ences in voicing), and that those verbs with iden-
tical initial and final consonants which do exist
are all morphologically regular. This indicates that
they are not basic verbs, but represent a technique
of word formation, perhaps derivative of redupli-
cation as especially common in child or child-
directed language.1
1Note that the early speech of children is characterized by
the opposite effect of SPA: both consonants and vowels tend
to share the same place of articulation (Fikkert and Levelt,
2010), with greater and greater differentiation being achieved
in the course of language acquisition. The reasons for this
remain to be investigated.
Looking at suprasegmental features, Leben
(1973) argued that a similar restriction holds for
the co-occurrence of tones in underlying repre-
sentations. In the framework of Autosegmental
Phonology this has become known as the Oblig-
atory Contour Principle (OCP), which precludes
sequences of identical tones from underlying rep-
resentations. This principle has since been under-
stood more generally as a prohibition on similar
items and has thus also been used in relation with
the SPA bias in Semitic radicals.
More recently, the application of SPA with
respect to stem-internal consonants has been
claimed for other non-Semitic languages as well.
Pozdniakov and Segerer (2007) found impres-
sive support for it in their sample of Atlantic
and Bantu languages of Niger-Congo and fur-
ther tested its crosslinguistic validity for some
more languages or language groups (Mande, Kwa,
Ubangi, Sara-Bongo-Bagirmi, Chadic, Malagasy,
Indo-European, Nostratic, Mongolian, Basque,
Quechua, Kamilaroi, Port Moresby Pidgin En-
glish) with similar results. Table 1 shows their
findings across all 31 languages in their sample.
It can be seen that the highest negative numbers
are in the main diagonal of the matrix, which is
exactly what SPA would predict.

cells with negative vs. positive values with regard
to successions of places of articulation (see Sec-
tion 3 for a description of the labels P, T, C and K)
for all languages in their sample. Positive and neg-
ative values have been assigned if the observed ab-
solute value was at least 15% above (respectively
below) the expected value. Compare their results
with the left matrix in Figure 3.
3 Database and methodology
The data that underlies all the subsequent work
presented in this paper have been taken from the
Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP;
Wichmann et al, 2010), which aims at achiev-
71
ing a computerized lexicostatistical analysis of the
world?s languages. To this end, Wichmann and his
collaborators have collected Swadesh list items for
over 4,500 languages. The so-called Swadesh list
was developed by Morris Swadesh in the 1940?
50s with the aim of having a basic set of vocabu-
lary items which are culturally neutral and which
one would expect to be stable over time. The orig-
inal idea of a Swadesh list was to be able to com-
pare and test languages with respect to genealogi-
cal relations.
The Swadesh items in the Wichmann et al
database are transcribed in the ASJP orthogra-
phy, which uses standard ASCII characters to en-
code the sounds of the world?s languages, but does
merge some of the distinctions made by the IPA.
Furthermore, stress, tone and vowel length are not
recorded in the database. However, for the pur-
pose of our investigation the transcription is suit-
able because place of articulation is sufficiently
distinguished.
We decided to experiment with two different ap-
proaches for dividing up the place of articulation
features. One approach (PTCK) is based on the ar-
rangement in Pozdniakov and Segerer (2007) and
distinguishes four places of articulation for labial
(P), dental (and alveolar) (T), (alveo-)palatal (C)
and velar (K) consonants. A second grouping
(LCD) only distinguishes three places of articula-
tion: labial (L), coronal (C) and dorsal (D).2 Ac-
cording to this classification the consonants of all
the items in the database can be assigned to one of
these symbols, as shown in Table 2.

All varieties of ?click?-sounds have been ignored.
2Radical and laryngeal, which are commonly employed
in the phonological literature as yet another place distinction,
are subsumed under dorsal.
Experiments with using the four-way distinc-
tion vs. the three-way distinction showed that T
and C in the four-way grouping behave very simi-
larly with respect to the transitions to other places
of articulation (see Section 4.2). We therefore de-
cided to use the three-way distinction for the bulk
of our calculations and visualizations and only
sporadically resort to the four-way grouping when
a more fine-grained distinction is needed.
Furthermore, we decided to only include those
cases where the first and second consonants are
preceded (or followed, respectively) by another
vowel or a word boundary and are therefore not
part of a consonant cluster. We mainly did this in
order to minimize the noise caused by consonants
of inflectional markers that tend to assimilate in
such clusters.
In the literature on root morphemes in Semitic,
it has been noted that the consonants within trilit-
eral radicals behave differently with respect to
OCP. Greenberg (1950:162) remarks that while
the first and second consonants are usually not
identical, the same does not hold for the sec-
ond and third consonants, which frequently consti-
tute the well-known geminate subtype of Semitic
verbs. However, for our work we understand OCP
as it was later formulated within the framework
of autosegmental phonology (Leben, 1973; Mc-
Carthy, 1986; Goldsmith, 1976) in that adjacent
identical elements (here in the sense of identical
with respect to place of articulation) are prohib-
ited, under the assumption that consonants are ad-
jacent to each other (on the C tier) even when they
are separated by vowels in the linear sequence of
phonemes within the word.
For the purposes of our experiment, we con-
sidered the relevant context for adjacency to be
one where consonants are separated by exactly one
vowel.3 Note that since the basis for our calcula-
tions were not stems in the language but the cita-
tion forms that are used in the Swadesh lists, we
also get noise from inflectional markers that are
attached to these forms and might have the same
place of articulation irrespective of the stem to
which they attach.4
Finally, there are several shortcomings of the
3Since vowel length is not marked in the ASJP database,
long vowels are also included.
4Assimilation processes are far more frequent than dis-
similation processes in this context so that it is more likely
that the same place of articulation features are to be expected
when an inflectional marker is present.

material in the database with respect to our investi-
gation which must be kept in mind. OCP/SPA has
been claimed to apply with respect to underlying
or non-derived representations. Previous work has
been done on the basis of stem (or root) lists. De-
pending on the language, Swadesh list items are
not always stems, but whole words in their cita-
tion forms. For instance, while both English and
German use the infinitive as the citation form for
verbal stems, in English the infinitive is identical
to the stem whereas in German it is marked with
the suffix -en. In other languages, verbs can also
be cited by inflected forms other than the infinitive
(e.g., the 3rd person singular perfective in Arabic,
or the first person singular indicative present in
Latin). The same holds for nouns or other word
classes that are included in the Swadesh list. An-
other problematic aspect is the fact that it also con-
tains items (such as personal pronouns) that are
not lexical in the strict sense of the meaning and
are realized as bound forms in many languages.
Apart from that, the number of items for each
language in the ASJP database varied greatly from
only a few to one hundred. Moreover, the num-
ber of CVC sequences within the items differed
greatly from one language to another, depending
on the phonotactic properties of the languages.
Previous statistical studies have relied on a much
larger number of stems and consonant sequences.
Pozdniakov and Segerer?s (2007) statistics, for ex-
ample, were calculated on the basis of 495 to
17,944 CVC successions for the languages in their
sample.5 In contrast, our statistics are based on
much fewer CVC successions, ranging from 21 to
246 per language. Nevertheless, our results actu-
ally correspond to the main findings of their study
so that we think that the data are good enough for
our purposes.
4 Automated statistical analysis
4.1 Methodology
In a first step, for each language in the sample
an elementary statistical processing is performed.
Thereby, all successions of places of articulation
occurring in the Swadesh list items are identified
and counted. To do so, we define a succession of
5Note that they also included cases where the first and
second consonant are part of a consonant cluster, which we
ignored for our calculations. Furthermore, those languages
where the number of consonant successions in the data was
20 or below were not included in our visualizations, thereby
reducing the number of languages from about 4,500 to 3,200.
places of articulation as a binary sequence of con-
sonants (C-C). These consonants have to appear
within a word and have to be separated by exactly
one vowel (V). Before and after the succession ei-
ther word boundaries (#) or vowels have to ap-
pear. Hence, the following regular expression is
used to extract C-C successions (marked in bold):
[#|V ]CV C[#|V ]. Next, each consonant is as-
signed to one of the three major articulation place
categories labial, coronal and dorsal. The succes-
sion counts are summarized in a quadratic matrix
where the rows represent the preceding place of ar-
ticulation and the columns the following place of
articulation. Each matrix cell contains the number
of times the respective place of articulation suc-
cession could be observed in the corpus. Subse-
quently, for each of the 9 possible successions a
contingency table was created (Table 3).
P2 ?P2
P1 A : n(P1 ? P2) B: n(P1 ? ?P2)
?P1 C : n(?P1 ? P2) D : n(?P1 ? ?P2)
Table 3: Contingency table for the articulation
place (P) succession from P1 to P2.
The succession counts were used to calculate ?
coefficients, where A,B,C and D correspond to
the four cells in Table 3.

The ? coefficient is a measure for the degree
of association between two variables which can
be derived from the fourfold ?2 statistical signif-
icance test (see Rummel, 1970:298f for details).
Sample ? values for the place of articulation suc-
cessions of Egyptian Arabic can be seen in Table
4. A visual representation of the same matrix is
provided in Figure 2. Note the at-a-glance analy-
sis made possible by Figure 2 vs. Table 4.

to alternate places of articulation can be observed
in most languages and in the overall matrix visu-
alizations including all data from all languages in
the database (Figure 4).
4.2 General relations among places of
articulation
As already mentioned, we tested whether it is use-
ful to distinguish the two different subcategories
dental (and alveolar) (T), and (alveo-)palatal (C).
Figure 3 shows the resulting association values ?
of place successions.
It can clearly be seen that T and C behave very
similarly. A further interesting observation is that
places of articulation tend to alternate (negative di-
agonal values for self-successions). As revealed in
the succession graph of Figure 3, the places of ar-
ticulation do not remain the same, but change to
the closest alternative(s). In the case of P and K
the closest distinct places of articulation (T and C)
are preferred. In the case of T and C, however, this
is somewhat different. Apparently, direct alterna-
tions between both are less probable. One plau-
sible explanation could be that they are not dis-
tinct enough and thus either K or P are preferred
as a following place of articulation, both having
roughly the same distance. These observations
led us to merge the places T and C in our further
analyses and distinguish labial, coronal and dorsal
consonants only, as in Figure 4.
Note that the cross pattern on the left in Figure
4, which now emerges very clearly, reinforces the
hypothesis that the closest distinct place of articu-
lation is preferred as successor.
Figure 4: The ? matrix considering only the three
main categories for all the data across languages.
In the left figure, the categories are sorted accord-
ing to their position in the oral cavity. In the
right figure, the categories are sorted automati-
cally, which shows that D and L are more similar
to each other than D and C.
4.3 Distribution across languages
Next, we examined the distribution of ? values for
self-successions of places of articulation in about
3,200 languages. Self-successions correspond to
the diagonal values of the ? matrices from the up-
per left to the lower right. As can be seen in the
histogram in Figure 6, the peak of the distribution
is clearly located in the area of negative associa-
tion values. In the box-plots of Figure 5, which
show the distributions for all three places of ar-
ticulation separately, it is clearly visible that for
each of the three places of articulation at least 75%
of the languages included show negative associa-
tions. Furthermore, it can be seen that most out-
liers disappear when taking only the languages for
which most data is available and thus statistics are
more reliable. The same can be seen in the scat-
ter plot in Figure 6, where the average ? value is
always negative if the number of successions ex-
ceeds a certain threshold. For all three categories,
the figures demonstrate that the same place of ar-
ticulation is generally less frequently maintained
than expected if there were no interdependencies
between consonant co-occurrences.
5 Visualization of geo-spatial patterns
The most common approach to visually represent
crosslinguistic information on areal (or genealog-
ical) patterns is to put each language as a single
pixel or a small icon to its location on a map.
For instance, the WALS database (Haspelmath et
al., 2005) includes 141 maps on diverse structural
(phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of
languages. We transformed the results of our SPA
statistics for each language in the ASJP database

of a succession (going from row to column category). The color saturation of the background indicates
the strength of association. In the left figure, places of articulation are sorted according to their position
in the oral cavity, in the middle figure an automatic similarity sorting of matrix rows and columns was
applied. The right part of the figure shows an alternative view only on those successions that have a
positive association.

outliers and reducing the variance.
that is also included in the WALS database into a
WALS map (Figure 7). The matrix visualization
has been simplified in that the color of the icon
represents the number of cells in the diagonal of
the matrix whose value was below zero, i.e., the
higher the number (0-3) the better the language
conforms to SPA.
Some of the drawbacks of these maps include a
high degree of overlap of data points in densely
populated areas and the lack of correlation be-
tween information content and area size. In Figure
7, the fact that those languages with fewer negative
diagonal cells are plotted on top of those with a
higher number slightly distorts the overall picture
that most languages adhere to the principle.6 Be-
sides that, the overall pattern in the densely popu-
lated areas is hardly visible, while sparsely popu-
lated areas waste space and hide the informational
6Likewise, the visualization would suggest to much ad-
herence to the principle if those languages with more nega-
tive diagonal cells were plotted on top of those with fewer
negative cells.

Figure 6: The scatter plot on the left displays the average ? values for self-successions of all places of
articulation depending on the number of consonant successions (CVC) for each language in the sample.
The histogram on the right shows the distribution of association strength values (?) for self-successions
of places of articulation in more than 3200 languages.
details. Finally, small clusters are difficult to find
? they are not noticeable, and are sometimes even
obscured by large clusters.
In order to avoid overlapping pixels we used
a circular arrangement around the original loca-
tion in the current analysis, taking the given order-
ing of elements into account (Bak et al, 2009a).
The ordering usually corresponds to the coloring
attribute starting with colors that occur least fre-
quently. With this arrangement a natural looking
visualization without artifacts is generated.
A way to obtain more space for regions with a
high point density are Cartograms, which distort
regions such that their size corresponds to a statis-
tical attribute (Bak et al, 2009b; Tobler, 2004), in
this case the number of languages in the database.
The advantage is that more space is reserved to
plot all important information on the map. In Fig-
ure 8, we show the density equalized distortion by
cartograms and the overlap-free representation of
the data points using pixel placement. Neighbor-
hood relations and region shapes are at the same
time maintained as accurately as possible in order
to guarantee recognizability despite of distortion.
The visualization reveals several clusters of non-
conforming languages (marked with boxes). It re-
mains for future work to investigate whether these
clusters are an artifact of the database that we used
or if they manifest an areal feature. Figure 8, in
contrast to Figure 7, shows the 3,200 languages
we investigated more closely and not just the ones
included in WALS.
The representation thereby enables investigat-
ing spatial patterns free of hidden data and distri-
butional biases.
6 Conclusions and future work
Our crosslinguistic investigation of SPA has con-
firmed the hypothesis that the phenomenon of
Similar Place Avoidance is not a particular trait
of Semitic languages, for which it was previously
described, but is a linguistic universal tendency
which can be observed in languages which are
both genealogically and geographically unrelated.
This can clearly be seen in the visualizations that
display the conformity of each language in the
database with respect to SPA. The overall pic-
ture for all languages not only shows that succes-
sive consonants with the same place of articulation
tend to be avoided, but also that there is a tendency
to avoid places of articulation that are too far away
from the preceding place (cf. Figures 3 and 4).
We combine methods from statistics, NLP and
Visual Analytics to provide a novel way of auto-
matically assessing and visualizing linguistic fea-
tures across a wide range of languages, thus al-

Figure 7: WALS map of the languages and their behavior with respect to SPA. The color indicates the
number of self-succession ? values which are negative, i.e., which adhere to the SPA principle. Color
mapping is from blue (conforming to SPA) to red. The numbers in square brackets indicate the number
of languages in this group.
Figure 8: Density equalized distribution of the languages with respect to SPA. The area of the geographic
regions corresponds to the number of languages in that location ? represented by dots. Overlap is avoided
using pixel-placement. The color mapping corresponds to the one used in the WALS map (Figure 7). Lo-
cations of nonconforming languages are highlighted with red boxes. Note that the number of languages
in this map is about twice the number in the WALS map (7).

lowing for a gain of new insights and raising fur-
ther interesting research questions that otherwise
might easily go unrecognized.
With respect to SPA a more detailed exploration
of the intricacies of phonological interdepencies is
needed as part of our more widespread study of
visually representing sound patterns in languages.
As already hinted at in Pozdniakov and Segerer
(2007), there are various other fascinating phe-
nomena that are worth looking at, especially in re-
gard to the interaction of vowels and consonants or
vowel dependencies (such as vowel harmony) and
consonant dependencies (such as SPA or conso-
nant harmony). In particular, one could investigate
why some languages apparently do not conform to
SPA and if there is any co-variation to be uncov-
ered between the adherence to the principle and
other factors that might be interesting to explore
and possibly reveal new insights into the structure
of languages.
