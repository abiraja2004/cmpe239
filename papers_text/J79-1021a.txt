ABSTRACT 
Ihe maohine translation problem has recently been replaced 
by much narrower goals and computer processing of language has 
become part df artificial intelligence (AI), speech recognition, 
and structural pattern recognition. These are each specialized 
computer science research fields with distinct objectives and 
assumptions. The narrower goals involve making it possible for 
a computer user to employ a near natural-language mode for 
problem-salving, information retrieval, and other applications. 
Naturdl computer responses have also been created and a special 
term, "understanding", has been used to describe the resulting 
computek-human dialogues. Phe purpose of this paper is to 
survey these recent developments to make the A1 literature ac- 
cessible to researchers mainly interested in computation on 
written text or spoken language. 
1, INTRODUCTION 
The computer literature discussed in this paper uses 
several linguistic terms in special ways, when there is a 
possibility sf congusion, quotation marks will be used to 
identify technical terms in computer science. The term 
"understanding" is frequently used as a synonym for "the addi- 
tion of logical relationships or semantics to syntactic pro- 
cessing". This use is substantially qarrower than the word's 
implicit association with "human behavior implemented by 
computer'' the narrower use is introduced as a neutral refe- 
rence point, The question of whether a computer porgram can 
operate in a human-like way is central to artificial intelli- 
gence. "Do current 'understanding' program systems show how 
extended human-like capability can be implemented using com- 
puters?" is a related pragmatic questton Initially this 
investigation sought to examine whether programs which "under- 
stand" language in the stipulated narrow sense are protatypes 
which could lead to expanded capability. Unfortunately, 
"language understanding" and its special subtopic "speeeh 
understanding'' are insufficiently developed to permit profi- 
table discussion of the original question Hence an opera- 
tional approach to the recent literature is taken here. This 
paper outlines how "language understanding" research has evolved 
and identifies key elements of program organization used to 
achieve limited computer "understanding". 
2, LEVEL AND DOMAIN 
Current A 1  programs for lankuage processing are organized 
by level and restricted to specified domains. This section 
presents those ideas and comments on the limitations that 
they entail. 
Three principal levels of language-processing software are 
1. "Lexical" (allowed vocabulary) 
2. "Syntactic" (allowed phrases or sentences) 
3 "Semantic" (allowed meanings) 
ln practice all these levels must operate many times for the 
computer to interpret even a small portion, say two words, of 
restricted natural-language input. Programs that perform 
operations on each level are, respectively, 
1. Word in a table? 
2. Word string acceptable grammatically? 
3. Word string acceptable logically? 
A program to detect "meaning" (logical consequences of word 
interpretations) must also perform grammatical operations for 
certain words to determine a part of speech (noun, verb, adjec- 
tive, etc.) One method makes a tentative assigrlment, parses, 
then tests for plausibility via consistency with known facts. 
To reduce the complexity of this task, the designer limits 
the subset of language allower or the "world" (i.e. the subject) 
discussed. The word "domain" sums up this concept, other terms 
for "restricted domain" are "limited scope of discourse", 
"narrow problem domain", and "restricted English framework" 
The limitation of vocabulary or context constrains the 
lexicon and semantics of the "language". The t rend i n  t h e  
design of software for "natural-language understanding" is 
to deal with (a) a specialized vocabulary, and (b) a parti- 
cular context or set  of allowed interpretations in order to 
reduce processing time. Although computing results for several 
highly specialized problems Le,g. 7, 231 are impressive exam- 
ples of language processing in restricted domains, they do 
not answer several key concerns. 
1.  Do specialized vocabularies have sufficient 
complexity to warrant comparison with true 
natural language? 
2 .  Are current "understanding" programs, orga- 
nized by level and using domain reatrictidn, 
extendable to true natural language? 
The realities are severe. Syntactic processing is interdependent 
with meaning and involves the allowed logical relationships 
among words %n the lexicon. Most natural-language software is 
highly developed at the "syntactic" level Howwer, the number 
of times the "syntactic" level must be ent'ered can grow explo- 
sively as the "naturalness" of the language to be processed 
increases. Success on artificial domains cannot imply a great 
deal about processing truly natural language. 
3 ,  PROGRAM SYSTEMS 
The systems cited in this section answer questions, per- 
form commands, or conduct dialogues. 
Programs that enable a user to execute a task via computer 
in an on-line mode are generally called "interactive" Some 
systems are so rich in their language-processing capability 
that they are called "conversational" Systems that have 
complicated capabilities and can reply with a sophisticated 
tesponse to an inquiry are called "question answering". The 
survey [I] discusses two "conversational" pkograms ELIZA 
[2, 31 and STUDENT [41, which answers questions regarding 
algebraic word problems. SIR [51 answers questions about 
logic. Both [41 and [51 appear in [61 , the introd,rction 
there provides a general discussion of "semantic information 
and computer programs involving "semantics" 
The "question-answering" program systems described in 
[2 -51 were sophisticated mainly in methods of solving a prob- 
lem or determining a response to a statement. Other systems 
have emphasized the retrieval of facts encoded in English. 
The "blocks-world" system described in [71 contrasts with 
these in that it has sophisticated language-processing capa- 
bility It infers antecedents of pronouns and resolves ambi- 
guities in input word strings regarding blocks on a table. 
The distinction between "interactive", "conversational", and 
"question-answering" is less important when the blocks-world 
is the. domain. The computer-science contribution is a program 
to interaet ,wfth the domain as if it could "underktand" the 
input, in the sense that it takes the proper action even when 
the input is somewhat ambiguous. To resolve ambiguities the 
program refers to existing relationships among the blocks. 
The effect of [71  was to provide a sophisticated example of 
computer "understanding" which led to attempts to apply simi- 
lar principLes to speech inputs. (More detail on parallel de- 
velopments in speech processing is presented later.) 
The early "language-understanding" systems, BASEBALL [ 9 ] ,  
ELLZA, and STUDENT, were based on two special formats: one to 
represent the knowledge they store and one to find meaning in 
the English input. They discard all input information which 
cannot be transformed for internal storage. The comparison 
of ELIZA and STUDENT in [I] is with regard to the degree of 
"understanding" ELIZA responds either by transfoiming the 
input sentence (essentially mimicry) following isolation of a 
key word or by using a prestored content-free remark. STUDENT 
translates natural-language "descriptions of algebraic equations, 
... proceeds to identify the unknowns involved and the relation- 
ships which hold between them, and (obtains and solves) a set 
of equations" [ I ,  p 851. Hence ELIZA munderstands" only a few 
key words; it transf6rms these words via a seatence-reassembly 
rule, discards other parts of the sentence, and adds stock 
phrases to create the response. STUDENT solves the underlying 
algebraic problem-- i t "unders'tands" in that it "answers questions 
based on information contained in the input" [4, p. 1351 . ELIZA 
responds but does not "understand", since the reply has little 
to do with the information in the input sentence, but rather 
serves to keep the person in a dialogue. 
Programs with an ability to spout back similar to ELIZA's 
usually store a body of text and an indexing scheme to it. This 
approach has obvious limitations and was replaced by systems 
that use a formal representation to store limited logical 
concepts associated with the text. One of them is SIR, which 
can deduce set relationships anong objects described by natural 
language. SIR is designed to meet the requirement that "in 
addition tu echoing, upon request, the facts it has been 
given, a machine which 'understands' must be able to recog- 
nize the logical implications of those facts. It alqo must 
be able to identify (from a large data store) facts which are 
relevant to 8 particular question'' [51 . 
Limited-logic systems are important because they provide 
methods to represent complex facts encoded in English-language 
statements so that the facts can be used by computer programs 
or accessed by a person who did not input the original textual 
statement of the fact. Such a second user may employ a com- 
pletely different form of language encoding. Programs of this 
sort include DEACON [lo, 111 and the early version of CONVERSE 
[121. The former could "handle time questions" and used 
a bottom-up analysis method which allowed questions 
to be nested. For example, the question "Who is 
the commander of the battalion at Fort Fubar?" was 
handled by first internally answering the questian 
"What battalion is at Fort Fubar?" The answer was 
then substituted directly into the original question 
to make ic "Who is the commander of the 69th batta- 
lion?" which the system then answered. [7 ,  p. 371 
CONVERSE contained provisions for allwing even more complex 
forms of input questions (Recent versions are described in 
113-151 .) 
Deductive systems can be divided into general systems 
which add a flrst-order predicate-calculus theorem-proving 
capability to limited-loglc systems to improve the complexity 
oE the facts they can "infer", and proccdurnl systcms which 
enable other computations to obtain complex information The 
theorem-proving capability is designed to work Erom a group 
of logical statements given as input (or statements consistent 
with the'se input s-tements) However, facts INCONSISTENT 
with the original statements cannot always be detected and 
deductive systems quickly become impractical as the number of 
input statements (elementary facts, axioms) becomes large 
[ b ,  7, 161, since the time to obtain a proof grows to an im- 
practical length. Special programming languages (e.g. QA4 
[17, 181 , PLANNER [20 ,  211 ) , have added strategy capabilities 
and better methods of problem representation to reduce computing 
time to practical values 
QA4 (seeks) to develop natural, intuitive represen- 
tations of problems and problem-solving programs. 
(The user can) blend . . .  procedural and declarative 
information that includes explicit instructions, 
intuitive advice, and semantic definitions. ?171 
However, there is currently no body of evidence regarding the 
effectiveness of the programs written in this programming 
language or related ones on problem-solving tasks in general 
or "lapguage understanding1' in particular. There is a need 
for experimental evaluation of the strategies that the pro- 
gsahing language permits for "language understanding" problems. 
Procedural deductive systems facilitate the augmentation 
of an existing store of complex information. Usually systems 
require a new set of subprograms to deal with new data: 
each change in a subprogram may affect more of the 
other subprograms. The structure grows more awkward 
and difficult to generalize. . . .  Finally, the. system 
may become too unwieldy for further expkrimentation. 
15, p. 911 
In procedural systems the software is somewhat modular In 
19 "semantic primitives" were assumed to exist as LISP sub- 
routines. PLANNER 1201 allows complex information to be 
expressed as procedures without requiring user involvement 
with the details of interaction anong procedures (but [21] 
reports some second thoughts). 
The work of many other groups could be added to this 
survey. Recent work on REL, building on on [ l o ,  111 is 
reported in [36, 371; [24, 251 are relevant collections; and 
[26] is a survey paper. 
4, DEDUCTION 
In all of the program systems described thus far, "language 
understanding" depends on the "deductive capabilities" of the

special programing languages in another context appear in [ 2 2 ] .  
program, tha t  i s ,  i t s  a b i l i t y  to  "infer" f a c t s  and rela.tionships 
from given statements. In some cases deduction involves d is -  
cerning s t ruc tu re  i n  a s e t  of f a c t s  and r e l a t i m s h i p s .  This 
sect ion describes how "imderstanding" prOgrAmS qhemselves a r e  
s t ructured and how tha t  s t ruc ture  l imi t s  tfheir capabi l i ty  for  
general deduction. 
Theorem-proving programs use an inference r u l e  i l l u s -  
t r a t ed  i n  [ 2 3  p.  611 to  deduce new knowledge. A formal suc- 
cession of 1ogi.cal s teps ca l led  resolut ions leads t o  the new 
f a c t .  The example there  begins with P1 - P4 given: 
P1 i f  x i s  pa r t  of  v ,  and i f  v i s  par t  of y ,  then 
x i s  par t  of y;  
P2 a f inger  i s  pa r t  of a hand; 
P3 a hand i s  p a r t  of an arm; 
P4 an arm i s  p a r t  of a man 
A pr'oof tha t  
P9 a f inger  i s  pa r t  of a m a n  
i s  derived by s teps ,  such as  combining P1 and P2  to ge t  
P6 if a hand i s  par t  of y ,  then a f inger  i s  p a r t  of y 
Unfortunately, it i s  easy t o  move outs ide the domain where 
the computer can make useful  deductions, and the formal reso- 
lut ion process i s  extremely lengthy and thus prohibi t ively 
cost ly  i n  computer t i m e .  In [31, 321 i t  i s  shown tha t  some 
statements ("whol did not write ---?It) are unanswerable and 
tha t  there is no algorithm which can de tec t  whether a question 
stated i n  a zero-one log ica l  form can beb answered. Henc.e 
theorem proving is not: e-sential to "deduction" and "under- 
standing" systems, natural or artificial, must rely on other 
techniques, e . g . ,  outside information such as knowledge about 
Lhe domain. 
In most "understanding" programs, information on a primi 
tive level of processing can be inaccurate; for example, the 
identification of a sound string "blew" can be inaccurately 
"blue" Subsequent processing levels combine identified pri- 
mitives. If parts of speech are concerned, the level is syn- 
tactic; if meaning is involved, "semantic"; if domain is in- 
volved, the lave1 is that of the "world". Sach level can be 
an aid in a deductive process, leading to "understanding" an 
input segment of language. Programs NOW EXIST which opera- 
tionally satisfy most of the following points concerning 
"understanding" in narrow domains (emphasis has been added) 
Perhaps tha most importaht criterion for undersvand- 
ing a language is the ability TO RELATE THE INFORMA- 
TION CONTAINED in a sentence TO KNOWLEDGE PREVIOUSLY 
ACQUIRED. This IMPL IES  HAVING SOME KIND OF MEMORY 
STRUCTURE I N  WHICH THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS O F  VARIOUS 
PIECES O F  KNOWLEDGE ARE STORED AND I N T O  WHICH NEW 
INFORMATION MAY BE FJTTED . . .  The memory structure 
in these programs may be regarded as 3emantic, cog- 
nitive, or conceptual structures.,.these programs can 
make statements or answer questions based not only 
an the individual statemegts they were previausly 
t o l d ,  but also On THOSE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN 
CONCEPTS that were built up from separate sentences 
as information was incorporated into the structure . . .  
THE MEANINGS O F  THE TERMS STORED I N  MEMORY ARE PRE- 
C I S E L Y  THE TOTALITY O F  THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE 
WITH OTHER TERMS IN THE MEMORY. [28  pp.  3 - 4 )  
This has been accomplished through clever (and lengthy) com- 
puter programming, and by taking advantage of structure inhe- 
rent in special proklem domains such as stacking blocks on 
a table, moving chess pieces, and retrieving facts about a 
large naval organization. 
Program systems for understanding begin with a "front 
end": a portion designed to transform language input into a 
computer representatiort. The representation may be as simple 
as a character-by-character encoding of alphabetic, space 
marker, and punctuation elements. However, a complex "front 
end" could involve word and phrase detection anti encoding. 
The usual computer science term fol a computer representation 
is "data structure'' [271 and there are many types. The language 
processimg program DEACON used ring sqructures 1111, a repre- 
sentation frequently used to store queues. In principle a 
data structure can represent involved associations, but in 
practice simple order or ancestor relationships predominate 
Completely different and far more complex types of structure 
are inherent in natural language. For example, from 1281 
"The-professors signed a petition." is not true. 
has for valid interpretations: 
(a) The professors DIDN'T sign a petition. 
(b) THE PROFESSORS didn't sign a petition. 
( c )  The professors didn't sign a PETITION. 
(d) The professors di'dn't SIGN a petition: 
Iterative substitution of alternatives to deduce overall mean- 
ing yields cumbersome processing, especially when there are 
nested uncertainties. The recursive properties associated 
with the data structure term "list" [271 are not easily 
adapted to multiple meanings. Hence, representing linguistic 
data for computation is ah opwr a n d  fundamental researrh 
problem. Nevertheless, the programs which de~uce facts from 
language do so withnut a clear best technique for computer 
representation. To do this, restrictions on the language 
implicit in the input domain are used, and repeated process- 
ing by level (lexical, syntactic, semantic) is used in the 
absence of an efficient representation language. Data struc- 
tures that facilitate following the language structure are 
needed Existing programs provide special solutions to the 
problems of deductive processing in narrow language domains 
While these programs are not a general breaktht-ough in reure- 
senting language data for computation, they demonstrate that 
current programming t.echniques enable a us.eful "understanding" 
capability Furthermore, tbere is a reql potential for use 
ot the "understanding" in an interactive node to facilitate 
use of computers by nonspecialists and to tap fhe more sophis- 
ticated human understanding capabilities 
5 INTERACT I ON 
Research and computer program development desrgned to 
store multitudes of facts so that they can be accessed [ 2 9 ]  
qx combined [301 and "unders,tood (see pp. 3-10 in [301') in 
linguistic form (see pp. 11-17 of [30]) is highly relevant to 
recent research programs in text and speech understanding. 
When such a system is used a user might f a i l  to get a fact or 
relataonship because the natural-language subset chosen to 
represent his question was too righ--i.e., it includes a com- 
plex set of logical relationships not in the computer. Thos 
a block could result in a human-computer dialogue if the 
program has no logical connection between "garage" and "car" 
but only between "garage" and "house" (the program replies 
"OK" or "??'!I1 to user input sentences) 
I L I K E  CHEVROLETS. 
OK 
CHEVROLETS ARE E c o ~ o M I C A L .  
OK 
M.Y HOUSE HAS A LARGE GARAGE.  
O K  
I CAN GET TWO I N  
???  
The computer failed to "understand" that there was no change 
of discourse subject. This is an example of a "semantfo" 
failure w h i ~ h  could be overcome by interaction. That is; the 
human user would need to dnput one more meaning or associa- 
tion of a valid word so that computer "understanding" may be 
achieved. Syntactic blocks may also occur. M. Denicoff 
pointed out that in [7] 172 different syntactic features were 
used fox  a situation where there are no statements with psy- 
chological content and no use of simile. If the psychological 
meanings are added as in 1381, these features would not be 
enough to describe all the possible meanings of a text drawn 
from a less artificial soprce. I n d e e d ,  a key problem which 
formal granhars seem ill-suited for is t h e  reality that many 
contexts may-be sifiultaneousLy valid: multiple meanings give 
natural-language communication the richness of ovextones, ana 
subtleties--poetry carries this ta an extreme. 
The above dialogue on "Chevroletsl' is an example of what 
Carbonell [ 3 9 ,  p. 1941 called "mixed-initiative discourse". 
This important aspect of interaction is considered in the LISP 
program DWIM ("Do What I .Mean1'), which is a useful working tool 
for text-input error correction precisely because it "under- 
stands" the user's character~stics . (For example, typical 
spelling errors .) This is discussed by Teitelman 140, 41 ,, 421 
A great deal of effort has been put into making DWI-N 
'-'smartn. Expkrience with perhaps a dazen different 
users indichtes we have been very successful: DWIM 
seldom fails to correct an error the user feels it 
should have, and almost never mistakenly corrects an 
error. [40 ,  p. 111 
Another limited-discourse interactive program 1431 facilitates 
introduction of expert knowledge on 7hess. The program uses 
search with a maxitnum look-ahead depth of 20 and has back- 
tracking capability; both s,yntactic and semantic knowledge is 
incorporated. By grouping similar board positions (i.e., all 
involving a piece on cell 1, all involving a queen moue), it 
imposes semantic organization on the vast files to be searched 
and improves syntactic processing speed 
Bublication of 1443,  which coined the term "speech 
understanding", initiated,the natural next ,step toward use of 
the computer's "understandfng" capability. The goal of easy 
intqraction with the computer becomes more exciting with 
speech as input medium. Systems to  recognize both text and 
speech have used syntax and context [ 4 5 ,  461, but [471 added 
a comprehensive approach using multiple processing levels to 
resoLve ambiguities., In the dkrect successors of this work 
[ 8, 4 9 1 ,  the same Frocess of parriaL acceptance of primitive 
elements (phonemic candidates from digitized acoustic data) 
followed by lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing ko 
rank alternatives has shown significant success. Reddy (in a 
,Carnegie-Mellon University film on the Hearsay System) sta-tee 
hat on 144 connected utterances, involving 676 words, obtained 
from 5 speakers, performing 4 tasks (chess, news retrieval, 
medical diagnosis, and desk calculator use), req.uiring 28 to 
76-word vocabul~ries, t,he computer program recognition, in 
terms of words spotted and identified correctly, was 
a .  89% with all sources of kmm1edge 
. 67% without use of semantic bowledge 
c .  44% without use of sptactic or semantic knowledge 
These results were obtained in October 1973, and have been im- 
proved since [501. However, a key limitation of this form of 
computer speech "understandkng" is response rate. Reddy 
estimated that the third w~rd-accuracy figure (without use of 
syntactic and semantic knowledge) would have to be in excess 
of 90% to allow the program to achieve a near-human response 
speed. 
The nature of computer "understanding" programs leads to 
problems of combinatoric explosion in number of alternatives 
and this lessens the usefulness of multilevel program organi- 
zation (acoustic-phonetic, lexical, syntactic, semantic, 
domain, and user interactions) as much in speech processing as 
in text pro.cessing. Prototype speech "understanding" systems 
have been build 1 4 9 ,  501 and newer acoustic-phonetic and 
syntactic techniques have been incorporated into this work 
[ 4 9 ,  51, 521, yet it seems clear that the development of theory 
in prosody and grammar cannot provide a breakthrough to escape 
the combinatoric explosion. The reason is that the search of 
parse rrees and the use of semantics (look up related words) 
depend on a single context--both take geometrica'lly increasing 
amounts of computing time as the number of contexts grows. 
Furthermore, this increase in time is added onto that which 
occurs when the size of lexicon is expanded. ks words are 
added, the number of trees that can Be-produced by the gram- 
mar's rewriting rules in an attempt to "recognize" a string 
expqnds rapidly. Hence in speech as in text processing, 
"under,standihgn1 exists via computer yet it is not likely to 
lead to rhachine processing of truly natural language. Indeed 
the artificiality of speech "understanding" by computer is 
even greater than that of text input. The "moon rocks" text 
system [ 3 3 ,  351 used a vocabulary of 3500 words, while the 
speech "understanding" version based on it [5M used only 
250 words. 
The COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY of systems that recognize 
isolated words with 98.5% accuracy [531* and the need f o r  
a rapid human-computer input interface [ 5 4 ]  promise that the 
last word has not been spoken on "understanding". Research 
and development on language handling systems is continuing in 
t h e  hope of achieving useful "understanding". Indeed, Stan- 
ford Research ,Institute's Artificial Intelligence Center is 
basing its current work on the just-mentioned isolated-word 
recognizer. It is likeap that useful developments will occur 
where language, and probably spoken-language, "understanding" 
will be exhibtred. These developments will occur through 
careful design of tasks and use of advances in computer 
technology However, the general problem of machine' "under- 
standing" of natural language- -whether text Dr speech- - is not 
likely to be aided by these developments. 
7 CONCLUS IONS 
A large body of research in computer science is devoted 
to language processing. A survey of the program systems that 
*Threshold Technology Inc. has sold such a system to se -  
veral users. Their VIP-100 includes a miriicamputer dedicated 
to the recognition task; there are otker isolated-word systems 
[541 
have been reported shows that two main goals have emerged: 
1 To enable "intelligent" processing by the 
computer ("hrtificial intelligence") 
2. To produce a more useful way t o  access 
d a a  and solve problems ("man-machine 
interaction") 
Techniques in artificial intelligence and speech recognition 
have been developed to the extent that prototype computer 
program systems which exhibit "understanding" have been de- 
veloped for highly limited conrexts. To extend these pro- 
grams to larger subsets of natural language poses problens, 
it is unlikely that any of the yesearch directivns currently 
being explored will of thewselves "solve" the I1na.tural lan 
guage problem". (The techniques include, but are not limited 
to, further developments in artificial intelligence program- 
ming languages [17, 18 20, 21, 551.; refinements in theories 
of grammar; improved deductive ability, possibly by better 
theorem-proving techniques; and the introduction of stress- 
related features in the ehcoding of speech [52]. A useful 
collection of language models appears in [ 5 6 ] . )  Nevertheless, 
prorotype systems for "understanding" both text and speech are 
useful achievements of engineering, and spoken entry of data 
by humans to computers is beginning to be established by 
isolated-word re-cognizers which use a minicomputer dedicated 
to the task. A multiplicity of purposes beyond this simple 
but practical task of data entry are mentioned briefly in the 
foregoing discussion of "interaction". Developments along, 
the many diverse paths indicated under that heading are 
likely to be rapid in the future as practical "unders tanding"  
o f  subsets of l a n g u a g e  becomes part of computer technology

The selection of material through the current second yeas of 
AJCL's existence remains tentative. A survey of subscribes- 
members will be included in the last packet mailed during 1975 
to establish patterns of coverage for fdture years. 
Categorization Bf entries deepens as the field defines itself 
and the collection of literature against which new items can. 
be matched increases. The advice of members is welcome. 
Many summaries are authors' abstracts, sometimes edited for 
clarity, brevity, or completeness. Where possible, an infor- 
mative summary i.s provided. 
The Linguistic Documentation Centre of the University of 
Ottawa provides many entries; by editorial accident, some 
of the entries recently received from that source remain to 
be included in the next issue. AJCL gratefully adknowledges 
the assistance of Brian Harris and his colleagues. 
Some entries are reprinted with permission from Computer 
Abstracts.

Process models are rigorous, process specifications are made 
very exp l i c i t ,  and complexity ts handled by use of computera. A 
methodology should be re l i ab le ,  e f f i c i en t  and have integrat ive 
power. The d i s t inc t ive  strengths of the currenl  computer oriented 
methodology are (a) the  complexity of ,data and tzheory i s  easy t o  
accommodate, (b) t i m e  sequence and dependencies are preserved, and 
(c) a diversi ty of hypotheses can be tes ted .  Weaknesses are (a) 
experbents often take years t o  perform, (b) the  a c t i v i t y  i s  t reated 
as a programming exercise with the s ta tus  of data and program un- 
c lear ly  defined and (c) i n  attempting to be general on a part icular

There are two tasks for which methodologies are used, (a) 
building intelligent: machines, and (b) under standing human language 
performance, Both depend on the development of a 'device-indepen-

considers characters  as a directed abs t rac t  graph, of which 
the node set cons is t s  of t i p s ,  corners,  and junctions, and the  
branch s e t  ~ o n s i s t s  of l i n e  segments connecting pa i r s  of adjacent 
nodes. Classificat-ion of branch fypes produces features  which a r e  
t rea ted  as fuzzy variables .  A character  i s  represented by a fuzzly 
function which r e l a t e s  its fuzzy variables ,  and by the node pa i r  
involved in  each fuzzy variable.  After producing a representation 
of an unknown character recognition occurs when a previously learned 
character's representation is isomorphic t o  the unknown.

Various proposals are discussed, pr incipal ly  (1) Rankin, 
who has a two-level grammar, the f i r s t  gives the strokes and 
rules fo r  combination and the second expl icates  the order, with 
a recursive def in i t ion  of subframes . (2) Fuj imara has an inven- 
tory of strokes and operators.  For each s troke 3 functional 
points are isolated and operators define the l inking by reference 
t o  these points.  Applications include keyboard input ,  storage 
and r e t r i e v a l  o r  characters,  and automatic recognition. There 
are  two d i f fe ren t  approaches. One seeks a log ica l ly  e f f i c i en t

49 character classes were recognized at a greater than 99.4% rate. 
Feature values calculated utilizing a Gaussian point-to-line distance 
concept were used in a weighted minimum distance classifier. All 
character-dependent data are obtained through training techniques 
Both statistical linear regression and averaging methods are used

Augmented phrase structure grammars consist of phrase struc- 
ture rules with embedded conditions and structure building actions 
Data structures are records consisting of attribute-value pairs. 
Records can be actions, words, verb phrases, etc. There are three 
kinds of attributes: relations, whose value is a pointer to other 
records; properties, with values either numbers or character 
strings; and indicators, whose values have a role similar to lin- 
guistic featires. Structure building rules have a left part indi- 
cating the contiguous segments that must be present for a structure 
building operation, given in a right part, to  apply.

The hypothesis is that every language user knows as part of 
his recognitAon grammar, a set of highly specific diagnostics that 
he uses to decide deterministically what structure to build next at 
each point in the process of parsin a sentepce. This theory re- k jects 'backup as a standard contro mechamsm for parsing. A 
grammar is a set of modules. The parser works on two levels, a 
group level and a clause level. Group level modules work on a word 
buffer and build group level structures. Modules have a pattern, 
a pretest procedure and a body to be executed if the pattern matches 
and the pretest succeeds. If the parser fails, it keeps the struc- 
ture constructed to date, and makes whatever substructures it can 
from the remaining part.

of a linguistic vatiable is combined with the concept of a fuzzy 
set: the range of the numerical base variable, in ordering usagR, 
is not fixed for a given linguistic variable. Does not explain the 
computation of values of compound expressions from the values of 
their components. Not all adjectives can be related LO an under- 
lying numerical base. Other features involved in a complete anal- 
ysis are: average value, typical value, observed value, standard 
deviation of values and polarity.

If semantic primitives are seen as essentially djtfferent 
from words, this leads to attempts to justify them directly, 
usually psychological~y. Otherwise the justification is merely 
that they work. Primitives can be taken as a small natural 
language, with no essential difference betQeen primitives and 
mrde.  But the set of primitives cannot be extended indefinitely. 
ptherwise the distinction between the representation end the 
nntural language will be lost. If it is not possible to escape 
f r w  natural language into another realm, one cannot separate 
semantic representation from reasoning as is attempted. It is 
probably more sensible to say that natural. language understanding 
depends on reasoning rather than vice-versa.

A key feature of the system is that the semantic deep struc- 
ture of the non-verbal, behavioral, rules may be represented in the 
same network as the semantics for natural language grammars, and, 
as a consequence, provide non-verbal context for linguistic rules. 
The total system has the power of at least the 2nd Order predicate 
calculus.

Comprehension is a memory process; breaking computational 
under standing into sccbyrob-leem af parsirig and semantic iktetpre- 
tation has hindered progress with much effort wasted on the con- 
struction of parsers. A system is described in which a monitor 
takes words from a sentence one at a time, from left to right. 
From a lexicon expectatisns. of the word (or its root) are added 
to a master list of expectations. If an element of the master 
list evaluates m true', programs associated with the element 
are executed. The final structure built by the triggered expecta- 
tions is the meaning ~f the sentence.

Reasoning may be propositional ar by mental simulation wing 
visual imagery. In the latter situation, do people include acts 
and objects not present in a given story, but necessary to carry 
out the simulation. This has not yet been experimentally tested. 
Experiments have shown that a listener may simulate a story from 
the point of view of an observer or of a participaht in the story. 
One problem that this raises for AI, if a program can construct an 
interconnected structure from the text, is the non-uniqueness of 
this meaning representation, Another problem is that programs should 
not be designed to preserve all details, but then, what should be 
forgotten; point of view may be useful here

Listeners draw inferences from what they hear, but different 
listeners can make different inferences. One kind of inference in 
comprehension is in the context of given-new information: the speaker 
tries to construct the given and new information of each utterance, 
so that the listener is able to compute unique antecedents for the 
given information, and so that  he will not already have the new in- 
formation attached to the antecedent. Inference mechanisms include 
direct reference, identity, pronominalization, epithets, set member- 
ship, indirect reference by association, indirect reference by 
characterization, reaaons, causes, conseqQences, and concurrences. 
Bridging inferences need not be determinate, but in discourse they 
seemingly are, and further, are the inferences with fewest assump- 
tions. Both backward and forward inferences are possible, but only 
the former are determinate.

In generating natural language from a conceptual structure 
words and syntactic structure must be deduced from the information 
content of the message. Words are accounted for by a pattern mat- 
ching mechanism, a discrimination net. The case framework of verbs 
is one source of knowledge for choice of syntactic structure.

In therapeutic discourse the subject is not so much gener- 
ating discourse as regulating it. Statements are made, retracted, 
qualified and restated. The ERMA model simulates this. It has 
five stages, represented as CONNIVER contexts. The discourse 
stream has its source in a special program and then flows back 
and forth between the contexts before achieving its final expres- 
sion. Each context determines suitability for expression; whether 
it should be censored or passed on with suggestions for modifica- 
tion. Concepts are represented by means similar to Minsky's 
frames.

Technological computational linguistics is primarily con- 
cerned with software technology whereby computers can use and pro- 
cess natural language. Descriptive computational linguistics uses 
the computer a6 a means of developing an accurate and empirically 
valid model of linguistic and cognitive behaviors of human speakers. 
There is no inherent representation of intentions in the former, and 
experience is that it cannot easlly be generalized to.the latter. 
One problem of modeling is that important things are often hidden

Both propositional and non-propositional knowledge must exist. 
Interpretive processes during perception individuate and categorize 
objects. If an object cannot: be categorized then the object will 
be stored with analogic information. During verbalization analogic 
images will be compared with available category prototypes to decide 
on the best match for use in the utterance.

Aritificial Intelligence i n t o  Computer-Assisted Instruct ion 
(CAI) systems. H e  dreamed of a system which had  a data 
base of knowledge about a topic mat te r  and general 
information about  language and t h e  principles of tutor ial  
instruction. The  system could then  pursue a na tura l  
tutor ial  dialog with a student; sometimes following the 
student 's initiative, sometimes taking i t s  own int ia t ive,  bu t  
always generating i t s  statements rind responses i n  a na tura l  
way from i t s  general knowledge. T h i s  system contrasts 
sharply wi th  existing systems for  Computer-Assisted 
Instruct ion i n  which a relatively fixed sequence of questions 
and possible reponses have to be determined f o r  each topic. 
J a i m e  did construct working versions of h i s  &ream--in a 
system which he called SCHOLAR. B u t  h e  died befoi-e

It was a pleasure to  work with Jaime.  His  kindness and 
h i s  enthusiasm were infectious, and t h e  discussions we had 
wi th  him over the  years  were a great  s t imulus t o  o u r  own

greatly. 
Cognitive Science. T h i s  book contains studies in a new 
f ie ld we call cognitive science. Cognitive science includes 
elements of psychology, computer science, linguistics, 
philosophy, and education, b u t  i t  i s  more than  t h e  
intersection of these disciplines. The i r  integrat ion has 
produced a new set  of tools for  dealing w i t h  a broad range 
REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING 
of questions. In recent years, the interdctions among the 
workers in these fields has led to exciting new 
developments in our undemtanding of intelligent systems 
and the development of a science of cognition. The group 
of workers has pursued problem$ that  did not appear to be 
solvable from within any single discipline. It  is too early 
to predict the future course of this new interaction, but 
the work to date has been stimulating and inspiring. I t  i s  
our hope that  this  book can serve as an illustrntion of the 
type of problems Chat can be qq~roached through 
interdisciplinary cooperation. The participants in this book 
(and at  the conference) represent the fields sf Artificial 
Intelligence, Linguistics, and Psychology, all of whom work 
on similar problems but with different viewpoints. The 
book focuses on the common problems, hopefully acting as a 
way of bringing these issues to the attention of all workers 
in those fields related to cognitive science. 
Subject Matter. The book contains four sections. In the 
first section, Theory of Representotion,  general issues 
involved in building representations of knowledge are 
explored. Daniiel G. Bobrow proposes that solutions to a set 
of design issues be used as dimensions for comparing 
different represetltations, and he examines different forms 
such solutions might take. William A. Woods explores 
problems in representing natural-language statements in  
semantic networks, illustrating difficult theoretical issues 
by examples. Joseph D. Becker is concerned with the 
representation one can infer for behavioral systems whose 
internal workings cap not be observed directly, and he 
considers the interconnection of useful concepts such as 
hierarchical organization, system gaals, and resource 
conflicts Robert J. Bobrow and John Seely Brown present 
a model for an expert understander which can take a 
collection of data &scribing some situation, synthesize a 
contingent knoultedge structure which places the input drrta in 
the context of a larger structural organization, and which 
answers questions about the situation based only on the 
contingent knowledge structure. 
Section two, New Memory Models, discusses the 
implications of the assumption that  input information is 
always interpreted in  terms of large structural units derived 
REPFLESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING 
from esporionce. Daniel G. Bobrow and Donnld A. Norman 
postulate active sciicrnnla i n  memory which r ~ f e r  to each 
other through use of car~tuxl-deper~derlt descriptions, and 
whir11 respo~irl both to input  data and to hypothcs~s  about 
structure. Benjamin J. Kuipers describes thc  conc~l ) t  of a 
frame us a structural organizing uni t  for  data ele~nents, nnd 
he discusses the use of these uni ts  in the context of n 
recognition system. Terry Winogrod explores issues 
i~lvolved in the controversy on rcl~rcsc~lt ing knowledge iu  
declarative vcrsus procedural form. Winogr~t l  uses the 
concept of a frame ns a basis for the synthesis of the 
declarative and proccdural tipproaches. The frame provides 
an organizing structure on which to attach both declarative 
and procedural informhtion. 
T h e  third section, l l i g h e r  Level  S t r u c t u r e s ,  focuses on 
the representation of plans, episodes, and stories within 
memory. David E. Rumelhart proposes a grammar for  well- 
formed stories. 'His summarization rules for stories based 
on t h i s  grammar seem to provide reasonable predictions of 
human behavior. Roger C. Schank postulates that i n  
understanding paragraphs, the  reader fills in causal 
connections between propositions, and t h a t  such causally 
linked chains are t h e  basis for  most human memory 
organization. Robert P Abelson defines a notation in 
which to describe the  intended effects of plans, and to 
express the conditions necessary for  achieving desired states. 
T h e  fourth section, Semantic Knowledge  i n  
U n d e r s t a n d e r  Sys tems ,  describes how knowledge has been 
used in  existing systems. John  Seely.Brown and Richard R. 
Bur ton  describe a system which uses multiple 
representations to achieve expertise in  teachiog a s tudent  
about  debugging electronic circuits. Bonnie Nash-Webber 
describes the role played by semantics in the understanding 
of continuous speech in a limited domain of discourse. 
Allan Collins, Eleanor H. Warnock, Nelleke Aiello, and 
Mark L. Viller  describe a continuation of work on Jaime 
Carbonell's SCHOLAR system. They examine how liumans 
use strategies to f ind  reasonable answers to questions fo r  
which they do net  have the knowledge to answer wi th  
certainty, and how people can be taught  t o  reason th i s  way.

Each frame has many statements about the topic, each expressed 
in a suitable semantic representation. The primary goal in under- 
standing is to find instances of frame statements in the discourse 
Questions about a source statement can be answered by reference to 
the frame of which it is en instance.

By systematic application of a cognitive network or similar 
theory of knowledge the internal structure of a (medical) code can 
be improved and tools developed for different purposes. Hays's 
theory uses paradigmatic, syntagmatic, discursive, attitudinal, and 
metalingual (MTL) arcs. The MTL arcs shift level of abstraction; 
e.g., anemia is neither a fewness nor an erythrocyte but an abstract 
condition. An abstract definition can include several syntagmatic 
propositions, linked discursively. A medical term can be linked by 
MTL to definitions in different languages (clinical, ~athophysio- 
logical, etc.)

Tulving's episodic memory is seen as a record of experiences 
and their context. However, both episodic and semantic memories 
must have similar power of representation, so their structures are 
not disttnguishable. Similarly, a lexical memory must have the 
power to represent propositional information about words. Thus, 
the fabric of knowledge is merely cut into different shapes.

The distinction between semantic and episodic memory is not 
so much one between different kinds of memo , but one between dif- 
'K ferent kinds of knowledge. The dbtinction as been rejected, be- 
cause it is said that since we know everything Erom experience, 
there is no room for the distinction. The error lies in confusing 
knowledge from knowledge, and knowledge of knowledge. Semantic 
knowledge is knowledge that has been reorganized around concepts 
from knowledge originally encoded around events; it fs stripped of 
personal experience. One question raised by the distinction is how 
does information get into semantic memory, and how and when does it 
get 10s t from episodic memory.

There is evidence that people use three-dimensional models 
and that they integrate several views into a single model. This 
is counter to the claim that we symbolically store a large number 
of separate views. Another problem is with the assumption of de- 
fault values for slots in frames. In the extreme, this gives 
visual perception without vision. The evidence is that people can 
understand totally unexpected images presented for quite short 
pexiods. A rhird point concerns the telatively static nature of 
frames. A better model is to condtruct a goal oriented subsystem 
making use of context specific knowledge.

ing error transformations to the productions of context-free gram- 
mars in order to generate new context-free grammars capable of des-

containing specific types of errors such as deleted, added, and inter-

Artificial Intelligence has had at least four benefits for 
the study of natural language: (a) emphasis on complex stored struc- 
tures, (b) emphasis pn the importance of real world knowledge, (c) 
em hasis on the communicative function of sentences in context, and 
(dy emphasis on the expression of rules, structure and information 
within the operational environment. The only test of a natural 
language system is its success on a task, any demand for more theory 
must bear this in mind. Neither can recent work in A 1  be regarded 
as theoretical; it is the semi-formal expression of intuition. A1 
is engineering, not a science, and as such there is no boundary to 
natural language; one counter example does not overthrow a rule sys- 
tem. Further, talk of theory distracts from heuristics.

There are two mechanisms for formal reasoning: (a) resolution 
pxinciple, a campetence model, b virtue of its completeness, and 
(b) natural deductive systems, w g ich are attempts to define a per-

that interfaces the two systems, each doing what it does best. 
Natural deductive systems have not considered fuzzy kinds of reas- 
onfng. Future questions concern other quanrifiers, concexrs for 
representing wanting, needing, etc., and the balance between com-

A model of reasoning about human action must include (1) how 
people arrive at a plan, (2) what can count as a reason for choosing 
to perform the plan, and (3) discovering plans and motivations from 
observation or linguistic report of actions. A plan is the internal 
representation or set of beliefs about how a particular goal may be 
achieved. The belief by an observer that an actor performed one 
act to enable a second to be performed can follow neither from deduc- 
tive nor inductive reasoning. An observer may have other propositions 
that are reasons for believing or nut believing that a plan correctly 
characterizes the beliefs of the actor. An act name organizes a set 
of beliefs about how a move of this type might relate to other moves, 
and the cognitive and motivational statea of the actors.

STRING AND LIST PROCESS I NG IN SNOBOL4: TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS

Among popular computer p r o g r d g  languages, SNOBOL4 stands out as the only 
one offering complex pattern definition and mtching capabilities. It also has 
a flexible function definition facility and programmer-defined data types. While 
not unique, these two features encourage problem-dependent extensions of the 
language. . All ? b e e  aspects of SNOBOLA fom the basic tools in Griswold's new 
book 
Intended as  a text  for the SNC1BON user (it i s  not an "introductoryt' text) ,  
it presents techniques for the representation and manipulation of data in string, 
list, or  otherwise "structured" fm. The text includes m y  programed examples, 
problems with a wide range of difficulty, and answers t o  m y  of these problems. 
The first Shree chapters develop pattern matching, function definition, and data 
s-tructures. The l a s t  four chapteFs examine particular application domiins: mthe- 
mt ics ,  cryptography, document ~ r p a r - ~ o r  , Plus a f e w  more specialized problems. 
Although th i s  m y  seem tb ignore c q u t a t i o n a l  linguistics, the greatest imnediate 
benefit fo r  the pmgranurter l i e s  in the fFrst  t h e  chapters anyway. 
Within C h a p  1, the section on g r a m w s  and patterns can be used for  the 
inIplemntation of simple syntactic analysis. For exaqle, there is a straight- 
forward mpping of a BNf g~mmar into SNOBON patterns, but there are pi t fa l l s  
(as well a s  scsne more efficient representations in the balance) that the programer 
ought t o  know. These are  c'arefully explained. 
A topic that I f e l t  was inadequately covered in Chapter 1 was the definition 
of the pattern mtching mechanism i t se l f .  The immediate presentation of examples 
using pattern rratchhg (page 2)  calls  for a brief overview of pattern mtchhg 
syntax and seman-tics. Surely a progrwnnw? muld appreciate not having t o  refer 
back t o  his in.troductory text should some p a t t e n  function or construct bebhazy 
in his memory. Even an appendix wuld be satisfactory. In addition, th is  would 
support the section on p t t e r n s  as  procedures by providing the underlying semantics 
for such tlprocedures. EUrther incentive for  i t s  inclusion i s  provided by. the 
excellent review of progt-annner-defined data types in Chapter 3. Why leave pattern 
mtching t o  the userJ.s recollection? 
The function definition fac i l i ty  discussed in Chapter 2 eraables the constructic 
of generic functions. Since there are no data type declarations for  function 
argunents or parwters, often only one function i s  required for the execution of 
related op&ations.on various data types. The proliferation of functions in a 
complex system might therefore be systemtically reduced., The burdeg fa l l s  on the 
progrmer, of course, to sort out +he admissible combinatians or appropriate 
actions. An addition function for real and cmplex numbers is discussed, where 
the f o m  is a SNOBOL4 primitive and the l a t t e r  i s  constructed from pmgrmer- 
defined data types. Although not in the realm of c q u t a t i o w l  linguistics, it 
does have a parallel, for exmple, in a function whi& inserts data into a semantic 
network and is expected to  handle various chunks of netwmk as well as atomic data. 
The data type might only be determined. during p r o p  execution; using a generic 
function avoids distracting logic within the user's primary function. 
The section on functions as generators is  a l i t t l e  weak from the point of 
view of computational linguistic requirements f a  procedures which generate suc- 
cessive alterna?ives frcmn a complex s-tructure, for  example, sentence parsing or 
referent resolution. The use of sjmple global variables is t m  l M t e d  in these 
contexts; one often heeds to become involved with saving the values of ~ e ~ e r a l  
l w a l  variables in special data blocks or stacking the decision pints associated 
with alternatives. The f i r s t  is a well-known compiler-design technique, while 
h e  second involves a backbxicking control struc'hxe. In fact ,  an excellent 
i l lustrat ion of these ideas would be an implementation of the SfJOBOL4 pattern 
matohing system in SNOBON. 
Chapter 3 i s  the m s t  useful because it desmibes how propammer-defined 
data types can be used t o  build "sh .u~ tu res~~:  stacks, queues, l h k e d  lists, 
binary trees, am3 trees. The sk i l l fu l  user of such representations w i l l  find a 
reduced role for complicated patterm mtchhg expressions because the implicit 
structure &coded into a str ing becomes d f e s t  i n  the explicit links of the 
s h c t u r e .  Not only is there often an economic advantage, but the semmtics of 
SNOBOL4-are easier t o  use than the implicit itcMracking semantics of pattern 
mtching. (Grimold himself p h t s  this out i n  the section on patterns as 
procedures. The prog~mner is encouraged t o  consider economic trade-offs in 
the hplemehtation of stcuchuws. Often overlooked questions are addressed: 
for  example, the relat ive merits of implementing stacks using s t r i n g s ,  arrays, 
tables, or defined data types. Programs for the use or traversal of structures 
are also provided. 
Although exercise 3.40 requests a representation fo r  directed graphs, neither 
hint nor answer i s  p v i d e d .  The c a n p u t a t i d  linguist having an h t e r e s t  in 
s m t i c  networks or similar associative structures is thus lef-t t o  his own exper- 
t i se .  ?he basic -tree representation mst be significantly d i f i e d  t o  incorporate 
labelled edges, a nears of eaversal  (search) t h m q h  the edge set, and, of course, 
non-txee structures. Gritwold apologizes for not covering every application, 
6 8 
but the generality and current popularity of networks fo r  the representation of 
knowledge cal ls  for expanded treatment of the topic. 
Among the appSications covered in de ta i l ,  the ones most relevant to ccsnpu- 
tat ional  linguistics include a Mndom sentence generator (fm a p r a ~ ~ ~ n a r ) ,  an
mcm processor, and (perhaps) a context editor. The input and output of textual 
m t e r i a l  is covered in depth undw d6cument prepmt ion  (Chapter 6). Since the 
text  does not delve into computational linguisfics p w  se, the reader (or instruc- 
tor)  w i l l  dften be called upon t o  map techniques described in the text  onto h i s  
own problem. I think that  a g k d  programer muld be able t o  perform this 'trans- 
formation since solutions are provided fo r  m y  of the basic problems i n  handling 
input text ,  setting up data structures, and traversing these structmes . 
Before you begin programming your next computational linguistics project, a

A practical guide for the occasional Fortran TV programmer to 
the basic "tricks" and vocabulary used by the systems programmers. 
 his  boo^ ranges over topics from plotting on a line printer to hash- 
ing and basic storage structures (stacks, queues, etc.) using a con- 
cise, to-the-point writing style. This style reinforces the stated 
intention of the book, which is to heLp a programmer with a problem 
by providing descriptions of non-mathematical techniques. The style 
and intention do limit the usefulness of this book, as some of the 
topics would be well known to advanced programmers and are not cov- 
ered in sufficient depth for such a person. It is then the area be- 
tween these two extr'emes to which this book is aimed, and there it 
can be of great service. 
The only important assumption made of the reader is that be know 
the variable types of Fortran (integer, real, Hollerith, etc.) and 
their attendant foymat specifications. A good knowledge of character 
formats is especially useful, although the major use for them is in 
output statements used in the examples given in the book. It is also 
assumed that the reader knows the basic Fortran statements, but this 
is simple matter as opposed to the format and variable type problems 
which confront a Fortran programmer. 
The bodk also includes several exercises at the end of each 
chapter (answers not supplied unfortunately) and a short but very 
complete bibliography which includes several sources for each chapter. 
The book's primary value is as a source for Hints to problems encoun- 
tered during programming, providing an introduction to the'more 
sophisticated literature which can be found by starting with the 
bibliography. This book is therefore a starting point for picking 
up a basic vocabulary, techniques, and references for someone who has 
just completed a programming course or who needs a quick introduction 
to some technique which he may want to look at later in more detail.

A computer graphics metaphor is useful for human visual ima- 
gery. Analogous oroperties are found: as objects become smaller 
their constituent parts become more difficult to discern perceptual- 
ly; as more parts are added to an image it becomes more degraded 
due to capacity limitations; image6 displaying more identifiable 
details take longer to construct; images cannot be indefinitely ex- 
panded before overflowing; and the existence of decay time for an 
image which affects the time taken to construct a riep Image.

Semantic structure is relative to the process that constructs 
and uses the representatton. By positing analogue representations 
it is suggested that a process does noc need to know the rules of 
transformation, e .g . ,  rotation, but this is impossible unless the 
analogical modelling medium intrinsically follows khe laws of 
physics, i.e., ascribing these laws to brain tissue.

Sensory data is considered as having several levels of inter- 
pretation. At the sensory end, the representation is analog, and 
propositional at the cognitive end. Analog images are incorrectly 
seen as having all details of the stimulus whereas quasi-linguistic 
representations are only partial. The important issue is not the 
partiality but the selection, possibly information that discrimin- 
ates the object&n_c~texJ, Fokstru_c_ral information there needs 
to be a mechanism for both parts ana wholes. Parametric informa- 
tion can be coded componentially and explicitly, but some seems to 
function integrally. It is claimed that structural perception is 
qualitative whereas parametric perception is quantitative, but 
structural elements may have quantitative aspects--its strength of 
association with different groups. Although both structure and par- 
ameters are encoded relative to other information, thexe is evidence 
of preferred orientation and perspectives for parameters

The distinction between Fregean (symbolic) and analogical 
representations is that in the latter both representation and 
thing must be complex and there must be correspondence between the 
structures, whereas in the farmer case there is no need for a 
correspondence. Attempts to subsume either representation under 
the other have not succeeded. There is a mistaken belief that only 
proofs in Fregean symbolism are rigorous. Although analogical 
representations can sometimes be implemented using Fregean ones, 
this does not imply that they are not used.

Discrimination value analysis ranks t e x t  words in accord.. 
ance with how well they are able to discriminare the documents of 
a collection from each other. The value of a term depends on how 
much the average separation between individual documents changes 
when the given term is assigned for content identification. The 
best words are those which achieve the greatest separation. Effec- 
tive criteria are given for assigning each term to either single 
word, phrase or word group categories and for constructing optimal 
indexing vocabularies. The theory is validated by citing experi- 
mental results.

The Medical Advances Institute developed a system to keep 
records, select cases for review, and information about individuals 
and categories, for the quality control system now established by 
law. Over 200 quality criteria packages have been developed. They 
concern the process and result of medical care. The system screens 
each case within a day of hospital admission and frequently there- 
after. It provides a review of use of facilities and conformity to 
standards of care.

Experimental results indfcate that final retrieval system 
performance, after user feedback is applied using Rocchio's al- 
gorithm, is highly dependent on the system performance of the 
initial indexing process. Thkrefore every tool which imgroves 
thc indexing performance as an outcome of the content analysis 
of natural language is beneficial because initial differences 
in a system performance are retained after user feedback is 
applied.

A review of volumes 1-10 of the 26-volume Concordantia Prima 
Ford Lewis Battles 
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary 
It is appmpriate indeed that, on the seven hundredth anniver- 
sary of the death of St. Thomas Aquinas, Father Roberto Busa with 
his co-workers of the Faculty of Philosophy at the Aloisianum, 
Gallarate, Italy has begun to publish the long awaited massive con- 
cordance to his writings and to texts by other authors long assoc- 
iated with his circle. For many of us who have done lesser work in 
computerized humanistic studies, rumors and reports of Busa's enter- 
prise aroused our curiosity and, in some cases, led us also to grapple 
with the manifold problems of producing a concordance by computer. 
In studying the specifications and sampling the first ten vol- 
umes of Index Thomisticus (Seatio 11, Concordantia Prima (A-Initor)) , 
this reviewer has been reminded of his own struggle to produce a con- 
cordance to the Institutes of ~ o h n  Calvin (Pittsburgh, 1972) . The r . T. 
provides a hierarchically organized concordance to a literary corpus 
of 10,600,000 words of Latin Texts; by comparison, the CaLvin concor- 
dance contains 405,338 words of Latin text in a single sequence. 
Thus, the vastly greater literary task of Busa called for a series 
of basic literary and philological and logical declsions not only 
to make the enormous work of processing possible, but also to pro- 
duce a final instrument for the use of scholars that would ration- 
ally encompass the vaat corpus. 
At the outset the character of the Latin language and espec- 
ially its morphological peculiarities had to be translated into com- 
puterizable routines, so that something other than a sea of raw a l -  
phabetical sdrting would result. Lematization by hand sorting 
after the basic concordancing (feasible for a small corpus), prepar- 
ation of an interlined ("glossed") lemmatized machine readable rext 
(also suitable for smaller texts), even the elaborated encoding of 
the text developed by De Latte at the Liege Centre - none of these 
methods was chosen by Busa and his associates. They turned rather 
to Forcellini ' s Lexicon tot ius ~ a t i n l h t i s  and encarded the 90,000 
Forcellini lemmata (in all possible forms) plus additional ones in 
the Thornistic corpus to a total of 10,000,000 codes, put this on 
magnetic tape, and worked out procedures to apply this Latin Machine 
Dictionary (LEL) to the machine-readable text. This instrument is 
now available fox the use of others working on Latin texts. To any- 
one knowing the homographs of Latin, the limitations of any mechan- 
ical routine are apparent: the T., however, handles these problems 
in a clear and workable manner. 
The size of the literary corpus also called for basic decisions 
by successively sequestering different fractions of the corpus (in a 
way that would have doubtless intrigued Thomas himselfl), the com- 
pilers reduced the mass to manageable proportions. Their decisions 
may be set down serially. 
(1) LITERARY. First, divide the authentic works of 
Thomas (100 + 181) from those of other authorship (61): 
treat each in separate series. Secondly, extract literal 
quotations, citations in references to other authors, and 
cross-citations to other Aquinian treatises; treat these 
sepaiately. This leaves distinct layers of mat'erial for 
concor dancing.. 
(2) PHILOLOGICAL. First, separat.e out indeclinable6 
like prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, f o m s  of esse , 
helping verbs, e t c . .  pronouns, numerals, etc., etc ; these 
will occupy a pareiaular concordance. Second, put the re- 
maining nouns, adjectives and verbs in a primary concordance: 
nbuns and adjectives arranged alphabetically by termination; 
verbs by a standard order. 
(3) LOGICAL. TO reduce the bulk of the concordance 
and to make the vacabdlary and context more rationally acces- 
sible: First, analyze out frequently used phrases (.e.g., 
liberum arbitrim, acceptio personarum, caelum e t  terra - 
there are about 500 of these), concordancing them under one 
word only; for example, acceptia personarum would be listed 
after all other instances of acceptio. Secondly, distinguish 
words which are either proper names or so commonly found 
that only a brief context (1% lines) need be quoted; the 
rest can then be set in a context of a lines - and the whole 
interfiled in a single series. 
These decisions have determined both the cnaraccer ana con- 
tent of Sectio 11, comprising two series (Aquinian and non-Aquin- 
ian works) of five concordances each. So much for the Cotlcordance 
proper. There remains a further instrument for the use of schol- 
ars, Sectio I. In this are included indices of diseribution, sum- 
rnarhs of the lexicon, and indLces of frequency: Through these 
lists linguistic and literary studies of all sorts can be made. 
By reverse alphabetical ordering of lemmata and forms additional 
'kinds of analysis are facilitated. Since these volumes have not 
yet appeared, they can only be briefly mentioned here. 
A massive concordance of this type must carry a concise yet: 
precise location code for each item. The editors have determined 
the proper modern edition to be used, have set a precise order of 
works to be followed In the concordancing of each type under its 
appropriate lemma, and have summarized this on a separate 4-page 
insert, to whidh the user will doubtless make frequent reference 
as he learns to use this grand instrument of research. 
A short review cannot do justice to the immense detail and 
the intelligence with which this detail has, with human and com- 
puter help, been marshalled in the I . T .  Ea'ther Busa and his 
associates are to be commended not only for their achievement, 
but: also for the example they have set for other laborers. 
Future Concordances to comparable literary corpora will obviously 
have their own special features; yet Busa's method of attacking 
problems - linguistic, philological, logical, quantitative - will 
suggest analogous modes of approach to others. While an index to 
St. Thomas by no means exhausts even the whole body of Christian 
Latlnity, it provides a key to the heart of Roman theology during 
8 9 
its period of greatest fruitfulness and to classical and patristic 
thought that passed through the schoolmen's filter. Space elso 
precludes discussion of the physical aspects of concordancing and 
printing, f o ~  which Father Busa had the assistance of IBM. 
In a work of such vast proportiohs, the care of men cannot 
obviate error. Some 53 errors have been noted by the compilers in 
Conoordantia Prima. But even the correction of at least one of 
these contains a minor error: B.O12(QDV)23 13.ag8/8 should read 
B.012(QDV)22.13.ag8/8. See Sectio 2 vol- 1, p. 526, co1.2. Also 
12.Tabula Syntagmatum, the list of phrases concordanced under only 
one member of the phrase (pp.xiv-xvi) has at least two errors: bona 
esteriora should read bona exteriora (p. xiv): drosperitas terrena 
should read prosperitas terrena (p. xvi) The most useful pentaglot 
descriptive booklet of 46pp. is somewhat marred in the English ver- 
sion by misprints and verbal infeliaities. But these small matters 
are quite eclipsed by the enormous accomplishment of Father Busa 
and his co-workers.

The processing of discourse is generally organized around 
verbs. However the structure at a topical or thematic level may 
not be so organized, bearing little resemblance to a deep struc- 
ture. Analogies are used, not only in poetry, to transfer large 
amounts of information from one domain to another; to enable com- 
munications of the otherwise. inexplicable; to make distinctions 
vivid; and to understand new concepts by analogy to old ones.

Analyzing associations in a literary text is analogous to 
the problem of computing term associations in document retrieval. 
This paper describes haw the theory of clumps was used to find 
clusters of closely associated words in the Homeric Hymns. For 
each cluster, the program printed a mini-concordance to the lines 
of text containing each word in the cluster. The results showed 
two types of patterns in the poet's use of words: localized word 
plays extendinq over a few lines, and global interactions between 
a cluster of words and the overall thematic structure of the text.
