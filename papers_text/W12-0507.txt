Abstract
This paper contrasts the content and form
of objective versus subjective texts. A col-
lection of on-line newspaper news items
serve as objective texts, while parliamen-
tary speeches (debates) and blog posts form
the basis of our subjective texts, all in
Portuguese. The aim is to provide gen-
eral linguistic patterns as used in objec-
tive written media and subjective speeches
and blog posts, to help construct domain-
independent templates for information ex-
traction and opinion mining. Our hybrid
approach combines statistical data along
with linguistic knowledge to filter out ir-
relevant patterns. As resources for subjec-
tive classification are still limited for Por-
tuguese, we use a parallel corpus and tools
developed for English to build our sub-
jective spoken corpus, through annotations
produced for English projected onto a par-
allel corpus in Portuguese. A measure for
the saliency of n-grams is used to extract
relevant linguistic patterns deemed ?objec-
tive? and ?subjective?. Perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, our contrastive approach shows that,
in Portuguese at least, subjective texts are
characterized by markers such as descrip-
tive, reactive and opinionated terms, while
objective texts are characterized mainly by
the absence of subjective markers.
1 Introduction
During the last few years there has been a growing
interest in the automatic extraction of elements re-
lated to feelings and emotions in texts, and to pro-
vide tools that can be integrated into a more global
treatment of languages and their subjective aspect.
Most research so far has focused on English, and
this is mainly due to the availability of resources
for the analysis of subjectivity in this language,
such as lexicons and manually annotated corpora.
In this paper, we contrast the subjective and the
objective aspects of language for Portuguese.
Essentially, our approach will extract linguis-
tic patterns (hopefully ?objective? for newspa-
per news items and ?subjective? for parliamen-
tary speeches and blog posts) by comparing fre-
quencies against a reference corpus. Our method
is relevant for hybrid approaches as it combines
linguistic and statistic information. Our reference
corpus, the Reference Corpus of Contemporary
Portuguese (CRPC)1, is an electronically based
linguistic corpus of around 310 million tokens,
taken by sampling from several types of written
texts (literature, newspapers, science, economics,
law, parliamentary debates, technical and didactic
documents), pertaining to national and regional
varieties of Portuguese. A random selection of
10,000 texts from the entire CRPC will be used
for our experiment. The experiment flow-chart is
shown in Figure 1. We define as objective short
news items from newspapers that reports strictly
a piece of news, without comments or analysis. A
selection of blog post items and short verbal ex-
changes between member of the European parlia-
ment will serve as subjective texts.
2 Previous work
The task of extracting linguistic patterns for data
mining is not new, albeit most research has so
far dealt with English texts. Extracting subjec-
tive patterns represents a more recent and chal-
lenging task. For example, in the Text Analy-

sis Conference (TAC 2009), it was decided to
withdraw the task of creating summaries of opin-
ions, present at TAC 2008, the organizers having
agreed on the difficulty of extracting subjective el-
ements of a text and organize them appropriately
to produce a summary. Yet, there is already some
relevant work in this area which may be men-
tioned here. For opinions, previous studies have
mainly focused in the detection and the gradation
of their emotional level, and this involves three
main subtasks. The first subtask is to distinguish
subjective from objectives texts (Yu and Hatzi-
vassiloglou, 2003). The second subtask focuses
on the classification of subjective texts into pos-
itive or negative (Turney, 2002). The third level
of refinement is trying to determine the extent to
which texts are positive or negative (Wilson et al,
2004). The momentum for this type of research
came through events such as TREC Blog Opin-
ion Task since 2006. It is also worth mention-
ing recent efforts to reintroduce language and dis-
cursive approaches (e.g. taking into account the
modality of the speaker) in this area (Asher and
Mathieu, 2008). The approaches developed for
automatic analysis of subjectivity have been used
in a wide variety of applications, such as online
monitoring of mood (Lloyd et al, 2005), the clas-
sification of opinions or comments (Pang et al,
2002) and their extraction (Hu an Liu, 2004) and
the semantic analysis of texts (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2006). In (Mihalcea et al, 2007), a bilingual
lexicon and a manually translated parallel corpus
are used to generate a sentence classifier accord-
ing to their level of subjectivity for Romanian.
Although many recent studies in the analysis of
subjectivity emphasize sentiment (a type of sub-
jectivity, positive or negative), our work focuses
on the recognition of subjectivity and objectivity
in general. As stressed in some work (Banea et
al., 2008), researchers have shown that in senti-
ment analysis, an approach in two steps is often
beneficial, in which we first distinguish objective
from subjective texts, and then classify subjective
texts depending on their polarity (Kim and Hovy,
2006). In fact, the problem of distinguishing sub-
jective versus objective texts has often been the
most difficult of the two steps. Improvements in
the first step will therefore necessarily have a ben-
eficial impact on the second, which is also shown
in some work (Takamura et al, 2006).
3 Creating a corpus of Subjective and
Objective Portuguese Texts
To build our subjective spoken corpus (more than
2,000 texts), we used a parallel corpus of English-
Portuguese speeches2 and a tool to automatically
classify sentences in English as objective or sub-
jective (OpinionFinder (Riloff et al, 2003)). We
then projected the labels obtained for the sen-
tences in English on the Portuguese sentences.
The original parallel corpus is made of 1,783,437
pairs of parallel sentences, and after removing
pervasive short sentences (e.g. ?the House ad-
journed at ...?) or pairs of sentences with the ra-
tio of their respective lengths far away from one
(a sign of alignment or translation error), we are
left with 1,153,875 pairs. A random selection of
contiguous 20k pairs is selected for the experi-
ment. The English sentences are submitted to
OpinionFinder, which labels each of them as ?un-
known?, ?subjective? or ?objective?. Opinion-
Finder has labelled 11,694 of the 20k sentences
as ?subjective?. As our experiment aims at com-
paring frequencies between texts, we have auto-
matically created segments of texts showing lex-
ical similarities using Textiling (Hearst, 1997),
leading to 2,025 texts. We haven?t made any at-
tempt to improve or evaluate OpinionFinder and
Textiling performance. This strategy is sensible
as parliamentary speeches are a series of short
opinionated interventions by members on specific
2European Parliament: http://www.statmt.org/
europarl/
47
themes. The 11,694 subjective labels have been
projected on each of the corresponding sentences
of the Portuguese corpus to produce our final spo-
ken corpus3. Note that apart from a bridge (here
a parallel corpus) between the source language
(here English) and the target language (here Por-
tuguese), our approach does not require any man-
ual annotation. Thus, given a bridge between
English and the target language, this approach
can be applied to other languages. The consid-
erable amount of work involved in the creation of
these resources for English can therefore serve as
a leverage for creating similar resources for other
languages.
We decided to include a collection of blog posts
as an additional source of subjective texts. We
gathered a corpus of 1,110 blog posts using Boot-
Cat4, a tool that allows the harvesting and clean-
ing of web pages on the basis of a set of seed
terms5.
For our treatment of objectivity and how news
are reported in Portuguese newspapers, we have
collected and cleaned a corpus of nearly 1500 ar-
ticles from over a dozen major websites (Jornal
de Not??cias, Destak, Visa?o, A Bola, etc.).
After tokenizing and POS-tagging all sen-
tences, we collected all n-grams (n = 1, 2 and
3) along with their corresponding frequency for
each corpus (reference (CRPC), objective (news
items) and subjective (parliamentary speeches and
blog posts)), each gram being a combination of
a token with its part-of-speech tag (e.g. falar V,
?speak V?). The list of POS tags is provided in
appendix A.
3As our subjective spoken corpus has been built entirely
automatically (Opinion Finder and Textiling), it is important
to note that (Ge?ne?reux and Poibeau, 2009) have verified that
such a corpus correlates well with human judgements.

5In an attempt to collect as much opinionated pages in
Portuguese as can be, we constraint BootCat to extract pages
written in Portuguese from the following web domains:
communidades.net, blogspot.com, wordpress.
com and myspace.com. We used the following seed
words, more or less strongly related to the Portuguese cul-
ture: ribatejo, camo?es, queijo, vinho, cavaco, europa, sintra,
praia, porto, fado, pasteis, bacalhau, lisboa, algarve, alen-
tejo and coelho.
4 Experiments and Results
4.1 POS and n-grams
In our experiments we have compared all the n-
grams (n = 1, 2 and 3) from the objective and
subjective texts with the n-grams from the ref-
erence corpus. This kind of analysis aims es-
sentially at the identification of salient expres-
sions (with high log-odds ratio scores). The log-
odds ratio method (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004)
compares the frequency of occurrence of each n-
gram in a specialized corpus (news, parliamen-
tary speeches or blogs) to its frequency of oc-
currence in a reference corpus (CRPC). Apply-
ing this method solely on POS, we found that
objective texts used predominantly verbs with an
emphasis on past participles (PPT/PPA, adotado,
?adopted?), which is consistent with the nature
of reported news. In general, we observed that
subjective texts have a higher number of adjec-
tives (ADJ, o?timo, ?optimum?): parliamentary
speeches also include many infinitives (INF, fe-
licitar ?congratulate?), while blogs make use of
interjections (ITJ, uau, ?wow?). Tables 1, 2 and
3 show salient expressions for each type of texts.
These expressions do not always point to a dis-
tinction between subjectivity and objectivity, but
also to topics normally associated with each type
of texts, a situation particularly acute in the case
of parliamentary speeches. Nevertheless, we can
make some very general observations. There
is no clear pattern in news items, except for a
slight tendency towards the use of a quantita-
tive terminology (?save?, ?spend?). Parliamen-
tary speeches are concerned with societal issues
(?socio-economic?, ?biodegradable?) and forms
of politeness (?wish to express/protest?). In blog
posts we find terms related to opinions (?pinch
of salt?), wishes (?I hope you enjoy?), reactions
(?oups?) and descriptions (?creamy?).
4.2 Patterns around NPs
The n-gram approach can provide interesting pat-
terns but it has its limits. In particular, it does not
allow for generalization over larger constituents.
One way to overcome this flaw is to chunk cor-
pora into noun-phrases (NP). This is the approach
taken in (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) for English. In
Riloff and Wiebe (2003), the patterns for English
involved a very detailed linguistic analysis, such
as the detection of grammatical functions as well

as active or passive forms. Without the proper re-
sources needed to produce sophisticated linguistic
annotations for Portuguese, we decided to sim-
plify matters slightly by not making distinction
of grammatical function or voice. That is, only
NPs would matter for our analysis. We used the
NP-chunker Yamcha6 trained on 1,000 manually
annotated (NPs and POS-tags) sentences. The
main idea here remains the same and is to find
a set of syntactic patterns that are relevant to each
group of texts, as we did for n-grams previously,
each NP becoming a single 1-gram for this pur-
pose. It is worth mentioning that NP-chunking
becomes particularly challenging in the case of
blogs, which are linguistically heterogeneous and
noisy. Finally, log-odds ratio once again serves
as a discriminative measure to highlight relevant
patterns around NPs. Tables 4, 5 and 6 illustrate
salient expressions from the three specialized cor-
pora, presenting some of them in context.
Although limited to relatively simple syntactic
patterns, this approach reveals a number of salient
linguistic structures for the subjective texts. In
parliamentary speeches, forms of politeness are
clearly predominant (?ladies and <NP>?, ?thank
<NP>? and ?<NP> wish to thank?). Unfortu-
nately, the patterns extracted from blog posts are

yamcha/. Our evaluation of the trained chunker on
Portuguese texts lead to an accuracy of 86% at word level.

pervaded by ?boiler-plate? material that were not
filtered out during the cleaning phase and parasite
the analysis: ?published by <NP>?, ?share on
<NP>? and ?posted by <NP>?. However, opin-
ions (?<NP> is beautiful?) and opinion primer
(?currently, <NP>?) remain present. News items
are still characterized mainly by the absence of
subjective structures (markers), albeit quantitative
expressions can still be found (?spent?).
Obviously, a statistical approach yields a cer-
tain number of irrelevant (or at best ?counter-
intuitive?) expressions: our results are no excep-
tion to this reality. Clearly, in order to reveal
insights or suggest meaningful implications, an
external (human) evaluation of the patterns pre-
sented in this study would paint a clearer picture
of the relevance of our results for information ex-
traction and opinion mining, but we think they
constitute a good starting point.

lected texts from the European Parliament, blog
posts and on-line newspapers in Portuguese. Our
work first shows that it is possible to built re-
sources for Portuguese using resources (a paral-
lel corpus) and tools (OpinionFinder) built for En-
glish. Our experiments also show that, despite our
small specialised corpora, the resources are good
enough to extract linguistic patterns that give a
broad characterization of the language in use for
reporting news items and expressing subjectivity
in Portuguese. The approach could be favourably
augmented with a more thorough cleaning phase,
a parsing phase, the inclusion of larger n-grams (n
> 3) and manual evaluation. A fully automated
daily process to collect a large-scale Portuguese
press (including editorials) and blog corpora is
currently being developed.
