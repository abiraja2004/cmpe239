Abstract 
In information extraction systems, pattern 
marchers are widely used to identi~q infof  
mat|on of interest in a scntcncc. In this 
paper, pattern matching in the Tt :XTRACT 
information extraction system is described. 
It comprises a conccpt search which |dent|- 
tics key words representing a concept, and a 
template pattern search which identifies pat- 
terns of words and phrases. TI'JXTI~,A(;T 
using thc matcher performed wcll in the 
:I'IPSTER/MUC-5 evahtation. Thc pattern 
matching architecture is also suitable \]br rapid 
system development across different domains 
of the same language. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In information extraction systems, finite- 
state pattern matchers are becoming popular 
as a means of identifying individu~d pieces of 
information in a sentence. Pattern matching 
systems for English texts are reported to be 
suits,hie tor achieving a high level of per\[br- 
mance with less effort, compared to full pars- 
ing architectures\[Hobbs et al 92\]. Among 
seventeen systems presented in the Fifth 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5), 
three systems used a pattern marcher a.s the 
main component for identifying patterns to be 
extracted \[MUC-5 93\]. A pattern matching ar- 
chitecture is appropriate for information ex- 
traction fi-om texts in narrow domains since 
identifying informatkm does not necessarily re- 
quire full understa.nding of the text. The pat- 
tern matcher can extract information of inter- 
tVisiting rese;trcher f on/ NTT Data Communica- 
tions Systems Corp., email: tkitani~.rd.nttdM.a.jp 
HNTT Data Communiclttions Systems Corp. 
est by locating speciIic expressions defined a.s 
key words and phrasal patterns obtained by 
coq)us analysis. 
This paper describes a pattern matching 
method that first identifies concepts in a seu- 
tence and then links critical pieces of informa- 
tion that map to a p~ttern. The first step in 
pattern ln~tching is a concept searvh applied 
in the TI ' ;XTRACT system of the T IPSTER 
Japanese microelectronics and corporate .joint 
ventures domains{aacobs 93a\], \[aacobs 93b\]. 
In this step, key words representing a concept 
are searched for within a sentence. The second 
step is a. template pattern sea~rh applied in the 
TEXTRACT joint ventures ystem. A com- 
plex pattern to be searched for usually con- 
sists of a few words and phrases, inste~d of just 
one word, as in the concept search. The tem- 
plate pattern search recognizes relationships 
between matched objects in the defined pat- 
tern a.s well a.s recognizing the. concept itself. 
l,'rom the viewpoints of system perfof 
mance and portalfility across domains, the 
TIPS'I.'I~;II/MUC-5 evaluatioll J'esults suggest 
that pattern nta.tching described in this paper 
is all appropriate architecture for information 
extraction from ,lapanese texts. 
2 TIPSTER/MUC-5 OVERVIEW 
The goal of the TI1)STER/MUC-5 project 
sponsored by ARPA is to capture informa- 
tion of interest from English and .lal)aJmse 
newspal)er artMes about microelectronics and 
corpora.re joint ventures. 1 A system must

fronl the text its. a fully automated fa.sh- 
ion. The template is composed of several 
objects, each containing severM slots. Slots 
may have pointers as va.lues, where pointers 
link related ot)jects. Extracted information 
is expected to be stored in an object-oriented 
database \[TIPSTER 92\]. 
In the microelectronics domain, information 
about four specific processes in seiniconduc- 
tot manufacturing for microchip fabrication 
is captured. They are layering, lithography, 
etching, aaM packaging processes. \],ayering, 
lithography, and etching a.re wafer fa.brical:ion 
processes; packaging is part of tile last stage of 
manufacturing. Entities such as manufactu rer, 
distributor, and user, in addition to detailed 
manufacturing information such a.s materials 
used and the microchip specifications such as 
wafer size and device speed are also extra.cted 
in each process. 
The joint ventures domain focuses on ex 
tracting entities, i.e. organizations, forming 
or dissolving joint venture relationshil)s. The 
information to l)e extracted includes entity in- 
formation such as location, na.tionality, per- 
sonnel, and facilities, and joint venture infor- 
mation such as rela.tionshii)s, 1)usiness a.ctivi- 
ties, capital, and estimated revenue of the joint 
ventttre. 
3 TEXTRACT ARCHITECTURE 
TEXTI /ACT is an informati(m extraction 
system developed as an optiona.l system of 
the GE-CMU SHOGUN system \[Jacobs 93a\], 
\[aacobs93b\]. it processes the TIPSTFI{. 
Japanese domains of microelectronics and co l  
porate joint ventures. The :I'I';XTllA(VI ~ mi- 
croelectronics system comprises three major 
components: prel)rocessing ~ conceltt search, 
and template generatiol|. In ad(lition to (:on. 
celtt search, the "FI!;XrI'IIACT joint ventures 
system perfbrms a templ~te pattern search. \[t 
is also equipped with a discourse processor, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
In the preprocessor, Japanese text is seg- 
mented into primitive: words tagged with their 
t)arts of speech by a Japanese segmentor 
called MAJESTY\[Kitani and Mitamura 93\], 
\[Kitani 91\]. Then, proper norms, along with 
monetary, nulneric, and temporal expressions

The con(;ept search and template pattern

ognizes relationshil)s within the identified in- 
f'ornuttion in the matched pattern. Details of 
the l)attern matching process are described in 
the next section. 
The discourse processor links information 
identified a.t different stages o\[" processing. 
l"irst, implicit subjects, often use<\[ in Japanese 
sentences, are inherited fronl previous sen- 
tences, and set'oil(l, company ltatlles are givell 
iltliqlte ltunlbers necessary to accurately rec- 
ogMze company relationships throughout ile 
text\[Kitani 94\]. Concepts identified during 
tile pattern matching process are used to se- 
lect an approt)ria.te string and filler' to go into ~ 
slot. \]?inally, l.he template generation pro(:ess 
assembles the extracted information necessary 
to creat(.~ the OUtl)nl; descril)ed in Secl, iou 2.

4 PATTERN MATCHING IN 
TEXTRACT 
4.1 Concept search 
Key words representing the same concept 
are grouped into a list and used to recognize 
the concept in a sentence. The list is written in 
a simple format: (concept-name wordl word2 
...). For example, key words tbr recognizing a
dissolved joint vent u re con cept can be written 
in the following way: 
(DISSOLVED ~-~j~-~ ~-.~: ~) 
or 
(DISSOLVED dissolve terminate cancel). 
The concept search module recognizes the con- 
cept when a word in the fist exists in tile sen- 
tence. Using such a simple word list some- 
tilnes generates an incorrect concept. For ex- 
ample, a dissolved concept is erroneously iden- 
tiffed fl'om an expression "cancel a hotel reser- 
vation". IIowever, when processing text in a. 
narrow <lomain, concepts are often i<lentiffe<t 
correctly fi'om the simple list, since key words 
are usually used in a particular meaning of in- 
terest in the domain. 
During the Ja.panese segmentation process 
in the preprocessor, a key word in the text 
tends to be divided into a few separate words 
by MAJESTY, when the word is not stored 
in the dictionary, For example, the compound 
noun "~ j J '~f~"  consists of two words, " i~3 '' 
(joint venture) and ":r#~b1" (dissolve). It is seg- 
mented into the two individual nouns using the 
current MAJESTY dictionary. Thus, when 
the compound word "~.-~jlf(t'-fb\] '' is searched for 
in the segmented sentence, the concept search 
fails to identify it. To avoid this segmentation 
problein, adjacent nouns are automatical ly put 
together during the concept search process. 
This process al\]ows, by defanlt, partial word 
matching between a key word and a word in 
the text. Therefore, "~.-~j" and "~05 {~J"  
both meaning "a .joint venture" can be identi- 
tied by a single key word "~.'I~,Y'. Ilowever, 
due to the nature of partial matching, the 
key word "-.:/~ = :/" (Silicon) matches "-iL~. 
4\[:: "5+ ~ = :/" (Silicon dioxide), which is a dif- 
ferent type of ffhn reported in the microelec- 
tronies domain. This undesirable behavior can 
be avoided by attaching ">" to the begin- 
ning or "<" to the end of key words. Thus, 
,,> .3.1) :~ :/ <,, tells the matcher that it re- 
quires an exact word matching against a word 
in the text. 
4.2 Template pattern search 
4.2.1 Template pattern matcher 
The teml>late pattern matcher identifies 
typical expressions to be extracted from the 
text that frequently aplmar in the corpus. The 
patterns are defined as pa.ttern matching rules 
using regular expressions. 
The pattern matcher is a ffnite-state au- 
tomaton sinfilar to the pattern recognizer use.d 
in the MUC-4 FASTUS system developed at 
SRI \[I\[obbs et al 92\]. /n TEXTRACT,  state 
transitions arc driven by segmented words or 
grouped units fi'om the prei)rocessor. The 
matcher identifies all possible patterns of in- 
terest in the. text that match defined l>atterns. 
It must ignore unnecessary words in the pat- 
tern to perform successfifl pattern matching 
for various expressions. 
4.2.2 Pattern matching rules 
Fig. 2 shows a defined pattern in 
which an arhitrary string is represented 
as "g~string" along with its correspond- 
ing English pattern. 2 Specilica.lly, a vari- 
able starting with "@CNAMI:;" is ca.lled the 
COulpally-name varial)le, used where a com- 
pany nanm is exi)ected to apl)ear. For exain- 
pie, "{}CNAME_I'AI{TNER_SUBJ" matches 
any string that likely includes at least; one com- 
pany name acting a.s a joint venture partner 
and functioning as a subject in tile sentence. 
The pattern "~ I h{:stri(:t:P" tells the pat- 
tern matcher to identify the word, where 
"~"  or "z)<" are grammatical  particles that 
serve as sul)je(-t case markers. The (te- 
fault type "strict" requires a.n exact string 
match, whereas "loose" allows a partial string 
match. Partial string matching is useful 
when compound words must be matched to 
a defined pattern. A joint venture, "~.-~j: 
loose:VN", whose l>art of speech is verbal nom- 
inal, matches compound words such as "~..~ 
~'~--~j" (corporate joint venture) a.s well ,%s "N 
~,j" (joint venture). 
2'\]'his \],'mglish pattern is used to capture xpressions 
such as "XYZ Corp. created ajoint venture with PQR

for English in this case). 
4.2 .3  Pat tern  se lect ion  
Approxiiila.tely 150 pa.tterns were used to 
extract various concepts in the Japanese joint 
ventures domain. Several patterns usually 
tllatch a. single sentence. Moreover, siuce pal;- 
terns are often searched using case ma.rkers 
slic\]i as "~" ,  "7~<", and " ~ ", which frequently 
apt)ea.r ill .\]al)a.nese t xts, even a sitigie l)a.t -

gtmerator aCCellts only the best lnat(;he(I pal;-

imlJortant. The selection in (lone by applying

? select patterns that include the lnost 
l l l i i i i l)er of variables and defined words. 
Another important feature of the pa.t:tern 
Iilat(:hor is tha,t rules can be groupe(1 accord- 
ilig to their COilCel)t. A rule lla.iile "JohltVeli- 
turel" iii Fig. 2, for example, represents a
concel)t " JointVel it l l re' .  Ushlg this group- 
big, the best nlatched pattern can be selected 
fl'on-i nlatched patterns of a particular concept 
group instea.d of choosing from all the matched 
patterns. This feature enables the discourse 
and template g(meration processes to look at 
the, best infortnation ecessary whet, tilling in 
a particular slot. 
5 EXAMPLE OF  THE INFORMA-  
T ION EXTRACTION PROCESS 
This sectkm describes how concepts ~tnd 
patterns identifh;d by tile matcher are used for 
tenll)late filling. Concepts are often useful to 
fill in the "set fill" (choice fi'om a. given set) 
sh)ts. An entity type slot, for examl)le , ha,s 
four giw, i choices: COMPANY, I)EI{SON, 
GOVERNM/i;NT, ~tnd OTIIt{;R. The matcher 
assigns concepts related to each entity type ex- 
cept ()Tf lEIL Thus, from the given set, the 
output generator chooses an entity type corre- 
sponding to the identified concept. There axe 
ca.ses when discourse processing is necessa.ry 
to link identified concepts and patterns. The 
f.ollowing text;: "X Inc. created a joint w;ntm'e 
with Y Corp. last yea.r. X announced yester- 
day that it. terminated the venture." in used 
to describe the extraction process il lustrated 
in Fig. 3. 
In the preprocessing, two company na.tnes in 
the first sentence "X hic." and "Y Corp." are 
identified either I)y MAJESTY or the name 
recognizer. In the first sentence, the tem- 
pla.te pa.tteru search locates the ,I ointgenture 1 
pattern shown in Fig. 2. Now, the ,/OINT- 
V I';NT \[J 1{1'3 con cepl; I)etweeii "X inc." and "Y 
C'ol'l)." is recognized. In tim second Sellt(~.it(X~., 
7067 
"X Inc. created a "X announced 
joint venture with yesterday that it 
Y Corp. last year."i terminated the 
venture."

Fig. 3: FxamI)le of the inforntatiou extraction 
process 
the company name "X" is also identitied by 
the preprocessor, a Next, the concept "DIS- 
SOLVEi)" is recognized by the key word ter- 
minate in the concept search. (The key word 
list is shown in Section 4.11.) After sentence- 
level processing, discourse processing recog- 
nizes that "X" in the second sentence is a ref- 
erence to "X Inc." found in the first sentence. 
Thus, the "DISSOLVI';I)" concept is joined to 
the, joint venture relationship between "X inc." 
and "Y Corp.". in this way, TI!iXTRACT rec- 
ognizes that the two companies dissolved the 
,joint venture. 
SupI)ose that the second sentence is re- 
place(t with another sentence: "Shortly after, 
X terminated a contract to supply rice to Z 
Corp.". Although it does not mentiot~ the 
dissolved relationship nor anything a hottt "Y 
Corp.", the system incorrectly recognizes the 
dissolved joint ventttre rela.tionship between 
"X In('." and "V Corp." due to the existence 
of the word terminate.  When this undesir- 
able matching is often seen, more complicated 
template patterns must be used instead of tile 
simple word list. A dissolved concept, lbr ex- 
ample, could he identified using the fo\]\[owing 
template pattern: 
aWhen it is an unknown word to tim prepro(x~ssor, 
the discourse processor idcnti\[ies it IM.er. 
(Dissolvedl 2

@skip 
venture::N 
@CNAME_PARTNER_WITH). 
Then, discourse processing must check if com+ 
panies identified in this pattern are the same 
as the current joint venture comi)anies in order 
to recognize their dissolved relationship. 
6 OVERALL  SYSTEM PERFOR-  
MANCE 
A total of 250 newspaper articles, 100 
about Japanese mi('roelectronics and 150 
about Japanese corl)orate joint ventures 
were provided by ARI)A fl)r nse in the 
Tll)SrI'FA/./MU(L5 system evalua.tion. Five 
microelectronics and six joint ventures sys- 
tems were presented in the Japanese, system

was necessa.ry, analysts instructed the scof

an overall score combined from all the news-

Japanese. It is expected to work to other lan- 
guages with some minor modifications given 
that the input is segmented into primitive 
words tagged with their parts of speech. 
The TEXTRACT Japanese microelectron- 
ics system was developed in only three weeks 
by one person. In spite of its simplicity, it 
showed the high performance. This result 
also suggests that the pattern matching archi- 
tecture is highly portable across similar do- 
mains of the same la.nguage, thus facilitating 
rapid system development. Developing and 
maintaining TEXTRACT's pattern matching 
based architecture is easier and less complex 
than that of a full parsing system, as experi- 
enced in the early stage of StIOGUN system 
development \[aacobs 93b\]. 
Corpus analysis took about half of the de- 
velopment ime, since only a KWIC (Key 
Word In Context) list and a word fi'equency 
tool were used to acquire the concept-word 
lists and the template patterns. Using good 
statistical corpus analysis tools will shorten 
the development time and promise a high per- 
formance. The tools should not only collect 
patterns of interest with context, but also give 
statistical data to show how well deft ned pat- 
terns are working when they are applied in the 
system. 
At MUC-5 meeting, P&R F-measure of one 
of the top-ranking systems was claimed to be 
close to the human perfornlance \[Jacobs 93b\]. r 
To match the system performance of a pattern 
matching system to human performallce, the 
preprocessor must recognize xpressions to be 
extracted at nearly 100% accuracy given that 
other components imply merge information 
and generate ontput.
