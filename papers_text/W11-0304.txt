Abstract
While many computational models have been
created to explore how children might learn
to segment words, the focus has largely been
on achieving higher levels of performance and
exploring cues suggested by artificial learning
experiments. We propose a broader focus that
includes designing models that display prop-
erties of infants? performance as they begin
to segment words. We develop an efficient
bootstrapping online learner with this focus in
mind, and evaluate it on child-directed speech.
In addition to attaining a high level of perfor-
mance, this model predicts the error patterns
seen in infants learning to segment words.
1 Introduction
The last fifteen years have seen an increased inter-
est in the problem of how infants learn to segment
a continuous stream of speech into words. Much of
this work has been inspired by experiments with in-
fants focusing on what capabilities infants have and
which cues they attend to. While experimental work
provides insight into the types of cues infants may be
using, computational modeling of the task provides
a unique opportunity to test proposed cues on rep-
resentative data and validate potential approaches to
using them.
While there are many potential approaches to the
problem, a desirable solution to the problem should
demonstrate acceptable performance in a simula-
tion of the task, rely on cues in the input that an
infant learner is able to detect at the relevant age,
and exhibit learning patterns similar to those of in-
fant learners. Most work in computational model-
ing of language acquisition has primarily focused
on achieving acceptable performance using a sin-
gle cue, transitional probabilities, but little effort has
been made in that work to try to connect these learn-
ing solutions to the actual learning patterns observed
in children outside of performance on short artificial
language learning experiments.
In this work we present a simple, easily extended
algorithm for unsupervised word segmentation that,
in addition to achieving a high level of performance
in the task, correlates with the developmental pat-
terns observed in infants. We discuss the connec-
tions between the design and behavior of our algo-
rithm and the cognitive capabilities of infants at the
age at which they appear to begin segmenting words.
We also discuss how our technique can easily be ex-
tended to accept additional cues to word segmenta-
tion beyond those implemented in our learner.
2 Related Work
As this paper examines the intersection of infants?
capabilities and computational modeling, we discuss
work in both domains, beginning with experimental
approaches to understanding how infants may per-
form the task of word segmentation.
2.1 Infant Word Segmentation
A potential account of how infants learn to iden-
tify words in fluent speech is that they learn words
in isolation and then use those words to segment
longer utterances (Peters, 1983; Pinker et al, 1984).
It is not clear, however, that infant-directed speech
provides enough detectable words in isolation for
29
such a strategy (Aslin et al, 1996). Whatever iso-
lated words children do hear, they appear to attend to
them; whether a word is heard in isolation is a better
predictor of whether a child has learned a word than
the word?s frequency (Brent and Siskind, 2001).
A more plausible alternative account to assume
children attend to patterns in the input, using them to
identify likely word units. Much experimental work
has followed from the finding that in artificial learn-
ing tasks, infants and adults appear to prefer word-
like units that match statistical patterns in the input
(Saffran et al, 1996b; Saffran et al, 1996a). Saffran
et al and the authors of following studies (Aslin et
al., 1998; Saffran, 2001, among many others) sug-
gest that participants used transitional probabilities
to succeed in these experiments, but the actual strat-
egy used is unclear and may even be an artifact of
the perceptual system (Perruchet and Vinter, 1998;
Hewlett and Cohen, 2009).
More recent work using real language data has
not shown transitional probabilities to be as useful
a cue as originally suggested. Lew-Williams et al
(2011) found that 9-month-old English-learning in-
fants were not able to learn high-transitional prob-
ability words in fluent Italian speech unless those
words were also presented in isolation. Given this
finding and the extensive exisiting modeling work
focusing on the used of transitional probabilities, we
believe it is crucial to additionally explore segmen-
tation strategies that rely on other cues in the input.
2.2 Modeling Word Segmentation
While experimental work has posited simple algo-
rithms that infants might use to accomplish the task
of word segmentation, when applied to real language
data these techniques have yielded very poor results
(Yang, 2004). This problem has created a chal-
lenge for researchers modeling language acquisition
to suggest more sophisticated strategies that infants
might use. These approaches have fallen into two
primary categories: optimization-based and boot-
strapping algorithm strategies.
Optimization-based strategies have focused on
techniques that a learner might use to arrive at an
optimal segmentation, either through a dynamic pro-
gramming approach (Brent, 1999), online learning
(Venkataraman, 2001), or nonparametric Bayesian
inference (Goldwater et al, 2009; Johnson and
Goldwater, 2009). These approaches fit within stan-
dard statistical approaches to natural language pro-
cessing, defining statistical objectives and inference
strategies, with the learners trying to optimize some
combination of the quality of its lexicon and repre-
sentations of the corpus.
In contrast, bootstrapping approaches (Gambell
and Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010) to word
segmentation have focused on simple heuristics for
populating a lexicon and strategies for using the con-
tents of the lexicon to segment utterances. These ap-
proaches have focused on a procedure for segmen-
tation rather than defining an optimal segmentation
explicitly, and do not define a formal objective that
is to be optimized.
While bootstrapping approaches have generally
made stronger attempts to align with infants abili-
ties to process the speech signal (Gambell and Yang,
2004) than other approaches, little effort has been
made to connect the details of an implemented seg-
mentation strategy with children?s learning patterns
since the earliest computational models of the task
(Olivier, 1968). It is important to draw a con-
trast here between attempts to match patterns of hu-
man development with regard to word segmentation
with attempts to model performance in artificial lan-
guage learning experiments whose goal is to probe
word segmentation abilities in humans (Frank et al,
2010). In this paper we are focused on matching the
progression of development and performance in nat-
uralistic experiments to characteristics of a segmen-
tation strategy, an approach similar to that employed
in English past tense learning (Rumelhart and Mc-
Clelland, 1986; Pinker, 2000; Yang, 2002).
We will now discuss the patterns of development
for children learning to segment English words,
which form the motivation for the design of our seg-
menter.
3 Infant Performance in Word
Segmentation
While the developmental patterns of English-
learning infants have been broadly studied, it has
been difficult to identify errors that must be caused
by failures to correctly segment words and not other
cognitive limitations, issues of morphological pro-
ductivity, or syntactic competency issues.
30
Brown (1973) offers one of the most compre-
hensive examinations of the types of errors that
young infants make regarding word segmentation.
He notes that Adam?s common errors included treat-
ing it?s-a, that-a, get-a, put-a, want-to, and at-that
as single words, as judged by various misproduc-
tions that involved these items. A possible analysis
of these errors is that in addition to the high level of
frequency with which those syllables co-occur, ele-
ments such as a and to do not carry any identifiable
amount of stress in natural speech.
In addition to the undersegmentations that Brown
identifies, Peters (1983) identifies the pattern of
oversegmenting function words begin other words,
including this famous dialog between a parent and
child, where in the child?s response have is pro-
nounced in the same way as the second syllable of
behave: Parent: Behave! Child: I am have!
The response by the child indicates that they have
analyzed behave as be have. There are two major
factors that could contribute to such an analysis: the
high frequency of be leading to it being treated as a
separate word (Saffran et al, 1996b), and the lack of
stress on be but stress on have which forms a word
contrary to the dominant pattern of stress in English
(Cutler and Butterfield, 1992).
Infants appear to use the ends of utterances to aid
segmentation, and as early at 7.5 months old they
are able to recognize novel words in fluent speech if
the novel words are presented at the ends of an utter-
ance and not utterance medially (Seidl and Johnson,
2006). Thus the reliable boundaries presented by the
edge of an utterance should be treated as informative
for a learner.
Most crucially, the syllable seems to be the unit
children use to form words. Experiments that have
been performed to gauge adult and infant compe-
tency in word segmentation have been designed with
the assumption that the only possible segmentation
points are at syllable boundaries. That infants should
be able to operate on syllables is unsurprising; in-
fants as young as 4-days-old are able to discrimi-
nate words based on syllable length (Bijeljac-Babic
et al, 1993) and phonotactic cues to syllable bound-
aries seem to be rapidly acquired by infants (On-
ishi et al, 2002). The use of the syllable in exper-
imental work on word segmentation stands in con-
trast to many computational models that have oper-
ated at the phoneme level (Brent, 1999; Venkatara-
man, 2001; Goldwater et al, 2009). An exception
to the focus on phoneme-based segmentation is the
joint learning model proposed by Johnson (2008)
that learns syllabification and other levels of repre-
sentation jointly with word segmentation, but that
model poses problems as a developmentally relevant
approach in that it predicts unattested joint syllabifi-
cation/segmentation errors by infants and problems
as a linguistically relevant approach due to its non-
phonotactic approach to learning syllabification.
From this survey, we see some relevant phenom-
ena that a good model of infant word segmentation
should replicate. (1) The learner should operate on
syllables. (2) At some stage of learning, underseg-
mentation function word collocations (e.g., that-a
should occur. (3) At some stage of learning, over-
segmentation of function words that may begin other
words (e.g., be-have) should occur. (4) The learner
should attend to the ends of utterances as use them
to help identify novel words.
4 An Algorithm for Segmentation
The algorithm we propose is similar in style to previ-
ous online bootstrapping segmenters (Gambell and
Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010) but varies in a
few crucial aspects. First, it inserts word boundaries
in a left-to-right fashion as it processes each utter-
ance (i.e., in temporal order), unlike previous mod-
els which have worked from the outside in. Second,
it can handle cases where the segmentation is am-
biguous given the current lexicon and score multiple
possible segmentations. Finally, the use of word-
level stress information is an optional part of the
model, and not an essential part of the segmenta-
tion process. This allows us to examine the addi-
tional power that stress provides on top of a sub-
tractive segmentation system and allows the model
to generalize to languages where word-level stress
is not present in the same fashion as English (e.g.,
French). We first discuss the individual operations
the algorithm uses to segment an utterance, and then
discuss how they are combined in the segmenter.
4.1 The Lexicon
The learner we propose will primarily use items in
its lexicon to help identify new possible words. The
31
structure of the lexicon is as follows:
Lexicon. The lexicon contains the phonological ma-
terial of each word that the learner has previously
hypothesized. The lexicon stores a score along with
each word, which the segmenter may increment or
decrement.
The score assigned to each entry in the lexicon
represents the relative confidence that it is a true
word of the language. Each increment simply adds
to the score of an individual word and each decre-
ment subtracts from it.
4.2 Subtractive Segmentation
Subtractive segmentation is the process of using
known words to segment the speech signal, which
infants appear to be able to do as young as at six
months of age (Bortfeld et al, 2005).
Subtractive Segmentation. When possible, remove
a known word in the lexicon from the front of the
utterance being segmented.
One way to apply subtractive segmentation is a
greedy score-based heuristic for subtractive segmen-
tation (Lignos and Yang, 2010), such that whenever
multiple words in the lexicon could be subtracted
from an utterance, the entry with the highest score
will deterministically be used. This greedy approach
results in a ?rich get richer? effect of the sort seen in
Dirichlet processes (Goldwater et al, 2009). We will
first discuss this approach and then later extend this
greedy search to a beam search.
Figure 1 gives the implementation of subtractive
segmentation in our algorithm. This algorithm re-
sults in the following properties:
Initially, utterances are treated as words in isola-
tion. When the lexicon is empty, no word bound-
aries will be inserted and the full contents of each
utterance will be added to the lexicon as a word.
High-frequency words are preferred. When pre-
sented with a choice of multiple words to subtract,
the highest scored word will be subtracted, which
will prefer higher frequency words over lower fre-
quency words in segmentation.
Syllables between words are not necessarily con-
sidered words. Syllables that occur between sub-
tractions are not added as words in the lexicon. For
example, if play and please are in the lexicon but
checkers is not, the utterance play checkers please
will be correctly segmented, but checkers will not
be added to the lexicon. Much like infants appear
to do, the learner does not place as much weight on
less reliable boundaries hypothesized in the middle
of an utterance (Seidl and Johnson, 2006).
4.3 Incorporating Stress Information
A particularly useful constraint for defining a word,
introduced to the problem of word segmentation by
Yang (2004) but previously discussed by Halle and
Vergnaud (1987), is as follows:
Unique Stress Constraint (USC): A word can bear
at most one primary stress.
Yang (2004) evaluated the effectiveness of the
USC in conjunction with a simple approach to us-
ing transitional probabilities, showing significant
performance improvements. The availability of
such stress cues is not, however, an uncontroversial
assumption; there are no language-universal cues
to stress and even within a single language auto-
matic detection of word-level stress is still unreli-
able (Van Kuijk and Boves, 1999), making auto-
matic capture of such data for simulation purposes
difficult.
Before taking advantage of word-level stress in-
formation, the infant learner would need to iden-
tify the acoustic correlates to word-level stress in her
language, and we will not address the specific mech-
anisms that an infant learner may use to accomplish
the task of identifying word-level stress in this paper.
Based on strong experimental evidence that infants
discriminate between weakly and strongly stressed
syllables and use it to group syllables into word-like
units (Jusczyk et al, 1999), we assume that an infant
may attend to this cue and we evaluate our model
with and without it.
We adopt the USC for segmentation in the follow-
ing fashion:
Unique Stress Segmentation (USS). Insert word
boundaries such that no word contains two strong
stresses. Do so in a lazy fashion, inserting bound-
aries as a last resort just before adding another syl-
lable to the current would cause it to contain two
strong stresses.

end while
w ? the syllables between the last boundary inserted (or the beginning of the utterance if no boundaries were inserted) and the
end of the utterance
Increment w?s score in the lexicon, adding it to the lexicon if needed
Figure 2: A Unique Stress Segmentation Algorithm
This strategy is expressed in an algorithmic form
in Figure 2. The learner uses USS as a last resort
to prevent creating a segmentation with an impossi-
ble amount of stress in a single word. For example
consider an unsegmented English utterance with the
stressed syllables underlined: Givemetheball. Ap-
plying USS would create the following segmenta-
tion: Givemethe ball.
A USS-based algorithm would note the stress on
the first syllable, then keep scanning until another
stress is located on the fourth syllable, inserting a
break between the two. Givemethe and ball would
be added to the lexicon. While this is not a per-
fect segmentation, it can be used to aid subtractive
segmentation by seeding the lexicon, even if not all
entries added to the lexicon are not correct.
4.4 Combining Subtraction and Stress
Information
Given our bootstrapping methodology, it is highly
desirable to be able to integrate USS along with sub-
tractive segmentation. An algorithm that combines
both is shown in Figure 3.
4.5 Extending to Beam Search
The greedy segmentation proposed is limited in its
ability to find a good segmentation by its reliance on
local decisions. A frequent undersegmentation error
of the greedy segmenter is of this type: partof an
apple. Because partof has a higher score than part
at the point in learning where this utterance is en-
countered, the greedy segmenter will always choose
partof.
An alternative approach is to let the segmenter

if USS requires a word boundary then
Insert a word boundary and advance i, updating the lexicon as needed

Subtract the highest scoring word and advance i, updating the lexicon as needed

Advance i by one syllable

end of the utterance

Figure 3: An algorithm combining USS and Subtractive Segmentation
explore multiple hypotheses at once, using a sim-
ple beam search. New hypotheses are added to
support multiple possible subtractive segmentations.
For example, using the utterance above, at the be-
ginning of segmentation either part or partof could
be subtracted from the utterance, and both possi-
ble segmentations can be evaluated. The learner
scores these hypotheses in a fashion similar to the
greedy segmentation, but using a function based on
the score of all words used in the utterance. The
geometric mean has been used in compound split-
ting (Koehn and Knight, 2003), a task in many ways
similar to word segmentation, so we adopt it as the
criterion for selecting the best hypothesis. For a
hypothesized segmentation H comprised of words
wi . . . wn, a hypothesis is chosen as follows:
argmax
H
(
?
wi?H
score(wi))
1
n
For any w not found in the lexicon we must assign
a score; we assign it a score of one as that would
be its value assuming it had just been added to the
lexicon, an approach similar to Laplace smoothing.
Returning to the previous example, while the
score of partof is greater than that of part, the score
of of is much higher than either, so if both partof
an apple and part of an apple are considered, the
high score of of causes the latter to be chosen.
When beam search is employed, only words used in
the winning hypothesis are rewarded, similar to the
greedy case where there are no other hypotheses.
In addition to preferring segmentations that use
words of higher score, it is useful to reduce the

ting the beam size to be two, forcing each hypothesis
to develop greedily after an ambiguous subtraction
causes two hypotheses to form, we are guaranteed
a unique word to penalize. In the previous example
partof causes the split between the two hypotheses
in the beam, and thus the learner penalizes it to dis-
courage using it in the future.
5 Results
5.1 Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of our model, we mea-
sured performance on child-directed speech, using
the same corpus used in a number of previous stud-
ies that used syllabified input (Yang, 2004; Gambell
and Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010). The eval-
34
uation set was comprised of adult utterances from
the Brown (1973) data of the CHILDES database
(MacWhinney, 2000).1 Phonemic transcriptions of
words from the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dic-
tionary (CMUdict) Version 0.7 (Weide, 1998), us-
ing the first pronunciation for each word and mark-
ing syllables with level 1 stress as strong syllables.
The corpus was syllabified using onset maximiza-
tion. Any utterance in which a word could not be
transcribed using CMUDICT was excluded, leaving
55,840 utterances. We applied a probabilistic re-
call function to the lexicon to simulate the fact that
a child learner will not perfectly recall all hypothe-
sized words either due to memory limitations, vari-
ability in the input, or any other possible source of
failure. We used the same function and constant as
used by Lignos and Yang (2010).
To adjust the word-level stress information to bet-
ter reflect natural speech, the stress information ob-
tained from CMUdict was post-processed in the con-
text of each utterance using the technique of Lig-
nos and Yang (2010). For any n adjacent primary-
stress syllables, only the nth syllable retains primary
stress; all others are made into weak syllables. This
reflects the fact that stress clash is avoided in English
and that infants may not reliably detect acoustic cor-
relates of stress in the input.
In addition to variations of our algorithm, we eval-
uated a baseline segmenter which marks every syl-
lable boundary as a word boundary, treating each
syllable as a word. We tested five variants of our
algorithm, adding combinations of USS, subtractive
segmentation, and adding beam search with a beam
size of two2 to subtractive segmentation.
Precision and recall metrics were calculated over
all word boundaries over all utterances in the cor-
pus. The segmenter?s task is effectively to classify
each syllable boundary as a word boundary or not.
As single-syllable utterances are unambiguously a
single word with no possible boundaries, they are
1A separate set of previous studies have used a corpus se-
lected by Brent (1999) for evaluation. Due to length limitations
and the fact that the results presented here cannot be meaning-
fully compared to those studies, we only present results on the
Brown (1973) data here.

because they do not straightforwardly allow for penalization,
we do not report results for larger beam sizes.
excluded from evaluation but still given as input.
Evaluation was performed by giving each algo-
rithm a single pass over the data set, with the perfor-
mance on every utterance included in the total score.
This is the most challenging metric for an online
segmenter, as early mistakes made when the learner
has been exposed to no data still count against it.
5.2 Performance
The performance of several variations of our algo-
rithm is given in Table 1. The most surprising re-
sult is the high performance provided by the sylla-
ble baseline. This good performance is both an arti-
fact of English and the metrics used to evaluate the
segmenters. In English, there are larger number of
monosyllabic words than in other languages, result-
ing in high precision in addition to the guaranteed
100% recall because it predicts every possible word
boundary. The standard metric of evaluating pre-
cision and recall over word boundaries rather than
words identified in each utterance also contributes
to this performance; when this baseline is evaluated
with a word-level precision and recall it does not
perform as well (Lignos and Yang, 2010).
Subtractive Segmentation provides an improve-
ment in utterance evaluation over the Syllable Base-
line, and adding beam search to it slightly improves
F-score, sacrificing precision for recall. This is to be
expected from the penalization step in beam search;
as the penalization penalizes some good words in ad-
dition to undesirable ones, the purification of the ut-
terance segmentation and the lexicon comes at the
cost of recall from over-penalization.
While USS alone is clearly not a sufficiently rich
segmentation technique, it is important to note that
it is a high precision indicator of word boundaries,
suggesting that stress information can be useful to
the learner even when used in this simple way. More
importantly, USS contributes unique information to
subtractive segmentation, as the utterance F-score
of subtractive segmentation improves from 90.37 to
92.88.
While the performance numbers show that the
segmenter performs competently at the task, the
more significant question at hand is whether the er-
rors committed by the learner match developmental
patterns of infants. As the design of the segmenter
predicts, the main error types of the Subtractive Seg-
35
mentation + USS algorithm fall into two classes:
Function word collocations. For example, the
third highest-scored non-word in the lexicon is
that?sa, congruent with observations of function
word collocations seen in children (Brown, 1973).
Oversegmentation of function words. The
greedy approach used for segmenting the words
of highest score results in function words being
aggressively segmented off the front of words, for
example a nother. The highest scored non-word in
the lexicon is nother as a result.
Adding beam search reduces the number of func-
tion word collocations in the segmenter?s output; the
learner?s most commonly penalized lexicon entry is
isthat. However, beam search also penalizes a lot of
words, such as another. Thus the strategy used in
beam search predicts an early use of function word
collocations, followed by later oversegmentation.
6 Discussion
In the discussion of related work, we identified two
major paradigms in modeling word segmentation:
optimization and bootstrapping approaches. The al-
gorithm presented here combines elements of both.
Its behavior over time and across utterances is that of
a bootstrapping learner, but when processing each
utterance it selects a segmentation based on a sim-
ple, cognitively plausible beam search.
By using a beam search of the kind suggested, it
is easy to see how a variety of other cues could be
integrated into the learning process. We have given a
simple function for selecting the best hypothesis that
only relies on lexicon scores, but more sophisticated
functions could take multiple cues into account. For
example it has been observed that 7-month-olds at-
tend more to distributional cues while 9-month-olds
attend more to stress cues (Thiessen and Saffran,
2003). A learner in which the weight placed on
stress cues increases as the learner receives more
data would match this pattern. Other research has
suggested a more complex hierarchy of cues (Mat-
tys et al, 2005), but how the weighting of the vari-
ous cues can be adjusted with more input remains an
open question.
A crucial frontier in word segmentation is the ex-
pansion of evaluation to include other languages. As
with many other tasks, creating solutions that per-
form well in a broad variety of languages is im-
portant but has not yet been pursued. Future work
should attempt to match developmental patterns in
other languages, which will require adding morpho-
logical complexity to the system; the techniques
developed for English are unlikely to succeed un-
changed in other languages.
Comparing with other algorithms? published re-
sults is difficult because of varying choices of data
sets and metrics. For example, other syllable-based
algorithms have evaluated their performance using
word-level, as opposed to boundary-level, precision
and recall (Gambell and Yang, 2004; Lignos and
Yang, 2010). We have adopted the more popular
boundary-based metric here, but there is no way to
directly compare with work that does not use syllab-
ified input. The variety of possible evaluation met-
rics obviates the need for a longer-form exploration
of how existing approaches perform when evaluated
against varying metrics. Additionally, a more stan-
dard set of evaluation data in many languages would
greatly improve the ability to compare different ap-
proaches to this task.
7 Conclusion
The work presented here represents a step toward
bringing together developmental knowledge regard-
ing word segmentation and computational model-
ing. Rather than focusing on cues in artificial learn-
ing experiments which may or may not generalize
to the natural development of word segmentation in
children, we have shown how a simple algorithm
for segmentation mimics many of the patterns seen
in infants? developing competence. We believe this
work opens the door to a promising line of research
that will make a stronger effort to see simulations
of language acquisition as not just an unsupervised
learning task but rather a modeling task that must
take into account a broad variety of phenomena.
