In Section 6 of "A statistical approach to machine translation" (Computational Linguis- 
tics 16(2), 79-85), we reported the results of two experiments in which we estimated 
parameters of a statistical model of translation from English to French. 
In the first experiment, he English and French vocabularies each consisted of 
9,000 common words, and the model parameters were estimated from 40,000 pairs of 
sentences 25 words or less in length. Words outside the 9,000-word vocabularies in 
these sentences were mapped to special unknown words. 
In the second experiment, the vocabularies were limited to 1,000 common English 
words and 1,700 common French words, and the model parameters were estimated 
from 117,000 pairs of sentences 10 words or less in length that were completely covered 
by the respective vocabularies. 
In Figures 4, 5, and 6 of the paper, we erroneously presented parameter estimates 
from the 1,000-word experiment, while claiming in the text that they were from the 
9,000-word experiment. The parameter stimates for these two experiments differ con- 
siderably because of the restriction of the training corpus in the 1,000-word experiment 
to short, covered sentences. For example, the probability that hear is translated as bravo

is .992 in the 1,000-word experiment (see Figure 6 of the paper) 1, while it is only .808 
in the 9,000-word experiment (see Figure 6 above). This difference is due to the fact 
that the sentence pair (Hear, hear! \[ Bravo!) is extremely common in our data and is 
completely covered by the 1,000-word and 1,700-word vocabularies. 
Figures 4, 5, and 6 contain the parameter estimates from the 9,000-word experi- 
ment. Only probabilities greater than or equal to .01 are reported. 
1 We thank Ken Church for pointing out that this estimate is not consistent with the frequency with 
which hear translates to bravo in other data from the same source.
