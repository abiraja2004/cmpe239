Introduction' 
The SRI TIPSTER Phase III research program 
focused on improving information extraction (IE) 
accuracy by further extending their Phase II \[1\] 
research into linguistic approaches to data extraction. 
At the same time, SRI's efforts emphasized 
portability, and the moving away from hand-crafting 
complicated rules toward enabling nonexpert users to 
generate automatically new domain patterns. 
CPSL 
One step towards ease-of-use by nonexperts was the 
development reported in Phase II \[1\] of SRI's 
FastSpec language which enabled greater facility in 
generating and modifying the syntactic and semantic 
patterns necessary for identifying pertinent data. This 
was a motivating factor for the establishment of the 
Common Pattern Specification Language (CPSL) 
Working Group devoted to formulating a CPSL in 
order that different IE systems could share pattern 
libraries .2 
Open Domain System 
A central goal of SRI's open domain work was to 
allow users to develop their own customized IE 
systems called Fastlets for different opics of interest. 
SRI analyzed a large corpus of business news and 
developed a basic ontology of concepts. This 
ontology provides the basis for specifying patterns in 
a wide range of business news applications. Overall, 
the concepts and patterns cover 150 most common 
verbs and nominalizations in the Wall Street Journal. 
The patterns are currently being implemented in 
SRI's IE system, FASTUS.

"~ SRI's Doug Appelt has proven the feasibility of 
CPSL by developing TextPro, a Mac-based IE system 
written in CPSL. (www.ai.sri.com/-appelt)

As part of a collateral effort, SRI built Fastlets for 23 
of the 47 TREC-6 \[2\] topics which were used in two 
joint TREC-6 submissions with GE. In the first, SRI 
re-ranked the top 2000 documents returned by the GE 
routing query. In the second submission GE used the 
topic-relevant text identified by the SRI Fastlets for 
query expansion. The results were encouraging and 
indicate that the Fastlet approach to document 
detection is feasible. 
Merging 
The previous FASTUS merging algorithm was simple 
in that it merged newly extracted atastructures from 
a document with earlier extracted ones starting with 
the most recent. The results were~go0d, but error 
analysis showed that improving this process would 
help increase overall system accuracy. SRI's 
approach was to apply machine learning (ML) 
techniques in order to learn merging strategies 
automatically -- an essential capability for enabling 
nonexperts o port the system to a new domain. 
SRI employed two supervised learning techniques --
decision tree and maximum entropy. Both approaches 
were highly successful at classifying merges, but 
neither technique improved the overall accuracy of 
the end-to-end system. It is thought hat this is due to 
the fact that correct merges improve the system's 
score much more than bad merges hurt it. Therefore, 
although the supervised-learning-based m rges made 
more correct decisions than before, the incorrect 
blocking of a few correct merges reduced 
performance. SRI also experimented with 
unsupervised and weakly supervised learning of 
merging strategies. These results were reported at 
AAAI-98. \[3\] 
Coreference Resolution 
SRI's coreference module in FASTUS at the start of 
TIPSTER III performed close to the best published 
results for handling third person pronouns and 
reflexives. SRI worked on porting coreference 
improvements to the TIPSTER III system, and, at the 
same time, began work on coreferential elements to 
be  handled for the first time; bare nominals, 
possessed nominals, and indefinites. It was thought 
that overall system degradation corresponds to the 
lack of semantic and discourse information available 
to the FASTUS processing modules and that 
WordNet might be a possible source knowledge to 
provide this information. 
WordNet 
In another related effort, SRI performed experiments 
in utilizing WordNet (WN) as a knowledge source for 
IE. SRI developed mechanisms for automatically 
adding relations on top of WN with respect to 
nominalizations. There are nominalizations in WN 
but they are not linked to the word sense of the verb 
that they nominalize. Because information such as 
"manager" is an AGENT nominalization f "manage" 
is useful to the open domain approach, SRI developed 
routines to identify the appropriate word sense. They 
also analyzed how WN might improve coreference 
resolution. Although the potential payoff of using WN 
is still unclear, it is clear that utilization of WN is not 
a simple matter of plug-and-play.
