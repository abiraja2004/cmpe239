SESSION 13: NEW DIRECTIONS

The three papers of Session 13 address issues 
differing from those in the remainder of the 
workshop. Two employ a methodology to 
discover preferences for speech input in a multi- 
modal interface. The third raises issues of 
processing human language without any 
assumption that the speech or text has been 
converted to an online sequence of ASCII characters 
(or other character codes). 
As an introduction to the first two papers, consider 
Wizard of Oz experiments uch as used in 
collecting ATIS data. In such an experiment, the 
subject is asked to use a system to solve one or 
more problems. The "system" could be a person 
who simulates a proposed capability, for instance 
to determine language and interface properties for a 
proposed computer capability. Alternatively, the 
system might be an existing capability. 
Perhaps the first such experiment was performed by 
Ashok Malhotra (1975) to collect data that would 
suggest how varied (and challenging) textual 
queries would be in an interactive query 
application. Malhotra simulated the whole system, 
a very labor-intensive task. 
The first paper ("Mode Preference in a Simple 
Data-Retrieval Task") employs fully implemented 
components omeasure user preference for spoken 
input, versus filling a form, versus employing a
scroll bar to look up telephone numbers in an 
online telephone book. The paper immediately got 
my attention with the following statement in the 
introduction, "For activities in a workstation 
environment, formal comparisons of speech with 
other input modes have failed to demonstrate a clear 
advantage for speech on conventional ggregate 
measures of performance, such as time-to- 
completion . . . ". The author's experiments 
demonstrate a flaw in the analysis of previous 
results and go on to measure a marked preference 
for speech input, even when speech may not give 
the best time-to-completion results. 
The second paper, "A Simulation-Based Research 
Strategy for Designing Complex NL Systems," 
involves a person behind the scenes (the wizard) 
simulating the system, though much is automated. 
The resulting environment being simulated for the 
user is quite rich, allowing both speech and 
handwriting input. Careful preparation of the 
experimental environment enabled automated 
support so that response to the user is streamlined, 
thereby allowing the user to move at his/her own 
pace. To illustrate the kind of studies the 
methodology supports, the authors show some 
results suggesting that syntactic ambiguity is less 
when filling out a form (rather than when 
producing unconstrained input) and is also less in 
handwriting than in speech. 
The third paper, "Speech and Text-Image 
Processing in Documents," assumes minimal 
signal processing. For instance, they describe 
editing and indexing of audio forms rather than the 
text file resulting from continuous speech 
recognition. Similarly "text-image" processing, is
the editing of the bitmap representation resulting 
from scanning a document in, rather than editing a 
sequence of bytes in some character code such as 
ASCII. One of the tools described is therefore 
aptly named "Image Emacs". A third effort 
described in this paper is document image decoding, 
a framework for processing scanned-in documents.
