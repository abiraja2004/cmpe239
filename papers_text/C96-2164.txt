This paper describes a system which automatically 
creates an abstract of a newspaper article by selecting 
important sentences of a given text. To determine the 
importance of a sentence, several superficial features 
are considered, and weights for features are determined 
by multiple-regression a alysis of a hand processed cor- 
pus. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The rapid expansion of the Internet enables us to 
easily access a lot of information sources in the world. 
The ability to browse information quickly is therefore a
very important feature of an information retrieval and 
navigation system. Abstraction of a document is one 
useful tool for quick browsing of textual information. 
Generally, an abstract can be considered to be a con- 
cise text giving an outline of the original text. Creat- 
ing an abstract requires deep semantic processing with 
broad knowledge, and the strategy for generating an 
abstract depends on the type of target text. Abstracts 
created by humans tend to differ according to their 
creators' background knowledge and interests. Fur- 
thermore, as stated in \[6\], the same person is likely 
to create different abstracts of the same text at dif- 
ferent times. Simulating this human process is clearly 
outside the area that can be dealt with by current com- 
putational linguistics. There are, however, some cases 
in which an abstract can be created by using surface 
clues to make conjectures as to which portions are the 
most important without using deep semantic process- 
ing. 
The most practical way to create an abstract is thus 
to determine the most important portions by using sur- 
face clues. There are two lines of research based on this 
approach: one analyzes ome aspects of a text's struc- 
ture, such as the rhetorical structure \[7\], and selects 
some sentences according to this structure \[5, 3\]; the 
other analyzes urface features for each sentence in a 
given text and selects the most important sentences 
according to some heuristics \[6, 1, 9\]. In methods of 
former type, the rhetorical structure is appropriate for 
a relatively small set of sentences such as a paragraph, 
but it does not give enough information to create an 
abstract for a large set of sentences. In methods of the 
latter type, the validity of the heuristics is uncertain 
when the target text is changed. Therefore, this paper 
proposes a method for selecting important sentences by 
using an equation based on surface features and their 
weights, and a method for determining these weights 
by multiple-regression a alysis of abstracts created by 
humans. The target texts of this method are Japanese 
newspaper articles. 
2 Sur face  Features  o f  a Sen-  
tence  
The proposed method is to create an abstract by 
determining important sentences according to features 
extracted from each sentence. For each sentence in 
a given Japanese newspaper article, the following fea- 
tures 1 are analyzed: 
? Important Keywords: 
An important keyword is defined as a keyword 
that appears in another sentence or in a title. The 
number of points for this feature is tile total num- 
ber of occurrences of impot'tant keywords. 
? Tense: 
The tense of a sentence is analyzed as past or 
present. This feature gives 1 point for present, 
and 0 for past. 
l blest of these features were proposed in the previous tudies. 
Keywords were proposed in \[6\], sentence location was proposed 
in \[1\], sentence type was proposed in \[1, 9\], etc., and rhetori- 
ca\] relations were proposed in studies using rhetorical structures 
sud, as \[a\]. 
974 
? Type of a Sentence: 
Sentence types are fact, conjecture, or insistence. 
This feature gives 0 points for fact, 1 for conjec- 
ture, and 2 for insistence. 
? Rhetorical Relation: 
The rhetorical relations to the preceding context 
is analyzed as example, adverse, parallel, compar- 
ison, or connection. This feature gives 1 point for 
reason, 2 for example, and 0 for others. 
? Distance from the beginning of a text: 
In general, sentences located near the beginning of 
a text tend to be important. Therefore, sentences 
in the first paragraph are given 5 points for this 
feature, sentences in the next paragraph 4, and so 
on.  
? Distance from the end of a text: 
Sentences located near the ending of a text also 
tend to be important. Therefore, sentences in the 
last paragraph are given 5 points for this feature, 
sentences in the previous paragraph 4, and so on. 
The tense of a sentence is simply determined to be 
past if it has "ta" (an inflection for the past tense) in 
the last phr~e3 The reason why tense is used is that 
sentences tating about the current fact seem to be 
more important han ones about the past fact in the 
context of editorial articles. 
The sentence type is determined by checking special 
expressions in the last phrase, a For instance, if the fi- 
nal phrase contains "bekida" ("should") or "nakereba- 
naranai" ("must"), then its sentence type is insistence; 
if it contains "darou" ("probably ..."), then its type is 
conjecture; otherwise, its type is fact. Examples of spe- 
cial expressions used to determine sentence type are as 
follows: 
? Conjecture: kamosirenal (may), kanenai (be capa- 
ble of), souda (likely to), youda (likely to), darou 
(probably), etc. 
? Insistence: tai (want to do), hosii (want someone 
to do), bekida (should), nakereba-naranai (must), 
taisetu-dearu (important), hituyouda (necessary), 
etc. 
2 In this method,  past does not imply the past tense lit a str ict  
sense but rather ;the sentence is not in the present tense. In 
Japanese, "ta" implies the past tense, completion, and so on. 
Most cases are actual instances of the past tense. 
nit is sufficient to check in fire last phrase for Japanese sen- 
tences, because a predicative phrase is always located at the end 
of a Japanese senteltce. Therefore, another strategy is needed 
for languages in which a predicative phrase may be located in 
the middle of a sentence. 
The rhetorical relation is determined by checking 
special expressions both in the first phrase and in the 
last phrase of a sentence. For instance, if "sitakarada" 4 
is found in the last phrase, then the rhetorical relation 
is reason, and if the conjunction "sikasi" ("but") is 
found, then the rhetorical relation is adverse. 5 Exam- 
ples of special expressions used to determine rhetorical 
relations are listed below: 
? Example: tatoeba (for instance), nado (etc.), etc. 
? Adverse: sikasi (but), tokoroga (however), etc. 
? Comparison: koreni-taisi (while), etc. 
? Parallel: mata (further), sarani (in addition), etc. 
? Reason: karada (because), tameda (because), etc. 
3 Process  of Creat ing  an Ab-  
s t rac t  
The basic method for creating an abstract in most 
previous tudies has been to analyze the sentences of a 
text in terms of some surface features, and a heuristic 
to determine the most important sentences on the basis 
of these features. 
The method proposed in this paper formalizes the 
above approach so that the importance of each sentence 
is calculated as the sum of feature points multiplied by 
their feature weights. The most important sentences 
are then extracted as an abstract. The importance S
of a sentence is calculated as follows: 
r~ 
i=t  
where a is a constant, P/ is the number of points as- 
signed to the i-th feature, which is normalized to be 
between 0 and 1, and Wi is the weight assigned to the 
i-th feature. 
The steps in creating an abstract are as follows: 
1. For each sentence, calculate the importance. 
2. Select he sentence that has the highest impor- 
tance value among the unselected sentences. 
3. If the selected sentence sl has another sentence 
s2 in the previous context hat is related to st by 
any rhetorical structure, then s2 is also selected 
and marked. 
41n English, this expression corresponds to "because" in the 
first phrase. 
5These checking of sentence types and rhetorical relations are 
based on \[10\]. 
975 
4. If the ratio of the number of selected sentences to 
the number of sentences in the text exceeds the 
specified one, then terminate this process; other- 
wise, goto 2. 
These steps select sentences on the basis of their 
importance value, but they also respect the rhetori- 
cal structure to some extent (step 3), because if the 
rhetorical structure is totally ignored, the output text 
will be awkward to read. 
4 A Method  for Determin ing  
the Weights of Features 
Most previous systems can be considered to deter- 
mine the weights of features according to human intu- 
ition. On the other hand, this paper proposes a method 
for determining the wieghts of features by multiple- 
regression analysis of correct examples, which are ab- 
stracts created by testers. A tester selects important 
sentences that should be included in an abstract. The 
importance value of a sentence is defined as the number 
of supporters (testers who selected it as an important 
one) divided by the total number of testers. Let this 
importance value be S; we then get the following equa- 
tion for each sentence: 
S=a+LWI*Pi 
iml 
where, a is a constant, Pi is the number of points as- 
signed to the i-th featnre which is normalized to be 
between 0 to l, and Wi is the weight assigned to the 
i-th feature. 
In this equation, Wi is the only variable. There- 
fore, the feature weight Wi is calculated by multiple- 
regression analysis. 
5 Exper iment  
We conducted an experiment to check the validity of 
the proposed method. 
The testers were divided into two groups, A and B, 
each consisting 10 people. Those in group A selected 
important sentences (about 1/3 of the article) in 5 ed- 
itorials and 3 general articles from the Nikkei News- 
paper. Those in group B selected important sentences 
(about 1/3 of the article) in 3 editorials and 3 general 
articles, which were different from those used for group 
A. One of the editorials and one of the general articles

used for group B are shown in Figures 1 (a) and 2 (a), 
respectively. In each of these figures, the first number 
is a sentence number, the second number is the number 
of supporters in group B, and the last part is a rough 
English translation. G 
Table 1 shows two weight sets; weight set 1 was cre- 
ated by the author in such a way that sentences located 
near the beginning and end are regarded as important, 
sentence importance is not proportional to points for 
rhetorical relation, and the importance of insistence- 
type sentences i higher in editorials than in general 
articles\] Weight set 2, on the other hand, was calcu- 
lated from the results obtained from group A by the 
method described in the previous section. Weight set 
2 for general articles implies that sentences near the 
beginning are more important han ones near the end, 
and insistence-type sentences are less important, and 
so on. On the other hand, weight set 2 for editori- 
als implies that sentences both near the beginning and 
near the end are important, and that insistence-type 
sentences are important, s 
To check the validity of these weight sets, we com- 
pared the abstracts created by the system, using weight 
set 1 and 2, from the articles supplied to group B, with

rized by Nikkei Newspaper K.K. 
7This weight set 1 corresponds to the way used in previ- 
ous studies, where weights are determined according to human 
intuition. 
8The weight set calculated in this method can be used as basic 
materiM for creating a practical system, because it is difficult o 
ask enough people to do this experiment to ensure that the result 
is statistically meaningful. However, the generM tendency can 
be extracted, and the weight set is determined on the basis of 
this experiment.

the abstracts created by group B. For the general arti- 
cle in Figure 1 (a), the three most important sentences 
(roughly 1/3 of the article) determined by using the 
weight sets 1 and 2 are listed in Figures 1 (b) and (c), 
respectively. In this case, the three most important 
sentences selected by grou t) B were 0, 2, and 3. Like- 
wise, for the editorial in Figure 2 (a), the eight most 
iml)ortant sentences (roughly 1/a of the article) deter- 
mined by using weight sets l attd 2 are listed in Figures 
2 (b) and (c), respectively, in this case, the eight most 
important sentences selected by grou I) 11 are 0, 2, 3, 12, 
15, 20, 21, 22. Here, we introduce the following metric 
of estrangement to check which abstract is most similar 
to the result of group B: 
Estrangement = ~., ,(the number of supporters of a 
sentence si) - ~_~.</(the number of Sul)porters of a 
sentence s j) 
where s{ is a sentence that is included in an abstract by 
group B but not in an abstract created by the system, 
and s./ is a sentence that is not included in an abstract 
by group B but is included in an abstract created by 
the system. 
The estrangements of the articles in Figures 1 and 2 
are as follows: From this result, the weight set 2 calcu-

to adjust these heuristics for the given text. This pa- 
per proposed a method for this adjustment; that is, 
a method for determining weights of surface features 
by multiple-regression a alysis of abstracts created by 
human. By using this method, a system can have an 
ability to be applied to a variety of texts. 
7 Conc lus ion  
This paper has proposed a method for creating an 
abstract by using surface features and their weights 
to select important sentences, and a method for de- 
termining these \[eature weights by multiple-regression 
analysis of abstracts created by humans. By using the 
proposed method to calculate feature weight, this sys- 
tem can be applied to other types of texts, and gives 
results ntore similar to those of a human process than 
a set of weights based on human intuition. 
This abstract creation system is currently used in an 
informatioll navigation assistance system \[8\] as a tool 
for quickly viewing the contents of newspaper articles.

luted by multiple-regression a alysis is more similar to 
the human selection than the weight set 1 created ac- 
cording to the author's intuition. For the other general \[4\] 
articles used with group B, the estrangement values of 
weight set 2 are also better than those of weight set \[q 
1. In the other editorials, the estrangement values arc 
comparable. This implies that the weight set I is not 
such a bad estimate for editorials. \[~\]
