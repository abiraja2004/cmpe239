Abstract
The work presented in this paper concerns In-
formation Retrieval from geographical docu-
ments, i.e. documents with a major geographic
component. The final aim, in response to an
informational query of the user, is to return a
ranked list of relevant passages in selected doc-
uments, allowing text browsing within them.
We consider in this paper the spatial component
of the texts and the queries. The idea is to per-
form an off-line linguistic analysis of the doc-
ument, extracting spatial expressions (i.e. ex-
pressions denoting geographical localisations).
The point is that such expressions are (in gen-
eral) much more complex than simple place
names. We present a linguistic analyser which
recognises them, performing a semantic analy-
sis and computing symbolic representations of
their "content". These representations, stored
in the text thanks to XML annotation, will act
as indexes of passages with which queries are
compared. The matching of queries with text
expressions is a complex process, needing sev-
eral kinds of numeric and symbolic computa-
tions. A prospective outline of it is described.

Passage extraction from geographical
document
The work presented in this paper concerns Information
Retrieval (IR) from geographical documents, i.e. docu-
ments with a major geographic component. Let?s precise
at once that we are mainly interested in human geogra-
phy, where the phenomena under consideration are of so-
cial or economic nature. Such documents are massively
produced and consumed by academics as well as state or-
ganisations, marketing services of private companies and
so on. The final aim is, in response to an informational
query of the user, to return not only a set of documents
(taken as wholes) from the available collection of docu-
ments, but also a list of relevant passages allowing text
browsing within them.
Geographical information is spatialised information,
information so to speak anchored in a geographical space.
This characteristic is immediately visible on geographical
documents, which describe how some phenomena (often
quantified, either in a numeric or qualitative manner) are
related with a spatial and also, often, temporal localisa-
tion. Figure 1 gives an example of this informational
structure, extracted from our favourite corpus (H?rin,
1994), relative to the educational system in France. As
a consequence a natural way to query documents will be
through a 3-dimensional topic, Phenomenon-Space-Time
as shown in Figure 2. The goal is to select passages that
fulfil the whole bunch of criteria and to return them to the
user in relevance order.
The system we designed and currently develop for that
purpose is divided in two tasks: an off-line one, devoted
to linguistic analysis of the text, and an online one con-
cerning querying itself. Let?s give an overall view of the
process, focusing on the spatial dimension of texts and
analysis. Other aspects of the project, including espe-
cially the analysis of expressions denoting phenomena,
techniques used to link the three components of infor-
mation (Space, Time, Phenomena) and implementation
issues can be found in (Bilhaut, 2003).
Concerning text analysis, the goal is to locate, extract
and analyse the expressions which refer to some geo-
graphical localisation 1 so that they act as indexes of
text passages. The first remark to do is that we have to
cope (in general) with complex nominal expressions, not
only named geographical entities, as exemplified in fig-
ure 3. Indeed the collection of (proper) place names can

are treated in a similar manner.

From 1965 to 1985, the number of high-
school students has increased by 70%, but at
different rythms and intensities depending on
academies and departments. Lower in South-
West and Massif Central, moderate in Brittany
and Paris, the rise has been considerable in
Mid-West and Alsace. [...] Also occurs the
schooling duration increase which was more
important in departments where, in the middle
of the 60?s, study continuation after primary
school was far from being systematic.
Figure 1: Excerpt from (H?rin, 1994)
not constitute an adequate index: a mention of "north of
Paris" or "north of France" has obviously not the same
meaning as "Paris"or "France", not to speak of "south of
a Bordeaux-Gen?ve line". Moreover, some expressions
("industrial towns" or "rural departments?...)2" involve
a "qualitative" (demographic, sociological, economic...)
characterisation of the selected areas, involving some
knowledge of this kind.
The conclusion is that a literal matching of "queries"
against "text expressions" simply can?t do. Expres-
sions (and queries) must receive a linguistic analysis,
discovering their structure and producing some kind of
semantic representation. This is the goal of the off-line
text processing step. A linguistic analyser of spatial
expressions (nominal and prepositional phrases) have
been designed, which recognise them and produces
a symbolic representation of their "content". These
representations are associated with the text, thanks to
XML annotation, and constitute the index with which
queries will be compared. The linguistic analysis is
described in section 2.
Assuming that such an analysis is performed, we are

ready for querying. Clearly the easier way for a user to
formulate his/her query is to use also natural language.
The first step will be to apply the same linguistic analy-
sis, producing a symbolic representation of the same na-
ture as what was extracted from text. We have then to
perform some matching between (the representations of)
the query and the text. This is not a trivial task, as the
reader can guess, considering expressions and queries in
figures 2 and 3. To achieve this task, we will use ref-
erential information associated with named geographical
entities (long-lat coordinates) together with some compu-
tation exploiting the symbolic representations produced
by the linguistic analysis. A (prospective) sketch of this
process is described in section 3.
Summing up to situate the project among current re-
search, we see that the goals are those of Document Re-
trieval, but at an intra-document level, selecting passages
(Callan, 1994). But the methods are rather (though not
exclusively) those of Information Extraction in the sense
of MUC?s (Pazienza, 1997) and we are quite close to An-
swer Extraction in the sense of (Molla, 2000). In partic-
ular, the spatial component of geographical texts needs
much more than an access to geographical resources as
gazetteers: it needs both a specific semantic analysis of
complex linguistic expressions, and some symbolic and
numeric spatial computation for matching the query with
text. Let?s now consider these two aspects in turn.

2 Spatial analysis
2.1 Description of spatial expressions
Table 1 shows a significant sample of spatial expres-
sions found in our corpus. It enlightens the two com-
ponents which characterises their informational structure,
[Type] and [Zone], Which can be altogether present or
not. Hence three kinds of expressions can be considered:
1. Expressions in the first class contains only the
[Zone] part and denotes a georeferenced area (ex-
amples (1) and (2)). They are anchored in a
named place (Caen, France, Normandy...), later
called ?named geographical entity? (egn), on top of
which some spatial, geometrical, operations can act
(north/south of, the western/eastern part of, the sur-
roundings of...).
2. The second type of expressions denote a set of
places and can be summarised by the canonical
form [QUANTIFICATION]+[TYPE]+[ZONE]. The
set is quantified by a determiner (all, some, the, most
of...). The places are generally given an administra-
tive type (town, region...), and are located in a zone.
Sometimes, a further qualification, either sociolog-
ical (rural, urbanised, more or less densely popu-
lated, ...) or physical (near seaboard, mountainous,
...) specifies the type. We call this most general
type of expressions ?LocGeo? (geographical local-
isations): examples (4a?d),(5),(6).
3. Finally, the form [QUANTIFICATION] + [TYPE]
is a variant of the second form with a zone not ex-
pressed but implicit (and dependent on the context).
Note that this kind of expression is recognised by
our analyser if the qualification field is present. That
means that expressions as ?the districts? are not con-
sidered as a geographical entity in opposite of ?the
most rural districts? which can be geographically
determined: example (3).
Note that all components of the expression must be
taken into account when the semantic representation
is computed: not only the elements of geographical
type but also the quantification, the qualification, the
type which are crucial for querying and matching the
representation (see section 3).
2.2 Semantic representations
The semantics of expressions is represented by feature
structures as shown in figure 4.

mantic representation
The ?quant? feature corresponds to the quantification
[QUANT] part of expressions, expressed by generalised
determiners. It will be used to associate some approxi-
mate cardinality to the set of elements selected in the Loc-
Geo, allowing to compute some ?relevance value? with
respect to a given query (see section 3). Four types of
quantification are distinguished:
? absolute: ?fifteen districts?
? relative: ?32 per cent / half of the towns?
? exhaustive: ?all?, ?the?
? exhaustive-negative: ?no?, ?not any?
The ?type? field gives the qualitative characterisation
of the selected places. It can be administrative (ty_zone)
and/or socio-economic (geo).
Finally the ?zone? feature gives an abstract description
of the geographical localisation. It is defined by four pos-
sible sub-features:
? ?egn? (named geographical entity) with the name
and type of this entity;
? the ?coord? field gives the coordinates of the named
place, when available.
? when expressed, the ?position? describes the spatial
operator acting on the egn (for example a N-S-E-W
orientation);
? this information is completed by the ?loc? feature
(localisation), which can take only two values, in-
ternal or external, according to whether the geomet-
rically selected area ?position? criterium applies in-
side or outside the zone: ?in the north of France? is
internal to France, while ? north of Paris? is (proba-
bly) external.
It must be mentioned here that his last feature
raises interesting and difficult semantical consider-
ations and the implemented procedures yet subject
to strong limitations. Notably, it is strictly local (it
does not consider the context of the analysed ex-
pression), while the localisation can be ambiguous:
?north of Paris? can also denote an internal (north-
ern) part of Paris. More generally, a precise study of
spatial prepositions remains to be done.
The semantics of extracted phrases (represented as
feature structures) are exemplified in Fig. 4. Example
(4.b) stipulates an exhaustive determination selecting
all entities of the given TYPE (departments) located
in ZONE. This zone matches with the northern half
inside the named geographic entity (France). In (5) the
determination (induced by "quelques / some") is relative,
i.e. only a part of the elements given by the type is to
be considered. Here, TYPE stipulates that we only keep
from ZONE (Northern Normandy) the "towns" which
are "seaboard".
In fact, the structure (and semantics) of spatial expres-
sions is significantly more complex allowing notably:
? some kind of recursivity as in: "les villes maritimes
des d?partements ruraux du nord de la France" (the
seaboard towns of rural districts in north of France)
where the LocGeo ?villes maritimes? is embedded
inside the LocGeo ?d?partements ruraux du nord de
la France?.
? Geometrically defined zones: "le triangle Avignon-
Aix-Marseille" (the Avignon-Aix-Marseille trian-
gle); and areas defined by some kind of bounds:
"du Sud-Ouest ? la Bourgogne" (from South-West to
Burgundy).
? Enumerations of different kinds: "? Paris, Lyon et
Marseille" (in Paris, Lyon and Marseille), "dans les
d?partements de Bretagne et de Normandie" (in the
departments of Brittany and Normandy), "dans la
France du Centre et de l?Ouest" (in Center and West
of France), etc.
Such enumerations are quite frequent in the corpus,
and treated by the linguistic analyser. In particular
the different entity types appearing in an enumer-
ation are considered, and simultaneously the lexi-
cal head of the phrase is correctly distributed over
the constituents of its expansion, as in: ?dans les
d?partements bretons et normands, ? Paris, et dans
les r?gions du sud et du sud-ouest? where ?d?-
partements? is distributed over ?bretons? and ?nor-
mands?, and similarly ?r?gions? over ?sud? and
?sud-ouest?.
? some anaphoric expressions not still treated (?ces r?-
gions?, these regions).
2.3 Implementation
The whole process is implemented using the Lingua
Stream platform, designed for the project 3. We assume
a tokenisation and a morphological analysis of the text:
presently we use Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994) which de-
livers the lemma and part-of-speech (POS) categorisa-
tion. This is turned into a form acceptable by Prolog
(list of terms) and a definite clause grammar (DCG) per-
forms altogether syntactic and semantic analyses. The se-
mantic representations are synthesised in a compositional
process. Prolog proves to be an interesting choice here
since it allows complex semantic computations to be in-
tegrated in the grammar, and unification on feature struc-
tures thanks to GULP (Covington, 1994). Presently, the
grammar contains 160 rules and an internal lexical base
of about 200 entries, including grammatical words and
administrative or socio-economic terms. A gazetteer of
10000 named places located in France is used as external
lexicon, providing administrative types and geographical
coordinates4.
2.4 Evaluation and results
The analyser was designed by observation of (H?rin,
1994), and a qualitative evaluation on several other texts
seems to indicate that we captured correctly the general
structure of spatial expressions. However a more pre-
cise, quantitative, evaluation on a wide and diversified
corpus is still an open question, left for further work.
Another important aspect concerns evaluation of the se-
mantic analysers, esp. the spatial one. We have to com-
pare the semantic structures computed by the system with
expected ones and hence to define a relevant and robust
measure of adequation between complex feature struc-
tures.

http://www.nima.mil/gns/html/
The whole process takes about 30? on our favourite
corpus (H?rin, 1994) (200 text pages). 900 expressions
are recognised. Though processing time is not so crucial
for off-line analysis, we also want to improve the sys-
tem?s efficiency: working on the grammars and their im-
plementation techniques (such as bottom-up parsing and
compilation of feature structures as described in (Cov-
ington, 1994)),we hope to gain a factor 2 or 3. Other,
possibly more efficient, parsing methods could also be
considered if necessary, provided a good integration in
the LinguaStream platform is preserved.
3 Semantic matching
The work presented now is mainly prospective. As an-
nounced in part I, once a user has entered a query, the sys-
tem has to determine whether a given passage is relevant
or not. More precisely, we expect the system to deliver,
rather than a yes/no value, a relevance degree, so that a
ranked list of passages (from best to least) would be re-
turned to the user as an answer to his/her query. This task
requires to perform some matching between the semantic
representation of the request (calculated on-line) and the
one of a given passage (precalculated, i.e. off-line). Fig-
ure 5 shows a query (Q1) and six passage excerpts (from
P1 to P6) so that we have an overview of the problem :
for each passage, is this passage relevant, how relevant is
it, and according to what criteria ?
Q1) Which passages address Paris ?
P1) La capitale [...] - the capital (city).
P2) Les villes de la Seine ? l?exception de
Paris - Towns in the department of Seine, Paris
excepted
P3) Les grandes villes fran?aises- Big cities in
France.
P4) La moiti? nord de la France - The northern
half of France.
P5) Au sud d?une ligne Bordeaux-Gen?ve -
South of a Bordeaux-Gen?ve line.
P6) La plupart des villes d?Ile de France - Most
of towns in Ile de France.
Figure 5: One query and six passage excerpts
We can split the process in two major steps. First, a
compatibility diagnosis is delivered. In other words, it
consists in stating whether a passage could be relevant
or not, relying on the fact that there is no geographic in-
compatibility. This step should obviously ban P2 and P5.
Second, if a given passage is considered as "compatible",
the system computes a relevance degree, i.e. delivers a
value from zero (worst, shouldn?t happen if the first step
does its job) to one (best, you can?t find a more relevant
passage with respect to the query). This step would de-
liver a ranked list such as [P1, P3, P6, P4]. (The precise
order is still a open question, since it is not obvious that
P3 should come before P6, for instance).
Let?s go deeper in these two steps.
3.1 Compatibility computation
From examples in Figure 5. we can immedialtely see
that this task involves in the general case much more
than a simple word matching between the query and
text expressions. Otherwise, the system would only be
able to return passages which contain "Paris", namely
P4, which precisely should be banned as result of the
negation form (?Paris excepted?). Let?s present what
kind of knowledge and algorithms the system can use to
process query Q1 relatively to passages P1 to P6.
P1: In the context this excerpt is taken from, we are
concerned with France. A gazetteer or a GIS would
clearly say that France?s capital is Paris. Hence, the
answer is quite easy to get but, once more, doesn?t rely
on direct word matching.
P2: This excerpt has a two components structure,
namely "les villes d?Ile de France" and "? l?exception de
Paris". The first one needs an answer to :
- a "is type of X T?" question, X being here Paris, and T
"city", and
- a "does X belongs to Y ?" question, X still being Paris,
and Y being a french department, la Seine.
For both these questions, a gazetteer will do (and answer
positively). The second component "? l?exception de
Paris" states a restriction over the first requirement
and, since "Paris" matches "Paris", P2 would finally be
banned.
P3: Paris is a french city, as a gazetteer would say. But
we?re concerned here with more sofisticated semantics
as we have to interpret "big cities" (a piece of knowledge
not in the scope of a gazetteer). Since qualifiers such as
"big", "middle", "small" and so on, are relative to a set of
entities, we propose to generate off-line a resource such
as the rank of a X entity relatively to a criterium C among
all entities of a given type T. We can then interpret ?big?
as ?to be in the upper 20%?, and so on with ?medium?
or ?small?. Note that french qualifier "grand" is quite
ambiguous, (denoting population as well as surface), but
"largest" clearly involves surface criterion.
In the next two examples, we?ll have to go deeper in
geographic computation. Indeed, we understand that P4
is compatible with Q1, and that P5 isn?t, but how could
the system know that ? It has to compute it. This requires
a kind of geometric compatibility between shapes
associated with the entities denoted by the request and
text expressions, in topological terms: does X cover (or
intersect) Y ? Contrary to examples P1 to P3, where this
compatibility was de facto, embedded in gazetteer-like
knowledge, we have now to cope with complex and
dynamic geographic compatibility that no gazetteer nor
GIS could directly deliver : "the northern half of France"
nor "the south of a Bordeaux-Gen?ve line" couldn?t be
indexed in a database.
P4: "northern half of X" requires to cut the area
associated with X in two, so as to keep only the part
situated above the middle line. Here, X is France. A
request to a GIS gives the minimum and the maximum
longitude, so that we obtain the middle line, and finally
the shape as given in Figure 6. Then, we look at the
long-latt coordinates of Paris, and conclude that Paris
matches this passage.
P5: For similar reasons, but with a more sophisticated
shape, we obtain a polygon as given in Figure 7. And we
conclude here with a no answer, since the coordinates of
Paris locate it out of the polygon.
Figure 6: The northern half of France
We now evoke briefly other problems which must be
faced. First, observe that there are some subtilties in the
compatibility relation, as illustrated in the following ex-
ample. How to interpret fluzzy relations like "north of X"
or "south of X" ? What part of the area associated with X
do we have to keep ? Further work must be done to make
the best choice between something like Figure 6 where
we keep half of it, and another one where we would keep
a smaller part, or for exemple a cone above X. How to
interpret the french "nord de X" in terms of topological
?in? and ?out? relations ? "Le nord de Paris" is indeed
ambiguous and can mean "a certain part located in Paris,
in the north of it" as well as "a certain region out of Paris,
Figure 7: The south of a Bordeaux-Gen?ve line
more in the north?. Another problem concerns the socio-
economic qualification of geographical areas. As already
mentionned and shown in Table 1, such characterisations
appear in a significant way in the corpus, and should be
integrated in the matching process. Clearly again, simple
word matching is not adequate and we must invoke some
semantic knowledge, formalised as a semantic net or the
like.
3.2 Computing a relevance degree
At this point, the system should be able to state if a given
passage matches a query. However, a major task still re-
maining is to sort the passages from best to worst. This
task is quite difficult since it involves heterogenous data.
3.2.1 Quantification
If we consider examples envolving quantitification, such
as (4a)-(4d), we must admit that all entities which match
the ZONE and TYPE need not to be relevant. For exam-
ple in (4c) ?some? means that only a part of the set of
specified departments is concerned, on contrary to (4b)
where ?all? is the determiner. Which ones ? the linguis-
tic expression does not say. Howeve we can compute a
probability for any of these entities to be concerned so
that we can propose the following ranked list: (4b), (4d),
(4a), (4c) for a request concerning Calvados (department
situated in the north of France):
(4a) The semantic of "the quarter" gives (no GIS needed)
a wheight equals to 25%.
(4b) The semantic of "all" gives a wheight equal to
100%.
(4c) The semantic of "some" indicates that few entities
are concerned. In this case, we stipulate a number of
5 entities (that?s a heuristic). This leads to a wheight
equals to 5n , n being the number of districts included
in the zone. A request to the GIS gives n = 52.
Hence, the weight is 552 = 9.6%
(4d) In the same way, we obtain here 1552 = 29%.
Both linguistic knowledge (for semantic interpretation
of the determiners) and geographical knowledge (for an
evaluation of probability) will be needed in this process.
3.2.2 Granularity
We adopted a liberal strategy, which selects all pas-
sages compatible with the query. The counterpart is
clearly the risk of noisy answers. The granularity cri-
terion can provide a useful numeric evaluation of the
relevance of an expression. For example, consider the
query ?find passages concening the city of Caen?, with
respect to passages mentionning ?Caen? itself, ?the Cal-
vados? (department to which Caen belongs), ?Basse-
Normandie? (Caen?s administrative Region), and finally
?the northern half of France?. For granularity reasons
(left however for further consideration), it seems desir-
able to presents the four passages in this order, from the
closest to the farthest level.
3.2.3 Negation
The paradox is as follows : if we say A is true for all
X but Y, we positively say that not A is true for Y. Com-
ing back to P2, the fact that Paris is explicitely excluded
from the set of towns is a very strong information, almost
as strong as a positive mention. We think this problem
can be managed thanks to some symetric, i.e. negative
relevance value. Hence P2 receives degree -1 with re-
spect to query Q1. The user can choose to visualize or
not passages with negative degrees among other answers.
4 Conclusion
The work presented in this paper concerns passage ex-
traction from geographical documents. We focused on
the most characteristic aspect of the project, namely
the interpretation of the spatial component of texts and
queries. We first described a linguistic analyser which
performs a semantic analysis of expressions denoting ge-
ographical localisations. This analyser is operationnal
and will in the future be developped and experimented,
in order to cope with a greater variety of expression and
cover large corpora. Then we addressed the question of
the actual querying of text. We outlined a method for
matching user requests with the computed representa-
tions of spatial expressions. We believe that some aspects
of this process can be readily implemented. However it
also raises some difficult questions, we plan to investigate
in the next future.
