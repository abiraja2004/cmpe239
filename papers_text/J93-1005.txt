We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can be resolved on the basis 
of the relative strength of association of the preposition with verbal and nominal heads, estimated 
on the basis of distribution in an automatically parsed corpus. This suggests that a distributional 
approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call 
for complex reasoning. 
1. Introduction 
Prepositional phrase attachment is the canonical case of structural ambiguity, as in the 
timeworn example: 
Example 1 
I saw the man with the telescope. 
An analysis where the prepositional phrase \[pp with the telescope\] is part of the object 
noun phrase has the semantics "the man who had the telescope"; an analysis where the 
PP has a higher attachment (perhaps as daughter of VP) is associated with a semantics 
where the seeing is achieved by means of a telescope. The existence of such ambiguity 
raises problems for language models. It looks like it might require extremely complex 
computation todetermine what attaches to what. Indeed, one recent proposal suggests 
that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in 
which the entities referred to in a text are represented and reasoned about (Altmann 
and Steedman 1988). We take this argument to show that reasoning essentially involv- 
ing reference in a discourse model is implicated in resolving attachment ambiguities 
in a certain class of cases. If this phenomenon is typical, there is little hope in the 
near term for building computational models capable of resolving such ambiguities in 
unrestricted text. 
1.1 Structure-Based Ambiguity Resolution 
There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the 
literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand 
calculations in the semantic or discourse domains. The two main ones are as follows. 
? Right Association--a constituent tends to attach to another constituent 
immediately to its right (Kimball 1973).

? Minimal Attachment--a constituent tends to attach to an existing 
nonterminal using the fewest additional syntactic nodes (Frazier 1978). 
For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase 
in a verb + object context as in Example 1, these two principles--at least given the 
version of syntax that Frazier assumes--make opposite predictions: Right Association 
predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment. 
Psycholinguistic work on structure-based strategies i primarily concerned with 
modeling the time course of parsing and disambiguation, and acknowledges that other 
information enters into determining a final parse. Still, one can ask what information 
is relevant o determining a final parse, and it seems that in this domain structure- 
based disambiguation is not a very good predictor. A recent study of attachment 
of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a "Wizard of Oz" travel 
information experiment shows that neither Right Association or Minimal Attachment 
accounts for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990). And 
experiments by Taraban and McClelland (1988) show that the structural models are 
not in fact good predictors of people's behavior in resolving ambiguity. 
1.2 Resolving Ambiguity through Lexical Associations 
Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner (1990) found lexical preferences to be the key to 
resolving attachment ambiguity. Similarly, Taraban and McClelland found that lexical 
content was key in explaining people's behavior. Various previous proposals for guid- 
ing attachment disambiguation by the lexical content of specific words have appeared 
(e.g. Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; Marcus 1980). Unfortunately, it is not clear where 
the necessary information about lexical preferences i  to be found. Jenson and Binot 
(1987) describe the use of dictionary definitions for disambiguation, but dictionaries 
are typically rather uneven in their coverage. In the Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 
study (1990), the judgment of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for the 
cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was avail- 
able. Thus, we are posed with the problem of how we can get a good list of lexical 
preferences. 
Our proposal is to use co-occurrence of verbs and nouns with prepositions in a 
large body of text as an indicator of lexical preference. Thus, for example, the prepo- 
sition to occurs frequently in the context send NP_, that is, after the object of the verb 
send. This is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to. Similarly, from 
occurs frequently in the context withdrawal_, and this is evidence of a lexical asso- 
ciation of the noun withdrawal with the preposition from. This kind of association is
a symmetric notion: it provides no indication of whether the preposition is selecting 
the verbal or nominal head, or vice versa. We will treat the association as a property 
of the pair of words. It is a separate issue, which we will not be concerned with in 
the initial part of this paper, to assign the association to a particular linguistic licens- 
ing relation. The suggestion that we want to explore is that the association revealed 
by textual distribution--whether its source is a complementation relation, a modifica- 
tion relation, or something else--gives us information eeded to resolve prepositional 
attachment in the majority of cases. 
2. Discovering Lexical Association in Text 
A 13 million-word sample of Associated Press news stories from 1989 were auto- 
matically parsed by the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983 and in press), using Church's

part-of-speech analyzer as a preprocessor (Church 1988), a combination that we will 
call simply "the parser." The parser produces a single partial syntactic description 
of a sentence. Consider Example 2, and its parsed representation in Example 3. The 
information in the tree representation is partial in the sense that some attachment 
information is missing: the nodes dominated by "?" have not been integrated into 
the syntactic representation. Note in particular that many PPs have not been attached. 
This is a symptom of the fact that the parser does not (in many cases) have the kind of 
lexical information that we have just claimed is required in resolving PP attachment. 
Example 2 
The radical changes in export and customs regulations evidently are aimed at rem- 
edying an extreme shortage of consumer goods in the Soviet Union and assuaging 
citizens angry over the scarcity of such basic items as soap and windshield wipers. 
From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser, we extracted a table containing 
the heads of all noun phrases. For each noun phrase head, we recorded the follow- 
ing preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or not the parser had attached the 
preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the 
object of that verb. The entries in Table 1 are those generated from the text above. 
Each noun phrase in Example 3 is associated with an entry in the Noun column of 
the table. Usually this is simply the root of the head of the noun phrase: good is the 
root of the head of consumer goods. Noun phrases with no head, or where the head is 
not a common oun, are coded in a special way: DARTopNP represents a noun phrase 
beginning with a definite article and headed by a proper noun, and VING represents a 
gerundive noun phrase. PRO-+ represents he empty category which, in the syntactic 
theory underlying the parser, is assumed to be the object of the passive verb aimed. 
In cases where a prepositional phrase follows the noun phrase, the head preposition 
appears in the Prep column; attached and unattached prepositional phrases generate 
the same kinds of entries. If the noun phrase is an object, the root of the governing 
verb appears in the Verb column: aim is the root of aimed, the verb governing the empty

category \[fRo +\]. The last column in the table, labeled Syntax, marks with the symbol 
-V all cases where there is no preceding verb that might license the preposition: the 
initial subject of Example 2 is such a case. 
In the 13 million-word sample, 2,661,872 noun phrases were identified. Of these, 
467,920 were recognized as the object of a verb, and 753,843 were followed by a 
preposition. Of the object noun phrases identified, 223,666 were ambiguous verb- 
noun-preposition triples. 
3. Estimating Associations 
The table of verbs, nouns, and prepositions i in several respects an imperfect source 
of information about lexical associations. First, the parser gives us incorrect analyses 
in some cases. For instance, in the analysis partially described in Example 4a, the 
parser incorrectly classified probes as a verb, resulting in a table entry probe lightning 
in. Similarly, in Example 4b, the infinitival marker to has been misidentified as a 
preposition. 
Example 4 
a. \[NpThe space\] \[w~s probes\] [Npdetected lightning\] \[pp in Jupiter's upper 
atmosphere\] and observed auroral emissions like Earth's northern lights 
in the Jovian polar regions. 
b. The Bush administration told Congress on Tuesday it wants to 
\[v preserve\] \[Npthe right\] \[~ \[~ to\] control entry\] to the United States of 
anyone who was ever a Communist. 
Second, a preposition in an entry might be structurally related to neither the noun 
of the entry nor the verb (if there is one), even if the entry is derived from a correct 
parse.' For instance, the phrase headed by the preposition might have a higher locus 
of attachment: 
Example 5 
a. The Supreme Court today agreed to consider einstating the murder 
conviction of a New York City man who confessed to \[v,NG killing\] \[Nrhis 
former girlfriend\] \[p after\] police illegally arrested him at his home. 
b. NBC was so afraid of hostile advocacy groups and unnerving advertisers 
that it shot its dramatization of the landmark court case that 
\[VPAST legalized\] [Nrabortion\] \[Pr under two phony script titles\] 
The temporal phrase headed by after modifies confess, but given the procedure de- 
scribed above, Example 5a results in a tuple kill girlfriend after. In the second example, 
a tuple legalize abortion under is extracted, although the PP headed by under modifies 
the higher verb shot. 
Finally, entries of the form verb noun preposition do not tell us whether to induce 
a lexical association between verb and preposition or between oun and preposition. We 
will view the first two problems as noise that we do not have the means to eliminate, 
1 For present purposes, we can consider a parse correct if it contains no incorrect information in the 
relevant area. Provided the PPs in Example 5 are unattached, the parses would be correct in this sense. 
The incorrect information is added by our table construction step, which (given our interpretation f the 
table) assumes that a preposition following an object NP modifies either the NP or its governing verb. 
107 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
and partially address the third problem in a procedure we will now describe. We want 
to use the verb-noun-preposition table to derive a table of bigrams counts, where a 
bigram is a pair consisting of a noun or verb and an associated preposition (or no 
preposition). To do this we need to try to assign each preposition that occurs either to 
the noun or to the verb that it occurs with. In some cases it is fairly certain whether the 
preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, this is far less certain. Our 
approach is to assign the clear cases first, then to use these to decide the unclear cases 
that can be decided, and finally to divide the data in the remaining unresolved cases 
between the two hypotheses (verb and noun attachment). The procedure for assigning 
prepositions i as follows: 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
No Preposition--if  there is no preposition, the noun or verb is simply 
entered with a special symbol NULL, conceived of as the null 
preposition. (Items b, f, g, and j-1 in Table 1 are assigned). 
Sure Verb Attach 1--the preposition is attached to the verb if the noun 
phrase head is a pronoun. 
Sure Verb Attach 2---the preposition is attached to the verb if the verb is 
passivized, unless the preposition is by. The instances of by following a 
passive verb were left unassigned. (Item c in Table 1 is assigned). 
Sure Noun Attach--the preposition is attached to the noun, if the noun 
phrase occurs in a context where no verb could license the prepositional 
phrase, specifically if the noun phrase is in a subject or other pre-verbal 
position. The required syntactic information is present in the last column 
of the table derived from the parse. (Item a in Table 1 is assigned.) 
Ambiguous Attach 1--Using the table of attachments computed so far, if 
the LA-score for the ambiguity (a score that compares the probability of 
noun versus verb attachment, as described below) is greater than 2.0 or 
less than -2.0, then assign the preposition according to the LA-score. 
Iterate until this step produces no new attachments. (Item d in Table 1 
may be assigned.) 
Ambiguous Attach 2-- for  the remaining ambiguous triples, split the 
datum between the noun and the verb, assigning a count of .5 to the 
noun-preposition pair and .5 to the verb-preposition pair. (Item d in 
Table 1 is assigned, if not assigned in the previous step.) 
Unsure Attach--assign remaining pairs to the noun. (Items e, h, and i in 
Table 1 are assigned.) 
This procedure gives us bigram counts representing the frequency with which a given 
noun occurs associated with an immediately following preposition (or no preposition), 
or a given verb occurs in a transitive use and is associated with a preposition imme- 
diately following the object of the verb. We use the following notation: f(w, p) is the 
frequency count for the pair consisting of the verb or noun w and the preposition p. 
The unigram frequency count for the word w (either a verb, noun, or preposition) can 
be viewed as a sum of bigram frequencies, and is written f(w). For instance, if p is a 
preposition, f(p) = ~wf~W, p).

3.1 The Procedure for Guessing Attachment 
Our object is to develop a procedure to guess whether a preposition is attached to 
the verb or its object when a verb and its object are followed by a preposition. We 
assume that in each case of attachment ambiguity, there is a forced choice between 
two outcomes: the preposition attaches either to the verb or to the noun. 2 For example, 
in Example 6, we want to choose between two possibilities: either into is attached to 
the verb send or it is attached to the noun soldier. 
Example 6 
Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan ... 
In particular, we want to choose between two structures: 
Example 7 
a. verb_attach structure: \[vpsend \[NP" soldier NULL\] \[pp into ..\] ..\] 
b. noun_attach structure: \[vpsend \[NP" soldier \[Fpinto ..\]\] .. \] 
For the verb_attach case, we require not only that the preposition attach to the verb 
send but also that the noun soldier have no following prepositional phrase attached: 
since into directly follows the head of the object noun phrase, there is no room for 
any post-modifier of the noun soldier. We use the notation NULL to emphasize that 
in order for a preposition licensed by the verb to be in the immediately postnominal 
position, the noun must have no following complements (or adjuncts). For the case of 
noun attachment, the verb may or may not have additional prepositional complements 
following the prepositional phrase associated with the noun. 
Since we have a forced choice between two outcomes, it is appropriate to use 
a likelihood ratio to compare the attachment probabilities (cf. Mosteller and Wallace 
1964). 3 In particular, we look at the log of the ratio of the probability of verb_attach 
to the probability of noun_attach. We will call this log likelihood ratio the LA (lexical 
association) score. 
P(verb~ttach p \[ v, n) 
LA(v, n,p) = log 2 P(noun_attach p \[ v, n) 
For the current example, 
P(verb_attach into \[ sendv, soldierN) ,~ P( into\[sendv ) ? P(NULL\[soldierN) 
and 
P(noun_attach into \[ sendv, soldierN) ~, P(into\[soldierN). 
Again, the probability of noun attachment does not involve a term indicating that the 
verb sponsors no (additional) complement; when we observe a prepositional phrase 
that is in fact attached to the object NP, the verb might or might not have a complement 
or adjunct following the object phrase. 
2 Thus we are ignoring the fact that the preposition may in fact be licensed by neither the verb nor the 
noun, as in Example 5. 
3 In earlier versions of this paper we used a t-test for deciding attachment and a different procedure for 
estimating the probabilities. The current procedure has several advantages. Unlike the t-test used 
previously, it is sensitive to the magnitude of the difference between the two probabilities, not to our 
confidence in our ability to estimate those probabilities accurately. And our estimation procedure has 
the property that it defaults (in case of novel words) to the average behavior for nouns or verbs, for 
instance, reflecting a default preference with of for noun attachment. 
109 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
We can estimate these probabilities from the table of co-occurrence counts as: 4 
P(into\[sendv) 
P (NULL Jsoldier N ) 
P( into\[soldierN ) ,-~ 
f(sendv, into) 86 
- - .049 f(sendv) 1742.5 
f(soldierN, NULL) 1182 
f(soldierN) 1478 - -  - .800 
f(soldierN, into) 1 
- - -  - .0007 f (soldierN) 1478 
Thus, the LA score for this example is: 
LA ( sendv , soldierN , into) = log 2 .049 *.800 
.0007 
5.81 
The LA score has several useful properties. The sign indicates which possibility, 
verb attachment or noun attachment, is more likely; an LA score of zero means they 
are equally likely. The magnitude of the score indicates how much more probable one 
outcome is than the other. For example, if the LA score is 2.0, then the probabil ity of 
verb attachment is four times greater than noun attachment. Depending on the task, 
we can require a certain threshold of LA score magnitude before making a decision) 
As usual, in dealing with counts from corpora we must  confront the problem of 
how to estimate probabilities when counts are small. The max imum likelihood estimate 
described above is not very good when frequencies are small, and when frequencies 
are zero, the formula will not work at all. We use a crude adjustment to observed 
frequencies that has the right general properties, though it is not likely to be a very 
good estimate when frequencies are small. For our purposes, however exploring in 
general the relation of distribution in a corpus to attachment d isambiguat ion- -we 
believe it is sufficient. Other approaches to adjusting small frequencies are discussed 
in Church et al (1991) and Gale, Church, Yarowsky (in press). 
The idea is to use the typical association rates of nouns and verbs to interpolate 
our probabilities. Where f(N, p) = En f(n, p), f(V, p) = ~vf(V,  p), f(N) -- End(n) and 
4 The nonintegral count for send is a consequence of the data-splitting step Ambiguous Attach 2, and the 
definition of unigram frequencies as a sum of bigram frequencies. 
5 An advantage of the likelihood ratio approach is that we can use it in a Bayesian discrimination 
framework to take into account other factors that might influence our decision about attachment (see 
Gale, Church, and Yarowsky \[in press\] for a discussion of this approach). We know of course that other 
information has a bearing on the attachment decision. For example, we have observed that if the noun 
phrase object includes a superlative adjective as a premodifier, then noun attachment is certain (for a 
small sample of 16 cases). We could easily take this into account by setting the prior odds ratio to 
heavily favor noun attachment: let's suppose that if there is a superlative in the object noun phrase, 
then noun attachment is say 1000 times more probable than verb attachment; otherwise, they are 
equally probable. Then following Mosteller and Wallace (1964), we assume that 
Final attachment odds = log 2(initial odds) + LA. 
In case there is no superlative in the object, the initial log odds will be zero (verb and noun attachment 
are equally probable), and the final odds will equal our LA score. If there is a superlative, 
1 
Final attachment odds = log 21-- ~ -}- LA(v, n, p). 
110 
Donald Hindle and Mats Rooth Structural Ambiguity and Lexical Relations 
f(V) = ~vf(V),  we redefine our probability estimates in the following way: 
f(n,p) + f(N,p) f(N) 
P(p \[ n) = f(n) + 1 
f(v, p) + \[(V,p) f(v) 
P(P l v) = f(v) + 1 
When f(n) is zero, the estimate for P(p I n) is the average (~)  across all nouns, f(N) 
and similarly for verbs. When f(n, p) is zero, the estimate used is proportional to this 
average. If we have seen only one case of a noun and it occurred with a preposition 
p (that is f(n, p) = 1 and f(n) = 1 ), then our estimate is nearly cut in half. This is the 
kind of effect we want, since under these circumstances we are not very confident in 
1 as an estimate of P(p I n). When f(n, p) is large, the adjustment factor does not make 
much difference. In general; this interpolation procedure adjusts small counts in the 
right direction and has little effect when counts are large. 
For our current example, this estimation procedure changes the LA score little: 
? \ f (V , in to )  f(soldierN,NULL)+~LL) f (sendv,mto) + f~fl-ffy- 
LA(sendv, soldier~, into) = log 2 f(sendv)+l f(s?ldierN)+l 
. . f (N  in to )  f(s?l&erN~mt?)+"

= 5.87. 
The LA score of 5.87 for this example is positive and therefore indicates verb attach- 
ment; the magnitude is large enough to suggest a strong preference for verb attach- 
ment. This method of calculating the LA score was used both to decide unsure cases 
in building the bigram tables as described in Ambiguous Attach 1, and to make the 
attachment decisions in novel ambiguous cases, as discussed in the sections following. 
4. Testing Attachment 
To evaluate the performance of the procedure, 1000 test sentences in which the parser 
identified an ambiguous verb-noun-preposit ion triple were randomly selected from 
AP news stories. These sentences were selected from stories included in the 13 mill ion- 
word sample, but the particular sentences were excluded from the calculation of lexical 
associations. The two authors first guessed attachments on the verb-noun-preposit ion 
triples, making a judgment on the basis of the three headwords alone. The judges were 
required to make a choice in each instance. This task is in essence the one that we will 
give the computer- - to judge the attachment without any more information than the 
preposition and the heads of the two possible attachment sites. 
This initial step provides a rough indication of what we might expect o be achiev- 
able based on the information our procedure is using. We also wanted a standard of 
correctness for the test sentences. We again judged the attachment for the 1000 triples, 
111 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
this time using the full-sentence context, first grading the test sentences separately, 
and then discussing examples on which there was disagreement. Disambiguating the 
test sample turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task. While many decisions were 
straightforward, more than 10% of the sentences seemed problematic to at least one 
author. There are several kinds of constructions where the attachment decision is not 
clear theoretically. These include idioms as in Examples 8 and 9, light verb construc- 
tions (Example 10), and small clauses (Example 11). 
Example 8 
But over time, misery has given way to mending. 
Example 9 
The meeting will take place in Quantico. 
Example 10 
Bush has said he would not make cuts in Social Security. 
Example 11 
Sides said Francke kept a .38-caliber revolver in his car's glove compartment. 
In the case of idioms, we made the assignment on the basis of a guess about the 
syntactic structure of the idiom, though this was sometimes difficult to judge. We 
chose always to assign light verb constructions to noun attachment, based on the fact 
that the noun supplies the lexical information about what prepositions are possible, 
and small clauses to verb attachment, based on the fact that this is a predicative 
construction lexically licensed by the verb. 
Another difficulty arose with cases where there seemed to be a systematic se- 
mantically based indeterminacy about the attachment. In the situation described by 
Example 12a, the bar and the described event or events are presumably in the same 
location, and so there is no semantic reason to decide on one attachment. Example 12b 
shows a systematic benefactive indeterminacy: if you arrange something for someone, 
then the thing arranged is also for them. The problem in Example 12c is that signing 
an agreement usually involves two participants who are also parties to the agreement. 
Example 13 gives some further examples drawn from another test sample. 
Example 12 
a . . . .  known to frequent he same bars in one neighborhood. 
b. Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion for Bush 
and his old submarine buddies ... 
c. We have not signed a settlement agreement with them. 
Example 13 
a. It said the rebels issued a challenge to soldiers in the area and fought with 
them for 30 minutes. 
b. The worst such attack came Nov. 11 when a death squad firing 
submachine guns killed 43 people in the northwest town of Segovia. 
c. Another charge raised at the Contra news conference was that the 
Sandinistas have mined roads along the Honduran and Costa Rican 
borders. 
112

d. Buckner said Control Data is in the process of negotiating a new lending 
agreement with its banks. 
e . . . .  which would require ailing banks and S&Ls to obtain advance 
permission from regulators before raising high-cost deposits through 
money brokers. 
f. She said the organization has opened a cleaning center in Seward and she 
was going to Kodiak to open another. 
In general, we can say that an attachment is semantically indeterminate if situations 
that verify the meaning associated with one attachment also make the meaning as- 
sociated with the other attachment true. Even a substantial overlap (as opposed to 
identity) between the classes of situations verifying the two meanings makes an at- 
tachment choice difficult. 
The problems in determining attachments are heterogeneous. The idiom, light 
verb, and small clause constructions represent cases where the simple distinction be- 
tween noun attachment and verb attachment perhaps does not make sense, or is very 
theory-dependent. It seems to us that the phenomenon of semantically based inde- 
terminacy deserves further exploration. If it is often difficult to decide what licenses 
a prepositional phrase, we need to develop language models that appropriately cap- 
ture this. For our present purpose, we decided to make an attachment choice in all 
cases, in some cases relying on controversial theoretical considerations, or relatively 
unanalyzed intuitions. 
In addition to the problematic cases, 120 of the 1000 triples identified automati- 
cally as instances of the verb-object-preposition c figuration turned out in fact to be 
other constructions, often as the result of parsing errors. Examples of this kind were 
given above, in the context of our description of the construction of the verb-noun- 
preposition table. Some further misidentifications that showed up in the test sample 
are: identifying the subject of the complement clause of say as its object, as in Exam- 
ple 10, which was identified as (say ministers from), and misparsing two constituents a
a single-object noun phrase, as in Example 11, which was identified as (make subject o). 
Example 14 
a. Ortega also said deputy foreign ministers from the five governments 
would meet Tuesday in Managua, ... 
b. Congress made a deliberate choice to make this commission subject o the 
open meeting requirements ...
After agreeing on the 'correct' attachment for the test sample, we were left with 880 dis- 
ambiguated verb-noun-preposition triples, having discarded the examples that were 
not instances of the relevant construction. Of these, 586 are noun attachments and 294 
are verb attachments. 
4.1 Evaluating Performance 
First, consider how the simple structural attachment preference schemas perform at 
predicting the outcome in our test set. Right Association predicts noun attachment 
and does better, since in our sample there are more noun attachments, but it still has 
an error rate of 33%. Minimal Attachment, interpreted as entailing verb attachment, 
has the complementary error rate of 67%. Obviously, neither of these procedures i
particularly impressive.

Now consider the performance of our lexical association (LA) procedure for the 
880 standard test sentences. Table 2 shows the performance for the two human judges 
and for the lexical association attachment procedure. First, we note that ~he task of 
judging attachment on the basis of verb, noun, and preposition alone is not easy. The 
figures in the entry labeled "combined precision" indicate that the human judges had 
overall error rates of 12-15%. 6 The lexical association procedure is somewhat worse 
than the human judges, with an error rate of 20%, but this is an improvement over 
the structural strategies. 
The table also gives results broken down according to N vs. V attachment. The 
precision figures indicate the proportion of test items assigned to a given category 
that actually belong to the category. For instance, N precision is the fraction of cases 
that the procedure identified as N attachments hat actually were N attachments. The 
recall figures indicate the proportion of test items actually belonging to a given category 
that were assigned to that category: N precision is the fraction of actual N attachments 
that were identified as N attachments. The LA procedure recognized about 85% of the 
586 actual noun attachment examples as noun attachments, and about 70% of the 
actual verb attachments as verb attachments. 
If we restrict he lexical association procedure to choose attachment only in cases 
where the absolute value of the LA score is greater than 2.0 (an arbitrary threshold 
indicating that the probability of one attachment is four times greater than the other), 
we get attachment judgments on 621 of the 880 test sentences, with overall precision of 
about 89%. On these same examples, the judges also showed improvement, as evident 
in Table 3. 7 
6 Combined precision is the proportion of assigned items that were correctly assigned. Combined recall 
is the proportion of all items that were correctly assigned. These differ if some items are left 
unassigned, asin Table 3. 
7 The recall figures for the judges do not have the usual interpretation, since the judges did not have the 
option of passing on test items. The ratios given in parentheses indicate the proportion of items in the 
relevant category that were both correctly labeled by the judge and had a likelihood ratio score with 
absolute value greater than 2.0. Thus these figures are of interest only in relation to the recall figures 
for LA.

0.25 840 (95.5) 0.807 0.770 
0 880 (100.0) 0.797 0.797 
The fact that an LA score threshold improves precision indicates that the LA score 
gives information about how confident we can be about an attachment choice. In 
some applications, this information is useful. For instance, suppose that we wanted 
to incorporate the PP attachment procedure in a parser such as Fidditch. It might 
be preferable to achieve increased precision in PP attachment, in return for leaving 
some PPs unattached. For this purpose, a threshold could be used. Table 4 shows the 
combined precision and recall levels at various LA thresholds. It is clear that the LA 
score can be used effectively to trade off precision and recall, with a floor for the forced 
choice at about 80%. 
A comparison of Table 3 with Table 2 indicates, however, that the decline in recall is 
severe for V attachment. And in general, the performance of the LA procedure is worse 
on V attachment examples than on N attachments, according to both precision and 
recall criteria. The next section is concerned with a classification of the test examples, 
which gives insight into why performance on V attachments i  worse.

4.2 Underlying Relations 
Our model takes frequency of co-occurrence asevidence of an underlying relationship 
but makes no attempt to determine what sort of relationship is involved. It is interest- 
ing to see what kinds of relationships are responsible for the associations the model is 
identifying. To investigate this we categorized the 880 triples according to the nature 
of the relationship underlying the attachment. In many cases, the decision was diffi- 
cult. The argument/adjunct distinction showed many gray cases between clear partici- 
pants in an action and clear adjuncts, such as temporal modifiers. We made rough best 
guesses to partition the cases into the following categories: argument, adjunct, idiom, 
small clause, systematic locative indeterminacy, other systematic ndeterminacy, and 
light verb. With this set of categories, 78 of the 880 cases remained so problematic that 
we assigned them to the category other. 
Table 5 shows the proportion of items in a given category that were assigned the 
correct attachment by the lexical association procedure. Even granting the roughness 
of the categorization, some clear patterns emerge. Our approach is most successful at 
attaching arguments correctly. Notice that the 378 noun arguments constitute 65% of 
the total 586 noun attachments, while the 104 verb arguments amount o only 35% 
of the 294 verb attachments. Furthermore, performance with verb adjuncts is worse 
than with noun adjuncts. Thus much of the problem with V attachments noted in the 
previous ection appears to be attributable to a problem with adjuncts, particularly 
verbal ones. Performance on verbal arguments remains worse than performance on 
nominal ones, however. 
The remaining cases are all complex in some way, and the performance is poor on 
these classes, showing clearly the need for a more elaborated model of the syntactic 
structure that is being identified. 
5. Comparison with a Dictionary 
The idea that lexical preference is a key factor in resolving structural ambiguity leads 
us naturally to ask whether existing dictionaries can provide information relevant to 
disambiguation. The Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary (Sinclair et al 
1987) is useful for a comparison with the AP sample for several reasons: it was com- 
piled on the basis of a large text corpus, and thus may be less subject o idiosyncrasy

than other works, and it provides, in a separate field, a direct indication of prepositions 
typically associated with many nouns and verbs. From a machine-readable v rsion of 
the dictionary, we extracted a list of 1,942 nouns associated with a particular preposi- 
tion, and of 2,291 verbs associated with a particular preposition after an object noun 
phrase. 8
These 4,233 pairs are many fewer than the number of associations in the AP sample 
(see Table 6), even if we ignore the most infrequent pairs. Of the total 76,597 pairs, 
20,005 have a frequency greater than 3, and 7,822 have a frequency that is greater 
than 3 and more than 4 times what one would predict on the basis of the unigram 
frequencies of the noun or verb and the preposition. 9 
We can use the fixed lexicon of noun-preposit ion and verb-preposition associ- 
ations derived from COBUILD to choose attachment in our test set. The COBUILD 
dictionary has information on 257 of the 880 test verb-noun-preposit ion triples. In 
241 of those cases, there is information only on noun or only on verb association. In 
these cases, we can use the dictionary to choose the attachment according to the asso- 
ciation indicated. In the remaining 16 cases, associations between the preposition and 
both the noun and the verb are recorded in the dictionary. For these, we select noun 
attachment, since it is the more probable outcome in general. For the remaining cases, 
we assume that the dictionary makes no decision. Table 7 gives the results obtained 
8 We included particles in these associations, since these were also included in our corpus of bigrams. 
9 The latter condition is spelled out as 
f(w,p) > 4f(w) f(p) 
N N N ~ 
where U is ~w, J (w,  p), the total number of token bigrams. It is equivalent tow and p having a 
mutual information (defined as 
I(w, p) = log 2 f@ f_~u ) 
greater than 2. This threshold of 2, of course, is an arbitrary cutoff.

by this attachment procedure. The precision figure is similar to that obtained by the 
lexical association procedure with a threshold of zero, but the recall is far lower: the 
dictionary provides insufficient information in most cases. 
Like the lexicon derived from the COBUILD dictionary, the fixed lexicon of 7,822 
corpus-derived associations derived from our bigram table as described above (that 
is, all bigrams where f(w~ p) > 3 and I(w, p) > 2) contains categorical information 
about associations. Using it for disambiguation i the way the COBUILD dictionary 
was used gives the results indicated in Table 7. The precision is similar to that which 
was achieved with the LA procedure with a threshold of 2, although the recall is 
lower. This suggests that while overall coverage of association pairs is important, the 
information about the relative strengths of associations contributing to the LA score 
is also significant. 
It must be noted that the dictionary information we derived from COBUILD was 
composed for people to use in printed form. It seems likely that associations were 
left out because they did not serve this purpose in one way or another. For instance, 
listing many infrequent or semantically predictable associations might be confusing. 
Furthermore, our procedure undoubtedly gained advantage from the fact that the test 
items are drawn from the same body of text as the training corpus. Nevertheless, the 
results of this comparison suggest hat for the purpose of this paper, a partially parsed 
corpus is a better source of information than a dictionary. This conclusion should not 
be overstated, however. Table 6 showed that most of the associations in each lexicon 
are not found in the others. Table 8 is a sample of a verb-preposit ion association 
dictionary obtained by merging information from the AP sample and from COBUILD, 
illustrating both the common ground and the differences between the two lexicons. 
Each source of information provides intuitively important associations that are missing 
from the other. 
6. D iscuss ion  
In our judgment, the results of the lexical association procedure are good enough 
to make it useful for some purposes, in particular for inclusion in a parser such as 
Fidditch. The fact that the LA score provides a measure of confidence increases this 
usefulness, since in some applications (such as exploratory linguistic analysis of text

discarding a proportion of the data. 
From another perspective, our results are less good than what might be demanded. 
The performance of the human judges with access just to the verb-noun-preposit ion 
triple is a standard of what is possible based on this information, and the lexical 
association procedure falls somewhat short of this standard. The analysis of underlying 
relations indicated some particular areas in which the procedure did not do well, and 
where there is therefore room for improvemenf. In particular, performance on adjuncts 
was poor. A number of classes of adjuncts, such as temporal ones, are fairly easy to 
identify once information about the object of the preposition is taken into account. 
Beginning with such an identification step (which could be conceived of as adding a 
feature such as \[+temporal\] to individual prepositions, or replacing individual token 
prepositions with an abstract emporal preposition) might yield a lexical association 
procedure that would do better with adjuncts. But it is also possible that a procedure 
that evaluates associations with individual nouns and verbs is simply inappropriate 
for adjuncts. This is an area for further investigation. 
This experiment was deliberately limited to one kind of attachment ambiguity. 
However, we expect that the method will be extendable to other instances of PP 
attachment ambiguity, such as the ambiguity that arises when several prepositional 
phrases follow a subject NP, and to ambiguities involving other phrases, especially 
phrases uch as infinitives that have syntactic markers analogous to a preposition. 
119 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 
We began this paper by alluding to several approaches to PP attachment, specifi- 
cally work assuming the construction of discourse models, approaches based on struc- 
tural attachment preferences, and work indicating a dominant role for lexical prefer- 
ence. Our results tend to confirm the importance of lexical preference. However, we 
can draw no firm conclusions about the other approaches. Since our method yielded 
incorrect results on roughly 20% of the cases, its coverage is far from complete. This 
leaves a lot of work to be done, within both psycholinguistic and computational p- 
proaches. Furthermore, as we noted above, contemporary psycholinguistic work is 
concerned with modeling the time course of parsing. Our experiment gives no infor- 
mation about how lexical preference information is exploited at this level of detail, 
or the importance of such information compared with other factors such as struc- 
tural .preferences at a given temporal stage of the human parsing process. However, 
the numerical estimates of lexical association we have obtained may be relevant o a 
psycholinguistic nvestigation of this issue.
