The paper conta ins  the  descr ip t ion  of  a database mana- 
gement computer operation system called operat ion logic. This 
system is a formal logic with wel l -def lned formulas as se- 
mantic language clauses and with reasoning by means of modus 
ponens rules. There are four frames - CLAUSE, QUESTION, 
I:~O~T.~, SYST~. Each of  these  frames i s  processed by one 
program. By means of  these  programs i t  can be rea l i zed  under -  
s tand ing  of  any c lause ,  answer ing any reasonab le  quest ion ,  
so lv ing  az~7 reasonab le  problem and unders tand ing  any organ izat -  
l one l  s t ruc ture .  Some a lgor i thms of operat ion  log ic  are  de-  
sc r ibed  and examples of  c lauses  are exh ib i ted .  Our approach 
i s  the fo l low ing :  
(1) In fo rmat ion  process in~ of  sub teots~ Mater ia l  ob jec ts  
are  anorganic  ob jec ts  or  o rgan ic  ones.  They are a l so  non- l i ve  
ob jec ts  or l i ve  ones.  L ive ob jec ts  reproduce themse lves  auto -  
nomously. L ive ob jec ts  are o rgan ic  ind iv idua ls  or  a r t i f i c ia l  
ones.  Organic ind iv idua ls  are  one-ce l lu la r  or  mu l t i - ce l lu la r .  
They are a lso  heterot roph ic  ( they  consume organ ic  ob jec ts )  or  
autot roph ic  ( they  consume anorgan ic  ob jec ts  on ly ) .  Mu l t i - ce l l -  
u la r  autot roph ic  organ ic  ind iv idua ls  are ca l led  p l~ts .  Mu l t i -  
ce l lu la r  heterot roph io  o rgan ic  ind iv idua ls  are  ca l led  sub teots .  
P lants  have no moving organs and no consc iousness .  They do 
not need them. Sub jec ts  have moving organs and consc iousness .  
They need them for  search ing ,  hunt ing  and escape.  Each sub- 
Jec ts  has genera l  knowledge database .  I t  conta ins  in fo rmat ion  
- 234 - 
about types of  scenes (ca l led  image-frames)  in the form the  
scenes are seen by the sub jec t  by i t s  eyes,  but in  a very  
s imp l i f i ed  form. I t  conta ins  a l so  sequences of  scenes (ca l led  
scener ies  ) represent ing  ru les  (ca l led  mgdus ponens ru les )  
accord ing  to  which changes in  the  un iverse  are rea l i zed .  Each 
sub jec t  has concrete  knowledge database represent ing  h i s to ry  
of  l i fe  of  the sub jec t  and image-frame of  ac tua l  scene~ Each 
sub jec t  const ruc ts  poss ib le  scenes and rea l i zes  program, ed 
behav iour  of  i t se l f .  Each sub, sot  has in fo rmat ion  process ing  
database mans~ament operat ion  system having both above data -  
bases in  long term memory ~nd process ing  ac tua l  knowledge in  
shor t  term memory. A sub jec t  i s  ca l led  human, i f  i t  i s  ab le  to  
descr ibe  scenes by means of  p rocesses  ( i .e .  to  decode image- 
- f rames in to  fo rmulu  (ca l led  c lauses)  represent ing  processes)  
and i f  i t  const ruc ts  ~ew c lauses  from the o ld ones by means 
of  modus ponens ru les  (ca l led  reasonS) .  Sub jec ts  wi th consc i -  
ousness wi thout  above proper t ies  are ca l led  an imals .  Humans 
operat ion  system for  in fo rmat ion  process ing  i s  ca l led  o e_~.e~-  
ion  log ic ,  humans c lauses  form & system ca l led  semantic  
language.  Humans have the ab i l i ty  to  exchange in fo rmat ion  
among themselves  by means of  c lauses  (such ac t iv i ty  i s  ca l led  
d i~o~) .  We have thus the fo l low ing  s tages  o f  in fo rmat ion  
process ing :  F i r s t  there  are anorganic  ob jec ts  on ly .  Then organ-  
i c  ob jec ts  appear by a random. Then by means of natura l  se lec t -  
ion one-cellular heterotrophie organic individuals (bacteria) 
appear. From bacteria one-cellular autotrophic organic individ- 
uals are developed (cyanoph?cae). Prom bacteria more sophlsti- 
c~ted one-cellular heterotrophic protozoa are developed and 
by symbiosis from protozoa and cyanop~vcae one-cellular auto- 
trophic al~ae appear. From algae plants are developed and from 
protozoa animals. From animals humans are developed (namely 
because of necessity of exchange information in social product- 
ion activities). 
(2) Semantic la~a~a~e clause. In each scene there are 
individuals (like TREE, JOHN, FEAR) and processes (like TO-GO, 
- 235 - 
TO-EXPLAIN). Names of individuals are called atomic individu- 
al__.ss (or nouns), names of processes are called verb__._~s. In each 
process participating individuals play Certain roles (called 
individual members) like (TO-GO WHO WITH-WHOM), (TO-EXPLAIN 
WHO WHAT TO-WHOM). Individuals have properties (like BLUE, 
EMPTY). Processes have properties (like QUICKLY, DAILY). Pro- 
pertiee of individuals are called attributes, properties of 
processes are called adverbs. Names of attributes are called 
atomic attributes (or adjectives), names of adverbs are call- 
ed atomic adverbs. There are several types of adverbs (called 
Bdverb ia l  .members), each of  them descr ibes  the c i rcumstances  
the  process  i s  rea l i zed .  The process  i s  rea l i zed  in  euc l idean  
three  d imensibnal  space (NHERE-PLACE,WHERE-NEAR, WHERE-FAR, 
~IERE-INSIDE, %~-/~E-OUTSIDE, ~CdF.~%E-BESIDE, WHERE-LEPT, WHERE- 
-HIGHT, V~RE-BEPORE, WHERE-BEHIND, WHERE-BELOW, WHERE-ABOVE, 
~-AROUND,  VP~ERE-A~ONG, ~/tEaRET~F~N, FROM, TO, VIA, 
DISTANCE) in linear time scale (WHEN-ANTERIORITY, WHEN-SIMUL- 
TANEITY, r~N-POSTERIORITY, BEGI~ING, END, FREQUENCY, DURAT- 
ION) under validity of several modus ponens rules (CAUSE, 
RESULT, PURPOSE, CONCESSION) with instruments (BY-MEANS-OF) 
and acoordinE to algorithm types (BY-~AT-WAY, INTENSITY, 
RESEMBLING). Hence we have (ATOMIC-INDIVIDUAL (ATTRIBUTE 
(K))K) for individuals (such form is called compound individ- 
ual) and (VERB ( INDIVIDUAL-~3ER(I)) I  (ADVERBIAL-MEM~ER(J))J) 
for processes i.e. for clauses. Modus ponens rules are of the 
form (IF CLAUSES THEN CLAUSES). Individual can be atomic indi- 
vidual, compound individual, process-as-individual clause, 
meta-level clause. Adverb can be atomic adverb, individual, 
adverb-defining clause. Attribute can be atomic attribute, 
individual, attribute-defining clause. To each clause some 
information about the whole clause belongs (called clause 
parameters). Individual members and adverbial members are 
called clause members . Hence we have (VERB CLAUSE-MEMBERS 
CLAUSE-PARAMETERS) ?

(3)  C lause Dar~neters .  
(a)  Conte~tuat i t  ~. Because of  ex is tence  of shor t  te rm 
memory one must d i s t ingu ish  in  each c lause  the  o ld  knowledge 
(ca l led  top ic )  and the  new one (ca l led  focus)  rece iv ing  thus  
either (TOPIC-VERB TOPIC-CLAUSE-HEMBERS FOCUS-CLAUSE-M~BERS) 
or  (POCUS-VERB TOPIC-CLAUSE-MEmBERS POOUS-CLAUSE-~Y~S) .  
(b)  Tense- Because ind iv idua ls ,  adverbs  and a t t r ibutes  
can be c lauses ,  we have fo r  each c lause  a graph  t ree  w i th  
clauses as vertices and to-be-superior-clause-of as edges. 
One needs only relative binary time relations (anteriority, 
simultaneity, posteriority). We consider time of construction 
of the clause and time of clause process realization. Time of 
construction of meta-level clause is the time of process real- 
ization of the superior clause. Time of construction of clause 
of o ther  types  i s  the  t ime of  const ruct ion  of  i t s  super io r  
c lause  (o r  in  the  case  of  top  c lause  - the  t ime of  send ing  i t  
by sender ) .  Other  b inar~ t ime re la t ions  ( i f  needed)  can be 
g iven  by t ime adverbs .  
(c)  Quant i f ie rs .  The s imples t  way in  us ing  quant i f ie rs  
i s  to  have on ly  ALL and SOME wi th  a reas  g iven  in  a t t r ibutes .  
(d)  ~ot~ The negat ion  i s  used on ly  in  bu i ld ing  scenes :  
We have o ld  knowledge about  scene .  We expect  new knowledge.  
We add new knowledge.  We negate  expected  but  unt rue  knowledge.  
Prom th is  we have the  fo l low ingz  e i ther  we negate  new expected  
focus  ( i .e .  focus  w i th  or  w i thout  verb)  o r  we negate  top ic  
verb  on ly .  
(e)  Aspect  s i te ra t ivness  I ex tens ion  m process  rea l i za t i~:  
Each process  accord ing  to  i t s  completness  can be COMPLETED or  
NOT-COMPLETED, according to its iterativness REPEATED or NOT- 
-REPEATED, according to its relation to ~a certain time moment 
I~ IATE  or EXTENDED and according to its realization 
REAL-PROCESS, UNREAL-PROCESS-POSSIBLE-SCENE-DEFINING or UNREAL- 
-PROCESS-POSSIBLE-SCENE-NOT-DEFINING.

(f) Sub.jective modalit~: (CERTAINTY: I know that CLAUSE), 
(HOPE: I suppose that CLAUSE), (INDETER~INATION: I don't know 
that CLAUSE), (DOUBT: I suppose that NOT-CLAUSE), (NEGATION: 
I know that NOT-CLAUSE). 
(g) Emotlonalit2: (OBJECTIVITY: I am indifferent to 
realize CLAUSE), (PLEASURE: I want CLAUSE, I know that CLAUSE), 
(LONGING: I want CLAUSE, I suppose that CLAUSE), (FEAR: i want 
CLAUSE, I suppose that NOT-CLAUSE), (ANGER: I want CLAUSE, 
I know that NOT-CLAUSE, It is CLAUSE(~) if NOT-CLAUSE, I don't 
want CLAUSE( 1 ), It is NOT-CLAUSE( I ) if NOT-CLAUSE and CLAUSE 
(2), I strive to realize CLAUSE(2)), (REGRET: dtto like for 
anger but I don't strive to realize CLAUSE(2)). 
(h) Oblective modalit2: 
(NECESSITY-WITH-SOURCE-AGENT) : Agent A is indifferent to 
CLAUSE" A realizes CLAUSE(I) if NOT-CLAUSE, A doesn't want 
CLAUSE( I ) ), 
(NECESSITY-WITH-SOURCE-NON-AGENT: Non-agent B is superior to 
A, B realizes CLAUSE(1) if A doesn't realize CLAUSE, B 
wants CLAUSE, A is indifferent to CLAUSE, A doesn't want 
CLAUSE(1), B appeals to A to realize CLAUSE), 
(NECESSITY-WITH-SOURCE-ENVIROI~ENTAL-CIRCUMSTANCES: A is in- 
different to CLAUSE, One realizes CLAUSE(1) if A doesn't 
realize CLAUSE, A doesn't want CLAUSE(1)), 
(NECESSITY-WITH-SOME-SOURCE: At least one type of necessity 
'is given), 
(PO~IBILITY-WITH-SOURCE-AGENT: Inner circumstances of A are 
complete for CLAUSE), 
(POSSIBILITY-WITH-SOURCE-NON-AGENT: B is superior to A, B 
agrees to realize CLAUSE, B realizes CLAUSE(1) if A real- 
izes CLAUSE and B doesn't agree to realize CLAUSE, A 
doesn't want CLAUSE(I ) ), 
( POSSIBILITY-WITH-S OURCE-ENVIRONMENTAL -CIRCUMSTANCES : Environ- 
mental circumstances are complete for CLAUSE), 
(POSSIBILITY-WITH-ALL-SOURCES: All types of possibilities are 
- 238 - 
given), 
(WILL-WITH-SOURCE-AGENT: A wants CLAUSE, A strives to realize 
CLAUSE). 
Objective modelity = n-th objective modality ((n-1)-th object- 
ive modality (... ( 1-th objective modality) ... ). 
(i) Global modalit2: INFORMATION, rIND-TRUTH-VALUE- 
-QUESTION, PIND-X-VALUE-QUESTION, COMMAND, PROHIBITION, RE- 
QUEST, ADVICE. 
(J) ~atabase position: VIEWPOINT. 
(4) Understandin~ . Clauses are grouped into role-pairs 
(WHY-ROLE-CLAUSE HOW-ROLE-CLAUSES), modus ponens rules, scenes 
and denote-clauses. Content of clauses is given by means of 
such grouping. It enables to operate with vague notions and 
even with contradictions. Each system, say S, is described by 
input and output of structures, energy and records, by struct- 
ures as means and records as database, by scenes and by role- 
-pairs, where wh~-roles are the roles being fulfilled by S and 
how-roles are why-roles of subsystems of S. Understanding of 
very large systems and semantic mathematical analysis of 
anthropoecoeystems is realized by the binary relation to-be- 
-subsystem-of defined by role-pairs on SYSTEM's. Example: 
(ROLE-PAIR(24): (WHY-ROLE: (TO-RECEIVE (WHO: IT) (WHAT: 
GLUCOSE))) (HOW-ROLE(1): (TO-REALIZE (WHO: IT) (WHAT: PHOTO- 
sn~sls)  ) ))
