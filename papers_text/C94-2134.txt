Abstract 
This pat)er t)resents ome techniques for selecting 
linguistically adequate hypol;heses of new gram- 
mat.foal knowledge to be used as resources of 
gralmnatical knowledge acquisition. In our frame- 
work of liuguistic knowledge acquisition, a rule- 
based hypothesis generator is inw)ked in case of 
parsing failures and all the possible hypotheses of 
Llew graliLlnar rules or lexical entries are gener- 
ated ffOln partial parsing results. Although each 
hypothesis could recover the (lef>cl, s of the exist- 
ing grammar, the greater part of hypotheses are 
linguistically unnatural. The techniques we pro- 
pose here prevent such unnatural hypotheses Dont 
being gene,'ated without discarding plausible ones 
and make the following corpus-based acquisition 
l)rocess In(ire ellieien(, and more reliable. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Reusability of existing linguistic knowledge is the most 
import,~mt requirement for the rapid development of 
pra.ctical nal, ural \]augtlage l)rocessing systems. In or- 
der to realize, automatic ustomizatiou of existing lin- 
guistic knowledge to each applicat;ion domain, we pro- 
posed a new approach of linguistic knowledge acquisi- 
tion, which is a combination of symbolic and statistical 
approaches \[Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993\]. 
The fi:amework of our al)proach is shown in Figure 1. 
'1'111". acquisilion flow starl;s with executing the l)arse of 
each sentence in a corpus. If parsing lhiled, |,he 'tiy- 
poi;hesis Generator' produces the hyl)otheses of addi- 
tional gramnu~tical knowh;dge, each of which could re- 
cover t;lle incompleteness of the existing grammar Af- 
ter iterating t;his hypothesis generation process for all 
the senten('es in the corpus, the hypotheses are passed 
to the statistical analysis procc.ss and finally plausible 
hypotheses are chosen as new knowh'.dge by observing 
statistical properties of tile hypotheses. 
Unlike robusl; parsing \[Mellish, 1989; Goeser, 1992; 
l)ouglas and I)ale, 1 !)92\] or nou-statisl.ical ll)roach for 
grallunar a(:lluisil;ioll , our al/proach does Ilol; require 
a mechanism to detect tile cause of the parsing fail-- 
ure in the sentencial analysis phase and therefore the 
'Ilypothesis (~eneral;or' may output ;111 I,he possible hy- 
potheses, l\[owever, the greater part 1)t' hypotheses gen- 
erated by a simple deductive mechanism are unnatural

the input string of words might be hypol,hesize(I.

Linguistically unnatural hypqtheses have harnfful et: 
fects on lille lbllowing corpus-based process, not only 
making the process inefficient but, also int, erl'ering wil, ll 
statistical dnl, a as noise. In this paper, some techniques 
to remove such inadequate hytml, heses are proposed 
and the results of exl)eriments which show the efl'ec- 
l.iwme.ss of the proposed techniques are also discussed. 
2 Grammar Hypothes iz ing  
2.1 Grammar Formal i sm 
The grammar lbrlnalisnl we use is a conventional 
uniIication-based grammar. F, ach gramLnar rule is 
written in the form of a combination of a conl, ext-free 
rule and feature unilication functions. This R)rmalism 
is not specitic to any linguistic ~;heory, but we inl.ro- 
duced a number of concepts widely accepted in lil,- 
guisl, ic theories, such as grammatical f mctions, sub- categorization |'ralLies, aim X-bar theory. 
'FILe parsing system we introdttced 1,11 allply our 
grammar lbrlnalism is a sysl,enl called SAX \[Mat- 
smnoto, 1986\]. SAX uses the concepts of act, iw~' and 
inactive edges of Chart P~lrsing and analyses an in- 
put sentence with a bottom-up and parallel algoril;hm. 
As the grammar hyl)othesiziLLg algorithm is supposed 
l:o refer partial parsiug results of unsuccessflflly parsed 
sentences, we slightly modified SAX so that it ou/.lmts 
inactive edges as partial parsing results. 
837 
2.2 Basic  Algor i thm 
When SAX fails to parse a sentence, no inactive edge 
of category 5' sl/anning the whole sentencc exists in the 
parsing result. Grammar tlypothesizing is a process to 
introduce this inactive edge by augnlentmg the current 
gramnmr. The basic part of the hypothesis generation 
algorithm is written as fbllows: 
\ [Algor i thm\]  An inactive edge lie(A) : a:o, '%1 Ca l l  be 
introduced from x0 to x,~, with label A, by each of 
the \]lypotheses generated by the following two steps. 
\[Step 1\] For each sequence of inactive edges, 
lie(B1): :r0,Xl\] , . . . ,  \[ie(Bn) : .Vn_l,a:n\], spanning 
from x0 to x~, generates a yew rule. 
A :=> /31 , - . . ,B  n 
\[Step 2\] For each existing rule A -~ A I , . . . ,An ,  
find an ineonlplete sequence of inactive edges, 
lie(A1) : x0,xl\], . . . ,  \[ie(Ai_l) : xi-~,Xi_l\], 
\[ie(Ai+l ) :  :ci, .r:i+l\] . . . .  , \[ie(A,) : :,:,,_~, x,~\], and 
call this algorithm ibr \[ie(Ai) : xi-1, .vii. 
Feature  Structures: A rule generated in \[Step 1\] 
could be a lexieal entry when this top-down algorithm 
reaches the bottom. As we adopted a unification- 
based grmnmar fbrmalism, we extended the algorithm 
so thai, it can hyt)othesize a feature structure of a lex- 
ical entry by observing surrounding successful cate- 
gories. As the algorithm works even ibr a eOml)lex 
feature like a subcategorization frame, it can be used 
to acquire a subeategorization dictionary. While some 
previous works on subcategorization fi'alne acquisition 
assumed very little prior knowledge concerning the 
classification of subcategorization frames \[Brent, 1991; 
Manning, 1993\], our apllroach assumes the existence 
of grammar rules Sllecifying subcategorization fi'ame 
assignment, which enables more accurate learning of 
subcategorization frames. 
Mult iple Defects: In \[Step 2\] of the algorithm, it 
is SUl)t)osed that each unsuccessfully parsed sentence 
has exactly one cause of failure but a sentmtee in actual 
texts often contains two or more causes of failure (for 
example, two unknown words). To solve this problem, 
we extended the algorithm so that it searches for a 
multiple hypothesis which is a set of rewriting rules 
and lexlcal entries. 
3 Hypothes is  Se lect ion  
3.1 Bas ic  Grammat ica l  Const ra in ts  
From a linguistic point of view, hypotheses generated 
by the algorithnl given above might contain nlany un- 
natural hypotheses because the algorithm itself does 
not have any linguistic knowledge to judge the appro- 
priateness of hypotheses. To remove unnatural hy- 
potheses, we have introduced the following criteria 
\[Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993\]. 
? The maximum number of adjacent unsuccessful cat- 
egories is set to 2 in order not to decrease the efIi- 
ciency of the algorithm. 
? The lnaxilnuln nulnber of daughter nodes is set to 3. 
? Supl)osing that the existing grammar contains all 
the category conversion rules, a mmry rule which 
has only one daughter node is not generate.d. 
? Using generalizations embodied ill the existing 
grammar, a hypothesis contaiuing a sequence of 
subnodes which are collected into a larger category 
by existing grammar ules is not generated. 
? Distinguishing non-lexieal categories from lexica.l 
categories, a hypothesis whose mother category is 
a lexical category is not generated. 
? Assuming that tile existing gramznar has a complete 
set of fllnctional words, a lexical hypothe~sis i  re- 
stricted to the open lexical categories, uch as noun, 
verb, adjective, and adverb 
3.2 Const ra in t  based on /meal  Boundar ies  
A new constraint on the violation of the boundary 
condition given to phrases was introduced to avoid 
any collection of adja/:ent successfifl categories in rule 
hypothesizing. The bomnlary condition is given by 
putting parentheses at both ends of a phrase, such 
as a noun phrase, a verb l)hrase, and a prelmsitional 
phrase. This constraint ilters out a hylmthesis which 
crosses either end, not both ends, of a phrase. For 
example, when parentheses are put like "\[Tile default 
blocking factor\] is \[20 blocks\]", a hyl)othesis 'VP ='e 
VP, NP, VE'R.BBIs"' covering "blocking factor is" is 
discarded because of the violation of the boumlary con 
dition of a noun phrase "The defimlt blocking factor" 
This constraint requires the hunlan task of putting 
parentheses before the hypothesis generator is invoked. 
hi comparison with writing a constituent structure of 
tile whole sentence, this work is much easier because 
we have only to give parentheses to delinite phrases. 
Moreover, instead of giving parentheses by hand, we 
can even obtain various tagged corpora. 
As this constraint is also atlplieable to other con- 
stituents of the input sentence, it might improve the 
etliciency of the top-down hypothesizing algorith m. 
3.3 Const ra in t  based on X-bar  Theory  
Most of the criteria in 3.1 are based on linguis- 
tic category classification but none of them com- 
mits itself to dealing with the rcla.tionship among the 
nlother node and the daughter nodes. For example, 
supposing the existing granmmr does not contain a 
rule for participial adjuncts  ill t10UU phrases, the hy- 
pothesizing program generates a new rewriting rule 
'NP ~. VP, NP '  t?om the phrase "blocking tactor" 
in the sentence "The default blocking factor is 20 
blocks". Ilowever, tile program also general,es other 
alternative hyt)otheses from the same phrase, such as 
'PP ~ VP, NP',  ' INFINIg' IVI '~ ~ VP, NP',  and 
'THAT_CLAUS' I , /~ VP, NP',  each of which derives 
a. 1lost-positional adjunct for "default" by believing 
"default" is a head noun of the noun phrase. Liuguisli- 
cally, such combinations of nlother nodes and daughter 
nodes are not allowed. 
As a general )rinciple for explaining phrase struc- 
tures, X-bar lheoryis widely accepted. According to 
X-bar theory, a grannnar ule is (or can be converted 
to) either of the following forlns, where each prime(') 
expresses the l)rojection level of' a head X. The l)rojec - 
tion level increases as gramnlar ules are applied and 
X" is called a maa:imal projection of that category. U 
and W are adjuncts of X' and should I)e maximal pro 
jeetions of some ca.tegories.

The weighting function explained ill 3.4 was not 
used for selecting hypotheses but tim validity of it was 
proved by counting the order of each plausible hypoth- 
esis in the set of generated hypotheses. The row of 
'Rank of Plausible IIypotheses' in Table 3 indicates 
that plausible hypotheses stand much higher than the 
middle of the order. 
ExamI) les:  IIereafter, in order to show how hy- 
potheses were selected by each constraint, we explain 
tile results for some typical examples. 
Ex.1) "The default blocking factor is 20 blocks." 
As Grammar A does not contain a rule for participial 
adjuncts, the parser fails to analyse the noun phrase 
"tile det~ult blocking fact, of '  and the grammar hy- 
pothesizing program is iuvoked. While this program 
generates 21 hypotlmses in experiment (a), it filters 
out the following 12 hypotheses in experiment (b). 
While checking local boundary violation, the pro- 
gram removes those grammatically unnatural com- 
binations of categories, though it does not use any 
linguistic knowledge. 
New Rule: advp => np,vp. 
New Rule: infinitive => np,Vpo 
New Rule: infinitive => vp,np,vp. 
New Rule; np => s,vp,np. 
New Rule: np=> vp,np,vpo 
New Rule: pp => np,vp. 
New Rule: pp => vp,np,vp. 
New Rule: that_clause => vp,np,vpo 
New Rule: vp => vp,np,auxbe. 
New Rule: vp --> vp,np,s. 
New Rule: vppsv => vp,np,auxbe. 
New Rule: vppsv => vp,np,vp. 
Moreover, the l)rogram filters otlt (;lie following 4 
llypothese with tile constraint of X-bar theory. 
New Rule: infinitive => vp,npo 
New Rule: pp => vp,np. 
New Rule: that clause => vp,np~ 
New Rule: vppsv => vp,np. 
Finally, the fol\]owing 5 l~ypotheses, alnong which the 
expected hypothesis 'NI '=> VP, N I "  still remains 
are generate.d 
Modified Lexical Entry: n => \[factor\]. 
New Lexical Entry: adv => \[factor\]  
New Lexical Entry: n => \[blocking\]. 
New Rule; np => vp,np. 
New Rule: np => s,vp,np.

ble hypothesis obtained in search of the real cause 
of the feature disagreement between "capable" and 
"of backsl~aeiug". This lexical hypothesis for "capa 
hie" contains a modified version of its subcategoriza- 
lion frame so that it subcategorizes @prepositional 
phrase.

? The newly introduced COllstraiuls reduce the nmn- 
bet of hypotheses per sentence, from 26.0 1;o only 
5.6, small enough to be treal;ed in a corpus-based 
processing enviromnent. This hyl~othesis selection 
is done without discarding plausilAe hypotheses. Al- 
though, all the initial hypotheses may be, in certain 
cases~ removed by the lle.W constraints, this hapl)ens 
only if no plansilAe hyl)othesis is inch,tied iu the ini

This fact amahs l;hat the. grammar used R)r the ex- 
perilnents has an almost sullieient set of rewriting 
rules and that, after t;he grammar reaches such a 
mature situat;ion during the acquisition cycle, only 
lexieal or idiosyncratic knowledge has to be added. 
As our method has a facility to hypothesize a lexical 
entry with it, s l~;aI, ure structure including a subcate- 
gorization frame, we can set the target of acquisition 
only to lexieal knowledge for a large dictionary.
