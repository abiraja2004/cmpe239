The psper presents  a conceptual  frs~ework fo r  natura l  
lan~age ana lys i s  w i th in  which some exper iments were held and 
some ideas  had been developed.  
The work concerns the means of t rans la t ion  of natura l  
language text  in to  i t s  meaning repreeantat ion  in  form of 
semantic  network bas ing  on f rwnes? fo~ns?1~.  The expex~ment~ 
used Russian as 1spur language. 
I. The analysls is essentially vocabulary driven. Semant- 
to  lnfox~attor-  I s  In tens ive ly  used; indeed,  the formal ism 
does not make much d i f fe rence  between grammar and sanant?oe,  
I% could be regarded as a Genera l i zed syntax. ,  The approach 
leads  tO d i s t r ibut ion  of words In to  c lasses  qu i te  d i f fe rent

Lexle vocabularies.

The vocabu lary  a r t i c le  conta ins  the fo l low ing :  
a) a re fe rence  to supernot ion!  a l l  i n fo rmat ion  from 
supernot ion  i s  re levant  to ac tua l  not ion ,  i f  i t  i sn ' t  exp l i c i t -  
l y  euperoeded.  The "not ion -supernot ion"  re la t ion  imposes 
h ie rarch ica l  s t ruc ture  on the set  of  not ions .  
b) a l i s t  o f  the not ion 's  a t t r ibutes  w i th  cor responding 
Genera l i zed  Syntact i c  Re la t ions  (GSR). The set  o f  a l l  GSRs 
forms the Eralmar used in  an~ys is .  The GSR at tached  to a t t r ib -  
u te  must hold fo r  the words (o r  phrases)  of  the NL text ,  the 
f i r s t  (master)  re fe r r ing  an ins tance  of  the not ion ,  the second 
(s lave)  re fe r r ing  to  the a t t r ibute  va lue .  E .g .  fo r -Russ ian ,  
the ~RECEI~ENT at t r ibute  of  ~GIVE would have a GSR demanding 
the  s lave  to be an ins tance  of  ~PF~SON and to have the form of 
Dat ive  case.  (The do l la r  s ign  i s  used to d i s t in~n~sh not ions  
from words. )
The a t t r ibutes  inher i ted  from supernot ion  may a lso  have 
a spec i f i ca t ion  of  de fau l t  or  f i xed  va lue ,  which i s  immediate-  
l y  inser ted  in to  meaning representat ion .  
2 .2 .  The Lexio Vocabulary conta ins  words. Words can be 
s i~ ican% or  aux i l i a ry .  S ign i f i cant  words are those ,  which 
name not ions ,  a t t r ibutes  or  a t t r ibutes  va lues .  A l l  o ther  words 
are au~l ia ry~ they  are t reated  as components of  ana ly t i c  
morpho log ica l  forms and are processed by prescan.  There fore  
only  s i~f i cant  words are present  in  the vocabu lary .  
Lexio Vocabulary article conta ins :  
a) a re fe rence  to Semantic Vocabulary w i th  ind icat ion  
of  the ro le  c l~s  (not ionPn~e,  a t t r ibute -n~ne tc . ,  see 
below) and, opt iona l ly ,  a lex ica l  funct ion  (see  /1 / )o  
b) ~ammat ica l  a t t r ibutes  of  the word: grammar c lass ,  
morpho lo~ca l  pat te rn ,  f i xed  grammatical  va lues  (such as gend- 
e r  fo r  nouns, aspect  fo r  verbs ,  e tc . ) .

Lex ic  Vocabulary or  prov ided by presoan,  a t t r ibutes  i nher i ted  
by s lave from supernot ion or a t t r ibutes  values re f lec t ing  the 
meaning of  the text .  The most usual ce~es invo lve  matohin 8
s lave+s grammatical  a t t r ibutes  to  some g iven  va lues  or  to  
those  o f  master ,  and demand fo r  s lave  to  re fe r  a subnot ion  of  
a g iven  not ion .  However some GSRs are  more soph is t i ca ted .  
3 .1 .  The grammar par t  o f  GSRs has much in  common wi th  
Surface Syntactical Relations (3SR) of /1/. Indeed the GSRs 
had been insp i r i ted  by SSRs. 
GSRs differ from SSRs in two aspectsz first, they system- 
atioally use semantic information! second, GSRs usually deal 
with a deeper syntax level! e,g, if the grammar part of GSR 
postu la tes  a "d i rec t -ob jec t  re la t ion" ,  i t s  descr ip t ion  may 
cover  ac t ive  and pass ive  verba l ,  par t i c ip ia l  and nominal 
oonst ruc t ionsz" t0  wr i te  a le t te r " ,  "a le t te r  i s  wr i t ten" ,  
" the  le t te r  wr i t ten  by . . . "  and "wr i t t ing  a le t te r " .  
3 .2 .  However, the GSR teohniq~e a l lows d i f fe rent  ~ye . to  
descr ibe  a f ra~nent  o f  language~ a l l  depends on the a t t r ibutes  
tes ted .  Making the 6ran~ar par t  of  GSRs t r iv ia l ,  one rec ieves  
a pure semantic  ~asmar .  On the o ther  hand, i f  the set  o f  
not ions  i s  the set  o f  grammatical  c lasses ,  GSR~based ana lys i s  
tu rns  in to  t rad i t iona l  syntax  ana lys i s .  
3 .3 .  When NL text  has been t ransformed in to  a se t  of  
p roper ty  l i s t s ,  fe tched  from the  vocabu lar ies  and augmented by 
morpholog ica l  preeoan,  there  are many ways to o rder  the app l i c -  
a t ion  of  the re levant  GSRs, fo r ,  wh i le  each GSR i s  descr ibed  
procedura l ly ,  the descr ip t ion  as a whole i s  dec la ra t ive .  In  
our  exper iments a s impl i f i ca t ion  of  the pars ing  a lgor i thm 
descr ibed  in  /2 /  was used.  
4 .1 .  The out l ined  approach demands a c lass i f i ca t ion  of  
words d i f fe rent  from one based on grammatical  c lasses .  
S ign i f i cant  words are devided in to  c lasses  depending on 
the  ro le  they  p lay  in  n~ing  cor responding not ions .  We d ie t ing -  
-51-,. 
u ish  four  main c lasses  - N, A?, A and SA. 
C lass  N i8  the la rgest ;  i t  i s  comprised by words which 
name not ionB,  ins tances  of  not ions  and venues fo r  some at t r ib -  
u tes .  This c lass  covers  most nouns, verbs ,  verb ia l  ad~ect ives  
and numerals .  I t  a l so  conta ins  a smal l  but very  important  
subc lass  of  pronouns.  
C lass  AV i s  formed by words, na~ng at t r ibute  together  
w i th  i t s  va lue .  This c lass  covers  most ad jec t ives  and adverbs .  
C lass A cons is ts  of  words naming a t t r ibutes .  Usua l ly  
they  are nounso 
Example: 
The fol lowAng words re fe r  the same not ion  ~FLIGHT in  
d i f fe rent  ways: " to  f l y " ,  " f l ight " ,  " f l y ln~ ~ust name i t  and 
a~e of  the c lass  N; '~peed" i s  an example of  c lass  A, i t  nsmee 
an a t t r ibute  o f  ~FLIGHT! "qu ick  e and wquAckly" re fe r  to  the  
same at t r ibute ,  but p rov ide  a v~ue (Magn) fo r  i t ,  these  two 
are  the me~.ber o f  c lass  A?. 
"Simple s to r ies"  use most ly  N and AV. The words of  
c lass  A are  common in  NL-aocess to  data -basses  
4.2oThe four th  c lass  i s  formed by Subetant iona l  A t t r i -  
butes  (SA). As a mat ter  o f  fac t ,  the i r  d i scuss ion  was the  
main mot ivat ion  to wr i te  th i s  paper.  The separat ion  of  i t  
from other  c lasses  makes i t  poss ib le  to  process  88 " l ingu is t -  
i o  e some text  r~ la t ions  usua l ly  t reated  as "semant ic  e and 
requ i r ing  some deduct ive  system to process  them. 
Subetant iona l  A t t r ibutes  combine the proper t ies  of  the 
o ther  th ree  c lasses .  They name at t r ibute ,  prov ide  i t s  va lue  
but focus ize  on an ob jec t  - the a t t r ibute  *s va lue .  E.K. "ca -  
p i ta l "  names an a t t r ibute  o f  ~OUNTRY, but the focus i8  nor  
count ry  ne i ther  ~he a t t r ibute~name but an ins tance  of  ~CITY. 
n a t t r ibute  has ,  so to say,  i t s  own substant ion  
' l y  separated  from the master .  
- 52  - 
Indeed,  un l i ke  a t t r ibutes  of  c lass  A, Subetant iona l  
A t t r ibutes  may be used wi thout  exp l i c i t  re fe rence  to i t s  
master :  e ,g ,  " the  t ra in  goes to the cap i te?" .  I f  the master  
i s  p resent ,  the master -s lave  re la t ion  need not to  be express -  
ed syntact i ca l l y :  
"Peter  ~ave the so.._nn an app le . "  
T rad i t iona l  syntax ignores  the posess ive  l ink  between 
sub jec t  ( "Peter" )  and ob jec t  ( "son" )  in  th i s  phrase;  nor  does 
i t  cons ider  the prev ious  one incomplete .  
Our GSR-grannnar c la ims the presence o f  anaphora in  
these  phrases .  ~he f i r s t  conta ins  an unreso lved  reverence  to 
some country!  in  the second one the word "son" inc ludes  a 
re fe rence  to some "parent" ,  the most probably - Peter  ( i .e .  
the denotat  of  "Peter" ) .  
Def iu i  t ion :  
A word i s  Substant ia l  A t t r ibute  i f  i t  re fe rs  an ob jec t  
by naming i t s  re la t ion  to some other  ob jec t  or  s i tuat ion .  
In  text  Substant iona l  A t t r ibute  ac t fas  i f  i t  were bound 
by posese ive  re la t ion  to a "v i r tua l  pronoun" of  appropr ia te  
semantic  c lass .  For example, these  two phrases can be yiewed 
8~ 
and 
"The t ra in  goes to the cap i ta l  Eo f -count ry"  
"Peter  gave hi_.ss son an apple"  
In  the f i r s t  phrase "1o f -count ry"  s tands fo r  such a 
"v i r tua l  pronoun".  In  the second one, "v i r tua l  pronoun" occas -  
iona l ly  turned to be a rea l  one; whi le  in  Eng l i sh  i t s  use i s  
qu i te  natura l ,  in  Russian the use of  posess ive  pronoun would 
have an emphatic meaning. 
The anaphora reso lu t ion  fo r  such "v i r tua l  pronouns" 
iS done in  the same way as fo r  rea l  ( lex ica l l y  expressed)  pro -  
nouns. However, i t  i s  poss ib le  to take benef i t  of  the fac t ,  
- 53  - 
that  "v i r tua l  pronoun" re fers  an ins tance  of spec i f ied  not ion ,  
whi le fo r  rea l  pronoun only  grammatical  va lues  ere known. 
Another example: 
"President and wife came to capital" 
(Articles and pronouns ere dropped to reflect Russian), 
This phrase is processed as 
"President roof-country with xhis wife came to capital Eof- 
country". 
Indeed the wife i s  the wife of th i s  p res ident ,  and they 
came to the c i ty ,  which i s  the cap i ta l  of the count ry  of which 
he i s  the pres ident .  To in fe r  th i s  from the phrase no ext ra -  
-linguistic deduction is needed. 
4.3 ,  The experiments have shown, that treating SAs as 
two words: one refering an object and another a "virtual pro- 
noun", is helpful in analysis oriented on extraction of mean- 
Ing of the text. In fact It deals with a more general question 
of the limits between "language knowledge" and "knowledge of 
world".
