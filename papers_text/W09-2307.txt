Abstract
The prevalence in Chinese of grammatical
structures that translate into English in dif-
ferent word orders is an important cause of
translation difficulty. While previous work has
used phrase-structure parses to deal with such
ordering problems, we introduce a richer set of
Chinese grammatical relations that describes
more semantically abstract relations between
words. Using these Chinese grammatical re-
lations, we improve a phrase orientation clas-
sifier (introduced by Zens and Ney (2006))
that decides the ordering of two phrases when
translated into English by adding path fea-
tures designed over the Chinese typed depen-
dencies. We then apply the log probabil-
ity of the phrase orientation classifier as an
extra feature in a phrase-based MT system,
and get significant BLEU point gains on three
test sets: MT02 (+0.59), MT03 (+1.00) and
MT05 (+0.77). Our Chinese grammatical re-
lations are also likely to be useful for other
NLP tasks.
1 Introduction
Structural differences between Chinese and English
are a major factor in the difficulty of machine trans-
lation from Chinese to English. The wide variety
of such Chinese-English differences include the or-
dering of head nouns and relative clauses, and the
ordering of prepositional phrases and the heads they
modify. Previous studies have shown that using syn-
tactic structures from the source side can help MT
performance on these constructions. Most of the
previous syntactic MT work has used phrase struc-
ture parses in various ways, either by doing syntax-
directed translation to directly translate parse trees
into strings in the target language (Huang et al,
2006), or by using source-side parses to preprocess
the source sentences (Wang et al, 2007).
One intuition for using syntax is to capture dif-
ferent Chinese structures that might have the same

however, have the same typed dependencies shown at the
bottom of the figure.
meaning and hence the same translation in English.
But it turns out that phrase structure (and linear or-
der) are not sufficient to capture this meaning rela-
tion. Two sentences with the same meaning can have
different phrase structures and linear orders. In the
example in Figure 1, sentences (a) and (b) have the
same meaning, but different linear orders and dif-
ferent phrase structure parses. The translation of
sentence (a) is: ?In the past three years these mu-
nicipalities have collectively put together investment
in fixed assets in the amount of 12 billion yuan.? In
sentence (b), ?in the past three years? has moved its
51
position. The temporal adverbial ??#u? (in the
past three years) has different linear positions in the
sentences. The phrase structures are different too: in
(a) the LCP is immediately under IP while in (b) it
is under VP.
We propose to use typed dependency parses in-
stead of phrase structure parses. Typed dependency
parses give information about grammatical relations
between words, instead of constituency informa-
tion. They capture syntactic relations, such as nsubj
(nominal subject) and dobj (direct object) , but also
encode semantic information such as in the loc (lo-
calizer) relation. For the example in Figure 1, if we
look at the sentence structure from the typed depen-
dency parse (bottom of Figure 1), ??#u? is con-
nected to the main verb q? (finish) by a loc (lo-
calizer) relation, and the structure is the same for
sentences (a) and (b). This suggests that this kind
of semantic and syntactic representation could have
more benefit than phrase structure parses.
Our Chinese typed dependencies are automati-
cally extracted from phrase structure parses. In En-
glish, this kind of typed dependencies has been in-
troduced by de Marneffe and Manning (2008) and
de Marneffe et al (2006). Using typed dependen-
cies, it is easier to read out relations between words,
and thus the typed dependencies have been used in
meaning extraction tasks.
We design features over the Chinese typed depen-
dencies and use them in a phrase-based MT sys-
tem when deciding whether one chunk of Chinese
words (MT system statistical phrase) should appear
before or after another. To achieve this, we train a
discriminative phrase orientation classifier follow-
ing the work by Zens and Ney (2006), and we use
the grammatical relations between words as extra
features to build the classifier. We then apply the
phrase orientation classifier as a feature in a phrase-
based MT system to help reordering.
2 Discriminative Reordering Model
Basic reordering models in phrase-based systems
use linear distance as the cost for phrase move-
ments (Koehn et al, 2003). The disadvantage of
these models is their insensitivity to the content of
the words or phrases. More recent work (Tillman,
2004; Och et al, 2004; Koehn et al, 2007) has in-
troduced lexicalized reordering models which esti-
mate reordering probabilities conditioned on the ac-
tual phrases. Lexicalized reordering models have
brought significant gains over the baseline reorder-
ing models, but one concern is that data sparseness
can make estimation less reliable. Zens and Ney
(2006) proposed a discriminatively trained phrase
orientation model and evaluated its performance as a
classifier and when plugged into a phrase-based MT
system. Their framework allows us to easily add in
extra features. Therefore we use it as a testbed to see
if we can effectively use features from Chinese typed
dependency structures to help reordering in MT.
2.1 Phrase Orientation Classifier
We build up the target language (English) translation
from left to right. The phrase orientation classifier
predicts the start position of the next phrase in the
source sentence. In our work, we use the simplest
class definition where we group the start positions
into two classes: one class for a position to the left of
the previous phrase (reversed) and one for a position
to the right (ordered).
Let c j, j? be the class denoting the movement from
source position j to source position j? of the next
phrase. The definition is:
c j, j? =
{ reversed if j? < j
ordered if j? > j
The phrase orientation classifier model is in the log-
linear form:
p?N1 (c j, j? | f J1 ,eI1, i, j)
= exp
(?Nn=1 ?nhn( f J1 ,eI1, i, j,c j, j?)
)
?c? exp
(?Nn=1 ?nhn( f J1 ,eI1, i, j,c?)
)
i is the target position of the current phrase, and f J1
and eI1 denote the source and target sentences respec-
tively. c? represents possible categories of c j, j? .
We can train this log-linear model on lots of la-
beled examples extracted from all of the aligned MT
training data. Figure 2 is an example of an aligned
sentence pair and the labeled examples that can be
extracted from it. Also, different from conventional
MERT training, we can have a large number of bi-
nary features for the discriminative phrase orienta-
tion classifier. The experimental setting will be de-
scribed in Section 4.1.

labeled examples for the phrase orientation classifier. Note that the alignment grid in this example is automatically
generated.
The basic feature functions are similar to what
Zens and Ney (2006) used in their MT experiments.
The basic binary features are source words within a
window of size 3 (d ? ?1,0,1) around the current
source position j, and target words within a window
of size 3 around the current target position i. In the
classifier experiments in Zens and Ney (2006) they
also use word classes to introduce generalization ca-
pabilities. In the MT setting it?s harder to incorpo-
rate the part-of-speech information on the target lan-
guage. Zens and Ney (2006) also exclude word class
information in the MT experiments. In our work
we will simply use the word features as basic fea-
tures for the classification experiments as well. As
a concrete example, we look at the labeled example
(i = 4, j = 3, j? = 11) in Figure 2. We include the
word features in a window of size 3 around j and i
as in Zens and Ney (2006), we also include words
around j? as features. So we will have nine word
features for (i = 4, j = 3, j? = 11):
Src?1:. Src0:?? Src1:?)
Src2?1:{ Src20: Src21:(
Tgt?1:already Tgt0:become Tgt1:a
2.2 Path Features Using Typed Dependencies
Assuming we have parsed the Chinese sentence that
we want to translate and have extracted the gram-
matical relations in the sentence, we design features
using the grammatical relations. We use the path be-
tween the two words annotated by the grammatical
relations. Using this feature helps the model learn
about what the relation is between the two chunks
of Chinese words. The feature is defined as follows:
for two words at positions p and q in the Chinese

sentence (p < q), we find the shortest path in the
typed dependency parse from p to q, concatenate all
the relations on the path and use that as a feature.
A concrete example is the sentences in Figure 3,
where the alignment grid and labeled examples are
shown in Figure 2. The glosses of the Chinese words
in the sentence are in Figure 3, and the English trans-
lation is ?Beihai has already become a bright star
arising from China?s policy of opening up to the out-
side world.? which is also listed in Figure 2.
For the labeled example (i = 4, j = 3, j? = 11),
we look at the typed dependency parse to find the
path feature between ?? and . The relevant
dependencies are: dobj(??, ?h), clf (?h, ()
and nummod( , ). Therefore the path feature is
PATH:dobjR-clfR-nummodR. We also use the direc-
tionality: we add an R to the dependency name if it?s
going against the direction of the arrow.
3 Chinese Grammatical Relations
Our Chinese grammatical relations are designed to
be very similar to the Stanford English typed depen-
dencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; de Marn-
effe et al, 2006).
3.1 Description
There are 45 named grammatical relations, and a de-
fault 46th relation dep (dependent). If a dependency
matches no patterns, it will have the most generic
relation dep. The descriptions of the 45 grammat-
ical relations are listed in Table 2 ordered by their
frequencies in files 1?325 of CTB6 (LDC2007T36).
The total number of dependencies is 85748, and
other than the ones that fall into the 45 grammatical
relations, there are also 7470 dependencies (8.71%
of all dependencies) that do not match any patterns,
and therefore keep the generic name dep.
3.2 Chinese Specific Structures
Although we designed the typed dependencies to
show structures that exist both in Chinese and En-
glish, there are many other syntactic structures that
only exist in Chinese. The typed dependencies we
designed also cover those Chinese specific struc-
tures. For example, the usage of ?{? (DE) is one
thing that could lead to different English transla-
tions. In the Chinese typed dependencies, there
are relations such as cpm (DE as complementizer)
or assm (DE as associative marker) that are used
to mark these different structures. The Chinese-
specific ??? (BA) construction also has a relation
ba dedicated to it.
The typed dependencies annotate these Chinese
specific relations, but do not directly provide a map-
ping onto how they are translated into English. It
becomes more obvious how those structures affect
the ordering when Chinese sentences are translated
into English when we apply the typed dependencies
as features in the phrase orientation classifier. This
will be further discussed in Section 4.4.
3.3 Comparison with English
To compare the distribution of Chinese typed de-
pendencies with English, we extracted the English
typed dependencies from the translation of files 1?
325 in the English Chinese Translation Treebank
1.0 (LDC2007T02), which correspond to files 1?325
in CTB6. The English typed dependencies are ex-
tracted using the Stanford Parser.
There are 116,799 total English dependencies,
and 85,748 Chinese ones. On the corpus we use,
there are 45 distinct dependency types (not includ-
ing dep) in Chinese, and 50 in English. The cov-
erage of named relations is 91.29% in Chinese and
90.48% in English; the remainder are the unnamed
relation dep. We looked at the 18 shared relations

Figure 3: A Chinese example sentence labeled with typed dependencies
between Chinese and English in Table 1. Chinese
has more nn, punct, nsubj, rcmod, dobj, advmod,
conj, nummod, attr, tmod, and ccomp while English
uses more pobj, det, prep, amod, cc, cop, and xsubj,
due mainly to grammatical differences between Chi-
nese and English. For example, some determiners
in English (e.g., ?the? in (1b)) are not mandatory in
Chinese:
(1a)??=/import and export/total value
(1b) The total value of imports and exports
In another difference, English uses adjectives
(amod) to modify a noun (?financial? in (2b)) where
Chinese can use noun compounds (???/finance?
in (2a)).
(2a)?u/Tibet??/finance?/system??/reform
(2b) the reform in Tibet ?s financial system
We also noticed some larger differences between
the English and Chinese typed dependency distribu-
tions. We looked at specific examples and provide
the following explanations.
prep and pobj English has much more uses of prep
and pobj. We examined the data and found three
major reasons:
1. Chinese uses both prepositions and postposi-
tions while English only has prepositions. ?Af-
ter? is used as a postposition in Chinese exam-
ple (3a), but a preposition in English (3b):
(3a)??/1997??/after
(3b) after 1997
2. Chinese uses noun phrases in some cases where
English uses prepositions. For example, ??
-? (period, or during) is used as a noun phrase
in (4a), but it?s a preposition in English.
(4a)??/1997t/to??/1998?- /period
(4b) during 1997-1998
3. Chinese can use noun phrase modification in
situations where English uses prepositions. In
example (5a), Chinese does not use any prepo-
sitions between ?apple company? and ?new
product?, but English requires use of either
?of? or ?from?.
(5a)?*??/apple companyc??/new product
(5b) the new product of (or from) Apple
The Chinese DE constructions are also often
translated into prepositions in English.
cc and punct The Chinese sentences contain more
punctuation (punct) while the English translation
has more conjunctions (cc), because English uses
conjunctions to link clauses (?and? in (6b)) while
Chinese tends to use only punctuation (?,? in (6a)).
(6a) YJ/these?=/city??/social?/economic
0/development??/rapid??0/local
?/economic"?/strength?/clearly
/enhance
(6b) In these municipalities the social and economic de-
velopment has been rapid, and the local economic
strength has clearly been enhanced
rcmod and ccomp There are more rcmod and
ccomp in the Chinese sentences and less in the En-
glish translation, because of the following reasons:
1. Some English adjectives act as verbs in Chi-
nese. For example, c (new) is an adjectival
predicate in Chinese and the relation between
c (new) and ?? (system) is rcmod. But
?new? is an adjective in English and the En-
glish relation between ?new? and ?system? is
amod. This difference contributes to more rc-
mod in Chinese.
(7a)c/new{/(DE)X=/verify and write off
(7b) a new sales verification system
2. Chinese has two special verbs (VC): 4 (SHI)
and ? (WEI) which English doesn?t use. For

conj There are more conj in Chinese than in En-
glish for three major reasons. First, sometimes one
complete Chinese sentence is translated into sev-
eral English sentences. Our conj is defined for two
grammatical roles occurring in the same sentence,
and therefore, when a sentence breaks into multiple
ones, the original relation does not apply. Second,
we define the two grammatical roles linked by the
conj relation to be in the same word class. However,
words which are in the same word class in Chinese
may not be in the same word class in English. For
example, adjective predicates act as verbs in Chi-
nese, but as adjectives in English. Third, certain con-
structions with two verbs are described differently
between the two languages: verb pairs are described
as coordinations in a serial verb construction in Chi-
nese, but as the second verb being the complement
56
of the first verb in English.
4 Experimental Results
4.1 Experimental Setting
We use various Chinese-English parallel corpora1
for both training the phrase orientation classifier, and
for extracting statistical phrases for the phrase-based
MT system. The parallel data contains 1,560,071
sentence pairs from various parallel corpora. There
are 12,259,997 words on the English side. Chi-
nese word segmentation is done by the Stanford Chi-
nese segmenter (Chang et al, 2008). After segmen-
tation, there are 11,061,792 words on the Chinese
side. The alignment is done by the Berkeley word
aligner (Liang et al, 2006) and then we symmetrized
the word alignment using the grow-diag heuristic.
For the phrase orientation classifier experiments,
we extracted labeled examples using the parallel
data and the alignment as in Figure 2. We extracted
9,194,193 total valid examples: 86.09% of them are
ordered and the other 13.91% are reversed. To eval-
uate the classifier performance, we split these exam-
ples into training, dev and test set (8 : 1 : 1). The
phrase orientation classifier used in MT experiments
is trained with all of the available labeled examples.
Our MT experiments use a re-implementation of
Moses (Koehn et al, 2003) called Phrasal, which
provides an easier API for adding features. We
use a 5-gram language model trained on the Xin-
hua and AFP sections of the Gigaword corpus
(LDC2007T40) and also the English side of all the
LDC parallel data permissible under the NIST08
rules. Documents of Gigaword released during the
epochs of MT02, MT03, MT05, and MT06 were
removed. For features in MT experiments, we in-
corporate Moses? standard eight features as well as
the lexicalized reordering features. To have a more
comparable setting with (Zens and Ney, 2006), we
also have a baseline experiment with only the stan-
dard eight features. Parameter tuning is done with
Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003).
The tuning set for MERT is the NIST MT06 data
set, which includes 1664 sentences. We evaluate the
result with MT02 (878 sentences), MT03 (919 sen-

amples) divided by (#all examples). The macro-F is an
average of the accuracies of the two classes.
The basic source word features described in Sec-
tion 2 are referred to as Src, and the target word
features as Tgt. The feature set that Zens and Ney
(2006) used in their MT experiments is Src+Tgt. In
addition to that, we also experimented with source
word features Src2 which are similar to Src, but take
a window of 3 around j? instead of j. In Table 3
we can see that adding the Src2 features increased
the total number of features by almost 50%, but also
improved the performance. The PATH features add
fewer total number of features than the lexical fea-
tures, but still provide a 10% error reduction and
1.63 on the macro-F1 on the dev set. We use the best
feature sets from the feature engineering in Table 3
and test it on the test set. We get 94.28% accuracy
and 87.17 macro-F1. The overall improvement of
accuracy over the baseline is 8.19 absolute points.
4.3 MT Experiments
In the MT setting, we use the log probability from
the phrase orientation classifier as an extra feature.
The weight of this discriminative reordering feature
is also tuned by MERT, along with other Moses
features. In order to understand how much the
PATH features add value to the MT experiments, we
trained two phrase orientation classifiers with differ-
ent features: one with the Src+Src2+Tgt feature set,
and the other one with Src+Src2+Tgt+PATH. The re-
sults are listed in Table 4. We compared to two
different baselines: one is Moses8Features which
has a distance-based reordering model, the other is
Baseline which also includes lexicalized reorder-
ing features. From the table we can see that using
the discriminative reordering model with PATH fea-
tures gives significant improvement over both base-

lines. If we use the discriminative reordering model
without PATH features and only with word features,
we still get improvement over the Moses8Features
baseline, but the MT performance is not signifi-
cantly different from Baseline which uses lexical-
ized reordering features. From Table 4 we see that
using the Src+Src2+Tgt+PATH features significantly
outperforms both baselines. Also, if we compare be-
tween Src+Src2+Tgt and Src+Src2+Tgt+PATH, the
differences are also statistically significant, which
shows the effectiveness of the path features.
4.4 Analysis: Highly-weighted Features in the
Phrase Orientation Model
There are a lot of features in the log-linear phrase
orientation model. We looked at some highly-
weighted PATH features to understand what kind
of grammatical constructions were informative for
phrase orientation. We found that many path fea-
tures corresponded to our intuitions. For example,
the feature PATH:prep-dobjR has a high weight for
being reversed. This feature informs the model that
in Chinese a PP usually appears before VP, but in
English they should be reversed. Other features
with high weights include features related to the
DE construction that is more likely to translate to
a relative clause, such as PATH:advmod-rcmod and
PATH:rcmod. They also indicate the phrases are
more likely to be chosen in reversed order. Another
frequent pattern that has not been emphasized in the
previous literature is PATH:det-nn, meaning that a
[DT NP1NP2] in Chinese is translated into English
as [NP2 DT NP1]. Examples with this feature are
in Figure 4. We can see that the important features
decided by the phrase orientation model are also im-
portant from a linguistic perspective.
5 Conclusion
We introduced a set of Chinese typed dependencies
that gives information about grammatical relations
between words, and which may be useful in other
NLP applications as well as MT. We used the typed
dependencies to build path features and used them to
improve a phrase orientation classifier. The path fea-
tures gave a 10% error reduction on the accuracy of
the classifier and 1.63 points on the macro-F1 score.
We applied the log probability as an additional fea-
ture in a phrase-based MT system, which improved
the BLEU score of the three test sets significantly
(0.59 on MT02, 1.00 on MT03 and 0.77 on MT05).
This shows that typed dependencies on the source
side are informative for the reordering component in
a phrase-based system. Whether typed dependen-
cies can lead to improvements in other syntax-based
MT systems remains a question for future research.
