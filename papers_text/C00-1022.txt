2 The Termino log ica l  Resources  
We use in this study a French/English bilingual 
terminology of the aeronautic domain. This 
hand-crafted atabase results tTrom a multi- 
disciplinary effort involving technical writers, 
translators, terminologists and engineers. In 
its current state, the database contains 12,267 
French/English term ctmt)les, structured in 70 
semantic ategories. As already ot)served in sev- 
eral terminological databases, multi-word terms 
cover the larger part; of the database (nearly 
80%). Tile described terms are mostly nouns 
but the database also contains about 200 verbs 
and verbal phrases. Table 1 gives some exam- 
pies of terms and a short description of the as- 
sociated categories. These linguistic resources 
are integrated in a computer-aided translation 
environment used by technical writers. 
Semantic ategories have originally been intro- 
duced in order to distinguish the various senses 
of polysemous terms. Each term couple is an- 
notated with one or more categories pecifying 
the contexts in which the translation is rec- 
ommended. An entry is associated to a ternr 
for each identified meaning. For example, the 
french term ddpasscmerd has at least two pos- 
sible meanings, corresponding to two different 
translations: ovc~iflow in the Data Processing 
category (DPR,) and out-o\[-./lushnc.ss in the Air- 
m'M't Structure category (STR). As shown in the 
examples of table 1, the assigmnent of seman- 
tic categories has been extended to monosemous 
terms. 
In our experiments of term categorization, only 
the fl:ench l;erms have 1)een used. 
3 Related  Work  
~brm Semantic Ca, teg'orizat, ion is on several as- 
pects similar to _Th(;sam'us l~2xtension (Uramoto, 
1996; Tokunaga et al, 1997). Our methods 
are ch)se to those used for positioning unknown 
words in thesauri. However, the two issues cm~ 
be ditlhrentiated with respect to the manit)u- 
lated data. A thesaurus is intended to cover 
a large set; of concet)tual domains while a ter- 
minological database is tbcused accurately on a 
specific topic and its related domains. For ex- 
ample, in (Tokunaga et al~ 1997), the thesaurus 
to be extended contains lnore than 500 cate- 
gories. This tends to make the t)roblem harder, 
lint, since many categories are strictly indepen- 
dent, it is easier to find distinctive tieatures be- 
tween categories. By contrast, our terminolog- 
ical database contains only 70 categories. But, 
in this restricted set, we find categories corre- 
sponding to close or even overlapping knowledge 
areas. It; is more difficult to ditt'erentiate hem.

only this method will l)e (les(:ribed in this 1)aper. 
We use as contextual cues the open-class words 
(nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) theft co- 
occur in the corpus with the technical terms. 
More precisely, the cues are open-class words 
surrounding the occllrr(;l ices of t;he term in some 
window of t)i'edetined size. Each new term to be 
(:ntegorizeA is rel)resented by the overall set of

Ec~ Nt ( Ci ) 
where Nt(C) is the occurrence number in 
training data of terms t)elonging to C. This 
probability accounts for the weight of cat- 
egory C in the corpus. 
4.2 Train ing and Test  
qJhe exogeneous classifier starts with the selec- 
tion of test documents in the cort)us. Technical 
terms found in these documents will form the 
test set. The remaining documents represent 
the training corl)us. %'aining and test stages 
are the following: 
? POS tagging.  The test and training cor- 
pora are tagged with MultAna, a tagger de- 
signed as an extension of the Multex mor- 
phological analyzer (Petitpierre and Rus- 
sell, 1995). Occurrences of the technical 
terms are identified during this stage and 
the terms to be categorized are those which 
are identified in the test corpus. 
? Ext ract ion  of  contextua l  cues.  For 
each term occurrence in training and test 
data, the contextual cues are collected. 
Only the lemmas of open-class words are 
used and cues may correspond to multi- 
word terms. Each test term is then repre- 
sented by the set of cues which have been 
collected in test data. 
'~Note that the categorization process could be simpli- 
fied by eliminating P(wi), since this quantity is constaifl; 
for all categories.

? F requency  ca lcu lat ion  and probabi l -  
ity est imat ion .  Training data are ex- 
plored to compute the frequencies (occur- 
rences and co-occurrences) of cues, terms 
and categories. As mentioned earlier (sec- 
tion 3), tile cue occun'ences which have 
been collected around the test terms are 
ignored during this step. Tile probabili- 
ties required for the categorization opera- 
tion are then computed. 
? Categor i za t ion  of  the  test  te rms.  The 
most probable categories are assigned to 
each test term (see section 4.1). Figure 1 
gives; some examples of exogencous catego- 
rization 3. 
5 Endogeneous Categorization 
Our approach to endogeneous categorization is
simpler. It is exclusively based oll a quantitative 
analysis of the lexical composition of technical 
terms. Henceforth, the open-class words used 
to compose technical terms will be called ter- 
minolwical components. The endogeneous ap- 
proach relies on a much more restricted source 
of data than the exogeneous approach, since the 
comI)one:nt set of a terminological database is 
quantitatively limited compared with the set of 
contextual cues extracted from corpora. Never- 
theless, we make the assumption that this quan- 
titative limitation is partly compensated by the 
aSome category labels are described in table 1.

Table 4: Results for the endogeneous apt)roach. 
Ten experiments have been run  fbr a total test 
set of 2320 terms, 
During the test phase, each test term is anno- 
tated with the most plausible categories accord- 
ing to its coxnl)onents. 
6 Exper iments  and  Eva luat ion  
To estimate the accuracy of the exogeueous 
method, we used a domain-specific orpus of 
541,964 words, coml)osed of documents I)ertain- 
tug to various textual genres (software st)ecifica- 
tions, maintenance procedures, manufacturing 
notices.. .) .  This corpus covered 63 of the 70 
categories. Each run starts with the selection 
e ta  document among the corpus documents. 
The known terms identified in this document 
are considered as test: terms. We used rela- 
tively wide contexts. The cues were extracted 
in a window of :t=20 words around the term. 
Each run involved more than 70,000 contexts 
of term occurrences. To experiment he endo- 
geneous apI)roach, test sets of col~xl)ound terms 
have l)een randomly extracted from the, terlni- 
nological database. 
We adopted an evaluation scheme similar to 
that detlned in (Tokunaga et al, 1997) for the- 
saux'us extension. The categorization is con- 
sidered successful if' the right categox'y appears 
among the t~: first categories assigned by the 
classifier. Within a semi-automatic acquisition 
framework, this evaluation scheme is more suit- 
able than strict evaluation where only the first 
category assigned by the classifier is consid- 
ered as relevant (evaluation restricted to h=l.) 'l. 
Frolu oux' application 1)erspective, it is useful to 
provide to the terminologist a restricted set of 
less than 5 t)lausible categories instead of the 
complete set of 70 categories without prior fil- 
tering. 
In the experiments des(:ribed in (Tokunaga et 
al., 1997), k takes the values 5, 10, 20 and 30 
for average(t 1)ertbrmance ranging from 26.4:% 
to 55.9% (the choice is made among 544 cat- 
egories). Some of their precise experiments 
yielded an accm'acy greater than 80% fox' t~: 
= 30. In ore" experinmnts, we measured ac- 
curacy tbr h=l  to 5. Some results are given 
in tables 3 and 4. The scores are higher 
than those achieved in thesaurus extension, es- 
pecially with the exogeneous approach (fi'om 
52.75% to 97.61%). We should however keel) 
in mind that we deal with a diflbrent kind of 
data (see section 3). 
7 Conc lus ion  and  Fur ther  Work  
We have presented in this paper two al)proaches 
to term semantic ategorization that have been 
fully implemented and experimented on signifi- 
cant test sets. The results achieved in this work 
demonstrate that term categorization tasks 
could be integrated within a senti-automatic

out in (r/~esnik and Yarowski, 1999).
