Abstract
We present an approach to building a test
collection of research papers. The ap-
proach is based on the Cranfield 2 tests but
uses as its vehicle a current conference;
research questions and relevance judge-
ments of all cited papers are elicited from
conference authors. The resultant test col-
lection is different from TREC?s in that
it comprises scientific articles rather than
newspaper text and, thus, allows for IR
experiments that include citation informa-
tion. The test collection currently con-
sists of 170 queries with relevance judge-
ments; the document collection is the ACL
Anthology. We describe properties of
our queries and relevance judgements, and
demonstrate the use of the test collection
in an experimental setup. One potentially
problematic property of our collection is
that queries have a low number of relevant
documents; we discuss ways of alleviating
this.
1 Introduction
We present a methodology for creating a test collec-
tion of scientific papers that is based on the Cran-
field 2 methodology but uses a current conference as
the main vehicle for eliciting relevance judgements
from users, i.e., the authors.
Building a test collection is a long and expensive
process but was necessary as no ready-made test col-
lection existed on which the kinds of experiments
with citation information that we envisage could be
run. We aim to improve term-based IR on scien-
tific articles with citation information, by using in-
dex terms from the citing article to additionally de-
scribe the cited document. Exactly how to do this is
the research question that our test collection should
help to address.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 mo-
tivates our proposed experiments and, thereby, our
test collection. Section 3 discusses the how test col-
lections are built and, in particular, our own. Sec-
tion 4 briefly describes the practicalities of compil-
ing the document collection and the processing we
perform to prepare the documents for our experi-
ments. In Section 5, we show that our test collection
can be used with standard IR tools. Finally, Sec-
tion 6 discusses the problem of the low number of
relevant documents judged so far and two ways of
alleviating this problem.
2 Motivation
The idea of using terms external to a document,
coming from a ?citing? document, has been bor-
rowed from web-based IR. When one paper cites
another, a link is made between them and this link
structure is analogous to that of the web: ?hyper-
links ... provide semantic linkages between ob-
jects, much in the same manner that citations link
documents to other related documents? (Pitkow and
Pirolli, 1997). Link structure, particularly anchor
text, has been used to advantage in web-based IR.
While web pages are often poorly self-descriptive
(Brin and Page, 1998) anchor text is often a higher-
level description of the pointed-to page. (Davison,
391
2000) provides a good discussion of how well an-
chor text does this and provides experimental results
in support. Thus, beginning with (McBryan, 1994),
there is a trend of propagating anchor text along its
hyperlink to associate it with the linked page, as well
as the page in which it is found. Google, for ex-
ample, includes anchor text as index terms for the
linked page (Brin and Page, 1998). The TREC Web
tracks have also shown that using anchor text im-
proves retrieval effectiveness for some search tasks
(Hawking and Craswell, 2005).
This idea has already been applied to citations and
scientific articles (Bradshaw, 2003). In Bradshaw?s
experiment, scientific documents are indexed by the
text that refers to them in documents that cite them.
However, unlike in experiments with previous col-
lections, we need both the citing and the cited article
as full documents in our collection. The question of
how to identify citation ?anchor text? and its extent
is a matter for research; this requires the full text of
the citing article. Previous experiments and test col-
lections have had only limited access to the content
of the citing article: Bradshaw had access only to a
fixed window of text around the citation, as provided
by CiteSeer?s ?citation context?; in the GIRT collec-
tions (Kluck, 2003), a dozen or so content-bearing
information fields (e.g., title, abstract, methodologi-
cal descriptors) represent each document and the full
text is not available. Additionally, in Bradshaw?s ex-
periment, no access is given to the text of the cited
article itself so that the influence of a term-based IR
model cannot be studied and so that documents can
only be indexed if they have been cited at least once.
A test collection containing full text for many cit-
ing and cited documents, thus, has advantages from
a methodological point of view.
2.1 Choosing a Genre
When choosing a scientific field to study, we looked
for one that is practicable for us to compile the doc-
ument collection (freely available machine-readable
documents; as few as possible document styles),
while still ensuring good coverage of research top-
ics in an entire field. Had we chosen the medical
field or bioinformatics, the prolific number of jour-
nals would have been a problem for the practical
document preparation.
We also looked for a relatively self-contained
field. As we aim to propagate referential text to cited
papers as index terms, references from documents
in the collection to other documents within the col-
lection will be most useful. We call these internal
references. While it is impossible to find or create
a collection of documents with only internal refer-
ences, we aim for as high a proportion of internal
references as possible.
We chose the ACL (Association for Computa-
tional Linguistics) Anthology1 , a freely available
digital archive of computational linguistics research
papers. Computational linguistics is a small, ho-
mogenous research field and the Anthology contains
the most prominent publications since the beginning
of the field in 1960, consists of only 2 journals, 7
conferences and 5 less important publications, such
as discontinued conferences and a series of work-
shops, resulting in only 7000 papers2.
With the ACL Anthology, we expect a high pro-
portion of internal references within a relatively
compact document collection. We empirically mea-
sured the proportion of collection-internal refer-
ences. We found a proportion of internal refer-
ences to all references of 0.33 (the in-factor). We
wanted to compare this number to a situation in
another, larger field (genetics) but no straightfor-
ward comparison is possible, as there are very many
genetics journals and quality of journals probably
plays a larger role in a bigger field. We tried to
simulate a similar collection to the 9 main jour-
nals+conferences in the Anthology, by considering
10 journals in genetics with a range of impact fac-
tors3, resulting in an in-factor of 0.17 (dropping to
0.14 if only 5 journals are considered). Thus, our
hypothesis that the Anthology is reasonably self-
contained, at least in comparison with other possible
collections, was confirmed.
The choice of computational linguistics has the
added benefit that we are familiar with the domain;
we can interpret the subject matter better than we
would be able to in the medical domain. This should
be of use to us in our eventual experiments.

2This is our estimate, after substracting non-papers such as
letters to the editor, tables of contents etc. The Anthology is
growing by ?500 papers per year.
3Journal impact factor is a measure of the frequency with
which its average article is cited and is a measure of the relative
importance of journals within a field (Garfield, 1972).

3 Building Test Collections
To turn our document collection into a test col-
lection, a parallel set of search queries and rele-
vance judgements is needed. There are a number
of alternative methods for building a test collec-
tion. For TREC, humans devise queries specifically
for a given set of documents and make relevance
judgements on pooled retrieved documents from that
set (Harman, 2005). Theirs is an extremely labour-
intensive and expensive process and an unrealistic
option in the context of our project.
The Cranfield 2 tests (Cleverdon et al, 1966) in-
troduced an alternative method for creating a test
collection, specifically for scientific texts. The
method was subject to criticism and has not been
employed much since. Nevertheless, we believe this
method to be worth revisiting for our current situa-
tion. In this section, we describe in turn the Cran-
field 2 method and our adapted method. We discuss
some of the original criticisms and their bearing on
our own work, then describe our returns thus far.
3.1 The Cranfield 2 Test Collection
The Cranfield 2 tests (Cleverdon et al, 1966) were
a comparative evaluation of indexing language de-
vices. From a base collection of 182 (high speed
aerodynamics and aircraft structures) papers, the
Cranfield test collection was built by asking the au-
thors to formulate the research question(s) behind
their work and to judge how relevant each reference
in their paper was to each of their research questions,
on a 5-point scale. Referenced documents were ob-
tained and added to the base set. Authors were also
asked to list additional relevant papers not cited in
their paper. The collection was further expanded
in a second stage, using bibliographic coupling to
search for similar papers to the referenced ones and
employing humans to search the collection for other
relevant papers. The resultant collection comprised
1400 documents and 221 queries (Cleverdon, 1997).
The principles behind the Cranfield technique are:
? Queries: Each paper has an underlying research
question or questions; these constitute valid
search queries.
? Relevant documents: A paper?s reference list is
a good starting point for finding papers relevant
to its research questions.
? Judges: The paper author is the person best
qualified to judge relevance.
3.2 Our Anthology Test Collection
We altered the Cranfield design to fit to a fixed,
existing document collection. We designed our
methodology around an upcoming conference and
approached the paper authors at around the time of
the conference, to maximize their willingness to par-
ticipate and to minimise possible changes in their
perception of relevance since they wrote the paper.
Due to the relatively high in-factor of the collection,
we expected a significant proportion of the relevance
judgements gathered in this way to be about Anthol-
ogy documents and, thus, useful as evaluation data.
Hence, the authors of accepted papers for ACL-
2005 and HLT-EMNLP-2005 were asked, by email,
for their research questions and relevance judge-
ments for their references. We defined a 4-point
relevance scale, c.f. Table 1, since we felt that the
distinctions between the Cranfield grades were not
clear enough to warrant 5. Our guidelines also in-
cluded examples of referencing situations that might
fit each category. Personalized materials for partic-
ipation were sent, including a reproduction of their
paper?s reference list in their response form. This
meant that invitations could only be sent once the
paper had been made available online.
We further deviated from the Cranfield methodol-
ogy by deciding not to ask the authors to try to list
additional references that could have been included
in their reference list. An author?s willingness to
name such references will differ more from author
to author than their naming of original references, as
referencing is part of a standardized writing process.
By asking for this data, the consistency of the data
across papers will be degraded and the status of any
additional references will be unclear. Furthermore,
feedback from an informal pilot study conducted on
ten paper authors confirmed that some authors found
this task particularly difficult.
Each co-author of the papers was invited individu-
ally to participate, rather than inviting the first author
alone. This increased the number of invitations that
needed to be prepared and sent (by a factor of around
2.5) but also increased the likelihood of getting a re-
turn for a given paper. Furthermore, data from mul-
tiple co-authors of the same paper can be used to
393
Grade Description
4 The reference is crucially relevant to the problem. Knowledge of the contents of the referred work will be fun-
damental to the reader?s understanding of your paper. Often, such relevant references are afforded a substantial
amount of text in a paper e.g., a thorough summary.
3 The reference is relevant to the problem. It may be helpful for the reader to know the contents of the referred work,
but not crucial. The reference could not have been substituted or dropped without making significant additions to
the text. A few sentences may be associated with the reference.
2 The reference is somewhat (perhaps indirectly) relevant to the problem. Following up the reference probably would
not improve the reader?s understanding of your paper. Alternative references may have been equally appropriate
(e.g., the reference was chosen as a representative example from a number of similar references or included in a
list of similar references). Or the reference could have been dropped without damaging the informativeness of your
paper. Minimal text will be associated with the reference.

measure co-author agreement on the relevance task.
This is an interesting research question, as it is not
at all clear how much even close collaborators would
agree on relevance, but we do not address this here.
We plan to expand the collection in a second
stage, in line with the Cranfield 2 design. We will
reapproach contributing authors after obtaining re-
trieval results on our collection (e.g., with a stan-
dard IR engine) and ask them to make additional rel-
evance judgements on these papers.
3.3 Criticisms of Cranfield 2
Both Cranfield 1 (Cleverdon, 1960) and 2 were sub-
ject to various criticisms; (Spa?rck Jones, 1981) gives
an excellent account of the tests and their criticisms.
The majority were criticisms of the test collection
paradigm itself and are not pertinent here. How-
ever, the source-document principle (i.e., the use of
queries created from documents in the collection) at-
tracted particular criticisms. The fundamental con-
cern was that the way in which the queries were cre-
ated led to ?an unnaturally close relation? between
the terms in the queries and those used to index
the documents in the colection (Vickery, 1967); any
such relationship might have created a bias towards
a particular indexing language, distorting the com-
parisons that were the goal of the project.
In Cranfield 1, system success was measured
by retrieval of source documents alone, criticized
for being an over-simplification and a distortion of
?real-life? searching. The evaluation procedure was
changed for Cranfield 2 so that source documents
were excluded from searches and, instead, retrieval
of other relevant documents was used to measure
success. This removed the problem that, usually,
when a user searches, there is no source document
for their query. Despite this, Vickery notes that there
were ?still verbal links between sought document
and question? in the new method: each query author
was asked to judge the relevance of the source doc-
ument?s references and ?the questions ... were for-
mulated after the cited papers had been read and has
possibly influenced the wording of his question?.
While adapting the Cranfield 2 method to our
needs, we have tried to address some of the crit-
icisms, e.g., that authors? relevance judgements
change over time. Nevertheless, we still have
source-document queries and must consider the as-
sociated criticisms. Firstly, our test collection is
not intended for comparisons of indexing languages.
Rather, we aim to compare the effect of adding ex-
tra index terms to a base indexing of the documents.
The source documents will have no influence on
the base indexing of a document above that of the
other documents. The additional index terms, com-
ing from citations to that document, will generally
be ?chosen? by someone other than the query author,
with no knowledge of the query terms4. Also, our
documents will be indexed fully automatically, fur-
ther diminishing the scope of any subconscious hu-
man influence.
Thus, we believe that the suspect relationship be-
tween queries and indexing is negligible in the con-
4The exception to this is self-citation. This (very indirectly)
allows the query author to influence the indexing but it seems
highly improbable that an author would be thinking about their
query whilst citing a previous work.

text of our work, as opposed to the Cranfield tests,
and that the source-document principle is sound.
3.4 Returns and Analysis
Out of around 500 invitations sent to conference au-
thors, 85 resulted in research questions with rele-
vance judgements being returned; 235 queries in to-
tal. Example queries are:
? Do standard probabilistic parsing techniques,
developed for English, fare well for French and
does lexicalistion help improve parsing results?
? Analyze the lexical differences between genders
engaging in telephone conversations.
Of the 235 queries, 18 were from authors whose
co-authors had also returned data and were dis-
carded (for retrieval purposes); we treat co-author
data on the same paper as ?the same? and keep
only the first authors?. 47 queries had no relevant
Anthology-internal references and were discarded.
Another 15 had only relevant Anthology references
not yet included in the archive5; we keep these for
the time being. This leaves 170 unique queries with
at least 1 relevant Anthology reference and an aver-
age of 3.8 relevant Anthology references each. The
average in-factor across queries is 0.42 (similar to
our previously estimated Anthology in-factor)6 .
Our average number of judged relevant docu-
ments per query is lower than for Cranfield, which
had an average of 7.2 (Spa?rck Jones et al, 2000).
However, this is the final number for the Cran-
field collection, arrived at after the second stage
of relevance judging, which we have not yet car-
ried out. Nevertheless, we must anticipate a po-
tentially low number of relevant documents per
query, particularly in comparison to, e.g., the TREC
ad hoc track (Voorhees and Harman, 1999), with
86.8 judged relevant documents per query.
4 Document Collection and Processing
The Anthology documents are distributed in PDF, a
format designed to visually render printable docu-
ments, not to preserve editable text. So the PDF col-
lection must be converted into a fully textual format.
5HLT-NAACL-2004 papers, e.g., are listed as ?in process?.
6We cannot directly compare this to Cranfield?s in-factor as
we do not have access to the documents.

Figure 1: Document Processing Pipeline
A pipeline of processing stages has been developed
in the framework of a wider project, illustrated in
Figure 1.
Firstly, OmniPage Pro 147, a commercial PDF
processing software package, scans the PDFs and
produces an XML encoding of character-level page
layout information. AI algorithms for heuristically
extracting character information (similar to OCR)
are necessary since many of the PDFs were created
from scanned paper-copies and others do not contain
character information in an accessible format.
The OmniPage output describes a paper as text
blocks with typesetting information such as font and
positional information. A pre-processor (Lewin et
al., 2005) filters and summarizes the OmniPage out-
put into Intermediate XML (IXML), as well as cor-
recting certain characteristic errors from that stage.
A journal-specific template converts the IXML to a
logical XML-based document structure (Teufel and
Elhadad, 2002), by exploiting low-level, presenta-
tional, journal-specific information such as font size
and positioning of text blocks.
Subsequent stages incrementally add more de-
tailed information to the logical representation. The
paper?s reference list is annotated in more detail,
marking up individual references, author names, ti-
tles and years of publication. Finally, a citation pro-
cessor identifies and marks up citations in the doc-
ument body and their constituent parts, e.g., author
names and years.
5 Preliminary Experimentation
We expect that our test collection, built for our cita-
tion experiments, will be of wider value and we in-
tend to make it publicly available. As a sanity check
on our data so far, we carried out some preliminary
experimentation, using standard IR tools: the Lemur
Toolkit8, specifically Indri (Strohman et al, 2005),
7http://www.scansoft.com/omnipage/

395
its integrated language-model based search engine,
and the TREC evaluation software, trec eval9.
5.1 Experimental Set-up
We indexed around 4200 Anthology documents.
This is the total number of documents that have, at
the time of writing, been processed by our pipeline
(24 years of CL journal, 25 years of ACL proceed-
ings, 14 years of assorted workshops), plus another
?90 documents for which we have relevance judge-
ments that are not currently available through the
Anthology website but should be incorporated into
the archive in the future. The indexed documents do
not yet contain annotation of the reference list or ci-
tations in text. 19 of our 170 queries have no relevant
references in the indexed documents and were not
included in these experiments. Thus, Figure 2 shows
the distribution of queries over number of relevant
Anthology references, for a total of 151 queries.
Our Indri index was built using default parameters
with no optional processing, e.g., stopping or stem-
ming, resulting in a total of 20117410 terms, 218977
unique terms and 2263 ?frequent?10 terms.
We then prepared an Indri-style query file from
the conference research questions. The Indri query
language is designed to handle highly complex
queries but, for our very basic purposes, we created
simple bag-of-words queries by stripping all punctu-
ation from the natural language questions and using
Indri?s #combine operator over all the terms. This
means Indri ranks documents in accordance with
query likelihood. Again, no stopping or stemming
was applied.
Next, the query file was run against the Anthology
index using IndriRunQuery with default parameters
and, thus, retrieving 1000 documents for each query.
Finally, for evaluation, we converted the Indri?s
ranked document lists to TREC-style top results file
and the conference relevance judgements compiled
into a TREC-style qrels file, including only judge-
ments corresponding to references within the in-
dexed documents. These files were then input to
trec eval, to calculate precision and recall metrics.

Figure 3: Effect of Thresholding on P at 5 Docs
5.2 Results and Discussion
Out of 489 relevant documents, 329 were retrieved
within 1000 (per query) documents. The mean av-
erage precision (MAP) was 0.1014 over the 151
queries. This is the precision calculated at each rele-
vant document retrieved (0.0, if that document is not
retrieved), averaged over all relevant documents for
all queries, i.e., non-interpolated. R-precision, the
precision after R (the number of relevant documents
for a query) documents are returned, was 0.0965.
The average precision at 5 documents was 0.0728.
We investigated the effect of excluding queries
with lower than a threshold number of judged rel-
evant documents. Figure 3 shows that precision at
5 documents increases as greater threshold values
are applied. Similar trends were observed with other
evaluation measures, e.g., MAP and R-precision in-
creased to 0.2018 and 0.1528, respectively, when
only queries with 13 or more relevant documents
were run, though such stringent thresholding does
result in very few queries. Nevertheless, these trends
do suggest that the present low number of relevant
documents has an adverse effect on retrieval results
and is a potential problem for our test collection.
We also investigated the effect of including only
authors? main queries, as another potential way of
objectively constructing a ?higher quality? query set.
Although, this decreased the average in-factor of rel-
evant references, it did, in fact, increase the average
absolute number of relevant references in the index.
Thus, MAP increased to 0.1165, precision at 5 doc-
uments to 0.1016 and R-precision to 0.1201.
These numbers look poor in comparison to the
performance of IR systems at TREC but, impor-
tantly, they are not intended as performance results.
Their purpose is to demonstrate that such numbers
can be produced using the data we have collected,

rather than to evaluate the performance of some new
retrieval system or strategy.
A second point for consideration follows directly
from the first: our experiments were carried out
on a new test collection and ?different test collec-
tions have different intrinsic difficulty? (Buckley
and Voorhees, 2004). Thus, it is meaningless to
compare statistics from this data (from a different
domain) to those from the TREC collections, where
queries and relevance judgements were collected in
a different way, and where there are very many rele-
vant documents.
Thirdly, our experiments used only the most basic
techniques and the results could undoubtedly be im-
proved by, e.g., applying a simple stop-list. Never-
theless, this notion of intrinsic difficulty means that
it may be the case that evaluations carried out on this
collection will produce characteristically low preci-
sion values.
Low numbers do not necessarily preclude our
data?s usefulness as a test collection, whose purpose
is to facilitate comparative evaluations. (Voorhees,
1998) states that ?To be viable as a laboratory tool,
a [test] collection must reliably rank different re-
trieval variants according to their true effectiveness?
and defends the Cranfield paradigm (from criticisms
based on relevance subjectivity) by demonstrating
that the relative performance of retrieval runs is sta-
ble despite differences in relevance judgements. The
underlying principle is that it is not the absolute pre-
cision values that matter but the ability to compare
these values for different retrieval techniques or sys-
tems, to investigate their relative benefits. A test col-
lection with low precision values will still allow this.
It is known that all evaluation measures are un-
stable for very small numbers of relevant documents
(Buckley and Voorhees, 2000) and there are issues
arising from incomplete relevance information in a
test collection (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004). This
makes the second stage of our test collection com-
pilation even more indispensable (asking subjects to
judge retrieved documents), as this will increase the
number of judged relevant documents, as well as
bridging the completeness gap.
There are further possibilities of how the prob-
lem could be countered. We could exclude queries
with lower than a threshold number of relevant docu-
ments (after the second stage). Given the respectable
number of queries we have, we might be able to af-
ford this luxury. We could add relevant documents
from outside the Anthology to our collection. This
is least preferable methodologically: using the An-
thology has the advantage that it has a real identity
and was created for real reasons outside our experi-
ments. Furthermore, the collection ?covers a field?,
i.e., it includes all important publications and only
those. By adding external documents to the collec-
tion, it would lose both these properties.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We have presented an approach to building a test
collection from an existing collection of research pa-
pers and described the application of our method
to the ACL Anthology. We have collected 170
queries with relevance data, centered around the
ACL-2005 and HLT-EMNLP-2005 conferences. We
397
have sanity-checked the usability of our data by
running the queries through a retrieval system and
evaluating the results using standard software. The
collection currently has a low number of judged
relevant documents and further experimentation is
needed to determine if this poses a real problem.
We plan a second stage of collecting relevance
judgements, in line with the original Cranfield de-
sign, whereby authors who have contributed queries
will be asked to judge the relevance of documents in
retrieval rankings from standard IR models and, ide-
ally, from our eventual citation-based experiments.
Nevertheless, our test collection is likely to suffer
from incomplete relevance information. The bpref
measure (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004) gauges re-
trieval effectiveness solely on the basis of judged
documents and is more stable to differing levels
of completeness than measures such as MAP, R-
precision or precision at fixed document cutoffs.
Thus, bpref may offer a solution to the incomplete-
ness problem and we intend to investigate its poten-
tial use in our future evaluations.
When finished, we hope our test collection will
be a generally useful IR resource. In particular, we
expect the collection to be useful for experimenta-
tion with citation information, for which there is cur-
rently no existing test collection with the properties
that ours offers.
