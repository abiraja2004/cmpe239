Abstract
We present an extension of phrase-based
statistical machine translation models that
enables the straight-forward integration of
additional annotation at the word-level ?
may it be linguistic markup or automati-
cally generated word classes. In a num-
ber of experiments we show that factored
translation models lead to better transla-
tion performance, both in terms of auto-
matic scores, as well as more grammatical
coherence.
1 Introduction
The current state-of-the-art approach to statistical
machine translation, so-called phrase-based models,
is limited to the mapping of small text chunks with-
out any explicit use of linguistic information, may
it be morphological, syntactic, or semantic. Such
additional information has been demonstrated to be
valuable by integrating it in pre-processing or post-
processing steps.
However, a tighter integration of linguistic infor-
mation into the translation model is desirable for two
reasons:
? Translation models that operate on more gen-
eral representations, such as lemmas instead
of surface forms of words, can draw on richer
statistics and overcome the data sparseness
problems caused by limited training data.
? Many aspects of translation can be best ex-
plained on a morphological, syntactic, or se-
mantic level. Having such information avail-
able to the translation model allows the direct
modeling of these aspects. For instance: re-
ordering at the sentence level is mostly driven

by general syntactic principles, local agreement
constraints show up in morphology, etc.
Therefore, we extended the phrase-based ap-
proach to statistical translation to tightly integrate
additional information. The new approach allows
additional annotation at the word level. A word in
our framework is not only a token, but a vector of
factors that represent different levels of annotation
(see Figure 1).
We report on experiments with factors such as
surface form, lemma, part-of-speech, morphologi-
cal features such as gender, count and case, auto-
matic word classes, true case forms of words, shal-
low syntactic tags, as well as dedicated factors to en-
sure agreement between syntactically related items.
This paper describes the motivation, the modeling
aspects and the computationally efficient decoding
methods of factored translation models. We present
briefly results for a number of language pairs. How-
ever, the focus of this paper is the description of the
approach. Detailed experimental results will be de-
scribed in forthcoming papers.

2 Related Work
Many attempts have been made to add richer in-
formation to statistical machine translation models.
Most of these focus on the pre-processing of the in-
put to the statistical system, or the post-processing
of its output. Our framework is more general and
goes beyond recent work on models that back off
to representations with richer statistics (Nie?en and
Ney, 2001; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Talbot and
Osborne, 2006) by keeping a more complex repre-
sentation throughout the translation process.
Rich morphology often poses a challenge to sta-
tistical machine translation, since a multitude of
word forms derived from the same lemma fragment
the data and lead to sparse data problems. If the in-
put language is morphologically richer than the out-
put language, it helps to stem or segment the input
in a pre-processing step, before passing it on to the
translation system (Lee, 2004; Sadat and Habash,
2006).
Structural problems have also been addressed by
pre-processing: Collins et al (2005) reorder the in-
put to a statistical system to closer match the word
order of the output language.
On the other end of the translation pipeline, addi-
tional information has been used in post-processing.
Och et al (2004) report minor improvements with
linguistic features on a Chinese-English task, Koehn
and Knight (2003) show some success in re-ranking
noun phrases for German-English. In their ap-
proaches, first, an n-best list with the best transla-
tions is generated for each input sentence. Then,
the n-best list is enriched with additional features,
for instance by syntactically parsing each candidate
translation and adding a parse score. The additional
features are used to rescore the n-best list, resulting
possibly in a better best translation for the sentence.
The goal of integrating syntactic information
into the translation model has prompted many re-
searchers to pursue tree-based transfer models (Wu,
1997; Alshawi et al, 1998; Yamada and Knight,
2001; Melamed, 2004; Menezes and Quirk, 2005;
Galley et al, 2006), with increasingly encouraging
results. Our goal is complementary to these efforts:
we are less interested in recursive syntactic struc-
ture, but in richer annotation at the word level. In
future work, these approaches may be combined.

3 Motivating Example: Morphology
One example to illustrate the short-comings of the
traditional surface word approach in statistical ma-
chine translation is the poor handling of morphol-
ogy. Each word form is treated as a token in it-
self. This means that the translation model treats,
say, the word house completely independent of the
word houses. Any instance of house in the training
data does not add any knowledge to the translation
of houses.
In the extreme case, while the translation of house
may be known to the model, the word housesmay be
unknown and the system will not be able to translate
it. While this problem does not show up as strongly
in English ? due to the very limited morphologi-
cal inflection in English ? it does constitute a sig-
nificant problem for morphologically rich languages
such as Arabic, German, Czech, etc.
Thus, it may be preferably to model translation
between morphologically rich languages on the level
of lemmas, and thus pooling the evidence for differ-
ent word forms that derive from a common lemma.
In such a model, we would want to translate lemma
and morphological information separately, and com-
bine this information on the output side to ultimately
generate the output surface words.
Such a model can be defined straight-forward as
a factored translation model. See Figure 2 for an
illustration of this model in our framework.
Note that while we illustrate the use of factored
translation models on such a linguistically motivated
869
example, our framework also applies to models that
incorporate statistically defined word classes, or any
other annotation.
4 Decomposition of Factored Translation
The translation of factored representations of in-
put words into the factored representations of out-
put words is broken up into a sequence of mapping
steps that either translate input factors into output
factors, or generate additional output factors from
existing output factors.
Recall the example of a factored model motivated
by morphological analysis and generation. In this
model the translation process is broken up into the
following three mapping steps:
1. Translate input lemmas into output lemmas
2. Translate morphological and POS factors
3. Generate surface forms given the lemma and
linguistic factors
Factored translation models build on the phrase-
based approach (Koehn et al, 2003) that breaks up
the translation of a sentence into the translation of
small text chunks (so-called phrases). This approach
implicitly defines a segmentation of the input and
output sentences into phrases. See an example in
Figure 3.
Our current implementation of factored transla-
tion models follows strictly the phrase-based ap-
proach, with the additional decomposition of phrase
translation into a sequence of mapping steps. Trans-
lation steps map factors in input phrases to factors
in output phrases. Generation steps map output
factors within individual output words. To reiter-
ate: all translation steps operate on the phrase level,
while all generation steps operate on the word level.
Since all mapping steps operate on the same phrase
segmentation of the input and output sentence into
phrase pairs, we call these synchronous factored
models.
Let us now take a closer look at one example, the
translation of the one-word phrase ha?user into En-
glish. The representation of ha?user in German is:
surface-form ha?user | lemma haus | part-of-speech
NN | count plural | case nominative | gender neutral.
neue h?user werden gebaut
new houses are built
Figure 3: Example sentence translation by a stan-
dard phrase model. Factored models extend this ap-
proach.
The three mapping steps in our morphological
analysis and generation model may provide the fol-
lowing applicable mappings:
1. Translation: Mapping lemmas
? haus ? house, home, building, shell
2. Translation: Mapping morphology
? NN|plural-nominative-neutral ?
NN|plural, NN|singular
3. Generation: Generating surface forms
? house|NN|plural ? houses
? house|NN|singular ? house
? home|NN|plural ? homes
? ...
We call the application of these mapping steps
to an input phrase expansion. Given the multi-
ple choices for each step (reflecting the ambigu-
ity in translation), each input phrase may be ex-
panded into a list of translation options. The German
ha?user|haus|NN|plural-nominative-neutral may be
expanded as follows:
1. Translation: Mapping lemmas
{ ?|house|?|?, ?|home|?|?, ?|building|?|?,
?|shell|?|? }
2. Translation: Mapping morphology
{ ?|house|NN|plural, ?|home|NN|plural,
?|building|NN|plural, ?|shell|NN|plural,
?|house|NN|singular, ... }
3. Generation: Generating surface forms
{ houses|house|NN|plural,
homes|home|NN|plural,
buildings|building|NN|plural,
shells|shell|NN|plural,
house|house|NN|singular, ... }

5 Statistical Model
Factored translation models follow closely the sta-
tistical modeling approach of phrase-based models
(in fact, phrase-based models are a special case of
factored models). The main difference lies in the
preparation of the training data and the type of mod-
els learned from the data.
5.1 Training
The training data (a parallel corpus) has to be anno-
tated with the additional factors. For instance, if we
want to add part-of-speech information on the input
and output side, we need to obtain part-of-speech
tagged training data. Typically this involves running
automatic tools on the corpus, since manually anno-
tated corpora are rare and expensive to produce.
Next, we need to establish a word-alignment
for all the sentences in the parallel training cor-
pus. Here, we use the same methodology as
in phrase-based models (typically symmetrized
GIZA++ alignments). The word alignment methods
may operate on the surface forms of words, or on any
of the other factors. In fact, some preliminary ex-
periments have shown that word alignment based on
lemmas or stems yields improved alignment quality.
Each mapping step forms a component of the
overall model. From a training point of view this
means that we need to learn translation and gener-
ation tables from the word-aligned parallel corpus
and define scoring methods that help us to choose
between ambiguous mappings.
Phrase-based translation models are acquired
from a word-aligned parallel corpus by extracting all
phrase-pairs that are consistent with the word align-
ment. Given the set of extracted phrase pairs with
counts, various scoring functions are estimated,
such as conditional phrase translation probabilities
based on relative frequency estimation or lexical
translation probabilities based on the words in the
phrases.
In our approach, the models for the translation
steps are acquired in the same manner from a word-
aligned parallel corpus. For the specified factors in
the input and output, phrase mappings are extracted.
The set of phrase mappings (now over factored rep-
resentations) is scored based on relative counts and
word-based translation probabilities.
The generation distributions are estimated on the
output side only. The word alignment plays no
role here. In fact, additional monolingual data may
be used. The generation model is learned on a
word-for-word basis. For instance, for a genera-
tion step that maps surface forms to part-of-speech,
a table with entries such as (fish,NN) is constructed.
One or more scoring functions may be defined over
this table, in our experiments we used both condi-
tional probability distributions, e.g., p(fish|NN) and
p(NN|fish), obtained by maximum likelihood esti-
mation.
An important component of statistical machine
translation is the language model, typically an n-
gram model over surface forms of words. In the
framework of factored translation models, such se-
quence models may be defined over any factor, or
any set of factors. For factors such as part-of-speech
tags, building and using higher order n-gram models
(7-gram, 9-gram) is straight-forward.
5.2 Combination of Components
As in phrase-based models, factored translation
models can be seen as the combination of several
components (language model, reordering model,
translation steps, generation steps). These compo-
nents define one or more feature functions that are
combined in a log-linear model:
p(e|f) =
1
Z
exp
n?
i=1
?ihi(e, f) (1)
Z is a normalization constant that is ignored in
practice. To compute the probability of a translation
e given an input sentence f, we have to evaluate each
feature function hi. For instance, the feature func-
tion for a bigram language model component is (m
is the number of words ei in the sentence e):
hLM(e, f) = pLM(e)
= p(e1) p(e2|e1)..p(em|em?1)
(2)
Let us now consider the feature functions intro-
duced by the translation and generation steps of fac-
tored translation models. The translation of the input
sentence f into the output sentence e breaks down to
a set of phrase translations {(f?j , e?j)}.
For a translation step component, each feature
function hT is defined over the phrase pairs (f?j , e?j)
871
given a scoring function ? :
hT(e, f) =
?
j
?(f?j , e?j) (3)
For a generation step component, each feature
function hG given a scoring function ? is defined
over the output words ek only:
hG(e, f) =
?
k
?(ek) (4)
The feature functions follow from the scoring
functions (? , ?) acquired during the training of
translation and generation tables. For instance, re-
call our earlier example: a scoring function for a
generation model component that is a conditional
probability distribution between input and output
factors, e.g., ?(fish,NN,singular) = p(NN|fish).
The feature weights ?i in the log-linear model
are determined using a minimum error rate training
method, typically Powell?s method (Och, 2003).
5.3 Efficient Decoding
Compared to phrase-based models, the decomposi-
tion of phrase translation into several mapping steps
creates additional computational complexity. In-
stead of a simple table look-up to obtain the possible
translations for an input phrase, now multiple tables
have to be consulted and their content combined.
In phrase-based models it is easy to identify the
entries in the phrase table that may be used for a
specific input sentence. These are called translation
options. We usually limit ourselves to the top 20
translation options for each input phrase.
The beam search decoding algorithm starts with
an empty hypothesis. Then new hypotheses are gen-
erated by using all applicable translation options.
These hypotheses are used to generate further hy-
potheses in the same manner, and so on, until hy-
potheses are created that cover the full input sen-
tence. The highest scoring complete hypothesis in-
dicates the best translation according to the model.
How do we adapt this algorithm for factored
translation models? Since all mapping steps operate
on the same phrase segmentation, the expansions of
these mapping steps can be efficiently pre-computed
prior to the heuristic beam search, and stored as
translation options. For a given input phrase, all pos-
sible translation options are thus computed before

decoding (recall the example in Section 4, where we
carried out the expansion for one input phrase). This
means that the fundamental search algorithm does
not change.
However, we need to be careful about combina-
torial explosion of the number of translation options
given a sequence of mapping steps. In other words,
the expansion may create too many translation op-
tions to handle. If one or many mapping steps result
in a vast increase of (intermediate) expansions, this
may be become unmanageable. We currently ad-
dress this problem by early pruning of expansions,
and limiting the number of translation options per
input phrase to a maximum number, by default 50.
This is, however, not a perfect solution. We are cur-
rently working on a more efficient search for the top
50 translation options to replace the current brute-
force approach.
6 Experiments
We carried out a number of experiments using the
factored translation model framework, incorporating
both linguistic information and automatically gener-
ated word classes.
This work is implemented as part of the open
source Moses1 system (Koehn et al, 2007). We used
the default settings for this system.
6.1 Syntactically Enriched Output
In the first set of experiments, we translate surface
forms of words and generate additional output fac-
tors from them (see Figure 4 for an illustration). By
adding morphological and shallow syntactic infor-

els (just like n-gram language models over words) in
order to support syntactic coherence of the output.
Table 1 summarizes the experimental results.
The English?German systems were trained on the
full 751,088 sentence Europarl corpus and evaluated
on the WMT 2006 test set (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
Adding part-of-speech and morphological factors on
the output side and exploiting them with 7-gram
sequence models results in minor improvements in
BLEU. The model that incorporates both POS and
morphology (18.22% BLEU vs. baseline 18.04%
BLEU) ensures better local grammatical coherence.
The baseline system produces often phrases such
as zur(to) zwischenstaatlichen(inter-governmental)
methoden(methods), with a mismatch between the
determiner (singular) and the noun (plural), while
the adjective is ambiguous. In a manual evaluation
of intra-NP agreement we found that the factored
model reduced the disagreement error within noun
phrases of length ? 3 from 15% to 4%.
English?Spanish systems were trained on a
40,000 sentence subset of the Europarl corpus. Here,
we also used morphological and part-of-speech fac-
tors on the output side with an 7-gram sequence
model, resulting in absolute improvements of 1.25%
(only morph) and 0.84% (morph+POS). Improve-
ments on the full Europarl corpus are smaller.
English-Czech systems were trained on a 20,000
sentence Wall Street Journal corpus. Morphologi-
cal features were exploited with a 7-gram language
model. Experimentation suggests that it is benefi-
cial to carefully consider which morphological fea-
tures to be used. Adding all features results in
lower performance (27.04% BLEU), than consider-
ing only case, number and gender (27.45% BLEU)
or additionally verbial (person, tense, and aspect)
and prepositional (lemma and case) morphology
(27.62% BLEU). All these models score well above
the baseline of 25.82% BLEU.
An extended description of these experiments is
in the JHU workshop report (Koehn et al, 2006).
6.2 Morphological Analysis and Generation
The next model is the one described in our motivat-
ing example in Section 4 (see also Figure 2). Instead
of translating surface forms of words, we translate
word lemma and morphology separately, and gener-
ate the surface form of the word on the output side.
We carried out experiments for the language pair
German?English, using the 52,185 sentence News
Commentary corpus2. We report results on the de-
velopment test set, which is also the out-of-domain
test set of the WMT06 workshop shared task (Koehn
and Monz, 2006). German morphological analysis
and POS tagging was done using LoPar Schmidt and
Schulte im Walde (2000), English POS tagging was
done with Brill?s tagger (Brill, 1995), followed by a
simple lemmatizer based on tagging results.
Experimental results are summarized in Table 2.
For this data set, we also see an improvement when
using a part-of-speech language model ? the BLEU
score increases from 18.19% to 19.05% ? consis-
tent with the results reported in the previous section.
However, moving from a surface word translation
mapping to a lemma/morphology mapping leads to
a deterioration of performance to a BLEU score of
14.46%.
Note that this model completely ignores the sur-
face forms of input words and only relies on the

more general lemma and morphology information.
While this allows the translation of word forms with
known lemma and unknown surface form, on bal-
ance it seems to be disadvantage to throw away sur-
face form information.
To overcome this problem, we introduce an al-
ternative path model: Translation options in this
model may come either from the surface form model
or from the lemma/morphology model we just de-
scribed. For surface forms with rich evidence in
the training data, we prefer surface form mappings,
and for surface forms with poor or no evidence in
the training data we decompose surface forms into
lemma and morphology information and map these
separately. The different translation tables form dif-
ferent components in the log-linear model, whose
weights are set using standard minimum error rate
training methods.
The alternative path model outperforms the sur-
face form model with POS LM, with an BLEU score
of 19.47% vs. 19.05%. The test set has 3276 un-
known word forms vs 2589 unknown lemmas (out
of 26,898 words). Hence, the lemma/morph model
is able to translate 687 additional words.
6.3 Use of Automatic Word Classes
Finally, we went beyond linguistically motivated
factors and carried out experiments with automati-
cally trained word classes. By clustering words to-
gether by their contextual similarity, we are able to
find statistically similarities that may lead to more
generalized and robust models.
We trained models on the IWSLT 2006 task
(39,953 sentences). Compared to a baseline
English?Chinese system, adding word classes on the
output side as additional factors (in a model as pre-

6.4 Integrated Recasing
To demonstrate the versatility of the factored trans-
lation model approach, consider the task of recas-
ing (Lita et al, 2003; Wang et al, 2006). Typically
in statistical machine translation, the training data is
lowercased to generalize over differently cased sur-
face forms ? say, the, The, THE ? which neces-
sitates a post-processing step to restore case in the
output.
With factored translation models, it is possible
to integrate this step into the model, by adding a
generation step. See Table 4 for an illustration of
this model and experimental results on the IWSLT
2006 task (Chinese-English). The integrated recas-
ing model outperform the standard approach with an
BLEU score of 21.08% to 20.65%. For more on this
experiment, see (Shen et al, 2006).

6.5 Additional Experiments
Factored translation models have also been used
for the integration of CCG supertags (Birch et al,
2007), domain adaptation (Koehn and Schroeder,
2007) and for the improvement of English-Czech
translation (Bojar, 2007).
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented an extension of the state-of-the-art
phrase-based approach to statistical machine trans-
lation that allows the straight-forward integration of
additional information, may it come from linguistic
tools or automatically acquired word classes.
We reported on experiments that showed gains
over standard phrase-based models, both in terms
of automatic scores (gains of up to 2% BLEU), as
well as a measure of grammatical coherence. These
experiments demonstrate that within the framework
of factored translation models additional informa-
tion can be successfully exploited to overcome some
short-comings of the currently dominant phrase-
based statistical approach.
The framework of factored translation models is
very general. Many more models that incorporate
different factors can be quickly built using the ex-
isting implementation. We are currently exploring
these possibilities, for instance use of syntactic in-
formation in reordering and models with augmented
input information.
We have not addressed all computational prob-
lems of factored translation models. In fact, compu-
tational problems hold back experiments with more
complex factored models that are theoretically pos-
sible but too computationally expensive to carry out.
Our current focus is to develop a more efficient im-
plementation that will enable these experiments.
Moreover, we expect to overcome the constraints
of the currently implemented synchronous factored
models by developing a more general asynchronous
framework, where multiple translation steps may
operate on different phrase segmentations (for in-
stance a part-of-speech model for large scale re-
ordering).
