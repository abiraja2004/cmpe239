Robust Speech Recognition Technology 
Program Summary 1 
Principal Investigators: Clifford J. Weinstein and Douglas B. Paul 
MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high-performance continu- 
ous speech recognizer (CSR) techniques and systems focussed on application in spoken language sys- 
tems (SLS). The techniques are based on a continuous-observation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
approach, which has previously demonstrated high performance for normal speech and robustness 
for stressed speech. The motivation is that current state-of-the-art CSR systems must be improved 
in performance and robustness for advanced SLS environments, with variabilities including those 
due to spontaneous speech, noise, and task-induced stress. The focus of the robust CSR techniques 
on SLS applications is being facilitated by development and implementation of a well-structured 
interface between a CSR and a natural language processor (NLP), allowing collaboration with other 
groups developing NLPs for SLS applications. 
The Lincoln program began with a focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighter 
aircraft environment. A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with 
99% accuracy under stress conditions, representing more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in 
error rate relative to a baseline HMM system. 
The robustness techniques were then adapted to large vocabulary CSR with high performance 
for both speaker-dependent a d speaker-independent tasks on the DARPA Resource Management 
database. 
Recent accomplishments include: (1) development and integration into HMM CSR system 
of tied-mixture and word-context-dependent phone-modelling techniques; (2) development and 
demonstration of a voice-controlled flight simulator system - -  a simple, but complete SLS which 
integrates the robust CSt~ into a stressing, real-time task; and (3) development of a proposed 
specification for a structured interface between CSR and NLP, based on a stack decoder control 
structure. 
Plans for the current program include: (1) continue to improve HMM CSi~ performance and ro- 
bustness using tied-mixture techniques and techniques to match the model complexity to amount of 
training data; (2) develop new acoustic-phonetic modelling and recognition techniques; (3) complete 
the CSR/NLP interface design, incorporating inputs from other groups, and develop a prototype 
interface implementation; (4) convert HMM CSR to use a stack decoder control structure, to match 
the CSR-NLP interface and to allow integration of the Lincoln CSR with an NLP developed at 
another site.
