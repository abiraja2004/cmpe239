1. iNTRODUCTION 
A newspaper story about terrorism, war, politics or 
football is not likely to be read in the same way as a 
gothic novel, college catalog or physics textbook. 
Similarly, tne process used to understand a casual 
conversation is unlikely to be the same as the process 
of understanding a biology lecture or TV situation 
comedy. One of the primary differences amongst these 
various types of comprehension is that the reader or 
listener will nave different goals in each case. The 
reasons a person nan for reading, or the goals he has 
when engaging in conversation wlll nave a strong affect 
on what he pays attention to, how deeply the input is 
processed, and what information is incorporated into 
memory. The computer model of understanding described 
nere addresses the problem of using a reader's purpose 
to assist in natural language understanding. This 
program, the Integrated Partial Parser (IPP) ~s designed 
to model the way people read newspaper stories in a 
robust, comprehensive, manner. IPP nan a set of 
interests, much as a human reader does. At the moment 
it concentrates on stories about International violence 
and terrorism. 
IPP contrasts sharply wlth many other tecnniques which 
have been used in parslng. Most models of language 
processing have had no purpose in reading. They pursue 
all inputs with the same dillgence and create the same 
type of representation for all stories. The key 
difference in IPP is that it maps lexlcal input into as 
high a level representation as possible, thereby 
performing the complete understanding process. Other 
approaches have invariably first tried to create a 
preliminary representation, often a strictly syntactic 
parse tree, in preparation for real understandlng. 
~ince high-level, semantic representations are 
ultimately necessary for understanding,  there is no 
obvious need for creating a preliminary syntactic 
representation, which can be a very difficult task. The 
isolation of the lexlcal level processing from more 
complete understanding processes makes it very difficult 
for hlgn l eve l  predictions to influence l ow- leve l  
processing, which is crucial in IPP. 
One very popular  technique fo r  c reat ing  a low- leve l  
representation of sentences has been the Augmented 
Transition NetworX (ATN). Parsers of this sort have 
been discussed by Woods \[ 11\] and Kaplan \[SJ. An 
ATN-IiKe parser was developed by Winograd \ [10 \ ] .  Most 
ATN parsers nave dea l t  primarily wltn syntax, 
occasionally checking a" few simple semantic properties 
of words. A more recent parser wnicn does an isolated 
syntactic parse was created by Marcus \[4\]. TOe 
important thing to note about all of these parsers is 
that they view syntactic parsing as a process to be done 
prior to rea l  understanding.  Even thougn systems of 
this sort at times make use of semantic information, 
they are driven by syntax. Their ~oal of developing a 
syntactic parse tree is not an explicit part of the 
purpcse of human understanding. 
the type o f  understanding done by IPP i s  in some sense a 
compromise between the very detailed understanding of

SAM Ill and P~M \[9\], both of which operated in 
conjunction with ELI, Riesbeck's parser \[SJ, and the 
skimming, h igh ly  top-down, style of FRUMP \[2\]. EL1 was 
a semantically driven parser which maps English language 
sentences into the Conceptual Dependency \[6\] 
representations of their meanings, it made extensive 
use of the semantic properties of the words being 
processed, but interacted only slightly with the rest of 
the understanding processes it was a part of. it would 
pass o f f  a completed Conceptual Dependency 
representation of each sentence to SAM or PAM which 
would try to incorporate it into an overall story 
representation. BOth these programs attempted to 
understand each sentence fully, SAM in terms of scripts, 
PAM in terms of plans and goals, before going onto the 
next sentence. (In \[~\] Scnank and Abelson describe 
scripts, plans and goals.) SAM and PAM model the way 
people might read a story i f  they were expecting a 
detalied test on it, or the way a textbook might be 
read. ?acn program's purpose was to get out of a story 
every piece of informatlon possible, fney treated each 
piece o f  every story as being equally important, ~nd 
requiring total understanding. Both of these programs 
are relatively fragile, requiring compiex dictionary 
entries for every word they might en0ounter, as well as 
extensive Knowledge of the appropriate scripts and 
plans. 
FR?MP, in contrast to SAM and rAM, is a robust system 
whlcn attempts to extract the amount of information from 
a newspaper story which a person gets when ne skims 
rapidly. It does this by selecting a script to 
represent the story and then trying to fill in the 
various slots which are important to understand the 
story. Its purpose is simply to obtain enough 
information from a story to produce a meaningful 
summary. FRUMP i s  s t rong ly  top-down, and wor r ies  about 
incoming information from the story only insofar ~s it 
helps fill In the details of the script which it 
se lec ted .  50 wn i le  FRUMP i s  robust ,  s imply sk ipp ing  
over words it doesn't Know, it does miss interesting 
sections of stories which are  not explained by its 
initial selection of a script. 
18P attempts to model the way people normal ly  read a 
newspaper s to ry .  Unl ike SAM and PAH, i t  does not care 
if it gets every last plece of information out of a 
story. Dull, mundane information is gladly ignored. 
But, In contrast with FRUMP, it does not want to miss 
interesting parts of stories simply because tney do not 
mesh with initial expectations. It tries to create a 
representation which captures the important aspects of 
each story, but also tries to minimize extensive, 
unnecessary processing which does not contrlbute to the 
understanding of the story. 
Thus IFP 's  purpose i s  to decide wnat par ts  o f  a s to ry ,  
i f  any, are in teres t ing  ( in  IPP's  case, that  means 
re la ted  to te r ror i sm) ,  and incorporate  the appropr ia te  
in fo rmat ion  in to  i t s  memory. The concepts used to 
determine what i s  in teres t ing  are an extens ion  o f  ideas 
presented by SctmnK \ [7 \ ] .  
2. How l~  EOA~s 
The u l t imate  purpose o f  reading a newspaper s to ry  i s  to 
i ncorporate  new in format ion  in to  memory. In order  to do 
th i s ,  a number o f  d i f fe rent  Kinds o f  Knowledge are 
needed. The understander must Know the meanings o f  
words, llngulatic rules about now words combine into 
sentences, the conventions used in writing newspaper 
5g 
s tor ies ,  and, c ruc ia l l y ,  have extens ive  knowledge about 
the " rea l  wor ld . "  I t  is  impossible to proper ly  
understand a s tory  without  applying already ex is t ing  
knowledge about the funct ion ing o f  the world.  This 
means the use of  long-term memory cannot be f ru i t fu l l y  
separated  from other  aspects  o f  the  natura l  
unders tand in~ problem. The mana~emant o f  a l l  th i s  
in fo rmat ion  by an unders tander  i s  a c r i t i ca l  problem In 
comprehens ion,  s ince  the  app l i ca t ion  o f  a l l  potent ia l l y  
re levant  Knowledge a l l  the t ime, would ser ious ly  degrade 
the understandin~ process, possibly to the point of 
ha l t ing  I t  a l together .  In our model of  unders tand ing ,  
the ro le  played by the in teres ts  of the understander Is  
to a l low deta i led  processing to occur only on the parts  
of the s tory  which are Important to overa l l  
understanding, thereby conserving processing resources.  
Cent ra l  to any unders tand in~ system i s  the type of  
Knowledge s t ruc ture  used to represent s to r ies .  At the 
present time, IPP represents stories in terms of scripts 
similar to ,  a l though simpler than, those used by SAM and 
FRUMP. Most of the co--on events In I PP ' s  area of 
I n te res t ,  te r ro r i sm,  such as hi Jaokings,  kidnappings, 
and ambushes, are reasonanly stereotyped,  although not 
necessarily wltn a l l  the temporal sequencing present in  
the scripts SAM uses. ZPP also represents some events 
d i rec t ly  In Conceptual Dependency. The representat ions  
in IPP cons ist  of  two types of  s t ruc tures .  There are 
the event s t ruc tures  themselves, genera l ly  sc r ip ts  such 
as $KIDNAP and SAMBUSH, which form the backbone of  the 
s tory  representat ions ,  and tokens which f i l l  the ro les  
in the event structures. These tokens are basically the 
? tc ture  Producers o f  \ [6 \ ] ,  and represent the concepts 
underly ing words such as "a i r l iner , "  "machine-gun" and 
"Kidnapper."  The f ina l  s to ry  representat ion  can also 
Include l inks  between event s t ruc tures  ind icat ing  
causal ,  temporal and scr ipt -scene re la t ionsh ips .  
Due to IPP's l im i ted  reper to i re  o f  s t ruc tures  wi th which 
to represent events,  i t  is  cur rent ly  unable to fu l l y  
understand some s tor ies  which maXe sense only in  terms 
o f  goals and plans, or other  higher leve l  
representat ions .  However, the understanding techniques 
used in IPP should be applicable to s tor ies  which 
requ i re  the use of  such knowledge s t ruc tures .  This i s  a 
top ic  o f  current  research.  
It Is worth noting that the form of a story's 
representation may depend on the purpose behind its 
being read. I f  the reader is  only mi ld ly  In teres ted  in 
the subject o f  the s to ry ,  sor ip ta l  representat ion  may 
wel l  be adequate. On the other  hand, fo r  an s tory  o f  
great in teres t  to the reader,  add i t iona l  e f fo r t  may be 
expended to a l low the goals and plans o f  the actors  In  
the s tory  to be gorked out .  This I s  genera l ly  more 
complex than simply represent ing a story in terms of  
s te reotyp ica l  knowledge,  and wi l l  only be a t tempted  in 
cases of great interest. 
In order to achieve i t s  purpose, ~PP does extens ive 
"top-down" processing. That Is, It makes predlotions 
aOout what i t  i s  l i ke ly  to  see. These pred ic t ions  range 
from low- leve l ,  syntact i c  p red ic t ions  ( " the  next noun 
phrase w i l l  be the person kidnapped," fo r  instance) to 
qui te  h igh- leve l ,  g lobal  p red ic t ions ,  ("expect  to see 
demands made by the te r ror i s t " ) .  S ign i f i cant ly ,  the 
program only  makes pred ic t ions  about th ings  i t  would 
l i ke  to Know. I t  doesn't  mind skipping over unimportant 
parts  of  the text .  
The top-down pred ic t ions  made by IPP are implemented in 
terms o f  requests,  s imi la r  to those used by RiesbecK 
\[5\], which are basically Just test-action pairs. While 
such an implementation In theory allows arbitrary 
computat ions  to ~e per formed,  the  ac t ions  used in  IPP 
are in fact quite limited. IPP requests can build an 
event s t ruc ture ,  l ink  event s t ructures  together ,  use a 
token to f i l l  a ro le  in  an event  s t ruc ture ,  ac t ivate  new 
requests  or de-act ivate  other act ive  requests. 
The tests in IPP requests are also llmited in nature. 
They can look for certain types of events or tokens, 
check fo r  words with a spec i f ied  property in the i r  
d ic t ionary  ent ry ,  or  even check for spec i f i c  lex ica l  
i tems.  The tes ts  fo r  lex ica l  i tems are  qu i te  Impor tant  
in  Keeping IPP ' s  p rocess ing  e f f i c ient .  One advantage  i s  
that  very  spec i f i c  top-down pred ic t ions  w i l l  o f ten  a l low 
an otherwise very complex word d isa~biguat ion process to 
be bypassed. For example, in a s tory  about a h i jack ing ,  
ZPP expects the word "car ry ing"  to i nd icate  that  the 
passengers  o f  the  h i jacked  veh ic le  a re  to fo l low.  So i t  
never  has to cons ider  An any deta i l  the  meaning o f  
"car ry ing . "  Many funct ion  words rea l ly  nave no meaning 
by themselves, and the type o f  p red ic t ive  processing 
used by IPP is  c ruc ia l  in handling them e f f i c ient ly .  
Despite i t s  top-down or ientat ion ,  IPP does not ignore 
unexpected Input .  Rather, If the new Information is 
i n te res t ing  in i t se l f  the program wi l l  concentrate on 
i t ,  makin~ new pred ic t ions  In add i t ion  to ,  or instead 
o f ,  the or ig ina l  ones. The proper in tegrat ion  o f  
top-down and bottom-up processing al lows the program to 
be e f f i c ient ,  and yet not miss in teres t ing ,  unexpected 
in format ion .  
The bottom-up process in~ of  IPP i s  based around a 
u lass i f i ca t ion  o f  words that  i s  done s t r i c t ly  on the  
basis of  processing considerations. IPP Is interested 
in the traditional syntactic classifications only when 
they help determine how worqs should be processed. 
IPP's c r i te r ia  fo r  c lass i f i ca t ion  Involve the type of  
data  s t ruc tures  words bu i ld ,  and when they shou ld  be 
processed. 
Words can bu i ld  e i ther  o f  the  main data  s t ruc tures  used 
in XPP, events  and tokens .  The words bu l ld in~ events  
are  usua l ly  verbs ,  but many syntact i c  nouns,  such as  
? k idnapping,"  " r io t , "  and "demonstrat ion" a lso ind icate  
events, and are handled in Just the same way as 
t rad i t iona l  verbs .  Some words,  such as  =oat ad jec t ives  
and adverbs ,  do not bu i ld  s t ruc tures  but ra ther  modi fy  
s t ruc tures  bu i l t  by other  words. These words are 
handled accord ing  to the  type o f  s t ruc ture  they modi fy .  
The second c r i te r ia  fo r  c lass i fy ing  words - when they 
should be processed - is  c ruc ia l  to 1PP's operat ion .  In 
order to model a rap id ,  normal ly paced reader,  IPP 
attempts to avoid doin~ any processing which w i l l  not 
add to i t s  overa l l  understandin~ o f  a s to ry .  To do 
th i s ,  i t  c lass i f ies  words in to  three groups - words 
which must be fu l l y  processed i - -ed la te ly ,  words which 
should be saved in shor t - te r~ memory, and then processed 
la ter ,  i f  ne,=essary, and words which should be skipped 
ent i re ly .  
Words which must be processed immediately include 
in teres t ing  words bu i ld ing e i ther  event s t ruc tures  or  
tokens. "Gunmen," "kidnapped" and "exploded" are 
typ ica l  examples. These words give us the overa l l  
framework o f  a s to ry ,  ind icate  how much e f fo r t  should 0e 
devoted to fu r ther  ana lys is ,  and, most impor tant ly ,  
generate the pred ic t ions  w~loh a l low la ter  processing to 
proceed efficiently. 
The save and process la ter  words are those which may 
become s i~n i f ioant  la ter ,  but are not obvious ly  
impor~cant when they are read. This c lass is  qu i te  
substant ia l ,  Inc luding many du l l  nouns and near ly  a l l  
ad jec t ives  and adverbs .  Zn a noun phrase  sucn as  
"numerous I ta l ian  gunmen," there I s  no po in t  in 
processing tO any depth "numerous" or " I ta l ian"  unt i l  we 
~now the word they modify is Important enou~n to be 
included in the f ina l  representat ion .  Zn the cases 
where fu r ther  procesein~ is  necessary, IPP has the 
proper in format ion  to eas i ly  incorporate the saved words 
In to  the s tory  representat ion ,  and In the many cases 
60 
where the word is not important, no effort above saving 
the word is required. The processin~ strategy for these 
words is a Key to modei~n~ nom,al reading. 
The final class of words are those IPP skips altogether. 
Thls class includes very unlnterestln~ words whlch 
neither cont r ibute  processing clues, nor add to the 
story representation. Many function words, adjectives 
and verbs irrelevant to the domain at hand, and most 
pronouns fa l l  into this category. These words can still 
be significant in cases where they are predlcted, but 
otherwise they are ignored by IPP and take no processln~ 
effort. 
In addition to the processing techniques mentioned so 
far, IPP makes use of several very pragmatic heuristics. 
These are particularly important in processlng noun 
~roups properly. An example of the type of heuristic 
used is IPP's assumption that the first actor in a story 
tends to be important, and is worth extra processing 
effort. Other heurlst~cs can be seen in the example In 
section ~. IP~'s basic strategy is to make reasonable 
guesses about the appropriate representation as qulcKly 
as possible, facilitating later processln~ and f i x  
things later if its ~uesses are prove to be wrong. 
~. ~ DETAILED ~XAMPLE 
~n order to illustrate bow IPP operates, and how its 
purpose affects its process|n{, an annotated run of IPP 
on a typical story, one taken from the Boston Globe is 
shown below. The text between the rows of stars has 
been added to explain the operation of IPP. Items 
beginning with a do l la r  s ign ,  such as $rERRORISM, 
indicate scripts used by IPP to represent events.

GUNMEN is marked In the dlotionary as inherently 
interesting. In humans this presumably occurs after a 
reader has noted that  stories i nvo lv ing  gunmen tend to 
be interesting. Since it is interesting, IPP fully 
processes GUNMEN, Knowing that it Is important to its 
purpose of extracting the significant content of the 
story, it builds a token to represent the GUNMEN and 
makes several predlctlons to facilitate later 
processing. There is a strong possibility that some 
verb conceptually equivalent to "shoot" will appear. 
There are also a set of scripts, i nc lud ing  SROBBERY, 
STERRORISM and $HIJACK wnlcn are likely to appear, so 
IPP creates predictions looking for clues indicating 
that one of these scripts sOould be activated and used 
to represent the story.

script is Inferred, and $SHOOT attacned to i t  as a

make inferences which are relevant to any case of a 
person being attacked, not just snootin~s. IPP is still 
not able to Instantiate any of the high level scripts

IPP <nows the word AMBUSH to indicate an instance of the 
SAMBUSH scr|pt, and tn~t SAMBUSH can be a scene of 
$TERRORISM (i.e. it is an activity w~Ich can be 
construed as a terrorist act). This causes the 
pred ic t ion  made by GUNMEN that  $TERRORISM was a poss ib le

in fe r red  that a l l  the scenes o f  the event took place at 
the same locat ion .  IPP expends e f fo r t  in ident i fy ing  
this role, as location is crucial to the understandln~ 
of most storles. It is also important in the 
or~anizatlon of memories about  stories. A incidence of 
te r ro r i sm in Northern i re land is understood d i f fe rent ly  
from one in New York or Geneva.

As it pro~esses a story such as this one, IPF keeps 
track of how interesting it feels the story is. Novelty 
and relevance tend to increase interestlngness, while 
redundancy and i r re levance  dec?ease i t .  For example, in  
the s tory  shown moore, the faot  that  the victim of  the 
shooting was an 8 year -o ld  ingresses the in teres t  o f  the 
s tory ,  and the the inc ident  taMin~ place in Northern 
I re land as opposed to a more unusual sate fo r  te r ro r i sm 
decreases the in teres t .  The s tory ' s  in teres t  I s  used to 
determine how much e f fo r t  should be expended in t ry in~ 
to f i l l  in more deta i l s  o f  t~e s tory .  I f  the leve l  o f  
ln teres t ingness  decreases fax' enough, the program can 
stop processing the s tory ,  and look for a more 
i n te res t ing  one, in the same way a person does when 
reading through a newspaper.

Thls example maces several interesting points about the 
way IPP operates. Notice that  1PP has jumped to a 
conclusion about the story,, which, while plausible, 
could easily be wrong, it assumes that the actor of the 
SBOMB and SATTACK-PLACE scripts is the same as the actor 
of the STERRORISM script, which was in turn inferred 
from the actor of the sbootln~ incident. Tnls is 
plausible, as normally news stories are about  a coherent 
set of events witn lo~Ical relations amongst them. So 
it is reasonable for a s tory  to De about a series of 
related acts  of terrorism, committed by the same person 
or  ~roup, and tnat  i s  what IPP assumes here even though 
that may not be correct. Uut this ~Ind of inference is 
exact ly  the Kind which IPP must make in order to do 
efficient top-down processln~, despite the possibility 
of errors. 
The otner interesting point about tnis example is the 
way some of iPP's quite pragmatic heuristics for 
processln~ give positive results. For instance, as 
mentioned earlier, the first actor mentioned has a 
stronz tendency to be important to the understandln~ of 
a story. In thls story that means that the modlfyin~ 
prepositional phrase "of former President Su~enlo Kjell 
Lau~erud" is analyzed and attached to the token built 
for "son," usua l ly  not an interesting word. Heur~stlcs 
of this sort ~ive IPP its power and robustness, rather 
than any single rule about language understandln~. 
5. CONCLUSION 
IPP has been implemented on a DECsystem 20/50 at Yale.  
It currently has a vocabulary of more than I~00 words 
wnlcn is oelng continually Increased in an attempt to 
make the program an expert underst~der  of newspaper 
stories scout terrorism. ?t is also planned to add 
information about nigher l eve l  knowledge structures such 
as ~oals and plans and expand IPP 's  domain o f  interest. 
To date, IPP has successfully processed over 50 stories 
taken directly from various newspapers, many sight 
unseen.  
The difference between the powers of IPP and the 
syntactlcally driven parsers mentioned earller can cent 
be seen by the Kinds o f  sentences they  hand le .  
Syntax-0ased parsers  genera l ly  deal w i th  re la t ive ly  
s imple ,  syntact i ca l ly  we l l - fo rmed sentences .  IPP 
handles sucn sentences, Out also accurately processes 
stories taken directly from newspapers, which of ten  
invo lve  ext remely  convo lu ted  syntax ,  and in many cases 
are not  grammatical  at  a l l .  Sentences o f  th i s  type  are 
difficult, if not impossible for parsers relyln~ on 
syntax. IPP is so le  to process news stories quickly, on 
the order of 2 CPU seconds, and when done, it has 
achieved a complete understandln~ of the story, not Just 
a syntactic parse. 
As shown in tne examples above, interest can provide a 
purpose for reading newspaper stories. In other 
situations, other factors might provide the purpose. 
But the purpose is never simply to create a 
representation - especially a representation with no 
semantic content, such as a syntax tree. This is not to 
say syntax is not important, obviously in many 
circumstances it provides crucial information, but it 
should not drive the understanding process. Preliminary 
representations are needed only if they assist in the 
reader's ultimate purpose bulldln~ an appropriate, 
high-level representation which can be incorporated with 
already existing Knowledge. The results achieved by IPP 
indicate that parsing directly into high-level knowledge 
structures is possible, and in many situations may well 
be more practical than first doin~ a low-level parse. 
Its integrated approacn allows IPP to make use of all 
the various kinds of knowledge which people use when 
unders tandtn~ a story.
