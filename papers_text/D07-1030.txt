Abstract 
This paper proposes a method using the ex-
isting Rule-based Machine Translation 
(RBMT) system as a black box to produce 
synthetic bilingual corpus, which will be 
used as training data for the Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT) system. We use 
the existing RBMT system to translate the 
monolingual corpus into synthetic bilingual 
corpus. With the synthetic bilingual corpus, 
we can build an SMT system even if there 
is no real bilingual corpus. In our experi-
ments using BLEU as a metric, the system 
achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% 
over the best RBMT system that is used to 
produce the synthetic bilingual corpora. 
We also interpolate the model trained on a 
real bilingual corpus and the models 
trained on the synthetic bilingual corpora. 
The interpolated model achieves an abso-
lute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score 
(13.1% relative) as compared with the in-
dividual model trained on the real bilingual 
corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Within the Machine Translation (MT) field, by far 
the most dominant paradigm is SMT, but many 
existing commercial systems are rule-based. In this 
research, we are interested in answering the ques-
tion of whether the existing RBMT systems could 
be helpful to the development of an SMT system. 
To find the answer, let us first consider the follow-
ing facts: 
? Existing RBMT systems are usually pro-
vided as a black box. To make use of such 
systems, the most convenient way might 
be working on the translation results di-
rectly. 
? SMT methods rely on bilingual corpus. As 
a data driven method, SMT usually needs 
large bilingual corpus as the training data. 
Based on the above facts, in this paper we pro-
pose a method using the existing RBMT system as 
a black box to produce a synthetic bilingual cor-
pus1, which will be used as the training data for the 
SMT system. 
For a given language pair, the monolingual cor-
pus is usually much larger than the real bilingual 
corpus. We use the existing RBMT system to 
translate the monolingual corpus into synthetic 
bilingual corpus. Then, even if there is no real bi-
lingual corpus, we can train an SMT system with 
the monolingual corpus and the synthetic bilingual 
corpus. If there exist n available RBMT systems 
for the desired language pair, we use the n systems 
to produce n synthetic bilingual corpora, and n 
translation models are trained with the n corpora 
respectively. We name such a model the synthetic 
model. An interpolated translation model is built 
by linear interpolating the n synthetic models. In 
our experiments using BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) 
as the metric, the interpolated synthetic model 
achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the 
best RBMT system that is used to produce the syn-
thetic bilingual corpora.  
                                                 
1 In this paper, to be distinguished from the real bilingual cor-
pus, the bilingual corpus generated by the RBMT system is 
called a synthetic bilingual corpus.  
287
Moreover, if a real bilingual corpus is available 
for the desired language pair, we build another 
translation model, which is named the standard 
model. Then we can build an interpolated model 
by interpolating the standard model and the syn-
thetic models. Experimental results show that the 
interpolated model achieves an absolute improve-
ment of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as 
compared with the standard model. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2 we summarize the related work. 
We then describe our method Using RBMT sys-
tems to produce bilingual corpus for SMT in sec-
tion 3. Section 4 describes the resources used in the 
experiments. Section 5 presents the experiment 
result, followed by the discussion in section 6. Fi-
nally, we conclude and present the future work in 
section 7. 
2 Related Work 
In the MT field, by far the most dominant 
paradigm is SMT. SMT has evolved from the 
original word-based approach (Brown et al, 1993) 
into phrase-based approaches (Koehn et al, 2003; 
Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based approaches 
(Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al, 2000; Yamada and 
Knignt, 2001; Chiang, 2005). On the other hand, 
much important work continues to be carried out in 
Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) 
(Carl et al, 2005; Way and Gough, 2005), and 
many existing commercial systems are rule-based. 
Although we are not aware of any previous at-
tempt to use an existing RBMT system as a black 
box to produce synthetic bilingual training corpus 
for general purpose SMT systems, there exists a 
great deal of work on MT hybrids and Multi-
Engine Machine Translation (MEMT). 
Research into MT hybrids has increased over the 
last few years. Some research focused on the hy-
brid of various corpus-based MT methods, such as 
SMT and EBMT (Vogel and Ney, 2000; Marcu, 
2001; Groves and Way, 2006; Menezes and Quirk, 
2005). Others tried to exploit the advantages of 
both rule-based and corpus-based methods. Habash 
et al (2006) built an Arabic-English generation-
heavy MT system and boosted it with SMT com-
ponents. METIS-II is a hybrid machine translation 
system, in which insights from SMT, EBMT, and 
RBMT are used (Vandeghinste et al, 2006). Seneff 
et al (2006) combined an interlingual translation 
framework with phrase-based SMT for spoken 
language translation in a limited domain. They 
automatically generated a corpus of English-
Chinese pairs from the same interlingual represen-
tation by parsing the English corpus and then para-
phrasing each utterance into both English and Chi-
nese. 
Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) produced the 
first MEMT system by combining outputs from 
three different MT engines based on their knowl-
edge of the inner workings of the engines. Nomoto 
(2004) used voted language models to select the 
best output string at sentence level. Some recent 
approaches to MEMT used word alignment tech-
niques for comparison between the MT systems 
(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Zaanen and Somers, 
2005; Matusov et al 2006). All the above MEMT 
systems operate on MT outputs for complete input 
sentences. Mellebeek et al (2006) presented a dif-
ferent approach, using a recursive decomposition 
algorithm that produces simple chunks as input to 
the MT engines. A consensus translation is pro-
duced by combining the best chunk translation. 
This paper uses RBMT outputs to improve the 
performance of SMT systems. Instead of RBMT 
outputs, other researchers have used SMT outputs 
to boost translation quality. Callision-Burch and 
Osborne (2003) used co-training to extend existing 
parallel corpora, wherein machine translations are 
selectively added to training corpora with multiple 
source texts. They also created training data for a 
language pair without a parallel corpus by using 
multiple source texts. Ueffing (2006) explored 
monolingual source-language data to improve an 
existing machine translation system via self-
training. The source data is translated by a SMT 
system, and the reliable translations are automati-
cally identified. Both of the methods improved 
translation quality. 
3 Method 
In this paper, we use the synthetic and real bilin-
gual corpus to train the phrase-based translation 
models. 
3.1  Phrase-Based Models

(Koehn et al, 2003), given a source sentence f ,

3.2 Interpolated Models 
We train synthetic models with the synthetic bilin-

can also train a translation model, namely standard 
model, if a real bilingual corpus is available. In 
order to make full use of these two kinds of cor-
pora, we conduct linear interpolation between them. 
In this paper, the distortion probability in equa-
tion (2) is estimated during decoding, using the 
same method as described in Pharaoh (Koehn, 
2004). For the phrase translation probability and 
lexical weight, we interpolate them as shown in (3)

4 Resources Used in Experiments 
4.1 Data 
In the experiments, we take English-Chinese trans-
lation as a case study. The real bilingual corpus 
includes 494,149 English-Chinese bilingual sen-
tence pairs. The monolingual English corpus is 
selected from the English Gigaword Second Edi-
tion, which is provided by Linguistic Data Consor-
tium (LDC) (catalog number LDC2005T12). The 
selected monolingual corpus includes 1,087,651 
sentences. 
For language model training, we use part of the 
Chinese Gigaword Second Edition provided by 
LDC (catalog number LDC2005T14). We use 
41,418 documents selected from the ZaoBao 
Newspaper and 992,261 documents from the Xin-
Hua News Agency to train the Chinese language 
model, amounting to 5,398,616 sentences. 
The test set and the development set are from 
the corpora distributed for the 2005 HTRDP 2  
evaluation of machine translation.  It can be ob-
tained from Chinese Linguistic Data Consortium 
(catalog number 2005-863-001). We use the same 
494 sentences in the test set and 278 sentences in 
the development set. Each source sentence in the 
test set and the development set has 4 different ref-
erences. 
4.2 Tools 
In this paper, we use two off-the-shelf commercial 
English to Chinese RBMT systems to produce the 
synthetic bilingual corpus. 
We also need a trainer and a decoder to perform 
phrase-based SMT. We use Koehn's training 
scripts 3  to train the translation model, and the 
SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train language 
model. For the decoder, we use Pharaoh (Koehn, 
2004). We run the decoder with its default settings 
(maximum phrase length 7) and then use Koehn's 
implementation of minimum error rate training 
(Och, 2003) to tune the feature weights on the de-

velopment set. The translation quality is evaluated 
using a well-established automatic measure: BLEU 
score (Papineni et al, 2002). We use the same 
method described in (Koehn and Monz, 2006) to 
perform the significance test. 
5 Experimental Results 
5.1 Results on Synthetic Corpus Only 
With the monolingual English corpus and the Eng-
lish side of the real bilingual corpus, we translate 
them into Chinese using the two commercial 
RBMT systems and produce two synthetic bilin-
gual corpora. With the corpora, we train two syn-
thetic models as described in section 3.1. Based on 
the synthetic models, we also perform linear inter-
polation as shown in section 3.2, without the stan-
dard models. We tune the interpolation weights 
using the development set, and achieve the best 
performance when 58.01 =? , 42.02 =? , 
58.01 =? , and 42.02 =? . The translation results 
on the test set are shown in Table 1. Synthetic 
model 1 and 2 are trained using the synthetic bilin-
gual corpora produced by RBMT system 1 and 
RBMT system 2, respectively.

Table 1. Translation Results Using Synthetic Bi-
lingual Corpus 
From the results, it can be seen that the interpo-
lated synthetic model obtains the best result, with 
an absolute improvement of the 0.0197 BLEU 
(11.7% relative) as compared with RBMT system 
1, and 0.0425 BLEU (29.2% relative) as compared 
with RBMT system 2. It is very promising that our 
method can build an SMT system that significantly 
outperforms both of the two RBMT systems, using 
the synthetic bilingual corpus produced by two 
RBMT systems. 
5.2 Results on Real and Synthetic Corpus 
With the real bilingual corpus, we build a standard 
model. We interpolate the standard model with the 
two synthetic models built in section 5.1 to obtain 
interpolated models. The translation results are 
shown in Table 2. The interpolation coefficients 
are both for phrase table probabilities and lexical 
weights. They are also tuned using the develop-
ment set.  
From the results, it can be seen that all the three 
interpolated models perform not only better than 
the RBMT systems but also better than the SMT 
system trained on the real bilingual corpus. The 
interpolated model combining the standard model 
and the two synthetic models performs the best, 
achieving a statistically significant improvement of 
about 0.0245 BLEU (13.1% relative) as compared 
with the standard model with no synthetic corpus. 
It also achieves 26.1% and 45.8% relative im-
provement as compared with the two RBMT sys-
tems respectively. The results indicate that using 
the corpus produced by RBMT systems, the per-
formance of the SMT system can be greatly im-
proved. The results also indicate that the more the 
RBMT systems are used, the better the translation 
quality is.

5.3 Effect of Synthetic Corpus Size 
To explore the relationship between the translation 
quality and the scale of the synthetic bilingual cor-
pus, we interpolate the standard model with the 
synthetic models trained with synthetic bilingual 
corpus of different sizes. In order to simplify the 
procedure, we only use RBMT system 1 to trans-
late the 1,087,651 monolingual English sentences 
to produce the synthetic bilingual corpus.  
We randomly select 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 
100% of the synthetic bilingual corpus to train dif-
ferent synthetic models. The translation results of 
the interpolated models are shown in Figure 1. The 
results indicate that the larger the synthetic bilin-
gual corpus is, the better translation performance 
would be.

Another issue is the relationship between the SMT 
performance and the size of the real bilingual cor-
pus. To train different standard models, we ran-
domly build five corpora of different sizes, which 
contain 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% sentence 
pairs of the real bilingual corpus, respectively. As 
to the synthetic model, we use the same synthetic 
model 1 that is described in section 5.1. Then we 
build five interpolated models by performing linear 
interpolation between the synthetic model and the 
five standard models respectively.  The translation 
results are shown in Figure 2.

From the results, we can see that the larger the 
real bilingual corpus is, the better the performance 
of both standard models and interpolated models 
would be. The relative improvement of BLEU 
scores is up to 27.5% as compared with the corre-
sponding standard models. 
Table 4. Numbers of Phrase Pairs  5.5 Results without Additional Monolingual 
Corpus cant improvement of about 0.01 BLEU (5.2% rela-
tive) as compared with the standard model without 
using the synthetic corpus. In all the above experiments, we use an additional English monolingual corpus to get more synthetic 
bilingual corpus. We are also interested in the re-
sults without the additional monolingual corpus. In 
such case, the only English monolingual corpus is 
the English side of the real bilingual corpus. We 
use this smaller size of monolingual corpus and the 
real bilingual corpus to conduct similar experi-
ments as in section 5.2. The translation results are 
shown in Table 3. 
In order to further analyze the translation results, 
we examine the overlap and the difference among 
the phrase tables. The analytic results are shown in 
Table 4. More phrase pairs are extracted by the 
synthetic models, about twice by the synthetic 
model 1 in particular, than those extracted by the 
standard model. The overlap between each model 
is very low. For example, about 6% phrase pairs 
extracted by the standard model make appearance 
in both the standard model and the synthetic model 
1. This also explains why the interpolated model 
outperforms that of the standard model in Table 3.  
From the results, it can be seen that our method 
works well even if no additional monolingual cor-
pus is available. We achieve a statistically signifi-

6 Discussion 
6.1 Model Interpolation vs. Corpus Merge 
In section 5, we make use of the real bilingual cor-
pus and the synthetic bilingual corpora by perform-
ing model interpolation. Another available way is 
directly combining these two kinds of corpora to 
train a translation model, namely corpus merge. In 
order to compare these two methods, we use 
RBMT system 1 to translate the 1,087,651 mono-
lingual English sentences to produce synthetic bi-
lingual corpus. Then we train an SMT system with 
the combination of this synthetic bilingual corpus 
and the real bilingual corpus. The BLEU score of 
such system is 0.1887, while that of the model in-
terpolation system is 0.2020. It indicates that the 
model interpolation method is significantly better 
than the corpus merge method. 
6.2 Result Analysis 
As discussed in Section 5.5, the number of the 
overlapped phrase pairs among the standard model 
and the synthetic models is very small. The newly 
added phrase pairs from the synthetic models can 
assist to improve the translation results of the in-
terpolated model. In this section, we will use an 
example to further discuss the reason behind the 
improvement of the SMT system by using syn-
thetic bilingual corpus. Table 5 shows an English 
sentence and its Chinese translations produced by 
different methods. And Figure 3 shows the phrase 
pairs used for translation. The results show that 
imperfect translations of RBMT systems can be 
also used to boost the performance of an SMT sys-
tem.

Table 6. Statistics of Phrase Pairs 
Further analysis is shown in Table 6. After add-
ing the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT 
systems, the interpolated model outperforms the 
standard models mainly for the following two rea-
sons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added into the 
interpolated model. 37.6% phrase pairs (1993 out 
of 5306) are newly learned and used for translation. 
For example, the phrase pair "after-sale service <-> 
???? (shouhoufuwu)" is added; (2) The prob-
ability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed. 
For example, the probabilities of the two pairs "a 
brand name <-> ?? (pinpai)" and "and the crea-
tion of <-> ? ?? (he chuangzao)" increase. The 
probabilities of the other two pairs "brand name <-
> ?? (pinpai)" and "and the creation of a <-> ? 
??  (he jianli)" decrease. We found that 930 
phrase pairs, which are also in the phrase table of 
the standard model, are used by the interpolated 
model for translation but not used by the standard 
model. 
6.3 Human Evaluation 
According to (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-
Burch et al, 2006), the RBMT systems are usually 
not adequately appreciated by BLEU. We also 
manually evaluated the RBMT systems and SMT 
systems in terms of both adequacy and fluency as 
defined in (Koehn and Monz, 2006). The evalua-
tion results show that the SMT system with the 
interpolated model, which achieves the highest 
BLEU scores in Table 2, achieves slightly better 
adequacy and fluency scores than the two RBMT 
systems. 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
We presented a method using the existing RBMT 
system as a black box to produce synthetic bilin-
gual corpus, which was used as training data for 
the SMT system. We used the existing RBMT sys-
tem to translate the monolingual corpus into a syn-
thetic bilingual corpus. With the synthetic bilingual 
corpus, we could build an SMT system even if 
there is no real bilingual corpus. In our experi-
ments using BLEU as the metric, such a system 
achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the 
best RBMT system that is used to produce the syn-
thetic bilingual corpora. It indicates that using the 
existing RBMT systems to produce a synthetic bi-
lingual corpus, we can build an SMT system that 
outperforms the existing RBMT systems. 
We also interpolated the model trained on a real 
bilingual corpus and the models trained on the syn-
thetic bilingual corpora, the interpolated model 
achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 
BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the 
individual model trained on the real bilingual cor-
293
pus. It indicates that we can build a better SMT 
system by leveraging the real and the synthetic bi-
lingual corpus. 
Further result analysis shows that after adding 
the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT sys-
tems, the interpolated model outperforms the stan-
dard models mainly because of two reasons: (1) 
some new phrase pairs are added to the interpo-
lated model; (2) the probability distribution of the 
phrase pairs is changed. 
In the future work, we will investigate the possi-
bility of training a reverse SMT system with the 
RBMT systems. For example, we will investigate 
to train Chinese-to-English SMT system based on 
natural English and RBMT-generated synthetic 
Chinese.
