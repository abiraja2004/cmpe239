Abstract 
In order to boost the translation quality of 
EBMT based on a small-sized bilingual cor-
pus, we use an out-of-domain bilingual corpus 
and, in addition, the language model of an in-
domain monolingual corpus. We conducted 
experiments with an EBMT system. The two 
evaluation measures of the BLEU score and 
the NIST score demonstrated the effect of us-
ing an out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the 
possibility of using the language model. 
1 Introduction 
Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) is adapt-
able to new domains. If you simply prepare a bilingual 
corpus of a new domain, you?ll get a translation system 
for the domain. However, if only a small-sized corpus is 
available, low translation quality is obtained. We ex-
plored methods to boost translation quality based on a 
small-sized bilingual corpus in the domain. Among 
these methods, we use an out-of-domain bilingual cor-
pus and, in addition, the language model (LM) of an in-
domain monolingual corpus. For accuracy of the LM, a 
larger training set is better. The training set is a target 
language corpus, which can be more easily prepared 
than a bilingual corpus. 
In prior works, statistical machine translation 
(Brown, 1993) used not only LM but also translation 
models. However, making a translation model requires a 
bilingual corpus. On the other hand, in some studies on 
multiple-translation selection, the LM of the target lan-
guage is used to calculate translation scores (Kaki, 
1999; Callison-Burch, 2001). For adaptation, we use the 
LM of an in-domain target language. 
In the following sections, we describe the methods 
using an out-of-domain bilingual corpus and an in-
domain monolingual corpus. Moreover, we report on 
our experiments. 
2 Adaptation Methods 
EBMT (Nagao, 1984) retrieves the translation ex-
amples that are most similar to an input expression and 
adjusts the examples to obtain the translation. The 
EBMT system in our approach retrieves not only in-
domain examples, but also out-of-domain examples. 
When using out-of-domain examples, suitability to the 
target domain is considered. We tried the following 
three types of adaptation methods. 
 
(1) Merging equally 
 
An in-domain corpus and an out-of-domain corpus are 
simply merged and used without distinction. 
 
(2) Merging with preference for in-domain corpus 
 
An in-domain corpus and an out-of-domain corpus are 
merged. However, when multiple examples with the 
same similarity are retrieved, the in-domain examples 
are used. 
 
(3) Using LM 
 
Beforehand, we make an LM of an in-domain target 
language corpus and, according to the LM, assign a 
probability to the target sentence of each out-of-domain 
example. 
In the example retrieval phase of the EBMT system, 
two types of examples are handled differently.  
 
(3-1) From in-domain examples, the most similar exam-
ples are retrieved. 
(3-2) From out-of-domain examples, not only the most 
similar examples but also other examples that are 
nearly as similar are retrieved. In the retrieved ex-
amples, examples with the highest probabilities of 
their target sentences by the LM are selected. 
(3-3) From the results of both (3-1) and (3-2), the most 
similar examples are selected. Examples of (3-1) are 
used when the similarities are equal to each other. 
3 Translation Experiments 
3.1 Conditions 
In order to evaluate the adaptability of an EBMT with 
out-of-domain examples, we applied the methods de-
scribed in Section 2 to the EBMT and evaluated the 
translation quality in Japanese-to-English translation. 
We used an EBMT, DP-match Driven transDucer (D3, 
Sumita, 2001)  as a test bed. 
We used two Japanese-and-English bilingual cor-
pora. In this experiment on adaptation, as an out-of-
domain corpus, we used Basic Travel Expression Cor-
pus (BTEC, described as BE-corpus in Takezawa, 
2002); as an in-domain corpus,  we used a telephone 
conversation corpus (TEL). The statistics of the corpora 
are shown in Table 1. TEL is split into two parts: a  test 
set of 1,653 sentence pairs and a training set of 9,918. 
Perplexities reveal the large difference between the in-
domain and out-of-domain corpora. 
 
 
 
 
The translation qualities were evaluated by the 
BLEU score (Papineni, 2001) and the NIST score 
(Doddington, 2002). The evaluation methods compare 
the system output translation with a set of reference 
translations of the same source text by  finding se-
quences of words in the reference translations that 
match those in the system output translation. We used  
the English sentence corresponding to each input Japa-
nese sentence in the test set as the reference translation. 
Therefore, achieving a better score by the evaluation 
means that the translation results can be regarded  as  
more adequate translations for the domain. 
In order to simulate incremental expansion of an in-
domain bilingual corpus and to observe the relationship 
between corpus size and translation quality, translations 
were performed with some subsets of the training cor-
pus. The numbers of the sentence pairs are 0, 1000, .. , 
5000 and 9918, adding randomly selected examples 
from the training set. 
The LM of the domain?s target language was the 
word trigram model of the English sentences of the 
training set of TEL. We tried two patterns of training set 
quantities in making the LM: 1) all of the training set, 
and 2) the part of the set used for translation examples 
according to the numbers mentioned above. 
3.2 Results 
Table 2 shows the BLEU scores from the translation 
experiment, which show certain tendencies. Generally, 
by using more in-domain examples, the translation re-
sults steadily achieve better scores. The score when us-
ing 4,000 in-domain examples exceeded that when 
using 152,172 out-of-domain examples. Equal merging 
outperformed using only out-of-domain examples. 
Merging with in-domain preference outperformed equal 
merging, and using LM outperformed merging with in-
domain preference. Comparing the two cases using LM, 
using LM made from all of the training set got a slightly 
better scores than the other, which implies that better 
LM is made from a larger corpus. All of the adaptation 
methods are more effective when a smaller-sized in-
domain corpus is available. When using no in-domain 
examples, the effect of using LM made from the entire 
training set was relatively large. 
Table 3 shows the NIST scores for the same experi-
ment. We can observe the same tendencies as in the 
table of BLEU scores, except that the advantage of us-
ing LM made from all of the training set over that from 
a partial set was not observed. 
4 Conclusion and Future Work 
A corpus-based approach is able to quickly build a ma-
chine translation system for a new domain if a bilingual 
corpus of that domain is available. However, if only a 
small-sized corpus is available, a low translation quality 
is obtained. In order to boost the performance, several 
methods using out-of-domain data were explored in this 
paper. The experimental results showed the effect of 
using an out-of-domain corpus by two evaluation meas-
ures, i.e., the BLEU score and the NIST score. 
We also showed the possibility of increasing the 
translation quality by using the LM of the domain?s 
target language. However, the gains from using the LM 
in the evaluation scores were not significant. We must 
continue experiments with other corpora and under 
various conditions. In addition, though we?ve implicitly 
assumed a high-quality in-domain corpus, next we?d 
like to investigate using a low-quality corpus.
