Abstract
Micro-blog is a new kind of medium
which is short and informal. While no
segmented corpus of micro-blogs is avail-
able to train Chinese word segmentation
model, existing Chinese word segmenta-
tion tools cannot perform equally well
as in ordinary news texts. In this pa-
per we present an effective yet simple ap-
proach to Chinese word segmentation of
micro-blog. In our approach, we incor-
porate punctuation information of unla-
beled micro-blog data by introducing char-
acters behind or ahead of punctuations,
for they indicate the beginning or end of
words. Meanwhile a self-training frame-
work to incorporate confident instances is
also used, which prove to be helpful. Ex-
periments on micro-blog data show that
our approach improves performance, espe-
cially in OOV-recall.
1 INTRODUCTION
Micro-blog (also known as tweets in English) is
a new kind of broadcast medium in the form of
blogging. A micro-blog differs from a traditional
blog in that it is typically smaller in size. Further-
more, texts in micro-blogs tend to be informal and
new words occur more frequently. These new fea-
tures of micro-blogs make the Chinese Word Seg-
mentation (CWS) models trained on the source do-
main, such as news corpus, fail to perform equally
well when transferred to texts from micro-blogs.
For example, the most widely used Chinese seg-
menter ?ICTCLAS? yields 0.95 f-score in news
corpus, only gets 0.82 f-score on micro-blog data.
The poor segmentation results will hurt subse-
quent analysis on micro-blog text.
?Corresponding author
Manually labeling the texts of micro-blog is
time consuming. Luckily, punctuations provide
useful information because they are used as indi-
cators of the end of previous sentence and the be-
ginning of the next one, which also indicate the
start and the end of a word. These ?natural bound-
aries? appear so frequently in micro-blog texts that
we can easily make good use of them. TABLE 1
shows some statistics of the news corpus vs. the
micro-blogs. Besides, English letters and digits
are also more than those in news corpus. They
all are natural delimiters of Chinese characters and
we treat them just the same as punctuations.
We propose a method to enlarge the training
corpus by using punctuation information. We
build a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework
which can iteratively incorporate newly labeled in-
stances from unlabeled micro-blog data during the
training process. We test our method on micro-
blog texts and experiments show good results.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 1
we introduce the problem. Section 2 gives detailed
description of our approach. We show the experi-
ment and analyze the results in section 3. Section
4 gives the related works and in section 5 we con-
clude the whole work.
2 Our method
2.1 Punctuations
Chinese word segmentation problem might be
treated as a character labeling problem which
gives each character a label indicating its position
in one word. To be simple, one can use label ?B?
to indicate a character is the beginning of a word,
and use ?N? to indicate a character is not the be-
ginning of a word. We also use the 2-tag in our
work. Other tag sets like the ?BIES? tag set are not
suiteable because the puctuation information can-
not decide whether a character after punctuation
should be labeled as ?B? or ?S?(word with Single

character).
Punctuations can serve as implicit labels for the
characters before and after them. The character
right after punctuations must be the first character
of a word, meanwhile the character right before
punctuations must be the last character of a word.
An example is given in TABLE 2.
2.2 Algorithm
Our algorithm ?ADD-N? is shown in TABLE 3.
The initially selected character instances are those
right after punctuations. By definition they are all
labeled with ?B?. In this case, the number of train-
ing instances with label ?B? is increased while the
number with label ?N? remains unchanged. Be-
cause of this, the model trained on this unbal-
anced corpus tends to be biased. This problem can
become even worse when there is inexhaustible
supply of texts from the target domain. We as-
sume that labeled corpus of the source domain can
be treated as a balanced reflection of different la-
bels. Therefore we choose to estimate the bal-
anced point by counting characters labeling ?B?
and ?N? and calculate the ratio which we denote
as ?. We assume the enlarged corpus is also bal-
anced if and only if the ratio of ?B? to ?N? is just
the same to? of the source domain.
Our algorithm uses data from source domain to
make the labels balanced. When enlarging corpus
using characters behind punctuations from texts
in target domain, only characters labeling ?B? are
added. We randomly reuse some characters label-
ing ?N? from labeled data until ratio? is reached.
We do not use characters ahead of punctuations,
because the single-character words ahead of punc-
tuations take the label of ?B? instead of ?N?. In
summary our algorithm tackles the problem by du-
plicating labeled data in source domain. We de-
note our algorithm as ?ADD-N?.
We also use baseline feature templates include
the features described in previous works (Sun and
Xu, 2011; Sun et al, 2012). Our algorithm is not
necessarily limited to a specific tagger. For sim-
plicity and reliability, we use a simple Maximum-
Entropy tagger.
3 Experiment
3.1 Data set
We evaluate our method using the data from
weibo.com, which is the biggest micro-blog ser-
vice in China. We use the API provided by
weibo.com1 to crawl 500,000 micro-blog texts of
weibo.com, which contains 24,243,772 charac-
ters. To keep the experiment tractable, we first ran-
domly choose 50,000 of all the texts as unlabeled
data, which contain 2,420,037 characters. We
manually segment 2038 randomly selected micro-
blogs.We follow the segmentation standard as the
PKU corpus.
In micro-blog texts, the user names and URLs
have fixed format. User names start with ?@?, fol-
lowed by Chinese characters, English letters, num-
bers and ? ?, and terminated when meeting punc-
tuations or blanks. URLs also match fixed pat-
terns, which are shortened using ?http://t.
cn/? plus six random English letters or numbers.
Thus user names and URLs can be pre-processed
separately. We follow this principle in following
experiments.
We use the benchmark datasets provided by the
second International Chinese Word Segmentation
Bakeoff2 as the labeled data. We choose the PKU
data in our experiment because our baseline meth-
ods use the same segmentation standard.
We compare our method with three baseline
methods. The first two are both famous Chinese
word segmentation tools: ICTCLAS3 and Stan-
ford Chinese word segmenter4, which are widely
used in NLP related to word segmentation. Stan-
ford Chinese word segmenter is a CRF-based seg-
mentation tool and its segmentation standard is
chosen as the PKU standard, which is the same
to ours. ICTCLAS, on the other hand, is a HMM-
based Chinese word segmenter. Another baseline
is Li and Sun (2009), which also uses punctua-
tion in their semi-supervised framework. F-score

is used as the accuracy measure. The recall of
out-of-vocabulary is also taken into consideration,
which measures the ability of the model to cor-
rectly segment out of vocabulary words.

Table 4: Segmentation performance with different
methods on the development data.
TABLE 4 summarizes the segmentation results.
In TABLE 4, Li-Sun is the method in Li and
Sun (2009). Maxent only uses the PKU data for
training, with neither punctuation information nor
self-training framework incorporated. The next 4
methods all require a 100 iteration of self-training.
No-punc is the method that only uses self-training
while no punctuation information is added. No-
balance is similar to ADD N. The only difference
between No-balance and ADD-N is that the for-
mer does not balance label ?B? and label ?N?.
The comparison of Maxent and No-punctuation
shows that naively adding confident unlabeled in-
stances does not guarantee to improve perfor-
mance. The writing style and word formation of
the source domain is different from target domain.
When segmenting texts of the target domain using
models trained on source domain, the performance
will be hurt with more false segmented instances
added into the training set.
The comparison of Maxent, No-balance and
ADD-N shows that considering punctuation as
well as self-training does improve performance.
Both the f-score and OOV-recall increase. By
comparing No-balance and ADD-N alone we can
find that we achieve relatively high f-score if we
ignore tag balance issue, while slightly hurt the
OOV-Recall. However, considering it will im-
prove OOV-Recall by about +1.6% and the f-
score +0.2%.
We also experimented on different size of un-
labeled data to evaluate the performance when
adding unlabeled target domain data. TABLE 5
shows different f-scores and OOV-Recalls on dif-
ferent unlabeled data set.
We note that when the number of texts changes
from 0 to 50,000, the f-score and OOV both are
improved. However, when unlabeled data changes
to 200,000, the performance is a bit decreased,
while still better than not using unlabeled data.
This result comes from the fact that the method
?ADD-N? only uses characters behind punctua-

tions from target domain. Taking more texts into
consideration means selecting more characters la-
beling ?N? from source domain to simulate those
in target domain. If too many ?N?s are introduced,
the training data will be biased against the true dis-
tribution of target domain.
3.3 Characters ahead of punctuations
In the ?BN? tagging method mentioned above,
we incorporate characters after punctuations from
texts in micro-blog to enlarge training set.We also
try an opposite approach, ?EN? tag, which uses
?E? to represent ?End of word?, and ?N? to rep-
resent ?Not the end of word?. In this contrasting
method, we only use characters just ahead of punc-
tuations. We find that the two methods show sim-
ilar results. Experiment results with ADD-N are
shown in TABLE 6 .

4 Related Work
Recent studies show that character sequence la-
beling is an effective formulation of Chinese
word segmentation (Low et al, 2005; Zhao et al,
2006a,b; Chen et al, 2006; Xue, 2003). These
supervised methods show good results, however,
are unable to incorporate information from new
domain, where OOV problem is a big challenge
for the research community. On the other hand
unsupervised word segmentation Peng and Schu-
urmans (2001); Goldwater et al (2006); Jin and
Tanaka-Ishii (2006); Feng et al (2004); Maosong
et al (1998) takes advantage of the huge amount
of raw text to solve Chinese word segmentation
problems. However, they usually are less accurate
and more complicated than supervised ones.
Meanwhile semi-supervised methods have been
applied into NLP applications. Bickel et al (2007)
learns a scaling factor from data of source domain
and use the distribution to resemble target do-
main distribution. Wu et al (2009) uses a Domain
adaptive bootstrapping (DAB) framework, which
shows good results on Named Entity Recognition.
Similar semi-supervised applications include Shen
et al (2004); Daume? III and Marcu (2006); Jiang
and Zhai (2007); Weinberger et al (2006). Be-
sides, Sun and Xu (2011) uses a sequence labeling
framework, while unsupervised statistics are used
as discrete features in their model, which prove to
be effective in Chinese word segmentation.
There are previous works using punctuations as
implicit annotations. Riley (1989) uses it in sen-
tence boundary detection. Li and Sun (2009) pro-
posed a compromising solution to by using a clas-
sifier to select the most confident characters. We
do not follow this approach because the initial er-
rors will dramatically harm the performance. In-
stead, we only add the characters after punctua-
tions which are sure to be the beginning of words
(which means labeling ?B?) into our training set.
Sun and Xu (2011) uses punctuation information
as discrete feature in a sequence labeling frame-
work, which shows improvement compared to the
pure sequence labeling approach. Our method
is different from theirs. We use characters after
punctuations directly.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented an effective yet
simple approach to Chinese word segmentation on
micro-blog texts. In our approach, punctuation in-
formation of unlabeled micro-blog data is used,
as well as a self-training framework to incorpo-
rate confident instances. Experiments show that
our approach improves performance, especially in
OOV-recall. Both the punctuation information and
the self-training phase contribute to this improve-
ment.
