Abstract
This paper discusses preliminary work investi-
gating the application of Machine Translation
(MT) metrics toward the evaluation of transla-
tions written by human novice (student) trans-
lators. We describe a study in which we ap-
ply the metric TERp (Translation Edit Rate
Plus) to a corpus of student-written transla-
tions from Spanish to English and compare the
judgments of TERp against assessments pro-
vided by a translation instructor.
1 Introduction
Extensive work in the field of Computational Lin-
guistics has focused on the development of gold-
standard metrics to automatically judge the accuracy
of machine-generated translations. We are exploring
whether these metrics, or a modified version thereof,
may be applied to the translations generated by hu-
man novices.
While Machine Translation (MT) metrics have
been shown to perform poorly when evaluating
human-written translations due to their lack of toler-
ance for the high level of variation in human-written
work, it is our belief that novice student translators
keep much closer to the source text, and therefore
will be easier to assess using automatic metrics.
Initial motivation for this work comes from de-
veloping the King Alfred translation environment
(Michaud, 2008) supporting students of Anglo-
Saxon English translating sentences into Modern
English. Criticisms of the application of compu-
tational tools toward language learning have often
highlighted the reality that the mainstays of modern
language teaching?dialogue and a focus on com-
municative goals over syntactic perfectionism?
parallel the shortcomings of a computational envi-
ronment. While efforts continue to extend the state
of the art toward making the computer a conver-
sational partner, they nevertheless often fall short
of providing the language learner with learning as-
sistance in the task of communicative competence
that can make a real difference within or without
the classroom. The modern learner of ancient or
?dead? languages, however, has fundamentally dif-
ferent needs; the focus is on translation from source
texts into the learner?s L1. An initial goal, therefore,
was to provide the King Alfred system with ability
to automatically judge and respond to student trans-
lations given a single instructor-provided reference.
The potential applications of this work extend be-
yond the learning of dead languages, however; trans-
lation skills in modern languages (until the field of
MT reaches its full potential) are still needed for pro-
viding readers with access to cross-lingual informa-
tion. The ability to assist translation instruction via a
tutoring system outside of the classroom, or to assess
translator skill automatically, is therefore greatly de-
sirable.
The study described in this paper therefore fo-
cuses on a corpus of learner-written translations
from a Spanish-English translation course; in Sec-
tion 6 we discuss how these results may compare
to those using a corpus of translations from Anglo-
Saxon, which is one of our future tasks.

2 Evaluating Student-Written
Translations Using TERp
A primary challenge facing the assessment of trans-
lation fitness is the abstract nature of the definition
of fitness with respect to the translating task. Most
people approach this definition with two major foci:
fluency (is it well-formed?) and fidelity (does it con-
vey original meaning?) (Hovy et al, 2002). There
are also stylistic concerns; translation can be defined
as ?rendering the meaning of a text into another lan-
guage in the way the author intended the text? (New-
mark, 1988)?and intention is difficult to precisely
define. None of these viewpoints dictates that there
exists only one way to write a translation.
We were drawn to the TERp (Translation Edit
Rate Plus) translation metric (Snover et al, 2009)
for our initial study because of its particular ap-
proach toward capturing this multiplicity of correct
translations. Other metrics have addressed this is-
sue; BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), for example, uses
multiple reference translations, in the hopes of cap-
turing diversity through using diverse sources. The
creators of TERp, however, create an alignment be-
tween reference and hypothesis strings in which di-
rect matches are not required; they acknowledge
synonymy by leveraging WordNet synsets (Fell-
baum, 1998; Princeton University, 2010), in addi-
tion to using a stemmer, and a phrase table to handle
probabilistic phrasal substitution. TERp also allows
for words or phrases to be shifted into a different po-
sition, which nicely accounts for flexibility in terms
of prepositional phrase or adverb placement or to
handle modifiers that can take multiple forms.
There has been some dismissal of the appropri-
ateness of MT metrics for Computer-Aided Lan-
guage Learning (CALL) applications (cf. (Mc-
Carthy, 2006)) due to the fact that they often provide
a holistic score comparing the hypothesis translation
to one or more reference translations without identi-
fying the source and nature of the differences. How-
ever, the output of TERp also includes more than a
holistic score; there is complete documentation of
the alignments, with tags identifying the ?edits? re-
quired to line up the hypothesis with the reference,
as seen in Figure 1. This is an excellent resource
from the perspective of translation pedagogy. While
the METEOR system (Agarwal and Lavie, 2008)
also uses WordNet synonymy and a stemmer to sim-
ilar purpose, we believe that TERp comes the clos-
est to embracing the multiplicity of translation paths
while at the same time flagging issues of fundamen-
tal concern in a pedagogical application of MT met-
rics.
3 Related Work
Other environments seeking to support student
translations have addressed the issue of auto-
matically determining translation accuracy. A
English-Chinese translation environment described
by (Wang and Seneff, 2007; Xu and Seneff, 2008)
presents students with L1 sentences to translate into
L2 speech. Because many of its L1 sentences are
automatically generated, there is no possibility of
prestored reference translations, so the system uses
speech recognition to obtain the L2 sentence, and
then parses both the English and Chinese sentences
into a common interlingual representation in order
to compare for accuracy. The authors report a high
level of agreement between the system?s judgments
on translation acceptability compared to that of a
human expert, but unfortunately, the system can-
not give a finer-grained judgment on student perfor-
mance than accept or reject.
Another English-Chinese system is described by
(Shei and Pain, 2002), creators of TMT, the Trans-
lation Method Tutor. In this case, students are trans-
lating from their L2 (English) into their L1 (Chi-
nese) using source sentences from Jane Austen?s
Pride and Prejudice, each selected to practice a par-
ticular linguistic structure. Students? translations
are matched against four possible reference trans-
lations: word-to-word (MT generated), literal (MT-
307
generated and then post-processed to obey word or-
der rules), semantic (professional translations), and
communicative (done by the authors), and the feed-
back provided to the student includes which trans-
lation she matched most closely and a lesson on
how to deal with the structure at hand. Comparisons
between the student translation and the references
look at strict similarity and are heavily influenced
by word selection rather than structure.
The Translator Choice Program (McCarthy, 2006)
focuses on French-English translation for native En-
glish speakers. It presents passages in the L2
(French) and asks students to look at five candidate
English translations written by students in previous
years. Students either pick the best translation or
rank them, and are scored in how similar their judg-
ment is to that of their instructor. This system does
not attempt, therefore, to handle novel translations
performed by the student.
4 A Corpus of Student-Written
Translations
In Spring 2012, we solicited participation from stu-
dents of a Spanish-English translation course. In this
course, students are asked to translate a sequence
of articles in both Spanish and English, typically
alternating the source language. The articles ad-
dress varied topics from financial advice to current
news. Thirteen students (both native English speak-
ers and native Spanish speakers) opted to have their
semester?s work collected as part of our study. Ref-
erence translations were provided for the entire cor-
pus by the instructor of the course.
For our initial study, we have focused on only
the Spanish-to-English translations, as many aspects
of the metric we used focus on comparing an En-
glish hypothesis sentence against an English refer-
ence sentence. This yielded a total of 2,982 sen-
tences. They are described in Table 1.
Table 1: Our Student-Written Translation Corpus.

Native English Speakers 3
Native Spanish Speakers 10

5 Comparing Human Judgments to TERp
Before analyzing the translations with the MT met-
ric, we post-processed the corpus to create an align-
ment between student translations, source sentences,
and the instructor reference. One of the challenges
we faced in this step is that these students, unlike
an MT system, are actively encouraged to recog-
nize the stylistic differences between English and
Spanish native writing in terms of sentence brevity.
The students therefore sometimes create translations
that do not always perfectly match sentence bound-
aries of the source text; in some cases a single
Spanish sentence has been split into multiple En-
glish sentences (following a general principle that
English native speakers typically use more concise
utterances), but sometimes also the opposite occurs,
where two source sentences are combined into one
translated sentence. While most translations (more
than 99%) did obey source sentence boundaries, for
alignment purposes whenever a sentence was split
both target sentences were concatenated into a single
string (including the end-of-sentence punctuation,
which is ignored by TERp)1 for comparison against
the reference. Where the student had merged two
sentences, the clauses were separated at an appro-
priate boundary and treated as separate utterances.
The instructor-provided references obeyed a 1:1 cor-
respondence between source and target sentences.
Our entire corpus has been graded using the
TERp-A variant, with unchanged parameters2. The
TERp system scores sentences on an interval of
[0,100], where a lower score indicates closer agree-
ment to the reference translation, and 100 indicates
no agreement; for the ease of our human grader, we
normalized the TERp scores to invert the scale and
better match a human-intuitive scale of 100 for ex-
cellence and 0 for no agreement.
Figure 2 illustrates for those subjects submitting
more than three assignments to the study the longitu-
dinal progress of the average TERp score (inverted)
across the sentences in each assignment given over
1The insertion of a connector, such as ?and,? to form a uni-
fied sentence could be penalized by TERp, so it was avoided;
the alternative to avoid penalty would be to include whatever
connector the original author used, but this would not be avail-
able during automated analysis later.
2As will be discussed in Section 6, a future goal is to tune
the parameters for performance on this data.

the term. Although there were clearly a couple
of assignments that were very challenging to all of
the students, the trend line shown indicates that the
scores were rising over the course of the semester.
We have also collected instructor-assigned scores
on a portion of our corpus in order to compare them
against these TERp scores. An example of the rubric
used by the instructor as part of her regular grading
practices in the course is shown in Table 2. Each
of these categories receive a score from 0-10 with
10 being excellent, 9 good, 8 satisfactory, and 0-7
deficient.

Conveys original meaning 55%
Written in natural language 20%
Uses appropriate vocabulary 10%
Written in accurate language 15%
Our preliminary study has yielded some interest-
ing results. The Pearson correlation between the
two sets of scores is r=0.232236, which on a [-1,1]
interval indicates weak positive correlation. But if
TERp does not have significant agreement with the
students? instructor, what is the source of the dis-
agreement? One illustration of this disagreement is
the distribution of the grades; Figure 3 shows that
the instructor?s grades are heavily slanted toward the
high end of the scale, with 42% of the sentences
scored receiving a grade of 90 or higher; TERp,
by contrast, gave very few sentences higher normal-
ized accuracy scores. This is most likely due to the
instructor?s heavy emphasis placed on communica-
tive rather than syntactic accuracy, as shown in the
rubric. We are in the process of rescoring the corpus
with a revised rubric that places stronger emphasis
on syntactic accuracy.
Figure 3: TERp score distribution compared against the
human expert.
While TERp has already been evaluated in terms
of its correlation to human judgment, this has not
been done before with learner-written sentences3.
We also performed an analysis of a randomized sam-
ple of individual sentences with a particular focus
on the four edits designed to accommodate diver-
gence but equivalence (or near equivalence): phrase
equivalency, stemming, synonymy, and shifts. Our
pilot study results indicate that TERp?s identified ed-
its have very high precision: 100% for the stemmer,
which is to be expected, but also 92% for appropri-
ate shifts, 89% for synonymy, and 83% for phrase
equivalency. In recall, the edits performed less well;
for example, synonymy achieved a recall of only
65%. This is possibly a limitation of the synset re-
source.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We have seen that TERp?s identification of the
source and nature of divergences between a student
3The word learner here refers to the fact that the writer is a
student of translation, not to whether he or she is writing in an
L2.
309
translation and a teacher?s reference translation is
reliable; it correctly identifies the nature of the di-
vergence from the reference in a high percentage
of cases. This can provide a tutoring environment
with sufficient information to address the transla-
tion?s problems in feedback to the student, and in-
dicates that holistic scores will be much more corre-
lated with human scores that place equal emphasis
on syntactic quality. A future version of the King
Alfred system will use these error identifications to
drive its feedback.
Once the rescoring of the corpus with an empha-
sis on syntactic accuracy is complete, further work
will include tuning the TERp parameters for higher
performance on the student corpus, with the aim of
greatly improving the correlation of the scores.
We are also looking at post-processing TERp?s
scores so that certain divergences are not penalized.
There is a cost associated with the edits that repre-
sent mismatches between the reference and hypoth-
esis texts. While the idea of flexible phrase order,
and the equality of synonym choice or phrase choice
is captured by the metric, the application of such
edits worsens the grade of the translation. We be-
lieve that stemming and substitution, deletion, or
insertion should be penalized, but that synonymy,
phrase matches, and shifts should be free of charge;
those costs will therefore be added back into the fi-
nal score.
As part of our larger investigation, we will con-
tinue to evaluate the applicability of machine trans-
lation metrics in general to the learner translation
problem. The Mult-Eval suite of metrics (Clark et
al., 2011) is a short term target, and iBLEU (Mad-
nani, 2011) may provide useful data for a pedagogi-
cal context.
With a recent addition of 14 more subjects, we
would also like to do an investigation of whether
the performance of an MT metric is affected by
whether the novice translator is translating L1?L2,
or L2?L1. English native speakers are a minority
in our subject pool, but with doubling the size of our
corpus, we may be able to explore this more reliably.
One of our other interests going forward is to ac-
commodate the distinct errors made by a very novice
human translator. One such error is a tendency
to fall prey to false cognates or faux amis?false
friends, words that look similar (like Spanish em-
barazada and English embarrassed) that have sig-
nificantly different meanings (embarazada, for ex-
ample, meaning ?pregnant?). We have a working
hypothesis that student translators are often misled
by these similar-looking words. We are currently
working to automatically extract potential faux amis
from parallel Spanish/English dictionaries with the
hope of augmenting TERp?s ability to align parallel
elements between the student and reference trans-
lation. We are leveraging the spellcheck algorithm
Hunspell to identify the similarly-spelled words.
Finally, it is our intention to do a comparative
study between evaluating learner translations from
modern languages and learner translations from an-
cient languages such as Anglo-Saxon. One chal-
lenge that may arise is that many ancient languages
such as Anglo-Saxon are morphologically rich and
therefore not strict word order languages; the source
text will be fluid with its own order and this may
introduce more diversity than in a modern language
translation even among novice translators.
