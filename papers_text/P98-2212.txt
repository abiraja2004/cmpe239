A method is presented for automatically aug- 
menting the bilingual exicon of an existing Ma- 
chine Translation system, by extracting bilin- 
gual entries from aligned bilingual text. The 
proposed method only relies on the resources 
already available in the MT system itself. It is 
based on the use of bilingual lexical templates 
to match the terminal symbols in the parses of 
the aligned sentences. 
1 In t roduct ion  
A novel approach to automatically building 
bilingual lexicons is presented here. The term 
bilingual exicon denotes a collection of complex 
equivalences as used in Machine Translation 
(MT) transfer lexicons, not just word equiva- 
lences. In addition to words, such lexicons in- 
volve syntactic and semantic descriptions and 
means to perform a correct ransfer between the 
two sides of a bilingual exical entry. 
A symbolic, rule-based approach of the parse- 
parse-match kind is proposed. The core idea 
is to use the resources of bidirectional transfer 
MT systems for this purpose, taking advantage 
of their features to convert hem to a novel use. 
In addition to having them use their bilingual 
lexicons to produce translations, it is proposed 
to have them use translations to produce bilin- 
gual lexicons. Although other uses might be 
conceived, the most appropriate use is to have 
an MT system automatically augment its own 
bilingual exicon from a small initial sample. 
The core of the described approach consists 
of using a set of bilingual lexical templates in 
matching the parses of two aligned sentences 
and in turning the lexical equivalences thus es- 
tablished into new bilingual exical entries. 
2 Theoret i ca l  f ramework  
The basic requirement hat an MT system 
should meet for the present purpose is to be 
bidirectional. Bidirectionality is required in or- 
der to ensure that both source and target gram- 
mars can be used for parsing and that transfer 
can be done in both directions. More precisely, 
what is relevant is that the input and output to 
transfer be the same kind of structure. 
Moreover, the proposed method is most pro- 
ductive with a lexicalist MT system (White- 
lock, 1994). The proposed application is con- 
cerned with producing bilingual lexical knowl- 
edge and this sort of knowledge is the only type 
of bilingual knowledge required by lexicalist sys- 
tems. Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that 
the present approach can be used with a non- 
lexicalist ransfer system, as long as the system 
is bidirectional. In this case, only the lexical 
portion of the bilingual knowledge can be au- 
tomatically produced, assuming that the struc- 
tural transfer portion is already in place. In 
the rest of this paper, a lexicalist MT system 
will be assumed and referred to. For the spe- 
cific implementation described here and all the 
examples, we will refer to an existing lexicalist 
English-Spanish MT system (Popowich et al, 
1997). 
The main feature of a lexicalist MT system is 
that it performs no structural transfer. Transfer 
is a mapping between a bag of lexical items used 
in parsing (the source bag) and a corresponding 
bag of target lexical items (the target bag), to 
be used in generation. The source bag actu- 
ally contains more information than the corre- 
sponding bag of lexical items before parsing. Its 
elements get enriched with additional informa- 
tion instantiated during the parsing process. In- 
formation of fundamental importance included 
therein is a system of indices that express de- 
1299 
pendencies among lexical items. Such depen- 
dencies are transferred to the target bag and 
used to constrain generation. The task of gen- 
eration is to find an order in which the lexical 
items can be successfully parsed. 
3 B i l ingua l  templates  
A bilingual template is a bilingual entry in which 
words are left unspecified. E.g.: 
(1) _ :: (L ,?count_noun(A))  ~-~ 
_ :: (R, ?noun(A) ) 
\ \t rans_noun (L, R). 
Here, a '" :' operator connects a word (a vari- 
able, in a template) to a description, %-~' con- 
nects the left and right sides of the entry, ' \V 
introduces a transfer macro, which takes two 
descriptions as arguments and performs some 
additional transfer (Turcato et al, 1997). De- 
scriptions are mainly expressed by macros, in- 
troduced by a '?' operator. The macro argu- 
ments are indices, as used in lexicalist transfer. 
Templates have been widely used in MT 
(Buschbeck-Wolf and Dorna, 1997), particu- 
larly in the Example-Based Machine Transla- 
tion (EBMT) framework (Kaji et al (i992), 
Giivenir and Tun~ (1996)). However, in 
EBMT, templates are most often used to model 
sentence-level correspondences, rather then lex- 
ical equivalences. Consequently, in EBMT the 
relation between lexical equivalences and tem- 
plates is the reverse of what is being proposed 
here. In EBMT, lexical equivalences are as- 
sumed and (sentential) templates are inferred 
from them. In the present framework, sentential 
correspondences (in the form of possible combi- 
nations of lexical templates) are assumed and 
lexical equivalences are inferred from them. 
In a lexicalist approach, the notion of bilin- 
gual lexical entry, and thus that of bilingual 
template, must be intended broadly. Multiword 
entries can exist. They can express dependen- 
cies among lexical items, thus being suitable for 
expressing phrasal equivalences. In brief, bilin- 
gual lexical entries can exhaustively cover all the 
bilingual information eeded in transfer. 
In a lexicalist MT system, transfer is accom- 
plished by finding a bag of bilingual entries par- 
titioning the source bag. The source side of each 
entry (in the rest of this paper: the left hand 
side) corresponds to a cell of the partition. The 
union of the target sides of the entries consti- 
tutes the target bag. E.g.: 
(2) a. 
b. 
C. 
Source bag: 
{ Sw,::Sdl, Sw2::Sd2, Sw3::Sd3} 
Bilingual entries: 
{SWl::Sdl ~5 Sw3::Sd3 ~-+ 
Twl :: Tdl & Tw2:: Td2, 
Sw2::Sd2 
Tw3:: Td3 ~ Tw4:: Td4} 
Target bag: 
{ Twl::Tdl, Tw2::Td2, Tw3::Td3, 
Tw4::Td4} 
where each Sw{::Sdi and Twi::Tdi are, respec- 
tively, a source and target < Word, Description> 
pair. In addition, the bilingual entries must sat- 
isfy the constraints expressed by indices in the 
source and target bags. The same information 
can be used to find (2b), given (2a) and (2c). 
Any bilingual exicon is partitioned by a set of 
templates. The entries in each equivalence class 
only differ by their words. A bilingual lexical en- 
try can thus be viewed as a triple <Sw, Tw, T>, 
where Sw is a list of source words, Tw a list of 
target words, and T a template. A set of such 
bilingual templates can be intuitively regarded 
as a 'transfer grammar'. A grammar defines all 
the possible sequences of pre-terminal symbols, 
i.e. all the possible types of sentences. Anal- 
ogously, a set of bilingual templates defines all 
the possible translational equivalences between 
bags of pre-terminal symbols, i.e. all the possi- 
ble equivalences between types of sentences. 
Using this intuition, the possibility is ex- 
plored of analyzing a pair of such bags by means 
of a database of bilingual templates, to find a 
bag of templates that correctly accounts for the 
translational equivalence of the two bags, with- 
out resorting to any information about words. 
In the example (2), the following bag of tem- 
plates would be the requested solution: 
(3) {-::Sdl &: -::Sd3 ~ -::Tdl & -::Td2, 
-::Sd2 ~ -:: Td3 ~ _:: Td4} 
Equivalences between (bags of) words are au- 
tomatically obtained as a result of the process, 
whereas in translating they are assumed and 
used to select the appropriate bilingual entries.

Table 1: Incremental template coverage 
The whole idea is based on the assumption 
that a lexical item's description and the con- 
straints on its indices are sufficient in most cases 
to uniquely identify a lexical item in a parse out- 
put bag. Although exceptions could be found 
(most notably, two modifiers of the same cate- 
gory modifying the same head), the idea is vi- 
able enough to be worth exploring. 
The impression might arise that it is difficult 
and impractical to have a set of templates avail- 
able in advance. However, there is empirical ev- 
idence to the contrary. A count on the MT sys- 
tem used here showed that a restricted number 
of templates covers a large portion of a bilingual 
lexicon. Table 1 shows the incremental cover- 
age. Although completeness is hard to obtain, 
a satisfactory coverage can be achieved with a 
relatively small number of templates. 
In the implementation described here, a set of 
templates was extracted from the MT bilingual 
lexicon and used to bootstrap further lexical 
development. The whole lexical development 
can be seen as an interactive process involv- 
ing a bilingual exicon and a template database. 
Templates are initially derived from the lexi- 
con, new entries are successively created using 
the templates. Iteratively, new entries can be 
manually coded when the automatic procedure 
is lacking appropriate templates and new tem- 
plates extracted from the manually coded en- 
tries can be added to the template database. 
4 The  a lgor i thm 
In this section the algorithm for creating bilin- 
gual lexical entries is described, along with a 
sample run. The procedure was implemented 
in Prolog, as was the MT system at hand. Ba- 
sically, a set of lexical entries is obtained from a 
pair of sentences by first parsing the source and 
target sentences. The source bag is then trans- 
ferred using templates as transfer rules (plus en- 
tries for closed-class words and possibly a pre- 
existing bilingual lexicon). The transfer out- 
put bag is then unified with the target sentence 
parse output bag. If the unification succeeds, 
the relevant information (bilingual templates 
and associated words) is retrieved to build up 
the new bilingual entries. Otherwise, the sys- 
tem backtracks into new parses and transfers. 
The main predicate make_entr ies/3 matches 
a source and a target sentence to produce a set 
of bilingual entries: 
make_entries(Source,Target,Entries):- 
parse_source(Source,Derivl), 
parse_target(Target,Deriv2), 
transfer(Derivl,Deriv3), 
get_bag(Deriv2,Bag2), 
get_bag(Deriv3,Bag3), 
match_bags(Bag2,Bag3,Bag4), 
get_bag(Derivl,Bagl), 
make_be_info(Bagl,Bag4,Deriv3,Be), 
be_info_to_entries(Be,Entries). 
Each Derivn variable points to a buffer where 
all the information about a specific derivation 
(parse or transfer) is stored and each Bagn vari- 
able refers to a bag of lexical items. Each step 
will be discussed in detail in the rest of the sec- 
tion. A sample run will be shown for the fol- 
lowing English-Spanish pair of sentences: 
(4) a. the fat man kicked out the black 
dog. 
b. el hombre gordo ech5 el perro 
negro. 
In the sample session o bilingual exicon was 
used for content words. Only a bilingual lexi- 
con for closed class words and a set of bilingual 
templates were used. Therefore, new bilingual 
entries were obtained for all the content words 
(or phrases) in the sentences. 
4.1 Source sentence parse 
The parse of the source sentence is performed 
by parse_source/2. The parse tree is shown in 
Fig. 1. Since only lexical items are relevant for 
the present purposes, only pre-terminal nodes 
in the tree are labeled.

Figure 2: Source sentence parse output bag. 
Fig. 2 shows, in succint form, the relevant 
information from the source bag, i.e. the bag 
resulting from parsing the source sentence. All 
the syntactic and semantic information has been 
omitted and replaced by a category label. What 
is relevant here is the way the indices are set, as 
a result of parsing. The words { the , fa t ,man} 
are tied together and so are {k ick ,out}  and 
{the ,b lack ,dog}.  Moreover, the indices of 
'k ick '  show that its second index is tied to its 
subject, { the , fa t  ,man}, and its third index is 
tied to its object, { the ,b lack ,dog}.  
4.2 Target  sentence  parse  
The parse of the target sentence is performed 
by parse_ target /2 .  Fig. 3 and 4 show, 
respectively, the resulting tree and bag. In 
an analogous manner to what is seen in 
the source sentence, {e l ,hombre,gordo)  and 
{el  ,per ro  ,negro} are, respectively, the sub- 
ject and the object of 'echS'. 
4.3 T rans fer  
The result of parsing the source sentence is used 
by t rans fer /2  to create a translationally equiv- 
alent target bag. Fig. 5 shows the result. Trans- 
fer is performed by consulting a bilingual lexi- 
con, which, in the present case, contained en-

tries for closed class words (e.g. an entry map- 
ping ' the'  to 'e l ' )  and templates for content 
words. The templates relevant o our example 
are the following:

'word(adj/adj,1)' ::?adj(A).

'word(cn/n,l)' ::(K,?noun(A))

6-7 word(adj/adj,l) adj \[I\] 
7-8 word(cn/n, I) n \[I\] 
Figure 5: Transfer output bag.

Bilingual templates are simply bilingual en- 
tries with words replaced by variables. Actually, 
on the target side, words are replaced by labels 
of the form word(T i ,Pos i t ion) ,  where Ti is a 
template identifier and Pos i t ion  identifies the 
position of the item in the right hand side of the 
template. Thus, a label word(ad j /ad j ,  1) iden- 
tifies the first word on the right hand side of the 
template that maps an adjective to an adjective. 
Such labels are just implementational technical- 
ities that facilitate the retrieval of the relevant 
information when a lexical entry is built up from 
a template, but they have no role in the match- 
ing procedure. For the present purposes they 
can entirely be regarded as anonymous variables 
that can unify with anything, exactly like their 
source counterparts. 
After transfer, the instances of the templates 
used in the process are coindexed in some way, 
by virtue of their unification with the source bag 
items. This is analogous to what happens with 
bilingual entries in the translation process. 
4.4 Target  bag match ing  
The predicate ge'c_bag/2 retrieves a bag of lex- 
ical items associated with a derivation. There- 
fore, Bag2 and Bag3 will contain the bags of 
lexical items resulting, respectively, from pars- 
ing the target sentence and from transfer. 
The crucial step is the matching between the 
transfer output bag and the target sentence 
parse output bag. The predicate match_bags/3 
tries to unify the two bags (returning the result 
in Bag4). A successful unification entails that 
the parse and transfer of the source sentence 
are consistent with the parse of the target sen- 
tence. In other words, the bilingual rules used 
in transfer correctly map source lexical items 
into target lexical items. Therefore, the lexi- 
cal equivalences newly established through this 
process can be asserted as new bilingual entries. 
In the matching process, the order in which 
the elements are listed in the figures is irrele- 
vant, since the objects at hand are bags, i.e. 
unordered collections. A successful match only 
requires the existence of a one-to-one mapping 
between the two bags, such that: 
(i) the respective descriptions, here repre- 
sented by category labels, are unifiable; 
(ii) a further one-to-one mapping between the 
indices in the two bags is induced. 
The following mapping between the transfer 
output bag (Fig. 5) and the target sentence 
parse output bag (Fig. 4) will therefore succeed: 
{<2-I,I>,<3-2,3>,<4-3,2>,<i-4,4>, 
<5-6,5>,<6-7,7>,<7-8,6>} 
In fact, in addition to correctly unifying the 
descriptions, it induces the following one-to-one 
mapping between the two sets of indices: 
{<A,O>,<B, l>,<I ,13>} 
4.5 Bilingual entries creation 
The rest of the procedure builds up lexical en- 
tries for the newly discovered equivalences and 
is implementation dependent. First, the source 
bag is retrieved in Bag1. Then, make_be_info/4 
links together information from the source bag, 
the target bag (actually, its unification with 
the target sentence parse bag) and the trans- 
fer derivation, to construct a list of terms (the 
variable Be) containing the information to cre- 
ate an entry. Each such term has the form 
be(Sw,Tw,Ti),  where Sw is a list of source 
words, Tw is a list of target words and Ti is 
a template identifier. In our example, the fol- 
lowing be/3 terms are created: 
(6) a. be( \[fat\] , \[gordo\] ,adj/adj) 
b. be ( \[man\] , \[hombre\] , cn/n) 
c. be ( \[kick, out\] , \[echar\] , tv+adv/tv) 
d. be ( \[black\] , \[negro\] , adj/adj ) 
e. be ( \[dog\] , \[perro\] , cn/n) 
Each be/3 term 
into a bilingual entry 
be_info_to_entries/2. 
gual entries are created: 
(7) a. fa t  : :@adj (A) 
is finally turned 
by the predicate 
The following bilin- 
~-~ gordo : :?adj (A). 
b. man ::(D,?count_noun(C)) 
~-~ hombre ::(B,@noun(C)) 
\\trans_noun(D,B). 
C. kick ::(l ,@trans_verb(F,G,H)) 
out ::?advparticle(F) 
+-+ 
echar ::(E,@verb_acc(F,G,H)) 
\\trans_verb(I,E). 
1303 
d. b lack : :~ad j ( J )  
negro : :?ad j ( J ) .  
e. dog ::(M,?count_noun(L)) 
+~ hombre ::(K,?noun(L)) 
\\trans_noun(M,K). 
If a pre-existing bilingual lexicon is in use, 
bilingual entries are prioritized over bilingual 
templates. Consequently, only new entries are 
created, the others being retrieved from the ex- 
isting bilingual lexicon. Incidentally, it should 
be noted that a new entry is an entry which 
differs from any existing entry on either side. 
Therefore, different entries are created for dif- 
ferent senses of the same word, as long as the 
different senses have different ranslations. 
5 Shor tcomings  and  fu ture  work  
In matching a pair of bags, two kinds of ambigu- 
ity could lead to multiple results, some of which 
are incorrect. Firstly, as already mentioned, a 
bag could contain two lexical items with unifi- 
able descriptions (e.g. two adjectives modify- 
ing the same noun), possibly causing an incor- 
rect match. Secondly, as the bilingual template 
database grows, the chance of overlaps between 
templates also grows. Two different emplates 
or combinations of templates might cover the 
same input and output. A case in point is that 
of a phrasal verb or an idiom covered by both a 
single multi-word template and a compositional 
combination of simpler templates. 
As both potential sources of error can be au- 
tomatically detected, a first step in tackling the 
problem would be to block the automatic gener- 
ation of the entries involved when a problematic 
case occurs, or to have a user select the correct 
candidate. In this way the correctness of the 
output is guaranteed. The possible cost is a 
lack of completeness, when no user intervention 
is foreseen. 
Furthermore, techniques for the automatic 
resolution of template overlaps are under inves- 
tigation. Such techniques assume the presence 
of a bilingual lexicon. The information con- 
tained therein is used to assign preferences to 
competing candidate ntries, in two ways. 
Firstly, templates are probabilistically 
ranked, using the existing bilingual lexicon 
to estimate probabilities. When the choice 
is between single entries, the ranking can be 
performed by counting the frequency of each 
competing template in the lexicon. The entry 
with the most frequent emplate is chosen. 
Secondly, heuristics are used to assign pref- 
erences, based on the presence of pre-existing 
entries related in some way to the candidate 
entries. This technique is suited for resolv- 
ing ambiguities where multiple entries are in- 
volved. For instance, given the equivalence 
between 'k i ck  the  bucket '  and 'es t i ra r  la  
pata ' ,  and the competing candidates 
(8) a. {kick ~ bucket  ~ es t i ra r  &pata)  
b. {kick ~-+ es t i ra r ,  bucket  ~ pata} 
the presence of an entry 'bucket ~-* ba lde '  in 
the bilingual exicon might be a clue for prefer- 
ring the idiomatic interpretation. Conversely, if
the hypothetical entry 'bucket ~ pata '  were 
already in the lexicon, the compositional inter- 
pretation might be preferred. 
Finally, efficiency is also dependant on the re- 
strictiveness of grammars. The more grammars 
overgenerate, the more the combinatoric inde- 
terminacy in the matching process increases. 
However, overgeneration is as much a problem 
for translation as for bilingual generation. In 
other words, no additional requirement is placed 
on the MT system which is not independently 
motivated by translation alone. 
6 Conc lus ion  
The parse-parse-match approach to automati- 
cally building bilingual lexicons in not novel. 
Proposals have been put forward, e.g., by Sadler 
and Vendelmans (1990) and Kaji eta/ .  (1992). 
Wu (1995) points out some possible difficul- 
ties of the parse-parse-match approach. Among 
them, the facts that "appropriate, robust, 
monolingual grammars may not be available" 
and "the grammars may be incompatible across 
languages" (Wu, 1995, 355). More generally, 
in bilingual exicon development there is a ten- 
dency to minimize the need for linguistic re- 
sources specifically developed for the purpose. 
In this view, several proposals tend to use statis- 
tical, knowledge-free methods, possibly in com- 
bination with the use of existing Machine Read- 
able Dictionaries (see, e.g., Klavans and Tzouk- 
ermann (1995), which also contains a survey of 
related proposals, pages 195-196). 
1304 
The present proposal tackles the problem 
from a different and novel perspective. The ac- 
knowledgment that MT is the main application 
domain to which bilingual resources are relevant 
is taken as a starting point. The existence of an 
MT system, for which the bilingual lexicon is 
intended, is explicitly assumed. The potential 
problems due to the need for linguistic resources 
are by-passed by having the necessary resources 
available in the MT system. Rather than doing 
away with linguistic knowledge, the pre-existing 
resources of the pursued application are utilized. 
An approach like the present can be most ef- 
fectively adopted to develop tools allowing MT 
systems to automatically build their own bilin- 
gual lexicons. A tool of this sort would use 
no extra resources in addition to those already 
available in the MT system itself. Such a tool 
would take a small sample of a bilingual exicon 
and use it to bootstrap the automatic devel- 
opment of a large lexicon. It is worth noting 
that the bilingual pairs thus produced would be 
complete bilingual entries that could be directly 
incorporated in the MT system, with no post- 
editing or addition of information. 
The only requirement placed by the present 
approach on MT systems is that they be bi- 
directional. Therefore, although aimed at the 
development of specific applications for specific 
MT systems, the approach is general enough to 
apply to a wide range of MT systems.

Resumo* 
Ni prezentas metodon por afitomate krei dul- 
ingvajn leksikojn por perkomputila tradukado 
el dulingvaj tekstoj. La kerna ideo estas ke la 
rimedoj de dudirektaj, transiraj traduksistemoj 
ebligas ne nur uzi dulingvajn leksikajn ekviva- 
lentojn por starigi dulingvajn frazajn ekvivalen- 
tojn~ sed ankafi, inverse, uzi frazajn ekvivalen- 
tojn pot starigi leksikajn ekvivalentojn. La plej 
tafiga apliko de tia ideo estas la evoluigo de 
iloj per kiuj komputilaj traduksistemoj afito- 
mate pligrandigu sian dulingvan leksikon. La 
kerno de tia metodo estas la uzo de dulingvaj 
leksikaj ~ablonoj por kongruigi la analizojn de 
intertradukeblaj frazoj. La leksikajn ekvivalen- 
tojn tiel starigitajn oni aldonas al la dulingva 
leksiko kiel pliajn dul\]ngvajn leksikerojn. 
Tia metodo postulas ke dudirektaj traduk- 
sistemoj estu uzataj. Necesas ke ambafi gra- 
matikoj, kaj la fonta kaj la cela, estu uzeblaj 
por ambafi procezoj, kaj analizado kaj gener- 
ado. Krome, necesas ke la enigo kaj la el\]go de 
la transirprocezo estu samspecaj reprezentajoj. 
Tia metodo estas plej produktiva ~e leksikismaj 
traduksistemoj (Whitelock, 1994), sed $i estas 
same apl\]kebla al dudirektaj neleksikismaj sis- 
temoj. Ni tamen pritraktos nur unuaspecajn 
sistemojn. La plej grava trajto de leksikismaj 
sistemoj estas ke ili ne uzas strukturan trans- 
iron. En tiaj sistemoj, transiro estas jeto de 
fonta plur'aro de leksikaj unuoj al samspeca cela 
plur'aro. La jeto estas difinita per dulingva lek- 
siko, kies leksikeroj povas esti ankafi plurvortaj. 
Semantikajn dependojn inter fontleksikaj unuoj 
oni reprezentas per komunaj indicoj, kiuj estas 
transigataj l korespondaj celleksikaj unuoj. La 
tasko de generado estas ordigi la celleksikajn un- 
uojn en gramatikan celfrazon plenumantan la
transigitajn semantikajn dependojn. 
Dulingvaj ~ablonoj estas dulingvaj leksikeroj 
en kiuj variabloj anstatafias vortojn. Ciu ajn 
dulingva leksiko estas partigata per dulingva 
~ablonaro. Ciuj eroj en sama ekvivalentklaso 
de la partigo diferencas nut pro siaj vortoj. 
Tial oni povas rigardi dulingvan leksikeron kiel 
triopon konsistigatan el fonta vortlisto, cela 
vortlisto kaj ~ablono. Dulingva ~ablonaro es- 
tas rigardebla kiel 'transira gramatiko' difinanta 
~iujn eblajn tradukajn ekvivalentojn. Lafi tia 
intuicio, ni esploras la eblecon analizi paron de 
?La aittoro dankas Brian Kaneen pro lingva konsilo. 
fonta kaj cela plur'aroj per datumbazo de dul- 
ingvaj ~ablonoj, celante trovi ~ablonplur'aron 
kiu korekte reprezentu tradukajn ekvivalentojn 
inter la du plur'aroj, sen uzi informon pri vortoj. 
Ekvivalentoj inter vortoj afitomate rezultas el la 
procezo. Atingi necesan ~ablonaron portia celo 
ne estas malfacila tasko. Nia leksikisma traduk- 
sistemo empirie evidentigas ke malgranda nom- 
bro de ~ablonoj kovras grandan patton de la dul- 
ingva leksiko. En nia realiga\]o, ~ablonaro estis 
ekstraktita el la dulingva leksiko de la traduk- 
sistemo kaj poste uzita por ekfunkciigi plian lek- 
sikan evoluigon. La tutan evoluigon de dulingva 
leksiko oni povas rigardi kiel interagan procezon 
lafi tiaspeca modelo. 
La algoritmo por krej novajn dulingvajn lek- 
sikerojn konsistas el kvin pa~oj: (i-ii) Fonta 
kaj cela frazoj estas analizataj. Fontanal- 
iza kaj celanaliza plur'aroj rezultas el la pro- 
cezo; (iii) Transiro el la fontanaliza plur'aro es- 
tas plenumata, uzante dul\]ngvan leksikon por 
fermklasaj vortoj kaj dulingvan ~ablonaron pot 
malfermklasaj vortoj. La rezulto estas transira 
celplur'aro; (iv) La transira celplur'aro kaj la 
celanal\]za plur'aro estas kongruigataj. Sukcesa 
unuigo sekvigas ke la dullngvaj eroj uzitaj en 
la transiro korekte jetas la fontan frazon al la 
cela frazo. Sekve, la dullngvajn ekvivalentojn, 
rezultantajn el ekzempligo de ~ablonoj, oni ra- 
jtas aserti kiel novajn dulingvajn leksikerojn; 
(v) Novaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas kunmetataj 
el triopoj de fontaj vortlistoj, celaj vortl\]stoj 
kaj dulingvaj ~ablonoj. Se dul\]ngva leksiko 
estas uzata ankal\] pot malfermklasaj vortoj, 
disponeblaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas uzataj 
anstatafi ~ablonoj, kiam eble. Tiamaniere, nur 
mankantaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas kreataj. 
La algoritmo povus erari kiam du unuoj en 
la sama plur'aro havas unuigeblajn priskribojn, 
tial ebligante malkorektan kongruon. Krome, ju 
pli ~ablonaro pligrandi~as, des pli pligrandiSas 
ambigueco en kongruigo, pro interkovri$o de 
~ablonoj. Ambafispecaj ambigua\]oj tamen es- 
tas afitomate rimarkeblaj. Krome, probablis- 
maj kaj hefiristikaj teknikoj por ataki la duan 
problemon estas eksplorataj. 
Per la montrita metodo, komputilaj traduk- 
sistemoj eblas ekfunkciigi afitomatan evoluigon 
de dulingvaj leksikoj per malgranda komenca 
leksiko, sen necesi uzi pliajn rimedojn krom tiuj 
jam disponeblaj en la sistemo mem.
