Abstract
We demonstrate a novel, robust vision-to-
language generation system called Midge.
Midge is a prototype system that connects
computer vision to syntactic structures with
semantic constraints, allowing for the auto-
matic generation of detailed image descrip-
tions. We explain how to connect vision de-
tections to trees in Penn Treebank syntax,
which provides the scaffolding necessary to
further refine data-driven statistical generation
approaches for a variety of end goals.
1 Introduction
There has been a growing interest in tackling the
problem of how to describe an image using com-
puter vision detections. This problem is difficult in
part because computer vision detections are often
wrong: State-of-the-art vision technology predicts
things that are not there, and misses things that are
obvious to a human observer. This problem is also
difficult because it is not clear what kind of language
should be generated ? the language that makes up a
?description? can take many forms.
At the bare minimum, an automatic vision-to-
language system, given an image with a single de-
tection of, for example, a dog, should be able to gen-
erate a dog, and a longer phrase if requested. To be
useful in real-world applications, it should be able to
create basic descriptions that are as true as possible
to the image, as well as descriptions that guess prob-
able information based on language analysis alone.
To our knowledge, no current system provides this
functionality. Midge is built based on these goals.
Our approach converts object detections to de-
scriptive sentences using a tree-generating deriva-
tion process that fleshes out lexicalized syntactic
? Thanks to the CLSP 2011 summer workshop
at Johns Hopkins for making this system possible.

structure around object nouns. Likely subtrees are
learned from a cleaned version of the Flickr dataset
(Ordonez et al, 2011) parsed using the Berkeley
parser. The final structures generated by the system
are present-tense declarative sentences in Penn Tree-
bank syntax.
With this in place, the system can generate a dog,
a black dog sleeping, a furry black dog sleeping by a
cat, etc., while also suggesting further detectors for
the vision system to run. Approaching the problem
in this way, Midge provides a starting point for gen-
eration to meet different goals: from automatically
creating stories or summaries based on visual data,
to suggesting phrases that a speech-impaired AAC
user can select to assist in conversation. There is
still much work to be done, but we believe that the
basic architecture used by this system is a solid start-
ing point for generating a wide variety of descriptive
content, and makes clear some of the issues a vision-
to-language system must handle in order to generate
natural-sounding descriptions.
2 Background
Previous work on generating image descriptions can
be characterized as prioritizing among several goals:
? Creating language that is poetic or metaphori-
cal (Li et al, 2011)
? Creating automatic captions with syntactic
variation based on semantic visual information
(Farhadi et al, 2010)
? Creating language describing the scene in a ba-
sic template-driven way, utilizing attribute de-
tections (Kulkarni et al, 2011) or likely verbs
from a language model (Yang et al, 2011)
To meet one goal, other goals are often compro-
mised. Yang et al (2011) fill in likely verbs to form
complete sentences, but limit the generated struc-
tures to a simple template, without capturing natu-
ral variation in sentence length or surface structure.
131
Li et al (2011) aim at more metaphorical and var-
ied language, but the generated structures are often
syntactically and semantically ill-formed. Farhadi et
al. (2010) generate natural, varied, descriptive lan-
guage, but this is created by copying captions di-
rectly from similar images, resulting in captions that
are often not true to the actual query image content.
Midge builds on ideas from these systems, ad-
ditionally mapping the structures underlying vision
detections to syntactic structures and data-driven
distributional information underlying natural lan-
guage descriptions. With this in place, the door is
opened for language and vision to communicate at
a deep syntactic-semantic level. The language com-
ponents of the system can filter and expand on given
visual information, and can also call back to the vi-
sual system itself, specifying further detectors to run
(or train) based on semantically related or expected
information. We hope that this system not only ad-
vances work in generating visual descriptions, but
work in training visual detectors as well.
3 Vision to Language Issues
The process of developing Midge brought to light
several key issues that any vision-to-language sys-
tem aiming to generate descriptive, varied, human-
like language must handle:
Descriptiveness: Should the system include infor-
mation about everything there is evidence for, limit
that information, or add to it?
World knowledge: What sorts of things in an image
are remarkable, and should be mentioned, and which
may go without saying?
Object grouping: Which objects should be men-
tioned together? How do people divide objects
among sentences when they describe an image?
Which detections should not be mentioned?
Noun ordering: In what order should the objects be
named?
Reference plurals and sets: How should sets of
objects be described as a whole? Should the exact
number be included (four chairs), a vague term (a
few chairs) or a general plural form (chairs)?
Modifier ordering: How should the different modi-
fiers common to descriptions be ordered to make the
utterances sound fluent?
Determiner selection: When should objects be
treated as given (the sky), new (a boy), mass (grass),
or count (a blade)?
Verb selection: Given that action/pose detection in
computer vision does not function reliably, should
verbs be hallucinated from a language model alone?
Should they be left out?
Preposition selection: How should spatial relations
between objects be analyzed, and how does this
translate to language describing the scene layout?
Surface realization: What final lexicalization deci-
sions need to be made to realize the generated strings
within the output language?
Final string selection: Given a set of possible out-
puts, how is the final output string decided?
Nonsense detections: How should the system han-
dle computer vision detections that are often wrong?
Many of these issues are well-suited to statisti-
cal NLP techniques, and some (modifier ordering,
final string selection) have already been addressed in
the NLP community. Where appropriate, Midge in-
corporates this technology alongside novel solutions
to issues that have not yet been heavily researched
(determiner selection, nominal ordering). We hope
to further refine Midge?s solutions as technology in
these areas advances.
Separating Midge?s architecture into components
that handle each of these issues separately means
that the system is flexible to change the kind of lan-
guage it generates depending on the goals of the
end user. The system offers general solutions to
the issues listed above, and can have many of its
goals changed if specified at run-time, resulting in
different kinds of generated utterances. Midge can
successfully create natural, varied descriptions that
add descriptive content based on language modeling
alone; it can also generate descriptions that are more
limited, but as true as possible to the image.

Figure 1: Computer Vision Out / Midge In (Excerpt)
The input to Midge is the output of vision detec-
tions, with detectors run for objects and attributes
within each object?s bounding box. In this demon-
stration, we incorporate the Kulkarni et al (2011)
vision detections. This provides objects/stuff and as-
sociated attributes, bounding boxes, and spatial rela-
tions between object pairs derived from the bound-
132
ing boxes. Object detections are based on Felzen-
szwalb?s multi-scale deformable parts models, and
stuff detections are based on linear SVMs for low
level region features.
Language generation in Midge is driven by a lex-
icalized derivation process that uses likely syntac-
tic and distributional information for object nouns
to create present-tense declarative sentences. Object
detections form the basis of the computer vision de-
tections, and these in turn are linked to nouns that
form the basis of the generated output string.
The syntactic trees used to collect and generate
likely subtrees for object nouns is outlined in Figure
2. Each anchor noun selects for a set of likely ad-
jectives a, determiners d, prepositions p and present
tense verbs v.

5 Architecture
Midge can be explained at a high level as a pipelined
system incorporating the following steps:
Step 1: Run detectors for objects, stuff, action/pose
and attributes; pass as <detection, score> pairs to
Midge. Vision output/NLG input is displayed in Fig-
ure 1 and in the system demo.
Step 2: Group objects together that will be men-
tioned together.
Step 3: Order objects within each group ? this au-
tomatically sets the subject and objects of the sen-
tence. Midge currently order nouns based on Word-
Net hypernyms.
Step 4: Create all tree structures that can be gen-
erated from the object noun node. (See Figure 2).
Noun anchors select for adjectives (JJ), determin-
ers (DT), prepositions (IN) and if specified, verbs
(VBG, VBN, or VBZ).
Step 5: Limit adjectives (JJ) to the set that are not
mutually exclusive ? different values for the same at-
tribute class. REG comes into play at this step.
Step 6: Create all trees that combine following the
given trees until all object nouns in a group are un-
der one node (either NP or S).
Step 7: Order selected adjectives. We use the top-
scoring ngram model from (Mitchell et al, 2011).
Step 8: Choose final tree from set of generated trees.
Users can select a longest-string or cross entropy
calculation.
