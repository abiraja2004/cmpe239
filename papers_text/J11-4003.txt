Levenshtein Distances Fail to Identify
Language Relationships Accurately
Simon J. Greenhill?

The Levenshtein distance is a simple distance metric derived from the number of edit operations
needed to transform one string into another. This metric has received recent attention as a
means of automatically classifying languages into genealogical subgroups. In this article I test
the performance of the Levenshtein distance for classifying languages by subsampling three
language subsets from a large database of Austronesian languages. Comparing the classifica-
tion proposed by the Levenshtein distance to that of the comparative method shows that the
Levenshtein classification is correct only 40% of the time. Standardizing the orthography
increases the performance, but only to a maximum of 65% accuracy within language subgroups.
The accuracy of the Levenshtein classification decreases rapidly with phylogenetic distance,
failing to discriminate homology and chance similarity across distantly related languages. This
poor performance suggests the need for more linguistically nuanced methods for automated
language classification tasks.
1. Introduction
There are around 7,000 languages spoken in the world today (Lewis 2009) that trace
thousands of years of human cultural and linguistic evolution. Historical linguistics
discovers the relationships between these languages using the comparative method
to identify systematic sound correspondences between words in different languages.
These correspondences distinguish the words that have descended from a common
ancestor of the languages (i.e., are ?cognate?), and are representative of the phonological
or morphological innovations in the shared history of those languages (Durie and
Ross 1996). Take, for example, the following words meaning ?three?: Javanese telu,
Mussau tolu, and Tongan tolu. One could therefore postulate that the two Oceanic
languages, Mussau and Tongan, are more closely related to each other than to Javanese
(in schematic form: Mussau,Tongan|Javanese) following a merger of Proto-Malayo-
Polynesian *e/-aw into Proto-Oceanic *o (Blust 2009).
Correctly identifying the relationships between these languages is not an exercise
in mere phylogenetic classification but a tool for investigating human prehistory. As an
example, linguists have used the comparative method to trace the spread of the 1,200 or
so Austronesian languages across the Pacific back to Taiwan (Blust 1999; Pawley 2002).

applied to this lexical cognate data. For example, we tested different scenarios of Pacific
settlement and found compelling support for an origin of the Austronesian language
family in Taiwan around 5,200 years before present (Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill
2009). This combination of computational phylogenetic methods and linguistic data
promises to be a powerful way of exploring human prehistory and linguistic and
cultural evolution (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008; Currie et al 2010; Gray, Bryant, and
Greenhill 2010).
Using the comparative method to identify phylogeny requires a lot of lexical data,
detailed knowledge about phonology (in general, and in the languages in question),
and a lot of time (Durie and Ross 1996), however. It has recently been suggested that the
Levenshtein distance can be used to subgroup languages without the intensive time
requirement of the comparative method (Brown et al 2007) or the potential subjec-
tivity involved in identifying sound correspondences (Serva and Petroni 2008). The
Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein 1966) is a string comparison metric that counts the
number of edit operations (replacements, insertions, and deletions) required to trans-
form one string into another (Kruskal 1983). For example, the Levenshtein distance
between the Mussau and Tongan cognate words tolu is 0, and the difference between tolu
and Javanese telu is 1 (a replacement of the /e/ with /o/). This is usually normalized by
dividing by the length of the longest word (Brown et al 2007; Serva and Petroni 2008),
so the distance between tolu/telu is 0.25.
This Levenshtein classification has recently been applied to the Indo-European
(Serva and Petroni 2008; Tria et al 2010), Austronesian (Petroni and Serva 2008), Turkic
(van der Ark et al 2007), Indo-Iranian (van der Ark et al 2007), Mayan, Mixe-Zoque,
Otomanguean, Huitotoan-Ocaina, Tacanan, Chocoan, Muskogean, and Austro-Asiatic
language families (Brown et al 2007; Holman et al 2008; Bakker et al 2009). The
results of Levenshtein classification have even been used to explore broader questions
such as the relationship between population size and the rates of language evolution
(Wichmann and Holman 2009), the dates of human population expansions (Serva and
Petroni 2008; Wichmann and Holman 2009; Wichmann et al 2010), whether languages
arise and go extinct at a constant rate (Holman 2010), and to triangulate the homelands
of language families (Wichmann, Mu?ller, and Velupillai 2010).
Proponents of Levenshtein classification have claimed that the results are very simi-
lar to that of the comparative method. However, to date there has been no rigorous
attempt to quantify the performance of the Levenshtein distance at classifying lan-
guages. For example, Petroni and Serva (2008) use the Levenshtein distance to classify
50 Austronesian languages, and claim that their obtained language phylogeny is ?sim-
ilar? to the results of the comparative method. However, close inspection of their clas-
sification reveals some puzzling incongruities. Their tree correctly places the Atayalic
subgroup of the Formosan languages at the base of the tree (Blust 1999), but the next
subgrouping on the tree is the large Oceanic subgroup before the rest of the Formosan
languages are encountered. According to the comparative method, the Austronesian
language family has a highly rake-like structure, and the Oceanic subgroup should
be nested within Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian and Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
(Blust 1993, 2009; Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009). Instead, the Levenshtein
classification looks more like the results from a lexicostatistical analysis (Swadesh 1952;
Embleton 1985), which incorrectly inferred the base of the Austronesian phylogeny to be
in Near Oceania (Dyen 1965). This alternative tree topology has been largely discounted
as a methodological error due to an inability of the lexicostatistical methodology to
handle differences in the rates of lexical change (Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Blust 2000;
Greenhill and Gray 2009).

Greenhill Accuracy of Levenshtein Classification
The incongruities between the Levenshtein classification and the comparative
method demonstrates the need for a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the
Levenshtein distance for genealogically subgrouping languages. The large Austrone-
sian language family is a good test case for evaluating the accuracy of comparative
methods (Greenhill and Gray 2009; Greenhill, Drummond, and Gray 2010). First, the
major subgroups of the Austronesian language family are well established (Dempwolff
1934, 1937, 1938; Grace 1959; Pawley 1972; Dahl 1973; Blust 1978, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2009;
Ross 1988; Ross and N?ss 2007). Second, most subgroups in the Austronesian family
can be identified from the basic vocabulary commonly used for Levenshtein classifica-
tion (Greenhill, Drummond, and Gray 2010). Third, there is a large-scale database of
Austronesian vocabulary available for such a test: the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary
Database (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008). In this article, I attempt to evaluate the ac-
curacy of the Levenshtein classification method for identifying genealogical subgroups.
2. Method
The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (ABVD) (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008)
is a large collection of basic vocabulary word lists from over 650 Austronesian lan-
guages. Each word list comprises 210 items such as words for body parts, kinship
terms, colors, numbers, verbs, nouns, and so forth. These items are thought to be highly
stable over time and resistant to being borrowed between languages (Swadesh 1952).
From this database I extracted the word lists for 473 languages that belonged to the
Austronesian language family and were not reconstructed proto-languages.
To compare the performance of the Levenshtein classification to the traditional
subgroupings I subsampled triplets of languages from these data 10,000 times. The
correct classification of triplets is the simplest possible subgrouping task, with only four
possible subgroupings: language A is more similar to language B than C (A,B|C), A
is closer to C (A,C|B), B is closer to C (B,C|A), and no language is closer to the other
(A,B,C). Restricting the comparison to triplets has the advantage of not requiring a
tree construction algorithm to infer the topology, and hence avoids adding uncertainty
caused by the phylogenetic reconstruction process (Susko, Inagaki, and Roger 2004).
For each language triplet I obtained the expected linguistic subgrouping from the
Ethnologue database (Lewis 2009). The Ethnologue is the primary catalogue of language
information about the world?s languages. Each language has a classification string as-
sociated with it that categorizes the language into a nested set of subgroups that are de-
rived from primary historical linguistic research. It could be argued that the Ethnologue
classification lags behind linguistic research (Campbell and Grondona 2008). However,
the deeper structure of the Austronesian language family has been well established for a
long time (Dempwolff 1934, 1937, 1938; Grace 1959; Pawley 1972; Dahl 1973; Blust 1978,
1991, 1993, 1999, 2009; Ross 1988), and the recent release of the Ethnologue has updated
the classification to match even quite newly identified language subgroups like Temotu
(Ross and N?ss 2007).
The normalized Levenshtein distance between each language pair in the three-
language sample was calculated as follows. In each of the 210 words in the ABVD word
lists, one entry was selected for each language. Where the ABVD had multiple entries
for a word in a language one of the entries was sampled at random. The Levenshtein
distance was then calculated for each pair of words (word 1 in language A vs. word 1
in language B; word 2 in language A vs. word 2 in language B; etc.), and normalized by
dividing by the length of the longer word (Brown et al 2007; Holman et al 2008; Serva
and Petroni 2008). When one of the language pairs had no entries for a given word the
691
Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4
word pair was ignored. The average normalized Levenshtein distance for all 210 words
between each pair of languages in the three-language sample was taken as a measure
of relatedness between the language pairs. These averaged distances were then used to
select the most appropriate of the four possible subgroupings (e.g., A,B|C, or A,C|B or
B,C|A or A,B,C). The subgrouping estimated from the Levenshtein distances was then
evaluated as correct when it matched the subgrouping obtained from the Ethnologue.
A potential problem with this large-scale comparison is that the language data in
the ABVD have varying orthographies. These differences in orthographies might play
a crucial role in the accuracy of the Levenshtein distance to correctly infer language
relationships. The ABVD contains word lists from many different sources of data,
but there are some subsets that contain consistent orthography. To assess the effect of
orthography on the Levenshtein distance comparison, I repeated the given procedure
while sampling from three different subsets of languages. The first of these subsets is
composed of word lists for 121 languages across the Austronesian region obtained from
the linguist Robert Blust (Blust 2000, 2009), and these are transcribed in Blust?s standard
orthography. In contrast, the second two subsets are composed of detailed language
surveys of 91 languages from the Solomon Islands described in Tryon and Hackman
(1983), and 45 Philippines languages described in Reid (1971).
3. Results
The average Levenshtein distance between each sampled pair of languages in the
full 473-language sample was 0.847 (s.d., 0.063). In the Blust language subsample the
average Levenshtein distance was 0.846 (s.d., 0.047). The average distance for the Tryon
and Hackman (1983) and Reid (1971) languages was 0.772 (s.d., 0.120) and 0.771 (s.d.,
0.121), respectively. Cronbach?s alpha (Nerbonne and Heeringa 2009) calculated on all
inter-item distances between 1,000 random language pairs showed an alpha of 0.99,
suggesting that the signal measured by the Levenshtein distance was consistent.
The ability of the Levenshtein distance to identify the correct subgrouping from
the three possible combinations was low. In the full 473-language subsample the
Levenshtein distance correctly identified 41.3% of the subgroupings. In the Blust lan-
guage subsample the accuracy was 36.9%. In the Tryon and Hackman (1983) and Reid
(1971) languages, the accuracy was higher at 65.8% and 64.3%, respectively.
It may be unfair to penalize the Levenshtein classification for resolving a subgroup
that Ethnologue did not. Discarding the comparisons when the expected classification
was unresolved (A,B,C) increased the accuracy marginally: 47.8% Full data set, 44.7%
Blust, 77.0% Tryon and Hackman (1983), and 76.8% Reid (1971).
4. Discussion
The performance of the Levenshtein distance at classifying the Austronesian languages
using basic vocabulary data was poor, with the correct subgroup chosen only 41.3% of
the time. The more standardized orthography in the Solomon Islands and Philippines
language subsets increased the accuracy of the classification to around 65%. This was
not the case for the Blust subsample, however, which scored the lowest accuracy of
36.90%. The relatively poor performance on the Blust subsample when compared to the
Solomons and Philippines samples suggests that further standardization might not in-
crease accuracy. The Blust languages are sampled right across the range of Austronesian
languages. In contrast, the other subsets are sampled from distinct regions and contain
languages within a restricted set of subfamilies (e.g., Temotu, Meso-Melanesian, and
692

South-East Solomonic for the Solomon Islands subset; and Greater-Central Philippines
and North Luzon for the Philippines subset).
The major limiting factor for classification accuracy using the Levenshtein distance
appears to be phylogenetic distance: how closely the languages are related. Figure 1
plots the average number of Ethnologue classification nodes in each three-language
subset (Treelength) against the proportion of correct Levenshtein classifications for the
two language subsets spanning the largest range of subgroups (the Full data set, and
the Blust subsample). This figure shows that as the phylogenetic distance between
languages increases, the Levenshtein distance is less accurate at choosing the correct
classification. This finding is concordant with studies that have applied the Levenshtein
distance to dialect-level data and have generally shown strong congruence between
the subgroupings estimated by traditional dialectology methods and the Levenshtein
distance (Kessler 1995; Gooskens and Heeringa 2004; Heeringa et al 2006; Nerbonne
and Heeringa 2009). Interestingly, Figure 1 hints at an increase in accuracy with very
large phylogenetic distances, perhaps suggesting a potential role for the Levenshtein
distance for discriminating between different language families (van der Ark et al 2007).

Why is the accuracy of the Levenshtein method so low? The major cause of this
poor performance is that the Levenshtein distance is linguistically naive in at least four
ways. First, the Levenshtein distance blurs the distinction between cognate and non-
cognate words. Dialect studies generally explore the change within a cognate set where
the Levenshtein distance between entries is generally one or two character changes.
In contrast, when classifying languages, the metric conflates two different processes:
change within a cognate set and change between cognate sets. The distance between
two cognate words (e.g., tolu and telu) is small (0.25), however, calculating the distance
between two different cognate sets tolu and (for example) Marovo hike gives a maxi-
mally different string comparison. When words are very different, then the Levenshtein
distance is more likely to reflect chance similarity.
Second, the Levenshtein distance identifies the surface similarity between words.
Historical linguistics is skeptical about surface similarity for geneaological classification
(Ringe 1992; Durie and Ross 1996), however, as surface similarity could reflect borrow-
ing, sound symbolism, onomatopoeia, nursery forms, or chance instead of phylogenetic
relationships (Campbell and Poser 2008).
Third, processes like metathesis, reduplication, and fossilization of affixes can in-
volve multiple character differences but only occur as one change. For example, Malay
takut ?to fear? is cognate with Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ma-takut ?fearful, afraid? (Blust
2009). The *ma- is a stative prefix that has a tendency to become fossilized (Blust
2009). Rather than a single change, the Levenshtein distance would represent this as
two or three insertions/deletions. The third issue is that, under the Levenshtein, all
phonological changes are equally likely and occur at the same rates. In reality, some
changes occur very rarely whereas others occur frequently and repeatedly (e.g. /t/ to
/k/ is thought to have occurred independently at least 20 times within Austronesian
[Blust 2004]). In a good model, these frequent changes should have lower penalties than
other changes that are more unlikely.
A final cause of this poor classification performance is a result of subgrouping
languages according to an overall distance metric. Intuitively, clustering according to
minimal distance makes sense, although this has two consequences. First, distance
metrics ignore the distinction between forms that are common retentions from an
ancestral language, and the forms that are shared innovations in a set of languages.
This distinction?a ?fundamental tenant of the comparative method? (Blust 2000,
page 314)?is critical for correct subgrouping (Brugmann 1884; Hennig 1966; Blust 2000;
Greenhill and Gray 2009). Second, distance metrics remove a large proportion of the
signal in the data and better classification performance is achieved when raw data are
used (Steel, Hendy, and Penny 1988). By using a distance-based subgrouping method
the Levenshtein is susceptible to exactly the same problems that classical lexicostatistics
faced (Swadesh 1952). In particular, there is a very high vulnerability to variation in
retention rates (Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Blust 2000; Greenhill and Gray 2009). Dyen
(1965) applied lexicostatistics to the Austronesian language family and interpreted the
results as indicating an origin in Melanesia, possibly in the Bismarck Archipelago north
of New Guinea. This contradicts sharply with the view from historical linguistics which
suggests Taiwan as the homeland (Blust 1999; Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009).
Blust (2000) has demonstrated that retention rates in Malayo-Polynesian languages
range from 5% to 60% over the last 4,000 years or so. The languages which have had
more replacement in basic vocabulary are predominantly those of Melanesia, where
there has been much contact-induced change as incoming Austronesian languages
encountered non-Austronesian languages (Ross 1996). Subgrouping the languages with
lower similarities placed these Melanesian languages at the base of the tree, and led to
694
Greenhill Accuracy of Levenshtein Classification
the incorrect inference of a Melanesian homeland (Blust 2000; Greenhill and Gray 2009).
A Levenshtein-derived classification of the Austronesian languages (Petroni and Serva
2008) makes an identical mistake, suggesting that this approach is just as adversely
affected by variations in retention rate. It is therefore crucial to use methods that can
use all the cognate data, and account for variation in rates of lexical change over time?
like Bayesian phylogenetic methods (Greenhill and Gray 2009).
Using the Levenshtein distance to automatically classify languages has many attrac-
tions. These results indicate that better methods and approaches need to be explored,
however. One approach would be to make a less linguistically naive distance. For
example, the algorithm could be altered to allow larger changes such as metathesis
and reduplication. Or the transposition weights could be modified to make transitions
between common sound changes less penalized. These weights could be adjusted using
evidence from historical linguistics (Blevins 2004), or using a more general acoustic
distance measure (Mielke 2005). One step towards a more nuanced distance has been
taken by Wieling, Prokic?, and Nerbonne (2009), who modified the Levenshtein distance
to handle increased rates of metathesis in Bulgarian dialects and found a small increase
in performance on a string alignment task. A further modification using a Pointwise
Mutual Information method to learn the weights of phonetic transitions performed
better and had fewer errors than the modified Levenshtein.
Regardless of potential improvements, using a static metric like the Levenshtein
is still problematic. Processes like metathesis and reduplication are not necessarily
common in other languages or language families, and common sound changes are not
only phonetically constrained but are also constrained by the sounds already occurring
in a language. A superior approach would be to use an adaptive algorithm to learn
the transition weights from the data before classifying the languages using methods
like naive Bayesian classifiers (Dunning 1994; Ellison 2007), dynamic Bayesian networks
(Kondrak and Sherif 2006), or stochastic transducers (Ristad and Yianilos 1998). A recent
technique uses a probabilistic model of phonological change trained on a corpus of data
with an expectation-maximization algorithm to infer protoforms directly based on a
phylogeny (Bouchard-Co?te? et al 2008; Bouchard-Co?te?, Griffiths, and Klein 2009). Given
these new methods which promise substantial increases in performance, and the large
collection of established cognate data contained in databases like the ABVD that can
be used to train these algorithms, there is no reason to continue using the Levenshtein
distance to classify languages.
