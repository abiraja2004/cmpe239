Abstract 
Through the application of Chinese WordNet, 
the current study used the manipulation of 
visual field and the number of senses of the 
first character in Chinese disyllabic com-
pounds to investigate the representation and 
the hemispheric processing of related senses 
in nouns and verbs. In the previous study, 
Huang et al (2009) have found the ERP evi-
dence to indicate single entry representation 
for Chinese polysemy in the left hemisphere; 
however, in the right hemisphere, they found 
sense inhibition which may be due to (1) the 
nature of hemispheric processing in dealing 
with semantic ambiguity or (2) the semantic 
activation from the separate-entry representa-
tion for senses. To clarify these possibilities, 
the study used the word class judgment task 
with the attempt to push subjects in a deeper 
level of lexical processing. The results re-
vealed sense facilitation effect in the RH and 
suggested that in a deeper level, the RH had 
more possibility to observe the sense facilita-
tion due to different efficiency of cerebral 
hemispheres. 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Homonymy vs. polysemy  
Lexical ambiguity is very common in language. 
Linguistically, homonymy and polysemy are tradi-
tionally distinguished as two types of ambiguity. 
Early behavioral studies on semantic ambiguity 
obtained ambiguity advantage effects (e.g., Ru-
benstein et al, 1970; Jastrzembski, 1981, Millis & 
Button, 1989) in lexical decisions in which ambi-
guous words yielded faster reaction time than un-
ambiguous words. However, the same results were 
not replicated in some other studies (e.g., Bo-
rowsky & Masson, 1996; Azuma & Van Orden, 
1997). More recent psycholinguistic studies found 
that the so-called ambiguity advantage effects were 
in fact resulted from the activation of words having 
related senses rather than that of words having un-
related meanings (e.g., Rodd et al, 2002; Beretta et 
al., 2005; Pylkk?nen et al, 2006). These studies 
were generally in agreement with the linguistic 
assumption in that homonymy and polysemy might 
be represented differently in the mental lexicon. 
1.2 Hemispheric processing of semantic am-
biguity  
The issue of hemispheric processing in combina-
tion with lexical ambiguity have been widely stu-
died (e.g., Burgess & Simpson, 1988; Beeman & 
Chiarello, 1998; Faust & Lavidor, 2003) and sug-
gested that both cerebral hemispheres process word 
meanings in complementary ways. For example, 
Faust and Lavidor (2003) demonstrated that the 
LH benefited most from semantically congruent 
primes related to dominant meaning of ambiguous 
targets while the RH benefited most from semanti-
cally mixed primes. The overall pattern of priming 
was also suggestive of dissociation in the hemis-
pheric meaning retrieval, with the LH engaging in 
fine semantic coding that focused on a single 
meaning interpretation, and the RH engaging in 
coarser semantic coding where multiple alternate 
meanings were activated. Alternatively, Federmei-
45
er and Kutas (1999) offered electrophysiological 
data in a sentence comprehension task to present 
another explanation in hemispheric language 
processing. They suggested that while both hemis-
pheres involved in lexical resolution, they played 
different roles with the LH being ?predictive?, the 
RH being ?integrative?, to complement each other.  
    Pylkk?nen et al, (2006) were the first to focus 
on the investigation of how different but related 
senses were psychologically represented in the 
mental lexicon. Their MEG data suggested the sin-
gle-entry representation for related senses in the 
LH whereas they showed the sense inhibition in 
the RH and interpreted it as a potential sense com-
petition effect. In Chinese, Huang et al (2009) 
demonstrated similar patterns in their ERP data in 
which there was sense facilitation in the LH and 
sense inhibition in the RH. Nevertheless, the ques-
tion concerning the representation of related senses 
in the RH still left unresolved. Early studies on 
Chinese ambiguity such as Lin (1999) obtained 
ambiguity advantage but the calculation of ?senses? 
1included related and unrelated meanings and the 
effect was not reliable enough.  
1.3 Ambiguity in Chinese disyllabic com-
pounds 
In Chinese words recognition process, the issue of 
lexical ambiguity involves the composition of con-
stituent characters and how they contribute to the 
whole word reading. Chinese words differ from 
English in at least two aspects. First, about 80% of 
Chinese words are composed of two characters 
(Huang et al, 2006). Second, unlike the words in 
English, which every word is composed of letters 
corresponding to phonemes, Chinese words consist 
of characters corresponding to morphemes. In oth-
er words, each character in Chinese has its mor-
pheme(s) when they are embedded in two-
character compounds. Therefore, before we look 
into the lexical ambiguity of two-character words 
                                                          
1 The definition of ?sense? in Lin (1999) is different from the 
?sense advantage effect? demonstrated by Rodd et al (2002). 
Lin argued that ?meaning? in past research is used as a general 
term to refer to any kind of linguistic meaning. He claimed 
that, based upon Ahrens (1999) and Ahrens et al (1998), it is 
better to use ?sense? and ?facets? as a measure index. Though 
the ?number of senses? Lin used is a little different from the 
?number of meanings? used by Azuma and Van Orden (1997), 
it is regarded that Lin still did not solve the unreliable findings 
of ambiguity advantage effect.  
as lexical items, we should investigate the sense 
representation of its subcomponent, the representa-
tion of its single character within two-character 
compounds.  
In the circumstance which every character in 
the disyllabic compounds may contribute to word 
recognition, there still exists disparity between the 
roles of the first and second character. In light of 
the studies on the neighborhood size effect, word 
recognition process will be influenced by the com-
position of letters or characters. In English, faci-
litative neighborhood size effects and inhibitory 
neighborhood size effects were robust findings in 
low frequency words (e.g. Andrews, 1989, 1992; 
Grainger and Jacobs, 1996). In the Chinese neigh-
borhood size study (Huang et al, 2006) and eye 
movement study (Tsai et al, 2006), it was sug-
gested that the neighborhood size of the first cha-
racter constituent played a more important role in 
lexical processing than did neighborhood size of 
the second character constituent. Based on the as-
sumption that the first character will play a key 
role in whole word reading, the study primarily 
manipulated the number of senses of the first cha-
racter and attempted to reveal the hypotheses of 
sense representation in the context provided by the 
second character. 
The question left in Huang et al (2009) was 
that whether the sense inhibition in the RH was 
due to the nature of hemispheric processing in 
dealing with semantic ambiguity or the semantic 
activation from the separate-entry representation 
for senses. Considering the sense inhibition in the 
N400 of the ERP component, the pattern in their 
data was that words having many senses were 
more negative than those having few senses. That 
is, there existed competition when the first charac-
ters of the targets had many related senses. Never-
theless, based on the single entry assumption for 
related senses, we assumed sense facilitation for 
the representation of senses.  
In Huang et al (2009), they required subjects 
to make word/ non-word lexical decision, but sub-
jects might make their judgments based on percep-
tual familiarity rather than the involvement of 
lexical access. Previous studies on probabilistic 
phonotactics (Vitevitch and Luce, 1998) or on 
Chinese semantic combinability (Cheng, 2006) 
have demonstrated opposing effects in early and 
late levels of word processing. In order to clarify 
the results in Huang et al (2009), we designed the 
46
word class judgment task to deepen the difficulty 
of the experimental procedure. 
2 The experiment  
By changing the depth of the task, the goal of the 
experiment was to find out if, under the assump-
tion of single entry representation for senses, there 
was a chance to discover the sense facilitation in 
the RH. Suppose the representation of Chinese 
senses had single entry, words having more senses 
should be less negative than few senses in the 
N400 because of the benefits of semantic activa-
tion. On the contrary, if there were multiple entries 
for senses in the RH, words of more senses should 
be more negative than few senses and displayed 
semantic competition and inhibition. 
2.1 Participants  
38 college students (18 to28 years of age, mean 
age 22.39) took part in the experiment (male, right-
handedness). Written consent was obtained from 
all participants. The study was approved by the 
Taiwan governmental ethics committee.  
2.2 Materials 
120 Chinese disyllabic compounds, counterba-
lanced with word class (noun/ verb), were divided 
into four subsets according to visual field (LVF/ 
RVF) and NOS of the first character (few/ many 
senses). Few-sense words were those whose first 
character senses were from 1 to 3 (mean 1.97) 
whereas many-sense words were those whose first 
character senses were over 6 (mean 11.38). Possi-
ble confounding factors such as word frequency, 
NS1, NS2 were controlled.  
The number of senses in the current study was 
collected from the Chinese WordNet, a lexical cor-
pus of Mandarin Chinese and established by Aca-
demia Sinica in Taiwan. The corpus attempts to 
build an up-to-date Chinese lexical network and 
provides complete information of Chinese word 
senses.  
In Chinese, there exists controversy over the 
distinction of verbs and nouns. To avoid this prob-
lem, the resolutions included: (1) to label the word 
class according to the system established in Aca-
demia Sinica balanced corpus of modern Chinese 
and (2) to give pilot pretests to another group of 
people to exclude these possibly confused choices. 
These subjects were asked to use their language 
intuition to write down their word-class judgments 
in a paper sheet containing 120 targets.

2.3 Procedure 
Each trial began with a white cross presented cen-
trally for 500 ms. Presentation of the target words 
appeared on the screen for 150 ms. The disyllabic 
compound targets were vertically arranged in the 
left or right visual hemifield with inner edge two 
degrees of visual angle from fixation. Presentation 
of numbers from 1 to 9 appeared pseudorandomly 
in the center of the screen in order to control par-
ticipants? eyesight. At the end of each trial, a capi-
tal B was presented in the center to allow eye 
blinking for 1500 ms. Participants were asked not 
to blink their eyes until the appearance to the capi-
tal B to minimize the interference of eye move-
ment. 
Participants were instructed to judge whether 
the compound presented was a noun or a verb. For 
odd-number subjects, they were asked to press the 
response box with both of their index fingers when 
the targets were verbs and with both of their mid-
dle fingers when the targets were nouns. For even-
number subjects, the instruction was the opposite. 
To control the central fixation of eyes, numbers 
from 1 to 9 also appeared pseudorandomly. Odd-
number subjects should press the response box 
with both of their index fingers when number 6 to 
9 was presented centrally on the screen and with 
both of their middle fingers when number 1 to 4 
was on the screen. For even-number subjects, in-
struction reversed. Response time and event-
related potentials data were both collected during 
the process.

2.4 Event-related potential recording  
The electroencephalogram was recorded from 64 
electrodes embedded in an electro-cap(QuickCap, 
Neuromedical Supplies, Sterling, Texas, USA), 
referenced to the left and right mastoid, M1, M2 
respectively. Positions of all the electrodes were 
arranged according to the international ten-twenty 
system. The electroencephalogram was conti-
nuously recorded and digitized at a rate of 500 Hz. 
The signal was amplified by SYNAMPS2 (Neu-
roscan Inc., El Paso, Texas, USA) with the band-
pass set at 0.5?100 Hz. Blinks and eye movements 
were monitored via electrodes placed on the infra-
orbital ridges of the left eye (VEOG) and the outer 
canthus left and right electrode (HEOG). A ground 
electrode was placed on the forehead anterior to 
the FZ electrode. Electrode impedance was kept 
below 5 kohms.   
2.5 ERP components  
In the analyses of the ERP waveforms elicited by 
every stimulus in each condition, there were typi-
cally composed of a negative-going peak at around 
100ms (N1), a positive-going peak at around 
200ms (P200), a negative-going peak maximizing 
at around 400 ms (N400) over central and parietal 
electrode sites. Among these, N 170 was regarded 
as the early index for visual detection in word 
processing. In the current study, N170 was used to 
examine the manipulation of visual field. N400 
was characterized as an index sensitive to lan-
guage-related processing and was generally consi-
dered in response to violations of semantic 
expectations (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980). With the 
presentation of a semantically inappropriate or in-
congruent word, a large N400 activity would be 
elicited. In Huang et al (2009), the 400 in the RH 
was regarded as sense competition because words 
with many senses elicit more negativity at around 
400 ms.  
3 Results  
Behavioral accuracy below 70 percent and ERPs 
accepted trials below 16 were excluded from 
ANOVA analyses. Data from 28 of participants 
were used in the following behavioral and ERP 
analyses. 
3.1 Behavioral data 
A 2?2 (number of senses ? visual field) analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was performed on correct RTs 
and accuracy. For RTs, no significant main effect 
of number of senses (F (1, 27) =0.5, p=.48) and 
interaction (F (1, 27) =1.33, p=.26) was observed. 
A main effect of visual field reached marginally 
significance (F (1, 27) = 3.38, p=.077). Stimuli 
presented to RVF/ LH had the tendency to produce 
shorter response time than those presented to LVF/ 
RH. For accuracy, not any main effect or interac-
tion was obtained. 
3.2 ERP data 
Temporal time windows of interest were N170 
(150-180 ms) and N400 (350-500 ms). The mean 
amplitude of each time window from selected elec-
trodes served as dependent measures in a repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
3.2.1 N170 (150-180 ms) 
The mean amplitude of N170 was analyzed by 
ANOVA with factors of visual field (LVF/RVF), 
number of senses, and electrodes (P3/P4, P5/P6, 
P7/P8, PO5/ PO6). We obtained a significant visu-
al field ? electrodes interaction F (7,189) =45.34, 
p<.001. Post-hoc comparison indicated that visual 
field simple main effects reached statistical signi-
ficance in all electrodes (p?s<.001). In electrodes 
on the left, P3, P5, P7, PO5, right visual field pres-
entation elicited much greater negativity than left 
visual presentation and vice versa in electrodes on 
the right, P4, P6, P8, and PO8.  
3.2.2 N400 (350-500 ms) 
Mean amplitudes of all conditions were measured 
from 350 to 500ms and subjected to ANOVA with 
48
factors of visual field, the number of senses, elec-
trodes, hemispheres. The midline analysis revealed 
marginal significance of two way interaction be-
tween the number of senses and visual field (F (1, 
27) =3.83, p=.06). In the lateral analysis, there was 
marginal significance of visual field by number of 
senses interaction (F (1, 27) = 3.18, p=.086) and a 
marginally significant 4-way interaction of visual 
field, number of senses, electrodes and hemis-
pheres (F (4, 108) =2.53, p=.072). Post-hoc com-
parisons showed that in the LVF/ RH few senses 
tended to be more negative than many senses 
(p<.05) while in the RVF/ LH, few and many 
senses did not reveal any difference (p=.73).

4 Discussion  
In the behavioral data, no significant main effect of 
the number of senses and interaction was observed. 
Nevertheless, the ERP data demonstrated that there 
was marginal significance of two-way interaction 
(visual field ? number of senses) and a marginally 
significant 4-way interaction. Post-hoc comparison 
showed that there were significant sense facilita-
tion effects in the RH and no effect in the LH. ERP 
waveforms showed that words of few senses eli-
cited more negativity than words of many senses 
around 400 ms in the RH, but the two conditions 
did not differ from each other in the LH. 
The marginality of statistical significance led 
to the speculation in that the word category effect 
might dilute the sense effect in the experiment. 
Many studies, in general, suggested that the neural 
systems for lexical processing of nouns and verbs 
were anatomically distinct. For example, in child-
ren?s lexical development, the acquisition of nouns 
seems to be earlier and easier than that of verbs 
(Gentner, 1982). In aphasic findings, case studies 
indicated that patients with lesions located in left 
anterior and middle temporal lobe, outside so 
called language areas, had difficulty in the produc-
tion of nouns whereas patients with lesions areas in 
left frontal premotor cortex had difficulty in the 
production of verbs (Damasio & Damasio, 1992; 
Damasio et al, 1993). Evidence from event-related 
potentials also disclosed electrocortical differences 
between nouns and verbs over widespread cortical 
areas (Pulverm?ller et al, 1999). Therefore, verbs 
were assumed to elicit stronger electrocortical ac-
tivity around primary frontal, prefrontal areas as-
sociated with motor, premotor functions. Nouns, 
associated with concrete and well-imaginable 
meanings related to visual modality, were assumed 
to elicit larger electrocortical activity around visual 
cortices. 
There was also evidence indicating that the 
conclusions were oversimplified. For example, 
Tyler et al (2001, PET) found no significant action 
differences for nouns and verbs in lexical decision 
and semantic categorization task. Similarly, in an 
fMRI Chinese study, Li et al (2004) pointed out 
that nouns and verbs were found to activate a wide 
range of overlapping brain areas and suggested 
distributed networks for either word class. One 
recent Chinese study on concreteness also showed 
similar distribution over the scalp for both nouns 
and verbs (Tsai et al, 2008).  
The study was not meant to resolve the con-
troversy of neural representations for nous and 
verbs. Instead, from the marginal significance of 
the data in the experiment, we speculated that the 
word class effect may influence the results, which 
led to the failure to reach significance in overall 
data. Therefore, we reanalyzed the data with the 
addition word class as one within-subject factor. 
4.1 Re-analyses 
49
To further examine the sense effect in nouns and 
verbs condition, separate analyses of ANOVA 
were carried out according to different word 
classes. 
4.2 Behavioral data 
A 2?2?2 (number of senses ? visual field ? word 
class) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was per-
formed on correct RTs and accuracy. For RTs, re-
sults showed marginally significant effects for 
visual field (F (1, 27) = 3.38, p=.077) and word 
class (F (1, 27) = 2.97, p=.096) and for number of 
senses ? word class interaction (F (1, 27) = 2.94, 
p=.098). Stimuli presented to the RVF/ LH tended 
to responded more quickly than to the LVF/ RH. 
Stimuli of nouns had shorter response time than 
stimuli of verbs. For accuracy analysis, nouns had 
significant higher accuracy than verbs (word class 
(F (1, 27) =5.41, p<.05). 
4.3 ERP data 
The grand mean ERPs elicited by few and many 
senses in RVF/ LH and LVF/ RH were presented 
in nouns and verbs separately.  
4.3.1 Nouns  
In the midline, there was a marginally significant 
number of senses ? electrodes interaction (F (4, 
108) = 2.8, p<.08). Lateral analyses indicated that 
there was a significant visual field ? number of 
senses ? electrode interaction (F (1, 27) = 3.65, 
p<.05). Planned comparison showed that only 
when stimuli presented to the LVF/ RH, few 
senses were more negative in C, CP, P (p?s <.05 to 
<.01).  
4.3.2 Verbs 
In the midline analysis, there was no significant 
main effect of senses or interaction. In the lateral 
analyses, there were significant interactions of vis-
ual field ?  number of senses (F (1, 27) =4.69, 
p<.05) and visual field ? number of senses ? elec-
trodes ? hemispheres (F (4, 108) = 4.23, p<.01). 
Planned comparisons of four way interaction 
showed that when presented to LVF/ RH, few 
senses were more negative in F3, C3, CP3 and FC4 
(p?s<.05 to <.01) whereas when presented to the 
RVF/ LH, there was no difference between few 
and many senses.  
5 Discussion  
The purpose of additional analyses of sense effects 
in nouns and verbs was to examine clearer effects 
of senses without the confounding of the word 
class factor. The separate analyses for nouns and 
verbs both showed significant sense effects in the 
lateral sites. Furthermore, planned comparison of 
the senses demonstrated disparate distributions for 
nouns and verbs respectively. To be more specific, 
the sense effects for nouns were located in central-
to-parietal areas of brain, whereas these effects for 
verbs primarily showed up in frontal, central, cen-
tral-parietal electrodes on the left. The re-analyses 
of ERP data showed that the differences of distri-
bution from either word category diluted the sense 
effect observed in the first analysis; therefore, the 
data was only marginally significant in the original 
analyses. Besides, though the current study was not 
meant to resolve the representations for different 
word categories, the additional results seemed to 
support the distinct neural representations for 
nouns and verbs, since each word class had its dis-
tribution for the sense effects. Certainly, further 
evidence of Chinese word class was required to 
approve the statement since there was also evi-
dence suggesting distributed network for Chinese 
lexical processing (e.g. Li et al, 2004).  
According to previous studies, different levels 
of processing in perception of words would lead to 
opposing results (e.g. Vitevitch and Luce, 1998; 
Cheng, 2006). Suppose the results were derived 
from the single entry representation of senses, the 
sense effect should be observed in the RH in the 
experiment since the depth of the task was changed. 
In other words, when subjects were undergoing a 
deeper level of lexical processing, the relatedness 
of senses might have been early processed in the 
LH due to the engagement in fine semantic 
processing; on the other hand, the sense effect 
might appear in the RH because its capacity al-
lowed alternate meanings to maintain. Hence, in a 
deeper level of task, which slowed down the se-
mantic processing, the facilitative sense effect was 
observed in the RH.   
Overall, we suggested that the representation 
of Chinese senses be single entry and obtained the 
sense facilitation effects in LVF/ RH in which few 
50
senses were more negative than many senses both 
in nouns and verbs. We assumed that the results 
also provided empirical evidence indicating that 
the construction of Chinese WordNet has psycho-
logical validity.  
6 Conclusions 
The study attempted to find out whether the repre-
sentation of senses in the RH was single-or sepa-
rate-entry. When the depth of task was changed, 
the RH advantage for the processing of semantical-
ly related senses was observed. The finding was 
consistent with recent studies on the representation 
of polysemy (e.g. Beretta et al 2005; Pylkk?nen et 
al. 2006, Rodd et al, 2002).
