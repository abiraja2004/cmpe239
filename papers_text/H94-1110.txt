PROJECT GOALS 
The general objective of this research as been the enhance- 
ment of traditional key-word based statistical methods of doc- 
ument retrieval with advanced natural anguage processing 
techniques. In the work to date the focus has been on obtain- 
ing a better epresentation f document contents by extracting 
representative phrases from syntactically preprocessed text 
and devising suitable weighting schemes for different types 
of terms. In addition, statistical clustering methods have 
been developed that generate domain-specific term correla- 
tions which can be used to obtain better search queries via 
expansion. 
RECENT RESULTS 
A prototype t xt retrieval system has been developed in which 
a robust natural language processing module is integrated with 
a traditional statistical engine (NIST's PRISE). Natural an- 
guage processing is used to (1) preprocess the documents in 
order to extract contents-carrying terms, (2) discover inter- 
term dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific 
to the database domain, and (3) process user's natural an- 
guage requests into effective search queries, The statistical 
engine builds inverted index files from pre-processed docu- 
ments, and then searches and ranks the documents inresponse 
to user queries. The feasibility of this approach as been 
demonstrated in various experiments with 'standard' IR col- 
lections uch as CACM-3204 and Cranfield, as well as in the 
large-scale evaluation with TIPSTER database. 
The centerpiece of the natural language processing module 
is the 'ITP parser, a fast and robust syntactic analyzer which 
produces 'regularized' parse structures out of running text. 
The parser, presently the fastest of this type, is designed to 
produce full analyses, but is capable of generating approx- 
imate 'best-fit' structures if under a time pressure or when 
faced with unexpected input. 
We also developed and improved the morphological word 
stemmer, syntactic dependencies xtractor, and tested several 
clustering formulas. In a close co-operation with BBN, we 
used their POST part-of-speech tagger which is an essential 
pre-processor before parsing. 
During last year TTP licenses have been issued to several sites 
for research purposes and one commercial license is pending. 
The main effort during TREC-2 was on generating appropriate 
term-based representation f documents for improved search 
performance. Documents were indexed with a mixture of 
statistical terms (words and stems) and linguistically derived 
phrases. Subsequently a new method for weighting mixed 
sets of terms has been developed which produced asignificant 
increase in retrieval precision. 
In another effort, in co-operation with the Canadian Institute 
of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS), a number of qual- 
itative methods for predicting semantic orrectness of word 
associations are being tested. When finished, these results 
will be used to further improve the accuracy of document 
representation with compound terms. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
A major effort in the coming months is the participation i  
TREC-3 evaluation. Work will continue on improved term 
weighting methods, term derivation and disambiguation tech- 
niques, and automatic feedback for routing. More clustering 
methods will be tested ,for generating term similarities, as 
well as more effective filters to subcategorize similarities into 
semantic lasses. We plan to move from category B partici- 
pation (exploratory systems) to category A (full data set). 
This site has also be~n selected as a TIPSTER Phase 2 con- 
tractor. As a part of this contract an integrated system for 
document retrieval and information extraction will be built. 
We participated in the second Text Retrieval Conference 
(TREC-2), during which the total of 850 MBytes of Wall 
Street Journal and San Jose Mercury News articles have been 
parsed. An enhanced version of TrP parser has been devel- 
oped for this purpose with the average speed generally below 
0.2 seconds per sentence (approx. 85 words per second).
