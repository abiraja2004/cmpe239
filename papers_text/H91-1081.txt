OBJECT IVES 
The objective of this project is to develop a real- 
time spoken language system capable of 
understanding and responding to spoken English 
commands and queries for interactive human- 
machine applications, uch as battle management, 
command and control, and training of personnel on 
complex tasks. The system will also include a 
capability to adapt o new speakers and a capability 
to detect when a user says a new word, and to allow 
the user to add the word to the system. 
ACCOMPL ISHMENTS 
Work in this area requires the integration of three 
technologies: large-vocabulary continuous peech 
recognition, natural anguage understanding, and 
system integration. In our work at BBN, we have 
integrated our BYBLOS continuous speech 
recognition technology with a new natural language 
understanding component, DELPHI, resulting in a 
complete spoken language system, called HARC 
(Hear And Respond to Continuous peech). A 
major accomplishment of this project has been the 
development of a real-time version of HARC, 
implemented completely on commercially-available 
hardware. An N-best version of BYBLOS (see 
below) running in real-time has been implemented 
on a Sun 4 with a Sky Challenger signal 
processing board. The DELPHI natural anguage 
component also runs on a Sun 4. The complete 
system has been interfaced recently to a DARPA- 
sponsored military logistical planning system, 
called DART (Dynamic Analysis Replanning 
Tool). 
The DELPHI natural anguage component uses a 
Unification formalism for describing the syntax and 
semantics of English and for enforcing syntactic 
and semantic onstraints. It uses a higher-order 
intensional logic for representing the meaning of a 
sentence. The system provides for the incremental 
application of syntax and semantics; advantages of
this approach are that unproductive s arch paths are 
cut off more quickly, and any improvements in
unification parsing apply automatically to 
semantics as well as syntax. We have implemented 
unification semantics for our grammar rules in four 
task domains: battle management, personnel 
information retrieval, airline travel information 
retrieval, and military logistical planning. We have 
interfaced and extended the JANUS discourse 
module, developed under an earlier DARPA effort, 
to the HARC system. We also developed a method 
for rapid porting of the natural anguage component 
to new task domains using the Parlance Learner TM 
knowledge acquisition tool. Recent 
accomplishments in DELPHI include parsing 
speedups, streamlining the unification grammar, 
and introducing mapping units into the semantic 
processing. Syntactic and semantic parsing of a 
sentence now takes less than one second on average 
on a Sun 4. 
One important contribution has been the 
development of the N-best search strategy for 
integrating speech and natural language 
components. This method produces the N highest 
scoring sentences that match an input utterance, 
aided by a statistical language model. The natural 
language component hen searches these N 
sentences for the highest scoring sentence for which 
the system can produce a semantic interpretation. 
The N-best paradigm, by providing a clean and 
simple interface between speech and natural 
language, has found immediate acceptance as the 
method of choice in spoken language integration. 
An efficient two-pass (forward-backward) algorithm 
for obtaining the N-best sentences has allowed the 
implementation f the algorithm in real-time on a 
Sun 4. 
In this project, we have been instrumental in the 
design of methodologies for the collection of 
spoken language data and the objective valuation 
of spoken language systems. We previously helped 
specify the DARPA Resource Management Corpus 
that is now in common use for speech recognition 
evaluation. More recently, our proposals for the 
evaluation of spoken language systems have been 
adopted by the DARPA community. 
We have developed what we believe to be the first 
successful method for the automatic detection of 
out-of-vocabulary words. This is an important 
problem for any realistic system with a large 
vocabulary. Initial results show a 70% detection 
rate with only 1% false alarm. We have recently 
developed a capability for the addition of new words 
to a speech recognition system.
