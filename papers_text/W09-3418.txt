Abstract 
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-
24613) is the ISO standard which provides 
a common standardized framework for the 
construction of natural language 
processing lexicons. LMF facilitates data 
exchange among computational linguistic 
resources, and also promises a convenient 
uniformity for future application. This 
study describes the design and implemen-
tation of the WordNet-LMF used to 
represent lexical semantics in Chinese 
WordNet. The compiled CWN-LMF will 
be released to the community for linguis-
tic researches.  
1 Introduction 
Princeton WordNet1 is an English lexical data-
base that groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and 
adverbs into sets of cognitive synonyms, which 
are named as synsets (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller, 
1995).  The Global WordNet Association 
(GWA)2 built on the results of Princeton Word-
Net and Euro WordNet (Vossen, 2004) is a free 
and public association that provides a platform to 
share and connect all languages in the world. For 
Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, Huang et al (2004) 
constructed the Academia Sinica Bilingual Onto-
logical Wordnet (Sinica BOW) which integrates 
WordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equiva-

2 Global WordNet Association (GWA), available on-
line at http://www.globalwordnet.org/ 
lents Database (ECTED) and SUMO for cross-
language linguistic studies. As a follow-up, Chi-
nese WordNet (CWN) has been built as a robust 
lexical knowledge system which also embodies a 
precise expression of sense relations (Huang et 
al., 2008). In recent years, WordNet-like re-
sources have become one of the most reliable 
and essential resources for linguistic studies for 
all languages (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000; So-
ria et al 2009; Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004).  
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-
24613) is the ISO standard which provides a 
common standardized framework for the con-
struction of natural language processing lexicons 
(Francopoulo et al, 2009).  One important pur-
pose of LMF is to define a standard for lexicons 
which covers multilingual lexical information 
(Francopoulo et al, 2006b). In this study, we 
describe the design and implementation of the 
Wordnet-LMF (Soria et al 2009) to represent 
lexical semantics in Chinese WordNet. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 introduces Chinese WordNet and Lexi-
cal Markup Framework. Section 3 describes how 
we represent Chinese WordNet in the Lexical 
Markup Framework (CWN-LMF). Section 4 
presents an example on Chinese word sense dis-
tinction using CWN-LMF format. Quantitative 
analysis of compiled CWN-LMF is presented in 
Section 5. We also describe the application sce-
nario using CWN-LMF for information interope-
rability of lexical semantics in Section 6. Section 
7 discusses the experience and difficulties of en-
coding CWN into Wordnet-LMF.  Finally, Sec-
tion 8 concludes this study with future research.

2 Related Work  
2.1 Chinese WordNet 
Creating a semantic relation-based language re-
source is a time consuming and labor intensive 
task, especially for Chinese due to the unobvious 
definition and distinction among characters, 
morphemes and words. Chinese WordNet 3  
(CWN) has been built by Academia Sinica and is 
successively extended its scope so far. Lemmas 
included in CWN mainly fall on the medium fre-
quency words. Each lexical entry is analyzed 
according to the guidelines of Chinese word 
sense distinctions (CKIP, 2003; Huang et al 
2003) which contain information including Part-
of-Speech, sense definition, example sentences, 
corresponding English synset(s) from Princeton 
WordNet, lexical semantic relations and so on. 
Unlike Princeton WordNet, CWN has not been 
constructed mainly on the synsets and semantic 
relations. Rather it focuses to provide precise 
expression for the Chinese sense division and the 
semantic relations needs to be based on the lin-
guistic theories, especially lexical semantics 
(Huang et al, 2008). Moreover, Huang et al 
(2005) designed and implemented the Sinica 
Sense Management System (SSMS) to store and 
manage word sense data generated in the analy-
sis stage. SSMS is meaning-driven. Each sense 
of a lemma is identified specifically using a 
unique identifier and given a separate entry. 
There are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses until 
December 2008 have been analyzed and stored 
in SSMS. Figure 1 shows the result of sense dis-
tinction for ?? zu-ji ?footprint? as an example 
in Chinese WordNet. 
Huang et al (2004) proposed Domain Lexico-
Taxonomy (DLT) as a domain taxonomy popu-
lated with lexical entries. By using DLT with 
Chinese WordNet and Domain Taxonomy, there 
were 15,160 Chinese senses that linked and dis-
tributed in 463 domain nodes. In addition, Huang 
et al (2005) further applied DLT approach to a 
Chinese thesaurus called as CiLin and showed 
with evaluation that DLT approach is robust 
since the size and number of domain lexica in-
creased effectively.

ji1 (footprint)?. 
2.2 Lexical Markup Framework  
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-24613) 
is the ISO standard for natural language 
processing lexicons and machine readable dic-
tionaries. The goals of LMF are to provide a 
common model for the creation and use of lexi-
cal resources, and to manage the exchange of 
data between them. Francopoulo et al (2006a; 
2009) offered a snapshot of how LMF represents 
multilingual lexicons. LMF facilitates data ex-
change among computational linguistic resources 
and also promises a convenient uniformity for 
future application. More updated information can 
be found online 
at http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org . 
                                                
Soria et al (2009) proposed a Wordnet-LMF 
developed in the framework of the KYOTO 4  
project as a standardized interoperability format 
for the interchange of lexico-semantic informa-
tion. Wordnet-LMF is an LMF dialect tailored to 
encode lexical resources adhering to the Word-

Net model of lexical knowledge representation. 
Wordnet-LMF was designed by adhering to LMF 
principles yet taking into account on the one 
hand, the peculiarities of the Wordnet model, and 
on the other by trying to maximize the efficiency 
of the format.  
If we take Princeton WordNet 3.0 synset

presentation can be found in Figure 2. The de-
tails will be explained in Section 3.

ation 
lInformation is used 
label=?Compile Chinese 
work (CWN-LMF) 
Wordnet-LMF is used to represent le
mantics in Chinese WordNet. As LexicalRe-
source is the root element in Wordnet-LMF, it 
has three children: one GlobalInformation ele-
ment, one or more Lexicon elements, zero or one 
SenseAxes element. This means the object Lexi-
calResource is the container for possibly more 
than one lexicon; inter-lingual correspondences 
are grouped in SenseAxes section. The details are 
presented as follows. 
3.1 Global Inform
The element named as Globa
to describe general information about the lexical 
resource. The attribute ?label? is a free text field. 
Example as follows: 
<GlobalInformation 
Wordnet entries using Wordnet-LMF?> 
3.2  Lexicon 
In CWN-LMF, only one element Lexicon is used 
to contain a monolingual resource as a set of 
LexicalEntry instances followed by a set of Syn-
set elements. The following attributes are speci-
fied: 
 
z languageCoding: It has ?ISO 639-3? as a 
fixed value. 
z language: The standardized 3-letter lan-
guage coding, e.g. zho, is used to spe-
cify the language represented by the 
lexical resource. It is a required 
attribute. 
z owner: It is a required attribute to speci-
fy the copyright holder 
z version: It is a required attribute to speci-
fy the resource version. 
z label: It is used to record additional in-
formation that may be needed. This 
attribute is optional. 
 
Example as follows:  
<Lexicon languageCoding=?ISO 639-3? la-
bel=?Chinese WordNet 1.6? language=?zho?, 
owner=?Academia Sinica?, version=?1.6?>. 
3.2.1 Lexical Entry 
A LexicalEntry element can contain one lemma 
and one sense and has an optional attribute ?id? 
which means a unique identifier.  
The element, Lemma, represents a word form 
chosen by convention to designate the lexical 
entry. It contains the following attributes: 
 
z partOfSpeech: It is a required attribute. 
This attribute takes as its value the 
part-of ?speech value that according 
to WordNet conventions is usually 
specified for a synset. There are four 
part-of-speech notations that are used 
in CWN-LMF. The notation ?n? is 
represented as a noun; the notation 
?v? is represented as a verb; the nota-
tion ?a? is represented as an adjective; 
the notation ?r? is represented as an 
adverb; and the other POS tags are 
represented as ?s?. 
z writtenForm: It is added in case that ?id? 
of LexicalEntry is numerical and it 
takes Unicode strings as values. This 
attribute is optional. 
 
 
125
The Sense element represents one meaning of 
a lexical entry. For WordNet representation, it 
represents the variant of a synset. Required 
attributes are:  
 
z id: It must be specified according to the 
convention used in Chinese WordNet, 
i.e. word_sense#nr.. For example, ??
?_1? means that the first sense of 
lemma ?? huan-jing ?environment?. 
z synset:  It takes as its value the ID of the 
synset to which the particular sense of 
the variant belongs. The ID of the 
synset will be described in the next 
subsection.  
 
Take the first sense of lemma ?? huan-jing 
?environment? for example, it will be represented 
as follows: 
<LexicalEntry> 
  <Lemma writtenForm="??" partOfS-
peech="n"></Lemma> 
     <Sense id="??_1" synset=" zho-16-
06640901-n"></Sense> 
</LexicalEntry> 
3.2.2 Synset 
This element encodes information about a Chi-
nese WordNet synset. Synset elements can con-
tain one Definition, optional SynsetRelations and 
MonolingualExternalRefs elements. Required 
attributes for Synset element are the following: 
 
z id: It is a unique identifier. The agreed 
syntax is ?languageCode-version-id-
POS?.  For example, ?zho-16-
06640901-n? is unique identifier of 
the first sense of lemma ?? huan-
jing ?environment?. 
z baseConcept: Values for the baseCon-
cept attribute will be numerical (1,2,3), 
which correspond to the BaseConcept 
sets. If the sense belongs to the first-
class basic words of NEDO project 
(Tokunaga et al 2006), we encode it 
as 1.  Similarly, if the sense belongs to 
second-class basic words, we encode 
it as 2. The other senses will be en-
coded as 3 if they are not basic words. 
 
The element Definition allows the representa-
tion of the gloss associated with each synset in 
attribute ?gloss?. The required attribute ?exam-
ple? of the element Statement contains the exam-
ples of use associated with the synset . 
SynsetRelations is a bracketing element for 
grouping all SynsetRelation elements. Relations 
between synsets are codified by means of Synse-
tRelation elements, one per relation. Required 
attributes are: 
 
z target: It contains the ID value of the 
synset that is the target of the relation. 
z relType: It means the particular type. 
There are nine semantic relations in 
Chinese WordNet, including 
?has_synonym?, ?has_nearsynonym?, 
?has_hypernym?, ?has_hyponym?, 
?has_holonym?, ?has_meronym?, 
?has_paranym?, ?has_antonym? and 
?has_variant?. Among them, the se-
mantic relation paranymy is used to 
refer to relation between any two lexi-
cal items belonging to the same se-
mantic classification (Huang et al 
2008). For example, the set of 
?spring/summer/fall/winter?   has pa-
ranymy relation of main concept of 
?seasons in a year?. 
 
MonolingualExternalRefs is a bracketing ele-
ment to group all MonolingualExternalRef ele-
ments. MonolingualExternalRef elements must 
be used to represent links between a Sense or 
Synset and other resources, such as an ontology, 
a database or other lexical resources. Attributes 
are: 
 
z  externalSystem: It is a required attribute 
to describe the name of the external 
resource. For instance, possible values 
are ?domain? (Magnini and Cavaglia, 
2000), ?SUMO? (Niles and Pease, 
2001), and ?Wordnet 3.0? for record-
ing SenseKey values.   
z externalReference: It means the particu-
lar identifier or node. This attribute is 
required. 
z relType: It is optional attribute. If the 
?externalSystem? is ?SUMO?. ?rel-
Type? is the type of relations with 
SUMO ontology nodes. Possible val-
ues are ?at?, ?plus?, and ?equal?. 
 
 
 
 
 
126
We use the first sense of lemma ?? huan-
jing ?environment? to illustrate as follows: 
 
<Synset id="zho-16-06640901-n" baseCon-
cept="2"> 
<Definition gloss="?????????? 
????????"> 
<Statement example="???????? 
????????????????? 
???"/> 
</Definition> 
<SynsetRelations> 
<SynsetRelation target="zho-16- 
07029502-n" relType="has_synonym"> 
</SynsetRelation> 
</SynsetRelations> 
<MonolingualExternalRefs> 
<MonolingualExternalRef externalSys 
tem="SUMO" externalRefe 
rence="GeographicArea" rel 
Type="plus"/> 
</MonolingualExternalRefs> 
</Synset> 
 
3.3 SenseAxes 
SenseAxes is a bracketing element that groups 
together SenseAxis elements used for inter-
lingual correspondences. The SenseAxis element 
is a means to group synsets belonging to differ-
ent monolingual wordnets and sharing the same 
equivalent relation to Princeton WordNet 3.0. 
Required attributes are: 
 
z id: It is a unique identifier. 
z relType: It specifies the particular type 
of correspondence among synsets be-
longing to different resources. We use 
?eq_synonym? to represent equal 
synonym relation between Chinese 
Wordnet and Princeton WordNet. 
 
For instance, Chinese synset zho-16-06640901-n 
maps onto English synset eng-30-08567235-n by 
means of an eq_synonym relation. This will be 
represented as follows: 
 
<SenseAxes> 
<SenseAxis id="sa_zho16-eng30_5709" rel 
Type="eq_synonym"> 
<Target ID="zho-16-06640901-n"/> 
<Target ID="eng-30-08567235-n"/> 
</SenseAxis> 
</SenseAxes> 
4 An Example of CWN-LMF Format 
Take ?? zi-ran ?nature? as an example shown 
in Figure 3. ?? has six senses (some of them 
are abridged in the figure). Id attribute of the first 
sense is ??_1 and its synset is called ?zho-16-
03059301-n?. This encoding of synset stands for
??_1 with the unique ID 03059301 in Chinese 
WordNet version 1.6 and its part-of-speech is 
noun. Moreover, one can also learn that??_1 
has a synonym, ???_1 (zho-16-06653601-n). 
Meanwhile, this sense is also corresponded to 
IEEE SUMO. Finally, this compiled CWN-LMF 
version is pointed to Princeton WordNet 3.0, i.e. 
Chinese synset ?zho-16-03059301-n? maps onto 
English synset ?eng-30-11408559-n? by means 
of an eq_synonym relation.

5 Quantitative Analysis of CWN-LMF 
There are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses until 
December 2008 have been analyzed in CWN 1.6. 
So far the work on Chinese word distinction is 
still ongoing. It is expected that there are more 
analyzed results in the next released version.  
127
Among analyzed 25,961 senses, there are 268 
senses and 1,217 senses that belong to the first-
class and the second ?class basic words, respec-
tively. When part-of-speech is concerned, we can 
find most of these senses belong to nouns or 
verbs. There are 12,106 nouns, 10,454 nouns, 
806 adjectives and 1,605 adverbs in CWN 1.6 
We further distinguish semantic relations of 
CWN 1.6 and found that there are 3,328 syn-
onyms, 213 near synonyms, 246 hypernyms, 38 
hyponyms, 3 holonyms, 240 paranyms, 369 an-
tonyms and 432 variants, respectively.  
The IEEE SUMO is the only external system 
for monolingual references in CWN-LMF. There 
are 21,925 senses that were pointed to SUMO so 
far. In addition, there are 17,952 senses which 
shared the same equivalent relation to Princeton 
WordNet 3.0 in CWN-LMF. 
 
6 Application Scenarios 
The EU-7 project, KYOTO (Knowledge Yield-
ing Ontologies for Transition-based Organiza-
tion), wants to make knowledge sharable be-
tween communities of people, culture, language 
and computers, by assigning meaning to text and 
giving text to meaning (Vossen et al, 2008a; 
2008b). The goal of KYOTO is a system that 
allows people in communities to define the 
meaning of their words and terms in a shared 
Wiki platform so that it becomes anchored across 
languages and cultures but also so that a comput-
er can use this knowledge to detect knowledge 
and facts in text. 
KYOTO is a generic system offering know-
ledge transition and information across different 
target groups, transgressing linguistic, cultural 
and geographic boundaries. Initially developed 
for the environmental domain, KYOTO will be 
usable in any knowledge domain for mining, or-
ganizing, and distributing information on a glob-
al scale in both European and non-European lan-
guages.   
Whereas the current Wikipedia uses free text 
to share knowledge, KYOTO will represent this 
knowledge so that a computer can understand it. 
For example, the notion of environmental foot-
print will become defined in the same way in all 
these languages but also in such a way that the 
computer knows what information is necessary 
to calculate a footprint. With these definitions it 
will be possible to find information on footprints 
in documents, websites and reports so that users 
can directly ask the computer for actual informa-
tion in their environment, for instance, what is 
the footprint of their town, their region or their 
company. 
KYOTO?s principal components are an ontol-
ogy linked to WordNets in seven different lan-
guages (Basque, Chinese, Dutch, English, Italian, 
Japanese and Spanish). Due to different natures 
of languages, the different designed architectures 
were used to develop WordNets in theses lan-
guages. A unified framework is needed for in-
formation exchange. LMF is hence adopted as 
the framework at lexical semantic level in this 
project. The WordNet in these languages are 
compiled with designed WordNet-LMF format. 
CWN-LMF will also be involved and benefit for 
cross-language interpretabilities in semantic 
search field.  
7 Discussion 
Due to characters of Chinese language, there are 
some difficulties of encoding Chinese WordNet 
into Wordnet-LMF. A brief description is pre-
sented as follows.   
Chinese WordNet was designed for Chinese 
word sense distinction and its lexical semantic 
relationships. The designed architecture belongs 
to word-driven, not synset-driven.  So in CWN-
LMF, we encoded a sense as an individual synset 
and marked up the ?has_synonym? relation when 
senses belong to the same WordNet synset.  
In addition, how to define the basic concept of 
Chinese language is difficult. So far the basic 
word lists of the NEDO project were used as pre-
liminary basis. We need a further method to dis-
tinguish baseConcept attribute of word senses. 
8 Conclusions 
This study describes the design and implementa-
tion of how the Wordnet-LMF used to represent 
lexical semantics in Chinese WordNet. CWN-
LMF is benefit for data exchange among compu-
tational linguistic resources, and also promises a 
convenient uniformity for domain-specific appli-
cations such as KYOTO in cross-language se-
mantic search field.   
Future work is investigated with several direc-
tions. We are planning to release Chinese Word-
Net 1.6 using CWN-LMF format in an xml file, 
including a XML DTD in the following days. In 
addition, the use of this lingual resource for fur-
ther linguistic research is also under investigation.
