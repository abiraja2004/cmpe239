Abstract
This paper describes a distributional ap-
proach to the semantics of verb-particle
constructions (e.g. put up, make off ). We
report first on a framework for implement-
ing and evaluating such models. We then go
on to report on the implementation of some
techniques for using statistical models ac-
quired from corpus data to infer the mean-
ing of verb-particle constructions.
1 Introduction
The semantic representation of multiword expres-
sions (MWEs) has recently become the target of re-
newed attention, notably in the area of hand-written
grammar development (Sag et al, 2002; Villavicen-
cio and Copestake, 2002). Such items cause con-
siderable problems for any semantically-grounded
NLP application (including applications where se-
mantic information is implicit, such as information
retrieval) because their meaning is often not sim-
ply a function of the meaning of the constituent
parts. However, corpus-based or empirical NLP has
shown limited interest in the problem. While there
has been some work on statistical approaches to
the semantics of compositional compound nominals
(e.g. Lauer (1995), Barker and Szpakowicz (1998),
Rosario and Hearst (2001)), the more idiosyncratic
items have been largely ignored beyond attempts at
identification (Melamed, 1997; Lin, 1999; Schone and
Jurafsky, 2001). And yet the identification of non-
compositional phrases, while valuable in itself, would
by no means be the end of the matter. The unique
challenge posed by MWEs for empirical NLP is pre-
cisely that they do not fall cleanly into the binary
classes of compositional and non-compositional ex-
pressions, but populate a continuum between the two
extremes.
Part of the reason for the lack of interest by com-
putational linguists in the semantics of MWEs is that
there is no established gold standard data from which
to construct or evaluate models. Evaluation to date has
tended to be fairly ad hoc. Another key problem is the
lack of any firm empirical foundations for the notion
of compositionality. Given this background, this pa-
per has two aims. The first is to put the treatment of
non-compositionality in corpus-based NLP on a firm
empirical footing. As such it describes the develop-
ment of a resource for implementing and evaluating
statistical models of MWE meaning, based on non-
expert human judgements. The second is to demon-
strate the usefulness of such approaches by imple-
menting and evaluating a handful of approaches.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
We outline the linguistic foundations of this research
in Section 2 before describing the process of resource
building in Section 3. Section 4 summarises previ-
ous work on the subject and Section 5 details our pro-
posed models of compositionality. Section 6 lays out
the evaluation of those models over the gold standard
data, and we conclude the paper in Section 7.
2 Verb Particle Constructions
We selected the English verb-particle construction as
our test case MWE in this paper. Verb-particle con-
structions (hereafter referred to as VPCs) consist of a
head verb and one or more obligatory particles, in the
form of intransitive prepositions (e.g. hand in), ad-
jectives (e.g. cut short) or verbs (e.g. let go) . Here,
we focus exclusively on prepositional particles due to
their high productivity and variable compositionality.
Examples of prepositional VPCs are put up, finish up,
gun down and make out as used in the following sen-
tences:
(1) Peter put the picture up
(2) Susan finished up her paper
(3) Philip gunned down the intruder
(4) Barbara and Simon made out
VPCs cause significant problems for NLP sys-
tems. Semantically, they often cannot be understood
through the simple composition of their independent
parts. Compare, for example, sentences (1) and (4).
In (1), the meaning seems to be that Peter put the pic-
ture somewhere and that as a consequence the picture
was up. That is, the verb and the particle make in-
dependent contributions to the sentence. A (partial)
Parsons-style semantic analysis of this might be as
follows:
put(e1, x, y) ? peter(x) ? picture(y) ? up(e1, y)
Sentence (4), on the other hand requires a rather dif-
ferent analysis. Neither Barbara nor Simon can be
said to have made or to be out. The semantic anal-
ysis we would want then might be something like the
following:
make out(e1, e2) ? and(e2, x, y) ? barbara(x) ? simon(y)
How are we to identify whether the first or the second
kind of semantic representation is appropriate for any
given item? If we look at the other two sentences we
can see that the problem is even more complicated.
In (2) it is the case that the paper is finished, but it
would be hard to claim that anything or anyone is up.
Only the verb then seems to be contributing its sim-
plex meaning, and the semantic analysis is (roughly):
finish(e1, x, y) ? susan(x) ? paper(y)
In (3), by contrast, it is the particle that contributes its
simplex meaning and not the verb. As a consequence
of Philip?s action the intruder is down, but since there
is no simplex verb to gun, we would not say that any-
one gunned or was gunned The semantic analysis is
consequently as follows:
gun down(e1, x, y) ? philip(x) ? intruder(y) ? down(e1, y)
In the linguistic literature, the semantics of VPCs
is frequently viewed in rather more complicated terms
than we are suggesting here, with particles often seen
as making significant construction-specific contribu-
tions in terms of aspect (e.g. Brinton (1985)). How-
ever no such existing linguistic account is completely
robust, and for practical NLP purposes we are forced
to adopt a rather straightforward definition of compo-
sitionality as meaning that the overall semantics of the
MWE can be composed from the simplex semantics
of its parts, as described (explicitly or implicitly) in a
finite lexicon.
3 Building the Resource
Rather than attempting to model compositionality by
anchoring word semantics to a given lexicon, our ap-
proach in this work is to defer to an empirical refer-
ence based on human judgements. We define MWE
compositionality to be an entailment relationship be-
tween the whole and its various parts, and solicit en-
tailment judgements based on a handful of example
sentences.
Entailment is conventionally defined for logical
propositions, where a proposition P entails a proposi-
tion Q iff there is no conceivable state of affairs that
could make P true and Q false. This can be gener-
alised to refer to the relationship between two verbs
V1 and V2 that holds when the sentence Someone V1s
entails the sentence Someone V2s (see, e.g., the treat-
ment of verbs in the WordNet hierarchy (Miller et al,
1990)). According to this generalisation we would
then say that the verb run entails the verb move be-
cause the sentence He runs entails the sentence He
moves. The same idea can be generalised to the rela-
tionship between simplex verbs (e.g. walk) and VPCs
(e.g. walk off ). For example, sentence (1) can be said
to entail that Peter put the picture somewhere and so
we can say that put up entails put. The same might be
said of finish up and finish in (2). However, (3) and
(4) produce a rather different result. (4) does not en-
tail that Simon and Barbara made something, and (3)
cannot entail that Philip gunned the intruder because
there is no simplex verb to gun. This is a very useful
way of testing whether the simplex verb contributes to
the meaning of the construction.
We can approach the relationship between VPCs
and particles in this same way. For (1), while it is
not true that Peter was up, it is true that The picture
was up. We can therefore say that the VPC entails the
particle here. For (2), it is not true that either Susan
or the paper were up, and the VPC therefore does not
entail the particle. In the case of (3), while it is not
true that Philip was down it is true that The intruder
was down, and the VPC therefore entails the particle.
Finally, for (4), it is not true that Barbara and Simon
were out, and the VPC therefore does not entail the
particle.
We make the assumption that these relationships
between the component words of the VPC and the
whole are intuitive to non-experts, and aim to use
their ?entailment? judgements accordingly. This
use of entailment in exploring the semantics of
verb and preposition combinations was first pro-
posed by Hawkins (2000), and applied to VPCs by
Lohse et al (in preparation).
3.1 Experimental Materials
In an attempt to normalise the annotators? entailment
judgements, we decided upon an experimental setup
where the subject is, for each VPC type, presented
with a fixed selection of sentential contexts for that
VPC. So as to avoid introducing any bias into the
experiment through artificially-generated sentences,
we chose to extract the sentences from naturally-
occurring text, namely the written component of the
British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard (2000)).
Extraction of the VPCs was based on the method
of Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002). First, we used a
POS tagger and chunker (both built using fnTBL 1.0
(Ngai and Florian, 2001)) to (re)tag the BNC. This al-
lowed us to extract VPC tokens through use of: (a)
the particle POS in the POS tagged output, for each
instance of which we simply then look for the right-
most verb within a fixed window to the left of the
particle, and (b) the particle chunk tag in the chunker
output, where we similarly locate the rightmost verb
associated with each particle chunk occurrence. Fi-
nally, we ran a stochastic chunk-based grammar over
the chunker output to extend extraction coverage to
include mistagged particles and also more reliably de-
termine the valence of the VPC. The token output of
these three methods was amalgamated by weighted
voting.
The above method extracted 461 distinct VPC types
occurring at least 50 times, attested in a total of
110,199 sentences. After partitioning the sentence
data by type, we randomly selected 5 sentences for
each VPC type. We then randomly selected 40 VPC
types (with 5 sentences each) to use in the entailment
experiment. That is, all results described in this paper
are over 40 VPC types.
3.2 Participants
28 participants took part in our initial experiment.
They were all native speakers of English, recruited
by advertisements posted to newsgroups and mailing
lists.
3.3 Experimental Method
Each participant was presented with 40 sets of 5 sen-
tences, where each of the five sentences contained a
particular VPC. The VPC in question was indicated at
the top of the screen, and they were asked two ques-
tions: (1) whether the VPC implies the verb, and (2)
whether the VPC implies the particle. If the VPC
was round up, e.g., the subject would be asked ?Does
round up imply round?? and ?Does round up im-
ply up??, respectively. They were given the option of
three responses: ?Yes?, ?No? or ?Don?t Know?. Once
they had indicated their answer and pressed next, they
advanced to the next VPC and set of 5 sentences. They
were unable to move on until a choice had been indi-
cated.
As with any corpus-based approach to lexical se-
mantics, our study of VPCs is hampered by poly-
semy, e.g. carry outTRANSin the execute and transport
out (from a location) senses.1 Rather than intervene
to customise example sentences to a prescribed sense,
we accepted whatever composition of senses random
sampling produced. Participants were advised that if
they felt more that one meaning was present in the set
of five sentences, they should base their decision on
the sense that had the greatest number of occurrences
in the set.
1The effects of polysemy were compounded by not having any
reliable method for determining valence. We consider that sim-
ply partitioning VPC items into intransitive and transitive usages
would reduce polysemy significantly.

Table 2: Summary of judgements for all VPCs
The experiment was conducted remotely over the
Web, using the experimental software package Web-
Exp (Corley et al, 2000). Experimental sessions
lasted approximately 20 minutes and were self-paced.
The order in which the forty sets of sentences were
presented was randomised by the software.
3.4 Annotator agreement
We performed a pairwise analysis of the agreement
between our 28 participants. The overall mean agree-
ment was .655, with a kappa (?) score (Carletta, 1996)
of .329. An initial analysis showed that two partic-
ipants strongly disagreed with the other, achieving a
mean pairwise ? score of less than .1. We decided
therefore to remove these from the set before pro-
ceeding. The overall results for the remaining 26 par-
ticipants can be seen in Table 2. The ? score over
these 26 participants (.376) is classed as fair (0.2?
0.4) and approaching moderate (0.4?0.6) according to
Altman (1991).
As mentioned above, a major problem with lexi-
cal semantic studies is that items tend to occur with
more than one meaning. In order to test the effects of
polysemy in the example sentences on inter-annotator
agreement, we analysed the agreement obtained over
those VPCs which have only one meaning accord-
ing to WordNet (Miller et al, 1990). There was a
total of 14 such items, giving 28 entailment judge-
ments (one for the verb and one for the particle in
each item). For these items, mean agreement and the
? score were .700 and .387, respectively. These are
only very slightly higher than the overall scores, sug-
gesting, although by no means proving, that polysemy
was not a significant confounding factor.
The results for each VPC type can be seen in Ta-
ble 1, broken down into the verb and particle entail-
ment judgements and based on the 26 participants. We
took two approaches to deriving a single judgement
for each test. First, we took the majority judgement
to be the correct one (majority). Second, we identi-
fied the participant who achieved the highest overall ?
score with the other participants, and took their judge-
ments to be correct (centroid annotator). Both sets
of results will be referred to in evaluating our models.
It is interesting to look at the way in which the re-
sults for component entailment are distributed across
the VPCs. According to the majority view, there are
21 fully-compositional items, 10 items where neither
the verb nor the particle is entailed, 9 items where only
the particle is entailed, and 0 items where the verb
alone is entailed. According to the judgements of the
centroid annotator, there are 10 fully-compositional
items, 12 items where neither the verb nor the parti-
cle is entailed, 15 where only the verb is entailed, and
3 where only the particle is entailed. It is surprising
to notice that the majority view holds there to be no
items in which the verb alone is contributing mean-
ing. It could be the case that items where only the
verb contributes meaning are rare, or that they are not
represented in our dataset. Another possible, and to
our minds more likely, conclusion is that the contribu-
tion of the head verb strongly affects the way in which
participants view the whole item. Thus if a verb is
considered to be contributing simplex semantics, the
participant is likely to assume that the VPC is com-
pletely compositional, and conversely if a verb is con-
sidered to not be contributing simplex semantics, the
participant is more likely to assume the VPC to be
non-compositional.
4 Related Work
We devote this section to a description of statistical
NLP work on the non-compositionality of MWEs.
Perhaps the singularly most influential work on
MWE non-compositionality is that of Lin (1999). We
describe Lin?s method in some detail here as it forms
the basis of one of the methods tested in this re-
search. Lin?s method is based on the premise that non-
compositional items have markedly different distribu-
tional characteristics to expressions derived through
synonym substitution over the original word compo-
sition. Lin took his multiword items from a colloca-
tion database (Lin, 1998b). For each collocation, he
substituted each of the component words with a word
with a similar meaning. The list of similar meanings
was obtained by taking the 10 most similar words ac-
cording to a corpus-derived thesaurus, the construc-
tion of which is described in Lin (1998a). The mutual
information value was then found for each item pro-
duced by this substitution by taking a collocation to
consist of three events: the type of dependency rela-
tionship, the head lexical item, and the modifier. A
phrase ? was then said to be non-compositional iff
there exists no phrase ? where: (a) ? can be pro-
duced by substitution of the components of ? as de-
scribed above, and (b) there is an overlap between
the 95% confidence interval of the mutual informa-
tion values of ? and ?. These judgements were eval-
uated by comparison with a dictionary of idioms. If
an item was in the dictionary then it was said to be
non-compositional. Scores of 15.7% for precision and
13.7% for recall are reported.
There are, to our minds, significant problems with
the underlying assumptions of Lin?s method. The
theoretical basis of the technique is that composi-
tional items should have a similar distribution to items
formed by replacing components words with seman-
tically similar ones. The idea presumably is that if an
item is the result of the free combination of words, or
a fully productive lexical rule, then word-substituted
variants should be distributed similarly. This seems a
reasonable basis for modelling productivity but not
compositionality, as Lin claims. There are many ex-
amples in natural language of phrases that are not at
all productive but are still compositional (e.g. frying
pan); we term the process by which these expressions
arise institutionalisation . Similar work to Lin?s has
been done in the area of collocation extraction (e.g.
Pearce (2002)), to pick up on this alternate concept of
institutionalisation.
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employed Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (LSA, Deerwester et al (1990)) in an
effort to improve on existing techniques for extract-
ing MWEs from corpora. One property they try and
pick up on in doing so is non-compositionality. They
measure the cosine between the vector representation
for the candidate MWE and a weighted vector sum
of its component words, suggesting that a small co-
sine would indicate compositionality. They evaluate
this by comparing the extracted items with those listed
in existing dictionaries, and report that it offers no
improvement in extracting MWEs over existing tech-
niques. The assumption that non-compositionality is
requisite for the presence of a MWE in a dictionary,
while interesting, is not well-founded, and hence it
does not seem to us that the poor results reflect a fail-
ure of the LSA approach in measuring compositional-
ity.
Bannard (2002) used a combination of hand-built
thesauri and corpus statistics to explore the compo-
sitionality of VPCs. The task was to predict whether
the verb and/or the particle were contributing meaning
to a given item, using statistical analysis of a set of
VPCs extracted from the Wall Street Journal section
of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993). Two tech-
niques were used. The first of these loosely followed
Lin in measuring the extent to which the component
verb or particle of any VPC could be replaced with
items of a similar semantic class to form a corpus-
attested VPC; WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) was used
as the source for verb substitution candidates, and a
hand-build semantic taxonomy for particles. The sec-
ond technique explored the semantic similarity of a
VPC to its component verb by comparing their subcat-
egorisation preferences, assuming that semantic sim-
ilarity between a VPC and its component verb indi-
cates compositionality. Poor results were put down
to data-sparseness, and the lexical resources not being
well suited to the task. We use a larger corpus and an
automatically-derived thesaurus for the research de-
scribed in this paper, with the hope of overcoming
these problems.
McCarthy et al (2003) carry out research close in
spirit to that described here, in taking VPC tokens
automatically extracted from the BNC and using an
automatically acquired thesaurus to classify their rel-
ative compositionality. One significant divergence
from our research is that they consider composition-
ality to be an indivisible property of the overall VPC,
and not the individual parts. Gold-standard data was
generated by asking human annotators to describe the
compositionality of a given VPC according to a 11-
point scale, based upon which the VPCs were ranked
in order of compositionality. Similarly to this re-
search, McCarthy et al in part used the similarity
measure of Lin (1998a) to model compositionality,
e.g., in taking the top N similar words to each VPC
and looking at overlap with the top N similar words to
the head verb. They also examine the use of statistical
tests such as mutual information in modelling com-
positionality, and find the similarity-based methods to
correlate more highly with the human judgements.
Baldwin et al (2003) use LSA as a technique for
analysing the compositionality (or decomposabil-
ity) of a given MWE. LSA is suggested to be
a construction-inspecific test for compositionality,
which is illustrated by testing its effectivity over both
English noun-noun compounds and VPCs. Baldwin
et al used LSA to calculate the distributional similar-
ity between an MWE and its head word, and demon-
strate a correlation between similarity and composi-
tionality (modelled in terms of endocentricity) by way
of items with higher similarity being more composi-
tional. They do not go as far as to classify MWEs as
being compositional or non-compositional, however.
5 Building a classifier
Having created our gold-standard data, we imple-
mented some statistical techniques for automatic anal-
ysis. In this, we use the VPC tokens with sentential
contexts extracted from the BNC as reported in Sec-
tion 3, i.e. a superset of the data used to annotate the
VPCs. We mapped the gold-standard data onto four
binary (yes/no) classification tasks over VPC items:
TASK 1: The item is completely compositional.
TASK 2: The item includes at least one item that is
compositional.
TASK 3: The verb in the item contributes its simplex
meaning.
TASK 4: The particle in the item contributes its sim-
plex meaning.
Note the partial conditional chaining between these
tests, e.g. an item for which the verb and particle con-
tribute their simplex meaning (i.e. positive exemplars
for TASKS 3 and 4) is completely compositional (i.e.
a positive exemplar for TASK 1).
The following sections describe four methods for
modelling VPC compositionality, each of which is
tested over the 4 individual compositionality classi-
fication tasks. The results for each method are given
in Table 4, in which the baseline for each task is the
score obtained when we assign the most frequent label
to all items. Each method is evaluated in terms of pre-
cision (Prec), Recall (Rec) and F-score (? = 1, FB1),
and all values which exceed the baseline are indicated
in boldface.
5.1 Method 1
We decided to gain a sense of the start-of-the-art on
the task by reimplementing the technique described
in Lin (1999) over VPCs. In our implementation we
replaced Lin?s collocations with our VPCs, treating
the relationship between a verb and a particle as a
kind of grammatical relation. In addition to the binary
compositional/non-compositional judgement that Lin
offers (which seems to be equivalent to TASK 1), we
tested the method over the other three tasks. Ac-
knowledging, as we must, that items can be partially
compositional (i.e. have one component item con-
tributing a conventional meaning), it would seem to
be the case, according to the assumptions made by
the technique, that the substitutability of each item
will give us some insight into its semantic contribu-
tion. The thesaurus used by Lin has been generously
made available online. However this is not adequate
for our purposes since it includes only verbs, nouns
and adjectives/adverbs. We therefore replicated the
approach described in Lin (1998a) to build the the-
saurus, using BNC data and including prepositions.
5.2 Method 2
Method 2 is very similar to Method 1, except that
instead of using a thesaurus based on Lin?s method,
we took a knowledge-free approach to obtaining syn-
onyms. Our technique is very similar to the approach
taken to building a ?context space? by Schu?tze (1998).
We measured the frequency of co-occurrence of our
target words (the 20,000 most frequent words, includ-
ing all of our VPCs2 and all of their component verbs
and prepositions) with a set of 1000 ?content-bearing?
words (we used the 51st to the 1050th most frequent
words, the 50 most frequent being taken to have ex-
tremely low infomation content). A target word was
said to co-occur with a content word if that content
word occurred within a window of 5 words to either
side of it. These co-occurrence figures were stored as
feature vectors. In order to overcome data sparseness,
we used techniques borrowed from Latent Seman-
tic Indexing (LSI, Deerwester et al (1990)). LSI is
an information retrieval technique based on Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), and works by project-
ing a term-document matrix onto a lower-dimensional
subspace, in which relationships might more easily be

observed between terms which are related but do not
co-occur. We used this technique to reduce the feature
space for our target words from 1000 to 100, allow-
ing relations to be discovered between target words
even if there is not direct match between their context
words. We used the various tools in the GTP software
package, created at the University of Tennessee3 to
build these matrices from the co-occurrence data, and
to perform SVD analysis.
We calculated the similarity between two terms by
finding the cosine of the angle between their vec-
tors. We performed a pairwise comparison between
all verbs and all particles. For each term we then
sorted all of the other items of the same part-of-speech
in descending order of similarity, which gave us the
thesaurus for use in substitution. As with the Lin
method, we performed substitutions by taking the 10
most similar items for the head verb and particle of
each VPC.
5.3 Method 3
We noted in Section 4 that a significant problem
with the substitution approach is that it is sensitive to
institutionalisation rather than non-compositionality.
Method 3 attempts to adapt substitution to more ac-
curately reflect non-compositionality by removing the
assumption that an item formed by substitution should
have the same distributional characteristics as the
original item. Rather than basing the composition-
ality judgement on the relative mutual information
scores of the original items and the items resulting
from substitution, we instead base it on the corpus-
based semantic similarity between the original ex-
pression and word-substituted derivative expressions.
The same method of substitution is used, with each
component being replaced by each of its 10 nearest
neighbours according to the knowledge-free similar-
ity measure described above. We judge a VPC item
to be compositional if an expression formed by sub-
stitution occurs among the nearest 100 verb-particle
items to the original, and failing this, we judge it to be
non-compositional. We experimented with a number
of cut-off points for identifying semantically similar
items, and found that a value of 100 gave the best re-
sults.
5.4 Method 4
While Method 3 softens the reliance upon productiv-
ity as a test for compositionality, it still confuses insti-

Table 4: Results for the four methods over the different compositionality classification tasks
tutionalisation with non-compositionality somewhat
in its reliance upon substitution. We now suggest an-
other technique which we claim is based on sounder
principles. The underlying intuition is that identify-
ing the degree of semantic similarity between a VPC
and its component verb and/or particle will indicate
whether that component part contributes independent
semantics. This is similar to the assumption made
in Schone and Jurafsky (2001), except that we make
a distinction between the contribution of the different
component parts. We again used the knowledge-free
semantic similarity measure. We performed a pair-
wise comparison of all VPCs with all verbs and all
particles, obtaining cosine similarity scores for each
pair.
In order to measure the usefulness of this score,
we performed a logistic regression of the similarity
scores and the human judgements as to whether the
given verb or particle is entailed by the VPC. We did
this for the majority human judgements, and also the
centroid annotator scores. We also did the same us-
ing the majority scores but rejecting those items on
which there was less than 60% agreement. In ad-
dition to performing a regression for all items (All),
we also performed a regression for only those items
which have only one meaning according to WordNet
(Monosemous). The results for all of these are shown
in Table 3. The figures shown are chi-squared scores,
with their associated significance values. We observed
significant correlations for a number of the regres-
sions (notably all items vs. the centroid annotator, and
monosemous items vs. 60% agreement). While the
results are far from stable, such variation is perhaps to
be expected on a test like this since the nature of con-
text space models means that rogue items sometimes
get extremely high similarity scores, and we are per-
forming the regression over only 40 VPCs (80 VPC-
component pairs).
In order to build a classifier for making composi-
tionality decisions, we again used a neighbour-based
approach with a cut-off. We said that a verb was
contributing meaning to a VPC if it occurred in the
20 most similar items to the VPC. For particles, we
said that the item was contributing meaning if it was
among the 10 nearest neighbours. We tried out a range
of different cut-offs for each item and found that these
gave the best results.
6 Results
The results in Table 4 show that on all tasks (for the
majority-view based data and three out of four for the
centroid data), at least one of the four statistical meth-
ods offers an improvement in precision over the base-
line, and that there is an improvement in F-score for
TASK 1 on both sets of data. There are swings in the
relative scores obtained over the majority as compared
to centroid annotator data for a given task. In terms
of relative performance, the semantic similarity based
approach of Methods 3 and 4 outperform the distribu-
tion based approach of Methods 1 and 2 in terms of
F-score, on 6 of the 8 sets of results reported.
In order to get a reliable sense for how good these
scores are, we compare them with the level of agree-
ment across human judges. We calculated pairwise
agreement across all participants on the four classifi-
cation tasks, resulting in the figures given in Table 4.
These agreement scores give us an upper bound for
classification accuracy on each task, from which it is
possible to benchmark the classification accuracy of
the classifiers on that same task. On TASK 1, three of
the four classifiers achieved a classification accuracy
of .575. On TASK 2, the highest-performing classi-
fier (Method 4), achieved a classification accuracy of
.725. On TASK 3, Method 2 achieved the highest clas-
sification accuracy at .600, and on TASK 4, Method 4
achieved a classification accuracy of .675. We can see
then that the best classifiers perform only marginally
below the upper bound on at least two of the tasks.
While these results may appear at first glance to be
less than conclusive, we must bear in mind that we are
working with limited amounts of data and relatively
simplistic models of a cognitively intensive task. We
interpret them as very positive indicators of the via-
bility of using empirical methods to analyse VPC se-
mantics.
7 Conclusion
This paper has described the implementation and eval-
uation of four corpus-based approaches to the seman-
tics of verb-particle constructions. We created a set of
gold-standard data, based on non-expert judgements
acquired via a web-based experiment. We then imple-
mented four different techniques and showed that they
offer a significant improvement over a naive approach.
