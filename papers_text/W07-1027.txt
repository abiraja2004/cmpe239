Abstract
This paper proposes a machine learning ap-
proach to the task of assigning the inter-
national standard on classification of dis-
eases ICD-9-CM codes to clinical records.
By treating the task as a text categorisa-
tion problem, a classification system was
built which explores a variety of features in-
cluding negation, different strategies of mea-
suring gloss overlaps between the content
of clinical records and ICD-9-CM code de-
scriptions together with expansion of the
glosses from the ICD-9-CM hierarchy. The
best classifier achieved an overall F1 value
of 88.2 on a data set of 978 free text clinical
records, and was better than the performance
of two out of three human annotators.
1 Introduction
Despite the rapid progress on text categorisation in
the newswire domain, assigning meaningful labels
to clinical notes has only recently emerged as a topic
for computational linguists although health infor-
matics researchers have been working on the prob-
lem for over 10 years. This paper describes con-
structing classifiers for the Computational Medicine
Center?s 2007 Medical Natural Language Process-
ing Challenge which aims to assign ICD-9-CM
codes to free text radiology reports. (Computational
Medicine Center, 2007) It addresses the difficulties
of medical text categorisation tasks by incorporating
medical negations, term variations, and clues from
hierarchy of medical ontologies as additional fea-
tures.
2 The task of assigning ICD-9-CM codes
The corpus used in this study is a collection of
radiology reports from the Cincinnati Children?s
Hospital Medical Center, Department of Radiol-
ogy. (Computational Medicine Center, 2007) The
data set is divided into a training set and a test set.
The training set consists of 978 records and the test
set consists of 976 records and 45 ICD-9-CM code.
The task was considered as a multi-label text cate-
gorisation problem. For each code found in the cor-
pus, we created a separate classifier which makes
binary ?Yes? or ?No? decisions for the target code
of a clinical record. Maximum Entropy Modeling
(MaxEnt) (Berger et al, 1996) and Support Vector
Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) were used to build
the classifiers in our solution.
3 Features
A variety of features were developed to represent
what we believed were the important determiners of
the ICD-9-CM codes.
Bag-of-words (BOW) features: include only un-
igrams and bigrams in the text.
Negation features: were used in the classification
system to capture the terms that are negated or un-
certain, for example ?pneumonia? vs ?no evidence
of pneumonia?. We created a negation-finding sys-
tem which uses an algorithm similar to (Chapman
et al, 2001) to identify the negation phrase and the
scope of negations.
Gloss matching feature: The ICD-9-CM pro-
vides detailed text definition for each code. This sec-
tion explores different strategies for measuring gloss

matchings between the content of a clinical record
and the definition of an ICD-9-CM code.
Feature engineering: In experiments with a uni-
form set of feature types for all ICD-9-CM codes,
we noticed that different codes tend to have a pref-
erence for different combinations of feature types.
Therefore, different combinations of feature types
for each individual code were used. The intuition
is to explore different combination of feature types
quickly instead of doing further feature selection
procedures. The system trained on the best combina-
tion of feature types are reported as the final results
for the target code.
Low frequency codes modeling: A rule-based
system was also used to model low frequency ICD-
9-CM codes which have only one occurrence in the
corpus, or have achieved F1 value of 0.0 by machine
learning. The system assigns a low frequent code to
a clinical record if the content of the record matches
the words of the code definition.
4 Result
Table 1 shows the experiment results. Since the
gold-standard annotation of the test dataset has not
been released so far, the experiment was done on the
978 documents training dataset using 10-fold cross-
validation. 1 The baseline system S0 was created
using only BOW features. Adding negation features
gives S1 an improvement of 1.9% on F1 score. The
gloss matching features gives a further increase of
1.7% on F1 score.

CM code assignment task, this section evaluates the

5 Conclusion
This paper presents an approach to the problem
of assigning ICD-9-CM codes to free text medical
records. We created a classification system which
consists of multiple machine-learned classifiers on
high-frequency codes, and a rule-based modeling
module of low-frequency codes. By incorporating
negations and a variety of gloss matching features,
we successfully outperformed the baseline with only
bag-of-words features by 7.1% on F1 value. The
best reported score is also considered as compara-
ble to the performance of the best human annotator.
We also consider the way our system selected the
best combination of feature types for each individ-
ual ICD-9-CM code has a major contribution to the
classification task of clinical records.
