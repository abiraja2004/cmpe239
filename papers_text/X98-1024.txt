Automatic Text Summarization was added as a 
major research thrust of the TIPSTER program 
during TIPSTER Phase III, 1996-1998. It is a 
natural extension of the previously supported 
research efforts in Information Extraction (IE) 
and Information Retrieval (IR). There is 
considerable interest in automatically producing 
summaries due, in large part, to the growth of the 
Internet and the World Wide Web. The 
TIPSTER program sponsored seven research 
efforts into text summarization, all with different 
approaches tothe problem. 
? Carnegie Group lnc and Carnegie Mellon 
University teamed up to investigate a 
technique called "Maximal Marginal 
Relevance" or MMR, which produces 
summaries of documents by identifying key 
relevant, non-redundant i formation found 
within the document, intended primarily for 
very long documents. 
? Cornell University and SabIR Research, 
Inc. used the document ranking and passage 
retrieval capabilities of the SMART IR 
engine to effectively identify relevant 
related passages in a document. 
? GE Research & Development identified 
the discourse macro structure for each 
document and selected the passages from 
each component that scored well using both 
content and contextual c ues. 
? New Mexico State University also used 
information about he document structure 
combined with part of speech and proper 
name recognition to weight and select 
sentences to be included in their summaries. 
? Textwise LLC primarily concentrated on
summaries of multiple documents. They 
assigned subject field coding of documents 
as an initial indicator of document content 
and identified the most relevant paragraphs, 
combining statistical information about erm 
frequency with linguistic information. 
? University of Pennsylvania used co- 
reference resolution as the basis for their 
summaries, finding information within a 
document that is naturally linked together by 
referring to the same individual, 
organization, orevent and extracting that 
related information to generate a summary. 
USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) 
used a multi-faceted approach, including the 
optimal position of a sentence within a text, 
which varies based on text type, and 
building thematic representations of texts 
based on external ontologies. 
Each of the systems is described in detail 
elsewhere in the proceedings. 
In coordination with the various research 
efforts, DARPA sponsored an evaluation of text 
summarization systems. This evaluation was 
conducted in two phases. In September 1997, a 
dry-run was held to validate the evaluation 
methodology and establish a baseline for 
performance. Participation i the dry-run was 
limited to TIPSTER researchers only. A formal 
evaluation was conducted inMay 1998 and was 
open to all interested parties. 
The summaries can be characterized and 
evaluated by many features, including: 
? Coverage - m summary can cover a 
single document or a group of related 
documents. 
? Focus - A generic summary captures 
the main theme(s) of a document, 
whereas auser-directed summary is
geared towards aparticular topic of 
interest indicated by the user. 
? h~tent - An indicative summary 
provides aquick overview of the 
content of the full text, but is not 
intended to serve as a substitute. An 
informative summary should capture 
enough relevant information to be a 
replacement for the full text document. 
The evaluation consisted of four tasks 
designed to assess performance ofautomatic 
summaries used in real world tasks and to 
leverage off of previous evaluations in IR and IE, 
the Text REtrieval Conferences and Message 
Understanding Conferences, respectively. It
primarily addressed indicative summa_izies of
single documents.

In the adhoc task, analysts read the output of 
the summarization systems intermixed with full 
text and baseline (lead sentence) summaries and 
assessed the relevance of each text presented to 
them with respect o a given topic (each system 
summary was a user-directed summary). 
In the categorization task, analysts reviewed 
a different set of summaries, full text and 
baselines and had to determine which topic, 
among a set of five related topics, best 
represented the theme of the text (each summary 
was a generic summary). 
For the question-and-answer task, each user- 
directed summary was evaluated to determine if
it included the answers to 4-5 questions 
considered essential for a document to be 
relevant o a given topic. The percentage of 
questions answered was compared to that of a 
full text document. A summary that successfully 
captures all of the relevant concepts in a 
document could be considered a good 
informative summary of that document. 
The acceptability task simply asked the 
analysts to read each of 30 summaries and the 
corresponding full text and determine if the 
summary was a good summary for the document. 
This task was not conducted uring the dry-run. 
For the adhoc and categorization tasks, 
participants submitted two summaries. One was 
restricted to 10% of the length of the document, 
the other could vary in length and was intended 
to capture the best summary a system could 
produce. The question-and-answer and 
acceptability tasks used only these best 
summaries. 
TREC documents and relevance data were 
used for all tasks. This provided a good basis for 
the initial evaluations, however future 
evaluations should evolve beyond single 
document summarization of newspaper-style 
text. 
The formal evaluation was held in the spring 
of 1998 and in addition to the seven TIPSTER 
contractors included participants from around the 
world: 
* British Telecomm's ProSum 
? Center for Information Research 
(Russia) 
? Intelligent Algorithm's Infogist 
? IBM 'Thomas J. Watson Research 
? Lexis-Nexis 
? National Taiwan University 
? SRA International 
? University of Massachusetts Center for 
Intelligent Information Retrieval 
? University of Surrey 
There was not a large difference in 
performance between the various systems in 
either evaluation, however the results do show 
some encouraging trends. The analysts were 
able to process the best summaries more quickly 
than the full text without a significant loss in 
accuracy, and they preferred reading documents 
that were shorter in length than the typical long 
full text articles. The results from the dry-run 
were discussed uring the TIPSTER meeting in 
October 1997 and are documented in \[Firmin 
and Chrzanowski 1998\]. The results of the 
formal evaluation were discussed in May 1998 
and are documented in \[Mani et al, 1998\]. 
Interest in summarization continues to grow. 
Two frequently mentioned applications include 
summarization of the results of an IR query (e.g. 
from Altavista or Infoseek) or combining 
summarization with a traditional text processing 
application such as Microsoft Word. Research 
efforts are moving towards summarization across 
documents and summarization i languages 
other than English. As this research continues 
and more applications come on the market, it 
will be useful to have a benchmark against which 
to evaluate the utility of the systems. The 
DARPA evaluation was a first step in that 
direction. 
The dry-run and formal evaluations were 
conducted by the Department of Defense, 
SPAWAR Systems Center and The MITRE 
Corp. under DARPA sponsorship through the 
TIPSTER program.
