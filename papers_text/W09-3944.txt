Abstract
This paper examines the resolution of the
second person English pronoun you in
multi-party dialogue. Following previous
work, we attempt to classify instances as
generic or referential, and in the latter case
identify the singular or plural addressee.
We show that accuracy and robustness can
be improved by use of simple lexical fea-
tures, capturing the intuition that different
uses and addressees are associated with
different vocabularies; and we show that
there is an advantage to treating referen-
tiality and addressee identification as sep-
arate (but connected) problems.
1 Introduction
Resolving second-person references in dialogue is
far from trivial. Firstly, there is the referentiality
problem: while we generally conceive of the word
you1 as a deictic addressee-referring pronoun, it
is often used in non-referential ways, including as
a discourse marker (1) and with a generic sense
(2). Secondly, there is the reference problem: in
addressee-referring cases, we need to know who
the addressee is. In two-person dialogue, this is
not so difficult; but in multi-party dialogue, the ad-
dressee could in principle be any one of the other
participants (3), or any group of more than one (4):
(1) It?s not just, you know, noises like something
hitting.
(2) Often, you need to know specific button
sequences to get certain functionalities done.
(3) I think it?s good. You?ve done a good review.
(4) I don?t know if you guys have any questions.
1We include your, yours, yourself, yourselves.
This paper extends previous work (Gupta et al,
2007; Frampton et al, 2009) in attempting to au-
tomatically treat both problems: detecting refer-
ential uses, and resolving their (addressee) refer-
ence. We find that accuracy can be improved by
the use of lexical features; we also give the first
results for treating both problems simultaneously,
and find that there is an advantage to treating them
as separate (but connected) problems via cascaded
classifiers, rather than as a single joint problem.
2 Related Work
Gupta et al (2007) examined the referentiality
problem, distinguishing generic from referential
uses in multi-party dialogue; they found that 47%
of uses were generic and achieved a classification
accuracy of 75%, using various discourse features
and discriminative classifiers (support vector ma-
chines and conditional random fields). They at-
tempted the reference-resolution problem, using
only discourse (non-visual) features, but accuracy
was low (47%).
Addressee identification in general (i.e. in-
dependent of the presence of you) has been ap-
proached in various ways. Traum (2004) gives
a rule-based algorithm based on discourse struc-
ture; van Turnhout et al (2005) used facial ori-
entation as well as utterance features; and more
recently Jovanovic (2006; 2007) combined dis-
course and gaze direction features using Bayesian
networks, achieving 77% accuracy on a portion of
the AMI Meeting Corpus (McCowan et al, 2005)
of 4-person dialogues.
In recent work, therefore, Frampton et al
(2009) extended Gupta et al?s method to in-
clude multi-modal features including gaze direc-
tion, again using Bayesian networks on the AMI
corpus. This gave a small improvement on the ref-
306
erentiality problem (achieving 79% accuracy), and
a large improvement on the reference-resolution
task (77% accuracy distinguishing singular uses
from plural, and 80% resolving singular individ-
ual addressee reference).
However, they treated the two tasks in isola-
tion, and also broke the addressee-reference prob-
lem into two separate sub-tasks (singular vs. plu-
ral reference, and singular addressee reference). A
full computational you-resolution module would
need to treat all tasks (either simultaneously as one
joint classification problem, or as a cascaded se-
quence) ? with inaccuracy at one task necessar-
ily affecting performance at another ? and we ex-
amine this here. In addition, we examine the ef-
fect of lexical features, following a similar insight
to Katzenmaier et al (2004); they used language
modelling to help distinguish between user- and
robot-directed utterances, as people use different
language for the two ? we expect that the same is
true for human participants.
3 Method
We used Frampton et al (2009)?s AMI corpus
data: 948 ?you?-containing utterances, manu-
ally annotated for referentiality and accompanied
by the AMI corpus? original addressee annota-
tion. The very small number of two-person ad-
dressee cases were joined with the three-person
(i.e. all non-speaker) cases to form a single ?plu-
ral? class. 49% of cases are generic; 32% of
referential cases are plural, and the rest are ap-
proximately evenly distributed between the singu-
lar participants. While Frampton et al (2009) la-
belled singular reference by physical location rel-
ative to the speaker (giving a 3-way classification
problem), our lexical features are more suited to
detecting actual participant identity ? we there-
fore recast the singular reference task as a 4-way
classification problem and re-calculate their per-
formance figures (giving very similar accuracies).
Discourse Features We use Frampton et al
(2009)?s discourse features. These include sim-
ple durational and lexical/phrasal features (includ-
ing mention of participant names); AMI dialogue
act features; and features expressing the simi-
larity between the current utterance and previ-
ous/following utterances by other participants. As
dialogue act features are notoriously hard to tag
automatically, and ?forward-looking? information
about following utterances may be unavailable in
an on-line system, we examine the effect of leav-
ing these out below.
Visual Features Again we used Frampton et al
(2009)?s features, extracted from the AMI corpus
manual focus-of-attention annotations which track
head orientiation and eye gaze. Features include
the target of gaze (any participant or the meet-
ing whiteboard/projector screen) during each ut-
terance, and information about mutual gaze be-
tween participants. These features may also not
always be available (meeting rooms may not al-
ways have cameras), so we investigate the effect
of their absence below.
Lexical Features The AMI Corpus simulates a
set of scenario-driven business meetings, with par-
ticipants performing a design task (the design of
a remote control). Participants are given specific
roles to play, for example that of project manager,
designer or marketing expert. It therefore seems
possible that utterances directed towards particular
individuals will involve the use of different vocab-
ularies reflecting their expertise. Different words
or phrases may also be associated with generic
and referential discussion, and extracting these au-
tomatically may give benefits over attempting to
capture them using manually-defined features. To
exploit this, we therefore added the use of lexical
features: one feature for each distinct word or n-
gram seen more than once in the corpus. Although
such features may be corpus- or domain-specific,
they are easy to extract given a transcript.
4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Individual Tasks
We first examine the effect of lexical features on
the individual tasks, using 10-way cross-validation
and comparing performance with Frampton et al
(2009). Table 1 shows the results for the referen-
tiality task in terms of overall accuracy and per-
class F1-scores; ?MC Baseline? is the majority-
class baseline; results labelled ?EACL? are Framp-
ton et al (2009)?s figures, and are presented for
all features and for reduced feature sets which
might be more realistic in various situations: ?-V?
removes visual features; ?-VFD? removes visual
features, forward-looking discourse features and
dialogue-act tag features.
As can be seen, adding lexical features
(?+words? adds single word features, ?+3grams?
adds n-gram features of lengths 1-3) improves the

performance significantly ? accuracy is improved
by 8.5% absolute above the best EACL results,
which is a 40% reduction in error. Robustness to
removal of potentially problematic features is also
improved: removing all visual, forward-looking
and dialogue act features makes little difference.
In fact, using only lexical n-gram features, while
reducing accuracy by 2.6%, still performs better
than the best EACL classifier.
Table 2 shows the equivalent results for the
singular-plural reference distinction task; in this
experiment, we used a correlation-based fea-
ture selection method, following Frampton et al
(2009). Again, performance is improved, this time
giving a 8.8% absolute accuracy improvement, or
38% error reduction; robustness to removing vi-
sual and dialogue act features is also very good,
even improving performance.
For the individual reference task (again using
feature selection), we give a further ?NS baseline?
of taking the next speaker; note that this performs
rather well, but requires forward-looking informa-
tion so should not be compared to ?-F? results.
Results are again improved (Table 3), but the im-
provement is smaller: a 1.4% absolute accuracy
improvement (7% error reduction); we conclude
from this that visual information is most impor-
tant for this part of the task. Robustness to feature
unavailability still shows some improvement: ex-

cluding all visual, forward-looking and dialogue-
act features has less effect than on the EACL sys-
tem (60.7% vs. 56.6% accuracy), and a system
using only n-grams and the next speaker identity
gives a respectable 74.5%.
Feature Analysis We examined the contribu-
tion of particular lexical features using Informa-
tion Gain methods. For the referentiality task, we
found that generic uses of you were more likely
to appear in utterances containing words related to
the main meeting topic, such as button, channel,
or volume (properties of the to-be-designed remote
control). In contrast, words related to meeting
management, such as presentation, email, project
and meeting itself, were predictive of referential
uses. The presence of first person pronouns and
discourse and politeness markers such as okay,
please and thank you was also indicative of refer-
entiality, as were n-grams capturing interrogative
structures (e.g. do you).
For the plural/singular distinction, we found
that the plural first person pronoun we correlated
with plural references of you. Other predictive n-
grams for this task were you mean and you know,
which were indicative of singular and plural refer-
ences, respectively. Finally, for the individual ref-
erence task, useful lexical features included par-
ticipant names, and items related to their roles.
For instance, the n-grams sales, to sell and make
money correlated with utterances addressed to the
?marketing expert?, while utterances containing
speech recognition and technical were addressed
to the ?industrial designer?.
Discussion The best F-score of the three sub-
tasks is for the generic/referential distinction; the

worst is for the detection of plural reference (Fplur
in Table 2). This is not surprising: humans find the
former task easy to annotate ? Gupta et al (2007)
report good inter-annotator agreement (? = 0.84)
? but the latter hard. In their analysis of the AMI
addressee annotations, Reidsma et al (2008) ob-
serve that most confusions amongst annotators are
between the group-addressing label and the labels
for individuals; whereas if annotators agree that an
utterance is addressed to an individual, they also
reach high agreement on that addressee?s identity.
4.2 Combined Task
We next combined the individual tasks into one
combined task; for each you instance, a 6-way
classification as generic, group-referring or refer-
ring to one of the 4 participants. This was at-
tempted both as a single classification exercise us-
ing a single Bayesian network; and as a cascaded
pipeline of the three individual tasks; see Table 4.
Both used correlation-based feature selection.
For the single joint classifier, n-grams again im-
prove performance over the EACL features. Using
only n-grams gives a significant improvement, per-
haps due to the reduction in the size of the feature
space on this larger problem. Accuracy is reason-
able (67.5%), but while F-scores are good for the
generic class (above 80%), others are low.
However, use of three cascaded classifiers
improves performance to 78% and gives large
per-class F-score improvements, exploiting
the higher accuracy of the first two stages
(generic/referential, singular/plural), and the fact
that different features are good for different tasks.
5 Conclusions
We have shown that the use of simple lexical fea-
tures can improve performance and robustness for
all aspects of second-person pronoun resolution:
referentiality detection and reference identifica-
tion. An overall 6-way classifier is feasible, and
cascading individual classifiers can help. Future
plans include testing on ASR transcripts, and in-
vestigating different classification techniques for
the joint task.
