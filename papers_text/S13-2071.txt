Abstract
The paper describes experiments using grid
searches over various combinations of ma-
chine learning algorithms, features and pre-
processing strategies in order to produce the
optimal systems for sentiment classification of
microblog messages. The approach is fairly
domain independent, as demonstrated by the
systems achieving quite competitive results
when applied to short text message data, i.e.,
input they were not originally trained on.
1 Introduction
The informal texts in microblogs such as Twitter
and on other social media represent challenges for
traditional language processing systems. The posts
(?tweets?) are limited to 140 characters and often
contain misspellings, slang and abbreviations. On
the other hand, the posts are often opinionated in
nature as a very result of their informal character,
which has led Twitter to being a gold mine for sen-
timent analysis (SA). SA for longer texts, such as
movie reviews, has been explored since the 1990s;1
however, the limited amount of attributes in tweets
makes the feature vectors shorter than in documents
and the task of analysing them closely related to
phrase- and sentence-level SA (Wilson et al, 2005;
Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). Hence there are
no guarantees that algorithms that perform well on
document-level SA will do as well on tweets. On
the other hand, it is possible to exploit some of the
special features of the web language, e.g., emoticons
1See Pang and Lee (2008); Feldman (2013) for overviews.
and emotionally loaded abbreviations. Thus the data
will normally go through some preprocessing before
any classification is attempted, e.g., by filtering out
Twitter specific symbols and functions, in particular
retweets (reposting another user?s tweet), mentions
(?@?, tags used to mention another user), hashtags
(?#?, used to tag a tweet to a certain topic), emoti-
cons, and URLs (linking to an external resource,
e.g., a news article or a photo). The first system to re-
ally use Twitter as a corpus was created as a student
course project at Stanford (Go et al, 2009). Pak and
Paroubek (2010) experimented with sentiment clas-
sification of tweets using Support Vector Machines
and Conditional Random Fields, benchmarked with
a Na??ve Bayes Classifier baseline, but were unable
to beat the baseline. Later, and as Twitter has grown
in popularity, many other systems for Twitter Senti-
ment Analysis (TSA) have been developed (see, e.g.,
Maynard and Funk, 2011; Mukherjee et al, 2012;
Saif et al, 2012; Chamlertwat et al, 2012).
Clearly, it is possible to classify the sentiment of
tweets in a single step; however, the approach to
TSA most used so far is a two-step strategy where
the first step is subjectivity classification and the
second step is polarity classification. The goal of
subjectivity classification is to separate subjective
and objective statements. Pak and Paroubek (2010)
counted word frequencies in a subjective vs an ob-
jective set of tweets; the results showed that in-
terjections and personal pronouns are the strongest
indicators of subjectivity. In general, these word
classes, adverbs and (in particular) adjectives (Hatzi-
vassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) have shown to be
good subjectivity indicators, which has made part-
430
of-speech (POS) tagging a reasonable technique for
filtering out objective tweets. Early research on
TSA showed that the challenging vocabulary made
it harder to accurately tag tweets; however, Gimpel
et al (2011) report on using a POS tagger for mark-
ing tweets, performing with almost 90% accuracy.
Polarity classification is the task of separating the
subjective statements into positives and negatives.
Kouloumpis et al (2011) tried different solutions for
tweet polarity classification, and found that the best
performance came from using n-grams together with
lexicon and microblog features. Interestingly, per-
formance dropped when a POS tagger was included.
They speculate that this can be due to the accuracy
of the POS tagger itself, or that POS tagging just is
less effective for analysing tweet polarity.
In this paper we will explore the application of
a set of machine learning algorithms to the task of
Twitter sentiment classification, comparing one-step
and two-step approaches, and investigate a range of
different preprocessing methods. What we explic-
itly will not do, is to utilise a sentiment lexicon, even
though many methods in TSA rely on lexica with a
sentiment score for each word. Nielsen (2011) man-
ually built a sentiment lexicon specialized for Twit-
ter, while others have tried to induce such lexica
automatically with good results (Velikovich et al,
2010; Mohammad et al, 2013). However, sentiment
lexica ? and in particular specialized Twitter senti-
ment lexica ? make the classification more domain
dependent. Here we will instead aim to exploit do-
main independent approaches as far as possible, and
thus abstain from using sentiment lexica. The rest of
the paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 introduces
the twitter data sets used in the study. Then Section 3
describes the system built for carrying out the twitter
sentiment classification experiments, which in turn
are reported and discussed in Sections 4 and 5.
2 Data
Manually collecting information from Twitter would
be a tedious task, but Twitter offers a well doc-
umented Representational State Transfer Applica-
tion Programming Interface (REST API) which al-
lows users to collect a corpus from the micro-
blogosphere. Most of the data used in TSA re-
search is collected through the Twitter API, either by

Table 1: The data sets used in the experiments
searching for a certain topic/keyword or by stream-
ing realtime data. Four different data sets were used
in the experiments described below. three were sup-
plied by the organisers of the SemEval?13 shared
task on Twitter sentiment analysis (Wilson et al,
2013), in the form of a training set, a smaller initial
development set, and a larger development set. All
sets consist of manually annotated tweets on a range
of topics, including different products and events.
Tweet-level classification (Task 2B) was split into
two subtasks in SemEval?13, one allowing training
only on the data sets supplied by the organisers (con-
strained) and one allowing training also on external
data (unconstrained). To this end, a web applica-
tion2 for manual annotation of tweets was built and
used to annotate a small fourth data set (?NTNU?).
Each of the 461 tweets in the ?NTNU? data set was
annotated by one person only.
The distribution of target classes in the data sets is
shown in Table 1. The data was neither preprocessed
nor filtered, and thus contain hashtags, URLs, emoti-
cons, etc. However, all the data sets provided by
SemEval?13 had more than three target classes (e.g.,
?objective?, ?objective-OR-neutral?), so tweets that
were not annotated as ?positive? or ?negative? were
merged into the ?neutral? target class.
Due to Twitter?s privacy policy, the given data sets
do not contain the tweet text, but only the tweet ID
which in turn can be used to download the text. The
Twitter API has a limit on the number of downloads
per hour, so SemEval?13 provided a Python script
to scrape texts from https://twitter.com. This
script was slow and did not download the texts for all
tweet IDs in the data sets, so a faster and more pre-
cise download script3 for node.js was implemented
and submitted to the shared task organisers.

3 Experimental Setup
In order to run sentiment classification experiments,
a general system was built. It has a Sentiment Anal-
ysis API Layer which works as a thin extension of
the Twitter API, sending all tweets received in par-
allel to a Sentiment Analysis Classifier server. After
classification, the SA API returns the same JSON
structure as the Twitter API sends out, only with an
additional attribute denoting the tweet?s sentiment.
The Sentiment Analysis Classifier system consists
of preprocessing and classification, described below.
3.1 Preprocessing
As mentioned in the introduction, most approaches
to Twitter sentiment analysis start with a pre-
processing step, filtering out some Twitter specific
symbols and functions. Go et al (2009) used ?:)?
and ?:(? as labels for the polarity, so did not remove
these emoticons, but replaced URLs and user names
with placeholders. Kouloumpis et al (2011) used
both an emoticon set and a hashtagged set. The lat-
ter is a subset of the Edinburgh Twitter corpus which
consists of 97 million tweets (Petrovic? et al, 2010).
Some approaches have also experimented with nor-
malizing the tweets, and removing redundant letters,
e.g., ?loooove? and ?crazyyy?, that are used to ex-
press a stronger sentiment in tweets. Redundant let-
ters are therefore often not deleted, but words rather
trimmed down to one additional redundant letter, so
that the stronger sentiment can be taken into consid-
eration by a score/weight adjustment for that feature.
To find the best features to use, a set of eight dif-
ferent combinations of preprocessing methods was
designed, as detailed in Table 2. These include no
preprocessing (P0, not shown in the table), where
all characters are included as features; full remove
(P4), where all special Twitter features like user
names, URLs, hashtags, retweet (RT ) tags, and
emoticons are stripped; and replacing Twitter fea-
tures with placeholder texts to reduce vocabulary.
The ?hashtag as word? method transforms a hashtag
to a regular word and uses the hashtag as a feature.
?Reduce letter duplicate? removes redundant char-
acters more than three (?happyyyyyyyy!!!!!!? ?
?happyyy!!!?). Some methods, like P1, P2, P4, P5
and P7 remove user names from the text, as they
most likely are just noise for the sentiment. Still,

Remove emoticons X X

Table 2: Overview of the preprocessing methods
the fact that there are references to URLs and user
names might be relevant for the sentiment. To make
these features more informative for the machine
learning algorithms, a preprocessing method (P3)
was implemented for replacing them with place-
holders. In addition, a very rudimentary treatment
of negation was added, in which the negation is at-
tached to the preceding and following words, so that
they will also reflect the change in sentence polarity.
Even though this preprocessing obviously is
Twitter-specific, the results after it will still be do-
main semi-independent, in as far as the strings pro-
duced after the removal of URLs, user names, etc.,
will be general, and can be used for system training.
3.2 Classification
The classification step currently supports three
machine learning algorithms from the Python
scikit-learn4 package: Na??ve Bayes (NB),
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Support Vector
Machines (SVM). These are all among the super-
vised learners that previously have been shown to
perform well on TSA, e.g., by Bermingham and
Smeaton (2010) who compared SVM and NB for
microblogs. Interestingly, while the SVM technique
normally beats NB and MaxEnt on longer texts, that
comparison indicated that it has some trouble with
outperforming NB when feature vectors are shorter.
Three different models were implemented:
1. One-step model: a single algorithm classifies
tweets as negative, neutral or positive.
2. Two-step model: the tweets are first classified
as either subjective or neutral. Those that are

Figure 1: Performance across all models (red=precision, blue=recall, green=F1-score, brown=accuracy)
classified as subjective are then sent to polarity
classification (i.e., negative or positive).
3. Boosting (Freund and Schapire, 1997): a way
to combine classifiers by generating a set of
sub-models, each of which predicts a sentiment
on its own and then sends it to a voting process
that selects the sentiment with highest score.
In all cases, the final classification is returned to the
API Layer sentiment provider.
4 Experimental Results
Experiments were carried out using the platform in-
troduced in the previous section, with models built
on the training set of Table 1. The testing system
generates and trains different models based on a set
of parameters, such as classification algorithm, pre-
processing methods, whether or not to use inverse
document frequency (IDF) or stop words. A grid
search option can be activated, so that a model is
generated with the best possible parameter set for
the given algorithm, using 10-fold cross validation.
4.1 Selection of Learners and Features
An extensive grid search was conducted. This search
cycled through different algorithms, parameters and
preprocessing techniques. The following param-
eters were included in the search. Three binary
(Yes/No) parameters: Use IDF, Use Smooth
IDF, and Use Sublinear IDF, together with
ngram (unigram/bigram/trigram). SVM
and MaxEnt models in addition included C and
NB models alpha parameters, all with the value
ranges [0.1/0.3/0.5/0.7/0.8/1.0]. SVM
and MaxEnt models also had penalty (L1/L2).
Figure 1 displays the precision, recall, F1-score,
and accuracy for each of the thirteen classifiers with
the Dev 2 data set (see Table 1) used for evaluation.
Note that most classifiers involving the NB algo-
rithm perform badly, both in terms of accuracy and
F-score. This was observed for the other data sets as
well. Further, we can see that one-step classifiers did
better than two-step models, with MaxEnt obtaining
the best accuracy, but SVM a slightly better F-score.

Table 3: Best classifier performance (bold=best score;
all classifiers were trained on the training set of Table 1)
A second grid search with the two best classifiers
from the first search was performed instead using the
smaller Dev 1 data set for evaluation. The results
for both the SVM and MaxEnt classifiers are shown
in Table 3. With the Dev 1 data set, SVM performs
much better than MaxEnt. The larger Dev 2 develop-
ment set contains more neutral tweets than the Dev 1
set, which gives us reasons to believe that evaluating
on the Dev 2 set favours the MaxEnt classifier.
A detailed error analysis was conducted by in-
specting the confusion matrices of all classifiers. In
general, classifiers involving SVM tend to give bet-
ter confusion matrices than the others. Using SVM
only in a one-step model works well for positive and
neutral tweets, but a bit poorer for negative. Two-
step models with SVM-based subjectivity classifica-
tion exhibit the same basic behaviour. The one-step
MaxEnt model classifies more tweets as neutral than
the other classifiers. Using MaxEnt for subjectivity
classification and either MaxEnt or SVM for polarity
classification performs well, but is too heavy on the
positive class. Boosting does not improve and be-
haves in a fashion similar to two-step MaxEnt mod-
els. All combinations involving NB tend to heavily
favour positive predictions; only the two-step mod-
els involving another algorithm for polarity classifi-
cation gave some improvement for negative tweets.
The confusion matrices of the two best learners
are shown in Figures 2a-2d, where a learner is shown
to perform better if it has redish colours on the main
diagonal and blueish in the other fields, as is the case
for SVM on the Dev 1 data set (Figure 2c).
As a part of the grid search, all preprocessing
methods were tested for each classifier. Figure 3
shows that P2 (removing user names, URLs, hash-
tags prefixes, retweet tokens, and redundant letters)
is the preprocessing method which performs best

4.2 SemEval?13 NTNU Systems and Results
Based on the information from the grid search, two
systems were built for SemEval?13. Since one-step
SVM-based classification showed the best perfor-
mance on the training data, it was chosen for the
system participating in the constrained subtask, NT-
NUC. The preprocessing also was the one with the
best performance on the provided data, P2 which
involves lower-casing all letters; reducing letter du-
plicates; using hashtags as words (removing #); and
removing all URLs, user names and RT -tags.
Given the small size of the in-house (?NTNU?)
data set, no major improvement was expected from
adding it in the unconstrained task. Instead, a rad-
ically different set-up was chosen to create a new
system, and train it on both the in-house and pro-
vided data. NTNUU utilizes a two-step approach,
with SVM for subjectivity and MaxEnt for polarity
classification, a combination intended to capture the
strengths of both algorithms. No preprocessing was
used for the subjectivity step, but user names were
removed before attempting polarity classification.
As further described by Wilson et al (2013), the
SemEval?13 shared task involved testing on a set of
3813 tweets (1572 positive, 601 negative, and 1640
neutral). In order to evaluate classification perfor-
mance on data of roughly the same length and type,
but from a different domain, the evaluation data also
included 2094 Short Message Service texts (SMS;
492 positive, 394 negative, and 1208 neutral).
Table 4 shows the results obtained by the NTNU
systems on the SemEval?13 evaluation data, in terms
of average precision, recall and F-score for all three
classes, as well as average F-score for positive and
negative tweets only (F1+/?; i.e., the measure used
to rank the systems participating in the shared task).
5 Discussion and Conclusion
As can be seen in Table 4, the extra data available
to train the NTNUU system did not really help it:
it gets outperformed by NTNUC on all measures.
Notably, both systems perform well on the out-
of-domain data represented by the SMS messages,
which is encouraging and indicates that the approach
taken really is domain semi-independent. This was
also reflected in the rankings of the two systems in
the shared task: both were on the lower half among
the participating systems on Twitter data (24th/36
resp. 10th/15), but near the top on SMS data, with
NTNUC being ranked 5th of 28 constrained systems
and NTNUU 6th of 15 unconstrained systems.
Comparing the results to those shown in Table 3
and Figure 1, NTNUC?s (SVM) performance is in
line with that on Dev 2, but substantially worse
than on Dev 1; NTNUU (SVM?MaxEnt) performs
slightly worse too. Looking at system output with
and without the ?NTNU? data, both one-step SVM
and MaxEnt models and SVM?MaxEnt classified
more tweets as negative when trained on the ex-
tra data; however, while NTNUC benefited slightly
from this, NTNUU even performed better without it.
An obvious extension to the present work would
be to try other classification algorithms (e.g., Condi-
tional Random Fields or more elaborate ensembles)
or other features (e.g., character n-grams). Rather
than the very simple treatment of negation used
here, an approach to automatic induction of scope
through a negation detector (Councill et al, 2010)
could be used. It would also be possible to relax
the domain-independence further, in particular to
utilize sentiment lexica (including twitter specific),
e.g., by automatic phrase-polarity lexicon extraction
(Velikovich et al, 2010). Since many users tweet
from their smartphones, and a large number of them
use iPhones, several tweets contain iPhone-specific
smilies (?Emoji?). Emoji are implemented as their
own character set (rather than consisting of charac-
ters such as ?:)? and ?:(?, etc.), so a potentially major
improvement could be to convert them to character-
based smilies or to emotion-specific placeholders.
