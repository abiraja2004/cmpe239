1 Introduction 
This paper is about machine learning methods for 
identifying bwnsr'ts'~zs, which correspond to English 
phrasal units such as noun phrases and t)rel)ositional 
phrases. Since .Japanes(.' syntactic analysis ix usu- 
ally done after lmnselisu identitication (Uchimot;o el; 
a\].. 1999), i(lentitlying lmnsetsu is important l'or an- 
alyzing ,J;~p~tnese ltt(}tl(:es. The  conventional stud- 
ies on lmnsetsu  identitieation ~ have used hand-made 
rules (Kameda, \]995; Kurohashi, 3998), })ill; bun- 
sel;su identification is not an easy task. Conventional 
studies used many hand-nmde rules develot)ed at the 
cost of many man-hours. Kurohashi, tbr examl)le, 
made 146 rules for lmnsetsu identification (Kuro- 
hashi, 1998). 
Itl }l.tl a . t te t l lp t  to reduce the mnnber of man- 
hours, we used machine-learning methods for bun- 
setsu identitication. Because it; was not clear which 
machine-learning method would 1)e the one most al)- 
propriate for bunsctsu identification, so we tried a 
variety of them. In this paper we rei)orl; ext)er- 
inlel lts comparing tbur inachine-learning me, thods 
(decision tree, maximmn entropy, example-based, 
and decision list; methods) and our new methods us- 
ing category-exclusive rules. 
l lhmsetsu ideni,illcation is a ln'oblem similar to ohm,king 
(lLamshaw and Marcus, 1995; Sang and \h;ellsl;ra, 1999) in 
other l;mguages. 
2 Bunsetsu identification problem 
We conducted experiments (m the following super- 
vised learning methods tbr idel~tiflying }mnsetsu: 
? \])eeision {;l'ee method 
? Max i lnun l  ent ropy  method  
? Examt)le-based method (use of sinfilarity) 
? Decision list (use of probability and frequency) 
? Method 1 (use of exclusive rules) 
? Method 2 (use of exclusive rules with the high- 
est similarity). 
In general, t)misetsu identification is (tone afl;er 
morl)hological and l)efore syntactic analysis. Mor- 
1)hological analysis correst)onds to part-of-st)ee(:h 
tagging ill English. Japanese syntactic structures are 
usually ref)resented by the. relations between lmn- 
setsus, which correspond to l)hrasal units such as a 
noml l)hrase or a t)repositional 1)hrase in \]r, nglish. 
St), 1)unsetsu identification is imi)ortant in .lnpanese 
sentence mmlysis. 
In this paper, we identit\[y a bunsetsu by using 
intbrmation Dora a morl~hological nalysis. Bun- 
setsu identitication is treated as the task of deciding 
whether to insert a "\[" mark to indicate the partition 
between two hunsetsus as in Figure 1. There, fore, 
bunsetsu identilical;ion is done by judging whether a
partition mark should be inserted between two adja- 
cent nlorphemes or not. (We. do not use l;he inserted 
partition mark in the tbllowing analysis ill this paper 
for the sake of simplicity.) 
Our lmnsetsu identification method uses i;t1(} lilOr- 
phok)gk:al intbrmation of the two preceding and two 
succeeding morphemes ofan analyzed space bel;ween 
two adjacent morphemes. We use the following mor- 
phological information: 
(i) Major part-of  speech (POS) category, 2 
(ii) Minor P()S category or intlection tYl)e, 
(iii) Semantic information (the first three-digit nun> 
bet of a category nmnlmr as used ill "BGIt" 
(NLI{,I, 1964:)), 
2Part-of-spec.ch ~ttegories follow those of 3 \[/MAN (Kuro- 
hashi and N~tgao, 1998).

For simplicity we do not use the "Semmltic infor-

morphemes. 
Figure 2 shows the information used to judge 
whether or not to insert a partition mark in the space 
between two adjacent morphemes, "wo (obj)" and 
"kugiru (divide)," in the sentence "bun wo kugiru. 
((I) divide sentences)." 
3 Bunsetsu  ident i f i ca t ion  process  fo r  
each  mach ine- learn ing  method 
a.1 Deeision-tree method 
In this work we used the program C4.5 (Quinlan, 
1.995) for the decision-tree l arning method. The 
four types of information, (i) major POS, (ii) mi- 
nor POS, (iii) semmltic information, and (iv) word, 
mentioned in the previous section were also used 
as features with the decision-tree l arning method. 
As shown in Figure 3, the number of features is 12 
(2 + 4 + 4 + 2) because we do not use (iii) semantic 
information and (iv) word information from the two 
outside morphemes. 
In Figure 2, for example, the value of the feature 
'the major POS of the far left morpheme' is 'Noun.' 
a.2 Maximum-entropy method 
The maximum-entropy method is useful with sparse 
data conditions and has been used by many re- 
searchers (Berger et al, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; 
Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Borthwick el; al., 1998; Uchi- 
moto et al, 1999). In our maximuln-entropy exper- 
iment we used Ristad's system (Ristad, 1998). The 
analysis is performed by calculating the probability 
of inserting or not inserting a partition mark, from 
the output of the system. Whichever probability is 
higher is selected as the desired answer. 
In the maximum-entropy method, we use the same 
four types of morI)hological information, (i) major 
POS, (ii) minor POS, (iii) semantic information, and 
(iv) word, as in the decision-tree method. However, 
it, does not consider a combination of features. Un- 
like the decision-tree method, as a result, we had to 
combine features mmmally. 
First we considered a combination of the bits of 
each morphological information. Because there were 
four types of information, the total number of com- 
binations was 2 ~-  1. Since this number is large 
and intractable, we considered that (i) major POS, 
(ii) minor POS, (iii) semantic information, aim (iv) 
word information gradually becolne inore specific in 
this order, and we coml)ined the four types of infor- 
mation in the following way: 
Information A: (i) major POS 
Intbrmation B: (i) major POS and (ii) minor POS 
hfformat, ion C: (i) major POS, (ii) minor POS and 
(iii) semantic information 
Information D: (i) major POS, (ii) minor POS, 
(iii) semantic informa~aion a d (iv) word 
(~) 
We used only Information A and B for the two out- 
side morphemes because we (lid not use semantic 
and word information in the same way it is used in 
the decision-tree inethod. 
Next, we considered the combinations ofeach type 
of information. As shown in Figure 4, the number 
of combinations was 64 (2 x 4 x 4 x 2). 
For data sparseness, in addition to the above com- 
binations, we considered the cases in which frst, one 
of the two outside morphemes was not used, sec- 
ondly, neither of the two outside ones were used, m~d 
thirdly, only one of the two middle ones is used. The 
nmnber of features used in the maximum-entropy 
method is 152, which is obtained as follows: a

Particle: none: wo; Verl): Nornml Form: 217; Sym- 
bol". In tim maximmn-entrol)y method we used for 
each space 152 ligatures uch as this ()tie. 
3.3  Example -based  method (use of  
s imi lar i ty)  
An example-based method was t)rollosed t) 3, Nagao 
(Nagao, 1984) in an attempt to solve I)roblenls in 
machine translation. To resolve a. l)rol)h'm, it; uses 
the most similar (;xami)le. In the i)resent work, the 
examt)le-1)ased method imt)artially used the same 
four types of information (see Eli. (1)) as used in 
the maxinmm-entrotly method, 
To use tills method, we must define the similarity 
of an ini)ut to an example. We use the 152 1)atterns 
fl'om the maximum-entropy method to establish the 
level of similarity. We define the similarity S be- 
tween all input and an exmnl)le according to which 
one of these 152 levels is the lnatching level, as fol- 
lows. (The equation reflects the importance of the 
two middle morphemes.) 
January 1, 1995 of a Kyoto University corpus (l;hc mnnber of 
spaces between mrl)henms was 25,81d) by using this method, 
the nunfl)e,r of types of features was 1,534,701. 
S = s(m_t) x s(m-H) x 10,000 
+ s(m_2) x s(.q.~) (2) 
Here m- l ,  m4-\], m-2, and m+2 refer respectively to 
the left;, rigid;, far M't, ;rod far righl; mortflmnms, and 
s(x) is the mort)hological similarity of a ll lOl't)hell le 
x, which is defined as follows: 
s(x) =1 (when no information of x is matched) 
2 (when Information A of x is matdmd) 
3 (when hfl~)rmal:ion B of x is mate, heal) 
4 (when Information C of x is mat;cited) 
5 (when Information D of x is matched) 
(a) 
Figure 5 shows an exmnple of the levels of sim- 
ilarity. When a pattern matches Information A of 
all four lnort)henies , uch as "Noun; Particle; Verb; 
Symbol", its similarity is 40,004 (2 x 2 x 10,000 + 
2 x 2). When a pattern matches a pattern, such as 
" ; Particle: Case-Particle: none: wo; ; ", its 
similarity is 50,001 (5 x 1 x 10,000 + 1 x 1). 
The exmnl)le-1)ased method extracts the exam- 
ple with the highest level of similm'ity and checks 
whether or not that exami)le is marked. A partition 
marl{ is inserted in tile input data only when the ex~ 
amt)le iv marked. When multit)le exalnl)les have the 
same highest level of similarity, the selection of tile 
best example is ambiguous, hi this case, we count 
tile number of nlarked and mlinarked sl)aces in all 
of the examples and choose the larger. 
a .4  Decis ion- l ist  method (use of p robab i l i ty  
and f l ' equeney)  
T i le  decision-list method was proposed by Rivest 
(Rivest, 1987), in which tile rules are not expressed 
as a tree structure like in the decision-tree method,

Figure 5: Exmnple of levels of similarity 
but are expanded by combining all the features, and 
are stored in a one-dimensional list. A priority or- 
der is defined in a certain way and all of the rules 
are arranged in this order. The decision-list method 
searches for rules Dora tile top of the list and an- 
alyzes a particular problem by using only the first 
applicable rule. 
In this study we used ill the decision-list method 
the same 152 types of patterns that were used in/;lie 
ma.ximuln-entropy method. 
To determine the priority order of the rules, we re- 
ferred to Yarowsky's method (Yarowsky, 1994) and 
Nishiokwama's method (Nishiokaymna et al, 1998) 
and used the probability a.nd frequency of each rule 
as measures of this priority order. When nnlltiple 
rifles had the same probability, the rules were ar- 
ranged in order of their frequency. 
Suppose, for example, that Pattern A "Noun: 
Normal Noun; Particle: Case-Particle: none: wo; 
Verb: Normal Form: 217; Symhol: Punctuatioif' 
occurs 13 times in a learlfing set and that tell of 
the occurrences include the inserted partition Inal:k. 
Suppose also thai; Pattern B "Noun; Particle; Verb; 
Symbol" occurs 12a times in a learning set and that 
90 of the occurrences include the mark. 
This exmnple is recognized by the following rules: 
Pattern A ~ Partition 76.9% (10/ 13), Freq. 23 
Pattern B => Partition 73.2% (90/123), Freq. 123 
Many similar rules were made and were then listed 
in order of their probabilities and, for any one prob- 
ability, in order of their frequencies. This list was 
searched from tile top ml(:l the answer was obtained 
by using the first, ai)plicable rule. 
3.5 Method  I (use of eategory-exe lus ive  
rules) 
So far, we have described the four existing machine 
learning methods. In the next two sections we de- 
scribe our methods. 
It is reasoimble to consider tile 152 patterns used 
in three of the previous methods. Now, let us sup- 
pose that the 152 patterns fl'om the learning set yield 
the statistics of Figure 6. 
"Partition" means that the rule determines that a 
partition mark should be inserted in the input data 
and "non-t)arl:ition" ineans that tile rule determines 
that a partition mark should not be inserted. 
Suppose that when we solve a hypothetical prob- 
lem Patterns A to G are apt)licable. If we use the 
decision-list inethod, only Rule A is used, which is 
applied first, and this determines that a partition 
mark should not be inserted. For Rules B, C, and 
D, although the fl'equency of each rule is lower thml 
that of Rule A, tile suln of their frequencies of the 
rules is higher, so we think that it is better to use 
Rules B, C, ml(t D than Rule A. Method 1 follows 
this idea, but we do not simply sum up tile frequen- 
cies. Instead, we count the munber of exalnples used 
ill Rules B~ C, and D and judge the category having 
tile largest number of exmnplcs that satisfy the pat- 
tern with the highest probability to be the desired 
ai1swer. 
For exmnple, suppose that in the above examt)le 
the number of examples atis(ying Rules B, C, and 
D is 65. (Because some exmnples overlq) in multi- 
pie rules, the total nunfl)er of exalnples is actually 
smaller than the total number of tile frequencies of 
the three rules.) In this case, among the examples 
used by the rules having 100% probability, tile nmn- 
ber of examples of partition is 65, m~d the number 
of examt)les of non-t)artitioi~ s 34. So, we deternline 
that tile desired answer is to partition. 
A rule having 100% probability is called a 
category-exclusive rule because all the data satist~y- 
ing it belong to one category, which is either parti- 
tion or noi>partition. Because for any given space 
the number of rules used call be as large as 152, 
category-exclusive rules are applie(t often ~. Method 
1 uses all of these category-exclusive rules, so we call 
it tile method using category-exclusive rules. 
Solving problems by using rules whose prol)abili- 
l;ies are nol; 100% may result ill the wrong solutions. 
Almost all of the traditional machine learning meth- 
ods solve problelns by usiug rules whose i)robabilities 
4'l'he ratio of the spaces analyzed by using category- 
exclusive rules is 99.30% (16864/16983) in Experiinent 1 of 
Section d. This indicates that ahnost all of the spaces are 
analyzed by category-exclusive rules.

method.  Al though the maximuln-entropy 
method has a weak point  in that  it, does not 
learn the combinat ions of features, we could 
overcome this weakness by malting almost all of 
the combilmtions of features to produce a higher 
accuracy rate. 
? Tile decision-list n lethod was bet ter  t itan the 
maximum-entropy method in this experinmnt.  
? Tile example-based nlethod obtained the high- 
est accuracy rate among the four exist ing meth- 
ods. 
? Altt lough Method 1, which uses tim category- 
exclusive rule, was worse than the exmnple- 
based method,  it was better  than ti le decision- 
list method.  One reason for this was that  
ti le decision-l ist metl lod chooses rules rmldomly 
when mult iple rules have identical probabi l i t ies 
mid fl'equeneies. 
? Method 2, which uses the category-exchlsive 
rule with the highest similarity, achieved the 
highest accuracy rate among ti le supervised 
learning methods.  
? Tim example-based method,  tim decision-l ist 
inethod, Method 1 and Method 2 obta ined ac- 
curacy rates of about  100% for the leanfing set. 
This indicates that  these methods m:e especial ly 
strong for learning sets. 
? Tile two methods using similarity example-  
based method mid Method 2) were always bet-  
ter than the other methods, indicat ing that  the 
use of s imilar ity is eflective if we can define it 
approl)r iately. 
? We carried out experinmnts by using KNP,  a 
system that  uses ninny ha.nd-made rules. The 
F-measure of KNP was highest in the test set. 
? We used two versions of KNP, KNP 2.0b4 and 
KNP 2.0b6. The lat ter  was mud l  better  t lmn 
tlm former, iudicat ing tha.t the improvements 
made by hand are  effective. But, the mainte-  
nance of rules by hand has a l imit, so the im- 
provements made by hand are not always effec- 
tive. 
Tlle above exper iments indicate that  Method 2 is 
best among the machine learning methods '5. 
In Table 5 we show some cases which were par- 
t i t ioned incorrectly with KNP but correctly with 
51n these experiments, the. differences were very small. 
But, we think that the differences are significant to some ex- 
tent because we performed Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, 
the data we used are a large corplls containing about a few 
ten thousand morphemes and tagged objectively in advance, 
and the difference of about 0.1% is large in the precisions of 
99%.

Method 2. A partition with "NEED" indicates that 
KNP missed inserting the i)artition mark, and a par- 
tition with "WRONG" indicates that KNP inserted 
the partitiol~ mark incorrectly. In the test set of Ex- 
periment 1, the F-measure of KNP2.0b6 was 99.66%. 
The F-measur(. ~ increases to 99.83%, ml(ler the as- 
sumption that when KNP2.0t)6 or Method 2 in cor- 
rect, the answer is correct. Although the accuracy 
rate for KNP2.0b6 was high, there were some cases 
in which KNP t)artitioned incorrectly and Method 
2 partitioned correctly, A combination of Method 
2 with KNP2.0b6 may be able to iml)rove the F- 
lile~lsllrO. 
The only 1)revious research resolving Imnnetsu 
identification by machine learning methods, in the 
work by Zhang (Zhang and Ozeki, 1998). The 
decision-tree, ine, thod was used in this work. But 
this work used only a small mmther of intor- 
l l l;ttion for t)llllsetsll identification" and (lid not 
achieve ll igh accuracy rat;es. (The  recall  rate 
was 97 .6%(=2502/ (2502+62) ) ,  the 1)recision rate 
was 92 .4%(=2502/ (2502+205) ) ,  and F -measure  was 
94.2%.) 
5 Conc lus ion  
To solve tile t)roblem of aecm'ate btmsetsu iden- 
tification, we carried out ext)eriments comt)aring 
tbur existing machine-learning methods (decision- 
tree method, maxilnum-entrol)y method, examI)le- 
based method and decision-list method). We ob- 
tained the following order of acem'acy in bunsetsu 
identification. 
Example-Based > Decision List > 
Maximum Entropy > Decision Tree 
We also described a new method which uses 
category-exclusive rules with the highest similarity. 
This method performed better than the other learn- 
ing methods in ore" exi)eriments.

phemes of an analyzed space.
