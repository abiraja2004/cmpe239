Abstract
We present a new edition of the Google Books
Ngram Corpus, which describes how often
words and phrases were used over a period
of five centuries, in eight languages; it reflects
6% of all books ever published. This new edi-
tion introduces syntactic annotations: words
are tagged with their part-of-speech, and head-
modifier relationships are recorded. The an-
notations are produced automatically with sta-
tistical models that are specifically adapted to
historical text. The corpus will facilitate the
study of linguistic trends, especially those re-
lated to the evolution of syntax.
1 Introduction
The Google Books Ngram Corpus (Michel et al.,
2011) has enabled the quantitative analysis of lin-
guistic and cultural trends as reflected in millions
of books written over the past five centuries. The
corpus consists of words and phrases (i.e., ngrams)
and their usage frequency over time. The data is
available for download, and can also be viewed
through the interactive Google Books Ngram Viewer
at http://books.google.com/ngrams.
The sheer quantity of and broad historical scope
of the data has enabled a wide range of analyses
(Michel et al., 2011; Ravallion, 2011). Of course,
examining raw ngram frequencies is of limited util-
ity when studying many aspects of linguistic change,
particularly the ones related to syntax. For instance,
most English verbs are regular (their past tense is
formed by adding -ed), and the few exceptions,
known as irregular verbs, tend to regularize over the

centuries (Lieberman et al., 2007). Figure 1 illus-
trates how burned gradually overtook burnt, becom-
ing more frequent around 1880. Unfortunately, as a
study of verb regularization, this analysis is skewed
by a significant confound: both words can serve
as either verbs (e.g., the house burnt) or adjectives
(e.g., the burnt toast). Because many words have
multiple syntactic interpretations, such confounds
often limit the utility of raw ngram frequency data.
In this work we provide a new edition of the
Google Books Ngram Corpus that contains over 8
million books, or 6% of all books ever published (cf.
Section 3). Moreover, we include syntactic anal-
ysis in order to facilitate a fine-grained analysis of
the evolution of syntax. Ngrams are annotated with
part-of-speech tags (e.g., in the phrase he burnt the
toast, burnt is a verb; in the burnt toast, burnt is an
adjective) and head-modifier dependencies (e.g., in
the phrase the little black book, little modifies book).
The annotated ngrams are far more useful for ex-
169
amining the evolution of grammar and syntax. For
our study of the regularization of the verb burn,
the availability of syntactic annotations resolves the
verb vs. adjective ambiguity in the original data, al-
lowing us to only examine instances where burnt
and burned appear as verbs. This more refined anal-
ysis suggests a crossover date for the frequency of
the verb forms that is several decades earlier than
the overall (verbs and adjectives) crossover.
We use state-of-the-art statistical part-of-speech
taggers and dependency parsers to produce syntac-
tic annotations for eight languages in the Google
Books collection. The annotations consist of 12 lan-
guage universal part-of-speech tags and unlabeled
head-modifier dependencies. Section 4 describes the
models that we used and the format of the annota-
tions in detail. We assess the expected annotation
accuracies experimentally and discuss how we adapt
the taggers and parsers to historical text in Section 5.
The annotated ngrams are available as a new edition
of the Google Books Ngram Corpus; we provide
some examples from the new corpus in Figure 3.
2 Related Work
Michel et al. (2011) described the construction of
the first edition of the Google Books Ngram Corpus
and used it to quantitatively analyze a variety of top-
ics ranging from language growth to public health.
The related Ngram Viewer has become a popular
tool for examining language trends by experts and
non-experts alike.
In addition to studying frequency patterns in the
data, researchers have also attempted to analyze the
grammatical function of the ngrams (Davies, 2011).
Such endeavors are hampered by the fact that the
Ngram Corpus provides only aggregate statistics in
the form of ngram counts and not the full sen-
tences. Furthermore, only ngrams that pass certain
occurrence thresholds are publicly available, making
any further aggregation attempt futile: in heavy tail
distributions like the ones common in natural lan-
guages, the counts of rare events (that do not pass
the frequency threshold) can have a large cumula-
tive mass.
In contrast, because we have access to the full
text, we can annotate ngrams to reflect the particu-
lar grammatical functions they take in the sentences

they were extracted from, and can also account for
the contribution of rare ngrams to otherwise frequent
grammatical functions.
3 Ngram Corpus
The Google Books Ngram Corpus has been avail-
able at http://books.google.com/ngrams
since 2010. This work presents new corpora that
have been extracted from an even larger book collec-
tion, adds a new language (Italian), and introduces
syntactically annotated ngrams. The new corpora
are available in addition to the already existing ones.
3.1 Books Data
The new edition of the Ngram Corpus supports the
eight languages shown in Table 1. The book vol-
umes were selected from the larger collection of all
books digitized at Google following exactly the pro-
cedure described in Michel et al. (2011). The new
edition contains data from 8,116,746 books, or over
6% of all books ever published. The English cor-
pus alone comprises close to half a trillion words.
This collection of books is much larger than any
other digitized collection; its generation required a
substantial effort involving obtaining and manually
scanning millions of books.
3.2 Raw Ngrams
We extract ngrams in a similar way to the first edi-
tion of the corpus (Michel et al., 2011), but with
some notable differences. Previously, tokenization
was done on whitespace characters and all ngrams
occurring on a given page were extracted, includ-
ing ones that span sentence boundaries, but omitting

ngrams that span page boundaries.
Instead, we perform tokenization and sentence
boundary detection by applying a set of manually
devised rules (except for Chinese, where a statistical
system is used for segmentation). We capture sen-
tences that span across page boundaries, and then
extract ngrams only within sentences. As is typically
done in language model estimation, we add sentence
beginning ( START ) and end tokens ( END ) that
are included in the ngram extraction. This allows us
to distinguish ngrams that appear in sentence-medial
positions from ngrams that occur at sentence bound-
aries (e.g., START John).
3.3 Differences to the First Edition
The differences between this edition and the first
edition of the Ngram Corpus are as follows: (i) the
underlying book collection has grown substantially
in the meantime; (ii) OCR technology and metadata
extraction have improved, resulting in higher qual-
ity digitalization; (iii) ngrams spanning sentence
boundaries are omitted, and ngrams spanning page
boundaries are included. As a result, this new edi-
tion is not a superset of the first edition.
4 Syntactic Annotations
In addition to extracting raw ngrams, we part-of-
speech tag and parse the entire corpus and extract
syntactically annotated ngrams (see Figure 2). We
use manually annotated treebanks of modern text
(often newswire) as training data for the POS tag-
ger and parser models. We discuss our approach to
adapting the models to historical text in Section 5.
1Pronouns and determiners are not explicitly annotated in
the Russian treebank. As a result, the most common Russian
nouns in the table are pronouns.
4.1 Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging is one of the most funda-
mental disambiguation steps in any natural lan-
guage processing system. Over the years, POS tag-
ging accuracies have steadily improved, appearing
to plateau at an accuracy level that approaches hu-
man inter-annotator agreement (Manning, 2011). As
we demonstrate in the next section, these numbers
are misleading since they are computed on test data
that is very close to the training domain. We there-
fore need to specifically adapt our models to handle
noisy and historical text.
We perform POS tagging with a state-of-the-art2
Conditional Random Field (CRF) based tagger (Laf-
ferty et al., 2001) trained on manually annotated
treebank data. We use the following fairly standard
features in our tagger: current word, suffixes and
prefixes of length 1, 2 and 3; additionally we use
word cluster features (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008)
for the current word, and transition features of the
cluster of the current and previous word.
To provide a language-independent interface, we
use the universal POS tagset described in detail in
Petrov et al. (2012). This universal POS tagset de-
fines the following twelve POS tags, which exist
in similar form in most languages: NOUN (nouns),
VERB (verbs), ADJ (adjectives), ADV (adverbs),
PRON (pronouns), DET (determiners and articles),
ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (nu-
merals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), ?.?
(punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other cat-
egories such as abbreviations or foreign words).
Table 2 shows the two most common words for
2On a standard benchmark (training on sections 1-18 of the
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and testing on sections 22-
24) our tagger achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.22%.

some POS tag categories. It is interesting to see that
there is overlap between the most frequent content
words across language boundaries. In general, func-
tion words are more frequent than content words,
resulting in somewhat less interesting examples for
some POS tags. More typical examples might be big
for adjectives, quickly for adverbs or read for verbs.
As suggested in Petrov et al. (2012), we train on
the language-specific treebank POS tags, and then
map the predicted tags to the universal tags. Table 3
shows POS tagging accuracies on the treebank eval-
uation sets using the 12 universal POS tags.
4.2 Syntactic Parsing
We use a dependency syntax representation, since
it is intuitive to work with and can be predicted ef-
fectively. Additionally, dependency parse tree cor-
pora exist for several languages, making the repre-
sentation desirable from a practical standpoint. De-
pendency parse trees specify pairwise relationships
between words in the same sentence. Directed arcs
specify which words modify a given word (if any),
or alternatively, which head word governs a given
word (there can only be one). For example, in Fig-
ure 2, hair is the head of the modifier short.
We use a deterministic transition-based depen-
dency parsing model (Nivre, 2008) with an arc-eager
transition strategy. A linear kernel SVM with the
following features is used for prediction: the part-
of-speech tags of the first four words on the buffer
and of the top two words on the stack; the word
identities of the first two words on the buffer and
of the top word on the stack; the word identity of
the syntactic head of the top word on the stack (if
available). All non-lexical feature conjunctions are
included. For treebanks with non-projective trees we
use the pseudo-projective parsing technique to trans-
form the treebank into projective structures (Nivre
and Nilsson, 2005). To standardize and simplify the
dependency relations across languages we use unla-
beled directed dependency arcs. Table 3 shows un-
labeled attachment scores on the treebank evaluation
sets with automatically predicted POS tags.
4.3 Syntactic Ngrams
As described above, we extract raw ngrams (n ? 5)
from the book text. Additionally, we provide ngrams
annotated with POS tags and dependency relations.
The syntactic ngrams comprise words (e.g.,
burnt), POS-annotated words (e.g. burnt VERB),
and POS tags (e.g., VERB ). All of these forms
can be mixed freely in 1-, 2- and 3-grams (e.g.,
the ADJ toast NOUN). To limit the combinatorial
explosion, we restrict the forms that can be mixed
in 4- and 5-grams. Words and POS tags cab be
mixed freely (e.g., the house is ADJ ) and we also
allow every word to be annotated (e.g., the DET
house NOUN is VERB red ADJ). However, we do
not allow annotated words to be mixed with other
forms (e.g., both the house NOUN is ADJ and
the house NOUN is red are not allowed). Head-
modifier dependencies between pairs of words can
be expressed similarly (we do not record chains of
dependencies). Both the head and the modifier can
take any of the forms described above. We use an
arrow that points from the head word to the modifier
word (e.g., head=>modifier or modifier<=head) to
indicate a dependency relation. We use the desig-
nated ROOT for the root of the parse tree (e.g.,
ROOT =>has).

the out-of-domain book data are likely lower.
Figure 2 shows an English sentence, its POS tags
and dependency parse tree, and some concrete ex-
amples of ngrams that are extracted. Note the flex-
ibility and additional possibilities that the depen-
dency relations provide. Using the raw ngrams it
is not possible to accurately estimate how frequently
hair is described as short, as there are often interven-
ing words between the head and the modifier. Be-
cause dependency relations are independent of word
order, we are able to calculate the frequency of both
hair=>black and hair=>short.
Similarly, there are many ways to express that
somebody is reading a book. The first plot in
Figure 3 shows multiple related queries. The 3-
gram read DET book aggregates several more spe-
cific 3-grams like read a book, read the book, etc.
The dependency representation read=>book is even
more general, enforcing the requirement that the two
words obey a specific syntactic configuration, but ig-
noring the number of words that appear in between.
5 Domain Adaptation
The results on the treebank evaluation sets need to
be taken with caution, since performance often suf-
fers when generalized to other domains. To get
a better estimate of the POS tagging and parsing
accuracies we conducted a detailed study for En-
glish. We chose English since it is the largest lan-
guage in our corpus and because labeled treebank
data for multiple domains is available. In addition to
the WSJ (newswire) treebank (Marcus et al., 1993),
we use: the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera,
1979), which provides a balanced sample of text
from the early 1960s; the QuestionBank (Judge et

al., 2006), which consists entirely of questions; and
the PPCMBE corpus (Kroch et al., 2010), which
contains modern British English from 1700 to 1914
and is perhaps most close to our application domain.
Since the English treebanks are in constituency
format, we used the StanfordConverter (de Marn-
effe et al., 2006) to convert the parse trees to de-
pendencies and ignored the arc labels. The depen-
dency conversion was unfortunately not possible for
the PPCMBE corpus since it uses a different set of
constituency labels. The tagset of PPCMBE is also
unique and cannot be mapped deterministically to
the universal tagset. For example the string ?one?
has its own POS tag in PPCMBE, but is ambigu-
ous in general ? it can be used either as a number
(NUM), noun (NOUN) or pronoun (PRON). We did
our best to convert the tags as closely as possible,
leaving tags that cannot be mapped untouched. Con-
sequently, our evaluation results underestimate the
accuracy of our tagger since it might correctly dis-
ambiguate certain words that are not disambiguated
in the PPCMBE evaluation data.
Table 4 shows the accuracies on the different do-
mains for our baseline and adapted models. The
baseline model is trained only on newswire text and
hence performs best on the newswire evaluation set.
Our final model is adapted in two ways. First, we
add the the Brown corpus and QuestionBank to the
training data. Second, and more importantly, we es-
timate word cluster features on the books data and
use them as features in the POS tagger.
The word cluster features group words determin-
istically into clusters that have similar distributional
properties. When the model encounters a word that
was never seen during training, the clusters allow the
model to relate it to other, potentially known words.
This approach improves the accuracy on rare words,
and also makes our models robust to scanning er-

rors. For example, in older books the medial-s (
?
)
is often incorrectly recognized as an ?f? by the OCR
software (e.g., ?beft? instead of ?best?). Such sys-
tematic scanning errors will produce spurious words
that have very similar co-occurrence patterns as the
correct spelling of the word. In fact, a manual exam-
ination reveals that words with systematic scanning
errors tend to be in the same cluster as their correctly
spelled versions. The cluster feature thus provides a
strong signal for determining the correct POS tag.
While the final annotations are by no means per-
fect, we expect that in aggregate they are accurate
enough to be useful when analyzing broad trends in
the evolution of grammar.
6 Conclusions
We described a new edition of the Google
Books Ngram Corpus that provides syntacti-
cally annotated ngrams for eight languages.
The data is available for download and view-
able through an interactive web application at
http://books.google.com/ngrams. We
discussed the statistical models used to produce the
syntactic annotations and how they were adapted to
handle historical text more robustly, resulting in sig-
nificantly improved annotation quality. Analyzing
the resulting data is beyond the scope of this paper,
but we show some example plots in Figure 3.
