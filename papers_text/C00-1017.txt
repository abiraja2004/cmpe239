Given the recent evidence for prot)abilistic 
mechanisms in models of hmnan aml)iguity res- 
olution, this paper investigates the plausibil- 
ity of exl)loiting current wide-coverage, 1)rob- 
al)ilistic 1)arsing techniques to model hmnan 
linguistic t)ert'orman(:e. In l)arl.i(:ulm ', we in- 
vestigate the, t)crforlnance of stan(tar(l stoclms- 
tic parsers when they arc revis(;(l to el)crate 
incrementally, and with reduced nlenlory re- 
sources. We t)resent techniques for ranking 
and filtering mlMyses, together with exl)erimen- 
tal results. Our results confirm that stochas- 
tic parsers which a(lhere to these 1)sy('hologi- 
cally lnotivated constraints achieve goo(l l)er- 
f()rman(:e. Memory cast t)e reduce(t (lown to 
1% ((:Oml)are(l to exhausitve search) without re- 
ducing recall an(l 1)rox:ision. A(lditionally, thes(; 
models exhil)it substamtially faster l)ertbrmance. 
FinMly, we ~rgue that this generM result is likely 
to hold for more sophisticated, nnd i)sycholin- 
guistically plausil)le, probal)ilistic parsing mod- 
els. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Language engineering and coml)ut~tional psy- 
cholinguistics are often viewed as (list|net re- 
search progrmnmes: engineering sohttions aim 
at practical methods which ('an achieve good 
1)erformance, typically paying little attention 
to linguistic or cognitive modelling. Comlm- 
tational i)sycholing,fistics, on the other hand, 
is often focussed on detailed mo(lelling of hu- 
man lmhaviour tbr a relatively small number 
of well-studied constructions. In this paper we 
suggest hat, broadly, the human sentence pro- 
cessing mechanism (HSPM) and current statis- 
ti(:al parsing technology can be viewed as having 
similar ol)jectives: to optimally (i.e. ral)idly and 
accurately) understand l;he text and utl;erances 
they encounter. 
Our aim is to show that large scale t)robabilis- 
tic t)arsers, when subjected to basic cognitive 
constraints, can still achieve high levels of pars- 
ing accuracy. If successful, this will contribute 
to a t)lausil)h; explanation of the fact th~tt I)(;() -
\])lc, in general, are also extremely accurate and 
rol)llS(;. Sllch a 1'o81111; Wollld also strellgthclt ex- 
isting results showing that related l)robal)ilistic 
lne('hanisms can exl)lain specific psycholinguis- 
tic phenomena. 
To investigate this issue, we construct a stan- 
dard 'l)aseline' stochastic parser, which mir- 
rors t;he pertbrmance of a similar systems (e.g. 
(,lohnson, 1998)). We then consider an incre- 
re(total version of th(', parser, and (;v~,htat(; tim 
etf'c(:ts of several l)rol)al)ilistic filtering strate- 
gies which m'e us(,(l to 1)rune the l)arser's earch 
space, and ther(;l)y r('(lu('(', memory load. 
rio &,,-;sess th(; generMity of oltr resnll;s for 
more Sol)histi(;ate(t prot)al)ilistic models, we also 
conduct experiments using a model in which 
parent-node intbrmation is encoded on the 
(laughters. This increase in contextual informa- 
tion has t)(;(;11 shown 1;o improve t)erforlnance 
(.Johnson, 1998), and the model is also shown 
to be rolmst to the inerementality and memory 
constraints investigated here. 
We present the results of parsing pertbr- 
mance ext)eriments , showing the accuracy of 
these systems with respect to l)oth a parsed 
corpus and the 1)aseline parser. Our experi- 
ments suggest hat a strictly incremental model, 
in which memory resources are substantially 
reduced through filtering, can achieve l)reci- 
sion and recall which equals that of 'unre- 
stricted' systems. Furthermore, implementa- 
tion of these restrictions leads to substantially 
faster 1)(;rtbrmance. In (:onchlsion, we argue 
that such 1)road-coverage probabilistic parsing 
111 
models provide a valuable framework tbr ex- 
plaining the human capacity to rapidly, accu- 
rately, and robustly understand "garden va- 
riety" language. This lends further supt)ort 
to psycholinguistic a counts which posit proba- 
bilistic ambiguity resolution mechanisms to ex- 
plain "garden path" phenomena. 
It is important to reiterate that our intention 
here is only to investigate the performance of 
probabilistic parsers under psycholinguistically 
motivated constraints. We do not argue for the 
psychological plausibility of SCFG parsers (or 
the parent-encoded variant) per se. Our inves- 
tigation of these models was motivated rather 
by our desire to obtain a generalizable result 
for these simple and well-understood models, 
since obtaining similar results for more sophisti- 
cated models (e.g. (Collins, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 
199711 might have been attributed to special 
properties of these models. Rather, the current 
result should be taken as support br the poten- 
tial scaleability and performance ofprobabilistic 
I)sychological models uch as those proposed by 
(aurafsky, 1996) and (Crocker and Brants, to 
appear). 
2 Psycholinguistic Mot ivat ion  
Theories of human sentence processing have 
largely been shaped by the study of pathologies 
in tnnnan language processing behaviour. Most 
psycholinguistic models seek to explain the d{f- 
ficulty people have in comprehending structures 
that are ambiguous or memory-intensive (see 
(Crocker, 1999) for a recent overview). While 
often insightflfl, this approach diverts attention 
from the fact that people are in fact extremely 
accnrate and effective in understanding the 
vast majority of their "linguistic experience". 
This observation, combined with the mounting 
psycholinguistic evidence for statistically-based 
mechanisms, leads us to investigate the merit of 
exploiting robust, broad coverage, probabilistie 
parsing systems as models of hmnan linguistic 
pertbrmance. 
The view that hmnan language processing 
can be viewed as an optimally adapted sys- 
tem, within a probabilistic fl'amework, is ad- 
vanced by (Chater et al, 19981, while (Juraf- 
sky, 19961 has proposed a specific probabilis- 
tic parsing model of human sentence process- 
ing. In work on human lexical category dis- 
ambiguation, (Crocker and Corley, to appear), 
have demonstrated that a standard (iimrmnen- 
tal) HMM-based part-of-speech tagger mod- 
els the finding from a range of psycholinguis- 
tic experiments. In related research, (Crocker 
and Brants, 19991 present evidence that an 
incremental stochastic parser based oll Cas- 
caded Markov Models (Brants, 1999) can ac- 
count tbr a range of experimentally observed 
local ambiguity preferences. These include 
NP/S complement ambiguities, reduced relative 
clauses, noun-verb category ambiguities, and 
'that'-ambiguities (where 'that' can be either a 
complementizer or a determiner) (Crocker and 
Brants, to appear). 
Crucially, however, there are differences be- 
tween the classes of mechanisms which are psy- 
chologically plausible, and those which prevail 
in current language technology. We suggest that 
two of the most important differences concern 
incrcmentality~ and memory 7vso'urces. There is 
overwhehning experimental evidence that peo- 
ple construct connected (i.e. semantically in- 
terpretable) analyses for each initial substring 
of an utterance, as it is encountered. That is, 
processing takes place incrementally, from left 
to right, on a word by word basis. 
Secondly, it is universally accecpted that peo- 
ple can at most consider a relatively small 
number of competing analyses (indeed, some 
would argue that number is one, i.e. process- 
ing is strictly serial). In contrast, many exist- 
ing stochastic parsers are "unrestricted", in that 
they are optinfised tbr accuracy, and ignore such 
t)sychologically motivated constraints. Thus the 
appropriateness of nsing broad-coverage proba- 
bilistic parsers to model the high level of hu- 
man performance is contingent upon being able 
to maintain these levels of accuracy when the 
constraints of" incrementality and resource limi- 
rations are imposed. 
3 Incremental Stochastic 
Context-Free Parsing 
The fbllowing assumes that the reader is fa- 
miliar with stochastic context-free grammars 
(SCFG) and stochastic chart-parsing tech- 
niques. A good introduction can be found, e.g., 
in (Manning and Schfitze, 19991. We use stan- 
dard abbreviations for terminial nodes, 11051- 
terminal nodes, rules and probabilities.

2. Fixed beam. Select a maximum number of

its prot)ability is not in the first m highest 
probabilities tbr edges with the same span. 
We pertbrmed exl)eriments using both types 
of beauls. Fixed beams yielded consistently bet- 
ter results than variable beams when t)lotting 
chart size vs. F-score. Thereibre, the following 
results are reported tbr fixed t)eams. 
We, compare and rank edges covering the 
same span only, and we rank active and inactive 
edges separately. This is in contrast to (Char- 
niak et al, 1998) who rank all edges. They 
use nornmlization in order to account tbr dif- 
ferent spans since in general, edges for longer 
spans involve more nmltiplications of t)robabil - 
ities, yielding lower probabilities. Charniak et 
al.'s normalization value is calculated by a dil- 
ferent probability model than the inside proba- 
bilities of the edges. So, in addition to the nor- 
malization for different span lengths, they need 
a normalizatio11 constant hat accounts tbr the 
different probability models. 
This investigation is based on a much simt)ler 
ranking tbrmula. We use what can be described 
as the unigram probability of a non-terminal 
node, i.e., the a priori prot)ability of the co l  
resl)onding non-ternlinal symbol(s) times the 
inside t)robat)ility. Thus, fi~r an inactive edge 
(i, j, X --> (~,/31(Xi,j)}, we use the l)rob~fl)ility 
Pm(X i , j )  = P (X)  . P ( tg . . . t j _ I IX )  (5) 
= 
for ranking. This is the prol)ability of the node 
and its yield being present in a parse. The 
higher this value, |;lie better is this node. flI is 
the inside probability for inactive edges as given 
in eqnation 2, P(X)  is the a priori probability 
tbr non-terminal X, (as estimated from the fre- 
quency in the training COrlmS) and Pm is the 
probability of the edge tbr the non-terminal X
spanning positions i to j that is used tbr rank- 
ing.

5 Exper iments  
5.1 Data  
We use sections 2 - 21 of the Wall Street Jour- 
lYecl)ank (Marcus el; al., nal part of' the Penn ~ " 
1993) to generate a treebank grammar. Traces, 
flmctional tags and other tag extensions that do 
not mark syntactic ategory are removed before 
training 3. No other modifications are made. For 
testing, we use the \] 578 sentences of length 40 
or less of section 22. The input to the parser is 
the sequence of i)art-ofspeech tags. 
5.2 Eva luat ion 
For evaluation, we use the parsewfi measures 
and report labeld F-score (the harmolfiC mean 
of labeled recall and labeled precision). R.eport- 
ing the F-score makes ore" results comt)aral)le to 
those of other previous experinmnts using the 
same data sets. As a n leasure  of  the an lount  
of work done by the parser, we report the size 
of the chart. The mnnl)er of active and imm- 
rive edges that enter the chart is given tbr the 
exhaustive search, not cored;lug those hypothet- 
ical edges theft are replaced or rejected because 
there is an alternative dge with higher t)roba- 
t)ility 4. For t)runed search, we give |:tie percent- 
age of edges required. 
5.3 F ixed Beam 
For our experiments, we define the beam by a 
maximunl number of edges per span. Beams 
for active and inactive edges are set separately. 
The Imams run from 2 to 12, and we test all 
2Here, we use proper prefixes, i.e., all prefixes not 
including the last element. 
aAs an example, PP-TMP=3 is replaced 173, PP. 
4The size of the chart is corot)arable to the "number 
of edges popped" as given in (Chanfiak et al, 1998).

chart stems from the parent hytmthesis in each 
node. In terms of pure node categories, the av- 
erage number of parallel nodes at this point is 
3.5 7 . 
Exhaustive search for the base encoding needs 
in average 140,000 edges per sentence, tbr tile 
parent encoding 200,000 edges; equivalent re- 
sults for the base encoding can be achieved with 
around 1% of these edges, equivalent results tbr 
the parent encoding need between 2 and 3%. 
The lower mmlber of edges significantly in- 
creases parsing speed. Using exhaustive search 
tbr the base model, the parser processes 3.0 to- 
kens per second (measured on a Pentium III 
500; no serious efforts of optimization have gone 
into the parser). With a chart size of 1%, speed 
is 630 tokens/second. This is a factor of 210 
without decreasing accuracy. Sl)eed for the par- 
ent model is 0.5 tokens/second (exhaustive) and 
111 tokens/seconds (3.0% chart size), yielding 
an improvement by factor 220. 
6 Related Work 
Probably mostly related to the work reported 
here are (Charniak et al, 1998) and (Roark and 
Johnson, 1999). Both report on significantly 
improved parsing efl:iciency by selecting only 
subset of edges tbr processing. There are three 
main differences to our at)t)roach. One is that 
they use a ranking fbr best-first search while 
we immediately prune hypotheses. They need 
to store a large number edges because it is not 
known in advance how maw of the edges will be 
used until a parse is found. Tile second differ- 
ence is that we proceed strictly incrementally 
without look-ahead. (Chanfiak et al, 1998) 
use a non-incremental procedure, (Roark and 
Johnson, 1999) use a look-ahead of one word. 
Thirdly, we use a much simpler ranking tbnnula. 
Additionally, (Chanfiak et al, 1998) and 
(Roark and Johnson, 1999) do not use the 
original Penntree encoding tbr the context-fl'ee 
structures. Betbre training and parsing, they

rability to our results. 
Tile heavy restrictions in our method (imme- 
diate pruning, no look-ahead, very simple rank- 
ing formula) have consequences on the accuracy. 
Using right context and sorting instead of prun- 
ing yields roughly 2% higher results (compared 
to our base encodingS). But our work shows 
that even with these massive restrictions, the 
chart size can be reduced to 1% without a de- 
crease in accuracy when compared to exhaustive 
search. 
7 Conclusions 
A central challenge in computational psycholin- 
guistics is to explaiu how it is that people are 
so accurate and robust in processing language. 
Given the substantial psycholinguistic evidence 
tbr statistical cognitive mechanisms, our objec- 
tive in this paper was to assess the plausibility 
of using wide-coverage probabilistic parsers to 
model lmman linguistic performance. In par- 
ticular, we set out to investigate the effects of 
imposing incremental processing and significant 
memory limitations on such parsers. 
The central finding of our experiments i that 
incremental parsing with massive (97% - 99%) 
pruning of the search space does not impair 
the accuracy of stochastic ontext-free parsers. 
This basic finding was rotmst across different 
settings of the beams and tbr the original Penn 
Treebank encoding as well as the parent encod- 
ing. We did however, observe significantly re- 
duced memory and time requirements when us- 
ing combined active/inactive dge filtering. To 
our knowledge, this is the first investigation on 
tree-bank grammars that systematically varies 
the beam tbr pruning. 
Our ainl in this paper is not to challenge 
state-of-the-art parsing accuracy results. For 
our experiments we used a purely context-ti'ee 
stochastic parser combined with a very sim- 
ple pruning scheme based on simple "unigram" 
probabilities, and no use of right context. We 
do, however suggest hat our result should ap- 
ply to richer, more sophistacted probabilistic 
SComparison of results is not straight-forward since 
(Roark and Johnson, 1999) report accuracies only tbr 
those sentences for which a parse tree was generated (be- 
tween 93 and 98% of the sentences), while our parser 
(except for very small Imams) generates parses for vir- 
tually all sentences, hence we report; accuracies for all 
sentences.
