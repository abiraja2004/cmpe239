Abstract
In this paper we propose a new distance
function (rank distance) designed to reflect
stylistic similarity between texts. To assess
the ability of this distance measure to cap-
ture stylistic similarity between texts, we
tested it in two different machine learning
settings: clustering and binary classifica-
tion.
1 Introduction
Computational stylistics investigates texts from the
standpoint of individual style (author identifica-
tion) or functional style (genres, registers). Be-
cause in all computational stylistic studies / ap-
proaches, a process of comparison of two or more
texts is involved, in a way or another, there was
always a need for a distance function to measure
similarity (more precisely dissimilarity) of texts
from the stylistic point of view. Such distance
measures were proposed and used for example in
authorship identification (Labb?e and Labb?e, 2001;
Burrows, 2002) or clustering texts by genre (Luy-
ckx et al, 2006).
In this paper we propose a new distance mea-
sure designed to reflect stylistic similarity between
texts. As style markers we used the function word
frequencies. Function words are generally con-
sidered good indicators of style because their use
is very unlikely to be under the conscious con-
trol of the author and because of their psycholog-
ical and cognitive role (Chung and Pennebaker,
2007). Also function words prove to be very effec-
tive in many author attribution studies. The nov-

elty of our approach resides in the way we use
information given by the function word frequen-
cies. Given a fixed set of function words (usually
the most frequent ones), a ranking of these func-
tion words according to their frequencies is built
for each text; the obtained ranked lists are subse-
quently used to compute the distance between two
texts. To calculate the distance between two rank-
ings we used Rank distance (Dinu, 2003), an ordi-
nal distance tightly related to the so-called Spear-
man?s footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977).
Usage of the ranking of function words in the
calculation of the distance instead of the actual val-
ues of the frequencies may seem as a loss of infor-
mation, but we consider that the process of rank-
ing makes the distance measure more robust acting
as a filter, eliminating the noise contained in the
values of the frequencies. The fact that a specific
function word has the rank 2 (is the second most
frequent word) in one text and has the rank 4 (is
the fourth most frequent word) in another text can
be more relevant than the fact that the respective
word appears 349 times in the first text and only
299 times in the second.
To assess the ability of this distance function to
capture stylistic similarity between texts, we tested
it in two different machine learning settings: clus-
tering and binary classification.
Compared with other machine learning and sta-
tistical approaches, clustering was relatively rarely
used in stylistic investigations. However, few re-
searchers (Labb?e and Labb?e, 2001; Luyckx et al,
2006) have recently proved that clustering can be
a useful tool in computational stylistic studies.
Apart of this, clustering is a very good test bed for
a distance measure behavior. We plugged our dis-
tance function into a standard hierarchical cluster-
ing algorithm and test it on a collection of 21 nine-
91
teenth century English books (Koppel et al, 2007).
The results are very encouraging. The family trees
produced grouped together texts according to their
author, genre, even gender.
Also a distance measure can be used to solve
classification problems if it is coupled with proper
learning algorithm. One of the simplest such algo-
rithms is nearest neighbor classification algorithm.
We chose nearest neighbor algorithm because its
performance is entirely based on the appropriate-
ness to the data of the distance function on which it
relies. In this way the accuracy of the classification
will reflect the adequacy of the distance measure to
data and domain on which the method was applied.
We used the new distance function in conjunction
with nearest neighbor classification algorithm and
tested it on the well known case of authorship of
disputed Federalist papers. The method attributed
all disputed papers to Madison, the result being
consistent with that of Mosteller and Wallace.
To check if the usage of ranks of function words
is better suited for capturing stylistic differences
than the usage of actual frequencies of the function
words, we repeated the above experiments on clus-
tering and binary classification with the standard
euclidean distance between the vectors of frequen-
cies of the same function words that were used in
computing the rank distance. The comparison is in
favor of rank distance.
2 Rank Distance and Its Use as a Stylistic
Distance Between Texts
Rank distance (Dinu, 2003) is an ordinal met-
ric able to compare different rankings of a set of
objects. It is tightly related to the Spearman?s
footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977), and it had
already been successfully used in computational
linguistics, in such problems as the similarity of
Romance languages (Dinu and Dinu, 2005).
A ranking of a set of n objects can be repre-
sented as a permutation of the integers 1, 2, . . . , n,
? ? S
n
. ?(i) will represent the place (rank) of the
object i in the ranking. The Rank distance in this
case is simply the distance induced by L
1
norm:
D(?
1
, ?
2
) =
n
?
i=1
|?

(i)? ?

(i)| (1)
This is a distance between what is called full rank-
ings. However, in real situations, the problem of
tying arises, when two or more objects claim the
same rank (are ranked equally). For example, two
a been had its one that was
all but has may only the were
also by have more or their what
an can her must our then when
and do his my shall there which
any down if no should things who
are even in not so this will

at for is of such up would
be from it on than upon your
Table 1: Function words used in computing the
distance
or more function words can have the same fre-
quency in a text and any ordering of them would
be arbitrary.
The Rank distance allocates to tied objects a
number which is the average of the ranks the tied
objects share. For instance, if two objects claim the
rank 2, then they will share the ranks 2 and 3 and
both will receive the rank number (2+3)/2 = 2.5.
In general, if k objects will claim the same rank
and the first x ranks are already used by other ob-
jects, then they will share the ranks x + 1, x +
2, . . . , x + k and all of them will receive as rank
the number:
(x+1)+(x+2)+...+(x+k)
k
= x+
k+1
2
. In
this case, a ranking will be no longer a permutation
(?(i) can be a non integer value), but the formula
(1) will remain a distance (Dinu, 2003).
Rank distance can be used as a stylistic distance
between texts in the following way:
First a set of function word must be fixed. The
most frequent function words may be selected or
other criteria may be used for selection. In all our
experiments we used the set of 70 function words
identified by Mosteller and Wallace (Mosteller and
Wallace, 1964) as good candidates for author-
attribution studies. The set is given in Table 1.
Once the set of function words is established,
for each text a ranking of these function words is
computed. The ranking is done according to the
function word frequencies in the text. Rank 1 will
be assigned to the most frequent function word,
rank 2 will be assigned to the second most frequent
function word, and so on. The ties are resolved as
we discussed above. If some function words from
the set don?t appear in the text, they will share the
last places (ranks) of the ranking.
The distance between two texts will be the Rank
distance between the two rankings of the function
words corresponding to the respective texts.
3 Clustering Experiments
One good way to test the virtues of a distance mea-
sure is to use it as a base for a hierarchical cluster-

Table 2: The list of books used in the experiment
ing algorithm. The family trees (dendogram) thus
obtained can reveal a lot about the distance mea-
sure behavior.
In our experiments we used an agglomerative hi-
erarchical clustering algorithm (Duda et al, 2001)
with average linkage.
In the first experiment we cluster a collection
of 21 nineteenth century English books written by
10 different authors and spanning a variety of gen-
res (Table 2). The books were used by Koppel et
al. (Koppel et al, 2007) in their authorship verifi-
cation experiments.
The resulted dendogram is shown in Figure 1.
As can be seen, the family tree produced is a very
good one, accurately reflecting the stylistic rela-
tions between books. The books were grouped
in three big clusters (the first three branches of
the tree) corresponding to the three genre: dramas
(lower branch), essays (middle branch) and novels
(upper branch). Inside each branch the works were
first clustered according to their author. The only
exceptions are the two essays of Emerson which
instead of being first cluster together and after that
merged in the cluster of essays, they were added
one by one to this cluster. Apart of this, the family
tree is perfect. Even more, in the cluster of novels
one may distinguished two branches clearly sepa-
rated that can correspond to the gender or national-
ity of the authors: female English (lower part) and
male American (upper part).
For comparison, the dendogram in Figure 2
show the same books clustered with the same al-
gorithm, but using the standard euclidean distance
instead of the rank distance as measure of stylis-
tic similarity. The same set of function words as
in the case of rank distance was used. This time
though, each text was represented as a vector of

glish books (Rank Distance)

glish books (Euclidean Distance)

relative frequencies of these function words in the
text. The relative frequency of a particular func-
tion word in a text is calculated as the number of
appearances of the respective function word in the
text divided by the length (in tokens) of the text.
The distance between two texts is given by the eu-
clidean distance between the corresponding vec-
tors of relative frequencies of function words. In
the family tree obtained using euclidean distance,
most of the books are still grouped according to
their author, but the distinct clusters corresponding
to genre and gender disappeared and the novels of
Melville were separated: one being clustered with
the essays of Thoreau (Moby Dick) and the other
with the novels of Hawthorne.
4 Binary Classification Experiments
When a distance measure is available, the most
natural choice of a classification algorithm is the
nearest neighbor algorithm (Duda et al, 2001).
We tested the nearest neighbor classification al-
gorithm combined with both rank distance and eu-
clidean distance on the case of the 12 disputed fed-
eralist papers (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964). In
our experiments we followed the Mosteller and
Wallace setting, treating the problem as a binary
classification problem. Each one of the 12 dis-
puted papers has to be classified as being written
by Hamilton or Madison. For training are used the
51 papers written by Hamilton and the 14 papers
written by Madison.
Tested on disputed papers, the nearest neighbor
classification algorithm combined with rank dis-
tance attributed all the 12 papers to Madison. This
matches the results obtained by Mosteller and Wal-
lace and is in agreement with today accepted thesis
that the disputed papers belong to Madison. When
the nearest neighbor classification algorithm was
combined with euclidean distance only 11 papers
were attributed to Madison, the paper 56 was at-
tributed to Hamilton.
5 Discussion
In this paper we have proposed a new distance
measure based on the ranking of function words,
designed to capture stylistic similarity between
texts. We have tested it in two different machine
learning settings: clustering and binary classifica-
tion; we have compared its performance with that
of standard euclidean distance on vectors of fre-
quencies of the function words. Though testing on
more data is needed, the initial experiments shown
that the new distance measure is indeed a good in-
dicator of stylistic similarity and better suited for
capturing stylistic differences between texts than
the standard euclidean distance.
In future work it would be useful to test this dis-
tance measure on other data sets and especially in
other machine learning paradigms like one-class
classification to solve authorship verification prob-
lems (Koppel et al, 2007).
