was made un o f  comnlete  fo rms  : the  work ing

than  that  o f  a syntact i ca l  narser .  
2 .3 .  Syntact i ca l  ana lvs i s  
The Aup-mented Transit ion Network (ATN) was 
selected for the ana\]ysis : it had success- 
fully been used in many nrevious systems : 
I,UNAi~, SH!~DLII, \]INTEI,I,\]iC, T and, more recently, 
ENFISPAN (Leon, 1984). T. ~'~\]no~rad nresents 
three networks in great detail  in his boo\]< 
'Lan~ua9e as a Cognit ive Process' (Winograd, 
1983). These were taken as the basis for 
the four (Sentence, Noun Phrase, Prenosit io-  
nal Phrase and Adjectival  Phrase) of the nro- 
totyDe, thus makin~ it nossible to sneed un 
the develonment of a narser which had alrea- 
dy nroved itself in other resnects. 
The major i ty  of the modi f icat ions made to 
the  \ ]~r ino~rad 's  ATN were  a imed at  inc reas in~ 
i t s  ner fo rmance  (esnec ia \ ] l y  bv dea l in~ w i th  
the  most  common cases  o f  coord inat ion)  as  
we l l  as  i t s  determin is t  canac i t ies  thereby  
ensur ing ,  the  accuracy  o f  the  in i t ia l  ana ly -  
s i s  sunn l ied  by  the  sys tem ( i t  :is ill fac t  on 
th i s  ana lys i s  that  the  t rans fer  operates  be -  
cause  the  mic ro -comnuter ' s  memory  was  satura -  
643 
ted before it had managed to supply all pos- 
sible analysis). 
2.4. Disambiguat ion 
Within the prototype framework, the creation 
of a disambiguat ion sub-component would have 
taken up too much time and would not have be- 
en useful part icular ly that this research is 
del iberately designed to apply to only a li- 
mited corpus in which most of the ambigui- 
ties concern the Preposit ional Phrase attach- 
ment and need not be solved for the transla- 
tion if English into French. 
2.5. Source-Language dict ionary 
For the various reasons explained above, the 
dict ionary includes only complete forms. 
All variable words are character ised by dif- 
ferent syntactical :features, certain of 
which concern their form, others do not. 
All of these are treated by the analysis com- 
ponent. Semantic features could easily be 
added at a later stage. 
Words forming certain 'traditiona\]' classes 
may belong to various categories of the ~ro- 
totype dictionary. This is notably the case 
with cardinal adjectives, which are at once 
classif ied as determiners and substantives. 
At present, the only compounds that the pro- 
totype dict ionary accepts are locutions with 
a maximum of two consecutive words. Longer 
locutions, compound verbs and other disconti- 
nuous compounds~ quite rare in the corpus, 
will be treated as follows at a later sta~e: 
all words liable to appear in compounds will 
be tagged with a nointer to this effect, to 
enable the preprocessing sub-comnonent to de- 
termine whether a compound or simple form is 
present in a given text. 
Numbers were not introduced into the prototy- 
pe dictionary. The parser would accent them 
if a routine were created that would automa- 
tical ly attribute noun and determiner catego- 
ries to them. 
3. "Transfer" component 
The transfer component deals with the re- 
sults obtained by the analysis component. 
3.1  . S t ruc tura l  t rans fer  
By deal ing<with the structural transfer 
first, one is saved, notably, from having to 
waste time translating forms that will duly 
be dropped (such as 'will'), since the adap- 
tation to tense in French is done along with 
the structural transfer. 
The structural transfer operates on the sen- 
tence as a whole, on various levels. It on- 
ly saves those results of the analysis that 
are pert inent for the generation. 
3.1 .1 .  Sentence 
The various constituent elements of the clau- 
644 
se are rewritten so as to conform to the fol- 
lowing seauence : 
(Pass ive)  + (Negat ive)  + Ro le  + NPl  + Auxi- 
l iaries + Verb  + (NP2)  + (NP3)  + PP 
NPI is the deep subject of the clause, NP2 
is the direct 'object (the attr ibute or even 
nothin~ at all if the main verb is of the 
'be' type) and NP3 is the indirect object. 
All nass\]ve clauses are out into the active 
voice durlnv the analysis and structural 
transfer. These are the transformations 
that, where necessary, regain the passive 
voice in the process of generation into 
French. 
3.1.2. Noun Phrase 
Three  rewr i tes  a re  poss ib le  fo r  the  noun 
phrase  : 
- Number  + Pronoun 
- DNP ( 'dummy NP ' )  
- Number  + ( (Determiner )  + Noun + (Ad jec t ive)  
+ (Noun)  + (PP)  + (S ) )  
The rewrite elements are derived from vari- 
ous registers of the analysis result. 
3.1.3. Verb Phrase 
By Verb Phrase is understood here the Auxi- 
l iary together with the Main Verb. This in- 
volves 'Auxiliary' in its widest sense, that 
is compris ing all that precedes the verb : 
tcnse (present, inf init ive and/or imperfect), 
modal i ty and even person. It should be no- 
ted that only third person forms appear in 
the corpus studied. 
The verb phrase rewrites itself extensively 
in the fol lowing manner : 
(Infinitive) + Present/ Imperfect  + 3rd.n + 
(Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + (Modal) + 
(Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + Verb 
To arrive at this rewrite, many rules that 
combine together are brought into play for 
various reasons concerning, notably, the mul-  
tiple feature categories, the treatment of 
'be', 'dummy be' and .'dummy modal'.  
3.2. Transfer dict ionary 
In En~l\]sh as in other languages, a word may 
belon~ to several grammatical categories 
('all' is at once adverb, determiner and pro- 
noun) or, indeed, the same form may have va- 
rious dimensions ('read' has the features of 
infinitive, present (except for the 3rd per- 
son in the singular), and past as well as 
past participle).  Besides, one word in Eng- 
lish may have several possible translat ions 
in French. For these reasons, it seemed con- 
venient to create a transfer dict ionary si- 
tuated in between source and target language 
dict ionaries in order to avoid excessive mul- 
t ipl icat ion of relat ionships and also to fa- 
ci l i tate the extension of the system to o- 
ther language pairs. 
Unlike the English terms which are in the 
d ic t ionary  in  a complete  fo rm,  the i r  F rench  
t rans la t ions  a re  presented  in  canon ica l  fo rm.  
3 .3 .  Lex ica l  t rans fer  
Lex ica l  t rans fer  operates  d i rec t ly  a f te r  the  
s t ruc tura l  t rans fer .  At  the  moment ,  i t  i s

4. "Generat ion"  component  
The generat ion  or  synthes i s  takes  p lace  in  
two s tages  : the  syntact i ca l  generat ion  i s  
fo l lowed by  the  morpho log ica l  generat ion .  
Both  o f  these  s tages  re fe r  to  data  :from the  
ta rget - language d ic t ionary  as  we l l  as  f rom 
the  common data  poo l .  
The generat ion  in  F rench  i s  insp i red  by the  
ru les  o f  ( :homsk ian  generat ive  and  t rans forma-  
t iona l  g rammar ,  spec i f i ca l l y  as  p resented  in  
the  work  o f  C. N ique  (N ique ,  1978) .  
Most  o f  the  o ther  g rammat ica l  theor ies  cur -

4 .1 .  Target -Language d ic t ionary  
In  the  ta rget - language d ic t ionary ,  the  d i f fe -  
rent  : features  a l low ing  :for the  agreement  o f  
the  canon ica l  : forms must  be added to  the  va -  
r ious  grammatical  categories. 
A common data pool is associated with this 
dict ionary. This enables one to conjugate 
the verbs correct ly  (root table and conjuga- 
tion table), lit also contains the different 
forms of the determiners and their condit i -  
ons of usage. 
4.2. Syntactical  Generat ion  
The generat ion is carr ied out by means of 
transformations.  Below are presented those 
transformations that have a fundamental role 
in the elaborat ion of the structure of the 
sentence in French and in the ordering of 
i t s  te rms .  Others  d i rec t ly  concern  the  mor -  
pho logy  o f  the  words ,  and  are  out l ined  br ie f -  
l y  la te r  on .  
In  accordance  w i th  the  theory  o f  generat ive  
and  t rans format iona l  g rammar ,  t rans format i -  
ons  occur  in  an  order ly  manner  in  an  ascen-

Transformat ion of Subordination, which cor- 
rectly :inserts the subordinate clauses :
