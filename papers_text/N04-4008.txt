Abstract 
We propose a method of automatically con-
structing an English-Chinese bilingual Fra-
meNet where the English FrameNet lexical 
entries are linked to the appropriate Chinese 
word senses. This resource can be used in ma-
chine translation and cross-lingual IR systems. 
We coerce the English FrameNet into Chinese 
using a bilingual lexicon, frame context in 
FrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet. 
Our approach does not require any manual 
mapping between FrameNet and HowNet 
semantic roles. Evaluation results show that 
we achieve a promising 82% average F-
measure for the most ambiguous lexical 
entries.  
1 Introduction 
Since the early 90?s, automatic alignment of bilingual 
documents and sentences based on lexical and syntactic 
information has been a major focus of the statistical 
NLP community as their results are a valuable resource 
for statistical machine translation, cross-lingual question 
answering, and other bilingual or cross-lingual tasks. 
Recently, there has been an increasing trend of using 
semantic information for these tasks spurred by the 
availability of various ontology databases such as 
WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, etc. Among these, the 
Berkeley FrameNet database is a semantic lexical re-
source consisting of frame-semantic descriptions of 
more than 7000 English lexical items, together with 
example sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker 
et al, 1998). The current version of FrameNet has been 
applied successfully to English question answering sys-
tems (Gildea, 2002). However, the manual development 
of FrameNet in other languages has been on a small 
scale (e.g. German, Spanish, Japanese) or unfinished 
(e.g. Chinese). Since manually annotation is rather time 
consuming, the main objective of our work is to auto-
matically create multilingual FrameNet to enable se-
mantic analysis in multiple languages rather than in 
English. Another objective is to quantify the mapping 
between semantic structures across language pairs for 
statistical NLP systems. Our basic idea is to coerce the 
English FrameNet into another language using existing 
semantic resources and a bilingual lexicon. Our initial 
target language is Chinese. However, we expect that our 
technique is applicable to other languages as well. There 
are two Chinese semantic resources available today--
Cilin (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2) (Mei et al, 1982) and 
HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000). Much like WordNet, 
Cilin is a thesaurus with a hierarchical structure of word 
clusters, but it does not describe any semantic relation-
ship between words and categories. HowNet, on the 
other hand, is an ontology with a graph structure of in-
ter-concept relations and inter-attribute relations. In 
addition, HowNet has been widely used in resolving 
NLP problems, such as word sense disambiguation 
(Dang et al, 2002) and machine translation (Dorr et al, 
2002). For our work, we choose to align HowNet con-
cepts to lexical entries in FrameNet in order to construct 
the English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet.   
 
(Dorr et al, 2002) describes a technique for the con-
struction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on 
HowNet and an English verb database called the LCS 
Verb Database (LVD). They created links between Chi-
nese concepts in HowNet and English verb classes in 
LVD using both statistics and a manually constructed 
?seed mapping? of thematic classes between HowNet 
and LVD. Ngai et al (2002) employed a word-vector 
based approach to create the alignment between Word-
Net and HowNet classes without any manual annotation. 
In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach to 
create links between FrameNet semantic frames and 
HowNet concepts. We also plan to release an on-line 
demonstration for the community to access the bilingual 
FrameNet we built. 
2 FrameNet and HowNet 
FrameNet and HowNet are ontologies with different 
structures and different semantic role/relation defini-
tions. FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries 
grouped by frame semantics. Each lexical entry repre-
sents an individual word sense, and is associated with 
semantic roles and some annotated sentences. Lexical 
entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a 
?frame? and the semantic roles are called ?frame ele-
ments?. For example: 
 
Frame: Cause_harm 
Frame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event, in-
strument, iterations, purpose, reason, result, victim?.. 
Lexical Entries in ?cause_harm? Frame: 
bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v, bludgeon.v, 
boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v, burn.v,?. 
An annotated sentence of lexical entry ?beat.v?:  
[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him] 
[means with my fists].  
 
HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of 
word senses called ?concepts?, and each concept con-
tains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-
lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English, 
and a definition of the concept including its category 
and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000). For 
example, one translation for ?beat.v? is ?: 
NO. = 17645 
W_C =? 
G_C =V 
E_C =~??~??~??~???~??~??~?? 
W_E=attack 
G_E=V 
E_E= 
DEF=fight|?? 
 
Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to Fra-
meNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not cor-
respond directly to FrameNet semantic roles. 
3 Construction of the English-Chinese Bi-
lingual FrameNet  
(Dorr et al 2002) uses a manual seed mapping of se-
mantic roles between FrameNet and LVD. In this paper, 
we propose a method of automatically linking the Eng-
lish FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet concepts, re-
sulting in a bilingual FrameNet. We make use of two 
bilingual English-Chinese lexicons, as well as HowNet 
and FrameNet. In the following sections 3.1 to 3.3, we 
use an example FrameNet lexical entry ?beat.v? in the 
?cause_harm? frame to illustrate the main steps of our 
algorithm in Figure 1. 
For each lexical entry l in FrameNet 
    Find translations T1 of l in HowNet translations. 
    Find translations T2 of l in LDC dictionary. 
    Combine the T1 and T2 together as T. T= T1?T2 
Link l to all HowNet concepts LC whose W_C field   
is in T. LC= {c|c.W_C ? T}, c is any HowNet  
concept. 
For each frame F in FrameNet  
Group all the HowNet concepts together FC which  
are linked to the lexical entries in F. FC= {c|  
link(c,l)=true and l ? F}. 
    Compute the frequency of HowNet categories in FC. 
Select the top 3 HowNet categories as valid  
categories VA for frame F. 
For each HowNet categories a  
  If the similarity score between a and one of the top  
  3 categories is greater than threshold t. Sim(a, ta) > 
  t, ta is any of the top 3 categories. 
          Add a into VA. VA = VA?{a}. 
    For each lexical entry l in frame F 
         For each HowNet concept c linked to l 
              If the categories of c is not in VA 
prune this link.

 3.1 Baseline mapping based on bilingual lexicon  
We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and LDC 
dictionary to first create all possible mappings between 
FrameNet lexical entries and HowNet concepts whose 
part-of-speech (POS) tags are the same. Here we as-
sume that syntactic classification for the majority of 
FrameNet lexical entries (i.e. verbs and adjectives) are 
semantically motivated and are mostly preserved across 
different languages. For example ?beat? can be trans-
lated into {?, ?, ??, ??, ??, ??, ?, ?
??} in HowNet and {?, ??, ?, ??, ??} in 
the LDC English-Chinese dictionary.   ?beat.v? is then 
linked to all HowNet concepts whose Chinese 
word/phrase is one of the translations and the part of 
speech is verb ?v?.  Figure 2 shows some examples of 
HowNet concepts that are linked to ?beat.v?.

HowNet concepts with 144 candidate links 
 
3.2 Disambiguation by semantic contexts in both 
languages  
At this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has links to 
multiple HowNet concepts and categories. For example, 
?beat.v? in ?cause_harm? frame is linked to ??? in 
both the ?beat? category and the ?associate? category 
(as in????/make a phone call?). We need to choose 
the correct HowNet concept (word sense). Many word 
sense disambiguation algorithms use contextual words 
in a sentence as disambiguating features. In this work, 
we make use of contextual lexical entries from the same 
semantic frame, as illustrated below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To disambiguate between the above two candidate cate-
gories, we make use of the other lexical entries in 
?cause_harm?, such as ???, and their linked categories 
in HowNet, such as ?beat? again. Each target HowNet 
category receives a vote from the candidate links. In our 
example, ?beat? receives two votes (from ??? and from 
???), and ?associate? only one (from ???). We choose 
the HowNet category with the most votes and its con-
stituent concepts to be the valid word sense links to the 
source FrameNet lexical entry. Consequently, ?beat.v? 
in ?cause_harm? is linked to all HowNet concepts that 
are translations of ?beat? which are verbs, and which 
also belong to the HowNet category ?beat? (vs. ?associ-
ate?).  
Figure 3. Disambiguating HowNet candidates for 
?beat.v? with 42 candidate links 
 
 
In our example, Figure 3 shows the top 14 examples of 
HowNet concepts belonging to two HowNet catego-
ries??beat? and ?damage? that are linked to the 
?cause_harm? frame in FrameNet. Only the concepts in 
the top N categories are considered as correctly linked 
to the lexical entries in the ?cause_harm? frame. We 
heuristically chose N to be three in our algorithm. 
3.3 Compensating links by HowNet taxonomy struc-
ture 
Using frame context alone in the above step can effec-
tively prune out incorrect links, but it also prunes some 
correct links whose HowNet categories are not in the 
top three categories but are similar to them. In this next 
step, we aim to recover this kind of pruned links. We 
introduce the category similarity score, which is based 
on the HowNet taxonomy distance (Liu and Li, 2002):  
Sim(category1,category2) = 
+d
?
?  
Where d is the path length from category1 to category2 
in the taxonomy. ? is an adjusting parameter, which 
controls the curvature of the similarity score. We set 
?=1.6 in our work following the experiment results in  
(Liu and Li, 2002). If the similarity of category p and 
one of the top three categories is higher than a threshold 
t, the category p is also considered as a valid category 
for the frame. 
 
In our example, some valid categories, such as ?firing|
??? is not selected in the previous step even though it 
is related to the ?cause_harm? frame. Based on the 
HowNet taxonomy, the similarity score between ?firing|
??? and ?beat|?? is 1.0, which we consider as high.  
Hence, ?firing|??? is also chosen as a valid category 
and the concepts in this category are linked to the 
?beat.v? lexical entry in the ?cause_harm? frame. How-
ever, using taxonomy distance can cause erros such as 
? in the ?weave? category to be aligned to ?beat.v? in 
the ?cause_harm? frame.

4 Evaluation   
We evaluate our work by comparing the results to a 
manually set golden standard of links for the most am-
biguous lexical entries in FrameNet, and use the preci-
sion and recall rate as evaluation criteria. To show the 
lower bound of the system performance, we chose six 
FrameNet lexical entries with the most links to HowNet 
concepts as the test set. Since each link is a word sense, 
these lexical entries have the most ambiguous transla-
tions.  Such lexical entries also turned out to be mostly 
verbs. Since the number of lexical entries in a FrameNet 
parent frame (i.e. frame size) is an important factor in 
the disambiguation step, we analyze our results by dis-
tinguishing between ?small frame?s (a frame with less 
than 5 lexical entries) and ?large frame?s. 24% of the 
frames are ?small frames?. Results in Tables 2 and 3 
have a weighted average of 
(0.649*0.24+0.874*0.76)=82% F-measure.

5 Conclusion and Discussion  
The alignment results can be found at 
http://www.cs.ust.hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet. Our evaluation 
shows that our method has achieved an 82% average F-
measure in aligning the most ambiguous FrameNet lexi-
cal entries to HowNet concepts. This paper describes 
the first stage in our project towards creating a bi-
lingual English-Chinese FrameNet, by aligning lexical 
entries between FrameNet and HowNet. The next step is 
to automatically extract semantically annotated Chinese 
sentences based on the annotated English sentences in 
FrameNet, the aligned FrameNet lexical entries, and 
bilingual corpora. We expect the final bilingual Frame-
Net will provide a valuable resource for multi-lingual or 
cross-lingual natural language processing.
