Abstract 
Recently, language barrier becomes the 
major problem for people to search, retrieve, 
and understand WWW documents in 
different languages. This paper deals with 
query translation issue in cross-language 
information retrieval, proper names in 
particular. Models for name identification, 
name translation and name searching are 
presented. The recall rates and the 
precision rates for the identification of 
Chinese organization ames, person names 
and location names under MET data are 
(76.67%, 79.33%), (87.33%, 82.33%) and 
(77.00%, 82.00%), respectively. In name 
translation, only 0.79% and 1.11% of 
candidates for English person names and 
location names, respectively, have to be 
proposed. The name searching facility is 
implemented on an MT sever for 
information retrieval on the WWW. Under 
this system, user can issue queries and read 
documents with his familiar language. 
Introduction 
World Wide Web (WWW) is the most useful 
and powerful information dissemination system 
on the Internet. For the multilingual feature, 
the language barrier becomes the major problem 
for people to search, retrieve, and understand 
WWW documents in different languages. That 
decreases the dissemination power of WWW to 
some extent. The researches of cross-language 
information retrieval abbreviated as CLIR (Oard 
and Dorr, 1996; Oard 1997) aim to tackle the 
language barriers. There are several important 
issues in CLIR: 
232 
(1) Queries and documents are in different 
languages, o that translation is required. 
(2) Words in a query may be ambiguous, thus 
disambiguation is required. 
(3) Queries are usually short, thus expansion 
is required. 
(4) Word boundary in queries of some 
languages (Chen and Lee, 1996) is not 
clear, thus segmentation is required. 
(5) A document may be in more than one 
language, thus language identification is 
required. 
This paper focuses on query translation issue, 
proper name in particular. 
The percentage of user queries containing 
proper names is very high. The paper 
(Thompson and Dozier, 1997) reported an 
experiment over periods of several days in 1995. 
It showed 67.8%, 83.4%, and 38.8% of queries 
to Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, and 
Washington Post, respectively, involve name 
searching. In CLIR, three tasks are needed: 
name identification, ame translation, and name 
searching. Because proper names are usually 
unknown words, it is hard to find in 
monolingual dictionary not to mention bilingual 
dictionary. Coverage is one of the major 
problems in dictionary-based approaches 
(Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Davis, 1997; Hull 
and Grefenstette, 1996). Corpus-based 
approaches (Brown, 1996; Oard 1996; Sheridan 
and Ballerini, 1996) set up thesaurus from large- 
scale corpora. They provide narrow but 
specific coverage of the language, and are 
complementary to broad and shallow coverage 
in dictionaries. However, domain shifts and 
term align accuracy are major limitations of 
corpus-based approaches. Besides, proper 
names are infrequent words relative to other 
content words in corpora. In information 
retrieval, most frequent and less frequent words 
are regarded as unimportant words and may be 
neglected. 
This paper will propose methods to extract 
and classify proper names from Chinese queries 
(Section 1). Then, Chinese proper names are 
translated into English proper names (Section 2). 
Finally, the translated queries are sent to an MT 
sever for information retrieval on the WWW 
(Bian and Chen, 1997). The retrieved English 
home pages are presented in Chinese and/or 
English. 
1 Name Extraction and Classification 
People, affairs, time, places and things are five 
basic entities in a document. If we can catch 
the fundamental entities, we can understand the 
document to some degree. These entities are 
also the targets that users are interested in. 
That is, users often issue queries to retrieve such 
kinds of entities. The basic entities often 
appear in proper names, which are major 
unknown words in natural language texts. 
Thus name extraction is indispensable for both 
natural anguage understanding and information 
retrieval. 
In famous message understanding system 
evaluation and message understanding 
conferences (MUC) and the related multilingual 
entity tasks (MET), named entity, which covers 
named organizations, people, and locations, 
along with date/time xpressions and monetary 
and percentage expressions, is one of tasks for 
evaluating technologies. In MUC-6 named 
entity task, the systems developed by SRA 
(Krupka, 1995) and BBN (Weischedel, 1995) on 
the person name recognition portion have very 
high recall and precision scores (over 94%). 
In Chinese language Processing, Chert and 
Lee (1996) present various strategies to identify 
and classify three types of proper nouns, i.e., 
Chinese person names, Chinese transliterated 
person names and organization names. In 
large-scale xperiments, the average precision 
rate is 88.04% and the average recall rate is 
92.56% for the identification of Chinese person 
names. 
The above approaches can be employed to 
collect Chinese and English proper name sets 
from WWW (very large-scale corpora). 
Identification of proper names in queries is 
different from that in large-scale texts. The 
major difference is that query is always short. 
Thus its context is much shorter than full texts 
and some technologies involving larger contexts 
are useless. The following paragraphs depict 
the methods we adopt in the identification of 
Chinese proper names. 
A Chinese person name is composed of 
surname and name parts. Most Chinese 
surnames are single character and some rare 
ones are two characters. A married woman 
may place her husband's urname before her 
surname. Thus there are three possible types of 
surnames, i.e., single character, two characters 
and two surnames together. Most names are 
two characters and some rare ones are one 
character. Theoretically, every character can 
be considered as names rather than a fixed set. 
Thus the length of Chinese person names range 
from 2 to 6 characters. Three kinds of 
recognition strategies shown below are adopted: 
(1) name-formulation statistics 
(2) context cues, e.g., titles, positions, 
speech-act verbs, and so on 
(3) cache 
Name-formulation statistics form the baseline 
model. It proposes possible candidates. The 
context cues add extra scores to the candidates. 
Cache records the occurrences of all the possible 
candidates in a paragraph. If a candidate 
appears more than once, it has high tendency to 
be a person name. 
Transliterated person names denote foreigners. 
Compared with Chinese person names, the 
length of transliterated names is not restricted to 
2 to 6 characters. The following strategies are 
adopted to recognize transliterated names: 
(1) character condition 
Two special character sets are setup. 
The first character of transliterated names 
and the remaining characters must belong 
to these two sets, respectively. The 
character condition is a loose restriction. 
The string that satisfies the character 
condition may denote a location, a 
building, an address, etc. It should be 
employed with other cues (refer to (2)- 
(4)). 
(2) titles 
Titles used in Chinese person names are 
233 
also applicable to transliterated person 
names. 
(3) name introducers 
Some words can introduce transliterated 
names when they are used at the first 
time. 
(4) special verbs 
The same set of speech-act verbs used in 
Chinese person names are also used for 
transliterated person names. 
Cache mechanism is also helpful in the 
identification of transliterated names. A 
candidate that satisfies the character condition 
and one of the cues will be placed in the cache. 
At the second time, the cues may disappear, but 
we can recover the transliterated person name by 
checking cache. 
The structure of organization ames is more 
complex than that of person names. Basically, 
a complete organization name can be divided 
into two parts, i.e., name and keyword. 
Organization names, country names, person 
names and location names can be placed into the 
name part of organization names. Person 
names can be found by the approaches specified 
in the last paragraph. Location names will be 
touched later. Transliterated names may 
appear in the name part. We use the same 
character sets mentioned in the last paragraph. 
If a sequence of characters meet the character 
condition, the sequence and the keyword form 
an organization ame. Common content words 
may be inserted in between the name part and 
the keyword part. In current version, at most 
two content words are allowed. Besides, we 
utilize the feature of multiple occurrences of 
organization ames in a document and propose 
n-gram model to deal with this problem. 
Although cache mechanism and n-gram use the 
same feature, i.e., multiple occurrences, their 
concepts are totally different. For organization 
names, we are not sure when a pattern should be 
put into cache because its left boundary is hard 
to decide. 
The structure of location names is similar to 
that of organization names. A complete 
location name is composed of a person name (or 
a location name) and a location keyword. For 
the treatment of location names without 
keywords, we introduce some locative verbs. 
Cache is also useful and N-gram model is 
employed to recover those names that do not 
meet he character condition. 
We test our system with three sets of MET 
data (i.e., MET-1 formal run, MET-2 training, 
and MET-2 dry run). The recall rates and the 
precision rates for the identification of Chinese 
organization ames, person names and location 
names are (76.67%, 79.33%), (87.33%, 82.33%) 
and (77.00%, 82.00%), respectively. 
2 Proper Name Translation 
Chinese and English are the source language and 
the target language, respectively, in our query 
translation. The alphabets of these two 
languages are totally different. Wade-Giles 
(WG) and Pinyin are two famous systems to 
romanize Chinese (Lu, 1995). The proper 
name translation problem can be formulated as: 
(1) Collect English proper name sets from 
WWW. 
(2) Identify Chinese proper names from 
queries. 
(3) Romanize the Chinese proper names. 
(4) Select candidates from suitable proper 
name sets. 
In this way, the translation problem is 
transferred to a phonic string matching problem. 
If an English proper name denotes a Chinese 
entity, e.g., Lee Teng-hui denotes " - ~ "  
(President of R.O.C.), the matching is simple. 
Otherwise, the matching is not trivial. For 
example, we issue a query "F*q~'-~.~d~" in
Chinese to retrieve information about Alps. 
The Pinyin romanization of this name is 
a.er.bei.si.shan ~. The string "aerbeisishan" is 
not similar to the string "alps". We develop 
several anguage models incrementally to tackle 
the translation problem. The first issue we 
consider is how many common characters there 
are in a romanized Chinese proper name and an 
English proper name candidate. Here the order 
is significant. For example, the Chinese query 
is ' J~$ .~-~' .  Its WG romanization is 
'ai.ssu.chi.le.ssu'. The corresponding proper 
name is Aeschylus. Three characters (shown 
as follow in underline) are matched in order: 
I The dot is inserted among romanization of Chinese 
characters for clear reading. Later, the dot may be 
dropped when strings are matched. 
234 
aeschylus  
a is  suchi lessu 
We normalize it by the length of the candidate 
(i.e., 9), and get a score 0.33. In an experiment, 
there are 1,534 pairs of Chinese-English person 
names. We conduct a mate matching: to use 
each Chinese proper name as a query, and try to 
find the corresponding English proper name 
from the 1,534 candidates. The performance is 
evaluated in such a way that how many 
candidates hould be proposed to cover the 
correct ranslation. In other words, the average 
rank of correct translations is reported. The 
performances of the baseline model under WG 
and Pinyin systems are 40.06 and 31.05, 
respectively. The major problem of the 
baseline model is: if a character is matched 
incorrectly, those characters that follow this 
character will not contribute to the matching. 
In the above example, chi ( '~, ') will be helpless 
for translation. 
For reducing the error propagation, we 
consider syllables of the candidate in advance. 
The matching is done in syllables instead of the 
whole word. For example, Aeschylus contains 
three syllables. The matching is shown as 
follows: 
aes chy lus 
a issu chi lessu 
The score is increased to 0.67 (6/9). In the 
similar experiment, the performances of the new 
language model are improved. The average 
ranks are 35.65 and 27.32 for WG and Pinyin 
systems, respectively. 
Observing the performance differences 
between WG and Pinyin systems, we find they 
use different phones to denote the same sounds. 
The following shows examples: 
(1) vowels 
p vs. b, t vs. d, k vs. g, ch vs. j, ch vs. q, 
hs vs. x, ch vs. zh, j vs. r, ts vs. z, ts vs. c 
(2) consonants 
-ien vs. -ian, -ieh vs. -ie, -ou vs. -o, 
-o vs. -uo, -ung vs. -ong, -ueh vs. -ue, 
-uei vs. -ui, -iung vs. -iong, -i vs. -yi 
A new language model integrates the 
alternatives. The average ranks of the mate 
match is 25.39. The result is better than those 
of separate romanization systems. 
In the above ranking, each matching character 
is given an equal weight. We postulate that the 
first letter of each Romanized Chinese character 
is more important than others. For example, c
in chi is more important than h and i. Thus it 
should have higher score. The following 
shows a new scoring function: 
score=Zj(f/*(eli/(2 * cli)+0.5)+o,*0.5)/el 
where 
el: length of English proper name, 
eli: length of syllable i in English proper name, 
cli: number of Chinese characters correspond- 
ing to syllable i, 
f~: number of matched first-letters in syllable i, 
oi: number of matched other letters in syllable i. 
We reduplicate the above example as follows. 
The first letter is in capital. 
aes chy lus 
AiSsu Chi LeSsu 
The corresponding parameters are listed below: 
e1/=3, c11=2, fj=2, o1=0, el=9, 
el2=3, ci2=1, fe=l, o5=1, 
eis=3, cls=2, t"3=2, os=0. 
The new score of this candidate is 0.83. Under 
the new experiment, he average rank is 20.64. 
If the first letter of a Romanized Chinese 
character is not matched, we give it a penalty. 
The average ranks of the enhanced model is 
16.78. 
Table 1. The Performance of Person Name 
Translation I I 524 497 107 143 44 22 197 
We further consider the pronunciation rules in 
English. For example, ph usually hasfsound. 
If all the similar rules are added to the language 
model, the average rank is enhanced to 12.11. 
Table 1 summarizes the distribution of ranks of 
the correct candidate. The first row shows the 
range of ranks. The second row shows the 
number of candidates within the range. About 
one-third have rank 1. On the average, only 
0.79% of candidates have to be proposed to 
cover the correct solution. It shows this 
method is quite effective. 
We also make two extra experiments. Given 
a query, the best model is adopted to find 
English locations. There are 1,574 candidates 
in this test. The average rank is 17.40. In 
other words, 1.11% of candidates have been 
235 
proposed. If we merge the person name set and 
location set, and repeat the experiment, the 
performance drops to 27.70. It tells us the 
importance of classification of proper names. 
Conclusion 
This paper proposes knowledge from character, 
sentence, and paragraph levels to identify 
different kinds of proper names. The person 
name translation problem is formulated as a 
phonic string matching problem. We consider 
the length of matching characters, syllables, 
different romanization systems, pronunciation 
rules, positive and negative scores in ranking. 
The name searching mechanism is integrated 
into a Chinese-English information retrieval 
system. In this way, languages are transparent 
to users on the Internet. In current 
implementation, only 0.79% and 1.11% of 
candidates for English person names and 
location names, respectively have to be proposed 
during name translation. 
This model can be employed to set up a 
bilingual proper name dictionary. We can 
collect English and Chinese proper names from 
Internet periodically, and then conduct a mate 
matching. Human can be involved to select he 
correct ranslation. That will reduce the cost to 
develop a large scale bilingual proper name 
dictionary for name searching.
