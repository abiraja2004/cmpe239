The last formal level o f  representation in this system is 
called a l o g i c a l  form. The b a s ~ c  method of evaluation of 
logical forms is the generate  and t e s t "  paradigm, used, f o r  
q ~ & n p l s  in the  L U N A R  system (Woods, Kaplan and Nash-Webber,

in order t e  be j ~ a c t i c a l  on a moderate size d a t a  base.  The

Operat ion of the  re-evaluation function. Pre-evaluation 
is accomplished by  a funct io l i  EVALUA., which t a k e s  a l o g i c a l

The EvQluatox? 
For the most part ,  e v a l u a % i o n  of loQica1 forms is q u i t e  
straightforward. H i d d e n  semantic e f f ec t s  are discussed in 
the n e x t  s e c t k o n ;  here we are mainly  concerned w i t h  
computat ion .  
Each i n s t a n c e  of s e t x  searchgs the l4st  of 
variable-candidate s e t  pairs to f i n d  t h e  c a n d ~ d a t e  s e t  
a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  i t s  own v a r i a b l e  and s u b s t i t u t e s  the members  
of the set f a r  the v a r i a b l e  one b y  one i n t o  ~ t s  a s s o c i a t e d  
p r e d i c a t e .  Those members of the c a n d i d a t e  s e t  fox which the 
predicate eva luates  to true are p l a c e d  in the solutlon s e t .  
Operat ion of the quant i f i er  p r e d i c a t e s  is similar to t h a t  0 3  
s e t x ,  e x c e p t  t h a t ,  as  in Figure 5, ~t may be necessary to 
eva luate  an instance of s e t x  to find t h e  domain of the 
qua'ntif ication v a r i a b l e . .  
Evaluation of the ~ t h e r  predicates consists simply of 
applying a coz~esponding L I S P  function to t h e  arguments. 
Sometimes the final f a g i c a l  form t o  be e v a l u a t e d  bears no 
o b v i o u s  relation t o  the input ques t i . on ,  a s  in Figure 8 .  The

ABSTRACT 
We describe the continuation of an earlier b70rk on the 
prbblm of lexical coverage. The objective is to prove 
experimentally certain mathematical conjectures concerning t h e  
relationshi? between the sizes of the covering and covered sets 
of words, an&-- maximun lenqth of dictionary def in i t ions .  The 
data base on which the experiments are cerried sut bas been also 
extended t6 the full contents -of an existinq dictionary of 
computer terminology. The rwults of the previous and present 
work lay the foundqtions for quantitative studies on lexical 
valence and its relation to the frequency of usage and other 
pr inc ip les  ofb ditztionary selection. 
Besides t h e  inherent interest in t-hese investigations , the 
concepts dealt with and the methods of cgantifying dictionary 
variables may eventually lead to more' efficient dictionaries with 
respect to precision, compactness, and computer time andmemory 
needed for processing.

First, we shall introduce the problem define same basic 
terms and provide a brief historical account of pi(st results. In 
order t o  rendter t h i s  paper fiairly self-sufficient, @ brief 
sunwry o f  th& previous work, Flndler Viil (1974) , %"ill af  so 
have t o  be giken. 
A mono1 ingual dictionary may be considered economical and 
efficient if a mall set of words are used to def ine  a relatively 
large set o f  entties. Quantitative information as to what size 
vocabulary is needed to cover a given number of entries is very 
scarce and may be characterized by two "data points*: 
The New Method Enalish Dictionary published by N.P. B e s t  and 
J.G. Endicott in 1961 uses 1,490 self-defined basic words to 
explain some 10,000 words and 6,000 idioms, i .e .  about 24,000 
expressions, Thus, the size ra t io  is 0.062. 
Oqien's Basic Engl i sh ,  published in 1933, involves 850 
English words and 50 !!internationaly words t o  defihe 20,OOu 
EnglTsh words. The ratio of the covering and covered set sizes 
is 0.045. 
The basis of selection was the Wusefulness" of the  words 
employed in the def in i t ions ,  as opposed to  the  freouencg of their 
occurrence in some standard texts.  Howelvet , neither this concept 
nor other principles  of selection suggested by o t h e r  researchers 
have ever been quantitatively analyzes and made use of. We  hall 
discuss these issues later on. 
In order to approach the problem in definite terns, Findler 
( 1 970) considered three basic variables : 
(i) the c~ver inp  set ,  I R t  qf sfze vR, 
- 
(ii) the covered set ,  - S, of s i z e  us, 
- 
(iii) the  maximum fief i n i t i o n  leffpth, -I N such that each word 
in I) S can be def ined hy a t  most - N ordered words from - R.
The t a s k  was formulated t o  f ind  
(4 v, as a fpnct ion  of vS at different parmetric values 
- - 
of N, and 
I
(b) V~ a s  a function of - P.r a t  different parametric Values 
Cal l inu  AvR/AvS increment ratio and vR/vS size rat io,  the 
following cbn) ectures vere made concernina the f Srst task : 
(a l )   he , increment ratio is, in general, less than one. 
(a2) The increment ratio, in general, decreases as vs 
increases , 
(a3) For larue constant values or Nt vR - approaches a 
-
l imitin? value asvmptotically as vs increasep. 
(a4) The increme& ratio never exceeds the size ratio. 
Two points need to b e n o t e d  in this connection. An excep- 
t i o n  co rules ( a l )  and (a21 would occur in a dictionary system, 
whi'ch does not treat polysemous words or homonyms as individual  
entries, every t i m e  a new word with many meanings or homonyms~ i.s 
introduced into the covered set, Second, the cited case is an 
exception to ruie (a l )  but not to (a4) . When N=1, the covering 
and the covered se ts  are of the same s i z e ,  i . e ,  botn the incre-  
ment ra'tio and the size batio equal one, However, not every word 
is defined By itself only .  If a new word is introquced that.  al- 
ready has a synbonm in the coverihg set,  it will be def ined  by 
that synonym. In t h i s  caser the increment r a t i o  is 0 and the size 
ratio becomes less than 1 .  (This will be clear w i t h  the descrip- 
t i o n  of the data base construction on page 11.) 
For the seoond general task,  (b) t h e  followinq 
conjectures were also mads: 
( b l )  vR monotonically decreases aer I N rncreases. 
(b2) For any f ixed value of vS, vR asymptoticallv 
- - 
a~pfoaches a lower l i m i t  as - N increases a h o u t  bound. 
~ f t  seems reasonable to state $n a nual i tat ive  sense that in 
the process of aenerating a dictionarJl ~maller vR values mean 
- 
smaller storage remirements whereas smaler I N values t d  to 
reduce processinp time and output volume. In order t p  answer the 
question "What are t h e  optirum Hlues of vR and - N for a given vs 
- - 
for a certain (family of) conmuter applications on a machine w i t h  
a given cost structure?' one hlts to consider the interrelation 
of the above three bas ic  variables and to compute three entitles: 
t h e  semantic index (raughlv, the n w e f  of different meanings1 of 
the elements in t h e  covered set ,  t h e  lexical  valence (roughly 
t h e  capahilitv substituted for another the 
elements in the coverincr set,  and the f w y e n c y  of dccurence of 
. 
the elements of bath aeta.  Quantitative invest2gations of t h e  
l a s t  three dictionary variables are planned to follou! t h e  
present, second stage of our study, 
THE DATA BASE AND THE PRWRA' 
We have e ~ t e n d e d  the data base used in our preaious work, 
Findler and V i i l  (1.974). The whole contents of the alcwonary on 
computer technalooy, Chandar (1970) , is now included in t h e  
presenr study. Its structure, cathex simple and unif  arm, is 
described below. First, same ereneral pr inc ip les  of data hase 
constructiop are outlined. 
Evew element of the covereg set is considered a s ingle  
lexical item, regardless of the number of words the o r i ~ i n a l  
dictionary entry consiats of. Also. each word J.s coded as a 
striha of a t  moat 10 characters (containable in one CDC Cyber 
computer word). The abbrevhtians ere still easy to *ad with 
relatively short practice. 
Only the dominant meanincj bf poJgsemous terms was dea l t  
with. Each entrv .\ has thus one meaning and one def in i t ion .  
Termr in the definit ions (elements of the coverfng set) are 
also qonsidored l e x i c a l  items, L e .  even multiword entl.t~es 
appear as a sfnple  un i t  and are represented by at most 10 
characters, 
The bas ic  vocabulary, that is the covering set,  consist^ of 
elements tha.t also appeap i n  thq pvered set-. In our particular 
case, they are non-technical words used t o  aefine the technical  
t e n s  of t-he computer dictiwanfi. d e f i n i t e  d i s t i n c t i o n  was 
made between content wbras and functiqn words (also called 
operators), The latter were not bnclud&d in the covefing set nor 
were they counted in determining the length of definit ions.  
Hence, eh* covaring Set conbists only  of content words. 
The function words indicate grammatical and loaical 
relationships between the words contributing t o  the content. 
They belong to 17 categories: 
1)  prepositions, o.a. of, &, E: 
2 )  conjulllctions, e.p. and, - -r or - if; 
3) the relative pronoun which; -

Actually,  the E ~ c t i o n  words byere r c ~ l a c e d  hy code numbers 
in the dictionary. The code numhers were assigned consecutively 
as the funct ion wards-evere needed durincr t h e  conqtructian of t h e  
e t a  base so that the order is puxelv random. A complete l ist o f

 he oriqinal de f in i t i ons  were oarnewhat silnplif  i e d  and 
qtandazdized. In this process, articles were omitted (many 
languaces do very well without them). On tffe other hand, 
imp l i c i t  relationships were made explicik, NOWS are represented 
in singular, thus avoid in^ another dictionary entrv f a r  plural 
or, what would be worse, prourasmnina a mcrrammnr". Likewise. 
f d i n i t e  verb f o m  are represented in t h i r d  person plural pre'sent 
iddicativs active. FNddinu the t h i r d  person singular eliminates, 
another  dietianary en try ,  and avoiding thg nassive voice 
eliminates a great manv part ic ip les ,  which otherwise ulould have 
had* to be entered. Of course, present .and past participles ( t h e  
former identical t o  gerund in farm) could no t  always be avoided 
and had to he entered in the  dict ionary where needed. Auxiliary 
verbs vere automatically eliminated by avoiding gompound tenses 
and the passive voice. Fina l ly ,  *to don associated with neaationp 
was sim~ly omitted. 
Some examples dl1 make the encodina process clear.

The data, base was constructed by selecting the f irst  entry, 
then e n t e r i n g  a l l  the lex ical  items in its definition, subsequent- 
ly enter inq  a l l  the lexical items in t h e  definitions of t h e s e ,  
etc. Words t h a t  were not defined in Zhe o r i g i n a l  d i c t i ona ry  were 
entered and defined hv themselves; they consti tute the b a s i c  
vocabulary. This procedure was continued until everythhff was 
defined,  i.e. u n t i l  all t h e  terms in t h e  coverina se t  were also 
irr the covered set .  Then the next e n t r y  was selected from the 
dictionary, ah8 the above process was repeated. -. 
The dictionary was arranged in the form pf a SLIP l ist,  
~ i n d l e r  et al (1 971) . Cvery en t ry  (element of the covered set) 
occupies four cells in this list: ( 1 )  enkrv word - (as

i n i t i o n  length (an inteqer) , ( 3 )  type of entry (an integer) , (4 )

Three types of entries were distinguished for programming 
convenience : I 
1 )  code 0 indicates  t h a t  the e n t r y  i k s e l f  is not used in 
any definition i , e ,  i;t occuxs o n l y  in the  covered set  and

2) c o d a 1  i n a i g a t e s  t h a t  t he  e n t r y  occurs i n  both Sets and 
is not an element of the basic vocabulary; 
3 )  code 2 indicates  that t h e  entry is deiiined by iteelf, 
i . e .  it belongs to t H e  basic vocabulary.

That computers and linguists meet, for the host part ,  only in the skill 
sorne~hat evotic f ie ld of computational linguistics is $ sad statement about 
the st2te of ordinary linguistic research The titre bhen computers were to 
be considered only the too l  of the natural scientist or the statist$cally 
minded social s c i e q t i s t  i s  long past, 'word processing technology' is now 
the specialty of a growing number of computer companies Not only can this  
techrology be of great value i n  reducing the clerical burden of the linguigt 
and linguistics student, but, iiinguists, as specialists who have been studying 
and manipulating language far years, are in  a position t o  be contributing to 
this  f i e ld  Jn fact, in many areas of linguistic research the analysis of 
particular languages, the search for li~rgui&tic universal s, the analysis  of 
discourse and text, computar technology can bc of help tc the l i n g u i s t ,  and, 
in many subfields of computer science automated lnngua~e processing, the 
deslgn of human/machme i ~ t e r f ~ c e s ,  the structuring of data bases,  linguistics 
has much to offer the ccnnputer scientist, vet up until how, relatively few 
such cross contributions have been made Computer scientists have been slow 
to discgvei the v d u e  of Ilnguistirs to their w o r ~ ,  the tine has come for 
linguists t o  take the initiitivc and to  train themselves (and their students) 
to hake use of and contribute to the field of computer science, 
Speci?lized traltning in the us& of t he  corrputer with-ln a particular 
discipline is not new Students i n  mary soclal sciences nok f lnd themselves 
facing Lncreaslng pressure and rnanaatorf rcquirnQents to take c o ~ p t s r  training 
wlth in  the* department, f i f l g h i ~ t i c s  is, In fact, unusual III not having such 
requirements or even oppur t u n i t i e s  A t  a time wnen graduating l inguis t i c s

Today, in  most u n f v e r s i t i ~ ,  coaput41,g is  dvililable t o  linguistics 
departments only through the  use o f  a l a rge ,  cen t r a l  un ivers i ty  computer which 
is expected t o  he of aervice  to  a l l  univers i ty  departments. But, as  computer 
casts continue t o  f a l l ,  and, as l a r s e  computing cen te rs  continue t o  be 
unresponsive to  the needs of t h e i r  new users ,  i t  w i l l  not  be qneammon t o  f ind

available4or a l i n g u i s t i c s  department crying t o  equip i t s e l f  today? 
My Bnswer is structured, to some extent ,  by the organization bf  language 
It is widely understood, even by non-s t ra t i f ica t ional  l i n g u i s t s ,  t h a t  the  
facu l ty  of language is based on a s t ack  of s t ructured systems, each one building 
a la rge  number of u n i t s  above from a smaller number below, i,e a handful of 
phonetic fea tures  combine t o  form less than f i f t y  phonemic segments which 
combine t o  form thousands of morphemes,tens or hundreds of thousands of 
words, an i n f i n i t e  number of sentences and texts expressing countless ideas 
and concepts It w i l l  not  be surpr i s ing  t o  f ind t h a t  as one climbs t h i s  
&tack, from phonology upward, the  amount of computing powet needed t o  perform 
useful  t a sks  and research increases i n  proportion t o  the increasing number 
of u n i t s  and the  complexity of t h e i r  s t ruc tur ing  I w i l l  concernmyself ,  
mostly, w i th  the p o s s i b i l i t i e s  ava i l ab l e  for  the study of the  lower l e v e l s  
This PB because the  type of linguistic work being done i n  t he  study of the  
semantic and cognit ive levels is s t i l l  primarily research and the  people 
involved ere more l i k e l y  t o  already know t h e i r  needs and options as far as 
computing goes Also, s ince  t h e  cost of computing i n  these  areas  is somewhat 
higher,  it is less l i k e l y  t ha t  department& w i l l  be doing their own purchasing 
f o r  these  purposes 
HARDWARE FOR T)IE PHONOLOGIST 
The 8tudent of phonology, morphology and l i n g u i s t i c  f f e l d  ana lys i s  is 
concerned .,primarily with the manfpulation of l i n g u i s t ~ c  t e x t ,  expressed as a 
series o t  phonemic symbols o r  blokks of phonetic f e a t u r e s .  f i e  task i s  t o

p a r t i c u l a r  meaning and segment the  text i n t o  these i d e n t i f i e d  subs t r ings  As 
new substrings aft fdentif ied, the t e x t  is ofttn rewr i t t en  with o new orgcx~izatlofi 
based on new understandings, so as t o  improve the  chances oP f idding new 
~ubsttings, f i e l d  workers often use index cards for t h i s  purpose Problem 
after problem is solved in this way, with a pot insignificant amount of time 
being spent i n  the reorganizing and tecopying stages I t  is  a tedidus business 
because it is t ery mechanical In fact, efficient computer algoritllms tor 
doing much of thq job already e x i s t  and have been implemented on nedrly a l l  
computers in the form of t e x t  e d i t o m  The task 1$ relatively simple and even 
the smallest computer available can do an adequate job 
A l inguist ics  department intcrested %n providing its students ~ i t h  training 
in the use of computers for th i s  kind of work (and they w i l l  become standard 
toola for the purpose very soon) would do w e l l  to purchase as many (one or 
more) identicdl, small (hobbyist s i z e )  computers aq it can afford For 
educational purposes, the very snalles t microcomputers, equipped d i t h  qodest 
~ s s  storage devices, such as tape cassettes o r  floppy d i s c s ,  are j bs t  f ine 
Assignments i n  classes can be distributed on departmentally owned or student 
owned tapes or discs (less that  $10 each) These can be automatically duplioated 
just as assignments are nov mimeographed, they are reuseable and usually 
Contain enough room t o  store several assignments, including the partial 
results &tom day t p  da and f inal  so lut ions  For larger, research sized 
projects, involving d o t  of te l t ,  or more complicntcd analyses, suuh as 
automated analysis of phonof ogical tactics, the f a s t e a t  microcomputers, with 
larger mass storage devices, might be more appropriate 
(Imlicit in the discussion of these types of machines f a  the fact ths t  
student use of them is via Bh interactive terminal Microcamputers are not 
typical ly  operated i n  'batch mode', and no benefit could be derived from 
doing l inguis t ic  analysis in anv but an interactive mode of operation ) 
Whi nl~crocomputers and associated memories are relatively inexpensive, 
l inguists  have a genuine need for sophisticated input and output d~vfces which 
arq somewhat more expensive Standard coaputer terminals generally provlde 
a l l  md only the characters available on a typewriter keyboard, some provide 
only upper case letters What is needed is a terminal with the sme capabilities 
9s the s e l e c t r i c  s t y l e  typewriter one with changeable type fonts ,  including the 
standard phonetic symbol alphabet, yith diacritics CRT terminals' (cathode 
ray tuber terminals) can provide this type'of operation more cheapty, more 
relkably, and more flexibly than printing terminals (there is no need to stop 
and change type fonts) CRT terminals which support user designed type fonts 
are available, arid in fact, may be the only ones on which the standard phonetic 
alphabet can be cu~rently supplied These terminals at2  somewhat expensive 
(apveral thousand dollqrs each), but since they are very flexiblel and often 
I 
support some degree of computer gtaphics d i sp lay  as well ad haung che 
potential to d i s p l a y  texts written i n  any language, they are vahuable 
educational taolc 
If all or most o f  the termint\le i n  a department are CRT type termlnala, 
i t  w i l l  be necessary to  provide some means of producing 'hard copy' output 
on paper While most interactions with a computer can take p l a c e  on a screen, 
some record of the resu l t s  of a session will be needed for study and evaluation 
Printers which can handle the fhexible type fonts needed by l ingu i s t s  are 
available They are fast  they operate in  the dame way that copyillg wachines 
work and simply transfer the contents of the CRY screen to the paper (including 
graphic materials) They are expensive However, a small department mlght 
well f i n d  that only one of these printers is  necessary t o  meet their n&ds, 
the results of ~ o r k  done on any of the snal l  microcomputers could b e  moved 
(either over cormbunication lines or carried on a disc or tape) t o  the printer 
with l i t t l e  or no delay 
H N U ) \ J M  FOR THE G W W . ' I A , Y  
Syntax is ,  perhaps, the most widely studied sub J ect i n  l inguist ics  today 
Given that t h i s  is so, there ig a real need for linguists, both profess$onal 
and student, to understand the extreme d i f f i c u l t y  of the  task of writing 
a grammar for a language That attempts are made to do this without the aid 
of a computer is perhaps a l l  the evidence one needs to  see that the diff iculties 
are not well understood. A formal granmar, particularly one written in  
the notations commonly used today, is very much like a computer progrm It 
is a l i s t  of instruct ions  for generating a list o f  strings, a computer program 
is a l i s t  of instruct ions  for performing some process (which might be 
generating a list of strings) Both need to be precise, both are very complex, 
both suffer from the fact that a change i n  one part of the ordered l ist may 
cause an unanticipated change in  the effect of another part It would be 
very surprising to f ind  that l ingu i s t s  were better a t  producing untested, yet 
correct, #formal charac'terizations of complex processes than computer 
programmers I eXpect that testing a newfy written gtammar w i l l  be as 
enlightening as experience far a lihguisaics student as debugging a new 
codolex program is for a gompuer science student,  
Furthennore, just as the computer is sf uae i n  studying phonology and 
morphology, i t  can also o f f e r  d a t a  organizat ion s e r v i c e s t t o  a i d  i n  the  study 
of syntax Automated t a c t i c  a n a l y s i s  of syntax is still a research  p r o j e c t ,

P 13 B L I S H E R: THE PRESS AT TWIN \I'ILLOWS 
May 23, 19743 
To h a p  hobbyists, householders. businesses, and 
government keep up with the c~untless vendors who offer 
hardware and software in the microcomputer market, THE PRESS 
at Twin Willows will begin i m e d i p t e l y  to col lect  and 
publish evaluative, analytic reviews, according to David 
G. Hays, Publisher. 
"When the computing market was dominated by j u s t  a few 
big  companies," Hays says, "it was f a i r l y  easy t o  decide how 
to handle a computing problem. Once a buyer had settled on 
a computing budget, the market might offer only two o r  thtee 
main frames big enough and cheap enough to do the  job .  Now 
the buyer can design a machine to f i t  a~purpose, and 'has to 
choose components o u t  of lists that run up t o  dozens of 
alternatives. The worst part is, no one publishes th@ list!" 
THE PRESS intends to correct part of the problem by 
making useful information about the market available in easy 
language and inexpensive format. "Before long," Hays expects 
th.e hardware and software reviews will be accessible online 
f o r  clients 60 dial  in. 11 
Where will the reviews come from? THE PRESS invites any 
user of any microhardware or software to write it up; the 
- more - 
From THE PRESS at Twin Willows - !lay 23, 1978 72 
editors at THE PRESS will rewrite if necessary, make sure 
that the evaluations are not illegally harsh, and eliminate 
the most obvious errors. No fees are offered to reviewers 
at present, but a change is contemplated. "Everyone who 
helps should be paid," as Hays puts it. 
Manufacturers and software houses can send their lists 
and item descriptions to be included with the evaluations. 
THE PRESS, tvhich will also publish original material in 
whatever technical fields need i t s  services, is "mostly a 
method," Hays says.  Its purpose is to teach information 
users how to cooperate with each o the r ,  making central 
publishing f ess relevant. 
Hays, who is setting up THE PRESS, is a professor of 
linguistics and of computer science in the State University 
of New York at Buffalo. He moved to Buffal'o from The RAND 
Corporation in 1968 after 13 years of research on language 
and computing. Hays is honorary member of the  ~nternational 
Committee on Computational Linguistics, ed%tor (1974-78) of 
the Americaa Journal  of Computational L'inguistics, and former 
chairman of NSF's Social Science Advisory Committee. 
THE PRESS offers no free literature, but is preparing 
to i s s b e  a N e w s l e t t e r .  A $1 deposit will bring the f k s t  few 
issues, incfuding more about the hardware reviews. TIIE PRESS 
is located at Twin Willows, 5048 Lake Shore ~ o a d ,  Hanburg, 
New York 14075; the telephone number is 716-627-5571.

As for member services, we can continue microfiches; of fe r

issue newsletters along with qt iar ter ly  journal ; and give

TO PONDER CASE 
The Bell system operat ing companies have begun processing r eques t s  by 
LtCI C m u n i c a t  ions Corp., a Washington-based specialized carrier ,  for 
local telephone connections allowing blC1 t o  expand i t s  long-distance 
phone service, Execunet, t o  12 a d d i t i o n a l  cities. In Apr i l ,  t h e  U.S. 
Court of Appeals i n  Washington ordered ATFT and t h e  Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) t o  implement t he  court's July,  1977, ruling which 
authorized the  Exccunet service. In  May, the  cou r t  refused to reconsider 
I p s  earlier decision as reques ted  by ATET and t h e  FCC. A t  press erne, 
ATGT i s  seeking s stay while it asks t h e  Supqeme Court to c o n s i d e r  the 
CLISC. 
Despite the 1977 appeals court ruling (which the Supreme Court would not 
overrule last  ,January) , t h r  Fcdcrnl C~mn~~lnicat  ons Commiss'ion, i n  February 
rscc li ,z;:~~;~i~~!cn 3t , ;?~*t ,  4/78, p .  31, held that ATGT was not required t o  
make the addi t ional  l o c a l  corlncctions required to implement Execunet. 
A t  t ha t  time, only Commissioner Joseph Fogarty dissented from t he  FCC, 
f i l i n g ,  stating tha t  the  commission's action nul l i f ied t h e  1977 appeals 
cou r t  ruling. In its Apr i l  ruling t h e  cour t  agreed, arguing t h a t  "MCI 
is i n  e f fec t  no b e t t e r  o f f  than it w3s during the entire course of the 
litigatiod i n  t h i s  court. Notwithstandifig o u r  favor3ble decisicfn, it is 
unable to expand Execunet ." 
The appeals cour t  contended t h a t  AT&T%nd t b F C C  "twisted the issues we 
contemplated in this case beyond recognition, " ATET had argued that it 
would have to raise long-distance t e k p h o n e  rates if competition was 
in t roduced by MCI into densely populated areas with Execunet. The FCC 
he ld  t h a t  the  local  connections should be denied, contingent on i t s  
s tudy  into the  effects  o f  competi t ion on ATET. 
The Execunet service, which provides voice 'and data communications, 
involves c a l l i n g  a local number, then giving a code number t o  be connected 
through MCI Is network with another telephone in one of 18 c i t i e s  now served 
by Execunet. Tlre appeals cour t  dec i s ion  is a l s o  expected t o  a f f e c t

_-  -------- -  - - _ I --_ __ _ _ _  __ --- --- 
The Frdcral Rcscrve Roard has issued f i n a l  approval for a nationwjde 
i n t e rconnec t  ion of nl~tomnted (check) clearing houses (ACIls) which, by 
the end of t h i s  year, could pelnit the  Fed's c o r p o r a t e  custbmcrs t o  
deb i t  or credit t h e i r  private c u s t o n ~ e r s '  accounts us ing  the Federal 
Reserva Cormnunj cations System (FRCS) (see Wnshington Report, 3/78, 
p .  8). In t h e  p a s t ,  t h c  Fed ha s  provided ACH check processing, check 
set  t lcment , and check delivery services on a s t r i c t l y  regional basis .  
Thc April dccision follows a 1976 pi lo t  program undertaken by the Fed 
wllicll was cri t ic ized by a farmer M i t e  ljouse Office of Telecommunicat~ons 
Policy (O'TP) cjfficial as a " s u r r e p t i t i o u s  development of an 'on- l ine  
c;ipnbility." In the interregional  p i l o t  pmgram, some of the Fed's corporate 
customers f i led  d e b i t  o r  c r e d i t  i n s t r u c t i o n s  on magnetic tape with t h e i r  
local ACHs. These instructions were then t ra~~srni t tcd with FCRS t o  other 
rcgi onal A C l k  and cveh tua l l y  to the corporate customers banks. 
In January, sccking comment on the prop~scd nationwide program, the Fed's 
Board of Governors said that "the probable long-run efficiencies resulting 
from interconnection o f  a l l  operating ACH f a c i l i t i e s  just i fy  t h e  ~oard's 
action a t  t h i s  time t o  provide t h e s e  services . . . Moreover, t he  Board 
rcgands its action to interconnect the current regional ACH facilities 
as a rcscarch and development program t h a t  w i l l  p r o v i d e  technicxl da t a  
and cxpcricnce i n  the operation of t h e  nationwide ACH f a c i l i t i e s .  The 
Federal Reserve System i n t ends  ta make this informat ion  available t o  
t h o s e  i n  the pr iva te  sector i n t e r e s t e d  in the development of a l t e r n a t i ~ e  
systcms. " 
The Fed a l s o  c i t ed  recommcndati~ns of t h e  National Commission on Electronic  
Fund Trahsfers [NCEFT) (see WasMngtm Report, 11/77, p. 2 )  which urged 
the Fed t o  continue development of "ACH-like services ," 'while also 
encouraging pr iva t e  sector development in the same a h a .  However, the 
Privacy Protect ion Study Commission (see Wgsllingtcm Report, 8/77. p.  2)  
rccommendcd that "no Government entity be allomd t o  own, opcrrate, o r  
otherwise manage any p a r t  of  an qlectronic payments mechanism t h h t  
involves. transact ions among private pa r t i e s .  The Fed has recently 
implmented procedures which mandate removal o f  most a l l  individual 
names h e l d  i n  a data base after 30 days. 
According t o  the Fed, 95 out of 121 sets of comments received since last 
.January crldorsed the interregional ACH connccti-on . Among those c r i t i c a l  
o f  t h e  program, the Dcpartment of Justice noted  t h a t  Federal Reserve 
involvement would discourage t h e  priyate sector from devkloping similar 
systcms because the Fed does not charge f o r  i t s  program. 
In  i t s  January announcement, t h e  Fed added t h a t  p r o v i s i o n  of t he  " i n t e r -  
bank s e r v i c e f 1  slmuld a1 s o  "enhance the  o p p o r t u n i t i e s  open t o  depository 
ins t i tu t ions  f o r  developing improved ' r e t a i l '  payments services for the 
pikb,lic." Although not  provided for in this nationwide ACH interconnection, 
a point - o f - s a l e  (POS) switch could conceivably link consumers and r e t a i l e r s  
w i t h  ACHs and the Fed. I'he NCEFT urged the Federal government not to 
become involved "operationally" in POS switches "at  present or  jn the  
foreseeable fu ture ."
