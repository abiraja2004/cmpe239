A diversity and a flexibility of language 
expression forms are awkward problems for the 
machine processing of language, such as trans- 
lation, indexing and question-answering. This 
paper presents a method of decomposing Japanese 
sentences appearing in the Patent Documents on 
"Pulse network", into normal forms. First, the 
linguistic information is analysed and classi- 
fied based on the human linguistic process. 
Then, predicate functions, phrase functions and 
operators are introduced as the normal forms. 
Finally, the decomposing procedure and some 
experimental results are shown. 
Introduction 
One of the most remarkable features of 
natural language is a diversity and a flexibil- 
ity of its expression form. Especially, 
Japanese appears to have a peculiar syntactic 
structure because it is an agglutinative 
language. This is an awkward problem for the 
machine processing of language, such as trans- 
lation, subject indexing and question-answering. 
An approach to dealing with this problem is to 
transform the sentences into some normal forms 
if any. Proposals for such normalization have 
been made for some time, but there have been 
few attempts.l, 2 
The normal form needs to have every infor- 
mation which is contained in original sentences. 
Let us now consider what information the 
sentences contain. In human linguistic process, 
the objects to be exprssed are provided first, 
then the cognitive structure corresponding to 
them is formed, and lastly the language expres- 
sion based on the cognitive structure is 
produced. In other words, the immediate basis 
of language expression is considered to be 
human cognitive structure. Therefore, the 
arrangement of words in sentences represents 
not only the relation among objects in the 
external world, but also the cognitions and the 
relations among them, which are relatively 
independent of the present objects. 
This paper presents a method of decomposing 
Japanese sentences into normal forms based on 
such human linguistic process. First of all, 
the linguistic information necessary for decom- 
posing process is analysed and classified from 
the above mentioned point of view. Then, 
predicate functions, phrase functions and 
operators are introduced as the normal forms. 
Two kinds of function describe the syntactic 
structure of the sentences and phrases. The 
operator describes the relationship among func- 
tions. Finally, the decomposing procedure and 
some experimental results are shown. Sample 
sentences are selected from the claim points of 
the Japanese Patent Documents on "pulse network". 
Analysis of linguistic information 
In this section, we analyse and classify 
the linguistic information necessary for decom- 
posing Japanese sentences into their normal 
forms. 
Classification of words 
From the standpoint of the linguistic process, 
that is, objects, cognitions and expressions, 
all words are divided into objective expressions 
W 1 and subjective expressions W 2. W 1 is the set 
of expressions which reflect external objects, 
namely, conceptual expressions. On the other 
hand, W 2 is the set of cognitive expressions 
without conceptual process, and immediately 
represents the affection, judgement, desire, 
will and so on. The detail of the classifica- 
tion of words is summarized in Table i. We give 
supplementary explanations about Table i. 
Adjective ~ is the words which are called stem 
of adjectival verb in the traditional Japanese 
grammar. For inflectional words such as AAn, 
Vn, TB n and JJn, we specify n as i, 2, 3, 4, 
and 5(6) according to inflectional forms, that 
is, negative, declinable word modifying, final, 
noun modifying, and conditional(imperative) 
form respectively. 
Analysis of cognitive structure 
In order to describe the content of words and 
the relation among words, we introduce the 
descriptive scheme M which consists of such 
five descriptors as follows; 
M = < O, E, U, ~, A >. 
(i) 0 = {s~l(substance) , a~2(attribute), r~3 
(relation)}. 0 is the cognitive unit formed 
by separating and abstracting the external 
objects ideally, and is classified into three 
large categories, namely, substances, attributes 
and relations. The symbol ~i specifies the 
variety and the abstracting level of each unit. 
Thus, 0 is regarded as the classification of 
concepts in the objective world (e.g., pulse 
network). 
(2) ~ = {oi, o2, 03}. E describes the rela- 
tionship between objects from the various view 
points, o I is the relationship between sub- 
stance and attribute, o 2 is the relationship 
between substance and relation, and o 3 is the 
492- 
various connection of the same kind of objects. 
(3) U represents the active cognitions which 
are relatively independent of concepts. 
(4) ~ specifies the cognitive behaviors how the 
speaker cognize the objects. 
(5) A = {if(tense), 12(anaphora)}. A represents 
the relation between a speaker and objects. 
A part of O, Z, U and ~ is tabulated in 
Table 2-5 respectively. 
Definition of predicate function 
In this section and following two sections, 
we define the normal forms of Japanese sentences~ 
Generally, a sentence expresses the property of 
an object, or the relationship among objects. 
The component which indicates such property or 
relationship, is the predicate of a sentence. 
So we introduce the function, the constants of 
which are the predicate and the case postposi- 
tions, and the variables of which are noun 
phrases just in front of case postpositions. 
This function is called predicate function and 
is expressed by 
XlalX2a2...Xiai...XnanP 
where Xi, a i and P indicate the noun phrase, the 
case postposition and the predicate respectively.

However, a predicate P has a variety of ex- 
pression form in Japanese. For example, a 
verb is frequently connected with some aux- 
iliary verbs(e.g., NAl(negative), TA(past)) 
or verbal suffixes(e.g., RARERU(passive), 
SASERU(causative)). Therefore, we decom- 
pose the predicate P into objective 
expression Po and subjective expression Ps. 
Then, we define the basic predicate function 
as the function which donsists of the 
following four kinds Of predicate PoPs . 
(i) Po(Final form of verb) Ps(Zero element 
of speaker's judgement), 
(2) Po(Final form of adjective I) Ps(Zero 
element of speaker's judgement), 
(3) Po(Adjective ~)  Ps(Judgement 
expression "DA(be)"), 
(4) Po(Noun) Ps(Judgement expression 
"DA(be) "). 
The application of operators presented in 
next section, inflects the form of Po or Ps. 
Other predicate functions are defined by the 
application of operators to basic predicate 
functions. Thus, the predicate functions 
are classified as follows. 
f Constant function 
Predicate (ideomatic expression) 
function Basic predicate function 
Derivative function 
The predicate generally represents some 
attribute concept. Unlike substances an 
attribute does not occur alone. It arises 
accompanying substances. When we cognize an 
attribute as the concept, there exist some sub- 
stances which accompany this attribute. The 
variables corresponding to these substances are 
called obligatory variables of the predicate, 
and the case postpositions, obligatory ones aei. 
On the other hand, one substance usually accom- 
panies various kinds of attribute, and is 
related to other substances as a mediation of 
this attribute. In the predicate function, the 
variables corresponding to such attributes and 
substances are called facultative variables, and 
the  case postpositions, facultative ones aoi. 
The variables of a predicate function have 
some domains of their own, that is to say, sub- 
stitutable word classes. So we specify the 
domain of variables in terms of the descriptor O. 
Also, the relationship between the predicate and 
each variable is given by the descriptor E. 
These are summarized in Table 6. 
Definition of operators 
The operator produces a new function from 
one or two functions. They are classified into 
six groups, that is, modal(Fl) , nominalization 
(FII), embedding(fill), connecting(FIV), 
elliptical(F V) and anaphoric operator(Fvl). 
Modal operator 
The modal operators consist of the objective 
expressions Fil(e.g. , abstract verb, verbal 
suffix, a part of prefix) and the subjective 
expressions Fi2(e.g. , auxiliary verb, adverbial 
postposition). FII applies to Po of the predi-

Connecting operator 
A connecting operator joins one predicate func- 
tion to another coordinately or subordinately. 
Generally, it corresponds to conjunctions and 
conjunctive postpositions. Some operators are 
related to modal operators, attribute adverbs, 
or variety of predicate. It is classified into 
following six groups. 
(i) Conjunctive connecting operator(fIV I) 
S 1 : (SYOOHI DENRYOKU) GA TIISAI 
(The consumption power is small.) 
S 2 : (SWITCHING ZIKAN) GA MIZIKAI 
(The switching time is short.) 
SI*fIVI*S 2 
(SYOOHI DENRYOKU) GA TIISAKU, (SWITCHING ZIKAN)

and the switching time is short.) 
(2) Simultaneous conjunctive connecting 
operator(fIV2) 
S 1 : (TRANSISTOR) WO KUDOO-SURU 
(A thing drives the transistor.) 
S 2 : (HOOWADO) WO SEIGYO-SURU 
(A thing controls the saturation rate.) 
+ Sl*fIV2*S 2 
(TRANSISTOR) WO KUDOO-SURU TO DOOZI NI 
(HOOWADO) WO SEIGYO-SURU (The moment a thing 
drives the transistor, it controls the 
saturation rate.) 
(3) Disjunctive connecting operator(fIV 3) 
S 1 : (CONDENSER) WO SETUZOKU-SURU 
(A person connects a capacitor.) 
S 2 : (COIL) WO IRERU 
(A person inserts a coil.) 
+ Sl*flv3*s 2 
(CONDENSER) WO SETUZOKU-SURU K A (COIL) WO 
IRERU (A person connects a capacitor, or 
inserts a coil.) 
(4) Causal connecting operator(flV4) 
S I : (DENRYUU) GA (SYOTEITI) WO KOSU 
(The current exceeds the fixed value.) 
S 2 : (DENATU HENKA) GA SYOOZIRU 
(The voltage changes.) 
+ SI*fIV4*S2 
(DENRYUU) GA (SYOTEITI) WO KOSU TO (DENATU 
HENKA) GA SYOOZIRU (The voltage changes when 
the current exceeds the fixed value.) 
(5) Concessive connecting operator(flV5) 
S I : (SYUUKI) WO KAERU 
(A person changes the period.) 
S 2 : (SINPUKU) GA ITTEI-DA 
(The amplitude is constant.) 
+ SI*flv5*S 2 
(SYUUKI) WO KAE TEMO (SINPUKU) GA ITTEI-DA 
(Even if a person changes the periode, the 
amplitude is constant.) 
(6) Modificatory operator(flV6) 
S I : (TEIKO0) WO KAISURU 
(Through the resistor) 
S 2 : (BASE) WO (DENGEN) NI SETUZOKU-SURU 
(A person connects the base to the power 
source.) 
+ SI*fIv6*S 2 
(TEIKO0) WO KAISI TE (BASE) WO (DENGEN) NI 
SETUZOKU-SURU (A person connects the base to 
the power source through the resistor.) 
Generally, more than one connecting opera- 
tor is applied in the actual sentences. So we 
define the universal connecting formula as 
follows. Let fII and fIII be the nominalization 
and the embedding operator respectively. An 
arbitrary predicate function A i is expressed by 
A i = Ail*fivl*Ai2*flVl*... 
*fIVl*Aik*fIVl* .*fIViAi m 
where Ai k is 
(i) Su, 
(~) \[Ai*flVd*Aj\] (d = 2,3,4,5,6). 
Su is the basic predicate function, or the 
derivative function which is produced by the 
application of more than one modal operator, and 
is called unit predicate function. Moreover, 
the embedding operator is sometimes applied to 
Su in the following way. 
Su(flll-A~, A~,...., A~,..., A~) 
where A~ = fiiAi . 
Other operators 
When one predicate function is produced by the 
application of the connecting operator to two 
functions, the elliptical operator omits the one 
of the same expression forms in the two functions 
and anaphoric operator replaces the one of the 
same expression forms with the pronoun. 
Definition of phrase function 
We introduce the phrase function in order 
to describe the structure of noun phrases or 
compound words. However, it is not easy to 
define the phrase function based on the word 
class, unlike the predicate function. So we 
classify the phrases according to their content, 
and define the phrase function based on this 
classification. An example of phrase function 
is listed in Table 9. 
G 1 is the phrase connected in terms of such 
relational concepts as position(rl) , reference 
(r2) , and part(rs). G 2 is the phrase formed by 
cognitive behaviors(Y), such as enumeration(@10, 
@II), cognition of one object from the various 
view point(@9) , concrete and abstract cognition 
of one object(~7), and so on. G 3 is the phrase 
constructed in terms of the relationship(o I) 
between substance and attribute, and the various 
- -496-  
connection(o 3) of the same kind of objects. 
G 4 is other phrases. 
Decomposition process 
The new derivative functions can 
be produced by the application of the 
various operators to the basic predicate 
functions. This means that the sentences 
with complex syntactic structure correspond 
to one predicate function. Therefore, the 
normalization of sentences is the decom- 
position of the predicate function corre- 
sponding to these sentences, into a set of 
basic predicate functions, phrase func- 
tions and operators. In this section, we 
describe the decomposing procedure 4. 
Machine dictionary 
A machine dictionary consists of three 
elementary dictionaries, that is, word 
dictionary(WD), predicate function dic- 
tionary(PFD) and related concept diction- 
ary(RCD). WD is utilized to acquire the 
basic linguistic information of each words 
in input sentences. PFD is given to the 
candidate word for predicate, such as verb, 
adjective, and so on, and is used to extract 
the predicate function from sentences and 
phrases. RCD is stored with the relation 
between concepts, and is used for not only 
the decision of embedded phrase but also 
the analysis of phrases. Table i0 shows an 
example of each dictionary. 
Procedural description 
General flow of decomposition process. 
The general procedural flow and the data 
flow of decomposition process are shown in 
Fig.l and Fig.2 respectively. Input Japa- 
nese sentences spelled in Roman letters are 
segmented word by word with spaces. 
Each word is matched with entry words 
of WD. The word Iist(WLIST) is constructed 
based on the information from WD. The 
candidate for predicate (e.g., verb, adjec- 
tive) is found by searching WLIST from the 
head of the list. Then, the modal operator 
(Fill, FII 2 and FI21) , embedding operator 
fill and connecting operator FIV are extract- 
ed by investigating the variety and the 
inflectional form of the predicate or the 
words which follow the predicate. The 
extracting method of these operators is shown 
in Fig.3. The extracted information is 
stored in FLIST 1 and CLIST. The variables 
of the predicate function are extracted by 
reference to PFD. At the same time, the 
modal operators FI2 3 and FI2 4 are extracted, 
if any. If the obligatory variable of the 
function is omitted, the word whose concept 
is coincident with the domain of the 
variable, is found from the extracted word 
string in WLIST. This is regarded as the 
application of the elliptical operator. 
When the embedding operator applies to the 
predicate, the variety of the nominaliza- 
tion operator and the embedded phrase are

decided. The extracted information is 
stored FLIST I, and the word strings of the 
variables are stored in VLIST. These word 
strings are decomposed into basic predicate 
functions, nominalization operators and 
phrase functions, and then stored in FLIST 2 
and GLIST. The above procedure are repeat- 
ed for other predicate candidates. Finally, 
the connecting formula which indicates the 
relation among predicate functions are form- 
ed by reference to CLIST. 
Processing of phrases. At first, the 
procedure finds the candidate for predicate, 
such as dynamic attribute noun, declinable 
word modifying form of common verb, prefix 
(e.g., "KOO(high)", "TEl(low)", "DAl(large)", 
,etc.) and adjective II, from the word strings 
stored in VLIST. If the candidate is found, 
the basic predicate function, nominalization 
operator and embedded word are extracted. If 
not, the phrase function are extracted. They 
are classified into three types according to 
decision method. 
\[Type I\] Phrase functions extracted by the 
features of their constant. The example are 
gl01, g201, g301, and so on, in Table 9. 
Their constants, such as "RYeS(both)", "KAN 
(between)", "TAHOe(another)", "DAI", "KS", 
etc., are given the priority based on the 
strength of the connectability to variable, 
and are stored in constant list. The phrase 
function of this type is extracted according to 
priority. 
\[Type II\] Phrase functions extracted by using RCD. 
The examples are g105, g308, and so on. 
\[Type III\] Phrase functions extracted by using 
the variety or level of word concept. For 
example, g20'3 is extracted by investigating 
whether the upper concepts of both words agree 
with each other or not, and g204 is done by 
investigating whether the concept of second word

Experiments 
The merit of above procedure is the combination 
of top-down processing and bottom-up processing. 
The formar finds a key word in sentences without 
reference to the word order. The latter analyses 
word string based on the key word. This is ad- 
vantageous for the processing of Japanese sen- 
tences in which the word order variation and the 
embedding appear frequently. 
The procedure was programmed by the assembly 
language of TOSBAC-40C mini computer. The 
experimental results for sentences in 30 docu- 
ments confirmed the adequacy of our procedure. 
The examples of phrases and sentences processing 
are shown in Fig.4-5. 
Conclusion 
This paper have presented the method of 
decomposing Japanese sentences into normal forms. 
This method has following desirable advantages: 
(i) The descriptive scheme M which describes the 
word content and the relation among words, is 
introduced based on the human linguistic process. 
This will be useful for language processing in- 
cluding the pragmaties in the future. 
(2) The normal forms which consist of the basic 
predicate function, phrase function and operator, 
are interpreted according to the descriptive 
scheme M. This is useful for the semantic 
processing of input sentences. 
(3) The structure of considerably long sentences 
can be described by the embedding and connecting 
operators. 
(4) The structural description of phrases or 
compound words is useful to reduce the amount of 
storage for word dictionary. 
(5) The normal forms of sentences can serve as 
input data for an automatic subject indexing or 
abstracting of documents in the information 
retrieval system 5'6 
The problems left unsolved are word segmen- 
tation of input Japanese sentences, detection of 
syntactic and semantic ambiguity, and semantic
