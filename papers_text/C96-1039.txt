Abstract 
Various strategies are proposed to identify 
and classify three types of proper nouns in 
Chinese texts. Clues from character, 
sentence and paragraph levels are employed 
to resolve Chinese personal names. 
Character, Syllable and Frequency 
Conditions are presented to treat 
transliterated personal names, To deal with 
organization ames, keywords, prefix, word 
association and parts-of-speech are applied. 
For fair evaluation, large scale test data are 
selected from six sections of a newspaper. 
The precision and the recall for these three 
types are (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%, 
71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively. 
When the former two types are regarded as a 
category, the performance becomes (81.46%, 
91.22%). Compared with other approaches, 
our approach as better performance and our 
classification is automatic. 
1. Introduction 
A Chinese sentence is composed of a string of 
characters without any word boundaries, so that to 
segment Chinese sentences is indispensable in 
Chinese language processing (Chen, 1990; Chen, 
1994). Many word segmentation techniques (Chen 
& Liu, 1992; Chiang et al, 1992; Sproat & Shih, 
1990) have been developed. However, the 
resolution of unknown words, i.e., those words not 
in the dictionaries, form the bottleneck. Some 
papers (Fung & Wu, 1994; Wang et al, 1994) based 
on Smadja's paradigm (1993) learned an aided 
dictionary from a corpus to reduce the possibility of 
unknown words. Chang et al (1992) proposed a
method to extract Chinese personal names from an 
11,000-word corpus, and reported 91.87% precision 
and 80.67% recall. Wang et al (1992) recognized 
unregistered names on the basis of titles and a 
surname-driven rule. L inet  al. (1993) presented a 
model to tackle a very restrictive form of unknown 
words. Sproat et al (1994) considered Chinese 
personal names and transliterations of foreign words. 
Their performance was 61.83% precision and 
80.99% recall on an 12,000-Chinese-character 
corpus. 
This paper deals with three kinds of proper 
nouns - say, Chinese personal names, transliterated 
personal names and organization ames. We not 
only tell if an unknown word is a proper noun, but 
also assign it a suitable semantic feature. In other 
words, '~?~4~ ~' (George Bush) will have a feature 
of male transliterated personal name when it is 
identified. Such a rigid treatment will be helpful for 
further applications uch as anaphora resolution 
(Chen, 1992), sentence alignment (Chert & Chert, 
1994; Chen& Wu, 1995), etc. Section 2 describes 
the training corpora nd the testing corpus we used. 
Sections 3, 4 and 5 propose tile identification and 
classification methods of Chinese personal names, 
transliterated personal names and organization 
names, respectively. Section 6 presents two 
applications. Section 7 concludes the remarks. 
2. Training Corpora and Testing Corpus 
The proposed methods in this paper integrate the 
rule-based and the statistics-based models, so that 
training corpora are needed. To test the 
performance of language models, a good testing 
corpus is also necessary. This section introduces all 
the corpora that are used in the following sections. 
NTU balanced corpus, which follows the 
standard of LOB corpus (Johansson, 1986), is the 
first training corpus. It is segmented by a word 
segmentation system and is checked manually. In 
total, this corpus has 113,647 words and 191,173 
characters. 
The second training corpus is extracted from 
three newspaper corpora (China Times, Liberty 
Times News and United Daily News). It is just 
segmented by a word segmentation system without 
checking manually. Although segmentation errors 
may exist, this corpus is 23.2 times larger than NTU 
balanced corpus, so that we can get more reliable 
word association pairs. 
The third training corpus is a transliterated 
personal name corpus. There are 2,692 
transliterated personal names, including 1,414 
male's names and 1,278 female's names. Those 
transliterated personal names are selected from a 
book "English Names For Yon" (Huang, 1992). 
The last training data is a Chinese personal name 
corpus. It has 219,738 Chinese personal names and 
661,512 characters. 
222 
Finally, the testing corpus is introduced. We 
randomly select six different sections from a 
newspaper corpus (Liberty Times News). The 
contents are different from the second training 
corpus. The following shows the statistics of the 
testing corpus: 
(a) the political section 
There are many items of news about the 
legislature. It includes 23,695 words and 
36,059 characters. 
(b) the social section 
There are many items of news about police 
and offenders. It includes 61,846 words and 
90,011 characters. 
(c) the entertainment section 
There are many items of news about TV stars, 
programs, and so on. It includes 38,234 
words and 55,459 characters. 
(d) the international section 
It contains many items of foreign news and 
has 19,049 words and 29,331 characters. 
(e) the economic section 
Many items of news about stock market, 
money, and so on, are recorded. It includes 
39,008 words and 54,124 characters. 
(f) the sports section 
All items of news concern sports. It includes 
36,971 words and 54,124 characters. 
Every section has its own characteristics. In the 
political section, there are many titles. In the social 
section and the entertainment ~ection, there are 
many Chinese personal names and organization 
names. In the international section, transliterated 
personal names are more than the other two. In the 
economic section, stock companies often appear. In 
the sports section, there are many Chinese personal 
names and transliterated personal names. Because 
the proper nouns are usually segmented into single 
characters, they will interfere with one another 
during identification and classification. 
3. Chinese Personal Names 
3.1 Structure of Personal Names 
Chinese personal names are composed of surnames 
and names. Most Chinese surnames are single 
character and some rare ones are two characters. 
The following shows three different ypes: 
(a) Single character like '~ ' ,  }~', '~ '  and '-9:-'. 
(b) Two characters like '~ \ [~ '  and'  k'(('. 
(c) Two surnames together like ' J I ,~' .  
Most names are two characters and some rare ones 
are one character. Theoretically, every character 
can be considered as names rather than a fixed set. 
Thus the length of Chinese personal names ranges 
from 2 to 6 characters. 
3.2 Strategies 
3.2.1 Segmentation before Identif ication 
Input text has to be segmented roughly beforehand. 
This is because many characters have high 
probabilities to be a Chinese personal name without 
pre-segmentation. Consider the example '~!,)~l~,@~l+j 
(@~l~...'. The character '(i@' has a high score to be 
a surname. In this aspect, '~)~'  is easy to be a 
name. If the input text is not segmented beforehand, 
it is easy to regard '(q~.~J~' as a Chinese personal 
name. On the statistical model, this type of errors is 
difficult to avoid. However, it is easy to capture by 
pre-segmentation. 
3.2.2 Variation of a Character  
How to calculate the score of a candidate is an 
important issue in this identification system. The 
paper (Chang et al, 1992) proposes the following 
formula: 
(I) P(W,GN) = P(GN) * P(WIGN ) 
This formula has a drawback, i.e., it does not 
consider the probability of a character to be the 
other words rather than a surname. Take the two 
characters '{,~,~' and 'llil\[' as an example. The 
character '{'~j.' can form '{~' ,  '1",1/~ ', 'l"~/-iiTfi ', and 
many other words. On the contrary, the character' 
I@i' just forms a word '@\[1~', which is a rare word. 
The difference shows that the former is easier to be 
used as the other words than the latter. The above 
formula assigns the same score to '@/:-~' and '@\[(-~', 
when '{'0?' and '111~' have the same frequency to be 
names. Intuitively, '{~lj.~'-'.' does not look like a name, 
but 'ItlJU~.' does. Thus 'tliI(' should have higher score 
than '{~l', and the variation of a character should be 
considered in the formula. In our model, the 
variation of characters is learned from NTU 
balanced corpus. 
3.2.3 Baseline Model 
Equation (2) defines the original formula. The 
formula used to calculate P(Ci) is similar to 
Equation (1). When the variation of a character is 
considered, Equation (3) is formulated. The 
variation of a character is measured by the inverse 
of the frequency of the character to be the other 
words. Equation (4) is simplified from Equation (3). 
(2) 1'(C1) x P(C2) x P(C3) 
1 l 1 
(3) P(CI)  x - -  x t'(C2) x - -  x P(C3) x -~ - -  
& Cl & C2 & C3 
# CI # C2 # C3 
(4) - -  x - -  ? - -  
&C I  &(72 &C3 
where Ci is a character in the input sentence, 
P(Ci) is the probability of Ci to be a 
surname or a name, 
#Ci is the frequency of Ci to be a surname 
or a name, 
223  
&Ci is the frequency of Ci to contain in 
tile other words. 
For different ypes of surnames, different models are 
adopted. 
(a) Single character 
# CI # C2 # C3 
(5) - -  x - -  x - -  > Threxholdl 
& CI & ('2 & C3 
#C1 
(6) - - ->  ThreshoM2 
& (71 
# (_72 # C3 
and - -  x - -  > Threshold3 
& (72 & (73 
(b) Two characters 
# C2 # (;3 
(7) - -  ? - -  > Threshold4 
& (72 & C3 
(c) Two surnames together 
#Cl l  #C12 #C2 #C3 
(8)  - - - -  ? - - ? - -  ? - -  
&CI I  &C I2  &C2 &C3 
> "lhreshold5 
#Cl l  #C12 
(9) - -  ? - -  > 7hreshoM6 
& C11 & C12 
# C2 # C3 
and - - -x  - - -  > 7hreshoM7 
&C2 &C3 
Because the surnames w~th two characters are 
always surnames, Model (b) neglects the score of 
surname part. Models (a) and (c) have two score 
functions. It avoids the problem of very high score 
of surnames. Consider the string '1~ ; ' i t (  ")j~J ' 
\[".4:J ( J~  @<-". Because of the high scores of the 
characters '1~' and 'S,', '\[~N~} f ' , '  f:, -NI', ' t:,~:J - 2" 
and 'J{~ -~ '  may be identified according to 
Equation (5). Equation (6) screens out the 
impossible candidates. The above three models can 
be extended to single-character names. When a 
candidate cannot pass the threshold, its last 
character is cut off and the remaining part is tried 
again. The threshold is different from the original 
one. Thresholds are trained from Chinese personal 
name corpus. We calculate the score of every 
Chinese personal name in the corpus using the 
above formulas. The scores for each formula are 
sorted and the one which is less than 99% of the 
personal names is considered as a threshold for this 
fornmla. That is, 99% of the training data can pass 
the threshold. 
3 .2 .4  Other  C lues  
Text provides many useful clues from three different 
levels - say, character, sentence and paragraph 
levels. The baseline model forms the first level, i.e., 
character level. The following subsections present 
other clues. Of these, gender is also a clue from 
character level; title, mutual information and 
punctuation marks come from sentence level; tile 
paragraph information is recorded in cache. 
3.2.4.1 Clue 1: Title The first is title. Wang et a/. 
(1992) propose a model based on titles When a 
title appears before (after) a candidate, it is probably 
a personal name. For example, '~ . -~)N I~,  ' and ' 
~,~ ~)'~ :~, ~. ~\]( '  However, there are many 
~!~,~ \[ J Thus counterexamples, e.g., ' ~'  ' ; (~ ~"-4 :~'~ ~ ' f'J " s' :  Y ' . , . ,  
we cannot make sure if the characters urrounding a 
title form a personal name. Even so, title is still a 
useful clue. it can help determine the boundary of a 
name. In the example '~.J~J!~'~;~;:i-qj...',' ~-IDJ!SJ'~I~, '' is 
identified incorrectly. When a title is included in 
this example, i.e., '~JDJ!~!I~',;I~'~;IJ... ', the error does 
not occur. In sumnmry, if a title appears, a special 
bonus is given to the candidate 
3.2.4.2 Clue 2: Mutual hfformation Chinese 
personal names are not always composed of single 
characters. For example, the name part of the 
sentence 'l~i~rl)Jv~Jlai~lc'/;~'r~';jtlfj' is a word. How to 
tell out that a word is a content word or a name is 
indispensable. Mutual information (Church & 
Hanks, 1990) provides a measure of word 
association. The words surrounding a word 
candidate are checked. When there exists a strong 
relationship, the word candidate has high 
probability to be a content word. In the example '1~ 
~! J :~ l ' /  ' ,~<~Jl~?_~., . ' ,  the two words "C I!!:" 
and '~.~ \[tl' have high mutual reformation, so that 'lI~, i 
1~' is not a personal name. Three newspaper 
corpora (total size is about 2.6 million words) are 
used to train the word association. 
3.2.4.3 Clue 3: Punctuation Marks Personal 
names usually appear at the head or the tail of a 
sentence. A candidate is given an extra bonus when 
it is found from these two places. Candidates 
surrounding the caesura mark, a Chinese-specific 
punctuation mark, are treated in the similar way. If 
some words around this punctuation are personal 
names, the others are given bonus. 
3.2.4.4 Clue 4: Gender There is a special custom 
in Chinese. A married woman may mark her 
husband's urname before her surname. That forms 
type 3 personal name mentioned in Section 3.1, 
Because a surname may be considered as a name, 
e.g., '7/'  in the personal name ~'~'/~Jt~ and in 
,~,~r/,-, v . the candidates with two tile personal name c~ ,,~,, 
possible surnames do not always belong to type 3 
personal name. The gender information, i.e., type 3 
is always a female, helps us disambiguate he type of 
personal names. Some Chinese characters have 
high score for male and some for female. The 
following lists some typical examples: 
male: ~ ,  ,~, ~,", ~t~,-1t(, ~j~, J?J(~, 9~i, JI(, (~l,)~; 
female: ~i~, J~, I~, ~l l, ~:~, ~;, {}::, '{~L ~Y, )J:, -+-/ 
224  
We count the frequencies of the characters to be 
male and female, and compare these two scores. If 
the former is larger than the latter, then it is a 
masculine name. Otherwise, it is a fenfinine name. 
3.2.4.5 Clue 5: Cache A personal name may 
appear lnore than once in a paragraph This 
phenomenon is useful durmg identification We use 
cache to store the identified candidates, and reset 
cache when next paragraph is considered There are 
four cases shown below when cache is used: 
(a) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, and 
C I C2 is correct. 
(b) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, and 
both are correct. 
(c) CIC2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, and 
C 1 C2C3 is correct. 
(d) C1C2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, and 
CIC2 is correct. 
Here Ci denotes a Chinese character. It is obvious 
that case (a) contradicts with case (b). Consider the 
string '5J~J!i}'i;~,'J,)-}:jl','lif~:'j: ~l;~'. A personal ,mum '~! 
ID\]J?;;\[~, '' is recognized. When another string '}<-I~lJl})~. 
~lt/Jxq':?lJI,.';'_~')'l'lili~,t~' is input, '~,~llllfA)~' and 'Tlldx>l ":' 
are identified Then we find the two strings '/}'i.J~\]}~)~, 
' and ' +'iJ~\]J'.~;a:'lY/' re similar. Here case (a) is correct. 
However, case (b) also appears very often in 
newspapers. For example, 'l~lL,kT~ " J~l~J'gfJ~iH~ hi I,
~3...L Two personal names, 'li\[\]/k:~'~/ and 'lT\[~\]Kgt?' 
are identified In the examples like '~.~t~\[<gif~ " 
~. . . '  and '... ~ .~ o ', two candidates '~.~;{~t~, ' and '  
}'#~' will be identified. That belon~ to case (d). 
Consider the last examples '11',(,1 i*l 1~,1:<..' and '~,(, 
i~l l~g, rii:j.dz... ' Two candidates '~,({~ i' and '~',(,~" i~l I' 
will be identified too. Now, case (c) is adopted. 
in our treatment, a weight is assigned to each 
entry in the cache. The entry which has clear right 
boundary has a high weight. Title and punctuation 
are chics for boundary. For those similar pairs 
which have different weights, the entry having high 
weight is selected. If both have high weights, both 
are chosen. When both have low weights, the score 
of the second character of a name part is critical. It 
aetermiues if the character is kept or deleted. 
3.3 Exper iments  and  D iscuss ions  
Table l stunmarlzes the identification results of 
Chinese personal names. Total Chinese personal 
names in each section are listed in Cohlnm 2. 
Cohmm 3 shows the precision and the recall of the 
baseline model. The overall performance is good 
except for section 4 (the international section) and 
section 5 (the economic section). The remaining 
colunms demonstrate the change of performance 
after the clues discussed m Section 3.2 are 
considered incrementally. If name part of a 
candidate is a word, word association is used to 
measure the relationship between the surrotmding 
words. The increase of the precision in Cohmm 4 
verifies this idea. Theoretically, it shottld not 
decrease the recall. After checking the result, we 
find that some unreasonable word association comes 
from the training corpus. Recall that it is generated 
by a rough word segmentation system wlthoul 
manually-checking. The next clue is punctuation. 
The idea is that the candidates m the beginning or 
at the end of sentences have larger probabilities to 
be personal names than they are in other places. It 
helps some candidates with lower score to pass the 
threshold, but it cannot avoid the incorrect 
candidates to pass the threshold Thus, the 
performance is dangling. Then, title is considered 
The increase of the recall shows that title works well 
But it decreases the precision too. From the 
variation of the performance, we know that cache is 
powerful. Both the recall and the precismn increase. 
Finally, gender is joined It is used when two 
success ive  characters are candidates of surnames. 
In other words, it focuses on type 3 personal names. 
Almost all type 3 personal names are identified 
correctly. Because this type of personal names is 
rare in the testing newspaper corpus, the variation is 
not large. Table 1 shows that our model is good 
except for section 4 and section 5. There are many 
proper nouns in the international section, and 
ahnost all of them are not included m the dictionary. 
All unknown words disturb one another in 
segmentation. For example, ' q!ilI?~J~0,' is a countiy 
name. It is divided into three single characters by 
our word segmentation system. From the viewpoint 
of personal nmne identification, it is easy to regard '
lI,"r~J~ff as a Chinese personal name. Another source 
of errors is foreign names. Some of them are 
similar to Chinese personal names, e.g., '~'~!Ui}/i:' 
and ' <t&jE'.

The similar problem occurs in the economic section. 
There are many company names, and some of them 
are similar to Chinese personal names. The 
company name '~\]~\]i)t' is a typical example. In 
summary, there are three major errors. One is 
foreign name. They are identified as proper nouns 
correctly, but are assigned wrong features. About 
20% of errors belong to this type. The second type 
of errors results from the rare surnames, which are 
not included in the surname table. Some rare 
surnames are not real surnames. They are just 
artists' stage names. Near 14% of errors come from 
this type. The other errors include place names, 
organization ames, and so on. 
4. Transliterated Personal Names 
4.1 Structure of Personal Names 
Compared with the ideniification of Chinese 
personal names, the identification of transliterated 
personal names has the following difficulties: 
(a) No specific clue like surnames in Chinese 
personal names to trigger the identification system. 
(b) No restriction on the length Of a 
transliterated personal name. It may be composed 
of a single character or more, e.g., '5%', '~'i'\]d', "~ ' i  
~Y', '~ . f  ~':'}~-' and 'd\[if,~ \ ]~1\ ] '  
(c) No large scale transliterated personal name 
corpus. 
(d) Ambiguity in classification. 
For example, ' J~)~'  may denote a city or a 
former American president. 
4.2 S t ra teg ies  
4.2.1 Basic Idea 
Almost all foreign names are in transliteration, ot 
in translation. And the base of transliteration is
pronunciation of foreign names. Pronunciation is 
composed of syllables and tones. The major 
difference of pronunciation between Chinese and 
English is syllables. The style of syllabic order is 
specific in transliteration. Consider an example. 
The transliterated personal name ,~\ ]z~}.  has 
syllables 'Y  ~',7-- ~zv  T - -  ( (~ ' .  Such a 
syllabic order is rare in Chinese, but is not special 
for a transliterated string. In other words, the 
syllabic orders of transliterated strings and general 
Chinese strings are not similar. Besides, a 
transliterated name consists of a string of single 
characters after segmentation. That is, these 
characters cannot be put together. However, the 
unrestrictive length of transliterated names and 
homophones in Chinese result in the need of very 
large training corpus. The following sections how 
how to modify the basic idea if a large scale corpus 
is not available. 
4.2.2 Character  Condition 
When a foreign name is transliterated, the selection 
of homophones i restrictive. Consider an example 
shown below: 
Richard Macs ~ l l \ [~ l )~ ~ , ~ ,  ,~ 
Those strings following English names have the 
same pronunciations. The first is usually adopted, 
and the second is never used. It shows that the 
characters used in transliteration are selected from 
some character set. In our model, total 483 
characters are trained from our transliterated 
personal name corpus. They play the similar role of 
the surnames in the identification of Chinese 
personal names. If all the characters in a string 
belong to this set, i.e., they satisfy character 
condition, they are regarded as a candidate. 
4.2.3 Sy l lab le  Condition 
Because of the unrestrictive l ngth of transliterated 
names, how to identify their boundary is a problem. 
Of course, titles and punctuation used in last section 
can be adopted too. But they do not always appear 
in the text. Thus another clue should be found. 
Syllable order may be a clue. Those examples like ' 
~r~' ,  '~' J , , '  and ' ~ '  which meet the character 
condition do not look like transliterated names 
because their pronunciations are not like foreign 
names. If there is a large enough transliterated 
name corpus, the syllable orders can be learned. 
However, our transliterated corpus only contain 
2692 personal names. Thus only the first and the 
last characters are considered. For each candidate, 
we check the syllable of the first (the last) character. 
If the syllable does not belong to the training corpus, 
the character is deleted. The remaining characters 
are treated in the similar way. 
4.2,4 F requency  Condition 
As mentioned in Section 3.2.3, the frequency of a 
character to be a part of a personal name is 
important information. The concept may be used 
here. However, only large scale transliterated 
personal name corpus can give reliable statistical 
data. Based on our small training corpus, the range 
of the application of the information should be 
narrowed own. We only apply it in a candidate of 
length 2. This is because it is easy to satisfy the 
character condition for candidates of the shortest 
length. For each candidate which has only two 
characters, we compute the frequency of these two 
characters to see if it is larger than a threshold. If it 
is not, it is eliminated. The threshold is determined 
in the similar way as Section 3.2.3. 
4.3 Experiments and Discussions 
The identification system scans a segnlented 
sentence from left to right. It finds the character 
string that meets the character condition, syllable 
condition and frequency condition. Table 2 shows

the precision and the recall are both good for 
sections 3 and 4, i.e., the entertainment and the 
international sections. However, sections 2 and 5 
(lhe social and the economic sections) have bad 
precision. The average recall tells us that the 
tri,g~ger to the identification system is nsefnl. The 
reasons why the recall is not good enough are: some 
transliterated personal names (e.g., '?,~Oi~'j ~'and '~  
D{$~') look like Chinese personal names, and the 
identification of Chinese personal names is done 
before that of transliterated personal names. 
Although they are correctly identified as personal 
names, they are assigned wrong features. Similarly, 
transliterated nouns like popular brands of 
automobiles ('7\[~\[!~,'i:' and "l\[~,)l~|~j'), Chinese proper 
nouns (' ~I\] ~ '  ' ~.J:x)~' and '?t'~ II~') and Chinese 
personal names ( '~  I:~l\]') look like transliterated 
personal nmnes. That decreases the precision. 
f~esides these types of nouns, boundary errors affect 
the precision 1oo. For telling out the error rates 
from classification, we made another experiment. If 
the identified results are not classified, the average 
precision is 81.46% and the average recall is 
91.22%. 
5. Organization Names 
5.1 Structures of Organization Names 
Structures of organization ames are more complex 
than those of personal names. Some organization 
names are composed of proper nouns and content 
r~-ILIII~H,J is made up of words. For exmnple, '~" '" " ~:' 
the place name 'T' ?;\[\[; fii' and the content word '~t~',J-'. 
A personal nmne can also be combined a content 
word to form an organization ame, e.g., '~t,7~l I~1 
~i~\[ ii~ PJi '. Some organization names look like 
personal names, e.g., '\[j\[~)t'. Some organization 
names are composed of several related words. For 
example, '7~ II~ ~ ~ ~ "b~i, 3,~ ~ ~'  contains four 
words %'~11~', '~'c': ' ,  '~ '  and '3 ,~ ' .  Several 
single-character words can also form an 
organization name, e.g., ' JWt J~ ii~ ~ '. Some 
organization names have nested structures. 
Consider the string: '~l"~,~7;~lIfi~ ~?~,~ ? , i~  
/J~?\[t'. The group '~i J~/ J \~\[ l '  is a part of the 
committee ,x~.~.~q- , ,  and the committee itself is 
a part of '~I;~3~i~II~,;5'. Such complex structures 
make identification of organization names very 
difficult. 
Basically, a complete organization ame can be 
divided into two parts: name and keyword. In the 
'-~" l ' i  ' ':' i l-I\[~rtl is a name, and '1l~ example i i-Il  I ~f:~f'l, "~" ' "  
/I~J:' is a keyword. Many words can serve as names, 
but only some fixed words can be regarded as 
keywords. Thus, keyword ix an important clue to 
identify the organizations. However, there are still 
several difficult problems. First, keyword is usually 
a common content word. It is not easy to tell out a 
keyword and a content word. Second, a keyword 
may appear m the abbreviated form. For exmnple, ' 
.\]~i~i' x an incomplete keyword of '?~:~i?ill~l~, r\]'. 
Third, the keyword may be omitted completely. For 
example, '~_~),~' (Acer). The following shows two 
rough classifications, and discusses their feattues. 
( l)  Complete organization ames 
(a) Structure: This type of organization 
names is usually composed of proper nouns and 
keywords. 
(b) Length: Some organization names are 
very long, so it is hard to decide their length. 
Fortunately, only some keyword like 'l iil ~ J.~", ' ~ ~' ,  
'3,~,~,:~', '~\[\[,~I~', mid so on, have this problem. 
(c) Ambiguity: Some organization names 
with keywords are still mnbiguous. For exmnple, ' 
X l" ~(~ ii,~:,' and '1\[~, '~ ' .  They usually denote 
reading matters, but not organizations. However, if 
they are used in some contexts, e.g., "~ l"~f::il;~,~ ~ 
~f! J3t\[" and " l\[~, ~ ~\[~ (l~( ~lf )~ ", they should be 
interpreted as organizations. 
(2) Incomplete organization ames 
(a) Structure: These organization names 
often omit their keywords. 
(b) Ambiguity: The abbreviated organization 
names may be ambiguous. For example, '~t!,~($', '~  
~ ' , '  ,~,.,~!~' and ' /~ ' / "  . . .  L  - are famous sport teams m 
Taiwm~ or in U.S.A., however, they are also general 
content words. 
5.2 Strategies 
This section introduces ome strategies used in the 
identification. Keyword is a good indicator for an 
identification system. It plays the similar role of 
surnames. Keyword shows not only the possibility

of an occurrence of an organization ame, but also 
its right boundary. For each sentence, we scan it 
from left to right to find keywords. Because 
keyword is a general content word, we need other 
strategies to tell out its exact meaning. These 
strategies also have the capabilities to detect the left 
boundary if there is an organization ame. 
Prefix is a good marker for possible left 
boundary. For example, '\[,,~I~Z' (National), '~(~qL' 
(Provincial), '~\]~ qi? (Private), and so on. The name 
part of an organization may be forlned by single 
characters or words. These two cases are discussed 
as follows. 
(a) single characters 
After segmentation, there nmy be a sequence 
of single characters preceding a possible keyword 
The character may exist independently. That is, it is 
a single-character word. In this case, the content 
word is not a keyword, so that no organization ame 
is found If these characters cannot exist 
independently, they form the name part of an 
organization. The left boundary of the organization 
is determined by the following rule: 
We insert a single character to the name part 
until a word is met. 
(b) word(s) 
Here, a word is composed of at least two 
characters. If the word preceding the possible 
keyword is a place name or a personal name, then 
the word forms the name part of an organization. 
Otherwise, we use word association model to 
determine the left boundary. The postulation is: the 
words to compose a name part usually have strong 
relationships. The mutual information mentioned in 
Section 3.2.4.2 is also used to measure the 
relationship of two words. 
Part of speech is useful to determine the left 
boundary of an organization. The categories of 
verbs are very typical. The name part of an 
organization cannot extend beyond a transitive verb. 
If a transitive verb precedes a possible keyword, 
then no organization ame is found. Numeral and 
classifier are also helpful. For exan~ple, '~  HJ' 
(company) in '~f J . . . '  (three companies ...) is 
not a keyword due to the critical parts of speech. 
Because a tagger is not involved before 
identification, the part of speech of a word is 
determined wholly by lexical probability. 
5.3 Experiments and Discussions 
Table 3 shows the precision and the recall for every 
section. Section 4 (The International Section) has 
better precision and recall than other files. Most 
errors result from organization names without 
keywords, e.g., ',~,=~fijL~' '~+I(6', /\:L~I~:~!~I, JL~J, 
and so on. Even keywords appear, e.g., ' \ [ -r i J~r fJ' 
and '~r  ~ fi: ~-~', there may not always exist 
organization names. Besides error candidates and 
organization names without keywords, error left 
boundary is also a problem. Consider the exalnples: 
'~\[';~\['-'~!~.:),t~' and f~-~' .  In the first, '~qS)' 
should not be included: and in the second, a word ' 
3,~'~' is lost. 
6. Applications 
The senmntic lassification of proper nouns is use fill 
in many applications. Here, anaphora resolution 
and sentence aligmnent are presented. In general, 
pronoun often refers to the nearest proper noun 
(Chen, 1992). But it is not always true. The 
following shows a counter example: 
The first pronoun '1"1f~' (tie) refers to the personal 
name '-(~,~'. It is a normal example. The second 
pronoun '~ '  (he) refers to the same person, but the 
'~ '~ '  ' ; i ;~.~!'.  nearest personal name is ? ~j -~ rather than 
If  we know the gender of every personal name, then 
it is easy to tell out which person is referred, in the 
above example, the gender of the Chinese pronouns 
'~\[~' (he) and '/t\[\[~' (she) is masculine and feminine, 
respectively; tim persons ':~'17:~ ' and '.1:~'~-~'~'!'~' : ;'a, ~42~1'J\],-5?S are  
nmle and female, respectively. Therefore, the 
correct referential relationships can be well- 
established. In the experiment of the gender 
assignment, 3/4 of Chinese personal name corpus is 
regarded as training data, and the renmining l/4 is 
for testing. The correct rate is 89%. Sentence 
alignment (Chen & Chen, 1994) is important in 
228 
setup of a bilingual corpus. Personal name is one of 
important clues. Its use in aligning English- 
Chinese text is shown in the paper (Chen & Wu, 
1995\]. 
7, Conc lud ing  Remarks  
This paper proposes various strategies to identify 
and classify Chinese proper nouns. The 
perfornmnce evahmtion criterion is very strict Not 
only are the proper nouns identified, but also 
suitable features are assigned. The perforlnance 
(precision, recall) for the identification of Chinese 
personal names, transliterated personal nmnes and 
organization mnes is (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%, 
71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively. 
When the criterion is loosed a little, i.e., Chinese 
personal nmnes and transliterated personal names 
are regarded as a category, the performance ~s 
(81.46%, 91.22%). Compared with the approaches 
(Sproat et al, 1994: Fung & Wu, 1994: Wang et al, 
1994), we deal with more types of proper nouns and 
we have better performance. 
Some difficult problems hould be tackled in the 
flmlre. Foreign proper nouns may be transformed in
part by transliteration a d translation. The example 
"George Town" is transformed into ':~'{{~J4~'. The 
character 'b~' (town) results in translation and' fq:?(( 
(George) comes from transliteration. Tlus problem 
is interesting and worthy of resolving. The 
performance of identification of organization ames 
ms not good enough, especially for those organization 
names without keywords. It should be investigated 
further.
