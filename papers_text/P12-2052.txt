Abstract
Authorship attribution deals with identifying
the authors of anonymous texts. Building on
our earlier finding that the Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA) topic model can be used to
improve authorship attribution accuracy, we
show that employing a previously-suggested
Author-Topic (AT) model outperforms LDA
when applied to scenarios with many authors.
In addition, we define a model that combines
LDA and AT by representing authors and doc-
uments over two disjoint topic sets, and show
that our model outperforms LDA, AT and sup-
port vector machines on datasets with many
authors.
1 Introduction
Authorship attribution (AA) has attracted much at-
tention due to its many applications in, e.g., com-
puter forensics, criminal law, military intelligence,
and humanities research (Stamatatos, 2009). The
traditional problem, which is the focus of our work,
is to attribute test texts of unknown authorship to
one of a set of known authors, whose training texts
are supplied in advance (i.e., a supervised classifi-
cation problem). While most of the early work on
AA focused on formal texts with only a few pos-
sible authors, researchers have recently turned their
attention to informal texts and tens to thousands of
authors (Koppel et al, 2011). In parallel, topic mod-
els have gained popularity as a means of analysing
such large text corpora (Blei, 2012). In (Seroussi et
al., 2011), we showed that methods based on Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ? a popular topic model
by Blei et al (2003) ? yield good AA performance.
However, LDA does not model authors explicitly,
and we are not aware of any previous studies that
apply author-aware topic models to traditional AA.
This paper aims to address this gap.
In addition to being the first (to the best of
our knowledge) to apply Rosen-Zvi et al?s (2004)
Author-Topic Model (AT) to traditional AA, the
main contribution of this paper is our Disjoint
Author-Document Topic Model (DADT), which ad-
dresses AT?s limitations in the context of AA. We
show that DADT outperforms AT, LDA, and linear
support vector machines on AA with many authors.
2 Disjoint Author-Document Topic Model
Background. Our definition of DADT is motivated
by the observation that when authors write texts on
the same issue, specific words must be used (e.g.,
texts about LDA are likely to contain the words
?topic? and ?prior?), while other words vary in fre-
quency according to author style. Also, texts by the
same author share similar style markers, indepen-
dently of content (Koppel et al, 2009). DADT aims
to separate document words from author words by
generating them from two disjoint topic sets of T (D)
document topics and T (A) author topics.
Lacoste-Julien et al (2008) and Ramage et al
(2009) (among others) also used disjoint topic sets
to represent document labels, and Chemudugunta
et al (2006) separated corpus-level topics from
document-specific words. However, we are unaware
of any applications of these ideas to AA. The clos-
est work we know of is by Mimno and McCallum
(2008), whose DMR model outperformed AT in AA

Figure 1: The Disjoint Author-Document Topic Model
of multi-authored texts (DMR does not use disjoint
topic sets). We use AT rather than DMR, since we
found that AT outperforms DMR in AA of single-
authored texts, which are the focus of this paper.
The Model. Figure 1 shows DADT?s graphical rep-
resentation, with document-related parameters on
the left (the LDA component), and author-related
parameters on the right (the AT component). We de-
fine the model for single-authored texts, but it can be
easily extended to multi-authored texts.
The generative process for DADT is described be-
low. We use D and C to denote the Dirichlet and
categorical distributions respectively, and A, D and
V to denote the number of authors, documents, and
unique vocabulary words respectively. In addition,
we mark each step as coming from either LDA or
AT, or as new in DADT.
Global level:
L. For each document topic t, draw a word dis-
tribution ?(D)t ? D
(
?(D)
)
, where ?(D) is a
length-V vector.
A. For each author topic t, draw a word distribu-
tion ?(A)t ? D
(
?(A)
)
, where ?(A) is a length-
V vector.
A. For each author a, draw the author topic dis-
tribution ?(A)a ? D
(
?(A)
)
, where ?(A) is a
length-T (A) vector.
D. Draw a distribution over authors ? ? D (?),
where ? is a length-A vector.
Document level: For each document d:
L. Draw d?s topic distribution ?(D)d ? D
(
?(D)
)
,
where ?(D) is a length-T (D) vector.
D. Draw d?s author ad ? C (?).
D. Draw d?s topic ratio pid ? Beta
(
?(A), ?(D)
)
,
where ?(A) and ?(D) are scalars.
Word level: For each word index i in document d:
D. Draw di?s topic indicator ydi ? Bernoulli(pid).

and word wdi ? C
(

.
DADT versus AT. DADT might seem similar to
AT with ?fictitious? authors, as described by Rosen-
Zvi et al (2010) (i.e., AT trained with an additional
unique ?fictitious? author for each document, allow-
ing it to adapt to individual documents and not only
to authors). However, there are several key differ-
ences between DADT and AT.
First, in DADT author topics are disjoint from
document topics, with different priors for each topic
set. Thus, the number of author topics can be differ-
ent from the number of document topics, enabling
us to vary the number of author topics according to
the number of authors in the corpus.
Second, DADT places different priors on the
word distributions for author topics and document
topics (?(A) and ?(D) respectively). Stopwords are
known to be strong indicators of authorship (Kop-
pel et al, 2009), and DADT allows us to use this
knowledge by assigning higher weights to the ele-
ments of ?(A) that correspond to stopwords than to
such elements in ?(D).
Third, DADT learns the ratio between document
words and author words on a per-document basis,
and makes it possible to specify a prior belief of
what this ratio should be. We found that specify-
ing a prior belief that about 80% of each document
is composed of author words yielded better results
than using AT?s approach, which evenly splits each
document into author and document words.
Fourth, DADT defines the process that generates
authors. This allows us to consider the number
of texts by each author when performing AA. This
also enables the potential use of DADT in a semi-
supervised setting by training on unlabelled texts,
which we plan to explore in the future.
3 Authorship Attribution Methods
We experimented with the following AA methods,
using token frequency features, which are good pre-
dictors of authorship (Koppel et al, 2009).
265
Baseline: Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
Koppel et al (2009) showed that SVMs yield
good AA performance. We use linear SVMs in a
one-versus-all setup, as implemented in LIBLIN-
EAR (Fan et al, 2008), reporting results obtained
with the best cost parameter values.
Baseline: LDA + Hellinger (LDA-H). This ap-
proach uses the Hellinger distances of topic dis-
tributions to assign test texts to the closest author.
In (Seroussi et al, 2011), we experimented with two
variants: (1) each author?s texts are concatenated be-
fore building the LDA model; and (2) no concate-
nation is performed. We found that the latter ap-
proach performs poorly in cases with many candi-
date authors. Hence, we use only the former ap-
proach in this paper. Note that when dealing with
single-authored texts, concatenating each author?s
texts yields an LDA model that is equivalent to AT.
AT. Given an inferred AT model (Rosen-Zvi et al,
2004), we calculate the probability of the test text
words for each author a, assuming it was written
by a, and return the most probable author. We do not
know of any other studies that used AT in this man-
ner for single-authored AA. We expect this method
to outperform LDA-H as it employs AT directly,
rather than relying on an external distance measure.
AT-FA. Same as AT, but built with an additional
unique ?fictitious? author for each document.
DADT. Given our DADT model, we assume that the
test text was written by a ?new? author, and infer
this author?s topic distribution, the author/document
topic ratio, and the document topic distribution. We
then calculate the probability of each author given
the model?s parameters, the test text words, and the
inferred author/document topic ratio and document
topic distribution. The most probable author is re-
turned. We use this method to avoid inferring the
document-dependent parameters separately for each
author, which is infeasible when many authors ex-
ist. A version that marginalises over these parame-
ters will be explored in future work.
4 Evaluation
We compare the performance of the methods on
two publicly-available datasets: (1) PAN?11: emails
with 72 authors (Argamon and Juola, 2011);
and (2) Blog: blogs with 19,320 authors (Schler et
al., 2006). These datasets represent realistic scenar-
ios of AA of user-generated texts with many can-
didate authors. For example, Chaski (2005) notes
a case where an employee who was terminated for
sending a racist email claimed that any person with
access to his computer could have sent the email.
Experimental Setup. Experiments on the PAN?11
dataset followed the setup of the PAN?11 competi-
tion (Argamon and Juola, 2011): We trained all the
methods on the given training subset, tuned the pa-
rameters according to the results on the given valida-
tion subset, and ran the tuned methods on the given
testing subset. In the Blog experiments, we used ten-
fold cross validation as in (Seroussi et al, 2011).
We used collapsed Gibbs sampling to train all the
topic models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), run-
ning 4 chains with a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. In
the PAN?11 experiments, we retained 8 samples per
chain with spacing of 100 iterations. In the Blog
experiments, we retained 1 sample per chain due to
runtime constraints. Since we cannot average topic
distribution estimates obtained from training sam-
ples due to topic exchangeability (Steyvers and Grif-
fiths, 2007), we averaged the distances and probabil-
ities calculated from the retained samples. For test
text sampling, we used a burn-in of 100 iterations
and averaged the parameter estimates over the next
100 iterations in a similar manner to Rosen-Zvi et
al. (2010). We found that these settings yield stable
results across different random seed values.
We found that the number of topics has a larger
impact on accuracy than other configurable pa-
rameters. Hence, we used symmetric topic pri-
ors, setting all the elements of ?(D) and ?(A)
to min{0.1, 5/T (D)} and min{0.1, 5/T (A)} respec-
tively.1 For all models, we set ?w = 0.01 for each
word w as the base measure for the prior of words in
topics. Since DADT allows us to encode our prior
knowledge that stopword use is indicative of author-
ship, we set ?(D)w = 0.01 ?  and ?(A)w = 0.01 + 
for all w, where w is a stopword.2 We set  = 0.009,
which improved accuracy by up to one percentage
point over using  = 0. Finally, we set ?(A) = 4.889
and ?(D) = 1.222 for DADT. This encodes our prior
1We tested Wallach et al?s (2009) method of obtaining
asymmetric priors, but found that it did not improve accuracy.
2We used the stopword list from www.lextek.com/
manuals/onix/stopwords2.html.

belief that 0.8 ? 0.15 of each document is com-
posed of author words. We found that this yields
better results than an uninformed uniform prior of
?(A) = ?(D) = 1 (Seroussi et al, 2012). In addition,
we set ?a = 1 for each author a, yielding smoothed
estimates for the corpus distribution of authors ?.
To fairly compare the topic-based methods, we
used the same overall number of topics for all the
topic models. We present only the results obtained
with the best topic settings: 100 for PAN?11 and 400
for Blog, with DADT?s author/document topic splits
being 90/10 for PAN?11, and 390/10 for Blog. These
splits allow DADT to de-noise the author represen-
tations by allocating document words to a relatively
small number of document topics. It is worth not-
ing that AT can be seen as an extreme version of
DADT, where all the topics are author topics. A fu-
ture extension is to learn the topic balance automat-
ically, e.g., in a similar manner to Teh et al?s (2006)
method of inferring the number of topics in LDA.
Results. Table 1 shows the results of our experi-
ments in terms of classification accuracy (i.e., the
percentage of test texts correctly attributed to their
author). The PAN?11 results are shown for the val-
idation and testing subsets, and the Blog results are
shown for a subset containing the 1,000 most prolific
authors and for the full dataset of 19,320 authors.
Our DADT model yielded the best results in all
cases (the differences between DADT and the other
methods are statistically significant according to a
paired two-tailed t-test with p < 0.05). We attribute
DADT?s superior performance to the de-noising ef-
fect of the disjoint topic sets, which appear to yield
author representations of higher predictive quality
than those of the other models.
As expected, AT significantly outperformed
LDA-H. On the other hand, AT-FA performed much
worse than all the other methods on PAN?11, prob-
ably because of the inherent noisiness in using the
same topics to model both authors and documents.
Hence, we did not run AT-FA on the Blog dataset.
DADT?s PAN?11 testing result is close to the
third-best accuracy from the PAN?11 competi-
tion (Argamon and Juola, 2011). However, to the
best of our knowledge, DADT obtained the best
accuracy for a fully-supervised method that uses
only unigram features. Specifically, Kourtis and
Stamatatos (2011), who obtained the highest accu-
racy (65.8%), assumed that all the test texts are
given to the classifier at the same time, and used
this additional information with a semi-supervised
method; while Kern et al (2011) and Tanguy et al
(2011), who obtained the second-best (64.2%) and
third-best (59.4%) accuracies respectively, used var-
ious feature types (e.g., features obtained from parse
trees). Further, preprocessing differences make it
hard to compare the methods on a level playing
field. Nonetheless, we note that extending DADT to
enable semi-supervised classification and additional
feature types are promising future work directions.
While all the methods yielded relatively low accu-
racies on Blog due to its size, topic-based methods
were more strongly affected than SVM by the transi-
tion from the 1,000 author subset to the full dataset.
This is probably because topic-based methods use a
single model, making them more sensitive to corpus
size than SVM?s one-versus-all setup that uses one
model per author. Notably, an oracle that chooses
the correct answer between SVM and DADT when
they disagree yields an accuracy of 37.15% on the
full dataset, suggesting it is worthwhile to explore
ensembles that combine the outputs of SVM and
DADT (we tried using DADT topics as additional
SVM features, but this did not outperform DADT).
5 Conclusion
This paper demonstrated the utility of using author-
aware topic models for AA: AT outperformed LDA,
and our DADT model outperformed LDA, AT and
SVMs in cases with noisy texts and many authors.
We hope that these results will inspire further re-
search into the application of topic models to AA.
