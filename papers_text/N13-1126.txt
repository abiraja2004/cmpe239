Abstract
We study multi-source transfer parsing for
resource-poor target languages; specifically
methods for target language adaptation of
delexicalized discriminative graph-based de-
pendency parsers. We first show how recent
insights on selective parameter sharing, based
on typological and language-family features,
can be applied to a discriminative parser by
carefully decomposing its model features. We
then show how the parser can be relexicalized
and adapted using unlabeled target language
data and a learning method that can incorporate
diverse knowledge sources through ambiguous
labelings. In the latter scenario, we exploit
two sources of knowledge: arc marginals de-
rived from the base parser in a self-training
algorithm, and arc predictions from multiple
transfer parsers in an ensemble-training algo-
rithm. Our final model outperforms the state of
the art in multi-source transfer parsing on 15
out of 16 evaluated languages.
1 Introduction
Many languages still lack access to core NLP tools,
such as part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers.
This is largely due to the reliance on fully supervised
learning methods, which require large quantities of
manually annotated training data. Recently, meth-
ods for cross-lingual transfer have appeared as a
promising avenue for overcoming this hurdle for both
part-of-speech tagging (Yarowsky et al, 2001; Das
and Petrov, 2011) and syntactic dependency parsing
(Hwa et al, 2005; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Ganchev
et al, 2009; McDonald et al, 2011; Naseem et al,
?Work primarily carried out while at Google, NY.
2012). While these methods do not yet compete with
fully supervised approaches, they can drastically out-
perform both unsupervised methods (Klein and Man-
ning, 2004) and weakly supervised methods (Naseem
et al, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).
A promising approach to cross-lingual transfer
of syntactic dependency parsers is to use multiple
source languages and to tie model parameters across
related languages. This idea was first explored for
weakly supervised learning (Cohen and Smith, 2009;
Snyder et al, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein,
2010) and recently by Naseem et al (2012) for multi-
source cross-lingual transfer. In particular, Naseem
et al showed that by selectively sharing parameters
based on typological features of each language, sub-
stantial improvements can be achieved, compared
to using a single set of parameters for all languages.
However, these methods all employ generative mod-
els with strong independence assumptions and weak
feature representations, which upper bounds their ac-
curacy far below that of feature-rich discriminative
parsers (McDonald et al, 2005; Nivre, 2008).
In this paper, we improve upon the state of the art
in cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsers from
multiple source languages by adapting feature-rich
discriminatively trained parsers to a specific target
language. First, in ?4 we show how selective sharing
of model parameters based on typological traits can
be incorporated into a delexicalized discriminative
graph-based parsing model. This requires a careful
decomposition of features into language-generic and
language-specific sets in order to tie specific target
language parameters to their relevant source language
counterparts. The resulting parser outperforms the
method of Naseem et al (2012) on 12 out of 16 eval-
uated languages. Second, in ?5 we introduce a train-
1061
ing method that can incorporate diverse knowledge
sources through ambiguously predicted labelings of
unlabeled target language data. This permits effective
relexicalization and target language adaptation of the
transfer parser. Here, we experiment with two differ-
ent knowledge sources: arc sets, which are filtered by
marginal probabilities from the cross-lingual transfer
parser, are used in an ambiguity-aware self-training
algorithm (?5.2); these arc sets are then combined
with the predictions of a different transfer parser in an
ambiguity-aware ensemble-training algorithm (?5.3).
The resulting parser provides significant improve-
ments over a strong baseline parser and achieves a
13% relative error reduction on average with respect
to the best model of Naseem et al (2012), outper-
forming it on 15 out of the 16 evaluated languages.
2 Multi-Source Delexicalized Transfer
The methods proposed in this paper fall into the delex-
icalized transfer approach to multilingual syntactic
parsing (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; McDonald et al,
2011; Cohen et al, 2011; S?gaard, 2011). In contrast
to annotation projection approaches (Yarowsky et al,
2001; Hwa et al, 2005; Ganchev et al, 2009; Spreyer
and Kuhn, 2009), delexicalized transfer methods do
not rely on any bitext. Instead, a parser is trained
on annotations in a source language, relying solely
on features that are available in both the source
and the target language, such as ?universal? part-of-
speech tags (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Naseem et al,
2010; Petrov et al, 2012), cross-lingual word clusters
(T?ckstr?m et al, 2012) or type-level features derived
from bilingual dictionaries (Durrett et al, 2012).1
This parser is then directly used to parse the target
language. For languages with similar typology, this
method can be quite accurate, especially when com-
pared to purely unsupervised methods. For instance,
a parser trained on English with only part-of-speech
features can correctly parse the Greek sentence in Fig-
ure 1, even without knowledge of the lexical items
since the sequence of part-of-speech tags determines
the syntactic structure almost unambiguously.
Learning with multiple languages has been shown
to benefit unsupervised learning (Cohen and Smith,
1Note that T?ckstr?m et al (2012) and Durrett et al (2012)
do require bitext or a bilingual dictionary. The same holds for
most cross-lingual representations, e.g., Klementiev et al (2012).

2009; Snyder et al, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and
Klein, 2010). Annotations in multiple languages
can be combined in delexicalized transfer as well, as
long as the parser features are available across the in-
volved languages. This idea was explored by McDon-
ald et al (2011), who showed that target language
accuracy can be improved by simply concatenating
delexicalized treebanks in multiple languages. In
similar work, Cohen et al (2011) proposed a mixture
model in which the parameters of a generative target
language parser is expressed as a linear interpola-
tion of source language parameters, whereas S?gaard
(2011) showed that target side language models can
be used to selectively subsample training sentences
to improve accuracy. Recently, inspired by the phylo-
genetic prior of Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010),
S?gaard and Wulff (2012) proposed ? among other
ideas ? a typologically informed weighting heuristic
for linearly interpolating source language parameters.
However, this weighting did not provide significant
improvements over uniform weighting.
The aforementioned approaches work well for
transfer between similar languages. However, their
assumptions cease to hold for typologically divergent
languages; a target language can rarely be described
as a linear combination of data or model parameters
from a set of source languages, as languages tend
to share varied typological traits; this critical insight
is discussed further in ?4. To account for this issue,
Naseem et al (2012) recently introduced a novel gen-
erative model of dependency parsing, in which the
generative process is factored into separate steps for
the selection of dependents and their ordering. The
parameters used in the selection step are all language
independent, capturing only head-dependent attach-
ment preferences. In the ordering step, however, pa-
rameters are selectively shared between subsets of

source languages based on typological features of
the languages extracted from WALS ? the World
Atlas of Language Structures (Dryer and Haspelmath,
2011) ? as shown in Table 1. In the transfer scenario,
where no supervision is available in the target lan-
guage, this parser achieves the hitherto best published
results across a number of languages; in particular
for target languages with a word order divergent from
the source languages.
However, the generative model of Naseem et al is
quite impoverished. In the fully supervised setting,
it obtains substantially lower accuracies compared
to a standard arc-factored graph-based parser (Mc-
Donald et al, 2005). Averaged across 16 languages,2
the generative model trained with full supervision on
the target language obtains an accuracy of 67.1%. A
comparable lexicalized discriminative arc-factored
model (McDonald et al, 2005) obtains 84.1%. Even
when delexicalized, this model reaches 78.9%. This
gap in supervised accuracy holds for all 16 languages.
Thus, while selective sharing is a powerful device for
transferring parsers across languages, the underly-
ing generative model used by Naseem et al (2012)
restricts its potential performance.
3 Basic Models and Experimental Setup
Inspired by the superiority of discriminative graph-
based parsing in the supervised scenario, we inves-
tigate whether the insights of Naseem et al (2012)
on selective parameter sharing can be incorporated
into such models in the transfer scenario. We first re-
view the basic graph-based parser framework and the

experimental setup that we will use throughout. We
then delve into details on how to incorporate selec-
tive sharing in this model in ?4. In ?5, we show how
learning with ambiguous labelings in this parser can
be used for further target language adaptation, both
through self-training and through ensemble-training.
3.1 Discriminative Graph-Based Parser
Let x denote an input sentence and let y ? Y(x)
denote a dependency tree, where Y(x) is the set of
well-formed dependency trees spanning x. Hence-
forth, we restrictY(x) to projective dependency trees,
but all our methods are equally applicable in the non-
projective case. Provided a vector of model parame-
ters ?, the probability of a dependency tree y ? Y(x),
conditioned on a sentence x, has the following form:
p?(y | x) =
exp
{
?>?(x, y)
}
?
y??Y(x) exp {?
>?(x, y?)}
.
Without loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to
first-order models, where the feature function ?(x, y)
factors over individual arcs (h,m) in y, such that
?(x, y) =
?
(h,m)?y
?(x, h,m) ,
where h ? [0, |x|] and m ? [1, |x|] are the indices
of the head word and the dependent word of the
arc; h = 0 represents a dummy ROOT token. The
model parameters are estimated by maximizing the
log-likelihood of the training dataD = {(xi, yi)}ni=1,
L(?;D) =
n?
i=1
log p?(yi | xi) .
We use the standard gradient-based L-BFGS algo-
rithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to maximize the log-
likelihood. Eisner?s algorithm (Eisner, 1996) is used
for inference of the Viterbi parse and arc-marginals.
3.2 Data Sets and Experimental Setup
To facilitate comparison with the state of the art, we
use the same treebanks and experimental setup as
Naseem et al (2012). Notably, we use the map-
ping proposed by Naseem et al (2010) to map from
fine-grained treebank specific part-of-speech tags to
coarse-grained ?universal? tags, rather than the more
recent mapping proposed by Petrov et al (2012). For

each target language evaluated, the treebanks of the
remaining languages are used as labeled training data,
while the target language treebank is used for testing
only (in ?5 a different portion of the target language
treebank is additionally used as unlabeled training
data). We refer the reader to Naseem et al (2012) for
detailed information on the different treebanks. Due
to divergent treebank annotation guidelines, which
makes fine-grained evaluation difficult, all results
are evaluated in terms of unlabeled attachment score
(UAS). In line with Naseem et al (2012), we use gold
part-of-speech tags and evaluate only on sentences
of length 50 or less excluding punctuation.
3.3 Baseline Models
We compare our models to two multi-source base-
line models. The first baseline, NBG, is the gener-
ative model with selective parameter sharing from
Naseem et al (2012).3 This model is trained without
target language data, but we investigate the use of
such data in ?5.4. The second baseline, Delex, is a
delexicalized projective version of the well-known
graph-based MSTParser (McDonald et al, 2005).
The feature templates used by this model are shown
to the left in Figure 2. Note that there is no selective
sharing in this model.
The second and third columns of Table 2 show the
unlabeled attachment scores of the baseline models
for each target language. We see that Delex performs
well on target languages that are related to the major-
ity of the source languages. However, for languages
3Model ?D-,To? in Table 2 from Naseem et al (2012).
that diverge from the Indo-European majority family,
the selective sharing model, NBG, achieves substan-
tially higher accuracies.
4 Feature-Based Selective Sharing
The results for the baseline models are not surpris-
ing considering the feature templates used by Delex.
There are two fundamental issues with these fea-
tures when used for direct transfer. First, all but
one template include the arc direction. Second,
some features are sensitive to local word order; e.g.,
[d? l]? h.p? h+1.p? m?1.p? m.p, which models
direction as well as word order in the local contexts
of the head and the dependent. Such features do not
transfer well across typologically different languages.
In order to verify that these issues are the cause of
the poor performance of the Delex model, we remove
all directional features and all features that model
local word order from Delex. The feature templates
of the resulting Bare model are shown in the center
of Figure 2. These features only model selectional
preferences and dependency length, analogously to
the selection component of NBG. The performance
of Bare is shown in the fourth column of Table 2.
The removal of most of the features results in a per-
formance drop on average. However, for languages
outside of the Indo-European family, Bare is often
more accurate, especially for Basque, Hungarian and
Japanese, which supports our hypothesis.
4.1 Sharing Based on Typological Features
After removing all directional features, we now care-
fully reintroduce them. Inspired by Naseem et al

Table 2: Unlabeled attachment scores of the multi-source
transfer models. Boldface numbers indicate the best result
per language. Underlined numbers indicate languages
whose group is not represented in the training data (these
default to Share under Similarity and Family). NBG is the
?D-,To? model in Table 2 from Naseem et al (2012).
(2012), we make use of the typological features from
WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2011), listed in Ta-
ble 1, to selectively share directional parameters be-
tween languages. As a natural first attempt at sharing
parameters, one might consider forming the cross-
product of all features of Delex with all WALS prop-
erties, similarly to a common domain adaptation tech-
nique (Daum? III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009).
However, this approach has two issues. First, it re-
sults in a huge number of features, making the model
prone to overfitting. Second, and more critically, it
ties together languages via features for which they
are not typologically similar. Consider English and
French, which are both prepositional and thus have
the same value for WALS property 85A. These lan-
guages will end up sharing a parameter for the feature
[d? l]?h.p = NOUN?m.p = ADJ?w.85A; yet they
have the exact opposite direction of attachment pref-
erence when it comes to nouns and adjectives. This
problem applies to any method for parameter mixing
that treats all the parameters as equal.
Like Naseem et al (2012), we instead share pa-
rameters more selectively. Our strategy is to use the
relevant part-of-speech tags of the head and depen-
dent to select which parameters to share, based on
very basic linguistic knowledge. The resulting fea-
tures are shown to the right in Figure 2. For example,
there is a shared directional feature that models the or-
der of Subject, Object and Verb by conjoining WALS
feature 81A with the arc direction and an indicator
feature that fires only if the head is a verb and the de-
pendent is a noun. These features would not be very
useful by themselves, so we combine them with the
Bare features. The accuracy of the resulting Share
model is shown in column five of Table 2. Although
this model still performs worse than NBG, it is an
improvement over the Delex baseline and actually
outperforms the former on 5 out of the 16 languages.
4.2 Sharing Based on Language Groups
While Share models selectional preferences and arc
directions for a subset of dependency relations, it
does not capture the rich local word order informa-
tion captured by Delex. We now consider two ways of
selectively including such information based on lan-
guage similarity. While more complex sharing could
be explored (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010), we
use a flat structure and consider two simple groupings
of the source and target languages.
First, the Similar model consists of the features
used by Share together with the features from Delex
in Figure 2. The latter are conjoined with an indicator
feature that fires only when the source and target
languages share values for all the WALS features in
Table 1. This is accomplished by adding the template
f? [w.81A? w.85A? w.86A? w.87A? w.88A]
for each template f in Delex. This groups: 1) Cata-
lan, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish; 2) Bulgarian,
Czech and English; 3) Dutch, German and Greek;
and 4) Japanese and Turkish. The remaining lan-
guages do not share all WALS properties with at
least one source language and thus revert to Share,
since they cannot exploit these grouped features.
Second, instead of grouping languages according
to WALS, the Family model is based on a simple
subdivision into Indo-European languages (Bulgar-
ian, Catalan, Czech, Greek, English, Spanish, Italian,
1065
Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish) and Altaic languages
(Japanese, Turkish). This is accomplished with in-
dicator features analogous to those used in Similar.
The remaining languages are again treated as isolates
and revert to Similar.
The results for these models are given in the last
two columns of Table 2. We see that by adding these
rich features back into the fold, but having them fire
only for languages in the same group, we can sig-
nificantly increase the performance ? from 57.4%
to 62.0% on average when considering Family. If
we consider our original Delex baseline, we see an
absolute improvement of 6.9% on average and a rela-
tive error reduction of 15%. Particular gains are seen
for non-Indo-European languages; e.g., Japanese in-
creases from 38.9% to 65.9%. Furthermore, Family
achieves a 7% relative error reduction over the NBG
baseline and outperforms it on 12 of the 16 languages.
This shows that a discriminative graph-based parser
can achieve higher accuracies compared to generative
models when the features are carefully constructed.
5 Target Language Adaptation
While some higher-level linguistic properties of the
target language have been incorporated through se-
lective sharing, so far no features specific to the target
language have been employed. Cohen et al (2011)
and Naseem et al (2012) have shown that using
expectation-maximization (EM) to this end can in
some cases bring substantial accuracy gains. For dis-
criminative models, self-training has been shown to
be quite effective for adapting monolingual parsers to
new domains (McClosky et al, 2006), as well as for
relexicalizing delexicalized parsers using unlabeled
target language data (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). Sim-
ilarly T?ckstr?m (2012) used self-training to adapt a
multi-source direct transfer named-entity recognizer
(T?ckstr?m et al, 2012) to different target languages,
?relexicalizing? the model with word cluster features.
However, as discussed in ?5.2, standard self-training
is not optimal for target language adaptation.
5.1 Ambiguity-Aware Training
In this section, we propose a related training method:
ambiguity-aware training. In this setting a discrimi-
native probabilistic model is induced from automat-
ically inferred ambiguous labelings over unlabeled
target language data, in place of gold-standard depen-
dency trees. The ambiguous labelings can combine
multiple sources of evidence to guide the estimation
or simply encode the underlying uncertainty from the
base parser. This uncertainty is marginalized out dur-
ing training. The structure of the output space, e.g.,
projectivity and single-headedness constraints, along
with regularities in the feature space, can together
guide the estimation, similar to what occurs with the
expectation-maximization algorithm.
Core to this method is the idea of an ambiguous
labeling y?(x) ? Y(x), which encodes a set of pos-
sible dependency trees for an input sentence x. In
subsequent sections we describe how to define such
labelings. Critically, y?(x) should be large enough to
capture the correct labeling, but on the other hand
small enough to provide concrete guidance for model
estimation. Ideally, y?(x) will capture heterogenous
knowledge that can aid the parser in target language
adaptation. In a first-order arc-factored model, we
define y?(x) in terms of a collection of ambiguous
arc setsA(x) = {A(x,m)}|x|m=1, whereA(x,m) de-
notes the set of ambiguously specified heads for the
mth token in x. Then, y?(x) is defined as the set of
all projective dependency trees spanning x that can
be assembled from the arcs in A(x).
Methods for learning with ambiguous labelings
have previously been proposed in the context of
multi-class classification (Jin and Ghahramani, 2002),
sequence-labeling (Dredze et al, 2009), log-linear
LFG parsing (Riezler et al, 2002), as well as for
discriminative reranking of generative constituency
parsers (Charniak and Johnson, 2005). In contrast to
Dredze et al, who allow for weights to be assigned
to partial labels, we assume that the ambiguous arcs
are weighted uniformly. For target language adapta-
tion, these weights would typically be derived from
unreliable sources and we do not want to train the
model to simply mimic their beliefs. Furthermore,
with this assumption, learning is simply achieved
by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood of the
ambiguous training set D? = {(xi, y?(xi)}ni=1,
L(?; D?) =

In maximizing the marginal log-likelihood, the model
is free to distribute probability mass among the trees
1066
in the ambiguous labeling to its liking, as long as the
marginal log-likelihood improves. The same objec-
tive function is used by Riezler et al (2002) and Char-
niak and Johnson (2005). A key difference is that in
these works, the ambiguity is constrained through a
supervised signal, while we use ambiguity as a way
to achieve self-training, using the base-parser itself,
or some other potentially noisy knowledge source as
the sole constraints. Note that we have introduced
an `2-regularizer, weighted by ?. This is important
as we are now training lexicalized target language
models which can easily overfit. In all experiments,
we optimize parameters with L-BFGS. Note also that
the marginal likelihood is non-concave, so that we
are only guaranteed to find a local maximum.
5.2 Ambiguity-Aware Self-Training
In standard self-training ? hereafter referred to as
Viterbi self-training ? a base parser is used to la-
bel each unlabeled sentence with its most probable
parse tree to create a self-labeled data set, which is
subsequently used to train a supervised parser. There
are two reasons why this simple approach may work.
First, if the base parser?s errors are not too systematic
and if the self-training model is not too expressive,
self-training can reduce the variance on the new do-
main. Second, self-training allows for features in the
new domain with low support ? or no support in the
case of lexicalized features ? in the base parser to
be ?filled in? by exploiting correlations in the feature
representation. However, a potential pitfall of this
approach is that the self-trained parser is encouraged
to blindly mimic the base parser, which leads to error
reinforcement. This may be particularly problematic
when relexicalizing a transfer parser, since the lexical
features provide the parser with increased power and
thereby an increased risk of overfitting to the noise.
To overcome this potential problem, we propose an
ambiguity-aware self-training (AAST) method that is
able to take the noise of the base parser into account.
We use the arc-marginals of the base parser to
construct the ambiguous labeling y?(x) for a sentence
x. For each token m ? [1, |x|], we first sort the set of
arcs in which m is the dependent, {(h,m)}|x|h=0, by
the marginal probabilities of the arcs:
p?(h,m | x) =
?
{y?Y(x) | (h,m)?y}
p?(y | x)
We next construct the ambiguous arc set A(x,m) by
adding arcs (h,m) in order of decreasing probability,
until their cumulative probability exceeds ?, i.e. until
?
(h,m)?A(x,m)
p?(h,m | x) ? ? .
Lower values of ? result in more aggressive pruning,
with ? = 0 corresponding to including no arc and
? = 1 corresponding to including all arcs. We always
add the highest scoring tree y? to y?(x) to ensure that
it contains at least one complete projective tree.
Figure 3 outlines an example of how (and why)
AAST works. In the Greek example, the genitive
phrase ? pi??????? ?????? (the stay of vessels) is
incorrectly analyzed as a flat noun phrase. This is not
surprising given that the base parser simply observes
this phrase as DET NOUN NOUN. However, looking
at the arc marginals we can see that the correct anal-
ysis is available during AAST, although the actual
marginal probabilities are quite misleading. Further-
more, the genitive noun ?????? also appears in other
less ambiguous contexts, where the base parser cor-
rectly predicts it to modify a noun and not a verb.
This allows the training process to add weight to the
corresponding lexical feature pairing ?????? with a
noun head and away from the feature pairing it with
a verb. The resulting parser correctly predicts the
genitive construction.
5.3 Ambiguity-Aware Ensemble-Training
While ambiguous labelings can be used as a means
to improve self-training, any information that can
be expressed as hard arc-factored constraints can be
incorporated, including linguistic expert knowledge
and annotation projected via bitext. Here we explore
another natural source of information: the predic-
tions of other transfer parsers. It is well known that
combining several diverse predictions in an ensem-
ble often leads to improved predictions. However, in
most ensemble methods there is typically no learning
involved once the base learners have been trained
(Sagae and Lavie, 2006). An exception is the method
of Sagae and Tsujii (2007), who combine the outputs
of many parsers on unlabeled data to train a parser
for a new domain. However, in that work the learner
is not exposed to the underlying ambiguity of the
base parsers; it is only given the Viterbi parse of the
combination system as the gold standard. In contrast,

Figure 3: An example of ambiguity-aware self-training
(AAST) on a sentence from the Greek self-training data.
The sentence roughly translates to The stay of vessels
is permitted only for the day. Top: Arcs from the base
model?s Viterbi parse are shown above the sentence. When
only the part-of-speech tags are observed, the parser tends
to treat everything to the left of the verb as a head-final
noun phrase. The dashed arcs below the sentence are
the arcs for the true genitive construction stay of vessels.
These arcs and the corresponding incorrect arcs in the
Viterbi parse are marked with their marginal probabilities.
Middle: The ambiguous labeling y?(x), which is used
as supervision in AAST. Additional non-Viterbi arcs are
present in y?(x); for clarity, these are not shown. When
learning with AAST, probability mass will be pushed to-
wards any tree consistent with y?(x). Marginal probabili-
ties are ignored at this stage, so that all arcs in y?(x) are
treated as equals. Bottom: The Viterbi parse of the AAST
model, which has selected the correct arcs from y?(x).
we propose an ambiguity-aware ensemble-training
(AAET) method that treats the union of the ensemble
predictions for a sentence x as an ambiguous labeling
y?(x). An additional advantage of this approach is
that the ensemble is compiled into a single model
and therefore does not require multiple models to be
stored and used at runtime.
It is straightforward to construct y?(x) from multi-
ple parsers. Let Ak(x,m) be the set of arcs for the
mth token in x according to the kth parser in the en-
semble. When arc-marginals are used to construct the
ambiguity set, |Ak(x,m)| ? 1, but when the Viterbi-
parse is used, Ak(x,m) is a singleton. We next form
A(x,m) =
?
kAk(x,m) as the ensemble arc ambi-
guity set from which y?(x) is assembled. In this study,
we combine the arc sets of two base parsers: first, the
arc-marginal ambiguity set of the base parser (?5.2);
and second, the Viterbi arc set from the NBG parser
of Naseem et al (2012) in Table 2.4 Thus, the lat-
ter will have singleton arc ambiguity sets, but when
combined with the arc-marginal ambiguity sets of
our base parser, the result will encode uncertainty
derived from both parsers.
5.4 Adaptation Experiments
We now study the different approaches to target lan-
guage adaptation empirically. As in Naseem et al
(2012), we use the CoNLL training sets, stripped of
all dependency information, as the unlabeled target
language data in our experiments. We use the Family
model as the base parser, which is used to label the
unlabeled target data with the Viterbi parses as well
as with the ambiguous labelings. The final model
is then trained on this data using standard lexical-
ized features (McDonald et al, 2005). Since labeled
training data is unavailable in the target language,
we cannot tune any hyper-parameters and simply set
?= 1 and ?= 0.95 throughout. Although the latter
may suggest that y?(x) contains a high degree of am-
biguity, in reality, the marginal distributions of the
base model have low entropy and after filtering with
? = 0.95, the average number of potential heads per
dependent ranges from 1.4 to 3.2, depending on the
target language.
The ambiguity-aware training methods, that is
ambiguity-aware self-training (AAST) and ambiguity-
aware ensemble-training (AAET), are compared to
three baseline systems. First, NBG+EM is the gen-
erative model of Naseem et al (2012) trained with
expectation-maximization on additional unlabeled
target language text. Second, Family is the best dis-
criminative model from the previous section. Third,
Viterbi is the basic Viterbi self-training model. The
results of each of these models are shown in Table 3.
There are a number of things that can be observed.
First, Viterbi self-training helps slightly on average,
but the gains are not consistent and there are even
drops in accuracy for some languages. Second, AAST
outperforms the Viterbi variant on all languages and

nearly always improves on the base parser, although
it sees a slight drop for Italian. AAST improves the
accuracy over the base model by 2% absolute on av-
erage and by as much as 5% absolute for Turkish.
Comparing this model to the NBG+EM baseline, we
observe an improvement by 3.6% absolute, outper-
forming it on 14 of the 16 languages. Furthermore,
ambiguity-aware self-training appears to help more
than expectation-maximization for generative (unlex-
icalized) models. Naseem et al observed an increase
from 59.3% to 60.4% on average by adding unlabeled
target language data and the gains were not consistent
across languages. AAST, on the other hand, achieves
consistent gains, rising from 62.0% to 64.0% on av-
erage. Third, as shown in the rightmost column of
Table 3, ambiguity-aware ensemble-training is indeed
a successful strategy; AAET outperforms the previ-
ous best self-trained model on 13 and NB&G+EM
on 15 out of 16 languages. The relative error reduc-
tion with respect to the base Family model is 9% on
average, while the average reduction with respect to
NBG+EM is 13%.
Before concluding, two additional points are worth
making. First, further gains may potentially be
achievable with feature-rich discriminative models.
While the best generative transfer model of Naseem
et al (2012) approaches its upper-bounding super-
vised accuracy (60.4% vs. 67.1%), our relaxed self-
training model is still far below its supervised coun-
terpart (64.0% vs. 84.1%). One promising statistic
along these lines is that the oracle accuracy for the
ambiguous labelings of AAST is 75.7%, averaged
across languages, which suggests that other training
algorithms, priors or constraints could improve the
accuracy substantially. Second, relexicalization is a
key component of self-training. If we use delexical-
ized features during self-training, we only observe a
small average improvement from 62.0% to 62.1%.
6 Conclusions
We contributed to the understanding of multi-source
syntactic transfer in several complementary ways.
First, we showed how selective parameter sharing,
based on typological features and language family
membership, can be incorporated in a discriminative
graph-based model of dependency parsing. We then
showed how ambiguous labelings can be used to in-
tegrate heterogenous knowledge sources in parser
training. Two instantiations of this framework were
explored. First, an ambiguity-aware self-training
method that can be used to effectively relexicalize
and adapt a delexicalized transfer parser using unla-
beled target language data. Second, an ambiguity-
aware ensemble-training method, in which predic-
tions from different parsers can be incorporated and
further adapted. On average, our best model provides
a relative error reduction of 13% over the state-of-
the-art model of Naseem et al (2012), outperforming
it on 15 out of 16 evaluated languages.
