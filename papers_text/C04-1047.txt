Abstract
This paper addressees the problem of eliminat-
ing unsatisfactory outputs from machine trans-
lation (MT) systems. The authors intend to
eliminate unsatisfactory MT outputs by using
confidence measures. Confidence measures for
MT outputs include the rank-sum-based confi-
dence measure (RSCM) for statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems. RSCM can be ap-
plied to non-SMT systems but does not always
work well on them. This paper proposes an
alternative RSCM that adopts a mixture of the
N-best lists from multiple MT systems instead
of a single-system?s N-best list in the exist-
ing RSCM. In most cases, the proposed RSCM
proved to work better than the existing RSCM
on two non-SMT systems and to work as well
as the existing RSCM on an SMT system.
1 Introduction
This paper addresses the challenging problem of
eliminating unsatisfactory outputs from machine
translation (MT) systems, which are subsystems of
a speech-to-speech machine translation (S2SMT)
system. The permissible range of translation quality
by MT/S2SMT systems depends on the user. Some
users permit only perfect translations, while other
users permit even translations with flawed grammar.
Unsatisfactory MT outputs are those whose transla-
tion quality is worse than the level the user can per-
mit.
In this paper, the authors intend to eliminate un-
satisfactory outputs by using confidence measures
for MT outputs. The confidence measures1 indicate
how perfect/satisfactory the MT outputs are. In the
? This research was supported in part by the Ministry of Public
Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications,
Japan.
1These confidence measures are a kind of automatic evalu-
ator such as mWER (Niessen et al, 2000) and BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2001). While mWER and BLEU cannot be used online,
these confidence measures can. This is because the former are
based on reference translations, while the latter is not.
discipline of MT, confidence measures for MT out-
puts have rarely been investigated.
The few existing confidence measures include
the rank-sum-based confidence measure (RSCM)
for statistical machine translation (SMT) systems,
Crank in (Ueffing et al, 2003). The basic idea
of this confidence measure is to roughly calculate
the word posterior probability by using ranks of
MT outputs in an N-best list from an SMT system.
In the discipline of non-parametric statistical test,
ranks of numerical values are commonly used in-
stead of the numerical values themselves for statis-
tical tests. In the case of the existing RSCM, the
ranks of probabilities of MT outputs in the N-best
list were used instead of the probabilities of the out-
puts themselves. The existing RSCM scores each
word in an MT output by summing the comple-
mented ranks of candidates in the N-best list that
contain the same word in a Levenshtein-aligned po-
sition (Levenshtein, 1966). When the confidence
values of all words in the MT output are larger than
a fixed threshold, the MT output is judged as cor-
rect/perfect. Otherwise, the output is judged as in-
correct/imperfect.

on types of MT systems other than SMT systems.
Figure 1 shows the differences among the perfor-
mances, indicated by the Receiver Operating Char-
acteristics (ROC) curve (Section 4.1), of the exist-
ing RSCM on each of three MT systems (Section
4.2.1): D3, HPAT, and SAT (Doi and Sumita, 2003;
Imamura et al, 2003; Watanabe et al, 2003). Only
SAT is an SMT system; the others are not. The ideal
ROC curve is a square (0,1), (1,1), (1,0); thus, the
closer the curve is to a square, the better the perfor-
mance of the RSCM is. The performances of the
existing RSCM on the non-SMT systems, D3 and
HPAT, are much worse than that on the SMT sys-
tem, SAT.
The performance of the existing RSCM depends
on the goodness/density of MT outputs in the N-
best list from the system. However, the system?s
N-best list does not always give a good approxi-
mation of the total summation of the probability
of all candidate translations given the source sen-
tence/utterance. The N-best list is expected to ap-
proximate the total summation as closely as possi-
ble.
This paper proposes a method that eliminates
unsatisfactory top output by using an alternative
RSCM based on a mixture of N-best lists from mul-
tiple MT systems (Figure 2). The elimination sys-
tem is intended to be used in the selector architec-
ture, as in (Akiba et al, 2002). The total transla-
tion quality of the selector architecture proved to be
better than the translation quality of each element
MT system. The final output from the selection sys-
tem is the best among the satisfactory top2 outputs
from the elimination system. In the case of Fig-
ure 2, the selection system can receive zero to three
top MT outputs. When the selection system receive
fewer than two top MT outputs, the selection sys-
tem merely passes a null output or the one top MT
output.
The proposed RSCM differs from the existing
RSCM in its N-best list. The proposed RSCM re-
2To distinguish the best output from the selection system,
the MT output in the first place in each N-best list (e.g., N-best
lista in Figure 2 ) refers to the top MT output.

all M-best lists in the order of the average product
(Section 3.2) of the scores of a language model and
a translation model (Akiba et al, 2002). This sorted
mixture is used instead of the system?s N-best list in
the existing RSCM.
To experimentally evaluate the proposed RSCM,
the authors applied the proposed RSCM and the ex-
isting RSCM to a test set of the Basic Travel Ex-
pression Corpus (Takezawa et al, 2002). The pro-
posed RSCM proved to work better than the exist-
ing RSCM on the non-SMT systems and to work as
well as the existing RSCM on the SMT system.
The next section outlines the existing RSCM.
Section 3 proposes our RSCM. Experimental results
are shown and discussed in Section 4. Finally, our
conclusions are presented in Section 5.
2 The Existing RSCM
The existing confidence measures include the rank-
sum-based confidence measure (RSCM) for SMT
systems (Ueffing et al, 2003). The basic idea of
this RSCM is to roughly calculate the word poste-
rior probability by using ranks of MT outputs in the
N-best list of an SMT system. That is, the ranks of
probabilities of MT outputs in the N-best list were
used instead of the probabilities of the outputs them-
selves, as in the non-parametric statistical test.
Hereafter, e?I1 and wIn1 denote the top output2
and the n-th best output in the N-best list, respec-
tively. e?i denotes the i-th word in the top MT output
e?I1. Li(e?I1, wIn1 ) denote the Levenshtein alignment3
(Levenshtein, 1966) of e?i on the n-th best output
wIn1 according to the top output e?I1. The existing
RSCM of the word e?i is the sum of the ranks of MT
outputs in an N-best list containing the word e?i in a
position that is aligned to i in the Levenshtein align-
ment, which is normalized by the total rank sum:
Crank(e?i) =
?N
n=1(N ? n) ? ?(e?i, Li(e?I1, wIn1 ))
N(N + 1)/2 ,
where ?(?, ?) is the Kronecker function, that is, if
words/morphemes x and y are the same, ?(x, y) =
1; otherwise, ?(x, y) = 0. Thus, only in the case
where e?i and Li(e?I1, wIn1 ) are the same, the rank of
the MT output wIn1 , N ? n, is summed. In the
calculation of Crank, N ? n is summed instead of
the rank n because ranks near the top of the N-best
list contribute more to the score Crank.
3This is the word on the n-th best output wIn1 , aligned with
the i-th word e?i, in the calculation of edit distance from the top
MT output e?I1 to the n-th best output wIn1 .
In this paper, the calculation of Crank is slightly
modified to sum N ? n + 1 so that the total sum-
mation is equal to N(N + 1)/2. Moreover, when
there are MT outputs that have the same score, such
MT outputs are assigned the average rank as in the
discipline of non-parametric statistical test.
As shown in Section 1, the existing RSCM does
not always work well on types of MT systems other
than SMT systems. This is because the system?s
N-best list does not always give a good approxi-
mation of the total summation of the probability
of all candidate translations given the source sen-
tence/utterance. The N-best list is expected to ap-
proximate the total summation as closely as possi-
ble.
3 Proposed Method
In this section, the authors propose a method that
eliminates unsatisfactory top output by using an al-
ternative RSCM based on a mixture of N-best lists
from multiple MT systems. The judgment that
the top output is satisfactory is based on the same
threshold comparison as the judgment that the top
output is perfect, as mentioned in Section 1. The
elimination system and the alternative RSCM are
explained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.
3.1 Elimination system
This section proposes a method that eliminates
unsatisfactory top outputs by using an alternative
RSCM based on a mixture of N-best lists from mul-
tiple MT systems (Figure 3). This elimination sys-
tem is intended to be used in the selector architec-
ture (Figure 2). The elimination system receives
an M-best list from each element MT system and
outputs only top2 outputs whose translation quality
is better than or as good as that which the user can
permit. In the case of Figure 3, the number of MT
systems is three; thus, the elimination system can
output zero to three top MT outputs, which depends
on the number of the eliminated top outputs.

Figure 3: Proposed RSCM
The proposed elimination system judges whether
a top output is satisfactory by using a threshold
comparison, as in (Ueffing et al, 2003). When
the confidence values of all words in the top out-
put, which are calculated by using the alternative
RSCM explained in Section 3.2, are larger than a
fixed threshold, the top output is judged as satisfac-
tory. Otherwise, the top output is judged as unsatis-
factory. The threshold was optimized on a develop-
ment corpus.
3.2 The proposed RSCM
The proposed RSCM is an extension of the existing
RSCM outlined in Section 2. The proposed RSCM
differs from the existing RSCM in the adopted N-
best list (Figure 3). The proposed RSCM receives
an M-best list from each element MT system. Next
the proposed RSCM sorts the mixture of all the MT
outputs in the order of the average product of the
scores of a language model and a translation model
(Akiba et al, 2002). This sorted mixture is alter-
natively used instead of the system?s N-best list in
the existing RSCM. That is, the proposed RSCM
checks whether it accepts/rejects each top MT out-
put in the original M-best lists by using the sorted
mixture; on the other hand, the existing RSCM
checks whether it accepts/rejects the top MT out-
put in the system?s N-best list by using the system?s
N-best.
For scoring MT outputs, the proposed RSCM
uses a score based on a translation model called
IBM4 (Brown et al, 1993) (TM-score) and a score
based on a language model for the translation tar-
get language (LM-score). As Akiba et al (2002)
reported, the products of TM-scores and LM-scores
are statistical variables. Even in the case where the
translation model (TM) and the language model for
the translation target language (LM) are trained on
a sub-corpus of the same size, changing the training
corpus also changes the TM-score, the LM-score,
and their product. Each pair of TM-score and LM-
score differently order the MT outputs.
For robust scoring, the authors adopt the multi-
ple scoring technique presented in (Akiba et al,
2002). The multiple scoring technique prepares

multiple subsets of the full parallel corpus accord-
ing to k-fold cross validation (Mitchell, 1997) and
trains both TM and LM on each subset. Each
MT output is scored in k ways. For example, the
full parallel corpus C is divided into three subsets
Vi (i = 0, 1, 2). For each i, the proposed method
trains a translation model TMi on Ci (= C ? Vi)
and a language model LMi on the target-language
part of Ci (Figure 4). MT outputs in the mixture are
sorted by using the average of the product scores
by TMi and LMi for each i. In (Akiba et al, 2002),
this multiple scoring technique was shown to select
the best translation better than a single scoring tech-
nique that uses TM and LM trained from a full cor-
pus.
4 Experimental Comparison
The authors conducted an experimental compari-
son between the proposed RSCM and the existing
RSCM in the framework of the elimination system.
The task of both RSCMs was to judge whether each
top2 MT output from an MT system is satisfactory,
that is, whether the translation quality of the top MT
output is better than or as good as that which the
user can permit.
In this experiment, the translation quality of MT
outputs was assigned one of four grades: A, B,
C, or D as follows: (A) Perfect: no problems in
either information or grammar; (B) Fair: easy-to-
understand, with either some unimportant informa-
tion missing or flawed grammar; (C) Acceptable:
broken, but understandable with effort; (D) Non-
sense: important information has been translated in-
correctly. This evaluation standard was introduced
by Sumita et al (1999) to evaluate S2SMT systems.
In advance, each top MT output was evaluated by
nine native speakers of the target language, who
were also familiar with the source language, and
then assigned the median grade of the nine grades.
To conduct a fair comparison, the number of MT
outputs in the system?s N-best list and the number
of MT outputs in the mixture are expected to be
the same. Thus, the authors used either a three-
best list from each of three MT systems or a five-
best list from each of two non-SMT MT systems
for the proposed RSCM and a ten-best list for the
existing RSCM. Naturally, this setting4 is not disad-
vantageous for the existing RSCM.
4In the future, we will conduct a large-scale experiment to
investigate how both RSCMs work while increasing the size of
the system?s N-best list and the mixture of M-best lists.

4.1 Evaluation metrics
The performances of both RSCMs were evaluated
by using three different metrics: ROC Curve, H-
mean, and Accuracy. For each MT system, these
metrics were separately calculated by using a con-
fusion matrix (Table 1). For example, for J2E
D3 (Section 4.2.1), the proposed RSCM checked
each top MT output from J2E D3 by using the input
mixture of three-best lists from the three J2E MT
systems (Section 4.2.1); on the other hand, the ex-
isting RSCM checked each top MT output from J2E
D3 by using the input ten-best list from J2E D3. For
J2E D3, the results were counted up into the con-
fusion matrix of each RSCM, and the metrics were
calculated as follows:
ROC Curve plots the correct acceptance rate ver-
sus the correct rejection rate for different values of
the threshold. Correct acceptance rate (CAR) is
defined as the number of satisfactory outputs that
have been accepted, divided by the total number of
satisfactory outputs, that is, Vs,a/Vs (Table 1). Cor-
rect rejection rate (CRR) is defined as the number
of unsatisfactory outputs that have been rejected, di-
vided by the total number of unsatisfactory outputs,
that is, Vu,r/Vu (Table 1).
H-mean is defined as a harmonic mean5 of
the CAR and the CRR (Table 1), 2 ? CAR ?
CRR/(CAR + CRR).
Accuracy is defined as a weighted mean6 of the
CAR and the CRR (Table 1), (Vs ? CAR + Vu ?
CRR)/(Vs + Vu) = (Vs,a + Vu,r)/(Vs + Vu).
For each performance of H-mean and Accuracy,
10-fold cross validation was conducted. The thresh-
old was fixed such that the performance was maxi-
mized on each non-held-out subset, and the perfor-
mance was calculated on the corresponding held-out
subset. To statistically test the differences in per-
formance (H-mean or Accuracy) between the confi-
dence measures, the authors conducted a pairwise t-
test (Mitchell, 1997), which was based on the results
of 10-fold cross validation. When the difference in
performance meets the following condition, the dif-
ference is statistically different at a confidence level
5This harmonic mean is used for summarizing two mea-
sures, each of which has a trade-off relationship with each
other. For example, F-measure is the harmonic mean of pre-
cision and recall, which is well used in the discipline of Infor-
mation Retrieval.
6This weighted mean is used for evaluating classification
tasks in the discipline of Machine Learning.

4.2 Experimental conditions
4.2.1 MT systems
Three English-to-Japanese (E2J) MT systems and
three Japanese-to-English (J2E) MT systems of the
three types described below were used. Table 2
shows the performances of these MT systems.
D3 (DP-match Driven transDucer) is an
example-based MT system using online-
generated translation patterns (Doi and Sumita,
2003).
HPAT (Hierarchical Phrase Alignment based
Translation) is a pattern-based system using au-
tomatically generated syntactic transfer (Imamura
et al, 2003).
SAT (Statistical ATR Translator) is an SMT
system using a retrieved seed translation as the
start point for decoding/translation (Watanabe et al,
2003).
4.2.2 Test set
The test set used consists of five hundred and ten
pairs of English and Japanese sentences, which

4.2.3 Training TMs and LMs
The corpora used for training TMs and LMs de-
scribed in Section 3.2 were merged corpora (Table
3). The number of trained TMs/LMs was three.
The translation models and language models were
learned by using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and
the CMU-Cambridge Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosen-
feld, 1997), respectively.
4.3 Experimental results and discussion
4.3.1 ROC Curve
In order to plot the ROC Curve, the authors con-
ducted the same experiment as shown in Figure 1.
That is, in the case where the grade of satisfactory
translations is only grade A, each of the proposed
and existing RSCMs tried to accept grade A MT
outputs and to reject grade B, C, or D MT outputs.
Figures 5 to 7 show the ROC Curves for each of the
three J2E MT systems (D3, HPAT, and SAT).
The curves with diamond marks, cross marks,
triangle marks, and circle marks show the ROC
Curves for the existing RSCM, the proposed RSCM

of the proposed RSCM from that of the existing RSCM, and the t-value of the left-next difference, respectively. The

spond to the three types of experiments in which each RSCM tried to accept/reject the MT output assigned one of the
grades left/right of ?|?, respectively.

isting RSCM with reordering used this sorted sys-
tem?s N-best instead of the system?s original N-best.
The dotted lines indicate the contours by H-mean
from 0.7 to 0.8. The ideal ROC curve is a square
(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0); thus, the closer the curve is to a
square, the better the performance of the RSCM is.
In Figures 5 and 6, the curves of the proposed
RSCM by using the mixture of three-best lists from
the three MT systems are much closer to a square
than that of the existing RSCM; moreover, the
curves of the proposed RSCM by using the mixture
of five-best lists from the two MT systems are much
closer to a square than that of the existing RSCM.
Note that the superiority of the proposed RSCM to
the existing RSCM is maintained even in the case
where an M-best list from the SMT system was not
used. The curves of the existing RSCM with re-
ordering are closer to a square than those of the ex-
isting RSCM. Thus the performance of the proposed
RSCM on the non-SMT systems, D3 and HPAT, are
much better than that of the existing RSCM. The
difference between the performance of the proposed
and existing RSCMs is due to both resorting the MT
outputs and using a mixture of N-best lists.
In Figure 7, the curve of the proposed RSCM is a
little closer when CRR is larger than CAR; and the
curve of the existing RSCM is a little closer when
CAR is larger than CRR. Thus, the performance
of the proposed RSCM on the SMT system, SAT,
is a little better than that of the existing RSCM in
the case where CRR is regarded as important; sim-
ilarly, the performance of the proposed RSCM on
the SMT system is a little worse than that of the ex-
isting RSCM in the case where CAR is regarded as
important.
4.3.2 H-mean and Accuracy
Tables 4 and 5 show the experimental results of ten-
fold cross-validated pairwise t-tests of the perfor-
mance of H-mean and Accuracy, respectively.
On the non-SMT systems, Table 4 shows that at
every level of translation quality that the user would
permit, the H-mean of the proposed RSCM is sig-
nificantly better than that of the existing RSCM. On
the SMT MT system, Table 4 shows that at every
permitted level of translation quality, there is no sig-
nificant difference between the H-mean of the pro-
posed RSCM and that of the existing RSCM except
for two cases: ?ABC | D? for E2J- SAT and ?AB |
CD? for J2E- SAT.
Table 5 shows almost the same tendency as Table
4. As for difference, in the case where the transla-
tion quality that the user would permit is better than
D, there is no significant difference between the Ac-
curacy of the proposed RSCM and that of the exist-
ing RSCM except in the one case of ?ABC | D? for
E2J-HPAT.
As defined in Section 4.1, Accuracy is an eval-
uation metric whose value is sensitive/inclined to
the ratio of the number of satisfactory translations
and unsatisfactory translations. H-mean is an eval-
uation metric whose value is independent/natural to
this ratio. We need to use these different evaluation
metrics according to the situations encountered. For
general purposes, the natural evaluation metric, H-
mean, is better. In the case where the test set reflects
special situations encountered, Accuracy is useful.
Regardless of whether we encounter any special
situation, in most cases on a non-SMT system, the
proposed RSCM proved to be significantly better
than the existing RSCM. In most cases on an SMT
system, the proposed RSCM proved to be as good
in performance as the existing RSCM.
This paper reports a case study in which a mixture
of N-best lists from multiple MT systems boosted
the performance of the RSCM for MT outputs. The
authors believe the proposed RSCM will work well
only when each of the element MT systems comple-
ments the others, but the authors leave the question
of the best combination of complementary MT sys-
tems open for future study.
5 Conclusions
This paper addressed the problem of eliminating un-
satisfactory outputs from MT systems. It proposed
a method that eliminates unsatisfactory outputs by
using an alternative RSCM based on a mixture of
N-best lists from multiple MT systems. The au-
thors compared the proposed and existing RSCMs
in the framework of an elimination system. When
the number of MT outputs both in the N-best list for
the existing RSCM and in the mixture of N-best lists
for the proposed RSCM is almost the same number,
i.e. ten, in most cases, the proposed RSCM proved
to work better than the existing RSCM on two non-
SMT systems and to work as well as the existing
RSCM on an SMT system.
In the future, the authors will conduct the follow-
ing experiments: (1) investigating how the proposed
RSCM works when the size of the M-best lists is
increased, and (2) seeing how the proposed RSCM
influences the performance of the selection system.
