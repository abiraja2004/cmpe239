Abstract
In this paper, experiments on automatic
extraction of keywords from abstracts us-
ing a supervised machine learning algo-
rithm are discussed. The main point of this
paper is that by adding linguistic know-
ledge to the representation (such as syn-
tactic features), rather than relying only on
statistics (such as term frequency and n-
grams), a better result is obtained as mea-
sured by keywords previously assigned by
professional indexers. In more detail, ex-
tracting NP-chunks gives a better preci-
sion than n-grams, and by adding the POS
tag(s) assigned to the term as a feature, a
dramatic improvement of the results is ob-
tained, independent of the term selection
approach applied.
1 Introduction
Automatic keyword assignment is a research topic
that has received less attention than it deserves, con-
sidering keywords? potential usefulness. Keywords
may, for example, serve as a dense summary for a
document, lead to improved information retrieval, or
be the entrance to a document collection. However,
relatively few documents have keywords assigned,
and therefore finding methods to automate the as-
signment is desirable.
A related research area is that of terminology ex-
traction (see e.g., Bourigault et al (2001)), where
all terms describing a domain are to be extracted.
The aim of keyword assignment is to find a small
set of terms that describes a specific document, in-
dependently of the domain it belongs to. However,
the latter may very well benefit from the results of
the former, as appropriate keywords often are of a
terminological character.
In this work, the automatic keyword extraction is
treated as a supervised machine learning task, an ap-
proach first proposed by Turney (2000). Two im-
portant issues are how to define the potential terms,
and what features of these terms are considered dis-
criminative, i.e., how to represent the data, and con-
sequently what is given as input to the learning al-
gorithm. In this paper, experiments with three term
selection approaches are presented: n-grams; noun
phrase (NP) chunks; and terms matching any of a
set of part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences. Four dif-
ferent features are used: term frequency, collection
frequency, relative position of the first occurrence,
and the POS tag(s) assigned to the term.
2 Points of Departure
Treating the automatic keyword extraction as a su-
pervised machine learning task means that a clas-
sifier is trained by using documents with known
keywords. The trained model is subsequently ap-
plied to documents for which no keywords are as-
signed: each defined term from these documents
is classified either as a keyword or a non-keyword;
or?if a probabilistic model is used?the probabil-
ity of the defined term being a keyword is given.
Turney (2000) presents results for a comparison be-
tween an extraction model based on a genetic algo-
rithm and an implementation of bagged C4.5 deci-
sion trees for the task. The terms are all stemmed uni-
grams, bigrams, and trigrams from the documents,
after stopword removal. The features used are, for
example, the frequency of the most frequent phrase
component; the relative number of characters of the
phrase; the first relative occurrence of a phrase com-
ponent; and whether the last word is an adjective,
as judged by the unstemmed suffix. Turney reports
that the genetic algorithm outputs better keywords
than the decision trees. Part of the same training and
test material is later used by Frank et al (1999) for
evaluating their algorithm in relation to Turney?s al-
gorithm. This algorithm, which is based on naive
Bayes, uses a smaller and simpler set of features?
term frequency, collection frequency (idf), and rel-
ative position?although it performs equally well.
Frank et al also discuss the addition of a fourth fea-
ture that significantly improves the algorithm, when
trained and tested on domain-specific documents.
This feature is the number of times a term is assigned
as a keyword to other documents in the collection.
It should be noted that the performance of the
state-of-the-art keyword extraction is much lower
than for many other NLP-tasks, such as tagging and
parsing, and there is plenty of room for improve-
ments. To give an idea of this, the results obtained
by the genetic algorithm trained by Turney (2000),
and the naive Bayes approach by Frank et al (1999)
are presented. The number of terms assigned must
be explicitly limited by the user for these algorithms.
Turney and Frank et al report the precision for five
and fifteen keywords per document. Recall is not re-
ported in their studies. In Table 1 their results when
training and testing on journal articles are shown,
and the highest values for the two algorithms are pre-
sented.

(1999)**, for five and fifteen extracted terms.
There are two drawbacks in common with
the approaches proposed by Turney (2000) and
Frank et al (1999). First, the number of tokens in a
keyword is limited to three. In the data used to train
the classifiers evaluated in this paper, 9.1% of the
manually assigned keywords consist of four tokens
or more, and the longest keywords have eight tokens.
Secondly, the user must state how many keywords
to extract from each document, as both algorithms,
for each potential keyword, output the probability of
the term being a keyword. This could be solved by
manually setting a threshold value for the probabil-
ity, but this decision should preferably be made by
the extraction system.
Finding potential terms?when no machine learn-
ing is involved in the process?by means of POS
patterns is a common approach. For exam-
ple, Barker and Cornacchia (2000) discuss an al-
gorithm where the number of words and the fre-
quency of a noun phrase, as well as the fre-
quency of the head noun is used to determine
what terms are keywords. An extraction sys-
tem called LinkIT (see e.g., Evans et al (2000))
compiles the phrases having a noun as the head,
and then ranks these according to the heads? fre-
quency. Boguraev and Kennedy (1999) extract tech-
nical terms based on the noun phrase patterns sug-
gested by Justeson and Katz (1995); these terms are
then the basis for a headline-like characterisation of
a document. The final example given in this paper
is Daille et al (1994) who apply statistical filters on
the extracted noun phrases. In that study it is con-
cluded that term frequency is the best filter candi-
date of the scores investigated. When POS patterns
are used to extract potential terms, the problem lies
in how to restrict the number of terms, and only keep
the ones that are relevant.
In the case of professional indexing, the terms are
normally limited to a domain-specific thesaurus, but
not to those present only in the document to which
they are assigned. For example, Steinberger (2001)
presents work where as a first step, all lemmas after
stop word removal in a document are ranked accord-
ing to the log-likelihood ratio, thus a list of content
descriptors is obtained. These terms are then used
to assign thesaurus terms, that have been automati-
cally assigned associating lemmas during a training
phase. In this paper, however, the concern is not to
limit the terms to a set of allowed terms.
As opposed to Turney (2000) and Frank et al
(1999), who experiment with keyword extraction
from full-length texts, this work concerns keyword
extraction from abstracts. The reason for this is that
many journal papers are not available as full-length
texts, but as abstracts only, as is the case for example
on the Internet.
The starting point for this work was to examine
whether the data representation suggested by Frank
et al was adequate for constructing a keyword ex-
traction model from and for abstracts. As the results
were poor, two alternatives to extracting n-grams
as the potential terms were explored. The first ap-
proach was to extract all noun phrases in the docu-
ments as judged by an NP-chunker. The second se-
lection approach was to define a set of POS tag se-
quences, and extract all words or sequences of words
that matched any of these, relying on a PoS tag-
ger. These two different approaches mean that the
length of the potential terms is not limited to some-
thing arbitrary, but reflects a linguistic property. The
solution to limiting the number of terms?as the
majority of the extracted words or phrases are not
keywords?was to apply a machine learning algo-
rithm to decide which terms are keywords and which
are not. The output from the machine learning algo-
rithm is binary (a term is either a keyword or not),
consequently the system itself limits the amount of
extracted keywords per document. As for the fea-
tures, a fourth feature was added to the ones used
by Frank et al, namely the POS tag(s) assigned to
the term. This feature turned out to dramatically im-
prove the results.
3 The Corpus
The collection used for the experiments described
in this paper consists of 2 000 abstracts in En-
glish, with their corresponding title and keywords
from the Inspec database. The abstracts are from
the years 1998 to 2002, from journal papers, and
from the disciplines Computers and Control, and In-
formation Technology. Each abstract has two sets
of keywords?assigned by a professional indexer?
associated to them: a set of controlled terms, i.e.,
terms restricted to the Inspec thesaurus; and a set
of uncontrolled terms that can be any suitable terms.
Both the controlled terms and the uncontrolled terms
may or may not be present in the abstracts. However,
the indexers had access to the full-length documents
when assigning the keywords. For the experiments
described here, only the uncontrolled terms were
considered, as these to a larger extent are present in
the abstracts (76.2% as opposed to 18.1%).
The set of abstracts was arbitrarily divided into
three sets: a training set (to construct the model)
consisting of 1 000 documents, a validation set (to
evaluate the models, and select the best perform-
ing one) consisting of 500 documents, and a test
set (to get unbiased results) with the remaining 500
abstracts. The set of manually assigned keywords
were then removed from the documents. For all ex-
periments the same training, validation, and test sets
were used.
4 Building the Classifiers
This section begins with a discussion on the differ-
ent ways the data were represented: in Section 4.1
the term selection approaches are described, and in
Section 4.2 the features are discussed. Thereafter, a
brief description of the machine learning approach
is given. Finally in Section 4.4, the training and the
evaluation of the classifiers are discussed.
4.1 Three Term Selection Approaches
In this section, the three different term selection ap-
proaches, in other words, the three definitions of
what constitutes a term in a document, are described.
n-grams
In a first set of runs, the terms were de-
fined in a manner similar to Turney (2000) and
Frank et al (1999). (Their studies were introduced
in Section 2.) All unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
were extracted. Thereafter a stoplist was used (from
Fox (1992)), where all terms beginning or ending
with a stopword were removed. Finally all remain-
ing tokens were stemmed using Porter?s stemmer
(Porter, 1980). In this paper, this manner of selecting
terms is referred to as the n-gram approach.
The implementation differs from Frank et al
(1999) in the following aspects:
  Only non-alphanumeric characters that were
not present in any keyword in the training set
were removed (keeping e.g., C++).
  Numbers were removed only if they stood sep-
arately (keeping e.g., 4YourSoul.com).
  Proper nouns were kept.
  The stemming and the stoplist applied were dif-
ferent.
  The stems were kept even if they appeared only
once (which is true for 80.0% of the keywords
present in the training set).
NP-chunks
That nouns are appropriate as content descrip-
tors seems to be something that most agree upon.
When inspecting manually assigned keywords, the
vast majority turn out to be nouns or noun phrases
with adjectives, and as discussed in Section 2, the re-
search on term extraction focuses on noun patterns.
To not let the selection of potential terms be an ar-
bitrary process?which is the case when extracting
n-grams?and better capture the idea of keywords
having a certain linguistic property, I decided to ex-
periment with noun phrases.
In the next set of experiments a partial parser1 was
used to select all NP-chunks from the documents.
Experiments with both unstemmed and stemmed
terms were performed. This way of defining the
terms is in this paper called the chunking approach.
POS Tag Patterns
As about half of the manual keywords present in
the training data were lost using the chunking ap-
proach, I decided to define another term selection
approach. This still captures the idea of keywords
having a certain syntactic property, but is based on
empirical evidence in the training data.
A set of POS tag patterns?in total 56?were de-
fined, and all (part-of-speech tagged) words or se-
quences of words that matched any of these were
extracted. The patterns were those tag sequences
of the manually assigned keywords, present in the
training data, that occurred ten or more times. This
way of defining the terms is here called the pattern
approach. As with the chunking approach, exper-
iments with both unstemmed and stemmed terms
were performed.
Out of the 56 patterns, 51 contain one or more
noun tags. To give an idea of the patterns, the

phen).
five most frequently occurring ones of the keywords
present in the training data are
  ADJECTIVE NOUN (singular or mass)
  NOUN NOUN (both sing. or mass)
  ADJECTIVE NOUN (plural)
  NOUN (sing. or mass) NOUN (pl.)
  NOUN (sing. or mass)
4.2 Four Features
Initially, the same features that Frank et al (1999)
used for their domain-independent experiments
were used. These were
  Within-document frequency
  Collection frequency
  Relative position of the first occurrence (the
proportion of the document preceding the first
occurrence).
The representation differed in that the term fre-
quency and the collection frequency were not
weighted together, but kept as two distinct features.
In addition, the real values were not discretised, only
rounded off to two decimals, thus more decision-
making was handed over to the algorithm. The col-
lection frequency was calculated for the three data
sets separately.
In addition, experiments with a fourth feature
were performed. This is the POS tag or tags as-
signed to the term by the same partial parser used
for finding the chunks and the tag patterns. When a
term consists of several tokens, the tags are treated
like a sequence. As an example, an extracted phrase
like random JJ excitations NNS gets the atomic fea-
ture value JJ NNS. In case a term occurs more than
once in the document, the tag or tag sequence as-
signed is the most frequently occurring one for that
term in the entire document. In case of a draw, the
first occurring one is assigned.
4.3 Rule Induction
As usual in machine learning, the input to the learn-
ing algorithm consists of examples, where an exam-
ple refers to the feature value vector for each, in
this case, potential keyword. An example that is a
manual keyword is assigned the class positive, and
those that are not are given the class negative. The
machine learning approach used for the experiments
is that of rule induction, i.e., the model that is con-
structed from the given examples, consists of a set of
rules2. The strategy used to construct the rules is re-
cursive partitioning (or divide-and-conquer), which
has as the goal to maximise the separation between
the classes for each rule.
The system used allows for different ensemble
techniques to be applied, meaning that a number of
classifiers are generated and then combined to pre-
dict the class. The one used for these experiments
is bagging (Breiman, 1996). In bagging, examples
from the training data are drawn randomly with re-
placement until a set of the original size is obtained.
This new set is then used to train a classifier. This
procedure is repeated n times to generate n classi-
fiers that then vote to classify an instance.
It should be noted that my intention is not to ar-
gue for this machine learning approach in favour of
any other. However, one advantage with rules is that
they may be inspected, and thus might give an in-
sight into how the learning component makes its de-
cisions, although this is less applicable when apply-
ing ensemble techniques.
4.4 The Training and the Evaluation
The feature values were calculated for each ex-
tracted unit in the training and the validation sets,
that is for the n-grams, NP-chunks, stemmed NP-
chunks, patterns, and the stemmed patterns respec-
tively. In other words, the within-document fre-
quency, the collection frequency, and the proportion
of the document preceding the first appearance for
each potential term were calculated. Also, the POS
tag(s) for each term were extracted. In addition,
as the machine learning approach is supervised, the
class was added, i.e., whether the term is a manually
assigned keyword or not. For the stemmed terms,
a unit was considered a keyword if it was equal to
a stemmed manual keyword. For the unstemmed
terms, the term had to match exactly.
The measure used to evaluate the results on the
validation set was the F-score, defined as

combining the precision and the recall obtained. In
this study, the main concern is the precision and the
recall for the examples that have been assigned the
class positive, that is how many of the suggested
keywords are correct (precision), and how many of
the manually assigned keywords that are found (re-
call). As the proportion of correctly suggested key-
words is considered equally important as the amount
of terms assigned by a professional indexer that was
detected,  was assigned the value 1, thus giving
precision and recall equal weights.
When calculating the recall, the value for the to-
tal number of manually assigned keywords present
in the documents is used, independent of the num-
ber actually present in the different representations.
This figure varies slightly for the unstemmed and
the stemmed data, and for the two the correspond-
ing value is used.
Several runs were made for each representation,
with the goal to maximise the performance as eval-
uated on the validation set: first the weights of the
positive examples were adjusted, as the data set is
unbalanced. A better performance was obtained
when the positive examples in the training data out-
numbered the negative ones. Thereafter experiments
with bagging were performed, and also, runs with
and without the POS tag feature were made. The
results are presented next.
5 The Results
In this section, the results obtained by the best per-
forming model for each approach?as judged on the
validation set?when run on the previously unseen
test set are presented. It should, however, be noted
that the number of possible runs is very large, by
varying for example the number of classifiers gen-
erated by the ensemble technique. It might well be
that better results are possible for any of the repre-
sentations.
As stemming with few exceptions led to better re-
sults on the validation set over all runs, only these
values are presented in this section. In Table 2, the
number of assigned terms and the number of cor-
rect terms, in total and on average per document are
shown. Also, precision, recall, and the F-score are
presented. For each approach, both the results with
and without the POS tag feature are given.
The length of the abstracts in the test set varies
from 338 to 23 tokens (the median is 121 tokens).
The number of uncontrolled terms per document is
31 to 2 (the median is 9 keywords). The total number
of stemmed keywords present in the stemmed test
set is 3 816, and the average number of terms is 7.63.
Their distribution over the 500 documents is 27 to
three documents with 0 terms, with the median being
7.
As for bagging, it was noted that although the
accuracy (i.e., the number of correctly classified
positive and negative examples divided by the total
number of examples) improved when increasing the
number of classifiers, the F-score often decreased.
For the pattern approach without the tag features the
best model consists of a 5-bagged classifier, for the
pattern approach with the tag feature a 20-bagged,
and finally for the n-gram approach with the tag fea-
ture a 10-bagged classifier. For the other three runs
a single classifier had the best performance.
5.1 Results of the n-gram Approach
When extracting the terms from the test set accord-
ing to the n-gram approach, the data consisted of
42 159 negative examples, and 3 330 positive exam-
ples, thus in total 45 489 examples were classified by
the trained model. Using this manner of extracting
the terms meant that 12.8% of the keywords origi-
nally present in the test set were lost.
To summarise the n-gram approach (see Table 2),
without the tag feature it finds on average 4.37
keywords per document, out of originally on aver-
age 7.63 manual keywords present in the abstracts.
However, the price paid for these correct terms
is high: almost 38 incorrect terms per document.
When adding the fourth feature, the number of cor-
rect terms decreases slightly, while the number of
incorrect terms is decreased to a third. If looking
at the actual distribution of assigned terms for these
two runs, this varies between 134(!) and 5 without
the tag feature, and from 48 to 1 with the tag feature.
The median is 40 and 14 respectively.
The F-scores (F     ) for these two runs are 17.6
and 33.9 respectively. 33.9 is the highest F-score
that was achieved for the six runs presented here.
5.2 Results of the Chunking Approach
When extracting the terms according to the stemmed
chunking approach, the test set consisted of 13 579
negative, and 1 920 positive examples; in total
15 499 examples.
An F-score (F     ) of 22.7 is obtained without the
POS tag feature, and 33.0 with this feature. The
number of terms on average per document is 16.38
without the tag feature, and 9.58 with it. If looking
at each document, the number of keywords assigned
varies from 46 to 0 (for three documents) with the
median 16, and 29 to 0 (for four documents) with
the median value being 9 terms.
Extracting the terms with the chunking approach
meant that slightly more than half of the keywords
actually present in the test set were lost, and com-
pared to the n-gram approach the number of cor-
rect terms assigned was almost halved. The number
of incorrect keywords, however, decreased consider-
ably. But, the difference is shown when the POS tag
feature is included: the number of correctly assigned
terms is more or less the same for this approach with
or without the tag feature, while the number of in-
correct terms is halved.
5.3 Results of the Pattern Approach
When extracting the terms according to the stemmed
pattern approach, the test data consisted of 33 507
examples. Of these were 3 340 positive, and 30 167
negative. In total, 12.5% of the present keywords
were lost.
The F-scores (F     ) for the two runs, displayed in
Table 2, are 25.6 (without the tag feature) and 28.1
(with the tag feature). The number of terms assigned
on average per document is 5.04 and 3.05 without
and with the tag feature respectively. The actual
number of terms assigned per document is 100 to
0 (for three documents) without the tag feature, and
46 to 0 (for four documents) with the tag feature.
The median is 30 and 12 respectively.
6 Concluding Remarks and Future Work
In this paper I have shown how keyword extrac-
tion from abstracts can be achieved by using simple
statistical measures as well as syntactic information
from the documents, as input to a machine learn-
ing algorithm. If first considering the term selec-

tion approaches, extracting NP-chunks gives a better
precision, while extracting all words or sequences
of words matching any of a set of POS tag pat-
terns gives a higher recall compared to extracting n-
grams. The highest F-score is obtained by one of
the n-gram runs. The largest amount of assigned
terms present in the abstracts are assigned by the
pattern approach without the tag feature. The pat-
tern approach is also the approach which keeps the
largest number of assigned terms after that the data
have been pre-processed. Using phrases means that
the length of the potential terms is not restricted to
something arbitrary, rather the terms are treat as the
units they are. However, of the patterns that were se-
lected for the experiments discussed here none was
longer than four tokens. If looking at all assigned
keywords in the training set, 3.0% are then ruled out
as potential terms. The longest chunks in the test set
that were correctly assigned are five tokens long. As
for when syntactic information is included as a fea-
ture (in the form of the POS tag(s) assigned to the
term), it is evident from the results presented in this
paper that this information is crucial for assigning an
acceptable number of terms per document, indepen-
dent of what term selection strategy is chosen.
One shortcoming of the work is that there is cur-
rently no relation between the different POS tag fea-
ture values. For example, a singular noun has no
closer relationship to a plural noun than to an adjec-
tive. In the future, the patterns should somehow be
categorised reflecting their semantics, perhaps in a
hierarchical manner, or morphological information
could be removed.
In this paper I have not touched upon the more in-
tricate aspects of evaluation, but simply treated the
manually assigned keywords as the gold standard.
This is the most severe way to evaluate a keyword
extractor, as many terms might be just as good, al-
though for one reason or another not chosen by the
human indexer. Future work will examine alterna-
tive approaches to evaluation. One possibility for
a more liberal evaluation could be to use human
evaluators with real information needs, as done by
Turney (2000). Another possibility would be to let
several persons index each document, thus getting a
larger set of acceptable terms to choose from. This
would hopefully lead to a better precision, while re-
call probably would be affected negatively; the im-
portance of recall would then need to be reconsid-
ered.
Future work should also go in the direction of
generating (as opposed to extracting) keywords, by
for example exploring potential knowledge provided
by a thesaurus.
