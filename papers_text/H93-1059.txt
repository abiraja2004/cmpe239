Work in natural language processing has been moving rapidly 
towards the creation of large-scale systems addressed to real 
tasks. One aspect of this has been a rapid increase in the 
vocabulary size of these systems. "Toy" lexicons of 500 or 
1000 words are no longer adequate; several tens of thousands 
lexical entries will be required, at a minimum. Developers 
of machine translation systems - -  who have confronted the 
problems of "real," largely unrestricted, text much longer 
than most other natural anguage researchers - - have long 
recognized the central role of large, high quality lexicons. 
Such broad-coverage lexical resources are of course costly 
and time-consuming to develop. Fortunately, however, there 
seems a reasonable prospect hat they can be developed as 
shared resources. Current lexicons record for the most part 
relatively shallow (simply structured) information about the 
pronunciation, syntax, and semantics of words. There appears 
to be a general agreement between different system developers 
on at least some of the features to be captured in the lexicon, 
even though these features may be represented very differently 
in the various systems. The agreement seems to be clearest 
regarding syntactic information, but there is reason to believe 
that at least a partial consensus can be reached regarding 
pronunciation and possibly for semantic information as well. 
All of the presentations in this session addressed the need for 
broad-coverage lexical resources. In addition to the papers in- 
cluded in this volume, there were presentations byProf. Mark 
Liberman of the Univ. of Pennsylvania and Prof. Makoto Na- 
gao of Kyoto Univ. 
Prof. Liberman discussed some of the plans of the Linguistic 
Data Consortium. The Linguistic Data Consortium was cre- 
ated in 1992 with a combination of government and private 
funds in order to create a rich repository of resources for re- 
search and development of natural language systems. As part 
of its mandate, the Consortium intends to assemble a range 
of lexical resources including pronunciation, syntactic, and 
semantic information, under the general heading of COM- 
LEX (a COMmon LEXicon). Among these efforts, the work 
on a syntactic lexicon - -  COMLEX Syntax - -  is furthest 
advanced; the paper by the group at New York University 
describes the status of this project. 
These works are small in scale when compared to the dic- 
tionary el~forts in Japan, which were summarized in Prof. 
Nagao's presentation. The largest of these efforts is the EDR 
Project of the Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute. 
This project is producing a collection of interrelated dictionar- 
ies, including a Japanese dictionary and an English dictionary 
(each of about 300,000 entries) whose entries are both linked 
to a "concept dictionary". 
Prof. George Miller and his associates at Princeton Univer- 
sity have for the past several years been constructing a lex- 
ical knowledge base called WordNet. In WordNet, English 
nouns, verbs, and adjectives are organized into synonym sets 
("synsets"), each representing one underlying lexical concept; 
these synsets are connected by various semantic relations, 
such as antonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy. A word may 
have several meanings and so be assigned to several synsets; 
a word with its synset can thus be used to identify a partic- 
ular sense of a word. The paper "A Semantic Concordance" 
describes an ongoing effort to "tag" a corpus by identifying, 
for each content word (noun, verb, adjective, and adverb), the 
synset o which it belongs in that context. 
Corpus tagging can be even more valuable if the same cor- 
pus is tagged for several different lexical characteristics. For 
example, the COMLEX Syntax group is considering the pos- 
sibility of tagging the verbs in a corpus according to the 
subcategorization frame used in each context. Although the 
COMLEX Syntax Lexicon will initially not be sense distin- 
guished, correlating the subcategorization tags with WordNet 
sense tags would give some indication of the correspondence 
between subcategorizations a d word senses. 
Identifying the general vocabulary - -  nouns, verbs, adjec- 
tives .... - -  is only part of the battle in lexical analysis. Many 
texts are replete with proper nouns (names). Although we can 
include the most frequent of these in our lexicon, the list can 
never be complete. A good lexicon must herefore be comple- 
mented by effective strategies for identifying and classifying 
proper nouns, which typically involve some combination of 
pattern matching with information from the lexicon. The final 
paper in this session, from Syracuse University, describes an 
approach to proper noun identification and and evaluation of 
this approach on a sample from the Tipster corpus.
