Abstract
Subjectivity and meaning are both impor-
tant properties of language. This paper ex-
plores their interaction, and brings empir-
ical evidence in support of the hypotheses
that (1) subjectivity is a property that can
be associated with word senses, and (2)
word sense disambiguation can directly
benefit from subjectivity annotations.
1 Introduction
There is growing interest in the automatic extrac-
tion of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text
(subjectivity), to provide tools and support for var-
ious NLP applications. Similarly, there is continu-
ous interest in the task of word sense disambigua-
tion, with sense-annotated resources being devel-
oped for many languages, and a growing num-
ber of research groups participating in large-scale
evaluations such as SENSEVAL.
Though both of these areas are concerned with
the semantics of a text, over time there has been
little interaction, if any, between them. In this pa-
per, we address this gap, and explore possible in-
teractions between subjectivity and word sense.
There are several benefits that would motivate
such a joint exploration. First, at the resource
level, the augmentation of lexical resources such
as WordNet (Miller, 1995) with subjectivity labels
could support better subjectivity analysis tools,
and principled methods for refining word senses
and clustering similar meanings. Second, at the
tool level, an explicit link between subjectivity and
word sense could help improve methods for each,
by integrating features learned from one into the
other in a pipeline approach, or through joint si-
multaneous learning.
In this paper we address two questions about
word sense and subjectivity. First, can subjectiv-
ity labels be assigned to word senses? To address
this question, we perform two studies. The first
(Section 3) investigates agreement between anno-
tators who manually assign the labels subjective,
objective, or both to WordNet senses. The second
study (Section 4) evaluates a method for automatic
assignment of subjectivity labels to word senses.
We devise an algorithm relying on distributionally
similar words to calculate a subjectivity score, and
show how it can be used to automatically assess
the subjectivity of a word sense.
Second, can automatic subjectivity analysis be
used to improve word sense disambiguation? To
address this question, the output of a subjectivity
sentence classifier is input to a word-sense disam-
biguation system, which is in turn evaluated on the
nouns from the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sam-
ple task (Section 5). The results of this experiment
show that a subjectivity feature can significantly
improve the accuracy of a word sense disambigua-
tion system for those words that have both subjec-
tive and objective senses.
A third obvious question is, can word sense dis-
ambiguation help automatic subjectivity analysis?
However, due to space limitations, we do not ad-
dress this question here, but rather leave it for fu-
ture work.
2 Background
Subjective expressions are words and phrases
being used to express opinions, emotions, evalu-
ations, speculations, etc. (Wiebe et al, 2005). A
general covering term for such states is private
state, ?a state that is not open to objective obser-
1065
vation or verification? (Quirk et al, 1985).1 There
are three main types of subjective expressions:2
(1) references to private states:
His alarm grew.
He absorbed the information quickly.
He was boiling with anger.
(2) references to speech (or writing) events ex-
pressing private states:
UCC/Disciples leaders roundly con-
demned the Iranian President?s verbal
assault on Israel.
The editors of the left-leaning paper at-
tacked the new House Speaker.
(3) expressive subjective elements:
He would be quite a catch.
What?s the catch?
That doctor is a quack.
Work on automatic subjectivity analysis falls
into three main areas. The first is identifying
words and phrases that are associated with sub-
jectivity, for example, that think is associated with
private states and that beautiful is associated with
positive sentiments (e.g., (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Kamps and Marx,
2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005)).
Such judgments are made for words. In contrast,
our end task (in Section 4) is to assign subjectivity
labels to word senses.
The second is subjectivity classification of sen-
tences, clauses, phrases, or word instances in the
context of a particular text or conversation, ei-
ther subjective/objective classifications or posi-
tive/negative sentiment classifications (e.g.,(Riloff
and Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003;
Dave et al, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004)).
The third exploits automatic subjectivity anal-
ysis in applications such as review classification
(e.g., (Turney, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004)), min-
ing texts for product reviews (e.g., (Yi et al, 2003;
Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005)),
summarization (e.g., (Kim and Hovy, 2004)), in-
formation extraction (e.g., (Riloff et al, 2005)),
1Note that sentiment, the focus of much recent work in the
area, is a type of subjectivity, specifically involving positive
or negative opinion, emotion, or evaluation.
2These distinctions are not strictly needed for this paper,
but may help the reader appreciate the examples given below.
and question answering (e.g., (Yu and Hatzivas-
siloglou, 2003; Stoyanov et al, 2005)).
Most manual subjectivity annotation research
has focused on annotating words, out of context
(e.g., (Heise, 2001)), or sentences and phrases in
the context of a text or conversation (e.g., (Wiebe
et al, 2005)). The new annotations in this pa-
per are instead targeting the annotation of word
senses.
3 Human Judgment of Word Sense
Subjectivity
To explore our hypothesis that subjectivity may
be associated with word senses, we developed a
manual annotation scheme for assigning subjec-
tivity labels to WordNet senses,3 and performed
an inter-annotator agreement study to assess its
reliability. Senses are classified as S(ubjective),
O(bjective), or B(oth). Classifying a sense as S
means that, when the sense is used in a text or con-
versation, we expect it to express subjectivity; we
also expect the phrase or sentence containing it to
be subjective.
We saw a number of subjective expressions in
Section 2. A subset is repeated here, along with
relevant WordNet senses. In the display of each
sense, the first part shows the synset, gloss, and
any examples. The second part (marked with =>)
shows the immediate hypernym.
His alarm grew.
alarm, dismay, consternation ? (fear resulting from the aware-
ness of danger)
=> fear, fearfulness, fright ? (an emotion experienced in
anticipation of some specific pain or danger (usually ac-
companied by a desire to flee or fight))
He was boiling with anger.
seethe, boil ? (be in an agitated emotional state; ?The cus-
tomer was seething with anger?)
=> be ? (have the quality of being; (copula, used with an
adjective or a predicate noun); ?John is rich?; ?This is not
a good answer?)
What?s the catch?
catch ? (a hidden drawback; ?it sounds good but what?s the
catch??)
=> drawback ? (the quality of being a hindrance; ?he
pointed out all the drawbacks to my plan?)
That doctor is a quack.
quack ? (an untrained person who pretends to be a physician
and who dispenses medical advice)
=> doctor, doc, physician, MD, Dr., medico
Before specifying what we mean by an objec-
tive sense, we give examples.
3All our examples and data used in the experiments are
from WordNet 2.0.
1066
The alarm went off.
alarm, warning device, alarm system ? (a device that signals
the occurrence of some undesirable event)
=> device ? (an instrumentality invented for a particu-
lar purpose; ?the device is small enough to wear on your
wrist?; ?a device intended to conserve water?)
The water boiled.
boil ? (come to the boiling point and change from a liquid to
vapor; ?Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius?)
=> change state, turn ? (undergo a transformation or a
change of position or action; ?We turned from Socialism
to Capitalism?; ?The people turned against the President
when he stole the election?)
He sold his catch at the market.
catch, haul ? (the quantity that was caught; ?the catch was
only 10 fish?)
=> indefinite quantity ? (an estimated quantity)
The duck?s quack was loud and brief.
quack ? (the harsh sound of a duck)
=> sound ? (the sudden occurrence of an audible event;
?the sound awakened them?)
While we expect phrases or sentences contain-
ing subjective senses to be subjective, we do not
necessarily expect phrases or sentences containing
objective senses to be objective. Consider the fol-
lowing examples:
Will someone shut that damn alarm off?
Can?t you even boil water?
While these sentences contain objective senses
of alarm and boil, the sentences are subjective
nonetheless. But they are not subjective due to
alarm and boil, but rather to punctuation, sentence
forms, and other words in the sentence. Thus, clas-
sifying a sense as O means that, when the sense is
used in a text or conversation, we do not expect
it to express subjectivity and, if the phrase or sen-
tence containing it is subjective, the subjectivity is
due to something else.
Finally, classifying a sense as B means it covers
both subjective and objective usages, e.g.:
absorb, suck, imbibe, soak up, sop up, suck up, draw, take in,
take up ? (take in, also metaphorically; ?The sponge absorbs
water well?; ?She drew strength from the minister?s words?)
Manual subjectivity judgments were added to
a total of 354 senses (64 words). One annotator,
Judge 1 (a co-author), tagged all of them. A sec-
ond annotator (Judge 2, who is not a co-author)
tagged a subset for an agreement study, presented
next.
3.1 Agreement Study
For the agreement study, Judges 1 and 2 indepen-
dently annotated 32 words (138 senses). 16 words
have both S and O senses and 16 do not (according
to Judge 1). Among the 16 that do not have both
S and O senses, 8 have only S senses and 8 have
only O senses. All of the subsets are balanced be-
tween nouns and verbs. Table 1 shows the contin-
gency table for the two annotators? judgments on
this data. In addition to S, O, and B, the annotation
scheme also permits U(ncertain) tags.
S O B U Total
S 39 O O 4 43
O 3 73 2 4 82
B 1 O 3 1 5
U 3 2 O 3 8
Total 46 75 5 12 138
Table 1: Agreement on balanced set (Agreement:
85.5%, ?: 0.74)
Overall agreement is 85.5%, with a Kappa (?)
value of 0.74. For 12.3% of the senses, at least
one annotator?s tag is U. If we consider these cases
to be borderline and exclude them from the study,
percent agreement increases to 95% and ? rises to
0.90. Thus, annotator agreement is especially high
when both are certain.
Considering only the 16-word subset with both
S and O senses (according to Judge 1), ? is .75,
and for the 16-word subset for which Judge 1 gave
only S or only O senses, ? is .73. Thus, the two
subsets are of comparable difficulty.
The two annotators also independently anno-
tated the 20 ambiguous nouns (117 senses) of the
SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task used in
Section 5. For this tagging task, U tags were not
allowed, to create a definitive gold standard for the
experiments. Even so, the ? value for them is 0.71,
which is not substantially lower. The distributions
of Judge 1?s tags for all 20 words can be found in
Table 3 below.
We conclude this section with examples of
disagreements that illustrate sources of uncer-
tainty. First, uncertainty arises when subjec-
tive senses are missing from the dictionary.
The labels for the senses of noun assault are
(O:O,O:O,O:O,O:UO).4 For verb assault there is
a subjective sense:
attack, round, assail, lash out, snipe, assault (attack in speech
or writing) ?The editors of the left-leaning paper attacked the
new House Speaker?
However, there is no corresponding sense for
4I.e., the first three were labeled O by both annotators. For
the fourth sense, the second annotator was not sure but was
leaning toward O.
1067
noun assault. A missing sense may lead an anno-
tator to try to see subjectivity in an objective sense.
Second, uncertainty can arise in weighing hy-
pernym against sense. It is fine for a synset to
imply just S or O, while the hypernym implies
both (the synset specializes the more general con-
cept). However, consider the following, which
was tagged (O:UB).
attack ? (a sudden occurrence of an uncontrollable condition;
?an attack of diarrhea?)
=> affliction ? (a cause of great suffering and distress)
While the sense is only about the condition, the
hypernym highlights subjective reactions to the
condition. One annotator judged only the sense
(giving tag O), while the second considered the
hypernym as well (giving tag UB).
4 Automatic Assessment of Word Sense
Subjectivity
Encouraged by the results of the agreement study,
we devised a method targeting the automatic an-
notation of word senses for subjectivity.
The main idea behind our method is that we can
derive information about a word sense based on in-
formation drawn from words that are distribution-
ally similar to the given word sense. This idea re-
lates to the unsupervised word sense ranking algo-
rithm described in (McCarthy et al, 2004). Note,
however, that (McCarthy et al, 2004) used the in-
formation about distributionally similar words to
approximate corpus frequencies for word senses,
whereas we target the estimation of a property of
a given word sense (the ?subjectivity?).
Starting with a given ambiguous word w, we
first find the distributionally similar words using
the method of (Lin, 1998) applied to the automat-
ically parsed texts of the British National Corpus.
Let DSW = dsw1, dsw2, ..., dswn be the list of
top-ranked distributionally similar words, sorted
in decreasing order of their similarity.
Next, for each sense wsi of the word w, we de-
termine the similarity with each of the words in the
list DSW , using a WordNet-based measure of se-
mantic similarity (wnss). Although a large num-
ber of such word-to-word similarity measures ex-
ist, we chose to use the (Jiang and Conrath, 1997)
measure, since it was found both to be efficient
and to provide the best results in previous exper-
iments involving word sense ranking (McCarthy
et al, 2004)5. For distributionally similar words
5Note that unlike the above measure of distributional sim-

then

10: end if
11: totalsim += sim(wi,dswj)
12: end for
13: end for
14: subj(wi) = subj(wi) / totalsim
that are themselves ambiguous, we use the sense
that maximizes the similarity score. The similar-
ity scores associated with each word dswj are nor-
malized so that they add up to one across all possi-
ble senses of w, which results in a score described
by the following formula:
sim(wsi, dswj) = wnss(wsi,dswj)?
i??senses(w)
wnss(wsi? ,dswj)
where
wnss(wsi, dswj) = max
k?senses(dswj)
wnss(wsi, dswkj )
A selection process can also be applied so that
a distributionally similar word belongs only to
one sense. In this case, for a given sense wi we
use only those distributionally similar words with
whom wi has the highest similarity score across all
the senses of w. We refer to this case as similarity-
selected, as opposed to similarity-all, which refers
to the use of all distributionally similar words for
all senses.
Once we have a list of similar words associated
with each sense wsi and the corresponding simi-
larity scores sim(wsi, dswj), we use an annotated
corpus to assign subjectivity scores to the senses.
The corpus we use is the MPQA Opinion Corpus,
which consists of over 10,000 sentences from the
world press annotated for subjective expressions
(all three types of subjective expressions described
in Section 2).6
ilarity which measures similarity between words, rather than
word senses, here we needed a similarity measure that also
takes into account word senses as defined in a sense inven-
tory such as WordNet.
6The MPQA corpus is described in (Wiebe et al, 2005)
and available at www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/databaserelease/.
1068
Algorithm 1 is our method for calculating sense
subjectivity scores. The subjectivity score is a
value in the interval [-1,+1] with +1 correspond-
ing to highly subjective and -1 corresponding to
highly objective. It is a sum of sim scores, where
sim(wi,dswj) is added for each instance of dswj
that is in a subjective expression, and subtracted
for each instance that is not in a subjective expres-
sion.
Note that the annotations in the MPQA corpus
are for subjective expressions in context. Thus, the
data is somewhat noisy for our task, because, as
discussed in Section 3, objective senses may ap-
pear in subjective expressions. Nonetheless, we
hypothesized that subjective senses tend to appear
more often in subjective expressions than objec-
tive senses do, and use the appearance of words in
subjective expressions as evidence of sense sub-
jectivity.
(Wiebe, 2000) also makes use of an annotated
corpus, but in a different approach: given a word
w and a set of distributionally similar words DSW,
that method assigns a subjectivity score to w equal
to the conditional probability that any member of
DSW is in a subjective expression. Moreover, the
end task of that work was to annotate words, while
our end task is the more difficult problem of anno-
tating word senses for subjectivity.
4.1 Evaluation
The evaluation of the algorithm is performed
against the gold standard of 64 words (354 word
senses) using Judge 1?s annotations, as described
in Section 3.
For each sense of each word in the set of 64
ambiguous words, we use Algorithm 1 to deter-
mine a subjectivity score. A subjectivity label is
then assigned depending on the value of this score
with respect to a pre-selected threshold. While a
threshold of 0 seems like a sensible choice, we per-
form the evaluation for different thresholds rang-
ing across the [-1,+1] interval, and correspond-
ingly determine the precision of the algorithm at
different points of recall7. Note that the word
senses for which none of the distributionally sim-
ilar words are found in the MPQA corpus are not
7Specifically, in the list of word senses ranked by their
subjectivity score, we assign a subjectivity label to the top N
word senses. The precision is then determined as the number
of correct subjectivity label assignments out of all N assign-
ments, while the recall is measured as the correct subjective
senses out of all the subjective senses in the gold standard
data set. By varying the value of N from 1 to the total num-
ber of senses in the corpus, we can derive precision and recall
curves.
included in this evaluation (excluding 82 senses),
since in this case a subjectivity score cannot be
calculated. The evaluation is therefore performed
on a total of 272 word senses.
As a baseline, we use an ?informed? random as-
signment of subjectivity labels, which randomly
assigns S labels to word senses in the data set,
such that the maximum number of S assignments
equals the number of correct S labels in the gold
standard data set. This baseline guarantees a max-
imum recall of 1 (which under true random condi-
tions might not be achievable). Correspondingly,
given the controlled distribution of S labels across
the data set in the baseline setting, the precision
is equal for all eleven recall points, and is deter-
mined as the total number of correct subjective as-
signments divided by the size of the data set8.
Number Break-even
Algorithm of DSW point
similarity-all 100 0.41
similarity-selected 100 0.50
similarity-all 160 0.43
similarity-selected 160 0.50
baseline - 0.27
Table 2: Break-even point for different algorithm
and parameter settings
There are two aspects of the sense subjectivity
scoring algorithm that can influence the label as-
signment, and correspondingly their evaluation.
First, as indicated above, after calculating the
semantic similarity of the distributionally similar
words with each sense, we can either use all the
distributionally similar words for the calculation
of the subjectivity score of each sense (similarity-
all), or we can use only those that lead to the high-
est similarity (similarity-selected). Interestingly,
this aspect can drastically affect the algorithm ac-
curacy. The setting where a distributionally simi-
lar word can belong only to one sense significantly
improves the algorithm performance. Figure 1
plots the interpolated precision for eleven points of
recall, for similarity-all, similarity-selected, and
baseline. As shown in this figure, the precision-
recall curves for our algorithm are clearly above
the ?informed? baseline, indicating the ability of
our algorithm to automatically identify subjective
word senses.
Second, the number of distributionally similar
words considered in the first stage of the algo-
rithm can vary, and might therefore influence the
8In other words, this fraction represents the probability of
making the correct subjective label assignment by chance.

output of the algorithm. We experiment with two
different values, namely 100 and 160 top-ranked
distributionally similar words. Table 2 shows the
break-even points for the four different settings
that were evaluated,9 with results that are almost
double compared to the informed baseline. As
it turns out, for weaker versions of the algorithm
(i.e., similarity-all), the size of the set of distribu-
tionally similar words can significantly impact the
performance of the algorithm. However, for the al-
ready improved similarity-selected algorithm ver-
sion, this parameter does not seem to have influ-
ence, as similar results are obtained regardless of
the number of distributionally similar words. This
is in agreement with the finding of (McCarthy et
al., 2004) that, in their word sense ranking method,
a larger set of neighbors did not influence the al-
gorithm accuracy.
5 Automatic Subjectivity Annotations for
Word Sense Disambiguation
The final question we address is concerned with
the potential impact of subjectivity on the quality
of a word sense classifier. To answer this ques-
tion, we augment an existing data-driven word
sense disambiguation system with a feature re-
flecting the subjectivity of the examples where the
ambiguous word occurs, and evaluate the perfor-
mance of the new subjectivity-aware classifier as
compared to the traditional context-based sense
classifier.
We use a word sense disambiguation system
that integrates both local and topical features.
9The break-even point (Lewis, 1992) is a standard mea-
sure used in conjunction with precision-recall evaluations. It
represents the value where precision and recall become equal.
Specifically, we use the current word and its part-
of-speech, a local context of three words to the
left and right of the ambiguous word, the parts-of-
speech of the surrounding words, and a global con-
text implemented through sense-specific keywords
determined as a list of at most five words occurring
at least three times in the contexts defining a cer-
tain word sense. This feature set is similar to the
one used by (Ng and Lee, 1996), as well as by a
number of SENSEVAL systems. The parameters
for sense-specific keyword selection were deter-
mined through cross-fold validation on the train-
ing set. The features are integrated in a Naive
Bayes classifier, which was selected mainly for
its performance in previous work showing that it
can lead to a state-of-the-art disambiguation sys-
tem given the features we consider (Lee and Ng,
2002).
The experiments are performed on the set of
ambiguous nouns from the SENSEVAL-3 English
lexical sample evaluation (Mihalcea et al, 2004).
We use the rule-based subjective sentence classi-
fier of (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) to assign an S,
O, or B label to all the training and test examples
pertaining to these ambiguous words. This sub-
jectivity annotation tool targets sentences, rather
than words or paragraphs, and therefore the tool is
fed with sentences. We also include a surrounding
context of two additional sentences, because the
classifier considers some contextual information.
Our hypothesis motivating the use of a
sentence-level subjectivity classifier is that in-
stances of subjective senses are more likely to be
in subjective sentences, and thus that sentence sub-
jectivity is an informative feature for the disam-
biguation of words having both subjective and ob-
jective senses.
For each ambiguous word, we perform two sep-
arate runs: one using the basic disambiguation
system described earlier, and another using the
subjectivity-aware system that includes the addi-
tional subjectivity feature. Table 3 shows the re-
sults obtained for these 20 nouns, including word
sense disambiguation accuracy for the two differ-
ent systems, the most frequent sense baseline, and
the subjectivity/objectivity split among the word
senses (according to Judge 1). The words in the
top half of the table are the ones that have both S
and O senses, and those in the bottom are the ones
that do not. If we were to use Judge 2?s tags in-
stead of Judge 1?s, only one word would change:
source would move from the top to the bottom of
the table.

Table 3: Word Sense Disambiguation with and
without subjectivity information, for the set of am-
biguous nouns in SENSEVAL-3
For the words that have both S and O senses,
the addition of the subjectivity feature alone can
bring a significant error rate reduction of 4.3%
(p < 0.05 paired t-test). Interestingly, no improve-
ments are observed for the words with no subjec-
tive senses; on the contrary, the addition of the
subjectivity feature results in a small degradation.
Overall for the entire set of ambiguous words, the
error reduction is measured at 2.2% (significant at
p < 0.1 paired t-test).
In almost all cases, the words with both S and O
senses show improvement, while the others show
small degradation or no change. This suggests that
if a subjectivity label is available for the words in
a lexical resource (e.g. using Algorithm 1 from
Section 4), such information can be used to decide
on using a subjectivity-aware system, thereby im-
proving disambiguation accuracy.
One of the exceptions is disc, which had a small
benefit, despite not having any subjective senses.
As it happens, the first sense of disc is phonograph
record.
phonograph record, phonograph recording, record, disk, disc,
platter ? (sound recording consisting of a disc with continu-
ous grooves; formerly used to reproduce music by rotating
while a phonograph needle tracked in the grooves)
The improvement can be explained by observ-
ing that many of the training and test sentences
containing this sense are labeled subjective by the
classifier, and indeed this sense frequently occurs
in subjective sentences such as ?This is anyway a
stunning disc.?
Another exception is the noun plan, which did
not benefit from the subjectivity feature, although
it does have a subjective sense. This can perhaps
be explained by the data set for this word, which
seems to be particularly difficult, as the basic clas-
sifier itself could not improve over the most fre-
quent sense baseline.
The other word that did not benefit from the
subjectivity feature is the noun source, for which
its only subjective sense did not appear in the
sense-annotated data, leading therefore to an ?ob-
jective only? set of examples.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
The questions posed in the introduction concern-
ing the possible interaction between subjectivity
and word sense found answers throughout the pa-
per. As it turns out, a correlation can indeed be
established between these two semantic properties
of language.
Addressing the first question of whether subjec-
tivity is a property that can be assigned to word
senses, we showed that good agreement (?=0.74)
can be achieved between human annotators la-
beling the subjectivity of senses. When uncer-
tain cases are removed, the ? value is even higher
(0.90). Moreover, the automatic subjectivity scor-
ing mechanism that we devised was able to suc-
cessfully assign subjectivity labels to senses, sig-
nificantly outperforming an ?informed? baseline
associated with the task. While much work re-
mains to be done, this first attempt has proved
the feasibility of correctly assigning subjectivity
labels to the fine-grained level of word senses.
The second question was also positively an-
swered: the quality of a word sense disambigua-
tion system can be improved with the addition
of subjectivity information. Section 5 provided
evidence that automatic subjectivity classification
may improve word sense disambiguation perfor-
mance, but mainly for words with both subjective
and objective senses. As we saw, performance
may even degrade for words that do not. Tying
the pieces of this paper together, once the senses
in a dictionary have been assigned subjectivity la-
bels, a word sense disambiguation system could
consult them to decide whether it should consider
or ignore the subjectivity feature.
There are several other ways our results could
impact future work. Subjectivity labels would
be a useful source of information when manually
augmenting the lexical knowledge in a dictionary,
1071
e.g., when choosing hypernyms for senses or de-
ciding which senses to eliminate when defining a
coarse-grained sense inventory (if there is a sub-
jective sense, at least one should be retained).
Adding subjectivity labels to WordNet could
also support automatic subjectivity analysis. First,
the input corpus could be sense tagged and the
subjectivity labels of the assigned senses could be
exploited by a subjectivity recognition tool. Sec-
ond, a number of methods for subjectivity or sen-
timent analysis start with a set of seed words and
then search through WordNet to find other subjec-
tive words (Kamps and Marx, 2002; Yu and Hatzi-
vassiloglou, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and
Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005). How-
ever, such searches may veer off course down ob-
jective paths. The subjectivity labels assigned to
senses could be consulted to keep the search trav-
eling along subjective paths.
Finally, there could be different strategies
for exploiting subjectivity annotations and word
sense. While the current setting considered a
pipeline approach, where the output of a subjec-
tivity annotation system was fed to the input of a
method for semantic disambiguation, future work
could also consider the role of word senses as a
possible way of improving subjectivity analysis,
or simultaneous annotations of subjectivity and
word meanings, as done in the past for other lan-
guage processing problems.
