This is a basic research project whose thrust is both theoretical nd practical in nature. 
The core technology consists of techniques using machine learning and statistical theory as 
well as fundamental linguistic and phonetic theory. The investigations aim at furthering 
the understanding of requirements for future speech recognition systems, and in develop- 
ing strategies for extracting significant information from noisy and/or large quantities of 
language data. 
Both the theoretical and practical sides of the research ave demonstrated advances. 
Phonetic regularities have been discovered; phonetic processing architectures and parameter 
tracking methods, and the CDT algorithm have been developed, all of which take into ac- 
count contextual factors associated with phonetic variation. Along with progress in variation, 
a distance metric has been developed for co-channel speech-interference. Finally, progress 
has been furthered in understanding information extraction in unrestricted language data, 
and part-of-speech annotation has been demonstrated. The most recent accomplishments 
include: 
Developed the Clustered Decision Tree algorithm (an n-ary classification induction 
method) which makes use of machine learning and statistical techniques to organize 
data into structures representing the contextual factors associated with phonetic varia- 
tion. \[see Chen et al, DARPA 89 Feb. & Oct. Proceedings\] 
Using the CDT methodology, developed a program to create probabilistic pronunciation 
models in the SRI RULE format. 
Discovered that while identically transcribed phones from different phoneme sources 
may not differ spectrally, they can differ temporally; and an account of the phenomenon 
was developed \[Peet & Withgott, reported at l l6th meeting of the Acous. Soc. Amer.\] 
Developed an LPC-based distance metric for recognition in the presence of competing 
speech in which target-interference separation and target recognition are performed si- 
multaneously b  matching subsets of LPC predictor oots; and achieved error reduction 
of 70% at low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios as compared with conventional whole- 
spectrum matching in speaker-dependent isolated-word recognition experiments. \[see 
Kopec & Bush, ICASSP 89\] 
Applied Markov random fields to (1) extract speech formants without appeal to a 
fixed number of expected resonant frequencies, and (2) "restore" formants, employing 
continuity constraints to allow the missing and noisy formants to be filled in. 
Developed automatic annotation for text using ordinary parts of speech and simple 
long-distance dependencies, without reliance on handmarked training data or upon 
uniformly higher-order Markov models; and achieved 95% correct annotation in a test 
text unrelated in form or content o the training document. \[see Kupiec, DARPA 89
