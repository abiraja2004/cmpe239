Abstract 
Current information extraction efforts 
in the biomedical domain tend to 
focus on finding entities and facts in 
structured databases or MEDLINE? 
abstracts.  We apply a gene and 
protein name tagger trained on 
Medline abstracts (ABGene) to a 
randomly selected set of full text 
journal articles in the biomedical 
domain.  We show the effect of 
adaptations made in response to the 
greater heterogeneity of full text. 
1 Introduction 
The application of large-scale genomics and 
proteomics technologies towards a wide variety 
of biological questions has resulted in a 
continuous stream of information regarding 
thousands of genes and gene products into the 
Medline database of biomedical abstracts.  This 
repository has been recognized as a rich 
knowledge source for biological information 
retrieval, information extraction and text mining.  
However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannot 
contain the same volume of information as the 
full text articles that they represent.  It was 
recently shown that only 30% of protein 
interactions contained in the Dictionary of 
Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al, 
2000) could be found in Medline sentences 
containing DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al, 
2000).  This finding suggests that current 
information extraction efforts being applied to 
biomedical abstracts should be extended to full 
text databases.   
The basic task of identifying gene and 
protein names is a necessary first step towards 
making full use of the information encoded in 
biomedical text.  This remains a challenging 
task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in 
gene and protein nomenclature. The 
irregularities are mainly the result of a lack of 
naming conventions, as well as the widespread 
practice of using many synonyms for one gene 
or protein.  A glance at the Nomenclature 
section of the Nature Genetics website 
(http://www.nature.com/ng/web_specials/nomen
/) shows the scope of the problem, as well as 
ideas for addressing it.  The nomenclature 
guidelines implore authors to consult relevant 
nomenclature committees before announcing 
new genes, and to provide synonyms for genes 
in abstracts.  Additional rules specify that: 
4. Gene symbols are always italicised 
and never contain hyphens, greek 
letters, roman numerals, subscripts or 
superscripts. 
5. All letters in human genes are upper-
case?all letters in mouse genes are 
lower-case? 
 Unfortunately, we are currently at a stage 
where these types of rules are not consistently 
applied to most biomedical abstracts, let alne to 
full text documents.  Until the biomedical 
community adheres uniformly to nomenclature 
guidelines, ambiguities regarding gene/protein 
names will continue to be an obstacle for natural 
language processing of biomedical text.  These 
ambiguities become apparent at the 
morphological, syntactic and semantic levels.  
For example,  caco-2 refers to a cell line, but 
pai-1 is a gene name.  Gene and protein names 
can contain verbs and other parts of speech that 
are hard to distinguish from the surrounding 
text, as in deleted in azoospermia-like, son of 
sevenless, ran, man, young arrest and never in 
mitosis.  Genes can be transfected into cells, or 
combined with chemicals, resulting in 
ambiguous terms like CHO-A(3) and 
ca2+/calmodulin.  The semantic notion of a gene 
or protein is quite arbitrary ? is 
ACTTGGAATGACC a gene name?  In addition 
to sequences, there are mutations, motifs, 
receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels,

consider.  The domain-specific irregularities and 
ambiguities just described are superimposed 
upon the ambiguities in the natural language 
itself, so it is not surprising that the 
identification of gene and protein names in 
biomedical text remains a difficult and 
challenging task.  The methodologies applied to 
this fundamental problem include rule-based 
and/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al, 
1998) (Thomas et al, 2000) (Yoshida et al, 
2000) (Jenssen et al, 2001) (Ono et al, 2001)

al., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) 
(Collier et al, 2000) (Proux et al, 1998), Naive 
Bayes and decision trees (Nobata et al, 1999), 
under specified parsing with knowledge sources 
(Rindflesch et al 2000), and context-free 
grammars (Gaizauskas, 2000). 
In this paper, we evaluate the application of a 
gene and protein name tagger trained on 
Medline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe and 
Wilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of 
1,000 PUBMEDCENTRAL? (PMC) articles.  
PMC is a digital archive of full text peer-
reviewed biomedical articles launched in 
February 2000 by the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the U.S. 
National Library of Medicine (NLM?) (Roberts 
et al, 2001). We present two adaptations made 
in response to the greater heterogeneity of full 
text, and evaluate how they affect the 
performance of ABGene on a test set of 2600 
full text sentences.  
2 Methods 
We first give an overview of ABGene?s 
method for extracting gene and protein names 
from biomedical citations, and then present 
some modifications to ABGene designed to 
improve its performance on full text articles.  
 
2.1 ABGene Overview 
We previously trained the Brill POS tagger 
(Brill, 1994) to recognize protein and gene 
names in biomedical text using a training set of 
7,000 Medline sentences. We updated the 
lexicon included in the Brill package (Brown 
Corpus plus Wall Street Journal corpus) with 
entries from the UMLS? SPECIALIST lexicon 
(McCray et al 1994, Humphreys et al 1998), 
and generated a list of bigrams and a word list 
from all of MEDLINE to customize the training 
for our purposes.  ABGene processing begins by 
using these automatically generated rules from 
the Brill tagger to extract single word gene and 
protein names from biomedical abstracts (see 
Table 1). 
 
    
 
 
 
 
   This is followed by extensive filtering for false 
positives and false negatives. A key step during 
the filtering stage is the extraction of multi-word 
gene and protein names that are prevalent in the 
literature but inaccessible to the Brill tagger. 
 During the false positive filtering step, the 
GENE tag is removed from a word if it matches 
a term from a list of 1,505 precompiled general 
biological terms (acids, antagonist, assembly, 
antigen, etc.), 39 amino acid names, 233 
restriction enzymes, 593 cell lines, 63,698 
organism names from the NCBI Taxonomy

Database (Wheeler et al 2000) or 4,357 non-
biological terms. Non-biological terms were 
obtained by comparing word frequencies in 
MEDLINE versus the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) 
using the following expression, where p is the 
probability of occurrence: 
log(p(word occurs in MEDLINE)/ p(word occurs in WSJ) )< 1 
 Additional false positives are found by regular 
expressions including numbers followed by 
measurements (25 mg/ml) and common drug 
suffixes (-ole, -ane, -ate, -ide, -ine, -ite, -ol, -ose, 
cooh). 
 The false negative filter recovers a single 
word name if it: 1) matches a list of 34,555 
single word names and 7611 compound word 
names compiled from LocusLink (Pruitt & 
Maglott 2001) and the Gene Ontology 
Consortium (2000) (Wain et al, 2002) and 
contains a good context word before or after the 
name, or 2) contains a low frequency trigram 
and a good context word before or after the 
name. The context words were automatically 
generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the 
LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large 
collection of texts in which these gene names 
occur. We computed a log odds score or 
Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words 
indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent 
gene name in the texts.  
Compound word names are recovered using 
terms that occur frequently in known gene 
names.  Recombination of these terms produce 
compound words that also tend to be 
gene/protein names.  These terms include the 
digits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals, 
the Greek letters, functional descriptors 
(adhesion), organism identifiers (hamster), 
activity descriptors (promoting), placement 
indicators (early), and generic descriptors 
(light). In addition to the 415 exact terms, we 
added regular expressions that allow for partial 
matches or special patterns such as words 
without vowels, words with numbers and letters, 
words in capital letters, and common prefixes 
and suffixes (-gene, -like, -ase).   
Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996, 
Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rank 
documents by similarity to documents with 
known gene/protein names. Documents below a 
certain threshold are considered to have no 
gene/protein names in them. 
 
2.2 Modifications for Full Text Articles 
The full text PMC articles are longer than 
abstracts, and contain extraneous information 
like grant numbers and laboratory reagents, 
along with figures and tables.  An attempt to 
take windows of varying sizes of the full text in 
order to rank the windows by similarity to 
abstracts with known gene names was 
unsuccessful.  High scoring windows often hid 
false positives, and low scoring windows could 
contain gene and protein name contexts 
infrequently encountered in Medline abstracts.  
However, we determined that the classifier 
could be used on the sentence level for full text 
articles, and show the effect of an assumption 
that sentences below a zero threshold do not 
contain gene/protein names. 
We tried to increase the performance of 
ABGene on the PMC articles by adding a final  
processing step.  We ran ABGene on 2.16 
million Medline abstracts similar to documents 
with known gene names, and extracted 2.42 
million unique gene/protein names.  We counted 
the number of times each unique name was 
given the GENE tag by ABGene in the 2.16 
million abstracts, and  then extracted three 
groups of putative gene/protein names from this 
large set, with count thresholds at 10 (134,809 
names), 100 (13,865 names) and 1000 (1136 
names).   
During the final stage of processing, terms in 
sentences with scores greater than 2 are checked 
against these lists of supposed gene/protein 
names.  We show the effect of tagging terms 
with counts of at least 10, 100 and 1000 in the 
putative gene/protein list.   
3 Experiment and Results 
We evaluated the performance of ABGene 
on 2600 PMC sentences from 13 score levels 
ranging from ?8 to 60+.  No attempt was made 
to narrow the set using query terms.  The 
sentences were selected as follows:  half of the 
test set consists of the first 100 sentences from 
each score level, and the other half consists of 
100 sentences selected at random from each 
score level.  Precision and recall results are 
shown for each individual score range in Table 
2, and cumulative results are shown in Table 3.  
The number of words tested varies for each 
score level because longer sentences tend to 
have higher scores.  Also, sentences with scores 
near zero tend to be table or figure entries, with 
only a few words each.

precision with 100 count threshold at final step, R 100 = recall with 100 count threshold at final step, P 10 = precision with 10 count 
threshold at final step, R 10 = recall with 10 count threshold at final step.

3.1 Problematic Areas in Full Text 
The false positive gene/protein names found in 
the PMC articles reveal new difficulties for the 
basic task of identifying gene and protein names 
in biomedical text.  For example, in abstracts, 
entities like restriction enzyme sites, laboratory 
protocol kits, primers, vectors, molecular 
biology supply companies and chemical 
reagents are usually scarce.  However, in the 
methods section of a full document, they appear 
regularly, adding to the morphological, syntactic 
and semantic ambiguities previously mentioned.  
Illustrative examples include bio-rad, centricon-
30 spin, xbai sites, mg2, geneamp and pgem3z.  
A significant source of false negatives consists 
of tables and figures from full text, which 
completely lack contextual cues and/or indicator 
words.  These problems can be addressed by 
eliminating processing of materials and methods 
sections, tables and figures.  Another significant 
source of false negatives is an artifact of the 
PMC format, for example, beta is translated to 
[beta], thus a name like beta1 integrin becomes 
[beta]1 integrin in PMC. This is easily 
addressed by removing the PMC formatting 
prior to processing, and has already been 
completed for future work on PMC articles. 
4 Conclusion 
We conclude that an information extraction 
system to tag gene and protein names in 
Medline abstracts (ABGene) can be applied to

have shown how modifications to the processing 
(applying a sentence score threshold, and using 
a large pool of putative gene/protein names) can 
affect the system?s performance.  We are 
currently exploring methods to filter the 2.16 
million putative gene/protein names extracted 
from Medline using our system.  The resulting 
set of gene/protein names, a significant addition 
to the 42K names available from the Gene 
Ontology Consortium and LocusLink, will be 
used to improve the performance of text 
processing on full text articles in the biomedical 
domain.
