Abstract
This paper presents an approach to improving
performance of statistical machine translation
by automatically creating new training data
for difficult to translate phenomena. In partic-
ular this contribution is targeted towards tack-
ling the poor performance of a state-of-the-art
system on negated sentences. The corpus ex-
pansion is achieved by high quality rephrasing
of existing sentences to their negated counter-
parts making use of semantic transfer. The
method is designed to work on both sides of
the parallel corpus while preserving the align-
ment. Our results show an overall improve-
ment of 0.16 BLEU points, with a statisti-
cally significant increase of 1.63 BLEU points
when tested on only negated test data.
1 Introduction
Having large and good quality parallel corpora is vi-
tal for the quality of statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems. However, these corpora are expen-
sive to create. Furthermore, certain phenomena are
not very frequent and hence underrepresented in ex-
isting parallel corpora, such as negated sentences,
questions, etc. Due to the lack of such training data,
the SMT systems do not perform as well as they
could. Especially when it comes to negation, it is
important that the basic semantics is preserved, i.e. a
negated statement should not be translated as a pos-
itive one and vice versa.
Given a state-of-the-art baseline Japanese-English
SMT system, a separate evaluation on the seman-
tic level of negative only vs. positive only test data
reveals the considerably poorer performance on the
negative test set. This tendency and the importance
of preserving a negated statement motivates experi-
ments with improving performance on negative sen-
tences.
Providing more training data for negative sen-
tences should even out the discrepancy of the perfor-
mance between the above mentioned negative and
positive test data. We present a method where a
large amount of negative training data is obtained by
rephrasing the original training data. The rephras-
ing is performed on the semantic level to ensure
high reliability and quality of the generated data.
Simple rewriting based on the surface or syntactic
level would require complex language specific rules,
which is not desirable.
Working on the semantic structure exploits the
fact that these representations abstract away from
language specific structures. Thus, our approach
can be easily implemented for other languages, pro-
vided there are grammars available for both lan-
guages involved in the desired parallel corpus. The
DELPH-IN project1 provides various such gram-
mars.
This paper first describes related work in the fol-
lowing section. Section 3 presents a semantic analy-
sis of the data with respect to negation and provides
some distributional statistics. In Section 4 we elab-
orate on the functionality of our rephrasing system
and present different methods for corpus expansion.
The experimental setup and the results are in Sec-
tion 5. A discussion and our conclusion are given in
Section 6 and Section 7, respectively.
2 Related Work
There has been plenty of work on paraphrasing data
in order to overcome the limitations that insuffi-
ciently large or underrepresented phenomena in par-
1www.delph-in.net
20
allel corpora impose on SMT.
Callison-Burch et al (2006) tackle the problem
of unseen phrases in SMT by adding source lan-
guage paraphrases to the phrase table with appropri-
ate probabilities. Both are obtained from additional
parallel corpora, where the translations of the same
foreign language phrase are considered paraphrases.
He et al (2011) use a statistical framework for
paraphrase generation of the source language. A
log-linear model similar to the one used in phrase-
based SMT provides paraphrases which are ranked
based on novelty and fluency. The training corpus
is then expanded by either adding the first best para-
phrase, or n-best paraphrases. The target language is
just copied to provide the required target side of the
paraphrase.
Marton et al (2009) and Gao and Vogel (2011)
create new information by means of shallow seman-
tic methods. The former present an approach to
overcome the problem of unknown words in a low
resource experiment. They base their monolingual
paraphrasing on semantic similarity measures. In
their setting they achieve significantly better trans-
lations. Gao and Vogel (2011) expand the parallel
corpus by creating new information from existing
data. With the use of a monolingual semantic role
labeller one side of the parallel corpus is labelled.
Role-to-word rules are extracted. In sentences con-
taining the frames and semantic roles for which re-
placement rules exist, the corresponding words are
substituted. A support vector machine is used for
filtering the generated paraphrases.
An approach where paraphrases are obtained via
generation from semantic structures is presented in
Nichols et al (2010). It exploits the fact that the gen-
erator produces multiple surface realizations. The
basic set up is similar to our work, however our ap-
proach additionally manipulates, i.e. rephrases the
semantics before generation. Furthermore, we im-
plement parallel rephrasing, changing the meaning
of both source and target text simultaneously.
There is, on the other hand, little work in phrase-
based SMT especially targeting negated sentences.
Collins et al (2005) approach the problem of prop-
erly translating negation in their general reordering
setting. Transformation rules are applied to syntac-
tic trees, so that the source language word order has
a closer resemblance to the target language word or-
der. In particular, the German negation is moved to-
wards the same position as the English one. This
however presumes the existence of at least some
negated training data.
3 Analysis of the Semantic Structure
The linguistic analysis is performed based on the
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
formalism established in the DELPH-IN project. In
particular we consider the language pair Japanese-
English. Hence, the broad-coverage grammar Jacy
for Japanese (Bender and Siegel, 2004) and the En-
glish Resource Grammar (ERG) (Flickinger, 2000)
are used respectively to parse the data and obtain the
semantics for each sentence.
3.1 Negation in Minimal Recursion Semantics
The formalism that is used to represent the seman-
tics in the DELPH-IN grammars is Minimal Recur-
sion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al, 2005). Per
definition, an MRS structure consists of a top han-
dle, a bag of elementary predicates (EP) and a bag of
constraints on handles. EPs represent verbs, their ar-
guments, negations, quantifiers, among others. Fur-
thermore, each EP has a handle with which it can
be identified. Constraints on handles are used to re-
strict EPs such that they are outscoped by negations
or quantifiers.
In a negated sentence, the negated verb is
outscoped by the negation relation EP. Technically,
the negation relation with handle hn takes as its ar-
gument (ARG1) a handle (hx) which is equal mod-
ulo quantifiers to the handle of the verb (hv), written
as the handle constraint: hx =q hv. For visualiza-
tion, an example is given, which shows the relevant
parts of such a negated structure for the sentence
?This may not suit your taste.? (Figure 1). There,
the negated verb has the handle h8. The negation
relation EP with handle h10 outscopes this via the
constraint h12 =q h8.
The rephrasing we propose can be achieved with
little or no knowledge about the specific implemen-
tation choices of the individual grammar. Collecting
a few sample sentences that appear to be negated in
the original data ? by performing a simple surface
string matching ? is enough to reveal the principle
of how negation is implemented. Because negation

is represented at the semantic level, both the ERG
and Jacy have very similar analyses, even though
the syntactic realization is very different (negation
in English involves a negative marker such as not
and the use of an auxiliary verb such as do, while in
Japanese it is realized by an auxiliary verb nai).
3.2 Data and Distribution of Negations
The data we use in this work is the Japanese-
English parallel Tanaka corpus (Tanaka, 2001; Bond
et al, 2008). We used the version distributed with
Jacy, which has approximately 150,000 sentence
pairs randomly ordered and divided into 100 pro-
files of 1,500 sentences each (the last one is a lit-
tle short). We summarize the distribution of negated
sentence pairs in Table 1. The data we consider for
these statistics excludes development and test pro-
files (000?005). 84.5% of the input sentence pairs
can be parsed successfully (110,759 out of 139,150).
The table also shows mixed cases where one lan-
guage had a negation relation EP, whereas the other
did not. Mixed cases are especially frequent when
the Japanese side has a negation relation. These
cases have two main causes: lexical negation such
as ?She missed the bus.? being translated with the
equivalent of ?She did not catch the bus.?; and id-
ioms, such as ikanakereba naranai ?I must go (lit:
go-not-if not-become)? where the Japanese expres-
sion of modality includes a negation. Instances of
the latter type form the majority, and should be han-
dled in a newer version of the grammar, they are not
considered further in this work.
4 Method: MRS Rephrasing & Corpus
Expansion
The basic setup of the whole rephrasing system con-
sists of parsing, MRS manipulation, generation and
finally parallel corpus compilation. In the follow-
ing sections, the individual processing modules are
described in detail.
4.1 Parsing
Parsing is done using PET (Callmeier, 2000) a
bottom-up chart parser for unification-based gram-
mars using the English and Japanese Grammars
ERG and Jacy. Since our approach builds on seman-
tic rephrasing, only the MRS structure is required.
We only use the best (first) parse returned by the
parser.
4.2 Rephrasing
This module takes an MRS structure as input and
rephrases it if possible by adding a negation rela-
tion EP to the highest scoping predicate. Adding the
negation relation in our current form does not ex-
plore alternatives, where the negation has scope over
22
other EPs in the MRS, nor are more refined changes
from positive to negative polarity items considered.
Before inserting the negation relation EP into the
existing MRS structure with its required handle con-
straint, we have to identify the EP we want to negate.
The event that is introduced by the highest scoping
verb is used. The event variable e2 is directly acces-
sible at the top of the MRS structure (cf. Figure 1).
The corresponding EP that we want to negate has the
event variable as value of its ARG0 attribute. This
EP has a handle h8 that has to be outscoped by the
negation by means of a handle constraint. Hence, a
new negation relation EP (in the example it got the
handle h10) is inserted with the following condition:
Its ARG1 attribute value has to be token identical to
the left side of a =q constraint. The right side is set
to the just identified handle h8 of the verb.
4.3 Generation
The same grammars used for parsing can also be
used by the generator of the Lexical Knowledge
Builder Environment (Copestake, 2002) to gener-
ate an n-best list of surface realizations given an
MRS structure. However, we only consider the high-
est ranked realization. For the English generation,
a generation ranking model is provided within the
DELPH-IN project, thus providing a more confident
n-best list. For the current Japanese grammar, no
such model is available.
An example of a successful generation can be
found in Table 2. On the English side, two surface
variations are generated. The Japanese realizations
show more variations in honorification and aspect.
We can only negate sentence pairs in both lan-
guages for 13.3% of the training data (18,727). This
is mainly because of the brittleness of the Japanese
generation (Goodman and Bond, 2009). Further,
there are multiple ways of negating sentences and
we do not always select the correct one.
4.4 Expanded Parallel Corpus Compilation
The method for assembling the expanded version of
the parallel corpus for the use as training or devel-
opment data directly influences translation quality.
This is also demonstrated in Nichols et al (2010),
where various versions of padding out the data and
preserving the word distribution are compared. The
reported differences in performance suggest the im-
portance of the method. Therefore, we have experi-
mented with the following versions:
? Append: The obtained negated sentence pairs
are added to the original corpus. Only the high-
est ranked realization per sentence for each lan-
guage is considered. Thus they are aligned with
each other. This leads to the addition of the fol-
lowing sentence pair where bilingual negation
was successful:
(en original,jp original)
(en negated 1,jp negated 1) added
? Padding: In order to preserve the word dis-
tribution as mentioned above, we addition-
ally padded out the sentence pairs by copying,
where no bilingual negation was possible:
(en original,jp original)
(en original,jp original) added
? Replace: For emphasizing the impact of
negated sentences, a variant of Append was
compiled. Instead of adding the original pair of
a successful bilingual negation the former was
replaced by the latter:
(en negated 1,jp negated 1) substi-
tuted
Another way of testing the quality of the gener-
ated rephrases is to include them in the language
model training. The expectation is that when the
rephrases are of good quality, then the language
model will be better and in turn should have posi-
tive result on the overall SMT.
5 Experiments & Evaluation
We experiment with the phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation toolkit Moses (Koehn et al, 2007)
in order to train a Japanese - English system and
to show the influence of the expanded parallel cor-
pora obtained with negation rephrasing on transla-
tion performance.
5.1 Data
The Tanaka corpus is used as a basis for our exper-
iments. We tokenize and truecase the English side,
the Japanese side is already tokenized and there are
no case distinctions. Sentences longer than 40 to-
kens are removed. For evaluation, the English part
is recased and detokenized.

Table 2: English and Japanese generations of a successfully rephrased sentence pair.
The sentence and token statistics for the original
Tanaka corpus and our various extensions are listed
in Table 3. The original corpus version acts as base-
line data with profiles 006?100 as training and 000?
002 as development data. For the extended systems,
the training data as described in Section 4.4 is used.
The same methods are applied on the development
portion of the Tanaka corpus for tuning. The full test
data has 42,305 English and 53,242 Japanese tokens
and 4,500 sentences and is equal to the Tanaka cor-
pus profiles 003?005.
The language model training data is in almost all
cases equal to the original English Tanaka training
data. Only in the Append + neg LM experiment, the
training data for the language model is equal to the
Append training data, except that it is slightly larger,
since long sentences have not been filtered out. The
expanded language model training data consists of
1,476,231 tokens and 160,069 sentences.
5.2 Different Test Sets
In order to find out the performance of the baseline
and the extended systems on negative sentences, the
test data has to be split up into several subsets, most
notably neg-strict and pos-strict. The former only
contains negated sentences, the latter only positive
sentences. The definition of both is based on the ex-
istence of a negation relation EP in the semantics of
the sentence. In order to obtain the semantic struc-
ture, the sentence pairs have to be parsed success-
fully. This also means, we will have some sentence
pairs for which we cannot make a decision. There-
fore, we provide a third test subset biparse, which
contains all the parsable sentence pairs. This set re-
veals the big jump of BLEU score compared to the
fourth test set al, which is the regular test set of the
Tanaka corpus. A combined dataset with pos-strict-
neg-strict is provided, which is the union of the first
two sets.
5.3 Setup
We use Moses (SVN revision 4293) with Giza++
(Och and Ney, 2003) and the SRILM toolkit 1.5.12
(Stolcke, 2002). The language model is trained as
a 5-order model with Kneser-Ney discounting. The
Giza++ alignment heuristic grow-diag-final-and is
used. All systems are tuned with MERT (Och,
2003). Several tunings for each system are run, the
best performing ones are reported here.
5.4 Results
The results of our experiments can be seen in Ta-
ble 4. The baseline is outperformed by our two best
variations Append and Append + neg LM with re-
spect to the entire test set. The differences in BLEU
points are 0.14 and 0.16, which are not statistically
significant according to the paired bootstrap resam-
pling method (Koehn, 2004).
When looking at the test set neg-strict that only
contains negated sentences, our improvement is
much more apparent. The gain of our best perform-
ing model Append + neg LM compared to the base-
line is at 1.63 BLEU points, which is statistically
significant (p < 0.05). On the other hand there is
a statistically insignificant drop of 0.30 with pos-
strict.
The model with the expanded language model
training data (Append + neg LM) always performs

better than the model under the same conditions ex-
cept language model training data (Append).
When padding out the original data to preserve the
word distribution in Padding, the effect of the addi-
tional negated training pairs is not strong enough.
Both scores on the entire test set, as well as on the
negation specific test set drop below the baseline.
This version performs slightly better overall com-
pared to Replace, however, on neg-strict it is a lot
worse.
We manually checked the neg-strict test data set
of our best performing system Append + neg LM
versus the baseline, checking only whether the nega-
tion was translated or not (ignoring the overall qual-
ity). For 146 sentences, both systems correctly
translated the negation. For 76 sentences both sys-
tems failed to translate the negation. For 33 sen-
tences Append + neg LM translated the negation
where the baseline system did not, and for 30 sen-
tences the baseline system translated the negation
but Append + neg LM did not. Overall, we reduced
the number of critical negation errors from 99 to 96.
Some example sentences are given in Figure 2.
6 Discussion
For identifying the performance of a state-of-the-art
baseline system on negated sentences, we have split
the test data into several distinct sets. The transla-
tion quality drops considerably by about 3 BLEU
points when looking at the negative data compared
to the parsable test data biparse. This big decline
and the difference between performance on negative
vs. positive test data shows that there is great poten-
tial to improve SMT systems by tackling this prob-
lem. Our approach is successful in handling nega-
tions better and thus diminishing the discrepancy of
the two sets.
As the results show, there is only a small decrease
of BLEU score points on the positive test data. And
on the negative test data, the increase is substan-
tially higher. Nevertheless, the overall performance
in terms of BLEU only reflects this high increase to
a certain degree. This can be attributed to the fact
that the test data has a similar distribution to that of
the training data, i.e. the proportion of negative sen-
tences is low. Thus, the big increase gets diluted in
the overall test data.
The results further show that improvement on the
negative test data set comes at the cost of a slight
degradation of performance on the positive data set
and hence also on the full test set. This behaviour
is not surprising due to the fact that a positive and
its negative correspondent only vary very little when
looking at the surface structure. The models trained
with our extended data are aimed at providing one
model which provides a balance between this gain
and the loss.
This notion suggests that one would benefit from
providing two separate translation models, one for
negated input data and one for positive data. In this
setting, the ample amount of negative training data
that we generated through rephrasing could be ex-
ploited even more. A yet higher increase of BLEU
score is expected. This of course requires a prepro-
cessing step that confidently splits up the data ac-
cordingly. However, since we have the grammars at
hand that can reliably determine whether there is a
semantic negation relation in the input, this step can
be solved easily. One small disadvantage with this
idea is that a decision can only be made if the gram-

mar of the input language produces a parse for the
input sentence. This however can be circumvented
by backing off to the well balanced model presented
in this work. In other words, we use a positive model
for positive sentences, a negative model for negative
sentences and a balanced model if we are not sure.
Our method depends on two large-scale deep se-
mantic grammars. However, developing such gram-
mars has been made much more efficient with the
emergence of the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al,
2002). There is is already a large collection of work-
ing grammars, which can readily be tried out. In
addition to the ERG and Jacy, there are grammars
for German, French, Korean, Modern Greek, Nor-
wegian, Spanish, Portuguese, and more, with vary-
ing levels of coverage.2
Because parsing, rephrasing and generation do
not have 100% coverage, we cannot produce negated
versions of all sentences. The rephrasing can only
work when both sides of a sentence pair are parsable.
Furthermore, not every rephrased sentence pair can
be successfully realized. However, we still manage
to build far more negated training data than is oth-
erwise available: more than doubling the amount.
This could be further increased by a little more work
on the generation, especially for Jacy. In addition,
we have not made use of all the generated data, i.e.
lower ranked realizations have been discarded even
though they may still be useful.
Furthermore, we have shown in the experiment re-
sults that using our expanded version for language
model training is also of great benefit, since we
could achieve not only an overall increase, but es-
pecially one on negated test data.

7 Conclusion & Future Work
We have presented an approach which alleviates
the negation translation difficulties of phrase-based
SMT. We have tackled the problem by automati-
cally expanding the training data with negated sen-
tence pairs. The additional data has been obtained
by rephrasing existing data based on the semantic
structure of the input.
Our experiments with the phrase-based SMT sys-
tem Moses show small improvements over the base-
line considering the entire test data. A more dis-
tinct look at only negated sentences in the test data
shows a statistically significant improvement of 1.63
BLEU points. The best performing model represents
a good balance of a high BLEU score increase on the
negated test data vs. a statistically insignificant de-
crease on the positive test data, yet achieving a small
overall improvement. Furthermore, it was shown,
that expanding not only the translation training data,
but also the language model training data boosts per-
formance even more.
Our method works on the semantic level and can
be easily adapted to other languages. Having ac-
cess to a deep semantic structure opens possible ex-
tensions along our idea. On the one hand negation
rephrasing could be refined in order to have a higher
generation rate. On the other hand, other phenomena
could also be tackled in the same way: e.g. rephras-
ing declarative statements to interrogatives.
Just for negation, the corpora expanded with our
high quality negations could be combined with the
syntactic reordering strategies presented in Section 2
such that the negation reordering rule has more train-
ing data and thus a bigger influence on the overall
performance.

Japanese ???????????????
Baseline They played tennis yesterday.
Append + neg LM They do not play tennis yesterday.
Reference Yesterday they didn?t play tennis, because it rained.
(a) Baseline fails to translate the negation.
Japanese ?????????????????????????
Baseline He is sure to break your promise, I?m sure.
Append + neg LM He never breaks his word, I?m sure.
Reference I?m sure he won?t fail to keep his word.
(b) Correct translation by our system with valid variation of wording.
Japanese ??????????????????????
Baseline I was when I came home, he was asleep.
Append + neg LM I came home when he is not asleep.
Reference He wasn?t sleeping when I came home.
(c) Baseline omits the negation.
Japanese ???????????????
Baseline Money with me.
Append + neg LM I don?t have any money with me.
Reference I don?t have any money with me.
(d) Baseline omits subject, verb and negation.
Japanese ???????????????????
Baseline The???? in Japan, I cannot see it.
Append + neg LM The???? in Japan.
Reference The Southern Cross is not to be seen in Japan.
(e) Our system does not translate a part of the sentence.
Japanese ????????????
Baseline Don?t speak in a loud voice.
Append + neg LM You must speak in a loud voice.
Reference You must not speak loudly.
(f) Our system omits the negation.
Japanese ??????????
Baseline She has no friends.
Append + neg LM She is a friend of mine.
Reference She doesn?t have a boy friend.
(g) Our system does not produce a negation. The object is incorrectly trans-
lated in both systems.
