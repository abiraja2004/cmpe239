Abstract
The paper presents a rule-based information
extraction (IE) system for Polish medical
texts. We select the most important informa-
tion from diabetic patients? records. Most
data being processed are free-form texts,
only a part is in table form. The work has
three goals: to test classical IE methods on
texts in Polish, to create relational database
containing the extracted data, and to prepare
annotated data for further IE experiments.
1 Introduction
Information extraction from natural language text
has become an important task for NLP applica-
tions during the last years. In the era of huge text
data collections, these methods allows us to per-
form searches within reasonable time. For the pur-
pose of IE, many methods based on very differ-
ent approaches (formal grammars, statistics, artifi-
cial intelligence) have already been elaborated. In
spite of a great number of described experiments,
the invented methods were untested on Polish texts.
Nowadays, there is great interest in statistical and
machine learning methods, e.g. (Bunescu et al,
2003), but applying machine learning techniques to
Polish texts is difficult, as there are hardly any an-
notated Polish data (excluding morpho-syntactic in-
formation which is available). The second obstacle
was the type of chosen data ? relatively low num-
ber of available records with complex text. That is
why we decided to carry out a rule-based IE sys-
tem.1 Below, we present the system selecting infor-
mation from diabetic patients? hospital records writ-
ten in unrestricted Polish. We defined a domain de-
pendent set of rules basing on an expert?s knowl-
edge and tested them on the previously unseen re-
ports. The extracted data were put into a database
allowing for statistical analysis. The other result of
the project, the annotated set of original reports, can
be further used for applying other methods of IE to
these texts.
In our project, we use the SProUT (Shallow Pro-
cessing with Unification and Typed Feature Struc-
tures) system, (Droz?dz?yn?ski et al, 2004). SProUT
is a general purpose platform consisting of a set of
components for basic linguistic operations. Gram-
mar rules are regular expressions on typed feature
structures (TFS) which are results of tokenization
or morphological analysis, as well as information
from the domain lexicon. SProUT differs frommany
other systems in that it allows for unification of TFSs
thus allows more general extraction rules. Analysing
Polish text is possible due to the integration (Pisko-
rski et al, 2004) of Morfeusz, a morphological anal-
yser for Polish (Wolin?ski, 2006).
Although most biomedical IE activities are related
to literature mining and terminology extraction, (e.g.
(Bunescu et al, 2003), (Tveit and Saetre 2005)),
clinical patients record mining is not a new research
goal for all languages, e.g. (Hahn, Romacker and
Schulz, 2002). In (Hripcsak et al, 2002) 24 clini-
cal conditions were extracted from narrative chests
radiographic reports. The task closest to the pre-
1Our first rule-based IE experiment concerned mammogra-
phy reports (Mykowiecka, Kups?c? and Marciniak, 2004).
35
sented here, i.e. searching for information contained
in natural language patients? discharge summaries
was undertaken in project MENELAS (Zweigen-
baum, 1994) and AMBIT (Harkema et al, 2004). In
the last one, the extraction rules were based on both
syntactic (word category) and semantic information
(e.g. latitude-noun or area-noun). 83 radiology re-
ports were processed and descriptions of lung can-
cers extracted and evaluated. The exemplary results
for location were: 61% precision and 92% recall.
Results of our experiment are shown in sections 4
and 6.
2 Domain description
For the purpose of diabetic patients? hospital docu-
mentation analysis, we elaborated a domain model
for the part of data which we are interested in. The
model has been defined on the basis of an expert?s
knowledge and the data i.e. hospital documents. The
model describes information on a patient, hospitali-
sation, diagnosis, tests, treatment and complications.
To formalize it, we used OWL-DL standard and the
Prot?g? ontology editor. A part of the diabetes on-
tology is shown in Fig. 1.
For the purpose of information extraction in
SProUT, the ontology had to be translated (manu-
ally) into a typed feature structures hierarchy. In the
extraction system, the domain model is represented
by typed TFSs. A feature?s (attribute?s) value can be
an atomic type, another TFS, or a list of atomic types
or TFSs. The type hierarchy contains 139 types
with 65 attributes, but as much as 65 types represent
medicine terms.
An example of a structure defined to represent ba-
sic information about a patient?s diabetes is given in
Fig. 2. The structure is of the type diabet_desc_str
and has five attributes. A value of the D_TYPE at-
tribute has the type of d_type_t which is a supertype
for three types of diabetes: first, second, other. The
next attribute HBA1C refers to the results of an im-
portant diabetes monitoring test. Its numerical value
is represented as a string. Next two attributes are
of boolean type and indicate if the illness is uncon-
trolled and if the patient had incidences of hypogly-
caemia. A value of the last attribute DIAB_FROM
is another TFS of type diab_from_str representing
when the diabetes have been diagnosed. This infor-

Every one document we process concerns one pa-
tient?s visit in hospital. A particular visit is identified
(see Fig. 3) by two parameters: ID number within
a year and a year (attribute ID_YEAR). Sometimes
some results of tests are available after the patient
leaves the hospital. In such cases, there are addi-
36
tional hospital documents referring to these visits
described by an attribute CONT: yes ? continua-
tion.

Figure 3: Visit?s identification structure
The specific structures are defined for represent-
ing the following information:
? identification of a patient?s visit in hospital,
dates when the hospitalisation took place, and
its reasons,
? patient information: identification, age, sex,
weight,
? data about diabetes (see Fig. 2),
? complications,
? other illnesses including autoimmunology and
accompanying illnesses, which may be corre-
lated with diabetes, like hypertension,
? diabetes treatment: recognition of insulin type
and its doses and other oral medications,
? diet: how many calories, and how many meals
are recommended,
? patient?s education, observing of diet, modifi-
cation of treatment or diet.
In order to represent complications we defined
the appropriate hierarchy. It contains three main
types of complications: angiopathy, neuropathy and
diabetic foot. The first two have subtypes. An-
giopathy divides into micro and macroangiopathy,
and neuropathy can be autonomic neuropathy or pe-
ripheral polineuropathy. Micro and macroangiopaty
has further subtypes. One common complication ?
rethinopathy is a subtype of microangiopathy and
has additional attribute, that represents information
about cooccurring maculopathy. Rethinopathy has
also subtypes.
Sometimes it is convenient to recognise more then
one complication through one rule. In this case, re-
sults are represented in a list. For example, the re-
sult of recognition of the following phrase describ-
ing complications z neuropatia? autonomiczna? i ob-
wodowa? ?with autonomic and peripheral neuropa-
thy? is represented in Fig. 4. These two complica-
tions cannot be identified separately, as there is only
one occurrence of the keyword neuropathy.

3 Information Extraction
3.1 Domain dictionary ? gazetteer
A domain dictionary contains all forms of the terms
important to the domain terminology. These terms
came from the data set or were introduced into the
lexicon on the basis of a domain expert?s knowl-
edge. The lexicon contains among others all insulin
and oral medication names important in diabetology,
we introduced forms in nominative and genitive (if
such exist) ? only these forms appeared in the doc-
uments. The other group of words in the dictionary
consists of names of diseases and diabetic complica-
tions. They have been introduced into the lexicon in
all forms used in the documents.
In this specific domain lexicon, there are no in-
formation about grammatical categories because it
is not used within the grammar rules. In the dictio-
nary, we have only semantic information about en-
tries. There are two levels of semantic information:
GTYPE ? groups entries with a similar meaning,
and G_CONCEPT connects an entry with its unique
interpretation. The lexicon is rather small ? just
over 200 word forms. In Fig. 5, there is a fragment
of the gazetteer with eight entries. All of them refer
to different types of neuropathy complications.
3.2 Grammar rules
A grammar in SProUT consists of rules, which are
regular expressions over TFSs with functional oper-
ators and coreferences, representing the recognition

G_CONCEPT: autonomic_neuropathy
Figure 5: A fragment of gazetteer
pattern. Output structures are also TFSs. Rules use
three sources of information: tokenization (struc-
tures of type token for recognising, among others,
abbreviations, dates, numbers), morphological anal-
ysis (structures of type morph), and a domain dictio-
nary (gazetteer).
The SProUT grammar described in the paper con-
sists of about 100 extraction rules. Each rule detects
words or phrases describing information presented
in section 2. For example, the rule in Fig. 6 recog-
nises the identification number of a patient?s visit in
hospital. The first line recognises a word from mor-
phological lexicon that has the base form (STEM)
numer ?number? or an abbreviation2 of this word, so
they are recognised as a token with an appropriate
SURFACE form. The next line: token? omits a
dot after the abbreviation, if it is necessary. Next two
lines recognise the keywords with the base forms
ksie?ga (?book?, ?document?) and g??wny (?main?).
Then, the identification number of the document is
recognised by the liczba_nat rule called (via the
@seek operator). The number is unified with the
value of the ID attribute in the output structure. Next
two lines are optional, they recognise a year num-
ber after a slash or a backslash, if this information
is present. If not, the year is fixed, during postpro-
cessing, according to the dates of the patient?s visit
in hospital. In this particular case, the value of the
attribute CONT is no in the output structure. The
rule in Fig. 6 captures, among other, the following
phrases:
? Numer ksie?gi g??wnej 11125/2006
?Number of the main document 11125/2006?

nary.

The grammar rules recognising the important in-
formation are often relatively simple. There is no
need to use any morphological features in rules, be-
cause we do not have to precisely delimit phrases.
Searched (key) phrases consist very often of words
which are very strongly connected with particular
notions. For example, if we find a phrase stopy
cukrzycowej ?diabetic foot?, it is practically certain
that it concerns a complication. Only base word
forms (values of STEM attribute) from the morpho-
logical analyser output turned out to be necessary
here.
Fig. 7 contains a simple rule recognising autoim-
munology diseases. It seeks for any occurrence of
the following pattern: <disease, autoimmunology-
disease-specification>. The first line of the rule
recognises a word: choroba or zesp?? e.g., ?disease?.
The second line requires an entry from the domain
dictionary which represents an autoimmunology dis-
ease. Its type (variable #type ) is unified with the
value of the attribute AUTOIMM_DISEASE in the
output structure.
3.3 Difficult Issues
Although the results of the program are quite good,
there are some difficult issues which cause errors.
38
We have to cope with negation, which some-
times is difficult to determine. In the following
phrase: bez obecnos?ci retinopatii ?without presence
of retinopathy?, it is not enough to identify the key-
word retinopatii ?retinopathy?, it is necessary to
recognise negation expressed in the form of the neg-
ative preposition bez ?without?. Here, the negation
appeared just before the keyword, and it can be eas-
ily noticed, but sometimes a negation is far from
a keyword, and is difficult to process with shallow
parsing methods. Let us consider the following sen-
tence: Nie stwierdzono p?z?nych powik?an? cukrzycy
o typie mikroangiopatii. ?there were no long-lasting
diabetes complications of microagiopathy type ?. In
this case, the negation nie stwierdzono ?there were
no? is at the beginning of the sentence and the key-
word mikroangiopatii ?microangiopathy? is the last
word of the sentence. The above phrase is recog-
nised with the rule in Fig. 8. It refers to the base
forms of certain words and to the domain lexicon in
order to identify a complication (variable #t). The
same rule recognise, among other, the following
phrases which meaning is the same as the previous
one.
? nie wykryto obecnos?ci p?z?nych powik?an?
cukrzycowych pod postacia? mikroangiopatii,
? nie wyste?puja? p?z?ne powik?ania cukrzycowe o
charakterze mikroangiopatii,
? Nie stwierdzono p?z?nych zmian cukrzycowych
w postaci mikroangiopatii.
In the very similar example: Nie stwierdzono
p?z?nych powik?an? cukrzycy z wyja?tkiem mikroan-
giopatii. ?there were no long-lasting diabetes com-
plications excluding microagiopathy? the case is just
the opposite, and the microangiopathy should be
recognised. So, to properly identify whether a pa-
tient has or hasn?t microangiopathy we have to anal-
yse the whole sentence.
Some problems are caused by keywords which
have different interpretation depending on the con-
text. e.g., mikroalbuminuria refers to a complication
in the phrase wysta?pi?a mikroalbuminuria ?microal-
buminuria appeared? and denotes a test in the phrase
Mikroalbuminuria: 25 mg/dobe? ?Microalbuminuria:
25 mg/day?. In this case we determine the meaning
of an ambiguous notion according to its context.

Figure 8: The rule recognising the lack of a specified
complication
The next thing that should be taken into account,
is that sometimes several pieces of information have
to be recognised with one rule. In the following co-
ordinated phrase: retinopatie? prosta? oka lewego oraz
proliferacyjna oka prawego z makulopatia? w obu
oczach ?nonproliferative rethinopathy in the left eye
and proliferative (rethinopathy) in the right eye with
maculopathy in both eyes? we have to recognise both
types of rethinopathy with maculopathy and create
a list of complications as the output structure, see
Fig. 9. The rule almost entirely refers to notions
from the domain dictionary. It identifies a combi-
nation of notions denoting retinopathy. The domain
dictionary contains both Polish and Latin (words in
this case both languages are used by doctors) refer-
ring to this complication.
In order to recognise precisely given information,
one tends to write complex rules describing entire
phrases instead of separated terms. The crucial prob-
lem for the effectiveness of complex IE rules is that
Polish is a free word language. This greatly in-
creases the number of ways the same idea can be
expressed. Let us consider the following examples:
? Wieloletnia, niekontrolowana cukrzyca typu 2,
long-lasting uncontrolled diabetes type 2,
? Niekontrolowana, wieloletnia cukrzyca typu 2,
? Wieloletnia cukrzyca typu 2, niekontrolowana,
? Cukrzyca wieloletnia typu 2, niekontrolowana.

Figure 9: Retinopathy coordination rule
All phrases mean: ?Long-lasting, uncontrolled, type
2 diabetes?. Every word of these phrases carries
important information: wieloletni ?long-lasting?,
niekontrolowany ?uncontrolled?, typ 2 ?type 2?. But
they should be identified as important only in con-
text of the keyword cukrzyca ?diabetes?. The only
solution is to recognise the whole phrase through
one rule. So, we ought to predict all possible config-
urations of words and write a lot of rules that identify
subsequent permutations of keywords, which might
be difficult. Thus, some omissions of information
can be caused by insufficient coverage by grammar
rules (see sec. 4).
The information we searched for can be divided
into two types. Many facts were originally written
in the documents in a standardised way, for example
the value of the BMI parameter, or phrases describ-
ing complications. For these parts of information,
the probability of error is rather small and is related
mostly to the occurrence of complicated negation or
coordination. But some of the features can be ex-
pressed in many ways. In this case, the program re-
call can depend on the particular physicians? writing
styles. An example is the information about contin-
uation of diabetes treatment. In this case we have
to identify information about continuation of a treat-
ment (can be expressed in many ways) in the con-
text of a phrases denoting diabetes. This context is
important because, in the texts, there are sometimes
phrases describing continuation of treatment of not
diabetes but other illness. A few samples are given
below:
? Kontynuowano leczenie cukrzycy dotychcza-
sowym systemem wielokrotnych wstrzyknie?c?
?The diabetes treatment was continued on the
same basis of multiple injections?,
? Utrzymano dotychczasowy system wielokrot-
nych wstrzyknie?c? insuliny ?The current system
of multiple insulin injections has been main-
tained?,
? Kontynuowano dotychczasowy schemat
leczenia cukrzycy ?The current schema of
diabetes treatment was continued?,
? Kontynuowano dotychczasowe leczenie
hipotensyjne ?The current treatment of hy-
potension was continued? ? this phrase is not
about diabetes!
A fact that a patient was educated for diabetes is
another example of information which can be ex-
pressed in many ways. Any phrase indicating that
a patient was informed or taught about something
or something was discussed with a patient is inter-
preted as the information about education. We are
not interested in details of education but still we
have to recognise 13 different constructions describ-
ing education.
? Om?wiono z chorym zasady diety, samokon-
troli i adaptacji dawek insuliny ?Diet, self-
control and adaptation of insulin doses were
discussed with the patient?,
? Nauczono chorego pos?ugiwac? sie pompa? in-
sulinowa? i glukometrem. ?The patient was
taught how to use an insulin pump and a glu-
cometer.?,
? W czasie pobytu w Klinice prowadzono
edukacje? chorej dotycza?ca? cukrzycy. ?During
the patient stay in the Clinic, the patient was
educated for diabetes.?,
40
? Po odbyciu szkolenia z zakresu podstawowych
wiadomos?ci o cukrzycy wypisano chora?... ?Af-
ter learning the basic information about dia-
betes, the patient was discharged...?.
4 IE results evaluation
Part of the data was used as a training set, the eval-
uation was made on the other 50 previously unseen
reports. From above 60 attributes, the partial eval-
uation concerned only 7. The evaluated attributes
are of different type: retinopathy is a keyword but
we still deal with the problem of negation and coor-
dination. Words denoting uncontrolled diabetes can
refer not only to diabetes so they should be recog-
nized only in specific contexts. Attributes: educa-
tion and diet modification are represented in the texts
by complex phrases.
Results are presented in Fig. 10. The worst results
were observed for diabetes balance recognition. It
was due to the fact that keywords representing this
information had to be recognised in the context of
the word cukrzyca ?diabetes?, (see 3.3) and some-
times the distance between these words is too far. 4
occurrences of wrongly recognised retinopathywere
caused by the unpredicted negated phrases.

5 Database Organization
The data obtained from the IE system is a huge XML
file. The attribute values included within it were
subsequently introduced into a relational database
which can be searched and analysed. At the database
filling stage some additional postprocessing of data
was done. This concerned, among others, the fol-
lowing problems:
? detection and omission of information of pa-
tient not suffering from diabetes,
? detection and omission of not complete data
(reports not sufficiently filled up with data),
? omission of redundant data and choosing the
most detailed information (e.g. about types of
complications)
? selecting highest levels for blood test results.
The database consists of 20 tables containing all ex-
tracted information about a patient, his/her illness
and the recommended treatment. At the moment, the
database contains 388 hospitalisation descriptions of
387 patients. 254 cases were qualified as diabetes
type 2, 129 as type 1 and 5 as type other. 556 com-
plications for 256 patients and 304 insulin treatment
schemas have been recognised.
6 System Overview and Evaluation
The main aim of the work was creation of a system
that processes diabetic patients? hospital documenta-
tion automatically and inserts the extracted data into
a relational database. The database can be searched
for using SQL queries or a specialized program ded-
icated for doctors which enables queries by exam-
ple. The system architecture is given in Fig. 11. The
processing procedure consisted of four stages:
? text preprocessing including format unification
and data anonymization (Perl scripts),
? information extraction based on the domain
model (Prot?g?), Polish morphological lexicon
(Morfeusz) and the domain lexicon,
? postprocessing: data cleaning and structuring
(Perl scripts),
? insertion data into a relational database (Post-
gres).
The evaluation of the system was done simultane-
ously with IE evaluation on the same set of 50 re-
ports. The results are presented in Fig. 12. The final
recognition of the uncontrolled diabetes was higher
due to repetition of the same information in one doc-
ument.

7 Conclusions
For the chosen domain, the rule-based IE method
seems to be the best one. Learning techniques are
hard to apply due to: a great number of attributes
searched for (in comparison to the amount of avail-
able texts) and their inter connections and crucial de-
pendence on negation and coordination occurrences.
Good precision and recall values make this method
practically usable for information extraction from
free patients? documentation. We plane to use our
tools for creating annotated corpora (manually cor-
rected) which are necessary for training statistical
models.
Of course the portability of the method is poor.
The grammars written for a particular domain can
be developed to cover more facts and details but their
extendibility to another domain is problematic.
