OBJECTIVE 
The core objective of the research is to encode speech into segments which retain ecessary 
information for accurate continuous speech recognition, but are more efficient to deal with 
than the usual encoding of short fxames of speech. We use a multi-stage decision-tree 
encoder with linear combinations of features at the decision odes; the result is segments 
which cover multiple frames and which are coded with the terminal node number of the 
final tree. 
Additional contract objectives include showing that application knowledge can be efficiently 
applied to these codes to produce accurate transcriptions. The Knowledge Systems 
Laboratory at Stanford University is to help test he result in an application-development 
environment. The contract isto produce results which can be employed ina commercial 
system at the end of the contract. 
SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
We showed that segmenting and coding speech using SSI's phonetic encoding 
significantly improves both speed and accuracy for a system using Markov modelling. 
We reduced utterance error ate by 25.7% with a further 40% increase in speed by 
reducing the number of ways words were spelled in the dictionary and by re-defining 
the phonetic lasses. 
The word error in decoding of phonetic odes into words was further decreased by a 
typical 20% using a penalty that reduced the erroneous insertion of smail words. 
Speed of recognition was further increased by a factor of two by using a more efficient 
structure in the decoding software. 
Software was modified to provide access to transcriptions other than the best guess 
(e.g., the second through tenth best guesses) to aid the user in making corrections. 
Software was also modified to give application developers access to semantic knowledge 
inherent in the structure of the language model used in the recognition process; for 
example, various names that a radiologist called a tumor seen in an xray (mass, density, 
tumor, etc.) would all be labeUed "tumor." 
PLANS 
Larger segments and other variations will be tested in a Markov model environment. 
Contract improvements in SSI's Phonetic Engine will be integrated, tested as a whole, and 
performance r ported on RM data.
