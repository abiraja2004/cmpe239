Abstract
We propose a joint model for unsuper-
vised induction of sentiment, aspect and
discourse information and show that by in-
corporating a notion of latent discourse re-
lations in the model, we improve the pre-
diction accuracy for aspect and sentiment
polarity on the sub-sentential level. We
deviate from the traditional view of dis-
course, as we induce types of discourse re-
lations and associated discourse cues rel-
evant to the considered opinion analysis
task; consequently, the induced discourse
relations play the role of opinion and as-
pect shifters. The quantitative analysis that
we conducted indicated that the integra-
tion of a discourse model increased the
prediction accuracy results with respect to
the discourse-agnostic approach and the
qualitative analysis suggests that the in-
duced representations encode a meaning-
ful discourse structure.
1 Introduction
With the rapid growth of the Web, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to discern useful from irrel-
evant information, particularly in user-generated
content, such as product reviews. To make it easier
for the reader to separate the wheat from the chaff,
it is necessary to structure the available informa-
tion. In the review domain, this is done in aspect-
based sentiment analysis which aims at identify-
ing text fragments in which opinions are expressed
about ratable aspects of products, such as ?room
quality? or ?service quality?. Such fine-grained
analysis can serve as the first step in aspect-based
sentiment summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004), a
task with many practical applications.
Aspect-based summarization is an active re-
search area for which various techniques have
been developed, both statistical (Mei et al, 2007;
Titov and McDonald, 2008b) and not (Hu and Liu,
2004), and relying on different types of supervi-
sion sources, such as sentiment-annotated texts or
polarity lexica (Turney and Littman, 2002). Most
methods rely on local information (bag-of-words,
short ngrams or elementary syntactic fragments)
and do not attempt to account for more complex
interactions. However, these local lexical repre-
sentations by themselves are often not sufficient to
infer a sentiment or aspect for a fragment of text.
For instance, in the following example taken from
a TripAdvisor1 review:
Example 1. The room was nice but let?s not talk
about the view.
it is difficult to deduce on the basis of local lexical
features alone that the opinion about the view is
negative. The clause let?s not talk about the view
could by itself be neutral or even positive given the
right context (e.g., I?ve never seen such a fancy ho-
tel room, my living room doesn?t look that cool...
and let?s not talk about the view). However, the
contrast relation signaled by the connective but
makes it clear that the second clause has a nega-
tive polarity. The same observations can be made
about transitions between aspects: changes in as-
pect are often clearly marked by discourse connec-
tives. Importantly, some of these cues are not dis-
course connectives in the strict linguistic sense and
are specific to the review domain (e.g., the phrase
I would also in a review indicates that the topic
is likely to be changed). In order to accurately
predict sentiment and topic,2 a model needs to ac-

2In what follows, we use the terms aspect and topic, inter-1630
count for these discourse phenomena and cannot
rely solely on local lexical information.
These issues have not gone unnoticed to the re-
search community. Consequently, there has re-
cently been an increased interest in models that
leverage content and discourse structure in senti-
ment analysis tasks. However, discourse-level in-
formation is typically incorporated in a pipeline
architecture, either in the form of sentiment po-
larity shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006; Naka-
gawa et al, 2010) that operate on the lexical level
or by using discourse relations (Taboada et al,
2008; Zhou et al, 2011) that comply with dis-
course theories like Rhetorical Structure Theory
(RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988). Such ap-
proaches have a number of disadvantages. First,
they require additional resources, such as lists of
polarity shifters or discourse connectives which
signal specific relations. These resources are avail-
able only for a handful of languages. Second, re-
lying on a generic discourse analysis step that is
carried out before sentiment analysis may intro-
duce additional noise and lead to error propaga-
tion. Furthermore, these techniques will not nec-
essarily be able to induce discourse relations in-
formative for the sentiment analysis domain (Voll
and Taboada, 2007).
An alternative approach is to define a task-
specific scheme of discourse relations (Somasun-
daran et al, 2009). This previous work showed
that task-specific discourse relations are helpful in
predicting sentiment, however, in doing so they re-
lied on gold-standard discourse annotation at test
time rather than predicting it automatically or in-
ducing it jointly with sentiment polarity.
We take a different approach and induce dis-
course and sentiment information jointly in an un-
supervised (or weakly supervised) manner. This
has the advantage of not having to pre-specify a
mapping from discourse cues to discourse rela-
tions; our model induces this automatically, which
makes it portable to new domains and languages.
Joint induction of discourse and sentiment struc-
ture also has the added benefit that the model is
able to learn exactly those aspects of discourse
structure that are relevant for sentiment analysis.
We start with a relatively standard joint model
of sentiment and topic, which can be regarded as a
cross-breed between the JST model (Lin and He,
2009) and the ASUM model (Jo and Oh, 2011),
changeably as well as sentiment levels and opinion polarity.
both state-of-the-art techniques. This model is
weakly supervised, as it relies solely on document-
level (i.e. not aspect-specific) opinion polarity la-
bels to induce topics and sentiment on the sub-
sentential level. In order to test our hypothesis
that discourse information is beneficial, we add
a discourse modeling component. Note that in
modeling discourse we do not exploit any kind
of supervision. We demonstrate that the resulting
model outperforms the baseline on a product re-
view dataset (see Section 5).
To the best of our knowledge, unsupervised
joint induction of discourse structure, sentiment
and topic information has not been considered
before, particularly not in the context of the
aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Importantly,
our method for discourse modeling is a general
method which can be integrated in virtually any
LDA-style model of aspect and sentiment.
2 Modeling Discourse Structure
Discourse cues typically do not directly indicate
sentiment polarity (or aspect). However, they can
indicate how polarity (or aspect) changes as the
text unfolds. As we have seen in the examples
above, changes in polarity can happen on a sub-
sentential level, i.e., between adjacent clauses or,
from a discourse-theoretic point of view, between
adjacent elementary discourse units (EDUs). To
model these changes we need a strong linguistic
signal, for example, in the form of discourse con-
nectives or other discourse cues. We hypothesize
that these are more likely to occur at the beginning
of an EDU than in the middle or at the end. This is
certainly true for most of the traditional discourse
relation cues (particularly connectives).
Changes in polarity or aspect are often cor-
related with specific discourse relations, such as
?contrast?. However, not all relations are rele-
vant and there is no one-to-one correspondence
between relations and sentiment changes.3 Fur-
thermore, if a discourse relation signals a change,
it is typically ambiguous whether this change oc-
curs with the polarity (example 1) or the aspect
(the room was nice but the breakfast was even bet-
ter) or both (the room was nice but the breakfast
was awful). Therefore, we do not explicitly model
3The ?explanation? relation, for example, can occur with
a polarity change (We were upgraded to a really nice room
because the hotel made a terrible blunder with our booking)
but does not have to (The room was really nice because the
hotel was newly renovated).1631

Table 1: Discourse relations
generic discourse relations; instead, inspired by
the work of Somasundaran et al (2008), we define
three very general relations which encode how po-
larity and aspect change (Table 1). Note that we
do not have a discourse relation SameSame since
we do not expect to have strong linguistic evidence
which states that an EDU contains the same senti-
ment information as the previous one.4 However,
we assume that the sentiment and topic flow is
fairly smooth in general. In other words, for two
adjacent EDUs not connected by any of the above
three relations, the prior probability of staying at
the same topic and sentiment level is higher than
picking a new topic and sentiment level (i.e. we
use ?sticky states? (Fox et al, 2008)).
3 Model
In this section we describe our Bayesian model,
first the discourse-agnostic model and then an ex-
tension needed to encode discourse information.
The formal generative story is presented in Fig-
ure 1: the red fragments correspond to the dis-
course modeling component. In order to obtain the
generative story for the discourse-agnostic model,
they simply need to be ignored.
3.1 Discourse-agnostic model
In our approach we make an assumption that all
the words in an EDU correspond to the same topic
and sentiment level. We also assume that an over-
all sentiment of the document is defined, this is
the only supervision we use in inducing the model.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and
McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect-
specific sentiment to be the same across the docu-
ment. We describe our discourse-agnostic model
by first describing the set of corpus-level and
document-level parameters, and then explain how
the content of each document is generated.
Drawing model parameters On the corpus
level, for every topic z ? {1, . . . ,K} and ev-
ery sentiment polarity level y ? {?1, 0,+1},
we start by drawing a unigram language model
4The typical connective in this situation would be and
which is highly ambiguous and can signal several traditional
discourse relations.
from a Dirichlet prior. For example, the language
model of the aspect service may indicate that the
word friendly is used to express a positive opinion,
whereas the word rude expresses a negative one.
Similarly, for every topic z and every over-
all sentiment polarity y?, we draw a distribution
?y?,z over opinion polarity in this topic z. Intu-
itively, one would expect the sentiment of an as-
pect to more often agree with the overall sentiment
y? than not. This intuition is encoded in an asym-
metric Dirichlet prior Dir(? y?) for ?y?,z : ? y? =
(?y?,1, . . . , ?y?,M ), ?y?,y = ? + ??y,y?, where ?y,y? is
the Kronecker symbol, ? and ? are nonnegative
scalar parameters. Using these ?heavy-diagonal?
priors is crucial, as this is the way to ensure that
the overall sentiment level is tied to the aspect-
specific sentiment level. Otherwise, sentiment lev-
els will be specific to individual aspects (e.g., the
?+1? sentiment for one topic may correspond to
a ?-1? sentiment for another one). Without this
property we would not be able to encode soft con-
straints imposed by the discourse relations.
Drawing documents On the document level, as
in the standard LDA model, we choose the distri-
bution over topics for the document from a sym-
metric Dirichlet prior parametrized by ?, which is
used to control sparsity of topic assignments. Fur-
thermore, we draw the global sentiment y?d from a
uniform distribution.
The generation of a document is done on the
EDU-by-EDU basis. In this work, we assume
that EDU segmentation is provided by the prepro-
cessing step. First, we generate the aspect zd,s
for EDU s according to the distribution of top-
ics ?d. Then, we choose a sentiment level yd,s
for the considered EDU from the categorical dis-
tribution ?y?d,zd,s , conditioned on the aspect zd,s,
as well as on the global sentiment of the document
y?d. Finally, we generate the bag of words for the
EDU by drawing the words from the aspect- and
sentiment-specific language model.
This model can be seen as a variant of a state-of-
the-art model for jointly inducing sentiment and
aspect at the sentence level (Jo and Oh, 2011), or,
more precisely, as its combination with the JST
model (Lin and He, 2009), adapted to the specifics
of our setting. Both these models have been shown
to perform well on sentiment and topic prediction
tasks, outperforming earlier models, such as the
TSM model (Mei et al, 2007). Consequently, it
can be considered as a strong baseline.1632
3.2 Discourse-informed model
In order to integrate discourse information into the
discourse-agnostic model, we need to define a set
of extra parameters and random variables.
Drawing model parameters First, at the corpus
level, we draw a distribution ?? over four discourse
relations: three relations as defined in Table 1 and
an additional dummy relation 4 to indicate that
there is no relation between two adjacent EDUs
(NoRelation). This distribution is drawn from an
asymmetric Dirichlet prior parametrized by a vec-
tor of hyperparameters ?. These parameters en-
code the intuition that most pairs of EDUs do not
exhibit a discourse relation relevant for the task
(i.e. favor NoRelation), that is ?4 has a distinct
and larger value than other parameters ?4?.
Every discourse relation c (including
NoRelation which is treated here as Same-
Same) is associated with two groups of transition
distributions, one governing transitions of sen-
timent (??c) and another one controlling topic
transitions (??c). The parameter ??c,ys , defines a
distribution over sentiment polarity for the EDU
s+ 1 given the sentiment for the sth EDU ys and
the discourse relation c. This distribution encodes
our beliefs about sentiment transitions between
EDUs s and s+ 1 related through c. For example,
the distribution ??SameAlt,+1 would assign higher
probability mass to the positive sentiment polarity
(+1) than to the other 2 sentiment levels (0,
-1). Similarly, the parameter ??c,zs , defines a
distribution over K aspects.
These two families of transition distributions
are each defined in the following way. For the dis-
tribution ??, for relations that favor changing the
aspect (SameAlt and AltAlt), the probability of the
preferred (K-1) transitions is proportional to ??
and for the remaining transitions it is proportional
to 1. On the other hand, for the relations that fa-
vor keeping the same aspect (NoRelation and Alt-
Same), the probability of the preferred transition is
proportional to ???, whereas the probability of the
(K-1) remaining transitions is again proportional
to 1. For the sentiment transitions, the distribution
??c,ys is defined in the analogous way (but depends
on ?? and ???). These scalars are hand-coded and
define soft constraints that discourse relations im-
pose on the local flow of sentiment and aspects.
The parameter ??c is a language model over dis-
course cues w?, which are not restricted to uni-
grams but can generate phrases of arbitrary (and
variable) size. For this reason, we draw them
from a Dirichlet process (DP) (i.e. one for each
discourse relation, except for NoRelation). The
base measure G0 provides the probability of an n-
word sequence calculated with the bigram prob-
ability model estimated from the corpus.5 This
model component bears strong similarities to the
Bayesian model of word segmentation (Goldwa-
ter et al, 2009), though we use the DP process
to generate only the prefix of the EDU, whereas
the rest of the EDU is generated from the bag-of-
words model.
Drawing documents As pointed out above, the
content generation is broken into two steps, where
first we draw the discourse cue w?d,s from ??c and
then we generate the remaining words.
The second difference at the data generation
step (Figure 1) is in the way the aspect and sen-
timent labels are drawn. As the discourse rela-
tion between the EDUs has already been chosen,
we have some expectations about the values of the
sentiment and aspect of the following EDU, which
are encoded by the distributions ?? and ??. These
are only soft constraints that have to be taken into
consideration along with the information provided
by the aspect-sentiment model. This coupling of
information naturally translates into the product-
of-experts (PoE) (Hinton, 1999) approach, where
two sources of information jointly contribute to
the final result. The PoE model seems to be more
appropriate here than a mixture model, as we do
not want the discourse transition to overpower the
sentiment-topic model. In the PoE model, in or-
der for an outcome to be chosen, it needs to have
a non-negligible probability under both models.
4 Inference
Since exact inference of our model is intractable,
we use collapsed Gibbs sampling. The variables
that need to be inferred are the topic assignments
z, the sentiment assignments y, the discourse re-
lations c and the discourse cue w? (or, more pre-
cisely, its length) and are all sampled jointly (for
each EDU) since we expect them to be highly de-
pendent. All other variables (i.e. unknown dis-
tributions) could be marginalized out to obtain a
collapsed Gibbs sampler (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004).
5This measure is improper but it serves the purpose of
favoring long cues, the behavior arguably desirable for our
application.1633

The components responsible for modeling dis-
course information are emphasized in red: when
dropped, one is left with the discourse-agnostic
model.
Unfortunately, the use of the PoE model pre-
vents us from marginalizing the parameters ex-
actly. Instead, as in Naseem et al (2009), we re-
sort to an approximation. We assume that zd,s and
yd,s are drawn twice; once from the document spe-
cific distribution and once from the discourse tran-
sition distributions. Under this simplification, we
can easily derive the conditional probabilities for
the collapsed Gibbs sampling.
5 Experiments
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that aims at evaluating directly the joint informa-
tion of the sentiment and aspect assignment at the
sub-sentential level of full reviews; most existing
studies either focus on indirect evaluation of the
produced models (e.g., classifying the overall sen-
timent of sentences (Titov and McDonald, 2008a;
Brody and Elhadad, 2010) or even reviews (Naka-
gawa et al, 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011)) or evaluated
solely at the sentential or even document level.
Consequently, in order to evaluate our methods,
we created a new dataset which will be publicly
released.

Table 2: Distribution of aspects in the data.
Dataset and Annotation The dataset we created
consists of 13559 hotel reviews from TripAdvi-
sor.com.6 Since our modeling is performed on the
EDU level, all sentences where segmented using
the SLSEG software package.7 As a result, our
dataset consists of 322,935 EDUs.
For creating the gold standard, 9 annotators an-
notated a random subset of our dataset (65 re-
views, 1541 EDUs). The annotators were pre-
sented with the whole review partitioned in EDUs
and were asked to annotate every EDU with the
aspect and sentiment (i.e. +1, 0 or ?1) it ex-
presses. Table 2 presents the distribution of as-
pects in the dataset. The distribution of the sen-
timents is uniform. The label rest captures cases
where EDUs do not refer to any aspect or to a very
rare aspect. The inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
as measured in terms of Cohen?s kappa score, was
66% for the aspect labeling, 70% for the sentiment
annotation and 61% for the joint task of sentiment
and aspect annotation. Though these scores may
not seem very high, they are similar to the ones re-
ported in related sentiment annotation efforts (see
e.g., Ganu et al (2009)).
Experimental setup In order to quantitatively
evaluate the model predictions, we run two sets of
experiments. In the first, we treat the task as an un-
supervised classification problem and evaluate the
output of the models directly against the gold stan-
dard annotation. This is a very challenging set-up,
as the model has no prior information about the
aspects defined (Table 2). In the second set of
experiments, we show that aspects and sentiments
induced by our model can be used to construct in-
formative features for supervised classification. In

all the cases, we compare the discourse-agnostic
and the discourse-informed models.
In order to induce the model, we let the sampler
run for 2000 iterations. We use the last sample to
define the labeling. The number of topics K was
set to 10 in order to match the number of aspects
defined in our annotation scheme (see Table 2).
The hyperpriors were chosen in a qualitative ex-
periment over a subset of our dataset by manually
inspecting the produced languages models. The
resulting values are: ? = 10?3, ? = 5 ? 10?4,
? = 5 ? 10?4, ? = 10?3, ?4 = 103, ?4? = 10?4,
?? = 85 and ??? = ?? = ??? = 5.
5.1 Direct clustering evaluation
Our labels encoding aspect and sentiment level can
be regarded as clusters. Consequently we can ap-
ply techniques developed in the context of cluster-
ing evaluation. We use a version of the standard
metrics considered for the word sense induction
task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) where a clustering
is converted to a classification problem. This is
achieved by splitting the gold standard into two
subsets; the training portion is used to choose one-
to-one correspondence from the gold classes to the
induced clusters and then the chosen mapping is
applied to the testing portion. We perform 10-fold
cross validation and report precision, recall and F1
score. Our dataset is very skewed and the majority
class (rest) is arguably the least important, so we
use macro-averaging over labels and then average
those across folds to arrive to the reported num-
bers. We compare the discourse-informed model
(Discourse) against two baselines; the discourse-
agnostic SentAsp model and Random which as-
signs a random label to an EDU while respecting
the distribution of labels in the training set.
Table 3 presents the first analysis conducted on
the full set of EDUs. We observe that by incor-
porating latent discourse relation we improve per-

formance over the discourse-agnostic model Sen-
tAsp (statistically significant according to paired t-
test with p < 0.01). Note that fairly low scores in
this evaluation setting are expected for any unsu-
pervised model of sentiment and topics, as models
are unsupervised both in the aspect-specific senti-
ment and in topic labels and the total number of
labels is 28 (all aspects can be associated with the
3 sentiment levels except for rest which can only
be used with neutral (0) sentiment). Consequently,
induced topics, though informative (as we confirm
in Section 5.3), may not correspond to the topics
defined in the gold standard. For example, one
well-known property of LDA-style topic models
is their tendency to induce topics which account
for similar fraction of words in the dataset (Jagar-
lamudi et al, 2012), thus, over-splitting ?heavy?
topics (e.g. rooms in our case). The same, though
to lesser degree, is true for sentiment levels where
the border between neutral and positive (or nega-
tive) is also vaguely defined.
To gain insight into our model, we conducted
an experiment similar to the one presented in So-
masundaran et al (2009). We divide the dataset in
two subsets; one containing all EDUs starting with
a discourse cue (?marked?) and one containing the
remaining EDUs (?unmarked?). We hypothesize
that the effect of the discourse-aware model should
be stronger on the first subset, since the presence
of the connective indicates the possibility of a dis-
course relation with the previous EDU. The set of
discourse connectives is taken from the Penn Dis-
course Treebank (Prasad et al, 2008), thus creat-
ing a list of 240 potential connectives.
Table 5 presents a subset of ?marked? EDUs for
which trying to assign the sentiment and aspect
out of context (i.e. without the previous EDU) is
a difficult task. In examples 1-3 there is no ex-
plicit mention of the aspect. However, there is
an anaphoric expression (marked in bold) which1635
refers to a mention of the aspect in some previous
EDU. On the other hand, in examples 4 and 5 there
is an ambiguity in the choice of aspect; in example
5, tea making facilities can refer to a breakfast at
the hotel (label food) or to facilities in the room
(label rooms). Finally, examples 6-8 are too short
and not informative at all which indicates that the
segmentation tool does not always predict a de-
sirable segmentation. Consequently, automatic in-
duction of segmentation may be a better option.
Table 4 presents quantitative results of this anal-
ysis. Although the performance over the ?un-
marked? example is the same for the two mod-
els, this is not the case for the ?marked? instances
where the discourse-informed model leverages the
discourse signal and achieves better performance.
This behavior agrees with our initial hypothesis,
and suggests that our discourse representation,
though application-specific, relies in part on the
information encoded in linguistically-defined dis-
course cues. We will confirm this intuition in the
qualitative evaluation section. The increase for the
?marked? EDUs does not translate into greater dif-
ferences for the overall scores (Table 3) as marked
relations are considerably less frequent than un-
marked ones in our gold standard (i.e. 35% of the
EDUs are ?marked?). Nevertheless, this clearly
suggests that the discourse-informed model is in
fact capable of exploiting discourse signal.
5.2 Qualitative analysis
To investigate the quality of the induced discourse
structure, we present the most frequent discourse
cues extracted for every discourse relation. Ta-
ble 6 presents a selection of cues that best explain
the discourse relation they have been associated
with. A general observation is that among the cues
there are not only ?traditional? discourse connec-
tives like even though, although, and, but also cues
that are discriminative for the specific application.
In relation SameAlt we can mostly observe
phrases that tend to introduce a new aspect, since
an explicit mention of it is provided (e.g the loca-
tion is, the room was) and more specific phrases
like in addition are used to introduce a new aspect
with the same sentiment. However, these cues re-
veal important information about the aspect of the
EDU, and since they are associated with the lan-
guage model ??, they are not visible anymore to
the language model of aspects ?.

pect that since there is an anaphoric expression,
explicit lexical features for the aspect will be miss-
ing, making thus the decision concerning aspect
assignment ambiguous for any discourse-agnostic
model. Interestingly, we found the expressions un-
fortunately, fortunately, the only thing in the same
relation, since all indicate a change in sentiment.
Finally, AltAlt can be viewed as a mixture of the
other two relations. Furthermore, for this relation
we can find expressions that tend to be used at the
end of a review, since at this point we normally
change the aspect and often even sentiment. Some
examples of these cases are overall, we will defi-
nitely and even the misspelled version of the latter
i would definately.
5.3 Features in supervised learning
As an additional experiment to demonstrate infor-
mative of the output of the two models, we de-
sign a supervised learning task of predicting sen-
timent and topic of EDUs. In this setting, the
feature vector of every EDU consists of its bag-
of-word-representation to which we add two extra
features; the models? predictions of topic and sen-
timent. We train a support vector machine with a
polynomial kernel using the default parameters of
Weka8 and perform 10-fold cross-validation.
Table 7 presents results of this analysis in terms
of accuracy for four classification tasks, i.e. pre-
dicting both sentiment and topic, only sentiment
and only topic for all EDUs, as well as predict-
ing sentiment and topic for the ?marked? dataset.
First, we observe that incorporation of the topic-

model features on a unigram-only model results
in an improvement in classification performance
across all tasks (predicting sentiment, predicting
aspects, or both); as a matter of fact, our accu-
racy results for predicting sentiment are compa-
rable to the sentence-level results presented by
Ta?ckstro?m and McDonald (2011). We have to
stress that accuracies for the joint task (i.e. pre-
dicting both sentiment and topic) are expected to
be lower since it can also be seen as the product
of the two other tasks (i.e. predicting only senti-
ment and only topic). We also observe that the fea-
tures induced from the Discourse model result in
higher accuracy than the ones from the discourse-
agnostic model SentAsp both in the complete set
of EDUs and the ?marked? subset, results that are
in line with the ones presented in Table 4. Fi-
nally, the fact that the results for the complete set
of EDUs are higher than the ones for the ?marked?
dataset clearly suggests that the latter constitute a
hard case for sentiment analysis, in which exploit-
ing discourse signal proves to be beneficial.
6 Related Work
Recently, there has been significant interest in
leveraging content structure for a number of NLP
tasks (Webber et al, 2011). Sentiment analysis
has not been an exception to this and discourse has
been used in order to enforce constraints on the
assignment of polarity labels at several granular-
ity levels, ranging from the lexical level (Polanyi
and Zaenen, 2006) to the review level (Taboada
et al, 2011). One way to deal with this prob-
lem is to model the interactions by using a pre-
compiled set of polarity shifters (Nakagawa et al,
2010; Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006; Sadamitsu et al,
2008). Socher et al (2011) defined a recurrent
neural network model, which, in essence, learns
those polarity shifters relying on sentence-level
sentiment labels. Though successful, this model is
unlikely to capture intra-sentence non-local phe-
nomena such as effect of discourse connectives,
unless it is provided with syntactic information
as an input. This may be problematic for the
noisy sentiment-analysis domain and especially
for poor-resource languages. Similar to our work,
others have focused on modeling interactions be-
tween phrases and sentences. However, this has
been achieved by either using a subset of relations
that can be found in discourse theories (Zhou et
al., 2011; Asher et al, 2008; Snyder and Barzi-
lay, 2007) or by using directly (Taboada et al,
2008) the output of discourse parsers (Soricut and
Marcu, 2003). Discourse cues as predictive fea-
tures of topic boundaries have also been consid-
ered in Eisenstein and Barzilay (2008). This work
was extended by Trivedi and Eisenstein (2013),
where discourse connectors are used as features
for modeling subjectivity transitions.
Another related line of research was presented
in Somasundaran et al (2009) where a domain-
specific discourse scheme is considered. Simi-
larly to our set-up, discourse relations enforce con-
straints on sentiment polarity of associated sen-
timent expressions. Somasundaran et al (2009)
show that gold-standard discourse information en-
coded in this way provides a useful signal for pre-
diction of sentiment, but they leave automatic dis-
course relation prediction for future work. They
use an integer linear programming framework to
enforce agreement between classifiers and soft
constraints provided by discourse annotations.
This contrasts with our work; we do not rely on
expert discourse annotation, but rather induce both
discourse relations and cues jointly with aspect
and sentiment.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
In this work, we showed that by jointly induc-
ing discourse information in the form of discourse
cues, we can achieve better predictions for aspect-
specific sentiment polarity. Our contribution con-
sists in proposing a general way of how discourse
information can be integrated in any LDA-style
discourse-agnostic model of aspect and sentiment.
In the future, we aim at modeling more flexible
sets of discourse relations and automatically in-
ducing discourse segmentation relevant to the task.
