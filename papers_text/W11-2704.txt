Abstract
Currently there is little agreement about, or
even discussion of, methodologies for task-
based evaluation of NLG systems. I discuss
one specific issue in this area, namely the im-
portance of control vs the importance of eco-
logical validity (real-world context), and sug-
gest that perhaps we need to put more empha-
sis on ecological validity in NLG evaluations.
1 Introduction
Task-based extrinsic evaluation of a Natural Lan-
guage Generation (NLG) system involves measuring
the impact of an NLG system on how well subjects
perform a task. It is usually regarded as the ?gold
standard? for NLG evaluation, and it is the only type
of evaluation which will be seriously considered by
many external user communities.
Despite the importance of task-based evaluations,
however, there is surprisingly little discussion (or
agreement) in the NLG community about how these
should be carried out. In recent years there has been
a fair amount of discussion about the appropriate
use of corpus-based metrics, and there seems (de
facto) to be some level of agreement about evalua-
tions based on opinions of human subjects. But there
is little discussion and much diversity in task-based
evaluation methodology.
In this paper I focus on one one specific method-
ological issue, which is the relative importance of
control and ecological validity (real-world context).
An ideal task-based evaluation would be controlled,
that is the impact of NLG texts would be compared
against the impact of controlled or baseline texts in
a manner which minimises confounding factors. It
would also be ecologically valid, that is the eval-
uation would be carried out by representative real-
world users in a real-world context while performing
real-world tasks. Unfortunately, because of prag-
matic constraints including time, money, and ethical
approval, it is not always possible to achieve both of
these goals. So which is more important?
The methodologies currently used for task-based
evaluation in NLG largely derive from the Human-
Computer Interaction community, which in turn are
largely based on methodologies for experiments in
cognitive psychology. Now, psychologists place
much more emphasis on control than on ecologi-
cal validity; they regard control as absolutely es-
sential, but (with some exceptions) they see little
wrong with conducting experiments on unrepresen-
tative subjects (undergraduates) in artificial contexts
(psychology labs). Indeed many psychologists are
now embracing web-based experiments, where they
do not even know who the subjects are and what con-
texts they are working in. For the research goals of
psychologists, this probably makes sense. But the
research goals of the NLG community are different
from the research goals of the psychological com-
munity; should we place more emphasis on ecologi-
cal validity than they do, and less on control?
My own opinions on this matter are changing.
Five years ago, I would have echoed the feeling that
control is all-important. Now, though, I am begin-
ning to think that in order to achieve both NLG?s
scientific goals (understanding language and com-
putation) and NLG?s technological goals (developing
28
useful real-world technology), we need to put more
emphasis on ecological validity in our evaluations.
2 Evaluation which is both controlled and
in real-world context: STOP and DIAG
An ideal evaluation is one which is both controlled
and done in a real-world context. An example is the
evaluation of the STOP system. which generated tai-
lored smoking-cessation advice based on the user?s
response to a questionnaire (Lennox et al, 2001; Re-
iter et al, 2003). The STOP project was a collabora-
tion with medical colleagues, and the STOP evalua-
tion (which was designed by the medics) was car-
ried out as a randomised controlled clinical trial. We
recruited 2500 smokers, and sent one-third of them
STOP letters, one-third a non-tailored (canned) let-
ter, and one-third a letter which just thanked them
for being in out study. After 6 months we asked
participants if they had stopped smoking; we tested
saliva samples from people who said they had quit
in order to verify their smoking status. The result
of this evaluation was that the STOP tailored letters
were no more effective than the control non-tailored
letter. The STOP evaluation cost about UK?75,000,
and took about 20 months to design, organise, and
carry out.
The STOP evaluation was carried out in a real-
world context; the letters were sent to actual smok-
ers, and we measured whether they quit smoking. It
was also controlled, since the impact of STOP letters
was compared to the impact of non-tailored letters.
However there was a lot of ?noise? (in the statistical
sense) in the STOP evaluation, because different peo-
ple (with different personalities, attitudes towards
smoking, personal circumstances, etc) received the
tailored and non-tailored letters, and this impacted
smoking-cessation rates in the the three groups.
Another evaluation which was controlled and was
done at least partially in a real-world context was the
evaluation of the DIAG-NLP intelligent tutoring sys-
tem (di Eugenio et al, 2005). In this experiment, 75
students (the appropriate subject group for this tu-
toring system) were divided into three groups: two
groups interacted with two versions of the DIAG-
NLP system, and a third interacted with a control
version of DIAG which did not include any NLG. Ef-
fectiveness was measured by learning gain (change
in knowledge, measured by differences in scores in
a pre-test and post-test), which is standard in the tu-
toring system domain. The evaluation showed that
students learned more from the second (more ad-
vanced) version of the DIAG-NLP system than from
the non-NLG version of DIAG.
The DIAG-NLP evaluation was controlled, and it
was real-world in the sense that it used represen-
tative subjects and measured real-world outcome.
However, it appears (the paper is not completely ex-
plicit about this) that the evaluation assessed learn-
ing about a topic (fixing a home heating system)
which was not part of the student?s normal curricu-
lum; if this is the case, then the evaluation was not
100% in a real-world context.
3 Evaluation which is controlled but not
real-world: BT-45 and Young (1999)
The Babytalk project (Gatt et al, 2009) developed
several NLG systems which summarised clinical data
from babies in neonatal intensive care (NICU), for
different audiences and purposes; one of these sys-
tems, BT45 (Portet et al, 2009), summarised 45
minutes of data for doctors and nurses, to support
immediate decision-making. Babytalk was a collab-
orative project with clinical staff and psychologists,
and the psychologists designed the BT45 evaluation
(van der Meulen et al, 2010).
We picked 24 data sets (scenarios) based on his-
torical data from babies who had been in NICU
5 years previously, and for each data set cre-
ated three presentations: visualisation, computer-
generated text, and human-written text. For each
data set, we also asked expert consultants what ac-
tions should be taken by medical staff. We then
asked 35 medical staff (doctors and nurses of var-
ied expertise levels) to look at the scenarios using a
mix of presentations, in a Latin Square design; eg,
1/3 of the subjects saw the visualisation of scenario
1 data, 1/3 saw the computer-generated summary
of scenario 1 data, and 1/3 saw the human-written
summary of this data. Also each subject saw the
same number of scenarios in each condition, this re-
duced the impact of individual differences between
subjects. Subjects were asked to make decisions
about appropriate medical actions (or say no action
should be taken), and responses were compared to
29
the ?gold standard? recommendations from the con-
sultants. The result was that decision performance
was best with the human-written summaries; there
was no significant difference between overall deci-
sion performance with the computer-generated sum-
maries and the visualisation (although at the level
of individual scenarios, computer texts were more
effective in some scenarios, and visualisations was
more effective in other scenarios). The BT45 evalua-
tion cost about UK?20,000, and took about 6 months
to design, organise, and carry out.
The BT45 evaluation was carefully controlled
However, it was not done in a real-world context.
Doctors and nurses sat in an experiment room (not
in the ward) and looked at data from babies they
did not remember (as opposed to babies whom they
knew well because they has been looking after them
for the past few weeks); they also did not visually
observe the babies, which is a very important infor-
mation source for NICU staff.
Many other task-based evaluations of NLG sys-
tems have been controlled but not done in a real-
world context, including the very first task-based
NLG evaluation I am aware of, by Young (1999).
Young developed four algorithms for generating in-
structional texts, and tested these by asking 26 stu-
dents to follow the instructions generated by the var-
ious algorithms on several scenarios, and measured
error rates in carrying out the instructions. The in-
structions involved carrying out actions on campus
(going to labs, playing in soccer matches, etc). The
students did not actually carry out these actions, in-
stead they interacted with a ?text-based virtual real-
ity system?. Hence the evaluation was controlled but
not carried out in real-world context.
4 Evaluation which is real-world but not
controlled: BT-Nurse
The next Babytalk system (after BT45) was BT-
NURSE; it generated summaries of 12-hours of clin-
ical data, to support nursing shift handover (Hunter
et al, 2011). We initially expected to evaluate BT-
NURSE using a similar methodology to the BT45
evaluation. However the medical people involved
in BabyTalk complained that it was unrealistic to
evaluate the system in an artificial controlled con-
text, where clinical staff were looking at data out of
context. So instead we evaluated BT-NURSE by in-
stalling the system in the NICU, so that nurses used
it to get information about babies they were actu-
ally caring for. The primary outcome measure was
subjective ratings by nurses as to the helpfulness of
BT-NURSE texts; and indeed most nurses thought the
texts were helpful.
The BT-NURSE evaluation was significantly more
expensive than the BT45 evaluation, because we
hired a full-time software engineer for a year to
ensure that the software was sufficiently well en-
gineered so that it could be deployed and used in
the hospital; we were also required by the medical
ethics committee to have a research nurse on-site
who checked texts for errors before they were shown
to the duty nurses, and removed them from the ex-
periment if they were factually incorrect and could
damage patient care (in fact this never happened, the
research nurse did not regard any of the BT-NURSE
texts as potentially harmful from this perspective).
All in all cost was probably about UK?50,000, and
the entire process (including the software engineer-
ing) took about 18 months.
The BT-NURSE evaluation was not controlled; we
did not compare the computer generated texts to
anything else, and indeed did not directly measure
any task outcome variable, instead we solicited opin-
ions as to utility. It was however ecologically valid,
since it was carried out by asking nurses (real-world
users) to use BT-NURSE for care planning (real-
world task) in a real-world context (on-ward, involv-
ing babies the nurses were familiar with and could
visually observe).
5 Discussion
Ideally a task-based evaluation should be both con-
trolled and ecologically valid (done in a real-world
context). But if it is not possible to achieve both
of these objectives, which is most important? Obvi-
ously in many cases the desires of collaborators need
to be considered; for example psychologists gener-
ally place much more emphasis on control than on
ecological validity, whereas many commercial or-
ganisation take the opposite perspective. But which
is more important from an NLG perspective?
From a pragmatic perspective, two important ar-
guments for focusing on control are cost and publi-
30
cations. The figures given above suggest that doing
an evaluation in a real-world context makes it sub-
stantially more expensive. Of course this is based
on very limited data, but I believe this is correct,
deploying a system in a real-world context requires
addressing engineering and ethical issues which are
expensive and time-consuming to resolve. From a
publications perspective; most NLG reviewers are
much more concerned about control than about eco-
logical validity. Especially in high-prestige venues,
reviewers are likely to complain about uncontrolled
evaluations, while making little (if any) mention of
concerns about lack of ecological validity.
For what its worth, my own view on this issue has
changed. If asked five years ago, I would have said
that control was more important, but now I am veer-
ing more towards ecological validity. The techno-
logical goal of NLG is to develop technology which
is used in real-world applications, and from this per-
spective if we do not evaluate in real-world contexts,
we risk being side-tracked into technology which
looks good in a controlled environment but is useless
in the real world. Similarly, if our goal is to develop
a better scientific understanding of computation and
language, I think we have to look at how language
is used in real-world contexts, which (at least in my
mind) is quite different from how language is used
in artificial contexts.
Plaisant (2004) made some related points in her
discussion of evaluation of information visualisa-
tion. She pointed out that controlled evaluations
of visualisation systems in artificial contexts might
be less informative than uncontrolled evaluations
in real-world contexts. She also pointed out that
controlled evaluations could not evaluate some of
the most important benefits of visualisation systems.
For example, sometimes the primary objective of vi-
sualisation systems is to support scientific discov-
ery, that is to make it easier for scientists who are
analysing data to come up with new insights and
hypotheses. However, testing effectiveness at sup-
porting scientific discovery in a controlled fashion
is almost impossible. Perhaps in theory one could
compare the ?productivity? of two groups of scien-
tists, one with and one without visualisation tools,
but the comparison would have to involve a large
number of scientists over a period of months or even
years, with scientists in one group not allowed to
communicate with scientists in the other group. It
is difficult to imagine that such an experiment could
in fact be carried out (or that it would be approved
by a research ethics committee). Plaisant argues that
focusing on controlled experiments means focusing
on things that are easily measurable in such experi-
ments, which may lead researchers to ignore the out-
comes that we really care about.
Another important point is that the goal of evalua-
tion is not just to assess if something works, but also
to come up with insights as to how to improve an
algorithm, module, or system. In NLG evaluations
such insights are often based on free-text comments
made by subjects, and in my experience better and
more insightful comments are obtained from evalu-
ations in real-world contexts.
An important potential caveat is that all of the ex-
amples cited above were system evaluations, which
attempted to assess how useful a system was from an
applied perspective. If the goal of an evaluation is to
test a scientific theory or model, should we always
(as psychologists do) favour control over ecological
validity? My own belief is that the psychologists are
missing important insights and findings by ignoring
ecological validity, and the most effective way for
the NLG community to ?add value? to the enterprise
of understanding language is not to imitate the psy-
chologists, but rather to use a different experimental
paradigm, which focuses much more on ecological
validity. But others will no doubt disagree.
6 Conclusion
It is difficult to choose between control and ecolog-
ical validity, because clearly both greatly contribute
to the usefulness of an evaluation. But this trade-
off must be made in many cases, and it would be
preferable for it to be explicitly discussed. And of
course there are many other desirable factors which
may need to be involved in a tradeoff; for example,
how important is it that subjects be representative of
the user community, instead of whoever is easiest
to recruit (eg, undergraduates). My hope is that the
NLG community can explicitly discuss such issues,
and come up with recommended evaluation method-
ologies for task-based studies, which are based the
scientific and technological objectives of our com-
munity.
