Abstract 
This paper proposes a unified evalua-
tion method for multiple reading sup-
port systems such as a sentence 
translation system and a word transla-
tion system.  In reading a non-native 
language text, these systems aim to 
lighten the reading burden.  When we 
evaluate the performance of these sys-
tems, we cannot rely solely on these 
tests, as the output forms are different.  
Therefore, we must assess the perform-
ance of these systems based on the us-
ers? reading comprehension and 
reading speed.  We will further support 
our findings with experimental results.  
They show that the reading-speed pro-
cedure is able to evaluate the support 
systems, as well as, the comprehension-
based procedure proposed by Ohguro 
(1993) and Fuji et al (2001). 
1 Introduction 
This paper presents an evaluation method for 
different reading support systems such as a sen-
tence-machine translation system (henceforth, 
an MT-system) and a word/phrase translation 
system (henceforth, a w/p-MT-system).  Al-
though, there are various manual/automatic 
evaluation methods for these systems, e.g., 
BLEU (Papineni et al 2002), these methods are 
basically incapable of dealing with an MT-
system and a w/p-MT-system at the same time, 
as they have different output forms.  On the con-
trary, there are further methods which examine 
the efficacy of these systems (Ohguro 1993; Fuji 
et al 2001).  These studies demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of the reading support systems by 
comparing reading comprehension test scores 
between an English-only text and the one with 
outputs of either an MT-system (Fuji et al 2001) 
or a w/p-MT-system (Ohguro 1993). 
In our evaluation method, we examined the 
system based not only con comprehension but 
also on speed, i.e., reading efficacy (Alderson 
2000).  If the system supports a user in an appro-
priate way, then the reading efficacy would in-
crease from the bottom line, i.e., text without any 
support.  The previous studies focused mainly on 
reading comprehension.  We will now broaden 
our examination to include reading speed. 
We are able to evaluate a system based on 
single sentences, as we measure sentence-
reading speed.  In contrast, we are unable to 
carry out such a local domain evaluation solely 
based on the comprehension performance. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
reviews the previous studies, which evaluated 
reading support systems based on the compre-
hension performance, i.e., Ohguro (1993) and 
Fuji et al (2001); Section 3 describes our 
evaluation method, which evaluates both an 
244
MT-system and a w/p-MT-system based on 
speed performance; Section 4 reports the ex-
perimental results.  Through the experiments, 
we confirmed that the speed performance-based 
evaluation basically parallels the comprehension 
performance-based evaluation; and finally Sec-
tion 5 presents our conclusions and future work. 
2 The Comprehension-based Methods 
2.1 Ohguro (1993) 
Ohguro (1993) carried out an experiment in 
which the efficacy of an English-Japanese w/p-
MT-system was examined and reported that a 
w/p-MT-system would be of more aid to those 
with a lower reading ability.  Fifty-four non-
native English speakers took part in the experi-
ment.  Ohguro (1993) prepared 28 texts with 80 
comprehension questions extracted from various 
Test of English for International Communication 
(TOEIC) texts. 
The experiment held two phases.  First, all 
the participants read 14 English-only texts and 
answered 40 comprehension questions.  On the 
basis of the test score, the participants were di-
vided into two groups so as to balance the read-
ing ability between them.  Then, Ohguro (1993) 
gave English-only texts to one group, the control 
group, and provided texts supported with the a 
w/p-MT-system to the other group. 
Ohguro (1993) hypothesized that the control 
group would get similar test scores on both tests, 
as opposed to varying test scores from the other 
group.  In addition, it was predicted that the 
scores of the non-control group would depend on 
the reading ability of the group members with 
respect to TOEIC scores (Hypothesis I).  That is, 
a higher test score would be expected for those 
with a lower TOEIC score group.  Thus, Hy-
pothesis I was incorrect given the results.  Oh-
guro (1993) reanalysed the increase in the test 
scores by dividing that group into two.  Under 
this revised analysis, he hypothesized that a 
greater increase in score would be shown in the 
second test by those with lower initial scores (the 
revised Hypothesis I).  This revised hypothesis 
was correct given the result.  Ohguro (1993) con-
cluded that the supporting effect of a w/p-MT-
system was greater for those who had a lower 
reading ability than those highly skilled readers. 
2.2 Fuji et al (2001) 
Fuji et al (2001) examined how the efficacy of 
an English-Japanese MT system varied depend-
ing on English reading ability.  Approximately 
200 non-native English speakers participated in 
the experiment.  The participants were divided 
into 12 groups based on their TOEIC scores.  
The score range was between (i) less than 395 
and (ii) more than 900.  Fuji et al (2001) pre-
pared three types of texts.  One was an English-
only text as a control text, another contained 
only translated sentences by an MT-system, 
and the other involved both English texts and 
the MT-system outputs.  Each participant read 
14 texts, and answered 40 comprehension ques-
tions. 
Through this experiment, Fuji et al (2001) 
observed that translation-only texts would de-
grade the test scores for the higher TOEIC score 
group, while the lower score group exhibited no 
degrading effect.  In addition, they found that 
English texts with MT-outputs might increase 
the test scores for the lower score group more 
greatly than the higher score group. 
With respect to the test completion time, Fuji 
et al (2001) observed that an MT-system highly 
shortened the time for the lower score group 
relative to the higher score group. 
2.3 Summary 
Through the surveys of these studies, we were 
able to confirm that both a w/p-MT-system and 
an MT-system exhibited greater supporting ef-
fects on the lower TOEIC score group than the 
higher TOEIC score group. 
3 Evaluation with Reading Speed 
3.1 The purpose 
The purpose of our evaluation is to pursue the 
efficacy of reading support systems with respect 
not only to the users? reading ability but also to 
the readability of a complete text or a single sen-
tence.  That is, we would like to explicate 
through the evaluation whether the supporting 
effect might change due to the text properties 
such as complexity of a syntactic structure, fa-
miliarity of words, and so on. 
In order to depict such a local effect, we as-
sume that the comprehension-based evaluation 
245
would be inappropriate, as it is inefficient to 
assign a comprehension question to each sen-
tence.  Suppose that we could evaluate reading 
support systems regarding such a local domain.  
Then, we could choose which system is proper, 
depending on his/her reading ability and the 
readability of a text.  Such usage of reading sup-
port systems would be useful. 
3.2 Reading Speed as an Evaluation Criterion 
In our evaluation method, we adopt reading 
speed performance as an evaluation criterion in 
addition to the comprehension performance.  
There are three reasons for this adoption of read-
ing speed. 
First, in contrast to reading comprehension, 
we can measure sentence-reading speed, and 
thus we can examine system efficacy on a sen-
tence-level. 
Secondly, reading speed can be measured 
with any texts which is readable by the reading 
support systems.  For instance, we can evaluate 
system efficacy for texts such as newspapers, 
magazine articles, web pages, emails, and so on.  
By contrast, the comprehension-based evalua-
tion requires comprehension questions. 
Thirdly, as shown below, we have statisti-
cally found that the reading speed reflects the 
readability of a sentence.  We confirmed the 
positive correlation (r=0.7, p<0.01) between 
reading speed and readability of a text calculated 
with the so-called readability formula (Flesch 
1948).  Given this positive correlation, we as-
sumed that reading speed indicates readability.  
Thus, a direct relationship exists between read-
ability and reading speed. 
3.3 Reading Speed-based Evaluation 
Method 
Assuming that reading speed reflects text read-
ability, we can further assume that the reading 
support systems would affect text readability.  
That is, the positive supporting effect of a sys-
tem would increase the text readability.  Given 
this, we can evaluate the efficacy of a system on 
the basis of reading speed. 
Our evaluation method accepts the positive 
effect of a system if the reading speed is in-
creased.  When the reading speed remains in-
variant, or decreases, the method regards a 
system as inefficient.  Thus, if we compare the 
reading speed between a supported and a non-
supported text, the increase of speed should be 
greater for those who have a lower reading abil-
ity than the highly skilled people on the basis of 
previous studies. 
4 Evaluation Experiment 
4.1 The Experimental Purpose 
We conducted an experiment in order to exam-
ine the validity of our method.  Given the read-
ing speed evaluation method, it is predicted 
that reading speed would reflect readability of 
a text (Hypothesis 1) and reader?s ability (Hy-
pothesis 2). 
As for readability of a text, we assume that 
supporting systems would increase readability 
of a text.  Therefore, we set the following hy-
pothesis: 
 
Hypothesis 1: 
A non-supported English text would be the 
most difficult to read, whereas a manually 
translated Japanese text would be the easiest.  
Supported text would fall mid-range. 
 
The efficacy of the supporting systems is in-
versely related to the reader?s ability, as the pre-
vious studies have shown.  Therefore, we 
propose the following hypothesis: 
 
Hypothesis2: 
The inverse relation is detectable between the 
reading ability and the reading speed increase. 
 
4.2 The Experimental Design 
One hundred and two non-native English 
speakers participated in the experiment.  We 
divided the participants into three groups 
based on their TOEIC scores: (i) those with a 
lower score (400-595 pts.), (ii) those with an 
intermediate score (600-795 pts.); and (iii) 
those with a higher score (800-995 pts.).  The 
group sizes were: (i) = 36, (ii) = 36, and (iii) = 
30.  We statistically compared average test 
scores and reading speed among these groups. 
We prepared eighty-four texts out of our 
sourced TOEIC texts.  Each text consists of a 
passage and some comprehension questions.  
We added outputs of supporting systems to 
each text. 
246
In this experiment, we examined the effi-
cacy of the following supporting systems: a 
sentence translation system, a word/phrase 
translation system, and a chunker.  Thus, we 
created four types of test texts: (i) English 
texts glossed with sentence translations (here-
after, E&MT); (ii) machine-translated texts 
(MT); (iii) English texts glossed with word 
translation (RUB); and (iv) English texts with 
word/phrase boundary markers (CHU). 
In addition, we prepared two types of con-
trol texts.  One is a raw English text, and the 
other is a human-translated Japanese text.  We 
randomly selected sixteen texts from each text 
group and distributed eighty-four to each par-
ticipant.  Thus, the participants are exposed to 
a variety of texts. 
In the experiment we used a reading process 
monitoring tool and recorded the reading time 
per sentence (see Yoshimi et al 2005 for further 
description).  We calculated the sentence read-
ing speed based on words per minute (WPM) 
read.  As the cursor moves over each number 
bar, the text is displayed sentence-by-sentence.  
See Figure 1.  There is no limit to how many 
times a sentence can be viewed. 
 
 
Figure 1. Screenshot of the monitoring tool 
We omitted the machine-translated words 
and focused solely on the number of English 
words to calculate the reading speed.  Therefore, 
we were able to directly compare the reading 
speed of a supported text to that of a non-
supported English text. 
The goal of this study is to depict the effi-
cacy of the support systems.  Hence, the actual 
reading speed of an English and Japanese 
mixed text was out of the scope.  If reading 
speed was calculated based on both English 
and Japanese words, the reading speed of a 
supported text would be faster than an English 
text, even though the reading time was the 
same.  This is due to a greater number of words 
in the supported text.  Therefore, we calculated 
reading speed based solely on English words to 
account for this implausible effect.  We also 
applied this procedure to a manually translated 
Japanese text. 
4.3 Experimental Results 
4.3.1 Tested Data 
Before presenting the experimental results, 
one clarification is in order here.  We chose to 
analyse a manageable 13 reading texts of the 
whole data, i.e., 84 reading texts.  The texts 
we used varied in topic, style, and length.  For 
instance, they were article-based texts, reports, 
and advertisements.  Among these texts, we 
examined article type texts. 
There were two reasons for this limitation.  
One concern was with the performance of the 
reading support systems.  We assumed that the 
system performance was dependant on text 
styles, and that the system would most effec-
tively support reading of article type texts be-
cause they contained less stylistic variations 
compared with other types of texts, particu-
larly, advertisements. 
The other concern was with text length.  
Article type texts tended to be longer than the 
others, and hence were more conducive to the 
supporting effect of the systems as shown in 
Table 1.

Article texts 142.9 9.6

4.3.2 Testing Hypothesis 1: Reading Speed 
We are able to conclude in Hypothesis 1 that 
the reading speed of a supported text is slower 
than that of a non-supported English text.  See 
Table 2.  Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect 
with respect to the slowest speeds.  However, in 
regards to the fastest reading speed, Hypothesis 
1 was supported.

4.3.3 Testing Hypothesis 1: Comprehension 
Hypothesis 1 was not supported for the lowest 
comprehension scores, paralleling reading 
speed results.  Thus, the lowest score was 
found in the MT texts as shown in Table 3.  
The results supported the hypothesis in respect 
to the JPN texts scoring highest.

Table 3. Mean percentatge of questions answered correctly. 
In order to analyse the reading data in more 
detail, we compared the correct answer rates 
among the TOEIC test score groups.  We di-
vided the participants into three groups based on 
TOEIC scores: 400-595 (BEGinner), 600-795 
(INTermediate), and 800-995 (ADVanced). 
The correct answer rate of each group is 
shown in Table 4.  In the BEG class, the lowest 
rate was found in English texts, and the highest 
was seen in Japanese texts.  Although the high-
est rate can be seen in Japanese texts, the lowest 
was found in MT texts in the INT class and 
ADV class. 
On the basis of comprehension test results, 
we confirmed that all the supporting systems 
increased comprehension test scores for the 
BEG class, E&MT for the INT class, but not for 
the ADV class.

E&MT 0.87 0.93 0.91 
JPN 0.87 0.96 0.94 
Table 4. The correct answer rate by TOEIC score group 
On the basis of this result, we conclude that 
the reading support systems help the lowest 
TOEIC score group participants, while the sup-
porting effect would be minor for the higher 
score group. 
We analysed the mean rate with one-way 
ANOVA by contrasting the ENG texts or the JPN 
texts.  The result is shown in Table 5.  The asterisk 
refers to a non-significant difference, while the 
check mark shows a significant difference. 
In the BEG class, the rate of correct answers 
in the ENG texts was significantly lower than in 
the E&MT texts.  There was no text that signifi-
cantly differed from the JPN texts. 
In the INT class, there was no significant dif-
ference compared with the ENG texts, while the 
rate of the JPN texts significantly differed from 
the CHU, RUB, and MT texts. 
In the ADV class, there was no significant 
difference comparing with the ENG texts.  The 
rate of the JPN texts showed a significant differ-
ence from the MT texts.

4.3.4 Testing Hypothesis 2 
We found variances in the Hypothesis 1.  
Thus, the most readable text was the JPN texts, 
whereas the least readable text was not the ENG 
texts but the RUB texts(Table 3).  In addition, 
the other supported texts, the CHU, RUB, and 
E&MT texts were less readable than the non-
supported ENG texts.  However, the MT texts 
were more readable than the ENG texts.  There-
248
fore, we were able to conclude that Hypothesis 1 
was supported among the ENG, MT, and JPN 
texts. 
Given this, we focused on these texts and 
found that Hypotheses 2 was correct.  As Table 
6 shows, the reading speed of the MT texts was 
faster than the ENG texts in all the groups.  The 
increase of the speed was inversely related to the 
readers? ability.  Thus, the increase was 47.3 in 
the BEG class; 25.4 in the INT class; and 10.9 in 
the ADV class.

the ADV class, there was no text that signifi-
cantly deferred from the ENG texts.  The reading 
speed of the JPN texts was significantly faster

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented the reading speed-
based evaluation method for reading support 
systems.  On the basis of the experiment, we 
found that the method articulated the perform-
ance of the systems, such as a chunker, a word-
translation system, and a sentence-translation 
system.  We found that only a sentence-
translation showed the supporting effect.  How-
ever, this supporting effect was not available for 
the advanced English learners. 
We have not yet discussed crossing effects of 
comprehension result and speed result, but we 
will expect the further study would reveal it.
