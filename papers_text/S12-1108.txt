Abstract 
In this paper, we present our system descrip-
tion in task of Cross-lingual Textual Entail-
ment. The goal of this task is to detect 
entailment relations between two sentences 
written in different languages. To accomplish 
this goal, we first translate sentences written 
in foreign languages into English. Then, we 
use EDITS1, an open source package, to rec-
ognize entailment relations. Since EDITS only 
draws monodirectional relations while the task 
requires bidirectional prediction, thus we ex-
change the hypothesis and test to detect en-
tailment in another direction. Experimental 
results show that our method achieves promis-
ing results but not perfect results compared to 
other participants. 
1 Introduction 
In Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task (CLTE) 
of 2012, the organizers hold a task for Cross-
Lingual Textual Entailment. The Cross-Lingual 
Textual Entailment task addresses textual entail-
ment (TE) recognition under a new dimension 
(cross-linguality), and within a new challenging 
application scenario (content synchronization) 
Readers can refer to M. Negri et al 2012.s., for 
more detailed introduction. 1 
Textual entailment, on the other hand, recog-
nize, generate, or extract pairs of natural language 
expressions, and infer that if one element is true, 
whether the other element is also true. Several 
methods are proposed by previous researchers. 
There have been some workshops on textual en-
tailment in recent years. The recognizing textual 
entailment challenges (Bar-Haim et al 2006; 
Giampiccolo, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan, 2007; 
Giampiccolo, Dang, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan, 
2008), currently in the 7th year, provide additional 
significant thrust. Consequently, there are a large 
number of published articles, proposed methods, 
and resources related to textual entailment. A spe-
cial issue on textual entailment was also recently 
published, and its editorial provides a brief over-
view of textual entailment methods (Dagan, Dolan, 
Magnini, & Roth, 2009).  
Textual entailment recognizers judge whether 
or not two given language expressions constitute a 
correct textual entailment pair. Different methods 
may operate at different levels of representation of 
the input expressions. For example, they may treat 
the input expressions simply as surface strings, 
they may operate on syntactic or semantic repre-
sentations of the input expressions, or on represen-
tations combining information from different

levels. Logic-based approach is to map the lan-
guage expressions to logical meaning representa-
tions, and then rely on logical entailment checks, 
possibly by invoking theorem provers (Rinaldi et 
al., 2003; Bos & Markert, 2005; Tatu & Moldovan, 
2005, 2007). An alternative to use logical meaning 
representations is to start by mapping each word of 
the input language expressions to a vector that 
shows how strongly the word co-occurs with par-
ticular other words in corpora (Lin, 1998b), possi-
bly also taking into account syntactic information, 
for example requiring that the co-occurring words 
participate in particular syntactic dependencies 
(Pad?o & Lapata, 2007). Several textual entailment 
recognizing methods operate directly on the input 
surface strings. For example, they compute the 
string edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) of the two 
input strings, the number of their common words, 
or combinations of several string similarity 
measures (Malakasiotis & Androutsopoulos, 2007). 
Dependency grammar parsers (Melcuk, 1987; Ku-
bler, McDonald, & Nivre, 2009) are popular in 
textual entailment research. However, cross-lingual 
textual entailment brings some problems on past 
algorithms. On the other hand, many methods can?t 
be applied to it directly.  
In this paper, we propose a translation based 
method for cross-lingual textual entailment, which 
has been described in Mehdad et al 2010. First, we 
translate one part of the text, which termed as ?t1? 
and written in one language, into English, which 
termed as ?t2?. Then, we use EDITS, an open 
source package, to recognize entailment relations 
between two parts. Large-scale experiments are 
conducted on four language pairs, French-English, 
Spanish-English, Italian-English and German-
English. Although our method achieves promising 
results reported by organizers, it is still far from 
perfect compared to other participants. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. We describe our system framework in 
section 2. We report experimental results in section 
3 and draw our conclusions in the last section. 
2 System Description 
Figure 1 illustrates the overall framework of our 
system, where a machine translation model is em-
ployed to translate foreign language into English, 
since original EDITS could only deal with the text 
in the same language pairs.  
   In the following of this section, we will de-
scribe the translation module and configuration of 
EDITS in details. 
 
Figure 1:  The framework of our system. 
 
2.1 Machine Translation 
Recently, machine translation has attracted inten-
sive attention and has been well studied in natural 
language community. Effective models, such as 
Phrase-Based model (Koehn et al, 2003), Hierar-
chical Phrase-Based model (HPB) (Chiang, 2005), 
and Syntax-Based (Liu et al, 2006) model have 
been proposed to improve the translation quality. 
However, since current translation models require 
parallel corpus to extract translation rules, while 
parallel corpus on some language pairs such as 
Italian-English and Spanish-English are hard to 
obtain, therefore, we could use Google Translation 
Toolkit (GTT) to generate translation. 
Specifically, WMT 2 released some bilingual 
corpus for training, thus we use some portion to 
train a French-English translation engine using 
hierarchical phrase-based model. We also exploit 
system combination technique (A Rosti et al, 2007) 
to improve translation quality via blending the 
translation of our models and GTT?s. It is worth 
noting that GTT only gives 1-best translation, thus 
we duplicate 50 times to generate 50-best for sys-
tem combination.

2.2 Textual Entailment 
Many methods have been proposed to recognize 
textual entailment relations between two expres-
sions written in the same language. Since edit dis-
tance algorithms are effective on this task, we 
choose this method. And we use popular toolkit, 
EDITS, to accomplish the textual entailment task. 
EDITS is an open source software, which is 
used for recognizing entailment relations between 
two parts of text, termed as ?T? and ?H?. The sys-
tem is based on the edit distance algorithms, and 
computes the ?T?-?H? distance as the cost of the 
edit operations (i.e. insertion, deletion and substitu-
tion) that are necessary to transform ?T? into ?H?. 
EDITS requires that three modules are defined: an 
edit distance algorithm, a cost scheme for the three 
edit operations, and a set of rules expressing either 
entailment or contradiction. Each module can be 
easily configured by the user as well as the system 
parameters. EDITS can work at different levels of 
complexity, depending on the linguistic analysis 
carried on over ?T? and ?H?. Both linguistic pro-
cessors and semantic resources that are available to 
the user can be integrated within EDITS, resulting 
in a flexible, modular and extensible approach to 
textual entailment. 
 
 
Figure 2: An Example of two expressions 
EDITS can recognize.  
 
Figure 2 shows an example of two expressions 
that EDITS can recognize. EDITS will give an an-
swer that whether expression ?H? is true given that 
expression ?T? is true. The result is a Boolean val-
ue. If ?H? is true given ?T? is true, then the result 
is ?YES?, otherwise ?NO?. 
EDITS implements a distance-based frame-
work which assumes that the probability of an en-
tailment relation between a given ?T?-?H? pair is 
inversely proportional to the distance between ?T? 
and ?H? (i.e. the higher the distance, the lower is 
the probability of entailment). Within this frame-
work the system implements and harmonizes dif-
ferent approaches to distance computation, 
providing both edit distance algorithms, and simi-
larity algorithms. Each algorithm returns a normal-
ized distance score (a number between 0 and 1). At 
a training stage, distance scores calculated over 
annotated ?T?-?H? pairs are used to estimate a 
threshold that best separates positive from negative 
examples. The threshold, which is stored in a 
Model, is used at a test stage to assign an entail-
ment judgment and a confidence score to each test 
pair. 
 
 
Figure 3: Our configured file for training 
 
Figure 3 shows our configuration file for train-
ing models, we choose ?distance? algorithm in 
EDITS, and ?default_matcher?, and ?ignore_case? , 
and some other default but effective configured 
parameters. 
 
 
Figure 4: The overall training and decoding 
procedure in our system. 
 
Figure 4 shows our training and decoding 
procedure. As EDITS can only recognize textual 
entailment from one part to the other, we manually 
change the tag ?H? with ?T?, and generate the re-
sults again, and then compute two parts? entailment 
relations. For example, if ?T?-?H? is ?YES?, and 
?H?-?T? is ?NO?, then the entailment result be-
tween them is ?forward?; if ?T?-?H? is ?NO?, and 
?H?-?T? is ?YES?, then the entailment result be-
tween them is ?backward?; if both  ?T?-?H? and 
?H?-?T? are ?YES?, the result is ?bidirectional?; 
717
otherwise ?no_entailment?. 
3 Experiments and Results 
Since organizers of SemEval 2012 task 8 supply a 
piece of data for training, we thus exploit it to op-
timize parameters for EDITS. Table 1 shows the F-
measure score of training set analyzed by EDITS, 
where ?FE? represents French-English, ?SE? rep-
resents Spanish-English, ?IE? represents Italian-
English and ?GE? represents Italian-English.

Table 1:  Results on training set. 
 
From Table 1, we can see that the perfor-
mance of ?forward? prediction is lower than others. 
One explanation is that the ?T? is translated from 
foreign language, which is error unavoidable. Thus 
some rules used for checking ?T?, such as stop-
word list will be disabled. Then it is possible to 
induce a ?NO? relation between ?T? and ?H? that 
results in lower recall of ?forward?. 
Since for French-English, we build a system 
combination for improving the quality of transla-
tion. Table 2 shows the results of BLEU score of 
translation quality, and F-score of entailment 
judgment.

Table 2:  Performance of different translation

From table 2, we find that the translation qual-
ity slightly affect the correctness of entailment 
judgment. However, the difference of performance 
in entailment judgment is smaller than that in 
translation quality. We explain that the translation 
models exploit phrase-based rules to direct the 
translation, and the translation errors mainly come 
from the disorder between each phrases.  While a 
distance based entailment model generally consid-
ers the similarity of phrases between test and hy-
pothesis, thus the disorder of phrases influences the 
judgment slightly.   
Using the given training data for tuning pa-
rameters, table 3 to table 6 shows the detailed ex-
perimental results on testing data, where P

Table 10: Test results on German-English 
given different training set. 
 
Results in table 7 and table 8 shows that mod-
els trained on ?CLTE? have better performance 
than those trained on RTE1 and RTE2, except ?bi-
directional? judgment type. In Table 9, all results 
decoding by models trained on ?CLTE? are the 
best. And in Table 10, only a few results decoding 
by models trained on ?RTE1? and ?RTE2? have 
higher score. The reason may be that, the test cor-
pora are bilingual, there are some errors in the ma-
chine translation procedure when translate one part 
of the test from its language into the other. When 
training on these bilingual text and decoding these 
bilingual text, these two procedure have error con-
sistency. Some errors may be counteracted. If we 
train on RTE, a standard monolingual text, and 
decode a bilingual text, more errors may exist be-
tween the two procedures. So we believe that, if 
we use translation based strategy (machine transla-
tion and monolingual textual entailment) to gener-
ate cross-lingual textual entailment, we should use 
translation based strategy to train models, rather 
than use standard monolingual texts. 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we demonstrate our system frame-
work for this year?s cross-lingual textual entail-
ment task. We propose a translation based model 
to address cross-lingual entailment. We first trans-
late all foreign languages into English, and then 
employ EDITS to induce entailment relations. Ex-
periments show that our method achieves promis-
ing results but not perfect results compared to other 
participants.
