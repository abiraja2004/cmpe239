In this paper we address the prob- 
lem of compound noun indexing that 
is about segmenting or decomposing 
compound nouns into promising index 
terms. Compound nouns as index terms 
that usually subscribe to specific no- 
tions tend to increase the precision of 
retrieval performance. The use of the 
component nouns of a compound noun 
as index terms, on the other hand, may 
improve the recall performance, but can 
decrease the precision. 
Our proposed method to handle com- 
pound nouns with a goal to increase 
the recall while preserving the preci- 
sion computes the relevance of the com- 
ponent nouns of a compound noun to 
the document content by comparing the 
document sets that are supported by 
the component nouns and the terms of 
the document. The operational content 
of a term is represented as the proba- 
bilistic distribution of the term over the 
document set. 
Experiments with a set of 1,000 docu- 
ments show that our method gains 33% 
increase of retrieval performance com- 
pared to the indexing method without 
compound noun analysis, and is as good 
as manual decomposition by human ex- 
perts. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Automatic indexing renders a form of document 
representation that visualizes the content of the 
document more explicitly. Indices that are care- 
fully chosen to represent a document will bring 
about the improvement of retrieval performance 
in accuracy and time efficiency. The potential of 
a candidate index is often judged on the basis of 
its discriminating power over a docmnent set as 
well as its linguistic significance in the document. 
Thus, a good index term should distinguish a cer- 
tain class of documents from the rest of the doc- 
uments and be relevant o the subject matters of 
the class of documents to be indexed by the term. 
In general, automatic indexing consists of the 
identification of index terms and the assignment 
of weights to the terms (Salton 1983). 
An index term can be either a simple noun or a 
compound noun composed of more than one sim- 
ple nouns. Compound nouns tend to carry more 
specific contextual information than simple nouns, 
thus they are likely to contribute to the retrieval 
precision. Compound nouns may contain useful 
simple nouns that usually refer general contexts, 
and thus will boost the recall of retrieval. Process- 
ing compound nouns is decomposing them into 
simple nonns and evaluating the simple nouns as 
potential index terms. In both identifying and 
evaluating index terms, compound nouns require 
a different strategy from that for simple nouns. 
The identification of compound nouns involves a 
certain degree of linguistic or statistical analysis 
that varies from simple stemming to morphologi- 
cal analysis (Fagan 1989). 
What makes it even more complicated to han- 
dle compound nouns in Korean documents lies in 
the convention of writing compound nouns. In 
Korean, it is allowed to write compound nouns 
with or without intervening blanks between con- 
stituent nouns. Arbitrarily long compound nouns 
are possible and not rare in real texts. The de- 
composition of a compound noun is particularly 
problematic because of the severe ambiguity of 
segmentations. 
In this paper, we propose a method to iden- 
tify and evaluate the candidate index terms from 
compound nouns. First, each possible decomposi- 
tion of a compound noun is identified. To'see the 
potential of the component nouns of the decom- 
position, we observe how the component nouns 
are distributed over the total document set, and 
514 
also examine how the simple and componnd nouns 
of the current document are distributed over the 
same document set. The similarity of the two dis- 
tributions implies how consistently the two term 
sets will behave given a query at retriewd time. 
The proposed method assumes a dictionary of 
nouns that is automatically constructed from the 
document set. 3'his is the practice that has never 
been tried in Korean document indexing, but has 
some important merits. A laborious work for the 
manual construction of nominal dictionaries is not 
needed. Since the noun dictionary contains only 
those in a document set, the ambiguity in analyz- 
ing words is greatly reduced. 
Previous researches on the problem of com- 
pound noun indexing in Korean have been done in 
two directions. One approach adopts a full-scale 
morphological nalysis to decompose a word into a 
sequence of the smallest morpheme units that are 
all treated as index terms. The other approach 
tries to avoid the complexity of the full scale anal- 
ysis by using bigrams as in (Fnjii 199'3; l,ee 11996; 
Ogawa 1993). Since these methods take all the 
components of compound nouns as index terms 
without evaluation, irrelewmt erms can decrease 
retrieval precision. 
Experiments on 1000 documents how that our 
evaluation scheme gave results closet" to the hu- 
man intuition and maintained the highest preci- 
sion ratio of tile existing methods. 
In the following section, a brief review of re- 
lated work on automatic indexing for Korean doc- 
nments is made. Section 3 explains tile proposed 
method in detail. The verification of the method 
through experiments is described in section 4. 
Section 5 concludes the paper. 
2 Re la ted  Work  
The previous approaches to compound noun in- 
dexing are based either on full scale morpholog- 
ical analysis (Kang :1995; Kim 1983; Lee 1995; 
Seo 1993) or on the syllabic patterns (Fujii 1993 
; Lee 1996; Ogawa 1993). Morphological anal- 
ysis will return morphologically valid component 
words constituting a given compound word. Since 
this method does not exclude invalid or meaning- 
less words, it can result in the degradatiou of pre- 
cision. Besides the employment of full morpho- 
logical analysis is often too expensive and requires 
costly maintenance. 
Simpler methods egment componnd nouns me- 
chanically into unigram or bigram words that are 
all regarded as index terms (Lee 1996). Bigram in- 
dexes shows better precision than unigrams, but 
can suffer from big index size. In general, the ex- 
isting methods for compound noun analysis have 
been focused mainly on recall performance with 
little attention to the precision. The work pre- 
sented in this paper t'ries to achieve the improve- 
ment of recall without the deterioration of preci- 
documents

I ndex ing  
In this section, we describe the algorithm to rec- 
ognize and evaluate candidate index terms from 
compound nouns. Figure 1 summarizes the algo- 
rithm. The tokenizer produces a list of simple and 
compound nouns by utilizing the noun dictionary 
and the basic stermning rules. The noun dictio- 
nary is used to identify whether a noun is simple or 
compound, and the basic stemming rules are used 
to differentiate non-final words from others such 
as function words and verbs. The noun dictio- 
nary is automatically constructed from the obser- 
w~tion on the document set. The compound noun 
analyzer inw:stigates if the components of com- 
pound nouns are appropriate as indexes. The in- 
dex terrns that include simple nouns prodnced as 
a result of compound noun analysis are weighted, 
which finishes the indexing. 
l,et ?' and C denote the sets of simple and com- 
pound nouns, respectively. Simple nouns are, by 
definition, those that do not have any of their 
substrings as a noun according to the dictionary. 
Compound nouns are those one or more sub- 
strings of which are recognized as nouns. Let 
T = {7'l,7~,...,5/~} = EUC be the set of all 
simple and compound nouns of a document set. 
Also, let I) = {D1,Du, . . . ,Dg}  be the set of all 
documents. A document is represented as a list of 
term-weight (2~, Wi) pairs. 
For a compound noun Ci of a document, a de- 
525 
composit ion is a sequence of nouns (!T'~7~ ...Tk.). 
lit inany cases, there are there than one  de('olll- 
position, but only a few of thenl are sensible with 
respect o tim conte.xt of the document.  Indiscreet 
use of the component nouns lnay bring about the 
improvement of reall, but can lead to the signif- 
icant decrease of i)recision. In the following dis- 
cussions, we dest;ril)e the details of the algor ithm 
to select useful coinponent nouns from eOliipound 
Houns. 
3.1 Dict ionary |)uildu I) 
It is very difficult to provide an \[t{ systeni with 
the suf\[icient list of \[iOtlllS. tleeause the nomi- 
nals o/itnl l lnber {tnd grow faster than other cat- 
egories of words, it is more elticient to halidle 
non-nominal  words mamlal ly.  We consider buihl. 
ing noun dictionary by identifying the remaining 
string as a no/ill ai%er e l iminat ing non-llOiliil-lal 
part  of a word. The non-nominals  are verbs, ad- 
verbs, adjectives, prelixes, aud suf\[ixes. 
The words in non-nominal  dict ionaries do not 
include those that  can also be used as notins, 
whi(;h is not a probleni since unlike, in English, 
the lmllt i -eategorial  words in Korean telld to be 
invariant of meaning. The non-nonl inal  dict ionar- 
ies aye made usually hy manual work. 
Those recognized as non-nominal words but not 
as \[unction words are regarded as llOl.lns. '\['here

a tom?lNST 17~U MI';NTAL 
One way to deal with the probleni is to nse 
tim i)robabil ity of each function word and choose 
the one with the highest vahie. More accurate 
measure woukl be made using a t l idden Marker  
Model that  is about a stochastic process of fun(>- 
l ion words. 'Fhe function words are (:lassified into 
32 groups according to their roles and posit ion in 
sentences. In part icular ,  each segmentat ion of a 
word is evahtated as follows. 
P(G IG- ,  ) P(n) l ' ( i l n )  ? 
P(Ci ICi  - 1) is the probabi l i ty  of tl~e function cat- 
egory of current word given the category of the 
previous word. P(n)  is the probabi l i ty  of candi- 
date noun and l ' ( f ln  ) is the prot)abi l i ty e ra  fun(> 
tion word given the candidate noun. The best se- 
quence of these segmentat ions for a sentence can 
be obtained. The candidate nouns n of the best 
sequence are then 'added to the noun dictionary. 
a.2 Token iz ing  and  eo ln i )ound noun 
analysis 
Tokenizing aims at recognizing simple and com- 
pound nouns froni a text and report ing them as 
the the final index terms. The method for di(-tio- 
nary making is also us('.d for tokenizing. Since the 
d ict ionary making method gives a list; of candidate 
nouns, we only need to ctaeck if a candidate is a 
COml)ound noun and judge if the eompotl(mts el" 
the candidate compound noun e~re consistent, with 
the content of the deemneat,. 
To deal with the notion of consistency, we have 
to deiiue tile nwaning of a term or a set o\[" terms, 
It is a well recognized practice to regard the dis- 
cr iminat ing power of a terln as the value of the 
term. The qual ity of the ( l iserini inating power is 
the distr ibut ion of the tel'ill over a document set. 
We define the distr ibut ion of a terln as the Hleati.. 
ing of the terin. S imi lar ly the meaning of a set of 
terms is the distr ibut ion of terms on the dec/anent 
set.

5 Conc lus ion  
The compound analysis in automatic indexing 
aims at the improvement of recall performance 
by extracting useful component nouns fi'om com- 
pound nouns. The task for Korean texts requires 
extra efforts due to the complexity of inflections. 
The proposed method gives better potential of 
sustaining the precision while improving the recall 
than other approaches by making use of proba- 
bilistic distributions ofterms as the representation 
of meaning of the terms. 
The proposed method to evaluate the coinpo- 
nents of compound nouns is unique in that it de- 
lines and uses term representation, which explains 
the superiority of the method to other methods. 
The method requires little human involvement 
and is very promising for the implementation f 
practical systems by achieving efficiency and ac- 
curacy at the same time.
