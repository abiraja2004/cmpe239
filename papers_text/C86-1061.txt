The paper deals with a new approach to importance valuation of descrip- 
tive texts developed in the framework of SUSY, an experimental system in 
the domain of text snmmarization. The problem of taking into account he 
reader's goals in evaluating importance of different parts of a text is first 
analyzed. A solution to the design of a goal interpreter capable of com- 
puting a quantitative measure of the relevance degree of a piece of text 
according to a given goal is then proposed, and an example of goal inter- 
preter operation is provided. 
INTRODUCTION 
Importance valuation is one of the major issues in text understanding. 
Human readers, in fact, rank each new piece of information obtained from 
a text in a sort of importance hierarchy. The mental representation f the 
meaning of a text can not therefore be assumed to be fiat, objective, and 
reader-independent, butit generally contains a lot of subjective judgmental 
knowledge. Importance valuation ot only constitutes a fundamental skill 
in text summarizing and in related tasks (e.g., underlining, note taking, 
concept extraction, etc.) but, more generally, it is a prerequisite for any 
text understanding process. 
In recent years we have been working at a new approach to importance 
evaluation (Fum, Guida, and Tasso, 1985a and 1985b) that is supported by 
the development of SUSY, an experimental system in the specific domain 
of descriptive text summarization. Most of the research carried out in this 
field has been aimed at providing a procedural definition of the concept of 
importance relying on both structural and semantic knowledge. In this 
paper we focus on how it is possible to take into account, in evaluating 
importance, the goals of the reader, in order to investigate how they may 
inflnence the evaluation process and its output. In fact, it is expected not 
only that different representations of the same text will be produced, but 
also that goals will directly affect the way importance is evaluated. 
BASIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE EVALUATOR 
The importance valuator is one of the fundamental subsystems of SUSY, 
and it is specifically devoted to the task of ranking different parts of a text 
according to their importance (Fum, Guida, and Tasso 1985b). 
Several reasons have supported the choice of implementing the importance 
evaluator by means of a rule-based approach (Waterman and Hayes-Roth, 
1978). First of all, the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the knowledge 
involved in the process of importance valuation has to be mentioned: 
linguistic knowledge (both structural and semantic), world knowledge 
(including both common sense and domain specific knowledge), 
knowledge about reader's goals, meta-knowledge about how to use lingnis- 
tic knowledge, world knowledge, and goals in the process of importance 
evaluation. Second, the concept of importance seems to escape a simple, 
explicit, algorithmic definition. A conceptual unit of a text can be con- 
sidered important, for example, because it helps understanding discourse 
coherence, or because it relates to the discourse topic or topic-focus articu- 
lation of discourse, or because it refers to semantically important concepts 
in the subject domain, or, finally, because it refers to a given reader's goal. 
A rule-based approach comprising a set of rules that can assign relative 
importance values to the different conceptual units of a text seems there- 
fore more viable than a traditional deterministic solution, as it can supply 
all the conceptual and computational tools needed for taking into account 
in a flexible mad natural way the variety of knowledge sources and pro- 
cessing activities that are involved in importance evaluation. 
The overall architecture of the evaluator is shown in Figure 1.

Basically, it is constituted by the standalzl modules of a rule-based system 
(Waterman and Hayes-Roth, 1978) with the addition of a specialized 
module, namely the goal interpreter, devoted to take into consideration the 
reader's goal. 
The evaluator eceives in input the internal representation f a natural 
language text (supplied by another SUSY subsystem, namely the parser) 
expressed in the ELR (Extended Linear Representation) formalism (Fum, 
Guida, and Tasso, 1984), and an explicit representation f a goal to be 
taken into account for importance valnation. It produces in output a new

repl~sentation called HPN (IIierarchical Propositional Network), where 
integer importance values are assigned to tile basic conceptual units of the 
ELR (concepts and propositions), in snch a way as to account for tile 
different importance of the constituents of the text. 
Two main knowledge bases are available to tl~e evaluator: 
- the importance rule base, flint contains knowledge on the mechanisms 
that are supposed to be used by human readers in evaluating importance, 
expressed through W-THEN rules; 
- the encyclopedia, that contains pecific world knowledge on the subject 
domain (mostly of structured, taxonomic, descriptive nature), represented 
through a network of frames. 
Tile W-part of a ride contains conditions that are evaluated with respect o 
tile current HPN (initially the ELR) contaiued in the working memory. 
The THEN-part specifies either an importance valuation action or an 
action to be performed to further the analysis (e.g., a strategic hoice con- 
ceming rule activation, a criterion to solve conflicting ewduations, the 
activation of a frame of the encyclopedia, etc.). Botll parts of a rule may 
refer to frames of the encyclopedia. 
The importance valuation action contained in the THEN-part of a rule 
takes usually the form of an assignment of an importance value to a con- 
cept or proposition of the ELR. Snch an assignment may be absolute (e.g., 
w(X)=9) or relative (e.g. w(X)=w(X)-3). All successive assigmnents o a 
given concept or proposition are not directly executed, but they are stored 
in a list together with the number of the rules from which they originate, 
and only at the end of the importance valuation activity riley are globally 
considered in order to obtain a unique importance value. 
Ttle importmlce mle base includes several classes of nlles which account 
for the different skills used in importance valuation. Namely (Fnm, 
Guida, and Tasso, 1985b): 
- referential-structural (RS) rules can derive importance values fi'om the 
strncture of references among conceptual units of tile text, 
- rhetoric-structural ('1S) rules derive importance relation l?om rhetoric 
predicates of the ELR, 
- structural-semantic (SS) rules rely on the analysis of specific structural 
features of tile text that have a definite semantic role, such as ISA rela- 
tions and macro-predicates of tile ELR, 
- semantic-encyclopedic (SE) rules refer to world knowledge contained in 
the encyclopedia, 
- explicit evahtation (EEl rules take into account explicit statements con- 
cerning importance sometimes purposedly inserted in tile text by file 
author, and, finally, 
- metarules (MT) embody strategic knowledge that concerns reasoning 
about importance rules aud their use. 
The encyclopedia s the second knowledge somve employed by the evalua- 
tot and it contains domain specitic knowledge in form of frames. The 
frames of file encyclopedia embody, in addition to a header two kinds of 
slots: 
- knowledge slots, that contain domain specific knowledge, represented in
a form homogeneous with tile ELR language; 
- reference slots, containing Ix)inters to other frames that deal with related 
topics in the subject domain. 
The operation of tile evaluator obeys the basic recognize-act ycle of a 
rule-based system. Mo~e specifcally, it is controlled by a forward chaining 
mechanism which continually updates the working memory, thus 
U'anslbrming it in the final HPN form. The marcher is responsible for 
recognizing ELR patterns in the working memory which satisfy the W-part 
of importance rules. The W-part of a rule may contain a specific reference 
to the goal interpreter when it is needed to evaluate tile relevance of a 
given concept or proposition (belonging to tile ELR or to the encyclo- 
pedia) to the cmxent goal. In such a case the marcher esorts to the goal 
interpreter, which is able to compute file required relevance degree, 
expressed through a real value in the range (0,1). 
When the conflict set has been identified, the conflict resolutor selects the 
unique rule whosn THEN-part will later be executed. System operation 
ends when the conflict set is empty, i.e. when all available resources for 
importance valuation have been used. Several strategies are utilized for 
performing conflict resolution, and they basically obey two paradigms, 
namely refraction and ordering (Brownston, Farrel, Kant, and Martin, 
I985). 
Refraction implies that a rule can not be executed more than once on file 
same data. On the contrary, it has to be noticed that a single rule can be 
fired several times on different data during the process of importance 
evaluation. Iu fact, the ELR can possibly contain several instances of the 
patterns conlorming to the specific criteria of importance valuation cap- 
lured by a ride. 
Rule ordering implies that each importance rule is attached a weight (au 
integer value) in such a way as to define an ordering relation among rules. 
During conflict resolution this ordering is used in two different ways: for 
selecting the rule with the highest weight, or for discarding rules below a 
given threshold. Weights are initially assigned statically and ,are later 
updated ynamically at run-time. The static ordering is provided when a 
rule is created, encoding in snch a way general selection criteria regarding 
the priority of using some rules rather than others at the beginning of the 
importance valuation process. Dynamic updating of weights allows later 
on the evaluator to conform to different conflict resolution criteria, adapt- 
ing its behavior to the actual course of the step-wise transformation f the 
ELR iuto the HPN. Null weights are utilized to prevent the possible 
unwanted execution of a rule. Each time the evaluator is utilized on a new 
text, the weights arc reset o their original static vah, es. 
ROLE AND REPRESENTATION OF GOALS 
It is apparent that reader's goals have a major role in evalnating impor- 
tance of a written text. Goals that: exist a-priori in the reader's mind, i.e. 
before reading a text, can affect his judgemental ctivity in two quite dis- 
tinct ways. First, the existence of goals can trigger an evaluation mechan- 
ism that tends to identify as important hose parts of the text which arc 
relevant to the current goal (goal-directed evaluation). As goal-directed 
evaluation strategies coexist with other strategies which are indepeudent of
tile existence of goals, it is necessary that tlley would appropriately fit 
together in such a way as to achieve a correct balance between goal- 
dependent and goal-independent judgements. Secoud, goals can have a 
major role in directing the retrieval and use of encyclopedic knowledge 
relewmt o the current importance valuation activity (selective focusing). 
In fact, a human reader generally utilizes a lot of specific world 
kuowledge when evaluating tile importance of a text, and tile reminding 
from loug term memory of the pieces of knowledge to be used in a given 
context is often triggered by his a-priori goals. In this case, goals do not 
directly contribute to the importance valuation process, but can affect it 
in an indirect way throngh identification of pertinent world knowledge to 
be used by other goal-independent importance evaluation strategies. 
Using goals in importance valuation poses two classes of problems to the 
system designer: 
- How to represent goals? 
- Itow to match goals with pieces of tllc ELR or encyclopedia for imple- 
menting the mechanisms of goal-directed evaluation and selective focus- 
ing? 
The former of the above points will be dealt with in the sequel of this sec- 
tion, while the latter will be the subject of the next section. 
Several kinds of reader's goals are possible with respect o their generality, 
level of abstraction, articulation of content, richness of details, etc. It is 
apparent that goals, according to their different nature, may range from a 
light emphasis of the reader's intentions to a quite specific que~3'. More 
precise and articulated the goals are, more focused is the attention on well 
defined and specific objects, and, accordingly, goal-dependent importance 
ev.'duation strategies become more appropriate and useful. Moreover, as 
goals become more and more specific and rich, importance valuation 
teuds to mingle with information retrieval and question-answering. 
As a basic design choice, we restrict our attention (at least for the 
moment) to classes of goals which are reasonably general and simple (but 
not necessarily explicit, univocal, clear, or easy to interpret!), in such a 
way as to keep focusing on importance valuation without intermixing too 
much our model with different issues, such as information retrieval and 
qnestion-answering. 
This decision has heavy implications on the design of the goal representa- 
tion language. Although in principle nothing less tban tile full ELR for- 
realism should be nsed tbr expressing oals, we restrict our attention to a 
largely simplified subset of it. 
Let us consider a goal vocabulary (GV) containing a collection of key- 
words relevant 'a a given subject domain, and assume as an adequate 
257 
representation for a goal a propositional expression over GV made up 
using and, or, and not connectives. Note that the goal vocabulary GV may 
be redundant, i.e. it may contain several words that refer to partially over- 
lapping concepts. Also it is implicitly assumed that the general topic of 
discourse is fixed and always tacitly understood: words of GV only specify 
a facet, a viewpoint or a detail of interest, but they can not change or 
modify (e.g., through limitations or specifications) the topic of discourse. 
Moreover, it is assumed that the size of GV can be kept reasonably small, 
although each time a new interesting concept has to be included in the 
coverage of the goal representation language, GV must be enlarged 
accordingly. 
INTERPRETING GOALS 
After having introduced a representation language to be used for specify- 
ing goals, we tackle in this section the problem of how it is possible to 
obtain goal dependent importance evaluation. 
The first possibility that comes to mind consists in labeling a-priori each 
frame of the encyclopedia with words of the goal vocabulary GV and, 
then, to match words used for expressing oals with such labels, taking 
appropriately into account he logical connectives and, or, and not. Tbis 
solution is only possible for the encyclopedia, s it is quite impossible to 
label a-priori unknown pieces of ELR. It shares some basic features with 
the approach proposed by DeJong (1979) that assumes an a-priori 
definition of the concept of importance coded into an appropriate set of 
scripts. This solution, however, has several shortcomings: 
(a) it is rigid, as any change in GV necessitates that the labeling of the 
encyclopedia is changed accordingly; 
(b) it hiddens the reasons and criteria adopted for labeling the frames of 
the encyclopedia, thus preventing any further use of this information (for 
example, in generating justifications of the evaluation produced); 
(c) it makes the encyclopedia heavily dependent on the specific nse of 
importance valuation and on the particular goal vocabulary currently con- 
sidered. 
A better solution, that can cover both cases of comparison with the ency- 
clopedia and ELR and does not require any preliminary labeling pro- 
cedure, is direct matching of words of GV appearing in the goal 
specification with frames of the encyclopedia or pieces of the ELR, taking 
appropriately into account he meaning of logical connectives. This possi- 
bility, however, woold also be largely unsatisfactory. It does not allow tak- 
ing into account, for example, the diversity of terminology, i.e. the fact 
that the same concept may be referred to by means of different words in 
the goal specification and in the piece of knowledge to be matched; it does 
not allow dealing with concepts at different levels of abstraction, and, 
more importantly, it does not allow expressing different degrees of 
relevance. 
The above analysis of inadequacies of some preliminary design proposals 
allows stating the following requirements for the goal interpreter: 
- it should allow to keep the goal vocabulary GV and the encyclopedia 
independent from each other, in such a way as changes in die former do 
not affect the latter, and they can be designed and updated separately; 
- it should support an explicit representation f the conceptual connection 
between the goal vocabulary GV and the encyclopedia and ELR, in such a 
way as the role of goals in importance evaluation can be easily controlled 
by the system designer and, if necessary, explained and justified to the 
user; 
- it should allow dealing with diversity of terminology, expression, con- 
text, and level of abstraction; 
- it should allow dealing with a full range of relevance degrees. 
We propose here a first step towards the design of a goal interpreter satis- 
fying the above mentioned requirements. Such an interpreter takes in input 
a goal specification, expressed in the goal representation language, and a 
fragment of ELR taken from the internal representation f the text or from 
the frames of the encyclopedia. Its task is to compute the relevance degree 
of the ELR fragment according to the given goal. To this purpose, the goal 
interpreter utilizes a referential knowledge base, i.e., a semantic network 
whose nodes are either atomic concepts that represent basic items in the 
subject domain or definitional concepts, i.e., structures that are used in 
order to define the meaning of atomic concepts. The are~ of the network 
258 
connect pairs of nodes linked together by some conceptual relation such as 
synonymy, antonymy, generalization, specification, definition, attribute, 
etc. Each arc is tagged by a label, indicating the conceptual relation link- 
ing the two concepts, and by a real number in the range (0 - 1) which 
represents the relation degree that characterizes the link between the two 
concepts. The referential knowledge base represents he main knowledge 
source utilized by the goal interpreter in evaluating the relevance degree of 
an ELR fragment to a given goal. General knowledge regarding the sub- 
ject domain and, more specifically, concerning the discourse topic is thus 
wired in the referential knowledge base. 
The semantic network which constitutes the referential knowledge base is 
accessed starting from the ELR fragment in parallel. At this point a 
bidirectional search process, aimed at finding a path connecting the two 
entry points, begins. The search is complicated by the fact that some nodes 
of the network are constituted by atomic concepts whereas other nodes are 
definitional. It is possible to proceed from a definitional node onwards if 
and only if all the concepts constituting the definition can be matched, 
directly or through intermediate nodes, with ELR expressions. The search 
process terminates when a path connecting the goal and the ELR fragment 
is found. An appropriate function taking into account he relation degrees 
of the arcs in the path is computed and the result represents he relevance 
degree of the ELR fragment o the given goal. Whenever possible an 
optimum path (i.e. a path with the highest relevance degree) should be 
looked for, bnt such a search generally poses hard problems from a com- 
putational point of view. 
AN E X A M P L E  
This section is devoted to present an example of operation of the goal 
interpreter. Let us consider the following fragment of text, taken from 
Christian (1983: 11): 
"... The UNIX system is a moderately complex operating sys- 
tem. It is far simpler than the operating systems that run on 
maxicomtmters, but it has much more capabilities than most 
operating systems that run on microcomputers. For example, 
the UNIX system allows several programs to run simultane- 
ously...." 
The purpose of this example is to show how the goal interpreter is able to 
identify that the last sentence of the text is to be considered important if 
evaluated with reference to the goal USE. By applying usual referential- 
structural rules, the concept UNIX is stressed as important since it is 
highly referenced in the text. The ELR representation f the last sentence 
is: 
180 ALLOW (UNIX, 190, P) 
190 RUN (VV3) 
200 *PROGRAM (VV3) 
210 SEVERAL (VV3) 
220 SIMULTANEOUSLY (190, P) 
Consider now the following semantic-encyclopedic rule: 
Rule SE26 
IF there is a proposition P A(X,Y) such that: 
- A ISA PERFORM 
- w(X) >= high 
- the relevance degree of Y to the current goal is >= 0.5 
THEN set w(P) = w(X). 
The rationale behind rule SE26 is that a sentence concerning an important 
concept is also considered important when its predicate is of kind 
PERFORM and its second argument (i.e., what is predicated about the 
important concept) is relevant to the current goal. 
The first two clauses of the IF-parr of the rule match proposition 180, 
since ALLOW ISA PERFORM and w(UNIX)=high. For what concerns the 
third clause, a deeper analysis involving the goal interpreter is needed.

More specifically, the relevance degree of proposition 190, which in turn 
involves also proFositions 200, 210, and 220, has to be evaluated with 
reference to the goal USE. The portion of referential knowledge utilized 
by the goal interpreter in this specific ase is shown in Figure 2. 
The network is entered through the word USE, corresponding to the goal, 
and the nodes RUN, PROGRAM, and SIMULTANEOUSLY. By moving 
through the netwolk from both entries, the path drawn in bold lines in Fig- 
ure 2 is identified. The definitional node corresponding to the MULTI- 
TASKING concept is entered from the ELR lhrougb multiple (namely, 
three) arcs. The overall relevance degree of the path is computed by multi- 
plying the relation degrees of its arcs and the result 0.58 is obtained. It 
should be noted that, among the several arcs entering a definitional node, 
only that with the lowest relation degree is considered for the computation. 
In this way, rule SE26 can be applied and, consequently, the importance 
value of proposition 180 is set to high. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The evalnator described in the paper is presently running in a prototype 
version (with about 50 rules and a small encyclopedia of about 40 
frames) written in LISP on a SUN-2 workstation. It has been extensively 
tested on selected cases (extracted from textbcx)ks on operating systems), 
and it includes a preliminary implementation f the goal interpreter based 
on a simplified version of the referential knowledge base. Research work 
devoted to extend and refine this first version of the goal interpreter and to 
test its performance is now ongoing., 
Several open problems and challenging tOlfiCS will be the subject of future 
research. Among these we mention: 
- extending the goal representation kmgnage; 
- merging the encyclopedia nd the referential knowledge base into a 
unified structure that encompasses all knowledge awtilable on the subject 
domain and can make it available in an effective way to the relevant 
modules of the ewduator (Sowa, 1984); 
- considering oals Ihat can change during text noderstauding, taking into 
account he topic-tbcus articulation of discotR'se - (Hajic.ova' and Sgall, 
1984); 
- developing an explaa tion module that can justify the reasons behind the 
ovatua|iol\[IS l)rothlccd by the syst(:nl.
