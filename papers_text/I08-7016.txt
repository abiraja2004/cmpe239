Abstract 
This paper presents an ongoing research 
aimed to build the first corpus, 5 million 
words, for Mongolian language by focus-
ing on annotating and tagging corpus texts 
according to TEI XML (McQueen, 2004) 
format. Also, a tool, MCBuilder, which 
provides support for flexibly and manually 
annotating and manipulating the corpus 
texts with XML structure, is presented. 
1 Introduction 
Mongolian researchers quite recently have begun 
to be involved in the research area of Natural Lan-
guage Processing. All necessary linguistic re-
sources, which are required for Mongolian lan-
guage processing, have to be built from scratch, 
and then they should be shared in public research 
for the rapid development of Mongolian language 
processing. 
This ongoing research aims to build a tagged 
and parsed 5 million words corpus for Mongolian 
by developing a spell-checker, tagger, sentence-
parser and others (see Figure 1 and 2). Also, we 
needed to develop a tagset for the corpus because 
there was not any tagset for Mongolian and the 
traditional words categories are not appropriate to 
it. Thus, we designed a high level tagset, which 
consists of 20 tags, and are further classifying them. 
Currently, we have collected and populated 500 
thousand words, 50 thousand of which have been 
manually tagged, into the corpus (see Figure 1).

Mongolian corpus. 
 
And, we manually build the corpus until collect-
ing and annotating 1 million words and tagging 
100 thousand words of them for semi-
automatically building the corpus in the future. 
2 Corpus Building Design 
We are building the corpus as sub-corpora, which 
are a raw corpus, a cleaned corpus, a tagged corpus 
and a parsed corpus, separately for various kinds of 
studying and use on Mongolian language (Figure 
2).

corpus. 
At first, we are collecting the editorial articles of 
Unen newspaper (Unen publish), which is one of

the best written newspapers in Mongolia, by using 
OCR application. We will also collect laws, school 
book, and literary text (see Figure 3).

The corpus annotation follows TEI XML stan-
dard. According to the work scope, the annotating 
part is divided into two parts that are structural an-
notation such as paragraphs, sentences, and so on, 
and POS tagging. 
The structure of the text annotation is presented 
in Figure 4.

    </s> 
    </body> 
  </text> 
</tei>

For annotating two parts, once a manual corpus 
builder, called MCBuilder, were planned to de-
velop, we have developed the first version and 
used to annotating 500 thousand word texts and 
tagging 50 of them (see Figure 5).

its main view. 
MCBuilder has three main windows that are (1) 
manipulating and organizing the corpus, (2) anno-
tating sample texts and (3) manipulating tagset as 
shown in Figure 5. 
3 Conclusion 
Mongolian language has hardly studied by com-
puter, and its traditional rules such as inflectional, 
derivational, part of speech, sentence constituents, 
etc are extremely difficult to computerize. Our re-
search works in the last few years showed it 
(Purev, 2006). Therefore, we are revising them by 
creating a corpus for computer processing. 
The proposals of this ongoing research are the 
first Mongolian 5 million words corpus, and tools 
that are spell-checker, tagger and parser. 
Currently, we have done followings: 
? Defined the corpus design, XML structure 
of the corpus text, and  the high level tagset 
? Collected and annotated 500 thousand 
words text 
? Tagged 50 thousand words 
? Released the first version of a Mongolian 
corpus building tool called MCBuilder 
? First versions of Syllable-parser and 
Morph-analyzer for Mongolian 
We are planning to complete the corpus in the 
next two years.
