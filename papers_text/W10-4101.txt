Abstract 
The authors propose that we need some 
change for the current technology in 
Chinese word segmentation. We should 
have separate and different phases in the 
so-called segmentation. First of all, we 
need to limit segmentation only to the 
segmentation of Chinese characters in-
stead of the so-called Chinese words. In 
character segmentation, we will extract 
all the information of each character. 
Then we start a phase called Chinese 
morphological processing (CMP). The 
first step of CMP is to do a combination 
of the separate characters and is then fol-
lowed by post-segmentation processing, 
including all sorts of repetitive structures, 
Chinese-style abbreviations, recognition 
of pseudo-OOVs and their processing, 
etc. The most part of post-segmentation 
processing may have to be done by some 
rule-based sub-routines, thus we need 
change the current corpus-based meth-
odology by merging with rule-based 
technique. 
1 Introduction 
Chinese word segmentation seems to be an old 
grandma?s story. We very often hear some con-
tradictory remarks about its advance. Most of 
reports from the evaluation tasks always gave us 
positive, or even impressive results, such as over 
96% accuracy, but some reports were rather 
negative and expressed their deep concern. They 
claimed that word segmentation was still entan-
gled in a difficult situation and no breakthrough 
in real applications. By careful and longtime ob-
servation, the incompetence is usually caused by 
the coarseness in the currently prevalent tech-
nology. 
We carefully observed some Chinese-English 
MT systems and found some errors were caused 
even in the very early stage of the processing, 
that is, in the stage of word segmentation. No 
matter the MT is statistics-based or rule-based, 
they have their Achilles' heel in the segmenta-
tion stage. Can today?s prevalent technology 
effectively cope with the problem? Or do we 
need some change? The present technology is 
characterized by its ?trilogy?, that is, ?corpora + 
statistics (ML) + evaluation?. We regret to say 
that many researchers today may be indulged in 
methodology itself rather than the language they 
have to target. They are enchanted by the scores 
and ranks, but they forget the object they are 
processing. 
Therefore we propose that a Chinese morpho-
logical processing (CMP) should be taken to 
replace the current Chinese word segmentation. 
CMP includes the following components: 
? Chinese character processing (CCP) 
? Initial combination of Chinese multi-
character expressions (CMEs) 
? Morphological structure processing 
(MSP) 
2 Chinese character processing 
2.1 ?Word? in Chinese 
?Word or no word? may be an even older story 
in Chinese linguistic circle. One assertion about 
Chinese words may be quite popular, even to 
most of western researchers in the NLP circle, 
that is, different from English or other western 
languages, there is no space between Chinese 
words and thus segmentation of a running text 
into words is necessary for Chinese processing. 
However, do words really exist in Chinese? It is 
still a vexing and controversial issue. Some 
Chinese grammarians argue that in Chinese there 
are no words at all, but there are only characters 
instead and some express their strong objection. 
What is a Chinese ?word?? It was reported 
that the concept of ?word? had not been intro-
duced into China until the very beginning of the 
last century. In fact word is alien to Chinese. At 
least the concept of word in Chinese is rather 
vague. In Chinese there are no clear-cut distinc-
tion between characters and so-called word, ei-
ther between multi-character words and those 
that are similar to English MWE. Ordinary Eng-
lish people may be surprised if they are told that 
even in popular Chinese dictionaries there are no 
entries equivalent to English ?pork (??)?, 
?beef ??)?, ?egg (??)?, ?rain (verb ??)?, 
?snow (verb ??)?, but there are entries equiva-
lent to English ?lower limbs(??)?, ?give or-
ders (??)?, ?appendicitis (???)?. There is 
somewhat arbitrariness in recognition of Chinese 
?words?, so the vocabulary in different Chinese 
dictionaries may vary very greatly. Does a dic-
tionary take usage frequency into account when 
it decides on its entries? Let?s compare their oc-
currence with the following entries in the dic-
tionary as shown in Table 1. Let?s compare the 
occurrence with the following entries in different 
dictionaries and in reference to Google?s results. 
In Table 1, ?-? indicates that the entry does not 
occur and ?+? indicates the entry occurs.

In a word, since ?word? in Chinese is rather 
vague, what is a better tactics we should take 
then? The present word segmentation is bur-
dened too heavily. In comparison with English 
tokenization, it goes too far. Does English to-
kenization deal with MWEs, such as ?United 
nations?, ?free of charge?, ?first lady?? Why 
does Chinese word segmentation have to deal 
with Chinese multi-character ?word?? 
2.2 Chinese character processing (CCP) 
We propose that the real task of so-called Chi-
nese word segmentation is to segment a running 
text into single characters with spaces between. 
We call this processing Chinese character proc-
essing (CCP). CCP is in parallel with English 
tokenization. In most cases CCP can achieve 
100% accuracy. The most important task for 
CCP is not only to segment a text, but also to 
obtain various kinds of information (syntactic, 
semantic) of every character. What will be fol-
lowed depends on the tasks to be designated. 
Usually a demand-led morphological processing 
will be taken. 
3 Initial combination 
In most cases, what we called initial combina-
tion of Chinese multi-character expressions 
(CMEs) should be followed indispensably. It 
may be either shallow or deep, and may be done 
either with the help of a lexical database or a 
corpus, and the longest matching may be the 
frequently-used technique.   
4 Morphological structure processing 
(MSP) 
4.1 Pseudo-OOVs 
The first task of MSP is to recognize and process 
Chinese OOVs. What are OOVs in English? 
Normally if a string between two spaces in a 
running text does not exist in the lexical 
database or the corpus the processing system is 
using, this string is taken as an OOV. However, 
what is an OOV in Chinese then? It is really not 
so easy to define an OOV in Chinese as in 
English. The recognition of English OOVs may 
be done in the phase of tokenization, but the 
recognition of Chinese OOVs should, in a strict 
sense, not be done in so-called word 
segmentation. It should be regarded as a special 
phase of the morphological processing. It is 
commonly acknowledged that OOV recognition 
is the most serious factor that impairs the 
performance of current Chinese word 
segmentation.  
We may first look at some instances of ma-
chine translation results and find the actual prob-
lems. The reason why we use MT systems to test 
and evaluate segmentation is because this will 
make it explicit and easy for human to assess. 
One error in segmentation makes a 100% failure 
in translation. In our examples, the translation (a) 
is done by a statistical MT system and the trans-
lation (b) by a rule-based MT system. (C) is hu-
man translation, which may help make compari-
son and find the errors made by MT. 
 
1. ?????????? 2020????? 
(a) Americans even behind the bid to host 
the 2020 Olympic Games in Nanjing. 
(b) American people's strength holds out 
in Nanjing and bids for the 2020 Olympic 
Games. 
(c) Americans fully backed up Nanjing?s 
bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games. 
 
Chinese OOVs can be roughly categorized 
into two classes, one is true OOVs and the other 
is pseudo-OOVs. The recognition and process-
ing of true OOVs can be done as English OOVs 
are treated in English.  However, the recognition 
and processing of Chinese pseudo-OOVs should 
be done by a special processing module. Chinese 
pseudo-OOVs includes two types: plain pseudo-
OOVs, such as ????, ????, ????, ????, 
????, ????, and abbreviated pseudo-OOVs, 
such as ????, ????, ????, ????, ???
???, ?????, ?????, ?????, ???
??, ?????, ??????. 
? Plain pseudo-OOVs 
A pseudo-OOV is a combinatory string of 
Chinese characters in which each character car-
ries one of its original meanings and the way of 
combination conforms to Chinese grammatical 
pattern. In the above Chinese sentence the word 
???? is a typical pseudo-OOV. ???? is a 
combination of two characters, ??? and ???. 
??? has four meanings, one of which is ?do 
one?s best?. ??? has six meanings, one of which 
is ?back up?. Originally in Chinese dictionaries 
we can find the following expressions similar to 
the pattern of ????, such as ????, ????, 
????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ??
??, ????, ????, ????, ????. In all 
these expressions the character ??? carries the 
same meaning as that in ????, and the second 
characters in the combinations are all actions. 
Therefore the expression ???? is a grammati-
cal and meaningful pseudo-OOV. It should be 
noticed that this kind of pseudo-OOV is highly 
productive in Chinese. In addition to all the dic-
tionary entries that we listed above, we found 
???(to strongly state)?and ???(to strongly 
resist)? are already used in the web. Its highly 
occurrence in real texts calls our special atten-
tion. Let?s see how MT will tackle them poorly. 
 
2. ?????????? 
(a) Chen multiple defense of human 
doubt. 
(b) Many old doubtful points of the man-
power of pleading. 
(c) The pleader argued and showed many 
doubtful points. 
We wonder how the current technique of 
segmentation tackles the problem. We are not 
sure how one error in a segmentation effect the 
score in Bakeoff.  
Let?s look at two more examples and have a 
brief discussion of them. 
 
3.?????????????????
??????????? 
(a) According to neighbors reflected the 
incident that day at noon there is a fast food 
take-Lang came to the victim's home.  
(b) According to the information of 
neighbour's, a fast food takes out the my 
darling to been to victim's home at noon on 
the day when the case happened. 
(c) According to the neighbors, at noon on 
the same day a fast food takeout boy came 
to the victim?s house. 
 
4. ???????????? 
(a) One officer was stabbed to death the 
women pedicure. 
(b) An officer is trimmed the foot daughter 
and assassinated.  
(c) An official was stabbed to death by the 
girl pedicurist. 
 
All the four erroneous MT translations above 
originate from the so-called recognition of 
OOVs ????? and ????? in the segmenta-
tion. The MT systems might make out ??
??and ??? or ???? and ??? separately, but 
fail to recognize their combinations. The combi-
nation pattern of these two plain pseudo-OOVs 
is a very typical and popular one in Chinese, just 
similar to the suffix ?-er? or ?-or? in English to 
derive a noun of a doer. ????? is a combina-
tion of ????(takeout) and ???(boy). When a 
MT failed to tackle it, the translation would be 
so poor. 
? Abbreviated pseudo-OOVs 
Different from English abbreviations or acro-
nyms, Chinese abbreviations in essence are con-
tracted forms of words and expressions. The 
contraction is mainly related to three factors: (1) 
maximal preservation of the original meaning; (2) 
possible maintenance of Chinese grammatical 
structural pattern; (3) consideration of accept-
ableness of rhythm. Let?s take ????? for ex-
ample. ????? is the contraction of 
?????????. The literal translation of the 
expression is ?maintain stability office?. Thus 
the first part of the expression ?????? is 
contracted to ????, and the second part is con-
tracted to ???. ?????? grammatically is a 
?verb + object? structure while ???? can be 
regarded as the same grammatical structure. 
Grammatically ????? is modified by 
??????, and in the contraction the word 
??? is also modified by the contraction ????. 
As for acceptableness of rhythm, ????? is a 
three-character expression, in which the first two 
are a ?verb + object structure and the last is sin-
gle. The structure of ?2-character verb + 1-
character noun? is a highly-productive pattern of 
noun expression in Chinese. So it is desirable to 
process this type of structures before syntactic 
processing. As the structure can usually be pat-
ternized, it is possible to have them well-
processed. We propose that we should deal with 
it in the morphological processing stage. 
4.2 Repetitive structures 
First let?s look at a MT translation and see what 
has happened when a Chinese repetitive struc-
ture is ill-processed. 
 
5. ?????????? 
(a) Come see Chuan Chuan, too small. 
(b) You come to wear looking, it is too 
small. 
(c) Come and try on, it is too small. 
 
The above two erroneous MT translations (a) 
and (b) originate from the failure in dealing with 
a typical verb structural pattern for expression to 
urge someone to have a try. This pattern is: 
??VV ?, its actual meaning is ?have a try? and 
?to see if ??. The literal translation of the above 
???instance ? ? may be ?put on, put on and 
let?s have a look?. Similarly we can have 
???? ? (which can be literally translated as 
?taste, taste, and let?s see?). 
Chinese is unique with its various types of re-
petitive structures. They are by no means rare 
phenomena in real texts. Any negligence or fail-
ure in the processing of repetitive structures will 
surely spoil the succedent tasks. Unfortunately 
this problem has not caught enough attention of 
researchers and developers of word segmenta-
tion tools. Most of neglecters usually leave the 
problem to the vocabulary that they collect. 
Let?s compare the following two groups of 
translations: 
Group A 
????????????????? 
???????????? 
Group B 
???????????????? 
????????????? 
Group A1 
You listen carefully, is not where the leak 
was. 
He looked at the stop next to the train. 
Group B1 
Carefully you chew a chewing is not a 
mint flavor. 
He sat down, then back by the by. 
 
The English translations of the repetitive 
structures in Group A1 are acceptable for the 
??? ???structures ? ? and ? ? are no doubt 
in the vocabulary. And the translations of Group 
B are messy enough to show that the repetitive 
structures become OOVs and are not well-
processed.  
Generally most of Chinese repetitive struc-
tures originate from three word classes: 
? Verb repetitive patterns: 
AA   ??, ?? ??,  
ABAB  ???? ????,  
? ?A / A  ??? ??? ,  
?AA   ??? ???,  
A??/?A  ???? ????????, ,  
 
? Adjective repetitive patterns: 
AA   ?? ?? ?? ??, , ,  
AABB  ???? ???? , ,???? 
ABAB  ???? ????,  
 
? Classifier repetitive patterns: 
AA  ??????? ,  
????????? 
?AA ??? ??? ??? , , ,  
??? 
?A?A ???? ???????? , ,  
?A??A  ????? ?????, ,  
????? 
 
All these patterns are highly productive in 
Chinese. It will be impracticable for any Chinese 
parsing or MT systems to leave all the resolu-
tions of them to the vocabulary rather than spe-
cial processing module. 
4.3 Plain classifier and unit structures 
Chinese is featured by its plenty of classifiers. In 
many cases a concrete noun occurs idiomatically 
with its particular classifier especially when 
modified a numeral, for example, ?????(a 
person), ?????(two cars), ???????(3 
kilos of apples). The processing of this type of 
structures will surely benefit the succeeding 
parsing and even word sense disambiguation. 
Besides the processing is comparatively easy 
even in the early stage. 
4.4 Chinese verb aspect processing 
The verb aspect in Chinese is different from that 
in English. In general, by using Chinese aspects, 
we add some procedural tune to a verb rather 
than relating to time. In other words Chinese 
verb aspects give hints of the developmental 
phases or results, or the capability or possibility 
of the events. Chinese verb aspects are expressed 
by the aspect markers, such as simple markers 
???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, 
??? and compound markers ????, ????, 
etc.  
Again let?s look at two pair of Chinese-to-
English MT translations. 
(6) ?????????????????
???? 
(a) To dry too much work, a person in-
deed dry However come. 
(b) The ones that should do have too 
much work, one can not really be dry. 
(c) I have too much work to do, I can 
hardly cope with it. 
 
(7) ??????????? 
(a) Said the girl spoke to cry. 
(b) The girl has cried saying. 
(c) The girl began to weep while talking. 
 
The messy translations tell us how serious the 
impairment of the translation will be if we fail to 
process the Chinese verb aspects. 
Table 2 shows the meanings conveyed by 
most Chinese aspect and its corresponding ?as-
pect markers? and examples. Finally, when 
speaking about Chinese aspect, one point we 
would like to invite readers? attention that dif-
ferent from the aspect of English. It is known 
that English aspect is usually closely related to 
tenses, for example, English verbs can be used in 
progressive aspect with various tenses, such as 
present progressive, progressive and future pro-
gressive tenses. However, Chinese aspects are 
related to the development of the event itself, but 
not related to the time when the event happens. 
5 Conclusion 
Is it time for Chinese NLP circle to rethink what 
we have actually achieved in the word segmen-
tation and consider some radical change? How 
much room left is there for the current trilogy to 
improve? We propose that we should have mor-
phological processing to replace the so-called 
word segmentation. We have designated new 
tasks for the processing. In addition, we hope 
that we should design and use a new evaluation 
method. The general idea of new evaluation is to 
use a post-segmentation, or post-morphological-
processing task, say, chunking, to evaluate, 
rather than the present method of isochronous 
self-testing.
