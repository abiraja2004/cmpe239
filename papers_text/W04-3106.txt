Abstract
Biomedical literature contains vital informa-
tion for the analysis and interpretation of ex-
periments in the biological sciences. Hu-
man reasoning is the primary method for ex-
tracting, synthesizing, and interpreting the re-
sults contained in the literature, yet the rate at
which publications are produced is exponen-
tial. With the advent of digital, full-text pub-
lication and increasing computational power,
automated techniques for knowledge discov-
ery and synthesis are being developed to assist
humans in making sense of growing literature
databases.
We investigate the use of ontological informa-
tion provided by the Medical Subject Head-
ings (MeSH) project to discover groupings
within a collection of medical literature stored
in PubMed. Vector representations of docu-
ments based on MeSH terms are presented. Re-
sults of agglomerative hierachical clustering on
two collections of biomedical literature, the Rat
Genome Database and Tourette?s Syndrome re-
lated research, suggest novel and understand-
able groupings are obtainable.
1 Introduction
In recent years the amount of online documents has
grown tremendously that poses challenges for informa-
tion retrieval from this vast collection. Text mining is the
application of techniques of machine learning in conjunc-
tion with natural language processing, information ex-
traction and algebraic/mathematical approaches to com-
putational information retrieval (Berry and Pottenger,
2003).
Two major subfields of text mining are document clas-
sification and document clustering. Document classifica-
tion is the automated assignment of textual data to groups
or classes. Supervised machine learning techniques, such
as neural networks or nearest neighbor classifiers, are of-
ten employed in document classification. Document clus-
tering identifies groups of similar documents based on
shared features, typically words contained in the docu-
ments. This differs from document classification in that
topic areas are unknown before clustering.
An important consideration for document classifica-
tion and document clustering is the representation of the
documents for analysis. Traditional approaches repre-
sent documents by extracting features from the full-text
contents of each document. These features may undergo
transformations such as weighting or dimension reduc-
tion with the goal of improving classification accuracy,
improving clustering quality, or data reduction.
Our goal is to explore Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH), a controlled vocabulary for describing medical
literature (National Library of Medicine, 2003), as fea-
tures for document representation. Exploring this use of
MeSH is important for two reasons. First, MeSH terms
are assigned to papers by trained indexers, thus many is-
sues involved with natural language processing may be
avoided. Second, insights gained with MeSH based rep-
resentations may be applied to other ontologies under de-
velopment such as the Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontol-
ogy Consortium, 2000).
In this paper, we focus on the interplay between MeSH
based representations and document clustering. Our ap-
plication of document clustering is to identify and sum-
marize potential topics within collections of medical lit-
erature. The outline of the rest of the paper is as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses methods for obtaining docu-
ment collections. Representations of documents, includ-
ing our proposed MeSH representations are described in
Section 3. Section 4 outlines the document clustering ap-
proach used in our study. Results from a comparative
study and an exploratory study are presented in Section 5.
Section 6 contains a survey of related work. Conclusions
and future opportunities are discussed in Section 7.

2 Document Collections
Collections of documents can be obtained by several
means. In the simplest situation, any sample of docu-
ments contained in PubMed can be obtained for the pur-
poses of document clustering. Such a sampling may pro-
vide insight into the whole of PubMed, but is most likely
not useful for specific text mining tasks.
A more useful approach for targeted text mining is to
build a query or collection of queries centered around a
concept. For example, in studying prostate cancer, the
query string prostate cancer is given to PubMed. The
documents matching the query for prostate cancer are
retrieved and processed for document clustering. The
identified clusters represent potential topics contained in
prostate cancer research. This approach has been used to
build concept profiles for several text mining tasks (Srini-
vasan and Wedemeyer, 2003; Srinivasan, to appear).
Other possible methods for obtaining document col-
lections exist as well. In obtaining documents for a
genome database, such as the Rat Genome Database
(RGD) (Twigger et al, 2002), human curators combine
queries of PubMed with an exhaustive reading of a lim-
ited number of journals. This may be viewed as another
form of a concept-based collection. In this case, however,
the collection captures several ill defined concepts; ones
that cannot be specified with a small number of PubMed
queries.
This investigation considers both methods of obtaining
document collections.
3 Document Representations
Representing documents for clustering and other text
mining tasks is a fundamental step in the knowledge dis-
covery process. The ability to derive useful information
from a document collection may be entirely determined
by the attributes used to describe the documents. A com-
monly used representation in text mining and information
retrieval is the vector representation. A summary of vec-
tor representations is presented below and refer the reader
to a text on information retrieval (Korfhage, 1997) for a
more detailed description.
Suppose D is a collection of documents and T =
{t1, t2, . . . , tn} is the collection of unique terms appear-
ing in at least one document in D. Obtaining T is typi-
cally accomplished by extracting individual words (e.g.,
characters between spaces) from the text (e.g. titles, ab-
stracts, and body) of each paper, although more sophisti-
cated parsing may occur. Individual words may be further
processed by stop word removal, the removal of words
without inherent meaning such as articles or pronouns,
and stemming, the removal of suffixes to extract only root
words. This term processing often generates better clas-
sification and information retrieval results.
Given T , a document d ? D is represented as a vector
vd = ?w1, w2, . . . , wm?, (1)
where wi is called the weight of term ti within docu-
ment d. Weights are defined based on specific application
needs.
Two examples of commonly used weighting schemes
are term frequency (TF) and term frequency inverse doc-
ument frequency (TFIDF). Let |ti| be the number of times
ti appears in a document d, |D| be the number of docu-
ments in the document collection, and ni be the number
of documents in D containing ti. The TF scheme is de-
fined by wi = |ti|. The TFIDF scheme is defined by
wi = |ti|/ log2(|D|/ni).
Consider a document collection D with term collec-
tion T = {cancer, diagnosis, medical, viral}. If a docu-
ment d contains three occurences of the term cancer, one
occurence of the term diagnosis, four occurences of the
term medical, and no occurences of the term viral. The
representation of d using TF weighting is
vd = ?3, 1, 4, 0?.
3.1 MeSH Representations
This investigation builds on the vector space representa-
tion of documents described above. Instead of obtaining
a term collection T from the full text of titles, abstracts,
or content of a paper, T is built from the MeSH assign-
ments for each document. A summary of MeSH is given
below.
Medical literature is indexed by MeSH terms by the
National Library of Medicine (NLM) for the purpose
of subject indexing and searching of journal articles in
PubMed (an online literature database that contains cita-
tions from more than 4,600 biomedical journals). MeSH
terms are assigned to medical literature by human index-
ers.
MeSH consists of two ontologies: descriptors or head-
ings are a collection of terms for primary themes or topics
contained in the literature; and qualifiers or subheadings
are terms combined with descriptors to indicate the spe-
cific aspect of a descriptor. Formally, a MeSH term is a
tuple (d, q) where d is a descriptor and q is a qualifier (q
may be empty if d is unqualified). There exist 21975 de-
scriptors and 83 qualifiers in the 2003 MeSH ontology,
which was used in this study.
Both descriptors and qualifiers are organized in di-
rected acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the parent of a de-
scriptor or qualifier is considered more general than the
term itself. A descriptor (or qualifier) may have multi-
ple parents, representing that the descriptor (or qualifier)
includes multiple concepts in the MeSH ontology simul-
taneously. For example, in the 2003 MeSH ontology, de-
scriptors have an average of approximately 1.8 parents.

Portions of the descriptor and qualifier ontologies are dis-
played in Figures 1 and 2.
In MeSH representations, weights are derived from the
structure of MeSH. Documents are represented as vec-
tors where the term collection T consists of descriptors
only, qualifiers only, or combined descriptors and quali-
fiers (this will be further referred to as the combined rep-
resentation). Weights are defined by
wi =
?
?
?
0 if term ti is not assigned
1 if term ti is inferred
2 if term ti is assigned
.
A term is inferred if one of its descendants in the MeSH
hierarchy is assigned, but the term itself is not assigned.
Consider d with the term Viremia assigned. The de-
scriptors only representation is
vd = ?0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0?,
where the columns correspond to Animal Diseases,
Bacterial Infections and Mycoses, Diseases, Infection,
Parasitic Diseases, Sepsis, Septicemia, Viral Diseases,
Viremia, and Zoonoses respectively. The relationship
between the MeSH hierarchy and the values assigned is
demonstrated in Figure 1. In essence, the DAG structure
is flattened, but allowable vectors for document represen-
tation are restricted to the structure imposed by MeSH.
4 Document Clustering
Many clustering algorithms have been proposed for doc-
ument clustering. In this study, AGNES (Kaufman and
Rousseeuw, 1990), an agglomerative hierarchical cluster-
ing algorithm, with average linking was employed. Using
this algorithm has two advantages for this study. First,
dendrograms, a visualization of the substructures con-
tained in a document collection, are produced. Second,
AGNES computes an agglomerative coefficient a. Let
md be the height at which d is first merged, and M is the
height of the final merge, then
a = mean
d?D
(
1 ?
md
M
)
.
Intuitively, the agglomerative coefficient measures the av-
erage similarity of d to the members of the first cluster
containing d, normalized to a [0, 1] range. For document
collections of approximately equal size, a larger a indi-
cates better clustering quality (Kaufman and Rousseeuw,
1990).
4.1 Dimension Reduction
The number of unique terms in document collection is
typically large (> 1000), resulting in very high dimen-
sional data. Dimension reduction is commonly employed
in text mining before further analysis.
Principal components analysis (PCA) and related ap-
proaches are methods for dimension reduction (Jolliffe,
1986). A full discussion of PCA is beyond the scope of
this paper. Several guidelines exist for PCA to determine
the number of dimensions to use. In this study, principal
components are selected in descending order until 25%
of the variation in the data is captured.
4.2 Document Similarity
Many clustering algorithms require a measure of similar-
ity between two documents be defined. Euclidean dis-
tance is one measure used in clustering applications. An-
other measure, used in information retrieval, is the cosine
measure (Korfhage, 1997), which measures similarity by
calculating the cosine of the angle between the vector rep-
resentation of two documents. Cosine distance is used in
this paper.
4.3 Cluster Identification and Summarization
For MeSH representations, clusters are identified and
summarized to find interesting groups in the document
collection. Individual clusters are identified by cutting
the dendrogram at different heights. The clusters are then
summarized by computing the cluster center, a vector
consisting of the mean term weights across constituent
documents, using the full dimensional representation.
Terms are ranked in descending order according to the
resulting mean weight.
5 Experiments and Results
Two document collections were analyzed using docu-
ment clustering: documents in RGD (Twigger et al,
2002), and documents retrieved by the PubMed query
?Tourette?s Syndrome.? Each data set is described in
more detail below.
The following procedure was employed for each col-
lection.
1. Documents are encoded in a vector representation.
The term collection T is derived from terms in ab-
stracts and titles, MeSH descriptors, MeSH qual-
ifiers, or a combination of MeSH descriptors and
qualifiers.
For full-text, terms from abstracts and titles were ob-
tained using rainbow with stop word removal and
stemming options (McCallum, 1996). TF weighting
was used.
For the MeSH descriptors and qualifiers, the assign-
ments were obtained from PubMed XML entries,
and inferring was determined by the 2003 MeSH.
2. PCA was performed on the represented documents,
and principal components capturing 25% of the data
variance were selected. The documents were pro-
jected onto the selected components.
3. The reduced dimension representation was clustered
by AGNES using average linking. The cosine dis-
tance measure was used for document similarity.
4. Clusters were identified and summarized.
Computations were performed using R version
1.7.1 (R Development Core Team, 2003). Clustering was
accomplished using the agnes function in the cluster
package. PCA calculations used the prcomp function in
the mva package.
5.1 Rat Genome Database
The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is a NIH (National
Institutes of Health) project developed at Medical Col-
lege of Wisconsin (MCW) whose main objective is to
collect, consolidate and integrate data generated from rat
research (Twigger et al, 2002). Rat is the dominant pre-
clinical model organism used to study human diseases in-
volving heart, lung, kidney, blood and vasculature, such
as hypertension and renal failure. Researchers at MCW
curate approximately 200 articles from 30 journals every
month. This is a small portion of the 1200 articles pub-
lished on rat research every month. The concepts embod-
ied by this document collection are ill defined. Several
conversations with the RGD curators resulted in no clear
specification of interests or search terms.

Table 1: Agglomerative coefficients from 20 bootstrap
samples.
A comparative study of full text (abstracts and titles),
MeSH descriptors, MeSH qualifiers, and a combined
MeSH descriptors and qualifiers representation was per-
formed. The document collection consists of 2713 pa-
pers. The term collection T for the full-text representa-
tion contained 17177 unique terms after stemming and
stop word removal; and for the MeSH representations,
T contained 5013 descriptors and 64 qualifiers. After
PCA, the number of principal components used for the
descriptors, qualifiers, combined, and full-text represen-
tations are 16, 2, 62, and 37 respectively.
The clustering quality of each representation was eval-
uated using 20 bootstrap samples (i.e., sampling with re-
placement) of size 2713 from the 2713 documents. Each
sample was represented and clustered. The resulting ag-
glomerative coefficients were tabulated (Table 1). To
show a significant difference in the agglomerative coef-
ficients obtained between MeSH representations and the
full-text representation, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, a
non-parametric version of the paired t-test, was applied.
The p-values in Table 2 indicate that each of the MeSH
representations are significantly different than the full-
text representation. By observing that larger agglomer-
ative coefficients indicate higher quality clustering, we
conclude that MeSH representations offer higher quality
clustering than the full-text representation.
The full text and combined MeSH representations are
further explored. Dendrograms for the full text represen-
tation (Figure 4) and combined representation (Figure 3)
show the structure of the document collection. The com-
bined representation results in two clearly distinct clus-

ters identified at height 1.0. Furthermore, the tree con-
tains several small and tight clusters at a low height, indi-
cating the existence of possible subconcepts. In contrast,
the resulting tree for the full text representation does not
reveal the same structure, suggesting subconcepts are not
clearly identified.
Depicted in Figures 5 and 6 are two dimensional scat-
terplots of the documents projected on the first two princi-
pal components of the combined representation and full-
text representation respectively. These plots also show
a structure with the descriptors and qualifiers represen-
tation, there are two distinguished clusters with few out-
liers. The two clusters in the dendrogram of the combined
representation correspond to the left and right groups
seen in the scatterplot.
Table 3 presents summary description of the clusters
found for the combined representation. Terms with a
weight > 0.5 are included. The summary describes the
two major groups of papers: one related to sequence and
molecular techniques; the other related to metabolism,
biochemical phenomena and physiology.
5.2 Tourette?s Syndrome
A second, exploratory study was performed on a docu-
ment collection about the disease Tourette?s Syndrome.

terized by motor and vocal tics and associated behavioral
abnormalities. Chromosomes 2, 7, 11, and 18 have been
implicated in causal effects of the disease (OMIM, 2003).
The collection was obtained using the query
?Tourette?s Syndrome? on PubMed, resulting in
2241 papers. The term collection for the combined
representation consists of 6524 MeSH descriptors and
76 MeSH qualifiers. Only 8 principal components were
required to capture 25% of the variance in the data set.
Figure 7 contains the resulting dendrogram. Three dis-
tinct clusters of documents exist at a height of 1.0. The
leftmost cluster in the tree could be split again at a height
of approximately 0.9. The clusters at lower heights are
not as tightly defined as those in the RGD study, indicat-
ing more diversity in the document contents.
Summaries of the three clusters are given in Table 4.
In all three clusters, terms associated with Tourettes Syn-
drome appear with a weight > 0.5 in the cluster center.
Documents in the left cluster appear to focus on the psy-
chology and diagnosis associated with the disease, dis-
cussing all age groups and genders. The middle clus-
ter consists of papers associated with the genetics and
physiopathological diagnosis of Tourette?s Syndrome. Of
particular interest is the lack of age and gender terms,
meaning the papers do not represent consistent themes in
ages or genders. Papers associated with drug therapy and
pharmacological studies comprise the right cluster, again
spanning all age groups and genders. It should be noted
that Tourette?s Syndrome patients show a therapeutic re-
sponse to Haloperidol (OMIM, 2003).
The three identified clusters are represented by 1, 2

scatterplot projected onto the first two principal compo-
nents. The scatterplot along the first two principal com-
ponents show a correspondence to the dendrogram: 1?s

6 Related Work
Srinivasan has extensively investigated the use of MeSH
for classification and text mining (Srinivasan, 2001; Ruiz
and Srinivasan, 2002; Srinivasan and Rindflesch, 2002;
Ruiz and Srinivasan, 2003; Srinivasan and Wedemeyer,
2003; Srinivasan, to appear). Of particular interest is the
work on concept profiles to provide targeted summaries
of document collections. In comparison to our work, con-
cept profiles provide a global insight into a document col-
lection, whereas document clustering can provide insight
into important groups within a document collection.
Document clustering of medical literature in full-text
representations has been used for functional annotation
of gene products (Renner and Aszo?di, 2000) and concept
discovery (Iliopoulos et al, 2001). In the latter paper, the
authors ignore MeSH, arguing that it is not updated or
may not capture the document contents. In our study, we
found MeSH indexed documents without abstracts, sug-
gesting that clustering with MeSH terms is complemen-
tary work. MeSH descriptors have been considered as ad-
ditional features in document clustering (Wilbur, 2002),
but the hierarchical relationships of MeSH are not used.
Ontology-based clustering has been considered (Hotho
et al, 2001). In this work, terms are selected from the
ontology based on frequency, employing the parent-child
relationships. Adapting this work to MeSH may be inter-

esting.
A distance measure using MeSH has been introduced
as part of an algorithm to assign MeSH terms (Ontrup et
al., 2003). The distance measure considers a tree based
representation; the tree induced by assigned MeSH terms.
To overcome combinatorial issues, representative sub-
trees are constructed. Distance is measured via comple-
ments and overlaps of representative subtrees.
Transitive relationships between genes and disease
with MeSH terms have also been explored (Hristovski
and Peterlin, 2002; Perez-Iratxeta et al, 2002), using as-
sociation rules and fuzzy logic models, respectively.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
The presented results indicate that MeSH representations
are useful for document clustering. MeSH representa-
tions provide better quality AGNES clustering than full
text representations using TF weighting. Furthermore,
clusters are easily summarized and the summaries can be
readily interpreted in the context of the document collec-
tion.
It is quite surprising that using principal components
covering only 25% of the variance provides such obvious
structure. Even the first two principal components elicits
structure in the two document collections tested here.
Many directions exist for improving MeSH represen-
tation. The representations may lose information em-
bedded in the DAGs, since relationship between descrip-
tors (or qualifiers) and their parents are not strictly main-
tained. Explicit associations between qualifiers and de-
scriptors were removed to simplify representation; these
should be reintroduced. MeSH ?major themes?, an anno-
tation indicating emphasis on a term, remains to be incor-

porated.
The summarization approach is straightforward, but
presents terms that are not insightful. For example, Rats
is frequently a term with high ranking, bus is not informa-
tive in the RGD context. Similar observations have been
previously made (Kankar et al, 2002). Term weighting
and more flexibility in summarization should help.
MeSH representations have disadvantages compared
to full text. The manual curation process requires several
weeks for indexing. Yearly revision of MeSH implies
systems must adapt to changes. Full text in abstracts and
papers contain more precise information. We feel, how-
ever, that combining ontology and full text representa-
tions should be beneficial.
