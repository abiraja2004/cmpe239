FrameNet is a three-year NSF-supported 
project in corpus-based computational lexicog- 
raphy, now in its second year (NSF IRI-9618838, 
"Tools for Lexicon Building"). The project's 
key features are (a) a commitment to corpus 
evidence for semantic and syntactic generaliza- 
tions, and (b) the representation f the valences 
of its target words (mostly nouns, adjectives, 
and verbs) in which the semantic portion makes 
use of frame semantics. The resulting database 
will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic 
frames underlying the meanings of the words de- 
scribed, and (b) the valence representation (se- 
mantic and syntactic) of several thousand words 
and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a repre- 
sentative collection of annotated corpus attes- 
tations, which jointly exemplify the observed 
linkings between "frame elements" and their 
syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical func- 
tion, phrase type, and other syntactic traits). 
This report will present he project's goals and 
workflow, and information about the computa- 
tional tools that have been adapted or created 
in-house for this work. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
The Berkeley FrameNet project 1 is producing 
frame-semantic descriptions of several thousand 
English lexical items and backing up these de- 
scriptions with semantically annotated attesta- 
tions from contemporary English corpora 2. 
1The project is based at the International Computer 
Science Institute (1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA). A 
fuller bibliography may be found in (Lowe et ai., 1997) 
2Our main corpus is the British National Corpus. 
We have access to it through the courtesy of Oxford 
University Press; the POS-tagged and lemmatized ver- 
sion we use was prepared by the Institut flit Maschinelle 
Sprachverarbeitung of the University of Stuttgart). The 
These descriptions are based on hand-tagged 
semantic annotations of example sentences ex- 
tracted from large text corpora and systematic 
analysis of the semantic patterns they exem- 
plify by lexicographers and linguists. The pri- 
mary emphasis of the project therefore is the 
encoding, by humans, of semantic knowledge 
in machine-readable form. The intuition of the 
lexicographers is guided by and constrained by 
the results of corpus-based research using high- 
performance software tools. 
The semantic domains to be covered are" 
HEALTH CARE, CHANCE, PERCEPTION, COMMU- 
NICATION, TRANSACTION, TIME, SPACE, BODY 
(parts and functions of the body), MOTION, LIFE 
STAGES, SOCIAL CONTEXT, EMOTION and COG- 
NITION. 
1.1 Scope of the Pro ject  
The results of the project are (a) a lexical re- 
source, called the FrameNet database 3, and (b) 
associated software tools. The database has 
three major components (described in more de- 
tail below: 
? Lexicon containing entries which are com- 
posed of: (a) some conventional dictionary-type 
data, mainly for the sake of human readers; (b) FOR- 
MULAS which capture the morphosyntactic ways in 
which elements ofthe semantic frame can be realized 
within the phrases or sentences built up around the 
word; (c) links to semantically ANNOTATED EXAM- 
European collaborators whose participation has made 
this possible are Sue Atkins, Oxford University Press, 
and Ulrich Held, IMS-Stuttgart. 
SThe database will ultimately contain at least 5,000 
lexical entries together with a parallel annotated cor- 
pus, these in formats suitable for integration into appli- 
cations which use other lexical resources such as Word- 
Net and COMLEX.  The final design of the database will 
be selected in consultation with colleagues at Princeton 
(WordNet), ICSI, and IMS, and with other members of 
the NLP  community.

PLE SENTENCES which illustrate ach of the poten- 
tial realization patterns identified in the formula; 4
and (d) links to the FRAME DATABASE and to other 
machine-readable resources uch as WordNet and 
COMLEX. 
? Frame Database containing descriptions of 
each frame's basic conceptual structure and giving 
names and descriptions for the elements which par- 
ticipate in such structures. Several related entries in 
this database are schematized in Fig. 1. 
? Annotated Example Sentences which are 
marked up to exemplify the semantic and morpho- 
syntactic properties of the lexical items. (Several 
of these are schematized in Fig. 2). These sentences 
provide mpirical support for the lexicographic anal- 
ysis provided in the frame database and lexicon en- 
tries. 
These three components form a highly rela- 
tional and tightly integrated whole: elements 
in each may point to elements in the other 
two. The database will also contain estimates 
of the relative frequency of senses and comple- 
mentation patterns calculated by matching the 
senses and patterns in the hand-tagged exam- 
ples against the entire BNC corpus. 
1.2 Conceptua l  Mode l  
The FrameNet work is in some ways similar 
to efforts to describe the argument structures 
of lexical items in terms of case-roles or theta- 
roles, 5 but in FrameNet, the role names (called 
f rame e lements  or FEs)  are local to particular 
conceptual structures (frames);  some of these 
are quite general, while others are specific to a 
small family of lexical items. 
For example, the TRANSPORTATION frame, 
within the domain of MOTION, provides 
MOVERS, MEANS of transportation, and PATHS; 6 
4In cases of accidental gaps, clearly marked invented 
examples may be added. 
5The semantic frames for individual lexical units are 
typically "blends" of more than one basic frame; from 
our point of view, the so-called "linking" patterns pro- 
posed in LFG, HPSG, and Construction Grammar, op- 
erate on higher-level frames of action (giving agent, pa- 
tient, instrument), motion and location (giving theme, 
location, source, goal, path), and experience (giving ex- 
periencer, stimulus, content), etc. In some but not all 
cases, the assignment ofsyntactic orrelates to frame el- 
ements could be mediated by mapping them to the roles 
of one of the more abstract frames. 
8A detailed study of motion predicates would require 
a finer-grained analysis of the Path element, separating 
out Source and Goal, and perhaps Direction and Area, 
but for a basic study of the transportation predicates 
such refined analysis is not necessary. In any case, our 
subframes associated with individual words in- 
herit all of these while possibly adding some of 
their own. Fig. 1 shows some of the subframes, 
as discussed below. 
fra~ne (TRANSPORTATION) 
frame.elements(MOVER(S), MEANS, PATH) 
scene(MOVER(S) move along PATH by MEANS) 
frame(DRiVING) 
inherit (TRANSPORTATION) 
frarne.elements(DRIVER (:MOVER), VEHICLE 
(:MEANS), RIDER(S) (:MOVER(S)), CARGO 
(=MOVER(S))) 
scenes(DRIVER starts VEHICLE, DRIVER con- 
trois VEHICLE, DRIVER stops VEHICLE) 
frame(RIDING-i) 
inherit (TRANSP O RTATION) 
frame.elements(RIDER(S) (=MOVER(S)), VE- 
HICLE (:MEANS)) 
scenes(RIDER enters VEHICLE, 
VEHICLE carries RIDER along PATH, 
RIDER leaves VEHICLE ) 
Figure 1: A subframe can inherit elements and 
semantics from its parent 
The DRIVING frame, for example, specifies a 
DRIVER (a principal MOVER), a VEHICLE (a par- 
ticularization of the MEANS element), and po- 
tentially CARGO or RIDER as secondary movers. 
In this frame, the DRIVER initiates and controls 
the movement of the VEHICLE. For most verbs 
in this frame, DRIVER or VEHICLE can be real- 
ized as subjects; VEHICLE, RIDER, or CARGO can 
appear as direct objects; and PATH and VEHICLE 
can appear as oblique complements. 
Some combinations of frame elements, or 
F rame E lement  Groups  (FEGs) ,  for some 
real corpus sentences in the DRIVING frame are 
shown in Fig. 2. 
A RIDING_I frame has the primary mover role 
as RIDER, and allows as VEHICLE those driven 
by others/  In grammatical realizations of this 
frame, the RIDER can be the subject; the VEHI- 
CLE can appear as a direct object or an oblique 
complement; and the PATH is generally realized 
as an oblique. 
The FrameNet entry for each of these verbs 
will include a concise formula for all seman- 
work includes the separate analysis of the flame seman- 
tics of directional and locational expressions. 
7A separate frame RIDING_2 that applies to the En- 
glish verb r/de selects means of transportation that can 
be straddled, such as bicycles, motorcycles, and horses.

tic and syntactic ombinatorial possibilities, to- 
gether with a collection of annotated corpus en- 
tences in which each possibility is exemplified. 
The syntactic positions considered relevant for 
lexicographic description include those that are 
internal to the maximal projection of the target 
word (the whole VP, AP, or NP for target V, A 
or N), and those that are external to the max- 
imal projection under precise structural condi- 
tions; the subject, in the case of VP, and the 
subject of support verbs in the case of AP and 
NP. s 
Used in NLP, the FrameNet database should 
make it possible for a system which finds a 
valence-bearing lexical item in a text to know 
(for each of its senses) where its individual argu- 
ments are likely to be found. For example, once 
a parser has found the verb drive and its direct 
object NP, the link to the DRIVING frame will 
suggest some semantics for that NP, e.g. that 
a person as direct object probably represents 
the RIDER, while a non-human proper noun is 
probably the VEHICLE. 
For practical lexicography, the contribution of 
the FrameNet database will be its presentation

of the full range of use possibilities for individ- 
ual words, documented with corpus data, the 
model examples for each use, and the statistical 
information on relative frequency. 
2 Organ izat ion  and  Work f low 
2.1 Overv iew 
The computational side of the FrameNet project 
is directed at efficiently capturing human in- 
sights into semantic structure. The majority 
of the work involved is marking text with se- 
mantic tags, specifying (again by hand) the 
structure of the frames to be treated, and writ- 
ing dictionary-style entries based the results of 
annotation and a priori descriptions. With 
the exception of the example sentence xtrac- 
tion component, all the software modules are 
highly interactive and have substantial user in- 
terface requirements. Most of this functionality 
is provided by WWW-based programs written 
in PERL. 
Four processing steps are required produce 
the FrameNet database of frame semantic rep- 
resentations: (a) generating initial descriptions 
of semantic and syntactic patterns for use in 
corpus queries and annotation ("Preparation"), 
(b) extracting ood example sentences ("Sub- 
corpus Extraction"), (c) marking (by hand) the 
constituents of interest ("Annotation"), and (d) 
building a database of lexical semantic represen- 
tations based on the annotations and other data 
("Entry Writing"). These are discussed briefly 
below and shown in Fig. 3. 
2.2 Workf low and Personne l  
As work on the project has progressed, we 
have defined several explicit roles which project 
participants play in the various steps, these 
roles are referred to as Vanguard  (1.1 in 
Fig. 3), Annotators  (3.1) and Rearguard  
(4.1). These are purely functional designations: 
the same person may play different roles at dif- 
ferent times. 9
1. P reparat ion .  The Vanguard (1.1) pre- 
pares the initial descriptions of frames, includ- 
ing lists of frames and frame elements, and adds 
these to the Frame Database (5.1) using the 
Frame Description tool (1.2). The Vanguard 
90f course there are other staff members who write 
code and maintain the databases. This behind-the- 
scenes work is not shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Workflow, Roles, Data Structures and Software 
also selects the major vocabulary items for the 
frame (the target words) and the syntactic pat- 
terns that need to be checked for each word, 
which are entered in the Lexical Database (5.2) 
by means of the Lexical Database Tool (1.3). 
2. Subcorpus Extraction. Based on 
the Vanguard's work, the subcorpus extraction 
tools (2.2) produce a representative collection of 
sentences containing these words. 
This selection of examples i achieved through 
a hybrid process partially controlled by the pre- 
liminary lexical description of each lemma. Sen- 
tences containing the lemma re extracted from 
from a corpus and classified into subcorpora 
by syntactic pattern (2.2.1) using a CASCADE 
FILTER (2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.6) representing a par- 
tial regular-expression grammar of English over 
part-of-speech tags (cf. Gahl (forthcoming)), 
formatted for annotation (2.2.4) , and automat- 
ically sampled (2.2.3) down to an appropriate 
number. 
(If these heuristics fail to find appropriate 
examples by means of syntactic patterns, sen- 
tences are selected using INTERACTIVE SELEC- 
TION TOOLS (2.3)). 
3. Annotat ion.  Using the annotation soft- 
ware (3.2) and the tagsets (3.2.1) derived from 
the Frame Database, the Annotators (3.1) mark 
selected constituents in the extracted subcor- 
pora according to the frame elements which 
they realize, and identify canonical examples, 
novel patterns, and problem sentences. 1? 
4. Entry  Writing. The Rearguard (4.1) 
reviews the skeletal exical record created by 
the Vanguard, the annotated example sentences 
(5.3), and the FEGs extracted from them, and 
builds both the entries for the lemmas in the 
Lexical Database (5.2) and the frame descrip- 
tions in the Frame Database (5.1), using the 
Entry Writing Tools (4.2). 
l?We are building a "constituent type identifier" which 
will semi-automatically assign Grammatical Function 
(GF), and Phrase Type (PT) attributes to these FE- 
marked constituents, eliminating the need for Annota- 
tors to mark these.

3 Implementat ion  
3.1 Data  Mode l  
The data structures described above are im- 
plemented in SGML. n Each is described by a 
DTD, and these DTDs are structured to provide 
the necessary links between the components. 
3.2 Sof tware  
The software suite currently supporting 
database development is an aggregate of 
existing software tools held together with 
PERL/CGI-based "glue". In order to get the 
project started, we have depended on off-the- 
shelf software which in some cases is not ideal 
for our purposes. Nevertheless, using these 
programs allowed us to get the project up and 
running within just a few months. We describe 
below in approximate order of application the 
programs used and their state of completion.

? CQP (2.2.1) is a high-performance Corpus 
Query Processor, developed at IMS Stuttgart (IMS, 
1997). The cascade filter, which partitions lemma- 
specific subcorpora by syntactic patterns, is built 
using a preprocessor (written in PERL, 2.2.2) which 
generates CQP's native query language. 
? XKWIC (2.3) is an X-window, interactive tool, 
also from IMS, which facilitates manipulating cor-

2.2.4) which wraps SGML tags around sentences,

text elements. Another program, "whittle" (2.2.3), 
combines ubcorpora in a preselected order, remov- 
ing very long and very short sentences, and sampling 
to reduce large subcorpora.

model, which appears to provide more flexibility while 
reducing complexity. Also, the FrameNet software isbe- 
ing developed on Unix, but we plan to provide cross- 
platform capabilities by making our tool suite web-based 
and XML-compatible. 
SGML files into HTML for convenient viewing on 
the web, etc. are being written in PERL. RCS main- 
tains version control over most files. 
4 Conc lus ion 
At the time of writing, there is something in 
place for each of the major software compo- 
nents, though in some cases these are little more 
than stubs or "toy" implementations. Nearly 
10,000 sentences exemplifying just under 200 
lemmas have been annotated; there are over 
20,000 frame element tokens marked in these 
example sentences. About a dozen frames have 
been specified, which refer to 47 named frame 
elements. Most of these annotations have been 
accomplished in the last few months since the 
software for corpus extraction, frame descrip- 
tion, and annotation became operational. We 
expect the inventory to increase rapidly. If the 
proportions cited hold constant as the Framenet 
database grows, the final database of 5,000 lex- 
ical units may contain 250,000 annotated sen- 
tences and over half a million tokens of frame 
elements.
