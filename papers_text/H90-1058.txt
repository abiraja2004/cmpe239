This session presented papers on a number of different 
approaches to improving speech recognition performance, 
developed and evaluated on the DARPA resource manage- 
ment speech database. The session began with a summary 
presentation of results by Dave PalletL Most systems per- 
form comparably, with word-level total error rates in the 
range of about 6 percent on the June 1990 RM2 speaker- 
independent test set. The best performance, 4.3 percent 
error, was achieved at CMU. 
BBN, in explonng training and speaker adaptation tech- 
niques, found that a large amount of speech from a few 
(12) speakers i effective for speaker-independent training, 
provided that the speakers' data are not pooled before train- 
ing. This technique facilitates rapid speaker adaptation and 
incremental increases in the training database. 
AT&T and CMU presented papers on exploration of 
enhanced acoustic features to improve recognition perfor- 
mance, with emphasis on higher-order differences in 
speech parameters. AT&T used multivariate Gaussian 
mixture models, while CMU expanded their discrete model 
to 4 codebooks. When a semi-continuous observation 
model was used in conjunction with these 4 codebooks, a 
combined total error rate reduction of 30 percent was ach- 
ieved, yielding 4.3 percent word error. 
MIT Lincoln Laboratory also demonstrated performance 
with a semi-continuous or tied mixture observation model, 
and introduced the "semiphone", a context-dependent 
phonetic model with the reduced time scope from the tradi- 
tional triphone, which promises significant reduction in 
number of models. 
SRI presented two papers, the first exploring training set 
issues and the second noise robustness. SRI found that 
speaker-independent r cognition performance ould be sig- 
nificantly improved (word error was reduced by 20 per- 
cen0 by tripling the size of the training data set with a large 
amount of data from a few (12) speakers. This supports the 
finding of BBN. SRI also were able to achieve significant 
performance improvement from separated sex-specific 
recognition models and from corrective training. 
SSI explored tree-structured MMI encoding and found 
slight improvement over traditional minimum distortion 
encoding. These results are preliminary, however, and er- 
ror rates were in general significantly higher than those for 
other systems.
