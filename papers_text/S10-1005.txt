Abstract
We describe the Argument Selection and
Coercion task for the SemEval-2010 eval-
uation exercise. This task involves char-
acterizing the type of compositional oper-
ation that exists between a predicate and
the arguments it selects. Specifically, the
goal is to identify whether the type that
a verb selects is satisfied directly by the
argument, or whether the argument must
change type to satisfy the verb typing. We
discuss the problem in detail, describe the
data preparation for the task, and analyze
the results of the submissions.
1 Introduction
In recent years, a number of annotation schemes
that encode semantic information have been de-
veloped and used to produce data sets for training
machine learning algorithms. Semantic markup
schemes that have focused on annotating entity
types and, more generally, word senses, have
been extended to include semantic relationships
between sentence elements, such as the seman-
tic role (or label) assigned to the argument by the
predicate (Palmer et al, 2005; Ruppenhofer et al,
2006; Kipper, 2005; Burchardt et al, 2006; Subi-
rats, 2004).
In this task, we take this one step further and
attempt to capture the ?compositional history? of
the argument selection relative to the predicate. In
particular, this task attempts to identify the oper-
ations of type adjustment induced by a predicate
over its arguments when they do not match its se-
lectional properties. The task is defined as fol-
lows: for each argument of a predicate, identify
whether the entity in that argument position satis-
fies the type expected by the predicate. If not, then
identify how the entity in that position satisfies the
typing expected by the predicate; that is, identify
the source and target types in a type-shifting or co-
ercion operation.
Consider the example below, where the verb re-
port normally selects for a human in subject po-
sition, as in (1a). Notice, however, that through
a metonymic interpretation, this constraint can be
violated, as demonstrated in (1b).
(1) a. John reported in late from Washington.
b. Washington reported in late.
Neither the surface annotation of entity extents
and types nor assigning semantic roles associated
with the predicate would reflect in this case a cru-
cial point: namely, that in order for the typing
requirements of the predicate to be satisfied, a
type coercion or a metonymy (Hobbs et al, 1993;
Pustejovsky, 1991; Nunberg, 1979; Egg, 2005)
has taken place.
The SemEval Metonymy task (Markert and Nis-
sim, 2007) was a good attempt to annotate such
metonymic relations over a larger data set. This
task involved two types with their metonymic
variants: categories-for-locations (e.g., place-
for-people) and categories-for-organizations (e.g.,
organization-for-members). One of the limitations
of this approach, however, is that while appropri-
ate for these specialized metonymy relations, the
annotation specification and resulting corpus are
not an informative guide for extending the annota-
tion of argument selection more broadly.
In fact, the metonymy example in (1) is an in-
stance of a much more pervasive phenomenon of
type shifting and coercion in argument selection.
For example, in (2) below, the sense annotation
for the verb enjoy should arguably assign similar
values to both (2a) and (2b).
27

(2) a. Mary enjoyed drinking her beer.
b. Mary enjoyed her beer.
The consequence of this is that under current sense
and role annotation strategies, the mapping to a
syntactic realization for a given sense is made
more complex, and is in fact perplexing for a clus-
tering or learning algorithm operating over subcat-
egorization types for the verb.
2 Methodology of Annotation
Before introducing the specifics of the argument
selection and coercion task, we will briefly review
our assumptions regarding the role of annotation
in computational linguistic systems.
We assume that the features we use for encoding
a specific linguistic phenomenon are rich enough
to capture the desired behavior. These linguistic
descriptions are typically distilled from extensive
theoretical modeling of the phenomenon. The de-
scriptions in turn form the basis for the annota-
tion values of the specification language, which
are themselves the features used in a development
cycle for training and testing a labeling algorithm
over a text. Finally, based on an analysis and eval-
uation of the performance of a system, the model
of the phenomenon may be revised.
We call this cycle of development the MATTER
methodology (Fig. 1):
Model: Structural descriptions provide theoretically in-
formed attributes derived from empirical observations
over the data;
Annotate: Annotation scheme assumes a feature set that en-
codes specific structural descriptions and properties of
the input data;
Train: Algorithm is trained over a corpus annotated with the
target feature set;
Test: Algorithm is tested against held-out data;
Evaluate: Standardized evaluation of results;
Revise: Revisit the model, annotation specification, or algo-
rithm, in order to make the annotation more robust and
reliable.
Some of the current and completed annotation ef-
forts that have undergone such a development cy-
cle include PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005), Nom-
Bank (Meyers et al, 2004), and TimeBank (Puste-
jovsky et al, 2005).
3 Task Description
The argument selection and coercion (ASC) task
involves identifying the selectional mechanism
used by the predicate over a particular argument.
1
For the purposes of this task, the possible relations
between the predicate and a given argument are re-
stricted to selection and coercion. In selection, the
argument NP satisfies the typing requirements of
the predicate, as in (3):
(3) a. The spokesman denied the statement (PROPOSI-
TION).
b. The child threw the stone (PHYSICAL OBJECT).
c. The audience didn?t believe the rumor (PROPOSI-
TION).
Coercion occurs when a type-shifting operation
must be performed on the complement NP in order
to satisfy selectional requirements of the predicate,
as in (4). Note that coercion operations may apply
to any argument position in a sentence, including
the subject, as seen in (4b). Coercion can also be
seen as an object of a proposition, as in (4c).
(4) a. The president denied the attack (EVENT? PROPO-
SITION).
b. The White House (LOCATION ? HUMAN) denied
this statement.
c. The Boston office called with an update (EVENT?
INFO).
In order to determine whether type-shifting has
taken place, the classification task must then in-
volve (1) identifying the verb sense and the asso-
ciated syntactic frame, (2) identifying selectional
requirements imposed by that verb sense on the
target argument, and (3) identifying the semantic
type of the target argument.
4 Resources and Corpus Development
We prepared the data for this task in two phases:
the data set construction phase and the annotation
phase (see Fig. 2). The first phase consisted of
(1) selecting the target verbs to be annotated and
compiling a sense inventory for each target, and
(2) data extraction and preprocessing. The pre-
pared data was then loaded into the annotation in-
terface. During the annotation phase, the annota-
tion judgments were entered into the database, and
an adjudicator resolved disagreements. The result-
ing database was then exported in an XML format.
1
This task is part of a larger effort to annotate text with
compositional operations (Pustejovsky et al, 2009).
28
Figure 2: Corpus Development Architecture
4.1 Data Set Construction Phase: English
For the English data set, the data construction
phase was combined with the annotation phase.
The data for the task was created using the fol-
lowing steps:
1. The verbs were selected by examining the data
from the BNC, using the Sketch Engine (Kilgar-
riff et al, 2004) as described in (Rumshisky and
Batiukova, 2008). Verbs that consistently im-
pose semantic typing on one of their arguments
in at least one of their senses (strongly coercive
verbs) were included into the final data set: ar-
rive (at), cancel, deny, finish, and hear.
2. Sense inventories were compiled for each verb,
with the senses mapped to OntoNotes (Pradhan
et al, 2007) whenever possible. For each sense,
a set of type templates was compiled using a
modification of the CPA technique (Hanks and
Pustejovsky, 2005; Pustejovsky et al, 2004):
every argument in the syntactic pattern asso-
ciated with a given sense was assigned a type
specification. Although a particular sense is
often compatible with more than one semantic
type for a given argument, this was never the
case in our data set, where no disjoint types
were tested. The coercive senses of the chosen
verbs were associated with the following type
templates:
a. Arrive (at), sense reach a destination or goal : HU-
MAN arrive at LOCATION
b. Cancel, sense call off : HUMAN cancel EVENT
c. Deny, sense state or maintain that something is un-
true: HUMAN deny PROPOSITION
d. Finish, sense complete an activity: HUMAN finish
EVENT
e. Hear, sense perceive physical sound : HUMAN hear
SOUND
We used a subset of semantic types from the
Brandeis Shallow Ontology (BSO), which is a
shallow hierarchy of types developed as a part
of the CPA effort (Hanks, 2009; Pustejovsky
et al, 2004; Rumshisky et al, 2006). Types
were selected for their prevalence in manually
identified selection context patterns developed
for several hundred English verbs. That is,
they capture common semantic distinctions as-
sociated with the selectional properties of many
verbs. The types used for annotation were:
ABSTRACT ENTITY, ANIMATE, ARTIFACT, ATTITUDE,
DOCUMENT,DRINK,EMOTION,ENTITY,EVENT, FOOD,
HUMAN,HUMAN GROUP, IDEA, INFORMATION, LOCA-
TION,OBLIGATION,ORGANIZATION, PATH, PHYSICAL
OBJECT, PROPERTY, PROPOSITION,RULE, SENSATION,
SOUND, SUBSTANCE, TIME PERIOD, VEHICLE
This set of types is purposefully shallow and
non-hierarchical. For example, HUMAN is a
subtype of both ANIMATE and PHYSICAL OB-
JECT, but annotators and system developers
were instructed to choose the most relevant type
(e.g., HUMAN) and to ignore inheritance.
3. A set of sentences was randomly extracted for
each target verb from the BNC (Burnard, 1995).
The extracted sentences were parsed automati-
cally, and the sentences organized according to
the grammatical relation the target verb was in-
volved in. Sentences were excluded from the set
if the target argument was expressed as anaphor,
or was not present in the sentence. The seman-
tic head for the target grammatical relation was
identified in each case.
4. Word sense disambiguation of the target predi-
cate was performed manually on each extracted
sentence, matching the target against the sense
inventory and the corresponding type templates
as described above. The appropriate senses
were then saved into the database along with the
associated type template.
5. The sentences containing coercive senses of the
target verbs were loaded into the Brandeis An-
notation Tool (Verhagen, 2010). Annotators
were presented with a list of sentences and
asked to determine whether the argument in
the specified grammatical relation to the target
belongs to the type associated with that sense
in the corresponding template. Disagreements
were resolved by adjudication.

EVENT?SOUND hear 24 26
DOCUMENT?EVENT finish 39 40
Table 1: Coercions in the English data set
6. To guarantee robustness of the data, two addi-
tional steps were taken. First, only the six most
recurrent coercion types were selected; these
are given in table 1. Preference was given to
cross-domain coercions, where the source and
the target types are not related ontologically.
Second, the distribution of selection and co-
ercion instances were skewed to increase the
number of coercions. The final English data set
contains about 30% coercions.
7. Finally, the data set was randomly split in half
into a training set and a test set. The training
data has 1032 instances, 311 of which are co-
ercions, and the test data has 1039 instances,
314 of which are coercions.
4.2 Data Set Construction Phase: Italian
In constructing the Italian data set, we adopted the
same methodology used for the English data set,
with the following differences:
1. The list of coercive verbs was selected by exam-
ining data from the ItWaC (Baroni and Kilgar-
riff, 2006) using the Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff
et al, 2004):
accusare ?accuse?, annunciare ?announce?, arrivare ?ar-
rive?, ascoltare ?listen?, avvisare ?inform?, chiamare
?call?, cominciare ?begin?, completare ?complete?, con-
cludere ?conclude?, contattare ?contact?, divorare ?de-
vour?, echeggiare ?echo?, finire ?finish?, informare ?in-
form?, interrompere ?interrupt?, leggere ?read?, raggiun-
gere ?reach?, recar(si) ?go to?, rimbombare ?resound?,
sentire ?hear?, udire ?hear?, visitare ?visit?.
2. The coercive senses of the chosen verbs were
associated with type templates, some of which
are listed listed below. Whenever possible,
senses and type templates were adapted from
the Italian Pattern Dictionary (Hanks and Jezek,
2007) and mapped to their SIMPLE equiva-
lents (Lenci et al, 2000).
a. arrivare, sense reach a location: HUMAN arriva
[prep] LOCATION
b. cominciare, sense initiate an undertaking: HUMAN
comincia EVENT
c. completare, sense finish an activity: HUMAN com-
pleta EVENT
d. udire, sense perceive a sound : HUMAN ode SOUND
e. visitare, sense visit a place: HUMAN visita LOCA-
TION
The following types were used to annotate
the Italian dataset:
ABSTRACT ENTITY, ANIMATE, ARTIFACT, ATTITUDE,
CONTAINER, DOCUMENT, DRINK, EMOTION, ENTITY,
EVENT, FOOD, HUMAN, HUMAN GROUP, IDEA, IN-
FORMATION, LIQUID, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION,
PHYSICAL OBJECT, PROPERTY, SENSATION, SOUND,
TIME PERIOD, VEHICLE
The annotators were provided with a set of def-
initions and examples of each type.
3. A set of sentences for each target verb was ex-
tracted and parsed from the PAROLE sottoin-
sieme corpus (Bindi et al, 2000). They were
skimmed to ensure that the final data set con-
tained a sufficient number of coercions, with
proportionally more selections than coercions.
Sentences were preselected to include instances
representing one of the chosen senses.
4. In order to exclude instances that may have been
wrongly selected, a judge performed word sense
disambiguation of the target predicate in the ex-
tracted sentences.
5. Annotators were presented with a list of sen-
tences and asked to determine the usual seman-
tic type associated with the argument in the
specified grammatical relation. Every sentence
was annotated by two annotators and one judge,
who resolved disagreements.
6. Some of the coercion types selected for Italian
were:
a. LOCATION? HUMAN (accusare, annunciare)
b. ARTIFACT? HUMAN (annunciare, avvisare)
c. EVENT? LOCATION (arrivare, raggiungere)
d. ARTIFACT? EVENT (cominciare, completare)
e. EVENT? DOCUMENT (leggere, divorare)
f. HUMAN? DOCUMENT (leggere, divorare)
g. EVENT? SOUND (ascoltare, echeggiare)
h. ARTIFACT? SOUND (ascoltare, echeggiare)
7. The Italian training data contained 1466 in-
stances, 381 of which are coercions; the test
data had 1463 instances, with 384 coercions.
5 Data Format
The test and training data were provided in XML.
The relation between the predicate (viewed as
a function) and its argument were represented
by composition link elements (CompLink), as
30
shown below. The test data differed from the train-
ing data in the omission of CompLink elements.
In case of coercion, there is a mismatch between
the source and the target types, and both types
need to be identified; e.g., The State Department
repeatedly denied the attack:
The State Department repeatedly
<SELECTOR sid="s1">denied</SELECTOR>
the <TARGET id="t1">attack</TARGET>.
<CompLink cid="cid1"
compType="COERCION"
selector_id="s1"
relatedToTarget="t1"
sourceType="EVENT"
targetType="PROPOSITION"/>
When the compositional operation is selection,
the source and target types must match; e.g., The
State Department repeatedly denied the statement:
The State Department repeatedly
<SELECTOR sid="s2">denied</SELECTOR>
the <TARGET id="t2">statement</TARGET>.
<CompLink cid="cid2"
compType="SELECTION"
selector_id="s2"
relatedToTarget="t2"
sourceType="PROPOSITION"
targetType="PROPOSITION"/>
6 Results & Analysis
We received only a single submission for the
ASC task. The UTDMet system was an SVM-
based system with features derived from two main
sources: a PageRank-style algorithm over Word-
Net hypernyms used to define semantic classes,
and statistics from a PropBank-style parse of some
8 million documents from the English Gigaword
corpus. The results, shown in Table 2, were
computed from confusion matrices constructed for
each of four classification tasks for the 1039 link
instances in the English test data: determination
of argument selection or coercion, identification of
the argument source type, identification of the ar-
gument target type, and the joint identification of
the source/target type pair.
Clearly, the UTDMet system did quite well at
this task. The one immediately noticeable outlier
is the macro-averaged precision for the joint type,
which reflects a small number of miscategoriza-
tions of rare types. For example, eliminating the
single miscategorized ARTIFACT-LOCATION link
in the submitted test data bumps this score up to
a respectable 94%. This large discrepancy can ex-
plained by the lack of any coercions with those
types in the gold-standard data.
Prec. Recall Averaging
Selection vs. 95 96 (macro)
Coercion: 96 96 (micro)
Source Type: 96 96 (macro)
96 96 (micro)
Target Type: 100 100 (both)
Joint Type: 86 95 (macro)
96 96 (micro)
Table 2: Results for the UTDMet submission.
In the absence of any other submissions, it is
difficult to provide a point of comparison for this
performance. However, we can provide a base-
line by taking each link to be a selection whose
source and target types are the most common type
(EVENT for the gold-standard English data). This
yields micro-averaged precision scores of 69% for
selection vs. coercion, 33% for source type iden-
tification, 37% for the target type identification,
and 22% for the joint type.
The performance of the UTDMet system sug-
gests that most of the type coercions were identifi-
able based largely on examination of lexical clues
associated with selection contexts. This is in fact
to be expected for the type coercions that were the
focus of the English data set. It will be interesting
to see how systems perform on the Italian data set
and an expanded corpus for English and Italian,
where more subtle and complex type exploitations
and manipulations are at play. These will hope-
fully be explored in future competitions.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have described the Argument Se-
lection and Coercion task for SemEval-2010. This
task involves identifying the relation between a
predicate and its argument as one that encodes
the compositional history of the selection process.
This allows us to distinguish surface forms that di-
rectly satisfy the selectional (type) requirements of
a predicate from those that are coerced in context.
We described some details of a specification lan-
guage for selection, the annotation task using this
specification to identify argument selection behav-
ior, and the preparation of the data for the task.
Finally, we analyzed the results of the task sub-
missions.
