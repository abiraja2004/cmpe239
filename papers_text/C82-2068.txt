(1) In  natura l  languages as we l l  as in  any o ther  s ign  
system code s igns  (semia) are  to be d i s t ingu ished  from ep i -  
semis (enunclatlve si6us). 
In artificial ("Info1~natlonal") systems signs are 
sub, so% to asymmetric dualism involving the necessity of eyn- 
ergy of semia in a comparatively insIEnlficant measure when 
compared with signs in natural languageso ' 
On the other hahd, a measure of assymetry may be 
established, for example, in some constituents of the tradlt- 
ional language of arithletlc where even the phenomenon of 
"double articulation" of signs is encountered, plemes funotion- 
Ing - to a limited extent - as pleremes or semlao 
On this ~ ocoasion.we rely on the Common definition of the 
term pleme as a constituting element of the expression, a 
sort of subsymbol, ~l~ment de l?expression (of. J. Pohl, 
23, 453-468)? A new definition of vleme is given on this 
occasion: pleme absolute, relative (semi-symbol),. 
The pleme const i tu t ing  the c ipher  (Number, quant i ty )

Grouped together  in to  o rgan ized  s t ruc tures ,  var iab le  
s~mbols can funct ion  as abst rac t  ep isemia  (e lementary  and 
complex),  and thus as e lementary  models,  on ly  fo r  an (adv ised)

We can imagine a number o f  log ica l  or  a r i thmet ica l  
languages which can operate  - each w i th  regard  to  a l l  o thers  
- as metala.nguages. At the  same t ime,  t rans la t ion  a lgor i thm 
may sometimes be ra ther  complex in  v iew of tyDo loz ica~ 
d i f fe rences  between such systems,  e ?g .  in  the  b ic ipher  ( two-  
f igure)  numeral nota t ion ,  syntact i ca l  synergy and l ine~ 
arrangement of  plemes are encountered in  a very  pro fuse  mea- 
sure  when compared to ,  fo r  example, the  dec imal  notat ion  
where the symbol O when p laced to the r ight  of  a f igure  
serves  to  mul t ip ly  i t  by 10.

plemes may have 6 permutat ions  (31 - 6) ,  4|  - 24, 5|  - 120, 
61 - 720, 10! = 3 628 000, but plemss as le t te rs  do not  
const i tu te  semia in  every  permutat ion ,  e .g ?  ae l ,  a le ,  ~ ,  
ela,  ~ .  le__Aa.
