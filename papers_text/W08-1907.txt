Abstract 
In this paper we propose a model for 
conceptual access to multilingual lexicon 
based on shared orthography. Our propo-
sal relies crucially on two facts: That both 
Chinese and Japanese conventionally use 
Chinese orthography in their respective 
writing systems, and that the Chinese 
orthography is anchored on a system of 
radical parts which encodes basic 
concepts. Each orthographic unit, called 
hanzi and kanji respectively, contains a 
radical which indicates the broad se-
mantic class of the meaning of that unit. 
Our study utilizes the homomorphism 
between the Chinese hanzi and Japanese 
kanji systems to ide1ntify bilingual word 
correspondences. We use bilingual dictio-
naries, including WordNet, to verify 
semantic relation between the cross-
lingual pairs. These bilingual pairs are 
then mapped to an ontology constructed 
based on relations to the relation between 
the meaning of each character and the

basic concept of their radical parts. The 
conceptual structure of the radical 
ontology is proposed as a model for 
simultaneous conceptual access to both 
languages. A study based on words 
containing characters composed of the 
??(mouth)? radical is given to illustrate 
the proposal and the actual model. The 
fact that this model works for two 
typologically very different languages 
and that the model contains generative 
lexicon like coersive links suggests that 
this model has the conceptual robustness 
to be applied to other languages. 
1 Motivation  
Computational conceptual access to multilingual 
lexicon can be achieved through the use of ontol-
ogy or WordNet as interlingual links. Some lan-
guages do conventionally encode semantic classi-
fication information, such as the linguistic system 
of classifiers or the orthographic system of cha-
racters. We attempt to make use of these implicit-
ly encoded linguistic knowledge for conceptual 
access to lexical information. 
On the other hand, even though ontology seems 
to be a natural choice for conceptual framework 
to access multilingual lexical information, there 
is no large-scale implementation nor is there any 
47
direct evidence for psychological reality of the 
frameworks of ontology. Hence, we hope that 
using a conventionalized semantic classification 
system will mitigate some of the problems and 
provide the constructed ontology some motiva-
tion since they are the shared and implicit con-
ceptual systems.  
2 Background  
2.1. Hanzi and kanji: Shared Orthography of 
Two Typologically Different Languages 
 
Chinese and Japanese are two typologically dif-
ferent languages sharing the same orthography 
since they both use Chinese characters in written 
text. What makes this sharing of orthography 
unique among languages in the world is that Chi-
nese characters (kanji in Japanese and hanzi in 
Chinese) explicitly encode information of seman-
tic classification (Xyu 121, Chou and Huang 
2005). This partially explains the process of Jap-
anese adopting Chinese orthography even though 
the two languages are not related. The adaptation 
is supposed to be based on meaning and not on 
cognates sharing some linguistic forms. Howev-
er, this meaning-based view of kanji/hanzi ortho-
graphy faces a great challenge given the fact that 
Japanese and Chinese form-meaning pair do not 
have strict one-to-one mapping. There are mean-
ings instantiated with different forms, as well as 
same forms representing different meanings. The 
character ? is one of most famous faux amis. It 
stands for ?hot soup? in Chinese and ?hot spring? 
in Japanese. In sum, these are two languages 
where their forms are supposed to be organized 
according to meanings, but show inconsistencies. 
 It is important to note that WordNet and 
the Chinese character orthography are not so dif-
ferent as they appear. WordNet assumes that 
there are some generalizations in how concepts 
are clustered and lexically organized in languages 
and propose an explicit lexical level representa-
tion framework which can be applied to all lan-
guages in the world. Chinese character orthogra-
phy intuited that there are some conceptual bases 
for how meanings are lexicalized and organized, 
hence devised a sub-lexical level representation 
to represent semantic clusters. Based on this ob-
servation, the study of cross-lingual homo-forms 
between Japanese and Chinese in the context of 
WordNet offers an unique window for different 
approaches to lexical conceptualization. Since 
Japanese and Chinese use the same character set 
with the same semantic primitives (i.e. radicals), 
we can compare their conceptual systems with 
the same atoms when there are variations in 
meanings of the same word-forms. When this is 
overlaid over WordNet, we get to compare the 
ontology of the two represent systems. 
 
2.2. Hantology and the Ontologization of the 
Semantic Classification of the Radicals 
 
The design of Hantology differs from other 
word-based ontology. A typical word-based on-
tology is WordNet which describes the different 
relations among synonyms. All of the relations 
among synonyms are based on the senses of 
words. Therefore, WordNet only needs to take 
senses into consideration. Hantology is more 
complicated than WordNet because it describes 
orthographic forms, pronunciations, senses, va-
riants, lexicalization, the spread of Chinese cha-
racters and Japanese kanji.This approach can sys-
tematically illustrate the development of Chinese 
writing system (Chou et al 2007). 
Hantology also provides mapping with Sinica 
BOW(Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological 
WordNet). Sinica BOW is a Chinese-English 
Ontology and have mapping with WordNet. 
Therefore, character-based and word-based 
ontologies are integrated to provide resources 
from character to word for Chinese language 
processing. 
 
Figure 1. The Mapping among Hantology,  
Sinica BOW and WordNet 
 
The structure of Hantology is divided into 
three parts: orthography, pronunciation, and 
lexicalization. 
The orthographic part of Hantology describes the 
structure of characters, the principles of 
formatting characters, the evolution of script,

ter- based ontology)

based ontology)

glyph expression, the relation of variant and the 
spread of Chinese characters. 
(1) The structure of characters describes the 
components of each hanzi/kanji, including 
semantic and phonetic symbols.  
(2) The principles of formatting Chinese 
characters encode the classification of the 
relation used to compose the character from its 
components: The pictographic characters were 
formed by reformatting the pictures of concrete 
objects. The ideographic (zhi3shi4, refer-event) 
characters are formed by abstract representation 
of an concept. The compound ideographic 
characters are formed by combining two (ore 
more) semantic symbols. The semantic-
phonetic (xing2sheng1) characters, representing 
over 90 percent of Chinese character, are 
formed by combining a semantic symbol and a 
phonetic symbol.  
(3) The evolution of script illustrates the 
different scripts of Chinese characters. The 
script is a kind of writing style. Because 
Chinese characters have been used for 
thousands years, the scripts have changed.The 
orthographic forms do not change with different 
scripts. Hantology provides Bronze, Lesser 
Seal, Kaishu scripts to illustrate evolution of 
Chinese scripts used from 3000 years ago.  
(4) Variants are the characters with different 
orthographic forms with identical pronunciation 
and meaning. For example, Chinese chara-
cters?and ?are variants. Variants relations are 
an important feature in Hantology, similar to 
WordNet synset relations. 
 (5) The contrasts between kanji and hanzi 
glyphs are also encoded. The Japanese language 
continues to evolve and change after the 
adoption of Chinese characters. Hence the kanji 
system includes both historical changes and 
cross-lingual variations. The kanji system has 
its own variants which are not necessarily the 
same set of variants in the hanzi system. Most 
of Chinese characters adopted by simplified 
kanji are the variants already used in Chinese. 
For example, ??? is a simplified kanji of tradi-
tional kanji ???. In addition, Chinese character 
??? is also the variant of Chinese charac-
ter???. So, ???and??? both are variants in 
Chinese and Japanese. But, some simplified 
kanji are not variants used in Chinese. For 
example, new kanji ??? is the variant of old 
kanji ??? in Japan. However, ??? is not the 
variant of ??? in Chinese.  
The second reason of the kanji orthographic 
form to to be changed is that Japanese not only 
adopted Chinese characters but also have created 
hundreds kanji known as Kokuji (??). Most 
Kokuji characters have only Japanese pronuncia-
tions. Some of Kokuji have been adopted in Chi-
nese. For example, Kokuji ???is also borrowed 
by Chinese. The meaning of ??? is the same both 
in Japanese and Chinese.  
 
3. Preliminaries: Orthography based 
Mapping of Chinese and Japanese Words 
3.1 EDR Japanese-English Dictionary 
The Japanese-English dictionary of EDR Elec-
tronic Dictionary is a machine-tractable dictio-
nary that contains the lexical knowledge of Japa-
nese and English.1It contains list of 165,695 Jap-
anese words (jwd) and each of their related in-
formation. 
In this experiment, the English synset, definition 
and the Part-of-Speech category (POS) of each 
jwd are used to determine the semantic relations. 
We assume that the concept, synonyms, near-
synonyms, and paraphrases are the synset of each 
jwd.In the case when there is no English defini-
tion for the word, we assume that there is no 
equivalent term in English, therefore we use the 
concept definition of the jwd as its definition. 
3.2 SinicaBow 
In the previous experiment, the CWN, which 
contains a list of 8,624 Chinese word (cwd) en-
tries, was used as the cwd data, however since 
the number of cwds was too small, many jwds 
were not mapped, even when there is actually a 
corresponding J-C word pairs exists. 
This time we adopt SinicaBow, which contains 
9,9642 entries, hoping to find more valid corres-
ponding J-C word pairs.In SinicaBow, each entry 
is a definition and it contains one or more cwds 
corresponds to the definition. 
In this experiment, the English synset, definition 
and the POS of each cwd are used to determine 
the semantic relations. 
3.3List of Kanji Variants 
List of 125 pairs of manually matched Chinese 
and Japanese characters with variant glyph forms 
provided by Kyoto University.

Some Japanese kanji and Chinese hanzi have 
identical property but have different font and Un-
icode.This resource contains list of Japanese kan-
ji and Chinese hanzi pairs that the kanji proper-
ties are exactly the same but the forms and the 
Unicode are different. 
During the mapping procedure, whenever a Japa-
nese kanji and a Chinese hanzi being compared 
are in the variant list and are the variants of each 
other, they are considered to be the identical han-
zi. 
3.4 Procedure 
3.4.1Kanji Mapping 
Each jwd is mapped to the corresponding cwd 
according to their kanji similarity.Such mapping 
pairs are divided in to the following three groups: 
(1) Identical Kanji Sequence Pairs, where the 
numbers of kanji in the jwd and cwd are identical 
and the nth characters in the two words are also 
identical.  
E.g. ?, ?? 
(2) Different Kanji Order Pairs, where the num-
bers of kanji in the jwd and cwd are identical, 
and the kanji appear in the two words are identic-
al, but the order is different.  
E.g.  Japanese  Chinese 
??   ?? 
??   ?? 
(3) Partially Identical Pairs, where at least half 
kanji in the shorter word matches with the part of 
the longer word.In the case when the shorter 
word has 4 or less kanji, 2 of the kanji have to be 
in the longer word.In the case when the shorter 
word is only 1 kanji, the pair is not consi-
dered.jwd matches with a kanji in the cwd.  
E.g.,  Japanese  Chinese 
???  ??? 
???? 
??? 
????? ?? 
    ??? 
etc? 
In the case no corresponding pair relation (one of 
the three groups explained above) is found for a 
jwd or a cwd, each word is classified to one of 
the following group 
(4) unmapped jwd is classified to an independent 
Japanese 
(5) unmapped cwd is classified to an independent 
Chinese 
J-C word pairs in such mapping groups are clas-
sified in the following manner: (1) A jwd and a 
cwd are compared.If the words are identical, then 
they are an identical kanji sequence pair.(2) If the 
pair is found to be not an identical kanji sequence 
pair, check if the pair has identical kanji in dif-
ferent order (equal length).If so, then they are a 
different kanji order pair.(3) If the pair is found 
to be not a different kanji order pair, then check 
the partial identity of the pair.Meanwhile, if they 
are partially identical (according to the characte-
ristics of partially identical pairs described 
above), the pair is classified to a partially identic-
al pair. 
 
After the mapping process, if the jwd is not 
mapped to any of the cwd, the jwd is classified to 
(4) independent Japanese group. If a cwd is not 
mapped by any of the jwd, it is classified to (5) 
independent Chinese group.

3.4.2Finding Synonymous Relation (Word Re-
lation) 
After the kanji mapping, each of (1) identical 
kanji sequence pairs, (2) different kanji order 
pairs and (3) partially identical pairs is divided 
into three subgroups;  
(1-1, 2-1, 3-1) Synonym pairs with identical 
POS: words in a pair are synonym with identical 
POS.  
E.g. (1-1) ??: singer (noun)  
(2-1) ??? (Japanese) and  
??? (Chinese):  
blue-violet color (noun) 
50
(3-1) ??? (Japanese) and  
??? (Chinese):  
brown sugar (noun) 
(1-2, 2-2, 3-2) Synonym pairs with unmatched 
POS: words in a pair are synonym with different 
POS or POS of at least one of the words in the 
pair is missing.  
E.g. (1-2) ?:  
(Japanese) action of wrapping (noun)  
(Chinese) to wrap (verb) 
(2-2) ?? (Japanese): a cough (noun) 
 ?? (Chinese): cough (verb) 
(1-3, 2-3, 3-3) Relation Unidentified: the relation 
is not determinable by machine processing with 
the given information at this point.  
E.g. Japanese  Chinese 
(1-3) ?: hot spring (noun) ?: soup (noun) 
(2-3) ??:    ??: flower 
arrangement (noun) peanut (noun) 
(3-3) ???:   ???:  
blue grapes (noun) Portugal (noun) 
In order to find the semantic relation of J-C word 
pairs by machine analysis, the jwd and the cwd in 
a pair are compared according to the following 
information: 
Jwd: English synset (jsyn), definition (jdef) and 
POS 
Cwd: English synset (csyn), definition (cdef) and 
POS 
The process of checking the synonymy of each 
pair is done in the following manner:  
If any of the following conditions meets, we as-
sume that the pair is a synonym pair:  
at least any one of the synonym from each of jsyn 
and csyn are identical 
at least one of the word definition contains a syn-
onym of the other word 
 
If any synonym pair was found, check if the POS 
are identical.If the POS are identical, the pair is 
classified to a synonym pair with identical 
POS.Otherwise the pair is classified to a syn-
onym pair with non-identical POS.If the pair is 
not a synonym pair then they are classified to a 
relation-unidentified pair. 
After the process, each of the subgroups is ma-
nually examined to check the actual semantic 
relations of each word pair. 
4. Result 
4.1 Word Family as Domain Ontology Headed 
by a Basic Concept 
Chinese radical (yi4fu2, ideographs; semantic 
symbols) system offers a unique opportunity for 
systematic and comprehensive comparison be-
tween formal and linguistic ontologies. Chou and 
Huang (2005) suggests that the family of Chinese 
characters sharing the same radical can be linked 
to a basic concept by Qualia relations. Based on 
Pustejovsky?s Quilia Structure [Pustejovsky, 
1995] and the original analysis of ?ShuoWen-
JieXi?[Xyu, 121], each radical group can be as 
domain ontology headed by one basic concept.  
 
Chou and Huang (2005) assume that 540 radicals 
in ?ShuoWenJieXi? can each represent a basic 
concept and that all derivative characters are 
conceptually dependent on that basic concept. 
Also, they hypothesis that a radical can be classi-
fied into six main types: formal, constitutive, tel-
ic, participating, descriptive (state, manner) and 
agentive. Modes of conceptual extension capture 
the generative nature of radical creativity. All 
derived characters are conceptually dependent on 
the basic concept. In their preliminary studies, 
word family could be headed by a basic concept 
and also could be represented ontologies in OWL 
format.

Since each entry in SinicaBow corresponds to a 
definition and each jwd has at least a definition 
or a concept definition, no pairs with insufficient 
information to check the semantic relation was 
found.The data shows that as the word forms of 
the two languages are closer, the more synonyms 
are found.In order to confirm this observation 
and to see the actual semantic relation of each 
pairs, we will continue with more detailed analy-
sis.In addition, in order to pursue the further de-
tails of the Japanese-Chinese words relation, we 
will also analyze the semantic relations (not only 
synonymous relation) of the relation-unidentified 
pairs. 
 
4.2.2 ??(mouth)?Analysis Procedure: 
 
In our experiment, we select the identical kanji 
Sequence Pairs (POS) as our main resources. 
Characters with the radical??(mouth)?are se-
lected. In addition, if any character of the words 
owns the radical ??(mouth)?, then it would be 
included here for anaylysing the detailed seman-
tic relation between jwd and cwd..  
 
Second, we would like to define the semantic 
relations of J-C word pairs in more details. We 
examined the actual semantic relation of J-C 
word pairs by by classifying into 8 semantic rela-
tions and marked the relation into [ ] remark.  
 
1.[SYN](Synonym) 
2.[NSN](Near-Synonym) 
3.[HYP](Hypernym) 
4.[HPO](Hyponym) 
5.[HOL](Holonym) 
6.[MER](Meronym) 
7.[/](No Corresponding Semantic Relation) 
8.[??](unable to decide) 
The pattern is as follows. 
[(JWD>jsyn>??>jdef>)-[Semantic Relation]-
(CWD)>csyn>??>cdef]] 
52
 
Sample: 
[(J)-[HYP]-(C)]@  
(J is the hypernym of C) 
 
The examples are shown here. In each pair, we 
define the semantic relation between the jwd and 
the cwd. The mapping process would be as fol-
lows.  
 
E.g  
1. [(?> JWD0028646> N> a condition of being in-
capable of speaking using the voice> )-[SYN]-(?> 
10137481N> N> paralysis of the vocal cords resulting 
in an inability to speak> alalia,)]@ 
2. [(?> JWD0378514> N> of a bird, a bill> bill)-
[SYN]-(?> 01278388N> N> horny projecting jaws 
of a bird> nib,neb,bill,beak,)]@ 
3. [(??> JWD0161758> N> part of an animal called 
a throat> )-[SYN]-(??> 04296952N> N> the pas-
sage to the stomach and lungs; in the front part of the 
neck below the chin and above the collarbone> pha-
rynx,throat,)]@ 
4. [(???> JWD0398785> N> a bird that is related 
to the picidae, called woodpecker> woodpecker)-
[SYN]-(???> 01355454N> N> bird with strong 
claws and a stiff tail adapted for climbing and a hard 
chisel-like bill for boring into wood for insects> 
woodpecker,)]@ 
5. [(?????> JWD0401642> N> a medical in-
strument with which a patient can breathe artificially> 
respirator)-[SYN]-(?????> 03233384N> N> a 
device for administering long-term artificial respira-
tion> inhalator,respirator,)]@ 
 
According to our observation, we notice that 
most of the Japanese kanji can get their syn-
onyms or near-synonyms in Chinese hanzi and 
the percentage for this relation is about 63 % in 
characters with the radical??(mouth) selected 
from Identical Synonym POS data. Please refer

4.3 Conceptual Access: A Preliminary Model 
 
In this part, we try to apply dimension of concep-
tual extension of ??(mouth)? radical into the data 
we have chosen from the Identical Synonym POS 
data comparing with Japanese kanji and Chinese 
hanzi.(Please refer to the Appendix A.) A study 
based on words containing characters composed 
of the ??(mouth) ? radical is given for illustration 
in this preliminary study. It shows that the con-
ceptual robustness can also be applied to other 
languages, such as Japanese kanji.

5. Conclusion 
 
Appendix A. The Dimension of ?? 
(mouth) Conceptual extension?. 
The result of the experiment comparing the Japa-
nese and Chinese words is to see their form-
meaning similarities.Since the Japanese and the 
Chinese writing system (kanji) and its semantic 
meanings are near-related, analyzing such rela-
tion may contribute to the future research related 
to Hantology.In this paper, we examine and ana-
lyze the form of kanji and the semantic relations 
between Japanese and Chinese.This paper de-
scribes the structure of Hantology which is a cha-
racter-based bilingual ontology for Chinese and 
Japanese. Hantology represents orthographic 
forms, pronunciations, senses, variants, lexicali-
zation, the spread and relation between Chinese 
characters and Japanese kanji. The results show 
Hantology has two implications. First, Hantology 
provides the resources needed by Chinese lan-
guage processing for computers.Second, Hantol-
ogy provides a platform to analyze the variation 
and comparison of Chinese characters and kanji 
use.
