OVERVIEW: Naturalistic two-medium communication with a computational system, using both 
language and interactive graphics (Cohen, 1991; Maier, 1993; McKeown, 1993), is an important 
practical complement to studies that involve only language, only graphics and/or only people. 
Integrative two-medium work should build on insights and findings in the one-medium disciplines 
of graphical manipulative interfaces (e.g., Hutchins et al, 1986; Sullivan and Tyler, 1991) and 
natural language discourse (e.g., Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1987; Hovy, 1988; 
Lambert and Carberry, 1991; Paris, 1991). 
In addition to its general use with a variety of systems, two-medium communication provides an 
essential foundation for a pedagogically important form of foreign language l arning experience 
(Hamburger and Hashim, 1992). Specifically, it permits a supportive dialog practice system for 
naturalistic acquisition of various language aspects, by combining discourse constraints with 
independently comprehensible situational contexts. By factoring out and gaining control of the 
types of dialog interactions, the various ituational nd object viewpoints, the choice of domain and 
the intradomain events, we are attempting toprovide the tools for a workable tutorial strategy, one 
that will resolve the competing requirements of conversational continuity and appropriate language 
challenge (Hamburger and Maney, 1991). Finally, to indicate the potentially broader applicability 
of this approach, we sketch the implementation f two-medium communication for learning 
environments with non-language subject matter (Hashim and Hamburger, 1993). 
Our second-generation c versational foreign language tutor, FLUENT-2, takes a generative 
(recombinative) approach to dialog management. We thereby dramatically enhance the linguistic 
range of the tutor over the earlier, less flexible FLUENT- 1, yet continue to impose conversational 
continuity on the tightly integrated linguistic and spatial communication between student and tutor. 
The keys to this approach are dialog schemas built from interaction types and situation viewpoints 
that relate to the objects, states, actions and plan structures of the microworlds that underlie the 
conversation. The NLP (Felshin, 1993), graphics, microworlds and tutorial reasoning are all in 
MCL2 Common Lisp with CLOS on a Mac-Ilfx with 20M main memory. Dialog structuring work 
done in Prolog (Hashim and Hamburger, 1992) is being adapted by recoding and use of a Prolog- 
in-Lisp interpreter (Norvig, 1992). 
INTERACTION TYPES FOR DIALOG SCHEMAS: The simplest interaction types 
consist of one linguistic or spatial move by the student or tutor and then one by the other of them. 
We have identified nine pedagogically useful types for language learning, listed below, each 
involving language use in one or both of its two moves. The names, initially a convenient 
shorthand for the tutor's role, evoke motivationally useful tutor personality raits (Murray, 1987; 
1992); in each specification, S = student and T = tutor: 
27 
1. Tourguide 
2. Commander 
3. Narrator 
4. Celebrity 
5. Quizmaster 
6. Movecaster 
7. Oracle 
8. Servant 
9. Interpreter 
T acts and comments; S acknowledges 
T makes acommand; S executes it 
T says something; S enacts it
T acts; S tells about it 
T asks a question; S answers it
S acts; T describes it 
S asks a question; T answers it
S makes acommand; T executes it 
S says something; T enacts it 
More complex types are needed for language rrors and communication repair. The dialog 
schemas composed from these interaction types will differ depending on whether the student is to 
learn language or the subject matter of the microworld. Examples for the language case appear in 
Hashim and Hamburger (1992). 
Interaction types work jointly with domain-level p ans in the determination f the student's 
intentions. The plans place expectations onthe sequence ofactions and their esulting states, while 
the interaction types determine which agent is in control of the visual channel. Recognition of 
intentions leads in turn to the possibility of detecting the student's misunderstandings or 
misconceptions and repainng them. Spatial actions are implicitly associated with intentional 
structures, which the tutor may check for congruency with the currently active plan. For example, 
picking up an object ypically induces in the observer the belief that the picker intends to use it. 
When the recognized intentions depart from the expectations, the system planner chooses a
perspective (aview, see below) from which to deal with the misfit. In such a case, the realization 
of the tutor's turn may imply rhetorical cts such as drawing attention, arguing, suggesting. 
The following dialog (typical of FLUENT-1 and of what we are working on generatively in
FLUENT-2) uses this effect o detect and correct a misconception: 
TUTOR: 
STUDENT: 
TUTOR: 
Wash your face. 
<Picks up a box of detergent> 
That's the toothpaste. You can't wash your 
face with toothpaste. Pick up the soap instead. 
The same rhetorical structunng of the tutor's reply might result from violations of microworld 
constraints (Murray, 1987): 
TUTOR: That's a glass table. You can't put the box on it. 
The box is too heavy and the glass would break. 
From this point of view, this approach presents some similarities with the one taken by Maybury 
(1993). 
The presence of the extra, visual medium in a communication system has significant effects on the 
use of the language medium, notably in the handling of the discourse phenomenon f reference 
identification, where it may be unnecessary and even infelicitous to include certain information that 
is visually available. Consider this sequence: 
TUTOR: 
STUDENT: 
TUTOR: 
Pick up the red book. 
<Picks it up> 
The table is clear now. 
Here "the table" identifies the table that the red book was previously on, and which is visible. 
Suppose that another physically identical table is present, and consider the awkwardness of
28 
unnecessarily distinguishing them with a relative clause, thereby replacing the tutor's last comment 
with: 
TUTOR: The table from which you picked up the red book is 
clear now. 
These comments hinge on the visual availability of the relationship between the book and the table, 
which allows the two tables to be visually distinguished. If this exchange were to take place by 
telephone the conclusions would be different. 
SITUATION VIEWPOINTS: The situation viewpoints referred to above involve the 
important aspects of the various microworlds: plans, actions and the state of objects. Plans permit 
non-arbitrary choice of action when initiative falls to the tutor, as it does in types 1-5. Our plan 
executor can call for language generation attop level, at the intermediate level of subplans, or at the 
fine-grained level of individual actions. Reference to actions can treat hem as independent events 
or in relation to the (sub)plans containing them. In Movecaster, the student's unconstrained move 
can be described as an action or in terms of a resulting state or state change. The NPs in these 
descriptions can be made sensitive to various aspects of focus and specificity, thanks to the NLP 
software of the Athena Language Learning Project (Felshin, 1993). 
We have developed a list of approximately 40 views in eight categories that relate to actions, states, 
plans, temporality, thematic roles, correction, and, at the level of the noun phrase, reference 
specification for individuals and for collectivities. Various state views of an action, for example, 
include (i) the new state of the object acted upon, (ii) the fact that (some property of) its preceding 
state no longer holds, (iii) an indirect change in a related object (such as a shelf being empty as a 
result of an object being picked up), (iv) an unchanged attribute of the object acted on. The earlier 
discussion of intentions i to be implemented in terms of such correction views. Two such views 
are (i) action disallowed because of unsatisfied precondition and (ii) some preconditions ok, but 
consequence is unwanted. 
NON-LANGUAGE DOMAIN: We have extended our approach by implementing, in Prolog, 
a natural interface for a tutoring system in a domain outside of natural language (Hashim and 
Hamburger, 1993). By a natural interface, we mean one that provides readily grasped conventions 
for interactive graphics along with plan-based natural language xplanations. We transport the 
FLUENT techniques toCoinland, atutoring and learning environment for constrained xploration 
of problems in arithmetic. Coinland has a single microworld, one which is somewhat more 
abstract than those of FLUENT, both visually and conceptually. Like the FLUENT microworlds, 
Coinland represents an everyday situation, one in which coins can be moved around and 
exchanged for equal value (Hamburger and Lodgher, 1989). Here, instead of language, the 
student is to learn the domain, but there is still two-medium redundancy tosupport learning. We 
show how the system tutor can talk about the subtraction problem using a view processing 
mechanism and some of the views listed above. In Coinland, as in FLUENT, the familiarity of the 
objects and physical actions represented in the microworld, the clarity of the interface, and the use 
of redundancy ombine to make it possible for the student to pick up new knowledge in an active 
and natural way.
