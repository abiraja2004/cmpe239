Abstract
This paper describes the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems devel-
oped at RWTH Aachen University for
the translation task of the ACL 2013
Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT 2013). We partici-
pated in the evaluation campaign for the
French-English and German-English lan-
guage pairs in both translation directions.
Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT
systems are applied. A number of dif-
ferent techniques are evaluated, including
hierarchical phrase reordering, translation
model interpolation, domain adaptation
techniques, weighted phrase extraction,
word class language model, continuous
space language model and system combi-
nation. By application of these methods
we achieve considerable improvements
over the respective baseline systems.
1 Introduction
For the WMT 2013 shared translation task1
RWTH utilized state-of-the-art phrase-based and
hierarchical translation systems as well as an in-
house system combination framework. We give
a survey of these systems and the basic meth-
ods they implement in Section 2. For both
the French-English (Section 3) and the German-
English (Section 4) language pair, we investigate
several different advanced techniques. We con-
centrate on specific research directions for each
of the translation tasks and present the respec-
tive techniques along with the empirical results
they yield: For the French?English task (Sec-
tion 3.2), we apply a standard phrase-based sys-
tem with up to five language models including a
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/
translation-task.html
word class language model. In addition, we em-
ploy translation model interpolation and hierarchi-
cal phrase reordering. For the English?French
task (Section 3.1), we train translation mod-
els on different training data sets and augment
the phrase-based system with a hierarchical re-
ordering model, a word class language model,
a discriminative word lexicon and a insertion
and deletion model. For the German?English
(Section 4.3) and English?German (Section 4.4)
tasks, we utilize morpho-syntactic analysis to pre-
process the data (Section 4.1), domain-adaptation
(Section 4.2) and a hierarchical reordering model.
For the German?English task, an augmented hi-
erarchical phrase-based system is set up and we
rescore the phrase-based baseline with a continu-
ous space language model. Finally, we perform a
system combination.
2 Translation Systems
In this evaluation, we employ phrase-based trans-
lation and hierarchical phrase-based translation.
Both approaches are implemented in Jane (Vilar et
al., 2012; Wuebker et al, 2012), a statistical ma-
chine translation toolkit which has been developed
at RWTH Aachen University and is freely avail-
able for non-commercial use.2
2.1 Phrase-based System
In the phrase-based decoder (source cardinality
synchronous search, SCSS), we use the standard
set of models with phrase translation probabilities
and lexical smoothing in both directions, word and
phrase penalty, distance-based distortion model,
an n-gram target language model and three bi-
nary count features. Optional additional models
used in this evaluation are the hierarchical reorder-
ing model (HRM) (Galley and Manning, 2008), a
word class language model (WCLM) (Wuebker et
2http://www.hltpr.rwth-aachen.de/jane/
193
al., 2012), a discriminative word lexicon (DWL)
(Mauser et al, 2009), and insertion and deletion
models (IDM) (Huck and Ney, 2012). The param-
eter weights are optimized with minimum error
rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003). The optimiza-
tion criterion is BLEU.
2.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based System
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang,
2007), a weighted synchronous context-free gram-
mar is induced from parallel text. In addition to
continuous lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases
with up to two gaps are extracted. The search is
carried out with a parsing-based procedure. The
standard models integrated into our Jane hierar-
chical systems (Vilar et al, 2010; Huck et al,
2012c) are: phrase translation probabilities and
lexical smoothing probabilities in both translation
directions, word and phrase penalty, binary fea-
tures marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule, and
rules with non-terminals at the boundaries, four
binary count features, and an n-gram language
model. Optional additional models comprise IBM
model 1 (Brown et al, 1993), discriminative word
lexicon and triplet lexicon models (Mauser et al,
2009; Huck et al, 2011), discriminative reordering
extensions (Huck et al, 2012a), insertion and dele-
tion models (Huck and Ney, 2012), and several
syntactic enhancements like preference grammars
(Stein et al, 2010) and soft string-to-dependency
features (Peter et al, 2011). We utilize the cube
pruning algorithm for decoding (Huck et al, 2013)
and optimize the model weights with MERT. The
optimization criterion is BLEU.
2.3 System Combination
System combination is used to produce consensus
translations from multiple hypotheses generated
with different translation engines. First, a word
to word alignment for the given single system hy-
potheses is produced. In a second step a confusion
network is constructed. Then, the hypothesis with
the highest probability is extracted from this con-
fusion network. For the alignment procedure, one
of the given single system hypotheses is chosen as
primary system. To this primary system all other
hypotheses are aligned using the METEOR (Lavie
and Agarwal, 2007) alignment and thus the pri-
mary system defines the word order. Once the
alignment is given, the corresponding confusion
network is constructed. An example is given in
Figure 1.
The model weights of the system combination
are optimized with standard MERT on 100-best
lists. For each single system, a factor is added to
the log-linear framework of the system combina-
tion. Moreover, this log-linear model includes a
word penalty, a language model trained on the in-
put hypotheses, a binary feature which penalizes
word deletions in the confusion network and a pri-
mary feature which marks the system which pro-
vides the word order. The optimization criterion is
4BLEU-TER.
2.4 Other Tools and Techniques
We employ GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to train
word alignments. The two trained alignments are
heuristically merged to obtain a symmetrized word
alignment for phrase extraction. All language
models (LMs) are created with the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002) and are standard 4-gram LMs
with interpolated modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman,
1998). The Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning,
2003) is used to obtain parses of the training data
for the syntactic extensions of the hierarchical sys-
tem. We evaluate in truecase with BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2002) and TER (Snover et al, 2006).
2.5 Filtering of the Common Crawl Corpus
The new Common Crawl corpora contain a large
number of sentences that are not in the labelled
language. To clean these corpora, we first ex-
tracted a vocabulary from the other provided cor-
pora. Then, only sentences containing at least
70% word from the known vocabulary were kept.
In addition, we discarded sentences that contain
more words from target vocabulary than source
vocabulary on the source side. These heuristics
reduced the French-English Common Crawl cor-
pus by 5,1%. This filtering technique was also ap-
plied on the German-English version of the Com-
mon Crawl corpus.
3 French?English Setups
We trained phrase-based translation systems for
French?English and for English?French. Cor-
pus statistics for the French-English parallel data
are given in Table 1. The LMs are 4-grams trained
on the provided resources for the respective lan-
guage (Europarl, News Commentary, UN, 109,

3.1 Experimental Results English?French
For the English?French task, separate translation
models (TMs) were trained for each of the five
data sets and fed to the decoder. Four additional
indicator features are introduced to distinguish the
different TMs. Further, we applied the hierar-
chical reordering model, the word class language
model, the discriminative word lexicon, and the
insertion and deletion model. Table 2 shows the
results of our experiments.
As a development set for MERT, we use new-
stest2010 in all setups.
3.2 Experimental Results French?English
For the French?English task, a translation model
(TM) was trained on all available parallel data.
For the baseline, we interpolated this TM with
3The parallel 109 corpus is often also referred to as WMT

an in-domain TM trained on EPPS+NC and em-
ployed the hierarchical reordering model. More-
over, three language models were used: The first
language model was trained on the English side
of all available parallel data, the second one on
EPPS and NC and the third LM on the News Shuf-
fled data. The baseline was improved by adding a
fourth LM trained on the Gigaword corpus (Ver-
sion 5) and a 5-gram word class language model
trained on News Shuffled data. For the WCLM,
we used 50 word classes clustered with the tool
mkcls (Och, 2000). All results are presented in Ta-
ble 3.
4 German?English Setups
For both translation directions of the German-
English language pair, we trained phrase-based
translation systems. Corpus statistics for German-
English can be found in Table 4. The language
models are 4-grams trained on the respective tar-
get side of the bilingual data as well as on the
provided News Crawl corpus. For the English
language model the 109 French-English, UN and
LDC Gigaword Fifth Edition corpora are used ad-
ditionally.
4.1 Morpho-syntactic Analysis
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for
the German?English translation, the German text
is preprocessed by splitting German compound
words with the frequency-based method described
in (Koehn and Knight, 2003). To further reduce
translation complexity, we employ the long-range
part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by
Popovic? and Ney (2006).
4.2 Domain Adaptation
This year, we experimented with filtering and
weighting for domain-adaptation for the German-
English task. To perform adaptation, we define a
general-domain (GD) corpus composed from the
news-commentary, europarl and Common Crawl
corpora, and an in-domain (ID) corpus using
a concatenation of the test sets (newstest{2008,
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012}) with the correspond-
ing references. We use the test sets as in-domain

(newswire) as the other corpora are coming from
differing domains (news commentary, parliamen-
tary discussions and various web sources), and on
initial experiments, the other corpora did not per-
form well when used as an in-domain representa-
tive for adaptation. To check whether over-fitting
occurs, we measure the results of the adapted
systems on the evaluation set of this year (new-
stest2013) which was not used as part of the in-
domain set.
The filtering experiments are done similarly to
(Mansour et al, 2011), where we compare filtering
using LM and a combined LM and IBM Model 1
(LM+M1) based scores. The scores for each sen-
tence pair in the general-domain corpus are based
on the bilingual cross-entropy difference of the
in-domain and general-domain models. Denoting
HLM (x) as the cross entropy of sentence x ac-
cording to LM , then the cross entropy difference
DHLM (x) can be written as:
DHLM (x) = HLMID(x)?HLMGD(x)
The bilingual cross entropy difference for a sen-
tence pair (s, t) in the GD corpus is then defined
by:
DHLM (s) + DHLM (t)
For IBM Model 1 (M1), the cross-entropy
HM1(s|t) is defined similarly to the LM cross-
entropy, and the resulting bilingual cross-entropy
difference will be of the form:
DHM1(s|t) + DHM1(t|s)
The combined LM+M1 score is obtained by
summing the LM and M1 bilingual cross-entropy
difference scores. To perform filtering, the GD
corpus sentence pairs are scored by the appropri-
ate method, sorted by the score, and the n-best sen-
tences are then used to build an adapted system.
In addition to adaptation using filtering, we ex-
periment with weighted phrase extraction similar
to (Mansour and Ney, 2012). We differ from their
work by using a combined LM+M1 weight to per-
form the phrase extraction instead of an LM based
weight. We use a combined LM+M1 weight as
this worked best in the filtering experiments, mak-
ing scoring with LM+M1 more reliable than LM
scores only.
4.3 Experimental Results German?English
For the German?English task, the baseline is
trained on all available parallel data and includes
the hierarchical reordering model. The results of
the various filtering and weighting experiments are
summarized in Table 5.

Running Words 104M 104M
Vocabulary 717K 750K
For filtering, we use the 800K best sentences
from the whole training corpora, as this se-
lection performed best on the dev set among
100K,200K,400K,800K,1600K setups. Filtering
seems to mainly improve on the TER scores, BLEU
scores are virtually unchanged in comparison to
the baseline. LM+M1 filtering improves further
on TER in comparison to LM-based filtering.
The weighted phrase extraction performs best
in our experiments, where the weights from the
LM+M1 scoring method are used. Improvements
in both BLEU and TER are achieved, with BLEU
improvements ranging from +0.4% up-to +0.6%
and TER improvements from -0.9% and up-to -
1.1%.
As a final step, we added the English Gigaword
corpus to the LM (+GW). This resulted in further
improvements of the systems.
In addition, the system as described above was
tuned on newstest2009. Using this development
set results in worse translation quality.
Furthermore, we rescored the SCSS baseline
tuned on newstest2009 with a continuous space
language model (CSLM) as described in (Schwenk
et al, 2012). The CSLM was trained on the eu-
roparl and news-commentary corpora. For rescor-
ing, we used the newstest2011 set as tuning set and
re-optimized the parameters with MERT on 1000-
best lists. This results in an improvement of up to
0.8 points in BLEU compared to the baseline.
We compared the phrase-based setups with a
hierarchical translation system, which was aug-
mented with preference grammars, soft string-
to-dependency features, discriminative reordering
extensions, DWL, IDM, and discriminative re-
197
ordering extensions. The phrase table of the hier-
archical setup has been extracted from News Com-
mentary and Europarl parallel data only (not from
Common Crawl).
Finally, three setups were joined in a system
combination and we gained an improvement of up
to 0.5 points in BLEU compared to the best single
system.
4.4 Experimental Results English?German
The results for the English?German task are
shown in Table 6. While the LM-based filter-
ing led to almost no improvement over the base-
line, the LM+M1 filtering brought some improve-
ments in BLEU. In addition to the sentence fil-
tering, we tried to combine the translation model
trained on NC+EPPS with a TM trained on Com-
mon Crawl using the ifelse combination (Mansour
and Ney, 2012). This combination scheme con-
catenates both TMs and assigns the probabilities
of the in-domain TM if it contains the phrase,
else it uses the probabilities of the out-of-domain
TM. Appling this method, we achieved further im-
provements.
5 Conclusion
For the participation in the WMT 2013 shared
translation task, RWTH experimented with both
phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems.
Several different techniques were evaluated and
yielded considerable improvements over the re-
spective baseline systems as well as over our last
year?s setups (Huck et al, 2012b). Among these
techniques are a hierarchical phrase reordering
model, translation model interpolation, domain
adaptation techniques, weighted phrase extraction,
a word class language model, a continuous space
language model and system combination.
