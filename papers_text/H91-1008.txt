I .  INTRODUCTION human peripheral 
Following precedents established as early as the March 
1987 DARPA Speech Recognition Workshop, previously- 
unreleased Benchmark Test Material was selected and released to 
DARPA contractors and others prior to the February 1991 
meeting. Results were reported to NIST and scored using 
"official" scoring software and reference answers and the results 
were reported to the participants. 
All papers in this poster session at the DARPA speech 
workshop reported results obtained using the Benchmark Test 
Material. The Workshop Planning Committee suggested a
three-part session format consisting of: (1) Introductory 
remarks, (2) one hour to review and discuss posters, and (3) 
open discussion. 
Section H of this paper presents an overview describing the 
approaches used by the participants in this session, while 
Section III summarizes the open discussion. Section IV 
describes the benchmark test material selection process and 
benchmark test protocols. Section V presents tabulations of 
these results, and discussion of these results is included in 
Section VI. 
II. SESS ION OVERVIEW 
A total of fourteen papers were presented in poster form. 
Eleven of the papers were presented by DARPA SLS 
contractors, and three were from non-DARPA sites. 
Five papers dealt with speech recognition systems: 
(1) The group at Dragon Systems reported speaker-dependent 
system results for the Resource Management (RM) test set, 
using the word-pair grammar \[1\]. Dragon's results were 
obtained on a 25 Mhz 80486-based PC, with an RM 
vocabulary modelled using "roughly 30,000 phonemes in 
context or PICs", and making use of the Dragon rapid 
match module. 
(2) Doug Paul of MIT Lincoln Laboratory reported speech 
recognition results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC test 
material \[2\]. Recent work includes: variations in 
semiphone modelling, a "very simple improved uration 
model" responsible for reducing the error rate by about 
10%, a new training strategy, and modifications to the 
recognizer to use back-off bigrarn language models. 
(3) The Spoken Language Group at MIT's Laboratory for 
Computer Science also reported results for both the RM 
and ATIS SPREC test material \[3\]. The MIT SUMMIT 
system is a "segment-based" speech recognition system, 
including a front end that incorporates a model of the 
auditory system, a hierarchical 
segmentation algorithm to identify a network of possible 
acoustical segments, segmental measurements, and a 
statistical classifier to produce a phonetic network. The 
best-scoring word sequence is derived by matching the 
phonetic network against a pronunciation etwork. 
Recent developments have incorporated more complex 
context-dependency modelling as well as an improved 
corrective training procedure. 
(4) Francis Kubala et al reported on BBN's BYBLOS results 
for both the RM and ATIS SPREC test material \[4\]. The 
reported RM speaker-independent r sults include results for 
a SI model built using only 12 training speakers. BBN's 
ATIS results include speaker-independent r sults for two 
conditions. "The first is a controlled condition using a 
specific training set and bigram grammar" \[similar to that 
used by Paul \[2\]\]. The second condition makes use of 
augmented training data (collected at BBN) and a 4-grarn 
class grammar. 
(5) A collaborative effort involving Marl Ostendorf and her 
colleagues at Boston University and others at BBN makes 
use of a general formalism for integrating two or more 
speech recognition technologies \[5\]. "In this formalism, 
one system uses the N-best search strategy to generate a
list of candidate sentences; the list is restored by other 
systems; and the different scores are combined to optimize 
perforrnanee." Ostendorf et al "report on combining the 
BU system based on stochastic segment models and the 
BBN system based on hidden Markov models." 
Six papers were presented by DARPA contractors describing 
integrations of speech and natural anguage processing into 
ATIS systems. 
(1) The Spoken Language Group at MIT's Laboratory for 
Computer Science presented a status report on the MIT 
ATIS system \[6\]. A context-independent version of the 
SUMMIT system (described in \[3\]) including a word-pair 
grammar with perplexity 92 has been incorporated. The 
back-end has been redesigned, and the parser now produces 
an intermediate semantic-frame r presentation "which 
serves as the focal-point for all back- end operations." 
Results are reported for both the February '91 ATIS 
benchmark test set and for a test set collected at MIT. 
(2) The Speech and Natural Language Groups at SRI reported 
results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC speech 
recognition test sets and for the ATIS NL and SLS tests \[7\]. 
The primary emphasis of the SRI presentation was to 
describe improvements o the SRI DECIPHER speech 
recognition system, a component in SRI's ATIS system. 
49  
Recent "significant" performance improvements are 
attributed to the addition of tied-mixture HMM modelling. 
Other approaches discussed include experiments with male- 
female separation, speaker adaptation, rejection of out-of- 
vocabulary input, and language modelling (including the 
use of multi-word lexical units). SRI's "simple serial 
integration of speech and natural anguage processing" is 
said to work well "because the speech recognition system 
uses a statistical language model to improve recognition 
performance, and because the natural anguage processing 
uses a template matching approach (described elsewhere in 
this proceedings) that makes it somewhat insensitive to 
recognition errors". 
(3) Wayne Ward presented one of two papers from CMU 
describing the CMU ATIS System, "PHOENIX" \[8\]. The 
speech recognition component consists of a recent 
vocabulary-independent version of SPHINX, presently 
without incorporation of out-of- vocabulary models. 
PHOENIX's "concept of flexible parsing combines frame- 
based semantics with a semantic phrase grammar," so that 
the "operation of the parser can be viewed as 'phrase 
spotting.'" Language modelling included a bigram model 
for the recognizer and a grammar for the parser. 
(4) The second paper from CMU, by Sheryl Young, described 
the "structure and operation of SOUL (for Semantically- 
Oriented Understanding of Language)" \[9\]. SOUL can use 
semantic and pragmatic knowledge to correct, reject and/or 
clarify the outputs of the PHOENIX case frame parser in the 
ATIS domain. 
(5) BBN's NL group reported on the BBN DELPHI natural 
language system and the integration of this system with 
the BBN BYBLOS system (described in \[4\]), using an N- 
best architecture \[10\]. The BBN authors cite a number of 
improvements o the DELPHI system that are described in 
other papers in this Proceedings. 
(6) Recent work on the Unisys ATIS Spoken Language System 
was described by Norton et al \[11\]. "Enhancements to the 
system's semantic processing for handling non- 
transparent argument structure and enhancements o the 
system's pragmatic processing of material in answers 
displayed to the user" are described. In addition to the 
Unisys system's NL results, results were reported for the 
case of SLS systems consisting of the Unisys natural 
language system coupled with two ATIS speech 
recognition systems: (1) the MIT SUMMIT system 
(described in \[3\]) and (2) the MIT Lincoln Labs system 
(described in \[2\]). The Unisys system's natural anguage 
constraints were also used to select he first-best of N-best 
speech recognition results (for the SPREC tests) based on 
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge. 
Three papers were presented by non-DARPA sites. 
(1) Douglas O'Shaughnessy described "the initial development 
of a natural anguage text processor, as the first step in an 
INRS \[INRS-Telecommunications, University of Quebec\] 
dialogue- by-voice system \[12\]. A keyword slot-filling 
approach is used, rather than a "standard parser for 
English." 
(2) In one of two papers from AT&T Bell Laboratories included 
in this session, Evelyne Tzoukermarm described "The Use 
of a Commercial Natural Language Interface in the ATIS 
Task" \[13\]. Tzoukermarm relates their "experience in 
adapting \[a commercial natural language interface\] to 
handle domain dependent ATIS queries." The discussion of 
error analysis notes that, in contrast o the "well-formed" 
written English for which the commercial product was 
designed, spontaneous peech contains repetitions, 
restarts, deletions, interjections and ellipsis, as well as the 
omission of punctuation marks that "might give the 
system information". 
(3) The second AT&T Bell Laboratories paper, by Pieraccini, 
Levin and Lee, proposes "a model for a statistical 
representation f the conceptual structure in a restricted 
subset of spoken natural language" \[14\]. The "technique of 
ease decoding" is applied to the Class A sentences in the 
ATIS domain, with sentences analyzed in terms of 7 
general cases: QUERY, OBJECT, ATTRIBUTE, 
RESTRICTION, Q\[UERY\] ATTRIBUTE, AND, and 
DUMMY. Unlike other papers in this session, this paper 
implements a non-standard test paradigm that prevents 
explicit comparisons with the results cited for other 
systems. To address this shortcoming, the authors indicate 
that they "are developing a module that translates the 
conceptual representation into an SQL query". Presumably 
the SQL queries, in conjunction with the ATIS relational 
database, will permit use of existing DARPA ATIS query- 
answer performance evaluation procedures. 
H I .  D ISCUSSION 
Following review of the posters, a number of issues were 
discussed. 
(1) Differences between ATIS Test Sets: 
It was noted that there were a number of differences between the 
June 1990 and February 1991 ATIS test sets, including evidence 
of greater-than-expected incidence of dysfluencies in the speech 
and "skewed" or disproportionate r presentation of some 
syntactic/semantic phenomena. Doug Paul noted that the test 
set perplexity for the June 1990 "Class A" test set was 18, in 
contrast with 22 for the present "Class A" test set, and a 
perplexity of 45 for the "non-Class A" test material (i.e., all 
other utterances). Inferences about "progress" or "trends" may 
thus be complicated by these differences between test sets. 
(2) Limited training material: 
Also noted was the fact that only a limited amount of fully 
"canonized" training material--for training acoustic models 
and for studying such phenomena s dialogue modelling--was 
available prior to this meeting, in some cases limiting system 
development. This factor was cited in a number of papers e.g., 
\[2, 4, 8, 10\]). 
(3) Limitations on the future value of the Resource 
Management Corpora: 
Hy Murveit noted his belief that demonstrable progress in 
recognizing speaker independent RM1 speech was limited by 
"how much information we can tease out of \[3990\] training 
50  
utterances". Richard Schwartz took exception to this, citing IV. BENCHMARK TEST MATERIAL  AND 
steady progress in recognizing RM speech. PROTOCOLS 
(4) Properties of ATIS-domain speech: 
Richard Schwartz shared some analysis of the ATIS-domain test 
set speakers. He noted that there was one speaker in the test set 
with "24 instances of 'uh' in 12 sentences", \[which leads to\] "a 
50% word error rate" for that speaker. On the basis of his 
analysis, he noted that "people don't know how to talk to a 
system", and suggested that there ought o be more user/speaker 
feedback during the data collection process so that the 
incidence of dysfluencies would be reduced. In response, Hy 
Murveit noted that if we regard the two worst speakers in the 
test material as atypical, then "the current word error rate is 
close to 15%, and with some success in modelling the 'urns' and 
'ers', the error rate may be only 10%, or abeut wice as bad as 
for RM". Correlation was noted between difficulty in 
recognizing both the speech and \[in understanding\] thenatural 
language for the "bad" speakers, so that the suggestion that 
these speakers may be atypical may be warranted. 
Patti Price noted that the \[speech recognition\] error rates 
suggest that "ATIS is more difficult, but we don't know why". It 
may be that ATIS speech is "more casual", but we need to study 
these issues in more detail, especially as they affect data 
collection. 
(5) Selection of the February ATIS test material: 
Victor Zue and Rich Schwartz asked about selection of the 
February 1991 ATIS test set, asking if there had been screening 
to select or reject potential test material on the basis of the 
incidence of dysfluencies noted in the transcriptions. NIST 
noted that the only such screening was to partition some of the 
utterances into the "Optional" categories on the basis of 
evidence of verbal deletions in the "lexical SNOR" 
transcriptions, ince this evidence does not appear in the 
conventional SNOR transcriptions. For the June test set, there 
was no such screening, since attention had not been directed to 
the subset containing verbal deletions. 
(6) Use of "Baseline" or "Reference" Conditions: 
John Makhoul noted that there "too many uncontrolled 
variables" (e.g., algorithms, training materials, grammar) to 
make comparisons of the ATIS speech recognition systems 
beneficial using the SPREC results. BBN had advocated use of a 
"baseline" condition and provided SPREC data for both a 
"baseline" and an "augmented" training condition to permit 
such comparisons \[4\]. MIT/LL also made use of this "baseline" 
condition \[2\]. Makhoul noted that a similar situation (i.e., 
"too many uncontrolled variables") applies for the case of the 
NL results. Hy Murveit noted that SRI's reluctance to"lock into 
a baseline condition" was based on a reluctance to choose one 
with the 'wrong operating point'", based on inadequate 
training. Francis Kubala noted, however, that choosing a 
"baseline that undershoots" \[performance\] ought not to be a 
problem if one wished to "demonstrate clear wins", and that 
such a baseline could be changed over time. John Makhoul also 
noted that reporting error rates is in general preferable to 
reporting "scores". 
Benchmark Test Material 
One portion of the test material consisted of beth "Speaker- 
Dependent" and "Speaker-Independent" test sets from the 
Resource Management (RM1) Corpus, for use in tests of speech 
recognition technology. Each of these test sets consisted of 
300 sentence utterances. The most recent ests using the RM1 
corpus were conducted prior to the October 1989 Meeting, 
sixteen months ago. A second portion of the test material 
consisted of Air Travel Information System (ATIS) domain 
speech material and related transcriptions. This material was 
collected at TI in recent months, using the "Wizard" protocol 
described by Hemphill at the June Meeting \[15\]. There were a 
total of 9 speakers in the ATIS test set. 
This material was partitioned into four subsets: one subset 
consisting of an extension of the "Class A" category used at the 
June meeting (expanded to include "testably ambiguous" 
queries) and containing 145 queries, a second subset consisting 
of 38 Class D1 query pairs, and two additional smaller 
"optional" subsets that included examples of "verbal deletion" 
and/or "verbal correction" (i.e., Optional Class A and Optional 
Class D1). The transcriptions u ed as input to the NL systems 
and for scoring the ATIS SPREC tests were provided using a 
recently developed "lexical SNOR" format. 
CMU reported benchmark Resource Management results that 
were not represented in the poster session. These data from 
CMU are included in the tables of reported results. A paper 
describing how these results were achieved appears in \[17\]. 
Benchmark  Test  P ro toco ls  
In addition to the Resource Management speech recognition 
tests, for which there is considerable precedent, the ATIS 
material could be used for three tests: (1) spontaneous ATIS- 
domain SPeech RECognition component tests (designated as 
SPREC in this paper), (2) ATIS-domain Natural Language 
system component tests (designated as NL), and (3) complete 
ATIS-domain Spoken Language System tests (designated as 
SLS). During the June meeting, several sites reported results 
for NL tests, with CMU being the sole site to report complete 
SLS test results at that meeting \[16\]. 
The SPREC test design was outlined by an ad hoc Working 
Group chaired by Victor Zue, with scoring software adapted for 
this purpose by NIST. This is the first time that the SPREC test 
has been implemented. 
In computing results tabulated for the NL and SLS tests, the 
most reeeent version of the NIST "comparator" was used to 
compare the hypothesized CAS-format answers against NIST's 
"canonical" reference answers, as described in a previous paper 
\[16\]. Answers are scored as either "True", "False", or (if the 
No_Answer option has been exercised) "No Answer". 
A DARPA SLS Coordinating Committee decision in 
November, 1990 suggested computation of a "weighted error 
percentage" on the basis that (on "intuitive grounds") "a false 
answer is twice as bad as no answer". The weighted error so 
defmed consists of two times the percentage of total queries in 
the subset hat are scored "False" plus the percentage scored 
53. 
"No Answer". A single-number "score" may be derived by 
subtracting the weighted error from 100%, providing a single- 
number score that may range from -100%, for the case of all 
false answers, to +100% for all true answers. 
A "Class D1 test protocol" was developed and used on a trial 
basis for these tests. Class D1 consists of query pairs for which 
the second query ("Q2") has been classified as "context 
dependent", and for which an answerable prior query ("QI") has 
been identified as defining the context for Q2. Scoring of Class 
D1 query pairs was for the answers provided only for Q2, 
regardless of the answers provided for the context-setting 
query, Q1. 
The Class D1 test protocol had never previously been 
implemented, and its usage was regarded by many participants 
more as a "debugging of a test protocol" than as a valid 
indicator of systems' abilities to handle context-dependent 
queries. It is also the case that the amount of labelled "Class 
Di" training material was extremely small and that it was not 
widely available until shortly before the test --thus limiting 
system developers' abilities to make adequate use of the 
training material. Future implementations of the Class D1 test 
protocol will undoubtedly yield more significant results. 
The "optional" test subsets are not discussed extensively in 
Section VI since these subsets axe too small, and their usage too 
limited, to have significance. 
V. BENCHMARK TEST  RESULTS 
Tables 1 - 4 (included at the end of the text of this paper) 
present abulations of results reported to NIST for uniform 
scoring against the final "official" sets of reference 
transcriptions and reference answers. 
Some of these numbers may differ slightly from those 
reported at the meeting or in some of the papers in this 
proceedings, since earlier results reported at the Asilomar 
meeting were derived with: (1) a slightly larger Class A test set 
(148 vs. 145 queries), since the classification of 3 utterances, 
originally included in the Class A subset, was reconsidered, 
after the meeting, and determined tobe "unanswerable" and thus 
not Class A, and (2) the reference answers for several utterances 
were corrected andlor modified in response to comments from 
the participants in these tests. However, these differences are 
not likely to be statistically significant. 
Designation of a set of results as "LATE" signifies that the 
results were received at NIST some time after midnight on 
February 6th, 1991. "COB" on that date had been designated as 
the due date for submission of results. In some cases prior 
notice had been given to NIST that results would arrive "late", 
and in a few cases, late results were invited for the sake of 
completeness and to permit informative comparisons with 
earlier esults.

In Tables 3 and 4, both the number of queries (and the 
corresponding percentage of the total number of queries in a 
given category) are shown for the categories "True" (or correct), 
"False" (incorrect) and "No Answer". The "Weighted Error" 
percentage was computed by multiplying the percentage of 
False answers by 2 and adding the percentage of "No_Answer" 
responses. The column labelled "Score" was computed by 
subtracting the Weighted Error (%) from 100%.

V I .  D ISCUSSION OF  BENCHMARK TEST  
RESULTS 
RM1 Speech  Recogn i t ion  Resu l ts  (Table 1) 
Focusing on the Speaker Independent test set results, with 
use of the Word Pair grammar, the word error ranges from 9.7% 
to 3.6%, while the sentence error ranges from 47.3% to 19.3%. 
Using the NIST implementation f the McNemar test used in 
previous tests \[16\], the differences between the sentence rror- 
level results for the system with the lowest reported word and 
sentence rror rates (sys4, the CMU system described in 
reference \[18\]) and all other systems in this category are 
significant for all but sysl0 and sysl l  (two BBN systems 
described in reference \[4\]). The sentence- error-level- 
performance differences between the CMU system and the two 
BBN systems are not significant. 
There are three sets of results for the BU-BBN collaborative 
effort described in \[5\]. The first of these (designated sys7), 
with a santenee error rate of 27.0%, results from the hybrid BU- 
BBN system. The second of these (sysl2), with a sentence 
error rate of 27.7%, results from the top answer from the BBN 
N-best system used for this study. The third (sysl3), with a 
sentence error rate of 47.3%, results from the top answer of the 
BU context-independent, gender-dependent segment model 
system. 
Lowest overall word and sentence rror rates (1.8% and 
12.0%, respectively) are reported for the case of the speaker- 
dependent Word-Pair grammar system results (sys5) reported by 
Paul, at MIT/LL, described in \[2\]. 
In addition to results reported in this session, note that 
results were reported to NIST for two systems not described in 
this session. Huang et al at CMU reported results for an HMM 
system incorporating a "shared semi-continuons model". That 
52  
system is described in a paper to be presented at ICASSP-91 
\[17\]. Gauvain and Lee at AT&T Bell Laboratories reported 
results for an investigation "into the use of Bayesian learning 
of the parameters of a Gaussian mixture density", and this study 
is reported in another paper in this proceedings \[18\]. 
AT IS  SPREC Resu l ts  (Tab le  2) 
Focusing on the word error for the 145 utterances in the 
Class A test set, the range is from 46.1% to 15.7%, while the 
sentence error ranges from 91.0% to 52.4%. 
The McNemar sentence-error-level significance test (not 
shown) indicates that the system with the lowest reported word 
and sentence rror rate for the Class A utterances ( ys24-a, the 
Unisys implementation f syntactic, semantic and pragmatic 
constraints in selecting the first candidate from an N-best 
listing provided by BBN, described in \[11\]) has an error rate 
that is significantly less than all but two other systems, 
(sysl8-a, the BBN "augmented training" system, and sys06-a, 
the SRI system). Performance differences (at the sentence error 
level) between these three systems, however, are not 
significant. 
Comparison of the results for the BBN "baseline" and 
"augmented" training condition (sysl8 and sysl9) gives some 
indication of the benefits of additional (in this case, domain- 
specific) training and a more powerful 4-gram statistical class 
grammar. The McNemar test indicates that the difference in 
performance between sysl8-a and 19-a is significant. 
Comparisons of results for similar systems for the two 
larger test subsets (i.e., Class A results vs. Class D1 results) 
suggest that the Class D1 material is somewhat more difficult o 
recognize (i.e., the error rates are higher). An interesting 
hypothesis that may account, in part, for this phenomenon is 
offered by Norton et al: "...this higher error rate in context 
dependent spontaneous tterances may be due in part to the 
presence of prosodic phenomena common in dialogue such as 
destressing 'old' information" \[11\]. 
Typical SPREC error rates are higher still for the two 
"optional" test subsets. This ought not to be surprising in view 
of the fact that these utterance subsets are, by definition and 
selection, more dysfluent (i.e., contain verbal deletions). 
Not shown in Table 2, but indicated by other analyses, is 
high inter-subject variability for the SPREC tests as well as for 
the NL and SiS tests. 
AT IS  NL  Resu l ts  (Tab le  3) 
For the Class A subset, results are tabulated for eight NL 
systems at 5 DARPA contractors' ites, and at AT&T Bell 
Laboratories and at INRS-Telecom. For the DARPA contractor's 
systems, the weighted error ranges from 51.7% to 31.0%. 
The two sets of CMU results include data for the PHOENIX 
system described in \[8\] (sysOl), and for the PHOENIX system 
integrated with the SOUL module described by Young in \[9\] 
(sys02). 
For the Class A test material, the lowest weighted error 
figures (31.0%) are found for both the SRI system described by 
Murveit et al in \[7\] (sys13-a), and for the CMU PHOENIX + 
SOUL system of \[9\] (sys02-a). 
For the Class D1 and Optional Class D1 subsets, the 
weighted error percentages are substantially higher than for the 
Class A results. For the Class D1 test material, the lowest 
weighted error figures (36.8%) are found for the Unisys system 
described by Norton et al in \[11\] (sys09-d). 
Note that two sets of results are reported for the Class D1 
material for BBN (denoted syslS-d and sys23-d). Subsequent to 
submission of the initial results for sysl5-d, BBN's 
representatives notified NIST that "...there was a small bug in 
the component that translates the result of the understanding 
(i.e., the output of the discourse component) into SQL... \[and 
that since\] the bug in our system.., was NOT in the 
UNDERSTANDING or the DISCOURSE component but between 
the output of those components and the SQL backend and ... 
\[since\] one small quick fix in the backend corrected the 
problem, we concluded that it is reasonable to send you new 
answers for our Class D test" \[19\]. The data designated as 
sys23-d is derived from these "new answers". 
AT IS  SLS  Resu l ts  (Tab le  4) 
For the Class A subset, results are tabulated for 7 SLS 
systems at 5 DARPA contractors' sites. Non-DARPA 
contractors declined to participate in the SLS tests. The 
weighted error ranges considerably, from 90.3% to 41.4%, with 
the best (lowest weighted error) results for the SRI system 
described in \[7\] and in other SRI papers in this proceedings. 
The low SRI SLS weighted error rate (41.4%) appears to be a 
consequence of both a well-performing ATIS speech 
recognition component and a well-performing natural language 
component (i.e., a SPREC test word error rate of 18.0% and an 
NL weighted error rate of 31.0%). 
Not surprisingly, weighted error figures for complete SLS 
systems are higher than for corresponding NL components 
(processing the lexical SNOR formatted versions of the same 
utterances). The relative increase in weighted error rate appears 
to correspond to the relative performance of the speech 
recognition component. 
By comparing comparable data from Tables 3 and 4, note 
that for the SRI system the weighted error rate for the Class A 
subset increases from 31.0% (for the NL component) o41.4% 
(for the complete SLS system. 
Two SLS systems made use of BBN's BYBLOS ATIS SPREC 
data: the BBN HARC system (sys16-a) and the Unisys-BBN 
SPREC system (sys22-a). Comparing the increases of weighted 
error rates for NL vs. SLS systems, one can note an 
approximate increase in weighted error rate of only 8 or 9 
percentage points for these systems (i.e., from 49.0% for the 
BBN DELPHI NL system to 57.2% for the BBN HARC SIS 
system, and from 51.7% for the Unisys NL system to 60.7% for 
the Unisys-((BBN SPREC)) SLS system). This relatively small 
increase in error rate is probably attributable to the BBN 
"augmented training" (sysl8-a) SPREC test word error rate of 
(only) 16.1%, which is not significantly different from SRI's 
SPREC test results of 18.0%. 
53  
In contrast, a substantially larger increase in error rate can 
be noted for the CMU systems (i.e., 35.9% and 31.0% for the 
two CMU NL systems vs. 65.5% for the SLS system), probably 
due to performance of the CMU SPREC system with error rates 
that are significantly higher than for the SRI SPREC system. 
Unisys reported results for three system configurations: 
using speech recognition results provided by the MIT/LCS 
ATIS SPREC system (designated sysl0-a), by the MIT/LL ATIS 
SPREC system (sys ll-a), and by the BBN BYBLOS/ATIS 
system (sys22-a). In this case, better performance on the SLS 
test (i.e., lower weighted error) correlates with better 
performance on the SPREC results, as would be expected. 
As was also the case for the NL results, the weighted error 
results for the Class D1 test subset are substantially higher than 
for the Class A results. 
V I I .  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Too many individuals have served as points-of-contact a  
the research sites involved in these benchmark tests to be 
individually thanked, but their efforts and patience in seeing 
that information and data are made available are greatly 
appreciated. My colleagues at NIST deserve special thanks for 
their efforts and effieiancy in making these tests possible and 
in tabulation of the results. In particular, Bill Fisher has had a 
key role, both as Chairman of the DARPA SLS Performance 
Evaluation Working Group and as the individual responsible for 
ATIS test material selection and in reviewing the "canonical" 
auxiliary files. Jon Fiscus and John Garofolo, also at NIST, 
have been responsible for implementation f scoring software 
and for preparation of corpora on CD-ROM.
