Abstract 
This paper presents an approach to trans-
lating Chinese organization names into 
English based on correlative expansion. 
Firstly, some candidate translations are 
generated by using statistical translation 
method. And several correlative named 
entities for the input are retrieved from a 
correlative named entity list. Secondly, 
three kinds of expansion methods are 
used to generate some expanded queries. 
Finally, these queries are submitted to a 
search engine, and the refined translation 
results are mined and re-ranked by using 
the returned web pages. Experimental re-
sults show that this approach outperforms 
the compared system in overall transla-
tion accuracy.  
1 Introduction 
There are three main types of named entity: loca-
tion name, person name, and organization name. 
Organization name translation is a subtask of 
named entity translation. It is crucial for many 
NLP tasks, such as cross-language information 
retrieval, machine translation, question and an-
swering system. For organization name transla-
tion, there are two problems among it which are 
very difficult to handle.  
Problem I: There is no uniform rule that can 
be abided by to select proper translation methods 
for the inside words of an organization name. For 
example, a Chinese word ????, when it is used 
as a modifier for a university, it is translated to 
Northeastern for ?????/Northeastern Uni-
versity?, and is translated to Northeast for ???
????/Northeast Forestry University?, and is 
mapped to Chinese Pinyin Dongbei for ????
???/Dongbei University of Finance and Eco-
nomics?. It is difficult to decide which transla-
tion method should be chosen when we translate 
the inside words of an organization name.  
Problem II: There is no uniform rule that can 
be abided by to select proper translation order 
and proper treatment of particles Here particles 
refer to prepositions and articles) for an input 
organization name. For example, the organiza-
tion name ???????/China Construction 
Bank? and the organization name ??????
?/Agricultural Bank of China?, they are very 
similar both in surface forms and in syntax struc-
tures, but their translation orders are different, 
and their treatments of particles are also different. 
Generally, there are two strategies usually 
used for named entity translation in previous re-
search. One is alignment based approach, and the 
other is generation based approach. Alignment 
based approach (Chen et al 2003; Huang et al 
2003; Hassan and Sorensen, 2005; and so on) 
extracts named entities translation pairs from 
parallel or comparable corpus by some alignment 
technologies, and this approach is not suitable to 
solve the above two problems. Because new or-
ganization names are constantly being created, 
and alignment based method usually fails to 
cover these new organization names that don?t 
occur in the bilingual corpus.  
Traditional generation based approach (Al-
Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Jiang et al.2007; 
Yang et al 2008; and so on) usually consists of 
two parts. Firstly, it will generate some candidate 
translations for the input; then it will re-rank 
these candidate translations to assign the correct 
translations high ranks. Cheng and Zong [2008] 
proposed another generation based approach for 
organization name translation, which directly 
translates organization names according to their 
inherent structures. But their approach still can?t 
solve the above two problems. This is because 
the amount of organization names is so huge and 
many of them have their own special translation 
rules to handle the above two problems. And the 
inherent structures don?t reveal these translation 
rules. Traditional generation based approach is 
suitable for organization name translation. But in 
previous research, the final translation perform-
ance depends on the candidate translation gen-
143
eration process greatly. If this generation process 
failed, it is impossible to obtain correct result 
from the re-ranking process. In response to this, 
Huang et al [2005] proposed a novel method that 
mined key phrase translation form web by using 
topic-relevant hint words. But in their approach, 
they removed the candidate translation genera-
tion process, which will improve extra difficult 
during mining phrase. Besides, in their approach, 
the features considered to obtain topic-relevant 
words are not so comprehensive, which will af-
fect the quality of returned web pages where the 
correct translations are expected to be included. 
There is still much room for the improvement 
process of the topic-relevant words extraction.  
Inspired by the traditional generation based 
named entity translation strategy and the ap-
proach proposed by Huang et al, we propose an 
organization name translation approach that min-
ing the correct translations of input organization 
name from the web. Our aim is to solve the 
above two problems indirectly by retrieving the 
web pages that contain the correct translation of 
the input and mining the correct translation from 
them. Given an input organization name, firstly, 
some candidate translations are generated by us-
ing statistical translation method. And several 
correlative named entities for the input are re-
trieved from a correlative named entity list. Sec-
ondly, expanded queries are generated by using 
three kinds of query expansion methods. Thirdly, 
these queries are submitted to a search engine, 
and the final translation results are mined and re-
ranked by using the returned web pages.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows, 
section 2 presents the extraction process of cor-
relative named entities, section 3 presents a detail 
description of our translation method for Chinese 
organization name, and section 4 introduces our 
parameter evaluation method, and section 5 is the 
experiments and discussions part, finally conclu-
sions and future work are given in section 6.  
2 Extraction of Correlative Named En-
tities 
The key of our approach is to find some web 
pages that contain the correct translation of the 
input. With the help of correlative named entities 
(here if two named entities are correlative, it 
means that they are usually used to describe the 
same topic), it is easier to find such web pages. 
This is because that in the web, one web page 
usually has one topic. Thus if two named entities 
are correlative, they are very likely to occur in 
pair in some web pages.  
The correlative named entity list is constructed 
in advance. During translation, the correlative 
named entities for the input organization name 
are retrieved from this list directly. To set up this 
correlative named entity list, an about 180GB-
sized collection of web pages are used. Totally 
there are about 100M web pages in this collec-
tion. Named entities are recognized from every 
web page by using a NER tool. This NER tool is 
trained by CRF model 1  with the corpus from 
SIGHAN-20082.  
2.1 Features Used 
During the extraction of correlative named enti-
ties, the following features are considered.  
Co-occurrence in a Document The more of-
ten two named entities co-occur in a document, 
the more likely they are correlative. This feature 
is denoted as 1 2( , )iCoD n n , which means the co-
occurrence of named entities 1n and 2n  in a docu-
ment iD . This feature is also the main feature 
used in Huang et al [2005].   
Co-occurrence in Documents The more often 
two named entities co-occur in different docu-
ments, the more likely they are correlative. This 
feature is denoted as 1 2( , )CoDs n n , which means 
the number of documents that both 1n  and 2n oc-
cur in. 
Distance The closer two named entities is in a 
document, the more likely they are correlative. 
This feature is denoted as 1 2( , )iDistD n n , which 
means the number of words between 1n and 2n  
in a document iD . 
Mutual Information Mutual information is a 
metric to measure the correlation degree of two 
words. The higher two named entities? mutual 
information, the more likely they are correlative. 
And the mutual information of named entities 
1n and 2n  in a document iD is computed as fol-
lowing formula.

words. The higher two named entities? Jaccard

where ( )iD n  is the number of documents that

documents that both in  and jn occur in. 
TF-IDF TF-IDF is a weight computation 
method usually used in information retrieval. 
Here for a named entity in , TF-IDF is used to 
measure the importance of its correlative named 
entities. The TF-IDF value of jn in a document 
iD is computed as following formula.

where ijtf is the frequency of jn in docu-
ment iD , N is the number of total documents, 
and ( )jD n is the number of documents that 
jn occurs in.  
2.2 Feature Combination 
During the process of feature combination, every 
feature is normalized, and the final correlative 
degree of two named entities is the linear combi-
nation of these normalized features, and it is 
computed as following formula.

Finally, for every organization name in , its 
top-K correlative named entities are selected to 
construct the correlative named entity list.  
During translation, the correlative words for 
the input can be retrieved from this correlative 
list directly. If the input is not included in this list, 
the same method as in Huang et al [2005] is 
used to obtain the needed correlative words.  
3 Organization Name Translation 
Based on Correlative Expansion 
3.1 Statistical Translation Module 
The first step of our approach is to generate some 
candidate translations for every input organiza-
tion name. As shown in table 1, these candidate 
translations are used as query stems during query 
expansion. We use Moses3, a state of the art pub-
lic machine translation tool, to generate such 
candidate translations. Here Moses is trained 
with the bilingual corpus that is from the 4th 
China Workshop on Machine Translation4. Total 
there are 868,947 bilingual Chinese-English sen-
tence pairs on news domain in this bilingual cor-
pus. Moses receives an organization name as in-
put, and outputs the N-best results as the candi-
date translations of the input organization name. 
Total there are six features used in Moses: phrase 
translation probability, inverse phrase translation 
probability, lexical translation probability, in-
verse lexical translation probability, language 
model, and sentence length penalty. All the 
needed parameters are trained with MERT 
method (Och, 2003) by using a held-out devel-
opment set.  
3.2 Query Expansions 
Because the amount of available web pages is so 
huge, the query submitted to search engine must 
be well designed. Otherwise, the search engine 
will return large amount of un-related web pages. 
This will enlarge the difficulty of mining phase. 
Here three kinds of expansion methods are pro-
posed to generate some queries by combining the 
clues given by statistical translation method and 
the clues given by correlative named entities of 
the input. And these correlative named entities 
are retrieved from the correlative named entities 
list before the query expansions process. These 
three kinds of expansions are explained as fol-
lows. 
3.2.1 Monolingual Expansion  
Given an input organization name in , suppose 
is is one of its candidate translations, and jn is 
one of its correlative named entities. If jn can be 
reliably translated5, we expand is with this reli-
                                                 
3 http://www.statmt.org/moses/  
4 http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cwmt-2008  
5 A word can be reliably translated means either it has 
a unique dictionary translation or it is a Chinese 
145
able translation ( )jt n  to form a query 
? is + ( )jt n ?. This kind of expansion is called as 
monolingual expansion.  
For two named entities, if they are correlative, 
their translations are likely correlative too. So 
their translations are also likely to occur in pair 
in some web pages. Suppose a query generated 
by this expansion is ? is + ( )jt n ?, if the candidate 
translation is is the correct translation of the in-
put, there must be some returned web pages that 
contain is completely. Otherwise, it is still possi-
ble to obtain some returned web pages that con-
tain the correct translation. This is because that 
the search engine will return both the web pages 
that include the query completely and the web 
pages that include the query partly. And for a 
translation candidate is and the correct transla-
tion 'is , they are very likely to have some com-
mon words, so some of their returned web pages 
may overlap each other. Thus it can be expected 
that when we submit ? is + ( )jt n ? to search en-
gine, it will return some web pages that include 
? 'is + ( )jt n ? or include 'is .  This is very helpful 
for the mining phase. 
3.2.2 Bilingual Expansion  
Given an input organization name in , suppose 
is is one of its candidate translations, we ex-
pand is with in  to form a query ? is + in ?. This 
kind of expansion is called as bilingual expan-
sion. 
Bilingual expansion is very useful to verify 
whether a candidate translation is the correct 
translation. To give readers more information or 
they are not sure about the translation of original 
named entity, the Chinese authors usually in-
clude both the original form of a named entity 
and its translation in the mix-language web pages 
[Fei Huang et al 2005]. So the correct translation 
pair is likely to obtain more supports from the 
returned web pages than those incorrect transla-
tion pairs. Thus bilingual expansion is very use-
ful for the re-ranking phase. 
Besides, for an input organization name, if one 
of its incorrect candidate translations is  is very 
                                                                          
person name and can be translated by Pinyin map-
ping.  
similar to the correct translation 'is  in surface 
form, the correct translation is also likely to be 
contained in the returned web pages by using this 
kind of queries. The reason for this is the search 
mechanism of search engine, which has been 
explained above in monolingual expansion. 
3.2.3 Mix-language Expansion  
Given an input organization name in , suppose 
is is one of its candidate translations, and jn is 
one of its correlative named entities. We ex-
pand is with jn  to form a query ? is + jn ?. This 
kind of expansion is called as mix-language ex-
pansion.  
Mix-language expansion is a necessary com-
plement to the other two expansions. Besides, 
this mix-language expansion is more prone to 
obtain some mix-language web pages that may 
contain both the original input organization name 
and its correct translation.  
3.3 Mining 
When the expanded queries are submitted to 
search engine, the correct translation of the input 
organization name may be contained in the re-
turned web pages. Because the translation of an 
organization name must be also an organization 
name, we mine the correct translation of the in-
put among the English organization names. Here 
we use the Stanford named entity recognition 
toolkits6  to recognize all the English organiza-
tion names in the returned web pages. Then align 
these recognized organization names to the input 
by considering the following features. 
Mutual Translation Probability The transla-
tion probability measures the semantic equiva-
lence between a source organization name and its 
target candidate translation. And mutual transla-
tion probability measures this semantic equiva-
lence in two directions. For simplicity, here we 
use IBM model-1(Brown et al 1993), which 
computes two organization names? translation 
probability using the following formula.

Golden Translation Ratio For two organiza-
tion names, their golden translation ratio is de-
fined as the percentage of words in one organiza-
tion name whose reliable transactions can be 
found in another organization name. This feature 
is used to measure the probability of one named 
entity is the translation of the other. It is com-
puted as following formula.

where ( , )i jG n s is the number of golden trans-

number of golden translated words from js to in .  
Co-occurrence In Web Pages For an input 
organization name in and a recognized candidate 
translation js , the more often they co-occur in 
different web pages, the more likely they are 
translations of each other. This feature is denoted 
as ( , )i jCoS n s , which means the number of web 
pages that both 1n  and js occur in. 
Input Matching Ratio This feature is defined 
as the percentage of the words in the input that 
can be found in a returned web page. For those 
mix-language web pages, this feature is used to 
measure the probability of the correct translation 
occurring in a returned web page. It is computed 
as the following formula.

words in a correlative named entity that can be 
found in a returned web page. This feature is also 
used to measure the probability of the correct

where K is the number of returned web pages,

For every input organization name, we remain 
a fixed number of mined candidate translations 
with the highest confidence scores. And add 
them to the original candidate translation set to 
form a revised candidate translation set.  
3.4 Re-ranking 
The aim of mining is to improve recall. And in 
the re-ranking phase, we hope to improve preci-
sion by assigning the correct translation a higher 
rank. The features considered here for the re-
ranking phase are listed as follows.  
Confidence Score The confidence score of 
in and jt  is not only useful for the mining phase, 
but also is useful for the re-ranking phase. The 
higher this score, the higher rank this candidate 
translation should be assigned.  
Inclusion Ratio For Bilingual Query This 
feature is defined as the percentage of the re-
turned web pages that the bilingual query is 
completely matched. It is computed as the fol-
lowing formula.

total number of returned web pages for query iq . 
Candidate Inclusion Ratio for Monolingual 
Query and Mix-language Query This feature is 
defined as the percentage of the returned web 
pages that the candidate translation is completed 
matched. This feature for monolingual query is 
computed as formula 13, and this feature for 
mix-language query is computed as formula 14.

At last the revised candidate translation set is 
re-ranked according to this formula, and the top-
K results are outputted as the input?s translation 
results.  
4 Parameters Evaluations 
In above formula (4), formula (11) and formula 
(15), the parameters i? are interpolation feature 
weights, which reflect the importance of different 
features. We use some held-our organization 
name pairs as development set to train these pa-
rameters. For those parameters in formula (4), we 
used those considered features solely one by one, 
and evaluated their importance according to their 
corresponding inclusion ratio of correct transla-
tions when using mix-language expansion and 
the final weights are assigned according to the 
following formula.

Where iInclusionRate  is the inclusion rate 
when considered feature if  only. The inclusion 
rate is defined as the percentage of correct trans-
lations that are contained in the returned web 
pages as Huang et al[2005] did. 
To obtain the parameters in formula (11), we 
used those considered features solely one by one, 
and computed their corresponding precision on 
development set respectively, and final weights 
are assigned according to following formula.

mula (15), their assignment method is the same 
with the method used for formula (11). 
5 Experiments and Discussions 
We use a Chinese to English organization name 
translation task to evaluate our approach. The 
experiments consist of four parts. Firstly, we 
evaluate the contribution of the correlative 
named entities for obtaining the web pages that 
contain the correct translation of the input. Sec-
ondly, we evaluate the contribution of different 
query expansion methods. Thirdly, we investi-
gate to which extents our approach can solve the 
two problems mentioned in section 1. Finally, we 
evaluate how much our approach can improve 
the overall recall and precision. Note that for 
simplicity, we use 10-best outputs from Moses as 
the original candidate translations for every input. 
And the search engine used here is Live7. 
5.1 Test Set 
The test set consists of 247 Chinese organization 
names recognized from 2,000 web pages that are 
downloaded from Sina8. These test organization 
names are translated by a bilingual speaker given 
the text they appear in. And these translations are 
verified from their official government web 
pages respectively. During translation, we don?t 
use any contextual information. 
5.2 Contribution of Correlative Named En-
tities 
The contribution of correlative named entities is 
evaluated by inclusion rate, and we compare the 
inclusion rate with different amount of correla-
tive named entities and different amount of re-
turned web pages. The experimental results are 
shown in Table 1 (here we use all these three 
kinds of expanding strategies).  
# of correlative named enti-
ties used

pages used

Table 1. Comparisons of inclusion rate  
From these results we can find that our ap-
proach obtains an inclusion rate of 82% when we 
use 10 correlative named entities and 10 returned 
web pages. We notice that there are some Chi-
nese organization names whose correct English 
translations have multiple standards. For exam-
ple,  the organization name ?????is translated

into ?Department of Defense? when it refers to a 
department in US, but  is translated into ?Minis-
try of Defence? when it refers to a department in 
UK or in Singapore. This problem affects the 
actual inclusion rate of our approach. Another 
factor that affects the inclusion rate is the search 
engine used. There is a small difference in the 
inclusion rate when different search engines are 
used. For example, the Chinese organization 
name ?????/China CITIC Bank?, because 
the word ???? is an out-of-vocabulary word,  
the best output from Moses is ?of the bank?. 
With such candidate translation, none of our 
three expansion methods works. But when we 
used Google as search engine instead, we mined 
the correct translation. 
From these results we can conclude that by us-
ing correlative named entities, the returned web 
pages are more likely to contain the correct trans-
lations of the input organization names. 
5.3 Contribution of Three Query Expansion 
Methods 
In this section, we evaluate the contribution of 
these three query expansion methods respectively. 
To do this, we use them one by one during trans-
lation, and compare their inclusion rates respec-
tively. Experimental results are shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Inclusion rate of different kinds of query 
expansion methods 
From Table 2 we can see that bilingual expan-
sion and mix-language expansion play greater 
roles than monolingual expansion in obtaining 
the web pages that contain the correct transla-
tions of the inputs. This is because the condition 
of generating monolingual queries is too strict, 
which requires a reliable translation for the cor-
relative named entity. In most cases, this condi-
tion cannot be satisfied. So for many input or-
ganization names, we cannot generate any mono-
lingual queries for them at all. This is the reason 
why monolingual expansion obtains so poorer an 
inclusion rate compared with the other two ex-
pansions. To evaluate the true contribution of 
monolingual expansion method, we carry out 
another experiment. We select 10 organization 
names randomly from the test set, and translate 
all of their correlative named entities into English 
by a bilingual speaker. Then we evaluate the in-
clusion rate again on this new test set. The ex-
perimental results are shown in Table 3. 
# of correlative named enti-
ties used 
 
1 5 10 
1 0.2 0.3 0.6 
5 0.4 0.7 0.9 
#of web 
pages used
10    0.4 0.8 0.9 
Table 3. Inclusion rate for monolingual expan-
sion on new test set 
From Table 3 we can conclude that, if most of 
the correlative named entities can be reliably 
translated, the queries generated by this mono-
lingual expansion will play greater role in obtain-
ing the web pages that contain the correct trans-
lations of the inputs. 
From those results in Table 2 we can conclude 
that, these three kinds of expansions complement 
each other. Using them together can obtain 
higher inclusion rate than using anyone of them 
only. 
5.4 Efficiency on Solving Problem I and 
Problem II 
In this section, we investigate to which extents 
our approach can solve the two problems men-
tioned in section 1.We compare the wrong trans-
lation numbers caused by these two problems 
(another main kind of translation error is caused 
by the translation of out-of-vocabulary words) 
between Moses and our approach. The experi-
mental results are shown in Table 4.  
 Moses Results Our method
Problem I 44 3 
Problem II 30 0 
Table 4. Comparison of error numbers 
From Table 4 we can see that our approach is 
very effective on solving these two problems. 
Almost all of the errors caused by these two 
problems are corrected by our approach. Only 
three wrong translations are not corrected. This is 
because that there are some Chinese organization 
names whose correct English translations have 
multiple standards, such as the correct translation 
of organization name ?????depends on its 
nationality, which has been explained in section 
5.2.

5.5 Our Approach vs. Other Approaches  
In this section, we compare our approach with 
other two methods: Moses and the approach pro-
posed by Huang et al [2005]. We compare their 
accuracy of Top-K results. For both our approach 
and Huang et al?s approach, we use 10 correla-
tive words for each input organization name and 
use 10 returned web pages for mining the correct 
translation result. The experimental results are 
shown in Table 5.

Top 5 0.18 0.61 0.73 
Top 10 0.31 0.68 0.79 
Table 5. Moses results vs. our results 
Moses is a state-of-the-art translation method, 
but it can hardly handle the organization name 
translation well. In addition to the errors caused 
by the above two problems mentioned in section 
1, the out-of-vocabulary problem is another ob-
stacle for Moses. For example, when translating 
the organization name ?????????
/International Tsunami Information Centre?, be-
cause the word ???? is an out-of-vocabulary 
word, Moses fails to give correct translation. But 
for those approaches that have a web mining 
process during translation, both the out-of-
vocabulary problem and the two problems men-
tioned in section 1 are less serious. This is the 
reason that Moses obtains the lowest perform-
ance compared with the other two approaches. 
Our approach is also superior to Huang?s method, 
as shown in the above table. We think this is be-
cause of the following three reasons. The first 
reason is that in our approach, we use a transla-
tion candidate generation process. Although 
these candidates are usually not so good, they 
can still provide some very useful clue informa-
tion for the web retrieval process. The second 
reason is that the features considered for correla-
tive words extraction in our approach are more 
comprehensive. Most of the time (except for the 
case that the input is not included in the correla-
tive word list) our approach is more prone to ob-
tain better correlative words for the input. The 
third reason is that our approach use more query 
expansion strategies than Huang?s approach. 
These expansion strategies may complement 
each other and improve the probability of obtain-
ing the web pages that contain the correct trans-
lations For example, both Moses and Huang?s 
approach failed to translate the organization 
name ??????????. But in our approach, 
with the candidate translation ?International In-
formation Centre? that is generated by Moses, 
our approach still can obtain the web page that 
contains the correct translation when using bilin-
gual expansion. Thus the correct translation ?In-
ternational Tsunami Information Centre? is 
mined out during the sequent mining process.  
From table 5 we also notice that the final re-
call of our approach is a little lower than the in-
clusion rate as show in table 1. This means that 
our approach doesn?t mine all the correct transla-
tions that are contained in the returned web pages. 
One of the reasons is that some of the input or-
ganization names are not clearly expressed. For 
example, an input organization name ?????
??, although its correct translation ?University 
of California, Berkeley? is contained in the re-
turned web pages, this correct translation cannot 
be mined out by our approach. But if it is ex-
pressed as ??????????????, its 
correct translation can be mined from the re-
turned web pages easily. Besides, the recognition 
errors of NER toolkits will also reduce the final 
recall of our approach.  
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we present a new organization 
name translation approach. It uses some correla-
tive named entities of the input and some query 
expansion strategies to help the search engine to 
retrieve those web pages that contain the correct 
translation of the input. Experimental results 
show that for most of the inputs, their correct 
translations are contained in the returned web 
pages. By mining these correct translations and 
re-ranking them, the two problems mentioned in 
section 1 are solved effectively. And recall and 
precision are also improved correspondingly.  
In the future, we will try to improve the ex-
traction perform of correlative named entities. 
We will also try to apply this approach to the 
person name translation and location name trans-
lation.
