Abstract
Advances in natural language generation and
speech processing techniques, combined with
changes in the commercial landscape, have
brought within reach dramatic improvements
in Augmentative Alternative Communication
(AAC). These improvements, though over-
whelmingly positive, amplify a family of per-
sonal data use problems. This paper argues
that the AAC design and implementation pro-
cess needs to identify and address personal
data use problems. Accordingly, this paper
explores personal data management problems
and proposes responses. This paper is situated
in the context of AAC technology but the re-
sponses could be generalised for other com-
munities affected by low digital literacy, low
literacy levels and cognitive challenges.
1 Introduction
Electronic Augmentative and Alternative Commu-
nication (AAC) systems enable individuals with se-
vere speech impairment to verbally communicate
their needs, often using Text-to-Speech technology.
Such devices are designed to give communication
impaired people greater independence and improved
opportunities of social integration. The devices en-
able users to construct utterances, many of which de-
scribe themselves or aspects of their lives, including
their actions with others and, as such, can be con-
sidered ?personal data?. Recent work by Patel and
Radhakrishnan (2007), Black et al (2010), Reiter
et al (2009), and Reddington and Tintarev (2011)
makes explicit use of personal data (about both the
user and other parties) to improve the functionality
of AAC devices. Depending on context, the use of
these utterances, in an institutional setting, may be
controlled under data protection legislation, or (e.g.
domestically) their use may be influenced more by
social norms within the context. A key factor in per-
sonal data management is the highly contextual na-
ture of privacy related issues; privacy concerns and
practices are situated in their context (Nissenbaum,
2009) and influenced by cultural issues (Milberg et
al., 2000).
The diversity of technology in the AAC sector
is set to increase dramatically. Apple?s iPad1 has
caused a huge investment in tablet technology. Mul-
tiple, third party applications (e.g. proloque2go2,
myVoice3, and verbally4) already exist that allow
this new range of tablets to function as AAC devices.
The effect of this research movement maturing
at a time when many new devices and producers
are entering the market foreshadows probable ma-
jor changes and innovations in coming years. This
includes a risk of the ?panoply of different privacy
problems? that privacy theorist Solove (2008) fore-
saw as a result of diversifying and enhancing tech-
nologies.
The authors? position is that it is very timely to
explore personal data management problems in this
new AAC landscape and in so doing identify traps
that AAC design might stumble into as this technol-
ogy change gathers pace. This perspective can con-

tribute to the design of technologies and governance
structures that are able to both identify and respond
to such traps.
As AAC devices are designed to be used in all ar-
eas of the AAC user?s life, there are a broad range
of personal data management problems, which are
highly context sensitive and incorporate legal, so-
cial, and technical issues. This complex problem
space centres on informational privacy issues that
contribute to a wider family of personal data man-
agement problems that can be found in contexts of
AAC use.
This paper situates the personal data management
problems in the use of natural language generation
and speech processing techniques in AAC. It consid-
ers all of the following as personal data: utterances
constructed by the system, communication logs and
re-communication of stored utterances. Following
an overview of state-of-the-art AAC and discussion
of how functionality development in next-generation
AAC devices maps to the use of personal data, Sec-
tion 2 identifies and explores personal data use prob-
lems in three AAC-specific examples. Section 3
presents possible responses to problems introduced
by the examples and Section 4 considers a gov-
ernance framework that enables emergent personal
data management problems with future AAC de-
vices to be identified and considers its applicability
for other communities.
1.1 Personal data generated, and used, by AAC
devices
Today, AAC devices may excel at needs-based com-
munication (e.g. ?I am hungry?, ?I?m cold?, ?get
the phone?) but they are limited for real conversa-
tion (Soto et al, 2006). So, in the current genera-
tion of AAC devices, the implications for both per-
sonal data generation and its use are relatively small
because the linguistic capabilities are small. Typi-
cal AAC devices tend towards a hierarchical struc-
ture of pages, each of which typically focuses on a
context (e.g. shopping) or a category (e.g. clothes,
sports), rather than observations or recent personal
stories (Beukelman and Mirenda, 2005). However,
Higginbotham et al (2007) report that spontaneous
conversation with typical devices is slow and diffi-
cult (new utterances are typically constructed at a
rate of between 8 and 10 words per minute, slightly
more if e.g. word prediction is used). Todman et
al. (2008) propose utterance-based devices in which
devices focus on prepared phrases to facilitate social
communication rather than needs-based communi-
cation; however, in general, new utterances must be
prepared in advance either by the user or a carer,
with a large time and energy cost. It is this im-
plementation of functionality designed to speed up
utterance production that restricts the production of
personal data rather than the underlying technology.
A study by Rackensperger et al (2005) shows that
using pre-programmed phrases can reduce the abil-
ity for self-expression; as a result, the range of per-
sonal data produced is likely to be limited. As an
example, there is a particular difficulty in commu-
nicating recent or single use events such as talking
about one?s day or talking about yesterday?s tele-
vision: such utterances are expensive to prepare in
advance due to the potential for limited and low-
probability use. Thus, AAC users tend to be pas-
sive, responding to questions with single words or
short sentences, and personal stories tend to be told
as a monologue or a sequence of pre-stored utter-
ances (Soto et al, 2006).
To develop the potential for interaction, and there-
fore increase the degree to which AAC devices can
support increased independence, recent research has
examined the potential for location-aware devices
to offer different content to the user under differ-
ent conditions (Dominowska et al, 2002; Patel and
Radhakrishnan, 2007), and for devices that generate
new phrases automatically. In the later case: Black
et al (2010) use external data to populate a commu-
nication device, and Reiter et al (2009) use a NLG
engine to generate text from a database of personal
facts. These innovations could allow users to in-
crease social interaction and reduce the device main-
tenance, complementing the growing range of AAC
systems with internet connectivity.
1.1.1 Impact on personal data
As the capability for interaction increases, the po-
tential for increased personal data also increases.
For example:
? utterances generated from geo-location enabled
devices can potentially include information
about people (data subjects) other than the
33
AAC user, as well as increased information
about the device users themselves;
? utterances generated from input by teachers,
care staff and parents can again potentially con-
tain information about other data subjects, as
well as increase the range of information about
device users themselves;
? internet access as a medium brings a range of
issues for personal data use in terms of the
methods used to broadcast and replay utter-
ances and it greatly increases the possibilities
for data input (potentially including informa-
tion about third parties) into the utterances;
? the general browsing facility of internet access
increases the ability of users to communicate
with the wider world, carrying with it a set
of personal data management and privacy is-
sues, much of which is the subject of on-going
research (Kani-Zabihi and Coles-Kemp, 2010;
Kumaraguru and Cranor, 2005; Spiekermann
and Cranor, 2009).
Increasing the potential for interaction and giving
more control to the AAC user will increase the range
of personal data generated and hence the range of
potential personal data use problems. Moreover,
the increased creation of novel utterances and wider
opportunity to relay such utterances potentially in-
crease intellectual property issues.
AAC devices are designed to increase social inter-
action in all settings and therefore the devices, and
their supporting approaches, must be equally effec-
tive in all situations. This is a challenge for any type
of personal data management that includes aspects
of privacy. Also, AAC users themselves develop
their uses and desires for communication (Rack-
ensperger et al, 2005). Therefore, any approach to
personal data management has to be highly context
sensitive and capable of responding to changing re-
quirements.
1.2 Related work in AAC literature
Although ethics in the context of complex disabil-
ities is well studied, there is little direct research
into privacy and personal data management issues
in AAC: much of the work is in small accompany-
ing sections to other research contributions and fo-
cuses directly on personal data dissemination. For
example, Smith (2005) notes that externally dis-
played lexicons (such as a communications board)
violate some aspects of privacy and proposes finding
ways to ensure that vocabulary can be delivered dis-
creetly without affecting access. Similarly, Black et
al. (2010) address privacy as part of a discussion of
security. Additionally, there is some meta-work that
looks at the ethics of research into AAC rather than
AAC itself: Pennington et al (2007) notes that the
data collected by AAC devices makes identification
of the individual trivial, especially when considering
the relatively small pool of users, a theme that is also
examined in work by Lesher et al (2000) on logging
output of AAC devices.
Privacy has also been raised explicitly in the
AAC community by researchers considering de-
sign frameworks for next generation devices, e.g.,
Rackensperger et al (2005) and DeRuyter et al
(2007). There is also a growing body of AAC re-
search that, in discussing next generation AAC tech-
nology, raises a wide range of implicit issues re-
lated to privacy and ICT mediated communication.
These issues include: anonymity; personalisation of
services; identity management; autonomy; and the
changing of relationship boundaries through media-
tion. These are topics that feature in traditional pri-
vacy research, but with added complexity.
Therefore, work on the future of AAC and in-
ternet connectivity (in particular key features high-
lighted in DeRuyter et al (2007)) have great bear-
ing on personal data management, although privacy
and personal data management are not directly dis-
cussed. DeRuyter et al (2007) discuss simplified
usability, including ?embeddedness? functionality:
making AAC devices unobtrusive in their environ-
ment. When simplifying usability, there is a ten-
sion between requiring user intervention and deci-
sion making automation. For example, where should
consent mechanisms related to personal information
disclosure be placed?
Discussions on future AAC functionality also em-
phasise adaptive technology that personalises AAC
use so that AAC devices are able to recognise a user
and adjust functionality accordingly (DeRuyter et
al., 2007). However, adaptation algorithms designed
34
to anticipate or assess user capabilities will make ad-
justments to functionality based on logs of personal
data and usage patterns and thus implicitly process
personal data. The ability to adjust such algorithms
would give users and their carers increased control
over the use of this personal data. In addition, adjust-
ing the capabilities of Internet-enabled AAC devices
is likely to also result in changes to the disclosure
of a user?s personal data. This disclosure would be
determined using a logic internal to the adaptation
algorithms. Making the logic explicit to users and
their carers would make both the personal data dis-
closure implications of adjustment visible and give
greater control over disclosure.
2 Examples
Given the situated nature of informational privacy,
in order to explore personal data management is-
sues meaningfully, it is vital to situate the evalua-
tion policy and its related personal data management
issues into a particular context. We have selected
three AAC-specific examples through which to ex-
plore the issues in particular contexts.
This section describes three illustrative scenarios
for potential personal data use problems. They are
broadly based on the categories of generated con-
tent in Reddington and Tintarev (2011) and are con-
structed with input from legal experts, youth work
practitioners, and disability officers. The examples
situate the personal data management problems be-
fore analysis in Section 3.
2.1 Example 1 - Creating Novel Utterances
The simplest, and least intrusive level of automati-
cally generated content contains inferred utterances
that can be deduced from logs of previous utter-
ances. Thus, if a device logged the phrase ?Hello
Mary? and later ?Thanks Mary? the phrase ?Today I
spent time with Mary? could be added to the list of
available phrases. It is trivial to imagine other pos-
sible situations where this is applicable - ?My com-
munications unit has been away for repair?, ?I was
up very late last night?, and ?I like to talk about foot-
ball?, are all deducible from previous utterances.
We consider an AAC user Alice, who is solely
reliant on her AAC device for communication and
is non-literate. Alice is able to generate novel ut-
terances using utterance segments programmed by
care staff and by taking advantage of inferred utter-
ances that her device has been designed to provide.
Alice has the right to delete certain utterances but
care staff and family members are able to restore the
deleted utterances. The digest of Alice?s activities
are backed up every day and could be placed in a
catalogue of utterances that the care provider uses at
promotional events or on the provider?s website.
This scenario raises issues related to intellectual
property rights, ownership, and the management of
personal data. The management issues centre on
control of data, and rights to recover deleted items.
2.2 Example 2 - Implicit and Explicit Personal
Data Exchange Rules
The second and third levels of automatically gen-
erated content involve receiving data from network
portals (such as the internet) and local sensors. For
example: ?It?s very warm today?, and ?It rained
on Friday!?. Also included is media data: ?On
YouTube I watched the ?Star Wars Kid? video ?, or
?New series of Doctor Who!?.
A useful context here is the ?How was School To-
day...?? (HWST) project (Black et al, 2010; Red-
dington and Tintarev, 2011), which generates stories
for students with complex communication needs at
a special needs school. The project logs interactions
with people, objects and location changes. This sen-
sor data is supplemented with timetable information
(to infer classes based on time and location) and
voice recordings, before new content is generated.
Consider that Alice is in a class and that her AAC
device reads information from sensors to generate
novel content in a similar way to the HWST sys-
tem. Also in class is Charlie, a typically developing
child. Charlie?s actions are also recorded by the sen-
sors and he takes part in activities with Alice. Al-
ice is able to report Charlie?s behaviour to her par-
ents and to other class members. Unlike when her
classmate Charlie verbally communicates about his
school day, Alice?s utterances take a permanent form
and can be replayed and reused. Charlie is not really
aware of this capability and what this means. Char-
lie?s parents are aware that Alice has some kind of
communication device and that sensors are used at
school but are not clear on the details. Alice?s Mum
puts some of Alice?s stories, including the one about
35
Figure 1: An example information flow
Charlie and the water fight, up on their family blog.
This scenario raises issues of consent to obtain
data from sensor sources and of processing the sen-
sor data. It also raises questions related to the dis-
semination of personal data - about the user and
other data subjects. In this scenario, personal data is
processed in two contexts: school and Alice?s home.
This shows the complex array of stakeholders in-
volved in managing personal data. Moreover, there
are questions of how non-AAC users are informed
of the implications of AAC use in the school or in
any other setting. Implicitly there is a problem of
ensuring that AAC and non-AAC users are treated
equally in terms of the personal data rights, which in
turn raises issues of how verbal and AAC generated
utterances are valued in the social context.
2.3 Example 3 - Control over Data Sharing
An additional level of complexity is the creation of
narrative flow. Narratives are groups of messages
that together relate an experience or tell a story. This
adds the problem of creating a narrative structure
and consistent style to the data-mining exercise (for
NLG work on the importance of narrative informa-
tion exchange see e.g. (Reiter et al, 2008)). An
example might be:
I had my breakfast quickly because I was
excited to go to the arcade. I got on the
bus, I went to the arcade, I played in the
arcade and won a cuddly bear.
Now consider that Alice and Charlie are joined
by Bob, who is also an AAC user on the same sys-
tem as Alice. Alice and Bob?s devices are capable of
sharing data at all levels. At the device level, Alice
and Bob share raw data to confirm, for example, that
their system clocks are in sync and that they have the
same records of people who are in the same room. It
is also possible at the social episode level that Al-
ice?s system can import utterances from Bob?s sys-
tem so that Alice could say ?Bob liked the swim-
ming?. It is important to note that in this scenario,
if Alice deletes an utterance from her machine ?The
teacher gave me a bad mark on my work?, Bob could
still use the deleted story because Alice is unable to
delete the disseminations. However, data sharing is
not only between device users. Data sharing could
also take place between the agencies involved in Al-
ice and Bob?s care and support. Figure 1 shows this
data sharing taking place on three levels: device, in-
dividual AAC user, and institutional.
This scenario raises the issues of personal data
flow control and indicates that controls for the flow
of personal data have to be set at all three levels.
Importantly, when personal data flows are managed
at these levels responses will always be sociotech-
nical in nature; therefore they include technical re-
sponses, governance responses and technology prac-
tice responses. This is a familiar combination of re-
36
sponses in privacy management (Paine et al, 2007)
3 Finding traps and responding to them
Section 2 demonstrated a family of personal data use
problems. These problems address various aspects
of using personal data in the context of AAC de-
vices. Our family of problems partly relate to the
oft used definition of privacy from Westin (1967):
?the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to
determine for themselves when, how, and to what
extent information about them is communicated to
others?. This is not a hierarchy with a root problem
and a tree structure of related problems but a fam-
ily of problems with complex relations and which
are enmeshed rather than conceptually linear. An-
alytically, the family has four members: IPR; com-
pliance responsibility; institutional personal data ac-
cess and disclosure rights; and individual personal
data access and disclosure rights. Each family mem-
ber is addressed in this section. Whitley points out
that Whitley (2009) ?Wittgenstein (1956) tells us
that language is a social activity and hence that spe-
cialised terms like privacy are arrived at socially.?.
The social construction of concepts related to per-
sonal data mean that personal data issues will be en-
meshed in particular contexts and, as a result, the
significance of these issues will vary from context to
context.
Discussions with legal experts and practitioners
(see Acknowledgements) revealed that responses to
these problems occur at the institutional, individ-
ual, and technical levels, and an individual inter-
pretation of personal data management issues under-
pins all responses. This is true of all personal data
management issues; however, in the case of AAC
users, the individual level will be a unique combina-
tion of AAC user, family, and care workers. At the
next level is the sociocultural system in place within
each institutional context, which contains the per-
sonal data management policies, procedures, prac-
tices and institutional values. This sociocultural sys-
tem is supported by technological controls used to
control personal data information flow.
Unlike spoken conversation, AAC devices create
embodiments of conversations that can be perma-
nently stored or logged. Then conversations become
data that largely focuses on living individuals, ei-
ther the users themselves or their family and friends.
Under certain conditions processing this data will be
regulated by data protection legislation. In other set-
tings the processing will be governed more by so-
cial norms. Furthermore, the permanent nature of
these embodiments means that they can carry copy-
right. Then there is a natural question of informa-
tion flow control, the need for rights management
and traditional information security issues such as
confidentiality and access control. However, privacy
is also an elastic concept (Allen, 1988) and is often
considered wider than the Westin definition, includ-
ing aspects of identity and relationship management.
As the work of Smith (2005) and Rackensperger
et al (2005) shows, use of AAC devices is related
to notions of self and relationship to others. The
notions of self and relationship to others are a cen-
tral aspect of privacy (Kani-Zabihi and Coles-Kemp,
2010) (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden, 2010) and the
link between personal data use and privacy and iden-
tity issues should not be ignored when considering
these personal data management problems.
3.1 A Family of Personal Data Use Problems
Practically, any technical, regulatory, or social re-
sponse to personal data use issues in AAC must be
able to operate in a range of contexts and support a
user as they blend and adjust contexts. For example,
an AAC user may use their device at home, in formal
education, in youth group activities, and in social
settings. These different contexts may include many
of the same people, but the personal data control
requirements and the regulatory and personal data
management frameworks are likely to differ from
context to context. A further level of complexity in
the case of AAC users is that capabilities and back-
grounds differ widely within the AAC community
(DeRuyter et al, 2007) and any personal data man-
agement approach has to adjust to these varying ca-
pabilities and different perspectives.
Technical responses would primarily be formed
by meshing the AAC functionality into the underly-
ing technical architecture of each device. Technical
responses include personal information flow control
over the network; encryption of sensitive utterances,
e.g. health or financial information (such as credit
card numbers), stored on the AAC device; access
control to location databases and so on.
37
3.1.1 Management of IPR
Automatically generated text in AAC devices can
be coupled or merged with input from other sources,
increasing the ability of users to develop additional
novel utterances. Given the digital nature of the ut-
terances, there is potentially a close comparison with
music copyright, which has three sets of rights: me-
chanical, rights related to the creation of the lyrics
and performing. Using music copyright as the paral-
lel, consider the situation where an AAC user, Alice
say, imports text from a novel under copyright (me-
chanical rights) and adapts it by adding other text
and other copyright material in order to create her
own monologue (intellectual property rights). An-
other AAC user, Bob say, then downloads Alice?s
monologue and performs it through his AAC de-
vice at a concert for a school (performing rights).
Clearly the majority of instances carry an implicit
rights clearance, particularly in the content and per-
forming rights elements of this example. However,
if the monologue was posted on YouTube and then
became sampled by a recording artist or made into a
digital novel, rights clearance may not apply. Com-
municating the rules relating to copyright and ensur-
ing understanding can be problematic.
Social and institutional responses to IPR prob-
lems are largely related to awareness training and
the agreement of ?ground rules? or social contracts in
communities such as schools and youth clubs where
the legal issues and social expectations are made
clear. The traditional methods for negotiating and
agreeing ground rules is heavily based on the use of
informational literature, one-to-one and group dis-
cussion (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden, 2010). These
methods do not translate well into an environment
where users may have cognitive development issues,
or may be non-literate. It could be envisaged that
guardians and parents would be used to negotiate
and agree the ground rules and then left with the
task of communicating the ground rules to their de-
pendents. The difficulty in this is that at the same
time, AAC users can become very skilled in the
use of technology and may well develop practices
that involve copyright material, in a way that their
guardians have not been able to communicate effec-
tively. In order to respond to this mismatch of ca-
pabilities, methods of engagement need to be sought
that ensure AAC users are as integral as possible to
the establishment of such rules.
3.1.2 Management of compliance responsibility
Due to the digital nature of AAC utterances, per-
sonal data output by a device is regulated by data
protection legislation when being processed in the
context of institutions such as schools, health, or so-
cial service. In the UK, this legislation is the Data
Protection Act 1998. Under the Act there are eight
principles of personal data management and the re-
quirement that there must be a data controller who
is responsible for compliance with the legislation.
The term ?data subject? denotes individuals to whom
the personal data relates. If Alice and Bob were
young adults with sufficient cognitive abilities they
would likely be the data controllers. However, as
speech, language and communication disabilities are
regularly a pan-disability, Alice and Bob may also
be cognitively impaired and a parent or guardian is
likely to be regarded as the data controller.
Typically, the mechanism for specifying compli-
ance requirements is via the creation of a compli-
ance schedule. In the case of AAC use, a compliance
schedule for AAC devices is likely to be between the
institution (school or health services) and the par-
ents. The compliance schedule would establish the
responsibility for data processing and agree the rela-
tionship between parents and institutions. Note that
the AAC user?s capabilities for technology can po-
tentially exceed that of their guardians and parents.
The relationship the AAC user has to the technol-
ogy is quite possibly very different from that of the
parent or guardian. If effective compliance manage-
ment is to be achieved, new engagement methods
need to be sought to ensure that AAC users are ac-
tively engaged in the establishment of compliance
schedules. The connection between the individual,
the institution (school) and privacy legislation is il-
lustrated in Figure 2.
3.1.3 Management of institutional personal
data access and disclosure rights
A set of rights must be agreed as part of the com-
pliance schedule when AAC devices are used in
school and healthcare settings. Many AAC devices
have their data backed up to a central database. An
38
Figure 2: This diagram adapts the characterisation of in-
stitutional culture found in (Allaire and Firsirotu, 1984)
issue arises as to who has the right to back up or ac-
cess the AAC data. AAC devices that can restore
data that a user has deleted raise particular prob-
lems, which relate to who has the right to restore the
data and the subsequent disclosure rights that this
individual would have. Problems also occur as to
whether other AAC users have the right to down-
load content from another AAC device and the sub-
sequent disclosure rights that this would afford.
AAC users will typically have considerable inter-
vention from education and health support workers.
Unlike spoken forms of conversations in other care
situations, AAC utterances have a digital embodi-
ment. This allows different teams in the care, ed-
ucation and support of the user to easily share ut-
terances, and it may be deemed to make care more
effective to do so. From an institutional perspective,
data sharing policies should be set up to state which
aspects of AAC utterances can be shared, the people
that such utterances can be shared with, and a need
for transparency in the logic used to interpret the ut-
terances. In addition, the compliance schedule could
specify which data transfers are permitted.
3.1.4 Management of individual personal data
access and disclosure rights
Whilst many institutional issues are related to per-
sonal data use, importantly, AAC users are likely to
use devices for personal data disclosure outside of
the institutional context as part of family and social
life. In this instance processing is controlled by so-
cial norms and practices that could be considered a
social contract (Milne and Gordon, 1993).
From a social perspective, developing social con-
tracts or norms organically responds to problems re-
lated to publishing of data about other data subjects,
misuse of the AAC user?s personal data by friends
and family, and unintentional copyright infringe-
ments. In the scenario of AAC use, these social con-
tracts and norms are re-enforced with education and
awareness briefings (Bogdanovic et al, 2009) that
are typically driven by the education and health in-
stitutions. As part of these ground rules, the degree
of anonymity in any disclosures and the rights of
non-AAC users to have their personal data removed
from an AAC device are agreed or follow a socially
accepted path. From a technical perspective, the de-
vice interface could be developed to include utter-
ances about information disclosure and feelings of
privacy. The log files could also include information
disclosure and processing comments that practition-
ers and family members might wish to discuss or
consider. Role play games could also be considered
as a way of re-enforcing and encouraging ground
rules.
4 AAC personal data management
framework
As illustrated in Figure 2, personal data manage-
ment within the AAC context is complex and any
response to a personal data management problem
has both technical, governance and cultural aspects.
These responses have to be adaptive to differing lev-
els of capabilities and different contextual require-
ments. Any technical response has to be scalable to
enable users with different privacy and technical re-
quirements to have access to their personal data con-
trolled accordingly so that, where practical, users are
able to have some control over their personal data.
This scaleability can, in part, be addressed by the de-
sign and implementation of the personal data man-
agement framework.
39
4.1 Extending the existing framework
The personal data management problems related to
AAC use have links with work in the mainstream
privacy and consent research communities. Sec-
tion 2 illustrates that AAC use adds additional lay-
ers of complexity to privacy and consent issues and,
as a result, adds additional requirements to any per-
sonal data management framework. Due to space
constraints the factors are merely highlighted to note
that each is a large piece of research in its own right.
The required extensions fall into three areas:
4.1.1 Technical capability
Technical capability, in addition to education, is a
factor in assessing ability to manage privacy (Coles-
Kemp et al, 2010; Kumaraguru and Cranor, 2005;
Buchanan et al, 2007) because a relatively sophisti-
cated level of technical capability is required to im-
plement the privacy controls. Technical capability
and education levels are likely to be lower, on aver-
age, in AAC users.
4.1.2 Family roles
AAC users typically remain ?scaffolded? by fam-
ily and the family will therefore remain involved in
decisions about personal data disclosure. Whilst,
family plays an important role at the start of an indi-
vidual?s internet journey5, typically this intervention
recedes over time and the design of privacy controls
does not traditionally cater for varying levels of user
independence in decision making. This needs to be
addressed by the management framework.
4.1.3 Governance system design
Responses to personal data management issues
use a governance system composed of policy, reg-
ulation, and practices to support the use of pri-
vacy enhancing technologies. Engagement with
such a system is notoriously inconsistent because of
language and conceptual complexities (Kani-Zabihi
and Coles-Kemp, 2010; Bogdanovic et al, 2009;
Bonnici and Coles-Kemp, 2010; McDonald and
Cranor, 2008; McDonald and Cranor, 2009). It is
reasonable to assume that such a governance sys-
tem would require specific modifications for the
5UK online Centres (2010) ?Digital engagement un-
derstanding customers?, a study (available for download at
www.ukonlinecentres.com/research/research/centres-research)
AAC community to make policies more understand-
able, to allow for adaptations in privacy and internet
safety education and to enable the role of family in
decision support. However, it should also be kept
in mind that similar modifications could be made
for other communities with lower levels of digital
literacy, literacy and cognitive challenges. Whilst
the problems themselves are AAC-specific and the
problems are brought about, in part, by the direction
of development of AAC technology, the governance
responses respond to underlying problems found in
a range of communities.
5 Conclusions
Advances in text-to-speech technology and mobile
computing have made a range of AAC devices avail-
able to the public. Advances in natural language
generation and speech processing techniques have
co-incided with changes to the commercial land-
scape to bring dramatic advances in AAC capabil-
ities within reach. These advances in AAC design,
though overwhelmingly positive, do result in a fam-
ily of personal data use problems that were not en-
countered with previous generations of the devices.
This paper argued that AAC devices can only signifi-
cantly support users with communication difficulties
to achieve greater independence and social inclusion
if their design and implementation both addresses
and identifies personal data problems.
