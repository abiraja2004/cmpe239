Abstract
This paper describes the Duluth systems that
participated in Task 2 of SemEval?2012.
These systems were unsupervised and relied
on variations of the Gloss Vector measure
found in the freely available software pack-
age WordNet::Similarity. This method was
moderately successful for the Class-Inclusion,
Similar, Contrast, and Non-Attribute cate-
gories of semantic relations, but mimicked a
random baseline for the other six categories.
1 Introduction
This paper describes the Duluth systems that par-
ticipated in Task 2 of SemEval?2012, Measuring
the Degree of Relational Similarity (Jurgens et al.,
2012). The goal of the task was to rank sets of
word pairs according to the degree to which they
represented an underlying category of semantic re-
lation. A highly ranked pair would be considered
a good or prototypical example of the relation. For
example, given the relation Y functions as an X the
pair weapon:knife (X:Y) would likely be considered
more representative of that relation than would be
tool:spoon.
The task included word pairs from 10 different
categories of relational similarity, each with a num-
ber of subcategories. In total the evaluation data
consisted of 69 files, each containing a set of ap-
proximately 40 word pairs. While training examples
were also provided, these were not used by the Du-
luth systems. The system?generated rankings were
compared with gold standard data created via Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk.
The Duluth systems relied on the Gloss Vec-
tor measure of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan
and Pedersen, 2006) as implemented in Word-
Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004)1. This quanti-
fies the degree of semantic relatedness between two
word senses. It does not, however, discover or in-
dicate the nature of the relation between the words.
When given two words as input (as was the case in
this task), it measures the relatedness of all possi-
ble combinations of word senses associated with this
pair and reports the highest resulting score. Note
that throughout this paper we use word and word
sense somewhat interchangeably. In general it may
be assumed that the term word or examples of words
refers to a word sense.
A key characteristic of this task was that the word
pairs in each of the 69 sets were scored assuming
a particular specified underlying semantic relation.
Given this, the limitation that the Gloss Vector mea-
sure does not discover the nature of relations was
less of a concern, and led to the hypothesis that a
word pair that was highly related would also be a
prototypical example of the underlying category of
semantic relation. Unfortunately the results from
this task do not generally support this hypothesis,
although for a few categories at least it appears to
have some validity.
This paper continues with a review of the Gloss
Vector measure, and explains its connections to the
Adapted Lesk measure. The paper then summarizes
the results of the three Duluth systems in this task,
and concludes with some discussion and analysis of
where this method had both successes and failures.

2 Semantic Relatedness
Semantic relatedness is a more general notion than
semantic similarity. We follow (Budanitsky and
Hirst, 2006) and limit semantic similarity to those
measures based on distances and perhaps depths in
a hierarchy made up of is?a relations. For exam-
ple, car and motorcycle are similar in that they are
connected via an is?a relation with vehicle. Seman-
tic similarity is most often applied to nouns, but can
also be used with verbs.
Two word senses can be related in many ways,
including similarity. car and furnace might be con-
sidered related because they are both made of steel,
and firefighter and hose might be considered related
because one uses the other, but neither pair is likely
to be considered similar. Measures of relatedness
generally do not specify the nature of the relation-
ship between two word senses, but rather indicate
that they are related to a certain degree in some un-
specified way. As a result, measures of relatedness
tend to be symmetric, so A is related to B to the same
degree that B is related to A. It should be noted that
some of the relations in Task 2 were not symmetric,
which was no doubt a complicating factor for the
Duluth systems.
3 Adapted Lesk Measure
The Gloss Vector measure was originally devel-
oped in an effort to generalize and improve upon
the Adapted Lesk measure (Banerjee and Pedersen,
2003).2 Both the Gloss Vector measure and the
Adapted Lesk measure start with the idea of a su-
pergloss. A supergloss is the definition (or gloss) of
a word sense that is expanded by concatenating it
with the glosses of other surrounding senses that are
connected to it via some WordNet relation. For ex-
ample, a supergloss for car might consist of the def-
inition of car, the definition of car?s hypernym (e.g.,
vehicle), and the definitions of the meronyms (part-
of) of car (e.g., wheel, brake, bumper, etc.) Other
relations as detailed later in this paper may also be
used to expand a supergloss.
In the Adapted Lesk measure, the relatedness be-
tween two word senses is a function of the number
and length of their matching overlaps in their super-
glosses. Consecutive words that match are scored
2WordNet::Similarity::lesk
more highly than single words, and a higher score
for a pair of words indicates a stronger relation. The
Adapted Lesk measure was developed to overcome
the fact that most dictionary definitions are rela-
tively short, which was a concern noted by (Lesk,
1986) when he introduced the idea of using defini-
tion overlaps for word sense disambiguation. While
the Adapted Lesk measure expands the size of the
definitions, there are still difficulties. In particular,
the matches between words in superglosses must be
exact, so morphological variants (run versus ran),
synonyms (gas versus petrol), and closely related
words (tree versus shrub) won?t be considered over-
laps and will be treated the same as words with no
apparent connection (e.g., goat and vase).
4 Gloss Vector Measure
The Gloss Vector measure3 is inspired by a 2nd or-
der word sense discrimination approach (Schu?tze,
1998) which is in turn related to Latent Semantic
Indexing or Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990). The
basic idea is to replace each word in a written con-
text with a vector of co-occurring words as observed
in some corpus. In this task, the contexts are def-
initions (and example text) from WordNet. A su-
pergloss is formed exactly as described for Adapted
Lesk, and then each word in the supergloss is re-
placed by a vector of co?occurring words. Then, all
the vectors in the supergloss are averaged together to
create a new high dimensional representation of that
word sense. The semantic relatedness between two
word senses is measured by taking the cosine be-
tween their two averaged vectors. The end result is
that rather than finding overlaps in definitions based
on exact matches, a word in a definition is matched
to whatever degree its co-occurrences match with
the co-occurrences of the words in the other super-
gloss. This results in a more subtle and fine grained
measure of relatedness than Adapted Lesk.
The three Duluth systems only differ in the re-
lations used to create the superglosses, otherwise
they are identical. The corpus used to collect co-
occurrence information was the complete collection
of glosses and examples from WordNet 3.0, which
consists of about 1.46 million word tokens and al-
most 118,000 glosses. Words that appeared in a
3WordNet::Similarity::vector
498
stop list of about 200 common words were excluded
as co-occurrences, as were words that occurred less
than 5 times or more than 50 times in the WordNet
corpus. Two words are considered to co-occur if
they occur in the same definition (including the ex-
ample) and are adjacent to each other. These are the
default settings as used in WordNet::Similarity.
5 Creating the Duluth Systems
There were three Duluth systems, V0, V1, and V2.
These all used the Gloss Vector measure, and differ
only in how their superglosses were created. The su-
pergloss is defined using a set of relations that indi-
cate which additional definitions should be included
in the definition for a sense. All systems start with
a gloss and example for each sense in a pair, which
is then augmented with definitions from additional
senses as defined for each system.
5.1 Duluth-V0
V0 is identical to the default configuration of the
Gloss Vector measure in WordNet::Similarity. This
consists of the following relations:
hypernym (hype) : class that includes a member,
e.g., a car is a kind of vehicle (hypernym).
hyponym (hypo) : the member of a class, e.g., a
car (hyponym) is a kind of vehicle.
holonym (holo) : whole that includes the part,
e.g., a ship (holonym) includes a mast.
meronym (mero) : part included in a whole, e.g.,
a mast (meronym) is a part of a ship.
see also (also) : related adjectives, e.g., egocentric
see also selfish.
similar to (sim) : similar adjectives, satanic is
similar to evil.
is attribute of (attr) : adjective related to a noun,
e.g., measurable is an attribute of magnitude.
synset words (syns) : synonyms of a word, e.g.,
car and auto are synonyms.4
For V0 the definition and example of a noun
is augmented with its synonyms and the defini-
tions and examples of any hypernyms, hyponyms,
meronyms, and holonyms to which it is directly con-
nected. If the word is a verb it is augmented with
4Since synonyms have the same definition, this relation aug-
ments the supergloss with the synonyms themselves.
its synonyms and any hypernyms/troponyms and hy-
ponyms to which it is directly connected. If the
word is an adjective then its definition and exam-
ple are augmented with those of adjectives directly
connected via see also, similar to, and is attribute of
relations.
5.2 Duluth-V1
V1 uses the relations in V0, plus the holonyms, hy-
pernyms, hyponyms, and meronyms (X) of the see
also, holonym, hypernym, hyponym, and meronym
relations (Y). This leads to an additional 20 relations
that bring in definitions ?2 steps? away from the
original word. These take the form of the holonym
of the hypernym of the word sense, or more gener-
ally the X of the Y of the word sense, where X and Y
are as noted above.
5.3 Duluth-V2
V2 uses the relations in V0 and V1, and then adds
the holonym, hypernyms, hyponyms, and meronyms
of the 20 relations added for V1. This leads to an
additional 80 relations of the form the hypernyms of
the meronym of the hyponym, or more generally the
X of the X of the Y of the word.
For example, if the word is weapon, then a hyper-
nym of the meronym of the hyponym (of weapon)
would add the definitions and example of bow (hy-
ponym), bowstring (meronym of the hyponym), and
cord (hypernym of the meronym of the hyponym) to
the gloss of weapon to create the supergloss.
6 Results
There were two evaluation scores reported for the
participating systems, Spearman?s Rank Correlation
Coefficient, and a score based on Maximum Differ-
ence Scaling. Since the Gloss Vector measure is
based on WordNet, there was a concern that a lack
of WordNet coverage might negatively impact the
results. However, of the 2,791 pairs used in the eval-
uation, there were only 3 that contained words un-
known to WordNet.
6.1 Spearman?s Rank Correlation
The ranking of word pairs in each of the 69 files
were evaluated relative to the gold standard using
Spearman?s Rank Correlation Coefficient. The av-
erage of these results over all 10 categories of se-

mantic relations was quite low. Random guessing
achieved an averaged Spearman?s value 0.018, while
Duluth-V0 scored 0.050, Duluth-V1 scored 0.039,
and Duluth-V2 scored 0.038.
However, there were specific categories where the
Duluth systems fared somewhat better. In particular,
results for category 1 (CLASS-INCLUSION), cate-
gory 3 (SIMILAR) and category 4 (CONTRAST)
represent improvements on the random baseline
(shown in Table 1) and at least some modest agree-
ment with the gold standard.
The results from the other categories were gener-
ally equivalent to what would be obtained with ran-
dom selection.
6.2 Maximum Difference Scaling
Maximum Difference Scaling is based on identify-
ing the least and most prototypical pair for a given
relation from among a set of four pairs. A ran-
dom baseline scores 31.2%, meaning that it got ap-
proximately 1 in 3 of the MaxDiff questions correct.
None of the Duluth systems improved upon random
to any significant degree : Duluth-V0 scored 32.4,
Duluth-V1 scored 31.5, and Duluth-V2 scored 31.1.
However, the same categories that did well with
Spearman?s also did well with MaxDiff (see Table
2). In addition, there is some improvement in cat-
egory 6 (NON-ATTRIBUTE) at least with MaxDiff
scoring.
7 Discussion and Conclusions
The Gloss Vector measure was able to perform rea-
sonably well in measuring the degree of relatedness
for the following four categories (where the defini-
tions come from (Bejar et al., 1991)):
CLASS-INCLUSION : one word names a class
that includes the entity named by the other word
SIMILAR : one word represents a different de-
gree or form of the ... other
CONTRAST : one word names an opposite or
incompatible of the other word
NON-ATTRIBUTE : one word names a quality,
property or action that is characteristically not an at-
tribute of the other word
Of these, CLASS-INCLUSION and SIMILAR
are well represented by the hypernym/hyponym re-
lations present in WordNet and used by the Gloss
Vector measure. WordNet?s greatest strength lies
in its hypernym tree for nouns, and that was most
likely the basis for the success of the CLASS-
INCLUSION and SIMILAR categories. While the
success with CONTRAST may seem unrelated, in
fact it may be that pairs of opposites are often quite
similar, for example happy and sad are both emo-
tions and are similar except for their polarity.
A number of the relations used in Task 2 are
not well represented in WordNet. For example,
there was a CASE RELATION which could ben-
efit from information about selectional restrictions
or case frames that just isn?t available in WordNet.
The same is true of the CAUSE-PURPOSE relation
as there is relatively little information about casual
relations in WordNet. While there are part-of rela-
tions in WordNet (meronyms/holonyms), these did
not prove to be common enough to be a significant
benefit for the PART-WHOLE relations in the task.
For many of the relations in the task the Gloss
Vector measure was most likely relying primarily on
hypernym and hyponym relations, which explains
the bias towards categories that featured similarity-
based relations. We are however optimistic that
a Gloss Vector approach could be more successful
given a richer set of relations from which to draw
information for superglosses.
