Abstract
This paper aims to bring a general overview
on the situation of Computational Linguistics
in Costa Rica, particularly in the academic
world.
1 Introduction
Costa Rica is a Central American country, well
known for the abolition of its army in 1949 and
for its policies in favor of the conservation of eco-
logically important areas. Investments in Education
brought a good development of several higher edu-
cational institutions, most of them public and open
to new students through an academic selection sys-
tem. As a consequence, one of the main products of
exportation is software (outsourcing, for example).
The growing importance of Computational Linguis-
tics (CL) in the last years has made developers to
start using CL technologies at work, but unfortu-
nately, often, they are on their own for the lack of
academic structures supporting development. In the
Table 1 and in the Figure 1 we provide comparative
data on Information and Communication Technolo-
gies (ICT) for Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico and the
United States both taken from the World Economic
Report for 2010 (Dutta and Mia, 2010), in order to
help the reader to get a better picture of the context
on which CL is growing up in Costa Rica.
This paper aims to bring a general account of CL
in Costa Rica. This article is divided into three parts.

Gabriela Barrantes, Prof. Hugo Mora Poltronieri and Prof. ?l-
varo de la Osa for their suggestions and comments. All the gaps
and mistakes in this paper are entirely mine.
The section 2 starts with some early CL articles in
Costa Rica before covering academic and research
infrastructure in the country. The section 4 briefly
acknowledges the presence of CL industries in the
country. Finally, the section 5 presents some of the
current tendencies in research and teaching. The
claims in this paper are not exhaustive and they only
represent the Author?s opinion, who aims to be as
objective as possible, but who does not have a com-
plete knowledge on the structures, institutions and
companies involved in computational issues in Costa
Rica. Therefore, all the topics are raised from per-
sonal interviews and experiences .
2 Academic infrastructure
Since the 90?s, CL raised interest in main academic
institutions in Costa Rica, particularly in the field of
Artificial Intelligence, but this interest was not con-
tinued and well structured in time. Some researchers
moved to other academic areas in computation or
even to industrial research. So, in the Instituto Tec-
nol?gico de Costa Rica1 (TEC) we found the first
citations related to CL, mainly on number recogni-
tion (Helo and Sell, 1995), knowledge representa-
tion (Araya, 1992), connectionism (Vargas, 1991)
and unification grammars (Vargas, 1992), these last
from a philosophical perspective.
In Costa Rica, we found more than 40 universities
and research institutes. But, computational research
in the country is principally done in the TEC and in
the University of Costa Rica.2 At this moment, CL

is mainly found in the University of Costa Rica as
part of the academic structure. This institution, as
far as we are concerned, has two structures cover-
ing research: schools and research institutions. The
former are mainly oriented towards teaching; the lat-
ter are exclusively devoted to research. CL teaching
is carried out in the School of Philology, Linguis-
tics and Literature3 and in its associated postgrad-
uate program on Linguistics4. Research is concen-
trated in the Instituto de Investigaciones Ling??sticas
(INIL)5 at the Facultad de Letras6. INIL is under
the administrative supervision of the Vicerrector?a
de Investigaci?n7, which approves project financing.
All the scientific responsability falls on the members
and commissions of the research institutions. At this
moment, CL is attached to INIL?s program ELEX-
HIC?S. Where a two year project is under develop-
ment, with the part time assistance of a researcher.
This project aims to create the bases for a hybrid
tutions.

parser.
In the Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingenier?a
(INII), we found a program on cognition and lan-
guage8. In spite of the name, their research ad-
dresses mostly behavioral issues.
There exists the possibility of getting funding
from governmental institutions, like CONARE9, but
they are meager. Nevertheless, it seems there are
good options within inter-university collaboration,
but this would require a long term coordination and
planification.
In Costa Rica, research funding can be improved
if real applications are proposed, for example edu-
cational and developmental tools. Other areas of in-
terest are indigenous and minority languages, like
Bribri and Chinese. In this sense, there are no com-
putational projects officially inscribed in INIL at this
moment, but ideas to start projects on this areas are
waiting for the next inauguration of the Natural Lan-
guage Processing Laboratory in the University of
Costa Rica, so there are no papers to cite for the mo-
ment. Nevertheless, any inquiry on indigenous lan-

3 Growing needs, growing interest
In the 90?s the project Estudios de Lexicograf?a
Hispano-Costarricense10 (ELEXHIC?S)11 at the
School of Philology, Linguistics and Literature of
the University of Costa Rica was born as an initia-
tive to do lexicographical research on contemporary
Costarican Spanish and to publish dictionaries based
on modern scientific methods and oriented towards
different publics and usages.
Lexicographical studies appeal to large corpora in
order to document accurate word values and guar-
antee their usefulness. The need of computational
resources was felt from the beginning of ELEX-
HIC?S. The Murillo and S?nchez (1993) on lexi-
cal and syntactic maturity (language acquisition) is
a good example of a research where this need of
language computational tools is present. However,
statistical dictionaries (Morales, 2009) can only be
done by electronic means because of the huge cal-
culations involved. For a long time, ELEXHIC?S
counted on the limited, but important, support of the
Centro de Inform?tica (Center of Informatics) of the
University of Costa Rica, but the need of developing
its own resources and technologies imposed itself.
In 2002 the School of Philology, Linguistics
and Literature of the University of Costa Rica
opened the course Tecnolog?a y Producci?n Tex-
tual12, where text processing technologies like
LATEX, XML, HTML, CSS and Perl are taught for
applications in the Humanities field. Some interest-
ing proof-of-concept projects have been proposed as
part of the course activities (Arroyo Molina, 2009;
Enciso Bahler, 2008; Fuentes Vargas, 2008). As
an initiative of ELEXHIC?S and the School of
Philology, Linguistics and Literature in order to de-
velop CL, the University of Costa Rica approved
a grant for a Ph.D. on Computational Linguistics,
which was fulfilled at the Laboratoire d?Analyse et
de Technologie du Langage13 of the University of

Geneva. As part of this initiative a full time Profes-
sorship on CL was opened for 2010 and since 2009
CL is taught as postgraduate facultative course for
the Master on Linguistics. Other courses on Formal
Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
were accepted and will be part of the offer in 2010.
Additionally, the School of Philology, Linguistics
and Literature approved the creation of a NLP labo-
ratory (project number 021-A9-734 of the Vicerrec-
tor?a de Investigaci?n, main resarcher, Prof. Jorge
Antonio Leoni de Le?n, assistant researcher, Prof.
Carla Jara Murillo), which is expected for 2010, and
should support research and teaching, especially be-
cause a course on data processing for undergraduate
students on Linguistics and Philology is under con-
sideration.
Computational graduate students have showed
their interest on CL courses at the Postgraduate Pro-
gram in Linguistics14. Some of them come to the
course looking for knowledge on CL, since because
of their jobs they need a good understanding of NLP
technologies. Although we lack of details about the
job they do with NLP, the works of Berrocal Rojas
(2009) and Cede?o Baltodano (2009) for the post-
graduate program on Computational Sciences illus-
trate the growing interest in the field. At the mo-
ment, only one student started, this year, her Mas-
ter?s thesis on CL at the Postgraduate Program on
Linguistics at the University of Costa Rica.
Off universities? campus, it?s important to men-
tion the Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnolog?a15 (CE-
NAT), which has projects sharing similarities with
CL, but with totally different aims. For example, we
can cite the projects on human memory modelisa-
tion (in collaboration with the Programa de Investi-
gaciones en Fundamentos de la Educaci?n a Distan-
cia, PROIFED, UNED) and an adaptation of com-
putational learning methods to a parallel and dis-
tributed processing platform. CENAT has contacts
with several organizations at international level. CE-
NAT is a state inter-university research institution on
super computation.

4 Commercial application of Language
Technologies
We are aware of postgraduate students working in
related areas in another countries, but we do not have
details about their plans for the future. Nevertheless,
national industry has not waited to have graduated
specialists in order to start the commercialization
of NLP related software. For example, Wordmagic
Software16 developed symbolic machine translation
software Spanish?English and Tecapro presented an
orthographic correction software17. Because of se-
crecy in the industry, it is difficult to know how many
companies appeal to NLP technologies. Enterprise
are also make themselves present in the field by sci-
entific grants, in 2007 Juan Rodr?guez won a prize
proposing a glove allowing translation between sign
language and Natural Langue.18
5 Research interests and collaboration
issues
Presently, the idea is that Computational Linguistics
would play a role, at different levels, in Lexicogra-
phy and Spanish as a second language (L2). This
leads to the creation of parsing systems and large
corpora, where collaboration is desired. Another in-
teresting area for CL is dialectology, where the tradi-
tion, as in Lexicography, of large collaborative ini-
tiatives exists. The new NLP laboratory will have
workstations exclusively dedicated to research and
the creation and storage of large copora as an inten-
sive international initiative could be possible.
The signing of specific collaborative agreements
between academic institutions is the preferred way
to accomplish international research projects. This
facilitates the approval of fundings.
6 Conclusions
In Costa Rica, CL is finding its path. At this moment
it is mainly an academic interest, but, as we saw,

there already are industrial products, where, eventu-
aly, graduated students could find professional em-
ployment.
In the University of Costa Rica, where CL is
rapidly growing up, collaborative initiatives are pos-
sible in a specifc and well defined frame. Addition-
ally, many students are coming to CL, with the new
academic offer. And this tendecy can increase in the
next years.
In this moment, there is no CL community in
Costa Rica. Before we are able to build it, we need to
create a solid ground where a CL community could
firmly stand up. This is starting to happen at the
University of Costa Rica, where individual initia-
tives begin to gather around the recent course on
CL taught by Prof. Jorge Antonio Leoni de Le?n.
We hope this movement will continue with the next
opening of the NLP Laboratory at the School of
Philology, Linguistics and Literature in the Univer-
sity of Costa Rica. This laboratory will fill the lack
of equipment to make research on CL. Nevertheless,
the need of a permanent research group will be there.
This is an understandable situation in the sense that
CL is a very new branch in the University and es-
pecially in liberal arts. This allows us to think that
students will incorporate to CL studies and projects
once the equipment and the offer on courses will be
normal. It is expected that this year (2010), School
of Philology, Linguistics and Literature will have a
full time professor on CL, who will dedicate at least
1
4 of his time to research.
