Abstract
This paper describes a complete event/time
ordering system that annotates raw text with
events, times, and the ordering relations be-
tween them at the SemEval-2013 Task 1. Task
1 is a unique challenge because it starts from
raw text, rather than pre-annotated text with
known events and times. A working system
first identifies events and times, then identifies
which events and times should be ordered, and
finally labels the ordering relation between
them. We present a split classifier approach
that breaks the ordering tasks into smaller de-
cision points. Experiments show that more
specialized classifiers perform better than few
joint classifiers. The NavyTime system ranked
second both overall and in most subtasks like
event extraction and relation labeling.
1 Introduction
The SemEval-2013 Task 1 (TempEval-3) contest is
the third instantiation of an event ordering challenge.
However, it is the first to start from raw text with
the challenge to create an end-to-end algorithm for
event ordering. Previous challenges included the in-
dividual aspects of such a system, including event
extraction, timex extraction, and event/time ordering
(Verhagen et al, 2007; Verhagen et al, 2010). How-
ever, neither task was dependent on the other. This
paper presents NavyTime, a system inspired partly
by this previous breakup of the tasks. We focus on
breaking up the event/time ordering task further, and
show that 5 classifiers yield better performance than
the traditional 3 (or even 1).
The first required steps to annotate a document are
to extract its events and time expressions. This pa-
per describes a new event extractor with a rich set of
contextual features that is a top performer for event
attributes at Tempeval-3. We then explore additions
to SUTime, a top rule-based extractor for time ex-
pressions (Chang and Manning, 2012). However,
the core challenge is to link these extracted events
and times together. We describe new models for
these difficult tasks: (1) identifying ordered pairs,
and (2) labeling the ordering relations.
Relation identification is rarely addressed in the
literature. Given a set of events, which pairs of
events are temporally related? Almost all previous
work assumes we are given the pairs, and the task
is to label the relation (before, after, etc.). Raw
text presents a new challenge: extract the relevant
pairs before labeling them. We present some of the
first results that compare rule-based approaches to
trained probabilistic classifiers. These are the first
such comparisons to our knowledge.
Finally, after relation identification, we label re-
lations between the pairs. This is the traditional
event ordering task, although we now start from
noisy pairs. Our main contribution is to build in-
dependent classifiers for intra-sentence event/time
pairs. We show improved performance when train-
ing these split classifiers. NavyTime?s approach is
highly competitive, achieving 2nd place in relation
labeling (and overall).
2 Dataset
All models are developed on the TimeBank (Puste-
jovsky et al, 2003) and AQUAINT corpora (Mani
73
et al, 2007). These labeled newspaper articles have
fueled many years of event ordering research. Time-
Bank includes 183 documents and AQUAINT in-
cludes 73. The annotators of each were given dif-
ferent guidance, so they provide unique distributions
of relations. Development of the algorithms in this
paper were solely on 10-fold cross validation on the
union of the two corpora.
The SemEval-2013 Task 1 (TempEval-3) provides
unseen raw text to then evaluate the final systems.
Final results are from this set of unseen newspaper
articles. They were annotated by a different set of
people who annotated TimeBank and AQUAINT.
3 Event Extraction
The first stage to processing raw text is to extract
the event mentions. We treat this as a binary classi-
fication task, classifying each token as either event
or not-event. Events are always single tokens in the
TimeBank/AQUAINT corpora, so a document with
n tokens requires n classifications. Further, each
event is marked up with its tense, aspect, and class.
We used a maximum entropy classification
framework based on the lexical and syntactic con-
text of the target word. The same features are used
to first identify events (binary decision), and then
three classifiers are trained for the tense, aspect, and
class. The following features were used:
Token N-grams: Standard n-gram context that
includes the target token (1,2,3grams), as well as
the unigrams and bigrams that occur directly before
and after the target token.
Part of Speech n-grams: The POS tag of the target,
and the bigram and trigram ending with the target.
Lemma: The lemmatized token in WordNet.
WordNet-Event: A binary feature, true if the token
is a descendent of the Event synset in WordNet.
Parse Path: The tree path from the token?s leaf
node to the root of the syntactic parse tree.
Typed Dependencies: The typed dependency triple
of any edge that begins or ends with the target.
We used 10-fold cross validation on the combined
corpora of TimeBank and AQUAINT to develop the
above features, and then trained one classifier on the
entire dataset. Our approach was the 2nd best event
extraction system out of 8 submission sites on the
unseen test set from TempEval-3. Detailed results
are given in Figure 1.
Results on event attribute extraction were also
good (Figure 1). We again ranked 2nd best in both
Tense and Aspect. Only with the Class attribute did
we fare worse (4th of 8). We look forward to com-
paring approaches to see why this particular attribute
was not as successful.
4 Temporal Expression Extraction
As with event extraction, time expressions need to
be identified from the raw text. Recent work on time
extraction has suggested that rule-based approaches
outperform others (Chang and Manning, 2012), so
we adopted the proven SUTime system for this task.
SUTime is a rule-based system that extracts phrases
and normalizes them to a TimeML time. However,
we improved it with some TimeBank specific rules.
We observed that the phrases ?a year ago? and ?the
latest quarter? were often inconsistent with standard
TimeBank annotations. These tend to involve fiscal
quarters, largely due to TimeBank?s heavy weight on
the financial genre. For these phrases, we first deter-
mine the current fiscal quarter, and adjust the nor-
malized time to include the quarter, not just the year
(e.g., 2nd quarter of 2012, rather than just 2012).
Further, the generic phrase ?last year? should nor-
malize to just a year, and not include a more specific
month or quarter. We added rules to strip off months.
SUTime was the best system for time extraction,
and our usage matched its performance as one would
hope. Full credit goes to SUTime, and its extraction
is not a contribution of this paper. However, Navy-
Time outperformed SUTime by over 3.5 F1 points
on time normalization. Our additional rulebank ap-
pears to have helped significantly, allowing Navy-
Time to be the 2nd best in this category behind Hei-
delTime. We recommend users to use either Heidel-
Time or SUTime with the NavyTime rulebank.
5 Temporal Relation Extraction
After events and time expressions are identified, it
remains to create temporal links between them. A
temporal link is an ordering relation that occurs in
four possible entity pairings: event-event, event-
time, time-time, and event-DCT (DCT is the doc-
ument creation time).

It is unrealistic to label all possible pairs in a doc-
ument. Many event/time pairs have ambiguous or-
derings, and others are simply not labeled by the an-
notators. We propose a two-stage approach where
we first identify likely pairs (relation identification),
and then independently decide what specific order-
ing relation holds between them (relation labeling).
5.1 Relation Identification
TempEval-3 defined the set of possible relations to
exist in particular configurations: (1) any pairs in
the same sentence, (2) event-event pairs of main
events in adjacent sentences, and (3) event-DCT
pairs. However, the training and test corpora do not
follow these rules. Many pairs are skipped to save
human effort. This task is thus a difficult balance be-
tween labeling all true relations, but also matching
the human annotators. We tried two approaches to
identifying pairs: rule-based, and data-driven learn-
ing.
Rule-Based: We extract all event-event and event-
time pairs in the same sentence if they are adjacent
to each other (no intervening events or times). We
also extract main event pairs of adjacent sentences.
We identify main events by finding the highest VP
in the parse tree.
Data-Driven: This approach treats it as a bi-
nary classification task. Given a pair of enti-
ties, determine if they are ordered or not-ordered.
We condense the training corpora?s TLINK rela-
tions into ordered, and label all non-labeled pairs
as not-ordered. We tried a variety of classifiers
for each event/time pair type: (1) intra-sentence
event-event, (2) intra-sentence event-time, (3) inter-

sentence event-event, and (4) event-DCT.
The data-driven features are shown in Figure 2.
After labeling pairs of entities, the ordered pairs are
then labeled with specific relations, described next.
5.2 Relation Labeling
This is the traditional ordering task. Given a set
of entity pairs, label each with a temporal relation.
TempEval-3 uses the full set of 12 relations.
Traditionally, ordering research trains a single
classifier for all event-event links, and a second for
all event-time links. We experimented with more

specific classifiers, observing that two events in the
same sentence share a syntactic context that does not
exist between two events in different sentences. We
must instead rely on discourse cues and word seman-
tics for the latter. We thus propose using different
classifiers to learn better feature weights for these
unique contexts. Splitting into separate classifiers is
largely unexplored on TimeBank, and just recently
applied to a medical domain (Xu et al, 2013).
We train two MaxEnt classifiers for event-event
links (inter and intra-sentence), and two for event-
time links. The event-DCT links also have their own
classifier for a total of 5 classifiers. We use the same
features (Figure 2) as in relation identification.
5.3 Experiments and Results
All models were created by using 10-fold cross val-
idation on TimeBank+AQUAINT. The best model
was then trained on the entire set. Features seen
only once were trimmed from training. The relation
labeling confidence threshold was set to 0.3. Final
results are reported on the held out test set provided
by SemEval-2013 Task 1 (TempEval-3).
Our first experiments focus on relation labeling.
This is a simpler task than identification in that we
start with known pairs of entities, and the task is to
assign a label to them (Task C-relation at SemEval-
2013 Task 1). Table 1 gives the results. Our system
initially ranked second with 46.83.
The next task is both relation identification and
relation labeling combined (Task C). This is unfor-
tunately a task that is difficult to define. Without a
completely labeled graph of events and times, it is
not about true extraction, but matching human la-
beling decisions that were constrained by time and
effort. We experimented with rule-based vs data-
driven extractors. We held our relation labeling
model constant, and swapped different identification
models in and out. Our best configuration was eval-
uated on test. Results are shown in Table 2. Navy-
Time is the third best performer.
Finally, the full task from raw text requires all

stages of this paper, starting from event and tem-
poral extraction, then applying relation ID and la-
beling. Results are shown in Table 3. Our system
ranked 2nd of 4 systems.
Our best performing setup uses trained classi-
fiers for relation identification of event-event and
event-DCT links, but deterministic rules for event-
time links (Sec 5.1). It then uses trained classi-
fiers for relation labeling of all pair types. Train-
ing with TimeBank+AQUAINT outperformed just
TimeBank. The split classifier approach for intra
and inter-sentence event-event relations also outper-
formed a single event-event classifier. We cannot
give more specific results due to space constraints.
6 Discussion
Our system was 2nd in most of the subtasks and
overall (Task ABC). Split-classifiers for inter and
intra-sentence pairs are beneficial. Syntactic fea-
tures help event extraction. Compared to cleartk,
NavyTime was better in event and time extraction
individually, but worse overall. Our approach to re-
lation identification is likely the culprit.
We urge future work to focus on relation identifi-
cation. Event and time performance is high, and re-
lation labeling is covered in the literature. For iden-
tification, it is not clear that TimeBank-style corpora
are appropriate for evaluation. Human annotators do
not create connected graphs. How can we evaluate
systems that do? Do we want systems that mimic
imperfect, but testable human effort? Accurate eval-
uation on raw text requires fully labeled test sets.
