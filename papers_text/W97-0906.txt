Abstract 
The paper describes the experiences of a 
multi-national consortium in an on-going 
project o construct a multilingual uthoring 
tool for business letters. The consortium 
consists of two universities (both with 
significant experience in language 
engineering), three software companies, and 
various potential commercial users with the 
organisations being located in a total of four 
countries. The paper covers the history of 
the development of the project from an 
academic idea but focuses on the 
implications of the user-requirements 
orientated outlook of the commercial 
developers and the implications of this view 
for the system architecture, user 
requirements, delivery platforms and so on. 
Particularly interesting consequences of the 
user requirements are the database centred 
architecture, and the constraints and 
opportunities this presents for development 
of grammatical components at both the text 
and sentence l vel. 
I. Introduction 
This paper describes our experience in working on 
the European Union (EU) Framework IV Language 
Engineering project, MABLe (Multi-lingual 
Authoring of Business letters). One of the aims of 
the Language Engineering sector of the programme 
is to develop applications which help improve 
information access and interchange across 
languages (Telematics, 1996), within the broader 
objective of assisting Small and Medium sized 
Enterprises (SMEs). 
Framework IV projects are expected to form the 
basis of systems put into practical use in the 
medium term, and the focus of the paper is the 
practical and technical problems faced by the 
consortium in moving the fruits of academic 
research towards a widely used practical product.

The MABLe project is being undertaken by a 
consortium consisting of: 
MARI Computer Systems Ltd. (UK) 
Industrial Developer 
SENA S.A. (Greece) 
- Industrial Developer 
STI S.A. (Spain) 
- Industrial Developer 
Pan Hellenic Exporters Assoc. (Greece) 
- Industrial User Association 
Centro de Sondi E Imagen S.L. (Spain) 
- Lead Industrial User 
University of Sunderland (UK) 
- Academic Research 
University of Heidelberg (Germany) 
- Academic Research 
The project targets SMEs who conduct 
international trade as the main potential users of the 
system. Its goal is to build a system which will help 
people who wish to write a good quality business 
letter in a language with which they are not fluent; 
via an interaction with the computer conducted in 
their native language. The current project will build 
a prototype allowing Greek and Spanish users to 
produce letters in English. However, the system has 
been designed to allow relatively straightforward 
extension to other languages, both by making the 
user interface localizable, and (less 
straightforwardly) by storing knowledge of the 
output language in a language independent 
grarnnmtieal database. 
An initial, limited, prototype of the system is now 
available and work has started on a second 
prototype with more extensive functionality. This is 
due for delivery for user evaluation i  mid 1997. 
The academic partners initially sawthe project as 
an opportunity to move their existing knowledge 
and, more particularly, linguistic resources into 
practical use, the major challenges being in 
computational inguistics. In practice the 
commercial partners have identified many problems 
of a less intellectual nature which must be 
overcome if the system produced is both to be 
accepted by users and to operate within their 
environment. This paper will concentrate on these 
practical issues and hopefully provide a useful 
basis for those undertaking applications orientated 
research which they hope to move into practieal use 
in the medium term. 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2 reviews the development of the project 
from its conception following a series of 
conversations between academics. Section 3 moves 
on to describe the way the initial project was 
reformulated to become user-requirements 
orientated rather than technology driven, once we 
began to work with our industrial partners. Section 
4 describes the architecture of the system as we are 
now constructing it and Section 5 covers some of 
the User Interface issues the MABLe project and its 
architecture have thrown up. Section 6 covers the 
issue of delivery platform which was of great 
importance to the commercial partners and, once 
selected, drove us towards the architecture 
described in Section 4, while Section 7 briefly 
reviews ome of the consequences of this approach 
for the development and representation of the 
grammatical formalisms. Section 8 moves on to 
cover the issues of facilitating the ultimate 
exploitation of the software. Section 9 draws some 
conclusions from our work to date. 
2.  H is tory  
The MABLe project arose from a series of 
conversations between John Tait of the University 
of Sunderland and Peter Hellwig and Heinz-Detlev 
36 
Koch of the University of Heidelberg during 1994 
and 1995. At that time the concept was very much 
an interaetively controlled natural language 
generator utilising Heidelberg's Dependency 
Unification Grammar resources (Hellwig, 1986, 
1993) combined with a newly developed text 
grammar for business letters. During 1995 
interested commercial partners and potential users 
were identified, leading to the successful 
submission of an EU Framework IV Language 
Engineering proposal. 
The aim, from the academic's point of view, was 
always to try to constrain the problem so that 
existing, well-developed, even old-fashioned, 
computational linguistic technology would suffice. 
Our intention was to explore the limits, in a 
practical setting, of what the technology could do. 
Our main concerns were issues like whether a user 
interface could be built which was not excessively 
cumbersome, and whether sufficient coverage could 
be produced within a reasonable amount of time 
and effort, given available human and linguistic 
resources. 
Once the project was started, in late 1995, it 
become clear that there were a number of other 
issues of great concern to our users and commercial 
partners which we had not considered previously. 
Foremost amongst these was the need to integrate 
MABLe with the users' existing and likely future 
working environment, a requirement which created 
several low and high level technical problems. 
3. User motivation 
The MABLe project as it is currently formulated 
has as its core the belief that language technology 
now exists which can satisfy real user needs and 
requirements. Writing letters in a foreign language 
is one of the most common problems faced by 
organisations engaging in international trade. This 
is especially true for SMEs who are unlikely to 
have specialist translation teams or expensive 
multilingual staff. Before the project started in 
earnest, he MABLe partners carried out a survey 
to identify the problems potential users encountered 
when writing letters in foreign languages. This 
survey was continued uring the early stages of the 
project in order to create a set of user recquirements 
to serve as a basis for the MABLe system 
specification and design. The results of the survey 
showed the need for an application which provided: 
? Compatibility with all commonly used word- 
processors 
? Friendly and self-contained user interface 
? Access to user databases (with client data, 
product data etc.) 
? A set of common 'template' letters 
? A good thesaurus of phrases 
? Textual cohesion and good linkage between 
phrases. 
? Search by expressions and keywords 
? A good electronic dictionary 
The application should run under MS-Windows 
and have an affordable price, not higher than 200 
ECU. 
MABLe is being developed with all these user 
requirements in mind, and in order to make user- 
requirements elicitation a dynamic process, user 
groups have been created in Spain and Greece to 
review MABLe progress and provide development 
feedback. The Spanish group is composed of 
organisations from different market sectors in 
which foreign business letters writing is an 
important task. This group will, consequently, also 
play an important role in the market analysis tasks 
to be carried out within the project, providing 
information on market expectations, target users' 
willingness, barriers to market entry, and potential 
competitors. The Greek user group is composed of 
import & export organisations.

Communication between these components is 
outlined in Figure 1. (The view of the architecture 
provided by Figure 1 is somewhat simplified, 
omitting for example, morphological processing) 
Perhaps one of the most noteworthy features of our 
architecture is the central role accorded to the 
database. Our reasons for adopting this 
architecture are discussed in Section 6. 
We are considering a number of changes and 
extensions to this model: for example the 
substitution of MS Word output by other formats, 
but these matters of detail are not really the concern 
of this paper. 
4. MABLe Architecture 
Following our initial analysis of user requirements 
we arrived at a system architecture consisting of 
seven main components: 
l) 
2) 
3) 
4) 
5) 
a text grammar of English for business 
letters 
a multilingual phrasal lexicon 
a fragmentary grammar of Engli.sh for 
variable portions within phrases 
a database in which both static data 
(multilingual phrasal lexicons, grammars 
etc.) and intermediate r sults of processing 
are stored 
a tree walk and generate programme which 
walks over the tree represented bythe 
grammar, making decisions in consultation 
with the user about which path to follow 
through the grammar 
5. MABLe  User Interface 
User Interface design, in language engineering 
especially, is often thought to be about the 
superficial ergonomic aspects of button and 
window layout on the users screen. Of course, 
getting this right is essential to a users basic ability 
to read and interpret the screen correctly. However, 
sophisticated products need to consider the nature 
of the user interaction required, and how this may 
be provided to the user in a controlled and 
controllable manner. 
MABLe presents ome unique opportunities in this 
area, since it is understood that the program is 
designed for users who know that their knowledge 
of a foreign language is less than perfect. They do 
not need reminding of this constantly, rather, they 
need guidance and support whilst being made to 
feel it is they that are in control of the program, and 
not vice versa. 
38 
At the same time, MABLe needs to fit tidily into the 
user's work routine, or it will not be accepted. 
These requirements have lead us to design several 
user interfaces with different philosophies. 
The first interface is based on the well known 
"Wizard" interaction style found on PCs. Here a 
user is guided through an interaction, and the 
program selects the best options based on user 
input. For MABLe this implies following a rigid 
tree walk of the letter grammar to produce 
grammatical output. Although the user may track 
both his input and the target language output, there 
is a rigid feel to the program, with the user feeling 
out of control. Thus, even though this interface is 
integrated with Microsoft Word it has not found 
instant popularity with the users in the second 
phase of our user requirements work. 
Our second interface is based on representing the 
grammar as a clickable tree in a standalone 
application. This has the advantage of the full 
screen area being exploited with users choosing 
phrases as they like. Output is subsequently 
exported to a Word Processor. 
Here one may choose phrases at will, and not 
necessarily following a coherent form. However, 
one could say from work in text, planning and 
Rhetorical Structure Theory (de Beaugrande and 
Dressier, 1981, Appelt, 1985, Mann and 
Thompson, 1987) that discourse coherence is 
enforced by the user, and is language independent, 
so that in practice this matters little. 
Clearly we are currently looking at merging both 
approaches. That is, we need to advise the user of 
grammatical or foreign language conventions that 
we may derive from our letter grammar, whilst 
leaving him free to make errors if he wishes. 
As we have seen, MABLe's letter grammar gives 
users the possibility of creating coherent business 
letters. It is the task of the User Interface designer 
to ensure that the user takes advantage of these 
possibilities. 
6. Delivery Vehicles 
As noted earlier, the initial targets of MABLe are 
those Small-to-Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) 
undertaking international trade. Our initial user 
survey work indicated that for delivery and 
evaluation on Spanish and Greek user sites within 
the time frame of the project (i.e. for a December 
1998 completion) earlier versions of the MABLe 
system would need to integrate with Microsoft 
Word 6.0 running under Windows 3.1. This 
combination was still likely to be the predominant 
operating environment a  user sites and user PCs 
with more than 8 or 12 Mbytes of RAM would be 
unusual. In fact when the user survey was 
undertaken the majority of Greek sites were still 
operating with DOS and WordPerfect and the like, 
though they expected to change shortly. Although 
Microsoft would lead developers to expect 
predominance of Windows '95 and Word 7.0 (or 
even Windows NT) at much earlier dates, to rely on 
this occuring in our target market seemed to 
produce significant additional commercial and 
technical risks for the project. 
From the NLE point of view this decision has 
profound implications. Most research 
computational linguistic systems are built to run on 
UNIX workstations with very large virtual address 
spaces, supported by 64Mbytes or more of real 
RAM. Windows 3.1 is a 16 bit operating system, 
implying a much smaller address space, and 
although 32 bit programming is possible it is by no 
means completely reliable and satisfactory. 
Typically the products of computational linguistic 
research require large amounts of RAM, tending to 
operate with their grammars and even their 
dictionaries as in-store data structures. Taking into 
account the restrictions on address pace and RAM, 
39 
along with the need to build a well engineered 
system which could be easily modernised, we chose 
to store our grammar, lexicon (mainly phrasal) and 
intermediate r sults in a relational database on disc. 
Having adopted a database-central architecture 
with comparatively modest demands on virtual 
memory and real RAM, we can easily move the 
system on to more modem systems with fewer 
restrictions. Specifically, systems with flail 32-bit 
addressing support (like Windows 95 or Windows 
NT). 
Early technical feasibility work has led us to adopt 
the MS Access database, because of its wide 
adoption in the commercial marketplace and the 
comparative ease with which it may be integrated 
with other Microsoft products. However, MABLe 
could easily be adapted to work with most common 
alternative r lational database systems. 
incremental search of the type offered in standard 
'help' systems i  made available to the user 
The hierarchy and internal structure of the business 
letters is represented by a grammar with a context 
free phrase structure skeleton. However, in order 
to enforce consistency of registzr, lcxical cohosion 
and subject matter, a set of attributes of varying 
complexity can be associated with relevant 
constituents. 
The formalism is described as an SGML Document 
Type Definition (DTD) both to facilitate eventual 
re-use of linguistic resources and to define and 
constrain the power of the grammar precisely. 
UNIX tools have been created to allow automatic 
conversion from the SGML format to an agreed 
Access database format accessible to the Tree 
Walking algorithm that creates the final letter in 
conjunction with the user. 
7. Grammatical Representation 
It is important that the user be able to find the letter 
or letter fragment they require, and this 'navigation 
issue" has implications for the design of the 
grammar. There are many ways to sort types of 
letter: by general subject, e.g. 'complaints', or by 
transaction grouping, e.g. all those letters involved 
in the process of buying goods. 
The overlapping of such sets of letters calls for 
internal representation as a directed graph rather 
than a tree, a design which is also appropriate for 
the internal structure of letters, allowing re-use of 
commonly recurring sub-structures such as 
formulaic openings etc. 
Similarly, a 'direct-search' approach to reaching a
desired letter/letter-fragment imposes a need for 
systematic naming of non-terminals, especially if 
Additionally, a database browsing program has 
been written to allow convenient construction of the 
grammar via Access. For the linguist constructing a 
large grammar, this browser allows tree structure to 
be easily viewed and modified. Furthermore, it is 
envisaged that end users may wish to make simple 
additions and changes to the letter grammar, and a 
method more portable and user friendly than 
SGML editing was required. Envisaged 
customisation f the grammar includes the addition 
of new slot-fillers (products, companies, etc.) and 
the addition of simple letter templates. Database 
integrity is vital, so in order to ensure grammar 
extensions introduced with the browser follow the 
given formalism, a set of database queries are 
employed to regulate the Access tables. 
It is hoped the approach adopted will support he 
required level of textual cohesion, but it would be 
premature toconclude that it does at this stage. 
8. Exploitability 
40 
Commercial exploitation is the main aim of the 
MABLe consortium. In addition to the creation of 
the MABLe user groups, which complement the 
work of the user partners in ensuring that product 
development follows the evolution of user needs 
and expectations, MABLe is undertaking a series of 
dissemination activities to ensure that the project is 
internationally promoted. These include production 
of leaflets, organisation of conferences, and 
publications. 
Commercial success hinges on the elaboration of a 
good exploitation plan. This entails tarting with a 
suitable product definition, continuously monitoring 
competition and analysing the benefits and risks 
inherent to the potential market. MABLe has a 
clearly defined target market: writers of foreign 
business letters with some knowledge of the target 
language, but who are not sufficiently fluent to 
produce output of the necessary quality. 
The essential requirements of these writers appear 
to be clear and the consortium is progressing with 
the development to satisfy these under the 
understanding that MABLe will be an attractive 
product which will: 
? help organisations (in particular SMEs) to 
overcome language problems 
? enable the creation of high quality unambiguous 
business letters 
? provide consistent letter authoring standards 
? provide stylistic suitability of content' 
With these characteristics it is thought that MABLe 
will help to improve productivity, reduce overheads 
by eliminating unnecessary waste of time and 
resources, and, consequently, bea useful tool which 
organisations will be prepared to buy. 
The consortium is aware of the risks inherent to 
such a development: the need to match development 
time and market maturity, choose the right 
technologies and platforms, and to control costs and 
obtain scale economies. With the ability to control 
these risks, the development driven by the user 
requirements to ensure position as high 
performance, high value, and long lead time 
product, and the appropriate market'mg and 
promotion activities, the consortium is confident of 
reaching the target market in a short time after the 
project concludes. 
9. Conclusions 
Even at this comparatively early stage in the project 
there are two initial conclusions which may be 
drawn. 
First it is has been difficult to re-use existing 
linguistic resources. The demand for different 
delivery platforms, the constraints of a new task 
and so on have driven us to primarily re-use our 
language ngineering knowledge, rather than re-use 
existing resources and software, although it is 
hoped that indirect re-use of existing resources in 
radically re-processed forms may be possible in 
later parts of the project. 
The second conclusion is that issues like real user 
requirements, in terms of interfaces, delivery 
platforms and so on are perhaps too little 
considered on many Language Engineering 
projects.
