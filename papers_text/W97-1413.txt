1. Introduction 
In the domain of natural language 
understanding and more precisely man- 
machine dialogue design, there are usually 
two trends of research which seem to be 
rather differentiated. On the one hand, many 
studies have tackled the problem of 
interpreting spatial references expressed in 
verbal utterances, focusing in particular on the 
different geometric or functionnal constraints 
which are bound to the existance of a "source" 
(or site) element in relation to which a 
'target" is being situated. Such studies are 
usually based upon fine grained linguistic 
descriptions for different languages 
(Vandeloise, 1986). On the other hand, the 
problem raised by the integration of a 
gestural mode within classical NL interfaces 
has yielded some specific research about the 
association of demonstrative or deictic Nps 
together with designations, as initited by 
Bolt some two decades ago (cf. Thorisson et 
alii, 1992; Bellalem and Romary, 1995). Our 
aim in this paper is to show that the 
different phenomena described in the context 
of spatial reference or multimodal interaction 
should not necessarily be considered as two 
independant issues, but should rather be 
analysed in a unified way to account for the 
fact that they are both based on linguistic and 
perceptual data. 
As a matter of fact, if we consider a situation 
of man-machine dialogue where the user is 
presented with a graphical representation of
his task, it is clear that, given a certain 
informational content he wants to convey, h e 
will essentially choose a referring mode 
which seems most relevant in the current 
communicative situation. For example, if we 
consider a graphical situation such as that  
described in figure 1.1, he may either use the 
black triangle, this triangle (+ pointing 
gesture), the leftmost triangle to refer to the 
left most object, and it would be quite annoying 
to consider these different expressions as 
corresponding to uncomparable referring 
modes 1.

Figure 1.1 
In this context, we will try to show how 
language, gesture and perception can be seen in 
a uniform way from the perspective of 
referential analysis, even if doing so we wi l l  
have to look at the specific constraints which 
underly the speaker's choice of a given 
expression. To this end, we will first quickly 
situate the relative importance of speech and 
gesture in man-machine communication. Then, 
we will concentrate upc~ the specific effects 
resulting from the combination of verbal, 
gestural and perceptual information, showing 
that on the one hand the three provide 
structural constraints to the objects which are 
being referred to and on the other hand that  
any referring operation, whatever its origin, 
has to be interpreted within a localized 
frame, with some consequences upon dialogue 
management. 
2. Several means to make a referring 
act 
When designating a given object within a 
visual environment, it seem at first sight 
that Natural Language provides 
uncomparable means to do so as opposed to 
gesture. Beyond the different determiners 
which are present in most natural languages 
either explicitely or implicitely (indefinite, 
definite or demonstrative), nominal 
categories allows one to set the proper level of 
granularity corresponding to the intended 
object. Indeed, in a situation where a gesture 
would be ambiguous and point to the overall  
scene (a set of geometrical shapes), a specific 
i In particular, gricean maxims as well as relevance 
theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1986) would tend 
towards an analysis which compare the different 
referring expressions interms of cognitive cost.

object (a triangle) or any of its part (a 
segment, a point etc.), the sole phrase the 
triangle may directly designate what is being 
intended. 
Another important aspect is that pointing 
gestures 2, when used in the general framework 
of an oral dialogue, can seldom appear in 
isolation, wheras a definite description such 
as the blue triangle can clearly be expressed 
independantly of any gesture. The reason for 
this is, as we said, that the intrisic ambiguity 
of gesture implies that it should be 
complemented with a categorizing expression, 
but also because a gesture cannot express very 
easily an action to be performed upon the 
by means of formulae (at step b) such as: 
* triangle(R) & (card(R) >= 2) & R included 
R' & R at the left as compared to (R'- R) 
in what concerns 2.1.a and 
e triangleR) & (card(R) >= 2) & (made 
sallient (by gesture) R) in what concerns 
2.2.a. 
Although these two referential expressions, if 
ever used, are unambiguous, we would 
certainly prefer such examples as: 
Figure 2.1.b: the leflmost triangles 
and 
? designated _,object and has thus to be also 
complemented by a predicative utterance. In 
? this latter case, it is hard to imagine that any 
combination will be possible between 
linguistic chunks and gestural acts. In 
particular, gesture can hardly fill a role 
which is mandatory for a given predicate, 
since it would lead to odd utterances uch as 
?give me the color of \[pointing\]. 
3. Reference and contrast 
The schematic algorithm used in most 
dialogue systems in order to deal with 
referential NPs (in the case they get their 
reference within a context which is visual ly 
presented) can be expressed as: 
a) get al the indices from the expression; 
b) deduce from these indices some constraints 
which must be true in the visual 
representation; 
c) filter the referent(s) thanks to these 
constraints. 
In such a framework, what would be expected 
as the system's perceptuel abilities boils 
down to an ability to build the set of objects 
appearing on the screen. Such an approach 
would compute the "correct" referents in such 
examples as: 
Figure 2.1.a: the leflmost triangles 
or  
Figure 2.2.a: these triangles 
2 We do not consider here other types of gestures, 
either ergative, epistemic or mimetic as described in 
(Cadoz, 1992). 
Figure 2.2.b: these triangles 
What seems to lack in examples 2.1.a and 
2.2.a is a visual contrast hat pre-exists to the 
refering expression. The refering expression 
itself is not sufficient to establish such a 
contrast. If the user intends to refer to the first 
two triangles of figure 2.1.a, he would 
probably prefer an expression such as the two 
leftmost triangles or these triangles together 
with a "peripheral" designation as we wil l  
describe it latter. Our claim about the 
necessity of a perceivable discrimination 
seems in accordance with what Robert Dale 
(Reiter and Dale 1992, Dale 1995) observes 
about referential expression generation. Just as 
we do, he argues that the relevance of a 
refering expression does not only rely on its 
ability to filter a unique referent but also cn 
its ability to establish a contrast in a 
contextual set of objects. 
Examples 2.1.b and 2.2.b rely on an already 
accessible discrimination based upon spatial  
cohesion. In such a case, the definite referring 
expression (the leftmo~t triangle) directly 
maps the spatial discrimination. Such 
examples as: 
Figure 2.3.a: the leftmost riangles 
and 
Figure 2.3.b: these triangles 
96 B. Gaiffe and L. Romary 
show that any percepually based 
discrimination (we could as well have a 
contrast in size, texture or whatsoever) is 
sufficient to justify the leftmost triangles 
(these triangles + gesture respectively) 3. 
If a dialogue system has to understand such 
expressions as those we mentioned so far, h e 
therefore should perceive its environment on a 
more "user compatible" basis. We suggest at 
least that perceptual contrasts should be 
taken into account in order to structure the set 
of visible objects. 
When no contrast pre-exists which would 
directly support an intended reference, we 
mentioned the possibility to build a group on 
the basis of individuals by such an explicit 
expression as "the two leftmost riangles". A 
corresponding solution in terms of 
demonstrative use would be something l ike 
this triangle and this one (or these two 
triangles) together with two pointing 
gestures. Another solution consists in building 
the contrast by means of a "peripheral 
designation" which justifies our claim about 
considering perception and designation on a 
unified constrastive basis. In order to argue 
that claim, we will now re-consider gestures 
almost independantly from the referential 
expressions they accompany. 
4. Gesture and contrast 
Our analysis of demonstrative and definite 
NPs (when referring within a perceptual 
environment) relies on perceptually founded 
contrasts. The required precision of a 
designation gesture therefore depends upon 
these perceptive constrasts. In such an 
example as: 
relies on the same kind of horizontal 
discrimination: 
the only difference with the preceeding 
example is that we refer to a cohesive group. 
The horizontal discrimination identifies here 
two groups from which gesture only has to 
select one. However, such situations as: 
do not provide any perceptual grouping of 
something which would correspond to "the 
upper and the righmost riangles in the left 
group of three". If the user intends to refer to 
these two triangles, he has to build a 
discrimination into the group. A possible 
gesture to do that is depicted bellow: 
Such "peripheral" designations take up for 
the absence of a shared perceptual feature 
(such colour), as it both gather up the two 
objects and put them into focus. The analysis 
of the whole intervention (the gesture plus 
the NP "these triangles") is then of the same 
kind as its equivalent in 2.3.b. As such, we 
clearly see here that gesture, instead of just 
being another mtxte of communication, \ [ \ ]  
pertains to the same domain as perceptual 
information. \ [ \ ]  
Our analysis o far can thus be summarized as " 
the gesture only has to separate the two 
triangles along the horizontal, since the 
perceptive contrast relies upon a separation of 
the objec~ on that direction. No strict 
inclusion of the pointing into the left triangle 
is required. The situation depicted below 
3 In some cases, the speaker has the possibility to 
elicit the contrasfive feature. E.g. The l~lack triangles 
(fig.2.3.b) 
follows: 
? a contrast based on the category has to 
match a perceptive contrast in the case of 
simple definite Nps, thus meaning that  
perceivable triangles hould be considered 
when analyzing the triangle(s) 
? a contrast based on saliance has to match a 
perceptive contrast in the case of 
demonstrative Nps. As we only considered 
in this paper demonstrative plus gestures, 
Constraints on the Use of Language, Gesture and Speech .for Multiraodal Dialogues 97 
the required saliance is yielded by gesture 
itself 
? a spatial contrast has to match a 
perceptive contrast (not necesserally 
spatial) in the case of spatial definite 
NPs. 
The remaining problem is now to limit the 
context in which we consider these contrasts. 
There are expressions in dialogue corpora that 
cannot be properly understood if we do not 
take into account focusing phenomena as well 
as attentional contexts and visual 
capabilities. Moreover, as we will justify, in 
such reduced contexts, functionality 
associated to the objects considered may 
introduce specific orientations. 
5. Loca l i z ing  spatial references 
Having shown that any spatial - - in  the 
broad sense we want to advocate - -  reference 
is based upon a structural organisation of a set 
of elements, we will now see how this very set 
plays a real role of contextualizing the 
referring process, with some consequences upon 
dialogue management. Indeed, all our 
examples o far were simple enough to imply 
that there was only one context in which to 
find the intended referent. On the contrary, i f 
we consider a more complex situation taken 
from a Wizard of Oz simulation in the domain 
of interior furnishing (Dauchy et ali, 1993; 
Mignot et ali 1993), we will see that our 
analysis should actually be drawn a step 
further. Figure 4.1 examplifies a typical 
situation that was presented to the user 
during the experiment, with an empty 
drawing room to be furnished using the 
presented elements. 
speaker and the hearer for a spatial reference 
to be understood, we can quickly see that this 
structure can only be inferred within a 
localized context which first limits its 
extension, but also subsumes its general 
characteristics uch as the categories of 
objects, their perceptual or functional 
properties etc. Paradoxically, we could say 
that it is difficult to contrast objects having 
little or nothing in common as there would be 
no reason for a speaker to compare them in any 
way. Besides, such contexts eem to have a 
certain amount of stability during a dialogue, 
as can be seen in the following example 
associated with figure 4.2: 
U1 : turn the sofa round 
U2 : move up a bit the armchair on the right 
I1. , f '  
Figure 4.2: Referential contextualisation. 
Figure 4.1 : Initial scene for the interior 
furnishing scenario. 
Following the observation that there should 
be a prior structure shared by both the 
Here, it appears that the spatial reference in 
the second utterance is not computed globally 
on the visualized scene but upon a sub-space 
resulting from the interpretation of the first 
utterance and thus centered on the sofa. Such a 
sub-space is characterized by its spatial  
inclusion within that of the drawing room, hut 
also by the different characteristics 
(especially functionnal ones) of the objects i t 
contains. 
At this stage we can thus caracterize a 
spatial referring operation as a double system 
of vertical and horizontal relationships 
within a context which encompasses the object 
which is being referred to, but also the set of 
alternatives which being stated either 
explicitaly or implicitaly during the current

4.3 summarizes these different constraints for 
a reference to object O1 within a context C, the 
alternatives being reduced here to a single 
object 02.

Figure 4.3: localizing links 
In this schema, f is the functionnal link (FL) 
which unites the different objects to their 
current contexP, and.which has to be shared 
by the whole set of alternatives. R is the 
contrasting relation which allows the 
interpreter to isolate the referent of the 
expression from the other members of the set 
of alternatives. The very existance of both C 
and f are supposed to be implied by the nature 
of the referring expression. Similarly, the 
relation R is constrained by the type of the 
expression and can be further specified as 
follows: 
? definite description (the triangle): 
Cat(O1) ~ Cat(O2) (intercategorial 
contrast) 
? demonstrative NP (this triangle): Cat(O1) 
= Cat(O2) (intra-categorial contrast) 
? spatial definite description: Pos(O1) n 
Pos(O2) = O (localization contrast) 
In this last case, the referential expression is 
usually explicit (e.g. the leftmost armchair) 
about the actual contrasting relation and thus 
makes the presence of alternatives all the 
more obvious. For the two other cases, it is 
usually through the following utterances 
that, as we have seen, we can justify the 
presence of the set of alternatives. As a 
matter of fact, one consequence of constraining 
a referential operation to a localized frame is 
that these have a certain amount of stabi l i ty 
from utterance to utterance. 
6. Conc lus ions  
In this paper, we argue on the one hand for a 
unified account of gesture and perception, and 
on the other hand for a matching between 
contrastive conditions required by referential

expressions and a pre-existing perceptual 
contrast. We show that such a contrast has to 
be localized and to exhibit traces of these 
contexts through dialogue structures as well as 
specific orientation properties related to such 
perceptual contexts.
