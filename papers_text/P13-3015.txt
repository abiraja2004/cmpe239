Abstract
Identifying complex words (CWs) is an
important, yet often overlooked, task
within lexical simplification (The process
of automatically replacing CWs with sim-
pler alternatives). If too many words are
identified then substitutions may be made
erroneously, leading to a loss of mean-
ing. If too few words are identified then
those which impede a user?s understand-
ing may be missed, resulting in a com-
plex final text. This paper addresses the
task of evaluating different methods for
CW identification. A corpus of sentences
with annotated CWs is mined from Sim-
ple Wikipedia edit histories, which is then
used as the basis for several experiments.
Firstly, the corpus design is explained and
the results of the validation experiments
using human judges are reported. Exper-
iments are carried out into the CW identi-
fication techniques of: simplifying every-
thing, frequency thresholding and training
a support vector machine. These are based
upon previous approaches to the task and
show that thresholding does not perform
significantly differently to the more na??ve
technique of simplifying everything. The
support vector machine achieves a slight
increase in precision over the other two
methods, but at the cost of a dramatic trade
off in recall.
1 Introduction
Complex Word (CW) identification is an impor-
tant task at the first stage of lexical simplification
and errors introduced or avoided here will affect
final results. This work looks at the process of au-
tomatically identifying difficult words for a lexi-
cal simplification system. Lexical simplification
is the task of identifying and replacing CWs in a
text to improve the overall understandability and
readability. This is a difficult task which is com-
putationally expensive and often inadequately ac-
curate.
Lexical simplification is just one method of
text simplification and is often deployed alongside
other simplification methods (Carrol et al, 1998;
Alu??sio and Gasperin, 2010). Syntactic simplifi-
cation, statistical machine translation and seman-
tic simplification (or explanation generation) are
all current methods of text simplification. Text
simplification is typically deployed as an assistive
technology (Devlin and Tait, 1998; Alu??sio and
Gasperin, 2010), although this is not always the
case. It may also be used alongside other tech-
nologies such as summarisation to improve their
final results.
Identifying CWs is a task which every lexical
simplification system must perform, either explic-
itly or implicitly, before simplification can take
place. CWs are difficult to define, which makes
them difficult to identify. For example, take the
following sentence:
The four largest islands are Honshu,
Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and
there are approximately 3,000 smaller
islands in the chain.
In the above sentence, we might identify the
proper nouns (Honshu, Hokkaido, etc.) as com-
plex (as they may be unfamiliar) or we may choose
to discount them from our scheme altogether, as
proper nouns are unlikely to have any valid re-
placements. If we discount the proper nouns then
the other valid CW would be ?approximately?. At
13 characters it is more than twice the average of
5.7 characters per word and has more syllables
than any other word. Further, CWs are often iden-
tified by their frequency (see Section 2.1) and here,
103
?approximately? exhibits a much lower frequency
than the other words.
There are many reasons to evaluate the identi-
fication of CWs. This research stems primarily
from the discovery that no previous comparison of
current techniques exists. It is hoped that by pro-
viding this, the community will be able to iden-
tify and evaluate new techniques using the meth-
ods proposed herein. If CW identification is not
performed well, then potential candidates may be
missed, and simple words may be falsely identi-
fied. This is dangerous as simplification will often
result in a minor change in a text?s semantics. For
example, the sentence:
The United Kingdom is a state in
northwest Europe.
May be simplified to give:
The United Kingdom is a country in
northwest Europe.
In this example from the corpus used in this
research, the word ?state? is simplified to give
?country?. Whilst this is a valid synonym in the
given context, state and country are not necessar-
ily semantically identical. Broadly speaking, state
refers to a political entity, whereas country refers
to a physical space within a set of borders. This is
an acceptable change and even necessary for sim-
plification. However, if applied blindly, then too
many modifications may be made, resulting in ma-
jor deviations from the text?s original semantics.

the evaluation phase. Section 2.2.

chine for the classification of CWs. Section

2 Experimental Design
Several systems for detecting CWs were imple-
mented and evaluated using the CW corpus. The
two main techniques that exist in the literature
are simplifying everything (Devlin and Tait, 1998)

and frequency based thresholding (Zeng et al,
2005). These were implemented as well as a sup-
port vector machine classifier. This section de-
scribes the design decisions made during imple-
mentation.
2.1 Lexical Complexity
All three of the implementations described in Sec-
tions 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 require a word frequency
measure as an indicator of lexical complexity. If a
word occurs frequently in common language then
it is more likely to be recognised (Rayner and
Duffy, 1986).
The lexical simplification dataset from Task 1
at SemEval 2012 (De Belder and Moens, 2012)
was used to compare several measures of word
frequency as shown in Table 1. Candidate sub-
stitutions and sample sentences were provided by
the task organisers, together with a gold standard
ranking of the substitutes according to their sim-
plicity. These sentences were ranked according
to their frequency. Although the scores in Table
1 appear to be low, this is the kappa agreement
for several categories and so should be expected.
The inter-annotator agreement on the corpus was
0.488 (De Belder and Moens, 2012). The SUB-
TLEX dataset (Brysbaert and New, 2009) was the
best available for rating word familiarity. This is
a corpus of over 70,000 words collected from the
subtitles of over 8,000 American English films.
104
2.2 CW Corpus
Simple Wikipedia edit histories were mined using
techniques similar to those in Yatskar et al (2010).
This provided aligned pairs of sentences which
had just one word simplified. Whereas Yatskar
et al (2010) used these pairs to learn probabili-
ties of paraphrases, the research in this paper used
them as instances of lexical simplification. The
original simplifications were performed by editors
trying to make documents as simple as possible.
The CW is identified by comparison with the sim-
plified sentence. Further information on the pro-
duction of the corpus will be published in a future
paper.
2.3 Negative Examples
The CW corpus provides a set of CWs in appro-
priate contexts. This is useful for evaluation as
these words need to be identified. However, if
only examples of CWs were available, it would be
very easy for a technique to overfit ? as it could
just classify every single word as complex and
get 100% accuracy. For example, in the case of
thresholding, if only examples of CWs are avail-
able, the threshold could be set artificially high
and still succeed for every case. When this is ap-
plied to genuine data it will classify every word it
encounters as complex, leading to high recall but
low precision.
To alleviate this effect, negative examples are
needed. These are examples of simple words
which do not require any further simplification.
There are several methods for finding these, in-
cluding: selecting words from a reference easy
word list; selecting words with high frequencies
according to some corpus or using the simplified
words from the second sentences in the CW cor-
pus. The chosen strategy picked a word at random
from the sentence in which the CW occurs. Only
one word was edited in this sentence and so the
assumption may be made that none of the other
words in the sentence require further simplifica-
tion. Only one simple word per CW is chosen to
enforce an even amount of positive and negative
data. This gave a set of negative words which were
reflective of the broad language which is expected
when processing free text.
2.4 Simplify Everything
The first implementation involved simplifying ev-
erything, a brute force method, in which a simpli-
fication algorithm is applied to every word. This
assumes that words which are already simple will
not require any further simplification. A com-
mon variation is to limit the simplification to some
combination of all the nouns, verbs and adjectives.
A standard baseline lexical simplification sys-
tem was implemented following Devlin and Tait
(1998). This algorithm generated a set of syn-
onyms from WordNet and then used the SUB-
TLEX frequencies to find the most frequent syn-
onym. If the synonym was more frequent than the
original word then a substitution was made. This
technique was applied to all the words. If a CW
was changed, then it was considered a true posi-
tive; if a simple word was not changed, it was con-
sidered a true negative. Five trials were carried out
and the average accuracy and standard deviation is
reported in Figure 1 and Table 3.
2.5 Frequency Thresholding
The second technique is frequency thresholding.
This relies on each word having an associated fa-
miliarity value provided by the SUBTLEX corpus.
Whilst this corpus is large, it will never cover ev-
ery possible word, and so words which are not en-
countered are considered to have a frequency of 0.
This does not affect comparison as the infrequent
words are likely to be the complex ones.
To distinguish between complex and simple
words a threshold was implemented. This was
learnt from the CW corpus by examining every
possible threshold for a training set. Firstly, the
training data was ordered by frequency, then the
accuracy1 of the algorithm was examined with the
threshold placed in between the frequency of every
adjacent pair of words in the ordered list. This was
repeated by 5-fold cross validation and the mean
threshold determined. The final accuracy of the
algorithm was then determined on a separate set
of testing data.
2.6 Support Vector Machine
Support vector machines (SVM) are statistical
classifiers which use labelled training data to pre-
dict the class of unseen inputs. The training data
consist of several features which the SVM uses
to distinguish between classes. The SVM was
chosen as it has been used elsewhere for similar
tasks (Gasperin et al, 2009; Hancke et al, 2012;
Jauhar and Specia, 2012). The use of many fea-

tures allows factors which may otherwise have
been missed to be taken into account. One fur-
ther advantage is that the features of an SVM can
be analysed to determine their effect on the classi-
fication. This may give some indication for future
feature classification schemes.
The SVM was trained using the LIBSVM pack-
age (Chang and Lin, 2011) in Matlab. the RBF
kernel was selected and a grid search was per-
formed to select values for the 2 parameters C and
?. Training and testing was performed on a held-
out data-set using 5-fold cross validation.
To implement the SVM a set of features was
determined for the classification scheme. Several
external libraries were used to extract these as de-
tailed below:
Frequency The SUBTLEX frequency of each
word was used as previously described in
Section 2.1.
CD Count Also from the SUBTLEX corpus. The
number of films in which a word appeared,
ranging from 0? 8, 388.
Length The word length in number of characters
was taken into account. It is often the case
that longer words are more difficult to pro-
cess and so may be considered ?complex?.
Syllable Count The number of syllables con-
tained in a word is also a good estimate of
its complexity. This was computed using a
library from the morphadorner package2.
Sense Count A count of the number of ways in
which a word can be interpreted - showing
how ambiguous a word is. This measure is
taken from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
Synonym Count Also taken from WordNet, this
is the number of potential synonyms with
which a word could be replaced. This again
may give some indication of a word?s degree
of ambiguity.

Table 2: The correlation coefficients for
each feature. These show the correlation
against the language?s simplicity and so
a positive correlation indicates that if that
feature is higher then the word will be
simpler.
To analyse the features of the SVM, the corre-
lation coefficient between each feature vector and
the vector of feature labels was calculated. This is
a measure which can be used to show the relation
between two distributions. The adopted labelling
scheme assigned CWs as 0 and simple words as 1
and so the correlation of the features is notionally
against the simplicity of the words.3 The results
are reported in Table 2.
4 Discussion
It is clear from these results that there is a fairly
high accuracy from all the methods. This shows
that they perform well at the task in hand, reflect-
ing the methods which have been previously ap-
plied. These methods all have a higher recall than
3i.e. A positive correlation indicates that if the value of
that feature is higher, the word will be simpler.

precision, which indicates that they are good at
identifying the CWs, but also that they often iden-
tify simple words as CWs. This is particularly
noticeable in the ?simplify everything? method,
where the recall is very high, yet the precision is
comparatively low. This indicates that many of the
simple words which are falsely identified as com-
plex are also replaced with an alternate substitu-
tion, which may result in a change in sense.
A paired t-test showed the difference between
the thresholding method and the ?simplify ev-
erything? method was not statistically significant
(p > 0.8). Thresholding takes more data about
the words into account and would appear to be a
less na??ve strategy than blindly simplifying every-
thing. However, this data shows there is little dif-
ference between the results of the two methods.
The thresholding here may be limited by the re-
sources, and a corpus using a larger word count
may yield an improved result.
Whilst the thresholding and simplify everything
methods were not significantly different from each
other, the SVM method was significantly differ-
ent from the other two (p < 0.001). This can be
seen in the slightly lower recall, yet higher preci-
sion attained by the SVM. This indicates that the
SVM was better at distinguishing between com-
plex and simple words, but also wrongly identified
many CWs. The results for the SVM have a wide
standard deviation (shown in the wide error bars in
Figure 1) indicating a higher variability than the
other methods. With more data for training the
model, this variability may be reduced.
One important factor in the increased precision
observed in the SVM is that it used many more
features than the other methods, and so took more
information into account. Table 2 shows that these
features had varying degrees of correlation with
the data label (i.e. whether the word was simple
or not) and hence that they had varying degrees of
effect on the classification scheme.
Frequency and CD count are moderately posi-
tively correlated as may be expected. This indi-
cates that higher frequency words are likely to be
simple. Surprisingly, CD Count has a higher cor-
relation than frequency itself, indicating that this is
a better measure of word familiarity than the fre-
quency measure. However, further investigation is
necessary to confirm this.
Word length and number of syllables are mod-
erately negatively correlated, indicating that the
longer and more polysyllabic a word is, the less
simple it becomes. This is not true in every case.
For example, ?finger? and ?digit? can be used in
the same sense (as a noun meaning an appendage
of the hand). Whilst ?finger? is more commonly
used than ?digit?4, digit is one letter shorter.
The number of senses was very weakly nega-
tively correlated with word simplicity. This in-
dicates that it is not a strong indicative factor in
determining whether a word is simple or not. The
total number of synonyms was a stronger indicator
than the number of senses, but still only exhibited
weak correlation.
One area that has not been explored in this study
is the use of contextual features. Each target word
occurs in a sentence and it may be the case that
those words surrounding the target give extra in-
formation as to its complexity. It has been sug-
gested that language is produced at an even level
of complexity (Specia et al, 2012), and so simple
words will occur in the presence of other simple
words, whereas CWs will occur in the presence
of other CWs. As well as lexical contextual in-
formation, the surrounding syntax may offer some
information on word difficulty. Factors such as
a very long sentence or a complex grammatical
structure can make a word more difficult to under-
stand. These could be used to modify the familiar-
ity score in the thresholding method, or they could
be used as features in the SVM classifier.

used as a precursor to lexical simplification. This
section will explain how these previous methods
have handled the task of identifying CWs and how
these fit into the research presented in this paper.
The simplest way to identify CWs in a sentence
is to blindly assume that every word is complex, as
described earlier in Section 2.4. This was first used
in Devlin?s seminal work on lexical simplification
(Devlin and Tait, 1998). This method is some-
what na??ve as it does not mitigate the possibility
of words being simplified in error. Devlin and Tait
indicate that they believe less frequent words will
not be subject to meaning change. However, fur-
ther work into lexical simplification has refuted
this (Lal and Ru?ger, 2002). This method is still
used, for example Thomas and Anderson (2012)
simplify all nouns and verbs. This corresponds to
the ?Everything? method.
Another method of identifying CWs is to use
frequency based thresholding over word familiar-
ity scores, as described in Section 2.5 and corre-
sponding to the ?Frequency? method in this pa-
per. This has been applied to the medical domain
(Zeng et al, 2005; Elhadad, 2006) for predicting
which words lay readers will find difficult. This
has been correlated with word difficulty via ques-
tionnaires (Zeng et al, 2005; Zeng-Treitler et al,
2008) and via the analysis of low-level readabil-
ity corpora (Elhadad, 2006). In both these cases,
a familiarity score is used to determine how likely
a subject is to understand a term. More recently,
Bott et al (2012) use a threshold of 1% corpus
frequency, along with other checks, to ensure that
simple words are not erroneously simplified.
Support vector machines are powerful statisti-
cal classifiers, as employed in the ?SVM? method
of this paper. A Support Vector Machine is used
to predict the familiarity of CWs in Zeng et al
(2005). It takes features of term frequency and
word length and is correlated against the familiar-
ity scores which are already obtained. This proves
to have very poor performance, something which
the authors attribute to a lack of suitable train-
ing data. An SVM has also been trained for the
ranking of words according to their complexity
(Jauhar and Specia, 2012). This was done for the
SemEval lexical simplification task (Specia et al,
2012). Although this system is designed for syn-
onym ranking, it could also be used for the CW
identification task. Machine learning has also been
applied to the task of determining whether an en-
tire sentence requires simplification (Gasperin et
al., 2009; Hancke et al, 2012). These approaches
use a wide array of morphological features which
are suited to sentence level classification.
6 Future Work
This work is intended as an initial study of meth-
ods for identifying CWs for simplification. The
methods compared, whilst typical of current CW
identification methods, are not an exhaustive set
and variations exist. One further way of expanding
this research would be to take into account word
context. This could be done using thresholding
(Zeng-Treitler et al, 2008) or an SVM (Gasperin
et al, 2009; Jauhar and Specia, 2012).
Another way to increase the accuracy of the fre-
quency count method may be to use a larger cor-
pus. Whilst the corpus used in this paper per-
formed well in the preliminary testing section,
other research has shown the Google Web1T cor-
pus (a n-gram count of over a trillion words) to be
more effective (De Belder and Moens, 2012). The
Web 1T data was not available during the course
of this research.
The large variability in accuracy shown in the
SVM method indicates that there was insufficient
training data. With more data, the SVM would
have more information about the classification
task and would provide more consistent results.
CW identification is the first step in the process
of lexical simplification. This research will be in-
tegrated in a future system which will simplify
natural language for end users. It is also hoped
that other lexical simplification systems will take
account of this work and will use the evaluation
technique proposed herein to improve their identi-
fication of CWs.
7 Conclusion
This paper has provided an insight into the chal-
lenges associated with evaluating the identifica-
tion of CWs. This is a non-obvious task, which
may seem intuitively easy, but in reality is quite
difficult and rarely performed. It is hoped that
new research in this field will evaluate the tech-
niques used, rather than using inadequate tech-
niques blindly and na??vely. This research has also
shown that the current state of the art methods
have much room for improvement. Low precision
is a constant factor in all techniques and future re-
search should aim to address this.
