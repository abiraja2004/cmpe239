Abstract
This paper presents one of the two contribu-
tions from the Universidad Complutense de
Madrid to the *SEM Shared Task 2012 on Re-
solving the Scope and Focus of Negation. We
describe a rule-based system for detecting the
presence of negations and delimitating their
scope. It was initially intended for process-
ing negation in opinionated texts, and has been
adapted to fit the task requirements. It first
detects negation cues using a list of explicit
negation markers (such as not or nothing), and
infers other implicit negations (such as affixal
negations, e.g, undeniable or improper) by us-
ing semantic information from WordNet con-
cepts and relations. It next uses the informa-
tion from the syntax tree of the sentence in
which the negation arises to get a first approxi-
mation to the negation scope, which is later re-
fined using a set of post-processing rules that
bound or expand such scope.
1 Introduction
Detecting negation is important for many NLP tasks,
as it may reverse the meaning of the text affected
by it. In information extraction, for instance, it is
obviously important to distinguish negated informa-
tion from affirmative one (Kim and Park, 2006). It
may also improve automatic indexing (Mutalik et
al., 2001). In sentiment analysis, detecting and deal-
ing with negation is critical, as it may change the
polarity of a text (Wiegand et al., 2010). How-
ever, research on negation has mainly focused on the
biomedical domain, and addressed the problem of
detecting if a medical term is negated or not (Chap-
man et al., 2001), or the scope of different negation
signals (Morante et al., 2008).
During the last years, the importance of process-
ing negation is gaining recognition by the NLP re-
search community, as evidenced by the success of
several initiatives such as the Negation and Spec-
ulation in Natural Language Processing workshop
(NeSp-NLP 2010)1 or the CoNLL-2010 Shared
Task2, which aimed at identifying hedges and their
scope in natural language texts. In spite of this, most
of the approaches proposed so far deal with negation
in a superficial manner.
This paper describes our contribution to the
*SEM Shared Task 2012 on Resolving the Scope
and Focus of Negation. As its name suggests, the
task aims at detecting the scope and focus of nega-
tion, as a means of encouraging research in negation
processing. In particular, we participate in Task 1:
scope detection. For each negation in the text, the
negation cue must be detected, and its scope marked.
Moreover, the event or property that is negated must
be recognized. A comprehensive description of the
task may be found in (Morante and Blanco, 2012).
For the sake of clarity, it is important to define
what the organization of the task understands by
negation cue, scope of negation and negated event.
The words that express negation are called negation
cues. Not and no are common examples of such
cues. Scope is defined as the part of the mean-
ing that is negated, and encloses all negated con-
cepts. The negated event is the property that is
1http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010/
2www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/conll2010st/
282
negated by the cue. For instance, in the sentence:
[Holmes] did not [say anything], the scope is en-
closed in square brackets, the negation cue is under-
lined and the negated event is shown in bold. More
details about the annotation of negation cues, scopes
and negated events may be found in (Morante and
Daelemans, 2012).
The system presented to the shared task is an
adaptation of the one published in (Carrillo de Al-
bornoz et al., 2010), whose aim was to detect and
process negation in opinionated text in order to im-
prove polarity and intensity classification. When
classifying sentiments and opinions it is important
to deal with the presence of negations and their ef-
fect on the emotional meaning of the text affected by
them. Consider the sentence (1) and (2). Sentence
(1) expresses a positive opinion, whereas that in sen-
tence (2) the negation word not reverses the polarity
of such opinion.
(1) I liked this hotel.
(2) I didn?t like this hotel.
Our system has the main advantage of being sim-
ple and highly generic. Even though it was origi-
nally conceived for treating negations in opinionated
texts, a few simple modifications have been suffi-
cient to successfully address negation in a very dif-
ferent type of texts, such as Conan Doyle stories. It
is rule-based and does not need to be trained. It also
uses semantic information in order to automatically
detect the negation cues.
2 Methodology
As already told, the UCM-I system is a modified ver-
sion of the one presented in (Carrillo de Albornoz
et al., 2010). Next sections detail the modifications
performed to undertake the present task.
2.1 Detecting negation cues
Our previous work was focused on explicit nega-
tions (i.e., those introduced by negation tokens such
as not, never). In contrast, in the present work
we also consider what we call implicit negations,
which includes affixal negation (i.,e., words with
prefixes such as dis-, un- or suffixes such as -less;
e.g., impatient or careless), inffixal negation (i.e.,
pointlessness, where the negation cue less is in the
middle of the noun phrase). Note that we did not
Table 1: Examples of negation cues.
Explicit negation cues
no not non nor
nobody never nowhere ...
Words with implicit negation cues
unpleasant unnatural dislike impatient
fearless hopeless illegal ...
have into account these negation cues when ana-
lyzing opinionated texts because these words them-
selves usually appear in affective lexicons with their
corresponding polarity values (i.e., impatient, for in-
stance, appears in SentiWordNet with a negative po-
larity value).
In order to detect negation cues, we use a list of
predefined negation signals, along with an automatic
method for detecting new ones. The list has been
extracted from different previous works (Councill et
al., 2010; Morante, 2010). This list also includes the
most frequent contracted forms (e.g., don?t, didn?t,
etc.). The automated method, in turn, is intended
for discovering in text new affixal negation cues. To
this end, we first find in the text all words with pre-
fixes dis-, a-, un-, in-, im-, non-, il-, ir- and the suf-
fix -less that present the appropriate part of speech.
Since not all words with such affixes are negation
cues, we use semantic information from WordNet
concepts and relations to decide. In this way, we re-
trieve from WordNet the synset that correspond to
each word, using WordNet::SenseRelate (Patward-
han et al., 2005) to correctly disambiguate the mean-
ing of the word according to its context, along with
all its antonym synsets. We next check if, after re-
moving the affix, the word exists in WordNet and
belongs to any of the antonym synsets. If so, we
consider the original word to be a negation cue (i.e.,
the word without the affix has the opposite meaning
than the lexical item with the affix).
Table 1 presents some examples of explicit nega-
tion cues and words with implicit negation cues. For
space reasons, not all cues are shown. We also con-
sider common spelling errors such as the omission
of apostrophes (e.g., isnt or nt). They are not likely
to be found in literary texts, but are quite frequent in
user-generated content.
This general processing is, however, improved
with two rules:
283
Table 2: Examples of false negation cues.
no doubt without a doubt not merely not just
not even not only no wonder ...
1. False negation cues: Some negation words
may be also used in other expressions with-
out constituting a negation, as in sentence (3).
Therefore, when the negation token belongs
to such expressions, this is not processed as a
negation. Examples of false negation cues are
shown in Table 2.
(3) ... the evidence may implicate not only your
friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as well.
2. Tag questions: Some sentences in the cor-
pora present negative tag questions in old En-
glish grammatical form, as it may shown in
sentences (4) and (5). We have implemented a
specific rule to deal with this type of construc-
tions, so that they are not treated as negations.
(4) You could easily recognize it , could you not?.
(5) But your family have been with us for several
generations , have they not?
2.2 Delimiting the scope of negation
The scope of a negation is determined by using the
syntax tree of the sentence in which the negation
arises, as generated by the Stanford Parser.3 To this
end, we find in the syntax tree the first common an-
cestor that encloses the negation token and the word
immediately after it, and assume all descendant leaf
nodes to the right of the negation token to be af-
fected by it. This process may be seen in Figure
1, where the syntax tree for the sentence: [Watson
did] not [solve the case] is shown. In this sentence,
the method identifies the negation token not and as-
sumes its scope to be all descendant leaf nodes of the
common ancestor of the words not and solve (i.e.,
solve the case).
This modeling has the main advantage of being
highly generic, as it serves to delimit the scope of
negation regardless of what the negated event is (i.e.,
the verb, the subject, the object of the verb, an ad-
jective or an adverb). As shown in (Carrillo de Al-
3http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml
Figure 1: Syntax tree of the sentence: Watson did not
solve the case.
bornoz et al., 2010), it behaves well when determin-
ing the scope of negation for the purpose of classi-
fying product reviews in polarity classes. However,
we have found that this scope is not enough for the
present task, and thus we have implemented a set of
post-processing rules to expand and limit the scope
according to the task guidelines:
1. Expansion to subject. This rule expands the
negation scope in order to include the subject of
the sentence within it. In this way, in sentence
(6) the appropriate rule is fired to include ?This
theory? within the negation scope.
(6) [This theory would] not [work].
It must be noted that, for polarity classifica-
tion purposes, we do not consider the subject
of the sentence to be part of this scope. Con-
sider, for instance, the sentence: The beauti-
ful views of the Eiffel Tower are not guaranteed
in all rooms. According to traditional polarity
classification approaches, if the subject is con-
sidered as part of the negation scope, the polar-
ity of the positive polar expression ?beautiful?
should be changed, and considered as negative.
2. Subordinate boundaries. Our original nega-
tion scope detection method works well with
coordinate sentences, in which negation cues
scope only over their clause, as if a ?boundary?
exists between the different clauses. This oc-
curs, for instance, in the sentence:
284
Table 3: List of negation scope delimiters.
Tokens POS
so, because, if, while
INuntil, since, unless
before, than, despite IN
what, whose WP
why, where WRB
however RB
?,?, - , :, ;, (, ), !, ?, . -
(7) [It may be that you are] not [yourself lumi-
nous], but you are a conductor of light.
It also works properly in subordinate sentences,
when the negation occurs in the subordinate
clause, as in: You can imagine my surprise
when I found that [there was] no [one there].
However, it may fail in some types of subor-
dinate sentences, where the scope should be
limited to the main clause, but our model pre-
dict both clauses to be affected by the negation.
This is the case for the sentences where the de-
pendent clause is introduced by the subordinate
conjunctions in Table 3. An example of such
type of sentence is (8), where the conjunction
token because introduces a subordinate clause
which is out of the negation scope. To solve this
problem, the negation scope detection method
includes a set of rules to delimit the scope in
those cases, using as delimiters the conjunc-
tions in Table 3. Note that, since some of these
delimiters are ambiguous, their part of speech
tags are used to disambiguate them.
(8) [Her father] refused [to have anything to do
with her] because she had married without his
consent.
3. Prepositional phrases: Our original method
also fails to correctly determine the negation
scope when the negated event is followed by
a prepositional phrase, as it may be seen in
Figure 2, where the syntax tree for the sen-
tence: [There was] no [attempt at robbery] is
shown. Note that, according to our original
model, the phrase ?at robbery? does not belong
to the negation scope. This is an error that was
not detected before, but has been fixed for the
present task.
Figure 2: Syntax tree for the sentence: There was no at-
tempt at robbery.
2.3 Finding negated events
We only consider a single type of negated events,
so that, when a cue word contains a negative affix,
the word after removing the affix is annotated as the
negated event. In this way, ?doubtedly? is correctly
annotated as the negated event in sentence (9). How-
ever, the remaining types of negated events are rele-
gated to future work.
(9) [The oval seal is] undoubtedly [a plain
sleeve-link].
3 Evaluation Setup
The data collection consists of a development set, a
training set, and two test sets of 787, 3644, 496 and
593 sentences, respectively from different stories by
Conan Doyle (see (Morante and Blanco, 2012) for
details). Performance is measured in terms of recall,
precision and F-measure for the following subtasks:
? Predicting negation cues.
? Predicting both the scope and cue.
? Predicting the scope, the cue does not need to
be correct.
? Predicting the scope tokens, where not a full
scope match is required.
? Predicting negated events.
? Full evaluation, which requires all elements to
be correct.

4 Evaluation Results
The results of our system when evaluated on the de-
velopment set and the two test sets (both jointly and
separately), are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6.
It may be seen from these tables that our sys-
tem behaves quite well in the prediction of negation
cues subtask, achieving around 90% F-measure in
all data sets, and the second position in the com-
petition. Performance in the scope prediction task,
however, is around 60% F-1, and the same results
are obtained if the correct prediction of cues is re-
quired (Scope (cue match)). This seems to indicate
that, for all correct scope predictions, our system
have also predicted the negation cues correctly. Ob-
viously these results improve for the Scope tokens
measure, achieving more than 77% F-1 for the Card-
board data set. We also got the second position in
the competition for these three subtasks. Concerning
detection of negated events, our system gets poor re-
sults, 22.85% and 19.81% F-1, respectively, in each
test data set. These results affect the performance
of the full negation prediction task, where we get
32.18% and 32.96% F-1, respectively. Surprisingly,
the result in the test sets are slightly better than those
in the development set, and this is due to a better be-
havior of the WordNet-based cue detection method
in the formers than in the later.
5 Discussion
We next discuss and analyze the results above.
Firstly, and regarding detection of negation cues, our
initial list covers all explicit negations in the devel-
opment set, while the detection of affixal negation
cues using our WordNet-based method presents a
precision of 100% but a recall of 53%. In particu-
lar, our method fails when discovering negation cues
such as unburned, uncommonly or irreproachable,
where the word after removing the affix is a derived
form of a verb or adjective.
Secondly, and concerning delimitation of the
scope, our method behaves considerably well. We
have found that it correctly annotates the negation
scope when the negation affects the predicate that
expresses the event, but sometimes fails to include
the subject of the sentence in such scope, as in:
[I know absolutely] nothing [about the fate of this
man], where our method only recognizes as the
negation scope the terms about the fate of this man.
The results have also shown that the method fre-
quently fails when the subject of the sentence or the
object of an event are negated. This occurs, for
instance, in sentences: I think, Watson, [a brandy
and soda would do him] no [harm] and No [woman
would ever send a reply-paid telegram], where we
only point to ?harm? and ?woman? as the scopes.
We have found a further category of errors in the
scope detection tasks, which concern some types
of complex sentences with subordinate conjunctions
where our method limits the negation scope to the
main clause, as in sentence: [Where they came from,
or who they are,] nobody [has an idea] , where our
method limits the scope to ?has an idea?. However,
if the negation cue occurs in the subordinate clause,
the method behaves correctly.
Thirdly, with respect to negated event detection,
as already told our method gets quite poor results.
This was expected, since our system was not orig-
inally designed to face this task and thus it only
covers one type of negated events. Specifically,
it correctly identifies the negated events for sen-
tences with affixal negation cues, as in: It is most
improper, most outrageous, where the negated event
is ?proper?. However, it usually fails to identify
these events when the negation affects the subject
of the sentence or the object of an event.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper presents one of the two contributions
from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid to the
*SEM Shared Task 2012. The results have shown
that our method successes in identifying negation
cues and performs reasonably well when determin-
ing the negation scope, which seems to indicate that
a simple unsupervised method based on syntactic in-
formation and a reduced set of post-processing rules

is a viable approach for dealing with negation. How-
ever, detection of negated events is the main weak-
ness of our approach, and this should be tackled in
future work. We also plan to improve our method
for detecting affixal negations to increment its recall,
by using further WordNet relations such as ?derived
from adjective?, and ?pertains to noun?, as well as
to extend this method to detect infixal negations.
