Abstract
This paper proposes a method for identify-
ing synonymous relations in a bilingual lex-
icon, which is a set of translation-equivalent
term pairs. We train a classifier for identi-
fying those synonymous relations by using
spelling variations as main clues. We com-
pared two approaches: the direct identifi-
cation of bilingual synonym pairs, and the
merger of two monolingual synonyms. We
showed that our approach achieves a high
pair-wise precision and recall, and outper-
forms the baseline method.
1 Introduction
Automatically collecting synonyms from language
resources is an ongoing task for natural language
processing (NLP). Most NLP systems have diffi-
culties in dealing with synonyms, which are differ-
ent representations that have the same meaning in
a language. Information retrieval (IR) could lever-
age synonyms to improve the coverage of search re-
sults (Qiu and Frei, 1993). For example, when we
input the query ?transportation in India? into an IR
system, the system can expand the query to its syn-
onyms; e.g. ?transport? and ?railway?, to find more
documents.
This paper proposes a method for the automatic
identification of bilingual synonyms in a bilingual
lexicon, with spelling variation clues. A bilingual
synonym set is a set of translation-equivalent term
pairs sharing the same meaning. Although a number
of studies have aimed at identifying synonyms, this
is the first study that simultaneously finds synonyms
in two languages, to our best knowledge.
Let us consider the case where a user enters the
Japanese query ?ko?jo?? (??, industrial plant) into a
cross-lingual IR system to find English documents.
After translating the query into the English trans-
lation equivalent, ?plant,? the cross-lingual IR sys-
tem may expand the query to its English synonyms,
e.g. ?factory,? and ?workshop,? and retrieve docu-
ments that include the expanded terms. However,
the term ?plant? is ambiguous; the system may also
expand the query to ?vegetable,? and the system is
prevented by the term which is different from our
intention. In contrast, the system can easily reject
the latter expansion, ?vegetable,? if we are aware of
bilingual synonyms, which indicate synonymous re-
lations over bilingual lexicons: (ko?jo?, plant)? (ko?jo?,
factory) and (shokubutsu1, plant) ? (shokubutsu,
vegetable)2 (See Figure 1). The expression of the
translation equivalent, (ko?jo?, plant), helps a cross-
lingual IR system to retrieve documents that include
the term ?plant,? used in the meaning for ko?jo?, or in-
dustrial plants.
We present a supervised machine learning ap-
proach for identifying bilingual synonyms. Design-
ing features for bilingual synonyms such as spelling
variations and bilingual associations, we train a clas-
sifier with a manually annotated bilingual lexicon
with synonymous information. In order to evaluate
the performance of our method, we carried out ex-
periments to identify bilingual synonyms by two ap-
proaches: the direct identification of bilingual syn-
onym pairs, and bilingual synonym pairs merged
from two monolingual synonym lists. Experimental
results show that our approach achieves the F-scores

ploys only bilingual relations as its clues.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. The next section describes related work on
synonym extraction and spelling variations. Section
3 describes the overview and definition of bilingual
synonyms, the proposed method and employed fea-
tures. In Section 4 we evaluate our method and con-
clude this paper.
2 Related work
There have been many approaches for detecting syn-
onyms and constructing thesauri. Two main re-
sources for synonym extraction are large text cor-
pora and dictionaries.
Many studies extract synonyms from large mono-
lingual corpora by using context information around
target terms (Croach and Yang, 1992; Park and Choi,
1996; Waterman, 1996; Curran, 2004). Some re-
searchers (Hindle, 1990; Grefenstette, 1994; Lin,
1998) classify terms by similarities based on their
distributional syntactic patterns. These methods of-
ten extract not only synonyms, but also semantically
related terms, such as antonyms, hyponyms and co-
ordinate terms such as ?cat? and ?dog.?
Some studies make use of bilingual corpora or
dictionaries to find synonyms in a target language
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and
Sumita, 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Lin et al, 2003).
Lin et al (2003) chose a set of synonym candidates
for a term by using a bilingual dictionary and com-
puting distributional similarities in the candidate set
to extract synonyms. They adopt the bilingual in-
formation to exclude non-synonyms (e.g., antonyms
and hyponyms) that may be used in the similar con-
texts. Although they make use of bilingual dictio-
naries, this study aims at finding bilingual synonyms
directly.
In the approaches based on monolingual dictio-
naries, the similarities of definitions of lexical items
are important clues for identifying synonyms (Blon-
del et al, 2004; Muller et al, 2006). For instance,
Blondel et al (2004) constructed an associated dic-
tionary graph whose vertices are the terms, and
whose edges from v1 to v2 represent occurrence of
v2 in the definition for v1. They choose synonyms
from the graph by collecting terms pointed to and
from the same terms.
Another strategy for finding synonyms is to con-
sider the terms themselves. We divide it into two
approaches: rule-based and distance-based.
Rule-based approaches implement rules with
language-specific patterns and detect variations by
applying rules to terms. Stemming (Lovins, 1968;
Porter, 1980) is one of the rule-based approaches,
which cuts morphological suffix inflections, and ob-
tains the stems of words. There are other types of
variations for phrases; for example, insertion, dele-
tion or substitution of words, and permutation of
words such as ?view point? and ?point of view? are
such variations (Daille et al, 1996).
Distance-based approaches model the similarity
or dissimilarity measure between two terms to find
similar terms. The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966)
is the most widely-used measure, based on the mini-
mum number of operations of insertion, deletion, or
substitution of characters for transforming one term
into another. It can be efficiently calculated by using

3 Bilingual Synonyms and Translation
Equivalents
This section describes the notion of bilingual syn-
onyms and our method for identifying the synony-
mous pairs of translation equivalents. We consider a
bilingual synonym as a set of translation-equivalent
term pairs referring to the same concept.
Tables 1 and 2 are an example of bilingual
synonym sets. There are ten Japanese-English
translation-equivalent term pairs and five bilingual
synonym sets in this example. A Japanese term
?raito? is the phonetic transcription of both ?light?
and ?right,? and it covers four concepts described by
the three English terms. Figure 2 illustrates the re-
lationship among these terms. The synonymous re-
lation and the translation equivalence are considered
to be similar in that two terms share the meanings.
Following synonymous relation between terms in
one language, we deal with the synonymous relation
between bilingual translation-equivalent term pairs
Figure 2: Relations among terms in Table 2
Solid lines show that two terms are translation
equivalents, while dotted lines show that two terms
are (monolingual) synonyms.
as bilingual synonyms. The advantage of manag-
ing the lexicon in the format of bilingual synonyms
is that we can facilitate to tie the concepts and the
terms.
3.1 Definitions
Let E and F be monolingual lexicons. We first as-
sume that a term e ? E (or f ? F ) refers to one
or more concepts, and define that a term e is a syn-
onym3 of e?(? E) if and only if e and e? share an
identical concept4. Let ??? represent the synony-
mous relation, and this relation is not transitive be-
cause a term often has several concepts:
e ? e? ? e? ? e?? 6=? e ? e??. (1)
We define a synonym set (synset) Ec as a set whose
elements share an identical concept c: Ec = {e ?
E|?e refers to c}. For a term set Ec(? E),
Ec is a synonym set (synset)
=? ?e, e? ? Ec e ? e? (2)
is true, but the converse is not necessarily true, be-
cause of the ambiguity of terms. Note that one term
can belong to multiple synonym sets from the defi-
nition.
Let D(? F ? E) be a bilingual lexicon defined
as a set of term pairs (f, e) (f ? F, e ? E) satis-
fying that f and e refer to an identical concept. We
3For distinguishing from bilingual synonyms, we often call
the synonym a monolingual synonym.
4The definition of concepts, that is, the criteria of deciding
whether two terms are synonymous or not, is beyond the fo-
cus of this paper. We do not assume that related terms such as
hypernyms, hyponyms and coordinates are kinds of synonyms.
In our experiments the criteria depend on manual annotation of
synonym IDs in the training data.
459
call these pairs translation equivalents, which refer
to concepts that both f and e refer to. We define
that two bilingual lexical items p and p?(? D) are
bilingual synonyms if and only if p and p? refer to an
identical concept in common with the definition of
(monolingual) synonyms. This relation is not tran-
sitive again, and if e ? e? and f ? f ?, it is not
necessarily true that p ? p?:
e ? e? ? f ? f ? 6=? p ? p? (3)
because of the ambiguity of terms. Similarly, we
can define a bilingual synonym set (synset) Dc as
a set whose elements share an identical meaning c:
Dc = {p ? D|?p refers to c}. For a set of transla-
tion eqiuvalents Dc,
Dc is a bilingual synonym set (synset)
=? ?p, p? ? Dc p ? p? (4)
is true, but the converse is not necessarily true.
3.2 Identifying bilingual synonym pairs
In this section, we describe an algorithm to identify
bilingual synonym pairs by using spelling variation
clues. After identifying the pairs, we can construct
bilingual synonym sets by assuming that the con-
verse of the condition (4) is true, and finding sets
of bilingual lexical items in which all paired items
are bilingual synonyms. We can see this method
as the complete-linkage clustering of translation-
equivalent term pairs. We can adopt another option
to construct them by assuming also that the bilingual
synonymous relation has transitivity: p ? p? ? p? ?
p?? =? p ? p??, and this can be seen as simple-
linkage clustering. This simplified method ignores
the ambiguity of terms, and it may construct a bilin-
gual synonym sets which includes many senses. In
spite of the risk, it is effective to find large synonym
sets in case the bilingual synonym pairs are not suf-
ficiently detected. In this paper we focus only on
identifying bilingual synonym pairs and evaluating
the performance of the identification.
We employ a supervised machine learning tech-
nique with features related to spelling variations
and so on. Figure 3 shows the framework for this
method. At first we prepare a bilingual lexicon with
synonymous information as training data, and gen-
erate a list consisting of all bilingual lexical item
Figure 3: Overview of our framework
pairs in the bilingual lexicon. The presence or ab-
sence of bilingual synonymous relations is attached
to each element of the list. Then, we build a classi-
fier learned by training data, using a maximum en-
tropy model (Berger et al, 1996) and the features
related to spelling variations in Table 3.
We apply some preprocessings for extracting
some features. For English, we transform all terms
into lower-case, and do not apply any other trans-
formations such as tokenization by symbols. For
Japanese, we apply a morphological analyzer JU-
MAN (Kurohashi et al, 1994) and obtain hiragana
representations5 as much as possible6. We may re-
quire other language-specific preprocessings for ap-
plying this method to other languages.
We employed binary or real-valued features de-
scribed in Table 3. Moreover, we introduce
the following combinatorial features: h1F ? h1E ,?
h2F ? h2E ,
?
h3F ? h3E , h5E ? h5F , h6 ? h2F and
h7 ? h2E .
3.2.1 Two approaches for identifying bilingual
synonym pairs
There are two approaches for identifying bilin-
gual synonym pairs: one is directly identifying
whether two bilingual lexical items are bilingual
synonyms (?bilingual? method), and another is first
5Hiragana is one of normalized representations of Japanese
terms, which denotes how to pronounce the term. Japanese vo-
cabulary has many of homonyms, which are semantically differ-
ent but have the same pronunciation. Despite the risk of classi-
fying homonyms into synonyms, we do not use original forms
of Japanese terms because they are typically too short to extract
character similarities.

identifying monolingual synonyms in each language
and then merging them according to the bilingual
items (?monolingual? method). We implement these
two approaches and compare the results. For identi-
fying monolingual synonyms, we use features with
bilingual items as follows: For a term pair e1 and
e2, we obtain all the translation candidates F1 =
{f |(f, e1) ? D} and F2 = {f ?|(f ?, e2) ? D},
and calculate feature values related to F1 and/or F2
by obtaining the maximum feature value using F1
and/or F2. After that, if all the following four con-
ditions (p1 = (f1, e1) ? D, p2 = (f2, e2) ? D,
f1 ? e1 and f2 ? e2) are satisfied, we assume that
p1 and p2 are bilingual synonym pairs7.

onym if the Japanese terms and the English terms
are synonymous. The baseline represents the per-

tions, and the upper bound shows the limitation of
the monolingual approach.

many kinds of lexicons.
To investigate the effectiveness of each feature,
we compared the scores when we remove several
features. Table 7 shows these results. Contrary to
our intuition, we found that features of agreement
of the first characters (h1) remarkably degraded the
recall without gains in precision. One of the rea-
sons for such results is that there are many cases
of non-synonyms that have the same first character.
We need to investigate more effective combinations
of features or to apply other machine learning tech-
niques for improving the performance. From these
results, we consider that the features of h4 are effec-
tive for improving the recall, and that the features of
h2 and h5 contribute improvement of both the pre-
cision and the recall. h3, h6, h7, and combinatorial
features seem to improve the recall at the expense
of precision. Which measure is important depends
on the importance of our target for using this tech-
nique. It depends on the requirements that we em-
phasize, but in general the recall is more important
for finding more bilingual synonyms.
5 Conclusion and future work
This paper proposed a method for identifying bilin-
gual synonyms in a bilingual lexicon by using clues
of spelling variations. We described the notion of
bilingual synonyms, and presented two approaches
for identifying them: one is to directly predict the
relation, and another is to merge monolingual syn-
onyms identified, according to the bilingual lexicon.
Our experiments showed that the proposed method
significantly outperformed the method that did not
use features primarily with spelling variations; the
proposed method extracted bilingual synonyms with
high precision and recall. In addition, we found that
merging monolingual synonyms by the dictionary is
effective for finding bilingual synonyms; there oc-
cur few errors through the assumption described in
Section 3.2.1.
Our future work contains implementing more fea-
tures for identifying synonymous relations, con-
structing bilingual synonym sets, and evaluating our
method for specific tasks such as thesaurus construc-
tion or cross-lingual information retrieval.
Currently, the features used do not include other
clues with spelling variations, such as the weighted
edit distance, transformation patterns, stemming and
so on. Another important clue is distributional infor-
mation, such as the context. We can use both mono-
lingual and bilingual corpora for extracting distribu-
tions of terms, and bilingual corpora are expected to
be especially effective for our goal.
We did not perform an experiment to construct
bilingual synonym sets from synonym pairs in this
paper. Described in Section 3.1, bilingual syn-
onym sets can be constructed from bilingual syn-
onym pairs by assuming some approximations. The
approximation that permits transitivity of bilingual
synonymous relations increases identified bilingual
synonyms, and thus causes an increase in recall and
decrease in precision. It is an open problem to find
appropriate strategies for constructing bilingual syn-
onym sets.
Finally, we plan to evaluate our method for spe-
cific tasks. For data-driven machine translation, it is
expected that data sparseness problem is alleviated
by merging the occurrences of low-frequency terms.
Another application is cross-lingual information re-
trieval, which can be improved by using candidate
expanded queries from bilingual synonym sets.
