Abstract
Today, automatic evaluation metrics such as
ROUGE have become the de-facto mode of
evaluating an automatic summarization sys-
tem. However, based on the DUC and the TAC
evaluation results, (Conroy and Schlesinger,
2008; Dang and Owczarzak, 2008) showed
that the performance gap between human-
generated summaries and system-generated
summaries is clearly visible in manual eval-
uations but is often not reflected in automated
evaluations using ROUGE scores. In this pa-
per, we present our own experiments in com-
paring the results of manual evaluations ver-
sus automatic evaluations using our own text
summarizer: BlogSum. We have evaluated
BlogSum-generated summary content using
ROUGE and compared the results with the
original candidate list (OList). The t-test re-
sults showed that there is no significant differ-
ence between BlogSum-generated summaries
and OList summaries. However, two man-
ual evaluations for content using two different
datasets show that BlogSum performed signif-
icantly better than OList. A manual evaluation
of summary coherence also shows that Blog-
Sum performs significantly better than OList.
These results agree with previous work and
show the need for a better automated sum-
mary evaluation metric rather than the stan-
dard ROUGE metric.
1 Introduction
Today, any NLP task must be accompanied by a
well-accepted evaluation scheme. This is why, for
the last 15 years, to evaluate automated summariza-
tion systems, sets of evaluation data (corpora, topics,
. . . ) and baselines have been established in text sum-
marization competitions such as TREC1, DUC2, and
TAC3. Although evaluation is essential to verify the
quality of a summary or to compare different sum-
marization approaches, the evaluation criteria used
are by no means universally accepted (Das and Mar-
tins, 2007). Summary evaluation is a difficult task
because no ideal summary is available for a set of
input documents. In addition, it is also difficult to
compare different summaries and establish a base-
line because of the absence of standard human or
automatic summary evaluation metrics. On the other
hand, manual evaluation is very expensive. Accord-
ing to (Lin, 2004), large scale manual evaluations of
all participants? summaries in the DUC 2003 confer-
ence would require over 3000 hours of human efforts
to evaluate summary content and linguistic qualities.
The goal of this paper is to show that the literature
and our own work empirically point out the need for
a better automated summary evaluation metric rather
than the standard ROUGE metric4 (Lin, 2004).
2 Current Evaluation Schemes
The available summary evaluation techniques can
be divided into two categories: manual and auto-
matic. To do a manual evaluation, human experts as-
sess different qualities of the system generated sum-
maries. On the other hand, for an automatic eval-

uation, tools are used to compare the system gen-
erated summaries with human generated gold stan-
dard summaries or reference summaries. Although
they are faster to perform and result in consistent
evaluations, automatic evaluations can only address
superficial concepts such as n-grams matching, be-
cause many required qualities such as coherence and
grammaticality cannot be measured automatically.
As a result, human judges are often called for to
evaluate or cross check the quality of the summaries,
but in many cases human judges have different opin-
ions. Hence inter-annotator agreement is often com-
puted as well.
The quality of a summary is assessed mostly on its
content and linguistic quality (Louis and Nenkova,
2008). Content evaluation of a query-based sum-
mary is performed based on the relevance with the
topic and the question and the inclusion of important
contents from the input documents. The linguistic
quality of a summary is evaluated manually based on
how it structures and presents the contents. Mainly,
subjective evaluation is done to assess the linguis-
tic quality of an automatically generated summary.
Grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity,
focus, structure and coherence are commonly used
factors considered to evaluate the linguistic quality.
A study by (Das and Martins, 2007) shows that eval-
uating the content of a summary is more difficult
compared to evaluating its linguistic quality.
There exist different measures to evaluate an
output summary. The most commonly used metrics
are recall, precision, F-measure, Pyramid score,
and ROUGE/BE.
Automatic versus Manual Evaluation
Based on an analysis of the 2005-2007 DUC data,
(Conroy and Schlesinger, 2008) showed that the
ROUGE evaluation and a human evaluation can sig-
nificantly vary due to the fact that ROUGE ignores
linguistic quality of summaries, which has a huge in-
fluence in human evaluation. (Dang and Owczarzak,
2008) also pointed out that automatic evaluation is
rather different than the one based on manual assess-
ment. They explained this the following way: ?auto-
matic metrics, based on string matching, are unable
to appreciate a summary that uses different phrases
than the reference text, even if such a summary is
perfectly fine by human standards?.
To evaluate both opinionated and news article
based summarization approaches, previously men-
tioned evaluation metrics such as ROUGE or Pyra-
mid are used. Shared evaluation tasks such as
DUC and TAC competitions also use these methods
to evaluate participants? summary. Table 1 shows

the evaluation results of automatic systems? average
performance at the TAC 2008 to 2010 conferences
using the pyramid score (Pyr.) and responsiveness
(Resp.). In this evaluation, the pyramid score was
used to calculate the content relevance and the re-
sponsiveness of a summary was used to judge the
overall quality or usefulness of the summary, con-
sidering both the information content and linguistic
quality. These two criteria were evaluated manually.
The pyramid score was calculated out of 1 and the
responsiveness measures were calculated on a scale
of 1 to 5 (1, being the worst). However, in 2009,
responsiveness was calculated on a scale of 10. Ta-
ble 1 also shows a comparison between automatic
systems and human participants (model). In Table
1, the first 3 rows show the evaluation results of the
TAC Update Summarization (Upd.) initial summary
generation task (which were generated for news arti-
cles) and the last row shows the evaluation results of
the TAC 2008 Opinion Summarization track (Opi.)
where summaries were generated from blogs. From
Table 1, we can see that in both criteria, automatic
systems are weaker than humans. (Note that in the
table, Unk. refers to unknown.)
Interestingly, in an automatic evaluation, often,
not only is there no significant gap between models
and systems, but in many cases, automatic systems
scored higher than some human models.
Table 2 shows the performance of human (H.)
and automated systems (S.) (participants) using au-
tomated and manual evaluation in the TAC 2008 up-

responsiveness, respectively. A t-test of statistical
significance applied to the data in Table 2 shows that
there is no significant difference between human and
participants in automated evaluation but that there is
a significant performance difference between them
in the manual evaluation.
These findings indicate that ROUGE is not the
most effective tool to evaluate summaries. Our own
experiments described below arrive at the same con-
clusion.
3 BlogSum
We have designed an extractive query-based summ-
rizer called BlogSum. In BlogSum, we have devel-
oped our own sentence extractor to retrieve the ini-
tial list of candidate sentences (we called it OList)
based on question similarity, topic similarity, and
subjectivity scores. Given a set of initial candidate
sentences, BlogSum generates summaries using dis-
course relations within a schema-based framework.
Details of BlogSum is outside the scope of this pa-
per. For details, please see (Mithun and Kosseim,
2011).
4 Evaluation of BlogSum
BlogSum-generated summaries have been evaluated
for content and linguistic quality, specifically dis-
course coherence. The evaluation of the content was
done both automatically and manually and the evalu-
ation of the coherence was done manually. Our eval-
uation results also reflect the discrepancy between
automatic and manual evaluation schemes of sum-
maries described above.
In our evaluation, BlogSum-generated summaries
were compared with the original candidate list gen-
erated by our approach without the discourse re-
ordering (OList). However, we have validated our
original candidate list with a publicly available sen-
tence ranker. Specifically, we have conducted an ex-
periment to verify whether MEAD-generated sum-
maries (Radev et al., 2004), a widely used publicly
available summarizer5, were better than our candi-
date list (OList). In this evaluation, we have gener-
ated summaries using MEAD with centroid, query
title, and query narrative features. In MEAD, query
title and query narrative features are implemented
using cosine similarity based on the tf-idf value. In
this evaluation, we used the TAC 2008 opinion sum-
marization dataset (described later in this section)
and summaries were evaluated using the ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-SU4 scores. Table 3 shows the results
of the automatic evaluation using ROUGE based on
summary content.
Table 3: Automatic Evaluation of MEAD based on Sum-
mary Content on TAC 2008
System R-2 (F) R-SU4 (F)
MEAD 0.0407 0.0642
Average 0.0690 0.0860
OList 0.1020 0.1070
Table 3 shows that MEAD-generated summaries
achieved weaker ROUGE scores compared to that
of our candidate list (OList). The table also shows
that MEAD performs weaker than the average per-
formance of the participants of TAC 2008 (Average).
We suspect that these poor results are due to sev-
eral reasons. First, in MEAD, we cannot use opin-
ionated terms or polarity information as a sentence
selection feature. On the other hand, most of the
summarizers, which deal with opinionated texts, use
opinionated terms and polarity information for this
purpose. In addition, in this experiment, for some of
the TAC 2008 questions, MEAD was unable to cre-
ate any summary. This evaluation results prompted
us to develop our own candidate sentence selector.

4.1 Evaluation of Content
4.1.1 Automatic Evaluation of Content
First, we have automatically evaluated the sum-
maries generated by our approach for content. As
a baseline, we used the original ranked list of can-
didate sentences (OList), and compared them to the
final summaries (BlogSum). We have used the data
from the TAC 2008 opinion summarization track for
the evaluation.
The dataset consists of 50 questions on 28 topics;
on each topic one or two questions are asked and 9 to
39 relevant documents are given. For each question,
one summary was generated by OList and one by
BlogSum and the maximum summary length was re-
stricted to 250 words. This length was chosen cause
in the DUC conference from 2005 to 2007, in the
main summarization task, the summary length was
250 words. In addition, (Conroy and Schlesinger,
2008) also created summaries of length 250 words
in their participation in the TAC 2008 opinion sum-
marization task and performed well. (Conroy and
Schlesinger, 2008) also pointed out that if the sum-
maries were too long this adversely affected their
scores. Moreover, according to the same authors
shorter summaries are easier to read. Based on these
observations, we have restricted the maximum sum-
mary length to 250 words. However, in the TAC
2008 opinion summarization track, the allowable
summary length is very long (the number of non-
whitespace characters in the summary must not ex-
ceed 7000 times the number of questions for the tar-
get of the summary). In this experiment, we used
the ROUGE metric using answer nuggets (provided
by TAC), which had been created to evaluate par-
ticipants? summaries at TAC, as gold standard sum-
maries. F-scores are calculated for BlogSum and
OList using ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4. In this
experiment, ROUGE scores are also calculated for
all 36 submissions in the TAC 2008 opinion sum-
marization track.
The evaluation results are shown in Table 4. Note
that in the table Rank refers to the rank of the system
compared to the other 36 systems.
Table 4 shows that BlogSum achieved a better F-
Measure (F) for ROUGE-2 (R-2) and ROUGE-SU4
(R-SU4) compared to OList. From the results, we
can see that BlogSum gained 18% and 16% in F-

Average 0.069 0.086 N/A
Measure over OList using ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-
SU4, respectively.
Compared to the other systems that participated to
the TAC 2008 opinion summarization track, Blog-
Sum performed very competitively; it ranked third
and its F-Measure score difference from the best sys-
tem is very small. Both BlogSum and OList per-
formed better than the average systems.
However, a further analysis of the results of
Table 4 shows that there is no significant differ-
ence between BlogSum-generated summaries and
OList summaries using the t-test with a p-value
of 0.228 and 0.464 for ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-
SU4, respectively. This is inline with (Conroy and
Schlesinger, 2008; Dang and Owczarzak, 2008) who
showed that the performance gap between human-
generated summaries and system-generated sum-
maries at DUC and TAC is clearly visible in a man-
ual evaluation, but is often not reflected in automated
evaluations using ROUGE scores. Based on these
findings, we suspected that there might be a perfor-
mance difference between BlogSum-generated sum-
maries and OList which is not reflected in ROUGE
scores. To verify our suspicion, we have conducted
manual evaluations for content.
4.1.2 Manual Evaluation of Content using the
Blog Dataset
We have conducted two manual evaluations using
two different datasets to better quantify BlogSum-
generated summary content.
Corpora and Experimental Design
In the first evaluation, we have again used the TAC
2008 opinion summarization track data. For each
question, one summary was generated by OList and
one by BlogSum and the maximum summary length
was again restricted to 250 words. To evaluate
47
content, 3 participants manually rated 50 summaries
from OList and 50 summaries from BlogSum using
a blind evaluation. These summaries were rated
on a likert scale of 1 to 5 where 1 refers to ?very
poor? and 5 refers to ?very good?. Evaluators rated
each summary with respect to the question for
which it was generated and against the reference
summary. In this experiment, we have used the
answer nuggets provided by TAC as the reference
summary, which had been created to evaluate
participants? summaries at TAC. Annotators were
asked to evaluate summaries based on their content
without considering their linguistic qualities.
Results
In this evaluation, we have calculated the average
scores of all 3 annotators? ratings to a particular
question to compute the score of BlogSum for a
particular question. Table 5 shows the performance
comparison between BlogSum and OList. The re-
sults show that 58% of the time BlogSum summaries
were rated better than OList summaries which im-
plies that 58% of the time, our approach has im-
proved the question relevance compared to that of
the original candidate list (OList).

Manual Evaluation of Summary Content on TAC 2008
Comparison %
BlogSum Score > OList Score 58%
BlogSum Score = OList Score 30%

Table 6 shows the performance of BlogSum ver-
sus OList on each likert scale; where ? shows the
difference in performance. Table 6 demonstrates
that 52% of the times, BlogSum summaries were
rated as ?very good? or ?good?, 26% of the times
they were rated as ?barely acceptable? and 22% of
the times they were rated as ?poor? or ?very poor?.
From Table 6, we can also see that BlogSum out-
performed OList in the scale of ?very good? and
?good? by 8% and 22%, respectively; and improved
the performance in ?barely acceptable?, ?poor?, and
?very poor? categories by 12%, 8%, and 10%, re-
spectively.
In this evaluation, we have also calculated

whether there is any performance gap between Blog-
Sum and OList. The t-test results show that in a two-
tailed test, BlogSum performed significantly better
than OList with a p-value of 0.00281.
Whenever human performance is computed by
more than one person, it is important to compute
inter-annotator agreement. This ensures that the
agreement between annotators did not simply occur
by chance. In this experiment, we have also cal-
culated the inter-annotator agreement using Cohen?s
kappa coefficient to verify the annotation subjectiv-
ity. We have found that the average pair-wise inter-
annotator agreement is moderate according to (Lan-
dis and Koch, 1977) with the kappa-value of 0.58.
4.1.3 Manual Evaluation of Content using the
Review Dataset
We have conducted a second evaluation using
the OpinRank dataset6 and (Jindal and Liu, 2008)?s
dataset to evaluate BlogSum-generated summary
content.
Corpora and Experimental Design
In this second evaluation, we have used a subset of
the OpinRank dataset and (Jindal and Liu, 2008)?s
dataset. The OpinRank dataset contains reviews on
cars and hotels collected from Tripadvisor (about
259,000 reviews) and Edmunds (about 42,230 re-
views). The OpinRank dataset contains 42,230 re-
views on cars for different model-years and 259,000
reviews on different hotels in 10 different cities. For
this dataset, we created a total of 21 questions in-
cluding 12 reason questions and 9 suggestions. For
each question, 1500 to 2500 reviews were provided
6OpinRank Dataset: http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-
ranking-data
48
as input documents to create the summary.
(Jindal and Liu, 2008)?s dataset consists of 905
comparison and 4985 non-comparison sentences.
Four human annotators labeled these data manually.
This dataset consists of reviews, forum, and news ar-
ticles on different topics from different sources. We
have created 9 comparison questions for this dataset.
For each question, 700 to 1900 reviews were pro-
vided as input documents to create the summary.
For each question, one summary was generated
by OList and one by BlogSum and the maximum
summary length was restricted to 250 words again.
To evaluate question relevance, 3 participants
manually rated 30 summaries from OList and 30
summaries from BlogSum using a blind evaluation.
These summaries were again rated on a likert scale
of 1 to 5. Evaluators rated each summary with
respect to the question for which it was generated.
Results
Table 7 shows the performance comparison between
BlogSum and OList. The results show that 67% of
the time BlogSum summaries were rated better than
OList summaries. The table also shows that 30%
of the time both approaches performed equally well
and 3% of the time BlogSum was weaker than OList.

Table 8 demonstrates that 44% of the time Blog-
Sum summaries were rated as ?very good?, 33% of
the time rated as ?good?, 13% of the time they were
rated as ?barely acceptable? and 10% of the time
they were rated as ?poor? or ?very poor?. From Ta-
ble 8, we can also see that BlogSum outperformed
OList in the scale of ?very good? by 34% and im-
proved the performance in ?poor? and ?very poor?
categories by 23% and 10%, respectively.
In this evaluation, we have also calculated
whether there is any performance gap between Blog-

Sum and OList. The t-test results show that in a two-
tailed test, BlogSum performed significantly very
better than OList with a p-value of 0.00236. In ad-
dition, the average pair-wise inter-annotator agree-
ment is substantial according to (Landis and Koch,
1977) with the kappa-value of 0.77.
4.1.4 Analysis
In both manual evaluation for content, BlogSum
performed significantly better than OList. We can
see that even though there was not any signifi-
cant performance gap between BlogSum and OList-
generated summaries in the automatic evaluation of
Section 4.1.1, both manual evaluations show that
BlogSum and OList-generated summaries signifi-
cantly vary at the content level. For content, our re-
sults support (Conroy and Schlesinger, 2008; Dang
and Owczarzak, 2008)?s findings and points out for
a better automated summary evaluation tool.
4.2 Evaluation of Linguistic Quality
Our next experiments were geared at evaluating the
linguistic quality of our summaries.
4.2.1 Automatic Evaluation of Linguistic
Quality
To test the linguistic qualities, we did not use
an automatic evaluation because (Blair-Goldensohn
and McKeown, 2006) found that the ordering of con-
tent within the summaries is an aspect which is not
evaluated by ROUGE. Moreover, in the TAC 2008
opinion summarization track, on each topic, answer
snippets were provided which had been used as sum-
marization content units (SCUs) in pyramid evalua-
tion to evaluate TAC 2008 participants summaries
but no complete summaries is provided to which we
can compare BlogSum-generated summaries for co-
49
herence. As a result, we only performed two man-
ual evaluations using two different datasets again to
see whether BlogSum performs significantly better
than OList for linguistic qualities too. The pos-
itive results of the next experiments will ensure
that BlogSum-generated summaries are really sig-
nificantly better than OList summaries.
4.2.2 Manual Evaluation of Discourse
Coherence using the Blog Dataset
In this evaluation, we have again used the TAC
2008 opinion summarization track data. For each
question, one summary was generated by OList and
one by BlogSum and the maximum summary length
was restricted to 250 words again. Four participants
manually rated 50 summaries from OList and 50
summaries from BlogSum for coherence. These
summaries were again rated on a likert scale of 1 to
5.
Results
To compute the score of BlogSum for a particular
question, we calculated the average scores of all an-
notators? ratings to that question. Table 9 shows
the performance comparison between BlogSum and
OList. We can see that 52% of the time BlogSum
Table 9: Comparison of OList and BlogSum based on the
Manual Evaluation of Discourse Coherence on TAC 2008
Comparison %
BlogSum Score > OList Score 52%
BlogSum Score = OList Score 30%
BlogSum Score < OList Score 18%
summaries were rated better than OList summaries;
30% of the time both performed equally well; and
18% of the time BlogSum was weaker than OList.
This means that 52% of the time, our approach has
improved the coherence compared to that of the
original candidate list (OList).
From Table 10, we can see that BlogSum outper-
formed OList in the scale of ?very good? and ?good?
by 16% and 8%, respectively; and improved the per-
formance in ?barely acceptable? and ?poor? cate-
gories by 12% and 14%, respectively.
The t-test results show that in a two-tailed test,
BlogSum performed significantly better than OList

with a p-value of 0.0223. In addition, the average
pair-wise inter-annotator agreement is substantial
according to with the kappa-value of 0.76.
4.2.3 Manual Evaluation of Discourse
Coherence using the Review Dataset
In this evaluation, we have again used the Opin-
Rank dataset and (Jindal and Liu, 2008)?s dataset
to conduct the second evaluation of content. In
this evaluation, for each question, one summary
was generated by OList and one by BlogSum and
the maximum summary length was restricted to
250 words. Three participants manually rated 30
summaries from OList and 30 summaries from
BlogSum for coherence.
Results
To compute the score of BlogSum for a particular
question, we calculated the average scores of all an-
notators? ratings to that question. Table 11 shows
the performance comparison between BlogSum and
OList. We can see that 57% of the time BlogSum

summaries were rated better than OList summaries;

23% of the time BlogSum was weaker than OList.

From Table 12, we can see that BlogSum outper-
formed OList in the scale of ?very good? and ?good?
by 10% and 16%, respectively; and improved the
performance in ?barely acceptable? and ?very poor?
categories by 10% and 16%, respectively.
We have also evaluated if the difference in perfor-
mance between BlogSum and OList was statistically
significant. The t-test results show that in a two-
tailed test, BlogSum performed significantly better
than OList with a p-value of 0.0371.
In this experiment, we also calculated the inter-
annotator agreement using Cohen?s kappa coeffi-
cient. We have found that the average pair-wise
inter-annotator agreement is substantial according to
(Landis and Koch, 1977) with the kappa-value of
0.74.
The results of both manual evaluations of dis-
course coherence also show that BlogSum performs
significantly better than OList.
5 Conclusion
Based on the DUC and TAC evaluation re-
sults, (Conroy and Schlesinger, 2008; Dang and
Owczarzak, 2008) showed that the performance gap
between human-generated summaries and system-
generated summaries, which is clearly visible in the
manual evaluation, is often not reflected in auto-
mated evaluations using ROUGE scores. In our
content evaluation, we have used the automated
measure ROUGE (ROUGE-2 & ROUGE-SU4) and
the t-test results showed that there was no signif-
icant difference between BlogSum-generated sum-
maries and OList summaries with a p-value of 0.228
and 0.464 for ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4, respec-
tively. We suspected that there might be a perfor-
mance difference between BlogSum-generated sum-
maries and OList which is not reflected in ROUGE
scores. To verify our suspicion, we have conducted
two manual evaluations for content using two dif-
ferent datasets. The t-test results for both datasets
show that in a two-tailed test, BlogSum performed
significantly better than OList with a p-value of
0.00281 and 0.00236. Manual evaluations of co-
herence also show that BlogSum performs signifi-
cantly better than OList. Even though there was no
significant performance gap between BlogSum and
OList-generated summaries in the automatic evalua-
tion, the manual evaluation results clearly show that
BlogSum-generated summaries are better than OList
significantly. Our results supports (Conroy and
Schlesinger, 2008; Dang and Owczarzak, 2008)?s
findings and points out for a better automated sum-
mary evaluation tool.
