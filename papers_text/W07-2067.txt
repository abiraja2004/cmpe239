Abstract
In this paper, we describe our two SemEval-
2007 entries. Our first entry, for Task 5:
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sam-
ple Task, is a supervised system that decides
the most appropriate English translation of
a Chinese target word. This system uses a
combination of Na??ve Bayes, nearest neigh-
bor cosine, decision lists, and latent seman-
tic analysis. Our second entry, for Task 14:
Affective Text, is a supervised system that
annotates headlines using a predefined list of
emotions. This system uses synonym expan-
sion and matches lemmatized unigrams in
the test headlines against a corpus of hand-
annotated headlines.
1 Introduction
This paper describes our two entries in SemEval-
2007. The first entry, a supervised system used in the
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample task
(Task 5), is an extension of the system described in
(Wicentowski et al, 2004). We implement five dif-
ferent classifiers: a Na??ve Bayes classifier, a decision
list classifier, two different nearest neighbor cosine
classifiers, and a classifier based on Latent Seman-
tic Analysis. Section 2.2 describes each of the in-
dividual classifiers, Section 2.3 describes our clas-
sifier combination system, and Section 2.4 presents
our results.
The second entry, a supervised system used in the
Affective Text task (Task 14), uses a corpus of head-
lines hand-annotated by non-experts. It also uses an
online thesaurus to match synonyms and antonyms
of the sense labels (Thesaurus.com, 2007). Section
3.1 describes the creation of the annotated training
corpus, Section 3.2 describes our method for assign-
ing scores to the headlines, and Section 3.3 presents
our results.
2 Task 5: Multilingual Chinese-English LS
This task presents a single Chinese word in context
which must be disambiguated. Rather than asking
participants to provide a sense label corresponding
to a pre-defined sense inventory, the goal here is to
label each ambiguous word with its correct English
translation. Since the task is quite similar to more
traditional lexical sample tasks, we extend an ap-
proach used successfully in multiple Senseval-3 lex-
ical sample tasks (Wicentowski et al, 2004).
2.1 Features
Each of our classifiers uses the same set of context
features, taken directly from the data provided by the
task organizers. The features we used included:
? Bag-of-words (unigrams)
? Bigrams and trigrams around the target word
? Weighted unigrams surrounding the target
word
The weighted unigram features increased the fre-
quencies of the ten words before and after the tar-
get word by inserting them multiple times into the
bag-of-words.
308
Many words in the Chinese data were broken up
into ?subwords?: since we were unsure how to han-
dle these and since their appearance seemed incon-
sistent, we decided to simply treat each subword as a
word for the purposes of creating bigrams, trigrams,
and weighted unigrams.
2.2 Classifiers
Our system consists of five unique classifiers. Three
of the classifiers were selected by our combination
system, while the other two were found to be detri-
mental to its performance. We describe the con-
tributing classifiers first. Table 1 shows the results
of each classifier, as well as our classifier combina-
tion system.
2.2.1 Na??ve Bayes
The Na??ve Bayes classifier is based on Bayes? the-
orem, which allows us to define the similarity be-
tween an instance, I, and a sense class, Sj , as:
Sim(I, Sj) = Pr(I, Sj) = Pr(Sj) ? Pr(I|Sj)
We then choose the sense with the maximum sim-
ilarity to the test instance.
Additive Smoothing
Additive smoothing is a technique that is used
to attempt to improve the information gained from
low-frequency words, in tasks such as speech pat-
tern recognition (Chen and Goodman, 1998). We
used additive smoothing in the Na??ve Bayes classi-
fier. To implement additive smoothing, we added a
very small number, ?, to the frequency count of each
feature (and divided the final product by this ? value
times the size of the feature set to maintain accurate
probabilities). This small number has almost no ef-
fect on more frequent words, but boosts the score
of less common, yet potentially equally informative,
words.
2.2.2 Decision List
The decision list classifier uses the log-likelihood
of correspondence between each context feature and
each sense, using additive smoothing (Yarowsky,
1994). The decision list was created by ordering
the correspondences from strongest to weakest. In-
stances that did not match any rule in the decision
list were assigned the most frequent sense, as calcu-
lated from the training data.
2.2.3 Nearest Neighbor Cosine
The nearest neighbor cosine classifier required the
creation of a term-document matrix, which contains
a row for each training instance of an ambiguous
word, and a column for each feature that can occur
in the context of an ambiguous word. The rows of
this matrix are referred to as sense vectors because
each row represents a combination of the features of
all ambiguous words that share the same sense.
The nearest neighbor cosine classifier compares
each of the training vectors to each ambiguous in-
stance vector. The cosine between the ambiguous
vector and each of the sense vectors is calculated,
and the sense that is the ?nearest? (largest cosine, or
smallest angle) is selected by the classifier.
TF-IDF
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Fre-
quency) is a method for automatically adjusting the
frequency of words based on their semantic impor-
tance to a document in a corpus. TF-IDF decreases
the value of words that occur in more different doc-
uments. The equation we used for TF-IDF is:
tfi ? idfi = ni ? log
( |D|
|D : ti?D|
)
where ni is the number of occurrences of a term ti,
and D is the set of all training documents.
TF-IDF is used in an attempt to minimize the
noise from words such as ?and? that are extremely
common, but, since they are common across all
training instances, carry little semantic content.
2.2.4 Non-contributing Classifiers
We implemented a classifier based on Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (Landauer et al, 1998). To do
the calculations required for LSA, we used the
SVDLIBC library1. Because this classifier actu-
ally weakened our combination system (in cross-
validation), our classifier combination (Section 2.3)
does not include it.
We also implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors clas-
sifier, which treats each individual training instance
1http://tedlab.mit.edu/?dr/SVDLIBC/
309
as a separate vector (instead of treating each set of
training instances that makes up a given sense as a
single vector), and finds the k-nearest training in-
stances to the test instance. The most frequent sense
among the k-nearest to the test instance is the se-
lected sense. Unfortunately, the k-NN classifier did
not improve the results of our combined system and
so it is not included in our classifier combination.
2.3 Classifier Combination
The classifier combination algorithm that we imple-
ment is based on a simple voting system. Each clas-
sifier returns a score for each sense: the Na??ve Bayes
classifier returns a probability, the cosine-based clas-
sifiers (including LSA) return a cosine distance, and
the decision list classifier returns the weight asso-
ciated with the chosen feature (if no feature is se-
lected, the frequency of the most frequent sense is
used). The scores from each classifier are normal-
ized to the range [0,1], multiplied by an empirically
determined weight for that classifier, and summed
for each sense. The combiner then chooses the sense
with the highest score. We used cross validation to
determine the weight for each classifier, and it was
during that test that we discovered that the best con-
stant for the LSA and k-NN classifiers was zero. The
most likely explanation for this is that the LSA and
k-NN are doing similar, only less accurate, classi-
fications as the nearest neighbor classifier, and so
have little new knowledge to add to the combiner.
We also implemented a simple majority voting sys-
tem, where the chosen sense is the sense chosen by
the most classifiers, but found it to be less accurate.
2.4 Evaluation
To increase the accuracy of our system, we needed to
optimize various parameters by running the training
data through 10-way cross-validation and averaging
the scores from each set. Table 2 shows the results of
this cross-validation in determining the ? value used
in the additive smoothing for both the Na??ve Bayes
classifier and for the decision list classifier.
We also experimented with different feature sets.
The results of these experiments are shown in Ta-
ble 3.

2.5 Conclusion
We presented a supervised system that used simple
n-gram features and a combination of five different
classifiers. The methods used are applicable to any
lexical sample task, and have been applied to lexical
sample tasks in previous Senseval competitions.
3 Task 14
The goal of Task 14: Affective Text is to take a list of
headlines and meaningfully annotate their emotional
content. Each headline was scored along seven axes:
six predefined emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy,
Sadness, and Surprise) on a scale from 0 to 100, and
the negative/positive polarity (valence) of the head-
line on a scale from ?100 to +100.

words in addition to the feature listed.
3.1 Training Data Collection
Our system is trained on a set of pre-annotated head-
lines, building up a knowledge-base of individual
words and their emotional significance.
We were initially provided with a trial-set of 250
annotated headlines. We ran 5-way cross-validation
with a preliminary version of our system, and found
that a dataset of that size was too sparse to effec-
tively tag new headlines. In order to generate a
more meaningful knowledge-base, we created a sim-
ple web interface for human annotation of headlines.
We used untrained, non-experts to annotate an addi-
tional 1,000 headlines for use as a training set. The
headlines were taken from a randomized collection
of headlines from the Associated Press.
We included a subset of the original test set in
the set that we put online so that we could get a
rough estimate of the consistency of human annota-
tion. We found that consistency varied greatly across
the emotions. As can be seen in Table 4, our annota-
tors were very consistent with the trial data annota-
tors on some emotions, while inconsistent on others.
In ad-hoc, post-annotation interviews, our anno-
tators commented that the task was very difficult.
What we had initially expected to be a tedious but
mindless exercise turned out to be rather involved.
They also reported that some emotions were consis-
tently harder to annotate than others. The results in
Table 4 seem to bear this out as well.
Emotion Correlation
Valence 0.83
Sadness 0.81
Joy 0.79
Disgust 0.38
Anger 0.32
Fear 0.19
Surprise 0.19
Table 4: Pearson correlations between trial data an-
notators and our human annotators.
One difficulty reported by our annotators was de-
termining whether to label the emotion experienced
by the reader or by the subject of the headline. For
example, the headline ?White House surprised at
reaction to attorney firings? clearly states that the
White House was surprised, but the reader might not
have been.
Another of the major difficulties in properly an-
notating headlines is that many headlines can be an-
notated in vastly different ways depending on the
viewpoint of the annotator. For example, while the
headline ?Hundreds killed in earthquake? would be
universally accepted as negative, the headline ?Italy
defeats France in World Cup Final,? can be seen as
positive, negative, or even neutral depending on the
viewpoint of the reader. These types of problems
made it very difficult for our annotators to provide
consistent labels.
3.2 Data Processing
Before we can process a headline and determine its
emotions and valence, we convert our list of tagged
headlines into a useful knowledge base. To this end,
we create a word-emotion mapping.
3.2.1 Pre-processing
The first step is to lemmatize every word in every
headline, in an attempt to reduce the sparseness of
our data. We use the CELEX2 (Baayen et al, 1996)
data to perform this lemmatization. There are unfor-
tunate cases where lemmatizing actually changes the
emotional content of a word (unfortunate becomes
fortunate), but without lemmatization, our data is
simply too sparse to be of any use. Once we have
our list of lemmatized words, we score the emotions
and valence of each word as the average of the emo-
311
tions and valence of every headline, H, in which that
word, w, appears, ignoring non-content words:
Score(Em,w) =
?
H: w ? H
Score(Em,H)
In the final step of pre-processing, we add the
synonyms and antonyms of the sense labels them-
selves to our word-emotion mapping. We queried
the web interface for Roget?s New Millennium The-
saurus (Thesaurus.com, 2007) and added every word
in the first 8 entries for each sense label to our map,
with a score of 100 (the maximum possible score)
for that sense. We also added every word in the first
4 antonym entries with a score of ?40. For exam-
ple, for the emotion Joy, we added alleviation and
amusement with a score of 100, and we added de-
spair and misery with a score of ?40.
3.2.2 Processing
After creating our word-emotion mapping, pre-
dicting the emotions and valence of a given headline
is straightforward. We treat each headline as a bag-
of-words and lemmatize each word. Then we look
up each word in the headline in our word-emotion
map, and average the emotion and valence scores of
each word in our map that occurs in the headline.
We ignore words that were not present in the train-
ing data.
3.3 Evaluation
Emotion Training Size (Headlines)100 250 1000
Valence 19.07 32.07 35.25
Anger 8.42 13.38 24.51
Disgust 11.22 23.45 18.55
Fear 14.43 18.56 32.52
Joy 31.87 46.03 26.11
Sadness 16.32 35.09 38.98
Surprise 1.15 11.12 11.82
Table 5: A comparison of results on the provided
trial data as headlines are added to the training
set. The scores are given as Pearson correlations of
scores for training sets of size 100, 250, and 1000
headlines.
As can be seen in Table 5, four out of six emotions
and the valence increase along with training set size.
This leads us to believe that further increases in the
size of the training set would continue to improve
results. Lack of time prevents a full analysis that
can explain the sudden drop of Disgust and Joy.
Table 6 shows our full results from this task. Our
system finished third out of five in the valence sub-
task and second out of three in the emotion sub-task.

3.4 Conclusion
We presented a supervised system that used a un-
igram model to annotate the emotional content of
headlines. We also used synonym expansion on the
emotion label words. Our annotators encountered
significant difficulty while tagging training data, due
to ambiguity in definition of the task.
