ABSTRACT 
As multilingual products and technology grow in importance, 
the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) intends to provide 
the resources needed for research and development activities, 
especially in telephone-based, small-vocabulary ecognition 
applications; language identification research; and large vo- 
cabulary continuous peech recognition research. 
The POLYPHONE corpora, a multilingual "database of 
databases," are specifically designed to meet the needs of 
telephone application development and testing. Data sets 
from many of the world's commercially important languages 
will be available within the next few years. 
Language identification corpora will be large sets of spon- 
taneous telephone speech in several anguages with a wide 
variety of speakers, channels, and handsets. One corpus is 
now available, and current plans call for corpora of increas- 
ing size and complexity over the next few years. 
Large vocabulary speech recognition requires transcribed 
speech, pronouncing dictionaries, and language models. To 
fill this need, LDC will use the unattended computer- 
controlled collection methods developed for SWITCH- 
BOARD to create several similar corpora, each about one- 
tenth the size of SWITCHBOARD, in other languages. Text 
corpora sufficient to create useful language models will be 
collected and distributed as well. Finally, pronouncing dictio- 
naries covering the vocabulary of both transcripts and texts 
will be produced and made available. 
1. MULTILINGUAL DATABASES 
In its nearly two year history, LDC has assembled sub- 
stantial resources for linguistic research on English: more 
than a half billion words of text, many hundreds of hours 
of speech, syntactically tagged corpora, and the begin- 
nings of a multipurpose l xicon of English syntactic fea- 
tures, word senses and pronunciations. With one third 
of its members from outside the US, and with increasing 
interest everywhere in expanding the scope of linguis- 
tic technologies to other languages, LDC is increasingly 
called upon for resources in languages other than En- 
glish. 
Other papers in this session describe the efforts under 
way to secure large and useful bodies of text in other 
languages, and to develop lexicons or pronouncing dic- 
tionaries. This paper will focus on speech corpora, and 
for the most part on those which are expected to be 
available in the next year or two. 
1.1. Telephone applications 
This is currently the leading edge of commercial interest, 
because of the simplicity of most telephone applications, 
their large scale, and the international and multilingual 
nature of telecommunication systems. With the number 
of telephone companies and their vendors who belong to 
LDC, this is and promises to remain a high priority. The 
first offerings will be a series of data sets from an inter- 
national project known as POLYPHONE, in which LDC 
has played a leadership role. This multilingual "database 
of databases" is designed to meet the need for: 
? adequate training data for the most common tele- 
phone applications of Sit; 
? public evaluation data for each language; 
? cross-language comparabil ity of performance; 
? a legitimate testbed for language portability. 
Spec i f i cat ions  of  POLYPHONE databases .  The 
idea of a multinational, multilingual, distributed data 
collection project was first discussed at a meeting of 
the Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and 
Assessment (Cocosda) in October 1992. In addition to 
its obvious commercial value for developers of telephone 
speech recognition, such a database was thought to be 
"precompetitive," in the sense that it involves no new 
knowledge or advanced capabilities, and is designed more 
to support general technology research rather than prod- 
uct development. To make wide participation possible, 
the plan was to keep the cost of collection in the range 
of one or two dollars per utterance. 
In the ensuing months, prospective participants ought 
funding and exchanged e-mail, culminating in a meeting 
in April 1993 at ICASSP where a set of broad specifica- 
tions was proposed. Each POLYPHONE data set would 
23 
consist of 125,000 to 200,000 utterances, both read and 
spontaneous, recorded igitally and without human in- 
tervention from at least 5000 callers. The callers were to 
be drawn in roughly equal proportions from both sexes, 
from t\]hree categories of education, and from three or 
more age brackets. The utterances would include digits, 
strings of digits, spelled words, names of persons and 
places, plus a variety of application-oriented words. 
The exact content of the vocabulary in each language 
was lefl~ to the local projects and their sponsors, since 
they might wish to choose words or phrases for particu- 
lar word-based recognition applications such as banking, 
catalog shopping, speed dialing, etc. But every data set 
must also include several sentences or phrases by each 
caller which, in the ensemble and taken with the other 
read items, guarantee balanced phonetic overage of the 
language in terms of triphones. Sites may accomplish 
this by choosing material from well-known sets of pho- 
netically balanced sentences, by generating phonetically 
balanced phrases, or by selecting sentences from very 
large text collections by a procedure which optimizes 
phoneme, diphone, and/or triphone coverage. The se- 
lection criteria and phonetic statistics hould be docu- 
mented with each database. 
All utterances are to be audited and transcribed or- 
thographically; criteria and conventions have been sug- 
gested for accepting or rejecting utterances, and for 
marking unusual speech and nonspeech events, so that 
a degree of uniformity across datasets can be expected. 
Participants are encouraged to collect directly from dig- 
ital lines wherever possible, leaving the data in the origi- 
nal a-law or mu-law format. The goal is to have a collec- 
tion which is in some sense representative of the acoustics 
of the national telephone network, to minimize artifacts 
of collection, and to sample the population of potential 
users of telephone-based speech recognition applications. 
Thus a certain bias toward more affluent or educated 
users is specifically permitted. 
The American English contribution, collected for LDC at 
SRI International \[1\] and described in another paper in 
this session, will be the first POLYPHONE corpus to be 
published. Others are in various tages of development: 
of Prof. Dirk van Compernolle at Louvain Univer- 
sity in Belgium. If funded, this project will take 
advantage of the reusability of much of the Dutch 
material and software for that language. 
A Spanish version is now in progress at Texas In- 
struments (TI) in Dallas. The participants will 
be predominantly native speakers of Southwestern 
American Spanish. The collection platform is an In- 
terVoice Robotoperator, a commercial product with 
user modifiable software that interfaces to a T1 tele- 
phone line. Pilot data collection is complete, and 
full scale collection will begin soon. The project ti- 
tle, "Voice Across Hispanic America," harks back to 
the "Voice Across America" effort carried out at TI 
in 1989 \[2\], \[3\], which was, in many ways, the ances- 
tor of all these automated telephone data collection 
efforts. 
"Voice Across Japan," a project at the TI laborato- 
ries in Tsukuba, Japan, is also in progress \[4\]. The 
design and planning of this corpus predate POLY- 
PHONE, and thus there are differences in some pa- 
rameter choices - more speakers, fewer utterances 
per speaker, for example. Nevertheless, the result- 
ing database will be generally quite similar to the 
other POLYPHONE data sets, and TI has expressed 
willingness to release it through LDC. 
A Swiss French corpus is being collected under the 
direction of Prof. Gerard Chollet at the Institute 
Dalle Molle d'Intelligence Artificielle (IDIAP), with 
sponsorship from the Swiss national telephone com- 
pany. The platform will be similar to the one used 
in the Netherlands. 
The Italian telephone laboratory CSELT is also 
collecting a telephone speech corpus of which the 
POLYPHONE data will be a subset. Pilot data 
collection took place in December and January. 
The Taiwanese consortium SIGSLP, which includes 
the national telephone laboratories as a member, is 
committed to carrying out a POLYPI-IONE collec- 
tion in Mandarin, though funding was not received 
on the first try. 
? A Dutch version, co-sponsored by the Speech Ex- 
pertise Centre (SPEX) and the national telephone 
company and supervised by Prof. Louis Boves, is 
partly collected and being transcribed. The PC 
platform, telephone interface, and commercial ap- 
plication programming software used in this project 
cost less than $20,000. 
? A Flemish version is planned, under the supervision 
? Proposals are also under active consideration i  
other countries, including Denmark and Australia. 
? Sponsorship is being sought for German and for 
standard French. 
LDC may also sponsor collection of a separate 
POLYPI-IONE corpus from speakers of English as 
a second language. 
24 
To our current knowledge, the costs of collection were as 
predicted, but intellectual property rights were a serious 
concern. In some cases, LDC must still negotiate for the 
right to distribute the individual POLYPHONE corpora, 
but most of the sponsors eem willing to allow this, at 
least within a few months of completion of the project. 
Others may wish to distribute on their own terms. 
Each of these corpora, with transcriptions and sup- 
porting database tables and documentation, will occupy 
about 6 to 10 CD-ROMs; the 200,000 American English 
utterances, for example, average about 4 seconds per file 
(with some silence around each), so they will amount o 
about 6.4 Gbytes of (8-bit mu-law) sampled ata at 8 
kHz. Subsets of talkers will be marked for development 
and evaluation testing. 
1.2. Language Ident i f i ca t ion  Research  
In addition to government funded research, there is 
clearly a basis for commercial interest in this area, since 
a language ID algorithm can serve as a gateway to any 
other telephone-based application i  much the same way 
as speaker ID can. In order to be useful for language ID 
research, data must be gathered in such a way that selec- 
tions are otherwise indistinguishable by virtue of chan- 
nels, talkers, environmental variables, or other artifacts 
of collection. This means that most data sets collected 
for any other purpose will almost inevitably be inappro- 
priate, especially if each language comes from a different 
location, since even slight channel differences will betray 
the language. 
OGI corpus. The first publicly available data intended 
for language ID research is a collection of prompted tele- 
phone responses collected at the Oregon Graduate Insti- 
tute \[5\], now available from LDC. It contains peech in 
eleven languages from about 90 native speakers each. 
They were recorded at a single site in the US over con- 
ventional long distance telephone lines, using a PC, an 
A/D converter, and a telephone interface. 
The languages are English, Farsi, French, German, 
Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil, and Viet- 
namese. The speech is a mixture of brief responses to 
questions (e.g., days of the week) and short monologs (up 
to a minute) on unrestricted topics. Up to two minutes 
of speech was collected from each caller, and there are 
about 90 callers for each language. About ten percent 
of the calls are transcribed phonetically and aligned in 
time with the signal; the remainder have been audited 
to check for the contents, but not transcribed. 
The LDC version of the OGI Multilingual corpus on two 
CD-ROMs will have a suggested ivision by callers into 
training (50 callers), development test (20), and evalu- 
ation test (20) subsets for each language. This division 
is, in fact, being used by NIST in a government technol- 
ogy evaluation program. Future data of this type will be 
published as it becomes available. 
New Corpus in 1995 Another esource which will be 
useful for language ID is the CALL HOME corpus, de- 
scribed in more detail in the next section. CALL HOME 
data will resemble SWITCHBOARD in being sponta- 
neous two-way conversational speech with each side be- 
ing recorded separately. The calls will be between a- 
tive speakers of many languages besides English, and 
although all will be initiated from within the US, many 
will be international calls. Since country-specific chan- 
nel information might betray the language, the complete 
CALL HOME conversations will probably not be usable 
for language identification research. However, the do- 
mestic sides, i.e., at least half of each call, should be 
unbiased and thus appropriate for this purpose. 
1.3. Large  Vocabu lary  Speech  Recogn i -  
t ion  (LVSR)  
The issue of porting LVSR technology from one language 
to another is attracting increasing interest. For exam- 
ple, the SQALE project, recently begun in Europe, will 
apply the ARPA evaluation paradigm next year to three 
sites, each of which must develop speech recognition ca- 
pability in at least two languages. Not only is there 
much interest in the "portability" of speech recognition 
technology across languages, but there are also research 
systems which use the speech recognition "engine" for 
other more limited tasks whose dependence on language 
models is minimal, such as speaker ecognition, word 
spotting, and other applications. How language inde- 
pendent are these technologies? Only with comparable 
data across everal different languages can such issues be 
addressed. 
CALL HOME The CALL HOME corpus will con- 
sist of telephone conversations gathered somewhat in 
SWITCHBOARD style \[6\], that is: 
? automatically, with computer prompting but no hu- 
man intervention; 
? digitally, with no A/D conversion except at the 
speakers' locations; 
? fully duplex, with each side recorded separately; 
? from anywhere in the US, using an 800 number; 
? transcribed verbatim, at least up to 10 minutes; 
? time aligned between signal and transcript, at least 
at speakers' turns. 
25 
In contrast o SWITCHBOARD, the recordings will be: 
? unprompted as to topic; 
? international s well as domestic; 
? limited to one call per participant; 
? uncontrolled as to who is called; 
? up to 30 minutes in length. 
Within the next year, several hundreds of these calls 
will be recorded and transcribed in Mandarin, Japanese, 
Spanish, and English; hundreds more will be collected 
in other languages and used for language identification 
research as described in the last section. If the collection 
paradigm proves uccessful, transcription will go forward 
on these and other languages in following years. 
Text Col lections. To be widely useful, LVSR data 
sets must include not only speech and transcripts but a 
language model (or texts from which to construct one), 
and, in most cases, a pronouncing dictionary. The sim- 
plest, and in fact perhaps the only practicable means 
of providing the amount of text required to build useful 
language models in several different languages i to ac- 
quire newspaper or newswire texts in bulk. LDC plans to 
make available on CD-ROM, therefore, tens of millions of 
words in Japanese and Mandarin, and perhaps 100 mil- 
lion in Spanish. The majority of this will be acquired by 
daily spooling of newswire services. Apart from the use 
of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) 
for demarcation of the higher level units, details of the 
formats in which these texts will be distributed is still 
open for discussion. 
Lexicons. Pronouncing dictionaries will be produced 
for the main CALL HOME languages, i.e., those for 
which transcripts are produced. The current design calls 
for each lexicon to cover the pronunciation and part of 
speech of at least all the words used in the CALL HOME 
transcripts, the words in the text corpora used for lan- 
guage models, and any accidental gaps in the "core vo- 
cabulary" of the language after that. The definition of 
the "core," and any other information that might be 
provided, will depend on the language and on what re- 
source materials are available at the time the lexicon is 
developed. A more detailed description of this project 
is given in the companion paper in this session by Mark 
Liberman.
