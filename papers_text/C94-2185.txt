1 INTRODUCTION 
Reference resohttion is one of the important tasks in 
naturM l~mguage l)rocessing. I n Japanese newspaper 
articles, pronouns are not often used ~m referential 
expressions for COl'fll)ally ll0.11\]es~ \])lit shortelled (:()Ill- 
party names and doush.a ("the same eompany") are 
used more often (Murald et al 1993). Although there 
have beeo. studies of reference resolution Ib,' wmous 
aou. phrases in Japanese (Shibata el al. 1990; Kitani 
|994), except Kitani's work, they do not clearly show 
how to lind the referents in computa.tionally i)lausible 
ways for a large amount of data, suc, h as a newst)aper 
database. In this l)aper 1, we determilm the referents 
of dousha and their locations I)y hand, and then pro- 
pose one simph" and two heuristic methods which use 
SClllantic information in text ,';uc.h as collll)ally ilalllC8 
and their patterns, so as to I,est these three methods 
on how accurately they lind t.he correct referents. 
Dousha is f(mnd with several l)artich~s such as 
"\]~e", "ga", "*to", and "go" in neWSl)al)er artMes. 
Those which co-occur with ha and ga arc choseu for 
the data since they are l.hc. two most fre(luent parti- 
cles when dousha is in the sul)jeet position in a sen- 
tenc(:, q'ypically, ha marks the topic of the sentence 
and ga marks the subject of tim sellt(~l/(;e. A typical 
use of dousha is as follows:

2 LOCATIONS ANI) CONTEXTS 
OF THE tH~,Ii'ERENTS 
Most of the Japanese newspal)er articles e?amined 
in this study are in t.he domain of Joint-Ventures. 
The som'ees of lh<'. newspaper articles are mostly lhe 
Nikkci and the Ashahi. '\['h(! total number <)l" the ar- 
ticles is 1375, and there are 42 cases of dousha with 
ga amt 66 cases (>f dousha with ka in the entire set of 
articles. 
The followiug tables, Table 1 and Tabh'. 2, show 
the locations and contexts where the referents of both 
subsets of dousha appear.

Note for Table 1 and Table 2 
company name referred to is a part of a larger subject noun phrase. 
company name referred to comes at the end of tim 
sentence, a way of emphasising the company name in Japanese.

1,'or doush(~ with ga (Table 1), the referred coin- 
pany nan'les, mr the referents appear in non-sul/ject 
positions fi:om time to time, especially if the referent 
appears in the same sentence as dousha does. For 
dousha with ha (Table 2), compared with Table 1, 
very l>w referents are located in the same sentence, 
and most of the referents are in the subject position. 
For both occurrences of dousha, a considerable num- 
ber of the referellts appear two or more sentelice8 
beR)re, and a few of them show up even two or three 
paragraphs before. 
3 THREE HEURIST IC  METHODS 
TESTED 
3.1 Three  Heur i s t i c  Methods  
Oile simple and two heuristic iilethods to fill(I the rcl L 
erents of dousha are described below. The lirst, the 
simple method, is to take the closest COml/any name, 
(the one which appears most recently before dousha), 
as its referent (SilnI)le C losest  Method  or SCM).  
It is used ill this paper to indicate the t)~Lseline pcr- 
lbrmance tbr reference resolution of dousha. 
The second method is a modified Siml)le Closest 
Method for dousha with ca. It is basically the same 
as SCM except hat: 
? i f  there is (tile or there, conlpany l iaine hi the 
sairie seiltellce before the dousha, take |.lie clos- 
est COllipally nanw. as the referent. 
? if there is a conipany llaille inllnediately fol- 
lowed by ha, ca, deha, or niyorulo somewhere 
bel5re dousDa, use the closest such company 
name as the referent. 
? if the previous sentence nds with a cOral)any 
ll;_~llle, thus l )utt ing aii enlphasis on the COlll- 
pal ly liaine, make it the rcl\]2relit. 
? if there is a pattern "COli lpai ly l iame lie h l l l l ia l i  
l ialI le t i t le. . ."  (equivalent to <'title hi i l l la i i  l ialno 
of cOUll)any elaine..." in I'\]nglish) in the prove- 
Oils SOlltellce, then iiso the COllipaliy n~iliie as 
tim reforelit. Typ ica l  tit les are sh.achou (presi- 
dent) alld kaichou (Chairinan uP I/oard). 
The theM heuristic method is used t~r dousha with ha 
cases. It is also based on SCM except the following 
points: 
? if there is a company name innnediately tbL 
lowed by ha, ga, deha, or uiyoruto somewhere. 
before dousha, use the closest such colnl)any 
name as the referent. 
* if the previous sentence nds with a company 
name, thus putting an eniphasis Oil the coin- 
liany nalne, make it the reli'~rent. 
? if there is a pattern "coral)any nanie no human 
name title..." (equivalent to "title human name 
of company name..." in English) in the prove- 
mils seiltelice~ theil /ise the cowilialiy Ilanie as 
the refi;rent. 
The third method is in fact a set of the second 
method, and both of them use semantic information 
(i.e. company name, human name., title), syntactic 
patterns (i.e. where a conll)any name, a human name, 
or a title appears in a sentence) and several specific 
lexical items which come immediately after tim com- 
pany Ilallies. 
3.2  Test  Resu l ts  
The three lnethods haw'. heen tested on the develop- 
merit data from which the lnethods were produced 
and on the set. of unseen test data. 
3.2.1 Aga ins t  the  dew; lo lmient  data  
As mentioned in section two, there are 42 cases of 
dousha with ga and 66 cases of dousha with ha. 
For the dousha with ga rases, the Simple Clos- 
est Method identifie.s the referents 67% correctly (27 
correct out of 42), and the second inethod does so 
90% (38 out of 42) correctly. ,qCM misses a number 
of referents whMi appear iii previous entences, and 
most of those which appear two or inore sentelices 
previously. 
For the cases of dousha with ha, SCM identities 
the referents correctly only 52% (34 correct out of 
66), however, the third heuristic method correctly 
ideiltilies 94% (62 out of 66). 
3.2.2 Aga ins t  the  test; data  
The test data was taken front Japanese newspaper 
articles on micro-electronics. There are 1078 arti-- 
c.les, and 51 cases of dousha with ga and 250 cases of 
dousha with ha. The test has been conducted against 
the. all get cases (51 of them) and the first t O0 Bet cases. 
For the dousha with ga cases, the Simple Clos- 
est Method identifies the referents 80% correctly (4 I 
correct out of 51), and the second method does so 
96% (49 out of 51) correctly. 
For the c~Lses of dousha with ha, SCM identifies 
the referents correctly only 83% (83 correct out of 
100), however, tl,e third heuristic method correctly 
ide.ntifies 96% (96 out of 100). 
The following table, Table 3, shows the summary 
of the test. results.

4 D ISCUSSION 
Tile second and third heuristic methods how high 
accuracy in finding the referents of dousha with ga 
and ha. This means that partial semantic parsing 
(in which key semantic information such as company 
name, human name, and title is marked) is snfli- 
cient for reference resolution of important referential 
expressions such as dousha in Japanese. Moreover, 
since the two modified methods are simple, they will 
be easily implemented by computationally inexpen- 
sive finite-state pattern matchers (Hobbs el aL 1992; 
Cowie ct al. 1993). Therefore, they will be suitable 
for large scale text processing (Jaeobs 1992; Chinchor 
el al. 1993). 
One important point to realize is that the sec- 
ond and third methods, although they are simple to 
implement, achieve something that is rather compli- 
cated and may be computatlonally expensive other- 
wise. For example, in order to find the correct refer- 
ent of a given dousha, you may have to skip one entire 
paragraph and find the referent wo paragraphs be- 
fore, or you may have to choose the right company 
name from several possible company names which ap- 
pear before the given dousha. The modified methods 
do this correctly most of the time without worrying 
about constructing sometimes complicated syntactic 
structures of the sentences in the search window for 
the possible referent. 
Another important point is that the modified 
methods make good use of post-nominal particles, 
especially ha and ga. For example, if the referent is 
located two sentences or more before, then the ref- 
erent (the company name) comes with ha ahnost all 
the time (35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha). 
It seems that if tile referent of the dousha in consid- 
eration is more than a certain distance before, two 
sentences in this case, then tile referent is marked 
with ha most of the time. Kitani also uses this ha 
or ga marked company names as key information i  
his reference resolution algorithm for dousha (Kitani 
1994). 
5 CONCLUSION 
The locations and contexts of tile referents of dousha 
in Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined by 
hand. Three henristic methods are proposed and 
tested. The methods which use semantic informa- 
tion in the text and its patterns how high accuracy 
in finding the referents (96% for dousha with ga and 
96% for dousha with ha for the unseen test data). The 
high success rates snggest hat a semantic pattern- 
matching approach is not only a valid method but 
also an ef\[icicnt method for reference resolution in 
the newspaper article domains. Since the Japanese 
language ishighly case-inflected, case (particle) infof 
mation is used effectively in these methods for refer- 
ence resolution. -How much one can do with semantic 
pattern matching for reference resolution of similar 
expressions such as "the company" or "tile Japanese 
company" in English newspaper articles is a topic for 
fllture research.
