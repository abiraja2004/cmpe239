Abstract
We describe our submissions to the WMT11
shared MT evaluation task: MTeRater and
MTeRater-Plus. Both are machine-learned
metrics that use features from e-rater R?, an au-
tomated essay scoring engine designed to as-
sess writing proficiency. Despite using only
features from e-rater and without comparing
to translations, MTeRater achieves a sentence-
level correlation with human rankings equiva-
lent to BLEU. Since MTeRater only assesses
fluency, we build a meta-metric, MTeRater-
Plus, that incorporates adequacy by combin-
ing MTeRater with other MT evaluation met-
rics and heuristics. This meta-metric has a
higher correlation with human rankings than
either MTeRater or individual MT metrics
alone. However, we also find that e-rater fea-
tures may not have significant impact on cor-
relation in every case.
1 Introduction
The evaluation of machine translation (MT) systems
has received significant interest over the last decade
primarily because of the concurrent rising interest in
statistical machine translation. The majority of re-
search on evaluating translation quality has focused
on metrics that compare translation hypotheses to a
set of human-authored reference translations. How-
ever, there has also been some work on methods that
are not dependent on human-authored translations.
One subset of such methods is task-based in that
the methods determine the quality of a translation in
terms of how well it serves the need of an extrin-
sic task. These tasks can either be downstream NLP
tasks such as information extraction (Parton et al,
2009) and information retrieval (Fujii et al, 2009) or
human tasks such as answering questions on a read-
ing comprehension test (Jones et al, 2007).
Besides extrinsic evaluation, there is another set
of methods that attempt to ?learn? what makes a
good translation and then predict the quality of new
translations without comparing to reference trans-
lations. Corston-Oliver et al (2001) proposed the
idea of building a decision tree classifier to sim-
ply distinguish between machine and human transla-
tions using language model (LM) and syntactic fea-
tures. Kulesza and Shieber (2004) attempt the same
task using an support vector machine (SVM) classi-
fier and features derived from reference-based MT
metrics such as WER, PER, BLEU and NIST. They
also claim that the confidence score for the classi-
fier being used, if available, may be taken as an es-
timate of translation quality. Quirk (2004) took a
different approach and examined whether it is pos-
sible to explicitly compute a confidence measure for
each translated sentence by using features derived
from both the source and target language sides. Al-
brecht and Hwa (2007a) expanded on this idea and
conducted a larger scale study to show the viabil-
ity of regression as a sentence-level metric of MT
quality. They used features derived from several
other reference-driven MT metrics. In other work
(Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b), they showed that one
could substitute translations from other MT systems
for human-authored reference translations and de-
rive the regression features from them.
Gamon et al (2005) build a classifier to distin-
guish machine-generated translations from human
108
ones using fluency-based features and show that by
combining the scores of this classifier with LM per-
plexities, they obtain an MT metric that has good
correlation with human judgments but not better
than the baseline BLEU metric.
The fundamental questions that inspired our pro-
posed metrics are as follows:
? Can an operational English-proficiency mea-
surement system, built with absolutely no fore-
thought of using it for evaluation of translation
quality, actually be used for this purpose?
? Obviously, such a system can only assess the
fluency of a translation hypothesis and not the
adequacy. Can the features derived from this
system then be combined with metrics such
as BLEU, METEOR or TERp?measures of
adequacy?to yield a metric that performs bet-
ter?
The first metric we propose (MTeRater) is an
SVM ranking model that uses features derived from
the ETS e-rater R? system to assess fluency of trans-
lation hypotheses. Our second metric (MTeRater-
Plus) is a meta-metric that combines MTeRater fea-
tures with metrics such as BLEU, METEOR and
TERp as well as features inspired by other MT met-
rics.
Although our work is intimately related to some
of the work cited above in that it is a trained regres-
sion model predicting translation quality at the sen-
tence level, there are two important differences:
1. We do not use any human translations ? ref-
erence or otherwise ? for MTeRater, not even
when training the metric. The classifier is
trained using human judgments of translation
quality provided as part of the shared evalua-
tion task.
2. Most of the previous approaches use feature
sets that are designed to capture both transla-
tion adequacy and fluency. However, MTeRater
uses only fluency-based features.
The next section provides some background on
the e-rater system. Section 3 presents a discussion
of the differences between MT errors and learner er-
rors. Section 4 describes how we use e-rater to build
our metrics. Section 5 outlines our experiments and
Section 5 discusses the results of these experiments.
Finally, we conclude in Section 6.
2 E-rater
E-rater is a proprietary automated essay scoring
system developed by Educational Testing Service
(ETS) to assess writing quality.1 The system has
been used operationally for over 10 years in high-
stakes exams such as the GRE and TOEFL given
its speed, reliability and high agreement with human
raters.
E-rater combines 8 main features using linear re-
gression to produce a numerical score for an es-
say. These features are grammar, usage, mechan-
ics, style, organization, development, lexical com-
plexity and vocabulary usage. The grammar feature
covers errors such as sentence fragments, verb form
errors and pronoun errors (Chodorow and Leacock,
2000). The usage feature detects errors related to
articles (Han et al, 2006), prepositions (Tetreault
and Chodorow, 2008) and collocations (Futagi et al,
2008). The mechanics feature checks for spelling,
punctuation and capitalization errors. The style fea-
ture checks for passive constructions and word rep-
etition, among others. Organization and develop-
ment tabulate the presence or absence of discourse
elements and the length of each element. Finally,
the lexical complexity feature details how complex
the writer?s words are based on frequency indices
and writing scales, and the vocabulary feature eval-
uates how appropriate the words are for the given
topic). Since many of the features are essay-specific,
there is certainly some mismatch between what e-
rater was intended for and the genres we are using it
for in this experiment (translated news articles).
In our work, we separate e-rater features into two
classes: sentence level and document level. The
sentence level features consist of all errors marked
by the various features for each sentence alone. In
contrast, the document level features are an aggre-
gation of the sentence level features for the entire
document.

paper and the reader is referred to (Attali and Burstein, 2006).

3 Learner Errors vs. MT Errors
Since e-rater is trained on human-written text and
designed to look for errors in usage that are com-
mon to humans, one research question is whether it
is even useful for assessing the fluency of machine
translated text. E-rater is unaware of the transla-
tion context, so it does not look for common MT
errors, such as untranslated words, mistranslations
and deleted content words. However, these may get
flagged as other types of learner errors: spelling mis-
takes, confused words, and sentence fragments.
Machine translations do contain learner-like mis-
takes in verb conjugations and word order. In an
error analysis of SMT output, Vilar et al (2006) re-
port that 9.9% - 11.7% of errors made by a Spanish-
English SMT system were incorrect word forms, in-
cluding incorrect tense, person or number. These
error types are also account for roughly 14% of er-
rors made by ESL (English as a Second Language)
writers in the Cambridge Learner Corpus (Leacock
et al, 2010).
On the other hand, some learner mistakes are un-
likely to be made by MT systems. The Spanish-
English SMT system made almost no mistakes in
idioms (Vilar et al, 2006). Idiomatic expressions
are strongly preferred by language models, but may
be difficult for learners to memorize (?kicked a
bucket?). Preposition usage is a common problem
in non-native English text, accounting for 29% of
errors made by intermediate to advanced ESL stu-
dents (Bitchener et al, 2005) but language models
are less likely to prefer local preposition errors e.g.,
?he went to outside?. On the other hand, a language
model will likely not prevent errors in prepositions
(or in other error types) that rely on long-distance
dependencies.
4 E-rating Machine Translation
The MTeRater metric uses only features from e-rater
to score translations. The features are produced di-
rectly from the MT output, with no comparison to
reference translations, unlike most MT evaluation
metrics (such as BLEU, TERp and METEOR).
An obvious deficit of MTeRater is a measure of
adequacy, or how much meaning in the source sen-
tence is expressed in the translation. E-rater was
not developed for assessing translations, and the
MTeRater metric never compares the translation to
the source sentence. To remedy this, we propose
the MTeRater-Plus meta-metric that uses e-rater fea-
tures plus all of the hybrid features described below.
Both metrics were trained on the same data using
the same machine learning model, and differ only in
their feature sets.
4.1 E-rater Features
Each sentence is associated with an e-rater sentence-
level vector and a document-level vector as previ-
ously described and each column in these vectors
was used a feature.
4.2 Features for Hybrid Models
We used existing automatic MT metrics as baselines
in our evaluation, and also as features in our hybrid
metric. The metrics we used were:
1. BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002): Case-insensitive
and case-sensitive BLEU scores were pro-
duced using mteval-v13a.pl, which calculates
smoothed sentence-level scores.
2. TERp (Snover et al, 2009): Translation Edit
Rate plus (TERp) scores were produced using
terp v1. The scores were case-insensitive and
edit costs from Snover et al (2009) were used
to produce scores tuned for fluency and ade-
quacy.
3. METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009): Me-
teor scores were produced using Meteor-next
v1.2. All types of matches were allowed (ex-
act, stem, synonym and paraphrase) and scores
tuned specifically to rank, HTER and adequacy
were produced using the ?-t? flag in the tool.
We also implemented features closely related to
or inspired by other MT metrics. The set of these
auxiliary features is referred to as ?Aux?.
1. Character-level statistics: Based on the suc-
cess of the i-letter-BLEU and i-letter-recall
metrics from WMT10 (Callison-Burch et al,
2010), we added the harmonic mean of preci-
sion (or recall) for character n-grams (from 1
to 10) as features.
110
2. Raw n-gram matches: We calculated the pre-
cision and precision for word n-grams (up to
n=6) and added each as a separate feature (for
a total of 12). Although these statistics are also
calculated as part of the MT metrics above,
breaking them into separate features gives the
model more information.
3. Length ratios: The ratio between the lengths
of the MT output and the reference translation
was calculated on a character level and a word
level. These ratios were also calculated be-
tween the MT output and the source sentence.
4. OOV heuristic: The percentage of tokens in
the MT that match the source sentence. This
is a low-precision heuristic for counting out of
vocabulary (OOV) words, since it also counts
named entities and words that happen to be the
same in different languages.
4.3 Ranking Model
Following (Duh, 2008), we represent sentence-level
MT evaluation as a ranking problem. For a partic-
ular source sentence, there are N machine transla-
tions and one reference translation. A feature vector
is extracted from each {source, reference, MT} tu-
ple. The training data consists of sets of translations
that have been annotated with relative ranks. Dur-
ing training, all ranked sets are converted to sets of
feature vectors, where the label for each feature vec-
tor is the rank. The ranking model is a linear SVM
that predicts a relative score for each feature vector,
and is implemented by SVM-rank (Joachims, 2006).
When the trained classifier is applied to a set of N
translations for a new source sentence, the transla-
tions can then be ranked by sorting the SVM scores.
5 Experiments
All experiments were run using data from three
years of previous WMT shared tasks (WMT08,
WMT09 and WMT10). In these evaluations, anno-
tators were asked to rank 3-5 translation hypothe-
ses (with ties allowed), given a source sentence and
a reference translation, although they were only re-
quired to be fluent in the target language.
Since e-rater was developed to rate English sen-
tences only, we only evaluated tasks with English
as the target language. All years included source
languages French, Spanish, German and Czech.
WMT08 and WMT09 also included Hungarian and
multisource English. The number of MT systems
was different for each language pair and year, from
as few as 2 systems (WMT08 Hungarian-English) to
as many as 25 systems (WMT10 German-English).
All years had a newswire testset, which was divided
into stories. WMT08 had testsets in two additional
genres, which were not split into documents.
All translations were pre-processed and run
through e-rater. Each document was treated as an es-
say, although news articles are generally longer than
essays. Testsets that were not already divided into
documents were split into pseudo-documents of 20
contiguous sentences or less. Missing end of sen-
tence markers were added so that e-rater would not
merge neighboring sentences.
6 Results
For assessing our metrics prior to WMT11, we
trained on WMT08 and WMT09 and tested on
WMT10. The metrics we submitted to WMT11
were trained on all three years. One criticism of
machine-learned evaluation metrics is that they may
be too closely tuned to a few MT systems, and thus
not generalize well as MT systems evolve or when
judging new sets of systems. In this experiment,
WMT08 has 59 MT systems, WMT09 has 70 dif-
ferent MT systems, and WMT10 has 75 different
systems. Different systems participate each year,
and those that participate for multiple years often
improve from year to year. By training and test-
ing across years rather than within years, we hope
to avoid overfitting.
To evaluate, we measure correlation between each
metric and the human annotated rankings according
to (Callison-Burch et al, 2010): Kendall?s tau is cal-
culated for each language pair and the results are
averaged across language pairs. This is preferable
to averaging across all judgments because the num-
ber of systems and the number of judgments vary
based on the language pair (e.g., there were 7,911
ranked pairs for 14 Spanish-English systems, and
3,575 ranked pairs for 12 Czech-English systems).
It is difficult to calculate the statistical signifi-
cance of Kendall?s tau on these data. Unlike the

Metrics MATR annotations (Przybocki et al, 2009),
(Peterson and Przybocki, 2010), the WMT judg-
ments do not give a full ranking over all systems for
all judged sentences. Furthermore, the 95% confi-
dence intervals of Kendall?s tau are known to be very
large (Carterette, 2009) ? in Metrics MATR 2010,
the top 7 metrics in the paired-preference single-
reference into-English track were within the same
confidence interval.
To compare metrics, we use McNemar?s test
of paired proportions (Siegel and Castellan, 1988)
which is more powerful than tests of independent
proportions, such as the chi-square test for indepen-
dent samples.2 As in Kendall?s tau, each metric?s
relative ranking of a translation pair is compared to
that of a human. Two metrics, A and B, are com-
pared by counting the number of times both A and B
agree with the human ranking, the number of times
A disagrees but B agrees, the number of times A
agrees but B disagrees, and the number of times both
A and B disagree. These counts can be arranged in
a 2 x 2 contingency table as shown below.
A agrees A disagrees
B agrees a b
B disagrees c d
McNemar?s test determines if the cases of mis-
match in agreement between the metrics (cells b and
c) are symmetric or if there is a significant difference

in favor of one of the metrics showing more agree-
ment with the human than the other. The two-tailed
probability for McNemar?s test can be calculated us-
ing the binomial distribution over cells b and c.
6.1 Reference-Free Evaluation with MTeRater
The first group of rows in Table 1 shows the
Kendall?s tau correlation with human rankings of
MTeRater and the best-performing version of the
three standard MT metrics. Even though MTeR-
ater is blind to the MT context and does not use the
source or references at all, MTeRater?s correlation
with human judgments is the same as case-sensitive
bleu (bleu-case). This indicates that a metric trained
to assess English proficiency in non-native speakers
is applicable to machine translated text.
6.2 Meta-Metrics
The second group in Table 1 shows the cor-
relations of our second metric, MTeRater-Plus
(BMT+Aux+MTeRater), and a baseline meta-metric
(BMT) that combined BLEU, METEOR and TERp.
MTeRater-Plus performs significantly better than
BMT, according to McNemar?s test.
We also wanted to determine whether the e-
rater features have any significant impact when used
as part of meta-metrics. To this end, we first
created two variants of MTeRater-Plus: one that
removed the MTeRater features (BMT+Aux) and
another that replaced the MTeRater features with
the LM likelihood and perplexity of the sentence
(BMT+Aux+LM).3 Both models perform as well
as MTeRater-Plus, i.e., adding additional fluency
features (either LM scores or MTeRater) to the
BMT+Aux meta-metric has no significant impact.
To determine whether this was generally the case,
we also created two variants of the BMT baseline
meta-metric that added fluency features to it: one in
the form of LM scores (BMT+LM) and another in
the form of the MTeRater score (BMT+MTeRater).
Based on McNemar?s test, both models are sig-
nificantly better than BMT, indicating that these
reference-free fluency features indeed capture an as-
pect of translation quality that is absent from the
standard MT metrics. However, there is no signfi-
cant difference between the two variants of BMT.

provided by WMT10 organizers.

6.3 Discussion
Table 2 shows two pairs of ranked translations (MT+
is better than MT-), along with some of the errors de-
tected by e-rater. In pair 1, the lower-ranked trans-
lation has major problems in fluency as detected by
e-rater, but due to n-gram overlap with the reference,
bleu-case ranks it higher. In pair 2, MT- is more
fluent but missing two named entities and bleu-case
correctly ranks it lower.
One disadvantage of machine-learned metrics is
that it is not always clear which features caused one
translation to be ranked higher than another. We
did a feature ablation study for MTeRater which
showed that document-level collocation features sig-
nificantly improve the metric, as do features for
sentence-level preposition errors. Discourse-level
features were harmful to MT evaluation. This is un-
surprising, since MT sentences are judged one at a
time, so any discourse context is lost.
Overall, a metric with only document-level fea-
tures does better than one with only sentence-level
features due to data sparsity ? many sentences have
no errors, and we conjecture that the document-level
features are a proxy for the quality of the MT sys-
tem. Combining both document-level and sentence-
level e-rater features does significantly better than
either alone. Incorporating document-level features
into sentence-level evaluation had one unforeseen
effect: two identical translations can get different
scores depending on how the rest of the document
is translated. While using features that indicate the
relative quality of MT systems can improve overall
correlation, it fails when the sentence-level signal is
not strong enough to overcome the prior belief.
7 Conclusion
We described our submissions to the WMT11 shared
evaluation task: MTeRater and MTeRater-Plus.
MTeRater is a fluency-based metric that uses fea-
tures from ETS?s operational English-proficiency
measurement system (e-rater) to predict the qual-
ity of any translated sentence. MTeRater-Plus is a
meta-metric that combines MTeRater?s fluency-only
features with standard MT evaluation metrics and
heuristics. Both metrics are machine-learned mod-
els trained to rank new translations based on existing
human judgments of translation.
Our experiments showed that MTeRater, by it-
self, achieves a sentence-level correlation as high as
BLEU, despite not using reference translations. In
addition, the meta-metric MTeRater-Plus achieves
higher correlations than MTeRater, BLEU, ME-
TEOR, TERp as well as a baseline meta-metric com-
bining BLEU, METEOR and TERp (BMT). How-
ever, further analysis showed that the MTeRater
component of MTeRater-Plus does not contribute
significantly to this improved correlation. How-
ever, when added to the BMT baseline meta-metric,
MTeRater does make a significant contribution.
Our results, despite being a mixed bag, clearly
show that a system trained to assess English-
language proficiency can be useful in providing an
indication of translation fluency even outside of the
specific WMT11 evaluation task. We hope that this
work will spur further cross-pollination between the
fields of MT evaluation and grammatical error de-
tection. For example, we would like to explore using
MTeRater for confidence estimation in cases where
reference translations are unavailable, such as task-
oriented MT.
