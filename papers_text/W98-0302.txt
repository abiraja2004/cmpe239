Abstract 
RASTA (Rhetorical Structure Theory 
Analyzer), a system for automatic discourse 
analysis, reliably, identifies rhetorical 
relations present m written discourse by 
examining information available in syntactic 
and logical form analyses. Since there is a 
many-to-many relationship between 
rhetorical relations and elements of linguistic 
form, RASTA identifies relations by the 
convergence of a number of pieces of 
evidence, many of which would be 
insufficient in isolation to reliably identify a 
relation. 
1. Introduction 
Within Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann 
and Thompson 1986, 1988), the discourse 
structure of a text is represented by means of a 
hierarchical tree diagram in which contiguous 
text spans are related by labeled relations. 
Hierarchical structure results from the fact that 
each text span in a labeled relation may itself 
have a complex internal discourse structure. 
Traditionally, human analysts have constructed 
RST analyses for texts by employing tacit, 
subjective, intuitive judgments. RASTA (Corston- 
Oliver 1998a, 1998b), a discourse analysis 
component within the Microsoft English 
Grammar, automatically produces RST analyses 
of texts. To do so, it proceeds in three stages. In 
the first stage, RASTA identifies the clauses that 
function as terminal nodes in an RST analysis. In 
the second stage, RASTA examines all possible 
pairs of terminal nodes to determine which 
discourse relation, if any, might hold between the 
two nodes. In the third stage, RASTA combines 
the terminal nodes according to the discourse 
relations that it hypothesized to form RST 
analyses of a complete text. 
This paper discusses the second stage of 
processing, during which RASTA identifies 
discourse relations. Whereas introspection is a 
viable strategy for human analysts, a 
computational discourse analysis system like 
RASTA requires explicit methods for identifying 
discourse relations. This paper therefore 
describes (section 2) the kinds of linguistic 
evidence that RASTA considers in positing 
discourse structure. Intuitively, cues to discourse 
relations are not all equally compelling. This 
intuition is reflected in the use of heuristic scores 
(section 3) to measure the plausibility of a 
relation. Section 5 describes in detail the cues 
used to identify the SEQUENCE relation and gives 
a worked example. For a more complete 
description of the workings of RASTA, the reader 
is referred to Corston-Oliver (1998b). 
The Microsoft English Grammar (MEG) is a 
broad-coverage grammar of English that 
performs a morphological analysis, a 
conventional syntactic onstituent analysis and a 
logical form analysis (involving the 
normalization of syntactic alternations to yield a 
representation with the flavor of a predicate 
representation). Functional roles such as subject 
and object are identified and anaphoric references 
are resolved uring linguistic analysis. 
To date, I have focused on the text of Encarta 
96 (Microsoft Corporation 1995, henceforth 
Encarta), a general purpose electronic 
encyclopedia whose articles exhibit a variety of 
complex discourse structures. All examples in 
this paper are taken from Encarta. References 
given are to the titles of articles. 
2. Identifying rhetorical 
relations 
In the computational discourse analysis literature, 
there are three strands concerning the 
identification of rhetorical relations. The first 
strand (Knott and Dale 1995; Kurohashi and 
Nagao 1994; Marcu 1997; Ono et al 1994; 
Sanders 1992; Sanders et al 1992, 1993; Sanders 
and van Wijk 1996; Sumita et al 1992) concerns 
the identification of rhetorical relations by fairly 
superficial means. Typically simple pattern 
matching is used to identify cue phrases. These 
cue phrases are then assumed to be in a one-to- 
one relationship to rhetorical relations. 
The second strand (Fukumoto and Tsujii 1994; 
Hobbs 1979), in contrast to the first strand, 
eschews an examination of the form of a text in 
favor of reasoning with more abstract 
representations such as predicate representations 
of linguistic content and axiomatic 
representations of world knowledge. 
The third strand concerns programmatic 
descriptions of how a computational discourse 
analysis might proceed (Polanyi 1988; Wu and 
Lytinen 1990), with no specific details about how 
discourse relations might be identified. 
RASTA identifies rhetorical relations by 
directly examining a text, and is therefore most 
closely aligned with the first of these three 
strands. Like previous work in this vein, RASTA 
considers cue phrases to be a useful indicator of 
rhetorical relations (section 2.3). However, 
RASTA goes beyond a simple examination of cue 
phrases and considers uch linguistic evidence as 
clausal status (section 2.1), anaphora, deixis and 
referential continuity (section 2.2) and tense, 
aspect, and polarity (section 5). 
Traditionally, RST analysts have been averse to 
tying their analyses of discourse structure to 
specific elements of linguistic form. The 
descriptions of rhetorical relations in Mann and 
Thompson (1986~ 1988), for example, studiously 
avoid all mention of the correlates of discourse 
structure. This aversion is apparently intended to 
avoid "naive mono-functionalism", i.e. the 
overly-simplistic assumption of a one-to-one 
mapping between linguistic form and rhetorical 
structure. This laudable concern is accompanied 
by a general pessimism. For example, Mann and 
Thompson (1986:71-72) note that "we do not 
believe that there are undiscovered signal forms, 
and we do not believe that text form can ever 
provide a definitive basis for describing how 
relational propositions can be discerned." Instead 
of looking for simple one-to-one mappings 
between linguistic form and discourse structure, 
RASTA considers a number of small cues that 
stand in many-to-many relations to rhetorical 
relations. By allowing these minor cues to 
converge in identifying discourse relations, the 
prospects for identifying rhetorical relations 
appear osy, as this paper demonstrates. 
2.1. Clausal status 
Each RST relation can be classified as a member 
of one of two structural types: symmetric and 
asymmetric. Symmetric relations (CONTRAST, 
JOINT, LIST, SEQUENCE, etc.) consist of two or 
more co-nuclei, each of which is equally 
important in realizing the writer's communicative 
goals. Asymmetric relations (CAUSE, 
ELABORATION, CONCESSION, etc.) have two 
constituents: a nucleus, the more central element 
in realizing the writer's goals, and a satellite, a 
less important element hat is in a dependency 
relation to the nucleus. 
Matthiessen and Thompson (1988) suggest that 
the grammatical distinction between paratactic 
clause combining (including coordination, 
apposition and quoting) and hypotactic clause 
combining (including various kinds of clausal 
subordination) represents the grammaticization 
of the two different kinds of RST relation. This 
proposal motivates the most important 
discriminator f rhetorical relations employed by 
RASTA. Hypotactic lause combining, identified 
by the syntactic analysis performed by MEG, 
always suggests an asymmetric RST relation in 
which the matrix clause is posited to be the 
nucleus and the subordinate clause to be the 
satellite. Paratactic lause combining, however, 
may correspond to either a symmetric or an 
asymmetric RST relation. 
In rare cases, this correlation between clausal 
status and rhetorical status is the only clue to 
discourse structure that RASTA is able to identify, 
i.e. having correctly identified a hypotactic 
relationship, RASTA is unable to identify a 
specific corresponding asymmetric rhetorical 
relation. In such cases, RASTA proposes an 
asymmetric relationship which it then labels with 
a question mark, as illustrated in Figure 1. 
Clause: is clearly a satellite of Clause,. However, 
it is not quite clear exactly what RST relation 
holds. The PURPOSE or RESULT relations are 
weak candidates, but certainly not inviting 
enough to warrant a commitment toeither.

2. adapting the animal for rapid digging into 
hard ground.

2.2. Anaphora, deixis and 
referential continuity 
Anaphora, deixis and referential continuity are 
strongly cohesive devices (Halliday and Hasan 
1976). Often, RASTA need do no more than 
identify the form of a referring device, without 
actually resolving the referent. Pronouns and 
demonstratives, for example, are frequently 
positively correlated with the satellite of an 
asymmetric relation, especially when they occur 
as syntactic subjects or as modifiers of subjects, 
and negatively correlated with the co-nucleus of 
a symmetric relation (see for example criterion 4 
for the SEQUENCE relation in Figure 3, section 5). 
In other cases, the form of a referring 
expression is insufficient, and RASTA must 
consider eferential continuity. The MEG system 
resolves pronominal anaphoric references during 
the construction of the logical form. Although 
MEG is sometimes able to identify a single 
antecedent for a pronoun, it often proposes a list 
of plausible antecedents. In determining subject 
continuity, the most important kind of referential 
continuity for identifying discourse relations, 
RASTA considers whether the subject of one 
clause is one of the possible antecedents of the 
subject of another clause. For a pronominal 
subject, RASTA examines the list of proposed 
antecedents. For a subject modified by a 
possessive pronoun, RASTA considers the 
proposed antecedents of the possessive pronoun. 
For lexical subjects, RASTA considers simply 
whether the head of the subject noun phrase of 
one clause is identical to the head of the subject 
noun phrase of the other clause. (MEG does not 
currently perform anaphora resolution for lexical 
noun phrases.) 
2.3. Cue phrases 
Many clauses contain cue phrases that provide 
evidence of rhetorical structure. Like other 
approaches to identifying rhetorical structure 
(Ono et al 1994; Knott and Dale 1995; Marcu 
1997), RASTA recognizes cue phrases as a 
valuable source of evidence. RASTA, however, 
attempts to overcome two problems related to 
cue phrases: compositionality, i.e. some cue 
phrases are amenable to different compositional 
analyses, and coverage, i.e. not all clauses 
contain cue phrases. 
Some phrases ought o be treated as lexicalized 
units in some contexts and as phrases with 
internal constituency in other contexts. The 
Encarta article Quasar, for example, contains the 
phrase as long as in sentence medial position: 
"...their observed light would have been 
traveling practically as long as the age of the 
universe." Such instances of the phrase as long 
as are amenable to a compositional nalysis. In 
other cases, the same phrase in sentence-medial 
position ought to be treated as a lexicalized unit, 
analogous to the subordinating conjunction 
provided, as illustrated in Figure 2.

2. as long as they have the support of a 
majority in the provincial legislature.  onditio~

Figure 2 Prince Edward Island 
RASTA examines cue phrases as a form of 
evidence for rhetorical structure, distinguishing 
ambiguous readings of phrases like as long as on 
the basis of the syntactic analysis performed by 
MEG. 
Unfortunately, it is not the case that all clauses 
contain useful cue phrases. Cue phrases are 
therefore insufficient for the task of constructing 
discourse representations that cover an entire 
text. To overcome this deficiency, RASTA 
augments cue phrases with additional evidence 
available in a text. 
3. Necessary criteria and cues 
The process of hypothesizing discourse relations 
involves tension between two competing 
concerns. On the one hand, it is desirable to 
postulate all possible discourse relations that 
might hold between two terminal nodes, in order 
to ensure that the preferred RST analysis for a 
text is always in the set of analyses produced by 
RASTA. On the other hand, considerations of 
computational efficiency lead us to desire a small 
set of relations, since as the number of possible 
discourse relations increases, the number of 
possible discourse trees to be considered 
increases exponentially; the smaller the set of 
hypothesized relations, the more quickly the 
algorithm for constructing RST trees (Corston- 
Oliver 1998a, 1998b) can test all possibilities. 
RASTA resolves this tension by distinguishing 
two kinds of evidence. The first kind of evidence 
is the set of necessary criteriamthe conditions 
that simply must be met before RASTA is even 
willing to "consider" a given discourse relation. 
The second kind of evidence is the set of cues 
that are only applied if the necessary criteria are 
satisfied. Coordination by means of the 
conjunction and, for example, correlates with the 
SEQUENCE conjunction (Figure 6, section 5), but 
only weakly. If we were to posit a SEQUENCE 
relation every time we observed the conjunction 
and, we would posit a great many spurious 
relations. However, RASTA only tests this cue if 
an extensive set of necessary criteria for the 
SEQUENCE relation have been satisfied (Figure 3, 
section 5). 
The cues that RASTA uses tO identify rhetorical 
relations by no means constitute an exhaustive 
list of the correlates of each relation. Rather, the 
cues that RASTA employs are sufficient o enable 
it to distinguish reliably among the thirteen 
relations (ASYMMETRICCONTRAST, CAUSE, 
CIRCUMSTANCE, CONCESSION, CONDITION, 
CONTRAST, ELABORATION, JOINT, LIST, MEANS, 
PURPOSE, RESULT, SEQUENCE) necessary for an 
adequate discourse analysis of the text of the 
articles in Encarta. The extent o which the cues 
used by RASTA correspond to the evidence that 
human readers use when attempting to 
understand the discourse structure of a text is a 
matter for independent experimental 
investigation. 
4. Heuristic scores 
RASTA examines many cues in identifying 
rhetorical relations. Intuitively, these different 
cues are not of equal weight. To reflect this 
intuition, RASTA associates a heuristic score with 
each cue. Each cue is thus able to "vote" for a 
relation. Each relation receives a score, equal to 
the sum of the heuristic scores of the cues that 
voted in favor of that relation. 
The heuristic scores assigned accord well with 
human linguistic intuitions. However, the 
primary role of the heuristic scores is to guide 
RASTA in subsequent s ages of processing. When 
constructing RST trees, RASTA applies the 
relations with the highest scores first. This causes 
RASTA to' converge on better analyses of a text 
before producing less plausible analyses 
(Corston-Oliver 1998a, 1998b). 
5. The SEQUENCE relation 
To illustrate the kinds of evidence that RASTA 
considers, let us consider how RASTA identifies 
the SEQUENCE relation. The SEQUENCE relation 
is a symmetric relation in which two or more 
clauses report events that are in a relationship of 
temporal succession. Figure 3 gives the necessary 
criteria for the SEQUENCE relation. If the 
necessary criteria are satisfied, then it is 
reasonable to posit a SEQUENCE relation between 
two clauses. The criteria are sufficiently stringent 
that an initial heuristic score of 20 is associated 
with this hypothesized relation. 
11 
1. Clause, precedes Clause 2. 
2. Clause~ is not syntactically subordinate to 
Clause-,. 
3. Clause_, is not syntactically subordinate to 
Clauses. 
4. The subject of Clause: is not a 
demonstrative pronoun, nor is it modified 
by a demonstrative. 
5. Neither Clause~ nor Clause s has 
progressive aspect (marked by the -ing 
verbal suffix). 
6. If either Clause, nor Clause, has negative 
polarity, then it must also have an explicit 
indication of time. 
7. Neither Clause, nor Clause, is a Wh 
question. 
8.Neither Clausej nor Clause: has an 
attributive predicate. 
9.The event expressed in Clause, does not 
temporally precede the event in Clause c
10. Clause I and Clause, match in tense and 
aspect. 
11. Clause 2 must not be immediately 
governed by a contrast conjunction. 
Figure 3 Necessary criteria for the SEQUENCE 
relation 
A few of the necessary criteria merit special 
discussion. Criteria 2 and 3 are intended to 
exclude situations in which one clause is 
syntactically subordinate to another, since a 
relationship of grammatical subordination always 
corresponds to an asymmetric relation (section 
2.1), whereas the SEQUENCE relation is a 
symmetric relation. 
Criterion 4, "The subject of Clause, is not a 
demonstrative pronoun, nor is it modified by a 
demonstrative", is intended to block cases in 
which the correlations between deixis and 
discourse structure (section 2.2) would make an 
asymmetric relation more likely than the 
symmetric SEQUENCE relation. For example, in 
the following excerpt, a SEQUENCE relation is 
dispreferred in the face of a more plausible 
RESULT relation because the subject of the 
second main clause, this study, contains a 
demonstrative: 
"He made a study of the famous Adams 
family of Massachusetts, to which he 
was not related; this study resulted in 
"The Adams Family"..." (Adams, 
James Truslow). 
Since the SEQUENCE relation involves a 
narrative sequence of events, criterion 5, "Neither 
Clause I nor Clause, has progressive aspect...", 
excludes clauses which are not eventive, as in the 
following example: 
"Abbott was willing to admit a number 
of manufactured goods from the United 
States duty-free" (Abbot, Sir John 
Joseph Caldwell). 
For the most part, clauses with negative 
polarity do not express events and therefore 
cannot enter into the SEQUENCE relation. One 
notable exception to this generalization is clauses 
with negative polarity which also contain an 
explicit indication of time (criterion 6), as 
illustrated in Figure 4. The clause with negative 
polarity and an explicit indication of time is 
given in bold type. This clause entails an event 
which is in a SEQUENCE relation with other 
events. RASTA does not require a sophisticated 
reasoning module to detect this entailment. 
Rather, the mere presence of an explicit 
indication of time within a negative clause 
appears to be sufficient o identify the entailment 
in this instance and in other similar instances. 
Prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses 
introduced by before or until are the most 
common means of explicitly indicating time for 
clauses with negative polarity in Encarta.

Robert Gallo, was approved for use in 
blood banks.

Syndrome 
Neither Wh questions (criterion 7) nor 
12 
attributive predicates (criterion 8) report events. 
They therefore cannot participate in SEQUENCE 
relations. Changes in state, unlike attributive 
predicates, can however participate in SEQUENCE 
relations. Clause 2 in Figure 5, and \[Abacha\] 
became a captain in the army in 1967, illustrates 
a change of state. 
1.Abacha graduated from the Nigerian 
Military Training College in Zaria in 
1963,

Figure 5 Abacha, Sani 
Criteria 1 and 9 together constitute the traditional 
minimal definition of a narrative (Labov 1972; 
Reinhart 1984): a narrative sequence is one in 
which a series of tensed clauses reports a 
sequence of events, with the linear order of the 
clauses expressing the events matching the real- 
world temporal order of those events. 
Provided that the necessary criteria for the 
SEQUENCE relation are satisfied, RASTA tests the 
cues given in Figure 6. 
1.Clause, contains a sequence conjunction 
(and later then...). Score = 10. 
2. Clause, and Clause: are coordinated. Score 
=5. 
3.There is an explicit indication that the 
event expressed by Clause~ temporally 
precedes the event expressed by Clause,.. 
Score = 5. 
Figure 6 Cues for the SEQUENCE relation 
Note that RASTA does identify SEQUENCE 
conjunctions (cue 1). However, the presence of a 
SEQUENCE conjunction is not a necessary 
criterion in identifying the SEQUENCE relation. 
Explicit indications of time are of great value 
in identifying the SEQUENCE relation (criterion 9 
and cue 3). In Figure 7, for example, the events 
described in clauses 2 through 7--conferences 
being held, agreements being made, and so on m 
occur during the 1920s, the timeframe described 
in clause 1. RASTA identifies the timeframe of the 
expression the 1920s by the presence of a definite 
article with a numeric year, together with the 
presence of the plural suffix -s. The timeframe 
thus identified spans the first day of 1920 to the 
last day of 1929. It is a matter of simple math to 
determine that the dates 1920 (clause 2), 1921- 
1922 (clause 4), 1925 (clause 5) and 1928 (clause 
6) fall within this interval. 
Clause 1 describes a temporal interval within 
which the events described in clauses 2 through 7 
occur, rather than describing any event that 
precedes the events in clauses 2 through 7. 
RASTA therefore does not posit a SEQUENCE 
relation between clause 1 and any of the 
following clauses. Rather, clause 1, the topic 
sentence of this paragraph, is in an 
ELABORATION relation with the SEQUENCE node 
that spans clauses 2 through 7. 
Clauses 2 through 7 satisfy criterion 9, since 
the temporal order of the events described 
matches the temporal order of the events in the 
world and none of the clauses describes a 
temporal interval within which the events of any 
other clauses occur. Cue 3 identifies the 
appropn.'ate sequencing of the temporal 
expressions in each of the relevant clauses, 
leading RASTA to posit the SEQUENCE node 
depicted in Figure 7. 
6. Conclusion 
RASTA posits plausible rhetorical relations 
between clauses by identifying the linguistic 
correlates of rhetorical relations. The evidence 
that RASTA examines goes beyond cue phrases, 
including such cues as clausal status, anaphora, 
deixis and referential continuity. 
The form of a text represents the sum of a 
number of the decisions made by a writer. These 
decisions include the rhetorical structuring of the 
text, motivating the choice of linguistic devices 
such as specific grammatical constructions and 
tense and aspect sequencing. By examining the 
linguistic form of a text, we are able to make 
plausible inferences about rhetorical structure. 
Even subtle entailments (criterion 6, Figure 3, 
section 5) can be identified by an examination of 
linguistic form alone. 
RASTA allows for a many-to-many mapping 
between elements of linguistic form and specific 
rhetorical relations. Specific relations are 
identified by the convergence of multiple pieces 
of evidence. Future research in this vein will seek 
to mine the wealth of information present in a 
text for more cues to rhetorical structure.
