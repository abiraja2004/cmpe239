As in recent years, the last session of the Workshop focussed on 
new directions and unusual appfications of spoken language tech- 
nology. Five papers were presented. 
One of the highlights of the meeting was a presentation by Julie 
Payette, an astronaut for the Canadian Space Agency, who dis- 
cussed the use of speech recognition i  space travel. Some of the 
reasons why voice input and output are potentially valuable in 
space include the naturalness of the speech modality, the need to 
have hands and eyes available for performing applications tasks, 
and the overwhelming number of displays and controls to be inter- 
rogated and manipulated. The harsh environment of space and the 
severe consequences of failure demand that designers produce 
systems that are highly accurate, reliable, and robust. 
Payette described a pilot experiment in which a commercial 
speaker-dependent isolated-word ecognizer was used to control 
the position and functions of the closed-circuit television system. 
While subjective reports by the users were favorable, it is clear 
that accuracy and reliability will have to increase for speech to be 
used to control mission-critical functions. Recognition accuracy 
did not appear to be adversely affected by the microgravity envi- 
ronment in space. 
The second paper, presented by Suzanne Liebowitz Taylor of Uni- 
sys, described recent progress in Unisys's ongoing work on intelli- 
gent document understanding. The long-term goal of this research 
has been to develop methodologies for analyzing, classifying, and 
summarizing text from printed ocuments for which on-line ver- 
sions are not available. 
This paper discussed three ways in which natural language under- 
standing techniques was used to augment image analysis. First, a 
combination of string-matching techniques, imple grammars, and 
statistical nalysis of syntactic structure were used to re-integrate 
text which had been fragmented into physically-separated s g- 
ments, as is commonly the case for stories that are written for pop- 
ular magazines. Second, the PUNDIT natural language system 
was employed to correct errors introduced in the optical character 
recognition process. The use of natural language reduced error 
rate by more than 15 percent in an ATIS-like task for scanned text, 
compared to the error rate obtained using spelling correction 
alone. Third, case-frame parsing was used to provide semantic 
analysis of scanned ocuments. Two applications were described 
in the areas of text retrieval and hypertext generation. 
The next two papers, from SUNY Buffalo and BBN, each 
describe ways in which speech recognition technology has been 
applied to the automatic recognition of handwritten text. John 
Makhoul described an extremely interesting demonstration by
Thad Starner and colleagues at BBN that "with essentially no 
modification, a speech recognition system can perform accurate 
on-line handwriting recognition". 
Starner and colleagues used conventional HMM techniques to 
recognize continuous cursive writing on a writer-independent 
basis. The features used for classification i cluded the temporal 
evolution of the writing angle and its derivative, as well as 
changes of pen position, and identified pen up/pen down events. 
Homologs for handwriting analysis were developed for the famil- 
iar phonetic models, representations of context dependencies, and 
statistical grammars. The system was trained and tested on written 
sentences derived from the ATIS and WSJ tasks. It was found that 
the use of both context and statistical grammar provided marked 
improvements to recognition accuracy. Observed word error rates 
were 1.1 percent for the 3050-word, 52-symbol ATIS task, and 
4.1 percent for the 25,000-word, 86-symbol WSJ task, using a 
version of BYBLOS with virtually no fine tuning for cursive 
handwriting. 
The work described by Rohini Srihari of SUNY Buffalo focuses 
on the improvement torecognition accuracy for handwriting that 
can be obtained by application of two rule-based and statistical 
syntactic analysis procedures. The first procedure isbased on the 
mutual information associated with word collocations within a 
phrase. The use of collocation information increased provided a
16.%percent relative decrease of errors among top-choice word 
candidates. Under some circumstances this information can also 
be used to insert highly-probable visually-confusible altemates to
the hypothesized words. The second approach made use a statisti- 
cal model of syntax based on part-of-speech (POS) tags. The 
results reconfirm that the use of statistical grammars can siguifi- 
candy improve recognition accuracy. 
The final paper of the Workshop, presented by Steve Lowe of 
Dragon Systems, concerned the use of large-vocabulary speech 
recognition systems to perform language identification, based on 
cumulated likelihood scores. To redoce the confounding variabil- 
ity introduced by differences in the quality of the acoustic match, 
normalized scores are obtained by dividing by the best-pessible 
acoustic score on a frame-by-frame basis. This strategy produced 
good results in performing English-Spanish discriminations for 
high-query speech in WSJ-type domain, but the results of subse- 
quent experiments using telephone speech and a less restricted 
domain were more ambiguous. It is believed that this approach 
remains apromising one and work is continuing on the topic.
