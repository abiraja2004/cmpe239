Abstract 
In this paper, we present a hybrid Chi-
nese language model based on a com-
bination of ontology with statistical 
method. In this study, we determined 
the structure of such a Chinese lan-
guage model. This structure is firstly 
comprised of an ontology description 
framework for Chinese words and a 
representation of Chinese lingual on-
tology knowledge. Subsequently, a 
Chinese lingual ontology knowledge 
bank is automatically acquired by de-
termining, for each word, its co-
occurrence with semantic, pragmatics, 
and syntactic information from the 
training corpus and the usage of Chi-
nese words will be gotten from lingual 
ontology knowledge bank for a actual 
document. To evaluate the performance 
of this language model, we completed 
two groups of experiments on texts re-
ordering for Chinese information re-
trieval and texts similarity computing. 
Compared with previous works, the 
proposed method improved the preci-
sion of nature language processing. 
1 Introduction 
Language modeling is a description of natural 
language and a good language model can help to 
improve the performance of the natural language 
processing. 
Traditional statistical language model 
(SLM) is fundamental to many natural language 
applications like automatic speech recognitionP[1]P, 
statistical machine translationP[2]P, and information 
retrievalP[3]P. Different statistical models have 
been proposed in the past, but n-gram models (in 
particular, bi-gram and tri-gram models) still 
dominate SLM research. After that, other ap-
proaches were put forward, such as the 
combination of statistical-based approach and 
rule-based approachP[4,5]P, self-adaptive language 
modelsP[6]P, topic-based model P[7]P and cache-based 
model P[8]P. But when the models are applied, the 
crucial disadvantages are that they can?t repre-
sent and process the semantic information of a 
natural language, so they can?t adapt well to the 
environment with changeful topics. 
Ontology was recognized as a conceptual 
modeling tool, which can descript an informa-
tion system in the semantic level and knowledge 
level. After it was first introduced in the field of 
Artificial IntelligenceP[9]P, it was closed combined 
with natural language processing and are widely 
applied in many field such as knowledge engi-
neering, digital library, information retrieval, 
semantic Web, and etc.  
In this paper, combining with the character-
istic of ontology and statistical method, we pre-
sent a hybrid Chinese language model. In this 
study, we determined the structure of Chinese 
language model and evaluate its performance 
with two groups of experiments on texts reorder-
ing for Chinese information retrieval and texts 
similarity computing. 
The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2, we describe the Chinese lan-
guage model. In section 3, we evaluate the 
language model by several experiments about 
natural language processing. In section 4, we 
present the conclusion and some future work. 
2 The language model description 
Traditional SLM is make use to estimate the 
likelihood (or probability) of a word string, in 
13
this study, we determined the structure of Chi-
nese language model, first, we gave the ontology 
description framework of Chinese word and the 
representation of Chinese lingual ontology 
knowledge, and then, automatically acquired the 
usage of a word with its co-occurrence of con-
text in using semantic, pragmatics, syntactic, etc 
from the corpus to act as Chinese lingual ontol-
ogy knowledge bank. In actual document, the 
usage of lingual knowledge will be gotten from 
lingual ontology knowledge bank. 
2.1   Ontology description framework 
Traditional ontology mainly emphasizes the 
interrelations between essential concept, domain 
ontology is a public concept set of this do-
main P[10]P. We make use of this to present Chinese 
lingual ontology knowledge bank. 
In practical application, ontology can be 
figured in many waysP[11]P, natural languages, 
frameworks, semantic webs, logical languages, 
etc. Presently, popular models, such as Ontolin-
gua, CycL and Loom, are all based on logical 
language. Though logical language has a strong 
expression, its deduction is very difficult to lin-
gual knowledge. Semantic web and natural lan-
guage are non-formal, which have disadvantages 
in grammar and expression. 
For a Chinese word, we provided a frame-
work structure that can be understood by com-
puter combined with WordNet, HowNet and 
Chinese Thesaurus. This framework includes a 
Chinese word in concept, part of speech (POS), 
semantic, synonyms, English translation. Fig-
ure1 shows the ontology description framework 
of a Chinese word.

2.2   Lingual ontology knowledge representation 
A word is the basic factor that composes the 
natural language, to acquire lingual ontology 
knowledge, we need to know POS, means and 
semantic of a word in a sentence. For example, 
for a Chinese sentence, the POS, means and 
Semantic label of ??? in HowNet are shown in 
table 1. For the Chinese sentence ??????
??????, after words segmented, POS tag-
ging and semantic tagging, we get a characteris-
tic string. They are shown in table 2.

sents not to be defined or exist this semantic in

In order to use and express easily, we gave 
a description for ontology knowledge of every 
Chinese word, which learned from corpus, to be 
shown as expression 1. All of them composed 
the Chinese lingual ontology knowledge bank.

2.3   Lingual ontology knowledge acquisition 
According to the course that human being ac-
quires and accumulates knowledge, we propose 
a measurable description for Chinese lingual 
ontology knowledge through automatically 
learning typical corpus. In this approach, we will 
acquire the usage of a Chinese word in semantic, 
pragmatic and syntactic in all documents. We 
combine with the multi-grams in context includ-
ing its co-occurrence, POS, semantic, synonym, 
position. In practical application, we will proc-
ess every Chinese keyword that has the same 
grammar expression, semantic representation 
and syntactic structure with Chinese lingual on-
tology knowledge bank. 
2.3.1   Algorithm of automatic acquisition 
Step 1: corpus pre-processing.  
For any Chinese document DBi B in the docu-
ment set {D}, we treat the sentence that includes 
keyword as a processing unit. First, we have a 
Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging, Se-
mantic label tagging based on HowNet, and then, 
confirm a word to act as the keyword for acquir-
ing its co-occurrence knowledge. We wipe off 
the word that can do little contribution to the 
lingual ontology knowledge, such as preposition, 
conjunction, auxiliary word and etc. 
Step 2: Unify the keyword. 
Making use of the ontology description of 
Chinese word, we make the synonym into uni-
form one. 
Step 3: Calculate the co-occurrence distance. 
In our proposal, first, we treat the sentence 
that includes keyword as a processing unit and 
make POS tagging, semantic label tagging, then, 
we get Characteristic string. We take the key-
word as the center, define the left and right dis-
tance factor B Bl B and B Br B to be shown at formula 1.

Where, m and n represent the left and right 
number of word that centered with the keyword. 
In this way, we try to get the language intuition, 
in a word, if the co-occurrence is nearer to the 
keyword, we will get more the co-occurrence 
distant. Final, we respectively get the left-side 
and right-side co-occurrence distant from key-
word to its co-occurrence to be shown as for-
mula 2.

Step4: Calculate the average co-occurrence 
distance. 
For a keyword, in the current sentence of 
document DBi,B we regard the keyword and its co-
occurrence (SemBi B, POS Bi B, L) as semantic relation 
pair, and CBjB is their co-occurrence distance. We 
calculate the average of CBjB that appear in corpus 
and act as the average co-occurrence distance 
lC  
between the keyword and its co-occurrence 
(SemBi B, POS Bi B, L). 
When all of documents are learned, all of 
keyword and their co-occurrence information ( )iii CLPOSSem ,,,  compose the Chinese lingual 
ontology knowledge bank. 
Step 5: Rebuild the index. 
In order to improve the processing speed, 
for acquired lingual ontology knowledge bank, 
we first build an index according to Chinese 
word, and then, we respectively make a sorting 
according to the semantic label SemBi B for every 
Chinese word. 
2.3.2 Lingual ontology knowledge application 
In practical application, we will respectively get 
different evaluation of a document from the lin-
gual ontology knowledge bank. For the natural 
language processing, e.g. documents similarity 
computing, text re-ranking for information re-
trieval, information filtering, the general proc-
essing is as follow. 
Step 1: Pre-processing and unify the key-
word. 
The processing is the same as Step 1 and 
Step 2 in section 2.3.1. 
Step 2: Fetch the average co-occurrence 
distance from lingual ontology knowledge bank. 
We regard a sentence including keyword in 
document D as a processing unit. First, we make 
POS tagging, semantic label tagging and get 
Characteristic string, and then, for every key-
word, if it has the same semantic relation pair as 
lingual ontology knowledge bank, i.e. the key-
word and its co-occurrence (SemBi B, POS Bi B, L) in 
practical document is the same one as lingual 
15
ontology knowledge bank, we add up all the 
average co-occurrence distance 
lC  from Chinese 
lingual ontology knowledge bank acquired in 
section 2.3.1. 
Step 3: Get the evaluation value of a docu-
ment. 
Repeat Step 2 until all keywords be proc-
essed and the accumulation of the average co-
occurrence distance 
lC will act as the evaluation 
value of current document. 
3 Evaluation of language model 
We completed two groups of experiments on 
text re-ranking for information retrieval, text 
similarity computing to verify the performance 
of lingual ontology knowledge. 
3.1   Texts reordering 
Information retrieval is used to retrieve relevant 
documents from a large document set for a user 
query, where the user query can be a simple de-
scription by natural. As a general rule, users 
hope more to acquire relevant information from 
the top ranking documents, so they concern 
more on the precision of top ranking documents 
than the recall. 
We use the Chinese document set CIRB011 
(132,173 documents) and CIRB020 (249,508 
documents) from NTCIR3 CLIR dataset and 
select 36 topics from 50 search topics (see 
http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir-ws3/work-en.html 
for more information) to evaluate our method. 
We use the same method to retrieve documents 
mentioned by Yang LingpengP[12]P, i.e. we use 
vector space model to retrieve documents, use 
cosine to calculate the similarity between docu-
ment and user query. We respectively use bi-
grams and words as indexing unitsP[13,14]P, the av-
erage precision of top N ranking documents acts 
as the normal results. In this paper, we used a 
Chinese dictionary that contains about 85,000 
items to segment Chinese document and query. 
To measure the effectiveness of informa-
tion retrieval, we use the same two kinds of 
relevant measures: relax-relevant and rigid-
relevantP[14,15]P. A document is rigid-relevant if it?s 
highly relevant or relevant with user query, and 
a document is relax-relevant if it is high relevant 
or relevant or partially relevant with user query. 
We also use PreAt10 and PreAt100 to represent 
the precision of top 10 ranking documents and 
top 100 ranking documents. 
3.1.1   Strategy of texts reordering 
First, we get some keywords to every topic by 
query description. For example, 
Title: ????? (The birth of a cloned 
calf) 
Description: ????????????
?????????????? (Find Arti-
cles relating to the birth of cloned calves using 
the technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer) 
We extract ???, ???, ??, ???
?? as feature word in this topic. 
Second, acquire lingual ontology knowl-
edge every topic by their feature words. In this 
proposal, we arrange 300 Chinese texts of this 
topic as learning corpus to get lingual ontology 
knowledge bank. 
Third, get the evaluation value of every text 
about this topic, i.e. respectively add up all the 
average co-occurrence distance lC  to the same 
semantic relation pairs in every text from lingual 
ontology knowledge bank.  
If a text has several keywords, repeat step3 
to acquire every evaluation value to these key-
words, and then, add up each evaluation value to 
act as the text evaluation value. 
Final, we reorder the initial retrieval texts 
according to the every text evaluation value of 
every topic. 
3.1.2   Experimental results and analysis 
We calculate the evaluation value of every text 
in each topic to reorder the initial relevant 
documents. 
Table 3 lists the normal results and our re-
sults based on bi-gram indexing, our results are 
acquired based on Chinese lingual ontology 
knowledge to enhance the effectiveness. 
PreAt10 is the average precision of 36 topics in 
precision of top 10 ranking documents, while 
PreAt100 is top 100 ranking documents. 
Table 4 lists the normal results and our re-
sults based on word indexing. Ratio displays an 
increase ratio of our result compared with nor-
mal result. 
Table 3. Precision (bi-gram as indexing unit) 
Items Normal Our method Ratio 
PreAt10 (Relax) 0.3704 0.4389 18.49% 
PreAt100 (Relax) 0.1941 0.2239 15.35% 
PreA10 (Rigid) 0.2625 0.3083 17.45% 
PreAt100 (Rigid) 0.1312 0.1478 12.65% 
16
Table 4. Precision (word as indexing unit) 
Items Normal Our method Ratio 
PreAt10 (Relax) 0.3829 0.4481 17.03% 
PreAt100 (Relax) 0.2022 0.2306 14.05% 
PreAt10 (Rigid) 0.2745 0.3169 15.45% 
PreAt100 (Rigid) 0.1405 0.1573 11.96% 
In table 3, it is shown that compared with 
bi-grams as indexing units, our method respec-
tively increases 18.49% in relax relevant meas-
ure and 17.45% in rigid in PreAt10. In PreAt100 
level, our method respectively increases 15.35% 
in relax relevant and 12.65% in rigid relevant 
measure. Figure 3 displays the PreAt10 values 
of each topic in relax relevant measure based on 
bi-gram indexing where one denotes the preci-
sion enhanced with our method, another denotes 
the normal precision. It is shown the precision of 
each topic is all improved by using our method. 
 
Fig. 3. PreAt10 of all topics in relax judgment 
In table 4, using words as indexing units, 
our method respectively increases 17.03% in 
relax relevant measure and 15.45% in rigid in 
PreAt10. In PreAt100 level, our method respec-
tively increases 14.05% in relax relevant meas-
ure and 11.96% in rigid. 
In our experiments, compared with the two 
Chinese indexing units: bi-gram and words, our 
method increases the average precision of all 
queries in top 10 and top 100 measure levels for 
about 17.1% and 13.5%. What lies behind our 
method is that for each topic, we manually select 
some Chinese corpus to acquire the lingual on-
tology knowledge, and can help us to focus on 
relevant documents. Our experiment also shows 
improper extract and corpus may decrease the 
precision of top documents. So our method de-
pends on right keywords in texts, queries and the 
corpus. 
3.2   Text similarity computing 
Text similarity is a measure for the matching 
degree between two or more texts, the more high 
the similarity degree is, the more the meaning of 
text expressing is closer, vice versa. Some pro-
posal methods include Vector Space Model P[16]P, 
Ontology-based P[17]P, Distributional Semantics 
model P[18]P. 
3.2.1   Strategy of similarity computation 
First, for two Chinese texts DBiB and DBjB, we re-
spectively extract k same feature words, if the 
same feature words in the two texts is less than k, 
we don?t compare their similarity. 
Second, acquire lingual ontology knowl-
edge every text by their feature words. 
Third, get the evaluation value of every text, 
i.e. respectively add up all the average co-
occurrence distance 
lC  to the same semantic 
relation pairs in two texts. 
Final, compute the similarity ratio of every 
two text DBi B and DBj B. The similarity ratio equals to 
the ratio of the similarity evaluation value of 
text DBi B and DBj B, if the ratio is in the threshold ?, 
then we think that text DBi B is similar to text DBj B. 
3.2.2   Experimental results and analysis 
We download four classes of text for testing 
from Sina, Yahoo, Sohu and Tom, which in-
clude 71 current affairs news, 68 sports news, 69 
IT news, 74 education news. 
For the test of current affairs texts, accord-
ing to the strategy of similarity computation, we 
choose five words as feature word. They are ??
?, ??, ??, ??, ???. In the texts, the 
word ???, ??? are all replaced by word ??
?? and other classes are similar. The testing 
result is shown in table 5.  
Table 5. Testing results for text similarity 
0.95<?<1.05 0.85<?<1.15 Items

IT news 93.75% 96.77% 95.24% 91.18% 100% 95.39% 
Education news 94.74% 97.30% 96.00% 90.24 100% 94.87% 
General results 93.57% 95.62% 94.58% 90.07% 99.27% 94.42% 
 
17
We analyzed all the experimental results to 
find that the results for current affairs texts are 
the best, while the sports texts are lower than 
others. We think it is mainly because some 
sports terms are unprofessional for the lower 
sports texts recognition, such as ????, ??, 
???. Other feature words are more fixed and 
more concentrated. 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented a hybrid Chinese 
language model based on a combination of on-
tology with statistical method. We discuss the 
modeling and evaluate its performance. In the 
test about texts reordering, our experiences show 
that our method can increase the performance of 
Chinese information retrieval about 17.1% and 
13.5% at top 10 and top 100 documents measure 
level. In another test about texts similarity com-
puting, F1-measure is above 95%. 
On the other hand, in the current disposal 
of our information processing, we only make 
use of some characteristics ontology and use 
some co-occurrence information, such as seman-
tics, POS, context, position, distance, and etc. 
For the further research and experiment, we will 
be on the following: (1) Research on the charac-
teristics of relations between semantics and 
combine with some mature natural language 
processing techniques. (2) Research traditional 
ontology representation to keep up with interna-
tional stand. (3) Apply our key techniques to 
English information retrieval and cross-lingual 
information retrieval systems and study a 
general approach.
