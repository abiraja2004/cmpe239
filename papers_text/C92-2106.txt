C, honasky's proposition that language is handled hy a 
language-specific laeulty needs more justi|ieation. In 
language acquisition ill i)artieular, it is still in ques- 
tion whether the faculty is necessary or aot. We suc- 
ceeded in explaining one eonstrainl oil language ac- 
quisition in terms of a general earning mechanism. 
This paper describes a machine learning system Rhea 
applied to the domain of language acquisition and 
shows that Rhea call learn the tendency which chil- 
dren conf ront ing  lie',',' words Seelll to llave. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Chomsky proposed that language is handled by a 
language specilic faculty, but this proposition has 
not been verified, especially ill the area of  lan 
guage acquisili(:)n. Although Berwick\[1\] showed 
tile existence of a special nlechanisnl sulfirielfl for 
the learning of syntax, there is still a question of 
whether or not the I l lecha.tl lslB iS l leCessary,  l?lll "- 
therlnore, his model does not explain acquisition 
of setnantics or eoncepis. These were simply pre- 
supposed. 
We started froln a geimral k!arning mecha - 
niSlll alld succeeded ill explainiug a constraint 
on language acquisition. 
Children learldng their ill'st language face 
and solve a big prol)hun of induction. They lind 
(:)lit \]lOW words  &l'e ased  all(\] ) 'e lated Ic, o ther  
words from lilni(ed informal\[on at a surprisingly 
ra.pid rate. Ill tim fieM of (leveli)pmental psychol- 
ogy, many kinds of constraints have been pro 
posed to accounl for this I>henonten(m. Most of 
these constraints (:olne froln the view that as 
sunles a specific fl'anlework far language acquisi 
tion, but there is altother view: language as an 
extension of other intellectuaJ faculties, and its 
acquisition as one resnlt of the universal learning 
process  that leads to (mr acquisition of intellect. 
We want to explain the children's ability ill 
terms of tile latter view. '\['hus, we make a 
machine learning systenl, Rhea, which arcepts 
n-luple illplltS elms\[sting of instances f ro ln it. 
donlains (one from each (IonlaJn) and creates 
the rules that delilnil the imssibh , torah\[nations. 
This framework b, very ~;eeera\[, and yet i\[" we 
choose (mi(:,r wc.'lds and lingl, islic des('riplions 
for thetil as tWO input donlains, it can be seen as 
a language arquisilion system without language 
specific constraints. 
In this paper, we describe lhe nm<'hine 
h,arnin~ syslenl Rhea an(l its applicali<n: to Ihe 
donlain of language artluisition. We show \[hal

The imim is how the model aeqlfir~,~ and 
tormalizes the "meaning" of an expression. To 
achiew, this aut(:mOrlmusly, Rhea has its own rep 
resenlati(m language for outer-worlds. If one lin 
guistir expression is repeatedly given along wilh 
(tifli, renl otHer-worlds, it builds up one ('OmnlOtl

8 An overv iew of Rhea 
3.1 Rhea  as a mach ine  learn ing  sys -  
tem 
Fig.1 i l lustrates Rhea's learning process in 
two dif\[erent domains, A and B. The system's 
task is to find general rules that predict which in- 
stance from l)olltain A can at(pear with a certain 
instal'tee front B, and vice versa. 
Rhea accepts as input a \[)air of instances 
i = (a,b). One instance is fronl l)omain A an(1 
the other front l)omain B. One pair is given at 
a time. Rhea is equipped with an internal repre- 
sentation language for each domain, D.4 and De, 
and has predelined methods to extend the repro- 
sentation languages in case of nee(l. Sindlarities, 
generalization operations and specialization op- 
erations are defined upon ea<,h language. Rhea 
represents all input pair using these languages 
and their extensions, anti makes all internal 'et - 
resentation D(i) - (1)A(a), De(b)}, which is a 
pab" of a representation of" I)olnain A instan(:e 
att(I that  of a l)omaill H instance. More tha.ll one 
possible internal representation may exist for one 
input, but the one found first is stored. 
When represelltations are acctHlflulated, R hea 
is able to find out rules, h tirst sorts intert~al 
representations into classes based on similarities. 
Classes nlay or may not overlap. Then Rhea gen- 
eralizes representations of' each ('lass. This pro- 
cess of <`lassili('ation a d generalizatiol~ is, done 
oil demand. 
When a partial input , (an instan<`e frotn l)o- 
main A) is given and its <`otlnterpart b (front l)o 
nmizl B) is to he predlcte(I, tilt, ntodel first (:las

l)omain |l part ttf all the other reltresentalions 
ill <'\]ass :',: and expects one of its spe('ializalions 
to he b's rt,presentalion l)B(b). 
The nmdel \[ortns classes o that reF.resenta- 
lions in ea(:h (:lass share sortie characteristics. 
Two internal representations, ( l ) , t (a \ ] ) ,  l)h,(bj )) 
an(l (l)A(a;\])~ I)B(b2)), belong to ihe same class 
if DA(al)  and DA(a2 ) are sinli lar in the trite+

and l)B(bl) an(l I)B(b2) are also sindlar it\] the

7 D iscuss ion  
7.1 Semant ic  concepts  and  input  
Other acquisition models Ihal cover semantic 
acquisition are the syslem of Takagi el. al. 
\[4\], which accepts a sentence and visual input, 
Hill's language acquisition tnodel\[5\] and Self- 
ridge's Ctl ILI)\[@ llowever these models as- 
sunte semantic oncepts front the slarl, and their 
task is to associate linguistic entities with thetrt. 
These systems, which receive a sentantic COtlCel)l 
to be associated with a linguistic expression as 
direct input, c81111ol 'ntisundersland I he tncaning 
of a linguistic expres:slon and cannot she(l light 
Oil tilt> difficulty of learnirtg the meaning of a cer 
tain expression. 
'~'Ve do llOt a~%Sl=lllle senlal l t ic  ?OIl(;epts in rep- 
resent ing  scenes given to Rhea. We formalize 
concepts as filnctions fi'onl the direct input to 
FOAs. They must |)e fi:)rnted and 1ested in ac 
corda.nee with expressions anti other concepts. 
We eqltiptled the model with filter=priutitives, 
which are means ofeslal>lishing the concepts. We 
have designed filler-i>ritnitives to I)ecome equiv- 
alents of human abilities of recognitlotl, l"ilter- 
printitives are given fi'onl the beginning I)ecause 
human beings have the abilily to focus 1heir at- 
tention Oil objects, attributes or changes when 
they begin language acquisilion. Rhea can se+ 
loot a \ [ )a rameler  f olll scelles alld make  coi lcrete 
lilter-elentents just like any child coming 1o dis- 
tinguish imtmrtanl features in its world. There 
ft)re, our formalization of con(:et)ts and its acqui- 
silioll process is a more realistic Olle. 
7.2 Acqu is i t ion  o f  a const ra in t  
The principle of contrasl is deriw,d from the gen 
eral constraint on how a (:lass shouhl I)e fortned 
to make useful l)rediclions, and as shown in sec 
tion 6, Rhea has no language-specifh: constraints 
but yel can acquire tile "setting for new words", 
because its \[ilterq)rimitives and classification cri- 
teria can tel)reduce the tendency thai was con- 
tained in the input pairs. 
Ill Ollt' experi l l le l l t ,  the one-word SelltellCeS 
given to llhea were often laxononli(' terms or at- 
tributes of any oltjecls in the scene and Rhea 
learned thai the best conjecture is that the one- 
word sentence presented with unknown objects 
refers lo ;i taxonomJ(; ieri'll of the lltOSt frequently 
describe<l objecl. If we give a label for the biggest 
oil jeer ill the SCell(! whelleyer llhea llleel~s a scefle 
with muhiple objects lhal are not yel laheled, 
Rhea will make a tiller of a cal.egory that sorts 
el)jeers I)y size and exlracls l.he \[irsl one. Our 
claim is thai chihh'en can also acquire the "sel- 
ting for the new words" fi'om a few inputs of 
olle-wor(t selllellces, ~lll(I thai it lleed llOl to I)e 
set a priori. 
8 Conc lus ion  
This paper ha+'+ described Rhea, the model of lan- 
guage aequisillou, which uses wwy general aC<lui- 
sition procedure. We assume neither semantic 
concept..,+ nor syntacli(' rules a priori, lnsiead, 
we have equipped the model with the general 
franlework to create the rules thai delimit tilt, 
possible conlhinatious of the input. We applied 
the model to the (Ic,1llaillS of Otlter-wt:q'l(Is alld 
linguistic descriplions of thent. The svsleIll Silk'- 
cessfully made concepts that are consistent with 
giwm inputs. "\['he experinlenl showed that il 
reproduced the "setting for lhe new words," a 
human lendency in language acquisition, with- 
out language-specific constraints or inforntation 
aS(mr hmv ouler worhls are orgattized.
