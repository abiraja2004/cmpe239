Abst ract  
Human face-to-face onversation is an ideal model 
for human-computer dialogue. One of the major 
features of face-to-face ommunication is its multi- 
plicity of communication channels that act on mul- 
tiple modalities. To realize a natural multimodal 
dialogue, it is necessary to study how humans per- 
ceive information and determine the information 
to which humans are sensitive. A face is an in- 
dependent communication channel that conveys 
emotional and conversational signals, encoded as 
facial expressions. We have developed an experi- 
mental system that integrates speech dialogue and 
facial animation, to investigate the effect of intro- 
ducing communicative facial expressions as a new 
modality in human-computer conversation. Our 
experiments have showen that facial expressions 
are helpful, especially upon first contact with the 
system. We have also discovered that featuring 
facial expressions at an early stage improves ub- 
sequent interaction. 
In t roduct ion  
Human face-to-face onversation is an ideal nmdel 
for human-computer dialogue. One of the major 
features of face-to-face communication is its mul- 
tiplicity of communication channels that act on 
multiple modalities. A channel is a communica- 
tion medium associated with a particular encod- 
ing method. Examples are the auditory channel 
(carrying speech) and the visual channel (carry- 
ing facial expressions). A modality is the sense 
used to perceive signals from the outside world. 
Many researchers have been developing mul- 
timodal dialogue systems. In some cases, re- 
searchers have shown that information in one 
channel complements or modifies information in 
another. As a simple example, the phrase "delete 
it" involves the coordination of voice with ges- 
ture. Neither makes ense without the other. Re- 
searchers have also noticed that nonverbal (ges- 
ture or gaze) information plays a role in set- 
ting the situational context which is useful in re- 
stricting the hypothesis pace constructed ur- 
ing language processing. Anthropomorphic inter- 
faces present another approach to nmltimodal di- 
alogues. An anthropomorphic interface, such as 
Guides \[Don et al, 1991\], provides a means to 
realize a new style of interaction. Such research 
attempts to computationally capture the commu- 
nicative power of the human face and apply it to 
human-computer dialogue. 
Our research is closely related to the last ap- 
proach. The aim of this research is to improve 
human-computer dialogue by introducing human- 
like behavior into a speech dialogue system. Such 
behavior will include factors uch as facial expres- 
sions and head and eye movement. It will help to 
reduce any stress experienced by users of comput- 
ing systems, lowering the complexity associated 
with understanding system status. 
Like most dialogue systems developed by nat- 
ural language researchers, our current system can 
handle domain-dependent, i formation-seeking di- 
alogues. Of course, the system encounters prob- 
lems with ambiguity and missing intbrmation (i.e., 
anaphora nd ellipsis). The system tries to re- 
solve them using techniques from natural language 
understanding (e.g., constraint-based, case-based. 
and plan-based methods). We are also studying 
the use of synergic multimodality to resolve lin- 
guistic problems, as in conventional multimodal 
systems. This work will bc reported in a separate 
publication. 
In this paper, we concentrate on the role 
of nonverbal nlodality for increasing flexibility of 
human-computer dialogue and reducing the men- 
tal barriers that many users associate with com- 
puter systems.

D ia logues  
Multimodal dialogues that combine verbal and 
nonverbal communication have been pursued 
102 
mainly from the following three viewpoints. 
1. Combining direct manipulation with natural an- 
guage (deictic) expressions 
"Direct manipulation (DM)" was suggested by 
Shneiderinan \[1983\]. The user can interact di- 
rectly with graphical objects displayed on the 
computer screen with rapid, iNcremeNtal, re- 
versible operations whose effects on the objects 
of interest are immediately visible. 
The semantics of natural language (NL) ex- 
pressions is anchored to real-world objects and 
events by means of pointing and demoNstratiNg 
actions and deictic expressions such as "this," 
"that," "here," "there," "theN," and "now." 
Some research on dialogue systems has coin- 
bined deictic gestures aNd natural anguage such 
as Put-That-There \[Bolt, 1980\], CUBRICON 
\[Neal et al, 1988\], and ALFREsco \[Stock, 1991\]. 
One of the advantages of combined NL/DM in- 
teraction is that it can easily resolve the miss- 
ing information in NL expressions. For exam- 
ple, wheN the system receives a user request in 
speech like "delete that object," it can fill in the 
missing information by looking for a pointing 
gesture from the user or objects on the screen 
at the time the request is made. 
2. Using nonverbal inputs to specify the ;~ontext 
and filter out unrelated information 
The focus of attention or the focal point plays 
a very important role in processing applications 
with a broad hypothesis pace such as speech 
recognition. One example of focusing modality 
is following the user's looking behavior. Fixa- 
tion or gaze is useful for the dialogue system 
to determine the context of the user's inter- 
est. For example, when a user is looking at 
a car, that the user says at that time may be 
related to the car. Prosodic information (e.g., 
voice tones) in the user's utterance also helps 
to determine focus. In this case, the system 
uses prosodic information to infer the user's be- 
liefs Or intentions. Combining estural informa- 
tion with spoken language comprehension shows 
another example of how context may be deter- 
mined by the user's nonverbal behavior \[Ovi- 
att et al, 1993\]. This research uses multimodal 
forms that prompt a user to speak or write into 
labeled fields. The forms are capable of guiding 
and segmenting inputs, of conveying the kind of 
information the system is expecting, and of re- 
ducing ambiguities in utterances by restricting 
syntactic and semantic omplexities. 
3. Incorporating human-like behavior into dialogue 
systems to reduce operation complexity and 
stress often associated with computer systems 
Designing human-computer dialogue requires 
that the computer makes appropriate backchan- 
nel feedbacks like NoddiNg or expressions such 
as "aha" and "I see." One of the major ad- 
vantages of using such nonverbal behavior in 
human-computer conversation is that reactions 
are quicker than those fl'om voice-based re- 
spouses. For example, the facial backchannel 
plays an important role in hulnan face-to-face 
conversation. We consider such quick reac- 
tions as being situated actions \[Suchman, 1987\] 
which are necessary for resource-bounded dia- 
logue participants. Timely responses are crucial 
to successfid conversation, since some delay in 
reactions can imply specific meanings or make 
messages unnecessarily ambiguous. 
Generally, visual channels contribute to quick 
user recognition of system status. For example, 
the system's gaze behavior (head and eye move- 
meat) gives a strong impression of whether it 
is paying attention or not. If the system's eyes 
wander around aimlessly, the user easily recog- 
nizes the system's attention elsewhere, perhaps 
even unaware that he or she is speaking to it. 
Thus, gaze is an important indicator of system 
(in this case, speech recognition) status. 
By using human-like nonverbal behavior, the 
system can more flexibly respond to the user 
than is possible by using verbal modality alone. 
We focused on the third viewpoint and devel- 
oped a system that acts like a human. We em- 
ployed communicative facial expressions as a new 
modality in human-computer conversation. We 
have already discussed this, however, in another 
paper \[Takeuchi and Nagao, 1993\]. Here, we con- 
sider our implemented system as a testbed for in- 
corporating human-like (nonverbal) behavior into 
dialogue systems. 
The following sections give a system overview, 
an example dialogue along with a brief explanation 
of the process, and our experimental results.

Facial Displays as a New Modal i ty  
The study of facial expressions has attracted the 
interest of a number of different disciplines, in- 
cluding psychology, ethology, and interpersonal 
communications. Currently, there are two basic 
schools of thought. One regards facial expres- 
sions as beiu~ expressioNs of emotion \[Ekman and 
Friesen, 1984\]. The other views facial expressions 
in a social context, regarding them as being com- 
municative signals \[Chovil, 1991\]. The term "fa- 
cial displays" is essentially the same as "facial ex- 
pressions," but is less reminiscent of emotion. In 
this paper, therefore, we use "facial displays." 
103 
A face is an independent communication chan- 
nel that conveys emotional and conversational sig- 
nals, encoded as facial displays. Facial displays 
can be also regarded as being a modality because 
the human brain has a special circuit dedicated to 
their processing. 
Table 1 lists all the communicative facial dis- 
plays used in the experiments described in a later 
section. The categorization framework, terminol- 
ogy, and individual displays are based on the work 
of Chovil \[1991\], with the exception of the em- 
phasizer, underliner, and facial shrug. These were 
coined by Ekman \[1969\].

Three major categories are defined as follows. 
Syntact i c  displays.  These are facial displays 
that (1) place stress on particular words or clauses, 
(2) are connected with the syntactic aspects of an 
utterance, or (3) are connected with the organiza- 
tion of the talk. 
Speaker  displays.  Speaker displays are facial 
displays that (1) illustrate the idea being verbally 
conveyed, or (2) add additional information to the 
ongoing verbal content. 
L is tener  comment  displays.  These are facial 
displays made by the person who is not speaking, 
in response to the utterances of the speaker. 
An  In tegrated  System o f  Speech  
D ia logue  and  Fac ia l  An imat ion  
We have developed an experimental system that 
integrates speech dialogue and facial animation to 
investigate the effects of human-like behavior in 
human-computer dialogue. 
The system consists of two subsystems, a fa- 
cial animation subsystem that generates a three- 
dimensional face capable of a range of facial dis- 
plays, and a speech dialogue subsystem that rec- 
ognizes and interprets peech, and generates voice 
outputs. Currently, the animation subsystem runs 
on an SGI 320VGX and the speech dialogue sub- 
system on a Sony NEWS workstation. These two 
subsystems communicate with each other via an 
Ethernet network. 
Figure 1 shows the configuration of tlle inte- 
grated system. Figure 2 illustrates the interaction 
of a user with the system.

The face is modeled three-dimensionally. Our cur- 
rent version is composed of approximately 500 
polygons. The face can be rendered with a skin- 
like surface material, by applying a texture map 
taken from a photograph or a video frame. 
In 3D computer graphics, a facial display is 
realized by local deformation of the polygons rep- 
resenting the face. Waters showed that deforma- 
tion that simulates the action of muscles under- 
lying the face looks more natural \[Waters, 1987\]. 
We therefore use munerical equations to simulate 
muscle actions, as defined by Waters. Currently,

the system incorporates 16 muscles and 10 pa- 
rameters, controlling mouth opening, jaw rotation, 
eye movement, eyelid oI)ening, and head orienta- 
tion. These 16 nmscles were deternfined by Wa- 
ters, considering the correspondence with action 
units in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) 
\[Ekman and Friesen. 1978\]. For details of the fa- 
cial modeling and animation system, see \[Takeuchi 
and Franks, 1992\]. 
We use 26 synthesized facial displays, corre- 
sponding to those listed in Table 1, and two ad- 
ditional displays. All facial displays are generated 
by the above method, and rendered with a texture 
map of a young boy's face. The added displays 
are "Smile" and "Neutral." The "Neutral" display 
features no muscle contraction whatsoever, and is 
used when no conversational signal is needed. 
At run-time, the animation subsystem awaits 
a request fi'om the speech subsystem. When the 
animation subsystem receives a request hat spec- 
ifies values for the 26 parameters, it starts to de- 
form the face, on the basis of the received values. 
The deformation process is controlled by the dif- 
ferential equation ff = a - f ,  where f is a param- 
eter value at time t and f '  is its time derivative 
at time t. a is the target value specified in the 
request,. A feature of this equation is that defor- 
mation is fast in the early phase but soon slows, 
corresponding closely to the real dynamics of fa- 
cial displays. Currently, the base performance of 
the animation subsystem is around 20-25 frames 
per second when running on an SGI Power Series. 
This is sufficient o enable real-time animation. 
Speech Dialogue Subsystem 
Our speech dialogue subsystem works as follows. 
First, a voice input is acoustically analyzed by a 
built-in sound processing board. Then, a speech 
recognition module is invoked to output word se- 
quences that have been assigned higher scores by 
a probabilistic phoneme model. These word se- 
quen(:es are syntactically and semantically ana- 
lyzed and disambiguated by applying a relatively 
loose grammar and a restricted omain knowledge. 
Using a semantic representation of the input ut- 
terance, a I)lan recognition module extracts the 
speaker's intention. For example, ti'om the ut- 
terance "I am interested in Sony's workstation." 
the module interprets the speaker's intention as 
"he wants to get precise information about Sony's 
workstation." Once the system deternfines the 
speaker's intention, a response generation module 
is invoked. This generates a response to satisfy the 
speaker's request. Finally, the system's response is
output as voice by a voice synthesis module. This 
module also sends the information about lip syn- 
chronization that describes phonemes (including 
silence) in the response and their time durations 
to the facial animation subsystem. 
With the exception of the voice synthesis nmd- 
ule, each nmdule can send messages to the facial 
animation subsystem to request he generation of 
a facial display. The relation between the speech 
dialogues and facial displays is discussed later. 
In this case, the specific task of the system 
is to provide information about Sony's computer- 
related products. For example, the system can an- 
swer questions about price, size, weight, and spec- 
ifications of Sony's workstations and PCs. 
Below, we describe the modules of the speech 
diMogue subsystem. 
Speech recogni t ion .  This module was jointly 
developed with the ElectrotechnicM Laboratory 
and Tokyo Institute of Technology. Speaker- 
independent continuous speech inputs are ac- 
cepted without special hardware. To obtain a 
high level of accuracy, context-dependent pho- 
netic hidden Marker models are used to construct 
phoneme-level hypotheses \[Itou et al. 1992\]. This 
nmdule can generate N-best word-level hypothe- 
ses. 
Syntact i c  and semant ic  analysis.  This mod- 
ule consists of a parsing n~echanism, a semantic 
analyzer, a relatively loose grammar consisting of 
24 rules, a lexicon that includes 34 nouns. 8 verbs. 
4 adjectives and 22 particles, and a fl'ame-based 
knowledge base consisting of 61 conceptual frames. 
Our semantic analyzer can handle ambiguities in 
syntactic structures and generates a semantic rep- 
resentation of the speaker's utterance. We ap- 
plied a preferential constraint satisfaction tech- 
nique \[Nagao, 1992\] for perfornfing disambigua- 
tion and semantic analysis. By allowing the prefer- 
ences to control the application of the constraints. 
105 
ambiguities can be efficiently resolved, thus avoid- 
ing combinatorial explosions. 
P lan  recogni t ion .  This module determines the 
speaker's intention by constructing a model of 
his/her beliefs, dynamically adjusting and expand- 
ing the model as the dialogue progresses \[Nagao, 
1993\]. The model deals with the dynamic nature 
of dialogues by applying the following two mech- 
anisms. First, preferences among the contexts are 
dynamically computed based on the facts and as- 
sumptions within each context. The preference 
provides a measure of the plausibility of a context. 
The currently most preferable context contains a 
currently recognized plan. Secondly, changing the 
most plausible context among mutually exclusive 
contexts within a dialogue is formally treated as 
belief revision of a plan-recognizing agent. How- 
ever, in some dialogues, many alternatives may 
have very similar preference values. In this situ- 
ation, one may wish to obtain additional infor- 
mation, allowing one to be more certain about 
committing to the preferable context. A crite- 
rion for detecting such a critical situation based 
on the preference measures for mutually exclusive 
contexts is being explored. The module also main- 
tains the topic of the current dialogue and can han- 
dle anaphora (reference of pronouns) and ellipsis 
(omission of subjects). 
Response  generat ion .  This module generates a 
response by using domain knowledge (database) 
and text templates (typical patterns of utter- 
ances). It selects appropriate templates and com- 
bines them to construct a response that satisfies 
the speaker's request. 
In our prototype system, the method used to 
comprehend speech is a specific combination of 
specific types of knowledge sources with a rather 
fixed information flow, preventing flexible inter- 
action between them. A new method that en- 
ables flexible control of omni-directional informa- 
tion flow in a very context-sensitive fashion has 
been announced \[Nagao et al, 19931. Its archi- 
tecture is based on dynamical constraint \[Hasida 
et al, 19931 which defines a fine classification 
based on the dimensions of satisfaction and the vi- 
olation of constraints. A constraint is represented 
in terms of a clausal ogic program. A fine-grained 
declarative semantics i defined for this constraint 
by measuring the degree of violation in terms of 
real-valued potential energy. A field of force arises 
along the gradient of this energy, inferences be- 
ing controlled on the basis of the dynamics. This 
allows us to design combinatorial behaviors un- 
der declarative semantics within tractable com- 
putational complexity. Our forthcoming system 
can, therefore, concentrate on its computational 
resources according to a dynamic focal point that 
is important o speech processing with broad by- 
pothesis pace, and apply every kind of constraint, 
from phonetic to pragmatic, at the same time. 
Cor respondence  between 
Conversat iona l  S i tuat ions  and  Facial 
Displays 
The speech dialogue subsystem recognizes a num- 
ber of typical conversational situations that are 
important o dialogues. We associate these situ- 
ations with an appropriate facial display(s). For 
example, in situations where speech input is not 
recognized or where it is syntactically invalid, the 
listener comment display "Not confident" is dis- 
played. If the speaker's request exceeds the range 
of the system's domain knowledge, then the sys- 
tem displays a facial shrug and replies "I cannot 
answer such a question." The relationships be- 
tween conversational situations and facial displays 
are listed in Table 2.

U2 is an example of noisy inputs. The system 
could not recognize the expression and displayed 
the facial backchannel NotConfident and replied "I 
beg your pardon." In U3, there is missing infor- 
mation about personal computer maker. So, the 
system enters a clarification dialogue $4, showing 
the Question display. In this case, the system tried 
to drive the user into the domMn with which the 
system is familiar. However, the user refused to 
agree with the system by utterance U4, then the 
system revealed its discouragement by showing a 
facial shrug. In US, the user changes the topic, by 
asking for workstation information. The system 
recognizes this by comparison with the prior topic 
(i.e., personal computers). Therefore, in response 
to question S l l ,  the system displays EOStory and 
subsequently BOStory to indicate the shift to a 
different opic. The system also manages the topic 
structure so that it can handle anaphora nd el- 
lipsis in utterances such as ug ,  UIO, and U l l .  
Exper imenta l  Resu l ts  
To examine the effect of facial displays on the in- 
teraction between humans and computers, exper- 
iments were performed using the prototype sys- 
tem. The system was tested on 32 volunteer sub- 
jects. Two experiments were prepared. In one 
experiment, called F, the subjects held a conver- 
sation with the system, which used facial displays 
to reinforce its response. In the other experiment, 
called N, the subjects held a conversation with 
the system, which answered using short phrases 
instead of facial displays. The short phrases were 
two- or three-word sentences that described the 
corresponding facial displays. For example, in- 
stead of the "Not confident" display, it simply 
displayed the words "I am not confident." The 
subjects were divided into two groups, FN and 
NF.  As the names indicate, the subjects in the 
FN group were first subjected to experiment F 
and then N. The subjects in the NF  group were 
first subjected to N and then F. In both experi- 
ments, the subjects were assigned the goal of en- 
107 
quiring about the functions and prices of Sony's 
computer products. In each experiment, he sub- 
jects were requested to complete the conversation 
within 10 minutes. During the experiments, the 
number of occurrences of each facial display was 
counted. The conversation content was also evalu- 
ated based on how many topics a subject covered 
intentionally. The degree of task achievement re- 
flects how it is preferable to obtain a greater num- 
ber of visit more topics, and take the least amount 
of time possible. According to the frequencies 
of appeared facial displays and the conversational 
scores, the conversations that occurred during the 
experiments can be classified into two types. The 
first is "smooth conversation" in which the score is 
relatively high and the displays "Moderately con- 
fident," "Beginning of a story," and "Indication 
of attendance" appear most often. The second is 
"dull conversation," characterized by a lower score 
and in which the displays "Neutral" and "Not con- 
fident" appear more frequently. 
The results are summarized as follows. The 
details of the experiments were presented in an- 
other paper \[Takeuchi and Nagao, 1993\]. 
1. The first experiments of the two groups are 
compared. Conversation using facial displays 
is clearly more successful (classified as smooth 
conversation) than that using short phrases. We 
can therefore conclude that facial displays help 
conversation i  the case of initial contact. 
2. The overall results for both groups are com- 
pared. Considering that the only difference be- 
tween the two groups is the order in which the 
experiments were conducted, we can conclude 
that early interaction with facial displays con- 
tributes to success in the later interaction. 
3. The experiments using facial displays 1 e and 
those using short phrases N are compared. Con- 
trary to our expectations, the result indicates 
that facial displays have little influence on suc- 
cessful conversation. This means that the learn- 
ing effect, occurring over the duration of the ex- 
periments, is equal in effect to the facial dis- 
plays. However, we believe that the effect of 
the facial displays will overtake the learning ef- 
fect once the qualities of speech recognition and 
facial animation have been improved. 
The premature settings of the prototype sys- 
tem, and the strict restrictions imposed on the 
conversation inevitably detract from the poten- 
tial advantages available from systems using com- 
municative facial displays. We believe that fur- 
ther elaboration of the system will greatly im- 
prove the results. The subjects were relatively 
well-experienced in using computers. Experiments 
with computer novices should also be done. 
Concluding Remarks and Further 
Work 
Our experiments showed that facial displays are 
helpful, especially upon first contact with the sys- 
tem. It was also shown that early interaction 
with facial displays improves ubsequent interac- 
tion, even though the subsequent interaction does 
not use facial displays. These results prove quan- 
titatively that interfaces with facial displays help 
to break down the mental barrier that many users 
have toward computing systems. 
As a future research direction, we plan to in- 
tegrate more communication channels and modal- 
ities. Among these, the prosodic information pro- 
cessing in speech recognition and speech synthe- 
sis are of special interest, as well as the recogni- 
tion of users' gestures and facial displays. Also, 
further work needs to be done on the design 
and implementation of the coordination of mul- 
tiple communication modalities. We believe that 
such coordination is an emergent phenomenon 
from the tight interaction between the system and 
its ever-changing environments (including humans 
and other interactive systems) by means of situ- 
ated actions and (more deliberate) cooperative ac- 
tions. Precise control of multiple coordinated ac- 
tivities is not, therefore, directly implementable. 
Only constraints or relationships among percep- 
tion, conversational situations, and action will be 
implementable. 
To date, conversation with computing sys- 
tems has been over-regulated conversation. This 
has been made necessary by communication be- 
ing done through limited channels, making it nec- 
essary to avoid information collision in the nar- 
row channels. Multiple chamlels reduce the ne- 
cessity for conversational regulation, allowing new 
styles of conversation to appear. A new style of 
conversation has smaller granularity, is highly in- 
terruptible, and invokes more spontaneous utter- 
ances. Such conversation is (:loser to our daily con- 
versation with families and friends, and this will 
further increase familiarity with computers. 
Co-constructive conversation, that is less con- 
strained by domMns or tasks, is one of our fu- 
ture goals. We are extending our conversational 
model to deal with a new style of human-computer 
interaction called social interaction \[Nagao and 
Takeuchi, 1994\] which includes co-constructive 
conversation. This style of conversation features 
a group of individuMs where, say, those individ- 
uals talk about the food they ate together in a 
restraurant a month ago. There are no special 
roles (like the chairperson) for the participants to 
play. They all have the same role. The conversa- 
tion terminates only once all the participants are 
satisfied with the conclusion.

We are also interested in developing interac- 
tive characters and stories as an application for 
interactive ntertainment. We are now building a 
conversational, anthropomorphic computer char- 
acter that we hope will entertain us with some 
pleasant stories.
