ABSTRACT sequence of three le t ters ,  called a tr i l i teral  root.  
A proposed  "Matrix" method for  the representat ion  
of the inflectional paradigms of Arabic words is 
p resented .  This representat ion  resu l ts  in a 
classif ication of Arabic words into a tree s t ruc ture  
(F ig ( l ) )  whose leaves represent  un ique 
conjugational or derivat ional  parad igms,  each 
represented  in the proposed  "Matrix" form. 
A study of about 2,500 stems from a high frequency 
Arabic wordList due to Landau <I> has revealed a
systematic set of co-occurrence patterns for the 
encLitic pronouns of Arabic verbs and for the 
possessive pronouns attached to Arabic nouns. Each 
co-occurrence pattern represents a 
subcategorization frame that reflects the underlying 
semantic relationship. 
The key feature that d is t ingu ishes  these semantic 
pat terns  has been observed  to be whether  the 
attached suf f ixes  relate to the animate or inanimate. 
In some cases for verbs ,  the number  of the subject  
is also a s igni f icant  feature .  These semantic 
features  also extend to non-at tached sub jects  and 
objects ( for  verbs )  and to possess ive  noun 
complements ( for  nouns) .  Therefore  the semantic 
c lasses presented  in this paper  also ass i s t  in 
syntactic/semantic analysis. 
The first application that Was developed, based 
upon the proposed representaion is a stem-based 
Arabic morphological ans/yser, from which a spell 
checker (on a PS/2 microcomputer) emerged as a 
by-product. Currently, the system is being used to 
interact with an Arabic syntactic parser and there 
are plans to use it in a machine assisted translation 
system. 
i .  INTRODUCTION 
Over the past  few years  there has been a marked 
increase in the use of computers  in the Arabic 
speak ing  countr ies .  Many appl icat ions programs in 
Arabic have been developed,  but  the field of 
computat ions/  l inguist ics is relat ively new in Arabic 
and presents  a un ique chal lenge, due to the h ighly  
inf lected nature  of the Arabic language.  
In the present  work,  we have attempted to 
represent  the morphological ru les  govern ing  the 
inf lections of Arabic words in a compact form which 
can simplify the process ing  of Arabic words by  
computers  and which is independent  of the a 
part icu lar  appl icat ion. There have been other  
attempts to show the conjugat ions of Arabic verbs  
<2> but  the t reatment  does not delve into suf f ic ient  
depth  and not all encl it ics,  which are an essent ia l  
par t  of Arabic verbs ,  are cons idered.  Moreover,  
the t reatment  in <2> does not extend to nouns .  
By s tudy ing  some 2,500 stems out of a h igh 
f requency  Arabic wordl ist  due to Landau <1>, 
certa in systemat ic  o -occur rence  pat terns  govern ing  
verb  enclit ics and noun possess ive  pronouns  have 
been observed .  These pat terns  are what we call 
"Matrices" in this paper ;  each un ique "Matrix" 
ref lects a d i f ferent  semantic behav iour .  
To summarize Arabic morphology in a nutshe l l ,  
about  80 ~, of Arabic words can be der ived from a 
For example, i f  we cons ider  the root ~ ,~ 
(K T B),  we can form words such  as .l  -, .r _..?~ 
(?aKTuB - I wr ite)  and , ~  (KiTa:B - book) ,  by 
sub ject ing the root to var ious "forms" or "moulds" 
and by  undergo ing  certa in morpho-phonemic (and 
poss ib ly  also morpho-graphemic)  hanges .  For a full 
d iscuss ion of tradit ional  Arabic morphology see <9> 
and <10>. In this paper ,  we shall define such an 
inflected form to be a "STEM". 
Thus a stem may contain infixes and certain 
prefixes which are part of the "mould" but may not 
contain any suffixes. Suffixes for verbs are subject 
and object pronouns, while for nouns they are 
possessive pronouns. 
One further definition which is used in the 
proposed representaion is the "Core"; this is simply 
the inflected form with all prefixes and suffixes 
stripped off. The core may or may not be a valid 
word. 
In comparison with other  work in the area of 
tradit ional Arabic morphology (<3>,<4>), where the 
concern is with the rules which cause the inf lected 
form to be der ived from the ROOT, we have studied 
the rules governing the derivation of all possible 
inflected forms from the STEM, as defined above. 
2. THE MATRIX  REPRESENTATION 
Sample "MATRIX PARADIGMS" are shown in 
Fig(2) for verbs and Fig(3) for nouns. Table(1) 
gives the keys in English to the columns on the 
Matrix Paradigms. The inflected form for a given 
Person/Number~Gender/Mode combination for verbs 
(obtained from the relevant "row" of the Matrix 
Paradigm) is constructed by concatenating the 
prefix, core and both subject and object pronoun 
column entries. The inflected forms for nouns are 
sinfilarly const ructed  for a part icu lar  
Number /Gender /Case  combination. 
The various "cells" of the object pronoun columns 
indicate whether a particular entry is valid 
(indicated by "U', an Arabic numeral one). Invalid 
entries are indicated by a "'", an Arabic zero. It 
is due to this matrix of ones and zeros that the 
representation was named the "Matrix Paradigm". 
3. TAXONOMY OF ARABIC WORDS 
F ig ( l )  shows a tree diagram represent ing  the 
taxonomical classif ication of Arabic verbs  and 
nouns .  There  are d i f ferent  "levels" in the tree 
cor respond to d i f ferent  types of var iat ions of the 
inf lected form from one class to another .  The f i rst  
type of var iat ion coincides more or less with the 
tradit ional classif ication and is respresented  at 
levels 2 and 3 for verbs  and at level 2 for  nouns .  
Each Matrix Paradigm also reflects two further 
types of variation, which can be considered 
separately from one another. The first is the 
variation in the core with the different rows; this 
dimension cor responds ,  for example, to the 
tradit ional s tudy  of verb  conjugat ions (see <2>). 
- I - 
416 
The other type of variation is that in the 
distribution of the Matrix of ones and zeros, which 
is essentially a variation in the co-occurrence of 
object pronouns (for transitive verbs) and 
possessive pronouns (for nouns). This variation is 
reflected at level 4 of the taxonomy. In the 
following sections 3.1 and 3.2, we will discuss the 
study of these co-occurrence patterns in more detail 
for verbs  and nouns  separate ly .  
3.1 CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS FOR VERBS 
On examination of the Landau <I> high frequency 
wordlist, the following features eemed to 
distinguish classes of verbs apart: 
1- Whether the subject  is human or non-human (for 
both t rans i t ive  and int rans i t ive  verbs ) .  
2- Whether the object is human or non-human (for 
t rans i t ive  verbs  only) .  
3- The number  of the subject  ( for  in t rans i t ive  
"verbs only) .  
in Arabic,  there is a set of object p ronouns  which 
re fers  to a non-human object: (t . ,~,~,a) and this 
will be denoted by -H. This is a subset  of the 
complete set of p ronouns  +H, which denotes human 
and non-human.  Below, we will d iscuss  the features  
for t rans i t ive and h i t rans i t ive  verbs  separate ly :  
(a) Trans i t ive  Verbs :  
As shown in the table below, there can only be 4 
combinations of the features  +H and -H. Each of the 
feature sets  in the table has been des ignated a
class cede. Only verbs  with features  cor respond ing  
to the feature sets  B,C and D have been found in 
the Landau <I> short l i s t  examined. 
Feature Set code  ~ 
B +H +H 
C +H -H 
D *H -H 
? -H -H 
(b) Intz-ansitive Verbs :
It was found out that the subject  number  is an 
additional d i s t ingu ish ing  feature for t rans i t ive 
verbs .  Moreover, the subject  number  is sigmificant 
only in the case of human subjects. For non-human 
subjects, this feature is not significant. 
Based upon the above observat ions ,  we will define 
the d i s t ingu ish ing  features  for in t rans i t ive  verbs  to 
be +H(s ) ,+H(dp)  and -H, where s denotes s ingu lar  
and dp denotes dua l /p lura l .  +H(s) and +H(dp) 
denote the sets  of s ingu lar  and dua l /p lura l  
sub jects ,  respect ive ly .  By definit ion 
+t{(s) U +H(dp) -H, where U denotes the union 
of the two feature sets .  The table below shows the 
possible combinations of these features ;  only 
features  des ignated by  A,E and F were found for 
Landau's  <1> short t i s t .  
Feature Set Code S_uu:bjegt Feature___& 
A +H(s) U +H(dp) 
E -H 
F +H(dp) 
? +H(s) 
3.2 CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS FOR NOUNS 
The same set of object p ronouns  for verbs  denotes 
the possess ive  pronouns  for nouns ,  with the 
exception of a sl ight di f ference in form of the f i rst  
person  s ingular .  The -H set  is exact ly the same. 
Three dist inct c lasses of Matrix pat terns  (see 
level 3 of F ig ( l ) )  have been observed  for nouns:  
~ 2 - 
(A) No possess ive  pronouns  can be attached.  
(B) All possess ive  pronouns  can be attached.  
(C) Only possess ive  pronouns  related to the 
inanimate (set  -H) can be at tached.  
An addit ional s tudy  was made to determine what 
Number /Gender  (NG) combinations are valid for  a 
part icu lar  noun stem. These have been found to be 
an important  feature  of Arabic nouns ,  as not all NG 
combinations are valid for a stem? Each stem needs 
to be examined separate ly  and this information is 
put  into the lexicon of stem. The NG combinations 
are represented  at level 3 of the taxonomy, for 
nouns (see F ig ( l ) ) .  
A l though there is no systemat ic ,  theoretical method 
for deternf ining what all the di f ferent NG 
combinations are for comprehensive coverage of 
nouns, yet by examining more and more nouns from 
Landau's <I> wordlist, some form of convergence 
occurred. For the 2,500 stem shortlist, there were 
only 17 NG combinations. 
This curious feature of Arabic nouns can be mainly 
attributed to the presence of words of foreign 
origin and to the pragmatics of the noun in 
question. 
4. APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED 
As a first appl icat ion, an Arabic s tem-based 
morphological ana lyser  has been developed on an 
IBM PS/2 microcomputer.  Morphological features  of 
the word analysed are computed. 
As a by -product  of the ana lyser ,  an Arabic spel l ing 
verifier has been developed, by including 
unification of the morphological nd co-occurrence 
features of the morphemes. 
The system is cur rent ly  being developed for. use in 
the interact ion with an Arabic syntact ic  parser .
