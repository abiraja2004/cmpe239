PROGRAM GOALS 
The major objective of this program is to develop and demon- 
strate robust, high performance continuous peech recogni- 
tion (CSR) techniques focussed on application i  Spoken Lan- 
guage Systems (SLS) which will enhance the effectiveness of
military and civilian computer-based systems. A key com- 
plementary objective is to define and develop applications 
of robust speech recognition and understanding systems, and 
to help catalyze the transition of spoken language technology 
into military and civilian systems, with particular focus on 
application of robust CSR to mobile military command and 
control. The research effort focusses on developing advanced 
acoustic modelling, rapid search, and recognition-time adap- 
tation techniques for robust large-vocabulary CSR, and on 
applying these techniques to the new ARPA large-vocabulary 
CSR corpora and to military application tasks. 
BACKGROUND 
The Lincoln program began with s focus on improving 
speaker stress robustness for the fighter aircraft environ- 
ment. A robust HMM isolated-word recognizer (IWR) was 
developed with very high performance under stress condi- 
tions. The robust HMM techniques were then developed 
and extended to large-vocabulary CSR with state-of-the-art 
performance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker- 
independent (SI) tasks on the ARPA resource management 
(RM) database. 
More recently, the HMM CSR has been extended to tasks 
with much larger vocabularies (5,000 - 64,000 words) and 
higher perplexities (50 - 250) with focus on the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ) corpus. Improved acoustic modelling tech- 
niques for the tied-mixture CSR have been developed and 
applied, including multiple observation streams, semiphone 
models, sex- dependent acoustic models, cross-word triphone 
models, and improved duration modelling. For the large- 
vocabulary tasks, the Lincoln HMM CSR has been con- 
verted to use a stack decoder search algorithm with inte- 
grated acoustic fast match and detailed match algorithms.

RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Developed and improved the Lincoln large-vocabulary tied- 
mixture HMM CSR, including stack decoder search, acoustic 
fast-match, and cross-word and sex-dependent acoustic mod- 
els, and applied this CSR in the November 1993 evaluation 
tests; the new system showed a 42 percent improvement in 
error rate compared to the November 1992 evaluation test 
system. 
Developed and successfully tested recognition-time adap- 
tation techniques for large-vocabulary CSR in the November 
1993 evaluation tests. 
Developed tests on data-driven allophonic tree clustering 
smoothing techniques for best use of available training data. 
Developed Bayesian smoothing techniques for triphones 
and obtained promising initial results on CSR corpora. 
Continued contributions to ARPA CSR corpus develop- 
ment and evaluation, including contribution of stochastic lan- 
guage models to all sites for the 1993 evaluation tests; pro- 
vided the ARPA CSR community with text processing soft- 
ware tools for large-vocabulary corpus development. 
Organized and chaired the ARPA Spoken Language Tech- 
nology and Applications Day (SLTA 93), which has produced 
very promising results in catalyzing technology transition of 
spoken language technology into military and civilian appli- 
cations. 
PLANS 
Continue to develop large-vocabulary stack decoder-based 
HMM CSR, with particular focus on improvement of acoustic 
fast-match techniques, 
Develop advanced acoustic modelling techniques including 
data-driven decision-tree-based triphone smoothing. 
Develop run-time adaptation techniques for both acoustic 
HMM parameters and for stochastic language model param- 
eters; include adaptation to speaker, channel, environment,, 
and task. 
Continue to define and develop spoken language technol- 
ogy applications, with particular focus on recognition and 
understanding ofspoken messages in a command and control 
environment; also continue follow-up on other application op- 
portunities produced by SLTA 93. 
Chair the 1994 ARPA Human Language Technology Work- 
shop.
