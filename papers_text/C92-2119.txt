ABSTRACT 
Present limits of speech recognition and 
understandi?,g in the context of free 
spoken language (alttumgh with a limited 
vocabulary) have perverse ffects on the 
f low of the dialogue with a system. 
Typically a non robtt~'t dialogue manager 
will fail to face with these limits and 
conversations will often be a failure. This 
paper presents ome possibilities of a 
structural approach for  handling 
communication failures in task-oriented 
oral dialogues. Several types of 
communication failures are presented and 
explained. They must be dealt with by the 
dialogue manager i f  we strike to have a 
robt~t system. The exposed strategies for 
handling these failures are based on a 
structural approach of the conversation 
and are implemented in the SUNDIAL 
,wstem. We first recall some aspects of 
the model and then describe the strategies 
fo r  p revent ing  and repair ing 
communicat ion Jai lure in oral 
conversations with a system. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Despite the complexity of human-machine 
d ia logue,  the present  l imits of  speech 
recognition and understanding techniques add 
further complexity. The troublesome aspect of 
these limits is clearly that when a dialogue man- 
ager fails to face properly misunderstandings, 
and failures in general, the conversation is 
tedious and often of no use. Thus one main 
aspect of a robust oral dialogue system is to be 
able to cope with misunderstandings of any 
type and to respect a minimum of ergonomy in 
use. 
This paper exposes ome techniques developed 
in the SUNDIAL  1 sys tem (Speech 
F" SUNDIAL is partially funded hy the Commission for the 
European Communities ESPRIT programme, as project 
UNDerstanding and DIALogue), a mr, hi-user 
oral dialogue system over the telephone for da- 
tabase access. In this system the main objective 
is that the dialogue with the user must be effi- 
cient and robust such that computational pro- 
blems arc not apparent o the user, i.e., she 
nlust have the feeling to talk with an intelligent 
and llorulal parmer. 
The exposed techn iques  are obv ious ly  
dependent of the conversation model we used. 
Wc recall so far the model in section 2 and 3, 
but the reader is referred to IBilange 91a, 91b\] 
for further details. The rest of  the paper 
exposes several strategies to tackle with 
different ypes of communication failure. 
First, let us introduce the problematic in a more 
concrete  way and the typo logy  of  
comnmnication failures. 
The dialogue manager  receives as input a 
semantic representation of what the speech 
understanding layer has recognized from the 
user's utterance. One funct ional i ty is to 
interpret he current user's goal(s) in the context 
of the conversation and to appropriately react so 
ttmt the rusk progresses on the right track. 
ltowever, inputs may be corrupted in several 
ways: 
? there may be confusions for some words, 
? only a part of the utterance is understood, 
? what is understood is not what the user 
said, 
? nothing is understood. 
So whenever the dialogue manager receives an 
input, it is aware of these problems. It must 
then check with the user whether they share the 
same information. In other words, the system

has to be careful of providing enough feedback 
of its understanding in order to prevent failures. 
As we said earlier, this must be done in such a 
way that the dialogue remains efficient and 
natural. 
The techniques used for providing feedback 
and tackling with communication failure are 
entirely based on a structural model of the 
conversation in which we formalized several 
dialogue strategies. Before describing our 
solutions, we first give a brief overview of the 
underlying theory. 
2 THE D IALOGUE MODEL 
The model  is structural and funct ional  
\[Moeschler 89, Bilange 91a, Bilange 91b\]. The 
conversation is structured into four levels: 
transactions, exchanges, interventions, and 
dialogue acts. Each of these levels has 
functional relationships with the dominating 
and adjacent one. Fig. 1 presents the BNF 
syntax of  the model. 
A Dialogue is made of the following components: 
Transactions, Exchanges, Interventions, and 
Dialogue Acts (Da). The syntax of the model is as 
follows: 
D -~, {T} + 
T ~ (E}+ 
E-~. {I}+{E}*{I} *I{EI + 
1 --~ {Da} + 
" Fig. I: the BNF lorm of the mode.\[ 
? T ransact ions :  are the outmost level. 
Analyses of corpora revealed that task-oriented 
dialogues are a collection of phases \[Amalberti 
et al 84, Ponamal6 et al 90\], so-called 
transactions. In our domain, we can identify 
four main transactions: dialogue opening, pro- 
blem formulation, problem resolution, and 
dialogue closing. The second and the third ones 
form a sequence that can be iterated or/and that 
can recursively occnr during a conversation. 
One can think of transactions as discourse seg- 
ments \[Grosz and Sidner 861 that denote plan 
transitions' points at the task managentent level. 
During a transaction, the dialogue participants 
try to achieve a generic goal (open the dialogue, 
fornmlate the problem...) .  It has been also 
proved that participant roles depend on the type 
of the transaction and therefore participants' 
dialogue stlategies vary according to the current 
transaction \[Bilange 91 b l. 
? Exchanges:  are made up of interventions 
or of exchanges ( ub-exchanges). An exchange 
carries a specific goal that may contribute to the 
1 similar to moves inthe litteramre. 
transaction (the one it belongs to) or a goal 
dedicated to a communication clarification. An 
exchange has also three possible statuses: open, 
close or postponed. Once an exchange is 
closed, it is impossible to reenter it (e.g., if one 
wishes to discuss again about the same goal 
then a new exchange is opened). A postponed 
exchange is temporarily closed and may be re- 
opened later. 
? Intervent ions:  are the basic components 
of exchanges, and they are made up of dialogue 
acts. Three canonical illocutionary functions are 
attached to interventions: initiative, reaction and 
evaluation. Bas ica l ly ,  in i t iat ives 2 open 
exchanges: they introduce the goal of  the ex- 
change. Reactions react to initiatives (they may 
or may not be present) and evaluations evaluate 
the exchange (e.g., the status of the goal 
achievement: positive, negative, satisfying...). 
Things can be a bit more complex since 
initiatives, reactions and evaluations may not be 
a mere collection of dialogue acts but rather a 
collaborative process. This is why exchanges 
may also have these il locutionary functions 
attached to them. 
In oral human-machine interactions, it is crucial 
that evaluations can be performed by both user 
and system. Evaluating an exchange means 
verifying its completion, i.e., whether the 
underlying intention (goal) is reached or not. 
Therefore evaluations are of prime importance 
since the main side effect is that whenever the 
two diatoguees agree implicitly (a s imple 
evaluat ion)  or expl ic it ly (an evaluat ive 
exchange) then the evaluated exchange can be 
closed (and thus all information exchanged in it 
can be certified as shared by both dialoguees). 
? Dialogue acts are the basic components 
of  in te rvent ions .  D ia logue  acts  (as 
interventions) are monological units: they are 
performed by one participant as the result of an 
autonomous process, hi one intervention (say 
move) one cart perform more than one dialogue 
acts. At least one expresses the il locutionary 
function of the intervention, it is called the main 
act. D ia logue  acts are act ions  with 
preconditions and effects. We describe them in 
tile next section. 
From this hierarchical description, one can 
build a structure that dynamically represents he 
current state of the conversation. It is called the 
dialogue structure. This object is continuously 
updated as the dialogue goes on. The dialogue 
structnre may be thought as a tree where leaves 
2 a shortcut m say "interventions that have an initiative 
illocutionary function".

3 DIALOGUE ACTS AS RULES 
Dialogue acts come from the well-known 
theory of  speech acts. We agree with Bunt, 
however, that a dialogue act must be defined 
with respect o the modifications on the context 
\[Bunt 89\]. An act is then tittered when the 
context fits the conditions associated to it. In 
turn, the production of  an act modif ies the 
context. Therefore, a dialogue act is a function 
which transforms a context into a new one. For 
Bunt, the context is the description of both 
dialogue participants'  mental  states: their 
knowledge, suspicions and beliefs. 
However, some contextual aspects are difficult 
to encapsulate in a pure attitude model  
representation, especially those coming from 
structural indicators, denoted in the dialogue 
structure. Therefore, our notion of the context 
is Bunt's plus the dialogue structure \[Bilange 
91a\]. The advantage of  this approach is that 
some dialogue acts can be triggered if and only 
if certain patterns are present in the dialogue 
structure. This naturally captures the fact that 
performing dialogue acts must respect structural 
constraints and dialogue norms. 
So, dialogue acts are triggered when certain 
conditions are met. These conditions are of two 
kinds: structural and/or non-structural.  A
structural precondition enforces tire presertce 
(or absence) of a certain pattern in the dialogue 
structure for the act, if triggered. A non- 
structural precondition is tied to the mental 
states of  dialogue participants: task goals to 
achieve, mutual believes... 
Figure 2 presents an example of a system 
dia logue act which has only structural  
preconditons and effects. 
S denotes the dialogue structure. E denotes an 
exchange, made up here of one initiative (i(s)), 
one reaction (r(s)) and one evaluative xchange 
Ev E t . This evaluative xchange is in turn made 
up of one initiative and one reaction that is 
composed of one dialogue act: contest .  ("s" and 
"u" denote the system and the user resp.). 
From there, the system dialogue act req-for- 
spelling is triggered when an evaluation has 
been uttered by the system and that evaluation 
is contested by the user (the system's  
ewduation opens an evaluative xchange (EE"), 
thus it is an initiative and the user's contest is 
the reaction to that initiative). It is of course 
possible to define other dialogue acts based on 
the same idea: another act may be triggered 
when there are two, or three embedded 
evaluative xchanges instead of only one. It 
should be noticed that for req-for-spelling it is 
not necessary  to have non structura l  
precondit ions and effects. Typical ly,  only 
structural evidences me sufficient o trigger this 
act. This is what characterizes dialogue control 
acts. 
4 HANI )L ING COMMUNICAT ION 
FA ILURES 
4.2 Fa i lure  prevent ion  with feedback  
As said earlier, evahmtion purpose is mainly to 
close an exchange in providing a feedback on 
the outcome of the exchange intention. 
Ewduations are optional in essence, however a 
safe strategy for the system consists in using 
this opportunity to make clear what it 
understood. 
One can perfom~ an evaluation in several ways: 
e i ther  ira exp l i c i t l y  check ing  one 's  
unders tand ing  with a request  for an 
acknowledgment or implicitly with a mere 
echo. The first solution blocks the conversation 
on ,a chtrification whereas the second allows 
both dialogue participants to continue the 
conversat ion in moving to another topic. 
Obviously, the first behaviour is less risky for 
the system since the user may contest the 
evaluation anyway. However,  the second 
behaviour is more natural and fluid. Therefore, 
we endowed the system with the capacity of 
using both behaviours with a preference for the 
second. Basically, in the oral context, the 
system makes its choices on the basis of  
AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~\[' 1992 8 0 1 PROC. OV COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
acoustic .scores 3.Three different behaviours are 
defined, based on the distribution of scores 
among three categories: high, average, and 
low. 
? Low scores: only the evaluation is 
performed; 
? Average  scores: the evaluat ion is 
performed and the opening of  a new 
exchange is allowed. An example is given 
with S:t (see the dialogue below), where the 
evaluation concerns the destination and date 
(parameters obtained in the first exchange of 
the dialogue) and a new exchange is opened 
(the one conceming the solution). 
? High scores: similar to the average score 
case. However, the system can generate two 
acts that can be merged in the same sentence 
which can,  in some c i rcumstances ,  
strengthen the naturalness of the system's 
output. If the score were high in our 
dialogue, $2 would have been: "there is a 
flight to Rome which takes off at 10.30 on 
Tuesday, is that ok?" 
S1 Flight reservation system. Form ulate your requesl. 
UI I'd like to go to Bonn on next Tuesday morning. 
$2 Rome next Tuesday, there is a flight which lakes 
offat 10.30, is that ok? 
U2 No I want to go to BONN 
$3 ok, Bonn. There is a flight... 
Whatever the scores are the system, while 
per forming an evaluat ion,  systemat ical ly  
predicts a possible user contest.  These 
predictions are precise since the system knows 
exactly where and on what information contests 
can occur. U2, for example, has been predicted 
and the prediction says that if the user contests 
the arrival city it is out of question to recognize 
the same value (i.e., Rome). Moreover, the 
system knows that if the user accepts an 
evaluation then the evaluated information is 
certified as shared (implicitly). This is the case 
of the departure date in our example (one can 
notice that the acceptance is not explicit, this is 
discussed in the next section). This is why in 
$3, the system has to conf irm only the 
departure city. 
Scores are not the only information used by the 
system to plan its behaviour. The system can 
evaluate the degree of risk when merging 
evaluations with other acts. in our example, $2 
is cons idered as r isky s ince there are 
simultaneously a twofold evaluation (city and 
date), a topic shift and a transaction shift (from 
problem formulation to problem resolution). 
3 More precisely on a combination f acoustic scores and 
the perplexity. 
The transaction shift is risky since the system 
closes a transaction where some parameters are 
not yet confirmed and the evaluation is also 
risky since correctly recognizing a contest 
means recognizing on what the contest is about 
between two possibilities. However, $3 is less 
risky. 
The evaluation principles enumerated above 
with the notion of risk in one utterance provide 
a good help for preventing failures in a very 
ergonomic fashion. This technique is well 
perceived by the majority of tested users. 
4.2 S t ruc tura l  detect ion  of  some 
fa i lu res  
In this section we illustrate how the structure of 
the conversation helps the system to detect 
failure situations. 
Figure 3 (next page) shows two dialogues that 
differ only because of a failure in the second 
one. The structures of  these dialogues are 
presented on the right hand side. 
The system has tentatively opened a new 
exchange about the departure date, but before 
doing so, it has uttered an evaluation to close 
the previous exchange by echoing what it 
believes the departure and arrival cities are. At 
this stage, two possible continuations are: 
? the user answers the question about the 
date; this means that she implicitly agrees 
one the system's evaluation. Et can then be 
closed; 
? the user utters a disagreement about the 
evaluation. 
These possible cont inuat ions are shown in 
figure 3. In the case of  the user's contest 
(continuation 1I), the system's evaluat ion 
becomes the initiative of an evaluative xchange 
(E E') and E2 is postponed. The shape of  the 
dialogue structure is typical in such a case of 
failure. This leads to the idea that one could 
examine the dia logue structure to detect 
communicat ion  fa i lures and to tr igger 
appropriate repair strategies. 
Precisely, through dialogue act definitions, the 
system detects failures in triggering dialogue 
control acts. From now, implementing a repair 
strategy is easily done in adding new acts. 
Actually, in the Sundial system a situation like 
the one in continuation II is treated as follow: 
the system triggers a req-for-spell ing (see the 
preconditions in figure 2). This strong dialogue 
control act permits the system to send very 
accurate predictions, telling the speech un-

observed that oral spell ing is robust iff the 
speech understanding layer tries to recognize

in the Sundia l  speech unders tand ing  
component.  So this strategy offers a very 
robust approach that can be easily generalized

Figure 4 shows one actual dialogue obtained 
with Sundial with this technique. In this 
dialogue, one can observe that the system has 
temporari ly focused on the communicat ion 
problem and once it is solved, it reintroduces 
the departure date topic. 
We have examined here some possibilities of 
preventing and repairing failures in intensively 
taking into account the dialogue structure, 
specially at lhc level of dialogue act definitions. 
Dialogue control acts arc of prime importance 
for obtaining accurate predictions that indeed 
help the speech tmderstanding layer. 
5 ACCEPTABIL ITY  OF  THE 
SEMANTIC  INPUT 
We examine now some cases in which a 
pragmatically doubtful input can be rejected by 
the diaktgue manager with the help of structural 
evidences. Let us first examine the following 
scellario: 
During its turn, the system has evaluated 
an exchange E 1 and opened a new one 
E2. It is now the turn of the user (this 
situation is similar to continuation 1 in 
./igure 3 bejore U2). 
A system initiative may be of two types: 
(i) an initiative such that the user can 
implicitly react, 
(ii) an initiative such that the user can only 
perform an explicit reaction. 
Figure 5 provides an example where the 
system's initiative in E2 is of type (ii). 
The last user's input seems quite surprising.

Fie.6: a skeleton for user's initi~aive definitions 
The user is actually supposed to react to the 
system's initiative in E2 or to the evaluation of 
El, or both. U2 is a complete topic shift (not 
related to the problem formulation of  the one- 
way -the current ransaction-). From the system 
point of view, the most natural interpretation is 
that a recognit ion failure most probably 
occurred. This structural aspect (which captures 
normative evidences of the conversation) 
allows the inhibition of some user's initiatives 
interpretation when there exists, somewhere in
the dia logue structure, a non-answered 
system's initiative of type (ii). This leads to the 
general definition of user's initiatives presented 
in figure 6. 
Conversely, if the system initiative is of type 
(i), like in figure 7, the user's input can be 
accepted. 
So, once an input has been rejected, the system 
must enter a repair process. In the case given in 
figure 5, the real user's utterance could be an 
answer on the departure date or a contest o the 
evaluation as well. The strategy is then to ask 
the user to repeat without changing the situation 
(except hat the system remembers that there 
was a failure. If the failure continues then other 
strong control can be perform such as connect 
to a human operator).

We have studied and exploited these capacities 
for at least a small set of possibilities. This 
approach has to be enriched to cover more 
s i tuat ions .  C lear ly ,  this approach  is 
complementary to the ones based on pure atti- 
tude models of both dialogue participants and 
this is where our system should be enlarged 
too. 
The optimistic onclusion is to say that with the 
SUNDIAL system, dialogues never totally fail: 
failure/repair sequences often occur but at least 
the conversation always ends to the result 
envisaged by the user. This  is what we 
observed after having tested a range of 20 naive 
users who were general ly (around 90%) 
satisfied of the dialogues thay had with the 
system. 
6 CONCLUSION 
The structural model of the conversation t, sed 
in the Sundial system offers great capacities to 
deal with speech pitfalls. 
We have presented here some techniques to 
both prevent and repair misunderstandings. The 
benefit of the structure of the communication is 
to enrich, in a practicable way, the notion of 
context usually based on mental attitudes. This 
benefit  a l lows to enr ich d ia logue act
