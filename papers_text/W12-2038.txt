Abstract
To support vocabulary acquisition and read-
ing comprehension in a second language, we
have developed a system to display sense-
appropriate examples to learners for difficult
words. We describe the construction of the
system, incorporating word sense disambigua-
tion, and an experiment we conducted testing
it on a group of 60 learners of English as a
second language (ESL). We show that sense-
specific information in an intelligent reading
system helps learners in their vocabulary ac-
quisition, even if the sense information con-
tains some noise from automatic processing.
We also show that it helps learners, to some
extent, with their reading comprehension.
1 Introduction and Motivation
Reading texts in a second language presents the
language learner with a number of comprehension
problems, including the problem of interpreting
words that are unknown or are used in unfamiliar
ways. These problems are exacerbated by the preva-
lence of lexical ambiguity. Landes et al (1998) re-
port that more than half the content words in English
texts are lexically ambiguous, with the most frequent
words having a large number of meanings. The
word face, for example, is listed in WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) with twelve different nominal senses;
although not all are equally prevalent, there is still
much potential for confusion.
To address this, we have designed an online read-
ing assistant to provide sense-specific lexical in-
formation to readers. By sense-specific, we refer
to information applicable only for one given sense
(meaning) of a word. In this paper, we focus on
the system design and whether such a system can be
beneficial. Our experiment with learners illustrates
the effectiveness of such information for vocabulary
acquisition and reading comprehension.
The problem of lexical ambiguity in reading com-
prehension is a significant one. While dictionar-
ies can help improve comprehension and acquisition
(see, e.g., Prichard, 2008), lexical ambiguity may
lead to misunderstandings and unsuccessful vocabu-
lary acquisition (Luppescu and Day, 1993), as learn-
ers may become confused when trying to locate an
appropriate meaning for an unknown word among
numerous sense entries. Luppescu and Day showed
that readers who use a (printed) dictionary have im-
proved comprehension and acquisition, but to the
detriment of their reading speed.
For electronic dictionaries as well, lexical am-
biguity remains a problem (Koyama and Takeuchi,
2004; Laufer and Hill, 2000; Leffa, 1992; Prichard,
2008), as readers need specific information about a
word as it is used in context in order to effectively
comprehend the text and thus learn the word. Kulka-
rni et al (2008) demonstrated that providing readers
with sense-specific information led learners to sig-
nificantly better vocabulary acquisition than provid-
ing them with general word meaning information.
We have developed an online system to provide
vocabulary assistance to learners of English as a
Second Language (ESL), allowing them to click
on unfamiliar words and see lexical information?
target word definitions and examples?relevant to
that particular usage. We discuss previous online
316
systems in section 2. Importantly, the examples we
present are from the COBUILD dictionary (Sinclair,
2006), which is designed for language learners. To
present these for any text, our system must map au-
tomatic word sense disambiguation (WSD) system
output (using WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998)) to
COBUILD, as covered in section 3, where we also
describe general properties of the web system.
The main contribution of this work is to investi-
gate whether high-quality sense-specific lexical in-
formation presented in an intelligent reading system
helps learners in their vocabulary acquisition and
reading comprehension and to investigate the effect
of automatic errors on learning. We accordingly ask
the following research questions:
1. Does sense-specific lexical information facili-
tate vocabulary acquisition to a greater extent
than: a) no lexical information, and b) lexical
information on all senses of each chosen word?
2. Does sense-specific lexical information facili-
tate learners? reading comprehension?
The method and analysis for investigating these
questions with a group of 60 ESL learners is given in
section 4, and the results are discussed in section 5.
2 Background
While there are many studies in second language
acquisition (SLA) on providing vocabulary and
reading assistance (e.g., Prichard, 2008; Luppescu
and Day, 1993), we focus on outlining intelligent
computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) sys-
tems here (see also discussion in Dela Rosa and Es-
kenazi, 2011). Such systems hold the promise of al-
leviating some problems of acquiring words while
reading by providing information specific to each
word as it is used in context (Nerbonne and Smit,
1996; Kulkarni et al, 2008). The GLOSSER-RuG
system (Nerbonne and Smit, 1996) disambiguates
on the basis of part of speech (POS). This is helpful
in distinguishing verbal and nominal uses, for ex-
ample, but is, of course, ineffective when a word
has more than one sense in the same POS (e.g.,
face). More effective is the REAP Tutor (Heilman
et al, 2006), which uses word sense disambigua-
tion to provide lexicographic information and has
been shown to benefit learners by providing sense-
specific lexical information (Dela Rosa and Eske-
nazi, 2011; Kulkarni et al, 2008).
We build from this work by further demonstrat-
ing the utility of sense-specific information. What
distinguishes our work is how we build from the no-
tion that the lexical information provided needs to
be tuned to the capacities of ESL learners. For ex-
ample, definitions and illustrative examples should
make use of familiar vocabulary if they are to aid
language learners; example sentences directly taken
from corpora or from the web seem less appropriate
because the information in them might be less ac-
cessible (Groot, 2000; Kilgarriff et al, 2008; Segler
et al, 2002). On the other hand, examples con-
structed by lexicographers for learner dictionaries
typically control for syntactic and lexical complexity
(Segler et al, 2002). We thus make use of examples
from a dictionary targeting learners.
Specifically, we make use of the examples from
the Collins COBUILD Student?s Dictionary (Sin-
clair, 2006), as it is widely used by ESL learners.
The content in COBUILD is based on actual English
usage and derived from analysis of a large corpus of
written and spoken English, thereby providing au-
thentic examples (Sinclair, 2006). COBUILD also
focuses on collocations in choosing example sen-
tences, so that the example sentences present nat-
ural, reliable expressions, which can play an im-
portant role in learners? vocabulary acquisition and
reading comprehension. We discuss this resource
more in section 3.3.
3 The web system
To support vocabulary acquisition and reading com-
prehension for language learners, we have designed
a system for learners to upload texts and click on
words in order to obtain sense-appropriate examples
for difficult words while reading, as shown in fig-
ure 1. Although the experiment reported upon here
focused on 2 preselected texts, the system is able to
present lexical information for any content words.
Beyond the web interface, the system has three com-
ponents: 1) a system manager, 2) a natural language
processing (NLP) server, and 3) a lexical database.
317
Figure 1: A screenshot showing the effect of clicking on unveiling and receiving sense-specific information
3.1 System manager
The system manager controls the interaction among
each learner, the NLP server, and the lexical
database. When the manager receives a raw text as
an input from the learner, it first sends the input text
to the server and returns an analyzed text (i.e., tok-
enized, POS-tagged, and sense-tagged) back to the
learner, with content words made clickable. Then,
when the learner clicks on a word while reading, the
manager sends the word with its sense information
to the lexical database and brings the word with its
sense-specific lexical information back to the learner
from the lexical database.
Upon completion of the reading, the manager
sends the learner to a page of tests?i.e., a read-
ing test and a vocabulary test, as described in sec-
tion 4?and records the responses.
3.2 NLP preprocessing
To convert raw input into a linguistically-analyzed
text, the system relies on several basic NLP modules
for tokenizing, lemmatizing, POS tagging, and col-
location identification. Although for some internal
testing with different WSD systems we used other
third-party software (e.g., the Stanford POS tagger
(Toutanova et al, 2003)), our word sense disam-
biguator (see below) provides tokenization, lemma-
tization, and POS tagging, as well as collocation
identification. Since the words making up a colloca-
tion may be basic, learners can easily overlook them,
and so we intend to improve this module in the fu-
ture, to reduce underflagging of collocations.
3.3 Lexical database
The lexical database is used to provide a sense-
appropriate definition and example sentences of an
input word to a learner. To obtain the sense-
appropriate information, we must perform word
sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text. We
use SenseRelate::AllWords (SR:AW) (Pedersen and
Kolhatkar, 2009) to perform WSD of input texts, as
this system has broad coverage of content words.
Given that SR:AW does not outperform the most fre-
quent sense (MFS) baseline, we intend to explore
using the MFS in the future, as well as other WSD
systems, such as SenseLearner (Mihalcea and Cso-
mai, 2005). However, the quality of SR:AW (F-
measure of 54?61% on different corpora) is suffi-
cient to explore in our system and gives us a point
to work from. Indeed, as we will see in section 5.3,
318
while SR:AW makes errors, vocabulary learning is,
in some ways, perhaps not dramatically impeded.
Even with a WSD system, pointing to appropriate
examples is complicated by the fact that the database
of learner-appropriate examples is from one repos-
itory (COBUILD, see section 2), while automatic
WSD systems generally use senses from another
(WordNet). The lexical database, then, is indexed by
WordNet senses, each of which points to an appro-
priate corresponding COBUILD sense. While we
would prefer disambiguating COBUILD senses di-
rectly, we are not aware of any systems which do
this or any COBUILD sense-tagged data to train a
system on. If the benefits for vocabulary acquisition
gained by providing learner-friendly examples from
COBUILD merit it, future work could explore build-
ing a collection of COBUILD-tagged data to train
a WSD system?perhaps a semi-automatic process
using the automatic system we describe next.
To build a lexical database covering all words, we
built a word sense alignment (WSA) system; this
is also in line with a related research agenda in-
vestigating the correspondences between sense in-
ventories (Eom et al, 2012). Space limitations pre-
clude a more detailed discussion, but the WSA sys-
tem works by running SR:AW on COBUILD exam-
ples in order to induce a basic alignment structure
between WordNet and COBUILD. We then post-
process this structure, relying on a heuristic of favor-
ing flatter alignment structures?i.e., links spread
out more evenly between senses in each inventory.1
Iteratively replacing one link with another, to give
flatter structures, we weight each type of proposed
alignment and accept a new alignment if the weight
combined with the probability originally assigned
by the WSD system is the best improvement over
that of the original alignment structure. After all
these steps, the alignments give the lexical database
for linking WSD output to COBUILD senses.
We consider alignment structures wherein each
WordNet sense maps to exactly one COBUILD
sense, to match the task at hand, i.e., mapping each
disambiguated WordNet sense to a single set of
COBUILD examples. This assumption also makes
postprocessing feasible: instead of considering an

structure as a whole; flatter alignments is a convenient heuristic,
in lieu of having any other additional information.
exponential number of alignment structures, we con-
sider only a polynomial number.
Having collected alignment judgments from lin-
guistics students and faculty, we evaluated the sys-
tem against a small set of nine words, covering 63
WordNet senses (Eom et al, 2012). The WSA sys-
tem had a precision of 42.7% (recall=44.5%) when
evaluating against the most popular sense, but a
precision of 60.7% (recall=36.5%) when evaluating
against all senses that seem to be related. We focus
on precision since it is important to know whether
a learner is being pointed to a correct set of exam-
ples or not; whether there are other possibly relevant
examples to show is less important. In Eom et al
(2012), we discuss some difficulties of aligning be-
tween the two resources in the general case; while
some senses go unaligned between the resources,
this was not the case for the words used in this study.
For this study, since we use pre-determined in-
put texts, we also created gold-standard information,
where each word in the text is manually given a link
to the appropriate COBUILD information; note that
here there is no intermediate WordNet sense to ac-
count for. This lets us gauge: a) whether the gold-
standard information is helpful to learners, and b)
comparatively speaking, what the effects are of us-
ing the potentially noisy information provided by the
functioning system.
4 The study
We now turn to evaluating whether this set-up
of providing sense-specific lexical information can
lead learners to improve their vocabulary acquisition
and their reading comprehension.
4.1 Method
4.1.1 Participants
The participants were recruited from three univer-
sities and a private institute in Seoul, Korea, giv-
ing 60 participants (34 male, 26 female). They
ranged in age from 21 to 39 (avg.=23.8) and the
length of studying English ranged from 8 to 25 years
(avg.=11.32).
The 40 participants from the three universities
were taking English courses to prepare for English
proficiency testing. The 20 participants from the
private institute were mostly university graduates
319
taking teacher training courses designed for ele-
mentary English teachers. All participants were
intermediate-level learners, scoring between 15 and
21 on the reading section of the TOEFL iBT R?. We
targeted intermediate learners, so as to test the sys-
tem with learners generally able to understand texts,
yet still encounter many unknown words.
The 60 participants were randomly assigned to
one of four groups, with 15 participants in each
group. The first three received some treatment,
while the fourth was a control group:
1. Gold Senses (GS): reading with support of gold
standard sense-specific lexical information
2. System Senses (SS): reading with support of
system-derived sense-specific lexical informa-
tion
3. All Senses (AS): reading with support of lexi-
cal information of all senses of the chosen word
4. No Senses (NS): reading without any support
of lexical information
For example, when presented with the example
in (1), if chains is clicked, the GS learners see the
correct sense, as in (2a), along with associated ex-
ample sentences (not shown). The automatic system
happens to be incorrect, so the SS learners see a re-
lated, though incorrect, sense and examples, as in
(2b). The AS learners will see those two senses and
examples, as well as the three others for chain. And
the NS learners have no chance to click on a word.
(1) There?s a chance that there will be new items
if you shop at any of the retail chains that
use the ?fast fashion? model of business.
(2) a. Gold: A chain of shops, hotels, or other
businesses is a number of them owned
by the same person or company.
b. System: A chain of things is a group of
them existing or arranged in a line.
4.1.2 Materials
Reading texts After piloting various reading texts
and drawing on the ESL teaching experience of
two of the authors, two texts deemed appropriate
for learners at the (high-)intermediate level were
adopted: Fashion Victim (adapted from Focus on

Table 1: Target words used in the study
2011), 589 words) and Sleep Research (adapted
from The Official SAT Study Guide (The College
Board, 2009), 583 words).
The texts were modified to simplify their syntax,
to use more ambiguous words in order to allow for
a stronger test of the system, and to shorten them to
about 600 words. The texts were placed in the online
system, and all content words were made clickable.
Target words A total of 20 target words (9 from
Fashion Victim, 11 from Sleep Research) were se-
lected by piloting a number of possible words with
20 learners from a similar population and identify-
ing ones which were the most unfamiliar, which also
had multiple senses. They appear in table 1.
Reading comprehension tests For reading com-
prehension, two tests were developed, each with
4 multiple-choice and 6 true-false questions. The
questions focused on general content, and partici-
pants could not refer back to the text to answer the
questions. For the multiple-choice questions, more
than one answer could be selected, and each choice
was scored as 1 or 0 (e.g., for 5 choices, the maxi-
mum score for the question was 5); for the true-false
questions, answers were scored simply 1 or 0. The
maximum score for a test was 21.
Vocabulary tests There were one pretest and four
immediate posttests, one of which had the same for-
mat as the pretest. The pretest and all immediate
posttests had the same 30 words (20 target and 10
distractor words). Of 10 distractors, five were words
appearing in the text (obscure.a, correlation.n, in-
tervention.n, discipline.v, facilitate.v), and five were
target words but used with a sense that was different
from the one used in the reading passage (deliber-
ately.r, chain.n, outfit.n, mend.v, indicate.v). Each
test consisted of a word bank and sentences with
320
blanks (cf. Kim, 2008). For the pretest, the sentences
were taken from other sources, whereas the posttest
sentences came from the reading texts themselves.
Although we used four posttests in order to test
different kinds of vocabulary learning (giving more
or fewer hints at meaning), we focus on one posttest
in this paper, the one which matches the form of the
pretest. Each correct answer was scored as 1; incor-
rect as 0.
4.1.3 Procedure
The pretest was administered two weeks before
the actual experiment and posttests, so as to prevent
learners from focusing on those words. Participants
who knew more than 16 out of the 20 target words
were excluded from the experiment.
After reading one text, learners took a reading
comprehension test. Then, they did the same for the
second text. After these two rounds, they took the
series of vocabulary posttests.
4.1.4 Data analysis
We ran a variety of tests to analyze the data.2
First, we ran Levene?s test of homogeneity of vari-
ances, to test whether the variances of the error be-
tween groups were equal at the outset of the study.
This makes it clearer that the effects from the main
tests are due to the variables of interest and not from
inherent differences between groups (Larson-Hall,
2010).
Secondly, to test the first research question about
whether participants show better vocabulary acqui-
sition with sense-specific lexical information, we
used a repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM
ANOVA). Time (pre/post) was the within-subject
variable and Group (GS, SS, AS, NS) was the
between-subject. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons
were run in the case of significant results, to deter-
mine which groups differed from each other. We
also examined the pre-post gain only for the target
words which were clicked and for which we might
thus expect more improvement.
Thirdly, to test the second research question about
whether participants improved in reading compre-
hension, we used a one-way ANOVA, with reading
comprehension scores as a dependent variable and

tion, percentage out of all 20 answers in parentheses)
the four groups as an independent variable, to ex-
plore if there was any significant main effect of the
group on reading comprehension scores. Post-hoc
tests were then used, in order to determine specifi-
cally which groups differed from each other.
In order to gauge the effect of automatic system
errors?distinguishing the SS (System Senses) and
GS (Gold Senses) conditions?on vocabulary acqui-
sition, we also examined target words where the sys-
tem gave incorrect information.
5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Vocabulary acquisition
Since the first research question is to examine the
improvement between the pretest and the posttest,
the test of homogeneity of variance was carried
out to ensure that the pretest/posttest scores of the
participants across the four groups showed similar
variances. Levene?s test of homogeneity of vari-
ances suggested that the 4 groups could be con-
sidered to have similar variances on both the pre-
test (F (3, 55) = 0.49, p = 0.69) and the post-test
(F (3, 56) = 0.13, p = 0.94), meaning that this as-
sumption underlying the use of ANOVA was met.
Looking at the descriptive statistics in table 3,
none of the groups differed from each other by more
than a quarter of a point (or 1 percentage point) on
the pretest. Thus, the groups are also comparable
with respect to their levels of performance on the
pre-test.
Turning to the results of the treatments in ta-
ble 3, the four groups show larger differences on
their posttest. The GS and SS groups show the clear-
est gains, suggesting greater vocabulary acquisition
than the AS and NS groups, as expected. If we look
at percentage gain, GS gained 26% and SS 23%,

while AS gained only 13% and NS 2%.
In order to examine whether the above differ-
ences among groups were statistically significant, a
repeated-measures ANOVA was run on those pretest
and posttest scores, with Group as the between-
subject variable and Time as the within-subject vari-
able. The results of the RM ANOVA are presented
in table 2.
With respect to the within-subject variable, the ef-
fect of Time shows a statistically significant differ-
ence (F (1, 56) = 62.67, p < .001, partial eta2=
0.53). In other words, not considering Group, there
is evidence of improvement from pre to posttest.
Most crucially related to the first research ques-
tion about whether the groups would have different
amounts of vocabulary acquisition over time, we see
a significant Time*Group effect (F (3, 56) = 7.20,
p < .001, partial eta2= 0.28). The partial eta2 val-
ues for Time (0.53) and Time*Group (0.28) in ta-
ble 2 represent large effect sizes which thus provide
strong evidence for the differences.
Two sets of post-hoc comparisons were con-
ducted. The first comparisons, in table 4, show sig-
nificant mean differences between the pretest and
posttest for three groups (GS, SS, AS), whereas no
significant difference is observed in the NS group,
meaning that the three groups who received lexi-
cal information showed improvement whereas the
group who received no information did not.
Then, a second set of post-hoc tests were run to
compare the three groups which showed significant
pre-post gains (GS, SS, AS). In table 5, the Contrast
Estimate (Est.) looks at the differences in the mean
pre-post gains and shows that the GS group is sig-
nificantly different from the AS group, whereas the
difference between the mean gains of the SS and AS
groups is not quite significant. (The GS-SS contrast

pendent variable is the difference in mean pre-post gains

comparisons on the Time*Group interaction effect
found a significant difference between the GS and
AS groups in their vocabulary learning over time,
with the GS group showing greater pretest-posttest
improvement, whereas the SS?s group apparent ad-
vantage over the AS group with their mean gains fell
slightly short of statistical signficance.
Clicked words In addition to analyzing learners?
performance on the overall scores of their pretest
and posttest, we examine their performance over
their pretest and posttest only on words they clicked
while reading, as well as how much they clicked.
In the three treatments, we find: GS, 28.27 words
clicked on average (7.00 target words); SS, 21.80
(5.93); and AS, 20.87 (5.60). Although these dif-
ferences are not statistically significant, the appar-
ent trend may suggest that the GS group realized

Table 6: Descriptive statistics for vocabulary acquisition

they could get high-quality lexical information from
clicking words and so clicked more often.
Examining only clicked target words, the test of
homogeneity confirmed the error variance of all par-
ticipants were equivalent at the outset of the study
(p = 0.15). The percentages correct of the words
that were clicked in the pretest and posttest are in
table 6. The pre to post gain here conveys a gen-
eral trend: for the words participants clicked on, they
showed improvement, with larger gains than for all
words (compare the best gain of 26% in table 3).
As with all words, in the RM ANOVA the effect
of Time shows a statistically significant difference
(F (1, 42) = 96.20, p < 0.01). However, the ef-
fect of Time*Group shows no significant difference
in this case (F (2, 42) = 0.60, p = 0.55).
Despite non-significance, two potentially interest-
ing points emerge which can be followed up on in
the future: 1) descriptively speaking, the SS group
shows the largest gain between pretest and posttest
(56%); and 2) the AS group shows as much improve-
ment as the GS group (45%). This may come from
the fact that the number of senses listed for many
clicked words was small enough (e.g., 2?3) to find
an appropriate sense. Future work could investigate
a greater number of target words to verify and shed
more light on these trends.
Discussion In sum, our results suggest a positive
answer to the first research question about whether
sense-specific lexical information leads learners to
better vocabulary acquisition. The results from
several different analyses suggest that: 1) learn-
ers provided with lexical information during read-
ing have more vocabulary acquisition, with sense-
specific information having a greater increase; 2)
learning gains appear to be greater for the subset of
clicked target words than for all words (though fur-
ther research is needed to substantiate this); and 3)

5.2 Reading comprehension
The second research question explores whether
sense-specific lexical information facilitates reading
comprehension. The descriptive statistics for read-
ing comprehension mean scores of the four groups
are in table 7. The difference among the reading
comprehension mean scores of the four groups was
within about 4 points, corresponding to a 9% differ-
ence (SS, 88%; NS, 79%). The GS and SS groups
have the highest values, but only small differences.
In order to examine whether the above differ-
ences among groups were statistically significant,
a one-way ANOVA was run on reading compre-
hension scores. The test of homogeneity of vari-
ances confirmed the error variances were equivalent
(p = 0.42). The results of the one-way ANOVA are
in table 8.
As shown, the effect of Group shows a sta-
tistically significant difference, indicating that the
groups are different in their reading comprehension
(F (3, 56) = 4.01, p = 0.01). With this significant
difference in reading comprehension performance, it
is necessary to locate where the differences existed
among the groups. Tukey post0hoc tests compared
all four groups in pairs and revealed a significant
difference between the SS group and the NS group
(p = 0.007), with no significant differences between
the other pairs.3
To some extent, the results support the idea that
3GS vs. SS: p = 0.68; GS vs. AS: p = 0.87; GS vs. NS:
p = 0.12; SS vs. AS: p = 0.24; AS vs. NS: p = 0.46.

sense-specific lexical information facilitates learn-
ers? reading comprehension. Curiously, the GS
group, which received more accurate sense infor-
mation than the SS group, was not found to outper-
form the control group (p = 0.12)?despite descrip-
tively showing slightly higher reading comprehen-
sion scores. This issue warrants future investigation.
5.3 Quality of sense information
We have observed some differences between the
Gold Senses (GS) and System Senses (SS) con-
ditions, but we still want to explore to what ex-
tent the learners in SS group were impacted by
words which were incorrectly disambiguated. There
were nine words which the automatic system incor-
rectly assigned senses to (inappropriate target-sense
words),4 and eleven words which it correctly as-
signed. One can see the different performance for
these two types in table 9, for words that learners
clicked on.
There are two take-home points from this table.
First, when learners were correct in the pretest, they
generally did not un-learn that information, regard-
less of whether they were receiving correct sense in-
formation or not (88% vs. 83%). This is important,
as it seems to indicate that wrong sense information
is not leading learners astray. However, the second
point is that when learners were wrong in the pretest,
they were in general able to learn the sense with cor-
rect information (76%), but not as effectively when
given incorrect information (50%). This, unsurpris-
ingly, shows the value of correct sense information.

6 Summary and Outlook
We have developed a web system for displaying
sense-specific information to language learners and
tested it on a group of 60 ESL learners. We showed
that sense-specific information in an intelligent read-
ing system can help learners in their vocabulary ac-
quisition and, to some extent, may also help with
overall reading comprehension. We also showed
preliminary results suggesting that learners might
learn more of the words whose definitions they
check than words they simply encounter while read-
ing. We can also be optimistic that, while there is
still much room for improvement in presenting sense
information automatically, errors made by the sys-
tem do not seem to interfere with language learners?
previously-known meanings.
There are a number of avenues to pursue in the fu-
ture. One thing to note from the results was that the
group receiving help in the form of all senses (AS)
demonstrated relatively high performance in vo-
cabulary acquisition and reading comprehension, at
times similar to the groups receiving sense-specific
information (GS, SS). This may be related to the
small number of sense entries of the target words
(average = 2.95), and a further study should be done
on target words with more sense entries, in addition
to validating some of the preliminary results pre-
sented in this paper regarding clicked words. Sec-
ondly, the word sense disambiguation methods and
construction of the lexical database can be improved
to consistently provide more accurate sense infor-
mation. Finally, as mentioned earlier, there are pre-
processing improvements to be made, such as im-
proving the search for collocations.
