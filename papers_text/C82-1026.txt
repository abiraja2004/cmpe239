The DAISY/ALIBABA-system developed within the WAl-project 
represents both a specif ic solution to the automatic indexing 
problem and a general framework for problems in the f ie ld  of 
natural language processing, characterized by fuzziness and 
uncertainty? The WAI approach to the indexing problem has already 
been published \ [3 \ ] ,  \ [5\] .  This paper however presents the under- 
lying paradigm of recognizing abstract objects. The basic 
concepts are described, including the decision theory approach 
used for recognit ion. 
1 THE "WAI" AND THE "AIR" PROJECT 1 
The DAISY/ALIBABA system \ [1\ ] ,  \ [2 \ ] ,  \ [3 \ ] ,  as developed at the Technical University 
Darmstadt analyses abstracts and describes them according to the coordinate in- 
dexing philosophy using a prescribed set of descriptors. To perform this task, a 
domain dependent d ict ionary is needed. Estimating the non-existence of sui tably 
sized dict ionar ies to be one of the main problems for research and development of 
automatic indexing \ [4 \ ] ,  in 1978 the WAI project started with d ict ionary construc- 
t ion.  The two completed d ict ionar ies are 
? FST, covering the scope of food science and technology 3 and 
? PHYS, covering the scopeofPhysics, a part of INIS ( Internat ional  Nuclear 
Information ?ystem) 4 . - - 
Dif ferent procedures for generating dict ionary data were developed and applied. 
To c lass i fy  them and to unify the created data is one of the main tasks of d ict ion-  
ary construction (described in detai l  in \ [3 \ ] ,  \ [4 \ ] ) .  This cannot be done without 
examination of the i r  influence on the qua l i ty  of the result ing indexing. To perform 
indexing tests,  the development of DAISY and ALIBABA was another important objec- 
t ive  of WAI. 
Indexing results are reported in \ [4 \ ] ,  \ [5 \ ] ,  \[6\] which are based on consistency tests 
only, using the manual indexing as a standard. To confirm or to modify these re- 
sults,  the AIR project is now preparing a ret r ieva l  test on the physics data base 
INKA-PHYS of the Fachinformationszentrum FIZ 4 (Energie, Physik, Mathematik; Karls- 
ruhe) (order of magnitude: I0.000 documents, 200 search requests). The indexing 
wi l l  be based upon the new dict ionary PHYS-2 which is to be constructed using about 
80.000 documents of the INKA-PHYS data base. 
2 THE BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE "WAI"/"AIR" APPROACH 
The WAI/AIR approach represents both a specif ic solution of  the indexing problem 
161 
162 G. KNORZ . 
and a general framework for  a wide class of problems within natural language pro- 
cessing and other f ie lds .  
This paper wil l  only give reference to details of the particular solution publi- 
shed elsewhere. The objective of this work is to present the general framework 
derivable from the basic principles underlying the WAI and the AIR project: 
(I) Knowledge bases are very important for problem solving. But to presuppose 
knowledge for an automatic system must notquestionits applicabil ity, caused 
by non-existent procedures for construction of knowledge bases of an indispens- 
able size. The real ist ic appropriate solution is the main aim rather than a 
perfect one. 
(2) Controlling the quality and expenditure of effort of a system must not wait 
until i t  is put into practice. System development has to be guided by a control 
derivable from the task to be performed, 
(3) The algorithms that make the bases of the procedure should not be assumed to be 
perfect. Applied to complex tasks, i t  is a fundamental fact that they are 
based on simplified models. 
The principles can be considered to be a guideline for designing application 
oriented systems. With good reason i t  is claimed that the quality of such a system 
can be determined by evaluation in application environments only (see for example 
\[7\], \[8\]). This cannot be done without empirical studies of the user-system inter- 
action. 
The paradigm of recognizing abstract objects presented here is an approach to 
integrate the evaluation aspect into system development. I t  is also an approach 
to problems, for which no perfect solutions exist or seem to be applicable. 
3 RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS 
3.1 THE DEFINITION OF THE RECOGNITION TASK 
The basic idea is to use the application environment i tse l f  to get an implicit 
description of the problem. Whenever talking about a particular application 
environment there is no other way then to take a conceptual model M E as a basis 
which determines the adequate concepts (see \[9 \],  or see also \[1015). 
Here, a conceptual model has to be formulated in this way, that i t  defines 
(abstract) objects (x ,k) ,  ~EX, k~K. ~ denotes those aspects of an object which 
can be observed d i rec t ly  with regard to the problem, K denotes a set of object 
classes. A model m E of the appl icat ion environment gives an imp l i c i t  de f in i t ion  
of the (recognit ion) problem, by forming a continuous stream of abstracts objects. 
To develop a recognition system (RS) is nothing more than the f inding of a suitable 
mapping e: x?e(x) that recognizes an actual x to be (x, e(x)). 
I f  the RS-mEinterface is identical to the system-user interface, then m E may refer 
to the user's judgement directly, to define the co-occurrence of ~ and k. 
RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS 163 
This is also adequate, whenever human cognitive capabilities are to be simulated. 
We give some examples: 
? Information retrieval can be based upon recognition of document-query relation- 
ships (described in \[6\]).  ~ can be represented by (d,f) where d denotes the 
document, f denotes the query, k may be in the most simple case a member of 
the set {is relevant, is not relevant}, refering to the user's judgement? 
? Expressions, possibly within the scope of a quantifier as well as hypotheses 
for inferences, can both be regarded as abstract objects. Determining the 
scope of a quantifier or drawing inferences can be based on the recognition 
of those objects by simulating human decisions? 
Two other examples are given - avoiding the simulation approach: 
? Complex tasks often require the testing of many hypotheses, which can be 
regarded as abstract objects, m E may refer to the final results of the 
processing. 
? In \[6\] a decision theory approach to optimal retrieval forms a basis for m E , 
defining the task of indexing as recognition of document-descriptor elation- 
ships? 
3.2 STRUCTURE OF THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
The structure of the recognition system as presented here makes evident tbat the 
recognition problem arises essentially at the interface of two models: 
? The (external) conceptual model M E defining the recognition problem. 
? The (internal) conceptual model M I used to describe the object with respect 
to the recognition task. 
M I is part of the recognition system (Figure 1). I t  structures the object using 
the knowledge base, so that al l  available aspects that may influence the decision 
of the RS are included. In many cases i t  also init iates the recognition process, 
i .e. i t  constructs the hypothesis, represented by the object. 
According to M I a formal description x of ~ is produced. We do not consider here 
'the nature of M I, that can be a sophisticated one with a strong theoretical 
foundation as well as a rather simple and heuristic one. Different models M I
might cause quite different recognition systems for the same task. The main point 
is, that M I leads to an object description instead of a decision. Another point 
is, that both models M E and M I are essentially independent? This fact causes every

system RS MI - provided i t  is a determinist ic  one - to make incorrect decisions 
in some cases. That means, an 'optimal recognit ion systems' cannot be defined 
without taking the number of cases causing fau l ts  into consideration or - more 
precisely - the s ta t i s t i ca l  properties of the appl icat ion environment represented 
by m E . The desision theory approach appropriate to the given s i tuat ion  is descri -  
bed in \ [5\]  and \ [6\ ]  with respect to the indexing problem. The approach requires that 
every single decision of RS is c lass i f ied .  This task is for  the most part ant i -  
cipated by M E , which defines the set of object classes K. K determines the scope 
of possible fau l ts .  Those can be weighted independently by a loss function c: 
(e(x) ,k)  +w. With the model m E given, a par t i cu la r  recognit ion system wi l l  cause 
an expected value E(w). The optimal system RS~!tvp i s the  resu l t  of searchingfor this  
RsMI E(w). I t  can be shown that the optimal decision RS~t(x  ) can which minimizes 
W 
be based on the res t r i c ted  probabi l i t ies  p (k lx ) .  The mappings ek(x ) = p(klx)can b( 
approximated by polynomial functions to be constructed automatical ly using a 
sample of objects (~,k).  This way has been choosen by the ALIBABA system, that 
uses polynomial c lass i f ie rs ,  adapted in the mean square sense \[11\] . The indexing 
results in \ [5\]  and \[6\]  demonstrate that - applied to the indexing problem - the 
recognit ion approach and in par t i cu la r  the method of approximation is adequate for  
the problem. 
4 DISCUSSION 
The approach of recognizing abstract objects is evaluated using the parad ig  nf 
automatic indexing. The model ~,I E refers - for  pract ica l  reasons - not to the 
RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS 165 
retrieval process but to the decisions of human indexers. I f  a consistency factor 
(comparing manual and automatic indexing) measures the quality of automatic in- 
dexing, the set K requires two elements only. I f  a more sophisticated evaluation 
is intended, the set K can be increased, according to the kind of faults that 
should be considered. The classification of faults can for example depend on the 
descriptor under consideration. 
For the model M I used see for example \[5\] and \[12\]. 
We summarize the essentials of the suggested approach (the f i r s t  point refers in 
particular to the indexing paradigm). 
- The recognition problem causes one to regard two independent models: one with 
respect to retrieval and one with respect to analysis of abstracts. This point 
of view is important for an approach to optimal indexing \[6 \], but i t  is not 
self-obvious. In \[14\] the retrieval oriented approach of Robertson and the 
indexing oriented approach of Harter \[13\] are brought together. The result is 
a one model approach l ike also other approaches in this f ield (for example 
\ [15\]) .  
- The internal  model M I is restr icted to the base of the decision to be made. 
This fact makes i t  very easy to add i t iona l ly  include a lo t  of knowledge and 
heur ist ic  procedures, that might play a role only for decision making. There 
is no risc of causing faults  by determining how to compute the decision, using 
this knowledge.Art i f ic ia l  inte l l igence approaches use a correspondant model M I 
to determine the decision \[1G\]. 
- The need for  a model m E implies an educational aspect with respect to evaluation. 
ensures, that the gap between the optimal system RsM~ t and the ideal m E system 
(equivalent to mE) is.under control .
