ABSTRACT 
This paper addresses the problem of how to provide support for the acquisition, 
formalization, refinement, retrieval - in other words, for the management - of the 
knowledge required for producing high-quality terminology. This problem will become 
increasingly significant as term banks evolve into knowledge bases. Knowledge 
management for terminology-intensive activities is complicated by two factors: 1) the 
importance of encyclopedic as well as lexical-semantic knowledge, and 2) the wide 
spectrum of working environments in which terminological ctivities can be carried out, 
from terminology as a distinct specialization atone end of the spectrum, to terminology as 
practised in document-production at the other. In the first two sections of the paper, we 
briefly analyze ach of the two complicating factors. In the third section, we describe the 
terminological support hat is currently available and under development in a knowledge 
management tool called CODE, which is being used to build a prototype, knowledge- 
based term bank called COGNITERM, designed to be useful across a spectrum of 
terminology-intensive environments. 
. LEXICAL-SEMANTIC AND ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE IN 
TERMINOLOGY 
Terminology is the practical discipline concerned with describing and naming 
concepts in specialized domains. The data produced by this process is, increasingly, stored 
in data bases known as term banks. Since concepts are the starting point for all practical 
terminology work, and since concepts are the building-blocks of knowledge, it follows that 
terminology is a very knowledge-intensive activity: describing concepts involves acquiring 
knowledge about heir characteristics, and naming concepts involves matching conceptual 
characteristics with linguistic forms (i.e. terms). In fact, terminology is somewhat of a 
misnomer: most fundamentally, it is not the study of "terms", but rather of the knowledge 
conveyed by the terms. 
Given the crucial role of knowledge in terminology, one needs to address the 
question of what kind of knowledge to include in term banks. In the related iscipline of 
lexicography, the same question, formulated in relation to dictionaries and lexicons, has 
resulted in the long-standing debate about differences between lexical-semantic (i.e. 
linguistic) and encyclopedic (i.e. world, extra-linguistic) knowledge (1). One viewpoint 
has been that dictionaries and encyclopedias should be conceived as distinct entities - hence 
the apothegm "dictionaries are about words, encyclopedias re about hings". Meaning- 
Text (MT) Lexicography (Mel'cuk 1988a/b), for example, makes a strict distinction 
between lexical-semantic and encyclopedic knowledge on the basis of semantic features: 
those which are necessary and sufficient (in the mathematical sense) to a definition are 
lexical-semantic, while those that are superfluous are encylopedic, and banned from 
20 
definitions. A contrasting point of view, expressed for example by McArthur (1986:pp. 
102-109) is that for certain purposes, it may be useful to produce ahybrid of dictionary and 
encyclopedia - in other words, an encyclopedic dictionary. McArthur proposes that the 
dictionary-encyclopedia rel tionship be seen as a continuum rather than a dichotomy, and 
proposes the term micro-lexicography to designate the activity dealing with "the world of 
words...", and the term macro-lexicography to designate the activity which "shades out 
into the world of things and subjects, and centres on compendia of knowledge...". 
Depending on the lexicographic framework and the intended user of the dictionary, 
a strict differentiation between lexical-semantic and encyclopedic knowledge can be not 
only theoretically interesting, but also practically relevant: in the MT framework, for 
example, it underlies virtually all aspects of lexicographic methodology. Learners' 
dictionaries, on the other hand, whether they are aimed at learners of the mother tongue 
(i.e. children's dictionaries) or learners of a foreign language, typically feature 
encyclopedic characteristics, such as pictures and a rich supply of examples, that are 
intended to supplement definitions. Furthermore, the definitions themselves may include 
information that exceeds the bounds of "necessary and sufficient". 
The lexical-semantic vs. encyclopedic debate is pertinent to terminology since this 
discipline is closely linked to lexicography in purpose and method. In our view, 
terminology is clearly macro-lexicographic (to use McArthur's term) in orientation: term 
banks must include not only necessary and sufficient information about concepts, but also a 
certain amount of encyclopedic nformation as well. The following are just some of the 
reasons for our view: 
Relationship to specialized omains. Terminology is closely related to the 
specialized omains of activity whose lexica it describes. This is reflected in the basic 
organization of term banks according to specialized omains (i.e. subject fields). Until 
recently, most terminology work was done by domain experts, and the increasing numbers 
of terminologists who are not domain experts till consider consultation with experts to be 
crucial to their work. One of the goals of terminology is to provide assistance in the 
ordering and use of terms within specialized omains. Because of its relationship to 
languages for special purposes (LSPs), terminology has a need for subject classification 
and thesaural structure. In other words, it is closely linked to information science, with 
which it shares tools such as keywords, indexes and thesauri. 
The role of term banks as learning tools. Although term banks can be consulted by 
users with a wide range of domain expertise, by far the bulk of users are not domain 
experts. The largest user group has always been translators, who consult erm banks not 
only for strictly linguistic information (e.g. part-of-speech, morphology, target-language 
equivalent), but also for conceptual information (e.g. conceptual characteristics, relations to 
other concepts), since it is well known that a certain depth of understanding of the domain 
is necessary to use its terminology correctly. Term banks can be seen as learning tools for 
the terminologists themselves, for example, when they are assigned a new field in which 
they have little knowledge, or when they are working in a field that is highly influenced by 
neighboufing fields with which they are not very familiar. Because of the teaching role of 
term banks, definitions are often complemented byexamples of terms in context, much in 
the same way that learners' dictionaries are. Like encyclopedias, terminological 
publications often include pictures and diagrams. 
The multilingual spect of terminology. All the large term banks that currently exist 
are multilingual, and this tendency will most likely remain in the face of the increasing 
importance of international communication for trade and knowledge communication. It is 
well known that establishing lexical equivalence between different languages i  often 
impossible on the basis of lexical-semantic information alone. To take a well-known 
example from general anguage, the word river is defined in Webster's Ninth New 
Collegiate Dictionary as "a natural stream of water of considerable volume". French, 
however, distinguishes between flowing bodies of water that empty into the ocean (fleuve) 
21 
and those that empty into a lake or another flowing body of water (rividre) - information 
that would be considered encyclopedic f one applied the necessary-and-sufficient rule.
The need for multifun~tional term banks. In keeping with the increasing emphasis 
on the shareability of lexical resources in general, term banks will have to aim at meeting 
the needs of more and more user types, including machines (Freibott and Heid 1990, 
McNaught 1990, Meyer 1991). Machine uses (e.g. machine translation, expert systems, 
NL interfaces to databases) will require very large quantities of explicitly represented 
conceptual information, since they do not possess much of the world knowledge that 
humans know implicitly. 
Because of the important encyclopedic dimension of terminology, we feel that a 
term bank can be conceived as a kind of knowledge base, and we are currently in the 
process of designing aprototype knowledge-based term bank, called COGNITERM, in the 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Ottawa, Canada. COGN1TERM will 
be constructed using a knowledge ngineering tool called CODE (Conceptually Oriented 
Design Environment, Skuce et al 1989), that has already been tested in two terminology- 
intensive environments, where a number of small knowledge bases (several hundred 
concepts) were constructed. Before discussing the research in progress for the 
COGNITERM project (Section 3), we will briefly describe some of the knowledge 
management needs that our research isaiming to fill. 
. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT NEEDS ACROSS THE 
TERMINOLOGY SPECTRUM 
As explained above, the knowledge management problem in terminology is 
heightened by the fact that persons doing terminology need to manage both lexical-semantic 
and encyclopedic knowledge. This problem is further complicated by the fact that 
terminology is a very heterogeneous discipline, since the naming and description of 
specialized concepts can be carried out in a wide spectrum of working environments, 
dictating various types of knowledge management support. At one end of this spectrum is
what we might call the most "pure" form of terminology, namely terminology practised as 
a distinct specialization. In this type of environment, we find persons officially designated 
as terminologists, often with professional training and/or certification in terminology (2), 
following a controlled methodology (3). At the other end of the spectrum we find a much 
more "casual" form of terminology as it is practised as a component of document- 
production. Here, the naming and description of concepts i  carried out at various "links" 
in a "chain" of activities, which can include product design specification, technical writing 
(e.g. user manuals), revision, proofreading, translation, management information, etc. 
Normally, many of the persons involved in these activities have no specialized training in 
terminology, their methodology can be highly informal, and there may be no centralized 
repository for the terminological data. 
The technology and methodology we are developing for terminology-oriented 
knowledge management support are intended to be generic enough to be useful across the 
spectrum of terminology environments. The various knowledge management (KM) needs 
that characterize the two ends of the spectrum are examined in turn below. 
2.1 Termino logy  as a Dist inct Special izat ion 
This type of environment is typified by organizations such as the Department of the 
? Secretary of State of Canada, which has had an official terminology service since 1953, 
22 
employing up to 80 staff terminologists preparing up to 4,000 terminology records a week 
(4). The mission of these terminologists i to facilitate the proper use of terms, in English 
and French, throughout the Public Service of Canada. To this end, terminologists maintain 
what is now the largest erm bank in the world (about one million database records). They 
also prepare bilingual glossaries (which are often published) on subject areas requested by 
clients, and respond to inquiries from clients on specific problems. The terminological data 
that is collected can be conceptual or linguistic (5): conceptual data includes information 
such as subject-field labels, synonyms and antonyms, definitions, and equivalents in the 
second language; linguistic data includes information such as part-of-speech, 
morphological anomalies, usage labels, and idiomatic expressions. Terminologists in 
environments such as this one most often work thematically (6): in other words, they 
collect and describe (as exhaustively as practical constraints allow) the specialized terms 
used in a given field. 
The major challenge of terminology is conceptual, not linguistic: terminologists are 
trained in linguistics and thus are properly prepared for the linguistic dimension of their 
task; in contrast, they are not normally domain experts, yet they require a substantial 
amount of expert knowledge in order to do their work. In other words, the major difficulty 
is pinning down the meanings of terms. Compounding their problem is the fact that 
terminologists can be required to work in several fields simultaneously, or to change fields 
frequently depending on clients' needs. 
In the following paragraphs, we summarize (7) the four components of a 
terminologist's work in terms of the KM tasks on the one hand, and the roles of this 
knowledge in the production of terminology records on the other. 
2.1.1 Selection of documentation 
KM tasks. Before any collection or analysis of terms can occur, terminologists 
must select he knowledge sources for the project. Given their linguistic orientation, they 
have traditionally preferred texts as knowledge sources, although the collaboration of 
experts is also highly valued. Before collecting the documentary corpus, terminologists 
acquire some general knowledge about the field by doing introductory reading in 
textbooks, encyclopedia rticles, popularizing journals, etc. They begin to familiarize 
themselves with the general knowledge structures of the field, trying to determine its 
boundaries, subdivisions, and areas of overlap with other fields (for multidisciplinary 
fields). Often, at this stage, terminologists will sketch out these "skeletal" knowledge 
structures in the form of a concept network. They will also make mental or written notes 
on a number of individual concepts which emerge as being particularly important. 
Roles of knowledge. These preliminary KM activities are crucial to the selection of 
the documentary corpus since they help to clarify the project's cope: a clear idea of the 
conceptual boundaries of the field helps delimit the range of documentation to be sought. 
Determining areas of overlap with other fields also helps terminologists establish links with 
related documentation. When the terminologists are ready to begin the search for the 
documentary corpus, a clear idea of the major subfields helps them orient their work along 
a number of documentary "paths", which may be priontized according to users' needs. 
The names of subfields, of key concepts, and of the characteristics of these concepts help 
provide specific points of entry into the documentation. Having a general idea of the 
hierarchical structure of the field also helps orient the process of documentation selection 
since terminologists end to proceed from general to more specific literature. 
Once a preliminary corpus is obtained, their general knowledge of the domain 
provides terminologists with a yardstick for judging its quality. It also helps them classify 
documentation according to subfield. In multilingual terminology, classification according 
to subfield is particularly important: to "manage" the large amounts of documentation tobe 
scanned (see 2.1.2 below), terminologists very often work on one subfield at a time, in 
one language and then in the other, before proceeding to another subfield. 
23 
Finally, these preliminary conceptual activities provide terminologists with the 
conceptual framework and basic terminology needed for communicating with librarians and 
other documentation resource persons, as well as with experts. Communication is 
particularly important in the case of experts (8), who tend to be very busy: if 
terminologists have done their "homework", they will be able to direct he conversation i  
order to elicit the maximum information i  a minimum amount of time. "Starting out on 
the right foot" in this way boosts terminologists' credibility with experts, and increases 
their chances of convincing experts to remain involved as the project advances. 
2.1.2 Establishment of a nomenclature 
KM tasks. Once the documentation has been selected, it undergoes a process called 
scanning, i.e. careful reading, with the extraction (9) of potential terms along with their 
contexts (10). Additional research may be needed for specific problems (e.g. terms not 
found for concepts identified, terms with inadequate contexts), after which the data is 
organized by grouping the various instances of a term, noting obvious cases of synonymy, 
abbreviations, usage labels, etc. Through the scanning process, terminologists begin to 
analyze (11) the general knowledge structures of the field, fleshing out (whether on paper 
or in the mind) the skeletal concept network drafted uring their background reading. They 
also begin to analyze the conceptual characteristics of individual terms (i.e. the terms found 
in the documentation), based on the contexts in which the terms appear. 
Roles of knowledge. Drawing on their general understanding of the domain, 
terminologists begin identifying the lexical items that are specific to their field. This 
process involves eliminating terms that would constitute "noise" in the terminology, i.e. 
lexical items that belong to general rather than specialized vocabulary, or terms that do not 
fall within the established boundaries of the field. As well, terminologists must identify 
what are known as "silences," i.e. lacunae in the preliminary terminology. As 
terminologists prepare to finalize the nomenclature (i.e. to determine the terms for which 
records will be prepared) and decide which contexts will be retained for analysis (2.1.3), 
the conceptual framework acquired so far will help them continue to communicate about 
problem areas with documentation resource persons and domain experts. 
2.1.3 Preparation of term records 
KM tasks. Using the established terminology and associated contexts, 
terminologists can begin a systematic analysis of terms-in-context. The primary function of 
this analysis is to determine the meanings of the terms, although it also serves to identify 
other linguistic characteristics such as part-of-speech, gender, frequency, geographic 
origin, etc. The conceptual goal at this stage is to achieve the depth of understanding 
needed to complete the term records. Terminologists carefully analyze the various contexts 
in which the terms have been found in order to identify a certain number of conceptual 
characteristics for all concepts. These characteristics will then be compared with those of 
potentially related concepts (e.g. synonyms, equivalents in the other language) in order to 
determine those which are necessary for establishing a conceptual match. 
Roles of knowledge. The most important application of conceptual analysis is 
definition construction. If they are attempting the classic intensional (i.e. genus-differentia) 
definition, terminologists will need to compare the characteristics of a given concept with 
those of concepts at the same hierarchical level (i.e. with the characteristics of the co- 
ordinate concepts (12)) in order to determine the distinguishing characteristics (i.e. the 
differentia in an intensional definition). Relations other than the generic-specific (e.g. 
whole-part, cause-effect, tool-function) may also be analyzed and reflected in definitions. 
Conceptual nalysis is also essential to identifying synonyms and equivalents in the 
second language. Identifying synonyms requires a careful comparison of conceptual 
characteristics n order to determine that these are indeed identical for the terms in question. 
24 
When two concepts differ in only a very few (and not very significant) characteristics, they 
may be designated as pseudosynonyms (e.g. one concept may have one more characteristic 
than another, and thus be more specific). Establishing a conceptual match is also crucial to 
multilingual terminology work, which is complicated by the fact that conceptual structures 
often do not correspond perfectly from one language to another, resulting in cases of 
incomplete equivalence. Sometimes there may be no equivalent in the other language at all, 
resulting in the need to create a neologism (13). In this case, conceptual analysis is 
essential for determining whether the concept already exists within the current knowledge 
structures of the target language, and when it does, what its characteristics are (since the 
concept is so new, its characteristics, and consequently itslocation within the knowledge 
structures, may still be fluctuating). In many cases, an existing term will be adopted to 
designate the new concept, and conceptual nalysis of the candidate terms is essential for 
determining which one possesses the greatest emantic compatibility with the new concept. 
2.1.4 Quality control 
KM tasks. Quality control can be achieved by two types of activity: revision and 
updating. On the one hand, before the project is completed, the various types of 
information collected by the terminologist are revised by domain experts and other 
terminologists (e.g. terminologists with experience in neighbouring or related fields, or 
more experienced terminologists). On the other hand, after the project is completed, a 
periodic updating of terminology records can occur whenever this is justified by changes 
and expansion in the domain. Revising the results of a terminology project involves 
analyzing and discussing specific conceptual problems identified by the experts and/or 
other terminologists. Periodic updating implies a monitonng of changes in knowledge 
structures and conceptual characteristics. 
Roles of knowledge. To facilitate revision, terminologists need a sound 
understanding of the domain in order to interpret feedback from experts, and to elicit 
information on this feedback (e.g. when terminologists do not understand feedback, when 
the feedback contradicts what the terminologists found, or when experts give conflicting 
feedback). Regarding updating, a clear understanding of the current state of the knowledge 
will give the terminologist a basis for comparison when new structures and conceptual 
characteristics emerge. Conceptual problems increase when a field is particularly large or 
has complex knowledge structures, or when the field is changing rapidly. 
2.2 Terminology as a Component of Document-Production 
By document-production, we mean a "chain" of writing activities that are carried 
out from the inception of a product (14) to the production of public (or widely available) 
written information about his product. The "links" in a document-production chain can be 
distributed throughout an organization, and the actual "documents" in various states of 
completion. These documents can include anything from product designers' rough 
personal notes, to intermediate "current state" documents used to coordinate members of a 
team, to "official" publications (e.g. technical manuals produced by technical writers), to 
translations of these official publications. 
Although there are usually no officially designated terminologists in this type of 
environment, terminology-intensive activities are pervasive nonetheless: concepts are 
described and named by persons such as product designers, technical writers, 
proofreaders, revisers, abstracters, management information specialists, public relations 
officers, and translators (15). Given the heterogeneity of this type of environment, the 
terminology-related KM problems are much more complex than they are in the "purer" 
form of terminology work described above. The following are just some of the issues that 
contribute to this complexity. 
25 
2.2.1 Methodology 
Given the variety of people involved in document-production, this kind of 
environment typically exhibits a lack of consistent methodology for terminology work. 
This problem is particularly crucial at the early stages of document-production. For 
example, product designers carry a heavy burden of defining and naming concepts, but 
have no formal training (and very often, no interest!) in terminology. Terms that are 
chosen "on the fly" easily become ntrenched, even though they may be inappropriate. 
Normally, this type of environment does not stress a methodology for assuring that terms 
are clearly described and logically named, nor that the consistent use of approved 
terminology is enforced. 
2.2.2 Coordination between links in the document-production chain 
Given the number of people that can be involved in document-production, 
coordinating the various links in the chain is a fundamental problem. Writers in a given 
link in the chain may, for example, have trouble understanding what the originator of 
certain terms actually meant by them. If it is impossible to contact he originators of 
knowledge personally, the meanings of terms may have to be reconstructed from scant 
resources. Knowing that a given document will soon be passed on to another link in the 
chain, documentors are easily tempted not to resolve terminological problems that they have 
inherited, leading to a "pass-my-confusion-onto-the-next-person" phe omenon. 
Complicating things is that documents do not flow in a one-way direction from inception to 
finalization; documentors, consequently, can be sent in loops. Common terminological 
problems resulting from this situation are inconsistency (terms being used to mean different 
things by different people), and overloading. (terms used in too many different senses). 
Coordination is also complicated by the fact that concepts exist at different levels of 
"clarity" at the various links in the chain: at the initial design stage, they may still be quite 
fuzzy; by the time they are documented in some kind of "official" text, their conceptual 
characteristics should be (in pnnciple, at least!) much clearer. From a terminological point 
of view, this conceptual fluidity means a continuous evolution of concept definitions and 
names from one link in the document-production chain to the next. 
2.2.3 Centralization of terminological data 
Most organizations do not maintain centralized repositories (e.g. term banks) of 
terminological data. When such repositories do exist, they often take the form of informal 
glossaries that may be out of date, not validated by experts and/or professional writers, 
and not used consistently throughout the organization. This state of affairs places a heavy 
onus on the documentor to find out who originated certain terms, what the terms mean, 
how they should be used in context, how they should be translated, and so on. The lack of 
centralization f terminological data (particularly conceptual data) is particularly problematic 
for people who are at the end Of the document-production chain - for example, the editors, 
proofreaders, and translators (16): they are the furthest away from the originators of 
concepts (and have the hardest time accessing these originators); the documents passed on 
to them are likely to have the greatest number of terminological problems (due to the "pass- 
my-confusion-onto-the-next-person" phe omenon mentioned above); and finally, these 
people usually have the least amount of domain expertise (editors, proofreaders and 
translators are typically language xperts, not domain experts). A lack of centralized 
information about erms is also a drawback for newcomers to a project, since it forces them 
to acquire knowledge about erms almost from scratch. 
26 
3. A GENERIC TOOL FOR TERMINOLOGY-ORIENTED 
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
As has been argued elsewhere (e.g. Ahmad et al 1989, Czap and Nedobity 1990, 
Meyer and Paradis 1991, Parent 1989, Skuce and Meyer 1990a/b, Wijnands 1989), the 
knowledge management problems of terminology are not unique to this field. Rather, they 
are general problems of knowledge ngineenng that are now receiving extensive attention 
in the literature of AI. The AI research group at the University of Ottawa, Canada, has 
over the past few years developed a generic knowledge ngineering tool called CODE 
(Conceptually Oriented Design Environment, Skuce et al 1989), which is written in 
Smalltalk and runs on a Macintosh, 386 or UNIX platform. CODE can be described as a 
generic knowledge manager, designed to assist any person (including the non-expert) faced 
with the task of acquinng, formalizing, refining and accessing the knowledge structures of 
a specialized omain. CODE allows the user to construct a knowledge base which 
describes concepts in frame-like units called CDs (concept descriptors) that are normally, 
though not necessarily, arranged in inheritance hierarchies. 
CODE has been tested in two terminology applications: a bilingual vocabulary 
project at the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada (Meyer and Paradis 1991, 
Skuce and Meyer 1990a/b) and a software documentation project at Bell Northern 
Research, the Canadian counterpart of Bell Labs (Skuce 1991). These two environments 
correspond to the two ends of the terminology spectrum described above. Based on what 
we learned uring these experiences, we are now enhancing the system's terminological 
support in a new version of CODE (Version 4), expected to be operational in late 1991. 
Concurrently with system development, we are using CODE to build a prototype bilingual 
term bank, called COGNITERM, with a rich, highly structured and easily accessible 
knowledge component. In a nutshell, this term bank can be described as a hybrid between 
a traditional term bank (17) and a knowledge base. 
Since a general technical description of the current and forthcoming versions of 
CODE are found elsewhere (Skuce et al 1989, Skuce and Meyer 1991), we shall just 
outline below some of the features that are receiving particular attention i  light of the fact 
that we intend COGNITERM to facilitate the management of both lexical-semantic and 
encyclopedic information, and to be usable across the spectrum of terminology 
environments. 
User interface. Given the many different ypes of users that can be engaged in 
terminology-intensive activities, and the fact that we see a knowledge-based term bank as 
both a communication tool (e.g. between terminologists, between terminologists and 
experts, between the various "links" in a document-production "chain") and a teaching tool, 
the user interface has been a top priority in system development from the start. Hence, the 
current version of CODE is already user-tailorable, i.e., the same knowledge base is 
accessible in different manners for different purposes. For example, adomain expert or a 
terminologist who is highly experienced in a domain will have a different set of options 
than a learner. In the current version of CODE, we have also placed a strong emphasis on 
graphical representation. The system can easily produce various types of semantic net 
diagrams, for both hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations. The graphical display 
updates automatically when changes are made to the knowledge base, and offers 
mechanisms for focussing on certain parts of the knowledge base, highlighting special 
concepts (e.g. concepts that are uncertain, unconfirmed, etc.), and comparing and 
contrasting knowledge substructures. In CODE Version 4, Hypercard-like bit map images 
will be available, so that one can ask of a term "show me one", or of an image "what is this 
called?" 
Access to, and navigation through, the knowledge base. Since a knowledge base 
incorporates large amounts of encyclopedic nformation, and since different users will 
27 
require different information, it is important that the knowledge be easily accessible and 
navigable. A CODE knowledge base is essentially a hierarchically organized hypertext-like 
system, incorporating the notion of property inheritance. One may navigate in whatever 
manner is appropriate, with typical retracing abilities of hypertext systems. Unlike 
traditional term banks, in which access is strictly terminological (i.e. one must know a term 
in order to get conceptual information about it), CODE allows conceptual charactersfics to
be entry-points into the knowledge, so that one can ask questions like "what is the term for 
the machine with function X", "what is the term for the material with physical properties X, 
Y, Z?" Access to, and navigation through, the knowledge is facilitated by the graphical 
component described above, and also through a browsing capability. In Version 4, the 
browser will use a basic window whose behaviour is modelled after an outline processor, 
with the ability to dynamically expand and contract ree-structures. The user can easily 
tailor-make the browser to suit a given need. To facilitate the use of terms as entry-points 
into the knowledge, the current version of CODE has a search/rename browser that permits 
scanning of the entire knowledge base for every occurrence of a term, and can be restricted 
to certain contexts (e.g. concept names, names of conceptual characteristics, descriptions of 
conceptual characteristics) to speed up the search. Version 4 will include a clearly defined 
set of terminological "status levels", by which we mean attributes of a term such as how it 
is used (e.g. as a concept name or the name of a conceptual characteristic), whether it is 
defined or not, whether it is used in definitions but is not a knowledge base concept or 
property, etc. 
Informal, trial-and-error knowledge xperimentation. The system contains 
features, which we are still developing, for managing knowledge that is in different states 
of "clarity" (for want of a better term). Lack of clarity may be due to several causes: for 
example, a terminologist may be unclear about a concept because he/she does not have the 
domain expertise to understand it properly; a technical writer, translator, etc. in the 
document-production chain may be unclear about a concept because people at various 
preceding links in the chain have used a term inconsistently; a concept may be very new 
(e.g. in the case of neologisms) and thus intrinsically unclear; and so on. In all these 
situations, we find problems uch as what to call a concept, what the superconcept is,what 
subconcepts it has, what characteristics it has, what the similar concepts are. CODE 
permits rapid entry of hunches, guesses, trials, etc., followed by experimentation with the 
consequences of entering new knowledge. For example, superconcept links may be 
changed on the graph just by dragging, and the consequences can be seen immediately in
textual or graphical form. One may ask for "similar" concepts, or potential terminological 
conflicts. Previously made changes (up to three) can be discarded in one click. 
Multidimensionality. It is well known that concepts and entire knowledge 
structures can be "seen" from various "viewpoints" (18), which correspond roughly to the 
needs or interests of the knowledge base user. CODE offers a "masking" facility that 
allows one to restrict what is visible in the knowledge base by Boolean conditions on 
concepts and characteristics. For example, different users might require different ypes of 
knowledge about a certain laboratory procedure. CODE allows one user to say "show me 
only things about this laboratory procedure related to the tools that are required", and 
another to say "show me only things related to the types of organisms that the procedure 
can identify". The masking facility also allows the notion of viewpoint o be extended to 
include a notion of depth of domain expertise. For example, the user may request 
information about the laboratory procedure that would be of interest (and understandable) 
to a beginning biology student, or to a seasoned researcher. 
Ranking of conceptual characteristics. We are currently investigating the 
usefulness of ranking characteristics according to where they fall in the lexical- 
semantic/encyclopedic continuum. For certain purposes (e.g. users with different levels of 
domain expertise), it may be useful to at least distinguish between characteristics that are 
necessary and sufficient, those that are encyclopedic but useful to establishing interlingual 
28 
equivalence, and finally, all other encyclopedic characteristics. We are also investigating an 
algorithm proposed by Maybury (1990) for ranking characteristics according to concept 
similarity on the one hand (e.g. similarity of characteristics of co-ordinate concepts), and 
prototypicality on the other (e.g. the degree to which a concept's characteristics are 
reflected in its subordinate concepts), which offers the possibility of generating definitions 
of the genus-differentia type automatically. 
Multiple knowledge bases. Facilities for managing multiple knowledge bases 
(under development for Version 4) are required in order to work in multidisciplinary fields, 
and in order to work multilingually (since knowledge structures rarely correspond perfectly 
from one language to another). Both situations require support for isolating areas of 
correspondence and non-correspondence, and for comparing and contrasting. Multilingual 
work will require support for automatically generating some knowledge substructures (i.e. 
those that do correspond for the most part); eventually, this would involve a machine 
translation component. CODE already includes a general high-level ontology, which is 
being regularly refined; it will eventually serve as a basis for integrating knowledge bases. 
Quality control. The envisaged use of the system by various persons in a 
terminology environment ecessitates a ophisticated capacity for quality control. CODE 
offers a capacity for detecting conceptual inconsistencies of various types, carrying out type 
checking, flagging entries as to source, entry person, date, state of correctness, etc. 
Database-like r trieval facilities permit queries uch as "show me all entries about laser 
printers made by X since last month and not yet approved". In order to ensure 
terminological consistency, CODE offers a number of features for assisting users in 
naming a conceptual characteristic (acommon terminological problem in knowledge base 
building). The system can display all currently used names of similar properties (e.g. all 
properties belonging to the same category of property), and will prompt if this property 
name has already been used elsewhere. 
SUMMARY 
We have described two issues that must be considered in the development of 
technology for managing knowledge in terminology-intensive environments: 1) the 
importance of encyclopedic as well as lexical-semantic knowledge, and 2) the wide 
spectrum of working environments in which terminological ctivities can be carried out. 
We have also described a number of features currently available and under development in 
a generic knowledge management tool called CODE. Many of the ideas described 
represent work in progress related to the design of a prototype knowledge-based term bank 
using the CODE system. The problems are difficult, and our ideas constantly evolving: 
any comments on this work would therefore be warmly welcomed.

NOTES 
1. Discussions of this debate as it has been articulated within a lexicographic framework 
can be found, for example, in Bierwisch and Kiefer 1970, Haiman 1980, Frawley 1981. 
More references can be found in Haiman 1980. 
2. In Canada, most erminologists have university-level training in Translation, since most 
of them do bilingual (French-English) terminology. Some universities ven offer an M.A. 
in Terminology. Canada's largest professional organization of translators, the Socidtd es 
traducteurs du Qudbec, offers a standardized xam for certification i terminology. 
3. For example, at the Terminology and Linguistics Services Directorate ofthe Department 
of the Secretary of State of Canada, an 85-page handbook prescribes the methodology. 
Questions of methodology are also outlined in some well-known textbooks on 
terminology, e.g. Rondeau 1984, Wiister 1974, Sager 1990. 
4. A general overview of the Terminology and Linguistic Services Directorate can be 
found in Gawn 1990. 
5. We use the term linguistic (in opposition to conceptual) in the very general sense of 
'related to the terms, as opposed to the concepts designated by the terms'. Of course, any 
attempt to separate terms from concepts, while useful for analysis, is fundamentally 
artificial: terms and concepts are intimately inked. 
6. Thematic is opposed to term-oriented. In the latter type of terminology, work is done 
on isolated terms, normally in response to specific requests from clients. 
7. A more detailed analysis can be found in Meyer 1991. 
8. In effect, terminologists experience most of the problems of expertise licitation 
summarized, for example, in Gaines 1990. 
9. Semi-automation of the scanning process in terminology is the object of considerable 
research interest at the moment. For an overview, cf. Auger 1989. Eventually, the 
knowledge management tool we envision would be integrated with technology for semi- 
automated scanning. 
10. Noting a variety of contexts for the terms is extremely important in terminology, since 
contextual nalysis is the principal way in which terminologists determine the meanings of 
terms, and also how they are used in context. Most term banks include some contexts in 
the terminology records. 
11. We say begin to analyze because analysis is still not very deep at this stage, given that 
scanning involves rather fast reading. The cognitive processes that occur at this stage are 
30 
not yet very well understood, but we are assuming that some level of analysis, even if it is 
partly unconscious, does happen. 
12. According to the ISO International Standard 1087, a co-ordinate concept is a "concept 
in a hierarchical system which ranks at the same level as one or more other concepts." 
13. A neologism is a term that is used in a new sense. Sometimes existing terms can be 
used (and just given an additional sense), and sometimes a totally new term is coined. 
14. For terminological simplicity, we use the term product o include things like services, 
regulations, committee decisions, etc. (and not just products in the strictest sense of the 
term). 
15. A more detailed overview of the various types of writing activities in a document- 
production chain can be found in Language Technology (April 1989, Special Issue on 
Documentation). 
16. Terminological problems are such an impediment to translation, and particularly to 
machine translation, that many organizations are starting to impose an in-house "controlled 
language" on their technical writers. An interesting overview of this phenomenon can be 
found in Pogson 1988. 
17. The traditional term bank we are using as a model is TERMIUM III, the Secretary of 
State's bilingual (French-English) term bank. COGNITERM will include all the 
information categories currently available in TERMIUM. 
18. This idea is very similar to "view" in Murray and Porter 1989.
