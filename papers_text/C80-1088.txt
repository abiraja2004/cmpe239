Abstract 
This paper describes a model for the 
automated morphological analysis of Bahasa 
Malaysia (the Malay language) via the ATEF 
system, a component of the mechanical 
translation system known as ARIANE, which was 
developed by G.E.T.A. at Grenoble. This model 
serves two purposes, that is, to test the 
capability of handling Bahasa Malaysia 
morphological analysis using ATEF and also to 
provide a first working model. 
This grammar covers the three main 
morphological processes in Bahasa Malaysia 
analysis, that is, affixation, reduplication 
and compounding. 
Reduplication is the process whereby a 
base or some part of the base is repeated. 
There are three types of reduplication - 
proper, rhyming and chiming. Reduplication 
of nouns generally gives a semantic category 
of heterogeneity or indefinite plural while 
reduplication of verbals result in one of the 
following semantical features: repetition, 
continuity, habituality, intensity, extensive- 
ness and resemblance. 
Compound forms are constructions that have 
two or three free forms as their constituents 
and each of the constituent forms may either 
be a rootform or derived form. 
Affixation is a morphological process 
whereby a base may be extended by one or more 
affixes. Affixes may be classified as prefixe~ 
suffixes, infixes and circumfixes. Multiple 
affixation is also not uncommon in Bahasa 
Malaysia though no construction exceeds three 
layers of affixation. Several features are 
obtained through affixation. On affixation, 
morphographemic changes may occur depending on 
the initial segment of the rootform, word 
classes of the derived words are set and also 
semantical features are set. The setting of 
semantical features may be further complicated 
as a result of multiple affixation. 
Unlike affixation, the handling of 
reduplication and compounding do not present 
much of a problem for ATEF and is quite 
straightforward. Affixation is a more 
complicated process but also a more important 
process. 
A simple finite state diagram is used to 
depict the basic overall structure for the 
handling of multiple affixation as a more 
detailed finite state diagraw is not 
justifiable. 
Morphographemic changes occur mainly with 
the prefixes pe N and me N in which different 
allomorphs are ~sed depending on the initial 
segments of the derived word. On deletion of 
these allomorphs to obtain the resultant form, 
segments may have to be added to the resultant 
form, the form remains unchanged or sub- 
stituted. This means that rules have to be 
provided for the treatment of each of these 
allomorphs individually. 
The main word classes in Bahasa Malaysia 
are nominals, verbals, auxiliaries, adverbals 
and particles and these again can be sub- 
categorised. The word class of a derived word 
is dependent on its affix and on affix deletion 
to obtain the rootform, its word class is set. 
For multiple affixation, the outermost prefix 
(if any) determines the word class. 
Affixation also results in modifications 
or additional semantical features. Each affix 
carries a set of possible semantical features. 
For example, the prefix pe N may cause the 
wordform to be agentive, i~strumental, the 
object of action, etc. Which is the correct 
'role' depends on the base on which the prefix 
was attached. In this model, no decision is 
made as to which semantical feature is the 
correct one. Instead, the whole set of 
features are set when the affix has been 
detected. 
Although it may be possible to sub- 
categorise the word classes into groups with 
common semantical features, this model so far 
only considers grouping according to word 
classes and does not consider subgroupings for 
semantical features. Work is now in progress 
to include such subgrouping to provide a more 
complete morphological analysis of Bahasa 
Malaysia. This model not only handles these 
three main morphological processes, but also 
handles idiomatic expressions as well. On 
completion of morphological analysis, all the 
information gathered is submitted to the next 
stage of the ARIANE system, that is, the 
syntactical analysis stage in order to build 
up a more complete 'picture' of Bahasa 
Malaysia.

IntrodUction 
The Malay language has been the national 
language of Malaysia since 1955 and with the 
formation of Malaysia in 1963, it has been 
known as Bahasa Malaysia (B.M.). B.M. belongs 
to the Western Group of the Austronesian 
Family and is spoken by people through Malaysia, 
Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei. There are a 
number of 'varieties' of B.M. - the regional 
type, pidginised B.M. as well as standard B.M., 
that is, that ~variety' used formally and 
official in government establishments, formal 
institutions as well as in mass communication. 
The morphological analysis described in this 
paper is based on this particular variety, that 
is, standard B.M. 
B.M. uses both the Romanised and Arabic 
scripts for its writing system. For this 
purpose, the Roman script proposed in 'Pedoman 
Umum Ejaan Bahasa Malaysia 'I will be used. 
This system was an attempt to standardise the 
spelling system of both B.M. and the Indonesian 
language. 
This paper suggests a morphological model 
for B.M. using the ATEF system which was 
developed by the GETA group at Universite 
Scientifique et Medicale Grenoble~ The ATEF 
system is part of an interactive system known 
as ARIANE-78. AKIANE-78 is a software tool 
for machine-aided translation to which 
linguistic data (grammars, dictionaries, 
heuristic) formalised in some external artifi- 
cial language is given. It includes the 
following components: 
i. ATEF " a non-deterministic finite 
state transducer which is used for 
generating programs for morphological 
analysis. 
2. ROBRA - a tree-to-tree transducer 
which is used for multi-level analysis 
(syntax and partial semantics), for 
the structural transfer and also for 
syntactic generation in the target 
language. 
3. TRANSF - a system for bi-lingual 
dictionary look-up. It is used for 
lexieal transfer. 
4. SYGMOR - a deterministic finite state 
transducer used for morphological 
generation. 
This paper describes the modelling of 
this linguistic data to be supplied to ATEF 
for morphological analysis. No attempt has 
been made to describe in detail the usage nor 
the writing of the external artificial 
language for ATEF as the purpose of this model 
is to test the capability of handling B.M. 
morphological analysis under ATEF and also to 
provide a first working model for B.M. 
In the sections that follow, a morpholo- 
gical description of B.M. will be given, 
followed by the morphological model. 
B.M. Grammar 
The morphological description given here 
is taken mainly from 'The Morphology of Malay'~ 
There are three main morphological 
processes in B.M., that is, reduplication, 
compounding and affixation. 
Reduplication 
Reduplication is the process whereby a 
base or some part of the base is repeated. 
In B.M. there are two types of reduplication: 
reduplication proper and rhyming and chiming. 
Reduplication proper may be partial or full. 
For partial reduplication, the duplicate is 
determined by the initial or final syllable 
of the base. In initial syllable reduplication, 
only the initial consonant of the base 
(provided it begins with a consonant) is 
repeated while the rest of the duplicate is of 
constant shape (i.e., -ek). In final syllable 
reduplication, the last syllable is repeated 
without any change. For example, 
budak 'child' ~ bek-budak 'children' 
(initial syllable) 
dak-budak ' children' 
(final syllable) 
Partial duplication generally occurs only 
in colloquial B.M. whereas full duplication 
occurs in standard B.M. 
In full duplication, the duplicate is 
identical to the whole base. For example, 
budak 'child' ~ budak-budak 'children' 
Rhyming and chiming is also called 
reduplication with phonetic change. A compound 
form is called rhyming if one syllable of the 
base is repeated in the duplicate, example, 
k~i_h 'cake' ~ k~mH~h 'variety of cakes' 
and chiming if all the consonants are repeated 
in the duplicate and only the vowels changes, 
example, 
~-579 - 
~HEEE~ 'mountain' ~ su_n_un~xsanan $ 
'variety of mountains' 
Generally, proper reduplication of nouns 
gives a semantic category of heterogenity or 
indefinite plural while rhyming and chiming 
has the added feature of variety. As for 
verbals, proper reduplication may result in at 
least one of the following semantical features: 
repetition, continuity, habituality, intensity, 
extensiveness and resemblance. For example, 
baca 'to read' ~ baca-baca 
.... 'to read repeatedly/ 
continually/always' 
kunin$ 'to be yellow' ~ kunin$Ek~n~n$ 
'to be very yellow/ 
yellowish/yellow all over/ 
always' 
When occurring with dynamic verbs, 
rhyming and chiming gives the semantical 
function of repetition, example, 
beli 'to buy' ~ beli-belah 
.... 'to buy again and again' 
and that of intensification when occurring with 
stative verbs, example, 
malu 'to be shy' ~malu-malah  
'to be very shy' 
Compounding 
A compound form is a construction that has 
two or three free forms as its constituents 
where each of the constituent forms may be 
either a root or a derived form, example, 
k~_~ 'firewood' 
(ka~H 'wood' and a~ 'fire') 
suratkhabar 'newspaper' 
(surat 'letter' and khabar 'news') 
Affixation 
Affixation is the process whereby a base 
may be extended by one or more affixes. 
Affixation is the most common and widely used 
of the three morphological processes. Affixes 
may be classified as prefixes, suffixes, 
infixes and circumfixes. 
Prefixes 
The more common prefixes in B.M. include 
~, ~,  ~,  E~, ~, ~,  ~,  ~_E, ~_~, 
ke. This list of prefixes with the exception of 
p~ N and me N do not result in any morpho- 
gr~phemic changes. Prefixes me N and pe N 
take on different forms (its al~omorphs)-- 
depending on the initial segment of the root- 
forms. For example, for the prefix meN,  its 
allomorphs are: 
1. me - used with the letters i, m, n, ng, 
ny, r, w, y 
2. mere - used with b, p, f, v (f and p 
dropped) 
3. men - used with d, t, c, j, z (t dropped) 
4. meng - vowels, g, h, k (k dropped) 
5. meny - s (s dropped) 
6. menge - for monosyllabic forms. 
Examples: 
i. me N + lawat 'to visit' ~ melawat 'to visit' 
2. me__N + ~k~!  'to hit' ~ memukul 'to hit' 
3. me N + cari 'to find' ~ mencari 'to find' 
4. me N + kacau 'to disturb' ~ mensa~a~ 
'to disturb' 
5. me N 
6. me N 
+ ~ 'to sweep' ~m~_n~a~ 'to sweep' 
+ ~a~ 'to paint' ~ mense~at 'to paint' 
The same rules hold for the prefix pe_N. 
Suffixes 
The addition of suffixes do not present 
such morphographemic changes. Suffixes are 
merely attached to the rootform without any 
changes being made to the suffix nor the root ~ 
form. Four 'layers' of suffixes are possible 
in B.M., that is, from the innermost layer 
outwards, we have: 
I. an, wan, wati, man, is, isma 
2. i, kan 
3. mu, ku, kau, nya 
4. lah, kah 
There is no co-occurrence of suffixes in 
each 'layer' except for 'i' and 'kan'. As an 
example, from the word baharu 'new', we have, 
on affixation, 
di + baharu + i + kan + nya + kah 
d~baha~ka_n_n~akah'is it renewed 
(by subject)?' 
--580 
Infixes 
There are three infixes in B.M. - '-el-', 
'-em-' and '-er-'. For example, 
getar + el ~ se~a~ 'to tremble' 
gilang + em ~ sem~$ 'to be very 
splendid' 
gigis + er ~ $~!~!~ 'to be very uneven' 
These three infixes are not productive 
and only account for a small number of word- 
forms only. 
Circumfixes 
Circumfixes are discontinuous combinat- 
ions of prefixes and suffixes. The most 
common circumfix is 'ke an'. Example, by 
circumfixation of the w~rd ban~ak_ 'many', we 
have 
ke + banyak + an ~ ~ Z ~  'majority' 
Syntactical and Semantical Features 
Affixation also plays an important role 
in the setting of the syntactical as well as 
semantical features of a wordform. It can 
cause a change in the grammatical class of the 
wordform or even to change the meaning of the 
wordform. For example, 
latih 'to train' + an ~ latihan 'training' 
(syntactical change) 
pe_N + dapat 'to obtain' ~ ~ 2 ~  
'opinion' (semantical change) 
In B.M., the nominal affixes are those 
which cause the wordform it is attached to, to 
take on the grar~natical category of nominals. 
These affixes include 
~:~, ~,  ~,  ~,  _ma~, ~,  ~,  ~,  
ke-an 
Verbal affixes are those which result in a 
verbal category, example, 
~,  ~e, e~, ~:~,  ~,  k~,  fi~, ~ ,  
~e ,  i ,  ~:~ 
Affixes also provide semantical features 
to the wordforms they are attached to. For 
example, the semantical features that can be 
set to the wordforms to which the prefix 'ber' 
is attached are 
reflexive, possessive, or productive. 
Which particular feature should be 
assigned depends on the wordform itself. 
example, 
For 
ber + cukor ' to shave' ~ bercukor 
'to shave oneself' (reflexive) 
ber + kereta 'car' ~ berkereta 
'to possess a car' (possessive) 
ber + anak 'child' ~ beranak 
'to give birth' (productive) 
Multiple Affixation 
Multiple affixation also occurs in B.M. 
Fortunately, not more than three layers of 
affixation can occur, e.g., 
ber + ke + se + orang 'person' + an 
~E~?1~$~ 'to suffer 
loneliness' 
Multiple affixation results in added 
complexities in the setting of semantical 
features. The syntactical category of the 
affixed wordform is the category set by the 
outermost prefix. But due to combinations of 
affixes, the semantical features may increase 
and sometimes even differ. For example, 
pe-N + da~ 'to obtain' ~ pendapat 
'opinion' 
ber + ~nda~a~ ~ ~ ! ~  
'possess opinion' 
The Morphological Model for B.M. 
The model described here covers the three 
morphological processes described in the above 
section though not all are included. Those 
excluded are: 
i. partial reduplication - this only 
occurs in colloquial B.M. and not in 
standard B.M. 
2. infixes - the small number of 
occurrences do not justify its hand- 
ling under ATEF. They are merely 
regarded as rootforms and set up as 
dictionary entries in this model. 
Reduplication and compounding are suite 
straightforward and do not present much of a 
problem in the morphological analysis of B.M. 
In this model, reduplicated words are treated 
as 'compound words', that is, a single node 
(ULMCP) is created with the duplicates as 
brother nodes. For example, the compound word 
kanaklkanak results in the following sub-tree: 
--581-- 
ULOCC 
; 
! 
ULMCP 
; 
I 
! 
i ! 
i i 
Compound words are treated as idiomatic 
expressions and a single node is created for 
them. For example, the word b!~a h~E!f results 
in the following sub-tree: 
ULOCC 
i 
t 
! 
BUTAttURUF 
As affixation is the most complex of the 
three processes, a Finite State Diagram is 
used to show the various stages in the de-seg- 
mentation of a given word-form: 
base r I / - -  +(3) l 
I ! 
I prefix I I I r---- - -7  I 
i \ ~ I I c - - 7  
/ 
i ~ / , I  \ ? 
f_ x + ll) _ b_a t <2> . . . .  <4)-- + 
I t i 
I i l 
l V i 
~ (5,). - , -  - -' 
I , i 
I ? , I 
L- ----- -->(6) ~- J  --- -J 
Beginning with state O, on encountering 
a prefix, the analysis proceeds to state i. 
If a base is encountered, state 2 is reached. 
In state i, on encountering another prefix, it 
still remains in state I. This is due to the 
possibility of having multiple affixation in 
B.M. State i goes to state 2 when a base is 
encountered. From state 2, whichever state is 
reached depends on which suffixes are 
encountered: 
state 3 - an, wan, wati, man, is, isma 
state 4 - i, kan 
state 5 - mu, ku, kau, nya 
state 6 - lah, kah 
This is due to the possible 'layering' 
in suffixation (as described above). States 
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all final states in this 
State Diagram. 
In each state, information is added to the 
extracted rootform as the analysis proceeds, 
e.g. syntactical and semantical features set 
by affixation, reduplication, etc. (as 
described in the above section.) The set of 
semantical features used in this model can be 
obtained from the Appendix. In this model, no 
decision is made as to which of the possible 
semantical features should be added when the 
affix/affixes are deleted from the wordform. 
Instead, the whole set of possible features 
are added. At the time of writing, further 
research is being carried out concerning the 
extraction of the correct semantical feature 
and not include the whole set. 
A sample of B.M. morphological analysis 
of a text using this model is included in the 
Appendix. 
Limitations of ATEF 
While testing the model under ATEF, it 
was found that ATEF could not handle two 
aspects of B.M.: 
i. Affixation of Proper Nouns 
In B.M., it is possible to attach the 
particles kah and !~ to proper nouns, example, 
Ahmad 'name of person' + lah ~ Ahmadlah 
'Ahmad prt.' 
Penang 'name of state' + kah ~ Penangkah 
'Penang prt. ' 
2. Affixation of Idiomatic Expressions 
Idiomatic expressions in B.M. can also be 
subjected to affixation, example, 
ber + buta huruf 'illiterate' ~ berbuta 
h \ ]~\ ] f -T~-be illiterate' 
These two problems have been communicated 
to the GETA group who are looking into these 
problems. 
Conclusion 
This paper has attempted to provide a 
possible model for the morphological analysis 
of B.M. under ATEF but is not the complete 
model as yet. More research work is being done 
to refine this model with the ultimate 
objective of providing as much information as 
possible in the morphological analysis stage 
to be passed to the next stage in ARIANE-78, 
that is, the multi-level analysis stage under 
ROBRA. One aspect which is being looked into 
is the possibility of 'layering' prefixes just 
as has been done for suffixes. Another area of 
research is the possibility of extracting the 
- -582 
exact semantical feature set by affixation of 
the word-form, instead of including the whole 
set of possible semantical features. This 
would remove much ambiguity and would also 
simplify the analysis in the next stage.
