! don ' t  th ink  that  natura l  language 
in ter f faces  are  a very  good idea .  By  that  \[ 
mean convent iona l  natura l  language 
in ter faces  - -  the  k ind  where  the  user" types  
in  a quest ion  and  the  sys tem t r ies  to  
unders tand  i t .  Oh sure ,  when ( i f ? )  
computers  have  wor ld  knowledge th, '~t  i s  
comparab le  to  what  humans  need to  
communicate  w i th  eactr  o ther ,  natura l  
language in ter faces  w i l l  be  easy  to  bu i ld  
and ,  depend ing  on what  e l se  is ava i lab le ,  
might  be a good way  to  communicate  w i th  
computers .  But  today  we are  soooooo  fa t  
away f rom hav ing  that  much knowledge in  a 
sys tem,  convent iona l  natura l  l anguage 
in ter faces  don ' t  make sense .  
There  i s  someth ing  d i f fe rent  that  makes  
more  sense  ---- NLMenu.  I t  i s  a combinat ion  
o f  menu techno logy  w i th  natura l  language 
unders tand ing  techno logy ,  and  i t  e \ ] iminates  
many o f  the  de f i c ienc ies  one  f inds  w i th  
convent iona l  natura l  language in ter faces  
wh i le  re ta in ing  the  impor tant  benef i t s .  
~ ince  a eonvewL iona l  natura l  language 
in ter face  inv i tes  the  user" to  type  in  
whatever  he wants ,  i t  i s  based  on the  
assumpt ion  that  i t  w i l l  be ab le  to  
unders tand  jus t  about  anyth ing  that  the  
users  a re  l i ke ly  to  say .  A l l  sys tems today  
dea l  w i th  l im i ted  domains  of:  d i scourse .  I 
am conv inced  that  users  a re  l i ke ly  to  type  
in  a l \ ]  k inds  o f  th ings .  The probab i l i ty  i s  
h igh  that  users  w i l l  not  be unders tood .  
They  eou\ ]d  be taught  the  l im i ta t ions  o f  
l ingu is t i c  and  concepLu~\ ]  coverage  o f  the  
sys tem,  but:  a ma jor  mot ivat ion  o f  bu i ld ing  
na J tura l  language in ter faces  i s  t:o a l low 
e f fec t ive  use  w i thout  t~ 'a in ing  or  
re t ra in ing .  So ,  i t  doesn ' t  seem l i ke  a 
very  good idea .  
The assumpt ion  beh ind  NLMenu i s  the  
oppos i te .  I t  assumes  that  there  are  a l i  
k inds  o f  th~ngs  that  the  users  wou ld  l i ke  
to  ask  but  that  the  coverage  i s  so l im i ted  
that  i?  i s  best  to  revea l  the  coverage  
( l im i ta t ions)  to  the  user ' .  He then  (:an 
f ind  qu ick ly  that  what  he wanted  ?o ask  
cannot  be asked  o f  th i s  sys tem,  so he ' l l  
give up quick ly ,  min imiz ing  h is  
f rus t ra t ion .  Or he might  f ind that what  he 
wanted  to ask can be asked and the sys tem 
he lps  h im ,ask i t  in  the  way  i t  w i l l  
unders tand .  There  i s  another  impor tar rL  
advantage:  there  may be  th ings  that  the  
user  d id  not  imag ine  that  he cou ld  ask  
about .  NLMenu revea\ ]s  these  to  the  user  
encourag ing  him to make full use of sysLem 
capab i l i t i es ,  Convent iona l  natural  
l anguage sys tems do  not .  
NLNenu works  by  d i sp lay ing  a co l lec t ion  o f  
menus o f  words  and  phrases  on  the  sc reen .  
The user  bu i lds  sentences  by  se lec t ing  
words  and  phrases  f rom the  menus .  \]-he 
menus are  dr iven  by  a para l le l  parser  wh ich  
mainta ins  a l l  parses  of the  sentence  
f ragment  const ructed  so  fa r .  AFter  each  
word  or  phrase  i s  se lec ted ,  the  parser  
looks  ahead in  the  grammar  fo r  a l l  the  
phrases  that  cou ld  come next  fo r  each  
parse .  A new set  o f  menus  i s  const ructed  
w i th  these  phrases ,  wh ich  are  then  
d isp layed  ?o  the  user  fo r  h i s  next  
se lec t ion .  In  th i s  way,  the  NLHenu sys tem 
i s  const ra in ing  the  user  to  const ruct ing  
on ly  those  , '{ententes  that  a re  parsab ie  w i th  
the  grammar .  By inc lud ing  semant ic  
const ra in ts ,  one  can  a l so  const ra in  the  
user  to  the  conceptua l  coverage  o?  the  
sys tem.  In  our" cur rent  imp lementat ions ,  we 
use  semant ic  g rammars  so syntact i c  and  
semant ic  const ra in ts  a re  conveyed s imply .  
Many other  techn iques  can  be imag ined .  
Because  the  NLMenu techn ique  res ts  on the  
same techno log ies  as  convent iona l  natura l  
language in ter faces ,  they  have  'Lhe same 
express ive  power  ---  one  can  say  the  same 
range o f  th ings  w i th  e i ther  approach .  But  
s ince  NLMenu i s  a sys tem- in i t ia ted  d ia log ,  
the  sys tem a lways  knows what  the  user  i s  
t ry ing  to  express .  Th is  makes  i t  very  easy  
to  mix  natura l  lanquage (sentence  bu i ld ing)  
w i th  o ther -  in ter face  techn iques  such  as  
graph ica l  input ,  fo r rn  f i \ ]  l i ng  and  o thers .  
For" example ,  in  an  app l i ca t ion  invo lv ing  
a i rpor ts ,  when the  user  was about  to  enter  
the  locat ion ,  a map popped up ,  the  user  
po in ted  a t  the  area  of  in teres t ,  then  the  
map went  away and the  coord inates  o f  that  
\ ]oeat ion  were  textua l ly  inser ted  in to  the  
sentence .  The  user  then  cont inued bu i ld ing  
the  sentence .  Th is  a l lowed the  use  o f  text  
where  appropr ia te  ( spec i fy ing  runway 
lengths ,  locat ion  names ,  e~c . )  and  graph ics  
where appropr ia te  ( spec i fy ing  locat ions) .  
I t  .seems ?o  me that  there  i s  much more  that  
user  in ter faces  ~-an ga in  f rom natura l  
language research .  For  exe Jmple ,  
cooperat ive  response  i s  a good idea  
independent  o f  whether  an  or ig ina l  query  
was expressed  in  Eng l i sh  or  a fo rmal  query  
language or  th rough some other  means .  
S imi la r ly ,  repeated  re ference  i s  impor tant  
in  any  extended d ia log .  D iscourse  ob jec ts  
shou ld  remain  ava i lab le  fo r  te rse  
re ference .  There  i s  noth ing  that  l im i ts  
repeated  re ference  to  natura \ ]  language 
d ia \ ]ogs .  Ideas  based  on  focus  and  d ia log  
s~ruct :ure  can  be app\ ] ied  to  d ia \ ]ogs  
med iated  throu! \ ]h  a l l  sor ts  o f  in ter face  
languages .  We seem to  be  concent ra t ing  on  
reproduc ing  the  fo rm o f  human communicat ion  
and  ignor ing  the  substance:  la rge  
vocabu lar ies ,  concept  c reat ion  through 
re ference ,  mod i f i ca J t ion  and  ana logy ,  
mechan isms I :hat  use  context  to  ga in  
te rseness  and a l lowing  d ia \ ]ogs  to  
accomodate  the  non l i r~ear  character i s t i cs  o f  
human thought .  Natura l  \ ]anguage researc \ ]h  
has  much more  Lo o f fe r "  the  wor ld  than  
s imply  a means  fo r  in terpret ing  typewr i t ten  
commands ,  yet  we as  a f ie ld  have  
accompl i shed  l i t t le  toward  in f luenc ing  the  
o ther  user  in ter face  techno log ies .
