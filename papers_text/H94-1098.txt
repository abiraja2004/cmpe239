PROJECT GOALS 
TIPSTER/SHOGUN, part of the ARPA TIPSTER Text (Phase 
I) program, was led by GE Corporate Research and Develop- 
ment, with Carnegie Mellon University and Martin Marietta 
Management and Data Systems (formerly GE Aerospace). 
The project ended at the beginning of 1994, with TIP- 
STER Phase II expected to begin in March. The TIP- 
STER/SHOGUN system is thus the end result of a two-year 
research effort. The project's main goals were: (1) to develop 
algorithms that would advance the state of the art in coverage 
and accuracy in data extraction, and (2) to demonstrate high 
performance and adaptability across languages and domains. 
The team concentrated itsresearch on the development of a 
model of finite-state approximation, within which the perfor- 
mance of more detailed models of language could be realized 
in a simple, efficient framework, and on automated knowl- 
edge acquisition. The ability of programs to extract data from 
free text is, in general, imited by the coverage of domain and 
world knowledge. We chose to focus on knowledge acquisi- 
tion from corpus data, thereby expanding the coverage of the 
system while also helping to tune each configuration. 
Like other TIPSTER contractors, the TIPSTER/SHOGUN 
team ran its system on a series of benchmarks, ending with 
the MUC-5 evaluation in August, 1993. MUC-5 included 
tests in four configurations, comprised of two domains (joint 
ventures and micro-electronics) in each of two languages (En- 
glish and Japanese). Although many of the research results of 
SHOGUN had little or no impact on the benchmarks, MUC-5 
provided acomprehensive test of system performance. 
RECENT RESULTS 
The finite-state approximation method eveloped under TIP- 
STER was inspired by earlier work at GE and SRI, along with 
experiments near the mid-point of our project, which showed 
that tighter control, particularly in parsing, contributed very 
little to text interpretation while greatly inhibiting knowledge 
acquisition. This shift was also influenced by the demands of 
Japanese language processing, where our existing knowledge 
resources were less refined than in English. 
The relationship between representation, i.e., the finite-state 
patterns in our system, and acquisition, i.e., the method by 
which new knowledge is added, is critical. In our system, 
we chose to emphasize the finite-state patterns in part because 
they help to take advantage of the most critical source of 
knowledge we have available--the corpus. 
The corpus-based acquisition strategy used statistical methods 
to help identify key phrases and other lexical relations in the 
corpus, and to assign these lexical relations to word groups 
with similar interpretations. This approach worked best for 
task components hat required large amounts of knowledge, 
particularly determining the product or service of each joint 
venture. We believe this accounts for some of the large dif- 
ferences in coverage between SHOGUN and other systems. 
In addition to helping coverage, the corpus-based acquisition 
strategy greatly eased portability across languages. In most 
cases, we did each English component first, then used the 
English as a way of bootstrapping the Japanese. For example, 
we would take each important "pivot" word in English, try to 
identify the corresponding "pivot" in Japanese, then use the 
corpus to identify the relevant contexts in which that word 
occurred in Japanese. SHOGUN's accuracy in Japanese was 
somewhat higher, on average, than in English. 
SHOGUN, on average, extracted 37% more information cor- 
rectly (37% higher ecall) than any other system in each of 
the four MUC-5 configurations. On average, SHOGUN's 
precision was 13% lower than the next best system. Recall 
advanced 37% on average between the TIPSTER 18-month 
evaluation and the MUC-5 test 6 months later, and was 10% 
higher in the TIPSTER final test han in MUC-4 (which was a 
much simpler task). We are particularly satisfied by the con- 
sistently improving coverage of our system across languages 
and domains. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
As TIPSTER Phase II begins this year, the emphasis will be 
on developing an architecture that incorporates some of our 
Phase I results into an open framework that promotes delivery 
as well as further technical advances, In addition, our research 
will continue to integrate methods from information retrieval 
(detection) with more detailed language processing strategies.
