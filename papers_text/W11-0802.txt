Abstract
Taking as a starting-point the development
on cooccurrence techniques for several lan-
guages, we focus on the aspects that should
be considered in a NV extraction task for
Basque. In Basque, NV expressions are con-
sidered those combinations in which a noun,
inflected or not, is co-occurring with a verb, as
erabakia hartu (?to make a decision?), kontuan
hartu (?to take into account?) and buruz jakin
(?to know by heart?). A basic extraction sys-
tem has been developed and evaluated against
two references: a) a reference which includes
NV entries from several lexicographic works;
and b) a manual evaluation by three experts of
a random sample from the n-best lists.
1 Introduction
The last decade has witnessed great advances in the
automatic identification and processing of MWEs.
In the case of Basque, advances are limited to termi-
nology extraction and the tagging in corpora of the
MWEs represented in lexical databases.
Furthermore, the work on both theoretical and
practical phraseology in Basque has been mainly fo-
cused on idiomatic expressions, leaving aside col-
locations (Pe?rez Gaztelu et al, 2004). As a con-
sequence, Basque NLP and lexicography have not
benefited from the approach that emphasized the im-
portance of such units, and very important areas are
underdeveloped.
With the aim of taking steps to turn this situa-
tion, we undertake the task of extracting NV com-
binations from corpora. As a preliminary step, we
must face the morphosyntactic aspects of Basque
that might influence the efficiency of the process.
2 MWE: basic definition and extraction
techniques
As a basis for our work, we take idiomaticity as
the key feature for the definition and classifica-
tion of MWE. Idiomaticity could be described as a
non-discrete magnitude, whose ?value?, according
to recent investigations (Baldwin and Kim, 2010;
Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Granger and Paquot,
2008), has turned to depend on a complex combi-
nation of features such as institutionalization, non-
compositionality and lexico-syntactic fixedness.
The idiomaticity of MWEs appears rather as a
continuum than as a scale of discrete values (Sin-
clair, 1996; Wulff, 2010). Thus, the classifica-
tion of MWEs into discrete categories is a difficult
task. Taking Cowie?s classification as an initial basis
(Cowie, 1998), our work is focused on phrase-like
units, aiming, at this stage, to differentiate MWEs
(idioms and collocations) from free combinations.
Specifically, NV combinations with the following
characteristics are considered as MWEs:
? Idioms: non-compositional combinations, as
opaque idioms (adarra jo: ?to pull somebody?s
leg?; lit: ?to play the horn?) and figurative id-
ioms (burua hautsi: ?to rack one?s brain?; lit:
?to break one?s head?).
? Collocations:
? Semicompositional combinations, in
which the noun keeps its literal meaning,
2
whereas the verb acts as a support verb
(lan egin: ?to work?; lit. ?to do work?),
or has a meaning which is specific to that
combination (atentzioa eman: ?to catch
someone?s eye?; lit. ?to give attention?
(sth to sb)); legea urratu: ?to break the
law?; lit. ?to tear the law?).
? Compositional combinations with lexical
restriction, in which it is not possible to
substitute the verb with its synonyms, or
that present a clear statistical idiosyncrasy
in favor of a given synonym choice (elka-
rtasuna adierazi: ?to express solidarity?;
konpromisoa berretsi: ?to confirm a com-
mitment?).
Among the different techniques that have been
proposed to extract and characterize MWEs, the
cooccurrence of the components is the most used
heuristic of institutionalization, and the use of asso-
ciation measures (AM) goes back to early research
on this field (Church and Hanks, 1990; Smadja,
1993). In recent years, the comparative analysis of
AMs has aroused considerable interest, as well as
the possibility of obtaining better results by com-
bining them (Pearce, 2002; Pecina, 2005). Cooc-
currence techniques are usually used in combination
with linguistic techniques, which allow the use of
lemmatized and POS-tagged corpora, or even syn-
tactic dependencies (Seretan, 2008).
3 Special features of Basque NV
combinations
These are some characteristics of the NV combina-
tions in Basque to be considered in order to design
the extraction process efficiently:
? Basque being an agglutinative language, MWE
extraction must work on tagged texts, in order
to identify different surface forms with their
corresponding lemma. Thus, pure statistical
methods working with raw text are not ex-
pected to yield acceptable results.
? Some combinations with a noun as first lemma
do not correspond to NV combinations in the
sense that is usually understood in English. For
example, the expression kontuan hartu can be
translated as take into account, where kontu is
a noun in the inessive case. We are interested in
all types of combinations that a noun can form
with verbs.
? Representing NV combinations as lemma-
lemma pairs is by no means satisfactory; we
would not be able to differentiate the aforemen-
tioned kontuan hartu from kontu hartu (?to ask
for an explanation?). So it is necessary to deal
with the form or type of every noun.
? In order to propose canonical forms for NV
combinations, we need case and number an-
notations for nouns in bigram data. The next
examples are different forms of the canoni-
cal erabakia hartu (?to make a decision?): ez
zuen erabakirik hartu (?he did not make any
decision?), zenbait erabaki hartu behar ditugu
(?we have to make some decisions?). Canonical
forms can be formulated by bigram normaliza-
tion (see section 4.5 for details).
4 Experimental setup
4.1 Corpora resources
In our experiments, we use a journalistic cor-
pus from two sources: (1) Issues published be-
tween 2001-2002 by the newspaper Euskaldunon
Egunkaria (28 Mw); and (2) Issues published be-
tween 2006-2010 by the newspaper Berria (47 Mw).
So, the overall size of the corpus is 75 Mw.
4.2 Corpus-processing
For linguistic tagging, we use EUSTAGGER by the
IXA group of the University of the Basque Country
(Aduriz et al, 1996). After linguistic processing, we
obtain information about the lemma, part-of-speech,
subcategory, case, number and other morphosyntac-
tic features.
We used EUSTAGGER without the module to de-
tect and annotate MWEs in order to evaluate the au-
tomatic extraction, regardless of wheter the candi-
dates are in the lexical database.
4.3 Preparing tagged corpora for bigram
generation
For bigram generation, we use the Ngram Statistics
Package-NSP (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2010). In
3
order to retain in the text sent to NSP the linguis-
tic information needed according to section 3, we
add different types of linguistic information to the
tokens, depending on the POS of the components of
the combination we are dealing with. In the case of
NV combinations, the nouns are represented in the
following form:
token lemma POS subcategory case number
In the case of verbs, only lemma and POS are
used, as verb inflection has no influence on the
canonical form of the expression. In future work,
verb inflection will be one of the parameters to mea-
sure syntactical flexibility. All other types of tokens
are discarded and considered as ?non-token? for NSP
processing.
Before this step, some surface-grammar rules are
defined to detect and filter the participle forms that
are not part of a NV combination, but must be ana-
lyzed as adjectives or nouns (eg. herrialde aurrerat-
uak ?developed countries?, and gobernuaren aliat-
uak, ?government?s allies?).
4.4 Bigram generation
We generated bigram sets for two different window
spans: ?1 and ?5. In both sets, the frequency cri-
terion for a bigram to be generated is f > 30. Also,
the following punctuation marks are interpreted as
a boundary for bigram generation: period, colon,
semicolon, and question and exclamation marks.
Then, all counts of bigrams in NV and VN order are
combined using NSP, and reordered in NV order.
Additionally, a heuristic is used to filter some
combinations. The first member of many ?com-
pound verbs? like nahi izan (?to want?), is a noun,
and some of them combine usually with a verb, in
VN order: ikusi nahi (zuen) (?he wanted to see?). In
order to reduce this noise, the combinations occur-
ring mostly in VN order are removed. The combi-
nations generated from passive constructions (hartu-
tako erabakien ondorioak, ?the consequences of the
decisions made?) are not affected by this filtering.
4.5 Bigram normalization
In order to get more representative statistics, and
to get information that would enable us to propose
a canonical form for each MWE candidate, differ-
ent inflection forms of the same case in nouns are
normalized to the most frequent form, and bigram
counts are recalculated. I.e. [ erabakia / erabakiak
/ erabakiok / erabakirik / erabaki ] hartu are col-
lapsed to erabakia hartu (?to make a decision?), be-
cause all the mentioned forms of the lemma erabaki
appear in the absolutive case. In contrast, the com-
binations kontu hartu (?to ask for an explanation?)
and kontuan hartu (?take into account?) are not nor-
malized, as their noun forms correspond to differ-
ent cases, namely, absolutive (kontu) and inessive
(kontuan). A Perl script detects in the dataset the
bigrams to be normalized, using the combined key
noun lemma/noun case+verb lemma, creates a sin-
gle bigram with the most frequent form, and sums
the frequencies of bigrams and those of the noun un-
igrams.
As an example, this is normalization data for
kalean ibili (?to walk on the street?):
kalean kale IZE ARR INE NUMS<>ibili ADI<>223 3354 10880
kaleetan kale IZE ARR INE NUMP<>ibili ADI<>119 243 10880
?
kalean kale IZE ARR INE NUMS<>ibili ADI<>342 3597 10880
Besides, ergative-singular ? absolutive-plural
normalization is carried out when the ratio is greater
than 1:5. This heuristic is used in order to repair
some mistakes from the tagger. Finally, partitive
case (PAR) is assimilated to absolutive (ABS) for bi-
gram normalization; partitive is a case used in neg-
ative, interrogative and conditional sentences with
subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transi-
tive verbs. I.e. ez zuen erabakirik hartu (?he did not
make any decision?).
Thus, this is the normalization of erabakia hartu:
erabakia erabaki IZE ARR ABS NUMS<>hartu ADI<>2658 6329 88447
erabakiak erabaki IZE ARR ABS NUMP<>hartu ADI<>1632 2397 88447
erabakiak erabaki IZE ARR ERG NUMP<>hartu ADI<>88 141 88447
erabakirik erabaki IZE ARR PAR MG<>hartu ADI<>211 211 88447
?
erabakia erabaki IZE ARR ABS NUMS<>hartu ADI<>4589 9361 88447
4.6 AM calculation
The statistical analysis of cooccurrence data is car-
ried out using Stefan Evert?s UCS toolkit (Evert,
2005). The most common association measures are
calculated for each bigram: f , t-score (also t-test),
log-likelihood ratio, MI, MI3, and chi-square (?2).
4.7 Evaluation
In order to evaluate the results of the bigram extrac-
tion process, we use as a reference a collection of
4
NV expressions published in five Basque resources:
a) The Unified Basque Dictionary, b) Euskal Hizte-
gia (Sarasola, 1996); c) Elhuyar Hiztegia; d) Intza
project; and e) EDBL (Aldezabal et al, 2001).
The total number for NV expressions is 3,742.
Despite the small size of the reference, we believe
that it may be valid for a comparison of the perfor-
mance of different AMs. Nevertheless, even a su-
perficial analysis reveals that the reference is mostly
made up of two kinds of combinations, idioms and
typical ?compound verbs?1.
Every evaluation against a dictionary depends
largely on its recall and quality, and we envisage,
as recommended by Krenn (1999), to build a hand-
made gold standard. To this end, we extract an eval-
uation sample merging the 2,000-best candidates of
each AM ranking from the w = ?1 extraction set.
There are 4,334 different bigrams in this set. This
manual evaluation is an ongoing work by a group of
three experts (one of them is an author of this paper).
Annotators were provided with an evaluation man-
ual, with explanatory information about the evalua-
tion task and the guidelines that must be followed to
differentiate MWEs from free combinations, based
on the criteria mentioned in section 2. Illustrative
examples are included.
At present, a random sample of 600 has been eval-
uated (13.8%), with a Fleiss kappa of 0.46. Even
though some authors have reported lower agree-
ments on this task (Street et al, 2010), this level of
agreement is comparatively low (Fazly and Steven-
son, 2007; Krenn et al, 2004), and by no means sat-
isfactory. It is necessary to make further efforts to
improve the discriminatory criteria, and achieve a
better ?tuning? between the annotators.
5 Results
Figure 1 shows the precision curves obtained for
each AM in the automatic evaluation. Frequency
yields the best precision, followed by t-score, log-
likelihood and MI3. MI and ?2 have a very low
performance, even below the baseline2. These re-
1Support verbs with syntactic idiosyncrasy (anomalous use
of the indefinite noun), as lan egin (?to work?) and min hartu
(?to get hurt?).
2Following Evert (2005), our baseline corresponds to the
precision yielded by a random ranking of the n candidates from
thedata set?; and our topline is ?the precision achieved by an
sults are consistent with those reported by Krenn and
Evert (2001) for support-verbs (FVG). Accordingly,
this is the type of combination which is very much
present in our dictionary reference.
Figure 1: Precision results for the extraction set with w =
?1 and f > 30.
Figure 2 offers an evaluation of the influence of
window span and bigram normalization. The best
results are obtained by the f ranking with a narrow
window and without bigram normalization. Regard-
ing bigram normalization, it could be concluded, at
first sight, that the canonical forms included in the
dictionary are not the most frequent forms of their
corresponding MWEs. Thus, the frequency criteria
used to normalize different forms of the same case
and assign canonical forms must be reviewed. As for
window span, the hypothesis that, since Basque is
largely a free-word-order language, a wider window
would yield more significant cooccurrence statistics,
is not confirmed at the moment. Further analysis is
needed to interpret these results from a deeper lin-
guistic point of view.
Even though the manually evaluated random sam-
ple is small (600 combinations), some provisional
conclusions can be drawn from the results. The
amount of candidates validated by at least two of the
three evaluators is 153, whereas only 29 of them are
included in the dictionary reference. Even though
MWE classification has not yet been undertaken by
the annotator?s team, a first analysis by the authors
shows that most of the manually validated combina-
?ideal? measure that ranks all TPs at the top of the list?.

ferent extraction sets (f > 30): a) w = ?1 with bigram

tions not included in the dictionary (108 out of 124)
are restricted collocations (mainly support-verb con-
structions that are not ?compound verbs?) or statis-
tically idiosyncratic units. This is the first clue that
confirms our suspicions about the limited coverage
and representativeness of the reference. At the same
time, it could be one of the possible explanations for
the low inter-annotator agreement achieved, as far as
those types of MWEs are the most difficult to differ-
entiate from free combinations.
Figure 3 presents the precision curves for the
complete evaluation set estimated from the manu-
ally evaluated random sample using the technique
proposed by Evert and Krenn (2005). As expected,
precision results increase compared with the evalu-
ation against the dictionary. Frequency and t-score
outperform the other AMs, but frequency is not the
best measure in the whole range, as it is overtaken
by t-score in the first 1,200 candidates.
6 Conclusions and Future work
The first results for the extraction of NV expressions
in Basque are similar to the figures in Krenn and
Evert (2001). Frequency and t-score are good mea-
sures and it seems difficult to improve upon them.
Nevertheless, in light of the results, it is essential to
complete the manual evaluation and build a repre-
sentative gold standard in order to have a more pre-
cise idea of the coverage of the reference, and get

don sample manually evaluated (600 conbinations).
a more accurate view of the behaviour of AMs in
function of several factors such as the type of combi-
nation, corpus size, frequency range, window span,
etc. Bigram normalization is, in principle, a reason-
able procedure to formulate representative canoni-
cal forms, but requires a deeper analysis of the si-
lence that it seems to generate in the results. Finally,
the first evaluation using a small gold-standard is en-
couraging, because it suggests that using AMs it is
possible to find new expressions that are not pub-
lished in Basque dictionaries.
In the near future, we want to carry out a more
comprehensive evaluation of the AMs, and study
how to combine them in order to improve the re-
sults (Pecina and Schlesinger, 2006). In addition of
this, we want to detect lexical, syntactic and seman-
tic features of the expressions, and use this informa-
tion to characterize them (Fazly et al, 2009).
