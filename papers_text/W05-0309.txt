Abstract
The Proposition Bank (PropBank) project
is aimed at creating a corpus of text an-
notated with information about seman-
tic propositions. The second phase of
the project, PropBank II adds additional
levels of semantic annotation which in-
clude eventuality variables, co-reference,
coarse-grained sense tags, and discourse
connectives. This paper presents the re-
sults of the parallel PropBank II project,
which adds these richer layers of semantic
annotation to the first 100K of the Chinese
Treebank and its English translation. Our
preliminary analysis supports the hypoth-
esis that this additional annotation recon-
ciles many of the surface differences be-
tween the two languages.
1 Introduction
There is a pressing need for a consensus on a task-
oriented level of semantic representation that can en-
able the development of powerful new semantic ana-
lyzers in the same way that the Penn Treebank (Mar-
cus et al, 1993) enabled the development of sta-
tistical syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak,
2001). We believe that shallow semantics expressed
as a dependency structure, i.e., predicate-argument
structure, for verbs, participial modifiers, and nom-
inalizations provides a feasible level of annotation
that would be of great benefit. This annotation, cou-
pled with word senses, minimal co-reference links,

event identifiers, and discourse and temporal rela-
tions, could provide the foundation for a major ad-
vance in our ability to automatically extract salient
relationships from text. This will in turn facilitate
breakthroughs in message understanding, machine
translation, fact retrieval, and information retrieval.
The Proposition Bank project is a major step towards
providing this type of annotation. It takes a prac-
tical approach to semantic representation, adding a
layer of predicate argument information, or seman-
tic roles, to the syntactic structures of the Penn Tree-
bank (Palmer et al, 2005). The Frame Files that
provide guidance to the annotators constitute a rich
English lexicon with explicit ties between syntac-
tic realizations and coarse-grained senses, Frame-
sets. PropBank Framesets are distinguished primar-
ily by syntactic criteria such as differences in sub-
categorization frames, and can be seen as the top-
level of an hierarchy of sense distinctions. Group-
ings of fine-grained WordNet senses, such as those
developed for Senseval2 (Palmer et al, to appear)
provide an intermediate level, where groups are dis-
tinguished by either syntactic or semantic criteria.
WordNet senses constitute the bottom level. The
PropBank Frameset distinctions, which can be made
consistently by humans and systems (over 90% ac-
curacy for both), are surprisingly compatible with
the groupings; 95% of the groups map directly onto
a single PropBank frameset sense (Palmer et al,
2004).
The semantic annotation provided by PropBank
is only a first approximation at capturing the full
richness of semantic representation. Additional an-
notation of nominalizations and other noun pred-
61
icates has already begun at NYU. This paper de-
scribes the results of PropBank II, a project to pro-
vide richer semantic annotation to structures that
have already been propbanked, specifically, eventu-
ality ID.s, coreference, coarse-grained sense tags,
and discourse connectives. Of special interest to the
machine translation community is our finding, pre-
sented in this paper, that PropBank II annotation rec-
onciles many of the surface differences of the two
languages.
2 PropBank I
PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) is an annotation of
the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank
II (Marcus et al, 1994) with ?predicate-argument?
structures, using sense tags for highly polysemous
words and semantic role labels for each argument.
An important goal is to provide consistent seman-
tic role labels across different syntactic realizations
of the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0 John]
broke [ARG1 the window] and [ARG1 The window]
broke. PropBank can provide frequency counts for
(statistical) analysis or generation components in
a machine translation system, but provides only a
shallow semantic analysis in that the annotation is
close to the syntactic structure and each verb is its
own predicate.
In PropBank, semantic roles are defined on a
verb-by-verb basis. An individual verb?s seman-
tic arguments are simply numbered, beginning with
0. Polysemous verbs have several framesets, cor-
responding to a relatively coarse notion of word
senses, with a separate set of numbered roles, a role-
set, defined for each Frameset. For instance, leave
has both a DEPART Frameset ([ARG0 John] left
[ARG1 the room]) and a GIVE Frameset, ([ARG0
I] left [ARG1 my pearls] [ARG2 to my daughter-in-
law] [ARGM-LOC in my will].) While most Frame-
sets have three or four numbered roles, as many
as six can appear, in particular for certain verbs of
motion. Verbs can take any of a set of general,
adjunct-like arguments (ARGMs), such as LOC (lo-
cation), TMP (time), DIS (discourse connectives),
PRP (purpose) or DIR (direction). Negations (NEG)
and modals (MOD) are also marked.
There are several other annotation projects,
FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998), Salsa (Ellsworth et
al., 2004), and the Prague Tectogrammatics (Haji-
cova and Kucerova, 2002), that share similar goals.
Berkeley.s FrameNet project, (Baker et al, 1998;
Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al, 2002)
is committed to producing rich semantic frames on
which the annotation is based, but it is less con-
cerned with annotating complete texts, concentrat-
ing instead on annotating a set of examples for each
predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives),
and attempting to describe the network of relations
among the semantic frames. For instance, the buyer
of a buy event and the seller of a sell event would
both be Arg0.s (Agents) in PropBank, while in
FrameNet one is the BUYER and the other is the
SELLER. The Salsa project (Ellsworth et al, 2004)
in Germany is producing a German lexicon based
on the FrameNet semantic frames and annotating a
large German newswire corpus. PropBank style an-
notation is being used for verbs which do not yet
have FrameNet frames defined.
The PropBank annotation philosophy has been
extended to the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank
(Xue and Palmer, 2003). The Chinese PropBank an-
notation is performed on a smaller (250k words) and
yet growing corpus annotated with syntactic struc-
tures (Xue et al, To appear). The same syntac-
tic alternations that form the basis for the English
PropBank annotation also exist in robust quantities
in Chinese, even though it may not be the case that
the same exact verbs (meaning verbs that are close
translations of one another) have the exact same
range of syntactic realization for Chinese and En-
glish. For example, in (1), ?#c/New Year???/
reception? plays the same role in (a) and (b), which
is the event or activity held, even though it occurs in
different syntactic positions. Assigning the same ar-
gument label, Arg1, to both instances, captures this
regularity. It is worth noting that the predicate /?
1/hold? does not have passive morphology in (1a),
despite what its English translation suggests. Like
the English PropBank, the adjunct-like elements re-
ceive more general labels like TMP or LOC, as also
illustrated in (1). The functional tags for Chinese
and English PropBanks are to a large extent similar
and more details can be found in (Xue and Palmer,
2003).
(1) a. [ARG1 #c/New Year ???/reception] [ARGM-
TMP 8 U/today] [ARGM-LOC 3/at M ~

U,/state guest house] ?1/ hold [arg1 #c/New

?Tang Jiaxuan was holding the New Year reception in
Diaoyutai State Guest House today.?
3 A Parallel PropBank II
As discussed above, PropBank II adds richer se-
mantic annotation to the PropBank I predicate ar-
gument structures, notably eventuality variables,
co-references, coarse-grained sense tags (Babko-
Malaya et al, 2004; Babko-Malaya and Palmer,
2005), and discourse connectives (Xue, To appear)
To create our parallel PropBank II, we began with
the first 100K words of the Chinese Treebank which
had already been propbanked, and which we had
had translated into English. The English transla-
tion was first treebanked and then propbanked, and
we are now in the process of adding the PropBank
II annotation to both the English and the Chinese
propbanks. We will discuss our progress on each of
the three individual components of PropBank II in
turn, bringing out translation issues along the way
that have been highlighted by the additional anno-
tation. In general we find that this level of abstrac-
tion facilitates the alignment of the source and tar-
get language descriptions: event ID.s and event
coreferences simplify the mappings between verbal
and nominal events; English coarse-grained sense
tags correspond to unique Chinese lemmas; and dis-
course connectives correspond well.
3.1 Eventuality variables
Positing eventuality1 variables provides a straight-
forward way to represent the semantics of adver-
bial modifiers of events and capture nominal and
pronominal references to events. Given that the ar-
guments and adjuncts for the verbs are already an-
notated in Propbank I, adding eventuality variables
is for the most part straightforward. The example
in (2) illustrates a Propbank I annotation, which is
identified with a unique event id in Propbank II.
1The term ?eventuality? is used here to refer to events and
states.
(2) a. Mr. Bush met him privately in the White House on
Thursday.
b. Propbank I: Rel: met, Arg0: Mr. Bush, Arg1: him,
ArgM-MNR: privately, ArgM-LOC: in the White
House, ArgM-TMP: on Thursday.
c. Propbank II: ?e meeting(e) & Arg0(e,Mr. Bush) &
Arg1(e, him) & MNR (e, privately) & LOC(e, in the
White House) & TMP (e, on Thursday).
Annotation of event variables starts by auto-
matically associating all Propbank I annotations
with potential event ids. Since not all annotations
actually denote eventualities, we manually filter
out selected classes of verbs. We further attempt
to identify all nouns and nominals which describe
eventualities as well as all sentential arguments of
the verbs which refer to events. And, finally, part
of the PropBank II annotation involves tagging of
event coreference for pronouns as well as empty
categories. All these tasks are discussed in more
detail below.
Identifying event modifiers. The actual annota-
tion starts from the presumption that all verbs are
events or states and nouns are not. All the verbs in
the corpus are automatically assigned a unique event
identifier and the manual part of the task becomes (i)
identification of verbs or verb senses that do not de-
note eventualities, (ii) identification of nouns that do
denote events. For example, in (3), begin is an as-
pectual verb that does not introduce an event vari-
able, but rather modifies the verb -take., as is
supported by the fact that it is translated as an ad-
verb ??/initially? in the corresponding Chinese sen-
tence.

tions, protoelectric integration, etc. have begun to take

Nominalizations as events Although most nouns
do not introduce eventualities, some do and these
nouns are generally nominalizations2 . This is true
2The problem of identifying nouns which denote events is
addressed as part of the sense-tagging tagging. Detailed discus-
sion can be found in (Babko-Malaya and Palmer, 2005).

for both English and Chinese, as is illustrated in (4).
Both /u?/develop0and /\/deepening0are
nominalized verbs that denote events. Having a par-
allel propbank annotated with event variables allows
us to see how events are lined up in the two lan-
guages and how their lexical realizations can vary.
The nominalized verbs in Chinese can be translated
into verbs or their nominalizations, as is shown in
the alternative translations of the Chinese original
in (4). What makes this particular example even
more interesting is the fact that the adjective mod-
ifier of the events, /??/continued0, can ac-
tually be realized as an aspectual verb in English.
The semantic representations of the Propbank II an-
notation, however, are preserved: both the aspec-
tual verb /continue0in English and the adjective
/??/continued0in Chinese are modifiers of the
events denoted by /u?/development0and /
\/deepening0.

/As China.s economy continues to develop and
its practice of opening to the outside continues to
deepen,0
/With the continued development of China.s economy
and the continued deepening of its practice of opening to
the outside,0
Event Coreference Another aspect of the event
variable annotation involves identifying pronominal
expressions that corefer with events. These pronom-
inal expressions may be overt, as in the Chinese ex-
ample in (5), while others correspond to null pro-
nouns, marked as pro3. in the Treebank annotations,
as in (6):

/Among these achievements, 138 items have been ap-
plied to production by enterprises to spin gold from straw,
which greatly improved the production level of China.s

It is not the case, however that overt pro-nouns in
Chinese will always correspond to overt pronouns
in English. In (5), the overt pronoun /?/this0in
Chinese corresponds with a null pronoun in English
in the beginning of a reduced relative clause, while
in (6), the null pronoun in Chinese is translated into
a relative pronoun /which0that introduces a rela-
tive clause. In other cases, neither language has an
overt pronoun, although one is posited in the tree-
bank annotation, as in (7).

Having a parallel propbank annotated with event
variables allows us to examine how the same events
are lexicalized in English and Chi-nese and how they
align, whether they have been indicated by verbs or
nouns.
3.2 Grouped sense tags
In general, the verbs in the Chinese PropBank are
less polysemous than the English PropBank verbs,
with the vast majority of the lemmas having just one
Frameset. On the other hand, the Chinese PropBank
has more lemmas (including stative verbs which are
generally translated into adjectives in English) nor-
malized by the corpus size. The Chinese PropBank
has 4854 lemmas in the 250K words that have been
propbanked alone, while the English PropBank has
just 3635 lemmas in the entire 1 million words cor-
pus. Of the 4854 Chinese lemmas, only 62 of them
have 3 or more framesets. In contrast, 294 lemmas
have 3 or more framesets in the English Propbank.

Table 1: English verbs and their translations in the parallel Propbank
In our sense-tagging part of the project, we have
been using manual groupings of the English Word-
Net senses. These groupings were previously shown
to reconcile a substantial portion of the tagging dis-
agreements, raising inter-annotator agreement from
71% in the case of fine-grained WordNet senses to
82% in the case of grouped senses for the Sense-
val 2 English data (Palmer et al, to appear), and
currently to 89% for 93 new verbs (almost 12K in-
stances) (Palmer et al, 2004). The question which
arises, however, is how useful these grouped senses
are and whether the level of granularity which they
provide is sufficient for such applications as machine
translation from English to Chinese.
In a preliminary investigation, we randomly se-
lected 7 verbs and 5 nouns and looked at their corre-
sponding translations in the Chinese Propbank. As
the tables below show, for 6 verbs (join, pass, set-
tle, raise, appear, fight) and 3 nouns (resolution, or-
ganization, development), grouped English senses
map to unique Chinese translation sets. For a few
examples, which include realize and party, grouped
senses map to the same word in Chinese, preserving
the ambiguity. This investigation justifies the appro-
priateness of the grouped sense tags, and indicates
potential for providing a useful level of granularity
for MT.
3.3 Discourse connectives
Another component of the Chinese / English Parallel
Propbank II is the annotation of dis-course connec-
tives for both Chinese corpus and its English trans-
lation. Like the other two components, the anno-
tation is performed on the first 100K words of the
Parallel Chinese English Treebank. The annotation
of Chinese discourse connectives follows in large
part the theoretic assumptions and annotation prac-
tices of the English Penn Discourse Project (PDTB)
(Miltsakaki et al, 2004). Adaptations are made only
when they are warranted by the linguistic facts of
Chinese. While the English PTDB annotates both
explicit and implicit discourse connectives, our ini-

tial focus is on explicit discourse connectives. Ex-
plicit discourse connectives include subordinate (8)
and coordinate conjunctions (9) as well as discourse
adverbials (10). While subordinate and coordinate
conjunctions are easy to understand, discourse ad-
verbials need a little more elaboration. Discourse
adverbials differ from other adverbials in that they
relate two propositions. Typically one can be found
in the immediate context while the other may need
to be identified in the previous discourse.

ing correspondences between English and Chinese
discourse connectives. The examples in (11) show
that /(J0is polysemous and corresponds with
different expressions in English. It is a noun mean-

4 Conclusion
This paper presented preliminary results of the par-
allel PropBank II project. It highlighted some in-
teresting aspects of the differences between English
and Chinese, which play an important role for MT
and other applications. Some of the questions ad-
dressed had to do with how events are lexicalized
and aligned in the two languages, which level of
sense granularity is needed for MT from English
to Chinese, and highlighting notable differences be-
tween discourse connectives in the two languages.
Further investigation and alignment of the parallel
corpus, as well as richer annotation, will reveal other
interesting phenomena.
