Abstract 
We explore the role negation and speculation 
identification plays in the multi-label docu-
ment-level classification of medical reports for 
diseases. We identify the polarity of assertions 
made on noun phrases which reference dis-
eases in the medical reports. We experiment 
with two machine learning classifiers: one 
based upon Lucene and the other based upon 
BoosTexter. We find the performance of these 
systems on document-level classification of 
medical reports for diseases fails to show im-
provement when their input is enhanced by the 
polarity of assertions made on noun phrases. 
We conclude that due to the nature of our ma-
chine learning classifiers, information on the 
polarity of phrase-level assertions does not 
improve performance on our data in a multi-
label document-level classification task. 
1 Introduction 
In the medical domain, a substantial amount of 
patient data is stored as free text in patient medi-
cal report narratives (Spat et al 2008) and needs 
to be processed in order to be converted to more 
widely-useful structured information. These nar-
ratives contain a variety of useful information 
that can support syndromic surveillance (Shapiro 
2004), decision support (Fiszman et al 2000), 
and problem list generation (Sibanda et al 2006). 
Physicians often assert negative or speculative 
diagnoses in medical reports (Rao et al 2003) to 
keep track of all potential diagnoses that have 
been considered and to provide information that 
contrasts with the positive diagnoses (Kim and 
Park 2006). The noun phrases (NP) associated 
with negative and speculative assertions in medi-
cal reports may be confused with positively as-
serted NPs, thereby adversely affecting auto-
mated classification system performance.  In the 
medical domain, verbs often play a reduced role 
or are implied in assertions.  We therefore focus 
our investigation of assertions on NPs. 
In this paper, we describe the polarity of an 
assertion as being positive, speculative, or nega-
tive. Assertion classification is a generally ac-
cepted means for resolving problems caused by 
negation and speculation. Averbuch et al (2004) 
use context to identify negative/positive in-
stances of various symptoms. Mutalik et al 
(2001) show that the Unified Medical Language 
System (UMLS) Metathesaurus can be used to 
reliably detect negated concepts in medical nar-
ratives. Harkema et al (2009) develop ConText 
to determine not only positive and negative as-
sertions, but also assertions referencing someone 
other than the patient. 
The literature is filled with reports of systems 
which employ assertion classification (e.g., 
Google Scholar lists 134 documents citing 
Chapman et al?s (2001) NegEx). However, few 
reports describe how much assertion classifica-
tion contributes to the final system performance. 
Two exceptions are Goldstein et al (2007) and 
Ambert and Cohen (2009). 
Goldstein et al develop a hand-crafted rule 
based system to classify radiological reports 
from the 2007 Computational Medicine Center 
(CMC) Challenge (Pestian et al 2007). They 
show that negation and speculation play key 
roles in classifying their reports. Ambert and Co-
hen apply a machine learning (ML) approach to 
classifying discharge summaries from the 2008 
i2b2 Obesity Challenge (Uzuner 2008). They 
report that due to ?false negations,? simply add-
ing negation detection to their base system does 
not consistently improve performance. Prompted 
by these contradicting results in the literature, we 
explore the role assertion classification plays in 
the multi-label classification of medical reports 
from both the CMC and i2b2 challenges.  
We attempt to improve document-level classi-
fication performance of two multi-label ML clas-
sifiers by identifying the polarity of assertions on 
NPs. We experiment with medical reports from 
two different corpora. We detect NPs which ref-
erence diseases. We then identify the polarity of 
the assertion made for each NP. We show that 
enriching reports with the polarity of the asser-
tions does not improve performance for multi-
label document-level classification of medical 
23
reports into diseases in our corpora. Our findings 
imply that, despite common practice, the contri-
bution of assertion classification may be limited 
when employing ML approaches to predicting 
document-level labels of medical reports. 
2 Data 
The data were provided by the CMC challenge 
(Pestian et al 2007) and the i2b2 Obesity Chal-
lenge (Uzuner 2008). Both data sets had been de-
identified (anonymized) and, where appropriate, 
re-identified with surrogates. Our task is to de-
termine the presence of diseases in the patient 
based upon medical report narratives. The insti-
tutional review boards of the SUNY Albany and 
Partners HealthCare approved this study. 
2.1 CMC Data Set 
The CMC data set consists of a training set of 
978 radiology reports and a test set of 976 radi-
ology reports. Each report is labeled with 
ICD-9-CM (National Center for Health Statistics 
2010) standard diagnostic classification codes.  
The reports have been hand labeled with 45 
ICD-9-CM. Each code represents a distinct dis-
ease present in the patient. The codes reflect only 
the definite diagnoses mentioned in that report. 
At least one code is assigned to each report. Mul-
tiple codes per report are allowed. For each re-
port in the test set, we predict which diseases are 
present in the patient and label the report with 
the ICD-9-CM code for that disease. Any code 
not assigned to a report implies that the corre-
sponding disease is not present in the patient. 
2.2 i2b2 Data Set 
The i2b2 data set consists of a training set of 720 
discharge summaries and a test set of 501 dis-
charge summaries. These medical reports range 
in size from 133 words to more than 3000 words. 
The reports have been labeled for information on 
obesity and 15 of its most frequent co-
morbidities. For each report, each disease is la-
beled as being present, absent, or questionable in 
the patient, or unmentioned in the narrative. Mul-
tiple codes per report are allowed. 
Since we are interested in those diseases pre-
sent in the patient, we retain the present class and 
collapse the absent, questionable, and 
unmentioned categories into a not present class. 
For each report in the test set we predict whether 
each of the 16 diseases is present or not present 
in the patient. We label each report with our pre-
diction for each of the 16 diseases. 
3 Methods 
We preprocess the medical report narratives 
with a Noun Phrase Detection Pre-processor 
(NPDP) to detect noun phrases referencing dis-
eases. We implement our own version of Con-
Text (Harkema et al 2009), enhance it to also 
detect speculation, and employ it to identify the 
polarity of assertions made on the detected NPs. 
We expand the text of the medical reports with 
asserted NPs. We conflate lexical variations of 
words. We train two different types of classifiers 
on each of the training sets. We apply labels to 
both the expanded and non-expanded reports us-
ing two ML classifiers. We evaluate and report 
results only on the test sets. 
3.1 Noun Phrase and Assertion Detection  
We detect noun phrases via an NPDP. We build 
our NPDP based on MetaMap (Aronson 2001). 
The NPDP identifies NPs which reference dis-
eases in medical reports. We select 17 UMLS 
semantic types whose concepts can assist in the 
classification of diseases. First, NPDP maps NPs 
in the text to UMLS semantic types. If the 
mapped semantic type is one of the target seman-
tic types, NPDP then tags the NP. 
NPDP uses the pre-UMLS negation phrases of 
Extended NegEx (Sibanda et al 2006) to identify 
adjectives indicating the absence or uncertainty 
of each tagged NPs. It differentiates these adjec-
tives from all other adjectives modifying tagged 
NPs. For example, possible in possible reflux is 
excluded from the tagged NP, whereas severe in 
severe reflux is retained. We then identify the 
polarity of the assertion made on each NP. In 
order to distinguish the polarity of the assertions 
from one another, we do not modify the positive 
assertions, but transform the negative and specu-
lative assertions in the following manner: Sen-
tences containing negative assertions are re-
peated and modified with the NP pre-pended 
with ?abs? (e.g., ?Patient denies fever.? is re-
peated as ?Patient denies absfever.?). Similarly, 
sentences containing speculative assertions are 
repeated and modified with the NP pre-pended 
with ?poss?. We refer to these transformed terms 
as asserted noun phrases. We assert NPs for the 
unmodified text of both the data sets. Table 1 
provides a breakdown of the assertions for each 
of the detected NPs for each of the data sets. 
We examine the performance of our enhanced 
implementation of ConText by comparing its 
results against CMC test set NPs manually anno-
tated by a nurse librarian and author IG. Table 2 
24
shows the performance for each of the three po-
larities. We find these results to be comparable to 
those reported in the literature: Mutalik et al?s 
(2001) NegFinder finds negated concepts with a 
recall of .957; Chapman et al?s (2001) NegEx 
report a precision of .8449 and a recall of .8241.

3.2 Lucene Classifier  
We follow the k-Nearest Neighbor (Cover and 
Hart 1967) process previously described in Gold-
stein et al (2007) to build our Lucene-based 
classifier. Classification is based on the nearest 
training samples, as determined by the feature 
vectors. This approach assumes that similar 
training samples will cluster together in the fea-
ture vector space. The nearest training samples 
are considered to be those that are most similar 
to the data sample. 
We build our Lucene-based classifier using 
Apache Lucene (Gospodneti? and Hatcher 2005). 
We use the Lucene library to determine the simi-
larity of medical report narratives. We determine 
which training reports are similar to the target 
report based upon their text. For each target re-
port we retrieve the three most similar training 
reports and assign to the target report any codes 
that are used by the majority of these reports. In 
cases where the retrieved reports do not provide 
a majority code, the fourth nearest training report 
is used. If a majority code is still not found, a 
NULL code is assigned to the target report. 
We first run the Lucene Classifier on lower 
case, stemmed text of the medical reports. We 
refer to this as the Base Lucene Classifier run. 
We next run the Lucene Classifier on the text 
expanded with asserted noun phrases. We refer 
to this as the Asserted Lucene Classifier run. 
3.3 BoosTexter Classifier 
BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer 2000) builds 
classifiers from textual data by performing mul-
tiple iterations of dividing the text into subsam-
ples upon which weak decision-stub learners are 
trained. Among these weak learners, BoosTexter 
retains those that perform even marginally better 
than chance. After a set number of iterations, the 
retained weak learners are combined into the fi-
nal classifier. BoosTexter classifies text using 
individual words (unigrams), strings of consecu-
tive words (n-grams), or strings of non-
consecutive words, without considering seman-
tics. 
We cross-validate BoosTexter (tenfold) on the 
CMC training set. We establish the optimal pa-
rameters on the CMC training set to be 1100 it-
erations, with n-grams of up to four words. We 
find the optimal parameters of the i2b2 training 
set to be similar to those of the CMC training set. 
For consistency, we apply the parameters of 
1100 iterations and n-grams of up to four words 
to both data sets. In addition, we apply unigrams 
to BoosTexter in order to provide BoosTexter 
classifier results that are comparable to those of 
the Lucene classifiers. 
We create two classifiers with BoosTexter us-
ing the lower case, stemmed text of the medical 
reports: one with unigrams and one with 
n-grams. We refer to these as Base BoosTexter 
Classifier runs. For each of unigrams and 
n-grams, we create runs on the text expanded 
with the asserted noun phrases. We refer to these 
as Asserted BoosTexter Classifier runs. 
4 Evaluation 
We evaluate our classifiers on both the plain text 
of the reports and on text expanded with asserted 
NPs. We present results in terms of micro-
averaged precision, recall, and F1-measure 
(?zg?r et al 2005). We check the significance of 
classifier performance differences at ?=0.10. We 
apply a two-tailed Z test, with Z = ?1.645. 
5 Results and Discussion 
Table 3 and Table 4 show our systems? perform-
ances. We predict ICD-9-CM codes for each of 
the 976 CMC test reports. We predict whether or 
not each of 16 diseases is present in the patient 
for each of the 501 i2b2 test set reports.

The Asserted Lucene and BoosTexter Classi-
fier runs show no significant difference in per-
formance from their Base runs on either corpus. 
These results indicate that asserted noun phrases 
do not contribute to the document-level classifi-
cation of our medical reports 
5.1 Contribution of Asserted Noun Phrases 
Through analysis of the Base and Asserted runs, 
we find enough similarities in the text of the 
training and test reports for a given class to allow 
our ML classifiers to correctly predict the labels 
without needing to identify the polarity of the 
assertions made on individual NPs. For example, 
for the CMC target report 97729923: 
5-year-9-month - old female 
with two month history of 
cough. Evaluate for pneumonia. 
No pneumonia. 
the Base Lucene Classifier retrieves report 
97653364: 
Two - year-old female with 
cough off and on for a month 
(report states RSV nasal 
wash). 
No radiographic features of 
pneumonia. 
which allows the system to classify the target 
report with the ICD-9-CM code for cough. While 
identifying the polarity of the assertions for 
pneumonia strengthens the evidence for cough 
and not pneumonia, it cannot further improve the 
already correct document-level classification. 
These unenhanced assertions do not stand in the 
way of correct classification by our systems.  
5.2  Approach, Data, and Task 
Hand-crafted rule-based approaches usually 
encode the most salient information that the ex-
perts would find useful in classification and 
would therefore benefit from explicit assertion 
classification subsystems, e.g., Goldstein et al, 
(2007). On the other hand, ML approaches have 
the ability to identify previously undetected pat-
terns in data (Mitchell et al 1990). This enables 
ML approaches to find patterns that may not be 
obvious to experts, while still performing correct 
classification. Therefore, the contribution of as-
serted NPs appears to be limited when applied to 
ML approaches to document-level classification 
of medical reports. This is not to say that an ML 
approach to document-level classification will 
never benefit from identifying the polarity of 
NPs; only that on our data we find no improve-
ment.

Table 4 - BoosTexter Classifier?s Performance. 
The CMC and i2b2 data sets can each be de-
scribed as being homogenous; they come from a 
relatively small communities and limited geo-
graphic areas. In these data, variation in vocabu-
lary that might arise from the use of regional ex-
pressions would be limited. This would be espe-
cially true for the CMC data since it comes from 
a single medical department at a single hospital. 
It would not be surprising for colleagues in a 
given department who work together for a period 
of time to adopt similar writing styles and to em-
ploy consistent terminologies (Suchan 1995). 
Our task is one of multi-label document-level 
classification. Working at the document level, 
each negative and speculative assertion would 
play only a small role in predicting class labels. 
The homogeneity of the text in our data sets, 
and the task of document-level classification may 
have been factors in our results. Future research 
should examine how the characteristics of the 
data and the nature of the task affect the role of 
assertion classification. 
6 Conclusion 
Identifying the polarity of phrase-level assertions 
in document-level classification of medical re-
ports may not always be necessary. The specific 
task and approach applied, along with the charac-
teristics of the corpus under study, should be 
considered when deciding the appropriateness of 
assertion classification. The results of this study 
show that on our data and task, identifying the 
polarity of the assertions made on noun phrases 
does not improve machine learning approaches 
to multi-label document-level classification of 
medical reports.
