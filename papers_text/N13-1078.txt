Abstract
We adapt the popular LDA topic model (Blei
et al, 2003) to the representation of stylistic
lexical information, evaluating our model on
the basis of human-interpretability at the word
and text level. We show, in particular, that this
model can be applied to the task of inducing
stylistic lexicons, and that a multi-dimensional
approach is warranted given the correlations
among stylistic dimensions.
1 Introduction
In language, stylistic variation is a reflection of var-
ious contextual factors, including the backgrounds
of and relationship between the parties involved.
Although in the context of prescriptive linguistics
(Strunk and White, 1979), style is often assumed to
be a matter of aesthetics, the stylistic intuitions of
language users are inextricably linked to the conven-
tions of register and genre (Biber and Conrad, 2009).
Intentional or not, stylistic differences play a role
in numerous NLP tasks. Examples include genre
classification (Kessler et al, 1997), author profil-
ing (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009; Rosenthal and Mc-
Keown, 2011), social relationship classification (Pe-
terson et al, 2011), sentiment analysis (Wilson et al,
2005), readability classification (Collins-Thompson
and Callan, 2005), and text generation (Hovy, 1990;
Inkpen and Hirst, 2006). Following the classic work
of Biber (1988), computational modeling of style
has often focused on textual statistics and the fre-
quency of function words and syntactic categories.
When content words are considered, they are of-
ten limited to manually-constructed lists (Argamon
et al, 2007), or used as individual features for su-
pervised classification, which can be confounded by
topic (Petrenz and Webber, 2011) or fail in the face
of lexical variety. Our interest is models that offer
broad lexical coverage of human-identifiable stylis-
tic variation.
Research most similar to ours has focused on clas-
sifying the lexicon in terms of individual aspects rel-
evant to style (e.g. formality, specificity, readability)
(Brooke et al, 2010; Pan and Yang, 2010; Kidwell
et al, 2009) and a large body of research on the in-
duction of polarity lexicons, in particular from large
corpora (Turney, 2002; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007;
Velikovich et al, 2010). Our work is the first to rep-
resent multiple dimensions of style in a single statis-
tical model, adapting latent Dirichlet alocation (Blei
et al, 2003), a Bayesian ?topic? model, to our stylis-
tic purposes; as such, our approach also follows on
recent interest in the interpretability of topic-model
topics (Chang et al, 2009; Newman et al, 2011).
We show that our model can be used for acquisition
of stylistic lexicons, and we also evaluate the model
relative to theories of register variation and the ex-
pected stylistic character of particular genres.
2 Model
2.1 Linguistic foundations
In English manuals of style and other prescriptivist
texts (Fowler and Fowler, 1906; Gunning, 1952;
Follett, 1966; Strunk and White, 1979; Kane, 1983;
Hayakawa, 1994), writers are urged to pay atten-
tion to various aspects of lexical style, including el-
ements such as clarity, familiarity, readability, for-
673
mality, fanciness, colloquialness, specificity, con-
creteness, objectivity, and naturalness; these stylis-
tic categories reflect common aesthetic judgments
about language. In descriptive studies of register,
some researchers have posited a few fixed styles
(Joos, 1961) or a small, discrete set of situational
constraints which determine style and register (Crys-
tal and Davy, 1969; Halliday and Hasan, 1976); by
contrast, the applied approach of Biber (1988) and
theoretical framework of Leckie-Tarry (1995) offer a
more continuous interpretation of register variation.
In Biber?s approach, functional dimensions such
as Involved vs. Informational, Argumentative vs.
Non-argumentative, and Abstract vs. non-Abstract
are derived in an unsupervised manner from a
mixed-genre corpus, with the labels assigned de-
pending on where features (a small set of known in-
dicators of register) and genres fall on each spec-
trum. The theory of Leckie-Tarry posits a single
main cline of register with one pole (the oral pole)
reflecting a full reliance on the context of the lin-
guistic situation, and the other (the literate pole) re-
flecting a reliance on cultural knowledge. The more
specific elements of register are represented as sub-
clines which are strongly influenced by this main
cline, creating probabilistic relationships between
related dimensions (Birch, 1995).
For the present study, we have chosen 3 dimen-
sions (6 styles) which are clearly represented in the
lexicon, which are discussed often in the relevant lit-
erature, and which fit well into the Leckie-Tarry con-
ception of related subclines: colloquial vs. literary,
concrete vs. abstract, and subjective vs. objective. In
addition to a negative correlation between opposing
styles, we also expect a positive correlation between
stylistic aspects that tend toward the same main pole,
situational (i.e. colloquial, concrete, subjective) or
cultural (i.e. literary, abstract, objective). These cor-
relations can potentially interfere with accurate lex-
ical acquisition.
2.2 Implementation
Our main model is an adaption of the popular latent
Dirichlet alocation topic model (Blei et al, 2003),
with each of the 6 styles corresponding to a topic.
Briefly, latent Dirichlet alocation (LDA) is a gener-
ative Bayesian model: for each document d, a dis-
tribution of topics ?d is drawn from a Dirichlet prior
(with parameter ?). For each topic z, there is a prob-
ability distribution ?z1 corresponding to the proba-
bility of that topic generating any given word in the
vocabulary. Words in document d are generated by
first selecting a topic z randomly according to ?d ,
and then randomly selecting a word w according to
?z. An extension of LDA, the correlated topic model
(CTM) (Blei and Lafferty, 2007), supposes a more
complex representation of topics: given a matrix ?
representing the covariance between topics and ?
representing the means, for each document a topic
distribution ? (analogous to ? ) is drawn from the
logistic normal distribution. Given a corpus, good
estimates for the relevant parameters can be derived
using Bayesian inference.
For both LDA and CTM we use the original
variational Bayes implementation of Blei. Varia-
tional Bayes (VB) works by approximating the true
posterior with a simpler distribution, minimizing
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two
through iterative updates of specially-introduced
free variables. The mathematical and algorithmic
details are omitted here; see Blei et al (2003; 2007).
Our early investigations used an online, batch ver-
sion of LDA (Hoffman et al, 2010), which is more
appropriate for large corpora because it requires
only a single iteration over the dataset. We discov-
ered, however, that batch models were markedly in-
ferior to more traditional models for our purposes
because the influence of the initial model diminishes
too quickly; here, we need particular topics in the
model to correspond to particular styles, and we ac-
complish this by seeding the model with known in-
stances of each style (see Section 3). Specifically,
our initial ? consists of distributions where the entire
probability mass is divided amongst the seeds for
each corresponding topic, and a full iteration over
the corpus occurs before ? is updated. Typically,
LDA iterates over the corpus until a convergence re-
quirement is met, but in this case this is neither prac-
tical (due to the size of our corpus) nor necessarily
desirable; the diminishing effects of the initial seed-
ing means that the model may not stabilize, in terms
of its likelihood, until after it has shifted away from
our desired stylistic dimensions towards some other
1Some versions of LDA smooth this distribution using a
Dirichlet prior; here, though, we use the original formulation
from Blei (2003), which does not.
674
variation in the data. Therefore, we treat the optimal
number of iterations as a variable to investigate.
The model is trained on a 1 million text por-
tion of the 2009 version of the ICWSM Spinn3r
dataset (Burton et al, 2009), a corpus of blogs we
have previously used for formality lexicon induction
(Brooke et al, 2010). Since our method relies on co-
occurrence, we followed our earlier work in using
only texts with at least 100 different word types. All
words were tokenized and converted to lower-case,
with no further lemmatization. Following Hoffman
et al (2010), we initialized the ? of our models to
1/k where k is the number of topics. Otherwise we
used the default settings; when they overlap they
were identical for the LDA and CTM models.
3 Lexicon Induction
Our primary evaluation is based on the stylistic in-
duction of held-out seed words. The words were
collected from various sources by the first author
and further reviewed by the second; we are both
native speakers of English with significant experi-
ence in English linguistics. Included words had to
be clear, extreme members of their stylistic cate-
gory, with little or no ambiguity with respect to their
style. The colloquial seeds consist of English slang
terms and acronyms, e.g. cuz, gig, asshole, lol. The
literary seeds were primarily drawn from web sites
which explain difficult language in texts such as the
Bible and Lord of the Rings; examples include be-
hold, resplendent, amiss, and thine. The concrete
seeds all denote objects and actions strongly rooted
in the physical world, e.g. shove and lamppost, while
the abstract seeds all involve concepts which require
significant human psychological or cultural knowl-
edge to grasp, for instance patriotism and noncha-
lant. For our subjective seeds, we used an edited
list of strongly positive and negative terms from a
manually-constructed sentiment lexicon (Taboada et
al., 2011), e.g. gorgeous and depraved, and for our
objective set we selected words from sets of near-
synonyms where one was clearly an emotionally-
distant alternative, e.g. residence (for home), jocu-
lar (for funny) and communicable (for contagious).
We filtered initial lists to 150 of each type, remov-
ing words which did not appear in the corpus or
which occurred in multiple lists. For evaluation we
used stratified 3-fold crossvalidation, averaged over
5 different (3-way) splits of the seeds, with the same
splits used for all evaluated conditions.
Given two sets of opposing seeds, we follow our
earlier work in evaluating our performance in terms
of the number of pairings of seeds from each set
which have the expected stylistic relationship rel-
ative to each other (the guessing baseline is 0.5).
Given a word w and two opposing styles (topics) p
and n, we place w on the PN dimension according to
the ? of our trained model as follows:
PNw =
?pw??nw
?pw +?nw
The normalization is important because otherwise
more-common words would tend to have higher
PN?s, when in fact the opposite is true (rare words
tend to be more stylistically prominent). We then
calculate pairwise accuracy as the percentage of
pairs ?wp,wn? (wp ? Pseeds and wn ? Nseeds) where
PNwp >PNwn . However, this metric does not address
the case where the degree of a word in one stylistic
dimension is overestimated because of its status on
a parallel dimension. Two more-holistic alternatives
are total accuracy, the percentage of seeds for which
the highest ?tw is the topic t for which w is a seed
(guessing baseline is 0.17), and the average rank of
the correct t as ordered by ?tw (in the range 1?6,
guessing baseline is 3.5); the latter is more forgiving
of near misses.
We tested a few options which involved straight-
forward modifications to model training. Standard
LDA produces all tokens in the document, but when
dealing with style rather than topic, the number of
times a word appears is much less relevant (Brooke
et al, 2010). Our binary model assumes an LDA
that generates types, not tokens.2 A key comparison
2At the theoretical level, this move is admittedly problem-
atic, since our LDA model is thus being trained under the as-
sumption that texts with multiple instances of the same type can
be generated, when of course such texts cannot by definition ex-
ist. We might address this by moving to Bayesian models with
very different generative assumptions, e.g. the spherical topic
model (Reisinger et al, 2010), but these methods involve a sig-
nificant increase of computational complexity and we believe
that on a practical level there are no real negatives associated
with directly using a binary representation as input to LDA; in
fact, we are avoiding what appears to be a much more serious
problem, burstiness (Doyle and Elkan, 2009), i.e. the fact that

here is with a combined LDA model (combo), an
amalgamation of three independently trained 2-topic
models, one for each dimension; this tests our key
hypothesis that training dimensions of style together
is beneficial. Finally, we test against the correlated
topic model (CTM), which offers an explicit repre-
sentation of style correlation, but which has done
poorly with respect to interpretability, despite offer-
ing better perplexity (Chang et al, 2009).
The results of the lexicon induction evaluation
are in Table 1. Since the number of optimal iter-
ations varies, we report the result from the best of
the first five iterations, as measured by total accu-
racy; the best iteration is shown in parenthesis. In
general, all the results are high enough?we are re-
liably above 90% for the pairwise task, and above
50% for the 6-way task?for us to conclude with
some confidence that our model is capturing a sig-
nificant amount of stylistic variation. As predicted,
using words as boolean features had a net positive
gain, consistent across all of our metrics, though this
effect was not as marked as we have seen previously.
The model with independent training of each dimen-
sion (combo) did noticeably worse, supporting our
conclusion that a multidimensional approach is war-
ranted here. Particularly striking is the much larger
drop in overall accuracy as compared to pairwise ac-
curacy, which suggests that the combo model is cap-
turing the general trends but not distinguishing cor-
related styles as well. However, the most complex
model, the CTM, actually does slightly worse than
the combo, which was contrary to our expectations
but nonetheless consistent with previous work on the
interpretability of topic models. The performance of
the full LDA models benefited from a second itera-

tion, but this was not true of combo LDA or CTM,
and the performance of all models dropped after the
second iteration.
An analysis of individual errors reveals, unsur-
prisingly, that most of the errors occur across styles
on the same pole; by far the largest single com-
mon misclassification is objective words to abstract.
Of the words that consistently show this misclas-
sification across the runs, many of them, e.g. ani-
mate, aperture, encircle, and constrain are clearly
errors (if anything, these words tend towards con-
creteness), but in other cases the word in question
is arguably also fairly abstract, e.g. categorize and
predominant, and might not be labeled an error at
all. Other signs that our model might be doing bet-
ter than our total accuracy metric gives it credit for:
many of the subjective words that are consistently
mislabeled as literary have an exaggerated, literary
feel, e.g. jubilant, grievous, and malevolent.
4 Text-level Analysis
Our secondary analysis involved evaluating the ? ?s
of our best configuration (based on average pairwise
and total accuracy) on other texts. After training,
we carried out inference on the BNC corpus, aver-
aging the resulting ? ?s to see which styles are asso-
ciated with which genres. Appearances of the seed
terms for each model were disregarded during this
process; only the induced part of the lexicon was
used. The average differences relative to the mean
across the various stylistic dimensions (as measured
by the probabilities in ? ) are given for a selection of
genres in Table 2.
The most obvious pattern in table 2 is the domi-
nance of the medium: all written genres are positive
for our styles on the ?cultural? pole and negative for
styles on the ?situational? pole and the opposite is

true for spoken genres. The magnitude of this ef-
fect is more difficult to interpret: though it is clear
why fiction should sit on the boundary (since it con-
tains spoken dialogue), the appearance of news at
the written extreme is odd, though it might be due to
the fact that news blogs are the most prevalent for-
mal genre in the training corpus.
However, if we ignore magnitude and focus on the
relative ratios of the stylistic differences for styles
on the same pole, we can identify some individ-
ual stylistic effects among genres within the same
medium. Relative to the other written genres, for in-
stance, fiction is, sensibly, more literary and much
less objective, while academic texts are much more
abstract and objective; for the other two written gen-
res, the spread is more even, though relative to re-
ligious texts, news is more objective. At the sit-
uational pole, fiction also stands out, being much
more colloquial and concrete than other written gen-
res. Predictably, if we consider again the ratios
across styles, conversation is the most colloquial
genre here, though the difference is subtle.
We carried out a correlation analysis of the LDA-
reduced styles of all texts in the BNC and, con-
sistent with the genre results in Table 2, found a
strong positive correlation for all styles on the same
main pole, averaging 0.83. The average negative
correlation between opposing poles is even higher,
?0.88. This supports the Leckie-Tarry formulation.
The independence assumptions of the LDA model
did not prevent strong correlations from forming be-
tween these distinct yet clearly interrelated dimen-
sions; if anything, the correlations are stronger than
we would have predicted.
5 Conclusion
We have introduced a Bayesian model of stylistic
variation. Topic models like LDA are often evalu-
ated using information-theoretic measures, but our
emphasis has been on interpretibility: at the word
level we can use the model to induce stylistic lex-
icons which correspond to human judgement, and
at the text level we can use it distinguish genres in
expected ways. Another theme has been to offer ev-
idence that indeed a multi-dimensional approach is
strongly warranted: importantly, our results indicate
that separate unidimensional models of style are in-
ferior for identifying the core stylistic character of
each word, and in our secondary analysis we found
strong correlations among styles attributable to the
situational/cultural dichotomy. However, an off-the-
shelf model that integrates correlation among topics
did not outperform basic LDA.
One advantage of a Bayesian approach is in the
flexibility of the model: there are any number of
other interesting possible extensions at both the ?
and ? levels of the model, including alternative ap-
proaches to correlation (Li and McCallum, 2006).
Beyond Bayesian models, vector space and graphi-
cal approaches should be compared. More work is
clearly needed to improve evaluation: some of our
seeds could fall into multiple stylistic categories, so
a more detailed annotation would be useful.
