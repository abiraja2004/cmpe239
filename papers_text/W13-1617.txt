Abstract
This paper presents a method for sentiment
analysis specifically designed to work with
Twitter data (tweets), taking into account their
structure, length and specific language. The
approach employed makes it easily extendible
to other languages and makes it able to pro-
cess tweets in near real time. The main contri-
butions of this work are: a) the pre-processing
of tweets to normalize the language and gener-
alize the vocabulary employed to express sen-
timent; b) the use minimal linguistic process-
ing, which makes the approach easily portable
to other languages; c) the inclusion of higher
order n-grams to spot modifications in the po-
larity of the sentiment expressed; d) the use of
simple heuristics to select features to be em-
ployed; e) the application of supervised learn-
ing using a simple Support Vector Machines
linear classifier on a set of realistic data. We
show that using the training models generated
with the method described we can improve
the sentiment classification performance, irre-
spective of the domain and distribution of the
test sets.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) task dealing with the detection and clas-
sification of sentiments in texts. Usually, the classes
considered are ?positive?, ?negative? and ?neutral?,
although in some cases finer-grained categories are
added (e.g. ?very positive? and ?very negative?) or
only the ?positive? and ?negative? classes are taken
into account. Another related task - emotion detec-
tion - concerns the classification of text into several
classes of emotion, usually the basic ones, as de-
scribed by Paul Ekman (Ekman, 1992). Although
different in some ways, some of the research in the
field has considered these tasks together, under the
umbrella of sentiment analysis.
This task has received a lot of interest from the re-
search community in the past years. The work done
regarded the manner in which sentiment can be clas-
sified from texts pertaining to different genres and
distinct languages, in the context of various applica-
tions, using knowledge-based, semi-supervised and
supervised methods (Pang and Lee, 2008). The re-
sult of the analyses performed have shown that the
different types of text require specialized methods
for sentiment analysis, as, for example, sentiments
are not conveyed in the same manner in newspaper
articles and in blogs, reviews, forums or other types
of user-generated contents (Balahur et al, 2010).
In the light of these findings, dealing with sen-
timent analysis in Twitter requires an analysis of
the characteristics of such texts and the design of
adapted methods.
Additionally, the sentiment analysis method em-
ployed has to consider the requirements of the fi-
nal application in which it will be used. There is
an important difference between deploying a system
working for languages such as English, for which
numerous linguistic resources and analysis tools ex-
ist and a system deployed for languages with few
such tools or one that is aimed at processing data
from a large set of languages. Finally, a sentiment
analysis system working with large sets of data (such
as the one found in Twitter) must be able to process
texts fast. Therefore, using highly complex methods
may delay producing useful results.
In the light of these considerations, this paper
120
presents a method for sentiment analysis that takes
into account the special structure and linguistic con-
tent of tweets. The texts are pre-processed in or-
der to normalize the language employed and re-
move noisy elements. Special usage of language
(e.g. repeated punctuation signs, repeated letters)
are marked as special features, as they contribute to
the expressivity of the text in terms of sentiment.
Further on, sentiment-bearing words, as they are
found in three highly-accurate sentiment lexicons -
General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al, 1966), Linguis-
tic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Tausczik and
Pennebaker, 2010) and MicroWNOp (Cerini et al,
2007) - are replaced with unique labels, correspod-
ing to their polarity. In the same manner, modifiers
(negations, intensifiers and diminishers) are also re-
placed with unique labels representing their seman-
tic class. Finally, we employ supervised learning
with Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal
Optimization (SVM SMO) (Platt, 1998) using a
simple, linear kernel (to avoid overfitting of data)
and the unigrams and bigrams from the training set
as features. We obtain the best results by using
unique labels for the affective words and the mod-
ifiers, unigrams and bigrams as features and posing
the condition that each feature considered in the su-
pervised learning process be present in the training
corpora at least twice.
The remainder of this article is structured as fol-
lows: Section 2 gives an overview of the related
work. In Section 3, we present the motivations and
describe the contributions of this work. In the fol-
lowing section, we describe in detail the process fol-
lowed to pre-process the tweets and build the classi-
fication models. In Section 5, we present the results
obtained using different datasets and combinations
of features and discuss their causes and implications.
Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main findings of
this work and sketches the lines for future work.
2 Related Work
One of the first studies on the classification of po-
larity in tweets was (Go et al, 2009). The au-
thors conducted a supervised classification study on
tweets in English, using the emoticons (e.g. ?:)?,
?:(?, etc.) as markers of positive and negative tweets.
(Read, 2005) employed this method to generate a
corpus of positive tweets, with positive emoticons
?:)?, and negative tweets with negative emoticons
?:(?. Subsequently, they employ different supervised
approaches (SVM, Na??ve Bayes and Maximum En-
tropy) and various sets of features and conclude that
the simple use of unigrams leads to good results, but
it can be slightly improved by the combination of
unigrams and bigrams.
In the same line of thinking, (Pak and Paroubek,
2010) also generated a corpus of tweets for sen-
timent analysis, by selecting positive and negative
tweets based on the presence of specific emoticons.
Subsequently, they compare different supervised ap-
proaches with n-gram features and obtain the best
results using Na??ve Bayes with unigrams and part-
of-speech tags.
Another approach on sentiment analysis in tweet
is that of (Zhang et al, 2011). Here, the authors em-
ploy a hybrid approach, combining supervised learn-
ing with the knowledge on sentiment-bearing words,
which they extract from the DAL sentiment dictio-
nary (Whissell, 1989). Their pre-processing stage
includes the removal of retweets, translation of ab-
breviations into original terms and deleting of links,
a tokenization process, and part-of-speech tagging.
They employ various supervised learning algorithms
to classify tweets into positive and negative, using
n-gram features with SVM and syntactic features
with Partial Tree Kernels, combined with the knowl-
edge on the polarity of the words appearing in the
tweets. The authors conclude that the most impor-
tant features are those corresponding to sentiment-
bearing words. Finally, (Jiang et al, 2011) classify
sentiment expressed on previously-given ?targets?
in tweets. They add information on the context of
the tweet to its text (e.g. the event that it is related
to). Subsequently, they employ SVM and General
Inquirer and perform a three-way classification (pos-
itive, negative, neutral).
3 Motivation and Contribution
As we have seen in the previous section, several im-
portant steps have already been taken into analyzing
the manner in which sentiment can be automatically
detected and classified from Twitter data. The re-
search we described in previous section has already
dealt with some of the issues that are posed by short,
121
informal texts, such as the tweets. However, these
small snippets of text have several liguistic peculiar-
ities that can be employed to improve the sentiment
classification performance. We describe these pecu-
liarities below:
? Tweets are short, user-generated text that may
contain no more than 140 characters (strongly
related to the standard 160-character length of
SMS 1). Users are marked with the ?@? sign
and topics with the ?#? (hashtag) sign.
? In general, the need to include a large quantity
of information in small limit of characters leads
to the fact that tweets sometimes have no gram-
matical structure, contain misspellings and ab-
breviations.
? Some of the tweets are simply posted from
the websites of news providers (news agencies,
newspapers) and therefore they contain only ti-
tles of news. However, subjective tweets, in
which users comment on an event, are highly
marked by sentiment-bearing expressions, ei-
ther in the form of affective words, or by em-
ployins specific modalities - e.g. the use of
capital letters or repeated punctuation signs to
stress upon specific words. Most of the times,
these words are sentiment-bearing ones.
? The language employed in subjective tweets in-
cludes a specific slang (also called ?urban ex-
pressions? 2) and emoticons (graphical expres-
sions of emotions through the use of punctua-
tion signs).
? Most of the times, the topic that is discusses
in the tweets is clearly marked using hashtags.
Thus, there is no need to employ very complex
linguistic tools to determine it.
? In major events, the rate of tweets per minute
commenting or retweeting information sur-
passes the rate of thousands per minute.
? Twitter is available in more than 30 languages.
However, users tweet in more than 80 lan-
guages. The information it contains can be use-
ful to obtain information and updates about, for
1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter
2http://www.urbandictionary.com/
example, crisis events 3, in real time. In order to
benefit from this, however, a system processing
these texts has to be easily adaptable to other
languages and it has to work in near real time.
Bearing this in mind, the main contributions we
bring in this paper are:
1. The pre-processing of tweets to normalize the
language and generalize the vocabulary em-
ployed to express sentiment. At this stage, we
take into account the linguistic peculiarities of
tweets, regarding spelling, use of slang, punc-
tuation, etc., and also replace the sentiment-
bearing words from the training data with a
unique label. In this way, the sentence ?I love
roses.? will be equivalent to the sentence ?I like
roses.?, because ?like? and ?love? are both pos-
itive words according to the GI dictionary. If
example 1 is contained in the training data and
example 2 is contained in the test data, replac-
ing the sentiment-bearing word with a general
label increases the chance to have example 2
classified correctly. In the same line of thought,
we also replaced modifiers with unique corre-
sponding labels.
2. The use of minimal linguistic processing,
which makes the approach easily portable to
other languages. We employ only tokenization
and do not process texts any further. The reason
behind this choice is that we would like the fi-
nal system to work in a similar fashion for as
many languages as possible and for some of
them, little or no tools are available.
3. The inclusion of bigrams to spot modifications
in the polarity of the sentiment expressed. As
such, we can learn general patterns of senti-
ment expression (e.g. ?negation positive?, ?in-
tensifier negative?, etc.).
4. The use of simple heuristics to select features
to be employed. Although feature selection al-
gorithms are easy to apply when employing a
data mining environment, the final choice is in-
fluenced by the data at hand and it is difficult to
3http://blog.twitter.com/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-
resources-on-twitter.html
122
employ on new sets of data. After performing
various tests, we chose to select the features to
be employed in the classification model based
on the condition that they should occur at least
once in the training set.
5. The application of supervised learning using a
simple Support Vector Machines linear classi-
fier on a set of realistic data.
We show that using the training models generated
with the method described we can improve the sen-
timent classification performance, irrespective of the
domain and distribution of the test sets.
4 Sentiment Analysis in Tweets
Our sentiment analysis system is based on a hybrid
approach, which employs supervised learning with a
Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Opti-
mization (Platt, 1998) linear kernel, on unigram and
bigram features, but exploiting as features sentiment
dictionaries, emoticon lists, slang lists and other so-
cial media-specific features. We do not employ any
specific language analysis software. The aim is to
be able to apply, in a straightforward manner, the
same approach to as many languages as possible.
The approach can be extended to other languages by
using similar dictionaries that have been created in
our team. They were built using the same dictio-
naries we employ in this work and their corrected
translation to Spanish. The new sentiment dictionar-
ies were created by simultaneously translating from
these two languages to a third one and considering
the intersection of the trainslations as correct terms.
Currently, new such dictionaries have been created
for 15 other languages.
The sentiment analysis process contains two
stages: pre-processing and sentiment classification.
4.1 Tweet Pre-processing
The language employed in Social Media sites is dif-
ferent from the one found in mainstream media and
the form of the words employed is sometimes not
the one we may find in a dictionary. Further on,
users of Social Media platforms employ a special
?slang? (i.e. informal language, with special expres-
sions, such as ?lol?, ?omg?), emoticons, and often
emphasize words by repeating some of their letters.
Additionally, the language employed in Twitter has
specific characteristics, such as the markup of tweets
that were reposted by other users with ?RT?, the
markup of topics using the ?#? (hash sign) and of
the users using the ?@? sign.
All these aspects must be considered at the time of
processing tweets. As such, before applying super-
vised learning to classify the sentiment of the tweets,
we preprocess them, to normalize the language they
contain. The pre-processing stage contains the fol-
lowing steps:
? Repeated punctuation sign normalization
In the first step of the pre-processing, we detect
repetitions of punctuation signs (?.?, ?!? and
???). Multiple consecutive punctuation signs
are replaced with the labels ?multistop?, for
the fullstops, ?multiexclamation? in the case of
exclamation sign and ?multiquestion? for the
question mark and spaces before and after.
? Emoticon replacement
In the second step of the pre-processing, we
employ the annotated list of emoticons from
SentiStrength4 and match the content of the
tweets against this list. The emoticons found
are replaced with their polarity (?positive? or
?negative?) and the ?neutral? ones are deleted.
? Lower casing and tokenization.
Subsequently, the tweets are lower cased and
split into tokens, based on spaces and punctua-
tion signs.
? Slang replacement
The next step involves the normalization of the
language employed. In order to be able to
include the semantics of the expressions fre-
quently used in Social Media, we employed the
list of slang from a specialized site 5.
? Word normalization
At this stage, the tokens are compared to entries
in Rogets Thesaurus. If no match is found, re-
peated letters are sequentially reduced to two or
one until a match is found in the dictionary (e.g.
4http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/
5http://www.chatslang.com/terms/social media
123
?perrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfeeect? becomes ?perrfeect?,
?perfeect?, ?perrfect? and subsequently ?per-
fect?). The words used in this form are maked
as ?stressed?.
? Affect word matching
Further on, the tokens in the tweet are matched
against three different sentiment lexicons: GI,
LIWC and MicroWNOp, which were previ-
ously split into four different categories (?pos-
itive?, ?high positive?, ?negative? and ?high
negative?). Matched words are replaced with
their sentiment label - i.e. ?positive?, ?nega-
tive?, ?hpositive? and ?hnegative?. A version
of the data without these replacements is also
maintained, for comparison purposes.
? Modifier word matching
Similar to the previous step, we employ a list
of expressions that negate, intensify or dimin-
ish the intensity of the sentiment expressed to
detect such words in the tweets. If such a word
is matched, it is replaced with ?negator?, ?in-
tensifier? or ?diminisher?, respectively. As in
the case of affective words, a version of the data
without these replacements is also maintained,
for comparison purposes.
? User and topic labeling
Finally, the users mentioned in the tweet, which
are marked with ?@?, are replaced with ?PER-
SON? and the topics which the tweet refers to
(marked with ?#?) are replaced with ?TOPIC?.
4.2 Sentiment Classification of Tweets
Once the tweets are pre-processed, they are passed
on to the sentiment classification module. We em-
ployed supervised learning using SVM SMO with a
linear kernel, based on boolean features - the pres-
ence or absence of n-grams (unigrams, bigrams and
unigrams plus bigrams) determined from the train-
ing data (tweets that were previousely pre-processed
as described above). Bigrams are used specifically
to spot the influence of modifiers (negations, inten-
sifiers, diminishers) on the polarity of the sentiment-
bearing words. We tested the approach on differ-
ent datasets and dataset splits, using the Weka data
mining software 6. The training models are built on
a cluster of computers (4 cores, 5000MB of mem-
ory each). However, the need for such extensive re-
sources is only present at the training stage. Once
the feature set is determined and the models are built
using Weka, new examples must only be represented
based on the features extracted from the training set
and the classification is a matter of miliseconds.
The different evaluations scenarios and results are
presented in the following section.
5 Evaluation and Discussion
Although the different steps included to eliminate
the noise in the data and the choice of features have
been refined using our in-house gathered Twitter
data, in order to evaluate our approach and make it
comparable to other methods, we employ three dif-
ferent data sets, which are described in detail in the
following subsections.
5.1 Data Sets
? SemEval 2013 Data
The first one is the data provided for training
for the upcoming SemEval 2013 Task 2 ?Sen-
timent Analysis from Twitter? 7. The initial
training data has been provided in two stages:
1) sample datasets for the first task and the sec-
ond task and 2) additional training data for the
two tasks. We employ the joint sample datasets
as test data (denoted as t?) and the data released
subsequently as training data (denoted as T?).
We employ the union of these two datasets to
perform cross-validation experiments (the joint
dataset is denoted as T ? +t?. The character-
istics of the dataset are described in Table 1.
On the last column, we also include the base-
line in terms of accuracy, which is computed as
the number of examples of the majoritary class
over the total number of examples:
? Set of tweets labeled with basic emotions.
The set of emotion-annotated tweets by (Mo-
hammad, 2012), which we will denote as
TweetEm. It contains 21051 tweets anno-
tated according to the Ekman categories of ba-
6http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
7http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task2/
124
sic emotion - anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness,
surprise. We employ this dataset to test the re-
sults of our best-performing configurations on
the test set. This set contains a total of 21051
tweets (anger - 1555, disgust - 761, fear - 2816,
joy - 8240, sadness - 3830, surprise - 3849). As
mentioned in the paper by (Mohammad, 2012),
a system that would guess the classes, would
perfom at aroung 49.9% accuracy.
? Set of short blog sentences labeled with basic
emotions.
The set of blog sentences employed by (Aman
and Szpakowicz, 2007), which are annotated
according to the same basic emotions identi-
fied by Paul Ekman, with the difference that the
?joy? category is labeled as ?happy?. This test
set contains also examples which contain no
emotions. These sentences were removed. We
will denote this dataset as BlogEm. This set
contains 1290 sentences annotated with emo-
tion (anger - 179, disgust - 172, fear - 115, joy -
536, sadness - 173, surprise - 115). We can con-
sider as baseline the case in which all the ex-
amples are assigned to the majority class (joy),
which would lead to an accuracy of 41.5%.

5.2 Evaluation and Results
In order to test our sentiment analysis approach, we
employed the datasets described above. In the case
of the SemEval data, we performed an exhaustive
evaluation of the possible combination of features
to be employed. We tested the entire dataset of
tweets (T*+t*) using 10-fold cross-validation. The
first set of evaluations concerned the use of the pre-
processed tweets in which the affective words and
modifiers were have not been replaced. The com-
bination of features tested were: unigrams (U ), bi-
grams (B), unigrams and bigrams together (U +B)
and unigrams and bigrams together, selecting only
the features that appear at least twice in the data
(U +B+FS). The second set of evaluations aimed
at quantifying the difference in performance when
the affective words and the modifiers were replaced
with generic labels. We tested the best performing
approaches from the first set of evaluations (U + B
and U +B+FS), by replacing the words that were
found in the affect dictionaries and the modifiers
with their generic labels. These evaluations are de-
noted as U + B + D and U + B + D + FS. The
results of these evaluations are shown in Table 2.
Features 10-f-CV T*+t*
U 71.82

The same experiments are repeated by employing
T* as training data and t* as test data. The aim of
these experiments is to test how well the method can
perform on new data. The results of these evalu-
ations are shown in Table 3. In order to test if in-

deed the use of sentiment dictionaries, modifiers and
the simple feature selection method improves on the
best performing approach that does not employ these
additional features, we tested both the approaches on
the TweetEm and BlogEm datasets. In this case,
125
however, the classification is done among 6 differ-
ent classes of emotions. Although the results are
lower(as it can be seen in Table 4, they are compara-
ble to those obtained by (Mohammad, 2012) (when
using U+B) and show an improvement when using
the affect dictionaries and simple feature selection.
They also confirm the fact that the best performance
on the data is obtained replacing the modifiers and
the words found in affect dictionaries with generic
labels, using unigrams and bigrams as and eliminat-
ing those n-grams that appear only once.

U +B +D + FS 51.08 53.70
Table 4: Results in terms of accuracy for the different
combination of features for the emotion classification of
tweets and short blog sentences.
The results obtained confirm that the use of uni-
gram and bigram features (appearing at least twice)
with generalized affective words and modifiers ob-
tains the best results. Although there is a signifi-
cant improvement in the accuracy of the classifica-
tion, the most important difference in the classifica-
tion performance is given by the fact that using this
combination, the classifier is no longer biased by the
class with the highest number of examples. We can
notice this for the case of tweets, for which the con-
fusion matrices are presented in Table 5 and Table
6. In the table header, the correspondence is: a =
joy, b = fear, c = surprise, d = anger, e = disgust, f
= sadness. In the first case, the use of unigrams and
bigrams leads to the erroneous classification of ex-
amples to the majoritary class. When employing the
features in which affective words and modifiers have
been replaced with generic labels, the results are not
only improved, but they classifier is less biased to-
wards the majoritary class. In this case, the incorrect
assignments are made to classes that are more sim-
ilar in vocabulary (e.g. anger - disgust, anger - sad-
ness). In the case of surprise, examples relate both
to positive, as well as negative surprises. Therefore,
there is a similarity in the vocabulary employed to
both these classes.

5.3 Discussion
From the results obtained, we can conclude that, on
the one hand, the best features to be employed in
sentiment analysis in tweets are unigrams and bi-
grams together. Secondly, we can see that the use of
generalizations, by employing unique labels to de-
note sentiment-bearing words and modifiers highly
improves the performance of the sentiment classi-
fication. The usefulness of pre-processing steps is
visible from the fact that among the bigrams that
were extracted from the training data we can find
the unique labels employed to mark the use of re-
peated punctuation signs, stressed words, affective
words and modifiers and combinations among them.
Interesting bigrams that were discovered using these
generalizations are, e.g. ?negative multiexclama-
tion?, ?positive multiexclamation?, ?positive multi-
stop? - which is more often found in negative tweets
-,?negator positive?, ?diminisher positive?, ?mostly
diminisher?, ?hnegative feeling?, ?hnegative day?,
?eat negative?,?intensifier hnegative?. All these ex-
tracted features are very useful to detect and classify
sentiment in tweets and most of them would be ig-
nored if the vocabulary were different in the train-
126
ing and test data or if, for example, a stressed word
would be written under different forms or a punctu-
ation sign would be repeated a different number of
times. We can see that the method employed obtains
good results, above the ones reported so far with the
state-of-the-art approaches. We have seen that the
use of affect and modifier lexica generalization has
an impact on both the quantitative performance of
the classification, as well as on the quality of the re-
sults, making the classifier less biased towards the
class with a significantly larger number of exam-
ples. In practice, datasets are not balanced, so it is
imporant that a classifier is able to assign (even in-
correctly) an example to a class that is semantically
similar and not to a class with totally opposite affec-
tive orientation. In this sense, as we have seen in the
detailed results obtained on the TweetEm dataset,
it is preferable that, e.g. the examples pertaining to
the emotion classes of anger and sadness are mis-
takenly classified as the other. However, it is not
acceptable to have such a high number of examples
from these classes labeled as ?joy?. Finally, by in-
specting some of the examples in the three datasets,
we noticed that a constant reason for error remains
the limited power of the method to correctly spot the
scope of the negations and modifiers. As such, we
plan to study the manner in which skip-bigrams (bi-
grams made up of non-consecutive tokens) can be
added and whether or not they will contribute to (at
least partially) solve this issue.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this article, we presented a method to classify
the sentiment in tweets, by taking into account their
peculiarities and adapting the features employed to
their structure and content. Specifically, we em-
ployed a pre-processing stage to normalize the lan-
guage and generalize the vocabulary employed to
express sentiment. This regarded spelling, slang,
punctuation, etc., and the use of sentiment dictio-
naries and modifier lists to generalize the patterns
of sentiment expression extracted from the training
data. We have shown that the use of such general-
ized features significantly improves the results of the
sentiment classification,when compared to the best-
performing approaches that do not use affect dictio-
naries. Additionally, we have shown that we can
obtain good results even though we employ min-
imal linguistic processing. The advantage of this
approach is that it makes the method easily appli-
cable to other languages. Finally, we have shown
that the use of a simple heuristic, concerning filter-
ing out features that appear only once, improves the
results. As such, the method is less dependent on the
dataset on which the classification model is trained
and the vocabulary it contains. Finally, we employed
a simple SVM SMO linear classifier to test our ap-
proach on three different data sets. Using such an
approach avoids overfitting the data and, as we have
shown, leads to comparable performances on differ-
ent datasets. In future work, we plan to evaluate
the use of higher-order n-grams (3-grams) and skip-
grams to extract more complex patterns of sentiment
expressions and be able to identify more precisely
the scope of the negation. Additionally, we plan to
evaluate the influence of deeper linguistic process-
ing on the results, by performing stemming, lem-
matizing and POS-tagging. Further on, we would
like to extend our approach on generalizing the se-
mantic classes of words and employing unique la-
bels to group them (e.g. label mouse, cat and dog as
?animal?). Finally, we would like to study the per-
formance of our approach in the context of tweets
related to specific news, in which case these short
texts can be contextualized by adding further con-
tent from other information sources.
