I. REL  Eng l i sh  in Terms of Modern  L ingu is t i cs  
REL ,  a Rapidly Extensible Language System, is an 
integrated information system operating in conversational inter- 
action with the computer. It is intended for work  with large or 
small data bases by means  of highly individualized languages. The 
architecture of REL  is based on theoretical assumptions about 
human information dynamics \[I\], among them the expanding 
process of conceptualization in working with data, and the idio- 
syncratic language use of the individual workers. The result of 
these assumptions is a system which allows the construction of 
highly individualized languages which are closely knit with the 
structure of the data and which can be rapidly extended and 
augmented with new concepts and structures through a facile 
definitional capability. The REL  language processor is designed 
to accommodate  a variety of languages whose structural charaCter- 
istics may be considerably divergent. 
The REL  English is one of the languages within the REL  
system. It is intended to facilitate sophisticated work  with com-  
puters without the need for mastering programming languages. 
I 
The structural power of REL  English matches the extremely 
f lex ib le  o rgan izat ion  of data  in r ing  fo rms.  Extens ions  of the 
bas ic  REL  Eng l i sh  language can be ach ieved  e i ther  th rough 
",. _ _  
def in ing  new concepts  and  s t ruc tures  in te rms  of the ex is t ing  ones  
or  th rough add i t ion  of new ru les .  
The REL  d ia lec t  and id io lec ts  
Eng l i sh  is  our  p r imary  mode of verba l  communicat ion ,  
there fore  everyone  has  the r ight  to know what  someone e l se  means  
by it. We use  the te rm "Eng l i sh"  in i ts  most  o rd inary  sense ,  i .e .  
we bear  in mind  the fact  that  there  rea l ly  is  no one Eng l i sh  lan -  
guage .  Rather ,  the tern~ Eng l i sh  re fe rs  to as  many  id io lec ts  as  
there  a re  speakers ,  these  id io lec ts  be ing  grouped into d ia lec ts .  
The REL  Eng l i sh  i s  one such  d ia lec t .  It shares  wi th  natura l  l an -  
guage a l so  the character i s t i c  of  be ing ,  in i ts  des ign  and funct ion -  
ing,  a cong lomerate  of id io lec ts ,  wh ich  we cal l  vers ions .

bas i s  for  the assumpt ion  of  ind iv idua l ,  id io lec ta l  approach  to the 
use  of in fo rmat ion .  
REL  Eng l i sh  as  a fo rmal  language 
The second bas ic  character i s t i c  is  that  REL  Eng l i sh  is  a 
fo rmal  language.  The character i s t i cs  of Eng l i sh  as  a fo rmal  
language are  d i scussed  in  an  ear l ie r  paper  \[3\]. The 
cent ra l  thes i s  of  that  paper  i s  that  Eng l i sh  becomes  a fo rmal  
language when the sub jec t  mat ter  wh ich  it ta lks  about  is l im i ted  to 
mater ia l  whose  in ter re la t ionsh ips  a re  spec i f iab le  ina  l im i ted  
number  of  p rec i se ly  s t ruc tured  categor ies .  It is  the type of 
2 
s t ruc turat ion  of the sub jec t  mat ter  and not the nature  of the sub ject  
mat ter  i t se l f  that  p roduces  the necessary  l im i ta t ions .  Natura l  
language encompasses  a mul t i tude  of fo rmal  languages  and it is the 
complex i t ies  of the memory  s t ruc tures  on which  natura l  language 
can  and does  operate  that  account  for the complex i t ies ,  f lex ib i l i ty  
and r i chness  of natura l  language.  These  la t te r  give r i se  to the 
notor ious  prob lem of ambigu i t ies  in natura l  language ana lys i s .  
Arnb igu i t ies  
What about ambigu i t ies  in REL  Eng l i sh?  The purpose  of I~EL 
Eng l i sh  grammar  is to p rov ide  a language fac i l i ta t ing  work  wi th  
computers .  It is  thus assumed that  the language is used  for  a 
spec i f i c  purpose  in a spec i f i c  context .  A l lowance for  ambigu i t ies  at 
the phrase  leve l ,  w i th  subsequent  d i sambigu i t ion  through context ,  is 
a power fu l  mechan ism in a language.  It is  th is  aspect  of ambigu i ty  
we w ish  to inc lude.  
Ambigu i t ies ,  in the genera l  case  and in our case ,  a re  due to 
d i f fe rent  semant ic  in terpreta t ions  (data s t ruc turat ion)  a r i s ing  f rom 
d i f fe rent  deep s t ruc tures .  Ambiguous  const ruct ions  a re  of two 
main  types-  (1) those  wh ich  are  s t ruc tura l ly  ambiguous ,  e .g .  , 
'Bos ton  sh ips"  is ambiguous  over  al l  re la t ions  ex is t ing  between 
"Boston"  and "sh ips"  (bui lt  in Boston, w i th  home por t  in Boston ,  
etc .  ); and (Z) those  wh ich  are  semant ica l ly  ambiguous ,  e .g .  , 
~ locat ion of K ing"  if  "K ing"  can  re fer  both to Capta in  King and the 
3 
dest royer  King in the data e lements .  Ambigu i t ies  of the f i r s t  type 
can be reso lved  by the spec i f i ca t ion  of the re la t ion ,  those  of the 
second type by inc lus ion  of la rger  context .  Chomsky 's  we l l -known 
example  of an ambiguous  entence  "F ly ing  p lanes  can be dangerous"  
is of the f i r s t  type; Katz and Fodor ' s  "bache lor "  is of the second 
type. The purpose  of REL  sentence  ana lys i s  is not to find all 
poss ib le  in terpreta t ions  of ambiguous  entences  i r respect ive  of 
context .  Rather ,  the purpose  is max imal  d i sambiguat ion  where  
such d i sambiguat ion  is poss ib le  in te rms of semant ic  in terpreta -  
t ion, p rov id ing  for  the preservat ion  of ambigu i t ies  p resent  in 
memory  s t ruc tures  if the syntact i c  fo rm of the query  is ambiguous .  
Nature  of res t r i c t ions  
How does  our Eng l i sh  compare  wi th  Eng l i sh  as d i scussed  by 
modern  l ingu is ts?  On the leve l  of sur face  s t ruc ture ,  they are  
essent ia l l y  the same.  Some more  complex  t rans format iona l ly  
der ived  s t r ings ,  such as cer ta in  fo rms of e l ips i s  are  not hand led  as 
yet.  However ,  most  of the common fo rms are  t reated  in a s t ra ight -  
fo rward  manner .  A l though some const ruct ions  which can be fo rmed 
in natura l  conversat iona l  Eng l i sh  a re  not p rov ided  in the bas ic  
Eng l i sh  package ,  such de f i c ienc ies  can to a la rge  extent  be over -  
come by the capab i l i ty  for  de f in i t iona l  extens ion  prov ided  by the 
sys tem.  
The leve l  of deep s t ruc ture  presents  more  prob lems.  As 
4 
d is t inc t  f rom sur face  s t ruc ture ,  deep s t ruc ture  is  that  leve l  of 
syntact i c  ana lys i s  wh ich  const i tu tes  the input  to semant ic  ana lys i s ,  
both  in Chomsky 's  \[4\] te rms  and ours .  What  is  the nature  of  th i s  
semant ic  in terpreta t ion?  
In the genera l  case ,  l i t t le  is  known.  In our  case ,  as  in most  
types  of computer  ana lys i s ,  in te rpreta t ion  is in te rms  of the in terna l  
fo rms  of o rgan izat ion  of  the data  in memory .  To the extent  that  the 
const i tuents  of  deep  s t ruc ture  can  be d i rec t ly  cor re la ted  w i th  
cor respond ing  s t ruc tures  in the  data ,  semant ic  ana lys i s ,  and there -  
fo re  sentence  ana lys i s ,  can  be car r ied  to complet ion .  
It i s  impor tant  to d i s t ingu ish ,  in th i s  regard ,  between two 
qu i te  d i s t inc t  though re la ted  ways  in wh ich  language use  can  be 
res t r i c ted .  The  f i r s t  is  by the ways  in wh ich  the data  is  o rgan ized ,  
that  is  the s t ruc tura l  fo rms  used  and the in ter l inkages  wh ich  are  
fo rmed for  the man ipu la t ion  of  these  s t ruc tures .  Th is  type we wi l l  
ca l l  " s t ruc tura l "  res t r i c t ions .  The second is  by res t r i c t ions  of the 
sub jec t  mat ter ,  o r  the un iverse  of d i scourse ;  th i s  we wi l l  ca l l  "d i s -  
course"  res t r i c t ions .  When one res t r i c ts  the un iverse  of d i scourse  
to a body of mater ia l  wh ich  is  natura l l y  fo rmal  or  has  been  fo rmal -  
i zed ,  one o f ten  tac i t l y  accepts  the s t ruc tura l  res t r i c t ions  thus  im-  
I 
posed .  To the un in i t ia ted ,  it  may  appear  that  it  is  the d i scouse  
l im i ta t ions  and not  the imp l ied  s t ruc tura l  l im i ta t ions  that  make  the 
mater ia l  amenab le  to mach ine  ana lys i s .  However ,  it  i s  the  es tab-  
5 
l i shment  of re la tab i l i t?  between deep s t ruc tura l  const i tuents  and 
data  s t ruc tura l  fo rms ,  ra ther  than  d i scourse  res t r i c t ions  that  make  
computer  p rocess ing  of the semant ic  component  poss ib le .  Any con-  
tent  a rea  whose  data  is  o rgan ized  into these  g iven  s t ruc tura l  fo rms  
can  be equa l ly  e f f i c ient ly  p rocessed  by a sys tem estab l i sh ing  such  
in ter  r e la t ionsh ip  s.  
The res t r i c t ions  on REL  Eng l i sh  a re  a funct ion  of the f i r s t  
type of  res t r i c t ions ,  i . e . ,  s t ruc tura l  res t r i c t ions .  Not al l  deep 
s t ruc tures  found in natura l  Eng l i sh  a re  brought  out by our  
ana lys i s ,  because  const i tuents  of these  deep s t ruc tures  do not  
cor respond to s t ruc tura l  re la t ions  in the  organ izat ion  of our  data .  
For  instance, "collections of boys" and "boys' collections" are con- 
sidered synonyn~ous, although they are not in English. Consider: 
"At the fair, I saw collections of boys. " and "At the fair, I saw 
boys' collections. " 
F ina l ly ,  a l im i ta t ion  in reverse ,  as  it  were ,  is  the fac t  that  
we have  emphas ized  the inc lus ion  of g rammat ica l  s t r ings  ra ther

tu res  of the data  bases .  The language processor ,  descr ibed  in 
detail in the accompanying paper \[5\], builds a sentence analysis 
Phrase-marker .  The sentence is interpreted by successive appli- 
cation of the corresponding semantic transformations in accordance 
with the parsing. The application of semantic rules to the consti- 
tuents of a complex phrase produces the interpretation of the phrase 
or, if the phrase is semantically meaningless, an indication of that 
to the language processor. 
The parts of speech of REL  English are given in Figure I, 
together with examples. These parts of speech are inclusive terms 
for syntactic classes (labels on the parsing tree), and semantic 
categories (memory  structures). 
Function words, e. g. , al__!l, o__ff, wha_.___tt, are distinct f rom 
referent words; the former are empty in the sense of not being 
associated with memory  structures. Other aspects of the grarnrnar, 
namely  features, name and relation modification, verbs, clauses, 
I 
quantifiers and conjunctions, are discussed in detail in the remairder 
of the paper.

There  are  th ree  sh ips :  l~aru,  P in ta  and Nina. 
The  respect ive  locat ions  of these  sh ips  a re :  Boston,  
Boston  and New York. 
Boston,  New York  and Chicago are  c i t ies .  
The respect ive  popu la t ions  of these  c i t ies  a re  3205, 11366 
and 6689, in thousands. 
Figures Z and 3 illustrate how ring structures contain this environ- 
ment. Let us follow these rings. Links f rom the SHIP  ring lead to 
Maru, Pinta and Nina. The arrow at intersection points on the SHIP 
ring pointing down and on the Maru, Pinta and Nina pointing up 
indicate the c lass -member  relationship: Pinta is a member  of the 
class SHIP. This exemplifies ring structures which relate classes 
of objects and individual objects. The other type of ring structure 
are  b inary  re la t ions  between r ings .  If we fo l low now the l ink f rom 
the P in ta  r ing  th rough the  locat ion  r ing ,  we reach  the Boston  r ing .  
The re la t ion  of locat ion  ho lds  between P in ta  and  Boston ,  thus ,  in  
p red icate  notat ion ,  we can  say :  locat ion  (P inta,  Boston) .  The 
symbo ls  0, 1 and 2 re fe r  to the order  in th i s  re la t ionsh ip .  
Number  re la t ions ,  such  as  popu lat ion ,  re la te  a r ing  to a 
number :  popu la t ion  (Boston,  3205). They  ex is t  as  l inks  w i th in  the  
respect ive  r ings  to  wh ich  they  re fe r .  However ,  the  numer ica l  data  
i t se l f  is  in the  r ing  to wh ich  it app l ies .  Thus  one f inds  a re fe rent  to 
popu la t ion  on the  Boston  r ing;  and assoc ia ted  w i th  the re fe rent  to

R ing s t ruc tures  a re  a l so  bu i l t  dur ing  ana lys i s  of sentences  and

What  a re  the locat ions  of sh ips?  
the  semant ic  t rans format ion  assoc ia ted  w i th  the 'N -~ R of N' ru le  
w i l l  bu i ld  a sc ra tch  r ing  of a l l  l ocat ions  of sh ips ,  in the  par t i cu la r  
case  at hand,  Boston  and New York.  Th is  sc ra tch  r ing  wi l l  be in ter -  
re la ted  to the  data  base  in  the  same manner  as  permanent  r ings  and 
thus  wi l l  par t i c ipate  in  fu r ther  ana lys i s  in  a s t ra ight fo rward  way.  
Upon complet ion  of the  ana lys i s  and response  to the g iven  sentence ,  
the  l inks  to th i s  sc ra tch  r ing  and the sc ra tch  r ing  i t se l f  wi l l  be 
de le ted  f rom other  r ings  of the  data base .  
A second type  of sc ra tch  r ing  is  a number  r ing ,  that  is  a r ing  
a l l  of whose  ent r ies  a re  numer ica l  data .  \]For example ,  the  phrase :  
'popu la t ions  of c i t ies '  w i l l  resu l t  in  the  c reat ion  of such  a number  
r ing  conta in ing  the  numbers  3205, 11366, 6689. The syntact i c  
resu l t  of 'popu la t ion  of c i t ies '  has  par t  of speech  U, and the number  
r ing  feature  (d i scussed  below) des ignates  the character  of the  under -  
ly ing  s t ruc ture .  
Ru les  such  as  'U -~ average  U' ,  or  'U -~ sum of U' app ly  to 
number  r ings .  New data can  be entered  s imp ly  f rom the conso le ,  
for  example  that  the  Santa  Mar ia  is  a sh ip  located  in  Boston :  
def: Santa Mar ia :  = name I 
The  Santa  Mar ia  is  a ship'. 
The  locat ion  of the Santa  Mar ia  is  Boston~ 
Th is  wi l l  resu l t  in the  c reat ion  of a r ing  fo r  Santa  Mar ia  and a 
11 
l inking r ing between that  r ing,  locat ion  and Boston.  
Features  and The i r  Funct ions  
Features  const i tu te  an impor tant  and power fu l  mechan ism in 
REL.  We use  the te rm in the genera l  Cbomsky  sense  \[4\], but wi th  
some s ign i f i cant  mod i f i ca t ions .  Some aspects  of the operat ion  of 
features  f rom the point of v iew of the language processor  a re  d i s -  
cussed  in \[5\]. Summar i ly ,  the ro le  of features  is subcategor i za t ion ,  
determinat ion  of syntact i c  const ruct ions  and order  of syntact i c  
g r ouping s. 
(a) There  are  only two semant ic  features  in the present  REL  
Eng l i sh .  The tense  character  of the verb  is  a feature  ass igned  to the 
ind iv idual  lex ica l  i tem.  The feature  d i s t ingu ish ing  a number  r ing 
f rom a number  is ass igned  to a data s t ruc ture  wh ich  in a sense  is 
a l so  t reated  as a lex ica l  i tem in sentence  ana lys i s .  
Co) Morphemic  features  subcategor i ze  syntact i ca l ly  par ts  of 
speech .  These  inc lude the Nominat ive /Possess ive  and S ingu lar /  
P lu ra l  subcategor i za t ions  of Nouns and Re lat ions ;  and the S ingular  
and Par t i c ip le  subeategor i za t ions  of Verbs .  Morphemic  features  
often funct ion asprecedence  markers  as wel l .  Thus checks  on 
Nora . /Poss .  and S ing . /P lu ra l  features  fo rce  the fo l lowing pars ing :  
( ( (smal l  ( computer  s))') (word size)) 
excluding such parsings as: 
( smal l  ( ( (computer  s)') (word s ize)))  
12 
(c) The pass ive  voice feature  of verbs  is set  by the verb  "to be"  
used  as an aux i lary .  Once set,  it s igna ls  o ther  rout ines  to appropr i -  
a te ly  handle sub ject  and object ,  essent ia l l y  keying the pass ive  t rans -  
fo rmat ion .  The negat ion  feature  on the verb  is set  by "not" and its 
cont rac ted  fo rms.  
(d) P recedence  features .  The remain ing  features  determine  
the app l i cab i l i ty  of ru les  and the order  of the i r  app l i ca t ion  to fo rm 
syntact i c  g roup ings .  On N and R they  are :  
determiner  - -  wh ich  prevents  fu r ther  mod i f i ca t ion  
e .g .  the the bal l ,  big the bal l ,  a re  exc luded.  
phrasa l  - -  wh ich  prevents  the app l i ca t ion  of cer ta in  
morphemic  ru les  to a syntact i ca l ly  mod i f ied  phrase .  
p re -mod i f i ca t ion  and post -mod i f i ca t ion  - -  which cause  
the fo l lowing const i tuent  ana lys i s :  
e .g .  (the (dent ist  (son of (Sally Smith))))  
not: (((the dent is t )  son) of (Sally Smith))  
They  a lso  a re  used  to ma inta in  para l le l  const ruct ion  
in con junct ive  phrases .  
e .g .  ((JohnWs son) and (Mary 's  daughter ) )  
not: John 's  (son and (Mary 's  daughter ) )  
whi le :  (Mary 's  (uncles and aunts))  
not: ( (Mary 's  unc les )  and aunts)  
On the V phrases ,  r ight  mod i f i ca t ion  and sub jec t  features  p lay a 
13 
s imi la r  ro le .  Aux i la r ies  must  go on be fore  r ight  mod i f i ca t ion ;  r ight  
mod i f i ca t ion  must  be completed  before  the sub jec t  can go on. 
e .g .  ( John (((wil l  marry )  Joan)  be fore  1970)) 
not:  ( ( John (wil l  (marry  Joan)) )  be fore  1970) 
The impor tance  of p recedence  features  is  that  they  sharp ly  
curtail redundant  pars ings.  Thus  the rules:

relation modification. Figure 6 shows the possible constructions, 
together with grammar  rules for relation modification. Semantic 
transformations for name modification rules recursively resolve 
this list structure. For example, in the analysis of the phrase: 
John's male child's location 
"Male child's location" gives rise to the cornplex R: 
composition \[modification \[male, child\], location\]. 
Then the name modification rule is applied to: "John's R", whose 
semantic transformation expands the complex R, developing the 
location of each "male (child of John)". 
Relation modification plays an important role in definitions 
of complex concepts. It is employed widely in elevating lanEuages 
beyond the base level of primitive relationships. This can be 
exemplified in family relationship situations. For instance, given 
the "parent" and "identity 9' relations as primitive, the following 
series of definitions introduces the relation "uncle": 
def:child:converse of parent 
def:son:male child 
c le f :s ib l ing :ch i ld  of parent  and not ident i ty  
de f :b ro ther  :ma le  s ib l ing

def:per capita "GNP":"GNP"/populat ion 
Complex  relations of this sort function in such expressions as 
"Average per capita area of nations". 
The  Verb  
We are accustomed to the traditional definition saying that a 
verb denotes an action or a state: an action is per formed by an actor 
(subject) on an object, a state is a momentar i ly  or permanently 
frozen action between subjects and objects. Thus, an action, in this 
inclusive sense, is characterized by (i) the aspect of beginning, 
ending, duration or momentar iness;  (Z) by its situation in time, and 
(3) by referring to subjects and objects. Two groups of verbs may 
be distinguished: those referring to a relation between subjects and 
objects, and those which establish a connection between them. The 
relation expressed by a verb constitutes (and is here referred to as) 
its 'predicate'; such verbs are called relation verbs. Relation verbs 
also express temporal aspects of a relation. Typical relation verbs 
are "arrive" and "leave"; both refer to the relation of 'location'; 
"arrive" refers to the beginning of the existence of this relation, 
and "leave" to its ending. For  instance, "John left Boston" means  
that the relation of 'location' existing between John and Boston came 
to an end. Verbs which express a connection between subjects and 
objects are referred to as copulas, e.g. "is" in "John is a boy". 
The copula itself constitutes the predicate.

1. Re la t ion  Verbs  
Each  of the four  fo l lowing sentences  conta ins ,  in sur face  
s t ruc ture ,  a d i f fe rent  verb .  
(1) John ar r ived  in Boston.  
(ii) John left Boston.  
(iii) John l ived in Boston.  
(iv) John is res id ing  in Boston.  
The under ly ing  s t ruc ture  of these  sentences  is  ident ica l :  ' l ocat ion  
(John, Boston) ' ,  except  for  the tempora l  aspect  of th is  re la t ion :  
beginning in (i), ending in (ii), momentar iness  in (iii) and durat ion  
in (iv). In REL  Eng l i sh ,  the tempora l  aspect  is  denoted by the 
' tense  character '  feature .  
Verbs  a re  in t roduced  through language extens ion .  They are  
def ined in te rms of a re la t ion  and a tense  character .  The re la t ion  
must  denote an a l ready  ex is t ing  r ing s t ruc ture .  Thus,  g iven the 
re la t ion  of " locat ion" ,  the verb  "ar r ive"  is def ined by: 
de f :a r r ive :verb  ( location, 1). 
A verb  is in terna l ly  represented  as a "verb  tab le" ,  with par t  
of speech  V. In the verb  tab le  for  "a r r ive" ,  ' l ocat ion '  is entered  
as pred icate  and '1' as tense  character ,  ind icat ing  beginn ing.  
In i t ia l ly ,  the verb  table  is ass igned  the present  tense ,  or 'now-  
hess ' .  Th is  can he subsequent ly  mod i f ied  by verb  morpho logy ,  
18 
aux i l i a ry  verbs ,  and tense  mod i f ie rs  ( tempora l  phrases  or  c lauses) .  
Z. Copula verbs  
Copula verbs  have a verb  tab le  wh ich  has a copula pred icate  
and (at p resent )  no tense  character .  The copulas  a re :  " i s " ,  "a re" ,  
"was" ,  "were" ,  and the i r  cont rac ted  negat ives .  For  example ,  the 
ru le  'C -* wasn ' t '  wi l l  resu l t  in the c reat ion  of a verb  tab le  wi th  a 
copula pred icate ,  t ime equal  to past ,  and the feature  of negat ion.  
3. Verb  tab le  mod i f i ca t ion  
The e lements  of a verb  tab le  cor respond to the e lements  of a 
kerne l  c lause  (i. e. one wi th  a s ing le  deep s t ruc ture  Phrase-marker ) .  
They  are :  sub ject ,  p red icate ,  ob ject ,  tense  character ,  and t imes  
t l ,  t 2. The sub jec ts  and ob jec ts  of the kerne l  may be N (names) and 
U (numbers} .  The pred icate  is  a re la t ion .  The types  of the tense  
character  a re  d i scussed  above.  The t imes  on a verb  tab le  ind icate  
a point  or  in terva l  w i th in  the span bounded by past  (0) and fu ture  (~). 
The t 1 and t 2 e i ther  both spec i fy  a s ing le  point  or  b ind an in terva l  of 
t ime in wh ich  the event  ind icated  by the c lause  takes  p lace .  
REL  verbs  a re  marked  by three  regu lar  in f lec t iona l  mor -  
phemes:  past  tense ,  pas t  par t i c ip le ,  and 3rd person  s ingu lar .  
The funct ion  of in f lec t iona l  morphemes  and aux i l i a ry  verbs  is  two-  
fold: mod i f i ca t ion  of the or ig ina l  t ime in the verb  tab le  and set t ing  
of syntact i c  features .  For  example ,  the past  tense  morpheme and 
the aux i l i a ry  "d id"  mod i fy  t 1 to be past ,  thus es tab l i sh ing  the t ime 
19 
i n te rva l  '0 to  now'  (i. e. t 1 = 0, t 2 = now);  the  aux i l i a ry  "w i l l "  mod i -  
f i es  t 2 to  be  fu ture ,  thus  es tab l i sh ing  t 1 = now,  t 2 = = ; 3 rd  person  
s ingu lar  and  aux i l i a r ies  "has"  and  "does"  se t  the  s ingu lar  feature .  
T ime mod i f ie rs  (M) fu r ther  mod i fy  the  verb  tab le .  They  or ig i -  
nate  f rom prepos i t iona l  t ime phrases ,  e .g .  "be fore  1960 ~v, and  sub-  
o rd inate  c lauses ,  e .g .  "be fore  John  ar r ived  in  Boston  N. The  t imes  
of  the  o r ig ina l  verb  tab le  (or  as  mod i f ied  th rough the  past  morpheme 
and/or  aux i l i a r ies )  a re  fu r ther  mod i f ied  so  as  to be  in  accord  w i th  
t ime mod i f ie rs .  Thus ,  in  the  sentence  "Wi l l  J ohn  ar r ive  be fore  
19707 ,t the  verb  tab le  fo r  "a r r ive"  has  t l ,  t 2 - now;  mod i f i ca t ion  
by  "w i l l "  changes  t 2 to  '~ ' ;  mod i f i ca t ion  by  "be fore  1970 '~ changes  
t 2 to  '1970' ,  thus  resu l t ing  in the  in tersected  t ime in terva l  'between 
now and  1970' .  
Sub jec ts  and  ob jec ts  a re  inser ted  in  the  verb  tab le  upon  app l i -  
ca t ion  of  the  ru les :  
(i) V -* N V ( ru le  put t ing  sub jec t  on) 
(i i) V -* V N ( ru le  put t ing  ob jec t  on) 
(iii) V -* VbyN.  
These  rules also check whether  the passive feature is on (set by 
copulas forming passives), and if it is, rule (i) converts the N into 
an object; rule (ii) converts the N into a subject; rule (iii) applies 
only if the passive feature is on and converts the N into a subject. 
Number  subjects and objects do not participate in the passive trans- 
20 
fo rmat ion .  
Negat ion is handled by a feature  on the verb  tab le .  It is set  by 
ru les  process ing  "not"  wi th  copu las ,  both in i so la t ion  and cont rac ted ,  
and ru les  process ing  "not"  with verbs .  They  d i f fe r  syntact i ca l ly  in 
the pos i t ion  of "not" .  If the negat ive  feature  is  a l ready  set  by a pre -  
v ious  ru le ,  the resu l t  is  pos i t i ve  (i. e. double negat ives  tu rn  into a 
pos i t i ve ) .  
Let  us cons ider  an example  of verb  tab le  accumulat ion  ( f igure 
7). The deve lopment  of the verb  tab le  shows the success ive  mod i f i -  
ca t ion  due to the verb  ru les  wh ich  have appl ied.  The pars ings  re f lec t  
the use  of features  wh ich  e l iminate  some poss ib le  pars ings  wh ich  are  
incor rec t  or i r re levant  to the ana lys i s ,  and determine  the order  of 
pars ing .  
C lause  Process ing  
The accumulated  verb  tab le  const i tu tes  the input to the c lause  
process ing  rout ine .  The verb  tab le  may be e i ther  complete ,  i .e .  
have al l  i ts  pos i t ions  f i l led,  or  e l se  have sub jec ts  or  ob jec ts  miss ing .  
The c lause  processor  completes  the verb  tab le  if  necessary ,  and 
re turns  it together  w i th  a l i s t  of t imes  for  wh ich  the c lause  ho lds ,  
and another  l i s t  of t imes  fo r  wh ich  it does  no~ hold. The resu l t s  of 
the c lause  processor  a re  subsequent ly  used  by the sentence  ru les  to 
produce  output, or  by the subord inate  c lause  ru les .

The  ru les  fo r  hand l ing  quest ions  a re :  (S s tands  fo r  sentence ,

Ru le  (i) resu l t s  in  a yes /no  output  depend ing  on whether  the  re la t ion

The  output  may be  ambiguous .  For  example ,  "D id  Smi th  l i ve

The  output  i s  a Vacuous  Descr ip t ion  i f  there  i s  no  va l id  seman-

income of the  present  k ing  of  F rance?  " the  phrase  "present  k ing  of  
F rance"  is  a vacuous  descr ip t ion  in  te rms  of our  data  i f  the  data

verb  tab le  in  (i) must  not  be  mod i f ied ;  and  the  pred icate  of  the  verb  
tab le  in  (ii) must  be  a copu la .  
The  s t ruc ture  of  the  input  sentence  determines  the  s t ruc tura l  
re la t ions  to  be  es tab l i shed  between i tems in  the  data .  
Subord inate  c lauses  mod i fy  some i tem in  another  c lause ,  o r  
another  c lause  as  a who le .  In  REL  Eng l i sh ,  c lauses  of  the  f i r s t  type  
are  a lways  re la t ive  c lauses ;  they  are  in t roduced  by  the  pronouns  
"who" ,  "wh ich" ,  " that" ,  "whom" and  "whose" .  C lauses  mod i fy ing

and  "when" ,  and  resu l t  in  t ime mod i f i ca t ion .  
Examples  of  re la t ive  c lauses :  
(i) N -~ N who V Did the  boy  who le f t  Bos ton  marry  
J i l l ?  
(ii) N -* N that  V Was  Boston  the  c i ty  that  John  le f t?  
(i i i)  N -* N whose  R V Did the  boy  whose  fa ther  le f t  Bos ton

Verb  tab les  represent ing  re la t ive  c lauses  a re  completed  us ing

sub jec t  of  the  verb  tab le ,  in  (ii) e i ther  as  sub jec t  o r  ob jec t .  In  (i i i)  
the  N fo r  wh ich  the  re la t ion  R ho lds  i s  used  as  sub jec t  o r  ob jec t .  
Para l le l  to  the  above  ru les  a re  ru les  w i th  a comma preced ing  
the  re la t ive  pronoun.  However ,  the  ru les  w i th  commas app ly  on ly  
24 
to post-modified NXs and the comma plays a disambiguating function. 
For instance, "parents of boys who left Boston" can be ambiguous; 
in our English, the relative clause refers to "boys", while in 
"parents  of boys ,  who  lef t  Boston"  the re la t ive  c lause  re fers  to 
"parents  ". 
Examples  of tempora l  c lauses :  
(i) M -~ before  V Did John  marry  J i l l  be fore  J i l l  left

(ii) M "~ when V What  was  John 's  income when Stan l ived

The output  of ru le  (i) i s  a t ime mod i f ie r  w i th  the  t ime in terva l  t 1 = 0, 
t 2 = date  spec i f ied  by  the  subord inate  c lause .  In the  subsequent  
ana lys i s  these  t imes  are  compared  w i th  the  t imes  on the  main  c lause  
in  the  same way as  t ime mod i f ie rs  such  as  "be fore  1960. "  For  
ins tance ,  let  us  assume that  John  marr ied  J i l l  in  1950 and that  J i l l  
le f t  Boston  in  1955. The  output  of ru le  (i) w i l l  now be the in terva l

o . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  ? 
The resu l t  i s ,  obv ious ly ,  a "yes"  answer .  The  output  of ru le  (ii) i s

subord inate  c lause .  
Quant i f ie  r s 
By "quant i f ie rs"  we  re fer  to  "a l l " ,  " some" ,  "how many" ,  
"what" ,  "each"  and "no" .  Phrases  conta in ing  such  words  are  of 
i 
25 
par t i cu la r  impor tance  s ince  they  o f ten  are  used  in re fer r ing  to

Some examples  a re :

How many Smi ths  have  an  income greater  than  12000? 
What  was  the average  between 1950 and 1960 of the  incomes  of 
each  Smi th?  
In such  sentences ,  a c lass  of ob jec ts  i s  cons idered .  The  
sentence  const i tu tes  a cond i t ion  on each  e lement  of th i s  c lass ,  the 
cond i t ion  depend ing  on the  par t i cu la r  quant i f ie r .  Cons ider  in deta i l  
the example :  " I s  Boston  the  locat ion  of a l l  men?  " To  answer  th i s  
quest ion ,  each  man must  be cons idered  in  tu rn .  We app ly  the te rm 
generat ion  to  th i s  k ind of a process .  As  each  man i s  generated  in 
tu rn ,  say  man. ,  the sentence  " I s  Boston  the  locat ion  of man.?  " 
must  be processed .  I f  the  answer  to a l l  cases  is  "yes" ,  then  the  
or ig ina l  quest ion  is  answered  a f f i rmat ive ly ;  o therwise ,  it  is  
answered  negat ive ly .  In the case  of the "some '~ generator ,  the 
answer  wou ld  be a f f i rmat ive  if at  leas t  one of the  men l i ves  in 
Boston .  For  the  quest ion  "What  men l ive  in  Boston?  , i  the  answer  
is  the l i s t  of men fo r  whom the  c lause  "man.  l i ves  in Boston"  ho lds .

Severa l  generators  can  be nested  in a sentence .  An example  
i s :  ~'Each Smi th  l i ved  in what  c i t ies?  " In genera l ,  the nest ing  of 
generators  poses  d i f f i cu l t  and cha l leng ing  prob lems.  A l though we
