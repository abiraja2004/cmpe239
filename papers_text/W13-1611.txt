Abstract
We compare the performance of two lexicon-
based sentiment systems ? SentiStrength
(Thelwall et al, 2012) and SO-CAL (Taboada
et al, 2011) ? on the two genres of newspaper
text and tweets. While SentiStrength has been
geared specifically toward short social-media
text, SO-CAL was built for general, longer
text. After the initial comparison, we suc-
cessively enrich the SO-CAL-based analysis
with tweet-specific mechanisms and observe
that in some cases, this improves the perfor-
mance. A qualitative error analysis then iden-
tifies classes of typical problems the two sys-
tems have with tweets.
1 Introduction: Twitter, SentiStrength and
SO-CAL
In recent years, microblogging has been an attrac-
tive new target for sentiment analysis. The question
studied in this paper is how the methods used for
?standard? newspaper text can be transferred to mi-
croblogs. We focused on the Twitter network be-
cause of its widespread use, and because Twitter
communication, in response to emerging issues, is
fast and especially ad hoc, making it an effective
platform for the sharing and discussion of crisis-
related information (Bruns/Burgess, 2011). Further-
more, Twitter is characterized by a high topicality of
content (Milstein al., 2008).
Specifically, we present experiments involving
two sentiment analysis systems that both employ
a combination of polarity lexicon and sentiment
composition rules: (i) SentiStrength (Thelwall et
al., 2012), a system that is geared toward short
social-media text, and (ii) SO-CAL (Taboada et al,
2011), ?Semantic Orientation Calculator?, a general-
purpose system that was designed primarily to work
on the level of complete texts. While both are
lexicon-based approaches, there are certain differ-
ences in the roles of the various submodules. For our
purposes here, it is important that SentiStrength was
designed to cope specifically with ?user-generated
content?. Among the features of the system, as
stated by Thelwall et al, the following four are espe-
cially important for tweets: (i) a simple spelling cor-
rection algorithm deletes repeated letters when the
word is not found in the dictionary; (ii) repeated let-
ters lead to a boost in sentiment value; (iii) an emoti-
con list supplements the polarity lexicon; (iv) pos-
itive sentences ending in an exclamation mark re-
ceive an additional boost, and multiple exclamation
marks further strengthen the polarity.
SO-CAL, on the other hand, does not include
social-media-specific measures. In contrast, it was
designed for determining semantic orientation on
the text level; in our experiments here, we are thus
using it for the non-intended purpose of sentence-
level sentiment, on tweet ?sentences?.
Next, we review related work on twitter sentiment
analysis (Section 2), and describe the data sets for
our experiments in Section 3. Then we investigate
the relative performance of SentiStrength and SO-
CAL on newspaper text and on tweets (Section 4),
including experiments with preprocessing steps. In
Section 5, we present observations from a qualitative
evaluation, and we interpret the results and conclude
in Section 6.

2 Related work
Following the work on ?standard? text, sentiment
classification on tweets is often treated as a two-step
task, e.g., (Barbosa/Feng, 2010): subjectivity classi-
fication followed by polarity classification. For sub-
jectivity classification, (Pak/Paroubek, 2010) found
that the distribution of POS tags is a useful feature,
due to, for example, the presence of modal verbs in
subjective tweets.
For polarity assignment, one approach is to au-
tomatically build large sets of training data and
then train classifiers on token n-grams; in this vein,
(Pak/Paroubek, 2010) found that in their approach,
bigrams outperform unigrams and trigrams, and
they report f-measures around 0.6 for the three-
way pos/neg/neutral classification. The other, non-
learning, approach is to rely on a polarity wordlist
(or a collection of several, as in (Joshi et al, 2011;
Mukherjee et al, 2012)). Mukherjee et al report
an accuracy of 66.69% for pos/neg, and 56.17% for
pos/neg/neut classification.
Typical preprocessing steps employed by the
approaches discussed are the correction of mis-
spellings, the replacement of URLs and hashtags,
the translation of emoticons and of slang words.
Sometimes, stop word removal and stemming is
used; sometimes deliberately not. Few authors eval-
uate the influence of the various measures; one ex-
ception is (Mukherjee et al, 2012).
A recent branch of research deals with fine-
grained target-specific analysis (as proposed re-
cently by (Jiang et al, 2011)). In our work, how-
ever, we tackle the more coarse-grained problem
of assigning a single sentiment value to a complete
tweet. However, we will return to the issue of target-
specificity in our conclusions.
An interesting result from analysing the state of
the art is that apparently no consensus has been
reached yet on the question of ?extra difficulty? of
tweet sentiment analysis. While everybody agrees
that tweets are noisy and can pose considerable diffi-
culty to any standard linguistically-inspired analysis
tool, it is not clear to what extent this is a problem
for sentiment analysis. Some authors argue that the
noise renders the task more difficult than the anal-
ysis of longer text, while others maintain that the
brevity of tweets is in fact an advantage, because ? as
(Bermingham/Smeaton, 2010) put it, ?the short doc-
ument length introduces a succinctness to the con-
tent?, and thus ?the focused nature of the text and
higher density of sentiment-bearing terms may ben-
efit automated sentiment analysis techniques.? In
their evaluation, the classification of microblogs in-
deed yields better results than that of blogs.
In correspondence with this open question, there
are only few investigations so far on the performance
differences for existing sentiment tools operating on
newspaper versus social media text. To shed more
light on the issue, we chose to run a set of com-
parative experiments with the two aforementioned
lexicon/rule-based systems, on both newspaper and
twitter corpora.
3 Data sets
MPQA The well-known MPQA corpus1 (Wiebe
et al, 2005) of newspaper text has fine-grained an-
notations of ?private states? at phrase level. For our
purposes these need to be reduced to a more coarse-
grained labelling of sentence-level sentiment. To
avoid ambiguity, we ignored those sentences that in-
clude both positive and negative sentiment annota-
tions. From the remaining sentences, we selected
100 positive and negative sentences each, where the
former target-specific sentiment is now taken to rep-
resent sentence-level sentiment. The data set is a
difficult one, given that we are dealing with isolated
sentences from newspaper reports.
Qantas To track Twitter data we used a self-
developed prototype (see (Stieglitz/Kaufhold,
2011)). We concentrate our analysis on Qantas, an
Australian leading carrier for long-haul air travel,
for which we assume substantial interest in public
communication. We furthermore expect that ?
caused by some management crises in 2011 ? online
communication around Qantas-related topics is
characterized by a strong emotional investment of
stakeholders.
The tracking tool captures all those tweets that
contain the keyword ?Qantas? in their content, in the
username of the sender, or in a URL. After spam re-
moval, we had a dataset of some 27,000 tweets, col-
lected between mid-May and mid-November 2011.

Table 1: Distribution of tweets and labels across subcor-
pora
For evaluation purposes, 300 Tweets have been man-
ually annotated by two annotators in parallel, using
a polarity scale ranging from -2 to 2. 190 Tweets of
those (63%) received identical labels, and we used
only this set in our experiments described below.
That means we also discarded cases of ?minor? dis-
agreement such as a -1/-2 annotation.
Sanders The Sanders corpus2 is a corpus consist-
ing of 5513 tweets of various languages which have
been annotated for sentiment. The tweets have been
sampled by the search terms ,,@apple?, ,,#google?,
,,#microsoft? and ,,#twitter?. Each tweet is accom-
panied by a date-time stamp and the target of its po-
larity. Possible polarity values are positive, negative,
neutral (simple factual statements / questions with-
out strong emotions / neither positive nor negative /
both positive and negative), and irrelevant (spam /
non-English). The positive and negative tweets thus
contain judgements on the companies or their prod-
ucts/services. Along with the corpus comes an anno-
tation scheme and statistics about the corpus. Some
numbers of the size and distribution within the cor-
pus are given in Table 1.
According to the annotation guidelines, positive
and negative labels were only assigned to clear cases
of sentiment. Ambigious tweets have been anno-
tated as neutral.
4 Experiments and results
4.1 Performance on MPQA sentences
In order to establish a basis for the comparison, we
first ran a small comparative evaluation on ?stan-
dard? text, i.e., on the sentences from the MPQA
newspaper corpus. The results, given in Table 2,
show that both systems perform considerably better

4.2 Performance on Qantas and Sanders tweets
In Table 3, we show the system performance on the
Twitter corpora: Qantas, the complete Sanders cor-
pus, and the Sanders subcorpus with target ?Twit-
ter?. We ran evaluations on all four separate sub-
corpora, but only ?Twitter? showed interesting dif-
ferences from the results for the total corpus, and
that is why they are included in the table. The ?acc?
row gives the overall weighted accuracy. ?Avg senti-
ment? is the absolute value of the sentiment strength
determined by SentiStrength and SO-CAL; notice
that these should not be compared between the two
systems, as they do not operate on the same scale.
(We will return to the role of sentiment strength in
Section 6.)

4.3 Preprocessing steps
Since SO-CAL was not intended for analyzing Twit-
ter data, we implemented three preprocessing steps
to study whether noise effects of this text genre can
be reduced. Similarly to the steps suggested by
(Mukherjee et al, 2012), we first unified all URLs,
e-mail addresses and user names by replacing them
with unique tokens. Additionally, in step 1 all hash
marks were stripped from words, and emoticons
were mapped to special tokens representing their
emotion categories. These special tokens were then
added to the polarity lexicons used by SO-CAL.
In step 2, social media specific slang expressions
and abbreviations like ?2 b? (for ?to be?) or ?im-
sry? (for ?I am sorry?) were translated to their ap-
propriate standard language forms. For this, we used
a dictionary of 5,424 expressions that we gathered
from publicly available resources.3
In the last step, we tackled two typical spelling
phenomena: the omission of final g in gerund forms
(goin), and elongations of characters (suuuper). For
the former, we appended the character g to words
ending with -in if these words are unknown to vo-
cabulary,4 while the corresponding ?g?-forms are in-
vocabulary words (IVW). For the latter problem,
we first tried to subsequently remove each repeat-
ing character until we hit an IVW. For cases re-
sisting this treatment, we adopted the method sug-
gested by (Brody/Diakopoulos, 2011) and generated
a squeezed form of the prolongated word, subse-
quently looking it up in a probability table that has
previously been gathered from a training corpus.
Altogether, SO-CAL does not benefit from pre-
processing in the Qantas corpus, but it does help for
the pos/neg tweets from the Sanders corpus, espe-
cially for the Twitter subcorpus. The observation
that the accuracy on neutral tweets decreases while
the average sentiment increases will be discussed
in Section 6. We also measured the effects of the
three individual steps in isolation, and the only note-
worthy result is that SentiStrength, when subjected
to our ?extra? preprocessing, benefits slightly from
slang normalization for the Qantas corpus, and from

noise cleaning for some parts of the Sanders corpus.
5 Qualitative evaluation
Having computed the success rates, we then per-
formed a small qualitative evaluation: What are the
main reasons for the misclassifications on tweets? In
addition, we wanted to know why the Qantas corpus
yielded much worse results than the Sanders corpus,
and thus we looked into its results.
5.1 Problems for SO-CAL
We chose SO-CAL?s judgements as the basis for this
evaluation and randomly selected 120 tweets from
the Sanders corpus that were not correctly classi-
fied. The distribution across the manual annotations
pos/neg/neut was 40/40/40.
In Table 4, we provide a classification of the rea-
sons for problems. The first group are cases where
we would not agree with the annotation and thus
cannot blame SO-CAL. The second group includes
problems that are beyond the scope of the system
and hence, strictly speaking, not its fault. Among the
typos, there are cases of misspelled opinion words,
but also a few where the typo leads to problems with
SO-CALs linguistic analysis and in consequence to
a misclassification. The slang words include items
like ?wow!? but also shorthands such as ?thx?. Most
important are ?domain formulae?: expressions that
require inferences in order to identify the sentiment.
An example is ?I now use X instead of TARGET?.
We encounter these most often in negative tweets,
where complaints are expressed, as in ?My phone
can send but not receive texts.?
In the third group, we find problems that are or
could be in the scope of SO-CAL. Occasionally,
negation or irrealis rules misfire. Gaps in the lex-
icon are noticeable especially on the positive side
(examples: ?loving?, ?better?, ?thanks to?). ?Lex-
ical ambiguity? refers to words that may or may
not carry polarity; by far the most frequent example
here is ?new?, which SO-CAL labels positive, but in
technology-related tweets often is neutral. Also in
neutral tweets, we often find high complexity, i.e.,
cases where both positive and negative judgements
are mixed. And finally, a fair number of problems
stems from sentiment expressed on the wrong target
of the tweet.

5.2 Observations on the Qantas corpus
The analysis of 75 Qantas tweets that have been mis-
classified by both SentiStength and SO-CAL yielded
the results in Table 5: Again, many annotation cases
are ambiguous, and domain formulae are the ma-
jor problem with negative tweets. Sarcasm is much
more frequent than in the Sanders corpus. The cen-
tral problem for neutral tweets stems from the fact
that spam and tweets containing headlines and URLs
of news messages have been annotated as neutral,
but these may very well contain polarity-bearing
words, which are then detected by the systems.
6 Interpretation and Conlusions
News versus tweets. Since the Sanders corpus is
much larger than Qantas, we regard it as the tweet
representative for the comparison to MPQA (a dif-
ficult data set, as argued above). For positive text,
both SentiStrength and SO-CAL yield better re-
sults on tweets, while for negative texts, the results
on tweets are much lower than on news sentences.
Within the news genre, however, both systems per-
form much better on negative than on positive text.
So we conclude a ?polarity flip? in the performance
of both systems when going from news to tweets.
Differences among tweets. Based on the Sanders
corpus, the SentiStrength and SO-CAL results are
a little better than those reported by (Mukherjee et
al., 2012), who achieved 56.17% accuracy for the
three-way classification. As SO-CAL does not in-
clude tweet-specific analysis, we may conclude that
the utility of such genre-specific measures is in fact
limited. ? An interesting question is why the ?Twit-
ter? subcorpus of Sanders behaves so different from
the others: While overall accuracy is the same, the
figures for the three categories differ widely. Also,
SO-CAL here benefits heavily from preprocessing
on the non-neutral tweets. One factor is the large
proportion of neutral tweets (see Table 1); besides,
we find that these tweets are not as target-related as
those for Apple, Google, Microsoft; it seems that
users often drop a ?#twitter? without actually talking
about Twitter or its service.
Preprocessing. Of the four measures taken by
SentiStrength to account for tweet problems (see
Sct. 1), SO-CAL already implements the exclama-
tion mark boost; the other three were added in our
own preprocessing, but we did only minimal spell-
checking. Overall, SO-CAL does not profit as much
as we had expected, but we find a fair improvement
(0.57?0.6) for the positive Sanders tweets. For neu-
tral tweets, performance actually decreases.
The role of targets An interesting observation is
that adding preprocessing to SO-CAL leads to de-
tecting ?more? sentiment: The average sentiment
values increase for all the corpora in Table 3. At the
same time, the accuracy on neutral tweets decreases,
which indicates that ?spurious? sentiment is being
detected. The most likely reason is that SO-CAL in-
deed profits from tweet-preprocessing but then de-
tects sentiment that is unrelated to the target and
therefore not annotated in the gold data. An im-
portant direction for future work therefore is to pay
more attention to target-specific sentiment identifi-
cation, cf. (Jiang et al, 2011).
