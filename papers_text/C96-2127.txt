Abstract 
We describe the development of a gen- 
erator for (\]erman built by reusing and 
adapting existing linguistic data and 
software. Reusability is crucial for the 
successful application of N I,P techniques 
to real-life problems ince it helps to cut 
down on both development and adap- 
tation effort. Itowever, combining re- 
sources not designed to work together 
is not trivial. We describe the prob- 
lems arising when integrating three pre- 
existing resources (FUF, a unification- 
based generator, an HPS(~ (\]ramrnm' 
for (~errnan, and X2MorF, 7~ two-level 
morphology (;omponent) and the adap- 
tat, ions necessary to come up with a wide 
coverage l;acticM generator for (\]erlnnn. 
1 Introduction 
A main obstacle for the successfifl application of 
N I,P is the necessary effort in terms of deve|op- 
inent and adaptation time. One possible answer 
to this problem is the use of generic and modu- 
la.r software. An example fbr a software system 
develot)e.d with this goal in mind is the FUF gen- 
erator (l~lhadnd, 1991), a well-documented pub- 
lic domain software written in IASI: ). Still, it is 
no straightforward task to employ that, kind of 
software for new applications. Another important 
step is the declarative definition of linguistic data 
(grammar and lexicon) which also fa(:ilit~tes reuse 
in another setting. The reuse of existing resources 
does not only save efforts but, to a hopeflflly much 
minor extent, also creates new tasks to be solved, 
i.e. the integration of resources not having been

designed to work together, llow this can be done 
in an organized way is the topic of this paper. 
The work being described here was done in t, he 
context of a multilinguM text generation system. 
One Of the ohjectives of the project is to rouse ex-- 
isting resources for those subtasks for which at> 
propriate resources exist, l,'or the German tactical 
generator 1 an irnph;mentation of an HPS(, '~ style 
gramrm~r of (\]erman (used for parsing and genre> 
ation, but on a different software platform) was 
available inhouse. ~l)he I"UI ? generator was chosen 
as the core component of t.he system. 
However, two problems had to be solved before 
FUI" could be used for the planned purpose. One 
was the Net that li'UF, dew, loped for English, has 
no suitM)le morphologicM conlponent for the rich 
inflection of German. X2MorF (Trost, 1991), an 
avMlahle morphologicM component had go be iH 
tegrated with the FUI e generator for this purpose. 
The other probh;m was that the existing HPS(L 
inspired gramrna.r of German could not be directly 
ported to the FUF formMisln. 
Before we describe the integration task we will 
briefly sketch the mMn characteristics of these 
resources, emphasizing those aspects which ei- 
ther cause problems lbr integration or provide the 
means for perfi)rrning the integration task.

2,1 The  FUF  Generator  
li'UF (Elhadad, 1991) is a surface generator for 
naturM language based on the theory of flmctional 
unification grammar (Kay, 1979). It employs both 
phrase structure rules and unification of feature 
descriptions. Input to I"U F is a partially speciiied 
feature description which constrains the utterance 
to be generated. Output is a flflly specified fea- 
ture description subsumed by the input struel,ure, 
which is then linearized to yiehl a sentence. 
1 Tit(: task of a tactical generator is to produce sen- 
tentbd or subsentential phrases corresponding to a se- 
mantic input specitication and does not include text 
planning.

until one I>ranch succeeds. Thus Cite inl>ut st;rue-

When unilieaCion aC the <:urren(, level is com-

l)liciCly given subsCruct, ur<'s only. E.g., \[,he de-

2.2 The HPSG Grammar  for German

1994), i,he fundamental  objects o\[' linguistic anM- 
ysis are signs modeled by typed fea(,ure strucLures 
and ('.onsCrMned by globM 1)rmciph;s. II I 'S(\] <lees 
uoC employ phrase strut'.Cure rules. Instead, very 
general dominance sc\]mmat, a are given. Which ar 
gmncn/,s a lexicM head takes is le?i(:ally sl)e<'iii(~d 
iu its SIII~CAT list. Also adjunction is st)ecili<M 
lexically; t,he ad.iuncC is seen as the semanl,ic head

3.1.1 The  Representat ion  of  Signs 
The process of recasting the original ITPS(\] 
structures in the FUF tbrmalism can best be de- 
scribed by exalnples. In Fig. 2 the htPS(\] repre- 
sentation of the German verb gem (walks) and it,s 
representation i  t?UF is shown, exemplifying the 
following mappings of HPS(\] onto FUF: 
? The subtyl)ing of the IIEAI) iS represented I)y 
the cat  feature of FUF. 
? SYNSEM),OCICA'rlHEAD is mapped to head. 
? SYNSEM\]LOCleONTbm, is mapped to concept.  
? Instead of subcategorizing for synsem wdues 
a.s proposed in Pollard and Sag (1994) the 
convention of Pollard and Sag (1987) to sub- 
categorize for signs is adopted. 
? Instead of a list-valued SUBCAT feature the 
feature args is used. The correspondence 
between (syntactic) arguments anti semantic 
roles is established by placing the constituent 
under a feature corresponding to its semantic 
role. Thus list manipulation is avoided and 
the structure corresponds more closely to the 
input specification (given in a language based 
on SPL (Kasper, 1989)). 
? The NONLocal feature is dropped. Slash ex- 
traction is handled differently. 
It should be noted that this entry does not col're- 
spond exactly to the actual representation i the 
generator, it serves simply to illustrate the basic 
ideas underlying the transformation. The actual 
implementation additionally allows for 
? the specification of arguments via externa l  
macros, accounting for a more principled 
treatment of case assignment, argument re- 
duction and slash extraction; 
? a ditferentiation between lexemes and stems 
to account for a treatment of inflection by the 
morphology component. 
The representation of phrasal signs in I IPSG par- 
allels the one of lexical signs; an additional feature 
DTR, S carries the subconstituents o\[" the phrase. 
One of the daughters is the head of the phrase 
(IIEAD-DTIt), its head features are identical to the 
head features of the phrase (llead Feature Prin- 
ciple). The other daughter may be either a corn- 
map between the lexieal representation of a word 
arm its surface fl)rm. Morphology proper on the 
other hand is viewed as a sirnpte concatenation 
process governed by a regular grammar. 
X2MorF augmertts standard two-lewJ mor- 
phology in two ways. First, it replaces the 
contimmtion class mechanism with a feature- 
based word grammar and lexicon. This is 
an important prerequisite for its use in a 
\[hature-based sentence-level processing system 
(see Trost and Matiasek (1994)). Second, it al- 
lows for interaction between two-level rules and 
word grammar facilitating the formulation of rules 
for non-concatenative morphol.actics like umlaut. 
3 The Integration Task 
Although the main components to be integrated 
fulfill reusability requirements (FU F being a fairly 
general and modular generation engine, the HPSG 
grammar being a declaratively written resource), 
integration of these resources into a unified sys- 
tem couhl only be achieved after suitable adap- 
tation. The morphological component of FUF is 
very restricted. Thus it needed to be replaced by 
X2MorF. The available German word level gram- 
mar of X2MorF was rewritten to conform to the 
feature structure notation employed by FUF. The 
two-hwel part stayed unchanged. More substan- 
|ial changes were required to adapt the HPSG 
granLmar. Not only syntactic adaptations to an- 
other feature formalism were needed, but also the 
olmrational characteristics of' FUF had to be ac- 
counted for. Also some of the phrase structure 
information generalized in the form of principles 
could be "compiled" into phrase structure rules. 
3.1 HPSG in FUF 
First experiments to implement ItPSG in FUF 
rather directly showed inetficient runtime behav- 
ior. Since most grammatical constraints in I IPSG 
are expressed via structure sharing, and FUF 
uses pointers to indicate coreferences, most of the 
processing time was spent in following pointer 
chains through deeply nested feature structures. 
Thus the structures have considerably been fiat- 
tened and some aspects (most notably SUBCAT 
and CONTent) have beet, encoded differently.

ment reduction (i.e. passivization) has to be per- 
formed or not (for a theoretical background see 
Heinz and Matiasek (1994)). In active contexts it 
becomes the subject and receives nominative case, 
in passive contexts it may be optionally realized 
as a PPvon (see Fig.6).

Figure 6: Expansion of #(externa l  np -ext -da)  
A mechanism common to all arguments and 
thus incorporated into every macro expanding to 
an argument specification is the extraction mech- 
anism required to handle movement (see Fig. 7). 
At the phrasal level the argument which has to 
( ; ;  try to fill slash by unification 
(({^ <slot>} ?^ slash})) 
;; does not unify --> add pattern 
(({^ pattern} (... <slot> ...)))))) 
Figure 7: Slash extraction (slightly simplified) 
be extracted (e.g., in wh-questions the constituent 
asked for) has to be specified as tire s lash  fea- 
ture of the args.  Each argument must be checked 
during generation if it is unifiable with the s lash  
specification, and, if so, it has to be made coref 
erential with s lash.  Otherwise, an appropriate 
pat tern  feature has to be produced to ensure the 
realization of the argument at the args level. 
3.1.5 V2 and  a Generat ion  Example  
(\]erman is commonly regarded as an SOV lan- 
guage. However, the standard word order - a sen- 
tence final verbal complex with the finite verb as 
the last dement - is encountered only in subor- 
dinate clauses. In declarative sentences and wh- 
questions the finite element of the verbal complex 
occupies the second position in the sentence. Sen- 
tence initial position of the finite verb is encoun- 
tered in imperative clauses and yes-no questions. 
In our grammar, the verbal complex is always 
generated in the standard order. To account 
for VI and V2 phenomena, a mechanism resem- 
bling the GB notion of head movement is imple- 
( (cat  s) 
(s - type dec la ra t ive)  
(head-dt r ( (cat  vk) 
(head ((vform fin))) 
(head-slash ((cat lex-verb))))) 
(v2 {^ head-dtr head-slash}) 
(subj ((head ((case hem) 
(num {^ ^  ^ head hum}) 
(pers {^ ^ ^ head pers}) ) ) ) i  
(args ((subj {^ sub j}) ) )  
;; force extraction of one constituent 
(alt (((focus GIVEg) 
(focus {^ args slash})) 
( ( focus {- subj}) 
(subj {^ args slash})))) 
(cset (head-dtr ) )  
(pat tern  (focus v2 args head-dt r ) ) )  
Figure 8: Declarative Main Clause in FUF 
mented. This mechanism flmctions analogously 
to the slash mechanism presented above. If a fea- 
ture head-s lash  is passed to the verbal temple: ,  
the finite verb is extracted, allowing the govern- 
ing phrase to realize it in first or second position. 
The morphology component ensures that separa- 
ble prefixes are left, in place. 
The vert)al complex is generated top down. 'l'he 
arguments of the main verb are generated lexicon 
driven, once the lexical head of the phrase has 
been established. 
Subject-verb agreement and nominative case as- 
signment is handled via the subj slot which is 
coreferential with args :  subj and - after argu- 
ment generation -conta ins the subject of the sen- 
tence (of. Fig. 6). Verb second position (:an only 
be ensltred, if the constituent in sentence initial 
l)osition is nonempty. The slot focus is designed 
to hold that constituent. The constituent o be 
topicalized or, if not specified in the input, the 
subj is extracte<t via the slash mechanism (cf. 
Fig. 7). The interaction between top down cat- 
egory driven and "bottom up" lexicon driven pro- 
cessing is illustrated in Fig. 9, showing also the 
effects of the two slash extraction mechanisms.

3.2 X2MorF  in FUF  
For the integration of X2MorF into I:UF the uni- 
fication engine used in X2MorF was replaced by 
I"UF itself, and the existing word grammar and 
~norph h;xieon were reformulated in the FUF for- 
laalism, and tim word form g('neration l, ask is 
now 1)erfontwd l)y FUI" itself. The= two-level rules 
could be taken over in l, heir original form, only l.he 
morl)hologieal tillers had to l)e l, ranstaLed. 
A simph" functor/argumenL scheme is suflicient 
for the word grammar.  The possible eombina- 
l,ions are given I/y the phrase structure rules of l.he 
morl)h grammar.  '\['he affixes (fun('t.ors) may fllr- 
the.r restrict the arguments they may lie applied 
t,o. Fig. 10 shows an examph; of morphoh/gical 
e;Ltegorics reslIonsible \[br nominal inlh;ction. A 
u(mn stem has to be \[bllowe.<l by a case suffix which 
determines ease and number ()\[' the resulting noun 
form. 'l'he, head features of the argumen\[, are made 
availal)le t,o the functor via the arghead feature, 
thus <'aiM)ling the funcl, or \[,o subcateg<)rize for its 
argumenl; (e.g., by re(luiriug a certain inflection 
\[>ara.digm). ()he of tim l)ossible case suffixes is a 
troll morl)h inducing l)lural in a certain (;lass of 
nouns with (noun-paradigm null). I t  applies in 
all cases ex(:el)L dative 3 setting the umlaut  feature, 
which U:iggers the two level rule forcing umlaut. 
An example is "(larleu," with plural "G:irlen".
