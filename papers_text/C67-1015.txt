ABSTRACT Two methods  are  g iven for conver t ing  rammars  be-  
longing to d i f fe rent  sys tems.  One conver ts  a s~mple  (context - f ree)  
phrase  s t ruc ture  grammar  (SPG) into a cor respond ing  dependency  
grammar  (DG); the other  conver ts  a DG into a cor respond ing  SPG. 
The s t ruc tures  ass igned  to a s t r ing  by a source  grammar  wi l l  cor -  
respond sys temat ica l ly ,  though asymmetr i ca l ly ,  to those ass igned  
by the ta rget  g rammar  resu l t ing  f rom its convers ion .  Since both 
sys tems are  wea ldy  equiva lent ,  generat ing  exact ly  the CF  lan -  
guages,  the methods  fac i l i ta te  exper imentat ion  with e i ther  notat ion  
in  dev is ing  ru les  for any CF  language or any CF  set  of s t r ings  de-  
s igned to undergo  subsequent  t rans format ion .  
A source  SPG is assumed to be of ' f in i te  degree with o r -  
dered  ru les  in which  only the in i t ia l  symbo l  is recurs ive .  Un less  
the source  grammars  obey add i t iona l  const ra in ts ,  the ta rget  g ram-  
mars  may exhib i t  a pecu l ia r  p roper ty ,  def ined as "s t ruc ture  sens i -  
t iv i ty" .  The l ingu is t i c  imp l i ca t ions  of the proper ty  a re  d i scussed ,  
and the l ingu is t i c  mot ivat ion  for impos ing  the const ra in ts  necessary  
to avo id  i ts  appearance  is suggested.  
The author  owes an espec ia l  debt to Jesse  Wr ight  of the Automata  
Theory  and Computab i l i ty  Group in  the Mathemat ica l  Sc ience De-  
par tment  of IBM Research  for  many helpful  discussior~s of theore -  
t i ca l  p rob lems ar i s ing  in the course  of this  invest igat ion .  
In an article on dependency theory i appearing in 1964 \[5\], 
Hays remarked, "Casual examination suggests there would be lit- 
tle d i f fe rence  between t rans format ion  of dependency  t rees  and 
t rans format ion  of IC \ [ immediate  const i tuent \ ]  s t ruc tures ,  but no 
def in i te  invest igat ion  has been under taken . "  S ince then, a depen-  
dency grammar  with t rans format iona l  ru les  has been des igned  for  
a subset  of Eng l i sh  sentences ,  and pre l iminary  resu l t s  ind icate  
that Hays '  observat ion  is cor rec t .  \[9\] In e i ther  case ,  t rans forma-  
t ions a re  spec i f ied  in te rms of labe led  t rees ,  and the number  of 
b ranches  and the denotat ions  of the labe ls  do not a f fec t  the essen-  
t ia l  operat ion .  S ince the base  grammar  is genera l ly  l im i ted  to the 
generat ion  of context - f ree  pro - te rmina l  s t r ings  of "deep  s t ruc -  
tu re" ,  and s ince  context - f ree  languages  are  character i zab le  in 
e i ther  dependency  or  phrase  s t ruc ture  ( i .e. ,  immedia te  const i tu -  
ent} sys tems,  ne i ther  sys tem is c lear ly  p re ferab le  as a base .  A 
l ingu is t  may  f ind that the notat ion  a f fo rded  by one or the o ther  is 
s imp ler  for  character i z ing  some language,  or fo r  def in ing s t ruc -  
tu res  to be t rans formed,  or for  adapt ing a grammar  to computer  
app l i ca t ions .  A l ingu is t  may  a l so  w ish  to exper iment  w i th  gram-  
mars  of both types,  or redes ign  t rans format ions  def ined on the 
s t ruc tures  of one base  grammar  in o rder  to incorporate  them into 
a t rans format iona l  g rammar  us ing a d i f fe rent  base.  
Such cons iderat ions  as these  mot ivate  the present  t reat -  
ment  of the prob lem of obta in ing pa i red  grammars  by conver t ing  a 
grammar  of one k ind into a sys temat ica l ly  cor respond ing  grammar  
of the o ther  wh ich  generates  the same sentences  and ass igns  com-  
parab le  s t ruc tures .  In addit ion,  convers ion  draws  a t tent ion  to 
some l ingu is t i ca l l y  s ign i f i cant  re la t ionsh ips  that may ex is t  unno-  
t i ced  among the categor ies  and ru les  of the source  grammar  and 
wh ich  may induce in the der ived  grammar  a pecu l ia r  p roper ty  of 
s t ruc ture  sens i t i v i ty ,  rough ly  ana logous  to context  sens i t i v i ty .  
This  p roper ty  w i l l  be exh ib i ted  and d i scussed  in the course  of i l -

We begin  concrete ly  by inspect ing  (F ig.  i)  a pa i r  of g ram-

of the kind formalized by Chomsky  \[2\], Bar-Hillel \[i\] , and others, 
and DGI,  a dependency grammar  of the kind formalized by Gaif- 
man{4\ ]  and Hays \[5\] . Two structural diagrams, a P-tree and a 
D-tree drawn beneath the grammars ,  illustrate the structure each 
assigns.

thereby  increas ing  the  resemblance  of SPGi  to  DGi  in  an  obv ious  
way .  Th is  i s  poss ib le  because  SPGt  does  not  conta in  any  mixed  
rewr i t ing  ru les  in  wh ich  both  categor ies  and  lex ica l  fo rmat ives  ap-  
pear  on the  r ight .  I t  can  be  shown that  any  SPG wh ich  has  mixed  
ru les ,  in  th i s  sense ,  can  be conver ted  in to  one  wh ich  does  not  
mere ly  by in t roduc ing  new categor ies ,  w i thout  a f fec t ing  generat ive  
power .  Thus  there  is  no reason  fo r  not  separat ing  the  two types  of 
ru les ,  and  Chomsky~devotes  a good  par t  of  Aspects  of  the  Theory  
o_ff Syntax  \[3\] to g iv ing  l ingu is t i c  reasons  fo r  jus t  such  a separat ion .  
Hereaf ter ,  " rewr i t ing  ru les"  w i l l  re fe r  on ly  to those  l i ke  
ru les  i -3  in  SPGi ,  and  those  l i ke  ru les  4 -9  Wi l l  be  ca l led  "ass ign-  
ment  ru les" .  Categor ies  wh ich  do not  appear  on  the  le f t  of any  re -  
wr i t ing  ru les  a re  te rmina l  ca tegor ies .  
Wi th  each  category  of SPGi ,  we assoc ia te  a number  ca l led  
i t s  degree .  {To say  that  a category  i s  of degree  n means  that  n 
i s  the  f i xed  upper  l im i t  to the  number  of nodes  of the  shor tes t  path  
lead ing  f rom i t  to a te rmina l  ca tegory  in  any  s t ructure  der ived  
f rom St by success ive  ru le  app l i ca t ions .  A category  may be  of in -  
f in i te  degree .  For  example ,  i f  X ~ XX, then  X i s  of in f in i te  de -  
g ree  and  so  i s  the  grammar  in  wh ich  i t  occurs  even  though another  
ru le  rewr i tes  X as  a s t r ing  conta in ing  on ly  te rmina l  ca tegor ies . )  i 
In  SPGt  the te rmina l  ca tegor ies  D, N, V a re  of  zero  degree ,  s ince  
they  are  not  rewr i t ten ;  the  categor ies  NP  and  VP  are  of degree  i ,  
s ince  a t  leas t  one category  in  the i r  rep lacement  is  of zero  degree ;  
and  the  degree  of S i s  2, s ince  the leas t  degree  ass igned to any  
category  on  the  r ight  of  the  ru le  fo r  rewr i t ing  S i s  i .  The  max i -  
mum number  ass igned to any  category  in  a grammar  i s  a l so  the  
degree  of the  grammar ;  there fore ,  the  degree  of SPGi  is  2. 
An  essent ia l  d i f fe rence  between SPGi  and  DGi  now emerges  
more  c lear ly .  DGi  uses  on ly  te rmina l  ca tegor ies ,  wh i le  SPGi  
uses  categor ies  of  h igher  degree .  The  e f fec ts  of the  d i f fe rences  
are  re f lec ted  in  the  s t ructure  of the  P - t ree  and  D- t ree .  The  la t te r  
has  fewer  branches ,  and  th i s  w i l l  a lways  be  the  case  fo r  s t ruc tures  
ass igned to the  same s t r ing  by grammars  be long ing  to the  two d i f -  
fe rent  sys tems.  
Even  so, there  is  a sys temat ic  cor respondence  between the  
two t rees  and  the i r  labe ls  of a k ind  de f ined  by  Hays  \[5\] . Every  
complete  subt ree  of  the  D- t ree ,  that  i s ,  every  node  taken  together  
w i th  a l l  of i t s  descendents ,  covers  a subst r ing  of the  sentence  that  
is  covered  by  a complete  subt ree  of the  P - t ree .  The  conver ,  se  
does  not  ho ld ,  but  every  complete  subt ree  of  the  P - t ree  covers  a 
subst r ing  that  i s  covered  by a connected  subt ree  of the  D- t ree .  In

the example, both complete subtrees dominated by N in the D-tree 
correspond to the two complete subt~ees of the P-tree dominated 
by NP, and the complete (sub)tree dominated by V corresponds to 
the complete (sub)tree dominated by S. However, the complete 
subtree dominated by Vlo in the lo-tree corresponds to an incom- 
plete subt ree  of the D- t ree ,  which  is dominated  by V but inc ludes  
only V and the branches  to i ts r ight ;  so that the re la t ionsh ip  of cor -  
respondence  is asymmetr i ca l .  
Whi le such sys temat ic  cor respondences  ex is t  between the 
s t ruc tures  ass igned  to a l l  s t r ings  generated  by SloGi and DGi ,  this 
is  not the genera l  case.  In genera l .  ~

e i ther  s imp le  phrase  s t ruc ture  or  dependency sys tems.  
2. For  any g iven  SPG, there  ex is ts  one or  more  DG over  the 
same language al l  of whose s t ruc tures  cor respond sys temat i -  
ca l ly  to s t ruc tures  ass igned  to the same s t r ings  by the SPG if  
and only i f  the SPG is of f in i te degree .  
3. For  any g iven DG there  ex is ts  one or more  cor respond ing  SloG. 
4. For  any g iven  DG there  ex is ts  a unique SPG of degree  i that is 
s t rong ly  equ iva lent  o it. 
Ga i fman \[4\] g ives  a very  genera l  method  for  const ruc t ing  
cor respond ing  DG f rom any SloG of f in i te degree ,  and a l so  a meth-  
od for  const ruc t ing  a unique SloG of degree  t f rom any DG. Here  
we give two methods  for  const ruc t ing  cor respond ing  Slog and DG 
that d i f fer  f rom Ga i fman 's .  The f i r s t  app l ies  only to a more  re -  
s t r i c ted  set  of SI?G and leads  to reduced  DG, whereas  Ga~fman's  
method  tends to produce  DG with over lapp ing  categor ies  and super -  
f luous ru les  that may never  be used  to generate  any st r ing.  The 
second a l lows const ruc t ion  of SPG of degree  greater  than i f rom 
cer ta in  DG. 2 
A simplified sketch of the two methods follows. Each re- 
writing rule is "augmented" by starring a category on the right. 
Each dependency rule is augmented by assigning a numerical coef- 
ficient to each dependent. Figure 2 shows a possible augmented 
lloroofs are given by Gai fman \[4\]. It is assumed that the Slog is 
non-erasing and reduced; that is, no category is rewritten as null, 
and there are no superfluous categories or rules. 
2The second method was suggested by Kay's procedurefor con- 
structing lo-trees f rom D-trees \[7\]. More  precisely, an Slog of 
degree n > i may  be derived if, in the DG, some categories 
govern two or more  dependents, and the left- or rightmost depen= 
dent itself governs dependents.

the right. (Detailed consideration of the prob lem of augmentation 
@ill follow the sketch of the operations.) These augmentations 
were  deliberately chosen so that conversion of either g rammar  
uniquely produces the other. Different augmentations produce dif- 
ferent results, although structures of the original g rammar  and of 
the grammar  der ived  f rom it  s t i l l  co r respond.

F igure  2 
The co lumns TS and IRL in F igure  2 represent  a Table  of 
Subst i tutes  and an In termed ia te  Rule L is t .  In the convers ion  of 
SPGi ,  the TS is const ruc ted ,  equat ing each category  on the left  of 
a ru le  with a superscr ip ted  te rmina l  ca tegory .  The numer ica l  
superscr ip t  {hereaf ter  ca l led  the exponent) equals  the number  of 
ru les  t raced  through when t rac ing  by s ta r red  categor ies  be fore  a 
s ta r red  te rmina l  ca tegory  is  reached,  and expresses  the d is tance  
between the te rmina l  ca tegory  and the category  for  which  i t  is a 
subst i tute.  In the IRL, the categor ies  occur r ing  in each ru le  of the 
SPG are  rep laced  by the i r  subst i tu tes  f rom TS. Tak ing the f i r s t  
LRL ru le ,  const ruc t ion  of a dependency ru le  is  begun by rep lac ing  
the ar row with parentheses  enc los ing  the subst i tute  categor ies  on 
the r ight.  Thus f rom the f i r s t  IRL  ru le  in F igure  2 we obtain 
V 2 (Ni V~). The construction of a dependency rule is continued 
so long as the exponent of the starred category X~ is greater than 
zero. The next step is to search the IRL  for a rule with X s on the 
left. The categories on the right of the new rule are inserted in 
the parentheses of the D rule under construction, in the position 
of X~, but no new parentheses are added. When the starred oc- 
currence is X~, it is replaced by *, all exponents are erased, and 
the dependency ru le  is complete .  The process  is  repeated  for  new 
dependency ru les  unti l  a l l  IRL  ru les  a re  exhausted.  
We must  add rules to the constructed DG for any unstarred 
terminal category of the IRL. The added rules assign no depen- 
dents and are of the form D(*). The assignment rules are simply 
t rans fer red ,  and s ince V is the subst i tute  for  the ax iom category  
S, it  is taken as the ax iom for  the DG. 
Going in the other direction f rom an augmented DGI  to 
SI : 'Gt ,  we f i r s t  ass ign  an  exponent  s to each  category ,  where  s 
equa ls  the  la rgest  coe f f i c ient  of any  dependent  of that  category .  I f  
a category  is  not  ass igned dependents ,  i t s  exponent  i s  zero .  The  
f i r s t  ru le  of augmented  DGt  now appears  as  V z (ZN 1 * 1Nt ) .  
F rom th is  ru le  two  ru les  a re  const ructed  fo r  the  IRL ;  that  i s ,  the  
number  of IRL  ru les  const ructed  f rom each  ru le  of DGt  w i l l  be  
equa l  to  the  exponent  of the  governor .  The  f i r s t  ru le  so obta ined  
wr i tes  the  governor  w i th  i t s  exponent  on  the  le f t  of the  ar row.  A l l  
of i t s  dependents  whose  coef f i c ients  equa l  that  of the  exponent  a re  
wr i t ten  in  o rder  on  the  r ight ,  and  the  govern ing  category  w i th  i t s  
exponent  decreased  by  t i s  wr i t ten  w i th  the  *. Thus  we obta in  
V z ~ N 1 Vt . .  The  second ru le  is  obta ined  in  a s imi la r  fash ion ,  
w i th  the  exponent  of the  govern ing  category  d imin ished  by 1 y ie ld -  
ing  V t -~ V0 N1. ' The  process  is  repeated  unt i l  an  IRL  ru le  re -  
wr i t ing  some category  w i th  exponent  equa l  to 1 is  used ,  a f te r  wh ich  
the  next  DG ru le  is  p rocessed ,  and  so  on  unt i l  a l l  DG ru les  a re  
exhausted .  
A t  th i s  po in t ,  the  * ' s  may be  erased  and,  except  fo r  cate -  
gory  labe ls ,  the  IRL  i s  exact ly  equ iva lent  to the  rewr i t ing  ru les  of 
the  or ig ina l  unaugmented  SPG.  The  on ly  funct ion  the  TS serves  i s  
to  reass ign  labe ls .  Ass ignment  ru les  a re  t rans fer red  and  the  sub-  
s t i tu te  fo r  the  ax iom of DGt  i s  added,  t 
SPGI  and DG1 are very simple, with no embeddings and no 
optional rules. More  complicated grammars  give rise to problems 
of augmentation, especially for SPG. Even  SPGI  poses a problem. 
Assume it had been augmented  by starring NP  in rule I and in rule 
Z. In that case, the same substitute, N Z, is assigned to both S 
and VP, and the procedure produces a DG that is not even weakly 
equivalent to the original. Clearly some constraints must  be im- 
posed on augmentation and provision made for g rammars  in which 
it may not be possible to avoid starring a category more  than once. 
S imi la r ly ,  assume that  some DG has  a ru le  of the  fo rm 
C (A B * D), and  that  th i s  i s  augmented  as  C ( tA  Z\]3 * tD) .  The  
IRL  rules are: 
C z --, B C $ 
C 1 ~ A C O D. 
But  now the  ru les  generate  the  sequence  \]3 A C D, wh ich  was  not  
generated  by  the  or ig ina l  ru le ,  and  do not  generate  A B C D, wh ich  
was .  Th is  i s  remedied  by requ i r ing  that  i f  a coe f f i c ient  n has  been 
ass igned to  a dependent ,  no  h igher  number  i s  ass igned to any  de-  
pendent  wh ich  in tervenes  between i t  and  the  *. We w i l l  a l so  re -  
qu i re  that  a t  leas t  one dependent  be  preceded by  t ,  and  if  any  de-  
pendent  i s  p receded by n > t ,  there  must  be  a t  leas t  one dependent  
1A l though grammars  w i th  on ly  one  ax iom are  i l l us t ra ted ,  g ram-  
mars  w i th  more  than  one  ax iom can  obv ious ly  be  hand led  as  we l l .  
preceded by n - i .  Th is  is  not  c ruc ia l ,  but  i t  avo ids  set t ing  up un-  
necessary ,  s ing le -branch ing  categor ies  in  the  der ived  $PG.  Note  
that  i f  a l l  dependents  in  any  ru le  a re  preceded by  i ,  wh ich  i s  the  
same as  not  augment ing  the DG at  a l l ,  the  resu l t ing  SPG wi l l  be  of 
degree  i ;  that  i s ,  each  ru le  of the  grammar  w i l l  conta in  a t  leas t  
one te rmina l  ca tegory  on the  r ight .  Th is  i s  equ iva lent  to Ga i fman 's  
procedure \[4\]. 
Augmentat ion  of SPG is the more  difficult case. Pr imar i ly  
it is the prob lem of constructing the TS in a finite number  of steps. 
For  ex~mple, if for S --- NP  VP  S the S is starred on the right, 
an infinite loop is created immediately. This is easy to avoid 
when considering a single rule or a smal l  set of rules, but we  do 
not know in general whether some series of rule augmentat ions 
may not lead to the same situation. Gai fman's  solution is to re- 
quire that the marked  category be of lesser degree than the cate- 
gory on the left, but this not only leads to a proliferation of cate- 
gories in the derived DG whenever  the SPG has more  than one re- 
writing rule for any of its categories, it prevents us f rom deriving 
the simplest corresponding DG in some cases. I On  the other hand, 
the method employed here will not work  unless some restrictions 
are imposed on augmentat ion wh ich  also imply restrictions on the 
fo rm of the SPG in addition to the requi rement  of finite degree. It 
is not clear what  restrictions are min imal ly  necessary, but it is 
sufficient to require, in addition to finiteness of degree, that the 
rules of the SPG be ordered, so that in a developing derivation, if 
rule n has been applied, no rule m,  m < n, need be applied there- 
after. This is too restrictive, and does not allow for full recur- 
sion. We may,  however,  allow a dummy symbol, S', to appear in 
any rule rewriting some X as a string containing some Y, 
S' ~ Y ~ X, where  S' is replaced after one application of the set of 
rules by # S #, the axiom, so that the rules then reapply in linear 
order. 
Any  $PG of finite degree with ordered rules providing for 
recursive application in the manner  specified can be converted to a 
corresponding DG by the method given here. The  base component  
proposed by 2Chomsky \[3\] for transformational g rammar  is an SPG 
of this form. 
l"Simplest" with respect to process, number  of categories, and 
f reedom f rom the property of structure sensitivity. See p. 14 ff. 
2Chomsky  does not explicitly require that if S' appears in rewriting 
X, some Y (S' ~ Y ~ X) appear in the rule also, but implicitly ob- 
serves the restriction. A new grammar  for English by Rosenbaum 
\[10\] contains a rule NP  ~ NP  S' which does not observe it. This 
is the only case known to me of an actual g rammar  for some 
!'real" language that violates this restriction, and Rosenbaum does 
not claim any strong theoretical motivation for the rule in-question. 
Cf. also Lees  \[8\], and the MITRE grammar  \[11\]. 
We turn now to more  detailed consideration of augmenting 
and converting SPG subject to the above constraints. While the 
constraints insure that the SPG can be workably converted, some 
linguistically significant problems arise if we  consider how to de- 
rive a simple DG, and it will be shown that under some conditions 
the derived DG will exhibit a feature not heretofore considered in 
the  l i te ra ture ,  a feature  of  "s t ruc ture  sens i t i v i ty" .

ZSince the  SPG must  be f in i te ,  no ru le  w i l l  rewr i te  X as  a s t r ing

I f  the  s imples t  DG cor respond ing  to the  SPG i s  des i red ,  
then  i t  i s  p re ferab le  to augment  the SPG in  such  a way  that  
a)  no  category  occurs  both  s tar red  and  non-s tar red  on  the  
r ight ,  and  
b) no  category  is  s ta r red  on  the r ight  of two or  more  ru les  
wh ich  rewr i te  d i f fe rent  categor ies .  
But  i t  i s  not  a lways  poss ib le  to observe  these  po l i c ies ,  and  in  
that case ,  add i t iona l  augmentat ion  is necessary  in order to 
d is t ingu ish  among occur rences  of X as  the  marked  const i tuent  
in  the  ru le  rewr i t ing  Y, X as  the  marked  const i tuent  in  the  
ru le  rewr i t ing  Z, Z ~ Y, and  X as  an  unmarked  const i tuent  
of any  category .  
Assume some category X is starred in two or more  rules 
wh ich  rewrite different categories, 1 say Y and Z, and also 
occurs unstarred on the right in some rules. The two X*'s 
are assigned different subscripts to avoid assigning the same 
substitutes for Y and Z with the consequent loss of essential 
information. We now have three varieties of X, namely:  X, 
XI, and X2, where  X is the unstarred variety, X I is the 
marked  constituent of Y, and X 2 of Z. (If X does not occur 
unstarred, only X and X I are needed.) If X is not a termi-  
nal category, there is a rule rewriting X. Then  we must  add, 
beneath that rule, rules for rewriting X 1 and X 2. If 
X ~ U*  W, we  add X I ~ U I*  W 
and X 2 -~ U2*  W. 
Now,  if U is not a terminal category, we  add rules for re- 
writing U I and U 2 beneath the rule rewriting U. Thus  the 
process of adding rules is iterative, but it will eventually end 
when, in some lower rule, a terminal category is starred. 
Note that in some cases sub-subscripts are needed. For  
example  : 
I .  Z . . . .  P I * "  " " 
2. X . . . .  R I * . . .

If we  interpret each distinct X n as a separate category, 
then the same list of words is assigned to the three catego- 
ries, N, Nf, and NZ, by the assignment rules. If we  inter- 
pret them as the same category, then the subscripts distin- 
guish the different substructures of a sentence in which the 
N's occur. Each  N governs a D directly on the left, but if 
it is the ax iom it is required to govern another N on the right 
also. If N is not the ax iom but is governed directly by the 
axiom, it ~ govern another N on the right, and is required 
to govern a V on the left. If it is neither the ax iom nor a di- 
rect dependent of the axiom, it governs nothing but the D. We 
may not erase the subscripts and write a single conflated rule 
N (iv\] D ? iN\]), for then strings not generated by SPGZ 
would be generated .  (For  example ,  the ru le  would generate  
an inf in i te  se t  of s t r ings ,  (D N)n.) In such c i rcumstances  we 
say that the DG is s t ruc ture  sens i t i ve .  
Definition i. A DG is structure sensitive if 
a. the set of terminals assigned to one category is identical 
to the set assigned to any other category, and/or 
b.  any rule restricts the choice of dependents a category 
may govern to a subset of the ordered dependents it is 
permitted to govern in some other rule. 
Note that a DG containing the rules A (*) and A (B ? C) is 
structure sensitive by this definition. Here, too, conflation is im- 
possible, s ince A (\[B\] ? \[C\]) a l lows A to govern  B without  gov-  
e rn ing  C. 
This  s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  feature  of some DG apparent ly  
serves  funct ions l lke those served  by the context -sens i t i ve  feature  
of context -sens i t i ve  phrase  s t ruc ture  grammars  in p lac ing res t r i c -  
t ions on the s t r ing  generated ,  but there  seems to be no ment ion  of 
i t  in the l i te ra ture .  I ts  character  may be masked  by the f reedom 
to set  up categor ies  and ass ign  the same termina ls  to them. i For  
example ,  one may subst i tute  s imp le  symbols  X and Y for  the 
complex  symbo ls  N i and N 2, and obtain the ru les  
X (D * Y) 
Y (V D ~' iN\])

iGa i f rnan 's  method  \[4\] for  conver t ing  SPG to DG makes  great  use 
of this f reedam.

In  th i s  case ,  on ly  the  ass ignment  ru les ,  ass ign ing  exact ly  the

b. any  rewr i t ing  ru le  does  not  conta in ,  on  the  r ight ,  a un ique  
category  (o ther  than  the  ax iom)  wh ich  occurs  on ly  once  in  
that  ru le  and  appears  on the r ight  in  no  o ther  ru le .  
The  l ingu is t i c  imp l i ca . t ions  of the  proper ty  may be c la r i f ied  
by  cons ider ing  two sets  of ru les ,  one  fo r  the  ar t i f i c ia l  l anguage 
a n b a n and  one fo r  a f ragment  of Eng l i sh .  
The  language a n b a n i s  generated  by  the  ru les  S ~-~ A S A,  
S ~ B, A ~ a, and  B ~ b. The  f i r s t  ru le  "does  not  conta in  a 
un ique  category  (o ther  than  the  ax iom)  wh ich  occurs  on ly  once" ,  
s ince  A occurs  tw ice .  One of the  A 's  must  be  s tar red  in  con-  
ver t ing  to a DG and the  DG wi l l  d i s t ingu ish  two categor ies  of a,  
a le f t  A and  a r ight  A. Note  that  the  same language i s  generated  
i f  the  f i r s t  ru le  i s  S ~ A S and  a t rans format iona l  ru le  
X B => X B X is  added.  In th i s  case ,  each  rewr i t ing  ru le  con-  
ta ins  a un ique  category  o ther  than  the  ax iom,  and  a s t ruc ture - f ree  
set  of dependency  ru les  is  obta inab le  f rom them.  
A less  a r t i f i c ia l  but  s t i l l  ex t reme case  of  s t ruc ture  sens i -  
t i v i ty  is  that  in  wh ich  two or  more  ru les  a re  rewr i t ten  in  exact ly  
the  same way.  Assume that  an  SPG fo r  Eng l i sh  has  the  fo l low ing

med ia te  dominat ion  of S, and  "ob jec t  of a verb"  re fers  to the  NP  
under  the  immediate  dominat ion  of  VP .  Chomsky  a l so  shows  that

for  sentences  l ike " John  was persuaded by Bi l l  to leave"  where  
" John"  is  s imu l taneous ly  ob jec t -o f  "persuade"  and sub jec t -o f  a 
t rans formed embedded sentence  " John  leave" ,  it  is  imposs ib le  to 
represent  such funct iona l  not ions by categor ia l  ass ignments ,  and 
adds that "Examples  of th is  sort ,  of course ,  p rov ide  the pr imary  
mot ivat ion  and empi r i ca l  jus t i f i ca t ion  for  the theory  of t rans for -

Whether  it  is poss ib le  or des i rab le  to requ i re  that SPG 
components  of t rans format iona l  g rammars  for  natura l  languages  
be s t ruc ture  f ree  is an open quest ion,  ib resumably ,  it  is  des i rab le  
if it is  poss ib le ,  s ince  the leas t  power fu l ,  most  res t r i c ted  gram-  
mar  - -  the t ightes t  f i t  - -  is to be pre fer red .  Moreover ,  inspec -  
t ion of p roposed  grammars ,  for  Eng l i sh  at least ,  ind icates  that 
most  of the i r  ru les  do conta in  unique categor ies  on the r ight.  
Return ing  now to SPG2, we see that it  is  s t ruc ture  f ree ,  
s ince  every  e lementary  rewr i t ing  ru le  for  every  category  X i con-  
ta ins  a s ing le  occur rence  of at leas t  one category  Yi on the r ight  
which  does not appear  e l sewhere  on the r ight ,  and is not the ax iom.  
Under  these  cond i t ions  we wi l l  say that Yi is a head for  ca tegory  
X i and ca l l  a l l  such Y 's  head categor ies .  Examinat ion  shows that 
the s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  proper ty  of DG2 arose  f rom the cho ices  
made in augment ing  SPG2. If only head categor ies  a re  marked ,  a 
s t ruc ture - f ree  DG s imi la r  to DGi  resu l t s ,  in which  a l l  s igns of 
augmentat ion  can be erased  without  a l te r ing  i ts generat ive  capaci ty .  
In tu i t ive ly ,  it seems reasonab le  to regard  heads  as sources  
of a "governor"  in any s t r ing  der ivab le  f rom the category  in whose 
rewr i t ing  ru les  they appear .  Th is  does not mean that the s t r ing  is  
to be cons idered  endocent r i c  in the s t rong  sense  of requ i r ing  that 
the governor  be subst i tu tab le  for  the ent i re  s t r ing  without  loss  of 
g rammat ica l i ty ,  and the ob ject ion  somet imes  ra i sed  that  dependen-  
cy theory  fo rces  a pure ly  endocent r i c  ana lys i s  of a language is 
based  on fa i lu re  to d i s t ingu ish  between "head  o.P' and "subst i tu tab le  
fo r " .  It appears  t ruer  to say that dependency ana lys i s  assumes  
that one phrase  type is d i s t ingu ished  f rom another  p r imar i l y  by the 
s ingu lar  p resence  of some category  in it  ra ther  than by co -occur -  
rence  and order  of ca tegor ies  in it. 
Inc identa l ly ,  as ide  f rom the prob lem of obtain ing a s t ruc -  
tu re - f ree  DG f rom an SPG, avo idance  of s t ruc ture  sens i t i v i ty  may 
be a c r i te r ion  for  ass ign ing  government  when one is ana lyz ing  a 
language in te rms of dependency  theory.  In Eng l i sh ,  fo r  example ,  
the cho ice  has genera l ly  wavered  between noun and verb  as cand i -  
dates  for  sentence  government .  S ince every  e lementary  sentence  
contains one verb  but may conta in  severa l  nouns,  choos ing the noun 
fo rces  a s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  DG. 
In conver t ing  a DG to  an  SPG, no requ i rement  of in t r ins ic  
t6  
order ing  needs  to be  imposed on  the  dependency  ru les ,  as  i t  was  
on  the  rewr i t ing  ru les  of SPG.  Dependency  ru les  may a lways  he  
par t ia l l y  o rdered  by  s tar t ing  w i th  the  ru le  (o r  ru les )  fo r  the  ax i -  
om(s ) .  Ca l l  these  " leve l  zero  ru les" .  Then  leve l  i ru les  a re  
those  wh ich  ass ign  dependents  to the  ax iom,  leve l  Z those  wh ich  
ass ign  dependents  to categor ies  wh ich  make the i r  f i r s t  appearance  
in  leve l  t ru les ,  and  so  on. To insure  eventua l  te rminat ion ,  how-  
ever ,  i t  i s  requ i red  that  i f  X occurs  anywhere  in  a leve l  n ru le ,  
and  i s  a dependent  in  a leve l  m ru le ,  m > n, then  i t s  cho ice  as  
? dependent  in  the  leve l  m ru le  i s  opt iona l  o r  e l se  the  governor  in  
the  leve l  m ru le  is  opt iona l ly  chosen  a t  some po in t .  Otherwise  
no  const ra in ts  on recurs ion  are  necessary ,  and  any  category  may 
be  i 'e in t roduced at  a lower  leve l .  
By cont ras t ,  the  prob lem of conf la t ion  ar i ses .  I t  has  been 
shown that rules like k (~) and A (B * C), occurring in structure- 
sensitive DG,  cannot be conflated. Conflations of A (B $) with 
A (C * D) and of A (~ B) with A (B *) are also impossible, al- 
though structure sensitivity as defined above is not involved. If 
the rules are not conflatable because the DG is structure sensitive, 
then the SPG may also be structure sensitive. If they are not con- 
flatable solely because of disparate number  or position Cleft or 
right) with respect to the governor, the SPGwi l l  be structure free. 
In either case, the conversion process becomes  somewhat  more  
complicated. 
The process  w i l l  be  i l l us t ra ted  f i r s t  by app ly ing  i t  to a DG 
whose  ru les  cannot  be fu l l y  conf la ted  both  because  some are  s t ruc -  
tu re  sens i t ive  and  because  some ass ign  d i sparate  numbers  o r  po -  
s i t ions  to dependents  of  a category .  
Method  2. Convers ion  of DG to SPG 
Step  t .  Augmentat ion  
Def in i t ion :  A dependent  e lement  in  a dependency  ru le  i s  any  
braced  or  b racketed  s t r ing  not  inc luded in  la rger  braces  or  
b rackets ,  ~nd any  s ing le  unbraced ,  unbracketed  occur rence  
o ther  than  ? occur r ing  w i th in  parentheses .  
E.g., in A ({BD\ [C \ ]}  * E \[F\]) there are three de- 
pendent elements: "{BD\[C\]'~ , E, and \[F\]. 
a. Precede each dependent element with a coefficient n > i, 
so that for any n > i, at least one element is preceded by 
n - I, and for any m > n, m does not intervene between 
n and ~. Thus:

C. 
d. 
A (ZB * IC) 
A (2B IC *) 
but not A (2B @ 2C) 
and not A ( iB  2C *). 
Ass ign  an exponent  s to the governor  in each  ru le ,  where  
s equals  the la rgest  coe f f i c ient  n of any dependeSt.  (For  
ru les  of the fo rm X (~), s is  zero . )  
I f  a ca tegory  X is  ass igned  d i f fe rent  exponents  for  d i f fe r -  
ent ru les  in which  it  occurs  as governor ,  assoc ia te  a d is -  
t inct  subscr ip t  with each  d is t inc t  exponent.  
Rep lace  every  occur rence  of X as dependent  by X s. If 
X has been  subscr ip ted ,  inc lude each var iant  in b races ,  
thus :

Step 2. Tes t  for  unmarked  (unprocessed)  ru les .  If none remain ,  
go to step 4. Otherw ise  take the f i r s t  unmarked  ru le ,  where  
some x~i  is governor  and set  a counter  S = s.. 
1 
Step 3. If S = 0, mark  the ru le  and repeat  step 2. If S ~ 0, con-  
s t ruc t 'a  ru le  of an In tErmed ia te  Rule L i s t  of the fo rm 
X~ . . . . .  On the r ight  of the ar row dupl icate a l l  dependent  
e lements  whose  coef f i c ients  n = S. Inc lude the $, and pre -  
cede it  wi th  ~- i .  Decrease  S by i ,  and repeat  step 3. 
Step 4. Es tab l i sh  a Table  of Subst i tutes ,  ass ign ing  a unique sym-  
bol to every  d is t inct  XSn i for  which S i ~ 0. 
Step 5. Ass ign  the subst i tute  or  subst i tu tes  for the ax ioms of the 
DG as ax ioms of the SPG. 
Step 6. Rewr i te  the IRL,  us ing subst i tu tes  f rom the TS, de let ing 
exponents  and subscr ip ts  f rom any X 0 and omi t t ing  ~. n '

SPG3 is s t ruc ture  sens i t i ve ,  s ince two categor ies ,  S and 
X, a re  rewr i t ten  the same way. This  resu l t s  f rom the fact  that, 
in  DG3, A has two sets  of dependents  and one set  is inc luded in the 
other .  The s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  ru les  for  C in DG3 produced  no 
addi t iona l  s t ruc ture -sens i t i ve  ru les  in SPG3, however ,  s ince one 
of them, C ($1, was not p rocessed  in step 3 and did not fo rm par t  
of the IRL.  
SPG3 may be rewr i t ten  as a s t ruc ture - f ree  grammar  in a 
pure ly  ad hoc way by e l im inat ing  the rewr i t ing  ru le  for  X and shb- 
st i tut ing S for  the occur rence  of X on the r ight.  More  genera l ly ,  
i t  is reasonab le  to requ i re  of the or ig ina l  DG that i ts  ru les  be de-  
s igned so that it is poss ib le  to wr i te  a s ingle  ru le  (schema} as -  
s igning dependents  to any g iven category .  This  requ i rement  is 
reasonab le  if the DG is a base  component  of a t rans format iona l  
g rammar  whose t rans format ions  take care  of the eventua l  o rder  of 
e lements  in a sentence .  The pr imary  funct ion of the DO's  depen-  
dency ru les  is ,  in this case,  only that of l i s t ing ' co -occur r ing  cate -  
gor ies  in the dependency re la t ions  in some canonica l  o rder .  In 
DO3, A a lways  occurs  with B as dependent.  Whenever  E is a 
dependent  of A, then e i ther  a second B or a C a re  a lso  depen-  
dents,  and if  a second B is  a dependent  of A, D is  a lso .  This set  
of condit ions is summed up by 
2i 
Similarly, B always occurs with E or F as dependents, i.e., 
and C occurs with no dependents or  else with both G and F, i.e., 
c (* \[O F\]). 
These rules express co-occurrence relationships more  directly 
than the original rules do. Let us assume this constraint and re- 
design DG3 as DG4. Let the augmented DG4 be: 
Ax iom: ? (A) 
Dependency Rules : 
i. A ( zB"  I \ [ tC  D} E l )

SPG4 i s  s t ruc ture  f ree .  Fur thermore ,  i t  has  on ly  one  ax iom,  
whereas  SPG3 had  two even  though der ived  f rom a DG wh ich  had  
on ly  one.  
The  add i t iona l  res t r i c t ions  proposed  fo r  DG and SPG in  
d i scuss ions  of the  resu l t s  of convers ion  by these  methods  are  not  
c ruc ia l  as  fa r  as  obta in ing  sys temat ica l ly  cor respond ing  gram-  
mars  i s  concerned .  Wi thout  them,  every  complete  subt ree  of a 
D- t ree  w i l l  cor respond to a complete  subt ree  of a P - t ree  over  the  
same s t r ing ,  and  every  complete  subt ree  of the  P - t ree  w i l l  cor -  
respond to a connected  subt ree  of a D- t ree  over  the  same s t r ing .  
(No fo rmal  p roo f  of th i s  was  g iven ,  but  the  methods  of const ruct ing  
an  IRL  make i t  moderate ly  apparent . )  Hays  \[5\] suggests  the  te rm 
re la t iona l  cor respondence  fo r  th i s  s ta te  of a f fa i r s .  A l so  there  i s  a 
sys temat ic  re la t ionsh ip  between the  categor ies  of the  two gram-  
mars~ wh ich  the  TS makes  exp l i c i t .  
Somet imes  that  re la t ionsh ip  is  s imp le ,  as  in  the  case  of 
DG4 and  SPG4.  G iven  any  category  of  DG4,  there  is  exact ly  one  
category  of SPG4 f rom which  the  same set  of  s t r ings  i s  der ivab le .  
The  re la t ionsh ip  a l so  ho lds  between the  categor ies  of DGt  and  
SPGt ,  and  between those  of DG2 and  SPG2.  Under  these  cond i -  
t ions ,  Hays  \[5\] ca l l s  the  categor ies  "substant ive ly  equ iva lent" .  
The  re la t ionsh ip  between the  categor ies  of DG3 and  SPG3 i s  less  
s imple .  There  the set  of s t r ings  der ivab le  f rom A of the  DG i s  
the  un ion  of the  set  of s t r ings  der ivab le  f rom S and  Z of the  SPG,  
and  the set  der ivab le  f romB is  the  un ion  d the set  der ivab le  f rom 
W and V. 
Hays says that a D-tree and a P-tree correspond if they 
correspond relationally and if the category at the origin of every 
complete subtree of the D-tree is substantively equivalent to the 
category  labe l ing  the  complete  subt ree  of the  P - t ree  re la ted  to it .  
If  a DG and an  SPG "have  the same termina l  a lphabet ,  and  fo r  
every  s t r ing  over  that  a lphabet ,  every  s t ruc ture  a t t r ibuted  by 
e i ther  cot / responds  to a s t ruc ture  a t t r ibuted  by  the  o ther" ,  he  ca l l s  
the  two grammars  "s t rong ly  equ iva lent" .  \[5, p. 52t \ ]  We pre fer  
to say  that  they  cor respond substant ive ly ,  s ince  re la t iona l  cor re -  
spondence  i s  asymmetr ic  and  there  are  a lways  " le f t -over"  SPG 
23 
categories to which no DG category is substantively equivalent. 
The weaker relationship exhibited by SPG3 and DG3, where some 
DG categories are not substantively equivalent to any single SPG 
category, we have been calling systematic correspondence. 
i 
Conversion by the methods given here results in systema- 
tic' correspondence. If the suggested constraints, which appear to 
be linguistically well-mot~vated for base components of transfor- 
mational g rammars ,  are imposed on the form of the source gram-  
mar, the target g rammar  corresponds substantively as well as 
systematically to the source grammar  and both are structure free.
