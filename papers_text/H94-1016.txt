ABSTRACT 
We attemped to improve recognition accuracy by reduc- 
ing the inadequacies of the lexicon and language model. 
Specifically we address the following three problems: (1) 
the best size for the lexicon, (2) conditioning written text 
for spoken language recognition, and (3) using additional 
training outside the text distribution. We found that in- 
creasing the lexicon 20,000 words to 40,000 words re- 
duced the percentage of words outside the vocabulary 
from over 2% to just 0.2%, thereby decreasing the error 
rate substantially. The error rate on words already in the 
vocabulary did not increase substantially. We modified 
the language model training text by applying rules to sim- 
ulate the differences between the training text and what 
people actually said. Finally, we found that using another 
three years' of training text - even without the appropri- 
ate preprocessing, substantially improved the language 
model We also tested these approaches on spontaneous 
news dictation and found similar improvements. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Speech recognition accuracy is affected as much by the lan- 
guage model as by the acoustic model. In general, the word 
error rate is roughly proportional to the square root of the 
perplexity of the language model. In addition, in a natural 
unlimited vocabulary task, a substantial portion of the word 
errors come from words that are not even in the recognition 
vocabulary. These out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words have no 
chance of being recognized correctly. Thus, our goal is to 
estimate a good language model from the available training 
text, and to determine a vocabulary that is likely to cover 
the test vocabulary. 
The straightforward solution to improving the language 
model might be to increase the complexity of the model 
(e.g., use a higher order Markov chain) and/or obtain more 
language model training text. But this by itself will not nec- 
essarily provide a better model, especially if the text is not 
an ideal model of what people will actltally say. The simple 
solution to increase the coverage of the vocabulary is to in- 
crease the vocabulary size. But this also increases the word 
error rate and the computation and size of the recognition 
process. 
In this paper we consider several simple techniques for im- 
proving the power of the language model. First, in Section 
3, we explore the effect of increasing the vocabulary size on 
recognition accuracy in an unlimited vocabulary task. Sec- 
ond, in Section 4, we consider ways to model the differences 
between the language model Iraining text and the way peo- 
ple actually speak. And third, in Section 5, we show that 
simply increasing the amount of language model training 
helps significantly. 
2. THE WSJ  CORPUS 
The November 1993 ARPA Continuous Speech Recognition 
(CSR) evaluations was based on speech and language taken 
from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The standard language 
model training text was estimated from about 35 million 
words of text extracted from the WSJ from 1987 to 1989. 
The text was normalized (preprocessed) with a model for 
what words people use to read open text. For example, 
"$234.56" was always assumed to be read as "two hundred 
thirty four dollars and fifty six cents". "March 13" was 
always normalized as "March thirteenth" - not "March the 
thirteenth", nor "March thirteen". And so on. 
The original processed text contains about 160,000 unique 
words. However, many of these are due to misspellings. 
Therefore, the test corpus was limited to those sentences that 
consisted only of the most likely 64,000 words. While this 
vocabulary is still quite large, it has two beneficial effects. 
First, it greatly reduces the number of misspellings in the 
texts. Second, it allows implementations to use 2-byte data 
fields to represent the words rather than having to use 4 
bytes. 
The "standard" recognition vocabulary was defined as the 
most likely 20,000 words in the corpus. Then, the standard 
language model was defined as a trigram language model 
estimated specifically for these 20K words. This standard 
model, provided by Lincoln Laboratory, was to be used for 
the controlled portion of the recognition tests. In addition, 
participants were encouraged to generate an improved lan- 
guage model by any means (other than examining the test 
data).

3. RECOGNIT ION LEX ICON 
We find that, typically, over 2% of the word occurrences in a 
development set are not included in the standard 20K-word 
vocabulary. Naturally, words that are not in the vocabu- 
lary cannot be recognized accurately. (At best, we might 
try to detect hat there is one or more unknown words at 
this point in a sentence, and then attempt to recognize the 
phoneme sequence, and then guess a possible letter sequence 
for this phoneme sequence. Unfortunately, in English, even 
if we could recognize the phonemes perfectly, there are 
many valid ways to spell a particular phoneme sequence.) 
However, in addition to this word not being recognized, we 
often see that one or two words adjacent to this missing word 
are also misrecognized. This is because the recognition, in 
choosing a word in its vocabulary, also now has the wrong 
context for the following or preceding words. In general, 
we find that the word error rate increases by about 1.5 to 2 
times the number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. 
One simple way to decrease the percentage of OOV words 
is to increase the vocabulary size. But which words should 
be added? The obvious solution is to add words in order of 
their relative frequency within the full text corpus. There 
are several problems that might result from this: 
1. The vocabulary might have to be extremely large be- 
fore the OOV rate is reduced significantly. 
2. If the word error rate for the vast majority of the words 
that are already in the smaller vocabulary increased by 
even a small amount, it might offset any gain obtained 
from reducing the OOV rate. 
3. The language model probabilities for these additional 
words would be quite low, which might prevent them 
from being recognized anyway. 
We did not have phonetic pronunciations for all of the 64K 
words. We sent a list of the (approximately 34K) words for 
which we had no pronunciations toBoston University. They 
found pronunciations for about half (18K) of the words in 
their (expanded Moby) dictionary. When we added these 
words to our WSJ dictionary, we had a total of 50K words 
that we could use for recognition. 
The following table shows the percentage ofOOV words as a 
function of the vocabulary size. The measurement was done 
on the WSJ1 Hubl "20K" development test which has 2,464 
unique words with the total count of 8,227 words. Due to the 
unavailability of phonetic pronunciations (mentioned above), 
the final vocabulary size would be the second column. 
We were somewhat surprised to see that the percentage of 
OOV words was reduced to only 0.17% when the lexicon 
included the most likely 40K words - especially given that 
many of the most likely words were not available because 
we did not have phonetic pronunciations for them. Thus, 
Top N Vocab. #OOV % 
20k 19998 187 2.27 
30k 28247 85 1.03 
40k 35298 39 0.47 
48k 40213 14 0.17 
50k 41363 12 0.15 
64k 48386 1 0.01 
it was not necessary to increase the vocabulary above 40K 
words. 
The second worry was that increasing the vocabulary by too 
much might increase the word error rate due to the increased 
number of choices. For example, normally, if we double the 
vocabulary, we might expect an increase in word error rate 
of about 40%! So we performed an experiment in which 
we used the standard 20K language model for the 5K de- 
velopment data. We found, to our surprise, that the error 
rate increased only slightly, from 8.7% to 9.3%. Therefore, 
we felt confident that we could increase the vocabulary as 
needed. 
We considered possible explanations for the small increase 
in error due to a larger vocabulary. We realized that the an- 
swer was in the language model. In the first case, when we 
just increase the vocabulary, the new words also have the 
same probability in the language model as the old words. 
However, in this case, all the new words that were added 
had lower probabilities (at least for the unigram model) than 
the existing words. Let us consider two possibilities that we 
would not falsely substitute a new word for an old one. If 
the new word were acoustically similar to one of the words 
in the test (and therefore similar to a word in the original 
vocabulary, then the word would be correctly recognized be- 
cause the original word would always have a higher language 
model probability. If, on the other hand, the new word were 
acoustically very different from the word being spoken, then 
we might expect hat our acoustic models would prevent the 
new word from being chosen over the old word. While the 
argument makes some sense, we did not expect he loss for 
increasing the vocabulary from 5K words to 20K words to 
be so small. 
Finally, the third question is whether the new words would 
be recognized when they did occur, since (as mentioned 
above) their language model probabilities were generally 
low. In fact, we found that, even though the error rate for 
these new words was higher than for the more likely words, 
we were still able to recognize about 50% to 70% of them 
correctly, presumably based largely on the acoustic model. 
Thus, the net effect of this was to reduce the word error rate 
by about 1% to 1.5%, absolute.

4. MODEL ING SPOKEN LANGUAGE 
Another effect hat we worked on was the difference between 
the l~:ocessed text, as defined by the preprocessor, and the 
words that people actually used when reading WSJ text. In 
the pilot WSJ corpus, the subjects were prompted with texts 
that had already been "normalized", so that there was no 
ambiguity about how to read a sentence. However, in the 
WSJ1 corpus, subjects were instructed to read the original 
texts and to say whatever seemed most appropriate to them. 
Since the WSJ1 prompting texts were not normalized to 
deterministic word sequences, ubjects howed considerable 
variability in their reading of the prompting text. 
However, the standard language model was derived from the 
normalized text produced by the preprocessor. This resulted 
in a mismatch between the language model and the actual 
word sequences that were spoken. While the preprocessor 
was quite good at predicting what people said most of the 
time, there were several cases where people used different 
words than predicted. For example, the preprocessor p e- 
dicted that strings like "$234" would be read as "two hun- 
dred thirty four dollars". But in fact, most people read this 
as "two hundred AND thirty four dollars". For another ex- 
treme example, the preprocessor's prediction of "10.4" was 
"ten point four", but the subject (in the WSJ1 development 
data) read this as "ten and four tenths". There were many 
other similar examples. 
The standard model for the tests was the "nonverbalized 
punctuation" (NVP) model, which assumes that the reeaders 
never speak any of the punctuation words. The other model 
that had been defined was the "verbalized punctuation" (VP) 
model, which assumed that all of the punctuation was read 
out loud. This year, the subjects were instructed that they 
were free to read the punctuation out loud or not, in what- 
ever way they feel most comfortable. It turns out that people 
didn't verbalize most punctuation. However, they regularly 
verbalized quotation marks in many different ways that were 
all different than the ways predicted by the standard prepro- 
cessor. 
There were also several words that were read differently by 
subjects. For example, subjects pronounced abbreviations 
like, "CORP." and "INC.". While the preprocessor assumed 
that all abbreviations would be read as full words. 
We used two methods to model the ways people actually 
read text. The simpler approach was to include the text of 
the acoustic training data in the language model training. 
That is, we simply added the 37K sentence transcriptions 
from the acoustic training to the 2M sentences of training 
text. The advantage of this method is that it modeled what 
people actually said. The system was definitely more likely 
to recognize words or sequences that were previously impos- 
sible. The problem with this method was that the amount of 
transcribed speech was quite small (about 50 times smaller) 
compared to the original training text. We tried repeating 
the transcriptions several times, but we found that the effect 
was not as strong as we would like. 
A more powerful approach was to simulate the effects of the 
different word choices by simple rules which were applied 
to all of the 35M words of language training .text. We chose 
to use the following rules: 
Preprocessed Text 
HUNDRED \[number\] 
ONE HUNDRED 
ONE DOLLAR 
ZERO POINT \[number\] 
AND ONE HALF 
AND ONE QUARTER 
Simulated Text 
HUNDRED AND \[number\] 
A HUNDRED 
A DOLLAR 
POINT \[number\] 
AND A HALF 
AND A QUARTER 
Thus, for example, ff the sentence consists of the pattern 
"hundred twenty", we repeated the same sentence with "hun- 
dred AND twenty". 
The result was that about one fifth of the sentences in the 
original corpus had some change reflecting a difference in 
the way subjects read the original text. Thus, this was equiv- 
alent in weight to an equal amount of training text to the 
original text. 
We found that this preprocessing of the text was sufficient to 
cover most of those cases where the readers aid things dif- 
ferently than the predictions. The recognition results howed 
that the system now usually recognized the new word se- 
quences and abbreviations correctly. 
5. INCREASING THE LANGUAGE MODEL 
TRAIN ING 
While 35M words may seem like a lot of data, it is not 
enough to cover all of the trigrams that are likely to occur 
in the testing data. So we considered other sources for ad- 
ditional anguage modeling text. The only easily accessible 
data available was an additional 3 years (from 1990-1992) 
of WSJ data from the TIPSTER corpus produced by the 
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). 
However, there were two problems with using this data. 
First, since the test data was known to come from 1987- 
1989, we were concerned that this might actually hurt per- 
forrnance due to some differences in the topics during that 
3-year period. Second, this text had not been normalized 
with the preprocessor and we did not have available to us 
the preprocessor that was used to transform the raw text into 
word sequences. 
We decided to use the new text with minimal processing. 
The text was filtered to remove all tables, captions, num- 
bers, etc. We replaced each initial example of double-quote 
(") with "QUOTE and the matching token with "UNQUOTE 
or "ENDQUOTE, which were the most common ways these 
words were said. No other changes were made. We just 
96  
used the raw text as it was. One benefit of this was that ab- 
breviations were left as they appeared in the text rather than 
expanded. Any numbers, dates, dollar amounts, etc, were 
just considered "unknown" words, and did not contribute to 
the training. We assumed that we had sufficient examples 
of numbers in the original text. 
We found that adding this additional language training dam 
reduced the er~r by about 7% of the error, indicating that the 
original 35 million words was not sufficient for the models 
we were using. Thus, the addition of plain text, even though 
it was from a different hree years, and had many gaps due 
to apparent unknown words, still improved the recognition 
accuracy considerably. 
6. RESULTS 
The following table shows the benefit of the enlarged 40K 
lexicon and the enhanced language model training on the 
OOV rate and the word error for the development test and 
the evaluation test. 
% OOV % Word Error 
Test Set 20K 40K 20K 40K 
Development 2.27 0.17 16.4 12.9 
Evaluation 1.83 0.23 14.2 12.2 
Surprisingly, the addition of three year's LM training (from 
a period post-dating the test data) improved performance on 
the utterances that were completely inside the vocabulary. 
Evidently, even the common trigrams are poorly trained with 
only the 35 million word WSJ0 corpus. Overall, our mod- 
ifications to the lexicon and grammar training reduced the 
word error by 14--22%. 
7. Spontaneous Dictation 
Another area we investigated was spontaneous dictation. 
The subjects were primarily former or practicing journal- 
ists with some experience at dictation. They were instructed 
to dictate general and financial news stories that would be 
appropriate for a newspaper like WSJ. In general, the jour- 
nalists chose topics of recent interest. This meant hat the 
original anguage model was often out of date for the sub- 
ject. As a result, the percentage of OOV words increased 
(to about 4%), and the language model taken from WSJ text 
was less appropriate. 
The OOV words in the spontaneous data were more likely 
to be proper nouns from recent events that were not covered 
by the LM training material. To counter this, we added all 
(1,028) of the new words that were found in the spontaneous 
portion of the acoustic training data in WSJ1. This mostly 
included topical names (e.g., Hillary Rodham, NAFTA, etc.). 
In order to account for some of the differences between the 
read text and the spontaneous text, and to have language 
model probabilities for the new words, we added the train- 
ing transcriptions of the spontaneous dictation (about 8K 
sentences) to the LM training as well. 
New weights for the new language model, HMM, and Seg- 
mental Neural Network were all optimized on spontaneous 
development test data. The table below shows that the OOV 
remains near 1% even after the enlargement to a 41K lexi- 
con. 
% OOV % Word Error 
Test Set 20K 40K 41K 20K 41K 
Development 2.9 1.4 0.8 - 21.7 
Evaluation 4.8 1.9 1.5 24.7 19.1 
As can be seen, increasing the vocabulary size from 20K 
to 40K significantly reduced the OOV rate. It is important 
to point out that in this case, we did not have the ben- 
efit of a word frequency list for spontaneous speech, and 
that the source of speech had an unlimited vocabulary. So 
the reduction in OOV rate is certainly a fair - if not pes- 
simistic - estimate of the real benefit from increasing the 
vocabulary. Adding the few new words observed in the 
spontaneous speech also helped somewhat, but not nearly as 
much. The sample of only 8,000 sentences i clearly not 
sufficient o find all the new words that people might use. 
Presumably, if the sample of spontaneous speech were large 
enough to derive word frequencies, then we could choose a 
much better list of 40K words with a lower OOV rate. 
Overall, the 41K trigram reduces the word error by 23% 
over the 20K standard trigram on the November '93 CSR $9 
evaluation test. We estimate that more than half of this gain 
was due to the decreased percentage of OOV words, and the 
remainder was due to the increased language model training, 
including specific examples of spontaneous dictation. 
8. CONCLUSIONS 
We found the following interesting results: 
? Expanding the vocabulary with less frequent words 
does not substantially increase the word error on those 
words already in the vocabulary, but does eliminate 
many errors due to OOV words. 
? Doubling the amount of language model training text 
improves the language model, even though the text 
comes from different years than the test, and even 
though the text was not preprocessed into proper lexi- 
cal forms. 
? It is possible to improve the quality of the language 
modeling text by modeling the differences between the 
97  
predicted rre~ding style and some examples of actual 
transcriptions. 
? Increasing the vocabulary size and language training 
hadL a bigger effect on spontaneous speech than it did 
for read speech.
