I. The Text-to-Speech System 
A system to convert unregtricted printed text to speech has been under 
development for several years at M.I.T. 1,2,3 The approach has been to model 
the proces-s employed by a nat'ive speaker of English when reading aloud. In 
order to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation of 
English words, it has been necessary to reflect the basic nature of linguis- 
tic processes. Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on the 
development of morphological and phon~logical analysis, stress patterns, 
parsing systems and prosodic correlates. 
It i$ possible, using the current system, to convert any English word 
or string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech. In 
order to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilized 
including mo~phological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules and 
phonemic speech synthesis. Prosodic studies are now in grogress; experi- 
mental parameters for fo contours and timing patterns will soon be included 
In %he system. 
The letter-string which represents a word is usually converted to a 
phoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morpho- 
lop,ical analysis. Amorph lexicon c - o n t n i n i n q  approximately 11,000 entries 
has been d r v ~ l  loped and is  i l sed  i n  r o n  j r i n c t  ion with n rnorph dec*ompos i t  ion  
a l g o r i t h m .  I n c l u d e d  i n  the lexicon are two m a j o r  classes  oE rnorphs. One 
I 1  1 1  I I class is composed of roots such as trust" and snow, i . c .  ; words which cqlr 
occur alone, and bound roots such as -ceive perceive, receive, connive), 
rot- (rotary, rotate, rotor) and -miss- (dismiss, missive, permiqsiveness). 
A? fixes make up the second class and may be attached either to roots or t c  
bound morphemes. Accompanying each l e x i c a l  e n t r y  is  i t s  phonemic representa-  
t i o n ,  i t s  morph class and its p a r t ( s )  of speech. 
Algorithfnic decomposifion of l e t t e r - s t r i n g s  models the p r ~ c e d u r e  used 
by a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not  immediately 
recognize o r  has previously  no t  encountered. I f  the word i s  not  immediately 
1 I 
recognizable ,  i , e . ,  i f  ~t is  not  i n  t h e  l e ~ i c o n "  of the  n a t i v e  speaker i n  
i ts  e n t i r e t y ,  an at tempt w i l l  be made t o  break i t  a p a r t  i n t o  i t s  constitu'ent 
morphs. Such a process is  probably used when oAe reads a word s k h  a s  
"ant idises tabl ishmentar ianism,"  e a r t h r i s e "  o r  "cranappley f o r  the T i r s t  t i m e  
The a lgor i thm a l s o  models t h e  a b i l i t y  t o  recognize mutations such 2 s  
t h e  dropping of a fLbal s i l e n t  i e l4  (observe - observance),  t h e  doubling of 
a f i n a l  consonant (red-reddest') and the  s u b s t i t u t i o n  of ti1 f o r  f i n a l  [yl 
preceding v o c a l i c  s u f f i x e s  (glory - g l o r i o u s ) .  Morphophonemic r u l e s  are 
a l s o  included,  modeling the a b i l i t y  t o  g i v e  a c o r r e c t  pronunciat ion f o r  any 
p l u r a l  (horses ,  c a t s ,  dogs) or  pas t  tense ( q u i e t e d ,  hushed, whispered), and 
t o  p a l a t a l i z e  i n  appropr i a t e  contex ts  ( s c u l p t  - s c u l p t u r e ,  confuse - confu- 
s i o n )  . 
Another f e a t u r e  of t h e  a lgor i thm i s  a s e t  of selectional r u l e s  whit\, 
although very simple i n  form, choose the corpect  morphemic analysis from all 
p o s s i b i l i t i e s  i n  a large number of cases. A standard form f o r  sequences of 
morphemes is  compared with  each p o s s i b i i i t y ,  and r u l e s  describing p r e f e r r e d  
composition are used i n  a pa i rwise  comparison leading t o  an acceptable 
r e s u l t .  The word "formally" provides an example i n  which the o n l y  rule 
needed is one s t a t i n g  t h a t  a roo t  followed by a s u f f i x  i s  p r e f e r a b l e  t o  two 
concatenated r o o t s .  Poss ib le  decompositionsof the word "formally" are 
1 t detected as foklows (R represents root1' and $, tlsuf-fix") :
form (R) + a1 (S) + ly (S) f o m  (R) + ally (R) 
for. (R) ,+ mall (R) + y (S) form (R) + all (R) + y (S) 
It is clear that the correct decomposition is the only candidate having the 
form of a single root followed by suffixes. 
When a complete morphemic analysis fails, that is, when a word encoun- 
tered by a'native speaker cannot be se~arated into its constituent morphemes, 
or when it is so infrequent in the English language that he has previously 
not encountered it, a "letter-to-sound" system is invoked, i . e . ,  an attempt 
is made to sound out the word letter by 'letter. The competence of a native 
speaker which allows him to perform this convemsion is based on correspon- 
dence& between l'etters and sounds in English which have been internalized 
through experience. (A native speaker will also apply the same correspon- 
dences to a foreign-word from any language of which he has nQ knowledge.) 
A scheme; to model this process,musE be made available, sequenced after the 
decomposition algorithm, in,order to be ablk to convert unrestricted text to 
speech. The text-ro-speech system includes a phonological model having a 
two-phase structure: the first phase is 3 set of rules which converts 
letters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stress 
on the converted phonemes. 
This system has been implemented ;In RCPI, on n DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10 
inbMAC LISP.  
Onp might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, it 
is necessary to have a lexicon. There hre three reasons; all are restrictions 
which must be imposed om any viabl'e letter-to-sound system. -First, it has 
been observed t h a t  high-frequency wotds perhaps because of ex tens ive  use ,  do 
nbt  always fo l low le t te r - to-sound r u l e s .  For example, t h e  on ly  i n s t a n c e  i n  
which a f i n a l  Lf] is pronounced a s  /v/ is  i n  t h e  word "of I f  The l e t t e r  [w] 
9 I fo l lowing a consonant is  g e n e r a l l y  pronounced l i k e  t h e  [w] i n  sweett1 o r  
" t w ~ l l , "  b u t  i n  t h e  word "two" i t  is  not  pronounced a t  a l l .  A study5 of t h e  
200 most f r equen t  words i n  English according t o  t h e  Bl'own corpusb a s  made t o  
determine t h e i r  r e g u l a r i t y  of pronuncia t ion .  It w a s  found t h a t  a l though t h e  
r e g u l a r  case i s  t h a t  a f i n a l  [el preceded by a s i n g l e  consonant (o the r  than  [ rJ)  
lengfhhns t h e  preceding vowel, four  of t h e  200 words, i . e . ,  "haveft (compare 
I t  
"behave, " "shave") , one, 11 I1 I I some" and come," (compare "ldne," "ode") a r e  
except ions.  The c a s e  of i n i t i a l  [th] i s  even more i r r e g u l a r  among high- 
I - -  
frequencyword$. I'n most Eng l i sh  words, i n i t i a l  ;th j is unvoiced as i n  
If J f  11 
" t h i s t l e ,  fKin,"  " thesis . ,  However, twelve of t h e  200 words began with 
voiced [ t h l .  
Secondly, it must b e  recognized t h a t  t h e  f e t t e r ~ t o - s o u n d  r u l e s  which 
o p e r a t e  w i t h i n  a morpheme, do not ,  ~ e c e s s a r i l y  apply  a c r o s s  morph bounddries.  
In  p a r t i c u l a r ,  t h e  p ronunc ia t i an  of compounds t e q u i r e s  a l ex icon .  Such-words 
as "hc&house" o r  "potherbff  might e therwise  appear t o  c o n t a i n  t h e  consonant 
c l u s t e r  l t h ] ,  and t h e  motph-final s r l e n t  e ]  i n  "houseboatf1 would certain1 y not 
be s i l e n t  i f  t h e  word were n o t  recognized as a compound. The a p p l i c a t i o n  of 
le t te r - to-sound r u l e s  must t h e r e f o r e  be restricted to words conta in ing  no more 
than  a s i n g l e  r o o t .  
Thirdly, f o r e i g n  words which r e t a i n  t h e i r  o r i g i n a l  p r m u n c i a t i o n  must 
be l e x i c a l  e n t r i e s .  The e n t r i e s  may be made i n  t h e  same way a n a t i v e  speaker  
of E n g l i s h  m u l d  add a f o r e i g n  word to h i s  vocabulary,  i.e., by pronouncing i t  
as if 13 were an English word (using English letter-to-sound rules) until 
informed of its correct pronunciation, and then plaCing it in his mental 
lexico?. 
It is apparent, then, that both morphnlogical and phonological 
systems are necessary and that together, in sequence, they can provide a 
phonemic representat ion fo r  any English word presented for conversion t o  
speech. 
Although, at present, there is no ingergction between the decomposition 
and letter-to-phoneme algorithms, a more highly efficient System could be 
developed in the future. The size of the lexicon could be reduced, f6r 
example, by app.l!ication of stress placement rules to the output 8f the 
decomposition algorithm or by omitting unnecessary phonemic representations

Application of Letrer-to-Solin-d Rules 
within the two sets of rules for conversion of consonants and vowels, 
ordering proceeds from longer strings to shester strings and, for each 
string,,from specific context to general context. The rule for pronuncia- 
tion uf [cch] , then, appears before rhe rules for [cc] and ich], each of 
which is ordered before rules for LC] and [h]. Procedures for the recog- 
nition of prefixes and suffixes also require an ordering: t'le pfefixes 
lcomj and [con] must be ordered before [co]; any suffSx ending with the 
letter Ls] must be recognizpd before the suffix consisting of 'that letter 
only. 
As an example of ordering rules for a particular string, consider 
the vowel [a] and .assume that it is followed by the Letter Cr]. This [a f 
1 I may be pr,onounced like the [ a? in "warp, " "lariat" or carp" depending 
upon spebif ication of further context. It is pronounced like the [ a] in 
I I carp" if it is followed by [r] and another consonant (other than Lr]) 
and if it is preceded by any consonant phoneme except /w/ (n,ote "quarter, 11 
"wharf") Consequentlv, a rule for [a1 in the context of being preceded 
7 by the phoneme /w/ ~d.followed by the sequence [ r ~ ]  is placed in the set- 
of rules. ~~rcif'ication of a left context in the rule for the [a] in 
11 carp" is subsequentl! Unnecessary. If the [a] is preceded by a /w/ ,  t h i s  
rule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for vowel 
digraph9 will already have- applied. Using this method. rules may be stated 
simply and without redundancy. 
Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal 
8 inspection and reference to published works, e.g. ,  Venezky. By ,a process 
of extensive statistical analysis, other rules were added and ordered

In the first stage, [icl is recognized as a suffix and a plus (+) is 
inserted to its left. Since no \other affixes are recognized, Stage 1 is 
terminated. 
Morph-initial Cpt) is pronouhced It/, and [ 1) and [m] are given the 
pronunciation= /1/ and /m/ respettively, according to the most general rule 
in the rule sequence for each. (The most general rule is the final rule in 
the rule sequence and contains no specified context.) 
In Stage 3, the contexts of the vowels lo ]  and [el are not among 
those contexts specified in the sequence of rules and are pronounced accord- 
ing to the final, context-independent rule. The vowel lal, on the other 
hand,, precedes anokher vowel and, for this reason is lengthened (tensed). 
The suffix [+ic] is word-final and receives the pronunciation /TIC/, In the 
final result, stress rules have beeg applied and unstressed non-tense vowels 
have been reduced. 
Generalizations and Relhted Rules 
) Morph-initial Lpm] and [ps] are given the pronunciations /n/ and 
/s/ respectively, the [ p] remaining silent as in morph-initial Lptl. 
2.) Vowels in pre-vocalic position are usually lengthened (tensed).

s-rn b~rio Final ~ s u l t  af;ter stress 
In Stage 2 -we find that the consonant cluster [sc], like the let.ter 
[ c ] ,  usually has the sound of /s /  preceding [el, ti] or Cy]. The letter [r] 
does not occur in any cohtext given in its rule sequence and is therefore 
given h s  mosg general pronunciation. Thereis only one rule for the pronun- 
ciation of Cn] . 
Moving on to Stage 3, the vowel [el receives the pronunciatian /t/ 
given by its most geperal rule. The vowel [a] follows the rule given in the 
previous example. The yowel [o] is morph-final and has the feature 
[-constricted pharynx], and is lengthened acco~dingly. Because the vovel [i] 
precedes another vowel,, it is lengthened also. 13

applies assigns the phoneme / z /  
In the final stage of letter-to-phoneme conversion, the affixes and 
vowels are considered. The prefix [sub=) has only one possible pronuncia- 
tion. The letter [el, because it precedes the sequence [r~] where the 
consonant, C, is not an [I;], is given the pronunciation / A / .  The palatal 
phoneme /;/ now forms a left context for -the suffix [$ion], which, being 
word-final, is pronounced /an/. 
Generalizations and Related Rules 
1 .) Because (+s] is marked as occurring in word-f inal position orly, 
ihe \s] preceding [+ion] is not recognized as a suffix*. This  
step also prevents the [eK] preceding the is] from considera- 
tion as a possible suffix. 
2.) When an [s] pre~~ding the sequence [+i~] or [i~] is preceded by 
either a vowel o r  an [r], it is usually pronounced /;/. Some 
11 11 I1 examples are revision, artesion, " "Persian" and "dispersion" ; 
two exceptions are "controv~rsial" and "torsion. " When [ s ]  2s 
preceded by [I], and when it occurs as part of the consonant 
cluster [ s s ]  , the phoneme preceding the  \ v o w e l  sequence is /f/ ,

Conversion of the Main Stress Rule into aigorithmic form is facilitated 
by ordering the above cases in the following manner: 
Algorithmic Order of Application: (1) If the final syllable is the 
only syllable, or if it consists of a long vowel followed 'by at least one 
consonant, the final vowel receives primary strgss. Otherwise, (2) if there 
are only two syllables, or if the penultimate syllable terminates in more 
than one consonant or if it consists of a bng vowel follmed by at least one 
consonant, the penultimate vowel receives primary stress. Otherwise, ( 3 )  
the antepenultimate vowel receives primary stress, 
Modifications: The presence of the optimal vowel immegiatel~ preced- 
ing another vowel and the presence of the morph-final vowel are necessary

vowel+ with primary stress is (a) the rigfit-most vowel in the word, or (b) 
the right-most vowel with the exception of a final syllable chpased of an 
unstressed /i/, the first primary-stressed vowel to its left retains primary 
stress and all other primary stress is reduced to secondary. 
Modifications: As mentioned previously, input to the stress rules

has been substituted due to unavailability of the original brthogsaphy. 
The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories. 
Those suffixes discussed under Condition (2) of the Main Stress Rule which 
do not affect stress placement are excepted from the Bamain of the Compound 
Stress  Rule if they are either word-final or precede another word-final 
suffix in the same category. 
The other category of suffixes is marked for special stress retention. 
The fellowing suffixes retain primary stress in word-final position under 
Condition (2) of the Compound Stress Rule:

EE: trainee, legatee 
2 1 2 1 
EER: buccaneer, engineet 
2 1 2 I 
ESCE: luminesce, acquiesce 
2 1 2 1 
ESQUE : arabesque, Romanesque 
2 1 Z B  1 
ETTE : marionette, majorette 
Z 1 1 
OON : macaroon, baboon 
The foldowing suffix does not retain primary stress on the penulti- 
mate syllable under Condition (2) of the Compound Stress Rule:

ISM: Babism, dRomanticism 
Note: Th&s categorization is equivalent to the statement that 
syllabic M does not function as a syllable .in morph-final 
position. The same s t ress  pattern appears in wordp ending 
in [ithm], although it is not included here as a sbffix, e.g., 
1 2  1 2

The same categorization should be extended to morph-final 
syllabic 113. However, it does not function as a suffix,

A Stress-Depe'hden~ Letter-to-Phoneme Rule 
The rule which follows appears to be stress-dependent and was placed 
in the stress placement section rather than with other letter-to-phoneme 
rules : 
Rule: The phoneme it/ is changed to /$/ and the phoneme /d/ to /J/ 
if it is not in the initial consonant cluster and precedes unstressed /u/ 
or /U/,  or if it precedestlnstressed /a/ which was /u/ or /U/ before applica- 
tion of stress placement rules. 
2 1 2 1 
Example : perpetuity (It/) perpetual ( I : / )  
Examples (showing wards which do not fit the context of the rule and 
'herefire retain /t/ or I d /  as pronunciation): 
1 1 I 1 1 
(a) tutor, duty, studious, duration, Lureen 
In these -cases, the /t/ or /d/ is in the initial consonant 
cluster 
2 1 1 1 
(b) adumbration, - modus, - status - 
The It/ o r  /d/ in these cases is not in the initial consonant 
cluster; but precedes unstressed /9/ which was not /u/ or 
/ U/  before  application of stress rules. 
2 I 2 1 1 1 2 
(c) institution, - centurion, - Hindu, - constitute - 
In the above cases, /t/ or /d/ is not in the initial eonso- 
nant cluster and precedes s t r e s s e d  /u/ o r  /U /. 
The stress program has been modified to effect this change. The 
phonemes f t /  and /d/ preceding unstressed /u/ or / U  / not in the first syl- 
lable are chgnged following the cyclic rules which place all stress. After 
the Destressing Rule and the Cursory Rule, a change is also made if the 
destressed (and poss ib ly  'shortened) vowel was previously a /u/ or /u / and 
not in the f irst  syl lable .

There are a number of problem areas, many of which derive from the 
lack of a lekicon. Boblems  of this type include incorrect suffix or prefix 
recognition and the treatment of compounds as single norphs. Some examples 
from each problem area are given below: 
Mispronunciation of single vowel: 
international 
menu 
/e/ modeled / e /  
* 
/u/ strategf - cally / ? /  
environmental - /r/ bur - jed /PI 
hotels - /a/ two -
The pr~nunciations of the underlined vowels in the contexts above 
ark encountered infrequently, and, in most cases, are not predictable. In 
the word international, the context which determines the pronunciation of 
@]is the right-hqnd context Lc+~v], A 10- xowel almost always is found in 
this context as in nation, station, explanation, observational, gensational. 
A short [el is usually found preceding PC], e.g . , maleuc ,  angelic ,. systemic, 
photogenic, and is long only in a few words, e.g., strategic, scenic, and 
the suffix *legit. .There are very few words ending in the vowel[u]-- 
most are ei ther  low frequency words or proper names. The palatalization 
in menu is not found in other words with finallu], e . g . ,  flu, emu, gnu, 
--
i'mprqmptu. The word - two is very irregular in pronunciation. Most words 
ending in[o]such as E, - no, so, calico, echo have the sound lo/. It may 
be noted, however, that two other words which, like -1 two m e  very high fre- 
quency words, have the same pronunciation of final[o]as -9 two i.e., - do, - to.
The mispronunciation of the[e]in modeled is due to the assumption, lacking 
a lexicon, that the morphemic analysis is -- model C - ed.
Mispronunciation of vowel digraph: 
said 
-
break - /i/ 
forfeit 
-
endowed 
- 
shoes 
-
should, - would - 
theirs 
- 
The reasons for mispronunciation of the vowel digraphs underlined above 
fall into a number of categories. There  are very high frequency words, 
said, should and would, which do not follow letter-to-sound rules. Said 
may be contrasted with the words laid, maid, paid, and raid; the words 
should and would contrast with mould, shoulder and boulder. The sequence 
bir] as in theiys, heir, weir is not found frequently in English, nor is 
the sequence (feit] as in for? eit surfsit and counterfeit . Rules for ki] 
,....9 
in these two contexts w@rakcskis:risidered unproductive. ~inal t o 4  in English 
is usually pronounced as in oboe, toe a A  foe; the pronunciation found in 
shoe, and also in canoe, is rare. Rules governing the pronunciation of 
&ow] (endowed) and bi] (guitars) are statistically based. Althougfi there are 
rna~ywordo in- w h i e k h l l a r  nort=ccmt ext dsqxmdmt-prwornlat3m~~s m, 
e.g., -9 cow' allow, eyebrow and build, guilt, guinea, other pronunciations 
are statistically more likely, e.g., those found in shadow, glow, follow 
and bruise, juice, nuisance. The ptonunciation of break is not-predictable 
-- the word steak has the same digraph pronunciation, but other similar 
words such as creak, freak and Streak are pronounced like the majority of 
words congaining the digraph Lea], 
Mispronunciation of .single consonant: 
of 
- /f/ c o r ~  /PI 
eager / j/ exhaust - /h/  
two - /w / physiological - /s/ 
deserts - /s/ schizophrenic - /z/ 
The consonants underlined above are either silent or have unpredict- 
able or unusual pronunciations. Silent consonants are found in two, corp- 
and exhaust .- The yord  two is a h'igh-frequency word in which both the l&] ahd 
b] have unusual pronunciatio~s . Silent M is rare, although it is also 
found in the word sword. Pinal silent [d, as found in corp is also rare. 
(This word is c~~sidered in this section because the pronunciation of both 
the,[r]and therp] are determined by rules for single consonants.) There are 
a few tmrds, like exhaust, in which [h] is .silent following kx], e. g .  exhibit, 
exhilarate, exhort and exhume. However, this rule is not sufficiently 
productive to merit inclusion. 
The letter b] preceding (e],[il and ty] in English usually has a soft sound 
as in integer and wager. In particular, many words ending inber] ark a 
combinatton of a root with final [el and the Buff ix her], e. g . , mrager, manager, 
merger, all of which have a soft [g] sound. The pronunciation of the \g] in 
eager is unusual and not predictable. Another pr~nunciation which is fre- 
quently unpredictable, i.e., not context-dependent,, ts that of the lqtter[s] 
between vowels. The rule for this context predic~ the more frequent sound 
/ s /  whereas the sound / z /  is found in deserts and physiologieal. The 
letter [ z] in schizophrenic has the rgre pronunciation /ts/, and the word - if, 
as previous ly  discussed,  i s  t h e  only English word i n  which a f i n a l  [f] i s

Almost al,l problems i n  t h i s  category arise from the lack of a morph 
lexicon. Words are pronounced incorrect ly  because l e t t e r  s t r i ngs  i n  a 
root  which appear t o  be suffixes are converted t o  phonemes using ,rules 
f o r  su f f i x  pronunciation. It may be seen i n  t he  examples above that a 
mistake i n  morph ana5iysis can cause obvious e r ro r s  i n  pronunciation.

There a r e  many technical  prefixes which have not been included i n  
the  p re f ix  list. These may 6 e  added by a user w i t h  par t icu lar  technical 
needs. A few pref ixes  such as[a]in apart andp] i n  eject  have not  been 
included because a high error rate would result, i.e., all words begipning 
in &or g would be incorrectly analyzed. In the remaining cases, prefixes 
were incorrectly analyzed as part of a root after suffixes were incorrectly 
removed. Errors in pronunciation, and particularly in stress are the result. 
Incorrect stress: 
Most of the words in this category have unusual stress patterns 
which are unpredictable. A comparison with similar words shows the regular 
stress pattern:

1 1 1 
trachea, azalea, miscelanea 
1 1 
unaffordable, uncontestable 
1 '1 1 
erratic, fanatic, aromatic 
brigade, serenade, marinade 
The word selects is stressed incorrectly due to lack of information 
concerning its part of speech (c.f., discussion of modificatiqns in the Main 
Stress Rule). 
The results of this study indicate that the letter-to-phoneme system 
is quite powerful, even in isolaqion. When considered in the domain of the 
over-all text-to-speech system in which a lexicon is available for high- 
frequency words and compounds, the letter-to-phoneme system should be highly  
reliable .

The set of rules which follows is a maximal s e t .  The n largest set 
of rules may be dertved by deleting a l l  l i n e s  preceded by integers less 
than n. 
Preceding the rules are three lists of  variables. (A variable is 
I I symbolized by a letter or the sequence up-arrow'' - l e t t e r ,  s . g . ,  T L  pre- 
ceded by a dollar s ign.)  The first list contains only t w o  variables, $ B ,  
which represents either a word boundary (# )  or a su f f ix  boundary (+), and 
$D, which represents either a word boundary or a prefix bgundary (=). 
The eecond list consists of variables representing let ters* and the f ina l  
list, o f  variables representing phonemes A table of the symbols used t o  
represent phonemes with the corresponding IPA symbol immedfately precedes 
the list of rules: 
The genera  form of a rule is 
where the S .  are strings (S  # (d), / (slash) is one of four possible con- 
l 1 
texts to  be explained below, and (back-arrow) is a place-holder for S . I 
The string S is a letter string which is t o  be converted into the phoneme 1 
string S if it (S  ) is preceded by S and followed by S 2 1 3 4 '  3 4 S and S- may 
be either l e t t e r  s t r i n g s  or phoneme strings g e t  by the following context

The suffix i s  a r egu la r  (non-special) s u f f i x ;  i t  occurs only in word-final 
pos i t i on ;  i t  forms nouns ( 4 )  and verbs  ( 2 )  and may be preceded by a nominal
