Abstract
An increasing range of features is being
used for automatic readability classifica-
tion. The impact of the features typically
is evaluated using reference corpora con-
taining graded reading material. But how
do the readability models and the features
they are based on perform on real-world
web texts? In this paper, we want to take a
step towards understanding this aspect on
the basis of a broad range of lexical and
syntactic features and several web datasets
we collected.
Applying our models to web search re-
sults, we find that the average reading level
of the retrieved web documents is rela-
tively high. At the same time, documents
at a wide range of reading levels are iden-
tified and even among the Top-10 search
results one finds documents at the lower
levels, supporting the potential usefulness
of readability ranking for the web. Finally,
we report on generalization experiments
showing that the features we used gener-
alize well across different web sources.
1 Introduction
The web is a vast source of information on a broad
range of topics. While modern search engines
make use of a range of features for identifying and
ranking search results, the question whether a web
page presents its information in a form that is ac-
cessible to a given reader is only starting to receive
attention. Researching the use of readability as-
sessment as a ranking parameter for web search
can be a relevant step in that direction.
Readability assessment has a long history span-
ning various fields of research from Educational
Psychology to Computer Science. At the same
time, the question which features generalize to dif-
ferent types of documents and whether the read-
ability models are appropriate for real-life appli-
cations has only received little attention.
Against this backdrop, we want to see how well
a state-of-the-art readability assessment approach
using a broad range of features performs when ap-
plied to web data. Based on the approach intro-
duced in Vajjala and Meurers (2012), we thus set
out to explore the following two questions in this
paper:
? Which reading levels can be identified in a
systematic sample of web texts?
? How well do the features used generalize to
different web sources?
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
surveys related work. Section 3 introduces the cor-
pus and the features we used. Section 4 describes
our readability models. Section 5 discusses our ex-
periments investigating the applicability of these
models to web texts. Section 6 reports on a second
set of experiments conducted to test the generaliz-
ability of the features used. Section 7 concludes
the paper with a discussion of our results.
2 Related Work
2.1 Readability Assessment
The need for assessing the readability of a piece
of text has been explored in the educational re-
search community for over eight decades. DuBay
(2006) provides an overview of early readability
formulae, which were based on relatively shallow
features and wordlists. Some of the formulae are
still being used in practice, as exemplified by the
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (Kincaid et al, 1975)
available in Microsoft Word.
More recent computational linguistic ap-
proaches view readability assessment as a
59
classification problem and explore different
types of features. Statistical language modeling
has been a popular approach (Si and Callan,
2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004),
with the hypothesis that the word usage patterns
across grade levels are distinctive enough. Heil-
man et. al. (2007; 2008) extended this approach
by combining language models with manually
and automatically extracted grammatical features.
The relation of text coherence and cohesion
to readability is well explored in the CohMetrix
project (McNamara et al, 2002). Ma et al (2012a;
2012b) approached readability assessment as a
ranking problem and also compared human versus
automatic feature extraction for the task of label-
ing children?s literature.
The WeeklyReader1, an American educational
newspaper with graded readers has been a pop-
ular source of data for readability classification
research in the recent past. Petersen and Osten-
dorf (2009), Feng et al (2009) and Feng (2010)
used it to build readability models with a range
of lexical, syntactic, language modeling and dis-
course features. In Vajjala and Meurers (2012)
we created a larger corpus, WeeBit, by combining
WeeklyReader with graded reading material from
the BBCBitesize website.2 We adapted measures
of lexical richness and syntactic complexity from
Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research as
features for readability classification and showed
that such measures of proficiency can successfully
be used as features for readability assessment.
2.2 Readability Assessment of Web Texts
Despite the significant body of research on read-
ability assessment, applying it to retrieve relevant
texts from the web has elicited interest only in the
recent past. While Benno?hr (2005) and Newbold
et al (2010) created new readability formulae for
this purpose, Ott and Meurers (2010) and Tan et
al. (2012) used existing readability formulae to fil-
ter search engine results. The READ-X project
(Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008; Miltsakaki, 2009)
combined standard readability formulae with topic
classification to retrieve relevant texts for users.
The REAP Project3 supports the lexical acqui-
sition of individual learners by retrieving texts that
suit a given learner level. Kidwell et al (2011) also
1http://weeklyreader.com
2http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize
3http://reap.cs.cmu.edu
used a word-acquisition model for readability pre-
diction. Collins-Thompson et al (2011) and Kim
et al (2012) employed word distribution based
readability models for personalized search and for
creating entity profiles respectively. Nakatani et
al. (2010) followed a language modeling approach
to rank search results to take user comprehension
into account. Google also has an option to filter
search results based on reading level, apparently
using a language modeling approach.4 Kanungo
and Orr (2009) used search result snippet based
features to predict the readability of short web-
summaries.
All the above approaches primarily restrict
themselves to traditional formulae or statistical
language models encoding the distribution of
words. The effect of lexical and syntactic features
as used in recent research on readability thus re-
mains to be studied in a web context. Furthermore,
the generalizability of the features used to other
data sets also remains to be explored. These are
the primary issues we address in this paper.
3 Corpus and Features
Let us turn to answering our first question: Which
reading levels can be identified in a systematic
sample of web texts? To address this question, we
first need to introduce the features we used, the
graded corpus we used to train the model, and the
nature of the readability model.
Since the goal of this paper is not to present
new features but to explore the application of a
readability approach to the web, we here simply
adopt the feature and corpus setup introduced in
Vajjala and Meurers (2012). The WeeBit corpus
used is a corpus of texts belonging to five reading
levels, corresponding to children of age group 7?
16 years. It consists of 625 documents per reading
level. The articles cover a range of fiction and non-
fiction topics. Each article is labeled as belong-
ing to one of five reading levels: Level 2, Level 3,
Level 4, KS3 and GCSE.
We adapted both the lexical and syntactic fea-
tures of Vajjala and Meurers (2012) to build read-
ability models on the basis of the WeeBit corpus
and then studied their applicability to real-world
documents retrieved from the web as well as the
applicability of those features across different web
sources.

Lexical features (LEXFEATURES) The lexical
features are motivated by the lexical richness mea-
sures used to estimate the quality of language
learners? oral narratives (Lu, 2012). We included
several type-token ratio variants used in SLA re-
search: generic type token ratio, root TTR, cor-
rected TTR, bilogarithmic TTR and Uber Index.
In addition, there are lexical variation measures
used to estimate the distribution of various parts
of speech in the given text. They include the
noun variation, adjective variation, modifier vari-
ation, adverb variation and verb variation, which
represent the proportion of words of the respec-
tive part of speech categories compared to all lex-
ical words in the document. Alternative measures
for verb variation, namely, Squared Verb Variation
and Corrected Verb Variation are also included.
Apart from these, we also added the traditionally
used measures of average number of characters
per word, average number of syllables per word,
and two readability formulae, the Flesch-Kincaid
score (Kincaid et al, 1975) and the Coleman-Liau
score (Coleman and Liau, 1975). Finally, we in-
cluded the percentage of words from the Aca-
demic Word List5. It is a list created by Coxhead
(2000) which consists of words that are more com-
monly found in academic texts.
Syntactic features (SYNFEATURES) These
features are adapted from the syntactic complexity
measures used to analyze second language writing
(Lu, 2010). They are calculated based on the
parser output of the BerkeleyParser (Petrov and
Klein, 2007), using the Tregex (Levy and Andrew,
2006) pattern matcher. They include: mean
lengths of various production units (sentence,
clause and t-unit); clauses per sentence and t-unit;
t-units per sentence; complex-t units per t-unit
and per sentence; dependent clauses per clause,
t-unit and sentence; co-ordinate phrases per
clause, t-unit and sentence; complex nominals per
clause and t-unit; noun phrases, verb phrases and
preposition phrases per sentence; average length
of NP, VP and PP; verb phrases per t-unit; SBARs
per sentence and average parse tree height.
We refer to the feature subset containing all
the traditionally used features (# char. per word,
# syll. per word and # words per sentence) as
TRADFEATURES in this paper.

4 The Readability Model
In computational linguistics, readability assess-
ment is generally approached as a classification
problem. To our knowledge, only Heilman et al
(2008) and Ma et al (2012a) experimented with
other kinds of statistical models.
We approach readability assessment as a regres-
sion problem. This produces a model which pro-
vides a continuous estimate of the reading level,
enabling us to see if there are documents that fall
between two levels or above the maximal level
found in the training data. We used the WEKA
implementation of linear regression for this pur-
pose. Since linear regression assumes that the data
falls on an interval scale with evenly spaced read-
ing levels, we used numeric values from 1?5 as
reading levels instead of the original class names
in the WeeBit corpus. Table 1 shows the mapping
from WeeBit classes to numeric values, along with
the age groups per class.
WeeBit class Age (years) Reading level
Level 2 7?8 1
Level 3 8?9 2
Level 4 9?10 3
KS3 11?14 4
GCSE 14?16 5
Table 1: WeeBit Reading Levels for Regression
We report Pearson?s correlation coefficient and
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as our evalua-
tion metrics. Correlation coefficient measures the
extent of linear relationship between two random
variables. In readability assessment, a high corre-
lation indicates that the texts at a higher difficulty
level are more likely to receive a higher level pre-
diction from the model and those at lower diffi-
culty level would more likely receive a lower pre-
diction. RMSE can be interpreted as the aver-
age deviation in grade levels between the predicted
and the actual values.
We trained four regression models with the fea-
ture subsets introduced in section 3: LEXFEA-
TURES, SYNFEATURES, TRADFEATURES and
ALLFEATURES. While the criterion used in cre-
ating the graded texts in WeeBit is not known, it
is likely that they were created with the traditional
measures in mind. Indeed, the traditional features
also were among the most predictive features in
Vajjala and Meurers (2012). Hence, apart from
61
training the above mentioned four regression mod-
els, we also trained a fifth model excluding the tra-
ditional features and formulae. This experiment
was performed to verify if the traditional features
are creating a skewed model that relies too heavily
on those well-known and thus easily manipulated
features in making decisions on test data. We refer
to this fifth feature group as NOTRAD.
Table 2 shows the result of our regression ex-
periments using 10-fold cross-validation on the
WeeBit corpus, employing the different feature
subsets and the complete feature set.
Feature Set # Features Corr. RMSE
LEXFEATURES 17 0.84 0.78
SYNFEATURES 25 0.88 0.64
TRADFEATURES 3 0.66 1.06
ALLFEATURES 42 0.92 0.54
NOTRAD 37 0.89 0.63
Table 2: Linear Regression Results for WeeBit
The best correlation of 0.92 was achieved with
the complete feature set. 0.92 is considered a
strong correlation and coupled with an RMSE of
0.54, we can conclude that our regression model
is a good model. In comparison, in Vajjala and
Meurers (2012), where we tackle readability as-
sessment as a classification problem, we obtained
93.3% accuracy on this dataset using all features.
Looking at the feature subsets, there also is a
good correlation between the model predictions
and the actual results in the other cases, except
for the model considering only traditional features.
While traditional features often are among the
most predictive features in readability research,
we also found that a model which does not include
them can perform at a comparable level (0.89).
Comparing these results with previous research
using regression modeling for readability assess-
ment is not particularly meaningful because of the
differences in the corpus and the levels used. For
example, while Heilman et al (2008) used a cor-
pus of 289 texts across 12 reading levels achieving
a correlation of 0.77, we used the WeeBit corpus
containing 3125 texts across 5 reading levels.6
We took the two best models of Table 2,
MODALL using ALLFEATURES and MODNO-
TRAD using the NOTRAD feature set, and set out
to answer our first guiding question, about the

man et al (2008), are not accessible due to copyright issues.
reading levels which such models can identify in a
systematic sample of web texts.
5 Applying readability models to web texts
To investigate the effect of the two readability
models for real-world web texts, we studied their
performance on two types of web data:
? web documents we crawled from specific
web sites that offer the same type of material
for two groups of readers differing in their
reading skills
? web documents identified by a web search
engine for a sample of web queries selected
from a public query log
5.1 Readability of web data drawn from
characteristic web sites
5.1.1 Web test sets used
Following the approach of Collins-Thompson and
Callan (2005) and Sato et al (2008), who eval-
uated readability models using independent web-
based test sets, we compiled three sets of web doc-
uments that given their origin can be classified into
two classes each:
Wiki ? SimpleWiki: Wikipedia7, along with its
manually simplified version Simple Wikipedia8 is
increasingly used in two-class readability classi-
fication tasks and text simplification approaches
(Napoles and Dredze, 2010; Zhu et al, 2010;
Coster and Kauchak, 2011). We use a collection
of 2000 randomly selected parallel articles from
each of the two websites, which in the following
is referred to as WIKI and SIMPLEWIKI.
Time ? Time for Kids: Time for Kids9 is a divi-
sion of the TIME magazine10, which produces ar-
ticles exclusively for children and is used widely
in classrooms. We took a sample of 2000 docu-
ments each from Time and from Time for Kids for
our experiments and refer them TIME and TFK.
NormalNews ? ChildrensNews: We crawled
websites that contain news articles written for chil-
dren (e.g., http://www.firstnews.co.uk) and
categorized them as CHILDRENSNEWS. We also
crawled freely accessible articles from popular
news websites such as BBC or The Guardian and
7http://en.wikipedia.org
8http://simple.wikipedia.org
9http://www.timeforkids.com
10http://www.time.com
62
categorized them as NORMALNEWS. We took
10K documents from each of these two categories
for our experiments.
These three corpus pairs collected as test cases
differ in several aspects. For example, Sim-
pleWikipedia is not targeting children as such,
whereas Time for Kids and ChildrensNews are.
And SimpleWikipedia ? Wikipedia covers paral-
lel articles in two versions, whereas this is not
the case for the the two Time and the two News
corpora. However, as far as we see these differ-
ences are orthogonal to the issue we are research-
ing here, namely their use as real-life test cases to
study the effect of the classification model learned
on the WeeBit data.
We applied the two regression models which
had performed best on the WeeBit corpus (cf. Ta-
ble 2 in section 4) to these web datasets. The aver-
age reading levels of the different datasets accord-
ing to these two models are reported in Table 3.

Distribution of reading levels across web texts with traditional features

Figure 1: Reading levels assigned by MODALL
the regular websites for adults (TIME, WIKI and
NORMALNEWS). However, there is an interesting
difference in the predictions made by the two mod-
els. The MODALL model including the traditional
features consistently assigns a higher reading level
to all the documents, and it also fails to separate
CHILDRENSNEWS (4.19) from WIKI (4.20).
To be able to inspect this in detail, we plot-
ted the class-wise reading level distribution of our
regression models. Figure 1 shows the distribu-
tion of reading levels for these web datasets using
MODALL. As we already knew from the averages,
the model assigns somewhat higher reading levels
to all documents, and the figure confirms that the
texts for children (SIMPLEWIKI, TFK and CHIL-
DRENSNEWS) are only marginally distinguished
from the corresponding websites targeting adult
readers (TIME,WIKI and NORMALNEWS). The
NORMALNEWS dataset alo seems to be placed
in a much higher distribution compared to all the
other test sets, with more than 50% of the docu-
ments getting a prediction of ?higher? (the label
used for documents placed at level 6 or higher).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of reading levels
across the test sets according to MODNOTRAD,
the model without traditional features. The model
provides a broader coverage across all reading lev-
els, with documents from children web sites and
SimpleWikipedia clearly being placed at the lower
end of the spectrum and web pages targeting adults
at the higher end. NORMALNEWS documents are
again placed the highest, but less than 10% fall
outside the range established by WeeBit. TIME
shows the highest diversity, with around 20% for
each reading level above the lowest one.

The first set of experiments shows that the
readability models which were successful on the
WeeBit reference corpus seem to be able to iden-
tify a corresponding broad range among web doc-
uments that we selected top-down by relying on
prototypical websites targeting ?adult? and ?child?
readers, which are likely to feature more difficult
and easier web documents, respectively. While
we cannot evaluate the difference between the two
models quantitatively, given the lack of an external
gold standard classification of the crawled data,
the MODNOTRAD conceptually seems to do a bet-
ter job at distinguishing the two classes of web-
sites in line with the top-down expectations.
5.2 Readability of search results
Complementing the first set of experiments, estab-
lishing that the readability models are capable of
placing web documents in line with the top-down
classification of the sites they originate from, in
the second set of experiments we want to investi-
gate bottom-up whether for some random topics of
interest, the web offers texts at different readabil-
ity levels. This also is of practical relevance, since
ranking web search results by readability is only
useful if there actually are documents at different
reading levels for a given query.
For this investigation, we took the MOD-
NOTRAD model and used it to estimate the
reading level of web search results. For
web searching, we used the BING search
API (http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/
bing/search) and computed the reading levels
of the Top-100 search results for a sample of 50
test queries, selected from a publicly accessible
database (Lu and Callan, 2003).
Figure 3 characterizes the data obtained through
the web searches in terms of the percentage of doc-
Figure 3: Documents retrieved per reading level
uments belonging to a given reading level, accord-
ing to the MODNOTRAD model. In the Top-100
search results obtained for each of the 50 queries,
the model identifies documents at all reading lev-
els, with a peak at reading level 4 (corresponding
to KS3 in the original WeeBit dataset).
To determine how much individual queries dif-
fer in terms of the readability of the documents
they retrieve, we also looked at the results for each
query separately. Figure 4 shows the mean read-
ing level of the Top-100 results for each of the 50
search queries. From query to query, the aver-
age readability of the documents retrieved seems
to differ relatively little, with most results falling
into the higher reading levels (4 or above).
Figure 4: Average reading level of search results
Returning to the question whether there are
documents of different reading levels for a given
query, we need to check how much variation exists
around the observed, rather similar averages. Ta-
ble 4 provides the individual reading levels of the
Top-10 search results for a sample of 10 queries
from our experiment, along with the average read-
ing level of the Top-100 results for that query. The
results in Table 4 indicate that indeed there are
documents at a broad range of reading levels even
among the most relevant search results returned by
the BING web search engine.
Looking at the individual query results, we
found that although a lot of news documents
tended towards a higher reading level, it is in-
deed possible to find some texts at lower read-
ing levels even within Top-10 results (indicated in
bold). However, we found that even for queries
that we would expect to result in hits from web-
sites targeting child readers, those sites often did
not make it into the Top-10 results. The same was
true for sites offering ?simple? language, such as
Simple Wikipedia, which was not among the top

results even when it contained pages directly rel-
evant to the query. To provide access to those
pages, reranking the search results based on read-
ability would thus be of value.
While we do not want to jump to conclusions
based on our sample of 50 queries, the results
of our experiments seem to support the idea that
readability-based re-ranking of web search results
can help users in accessing web documents that
also are at the right level for the given user. Re-
turning to the first overall question that lead us
here, our experiments support the answer that in-
deed there are documents spread across different
reading levels on the web with a tendency towards
higher reading levels.
6 Generalizability of the Feature Set
We can now turn to the second question raised in
the introduction: How well do the features gener-
alize across different classes of web documents?
We saw in section 5.1 that the predictions of the
two models we used varied quite a bit, solely
based on whether the traditional readability fea-
tures were included in the model or not. This con-
firms the need to investigate how generally appli-
cable which types of features are across datasets.
As far as we know, such an experiment vali-
dating the generalizability of features was not yet
performed in this domain. As there are no pub-
licly available graded web datasets to build new
readability models with the same feature set, we
used the datasets we introduced in section 5.1.1 for
creating two-class readability classification mod-
els. Since there are no clear age-group annota-
tions with all these datasets, we decided to use a
broad two-level classification instead of more fine
grained grade levels.
The difference between this experiment and the
previous one lies in the primary question it at-
tempts to answer. Here, the focus is on veri-
fying if the features are capable of building ac-
curate classification models on different training
sets. In the previous experiment, it was on check-
ing if a given classification model (which in that
experiment was trained on the WeeBit corpus) can
successfully discriminate reading levels for docu-
ments from various real-world texts.
We observed in Section 5.1 that with traditional
features, the WeeBit based readability model as-
signed higher reading levels to all the documents
from our web datasets. So, it would perhaps be
a natural step to train these binary classification
models excluding the traditional features. How-
ever, the traditional features may still be useful
(with different weights) for constructing classifi-
cation models with other training data. So, we
trained two sets of models per training set ? one
with ALLFEATURES and another excluding tradi-
tional features (NOTRAD).
We trained binary classification models using
the following training sets:
? TIME ? TFK texts
? WIKI ? SIMPLEWIKI texts
? NORMALNEWS ? KIDSNEWS texts
? TIME+WIKI ? TFK+SIMPLEWIKI texts
We used the Sequential Minimal Optimization
(SMO) algorithm implementation in the WEKA
tool kit to train these classifiers. The choice of
the algorithm here was motivated by the fact that
training is quick and that SMO has successfully
65
been used in previous research on readability as-
sessment (Feng, 2010; Hancke et al, 2012).
Table 5 summarizes the classification accura-
cies obtained with the four models using 10-fold
cross validation for the four web corpora.
Training Set Accuracy-All Accuracy-NoTrad
TIME ? TFK 95.11% 89.52%
WIKI ? SIMPLEWIKI 92.32% 88.81%
NORMALNEWS ? KIDSNEWS 97.93% 92.54%
TIME+WIKI ? TFK+SIMPLEWIKI 93.38% 89.72%
Table 5: Cross-validation accuracies for binary
classification on different web corpora
The results in the table show that the same set
of features consistently result in creating accu-
rate classification models for all four web corpora.
Each of the two-class classification models per-
formed well, despite the fact that the documents
were created by different people and most likely
with different instructions on how to write sim-
ple texts or simplify already existing texts. It was
interesting to note the role of traditional features
in improving the accuracy of these binary classi-
fication models. But, in the previous experiment,
the model with traditional features consistently put
all the documents into higher reading levels. It is
possible that the role of traditional features in the
WeeBit corpus may be skewed as it is likely that it
was prepared with traditional readability measures
in mind. Contrasting the results of these two ex-
periments raises the question of what features hold
more weight in what dataset, which is an interest-
ing issue to explore in the future.
In sum, this experiment provides some clear
evidence for affirmatively answering the second
question about the generalizability of the feature
set we used. The features seem to be sufficiently
general for them to be useful in performing read-
ability assessment of real-world documents.
7 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, we set out to investigate the appli-
cability and generalizability of readability models
for real-world web texts. We started with build-
ing readability models using linear regression, on
a 5-level readability corpus with a range of lexi-
cal and syntactic features (section 4). We applied
the two best models thus obtained to several web
datasets we compiled from websites targeting chil-
dren and others designed for adults (section 5.1)
and on the Top-100 results obtained using a stan-
dard web search engine (section 5.2).
We observed that the models identified texts
across a broad range of reading levels in the web
corpora. Our pilot study of the reading levels of
the search results confirmed that readability mod-
els could be useful as re-ranking or filtering pa-
rameters that prioritize relevant results which are
at the right level for a given user. At the same
time, we observed in both these experiments that
the average reading level of general web articles
is relatively high according to our models. Apart
from result ranking, this also calls for the construc-
tion of efficient text simplification systems which
pick up the difficult texts and attempt to simplify
them to a given reading level.
We then proceeded to investigate how well
the features used to build these readability mod-
els generalize across different corpora. For this,
we reused the corpora with articles for children
and adult readers from prototypical websites (sec-
tion 5.1.1) and built four binary classification
models with all of the readability features (sec-
tion 6). Each of the models achieved good clas-
sification accuracies, supporting that the broad
feature set used generalizes well across corpora.
Whether or not to use traditional readability fea-
tures is somewhat difficult to answer since those
formulae are often taken into account when writ-
ing materials, so high classification accuracy on
such corpora may be superficial in that it is not
necessarily indicative of the spectrum of texts
found on the web (section 5.1). This also raises
the more general question which features work
best for which kind of dataset. A systematic ex-
ploration of the effect of the individual features
along with the impact of document topic and genre
on readability would be interesting and relevant to
pursue in the future.
In our future work, we also intend to explore
further features for this task and improve our un-
derstanding of the correlations between the differ-
ent features. Finally, we are considering reformu-
lating readability assessment as ordinal regression
or preference ranking.
