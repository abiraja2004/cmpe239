Abstract. We propose a method for labelling prepositional phrases ac-
cording to two different semantic role classifications, as contained in the
Penn treebank and the CoNLL 2004 Semantic Role Labelling data set.
Our results illustrate the difficulties in determining preposition seman-
tics, but also demonstrate the potential for PP semantic role labelling to
improve the performance of a holistic semantic role labelling system.
1 Introduction
Prepositional phrases (PPs) are both common and semantically varied in open
English text. Learning the semantics of prepositions is not a trivial task in gen-
eral. It may seem that the semantics of a given PP can be predicted with rea-
sonable reliability independent of its context. However, it is actually common for
prepositions or even identical PPs to exhibit a wide range of semantic fuctions
in different open English contexts. For example, consider the PP to the car : this
PP will generally occur as a directional adjunct (e.g. walk to the car), but it can
also occur as an object to the verb (e.g. refer to the car) or contrastive argu-
ment (e.g. the default mode of transport has shifted from the train to the car); to
further complicate the situation, in key to the car it functions as a complement
to the N-bar key. Based on this observation, we may consider the possibility of
constructing a semantic tagger specifically for PPs, which uses the surrounding
context of the PP to arrive at a semantic analysis. It is this task of PP semantic
role labelling that we target in this paper.
A PP semantic role labeller would allow us to take a document and identify
all adjunct PPs with their semantics. We would expect this to include a large
portion of locative and temporal expressions, e.g., in the document, providing
valuable data for tasks such as information extraction and question answering.
Indeed our initial foray into PP semantic role labelling relates to an interest in
geospatial and temporal analysis, and the realisation of the importance of PPs
in identifying and classifying spatial and temporal references.
The contributions of this paper are to propose a method for PP semantic role
labelling, and evaluate its performance over both the Penn treebank (including
comparative evaluation with previous work) and also the data from the CoNLL
Semantic Role Labelling shared task. As part of this process, we identify the

2 Preposition Semantic Role Disambiguation in Penn
Treebank
Significant numbers of prepositional phrases (PPs) in the Penn treebank [1] are
tagged with their semantic role relative to the governing verb. For example,
Figure 1, shows a fragment of the parse tree for the sentence [Japan?s reserves
of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights] fell by a hefty
$1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion [the Finance Ministry said], in which
the three PPs governed by the verb fell are tagged as, respectively: PP-EXT
(?extend?), meaning how much of the reserve fell; PP-TMP (?temporal?), meaning
when the reserve fell; and PP-DIR (?direction?), meaning the direction of the fall.
According to our analysis, there are 143 preposition semantic roles in the tree-
bank. However, many of these semantic roles are very similar to one another;
for example, the following semantic roles were found in the treebank: PP-LOC,
PP-LOC-1, PP-LOC-2, PP-LOC-3, PP-LOC-4, PP-LOC-5, PP-LOC-CLR, PP-
LOC-CLR-2, PP-LOC-CLR-TPC-1. Inspection of the data revealed no systematic
semantic differences between these PP types. Indeed, for most PPs, it was im-
possible to distinguish the subtypes of a given superclass (e.g. PP-LOC in our
example). We therefore decided to collapse the PP semantic roles based on their
first semantic feature. For example, all semantic roles that start with PP-LOC
are collapsed to the single class PP-LOC. Table 1 shows the distribution of the
collapsed preposition semantic roles.
[2] describe a system1 for disambiguating the semantic roles of prepositions in
the Penn treebank according to 7 basic semantic classes. In their system, O?Hara
and Weibe used a decision tree classifier, and the following types of features:
? POS tags of surrounding tokens: The POS tags of the tokens before and
after the target preposition within a predefined window size. In O?Hara and
Wiebe?s work, this window size is 2.
1 This system was trained with WEKA?s J48 decision tree implementation.

? Word collocation: All the words in the same sentence as the target prepo-
sition; each word is treated as a binary feature.
? Hypernym collocation: The WordNet hypernyms [3] of the open class
words before and after the target preposition within a predefined window
size (set to 5 words); each hypernym is treated as a binary feature.
O?Hara and Wiebe?s system also performs the following pre-classification
filtering on the collocation features:
? Frequency constraint: f(coll) > 1, where coll is either a word from the
word collocation or a hypernym from the hypernym collocation
? Conditional independence threshold: p(c|coll)?p(c)p(c) >= 0.2, where c is a
particular semantic role and coll is from the word collocation or a hypernym
from the hypernym collocation
We began our research by replicating O?Hara and Wiebe?s method and seek-
ing ways to improve it. Our initial investigation revealed that there were around
44000 word and hypernym collocation features even after the frequency con-
straint filter and the conditional independence filter have been applied. We did
not believe all these collocation features were necessary, and we deployed an ad-
ditional ranking-based filtering mechanism over the collocation features to only
select collocation features which occur in the top N frequency bins. Algorithm 1
shows the details of this filtering mechanism.
This ranking-based filtering mechanism allows us to select collocation feature
sets of differing size, and in doing so not only improve the training and tagging

of collocation features affects the performance of the PP semantic role labeller
and which collocation features are more important.
2.1 Results
Since some of the preposition semantic roles in the treebank have extremely low
frequencies, we decided to build our first classifier using only the top 9 seman-
tic roles, as detailed in Table 1. We also noticed that the semantic roles PP-CLR,
PP-CD and PP-PUT were excluded from O?Hara?s system which only used PP-BNF,
PP-EXT, PP-MNR, PP-TMP, PP-DIR, PP-LOC and PP-PRP, therefore we built a sec-
ond classifier using only the semantic roles used by O?Hara?s system2. The two
classifiers were trained with a maximum entropy [4] learner3.
Table 2 shows the results of our classifier under stratified 10-fold cross val-
idation4 using different parameters for the rank-based filter. We also list the
accuracy reported by O?Hara and Wiebe for comparison.
The results show that the performance of the classifier increases as we add
more collocation features. However, this increase is not linear, and the improve-
ment of performance is only marginal when the number collocation features is
greater than 100. It also can be observed that there is a consistent performance
difference between classifiers 1 and 2, which may suggest that PP-CLR may be
harder to distinguish from other semantic roles. This is not totally surprising
given the relatively vague definition of the semantics of PP-CLR. We return to
analyse these results in greater depth in Section 4.

whether we could use the same feature set to perform PP semantic role labelling
over alternate systems of PP classification. We chose the 2004 CoNLL Semantic
Role Labelling (SRL) dataset [5] because it contained a wide range of semantic
classes of PPs, in part analogous to the Penn treebank data, and also because
we wished to couple our method with a holistic SRL system to demonstrate the
ability of PP semantic role labelling to enhance overall system performance.
Since the focus of the CoNLL data is on SRL relative to a set of pre-
determined verbs for each sentence input,5 our primary objective is to inves-
tigate whether the performance of SRL systems in general can be improved in
any way by an independent preposition SRL system. We achieve this by embed-
ding our PP classification method within an existing holistic SRL system?that
is a system which attempts to tag all semantic role types in the CoNLL 2004
data?through the following three steps:
1. Perform SRL on each preposition in the CoNLL dataset;
2. Merge the output of the preposition SRL with the output of a given verb
SRL system over the same dataset;
3. Perform standard CoNLL SRL evaluation over the merged output.
The details of preposition SRL and combination with the output of a holistic
SRL system are discussed below.
3.1 Breakdown of the Preposition Semantic Role Labelling Problem
Preposition semantic role labelling over the CoNLL dataset is considerably more
complicated than the task of disambiguating preposition semantic roles in the
Penn treebank. There are three separate subtasks which are required to perform
preposition SRL:
1. PP Attachment: determining which verb to attach each preposition to.
2. Preposition Semantic Role Disambiguation
3. Argument Segmentation: determining the boundaries of the semantic
roles.
The three subtasks are not totally independent of each other, as we demon-
strate in the results section, and improved performance over one of the subtasks
does not necessarily correlate with an improvement in the final results.
3.2 PP Attachment Classification
PP attachment (PPA) classification is the first step of preposition semantic role
labelling and involves determining the verb attachment site for a given prepo-
sition, i.e. which of the pre-identified verbs in the sentence the preposition is
5 Note that the CoNLL 2004 data identifies certain verbs as having argument struc-
ture, and that the semantic role annotation is relative to these verbs only. This is
often not the sum total of all verbs in a given sentence: the verbs in relative clauses,
e.g., tend not to be identified as having argument structure.

governed by. Normally, this task would be performed by a parser. However, since
the CoNLL dataset contains no parsing information6 and we did not want to use
any resources not explicitly provided in the CoNLL data, we had to construct a
PPA classifier to specifically perform this task.
This classifier uses the following features, all of which are derived from infor-
mation provided in the CoNLL data:
? POS tags of surrounding tokens: The POS tags of the tokens before and
after the target preposition within a window size of 2 tokens ([?2, 2]).
? POS tag of the target preposition
? The target preposition
? Verbs and their relative position (VerbRelPos): All the (pre-
identified) verbs in the same sentence as the target preposition and their
relative positions to the preposition are extracted as features. Each (verb,
relative position) tuple is treated as a binary feature. The relative positions
are determined in a way such that the 1st verb before the preposition will
be given the position ?1, the 2nd verb before the preposition will be given
the position ?2, and so on.
? The type of the clause containing the target preposition
? Neighbouring chunk type: The types (NP, PP, VP, etc.) of chunks before
and after the target preposition within a window of 3 chunks.
? Word collocation (WordColl): All the open class words in the phrases
before and after the target preposition within a predefined window of 3
chunks.
? Hypernym collocation (HyperColl): All the hypernyms from the open
class words in the phrases before and after the target preposition within a
predefined window of 3 chunks.
? Named Entity collocation NEColl: All the named entity information
from the phrases before and after the target preposition within a predefined
window of 3 chunks.
The PPA classifier outputs the relative position of the governing verb to the
target preposition, or None if the preposition does not have a semantic role.
We trained the PPA classifier over the CoNLL 2004 training set, and tested it
on the testing set. Table 3 shows the distribution of the classes in the testing set.
The same maximum entropy learner used in the treebank SRL task was used
to train the PPA classifier. The accuracy of this classifier on the CoNLL 2004
testing set is 78.99%.
3.3 Preposition Semantic Role Disambiguation
For the task of preposition semantic role disambiguation (SRD), we constructed
a classifier using the same features as the PPA classifier, with the following
differences:
6 The CoNLL 2005 SRL data does contain parse trees for the sentences, possibly
obviating the need for independent verb attachment classification.

2. The window sizes for the WordColl, the HyperColl and the NeColl fea-
tures are set to include the entire sentence.
We trained the SRD classifier once again on the CoNLL 2004 training set,
and tested it on the testing set. Table 4 shows the distribution of the classes in
the testing set.
We used the same maximum entropy leaner as for the PPA classifier to train
the SRD classifier. The accuracy of the SRD classifier on the CoNLL 2004 testing
set is 58.68%.
3.4 Argument Segmentation
In order to determine the extent of each NP selected for by a given preposition
(i.e. the span of words contained in the NP), we use a simple regular expression
over the chunk parser analysis of the sentence provided in the CoNLL 2004 data,
786 P. Ye and T. Baldwin
namely: PP NP+. We additionally experimented with a robust statistical parser
[6] to determine PP extent, but found that the regular expression-based method
performed equally well or marginally better, without requiring any resources
external to the original task data.
We make no attempt to perform separate evaluation of this particular subtask
because without the semantic role information, no direct comparison can be
made with the CoNLL data.
3.5 Combining the Output of the Subtasks
Once we have identified the association between verbs and prepositions, and dis-
ambiguated the semantic roles of the prepositions, we can begin the process of cre-
ating the final output of the preposition semantic role labelling system. This takes
place by identifying the data column corresponding to the verb governing each
classified PP in the CoNLL data format (as determined by the PPA classifier),
and recording the semantic role of that PP (as determined by the SRD classifier)
over the full extent of the PP (as determined by the segmentation classifier).
3.6 Merging the Output of Preposition SRL and Verb SRL
Once we have generated the output of the preposition SRL system, we can
proceed to the final stage where the semantic roles of the prepositions are merged
with the semantic roles of an existing holistic SRL system.
It is possible, and indeed likely, that the semantic roles produced by the two
systems will conflict in terms of overlap in the extent of labelled constituents
and/or the semantic role labelling of constituents. To address any such conflicts,
we designed three merging strategies to identify the right balance between the
outputs of the two component systems:
S1 When a conflict is encountered, only use the semantic role information from
the holistic SRL system.
S2 When a conflict is encountered, if the start positions of the semantic role
are the same for both SRL systems, then replace the semantic role of the
holistic SRL system with that of the preposition SRL system, but keep the
holistic SRL system?s boundary end.
S3 When a conflict is encountered, only use the semantic role information from
the preposition SRL system.
3.7 Results
To evaluate the performance of our preposition SRL system, we combined its
outputs with the 3 top-performing holistic SRL systems from the CoNLL 2004
SRL shared task.7 The three systems are [7], [8] and [9]. Furthermore, in order
to establish the upper bound of the improvement of preposition SRL on verb

SRL, and investigate how the three subtasks interact with each other and what
their respective limits are, we also used oracled outputs from each subtask in
combining the final outputs of the preposition SRL system. The oracled outputs
are what would be produced by perfect classifiers, and are emulated by inspection
of the gold-standard annotations for the testing data.
Table 5 shows the results of the preposition SRL systems before they are

in the testing data, even when oracled outputs from all three subsystems are
used (recall = 18.15%). However, this is not surprising because we expected the
majority of semantic roles to be noun phrases.
In Tables 6, 7 and 8, we show how our preposition SRL system performs
when merged with the top 3 systems under the 3 merging strategies introduced
in Section 3.6. In each table, ORIG refers to the base system without preposition
SRL merging.
We can make a few observations from the results of the merged systems.
First, out of verb attachment, SRD and segmentation, the SRD module is both:
(a) the component with the greatest impact on overall performance, and (b)
the component with the greatest differential between the oracle performance
and classifier (AUTO) performance. This would thus appear to be the area in
which future efforts should be concentrated in order to boost the performance
of holistic SRLs through preposition SRL.
Second, the results show that in most cases, the recall of the merged system is
higher than that of the original SRL system. This is not surprising given that we
are generally relabelling or adding information to the argument structure of each
verb, although with the more aggressive merging strategies (namely S2 and S3)
it sometimes happens that recall drops, by virtue of the extent of an argument
being aversely affected by relabelling. It does seem to point to a complementarity
between verb-driven SRL and preposition-specific SRL, however.
Finally, it was somewhat disappointing to see that in no instance did a fully-
automated method surpass the base system in precision or F-score. Having said
this, we were encouraged by the size of the margin between the base systems and
the fully oracle-based systems, as it supports our base hypothesis that preposi-
tion SRL has the potential to boost the performance of holistic SRL systems,
up to a margin of 10% in F-score for S3.
4 Analysis and Discussion
In the previous 2 sections, we presented the methodologies and results of two
systems that perform statistical analysis on the semantics of prepositions, each
Semantic Role Labelling of Prepositional Phrases 789
using a different data set. The performance of the 2 systems was very differ-
ent. The SRD system trained on the treebank produced highly credible results,
whereas the SRL system trained on CoNLL 2004 SRL data set produced some-
what negative results. In the remainder of this section, we will analyze these
results and discuss their significance.
There is a significant difference between the results obtained by the tree-
bank classifier and that obtained by the CoNLL SRL classifier. In fact, even
with a very small number of collocation features, the treebank classifier still
outperformed the CoNLL SRL classifier. This suggests that the semantic tag-
ging of prepositions is somewhat artificial. This is evident in three ways. First,
the proportion of prepositional phrases tagged with semantic roles is small ?
around 57,000 PPs out of the million-word Treebank corpus. This small pro-
portion suggests that the preposition semantic roles were tagged only in cer-
tain prototypical situations. Second, we were able to achieve reasonably high
results even when we used a collocation feature set with fewer than 200 fea-
tures. This further suggests that the semantic roles were tagged for only a small
number of verbs in relatively fixed situations. Third, the preposition SRD sys-
tem for the CoNLL data set used a very similar feature set to the treebank
system, but was not able to produce anywhere near comparable results. Since
the CoNLL dataset is aimed at holistic SRL across all argument types, it in-
corporates a much larger set of verbs and tagging scenarios; as a result, the
semantic role labelling of PPs is far more heterogeneous and realistic than is
the case in the treebank. Therefore, we conclude that the results of our tree-
bank preposition SRD system are not very meaningful in terms of predict-
ing the success of the method at identifying and semantically labelling PPs
in open text.
A few interesting facts came out of the results over the CoNLL dataset. The
most important one is that by using an independent preposition SRL system,
the results of a general verb SRL system can be significantly boosted. This
is evident because when the oracled results of all three subtasks were used, the
merged results were around 10% higher than those for the original systems, in all
three cases. Unfortunately, it was also evident from the results that we were not
successful in automating preposition SRL. Due to the strictness of the CoNLL
evaluation, it was not always possible to achieve a better overall performance
by improving just one of the three subsystems. For example, in some cases,
worse results were achieved by using the oracled results for PPA, and the results
produced by SRD classifier than using the PPA classifier and the SRD classifiers
in conjunction. The reason for the worse results is that in our experiments, the
oracled PPA always identifies more prepositions attached to verbs than the PPA
classifier, therefore more prepositions will be given semantic roles by the SRD
classifier. However, since the performance of the SRD classifier is not high, and
the segmentation subsystem does not always produce the same semantic role
boundaries as the CoNLL data set, most of these additional prepositions would
either be given a wrong semantic role or wrong phrasal extent (or both), thereby
causing the overall performance to fall.

Finally, it is evident that the merging strategy also plays an important role
in determining the performance of the merged preposition SRL and verb SRL
systems: when the performance of the preposition SRL system is high, a more
preposition-oriented merging scheme would produce better overall results, and
vice versa.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have proposed a method for labelling preposition semantics and
deployed the method over two different data sets involving preposition semantics.
We have shown that preposition semantics is not a trivial problem in general,
and also that has the potential to complement other semantic analysis tasks,
such as semantic role labelling.
Our analysis of the results of the preposition SRL system shows that sig-
nificant improvement in all three stages of preposition semantic role labelling?
namely verb attachment, preposition semantic role disambiguation and argu-
ment segmentation?must be achieved before preposition SRL can make a sig-
nificant contribution to holistic SRL. The unsatisfactory results of our CoNLL
preposition SRL system show that the relatively simplistic feature sets used in
our research are far from sufficient. Therefore, we will direct our future work
towards using additional NLP tools, information repositories and feature engi-
neering to improve all three stages of preposition semantic role labelling.
