Abstract 
Reordering is pre-processing stage for Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) system where 
the words of the source sentence are re-
ordered as per the syntax of the target lan-
guage. We are proposing a rich set of rules for 
better reordering. The idea is to facilitate the 
training process by better alignments and par-
allel phrase extraction for a phrase based SMT 
system.  Reordering also helps the decoding 
process and hence improving the machine 
translation quality. We have observed signifi-
cant improvements in the translation quality 
by using our approach over the baseline SMT. 
We have used BLEU, NIST, multi-reference 
word error rate, multi-reference position inde-
pendent error rate for judging the improve-
ments. We have exploited open source SMT 
toolkit MOSES to develop the system.   
1 Introduction 
This paper describes syntactic reordering rules to 
reorder English sentences as per the Hindi lan-
guage structure. Generally in reordering ap-
proach, the source sentence is parsed(E) and syn-
tactic reordering rules are applied to form reor-
dered sentence(E`). The training of SMT system 
is performed using parallel corpus having source 
side reordered(E`) and target side. The decoding 
is done by supplying reordered source sentences. 
The source sentences prior to decoding are reor-
dered using the same syntactic rules as applied 
for the training data. So, this process works as a 
preprocessing stage for the phrase-based SMT 
system. It has been observed that reordering as a 
pre-processing stage is beneficial for developing 
English-Hindi phrase based SMT system (Rama-
nathan et al, 2008; Rama et al, 2008). This pa-
per describes a rich set of rules for the structural 
transformation of English sentence to Hindi lan-
guage structure using Stanford (De et al, 2006) 
parse tree on source side. These rules are manu-
ally extracted based on analysis of source sen-
tence tree and Hindi translation. 
For the evaluation purpose we have trained 
and evaluated three different phrase based SMT 
systems using MOSES toolkit (Koehn et al 
2007) and GIZA++(Och and Ney, 2003). The 
first system was non-reordered baseline (Brown 
et al, 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et 
al., 2003), second using limited reordering de-
scribed in Ramanathan et al (2008) and third 
using improved reordering technique proposed in 
the paper. Evaluation has been carried out for 
end to end English-Hindi translation outputs us-
ing BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2001), NIST 
score (Doddington, 2002), multi-reference posi-
tion-independent word error rate (Tillmann et al, 
1997), multi-reference word error rate (Nie?en et 
al., 2000). We have observed improvement in 
each of these evaluation metrics used. Next sec-
tion discusses related work. Section 3 describes 
our reordering approach followed by experi-
ments and results in section 4 and conclusion in 
section 5. 
2 Related Work 
Various pre-processing approaches have been 
proposed for handling syntax within SMT sys-
tems. These proposed methods reconcile the 
word-order differences between the source and 
target language sentences by reordering the 
source prior to the SMT training and decoding 
stages. For English-Hindi statistical machine 
translation reordering approach is used by Ra-
manathan et al (2008) and Rama et al (2008). 
This approach (Ramanathan et al 2008) has 
shown significant improvements over baseline 
(Brown et al, 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; 
Koehn et al, 2003). The BLEU score for the sys-
tem has increased from 12.10 to 16.90 after reor-
dering. The same reordering approach (Rama-
nathan et al, 2008) used by us has shown slight 
improvement in BLEU score of 0.64 over base-
line i.e. BLEU score increased from 21.55 to 
34
22.19 compare to +4.8 BLEU point increase in 
the previous case. The reason can be, when the 
system is able to get bigger chunks from the 
phrase table itself the local reordering (within 
phrase) is not needed and the long distance reor-
dering employed in the earlier approach will be 
helpful for overall better translation. It may not 
be able to show significant improvements when 
local reordering is not captured by the translation 
model.    
Other language pairs have also shown signifi-
cant improvement when reordering is employed. 
Xia and Mc-Cord (2004) have observed im-
provement for French-English and Chao et al 
(2007) for Chinese-English language pairs. 
Nie?en and Ney (2004) have proposed sentence 
restructuring whereas Collins et al (2005) have 
proposed clause restructuring to improve Ger-
man-English SMT. Popovic and Ney (2006) 
have also reported the use of simple local trans-
formation rules for Spanish-English and Serbian-
English translation. 
Recently, Khalilov and Fonollosa (2011) pro-
posed a reordering technique using deterministic 
approach for long distance reordering and non-
deterministic approach for short distance reorder-
ing exploiting morphological information. Some 
reordering approaches are also presented exploit-
ing the SMT itself (Gupta et al, 2012; Dlougach 
and Galinskaya, 2012).     
Various evaluation techniques are available 
for reordering and overall machine translation 
evaluation. Particularly for reordering Birch and 
Osborne (2010) have proposed LRScore, a lan-
guage independent metric for evaluating the lexi-
cal and word reordering quality. The translation 
evaluation metrics include BLEU (Papineni et. 
al., 2002), Meteor (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), 
NIST (Doddington, 2002), etc. 
3 Reordering approach  
Our reordering approach is based on syntactic 
transformation of the English sentence parse tree 
according to the target language (Hindi) struc-
ture. It is similar to Ramanathan et al (2008) but 
the transformation rules are not restricted to 
?SVO to SOV? and ?pre-modifier to post-
modifier? transformations only.  
The idea was to come up with generic syntac-
tic transformation rules to match the target lan-
guage grammatical structure. The motivation 
came from the fact that if words are already in a 
correct place with respect to other words in the 
sentence, system doesn?t need to do the extra 
work of reordering at the decoding time. This 
problem becomes even more complicated when 
system doesn?t able to get bigger phrases for 
translating a sentence. Assuming an 18 words 
sentence, if system is able to get only 2 word 
length phrases, there are 362880(9!) translations 
(permutations) possible (still ignoring the case 
where one phrase having more than one transla-
tion options) for a sentence.  
The source and the target sentences are manu-
ally analyzed to derive the tree transformation 
rules. From the generated set of rules we have 
selected rules which seemed to be more generic. 
There are cases where we have found more than 
one possible correct transformations for an Eng-
lish sentence as the target language (Hindi) is a 
free word order language within certain limits. In 
such cases word order close to English structure 
is preferred over possible word orders with re-
spect to Hindi. 
We identified 5 categories which are most 
prominent candidates for reordering. These in-
clude VPs (verb phrases), NPs (noun phrases), 
ADJPs (adjective phrase), PPs (preposition 
phrase) and ADVPs (adverb phrase). In the fol-
lowing subsections, we have described rules for 
these in more detail.

Table 1: Tag description 
 
The format for writing the rules is as follows: 
Type_of_phrase(tag1 tag2 tag 3: tag2 tag1 tag3) 
35
This means that ?tag1 tag2 tag3?, structure 
has been transformed to ?tag2 tag1 tag3? for the 
type_of_phrase. This type_of_phrase denotes our 
category (NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP, PP) in which 
rule fall. The table given above explains about 
various tags and corresponding Penn tags used in 
writing these rules. 
The following subsections explain the reorder-
ing rules. The higher precedence rule is written 
prior to the lower precedence. In general the 
more specific rules have high precedence. Each 
rule is followed by an example with intermediate 
steps of parsing and transformation as per the 
Hindi sentence structure. ?Partial Reordered? 
shows the effect of the particular rule whereas 
?Reordered? shows impact of the whole reorder-
ing approach. The Hindi (transliterated) sentence 
is also provided as a reference for the corre-
sponding English sentence.

The baseline system was setup by using the 
phrase-based model (Brown et al, 1990; Marcu 
and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al, 2003). For the 
language model, we carried out experiments and 
found on comparison that 5-gram model with 
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and 
Goodman, 1998) to be the best performing. Tar-
get Hindi corpus from the training set was used 
for creating the language model. The KenLM 
(Heafield., 2011) toolkit was used for the lan-
guage modeling experiments. The tuning corpus 
was used to set weights for the language models, 
distortion model, phrase translation model etc. 
using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003). 
Decoding was performed using the MOSES de-
coder. Stanford constituency parser (De et al, 
2006) was used for parsing. 
Table 2 above describes with the help of an 
example how the reordering and hence the trans-
lation quality has improved. From the example it 
can be seen that the translation by system using 
our approach is better than the other two sys-
tems. The output translation is structurally more 
correct in our approach and conveys the same 
meaning with respect to the reference translation.

Table 4: Phrase count analysis 
 
The Table 5 below lists four different evalua-
tions of the systems under study. For BLEU and 
NIST higher score is considered as better and for 
mWER and mPER  lower score is desirable. Ta-
ble 5 shows the results of comparative evaluation 
of baseline, limited reordering and our approach 
with improved reordering. We find that addition 
of more reordering rules show substantial im-
provements over the baseline phrase based sys-
tem and the limited reordering system (Rama-
nathan et al, 2008). The impact of improved 
syntactic reordering can be seen as the BLEU 
and NIST scores have increased whereas mWER 
and mPER scores have decreased.

Table 5: Evaluation scores 
 
Table 4 above shows the count of overall 
phrases and distinct phrases (distinct on source) 
for baseline, limited reordering approach and our 
improved reordering approach. The table also 
shows increase over baseline (IOBL) and per-
centage increase over baseline(%IOBL) for lim-
ited reordering and improved reordering. We 
have observed that no. of distinct phrases ex-
tracted from the training corpus get increased. 
The %IOBL for bigger phrases is more compare 
to shorter phrases. This can be attributed to the 
better alignments resulting in extraction of more 
phrases (Koehn et al, 2003).  
We have also observed that the overall in-
crease is even lesser than the increase in no. of 
distinct phrases (distinct on source) for all the 
phrase-lengths in our approach (e.g. 42613 and 
45405 for phrase-length 2) which shows that re-
ordering makes word alignments more consistent 
and reduces multiple entries for the same source 
phrase. The training was done on maximum 
phrase-length 7(default).   
5 Conclusion  
It can be seen that addition of more reordering 
rules improve translation quality. As of now we 
have tried these rules only for English-Hindi 
pair, but the plan is to employ similar reordering 
rules in other English-Indian language pairs as 
most Indian languages are structurally similar to 
Hindi. Also plans are there to go for comparative 
study of improved reordering system and hierar-
chical model.
