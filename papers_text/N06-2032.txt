Abstract
In this paper, we present results from a
Broadcast News story segmentation sys-
tem developed for the SRI NIGHTIN-
GALE system operating on English, Ara-
bic and Mandarin news shows to provide
input to subsequent question-answering
processes. Using a rule-induction algo-
rithm with automatically extracted acous-
tic and lexical features, we report success
rates that are competitive with state-of-
the-art systems on each input language.
We further demonstrate that features use-
ful for English and Mandarin are not dis-
criminative for Arabic.
1 Introduction
Broadcast News (BN) shows typically include
multiple unrelated stories, interspersed with anchor
presentations of headlines and commercials. Tran-
sitions between each story are frequently marked
by changes in speaking style, speaker participation,
and lexical choice. Despite receiving a consider-
able amount of attention through the Spoken Doc-
ument Retrieval (SDR), Topic Detection and Track-
ing (TDT), and Text Retrieval Conference: Video
(TRECVID) research programs, automatic detec-
tion of story boundaries remains an elusive prob-
lem. State-of-the-art story segmentation error rates
on English and Mandarin BN remain fairly high and
Arabic is largely unstudied. The NIGHTINGALE
system searches a diverse news corpus to return an-
swers to user queries. For audio sources, the iden-
tification of story boundaries is crucial, to segment
material to be searched and to provide interpretable
results to the user.
2 Related work
Previous approaches to story segmentation have
largely focused lexical features, such as word sim-
ilarily (Kozima, 1993), cue phrases (Passonneau
and Litman, 1997), cosine similarity of lexical win-
dows (Hearst, 1997; Galley et al, 2003), and adap-
tive language modeling (Beeferman et al, 1999).
Segmentation of stories in BN have included some
acoustic features (Shriberg et al, 2000; Tu?r et al,
2001). Work on non-English BN, generally use
this combination of lexical and acoustic measures,
such as (Wayne, 2000; Levow, 2004) on Mandarin.
And (Palmer et al, 2004) report results from feature
selection experiments that include Arabic sources,
though they do not report on accuracy. TRECVID
has also identified visual cues to story segmentation
of video BN (cf. (Hsu et al, 2004; Hsieh et al, 2003;
Chaisorn et al, 2003; Maybury, 1998)).
3 The NIGHTINGALE Corpus
The training data used for NIGHTINGALE in-
cludes the TDT-4 and TDT5 corpora (Strassel and
Glenn, 2003; Strassel et al, 2004). TDT-4 in-
cludes newswire text and broadcast news audio
in English, Arabic and Mandarin; TDT-5 contains
only text data, and is therefore not used by our
system. The TDT-4 audio corpus includes 312.5
hours of English Broadcast News from 450 shows,
88.5 hours of Arabic news from 109 shows, and
134 hours of Mandarin broadcasts from 205 shows.
This material was drawn from six English news
shows ? ABC ?World News Tonight?, CNN ?Head-
line News?, NBC ?Nightly News?, Public Radio
International ?The World?, MS-NBC ?News with
Brian Williams?, and Voice of America, English
three Mandarin newscasts ? China National Ra-
dio, China Television System, and Voice of Amer-
ica, Mandarin Chinese ? and two Arabic newscasts
? Nile TV and Voice of America, Modern Standard
Arabic. All of these shows aired between Oct. 1,
2000 and Jan. 31, 2001.
4 Our Features and Approach
Our story segmentation system procedure is es-
sentially one of binary classification, trained on a
variety of acoustic and lexical cues to the presence
or absence of story boundaries in BN. Our classi-
fier was trained using the JRip machine learning al-
125
gorithm, a Java implementation of the RIPPER al-
gorithm of (Cohen, 1995).1 All of the cues we
use are automatically extracted. We use as input
to our classifier three types of automatic annotation
produced by other components of the NIGHTIN-
GALE system, speech recognition (ASR) transcrip-
tion, speaker diarization, sentence segmentation.
Currently, we assume that story boundaries occur
only at these hypothesized sentence boundaries. For
our English corpus, this assumption is true for only
47% of story boundaries; the average reference story
boundary is 9.88 words from an automatically rec-
ognized sentence boundary2 . This errorful input im-
mediately limits our overall performance.
For each such hypothesized sentence boundary,
we extract a set of features based on the previous
and following hypothesized sentences. The classi-
fier then outputs a prediction of whether or not this
sentence boundary coincides with a story boundary.
The features we use for story boundary prediction
are divided into three types: lexical, acoustic and
speaker-dependent.
The value of even errorful lexical information in
identifying story boundaries has been confirmed for
many previous story segmentation systems (Beefer-
man et al, 1999; Stokes, 2003)). We include some
previously-tested types of lexical features in our own
system, as well as identifying our own ?cue-word?
features from our training corpus. Our lexical fea-
tures are extracted from ASR transcripts produced
by the NIGHTINGALE system. They include lexi-
cal similarity scores calculated from the TextTiling
algorithm.(Hearst, 1997), which determines the lex-
ical similarity of blocks of text by analyzing the co-
sine similarity of a sequence of sentences; this al-
gorithm tests the likelihood of a topic boundary be-
tween blocks, preferring locations between blocks
which have minimal lexical similarity. For En-
glish, we stem the input before calculating these fea-
tures, using an implementation of the Porter stem-
mer (Porter, 1980); we have not yet attempted to
identify root forms for Mandarin or Arabic. We also
calculate scores from (Galley et al, 2003)?s LCseg
1JRip is implemented in the Weka (Witten et al, 1999) ma-
chine learning environment.

62% with the average distance between sentence and story
boundary of 1.97 and 2.91 words.
method, a TextTiling-like approach which weights
the cosine-similarity of a text window by an addi-
tional measure of its component LEXICAL CHAINS,
repetitions of stemmed content words. We also iden-
tify ?cue-words? from our training data that we find
to be significantly more likely (determined by ?2) to
occur at story boundaries within a window preceed-
ing or following a story boundary. We include as
features the number of such words observed within
3, 5, 7 and 10 word windows before and after the
candidate sentence boundary. For English, we in-
clude the number of pronouns contained in the sen-
tence, on the assumption that speakers would use
more pronouns at the end of stories than at the be-
ginning. We have not yet obtained reliable part-of-
speech tagging for Arabic or Mandarin. Finally, for
all three languages, we include features that repre-
sent the sentence length in words, and the relative
sentence position in the broadcast.
Acoustic/prosodic information has been shown to
be indicative of topic boundaries in both sponta-
neous dialogs and more structured speech, such as,
broadcast news (cf. (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998;
Shriberg et al, 2000; Levow, 2004)). The acous-
tic features we extract include, for the current sen-
tence, the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard
deviation of F0 and intensity, and the median and
mean absolute slope of F0 calculated over the en-
tire sentence. Additionally, we compute the first-
order difference from the previous sentence of each
of these. As a approximation of each sentence?s
speaking rate, we include the ratio of voiced 10ms
frames to the total number of frames in the sentence.
These acoustic values were extracted from the audio
input using Praat speech analysis software(Boersma,
2001). Also, using the phone alignment information
derived from the ASR process, we calculate speak-
ing rate in terms of the number of vowels per second
as an additional feature. Under the hypothesis that
topic-ending sentences may exhibit some additional
phrase-final lenghthening, we compare the length of
the sentence-final vowel and of the sentence-final
rhyme to average durations for that vowel and rhyme
for the speaker, where speaker identify is available
from the NIGHTINGALE diarization component;
otherwise we use unnormalized values.
We also use speaker identification information
from the diarization component to extract some fea-
126
tures indicative of a speaker?s participation in the
broadcast as a whole. We hypothesize that partici-
pants in a broadcast may have different roles, such
as an anchor providing transitions between stories
and reporters beginning new stories (Barzilay et al,
2000) and thus that speaker identity may serve as
a story boundary indicator. To capture such infor-
mation, we include binary features answering the
questions: ?Is the speaker preceeding this boundary
the first speaker in the show??, ?Is this the first time
the speaker has spoken in this broadcast??, ?The last
time??, and ?Does a speaker boundary occur at this
sentence boundary??. Also, we include the percent-
age of sentences in the broadcast spoken by the cur-
rent speaker.
We assumed in the development of this system
that the source of the broadcast is known, specif-
ically the source language and the show identity
(e. g. ABC ?World News Tonight?, CNN ?Head-
line News?). Given this information, we constructed
different classifiers for each show. This type of
source-specific modeling was shown to improve per-
formance by Tu?r (2001).
5 Results and Discussion
We report the results of our system on En-
glish, Mandarin and Arabic in Table 5. All results
use show-specific modeling, which consistently im-
proved our results across all metrics, reducing er-
rors by between 10% and 30%. In these tables, we
report the F-measure of identifying the precise lo-
cation of a story boundary as well as three metrics
designed specifically for this type of segmentation
task: the pk metric (Beeferman et al, 1999), Win-
dowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) and Cseg (Pseg= 0.3) (Doddington, 1998). All three are derived
from the pk metric (Beeferman et al, 1999), and for
all, lower values imply better performance. For each
of these three metrics we let k = 5, as prescribed in
(Beeferman et al, 1999).
In every system, the best peforming results are
achieved by including all features from the lexical,
acoustic and speaker-dependent feature sets. Across
all languages, our precision?and false alarm rates?
are better than recall?and miss rates. We believe
that inserting erroneous story boundaries will lead
to more serious downstream errors in anaphora res-
olution and summarization than a boundary omis-
sion will. Therefore, high precision is more impor-
tant than high recall for a helpful story segmentation
system. In the English and Mandarin systems, the
lexical and acoustic feature sets perform similarly,
and combine to yield improved results. However,
on the Arabic data, the acoustic feature set performs
quite poorly, suggesting that the use of vocal cues to
topic transitions may be fundamentally different in
Arabic. Moreover, these differences are not simply
differences of degree or direction. Rather, the acous-
tic indicators of topic shifts in English and Man-
darin are, simply, not discriminative when applied
to Arabic. This difference may be due to the style of
Arabic newscasts or to the language itself. Across
configurations, we find that the inclusion of features
derived from automatic speaker identification (fea-
ture set S), errorful as it is, significantly improves
performance. This improvement is particularly pro-
nounced on the Mandarin material; in China News
Radio broadcasts, story boundaries are very strongly
correlated with speaker transitions.
It is difficult to determine how well our system
performs against state-of-the-art story segmentation.
There are no comparable results for the TDT-4 cor-
pus. On the English TDT-2 corpus, (Shriberg et al,
2000) report a Cseg score of 0.1438. While our scoreof .0670 is half that, we hesitate to conclude that
our system is significantly better than this system;
since the (Shriberg et al, 2000) results are based on a
word-level segmentation, the discrepancy may be in-
fluenced by the disparate datasets as well as the per-
formance of the two systems. On CNN and Reuters
stories from the TDT-1 corpus, (Stokes, 2003) re-
port a Pk score of 0.25 and a WD score of 0.253.
Our Pk score is better than this on TDT-4, while
our WD score is worse. (Chaisorn et al, 2003) re-
port an F-measure of 0.532 using only audio-based
features on the TRECVID 2003 corpus , which is
higher than our system, however, this allows for
?correct? boundaries to fall within 5 seconds of ref-
erence boundaries. (Franz et al, 2000) present a sys-
tem which achieves Cseg scores of 0.067 and Man-darin BN and 0.081 on English audio in TDT-3. This
suggests that their system may be better than ours
on Mandarin, and worse on English, although we
trained and tested on different corpora. Finally, we
are unaware of any reported story segmentation re-
sults on Arabic BN.

6 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented results of our
story boundary detection procedures on English,
Mandarin, and Arabic Broadcast News from the
TDT-4 corpus. All features are obtained automati-
cally, except for the identity of the news show and
the source language, information which is, however,
available from the data itself, and could be automat-
ically obtained. Our performance on TDT-4 BN ap-
pears to be better than previous work on earlier cor-
pora of BN for English, and slightly worse than pre-
vious efforts on Mandarin, again for a different cor-
pus. We believe our Arabic results to be the first
reported evaluation for BN in that language. One
important observation from our study is that acous-
tic/prosodic features that correlate with story bound-
aries in English and in Mandarin, do not correlate
with Arabic boundaries. Our further research will
adress the study of vocal cues to segmentation in
Arabic BN.
