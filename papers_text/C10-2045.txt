Abstract
In the field of multi-document summa-
rization, the Pyramid method has be-
come an important approach for evaluat-
ing machine-generated summaries. The
method is based on the manual annotation
of text spans with the same meaning in a
set of human model summaries. In this
paper, we present an unsupervised, prob-
abilistic topic modeling approach for au-
tomatically identifying such semantically
similar text spans. Our approach reveals
some of the structure of model summaries
and identifies topics that are good approx-
imations of the Summary Content Units
(SCU) used in the Pyramid method. Our
results show that the topic model identi-
fies topic-sentence associations that corre-
spond to the contributors of SCUs, sug-
gesting that the topic modeling approach
can generate a viable set of candidate
SCUs for facilitating the creation of Pyra-
mids.
1 Introduction
In the field of multi-document summariza-
tion (MDS), the Pyramid method has become
an important approach for evaluating machine-
generated summaries (Nenkova and Passonneau,
2004; Passonneau et al, 2005; Nenkova et al,
2007). The method rewards automatic summaries
for conveying content that has the same meaning
as content represented in a set of human model
summaries. This approach allows for variation in
the way the content is expressed, which contrasts
the Pyramid method with other evaluation meth-
ods such as ROUGE that measure word n-gram
overlap (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
The Pyramid method groups content with
the same meaning into Summary Content Units
(SCU). Shared content needs to be identified man-
ually by human inspection of summaries, adding
yet another level of human effort (on top of
creating model summaries) to the task of sum-
mary evaluation. However, Nenkova and Passon-
neau (2004) as well as Harnly et al (2005) ob-
serve that semantically similar text spans writ-
ten by different human summarizers are often ex-
pressed with a similar choice of words, albeit with
differences e.g. in word variants, word order and
paraphrasing (Section 2).
In this paper, we present an approach for au-
tomatically identifying semantically similar text
spans in human model summaries on the basis
of such re-occurring word patterns. We utilize
a method known as probabilistic topic model-
ing (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007). Topic models
are claimed to derive semantic information from
text in an unsupervised fashion, using only the ob-
served word distributions (Section 3).
? We train a probabilistic topic model based
on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al,
2003) on the term-sentence matrix of human
model summaries used in the Document Un-
derstanding Conference (DUC) 2007 Pyra-
mid evaluation1. We analyze the resulting
model to evaluate whether a topic model cap-
tures useful structures of these summaries
(Section 4.1).

? Given the model, we compare the automati-
cally identified topics with SCUs on the ba-
sis of their word distributions (Sections 4.2
and 4.3). We discover a clear correspondence
between topics and SCUs, which suggests
that many automatically identified topics are
good approximations of manually annotated
SCUs.
? We analyze the distribution of topics over
summary sentences in Section 4.4, and com-
pare the topic-sentence associations com-
puted by our model with the SCU-sentence
associations given by the Pyramid annota-
tion. Our results suggest that the topic model
finds many SCU-like topics, and associates
a given topic with the same summary sen-
tences in which a human annotator identifies
the corresponding SCU.
Automatically identifying topics that approxi-
mate SCUs has clear practical applications: The
topics can be used as a candidate set of SCUs for
human annotators to speed up the process of SCU
creation. Topics can also be identified in machine-
generated summaries using standard statistical in-
ference techniques (Asuncion et al, 2009).
2 Summary Content Units
In this section, we briefly introduce the Pyramid
method and the properties of Summary Content
Units that we intend to exploit in our approach.
A Pyramid is a model predicting the distribu-
tion of information content in summaries, as re-
flected in the summaries humans write (Passon-
neau et al, 2005; Nenkova et al, 2007). Simi-
lar information content is identified by inspection
of similar sentences, and parts of these, in differ-
ent human model summaries. Typically, the text
spans which express the same semantic content
are not longer than a clause. An SCU consists of
a collection of text spans with the same meaning
(contributors) and a defining label specified by the
annotator.
Each SCU is weighted by the number of hu-
man model summaries it occurs in (i.e. the num-
ber of contributors). The Pyramid metric assumes
that an SCU with a high number of contributors is
more informative than an SCU with few contrib-
utors. An optimal summary, in terms of content
selection, is obtained by maximizing the sum of
SCU weights, given a maximum number of SCUs
that can be included for a predefined summary
length (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).
Two example SCUs are given in Table 1. SCU
18 has a weight of 3, since three model sum-
maries contribute to it, SCU 21 has a weight of 2.
SCU 18 aggregates contributors which share some
key phrases such as ?Air National Guard? and
?search?, but otherwise exhibit a quite heteroge-
neous word usage. Contributor 3 gives details on
the aircraft type, and specifies a time when the first
sea vessel was launched to search for the missing
plane. Only contributor 1 gives information about
the location of the search. In SCU 21, the first
contributor contains additional information about
communication with the Kennedy family, which is
not expressed in the SCU label and therefore not
part of the meaning of the SCU. Both contributors
contain key terms such as ?officials?, ?search? and
?recovery?, but vary in word order and verb usage.
Passonneau et al (2005) discuss this observation,
and argue that SCUs emerge from the judgment
of annotators, and are thus independent of what
words are used, or how many.
However, an analysis of typical SCUs shows
that contributors written by different human sum-
marizers are often expressed with a similar choice
of words or even phrases. Contributors vary in
using different forms of the same words (inflec-
tional or derivational variants), different word or-
der, syntactic structure, and paraphrases (Harnly
et al, 2005; Nenkova et al, 2007).
3 Probabilistic Topic Models
Our approach for discovering semantically similar
text spans makes use of a statistical method known
as topic modeling. Probabilistic topic models can
derive semantic information from text automat-
ically, on the basis of the observed word pat-
terns (Hofmann, 1999; Blei et al, 2003; Steyvers
and Griffiths, 2007). The main assumption of
these models is that a latent set of variables ? the
topics ? can be utilized to explain the observed
patterns in the data. Documents are represented as
mixtures of topics, and each topic is a distribution

over words. For example, a news article describ-
ing a meeting of the International Monetary Fund
may in equal parts discuss economic and politi-
cal issues. Topic models discover in a completely
unsupervised fashion meaningful topics as well as
intra- and inter-document statistical structure us-
ing no information except the distribution of the
words themselves (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
For our analysis, we use the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) model introduced by Blei et
al. (2003). In this model, each document is gen-
erated by first choosing a distribution over topics
?(d), parametrized by a conjugate Dirichlet prior
?. Subsequently, each word of this document is
generated by drawing a topic zk from ?(d), and
then drawing a word wi from topic zk?s distri-
bution over words ?(k). We follow Griffiths et
al. (2004) and place a conjugate Dirichlet prior ?
over ?(k) as well. Figure 1 shows the graphical
model representation of LDA.
For T topics, the matrix ? specifies the proba-
bility p(w|z) of words given topics, and ? spec-
ifies the probability p(z|d) of topics given docu-
ments. p(w|z) indicates which words are impor-
tant in a topic, and p(z|d) tells us which topics are
dominant in a document. We employ Gibbs sam-
pling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) to estimate
the posterior distribution over z (the assignment of
word tokens to topics), given the observed words
w of the document set. From this estimate we can
approximate the distributions for the matrices ?
and ?.
4 Experiments
Can a topic model reveal some of the structure
of human model summaries and learn topics that
are approximations of manually annotated SCUs?
To answer these questions, we train a topic model
on the human model summaries of each of the 23
document clusters of the DUC 2007 dataset that
were used in Pyramid evaluation2. There are 4
human model summaries available for each docu-
ment cluster. On average, the summary sets con-
tain 52.4 sentences, with a vocabulary of 260.5
terms, which occur a total of 549.7 times. The
Pyramids of these summary sets consist of 68.8
SCUs on average. The number of SCUs per SCU

weight follows a Zipfian distribution, i.e. there are
typically very few SCUs of weight 4, and very
many SCUs of weight 1 (see also Passonneau et
al. (2005)).
4.1 Topic model training
Since we are interested in modeling topics for sen-
tences, we treat each sentence as a document3.
We construct a matrix A of term-sentence co-
occurrence observations for each set of human
model summaries S. Each entry Aij corresponds
to the frequency of word i in sentence j, and j
ranges over the union of the sentences contained
in S. We preprocess terms using stemming and
removing a standard list of stop words with the
NLTK toolkit4.
We run the Gibbs sampling algorithm on A,
setting the parameter T , the number of latent top-
ics to learn, equal to the number of SCUs con-
tained in the Pyramid of S. We use this particular
value for T since we want to learn a topic model
with a structure that reflects the SCUs and the dis-
tribution of SCUs of the corresponding Pyramid.
For an unannotated set of summaries, determining
an optimal value for T is a Bayesian model selec-
tion problem (Kass and Raftery, 1995).
The topic distribution for each sentence should
be peaked toward a single or only very few top-
ics. To ensure that the topic-specific word dis-
tributions p(w|z) as well as the sentence-specific
topic distributions p(z|d) behave as intended, we
set the Dirichlet priors ? = 0.01 and ? = 0.01.
This enforces a bias toward sparsity, resulting in
distributions that are more peaked (Steyvers and
Griffiths, 2007). A low value of ? also favors
more fine-grained topics (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004). We run the Gibbs sampler for 2000 itera-
tions, and collect a single sample from the result-
ing posterior distribution over topic assignments
for words. From this sample we compute the con-
ditional distributions p(w|z) and p(z|d).
During our experiments, we observed that the
Gibbs Sampler did not always use all the topics
available. Instead, some topics had a uniform
distribution over words, i.e. no words were as-

changeably from here on.

signed to these topics during the sampling pro-
cess. We assume this is due to the relatively low
prior ? = 0.01 we use in our experiments. We ex-
plore the consequences of varying the LDA priors
and T in Section 4.4.
This observation indicates that the topic model
cannot learn as many distinct topics from a given
set of summaries as there are SCUs in the Pyra-
mid of these summaries. On average, 24.4% (? =
17.4) of the sampled topics had a uniform word
distribution, but the fraction of such topics varied.
For some summary sets, it was very low (D0701,
D0706 with 0%), whereas for others it was very
high (D0704, D0728 with 52%). Both of the lat-
ter summary sets contain many SCUs with very
similar labels and often only a single contributor,
e.g. about ?Amnesty International?:
? AI criticism frequently involves genocide
? AI criticism frequently involves intimidation
? AI criticism frequently involves police vio-
lence
These SCUs are derived from summary sen-
tences that contain enumerations: ?AI criticism
frequently involves political prisoners, torture, in-
timidation, police violence, the death penalty,
no alternative service for conscientious objectors,
and interference with the judiciary.? A topic
model is based on word-document co-occurrence
data, and cannot distinguish between the different
grammatical objects in this case. Instead, it treats
these phrases as semantically similar since they
occur in the same sentence.
4.2 SCU word distributions and SCU-
sentence associations
In order to evaluate the quality of the LDA top-
ics, we compare their word distributions to the
word distributions of SCUs. This allows us to an-
alyze if the LDA topics capture similar word pat-
terns as SCUs. We approximate the distribution
over words p(w|sl) for each SCU sl as the rel-
ative frequency of word wi in the bag-of-words
constructed from the texts of sl?s label and con-
tributors. We denote the resulting matrix of for a
set of SCUs as ??.

Table 2: Top terms of best matching LDA topics and SCUs for summary set D0742
In addition, we can compare the topic-sentence
associations computed by the model to the SCU-
sentence associations given by the Pyramid anno-
tation. If the probability of a given topic is high
in those sentences which contribute to a particular
SCU, this would suggest that the topic model can
automatically learn topics which not only have a
word distribution similar to a specific SCU, but
also a similar distribution over contributing sen-
tences.
SCU contributors are typically annotated as a
set of contiguous sequences of words within a sin-
gle sentence. In the DUC 2007 data, there are only
a few cases where a contributor spans more than
one sentence. The DUCView annotation tool5
stores the start and end character position of the
phrases marked as contributors of an SCU. We can
utilize this information to define which sentences
an SCU is associated with. We store the associa-
tions in a matrix ??, where ??ij = 1 if SCU i is
associated with sentence j. Sentences may con-
tain multiple SCUs, and SCUs are associated with
5http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/?becky/DUC2006/2006-

as many sentences as their number of contributors.
4.3 Matching SCUs and LDA topics
Before we can compare the topic-sentence asso-
ciations computed by the LDA topic model with
the SCU-sentence associations, we need to match
SCUs to LDA topics. We consider a topic to be
similar to an SCU if their word distributions are
similar. We discard all LDA topics with a uni-
form word distribution (see Section 4.1) before
the matching step.
We then compute the pair-wise Jensen-Shannon
(JS) divergence between columns j of ? and k of
??:
JS(?j , ??k) =
[1
2DKL(?j ||M)
+12DKL(??k||M)
]
, (1)
where M = 1/2(?j + ??k). SCUs from ?? are
matched to topics of ? on the basis of this dis-
similarity using a simple greedy approach, i.e. by
iteratively selecting the current most similar SCU-

topic pair. We reorder the rows of ? according to
the computed matching.
Figure 2 shows some example SCU-topic
matches for three different DUC 2007 summary
sets. Each cell displays the JS divergence of the
word distributions of an LDA topic (rows) com-
pared to an SCU (columns). On the diagonal, the
best matches of LDA topics and SCUs are ordered
by increasing JS divergence. Multiple points with
low JS divergence in a single column indicate that
more than one LDA topic was very similar to this
SCU. Overall, the graphs show a clear correspon-
dence of LDA topics to the SCUs. The plots sug-
gest that a large percentage of topics have simi-
lar distributions over words as the corresponding
SCUs. Table 2 shows the most likely terms for
some example topic-SCU matches. For each of
these matches, the top terms are almost identical.
4.4 Evaluation
To compare the topic distributions ? with the
SCU-sentence assignments ??, we binarize ? to
give ?? by setting all entries ??ij = 1 if ?ij > ,
and 0 otherwise. We set  = 0.1 in our experi-
ments6. ??ij is therefore equal to 1 if a topic i has
a high probability sentence j. We can now eval-
uate if a given topic occurs in the same sentences
as the corresponding SCU (recall), and if it occurs
in no other sentences (precision).
We compute precision and recall for each topic-
SCU match with JS(?j , ??k) ? ?. Averaged
over matches, these measures give us an indica-
tion of how well the LDA model approximates
the set of SCUs. The parameter ? allows us to
tune the performance of the model with respect
to the quality and number of topic-SCU matches.
Setting ? to a low value will consider only topic-
SCU matches with a low JS divergence, which
generally results in higher precision and recall. In-
creasing ? will include more topic-SCU matches,
namely those with a larger JS divergence, which
will therefore introduce some noise.
Figure 3(a) shows the precision and recall
6Since the LDA algorithm learns very peaked distribu-
tions, the actual value of this threshold does not have a large
impact on the resulting binary matrix and subsequent eval-
uation results. We evaluated a range of settings for  in
[0.001 ? 0.5], all with similar performance. This observa-
tion is confirmed by the threshold-less Mean Average Preci-
sion results in Figure 3(b).
396
curves for different values of the parameter ?, av-
eraged over all summary sets. The plots show
that both the precision and recall of the discov-
ered topic-sentence associations are quite high,
suggesting that the model automatically identifies
topics which are very similar to manually anno-
tated SCUs. With increasing ?, precision and re-
call scores decrease: The word distributions of
the topic-SCU pairs are increasingly dissimilar,
and hence the sentences associated with a topic
do not necessarily overlap anymore with the sen-
tences of the paired SCU. The figure also shows
the fraction of topic matches that are considered
in the evaluation of precision and recall. There
is a clear trade off between performance and the
number of matches retrieved. However, many of
the topic-SCU matches (? 50%) have a JS diver-
gence ? 0.4, suggesting that the word distribu-
tions of many LDA topics are very similar to SCU
word distributions.
Since we observed that the Gibbs sampling
does not always utilize the full set of topics, we
repeat our experiments to evaluate how the per-
formance of the model changes when varying the
LDA priors and T . Figure 3(b) shows F1 and
Mean Average Precision (MAP)7 results of the
topic model for different values of the parameter
?, where T = ? ? |SCU |. For example, a value of
0.6 means that for each summary set, T was set to
60% of the number of SCUs in the corresponding
Pyramid. We see that the MAP score increases
quickly, and reaches a plateau for ? ? 0.3. The
F1 score increases more slowly, and levels out for
? ? 0.6. The model?s performance is relatively
robust with respect to ?. This observation can be
helpful when training models for new summary
sets without an existing Pyramid, and which there-
fore consider T as a parameter to be optimized.
When varying the LDA priors, we observe that
for 0.01 ? ? ? 0.05, F1 and MAP scores are
consistently high, whereas for other settings, per-
formance decreases significantly. Similarly, ? ?
0.05 results in lower F1 and MAP scores. The
7MAP is a rank-based measure, which avoids the need
for introducing a threshold to binarize ? (Baeza-Yates and
Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). For each topic, we create a ranked list
of sentences according to the transposed matrix ?T . This
gives high ranks to sentences for which a particular topic has
a high probability.
fraction of uniform topics decreases with higher
?, e.g. for ? = 0.1 it is close to zero. In con-
trast, higher settings of ? increase the fraction of
uniform topics.8
Finally, Figure 4 shows separate precision and
recall curves for SCUs of different weights, and
for different settings of parameter ?. Results are
again averaged over all summary sets. In 4(a),
we see that the recall of topic-sentence associa-
tions is very similar for all SCUs, with SCUs of
higher weight exhibiting a slightly better recall.
However, as Figure 4(b) shows, the average pre-
cision of SCUs with lower weight is much higher.
Intuitively, this is expectable as SCUs of higher
weight tend to have a larger vocabulary due to the
higher number of contributors. This results in a
larger word overlap with non-relevant sentences.
The fraction of topic-SCU matches retrieved for
SCUs of different weight is similar for all types of
SCUs (not shown here).
5 Related Work
The Pyramid approach was introduced by
Nenkova and Passonneau (2004) as a method for
evaluating machine-generated summaries based
on a set of human model summaries. The authors
address a number of shortcomings of manual and
automatic summary evaluation methods such as
ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003), and argue that the
Pyramid method is reliable, diagnostic and predic-
tive.
Passonneau and et al (2005) give an account of
the results of applying the Pyramid method during
the DUC 2005 summarization evaluation, and dis-
cuss the annotation process. In subsequent work,
Nenkova et al (2007) describe in more detail the
incorporation of human variation in the Pyramid
method, the reliability of content annotation, and
the correlation of Pyramid scores with other eval-
uation measures.
Harnly et al (2005) present an approach for au-
tomatically scoring a machine summary given an
existing Pyramid. Their method searches for an
optimal set of candidate contributors created auto-
matically from the machine summary and matches
candidates to SCUs using a clustering approach.

The method assumes the existence of a Pyramid,
whereas our approach aims to discover candidate
SCUs from a set of human model summaries in an
unsupervised fashion.
Recently, Louis and Nenkova (2009) presented
an approach for fully automatic, model-free eval-
uation of machine-generated summaries. The
method assumes that the distribution of words in
the input and an informative summary should be
similar. We think that it could be an interesting
idea to combine the proposed method with our
approach, in an attempt to exploit both the model-
free evaluation and the shallow semantics of latent
topics.
Probabilistic topic models have been success-
fully applied to a variety of tasks (Hofmann, 1999;
Blei et al, 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004;
Hall et al, 2008). In text summarization, most
topic modeling approaches utilize a term-sentence
co-occurrence matrix to discover topics in the set
of input documents. Each sentence is typically as-
signed to a single topic, and a topic is a cluster of
multiple sentences (Wang et al, 2009; Tang et al,
2009; Hennig, 2009).
6 Conclusions and future work
We presented a probabilistic topic modeling ap-
proach that reveals some of the structure of human
model summaries. The topic model is trained on
the term-sentence matrix of a set of human sum-
maries, and discovers semantic topics in a com-
pletely unsupervised fashion. Many of the topics
identified by our model for a given set of sum-
maries show a similar distribution over words as
the manually annotated Summary Content Units
of the summaries? Pyramid.
We utilized the word distributions of SCUs
and topics to match topics to similar SCUs, and
showed that the topics identified by the model of-
ten occur in the same sentences as the contribu-
tors of the corresponding SCU. Precision and re-
call of these topic-sentence assignments are very
high when compared to the SCU-sentence associ-
ations, indicating that many of the automatically
acquired topics are good approximations of SCUs.
Our results suggest that a topic model can be used
to learn a candidate set of SCUs to facilitate the
process of Pyramid creation.
We note that the topic model that we ap-
plied is one of the simplest latent variable mod-
els. A more complex model could integrate syn-
tax to relax the bag-of-words assumption (Wal-
lach, 2006), or combine the statistical model with
more linguistically-grounded methods to handle
linguistic features such as enumerations or nega-
tion.
