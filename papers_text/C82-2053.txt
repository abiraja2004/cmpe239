A FOR~ PROCEDURE FOR BULGARIAN WORD FORM GENERATION 
Elena Paskaleva 
Sofia, Bulgaria 
The generation procedure proposed aims at the modell ing 
of the process of verbal and nominal inflexion in Bulgarian. 
As in most of the similar morphological models of inflexional 
languages the procedure uses a comparatively simple mechar~ism 
of description - a comparatively small number of initial 
objects among which onl.y one relation (viz. concatenation) is 
assigned; the transitions generating a separate concrete word 
form (or class of word forms) are determined. 
The procedure includes the following l inguistic objects-" 
S = (s I, s2,..., s n )- a set of stems in Bulgarian 
(these can be the stems of dictionary entries in .a sufficient- 
ly full dictionary of Bulgarian or the stems of lexical items 
used by the native speaker in his language behaviour). 
K = (kl, k2, .., k~ - where k i i s a number of an in- 
flexional type. 
G = (g1' g2''''' gp) " where gi is grammatical meaning. 
P = < f1' f2" ' ' '  fg) " where fi is an ending. 
T = < tl, t2,... , tr) - where t i is the so called "theme", 
i.e. one of the following elements: a thematic vowel in the 
verbal conjugation, a form-building suffix in the nominal de- 
clension or an extension of the stem in putting an article to 
some masculine adjectives. 
A = < al, a2,... , a s) - where a i is a postpositional 
article. 
- 217  - 
b 
D : (d I, ~ ,  ..., dw} - where d i is an inflexlonal 
suffix. (This deviation from the aim of the model to describe 
only the processes of inflexlon is conditioned by the dual 
nature of the participle as a part of the verbal paradigm 
and at the same time following the adjectival declension. 
This is the reason why, as we shall see below, it is generat- 
ed in two phases: "verbal stem-~ stem of a particlple" and 
"stem of a participle ~ word form of a participle". In the 
first phase elements participate belonging %o the verbal in- 
flexion (the thematic vowel typical for the inflexional type 
of the verbal stem), and in the second, elements belonging 
to the adjectival declension. 
The elements of S csm be mapped onto K. This map is 
many-one. The element correspondlng to s is denoted by k s- 
Between the elements of G and F, G and T, G and D, G 
and A correspondences exist which must be assigned in a 
table because of special language reasons - the ambiguity of 
the morphological elements and the different inflexion of one 
grammatical category. 
For an initial symbol (S) of the generation procedure, 
some s i is accepted accompanied by the corresponding ksl and 
the set G s c G. By the concatenation of s with t, d, a and 
f (the sequence of operations can be followed on the transit- 
ion network) the followin 6 linguistic objects are obtained: 
a. as intermediate states of the generation procedure: 
ST - extended stem, i.e. "stem + theme" (s i t~)~ 
SD - derlvatlonal stem, i.e. "stem (+eventually a 
theme) + word forming suffix" (s i t~ d m or 
s I ~).

SP - word form!  /-~ 
S~ - word fo rm wi th  a postpos i t iona l  a r t i c le  (SF ar ) .
