Abstract
We introduce a word alignment framework
that facilitates the incorporation of syntax en-
coded in bilingual dependency tree pairs. Our
model consists of two sub-models: an anchor
word alignment model which aims to find a set
of high-precision anchor links and a syntax-
enhanced word alignment model which fo-
cuses on aligning the remaining words relying
on dependency information invoked by the ac-
quired anchor links. We show that our syntax-
enhanced word alignment approach leads to a
10.32% and 5.57% relative decrease in align-
ment error rate compared to a generative word
alignment model and a syntax-proof discrim-
inative word alignment model respectively.
Furthermore, our approach is evaluated ex-
trinsically using a phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation system. The results show
that SMT systems based on our word align-
ment approach tend to generate shorter out-
puts. Without length penalty, using our word
alignments yields statistically significant im-
provement in Chinese?English machine trans-
lation in comparison with the baseline word
alignment.
1 Introduction
Automatic word alignment can be defined as the
problem of determining translational correspon-
dences at word level given a parallel corpus of
aligned sentences. Bilingual word alignment is a
fundamental component of most approaches to sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT). Dominant ap-
proaches to word alignment can be classified into
two main schools: generative and discriminative
word alignment models.
Generative word alignment models, initially de-
veloped at IBM (Brown et al, 1993), and then
augmented by an HMM-based model (Vogel et al,
1996), have provided powerful modeling capability
for word alignment. However, it is very difficult to
incorporate new features into these models. Dis-
criminative word alignment models, based on dis-
criminative training of a set of features (Liu et al,
2005; Moore, 2005), on the other hand, are more
flexible to incorporate new features, and feature se-
lection is essential to the performance of the system.
Syntactic annotation of bilingual corpora, which
can be obtained more efficiently and accurately with
the advances in monolingual language processing,
is a potential information source for word align-
ment tasks. For example, Part-of-Speech (POS) tags
of source and target words can be used to tackle
the data sparseness problem in discriminative word
alignment (Liu et al, 2005; Blunsom and Cohn,
2006). Shallow parsing has also been used to pro-
vide relevant information for alignment (Ren et al,
2007; Sun et al, 2000). Deeper syntax, e.g. phrase
or dependency structures, has been shown useful in
generative models (Wang and Zhou, 2004; Lopez
and Resnik, 2005), heuristic-based models (Ayan et
al., 2004; Ozdowska, 2004) and even for syntac-
tically motivated models such as ITG (Wu, 1997;
Cherry and Lin, 2006).
In this paper, we introduce an approach to im-
prove word alignment by incorporating syntactic de-
pendencies. Our approach is motivated by the fact
that words tend to be dependent on each other. If
69
we can first obtain a set of reliable anchor links, we
could take advantage of the syntactic dependencies
relating unaligned words to aligned anchor words to
expand the alignment. Figure 1 gives an illustrating
example. Note that the link (2, 4) can be easily iden-
tified, but the link involving the fourth Chinese word
(a function word denoting ?time?) (4, 4) is hard. In
such cases, we can make use of the dependency re-
lationship (?tclause?) between c2 and c4 to help the
alignment process. Given such an observation, our
model is composed of two related alignment models.
The first one is an anchor alignment model which is
used to find a set of anchor links; the other one is a
syntax-enhanced alignment model aiming to process
the words left unaligned after anchoring.
Figure 1: How syntactic dependencies can help word
alignment: an example
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we introduce our syntax-
enhanced discriminative word alignment approach.
The feature functions used are described in Sec-
tion 3. Experimental setting and results are pre-
sented in Section 4 and 5 respectively. In Section 6,
we compare our approach with other related word
alignment approaches. Section 7 concludes the pa-
per and gives avenues for future work.
2 Word Alignment Model
2.1 Notation
While in this paper we focus on Chinese?English,
the method proposed is applicable to any language
pair. The notation will assume Chinese?English
word alignment and Chinese?English MT. Here we
adopt a notation similar to (Brown et al, 1993).
Given a Chinese sentence cJ1 consisting of J words
{c1, ..., cJ} and an English sentence eI1 consisting of
I words e1, ..., eI , we define the alignment A be-
tween cJ1 and eI1 as a subset of the Cartesian product
of the word positions:
A ? {(j, i) : j = 1, ..., J ; i = 1, ..., I}
Our alignment representation is restricted so that
each source word can only be aligned to one tar-
get word. The alignment A consists of associations
j ? i = aj from a source position j to a target po-
sition i = aj . The ?null? alignment aj = 0 with the
?empty? word e0 is used to account for source words
that are not aligned to any target word.
We use A? to denote a subset of A. The indices of
the K source words involved in A? are represented
as ?K1 and the corresponding target indices for ?k
are represented as a?k . The unaligned source words
are represented as ??.
2.2 General Model
Given a source sentence cJ1 and target sentence eI1,
we seek to find the optimum alignment A? such that:
A? = argmax
A
P (A|cJ1 , eI1) (1)
We use a model (2) that directly models the link-
age between source and target words similarly to (It-
tycheriah and Roukos, 2005). We decompose this
model into an anchor alignment model (3) and a
syntax-enhanced model (4) by distinguishing the an-
chor alignment from the non-anchor alignment.
p(A|cJ1 , eI1) =
J
?
j=0
p(aj |cJ1 , eI1, aj?11 ) (2)
= 1Z ? p?(A?|c
J
1 , eI1) ? (3)
?
j???
p(aj|cJ1 , eI1, aj?11 , A?) (4)
2.3 Anchor Alignment Model
The anchor alignment model p?(A?) aims to find a
set of high precision links. Various approaches can
be used for this purpose. In this paper we adopted
the following two approaches.
2.3.1 Heuristics-based Approach
The problem of word alignment is regarded as a
process of word linkage disambiguation, i.e. choos-
ing the correct links between words from all com-
peting hypothesis (Melamed, 2000; Deng and Gao,
2007).
70
We constrain the link probabilities in such a way
that:
?i? ? {1, ..., I}, i? 6= i : p((j, i))p((j, i?)) > ?1 (5)
?j? ? {1, ..., J}, j? 6= j : p((j, i))p((j?, i)) > ?2 (6)
Condition (5) implies that for the source word cj ,
the link with the target word ei is more probable
(with reliability threshold ?1) than the link with any
other target word. Condition (6) guarantees that for
the target word ei, cj is the only most probable (with
threshold ?2) source word to be linked to.
2.3.2 Intersected Generative Word Alignment
Models
We can use the asymmetric IBM models for bidi-
rectional word alignment and get the intersection.
2.4 Syntax-Enhanced Word Alignment Model
The syntax-enhanced model is used to model the
alignment of the words left unaligned after anchor-
ing. We directly model the linkage between source
and target words using a discriminative word align-
ment framework where various features can be in-
corporated. Given a source word cj and the target
sentence eI1, we search for the alignment aj such
that:
a?j = argmax
aj
{p?M1 (aj |c
J
1 , eI1, a
j?1
1 , A?)} (7)
= argmax
aj
{?Mm=1 ?mhm(cJ1 , eI1, a
j
1, A?, Tc, Te)}
In this decision rule, we assume that a set of highly
reliable anchor alignments A? has been obtained,
and Tc (resp. Te) is used to denote the dependency
structure for source (resp. target) language. In such
a framework, various machine learning techniques
can be used for parameter estimation.
3 Feature Function for Syntax-Enhanced
Model
The various features used in our syntax-enhanced
model can be classified into three groups: statistics-
based features, syntactic features and relative distor-
tion features.
3.1 Statistics-based Features
3.1.1 IBM model 1 score
IBM model 1 is a position-independent word
alignment model which is often used to boot-
strap parameters for more complex models. Model
1 models the conditional distribution and uses a
uniform distribution for the dependencies between
source word positions and target word positions.
Pr(cJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) =
p(J |I)
(I + 1)J
J
?
j=1
p(cj |eaj ) (8)
3.1.2 Log-likelihood ratio
The log-likelihood ratio statistic has been found to
be accurate for modeling the associations between
rare events (Dunning, 1993). It has also been suc-
cessfully used to measure the associations between
word pairs (Melamed, 2000; Moore, 2005). Given
the following contingency table:
cj ?cj
ei a b
?ei c d
the log-likelihood ratio can be defined as:
G2(cj , ei) = ?2log
B(a|a + b, p1)B(c|c + d, p2)
B(a|a+ b, p)B(c|c + d, p)
where B(k|n, p) = (nk )pk(1 ? p)n?k are binomial
probabilities. The probability parameters can be ob-
tained using maximum likelihood estimates:
p1 =
a
a+ b , p2 =
c
c+ d (9)
p = a+ ca + b+ c+ d (10)
3.1.3 POS translation probability
The POS tags can provide effective information
for addressing the data sparseness problem using the
lexical features (Liu et al, 2005; Blunsom and Cohn,
2006). The POS translation probability can be easily
obtained using maximum likelihood estimation from
an annotated corpus:
Pr(Tc|Te) =
COL(Tc, Te)
COF (Te)
(11)
71
where Tc is a Chinese word?s POS tag and Te is an
English word?s POS tag. COL(Tc, Te) is the count
of Tc and Te being linked to each other in the corpus,
and COF (Te) is the frequency of Te in the corpus.
3.2 Syntactic Features
The dependency relation Re (resp. Rc) between two
English (resp. Chinese) words ei and ei? (resp. cj
and cj?) in the dependency tree of the English sen-
tence eI1 (resp. Chinese sentence cJ1 ) can be repre-
sented as a triple <ei, Re, ei?>(resp. <cj , Rc, ej?>).
Given cJ1 , eI1 and their syntactic dependency trees
TcJ1 , TeI1 , if ei is aligned to cj and ei? aligned to
cj? , according to the dependency correspondence as-
sumption (Hwa et al, 2002), there exists a triple
<cj , Rc, cj?>.
While we are not aiming to justify the feasibil-
ity of the dependency correspondence assumption
by proving to what extent Re = Rc under the con-
dition described above, we do believe that cj and cj?
are likely to be dependent on each other. Given the
anchor alignment A?, a candidate link (j, i) and the
dependency trees, we can design four classes of fea-
ture functions.
3.2.1 Agreement features
The agreement features can be further classi-
fied into dependency agreement features and depen-
dency label agreement features. Given a candidate
link (j, i) and the anchor alignment A?, the depen-
dency agreement (DA) feature function is defined as
follows:
hDA?1 =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if ? <cj, Rc, cj?>, <ei, Re, ei?>
and (j?, i?) ? A?,
0 otherwise.
(12)
By changing the dependency direction between the
words cj and cj? , we can derive another dependency
agreement feature:
hDA?2 =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if ? <cj? , Rc, cj>, <ei? , Re, ei>
and (j?, i?) ? A?,
0 otherwise.
(13)
We can define the dependency label agreement fea-
ture1 as follows:
hDLA?1 =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if ? <cj , Rc, cj?>, <ei, Re, ei?>
and (j?, i?) ? A?,Rc = Re,
0 otherwise.
(14)
Similarly we can obtain hDLA?2 by changing the
dependency direction.
3.2.2 Source word dependency features
Given a candidate link (j, i) and anchor alignment
A?, source language dependency features are used
to capture the dependency label between a source
word cj and a source anchor word ck ? ?. For
example, a feature function relating to dependency
type ?PRD? can be defined as:
hsrc?1?PRD =
?
?
?
?
?
1 if ? <cj, Rc, cj?>
and Rc =?PRD?,
0 otherwise.
(15)
By changing the direction we can obtain
hsrc?2?PRD.
3.2.3 Target word dependency features
Target word dependency features can be defined
in a similar way as source word dependency fea-
tures.
3.2.4 Target anchor feature
The target anchor feature defines whether the tar-
get word ei is an anchor word.
hsrc?1?PRD =
{
1 if i ? a?,
0 otherwise.
(16)
3.3 Relative distortion feature
We can design features encoding the relative dis-
tortion information which can be used to evaluate
a candidate link by computing its relative position
change with respect to the anchor alignment. The
relative position change of a candidate link l = (j, i)
is formally defined as follows:
1Note that we used the same dependency parser for source
and target language parsing.
72
D(l) = min(|dL|, |dR|) (17)
dL = (j ? jL) ? (i? iL) (18)
dR = (j ? jR)? (i? iR) (19)
where (iL, jL) is the leftmost anchor link of l,
(iR, jR) is the rightmost anchor link of l. The less
the relative position changes, the more likely the
candidate link is. With a set of anchor alignments,
we can obtain the distribution of the relative posi-
tion changes from an annotated corpus using maxi-
mum likelihood estimation. In our experiments, we
used the following four probabilities: p(D = 0),
p(D = 1, 2), p(D = 3, 4) and p(D > 4).
4 Experimental Setting
4.1 Data
The experiments were carried out using the
Chinese?English datasets provided within the
IWSLT 2007 evaluation campaign (Fordyce, 2007),
extracted from the Basic Travel Expression Corpus
(BTEC) (Takezawa et al, 2002). This multilingual
speech corpus contains sentences similar to those
that are usually found in phrase-books for tourists
going abroad.
We tagged all the sentences in the training and de-
vset3 using a maximum entropy-based POS tagger?
MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), trained on the Penn
English and Chinese Treebanks. Both Chinese and
English sentences are parsed using the Malt depen-
dency parser (Nivre et al, 2007), which achieved
84% and 88% labelled attachment scores for Chi-
nese and English respectively.
4.1.1 Word Alignment
We manually annotated word alignments on de-
vset3. Since manual word alignment is an ambigu-
ous task, we also explicitly allow for ambiguous
alignments, i.e. the links are marked as sure (S) or
possible (P) (Och and Ney, 2003). IWSLT devset3
consists of 502 sentence pairs after cleaning. We
used the first 300 sentence pairs for training, the fol-
lowing 50 sentence pairs as validation set and the
last 152 sentence pairs for testing.
4.1.2 Machine Translation
Training was performed using the default training
set (39,952 sentence pairs), to which we added the
set devset1 (506 sentence pairs).2 We used devset2
(506 sentence pairs, 16 references) to tune various
parameters in the MT system and IWSLT 2007 test
set (489 sentence pairs, 6 references) for testing.
4.2 Alignment Training and Search
In our experiments, we treated anchor alignment and
syntax-enhanced alignment as separate processes in
a pipeline. The anchor alignments are kept fixed so
that the parameters in the syntax-enhanced model
can be optimized.3 We used the support vector ma-
chine (SVM) toolkit?SVM light4 to optimize the
parameters in (7). Our model is constrained in such
a way that each source word can only be aligned to
one target word. Therefore, in training, we trans-
form each possible link involving the words left un-
aligned after anchoring into an event. In testing, the
source words are consumed in sequence and the tar-
get words serve as states. The SVM dual variable
was used to measure the reliability of each candidate
link and the alignment link for each word is made
independently, which makes the alignment search
much easier. A threshold t was set as the minimal
reliability score for each link. t is optimized accord-
ing to alignment error rate (21) on the validation set.
4.3 Baselines
4.3.1 Word Alignment
We used the GIZA++ implementation of IBM
word alignment model 4 (Brown et al, 1993; Och
and Ney, 2003) for word alignment, and the heuris-
tics described in (Och and Ney, 2003) to derive the
intersection and refined alignment.
4.3.2 Machine Translation
We use a standard log-linear phrase-based SMT
(PB-SMT) model as a baseline: GIZA++ implemen-
tation of IBM word alignment model 4,5 the refine-
2More specifically, we chose the first English reference from
the 16 references and the Chinese sentence to construct new
sentence pairs.
3Note our anchor alignment does not achieve 100% preci-
sion. Since we performed precision-oriented alignment for the
anchor alignment model, the errors in anchor alignment will not
bring much noise into the syntax-enhanced model.

5More specifically, we performed 5 iterations of Model 1, 5
iterations of HMM, 3 iterations of Model 3, and 3 iterations of
Model 4.

ment and phrase-extraction heuristics described in
(Koehn et al, 2003), minimum-error-rate training
(Och, 2003), a trigram language model with Kneser-
Ney smoothing trained with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)
on the English side of the training data, and Moses
(Koehn et al, 2007) to decode.
4.4 Evaluation
We evaluate the intrinsic quality of predicted align-
ment A with precision, recall and alignment error
rate (AER). Slightly differently from (Och and Ney,
2003), we use possible alignments in computing re-
call.
recall = |A ? P ||P | , precision =
|A ? P |
|A| (20)
AER(S,P ;A) = 1? |A ? S|+ |A ? P ||A| + |S| (21)
We also extrinsically measure the word alignment
quality via a Chinese?English translation task. The
translation output is measured using BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002).
5 Experimental Results
5.1 Word Alignment
We performed word alignment bidirectionally using
our approach to obtain the union and compared our
results with two strong baselines based on generative
word alignment models. The results are shown in
Table 1. We can see that both the syntax-enhanced
model based on HMM intersection anchors (Syntax-
HMM) and on IBM model 4 anchors (Syntax-Model
4) are better than the pure generative word alignment
models. Our approach is superior in precision with
a disadvantage in recall. The best result achieved
10.32% relative decrease in AER compared to the
baseline when we use IBM model 4 intersection to
obtain the set of anchor alignments.

5.1.1 The Influence of Anchor Alignment
Quality
As we can see in Table 2, our precision-oriented
approach to acquire anchor alignments was accom-
plished quite well. All four different anchor align-
ment models achieved high precision. However, the
recall differs dramatically, with model 4 achieving
the highest recall and the heuristics-based approach
receiving the lowest. To investigate the influence

of the anchor alignment model, we first obtained
the intersection of the words left unaligned after an-
choring using each of the anchor alignment models.
We evaluate the alignment of these words against
the gold-standard alignments involving these words.
The influence of anchor alignment on the perfor-
mance of the syntax-enhanced model can be seen
in Table 3. The performance of the syntax-enhanced
model is closely related to that of the anchor align-
ment method. As can be seen from Table 2 and
3, HMM anchoring achieves the best precision and
so does the syntax-enhanced alignment; IBM model
4 achieves the best recall and so does the syntax-
enhanced alignment. Finally, the best alignment per-
formances are obtained with IBM model 4 anchor-
ing, with the difference in recall between HMM and
IBM model 4 anchoring being more significant than
the difference in precision.

5.1.2 The Influence of Syntactic Dependencies
on Word Alignment
The influence of incorporating syntactic depen-
dencies into the word alignment process is shown
74
in Table 4. Syntax plays a positive role in all differ-
ent anchor alignment configurations. The influence
grows proportionally to the strength of the anchor
alignment model. With the Model 4 intersection
used as the set of anchor alignments, adding syn-
tactic dependency features into the syntax-enhanced
alignment model yields a 5.57% relative decrease in
AER.

5.1.3 Contribution of Different Feature Classes
We interpret the contribution of each feature in
terms of feature weights in SVM model training.
The weights for the most discriminative features in
each feature class in Chinese?English word align-
ment (using HMM intersection as anchor align-
ment) are shown in Table 5. As we can see, all
statistics-based features are informative. Two target
dependency features are informative: ?PRD? denot-
ing ?predicative? dependency, and ?AMOD? denot-
ing ?adjective/adverb modifier? dependency.

5.2 Machine Translation
Research has shown that an increase in AER does
not necessarily imply an improvement in translation
quality (Liang et al, 2006) and vice-versa (Vilar et
al., 2006). Hereafter, we used a Chinese?English
MT task to extrinsically evaluate the quality of our
word alignment.
Table 6 shows the influence of our word align-
ment approach on MT quality.6 On development set,
we achieved statistically significant improvement
using both our syntax-enhanced models?Syntax-
HMM (p<0.002) and Syntax-Model 4 (p<0.008).
On the test set, we observed that the MT output
based on our alignment model tends to be shorter
than the reference translations and the BLEU score
is considerably penalized. If we ignore the length
penalty (?BP? in Table 6) in significance testing, the
improvement on test set is also statistically signif-
icant: p<0.04 for both Syntax-HMM and Syntax-
Model 4. However, an indepth manual analysis
needs to be carried out in order to determine the ex-
act nature of the shorter sentences derived.

Table 6: The Influence of Word Alignment on MT
6 Comparison with Previous Work
Our syntax-enhanced model is a discriminative word
alignment model. Certain generative word align-
ment models (e.g. HMM or IBM 4) also take
the first-order dependencies into account. How-
ever, long distance dependencies between words are
hard to incorporate into these models because of
the explosive number of parameters. On the other
hand, like existing discriminative models, our ap-
proach uses a set of informative features based on
co-occurrence statistics, e.g. log-likelihood ratio
and DICE score. The advantage of our approach is
the mechanism by which syntactic features may be
incorporated.
6Note that the only difference between our MT system and
the baseline PB-SMT system is the word alignment component.
75
Some previous research also tried to make use
of syntax in word alignment. (Wang and Zhou,
2004) investigated the benefit of monolingual pars-
ing for alignment. They learned a generalized word
association measure (crosslingual word similarities)
based on monolingual dependency structures and
improved alignment performances over IBM model
2 and certain heuristic-based models. (Cherry and
Lin, 2006) used dependency structures as soft con-
straints to improve word alignment in an ITG frame-
work. Compared to these models, our approach di-
rectly takes advantage of dependency relations as
they are transformed into feature functions incorpo-
rated into a discriminative word alignment frame-
work.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed a model that can facili-
tate the incorporation of syntax into word alignment
and measured the combination of a set of syntactic
features. Experimental results have shown that syn-
tax is useful in word alignment and especially effec-
tive in improving the recall. We have also observed
that in our word alignment framework, the two sub-
models are closely related and the quality of the an-
chor alignment model plays an important role in the
system performance.
The promising results will lead us to improve our
model in the following aspects. First, the two sub-
models in our approach are two separate processes
performed in pipeline. We plan to jointly optimize
the two models in one go. Second, some of our
experiments used complex IBM models, e.g. IBM
Model 4, to obtain anchor alignment. We plan to
boostrap the alignment using simple heuristics with-
out relying on complex IBM models. Third, the
alignment searching process assumed the alignment
link for each word is made independently. A feasible
markovian assumption will be tested for searching.
Fourth, a comparison with traditional discriminative
word alignment models is also necessary to justify
the merits of our approach. Finally, we also plan to
adapt our approach to larger data sets and more lan-
guage pairs.
