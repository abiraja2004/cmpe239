Abstract
Confidence measures for machine transla-
tion is a method for labeling each word in
an automatically generated translation as
correct or incorrect. In this paper, we will
present a new approach to confidence es-
timation which has the advantage that it
does not rely on system output such as N -
best lists or word graphs as many other
confidence measures do. It is, thus, appli-
cable to any kind of machine translation
system.
Experimental evaluation has been per-
formed on translation of technical manu-
als in three different language pairs. Re-
sults will be presented for different ma-
chine translation systems to show that the
new approach is independent of the under-
lying machine translation system which
generated the translations. To the best
of our knowledge, the performance of the
new confidence measure is better than that
of any existing confidence measure.
1 Introduction
The work presented in this paper deals with con-
fidence estimation for machine translation (MT).
Since sentences produced by a machine translation
system are often incorrect but may contain correct
parts, a method for identifying those correct parts
and finding possible errors is desirable. For this pur-
pose, each word in the generated target sentence is
assigned a value expressing the confidence that it is
correct.
Confidence measures have been extensively stud-
ied for speech recognition, but are not well known
in other areas. Only recently have researchers
started to investigate confidence measures for ma-
chine translation (Blatz et al, 2004; Gandrabur and
Foster, 2003; Quirk, 2004; Ueffing et al, 2003).
We apply word confidence measures in MT as fol-
lows: For a given translation generated by a machine
translation system, we determine a confidence value
for each word and compare it to a threshold. All
words whose confidence is above this threshold are
tagged as correct and all others are tagged as incor-
rect translations. The threshold is optimized on a
distinct development set beforehand.
Possible applications for confidence measures in-
clude
? post-editing, where words with low confidence
could be marked as potential errors,
? improving translation prediction accuracy in
trans-type-style interactive machine transla-
tion (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing and
Ney, 2005),
? combining output from different machine
translation systems: hypotheses with low confi-
dence can be discarded before selecting one of
the system translations (Akiba et al, 2004), or
the word confidence scores can be used for gen-
erating new hypotheses from the output of dif-
ferent systems (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), or
the sentence confidence value can be employed
for re-ranking (Blatz et al, 2003).
In this paper, we will present several approaches
to word-level confidence estimation and develop a
new phrase-based confidence measure which is in-
dependent of the machine translation system which
763
generated the translation. The paper is organized as
follows: In section 2, we will briefly review the sta-
tistical approach to machine translation. The phrase-
based translation system, which serves as basis for
the new confidence measure, will be presented in
section 2.2. Section 3 will give an overview of re-
lated work on confidence estimation for statistical
machine translation (SMT). In section 4, we will
describe methods for confidence estimation which
make use of SMT system output such as word
graphs and N -best lists. In section 5, we will present
the new phrase-based confidence measure. Section 6
contains a short description of an IBM-1 based con-
fidence measure to which we will compare the other
measures. Experimental evaluation and comparison
of the different confidence measures will be shown
in section 7, and section 8 will conclude the paper.
2 Statistical machine translation
2.1 General
In statistical machine translation, the translation is
modeled as a decision process: Given a source string
fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ , we seek the target string eI1 =
e1 . . . ei . . . eI with maximal posterior probability:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1 | fJ1 )
}
(1)
= argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(fJ1 | eI1) ? Pr(eI1)
}
Through this decomposition of the probability, we
obtain two knowledge sources: the translation
model Pr(fJ1 | eI1) and the language model Pr(eI1).
Both of them can be modeled independently of each
other. The translation model is responsible for link-
ing the source string fJ1 and the target string eI1,
i.e. it captures the semantics of the sentence. The
target language model captures the well-formedness
or the syntax in the target language. Nowadays,
most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems are based
on bilingual phrases (Bertoldi et al, 2004; Koehn
et al, 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Tillmann, 2003;
Vogel et al, 2004; Zens and Ney, 2004). Note that
those phrases are sequences of words in the two lan-
guages and not necessarily phrases in the linguistic
sense. A more detailed description of a phrase-based
approach to statistical machine translation will be
given in section 2.2.
2.2 Review of phrase-based translation system
For the confidence measures which will be intro-
duced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrase-
based approach as described in (Zens and Ney,
2004). The key elements of this translation approach
are bilingual phrases, i.e. pairs of source and target
language phrases where a phrase is simply a con-
tiguous sequence of words. These bilingual phrases
are extracted from a word-aligned bilingual training
corpus.
We will present the equations for a mono-
tone search here in order to keep the equa-
tions simple. Let (jK0 , iK0 ) be a segmentation of
the source sentence into phrases, with the cor-
responding (bilingual) phrase pairs (f?k, e?k) =
(f jkjk?1+1, e
ik
ik?1+1), k = 1, . . . ,K. The phrase-
based approach to SMT is then expressed by the fol-
lowing equation:
e?I?1 = argmax
jK0 ,iK0 ,I,eI1
{ I?
i=1
[
c1 ? p(ei | ei?1i?2)?1
]
(2)
?
K?
k=1
[
c2 ? p(f?k | e?k)?2 ? p(e?k | f?k)?3
?
jk?
j=jk?1+1
p(fj | e?k)?4 ?
ik?
i=ik?1+1
p(ei | f?k)?5
]}
,
where p(f?k | e?k) and p(e?k | f?k) are the phrase lexicon
models in both translation directions. The phrase
translation probabilities are computed as a log-linear
interpolation of the relative frequencies and the
IBM-1 probability. The single word based lexicon
models are denoted as p(fj | e?k) and p(ei | f?k), re-
spectively. p(fj | e?k) is defined as the IBM-1 model
probability of fj over the whole phrase e?k, and
p(ei | f?k) is the inverse model, respectively.
c1 is the so-called word penalty, and c2 is the
phrase penalty, assigning constant costs to each tar-
get language word/phrase. The language model
is a trigram model with modified Kneser-Ney dis-
counting and interpolation (Stolcke, 2002). The
search determines the target sentence and segmen-
tation which maximize the objective function.
As equation 2 shows, the sub-models are com-
bined via weighted log-linear interpolation. The
model scaling factors ?1, . . . , ?5 and the word and
phrase penalties are optimized with respect to some
evaluation criterion (Och, 2003), e.g. BLEU score.

3 Confidence measures for SMT
3.1 Related work
In this paper, we will present a new approach to
word-level confidence estimation which makes ex-
plicit use of a phrase-based translation model. Most
of the word-level confidence measures which have
been presented in the literature so far are either
based on relatively simple translation models such
as IBM-1 (Blatz et al, 2003) or make use of infor-
mation provided by the SMT system such as N -best
lists or word graphs (Blatz et al, 2003; Gandrabur
and Foster, 2003; Ueffing et al, 2003). In contrast
to this, our method is based on a state-of-the-art
statistical machine translation model, but neverthe-
less is independent of the machine translation sys-
tem which generates the translation hypotheses.
The word-level confidence measures which
showed the best performance in comparative experi-
ments (Blatz et al, 2003) are word posterior prob-
abilities and the IBM-1 based measure. Our new
confidence measure will be compared to those ap-
proaches in section 7.3.
3.2 Word posterior probabilities
The confidence of a target word can be expressed by
its posterior probability, i.e. the probability of the
word to occur in the target sentence, given the source
sentence. Consider a target word e occurring in the
sentence in position i1. The posterior probability of
this event can be determined by summing over all
possible target sentences eI1 containing the word e in
position i:
pi(e, fJ1 ) =
?
I,eI1: ei=e
p(eI1, fJ1 ) (3)
This value has to be normalized in order to ob-
tain a probability distribution over all possible target
words:
pi(e | fJ1 ) =
pi(e, fJ1 )?
e?
pi(e?, fJ1 )
(4)
1This is a rather strict assumption, because the position of a
word in the target sentence can differ largely due to reorderings
in the translation process. We present this variant here to keep
the notation simple. Improved methods will be shown in the
following sections.
4 System based confidence measures
In this section, we will present confidence measures
which are based on N -best lists or word graphs gen-
erated by the SMT system. Those are representa-
tions of the space of the most likely translations of
the source sentence.
The summation given in equation 3 is performed
over all sentences which are contained in the N -best
list or word graph. For a more detailed description,
see (Ueffing et al, 2003).
4.1 Word graph based approach
The word posterior probability pi(e | fJ1 ) can be
calculated over a word graph using the forward-
backward algorithm.
Let n?, n be nodes in a word graph, and (n?, n) the
directed edge connecting them. The edge is anno-
tated with a target word which we denote by e(n?, n)
and the probability which this word contributes to
the overall sentence probability, denoted by p(n?, n).
The forward probability ?i(n?, n) of an edge is
the probability of reaching this edge from the source
of the graph, where the word e(n?, n) is the i-th word
on the path. It can be obtained by summing the prob-
abilities of all incoming paths of length i? 1, which
allows for recursive calculation. This leads to the
following formula:
?i(n?, n) = p(n?, n) ?
?
n??
?i?1(n??, n?) .
The backward probability expresses the probabil-
ity of completing a sentence from the current edge,
i.e. of reaching the sink of the graph. It can be de-
termined recursively in descending order of i as fol-
lows:
?i(n?, n) = p(n?, n) ?
?
n?
?i+1(n, n?) .
Using the forward-backward algorithm, the word
posterior probability of word e in position i is de-
termined by combining the forward and backward
probabilities of all edges which are annotated with
e. This yields
pi(e, fJ1 ) =
?
(n?,n) : e(n?,n)=e
?i(n?, n) ??i(n?, n)
p(n?, n) . (5)
Note that (for computational reasons) the term
p(n?, n) is included both in the forward and in the
765
backward probability so that we have to divide the
product by this term.
To obtain a posterior probability, a normalization,
as shown in equation 4, has to be performed. The
normalization term ? := ?
e?
pi(e?, fJ1 ) corresponds
to the probability mass contained in the word graph
and can be calculated by summing the backward
probabilities of all outgoing edges leaving the source
s of the graph:
? =
?
(s,n)
?1(s, n) .
As stated above, the position of word e in the tar-
get sentence can vary due to reorderings in the trans-
lation process. Therefore, we would like to relax
the condition that e has to occur exactly in position
i. This can be achieved by introducing a window
of size t over the neighboring target positions and
computing the sum of the word posterior probabili-
ties over all positions i ? t, . . . , i, . . . , i + t. In our
experiments we found that a window over ?3 posi-
tions yields the best performance.
4.2 N -best list based approach
N -best lists are an alternative representation of the
space of translation hypotheses. They have the ad-
vantage that the Levenshtein alignment between a
hypothesis and all sentences contained in the list can
be performed easily. This makes it possible to con-
sider not only target sentences, which contain the
word e exactly in a position i (as given in equa-
tion 3), but to allow for some variation.
Let L(eI1, e?I?1) be the Levenshtein alignment be-
tween sentences eI1 and e?I?1. Then, Li(eI1, e?I?1) denotes
the Levenshtein alignment of word ei, i.e. the word
in sentence e?I?1 which ei is Levenshtein-aligned to.
The word posterior probability is then calculated
by summing over all target sentences containing
word e in a position which is Levenshtein-aligned
to i:
pi(e|fJ1 , I, eI1) =
pi(e, fJ1 , I, eI1)?
e?
pi(e?, fJ1 , I, eI1)
,
where
pi(e, fJ1 , I, eI1) =
?
I?,e?I?1: Li(eI1,e?I?1)=e
p(e?I?1, fJ1 ) . (6)
The confidence of word e then depends on the source
sentence fJ1 as well as the target sentence eI1, be-
cause the whole target sentence is relevant for the
Levenshtein alignment.
5 Phrase-based confidence measures
In contrast to the approaches presented in section 4,
the phrase-based confidence measures do not not use
the context information at the sentence level, but
only at the phrase level. We want to determine a
sort of marginal probability Q(e, fJ1 ). Therefore,
we extract all source phrases f j+sj which occur in
the given source sentence. For such source phrases,
we find the possible translations ei+ti in the bilin-
gual phrase lexicon. The confidence of target word
e is then calculated by summing over all phrase pairs
(f j+sj , ei+ti ) where the target part ei+ti contains the
word e.
Let p(ei+ti ) be the language model score of the
target phrase together with the word penalty c1, i.e.
p(ei+ti ) =
i+t?
i?=i
c1 ? p(ei? | ei??1i??2)?1 .
Analogously, define p(f j+sj , ei+ti ) as the score of the
phrase pair which consists of the phrase penalty and
the phrase and word lexicon model scores (cf. sec-
tion 2.2). Following equation 2, the (unnormalized)
confidence is then determined as:
Q(e, fJ1 ) =
J?
j=1
min{smax,J?j}?
s=0
(7)
?
ei+ti : e ? ei+ti
p(ei+ti ) ? p(f j+sj , ei+ti ) ,
where s ? smax and t are source and target phrase
lengths, smax being the maximal source phrase
length.
In equation 7, the language model only deter-
mines the probability of the words within the tar-
get part of the phrase, and not across the phrase
boundaries, because we consider only the single tar-
get phrases without context. Therefore, we assumed
that the language model would not have much influ-
ence on the confidence estimation and also investi-
gated a model without a language model. The same
holds for word and phrase penalty: In the translation
process they are useful for adjusting the length of the
766
generated target hypothesis and for assigning more
weight to longer phrases. Since this does not make
much sense in our setting, we also investigated con-
fidence estimation without word and phrase penalty.
Note that the value calculated in equation 7 is
not normalized. In order to obtain a word posterior
probability, we divide this value by the sum over the
(unnormalized) confidence of all target words:
pphr(e | fJ1 ) =
Q(e, fJ1 )?
e?
Q(e?, fJ1 )
. (8)
Unlike the word posterior probabilities presented
in the previous section, this value is completely in-
dependent of the target sentence position in which
the word e occurs.
As stated in section 2.2, the scaling factors of the
different sub-models and the penalties in the trans-
lation system are optimized with respect to some
evaluation criterion. But since the values which are
optimal for translation are not necessarily optimal
for confidence estimation, we perform optimization
here as well: We train the probability models on the
training corpus, estimate the word confidences on
the development corpus, and optimize the scaling
factors with respect to the classification error rate
described in section 7.2. The optimization is per-
formed with the Downhill Simplex algorithm (Press
et al, 2002).
6 IBM-1 based approach
Another type of confidence measure which does not
rely on system output and is thus applicable to any
kind of machine translation system is the IBM-1
model based confidence measure which was intro-
duced in (Blatz et al, 2003). We modified this con-
fidence measure because we found that the average
lexicon probability used there is dominated by the
maximum. Therefore, we determine the maximal
translation probability of the target word e over the
source sentence words:
pIBM?1(e|fJ1 ) = maxj=0,...,J p(e|fj) , (9)
where f0 is the ?empty? source word (Brown et al,
1993). The probabilities p(e|fj) are word-based lex-
icon probabilities.
Investigations on the use of the IBM-1 model
for word confidence measures showed promising re-
sults (Blatz et al, 2003; Blatz et al, 2004). Thus,
we apply this method here in order to compare it to
the other types of confidence measures.
7 Experiments
7.1 Experimental setting
The experiments were performed on three different
language pairs. All corpora were compiled in the EU
project TransType2; they consist of technical manu-
als. The corpus statistics are given in table 1. The
SMT systems that the confidence estimation was
performed for were trained on these corpora. The
same holds for the probability models that were used
to estimate the word confidences.
We used several (S)MT systems for testing the
confidence measures. A detailed analysis will be
given for two of them; the so-called alignment tem-
plate system (Och and Ney, 2004), (denoted as AT
in the tables) and the phrase-based translation sys-
tem described in section 2.2 (denoted as PBT in the
tables). They are both state-of-the-art SMT systems.
We produced single best translations, word graphs
and N -best lists on all three language pairs using
these systems. The translation quality in terms of
WER, PER (position independent word error rate),
BLEU and NIST score is given in tables 2 and 3.
We see that the best results are obtained on Spanish
to English translation, followed by French to English
and German to English.
Two more translation systems were used for com-
parative experiments: One is a statistical MT system
which is based on a finite state architecture (FSA).
For a description of this system, see (Kanthak et al,
2005). Additionally, we used translations generated
by Systran2. Table 3 presents the translation error
rates and scores for all systems on the German ?
English test corpus. These hypotheses were used
to investigate whether the phrase-based confidence
measures perform well independently of the transla-
tion system.
All three SMT systems (AT, PBT and FSA) show
very similar performance on the German ? English
test corpus. The fact that Systran generates transla-
tions of much lower quality is due to the fact that the
technical manuals are very specific in terminology,
and the SMT systems have been trained on similar
corpora.

To determine the true class of each word in a gen-
erated translation hypothesis, we use the word er-
ror rate (WER). That is, a target word is considered
correct if it is aligned to itself in the Levenshtein
alignment between hypothesis and reference trans-
lation(s). We also investigated PER based classifi-
cation, but since the tendencies of the results were
similar, we omit them here.
7.2 Evaluation metrics
After computing the confidence measure, each gen-
erated word is tagged as either correct or false, de-
pending on whether its confidence exceeds the tag-
ging threshold that has been optimized on the devel-
opment set beforehand. The performance of the con-
fidence measure is evaluated using the Classification
Error Rate (CER). This is defined as the number of
incorrect tags divided by the total number of gener-
ated words in the translated sentence. The baseline
CER is determined by assigning the most frequent
class to all translations. In the case that the most fre-
quent class is ?correct? (meaning at least half of the
words in the generated translation are correct w.r.t.
to WER), this is the number of substitutions and in-
sertions, divided by the number of generated words.
The CER strongly depends on the tagging threshold.
Therefore, the tagging threshold is adjusted before-
hand (to minimize CER) on a development corpus
distinct to the test set.
7.3 Experimental results
Table 4 shows the performance of all different con-
fidence measures on the hypotheses generated by
the alignment template system and the phrase-based
system. For the baseline CER, we determined the
90%- and 99%-confidence intervals using the boot-
strap estimation method described in (Bisani and
Ney, 2004)3. We see that, in all settings but one, the
word graph and the N -best list based method out-
perform the IBM-1 based confidence measure. On
French ? English, the improvement over the base-
line is significant at the 1%-level for these methods,
whereas on Spanish ? English this is only the case
at 10%. The performance of the N -best list based
approach is better than that of the word graph based

confidence measures for the alignment template sys-
tem. This is probably due to the fact that the former
can take the Levenshtein alignment into account and
thus estimate the word confidence more reliably.
The phrase-based confidence measures show a
performance which is clearly better than that of the
other methods. We obtain a relative improvement of
up to 7.8% over the best existing method on these
language pairs. The improvement over the baseline
is significant even at the 1%-level in all cases.
When analyzing the impact of the different sub-
models in the phrase-based approach, we found that
the language model does not have much impact on
the confidence estimation. There are only slight
variations in the CER if the model is omitted. The
word and phrase penalty on the other hand seem to
be important (with one exception in the first setting).
The evaluation of the system-independent confi-
dence measures (i.e. those based on IBM-1 and
the new phrase-based method we presented) for four
different translation systems is shown in table 5. We
see that, for all of them, the phrase-based approach
outperforms the IBM-1 based method significantly.
The largest gain in terms of CER is achieved for the
Systran translations: 23.8% relative over the IBM-1
based measure.
8 Conclusion and outlook
We presented a new approach to word-level con-
fidence estimation for machine translation which
makes use of bilingual phrases. By using models
from a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation system, the word confidences are
estimated only on the basis of single best system
output. Unlike other confidence measures, this does
not rely on information from the machine translation
system which generated the translation.
Experimental evaluation on three different lan-
guage pairs and on output from structurally differ-
ent translation systems showed that the new confi-
dence measures perform better than existing confi-
dence measures in all cases. The application on out-
put from different MT systems yielded a significant
reduction of the error rate over the existing mea-
sures. This proves that the method is well-suited for
word confidence estimation on statistical as well as
non-statistical MT systems.
The task investigated in this work was a text trans-
lation task in the domain of technical manuals. We
are currently investigating the use of word-level con-
fidence measures on data from the European parlia-
ment. It will be interesting to see whether a similar
performance can be achieved on this large vocabu-
lary speech translation task.
