Abstract
We present a series of simulations of behavioral data
by casting a simple parsing model in the cognitive
architecture ACT-R. We show that constraints de-
fined in ACT-R, specifically those relating to acti-
vation, can account for a range of facts about hu-
man sentence processing. In doing so, we argue
that resource limitation in working memory is bet-
ter defined as an artefact of very general and in-
dependently motivated principles of cognitive pro-
cessing.
1 Introduction
Although language processing may be a specialized
cognitive faculty, it is possible that it is nevertheless
shaped by general constraints on the human cog-
nitive architecture. This point has been addressed
extensively in the connectionist literature, but we
present a somewhat different approach to this prob-
lem by casting parsing within the cognitive architec-
ture ACT-R (Anderson et al, 2002) and directly us-
ing the constraints provided in ACT-R to account for
several interesting cross-linguistic facts: the well-
known sentential complement/relative clause asym-
metry (Gibson, 2000; Grodner and Gibson, 2003)
and the subject/object relative clause asymmetry in
English (Homes and O?Regan, 1981); and some re-
cent results (Vasishth, 2003) involving Hindi center
embeddings, including a principled account of indi-
vidual variation in subject behavior.
In developing this approach, we argue that re-
source limitation in working memory is better de-
fined as an artefact of very general constraints on
information processing ? specifically, rehearsal and
activation ? rather than as an inherent numerical
bound on memory capacity (cf. (Gibson, 2000;
Hawkins, 1994); also see Section 3.5).
In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the
ACT-R architecture. Then we present the results
of several simulations of experiments available in
the psycholinguistic literature. The paper concludes
with a discussion of the potential advantages and
shortcomings of this approach, and of the broader
consequences of modeling parsing within a cogni-
tive architecture.
2 A brief introduction to the cognitive
architecture ACT-R
ACT-R is a theory of the human cognitive archi-
tecture. It allows the development of computa-
tional models that can closely simulate experimental
methodologies such as eye-tracking and self-paced
reading, and has been used to model a wide array of
behavioral data from learning and memory, problem
solving and decision making, language and commu-
nication, perception and attention, cognitive devel-
opment, and individual differences (Anderson et al,
2002).
The ACT-R architecture is attractive as a model-
ing tool for three reasons. First, it is based on a wide
array of empirical results in various domains of cog-
nitive psychology. Second, it is flexible enough to
permit the modeler to add their own assumptions
and theories about the specific task to be modeled.
Finally, ACT-R models yield dependent measures
such as reading time in much the same way as hu-
mans performing the experiment; e.g., the system
can easily be programmed to simulate key presses
after it processes material presented on the screen.
As shown in Figure 1, the architecture consists of
several MODULES such as Declarative, Visual, and
Manual. Each module is associated with a BUFFER
which temporarily stores information for a given ac-
tion. For example, the visual buffer is used to store
an item ?seen? by the system in the environment be-
fore it is used in the service of some task.
The module that is especially important for the
present paper is the Declarative (henceforth, DM).
DM represents permanent memory: every fact that
is assumed to be known is encoded as a CHUNK in
declarative memory. A chunk is an attribute-value
list structure with a special attribute, ISA, which de-
fines its type. The attributes are also referred to as
slots. The value of a chunk?s slot is also (by defi-
nition) a chunk, unless it is double-quoted or is the

lisp primitive ?nil?.
Each DM chunk has an activation that determines
its speed of retrieval, and the probability that it will
be retrieved; the initial activation for a given chunk
can be set manually.
There is a GOAL BUFFER that holds a current goal
under consideration (there can be only one goal at
one time); this goal is a chunk with a given type and
possibly instantiated slots.
The control structure for modeling a sequence of
events is a set of PRODUCTIONS; a production is
simply an if-then statement of the following general
form: for a given state of one or more buffers and/or
DM, execute some actions. Examples of executing
actions are retrieving something from DM; chang-
ing a value in one of the goal?s slots; repositioning
the hand over a keyboard; a visual shift of attention;
changing the goal to a new one, etc. If the goal is
changed, then this new goal now occupies the goal
buffer.
Building an ACT-R model is essentially a defi-
nition of possible sequences of actions for a given
state of affairs. Events like retrievals from DM are
triggered by looking at the contents of one or more
buffers. For example, the ACT-R system ?sees? an
item/object on the screen and then encodes it as a vi-
sual chunk. This chunk can then be harvested from
the visual buffer; it includes (as slot-value specifi-
cations) information about the content of the item
seen, its x-y coordinates, etc. One can define an ac-
tion based on this information, such as retrieving a
chunk from DM.
3 Modeling sentence parsing in ACT-R
Previous research suggests that humans employ
some variant of left-corner parsing (see, e.g.,
(Resnik, 1992)), which in essence involves a
bottom-up and a top-down (predictive) step. We
adopt this parsing strategy in the simulations. In
order to model the prediction of syntactic struc-
ture based on incrementally appearing input, we as-
sume that sentence structure templates are available
in declarative memory as underspecified chunks.
These chunks are retrieved every time a new word is
integrated into the structure, as are prior arguments
necessary for semantic integration.
We illustrate the parsing process with a simple
example (Figure 2). Suppose that the sentence to be
parsed is The girl ran, and suppose that we are sim-
ulating self-paced reading (Just et al, 1982). When
the word the is seen, a bottom-up and top-down
structure building step results in a sentence with an
intransitive verb being predicted. This structure be-
comes the current goal. Then the word girl is seen
and processed, i.e., its lexical entry is retrieved from
declarative memory. The noun slot in the goal is
then instantiated with that lexical entry. In the next
step, if the word ran is seen the relevant lexical item
for the verb is retrieved and instantiated with the
verb slot of the goal; here, the verb?s argument is
also retrieved and integrated with the subcategoriza-
tion frame of the verb. If, instead of ran the word
that appears, a new goal is created, with any pre-
viously instantiated slots of the preceding goal be-
ing passed on to the new goal, and parsing proceeds
from there.
Each retrieval of a goal from memory results in
a surge in its activation, so that repeated retrievals
result in increased activation; and the higher the ac-
tivation of an item the faster it is processed. At the
same time, activation decays according to the power
law of forgetting (Anderson et al, 2002). In the
same way that the goals undergo decay and reacti-
vation, so do the previously seen words. This means
that the speed of retrieval of a previously seen argu-
ment at a verb will be determined by the activation
level of that argument. Thus, the activation of both
the goals (predicted structures) and the arguments
affect processing.
In our simulations, for simplicity we code in the
exact steps that ACT-R takes for particular sen-
tences. Although it is feasible to build a very gen-

eral parser in pure ACT-R, before doing this we
wanted to first establish whether ACT-R?s reacti-
vation mechanisms can account for a reasonable
array of facts from the sentence processing litera-
ture. In (Lewis and Vasishth, An activation-based
model of sentence processing as skilled memory re-
trieval, (tentative title; in preparation)) we provide
a detailed description of a model employing mech-
anisms similar to those described here, but one that
behaves more like a standard parser.
3.1 English subject versus object relative
clauses
It is well known (Homes and O?Regan, 1981) that
English subject relatives are easier to process that
object relatives (1). In the parsing model outlined
above, we can model this result without changing
any ACT-R parameters at all (i.e., we use the default
settings for the parameters).
(1) a. The reporter who sent the photographer
to the editor hoped for a good story.
b. The reporter who the photographer sent
to the editor hoped for a good story.
The explanation comes from the decay of the ar-
guments of the verb sent: in object relatives the
argument reporter decays much more than in the
subject relative by the time it is integrated with the
verb?s subcategorization frame (Figure 3). This is
because more time elapses between the argument
being first seen and its retrieval at the verb.1
1A reviewer points out that several head-final languages
such as German and Dutch also have a subject relative pref-
erence and in these languages the activation level cannot be the
explanation. We do not claim that decay is the only constraint
operating in parsing; frequency effects (greater preference for

Figure 3: The reading times provided by the model.
Retrieval of reporter at sent is harder in the object
relative because of increased argument decay.
3.2 The SC/RC asymmetry in English
It is also well-known (Gibson, 2000) that a senten-
tial complement (SC) followed by a relative clause
(RC) is easier to process than an RC followed by an
SC:
(2) a. The fact that the employee who the
manager hired stole office supplies wor-
ried the executive.
b. #The executive who the fact that the
employee stole office supplies worried
hired the manager.
As in the previous discussion about relative
clauses, in the harder case the decay of the argument
executive at the verb worried is greater compared
to the decay of the argument employee at hired in
the easier-to-process sentence. In addition, the to-
tal reading time for the harder sentence is about 120
msec longer.2
3.3 Hindi center embeddings
Previous work (Hakes, 1972), (Konieczny, 2000)
has shown that if argument-verb distance is in-
creased, processing is easier at the verb. (Vasishth,
more frequently occurring subject relatives) etc. could certainly
dominate where the amount of decay is constant in subject and
object relatives. It is an open empirical question whether fre-
quency alone can account for the subject/object asymmetry in
English, but given that we have independent empirical justi-
fication for decay (see Section 3.5), the above is a plausible
explanation.
2As a reviewer points out, ?the account in terms of acti-
vation decay suggests that the SC/RC asymmetry can be an-
nihilated or even reversed by inserting longer or shorter NPs
between the critical verbs (worried, hired) and their arguments
(executive, employee). This seems unrealistic.? This is surely
an empirical question that needs to be verified experimentally;
we intend to pursue this very interesting issue in future work.

In all the ?insertion? cases a statistically signifi-
cant speedup was observed at the verb, compared to
the baseline condition.
This experiment?s results were replicated in the
ACT-R system; the replication is based on the as-
sumption that the goal (predicted syntactic struc-
ture) is reactivated each time it (i.e., the entire pre-
dicted structure) is modified. The intervening items
result in an extra retrieval compared to the base-
line, resulting in faster processing at the verb. In
this model, one parameter was changed: the rate of
decay of items. We justify this change in the next
sub-section.
The modeling results are shown in Figure 5.

3.4 Individual variation in Hindi center
embedding data
In the Hindi experiment, there was a further varia-
tion in the data when individual subjects? data were
considered: only about 48% of subjects showed a
speedup at the verb. About 21% showed a slow-
down and there was only a few milliseconds differ-
ence (essentially no difference) in the reading times
for about 31% of the subjects. The observed varia-
tion was a systematic trend in the sense that the 47%
of the subjects who showed a speedup or slowdown
in adverb-insertion case also showed the same trend
in the PP- and RC-inserted cases ? the probability of
this happening is considerably below chance level.
The rate of decay defined in ACT-R?s rehearsal
equation can systematically explain this variation.

tial activation of  is retrieved. The activation is

3.5 Comparison with other models
The model presented here is very different in con-
ception from existing models of sentence process-
ing. For example, consider Early Immediate Con-
sistuents (Hawkins, 1994) and Discourse Locality
Theory (Gibson, 2000), two theories with signif-
icant empirical coverage. Both theories propose
variants of what we will call the distance hypothe-
sis: increasing the distance between arguments and
a subsequently appearing verb (head) that selects
for them results in increased processing difficulty at
the verb. Distance here is quantified in terms of the
number of words in a constituent (EIC) or the num-
ber of new discourse referents introduced between
the arguments and head (DLT).
The present model claims that distance effects
are actually a result of argument decay. Prelimi-
nary evidence that it is really decay and not EIC-
or DLT-defined distance comes from a recent self-
paced listening experiment (Vasishth et al, 2004) in
which two conditions were contrasted: arguments
and verbs with (a) an adjunct intervening, (b) si-
lence:

an adjunct containing two4 discourse referents (5a);
or by silence (5b). Subjects were allowed to inter-
rupt the silence and continue listening to the rest of
the sentence whenever they wanted to. Subjects in-
terruped the silence (on an average) after about 1.4
seconds.
Distance based theories predict that having an in-
tervening adjunct that introduces discourse referents
should result in greater processing difficulty at the
verb dekhaa, ?saw?, compared to when silence in-
tervenes. If decay rather than distance is the critical
factor here that affects processing, then there should
be greater difficulty at the verb in the silence con-
dition than when in the items intervene (see Sec-
tion 3.3 for why intervening items may facilitate
processing). The results support the activation ac-
count: introducing silence results in significantly
longer reading times at the verb dekhaa than when
intervening items occur.
4 Conclusion
These modeling efforts suggest that very general
constraints on information processing can provide
a principled account of parsing phenomena, and
also brings human sentence parsing in closer con-
tact with models of human working memory in cog-
nitive psychology (Miyake and Shah, 1999).
There are of course certain potential limitations
in the work presented here. Several alternative hy-
potheses remain to be explored, e.g., the role of
competence grammar and its own (possibly theory-
internal) operations on processing; the role of expe-
rience (Crocker and Brants, 2000), etc. However,
the present research is a necessary first step since it
provides a basis for such a comparison.
Secondly, there are specific assumptions in the
model that may be controversial. For example, we
assume that entire sentence structures are predicted
as goal chunks, and not verb-types (cf. (Konieczny,
2000)). We are conducting further experiments to
explore the predictions made by different assump-
tions.
Finally, we have used toy simulations to ex-
plore the ACT-R constraint-interaction space, the
task of scaling up such a model to parse essentially
any kind of input is necessary, but still in the fu-
ture. However, we believe that the results presented
are suggestive of the way in which a cognitively-
oriented parser could be constructed.

referent.
