PROJECT GOALS 
Work under this grant is intended to provide lexical 
resources for research on natural anguages. The principal 
product is WordNet, a lexical database for English whose 
organization is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories 
of human lexical knowledge. Lexicalized concepts are 
organized by semantic relations for nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
and adverbs. 
The principal goal of the project is to upgrade WordNet and 
make it available to interested users. A secondary goal is to 
explore practical applications of WordNet; its possible use 
in the resolution of word senses in context (semantic disam- 
biguation) is viewed as a necessary precursor for many other 
applications. 
RECENT RESULTS 
WordNet Upgrade, The basic elements of WordNet are 
sets of synonyms (synsets), which are taken to represent lex- 
icalized concepts. The database is organized by bi- 
directional pointers between synsets which correpond to 
familiar semantic relations: (synonymy, antonymy, hypo- 
nymy, meronymy, troponymy, entailment, etc.). During the 
past year the number of entries (words and collocations) in 
WordNet has grown from 62,700 to 82,600; the number of 
lexicalized concepts (synsets) from 50,300 to 62,700; the 
number of unique word-sense combinations from 98,300 to 
117,300; and the number of synsets that include definitional 
glosses from 20,700 to 39,400. The syntactic ategory of 
adverb has been added; there are now 1,200 adverb synsets. 
Software Development and Distribution. WordNet is 
available to the research community via anonymous ftp or 
on diskettes for PC users. A fourth version of the database, 
WordNet 1.3, was released 9 December 1992; notices were 
sent to 175 individuals and laboratories who had previously 
expressed interest. An X-windows interface that includes a 
program to recognize inflectional morphology is available 
for Sun SPARCstations; interfaces are also available for 
DECstations, NEXT, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh.

Sense Resolution. A corpus of sentences using the noun 
"l ine" in different senses has been compiled and used to 
compare different methods of automatically determining 
from context which sense was intended. Preliminary efforts 
have been made to explore the use of WordNet o generalize 
the contexts that emerge from such studies. 
Semantie Tagging. In support of the studies of sense reso- 
lution, a portion of the Brown Corpus has been tagged with 
pointers to WordNet. The result is a semantic oncordance: 
a textual corpus and a lexicon so combined that every sub- 
stantive word in the text is linked to its appropriate sense in 
the lexicon. To facilitate the task, an X-windows interface, 
ConText, has been developed that displays the text along 
with the WordNet entry for each content word; the user 
selects the appropriate sense, or inserts a comment that is 
used by the lexicographers to upgrade WordNet. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
WordNet will continue to be expanded and improved, and 
made available to interested users. There is interest in 
including more syntactic information, although that step 
would probably require formulating WordNet as a relational 
database. We have been considering that move for some 
time, but have lacked the necessary personnel. We are also 
considering how to incorporate more syntactic information 
in the output of ConText, and have secured permission from 
IBM to use McCord's English Slot Grammar on an experi- 
mental basis. 
We plan to collect more systematic data on the adequacy of 
WordNet. The use of WordNet for semantic tagging pro- 
vides a valuable test of its coverage and precision; the per- 
centage of words in a text that are either missing or are used 
to express enses not included in WordNet fluctuates radi- 
cally depending on the topic of a passage, but the average 
should decline steadily as the work proceeds. By summer 
1993 we expect o be able to release an initial corpus of 
semantically tagged passages to authorized users of the 
Brown Corpus. 
We are also developing a method to analyze the co- 
occurrences of concepts in the same sentences, in the expec- 
tation that such information will facilitate sense resolution. 
The value of such analyses will guide us in deciding how 
much farther to proceed with the construction of a semantic 
concordance based on the Brown Corpus.
