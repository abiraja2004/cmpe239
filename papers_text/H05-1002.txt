Abstract
This paper investigates automatic identi-
fication of Information Structure (IS) in
texts. The experiments use the Prague
Dependency Treebank which is annotated
with IS following the Praguian approach
of Topic Focus Articulation. We auto-
matically detect t(opic) and f(ocus), us-
ing node attributes from the treebank as
basic features and derived features in-
spired by the annotation guidelines. We
present the performance of decision trees
(C4.5), maximum entropy, and rule in-
duction (RIPPER) classifiers on all tec-
togrammatical nodes. We compare the re-
sults against a baseline system that always
assigns f(ocus) and against a rule-based
system. The best system achieves an ac-
curacy of 90.69%, which is a 44.73% im-
provement over the baseline (62.66%).
1 Introduction
Information Structure (IS) is a partitioning of the
content of a sentence according to its relation to
the discourse context. There are numerous theo-
retical approaches describing IS and its semantics
(Halliday, 1967; Sgall, 1967; Vallduv??, 1990; Steed-
man, 2000) and the terminology used is diverse ?
see (Kruijff-Korbayova? and Steedman, 2003) for an
overview. However, all theories consider at least one
of the following two distinctions: (i) a Topic/Focus1
distinction that divides the linguistic meaning of the
sentence into parts that link the sentence content
? We use the Praguian terminology for this distinction.
to the discourse context, and other parts that ad-
vance the discourse, i.e., add or modify informa-
tion; and (ii) a background/kontrast2 distinction be-
tween parts of the utterance which contribute to dis-
tinguishing its actual content from alternatives the
context makes available.
Information Structure is an important factor in de-
termining the felicity of a sentence in a given con-
text. Applications in which IS is crucial are text-
to-speech systems, where IS helps to improve the
quality of the speech output (Prevost and Steedman,
1994; Kruijff-Korbayova? et al, 2003; Moore et al,
2004), and machine translation, where IS improves
target word order, especially that of free word order
languages (Stys and Zemke, 1995).
Existing theories, however, state their principles
using carefully selected illustrative examples. Be-
cause of this, they fail to adequately explain how
different linguistic dimensions cooperate to realize
Information Structure.
In this paper we describe data-driven, machine
learning approaches for automatic identification of
Information Structure; we describe what aspects of
IS we deal with and report results of the performance
of our systems and make an error analysis. For our
experiments, we use the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) (Hajic?, 1998). PDT follows the theory
of Topic-Focus Articulation (Hajic?ova? et al, 1998)
and to date is the only corpus annotated with IS.
Each node of the underlying structure of sentences
in PDT is annotated with a TFA value: t(opic), dif-
ferentiated in contrastive and non-contrastive, and
f(ocus). Our system identifies these two TFA val-
ues automatically. We trained three different clas-

duv?? and Vilkuna, 1998) to replace what Steedman calls ?fo-
cus?, and to avoid confusion with other definitions of focus.

sifiers, C4.5, RIPPER and MaxEnt using basic fea-
tures from the treebank and derived features inspired
by the annotation guidelines. We evaluated the per-
formance of the classifiers against a baseline sys-
tem that simulates the preprocessing procedure that
preceded the manual annotation of PDT, by always
assigning f(ocus), and against a rule-based system
which we implemented following the annotation in-
structions. Our best system achieves a 90.69% accu-
racy, which is a 44.73% improvement over the base-
line (62.66%).
The organization of the paper is as follows.
Section 2 describes the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank and the Praguian approach of Topic-Focus Ar-
ticulation, from two perspectives: of the theoreti-
cal definition and of the annotation guidelines that
have been followed to annotate the PDT. Section 3
presents our experiments, the data settings, results
and error analysis. The paper closes with conclu-
sions and issues for future research (Section 4).
2 Prague Dependency Treebank
The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) consists of
newspaper articles from the Czech National Corpus
( ?Cerma?k, 1997) and includes three layers of annota-
tion:
1. The morphological layer gives a full mor-
phemic analysis in which 13 categories are
marked for all sentence tokens (including punc-
tuation marks).
2. The analytical layer, on which the ?surface?
syntax (Hajic?, 1998) is annotated, contains an-
alytical tree structures, in which every token
from the surface shape of the sentence has a
corresponding node labeled with main syntac-
tic functions like SUBJ, PRED, OBJ, ADV.
3. The tectogrammatical layer renders the deep
(underlying) structure of the sentence (Sgall et
al., 1986; Hajic?ova? et al, 1998). Tectogram-
matical tree structures (TGTSs) contain nodes
corresponding only to the autosemantic words
of the sentence (e.g., no preposition nodes) and
to deletions on the surface level; the condi-
tion of projectivity is obeyed, i.e., no cross-
ing edges are allowed; each node of the tree is
assigned a functor such as ACTOR, PATIENT,
ADDRESSEE, ORIGIN, EFFECT, the repertoire
of which is very rich; elementary coreference
links are annotated for pronouns.
2.1 Topic-Focus Articulation (TFA)
The tectogrammatical level of the PDT was moti-
vated by the ever increasing need for large corpora to
include not only morphological and syntactic infor-
mation but also semantic and discourse-related phe-
nomena. Thus, the tectogrammatical trees have been
enriched with features indicating the information
structure of sentences which is a means of showing
their contextual potential.
In the Praguian approach to IS, the content of the
sentence is divided into two parts: the Topic is ?what
the sentence is about? and the Focus represents the
information asserted about the Topic. A prototypical
declarative sentence asserts that its Focus holds (or
does not hold) about its Topic: Focus(Topic) or not-
Focus(Topic).
The TFA definition uses the distinction between
Context-Bound (CB) and Non-Bound (NB) parts of
the sentence. To distinguish which items are CB and
which are NB, the question test is applied, (i.e., the
question for which a given sentence is the appropri-
ate answer is considered). In this framework, weak
and zero pronouns and those items in the answer
which reproduce expressions present in the question
(or associated to those present) are CB. Other items
are NB.
In example (1), (b) is the sentence under investi-
gation, in which CB and NB items are marked. Sen-
tence (a) is the context in which the sentence (b) is
uttered, and sentence (c) is the question for which
the sentence (b) is an appropriate answer:
(1) (a) Tom and Mary both came to John?s party.
(b) John
CB
invited
CB
only
NB
her
NB
.
(c) Whom did John invite?
It should be noted that the CB/NB distinction is
not equivalent to the given/new distinction, as the
pronoun ?her? is NB although the cognitive entity,
Mary, has already been mentioned in the discourse
(therefore is given).
The following rules determine which lexical items
(CB or NB) belong to the Topic or to the Focus of the
sentence (Hajic?ova? et al, 1998; Hajic?ova? and Sgall,
2001):
10
1. The main verb and any of its direct dependents
belong to the Focus if they are NB;
2. Every item that does not depend directly on the
main verb and is subordinated to a Focus el-
ement belongs to the Focus (where ?subordi-
nated to? is defined as the irreflexive transitive
closure of ?depend on?);
3. If the main verb and all its dependents are CB,
then those dependents di of the verb which
have subordinated items sm that are NB are
called ?proxi foci?; the items sm together with
all items subordinated to them belong to the Fo-
cus (i,m > 1);
4. Every item not belonging to the Focus accord-
ing to 1 ? 3 belongs to the Topic.
Applying these rules for the sentence (b) in exam-
ple (1) we find the Topic and the Focus of the sen-
tence: [John invited]Topic [only her]Focus.
It is worth mentioning that although most of the
time, CB items belong to the Topic and NB items
belong to the Focus (as it happens in our exam-
ple too), there may be cases when the Focus con-
tains some NB items and/or the Topic contains some
CB items. Figure 1 shows such configurations: in
the top-left corner the tectogrammatical representa-
tion of sentence (1) (b) is presented together with
its Topic-Focus partitioning. The other three con-
figurations are other possible tectogrammatical trees
with their Topic-Focus partitionings; the top-right
one corresponds to the example (2), the bottom-left
to (3), and bottom-right to (4).

2.2 TFA annotation
Within PDT, the TFA attribute has been annotated
for all nodes (including the restored ones) from the
tectogrammatical level. Instructions for the assign-
ment of the TFA attribute have been specified in
Figure 1: Topic-Focus partitionings of tectogram-
matical trees.
(Bura?n?ova? et al, 2000) and are summarized in Ta-
ble 1. These instructions are based on the surface
word order, the position of the sentence stress (into-
nation center ? IC)3 and the canonical order of the
dependents.
The TFA attribute has three values:
1. t ? for non-contrastive CB items;
2. f ? for NB items;
3. c ? for contrastive CB items.
In this paper, we do not distinguish between con-
trastive and non-contrastive items, considering both
of them as being just t. In the PDT annotation, the
notation t (from topic) and f (from focus) was chosen
to be used because, as we mentioned earlier, in the
most common cases and in prototypical sentences,
t-items belong to the Topic and f-items to the Focus.
Prior the manual annotation, the PDT corpus was
preprocessed to mark all nodes with the TFA at-
tribute of f, as it is the most common value. Then
the annotators corrected the value according to the
guidelines in Table 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the tectogramatical tree struc-
ture of the following sentence:
(5) Sebeve?dom??m
self-confidence
votroku?
bastards
to
it
ale
but
neotr?a?slo.
not shake
?But it did not shake the self-confidence of those bas-
tards?.
? In the PDT the intonation center is not annotated. However,
the annotators were instructed to use their judgement where
the IC would be if they uttered the sentence.
11
1. The bearer of the IC (typically, the rightmost child of the verb) f
2. If IC is not on the rightmost child, everything after IC t
3. A left-side child of the verb (unless it carries IC) t
4. The verb and the right children of the verb before the f-node (cf. 1) that are canon-
ically ordered
f
5. Embedded attributes (unless repeated or restored) f
6. Restored nodes t
7. Indexical expressions (ja? I, ty you, te?d now, tady here), weak pronouns, pronominal
expressions with a general meaning (ne?kdo somebody, jednou once) (unless they
carry IC)
t
8. Strong forms of pronouns not preceded by a preposition (unless they carry IC) t
Table 1: Annotation guidelines; IC = Intonation Center.
Each node is labeled with the corresponding word?s
lemma, the TFA attribute, and the functor attribute.
For example, votroku? has lemma votrok, the TFA at-
tribute f, and the functor APP (appurtenance).
Figure 2: Tectogramatical tree annotated with t/f.
In order to measure the consistency of the annota-
tion, Interannotator Agreement has been measured
(Vesela? et al, 2004).4 During the annotation pro-
cess, there were four phases in which parallel anno-
tations have been performed; a sample of data was
chosen and annotated in parallel by three annotators.
AGREEMENT 1 2 3 4 AVG
t/c/f 81.32 81.89 76.21 89.57 82.24
t/f 85.42 83.94 84.18 92.15 86.42

ment in PDT 2.0.
The agreement for each of the four phases, as well
as an average agreement, is shown in Table 2. The
second row of the table displays the percentage of
nodes for which all three annotators assigned the

same TFA value (be it t, c or f). Because in our
experiments we do not differentiate between t and c,
considering both as t, we computed, in the last row
of the table, the agreement between the three anno-
tators after replacing the TFA value c with t.5
3 Identification of topic and focus
In this section we present data-driven, machine
learning approaches for automatic identification of
Information Structure. For each tectogrammatical
node we detect the TFA value t(opic) or f(ocus) (that
is CB or NB). With these values one can apply the
rules presented in Subsection 2.1 in order to find the
Topic-Focus partitioning of each sentence.
3.1 Experimental settings
Our experiments use the tectogrammatical trees
from The Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0.6 Statis-
tics of the experimental data are shown in Table 3.
Our goal is to automatically label the tectogram-
matical nodes with topic or focus. We built ma-
chine learning models based on three different well
known techniques, decision trees (C4.5), rule induc-
tion (RIPPER) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), in
order to find out which approach is the most suitable
for our task. For C4.5 and RIPPER we use the Weka
implementations (Witten and Frank, 2000) and for
MaxEnt we use the openNLP package.7
? In (Vesela? et al, 2004), the number of cases when the anno-
tators disagreed when labeling t or c is reported; this allowed
us to compute the t/f agreement, by disregarding this number.
? We are grateful to the researchers at the Charles University in
Prague for providing us the data before the PDT 2.0 official
release.

Table 3: PDT data: Statistics for the training, devel-
opment and evaluation sets.
All our models use the same set of 35 features (pre-
sented in detail in Appendix A), divided in two
types:
1. Basic features, consisting of attributes of the
tectogrammatical nodes whose values were
taken directly from the treebank annotation.
We used a total of 25 basic features, that may
have between 2 and 61 values.
2. Derived features, inspired by the annotation
guidelines. The derived features are computed
using the dependency information from the tec-
togrammatical level of the treebank and the
surface order of the words corresponding to
the nodes.8 We also used lists of forms of
Czech pronouns that are used as weak pro-
nouns, indexical expressions, pronouns with
general meaning, or strong pronouns. All the
derived features have boolean values.
3.2 Results
The classifiers were trained on 494,759 instances
(78.3%) (cf. Table 3) (tectogrammatical nodes) from
the training set. The performance of the classifiers
was evaluated on 70,323 instances (11.2%) from the
evaluation set. We compared our models against a
baseline system that assigns focus to all nodes (as it
is the most common value) and against a determinis-
tic, rule-based system, that implements the instruc-
tions from the annotation guidelines.
Table 4 shows the percentages of correctly classi-
fied instances for our models. We also performed a

nodes.

racy of 90.62%.

Table 4: Correctly classified instances (the numbers
are given as percentages). ?The RIPPER classifier
was trained with only 40% of the training data.
The baseline value is considerably high due to the
topic/focus distribution in the test set (a similar dis-
tribution characterizes the training set as well). The
rule-based system performs very poorly, although it
follows the guidelines according to which the data
was annotated. This anomaly is due to the fact that
the intonation center of the sentence, which plays a
very important role in the annotation, is not marked
in the corpus, thus the rule-based system doesn?t
have access to this information.
The results show that all three models perform
much better than the baseline and the rule-based sys-
tem. We used the ?? test to examine if the dif-
ference between the three classifiers is statistically
significant. The C4.5 model significantly outper-
forms the MaxEnt model (?? = 113.9, p < 0.001)
and the MaxEnt model significantly outperforms the
RIPPER model although with a lower level of confi-
dence (?? = 9.1, p < 0.01).
The top of the decision tree generated by C4.5 in
the training phase looks like this:
coref = true
| is_member = true
| | POS = ...
| is_member = false
| | is_rightmost = ...
coref = false
| is_generated = true
| | nodetype = ...
| is_generated = false
| | iterativeness = ...
It is worth mentioning that the RIPPER classifier
was built with only 40% of the training set (with
more data, the system crashes due to insufficient
memory). Interestingly and quite surprisingly, the
values of all three classifiers are actually greater than
the interannotator agreement which has an average
of 86.42%.
What is the cause of the classifiers? success? How
come that they perform better than the annotators
themselves? Is it because they take advantage of a
13
large amount of training data? To answer this ques-
tion we have computed the learning curves. They
are shown in the figure 3, which shows that, actu-
ally, after using only 1% of the training data (4,947
instances), the classifiers already perform very well,
and adding more training data improves the results
only slightly. On the other hand, for RIPPER,
adding more data causes a decrease in performance,
and as we mentioned earlier, even an impossibility
of building a classifier.

3.3 Error Analysis
If errors don?t come from the lack of training data,
then where do they come from? To answer this ques-
tion we performed an error analysis. For each in-
stance (tectogrammatical node), we considered its
context as being the set of values for the features pre-
sented in Appendix A. Table 5 displays in the second
column the number of all contexts. The last three
columns divide the contexts in three groups:
1. Only t ? all instances having these contexts are
assigned t;
2. Only f ? all instances having these contexts
are assigned f;
3. Ambiguous ? some instances that have these
contexts are assigned t and some other are as-
signed f.
The last row of the table shows the number of in-
stances for each type of context, in the training data.
All Only t Only f Ambiguous
#contexts 27,901 9,901 13,009 4,991
#instances 494,759100%

19.01%
42,048
8.49%
358,655
72.49%
Table 5: Contexts & Instances in the training set.
Table 5 shows that the source of ambiguity (and
therefore of errors) stays in 4,991 contexts that cor-
respond to nodes that have been assigned both t and
f. Moreover these contexts yield the largest amount
of instances (72.49%). We investigated further these
ambiguous contexts and we counted how many of
them correspond to a set of nodes that are mostly as-
signed t (#t > #f), respectively f (#t < #f), and how
many are highly ambiguous (half of the correspond-
ing instances are assigned t and the other half f (#t =
#f)). The numbers, shown in Table 6, suggest that in
the training data there are 41,851 instances (8.45%)
(the sum of highlighted numbers in the third row of
the Table 6) that are exceptions, meaning they have
contexts that usually correspond to instances that are
assigned the other TFA value. There are two ex-
planations for these exceptions: either they are part
of the annotators disagreement, or they have some
characteristics that our set of features fail to capture.

Table 6: Ambiguous contexts in the training data.
The error analysis led us to the idea of implementing
a na??ve predictor. This predictor trains on the train-
ing set, and divides the contexts into five groups. Ta-
ble 7 describes these five types of contexts and dis-
plays the TFA value assigned by the na??ve predictor
for each type.
If an instance has a context of type #t = #f, we
decide to assign f because this is the most common
value. Also, for the same reason, new contexts in
the test set that don?t appear in the training set are
assigned f.
The performance of the na??ve predictor on the
evaluation set is 89.88% (correctly classified in-
stances), a value which is significantly higher than

Context Type In the training set, instances with
a context of this type are:

the one obtained by the MaxEnt and RIPPER clas-
sifiers (?? = 30.7, p < 0.001 and respectively ??
= 73.3, p < 0.001), and comparable with the C4.5
value, although the C4.5 classifier still performs sig-
nificantly better (?? = 26.3, p < 0.001).
To find out whether the na??ve predictor would im-
prove if we added more data, we computed the learn-
ing curve, shown in Figure 3. Although the curve
is slightly more abrupt than the ones of the other
classifiers, we do not have enough evidence to be-
lieve that more data in the training set would bring
a significant improvement. We calculated the num-
ber of new contexts in the development set, and al-
though the number is high (2,043 contexts), they
correspond to only 2,125 instances. This suggests
that the new contexts that may appear are very rare,
therefore they cannot yield a big improvement.
4 Conclusions
In this paper we investigated the problem of learn-
ing Information Structure from annotated data. The
contribution of this research is to show for the first
time that IS can be successfuly recovered using
mostly syntactic features. We used the Prague De-
pendency Treebank which is annotated with Infor-
mation Structure following the Praguian theory of
Topic Focus Articulation. The results show that we
can reliably identify t(opic) and f(ocus) with over
90% accuracy while the baseline is at 62%.
Issues for further research include, on the one
hand, a deeper investigation of the Topic-Focus Ar-
ticulation in the Prague Dependency Treebank of
Czech, by improving the feature set, considering
also the distinction between contrastive and non-
contrastive t items and, most importantly, by inves-
tigating how we can use the t/f annotation in PDT
(and respectively our results) in order to detect the
Topic/Focus partitioning of the whole sentence.
We also want to benefit from our experience with
the Czech data in order to create an English corpus
annotated with Information Structure. We have al-
ready started to exploit a parallel English-Czech cor-
pus, in order to transfer to the English version the
topic/focus labels identified by our systems.
