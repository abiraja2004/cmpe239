Abstract
We propose a method to automatically alignWordNet synsets andWikipedia articles to obtain a sense
inventory of higher coverage and quality. For eachWordNet synset, we first extract a set of Wikipedia
articles as alignment candidates; in a second step, we determine which article (if any) is a valid
alignment, i.e. is about the same sense or concept. In this paper, we go significantly beyond state-
of-the-art word overlap approaches, and apply a threshold-based Personalized PageRank method for
the disambiguation step. We show that WordNet synsets can be aligned to Wikipedia articles with a
performance of up to 0.78 F1-Measure based on a comprehensive, well-balanced reference dataset
consisting of 1,815 manually annotated sense alignment candidates. The fully-aligned resource as
well as the reference dataset is publicly available.1
1 Introduction
Lexical semantic resources often used as sense inventories are a prerequisite in automatic processing of
human language. In the last few years, there has been a rise in research aligning different resources to
overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems pertinent to any single resource.
In this paper, we address the task of aligning WordNet noun synsets and Wikipedia articles to obtain a
sense inventory of higher coverage and quality. WordNet, a lexical database for English, is extensively
used in the NLP community and is a de-facto standard resource in many NLP tasks, especially in current
WSD research (Fellbaum, 1998). WordNet?s manually defined comprehensive taxonomymotivates many
researchers to utilize it. However, as WordNet is maintained by only a small group of experts, it is hard to
cope with neologisms, named entities, or rare usages on a large scale (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006; Meyer
and Gurevych, 2010). In order to compensate for WordNet?s lack of coverage, Wikipedia has turned
out to be a valuable resource in the NLP community. Wikipedia has the advantage of being constantly
updated by thousands of voluntary contributors. It is multilingual and freely available containing a
tremendous amount of encyclopedic knowledge enriched with hyperlink information.
In the past, researchers have explored the alignment of Wikipedia categories and WordNet synsets (e.g.,
Toral et al (2008); Ponzetto and Navigli (2009)). However, using the categories instead of the articles
causes three limitations: First, the number of Wikipedia categories (about 0.5 million in the English
edition) is much smaller compared to the number of articles (about 3.35 million). Secondly, the category
system inWikipedia is not structured consistently (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009). And finally, disregarding
the article level neglects the huge amount of textual content provided by the articles.
Therefore, attempts to align WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles (instead of categories) have been
recently made. This has three major benefits. First of all, as WordNet and Wikipedia were found to
be partly complementary on the word sense level, an aligned resource would increase the coverage of
1http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/sense-alignment
205
senses (Wolf and Gurevych, 2010). Second, word senses contained in both resources can then be rep-
resented by relational information from WordNet and encyclopedic information from Wikipedia in a
multilingual manner yielding an enriched knowledge representation. And finally, the third major benefit
of the alignment is the ability to automatically acquire sense-tagged corpora in a mono- and multilin-
gual fashion. For each WordNet synset, the text of the aligned Wikipedia article (or all sentences or
paragraphs in Wikipedia that contain a link to the article) can be automatically extracted similar to the
approach proposed by Mihalcea (2007). Automatically generated sense-tagged corpora can be used to,
e.g., counter the bottleneck of supervised WSD methods that rely on such sense-tagged text collections,
which are rare. Further, due to the cross-lingual links in Wikipedia, also corpora in different languages
can be constructed easily.
Our contribution to this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a novel two-step approach to align WordNet
synsets and Wikipedia articles. We model the task as a word sense disambiguation problem applying
the Personalized PageRank algorithm proposed by Agirre and Soroa (2009) as it is state-of-the-art in
WSD and combine it with a word overlap measure, which increases the overall performance. Second,
we generate and introduce a well-balanced reference dataset for evaluation consisting of 1,815 manually
annotated sense alignment candidates. WordNet synsets and their corresponding Wikipedia article can-
didates are sampled along their distinctive properties such as synset size, domain, or the location in the
WordNet taxonomy. An evaluation on this dataset let us generalize the performance to a full alignment
between WordNet and Wikipedia, which is publicly available for further research activities.
2 Related work
The alignment of WordNet and Wikipedia has been an active area of research for several years with the
goal of creating an enriched ontology. One of the first attempts proposed a new resource YAGO inte-
grating WordNet and Wikipedia consisting of more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts (Suchanek
et al, 2007). The set of entities contains all WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles with titles that are
not represented as terms in WordNet. Thus, they ignore ambiguous entities, e.g., the British rock band
Queen is not covered as the term queen is already contained in WordNet.
Other approaches automatically align WordNet with the categories of Wikipedia instead of the articles.
Toral et al (2008) enrich WordNet with named entities mined from Wikipedia. Therefore, the noun
is-a hierarchy of WordNet is mapped to the Wikipedia categories determining the overlap of articles
belonging to the category and the instances for each of the senses of a polysemous word in WordNet.
Ponzetto and Navigli (2009) applied a knowledge-rich method which maximizes the structural over-
lap between the WordNet taxonomy and the category graph extracted from Wikipedia. Based on the
mapping information, the taxonomy automatically generated from the Wikipedia category graph is re-
structured to enhance the quality. Toral et al (2009) disambiguate WordNet noun synsets and Wikipedia
categories using multiple text similarity measures similar to our approach. A Wikipedia category is
thereby represented by its main article or an article, which has the same title string as the category. Wu
and Weld (2008) integrate the Wikipedia?s infobox information with WordNet to build a rich ontology
using statistical-relational learning.
Ruiz-Casado et al (2005) proposed a method to align WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles (instead
of categories). They align articles of the Simple English Wikipedia to their most similar WordNet synsets
depending on the vector-based similarity of the synset?s gloss and the article text. Recently, Ponzetto and
Navigli (2010) presented a method based on a conditional probability p(s|w) of selecting the WordNet
sense s given the Wikipedia article w, whereas the conditional probability relies on a normalized word
overlap measure of the textual sense representation. Both approaches, however, have the following
two major drawbacks: first, the algorithms are modeled such that they always assume a counterpart in
WordNet for a given Wikipedia article, which does not hold for the English Wikipedia (see Section 4).
Second, the algorithms always assign the most likely WordNet synset to a Wikipedia article, not allowing
multiple alignments. However, due to the different sense granularities in WordNet and Wikipedia, some
Wikipedia articles might be assigned to more than one WordNet synset. Based on these observations,
206
there is a need for a better approach yielding none, one, or more than one alignment for a given synset or
article. We will describe a novel idea to tackle this in the next section.
3 Methodology
Automatic sense alignment aims to match senses of different resources that have the same meaning.2 In
general, one sense is given and the task is to find a correspondent within another resource, in case one ex-
ists. Thereby, automatic sense alignment meets two subgoals. At first, all potential alignment candidate
senses for a given sense have to be extracted. Secondly, these extracted candidates have to be scored to
select the sense(s) that match in meaning. For example, given theWordNet synsetwn =<schooner: sail-
ing vessel used in former times> and the two Wikipedia alignment candidate articles wp1 =<Schooner:
A schooner is a type of sailing vessel ...> and wp2 =<Schooner (glass): A schooner is a type of glass
used for ...>; the article wp1 should be aligned with the synset wn, while the second should not be
aligned. The recall of the extraction step can highly influence the performance of the whole alignment
process. If a sense is not extracted in the first step, it cannot be selected in the alignment step either.
In Section 3.1, we state how we extract Wikipedia alignment candidate articles for a given synset. In the
subsequent Section 3.2, we describe how we determine the article that is aligned to the synset (if any at
all). As almost all Wikipedia articles refer to nouns, we focus on this part-of-speech.
3.1 Candidate extraction
In order to extract Wikipedia articles for a given WordNet synset, we follow the procedure introduced by
Wolf and Gurevych (2010). We shortly summarize this method here: Let wn be a WordNet synset with
a set of synonyms {s1, ? ? ? , sn} of size n. For each synonym s ? wn, we extract all Wikipedia articles
wp ? WPwn that match one of the following constraints:
a) the article title matches s, e.g., the article Window is retrieved for the synonym term Window,
b) the article title is of the form s (description tag), e.g., Window (computing),
c) the article has a redirect that matches s or is of the form s (description tag), e.g., Chaff (counter-
measure) has a redirect Window (codename) and, thus, is retrieved for the synonym term Window,
d) the article is linked in a hyperlink, in which the link anchor text matches s, e.g., the article
Bandwagon effect is retrieved for the term bandwagon, as there exist a hyperlink of the form
[[Bandwagon effect|bandwagon]]. Only hyperlinks that occur in at least 3 different articles are
taken into account in order to reduce noise.
3.2 Candidate alignment
Given the set ofWikipedia candidatesWPwn extracted for synsetwn, we have to classify eachWikipedia
article wp ? WPwn as being a valid alignment or not with respect to wn. Therefore, we first calculate
similarities between synset?article pairs of a given training set. In a second step, we learn a threshold
corresponding to the minimum similarity a sense pair should have to be aligned. This threshold is then
used to fully align WordNet and Wikipedia.
Sense similarity. The basis of our new approach for sense alignment is the PageRank algorithm (Brin
and Page, 1998) relying on a lexical-semantic knowledge base, which is modeled as a graph G =
(V,E). As knowledge base we use WordNet 3.0 extended with manually disambiguated glosses from
the ?Princeton Annotated Gloss Corpus?3. The vertices v ? V represent the synsets; the edges (undi-
rected and unweighted) represent semantic relations between synsets, such as hyponym and hypernym
relations.
2We do not differentiate between the terms sense and concept in this paper as they both refer to the same ?artifact? and
only differ in representation. Concepts in WordNet are described by the entire synset, e.g. the synset <design, plan>. Senses,
however, are words tagged with a sense number, e.g. design N #2, which means the word check as a noun in its second sense.

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the basic ppr (left) and direct pprd (right) approach.
The PageRank algorithm ranks the vertices in a graph according to their importance within the set. Let
M be a (n ? n) transition probability matrix, where Mji = 1outdegreei , if there exist a link from vertex i
to vertex j. Then, the PageRank vector pr over the graph G is equivalent to resolve:
pr = cMpr+ (1? c)v , (1)
whereas c is a damping factor between 0 and 1, and v is an n-dimensional vector whose elements are 1n .
An element of the PageRank vector denotes the probability for the corresponding vertex that a jumper,
randomly following the edges in the graph, ends at that vertex, i.e. the importance of that vertex.
Now, vector v can be personalized by assigning stronger initial probabilities to certain vertices in the
graph. This personalized version of the PageRank algorithm (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) is used in our
approach in two different ways (see Figure 1):
In the basic version ppr , we represent both, Wikipedia articles and WordNet synsets as bag-of-words
(abbreviated as b in the following). The textual representation is tokenized and lemmatized using the
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994); standard stopword removal is applied. For a given synset?article pair, we
calculate two Personalized PageRank vectors. For each Personalized PageRank vector, we initialize
vector v depending on the terms occurring in b:
vi =
{
1
m if a synonymous word of synseti in WordNet occurs in b
0 else ,
(2)
wherem is the number of synsets with a synonymous word occurring in b. For example, given the Word-
Net synset <payment, defrayal, defrayment: the act of paying money> with its bag-of-words (payment,
defrayal, defrayment, act, paying, money), we assign each synset, i.e. vertex in the graph, a weight, for
which at least one of its synonymous words occurs in the bag-of-words. Then, the PageRank vector is a
semantic representation over all WordNet synsets for the given bag-of-words.
In the direct version ppr d, the WordNet synset is directly represented in v by assigning a weight of 1
to the corresponding vector element. It induces that the WordNet synset is already disambiguated and
thus, motivates the use of the Personalized PageRank algorithm on the WordNet graph. Only for the
Wikipedia article, the vector v is built up according to Eq. 2.
Given two Personalized PageRank vectors pprwn and pprwp for the WordNet synset wn and the
Wikipedia article wp, we calculate their similarity using the ?2 measure.4
simppr(wn,wp) = 1? ?2(pprwn, pprwp) = 1?

Learning classifier. Based on the similarity, the sense pair has to be classified as alignment (class 1)
or non-alignment (class 0) formally defined as:
c(wn,wp) =
{
1 if sim(wn,wp) > t
0 else ,
(4)
where sim(wn,wp) is the similarity of a WordNet synset and a Wikipedia article, and t is a real valued
threshold. We apply 10-fold cross-validation to determine the threshold. We measure the performance of
classification by means of F1-Measure (see Section 5) and iteratively search (from 0 to 1 in 0.001 steps)
for a threshold that maximizes the performance on the training fold. A threshold-based classification
scheme induces that a WordNet synset can be aligned to none, one, or more than one Wikipedia article,
which is the main potential of our approach compared to existing methods. However, in the scope of this
paper, we assign at most one Wikipedia article (if any) to a WordNet synset (the one with the highest
similarity above the threshold) as this yields the best performance (see Section 5).
Word overlap measure. For comparison, we also applied the standard cosine word overlap similarity
measure cos used in existing sense alignment approaches (e.g., Ruiz-Casado et al (2005)). We deter-
mine the similarity of the bag-of-words vectors of the WordNet synset and Wikipedia article calculating
the cosine between them. According to Eq. 4 we also learn a classifier based on the cosine similarity.
Combination of the classifiers? output. Finally, we experiment with a heuristic, classifying only those
synset?article pairs as alignment, for which the Personalized PageRank-based classifier and the cosine-
based classifier, i.e. cppr and ccos, or cpprd and ccos, return an alignment to further increase the precision.
Baselines. We implemented two different baselines. The baseline rand randomly selects a Wikipedia
article from the extracted candidate set for each synset. The baseline mfs (most frequent sense) assigns
always the most frequently linked Wikipedia article of the candidate set defined as the article with the
highest number of incoming links. For example, for the synset wn =<tree: a tall perennial woody plant
having a main trunk [...]> suppose we extract the two Wikipedia articles, namely wp1 =<Tree: A tree
is a perennial woody plant.> and wp2 =<Tree (data structure)>. In this case, the sense wp1 is aligned
to the synset wn as it has 4,339 inlinks, about 4,000 more than the article wp2. Both, the rand and mfs
baseline always return a one-to-one alignment.
4 Well-balanced reference dataset
Publicly available evaluation datasets as provided by Fernando and Stevenson (2010) and Wolf and
Gurevych (2010), are either quite small or follow a different annotation scheme. Others consist of ran-
domly sampled synsets, which do not properly represent the distribution of synsets in WordNet following
specific properties. For example, the dataset used in (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) consists of only 2 sense
pairs, whose lemmas are monosemous in WordNet and Wikipedia (e.g. the lemma specifier corresponds
to one synset in WordNet and one article in Wikipedia). As this property holds for one-third of all Word-
Net noun synsets, it is crucial for the choice of the alignment method and thus, should be represented in
the evaluation dataset adequately. Therefore, our goal in this paper is to compile a well-balanced dataset
to cover different domains and properties.
Synsets can be characterized with respect to their so-called assigned Unique Beginner, their synset size,
and their location within the WordNet taxonomy. The Unique Beginners group synsets in semantically
related fields (Fellbaum, 1998) such as entity (subsuming animals, persons, plants, artifacts, body and
food related synsets), abstraction, psychological features, shapes, states, and locations. The synset size
refers to the number of synonymous word senses in the synset. A synset can further be characterized
by its location within the WordNet taxonomy defined as the shortest path between the given synset and
the synset entity, which is the root element of all noun synsets. In addition, we distinguish between

synsets for which more than one Wikipedia candidate article is returned. In summary, for example, the
synset <article, clause: a separate section of a legal document> has a synset size of 2, is assigned to the
Unique Beginner communication, has a shortest path to the root element of length 6, and has 5 extracted
Wikipedia candidate articles.
Based on these distinctive properties, we sampled 320 noun synsets yielding 1,815 sense pairs to be
annotated, i.e. 5.7 Wikipedia articles per synset on average. The exact proportion of synsets with respect
to their properties is detailed in Table 1 in the first four columns.
The manual sense alignment is performed by three human annotators. The annotators were provided
sense alignment candidate pairs, each consisting of a WordNet synset and a Wikipedia article. The anno-
tation task was to label each sense pair either as alignment or not. Table 2 outlines the class distribution
for three annotators and the majority decision.
The most sense alignment candidates were annotated as non-alignments; only between 210 and 244
sense pairs were considered as alignments (extracted for 320 WordNet synsets). To assess the reliability
of the annotators? decision, we computed the pairwise observed inter-annotator agreement AO and the
chance-corrected agreement ? (Artstein and Poesio, 2008)5. The agreement values are shown in Table 3.
The average observed agreement AO is 0.9721, while the multi-? is 0.8727 indicating high reliability.
The final dataset was compiled by means of a majority decision. Given 1,815 sense alignment candidate
pairs, 1,588 were annotated as non-alignments, while 227 were annotated as alignments. 215 synsets
were aligned with one article, while 6 synsets were aligned with two articles. Interesting to note is that the
aligned samples are uniformly distributed among the different sampling dimensions as shown in Table 1
(right column). It demonstrates that WordNet synsets of different properties are contained in Wikipedia.
On the other side, 99 synsets, i.e. approx. 1/3 of the sampled synsets, could not be aligned. Most of
them are not contained in Wikipedia at all, e.g. the synset <dream (someone or something wonderful)>
or <outside, exterior (the region that is outside of something)>. Others are not explicitly encoded on
the article level such as the synset <quatercentennial, quatercentenary (the 400th anniversary (or the
celebration of it))>, which is part of the more general Wikipedia article <Anniversary>.
5 Experiments
In our experiments, we represent a WordNet synset either by itself (in the direct version pprd ) or by
its set of synonymous word senses and its gloss and examples (in the basic version ppr ). Optionally,
we include hyponym and hypernym synsets to extend the sense representation of a synset: (SYN): the
5Note: ?As the class distribution is highly skewed, the test for reliability in such cases is the ability to agree on the rare
categories [. . . ]? (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). This, in fact, is the category/class, in which we are most interested in.

A Wikipedia article is represented by either its first paragraph6 as it usually contains a compact descrip-
tion of the article or its whole article text. The article title and additional assigned information such as
categories or redirects can also be taken into account: (P): first paragraph of Wikipedia article (with a
minimum length of 200 characters7); (TXT): the whole article text; (T): article title; (C): all categories
assigned to the article; (R): all redirects assigned to the article.
Table 4 lists the performance of our approach for different experimental settings.8 We evaluate our
approach in terms of F1-Measure (F1 = 2?P?RP+R ), where P is the precision andR the recall. The precision
P determines the ratio of correct alignments to all alignments assigned by the algorithm. The recall R
identifies the number of correct alignments to the total number of correct alignments in the gold standard.
Further, we provide an accuracy measure Acc, which denotes the percentage of the correctly identified
alignments and non-alignments.
Similarity measure. Overall, the Personalized PageRank approach outperforms the cosine similar-
ity. cos achieves an F1-Measure of 0.738, while pprd reaches 0.754 and ppr even 0.776, which is a
performance gain of 2.1% and 5.1%, respectively. This, in fact, strengthens our motivation to employ se-
mantic relatedness based approaches instead of a simple word overlap approach. For example, the synset
<Johannesburg> and its corresponding Wikipedia article is not aligned based on the cosine approach as
only three terms overlap. However, the ppr and pprd approach classify the synset?article pair as align-
ment as there exists semantic relatedness between ?large economy? and ?commercial center? occurring
in the textual sense representations.
The performance differences between pprd and ppr correlate with the synset representation. On the one
hand, utilizing the SYN representation, pprd outperforms the ppr approach. This shows the effect of
disambiguating the WordNet synset beforehand. On the other hand, when presenting the synset together
with its hypernym or both, hypernyms and hyponyms, ppr yields the best performance. This might
be due to the fact that a Wikipedia article often contains more general terms, i.e. hypernym concepts,
especially within the first paragraph of a Wikipedia article.
All combinations yield higher performance compared to the stand-alone classifiers. For example, for
the setting SYN+HYPER and P+T+C, cos yields 0.738, ppr 0.765, and the combination of both 0.781

article text, yield higher performance, we report only these numbers here.

performance, which is an improvement of 5.8% and 2.1% compared to the cos and ppr approach,
respectively. The performance gain originates from higher precision.
Sense representation. All similarity measures yield better performance representing the WordNet
synset together with their hypernym synsets regardless of the representation of the Wikipedia article.
As stated before, this might be due to the fact that Wikipedia articles often contain hypernym concepts
in their textual representation. Further, each synset has exactly one direct hypernym concept, while the
number of hyponym concepts is not limited. This can cause a very noisy description of a synset, not
focusing on the textual representation of the actual sense. When representing the Wikipedia sense, the
categories always boost the performance, while redirects are not helpful and can yield even a performance
drop. The reason might be that redirects contain much noisy information, e.g. spelling variations.
Baselines. The rand and the mfs baselines achieve an F1-Measure of 0.527 and 0.534, respectively.
They always assign a sense even only 221 of 320 synsets can be aligned to Wikipedia. If we only
consider the 221 synsets for which an alignment exist, the mfs baseline achieves an F1-Measure of 0.76,
i.e. for 146 out of 221 synsets the aligned Wikipedia article is the most frequent sense as we defined it in
Section 3.2.
Upper bound. The human annotators show a pairwise agreement ? between 0.866 and 0.878, which
serves as an upper bound for this task. For each measure and its best performing experimental setting as
listed in Table 4, we calculate the agreement with the annotators? alignments (see Table 5). The combined
approach ppr + cos achieves the highest agreement values ?, between 0.728 and 0.740. These values
show that the automatic annotation is fairly reliable.
5.1 Error analysis
We manually analyzed the alignments generated by the best performing experimental setup (ppr + cos,
SYN+HYPER, P+T+C). For synsets corresponding to more than one extracted Wikipedia candidate, the
average number of Wikipedia candidates is around 10, which, indeed, makes the alignment step very
challenging for some synsets. For example, for the synset <mission, military mission (an operation
that is assigned by a higher headquarters)> 30 Wikipedia candidates were extracted in total, whereas
only the article with the title <Military operation> was aligned manually. 10 out of the 30 are articles
about space flight missions and Christian missionary. Most of the remaining 19 refer to city names, song
titles, and other named entities. Our approach returns the highest similarity for the article <Military
operation>, which demonstrates that the alignment works well in this example.
As listed in Table 6, the best performing experimental setup correctly aligned 178 of the 227 manual
alignments. The remaining 49 manual alignments were not assigned. Instead, 51 additional sense can-
212
didate pairs were incorrectly considered as alignment. It is noticeable that the errors are almost equally
distributed among the distinctive properties a synset can have as defined in Section 4. We could not
observe that a specific synset property causes the majority of errors.
Most of the 51 false positives are due to highly related sense alignment candidates, e.g. (cottonseed, cot-
tonseed oil), (electroretinogram, electroretrinography), or (insulin shock, insulin shock therapy). These
sense alignment candidates have either the same stem but different suffixes or one part is a holonym or
meronym of the other part. This knowledge can be used to apply additional post-processing steps to
boost the performance. Further, even if they are non-aligned manually as they do not describe the same
sense, the concepts are highly related, and thus, the alignment might be useful in specific tasks.
Most of the 49 manual alignments that could not be aligned automatically are due to the differences how
senses are defined in WordNet and Wikipedia. For example, the WordNet synset <payment, defrayal,
defrayment: the act of paying money> and the manually alignedWikipedia article<Payment: A payment
is the transfer of wealth from one party (such as person or company) to another ...> could not be aligned
automatically. In this example, the textual similarity or relatedness is not sufficient to classify them as a
valid alignment. This fact shows that other types of knowledge should be additionally integrated in the
alignment approach, such as structural or taxonomic knowledge.
6 Conclusions
We have presented a novel two-step approach to automatically align English Wikipedia articles and
WordNet synsets. We have shown that a threshold-based method models the task properly yielding
none, one, or more than one alignment of a Wikipedia article for a given WordNet synset. This is dif-
ferent to previous sense alignment approaches. Further, we have shown that it is important to employ
semantic relatedness measuring the similarity of textual sense representations. Our approach to the auto-
matic alignment shows an encouraging performance of 0.78 F1-Measure and 94.5% accuracy based on a
comprehensive, well-balanced reference dataset consisting of 1,815 manually annotated sense alignment
candidates.
We have created a fully-aligned resource with our best performing setting (ppr + cos , SYN+HYPER,
P+T+C, threshold: 0.439 for ppr , 0.048 for cos ), in which two-thirds of all WordNet noun synsets are
aligned with one article from the English Wikipedia. On the one hand, this fact supports our assumption
and overall motivation that both resources are partly complementary at the sense level (one-third of all
noun synsets are not in Wikipedia). On the other hand, for the two-thirds of WordNet noun synsets, the
alignment yields relational information from WordNet and encyclopedic information from Wikipedia.
We believe that this new resource and the enhanced knowledge therein can boost the performance of
various NLP systems that previously had to rely on a single resource only. We already started research
on integrating the aligned resource in WSD and semantic relatedness tasks. The fully-aligned resource
as well as the reference dataset are publicly available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/
data/sense-alignment for further research activities.
