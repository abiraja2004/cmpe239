Abstract 
This demonstration will illustrate an inter-
active immersive computer game, POMY, 
designed to help Korean speakers learn 
English. This system allows learners to ex-
ercise their visual and aural senses, receiv-
ing a full immersion experience to increase 
their memory and concentration abilities to 
a greatest extent. In POMY, learners can 
have free conversations with game charac-
ters and receive corrective feedback to their 
errors. Game characters show various emo-
tional expressions based on learners? input 
to keep learners motivated. Through this 
system, learners can repeatedly practice 
conversations in everyday life setting in a 
foreign language with no embarrassment. 
1 Introduction 
The needs for computer-based methods for learn-
ing language skills and components are increasing. 
One of the ultimate goals of computer-assisted 
language learning is to provide learners with an 
immersive environment that facilitates acquiring 
communicative competence. According to Second 
Language Acquisition (SLA) theories, there are 
some essential factors for improving learners? con-
versational skills: 1) comprehensible inputs and 
outputs, 2) corrective feedback, and 3) motivation 
and attitude. SLA theories imply that providing 
learners with the opportunity to have free conver-
sations with someone who can correct their errors 
is very important for successful acquisition of for-
eign languages. Moreover, motivation is another 
crucial factor; therefore a good CALL system 
should have elements which can interest learners 
[1]. 
Considering these requirements, we have devel-
oped a conversational English education frame-
work, POMY (POstech iMmersive English studY). 
The program allows users to exercise their visual 
and aural senses to receive a full immersion expe-
rience to develop into independent English as a 
Foreign Language (EFL) learners and increase 
their memory and concentration abilities to a 
greatest extent [2].

2 Demonstrated System 
In order to provide learners with immersive world, 
we have developed a virtual reality environment 
using the Unity 3D game engine1. For the domains 
that learners are exposed to, we select such do-
mains as path-finding, market, post office, library, 
and movie theater (Figure 1) to ensure having 
learners practice conversations in everyday life 
setting. To keep learners motivated and interested 
during learning sessions, learners are encouraged 
to accomplish several missions. For example, the 
first mission in the post office is to send a camera 
to one?s uncle in England. The package must be 
insured and delivered by the next week. In order to 
send the package, a learner must talk to Non-
Player Characters (NPCs) to fill in the zip-code 
properly.  
All NPCs can perceive the utterances of learners, 
especially Korean learners of English. Korean 
learners? production of the sound is different from 
those of native speakers, resulting in numerous 
pronunciation errors. Therefore, we have collected 
a Korean-English corpus to train acoustic models. 
In addition, since language learners commit nu-
merous grammatical errors, we should consider 
this to understand their utterances. Thus, we statis-
tically infer the actual learners' intention by taking 
not only the utterance itself but also the dialog con-
text into consideration, as human tutors do [1]. 
While free conversation is invaluable to the 
acquisition process, it is not sufficient for learners 
to fully develop their L2 proficiency. Corrective 
feedback to learners? grammatical errors is 
necessary for improving accuracy in their 
interlanguage. For this purpose, we designed a

special character, Ghost Tutor, which plays the 
role of English tutor and helps learners to use more 
appropriate words and expressions during the game. 
When a learner produces ungrammatical utterances, 
the Ghost Tutor provides both implicit and explicit 
negative and positive feedback in a form of 
elicitation or recast, which was manifested as 
effective ways in the second language acquisition 
processes [3].  To provide corrective feedback on 
grammatical errors, we use a method which con-
sists of two sub-models: the grammaticality check-
ing model and the error type classification model 
[4]. Firstly, we automatically generate grammatical 
errors that learners usually commit [5-6], and con-
struct error patterns based on the articulated errors. 
Then the grammaticality checking model classifies 
the recognized user speech based on the similarity 
between the error patterns and the recognition re-
sult using confidence scores. After that, the error 
type classification model chooses the error type 
based on the most similar error pattern and the er-
ror frequency extracted from a learner corpus. 
Finally, the human perception of NPC?s emo-
tional expressions plays a crucial role in human 
computer interaction. Thus, all NPCs are provided 
with a number of communicative animations such 
as talking, laughing, waving, crying, thinking, and 
getting angry (Figure 2).The total number of ani-
mations is over thirty from which the system can  
select one based on the response of a learner. The 
system generates positive expressions such as 
clapping and laughing when the learner answers 
correctly, and negative expressions such as crying 
and getting angry for incorrect answers.
