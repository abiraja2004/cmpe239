Abstract
Human language with all its intricacies is per-
haps one of the finest examples of a complex sys-
tem. Therefore, it becomes absolutely necessary
to study the faculty of language from the perspec-
tive of a complex system. Of late, there has been
an upsurge in the use of networks in modeling the
complex dynamics of various natural and artificial
systems. While some of these works aim at us-
ing social network techniques to build certain end-
user applications, others are more fundamental in
the sense that they employ these techniques to ex-
plain the emergent properties of a complex system
as a whole. A substantial amount of research have
also been done in the field of linguistics to employ
social networks in the design of efficient solutions
for numerous problems in NLP and language evolu-
tion. The objective of this tutorial is to show how
language and its dynamics can be successfully stud-
ied in the framework of social networks. The tuto-
rial will particularly demonstrate the relevance of so-
cial network-based methods in the development of a
large variety of NLP applications and in understand-
ing the dynamics of language evolution and change.
The tutorial is divided into two parts. Part I begins
with a brief introduction to this field showing how
linguistic entities and the interactions between them
can be respectively represented through the nodes
and edges of a network. This will be followed by a
comprehensive survey of the general theory of social
networks with a special emphasis on the methods of
analysis and models of synthesis for such networks.
Part II presents three case studies. The first case
study is on unsupervised POS tagging, the second
one involves modeling of the mental lexicon and ap-
plications of such models in spell checking and word
sense disambiguation. The third case study demon-
strates the usefulness of social networks in explain-
ing some of the evolutionary dynamics of language
pertaining to the sound inventories.
The tutorial is concluded by (a) comparing the
above methods with more traditional methods of do-
ing NLP, (b) providing pointers as to where to look
for/publish materials in this area, and, (c) indicating
some of the future research directions.
