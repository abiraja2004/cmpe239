Abstract 
Due to its complexity, meeting speech pro-
vides a challenge for both transcription and 
annotation. While Amazon?s Mechanical Turk 
(MTurk) has been shown to produce good re-
sults for some types of speech, its suitability 
for transcription and annotation of spontane-
ous speech has not been established. We find 
that MTurk can be used to produce high-
quality transcription and describe two tech-
niques for doing so (voting and corrective). 
We also show that using a similar approach, 
high quality annotations useful for summari-
zation systems can also be produced. In both 
cases, accuracy is comparable to that obtained 
using trained personnel.  
1 Introduction 
Recently, Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has 
been shown to produce useful transcriptions of 
speech data; Gruenstein et al (2009) have success-
fully used MTurk to correct the transcription out-
put from a speech recognizer, while Novotney and 
Callison-Burch (2010) used MTurk for transcrib-
ing a corpus of conversational speech. These stu-
dies suggest that transcription, formerly considered 
to be an exacting task requiring at least some train-
ing, could be carried out by casual workers. How-
ever, only fairly simple transcription tasks were 
studied.  
 We propose to assess the suitability of MTurk 
for processing more challenging material, specifi-
cally recordings of meeting speech. Spontaneous 
speech can be difficult to transcribe because it may 
contain false starts, disfluencies, mispronunciations 
and other defects. Similarly for annotation, meet-
ing content may be difficult to follow and conven-
tions difficult to apply consistently.  
 Our first goal is to ascertain whether MTurk 
transcribers can accurately transcribe spontaneous 
speech, containing speech errors and of variable 
utterance length.  
 Our second goal is to use MTurk for creating 
annotations suitable for extractive summarization 
research, specifically labeling each utterance as 
either ?in-summary? or ?not in-summary?. Among 
other challenges, this task cannot be decomposed 
into small independent sub-tasks?for example, 
annotators cannot be asked to annotate a single 
utterance independent of other utterances. To our 
knowledge, MTurk has not been previously ex-
plored for the purpose of summarization annota-
tion.  
2 Meeting Speech Transcription Task 
We recently explored the use of MTurk for tran-
scription of short-duration clean speech (Marge et 
al., 2010) and found that combining independent 
transcripts using ROVER yields very close agree-
ment with a gold standard (2.14%, comparable to 
expert agreement). But simply collecting indepen-
dent transcriptions seemed inefficient: the ?easy? 
parts of each utterance are all transcribed the same. 
In the current study our goal is determine whether 
a smaller number of initial transcriptions can be 
used to identify easy- and difficult-to-transcribe 
regions, so that the attention of subsequent tran-
scribers can be focused on the more difficult re-
gions.  
2.1 Procedure 
In this corrective strategy for transcription, we 
have two turkers to independently produce tran-
scripts. A word-level minimum edit distance me-
tric is then used to align the two transcripts and 
locate disagreements. These regions are replaced 
with underscores, and new turkers are asked to 
transcribe those regions.  
Utterances were balanced for transcription dif-
ficulty (measured by the native English back-
99
ground of the speaker and utterance length). For 
the first pass transcription task, four sets of jobs 
were posted for turkers to perform, with each pay-
ing $0.01, $0.02, $0.04, or $0.07 per approved 
transcription. Payment was linearly scaled with the 
length of the utterance to be transcribed at a rate of 
$0.01 per 10 seconds of speech, with an additional 
payment of $0.01 for providing feedback. In each 
job set, there were 12 utterances to be transcribed 
(yielding a total of 24 jobs available given two 
transcribers per utterance). Turkers were free to 
transcribe as many utterances as they could across 
all payment amounts. 
After acquiring two transcriptions, we aligned 
them, identified points of disagreement and re-
posted the transcripts and the audio as part of a 
next round of job sets. Payment amounts were kept 
the same based on utterance length. In this second 
pass of transcriptions, three turkers were recruited 
to correct and amend each transcription. Thus, a 
total of five workers worked on every transcription 
after both iterations of the corrective task. In our 
experiment 23 turkers performed the first phase of 
the task, and 28 turkers the corrective task (4 
workers did both passes).  
2.2 First and Second Pass Instructions 
First-pass instructions asked turkers to listen to 
utterances with an embedded audio player pro-
vided with the HIT. Turkers were instructed to 
transcribe every word heard in the audio and to 
follow guidelines for marking speaker mispronun-
ciations and false starts. Filled pauses (?uh?, ?um?, 
etc.) were not to be transcribed in the first pass. 
Turkers could replay the audio as many times as 
necessary. 
In the second pass, turkers were instructed to 
focus on the portions of the transcript marked with 
underscores, but also to correct any other words 
they thought were incorrect. The instructions also 
asked turkers to identify three types of filler words: 
?uh?, ?um?, and ?lg? (laughter). We selected this 
set since they were the most frequent in the gold 
standard transcripts. Again, turkers could replay 
the audio.  
2.3 Speech Corpus 
The data were sampled from a previously-collected 
corpus of natural meetings (Banerjee and Rud-
nicky, 2007). The material used in this paper 
comes from four speakers, two native English 
speakers and two non-Native English speakers (all 
male). We selected 48 audio clips; 12 from each of 
the four speakers. Within each speaker's set of 
clips, we further divided the material into four 
length categories: ~5, ~10, ~30 and ~60 sec. The 
speech material is conversational in nature; the 
gold standard transcriptions of this data included 
approximately 15 mispronunciations and 125 false 
starts. Table 1 presents word count information 
related to the utterances in each length category.

3 Meeting Transcription Analysis 
Evaluation of first and second pass corrections was 
done by calculating word error rate (WER) with a 
gold standard, obtained using the transcription 
process described in (Bennett and Rudnicky, 
2002). Before doing so, we normalized the candi-
date MTurk transcriptions as follows: spell-
checking (with included domain-specific technical 
terms), and removal of punctuation (periods, com-
mas, etc.). Apostrophes were retained. 
 
Table 2. WER across transcription iterations. 
3.1 First-Pass Transcription Results 
Results from aligning our first-pass transcriptions 
with a gold standard are shown in the second col-
umn of Table 2. Overall error rate was 23.8%, 
which reveals the inadequacy of individual turker 
transcriptions, if no further processing is done. 
(Remember that first-pass transcribers were asked 
to leave out fillers even though the gold standard 
contained them, thus increasing WER).

In this first pass, speech from non-native speak-
ers was transcribed more poorly (25.4% WER) 
than speech from native English speakers (21.7% 
WER). In their comments sections, 17% of turkers 
noted the difficulty in transcribing non-native 
speakers, while 13% found native English speech 
difficult. More than 80% of turkers thought the 
amount of work ?about right? for the payment re-
ceived.  
3.2 Second-Pass Transcription Results 
The corrective process greatly improved agreement 
with our expert transcriptions. Aggregate WER 
was reduced from 23.8% to 17.5% (27% relative 
reduction) when turkers corrected initial transcripts 
with highlighted disagreements (third column of 
Table 2). In fact, transcriptions after corrections 
were significantly more accurate than initial tran-
scriptions (F(1, 238) = 13.4, p < 0.05). With re-
spect to duration, the WER of the 5-second utter-
ances had the greatest improvement, a relative re-
duction of WER by 37%.  Transcription alignment  
with the gold standard experienced a 39% im-
provement to 13.3% for native English speech, and 
a 19% improvement to 20.6% for non-native Eng-
lish speech (columns 2 and 3 of Table 3).  
 We found that 30% of turkers indicated that the 
second-pass correction task was difficult, as com-
pared with 15% for the first-pass transcription task. 
Work amount was perceived to be about right 
(85% of the votes) in this phase, similar to the first. 
3.3 Combining Corrected Transcriptions 
In order to improve the transcriptions further, we 
combined the three second-pass transcriptions of 
each utterance using ROVER?s word-level voting 
scheme (Fiscus, 1997). The WER of the resulting 
transcripts are presented in the fourth column of 
Table 2. Aggregate WER was further reduced by 
14% relative to 15.1%. This result is close to typ-
ical disagreement rates of 6-12% reported in the 
literature (Roy and Roy, 2009). The best im-
provements using ROVER were found with the 
transcriptions of the shorter utterances: WER 
from the second-pass of 5-second utterances tran-
scriptions was reduced by 23% to 15.3%. The 10-
second utterance transcriptions experienced the 
best improvement, 32%, to a WER of 13.8%. 
 Although segmenting audio into shorter seg-
ments may yield fast turnaround times, we found 
that utterance length is not a significant factor in 
determining alignment between combined, cor-
rected transcriptions and gold-standard transcrip-
tions (F(3, 44) = 0.16, p = 0.92). We speculate that 
longer utterances show good accuracy due to the 
increased context available to transcribers.  
Table 3. WER across transcription iterations based on 
speaker background. 
3.4 Error Analysis 
Out of 3,281 words (48 merged transcriptions of 
48 utterances), 496 were errors. Among the errors 
were 37 insertions, 315 deletions, and 144 substitu-
tions. Thus the most common error was to miss a 
word.  
 Further analysis revealed that two common cas-
es of errors occurred: the misplacement or exclu-
sion of filler words (even though the second phase 
explicitly instructed turkers to insert filler words) 
and failure to transcribe words considered to be out 
of the range of the transcriber?s vocabulary, such 
as technical terms and foreign names. Filler words 
accounted for 112 errors (23%). Removing fillers 
from both the combined transcripts and the gold 
standard improved WER by 14% relative to 
13.0%. Further, WER for native English speech 
transcriptions was reduced to 8.9%. This difference 
was however not statistically significant (F(1,94) = 
1.64, p = 0.2). 
 Turkers had difficulty transcribing uncommon 
words, technical terms, names, acronyms, etc. 
(e.g., ?Speechalyzer?, ?CTM?, ?PQs?). Investiga-
tion showed that at least 41 errors (8%) could be 
attributed to this out-of-vocabulary problem. It is 
unclear if there is any way to completely eradicate 
such errors, short of asking the original speakers. 
3.5 Comparison to One-Pass Approach 
Although the corrective model provides significant 
gain from individual transcriptions, this approach 
is logistically more complex. We compared it to 
our one-pass approach, in which five turkers inde-
pendently transcribe all utterances (Marge et al, 
2010). Five new transcribers per utterance were 
recruited for this task (yielding 240 transcriptions).

Native  21.7% 13.3% 10.8% 
Non-native 25.4% 20.6% 18.4% 
101
Individual error rate was 24.0%, comparable to the 
overall error rate for the first step of the corrective 
approach (Table 2).  
 After combining all five transcriptions with 
ROVER, we found similar gains to the corrective 
approach: an overall improvement to 15.2% error 
rate. Thus both approaches can effectively produce 
high-quality transcriptions. We speculate that if 
higher accuracy is required, the corrective process 
could be extended to iteratively re-focus effort on 
the regions of greatest disagreement. 
3.6 Latency 
Although payment scaled with the duration of ut-
terances, we observed a consistent disparity in tur-
naround time. All HITs were posted at the same 
time in both iterations (Thursday afternoon, EST). 
Turkers were able to transcribe 48 utterances twice 
in about a day in the first pass for the shorter utter-
ances (5- and 10-second utterances), while it took 
nearly a week to transcribe the 30- and 60-second 
utterances. Turkers were likely discouraged by the 
long duration of the transcriptions compounded 
with the nature of the speech. To increase turna-
round time on lengthy utterances, we speculate that 
it may be necessary to scale payment non-linearly 
with length (or another measure of perceived ef-
fort). 
3.7 Conclusion 
Spontaneous speech, even in long segments, can 
indeed be transcribed on MTurk with a level of 
accuracy that approaches expert agreement rates 
for spontaneous speech. However, we expect seg-
mentation of audio materials into smaller segments 
would yield fast turnaround time, and may keep 
costs low. In addition, we find that ROVER works 
more effectively on shorter segments because 
lengths of candidate transcriptions are less likely to 
have large disparities. Thus, multiple transcriptions 
per utterance can be utilized best when their 
lengths are shorter.  
4 Annotating for Summarization  
4.1 Motivation 
Transcribing audio data into text is the first step 
towards making information contained in audio 
easily accessible to humans. A next step is to con-
dense the information in the raw transcription, and 
produce a short summary that includes the most 
important information. Good summaries can pro-
vide readers with a general sense of the meeting, or 
help them to drill down into the raw transcript (or 
the audio itself) for additional information. 
4.2 Annotation Challenges  
Unfortunately, summary creation is a difficult task 
because ?importance? is inherently subjective and 
varies from consumer to consumer. For example, 
the manager of a project, browsing a summary of a 
meeting, might be interested in all agenda items, 
whereas a project participant may be interested in 
only those parts of the meeting that pertain to his 
portion of the project.  
Despite this subjectivity, the usefulness of a 
summary is clear, and audio summarization is an 
active area of research. Within this field, two kinds 
of human annotations are generally created?
annotators are either asked to write a short sum-
mary of the audio, or they are asked to label each 
transcribed utterance as either ?in summary? or 
?out of summary?. The latter annotation is particu-
larly useful for training and evaluating extractive 
summarization systems?systems that create sum-
maries by selecting a subset of the utterances.  
Due to the subjectivity involved, we find very 
low inter-annotator agreement for this labeling 
task. Liu and Liu (2008) reported Kappa agreement 
scores of between 0.11 and 0.35 across 6 annota-
tors, Penn and Zhu (2008) reported 0.38 on tele-
phone conversation and 0.37 on lecture speech, 
using 3 annotators, and Galley (2006) reported 
0.32 on meeting data. Such low levels of agree-
ment imply that the resulting training data is likely 
to contain a great deal of ?noise??utterances la-
beled ?in summary? or ?out of summary?, when in 
fact they are not good examples of those classes. 
Disagreements arise due to the fact that utter-
ance importance is a spectrum.  While some utter-
ances are clearly important or unimportant, there 
are many utterances that lie between these ex-
tremes. In order to label utterances as either ?in-
summary? or not, annotators must choose an arbi-
trary threshold at which to make this decision. 
Simply asking annotators to provide a continuous 
?importance value? between 0 and 1 is also likely 
to be infeasible as the exact value for a given utter-
ance is difficult to ascertain. 
102
4.3 3-Class Formulation 
One way to alleviate this problem is to redefine the 
task as a 3-class labeling problem. Annotators can 
be asked to label utterances as either ?important?, 
?unimportant? or ?in-between?. Although this for-
mulation creates two decision boundaries, instead 
of the single one in the 2-class formulation, the 
expectation is that a large number of utterances 
with middling importance will simply be assigned 
to the ?in between? class, thus reducing the amount 
of noise in the data. Indeed we have shown (Baner-
jee and Rudnicky, 2009) that in-house annotators 
achieve high inter-annotator agreement when pro-
vided with the 3-class formulation. 
Another way to alleviate the problem of low 
agreement is to obtain annotations from many an-
notators, and identify the utterances that a majority 
of the annotators appear to agree on; such utter-
ances may be considered as good examples of their 
class. Using multiple annotators is typically not 
feasible due to cost. In this paper we investigate 
using MTurk to create 3-class-based summariza-
tion annotations from multiple annotators per 
meeting, and to combine and filter these annota-
tions to create high quality labels. 
5 Using Mechanical Turk for Annotations 
5.1 Challenges of Using Mechanical Turk 
Unlike some other tasks that require little or no 
context in order to perform the annotation, summa-
rization annotation requires a great deal of context. 
It is unlikely that an annotator can determine the 
importance of an utterance without being aware of 
neighboring utterances. Moreover, the appropriate 
length of context for a given utterance is likely to 
vary. Presenting all contiguous utterances that dis-
cuss the same topic might be appropriate, but 
would require manual segmentation of the meeting 
into topics. In this paper we experiment with show-
ing all utterances of a meeting. This is a challenge 
however, because MTurk is typically applied to 
quick low-cost tasks that need little context. It is 
unclear whether turkers would be willing to per-
form such a time-consuming task, even for higher 
payment. 
Another challenge for turkers is being able to 
understand the discussion well enough to perform 
the annotation. We experiment here with meetings 
that include significant technical content. While in-
house annotators can be trained over time to under-
stand the material well enough to perform the task, 
it is impractical to provide turkers with such train-
ing. We investigate the degree to which turkers can 
provide summarization annotation with minimal 
training.  
5.2 Data Used 
We selected 5 recorded meetings for our study. 
These meetings were not scripted?and would 
have taken place even if they weren?t being rec-
orded. They were project meetings containing dis-
cussions about software deliverables, problems, 
resolution plans, etc. The contents included tech-
nical jargon and concepts that non-experts are un-
likely to grasp by reading the meeting transcript 
alone.  
The 5 meetings had 2 to 4 participants each 
(mean: 3.5). For all meetings, the speech from each 
participant was recorded separately using head-
mounted close-talking microphones. We manually 
split these audio streams into utterances?ensuring 
that utterances did not have more than a 0.5 second 
pause in them, and then transcribed them using an 
established process (Bennett and Rudnicky, 2002). 
The meetings varied widely in length from 15 mi-
nutes and 282 utterances to 40 minutes and 948 
utterances (means: 30 minutes, 610 utterances). 
There were 3,052 utterances across the 5 meetings, 
each containing an mean of 7 words. The utter-
ances in the meetings were annotated using the 3-
class formulation by two in-house annotators. 
Their inter-annotator agreement is presented along 
with the rest of the evaluation results in Section 6.

5.3 HIT Design and Instructions 
We instructed turkers to imagine that someone else 
(not them) was going to eventually write a report 
about the meeting, and it was their task to identify 
those utterances that should be included in the re-
port. We asked annotators to label utterances as 
?important? if they should be included in the report 
and ?unimportant? otherwise. In addition, utter-
ances that they thought were of medium impor-
tance and that may or may not need to be included 
in the report were to be labeled as ?neutral?. We 
provided examples of utterances in each of these 
classes. For the ?important? class, for instance, we 
included ?talking about a problem? and ?discuss-
ing future plan of action? as examples. For the ?un-
important? class, we included ?off topic joking?, 
and for the ?neutral? class ?minute details of an 
algorithm? was an example. 
In addition to these instructions and examples, 
we gave turkers a general guideline to the effect 
that in these meetings typically 1/4th of the utter-
ances are ?important?, 1/4th ?neutral? and the rest 
?unimportant?. As we discuss in section 6, it is 
unclear whether most turkers followed this guide-
line. 
Following these instructions, examples and tips, 
we provided the text of the utterances in the form 
of an HTML table. Each row contained a single 
utterance, prefixed with the name of the speaker. 
The row also contained three radio buttons for the 
three classes into which the annotator was asked to 
classify the utterance. Although we did not ensure 
that annotators annotated every utterance before 
submitting their work, we observed that for 95% of 
the utterances every annotator did provide a judg-
ment; we ignore the remaining 5% of the utter-
ances in our evaluation below. 
5.4 Number of Turkers and Payment 
For each meeting, we used 5 turkers and paid each 
one the same. That is, we did not vary the payment 
amount as an experimental variable. We calculated 
the amount to pay for a meeting based on in the 
length of that meeting. Specifically, we multiplied 
the number of utterances by 0.13 US cents to arrive 
at the payment. This resulted in payments ranging 
from 35 cents to $1.25 per meeting (mean 79 
cents). The effective hourly rate (based on how 
much time turkers took to actually finish each job) 
was $0.87. 
6 Annotation Results 
6.1 Label Distribution 
We first examine the average distribution of labels 
across the 3 classes. Figure 1 shows the distribu-
tions (expressed as percentages of the number of 
utterances) for in-house and MTurk annotators, 
averaged across the 5 meetings. Observe that the 
distribution for the in-house annotators is far more 
skewed away from a uniform 33% assignment, 
whereas the label distribution of turkers is less 
skewed. The likely reason for this difference is that

turkers have a poorer understanding of the meet-
ings, and are more likely than in-house annotators 
to make arbitrary judgments about utterances. This 
poor understanding perhaps also explains the large 
difference in the percentage of utterances labeled 
as important?for many utterances that are difficult 
to understand, turkers probably play it safe by 
marking it important.  
The error bars represent the standard deviations of 
these averages, and capture the difference in label 
distribution from meeting to meeting. While different 
meetings are likely to inherently have different ratios 
of the 3 classes, observe that the standard deviations 
for the in-house annotators are much lower than those 
for the turkers. For example, the percentage of utter-
ances labeled ?important? by in-house annotators 
varies from 9% to 22% across the 5 meetings, whe-
reas it varies from 30% to 57% for turkers, a much 
wider range. These differences in standard deviation 
persist for each meeting as well?that is, for any giv-
en meeting, the label distribution of the turkers varies 
much more between each other than the distribution 
of the in-house annotators. 
6.2 Inter-Annotator Agreement 
Figure 2 shows the kappa values for pairs of anno-
tators, averaged across the 5 meetings, while the 
error bars represent the standard deviations. The 
kappa between the two in-house annotators. (0.4) 
is well within the range of values reported in the 
summarization literature (see section 4). The kappa 
values range from 0.24 to 0.50 across the 5 meet-
ings. The inter-annotator agreement between pairs 
of turkers, averaged across the 10 possible pairs 
per meeting (5 choose 2), and across the 5 meet-
ings show that turkers tend to agree less between 
each other than in-house annotators, although this 
kappa (0.28) is still within the range of typical 
agreement (this kappa has lower variance because 
the sample size is larger). The kappa between in-
house annotators and turkers1 (0.19) is on the low-
er end of the scale but remains within the range of 
agreement reported in the literature, suggesting 
that Mechanical Turk may be a useful tool for 
summarization.

 For each meeting, we measure agreement between every 
possible pair of annotators such that one of the annotators was 
an in-house annotator, and the other a turker. Here we present 
the average agreement across all such pairs, and across all the 
meetings. 
6.3 Agreement after Voting 
We consider merging the annotations from mul-
tiple turkers using a simple voting scheme as fol-
lows. For each utterance, if 3, 4 or 5 annotators 
labeled the utterance with the same class, we la-
beled the utterance with that class. For utterances 
in which 2 annotators voted for one class, 2 for 
another and 1 for the third, we randomly picked 
from one of the classes in which 2 annotators voted 
the same way. We then computed agreement be-
tween this ?voted turker? and each of the two in-
house annotators, and averaged across the 5 meet-
ings. Figure 3 shows these agreement values. The 
left-most point on the ?Kappa Agreement? curve 
shows the average agreement obtained using indi-
vidual turkers (0.19) while the second point shows 
the agreement with the ?voted turker? (0.22). This 
is only a marginal improvement, implying that 
simply voting and using all the data does not im-
prove much over the average agreement of indi-
vidual annotators.  
 The agreement does improve when we consider 
only those utterances that a clear majority of anno-
tators agreed on. The 3rd, 4th and 5th points on the 
?Agreement? curve plot the average agreement 
when considering only those utterances that at least 
3, 4 and 5 turkers agreed on. The ?Fraction of da-
ta? curve plots the fraction of the meeting utter-
ances that fit these agreement criteria. For 
utterances that at least 3 turkers agreed on, the 
kappa agreement value with in-house annotators is 
0.25, and this represents 84% of the data. For about 
50% of the data 4 of 5 turkers agreed, and these 
utterances had a kappa of 0.32. Finally utterances 
for which annotators were unanimous had a kappa 
of 0.37, but represented only 22% of the data. It is 
particularly encouraging to note that although the 
amount of data reduces as we focus on utterances 
that more and more turkers agree on, the utterances 
so labeled are not dominated by any one class. For 
example, among utterances that 4 or more turkers 
agree on, 48% belong to the important class, 48% 
to unimportant class, and the remaining 4% to the 
neutral class. These results show that with voting, 
it is possible to select a subset of utterances that 
have higher agreement rates, implying that they are 
annotated with higher confidence. For future work 
we will investigate whether a summarization sys-
tem trained on only the highly agreed-upon data 
outperforms one trained on all the annotation data.

7 Conclusions 
In this study, we found that MTurk can be used to 
create accurate transcriptions of spontaneous meet-
ing speech when using a two-stage corrective 
process. Our best technique yielded a disagreement 
rate of 15.1%, which is competitive with reported 
disagreement in the literature of 6-12%. We found 
that both fillers and out-of-vocabulary words 
proved troublesome. We also observed that the 
length of the utterance being transcribed wasn?t a 
significant factor in determining WER, but that the 
native language of the speaker was indeed a signif-
icant factor.  
 We also experimented with using MTurk for the 
purpose of labeling utterances for extractive sum-
marization research. We showed that despite the 
lack of training, turkers produce labels with better 
than random agreement with in-house annotators. 
Further, when combined using voting, and with the 
low-agreement utterances filtered out, we can iden-
tify a set of utterances that agree significantly bet-
ter with in-house annotations.  
 In summary, MTurk appears to be a viable re-
source for producing transcription and annotation 
of meeting speech. Producing high-quality outputs, 
however, may require the use of techniques such as 
ensemble voting and iterative correction or refine-
ment that leverage performance of the same task 
by multiple workers.
