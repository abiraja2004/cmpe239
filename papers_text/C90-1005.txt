Abstract 
Recent work in text analysis has suggested 
that data on words that frequently occur to- 
gether reveal important information about 
text content. Co-occurrence relations can 
serve two main purposes in language pro- 
cessing. First, the statistics of co-occurrence 
have been shown to produce accurate results 
in syntactic analysis. Second, the way that 
words appear together can help in assign- 
ing thematic roles in semantic interpreta- 
tion. This paper discusses a method for col- 
lecting co-occurrence data, ~quir ing lexical 
relations from the data, and applying these 
relations to semantic analysis. 
1 Introduction 
Two text processing problems rely heavily on co- 
occurrence patterns-  the way that words appear to- 
gether, possibly idiosyncraticly. First, statistically 
weighted co-occurrence information can assist in the 
"bracketing" of noun groups, which can otherwise 
lead to a eombinatoric explosion of parse trees \[1\]. 
Second, co-occurrence r lations can provide evidence 
of semantic information for thematic-role assignment, 
an important ask that is otherwise fraught with in- 
accuracy. 
Only co-occurrence patterns collected over a corpus 
can help to determine which is .object and which is 
recipient in PAID DIVIDEND (IS SECURE) vs. PAID 
SHAREHOLDERS (ARE SATISFIED). A sufficiently 
rich lexicon would include the semantic preferences 
for distinguishing these thematic roles, but such a 
lexicon does not yet exist. 
Co-occurrence patterns are a means of probing a 
global corpus for clues that help resolve ambiguity at 
the local sentence level. Patterns such as PAID TO 
SHAREHOLDERS and PAID THEM THE DIVIDEND 
are detected in the corpus at large. Through these 
latter examples, in which the distinction between re- 
cipient and object relative to the dative verb PAY is 
made explicit, the former cases in which tile relation 
is implicit can be resolved. 
In contrast o previous work which addressed the 
identification of surface relations, i.e., SVO triples \[2\], 
in our work we address the acquisition of semantic re- 
lations, focussing at the assigment of thematic roles. 
This task (i.e. tagging for acquisition) requires high 
reliability and so it relies less on statistical properties 
and more on deterministic local marking. 
In this paper we discuss a technique for parsing 
and semanticly analyzing complex sentences with the 
aid of co-occurrence relations, and show how these 
relations are acquired from tagged corpus. 
1.1 The  Phenomenon 
Consider, for example, the sentence below, taken 
from the Dow-Jones newswire: 
THE LARGEST CO~iPANY ON THE LIST, 
WHICH LAST PAID SHAREHOLDERS IN JANUARY, 
SAID THE 5 PC STOCK DIVIDEND WOULD BE 
PAYABLE FOLLOWING THE PAYMENT OF THE 
CASH DIVIDEND. (DJ, October 27, 1988) 
For this sentence, which is not exotic or unusual 
in its complexity, there are 24 non-trivial different 
parse trees. Human readers, in contrast to most 
programs, can quickly identify groups of words that 
"hang together" such as COMPANY PAID A DIVI- 
DEND, STOCK DIVIDEND, and CASH DIVIDEND, 
and use these clusters to understand the sentence 
unambiguously. Moreover, a human reader can eas- 
ily recognize SHAREHOLDERS as recipient and DIV- 
IDEND as the object of PAY. Along these lines, our 
program develops the capability to identify such pat- 
terns by training on a large corpus of examples. 
1.2 The  Tra in ing  Corpus  
The training corpus, from which our lexical infor- 
mation is extracted, consists of more than ten rail- 
34 i 
lion words from the Dow Jones newswire (10 months 
worth of stories). For the root PAY, for instance, we 
collected more than 6000 examples, 20 of which are 
given below. 
To exploit this data, a system must transform com- 
mon patterns into operational templates, encoding a
core relation between the words. The sections that 
follow describe the evolution and implementation of
this acquisition technique. 
2 Co-occur rence :  P rev ious  Work  
Garside \[4\] and Church et al \[1\] provided a major 
impetus for this line of work. In Church's work, a 
collection of English collocations bootstrapped from a 
tagged corpus facilitated the construction of an adap- 
tive "tagger", a program that annotates a text with 
part-of-speech information. 
Frank Smadja \[7\] continued Church's effort by 
collecting operational pairs such as verb-noun and 
adjective-noun pairs. Smadja used these pairs to con- 
strain \]\[exical choice in a language generator; for ex- 
ample, the system prefers "deposit a check" to "place 
a check" based on the frequency of co-occurrence of
deposit and check. 
Ido Dagan \[3\] pursued this topic further by pro- 
jecting co-occurrences beyond the local context, us- 
ing collocations for anaphora resolution. For example 
in, 
THE CAR WAS DRIVING ON THE ROAD. 
SUDDENLY IT BRAKED. 
CAR is selected over ROAD as the anaphor of IT, since 
CAR BRAKE is a stronger collocation than ROAD 
BRAKE.  Interestingly, this idea complements Wilks' 
preference semantics \[8\], in which preference is based 
on a semantic hierarchy. In Dagan's method, prefer- 
ences are based on word patterns acquired from cor- 
pus. 
Our work further emphasizes globM-sentence con- 
nections. An example that highlights the use of co- 
occurrence is given on the next page. 
THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRANKL- 
IN FIRST FEDERAL SAVINGS ~ LOAN ASSOCIAT- 
ION OF WILKES-BARRE, \[SAID\] FRANKLIN FIRST 
FEDERAL'S PLAN OF CONVERSION HAD BEEN 
APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK 
BOARD \[AND THAT\] THE OFFERING OF COMMON 
SHARES IN FRANKLIN FIRST FINANCIAL CORP. 
HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE BANK BOARD AND BY 
THE SEC. (D J, 07-25-88). 
What  is the attachment of THAT?  THAT could 
potentially attach to almost any preceding word, 
e.g., FEDERAL THAT, BOARD THAT, CONVERSION 
THAT, SAID THAT, etc. The affinity of the word 
pair SAY THAT (although it does not appear in this 
sentence as a collocation) supports the appropriate 
attachment. 
Furthermore, co-occurrence relations support 
thematic-role assignment. This is important for our 
ultimate objective of producing more accurate con- 
ceptual information from news stories \[5\]. The text 
below illustrates one type of problem in role assign- 
ment: 
THE LARGEST COMPANY ON THE LIST, 
WHICH LAST PAID SHAREHOLDERS IN JANUARY, 
SAID THE 5 PC STOCK DIVIDEND WOULD BE 
PAYABLE FOLLOWING THE PAYMENT OF THE 
CASH DIVIDEND. (D J, October 27, 1988) 
Who paid what to whom and when? Co- 
occurrence-based analysis generates lexical relations 
such as subj-verb, verb-obj, and verb-obj2, relations 
which are further mapped into appropriate thematic 
and semantic roles. The program thus determines 
that COMPANY is the payer of PAID, SHAREHOLD- 
ERS the payee, and DIVIDEND the payment. 
3 Lex ica l  Representat ion  
An acquired lexical structure called a Thematic Re- 
lations (Figure 2) facilitates this analysis. For a pair 
of content words, a relation provides (1) a strength of 
association (or "mutual affinity"), and (2) a structure 
type. 
This table is acquired from corpus by a tagger 
based on morphology and local syntax. 
4 Ext ract ing  Co-occur rence  
Re la t ions  f rom Corpus  
The algorithm operates in three steps: (1) tag the 
corpus for morphology and part of speech, (2) col- 
lect collocations using relative frequency, and (3) use 
tagging to determine lexical relations within colloca- 
tions. 
4.1 Part-of-speech Tagging 
Since the corpus size is about 10-million words, a full- 
fledged global sentence parsing is prohibitively ex- 
pensive, and tagging must be carried out by localist 
methods, i.e., by means of morphology and local syn- 
tactic markers. There are three degrees of difficulty 
of cases to be tagged. 
Morpho logy-based  Tagging: Only a few words 
can be tagged using morphology alone. While 
PAYMENT and SHAREHOLDERS are unambigu- 
ously nouns, morphology-based tagging is am- 
biguous for most words. For example, PAID and 
SAID could be either verb or adjective (i.e. par- 
ticiple modifier); STOCK and CASH could be ei- 
ther noun or verb.

Syntax-based  Tagging: Local syntactic markers 
help to remove most cases of ambiguity. For ex- 
ample, was SAID (read: the word SAID preceded 
by was) can be unambiguously tagged a verb; 
the PAID shareholders, is an adjective; and the 
STOCK is definitely a noun. 
S tat i s t i cs -Based Tagging: Taggers reported by \[4; 
1\] have capitalized on a large collection of bi- 
grams plus statistically weighted grammar ules. 
In this method, statistical properties are ac- 
quired from a large training corpus which was 
tagged manually. Statistical methods have 
proved very effective, and attained a high level 
of accuracy \[6\]. 
4.2 P rob lemat ic  Cases 
Some cases prove even more difficult and cannot be 
resolved by localist methods. Consider the following 
two examples. 
? "The company preferred stock PAID . . . "  . In 
this clause, PAID, could be either an adjective 
or a verb (see "the horse raced past the barn"). 
Indeed, this clause could probably be determined 
by a global parse, however, this would be too 
expensive computationally. 
? "CONVINCING MANAGEMENT proved tough" 
is even harder since it presents a Necker cube 
situation (i. e. changing the interpretation of 
either word seems immediately to change the in- 
terpretation of the pair). Is it an adjective-noun 
or is it a verb-noun pair? In general, the analy- 
sis of such pairs requires deeper understanding of 
word relationships. Consider another example: 
LATER IN THE DAY BUYING INTEREST 
DIMINISHED . . . 
Again, it is difficult to tell whether INTEI~EST 
in BUYING diminished or the BUYING of IN- 
TERESTs diminished. Thus, local clues do not 
contribute towards the proper resolution of such 
cc'~3es. 
The incorrect resolution of such cases, which un- 
fortunately are pervasive in the corpus, impinges on 
two objectives: performance and learning. 
In order to perform text analysis, in the first case 
one must determine whether management was con- 
vinced, or the management convinced some second 
party; in the second case, one must determine the 
subject of the main verb of the sentence, i.e., which 
is the ,subject of DIMINISHED? Many applications 
require an unambiguous result. Thus a call must be 
made one way or another. Statistical means might 
make that call slightly more judiciuos on the aver- 
age. 
However, when tagging is used for learning of the- 
matic roles, inappropriate r solution of such cases can 
drastically contaminate the final results by biasing it 
in a certain direction. Results are far more accurate 
when ambiguous cases are left out altogether. 
4.3 Tagging for Learn ing  
Our tagger is based on a 7,000-root lexicon that facili- 
tates accurate morphological nalysis, and about I00 
local-syntax rules. It produces tagging for about 60% 
of the content words in the corpus. Tagged output 
for a sample sentence is given below. 
THE///DT LARGEST/IARGE/EST/AD CONPANYI//NN 
oNIIIPP THE///DT LIST///ml *co~ma*///SP

FOLLOW/ING/?? THE///DT PAYMENT/PAY/HENT/NN 
OF///PP THE///DT CASH///NN DIVIDEND///NN 
*period*///SP 
A 4-tuple in the sentence above is a 
word/root/affix/part-of-speech. As expected, many 
content words in this sentence cannot be unambigu- 
ously tagged, and are marked ?, i.e., undetermined. 
In particular, notice that PAID remains unresolved. 
Fortunately, most PAY cases in the corpus are sim- 
pler and are appropriately tagged.

THE///DT COMPANY///NN LAST///JJ PAID/PAY/ED 
/VA A///DT 5///NN DIVIDEND///NN 0N///PP ,,\]'A- 
NUARYI I IDD . . .  
For purposes of thematic role acquisition the iden- 
tification of passive and active voice is crucial. In the 
sample sentence above, PAID is appropriately tagged 
as a verb in the active voice (marked as VA). 
4.4 Col lect ing Col locat ions 
Based on the tagging above (the root field), all collo- 
cations in the corpus are counted, and the following 
table is generated. 
This table is similar to Smadja's \[7\], and it provides 
the position of collocative words relative to PAY, and 
the total count within 4 words in either direction. 
4.5 Determin ing  Lexical  Relat ions 
Lexical relations are determined using the known 
functionality of the verb (see \[9\]) and supporting ex- 
amples. PAY is marked in the lexicon as a dative 
verb. 
Consider 5 cases containing the pair PAY SHARE- 
HOLDER, from which the thematic relation is in- 
duced (VA stands for verb, active voice; VP  for verb, 
passive voice; AD for adjective).

5 Cur rent  S ta tus  and  Conc lus ions  
Based on a number of tagged sentences, the system 
determines that SHAREHOLDERS are recipients of 
PAY, while DIVIDENDS axe objects. This general- 
ized lexical relation enables the semantic resolution 
of more difficult cases uch as DIVIDEND PAYMENT 
and COMPANY PAID STOCK DIVIDEND. 
The implemented system using these techniques 
includes several elements: (1) morphology analysis 
- currently produces accurate results for all the re- 
quired cases; (2) tagging - produces results for only 
60% of the required examples; more detailed rules 
could improve this figure to about 70%; (3) rule form- 
ing - currently works only with dative verbs such as 
PAY and SELL. 
A number of important pieces of recent research 
have highlighted the power of co-occurrence informa- 
tion in text. In the techniques described here, we 
have extended this research to use co-occurrence in- 
formation for discriminating thematic roles. These 
techniques combine data acquisition from a tagged 
corpus with relation-driven language analysis to de- 
rive thematic knowledge from the text.
