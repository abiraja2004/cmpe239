Abstract 
Thesauri and ontologies provide impor-
tant value in facilitating access to digital 
archives by representing underlying prin-
ciples of organization.  Translation of 
such resources into multiple languages is 
an important component for providing 
multilingual access.  However, the speci-
ficity of vocabulary terms in most on-
tologies precludes fully-automated ma-
chine translation using general-domain 
lexical resources.  In this paper, we pre-
sent an efficient process for leveraging 
human translations when constructing 
domain-specific lexical resources.  We 
evaluate the effectiveness of this process 
by producing a probabilistic phrase dic-
tionary and translating a thesaurus of 
56,000 concepts used to catalogue a large 
archive of oral histories.  Our experi-
ments demonstrate a cost-effective tech-
nique for accurate machine translation of 
large ontologies. 
1 Introduction 
Multilingual access to digital collections is an 
important problem in today?s increasingly inter-
connected world.  Although technologies such as 
cross-language information retrieval and ma-
chine translation help humans access information 
they could not otherwise find or understand, they 
are often inadequate for highly specific domains. 
Most digital collections of any significant size 
use a system of organization that facilitates easy 
access to collection contents. Generally, the or-
ganizing principles are captured in the form of a 
controlled vocabulary of keyword phrases (de-
scriptors) representing specific concepts.  These 
descriptors are usually arranged in a hierarchic 
thesaurus or ontology, and are assigned to collec-
tion items as a means of providing access (either 
via searching for keyword phases, browsing the 
hierarchy, or a combination both).  MeSH (Medi-
cal Subject Headings) serves as a good example 
of such an ontology; it is a hierarchically-
arranged collection of controlled vocabulary 
terms manually assigned to medical abstracts in a 
number of databases.  It provides multilingual 
access to the contents of these databases, but 
maintaining translations of such a complex struc-
ture is challenging (Nelson, et al 2004). 
For the most part, research in multilingual in-
formation access focuses on the content of digital 
repositories themselves, often neglecting signifi-
cant knowledge that is explicitly encoded in the 
associated ontologies.  However, information 
systems cannot utilize such ontologies by simply 
applying off-the-shelf machine translation. Gen-
eral-purpose translation resources provide insuf-
ficient coverage of the vocabulary contained 
within these domain-specific ontologies. 
This paper tackles the question of how one 
might efficiently translate a large-scale ontology 
to facilitate multilingual information access.  If 
we need humans to assist in the translation proc-
ess, how can we maximize access while mini-
mizing cost?  Because human translation is asso-
ciated with a certain cost, it is preferable not to 
incur costs of retranslation whenever compo-
nents of translated text are reused. Moreover, 
when exhaustive human translation is not practi-
cal, the most ?useful? components should be 
translated first.  Identifying reusable elements 
and prioritizing their translation based on utility 
is essential to maximizing effectiveness and re-
ducing cost. 
945
We present a process of prioritized translation 
that balances the issues discussed above.  Our 
work is situated in the context of the MALACH 
project, an NSF-funded effort to improve multi-
lingual information access to large archives of 
spoken language (Gustman, et al, 2002).  Our 
process leverages a small set of manually-
acquired English-Czech translations to translate a 
large ontology of keyword phrases, thereby pro-
viding Czech speakers access to 116,000 hours 
of video testimonies in 32 languages. Starting 
from an initial out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of 
85%, we show that a small set of prioritized 
translations can be elicited from human infor-
mants, aligned, decomposed and then recom-
bined to cover 90% of the access value in a com-
plex ontology.  Moreover, we demonstrate that 
prioritization based on hierarchical position and 
frequency of use facilitates extremely efficient 
reuse of human input.  Evaluations show that our 
technique is able to boost performance of a sim-
ple translation system by 65%. 
2 The Problem 
The USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Vis-
ual History and Education manages what is pres-
ently the world's largest archive of videotaped 
oral histories (USC, 2006). The archive contains 
116,000 hours of video from the testimonies of 
over 52,000 survivors, liberators, rescuers and 
witnesses of the Holocaust.  If viewed end to 
end, the collection amounts to 13 years of con-
tinuous video.  The Shoah Foundation uses a hi-
erarchically arranged thesaurus of 56,000 key-
word phrases representing domain-specific con-
cepts.  These are assigned to time-points in the 
video testimonies as a means of indexing the 
video content.  Although the testimonies in the 
collection represent 32 different languages, the 
thesaurus used to catalog them is currently avail-
able only in English.  Our task was to translate 
this resource to facilitate multilingual access, 
with Czech as the first target language. 
Our first pass at automating thesaurus transla-
tion revealed that only 15% of the words in the 
vocabulary could be found in an available 
aligned corpus (?mejrek, et al, 2004).  The rest 
of the vocabulary was not available from general 
resources.  Lexical information for translating 
these terms had to be acquired from human in-
put.  Reliable access to digital archives requires 
accuracy. Highly accurate human translations 
incur a cost that is generally proportional to the 
number of words being translated.  However, the 
keyword phrases in the Shoah Foundation?s ar-
chive occur in a Zipfian distribution?a rela-
tively small number of terms provide access to a 
large portion of the video content.  Similarly, a 
great number of highly specific terms describe 
only a small fraction of content.  Therefore, not 
every keyword phrase in the thesaurus carries the 
same value for access to the archive.  The hierar-
chical arrangement of keyword phrases presents 
another issue: some concepts, while not of great 
value for access to segments of video, may be 
important for organizing other concepts and for 
browsing the hierarchy.  These factors must be 
balanced in developing a cost-effective process 
that maximizes utility. 
3 Our Solution 
This paper presents a prioritized human-in-the-
loop approach to translating large-scale ontolo-
gies that is fast, efficient, and cost effective.  Us-
ing this approach, we collected 3,000 manual 
translations of keyword phrases and reused the 
translated terms to generate a lexicon for auto-
mated translation of the rest of the thesaurus.  
The process begins by prioritizing keyword 
phrases for manual translation in terms of their 
value in accessing the collection and the reus-
ability of their component terms.  Translations 
collected from one human informant are then 
checked and aligned to the original English terms 
by a second informant.  From these alignments 
we induce a probabilistic English-Czech phrase 
dictionary.   
To test the effectiveness of this process we 
implemented a simple translation system that 
utilizes the newly generated lexical resources.  
Section 4 reports on two evaluations of the trans-
lation output that quantify the effectiveness of 
our human-in-the-loop approach. 
3.1 Maximizing Value and Reusability 
To quantify their utility, we defined two values 
for each keyword phrase in the thesaurus: a the-
saurus value, representing the importance of the 
keyword phrase for providing access to the col-
lection, and a translation value, representing the 
usefulness of having the keyword phrase trans-
lated.  These values are not identical, but the 
second is related to the first. 
Thesaurus value: Keyword phrases in the 
Shoah Foundation?s thesaurus are arranged into a 
poly-hierarchy in which child nodes may have 
multiple parents.  Internal (non-leaf) nodes of the 
hierarchy are used to organize concepts and sup-
port concept browsing.  Some internal nodes are 
also used to index video content.  Leaf nodes are 
946
very specific and are only used to index video 
content.  Thus, the usefulness of any keyword 
phrase for providing access to the digital collec-
tion is directly related to the concept?s position in 
the thesaurus hierarchy. 
A fragment of the hierarchy is shown in Fig-
ure 1. The keyword phrase ?Auschwitz II-
Birkenau (Poland: Death Camp)?, which de-
scribes a Nazi death camp, is assigned to 17,555 
video segments in the collection.  It has broader 
(parent) terms and narrower (child) terms.  Some 
of the broader and narrower terms are also as-
signed to segments, but not all.  Notably, ?Ger-
man death camps? is not assigned to any video 
segments.  However, ?German death camps? has 
very important narrower terms including 
?Auschwitz II-Birkenau? and others. 
From this example, we can see that an internal 
node is valuable in providing access to its chil-
dren, even if the keyword phrase itself is not as-
signed to any segments.  The value we assign to 
any term must reflect this fact.  If we were to 
reduce cost by translating only the nodes as-
signed to video segments, we would neglect 
nodes that are crucial for browsing.  However, if 
we value a node by the sum value of all its chil-
dren, grandchildren, etc., the resulting calcula-
tion would bias the top of the hierarchy.  Any 
prioritization based on this method would lead to 
translation of the top of the hierarchy first.  
Given limited resources, leaf nodes might never 
be translated.  Support for searching and brows-
ing calls for different approaches to prioritization. 
To strike a balance between these factors, we 
calculate a thesaurus value, which represents the 
importance of each keyword phrase to the the-
saurus as a whole.  This value is computed as: 
( ) ( )kchildren
h
scounth kchildreni ikk
? ?+= )(  
For leaf nodes in our thesaurus, this value is sim-
ply the number of video segments to which the 
concept has been assigned.  For parent nodes, the 
thesaurus value is the number of segments (if 
any) to which the node has been assigned, plus 
the average of the thesaurus value of any child 
nodes. 
This recursive calculation yields a micro-
averaged value that represents the reachability of  
segments via downward edge traversals from a 
given node in the hierarchy.  That is, it gives a 
kind of weighted value for the number of seg-
ments described by a given keyword phrase or its 
narrower-term keyword phrases. 
 
For example, in Figure 2 each of the leaf 
nodes n3, n4, and n5 have values based solely on 
the number of segments to which they are as-
signed. Node n1 has value both as an access point 
to the segments at s2 and as an access point to the 
keyword phrases at nodes n3 and n4.  Other inter-
nal nodes, such as n2 have value only in provid-
ing access to other nodes/keyword phrases. 
Working from the bottom of the hierarchy up to 
the primary node (n0) we can compute the the-
saurus value for each node in the hierarchy.  In 
our example, we start with nodes n3 through n5, 
counting the number of the segments that have 
been assigned each keyword phrase.  Then we 
move up to nodes n1 and n2.  At n1 we count the 
number of segments s2 to which n1 was assigned 
and add that count to the average of the thesau-
rus values for n3, and n4.  At n2 we simply aver-
age the thesaurus values for n4 and n5.  The final 
values quantify how valuable the translation of 
any given keyword phrase would be in providing 
access to video segments. 
Translation value: After obtaining the the-
saurus value for each node, we can compute the 
translation value for each word in the vocabulary

as the sum of the thesaurus value for every key-
word phrase that contains that word: 
tw= ?
?? wk
kh   where Kw={x | phrase x contains w} 
For example, the word ?Auschwitz? occurs in 35 
concepts.  As a candidate for translation, it car-
ries a large impact, both in terms of the number 
of keyword phrases that contains this word, and 
the potential value of those keyword phrases 
(once they are translated) in providing access to 
segments in the archive.  The end result is a list 
of vocabulary words and the impact that correct 
translation of each word would have on the over-
all value of the translated thesaurus. 
We elicited human translations of entire key-
word phrases rather than individual vocabulary 
terms.  Having humans translate individual 
words without their surrounding context would 
have been less efficient.  Also, the value any 
keyword phrase holds for translation is only indi-
rectly related to its own value as a point of access 
to the collection (i.e., its thesaurus value).  Some 
keyword phrases contain words with high trans-
lation value, but the keyword phrase itself has 
low thesaurus value.  Thus, the value gained by 
translating any given phrase is more accurately 
estimated by the total value of any untranslated 
words it contains. Therefore, we prioritized the 
order of keyword phrase translations based on 
the translation value of the untranslated words in 
each keyword phrase. 
Our next step was to iterate through the the-
saurus keyword phrases, prioritizing their trans-
lation based on the assumption that any words 
contained in a keyword phrase of higher priority 
would already have been translated.  Starting 
from the assumption that the entire thesaurus is 
untranslated, we select the one keyword phrase 
that contains the most valuable un-translated 
words?we simply add up the translation value 
of all the untranslated words in each keyword 
phrase, and select the keyword phrase with the 
highest value.  We add this keyword phrase to a 
prioritized list of items to be manually translated 
and we remove it from the list of untranslated 
phrases.  We update our vocabulary list and, as-
suming translations of all the words in the prior 
keyword phrase to now be translated (neglecting 
issues such as morphology), we again select the 
keyword phrase that contains the most valuable 
untranslated words.  We iterate the process until 
all vocabulary terms have been included at least 
one keyword phrases on the prioritized list.  Ul-
timately we end up with an ordered list of the 
keyword phrases that should be translated to 
cover the entire vocabulary, with the most impor-
tant words being covered first. 
A few words about additional characteristics 
of this approach: note that it is greedy and biased 
toward longer keyword phrases.  As a result, 
some words may be translated more than once 
because they appear in more than one keyword 
phrase with high translation value.  This side 
effect is actually desirable.  To build an accurate 
translation dictionary, it is helpful to have more 
than one translation of frequently occuring words, 
especially for morphologically rich languages 
such as Czech.  Our technique makes the opera-
tional assumption that translations of a word 
gathered in one context can be reused in another 
context.  Obviously this is not always true, but 
contexts of use are relatively stable in controlled 
vocabularies.  Our evaluations address the ac-
ceptability of this operational assumption and 
demonstrate that the technique yields acceptable 
translations. 
Following this process model, the most impor-
tant elements of the thesaurus will be translated 
first, and the most important vocabulary terms 
will quickly become available for automated 
translation of keyword phrases with high thesau-
rus value that do not make it onto the prioritized 
list for manual translation (i.e., low translation 
value).  The overall access value of the thesaurus 
rises very quickly after initial translations.  With 
each subsequent human translation of keyword 
phrases on the prioritized list, we gain tremen-
dous value in terms of providing non-English 
access to the collection of video testimonies.  
Figure 3 shows this rate of gain.  It can be seen 
that prioritization based on translation value 
gives a much higher yield of total access than 
prioritization based on thesaurus value.

3.2 Alignment and Decomposition 
Following the prioritization scheme above, we 
obtained professional translations for the top 
3000 English keyword phrases.  We tokenized 
these translations and presented them to another 
bilingual Czech speaker for verification and 
alignment.  This second informant marked each 
Czech word in a translated keyword phrase with 
a link to the equivalent English word(s).  Multi-
ple links were used to convey the relationship 
between a single word in one language and a 
string of words in another.  The output of the 
alignment process was then used to build a prob-
abilistic dictionary of words and phrases. 
 
Figure 4. Sample alignment 
Figure 4 shows an example of an aligned 
tranlsation.  The word ?stills? is recorded as a 
translation for ?statick? sn?mky? and ?kl??tery? 
is recorded as a translation for ?convents and 
monasteries.?  We count the number of occur-
rences of each alignment in all of the translations 
and calculate probabilities for each Czech word 
or phrase given an English word or phrase.  For 
example, in the top 3000 keyword phrases 
?stills? appears 29 times.  It was aligned with 
?statick? sn?mky? 28 times and only once with 
?statick? z?b?ry?, giving us a translation prob-
ability of 28/29=0.9655 for ?statick? sn?mky?. 
Human translation of the 3000 English key-
word phrases into Czech took approximately 70 
hours, and the alignments took 55 hours.  The 
overall cost of human input (translation and 
alignment) was less than 1000 ?.  The projected 
cost of full translation for the entire thesaurus 
would have been close to 20000 ? and would not 
have produced any reusable resources.  Naturally, 
costs for building resources in this manner will 
vary, but in our case the cost savings is approxi-
mately twenty fold. 
3.3 Machine Translation 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, 
we show that a probabilistic dictionary, induced 
through the process we just described, facilitates 
high quality machine translation of the rest of the 
thesaurus.  We evaluated translation quality us-
ing a relatively simple translation system.  How-
ever, more sophisticated systems can draw equal 
benefit from the same lexical resources. 
Our translation system implemented a greedy 
coverage algorithm with a simple back-off strat-
egy.  It first scans the English input to find the 
longest matching substring in our dictionary, and 
replaces it with the most likely Czech translation.  
Building on the example above, the system looks 
up ?monasteries and convents stills? in the dic-
tionary, finds no translation, and backs off to 
?monasteries and convents?, which is translated 
to ?kl??tery?.  Had this phrase translation not 
been found, the system would have attempted to 
find a match for the individual tokens.  Failing a 
match in our dictionary, the system then backs 
off to the Prague Czech-English Dependency 
Treebank dictionary, a much larger dictionary 
with broader scope.  If no match is found in ei-
ther dictionary for the full token, we stem the 
token and look for matches based on the stem.  
Finally, tokens whose translations can not be 
found are simply passed through untranslated. 
A minimal set of heuristic rules was applied to 
reordering the Czech tokens but the output is 
primarily phrase by phrase/word by word transla-
tion.  Our evaluation scores below will partially 
reflect the simplicity of our system.  Our system 
is simple by design.  Any improvement or degra-
dation to the input of our system has direct influ-
ence on the output.  Thus, measures of transla-
tion accuracy for our system can be directly in-
terpreted as quality measures for the lexical re-
sources used and the process by which they were 
developed. 
4 Evaluation 
We performed two different types of evaluation 
to validate our process.  First, we compared our 
system output to human reference translations 
using Bleu (Papineni, et al, 2002), a widely-
accepted objective metric for evaluation of ma-
chine translations.  Second, we showed corrected 
and uncorrected machine translations to Czech 
speakers and collected subjective judgments of 
fluency and accuracy. 
For evaluation purposes, we selected 418 
keyword phrases to be used as target translations.  
These phrases were selected using a stratified 
sampling technique so that different levels of 
thesaurus value would be represented.  There 
was no overlap between these keyword phrases 
and the 3000 prioritized keyword phrases used to 
build our lexicon.  Prior to machine translation 
we obtained at least two independent human-
generated reference translations for each of the 
418 keyword phrases. 
monasteries convents and stills ( ) 
statick? kl??tery sn?mky ( ) 
949
After collecting the first 2500 prioritized 
translations, we induced a probabilistic diction-
ary and generated machine translations of the 
418 target keyword phrases. These were then 
corrected by native Czech speakers, who ad-
justed word order, word choice, and morphology. 
We use this set of human-corrected machine 
translations as a second reference for evaluation. 
Measuring the difference between our uncor-
rected machine translations (MT) and the human-
generated reference establishes how accurate our 
translations are compared to an independently 
established target.  Measuring the difference be-
tween our MT and the human-corrected machine 
translations (corrected MT) establishes how ac-
ceptable our translations are.  We also measured 
the difference between corrected MT and the 
human-generated translations.  We take this to be 
an upper bound on realistic system performance. 
The results from our objective evaluation are 
shown in Figure 5.  Each set of bars in the graph 
shows performance after adding a different num-
ber of aligned translations into the lexicon (i.e., 
performance after adding 500, 1000, ..., 3000 
aligned translations.)  The zero condition is our 
baseline: translations generated using only the 
dictionary available in the Prague Czech-English 
Dependency Treebank.  Three different reference 
sets are shown: human-generated, corrected MT, 
and a combination of the two. 
There is a notable jump in Bleu score after the 
very first translations are added into our prob-
abilistic dictionary.  Without any elicitation and 
alignment we got a baseline score of 0.46 
(against the human-generated reference transla-
tions).  After the aligned terms from only 500 
translations were added to our dictionary, our 
Bleu score rose to 0.66.  After aligned terms 
from 3000 translations were added, we achieved 
0.69.  Using corrected MT as the reference our 
Bleu scores improve from 0.48 to 0.79.  If hu-
man-generated and human-corrected references 
are both considered to be correct translations, the 
improvement goes from .49 to .80.  Regardless 
of the reference set, there is a consistent per-
formance improvement as more and more trans-
lations are added.  We found the same trend us-
ing the TER metric on a smaller data set 
(Murray, et al, 2006).  The fact that the Bleu 
scores continue to rise indicates that our ap-
proach is successful in quickly expanding the 
lexicon with accurate translations.  It is important 
to point out that Bleu scores are not meaningful 
in an absolute sense; the scores here should be 
interpreted with respect to each other.  The trend 
in scores strongly indicates that our prioritization 
scheme is effective for generating a high-quality 
translation lexicon at relatively low cost.   
To determine an upper bound on machine per-
formance, we compared our corrected MT output 
to the initial human-generated reference transla-
tions, which were collected prior to machine 
translation.  Corrected MT achieved a Bleu score 
of 0.82 when compared to the human-generated 
reference translations.  This upper bound is the 
?limit? indicated in Figure 5. 
To determine the impact of external resources, 
we removed the Prague Czech-English Depend-
ency Treebank dictionary as a back-off resource 
and retranslated keyword phrases using only the 
lexicons induced from our aligned translations.  
The results of this experiment showed only mar-
ginal degradation of the output.  Even when as 
few as 500 aligned translations were used for our 
dictionary, we still achieved a Bleu score of 0.65 
against the human reference translations.  This 
means that even for languages where prior re-
sources are not available our prioritization 
scheme successfully addresses the OOV problem. 
In our subjective evaluation, we presented a 
random sample of our system output to seven

native Czech speakers and collected judgments 
of accuracy and fluency using a 5-point Likert 
scale (1=good, 3=neutral, 5=bad).  An overview 
of the results is presented in Figure 6.  Scores are 
shown for corrected and uncorrected MT.  In all 
cases, the mode is 1 (i.e., good fluency and good 
accuracy).  59% of the machine translated 
phrases were rated 2 or better for fluency.  66% 
were rated 2 or better for accuracy.  Only a small 
percentage of the translations had meanings that 
were far from the intended meaning.  Disfluen-
cies were primarily due to errors in morphology 
and word order.  
5 Related Work  
Several studies have taken a knowledge-
acquisition approach to collecting multilingual 
word pairs.  For example, Sadat et al (2003) 
automatically extracted bilingual word pairs 
from comparable corpora.  This approach is 
based on the simple assumption that if two words 
are mutual translations, then their most frequent 
collocates are likely to be mutual translations as 
well.  However, the approach requires large com-
parable corpora, the collection of which presents 
non-trivial challenges.  Others have made similar 
mutual-translation assumptions for lexical acqui-
sition (Echizen-ya, et al, 2005; Kaji & Aizono, 
1996; Rapp, 1999; Tanaka & Iwasaki, 1996).  
Most make use of either parallel corpora or a 
bilingual dictionary for the task of bilingual term 
extraction.  Echizen-ya, et al (2005) avoided 
using a bilingual dictionary, but required a paral-
lel corpus to achieve their goal; whereas Fung 
(2000) and others have relied on pre-existing 
bilingual dictionaries.  In either case, large bilin-
gual resources of some kind are required.  In ad-
dition, these approaches focused on the extrac-
tion of single-word pairs, not phrasal units. 
Many recent approaches to dictionary and the-
saurus translation are geared toward providing 
domain-specific thesauri to specialists in a par-
ticular field, e.g., medical terminology (D?jean, 
et al, 2005) and agricultural terminology (Chun 
& Wenlin, 2002).  Researchers on these projects 
are faced with either finding human translators 
who are specialized enough to manage the do-
main-particular translations?or applying auto-
matic techniques to large-scale parallel corpora 
where data sparsity poses a problem for low-
frequency terms.  Data sparsity is also an issue 
for more general state-of-the-art bilingual align-
ment approaches (Brown, et al, 2000; Och & 
Ney, 2003; Wantanabe & Sumita, 2003). 
6 Conclusion 
The task of translating large ontologies can be 
recast as a problem of implementing fast and ef-
ficient processes for acquiring task-specific lexi-
cal resources.  We developed a method for pri-
oritizing keyword phrases from an English the-
saurus of concepts and elicited Czech transla-
tions for a subset of the keyword phrases.  From 
these, we decomposed phrase elements for reuse 
in an English-Czech probabilistic dictionary.  We 
then applied the dictionary in machine translation 
of the rest of the thesaurus.   
Our results show an overall improvement in 
machine translation quality after collecting only 
a few hundred human translations.  Translation 
quality continued to rise as more and more hu-
man translations were added.  The test data used 
in our evaluations are small relative to the overall 
task.  However, we fully expect these results to 
hold across larger samples and for more sophisti-
cated translation systems.   
We leveraged the reusability of translated 
words to translate a thesaurus of 56,000 keyword 
phrases using information gathered from only 
3000 manual translations.  Our probabilistic dic-
tionary was acquired at a fraction of the cost of 
manually translating the entire thesaurus.  By 
prioritizing human translations based on the 
translation value of the words and the thesaurus 
value of the keyword phrases in which they ap-
pear, we optimized the rate of return on invest-
ment. This allowed us to choose a trade-off point 
between cost and utility.  For this project we 
chose to stop human translation at a point where 
less than 0.01% of the value of the thesaurus 
would be gained from each additional human 
translation.  This choice produced a high-quality 
lexicon with significant positive impact on ma-
chine translation systems.  For other applications, 
a different trade-off point will be appropriate, 
depending on the initial OOV rate and the impor-
tance of detailed coverage. 
The value of our work lies in the process 
model we developed for cost-effective elicitation 
of lexical resources.  The metrics we established 
for assessing the impact of each translation item 
are key to our approach.  We use these to opti-
mize the value gained from each human transla-
tion.  In our case the items were keyword phrases 
arranged in a hierarchical thesaurus that de-
scribes an ontology of concepts.  The operational 
value of these keyword phrases was determined 
by the access they provide to video segments in a 
large archive of oral histories.  However, our 
technique is not limited to this application.

We have shown that careful prioritization of 
elicited human translations facilitates cost-
effective thesaurus translation with minimal hu-
man input.  Our use of a prioritization scheme 
addresses the most important deficiencies in the 
vocabulary first.  We induced a framework 
where the utility of lexical resources gained from 
each additional human translation becomes 
smaller and smaller.  Under such a framework, 
choosing the number of human translation to 
elicit becomes merely a function of the financial 
resources available for the task.
