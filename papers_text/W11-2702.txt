Abstract
Recent years have seen a trend towards em-
pirically motivated and more data-driven ap-
proaches in the field of referring expression
generation (REG). Much of this work has fo-
cussed on initial reference to objects in visual
scenes. While this scenario of use is one of
the strongest contenders for real-world appli-
cations of referring expression generation, ex-
isting data sets still only embody very sim-
ple stimulus scenes. To move this research
forward, we require data sets built around in-
creasingly complex scenes, and we need much
larger data sets to accommodate their higher
dimensionality. To control the complexity,
we also need to adopt a hypothesis-driven ap-
proach to scene design. In this paper, we de-
scribe GRE3D7, the largest corpus of human-
produced distinguishing descriptions available
to date, discuss the hypotheses that underlie its
design, and offer a number of analyses of the
4480 descriptions it contains.
1 Introduction
Whenever we engage in any form of discourse we
need to find a way to describe to our readers or
listeners the entities that we are talking or writing
about. This act of referring to real-world entities is
one of the central tasks in human language produc-
tion. Of course, it is also central when a machine
is charged with the task of generating natural lan-
guage, which makes referring expression generation
(REG) an important subtask in any natural language
generation (NLG) system.
It is therefore not surprising that REG has attracted
a great deal of attention from the NLG community
over the past three decades. A key factor that has
led to the popularity of REG is the widespread agree-
ment that the central task involved is content selec-
tion: choosing those attributes of a target referent
that best distinguish it from other distractor enti-
ties around it (Dale and Reiter, 1995; van Deemter,
2000; Gardent, 2002; Krahmer et al, 2003; Ho-
racek, 2003; van der Sluis, 2005; Kelleher and Krui-
jff, 2006; Gatt, 2007; Viethen and Dale, 2008).
Recent work in particular has concentrated on the
development of algorithms concerned with the gen-
eration of context-free identifying descriptions of
objects, as emphasised by three shared-task evalu-
ation competitions (STECs) targeting this particular
problem (Belz and Gatt, 2007; Gatt et al, 2008; Gatt
et al, 2009). Referring expressions of this kind are
often referred to as distinguishing descriptions. We
are still far from a full understanding of how such
descriptions should best be generated. Much work
remains to be done before many issues, such as, for
example, the generation of relational descriptions
and over-specified descriptions or the number of the
surrounding objects to be taken into account in vi-
sual settings, can be considered resolved.
Although many authors have explicitly or implic-
itly acknowledged the importance of generating re-
ferring expressions that sound natural (Dale, 1989;
Dale and Reiter, 1995; Gardent et al, 2004; Ho-
racek, 2004; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2004;
Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006; Gatt, 2007; Gatt et al,
2007), much of the original work in REG was nei-
ther developed based on empirical evidence about
12

how humans refer, nor evaluated against human-
produced referring expressions. The REG STECs on
the task of content determination form part of a re-
cent trend towards more data-oriented development
and evaluation of REG algorithms that responds di-
rectly to this concern (Gupta and Stent, 2005; Jordan
and Walker, 2005; Gatt et al, 2007; Viethen et al,
2010; Belz and Gatt, 2007; Gatt et al, 2008; Gatt et
al., 2009).
However, the existing data sets used in these
experiments involve very simple and usually ab-
stract visual displays of objects rather than coher-
ent scenes. This is a reasonable starting point for
bootstrapping research; but if we want to develop
algorithms that can be used in real-world scenarios,
we ultimately need to work with scenes which are
much more realistic. At the same time, given the
non-deterministic nature of choice in the production
of natural language, corpora based on these scenes
need to be very large, and should ideally contain re-
ferring expressions from as many different speakers
as possible for each target referent in each referential
scenario. The choice of stimuli and data collection
procedure should provide a controlled environment
that allows the isolation of a small number of factors
influencing the choices that have to be made by the
participants, in order to facilitate the replication of
the same controlled environment for REG algorithms
attempting the same reference task in an evaluation
situation. The way forward, we believe, is to build a
succession of corpora with incrementally more com-
plex scenes.
In this paper, we describe the design of a data col-
lection experiment for distinguishing descriptions
and give an overview of the resulting corpus, which
is, at 4480 instances, the largest corpus of distin-
guishing descriptions developed to date.1 Consis-
tent with the common focus on initial reference in
visual scenes, we used visual stimuli containing a
small number of simple objects (cubes and balls) in
a 3D scene, similar to our much smaller GRE3D3
Corpus (Viethen and Dale, 2008), and elicited indi-
vidual descriptions in the absence of a complicating
preceding discourse. Additionally, we introduced
factors that allow the study of the use of spatial re-
lations in referring expressions by creating stimu-
lus scenes that encourage the use of relations be-
tween objects, but do not require them. Most ex-
isting REG algorithms that can make use spatial rela-
tions between objects only do so if no distinguishing
description can be found otherwise (Dale and Had-
dock, 1991; Gardent, 2002; Krahmer and Theune,
2002; van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2005; Kelleher
and Kruijff, 2006), often based on the argument that
mentioning two entities imposes a higher cognitive
load than referring to only one entity. We are inter-
ested in investigating in how far this behaviour cor-
responds to the human use of spatial relations in dis-
tinguishing descriptions, as well as testing a number
of concrete hypotheses about the factors that might
lead people to use spatial relations.
2 Stimulus Design
The stimulus scenes used for the GRE3D7 corpus
are three-dimensional scenes containing only sim-
ple geometric shapes, created in Google SketchUp.
Each stimulus scene contains seven objects; these
are grouped into three pairs of two and one single
object. The target object is always part of one of
the pairs and the second object of that pair is what
we call the landmark object in these scenes. We at-
tempted to place the target?landmark pair as close
to the centre of the scene as possible to encourage
the use of the target?s direct object properties and its
spatial relations to other objects, rather than its over-
all location in the scene, as in in the left. The other
two object pairs were placed slightly further back to

www.clt.mq.edu.au/research/projects/gre3d7.
13
the left and right of the target?landmark pair, and
the single object was always placed in the far right
or the far left of the scene. Objects were of one of
two types (ball or cube) and otherwise distinguish-
able by their size and colour. Each object could be
either large or small, and in each scene we used only
two colours. Figure 1 shows a close-up of one of
the scenes as presented to the subjects, and Figure 2
shows the complete set of stimulus scenes.
The design of the stimulus scenes was based on a
number of hypotheses about the factors that might
influence people?s use of spatial relations to the
landmark object. The two main hypotheses are con-
cerned with the influence of the landmark object?s
size on its visual salience and the likelihood of the
target?landmark relation being used in a referring
expression:
Hypothesis 1: A large landmark is more salient
than a small one because it occupies more of
the visual space of a scene. Therefore, a large
landmark is more likely to be mentioned in a re-
ferring expression via its spatial relation to the
target referent than a small landmark.
Hypothesis 2: A landmark that shares its size with
a number of other objects in the scene is less
salient than one that is unique in size. There-
fore, a landmark with unique size is more likely
to be mentioned in a referring expression via
its spatial relation to the target referent than a
landmark with a common size.
Hypotheses 1 and 2 are concerned with the land-
mark?s overall salience in the scene, or what is usu-
ally called bottom-up salience in the literature on
visual attention (cf., Yantis, 1998). A second con-
sideration that might influence the use of relations is
the top-down salience of the target and landmark ob-
jects, as determined by the task the participants are
performing. At the time when the landmark?s visual
salience is taken into account, the participants are
focusing their attention on the target object. As the
landmark is the closest object to the target, it is likely
that the difference or similarity between these two
objects plays a particularly important role in the de-
cision whether to include the relation between them
or not. Two conflicting hypotheses can be formu-
lated here:
Hypothesis 3: The difference between the land-
mark and the target object impacts on the visual
salience of the landmark because it impacts on
the landmark?s overall uniqueness in the scene.
Therefore, a landmark that is visually different
from the target is more likely to be included in a
referring expression than one that looks similar
to the target.
Hypothesis 4: The more similar the landmark and
target objects are, the more they appear as one
visual unit rather than two separate objects. If
they are perceived and conceptualised as a vi-
sual unit, they are more likely to be mentioned
together. Therefore, the more similar the land-
mark is to the target, the more likely it is to be
included in a referring expression.
The fifth hypothesis that this experiment is designed
to test concerns the preference that participants in
psycholinguistic work have shown for vertical rela-
tions over horizontal ones (Lyons, 1977; Bryant et
al., 1992; Gapp, 1995; Bryant et al, 2000; Landau,
2003; Arts, 2004; Tenbrink, 2004). To make sure
that the landmark is never obscured by the target ob-
ject, we use lateral relations rather than frontal ones
in this experiment.
Hypothesis 5: A target placed on top of a landmark
object is more likely to be described in terms
of its spatial relation to the landmark than a tar-
get that is sitting directly adjacent to the left or
right of the landmark.
We report the results of putting these five hypothe-
ses to the test in Section 5.4. To be able to per-
form these tests systematically, the experiment was
designed as a 2?2?2?2?2 grid with the following
five variables:
? LM Size: the landmark is either large or small.
[Large/Small]
? LM Size Rare: the size of the landmark is ei-
ther a common size in the scene, or it is as
rare as possible, and possibly unique. If it is
common and the landmark is large, it shares
its size with two of the objects; if it is small,
with three. These numbers are not the same
because in each scene in which the landmark
14
size was common, three objects were large
and four small. In +LM Size Rare scenes that
are also +TG Size = LM Size, the landmark
shares size only with the target. Only if the
scene is ?TG Size = LM Size can the land-
mark?s size be truly unique in the scene. [+/?]
? TG Size = LM Size: target and landmark are
either the same size or different. [+/?]
? TG Col = LM Col: The target and the land-
mark are either of the same colour or different
in colour. [+/?]
? Relation: The relation between the target and
the landmark is either vertical (the target is on
top of the landmark) or lateral, in which case
the target is placed directly to the left or right
of the landmark. [Vertical/Lateral]
This resulted in 32 experimental conditions. We cre-
ated one stimulus scene for each of these conditions.
We then split the stimuli into two trial sets along the
factor TG Size = LM Size, so that this variable be-
came a between-participant factor, while the other
four are within-participant factors.
We followed a number of other criteria for the de-
sign of the stimulus scenes to ensure maximum ex-
perimental control over the factors influencing the
content of the referring expressions provided by our
participants:
Target uniqueness: The target was always distin-
guishable in terms of its inherent properties alone,2
which means that the relation to the landmark or
other external properties, such as the location in the
scene, were never necessary to fully distinguish the
target from all other objects in the scene.
Landmark uniqueness: As the target, the land-
mark was always distinguishable in terms of its in-
herent properties alone.
Colour balance: Each scene followed one of two
colour schemes: either blue?green or red?yellow.
The colour schemes were distributed in a balanced
way across the five experimental variables, so that
2We use the term inherent property to refer to any property
of an entity which that entity has independent of the context in
which it appears.
half of the scenes in each condition were blue?green
and the other half red?yellow. The colour scheme
was not expected to have an influence on the con-
tent of the referring expressions people produced. In
each scene, four objects were of one colour of the
colour scheme for this scene and three had the other
colour.
Relation balance: The relation between the target
and the object was never unique. One of the two
other object pairs in each scene was arranged in the
same spatial relation as the target?landmark pair and
the third pair had the other relation. However, the
objects in the pair with the same relation were never
of the same types as the target and landmark, so that
a description containing the type of the target, a re-
lation to the landmark and the type of the landmark
was always fully distinguishing.
Constant landmark and target types: The land-
mark was always a cube, in order to avoid scenes
where the target would have to be balanced on top
of a ball, which might look unnatural. The target
was always a ball to make sure that the similarity in
type between these two objects was always constant.
No obscured objects: The objects were placed in
the scenes in such a way that no object occluded any
other. In particular, as mentioned above, there were
no frontal relations within the object pairs, to avoid
larger objects obscuring smaller ones completely or
to a large degree.
Figure 2 shows the 2?2?2?2?2 grid of the 32
stimuli scenes. Scenes 1?16, shown on a green back-
ground, constitute Trial Set 1, and Scenes 17?32,
shown on a blue background, constitute Trial Set 2.
3 Procedure and Participants
The data gathering experiment was designed as a
self-paced on-line language production study. Par-
ticipants visited a website, where they first saw an
introductory page with a set of simple instructions
and a sample stimulus scene. Each participant was
assigned one of the two trial sets containing 16 stim-
ulus scenes each. After the instruction page, the
scenes were presented consecutively in an order that
was randomised for every participant. Below each
scene, the participants had to complete the sentence

Please pick up the . . . in a text box before click-
ing a button labelled ?DONE? to move on to the next
scene, as shown in Figure 1. The task was to de-
scribe the target referent in the scene (marked by a
grey arrow) in a way that would enable a friend look-
ing at the same scene to pick it out from the other
objects. To encourage the use of fully distinguish-
ing descriptions, participants were told that they had
only one chance at describing the object.
Before each of the 16 stimulus scenes, the partic-
ipants were shown a filler scene, which means each
participant had to describe 32 scenes in total. The
main motivation for using filler scenes was to min-
imise the decline in relation use over time, which
might otherwise happen if participants realised that
relations were never necessary.
The filler scenes were also designed with the in-
tention of making the experiment less monotonous,
and to stop participants from noticing the strict de-
sign features of the stimulus scenes. In particular,
each participant saw: four scenes with twelve ob-
jects in all four colours, as opposed to the two-colour
schemes; two scenes containing only three objects;
and ten further filler scenes which intentionally vio-
lated the above design criteria. The filler scenes for
each participant were chosen such that in eleven or
twelve scenes the target was a cube instead of a ball,
in two scenes the landmark was a ball, in four scenes
there was no obvious landmark close to the target, in
eight scenes the target was unique (i.e. it could not
be described by its inherent visual properties alone),
in nine or ten scenes the target and landmark shared
type, and in two or three scenes target and landmark
were of the same size; for participants who saw Trial
Set 2 all stimulus scenes also had a target and land-
mark of the same size.
The sequence of the 32 scenes that were shown to
a particular participant was determined by the fol-
lowing three steps:
1. Pick the opposite trial set to the one that the last
participant saw and randomise its order.
2. Pick the set of 16 filler scenes to be shown to
this participant and randomise their order.
3. Interleave the two sets so that each stimulus
scene is preceded by one filler scene.
After having described all 32 scenes in the trial,
participants were asked to complete an exit ques-
tionnaire, which gave them the option of having
their data discarded and asked for their opinion on
whether the task became easier over time and any
other comments they might wish to make.
The experiment was started by 318 native English
speakers, of which 294 completed all 32 scenes.
They were recruited by word of mouth via a widely-
circulated call for participation and two electronic
mailing lists.3 The participants were predominantly
in their twenties or thirties and mostly university-
educated. A slight majority (54%) were female.
None of them reported colour-blindness. Each re-
ferring expression in the corpus is tagged with an
anonymous ID number linking it to some simple de-
mographic data about the contributing participant,
including gender, age, type of English spoken, and
field of education.

4 Data Filtering and Annotation
Of the 294 participants who completed the experi-
ment, five consistently used only type, although the
target?s type was never fully distinguishing in any of
the stimulus scenes. For example, these participants
described the target in Figure 1 simply as ball, which
does not distinguish it from the two other balls in
the scene. We discarded the data of these partici-
pants under the assumption that they had not under-
stood the instruction that their descriptions were to
uniquely identify the target. Two participants? data
were discarded because they provided text that was
unrelated to the displayed scenes. Of the remaining
287 participants, 140 saw Trial Set 2 and 147 saw
Trial Set 1. The data from seven randomly-chosen
participants from Trial Set 1 were discarded to bal-
ance the corpus in terms of the between-participant
feature TG Size = LM Size. Each person described
the 16 scenes contained in either of the trial sets, re-
sulting in a corpus of 4480 descriptions in total, with
140 descriptions for each scene. No other corpus of
referring expressions contains as many descriptions
for each referential scenario from different speak-
ers, which makes this corpus ideal for the study of
speaker-specific preferences and non-deterministic
choices in content selection.
Only five of the 4480 descriptions used the ternary
spatial relation between, and one description men-
tioned two distinct spatial relations, one to the in-
tended landmark and one to another object. The re-
lation to the third object in these six descriptions was
disregarded in the analysis presented here.
In order to be able to analyse the semantic content
of the referring expressions, we semi-automatically
annotated the inherent attributes and relations con-
tained in each of them. The attributes annotated are
? type[ball, cube]
? colour[blue, green, red, yellow]
? size[large, small]
? location[right, left, front, top, bottom, centre]
? relation[horizontal, vertical]
Each attribute (except relation) is prefixed by either
tg or lm to mark which of the objects it pertains
to. For example, tg size indicates that the size of the
target was mentioned.

In the 83 descriptions containing comparatives,
such as Example (1), we ignored the second object
that the target was being compared to. In all of these
cases, the target?s colour and type were also men-
tioned, which means that in the context of the sim-
ple scenes at stake here, Example (1) is semantically
equivalent to Example (2).

(2) the small red ball
The question of how to deal with the relative na-
ture of size is a separate, non-trivial, issue; see (van
Deemter, 2000; van Deemter, 2006).
5 Analysis of the GRE3D7 Corpus
In this section we examine the content of the 4480
descriptions that make up the GRE3D7 Corpus. We
first give an overview of the use of the non-relational
attributes, and then proceed to investigate the hy-
potheses from Section 2 regarding the use of spatial
relations.
The target object?s type was mentioned in each
description in the corpus, and each relational de-
scription contained the landmark object?s type. Ta-
ble 1 shows the number of descriptions containing
each of the other attributes.
5.1 Sparing Use of location
Only 81 descriptions (1.8%) made reference to the
target referent?s location in the scene, as in Exam-
ple (3); and of the 600 relational descriptions in the
corpus, only ten (1.7%) contained the location of the
landmark, as in Example (4).
(3) the large yellow ball on the left [Scene 9]
17
(4) the small ball next to the large cube on the left
hand side [Scene 6]
There were no descriptions containing both
tg location and lm location. This might indicate
that participants who used a relation were more
likely to conceptualise the target?landmark pair
as a unit with just one location rather than as two
individual entities. However, the corpus was not
designed to investigate this issue and the numbers
for use of location are too low to draw any definite
conclusions.
5.2 Abundant Use of colour
Colour was used in the vast majority of descriptions:
98.7% of all descriptions included the colour of the
target object and 86.8% of the relational descriptions
included the colour of the landmark object. A high
number of descriptions containing colour could be
expected, as colour was part of the shortest possi-
ble minimal description not containing any spatial
information (we call this the inherent MD of the tar-
get) for 20 of the 32 scenes (all but Scenes 17?24
and 29?32). However, the fact that colour was also
included in the majority of the descriptions contain-
ing spatial information, in the form of a relation or
the location, confirms previous findings to the effect
that colour is often included in descriptions redun-
dantly (Belke and Meyer, 2002; Arts, 2004; Gatt,
2007).
5.3 Utilitarian Use of size
The target?s size was mentioned in 57.8% of all de-
scriptions, and the landmark?s size in 54.8% of the
relational descriptions.
Considering that tg size was part of the inherent
MD in only 12 of 32 scenes (37.5%) of the stimu-
lus scenes (Scenes 2, 4, 9?12, 18, 20 and 25?28),
57.8% seems like a high proportion of descriptions
to be using this attribute. The use of tg size for
scenes where it was part of the inherent MD was at
90.2% very high, but this only accounts for just un-
der 60% of all the descriptions that contained this
attribute. The remaining 40% of descriptions con-
taining tg size were given for scenes in which this
attribute was not strictly necessary to distinguish the
target from the other objects.
Findings from eye-tracking experiments in psy-
cholinguistics have shown that size is rarely used in
situations where it adds no discriminatory power to
the referring expression at all, and that it is more
likely to be used to compare to or distinguish from
other objects of the same type, while the same is
not true for colour (Sedivy, 2003; Brown-Schmidt
and Tanenhaus, 2006). Let us therefore consider in
particular the scenes where tg size was not part of
the inherent MD, and look at the differing utility of
tg size in these scenes: 12 of the 20 scenes where
tg size was not necessarily part of the inherent MD
(Scenes 1, 3, 5?8, 13?16, 17, 19, 21?24 and 29?
32) nonetheless contained another object that shared
the target?s type (ball) but not its size (Scenes 1, 3,
17, 19, 21?24 and 29?32). In these scenes, tg size
remains a useful attribute to use, even if tg type is
also included.
Based on the psycholinguistic findings mentioned
above, one might expect that the use of tg size is
higher for these scenes because here it helps distin-
guish from another object of the same type rather
than only from objects of a different type. This hy-
pothesis is supported by the data: tg size was used
in 45.6% of the descriptions for scenes where it was
not part of the inherent MD but there was another ob-
ject of same type and different size as the target. For
scenes where tg size could only distinguish the tar-
get from objects of the other type, it was only used
in 27.3% of cases (?2=94.97, df=1, p.01).
5.4 The Use of Spatial Relations
600 of the 4480 descriptions in the GRE3D7 Cor-
pus (13.4%) mentioned a spatial relation. This was
despite the fact that spatial information was not re-
quired in any of the stimulus scenes. Most existing
approaches to spatial relations in REG would there-
fore never include a relation for any of the stimuli.
In this section, we examine the circumstances un-
der which the participants of the GRE3D7 data col-
lection experiment used the spatial relation between
the target object and the intended landmark. We
will first examine participant-dependent and tempo-
ral factors and then move on to analyse the impact
that the design features of the scenes, described in
Section 2, had on the use of relations.
General Factors
We first checked for broad participant-dependent
preferences for or against using relations in the
18
GRE3D7 Corpus. The behaviour of participants
who use an exclusive strategy of either always or
never including a relation in their referring expres-
sions would be easy to predict in a computational
model and does not contribute to any variation
across different scenes. In order to gain a clear un-
derstanding of this variation, we will concentrate on
the data from participants who varied their use of
relations between scenes.
Half of the participants (50.3%) adopted an ex-
clusive strategy regarding the use of relations. How-
ever, the split between the two exclusive strategies
was very uneven: 135 participants never used a spa-
tial relation and only six used a spatial relation for
all 16 stimulus scenes they saw. In the following, we
analyse the data from the 139 participants who used
a relation for some scenes but not for others. On av-
erage, these participants used a relation in 22.7% of
their descriptions.
In (Viethen and Dale, 2008), we observed a ?lazi-
ness effect? whereby participants? use of relations
decreased over the course of the experiment. A num-
ber of participants mentioned in the exit interview
that they noticed over time that relations were never
required and stopped using them. Such a conscious,
or semi-conscious, adjustment masks people?s nat-
ural propensity to use a relation in a reference situ-
ation where they come anew at the task rather than
describing one object after another.
In the GRE3D7 collection experiment, each par-
ticipant saw eight filler scenes in which spatial rela-
tions were required to distinguish the target. These
filler scenes were included to stop participants from
consciously noticing that relations were never re-
quired in the stimulus scenes. We hoped that this
would reduce the laziness effect and thereby pro-
duce results that better approximate people?s natu-
ral tendency to use a relation. However, Figure 3
shows that, despite the use of these filler scenes, the
use of relations declined over the course of the ex-
periment. Participants who did not follow an exclu-
sive strategy clearly used more relations for scenes
they saw early on than for those they saw towards
the end. We divided the data set into quartiles in
order to test the statistical significance of this de-
cline. The falling trend was statistically significant
at p.01 (?2=55.42, df=3). However, any tem-
poral effect in GRE3D7 should not interfere with

Figure 4: Effect of design variables on use of relation
between-stimulus effects, as the stimuli were pre-
sented in a randomised order.
Influence of Scene Features on Relation Use
We will now turn to the examination of Hypothe-
ses 1?5 from Section 2. Figure 4 shows the impact
that each of the five variables of the scene design had
on the use of relations. The left (green) columns rep-
resent the conditions for which we expected fewer
relations to be used, and the right (yellow) columns
represent the conditions for which we expected a
higher use of relations, according to Hypotheses 1?
3 and 5. Hypothesis 4 expected the reverse results
for TG Size = LM Size and TG Col = LM Col. All
factors except LM Size and TG Size = LM Size had
a statistically significant effect.
Hypotheses 1 and 2, which expected a large
landmark with a rare or unique size to be more
salient and therefore more likely to be used, are
not supported by the data here. LM Size did not
have a reliable effect (?2=0.16, df=1, p>.6) and
19
LM Size Rare shows the opposite effect of the one
we expected: a relation to a landmark with a com-
mon size is significantly more likely to be included
in a referring expression than one to a landmark with
a rare or unique size (?2=56.19, df=1, p.01). On
closer inspection, this is likely to be due to a fac-
tor that was not explicitly tested or controlled for in
this experiment: the length of the inherent MD of the
target referent. In most scenes with a common land-
mark size (all but Scenes 1, 3, 17, and 19), all three
inherent attributes (size, colour and type) are neces-
sary to distinguish the target from the other objects
without using locational information. In all scenes
where the landmark?s size is rare or unique, colour
and type suffice. In other words, targets which are
harder to describe using inherent visual properties
only are more likely to be described by a relation to
a nearby landmark.
Hypotheses 3 and 4 predicted two mutually ex-
clusive scenarios based on the assumption that the
similarity between the target and the landmark ob-
ject is of special importance, as the participant?s vi-
sual attention is likely to be focussed on these two
objects. Hypothesis 3 predicted that a visual dif-
ference between the landmark and the target would
increase the landmark?s salience and therefore the
use of the spatial relation to this landmark. Hypoth-
esis 4 predicted that high visual similarity between
target and landmark might result in these two ob-
jects being conceptualised as a unit, which would
increase the likelihood of both objects being men-
tioned. The target and landmark object were al-
ways of different types, so their similarity depends
on their size and their colour, captured in the vari-
ables TG Size = LM Size and TG Col = LM Col.
TG Size = LM Size did not show a significant ef-
fect on the use of relations (?2=2.29, df=1, p>.1).
The effect of TG Col = LM Col favours Hypothe-
sis 4, as a landmark of the same colour as the target
is more likely to be included in the target?s descrip-
tion than one that has a different colour from the tar-
get (?2=11.18, df=1, p0.01).
The variable Relation had the expected effect: A
vertical relation is significantly more likely to be
used than a lateral one (?2=69.00, df=1, p.01).
This confirms Hypotheses 5.
6 Conclusion
We have described the GRE3D7 Corpus, a collec-
tion of human-produced distinguishing descriptions
that is considerably larger than any other existing
corpus. The collection also uses scenes that are a
degree more complex than those found in existing
corpora; these are based on a principled design in
order to provide a measure of control over what can
be learned from the data. In this paper we have de-
scribed the details of the collection experiment and
have presented an analysis of the impacts that the de-
sign variables had on the content of the resulting de-
scriptions. The main outcomes of this analysis are:
Colour is used in 99% of all descriptions. It is
also used redundantly in 87% of all relational de-
scriptions. This is in accordance with findings in
other corpora and psycholinguistic studies.
Size is used when it is distinguishing. The size
of the target referent was much more likely to be
included when it was useful in distinguishing from
another object in the scene, especially those of the
same type.
Just over half of the participants follow an ex-
clusive strategy for the use of relations. A large
proportion of participants (135) opted to never use
a relation, while a much smaller number of people
(6) used a relation in all of their descriptions. The
remaining 139 participants are responsible for the
variation in the data, as they used a relation to de-
scribe the target in some but not all scenes.
The target?landmark relation is used more often
if it is vertical than if it is lateral. This confirms
previous psycholinguistic findings showing that hu-
mans prefer vertical relations and prepositions over
horizontal, and in particular lateral, ones.
If a landmark shares colour with the target it is
more likely to be used in a referring expression. This
lends support to the hypothesis that visual similar-
ity between target and landmark increases the likeli-
hood of the relation between them being used.
The data thus sheds additional light on the nature
of human-produced descriptions of objects in visual
scenes. It also, of course, provides a rich corpus of
data that can be readily used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of computational algorithms for the genera-
tion of referring expressions.
