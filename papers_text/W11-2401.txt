Abstract
Reading comprehension activities are an au-
thentic task including a rich, language-based
context, which makes them an interesting real-
life challenge for research into automatic con-
tent analysis. For textual entailment research,
content assessment of reading comprehension
exercises provides an interesting opportunity
for extrinsic, real-purpose evaluation, which
also supports the integration of context and
task information into the analysis.
In this paper, we discuss the first results for
content assessment of reading comprehension
activities for German and present results which
are competitive with the current state of the
art for English. Diving deeper into the results,
we provide an analysis in terms of the differ-
ent question types and the ways in which the
information asked for is encoded in the text.
We then turn to analyzing the role of the ques-
tion and argue that the surface-based account
of information that is given in the question
should be replaced with a more sophisticated,
linguistically informed analysis of the informa-
tion structuring of the answer in the context of
the question that it is a response to.
1 Introduction
Reading comprehension exercises offer a real-life
challenge for the automatic analysis of meaning.
Given a text and a question, the content assessment
task is to determine whether the answer given to a
reading comprehension question actually answers
the question or not. Such reading comprehension
exercises are a common activity in foreign language
teaching, making it possible to use activities which
are authentic and for which the language teachers
provide the gold standard judgements.
Apart from the availability of authentic exercises
and independently motivated gold standard judge-
ments, there are two further reasons for putting read-
ing comprehension tasks into the spotlight for au-
tomatic meaning analysis. Firstly, such activities
include a text as an explicit context on the basis of
which the questions are asked. Secondly, answers to
reading comprehension questions in foreign language
teaching typically are between a couple of words and
several sentences in length ? too short to rely purely
on the distribution of lexical material (as, e.g., in
LSA, Landauer et al, 1998). The answers also ex-
hibit a significant variation in form, including a high
number of form errors, which makes it necessary to
develop an approach which is robust enough to de-
termine meaning correspondences in the presence of
errors yet flexible enough to support the rich vari-
ation in form which language offers for expressing
related meanings.
There is relatively little research on content assess-
ment for reading comprehension tasks and it so far
has focused exclusively on English, including both
reading comprehension questions answered by na-
tive speakers (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003; Nielsen
et al, 2009) and by language learners (Bailey and
Meurers, 2008). The task is related to the increas-
ingly popular strand of research on Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment (RTE, Dagan et al, 2009) and the
Answer Validation Exercise (AVE, Rodrigo et al,
2009), which both have also generally targeted En-
glish.
1
The RTE challenge abstracts away from concrete
tasks to emphasize the generic semantic inference
component and it has significantly advanced the field
under this perspective. At the same time, an inves-
tigation of the role of the context under which an
inference holds requires concrete tasks, for which
content assessment of reading comprehension tasks
seems particularly well-suited. Borrowing the ter-
minology Spa?rck Jones (2007) coined in the context
of evaluating automatic summarization systems, one
can say that we pursue an extrinsic, full-purpose eval-
uation of aspects of textual inference. The content
assessment task provides two distinct opportunities
to investigate textual entailment: On the one hand,
one can conceptualize it as a textual inference task
of deciding whether a given text T supports a partic-
ular student answer H . On the other hand, if target
answers are provided by the teachers, the task can be
seen as a special bi-directional case of textual entail-
ment, namely a paraphrase recognition task compar-
ing the student answers to the teacher target answers.
In this paper, we focus on this second approach.
The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand,
we want to present the first content assessment ap-
proach for reading comprehension activities focusing
on German. In the discussion of the results, we will
highlight the impact of the question types and the
way in which the information asked for is encoded
in the text. On the other hand, we want to discuss
the importance of the explicit language-based context
and how an analysis of the question and the way a
text encodes the information being asked for can help
advance research on automatic content assessment.
Overall, the paper can be understood as a step in the
long-term agenda of exploring the role and impact
of the task and the context on the automatic analysis
and interpretation of natural language.
2 Data
The experiments described in this paper are based
on the Corpus of Reading comprehension Exercises
in German (CREG), which is being collected in col-
laboration with two large German programs in the
US, at Kansas University (Prof. Nina Vyatkina) and
at The Ohio State University (Prof. Kathryn Corl).
German teachers are using the WEb-based Learner
COrpus MachinE (WELCOME, Meurers et al, 2010)
interface to enter the regular, authentic reading com-
prehension exercises used in class, which are thereby
submitted to a central corpus repository. These exer-
cises consist of texts, questions, target answers, and
corresponding student answers. Each student answer
is transcribed from the hand-written submission by
two independent annotators. These two annotators
then assess the contents of the answers with respect
to meaning: Did the student provide a meaningful
answer to the question? In this binary content as-
sessment one thus distinguishes answers which are
appropriate from those which are inappropriate in
terms of meaning, independent of whether the an-
swers are grammatically well-formed or not.
From the collected data, we selected an even dis-
tribution of unique appropriate and inappropriate stu-
dent answers in order to obtain a 50% random base-
line for our system. Table 1 lists how many questions,
target answers and student answers each of the two
data sets contains. The data used for this paper is

3 Approach
Our work builds on the English content assessment
approach of Bailey and Meurers (2008), who pro-
pose a Content Assessment Module (CAM) which
automatically compares student answers to target re-
sponses specified by foreign language teachers. As a
first step we reimplemented this approach for English
in a system we called CoMiC (Comparing Mean-
ing in Context) which is discussed in Meurers et al
(2011). This reimplementation was then adapted
for German, resulting in the CoMiC-DE system pre-
sented in this paper.
The comparison of student answers and target an-
swer is based on an alignment of tokens, chunks, and
1http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

dependency triples between the student and the target
answer at different levels of abstraction. Figure 1
shows a simple example including token-level and
chunk-level alignments between the target answer
(TA) and the student answer (SA).
Figure 1: Basic example for alignment approach
As the example suggests, it is not sufficient to align
only identical surface forms given that significant lex-
ical and syntactic variation occurs in typical student
answers. Alignment thus is supported at different
levels of abstraction. For example, the token units
are enriched with lemma and synonym information
using standard NLP tools. Table 2 gives an overview
of which NLP tools we use for which task in CoMiC-
DE. In general, the components are very similar to
those used in the English system, with different sta-
tistical models and parameters where necessary.

Table 2: NLP tools used in the German system
Integrating the multitude of units and their rep-
resentations at different levels of abstraction poses
significant challenges to the system architecture.
Among other requirements, different representations
of the same surface string need to be stored without
interfering with each other, and various NLP tools
need to collaborate in order to produce the final rich
data structures used for answer comparison. To meet
these requirements, we chose to implement our sys-
tem in the Unstructured Information Management
Architecture (UIMA, cf. Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).
UIMA allows automatic analysis modules to access
layers of stand-off annotation, and hence allows for
the coexistence of both independent and interdepen-
dent annotations, unlike traditional pipeline-style ar-
chitectures, where the output of each component re-
places its input. The use of UIMA in recent success-
ful large-scale projects such as DeepQA (Ferrucci
et al, 2010) confirms that UIMA is a good candi-
date for complex language processing tasks where
integration of various representations is required.
In order to determine the global alignment con-
figuration, all local alignment options are computed
for every mappable unit. These local candidates are
then used as input for the Traditional Marriage Al-
gorithm (Gale and Shapley, 1962) which computes a
global alignment solution where each mappable unit
is aligned to at most one unit in the other response,
such as the one we saw in Figure 1.
On the basis of the resulting global alignment con-
figuration, the system performs the binary content
assessment by evaluating whether the meaning of the
learner and the target answer are sufficiently similar.
For this purpose, it extracts features which encode
the numbers and types of alignment and feeds them
to the memory-based classifier TiMBL (Daelemans
et al, 2007). The features used are listed in Table 3.

4 Content Assessment Experiment
4.1 Setup
We ran our content assessment experiment using
the two data sets introduced in section 2, one from
Kansas University and the other from The Ohio State
University. Both of these contain only records where
both annotators agreed on the binary assessment (ap-
propriate/inappropriate meaning). Each set is bal-
anced, i.e., they contain the same number of appro-
priate and inappropriate student answers.
In training and testing the TiMBL-based classi-
fier, we followed the methodology of Bailey (2008,
p. 240), where seven classifiers are trained using the
different available distance metrics (Overlap, Leven-
shtein, Numeric Overlap, Modified value difference,
Jeffrey divergence, Dot product, Cosine). Training
and testing was performed using the leave-one-out
scheme (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991) and for each
item the output of the seven classifiers was combined
via majority voting.
4.2 Results
The classification accuracy for both data sets is sum-
marized in Table 4. We report accuracy and the total
number of answers for each data set.
KU data set OSU data set
# of answers 610 422
Accuracy 84.6% 84.6%
Table 4: Classification accuracy for the two data sets
The 84.6% accuracy figure obtained for both data
sets shows that CoMiC-DE is quite successful in
performing content assessment for the German data
collected so far, a result which is competitive with
the one for English obtained by Bailey and Meurers
(2008), who report an accuracy of 78% for the binary
assessment task on a balanced English data set.
A remarkable feature is the identity of the scores
for the two data sets, considering that the data was
collected at different universities from different stu-
dents in different classes run by different teachers.
Moreover, there was no overlap in exercise material
between the two data sets. This indicates that there
is some characteristic uniformity of the learner re-
sponses in authentic reading comprehension tasks,
suggesting that the course setting and task type effec-
tively constrains the degree of syntactic and lexical
variation in the student answers. This includes the
stage of the learners in this foreign language teaching
setting, which limits their exposure to linguistic con-
structions, as well as the presence of explicit reading
texts that the questions are about, which may lead
learners to use the lexical material provided instead
of rephrasing content in other words. We intend to ex-
plore these issues in our future work to obtain a more
explicit picture of the contextual and task properties
involved.
Another aspect which should be kept in mind is
that the scores we obtained are based on a data set
for which the two human annotators had agreed on
their assessment. We expect automatic classification
results to degrade given more controversial data about
which human annotators disagree, especially since
such data will presumably contain more ambiguous
cues, giving rise to multiple interpretations.
4.3 Evaluation by question type
The overall results include many different question
types which pose different kinds of challenges to
our system. To develop an understanding of those
challenges, we performed a more fine-grained evalu-
ation by question types. To distinguish relevant sub-
cases, we applied the question classification scheme
introduced by Day and Park (2005). This scheme is
more suitable here than other common answer-typing
schemata such as the one in Li and Roth (2002),
which tend to focus on questions asking for factual
knowledge.
Day and Park (2005) distinguish five different
question forms: yes/no (question to be answered
with either yes or no), alternative (two or more
yes/no questions connected with or), true or false
(a statement to be classified as true or false),
who/what/when/where/how/why (wh-question con-
taining the respective question word), and multiple
choice (choice between several answers presented
with a question, of any other question type). In addi-
tion, they introduce a second dimension distinguish-
ing the types of comprehension involved, i.e., how
the information asked for by the question can be ob-
tained from the text: literal (questions that can be an-
swered directly and explicitly from the text), reorga-
nization (questions where information from various
4
parts of the text must be combined), inference (ques-
tions where literal information and world knowledge
must be combined), prediction (prediction of how
a story might continue), evaluation (comprehensive
judgement about aspects of the text) and personal
response (personal opinion or feelings about the text
or the subject).
Out of the five different forms of question, our
data contains questions of all forms except for the
multiple choice category and the true or false cate-
gory given that we are explicitly targeting free text
responses. To obtain a more detailed picture of the
wh-question category, we decided to split that cat-
egory into its respective wh-words and added one
more category to it, for which. Also, we added the
type ?several? for questions which contain more than
one question presented to the student at a time. Of the
six comprehension types, our data contained literal,
reorganization and inference questions.
Table 5 reports the accuracy results by question
forms and comprehension types for the combined
OSU and KU data set. The counts encode the num-
ber of student answers for which accuracy is reported
(micro-averages). The numbers in brackets specify
the number of distinct questions and the correspond-
ing accuracy measures are computed by grouping
answers by their question (macro-averages). Com-
paring answer-based (micro-average) accuracy with
question-based (macro-average) accuracy allows us
to see whether the results for questions with a high
number of answers outweigh questions with a small
number of answers. In general the micro- and macro-
averages reported are very similar and the overall
accuracy is the same (84.6%). Overall, the results
thus do not seem to be biased towards a specific, fre-
quently answered question instance. Where larger
differences between micro- and macro-averages do
arise, as for alternative, when, and where questions,
these are cases with few overall instances in the data
set, cautioning us against overinterpreting results for
such small subsets. The 4.2% gap for the relatively
frequent ?several? question type underlines the het-
erogeneous nature of this class, which may warrant
more specific subclasses in the future.
Overall, the accuracy of content assessment for
wh-questions that can be answered with a concrete
piece of information from the text are highest, with
92.6% for ?which? questions, and results in the upper
80s for five other wh-questions. Interestingly, ?who?
questions fare comparatively badly, pointing to a rel-
atively high variability in the expression of subjects,
which would warrant the integration of a dedicated
approach to coreference resolution. Such a direct so-
lution is not available for ?why? questions, which at
79.3% is the worst wh-question type. The high vari-
ability of those answers is rooted in the fact that they
ask for a cause or reason, which can be expressed in
a multitude of ways, especially for comprehension
types involving inferences or reorganization of the
information given in the text.
This drop between comprehension types, from lit-
eral (86.0%) to inference (81.5%) and reorganization
(78.0%), can also be observed throughout and is ex-
pected given that the CoMiC-DE system makes use
of surface-based alignments where it can find them.
For the system to improve on the non-literal com-
prehension types, features encoding a richer set of
abstractions (e.g., to capture distributional similarity
at the chunk level or global linguistic phenomena
such as negation) need to be introduced.
Just as in the discussion of the micro- and macro-
averages above, the ?several? question type again
rears its ugly heads in terms of a low overall accuracy
(77.7%). This supports the conclusion that it requires
a dedicated approach. Based on an analysis of the
nature and sequence of the component questions, in
future work we plan to determine how such combi-
nations constrain the space of variation in acceptable
answers.
Finally, while there are few instances for the ?al-
ternative? question type, the fact that it resulted in
the lowest accuracy (57.1%) warrants some attention.
The analysis indeed revealed a general issue, which
is discussed in the next section.
5 From eliminating repeated elements to
analyzing information structure
Bailey (2008, sec. 5.3.12) observed that answers fre-
quently repeat words given in the question. In her cor-
pus example (1), the first answer repeats ?the moral
question raised by the Clinton incident? from the
question, whereas the second one reformulates this
given material. But both sentences essentially answer
the question in the same way.2

(1) What was the major moral question raised by
the Clinton incident?
a. The moral question raised by the Clinton
incident was whether a politician?s person
life is relevant to their job performance.
b. A basic question for the media is whether
a politician?s personal life is relevant to his
or her performance in the job.
The issue arising from the occurrence of such
given material for a content assessment approach
based on alignment is that all alignments are counted,
yet those for given material do not actually con-
tribute to answering the question, as illustrated by
the (non)answer containing only given material ?The
moral question raised by the Clinton incident was
whatever.? Bailey (2008) concludes that an answer
should not be rewarded (or punished) for repeating
material that is given in the question and her imple-
mentation thus removes all words from the answers
which are given in the question.
While such an approach successfully eliminates
any contribution from these given words, it has the un-
fortunate consequence that any NLP processes requir-
ing well-formed complete sentences (such as, e.g.,
dependency parsers) perform poorly on sentences
from which the given words have been removed. In
our reimplementation of the approach, we therefore
kept the sentences as such intact and instead made
sition failure arising for this authentic reading comprehension
question ? as far as we see, there was no ?major moral question
raised by the Clinton incident?.
use of the UIMA architecture to add a givenness
annotation to those words of the answer which are
repeated from the question. Such given tokens and
any representations derived from them are ignored
when the local alignment possibilities are computed.
While successfully replicating the givenness filter
of Bailey (2008) without the negative consequences
on other NLP analysis, targeting given words in this
way is problematic, which becomes particularly ap-
parent when considering examples for the ?alterna-
tive? question type. In this question type, exemplified
in Figure 2 by an example from the KU data set, the
answer has to select one of the options from an ex-
plicitly given set of alternatives.

?Is the flat in a new building or in an old building??

Figure 2: ?Alternative? question with answers consisting
entirely of given words, resulting in no alignments.
The question asks whether the apartment is in a
new or in an old building, and both alternatives are
explicitly given in the question. The student picked
the same alternative as the one that was selected in
the target answer. Indeed, the two answers are iden-
tical, but the givenness filter excludes all material
from alignment and hence the content assessment
6
classification fails to identify the student answer as
appropriate. This clearly is incorrect and essentially
constitutes an opportunity to rethink the givenness
filter.
The givenness filter is based on a characterization
of the material we want to ignore, which was moti-
vated by the fact that it is easy to identify the material
that is repeated from the question. On the other hand,
if we analyze the reading comprehension questions
more closely, it becomes possible to connect this
issue to research in formal pragmatics which inves-
tigates the information structure (cf. Krifka, 2007)
imposed on a sentence in a discourse addressing
an explicit (or implicit) question under discussion
(Roberts, 1996). Instead of removing given elements
from an answer, under this perspective we want to
identify which part of an answer constitutes the so-
called focus answering the question.3
The advantage of linking our issue to the more
general investigation of information structure in lin-
guistics is readily apparent if we consider the signif-
icant complexity involved (cf., e.g., Bu?ring, 2007).
The issue of asking what constitutes the focus of a
sentence is distinct from asking what new informa-
tion is included in a sentence. New information can
be contained in the topic of a sentence. On the other
hand, the focus can also contain given information.
In (2a), for example, the focus of the answer is ?a
green apple?, even though apples are explicitly given
in the question and only the fact that a green one will
be bought is new.
(2) You?ve looked at the apples long enough now,
what do you want to buy?
a. I want to buy a green apple.
In some situations the focus can even consist en-
tirely of given information. This is one way of in-
terpreting what goes on in the case of the alternative
questions discussed at the end of the last section.
This question type explicitly mentions all alternatives
as part of the question, so that the focus of the an-
swer selecting one of those alternatives will typically
3The information structure literature naturally also provides
a more sophisticated account of givenness. For example, for
Schwarzschild (1999), givenness also occurs between hypernyms
and coreferent expressions, which would not be detected by the
simple surface-based givenness filter included in the current
CoMiC-DE.
consist entirely of given information.
As a next step we plan to build on the notion of
focus characterized in (a coherent subset of) the infor-
mation structure literature by developing an approach
which identifies the part of an answer which consti-
tutes the focus so that we can limit the alignment
procedure on which content assessment is based to
the focus of each answer.
6 Related Work
There are few systems targeting the short answer eval-
uation tasks. Most prominent among them is C-Rater
(Leacock and Chodorow, 2003), a short answer scor-
ing system for English meant for deployment in Intel-
ligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The authors highlight
the fact that C-Rater is not simply a string matching
program but instead uses more sophisticated NLP
such as shallow parsing and synonym matching. C-
Rater reportedly achieved an accuracy of 84% in two
different studies, which is remarkably similar to the
scores we report in this paper although clearly the
setting and target language differ from ours.
More recently in the ITS field, Nielsen et al (2009)
developed an approach focusing on recognizing tex-
tual entailment in student answers. To that end, a
corpus of questions and answers was manually an-
notated with word-word relations, so-called ?facets?,
which represent individual semantic propositions in a
particular answer. By learning how to recognize and
classify these facets in student answers, the system
is then able to give a more differentiated rating of
a student answer than ?right? or ?wrong?. We find
that this is a promising move in the fields of answer
scoring and textual entailment since it also breaks
down the complex entailment problem into a set of
sub-problems.
7 Conclusion
We presented CoMiC-DE, the first content assess-
ment system for German. For the data used in evalu-
ation so far, CoMiC-DE performs on a competitive
level when compared to previous work on English,
with accuracy at 84.6%. In addition to these results,
we make our reading comprehension corpus freely
available for research purposes in order to encourage
more work on content assessment and related areas.
In a more detailed evaluation by question and com-
7
prehension type, we gained new insights into how
question types influence the content assessment tasks.
Specifically, our system had more difficulty classify-
ing answers to ?why?-questions than other question
forms, which we attribute to the fact that causal re-
lations exhibit more form variation than other types
of answer material. Also, the comprehension type
?reorganization?, which requires the reader to collect
and combine information from different places in the
text, posed more problems to our system than the
?literal? type.
Related to the properties of questions, we showed
by example that simply marking given material on
a surface level is insufficient and a partitioning into
focused and background material is needed instead.
This is especially relevant for alternative questions,
where the exclusion of all given material renders the
alignment process useless. Future work will therefore
include focus detection in answers and its use in the
alignment process. For example, given a weighting
scheme for individual alignments, focused material
could be weighted more prominently in alignment in
order to reflect its importance in assessing the answer.
