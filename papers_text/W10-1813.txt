Abstract 
 
Language documentation is important as a tool 
for preservation of endangered languages and 
making data available to speakers and 
researchers of a language. A data base such as 
TypeCraft is important for typology studies both 
for well documented languages as well as little 
documented languages and is a valid tool for 
comparison of languages.  This requires that 
linguistic elements must be coded in a manner 
that allows comparability across widely varying 
language data. In this paper, I discuss how I 
have used the coding system in TypeCraft for 
the documentation of data from ? ?d? language, a 
language belonging to the Edoid group of the 
Benue-Congo subfamily of the Volta-Congo 
language family and spoken in Mid-Western 
Nigeria, West Africa. The study shows how 
syntactic, semantic and morphological 
properties of multi-verb constructions in ? ?d? 
(Benue-Congo) can be represented in a 
relational database. 
1. Introduction 
 
In this paper1, I show some ways in which I am 
using a shared methodology in my research on 
multi-verb constructions. My research is 
centered around the language ? ?d?, spoken in 
Mid-Western Nigeria, Ga and Akan (kwa), and 
the tool is the system TypeCraft, which has 
been developed in the ISK department, NTNU 
and first documented in Beermann and Prange 
(2006). 
??d? language belongs to the Niger-
Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-
Congo-Edoid language family.  The Ediod

comments on earlier versions of this paper. 
language family consists of 33 languages and 
19 of these languages have either very little 
documentation or no documentation available.  
Multi-verb constructions are constructions 
in which the verbs in series must function as 
independent verbs in simple constructions, 
with at least one shared argument and no 
marking of syntactic dependency. 
The paper shows how syntactic, semantic 
and morphological properties of multi-verb 
constructions in ??d? (Benue-Congo) can be 
represented in a relational database and the 
development of annotation standards that 
contribute to contrastive and typological 
research. The analysis is extended to multi-
verb constructions in the following languages 
of the Niger-Congo: Ga and Akan (Kwa).  
 
2. TypeCraft 
 
TypeCraft is a tool for typological analysis that 
allows for annotation, classification and search 
of data along different morphological, 
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic criteria. In 
annotating it is important to have annotation 
schemes that allow for typological and 
contrastive studies.  
In this paper I use an annotation scheme 
for verbal constructions currently being 
developed at NTNU and documented in Hellan 
and Dakubu (2009). Syntactic and semantic 
information about construction types are 
provided by templates composed by labels. 
The basic structural parts of a template are 
referred to as slots that are separated by 
hyphens. A template with a verbal head can 
consist of maximal 7 slots; (1) POS of the 
head, and diathesis information; (2) valence 
specification; (3) dependent specification; (4) 
participant roles; (5) aspect and aktionsart; (6) 
109
situation type; (7) provides a linking type 
between slot 6 situation type and the 
specifications in slots 2-4. Slots 1 and 2 are 
obligatorily filled, the others not. (cf. Hellan 
and Dakubu, 2009). At present annotation of 
the construction labels is manual and not 
incorporated into the TypeCraft. However 
TypeCraft provides a construction tier where 
this information can be incorporated. 
 
3. Sentence level and word level 
annotation 
 
TypeCraft provides a set of glosses for 
syntactic and semantic coding and a set of 
parameters along which sentences may be 
classified that allow for standardized 
annotation and cross linguistic comparison as 
illustrated in figure1:

3.1 Word level 
 
Word level annotation allows for analysis of 
predicates in terms of syntactic and semantic 
properties including information about the 
subcategorization properties and argument 
structure of predicates.  
 
Figure2: Text editor in TypeCraft 
  showing word level annotation   
                        
Type craft features 7 tiers that provide 
information at the word level as shown in the 
??d? example below.

Construction parameters: TransitiveVerb-

Construction labels: v-tr-suAg_obThincrem-

    PRON  V  CN

The construction labels are explained as 
follows: v in Slot1 in the example above states 
that the head of the construction is a verb. tr in 
Slot2 states that the verb is transitive, 
suAg_obThincrem in Slot 4 states that the NP 
that is the subject of the construction bears an 
agent theta role and the object an incremental 
theme theta role. Lastly slot 5 gives the 
information that the aktionsart of the 
construction is completed monodevelopment.

3.2 Sentence level 
TypeCraft provides a set of global tags at the 
sentence level that allows for classification in 
terms of syntactic and semantic automatically 
generated construction parameters such as 
constituent type, core constituent vs adjunct, 
transitivity, thematic roles, situation and aspect 
types, propositional types and polarity. Polarity 
is based on the assumption that States Of 
Affairs (SOA) comes in pairs: positive and 
negative. Figure 3 is used as illustration:

Construction parameters: multiple predicate

Construction labels: svSuObIDALLsuAgobAff-

?z?  l?      
Ozo.SUBJ.AGT  cook.PST.H  rice.AFF.DO  sell.PST.H  
PN  V  N  V  
Generated in TypeCraft.  
 
The construction parameter is 
explained as follows: the global tags multiple 
predicate kernel -SVC- provides information 
about constituent type, achievement provides 
information about situation and aspect types, 
declarative provides information about 
propositional types and positive about polarity. 
The construction labels have the 
following structure: Area1 (in italics for ease 
of exposition) gives the global labels, the 
number of verbs in series (ie sv, sv3, sv4 ) as 
well as argument sharing information (coded 
by the label IDALL) and information about 
thematic relations holding across the verb in 
series. Area 2 gives the valence information as 
well as information about grammatical 
function and thematic roles (underlined for 
ease of exposition). Information about the 
situation type of the construction is provided 
by Area 3 and is written in capital letters. 
 Information about tense, aspect, mood 
and negation is also provided by area 1 in the 
construction labels. Sharing of these features 
across verbs in series is represented as with 
sharing of arguments as in example (3) from 
Akan below.

With respect to the global labels in area 1, 
Hellan and Dakubu (2009) uses also the global 
label ev to represent Extended Verb 
Complexes and the label pv for preverbs in 
EVCs. In addition, to the labeling conventions 
used by Hellan and Dakubu (2009) for SVCs 
(sv) and EVCs (ev, pv), the following global 
labels are introduced to account for the range 
of multi-verb constructions in my data.

4. Text , phrasal and construction 
search 
TypeCraft allows for search using different 
word level and sentence level parameters. This 
facilitates comparative analysis in multi-verb 
constructions. For example, argument sharing 
is a property that identifies types of multi-verb 
constructions. A search using the construction 
label svsuObIDALL is used as illustration. The 
result gives an output of serial verb 
constructions in ??d? and Ga consisting of two 
verbs in series with the subject and object 
arguments of the verbs in series sharing 
reference:

global tag svsuObIDALL  
The standardized annotation, search 
parameters and online nature of TypeCraft 
makes it advantageous compared to toolbox, a 
linguistic data management file based system 
used by many linguists in the documentation of 
African languages.  
                                               
5. Conclusion 
Standardized annotations and online databases 
such as TypeCraft aid linguists and speakers of 
a language in research, preservation of 
languages and in producing literacy materials 
that aid education and literacy. My research on 
multi-verb constructions in ??d? is the first in-
depth annotation for ??d? and will be easily 
available for language 
researchers/teachers/students all over the 
world.
