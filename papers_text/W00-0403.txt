Abstract 
We present a multi-document summarizer, called 
MEAD, which generates summaries using 
cluster centroids produced by a topic detection 
and tracking system. We also describe two new 
techniques, based on sentence utility and 
subsumption, which we have applied to the 
evaluation of both single and multiple document 
summaries. Finally, we describe two user studies 
that test our models of multi-document 
summarization. 
1 Introduction 
On October 12, 1999, a relatively small number of 
news sources mentioned in passing that Pakistani 
Defense Minister Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf was away 
visiting Sri Lanka. However, all world agencies 
would be actively reporting on the major events that 
were to happen in Pakistan in the following days: 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced that in Gen. 
Musharrafs absence, the Defense Minister had been 
-sacked and replaced by General Zia Addin. Large 
numbers of  messages from various ources tarted to 
inundate the newswire: about the army's occupation 
of the capital, the Prime Minister's ouster and his 
subsequent placement under house arrest, Gen. 
Musharrafs return to his country, his ascendancy to 
power, and the imposition of military control over 
Pakistan. 
The paragraph above summarizes a large amount of 
news from different sources. While it was not 
automatically generated, one can imagine the use of 
such automatically generated summaries. In this 
paper we will describe how multi-document 
summaries are built and evaluated. 
1.1 Topic detection and multi-document 
summarization 
The process of identifying all articles on an emerging 
event is called Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT). 
A large body of research in TDT has been created 
over the past two years \[Allan et al, 98\]. We will 
present an extension of our own research on TDT 
\[Radev et al, 1999\] to cover summarization f multi- 
document clusters. 
Our entry in the official TDT evaluation, called 
CIDR ~adev et al, 1999\], uses modified TF*IDF to 
produce clusters of  news articles on the same event. 
We developed a new technique for multi-document 
summarization (or MDS), called centroid-based 
summarization (CBS) which uses as input the 
centroids of the clusters produced by CIDR to 
identify which sentences are central to the topic of  
the cluster, rather than the individual articles. We 
have implemented CBS in a system, named MEAD. 
The main contributions of this paper are: the 
development of a centroid-based multi-document 
summarizer, the use of cluster-based sentence utility 
(CBSU) and cross-sentence informational 
subsumption (CSIS) for evaluation of single and 
multi-document summaries, two user studies that 
support our findings, and an evaluation of MEAD. 
An event cluster, produced by a TDT system, 
consists of chronologically ordered news articles 
from multiple sources, which describe an event as it 
develops over time. Event clusters range from2 to 10 
documents from which MEAD produces ummaries 
in the form of sentence xtracts. 
A key feature of MEAD is its use of  cluster centroids, 
which consist of words which are central not only to 
one article in a cluster, but to all the articles. 
MEAD is significantly different from previous work 
on multi-document summarization \[Radev & 
McKeown, 1998; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; 
Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; MeKeown et aI., 1999\], 
21 
which use techniques such as graph matching, 
maximal marginal relevance, or language generation. 
Finally, evaluation of  multi-document summaries i a 
difficult problem. There is not yet a widely accepted 
evaluation scheme. We propose a utility-based 
evaluation scheme, which can be used to evaluate 
both single-document and multi-document 
summaries. 
2 Informational content of sentences 
2.1 Cluster-based sentence utility (CBSU) 
Cluster-based sentence utility (CBSU, or utility) 
refers to the degree of relevance (from 0 to 10) of a " 
particular sentence to the general topic of the entire 
cluster (for a dis cussion of  what is a topic, see \[Allan 
et al 1998\]). A utility of 0 means that the sentence is 
not relevant to the cluster and a 10 inarks an essential 
sentence. 
2.2 Cross -sentence  in fo rmat iona l  
subsumption (CS IS)  
A related notion to CBSU is cross-sentence 
informational subsumption (CSIS, or subsumption), 
which reflects that certain sentences repeat some of  
the information present in other sentences and may, 
therefore, be omitted during summarization. If the 
information content of  sentence a (denoted as i(a)) is 
contained within sentence b, then a becomes 
informationally redundant and the content of b is said 
to subsume that of a: 
i(a) c: i(b) 
In the example below, (2) subsumes (1) because the 
crucial information in (1) is also included in (2) 
which presents additional content: "the court", "last. 
August", and "sentenced him to life". 
(1) John Doe was found guilty of the murder. 
(2) The court found John Doe guilty of the murder 
of Jane Doe last August and sentenced him to life. 
The cluster shown in Figure I shows subsumption 
links across two articles ~ about recent terrorist 
activities in Algeria (ALG 18853 and ALG 18854). 
An arrow from sentence A to sentence B indicates 
that the information content of A is subsumed by the 
information content of B. Sentences 2, 4, and 5 from 
the first article repeat he information from sentence 
I The full text of these articles is shown in the 
Appendix. 
2 in the second article, while sentence' 9 from the 
former article is later repeated in sentences 3 and 4 of 
the latter article. 
Figure 1: Subsumption links across two articles: 
ALG 18853 and ALG 18854. 
2.3 Equivalence classes of sentences 
Sentences subsuming each other are said to belong to 
the same equivalence class. An equivalence class 
may contain more than two sentences within the 
same or different articles. In the following example, 
although sentences (3) and (4) are not exact 
paraphrases of each other, they can be substituted for 
each other without crucial loss of information and 
therefore belong to the same equivalence class, i.e. 
i(3) c i(4) and i(4) c i(3). In the user study section 
we will take a look at the way humans perceive CSIS 
and equivalence class. 
(3) Eighteen decapitated bodies have been found 
in a mass grave in northern Algeria, press reports 
said Thursday. 
(4) Algerian newspapers have reported on 
Thursday that 18 decapitated bodies have been 
found by the authorities. 
2.4 Comparison with MMR 
Maximal marginal relevance (or MMR) is a 
technique similar to CSIS and was introduced in 
\[Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998\]. In that paper, MMR 
is used to produce summaries of single documents 
that avoid redundancy. The authors mention that their 
preliminary results indicate that multiple documents 
on the same topic also contain redundancy but they 
fall short of using MMR for multi-document 
summarization. Their metric is used as an 
enhancement to a query-based summary whereas 
CSIS is designed for query-independent (a.k.a., 
generic) summaries.

3.1 Descr ip t ion  o f  the  corpus 
For our experiments, we prepared, a small corpus 
consisting of a total of 558 sentences in 27 
documents, organized in 6 clusters (Table 1), all 
extracted by CIDR. Four of the clusters are from 
Usenet newsgroups. The remaining two clusters are 
from the official TDT corpus 2. Among the factors for 
our selection of clusters are: coverage of as many 
news sources as possible, coverage of both TDT and 
non-TDT data, coverage of different ypes of news 
(e.g., terrorism, internal affairs, and environment), 
and diversity in cluster sizes (in our case, from 2 to 
10 articles). The test corpus is used in the evaluation 
in such a way that each cluster is summarized at 9 
different compression rates, thus giving nine times as 
many sample points as one would expect from the 
size of the corpus. 
3.2 Cluster centroids 
Table 2 shows a sample centroid, produced by CIDR 
\[Radev et al, 1999\] from cluster A. The "count" 
column indicates the average number of occurrences 
of a word'across the entire cluster. The IDF values 
were computed from the TDT corpus. A centroid, in 
this context, is a pseudo-document which consists of 
words which have Count*IDF scores above a pre- 
defined threshold in the documents that constitute the 
cluster. CIDR computes Count*IDF in an iterative 
fashion, updating its values as more articles are 
inserted in a given cluster. We hypothesize that 
sentences that contain the words from the centroid 
are more indicative of the topic of the cluster. 
2 The selection of Cluster E is due to an idea by the 
participants in the Novelty Detection Workshop, led 
by James Allan.

3.3 Cent ro id -based  a lgor i thm 
MEAD decides which sentences to include in the 
extract by ranking them according to a set of  
parameters. The input to MEAD is a cluster of 
articles (e.g., extracted by CIDR) and a value for the 
compression rate r. For example, if  the cluster 
contains a total of 50 sentences (n = 50) and the 
value of r is 20%, the output of MEAD will contain 
10 sentences. Sentences are laid in the same order as 
they appear in the original documents with 
documents ordered chronologically. We benefit here 
from the time stamps associated with each document. 
SCORE (s) = Z i  (wcC, + + wpJ  
where i (1 ~ i ~_ n) is the sentence number within 
the cluster. 
INPUT: Cluster of d documents 3 with n sentences 
(compression rate = r) 
3 Note that currently, MEAD requires that sentence 
boundaries be marked.

4.2.3 System performance (S) 
The system performance S is one of the numbers 6 
described in the previous subsection. For { 13}, the 
value of S is 0.627 (which is lower than random). For 
{14}, S is 0.833, which is between R and J. In the 
example, only two of the six possible sentence 
selections, {14} and {24} are between R and J. Three 
others, {13}, {23}, and {34} are below R. while {12} 
is better than J. 
4.2.4. Normalized system performance (1)) 
To restrict system performance (mostly) between 0 
and 1, we use a mapping between R and J in such a 
way that when S ffi R, the normalized system 
performance, D, is equal to 0 and when S = J, D 
becomes 1. The corresponding linear function 7is: 
D = (S-R) / (J-R) 
Figure 2 shows the mapping .between system 
performance S on the left (a) and normalized system 
performance D on the fight Co). A small part of the 0- 
i segment is mapped to the entire 0-1 segment; 
therefore the difference between two systems, 
performing at e.g., 0.785 and 0.812 can be 
significant!

Example: the normalized system performance for the 
{14} system then becomes (0.833 - 0.732)/(0.841 - 
0.732) or 0.927. Since the score is close to I, the 
{14} system is almost as good as the interjudge 
agreement. The normalized system performance for 
the {24} system is similarly (0.837 - 0.732) / (0.841

- 0.732) or 0.963. Of the two systems, {24} 
outperforms { 14}. 
4.3 Using CSIS to evaluate multi-document 
summaries 
To use CSIS in the evaluation, we introduce a new 
parameter, E, which tells us how much to penalize a
system that includes redundant information. In the 
example from Table 7 (arrows indicate subsumption), 
a summarizer with r = 20% needs to pick 2 out of 12 
sentences. Suppose that it picks 1/I and 2/1 (in bold). 
l fE  = 1, it should get full credit of 20 utility points. If  
E = 0, it should get no credit for the second sentence 
as it is subsumed by the first sentence. By varying E 
between 0 and 1, the evaluation may favor or ignore 
subsumption.

5 User studies and system evaluation 
We ran two user experiments. First, six judges were 
each given six clusters and asked to ascribe an 
importance score from 0 to 10 to each sentence 
within a particular cluster. Next, five judges had to 
indicate for each sentence which other sentence(s), if  
any, it subsumes s.
5.1 CBSU: interjudge agreement 
Using the techniques described in Section 0, we 
computed the cross-judge agreement (J) for the 6 
clusters for various r (Figure 3). Overall, interjudge 
agreement was quite high. An interesting drop in 
interjudge agreement occurs for 20-30% summaries. 
The drop most likely results from the fact that 10% 
summaries are typically easier to produce because the 
few most imporiant sentences in a cluster are easier 
to identify. 
s We should note that both annotation tasks were 
quite time consuming and frustrating for the users 
who took anywhere from 6 to 10 hours each to 
complete their part.

5.2 CSIS:  in ter judge  agreement  
In the second experiment, we asked users to indicate 
all cases when within a cluster, a sentence is 
subsumed by another. The judges' data on the first 
seven sentences of cluster A are shown in Table 8. 
The "+ score" indicates the number of judges who 
agree on the most frequent subsumption. The '-* 
score" indicates that the consensus was no 
subsumption. We found relatively low interjudge 
agreement on the cases in which at least one judge 
indicated evidence of subsumption. Overall, out of 
558 sentences, there was full agreement (5judges) on 
292 sentences (Table 9). Unfortunately, h 291 of 
these 292 sentences the agreement was that there is 
no subsumption. When the bar of agreement was 
lowered to four judges, 23 out of 406 agreements are 
on sentences with subsumption. Overall, out of 80 
sentences with subsumption, only 24 had an 
agreement of four or more judges. However, in 54 
eases at least hree judges agreed on the presence of a 
particular instance of subsumption.

In conclusion, we found very high interjudge 
agreement in the first experiment and moderately 
low agreement in the second experiment. We 
concede that the time necessary to do a proper job 
at the second task is partly to blame. 
5.3 Eva luat ion  o f  MEAD 
Since the baseline of random sentence selection is 
already included in the evaluation formulae, we 
used the Lead-based method (selecting the

evaluate our syt;tem. 
In Table 10 we show the normalized performance 
(D) of MEAD, for the six clusters at nine 
compression rates. MEAD performed better than 
Lead in 29 (in bold) out of 54 cases. Note that for 
the largest cluster, Cluster D, MEAD outperformed 
Lead at all compression rates.

We then modified the MEAD algorithm to include 
lead information as well as centroids (see Section 0). 
In this case, MEAD+Lead performed better than the 
Lead baseline in 41 cases. We are in the process of 
running experiments with other SCORE formulas. 
5.4 D iscuss ion  
It may seem that utility-based evaluation requires too 
much effort and is prone to low interjudge agreement. 
We believe that our results show that interjudge 
agreement is quite high. As far as the amount of  
effort required, we believe that the larger effort on 
the part of the judges is more or less compensated 
with the ability to evaluate summaries off-line and at 
variable compression rates. Alternative valuations 
don't make such evaluations possible. We should 
concede that a utility-based approach is probably not 
feasible for query-based summaries as these are 
typically done only on-line. 
We discussed the possibility of  a sentence 
contributing negatively to the utility of another 
sentence due to redundancy. We should also point out 
that sentences can also reinforce one another 
positively. For example, if  a sentence mentioning a
new entity is included in a summary, one might also 
want to include a sentence that puts the entity in the 
context of the re?t of the article or cluster. 
6 Contributions and future work 
We presented a new multi-document summarizer, 
MEAD. It summarizes clusters of news articles 
automatically grouped by a topic detection system. 
MEAD uses information from the centroids of the 
clusters to select sentences that are most likely to be 
relevant to the cluster topic. 
We used a new utility-based technique, CBSU, for 
the evaluation of  MEAD and of summarizers in 
general. We found that MEAD produces ummaries 
that are similar in quality to the ones produced by 
humans. We also compared MEAD's performance to 
an alternative method, multi-document lead, and 
28 
showed how MEAD's sentence scoring weights can 
be modified to produce summaries significantly 
better than the alternatives. 
We also looked at a property of multi-document 
chisters, namely cross-sentence information 
subsumption (which is related to the MMR metric 
proposed in \[Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998\]) and 
showed how it can be used in evaluating multi- 
document summaries. 
All our findings are backed by the analysis of two 
experiments hat we performed with human subjects. 
We found that the interjudge agreement on sentence 
utility is very high while the agreement on cross- 
sentence subsumption is moderately low, although 
promising. 
In the future, we would like to test our 
multidocument summarizer on a larger corpus and 
improve the summarization algorithm. We would 
also like to explore how the techniques we proposed 
here can be used for multiligual multidocument 
summarization.
