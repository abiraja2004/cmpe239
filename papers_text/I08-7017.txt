Abstract 
Urdu is spoken by more than 100 million 
speakers.  This paper summarizes the cor-
pus and lexical resources being developed 
for Urdu by the CRULP, in Pakistan.     
1 Introduction 
Urdu is the national language of Pakistan and one 
of the state languages of India and has more than 
60 million first language speakers and more than 
100 million total speakers in more than 20 coun-
tries (Gordon 2005) .  Urdu is written in Nastalique 
writing style based on Perso-Arabic script.  This 
paper focuses on the Urdu resources being devel-
oped, which can be used for research in computa-
tional linguistics.   
2 Urdu Text Encoding 
Urdu computing started early, in 1980s, creating 
multiple encodings, as a standard encoding scheme 
was missing at that time.  With the advent of Uni-
code in early 1990s, some online publications have 
switched to Unicode, but much of the publication 
still continues to follow the ad hoc encodings 
(Hussain et al 2006).   Two main on-line sources 
of Urdu text in Unicode are Jang News  
(www.Jang.net/Urdu) and BBC Urdu service 
(www.BBC.co.uk/Urdu) and are thus good sources 
of corpus.  Encoding conversion may be required if 
data is acquired from other sources. 
3 Corpora 
EMILLE Project, initiated by Lancaster Univer-
sity is one of the first initiatives to make Urdu cor-
pus available for research and development of lan-
guage processing (McEnery et al 2000).  The pro-
ject has released 200,000 words of English text 
translated into Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi 
and Urdu, creating a parallel corpus across these 
languages.  In addition, the corpus also has 
512,000 words of Spoken Urdu, from BBC Radio.  
Moreover, the corpus also contains 1,640,000 
words of Urdu text.  These Urdu corpus resources 
are also annotated with a large morpho-syntactic 
tag-set (Hardie 2003).   
Center for Research in Urdu Language Process-
ing (CRULP) at National University of Computer 
and Emerging Sciences in Pakistan has also been 
developing corpora and associated tools for Urdu.  
A recent project collected a raw corpus of 19 mil-
lion words of Urdu text mostly from Jang News, 
reduced to 18 million words after cleaning.  The 
corpus collection has been based on LC-STAR II 
guidelines1.  The domain-wise figures are given in 
Table 1.  Further details of the corpus and associ-
ated information are discussed by Ijaz et al (2007).

Agreement between CRULP and Jang News al-
lows internal use.  However, due to distribution 
restrictions in this agreement, the corpus has not 
been made publicly available.  The distribution 
rights are still being negotiated with Jang News. 
The tag set developed by Hardie (2003) is based 
on morpho-syntactic analysis.  A (much reduced) 
syntactic tag set has also been developed by

CRULP (on the lines of PENN Treebank tagset), 
available at its website www.CRULP.org.  A cor-
pus of 100,000 words manually tagged on this tag 
set has also been developed based on text from 
Jang online news service.  This CRULP POS 
Tagged Jang News Corpus is available through the 
center.   
Recently another corpus of about 40,000 words 
annotated with Named Entity tags was also made 
available for Workshop on NER for South and 
South East Asian Languages organized at IJCNLP 
2008.  The annotated corpus was donated by 
CRULP and IIIT Hyderabad and is available at 
http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=5.  
Tag set contains 12 tags.  Details of these tags are 
discussed at the link http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-
08/index.cgi?topic=3.  The CRULP portion of the 
data is also available at CRULP website, and is a 
subset of the CRULP POS Tagged Jang News 
Corpus.   
In earlier work at CRULP, a 230 spelling errors 
corpus has also been developed based on typo-
graphical errors in Newspapers and student term 
papers.  See Naseem et al (2007) for details.   
A corpus of Urdu Names has also been devel-
oped by CRULP, based on the collective telephone 
directories of Pakistan Telecommunications Cor-
poration Limited (PTCL) from across all major 
cities of Pakistan.  A name list has also been ex-
tracted from the corpus for all person names, ad-
dresses and cities of Pakistan.   
4 Lexica 
Lexica are as critical for development of language 
computing as corpora.  One of the most 
comprehensive lexica available for Urdu was 
recently released by CRULP (available through 
CRULP website).  The online version, called 
Online Urdu Dictionary (OUD) contains 120,000 
entries, with 80,000 words annotated with 
significant information.  The data of OUD is XML 
tagged, as per the annotation schema discussed by 
Rahman (2005; pp. 15), which contains about 20 
etymological, phonetic, morphological, syntactic, 
semantic and other parameters of information 
about a word.  The dictionary also gives translation 
of 12000 words in English and work is under way 
to enable runtime user-defined queries on the 
available XML tags.  The contents of this lexicon 
are based on the 21 volume Urdu Lughat 
developed by Urdu Dictionary Board of 
Government of Pakistan.  See www.crulp.org/oud 
for details.   
CRULP has also developed a corpus based lexi-
con of 50,000 words with frequency data and an-
notation specifications defined by LC-STAR II 
project (at http://www.lc-star.org/docs/LC-
STAR_D1.1_v1.3.doc).  Details of the lexicon an-
notation scheme are given by Ijaz et al (2007).   
There are also additional tools available through 
CRULP, and documented at its website, including 
normalization, collations, spell checking, POS tag-
ging and word segmentation applications. 
5 Conclusions 
This paper lists some core linguistic resources of 
Urdu, available through CRULP and other sources.  
However, the paper identifies licensing constraints, 
a challenge for open distribution, which needs to 
be addressed.
