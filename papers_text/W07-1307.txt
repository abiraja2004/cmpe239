Abstract
Pair Hidden Markov Models (PairHMMs)
are trained to align the pronunciation tran-
scriptions of a large contemporary collec-
tion of Dutch dialect material, the Goeman-
Taeldeman-Van Reenen-Project (GTRP, col-
lected 1980?1995). We focus on the ques-
tion of how to incorporate information about
sound segment distances to improve se-
quence distance measures for use in di-
alect comparison. PairHMMs induce seg-
ment distances via expectation maximisa-
tion (EM). Our analysis uses a phonologi-
cally comparable subset of 562 items for all
424 localities in the Netherlands. We evalu-
ate the work first via comparison to analyses
obtained using the Levenshtein distance on
the same dataset and second, by comparing
the quality of the induced vowel distances to
acoustic differences.
1 Introduction
Dialectology catalogues the geographic distribution
of the linguistic variation that is a necessary condi-
tion for language change (Wolfram and Schilling-
Estes, 2003), and is sometimes successful in iden-
tifying geographic correlates of historical develop-
ments (Labov, 2001). Computational methods for
studying dialect pronunciation variation have been
successful using various edit distance and related
string distance measures, but unsuccessful in us-
ing segment differences to improve these (Heeringa,
2004). The most successful techniques distinguish
consonants and vowels, but treat e.g. all the vowel
differences as the same. Ignoring the special treat-
ment of vowels vs. consonants, the techniques re-
gard segments in a binary fashion?as alike or
different?in spite of the overwhelming consensus
that some sounds are much more alike than others.
There have been many attempts to incorporate more
sensitive segment differences, which do not neces-
sarily perform worse in validation, but they fail to
show significant improvement (Heeringa, 2004).
Instead of using segment distances as these are
(incompletely) suggested by phonetic or phonolog-
ical theory, we can also attempt to acquire these
automatically. Mackay and Kondrak (2005) in-
troduce Pair Hidden Markov Models (PairHMMs)
to language studies, applying them to the problem
of recognising ?cognates? in the sense of machine
translation, i.e. pairs of words in different languages
that are similar enough in sound and meaning to
serve as translation equivalents. Such words may
be cognate in the sense of historical linguistics, but
they may also be borrowings from a third language.
We apply PairHMMs to dialect data for the first time
in this paper. Like Mackay and Kondrak (2005) we
evaluate the results both on a specific task, in our
case, dialect classification, and also via examination
of the segment substitution probabilities induced by
the PairHMM training procedures. We suggest us-
ing the acoustic distances between vowels as a probe
to explore the segment substitution probabilities in-
duced by the PairHMMs.
Naturally, this validation procedure only makes
sense if dialects are using acoustically more similar
sounds in their variation, rather than, for example,
48
randomly varied sounds. But why should linguistic
and geographic proximity be mirrored by frequency
of correspondence? Historical linguistics suggests
that sound changes propagate geographically, which
means that nearby localities should on average share
the most changes. In addition some changes are con-
vergent to local varieties, increasing the tendency
toward local similarity. The overall effect in both
cases strengthens the similarity of nearby varieties.
Correspondences among more distant varieties are
more easily disturbed by intervening changes and
decreasing strength of propagation.
2 Material
In this study the most recent Dutch dialect data
source is used: data from the Goeman-Taeldeman-
Van Reenen-project (GTRP; Goeman and Taelde-
man, 1996). The GTRP consists of digital tran-
scriptions for 613 dialect varieties in the Netherlands
(424 varieties) and Belgium (189 varieties), gath-
ered during the period 1980?1995. For every vari-
ety, a maximum of 1876 items was narrowly tran-
scribed according to the International Phonetic Al-
phabet. The items consisted of separate words and
word groups, including pronominals, adjectives and
nouns. A more detailed overview of the data collec-
tion is given in Taeldeman and Verleyen (1999).
Since the GTRP was compiled with a view to
documenting both phonological and morphological
variation (De Schutter et al, 2005) and our pur-
pose here is the analysis of variation in pronunci-
ation, many items of the GTRP are ignored. We
use the same 562 item subset as introduced and dis-
cussed in depth by Wieling et al (2007). In short,
the 1876 item word list was filtered by selecting
only single word items, plural nouns (the singular
form was preceded by an article and therefore not in-
cluded), base forms of adjectives instead of compar-
ative forms and the first-person plural verb instead
of other forms. We omit words whose variation is
primarily morphological as we wish to focus on pro-
nunciation.
Because the GTRP transcriptions of Belgian vari-
eties are fundamentally different from transcriptions
of Netherlandic varieties (Wieling et al, 2007), we
will focus our analysis on the 424 varieties in the
Netherlands. The geographic distribution of these

varieties is shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, note
that we will not look at diacritics, but only at the
phonetic symbols (82 in total).
3 The Pair Hidden Markov Model
In this study we will use a Pair Hidden Markov
Model (PairHMM), which is essentially a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) adapted to assign similar-
ity scores to word pairs and to use these similarity
scores to compute string distances. In general an
HMM generates an observation sequence (output)
by starting in one of the available states based on the
initial probabilities, going from state to state based
on the transition probabilities while emitting an out-
put symbol in each state based on the emission prob-
ability of that output symbol in that state. The prob-
ability of an observation sequence given the HMM
can be calculated by using well known HMM algo-
rithms such as the Forward algorithm and the Viterbi
algorithms (e.g., see Rabiner, 1989).
The only difference between the PairHMM and
the HMM is that it outputs a pair of symbols in-
stead of only one symbol. Hence it generates two
(aligned) observation streams instead of one. The
PairHMM was originally proposed by Durbin et al
(1998) and has successfully been used for aligning

tesy of Mackay and Kondrak (2005).
biological sequences. Mackay and Kondrak (2005)
adapted the algorithm to calculate similarity scores
for word pairs in orthographic form, focusing on
identifying translation equivalents in bilingual cor-
pora.
Their modified PairHMM has three states repre-
senting the basic edit operations: a substitution state
(M), a deletion state (X) and an insertion state (Y). In
the substitution state two symbols are emitted, while
in the other two states a gap and a symbol are emit-
ted, corresponding with a deletion and an insertion,
respectively. The model is shown in Figure 2. The
four transition parameters are specified by ?, ?, ?
and ? . There is no explicit start state; the proba-
bility of starting in one of the three states is equal to
the probability of going from the substitution state to
that state. In our case we use the PairHMM to align
phonetically transcribed words. A possible align-
ment (including the state sequence) for the two ob-
servation streams [mO@lk@] and [mEl@k] (Dutch di-
alectal variants of the word ?milk?) is given by:
m O @ l k @
m E l @ k
M M X M Y M X
We have several ways to calculate the similarity
score for a given word pair when the transition and
emission probabilities are known. First, we can use
the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the probability of
the best alignment and use this probability as a sim-
ilarity score (after correcting for length; see Mackay
and Kondrak, 2005). Second, we can use the For-
ward algorithm, which takes all possible alignments
into account, to calculate the probability of the ob-
servation sequence given the PairHMM and use this
probability as a similarity score (again corrected for
length; see Mackay, 2004 for the adapted PairHMM
Viterbi and Forward algorithms).
A third method to calculate the similarity score is
using the log-odds algorithm (Durbin et al, 1998).
The log-odds algorithm uses a random model to rep-
resent how likely it is that a pair of words occur to-
gether while they have no underlying relationship.
Because we are looking at word alignments, this
means an alignment consisting of no substitutions
but only insertions and deletions. Mackay and Kon-
drak (2005) propose a randommodel which has only
insertion and deletion states and generates one word
completely before the other, e.g.
m O @ l k @
m E l @ k
X X X X X X Y Y Y Y Y
The model is described by the transition proba-
bility ? and is displayed in Figure 3. The emis-
sion probabilities can be either set equal to the inser-
tion and deletion probabilities of the word similarity
model (Durbin et al, 1998) or can be specified sepa-
rately based on the token frequencies in the data set
(Mackay and Kondrak, 2005).
The final log-odds similarity score of a word pair
is calculated by dividing the Viterbi or Forward
probability by the probability generated by the ran-
dom model, and subsequently taking the logarithm
of this value. When using the Viterbi algorithm
the regular log-odds score is obtained, while using
the Forward algorithm yields the Forward log-odds
score (Mackay, 2004). Note that there is no need
for additional normalisation; by dividing two mod-
els we are already implicitly normalising.
Before we are able to use the algorithms de-
scribed above, we have to estimate the emission
probabilities (i.e. insertion, substitution and dele-
tion probabilities) and transition probabilities of the
model. These probabilities can be estimated by us-
ing the Baum-Welch expectation maximisation al-
gorithm (Baum et al, 1970). The Baum-Welch algo-

rithm iteratively reestimates the transition and emis-
sion probabilities until a local optimum is found and
has time complexity O(TN2), where N is the num-
ber of states and T is the length of the observa-
tion sequence. The Baum-Welch algorithm for the
PairHMM is described in detail in Mackay (2004).
3.1 Calculating dialect distances
When the parameters of the complete model have
been determined, the model can be used to calculate
the alignment probability for every word pair. As in
Mackay and Kondrak (2005) and described above,
we use the Forward and Viterbi algorithms in both
their regular (normalised for length) and log-odds
form to calculate similarity scores for every word
pair. Subsequently, the distance between two dialec-
tal varieties can be obtained by calculating all word
pair scores and averaging them.
4 The Levenshtein distance
The Levenshtein distance was introduced by Kessler
(1995) as a tool for measuring linguistic distances
between language varieties and has been success-
fully applied in dialect comparison (Nerbonne et al,
1996; Heeringa, 2004). For this comparison we use
a slightly modified version of the Levenshtein dis-
tance algorithm, which enforces a linguistic syllab-
icity constraint: only vowels may match with vow-
els, and consonants with consonants. The specific
details of this modification are described in more de-
tail in Wieling et al (2007).
We do not normalise the Levenshtein distance
measurement for length, because Heeringa et al
(2006) showed that results based on raw Levenshtein
distances are a better approximation of dialect dif-
ferences as perceived by the dialect speakers than
results based on the normalised Levenshtein dis-
tances. Finally, all substitutions, insertions and dele-
tions have the same weight.
5 Results
To obtain the best model probabilities, we trained
the PairHMM with all data available from the 424
Netherlandic localities. For every locality there were
on average 540 words with an average length of 5
tokens. To prevent order effects in training, every
word pair was considered twice (e.g., wa ? wb and
wb?wa). Therefore, in one training iteration almost
100 million word pairs had to be considered. To be
able to train with these large amounts of data, a par-
allel implementation of the PairHMM software was
implemented. After starting with more than 6700
uniform initial substitution probabilities, 82 inser-
tion and deletion probabilities and 5 transition prob-
abilities, convergence was reached after nearly 1500
iterations, taking 10 parallel processors each more
than 10 hours of computation time.
In the following paragraphs we will discuss the
quality of the trained substitution probabilities as
well as comment on the dialectological results ob-
tained with the trained model.
5.1 Trained substitution probabilities
We are interested both in how well the overall se-
quence distances assigned by the trained PairHMMs
reveal the dialectological landscape of the Nether-
lands, and also in how well segment distances in-
duced by the Baum-Welch training (i.e. based on
the substitution probabilities) reflect linguistic real-
ity. A first inspection of the latter is a simple check
on howwell standard classifications are respected by
the segment distances induced.
Intuitively, the probabilities of substituting a
vowel with a vowel or a consonant with a conso-
nant (i.e. same-type substitution) should be higher
than the probabilities of substituting a vowel with a
consonant or vice versa (i.e. different-type substitu-
tion). Also the probability of substituting a phonetic
51
symbol with itself (i.e. identity substitution) should
be higher than the probability of a substitution with
any other phonetic symbol. To test this assumption,
we compared the means of the above three substi-
tution groups for vowels, consonants and both types
together.
In line with our intuition, we found a higher prob-
ability for an identity substitution as opposed to
same-type and different-type non-identity substitu-
tions, as well as a higher probability for a same-type
substitution as compared to a different-type substitu-
tion. This result was highly significant in all cases:
vowels (all p?s ? 0.020), consonants (all p?s <
0.001) and both types together (all p?s < 0.001).
5.2 Vowel substitution scores compared to
acoustic distances
PairHMMs assign high probabilities (and scores)
to the emission of segment pairs that are more
likely to be found in training data. Thus we expect
frequent dialect correspondences to acquire high
scores. Since phonetic similarity effects alignment
and segment correspondences, we hypothesise that
phonetically similar segment correspondences will
be more usual than phonetically remote ones, more
specifically that there should be a negative correla-
tion between PairHMM-induced segment substitu-
tion probabilities presented above and phonetic dis-
tances.
We focus on segment distances among vowels,
because it is straightforward to suggest a measure
of distance for these (but not for consonants). Pho-
neticians and dialectologists use the two first for-
mants (the resonant frequencies created by different
forms of the vocal cavity during pronunciation) as
the defining physical characteristics of vowel qual-
ity. The first two formants correspond to the ar-
ticulatory vowel features height and advancement.
We follow variationist practice in ignoring third and
higher formants. Using formant frequencies we can
calculate the acoustic distances between vowels.
Because the occurrence frequency of the pho-
netic symbols influences substitution probability, we
do not compare substitution probabilities directly to
acoustic distances. To obtain comparable scores, the
substitution probabilities are divided by the product
of the relative frequencies of the two phonetic sym-
bols used in the substitution. Since substitutions in-
volving similar infrequent segments now get a much
higher score than substitutions involving similar, but
frequent segments, the logarithm of the score is used
to bring the respective scores into a comparable
scale.
In the program PRAAT we find Hertz values
of the first three formants for Dutch vowels pro-
nounced by 50 male (Pols et al, 1973) and 25 fe-
male (Van Nierop et al, 1973) speakers of stan-
dard Dutch. The vowels were pronounced in a /hVt/
context, and the quality of the phonemes for which
we have formant information should be close to the
vowel quality used in the GTRP transcriptions. By
averaging over 75 speakers we reduce the effect of
personal variation. For comparison we chose only
vowels that are pronounced as monophthongs in
standard Dutch, in order to exclude interference of
changing diphthong vowel quality with the results.
Nine vowels were used: /i, I, y, Y, E, a, A, O, u/.
We calculated the acoustic distances between all
vowel pairs as a Euclidean distance of the formant
values. Since our perception of frequency is non-
linear, using Hertz values of the formants when cal-
culating the Euclidean distances would not weigh
F1 heavily enough. We therefore transform frequen-
cies to Bark scale, in better keeping with human per-
ception. The correlation between the acoustic vowel
distances based on two formants in Bark and the log-
arithmical and frequency corrected PairHMM sub-
stitution scores is r = ?0.65 (p < 0.01). But
Lobanov (1971) and Adank (2003) suggested using
standardised z-scores, where the normalisation is
applied over the entire vowel set produced by a given
speaker (one normalisation per speaker). This helps
in smoothing the voice differences between men and
women. Normalising frequencies in this way re-
sulted in a correlation of r = ?0.72 (p < 0.001)
with the PairHMM substitution scores. Figure 4 vi-
sualises this result. Both Bark scale and z-values
gave somewhat lower correlations when the third
formant was included in the measures.
The strong correlation demonstrates that the
PairHMM scores reflect phonetic (dis)similarity.
The higher the probability that vowels are aligned
in PairHMM training, the smaller the acoustic dis-
tance between two segments. We conclude therefore
that the PairHMM indeed aligns linguistically corre-
sponding segments in accord with phonetic similar-

PairHMM scores. Acoustic vowel distances are cal-
culated via Euclidean distance based on the first two

ity. This likewise confirms that dialect differences
tend to be acoustically slight rather than large, and
suggests that PairHMMs are attuned to the slight
differences which accumulate locally during lan-
guage change. Also we can be more optimistic
about combining segment distances and sequence
distance techniques, in spite of Heeringa (2004,
Ch. 4) who combined formant track segment dis-
tances with Levenshtein distances without obtaining
improved results.
5.3 Dialectological results
To see how well the PairHMM results reveal the di-
alectological landscape of the Netherlands, we cal-
culated the dialect distances with the Viterbi and
Forward algorithms (in both their normalised and
log-odds version) using the trained model parame-
ters.
To assess the quality of the PairHMM results,
we used the LOCAL INCOHERENCE measurement
which measures the degree to which geographically
close varieties also represent linguistically similar
varieties (Nerbonne and Kleiweg, 2005). Just as
Mackay and Kondrak (2005), we found the over-
all best performance was obtained using the log-
odds version of Viterbi algorithm (with insertion and
deletion probabilities based on the token frequen-
cies).
Following Mackay and Kondrak (2005), we also
experimented with a modified PairHMM obtained
by setting non-substitution parameters constant.
Rather than using the transition, insertion and dele-
tion parameters (see Figure 2) of the trained model,
we set these to a constant value as we are most
interested in the effects of the substitution param-
eters. We indeed found slightly increased perfor-
mance (in terms of LOCAL INCOHERENCE) for the
simplified model with constant transition parame-
ters. However, since there was a very high corre-
lation (r = 0.98) between the full and the simplified
model and the resulting clustering was also highly
similar, we will use the Viterbi log-odds algorithm
using all trained parameters to represent the results
obtained with the PairHMM method.
5.4 PairHMM vs. Levenshtein results
The PairHMM yielded dialectological results quite
similar to those of Levenshtein distance. The LOCAL
INCOHERENCE of the two methods was similar, and
the dialect distance matrices obtained from the two
techniques correlated highly (r = 0.89). Given that
the Levenshtein distance has been shown to yield re-
sults that are consistent (Cronbach?s ? = 0.99) and
valid when compared to dialect speakers judgements
of similarity (r ? 0.7), this means in particular that
the PairHMMs are detecting dialectal variation quite
well.
Figure 5 shows the dialectal maps for the results
obtained using the Levenshtein algorithm (top) and
the PairHMM algorithm (bottom). The maps on the
left show a clustering in ten groups based on UP-
GMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arith-
metic mean; see Heeringa, 2004 for a detailed expla-
nation). In these maps phonetically close dialectal
varieties are marked with the same symbol. How-
ever note that the symbols can only be compared
within a map, not between the two maps (e.g., a di-
alectal variety indicated by a square in the top map
does not need to have a relationship with a dialec-
tal variety indicated by a square in the bottom map).
Because clustering is unstable, in that small differ-
ences in input data can lead to large differences in
the classifications derived, we repeatedly added ran-
dom small amounts of noise to the data and iter-
atively generated the cluster borders based on the
53
Figure 5. Dialect distances for Levenshtein method (top) and PairHMM method (bottom). The maps on
the left show the ten main clusters for both methods, indicated by distinct symbols. Note that the shape of
these symbols can only be compared within a map, not between the top and bottom maps. The maps in the
middle show robust cluster borders (darker lines indicate more robust cluster borders) obtained by repeated
clustering using random small amounts of noise. The maps on the right show for each locality a vector
towards the region which is phonetically most similar. See section 5.4 for further explanation.
54
noisy input data. Only borders which showed up
during most of the 100 iterations are shown in the
map. The maps in the middle show the most ro-
bust cluster borders; darker lines indicate more ro-
bust borders. The maps on the right show a vector at
each locality pointing in the direction of the region
it is phonetically most similar to.
A number of observations can be made on the
basis of these maps. The most important observa-
tion is that the maps show very similar results. For
instance, in both methods a clear distinction can
be seen between the Frisian varieties (north) and
their surroundings as well as the Limburg varieties
(south) and their surroundings. Some differences
can also be observed. For instance, at first glance
the Frisian cities among the Frisian varieties are sep-
arate clusters in the PairHMM method, while this
is not the case for the Levenshtein method. Since
the Frisian cities differ from their surroundings a
great deal, this point favours the PairHMM. How-
ever, when looking at the deviating vectors for the
Frisian cities in the two vector maps, it is clear that
the techniques again yield similar results. Note that
a more detailed description of the results using the
Levenshtein distance on the GTRP data can be found
in Wieling et al (2007).
Although the PairHMM method is much more so-
phisticated than the Levenshtein method, it yields
very similar results. This may be due to the fact
that the data sets are large enough to compensate for
the lack of sensitivity in the Levenshtein technique,
and the fact that we are evaluating the techniques at
a high level of aggregation (average differences in
540-word samples).
6 Discussion
The present study confirms Mackay and Kondrak?s
(2004) work showing that PairHMMs align linguis-
tic material well and that they induce reasonable seg-
ment distances at the same time. We have extended
that work by applying PairHMMs to dialectal data,
and by evaluating the induced segment distances via
their correlation with acoustic differences. We noted
above that it is not clear whether the dialectological
results improve on the simple Levenshtein measures,
and that this may be due to the level of aggregation
and the large sample sizes. But we would also like
to test PairHMMs on a data set for which more sen-
sitive validation is possible, e.g. the Norwegian set
for which dialect speakers judgements of proximity
is available (Heeringa et al, 2006); this is clearly a
point at which further work would be rewarding.
At a more abstract level, we emphasise that the
correlation between acoustic distances on the one
hand and the segment distances induced by the
PairHMMs on the other confirm both that align-
ments created by the PairHMMs are linguistically
responsible, and also that this linguistic structure in-
fluences the range of variation. The segment dis-
tances induced by the PairHMMs reflect the fre-
quency with which such segments need to be aligned
in Baum-Welch training. It would be conceivable
that dialect speakers used all sorts of correspon-
dences to signal their linguistic provenance, but they
do not. Instead, they tend to use variants which are
linguistically close at the segment level.
Finally, we note that the view of diachronic
change as on the one hand the accumulation of
changes propagating geographically, and on the
other hand as the result of a tendency toward local
convergence suggests that we should find linguis-
tically similar varieties nearby rather than further
away. The segment correspondences PairHMMs in-
duce correspond to those found closer geographi-
cally.
We have assumed a dialectological perspective
here, focusing on local variation (Dutch), and using
similarity of pronunciation as the organising varia-
tionist principle. For the analysis of relations among
languages that are further away from each other?
temporally and spatially?there is substantial con-
sensus that one needs to go beyond similarity as a
basis for postulating grouping. Thus phylogenetic
techniques often use a model of relatedness aimed
not at similarity-based grouping, but rather at creat-
ing a minimal genealogical tree. Nonetheless sim-
ilarity is a satisfying basis of comparison at more
local levels.
