Abstract 
This paper presents a cross-linguistic 
analysis of the largest dictionaries cur-
rently existing for Romanian, French, and 
German, and a new, robust and portable 
method for Dictionary Entry Parsing 
(DEP), based on Segmentation-
Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) configura-
tions. The SCD configurations are ap-
plied successively on each dictionary en-
try to identify its lexicographic segments 
(the first SCD configuration), to extract 
its sense tree (the second configuration), 
and to parse its atomic sense definitions 
(the third one). Using previous results on 
DLR (The Romanian Thesaurus ? new 
format), the present paper adapts and ap-
plies the SCD-based technology to other 
four large and complex thesauri: DAR 
(The Romanian Thesaurus ? old format), 
TLF (Le Tr?sor de la Langue Fran?aise), 
DWB (Deutsches W?rterbuch ? 
GRIMM), and GWB (G?the-
W?rterbuch). This experiment is illu-
strated on significantly large parsed en-
tries of these thesauri, and proved the fol-
lowing features: (1) the SCD-based me-
thod is a completely formal grammar-
free approach for dictionary parsing, with 
efficient (weeks-time adaptable) model-
ing through sense hierarchies and parsing 
portability for a new dictionary. (2) SCD-
configurations separate and run sequen-
tially and independently the processes of 
lexicographic segment recognition, sense 
tree extraction, and atomic definition  
 
parsing. (3) The whole DEP process with 
SCD-configurations is optimal. (4) SCD-
configurations, through sense marker 
classes and their dependency hyper-
graphs, offer an unique instrument of lex-
icon construction comparison, sense con-
cept design and DEP standardization. 
1 Introduction 
The general idea behind parsing a large dictio-
nary can be reduced to transforming a raw text 
entry into an indexable linguistic resource. Thus, 
for each dictionary entry, a structured representa-
tion of its senses has to be created, together with 
a detailed description of the entry?s form: i.e. 
morphology, syntax, orthography, phonetics, lex-
ical semantics, etymology, usage, variants etc.  
The aim of this paper is to present an efficient 
dictionary entry parsing (DEP) method, based on 
Segmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) con-
figurations (Curteanu, 2006), applied on a set of 
five large and complex dictionaries: DLR (The 
Romanian Thesaurus ? new format), DAR (The 
Romanian Thesaurus ? old format), TLF (Le 
Tr?sor de la Langue Fran?aise), DWB 
(Deutsches W?rterbuch ? GRIMM), and GWB 
(G?the-W?rterbuch).  
The paper is structured in 8 sections: Section 2 
presents the state of the art in DEP, with an em-
phasis on the comparison between the proposed 
method and other dictionary parsing strategies, 
before detailing the SCD-based proposed method 
in Section 3. The following sections present the 
application of the proposed method to the five 
dictionaries. The paper ends with a discussion on 
38
comparative results and development directions 
concerning optimality, portability, standardiza-
tion, and dictionary networks. 
2 Dictionary Entry Parsing 
Natural language text parsing is a complex 
process whose prerequisite essential stage is a 
thorough modeling of the linguistic process to be 
developed, i.e. the structures and relations aimed 
to constitute the final result of the analysis. Simi-
larly, for DEP, the semantics of the lexical struc-
tures, the sense markers, and the hierarchies (de-
pendencies) between sense structures must be 
specified.  
Standard approaches to dictionary entry pars-
ing (referred to from now on as standard DEP), 
such as the one used by (Neff and Boguraev, 
1989), the LexParse system presented in (Hauser 
and Storrer, 1993; Kammerer, 2000; Lemnitzer 
and Kunze, 2005), or lexicographic grammars, as 
those presented in (Curteanu & Amihaesei, 2004; 
Tufis et al, 1999), recognize the sense / subsense 
definitions in a strictly sequential manner, along 
with the incremental building of the entry sense 
tree. The interleaving of the two running 
processes is the main source of errors and ineffi-
ciency for the whole DEP process. 
Both the standard DEP (Figure 1) and our 
proposed method based on SCD-configurations 
(Figure 2) involve the following three running 
cycles and four essential phases for extracting the 
sense-tree structure from a dictionary:  
[A1], [B1] ? parsing the lexicographic seg-
ments of an entry; 
[A2], [B2] ? parsing the sense-description 
segment of the dictionary entry, at the level of 
explicitly defined senses, until and not including 
the contents of the atomic definitions / senses; at 
this stage, the sense-tree of the sense-description 
segment is built having (sets of) atomic senses / 
definitions in their leaf-nodes.  
[A3], [B3] ? parsing the atomic definitions / 
senses. 
Phase_1 := Sense-i Marker Recognition;  
Phase_2 := Sense-i Definition Parsing;  
Phase_3 := Attach Parsed Sense-i Definition 
  to Node-i; 
Phase_4 := Add Node-i to EntrySense-Tree. 
The parsing cycles and phases of existing ap-
proaches, called standard DEP, are summarized 
by the pseudo-code in Fig. 1, where Marker-
Number is the number of markers in the dictio-
nary-entry marker sequence and EntrySegment-
Number is the number of lexicographic segments 
of the parsed entry.

  If(Segment-s = Sense-Segment)

  Phase_1  Sense-i Marker Recognition;  
  Phase_2  Sense-i Definition Parsing;

   Phase_3  Attach Parsed Sense-i   
     Defi nition to Node-i; 
   Phase_4  Add Node-i to Entry 
     Sense Tree;

[/A2].  EndFor 
   Output: EntrySenseTree with  
   Parsed Sense Definitions  
   (only if all sense definitions are parsed). 
  Else Segment-s Parsing; 
  Continue 
[/A1]. EndFor 
 Output: Entry parsed segments, including the  
 Sense-Segment (only if all definitions in the  
 Sense-Segment are parsed). 
Fig. 1. Standard dictionary entry parsing 
The main drawback of the classical, standard 
DEP, is the embedding of the parsing cycles, 
[A1] [A2] [A3] ... [/A3] [/A2] [/A1], derived 
from the intuitive, but highly inefficient parsing 
strategy based on the general Depth-First search-
ing. After presenting the SCD-based dictionary 
parsing method, section 3.2. compares the pars-
ing cycles and phases of standard DEP to the 
ones of SCD-based DEP.  
3 Parsing with SCD Configurations  
The SCD configuration(s) method is a 
procedural, recognition-generation computa-
tional device, that is distinct from the traditional 
and cumbersome formal grammars, being able to 
successfully replace them for several tasks of 
natural language parsing, including text free 
parsing (Curteanu, 2006) and thesauri parsing 
(Curteanu et al, 2008). For SCD-based parsing, 
the semantics and the linguistic modeling of the 
text to be analyzed should be clearly specified at 
each parsing level, and implemented within the 
following components of each SCD 
configuration (hereafter, SCD-config):  
? A set of marker classes: a marker is a 
boundary for a specific linguistic category 
(e.g. A., I., 1., a)., etc.). Markers are 
joined into marker classes, with respect to 
39
their functional similarity (e.g. {A., B., C., 
?}, {1., 2., 3., ?}, {a)., b)., ?});  
? A hypergraph-like hierarchy that estab-
lishes the dependencies among the marker 
classes;  
? A searching (parsing) algorithm. 
Once an SCD configuration is defined, parsing 
with the SCD configuration implies identifying 
the markers in the text to be parsed, constructing 
the sequences of markers and categories, recog-
nizing the marked text structures (spans within 
the bounding markers) corresponding to the SCD 
configuration semantics, and classifying them 
according to the marker sequences within the 
pre-established hierarchy assigned to that SCD 
configuration. The last step settles the dependen-
cies and correlations among the parsed textual 
structures. Identifying the lexicographic seg-
ments of an entry, the syntactic and semantic 
structure of each segment, the senses, definitions 
and their corresponding markers, is the result of 
an in-depth lexical semantics analysis. Designing 
the classes and the hypergraph structure of their 
dependencies are essential cognitive aspects of 
working with SCD configurations, and need to 
be pre-established for each dictionary.  
Within the parsing process, each SCD confi-
guration, i.e. marker classes, hierarchy, and 
searching algorithm, is completely commanded 
by its attached semantics. The semantically-
driven parsing process, either for free or specia-
lized texts, consists in a number of SCD configu-
rations applied sequentially (in cascade), each 
one on a different semantic level. The semantic 
levels (each one driving an SCD configuration) 
are subsuming each other in a top-down, mono-
tonic manner, starting with the most general se-
mantics of the largest text span, until the most 
specific level.  
3.1 SCD Configurations for DEP  
The SCD-based process for DEP consists in three 
SCD configurations, applied sequentially on the 
levels and sublevels of the dictionary entry, 
where each level should be monotonic at the lex-
ical-semantics subsumption relation.  
The task of applying the SCD configurations 
to DEP requires knowing the semantics of the 
corresponding classes of sense and definition 
markers, together with their hierarchical repre-
sentation. 
The first SCD configuration (SCD-config1) is 
devoted to the task of obtaining the partition of 
the entry lexicographic segments (Hauser & 
Storrer, 1993). Since usually there are no depen-
dency relations between lexicographic segments, 
SCD-config1 is not planned to establish the de-
pendency relations (cycle [A1] in Fig. 1, or cycle 
[B1] in Fig. 2).  
The second important task of DEP is to parse 
each lexicographic segment according to its spe-
cific semantics and linguistic structure. The most 
prominent lexicographic segment of each entry is 
the sense-description one, the central operation 
being the process of extracting the sense tree 
from the segment. This is the purpose of the 
second SCD configuration (denoted 
SCD-config2), corresponding exactly to the 
DSSD parsing algorithm in (Curteanu et al, 
2008), which, for the DLR sense trees, has a pre-
cision of 91.18%. In order to refine the lexical-
semantics of primary senses, one has to descend, 
under secondary senses, into the definitions and 
definition examples, which constitute the text 
spans situated between two sequentially-related 
nodes of the parsed sense tree. This SCD confi-
guration is represented as cycle [B2] in Fig. 2. 
The third step of DEP parsing (cycle [B3] in 
Fig. 2) is represented by the configuration 
SCD-config3, needed to complete the DEP. 
SCD-config3 consists in a specific set of marker 
classes for the segmentation at dictionary defini-
tions, the hypergraph-like hierarchy of the 
classes of markers for these sense definitions, 
and the parsing algorithm to establish the depen-
dencies among atomic senses / definitions. As a 
prerequisite groundwork, an adequate modeling 
of the sense definitions is needed and the seg-
mentation of definitions is implemented as an 
essential step to establish the dependency-by-
subsumption among the sense types of the consi-
dered thesaurus. The final result of the entry 
parsing process should be the sequential applica-
tion of the SCD-config1, SCD-config2, and 
SCD-config3 configurations.  
3.2 A Structural Analysis: Standard DEP vs. 
SCD Configurations  
A pilot experiment of parsing with SCD configu-
rations was its application to the DLR thesaurus 
parsing (Curteanu et al, 2008); the process of 
sense tree building has been completely detached 
40
and extracted from the process of sense definition 
parsing. 
The sense-tree parsing with SCD-based DEP 
cycles and phases is summarized in pseudo-code 
in Fig. 2 and comparative Table 1 below.

  Segment-s Parsing; 
  If(Segment-s = Sense-Segment)  
   Standby on Sense-Segment Parsing; 
  Else Continue

 Output: Entry parsed segments, not including the  
 Sense-Segment;

  Phase_1  Sense-i Marker Recognition;  
   Assign (Unparsed) Sense-i Definition to  
   Node-i;  
  Phase_4  Add Node-i to EntrySenseTree;  
   Standby on Sense-i Definition Parsing;  
[/B2]. EndFor 
 Output: EntrySenseTree (with unparsed sense  
 definitions).  
  Node-k = Root(EntrySenseTree); 
[B3]. While not all nodes in EntrySenseTree are  
   visited  
  Phase_2  Sense-k Definition Parsing;  
   If(Success) 
  Phase_3  Attach Parsed Sense-k Definition to  
   Node-k;  
  Else Attach Sense-k Parsing Result to Node-k;  
   Node-k = getNextDepth 
   FirstNode(EntrySenseTree) 
  Continue 
[/B3]. EndWhile. 
 Output: EntrySenseTree (with parsed or unparsed  
definitions). 
 Output: Entry parsed segments, including the  
 Sense-Segment.

Table 1: Dictionary parsing phases in  
standard DEP and SCD-based DEP  
 
Table 1 presents the ordering of the dictionary 
parsing phases in the standard DEP strategy (the 
four phases are embedded) and the SCD-based 
DEP strategy (the phases are organized in a li-
nearly sequential order). 
Since the process of sense tree construction 
(cycle Phase_1 + Phase_4) has been made com-
pletely detachable from the parsing of the (atom-
ic) sense definitions (cycle Phase_2 + Phase_3), 
the whole SCD-based DEP process is much more 
efficient and robust. An efficiency feature of the 
SCD-based parsing technique is that, working 
exclusively on sense marker sequences, outputs 
of [B2] and [B3] cycles in Fig. 2 (i.e. sense trees) 
are obtained either the sense definition parsing 
process succeeds or not, either correct or not! 
These properties of the new parsing method 
with SCD configurations have been effectively 
supported by the parsing experiments on large 
Romanian, French, and German dictionaries. 
4 Romanian DLR Parsing  
The study of the application of SCD-
configuration to DEP started with the analysis of 
the DLR parsing (Curteanu et al, 2008). Fig. 3 
presents the hierarchy of SCD-config2 for DLR 
sense marker classes,  
Fig. 3. Hierarchy of DLR marker classes 
devoted to sense tree parsing. The dashed ar-
rows point to the upper or lower levels of DLR 
sense marker hierarchy, from the literal enume-
ration layer-embedded level. The continuous-
dashed arrows in Fig. 3 point downwards from 
the higher to the lower priority levels of DLR 
marker class hypergraph. Because of its special 
representation characteristics, the literal enume-
ration is illustrated on a layer attached to the hie-

rarchy level (dashed line) to which it belongs, on 
each of the sense levels.  
A detailed description of the DLR sense tree 
extraction with SCD-config2 (denoted as DSSD 
algorithm) is found in (Curteanu et al, 2008). 
4.1 DLR Parsing: Problems and Results  
The three SCD-configurations establish the de-
pendencies among DLR senses (SCD-config1-2) 
and definitions (SCD-config3). However, DLR is 
encoded by default inheritance rules of senses 
(definitions), acting on all the node levels of the 
sense / definition trees. 
The sense tree parser (output of SCD-config2) 
was tested on more than 500 dictionary entries of 
large and medium sizes. The success rate was 
91.18%, being computed as a perfect match be-
tween the output of the program and the gold 
standard. Furthermore, it is worth noting that an 
entry with only one incorrect parse (i.e. one node 
in the sense tree attached incorrectly) was consi-
dered to be erroneously parsed in its entirety, an 
approach which disregards all the other correctly 
attached nodes in that entry.  
A first source of parsing errors is the non-
monotony of the marker values: ?A. [B. missing] 
? C. ??; ?2. [instead of 1.]... 2. ??; ??a)? b) 
? c) ? b) [instead of d)] ??. Another major 
source of parsing errors comes from the inherent 
ambiguity in deciding which is the regent and 
which is the dependent (sub)sense in marker se-
quences as ?1. a) b) c) ? [?]??.  
For evaluating SCD-config3, 52 dictionary en-
tries of various sizes were used as a gold stan-
dard, totaling a number of approximately 2000 
chunks and 22,000 words. The results are given 
in Table 2. Upon further analysis of the evalua-
tion results, the most frequent errors were found 
to be due to faulty sigle (abbreviation of the 
source of examples) segmentation. A detailed 
analysis of the error types for the DLR dictionary 
is discussed in (Curteanu et al, 2009).

Correcting the acquisition of sigles leads to a 
94.43% f-measure for exact match (the number 
of correctly identified sense and definition units) 
and a 98.01% f-measure for overlap (the number 
of correctly classified words in each entry). To 
achieve the DLR parsing process completely, the 
last operation to be executed is to establish the 
dependency relations between atomic senses / 
definitions, under all the sense nodes in the com-
puted sense-tree of the entry. Currently, the DLR 
is parsed almost completely, including at atomic 
senses / definitions, the lexicographic segments 
and sense-trees being obtained with a correctness 
rate above 90% for explicitly marked sense defi-
nitions. 
5 Romanian DAR Parsing  
The structure of the main lexicographical seg-
ments in DAR is outlined below: 
I. The French Translation segment, denoted 
FreSeg, contains the French translations of the 
lemma and the main sense hierarchy of the entry 
word. The translation of the sense structure into 
Romanian and the complete description of the 
sense tree in DAR are in a subsumption relation. 
In some cases, the French translation may not 
exist for specific Romanian lemmas.  
II. The general description segment (RomSeg) 
is composed of several paragraphs and contains 
morphologic, syntactic, semantic, or usage in-
formation on the entry word. RomSeg usually 
starts with the entry word in italics (otherwise, 
the entry word occurs in the first row of the first 
paragraph). 
III. The third segment of a DAR entry, called 
SenseSeg, is the lexical-semantic description of 
the entry word. SenseSeg is the main objective of 
the lexicographic analysis of the entry parsing in 
order to obtain its sense tree. 
IV. The fourth segment of a DAR, NestSeg, 
contains one or more ?nests?, which are seg-
ments of text describing morphological, syntac-
tic, phonological, regional, etc. variants of an 
entry, sometimes with an attached description of 
the specific senses. The structure of the DAR 
nest segment is similar to that of a typical DAR 
entry, and the recursive nature of DAR entries 
comes from the sense parsing of nest segments. 
42
V. The fifth segment of DAR entries, denoted 
EtymSeg, contains etymological descriptions of 
the entry word and is introduced by an etymolo-
gy-dash (long dash ???). Among the five seg-
ments of a DAR entry, the only compulsory ones 
are FreSeg and SenseSeg. The other three seg-
ments are optional in the entry description, de-
pending on each entry word. 
5.1 DAR Marker Classes and Hierarchy 
The priority ordering of DAR marker classes is:  
1.  Capital letters (LatCapLett_Enum): A., B., ... 
2.  Capital roman numerals (LatCap-
Numb_Enum): I., II., ... 
3.  Arabic numerals (ArabNumb_Enum): 10., 20. 
These markers introduce the primary senses, in a 
similar manner to those in DLR. 
4. For introducing secondary senses, DAR uses 
the same sense markers used in DLR for defini-
tions of type MorfDef, RegDef, BoldDef, ItalDef, 
SpecDef, SpSpecDef, and DefExem, and a set of 
markers specific to DAR: ||, |, #, ?.  
5. According to the level of the lexical-semantic 
description, DAR uses literal enumeration on 
two levels: (5.a) lowercase Latin letters (LatS-
mallLett_Enum): a.), b.), ? (5.b) a LatSmal 
lLett_Enum can have another enumeration, using 
lowercase Greek letters (GreSmallLett_Enum): 
?.), ?.), ?.), ? 
The hierarchies for sense markers in DAR are 
given in Fig. 4. 
 
5.2 Special problems in DAR parsing 
A first difficulty for parsing the DAR lexico-
graphic segments is the occurrence of the 
New_Paragraph (NewPrg). For NewPrg marker  
 
Fig. 4: Dependency hypergraph for DAR 
 
recognition we used an implicit level of enumera-
tion, LatSmaNum_Enum discriminating the cases 
when NewPrg is (or not) accompanied by anoth-
er type of DAR sense marker.  
The second difficult problem in DAR parsing 
is the process of refining the NewPrg marker 
with literal enumerations (LatSmallLett_Enum), 
which can be in turn refined by an implicit enu-
meration using NewPrg. This has been solved by 
interpreting the sense levels for enumerations 
according to their context.  
Using SCD configurations, we have parsed 37 
DAR entries of large and medium sizes. The re-
sults of the DAR parsing have been evaluated 
manually, and we estimated the parsing precision 
as really promising, taking into account the diffi-
cult problems raised by DAR. The lack of a gold 
standard for DAR entries did not allow perform-
ing an automatic evaluation at this moment.

6 French TLF Parsing  
The French TLF, a very well-organized and 
structured thesaurus, provides both similarities 
and distinctive characteristics in comparison to 
the Romanian DLR. The structure of TLF lex-
icographic segments, obtained with the 
SCD-config1, is relatively simple. A TLF entry 
commences with the sense-description segment, 
optionally (but very frequently) followed by a 
package of ?final? segments, introduced by spe-
cific labels, as in the pattern:

As one may notice, some final segments can 
enclose particular sense descriptions, similarly to 
those met in the proper sense-description seg-
ment. The sense markers in TLF resemble to 
those in DLR, but there are also significant dif-
ferences. The dependency hypergraph of the 
TLF marker classes is the following:

Cross-linguistic hints involving TLF entry 
parsing with SCD configurations: (a) A new 
sense marker (compared to DLR) is ??? (inherit-
ance- dash), aiming to signal the presence of an 
inherited sense. (b) When ??? occurs after anoth-
er TLF marker, the ??? role is to inherit a parent 
sense (either regent or not) from the sense-tree. 
(c) When ??? begins at new paragraph (NewPrg), 
its role is of a intermediary subsense, inheriting 
the meaning of the regent (sub)sense. 
(d) Another new TLF marker is ??1., ?2., ?? 
(indexed, small red-ball), defining the new TLF 
sense concept: Indexed Examples to Definitions 
for the whole entry (denoted IdxDefExem). 
(e) The literal enumeration with Latin small let-
ters (LatSmaLett_Enum) is refined with Greek 
small letters (GreSmaLett_Enum). (f) In TLF, 
only the filled diamond ??? marker is present (as 
secondary sense); the empty diamond ??? is 
missing. (g) Some primary senses (?I.?, ?A.?) in 
44
TLF receive reversed priorities (Fig. 5) in the 
marker class hierarchy as compared to DLR.  
6.1 TLF Parsing Results  
For TLF, we processed 31 significant entries 
(TLFi, 2010) of medium and large dimensions 
(entries of 5 pages each, A4 format, in average) 
with the parser based on SCD configurations. 
The parsing results have been evaluated manual-
ly, the correctness rate being above 90%. One of 
the reasons of these very promising results for 
TLF parsing may be the regularity and standar-
dization of the TLF entry texts. An automatic, 
precise evaluation of the SCD-based parser was 
not possible since we are missing currently a 
gold-corpus of TLF entries.

7 Lexicographic Segments and Sense 
Markers in German DWB and GWB  
The German DWB entries comprise a complex 
structure of the lexicographic segments, which 
provide a non-uniform and non-unitary composi-
tion (Das Woerterbuch-Netz, 2010). One special 
feature is that DWB and GWB lexicographic 
segments are composed of two parts: a first (op-
tional) root-sense subsegment, and the segment 
body, which contain the explicit sense markers, 
easily recognizable. For DWB, the parsing of 
lexicographic segments is not at all a comfortable 
task since they are defined by three distinct 
means:  
(A) After the root-sense of a DWB entry, or 
after the root-sense of a lexicographic segment, 
(a list of) italicized-and-spaced key-words are 
placed to constitute the label of the lexicographic 
segment that follows. Samples of such key-word 
labels for DWB lexicographic segments are: 
?Form, Ausbildung und Ursprung?, ?Formen?, 
?Ableitungen?, 
?Verwandtschaft?,?Verwandtschaft und Form?, 
?Formelles und Etymologisches?, ?Gebrauch?, 
?Herkunft?, ?Grammatisches?, etc., or, for DWB 
sense-description segment: ?Bedeutung und 
Gebrauch? (or just ?Bedeutung?). In the example 
below, they are marked in grey.

(B) The second way to specify the DWB cur-
rent lexicographic segments is to use their labels 
as key-words immediately after the primary 
sense markers. 
(C) The third (and most frequent) way to iden-
tify the lexical description segment(s) of a DWB 
entry is simply the lack of a segment label at the 
beginning of the sense description segment. By 
default, after the entry root-sense segment (which 
can be reduced to the Latin translation of the 
German lemma) the sense-description segment 
comes, without any ?Bedeutung? label, introduc-
ing explicit sense markers and definitions.  
7.1 German DWB and GWB Dependency 
Hypergraphs. Parsing Results  
Without coming into details (see the marker class 
dependency hypergraphs in Fig.6 and Fig.7), one 
can say with a good measure of truth that a gen-
eral resemblance hold between DAR

The sense markers in DWB are usual, with the 
remark that sense refinement by literal enumera-
tion is realized on three levels:

Lett_Enum ( ?), ?), ?), and GreDoubleSma-
Lett_Enum ( ??), ??), ?).

A number of 17 very large DWB entries have 
been parsed only with SCD-config1 and SCD-
config2. We appreciate on this small but signifi-
cant excerpt of DWB entries that parsing of the 
sense description segment at sense trees is per-
formed with a high precision, but delimitation of 
the lexicographic (sub-)segments and labels is a 
more difficult problem. The lack of a DWB entry 
gold corpus did not allow a precise, automated 
evaluation of the parser.  
8 Directions: Optimal Lexicon Design, 
Standardization, Lexicon Networks  
The special features of parsing with SCD confi-
gurations (SCD-configs) are: ? SCD-configs is a 
completely formal grammar-free approach which 
involves simple, efficient (weeks-time adapta-
ble), thus portable modeling and programs. ? In 
all currently existing DEP methods, the sense 
tree construction of each entry is, more or less, 
recursively embedded and mixed within the defi-
nition parsing procedures. ? SCD-configs pro-
vides a lexical-semantics refinement level on 
each SCD-config. ? SCD-configs separate and 
run sequentially, on independent levels (viz. con-
figurations), the processes of lexicographic seg-
ment recognition, sense tree extraction, and 
atomic definition parsing. ? This makes the 
whole DEP process with SCD-configs to be op-
timal. ? The sense marker classes and their de-
pendency hypergraphs, specific to each thesau-
rus, offer an unique instrument of lexicon con-
46
struction comparison, sense concept design and 
standardization. With the SCD parsing technique, 
one can easily compare the sense categories, 
their marking devices, the complexity and recur-
siveness measure of the sense dependency 
hypergraphs for each thesaurus.  
The cross-linguistic analysis of the five large 
thesauri showed the necessity of a careful lexi-
cal-semantics modeling of each dictionary. 
Equally important, many semantic and lexico-
graphic concepts such as sense markers and defi-
nitions, (indexed) examples to definitions, sense 
and source references etc. can be similar, adapta-
ble, and transferable between corresponding 
SCD-configurations of different thesauri.  
The SCD-configs analysis pointed out the 
need of a more general and adequate terminology 
for the lexical-semantics notions. E.g., compar-
ing the Romanian and French thesauri with the 
German ones, we decided that, while preserving 
the definition type labels MorfDef, DefExem, 
SpecDef and SpSpecDef, we should change the 
RegDef into GlossDef, BoldDef into IdiomDef, 
ItalDef into CollocDef, and add the TLF IdxDe-
fExem (an indexed DefExem) to the sense con-
cept set.  
The future experiments will continue with new 
thesauri parsing: Russian, Spanish, Italian, but 
the true challenge shall be oriented towards Chi-
nese / Japanese thesauri, aiming to establish a 
thorough lexical-semantics comparison and a 
language-independent, portable DEP technology 
based on SCD configurations. A further devel-
opment would be to align the Romanian thesauri 
sense and definition types to TEI P5 standards 
(XCES, 2007), and to design an optimal and 
cross-linguistic compatible network of Romanian 
electronic dictionaries, similar to a very good 
project of dictionary network, i.e. the German 
Woerterbuch-Netz (with links to TLFi entries 
too), whose twelve component lexicons include 
DWB and GWB.
