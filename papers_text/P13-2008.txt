Abstract
Mismatch between queries and documents
is a key issue for the web search task. In
order to narrow down such mismatch, in
this paper, we present an in-depth inves-
tigation on adapting a paraphrasing tech-
nique to web search from three aspect-
s: a search-oriented paraphrasing mod-
el; an NDCG-based parameter optimiza-
tion algorithm; an enhanced ranking mod-
el leveraging augmented features comput-
ed on paraphrases of original queries. Ex-
periments performed on the large scale
query-document data set show that, the
search performance can be significantly
improved, with +3.28% and +1.14% ND-
CG gains on dev and test sets respectively.
1 Introduction
Paraphrasing is an NLP technique that generates
alternative expressions to convey the same mean-
ing of the input text in different ways. Researcher-
s have made great efforts to improve paraphrasing
from different perspectives, such as paraphrase ex-
traction (Zhao et al, 2007), paraphrase generation
(Quirk et al, 2004), model optimization (Zhao et
al., 2009) and etc. But as far as we know, none of
previous work has explored the impact of using a
well designed paraphrasing engine for web search
ranking task specifically.
In web search, mismatches between queries and
their relevant documents are usually caused by ex-
pressing the same meaning in different natural lan-
guage ways. E.g., X is the author of Y and Y was
written by X have identical meaning in most cas-
es, but they are quite different in literal sense. The
capability of paraphrasing is just right to alleviate
such issues. Motivated by this, this paper presents
? This work has been done while the author was visiting
Microsoft Research Asia.
an in-depth study on adapting paraphrasing to web
search. First, we propose a search-oriented para-
phrasing model, which includes specifically de-
signed features for web queries that can enable a
paraphrasing engine to learn preferences on dif-
ferent paraphrasing strategies. Second, we opti-
mize the parameters of the paraphrasing model ac-
cording to the Normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (NDCG) score, by leveraging the minimum
error rate training (MERT) algorithm (Och, 2003).
Third, we propose an enhanced ranking model by
using augmented features computed on paraphras-
es of original queries.
Many query reformulation approaches have
been proposed to tackle the query-document mis-
match issue, which can be generally summarized
as query expansion and query substitution. Query
expansion (Baeza-Yates, 1992; Jing and Croft,
1994; Lavrenko and Croft, 2001; Cui et al, 2002;
Yu et al, 2003; Zhang and Yu, 2006; Craswell and
Szummer, 2007; Elsas et al, 2008; Xu et al, 2009)
adds new terms extracted from different sources to
the original query directly; while query substitu-
tion (Brill and Moore, 2000; Jones et al, 2006;
Guo et al, 2008; Wang and Zhai, 2008; Dang
and Croft, 2010) uses probabilistic models, such
as graphical models, to predict the sequence of
rewritten query words to form a new query. Com-
paring to these works, our paraphrasing engine al-
ters queries in a similar way to statistical machine
translation, with systematic tuning and decoding
components. Zhao et al (2009) proposes an uni-
fied paraphrasing framework that can be adapted
to different applications using different usability
models. Our work can be seen as an extension a-
long this line of research, by carrying out in-depth
study on adapting paraphrasing to web search.
Experiments performed on the large scale data
set show that, by leveraging additional matching
features computed on query paraphrases, signif-
icant NDCG gains can be achieved on both dev
41
(+3.28%) and test (+1.14%) sets.
2 Paraphrasing for Web Search
In this section, we first summarize our paraphrase
extraction approaches, and then describe our para-
phrasing engine for the web search task from three
aspects, including: 1) a search-oriented paraphras-
ing model; 2) an NDCG-based parameter opti-
mization algorithm; 3) an enhanced ranking model
with augmented features that are computed based
on the extra knowledge provided by the paraphrase
candidates of the original queries.
2.1 Paraphrase Extraction
Paraphrases can be mined from various resources.
Given a bilingual corpus, we use Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005)?s pivot-based approach to
extract paraphrases. Given a monolingual cor-
pus, Lin and Pantel (2001)?s method is used to ex-
tract paraphrases based on distributional hypoth-
esis. Additionally, human annotated data can al-
so be used as high-quality paraphrases. We use
Miller (1995)?s approach to extract paraphrases
from the synonym dictionary of WordNet. Word
alignments within each paraphrase pair are gener-
ated using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).
2.2 Search-Oriented Paraphrasing Model
Similar to statistical machine translation (SMT),
given an input query Q, our paraphrasing engine
generates paraphrase candidates1 based on a linear
model.
Q? = argmax
Q??H(Q)
P (Q?|Q)
= argmax
Q??H(Q)
M?
m=1
?mhm(Q,Q?)
H(Q) is the hypothesis space containing all para-
phrase candidates of Q, hm is the mth feature
function with weight ?m, Q? denotes one candi-
date. In order to enable our paraphrasing model
to learn the preferences on different paraphrasing
strategies according to the characteristics of web
queries, we design search-oriented features2 based
on word alignments within Q and Q?, which can
be described as follows:
1We apply CYK algorithm (Chappelier and Rajman,
1998), which is most commonly used in SMT (Chiang,
2005), to generating paraphrase candidates.
2Similar features have been demonstrated effective in
(Jones et al, 2006). But we use SMT-like model to gener-
ate query reformulations.
? Word Addition feature hWADD(Q,Q?),
which is defined as the number of words in
the paraphrase candidate Q? without being
aligned to any word in the original query Q.
? Word Deletion feature hWDEL(Q,Q?),
which is defined as the number of words in
the original query Q without being aligned
to any word in the paraphrase candidate Q?.
? Word Overlap feature hWO(Q,Q?), which is
defined as the number of word pairs that align
identical words between Q and Q?.
? Word Alteration feature hWA(Q,Q?), which
is defined as the number of word pairs that
align different words between Q and Q?.
? Word Reorder feature hWR(Q,Q?), which is
modeled by a relative distortion probability
distribution, similar to the distortion model in
(Koehn et al, 2003).
? Length Difference feature hLD(Q,Q?),
which is defined as |Q?| ? |Q|.
? Edit Distance feature hED(Q,Q?), which is
defined as the character-level edit distance
between Q and Q?.
Besides, a set of traditional SMT features
(Koehn et al, 2003) are also used in our paraphras-
ing model, including translation probability, lex-
ical weight, word count, paraphrase rule count3,
and language model feature.
2.3 NDCG-based Parameter Optimization
We utilize minimum error rate training (MERT)
(Och, 2003) to optimize feature weights of the
paraphrasing model according to NDCG. We de-
fine D as the entire document set. R is a rank-
ing model4 that can rank documents in D based
on each input query. {Qi,DLabeli }Si=1 is a human-
labeled development set. Qi is the ith query and
DLabeli ? D is a subset of documents, in which
the relevance between Qi and each document is
labeled by human annotators.
MERT is used to optimize feature weights
of our linear-formed paraphrasing model. For
3Paraphrase rule count is the number of rules that are used
to generate paraphrase candidates.
4The ranking model R (Liu et al, 2007) uses matching
features computed based on original queries and documents.
42
each query Qi in {Qi}Si=1, we first generate N-
best paraphrase candidates {Qji}Nj=1, and com-
pute NDCG score for each paraphrase based on
documents ranked by the ranker R and labeled
documents DLabeli . We then optimize the feature
weights according to the following criterion:
??M1 = argmin
?M1
{
S?
i=1
Err(DLabeli , Q?i;?M1 ,R)}
The objective of MERT is to find the optimal fea-
ture weight vector ??M1 that minimizes the error cri-
terionErr according to the NDCG scores of top-1
paraphrase candidates.
The error function Err is defined as:
Err(DLabeli , Q?i;?M1 ,R) = 1?N (DLabeli , Q?i,R)
where Q?i is the best paraphrase candidate accord-
ing to the paraphrasing model based on the weight
vector ?M1 , N (DLabeli , Q?i,R) is the NDCG score
of Q?i computed on the documents ranked byR of
Q?i and labeled document set DLabeli of Qi. The
relevance rating labeled by human annotators can
be represented by five levels: ?Perfect?, ?Excel-
lent?, ?Good?, ?Fair?, and ?Bad?. When comput-
ing NDCG scores, these five levels are commonly
mapped to the numerical scores 31, 15, 7, 3, 0 re-
spectively.
2.4 Enhanced Ranking Model
In web search, the key objective of the ranking
model is to rank the retrieved documents based on
their relevance to a given query.
Given a query Q and its retrieved document set
D = {DQ}, for each DQ ? D, we use the fol-
lowing ranking model to compute their relevance,
which is formulated as a weighted combination of
matching features:
R(Q,DQ) =
K?
k=1
?kFk(Q,DQ)
F = {F1, ..., FK} denotes a set of matching fea-
tures that measure the matching degrees between
Q and DQ, Fk(Q,DQ) ? F is the kth matching
feature, ?k is its corresponding feature weight.
How to learn the weight vector {?k}Kk=1 is a s-
tandard learning-to-rank task. The goal of learning
is to find an optimal weight vector {??k}Kk=1, such
that for any two documentsDiQ ? D andDjQ ? D,
the following condition holds:
R(Q,DiQ) > R(Q,DjQ)? rDiQ > rDjQ
where rDQ denotes a numerical relevance rating
labeled by human annotators denoting the rele-
vance between Q and DQ.
As the ultimate goal of improving paraphrasing
is to help the search task, we present a straight-
forward but effective method to enhance the rank-
ing modelR described above, by leveraging para-
phrase candidates of the original query as the extra
knowledge to compute matching features.
Formally, given a query Q and its N -best para-
phrase candidates {Q?1, ..., Q?N}, we enrich the o-
riginal feature vector F to {F,F1, ...,FN} for Q
and DQ, where all features in Fn have the same
meanings as they are in F, however, their feature
values are computed based onQ?n andDQ, instead
of Q and DQ. In this way, the paraphrase candi-
dates act as hidden variables and expanded match-
ing features between queries and documents, mak-
ing our ranking model more tunable and flexible
for web search.
3 Experiment
3.1 Data and Metric
Paraphrase pairs are extracted as we described in
Section 2.1. The bilingual corpus includes 5.1M
sentence pairs from the NIST 2008 constrained
track of Chinese-to-English machine translation
task. The monolingual corpus includes 16.7M
queries from the log of a commercial search en-
gine. Human annotated data contains 0.3M syn-
onym pairs from WordNet dictionary. Word align-
ments of each paraphrase pair are trained by
GIZA++. The language model is trained based
on a portion of queries, in which the frequency of
each query is higher than a predefined threshold,
5. The number of paraphrase pairs is 58M. The
minimum length of paraphrase rule is 1, while the
maximum length of paraphrase rule is 5.
We randomly select 2, 838 queries from the log
of a commercial search engine, each of which at-
tached with a set of documents that are annotat-
ed with relevance ratings described in Section 2.3.
We use the first 1, 419 queries together with their
annotated documents as the development set to
tune paraphrasing parameters (as we discussed in
Section 2.3), and use the rest as the test set. The
ranking model is trained based on the develop-
ment set. NDCG is used as the evaluation metric
of the web search task.

3.2 Baseline Systems
The baselines of the paraphrasing and the ranking
model are described as follows:
The paraphrasing baseline is denoted as BL-
Para, which only uses traditional SMT features
described at the end of Section 2.2. Weights are
optimized by MERT using BLEU (Papineni et al,
2002) as the error criterion. Development data are
generated based on the English references of NIST
2008 constrained track of Chinese-to-English ma-
chine translation task. We use the first reference
as the source, and the rest as its paraphrases.
The ranking model baseline (Liu et al, 2007) is
denoted as BL-Rank, which only uses matching
features computed based on original queries and
different meta-streams of web pages, including
URL, page title, page body, meta-keywords, meta-
description and anchor texts. The feature function-
s we use include unigram/bigram/trigram BM25
and original/normalized Perfect-Match. The rank-
ing model is learned based on SVM rank toolkit
(Joachims, 2006) with default parameter setting.
3.3 Impacts of Search-Oriented Features
We first evaluate the effectiveness of the search-
oriented features. To do so, we add these features
into the paraphrasing model baseline, and denote it
as BL-Para+SF, whose weights are optimized in
the same way with BL-Para. The ranking model
baseline BL-Rank is used to rank the documents.
We then compare the NDCG@1 scores of the best
documents retrieved using either original query, or
query paraphrases generated by BL-Para and BL-
Para+SF respectively, and list comparison results
in Table 1, where Cand@1 denotes the best para-
phrase candidate generated by each paraphrasing
model.
Test Set
BL-Para BL-Para+SF
Original Query Cand@1 Cand@1
27.28% 26.44% 26.53%
Table 1: Impacts of search-oriented features.
From Table 1, we can see, even using the best
query paraphrase, its corresponding NDCG score
is still lower than the NDCG score of the original
query. This performance dropping makes sense,
as changing user queries brings the risks of query
drift. When adding search-oriented features in-
to the baseline, the performance changes little, as
these two models are optimized based on BLEU
score only, without considering characteristics of
mismatches in search.
3.4 Impacts of Optimization Algorithm
We then evaluate the impact of our NDCG-based
optimization method. We add the optimization al-
gorithm described in Section 2.3 into BL-Para+SF,
and get a paraphrasing model BL-Para+SF+Opt.
The ranking model baseline BL-Rank is used.
Similar to the experiment in Table 1, we compare
the NDCG@1 scores of the best documents re-
trieved using query paraphrases generated by BL-
Para+SF and BL-Para+SF+Opt respectively, with
results shown in Table 2.
Test Set
BL-Para+SF BL-Para+SF+Opt
Original Query Cand@1 Cand@1
27.28% 26.53% 27.06%(+0.53%)
Table 2: Impacts of NDCG-based optimization.
Table 2 indicates that, by leveraging NDCG as
the error criterion for MERT, search-oriented fea-
tures benefit more (+0.53% NDCG) in selecting
the best query paraphrase from the whole para-
phrasing search space. The improvement is statis-
tically significant (p < 0.001) by t-test (Smucker
et al, 2007). The quality of the top-1 paraphrase
generated by BL-Para+SF+Opt is very close to the
original query.
3.5 Impacts of Enhanced Ranking Model
We last evaluate the effectiveness of the en-
hanced ranking model. The ranking model base-
line BL-Rank only uses original queries to com-
pute matching features between queries and docu-
ments; while the enhanced ranking model, denot-
ed as BL-Rank+Para, uses not only the original
query but also its top-1 paraphrase candidate gen-
erated by BL-Para+SF+Opt to compute augment-
ed matching features described in Section 2.4.
Dev Set
NDCG@1 NDCG@5
BL-Rank 25.31% 33.76%
BL-Rank+Para 28.59%(+3.28%) 34.25%(+0.49%)
Test Set
NDCG@1 NDCG@5
BL-Rank 27.28% 34.79%
BL-Rank+Para 28.42%(+1.14%) 35.68%(+0.89%)
Table 3: Impacts of enhanced ranking model.
From Table 3, we can see that NDCG@k (k =
1, 5) scores of BL-Rank+Para outperforms BL-
Rank on both dev and test sets. T-test shows that
44
the improvement is statistically significant (p <
0.001). Such end-to-end NDCG improvements
come from the extra knowledge provided by the
hidden paraphrases of original queries. This nar-
rows down the query-document mismatch issue to
a certain extent.
4 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we present an in-depth study on us-
ing paraphrasing for web search, which pays close
attention to various aspects of the application in-
cluding choice of model and optimization tech-
nique. In the future, we will compare and com-
bine paraphrasing with other query reformulation
techniques, e.g., pseudo-relevance feedback (Yu et
al., 2003) and a conditional random field-based ap-
proach (Guo et al, 2008).
