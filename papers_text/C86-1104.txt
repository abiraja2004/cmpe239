1. The Data  
The S'hakespgare Dt'citbnar~/ (SHAD) project has 
been using structured atabases ince 1983. The system is 
implemented on a PRIME 250-II computer using standard 
CODASYL--DBMS software and related tools. The project 
has been able to draw on a vast repository of computerized 
material dealing with Shakespeare and the English lexicon. 
Initially, it was part of the "Sonderforschungsbereich I00
Elektronische Sprachforschung" sponsored on the national 
level by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The 
research team has been directed by Marvin Spevack and H. 
Joachim Neuhaus, now both at Miinster, and Thomas 
Finkenstaedt, now at Augsburg. Spevack's O'oraplete and 
Syateraah'c ~oncordanoe to the Works o/ ,~hakospeare 
(Hildesheim and New York, 1968-1978) and Finkenstaedt's 
Ohronalogt~al En\]h)h Dichonarj/ (Heidelberg, 1970), both in 
machine readable form, were used in a computer-assisted 
lemmatization procedure (Spevack, Neuhaus, and Finken- 
staedt 1974). 
A chronologically arranged dictionary, where entries 
are sorted according to the year of first occurrence, makes 
it possible to "stop" the development of the recorded 
English vocabulary at any desired moment and to compare, 
for instance, Shakespeare's vocabulary with the corpus of 
English words recorded up to 1623, when the F, ist Fohb 
appeared (Neuhaus 1978). The set of words in Shakespeare 
can be compared with the complement set of words 
available in Elizabethan English, but not attested in 
Shakespeare's works. In this way there is a systematic 
integration into the total vocabulary. As a result, our 
database model can easily be expanded or transfered to 
cover larger or different vocabularies. 
In order to present the complete Shakespearean 
vocabulary and to disengage SHAD from dependence on a 
single edition of Shakespeare, the data were expanded to 
include all :Jtage directions and speech-prefixes in all 
quartos up to and including the F,'r,,t Foho (Volume VII of 
the ~omple~e and o?yaJ!emait~ Ctoncordance to the Works 
o/ S'hakesI, eare ), and the "bad" quartos (Volume VIII). 
Volume IX presents all substantive variants, producing a 
composite Shakespearean vocabulary in modern and 
eventually old spelling. 
In analysing this material a strict differentiation 
between vocabulary level and text level has been observed. 
Further data-preparation on the vocabulary level 
concentrated on formal properties of Shakespearean 
lemmata, such as morphological structure, or etymological 
background. There is a complete morphology for all lemmata 
(ca. 20,000 records), which gives detailed structural 
descriptions of derivations, compounds, and other 
combinations, as well as all inflected word-forms, as they 
occur in the text. The etymological data include word 
histories and loan relations, again supplemented by 
chronological data. Content-oriented criteria were used in a 
taxonomic lassification of all lemmata (Spevack 1977). On 
the whole, there are more than thirty fields of information 
in the original emma-record file. For the multidimensional 
analysis and presentation of these resources it seemed 
natural to use database concepts. 
Due to a special intervention of the Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft and the support of the Ministry, 
which we both gratefully acknowledge, we could implement 
our first database in 1983 on a newly installed PRIME 
250-II computer. The PRIME DBMS software, which we 
use, is actually one of the first commercial products which 
closely adhered to the CODASYL network data model. 
The design started with a database schema for 
Shakespearean word-formation and etymology. Since then 
the system has grown steadily including now a thesaurus 
structure and a link to the text itself. The database is 
accessed in batch mode u:~zing the FORTRAN and COBOL 
interfaces, and interactively with the VISTA query language 
and report generator. Of course, in a first implementation 
not only the database schema itself, but the preparation of 
files, and the programming of the database creation job have 
to be carried out. The first word-formation database was 
established in three separate steps. The total time needed 
to complete the job was about 17 hours. Physical design is 
especially important in large databases. Our Miinster team 
was interested in that aspect from the very beginning (DSge 
1984). 
2. Prelirainary Design Considerations 
Linguists and lexicographers are latecomers to the 
field of database applications. Database software has been 
available since the early 1960's. The early 1970's brought a 
wide variety of commercial products and a consolidation on 
the conceptual side, which ultimately led to standardization, 
design philosophies, and specifications of "normal forms". At 
that time lexicographers still used the concept of an archive 
when talking about new technologies, uch as Barnart (1973), 
Chapman (1973), and Lehmann (1973) at the 1972 
International Oon/grence on Le$1~ojzraphy in EnC/tsh. 
Similarly, in the late 1970'% we witnessed preparations for a 
Stanford Computer Archive of Language Materials. There is 
nothing wrong with the idea of an archive. But a database is
441 
something different. By now, the expression "database" 
should only be used as a technical term. Perhaps "data 
bank" may be used instead of "database" when talking about 
files of data, or archives in a conventional sense. The 
As~oosal:an /or lh'terary and .L:nym'~hv Oorayult'ny may 
have had this clarification in mind when naming its specialist 
group "Structured Data Bases". 
Although hierarchical data models and network 
models had been available since the early 1960s, and 
relational architectures since the early 1970s (Codd 1970), 
software implementations were not generally accessible in 
university computing eentres due to high cost, and lack of 
special support. Although the Mfinster computing centre 
had the hierarchical IMS software, a product of IBM, it was 
not made available for our project. Looking back from today, 
that may not have been a handicap for at least two reasons: 
lexical relationships are only rarely hierarchical in a natural 
sense, and, more importantly, hierarchical systems do not 
have a common standard. There is no migration path from 
one software product to another. Since a Shakespeare 
database will have a rather long life cycle, and was meant o 
be a model for similar projects, the requirement of a 
standard model seemed to be imperative. The process of 
standardization has been proceeding more rapidly for the 
CODASYL network model than for any other architecture. 
In the early 1980s there was just this model that fulfilled 
our requirements, and this is basically true even today. 
Beginning with the early 1980'$ lexical symposia and 
conferences had an ample share of papers reporting on 
ongoin/~ research which used the database concept in a 
variety of ways. In 1981 Na~ao et al reported on "An 
Attempt to Computerize Dictionary Data Bases" (198~). At 
the same conference a University of Bonn group (Brustkern 
and Hess 1982) presented "The BonnIex Lexicon System", 
which two years later evolved into a "Cumulated Word Data 
Base for the German Language" \[Brustkern and Schulze 
1983). A list of similar projects could easily be extended. 
One might have expected that the logical design of lexical 
databases would have built on structural ~ where 
we typically find entities and relationships, and in general, 
set theoretic notions, which can directly be translated into 
conceptual data-structures. 
Surprisingly, in many designs, linguistic considerations 
did not seem to have played a major role. Instead, the 
authors simulate conventional lay-out and typesetting 
arrangements of printed dictionaries. An example is the 
widespread ictionary usage to print one "Headword" in bold 
type and then use special symbols, such as the tilde, to 
refer to the headword, or parts of it, thus saving space for 
the treatment of further lexical items with the same 
spelling. Nagao et al (1982} very faithfully transfered this 
and other lay-out details into their design. But should a 
conventional "Headword" and its dependencies be a serious 
candidate for a database ntity? Are the reasons that led 
dictionary publishers to accept certain lay-out techniques at 
all relevant for an electronic database? These questions 
seem not to have been raised. The design seems to have

become a paradigm case of an imitation design, where a new 
technology replicates design features of an older technology. 
The basic misunderstanding is the false identification of a 
mere presentation i a printed dictionary with an underlying 
lexical information structure. 
If the "Headword" is not a relevant database ntity, 
which entity should be taken instead? There is only one 
serious candidate: the lemma. The lemma is a well defined 
linguistic notion. It is also weI\[ known in computational work 
due to various automatic or semi-automatic lemmatization 
algorithms. It is an abstract notion in the sense that printed 
dictionaries and database systems need a lemma-name to 
refer to it. Language specific conventions usually govern the 
choice of a lemma-name. Latin verbs, for example, are 
customarily lemmatized using the first person singular 
present form as lamina-name. A \[emma is the set of all its 
inflected word-forms. It thus comprises a complete 
inflectional paradigm. Some lemmata have defective 
paradigms or suppletive paradigms. Conventional dictionaries 
quite often include paradigmatic information in their front 
matter. The user has to relate specific cases to these 
examples. A database can relate these explicitly. A natural 
way to do this is by a one-to-many relationship between 
lemma and word-form. In an author dictionary word-forms 
will be further related to the text, and its internal structure. 
A machine-readable dictionary is just a starting 
point for a structured lexical database. \[n the Bonn "Word 
Data Base for the German Language" (Brustkern and 
Schulze 1983b} there is but one database ntity, "Lexical 
Entry", which seems to correspond to the lemma rather 
than to a "Headword". The authors speak about the 
"microstructure" and the "macrostructure" in respect to 
"Lexical Entries", but only the former is discussed in detail. 
The later is only mentioned once: "Special characteristics of
the macrostructure (other than alphabetical order} are to be 
made explicit in the logical structure of the data base" 
(Brustkern and Schulze 1983b}. "Macrostructure" is rarely 
visible in a conventional alphabetic dictionary, although we 
are used to "synonyms" and "antonyms", dictionary "senses", 
and labels that identify technical jargon, or special 
terminologies in individual dictionary entries. In the design 
of a lexical database it is useful to make these various 
relations between lemmata explicit. In this manner a user 
gets more information than by consulting a printed 
dictionary. The information he gets is related and structured 
in unexpected ways. 
3. A Sample Schema 
There are various ways to approach the problem of 
schema design. For the 5'habe~peare Diits'anarj~ Morphology 
Database, now an integrated part of the overall architecture, 
both object-class methods and query-assertion methods 
lead to the current schema (cf. Figure 1). There are four 
base object-classes (entities}: lemmata, segments, 
allamoryh,~, and raaryheme.~ having cardinality values 
between 2,500 and 40,000 records. Queries were to allow for 
a direct retrieval on three levels: the conventional level of 
the lemma, the level of allomorphs, and the morphemic 
level. This i:~ achieved by a virtual record, defined as a 
subschema (cf. Figure 2}. In this way the database design 
mirrors a structural morphological analysis directly. The 
concept of a moryho/a~7#~a/ /amt/jf defined as a set of 
lemmata which has at least one morpheme in common is 
thus immediately accessible for database queries. 
The ultimately Latin prefix { IN-  } has, for example, 
database links to allomorphs uch as { im- } in the lemma 
impure, { il- } in the lemma illegitimate, or { it-  } in the 
lemma irregular. In Shakespeare's vocabulary there are 
almost 200 lemmata which belong to this { IN'- } family. A 
statistical survey of morphological families in Shakespeare, 
reveals characteristic "family types". Since morphological 
descriptions are directly accessible for a study of patterns 
such as nominal compounds, conversions, or derivations, 
listings of morphologically similar lemmata supplement family

listings in a study of the morphological articulation of 
Shakespeare's vocabulary. The database has access to 
various additional and specialized kinds of morphological 
information such sound symbolism, popular etymology, or 
contamination. Furthermore, morphological information is by 
design linked with etymological information. Morphological 
families which are etymologically related can be grouped 
together under one etymon. One example for such an 
etymological grouping is given in Figure 4. The phenomenon 
of etymologically homogeneous or disparate word-formation, 
which has traditionally been of some interest in 
Shakespearean studies czn be analysed directly. These 
materials are currently being prepared for the forthcoming 
first volume of SHAD. 
Any lexical database design should account for 
external inks with other lexical databases (Neuhaus 1985). 
Here again, a common standard is essential The /grama 
retard is a natural interface in these external relations. 
Standardization of the lemma concept may therefore be a 
first step for systematic database connections.
