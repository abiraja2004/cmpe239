Developing more shareable resources to support natural lan- 
guage analysis will make it easier and cheaper to create new 
language processing applications and to support research in 
computational linguistics. One natural candidate for such a 
resource is a broad-coverage dictionary, since the work re- 
quired to create such a dictionary is large but there is general 
agreement on at least some of the information to be recorded 
for each word. The Linguistic Data Consortium has begun an 
effort o create several such lexical resources, under the rubric 
"COMLEX" (COMmon LEXicon); one of these projects is 
the COMLEX Syntax Project. 
The goal of the COMLEX Syntax Project is to create a 
moderately-broad-coverage shareable dictionary containing 
the syntactic features of English words,intended for automatic 
language analysis. We are initially aiming for a dictionary of 
35,000 to 40,000 base forms, although this of course may be 
enlarged if the initial effort is positively received. The dictio- 
nary should include detailed syntactic specifications, particu- 
larly for subcategofization; ur intent is to provide sufficient 
detail so that the information required by a number of major 
English analyzers can be automatically derived from the infor- 
mation we provide. As with other Linguistic Data Consortium 
resources, our intent is to provide a lexicon available with- 
out license constraint to all Consortium members. Finally, 
our goal is to provide an initial lexicon relatively quickly 
within about a year, funding permitting. This implies a cer- 
tain flexibility, where some of the features will probably be 
changed and refined as the coding is taking place. 
1. Some COMLEX History 
There is a long history of trying to design shareable or 
"polytheoretic" lexicons and interchange formats for lexicons. 
There has also been substantial work on adapting machine- 
readable versions of conventional dictionaries for automated 
language analysis using a number of systems. It is not our 
intent o review this work here, but only to indicate how our 
particular project - -  COMLEX Syntax - -  got started. 
The initial impetus was provided by Charles Wayne, the 
DARPA/SISTO program manager, in discussions at a meet- 
ing held at New Mexico State University in January 1992 to 
inaugurate he Consortium for Lexical Research. These dis- 
cussions were further developed at a session at the February, 
1992 DARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshop at Ar- 
den House; a number of proposals were offered there for both 
interchange standards and shareable dictionaries and gram- 
mars. At a subsequent DARPA meeting in July 1992 these 
ideas crystallized into a proposal by James Pustejovsky and 
Ralph Gnshman to the Linguistic Data Consortium to fund a 
COMLEX effort. 
Starting from this general proposal, a detailed and formal 
specification of the syntactic features to be encoded in the 
lexicon was developed at New York University in the fall of 
1992. These specifications were presented at several meet- 
ings, at NYU, at the Univ. of Pennsylvania, nd at New 
Mexico State University, and form the basis for the project 
described here. 
2. Structure of the Entries 
Each entry is organized as a nested set of feature-value lists, 
using a Lisp-style notation. Each list consists of a type symbol 
followed by zero or more keyword-value pairs. Each value 
may in turn be an atom, a string, a list of strings, feature- 
value list, or a list of feature-value lists. This is similar in 
appearance to the typed feature structures which have been 
used in some other computer lexicons, although we have not 
yet made any significant use of the inheritance potential of 
these structures. 
Sample dictionary entries are shown in Figure 1. The first 
symbol gives the part of speech; a word with several parts of 
speech will have several dictionary entries, one for each part 
of speech. Each entry has an :orth feature, giving the base 
form of the word. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives with irregular 
morphology will have features for the irregular forms :plu- 
ral, :past, :pastoart, etc. Words which take complements 
will have a subcategorization (:subc) feature. For example, 
the verb "abandon" can occur with a noun phrase followed 
by a prepositional phrase with the preposition "to" (e.g., "I 
abandoned him to the linguists.") or with just a noun phrase 
complement ("I abandoned the ship."). Other syntactic fea- 
tures are recorded under :features. For example, the noun 
"abandon" is marked as (countable :pval ("with")), indicat- 
ing that it must appear in the singular with a determiner unless

it is preceded by the preposition "with". 
Other formats have been suggested for dictionary sharing, 
notably those developed under the Text Encoding Initiative 
using SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). We 
do not expect hat it would be difficult to map the completed 
lexicon into one of these formats if desired. In addition, 
some dictionary standards require an entry for each inflected 
form, whereas COMLEX will have an entry for each base 
form (lemma). COMLEX has taken this approach in order to 
avoid having duplicate and possibly inconsistent information 
for different inflected forms (e.g., for subcategorization). It is 
straightforward, however, to "expand" the dictionary to have 
one entry for each inflected form. 
In addition to the information shown, each entry will have 
revision control information: information on by whom and 
when it was created, and by whom and when it was revised. 
We are also intending to include frequency information, ini- 
tially just at the part-of-speech level, but eventually at the 
subcategorization frame level as well. 
3. Subcategorization 
We have paid particular attention to providing detailed sub- 
categorization i formation (information about complement 
structure), both for verbs and for those nouns and adjectives 
which do take complements. The names for the different 
complement types are based on the conventions used in the 
Brandeis verb lexicon, where each complement is designated 
by the names of its constituents, together with a few tags to 
indicate things such as control phenomena. Each comple- 
ment ype is formally defined by a frame (see Figure 2). The 
frame includes the constituent s ructure, :cs, the grammatical 
structure, :9 s, one or more :features, and one or more ex- 
amples, :ex. ~ The constituent s ructure lists the constituents

Ingria for the DARPA Common Lexicon. 
in sequence; the grammatical structure indicates the func- 
tional role played by each constituent. The elements of the 
constituent s ructure are indexed, and these indices are ref- 
erenced in the grammatical structure field (in vp-frames, the 
index "1" in the grammatical structures refers to the subject 
of the verb). 
Three verb frames are shown in Figure 2. The first, S, is for full 
sentential complements with an optional "that" complemen- 
tizer. The second and third frames both represent infinitival 
complements, and differ only in their functional structure. 
The to-inf-sc frame is for subject-control verbs - -  verbs for 
which the surface subject is the functional subject of both the 
matrix and embedded clauses. The notation :subject 1 in 
the :cs field indicates that surface subject is the subject of 
the embedded clause, while the :subject 1 in the :OS field 
indicates that it is the subject of the matrix clause. The indi- 
cation :features (:control subject) provides this information 
redundantly; we include both indications in case one is more 
convenient for particular dictionary users. Theto-inf-rs frame 
is for raising-to-subject verbs - -  verbs for which the surface 
subject is the functional subject only of the embedded clause. 
The functional subject position in the matrix clause is unfilled, 
as indicated by the notation :gs (:subject 0 :comp 2). 
We have compared our subcategofization codes to those used 
by a number of other major lexicon projects in order to insure 
that our codes are reasonably complete and that it would not 
be too difficult to map our codes into those of other systems. 
Among the projects we have studied are the Brandeis Verb 
Lexicon 2, the ACQUILEX Project \[3\], the NYU Linguistic 
String Project \[2\], and the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dic- 
tionary \[1\].

4. Creation and Verification 
We are deriving the word and part-of-speech lists for COM- 
LEX from two sources: (1) the dictionary file prepared by 
Prof. Roger Mitton, which was derived from the Oxford Ad- 
vanced Learner's Dictionary; (2) word lists (with frequency 
information) obtained from corpora nd tagged corpora. We 
are already using the "joint ventures" corpus prepared for 
the Tipster information extraction task (and for MUC-5); we 
expect to employ other and larger corpora in the future. 
Using these word lists, a number of part-time staff members 
will manually assign syntactic features to each word. These 
staff members will have access to several conventional dic- 
tionaries as well as a large on-line text concordance. 
We intend to use a variety of techniques toverify the dictionary 
information. A portion of the dictionary will be coded twice; a 
comparison of the resulting entries will give us some estimate 
of the error rate. We will compare the subcategofization 
information produced by our codes with the codes derived 
from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, and review 
discrepancies) For the less frequent features, we will list all 
the words assigned a particular feature; this often will point 
up inconsistencies in coders' judgements. Finally, we hope in 
the near future to couple the assignment of subcategorization 
features with the tagging of a corpus. 
5. Status 
As of April 1993, 
? the formal specifications have been further evised and 
are now largely complete 
3We would hope to obtain permission to compare our dictionary with 
other broad-coverage dictionaries, and use the result o further improve our 
dictionary. 
a manual has been prepared with more extensive narra- 
tive descriptions of the classes to assist coders in prepar- 
ing dictionary entries 
a menu-based program has been developed for rapid 
preparation of dictionary entries; this program is coded 
in Lisp using the Garnet graphical user interface package 
an initial dictionary of all closed-class words (those with 
parts of speech other than noun, verb, adjective, and 
adverb) has been prepared 
Creation of dictionary entries for the open-class words is just 
beginning. We hope that corpus tagging of word instances 
with respect o their subcategorization pattern can begin in 
the summer and proceed in parallel with the dictionary prepa- 
ration effort.
