1. THE ENGLISH TEST COLLECTION 
1.1 Introduction 
Critical to the success of TIPSTER was the creation of the 
test collection. Like most traditional retrieval collections, 
there are three distinct parts to this collection--the docu- 
ments, the queries or topics, and the relevance judgments 
or "right answers". It was important to match all three 
parts of the collection to the TIPSTER application. 
The document collection needed to reflect the corpus 
imagined to be seen by analysts. This meant hat a very 
large collection was needed to test the scaling of the algo- 
rithms, including documents from many different domains 
to test the domain independence of the algorithms. Addi- 
tionally the documents selected needed to mirror the dif- 
ferent ypes of documents used in the TIPSTER applica- 
tion. Specifically they had to have a varied length, a var- 
ied writing style, a varied level of editing and a varied vo- 
cabulary. As a final requirement, the documents had to 
cover different fimeframes to show the effects of docu- 
ment date on the routing task. 
The topics for the TIPSTER collection were also designed 
to model some of the needs of analysts. It was assumed 
that the typical user of these retrieval systems was a dedi- 
cated searcher, not a novice searcher, and that the model 
for the application was one needing both the monitoring 
of data streams for information on specific topics (rout- 
ing), and the ability to do adhoc searches on archived ata 
for new topics. It was also assumed that the users need 
the ability to do both high precision and high recall 
searches, and are willing to look at many documents and 
repeatedly modify queries in order to get high recall. The 
topics therefore were created to be very specific, but in- 
cluded both broad and narrow searching needs. Many of 
the topics were created to test performance on specific 
types of searches. 
The relevance assessments were made by retired analysts 
who were asked to view the task as if they were address- 
ing a real information eed. The narrative section of the 
topic (described in more detail later) contained a clear 
definition of what made a document relevant, and the as- 
sessors used this section as the definition of the informa- 
tion need. Each topic was judged by a single assessor so 
that all documents screened would reflect he same user's 
interpretation f topic. 
1.2 The Documents 
The documents came from many different sources. These 
sources were selected not only because of their suitability 
to the TIPSTER task, but also because of their availability. 
The data was provided by the University of Pennsylvania, 
initially as part of the ACL/DCI text initiative, but later as 
part of the Linguistic Data Consortium effort. A success- 
ful pattern for data source selection was established for 
the first disk and was followed for disks 2 and 3. First, 
two sets of documents were obtained that contained arti- 
cles from all domains. The first set of articles was from a 
newspaper (the Wall Street Journal in disks 1 and 2, the 
San Jose Mercury News in disk 3), and the second set of 
articles was from a newswire (AP in all three disks). In 
addition to covering all domains, these two sets provide a 
strong contrast in their format, style, and accuracy of edit- 
ing, and were both readily available. The third set of doc- 
uments was selected to cover more deeply a particular do- 
main. Partially because of availability, the particular set 
used was a subset of the Computer Select disks, from 
Ziff-Davis publishing. These documents cover the wide 
domain of computers and computer technology, but in- 
clude many different sources of actual documents. This 
creates a set of documents in a single (broad) domain, but 
having a range of formatting and writing styles. The final 
set of documents (or final two sets in the first disk) were 
selected less for content han for length of articles. Since 
the documents in the first three sets were of medium 
length, and of fairly uniform length, the final set of docu- 
ments was picked to be especially long, and of non- 
uniform length. Documents from the Federal Register 
were used for the first two disks, and some U.S. Patents 
were used on disk 3. Additionally the first disk contained 
some very short abstracts from the Department of Energy.

All documents were originally received at the University 
of Pennsylvania in various pnnt-tape formats. These for- 
mats were converted to an SGML-Iike structure and sent 
to NIST. At NIST the documents were assigned unique 
document identifiers and the formats were more standard- 
ized. The following example shows an abbreviated ver- 
sion of a typical document.

Al l  documents  have beginning and end markers, and a 
unique DOCNO id field. Additionally other fields taken 
from the initial data appear, but these vary widely across 
the different sources. The documents have differing 
amounts of errors, which were not checked or corrected. 
Not only would this have been an impossible task, but the 
errors in the data provide a better simulation of the TIP- 
STER task. Errors in missing document separators or bad 
document numbers were screened out, although a few 
were missed and later reported as errors. 
Table 1 shows some basic document collection statistics. 
Note that although the collection sizes are roughly equiv- 
alent in megabytes, there is a range of document lengths 
from very short documents (DOE) to very long (FR). Al- 
so the range of document lengths within a collection 
varies. For example, the documents from AP are similar 
in length (the median and the average length are very 
close), but the WSJ and ZIFF documents have a wider 
range of lengths. The documents from the Federal Regis- 
ter (FR) have a very wide range of lengths. 
The distribution of terms in these subsets how interesting 
variations. Table 2 shows some term distribution statistics 
found using a small stopword list of 25 terms and no 
stemming. For example the AP has more unique terms 
than the others, probably reflecting both more proper 
names and more spelling errors. The DOE collection, 
while very small, is highly technical and covers many do- 
mains, resulting in many specific technical terms. The 
typical distribution of terms in the collections in general 
corresponds to Zipf's law \[1\] in that about half the total 
number of unique terms only appear once. This is least 
applicable to the newspaper data, possibly because the vo- 
cabulary used is more controlled than in the other collec- 
tions. The newspaper data also has the highest number of 
occurrences of terms for those terms appearing more than 
once.

1.3 The  Topics 
Traditional information retrieval test collections have typi- 
cally included sentence-length queries. These queries are 
usually automatically transformed into a machine version 
for searching, with minimal changes. In designing the 
TIPSTER task, there was a conscious decision made to 
provide "user need" statements rather than the more tradi- 
tional queries. Two major issues were involved in this de- 
cision. First there was a desire to allow a wide range of 
query construction methods by keeping the topic (the 
need statement) distinct from the query (the actual text 
submitted to the system). The second issue was the abili- 
ty to increase the amount of information available about 
each topic, in particular to include with each topic a clear 
statement of what criteria make a document relevant. 
The topics were designed to mimic a real user's need, and 
were written by people who are actual users of a retrieval 
system. Topics 1-25 and 51-80 were written by a group 
of different users. Topics 26-50 were mostly written by a 
single user and cover the general domain of computers. 
Topics 81-150 were also written by a single user, but 
cover many domains. 
Although the subject domain of the topics was diverse, 
some consideration was given to the documents to be 
searched. The initial ideas for topics were either generat- 
ed spontaneously, or by seeing interesting topic areas 
while doing other searches. These initial ideas were then 
used in trial searches against a sample of the document 
set, and those topics that had roughly 25 to 100 hits in that 
sample were used as a final topic. This created a range of 
broader and narrower topics. After a topic idea was final- 
ized, each topic was developed into a standardized format. 
The following is one of the topics used in TIPSTER and 
shows the formatting. 
<top> 
<head> Tipster Topic Description 
<hUm> Number: 066 
<dora> Domain: Science and Technology 
<title> Topic: Natural Language Processing 
<con> Concept(s): 
1. natural anguage processing 
2. translation, language, dictionary, font 
3. software applications 
<fac> Factor(s):

</fac> 
<def> Definition(s): 
</top> 
Each topic is formatted in the same standard manner to al- 
low easier automatic onstruction of queries. Besides a 
beginning and an end marker, each topic has a number, a
short rifle, and a one-sentence d scription. Then there are 
three major types of sections. 
The first type of section is the narrative section. This sec- 
tion is meant o be a full description of the information 
need, in terms of what separates a relevant document from 
a non-relevant document. The narrative sections were 
constructed by looking at relevant documents in the trial 
sample arid determining what kinds of information were 
needed to provide focus for the topic. These sections are 
primarily meant as instructions to the assessors, but could 
be used in building the queries either manually or auto- 
matically. The narratives often contain augmentations of 
the description, such as examples, or resU'ictions to focus 
the topic. The following three narratives illustrate these. 
Example of augmentation 
<num> Number: 082 
A relevant document will discuss a product, e.g., drug, 
microorganism, vaccine, animal, plant, agricultural 
product, developed by genetic engineering techniques; 
identify an application, such as to clean up the environ- 
ment or human gene therapy for a specific problem; or, 
present human attitudes toward genetic engineering. 
Example of positive restrictions 
<desc> Description: 
Document will identify a type of natural anguage pro- 
cessing technology which is being developed or market- 
ed in the U.S. 
<narr> Narrative: A relevant document will identify a 
company or institution developing or marketing a natu- 
ral language processing technology, identify the tech- 
nology, and identify one or more features of the compa- 
ny's product. 
<num> Number: 121 
A relevant document will provide obituary information 
on a prominent U.S. person who died of an identified 
type of cancer. In addition to the individual's name and 
cancer, the report must provide sufficient biographical 
information for a determination of why the life and 
contributions of the individual were worthy of some 
comment upon death. In other words, a one or two line 
obituary is NOT sufficient. 
20 
Example of negative restrictions 
<num> Number: 067 
A relevant document will report he location of the dis- 
turbance, the identity of the group causing the distur- 
bance, the nature of the disturbance, the identity of the 
group suppressing the disturbance and the political 
goals of the protesters. It should NOT be about eco- 
nomically-motivated civil disturbances and NOT be 
about a civil disturbance directed against a second 
country. 
Many narratives are a mix of augmentation and restric- 
tion. Whereas the narratives did provide the type of clear 
direction needed by the human assessors, they also pro- 
vide a challenge for query consu'uction by machines. 
The second type of section is the concepts ection. This 
section is meant o reflect he "world-knowledge" brought 
to the task by the users, and is the type of information that 
could be elicited by prompts from a good interface. The 
concepts ections were constructed by locating "useful" 
information in some of the relevant documents in the trial 
sample. This information was then grouped into concep- 
tually related ideas, although these relationships vary 
widely across topics. To show some examples of con- 
cepts, the concept lists for the three narratives previously 
shown are given. 
<num> Number: 067 
<con> Concept(s): 
1. protest, unrest, demonstration, march, riot, 
clash, uprising, rally, boycott, sit-in 
2. students, agitators, dissidents 
3. police, riot police, troops, army, National 
Guard, government forces 
4. NOT economically-motivated 
<num> Number: 082 
<con> Concept(s): 
1. genetic engineering, molecular manipulation 
2. biotechnology 
3. genetically engineered product: plant, animal, 
drug, microorganism, vaccine, agricultural 
product 
4. cure a disease, clean up the environment, in- 
crease agricultural productivity 
<num> Number: 121 
<con> Concept(s): 
21 
1. cancer 
2. death, obituary 
It should be noted that the number of concepts given, the 
organization of the concepts, and the "usefulness" of the 
concepts vary widely across the topics. The concepts in 
general provide excellent keywords for retrieval systems, 
although this also varies widely across the topics. 
The third type of section is the optional factors section 
and optional definition section. These sections only ap- 
pear when necessary; the factors ection is an attempt to 
codify some of the text in the narrative for easier use by 
automatic query construction algorithms, and the defini- 
tion section has one or two of the definitions critical to a 
human understanding of the topic. Two particular factors 
were used in the TIPSTER topics: a time factor (current, 
before a given date, etc.) and a geographic factor (either 
involving only certain countries or excluding certain 
countries). The definitions ection was minimally used in 
the TIPSTER topics, but did provide some critical defini- 
tions for some of the more unusual terminology. 
1.4 The Relevance Judgments  
The relevance judgments are of critical importance to a 
test collection. For each topic it is necessary to compile a 
list of relevant documents; hopefully as comprehensive a 
list as possible. For the TIPSTER task, three possible 
methods for finding the relevant documents could have 
been used. In the first method, full relevance judgments 
could have been made on over a million documents for 
each topic, resulting in over 100 million judgments. This 
was clearly impossible. As a second approach, a random 
sample of the documents could have been taken, with rel- 
evance judgments done on that sample only. The problem 
with this approach is that a random sample that is large 
enough to find on the order of 200 relevant documents per 
topic is a very large random sample, and is likely to result 
in insufficient relevance judgments. The third method, the 
one used in building the TIPSTER collection, was to 
make relevance judgments on the sample of documents 
selected by the various participating systems (including 
the systems in TREC). This method is known as the pool- 
ing method, and has been used successfully in creating 
other collections. It was the recommended method in 
1975 proposal to the British Library to build a very large 
test collection \[2\]. 
To consU'uct the pool, the following was done. 
1. Divide each set of results into results for a given 
topic 
2. For each topic within a set of results, select he 
top X ranked ocuments for input to the pool 
3. For each topic, merge results from all systems 
4. For each topic, sort results based on document 
numbers 
5. For each topic, remove duplicate documents 
The aim in a pooling method is to have a broad enough 
sample of search systems so that most relevant documents 
for a given topic are found. Since it is well known that 
different systems retrieve different sets of relevant docu- 
ments \[3\], it is critical to have as many systems as possi- 
ble contributing to this pool. For that reason, the TIP- 
STER systems were judged against he pool of relevant 
documents constructed from both the TREC and TIP- 
STER evaluations. For the 12-month evaluation, no 
TREC results were available and therefore only a partial 
TIPSTER evaluation was possible. However the relevant 
documents found at the 12-month evaluation were pooled 
with the TREC-1 results at the first TREC conference. 
At each evaluation period, the merged list of results was 
then shown to the human assessors. For the TIPSTER 
12-month evaluation, the top 200 documents for each run 
were judged, but the overwhelming number of unique 
documents for TREC-1 meant that only the top 100 docu- 
ments for each run were judged. This still resulted in an 
average of 1462.24 documents judged for each topic, 
ranging from a high of 2893 for topic 74 to a low of 611 
for topic 46. Each topic was judged by a single assessor 
to insure the best consistency of judgment and varying 
numbers of documents were judged relevant to the topics. 
The two histograms on the next page show the number of 
documents judged relevant for each of the topics. The 
topics are sorted by the number of relevant documents o
better show their range and median. The first histogram 
shows the number of relevant documents for topics 
51-100, first used as adhoc topics against disks 1 and 2, 
and then used as routing topics against disk 3. The sec- 
ond histogram shows the number of relevant documents 
for topics 101-150 used as adhoc topics against disks 1 
and 2. 
Several interesting facts can be seen by looking at the first 
histogram. The median number of relevant documents 
per topic for disks I and 2 is 277, with 22 topics having 
300 or more relevant documents, and 11 topics having 
more than 500 relevant documents. When these same top- 
ics were used as routing topics against different data (disk 
3), only about half the number of relevant documents 
were found. This is reasonable given that there is only 
about half the amount of data. Some topics have far fewer 
than half the number of relevant documents; in general 
these are the topics that are particularly time dependent. 
The second histogram shows the number of relevant docu- 
ments for topics 101-150 against disks 1 and 2. The top- 
ics are narrower than topics 51-100 as the result of an ef- 
fort to create fewer topics with more than 300 relevant 
documents. This effort was triggered by the concern that 
topics with more than 300 relevant documents are likely 
to have incomplete relevance assessments. Only 11 topics 
have more than 300 relevant documents, with only 2 top- 
ics having more than 500 relevant documents. The medi- 
an number of relevant documents i 201 for this set of 
topics, down from 277 for topics 51-100. 
1.5 Some Preliminary Analysis 
Much analysis needs to be done on this test collection. 
Questions about he effec/.s of the long and varied docu- 
ments, the complex topics, the pooling of system results, 
and the relevance judgments will be asked (and answered) 
as the test collection is further used and investigated. The 
following section discusses ome preliminary answers to 
these questions, particularly questions relating to how 
well the collection has served the TIPSTER evaluation 
task. 
The documents 
The first question involves the effect of the various 
sources and lengths of the documents. Table 3 shows the 
distribution of retrieved, judged, and relevant documents 
across the collections. The first 5 rows show the docu- 
ments from disks 1 and 2 using topics 101-150. The last 
4 rows show the documents from disk 3 using topics 
51-100. The second column shows the total number of 
documents from each document source that was retrieved 
by rank 100 by any of the systems in TIPSTER and 
TREC-2. The third column shows how many of these 
documents were unique and therefore were judged. The 
final column shows how many of these documents were 
actually relevant.

The analysis of the adhoc topics 101-150 (first 5 rows) 
shows that by far the largest number of relevant docu- 
menU; come from the document sources covering all do- 
mains (AP -- 4823; WSJ -- 4556). Of the five document 
sources on disks 1 and 2, these two had the overwhelm- 
ingly highest number of relevant documents, the lowest 
percentage of unique documents, and the highest percent- 
age of relevant documents found in the judged set. The 
very long FR documents had few relevant documents, but 
a high number of retrieved ocuments and a high percent- 
age of unique documents. This demonstrates the difficul- 
ty most retrieval systems had in screening out long docu- 
ments and shows the almost random nature of retrieval 
from this set of "noise" documents. The much shorter 
DOE documents caused no such problems, with a larger 
number of relevant documents being found, but with a far 
fewer number of documents being retrieved. The lower 
percentage of unique documents for the DOE documents 
as opposed to the FR documents indicates that hese short 
documents are being effectively handled by the systems. 
The single-domain ZIFF document source also appears to 
be as effectively retrieved as the all-domain sources. 
The analysis of the routing topics 51-100 (last 4 rows) 
shows much the same pattern. The long PAT documents 
cause the same high retrieval and low accuracy as the FR 
documents did for the adhoc. Additionally, the number of 
unique documents is a higher percentage for all data 
sources in the routing task, This is due to the broad range 
of query terms used in routing, where the query terms are 
usually taken from both the topic and the training docu- 
ments. The broad range of terms Used across the systems 
caused more unique documents obe retrieved. However, 
a smaller percentage of these documents are relevant, 
likely because of time differences in the test data. 
Many of the same trends can be seen if this distribution is
broken down by topics. Tables 4 and 5 show the distribu- 
tion of the relevant documents across databases on a per 
topic basis. Table 4 shows the first set of topics, used for 
routing in TREC-1. The first 25 topics are mostly based 
on information i  the Wall Street Journal, with many in 
the financial domain. Almost all of the second 25 topics 
(26-50) are in the single domain of computers. As would 
be expected, the first 25 topics have mostly WSJ docu- 
ments as relevant, whereas the second 25 topics have 
mostly ZIFF documents as relevant. Very few of these 
topics had any DOE or FR relevant documents. Ad- 
dit;ionally the first 25 topics have many AP documents as 
relevant, as many of the financial topics are discussed in 
the newswire. The second 25 topics have few AP relevant 
documents in general, but a reasonably large number of 
WSJ documents ince computers are often discussed in 
the Wall Street Journal.

Table 4: Number of relevant documents by database 
Topics 51-100 shown in table 5 were used as adhoc topics 
in TREC-1 and TIPSTER-12 month, and as routing topics 
in the later evaluations. Topics 101-150 were only used as 
adhoc topics. Both these sets of  topics cover many do- 
mains, and have equally large numbers of relevant docu- 
ments from both the AP newswke and the Wall Street 
Journal. They have few relevant from either DOE or FR, 
and those relevant are concentrated in about 11 topics out 
of the 100. The relevant documents from ZIFF are also 
concentrated in general, with slightly more topics having 
relevant ZIFF documents than FR or DOE documents. 
Note that the count of the relevant AP and ZIFF docu- 
ments shown for topics 51-100 include documents from 
all three disks. However the WSJ documents from disks 1 
and 2 reflect the use of the topics for the adhoc runs, 
whereas the SJIVlN documents are used only for routing. 
This may explain why many of the topics have high num- 
bers of relevant documents from the WSJ set, with few 
from the SJMN set. The time difference of these sets 
could affect some topics, or this difference could be 
caused by a slight difference in the domains covered by 
these newspapers. 
The topics 
The topics are both very long and very complex, and have 
many more relevant documents han other test collections. 
A major question therefore ishow these characteristics af-
fect retrieval performance. Table 6 shows a preliminary 
analysis of system performance with respect to topic 
broadness and the level of restrictions and the use of fac- 
tors in the topics. The difficulty or "hardness" measure 
shown in column two is the average relative recall for that 
topic across all systems in TREC and TIPSTER that used 
the full document collections. The relative recall is de- 
fined as the recall at R relevant documents (where R is the 
total number of relevant documents for a topic) if R is less 
than some threshold (100 in this case), OR the precision 
at that threshold if R is greater than the threshold. This 
measure shows how effectively a system is performing at 
the early stage of retrieval, and is to a large extent inde- 
pendent of the total number of relevant documents found 
for a topic. The average of this measure over many sys- 
tems is a good indication of the difficulty of a given topic. 
Column 3 of table 6 shows the total number of relevant 
documents for a given topic. A strong relationship can be 
seen between the difficulty of a topic and the number of 
relevant documents found for topics 101-150 in that the 
narrower topics are also the harder topics. Column 4 
shows the type of restrictions used in the narrative section 
of a topic. The "R" stands for some type of resuiction 
whereas the "N" means that a "NOT" was explicitly used 
in the topic narrative (e.g." A document isNOT relevant if
it merely mentions the illegal spread of a computer virus 
..."). There is a possible weak relation between the re- 
strictions and the performance, but this trend seems to be 
more related to the broadness of a topic, i.e. narrow top- 
iscs are more likely to have restrictions in the narrative. 
The final column contains a code for any factors used in 
the factors ection of the topic--"G" stands for geographic 
factors and "T" stands for time factors. There is no clear 
relationship between the use of factors and the difficulty 
of a topic. 
Table 7 shows the same statistics but for topics 51-100 as 
used in TREC-1 and the earlier TIPSTER evaluations as 
adhoc topics. Again there is no relationship between the 
use of factors and topic difficulty. The relationship be- 
tween the use of restrictions and topic difficulty is not ob- 
vious for this set of topics, and the relationship between 
restrictions and topic broadness has also disappeared. Fi- 
nally the relationship between topic broadness and topic 
difficulty that is clearly seen for topics 101-150 is very 
weak for topics 51-100. 
What is the explanation for these observations? First, the 
lack of correlation between the use of factors and retrieval 
performance, and the weak correlation between the use of 
restrictions and retrieval performance r flects the idiosyn- 
cratic use of language. The performance of retrieval sys- 
tems on a given topic depends on the ease with which a 
topic maps to the document set. If a topic contains much 
the same terms as do its relevant documents, then the 
match is easier than for a topic which has more general 
terminology or one that requires inferences to make the 
map to many of the relevant documents. For example, the 
description for topic 74 reads "Document will cite an in- 
stance in which the U.S. government propounds two con- 
flicting or opposing policies". Clearly this topic will be 
difficult, regardless of the presence of any type of restric- 
tions or factors. In contrast, he topic description for topic 
87 is "Document will report on current criminal actions 
against officers of a failed U.S. financial institution". This 
topic not only has more specific terminology, but more 
readily lends itself to term expansion techniques. 
The relationship of topic difficulty and topic broadness i
more tentative. Whereas there is a strong relationship for 
topics 101-150, the relationship is weak to non-existent 
for topics 51-100. Three different explanations eed fur- 
ther exploration. First, there may be an overall difference 
between the topic sets that remains to be characterized. 
Second, there may be a relationship between the maturity 
of retrieval systems and the correlation of topic hardness 
and broadness. The overall performance l vel used to 
measure topic hardness for topics 101-150 was much im- 
proved from that used for topics 51-100. And third, it

Table 7: Characterization f topics by hardness, broadness, and levels of restrictions, both as adhoc topics 
and as rouiing topics 
28 
may be that the hard topics have less complete relevance 
judgments than the easy ones (however this does not ex- 
plain the difference between the topic sets). All three of 
these hypotheses are currently under investigation. 
The last section of table 7 shows the performance of top- 
ics 51-100 as routing topics. Column 6 shows the relative 
recall for each topic for routing against new data (disk 3). 
There is a weak correlation between topic difficulty as an 
adhoc topic, and its difficulty as a routing topic. In partic- 
ular, topics that are easy as adhoc topics are still generally 
easy as routing topics. However some topics that were 
hard adhoc topics became asy routing topics, usually be- 
cause of the term expansion available using the training 
documents (the relevant documents from the adhoc task). 
Some hard topics remained hard, and some topics became 
more difficult because of time differentials between the 
training data and the test data. There is a minimal correla- 
tion between the number of relevant documents as adhoc 
topics (i.e. the number of documents available for train- 
ing) and the performance of the topic as a routing topic. 
The TIPSTER topics are not only broad and complex, but 
also very long. Other test collections have much shorter 
topics of one or two sentences in length, whereas the TIP- 
STER topics are generally about a page in length. Longer 
topics provide more information, but also a large number 
of non-discriminating terms. One section of the TIP- 
STER topics, the description section, could be viewed as a 
one-sentence summary of the topics, and table 8 shows 
the difference in performance for one of the TIPSTER 
systems using just the description section vs. the "full" 
topic (results from the TIPSTER 24-month INQUERY 
system, INQ009 using the title, description and concepts 
and INQ013 using the description only). Use of the de- 
scription only cuts retrieval effectiveness by about one 
half, both on average across the entire recall range and at 
the high performance end (precision at 100). The recall 
performance is particular affected, as would be expected. 
This drop in performance is due to fewer topic terms be- 
ing available for matching. Interestingly, however, the 
shorter topics do retrieve some relevant documents not re- 
trieved by the longer ones, although this is clearly a rank- 
ing effect since the terms from the description are a subset 
of the full topic terms. 
It should be noted, however, that this performance differ- 
ence is not due solely to topic length. The concepts ec- 
tion of the topic consistently provides very valuable terms 
for retrieval, and minimal additional improvement comes 
from adding the longer narrative section. This may be 
caused by a temporary lag in research in how to properly 
handle this narrative section.

The relevance judgments 
Two particular issues are being investigated with respect 
to the relevance judgments. The first is the effectiveness 
of the merging of results across the TIPSTER and TREC 
systems to form the pool of documents sent to the rele- 
vance assessors. One of the measures of this effectiveness 
is the overlap of retrieved ocuments. If there is a heavy 
overlap in that all systems retrieve the same documents 
for a given topic, then it is likely that relevant documents 
will be missed. 
Table 9 shows the overlap statistics for TREC-1, with a 
total of 28 systems including the TIPSTER systems.

Table 9: Overlap of submitted results (TIPSTER 
12-month +TREC-1) 
The first overlap statistics are for the adhoc topics and the 
second statistics are for the routing topics. For example, 
out of a maximum possible 9000 unique documents (45 
runs times 200 documents), about 27% of the documents 
were actually unique for the adhoc topics. There are sig- 
nificantly more unique documents for routing. The over- 
lap is much less than was expected, which means that the 
systems were finding different documents as likely rele- 
vant documents for a topic. Whereas this might be ex- 
29 
pected from widely differing systems, these overlaps were 
often between two runs for a given system, or between 
two systems run on the same basic retrieval engine. One 
reason for the lack of overlap is the very large number of 
documents hat contain many of the same keywords as the 
relevant documents. More importantly, however, many 
systems used different sets of keywords in the constructed 
queries, resulting in the often unique sets of retrieved oc- 
uments. This is particularly true for the muting topics, 
where often unique terms were added ffrom the training 
documents. The fact that the muting topics are run 
against only half the number of documents as the adhoc 
topics, but still have many more unique retrieved ocu- 
ments per topic suggests trongly that the wide variation 
in query terms is the cause of the small overlap. The 
same lack of overlap still holds at the 100 document mark, 
indicating that the systems retrieve different documents 
even at the beginning of the ranked lists. 
This lack of overlap improves the coverage of the relevant 
set, and verifies the use of the pooling methodology to 
produce the sample. It should be noted, however, that be- 
cause complete judgments were not made, the recall mea- 
sures must be considered to be relative rather than abso- 
lute. Whereas each system is fairly evaluated against his 
pool, future systems (with widely differing methods) 
might find additional relevant documents that would be 
considered non-relevant by default.

Table 10: Overlap of submitted results (TIPSTER 
18-month + TREC-2) plus TIPSTER 24-month 
Table 10 shows the overlap of the submitted results from 
the later TIPSTER evaluations and the TREC-2 evalua- 
tion. In this case only the top I00 documents are shown 
as these were the only ones judged due to limited time. 
Note that there is a significantly higher overlap in the 
TREC-2 results (including the TIPSTER 18-month runs). 
Only about 21% of the retrieved ocuments for the adhc~c 
topics were actually unique, with slightly more unique 
documents for the routing topics. This is likely due to 
better performance atthis later date (fewer errors with Icss 
spread of retrieved ocuments). In particular, the fewer 
unique documents for the routing topics is probably due 
to the better training data in addition to better systems. 
The many additional runs made for the TIPSTER 
24-month evaluation on the same data as for TREC-2 re- 
sulted in few new documents. For example, out of a pos- 
sible 3600 unique documents retrieved for routing (per 
topic), only about 8% had not already been seen in 
TREC-2. This implies that, at least for the current sys- 
tems in TIPSTER and TREC, some asymptote is being 
reached for finding new documents. 
This hypothesis will be investigated in the coming 
months. A series of experiments i  being planned to in- 
vestigate the coverage of the relevant documents, i.e. how 
many relevant documents have been missed because they 
did not appear in the pool for judgment. Two types of ex- 
periments are planned involving additional relevance 
judgments to be made for some topics. The topics will be 
selected to cover a range of narrow and broad topics, with 
an emphasis on the mid-range topics which constitute the 
majority of the TIPSTER topics (mid-range being around 
200 relevant documents). First, systems that seem likely 
to retrieve unique relevant documents beyond the current 
100 mark will be selected and a new pool of possible rele- 
vant documents will be created for the subset of topics be- 
ing investigated. This new pool will be submitted for as- 
sessment to the same assessor used for the earlier judg- 
ments. Additionally topics will be submitted to haman in- 
termediaries to conduct extensive searches. The results 
from these searches will also be assessed by the official 
relevance assessors. These two sets of experiments will 
provide some indication of the completeness of the pool. 
An issue related to the completeness problem is the issue 
of relevance bias. Whereas it can be assumed that the 
judgments are not absolutely complete, it is hoped that the 
judgments are not biased toward one type of system as 
opposed to another, e.g. a system using a particular type 
of weighting scheme. This is a possibility given that the 
TIPSTER contractors contributed many more documents 
for assessment than the TREC participants (and therefore 
the assessments may be more biased toward the TIPSTER 
systems), or alternatively many of the TREC systems 
were based on a single weighting scheme, and this could 
cause a bias. The existence of this bias will also be inves- 
tigated. 
In addition to the completeness or bias of the pooling 
method, it is necessary to investigate he quality of the rel- 
evance assessments themselves. Two different consisten- 
cy issues must be addressed-- the consistency of a single 
judge and the consistency between judges on a single top- 
ic. The first issue will be addressed by submitting random

1.6 Comparison to Other Collections 
The TIPSTER collection is many magnitudes of scale 
larger than existing collections in several ways. First 
there are many more documents. Table 11 shows a com- 
parison of the documents on disk 1 of the TIPSTER col- 
lection (about one-third of the full collection) to the Cran- 
field collection, ne of the oldest collections. Even the 
largest publically-available collection, the NPL collection, 
only has 11,429 documents. Second, the documents are 
longer, with most documents being full text as opposed to 
the abstracts found in other collections. 
The topics are also longer and more complex. This issue 
was discussed earlier in the analysis ection, and therefore 
will not be repeated here. However the long and complex 
topics are the main research challenge of the TIPSTER 
collection; the difference in document collection size and 
document length generally present system engineering 
challenges and cause less difficulty after the initial system 
scaling-up. 
There are also many more relevant documents per topic. 
Older collections tend to have an average of ten or fewer 
relevant documents per topic, whereas the average num- 
ber of relevant documents per topic for the TIPSTER col- 
lection is over 200. 
ject. Topic development was also delayed ue to difficul- 
ty in discovering methods of constructing topics. Seven 
topics were delivered in time for the 24-month evaluation, 
and results from the two TIPSTER contractors working in 
Japanese were assessed for relevance. The development 
of a full collection in Japanese is a continuing effort.

2. THE JAPANESE TEST  COLLECT ION 
The design of the Japanese test collection was similar to 
that of the English collection, with similar formats used in 
both the documents and topics. However because of the 
difficulty in obtaining large amounts of Japanese data, the 
Japanese part of the project was slower to start. The doc- 
uments, 206 megabytes (151,650 records), of the Nikkei 
newspaper were distributed in the second year of the pro-
