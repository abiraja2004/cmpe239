Abstract
In this paper, we report a Japanese language re-
source for answering how-type questions. It
was developed it by using mails posted to a
mailing list. We show a QA system based on
this language resource.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we report a Japanese language resource
for answering how type questions. It was developed by
using mails posted to a mailing list and it was given
the four types of descriptions: (1) mail type, (2) key
sentence, (3) semantic label, and (4) credibility label.
Credibility is a center problem of knowledge acquiti-
sion from natural language documents because the doc-
uments, including mails posted to mailing lists, often
contain incorrect information. We describe how to de-
velop this language resource in section 2, and show a
QA system based on it in section 3.
2 Language resource development
There are mailing lists to which question and answer
mails are posted frequently. For example, to Vine
Users ML, considerable number of question mails and
their answer mails are posted by participants who are
interested in Vine Linux 1. We intended to use these
mails for developing a language resource because we
have the following advantages.
? It is easy to collect question and answer mails in
various domains: The sets of question and answer
mails are necessary to answer how-type questions.
Many informative mails posted to mailing lists are
disclosed in the Internet and can be retrieved by
using full text search engines, such as Namazu
(Namazu). However, users want a more conve-
nient retrieval system than existing systems.
? There are many mails which report the credibility
of their previous mails: Answer mails often con-
tain incorrect solutions. On the other hand, many

mails were submitted by questioners for reporting
the credibility of the solutions which they had re-
ceived. As a result, solutions described in answer
mails can be confirmed by using questioner?s re-
ply mails.
? Mails posted to mailing lists generally have key
sentences: These key sentences can be extracted
by using surface clues (Watanabe 05). The sets of
questions and solutions can be acquired by using
key sentences in question and answer mails. Also,
the solutions are confirmed by using key sen-
tences in questioner?s reply mails. Furthermore,
key sentences in question mails and their neigh-
boring sentences often contain information about
conditions, symptoms, and purpose. These kinds
of information are useful in specifying user?s un-
clear questions.
Figure 1 shows the overview of the language re-
source development. First, by using reference rela-
tions and sender?s email address, mails are classified
into four types: (1) question (Q) mail, (2) direct an-
swer (DA) mail, (3) questioner?s reply (QR) mail, and
(4) others. DA mails are direct answers to the original
questions. Solutions are generally described in the DA
mails. QR mails are questioners? answers to the DA
mails. In the QR mails, questioners often report the

credibility of the solutions described in the DA mails.
Sentences in the Q, DA, and QR mails are transformed
into dependency trees by using JUMAN(JMN 05) and
KNP(KNP 05).
Second, key sentences are extracted from the Q, DA,
and QR mails by using (1) nouns used in the mail sub-
jects, (2) quotation frequency, (3) clue expressions, and
(4) sentence location (Watanabe 05). To evaluate this
method, we selected 100 examples of question mails
and their DA and QR mails in Vine Users ML. The ac-
curacy of the key sentence extraction from the Q, DA,
and QR mails were 80%, 88%, and 76%, respectively.
We associated (1) the key sentences and the neighbor-
ing sentences in the Q mails and (2) the key sentences
in the DA mails. We used them as knowledge for an-
swering how-type questions. 73% of them were coher-
ent explanations.
Third, expressions including information about con-
dition, symptom, and purpose are extracted from the
key sentences in the Q mails and their neighboring sen-
tences by using clue expressions. The results are used
for specifying unclear questions. For example, unclear
question ?oto ga denai (I cannot get any sounds)? is
specified by ?saisho kara (symptom: from the begin-
ning) ?? and ?kernel no version ha (condition: which
kernel version) ??, both of which were extracted from
the Q mails through this semantic analysis. The accu-
racy of this analysis was 74%.
Finally, positive and negative expressions to the so-
lutions described in the DA mails are extracted from
the key sentences in the QR mails. The results of this
analysis on QR mails are used for giving credibility la-
bels to the solutions described in the DA mails. The
accuracy of this analysis was 76%.
3 QA system based on the language resource
Figure 2 shows the overview of our system based on
the language resource. A user can ask a question to the
system in natural language. Then, the system retrieves
similar questions and their solutions, and it shows the
credibility of these solutions by using their credibility
labels. Figure 3 shows an example where our system
gave an answer to user?s question, ?IP wo shutoku dek-
inai (I cannot get an IP address)?; ?positive 1? means
that this answer thread has one solution that was posi-
tively confirmed by its QR mail.
The language resource consists of the mails posted
to Vine Users ML (50846 mails: 8782 Q mails, 13081
Figure 2: System overview
Figure 3: A set of a question and the answers with a

DA mails, 4272 QR mails, and 24711 others). 8782
key sentences and their 7330 previous and 8614 next
sentences were extracted from the Q mails. These sen-
tences were associated with 13081 key sentences ex-
tracted from the DA mails and used as knowledge for
answering how-type questions. 3173 key sentences
were extracted from the QR mails and the credibility
labels (2148 positive and 1025 negative) were given to
3127 key sentences in the DA mails.
The QA processor transforms user?s question into a
dependency structure by using JUMAN(JMN 05) and
KNP(KNP 05). Then, it retrieves similar questions and
their solutions by calculating the similarity scores be-
tween user?s question and key sentencecs in the ques-
tion mails. It also retrieves expressions including in-
formation about conditions, symptoms, and purpose
which seem to be useful in specifying user?s questions.
The user interface enables a user to access to the sys-
tem via a WWW browser by using CGI-based HTML
forms. It puts the answer threads in order of similarity
score.
