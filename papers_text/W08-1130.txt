Abstract
Selection of natural-sounding referring ex-
pressions is useful in text generation and in-
formation summarization (Kan et al, 2001).
We use discourse-level feature predicates in
a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al,
1996) with binary and n-class classification to
select referring expressions from a list. We
find that while mention-type n-class classifi-
cation produces higher accuracy of type, bi-
nary classification of individual referring ex-
pressions helps to avoid use of awkward refer-
ring expressions.
1 Introduction
Referring expression generation is the task of insert-
ing noun phrases that refer to a mentioned extra-
linguistic entity into a text. REG is helpful for tasks
such as text generation and information summariza-
tion (Kan et al, 2001).
2 Task Description
The Referring Expressions Generation Chal-
lenge (Belz and Gatt, 2008) includes a task based
on the GREC corpus, a collection of introductory
texts from Wikipedia that includes articles about
cities, countries, rivers, people, and mountains.
In this corpus, the main topic of each text (MSR)
has been replaced with a list of possible referring
expressions (REs). The objective of the task is to
identify the most appropriate referring expression
from the list for each mention of the MSR, given
the surrounding text and annotated syntactic and
semantic information.
3 Predicates
We created 13 predicates, in addition to the six pred-
icates available with the corpus. All predicates can
be used with the binary classification method; only
non-RE-level predicates can be used with the n-class
classification method. Predicates describe: string
similarity of the RE and the title of the article, the
mention?s order in the article, distance between pre-
vious mention and current mention, and detection of
a contrastive discourse entity in the text.1
4 Maximum Entropy Classifier
We defined indicator feature functions for a number
of contextual predicates, each describing a pairing of
some potential property of the syntactico-semantic
and discourse context of a RE (a ?predicate?) and a
label. These feature functions fi were used to train
a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al, 1996)
(Le, 2004) that assigns a probability to a RE re given
context cx as follows:
p(re | cx) = Z(cx) exp
n?
i=1
?ifi(cx, re)
where Z(cx) is a normalizing sum and the ?i are the
parameters (feature weights) learned. Two classifi-
cation systems were used: binary and n-class. With
the binary method, the classifier estimates the like-
lihood of a possible referring expression?s correct
insertion into the text, and inserts the RE with the
highest ?yes? probability. With the n-class method,

Predicates Used Single Combinations
GREC predicates 40.40% 50.91%
all predicates 50.30% 58.54%
no contrasting entities 50.30% 59.30%
all non-RE-level preds 44.82% 51.07%

the mention is classified according to type of refer-
ring expression (proper name, common noun, pro-
noun, empty) and a RE of the proper type is chosen.
A predicate combinator was implemented to cre-
ate pairs of predicates for the classifier.
5 Results
Our results are shown in tables 1 and 2; table 3
shows further per-category results. N-class classi-
fication has a higher type accuracy than the binary
method(single: 61.13% versus 44.82%). Added
predicates made a notable difference (single, orig-
inal predicates: 40.40%; with added predicates:
50.30%). However, the predicates that detected con-
trasting discourse entities proved not to be helpful
(combinations: 59.30% declined to 58.54%). Fi-
nally, the predicate combinator improved all results
(binary, all predicates: 50.30% to 58.54%).
6 Discussion
The n-class method does not evaluate characteristics
of each individual referring expression. However,
the accuracy measure is designed to judge appro-
priateness of a referring expression based only on
whether its type is correct. A typical high-accuracy
n-class result is shown in example 1.

Example 1: Albania
The Republic of Albania itself is a
Balkan country in Southeastern Europe.
Which itself borders Montenegro to the
north, the Serbian province of Kosovo to
the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia
in the east, and Greece in the south.
In example 1, both mentions are matched with an RE
that is the proper type (proper name and pronoun,
respectively), yet the result is undesireable.
A different example typical of the binary classifi-
cation method is shown in example 2.
Example 2: Alfred Nobel
Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist,
engineer, innovator, armaments manufac-
turer and the inventor of dynamite. [...] In
his last will, Alfred Nobel used his enor-
mous fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.
In example 2, the use of predicates specific to each
RE besides the type causes use of the RE ?Alfred
Nobel? as a subject, and the RE ?his? as a posses-
sive pronoun. The text, if mildly repetitive, is still
comprehensible.
7 Conclusion
In this study, we used discourse-level predicates and
binary and n-class maximum entropy classifiers to
select referring expressions. Eventually, we plan
to combine these two approaches, first selecting all
REs of the appropriate type and then ranking them.
