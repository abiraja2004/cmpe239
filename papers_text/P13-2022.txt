Abstract
This paper presents an annotation scheme
for events that negatively or positively
affect entities (benefactive/malefactive
events) and for the attitude of the writer
toward their agents and objects. Work on
opinion and sentiment tends to focus on
explicit expressions of opinions. However,
many attitudes are conveyed implicitly,
and benefactive/malefactive events are
important for inferring implicit attitudes.
We describe an annotation scheme and
give the results of an inter-annotator
agreement study. The annotated corpus is
available online.
1 Introduction
Work in NLP on opinion mining and sentiment
analysis tends to focus on explicit expressions of
opinions. Consider, however, the following sen-
tence from the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al, 2005)
discussed by (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005):
(1) I think people are happy because
Chavez has fallen.
The explicit sentiment expression, happy, is pos-
itive. Yet (according to the writer), the people
are negative toward Chavez. As noted by (Wil-
son and Wiebe, 2005), the attitude toward Chavez
is inferred from the explicit sentiment toward the
event. An opinion-mining system that recognizes
only explicit sentiments would not be able to per-
ceive the negative attitude toward Chavez con-
veyed in (1). Such inferences must be addressed
for NLP systems to be able to recognize the full
range of opinions conveyed in language.
The inferences arise from interactions be-
tween sentiment expressions and events such as
fallen, which negatively affect entities (malefac-
tive events), and events such as help, which pos-
itively affect entities (benefactive events). While
some corpora have been annotated for explicit
opinion expressions (for example, (Kessler et
al., 2010; Wiebe et al, 2005)), there isn?t a
previously published corpus annotated for bene-
factive/malefactive events. While (Anand and
Reschke, 2010) conducted a related annotation
study, their data are artificially constructed sen-
tences incorporating event predicates from a fixed
list, and their annotations are of the writer?s
attitude toward the events. The scheme pre-
sented here is the first scheme for annotating, in
naturally-occurring text, benefactive/malefactive
events themselves as well as the writer?s attitude
toward the agents and objects of those events.
2 Overview
For ease of communication, we use the terms
goodFor and badFor for benefactive and malefac-
tive events, respectively, and use the abbreviation
gfbf for an event that is one or the other. There are
many varieties of gfbf events, including destruc-
tion (as in kill Bill, which is bad for Bill), cre-
ation (as in bake a cake, which is good for the
cake), gain or loss (as in increasing costs, which
is good for the costs), and benefit or injury (as in
comforted the child, which is good for the child)
(Anand and Reschke, 2010).
The scheme targets clear cases of gfbf events.
The event must be representable as a triple of con-
tiguous text spans, ?agent, gfbf, object?. The
agent must be a noun phrase, or it may be implicit
(as in the constituent will be destroyed). The ob-
ject must be a noun phrase.
120
Another component of the scheme is the influ-
encer, a word whose effect is to either retain or
reverse the polarity of a gfbf event. For example:
(2) Luckily Bill didn?t kill him.
(3) The reform prevented companies
from hurting patients.
(4) John helped Mary to save Bill.
In (2) and (3), didn?t and prevented, respectively,
reverse the polarity from badFor to goodFor (not
killing Bill is good for Bill; preventing companies
from hurting patients is good for the patients). In
(4), helped is an influencer which retains the polar-
ity (i.e., helping Mary to save Bill is good for Bill).
Examples (3) and (4) illustrate the case where an
influencer introduces an additional agent (reform
in (3) and John in (4)).
The agent of an influencer must be a noun
phrase or implicit. The object must be another in-
fluencer or a gfbf event.
Note that, semantically, an influencer can be
seen as good for or bad for its object. A reverser
influencer makes its object irrealis (i.e., not hap-
pen). Thus, it is bad for it. In (3), for example,
prevent is bad for the hurting event. A retainer in-
fluencer maintains its object, and thus is good for
it. In (4), for example, helped maintains the sav-
ing event. For this reason, influencers and gfbf
events are sometimes combined in the evaluations
presented below (see Section 4.2).
Finally, the annotators are asked to mark the
writer?s attitude towards the agents of the influ-
encers and gfbf events and the objects of the gfbf
events. For example:
(5) GOP Attack on Reform Is a Fight
Against Justice.
(6) Jettison any reference to end-of-life
counselling.
In (5), there are two badFor events: ?GOP, Attack
on, Reform? and ?GOP Attack on Reform,Fight
Against, Justice?. The writer?s attitude toward
both agents is negative, and his or her attitude
toward both objects is positive. In (6), the
writer conveys a negative attitude toward end-of-
life counselling. The coding manual instructs the
annotators to consider whether an attitude of the
writer is communicated or revealed in the particu-
lar sentence which contains the gfbf event.
3 Annotation Scheme
There are four types of annotations: gfbf event,
influencer, agent, and object. For gfbf events, the
agent, object, and polarity (goodFor or badFor) are
identified. For influencers, the agent, object and
effect (reverse or retain) are identified. For agents
and objects, the writer?s attitude is marked (posi-
tive, negative, or none). The annotator links agents
and objects to their gfbf and influencer annotations
via explicit IDs. When an agent is not mentioned
explicitly, the annotator should indicate that it is
implicit. For any span the annotator is not certain
about, he or she can set the uncertain option to be
true.
The annotation manual includes guidelines to
help clarify which events should be annotated.
Though it often is, the gfbf span need not be a
verb or verb phrase. We saw an example above,
namely (5). Even though attack on and fight
against are not verbs, we still mark them because
they represent events that are bad for the object.
Note that, Goyal et al (2012) present a method for
automatically generating a lexicon of what they
call patient polarity verbs. Such verbs correspond
to gfbf events, except that gfbf events are, concep-
tually, events, not verbs, and gfbf spans are not
limited to verbs (as just noted).
Recall from Section 2 that annotators should
only mark gfbf events that may be represented as a
triple, ?agent,gfbf,object?. The relationship should
be perceptible by looking only at the spans in the
triple. If, for example, another argument of the
verb is needed to perceive the relationship, the an-
notators should not mark that event.
(7) His uncle left him a massive amount
of debt.
(8) His uncle left him a treasure.
There is no way to break these sentences into
triples that follow our rules. ?His uncle, left, him?
doesn?t work because we cannot perceive the po-
larity looking only at the triple; the polarity de-
pends on what his uncle left him. ?His uncle, left
him, a massive amount of debt? isn?t correct: the
event is not bad for the debt, it is bad for him. Fi-
nally, ?His uncle, left him a massive amount of
debt, Null? isn?t correct, since no object is iden-
tified.
Note that him in (7) and (8) are both consid-
ered benefactive semantic roles (Zu?n?iga and Kit-
tila?, 2010). In general, gfbf objects are not equiva-
121
lent to benefactive/malefactive semantic roles. For
example, in our scheme, (7) is a badFor event and
(8) is a goodFor event, while him fills the benefac-
tive semantic role in both. Further, according to
(Zu?n?iga and Kittila?, 2010), me is the filler of the
benefactive role in She baked a cake for me. Yet,
in our scheme, a cake is the object of the good-
For event; me is not included in the annotations.
The objects of gfbf events are what (Zu?n?iga and
Kittila?, 2010) refer to as the primary targets of the
events, whereas, they state, beneficiary semantic
roles are typically optional arguments. The reason
we annotate only the primary objects (and agents)
is that the clear cases of attitude implicatures mo-
tivating this work (see Section 1) are inferences
toward agents and primary objects of gfbf events.
Turning to influencers, there may be chains of
them, where the ultimate polarity and agent must
be determined compositionally. For example, the
structure of Jack stopped Mary from trying to kill
Bill is a reverser influencer (stopped) whose object
is a retainer influencer (trying) whose object is, in
turn, a badFor event (kill). The ultimate polarity of
this event is goodFor and the ?highest level? agent
is Jack. In our scheme, all such chains of lengthN
are treated as N ? 1 influencers followed by a sin-
gle gfbf event. It will be up to an automatic system
to calculate the ultimate polarity and agent using
rules such as those presented in, e.g., (Moilanen
and Pulman, 2007; Neviarouskaya et al, 2010).
To save some effort, the annotators are not
asked to mark retainer influencers which do not in-
troduce new agents. For example, for Jack stopped
trying to kill Bill, there is no need to mark ?trying.?
Of course, all reverser influencers must be marked.
4 Agreement Study
To validate the reliability of the annotation
scheme, we conducted an agreement study. In this
section we introduce how we designed the agree-
ment study, present the evaluation method and
give the agreement results. Besides, we conduct
a second-step consensus study to further analyze
the disagreement.
4.1 Data and Agreement Study Design
For this study, we want to use data that is rich in
opinions and implicatures. Thus we used the cor-
pus from (Conrad et al, 2012), which consists of
134 documents from blogs and editorials about a
controversial topic, ?the Affordable Care Act?.
To measure agreement on various aspects of
the annotation scheme, two annotators, who are
co-authors, participated in the agreement study;
one of the two wasn?t involved in developing the
scheme. The new annotator first read the anno-
tation manual and discussed it with the first an-
notator. Then, the annotators labelled 6 docu-
ments and discussed their disagreements to recon-
cile their differences. For the formal agreement
study, we randomly selected 15 documents, which
have a total of 725 sentences. These documents do
not contain any examples in the manual, and they
are different from the documents discussed during
training. The annotators then independently anno-
tated the 15 selected documents.
4.2 Agreement Study Evaluation
We annotate four types of items (gfbf event, influ-
encer, agent, and object) and their corresponding
attributes. As noted above in Section 2, influencers
can also be viewed as gfbf events. Also, the two
may be combined together in chains. Thus, we
measure agreement for gfbf and influencer spans
together, treating them as one type. Then we
choose the subset of gfbf and influencer annota-
tions that both annotators identified, and measure
agreement on the corresponding agents and ob-
jects.
Sometimes the annotations differ even though
the annotators recognize the same gfbf event.
Consider the following sentence:
(9) Obama helped reform curb costs.
Suppose the annotations given by the annotators
were:
Ann 1. ?Obama, helped, curb?
?reform, curb, costs?
Ann 2. ?Obama, helped, reform?
The two annotators do agree on the ?Obama,
helped, reform? triple, the first one marking helped
as a retainer and the other marking it as a goodFor
event. To take such cases into consideration in our
evaluation of agreement, if two spans overlap and
one is marked as gfbf and the other as influencer,
we use the following rules to match up their agents
and objects:
? for a gfbf event, consider its agent and object
as annotated;
122
? for an influencer, assign the agent of the in-
fluencer?s object to be the influencer?s object,
and consider its agent as annotated and the
newly-assigned object. In (9), Ann 2?s anno-
tations remain the same and Ann 1?s become
?Obama, helped, reform? and ?reform, curb,
costs?.
We use the same measurement for agreement
for all types of spans. Suppose A is a set of an-
notations of a particular type and B is the set of
annotations of the same type from the other anno-
tator. For any text span a ? A and b ? B, the span
coverage c measures the overlap between a and b.
Two measures of c are adopted here.
Binary: As in (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), if two
spans a and b overlap, the pair is counted as 1,
otherwise 0.
c1(a, b) = 1 if |a ? b| > 0
Numerical: (Johansson and Moschitti, 2013)
propose, for the pairs that are counted as 1 by c1, a
measure of the percentage of overlapping tokens,
c2(a, b) =
|a ? b|
|b|
where |a| is the number of tokens in span a, and ?
gives the tokens that two spans have in common.
As (Breck et al, 2007) point out, c2 avoids the
problem of c1, namely that c1 does not penalize a
span covering the whole sentence, so it potentially
inflates the results.
Following (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), treat-
ing each set A and B in turn as the gold-
standard, we calculate the average F-measure, de-
noted agr(A,B). agr(A,B) is calculated twice,
once with c = c1 and once with c = c2.
match(A,B) =
?
a?A,b?B,
|a?b|>0
c(a, b)
agr(A||B) = match(A,B)|B|
agr(A,B) = agr(A||B) + agr(B||A)2
Now that we have the sets of annotations on
which the annotators agree, we use ? (Artstein
and Poesio, 2008) to measure agreement for the
attributes. We report two ? values: one for the
polarities of the gfbf events, together with the ef-
fects of the influencers, and one for the writer?s

attitude toward the agents and objects. Note that,
as in Example (9), sometimes one annotator marks
a span as gfbf and the other marks it as an influ-
encer; in such cases we regard retain and goodfor
as the same attribute value and reverse and badfor
as the same value. Table 1 gives the agr values
and Table 2 gives the ? values.
4.3 Agreement Study Results
Recall that the annotator could choose whether
(s)he is certain about the annotation. Thus, we
evaluate two sets: all annotations and only those
annotations that both annotators are certain about.
The results are shown in the top four rows in Table
1.
The results for agents and objects in Table 1 are
all quite good, indicating that, given a gfbf or in-
fluencer, the annotators are able to correctly iden-
tify the agent and object.
Table 1 also shows that results are not signifi-
cantly worse when measured using c2 rather than
c1. This suggests that, in general, the annotators
have good agreement concerning the boundaries
of spans.
Table 2 shows that the ? values are high for both
sets of attributes.
4.4 Consensus Analysis
Following (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007), we ex-
amined what percentage of disagreement is due to
negligence on behalf of one or the other annota-
tor (i.e., cases of clear gfbfs or influencers that
were missed), though we conducted our consensus
123
study in a more independent manner than face-to-
face discussion between the annotators. For anno-
tator Ann1, we highlighted sentences for which
only Ann2 marked a gfbf event, and gave Ann1?s
annotations back to him or her with the highlights
added on top. For Ann2 we did the same thing.
The annotators reconsidered their highlighted sen-
tences, making any changes they felt they should,
without communicating with each other. There
could be more than one annotation in a highlighted
sentence; the annotators were not told the specific
number.
After re-annotating the highlighted sentences,
we calculate the agreement score for all the an-
notations. As shown in the last two rows in Table
1, the agreement for gfbf and influencer annota-
tions increases quite a bit. Similar to the claim
in (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007), it is reasonable
to conclude that the actual agreement is approx-
imately lower bounded by the initial values and
upper bounded by the consensus values, though,
compared to face-to-face consensus, we provide a
tighter upper bound.
5 Corpus and Examples
Recall from in Section 4.1 that we use the corpus
from (Conrad et al, 2012), which consists of 134
documents with a total of 8,069 sentences from
blogs and editorials about ?the Affordable Care
Act?. There are 1,762 gfbf and influencer annota-
tions. On average, more than 20 percent of the sen-
tences contain a gfbf event or an influencer. Out of
all gfbf and influencer annotations, 40 percent are
annotated as goodFor or retain and 60 percent are
annotated as badFor or reverse. For agents and ob-
jects, 52 percent are annotated as positive and 47
percent as negative. Only 1 percent are annotated
as none, showing that almost all the sentences (in
this corpus of editorials and blogs) which con-
tain gfbf annotations are subjective. The annotated
corpus is available online1.
To illustrate various aspects of the annotation
scheme, in this section we give several examples
from the corpus. In the examples below, words
in square brackets are agents or objects, words in
italics are influencers, and words in boldface are
gfbf events.
1. And [it] will enable [Obama and the
Democrats] - who run Washington - to get
1http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/
back to creating [jobs].
(a) Creating is goodFor jobs; the agent is
Obama and the Democrats.
(b) The phrase to get back to is a retainer in-
fluencer. But, the agent span is also Obama
and the Democrats, as the same with the
goodFor, so we don?t have to give an anno-
tation for it.
(c) The phrase enable is a retainer influencer.
Since its agent span is different (namely, it),
we do create an annotation for it.
2. [Repealing [the Affordable Care Act]] would
hurt [families, businesses, and our econ-
omy].
(a) Repealing is a badFor event since it de-
prives the object, the Affordable Care Act, of
its existence. In this case the agent is implicit.
(b) The agent of the badFor event hurt is the
whole phrase Repealing the Affordable Care
Act. Note that the agent span is in fact a noun
phrase (even though it refers to an event).
Thus, it doesn?t break the rule that all agent
gfbf spans should be noun phrases.
3. It is a moral obligation to end this indefensi-
ble neglect of [hard-working Americans].
(a) This example illustrates a gfbf that cen-
ters on a noun (neglect) rather than on a verb.
(b) It also illustrates the case when two words
can be seen as gfbf events: both end and ne-
glect of can be seen as badFor events. Fol-
lowing our specification, they are annotated
as a chain ending in a single gfbf event: end
is an influencer that reverses the polarity of
the badFor event neglect of.
6 Conclusion
Attitude inferences arise from interactions
between sentiment expressions and benefac-
tive/malefactive events. Corpora have been
annotated in the past for explicit sentiment ex-
pressions; this paper fills in a gap by presenting
an annotation scheme for benefactive/malefactive
events and the writer?s attitude toward the agents
and objects of those events. We conducted an
agreement study, the results of which are positive.
