DEEP CASES FOR ADVERBIAL AND PREPOSITIOI~AL PHRASES

This paper attempts to demonstrate the use fu lness  fo r  
Machine Trans la t ion  of a case-or iented  escr ip t ion  of the syn-  
tac t i c  and the semantic behavior  of adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  
const ruct ions .  
Ee aim to modify and re f ine  the ex is t ing  descr ip t iohs  of 
adverbs and prepos i t iona l  phrases in  order  to put them to 
e f f i c ient  use in  Machine Trans la t ion .  We hope to po in t  out ,  
fur thermore,  the des i rab i l i ty  of incorporat ing  deep case in -  
fo rmat ion  in to  the " in ter face  s t ruc ture"  of a Machine Trans -  
la t ion  system. 
I. Task-svecific requirements on parsing 
Pars ing  sentences  fo r  t rans la t ion  purposes i s  bound to 
differ i~ significant ways from parsing natural language for 
other tasks. In this paragraph, we will formulate a n,,mbar of 
translation-speclfio requirements on natural language analy- 
sis which, moreover, will be of particular interest in the 
discussion of the issues in the following paragraphs. 
2. Surface cases, deep cases and conceptual caqes 
A much debated issue in AI is the desirable depth of the 
case system employed In natural language understanding 
programs. From the preceding paragraph, however, it will have 
become apparent that, in Machine Translation, one could better

make use of  var ious  case systems of  inc reas ing  depth.  In  
th i s  paragraph,  we w i l l  be concerned wi th  the de f in i t ion  of  
the th ree  types of  oases we cons ider  to  be adequate fo r  t rans -  
la t iona l  purposes:  ( i )  sur face  cases  re f lec t  the dependency 
re la t ion~ which ex is t  between const i tuents  and the i r  gover -  
nors ;  ( i i )  deep cases  prov ide  in fo rmat ion  about the va lency  
boundnese of  the par t i c ipants  in  the pred icat ion ;  ( i l i )  con-  
ceptus l  cases  are language- independent  va lues  which g ive  in -  
fo rmat ion  about the s ta tes  of  a f fa i r s  people ta lk  about .  
3. Deep ca~eq fo r  adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  phrases  
I t  i s  common pract i ce  in  va lency grammar to  ass ign  the 
proper t ies  + valency-bound or - va lency-bound to  const i tuents .  
We hope to show that  th i s  dichotomy i s  inadequate  fo r  dea l ing  
wi th  natura l  language in  genera l ,  and wi th  adverb ia l  end pre -  
pos i t iona l  phrases in  par t i cu la r .  The d i scuss ion  w i l l  aim at  
in t roduc ing  a th i rd  proper ty  to the set  of  deep cases  ccmnonly 
used: the " t renspropos i t iona l  case ?. 
The main par t  of  th i s  Sect ion  w i l l  be devoted to the de-  
f in i t ion  of  the t ranspropos i t iona l  case .  We w i l l  po in t  out the 
descr ip t ive  and computat iona l  advantages of  the th ree-case  
system proposed,  on the bas i s  of  examples.  This w i l l  lead  to a 
c lass i f i ca t ion  of  adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  const ruc t ions  
which d i f fe rs  in  a cons iderab le  way from the one t rad i t iona l ly  
used in  l ingu is t i cs .  F~ther  a t tent ion  w i l l  be expended to  
const ruc t ions  o ther  than adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  ones,  
which should as we l l  be labe led  t rsnspropoe i t iona l .  
4. Conc lus ion 
In  the f ina l  paragraph,  we w i l l  b r ie f ly  sketch  the need 
of in t roduc ing  the t ranspropos i t iona l  case in to  the set  o f  
deep case relations, by showing that its omission would lead 
to bad translations.
