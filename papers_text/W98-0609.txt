Automatic Collection and Analysis of GermanCompounds 
John Goldsmith 
The University of Chicago 
Summary: In this paper we report on an 
exploration of noun-noun compounds in a large 
German corpus. The morphological parsing 
providing the analysis of words into stems and 
suffixes was entirely data-driven, in that no 
knowledge of Ge:man was used to determine 
what the correct set of stems and suffixes was, 
nor how to break any given word into its 
component morphemes. To discover 
compounds, however, we used our prior 
knowledge of the structure of German nominal 
compounds, in a way that we will describe in 
greater length below. 
The interest of this case derives from the fact 
that German compounds (unlike English 
compounds, but like those in many other 
languages, especially in the Indo-European 
family) include a linking element (Fugenelement 
in German) placed between the two stems. 
Traditional grammars report nine possible linker 
elements: e, es, en, er, n, ens, ns, s, and zero (see 
Duden 1995), and report as well that the Left 
Element determines which choice of linking 
element is appropriate for a given nominal 
compound.' 
1. Introduction 
This project began with both a general and a 
very specific goalJ One of the authors is 
currently developing a morphological analyzer 
that takes a large corpus as its input and returns 
a morphological analysis based on that corpus 
(see Goldsmith (in prep.)). Most of. the 
morphological activity in European languages

involves suffix-attachment o stems, but 
languages uch as German and Dutch require 
that serious attention be paid to the prefix 
system, and an even wider range of languages 
(including both German and Dutch, but also 
such varied languages as English and Finnish) 
require an analysis of compounds. 
The general goal, then, was to implement a 
compound-analyzer in the context of the 
unsupervised acquisition of morphology. The 
specific goal was to use this analysis to 
determine the linking element (see below) used 
by each member of the German lexicon that 
engages in compound formation as a Left 
Element. 
2. The challenge of compounds 
In general, the analyst cannot know whether a 
given language forms its compounds with fully 
inflected words or with stems (that is, inflected 
words minus the inflectional suffix), but the 
latter is by far the most common pattern. The 
challenge, then, is to determine whether an 
analysis of the non-compound words in a corpus 
will give rise to a sufficient inventory of stems 
(in the correct surface form, so to speak) so that 
actual compounds found in the corpus can be 
identified as concatenation of two such stems, 
possibly separated by a linker element chosen 
from a very small inventory. At the same time, it 
is critical that the analysis not Over-recognize 
compounds, that is, that it not "recognize" 
compounds that are not there - an error that will 
typically arise if there exist true stems that are 
homographs of suffixes, or of subparts of 
suffixes. We have labelled this problem the 
Schweinerei problem (from Schweinerei "mess" 
\[lit., pig + erei nominal derivational suffix\]) 
because the word can be misanalyzed as a 
compound incorporating the linker er and the 
Right Element Ei "egg". 
In addition, the challenge of identifying 
compounds raises the question as to whether 
there is a clear distinction to be drawn (in 
61 
German, and in other languages as well) 
between a (prefix + stem) structure and a 
compound (stem + stem) structure. Duden 1995, 
for example, characterizes one use of Haupt 
"head" as a prefix (e.g., in Hauptstadt "capital"), 
based, presumably, on the semantic bleaching 
that often accompanies long-time use of a word 
in various compounds. English has similar uses 
of the stem head, with cases ranging from head 
teacher, written with a space and in which the 
element head contributes a very clear semantics 
even though it has almost nothing to do with the 
original sense of head, all the way to headline, 
where the meaning of the word is barely, if at 
all, decomposable into two parts. In our work we 
have employed the definition of affix that is 
integrated into our automatic morphological 
analyzer, which is the following: after 
establishing a tentative set of candidate affixes, 
a set of affixes is identified which occurs with 
each given stem (a distinct set of prefixes and 
suffixes). If exactly the same set (of two or 
more suffixes) is used by two or more stems, 
then that set of affixes is "approved", and the 
affixes are definitively identified as affixes 
(rather than as compounds, for example). 
3. The challenge of German 
compounds 
Compounding in German is common, ranging 
from the v~ry frequent formation of compound 
nouns to the less common but also productive 
formation of compound verbs and adjectives) 
Multisegmented compounds, such as 
Anwendungsprogrammschnittstelle "app ications 
program interface", can be viewed as recursively 
applied binary compounds 
( \[ \[Anwendung "application" + Programm 
"program"\] + Schnittstelle "interface"\] ). We 
will refer to the element on the left of such a 
binary structure as the Left Element, the element 
on the right as the Right Element, and the 
sequence of linking characters used to join the 
Left Element and Right Element as the LinkerP 
2 See Duden 1995 
3 We use this linguistically neutral terminology in 
order to emphasize the automatic, concatenative 
nature of the text processing described here. In 
general, for noun-noun compounds, Left Element, 
In our example, the Linker s joins Anwendung 
and Programm, whilst the null Linker joins 
Anwendungsprogramm andSchnittstelle. 
In German, the Linkers are e, es, en, er, n, ens, 
ns, s, and the zero morpheme nu//. In general, 
the Left Element, Linker, and Right Element are 
simply concatenated (Bewegung "movement" +
s + Achse "axis" = Bewegungsachse "axis of 
rotation"), although the Left Element is 
occasionally umlauted. (Huhn "hen" + er + ei 
"egg" = Hiihnerei "hen's egg")? 
A hyphen can be used to emphasize the 
point of linkage between the Left 
Element+Lhlker and the Right Element. This 
effectively doubles the number of Linkers we 
consider, i.e. we add (e- es- en- er- n- ens- ns- s- 
and -) to our list. Duden 1995 reports that the 
hyphen is prescribed if the Left Element is an 
abbreviation and generally present if the Left 
Element is a proper name, and otherwise, it is 
generally employed to improve readability or to 
emphasize the individual components of the 
compound. Our actual results confirm some of 
these guidelines but also yield data that seem not 
to be covered by the guidelines. The leading 
hyphenated Left Elements in our data, for 
example, are (in order): US-, Tang-, and Ballett-. 
Ballett is neither an abbreviation or a proper 
name, nor does it seem that it leads to especially 
unreadable compounds; nevertheless, it is near 
the top of the list. 
If the Left Element ends in the suffix -e or -en, 
this suffix is sometimes dropped (Schule 
"school" + Kind "child" = Schulkind "school- 
age child") 5. But there is another view of 
compounding in which no subtraction occurs. 
Rather, the form without the -e o r -en  (e.g. 
Linker, and Right Element correspond to the German 
terms Bestimmungsworr, Fugenelement, and 
Grundwort, or to the English terms determinant, 
connecting morpheme, and head. 
4 Umlauting of the Left Element (e.g. 
Land+Spiel=LA'nderspiel) can occur in conjunction 
with the null linker, the Linker e, and the Linker er. 
In these cases, the resulting form coincides 
orthographically with the plural form, but is not 
necessarily semantically motivated as a plural; see 
e.g. Duden 1995. 
5 Zepi6 1970, borrowing from Charles Hockett, refers 
to these as subtractive morphs.

schul) is the stem: Our corpus processing 
returns uch suffixless tems. Furthermore, the 
stems returned by corpus processing can contain 
umlauts. In our task at hand of automatically 
assigning a linker distribution to lexicalized 
nouns, we simply have to add the -e o r -en  
suffix and/or deumlaut he suffix to find the 
lexicalized noun for which we wish to determine 
a distribution of Linkers (schul -> schule; l~ind -
> land). 
In general, the choice of a Linker (as well as 
umlauting and desuffixing) is determined by the 
Left Element: 
Part-of-speech ombinations of the Left Element 
and Right Element include noun-noun, noun- 
verb, verb-noun, adjective-noun, noun-adjective, 
etc. In this paper we are only concerned with 
noun-noun compounds, i.e. ones whose Left 
Element and Right Element are both lexicalized 
nouns. Non-nominal Left Elements exhibit 
fairly trivial Linker distributions: 
Previous studies of automatic treatment of 
German compounds have not dealt with the 
treatment of the Linker element. Geutner 1995 
describes the effect on a speech recognition 
system of the recognition of compounding in 
German as a productive and significant process. 
He notes that treatment of compounds decreases 
a substantial part of the nagging out-of- 
vocabulary problem, a major part of the cause 
for OOV being more significant in German than 
in English. Berton et al 1996 also describe work 
6 This view is strongly linguistically motivated. 
Recognizing schul as a stem, for example, illustrates 
the relationship between Schule and schulen. 
Similarly, treating fried as a stem motivates Frieden, 
friedlich, befriedigen, etc. 
7 Some Left Elements govern multiple linking 
sequences. Consider, for example, Tag-e-buch "day 
+ book = diary" vs. Tag-es-themen "day + topics = 
news items", which share the Left Element Tag 
"day". This is why we wish to calculate a Linker 
distribution, not just a single Linker, for each noun 
used as a Left Element. 
s For verbs, the bare stem, i.e. the form without the 
infinitival -(e)n suffix is used with the null Linker, 
e.g. sprechen + Stunde = Sprechstunde. Adjectives 
are generally used as Left Elements in their 
uninflected positive form (Rotkehlchen) and 
occasionally in the superlative form (see e.g. Duden 
1995). 
aimed at improving OOV responses of a speech 
recognition system by allowing the language- 
model to include compounds. Results of that 
experiment showed that in the context of speech 
recognition, the addition of compounding (along 
with the removal of the compounds from the 
lexicon) could decrease the performance of the 
system, especially in the case where the 
compound was of high frequency, and the case 
where one of the compounds was phonologically 
short. 
Our goals were formulated in the context of a 
system which must be equally robust in the 
context of analysis and generation; furthermore, 
we set out to obtain information that could be 
placed in our lexicon, but the analysis of 
compounds that we used did not need to be 
performed in real-time together with a user's 
speech or keyboard input. On the other hand, we 
set quite stringent targets for the correctness of 
the materials that we obtain. 
4. Linker distributions 
To overcome the out-of-vocabulary problem, 
German natural language processing systems 
must accommodate compounds. Encoding in 
the lexicon for each noun a statistical 
distribution of Linkers governed by that noun 
when it is used as a Left Element provides the 
requisite lexical support. 9 This information is 
critical for the generation of compound words 
and can increase the precision of compound 
analysis. We believe that this lexical approach is 
preferable to a rule-driven one both for 
computational efficiency and because the rules 
governing the selection of a Linker are tempered 
by such wide-ranging factors as gender, word- 
length, phonology, diachrony, ~and dialectal 
variation ~o and are fraught with exceptions. 
Our broad-coverage German natural language 
processing system includes a lexicon with over 
140,000 entries, including approximately 
100,000 nouns, none of which contained Linker 
distribution information prior to our 
9 For example, if in an examined corpus, the noun 
Staat were used 96 times with the Linker s, and 12 
times with the Linker en, we would calculate the 
distribution ( p(-s)=0.89; p(-en)=0.11 ). 
1o See, for example, ~epid 1970

undertaking. Our goal was to identify stems and 
suffixes in a large German corpus, then post- 
process the results to yield Linker distributions 
for a large number of nouns in our lexicon. This 
goal was largely met. Both the stem/suffix 
identification and the subsequent post- 
processing were implemented to run fully 
automatically, so that the process can be applied 
to an arbitrarily large corpus, yielding 
distributions for a maximal number of 
lexicalized nouns. 
5. Procedures 
We now summarize the steps involved in first 
morphologically processing a corpus to detect 
stems and suffix, then using the stem/suffix 
information to find compounds, and finally post- 
processing the compound list to calculate Linker 
distributions for the nouns used as Left 
Elements. 
Since the object of our inquiry has been noun- 
noun compounds, and since German nouns are 
capitalized, we restricted our processing to 
words in the corpus beginning with a capital 
letter. We therefore fii-st applied our automatic 
morphological analyzer to the first 300,000 
capitalized words in Microsoft's Encarta, an 
encyclopedia, to establish a list of 8,426 noun 
stems. These are identified by first automatically 
extracting the productive suffixes in the corpus; 
74 were identified, in frequency dominated by 
the top si,g suffixes (en, e, er, s, ung, n); see 
Table 1) 1 
When the algorithm identifies two distinct words 
as composed of the same stem followed by 
different suffixes, it accepts that stern as 
legitimate. For example, the string beobacht- 
(stem for "watch") is identified as a stem 
because it appears in the corpus with the 
following five suffixes: -e re ' -e r / -e rs / -ung/ -  
tmgen. In addition, if a potential stem occurs as a 
free-standing word, we consider that to count as 
an appearance of the stem with a null suffix. For 
example, the stem Alaska "Alaska" appears with 
l, We note that four "suffixes" identified by this 
procedure are in fact from compounds: -land, - 
szentrum, -produktion, and -sgebiet. Given our 
algorithm for determing suffixes, it follows that such 
errors will occur less often as we move to larger 
corpora. In addition, these spurious uffixes are also 
classified as stems. 
three "suffixes": -s, -n, and Null. Thus any 
freestanding word which also appears with at 
least one(independently determined) suffix 
counts as a stem for our purposes. See Table 2. 
Table 2 illustrates the fact that this procedure 
includes in our list of stems noun compounds 
that are found in the corpus with more than one 
suffix. This is not a problem, and in fact is a 
good thing, because, as we noted above, 
compounds are frequently recursively composed 
out of pieces which are themselves compounds. 
With this list of stems in hand, we revisit the 
original corpus, checking each entry now for the 
possibility of one or more parses as compounds. 
Given the set of linkers (established in advance, 
as we have noted), we can very simply review 
each word to see if it can be parsed as the 
concatenation f an item from the list of stems + 
one of the linkers + another item from the list of 
stems + one of the 74 recognized suffixes. All 
forms that can be so parsed are added to a list of 
compounds found; in our corpus, we found 5522 
compounds, based on 3866 distinct First 
Element stems. For each distinct FirstElement 
stem, we produce a record of the form: 
( Left Stem, Linker { Exemplart, 
Exemplar, . . . . .  Exemplar, } ) 
where each Exemplar is the Right Element of a 
compound, and is i:self of the form (Stem + 
Suffix ). 
Next, the compounds are filtered so that they 
only include unambiguous noun-noun 
compounds. This filtering processed is 
described in the following section. Finally, the 
filtered set of data is used to calculate a 
distribution of Linker governance for each 
surviving Left Stem. 
6. Filtering 
In a compound such as Anwendungsprograrnme 
(anwendung + s + programm + e), we call a 
(Left Stem + Suffix) pair such as (anwendung +
s) a candidate, while a (Right Stem + Suffix) 
pair like (programm + e) is called an exemplar. 
Thus, our set of compounds is logically of the 
form: 
( Candidate, { Exemplart, Exemplar,_,... , 
Exemplar, } ) 
For example, if the corpus contains 
Anwendungsprogramm "applications program" 
64 
and Anwendungsprograrame, "applications 
G ~ , l  proorams , then we would have the item 
( (anwendung + s), { (programm + null), 
(programra + e) ... }) 
Since our specific goal is to produce Linker 
distribution information for nouns used as the 
Left Element in noun-noun compounds, we must 
now filter this raw data so that we end up with 
candidates and associated exemplars that are 
unambiguously involved in noun-noun 
compounding. This filtering process is now 
described. 
In order to calculate meaningful inker 
distributions, the raw data must first be passed 
through aseries of simple filters. 
Step 1 Left stems which are not the stems of 
lexicalized nouns are excluded. The stem and 
the lexicalized words may differ with regard to 
umlauting, and in addition the lexicalized word 
may contain the -e/-en suffL~. For example, the 
left stems schul and land correspond to the 
lexical entries Schule and Land, and are thus not 
excluded. But this step does properly exclude 
e.g. the candidate ab+null since ab is not a noun, 
obviating compounds like Abzug and Abbildung. 
Step 2. Left stems with multiple parts of 
speech are excluded. For example, gut can be an 
adjective ("good") or a noun ("property"). Since 
German compounds can be built with e.g. a verb 
or adjective as the Left Element, we cannot 
automatically determine whether a compound 
starting with the Left Element gut is combining 
the adjective or the noun. We therefore 
eliminate the candidate gut + null. 12 
A special instance of excluding multiple parts of 
speech is the case of verb stems. When a verb is 
used as the Left Element of a compound, the 
verb stem, i.e. the infinitive without the final 
(e)n, is used. This leads to a number of 
ambiguous Left Elements such as bhtt (noun 
Bhtt = "blood"; verb bluten = "bleed") and block 
(noun Block = "block"; verb blocken = "block"), 
which are excluded, since it cannot be 
automatically determined whether the 
compounding is based upon the verb stem or the 
homographic noun. 
Step 3. Cases in which the division between 
the Left Stem and the Linker is ambiguous are 
12 These, and other ambiguous cases, are logged to a 
file for possible later manual review. 
excluded. For example, the candidate mark 
"mark" + en, with exemplars such as 
Weltmeister+schafi "world championship" and 
nam+e "name", is excluded, since there is an 
alternate division: marke "brand"+n. 13
Step 4. Combinations of Left Stem and 
Linker in which the final character of the Left 
Stem and the initial character of the Linker are 
identical are excluded. 
This is for phonological reasons, and applies 
both to vowels and consonants. Thus, the 
candidate boden with the exemplar es+ter is 
properly rejected, as is industrie "industry" + er, 
with exemplars like (zeugnisse, null). 14 
These first four filters remove invalid and/or 
ambiguous candidates; next, a few more filters 
are applied to remove invalid and/or ambiguous 
exemplars. If this filtering of exemplars results 
in a candidate being left with no valid 
exemplars, then the candidate is of course 
removed from the list. 
Step 5. Exemplars whose stem is not a 
lexicalized noun are excluded. This is a 
reasonable filtering step, since we are interested 
in noun-noun compounds. The exemplar bella + 
null (associated with the candidate Ara "parrot" 
+ null), derived from the compound Arabella, 
for example, is excluded in this step. 
Step 6. Exemplars in which the division 
between the Stem and the Suffix is ambiguous 
are excluded. For example, the exemplar kamm 
"comb" + er (associated e.g. with the candidate 
architekt "architect" +en) is ambiguous with the 
exemplar kammer "chamber" + null, and is 
therefore xcluded. 
Step 7. Cases in which the division between 
the Linker and the Suffix is ambiguous are 
excluded. Consider the candidate Abfall "trash" 
+ er, associated with the exemplar fassung 
13 In this example, the alternate division is the 
linguistically motivated one. 
14 The proper parse of the compound 
Industr~eerzeugnisse  Industrie+null+erzeugnis+se 
"industry products", not Industrie+er+zeugnis+se 
"*industry certificates". Similarily, Bodennester is 
parsed Boden+null+nest+er "ground nests", not 
Boden+n+ester+null "ground ester". Note that 
excluding the candidates industrie+er and boden+n 
does not affect the candidates industrie+null and 
boden+null. 
65 
"fixture" + null. The exemplar is excluded, 
since there is an alternate division of linker and 
stem: abfall "trash" +mdl,  with the exemplar 
erfassung "acquisition" + null. Another 
example of this kind of ambiguity is Blut-s-tau 
vs. Blut-stau, -- that is, Bhtt "blood"+s 
associated with Tart "dew" + null over against 
Blut "blood" + null associated with Stau 
"congestion" +null. 
Step 8. Cases in which the entire compound, 
i.e. candidate plus exemplar, is lexicalized are 
excluded. For example, there is a candidate Ara 
"parrot" + null associated with the exemplar Rat 
"council" + null. The exemplar is excluded, 
however, since the candidate plus the exemplar 
yields Ararat "Ararat", which is lexicalized. 
A small amount of noise survives the filtering 
process. For example, the Linker ns is 
improperly included in the linker distribution of 
the noun Ar, based on the proper noun Arnsberg, 
which resembles a compound noun: Ar-ns-berg. 
This minimal amount of noise is further educed 
by thresholding: Any candidate (Left Element 
+ Linker) for which there is only one remaining 
exemplar does not contribute to the distribution. 
After this final filtering, the surviving (Left 
Element + Linker) candidates and their 
associated surviving exemplars are used to 
calculate linker distributions for each Left 
Element. 
Of the 8,49_6 candidates entering the filtering 
and thresholding process, 1361 of them survive. 
Of these, 20 share a common Left Element with 
another candidatetS; thus we are able to calculate 
a Linker distribution for 1341 lexicalized nouns. 
7. Linker Distributions 
The filtering described in the previous section 
yields a set of reliable candidates and exemplars 
for noun-noun compounding. For example, 
( (anwendung + s), { (programm + null), 
(programm + e) ... }) survives the filtering 
process. 
Based on these vetted candidates and exemplars, 
we now calculate a Linker governance 
distribution for lexicalized nouns used as the 
Left Element of a noun-noun compound. 
t5 For example, the candidates Stand+null and 
Stand+es share the Left Stem Stand. 
First, from each set of exemplars associated with 
a given candidate, we squeeze out the exemplars 
with a common stem. In our example, the 
exemplar (prograram + e) is removed, since the 
exemplar (prograrnm + mdl) is also associated 
with the candidate (anwendung +s). 
Next, for each Left Stem, we simply tally the 
total number T of exemplars associated with that 
Left Stem. Then, for each Linker associated 
with Left Stem, we calculate its probability by 
tallying the number of exemplars associated 
with the candidate (Left Stem + Linker), then 
dividing by T. 
We wish to incorporate this data into our lexicon 
as follows. For each noun entry N, derive the 
distribution D(N) of Linkers governed by N ~6. 
For example, for the entry Staat, the distribution 
( en = 0.I I; s = 0.89 ) is calculated. 
8. Conclusions 
Our goal in this effort has been to evaluate and, 
ultimately, to use for practical ends the analysis 
of large-scale German corpora in order to 
determine a morphological property of 
individual German noun stems -- the choice of 
Linker element used in compounding. 
Our results support he strategy of using large- 
scale natural language corpora as a source for 
automatic processing and as a means to gather 
specific lexical information. While linker 
information is sparsely distributed across the 
corpora we have studied, the largely automatic 
character of our search allows us to have 
increasingly certain information about this 
property. 
16 The number of noun entries for which any 
distribution is calculated is, of course, dependent 
upon the corpus processed. Every step of processing 
described in this paper is fully automated, so that an 
arbitrarily large corpus can be processed, limited only 
by computational resources.
