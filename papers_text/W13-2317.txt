Abstract
This paper presents the DATOOL, a graph-
ical tool for annotating conversations con-
sisting of short messages (i.e., tweets), and
the results we obtain in using it to annotate
tweets for Darija, an historically unwritten
Arabic dialect spoken by millions but not
taught in schools and lacking standardiza-
tion and linguistic resources.
With the DATOOL, a native-Darija
speaker annotated hundreds of mixed-
language and mixed-script conversations
at approximately 250 tweets per hour. The
resulting corpus was used in developing
and evaluating Arabic dialect classifiers
described briefly herein.
The DATOOL supports downstream dis-
course analysis of tweeted ?conversations?
by mapping extracted relations such as,
who tweets to whom in which language,
into graph markup formats for analysis in
network visualization tools.
1 Overview
For historically unwritten languages, few textual
resources exist for developing NLP applications
such as machine translation engines. Even when
audio resources are available, difficulties arise
when converting sound to text (Robinson and
Gadelii, 2003). Increasingly, however, with the
widespread use of mobile phones, these languages
are being written in social media such as Twitter.
Not only can these languages be written in multi-
ple scripts, but conversations, and even individual
messages, often involve multiple languages. To
build useful textual resources for documenting and
translating these languages (e.g., bilingual dictio-
naries), tools are needed to assist in language an-
notation for this noisy, multiscript, multilingual
form of communication.
This paper presents the Dialect Annotation Tool
(DATOOL), a graphical tool for annotating conver-
sations consisting of short messages (i.e., tweets),
and the results we obtain in using it to annotate
tweets for Darija, an historically unwritten North
African Arabic dialect spoken by millions but not
taught in schools and lacking in standardardiza-
tion and linguistic resources. The DATOOL can
retrieve the conversation for each tweet on a user?s
timeline or via Apollo (Le et al, 2011) and display
the discourse, enabling annotators to make more
informed decisions. It has integrated classifiers for
automatically annotating data so a user can either
verify or alter the automatically-generated annota-
tions rather than start from scratch. The tool can
also export annotated data to GEPHI (Bastian et
al., 2009), an open source network visualization
tool with many layout algorithms, which will fa-
cilitate future ?code-switching? research.
2 Tool Description
2.1 Version 1.0
The first version of the tool is depicted in Figure
1. It is capable of loading a collection of tweets
and extracting the full conversations they belong
to. Each conversation is displayed within its own
block in the conversation display table. An anno-
tator can mark multiple tweets as Darija (or other
language) by selecting multiple checkboxes in the
lefthand side of the table. Also, if a tweet is writ-
ten in multiple languages, the annotator can anno-
tate the different sections using the Message text
box below the conversation display table.
The tool also calculates user and collection level
summary statistics, which it displays below the
main annotation section.
We worked with a Darija-speaking annotator
during the tool?s development, who provided
valuable feedback, helping to shape the overall
design of the tool and improve its functionality.

Data Annotation Using version 1.0, the annotator
marked up 3013 tweets from 3 users for the pres-
ence of the Darija (approximately 1,000 per user),
averaging about 250 tweets per hour. Of the 1,400
tweets with Arabic script, 1,013 contained Darija.
This annotated data is used to evaluate the Arabic
dialect classifier discussed in Section 3.
2.2 Version 2.0
The second version of the tool contains the ad-
ditional ability to invoke pre-trained classification
models to automatically annotate tweets. The tool
displays the classifier?s judgment confidence next
to each tweet, and the user can set a minimal con-
fidence threshold, below which automatic annota-
tions are hidden. Figure 2 illustrates the new clas-
sification functionality.
2.3 XML Output
The DATOOL stores data in an XML-based for-
mat that can be reloaded for continuing or re-
vising annotation. It can also export four differ-
ent views of the data in Graph Exchange XML
Format (GEXF), a format that can be read by
GEPHI. In the social network view, users are
represented by nodes, and tweets are represented
as directed edges between the nodes. The in-
formation network view displays tweets as nodes
with directed edges between time-ordered tweets
within a conversation. In the social-information
network view, both users and tweets are repre-
sented by nodes, and there are directed edges both
from tweet senders to their tweets and from tweets
to recipients. The social-information network plus
view provides all the information of both the so-
cial network and the information network.
3 Classifier
For the second version of the DATOOL, we inte-
grated an Arabic dialect classifier capable of dis-
tinguishing among Darija, Egyptian, Gulf, Lev-
antine and MSA with the goal of improving the
speed and consistency of the annotation process.
Though language classification is sometimes
viewed as a solved problem (McNamee, 2005),
with some experiments achieving over 99% ac-
curacy (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994), it is signifi-
cantly more difficult when distinguishing closely-
related languages or short texts (Vatanen et al,
2010; da Silva and Lopes, 2006). The only lan-
guage classification work for distinguishing be-
tween these closely-related Arabic dialects that
we are aware of was performed by Zaidan and
Callison-Burch (2013). They collected web com-
mentary data written in MSA, Egyptian, Levan-
tine, and Gulf and performed dialect identifica-
tion experiments, their strongest classifier achiev-

ing 81.0% accuracy.
3.1 Training Data
Since Zaidan and Callison-Burch?s dataset in-
cludes no Darija, we collected Darija exam-
ples from the following sources to augment their
dataset: Moroccan jokes from noktazwina.
com, web pages collected using Darija-specific
query terms with a popular search engine, and
37,538 Arabic script commentary entries from
hespress.com (a Moroccan news website).
Nearly all the joke (N=399) and query term
(N=874) data contained Darija. By contrast, the
commentary data was mostly MSA. To extract
a subset of the commentary entries most likely
to contain Darija, we applied an iterative, semi-
supervised approach similar to that described by
Tratz and Sanfilippo (2007), in which the joke and
query term data were treated as initial seeds and,
in each iteration, a small portion of commentary
data with the highest Darija scores were added to
the training set. After having run this process to
its completion, we examined 131 examples at in-
tervals of 45 from the resulting ranked list of com-
mentary. The 62nd example was the first of these
to have been incorrectly classified as containing
Darija. We thus elected to assume all examples up
to the 61st of the 131 contain Darija, for a total of
2,745 examples (61*45=2,745). As an additional
check, we examined two more commentary entries
from each of the 61 blocks, finding that 118 of 122
contain Darija.
3.2 Initial Classifier
The integrated dialect classifier is a Maximum En-
tropy model (Berger et al, 1996) that we train us-
ing the LIBLINEAR (Fan et al, 2008) toolkit.
In preprocessing, Arabic diacritics are removed,
all non-alphabetic and non-Arabic script charac-
ters are converted to whitespace, and sequences of
any repeating character are collapsed to a single
character. The following set of feature templates
are applied to each of the resulting whitespace-
separated tokens:
? The full token
? ?Shape? of the token?all consonants are replaced by
the letter C, alefs by A, and waws and yehs by W
? First character plus the last character (if length ? 2)
? Character unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
? The last character of the token plus the first character
of the next token
? Prefixes of length 1, 2, and 3
? Indicators that token starts with mA and
? ends with $
? the next token ends with $
? is length 5 or greater
3.3 LDA Model
As an exploratory effort, we investigated using La-
tent Direchlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003)
as a method of language identification. Unfor-
tunately, using the aforementioned feature tem-
plates, LDA produced topics that corresponded
poorly with the training data labels. But, after
several iterations of feature engineering, the topics
began to reflect the dialect distinctions. Our final
LDA model feature templates are listed below.
? The full token
? Indicators that the token contains
? theh; thal; zah; theh, thal, or zah
? Indicators the token is of length 5+ and starts with
? hah plus yeh, teh, noon, or alef
? seen plus yeh, teh, noon, or alef
? beh plus yeh, teh, noon, or alef
? ghain plus yeh, teh, or noon
? or kaf plus yeh, teh, or noon
? Indicators that token starts with mA and
? ends with $
? the next token ends with $
? is length 5 or greater
The following features produced using the LDA
model for each document are given to the Maxi-
mum Entropy classifier: 1) indicator of the most-
likely cluster, 2) product of scores for each pair of
clusters.
3.4 Classifier Evaluation
We evaluated the versions of the classifier by ap-
plying them to the annotated data discussed in
137
Section 2.1. The initial classifier without the
LDA-derived features achieved 96.9% precision
and 24.1% recall. The version with LDA-derived
features achieved 97.2% precision and 44.1% re-
call, a substantial improvement. Upon review, we
concluded that most cases where the classifier ?in-
correctly? selected the Darija label were due to er-
rors in the gold standard.
4 Analysis of Annotated Conversations
Visualization of Darija in Conversations
The DATOOL may recover the conversation in
which a tweet occurs, providing the annotator with
the tweet?s full, potentially-multilingual context.
To visualize the distribution of Darija1 by script
in ?1K tweets from each user?s conversations, the
DATOOL transforms and exports annotated data
into a GEXF information network (cf. Figure 3),
which can be displayed in GEPHI.2 Currently,
GEPHI displays at most one edge between any two
nodes?GEPHI automatically augments the edge?s
weight for each additional copy of the edge.
The Darija in this user?s conversations, unlike
our two other users, is predominantly Romanized.
With more data, we plan to assess the impact of
one user?s script and language choice on others.

Code-Switching
The alternation of Darija with non-Darija in the

guages other than Darija received no markup.
2GEPHI?s Force Atlas layout automatically positions sub-
graphs by size, with larger ones further away from the center.
information network (red and green nodes vs.
blue nodes) within conversations is consistent with
well-known code-switching among Arabic speak-
ers, extending spoken discourse into informal
writing (Bentahila and Davies, 1983; Redouane,
2005). Code-switching also appears within our
tweet corpus where Romanized Darija frequently
alternates with French. Given the prevalence of
code-switching within tweets, future work will en-
tail training a Roman-script classifier at the to-
ken level.3 Since our DATOOL already supports
token-level as well as multi-token, tweet-internal
annotation in the mid-screen Message box, our
current corpus provides a seed set for this effort.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
The DATOOL now supports semi-automated an-
notation of tweet conversations for Darija. As
we scale the process of building low-resource lan-
guage corpora, we will document its impact on an-
notation time when few native speakers are avail-
able, a condition also relevant and critical to pre-
serving endangered languages. We have begun ex-
tending the classifier to support additional Arabic
script languages (e.g., Farsi, Urdu), leveraging re-
sources from others (Bergsma et al, 2012).
Many other open questions remain regarding
the annotation process, the visualizations, and the
human expert. Which classified examples should
the language expert review? When should an an-
notator adjust the confidence threshold in the DA-
TOOL? For deeper linguistic analysis and code-
switching prediction, would seeing participants
and tweets, turn by turn, in network diagrams such
as Figure 4 help experts understand new patterns
emerging in tweet conversations?

3As described in Section 3, our current classifier works at
the tweet level and only on Arabic-script tweets.
