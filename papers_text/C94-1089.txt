1 INTRODUCTION. 
IDItS (Intelligent Dictionary l ielp System) is 
conceived as a monolingual (explanatory) dictionary 
system for hum,'m use (Artola & Evrard, 92). The fact 
that it is intended for people instead of automatic 
processing distiuguishes it from other systems dealing 
with semantic knowledge acquisition from 
conventional dictiouaries, ql~e system provides various 
access possibilities to the data, allowing to deduce 
implicit knowledge from the explicit dictionary 
information. IDIIS deals with reasoning mechanisms 
analogous to those used by humans when they consult 
a dictionary. User level functionality of the system has 
been defined ,'rod is partially hnplementcd. 
q'he starting point of IDIIS is a Dictionary Database 
(DDB) built from an ordinary French dictionary. 
Meaning definitions have been analysed using 
linguistic information from the DDB itself and 
interpreted to be structured ,as a Dictionary Knowledge 
Base (DKB). As a result of the parsing, different 
lexical-semantic relations between word senses are 
established by means of semantic rules (attached to the 
patterns); this rules are used for the initial construction 
of the DKB. 
This paper describes tile knowledge rcprcsentatiou 
model adopted in IDIIS to represent he lexical 
knowledge acquired from the source dictionary. Once 
the acquisition process has been performed and the 
I)KB built, some enrichment processes have becn 
executed on the I)KB in order to enhance its 
knowledge about the words in the language. Besides, 
the dynamic exploitatiou of this knowledge is made 
possible by means of specially conceived eduction 
mechanisms. Both the enrichment processes and the 
dynamic deduction mechanisms are based on the 
exploitation of the properties of the lexical semantic 
relations represented in the DKB. 
In the following section an overview of II)IIS is 
given. Section 3 briefly presents the process of 
construction of the DKB. The knowledge 
representation model and the enrichmeut mechanisms 
are fully described in sections 4 and 5. Section 6 
describes some inferential aspects of the system. 
Finally, in section 7, some figures about he size of tile 
prototype built are presented. 
2 TIIE IDIIS DICTIONARY SYSTEM. 
IDIIS is a dictionary help system iuteuded to assist a 
human user in hulguage comprehension r production 
tasks. The system provides a set of functions that have 
been inspired by the different reasoning processes a
human user performs when consulting a conventional 
dictionary, such as definition queries, search of 
alternative definitions, differences, relations and 
analogies between concepts, thesaurus-like word 
search, verification of concept properties and 
interconceptual re ationships, etc. (Arregi et at., 91). 
II)IIS can bc seen as a repository of dictionary 
knowledge apt to be accessed and exploited in several 
ways. The system has been implemented on a 
symbolic architecture machiue using KEE knowledge 
engineering environment. 
Two plmscs are distinguished in the construction of 
tile DKB. Firstly, information containcd in the DDB is 
used to produce an initi,-d DKB. General information 
about the cntries obtained from the DDB (POS, usage, 
examples, etc.) is conventionally represented 
--attribute-value pairs in thc frame structure-- while 
the semantic omponent of the dictionary, i.e. the 
definition scntenees, has been analysed and 
represented as an interrelated set of concepts. In this 
stage the relations established between concepts could 
still be, in some cases, of lexical-syntactic nature. In a 
sccond phase, the semantic knowledge acquisition 
process is complcted using for that the relations 
established in the initial DKB. The purpose of this 
phase is to perform lcxical and syntactical 
disambiguation, showing that semantic knowledge 
about hierarchical relations between concepts c,'ul be 
determinant for this. 
3 BUILDING TIlE DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE 
BASE. 
'File starting point of this system is a small 
monoliugual French dictionary (Le Plus Petit 
Larousse, Paris: Librairie Larousse, 1980) consisting 
of nearly 23,000 senses related to almost 16,000 
entries. The dictionary was recorded in a relational 
database: the Dictionary Database (DDB). This DDB 
is the basis of every empirical study that has been 
developed in order to design the final model proposed 
for representation a d intelligent exploitation of the 
dictionary. 
The definition sentences have been analysed in the 
process of transformation f tbe data contained in the 
DDB to produce the DKB. The analysis mechanism 
used is based on hierarchies of phrasal patterns 
(Alshawi, 89). The semantic structure associated to 
each analysis pattern is expressed by means of a 
Semantic Structure Construction Rule (SSCR). The 
544 
prncess oF construction of the I)KB is automatic and 
based on these SSCR's (Artola, 93). 
The intcrconcelmml lexical-semantic relations 
delcclcd li'om Ihe analysis of the source dictionary are 
classified into paradigmatic and synlagmatic...Mnong 
the paradigmatic rclalions, the followiug have bccn 
found: sylu)uy~ny au(l antonymy, laxonomic relalions 
as hyperuymy/hyponymy --obtained from definitions 
of type "gcnt,s et differenlia"--, aud taxonymy itself 
(expressed by nlcaus of specific relators uch as sorte 
de aad espbce de), mcronymy, and others as gradation 
(for adjectives and verbs), equiwdcnce (between 
adjectives and past pmticiplc), factitive and rcllexivc 
(for verbs), lack and reference (to the previous ense). 
Whereas among the synlagmalic relations, i.e. those 
thai relate concepls belonging to different POS's, 
derivation is the most important, I)ut also relationships 
bctweell concepts without auy morphological relation 
its case relations, attributivc (for verbs), lack and 
couforlllily have Ix3eil dclccle(l, 
The hierarchies created have already been used to 
parse all Ihe noun, verb, and adjective definitions in 
the \])l)B. The hierarchy devoted to aualyze noun 
tit',f tuitions is formed with 65 l)attcrns, 49 differcut 
patlerns have been dcfiued lo analyze verb delinilion,% 
aud 45 for a(\[jectives. Although it is a partial parsing 
procedure, 57.76% of noun dcfinitious, 79.8% o1 verbs 
and 69.04% of those corresponding toa(!jeclivcs have 
been Iotally "caught" it, Ihis al)plication, l lowcver, 
wilh this technique of partial parsing, the parse is 
considered successful when all initial phrase slructure 
is recognized, which iu general contains Ihe gCllUS or

4 Ili,~PRI,;SI,;NTATI\[ON OF TI lE I) ICTIONARY 
KN(IWLI,;I)(;E: T I lE  I)KB. 
As we have just seen, the knowledge reprcscntadou 
scheme chosen for the I)KB of IDIIS is composcd of 
three clemenls, each of thetn structured as a dilTerent 
knowledge base: 
KI3-TIII~SAURUS is the reprcsentatio,l el  the 
diclionary as a semautic network of frames, where 
each li'alne rcprcsenls a Olle-word collcepl (word 
seuse) or a phrasal concept. Phrasal concepts 
rcpresent phrase structures associated to the 
occurrence of concepts in meaning definilions. 
Frames ..... or trails--- are interrelated by slots 
rcpreseutiug lexical-semanlic rclati(ms such as 
synonymy, taxonomic relations (hypcrnymy, 
hyponymy, and taxonymy ilselD, mertmymic 
relations (parl-of, cl('menl-of, sctoof, member-oD,

* KB-STRUCTURES contains recta-knowledge 
about concepts and relalions in KB-DICTIONARY 
aud KB-'IIIESAURUS: all the different structures 
in tim DKB arc defined here specifying the 
corresponding slots aud describing the slots by 
means of facets Ihat specify their value ranges, 
inherilaucc modes, etc. Units in KB-TIIESAURUS 
aud KB-I)ICTIONARY m'e subclasses or instances 
of classes defined in KB-STRUCI'URES. 
Fig. 1 gives a parlial view of tim three knowlcdge 
bases which form the DKB with their correspondent 
units and Ihcir inter/inlra relationships. 
In tim KB-TIIESAURUS, some of the links 
representing lexicat-semmltic relations are created 
when buildiug Ihe initial version of the knowledge 
base, while others are deduced later by means of 
specially conceived eduction mechauisms. 
When a dictionary entry like spatule I I: aerie de 
cuiller plate (a kind of flat Sl)Oon) is treated, new 
concept unils arc created in KB-TIII';SAURUS (aud 
subsidiarily iu KB-DICTIONAR.Y) and linked to 
olhers previously included in il. l)uc to the ellct:l of 
these links new wflucs lot some l)roperlies arc

iuheritance role of each attribnte). Fig. 1 lose shows 
the types of couecpts used: spatule 1 1 and cuiller l I 
are uoun definitions and considered subclasses of 
ENTITII'~S while plat I 1 (an adjective) is a sulx:lass of 
QUALITIF.S. The phrasal concept unit representing 
the noun phrase cuiller plate is treated as a l,yponym 
of its nuclcar conccpt (cuil&r 1 1). 
4.1 KII-STi{UCTURES: the recta-knowledge. 
This knowledge base reflects the hierarchical 
orgauisation of tile knowledge included in the I)KB. 
We will focus on the LKB-STRUCTURES class 
which defines the data types used in KB- 
DICTIONARY and KB-TIIESAURUS, and that 
organises the units belonging to these knowledge bases 
inlo a taxonomy. 
Slots defined in KB-STRUCTURI';S have 
associatcd aspects such as the value class, the 
inheritance role detcrmiuing how values in children's 
slots me calcttlated, and so ou. Each lcxical-scmantic 
relation --xeprcs(-ntcd by an attribute or slot--  has its 
own inheritance role. For instance, the inheritance role 
of the CARACTI~.RISTIQIJL: relation slates that every 
concept inherits the union of the valucs of the 
hypenlyms lot tltat relation, whilc the role dclincd fi)r 
Ihc SYNONYMES relation inhibits value inheritance 
from a concept o ils hylxmyms. 
The subclasses defined under LKB-STI(UCTURFS 
are the following: 
o ENTRII~,S, that groups dictionary entries belonging 
to KB-DIC~I'IONARY; 
I)ElqNITIONS, that groups word senses classified 
according to their lOS; 
o REFI~;RI~:;NCI~;S, concepts created in KB- 
TI IESAURUS due to their occuncnce in definitions 
of other concepts ("definitionlcss"); 
? CONCEVFS, that groups, under a conceptual point 
of view, word senses aud other conceptual utfits of 
KB-TIIESAURUS. 
The classification of conceptual units under this last 
class is as follows: 
? TYPE-CONCEPTS correspond to Quillian's 
(1968) "type nodes"; this class is, in fact, like a 
supcrclass under which every concept of KB- 
TIII2SAURUS is placed. It is fi~rthcr subdivided in 
the classes ENTITII'?.S, ACTIONS/F.VF.NTS, 
Q\[JALITIES and STAq'ES, that classify different 
types of concepts. 
? P I IRASAL-CONCEPTS is a class that includes 
concepts s imi lar  to Qui l l iau's "tokens" 
.--occurrences of type concepts in the delinitio,i 
scnlcnccs--. Phrasal concepts ,'u'e the representation 
of phrase stn~ctures which are composed by several 
concepts with semantic ontent. A phrasal couccpt 
is always built as a subclass of the class which 
,cpresents its head (the nouu of a noun phrase, the 
verb of a verb phrase, and so on), and integrated in 
the conceptual taxonomy. Phrasal concepts are 
c lassi f ied into NOMINALS,  VERBALS,  
A1)JFL;TIVALS, ~md AI)VERBIALS. 
For iustance,' Iplaute I 1#31 is a phrasal concept (see 
Fig. 2), subclass of the type concept Iplaute I 11, and 
represents he noun phrase "une plante d'ornement". 
? Finally, the concepts that, after the analysis phase, 
are not yet completely disambiguated (lexical 
ambignity) ,  are placed under the class 
AMBIGUOUS-CONCEI rFS ,  which is further 
subdivided into the subclasses I IOMOGRAPIIE 
(e.g. Ifacult6 ? ?1), SENSE ( IpanserI  ?1), and 
COMPLEX (Idouner I 5/61), in order to distinguish 
them according to the level of ambiguity they 
present. 
The links between units iu KB-TIII\]SAURUS and 
KB-DICTIONARY are implemented by means of slots 
tagged with the n,'une of the link they represent. These 
slots are defined in the different classes of KB- 
STI~.UC~I'URI:S. 
The representation model used in the system is 
made up of two levels: 
? Definitory level, where the surface representation f 
the def in i t ion of each sense is made. 
Morphosyntactic features like verb mode, dine, 
determination, etc. arc represented by means of 
faeets attached to the attributes. The defiuitory level 
is implemented using representational ttributes. 
Examples of this kiud of attributes are: DEF- 
SORTI:D, 1) t'." F-QUI, CARACTERISTIQUE and 
AVEC. 
o Relational level, that rellccts the relational view of 
the lexicon. It supports the deductive behaviour of 
the system and is made up by means of relational 
attributes, that may eventu,'dly contain deduced 
knowledge. These attributes, defined in the class 
TYPE-CONCEPTS, are the implementation f the 
iuterconceptual relations: ANTONYMES, AGENT, 
CARACTI~.RISTIQUE, SORTI:.-I)E, CE-QUI, etc. 
4.2 KB-I)ICT1ONARY: from words to COliCepl,',;. 
This knowledge base represents he links between each 
dictionary entry and its senses (see link 4 in Fig. 1). 
4.3 KB-T I IESAURUS:  the concept network.  
KB-TIIESAUI~,US stores the concept network that is 
implemented asa network of frames. Each node ill the 
net is a fnune that rcpresent.s a conceptual unit: one- 
word concepts and phrasal concepts. 
The ~cs interconnect |lie concepts and represent 
lexical-semantic relations; they are implemented by 
means of frame slots containing pointers to other 
concepts. I Iypcruym and hyponym relations have been 
made explicit, making up a concept axotlonty. These 
taxonomic relations have bccn implemented using the 
environment hierarchical relationship, in order to get 
inheritance automatically. 
Let us show an example. The representatiou f the 
followiug dclinition 
gdranium I 1: une plante d'ornement 
546 
rcqltires the el'cation of two new conccplual units in 
TIII ';SAURUS: Illo OIkO which coircspotlds to Ihc 
dcfiuicndum and Ihc phrasal COlkCCpt which rcpresculs 
Ihc nOkltk phrase of  t im dclinition. Morcovcr, the IInils 
which rcprcsen! plante and ornement  are lo be created 
also (if they have not been previously crcatcd because 
their occuklence ill another definiiiou). 
l , c t  us suppose that three new trails arc created: 
Igdranium I 11, Iplamc 1 11131 mid lonmnmnt 111. 
Altdbutes ilk tile units may contain laccts (attribules 
for the allribtllcs) used in the dcfinitory level to record 
aspects like dctcrmination, genre and so on, but also to 
establish the relations bclwccn delinitory allrihules 
with their corresponding rclalitmal, el to specify the 
certainly that the value in a rcprcscntational thibutc 
has to be "promoted" It) a con csponding rclational (scc 
hclow like case of like slol I)F, in Iplanlc I 11131). 
Following is given Ihe COmlX)sition of tim liamcs of 
dmsc three unils at Ihc dcf in i lory level of

Before showing Ihe representation f these units at 
the rclalional evel, it has It) be said that after the inilkd 
I)KB has been built some deductive procedures have 
been cxccutcd: e.g. dcduclion of inverse relationships, 
taxonomy formation, etc. It is to say that in l;ig. 2, 
where the rehktional view is presented, Ihc relations 
deduced by Ihesc procedures arc also rcprcscntcd.

Frequently, phrased concel)tS represent "mllabcllcd" 
concepts, i.e., they iudeed represent concepts that do 
not have a significant in the language. For instance, 
there is not, at least in French, a verbal concept 
meaning 'ajuster des pi~ces de radial' nor a nouu 
meaning 'piece de radial'. I Iowevcr, tiffs is not the c~L~,c 
of tim phrasal concepts that are linked to type concepts 
by means of the relation I)EFINI-PAI~,/DEFINrrlON-I)F., 
because there, the phrasal concept is, in fact, another 
rcprcsemation f Ihc concept bcing defincd (see above 
tim example of the definition of gdranium I i). In the 
representation model proposcd in this work, phrasal 
concepts denote concepts that are typically cxpressed 
in a periphrastic way and that do not have necessmily 
any corresponding entry in the dictionary 1.
Another intcrcsting lmint related to the creation of 
thesc phrasal couccpts is the maintenance of direct 
links bclwc?,u a concept and ~dl tile occnrrences of tiffs 
concept in the definition sentences of other eonccpts. It
1 "nits coohl bc very interesting also, in tile opinion of tile authors, in a 
multilingual environment: it is l~ssible that, in auother language, tire concept

5 ENRIC I lMENT PROCFSSES PERFORMED 
ON THE DKB. 
In this section tim cnrichment processes accomplished 
on the DKB are explained. Two phases are 
dislinguished: (a) the enrichment obtained during the 
construction of the initial DKB, and (b), where 
different tasks concerning mainly tim exploitation of 
the properties of synonymy and taxonymy have been 
performed. 
5.1 Enrichment obtained during the construction of 
the initial I)KB. 
KB-TI IESAURUS itself, represented - -as  a 
network--- at the relational level, can be considered an 
enrichment of the definitory level becanse, while the 
DKB was built, tim following processes have been 
performed: 
. Values coming from file definiiory k;vel have been 
promotcd to the relational level. 
? Values coming from the nnit which represents the 
tiefiniens havt: been transferred to the 
corresponding definiendum unit. 
The maintcnancc of the relations in both directions 
has been antomalically guamntccd. 
? "Ille concepts included in REFERENCES have becn 
directly related to other concepts. 
The taxonomy of coneepls has bccn made explicit, 
thus obtaining wduc iuhcritanee. 
5.2 Second phase in tile enr ichment of the DKB, 
Several processes have tmeu carried out in order to 
infer new facts to be asserted in tile DKB 2. "lhe 
enrichment obtained in this phase concerns tim two 
follt)wing aspects: 
o Exploitation of the properties of the synonylny 
(symmetric and transitive). 
* Enlargement of the concept taxonomy based on 
synonymy. 
Another aspect that has been considered to be 
exploitexl in this phase is that of disambiguation, qhe 
use of the lexical-sentantic knowledge about 
hierarchical relations contained in the DKB can be 
detcnninant in order to reduce tim level of lexical and 
syntactical ambiguity 3. l leuristics based on the 
taxonomic and synonymic knowledge obtained 
previously have been considered in tiffs phase. Some 
of them have been designed, implemented and 
cwlluatcd in a sample of the DKB. 
2 By tnear~s of rules fired following a forward chaining strategy. 
3 Lexical ambiguity comes from tile definitions themselves; yntactical 
ambiguity is due lroinly to the anadysis process,

6 INFERENTIA l ,  ASPECTS:  DYNAMIC 
DEDUCTION OF KNOWLEI )GE.  
I)ynalnie acquisition of knowlcdgc deals with the 
knowledge not explicitly represented ill the 1)KB aqd 
captured by means of especial ly conceived 
mechanisms which ,arc aelivaled when thc system is to 
answer a question posed by the user (Arregi et al, 91). 
Thc lollowing ,aspect,,; 'u'e considered: 
? Inheritance (concept taxouomy). 
Composition o1 lexic~d relations. 
Links bctweeu concepts and relations: users are 
allowed to use actual concepts to denote 
relationships (and not only primitive rclatious). 
. Anlbiguity ill file DKB: trealnlent of reraaining 
imccrlainty. 
In the following, some aspects couccnliug to Ihe 
secoud point will be discusscd. 
lu IDIIS, Ihe relationships atnoug the diffcrenl 
lcxical-semautic relations can be easily expressed in a 
declarative way. It is tile way of expressing these 
,elationships that is cMled Ihc composition of lexical 
relations. From an operative poiat of view, this 
mechanism permits the dyuamic exploitation --under 
Ihc user's requests--- nf Ihe tnopcrties of Ihe lexical 
relations in a direct maturer. It is, in fact, a way of 
acquiring iml)licit knowledge Ii'om II,c DKB. 
The declarative aspect of the mcchanism is based 
on the definilion of triples: each llil)le expresses a
relationship among difli'.reut lcxical-scmanlic relations. 
These Iriples have thr, form (R l R 2 R3), where R i 
represcnls a lexical rehdiou 4. The opel alive eflgct of 
these declarations is Ihe dynalnic crealiou of 
Irausitivity rules based on the triples stated. The 
l, cueral fornl of these rules is file lbllowing: 
i fXR  lYandY I (  2ZthenXR 3Z 
Whea the value(s) of the attribute R3 are asked, a 
reading demon (attached to the attribute) creates the 
rule aqd tires the reasoning l)rocess with a backward- 
chaitling strategy. The deduced lhcts, if ;lily, will not 
be asserted in lint: I)KB, but in a telnpora\[y context. 
l"or instance, tile prol)lenl of Irausitivily in 
mcronymic relations (Cruse, 86; Winston et al, 87) 
can be easily expressed by slating the triple (PARTll';~ 
I)F, PARTIE-I)F PARTIE-I)\[!) but not slating, fur 
itlslat~ce, (I'AR'IIE-I)I'; MI~MBRIM)P; PARTII;iq)I';), lhlls 
cxprcssiug that the Irmlsilivity in tile secolld case is not 
true. Examples of uther triples that have been staled in

Explicit rules of lexical composition cau Ix~ ilsc(l 
when the general form of the triplcs is not valid. These 
rules are uscxl following the same re`asoning strategy. 
Following is givcn the rule dcrived tYom the last 
Iriple and one insl;mee of it. By means of this rule 
instance, the lact that tile purpose of a gdranium is the 
action of orner is deduced from the delinitions of 
gdranium and orttemettt: 
if X OBJFCrIF Y and ;;; the objective of X is Y (entity) 
Y CE-QUI Z ;,;; Y "est ce qui" Z (action) 
then X ouJt.:c-rll~Z ;;; the objective of X is Z (action)

7 T I lE  I 'ROTOTYPE OF  IDIIS: SIZE OF TI IE 
I)KIL 
Following some ligures are given in order to show 
the size of tim prototype obtained alter the initial 
conshuction of the DKB. This l)rotntype contains au 
imporlant subset of the source dictionm y. 
KIM)ICrIONNAIRI~ contains 2400 entries, each 
one rcprcsentiug one word. KB-TI IESAURUS 
comains 6130 conceptual units; 1738 units of these arc 
phrasal concepts, in this Kilt there arc 1255 mnbig~lous 
conccpls. Once the initial coastmction phase was 
finished, 19691 relatioual arcs -- intercouceptual 
rclalionships--- had been established. 
After Ihe enrichment llroccsses, the mnnbcr of 
relational links have been incremented up to 2180{) 
(10.7%). it has been estimated that, using the 
mechanism of lexical composition, the number 
intcrconceptual relations could reach an incremcnt of 
betwccn 5 and 10% 5. 
8 CONCLIISIONSo 
A frame-based kuowlcdge representation model has 
been described? This model has been m;ed in an 
Intelligent Dictionary llelll System to represent the 
lexical knowledge acquired automatically I'ronl a 
conventional dielionm-y. 
The characterisadon f the different iuterconcepm~d 
lcxical-semantic relations is tile basis lot the prolx~stxl 
model and it has becu established as a result of tim 
analysis process c,'micd out on dictionary delinitkms. 
SewaM emichmcnt pmta~sscs have bccn pcrlbnned 
on the DKB ~--after tile initiM consh'uction--- in order 
to add new l~lct,'; to it; these processes are bascxl on the
