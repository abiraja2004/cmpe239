Abstract 
We present our CoNLL-2010 Shared Task 
system in the paper. The system operates in 
three steps: sequence labeling, syntactic de-
pendency parsing, and classification. We have 
participated in the Shared Task 1. Our experi-
mental results measured by the in-domain and 
cross-domain F-scores on the biological do-
main are 81.11% and 67.99%, and on the 
Wikipedia domain 55.48% and 55.41%. 
1 Introduction 
The goals of the Shared Task (Farkas et al, 2010) 
are: (1) learning to detect sentences containing 
uncertainty and (2) learning to resolve the in-
sentence scope of hedge cues. We have partici-
pated in the in-domain and cross-domain chal-
lenges of Task 1. Specifically, the aim of Task 1 
is to identify sentences in texts that contain unre-
liable or uncertain information, and it is formu-
lated as a binary classification problem. 
Similar to Morante et al (2009), we use the 
BIO-cue labels for all tokens in a sentence to 
predict whether a token is the first one of a hedge 
cue (B-cue), inside a hedge cue (I-cue), or out-
side of a hedge cue (O-cue). Thus we formulate 
the problem at the token level, and our task is to 
label tokens in every sentence with BIO-cue. Fi-
nally, sentences that contain at least one B-cue or 
I-cue are considered as uncertain.  
Our system operates in three steps: sequence 
labeling, syntactic dependency parsing, and clas-
sification. Sequence labeling is a preprocessing 
step for splitting sentence into tokens and obtain-
ing features of tokens. Then a syntactic depend-
ency parser is applied to obtain the dependency 
information of tokens. Finally, we employ an 
ensemble classifier based on combining CRF 
(conditional random field) and MaxEnt (maxi-
mum entropy) classifiers to label each token with 
the BIO-cue. 
Our experiments are conducted on two train-
ing data sets: one is the abstracts and full articles 
from BioScope (biomedical domain) corpus 
(Vincze et al, 2008)1, the other one is paragraphs 
from Wikipedia possibly containing weasel in-
formation. Both training data sets have been an-
notated manually for hedge/weasel cues. The 
annotation of weasel/hedge cues is carried out at 
the phrase level. Sentences containing at least 
one hedge/weasel cue are considered as uncertain, 
while sentences with no hedge/weasel cues are 
considered as factual. The results show that em-
ploying the ensemble classifier outperforms the 
single classifier system on the Wikipedia data set, 
and using the syntactic dependency information 
in the feature set outperform the system without 
syntactic dependency information on the biologi-
cal data set (in-domain). 
In related work, Szarvas (2008) extended the 
methodology of Medlock and Briscoe (2007), 
and presented a hedge detection method in bio-
medical texts with a weakly supervised selection 
of keywords. Ganter and Strube (2009) proposed 
an approach for automatic detection of sentences 
containing linguistic hedges using Wikipedia 
weasel tags and syntactic patterns. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 presents the technical details 
of our system. Section 3 presents experimental 
results and performance analysis. Section 4 pre-
sents our discussion of the experiments. Section 
5 concludes the paper and proposes future work. 
2 System Description 
This section describes the implementation of our 
system. 
2.1 Information Flow of Our System 
Common classification systems consist of two 
steps: feature set construction and classification. 
The feature set construction process of our sys-

tem consists of sequence labeling and syntactic 
dependency parsing. Figure 1 shows the main 
information flow of our system.

tem 
2.2 Sequence labeling 
The sequence labeling step consists of the fol-
lowing consecutive stages: (1) tokenizing, (2) 
chunking, (3) POS-tagging, (4) lemmatizing. 
Firstly, the PTBTokenizer2 is employed to split 
sentence into tokens. Then, tokens are labeled 
with BIO-tags by the OpenNLP 3  chunker. Fi-
nally, Stanford Parser4 is used to obtain the POS 
and lemma of tokens. 
2.3 Syntactic Dependency Parsing 
In the syntactic dependency parsing stage, we 
use the Stanford Parser again to obtain depend-
ency information of tokens. Based on the Stan-
ford typed dependencies manual (Marneffe and 
Manning 2008), we have decided to obtain the 
tree dependencies structure. During the process 
of parsing, we found that the parser may fail due

to either empty sentences or very long sentences. 
To deal with very long sentences, we decided to 
allocate more memory. To deal with empty sen-
tences, we decided to simply label them as cer-
tain ones because there are only a few empty 
sentences in the training and test data sets and we 
could ignore their influence. 
2.4 Features 
After sequence labeling and syntactic depend-
ency parsing, we obtain candidate features. In 
our system, all the features belong to the follow-
ing five categories: (1) token features, (2) de-
pendency features, (3) neighbor features, (4) data 
features, (5) bigram and trigram features. 
Token features of the current token are listed 
below: 
? token: the current token. 
? index: index of the current token in the sen-
tence 
? pos: POS of the current token. 
? lemma: lemma of the current token. 
? chunk: BIO-chunk tags of the current token. 
Dependency features of the current token are 
listed below: 
? parent_index: the index of the parent token 
of the current token. 
? parent_token: the parent token of the current 
token. 
? parent_lemma: the lemma of the parent token 
of the current token. 
? parent_pos: the POS of the parent token of 
the current token. 
? parent_relation: the dependency relation of 
the current token and its parent token. 
Neighbor features of the current token include 
token, lemma, pos, chunk tag of three tokens to 
the right and three to the left. 
Data features of current token are listed below: 
? type: indicating documentPart 5  type of the 
sentence which contains the current token, 
such as Text, SectionTitle and so on.  
? domain: distinguishing the Wikipedia and 
biological domain. 
? abstract_article: indicating document type of 
the sentence which contains the current token, 
abstract or article.

We empirically selected some bigram features 
and trigram features as listed below: 
? left_token_2+left_token_1 
? left_token_1+token 
? token+right_token_1 
? right_token_1+right_token_2 
? left_token_2+left_token_1+token 
? left_token_1+token+right_token_1 
? token+right_token_1+right_token_2 
These are the complete set of features for our 
system. If the value of a feature is empty, we set 
it to a default value. In the ensemble classifier, 
we have selected different features for each indi-
vidual classifier. Details of this are described in 
the next subsection. 
2.5 Classification 
In our system, we have combined CRF++6 and 
OpenNLP MaxEnt7 classifiers into an ensemble 
classifier. The set of features for each classifier 
are shown in the column named ?system? of Ta-
ble 6. And the two classifiers are used in training 
and prediction separately, based on their individ-
ual set of features. Then we merge the results in 
this way: for each token, if the two predictions 
for it are both O-cue, then we label the token 
with an O-cue; otherwise, we label the token 
with a B-cue (one of the predictions is B-cue) or 
an I-cue (no B-cue in the predictions). The moti-
vation of the ensemble classifier approach is 
based on the observation of our internal experi-
ments using 10-fold cross validation, which we 
describe in Section 3. In addition, the parameters 
of OpenNLP MaxEnt classifier are all set to de-
fault values (number of iterations is 100, cutoff is 
0 and without smoothing). For CRF++, we only 
set the option ?-f? as 3 and the option ?-c? as 1.5, 
and the others are set to default values. 
3 Experimental Results 
We have participated in four subtasks, biological 
in-domain challenge (Bio-in-domain), biological 
cross-domain challenge (Bio-cross-domain), 
Wikipedia in-domain challenge (Wiki-in-
domain) and Wikipedia cross-domain challenge 
(Wiki-cross-domain). In all the experiments, TP, 
FP, FN and F-Score for the uncertainty class are 
used as the performance measures. We have

tested our system with the test data set and ob-
tained official results as shown in Table 1. In 
addition, we have performed several internal ex-
periments on the training data set and several 
experiments on the test data set, which we de-
scribe in the next two subsections. The feature 
sets used for each subtask in our system are 
shown in Table 6, where each column denotes a 
feature set named after the title of the column 
(?System?, ?dep?, ?).  Actually, for different 
subtasks, we make use of the same feature set 
named ?system?.

Table 1: Official results of our system. 
3.1 Internal Experiments 
Initially we only used a single classifier instead 
of an ensemble classifier. We performed 10-fold 
cross validation experiments on the training data 
set at the sentence level with different feature 
sets. The results of these experiments are shown 
in Table 2 and Table 3. 
In internal experiments, we mainly focus on 
the results of different models and different fea-
ture sets. In Table 2 and Table 3, CRF and ME 
(MaxEnt) indicate the two classifiers; ENSMB 
stands for the ensemble classifier obtained by 
combining CRF and MaxEnt classifiers; the three 
words ?dep?, ?neighbor? and ?together? indicate 
the feature sets for different experiments shown 
in Table 6, and ?together? is the union set of 
?dep? and ?neighbor?. 
The results of ME and CRF experiments (third 
column of Table 2 and Table 3) show that the 
individual classifier wrongly predicts many un-
certain sentences as certain ones. The number of 
such errors is much greater than the number of 
errors of predicting certain ones as uncertain. In 
other words, FN is greater than FP in our ex-
periments and the recall ratio is very low, espe-
cially for the Wikipedia data set.

Table 5: Results of additional experiment of Wikipedia test data set. 
 
Based on this analysis, we propose an ensem-
ble classifier approach to decrease FN in order to 
improve the recall ratio. The results of the en-
semble classifier show that: along with the de-
creasing of FN, FP and TP are both increasing. 
Although the recall ratio increases, the precision 
ratio decreases at the same time. Therefore, the 
ensemble classifier approach is a trade-off be-
tween precision and recall. For data sets with low 
recall ratio, such as Wikipedia, the ensemble 
classifier outperforms each single classifier in 
terms of F-score, just as the ME, CRF and 
ENSMB experiments show in Table 2 and Table 
3. 
In addition, we have performed simple feature 
selection in the internal experiments. The com-
parison of ?dep?, ?neighbor? and ?together? ex-
periments shown in Table 2 demonstrates that 
the dependency and neighbor features are both 
beneficial only for the biological in-domain ex-
periment. This may be because that sentences of 
the biological data are more regular than those of 
the Wikipedia data. 
3.2 Additional experiments on test data set 
We have also performed experiments on the test 
data set, and the results are shown in Table 4 and 
Table 5. With the same set of features of our sys-
154
tem as shown in Table 6, we have performed 
three experiments: System-ME (ME denotes 
MaxEnt classifier), System-CRF (CRF denotes 
CRF classifier) and System-ENSMB (ENSMB 
denotes ensemble classifier), where ?System? 
denotes the feature set in Table 6. The meanings 
of these words are similar to internal experiments. 
As Table 4 and Table 5 show, for the Wikipe-
dia test data set, the ensemble classifier outper-
forms each single classifier in terms of F-score 
by improving the recall ratio with a larger extent 
than the extent of the decreasing of the precision 
ratio. For the biological test data set, the ensem-
ble classifier outperforms System-ME but under-
performs System-CRF. This may be due to the 
relatively high values of the precision and recall 
ratios already obtained by each single classifier. 
4 Discussion 
The features in our experiments are selected em-
pirically, and the performance of our system 
could be improved with more elaborate feature 
selection. From the experimental results, we ob-
serve that there are still many uncertain sen-
tences predicted as certain ones. This indicates 
that the ability of learning uncertain information 
with the current classifiers and feature sets needs 
to be improved. We had the plan of exploring the 
ensemble classifier by combining CRF, MaxEnt 
and SVM (Support Vector Machine), but it was 
given up due to limited time. In addition, we 
were not able to complete experiments with 
MaxEnt classifier based on bigram and trigram 
features due to limited time. Actually only two 
labels I and O are needed for Task 1. We have 
not done the experiments with only I and O la-
bels, and we plan to do it in the future. 
According to our observation, the low F-score 
on the Wikipedia data set is due to many uncer-
tain phrases. By contrast, for the biological data 
set, the uncertain information consists of mostly 
single words rather than phrases. It is difficult for 
a classifier to learn uncertain information con-
sisting of 3 words or more. As we have observed, 
these uncertain phrases follow several patterns. 
A hybrid approach based on rule-based and sta-
tistical approaches to recognize them seems to be 
a promising. 
5 Conclusion and Future Work 
Our CoNLL-2010 Shared Task system operates 
in three steps: sequence labeling, syntactic de-
pendency parsing, and classification. The results 
show that employing the ensemble classifier out-
performs each single classifier for the Wikipedia 
data set, and using the syntactic dependency in-
formation in the feature set outperform the sys-
tem without syntactic dependency information 
for the biological data set (in-domain). Our final 
system achieves promising results. Due to lim-
ited time, we have only performed simple feature 
selection empirically. In the future, we plan to 
explore more elaborate feature selection and ex-
plore ensemble classifier by combining more 
classifiers.
