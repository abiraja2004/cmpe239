Motivation: where does summarization 
help?
 Single document summarization 
 Simulate the work of intelligence analyst
 Judge if a document is relevant to a topic of interest
?Summaries as short as 17% of the full text length speed up 
decision making twice, with no significant degradation in 
accuracy.?
?Query-focused summaries enable users to find more relevant 
documents more accurately, with less need to consult the full text 
of the document.?
[Mani et al, 2002]
8
Motivation: multi-document summarization 
helps in compiling and presenting
 Reduce search time, especially when the goal of the 
user is to find as much information as possible about a 
given topic
 Writing better reports, finding more relevant information, 
quicker
 Cluster similar articles and provide a multi-document 
summary of the similarities
 Single document summary of the information unique to 
an article
[Roussinov and Chen, 2001; Mana-Lopez et al, 2004; McKeown et al, 2005 ]

Benefits from speech summarization
 Voicemail
 Shorter time spent on listening (call centers)
 Meetings
 Easier to find main points
 Broadcast News
 Summary of story from mulitiple channels
 Lectures
 Useful for reviewing of course materials
[He et al, 2000; Tucker and Whittaker, 2008; Murray et al, 2009]

Frequency as document topic proxy
10 incarnations of an intuition
 Simple intuition, look only at the document(s)
 Words that repeatedly appear in the document are likely to 
be related to the topic of the document
 Sentences that repeatedly appear in different input 
documents represent themes in the input
 But what appears in other documents is also helpful 
in determining the topic
 Background corpus probabilities/weights for word 
16
What is an article about?
 Word probability/frequency
 Proposed by Luhn in 1958 [Luhn 1958]
 Frequent content words would be indicative of the 
topic of the article
 In multi-document summarization, words or 
facts repeated in the input are more likely to 
appear in human summaries [Nenkova et al, 2006]

Is this a reasonable approach: yes, people 
seem to be doing something similar
 Simple test
 Compute word probability table from the input
 Get a batch of summaries written by H(umans) and S(ystems)
 Compute the likelihood of the summaries given the word 
probability table 
 Results
 Human summaries have higher likelihood

Obvious shortcomings of the pure 
frequency approaches
 Does not take account of related words
 suspects -- trail
 Gadhafi ? Libya
 Does not take into account evidence from 
other documents
 Function words: prepositions, articles, etc.
 Domain words: ?cell? in cell biology articles
 Does not take into account many other 
aspects
22
Two easy fixes
 Lexical chains [Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999, Silber and McCoy, 
2002, Gurevych and Nahnsen, 2005]
 Exploits existing lexical resources (WordNet)
 TF*IDF weights [most summarizers]
 Incorporates evidence from a background corpus
12
23
Lexical chains and WordNet relations
 Lexical chains
 Word sense disambiguation is performed 
 Then topically related words represent a topic
 Synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms
 Importance is determined by frequency of the words in a 
topic rather than a single word
 One sentence per topic is selected 
 Concepts based on WordNet [Schiffman et al, 2002, Ye et al, 
2007]
 No word sense disambiguation is performed
 {war, campaign, warfare, effort, cause, operation}
 {concern, carrier, worry, fear, scare}
24
TF*IDF weights for words
Combining evidence for document topics from the 
input and from a background corpus
 Term Frequency (TF)
 Times a word occurs in the input 
 Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
 Number of documents (df) from a background 
corpus of N documents that contain the word

Topic words (topic signatures)
 Which words in the input are most descriptive?
 Instead of assigning probabilities or weights to all words, 
divide words into two classes: descriptive or not
 For iterative sentence selection approach, the binary 
distinction is key to the advantage over frequency and 
TF*IDF
 Systems based on topic words have proven to be the most 
successful in official summarization evaluations 
14
27
Example input and associated topic words
 Input for summarization: articles relevant to the 
following user need
Title: Human Toll of Tropical 
Storms Narrative: What has been the human toll in death or injury 
of tropical storms in recent years? Where and when have each of 
the storms caused human casualties? What are the approximate 
total number of casualties attributed to each of the storms?

Topic Words
28
Formalizing the problem of identifying topic 
words 
 Given
 t: a word that appears in the input
 T: cluster of articles on a given topic (input)
 NT: articles not on topic T (background corpus)
 Decide if t is a topic word or not
 Words that have (almost) the same probability in T 
and NT are not topic words
15
29
Computing probabilities
 View a text as a sequence of Bernoulli trails
 A word is either our term of interest t or not
 The likelihood of observing term t which occurs with 
probability p in a text consisting of N words is given by 
 Estimate the probability of t in three ways
 Input + background corpus combines
 Input only
 Background only
t
30
Testing which hypothesis is more 
likely: log-likelihood ratio test
has a known statistical distribution: chi-square 
At a given significance level, we can decide if a word is 
descriptive of the input or not.
This feature is used in the best performing systems for 
multi-document summarization of news [Lin and Hovy, 
2000; Conroy et al, 2006]

The background corpus takes more 
central stage
 Learn topics from the background corpus
 topic ~ themes often discusses in the background
 topic representation ~ word probability tables
 Usually one time training step
 To summarize an input 
 Select sentences from the input that correspond 
to the most prominent topics
17
33
Latent semantic analysis (LSA) [Gong and Liu, 
2001, Hachey et al, 2006, Steinberger et al, 2007]
 Discover topics from the background corpus with n unique 
words and d documents
 Represent the background corpus as nxd matrix A
 Rows correspond to words
 Aij=number of times word I appears in document j
 Use standard change of coordinate system and dimensionality 
reduction techniques
 In the new space each row corresponds to the most important 
topics in the corpus
 Select the best sentence to cover each topic
TUPVA =
34
Notes on LSA and other approaches
 The original article that introduced LSA for 
single document summarization of news did 
not find significant difference with TF*IDF
 For multi-document summarization of news 
LSA approaches have not outperformed topic 
words or extensions of frequency approaches
 Other topic/content models have been much 
more influential
18
35
Domain dependent content models
 Get sample documents from the domain
 background corpus
 Cluster sentences from these documents 
 Implicit topics
 Obtain a word probability table for each topic
 Counts only from the cluster representing the 
topic
 Select sentences from the input with highest 
probability for main topics 
36
Text structure can be learnt
 Human-written examples from a domain
Location, time
relief efforts
magnitude
damage
19
37
Topic = cluster of similar sentences from 
the background corpus
 Sentences cluster from earthquake articles
 Topic ?earthquake location?
 The Athens seismological institute said the temblor?s epicenter 
was located 380 kilometers (238 miles) south of the capital.
 Seismologists in Pakistan?s Northwest Frontier Province said the 
temblor?s epicenter was about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of 
the provincial capital Peshawar.
 The temblor was centered 60 kilometers (35 miles) north- west of 
the provincial capital of Kunming, about 2,200 kilometers (1,300
miles) southwest of Beijing, a bureau seismologist said.
38
Content model [Barzilay and Lee, 2004, Pascale et al, 2003] 
 Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based 
 States - clusters of related sentences ?topics?
 Transition prob. - sentence precedence in corpus
 Emission prob. - bigram language model

39
Learning the content model
 Many articles from the same domain
 Cluster sentences: each cluster represents a topic from 
the domain
 Word probability tables for each topic
 Transitions between clusters can be computed from 
sentence adjacencies in the original articles  
 Probabilities of going from one topic to another
 Iterate between clustering and transition probability 
estimation to obtain domain model
40
To select a summary
 Find main topics in the domain
 using a small collection of summary-input pairs
 Find the most likely topic for each sentence in 
the input 
 Select the best sentence per main topic
21
41
Historical note
 Some early approaches to multi-document 
summarization relied on clustering the 
sentences in the input alone [McKeown et al, 1999, 
Siddharthan et al, 2004]
 Clusters of similar sentences represent a theme in 
the input
 Clusters with more sentences are more important
 Select one sentence per important cluster
42
Example cluster
Choose one sentence to represent the cluster
1. PAL was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the 
region's currency crisis.
2. In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week 
pilots' strike.
3. Tan wants to retain the 200 pilots because they stood by 
him when the majority of PAL's pilots staged a 
devastating strike in June.
22
43
Bayesian content models
 Takes a batch of inputs for summarization
 Many word probability tables
 One for general English
 One for each of the inputs to be summarized
 One for each document in any input
To select a summary S with L words from 
document collection D given as input
The goal is to select the summary, not a 
sentence. Greedy selection vs. global will 
be discussed in detail later
S* = minS:words(S)?LKL(PD||PS)
44
KL divergence
 Distance between two probability distributions: P, Q
 P, Q: Input and summary word distributions  
KL (P || Q) = pP (w) log2 pP (w)pQ (w)w?
23
45
Intriguing side note
 In the full Bayesian topic models, word 
probabilities for all words is more important 
than binary distinctions of topic and non-topic 
word
 Haghighi and Vanderwende report that a 
system that chooses the summary with 
highest expected number of topic words 
performs as SumBasic
46

Advantages of the graph model
 Combines word frequency and sentence 
clustering
 Gives a formal model for computing 
importance: random walks
 Normalize weights of edges to sum to 1
 They now represent probabilities of transitioning 
from one node to another
52
Random walks for summarization
 Represent the input text as graph
 Start traversing from node to node 
 following the transition probabilities 
 occasionally hopping to a new node
 What is the probability that you are in any 
particular node after doing this process for a 
certain time? 
 Standard solution (stationary distribution)
 This probability is the weight of the sentence

Supervised methods 
 For extractive summarization, the task can be 
represented as binary classification
 A sentence is in the summary or not
 Use statistical classifiers to determine the score of a 
sentence: how likely it?s included in the summary
 Feature representation for each sentence
 Classification models trained from annotated data
 Select the sentences with highest scores (greedy for 
now, see other selection methods later)
28
55

 Sentence length
 long sentences tend to be more important
 Sentence weight
 cosine similarity with documents
 sum of term weights for all words in a sentence
 calculate term weight after applying LSA
56
Features
 Sentence position
 beginning is often more important
 some sections are more important (e.g., in

speaker dominant?)
 speech recognition confidence measure 
58
Classifiers
 Can classify each sentence individually, or 
use sequence modeling
 Maximum entropy [Osborne, 2002]
 Condition random fields (CRF) [Galley, 2006]
 Classic Bayesian Method [Kupiec et al, 1995]
 HMM [Conroy and O'Leary, 2001; Maskey, 2006 ]
 Bayesian networks 
 SVMs [Xie and Liu, 2010]
 Regression [Murray et al, 2005]
 Others
30
59
So that is it with supervised methods? 
 It seems it is a straightforward classification 
problem
 What are the issues with this method?
 How to get good quality labeled training data
 How to improve learning
 Some recent research has explored a few 
directions
 Discriminative training, regression, sampling, co-
training, active learning

Improving supervised methods: different 
training approaches
 What are the problems with standard training 
methods?
 Classifiers learn to determine a sentence?s label 
(in summary or not)   
 Sentence-level accuracy is different from 
summarization evaluation criterion (e.g., 
summary-level ROUGE scores)
 Training criterion is not optimal
 Sentences? labels used in training may be too 
strict (binary classes)
62
Improving supervised methods: MERT 
discriminative training
 Discriminative training based on MERT [Aker et 
al., 2010]
 In training, generate multiple summary candidates 
(using A* search algorithm)
 Adjust model parameters (feature weights) 
iteratively to optimize ROUGE scores
Note: MERT has been used for machine translation discriminative training
32
63
Improving supervised methods: ranking 
approaches 
 Ranking approaches [Lin et al 2010]
 Pair-wise training
 Not classify each sentence individually
 Input to learner is a pair of sentences
 Use Rank SVM to learn the order of two sentences
 Direct optimization
 Learns how to correctly order/rank summary candidates 
(a set of sentences)
 Use AdaRank [Xu and Li 2007] to combine weak rankers
64
Improving supervised methods: regression 
model
 Use regression model [Xie and Liu, 2010]
 In training, a sentence?s label is not +1 and -1
 Each one is labeled with numerical values to 
represent their importance
 Keep +1 for summary sentence
 For non-summary sentences (-1), use their similarity to 
the summary as labels
 Train a regression model to better discriminate 
sentence candidates
33
65
Improving supervised methods: sampling
 Problems -- in binary classification setup for 
summarization, the two classes are 
imbalanced
 Summary sentences are minority class. 
 Imbalanced data can hurt classifier training
 How can we address this?
 Sampling to make distribution more balanced to 
train classifiers
 Has been studied a lot in machine learning
66
Improving supervised methods: sampling
 Upsampling: increase minority samples
 Replicate existing minority samples
 Generate synthetic examples (e.g., by some kind 
of interpolation)
 Downsampling: reduce majority samples
 Often randomly select from existing majority 
samples
34
67
Improving supervised methods: sampling
 Sampling for summarization [Xie and Liu, 2010]
 Different from traditional upsampling and downsampling
 Upsampling
 select non-summary sentences that are like summary 
sentences based on cosine similarity or ROUGE scores
 change their label to positive 
 Downsampling: 
 select those that are different from summary sentences
 These also address some human annotation disagreement
 The instances whose labels are changed are often the ones 
that humans have problems with

Supervised methods: data issues
 Need labeled data for model training
 How do we get good quality training data? 
 Can ask human annotators to select extractive 
summary sentences
 However, human agreement is generally low
 What if data is not labeled at all? or it only 
has abstractive summary?
70
 Distributions of content units and words are similar
 Few units are expressed by everyone; many units 
are expressed by only one person
Do humans agree on summary sentence 
selection? Human agreement on word/sentence/fact selection
36
71
Supervised methods: semi-supervised 
learning
 Question ? can we use unlabeled data to 
help supervised methods? 
 A lot of research has been done on semi-
supervised learning for various tasks
 Co-training and active learning have been 
used in summarization
72
Co-training
 Use co-training to leverage unlabeled data
 Feature sets represent different views
 They are conditionally independent given the 
class label
 Each is sufficient for learning
 Select instances based on one view, to help the 
other classifier
37
73
Co-training in summarization
 In text summarization [Wong et al, 2008]
 Two classifiers (SVM, na?ve Bayes) are used on 
the same feature set
 In speech summarization [Xie et al, 2010]
 Two different views: acoustic and lexical features
 They use both sentence and document as 
selection units
74
Active learning in summarization
 Select samples for humans to label
 Typically hard samples, machines are not 
confident, informative ones
 Active learning in lecture summarization [Zhang 
et al 2009]
 Criterion: similarity scores between the extracted 
summary sentences and the sentences in the 
lecture slides are high
38
75
Supervised methods: using labeled 
abstractive summaries
 Question -- what if I only have abstractive 
summaries, but not extractive summaries? 
 No labeled sentences to use for classifier 
training in extractive summarization 
 Can use reference abstract summary to 
automatically create labels for sentences
 Use similarity of a sentence to the human written 
abstract (or ROUGE scores, other metrics)
76
Comment on supervised performance
 Easier to incorporate more information
 At the cost of requiring a large set of human 
annotated training data
 Human agreement is low, therefore labeled 
training data is noisy
 Need matched training/test conditions
 may not easily generalize to different domains
 Effective features vary for different domains
 e.g., position is important for news articles
39
77
Comments on supervised performance
 Seems supervised methods are more 
successful in speech summarization than in 
text
 Speech summarization is almost never multi-
document
 There are fewer indications about the topic of the 
input in speech domains
 Text analysis techniques used in speech 
summarization are relatively simpler

Summarization as an optimization problem
 Knapsack Optimization Problem 
Select boxes such that amount of money is 
maximized while keeping total weight under X Kg
 Summarization Problem 
Select sentences such that summary relevance is 
maximized while keeping total length under X words
 Many other similar optimization problems  
 General Idea: Maximize a function given a set of 
constraints

Greedy optimization algorithms
 Greedy solution is an approximate algorithm which 
may not be optimal
 Choose the most relevant + least redundant 
sentence if the total length does not exceed the 
summary length
 Maximal Marginal Relevance is one such greedy algorithm 
proposed by [Carbonell et al, 1998]
84
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) 
[Carbonell et al, 1998]
 Summary: relevant and non-redundant information
 Many summaries are built based on sentences ranked by 
relevance
 E.g. Extract most relevant 30% of sentences
Relevance Redundancyvs.
 Summary should maximize relevant information as 
well as reduce redundancy
43
85
Marginal relevance
 ?Marginal Relevance? or ?Relevant Novelty?
 Measure relevance and novelty separately
 Linearly combine these two measures
 High Marginal relevance if
 Sentence is relevant to story (significant information)
 Contains minimal similarity to previously selected sentences 
(new novel information)
 Maximize Marginal Relevance to get summary that 
has significant non-redundant information
86
Relevance with query or centroid
 We can compute relevance of text snippet 
with respect to query or centroid
 Centroid as defined in [Radev, 2004]
 based on the content words of  a document 
 TF*IDF vector of all documents in corpus
 Select words above a threshold : remaining vector 
is a centroid vector
44
87
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) 
[Carbonell et al, 1998]
 Q ? document centroid/user query
 D ? document collection
 R ? ranked listed
 S ? subset of documents in R already selected
 Sim ? similarity metric 
 Lambda =1 produces most significant ranked list
 Lambda = 0 produces most diverse ranked list
MMR? Argmax(Di?R?S)[?(Sim1(Di, Q))?(1??)max(Dj?S)Sim2(Di, Dj)]

45
89
MMR based summarization
 Why this iterative sentence selection process 
works?
 1st Term: Find relevant sentences similar to 
centroid of the document
 2nd Term: Find redundancy ? sentences that are 
similar to already selected sentences are not 
selected
90
 MMR is an iterative sentence selection 
process
 decision made for each sentence
 Is this selected sentence globally optimal?
Sentence selection in MMR
Sentence with same level of relevance but shorter may not be 
selected if a longer relevant sentence is already selected

 Greedy algorithm is an approximate solution
 Use exact solution algorithm with ILP (scaling issues 
though)
 ILP is constrained optimization problem
 Cost and constraints are linear in a set of integer variables
 Many solvers on the web
 Define the constraints based on relevance and 
redundancy for summarization
 Sentence based ILP
 N-gram based ILP

106
Submodular selection for summarization 
[Lin et al, 2009]
 Summarization Setup
 V ? set of all sentences in document
 S ? set of extraction sentences
 f(.) scores the quality of the summary
 Submodularity been used in solving many 
optimization problems in near polynomial time
 For summarization: 
Select subset S (sentences) representative of V 
given the constraint |S| =< K (budget)
54
107
Submodular selection [Lin et al, 2009]
 If V are nodes in a Graph G=(V,E) representing 
sentences
 And E represents edges (i,j) such that w(i,j) 
represents similarity between sentences i and j
 Introduce submodular set functions which measures 
?representative? S of entire set V

Example
Meeting transcripts and summary sentences (in red)
so it?s possible that we could do something like a 
summary node of some sort that
me003
but there is some technology you could try to applyme010
yeahme010
now I don?t know that any of these actually apply in 
this case

there?re ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of 
your bayes-net-edness

uh i- i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy-
or?s and noisy-maxes
me010
which is there are technical ways of doing itme010
uh let me just mention something that i don?t want 
to pursue today
me010
there there are a variety of ways of doing itme010
Broadcast news transcripts and summary (in red)
try to use electrical appliances before p.m. and after p.m. and 
turn off computers, copiers and lights when they're not being 
used
set your thermostat at 68 degrees when you're home, 55 
degrees when  you're away
energy officials are offering tips to conserve electricity, they say, 
to delay holiday lighting until after at night
the area shares power across many states
meanwhile, a cold snap in the pacific northwest is putting an 
added strain on power supplies
coupled with another unit, it can provide enough power for about
2 million people
it had been shut down for maintenance
a unit at diablo canyon nuclear plant is expected to resume 
production today
california's strained power grid is getting a boost today which 
might help increasingly taxed power supplies
114
Speech vs. text summarization: similarities
 When high quality transcripts are available
 Not much different from text summarization
 Many similar approaches have been used
 Some also incorporate acoustic information
 For genres like broadcast news, style is also 
similar to text domains
58
115
Speech vs. text summarization: differences
 Challenges in speech summarization
 Speech recognition errors can be very high
 Sentences are not as well formed as in most text 
domains: disfluencies, ungrammatical
 There are not clearly defined sentences
 Information density is also low (off-topic 
discussions, chit chat, etc.)
 Multiple participants

What should be extraction units in speech 
summarization?
 Text domain
 Typically use sentences (based on punctuation 
marks)
 Speech domain
 Sentence information is not available
 Sentences are not as clearly defined
Utterance from previous example:
there there are a variety of ways of doing it uh let me just mention something 
that i don?t want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it

Automatic sentence segmentation (side note) 
 For a word boundary, determine whether it?s a sentence 
boundary
 Different approaches: 
 Generative: HMM
 Discriminative: SVM, boosting, maxent, CRF
 Information used: word n-gram, part-of-speech, parsing 
information, acoustic info (pause, pitch, energy)
60
119
What is the effect of different 
units/segmentation on summarization?
 Research has used different units in speech 
summarization
 Human annotated sentences or dialog acts
 Automatic sentence segmentation
 Pause-based segments
 Adjacency pairs
 Intonational phrases 
 Words
120
What is the effect of different 
units/segmentation on summarization?
 Findings from previous studies
 Using intonational phrases (IP) is better than 
automatic sentence segmentation, pause-based 
segmentation [Maskey, 2008 ]
 IPs are generally smaller than sentences, also 
linguistically meaningful
 Using sentences is better than words, between 
filler segments [Furui et al, 2004]
 Using human annotated dialog acts is better than 
automatically generated ones [Liu and Xie, 2008]

Using acoustic information in 
summarization
 Acoustic/prosodic features: 
 F0 (max, min, mean, median, range)
 Energy (max, min, mean, median, range)
 Sentence duration
 Speaking rate (# of words or letters)
 Need proper normalization
 Widely used in supervised methods, in 
combination with textual features
62
123
Using acoustic information in 
summarization
 Are acoustic features useful when combining 
it with lexical information?
 Results vary depending on the tasks and 
domains 
 Often lexical features are ranked higher
 But acoustic features also contribute to overall 
system performance
 Some studies showed little impact when adding 
speech information to textual features [Penn and Zhu, 
2008]
124
Using acoustic information in 
summarization
 Can we use acoustic information only for speech 
summarization?
 Transcripts may not be available
 Another way to investigate contribution of acoustic 
information
 Studies showed using just acoustic information can 
achieve similar performance to using lexical 
information [Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Xie et al, 2009; Zhu et al, 
2009]
 Caveat: in some experiments, lexical information is used 
(e.g., define the summarization units)
63
125
Speech recognition errors
 ASR is not perfect, often high word error rate
 10-20% for read speech
 40% or even higher for conversational speech
 Recognition errors generally have negative 
impact on summarization performance
 Important topic indicative words are incorrectly 
recognized
 Can affect term weighting and sentence scores
126
Speech recognition errors
 Some studies evaluated effect of recognition 
errors on summarization by varying word 
error rate [Christensen et al, 2003; Penn and Zhu, 2008; Lin et al, 
2009]
 Degradation is not much when word error 
rate is not too low (similar to spoken 
document retrieval)
 Reason: better recognition accuracy in summary 
sentences than overall  
64
127
What can we do about ASR errors? 
 Deliver summary using original speech 
 Can avoid showing recognition errors in the 
delivered text summary
 But still need to correctly identify summary 
sentences/segments
 Use recognition confidence measure and 
multiple candidates to help better summarize
128
Address problems due to ASR errors
 Re-define summarization task: select 
sentences that are most informative, at the 
same time have high recognition accuracy
 Important words tend to have high recognition 
accuracy
 Use ASR confidence measure or n-gram 
language model scores in summarization
 Unsupervised methods [Zechner, 2002; Kikuchi et al, 2003; 
Maskey, 2008]
 Use as a feature in supervised methods
65
129
Address problems due to ASR errors
 Use multiple recognition candidates
 n-best lists [Liu et al, 2010]
 Lattices [Lin et al, 2010]
 Confusion network [Xie and Liu, 2010]
 Use in MMR framework
 Summarization segment/unit contains all the word 
candidates (or pruned ones based on probabilities)
 Term weights (TF, IDF) use candidate?s posteriors
 Improved performance over using 1-best recognition 
output

Disfluencies and summarization
 Disfluencies (filler words, repetitions, revisions, 
restart, etc) are frequent in conversational speech
 Example from meeting transcript:
so so does i- just remind me of what what you were going to do with the 
what what what what's
y- you just described what you've been doing
 Existence may hurt summarization systems, also 
affect human readability of the summaries
132
Disfluencies and summarization
 Natural thought: remove disfluenices 
 Word-based selection can avoid disfluent 
words 
 Using n-gram scores tends to select fluent 
parts [Hori and Furui, 2001]
 Remove disfluencies first, then perform 
summarization 
 Does it work? not consistent results 
 Small improvement [Maskey, 2008; Zechner, 2002]
 No improvement [Liu et al, 2007]
67
133
Disfluencies and summarization
 In supervised classification, information related to 
disfluencies can be used as features for 
summarization 
 Small improvement on Switchboard data [Zhu and Penn, 2006]
 Going beyond disfluency removal, can perform 
sentence compression in conversational speech to 
remove un-necessary words [Liu and Liu, 2010]
 Help improve sentence readability
 Output is more like abstractive summaries
 Compression helps summarization
134
Review on speech summarization
 Speech summarization has been performed 
for different domains
 A lot of text-based approaches have been 
adopted

investigated

We need help. Fires have spread in the nearby 
forest and threaten several villages in this remote 
area.
