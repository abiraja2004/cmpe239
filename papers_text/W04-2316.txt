researchers (e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997), are one
of several meta-dialogue behaviors that people use to
control the flow of conversation.
Meta-dialogue behaviors such as acknowledgment
are of interest because of their role in managing turn-tak-
ing: although acknowledgments may preface a new con-
tribution by the same speaker (Novick and Sutton,
1994), often they occur alone as a single-phrase turn that
appears to serve the purpose of explicitly declining an
opportunity to take a turn (Sacks et al, 1974). If
acknowledgment behavior is incorporated in spoken-lan-
guage systems, it may offer a more fluid and adaptable
means of managing turn-taking and pacing in human-
computer interaction.
Although some research systems incorporate
acknowledgments (e.g., Aist, 1998; Iwase and Ward,
1998; Okato et al, 1998), real-world spoken-language
interfaces generally don?t allow acknowledgments to
serve their turn-taking purpose. Turn-taking is com-
pletely controlled by one conversant, usually the system.
To reduce errors, designers of spoken-language systems
create prompts that guide the user toward short, focused,
in-vocabulary responses (e.g., Basson et al, 1996; Cole
et al, 1997). In many systems, the use of barge-in
defeats the common interpretation of an acknowledg-
ment: if the user speaks, the system quits speaking and
begins interpreting the user utterance. If the user
intended to signal that the system should continue, the
effect is exactly the opposite of the one intended. Thus,
current design practices both discourage and render
meaningless the standard uses of acknowledgments.

2 Experiment
The study design, described below, is identical to that
used in our baseline study (Ward et al, 2003) except that
the interface prompts and messages were delivered using
recorded human voices instead of synthesized voice.
These studies were conducted in both American English
and Mexican Spanish.

of an acknowledgment. In either
case, the system responds by presenting the next mes-
sage segment, and in fact it eventually presents the next
segment even if the subject says nothing at all. Thus, the
design allows the subject to choose freely between
accepting the system?s pace, or commanding the system
to continue, or acknowledging the presentations in a
fashion more typical of human conversation. In this way,
we hoped to understand how the subject preferred to
interact with the computer.
Subjects were told that the study?s purpose was to
assess the understandability and usability of the inter-
face, and that their task was to find the answers to a list
of questions. They were given no instructions in the use
of the program beyond the information that they were to
talk to it using normal, everyday speech.
We tested a total of 40 subjects, balanced for gender
and language. Subjects were solicited from the Univer-
sity of Texas at El Paso campus. They ranged in age
from 18 to 65, with most being between 20 and 25. Each
subject was paid $10.00 for participating in the study.
We used a Wizard of Oz protocol as a way to allow
the system to respond to acknowledgments and to pro-
vide robustness in handling repetitions. The wizard?s
interface was constructed using the Rapid Application
Developer in the Center for Spoken Language Under-
standing Toolkit (Sutton et al, 1998). A simple button
panel allowed the wizard to select the appropriate
response from the actions supported by the application.
The application functionality was limited to suggest real-
istic abilities for a current spoken-language interface.
The subject could request a message by message num-
ber, for example, but not by content or sender.
The interface prompts and messages were presented
using recorded human voices. The message texts were
presented in a male voice, and the control portions of the
interface were in a female voice. It was hoped that the
two voices would help the subjects determine the state of
the interface: delivering message text vs. controlling the
interface functions.
2.2 Measures
In comparing the strategies used to control the length of
the pauses (acknowledgment or command use or none),
the dependent variable was the number of times each
strategy was used to control the pacing of the interface.
The total number of turns varied between subjects
because some subjects listened to each message only
once while others went through messages multiple
times. We therefore normalized the counts by dividing
the number of times each strategy was used by the num-
ber of turns where the subject had had an choice of strat-
egies. We considered the possibility that subjects who
completed the task in only one pass though the messages

When interacting with the recorded-voice interface,
commands and acknowledgments were preferred as a
strategy by 15% and 17.5%, respectively, of all subjects.
This result was not significantly different than that seen
in the synthesized-voice study, as confirmed by the Wil-
coxen-Mann-Whitney test (z = -0.5041, p= 0.0139 for
commands, z = 1.686, p= 0.0465 for acknowledgments).
Contrary to our expectations, the numbers of sub-
jects using either acknowledgments and commands actu-
ally dropped. This was due to the fact that the numbers
of subjects who used waiting as their sole strategy rose
sharply, from 9 subjects in the synthesized-voice study
to 19 in the recorded-voice study ( , p<0.001).
Forty percent of the subjects used a command at
least once, and 45% used an acknowledgement at least
once. Seven subjects seemed comfortable with both
commands and acknowledgments, using at least five
examples of each. When acknowledgments were used,
the most common word choice was ?okay? (both lan-
guages). When commands were used, the most common
word choices were ?go on? in English, and ?continuar?
in Spanish.
We found no significant difference between the
recorded and synthesized-voice conditions when com-
paring male and female speakers nor when comparing
English and Spanish speakers.
Politeness behaviors were common. These included
the use of the phrases ?thank you? or ?gracias? and
?please? or ?por favor? as well as a responding ?good-
bye? or ?adi?s? to the system. Many subjects (7 Spanish-
language and 8 English-language, 37.5% total) used a
politeness behavior at least once and a few subjects (1
Spanish-language and 5 English-language, 15% total)
used them more than once. One English-speaking female
used politeness behaviors with almost half of her interac-
tions with the system. One subject, when asked in the
post-experiment interview why he chose to use this
behavior, responded ?I don?t know, it?s just habit I
guess.? Three other subjects made similar statements.
We believe, and some subjects confirmed, that some
subjects in the recorded version assumed that they were
listening to recordings similar to voice-mail messages on
their telephones. They believed that the pauses were part
of the message and so did not realize that the system was
awaiting their response.
4 Conclusions
We compared subjects? use of various strategies for con-
trolling the pacing of information presentation in a sim-
ple spoken-language interface using synthetic speech
with one using recorded speech. We had hypothesized
that subjects would offer more acknowledgments in the
recorded-voice condition. In fact, we saw no differences
