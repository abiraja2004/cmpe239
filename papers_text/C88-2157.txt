This paper proposes a new disambiguation method for 
Japanese text input. This method evaluates candidate sen- 
tences by measuring the number of Word Co-occurrence Pat- 
terns (WCP) included in the candidate sentences. An au- 
tomatic WCP extraction method is also developed. An ex- 
traction experiment using the example sentences from dic- 
tionaries confirms that WCP can be collected automaticMly 
with an accuracy of 98.7% using syntactic analysis and some 
heuristic rules to eliminate rroneous extraction. Using this 
method, about 305,000 sets of WCP are collected. A co- 
occurrence pattern matrix with semantic ategories is built 
based on these WCP. Using this matrix, the mean number of 
candidate sentences in Kana.-to-Kanji translation is reduced 
to about 1/10 of those fi-om existing morphological methods. 
1 . Introduct ion 
For keyboard input of Japanese, Kana-to-kanji translation 
method \[Kawada79\] \[Makino80\] \[Abe86\] is the most popu- 
lar technique. In this method, Kana input sentences are 
translated automatically into Kanji-Kana sentences. How- 
ever, non-segmentcd Kana input is highly ambiguous, be.. 
cause of the segmentation ambiguities of Kana input into 
morphemes, and homonym ambiguities. Some research as 
been carried out mainly to overcome homonym ambiguity 
using a word usage dictionary \[Makino80\] and by using case 
grammar \[Abe86\]. 
A new technique named collocational analysis method, is 
proposed to overcome both ambiguities. This evaluates the 
certainty of candidate sentences by measuring the number 
of co-occurrence patterns between word paix~. It is used 
in addition to the usual morphological nalysis. To realize 
this, it is essential to build a dictionary which can reflect 
Word Co-occurrence Patterns (WCP). In English processing 
research, there has been an attempt \[Grishman86\] to col- 
lect semi-automatically sublanguage selectional patterns. In 
Japanese processing research, there have been attempts \[Shi- 
rai86\] \[Tanaka86\] to collect combinations of words with this 
kind of relationship, eittmr completely- or semi-automatically. 
These two attempts did not provide a dictionary for practical 
use. 
A new method is proposed for building a dictionary which 
accumulates WCP. The first feature of this method is the col- 
lection of WCP from the common combination of two words 
having a dependency relationship in a sentence, because these 
common combinations will most likely reoccur in future texts. 
In this method, it is important o identify dependency re- 
lationships between word pai~s, instead of identifying, the 
whole dependency structure of the sentence. For this pur- 
pose, Dependency Localization Analysis (DLA) is used. This 
identifies the word pairs having a definite dependency rela- 
tionship using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules. 
This paper will first describe oUocational nalysis, a new 
concept in Kana-to-Kanji translation, then the compilation of 
WCP dictionary, next the translation Mgorithm and finMly 
translation experimental results. 
2. Concept  of  Co l loeat lona l  Ana lys i s  in Trans lat ion 
CollocationM analysis evaluates the correctness of a trans- 
lated sentence by measuring the WCP within the sentence. 
The WCP data is accmnulated in a 2-dimensional matrix, by 
information milts indicating more restricted concepts than 
the words can indica.te by themselves. 
As previously mentioned there are two kinds of ambigui- 
ties in Kana-to-Kanji translation. In Fig.i, disambiguation 
process of homonyms is illustrated. ' NA;R (a national 
anthem) and ~\[~'~-  (to play)'  and ' NAg( (a state) aud 
~.~-~- ;5 (to build)' etc. are examples of WCP. If the simple 
Kana sequence ' ~_ -~ h~ ~- .~./~ ~ 5 ~" ;5 \[kokkaoensousuru\]' is 
input, the usual translation system will develop two possible 
candidate words ' NJN ' (a national anthem) and ' NAg( (a 
state)', for the partial Kana sequence of ' ~ ~J h~ \[kokk@ 
The system will also develop uniquely the creed(date word, 
' ~-?  ;5 (to play) ' for '  R./~ <- -) -~- ;5 \[ensousumq'. These 
candidate words are obtained by table searching and mor- 
phologicM analysis. Itowever, morphological analysis alone 
can't identify which one is correct for ' ~. o h~ \[kokka\]. 
Using eo!loeationM analysis, ~he WCP of ' NA ~.7,~(a state)' and 
' ~ -  ;5 (to play)' is found to be nil, while that of '  NA~ (a 
national anthem)' and ' ~ ;5 (to play)' is found to be 
probable. Using WCP, ' NA ~ik ~ ~ ~ ~" -5 (to play a national 
anthem)' is selected as the final candidate sentence. If the 
Kana sequence' c o h~ ~ l:Y/b -t~ ~ ~" .5 \[kokkaokensetsusnru\]' 
is input, ' NA~-$k~:  ;5 (to build a state)' is obtained in 
same manner.

4. Trans lat ion A lgor l thm 
Fig.3 shows the translation process outline. First, table- 
searching is done for all segmentation possibilities to get each 
part-of-speech of segment. This' is carried out referring to 
independent word ?dictionary (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. 
\[65,000 words\]), prefix and suffix dictionary \[1085 words\], de- 
pendent word dictionary (postpositions, auxiliary verbs, etc. 
\[422 words D, Then, among the morpheme sequences con- 
structed with each segment, the grammatically possible se- 
quences are selected. 
Next, the candidate sentences with the least number of 
Bunsetsu are selected \[Yoshimura83\]. Furthermore, among 
tt~ese selected sentences, those which have the least number of 
words are selected. In this process, a heuristic rule is used to 
prevent morPheme sequence mis-selection. This rule rejects 
the combinations of nouns constructing a compound word, if 
the usage frequency of either nouns is very low. 
ex ,  
Input Kana sequence: 75~/b I;~ ~ 03 ~2 ~ \[kankeinonaka\] 
x ~ (noun) ~ (noun, freq. : very low) 
(a relation) (in a field) 
O ~ (noun) o) (postposition) OO (noun, freq. : high) 
(a relation) (among) 
Secondly, the co-occurrence pattern matrix is utilized in 
order to determine the number of WCP within each candi- 
date sentence. The counting operation is carried out only on 
adjacent Bunsetsu, because , in most eases, relationships are 
between adjacent Bunsetsu and determining extended rela- 
tionships would prove to be too time-consuming. 
Finally, the cand{date sentence with the maximum WCP 
number is chosen as the prime candidate. To prevent mis- 
taken deletion of prime candidates caused by word pairs which 
rarely co-occur, following rule is used. If the usage frequency 
of either word in WCP is low, the,candidate sentences of 
which WCP number is less one than maximum number, are 
also identified as prime candidates. In following example, 
both are identified as prime candidates.

Furthermore, translation accuracy of the praci;ica( tr~,~a.~',l;~.

It was confirmed that the translation accuracy evaluated by

6. Conclus ion 
A method for disambiguation based on colloeal;ional nal 
ysis of non-segmented Kana-to-Kanji translation has be(m de- 
veloped. To realize this, an automatic WCP dictionary coi c.- 
pilation method has also been developed. In an extractio~ 
experiment using example sentences fl'om dictionm'ie,q, it wm~ 
confirmed that WCP can be collected automatically wiflt a 
98.7% accuracy using syntactic anMysis and some heu.cistie 
rules to eliminate rrors. Using this method, about 305,000 
sets of WCP were collected. The co-occurrence patterrt m~ 
trix was built based on these WCP mid used in b'artslat.ion 
experiments. 
Experimental results show that tim mean umnber of can. 
didate sentences i reduced to about 1/10 of those fl:om exist- 
ing morphological methods and that a translatitm acem'~my ~i
