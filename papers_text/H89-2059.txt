The objective of this project is to develop a spoken language system capable of understanding and 
responding to spoken English commands and queries for interactive human-machine applications, uch as 
battle management, command and control, and training of personnel on complex tasks. The system will 
also include a capability to adapt o new speakers and a capability to detect when a user says a new word, 
and allows the user to add the word to the system. 
Work in this area requires the integration of three technologies: large-vocabulary continuous peech 
recognition, natural anguage understanding, and system integration. In our work at BBN, we have in- 
tegrated our BYBLOS continuous peech recognition technology with a new unification-based natural 
language understanding component, resulting in an initial complete spoken language system, called HARC 
(Hear And Respond to Continuous peech). 
Our most recent contribution is the development of a new strategy for integrating speech and natural 
language components, called "N-best". This method takes a spoken utterance and produces the N highest 
scoring sentences that match the input utterance withing some threshold, based on a statistical language 
model. The natural anguage component then searches these N sentences for the highest scoring sentence 
for which the system can produce a semantic interpretation. The meaning representations are passed to a 
discourse component that resolves reference ambiguities and chooses the best meaning. Finally, the chosen 
meaning representation is passed to a response component which carries out the user's request. 
Initial experiments have shown that for applications of interest, the correct sentence is usually one 
of the top five and almost always within the top twenty (i.e., N=20). One important feature of this N-best 
integration strategy is that it provides a very clean interface between speech and natural anguage and, 
therefore, allows for greater sharing of resources among researchers in spoken language systems. 
The natural language knowledge sources in HARC use a Unification formalism for describing 
the syntax and semantics of English and a higher-order intensional logic for representing the meaning 
of an utterance. The system uses unification to enforce syntactic as well as semantic onstraints, and 
provides for the incremental application of syntax and semantics. Advantages of this approach are that 
unproductive search paths are cut off more quickly, and any improvements in unification parsing (through 
better algorithms, special hardware, etc.) apply automatically to semantics as well as syntax. 
in this project, we have been very instrumental in the design and collection of spoken language 
data for the purpose of objective system evaluation. We previously helped specify the DARPA Resource 
Management Corpus that is now in common use for speech recognition evaluation, and we provided a 
Word-Pair Grammar to be used with the corpus. We have recently developed and made available to the 
DARPA community, with full documentation, a personnel database for use in spoken language valuations, 
and a relational database language (ERL) in Common LISP to interface to the database. We have also 
provided software to aid in the collection of an appropriate corpus by Texas Instruments. 
Most recently, we have started work on the automatic detection of out-of-vocabulary words. This 
is an important problem for any realistic system with a large vocabulary, since the user is unlikely to be 
able to remember which words are in the vocabulary. Imtial results for the detection of open-class wolds 
have been very encouraging.
