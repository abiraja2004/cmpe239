PROJECT GOALS 
WordNet is a lexical database for English organized in ac- 
cordance with current psycholinguistic heories. Lexicalized 
concepts are organized by semantic relations (synonymy, 
antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, etc.) for nouns, verbs, and 
adjectives. 
Work under this grant is intended to extend and upgrade 
WordNet, to make it generally available, and to develop it as 
a tool for use in practical applications. In order to make it 
available for information retrieval and machine translation, a 
system is being developed that accepts English text as input 
and automatically gives as output he same text augmented 
by syntactic and semantic notations that disambiguate all of 
the substantive words. Initially, the semantic tagging is being 
done manually so that we can (1) obtain extensive experience 
with the tagging process and (2) create adatabase of correctly 
tagged text for use in testing proposals for automatic sense 
disambiguation. 
RECENT RESULTS 
The work falls into four categories: (1) Preprocessing of 
textual corpora; (2) Development of ConText, an interface 
for semantically tagging text; (3) WordNet upgrade and; (4) 
Software development and distribution of WordNet. 
Textual Corpora. Acquisition of several large text corpora 
and development ofprograms to preprocess them. Currently 
the preprocessor formats the text one sentence per line, 
searches the text for all WordNet collocations, tokenizes the 
text accordingly, and subsequently runs the text through a 
part-of-speech tagger. The search for WordNet collocations 
handles inflectional morphology. 
ConText Interface. ConText is an X-windows interface to 
WordNet which takes the preprocessed text (described above) 
as input and accesses the WordNet entry for each content 
word (in the appropriate part of speech). The user selects 
the appropriate sense or, if that is not possible, indicates 
the nature of the problem encountered. ConText outputs 
the text with pointers to the selected WordNet senses (or, if 
no sense is chosen, the reason why). Current and previous 
sentences are displayed to give the user adequate context for 
disarnbiguation. The inflectional morphology component of 
WordNet is used by ConText so that the WordNet uninflected 
forms are found even though inflected forms are both input 
to and output from ConText. 
WordNet Upgrade. As of January, 1992 the number of 
different character strings in WordNet is 62,726; the number 
of lexicalized concepts (synsets) is 50,318; the number of 
unique string-sense combinations is 98,300; the total number 
of semantic pointers is 71,126; and the number of synsets 
containing definitional explanations i  20,718. In addition, 
the grammatical category of relational adjectives has been 
added to WordNet. These adjectives are defined by unidirec- 
tional pointers to the related noun, encoding the distinction 
between the adjective "nervous" in "nervous tudent" and the 
relational adjective in "nervous condition." 
Software Development. WordNet has been developed on 
Sun SPARCstations in the C language with an X-windows 
interface. MS-DOS and NeXT interfaces are also available. 
A Macintosh interface is currently being developed. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
The organization of WordNet provides an estimation of se- 
mantic distances between lexicalized concepts, and research 
will focus on how this feature can be exploited to facilitate 
lexical disambiguation. Once a large enough body of semanti- 
cally tagged text has been created using ConText, hypotheses 
can be tested. To facilitate retrieval of semantically related 
words from WordNet, it is likely that WordNet will be put 
into a relational database. 
WordNet will continue to be extended and upgraded. The 
direction of this work will be determined, in part, by the 
results of the semantic tagging.
