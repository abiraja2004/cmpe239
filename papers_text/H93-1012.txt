ABSTRACT 
The first Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-I) was 
held in early November 1992 and was attended by about 
100 people working in the 25 participating groups. The 
goal of the conference was to bring research groups 
together to discuss their work on a new large test collec- 
tion. There was a large variety of retrieval techniques 
reported on, including methods using automatic thesaurii, 
sophisticated term weighting, natural language tech- 
niques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern match- 
ing. As results had been run through a common evalua- 
tion package, groups were able to compare the 
effectiveness of different techniques, and discuss how 
differences among the systems affected performance. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
There is a long history of experimentation in infor- 
mation retrieval. Research started with experiments in 
indexing languages, uch as the Cranfield I tests \[1\], and 
has continued with over 30 years of experimentation 
with the retrieval engines themselves. The Cranfield II 
studies \[2\] showed that automatic indexing was compar- 
able to manual indexing, and this and the availability of 
computers created a major interest in the automatic 
indexing and searching of texts. The Cranfield experi- 
ments also emphasized the importance of creating test 
collections and using these for comparative valuation. 
The Cranfield collection, created in the late 1960's, con- 
tained 1400 documents and 225 queries, and has been 
heavily used by researchers since then. Subsequently 
other collections have been built, such as the CACM 
collection \[3\], and the NPL collection \[4\]. 
In the thirty or so years of experimentation there 
have been two missing elements. First, although some 
research groups have used the same collections, there 
has been no concerted effort by groups to work with the 
same data, use the same evaluation techniques, and gen- 
erally compare results across systems. The importance 
of this is not to show any system to be superior, but to 
allow comparison across a very wide variety of tech- 
niques, much wider than only one research group would 
tackle. Karen Sparck Jones in 1981 \[5\] commented that: 
Yet the most slriking feature of the test history 
of the past two decades is its lack of 
consolidation. It is true that some very broad 
generalizations have been endorsed by succes- 
sive tests: for example...but there has been a 
real failure at the detailed level to build one 
test on another. As a result there are no expla- 
nations for these generalizations, and hence no 
means of knowing whether improved systems 
could be designed (p. 245). 
This consolidation is more likely ff groups can compare 
results across the same data, using the same evaluation 
method, and then meet to discuss openly how methods 
differ. 
The second missing element, which has become criti- 
cal in the last ten years, is the lack of a realistically- 
sized test collection. Evaluation using the small collec- 
tions currently available may not reflect performance of 
systems in large full-text searching, and certainly does 
not demonstrate any proven abilities of these systems to 
operate in real-world information retrieval environments. 
This is a major barrier to the transfer of these laboratory 
systems into the commercial world. Additionally some 
techniques such as the use of phrases and the construc- 
tion of automatic thesaurii seem intuitively workable, but 
have repeatedly failed to show improvement in perfor- 
mance using the small collections. Larger collections 
might demonslrate he effectiveness of these procedures. 
The overall goal of the Text REtrieval Conference 
(TREC) is to address these two missing elements. It is 
hoped that by providing a very large test collection, and 
encouraging interaction with other groups in a friendly 
evaluation forum, a new thrust in information retrieval 
will occur. There is also an increased interest in this 
field within the DARPA community, and TREC is 
designed to be a showcase of the state-of-the-art in 
retrieval research. NIST's goal as co-sponsor of TREC 
is to encourage communication and technology transfer 
among academia, industry, and government. 
The following description was excerpted from a more 
lengthy overview published in the conference proceed- 
ings \[6\]. The full proceedings also contain papers by all 
participants and results for all systems.

2. THE TASK 
2.1 Introduction 
TREC is dcsigned to encouraage r search in information 
retrieval using large data collections. Two types of 
retrieval and being examined -- retrieval using an "ad- 
hoc" query such as a researcher might use in a library 
environment, and retrieval using a "routing" query such 
as a profile to filter some incoming document stream. It 
is assumed that potential users need the ability to do 
both high precision and high recall searches, and are wil- 
ling to look at many documents and repeatedly modify 
queries in order to get high recall. Obviously they 
would like a system that makes this as easy as possible, 
but this ease should be reflected in TREC as added intel- 
ligence in the system rather than as special interfaces. 
Since 'IREC has been designed to evaluate system per- 
formance both in a routing (filtering or profiling) mode, 
and in an ad-hoc mode, both functions need to be tested. 
The test design was based on traditional information 
retrieval models, and evaluation used traditional recall 
and precision measures. The following diagram of the 
test design shows the various components of TREC (Fig- 
ure 1).

Figure 1 -- The TREC Task 
This diagram reflects the four data sets (2 sets of topics 
and 2 sets of documents) that were provided to partici- 
pants. These data sets (along with a set of sample 
relevance judgments for the 50 training topics) were 
used to construct three sets of queries. Q1 is the set of 
queries (probably multiple sets) created to help in adjust- 
ing a system to this task, create better weighting algo- 
rithms, and in general to train the system fox testing. 
The results of this research were used to create Q2, the 
routing queries to be used against he test documents. 
Q3 is the set of queries created from the test topics as 
ad-hoc queries for searching against he combined ocu- 
ments (both training documents and test documents). 
The results from searches using Q2 and Q3 were the 
official test results. The queries could be constructed 
using one of three alternative methods. They could be 
constructed automatically from the topics, with no 
human intervention. Alternatively they could be con- 
structed manually from the topic, but with no "retries" 
after looking at the results. The third method allowed 
"retries", but under eonslrained conditions. 
2.2 The  Par t i c ipants  
There were 25 participating systems in TREC-1, using a 
wide range of retrieval techniques. The participants 
were able to choose from three levels of participation: 
Category A, full participation, Category B, full participa- 
tion using a reduced dataset (25 topics and 1/4 of the 
full document set), and Category C for evaluation only 
(to allow commercial systems to protect proprietary 
algorithms). The program committee selected only 
twenty category A and B groups to present alks because 
of limited conference time, and requested that the rest of 
the groups present posters. All groups were asked to 
submit papers for the proceedings. 
Each group was provided the data and asked to turn in 
either one or two sets of results for each topic. When 
two sets of results were sent, they could be made using 
different methods of creating queries (methods 1, 2, or 
3), or by using different parameter settings for one query 
creation method. Groups could chose to do the routing 
task, the adhoc task, or both, and were requested to sub- 
mit the top 200 documents retrieved for each topic for 
evaluation. 
3. THE TEST  COLLECT ION 
Critical to the success of TREC was the creation of the 
test collection. Like most traditional retrieval collec- 
tions, there are three distinct parts to this collection. 
The first is the documents themselves -- the training set 
(D1) and the test set (D2). Both were distributed as 
CD-ROMs with about 1 gigabyte of data each, 
compressed to fit. The training topics, the test topics 
62 
and the relevance judgments were supplied by email. 
These components of the test collection -- the docu- 
ments, the topics, and the relevance judgments, are dis- 
cussed in the rest of this section. 
3.1 The Documents 
The documents came from the following sources. 
Disk 1 
WSJ -- Wall Street Journal (1986, 1987, 1988, 1989) 
AP -- AP Newswire (1989) 
ZIFF -- Information from Computer Select disks 
(Ziff-Davis Pubfishing) 
FR -- Federal Register (1989) 
DOE -- Short abstracts from Department of Energy 
Disk 2 
WSJ -- Wall Street Journal (1990, 1991, 1992) 
AP -- AP Newswire (1988) 
ZIFF -- Information from Computer Select disks 
(Ziff-Davis Pubfishing) 
FR -- Federal Register (1988) 
The particular sources were selected because they 
reflected the different types of documents used in the 
imagined TREC application. Specifically they had a 
varied length, a varied writing style, a varied level of 
editing and a varied vocabulary. All participants were 
required to sign a detailed user agreement for the data in 
order to protect the copyrighted source material. The 
documents were uniformly formatted into an SGML-Iike 
structure, as can be seen in the following example.

American Telephone & Telegraph Co. introduced 
the first of a new generation of phone services with 
broad implications for computer and communications 
equipment markets. 
AT&T said it is the first national ong-distance car- 
tier to announce prices for specific services under a 
world-wide standardization plan to upgrade phone net- 
works. By announcing commercial services under the 
plan, which the industry calls the Integrated Services 
Digital Network, AT&T will influence volving com- 
munications tandards to its advantage, consultants 
said, just as International Business Machines Corp. has 
created de facto computer standards favoring its pro- 
ducts.

All documents had beginning and end markers, and a 
unique DOCNO id field. Additionally other fields taken 
from the initial data appeared, but these varied widely 
across the different sources. The documents also had 
different amounts of errors, which were not checked or 
corrected. Not only would this have been an impossible 
task, but the errors in the data provided a better simula- 
tion of the real-world tasks. Table 1 shows some basic 
document collection statistics.

Note that although the collection sizes are roughly 
equivalent in megabytes, there is a range of document 
lengths from very short documents (DOE) to very long 
(FR). Also the range of document lengths within a col- 
lection varies. For example, the documents from AP are 
similar in length (the median and the average length are 
very close), but the WSJ and ZIFF documents have a 
wider range of lengths. The documents from the Federal 
Register (FR) have a very wide range of lengths. 
What does this mean to the TREC task? First, a 
major portion of the effort for TREC-1 was spent in the 
system engineering necessary to handle the huge number 
of documents. This means that little time was left for 
system tuning or experimental runs, and therefore the 
TREC-1 results can best be viewed as a baseline for 
later research. The longer documents also required 
major adjustments o the algorithms themselves (or loss 
of performance). This is particularly true for the very 
long documents in FR. Since a relevant document might 
63 
contain only one or two relevant sentences, many algo- 
rithms needed adjustment from working with the abstract 
length documents found in the old collections. Addition- 
ally many documents were composite stories, with 
different opics, and this caused problems for most algo- 
rithms. 
3.2 The Topics 
In designing the TREC task, there was a conscious deci- 
sion made to provide "user need" statements rather than 
more traditional queries. Two major issues were 
involved in this decision. First there was a desire to 
allow a wide range of query construction methods by 
keeping the topic (the need statement) distinct from the 
query (the actual text submitted to the system). The 
second issue was the ability to increase the amount of 
information available about each topic, in particular to 
include with each topic a clear statement of what criteria 
make a document relevant. The topics were designed to 
mimic a real user's need, and were written by people 
who are actual users of a retrieval system. Although the 
subject domain of the topics was diverse, some con- 
sideration was given to the documents to be searched. 
The following is one of the topics used in TREC.

3.3 The Relevance Judgments 
The relevance judgments are of critical importance to a 
test collection. For each topic it is necessary to compile 
a list of relevant documents; hopefully as comprehensive 
a list as possible. Relevance judgments were made using 
a sampling method, with the sample constructed by 
taking the top 100 documents retrieved by each system 
for a given topic and merging them into a pool for 
relevance assessment. This sampling, known as pooling, 
proved to be an effective method. There was little over- 
lap among the 25 systems in their retrieved ocuments. 
For example, out of a maximum of 3300 unique docu- 
ments (33 runs times 100 documents), over one-third 
were actually unique. This means that the different sys- 
tems were finding different documents as likely relevant 
documents for a topic. One reason for the lack of over- 
lap is the very large number of documents that contain 
many of the same keywords as the relevant documents, 
but probably a larger reason is the very different sets of 
keywords in the constructed queries. This lack of over- 
lap should improve the coverage of the relevance set, 
and verifies the use of the pooling methodology to pro- 
duce the sample. 
The merged list of results was then shown to the human 
assessors. Each topic was judged by a single assessor to 
insure the best consistency of judgment and varying 
numbers of documents were judged relevant o the topics 
(with a median of about 250 documents). 
4. PREL IMINARY RESULTS 
An important element of TREC was to provide a com- 
mon evaluation forum. Standard recall/precision figures 
were calculated for each system and the tables and 
graphs for the results are presented in the proceedings. 
The results of the TREC-1 conference can be viewed 
only as a preliminary baseline for what can be expected 
from systems working with large test collections. There 
are several reasons for this. First, the deadlines for 
results were very tight, and most groups had minimal 
time for experiments. Additionally groups were working 
blindly as to what constitutes a relevant document. 
There were no reliable relevance judgments for training, 
and the use of the structured topics was completely new. 
It can be expected that the results seen at the second 
TREC conference will be much better, and also more 
indicative of how well a method works. 
However there were some clear trends that emerged. 
Automatic construction of queries proved to be as 
effective as manual construction of queries. Figure 2 
shows a comparison of four sets of results, two using 
automatic query construction and two using manual 
query construction, and it can be seen that there is rela- 
tively little difference between the results.

Figure 2 -- A Comparison of Adhoc Results using Different Query Construction Methods 
The two automatic systems hown used basically all 
the terms in the topic as query terms, and relied on 
automatic term weighting and sophisticated ranking algo- 
rithms for performance. The manual systems also used 
sophisticated term weighting and algorithms, but manu- 
ally selected which terms to include in a query. 
Several minor trends were also noticeable. Systems 
that worked with subdocuments, or used local term con- 
text to improve term weighting, seemed particularly suc- 
cessful in handling the longer documents in TREC. 
More systems may investigate this approach in TREC-2. 
Also systems that attempted to expand a topic beyond its 
original terms (either manually or automatically) seemed 
to do well, although it was often hard to properly control 
this expansion (particularly for automatically expanded 
queries). These trends may continue in TREC-2 and it 
is expected that clearer trends will emerge as groups 
have more time to work at this new task.
