Abstract
We describe our language-independent un-
supervised word sense induction system.
This system only uses topic features to
cluster different word senses in their global
context topic space. Using unlabeled data,
this system trains a latent Dirichlet alo-
cation (LDA) topic model then uses it to
infer the topics distribution of the test in-
stances. By clustering these topics dis-
tributions in their topic space we cluster
them into different senses. Our hypothesis
is that closeness in topic space reflects sim-
ilarity between different word senses. This
system participated in SemEval-2 word
sense induction and disambiguation task
and achieved the second highest V-measure
score among all other systems.
1 Introduction
Ambiguity of meaning is inherent in natural lan-
guage because the deliverer of words tries to mini-
mize the size of the vocabulary set he uses. There-
fore, a sizable portion of this vocabulary is polyse-
mous and the intended meaning of such words can
be encoded in their context.
Due to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck
problem and scarcity in training data (Cai et
al., 2007), unsupervised corpus based approaches
could be favored over supervised ones in word sense
disambiguation (WSD) tasks.
Similar efforts in this area include work by Cai
et al (Cai et al, 2007) in which they use latent
Dirichlet alocation (LDA) topic models to extract
the global context topic and use it as a feature
along other baseline features. Another technique
uses clustering based approach with WordNet as an
external resource for disambiguation without rely-
ing on training data (Anaya-Sa?nchez et al, 2007).
To disambiguate a polysemous word in a text
document, we use the document topic distribution
to represent its context. A document topic distri-
bution is the probabilistic distribution of a docu-
ment over a set of topics. The assumption is that:
given two word senses and the topic distribution

Figure 1: A graphical model for LDA
of their context, the closeness between these two
topic distributions in their topic space is an indi-
cation of the similarity between those two senses.
Our motivation behind building this system was
the observation that the context of a polysemous
word helps determining its sense to some degree.
In our word sense induction (WSI) system, we use
LDA to create a topic model for the given corpus
and use it to infer the topic distribution of the
documents containing the ambiguous words.
This paper describes our WSI system which par-
ticipated in SemEval-2 word sense induction and
disambiguation task (Manandhar et al, 2010).
2 Latent Dirichlet alocation
LDA is a probabilistic model for a collection of dis-
crete data (Blei et al, 2003). It can be graphically
represented as shown in Figure 1 as a three level
hierarchical Bayesian model. In this model, the
corpus consists of M documents, each is a multino-
mial distribution over K topics, which are in turn
multinomial distributions over words.
To generate a document d using this probabilis-
tic model, a distribution over topics ?
d
is generated
using a Dirichlet prior with parameter ?. Then,
for each of the N
d
words w
dn
in the document,
a topic z
dn
is drawn from a multinomial distribu-
tion with the parameter ?
d
. Then, a word w
dn
is
drawn from that topic?s distribution over words,
given ?
ij
= p(w = i?z = j). Where ?
ij
is the proba-
bility of choosing word i given topic j.
3 System description
We wanted to examine the trade-off between sim-
plicity, cost and performance by building a simple
367
language-independent, totally unsupervised, com-
putationally cheap system and compare its perfor-
mance to other WSI systems participating in the
SemEval-2 WSI task (Manandhar et al, 2010). We
expect a degradation in precision of our simple ap-
proach as the granularity of senses becomes finer;
This is due to the degrading sensitivity in mapping
between the topics space and the senses space. We
note that our simple approach will fail if multiple
senses of the same word appear in the same docu-
ment; Since these senses will be represented by the
same topic distribution of the document, they will
be clustered in the same cluster.
Our system is a language-independent system.
The used LDA topic model has no knowledge of
the training or testing corpus language. Unlike
most other WSI and WSD systems, it doesn?t make
use of part of speech (POS) features which are lan-
guage dependent and require POS annotated train-
ing data. The only features used are the topics dis-
tribution of bag-of-words containing the ambigu-
ous word.
First, for each target polysemous word wp (noun
or verb), we train a MALLET
1
parallel topic model
implementation of LDA on all the training in-
stances of that word. Then we use the trained topic
model to infer the topics distribution ?
l
for each of
the test instances of that word. For a K-topics
topic model, each topics distribution can be repre-
sented as a point in a K-dimensional topic space.
These points can be clustered into C different clus-
ters, each representing a word sense. We used
MALLET?s K-means clustering algorithm with co-
sine similarity to measure the distance between dif-
ferent topic distributions in the topic space.
4 Evaluation measures
We use the same unsupervised evaluation mea-
sures used in SemEval-2 (Manandhar and Kla-
paftis, 2009). These measures do not require de-
scriptive
The V-measure is used for unsupervised evalu-
ation. It is the harmonic mean of the homogene-
ity and completeness. Homogeneity is a measure
of the degree that each formed cluster consists of
data points that belong to a single gold standard
(GS) class as defined below.

refer to cluster and class sizes, respectively. N is
the number of data points, a

On the other hand, completeness measures the
degree that each class consists of data points that
belong to a single cluster. It is defined as follows.

Homogeneity and completeness can be seen as
entropy based measures of precision and recall, re-
spectively. The V-measure has a range of 0 (worst
performance) to 1, inclusive.
The other evaluation measure is the F-score,
which is the harmonic mean of precision and re-
call. It has a range of 0 to 1 (best performance),
inclusive.
5 Experiments and results
The WSI system described earlier was tested on
SemEval-1 WSI task (task 2) data (65 verbs,
35 nouns), and participated in the same task in
SemEval-2 (task 14) (50 verbs, 50 nouns). The
sense induction process was the same in both cases.
Before running our main experiments, we
wanted to see how the number of topics K used in
the topic model could affect the performance of our
system. We tested our WSI system on SemEval-1
data using different K values as shown in Table 1.
We found that the V-measure and F-score values
increase with increasing K, as more dimensions are
added to the topic space, the different senses in this
K-dimensional space unfold. This trend stops at a
value of K = 400 in a sign to the limited vocabu-
lary of the training data. This K value is used in
all other experiments.
Next, we evaluated the performance of our sys-
tem on SemEval-1 WSI task data. Since no train-
ing data was provided for this task, we used an un-
annotated version of the test instances to create the
LDA topic model. For each target word (verb or
noun), we trained the topic model on its given test

instances. Then we used the generated model?s in-
ferencer to find the topics distribution of each one
of them. These distributions are then clustered in
the topic space using the K-means algorithm and
the cosine similarity measure was used to evalu-
ate the distances between these distributions. The
results of this experiment are shown in Table 2.
Our WSI system took part in the main SemEval-
2 WSI task (task 14). In the unsupervised evalua-
tion, our system had the second highest V-measure
value of 15.7 for all words
2
. A break down of the
obtained V-measure and F-scores is shown in Table
3.
To analyze the performance of the system, we
examined the clustering of the target noun word
?promotion? to different senses by our system. We
compared it to the GS classes of this word in the
answer key provided by the task organizers. For
a more objective comparison, we ran the K-means
clustering algorithm with K equal to the number
of GS classes. Even though the number of formed
clusters affects the performance of the system, we
assume that the number of senses is known in this
analysis. We focus on the ability of the algorithm
to cluster similar senses together. A graphical com-
parison is given in Figure 2.
The target noun word ?promotion? has 27 in-
stances and four senses. The lower four rectangles
in Figure 2 represent the four different GS classes,
and the upper four rectangles represent the four
clusters created by our system. Three of the four
instances representing a job ?promotion? (?) were
clustered together, but the fourth one was clus-
tered in a different class due to terms like ?driv-
ing,? ?troops,? and ?hostile? in its context. The
offer sense of ?promotion? (?) was mainly split
between two clusters, cluster 2 which most of its
instances has mentions of numbers and monetary
units, and cluster 4 which describes business and
labor from an employee?s eye.
The 13 instances of the third class which carry
the sense encourage of the word promotion (?) are
distributed among the four different clusters de-

Figure 2: Analysis of sense clustering
pending on other topic words that classified them
as either belonging to cluster 4 (encouragement in
business), cluster 3 (encouragement in conflict or
war context), cluster 2 (numbers and money con-
text), or cluster 1 (otherwise). We can see that the
topic model is unable to detect and extract topic
words for the ?encourage? sense of the word. Fi-
nally, due to the lack of enough training instances
of the sense of a promotional issue of a newspaper
(?), the topic model inferencer clustered it in the
numbers and monetary cluster because it was rich
in numbers.
6 Conclusion
Clustering the topics distributions of the global
context of polysemous words in the topic space to
induce their sense is cheap as it does not require
any annotated data and is language-independent.
Even though the clustering produced by our sys-
tem did not fully conform with the set of senses
given by the GS classes, it can be seen from the
analyzed example given earlier that our cluster-
ing carried some different senses. In one case, a
GS sense was not captured by the topic model,
and instead, other cues from its instances context
were used to cluster them accordingly. The in-
duced clustering had some noise though.
This simple WSI approach can be used for cheap
sense induction or for languages for which no
POS tagger has been created yet. This system
which had the second highest V-measure score in
SemEval-2 WSI task achieves a good trade-off be-
tween performance and cost.
