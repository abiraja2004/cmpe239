The present deplorable state-of-the-art in the field of 
machine translation seems greatly due to a fundamental laok 
of formal translation models needed in natural language pro- 
cessing. 
From the methodological point of view it appears difflo- 
ult to delineate a borderline between translation theory and 
modern theoretical lingu~stlos (availing itself of model 
theoretical semantics) or full natural language understanding 
systems as developed in Artificial Intelligence research. It 
seems plausible to postulate that any prospective translation 
theory should draw on ideas from both fields. Unfortunately, 
problems discussed in painstaking detail in linguistics like 
differences in quantifier scope appear to be of lesser concern 
to a translator (since these ambiguities may well remain pres- 
ent in the target language) , neither seems a full or deep 
understanding necessary in many cases, standard syntactic 
phrasing may suffice. More specifically, we regard the pro- 
blems of disambi~ation, mandatory insertion of lexical items 
not conventionally implied in the source language and corefer- 
ence/anaphora resolution as the crucial problem areas of 
machine translation. 
In this paper, we will endeavour - in this preliminary 
draft only in a very sketchy manner - to set up a hierarchy of 
formal translation models ordered according to their inoreas-

i ng  sys temat ic  d i sambiguat ion  power fo r  cer ta in  types of  
texts .  
Quite analogous to comple.xity cons iderat ions  in  mathe- 
mat ics ,  the power of  a t rans la t ion  system i s  assumed to be 
measured by the  amount of s to rage  needed fo r  the lex ioa l  com- 
ponent (A~-people mAght ca l l  th i s  long-term-memory) and/or  
fo r  the t rans ient  or  dynamic data  (short - term-memory)  bu i l t  up 
duming the in terpret ing  process of  a par t i cu la r  text .  Any 
model w i l l  be capable  %o t rans la te  only  cer ta in  res t r i c ted  
types  of  texts  in  a sys temat ic  manner and wi th  sa t i s fac tory  
resu l t s ,  but the idea  i8  that  any model w i l l  a l so  conta in  
components of  lower  leve ls  of  complex i ty .  This i s  to make sure 
that  in  oases in  which d i sambigust ion  on pure ly  syntact i c  
grounds i s  poss ib le  no such process  v ia  "deep" semant ic  re -  
p resentat ions  w i l l  be attempted fo r  th i s  par t i cu la r  case.  The 
ra t iona le ,  of  course ,  w i l l  be to  u t i l i ze  ever  lexger  por t ions  
of  contextua l  (o r  ra ther  co - textua l )  in fo rmat ion  fo r  these  
ends.  As the reader  w i l l  no t i ce ,  power fu l l  t rans la t ion  system 
have to incorporate  more and more knowledge-o f - the  world in to  
the database ,  as becomes apparent  from the famous examples 
The so ld ie rs  shot the women. They fe l l  down.

Syntact i c  methods

i onary  would requ i re  a cons iderab le  amount of  s to rage  space 
in a oomputer) 
Level  Sy~:  Const i tuent  p reserv ing  t rans la t ion  
These models u t i l i ze  the immediate syntact i ca l  context  (e .g .  
valency of verbs) for dlsambiguatlon purposes. In such a sys- 
tem a rule may look llke 
x s lob  er innern  ~ x remember, but ,  x e r innern  y ~x  re -

At any ra te ,  a va lency  or iented  lex icon  would be he lp fu l  in  
the  fo l low ing  models ,  too .  The search  s t ra tegy  would be long-  
es t  match f i r s t .  
Leve l  Sy~3: T ree- to - t ree  t rans la t ion  
Unbouded t rans la t ions  a l low fo r  reorder ing  of  a rb i t ra r i l y  
long  por t ions  of a sentence .  We th ink  i t  reasonab le  to  assume 
that  a quar ter -century  of  Generat ive  Grammar esearch  in  
Linguistics will have produced enough theoretical and practlo- 
.1 apparatus to deal with any type of tree-restructurlng that 
may be needed in  d i rec t  syntact i c  t rans la t ions  between natura l  
languages  (a l so  o f .  the  F rench  sys tem GETA). 
Semant ic  methods 
Leve l  Seml  : Case.grammar or iented  t rans la t ions  
There are  severa l  MT systems that  impose heavy res t r i c t ions  
on the  poss ib le  arguments  of  verbs  by encod ing  semant ic  feat -  
ures in the lexicon (e.g. METEO in Canada). By this, of cour- 
se, d isambi~at ion  can take  p lace  on ly  w i th in  the  l im i ts  of  a 
s ing le  sentence  or  c lause .  
Leve l  Sere2: T rans la t ions  us ing  coherence  re la t ions  
The bas is  of  th i s  approach  i s  the  assumpt ion  that  there  ex is t  
f in i te ly  many determined  and computable coherence  re la t ions  
between two subsequent  sentences  and/or  c lauses  in  cer ta in  
types  of  texts .  (sometime ca l led  the  cohes ive - t ies -approach) .  
They may be even ind icat ions  of  these  re la t ions  a t  the  sur -  
face  level of the discours e.g. ~whereas?suggesting CONTRAST 
or ?then" suggesting TI~E-SEQUENCE, other relations may be 
ELABORATION, EFFECT, CAUSE (Hirer /1981/). Processing of these 
texts could be done by semantic finite state automata that 
would accept only highly constrained discourses in which no 
abrupt shifts of focus would be allowed. At last at this level 
of complexity It seems necessary to assume that the vocabulary 
should be organized - in addition to the usual lexioographlc

sub- themes  are  represented .  In  th i s  approach ,  coherence  re -

be es tab l i shed  - thus  a l low ing  fo r  oore feren  across  long  
d is tances  in  a text  (v ide  Rumelhar t  /1975/), Th is  p rocess  
may be facilitated by what Y. Wilks chose to call "paraplates" 
in the database. 
Level Sere4: Translations uslng semantic networks 
This model is designed for not so orderly texts as assumed in 
the previous levels. A semantic network as the dynsmlc macro- 
structure of & text would allow for multiple views or thema- 
tic structures associated with a portion of a text. To make 
this effective, a very rloh fabric of various types of assoc- 
iative links would be needed in the database. 
Level Sere5: 1~rsmevbased translations 
"Frames" or "scripts" have been widely discussed in the AI 
con:mx~ity In  the  past  10 years  o r  so .  The idea  seems to  bee  
to  aggregate  a l l  so r ts  of  in fo rmat ion  ob jeot~oent red  l inked
