Abstract 
This paper describes a hybrid model and 
the corresponding algorithm combining 
support vector machines (SVMs) with 
statistical methods to improve the per-
formance of SVMs for the task of Chi-
nese Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
In this algorithm, a threshold of the dis-
tance from the test sample to the hyper-
plane of SVMs in feature space is used to 
separate SVMs region and statistical 
method region. If the distance is greater 
than the given threshold, the test sample 
is classified using SVMs; otherwise, the 
statistical model is used. By integrating 
the advantages of two methods, the hy-
brid model achieves 93.18% F-measure 
for Chinese person names and 91.49% F-
measure for Chinese location names. 
1 Introduction 
Named entity (NE) recognition is a fundamental 
step to many language processing tasks such as 
information extraction (IE), question answering 
(QA) and machine translation (MT). On its own, 
NE recognition can also provide users who are 
looking for person or location names with quick 
information. Palma and Day (1997) reported that 
person (PER), location (LOC) and organization 
(ORG) names are the most difficult sub-tasks as 
compared to other entities as defined in Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC). So we focus 
on the recognition of PER, LOC and ORG enti-
ties. 
Recently, machine learning approaches are 
widely used in NER, including the hidden 
Markov model (Zhou and Su, 2000; Miller and 
Crystal, 1998), maximum entropy model 
(Borthwick, 1999), decision tree (Qin and Yuan, 
2004), transformation-based learning (Black and 
Vasilakopoulos, 2002), boosting (Collins, 2002; 
Carreras et al, 2002), support vector machine 
(Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Yu et al, 2004; 
Goh et al, 2003), memory-based learning (Sang, 
2002). SVM has given high performance in vari-
ous classification tasks (Joachims, 1998; Kudo 
and Matsumoto, 2001). Goh et al (2003) pre-
sented a SVM-based chunker to extract Chinese 
unknown words. It obtained higher F-measure 
for person names and organization names. 
Like other classifiers, the misclassified testing 
samples by SVM are mostly near the decision 
plane (i.e., the hyperplane of SVM in feature 
space). In order to increase the accuracy of SVM, 
we propose a hybrid model combining SVM 
with a statistical approach for Chinese NER, that 
is, in the region near the decision plane, statisti-
cal method is used to classify the samples instead 
of SVM, and in the region far away from the de-
cision plane, SVM is used. In this way, the mis-
classification by SVM near the decision plane 
can be decreased significantly. A higher F-
measure for Chinese NE recognition can be 
achieved. 
In the following sections, we shall describe 
our approach in details. 
2 Recognition of Chinese Named Entity 
Using SVM 
Firstly, we segment and assign part-of-speech 
(POS) tags to words in the texts using a Chinese 
lexical analyzer. Secondly, we break segmented 
words into characters and assign each character 
its features. Lastly, a model based on SVM to 
identify Chinese named entities is set up by 
choosing a proper kernel function. 
In the following, we will exemplify the person 
names and location names to illustrate the identi-
fication process.

2.1 Support Vector Machines 
Support Vector Machines first introduced by 
Vapnik (1996) are learning systems that use a 
hypothesis space of linear functions in a high 
dimensional feature space, trained with a learn-
ing algorithm from optimization theory that im-
plements a learning bias derived from statistical 
theory. SVMs are based on the principle of struc-
tural risk minimization. Viewing the data as 
points in a high-dimensional feature space, the 
goal is to fit a hyperplane between the positive 
and negative examples so as to maximize the 
distance between the data points and the hyper-
plane. 
Given training examples: 
},1,1{,)},,(),...,,(),,{( 2211 +???= iill ynRxyxyxyxS  (1) 
ix is a feature vector (n dimension) of the i-th 
sample.  is the class (positive(+1) or nega-
tive(-1) class) label of the i-th sample. l  is the 
number of the given training samples. SVMs find 
an ?optimal? hyperplane:  to sepa-
rate the training data into two classes. The opti-
mal hyperplane can be found by solving the fol-
lowing quadratic programming problem (we 
leave the details to Vapnik (1998)):

The function  is called

mary input space to feature space. Given a test 
example, its label y is decided by the following

Basically, SVMs are binary classifiers, and 
can be extended to multi-class classifiers in order 
to solve multi-class discrimination problems. 
There are two popular methods to extend a bi-
nary classification task to that of K classes: one 
class vs. all others and pairwise. Here, we em-
ploy the simple pairwise method. This idea is to 
build  classifiers considering all 
pairs of classes, and final decision is given by 
their voting.

2.2 Recognition of Chinese Person Names 
Based on SVM 
We use a SVM-based chunker, YamCha (Kudo 
and Masumoto, 2001), to extract Chinese person 
names from the Chinese lexical analyzer. 
1) Chinese Person Names Chunk Tags 
We use the Inside/Outside representation for 
proper chunks: 
I    Current token is inside of a chunk. 
O   Current token is outside of any chunk. 
B   Current token is the beginning of a chunk. 
A chunk is considered as a Chinese person 
name in this case. Every character in the training 
set is given a tag classification of B, I or O, that 
is, },,{ OIByi ? . Here, the multi-class decision 
method pairwise is selected. 
2) Features Extraction for Chinese Person 
Names 
Since Chinese person names are identified 
from the segmented texts, the mistakes of word 
segmentation can result in error identification of 
person names. So we must break words into 
characters and extract features for every charac-
ter. Table 1 summarizes types of features and 
their values.

Previous BIO tag B-character, I-character, O-character 
Table 1. Summary of Features and Their Values 
The POS tag from the output of lexical analy-
sis is subcategorized to include the position of 
the character in the word. The list of POS tags is 
shown in Table 2. 
 
POS tag Description of the position of the character in a word 
<POS>-S One-character word 
<POS>-B first character in a multi-character word 
<POS>-I intermediate character in a multi-character word 
<POS>-E last character in a multi-character word 
Table 2.  POS Tags in A Word 
If the character is a surname, the value is as-
signed to Y, otherwise assigned to N. 
The ?character? is surface form of the charac-
ter in the word. 
We extract all person names in January 1998 
of the People?s Daily to set up person names ta-
ble and calculate the frequency of every charac-
73
ter (F) of person names table in the training cor-
pus. The frequency of F is defined as 
,)(
  F of number  total  the
names person of character a as F of number the
FP = (4) 
if P(F) is greater than the given threshold, the 
value is assigned to Y, otherwise assigned to N.  
We also use previous BIO-tags as features. 
Whether a character is inside a person name or 
not, it depends on the context of the character. 
Therefore, we use contextual information of two 
previous and two successive characters of the 
current character as features. 
Figure 1 shows an example of features extrac-
tion for the i-th character. When training, the fea-
tures of the character ?Min? contains all the fea-
tures surrounded in the frames. If the same sen-
tence is used as testing, the same features are 
used.

2.3 Recognition of Chinese Location Names 
Based on SVM 
The identification process of location names is 
the same as that of person names except for the 
features extraction. Table 3 summarizes types of

traction.

names such as ?sheng (province)?, ?shi (city)?, 
?xian (county)?etc. If the character is in the loca-
tion names characteristic table, the value is as-
signed to Y, otherwise assigned to N. 
3 Statistical Models 
Many statistical models for NER have been pre-
sented (Zhang et al, 1992; Huang et al, 2003 
etc). In this section, we proposed our statistical 
models for Chinese person names recognition 
and Chinese location names recognition.     
3.1 Chinese Person Names 
We define a function to evaluate the person name 
candidate PN. The evaluated function Total-
Probability(PN) is composed of two parts: the 
lexical probability LP(PN) and contextual prob-
ability CP(PN) based on POS tags. 
),()1()()( PNCPPNLPPNbilityTotalProba ??+?=  (5) 
where PN is the evaluated person name and ? is 
the balance cofficient. 
1) lexical probability LP(PN)    
We establish the surname table (SurName) and 
the first name table (FirstName) from the 
students of year 1999 in a university (containing 
9986 person names). 
Suppose PN=LF1F2, where L is the surname 
of the evaluated person name PN, Fi (i=1,2) is the 
i-th first name of the evaluated person name PN.

where Cb is the balance cofficient between the

Cb=0.844 (Huang et al, 2001). 
2) contextual probability based on POS tags 
CP(PN) 
Chinese person names have characteristic 
contexual POS tags in real Chinese texts, for 
example, in the phrase ?dui Zhangshuai shuo 
(say to Zhangshuai)?, the POS tag before the 
person name ?Zhangshuai? is prepnoun and verb 
occurs after the person name. We define the 
bigram contextual probability CP(PN) of the 
person name PN as the following equation: 
CP(PN)= ,),,(
TotalPOS
rposPNlposPersonPOS ><            (9) 
where lpos is the POS tag of the character before 
PN (called POS forward), rpos is the POS tag of 
the character after PN (called POS backward), 
and is the number 
of PN as a pereson name whose POS forward is 
lpos and POS backward is rpos in training corpus. 
 is the total number of the contexual 
POS tags of every person name in the whole 
training corpus. 
),,( >< rposPNlposPersonPOS

3.2 Chinese Location Names 
We also define a function to evaluate the location 
name candidate LN. The evaluated function To-
talProbability(LN) is composed of two parts: the 
lexical probability LP (LN) and contextual prob-
ability CP (LN) based on POS tags. 
),()1()()( LNCPLNLPLNbilityTotalProba ??+?= (10) 
where LN is the evaluated location name and?  is

Suppose LN=F0F+S, F+=F1?Fn, (i=1,?,n), 
where F0 is the first character of the evaluated 
location name LN, F+ is the middle characters of 
the evaluated location name LN, S is the last 
character of the evaluated location name LN.

2) contextual probability based on POS tags CP

Location names also have characteristic 
contexual POS tags in real Chinese texts, for 
example, in the phrase ?zai Chongqing shi 
junxing (to be held in Chongqing)?, the POS tag 
before the location name ?Chongqing?is 
prepnoun and verb occurs after the location name. 
We define the bigram contextual probability 
CP(LN) of the location name LN similar to that 
of the person name PN in equation (9), where PN 
is replaced with LN. 
4 Recognition of Chinese Named Entity 
Using Hybrid Model 
Analyzing the classification results (obtained by 
sole SVMs described in section 2) between B 
and I, B and O, I and O respectively, we find that 
the error is mainly caused by the second classifi-
cation. The samples which attribute to B class 
are misclassified to O class, which leads to B 
class vote?s diminishing and the corresponding 
named entities are lost. Therefore the Recall is 
lower. In the meantime, the number of the mis-
classified samples whose function distances to 
the hyperplane of SVM in feature space are less 
than 1 can reach over 83% of the number of total 
misclassified samples. That means the misclassi-
75
fication of a classifier is occurred in the region of 
two overlapping classes. Considering this fact, 
we can expect to improve SVM using the follow-
ing hybrid model. 
The hybrid model includes the following 
procedure: 
1) compute the distance from the test sample 
to the hyperplane of SVM in feature space.  
2) compare the distance with given threshold. 
The algorithm of hybrid model can be de-
scribed as follows:

5 Experiments 
Our experimental results are all based on the 
corpus of Peking University. 
5.1 Extracting Chinese Person Names 
We use 180 thousand characters corpus of year 
1998 from the People?s Daily as the training cor-
pus and extract other sentences (containing 1526 
Chinese person names) as testing corpus to con-
duct an open test experiment. The results are ob-
tained as follows based on different models. 
1) Based on Sole SVM 
An experiment is carried out to recognize Chi-
nese person names based on sole SVM by the 
method as described in Section 2. The Recall, 
Precision and F-measure using different number 
of degree of polynomial kernel function are 
given in Table 4. The best result is obtained 
when d=2.

d=3 84.67% 95.14% 89.60% 
Table 4. Results for Person Names Extraction 
Based on Sole SVM 
 
2) Using Hybrid Model 
As mentioned in section 4, the test samples 
which attribute to B class are misclassified to O 
class and therefore the Recall for person names 
extraction from sole SVM is lower. So we only 
deal with the test samples (B class and O class) 
whose function distances to the hyperplane of 
SVM in feature space (i.e. g(x)) is between 0 and 
? . We move class-boundary learned by SVM 
towards the O class, that is, the O class samples 
are considered as B class in that area. 93.64% of 
the Chinese person names in testing corpus are 
recalled when ? =0.9 (Here, ?  also represents 
how much the boundary is moved). However, a 
number of non-person names are also identified 
as person names wrongly and the Precision is 
decreased correspondingly. Table 5 shows the 
Recall and Precision of person names extraction 
with different ? .

Table 5. Results for Person Names Extraction

We use the evaluated function TotalProbabil-
ity(PN) as described in section 3 to filter the 
wrongly recalled person names using SVM. We 
tune?  in equation (5) to obtain the best results. 
The results based on the hybrid model with dif-
ferent ?  are listed in Table 6 (when d=2). We 
can observe that the result is best when ? =0.4. 
Table 7 shows the results based on the hybrid 
model with different ?  when =0.4. We can 
observe that the Recall rises and the Precision 
drops on the whole when 
?
?  increases. The syn-
thetic index F-measures are improved when ?  is 
between 0.1 and 0.8 compared with sole SVM. 
The best result is obtained when ? =0.3. The Re-
call and the F-measure increases 3.27% and 
1.77% respectively.

5.2 Extracting Chinese Location Names 
We use 1.5M characters corpus of year 1998 
from the People?s Daily as the training corpus 
and extract sentences of year 2000 from the Peo-
ple?s Daily (containing 2919 Chinese location 
names) as testing corpus to conduct an open test 
experiment. The results are obtained as follows 
based on different models. 
1) Based on Sole SVM 
The Recall, Precision and F-measure using 
different number of degree of polynomial kernel 
function are given in Table 8. The best result is 
obtained when d=2.

2) Using Hybrid Model 
The results for Chinese location names extrac-
tion based on the hybrid model are listed in Ta-
ble 9 (when d=2; ? =0.2 in equation (10)). We 
can observe that the Recall rises and the Preci-
sion drops on the whole when ?  increases. The 
synthetic index F-measures are improved when 
?  is between 0.1 and 0.7 compared with sole 
SVM. The best result is obtained when ? =0.3. 
The Recall increases 3.55%, the Precision de-
creases 1.05% and the F-measure increases 
1.37%.

6 Comparison with other work 
The same corpus was also tested using statistics-
based approach to identify Chinese person names 
(Huang et al 2001) and location names (Huang 
and Yue, 2003). In their systems, lexical reliabil-
ity and contextual reliability were used to iden-
tify person names and location names calculated 
from statistical information drawn from a train-
ing corpus. The results of our models and the 
statistics-based methods (Huang 2001; Huang 
2003) are shown in Table 10 for comparison. We 
can see that the Recall and F-measure in our 
method all increase a lot.

7 Conclusions and Future work 
We recognize Chinese named entities using a 
hybrid model combining support vector ma-
chines with statistical methods. The model inte-
grates the advantages of two methods and the 
experimental results show that it can achieve 
higher F-measure than the sole SVM and indi-
vidual statistical approach. 
  Future work includes optimizing statistical 
models, for example, we can add the probability 
information of Chinese named entities in real 
texts to compute lexical probability, and we can 
77
also use trigram models to compute contextual 
probability. 
The hybrid model is expected to extend to for-
eign names in transliteration to obtain improved 
results by sole SVMs. The identification of trans-
literated names by SVMs has been completed (Li 
et al, 2004). The future work includes: set up 
statistical models for transliterated names and 
combine statistical models with SVMs to identify 
transliterated names.
