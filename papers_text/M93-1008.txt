INTRODUCTION
The statistical significance of the results of the MUC-5 evaluation is determined using a computer-intensiv e
method of hypothesis testing known as approximate randomization . The exact method is described in detail in 111 an d
[2] and has been used as the accepted statistical test for the MUC results since MUC-3 . The purpose of the statistica l
testing is to determine whether the scores of the systems are different by chance or due to a significant difference i n
the character of the systems .
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE RESULT S
Statistical significance results are reported here for the following metrics : Error per Response Fill, F-Mca-
sure with recall and precision weighted equally, and Richness-Normalized Error (minimum and maximum) . The sys-
tems are compared for the same domain and language and, thus, there are four figures for each metric : English Join t
Ventures (EJV), Japanese Joint Ventures (JJV), English Microelectronics (EME), and Japanese Microelectronics
(JME) . The format of the reporting is according to the groupings of the systems which are not significantly differen t
from each other at the 0.01 level with a confidence of at least 99% . Systems which are not significantly different fro m
each other are underscored on the same line . The systems are numbered to save space and the correspondence of th e
number and system site are given below the significance results .
It is interesting to note that the rankings of systems do not change when using the Error per Response Fil l
metric or the F-Measure. The numerical rankings change slightly (numbers 6 and 7 in EJV reverse, and numbers 4
and 5 in JJV reverse), but those changes are not significant statistically because the two members in each of th e
reversed pairs are both in the same significance grouping for both of the two metrics . It is also interesting to note tha t
the Error per Response Fill metric distinguishes four more systems than the F-Measure over all domains and lan-
guages . The Richness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems statistically than the Error pe r
Response Fill metric with 29 systems distinguished by Richness-Normalized Error as opposed to 55 by Error per
Response Fill for EJV alone . Both the minimum and maximum Richness-Normalized Error metrics produce the sam e
rankings and statistical results so are conflated here . The statistical groupings of systems for Richness-Normalized
Error are so large and so numerous that systems cannot be distinguished well enough to reflect their perceived differ-
ences in performance . It is believed that this is due to the fact that the Richness-Normalized Error metric ignores th e
amount of spurious data generated by a system and that the amount and kind of spurious data generated impacts th e
perception of how well the system is doing in an operational setting .
CONCLUSIONS
The approximate randomization method has been used to determine the statistical significance of the rank-
ings of systems for MUC-5 . It is also useful for reflecting on the relative merits of the evaluation metrics . The statis-
tical results show that the Error per Response Fill metric is the most sensitive metric of the three in terms o f
distinguishing systems. However, no statistically significant changes in ranking occur when F-Measure is used . The
Richness-Normalized Error metric distinguishes far fewer systems than either of the other metrics .
