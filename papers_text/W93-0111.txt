ABSTRACT 
Bootstrap methods (unsupervised 
classification) that generate word classes 
without requiring pretagging have had 
notable success in the last few years. The 
methods described here strengthen these 
approaches and produce excellent word classes 
from a 200,000 word corpus. The method uses 
mutual information measures plus positional 
information from the words in the immediate 
context of a target word to compute 
similarities. Using the similarities, classes 
are built using hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering. At the leaves of the classification 
tree, words are grouped by syntactic and 
semantic similarity. Further up the tree, the 
classes are primarily syntactic. Once the 
initial classes are found, they can be used to 
classify ambiguous words, i.e., part-of-speech 
tagging. This is done by expanding each 
context word of a target instance into a tightly 
defined class of similar words, a simsct. The 
use of simsets is shown to increase the tagging 
accuracy from 83% to 92% for the forms 
"cloned" and "deduced". 
INTRODUCTION 
The identification of the syntactic lass

words not contained in any on-line dictionary

problem. Excellent methods have been 
developed for part-of-speech (POS) tagging 
using stochastic models trained on partially 
tagged corpora (Church, 1988; Cutting, 
Kupiec, Pedersen & Sibun, 1992). Semantic 
issues have been addressed, particularly for 
sense disambiguation, by using large contexts, 
e.g., 50 nearby words (Gale, Church & 
Yarowsky, 1992) or by reference to on-line 
dictionaries (Krovetz, 1991; Lesk, 1986; Liddy 
& Paik, 1992; Zernik, 1991). More recently, 
methods to work with entirely untagged 
corpora have been developed which show great 
promise (Brill & Marcus, 1992; Finch & 
Chater, 1992; Myaeng & Li, 1992; Schutze, 
1992). They are particularly useful for text 
with specialized vocabularies and word use. 
These methods of unsupervised classification 
typically have clustering algorithms at their 
heart (Jain & Dubes, 1988). They use 
similarity of contexts (the distribution 
principle) as a measure of distance in the 
space of words and then cluster similar words 
into classes. This paper demonstrates a 
particular approach to these classification 
techniques. 
In our approach, we take into account both 
the relative positions of the nearby context 
words as well as the mutual information 
(Church & Hanks, 1990) associated with the 
occurrence of a particular context word. The 
similarities computed from these measures of 
the context contain information about both 
syntactic and semantic relations. For 
example, high similarity values are obtained 
for the two semantically similar nouns, 
117 
"diameter" and "length", as well as for the two 
adjectives "nonmotile" and "nonchemotactic". 
We demonstrate the technique on three 
problems, all using a 200,000 word corpus 
composed of 1700 abstracts from a specialized 
field of biology: #1: Generating the full 
classification tree for the 1,000 most frequent 
words (covering 80% of all word occurrences). 
#2: The classification of 138 occurrences of 
the -ed forms, "cloned" and "deduced" into four 
syntactic categories, including improvements 
by using expanded context information 
derived in #1. #3: The classification of 100 
words that only occur once in the entire corpus 
(hapax legomena), again using expanded 
contexts. 
The results described below were obtained 
using no pretagging or on-line dictionary, but 
the results compare favorably with methods 
that do. The results are discussed in terms of 
the semantic fields they delineate, the 
accuracy of the classifications and the nature 
of the errors that occur. The results make it 
clear that this new technology is very 
promising and should be pursued vigorously. 
The power of the approach appears to result 
from using a focused corpus, using detailed 
positional information, using mutual 
information measures and using a clustering 
method that updates the detailed context 
information when each new cluster is formed. 
Our approach was inspired by the fascinating 
results achieved by Finch and Chater at 
Edinburgh and the methods they used (Finch 
& Chater, 1992). 
THE CORPUS - -  TECHNICAL ,  
FOCUSED AND SMALL  
In the Biological Knowledge Laboratory 
we are pursuing a number of projects to 
analyze, store and retrieve biological research 
papers, including working with full text and 
graphics (Futrelle, Kakadiaris, Alexander, 
Carriero, Nikolakis & Futrelle, 1992; Gauch & 
Futrelle, 1993). The work is focused on the 
biological field of bacterial chemotaxis. A 
biologist has selected approximately 1,700 
documents representing all the work done in 
this field since its inception in 1965. Our 
study uses the titles for all these documents 
plus all the abstracts available for them. The 
resulting corpus contains 227,408 words with 
13,309 distinct word forms, including 5,833 
words of frequency 1. There are 1,686 titles 
plus 8,530 sentences in the corpus. The 
sentence identification algorithm requires two 
factors -- contiguous punctuation C.", "!", or 
"?") and capitalization of the following token. 
To eliminate abbreviations, the token prior to 
the punctuation must not be a single capital 
letter and the capitalized token after the 
punctuation may not itself be followed by a 
contiguous ".".

The positional items $pre... and $pos... 
have been added to furnish explicit context for 
sentence initial and sentence final 
constituents. Numbers have been converted 
to three forms corresponding to integers, reals 
and percentages C$pct$ in the example 
above). The machine-readable version of the 
corpus uses double quoted items to ease 
processing by Lisp, our language of choice. 
The terminology we will use for describing 
words is as follows: 
? Target  word: A word to be classified. 
Context  words: Appearing within 
some distance of a target word, 
"The big ~ cat 9.a the mat...". 
? Word class: Any defined set of word 
forms or labeled instances. 
Simset:  A word class in which each 
item, an expansion word, has a 
similarity greater than some chosen 
cutoffto a single base word. 
? Labeled instances: Forms such as 
"cloned48" or "cloned73VBN", that 
118 
would replace an occurrence of 
"cloned". 
DESCRIB ING AND 
QUANTIFY ING WORD 
CONTI~TS 
In these experiments, the context of a 
target word is described by the preceding two 
context words and the following two context 
words, Figure 1. Each position is represented 
by a 150 element vector corresponding to the 
occurrence of the 150 highest frequency words 
in the corpus, giving a 600-dimensional vector 
describing the four-word context. Initially, the 
counts from all instances of a target word form 
w are summed so that the entry in the 
corresponding context word position in the 
vector is the sum of the occurrences of that 
context word in that  position for the 
corresponding target word form; it is the joint 
frequency of the context word. For example, if 
the word the immediately precedes 10 
occurrences of the word gene in the corpus 
then the element corresponding to the in the 
-1C context vector of gene is set to 10. 
Subsequently, a 600-dimensional vector of 
mutual information values, MI, is computed 
from the frequencies as follows, 
log 2 NZ~ + Ml(cw)= \ [ . \ ] . j1 \ ]  
This expresses the mutual information 
value for the context word c appearing with 
the target word w. The mutual information is 
large whenever a context word appears at a 
much higher frequency, fcw, in the 
neighborhood of a target word than would be 
predicted from the overall frequencies in the 
corpus, fc and fw. The formula adds 1 to the 
frequency ratio, so that a 0 (zero) occurrence 
corresponds to 0 mutual information. A 
possibly better strategy (Church, Gale, Hanks 
& Hindle, 1991) is capable of generating 
negative mutual information for the non- 
occurrence or low-frequency occurrence of a 
very high-frequency word and has the form, 
? fN(~ +I)'~ Ml(cw) = log 2 ~ . / 
\[ I#.  J 
In any case, some smoothing is necessary 
to prevent the mutual  information from 
diverging when fcw= O.

When the mutual information vectors are 
computed for a number of words, they can be 
compared to see which words have similar 
contexts. The comparison we chose is the 
inner product, or cosine measure, which can 
vary between -1.0 and +1.0 (Myaeng & Li, 
1992). Once this similarity is computed for all 
word pairs in a set, various techniques can be 
used to identify classes of similar words. The 
method we chose is hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering (Jain & Dubes, 1988). The two 
words with the highest similarity are first 
jo ined  into a two-word  c lus ter .

frequency words, HFC, in the corpus.

A mutual information vector for the 
cluster is computed and the cluster and 
remaining words are again compared, 
choosing the most similar to join, and so on. 
(To compute the new mutual information 
vector, the context frequencies in the vectors 
for the two words or clusters joined at each 
step are summed, element-wise.) In this way, 
a binary tree is constructed with words at the 
leaves leading to a single root covering all 
words. Each cluster, anode in the binary tree, 
is described by an integer denoting its position 
in the sequence of cluster formation, the total 
number of words, the similarity of the two 
children that make it up, and its member 
words. Here, for example, are the first 15 
clusters from the analysis described in

(I5 3 0.5652546 mutants (ce l ls  strains)) 
In this sample it is clear that clusters are 
sometimes formed by the pairing of two 
individual words, sometimes by pairing one 
word and a previous cluster, and sometimes 
by combining two already formed clusters. 
In normal tagging, a word is viewed as a 
member of one of a small number of classes. 
In the classification approach we are using, 
there can be thousands of classes, from pairs 
of words up to the root node which contains all 
words in a single class. Thus, every class 
generated is viewed extensionally, it is a 
structured collection of occurrences in the 
corpus, with their attendant frequencies and 
contexts. The classes so formed will reflect 
the particular word use in the corpus they are 
derived from. 
EXPERIMENT #1: 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE 1,000 
HIGHEST FREQUENCY WORDS 
The first experiment classified the 1,000 
highest frequency words in the corpus, 
producing 999 clusters (0-998) during the 
process. $pre... and Spas... words were 
included in the context set, but not in the 
target set. Near the leaves, words clustered 
by syntax (part of speech) and by semantics. 
Later, larger clusters tended to contain words 
of the same syntactic class, but with less 
semantic homogeneity. In each example 
below, the words listed are the entire contents 
of the cluster mentioned. The most striking 
property of the clusters produced was the 
classification of words into coherent semantic 
fields. Grefenstette has pointed out 
(Grefenstette, 1992) that the Deese antonyms, 
such as "large" and "small" or "hot" and "cold" 
show up commonly in these analyses. Our 
methods discovered entire graded fields, 
rather than just pairs of opposites. The 
following example shows a cluster of 
seventeen adjectives describing comparative 
quantity terms, cluster 756, similarity 0.28, 
decreased, effective, few, greater, high, 
higher, increased, large, less, low, 
lower, more, much, no, normal, 
reduced, short 
Note that pairs such as "high" and 
"higher" and "low" and "lower" appear. "No", 
meaning "none" in this collection, is located at 
one extreme. The somewhat marginal item, 
"effective", entered the cluster late, at cluster 
704. It appears in collocations, uch as "as 
effective as" and "effective than", in which the 
other terms also appear. Comparing the 
cluster to Roger's (Berrey, 1962) we find that 
all the items are in the Roget category 
Comparative Quantity except for "effective" 
and "no". The cluster item, "large" is not in 
this Roget category but the category does 
include "big", "huge" and "vast", so the 
omission is clearly an error in Roget's. With 
120 
this correction, 88% (15/17) of the items are in 
the single Roget category. 
The classification of technical terms from 
genetics and biochemistry is of particular 
interest, because many of these terms do not 
appear in available dictionaries or thesauri. 
Cluster 374, similarity 0.37, contains these 18 
items, 
che, cheA, cheB, cheR, cheY, cheZ, double, 
fla, flaA, taB,  flaE, H2, hag, mot, 
motB, tar, trg, tsr 
All of these are abbreviations for specific 
bacterial mutations, except for "double". Its 
appearance drives home the point that the 
classification depends entirely on usage. 20 of 
the 30 occurrences of "double" precede the 
words "mutant" or "mutants", as do most of 
the othermutation terms in this cluster. 
Cluster 240, similarity 0.4 contains these 
termS, 
microscopy, electrophoresis, 
chromatography 
Each of these is a noun describing a 
common technique used in experiments in this 
domain. 
The standard Linnean nomenclature of 
Genus followed by species, such as Escherichia 
coli, is reflected by cluster 414, which contains 
22 species names, and cluster 510, which 
contains 9 genus names. 
In scientific research, the determination of
causal factors and the discovery of essential 
elements is a major goal. Here are six 
concepts in this semantic field comprising 
cluster 183, similarity 0.43, 
required, necessary, involved, responsible, 
essential, important 
These te rms are used a lmost  
interchangeably in our corpus, but they don't 
fare as well in Roget's because of 
anthropocentric attachments o concepts uch 
as fame, duty and legal liability. 
Discussion of Experiment #1 
Given the limited context and modest 
sized corpus, the classification algorithm is 
bound to make mistakes, though a study of 
the text concordance will always tell us why 
the algorithm failed in any specific case. For 
example, as the similarity drops to 0.24 at 
cluster 824 we see the adverb triple "greatly", 
"rapidly" and "almost". This is still 
acceptable, but by cluster 836 (similarity 0.24) 
we see the triple, "them", "ring", "rings". At 
the end there is only a single cluster, 998, 
which must include all words. It comes 
together stubbornly with a negative similarity 
of-0.51. One problem encountered in this 
work was that the later, larger clusters have 
less coherence than we would hope for, 
identifying an important research issue. 
Experiment #1 took 20 hours to run on a 
Symbolics XL1200. 
A fundamental problem is to devise 
decision procedures that will tell us which 
classes are semantically or syntactically 
homogeneous; procedures that tell us where to 
cut the tree. The examples shown earlier 
broke down soon after, when words or clusters 
which in our judgment were weakly related 
began to be added. We are exploring the 
numerous methods to refine clusters once 
formed as well as methods to validate clusters 
for homogeneity (Jain & Dubes, 1988). There 
are also resampling methods to validate 
clusters formed by top-down partit ioning 
methods (Jain & Moreau, 1987). All of these 
methods are computationally demanding but 
they can result in criteria for when to stop 
clustering. On the other hand, we mustn't 
assume that word relations are so simple that 
we can legitimately insist on finding neatly 
separated clusters. Word relations may 
simply be too complex and graded for this ever 
to occur. 
The semantic fields we discovered were 
not confined to synonyms. To understand why 
this is the case, consider the sentences, "The 
temperature is higher today." and, "The 
temperature is lower today." There is no way 
to tell from the syntax which word to expect. 
The choice is dependent on the situation in the 
world; it represents data from the world. The 
121 
utterances are informative for just that 
reason. Taking this reasoning a step further, 
information theory would suggest that for two 
contrasting words to be maximally 
informative, they should appear about equally 
often in discourse. This is born out in our 
corpus (fhigher=58, i~ower=46) and for the 
Brown corpus (fhigher=147, fiower=110). The 
same relations are found for many other 
contrasting pairs, with some bias towards 
"positive" terms. The most extreme "positive" 
bias in our corpus is fposs ib le=88,  
fimpossible=0; "never say never" seems to be 
the catchphrase here - -  highly appropriate for 
the field of biology. 
Some of the chemical term clusters that 
were generated are interesting because they 
contain class terms such as "sugar" and "ion" 
along with specific members of the classes 
(hyponyms), such as "maltose" and "Na +''. 
Comparing these in our KWIC  concordance 
suggests that there may be methodical 
techniques for identifying some of these 
generalization hierarchies using machine 
learning (supervised classification) (Futrelle & 
Gauch, 1993). For another discussion of 
attempts to generate generalization 
hierarchies, see (Myaeng & Li, 1992). 
As a corpus grows and new words appear, 
one way to classify them is to find their 
similarity to the N words for which context 
vectors have already been computed. This 
requires N comparisons. A more efficient 
method which would probably give the same 
result would be to successively compare the 
word to clusters in the tree, starting at the 
root. At each node, the child which is most 
similar to the unclassified word is followed. 
This is a logarithmic search technique for 
finding the best matching class which takes 
only O(log2N) steps. In such an approach, 
the hierarchical cluster is being used as a 
decision tree, which have been much studied 
in the machine learning literature (Quinlan, 
1993). This is an alternate view of the 
classification approach as the unsupervised 
learning of a decision tree. 
EXPERIMENT #2: 
DISAMBIGUATION OF -ED 
FORMS 
The following experiment is interesting 
because it shows a specific use for the 
similarity computations. They are used here 
to increase the accuracy of term 
disambiguation which means selecting the 
best tag or class for a potentially ambiguous 
word. Again, this is a bootstrap method; no 
prior tagging is needed to construct he 
classes. But if we do identify the tags for a 
few items by hand or by using a hand-tagged 
reference corpus, the tags for all the other 
items in a cluster can be assumed equal to the 
known items. 
The passive voice is used almost 
exclusively in the corpus, with some use of the 
editorial "We". This results in a profusion of 
participles such as "detected", "sequenced" and 
"identified". But such -ed forms can also be 
simple past tense forms or adjectives. In 
addition, we identified their use in a 
postmodifying participle clause such as, 
"... the value ~ from this 
measurement." Each one of the 88 instances 
of "cloned" and the 50 instances of "deduced" 
was hand tagged and given a unique ID. Then 
clustering was applied to the resulting 
collection, giving the result shown in 
Figure 2A. Experiments #2 and #3 took about 
15 minutes each to run. 
The resultant clusters are somewhat 
complex. There are four tags and we have 
shown the top four clusters, but two of the 
clusters contain adjectives exclusively. The 
past participle and postmodifier occur together 
in the same cluster. (We studied the children 
of cluster 4, hoping to find better separation, 
but they are no better. ) The scoring metric 
we chose was to associate each cluster with 
the items that were in the majority in the 
node and score all other items as errors. This 
is a good approximation to a situation in 
which a "gold standard" is available to classify 
the clusters by independent means, such as 
comparing the clusters to items from a 
pretagged re ference corpus.

Figure 2A. Clustering of 88 occurrence of"cloned" and 50 occurrences of"deduced" into four 
syntactic categories. The abbreviations, such as "JJ", are based on (Francis & Kucera, 1982). 
There is a strong admixture of adjectives in cluster 2 and all the postmodifiers are 
confounded with the past participles in cluster 4. The total number of errors (minority 
classes in a cluster) is 23 for a success rate of(138-23)/138 = 83%. 
All minority members  of a cluster are 
counted as errors. This leads to the 83% error 
rate quoted in the figure caption. 
The results shown in Figure 2A can be 
improved as follows. Because we are dealing 
with single occurrences, only one element, or 
possibly zero, in each of the four context word 
vectors is filled, with frequency 1. The other 
149 elements have frequency (and mutual 
information) 0.0. These sparse vectors will 
therefore have little or no overlap with vectors 
from other occurrences. In order to try to 
improve the classification, we expanded the 
context values in an effort to produce more 
overlap, using the following strategy: We 
proceed as if the corpus is far larger so that in 
addition to the actual context words already 
seen, there are many occurrences of highly 
similar words in the same positions. For each 
non-zero context in each set of 150, we expand 
it to an ordered class of similar words in the 
150, picking words above a fixed similarity 
threshold (0.3 for the experiments reported 
here). Such a class is called a simset, made up 
of a base word and a sequence  of expansion 
words. 
As an example of the expansion of context 
words via simsets, suppose that the 
occurrence of the frequency 1 word 
"cheA-cheB" is immediately preceded by "few" 
and the occurrence of the frequency 1 word 
"CheA/CheB" is immediately preceded by 
"less". The -I C context vectors for each will 
have l's in different positions so there will be 
no overlap between them. If we expanded 
"few" into a large enough simset, the set would 
eventually contain, "less", and vice-versa. 
Barring that, each simset might contain a 
distinct common word such as "decreased". In 
either case, there would now be some overlap 
in the context vectors so that the similar use 
of "cheA-cheB" and "CheA/CheB" could be 
detected. 
The apparent frequency of each expansion 
word is based on its corpus frequency relative 
to the corpus frequency of the word being 
expanded. To expand a single context word 
instance ci appearing with frequency fik in the 
context of 1 or more occurrences of center 
word wk, choose all cj such that cj e {set of 
high-frequency context words} and the 
123 
similarity S(ci,cj) _> St, a threshold value. Set 
the apparent frequency of each expansion 
word cj to fjk = S(ci,cj)xfik x fj / fi , where fi 
and fj are the corpus frequencies of ci and cj. 
Normalize the total frequency of the context 
word plus the apparent frequencies of the 
expansion words to fik. For the example being 
discussed here, fik = 1, St=0.3 and the average 
number of expansion words was 6. 
Recomputing the classification of the -ed 
forms with the expanded context words results 
in the improved classification shown in Figure 
2B. The number of classification errors is 
halved, yielding a success rate of 92%. This is 
comparable in performance to many stochastic 
tagging algorithms. 
Discussion of Experiment #2 
This analysis is very similar to part-of- 
speech tagging. The simsets of only 6 items 
are far smaller than the part-of-speech 
categories conventionally used. But since we 
use high frequency words, they represent a 
substantial portion of the instances. Also, 
they have higher specificity than, say, Verb. 
Many taggers work sequentially and depend 
on the left context. But some words are best 
classified by their right context. We supply 
both. Clearly this small experiment did not 
reach the accuracy of the very best taggers, 
but it performed well. 
This experiment has major ramifications 
for the future. The initial classifications found 
merged all identical word forms together, both 
as targets and contexts. But disambiguation 
techniques uch as those in Experiment #2 
can be used to differential ly tag word 
occurrences with some degree of accuracy. 
These newly classified items can in turn be 
used as new target and context items (if their 
frequencies are adequate) and the analysis 
can be repeated. Iterating the method in this 
way should be able to refine the classes until a 
fixed point is reached at which no further 
improvement in classification occurs. The 
major challenge in using this approach will be 
to keep it computationally tractable. This 
approach is similar in spirit to the iterative 
computational approaches of the Hidden 
Markov Models (Kupiec, 1989; Kupiec, 1992; 
Rabiner, 1989), though our zeroth order 
solution begins quite close to the desired 
result, so it should converge very close to a 
global optimum.

number of errors is reduced from 23 to 11, for a success rate of 92%.

EXPERIMENT #3: 
CLASSIFICATION OF SINGLE 
WORD OCCURRENCES 
When classifying multiple instances of a 
single word form as we did in Experiment #2, 
there are numerous collocations that aid the 
classification. For example, 16 of the 50 
occurrences of the word "deduced" occur in the 
phrase, "of the ~ amino acid sequence". 
But with words of frequency 1, we cannot rely 
on such similarities. Nevertheless, we 
experimented with classifying 100 words of 
corpus frequency 1 with and without 
expanding the context words. Though hand 
scoring the results is difficult, we estimate 
that there were 8 reasonable pairs found 
initially and 26 pairs when expansion was 
used. 
Examples of words that paired well 
without expansion are "overlaps" and "flank" 
(due to a preceding "which") and "malB" and 
"cheA-cheB" (due to the context "...the 
\[malB, cheA-cheB\] region...").  After  
expansion, pairs such as "setting", "resetting" 
appeared (due in part to the expansion of the 
preceding "as" and "to" context words into 
simsets which both included "with", "in" and 
"by"). 
Discussion of Exper iment  #3. 
The amount of information available about 
frequency 1 words can vary from a lot to 
nothing at all, and most frequently tends to 
the latter, viz., "John and Mary looked at the 
blork." Nevertheless,  such words are 
prominent, 44% of our corpus' vocabulary. 
About half Of them are non-technical and can 
therefore be analyzed from other corpora or 
on-line dictionaries. Word morphology and 
Latinate morphology in particular, can be 
helpful. Online chemical databases,  
supplemented with rules for chemical 
nomenclature will clarify additional items, 
e .g . ,  "2-epoxypropylphosphonic"  or 
"phosphoglucomutase-deflcient". 
Furthermore, there are naming conventions 
for genetic strains and mutants which aid 
recognition. The combination of all these 
methods hould lead to a reasonable accuracy 
in the classification of frequency 1words. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION AND 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
Our corpus of 220,000 words is much 
smaller than ones of 40 million words (Finch 
& Chater, 1992) and certainly of 360 million 
(Brown, Della Pietra, deSousa, Lai & Mercer, 
1992). But judging by the results we have 
presented, especially for the full 1,000 word 
clustering, our corpus appears to make up in 
specificity for what it lacks in size. Extending 
this work beyond abstracts to full papers will 
be challenging because our corpus requires 
SGML markup to deal with Greek characters, 
superscripts and subscripts, etc. (Futrelle, 
Dunn, Ellis & Pescitelli, 1991). We have over 
500,000 words from the bacterial chemotaxis 
research papers carefully marked up by hand 
in this way. 
The characterization of context can 
obviously be extended to more context 
positions or words, and extensions of our 
word-rooted expansion techniques are 
potentially very powerful, combining broad 
coverage with specificity in a "tunable" way. 
Morphology can be added to the context 
vectors by using the ingenious suggestion of 
Brill to collect high-frequency tri-letter word 
endings (Brill & Marcus, 1992). 
One of the more subtle problems of the 
context specification is that it uses summed 
frequencies, o it may fail to retain important 
correlations. Thus if only AB or CD sequences 
occurred, or only AD or CB sequences, they 
would lead to the same (summed) context 
vector. The only correlations faithfully 
retained are those with the target word. 
Characterizing context n-grams could help 
work around this problem, but is a non-trivial 
task.
