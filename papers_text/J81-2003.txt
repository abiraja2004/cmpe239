This paper shows how the transformational relationship between HAVE-sentences and 
OF=phrases is used to represent data contained in sentences with HAVE as the main verb 
in the context of an information system using natural language to access a relational data 
base. An overview of the system first establishes the framework in which natural language 
processing is done. Then ways of representing HAVE are discussed with emphasis on the 
relation between HAVE and OF. The interpretation proposed and the interpretation 
process are illustrated by a list of representative queries and phrases against a small data 
base. In conclusion, this interpretation is extended to prepositional attributes with WITH 
and WITHOUT,  and problems are discussed. 
1. Introduction 
The User Specialty Languages (USL) System trans- 
lates input in natural language German into expres- 
sions in the formal language of the data base system 
associated with USL, accesses the data base with these 
expressions and  transmits the results to the user either 
directly or after performing additional operations on 
the output. The system was developed at the Heidel- 
berg Scientific Center of IBM Germany by H. Leh- 
mann, N. Ott, the students K. Horl~inder and W. 
Sauermann, and the author. 
USL was designed to provide data base access for 
user groups whose requirements are not satisfied by 
standard programs and for whom having special pro- 
grams written or learning to program themselves would 
not be feasible. 
The system was to be capable of dealing with natu- 
ral language in a variety of different application con- 
texts and not restricted to a particular field or world. 
This purpose determined the methods used and the 
corresponding limitations of the system. Within these 
limits, we have tried in the implementation to incorpo- 
rate the syntactic constructions to be  expected in the 
context of data base interaction and to provide the 
correct interpretations for them. 
The data base management system is an implemen- 
tation of the relational model, the Peterlee Relational 
Test Vehicle (PRTV, Todd, 1975) with its data base 
language ISBL. This is the target language of the 
translation process. The method of translation is a 
substantial extension of the methods used in the REL 
System (Rapidly Extensible Language, Thompson et 
al., 1969, Dostert et al, 1971). This system treats 
natural language much like a formal language in that 
syntactic constructions and function words are inter- 
preted by the system according to the semantics of the 
language built into the system, but nouns, verbs, and 
adjectives are treated as variables of which only the 
data type - -  the word class - -  is known. 
The underlying assumption is the following: The 
meanings of prepositions, dates, verbs like HAVE and 
BE and syntactic constructions, on the one hand, are 
independent of the subject matter; on the other hand, 
nouns, verbs, and adjectives and their meanings vary 
from application to application. In the context of a 
given data base, these words identify the names of 
relations; their meaning is restricted to the association 
between word and corresponding relation. Names and 
numbers identify values within tuples. 
In USL, these words can be added to the system by 
the user to match the shape of the relations in his data 
base. A prompting routine guides the vocabulary defi- 
nition and makes sure that all information needed by 
the system is entered. 
The advantage of not providing the user with the 
vocabulary of his application already built into the 
system is that he is not restricted in his choice of 
words, and new words can be added easily. The dis-

advantage is that the system knows only what has 
been explicitly defined by the user, and common sense 
knowledge, e.g. that an employee is a person or that a 
salary does not own a house, is not reflected in the 
system and is not used in the interpretation process. 
This also means that the interpretation can make only 
very restricted use of deep case relationships, because 
the information on deep cases would have to be ob- 
tained from the user. We see no way as yet to elicit 
this information reliably and consistently, without 
confusing or boring the user. 
When used for an application, then, the system 
works with two vocabularies, one user-defined, con- 
taining the nouns, verbs, and adjectives referring to 
the data base of his application, the other system- 
defined, containing prepositions, quantifiers, interroga- 
tives, particles, names of days and months, nouns ref- 
erring to operations like minimum, maximum, plus, 
minus, etc., the verbs BE and HAVE,  and adjectives 
like GREATER,  MORE,  and LESS. The system- 
defined words and their meanings to the system are 
the same for all applications. 
The purpose of this paper  is to discuss and demon- 
strate the interpretation of one of these system- 
defined words: the verb HAVE when used as the main 
verb of a sentence. (HAVE as an auxiliary has not 
been implemented.) An overview of the system first 
establishes the framework in which this interpretation 
has its place. This is fol lowed by a discussion of 
HAVE in general and possible representations of it in 
USL. The solution proposed here and implemented in 
USL uses the transformational  relationship between 
HAVE-sentences  and OF-phrases to represent and 
search data contained in HAVE-sentences in the rela- 
tion addressed by the accusative of HAVE.  This in- 
terpretation is applied to a list of representative quer- 
ies and phrases against a small data base as a test of 
the interpretation and as an illustration of the interpre- 
tation process. In the concluding sections, the inter- 
pretation is extended to prepositional attributes with 
WITH and WITHOUT,  and problems are discussed. 
2. The System 
This section contains a brief overview of the sys- 
tem. More detail, particularly on the interpretation, is
found in Ott (1977, 1978), and Lehmann (1978). 
Information on language coverage is found in Leh- 
mann et al (1977), and documentation on the gram- 
mar is in preparation. 
The system consists of three parts: 
1. Parser and grammar ules 
2. Function processor and interpretation 
routines 
3. Data base and data base language 
The system contains about 800 syntactic and 200 
lexical (system-defined words) rules. The rules are 
mostly context-free, with some context-sensit ive and 
some transformational  rules, written in a modif ied 
Backus Normal Form (BNF). Each rule contains the 
name of an interpretation routine written in PL /1 ,  
which performs operations in correspondence to the 
meaning of the syntactic construction. 
The parser and function processor are USAGE 
(User Application Generator) ,  developed at the IBM 
Paris Scientific Center, along the principles of Kay 
(1967), with considerable modif ications and exten- 
sions. It works from left to right, bottom-up, through 
the input string. The input is tested against the rules, 
and rules are applied wherever there is a match, lexical 
rules first. The result is several disconnected subtrees, 
which are discarded, and one or more trees spanning 
the entire input. Only the full parses are processed 
further. Each node in the tree contains the name of 
the interpretation routine from the grammar ule used 
in its construction. 
The function processor walks down the tree and 
calls the interpretation routines associated with each 
node. In the original concept developed for REL, the 
interpretation routines were executed on the spot and 
the result was passed as an input parameter to the next 
routine. This procedure proved insufficient for the 
interpretation of quantifiers, negation, and coordinated 
structures. The original concept was changed so that 
now the interpretation routines do not simply pass on 
a result, but successively build a structure reflecting 
semantic dependencies indicated by the syntactic 
structures, the names of the relations, columns and 
values taking part in these dependencies, as well as 
information on syntactic function and scope of individ- 
ual elements in the tree. This structure is processed 
recursively and translated into expressions in the data 
base language ISBL (cf. Ott, 1979, and Lehmann,  
1978, for detail on the interpretation process). 
The resulting ISBL strings are passed to the data- 
base management system to access the data base and 
perform the update or retrieval operations requested. 
In the simple case, if the answer is a list or table of 
items, and the question calls for nothing more, the 
answer is formatted and printed. For yes /no  ques- 
tions, the return code from the data base is translated 
to the proper answer. Questions involving some types 
of quantification and arithmetic need further process- 
ing on the answer. 
The data base is relational. Relations can be 
thought of as tables with rows and columns. Noun, 
verbs, and adjectives refer to relation names; they can 
be words in the language or words invented for a spe- 
cific purpose. Names of columns within relations, 
so-called role names are standardized in USL. They 
correspond to the complements of the nouns, verbs, or 
adjectives. This often coincides with their valence, but 
is not valence in the strict sense, because it does not 
110 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, Apri l - June 1981 
Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System 
matter in USL whether complements are obligatory or 
optional in the language, but only whether these com- 
plements are needed in the application. Thus, a rela- 
tion SUPPLIER can be defined with two, three, or 
more columns, depending on the data and purposes of 
the data base containing it, e.g.: 
supplier of product 
supplier of product o recipient 
supplier of product o recipient at time 
The standard role names are: 
NOM nominative with verbs, with nouns and 
adjectives, set of objects referred to 
ACC accusative 
DAT dative 
GEN genitive 
OF genitive attribute 
LA place 
LO origin 
LG goal 
LD distance 
LP path 
TA point in time, date 
TO start 
TG end 
TD duration 
(preposition) e.g. FUER, name of preposition 
governed 
Thus, a sentence like: 
Joan is the daughter of Harry 
makes the system look for a relation DAUGHTER 
with two columns, NOM and OF, to add the tuple 
Joan, Harry. 
DAUGHTER 
NOM OF 
Joan Harry 
The words IS, THE, and OF, as well as the 
constructions SUBJECT-OF and PREDICATE-  
NOMINAL-OF ,  are understood by the system. 
DAUGHTER is known to be a noun and therefore a 
relation name. JOAN and HARRY are unknown 
strings and therefore assumed to be values in a rela- 
tion. Within this framework, the verb HAVE is one of 
the system-defined words. The following section dis- 
cusses the interpretation of HAVE in the USL system 
and the reasons for this interpretation. 
3. The Interpretation of HAVE 
Compared with the extensive discussion of the verb 
BE, which is accorded special treatment both in lin- 
guistics and logic, the verb HAVE does not seem to 
have appeared in any way problematic. Syntactic pe- 
culiarities have been observed - -  a transitive verb 
which does not readily admit the passive - -  and a 
wide range of meanings are given in any dictionary, 
many of them idiomatic. For sentence analysis within 
a data base context, the major question is that of 
where to store information contained in sentences with 
HAVE as the main verb and from where to retrieve it. 
In the interpretation found in Cresswell (1973) or 
Bennet's (1974) extension of Montague, HAVE ap- 
pears as a two-place predicate. 
This interpretation is also widely accepted in artifi- 
cial intelligence. BUt, as we are going to show, the 
interpretation leads to incorrect results and should be 
abandoned. 
HAVE as a two-place predicate in a relational data 
base would have to be set up as a relation HAVE with 
two columns, one for the subject, one for the objects 
of HAVE-sentences. The tuples of the relation would 
contain the individuals (names, part numbers, figures) 
among which the relation HAVE holds. However, a 
closer look at the contents of such a relation shows 
that two places, one for the subject and one for the 
object, are not enough. Given the facts that: 
John has a secretary by the name of Pauline 
John has a daughter named Polly, who is a 
secretary 
The corresponding data base entries in the relations 
HAVE, DAUGHTER,  and SECRETARY would read: 
HAVE DAUGHTER SECRETARY 
NOM ACC NOM OF NOM OF 
John Polly Polly John Polly Bill 
John Pauline Pauline John 
From this would follow correctly that " John has 
(daughter) Polly" and "John has (secretary) Pauline" 
but also that "John has two secretaries", because both 
Polly and Pauline are secretaries. The relationship 
between elements expressed as "x has y" is too vague; 
it can apply in too many cases, and can often be re- 
versed "if x has (daughter) y, then y has (parent) x"; 
so that at least the specific relationship that makes it 
possible to speak of x having y would have to be re- 
corded in a third column: "x has y as z". In that case, 
the examples above would not lead to John's having 
two secretaries: 
HAVE 
NOM ACC AS 
John Pauline secretary 
John Polly daughter 
What is written in the third column sometimes ap- 
pears overtly in sentences, but it is not part of the 
valence of HAVE, so that it would be difficult to re- 
quire HAVE to be used only with reference to the 
relationship in the third column. Furthermore, the fact 
that the items in the third column are names of rela- 
tionships and not names of individuals is significant in 
itself. This leads to the conclusion that HAVE should 
not be regarded as a primitive predicate at all, but as a 
derived predicate, derivable just in case some other

Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System 
relationship exists between the individuals in question. 
With different aims and from a different point of 
view, this has already been observed by Bach 
(1967:476-77): 
It has often been said that be has no meaning by 
itself but only in connection with Predicate, the 
passive construction, and so on. The same is true 
of have. The two forms are distinguished syntac- 
tically from most true verbs by the fact that they 
have no selectional restrictions in themselves, but 
occur in constructions where the selections reach 
across from "subject" to "object" or complement. 
Likewise, from a semantic point of view, their 
contribution tO the meaning of the sentence is 
determined completely by the items that they link. 
Conversely, HAVE can only be used meaningfully 
to link elements where some other relationship deter- 
mining the nature of that link is expressed or can be 
inferred. The vague term "some other relationship" 
needs more clarification than can be given at this time. 
It is clear that the relationship must be representable 
as a two-place predicate, but many such predicates do 
not serve as the basis for deriving HAVE. It seems, 
for instance, that the relations expressed by action 
verbs do not permit HAVE to be derived directly, 
though their agent nominalizations often do: 
John teaches Jack 
? # John has Jack # Jack has John 
John is the teacher of Jack 
= Jack has John as his teacher 
The relationships most often associated with HAVE 
are those of possession and ownership. That the 
meaning of HAVE is much wider is commonplace. (A 
detailed analysis of the syntactic properties of HAVE 
and their association with different meanings is found 
in Pitha 1971 and 1972). Still, the verbs OWN and 
POSSESS can be replaced by HAVE without interven- 
ing nominalization and the extension of 
John has a bicycle 
from 
John owns a bicycle 
to 
John has a bicycle in his possession 
seems artificial. On the other hand, the conclusion: 
If John has a bicycle, then he owns a bicycle 
is plausible and often true, but not necessarily so, and 
will be false with different choices of objects. In the 
case of inalienable possession as the objects of HAVE 
sentences, the conclusion is absurd, so that the objects 
of HAVE and OWN are taken to refer to different 
entities (Bierwisch, 1965). Nevertheless, while it is 
clearly impossible to restrict the interpretation of 
HAVE to possession, any other interpretation will face 
the problem that HAVE is often used as a synonym of 
OWN or POSSESS (cf. section 6). This may be the 
reason why HAVE is often regarded as a primitive for 
possession (e.g. Langacker, 1975). There is a trans- 
formational relationship between HAVE and OF, al- 
ready discussed e.g. in Bach (1967): 
Peter has a daughter Joan 
Joan is the daughter of Peter 
But there is a peculiarity: Whereas HAVE can be used 
with names, as well as with names and common nouns, 
whereby a relationship is implied if if is not overtly 
expressed (e.g., We each have our own room, I have 
A101), OF is rarely used only with names: 
Peter has A202 
?(The) A202 of Peter 
but 
Peter has a room 
The room of Peter 
This seems to show that, unlike HAVE-sentences, 
OF-phrases are acceptable only where the relationship 
between individuals is not implied but overtly stated. 
There is no base relationship underlying the use of 
OF, the base relationship is the one preceding OF in 
the OF-phrase. Furthermore, OF-phrases seem to be 
the specific means to express such relationships. The 
"secretary of Peter" is the individual which is related 
to Peter via the relationship "secretary of". OF- 
phrases cannot be expanded in the same way as 
HAVE-sentences can be expanded by AS- 
complements to introduce the "real" base relationship. 
And, because the base relationship is overtly stated, 
OF-phrases cannot be reversed: 
?(The) Peter of the secretary 
In this sense, OF-phrases can be considered as being 
more explicit than the HAVE-sentences into which 
they can be transformed. 
This led to the decision to interpret HAVE sen- 
tences in USL as transformations of OF-phrases and 
consequently to search or store information in HAVE-  
sentences not in a relation representing the verb, but 
in the columns with the role-name OF in relations 
addressed by the nouns in the sentence. 
The following uses of OF are not transformational- 
ly related to HAVE and are excluded here: 
Helen of Troy 
piece of chalk 
distance of 3 miles 
love of God 
angel of a nurse 
the destruction of the city 
basket (full/out) of wood 
man of property 
For the purposes of data base query, some of these 
constructions with OF do not seem to be necessary. 
Measure expressions are desirable, but have not been 
implemented. An unsolved problem is how OF- 
phrases resulting from nominalizations of verbs can be 
related within the USL framework in a general way to 
112 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 
Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System 
the verb or to the event  referred to. The remain ing 
uses of OF  have a range of meaning similar to HAVE 
in express ing not only possess ion and par t -o f  re lat ion-  
ships, but  also any number  of o ther  re lat ionsh ips  
which, in the case of OF ,  are expl ic i t ly named by the 
noun preceding OF  and, in the case of HAVE,  can be 
inferred from the nouns or occur expl ic i t ly in the AS-  
complement .  
Al l  uses where OF  is re lated to HAVE,  as well  as 
some of the other  uses, can in German also be ex- 
pressed by genit ive attr ibutes (not  all are poss ib le in 
Engl ish because of the restr icted use of the genit ive).  
The uses re lated to HAVE also appear  as possessive 
pronouns.  Geni t ive  attr ibutes,  as well  as possessive 
pronouns ,  are in terpreted  in the same way as OF-  
phrases.  An  addit ional  select ion operat ion  for posses-  
sive pronouns is necessary to obta in  a match between 
the indiv idual  members  of the sets referred to by the 
possess ive and addressed  by the head noun of the 
possessive. 
If the t rans format iona l  re lat ionsh ip  between 
HAVE-sentences  and OF-phrases  is to be used, and 
HAVE-sentences  access the OF-co lumn of re lat ions  
(the column with the role name OF) ,  there are still 
two possibi l i t ies:  G iven the sentence:  
Which manager  has a secretary? 
a f irst in terpretat ion  addresses  the OF-co lumn of 
MANAGER and compares  the contents  of that  col-  
umn with the list of secretar ies:  "Is there a manager  of 
somebody,  is that  somebody a secretary ,  and if so, 
who is the manager  ' 
The set of x, such that x is a manager of y 
and y is a secretary: 
{x\[ Ey(M(x,y) A S(y))} 
This in terpretat ion  is val id only where secretar ies are 
managed by the people whose secretary  they are, but  
fails for: 
Which manager  has room 35? 
unless the room of the manager  is also conta ined in 
the OF-co lumn of MANAGER.  In general ,  this inter-  
pretat ion  will work  only where everyth ing a manager  
can have is conta ined in the OF-co lumn of MANAG-  
ER and is therefore  not  useful  as a general  solut ion. 
Fur thermore ,  the interpretat ion  is unable to handle 
correct ly  sentences like: 
Which manager  has a music ian as his secretary?  
Which manager  has a secretary  as his music ian? 1 
It assigns the fo l lowing in terpretat ion  to both  sen-  
tences: 
{xlEy(M(x,y)  A S(y) A Mu(y))} 
though their  meaning is c lear ly di f ferent.  
1 The possessive pronoun here and in the examples below 
makes for better eading of the English glosses, the German exam- 
ples do not have it and it is not necessary for the discussion. 
A second in terpretat ion  of the sentence below: 
Which  manager  has a secretary?  
searches in the OF-co lumn of the accusat ive,  SECRE-  
TARY,  for an entry  that is also l isted in MANAGER:  
"Is there a secretary  of somebody,  is that  somebody a 
manager ,  and if so, who is i t" :  
The set of x such that there is a y who is 
a secretary and y is secretary of x and x is 
a manager: 
{xlEy(S(y,x) A M(x))} 
Accord ing ly :  
Which manager  has room 35? 
The set of x such that the room of x is 35 
and x is a manager: 
{xl A(x,35) A M(x)} 
The second so lut ion does not  requi re  that  every-  
thing a manager  can have is found in the OF-co lumn 
of manager .  The se lect ion starts  with the re la t ion  
named by the direct  ob ject  of HAVE.  In this way it is 
also guaranteed  that  the re la t ion  spec i f ied actual ly  
obta ins  between the respect ive  indiv iduals .  In the 
example:  
Which manager  has a secretary?  
the secretary  requested is not  just any secretary,  but  
the secretary  of this manager ,  not  perhaps a col league 
of this manager  and the secretary  of another .  
This in terpretat ion  also d is t inguishes between the 
two sentences  with AS-complements ,  whereby  the 
complement  akes the place of the accusat ive and the 
accusat ive is t reated as an appos i t ion  to it. 
Which manager  has a music ian as his secretary? 
The set of x such that y is secretary of x 
and y is a musician and x is a manager: 
{xlEy(S(y,x) A M(x) A Mu(y))} 
Which manager  has a secretary  as his music ian? 
The set of x such that y is musician of x 
and y is a secretary and x is a manager: 
{xlEy(Mu(y,x)  A M(x) A S(y))} 
The first solut ion could be used as an escape if the 
other  in terpretat ion  does not  yield a result,  but  it leads 
to mult ip le  in terpretat ions  with the same result  for 
re lat ions that are def ined as converses  of one another.  
In o ther  cases, this in terpretat ion  leads to.  answers  
where the answer should be undef ined:  
Which  manager  has 5000? 
(salary,  personnel ,  or what)  
Which manager  has A202?  
(room, car, personnel  number)  
As a result,  the second in terpretat ion  has been imple-  
mented  in its str ict form: There is genera l ly  no answer  
def ined for queries in which the ob ject  of HAVE does 
not conta in  a relat ion.  In human dia logue,  such ques-  
t ions can of ten be answered  because either it is c lear 
that  HAVE means  POSSESS or BE PART OF ,  or

4. Test  of the Interpretat ion 
In order to see whether relating the subject of 
HAVE to the OF-column of the accusative of HAVE 
is a correct and general solution to the problem of 
interpreting HAVE,  this interpretation was tried out 
with sentences containing HAVE and six types of 
noun phrases relevant in USL: names, quantified com- 
mon nouns, common nouns preceded by interrogatives, 
relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and noun 
phrases with apposition, all both in subject and object 
positions. Coordinated noun phrases were not tested 
separately, because they are expanded into as many 
separate sentences as there are noun phrases in the 
coordination. Similarly, where there is no negation, 
common nouns preceded by quantifier or preceded by 
interrogative do not require different interpretations 
with respect to HAVE.  Quantif iers trigger several 
transformation operations on the ISBL-string resulting 
from the translation (Ott, 1977), but the translation is 
the same. Interrogatives indicate which columns of 
the result are to figure in the answer. Appositions of 
the type "secretary Moser" ,  "Moser as secretary" 
(including AS-complements of HAVE)  have been in- 
eluded, because the first type furnishes a selection 
from the relation addressed, and the second type the 
relation itself. 
The relevant features then are: name, noun, inter- 
rogative, referent of relative pronoun, and negation. 
The following section lists the test phrases for these 
cases, but not all their permutations. Also, appositions 
are not shown for relative clauses, for the sake of 
brevity. The list illustrates how the interpretation of 
HAVE outlined here is implemented in USL. For  
each case, the general ISBL expression which results 
f rom the interpretation of HAVE is formed. Then 
examples are formulated against a sample data base 
and translated into ISBL expressions according to the 
general schema, and the results of the data base opera- 
tions triggered by the ISBL expression are shown, 
together with the columns taking part in the selection 
operations. The examples have been left in German, 
with glosses in English, because some of the construc- 
tions tested cannot be formulated in English in the 
same way. 
The sample data base contains the following rela-

those relations where the noun phrases contain inter- 
rogatives." In terms of a question against the sample 
data base this means: 
Which manager has which secretary? 
NOM, the relation in the nominative, is MA for MAN-  
AGER,  ACC is SECRETARY:  MAxSEK. NOMnom 
is the NOM-co lumn of MANAGER,  OFace is the 
OF-column of SECRETARY,  the relation in the accu- 
sative: NOMma=OFsek .  Both nominative and accu- 
sative noun phrases contain interrogatives. Therefore 
the NOM-columns of both  must be projected for out- 
put: ?/bNOMma,NOMsek.

searched in the data base,  and the answer  depends  on 
whether  the result  is an empty  set. So, "does: Moser  
have no manager"  is in terpreted as " f ind the manager

The relation in the apposition takes the place of the 
relation in the accusative in the scheme for A. l .a.  If 
one of the two relations is in the nominative, and the 
other in the apposition to the accusative, the formula- 
tion "whom as" is equivalent o "which". 
Which manager has whom as a secretary? 
is equivalent o 
Which manager has which secretary? 
If the question begins with the accusative, there are 
two readings: one placing the apposition with the pre- 
ceding nominative, and a second reading which places 
it with the accusative. This second reading is the pre- 
ferred reading. Therefore, the examples 
Welcher Manager hat wen als Sekret~irin? 
Which manager has whom as his secretary? 
Wen hat welcher Manager als Sekret~irin?

are all translated like:

be answered. The second, preferred, reading of the 
sentence places the apposition with the accusative:

is translated like the previous example, though with 
different relations.

The general schema would look like: 
(NOMwh-(ACC;OFacc) %NOMacc) 
But since the interrogative pronoun does not contain a 
relation, there is no set to subtract from. These ques- 
tions cannot be answered in USL, because the set 
often implied by the context or the meaning of words 
is not known. The set is given by formulations like 
"which x does not have y".

These examples can be interpreted as "who of the 
people having secretaries have a secretary other than 
Moser".  This interpretation is not implemented, be- 
cause for the majority of negated questions containing 
interrogative pronouns, there is no interpretation in 
USL. So the exceptions are not interpreted either, to 
avoid confusion.

5. WITH and WITHOUT 
Prepositional phrases containing WITH and WITH- 
OUT can also be related to OF-phrases (Lees 
1960:93) and to HAVE (Poldauf I967:33f.) ,  unless 
the prepositions are governed by the verb or are part 
of instrumental, comitative, or adverbial phrases. 
Where WITH-phrases are defined as prepositional 
complements of nouns, verbs or adjectives, they are 
related to the corresponding WITH-column in the 
corresponding relation. WITHOUT should then be 
treated as "not with", but this is not implemented. 
Phrases containing WITH and WITHOUT that are not 
complements are interpreted in tile following manner: 
The NOM-column of the relation addressed by the 
noun governing the prepositional phrase is related to 
the OF-column of the relation addressed by the prepo- 
sitional phrase. As a result, except for the columns, for 
projection and subtraction, the following groups of 
phrases each have the same transIation: 
(SEK;OFsek=x) 
secretary of x 
x has secretary 
x with secretary 
x's secretary 
NOT(SEK;.OFsek=x) 
not secretary of x 
x has no secretary 
x without secretary 
not x's secretary 
( (MAxSEK) ;NOMma=OFsek)  
secretary of manager 
manager has secretary 
manager with secretary 
manager's secretary 
NOT((MAxSEK) ;NOMma=OFsek)  
not secretary of manager 
manager has no secretary 
manager without secretary 
not manager's secretary 
6. Problems 
In conclusion, some of the problems of this inter- 
pretation must be pointed out. If there are relations 
POSSESS or OWN in the data base, HAVE sentences 
could be meant to refer to these relations. But there 
is no mechanism that automatically would look for 
such relations and either access them directly or resort 
to them if the standard interpretation fails. A solution 
to this problem is for the user to define HAVE as a 
synonym for POSSESS. He can then delete the 
system-defined HAVE altogether, if he is sure to use 
HAVE only in the sense of OWN. But he will proba- 
bly want his definition in addition to the system de- 
fined HAVE. This leads to two parses and interpreta- 
tions. In many cases only one of them will bring re- 
suits, but sometimes both lead to the same answer. 
Thus, 
Does John have a secretary? 
will be interpreted both as: 
Is there a secretary of John? 
and 
Does John own a secretary? 
where the second interpretation will fail. But the 
query 
Does John have a car? 
can bring answers to both interpretations, depending 
on the structure of the data base. 
A consequence of not having a relation HAVE on 
the one hand and on the other of expecting alt adver- 
bials and prepositional phrases to refer to columns in 
relations causes difficulties where prepositions are 
used in conjunction with HAVE and also with BE, as 
in questions like: 
Where does Peter have his office? 
To whom is Peter married? 
When is Peter's birthday? 
Is Peter's birthday on Friday? 
The German equivalent of the last two questions uses 
the verb HAVE:  
Wann hat Peter Geburtstag? 
Hat Peter am Freitag Geburtstag? 
For sentences with HAVE and BE as the main 
verb, the adverbials and prepositional phrases which 
have been attached to the verb by the grammar are 
relocated to the noun phrase addressing the relation 
that contains the corresponding columns. For the 
examples above, this means the columns LA, P=to ,  
and TA, respectively, in the relations OFF ICE,  
BIRTHDAY, and MARRIED.  
A serious problem for which we currently have no 
solution results from the fact that there is no interpre- 
tation where the accusative does not contain a rela- 
tion. As can be seen from the examples, it is often 
intuitively clear what the interpretation of such sen- 
118 American Journal of  Computat iona l  Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, Apr i l - June 1981 
Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System 
tences could be. "The secretary who has Sauer" could 
easily be the secretary of Sauer in the context of "who 
has whom to work for", but in the context of "who 
has which manager",  the "secretary who has Sauer" 
can be the one whose manager is Sauer. As was 
shown above, the predicate HAVE is a derived predi- 
cate, it is applicable only where a more basic associa- 
tion exists between the elements in question. This 
predicate is found explicitly expressed, where HAVE 
sentences are expanded by AS-complements. 
Peter has a musician as secretary 
If there is no AS-complement and the accusative of 
HAVE contains a common noun, that noun generally 
points to the predicate; the AS-complement would be 
redundant. 
Peter has a musician 
can be read as 
Peter has a musician as his musician 
But in the proper context, the base predicate can be 
clearly something else: In a conversation about hob- 
bies of secretaries, the same sentence "Peter has a 
musician" can mean 
Peter has a musician as his secretary 
In human dialogue the general rule that the base 
predicate appears in the accusative noun phrase can be 
overridden by special contexts, but in the general case 
the rule holds and can be used in the framework of 
data base interaction. In the absence of reference to a 
predicate in the accusative of HAVE,  the base predi- 
cate can only be deduced from the context. It can be 
one of the properties of the element in the accusative, 
e.g. Sauer's being a manager, a father, or an employer, 
or it can coincide with the predicate referred to by the 
nominative. Therefore, the attempt at interpretation 
of such sentences would lead to choosing among plau- 
sible alternatives, choices that would remain arbitrary 
even if carefully made, and the results would be unre- 
liable. We have avoided this at the cost of not provid- 
ing general interpretations for these cases, even though 
the individual case is often intuitively interpretable, 
because we feel that in the framework of data base 
interaction it is more important for the system to react 
consistently and reliably than to simulate human dia- 
logue. 
Since this paper was originally written, the USL 
System has moved to using System R as the data base 
management system, with SQL as the query language 
and target language for the interpretation. The 
PRTV-version of USL has been used by small groups 
in their applications, and initial results are encouraging 
(Lehmann et al, 1978, Krause, 1979). Further study 
is necessary, particularly with respect to data-base 
design and vocabulary definition by users.
