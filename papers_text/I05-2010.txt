Abstract 
This paper describes a mix word-pair 
mix-WP) identifier to resolve homo-
nym/segmentation ambiguities as well 
as perform STW conversion effec-
tively for Chinese input. The mix-WP 
identifier includes a specific word-pair 
(SWP) identifier and a common word-
pair (CWP) identifier. It is designed as 
a supporting processing with Chinese 
input systems. Our experiments show 
that by applying the mix-WP identifier, 
together with the Microsoft input 
method editor 2003 (MSIME) and an 
optimized bigram model (BiGram), 
the tonal and toneless STW perform-
ance of the two input systems can be 
improved. 
1 Introduction 
Currently, the most popular method for Chinese 
input is phonetic and pinyin based, because Chi-
nese people are taught to write the correspond-
ing phonetic and pinyin syllables of each 
Chinese character and word in primary school. 
In Chinese, each Chinese character corresponds 
to at least one syllable; and each Chinese word 
can be a mono-syllabic word, such as ??
(mouse)?, a bi-syllabic word, such as ???
(kangaroo)?, or a multi-syllabic word, such as 
????(Mickey mouse).? Although there are 
more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of 
which 5,400 are commonly used), there are only 
about 1,300 distinct syllables. Since the size of 
problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) con-
version is much less than that of syllable-to-
character (STC) conversion, the most existing 
Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al 
1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002, 
MSIME) are addressed on STW conversion.  
Conventionally, there are two approaches for 
STW conversion: (1) the linguistic approach 
based on syntax parsing, semantic template 
matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, 
Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai 
and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach 
based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 
or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al 
1996, Ho et al 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al 
2002, Lee 2003). Although the linguistic ap-
proach requires considerable effort in designing 
effective syntax rules, semantic templates or 
contextual information, it is more user-friendly 
than the statistical approach on understanding 
why such a system makes a mistake (Hsu 1994, 
Tsai and Hsu 2002). On the other hand, the sta-
tistical language model (SLM) used in the statis-
tical approach requires less effort and has been 
widely adopted in commercial Chinese input 
systems (Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003). 
According to (Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai 
and Hsu 2002), homophone selection and sylla-
ble-word segmentation are two critical problems 
to the STW conversion in Chinese. Incorrect 
homophone selection and failed syllable-word 
segmentation will directly influence the STW 
conversion rate. The goal of this study is to il-
lustrate the effectiveness of specific word-pairs 
and common word-pairs for resolving homo-
nym/segmentation ambiguities to perform STW 
conversion in Chinese. In this paper, we use to-
nal to indicate the syllables with four tones, such 
as ?ji4(?)shu4(?)? and toneless to indicate the 
syllables without four tones, such as ?ji(? ) 
shu(?).?

The remainder of this paper is arranged as 
follows. In Section 2, we firstly propose the 
method for auto-generating the specific word-
pairs and the common word-pairs from given 
Chinese sentences. Then, we develop a mix 
word-pair (mix-WP) identifier includes a spe-
cific word-pair identifier and a common word-
pair identifier. The mix-WP identifier is based 
on pre-collected datasets of specific and com-
mon word-pairs. In Section 3, we present our 
STW experiment results. Finally, in Section 4, 
we give our conclusions and suggest some fu-
ture research directions. 
2 Development of Mix-WP Identifier 
In this study, a mix word-pair identifier includes 
a specific word-pair (SWP) identifier and a 
common word-pair (CWP) identifier. The sys-
tem dictionary of the mix-WP identifier is com-
prised of the CKIP lexicon (CKIP, 1995) and 
those unknown words found automatically from 
the UDN 2001 corpus by a Chinese word auto-
confirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al 2003). 
The pinyin syllable-words were translated by 
phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as ???
??-to-?ji4.? 
2.1 Development of SWP Identifier 
2.1.1 Auto-Generate SWP Data.  
The steps of auto-generating specific word-pair 
(AUTO-SWP) for a given Chinese sentence: 
Step 1. Generate the segmentation for the given 
Chinese sentence with a backward maximum 
matching (BMM) technique. As pre (Tsai et al 
2004), the performance of BMM is better than 
that of forward maximum matching. 
Step 2. Extract the BEGIN, END and BOUND 
word-pairs from the BMM segmentation of 
Step 1 by following processes, respectively:  
(1) BEGIN word-pair. When the word number 
of segmentation is greater than 1, the first two 
words will be comprised as a BEGIN word-
pair. For the segmentation ????(concert)?
? (locale) ? ? (enter) ? ? (many) ? ?
(audience members),? the ????-??? will 
be generated as a BEGIN word-pair. 
(2) END word-pair. When the word number of 
segmentation is greater than 2, the last two 
words will be comprised as an END word-pair. 
For the segmentation ??? (whole)??
(construction)?? (prearrange)?? (end of 
year)??(complete),? the ???-??? will 
be generated as an END word-pair. 
(3) BOUND word-pair. When the word num-
ber of segmentation is greater than 2, the first 
word and the last word will be comprised as a 
BOUND word-pair. For the segmentation ??
?(price)??(ordinarily)??(maintain)??
(stable),? the ???-??? will be generated as 
a BOUND word-pair. 
Step 3. If the generated SWP was not found in 
its corresponding datasets, insert the generated 
SWP into the BEGIN, END and BOUND 
word-pair datasets, respectively. 
2.1.2 SWP Identifier.  
In Figure 1, the SWP data is a collection of auto-
generated BEGIN, END and BOUND SWP 
datasets. If a SWP identifier only uses one of the 
BEGIN, END or BOUND SWP dataset, it will 
naturally become a BEGIN(BN), END(ED) or 
BOUND(BD) SWP identifier. The algorithm of 
our SWP identifier is as follows: 
Specific word-pair 
(SWP) identifier

Fig. 1. A system overview of the SWP identifier 
Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables. 
Step 2. Generate all found BN, ED and BD 
SWP in the input syllables to be the initial 
SWP set. if the initial SWP set, if the found 
SWP number of the word-syllable pair of a 
BN, ED or BD SWP is greater than one in the 
BN, ED or BD datasets, respectively, the SWP 
will be dropped from the initial SWP set. 
Step 3. Use the longest syllabic word-pair first 
(LS-WPF) strategy (Tsai and Hsu. 2002) to se-
lect the BN, ED and BD word-pair from the 
initial SWP set into the final SWP set. 
Step 4. Replace corresponding syllable-word 
pair of the input syllables with the word-pairs 
of the final SWP set to be a SWP-sentence. As 
per our experiment, the performance of the 
three SWP identifiers is BD < BN < ED. Thus, 
the identifying sequence of our SWP identifier 
is from BD, BN to ED. 
Table 1 is a step by step example that illustrates 
the four steps of our SWP identifier for the Chi-
56
nese syllables ?shu3 dou1 shu3 bu4 qing1 (?
[count]?[always]???[innumerable])).? Note 
that when we used the Microsoft Input Method 
Editor 2003 for Traditional Chinese, a trigram-
like input system (MSIME), to convert the same 
syllables, the output was ??(belong)?(always)
?(mouse)?(not)?(clear).?

Step.3 The selected specific word-pairs: 
 ?(shu3)-?(dou1)/BEGIN pair 
 ?(dou1)-???(shu3)/END pair 
Step.4 SWP-sentence: 
 ? ? shu3 bu4 qing1 
 (?shu3 dou1? replace with the BEGIN pair of Step 3) 
  ? ? ? ? ?  
 (?shu3 bu4 qing1? replace with the END pair of Step 3) 
2.2 Development of CWP Identifier 
2.2.1 Auto-Generate CWP Data 
The steps of auto-generating common word-pair 
(AUTO-CWP) for a given Chinese sentence: 
Step 1. Generate the word segmentation for the 
given Chinese sentence by BMM technique. 
Step 2. Extract all the combinations of word-
pairs from the BMM segmentation of Step 1 to 
be the initial CWP set. For the segmentation 
??/??/??,? three CWP will be extracted, 
i.e. ??-???, ??-??? and ???-??.? 
Step 3. Select the word-pairs comprised of two 
multi-syllabic Chinese words (such as ???
(can not)?) to be the finial CWP set. For the 
final CWP set, if the word-pair is not found in 
the CWP database, insert it into the CWP da-
tabase and set its frequency to 1; otherwise, 
increase its frequency by 1. In the above case, 
the final CWP set includes one word-pair, i.e. 
???-??.?  
2.2.2 CWP Identifier 
The system overview of the CWP identifier is 
same with that of the SWP identifier as shown 
in Fig. 1. The algorithm of our CWP identifier 
is as follows: 
Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables. 
Step 2. Generate all possible word-pairs com-
prised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words for 
the input syllables to be the input of Step 3. 
Step 3. Select out the word-pairs that match a 
word-pair in the CWP database to be the ini-
tial CWP set, firstly. Then, from the initial 
CWP set, select the word-pair with maximum 
frequency as the key word-pair. Finally, find 
the co-occurrence word-pairs with the key 
word-pair in the training corpus to be the final 
CWP set. If there are two or more word-pairs 
with the same maximum frequency, one of 
them is randomly selected as the key word-
pair. 
Step 4. Arrange all word-pairs of the final CWP 
set into a CWP-sentence. If no word-pairs can 
be identified in the input syllables, a NULL 
CWP-sentence is produced. 
If applying the CWP identifier on the syllables 
?yi1 ge5 wen2 ming2 de5 shuai1 wei2 guo4 
cheng2(?? [a]?? [civilization]? [of]??
[decay]?? [process]),? the generated WP-
sentence will be ????? de5shuai1wei2 ?
? .? For the same syllables, the MSIME will 
convert them into ???[a]??[famous]?[of]
??[decay]??[process].? The detailed analy-
sis and demonstration of our CWP identifier can 
be found in (Tsai 2005). Appendix A presents a 
case of the CWP identified results. 
3 The STW Experiments 
To evaluate the STW performance of our mix-
WP identifier, the STW accuracy, the identified 
character ratio (ICR) and the STW improvement 
were used (Tsai 2005). 
3.1 Experimental Data 
To conduct the STW experiments, firstly, use 
the inverse translator of phoneme-to-character 
(PTC) provided in GOING system to convert 
testing sentences into their corresponding sylla-
bles. All the error PTC translations of GOING 
were corrected by post human-editing. We, then, 
apply our SWP, CWP and mix-WP identifier to 
convert the syllable sequence back to words and 
calculate its STW accuracy and identified char-
acter ratio. All test sentences are composed of a 
string of Chinese characters. 
In following experiments, the training and 
testing corpus, closed/open test sets and the col-
lection of the testing SWP and CWP data were: 
57
Training corpus: The UDN 2001 corpus was 
selected as our training corpus. It is a collection 
of 4,539,624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 
2001 articles on the United Daily News Website 
(UDN) in Taiwan. 
Testing corpus: The UDN 2002 corpus was 
selected as our testing corpus. It is a collection 
of 3,321,504 Chinese sentences that were ex-
tracted from whole 2002 articles on (UDN).  
Closed testing set: 10,000 sentences were ran-
domly selected from the UDN 2001 corpus as 
the closed testing set. 
Open testing set: 10,000 sentences were ran-
domly selected from the UDN 2002 corpus as 
the open testing set. At this point, we checked 
that the selected open testing sentences were not 
in the closed testing set as well. 
Testing SWP data: By applying our AUTO-
SWP on the UDN 2001 corpus, we created 
1,754,055 BN, 1,594,036 ED and 2,502,241 BD 
specific word-pairs. 
Testing CWP data: By applying our AUTO-
CWP on the UDN 2001 corpus, we created 
25,439,679 common word-pairs. 
In this study, we conducted the STW experiment 
in a progressive manner. The experimental re-
sults of the SWP, CWP and mix-WP identifiers 
are described in Sub-sections 3.2, 3.3.and 3.4, 
respectively. 
3.2 Experiment of SWP Identifier 
This experiment is to demonstrate the tonal and 
toneless STW accuracies by using the SWP 
identifier with the testing BN, ED, BD and ALL 
datasets, respectively. Note that the symbol 
ALL stands for a mixed collection of all BN, 
ED and BD word-pairs generated from the 
UDN 2001 corpus.

ments for the SWP identifier with BN, ED, BD and

Table 2 shows the average tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of the SWP identifier with ALL 
SWP data for the closed and open test sets are 
99.4% and 97.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, be-
tween the closed and open test sets, the differ-
ences of tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 
the SWP identifier are 0.5% and 2%, respectively.  
3.3 Experiment of CWP Identifier 
This experiment is to demonstrate the tonal and 
toneless STW accuracies among the identified 
word-pairs by using the CWP identifier with the 
testing CWP data. 
Table 3. The results of the tonal and toneless STW 
experiment for the CWP identifier

Tonal     99.1  98.4          98.8 (61.9) 
Toneless    94.1  90.9          92.6 (58.6) 
 
Table 3 shows the average tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of the CWP identifier for closed 
and open test sets are 98.8% and 92.6%, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, between the closed and open 
test sets, the differences of tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of the CWP identifier are 0.7% 
and 3.2%, respectively. 
3.4 Experiment of Mix-WP Identifier 
This experiment is to demonstrate the tonal and 
toneless STW accuracies among the identified 
word-pairs by using the mix-WP identifier with 
all testing WP data. From Tables 2 and 3, the 
STW performance of the SWP identifier is bet-
ter than that of the CWP identifier. Therefore, 
our mix-WP identifier uses the CWP identifier 
to identify CWP first and the SWP identifier to 
identifier SWP last for a given syllables. 
Table 4. The results of tonal and toneless STW ex-
periments for the mix-WP identifier 
   Closed Open Average (ICR) 
Tonal     99.2  98.4      98.8 (67.6) 
Toneless    94.9  91.8      93.5 (64.6) 
 
Table 4 shows the average tonal and toneless 
STW accuracies of the mix-WP identifier for 
closed and open test sets are 98.8% and 93.5%, 
respectively. Meanwhile, between the closed 
and open test sets, the differences of to-
nal/toneless STW accuracies of the mix-WP 
identifier are 0.8% and 3.1%, respectively. The 
average identified character ratio (ICR) of the 
tonal and the toneless syllables are 67.6% and 
64.6%, respectively. To sum up the results of 
Tables 2 to 4, we conclude that the mix-WP 
(SWP and CWP) data can be used to effectively 
convert Chinese STW on the mix-WP-related 
58
portion (including the SWP-related portion and 
the CWP-related portion, respectively). 
3.5 Commercial IME System and Bigram 
Model with WP Identifier 
We selected Microsoft Input Method Editor 
2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) as our 
experimental commercial Chinese input system. 
In addition, an optimized bigram model called 
BiGram was developed (Tsai et al 2004). The 
BiGram STW system is a bigram-based model 
developing by SRILM (Stolcke 2002) with 
Good-Turing back-off smoothing (Manning and 
Schuetze, 1999), as well as forward and back-
ward LS-WPF strategies (Chen et al 1986, Tsai 
et al 2004). The training corpus and the system 
dictionary of this BiGram system are same with 
that of the mix-WP identifier. In this experi-
ment, the STW output of the MSIME with the 
mix-WP identifier, or the BiGram with the mix-
WP identifier, was collected by directly replac-
ing the identified word-pairs from the corre-
sponding STW output of MSIME or BiGram. 
 
Table 5. The results of tonal and toneless STW ex-
periment for the MSIME and the MSIME with the 
mix-WP identifier 
MSIME      MSIME+WP a     Improvement

mix-WP identifier

experiment for the BiGram and the BiGram with the

Toneless    85.2% 88.1%  19.6%  
a STW accuracies of the words identified by the BiGram with the 
mix-WP identifier 
 
From Table 5, the tonal and toneless STW 
improvements of the MSIME by using the mix-
WP identifier are 29.2% and 22.5%, respec-
tively. On the other hand, from Table 6, the to-
nal and toneless STW improvements of the 
BiGram by using the mix-WP identifier are 
12.8% and 19.6%, respectively. To sum up the 
results of this experiment, we conclude that the 
mix-WP identifier can achieve better WP-
portion STW accuracy than that of the MSIME 
and BiGram Chinese input systems. 
4 Conclusion and Future Directions 
In this paper, we have applied a mix-WP identi-
fier to the Chinese STW conversion and ob-
tained a high STW accuracy on the identified 
word-pairs with ICR of more than 60%. All of 
the testing mix-WP data was auto-generated by 
using the AUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP on 
the training corpus. We are encouraged by the 
fact that mix-WP knowledge can achieve tonal 
and toneless STW accuracies of 98.8% and 
93.5%, respectively, for the mix-WP-related 
portion of the testing syllables. The mix-WP 
identifier can be easily integrated into existing 
Chinese input systems or Chinese language 
processing of typical speech recognition sys-
tems by identifying word-pairs in a post-
processing step. Our experimental results show 
that, by applying the mix-WP identifier together 
with the MSIME and the BiGram input systems, 
the tonal and toneless STW improvements are 
29%/23% and 13%/20%, respectively. To the 
adaptive approach, we also tried to use the 
AUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP to auto-
extract new SWP and CWP from the open test 
sentences into the mix-WP data, firstly. Then, 
we found the overall tonal and toneless STW 
accuracies of the MSIME and the BiGram for 
closed/open syllables become 96.5%/90% and 
97.1%/89%, respectively. 
Currently, our approach is quite basic when 
more than one SWP or CWP occurs in the same 
sentence. Although there is room for improve-
ment, we believe it would not produce a notice-
able effect as far as the STW accuracy is 
concerned. However, this issue will become 
important as we apply the mix-WP knowledge 
to speech recognition. According to our compu-
tations, the collection of our mix-WP knowl-
edge can cover approximately 70% and 60% of 
the characters in the UDN 2001 and 2002 cor-
pus, respectively. 
We will continue to expand our collection of 
mix-WP knowledge with Web corpus. In other 
directions, we will try to improve our WP-based 
STW conversion with other types of WP data, 
such as NEVF and MWP (Tsai et al 2002 and 
2004), and statistical language models, such as 
HMM, and extend it to other areas of NLP, es-
pecially word segmentation and the mix-WP 
identifier from the word lattice of Chinese 
speech recognition systems.
