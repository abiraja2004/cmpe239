Abstract
Vector Space Models (VSM) have been
widely used in the language assessment field
to provide measurements of students? vocab-
ulary choices and content relevancy. How-
ever, training reference vectors (RV) in a VSM
requires a time-consuming and costly human
scoring process. To address this limitation, we
applied unsupervised learning methods to re-
duce or even eliminate the human scoring step
required for training RVs. Our experiments
conducted on data from a non-native English
speaking test suggest that the unsupervised
topic clustering is better at selecting responses
to train RVs than random selection. In addi-
tion, we conducted an experiment to totally
eliminate the need of human scoring. Instead
of using human rated scores to train RVs, we
used used the machine-predicted scores from
an automated speaking assessment system for
training RVs. We obtained VSM-derived fea-
tures that show promisingly high correlations
to human-holistic scores, indicating that the
costly human scoring process can be elimi-
nated.

1 Introduction
A Vector Space Model (VSM) is a simple, yet effec-
tive, method to measure similarities between doc-
uments or utterances, which has been utilized in
the educational testing field. For example, VSM
has been applied to detect students? off-topic es-
says (Higgins et al, 2006) and to automatically
score essays (Attali and Burstein, 2004).
The following three steps are required to use
VSM for automated assessment: (1) a collection
of responses are selected from each score category
to construct reference vectors (RV); (2) for an in-
put response under scoring, the same vectorization
method used for constructing RVs is applied to com-
pute an input vector (IV); (3) similarities between
this IV and the RVs for all score categories are com-
puted as features reflecting vocabulary usage and
content relevancy, including a widely used feature,
the cosine similarity between the IV and the RV for
the highest score category.
Clearly, the quality of VSM-derived features de-
pends on the proper training of RVs. In language
assessment, we tend to use a large number of man-
ually scored responses to build RVs for each testing
question (called item in the assessment field). How-
ever, this raises an issue: the requirement of manual
scoring of these responses by human raters. Also,
for large-scale assessments administrated globally,
a high number of items are typically administered
to both ensure the assessment security and support
the large volume of test-takers. To address this chal-
lenge of application of VSM, we will describe our
solutions based on applying unsupervised learning
methods in this paper.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 reviews the related previous research; Sec-
tion 3 describes the English assessment, the data
used in our experiments, and the Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) system used; Section 4 reports
58
the three experiments we conducted; and Section 5
discusses our findings and plans for future research.
2 Previous Work
Attali and Burstein (2004) used the VSM method
to measure non-native English writers? vocabulary
choices when scoring their essays by comparing
the words contained in an student?s response to the
words found in a sample of essays from each score
category. One belief behind this methodology is that
good essays will resemble each other in terms of the
word choice. In particular, two VSM-derived fea-
tures were used, including the maximum cosine sim-
ilarity and cosine similarity to the top score category.
Higgins et al (2006) applied the VSM technology to
detect students? off-topic essays whereby the word-
based IV from a student?s essay was compared to an
RV built from a collection of on-topic essays. When
the difference was larger than a pre-defined thresh-
old, the essay was marked as off-topic. Zechner and
Xi (2008) applied VSM as a content relevancy mea-
surement to score non-native English speaking re-
sponses. Recently, Xie et al (2012) explored the
VSM technology on automated speech scoring. Us-
ing a superior ASR to the one used in (Zechner and
Xi, 2008), they found that the VSM-derived features
had moderately high correlations with human profi-
ciency scores.
Dimension reduction, a critical step in apply-
ing VSM, removes the noises and minor details in
word-based vectors and keeps a concise semantic
structure. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deer-
wester et al, 1990) and Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003) are two widely used
dimension-reduction methods. Kakkonen et al
(2005) systematically investigated the dimension re-
duction methods used in the VSM methods for es-
say grading. Their experiments showed that LSA
slightly out-performs LDA.
Compared to supervised learning, unsupervised
learning can skip the time-consuming and costly
manual labeling process and has been widely used
in many machine-learning tasks. Both LSA and
LDA have been utilized in unsupervised document
clustering (Hofmann, 2001) to automatically sep-
arate a collection of documents into several sets
without any human intervention. Co-training is a
type of semi-supervised learning method (Blum and
Mitchell, 1998), consisting of two classifiers trained
from independent sets of features to predict the same
labels. It uses automatically predicted labels from
one classifier to train the other classifier.
3 Data
The data used in our experiments were collected
from the speaking section of Test Of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL R?), an English speak-
ing test used to evaluate students? basic English-
speaking skills for use in academic institutions that
use English as their primary teaching language. Our
data contains the speech responses for a total of 24
test items. For each item, both the stimulus mate-
rial and question were presented to test-takers fol-
lowed by a short amount of preparation time. The
test-takers were then given up to 60 seconds to pro-
vide their spoken responses. These responses were
scored by using carefully developed rating rubrics
by a group of experienced human raters. The scor-
ing rubrics covered a comprehensive list of differ-
ent aspects of speaking ability, such as pronuncia-
tion, prosody, vocabulary, content organization, etc.
A 4-point holistic scoring scale was used where the
score of 4 marks the most advanced English speak-
ers in the TOEFL R? test. Table 1 summarizes the re-
sponses across these 24 items, including mean, sd,
and sample size (n) of the total number of responses
and the number of responses per each score level.

sponses and the number of responses per each score level

The transcriptions of these spoken responses were
obtained by running a state-of-the-art non-native
ASR system. This ASR system uses a cross-word
tri-phone acoustic model (AM) and n-gram lan-
guage models (LMs) that were trained on approx-
imately 800 hours of spoken data and the corre-
sponding transcriptions. When being evaluated on
an held-out data set transcribed by humans from the
same test, a 33.0% word error rate was obtained.

4 Experiments
The three experiments described below shared the
same procedure: (1) for each item, available re-
sponses were divided into two sets - a set for train-
ing RVs and a set for evaluating the VSM-derived
features; (2) RVs were trained by using different re-
sponse selection methods investigated in this paper;
(3) the trained RVs were used to compute the VSM-
derived features; and (4) Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients (rs) between the VSM-derived features and
human-holistic scores were computed to measure
these features? predictive abilities in speech scoring.
This experimental procedure was conducted on all
24 items and was repeated in 10 iterations by using
varied training/evaluation-splitting plans and the av-
erages of these results across the items and iterations
are reported. Note that we removed some common
function words, such as a, the, etc., and some noise
words from ASR outputs, such as uh and um, when
applying the VSM method and always used LSA di-
mension reduction. We used the Gensim (R?ehu?r?ek
and Sojka, 2010) Python package to implement the
VSM-related computations in this paper. Also, in
this paper, we focused on one VSM-derived fea-
ture cos4, the cosine distance between an IV to the
RV representing the highest-score category (4) for
TOEFL R? test.
4.1 Data size for training RVs
In previous studies, researchers typically used a
large number of responses to construct RVs. For ex-
ample, Zechner and Xi (2008) used 1, 000 responses
while Xie et al (2012) increased the RV training
data to 2, 000 responses for each item. We ask, is
it possible to use fewer responses so that we would
not be forced to manually score so many responses?
To answer this question, we have investigated the re-
lationship between the size of the RV training data
and cos4?s predictive ability.
For each item, we first randomly selected 1, 800
responses as the RV training data and used the re-
maining responses as the evaluation set. We then
gradually reduced the RV training set to 1, 000, 500,
200, and even 50 responses and trained a series of
RVs. On the evaluation set, using these trained RVs,
we extracted cos4 VSM feature and calculated the
rcos4 for human-holistic scores. Table 2 reports the
average rcos4, which will de denoted as rcos4 there-
after, for the different-sized RV training sets. Table 2
shows that rcos4 continuously increases with the in-
crease of the dataset size for training RVs. However,
it is worth noting that using just 50 responses to train
RVs still provides a reasonably high rcos4 (0.383).
Between the two sizeRV conditions: 200 vs. 1800,
rcos4 did not show a statistically significant increase
based on a t-test (p = 0.314).

rcos4 0.383 0.428 0.435 0.439 0.440

performance, from different RV training data sizes
4.2 Using document clustering for training RVs
In the experiment described in section 4.1, we found
that using even a limited number of human-scored
responses can provide useful VSM features with a
reasonably high r to human-holistic scores. If we
can intelligently select such a small-sized dataset,
we think that the VSM-derived features will show
further improved predicting power. Armed with
this idea, we proposed a solution to use unsuper-
vised document clustering technology to find the re-
sponses for training RVs.
In particular, for each item, of the 1, 800 re-
sponses used for training the RVs, we run an LDA
document-clustering process to split all of responses
into K clusters. Then, for each cluster, we ran-
domly selected M responses. Therefore, we se-
lected K ?M responses for human scoring and for
training the RVs. Note that K ? M can be much
smaller than the original dataset size (n = 1800).
We believed that comprehensive coverage of all of
the latent topics would produce a better VSM that,
in turn, would provide more effective VSM-derived
features for scoring.
In our experiment, based upon a pilot study, we
decided to use K = 10 and M = 5 to control
the total scoring demand to be 50 responses per
item. Compared to the rcos4 value obtained from
randomly selecting 50 responses for training RVs
(0.383 in Table 2), the response selection based on
the document clustering improved the rcos4 to be
0.411. Furthermore, a t-test showed that such an in-
crease in rcos4 is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

4.3 Using machine predicted scores for
training RVs
Many of the previous automated speaking scoring
systems focused on the features measuring fluency,
pronunciation, and prosody (Witt, 1999; Franco et
al., 2010; Bernstein et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2009).
The scores predicted by these systems show promis-
ingly high correlations with human rated scores. In
order to eliminate the time-consuming and costly
human scoring step required by applications of
VSM, we considered using the scores automatically
scored by algorithms (AS) instead of the scores rated
by humans (HS).
In our experiment, we used a set of speech fea-
tures following (Chen et al, 2009) for automated
speech scoring. To estimate AS, a five-fold cross-
validation was applied on the entire dataset. For
each fold, a linear regression model was trained
from 80% of responses by using their HS and was
used to predict regression results on the remaining
20% of responses. The continuous scores produced
by the regression model were rounded to the four
discrete score levels (1 to 4) to serve as AS. Between
the obtained AS and HS, a Pearson r 0.56 was ob-
served.
Using the predicted scores, we re-ran our VSM
feature experiment by using the 1, 800 responses to
train the RVs. When the dataset sizes for training the
RVs was at 1, 800, we found that the rcos4 was 0.410
when using machine-predicted scores. Although it
was lower than the rcos4 value obtained by using
human-rated scores (0.440), a feature with such cor-
relational magnitude is still useful for building an
automatic scoring model.

Table 3: A summary of rcos4 using different RV training
sizes, unsupervised-response clustering, and automated-
predicted scores
Table 3 summarizes the three experiments de-
scribed above. HS1800 refers to using 1, 800 re-
sponses with human scores (HS) to train RVs for
each item. HS50 refers to using only 50 responses
with human rated scores. HScluster50 refers to us-
ing 50 responses that were selected to cover 10 la-
tent topics detected by using an LDA unsupervised
topic clustering method. Compared to HS50, we
find that the unsupervised topic clustering method
helped to improve rcos4. AS1800 refers to using
1, 800 responses with automatically predicted scores
(AS) to train RVs for each item. Compared to
HS1800, AS1800 that avoids using a time-consuming
and costly human scoring process, shows a reason-
ably high rcos4.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
Vector Space Models (VSMs) have been widely
used in essay and speech assessment tasks to provide
vocabulary usage and content relevance measure-
ments. However, applying VSM on the assessments
with many items requires a lot of work by human
raters. To make the application of VSM in assess-
ments more economical and efficient, we propose
the use of unsupervised learning methods to reduce
and even eliminate the time-consuming and costly
human-scoring process. First, we found that it was
possible to just use hundreds rather than thousands
of responses to train RVs when applying VSM. In
our experiments with TOEFL R? data, we found that
using a minimum 200 responses to train RVs for
each item, was not statistically significantly different
from using 1, 800 responses. Next, we used an LDA
document-clustering method to identify latent top-
ics from all of the items and used the topic informa-
tion to select responses for training RVs. Our exper-
iments clearly suggest that such a method of selec-
tion provides more effective VSM features than ran-
dom selection. Finally, we used the scores predicted
by an automated speech scoring system that mostly
uses fluency and pronunciation features to replace
human-rated scores in building the VSM. Our exper-
iments suggest that the features derived from such a
VSM that can be constructed without the need of hu-
man scoring show promisingly high correlations to
human-holistic scores.
This research can be extended in several new di-
rections. First, we will apply the proposed methods
on other language assessment tasks, such as on long
(written) essays, to fully test that the proposed meth-
ods are universally helpful. Second, we are consid-
ering doing the third experiment in more iterations
? adding the VSM-derived features into the auto-
61
mated scoring model so that more accurate machine-
predicted scores can be used for building further im-
proved VSM.
