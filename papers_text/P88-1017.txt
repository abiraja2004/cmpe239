Abstract 
This paper presents a unification-based approach to 
Japanese honorifics based on a version of HPSG (Head-driven 
Phrase Structure Grammar)ll\]121. Utterance parsing is based 
on lexical specifications of each lexical item, including 
honorifics, and a few general PSG rules using a parser capable 
of unifying cyclic feature structures. It is shown that the 
possible word orders of Japanese honorific predicate 
constituents can be automatically deduced in the proposed 
framework wi thout  independently specifying them. 
Discourse Information Change Rules (DICRs) that al low 
resolving a class of anaphors in honorific contexts are also 
formulated. 
1. In t roduct ion  
Japanese has a rich grammaticalized system of honorifics 
to express the speaker's honorific attitudes toward discourse 
agents (i.e. persons who are related to the discourse). As 
opposed to such written texts as scientific or newspaper 
articles, where the author's rather 'neutral' honorific attitude 
is required, in spoken dialogues, an abundant number of 
honorific expressions is used and plays an important role in 
resolving human zero-anaphors. 
In this paper, a unification-based approach to Japanese 
honorifics is proposed. First, Mizutani's theory of honorific 
expression actl3\] is introduced to define basic honorific 
attitude types used in specifying pragmatic onstraints on the 
use of Japanese honorifics. Then a range of honorifics are 
classified into subtypes from a morphological and syntactico- 
semantic perspective and examples of their  lexical 
specifications are shown. The main characteristics of the 
utterance parser and an approach to explaining possible 
word orders of honorific predicate constituents are described. 
Finally, Discourse Information Change Rules are formulated 
that resolve a class of anaphors in honorific contexts. 
2. Speaker's Honor i f ic  At t i tudes  toward  Discourse 
Agents  
2.1. Grammatical  Aspects of  Honori f ics 
A distinction must be made between the speaker's 
honorific attitude as determined by the utterance situation 
(the social relationship between discourse agents, the 
atmosphere of the setting, etc), and the honorific attitude as 
expressed by special linguistic means independent of the 
? utterance situation. For example, by violating a usage 
principle for the determination of an honorific attitude (i.e. 
"one should not exalt oneself in front of others"), uses of an 
honorific expression about the speaker himself can function 
as a kind of joke. However, without he help of grammatical 
properties of honorifics independent of particular utterance 
situations, the violation of a usage principle itself could not 
be recognized at all, thus the expression could not function as 
a joke. Though the former situational determination of 
honorific attitude is an interesting subject matter for socio 
and psycho-linguistic researchers, the latter grammatical 
properties of hot~orifics are our concern here and what is 
described with lexical specifications for honorifics. 
2.2. Mizutani 's  Theory  o f  Honor i f ic  Expression Act 
Mizutani's theory of honorif ic expression act is 
introduced to define basic honorific attitude types that 
stipulate the pragmatic onstraints on Japanese honorifics. In 
this model, discourse agents are positioned in an ~bstract 
two-dimenslonal honorific space (Fig. 1). How they are 
positioned is a socio and psycho-linguistic problem, which is 
not pursued here. 
Agent P (px,py) 
Hearer (hx,hy) e e~,~ 
Speaker (0,0) ~"  
Agent Q (qx,qy) 
I 
Fig 1. Honorific Space 
An honorific expresson act reflects the configuraion of 
these discourse agent points. The speaker is set as the point 
of origin, and the speaker's honorific attitude toward a 
discourse agent, say P, is defined as the position vector of 
point P. The speaker's honorific attitude toward agent P 
relative to agent Q is defined as a vector from point Q to 
point P. The value and the direction of the vector are defined 
as follows: 
139 
Honorific Value : 
for v = (x. y), the honorific value of a vector v (written 
as IvJ) is defined as: 
Ivl = y i f fx=0;  
0 i f fx  ~0;  
Honorific Direction : 
a. up I , t>0 ,  
b. down Ivi < O, 
c. f lat Iv~=O and x=O,  
d. across Ivl = 0 and x ~ O. 
IN.B.J Assuming an honorific space to be two dimensional (not one 
dimensional), an across direction can be distinguished from a fiat direction. 
An acrosS direction of a vector corresponds to the case where no positive 
honorific relation between the two agents (i.e. up, down, or flat) is 
recognized by the speaker. 
Though the speaker's honor i f i c  a t t i tudes  can be 
characterized from several v iewpoints  (e.g. up/down,  
d is tant /c lose,  fo rmal / in fo rmal ) ,  Mizutan i ' s  mode l  is 
appropriate for describing Japanese honorifics because the 
up~down aspect most relevantly characterizes Japanese 
honorifics. Moreover, i t  is not clear how the other aspects are 
independently grammatical ized in the Japanese honorif ic 
system. 
Based on the direction of the vector defined above, the 
fol lowing four subtypes of honorific att i tude relations are 
distinguished. 
Honorific Att itude Type : 
a. honor-up 
b. honor-down 
c. honor-f lat 
e. honor-across

3.1. C lass i f i ca t ion  o f  Japanese  Honor i f i cs  
3.1.1. Morpho log ica l  V iewpo int  
In Japanese, words in a wide range of syntactic categories 
(i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, nominal-verbs, nomina l -  
adjectives, etc) are systematically put into their  honorif ic 
forms. They are classified into two  subtypes according to how 
they are derived from their nonhonorific forms. 
Classification by the lexical derivation type: 
honorif ic-word = 
a. regular-form-honorif ic-word 
(e.g. "ookak-i" from "kak-i" \[writevinf\]) 
\[HP-\[writevstem-CSinf\]l 
b. irregular-form-honorif ic-word 
(e.g. "ossyar-" from "iw-" \[speakvstem\]) 
|N.B.\] HP and CS stand for 'Honoric Prefix' and 'Conjugation Suffix' 
respectively. Words is transcribed in its phonemic representation. 
While regular-form honorific words share a common base 
with their nonhonorific forms because they are derived by 
the productive honorif ic-affixation process, irregular-form 
honorific words have special word forms that have no direct 
connection to their nonhonorific forms. This distiction plays 
an important role in the lexical specification of honorifics and 
in possible word orders of Japanese honorif ic predicate 
constituents. 
3.1.2. Syntact i co -Semant ic  V iewpo int  
In traditional school grammar, Japanese honorifics have 
been classified into  three categor ies:  respect words  
('sonkeigo'), condescending words ('kenjougo'), and pol ite 
words ('teineigo'). However, in this tradit ional  tr ipart i te 
classif ication, common features of respect-words and 
condescending-words not shared by pol ite-words are not 
explicit. That is, while an agent toward whom the speaker's 
honorific attitude is expressed must be grammatically located 
in the sentence (i.e. as subject or object) in the case of respect 
or condescending words, this requirement does not apply to 
polite words. Thus a more elaborate classification is adopted. 
Conventional terms are replaced by Haradal4l 's more 
syntactico-semantically motivated ones. 
Classification by the syntactic role of an aqent to whom the 
speaker's honorific attitude is expressed: 
honorif ic-word = 
a. proposit ional-honorif ic-word= 
a. 1. subject-honorific-word (respect-word) 
(e.g. "kudaser-u" \[give~nf\]) 
a.2.object-honorific-word(condescendiog-word) 
(e.g. "sesiage-ru" lgivev~ef\]) 
b. performative-honorif ic-word (polite-word) 
(e.g. 'des-u', 'mas-u') 
IN.B.\] For example, averb which takes a nonanimete subject (e.g. "fur-u" 
in the sentece "Ame (rain) ga (SBJ) fur-u(fall). ? IThe rain falb.\]) can be put 
into its performative honorific form ('Ame ga fur-i mas-u.'), but not into its 
subject honorific form (* "Ante ga o-for-t ni nar-u.'). This is in accordance 
with the difference between propositional honorifics and performative 
honorificl. 
IN.B.\] There are a class of words which function in between the a.2 and b 
types of honorifics (e.g. "mair-u" \[go/come~\] in "Basu ga mair-i mas-u." 
\[A bus will come.\]). Let us call them propositional-performattve-wordl. 
Minus-honorifics are given no place in the tradit ional 
tripartite classification. However, they are classified in our 
approach as correponding to the expressed honorific attitude 
types. 
140 
Classification by the expressed honorific attitude type: 
honorific-word = 
a. plus-honorific-word 
(e.g. "aw-a-re-ru" \[meetregular.sbjhon\]) 
\[{.,.meet~tem'CSvong\]-PlusHonAuxv~tem-CSaml\] 
b. minus-honorific-word 
(e.g. "aw-i-yagar-u" \[meetregular-sbjhon\]) 
\[\[...meet~em-C$1nf|-MinusHonAux~tm-CSm~J 
IN B.\] The Japanese honorific system has no systematized means to 
positively express honor-flat or honor-across honorific attitudes. An non- 
honorific plain word form may express honor-flat honorific attitudes towerd 
a discourse agent in a situation such as speaking to an old friend, while it may 
express honor-across honorific attitudes in a situation such as writing a 
technical paper. 
Because the classfications of honorifics from different 
viewpoints as summarized above are cross-categorical, and 
thus independent of one another, a single honorific word 
(e.g. "hozak-u" \[sayvsenf\]) can function at the same time as 
irregular-form-honorific-word, subject-honorific-word, and 
minus-honorific-word. 
3.2. A Unif ication-based Lexical Approach 
A unification-based lexicalism approach is adopted here 
for describing Japanese honorifics for the following reasons: 
(a) a unification-based approach enables the integrated 
description of information from various kinds of sources 
(syntax, semantics, etc), thus allowing their simultaneous 
analysis; 
(b) a lexical approach helps to increase the modularity of 
grammar. In this approach, a grammar has only a small 
number of general syntactic rule schemata and most of 
grammatical information is to be specified in a lexicon. 
Linguistic word-class generalizations can be formed by 
making grammatical categories complex by representing 
them with feature-structures. 
The specification of verbal category honorifics is 
important because the verbal categories are the most 
productive in the honorification process, and thus 
appropriate to clearly show how diverse aspects of the 
Japanese honorific system are described in this approach. 
3.3. Examples of lexical specifications 
3.3.1. Regular-Form Honorifics 
Subject Honorif icat ion by "Vvong + (ra)re-ru" 
Regular form honorifics are compositionally analyzed by 
giving lexical specifications for each honorific-word 
formation formative. For example, most plain-form verbs can 
be put into their simple subject-plus-honorific form by 
postpositioning the auxiliary verb "(ra)re-ru" to them ('re- 
ru" and "rare-ru" are allomorphs of a single morpheme). 
Lexical information for these formatives is specified in the 
feature structure: 
\ [ \ [orth(orthography) ?orth\] 
\[head \[\[pos(part-or-speech) v\] 
\[ctype(conJugat|on-type) vowel\] 
\[cform(conJugatton-rorm) stem\]I \]  
\[adjacent ?prod\]

\[Sam ?predsam\] 
\[prsg \ [ \ [ res t rs  { \ [ \ [ re ln  honor-up\] 
\ [or ig in  espeakar e\]

where <?orth ?pradctypa> E (<'ra"  cons>

IN.g,\] ? ~ a prefix for a tag-name used to represent a token identity of 
feature-~ru~ures. *Speaker* is a special global variable bound to a feature 
stru~ure representing the speaker's information. 
The 'prag' feature describes the pragmatic constraint on 
this expression (the "honor-up" relationship from the 
speaker to the subject agent of the predicate is required for 
this expression to be used in a pragmatically appropriate 
way). Description with the 'honor-up' honorific attitude 
relation shows that this expression is a 'plus-honorific' 
expression. Structure-sharing of the 'goal' feature value of 
this honorifc attitude relation with the semantic value of the 
predicate's subject shows that this expression is a 'subject- 
honorific' expression. The requirement for the 'orth' feature 
value (?'orth) and the 'ctype' value in the 'subcat' feature 
(?predctype) describes the morphophonemic haracteristic of 
this morpheme by stipulating that 're-(ru)' subcategorize for 
either a regular consonant-stem ctype verb or an irregular 
ctype verb ('suru'\[do\]), and that 'rare-(ru)' subcategorize for 
either a regular vowel-stem ctype verb or an irregular ctype 
verb ('kuru' \[come\]), correctly allowing (la) and (lc) but not 
fib).

d. *Kyoositu ? ko $ensei ga rare to.

The 'adjacent' feature is a special feature which assures 
that its value be the first element in the list when the set 
descr ipt ion in the 'subcat'  value is expanded into  list 
descriptions by a rule reader. The specification of this feature 
implies that this morph is a bound morph and thus requires its 
adjacent element to be realized as a nonnull phonetic form. 
Though the set description in the 'subcat' value is introduced 
to a l low word order variation among complement daughters 
in Japanese ,  w i thout  th i s  k ind  o f  spec i f i ca t ion ,  
ungrammatical sequences such as ( ld)  are also al lowed for 
auxil iariy verbs. 
\[N.B.) A set description in the subcat feature of a feature 
sturucture,\[ladjacent ?c\]\[subcat ETa ?b ?c)\]|, for example, is expanded into its 
corresponding two possible list descriptions by a rule reader as follows: 
I\[adjacent 7c)\[subcat (:or <7c ?b ?a> <?c ?a ?b>)\]. Furthermore, 
<?c ?b ?a>. for example, is expanded into a feature structure such as 
\[Jfirst ?c\]\[rest \[Ifirst 7bnrest Ilfirst ?a\]\[rest end\]\]. 
Object Honorification by "HP  + Vinf  + suru"  
Next, let  us consider a more compl icated fo rmat ion  
pattern for deriving a regular object-plus-honorific form. As 
productive as the above "Vvong + (ra)re-ru" pattern is, an 
"HP +Vinf +suru" pattern can put most verbs w i th  two  
grammatical  human arguments into thei r  corresponding 
object honorific forms as follows: 
"o + aw-i + suru" from "aw-"  (meetvstem), 
"go + shoukai + suru" from "shoukai" (introduce-verse). 
IN.B.\] "o," and "go-" are two forms of s single morpheme (honorific 
prefix) that is prefixed to words in a variety of syntactic categories (See 
Appendix I). The choice depends on the following element's origin. If the 
element is a Sine-Japanese morpheme (kango), the honorifc prefix takes the 
form "go-'; if it is a native one, the honorific prefix is realized as "o-', 
though there are exceptions. 
In a naive analysis of Japanese honorifics, these honorific 
forms derive from their  corresponding plain forms by a simple 
object honori f icat ion lexical rule that  does not  take into  
account their internal constituent structures (e.g. "aw-u" --) 
"o-aw-i-suru').  Accordingly, this kind of naive analysis is 
inadequate for the fo l lowing reasons: 
Ca) it is arguable that  "HP+Vinf"  forms a uni t  in some 
structural level before forming the unit  "HP + Vinf + suru' ,  
cons ider ing  the  ex is tence o f  such const ruct ions  as 
" l I P+Vin f+n i+nar -u"  (normal -sb j -p lus -hon- fo rm) ,  
"HP + Vinf + negaw-u( request ) ' ,  and "HP + Vinf + i tadak-  
u(receive-favorirregular.obj.plus.hon.form)', but this assertion is 
not explicitly illustrated in a naive ana4~sis; 
(b) though some adverb ia l  postposi t ions such as "we"  
(contrastive), "me"  (also) and "sae" (even) can appear inside 
the object  honor i f ic  form (e.g. "o -aw- i -WA-suru ' ,  "go-  
shoukai-SAE-MO-suru'), it  is diff icult to derive these forms by 
a naive analysis in l ight of the general izat ion concerning 
adverbial postpositions appearing in other environments 
(e.g. "Sensei ga kyoositu DAKE e WAko rare ta" \[the teacher 
came only to the classroom\] );
(c) a naive analysis fails to explain the kind of the elements 
that can operate as a Vinf element in the pattern, which is 
automatically explained in the proposed framework as wil l  be 
shown in section 5. 
This regu lar  ob jec t -p lus -honor i f i ca t ion  process is 
composit ional ly  analyzed in the proposed f ramework  by 
giving each of its formatives a lexical specification, inthe same 
manner as the "Vvong + (ra)re-ru" pat tern  subject-plus- 
honorific analysis. 
Here the expression "o-aw-i-suru" is analized. Fig 3.a 
represents the lexical information of the verb "aw-'  (meet) in

Fig 3.C. Honorific prefixation rule 
IN.B.i The rule stated in an extended version of PATR41 notation consists 
of two parts; CFG-part and constraints. CFG-part is used to propose an 
efficient top-down expectation in the parser. Constraints are required for 
the rule application to end successfully. Here, all constraints are described by 
equations of two feature structures. ?< >" is used to denote a feature 
structure path, and ? , , "  to denote a token identity relation between two 
feature structures. 
142 
The 'headlcoh(CategoryOfHead)' feature of a category 
specifies the kind of its head. An HP can take a lexical 
infinitive-form verb whose 'can-take-hp' value is' + '. An HP is 
assigned its appropriate realization form (.) (in this case, "o" 
form), because its 'orth' value and the head's 'hpform' value 
are the same. The first equation in the rule statement 
prevents a second application of the honorific prefixation 
rule to the same verb (*'o-o-aw-i ?) by specifying that the 
mother category's 'can-take-hp' feature value be ,., (**) The 
other equations in the rule are ones common to the adjunct- 
head structures. 
I*N.B.\] A note is needed here concerning the realization of Hr. When the 
adjacent feature of the second right-hand-side symbol in the CFG-part is nil 
as in the above case, it is enough just to concatenate both 'orth' feature 
values of the right-hand-side symbols and make it the 'orth' feature value of 
the left-hand-side symbol. However. when the head element's adjacent 
feature has a nonnull value (i.e. in the case that the head element is n bound 
morph)o a more complicted operation is needed. But here we only mention 
its necessity and avoid its precise formulation to save space. 
I**N.BJ The 'can-take-hp' feature is specified as '-' not only for already HP- 
prefixed elements, but also for almost all irregular form honorific verbs (e.g. 
*'o-osshar-i'lsay\], *'o-itadak-i'lreceive*favorD and most mono-synablic 
infinitive-form verbs that have corresponding irregular-form honorifics (e.g. 
*'o-si" \[doJ, *'o-mi" \[look atJ). 
Next, the usual complement-head structure rule (Fig 3.d) 
is applied to the resulting feature structure for "o-aw-i" and 
the feature structure for a normal object-plus honorification 
formative ('-suru', as shown in Fig 3.e). Thus the normal 
object plus honorifc form ('o-aw-i-(suru)') for "aw-'\[meet\] is 
obtained in a compositional way.

3.3.2. I r regular  Form Honor i f ics 
Irregular form honorifics share most of their lexical 
information with their nonhonorific counterparts. In our 
framework, redundant lexical specification for irregular-form 
honorifics is avoided by using lexical inheritance mechanism 
from their superclassas. For example, the necessary lexical 
specification for the irregular subject honorific form "(- 
te)itadak-" of the donatory auxiliary verb "(-te)moraw-" is 
reduced, as shown in Fig 4.a. This turns out to be equivalent 
to Fig 4.b by unifying pieces of information from its super- 
classes, te-receive-favor and obj-plus-hon.

4. Uni f icat ion-based CFG Parser 
Fig 5 shows the organization of the unification-based CFG 
parser. The parser is essentially based on Earley's algorithm, 
and unifies feature structures in its completion process. The 
description of grammatical rules and lexical items are 
complied into feature structures by the rule reader. 
Unification of cyclic feature structuers might be necessary 
to analyze certain expressions. To give some examples: 
(a) frozen honorific words such as "o-naka" (belly) and "go- 
ran" (to look at) must always be prefixed by an HP (the

Fig 5. Organization of the Unification-based Parser 
In describing the above linguistic phenemena, it is convenient 
if requirements f.or its head category can be specified not only 
for adjunct elements, but also for complement elements. In 
such cases, one more equation as follows needs to be added 
to the usual head-complement structure rule statement 
shown in Fig 3.d. 
<1 head coh> . .  <2> 
The complied feature structure for the equations in Fig 3.d 
plus the above equation includes a cyclic structure as shown 
in Fig 6 
An extended version of WroblewskilS\]'s feature structure 
unification algorithm was developed to allow rule statements 
including cyclesl61. The extended algorithm can unify cyclic 
feature structures while avoiding unnecessary overcopying of 
feature stuructures. 
5. Word  Order  o f  Honor i f i c  Predicate Const i tuents  
In Japanese, a verbal predicate is composed of one main 
verb and postpositioned auxiliary verbs (though possibly 
none exist). Because both main verbs and auxiliary verbs may 
have honorific forms, various sequences of honorifics might 
be expected to occur in a predicate as a simple matter of 
possible combinations. However, their possible word orders 
are restricted by a grammatical principles. Traditionally, 
possibile word orders were described in detail and the 
s 
REST 
Fig 6. Cyclic part of the compiled feature structure 
144 
explanations for them were given from a rather speculative 
perspective. In this research, it is shown how possible word 
orders can be deduced from lexical specifications of 
honorifics. 
5.1. Propos i t ional  and Performat ive Honor i f ics 
A propositional honorific formative always precedes a 
performative honorific formative. For example, though 
"awa-re-masu" (\[\[\[meetvong\]-SbjPIusHon\]-PerformativeHon\]) 
and "o-awi-s i -masu" (\[\[\[HP-meetvlnf\]-ObjPlusHonJ- 
PerformativeHon\]) are possible expressions, they would be 
impossible i f  their  word orders were reversed (i.e. 
performative honorif ic placed before proposit ional  
honorific). 
This restr ict ion on word order is considered a 
consequence of the lexical specifications for both types of 
honori f ics.  As shown in section 3, proposit ional  
honorification formatives subcategorize a verbal category 
whose subject (and object) elements are not filled yet as its 
adjacent element. On the other hand, a performative 
honorification formative subcategorizes a verbal category 
with saturated subcategorization. This represents the lexical 
specification for "mesu ?. 
\[\[orth " ' \ ]  
\[heed \[\[pos v\]\[ctype musu\]\[cforll stem\] 
\[4rrugullr-cforlu \[\[senf mesu\]...\]\]\]\] 
\[cen-tlko-hp -\] 
\[adjacent ?prod\] 
\[subcut {?prud\[\[heud \[\[pos v\]\[cform usu\]\]\] 
\[suhcet (}\]  
\[sea ?predsum\]\]\]J 
\[sims ?prudsms\] 
\[prig \[\[restrs {\[\[reln honor-up\] 
\[ordgdn Ospuakure\] 
loom1 *hem.re\]\]}\]\] \] \]  
Fig 7. Lexical Specification for a performative honorification 
formative "masu" 
The performative honorif icaton formative "masu" 
cannot, therefore, immediately precede a propositional 
honorification formative due to the requirement concerning 
the adjacent element of propositional honorifics. The 
opposite order, however, constitutes a syntactically 
legitimate structure. 
5.2. Subject and Object Honor i f ics  
An object honorific formative must precede a subject 
honorific formative, though there is an important class of 
exceptions (verbs that subcategorize a 'te' form verb as an 
adjacent element such as "(-te)itadak-'\[receive-favor\]). For 
example, "o-awi-sa-reru" (\[\[\[HP-meetvtnf\]-ObjPlusHon|- 
SbjPIusHon\]) is a possible word order, but "o-awa-re-suru" 
(\[\[HP-\[meetvong-SbjPlusHon\]\]-ObjPlusHon\]) i  not possible if 
"-re(ru)" is used as an honorification formative. This word 
order restriction can be explained in the same way as for the 
above case: that is, as shown in section 3, the normal object 
honorif ication formative %suru" subcategorizes a verb 
whose subject and object are not yet filled. The simple subject 
honor|float|on formative "-(ra)reru" that requires its object to 
be already fi l led cannot, therefore, precede the normal 
subject plus honor i f i ca t ion  fo rmat ive  on account of  
conflicting specifications for the 'subcat' value. Otherwise, 
no conflict exist. 
Other kinds of restrictions on the possible word order of 
Japanese honorific predicate constituents can likewise be 
explained in the proposed framework. 
6. Anaphora  Reso lut ion  in Honor i f ic  Contexts  
In Japanese honorific contexts, many human anaphors 
can be resolved by recourse to pragmatic constraints on the 
use of honorifics. This is an attempt to apply DR theory to the 
anaphora resolution in Japanse honorific contexts. 
Discourse information is represented by a feature 
structure consisting of a set of reference markers (Universe) 
and a set of conditions, as in the standard version of DR 
(Discourse Representation) theoryl7\]. Fig 8.a is the initially 
posited DRS (Discourse Representation Structure). Addition 
of other discourse information to the initial ORS does not 
affect the theory.

\[conds {}3\]

(N.B.1} Reference markers for the indexicals are directly anchored to 
objects in the world, but the anchoring information isnot shown here. 
Now let (3a) represent a discourse-initial utterance.

"Once when ACL-88 was held. I met (object-honorific and 
performative-honorific) a ertain famous computational linguist. ?
From this, Fig 8.b is unified as its semantic/pragmatic 
information. The method of specifying necessary lexical 
information was briefly explained in section 3. 
The init ial  discouse in format ion is updated by the 
semantic/pragmatic in format ion of a new utterance as 
follows: First, DICR 1, shown in Fig 9.a below, is applied to 
the semantic value of a new utterance. DICR 2 is then applied 
to the pragmatic value. Meanwhile, anaphoric expressions in 
a new utterance are resolved so that the NFCIS| shown in Fig 
9.b below is observed. 
In this case, Fig 8.c is obtained as an updated DRS, because the 
type of semlcont value is a 'basic-circumstance' and every

Fig 8.c. Resulting Semantic Information for (3b) 
Because the index 7x18 for "song keisan-gengogaku-sha" 
(that computational linguist) has a \]familiarity '+\] attribute 
based on the lexical specification for 'song', an attempt is 
made to resolve it by unifying 7x16 with an element of the 
kluniv value, requiring that their restrictions can also be 
unif ied. It stands to  reason that  i t  can be resolved 
because 7x16 and 7x02 are, semantically speaking, unifiable, 
because their semantic restrictions are {\[\]rein 'computational- 
linguist\]!instance 7x16\]\]} and \[\[\[reln 'computational- 
linguist\]linstance ?x02\]\] Ilreln 'famous)\[instance ?x02\]\]) respectively, and 
their variable types are both 'individual', which causes no 
incompatibility. However, their pragmatic restrictions 
({llreln 'honor-downJlagent %peeker*)lob\]act 7x16|\] \[\[reln "honor- 
upJlagent %peaker*\]lobject "hearer*\]\]}, and {(\[reln 'honor-up)\[agent 
*speaker*)lob\]act ?x02\]\] \]It*In 'honor-up\]iagent *speeker*\]lobject 
*hearer*)l}) prevent ?x16 from being unified with ?x02, due to 
the stipulation 'llreln 'honor-up\]\[agent ?ailobject ?b\]\] A \[Ireln 'honor- 
down)\[agent ?el\]object ?b)\] - bottom'. This anaphoric resolution 
therefore fails. Other ways of resolving this anaphoric 
expression also fail because of the incompatibi l ity of their 
variable types or semantic features. In any case, utterance 
(3b) turns out to be infelicitous by NFC. 
Unlike (3b), utterance (3b'), whose sem/prag values are 
the same as Fig 8.c except  for  \[\[rein 'honor-up)\[agent 
*speaker*)lob\]act ?x16\]\] instead of \[\]rein 'honor-down)\[agent 
*speaker*)\]object ?x16\]\], can be given a fel ic itous reading, 
because anaphora resolution is possible w i thout  violat ing

IN.L) Our DICRI with NFC also explain the failure of coindexing "song 
keisan-gengogaku-she" in (4b) with a universally quantified expression 
?done ... me" (every ...) in a previous utterance, because the reference 
markers introduced for a universally quantified expression are in sul:mrdiate 
DRSs by OICR 1 end not accessible from "song keisan-gangogaku-she" as a 
possible antecedent. )

Though many issues rermain unaddressed concerning 
anaphora resolution in Japanese honorific contexts, these can 
be approached by use of the proposed model. This model 
regards discourse understanding as the process of unifying 
various kinds of partial information, including contextual 
information. 
7. Condusion 
A unification-based approach to Japanese honorifics 
based on a version of HPSG was proposed. Utterance parsing 
is based on the lexical specifications of a range of honorifics 
using a parser capable of unifying cyclic feature structures. 
The developed parser constitutes an impor tant  part of 
NADINE (NAtural  Dialogue INterpretat ion Expert),  an 
experimental system which translates Japanese-English 
telephone and inter-keyboard ialogues.
