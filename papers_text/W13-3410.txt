Abstract 
We present in the paper our experience of 
involving the students of the department 
of theoretical and computational linguis-
tics of the Moscow State University into 
full-cycle activities of preparing and eval-
uating the results of the NLP Evaluation 
forums, held in 2010 and 2012 in Russia. 
The forum of 2010 started as a new initia-
tive and was the first independent evalua-
tion of morphology parsers for Russian in 
Russia. At the same time the forum cam-
paign has been a source of a successful 
academic course which resulted in a close-
knit student team, strong enough to im-
plement the two-year research for the sec-
ond forum on syntax, held in 2012. The 
new forum of anaphora (to be held in 
2014) is now prepared mostly by students. 
1 Introduction 
Russian computational linguistics counts more 
than 50 years history, started with the first MT 
research in 1955 (Bar-Hilel 1960). Still up to the 
first decade of the 21 century all the research 
groups ? those, inheriting the Soviet tradition, as 
well as the new commercial industry labs - exist-
ed in a disjoined mode. The absence of the 
state-of-the-art investigation on the performance 
of parsers for Russian as well as on the effect of 
different computational methods for Russian rich 
morphology impeded the teaching of computa-
tional linguistics, making it dilettantish. It?s not 
surprising that the first initiative of the Evalua-
tion forum emerged in the academy. The aca-
demic status of the initiative also guaranteed its 
independence. The complete cycle of the forum 
in 2010 on morphology, starting with mark-up 
scheme of the Gold Standard and ending the final 
paper preparation has served as a basis for a 
course in computational linguistics with excel-
lent set of tasks for students to carry out.  The 
problem of the first year experience was insuffi-
cient communication with all the participants 
during the forum preparation. This is very im-
portant for the pioneer status of the forum and 
also the educational perspective of the initiative. 
That?s why the two year period of forum prepa-
ration has been chosen. The task of the first year 
is to prepare and hold a round-table open to all 
the potential participants where the basic deci-
sions on the test collections, tasks, mark-up and 
evaluation process are made. The task of the sec-
ond year is the evaluation forum itself and the 
preparation of an overview paper. Below we will 
focus on the educational process: we will de-
scribe student tasks during the complete cycle of 
the evaluation forum preparation. The consistent 
practical aim of the course distinguishes in from 
most of the courses in computational linguistics 
(Hearst, 2005; Liddy and McCracken, 2005; 
Baldridge and Erk, 2008). This is a course in 
NLP evaluation which, as we believe, gives stu-
dents very useful theoretical and practical skills 
of making sound and deliberate decisions during 
linguistic data analyses. The main idea of the 
course is to involve students into solving ?real-
life? expert tasks, and to show them multiple ap-
proaches to mark-up and data analysis. We 
would like to underline that the practical value of 
the course: students not only do the routine as-
sessment procedure, but analyze the best practic-
es and create the design of the forum. The course 
is organized as follows: students complete tasks 
at home and discuss the results at class with two 
61
or three instructors. The experienced students 
may act as instructors also. The class ends by 
collective presentation at the conference. Stu-
dents work in small teams of 2 or 3 persons, each 
team doing its piece of work. All the students 
have strong background in theoretical linguistics 
and math, some students have good program-
ming skills. The main stages of the first year are: 
1) getting theoretical background 2) first mark-
up experience and proto-gold standard 3) feed-
back from the participants 4) round-table prepa-
ration. The second year consists of the following 
stage: 5) preparing Gold Standard 6) results 
evaluation 7) final paper preparation. These stag-
es correspond to the four semesters of special 
courses on NLP, home task activities, hands-on 
student activities and practice in academic writ-
ing. Each of the stage will be discussed below. 
The corresponding teaching methods are de-
scribed in a separate section. 
2 Background task 
The first task students have to complete is to 
study theoretical background which consists of a) 
actual evaluation practices b) state of art of Rus-
sian NLP systems that can potentially participate 
in the forum. Primarily students study reports of 
the main evaluation forums that have been held 
on the current task. The topics to be discussed in 
class are: the types of system running the compe-
titions (statistical, rule-based, hybrid), their theo-
retical linguistic basis: for example, HPSG 
parsers or dependency parsers for syntax; the test 
collections, their sources, size and mark-up 
scheme; the tasks and their metrics; the perfor-
mance rate. The students have to find the an-
swers on all this questions making their way 
through exhaustive reports, they have to draw out 
some common grounds to be compared and ana-
lyzed. For example for the syntax forum (Gar-
eyshina et al, 2012) tree-banks of different lan-
guages and structure types has been analyzed and 
compared. The very important point of this stage 
is that it results in collective determining some 
ideal scenario of the future forum which is to be 
inevitably corrected by performing the second 
investigation ? examining all the information 
about the potential participants, such as collect-
ing and reading all the related papers, testing 
demos or installing the open-source resources. 
For example, the main problem for the morphol-
ogy forum was to determine a mark-up scheme 
that would be convenient for all the participants 
(Lyasevskaya et al, 2010). This problem is cru-
cial because of Russian rich morphology and the 
variety of theoretical traditions different systems 
rest upon. The investigation of syntactic parsing 
(all the systems that took part in the forum, use 
dependency parsing) revealed the impossibility 
to compare the types of syntactic relations speci-
fied by different systems. The fact is not surpris-
ing bearing in mind that there is no open tree-
bank such as Penn tree bank to be trained on for 
Russian. The workshop devoted to comparing 
different syntactic parsing outputs has been ex-
hausting but fruitful: we arrived to a decision that 
the main task of the forum should include only 
evaluating what syntactic heads were to be 
marked by the participants. Correctness of pars-
ing the whole sentence was decided to count as 
irrelevant. Only the choice of the head was eval-
uated. We would like to underline that the design 
and the scenario of the forums are always deter-
mined as a result of individual work of student 
groups together with collective analysis and 
summing-up conclusions. Finally the last but not 
the least object of this task is to juxtapose theo-
retical and computational linguistics: students 
have to analyze the scope of underlining linguis-
tic phenomena and to compare them with applied 
realizations in NLP. The more sophisticated lin-
guistic task is in focus, the more interesting top-
ics are raised in class. For example, the examina-
tion of different principles of anaphoric resolu-
tion this year showed the limits of applied tasks 
and solutions (particularly in discourse anaphora 
resolution and identifying lexical coherence de-
termined extralinguistically), and revealed the 
perspectives of future development in NLP and 
artificial intelligence. The analysis is then partly 
fulfilled in Gold Standard mark-up. The scheme 
is always broader then it has to be for the evalua-
tion task. The important additional outcome of 
such corpus mark-up is to prepare some new 
open resource that can serve also for corpus lin-
guistic and theoretical linguistic research. 
3 First mark-up experience and first 
feedback 
As it has been noted earlier the theoretical stage 
of the course results in the forum scenario and 
the mark-up scheme for the Gold Standard. At 
the next stage students begin by making mark-up 
on a few selected texts. Each text is marked-up 
with several students and all the cases of interan-
notator discrepancy have to be analyzed and dis-
cussed in class. The discussion leads to formulat-
ing more distinct mark-up criteria as well as to 
62
determining the cases which should not be eval-
uated. The mark-up is made by special tool pro-
grammed by the students with good program-
ming skills. The specification of requirements for 
the tool is also the task to be performed by stu-
dents. The first mark-up staging is all in one test-
ing the mark-up scheme, elaboration of the eval-
uation framework and metrics as well as tech-
nical testing of the tool. As a result some small 
(usually 100 sentences) ?pre-gold? standard is 
made. Then these sentences (both a non-marked 
and a marked-up variant) are sent to the partici-
pants who had by this time made a claim on their 
participation in the forum. The idea is to get pre-
liminary feedback to control all the previous de-
cisions that have been made about the forum dur-
ing the theoretical stage of the course. The par-
ticipants have the possibility to estimate the 
mark-up scheme and the assessment scheme and 
present some on-going results of this first small 
test. 
When we receive the first feedback from the par-
ticipants, we turn to the analysis of the system 
possible mistakes. Our aim at this stage is not to 
evaluate the systems but to exclude all cases 
which are either theoretically unclear (i.e. the 
head of the conjunction group) or cannot be re-
solved by the system (a ?boy sees the girl with 
the telescope? problem) or too difficult to unify 
(i.e. choice of the basic infinitive for Russian 
aspectual verbal pairs). 
All this activities need special clarification: Rus-
sian is a so called ?poor resource? language. The 
forum cannot use existing corpora as a training 
set. This can violate the independence of evalua-
tion results: some of the system had been trained 
on these corpora while others had not. So the 
main practice of our evaluation forums is to con-
duct assessment on a Gold Standard subcorpus 
which normally includes about 800 randomly 
selected sentences that have been manually 
tagged. Meanwhile the routine of manual tagging 
serves as an important practical exercise for stu-
dents. 
4 The round-table 
The closing event of the first year is a round-
table, held at the annual conference on computa-
tional linguistics ?Dialogue? (www.dialogue-
21.ru). The presentation is prepared and done 
mostly by students and contains all the topics 
that had been worked on during the previous pe-
riod: all important background, proposals on the 
forum scenario and the result of the first evalua-
tion experiment. Usually most of the participants 
take active part in the round-table. This is be-
sides all an exciting experience for students that 
have an opportunity to make acquaintance with 
researches from academy and industry, the op-
portunity that can have far-reaching effect for 
their future career. After the round table the work 
on the second part ? the evaluation itself begins. 
5 The Gold Standard mark-up stage 
The Gold Standard preparation stage includes: 
the final version of annotator instruction work-
out, the tool for Gold Standard mark-up choice 
or creation, Gold Standard annotators disagree-
ment cases discussion, the final version of Gold 
Standard creation. 
For the Syntax and Anaphora forum the spe-
cial tools were created for Gold Standard Mark-
up. These tools are suitable for annotators deci-
sion comparison (Gareyshina et al, 2012). The 
design of the tool was a special issue for discus-
sion during the class. 
The Gold Standard is tagged manually using 
the worked-out tagging tool. Each item (word, 
sentence, text (coreference chain)) is inde-
pendently tagged by two experts-students, then 
divergences are discussed, if any, and the com-
mon decision is made. Each pair of students is 
responsible for the common decision in case of 
discrepancy. The discrepancies in pairs are writ-
ten out in a special document. The students final-
ly work out the list of problematic cases for the 
corresponding NLP tasks both from the point of 
view of theory and practical decisions, e.g. the 
typical morphological ambiguity cases such as 
Verbal Adjective vs. Participle for Russian or 
problems of Syntactic relation direction in case 
of Numeral-Noun syntactic relation, etc. The 
cases are discussed during seminars. Thus the 
annotator instruction is improved. Then the an-
notation is checked by the third expert (one of 
the tutors). Such procedure allowed us to achieve 
three aims. It helped to work out the algorithm 
for semi-automate annotators? mistakes detection 
procedure. Then, we wanted to avoid ?overfit-
ting?: getting the experts used to common error 
of the specific system and omitting errors by not 
noticing them. And last, tagging is supposed to 
give the experts the basic knowledge about diffi-
cult cases and to help them form criteria for 
evaluating mismatches.

6 The evaluation procedure 
The stage of evaluation includes the creation a 
special tool for systems responses comparison 
with Gold Standard, the comparison of the output 
of the parsers to the Gold Standard. 
The test sets usually are based on a Treebank 
used for the development of the parsers. In our 
case there was no Gold Standard Treebank for 
Russian and there is no Gold Standard Corpora 
with coreference mark-up. Moreover each sys-
tem has its own theoretical and practical deci-
sions due to the final purposes of the system.  
The students? activity during this stage in-
cludes: the automatic comparison tool creation 
(this is a task for a ?programming-oriented? stu-
dents), the special editor for system responses 
comparison creation, the manual procedure of 
system mismatches with Gold Standard analysis. 
The latter is an essential stage for Evaluation. 
As it was mentioned above there are systems? 
mismatches that should not be treated as mis-
takes. Thus this procedure includes the collective 
decision for a repertory of marks used by the an-
notators for differentiating cases of mismatches, 
the mismatches discussion during joint seminars, 
the mismatches manual assessment. All teams of 
assessors (two students and a tutor) have their 
own piece of a Gold Standard Corpora to check. 
Thus every team faces all kinds of difficulties; 
this principle provides the united consistent ap-
proach to all the types of discrepancies. 
7 Teaching Methods and Schedule 
The Forum cycle takes one and a half of aca-
demic years. Thus we have a series of three Spe-
cial seminars in one of the NLP fields. Students 
could take part in all the stages of a Forum or 
only in one of them. The first part is mainly theo-
retical. They deepen their knowledge in theoreti-
cal approaches to linguistic analysis; get ac-
quainted with the approaches to the correspond-
ing NLP task. The other useful activities is a 
NLP software testing, the real systems discrep-
ancy analysis. The course is also good opportuni-
ty to train academic reading skill. The compari-
son of systems outputs and the work out of Fo-
rum parameters are good hands-on tasks. This 
course is also a challenge for students to learn 
out how the theoretical principles interact with 
practical system requirements.  
The second course is a practical one. Its pri-
mary aim is to work out and annotate the Gold 
Standard Corpus. Thus this activity could be 
treated as a series of hands-on in classroom to-
gether with exhaustive home-tasks. The course is 
a project work in a team where IT-oriented stu-
dents and linguistically-oriented students work 
together. The practical result is an opened re-
source such as Syntax Treebank consisting of 
800 sentences manually tagged. One of the im-
portant educational outputs of the seminar is the 
acquaintance with the repertory of the problemat-
ic cases in a certain NLP field of study. 
The Third course is also practical one. Besides 
the practical tasks of Systems mismatches evalu-
ation this course also allows students to improve 
their Academic writing skills. The output of this 
course is not only the Systems evaluation as it is 
but a scientific article describing the whole Fo-
rum procedure as well. 
8 Conclusions 
The described above students activity as the or-
ganizers of the Evaluation Forum, annotators and 
assessors has challenges for NLP education the 
enumerated below. 
The ?outputs? for theoretical stage are the fol-
lowing: 
? the high-targeted, and thus highly moti-
vated and deep acquaintance with the ap-
proaches to the NLP tasks, existing re-
sources in other languages, methods of 
evaluation; 
? the academic reading skills in NLP re-
search field; 
? the acquaintance with the different princi-
ple of adaptation the linguistic theory to 
the NLP task implementation. 
The practical-skill training output: 
? the annotation skill 
? the academic reading and writing skill 
? the NLP evaluation skill 
? the inter-discipline team-working. 
As it has been mentioned, ironically, the re-
source poverty is a challenge for NLP education 
with Russian language in focus. At start the pro-
cedure of a particular NLP evaluation task for 
Russian is a terra incognita. Before the Forum 
starts the number and entry list of participants 
(and thus the competing technologies) are not 
predictable.  Doing something, that nobody has 
done before, is always a superb motivation for 
student involvement.
