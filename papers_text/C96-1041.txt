Abstract  
Probabilistic models have been widely 
used for natural language processing. 
Part-of-speech tagging, which assigns 
the most likely tag to each word in a 
given sentence, is one. of tire problems 
which can be solved by statisticM ap- 
proach. Many researchers haw~ tried 
to solve the problem by hidden Marker 
model (HMM), which is well known as 
one of the statistical models. But it 
has many difficulties: integrating hetero- 
geneous information, coping with data 
sparseness prohlem, and adapting to new 
environments. In this paper, we pro- 
pose a Markov radom field (MRF) model 
based approach to the tagging problem. 
The MRF provides the base frame to 
combine various statistical information 
with maximum entropy (ME) method. 
As Gibbs distribution can be used to 
describe a posteriori probability of tag- 
ging, we use it in ma.ximum a posteri- 
ori (MAP) estimation of optimizing pro- 
cess. Besides, several tagging models are 
developed to show the effect of adding 
information. Experimental results show 
that the performance of the tagger gets 
improved as we add more statistical in- 
formation, and that Mt{F-based tagging 
model is better than ttMM based tagging 
model in data sparseness problem. 
1 Int roduct ion  
Part-of-speech tagging is to assign the correct tag 
to each word in the context of the sentence. '\['here 
are three main approaches in tagging problem: 
rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons 1%3; 
Brodda 1982; Paulussen and Martin 1992; Brill 
et al 1990), statistical approach (Church :1988; 
Merialdo 1994; Foster 1991; Weischedel et al 
1993; Kupiec 1992) and connectionist approach 
(Benello et al 1989; Nakanmra et al 1989). In 
these approaches, tatistical approach as the fol- 
lowing advantages : 
? a theoretical framework is provided 
? automatic learning facility is provided 
? the probabilities provide a straightforward 
way to disambiguate 
Many information sources must be combined to 
solve tagging problem with statistical approach. 
It is a significant assumption that tire correct tag 
can generally be chosen from I.he local context. 
Not only local sequences of words and tags are 
needed to solve tagging problem, but syntax, se- 
mantic, and morphological level information is also 
required in general. Usually information sources 
such as t)igram, trigram and migra.m are used in 
the tagging systems which are based on statistical 
method. Traditionally, linear interpolation an(t its 
variants have been used to combine the informa- 
tion sources, })tit these are shown to be seriously 
deficient. 
ME (Maximum Entropy) estimation method 
provides the facility to combine several informa- 
tion sources. Each inR)rmation source gives rise 
to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the con> 
bined estimate. The function with the highest en- 
tropy within the constraints is the ME solution. 
Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique M E 
solution is guaranteed to exist and an iteratiw~" al- 
gorithm is provided. 
MRF (Marker random field) model is based on 
ME method and it; has the facility to combine 
many inlbrmation sources through feature flmc- 
tions. MRF model has the following adwmtages: 
robustness, adaptability, parallelism and the facil- 
ity of combining informatiort sources. M RF-based 
tagging model inherits these advantages. 
In this paper, we will present one of the statis- 
tical models, namely MRF-based tagging systern. 
We will show that several information sources in- 
cluding unigram, bigram and trigram, can be com- 
bined in MRF-based tagging model. Experimen- 
tal results show that the MRF-based tagger has 
very good performance specially when training 
data size is small.

where A1 + A2 = 1. Tire parameter l land A2 
can be estimated by forward-backward algorithm 
(Deroua86+) (Charniak93+)(tIUANG90+). 
Linear interpolation is so advantageous because 
it reconciles the different information sources in a 
straightforward and simple-minded way. But such 
simpliticy is also the source of its weaknesses: 
? Linearly interpolated information is generally 
inconsistent with their information sources 
because information sources are heteroge- 
neous for each other in general. 
? Linear interpolation does not make optimal 
combination of information sources. 
? Linear interpolation has over-estimation 
problem because it adjusts the model on the 
training data only and has no policy for un- 
trained data. This problem occur seriously 
when the size of the training data is not large 
enough. 
4.2 ME(max lmum ent ropy)  pr inc ip le  
There is very powerful estimation method 
which combines information sonrces objectively. 
ME(maximum entropy) principle (,laynes57) pro- 
vides the method to combine information sources 
consistently and the ability to overcome over- 
estimation problem by maximizing entropy of the 
domain with which the training data do not pro- 
vide information. 
Let us describe ME principle briefly. For given 
x, the quantity x is capable of assuming the dis- 
crete wdues xi, (i = 1, 2, ..., n). We are not given 
the corresponding probabilities pi; all we know is 
tire expectation value of the function f,.(x), (r = 
1, 2, ..., m): 
;q 
E\[fr(x)\] = Ep i (x i ) f , . (x i )  (1l) 
i=1 
On the basis of this information, how can we 
determine the probability value of the function 
pi(x)? At first glance, the problem seems insol- 
uble because the given information is insufficient 
to determine the probabilities pi(x). 
We call the function f,. (xi) a constraint function 
or fealure. Given consistent constraints, a unique 
ME soluton is guaranteed to exist and to be of the 
form: 
where the Ar's are some nnknown constants to 
be found. This formula is derived by maximizing 
the entropy of the probability distribution Pi as 
satisfying all the constraint given, qb search the 
l,.'s that make pi(x) satisfy all tile constraints, an 
external 
observation:

(12) is similar to Gibbs distribution, which 
is the primary probability distribution of M\[{F 
model. MRF model uses ME principle in combin- 
ing information sources and parameter estimation. 
We will describe MRFF model and its parameter 
estimation method later. 
5 MRF-based  tagg ing  model  
5.1 MRF in tagging 
Neighborhood of given random variable is defined 
by the set of random variables that directly atfect 
the given random variable. Let N(i) denote a set 
of random variables which are neighbors of ith 
random variable. Let's define the neighborhood 
system with distance L in tagging fbr words W = 
wl, ..., w,~, and tags T = h ,  ..., t,~. 
N(i) = { i -  L , . . . , i -  1, i+ l , . . . , i+ L} (13) 
This neighborhood system has on(; dimensional 
relation and describes the one dimenstional struc- 
ture of sentence. Fig. 1 showes MP~F T which is 
defined for the neighborhood system with distance 
2. The arrows represent that the random variable 
ti is affected by the neighbors ti- 2, ti- 1, ti+ t, ~j+'~. 
It also showes that t i , t i - t  and ti,ti+l have the 
neighborhood relation connected by bigram, and 
that t i , t i - l , t i -2  and ti,ti+l,ti+2 have ttm neigh- 
borhood relation connected by trigram. 
A clique is defined as the set of random vari- 
ables that all of the pairs of random variables are 
neighborhood in it. Let's define the clique as the 
tag sequence with size L in tagging problem. 
G = {ti-L,ti-(t,-1), ...,ti} (14) 
A clique concept is used to define clique fimction 
that evaluates current state of random variables in 
clique. 
The definition of MRF is presented as following. 
Definil~ion of MI{F: Random 'variable T is 
Markov random field if T' salisfies the follow- 
ing two properties.

ties the positivity and the locality. 
5.2 A Poster io r i  Prot iat i i l l ty  
A posteriori probat)ility is needed to sea.rcb for 
the Jrlost, likely tag sequence. M II, F provides the 
i;heoretical bi~cliground about the probal)ility of 
the system (Bes~tg74) ((leiJfla, ii84+).

Morphok)gical evel information helps tagger to 
determine the tag of the word, more. especially 
of the unknown word. The suffix of a word gives 
very useful information about the tag of the word 
in F, nglish. The (:li(ltte function of model 2 is de- 
lined as

We used the statistical distribution of the sixty

There exist error prone words in every ta.gging sys-

the. error results and adding more inforniation of

adjusting errors in word level.

The process of selecting the best tag sequence 
is called ms optimization process. We use MAP 
(Maximum A l)osteriori) estiniation method.  The 
tag sequence 7' is selected to niaximize the a pos- 
teriori probM)ility of tagging (19) by MAP. 
Simulated annealing is used to searcti the op- 
timal tag sequence as Gibbs distribution provides
