Abstract: 
A Bilingual Knowledge Bank is a syntactically and 
referentially structured pair of corpora, one being a 
translation of the other, in which translation units are 
cross-codexl between the corpora. A pilot implemen- 
tation is described for a corpus of some 20,000 words 
each in English, French and Esperanto which has been 
cross-coded between English and Esperanto and 
between Esperanto and French. The aim is to develop 
a corpus-based general-purpose knowledge source for 
applications in machine translation and computer- 
aided translation. 
1. Introduction 
HmTis (1988) has called for a "hyper-bitext" ool for 
professional translators, a tool which would permit 
them easy on-line retrieval of bilingual equivalences, 
or "translation units", they have used in the past. The 
translator's previous output would be stored as hyper- 
text, with the parallel texts as far as possible aligned. 
A search for a given expression or term would thus 
display, for each occurrence in the corpus, a chunk of 
source language context ogett:er with the correspond- 
ing fragment in the target language. 
At the same time, but independently, the authors 
and their colleagues at BSO/Research have been 
experimenting with bilingual corpora as a potential 
knowledge source for the Distributed Language Trans- 
lation system (for an overview of this machine transla- 
tion project, see Witkam 1988). They have argued 
that a bilingual corpus, appropriately structured, can 
largely replace conventional dictionaries (Sadler 1989: 
133) and grammar rules (van Zuijlen 1989) in 
machine translation. The aim is to automate as far as 
possible the acquisition of the various types of 
knowledge required for machine translation - from 
monolingual knowledge of morphology, word classes, 
syntactic structures etc., through bilingual knowledge 
of lexical equivalences and translation syntax, to 
purely extra-linguistic knowledge-of-the-world - by 
structuring the evidence xplicitly and implicitly avail- 
able in human translations. Tim structured bilingual 
corpus is trained a "Bilingual Knowledge Bank", or 
BKB. It appears that the tools now under develop- 
ment for constructing a BKB may also provide the 
professional translator with a more sophisticated form 
of "hyper-bitext" han that envisaged by Harris. 
2. Building a Bilingual Knowledge Bank 
There are basically three steps involved in building a 
BKB structure. First, each hmguage version must be 
structured syntactically if it is to serve as a source of 
(monolingual nd contmstive) grammatical knowledge. 
Second, semantically equivalent units (translation 
units) must be identified and cross-linked between the 
two versions. Third, referential or conceptual links 
must be added to identify various types of deixis and 
co-reference. The process can be illustrated with the 
following English-French example from Harris (1988).

The Distributed Language Translation project has 
adopted dependency, rather than constituency, syntax 
(Schubert 1987; Maxwell & Schubert 1989), and fig- 
ure 1 shows the dependency trees for this example, 
cross-coded for translation units (TUs). Each ellipse 
corresponds to a subtree. The basic TUs are depen- 
dency (sub)trees. Each of the seven subtrees which 
are directly identifiable as translation units has been 
assigned an identification number.

Table 1 lists the TU numbers with the correspond- 
ing equivalences. For example, Ti.J 1 identifies the 
complete sentence~ TU 2 is the subject noun phrase, 3 
the determiner, 4 the prepositional phrase, etc. While 
each of the basic translation units corresponds to a 
(sub)tree, not every subtree con'esponds to a transla- 
tton unit. The French subtree governed by dans, for 
instance, does not constitute a translation unit, In the 
TU coding, this is shown by the identification "1/2" 
attached to dans, which indicates that this subtree is 
the second bound dependent in TU 1.

The subtree approach to translation units allows for 
a process of tree subtraction which amounts to a kind 
of generalization. This allows the productive use of 
all the equivalences in the text, even if they do not 
con:;timte independent subtrees. For example, sub- 
trac!ing TUs 2 and 6 from TU 1 in figure 1 yields the 
C,.luivalence of to ,o~animoudy co~firm with &re 
io,ar~izze dans sa cor?grmation de. In a machine 
Iranslation application, TUs 2 and 6 can be thought of 
as variables in a productive translation rule. Table 2 
lists tt-e remaining possibilities and the corresponding 
subtractions. Once the basic TUs have been identi- 
fied, these other equivalences can be atttomatically de- 
duced by tree subtraction.

The rcmaini~g s~ep in BKB construction is the 
coding of references. In figure 1, TU 6 ( the mandate 
= le mae~dat) will be linked by a pointer to its an- 
tecedent in a previous entence. This link is bilingual, 
but other references may be language-specific. For 
example, the possessive pronoun in the French Sen- 
tence has no correspondent in the English version, as 
shown by the coding "1/4" in figure 1. Nevertheless, 
a monolingual link must be established between sa 
(or its normalized form so~,) and the antecedent, 
which can be identified as unit 2 ( le conseil du 
PAC). 
i~,tc;:.mr~cc!ing .'.he various surface forms used to 
:~e,,pr ~., .: ~,_.a coa~ccpt multiplies, for any given sur- 
face form, the contextual constraints which can be 
derived from the BKB, e.g. for the purposes of au- 
tomatic disambiguation. It also "allows the BKB struc- 
ture to be reg~rded as a type of knowledge representa- 
tion to which inference rules can be applied (Sadler 
1989: 149-233). 
The building of a Bilingual Knowledge Bank en- 
tails a great deal of interactive text processing. Even 
after the text in each language has been correctly 
parsed, the conversion of the parallel deixmdency trees 
to the BKB structure cannot be performed automati- 
cally. However, it does appear that a great deal of the 
work can become automatic. There are two reasons 
for this. First, the BKB itself can provide more and 
more support, in a kind of boot-strapping process, the 
larger it becomes. Second, the information contained 
in one language version can support he disambigua- 
tion of the other version. 
3. The pilot implementation 
in order to serve as a general provider of linguistic 
and world knowledge, a BKB should contain large 
amounts of data. When considering time-critical BKB 
applications, uch as the BKB within a machine trans- 
lation system, it is clear that efficient data storage 
techniques arc needed. Of course, it is not possible to 
investigate BKB techniques on a very large scale at 
present, because it takes a relatively long time to pro- 
cess the corpus. For this reason a small-scale imple- 
mentation has been designed which gives a good im- 
pression of a future large-scale BKB system. The 
basis for this pilot BKB is formed by three parallel 
20,000-word text corpora in the field of computer 
manuals. From these corpora, two BKBs have been 
built: one for English/Esperanto, the other for 
French/Esperanto. The pilot implementation consists 
of three, main parts: the parser, the "synsemizer" and 
the retrieval system. 
The parser is used to parse each input text. Since 
each sentence which is stored in the BKB should have 
only one meaning (i.e., should contain no syntactic 
~unbiguities), the parser yields only one analysis per 
sentence. This deterministic behaviour is produced by 
a simple category-based grammar on the one hand, 
and built-in mechanisms which take care of coordina- 
tion, ellipsis and uncertain syntagma ttachments on 
the other hand. The analysis found is presented 
graphically to the user, and can be edited as required 
before it is stored in the BKB. Words are stored in 
their normalized forms with categories and some basic 
syntactic features. The parsing process is BKB- 
supported: with each new sentence, the information 
that was stored earlier is used to give clues to 
categories, features and normalized forms. Besides 
this learning capability, a future BKB system will also 
use the structure of sentences already par.~ed to 
resolve attachment problems that the parser was un- 
able to resolve. 
The synsemizer is used both to define translation 
units by establishing bilingual relations between 
corresponding monolingmd subtrees, and to establish 
monolingual referential relationships. The first part of 
the work is presented to the user graphically: the com- 
puter searches for probable TU constituents and 
displays them for the user's confirmation or correc- 
tion. Subsequent proposals are influenced by the 
user's response. The system is self-improving, since 
the computer's guesses are based on the whole of the 
text processed so far. Referential relations must be 
450  2 
identified manually in this pilot implementation. 
However, since bilingual relations (TUs) have already 
been established before this process begins, there is 
additional information available to aid the operator. 
The retrieval system is a tool which extracts in- 
formation from a BKB that has been built using the 
parser and the synsemizer. On lthe basis of input 
phrases, which can be augmented with syntactic infor- 
mation, the BKB is queried. The resulting answers are 
presenteA to the user, either graphically or textually. 
Possible queries include concordance queries, transla- 
tion and back-translation queries, and - to some ex- 
tent - bridge translation (e.g. simulated English-to- 
French translation via Esperanto by "chaining" the 
two available BKBs). 
An interesting aspect of this pilot implementation 
is that it is not just a simplified prototype system in 
which decisions about various difficult issues are post- 
poned. On the contrary, it contains the required func- 
tionality for building a real large-scale BKB. Any 
weaknesses of the pilot system derive from its limited 
size and from inefficiencies in implementation, rather 
than from its functionality. The system can therefore 
be used for examining various extrapolation-directed 
aspects such as linguistic and technical applicability, 
consistency mechanisms and also user interface 
presentation atthe BKB building stage. 
4, Comparison with other research 
The corpus-based approach to dictionary acquisition, 
which is part of the motivation behind the Bilingual 
Knowledge Bank, should not be confused with at- 
tempts made elsewhere to derive lexical equivalences 
from a bilingual corpus by purely probabilistic means 
(e.g. Brown et al 1988). Syntactic structure is an 
essential BKB ingredient. Sumita & Tsutsumi (1988) 
have implemented a database of equivalent sentences 
in Japanese and English, but no full syntactic parsing 
is done, and retrieval is based on Patterns of function 
words in the Japanese text. In their tool, sentences re- 
trieved in bilingual form serve merely as models for 
the human translator. Another translation aid has 
been described and implemented by Kjzersgaard 
(1987). This system allows the translator to retrieve a 
key word from one half of a bilingual corpus, together 
with its context in the source language and the 
corresponding chunk of text in the target language. It 
is up to the user, however, to decide which, if any, is 
the equivalent expression in the target language 
chunk. 
The closest comparable research appears to be that 
of Ogura et al (1989), who have structured some 
40,000 words of running text in Japanese and English 
in what they term a "linguistic database". This does 
comprise a hierarchical syntactic and text-level struc- 
ture, as well as cross-references between equivalent 
expressions in the two languages, although it is not 
clear whether all translation units have been coded. 
Their primary aim is to provide a friendly interface 
for the linguist, answering queries on word-class 
statistics, displaying the context and translations of 
key expressions, etc. In contrast, the present research 
is directly primarily towards applications in machine 
translation. 
5. Conclusions 
As compared with traditional methods of lexicography 
and the writing of conventional gramm~ rules, this 
corpus-based approach takes advantage of the fact that 
vast amounts of human translation expertise are readi- 
ly accessible in readable form. Instead of extracting 
vocabulary and grammar ules fl:om text, the method 
described structures the text in such a way that the 
knowledge is directly accessible in the text itself. The 
BKB is a completely symmetrical construction, in 
which no distinction is made between source and tar- 
get languages. The (virtual) dictionary and rule sys- 
tem it comprises are thus 100% reversible.
