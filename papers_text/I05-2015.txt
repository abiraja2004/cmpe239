Abstract 
We are constricting a Japanese-Chinese 
parallel corpus, which is a part of the 
NICT Multilingual Corpora. The corpus is 
general domain, of large scale of about 
40,000 sentence pairs, long sentences, 
annotated with detailed information and 
high quality. To the best of our knowledge, 
this will be the first annotated Japanese-
Chinese parallel corpus in the world. We 
created the corpus by selecting Japanese 
sentences from Mainichi Newspaper and 
then manually translating them into 
Chinese. We then annotated the corpus 
with morphological and syntactic 
structures and alignments at word and 
phrase levels. This paper describes the 
specification in human translation and the 
scheme of detailed information annotation, 
and the tools we developed in the corpus 
construction. The experience we obtained 
and points we paid special attentions are 
also introduced for share with other 
researches in corpora construction.     
1 Introduction 
A parallel corpus is a collection of articles, 
paragraphs, or sentences in two different languages. 
Since a parallel corpus contains translation 
correspondences between the source text and its 
translations at different level of constituents, it is a 
critical resource for extracting translation 
knowledge in machine translation (MT). Although 
recently some versions of machine translation 
software have become available in the market, 
translation quality is still a significant problem. 
Therefore, a detailed examination into human 
translation is still required. This will provide a basis 
for radically improving machine translation in the 
near future. In addition, in MT system development, 
the example-based method and the statistics-based 
method are widely researched and applied. So, 
parallel corpora are required by the translation 
studies and practical system development.   
The raw text of a parallel corpus contains 
implicit knowledge. If we annotate some 
information, we can get explicit knowledge from 
the corpus. The more information that is annotated 
on a parallel corpus, the more knowledge we can 
get from the corpus. The parallel corpora of 
European languages are usually raw texts without 
annotation on syntactic structure since their 
syntactic structures are similar and MT does not 
require such annotation information. However, 
when language pairs are different in syntactic 
structures, such as the pair of English and Japanese 
and the pair of Japanese and Chinese, 
transformation between syntactic structures is 
difficult. A parallel corpus annotated with syntactic 
structures would thus be helpful to MT.  Besides 
MT, an annotated parallel corpus can be applied to 
cross-lingual information retrieval, language 
teaching, machine-aided translation, bilingual 
lexicography, and word-sense disambiguation.  
Parallel corpora between European languages 
are well developed and are available through the 
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). However, 
parallel corpora between European languages and 
Asian languages are less developed, and parallel 
corpora between two Asian languages are even less 
developed.  
The National Institute of Information and 
Communications Technology therefore started a 
project to build multilingual parallel corpora in 
2002 (Uchimoto et al, 2004). The project focuses 
on Asian language pairs and annotation of detailed 
information, including syntactic structure and 
alignment at word and phrase levels. We call the 
corpus the NICT Multilingual Corpora. The corpus 
will be open to the public in the near future. 
2 Overview of the NICT Multilingual 
Corpora 
At present, a Japanese-English parallel corpus and a 
Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus are under 
construction following systematic specifications. 
The parallel texts in each corpus consist of the 
original text in the source language and its 
translations in the target language. The original data 
is from newspaper articles or journals, such as 
85
Mainichi Newspaper in Japanese. The original 
articles were translated by skilled translators. In 
human translation, the articles of one domain were 
all assigned to the same translators to maintain 
consistent terminology in the target language. 
Different translators then revised the translated 
articles. Each article was translated one sentence to 
one sentence, so the obtained parallel corpora are 
already sentence aligned.  
  The details of the current version of the NICT 
Multilingual Corpora are listed in Table 1.

C: ?????????????????????

In addition to the human translation, another big 
task is annotating the information. We finish the 
task by two steps: automatic annotation and human 
revision. In automatic annotation, we applied 
existing analysis techniques and tag sets. In human 
revision, we developed assisting tools that have 
powerful functions to help annotators in revision. 
The annotation task for each language included 
morphological and syntactic structure annotation.  
The annotation task for each language pair included 
alignments at word and phrase level.  
The NICT Multilingual Corpora constructed in 
this way have the following characteristics. 
(1) Since the original data is from newspaper and 
journals, the domain of each corpus is therefore rich.  
(2) Each corpus consists of original sentences and 
their translations, so they are already sentence 
aligned. In translation of each sentence, the context 
of the article is also considered. Thus, the context of 
each original article is also well maintained in its 
translation, which can be exploited in the future. 
(3) The corpora are annotated at high quality with 
morphological and syntactic structures and 
word/phrase alignment.  
 In the following section, we will describe the 
details in the construction of the Japanese-Chinese 
parallel corpus. 
3 Human Translation from Japanese to 
Chinese   
About 40,000 Japanese sentences from issues of 
Mainichi Newspaper were translated by skilled 
translators. The translation guidelines were as 
follows. 
(1) One Japanese sentence is translated into one 
Chinese sentence. 
(2) Among several translation candidates, the one 
that is close to the original sentence in syntactic 
structure is preferred. The aim is to avoid 
translating a sentence too freely, i.e., 
paraphrasing. 
(3) To obtain intelligible Chinese translations, 
information of the proceeding sentences in the 
same article should be added. Especially, a 
subject should be supplemented because a 
subject is usually required in Chinese, while in 
Japanese subjects are often omitted . 
(4)  To obtain natural Chinese translations, 
supplement, deletion, replacement, and 
paraphrase  should be made when necessary. 
When a translation is very long, word order can 
be changed or commons can be inserted. These 
are the restrictions on (2), i.e., the naturalness 
of the Chinese translations is the priority.  
 
  One problem in translation is how to translate 
proper nouns in the newspaper articles. We pay 
special attentions to them in the following way.  
(1) Proper nouns  
When proper nouns did not exist in Japanese-
Chinese dictionaries, new translations were created 
and then confirmed using the Chinese web. For 
kanji in proper nouns, if there was a Chinese 
character having the same orthography as the kanji, 
the Chinese character was used in the Chinese 
translation; if there was a traditional Chinese 
character having the same orthography as the kanji, 
the simplified character of the traditional Chinese 
character was used in the translation; otherwise, a 
Chinese character whose orthography is similar to 
that of the kanji was used in the translation.  
(2) Special things in Japan 
86
 Explanations were added if necessary. For example, 
?????, translated from ????? (grand sumo 
tournament), is well known in China, while ????, 
translated from ???? (spring labor offensive), is 
not known in China. In this case, an explanation 
???????? was added behind the unfamiliar 
term. We attempt to introduce new words about 
Japanese culture into Chinese through the 
construction of the corpus.    
 
   Producing high-quality Chinese translations is 
crucial to this parallel corpus. We controlled the 
quality by the following treatments.  
(1) The first revision of a translated article was 
conducted by a different translator after the first 
translation. The reviewers checked whether the 
meanings of the Chinese translations corresponded 
accurately to the meanings of the original sentences 
and modified the Chinese translations if necessary. 
(2) The second revision was conducted by Chinese 
natives without referring to the original sentences. 
The reviewers checked whether the Chinese 
translations were natural and passed the unnatural 
translations back to translators for modification. 
(3) The third revision was conducted by a Chinese 
native in the annotation process of Chinese 
morphological information. The words that did not 
exist in the dictionary of contemporary Chinese 
were checked to determine whether they were new 
words. If not, the words were designated as 
informal or not written language and were replaced 
with suitable words. The word sequences that 
missed the Chinese language model?s part-of-
speech chain were also adjusted.        
 
 Until now, 38,383 Japanese sentences have 
been translated to Chinese, and of those, 22,000 
Chinese translations have been revised three times, 
and we are still working on the remaining 18,000 
Chinese translations.  
4 Morphological Information Annotation 
Annotation consists of automatic analyses and 
manual revision. 
4.1 Annotation on Japanese Sentences  
Japanese morphological and syntactic analyses 
follow the definitions of part-of-speech categories 
and syntactic labels of the Corpus of Spontaneous 
Japanese (Maekawa, 2000).  
A morphological analyzer developed in that 
project was applied for automatic annotation on the 
Japanese sentences and then the automatically 
tagged sentences were revised manually. An 
annotated senetence is illustrated in Figure 1, which 
is the Japanese sentence in Ex. 1 in Section 2.

Figure 1. An annotated Japanese sentence 
 
The data of one sentence begins from the line ?# S-
ID... ? and ends with the mark ?EOJ?. The line 
headed by ?*? indicates the beginning of a phrase 
and the following lines are morphemes in that 
phrase. For example, the line ?* 0 2D? indicates the 
phrase whose number is 0. The following line ???
??  ? ? ? ?  * ? ?  * * *? indicates the 
morpheme in the phrase. There are seven fields in 
each morpheme line, token form, phonetic alphabet, 
dictionary form, part-of-speech, sub-part-of-speech, 
verbal category and conjugation form. In the line ?* 
0 2D?, the numeral 2 in ?2D? indicates that the 
phrase 0 ?????? modifies the phrase 2 ???
? ? ?. The syntactic structure analysis adopts 
dependency-structure analysis in which modifier-
modified relations between phrases are determined. 
The dependency-structure of the example in Figure 
1 is demonstrated in Figure 2.

4.2 Annotation on Chinese Sentences 
For Chinese morphological analysis, we used the 
analyser developed by Peking University, where the 
research on definition of Chinese words and the 
criteria of word segmentation has been conducted 
for over ten years. The achievements include a 
grammatical knowledge base of contemporary 
Chinese, an automatic morphological analyser, and 
an annotated People?s Daily Corpus. Since the 
definition and tagset are widely used in Chinese 
language processing, we also took the criteria as the 
basis of our guidelines.  
A morphological analyzer developed by Peking 
University (Zhou and Yu, 1994) was applied for 
automatic annotation of the Chinese sentences and 
then the automatically tagged sentences were 
revised by humans. An annotated sentence is 
illustrated in Figure 3, which is the Chinese 
sentence in Ex. 1 in Section 2.

4.3 Tool for Manual Revision 
We developed a tool to assist annotators in revision. 
The tool has both Japanese and Chinese versions. 
Here, we introduce the Chinese version. The input 
of the tool is the automatically segmented and part-
of-speech tagged sentences and the output is revised 
data. The basic functions include separating a 
sequence of characters into two words, combining 
two segmented words into one word, and selecting 
a part-of-speech for a segmented word from a list of 
parts-of-speech. In addition, the tool has the 
following functions. 
(1) Retrieves a word in the grammatical knowledge 
base of contemporary Chinese of Peking University 
(Yu et al, 1997).  
This is convenient when annotators want to 
confirm whether a segmented word is authorized by 
the grammatical knowledge base, and when they 
want to know the parts-of-speech of a word defined 
by the grammatical knowledge base.  
(2) Retrieves a word in other annotated corpora or 
the sentences that have been revised.   
This is convenient when annotators want to see 
how the same word has been annotated before.  
(3) Retrieves a word in the current file.  
It collects all the sentences in the current file 
that contain the same word and then sorts their 
context on the left and right of the word. By 
referring to the sorted contexts, annotators can 
select words with the same syntactic roles and 
change all of the parts-of-speech to a certain one all 
in one operation. This is convenient when 
annotators want to process the same word in 
different sentences, aiming for consistency in 
annotation.     
(4) Adds new words to the grammatical knowledge 
base dynamically.  
The updated grammatical knowledge base can 
be used by the morphological analyser in the next 
analysis. 
(5) Indexes to sentences by an index file.  
The automatically discovered erroneous 
annotations can be stored in one index file, pointing 
to the sentences that are to be revised.  
 
The interface of the tool is shown in Figure 4 
and Figure 5. 
 
Figure 4 Interface of the manual revision tool (Retrieves 
a word in the grammatical knowledge base of 
contemporary Chinese) 
 
Figure 5    Interface of the manual revision tool 
(Retrieves a word in the current file) 
  
 
In Figure 4, the small window in the lower left 
displays the retrieved result of the word ? ??? in 
the grammatical knowledge base; the lower right 
window displays the retrieved result of the same 
word in the annotated People?s Daily Corpus. 
88
In Figure 5, the small window in the lower left is used to 
define retrieval conditions in the current file. In this 
example, the orthography of ???? is defined. The 
lower right window displays the sentences containing the 
word  ???? retrieved from the current file. The left and 
right contexts of one word are shown with the retrieved 
word. The contents of any column can be sorted by 
clicking the top line of the column. 
5 Annotation of word alignment  
Since automatic word alignment techniques cannot 
reach as high a level as the morphological analyses, 
we adopt a practical method of using multiple 
aligners. One aligner is a lexical knowledge-based 
approach, which was implemented by us based on 
the work of Ker (Ker and Chang, 1997). Another 
aligner is the well-known GIZA++ toolkit, which is 
a statistics-based approach. For GIZA++, two 
directions were adopted: the Chinese sentences 
were used as source sentences and the Japanese 
sentences as target sentences, and vice versa.  
The results produced by the lexical knowledge-
based aligner, C? J of GIZA++, and J?C of 
GIZA++ were selected in a majority decision. If an 
alignment result was produced by two or three 
aligners at the same time, the result was accepted. 
Otherwise, was abandoned.  In this way, we aimed 
to utilize the results of each aligner and maintain 
high precision at the same time. Table 2 showed the 
evaluation results of the multi-aligner on 1,127 test 
sentence pairs, which were manually annotated with 
gold standards, totally 17,332 alignments.

Table 2 Evaluation results of the multi-aligner 
  
The multi-aligner produced satisfactory results. 
This performance is evidence that the multi-aligner 
is feasible for use in assisting word alignment 
annotation.  
For manual revision, we also developed an 
assisting tool, which consist of a graphical interface 
and internal data management. Annotators can 
correct the output of the automatic aligner and add 
alignments that it has not identified. In addition to 
assisting with word alignment, the tool also 
supports annotation on phrase alignment. Since 
Japanese sentences have been annotated with phrase 
structures, annotators can select each phrase on the 
Japanese side and then align them with words on 
the Chinese side. For idioms in Japanese sentences, 
two or more phrases can be selected. 
The input and output file of the manual 
annotation is in XML format. The data of one 
sentence pair consists of the Chinese sentence 
annotated with morphological information, the 
Japanese sentence annotated with morphological 
and syntactic structure information, word alignment, 
and phrase alignment.  
The alignment annotation at word and phrase is 
ongoing, the former focusing on lexical translations 
and the latter focusing on pattern translations. After 
a certain amount of data is annotated, we plan to 
exploit the annotated data to improve the 
performance of automatic word alignment. We will 
also investigate a method to automatically identify 
phrase alignments from the annotated word 
alignment and a method to automatically discover 
the syntactic structures on the Chinese side from the 
annotated phrase alignments.       
6 Conclusion  
We have described the construction of a Japanese-
Chinese parallel corpus, a part of the NICT 
Multilingual Corpus. The corpus consists of about 
40,000 pairs of Japanese sentences and their 
Chinese translations. The Japanese sentences are 
annotated with morphological and syntactic 
structures and the Chinese sentences are annotated 
with morphological information. In addition, word 
and phrase alignments are annotated. A high quality 
of annotation was obtained through manual 
revisions, which were greatly assisted by the 
revision tools we developed in the project. To the 
best of our knowledge, this will be the first 
annotated Japanese-Chinese parallel corpus in the 
world.  
In the future, we will finish the annotation on the 
remaining data and add syntactic structures to the 
Chinese sentences.
