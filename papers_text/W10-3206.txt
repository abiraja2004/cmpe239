Abstract
This paper presents on-going work on
constructing bilingual multimodal corpora
of referring expressions in collaborative
problem solving for English and Japanese.
The corpora were collected from dia-
logues in which two participants collab-
oratively solved Tangram puzzles with
a puzzle simulator. Extra-linguistic in-
formation such as operations on puzzle
pieces, mouse cursor position and piece
positions were recorded in synchronisa-
tion with utterances. The speech data
was transcribed and time-aligned with the
extra-linguistic information. Referring
expressions in utterances that refer to puz-
zle pieces were annotated in terms of their
spans, their referents and their other at-
tributes. The Japanese corpus has already
been completed, but the English counter-
part is still undergoing annotation. We
have conducted a preliminary comparative
analysis of both corpora, mainly with re-
spect to task completion time, task suc-
cess rates and attributes of referring ex-
pressions. These corpora showed signif-
icant differences in task completion time
and success rate.
1 Introduction
A referring expression (RE) is a linguistic de-
vice that refers to a certain object of interest (e.g.
used in describing where the object is located in
space). REs have attracted a great deal of atten-
tion in both language analysis and language gen-
eration research. In language analysis research,
reference resolution, particularly anaphora resolu-
tion (Mitkov, 2002), has a long research history as
far back as the mid-1970s (Hobbs, 1978). Much
research has been conducted from both theoretical
and empirical perspectives, mainly concerning the
identification of antecedents or entities mentioned
within the same text. This trend, targeting refer-
ence resolution in written text, is still dominant in
the language analysis, perhaps because such tech-
niques are intended for use in applications such as
information extraction.
In contrast, in language generation research in-
terest has recently shifted from the generation of
one-off references to entities to generation of REs
in discourse context (Belz et al, 2010) and inves-
tigating human referential behaviour in real world
situations, with the aim of using such techniques
in applications like human-robot interaction (Pi-
wek, 2007; Foster et al, 2008; Bard et al, 2009).
In both analysis and generation, machine-
learning approaches have come to replace rule-
based approaches as the predominant research
trend since the 1990s. This trend has made anno-
tated corpora an indispensable component of re-
search for training and evaluating proposed meth-
ods. In fact, research on reference resolution has
developed significantly as a result of large scale
corpora, e.g. those provided by the Message Un-
derstanding Conference (MUC)1 and the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE)2 project. These
corpora were constructed primarily for informa-
tion extraction research, thus were annotated with
co-reference relations within texts. Also in the
language generation community, several corpora
1http://www.nlpir.nist.gov/related projects/muc/
2http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/tests/ace/
38
have been developed (Di Eugenio et al, 2000; By-
ron, 2005; van Deemter et al, 2006; Foster and
Oberlander, 2007; Foster et al, 2008; Stoia et al,
2008; Spanger et al, 2009a; Belz et al, 2010).
Unlike the corpora of MUC and ACE, many are
collected from situated dialogues, and therefore
include multimodal information (e.g. gestures and
eye-gaze) other than just transcribed text (Martin
et al, 2007). Foster and Oberlander (2007) em-
phasised that any corpus for language generation
should include all possible contextual information
at the appropriate granularity. Since constructing
a dialogue corpus generally requires experiments
for data collection, this kind of corpus tends to be
small-scale compared with corpora for reference
resolution.
Against this background, we have been de-
veloping multimodal corpora of referring expres-
sions in collaborative problem-solving settings.
This paper presents on-going work of construct-
ing bilingual (English and Japanese) comparable
corpora in this domain. We achieve our goal by
replicating, for the English corpus, the same pro-
cess of data collection and annotation as we used
for our existing Japanese corpus (Spanger et al,
2009a). Our aim is to create bilingual multimodal
corpora collected from dialogues in dynamic situ-
ations. From the point of view of reference anal-
ysis, our corpora contribute to augmenting the re-
sources of multimodal dialogue corpora annotated
with reference relations which have been minor
in number compared to other types of text cor-
pora. From the point of view of reference gen-
eration, our corpora contribute to increasing the
resources available that can be used to further re-
search of this kind. In addition, our corpora con-
tribute to comparative studies of human referential
behaviour in different languages
The structure of the paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the experimental set-up for data
collection which was introduced in our previous
work (Spanger et al, 2009a). The setting is basi-
cally the same for the construction of the English
corpus. Section 3 explains the annotation scheme
adopted in our corpora, followed by a description
of a preliminary analysis of the corpora in sec-
tion 4. Section 5 briefly mentions related work
to highlight the characteristics of our corpora. Fi-
nally, Section 6 concludes the paper and looks at
possible future directions.

2 Data collection
2.1 Experimental set-up
We recruited subjects in pairs of friends and col-
leagues. Each pair was instructed to solve Tan-
gram puzzles collaboratively. Tangram puzzles
are geometrical puzzles that originated in ancient
China. The goal of a Tangram puzzle is to con-
struct a given goal shape by arranging seven sim-
ple shapes, as shown in Figure 1. The pieces in-
clude two large triangles, a medium-sized trian-
gle, two small triangles, a parallelogram and a
square.
With the aim of recording the precise position
of every piece and every action the participants
made during the solving process, we implemented
a Tangram simulator in which the pieces can be
moved, rotated and flipped with simple mouse op-
erations on a computer display. The simulator dis-
plays two areas: a goal shape area and a work-
ing area where the pieces can be manupulated and
their movements are shown in real time.
We assigned a different role to each participant
of a pair: one acted as the solver and the other as
the operator. The operator has a mouse for manip-
ulating Tangram pieces, but does not have a goal
shape on the screen. The solver has a goal shape
on the screen but does not have a mouse. This set-
ting naturally leads to a situation where given a
certain goal shape, the solver thinks of the neces-
sary arrangement of the pieces and gives instruc-
tions to the operator how to move them, while the
operator manipulates the pieces with the mouse
39
according to the solver?s instructions.
Figure 2: Picture of the experiment setting
As we mentioned in our previous
study (Spanger et al, 2009a), this interaction
produces frequent use of referring expressions
intended to distinguish specific pieces of the
puzzle. In our Tangram simulator, all pieces
are of the same color, thus color is not useful
in identifying a specific piece, i.e. only size
and shape are discriminative object-intrinsic
attributes. Instead, we can expect other attributes
such as spatial relations and deictic reference to
be used more often.
Each pair of participants sat side by side as
shown in Figure 2. Each participant had his/her
own computer display showing the shared work-
ing area. A room-divider screen was set between
the solver (right side) and operator (left side) to
prevent the operator from seeing the goal shape on
the solver?s screen, and to restrict their interaction
to speech only.

Figure 3: The goal shapes given to the subjects
Each participant pair was assigned 4 trials con-
sisting of two symmetric and two asymmetric
goal shapes as shown in Figure 3. In Cogni-
tive Science, a wide variety of different kinds of
puzzles have been employed extensively in the
field of Insight Problem solving. This has been
termed the ?puzzle-problem approach? (Sternberg
and Davidson, 1996; Suzuki et al, 2001) and
in the case of physical puzzles has relatively of-
ten involved puzzle tasks of symmetric shapes
like the so-called T-puzzle, e.g. (Kiyokawa and
Nakazawa, 2006). In more recent work Tangram
puzzles have been used as a means to study var-
ious new aspects of human problem solving ap-
proaches, including collection of of eye-gaze in-
formation (Baran et al, 2007). In order to col-
lect data as broadly as possible in this context, we
set up puzzle-problems including both symmetri-
cal as well as asymmetrical ones as shown in Fig-
ure 3.
The participants exchanged their roles after two
trials, i.e. a participant first solves a symmetric and
then an asymmetric puzzle as the solver and then
does the same as the operator, and vice versa. The
order of the puzzle trials is the same for all pairs.
Before starting the first trial as the operator,
each participant had a short training exercise in
order to learn how to manipulate pieces with the
mouse. The initial arrangement of the pieces was
randomised every time. We set a time limit of 15
minutes for the completion of each trial (i.e. con-
struction of the goal shape). In order to prevent the
solver from getting into deep thought and keeping
silent, the simulator is designed to give a hint ev-
ery five minutes by showing a correct piece posi-
tion in the goal shape area. After 10 minutes have
passed, a second hint is provided, while the pre-
vious hint disappears. A trial ends when the goal
shape is complete or the time is up. Utterances by
the participants are recorded separately in stereo
through headset microphones in synchronisation
with the position of the pieces and the mouse op-
erations. Piece positions and mouse actions were
automatically recorded by the simulator at inter-
vals of 10 msec.

2.2 Subjects and collected data
For our Japanese corpus, we recruited 12 Japanese
graduate students of the Cognitive Science depart-
ment, 4 females and 8 males, and split them into 6
pairs. All pairs knew each other previously and
were of the same sex and approximately same
age3. We collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6
pairs) of about 4 hours and 16 minutes. The av-
erage length of a dialogue was 10 minutes 40 sec-
onds (SD = 3 minutes 18 seconds).
For the comparable English corpus, we re-
cruited 12 native English speakers of various oc-
cupations, 6 males and 6 females. Their aver-
age age was 30. There were 6 pairs all of whom
knew each other beforehand except for one pair.
Whereas during the creation of the Japanese cor-
pus we had to give extra attention to ensuring that
social relationships did not have an impact on how
the subjects communicated with one another, for
the English corpus there was no such concern. We
collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6 pairs) of 5
hours and 7 minutes total length. The average
length of a dialogue was 12 minutes 47 seconds
(SD = 3 minutes 34 seconds).
3 Annotation
The recorded speech data was transcribed and
the referring expressions were annotated with
the Web-based multi-purpose annotation tool
3In Japan, the relationship of senior to junior or socially
higher to lower placed might affect the language use. We
carefully recruited pairs to avoid the effects of this social re-
lationship such as the possible use of overly polite and indi-
rect language, reluctance to correct mistakes etc.
Table 2: Attributes of referring expressions
dpr : demonstrative pronoun, e.g. ?the same one?,
?this?, ?that?, ?it?
dad : demonstrative adjective, e.g. ?that triangle?
siz : size, e.g. ?the large triangle?
typ : type, e.g. ?the square?
dir : direction of a piece, e.g. ?the triangle facing the
left?.
prj : projective spatial relation (including directional
prepositions or nouns such as ?right?, ?left?,
?above?. . . ) e.g. ?the triangle to the left of the
square?
tpl : topological spatial relation (including non-
directional prepositions or nouns such as ?near?,
?middle?. . . ), e.g. ?the triangle near the square?
ovl : overlap, e.g. ?the small triangle under the large
one?
act : action on pieces, e.g ?the triangle that you are
holding now?, ?the triangle that you just rotated?
cmp : complement, e.g. ?the other one?
sim : similarity, e.g. ?the same one?
num : number, e.g. ?the two triangle?
rpr : repair, e.g. ?the big, no, small triangle?
err : obvious erroneous expression, e.g. ?the square?
referring to a triangle
nest : nested expression; when a referring expression
includes another referring expression, only the
outermost expression is annotated with this at-
tribute, e.g. ?(the triangle to the left of (the small
triangle))?
meta: metaphorical expression, e.g. ?the leg?, ?the
head?
SLAT (Noguchi et al, 2008)4. Our target expres-
sions in this corpus are referring expressions re-
ferring to a puzzle piece or a set of puzzle pieces.
We do not deal with expressions referring to a lo-
cation, a part of a piece or a constructed shape.
These expressions are put aside for future work.
The annotation of referring expressions is three-
fold: (1) identification of the span of expressions,
(2) identification of their referents, and (3) assign-
ment of a set of attributes to each referring expres-
sion.
Using the multimodal annotation tool ELAN,5
the annotations of referring expressions were then
merged with extra-linguistic data recorded by the
Tangram simulator. The available extra-linguistic
information from the simulator consists of (1) the
action on a piece, (2) the coordinates of the mouse
cursor and (3) the position of each piece in the
4We did not use SLAT for English corpus annotation. In-
stead, ELAN was directly used for annotating referring ex-
pressions.

working area. Actions and mouse cursor positions
are recorded at intervals of 10 msec, and are ab-
stracted into (1) a time span labeled with an action
symbol (?move?, ?rotate? or ?flip?) and its target
piece number (1?7), and (2) a time span labeled
with a piece number which is under the mouse
cursor during that span. The position of pieces is
updated and recorded with a timestamp when the
position of any piece changes. Information about
piece positions is not merged into the ELAN files
and is kept in separate files. As a result, we have
11 time-aligned ELAN Tiers as shown in Table 1.
Two annotators (two of the authors) first an-
notated four Japanese dialogues separately and
based on a discussion of discrepancies, decided
on the following criteria to identify a referring ex-
pression.
? The minimum span of a noun phrase in-
cluding necessary information to identify a
referent is annotated. The span might in-
clude repairs with their reparandum and dis-
fluency (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993) if
needed.
? Demonstrative adjectives are included in ex-
pressions.
? Erroneous expressions are annotated with a
special attribute.
? An expression without a definite referent (i.e.
a group of possible referents or none) is as-
signed a referent number sequence consist-
ing of a prefix, followed by the sequence of
possible referents as its referent, if any are
present.
? All expressions appearing in muttering to
oneself are excluded.
Table 2 shows a list of attributes of referring
expressions used in annotating the corpus.
The rest of the 20 Japanese dialogues were an-
notated by two of the authors and discrepancies
were resolved by discussion. Four English dia-
logues have been annotated so far by one of the
authors.
4 Preliminary corpus analysis
We have already completed the Japanese corpus,
which is named REX-J (2008-08), but only 4 out
of 24 dialogues have been annotated for the En-
glish counterpart (REX-E (2010-03)). Table 3
shows a summary of the trials. The horizontal
42
lines divide the trials by pairs, ?o? in the ?suc-
cess? column denotes that the trial was success-
fully completed in the time limit (15 minutes), and
the ?OP-REX? and ?SV-REX? columns show the
number of referring expressions used by the op-
erator and the solver respectively. The following
subsections describe a preliminary comparison of
the English and Japanese corpora.

4.1 Task performance
We conducted a two-way ANOVA with the task
completion time as the dependent variable, and
the goal shape and the language as the indepen-
dent variables. Only the main effect of the lan-
guage was significant (F (1, 40) = 5.82, p <
0.05). Table 4 shows the average and the standard
deviation of the completion time. Note that we set
a time limit (15 minutes) for solving the puzzle.
We considered the completion time as 15 minutes
even when a puzzle was not actually solved in the
time limit. We also conducted a two-way ANOVA
using only the successful cases. Both main effects
and their interaction were not significant.
We then conducted an ANOVA with the num-
ber of successfully solved puzzles by each pair as
the dependent variable and the language as the in-
dependent variable. The main effect was signifi-
cant (F (1, 10) = 6.79, p < 0.05). Table 5 shows
the average number of success goals per pair and
the success rate with their standard deviations in
parentheses.
Finally, we conducted an ANOVA with the
number of pairs who succeeded in solving a goal

shape as the dependent variable and the goal shape
as the independent variable. The main effect was
not significant.
In summary, we found a difference in the task
performance between the languages in terms of
the task completion time and the success rate, but
no difference among the goal shapes. This dif-
ference could be explained by the diversity of the
subjects rather than the difference of languages.
The Japanese subject group consisted of univer-
sity graduate students from the same department
(Cognitive Science) and roughly of the same age
(Average = 23.3, SD = 1.5). In contrast, the En-
glish subjects have diverse backgrounds (e.g. high
school students, university faculty, writer, pro-
grammer, etc.) and age (Average = 30.8, SD =
11.7). In addition, a familiarity with this kind of
geometric puzzle might have some effect. How-
ever, we collected a familiarity with the puzzle
only from the English subjects, we could not con-
duct further analysis on this viewpoint. Anyhow,
in this respect, the independent variable should
have been named ?subject group? instead of ?lan-
guage?.
4.2 Referring expressions
It is important to note that since we have only
completed the annotation of four dialogs, all by
one pair of subjects, our analyses of referring ex-
pressions are tentative and pending further analy-
sis.
We have 200 and 1,243 referring expressions by
the operator and the solver respectively, 1,444 in
total in the 24 Japanese dialogues. On the other
hand we have 26 (operator) and 315 (solver) re-
ferring expressions in 4 English dialogues. The
average number of referring expressions per di-
alogue in Table 3 suggests that English subjects
use more referring expressions than Japanese sub-
jects. Since we have only the data from a single
pair, we cannot say whether this tendency applies
to the other pairs. We cannot draw a decisive con-
clusion until we complete the annotation of the
English corpus.
Table 6 shows the total frequencies of the at-
tributes and their frequencies per dialogue. The
table gives us an impression of significantly fre-
quent use of demonstrative pronouns (dpr) by the

attributes of projective spatial relations (prj) and
actions on the referent (act).6 The English subjects
use more complement attributes (cmp) as well as
more number attributes (num).
5 Related work
Over the last decade, with a growing recogni-
tion that referring expressions frequently appear
in collaborative task dialogues (Clark and Wilkes-
Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), a num-
ber of corpora have been constructed to study the
nature of their use. This tendency also reflects
the recognition that this area yields both challeng-
ing research topics as well as promising applica-
tions such as human-robot interaction (Foster et
al., 2008; Kruijff et al, 2010).
The COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al,
2000) was collected from keyboard-dialogs be-
tween two participants, who worked together on
a simple 2-D design task, buying and arranging
furniture for two rooms. The COCONUT cor-
pus is limited in annotations which describe sym-
bolic object information such as object intrinsic
attributes and location in discrete co-ordinates. As
an initial work of constructing a corpus for collab-
orative tasks, the COCONUT corpus can be char-
acterised as having a rather simple domain as well
6We called such expressions as action-mentioning expres-
sions (AME) in our previous work.
as limited annotation.
The QUAKE corpus (Byron, 2005) and its suc-
cessor, the SCARE corpus (Stoia et al, 2008) deal
with a more complex domain, where two partici-
pants collaboratively play a treasure hunting game
in a 3-D virtual world. Despite the complexity
of the domain, the participants were only allowed
limited actions, e.g. moving step forward, pushing
a button etc.
As a part of the JAST project, the Joint Con-
struction Task (JCT) corpus was created based on
dialogues in which two participants constructed a
puzzle (Foster et al, 2008). The setting of the
experiment is quite similar to ours except that
both participants have even roles. Since our main
concern is referring expressions, we believe our
asymmetric setting elicits more referring expres-
sions than the symmetric setting of the JCT cor-
pus.
In contrast to these previous corpora, our cor-
pora record a wide range of information useful
for analysis of human reference behaviour in situ-
ated dialogue. While the domain of our corpora is
simple compared to the QUAKE and SCARE cor-
pora, we allowed a comparatively large flexibil-
ity in the actions necessary for achieving the goal
shape (i.e. flipping, turning and moving of puzzle
pieces at different degrees), relative to the com-
plexity of the domain. Providing this relatively
larger freedom of actions to the participants to-
gether with the recording of detailed information
allows for research into new aspects of referring
expressions.
As for a multilingual aspect, all the above cor-
pora are English. There have been several recent
attempts at collecting multilingual corpora in situ-
ated domains. For instance, (Gargett et al, 2010)
collected German and English corpora in the same
setting. Their domain is similar to the QUAKE
corpus. Van der Sluis et al (2009) aim at a com-
parative study of referring expressions between
English and Japanese. Their domain is still static
at the moment. Our corpora aim at dealing with
the dynamic nature of situated dialogues between
very different languages, English and Japanese.

6 Conclusion and future work
This paper presented an overview of our English-
Japanese bilingual multimodal corpora of refer-
ring expressions in a collaborative problem solv-
ing setting. The Japanese corpus was completed
and has already been used for research (Spanger et
al., 2009b; Spanger et al, 2010; Iida et al, 2010),
but the English counterpart is still undergoing an-
notation. We have also presented a preliminary
comparative analysis of these corpora in terms of
the task performance and usage of referring ex-
pressions. We found a significant difference of the
task performance, which could be attributed to the
difference in diversity of subjects. We have tenta-
tive results on the usage of referring expressions,
since only four English dialogues are available at
the moment.
The data collection experiments were con-
ducted in August 2008 for Japanese and in March
2010 for English. Between these periods, we
conducted various data collections to build differ-
ent types of Japanese corpora (March, 2009 and
November 2009). These experiments involve cap-
turing eye-gaze information of participants during
problem solving, and introducing variants of puz-
zles (Polyomino, Double Tangram and Tangram
without any hints7). They are also under prepa-
ration for publication. Table 7 gives an overview
of the REX-J corpus family, where ?#valid? de-
notes the number of dialogues with valid eye-
gaze data. Eye-gaze data is difficult to capture
cleanly throughout a dialogue. We discarded di-
alogues in which eye-gaze was captured success-
fully less than 70% of the total time of the dia-
logue. Namely, we annotated or will annotate di-
alogues with validated eye-gaze data only.
These corpora enable research on utilising eye-
gaze information in reference resolution and gen-

eration, and evaluation in different tasks (puzzles)
as well. We are planning to distribute the REX-J
corpus family through GSK (Language Resources
Association in Japan)8, and the REX-E corpus
from both University of Brighton and GSK.
