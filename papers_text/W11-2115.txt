Abstract
This paper describes the development op-
erated into MANY for the 2011 WMT
system combination evaluation campaign.
Hypotheses from French/English and En-
glish/French MT systems were combined
with a new version of MANY, an open
source system combination software based
on confusion networks decoding currently
developed at LIUM. MANY has been up-
dated in order to optimize decoder pa-
rameters with MERT, which proves to
find better weights. The system combi-
nation yielded significant improvements in
BLEU score when applied on system com-
bination data from two languages.
1 Introduction
This year, the LIUM computer science laboratory
participated in the French-English system combi-
nation task at WMT?11 evaluation campaign. The
system used for this task is MANY1 (Barrault,
2010), an open source system combination soft-
ware based on Confusion Networks (CN).
For this year evaluation, rather more technical
than scientific improvements have been added to
MANY. The tuning process has been improved
by using MERT (Och, 2003) as a replacement
of the numerical optimizer Condor (Berghen and
Bersini, 2005). The impact of such change is de-
tailed in section 3.
After the evaluation period, some experiments
have been performed on the English-French sys-
tem combination task. The results are presented
in the section 5. Before that, a quick description
of MANY, including recent developments, can be
found in section 2.

2 System description
MANY is a system combination software (Bar-
rault, 2010) based on the decoding of a lattice
made of several Confusion Networks (CN). This
is a widespread approach in MT system combina-
tion (Rosti et al, 2007; Shen et al, 2008; Karakos
et al, 2008; Rosti et al, 2009). MANY can be
decomposed in two main modules. The first one
is the alignment module which actually is a modi-
fied version of TERp (Snover et al, 2009). Its role
is to incrementally align the hypotheses against a
backbone in order to create a confusion network.
Those confusion networks are then connected to-
gether to create a lattice. This module uses dif-
ferent costs (which corresponds to a match, an in-
sertion, a deletion, a substitution, a shift, a syn-
onym and a stem) to compute the best alignment
and incrementally build a confusion network. In
the case of confusion network, the match (substi-
tution, synonyms, and stems) costs are considered
when the word in the hypothesis matches (is a sub-
stitution, a synonyms or a stems of) at least one
word of the considered confusion sets in the CN.

The second module is the decoder. This decoder
is based on the token pass algorithm and it accepts
as input the lattice previously created. The proba-
bilities computed in the decoder can be expressed
as follow :
135
log(PW ) =
?
i
?i log
(
hi(t)
)
(1)
where t is the hypothesis, the ?i are the weights
of the feature functions hi. The following features
are considered for decoding:
? The language model probability: the proba-
bility given by a 4-gram language model.
? The word penalty: penalty depending on the
size (in words) of the hypothesis.
? The null-arc penalty: penalty depending on
the number of null-arcs crossed in the lattice
to obtain the hypothesis.
? System weights: each word receive a weight
corresponding to the sum of the weights of all
systems which proposed it.
3 Tuning
As mentioned before, MANY is made of two main
modules: the alignment module based on a modi-
fied version of TERp and the decoder. Considering
a maximum of 24 systems for this year evaluation,
33 parameters in total have to be optimized. By
default, TERp costs are set to 0.0 for match and
1.0 for everything else. These costs are not correct,
since a shift in that case will hardly be possible.
TERp costs are tuned with Condor (a numerical
optimizer based on Powell?s algorithm, (Berghen
and Bersini, 2005)). Decoder feature functions
weights are optimized with MERT (Och, 2003).
The 300-best list created at each MERT iteration
is appended to the n-best lists created at previous
iterations. This proves to be a more reliable tuning
as shown in the following experiments.
During experiments, data from WMT?09 eval-
uation campaign are used for testing the tuning
approach. news-dev2009a is used as development
set, and news-dev2009b as internal test, these cor-
pora are described in Table 1.

observe that 2-step tuning provides almost +0.9
BLEU point improvement on development corpus
which is well reflected on test set with a gain of
more than 0.8 BLEU. By using MERT, this im-
provement is increased to reach almost +2 BLEU
point on dev corpus and +1.7 BLEU on test.
There are two main reasons for this improve-
ment. The first one is the use of MERT which
make use of specific heuristics to better opti-
mize toward BLEU score. The second one is the
fully log-linear interpolation of features functions
scores operated into the decoder (previously, the
word and null penalties were applied linearly).

Choosing the right number of systems to com-
bine: Table 6 shows the performance of the in-
put systems (ordered by BLEU score computed on
newssyscombtune2011) and the result of 3 system
combination setups. The difference in these se-
tups only reside on the number of inputs to use for
combination (5, 10 and all system outputs). Notice
that the contrastive runs have not been used when
combining 5 and 10 systems. The motivation for
this is to benefit from the multi-site systems de-
velopment which more likely provide varied out-
puts (i.e. different ngrams and word choice). The
results show that combining 5 systems is slightly
better than 10, but give more than 1 BLEU point
improvement compared to combining all systems.
Still, the combination always provide an improve-
ment, which was not the case in last year evalua-
tion.
The results obtained by combining 5 and 10 sys-
tems are presented in Table 7.

Optimizing MANY on newssyscombtune2011
corpus produced the parameter set presented in Ta-
ble 8. We can see that the weights of all system are
not proportional to the BLEU score obtained on
the development corpus. This suggest that a bet-
ter system selection could be found. This is even
more probable since the weight of system Sys2 is
positive (which imply a negative impact on each
word proposed by this system), which means that
when an hypothesis contains a word coming from
this system, then its score is decreased.

is the highest, whereas the ?closest? system get the
smallest weight. This suggests that systems closer
to other systems tends to be less useful for sys-
tem combination. This is an interesting behaviour
which has to be explored deeper and validated on
other tasks and corpora.
5 MANY for french outputs
After the evaluation period, some experiments
have been conducted in order to combine french
outputs. The main difference lie in the fact that
linguistic resources are not easily or freely avail-
able for that kind of language. Therefore, instead
of using TERp with relax3 shift constraint, the
strict constraint was used (shifts occur only when
a match is found).
The available data are detailed in the Table 10.

system combination in french.
The results obtained are presented in Table 11.
The BLEU score increase by more than 0.8 point
but the TER score decrease by 0.58. The metric
targeted during tuning is BLEU, which can ex-
plain the improvement in that metric. When deal-
ing with english text, the only case where such be-
haviour is observed is when combining all systems
(see Table 6.
6 MANY technical news
Several improvements have been performed on
MANY. The decoder is now based on a fully log-

linear model (whereas before, the word and null
penalties were applied linearly). Using MERT to
tune the decoder parameters is therefore possible
and allows to reach bigger improvement compared
to using Condor. This is probably due to the fact
that MERT uses several heuristics useful for tun-
ing on BLEU score.
In order to facilitate the use of MANY, it has
been integrated in the Experiment Management
System, EMS - (Koehn, 2010). An experiment can
now be setup/modified/re-run easily by modifying
a single configuration file. The default behavior of
this framework is to perform 3 runs of MERT in
parallel (using torque) and take the best optimiza-
tion run. Apart from avoiding local maximum, the
procedure allows to see the variability of the opti-
mization process and report more realistic results
(for example, by taking the average).
7 Conclusion and future work
For WMT?11 system combination evaluation cam-
paign, several rather technical improvements have
been performed into MANY. By homogenizing
the log-linear model used by the decoder and uti-
lizing MERT for tuning, MANY achieves im-
provements of more than 2 BLEU points on
WMT?09 data and about 1.3 BLEU point on
newssyscombtest2011 relatively to the best single
system. Moreover, a dry-run operated on french
data shows a promising result with an improve-
ment of more than 0.8 BLEU points. This will be
further explored in the future.
MANY can benefit from various information.
At the moment, the decision taken by the decoder
mainly depends on a target language model. This
is clearly not enough to achieve greater perfor-
mances. The next issues which will be addressed
within the MANY framework is to estimate good
confidence measure to use in place of the systems
138
priors. These confidences measures have to be re-
lated to the system performances, but also to the
complementarity of the systems considered.
