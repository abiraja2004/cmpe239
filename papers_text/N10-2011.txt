Abstract 
SIMPLIFICA is an authoring tool for produc-
ing simplified texts in Portuguese. It provides 
functionalities for lexical and syntactic simpli-
fication and for readability assessment. This 
tool is the first of its kind for Portuguese; it 
brings innovative aspects for simplification 
tools in general, since the authoring process is 
guided by readability assessment based on the 
levels of literacy of the Brazilian population. 
1 Introduction 
In order to promote digital inclusion and accessi-
bility for people with low levels of literacy, partic-
ularly access to documents available on the web, it 
is important to provide textual information in a 
simple and easy way. Indeed, the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.01 establishes 
a set of guidelines that discuss accessibility issues 
and provide accessibility design solutions. WCAG 
requirements address not only structure and tech-
nological aspects, but also how the content should 
be made available to users. However, Web devel-
opers are not always responsible for content prepa-
ration and authoring in a Website. Moreover, in the 
context of Web 2.0 it becomes extremely difficult 
to develop completely WCAG conformant Web-
sites, since users without any prior knowledge 
about the guidelines directly participate on the con-
tent authoring process of Web applications.

In Brazil, since 2001, the INAF index (National 
Indicator of Functional Literacy) has been com-
puted annually to measure the levels of literacy of 
the Brazilian population. The 2009 report pre-
sented a still worrying scenario: 7% of the individ-
uals were classified as illiterate; 21% as literate at 
the rudimentary level; 47% as literate at the basic 
level; and only 25% as literate at the advanced lev-
el (INAF, 2009). These literacy levels are defined 
as: (1) Illiterate: individuals who cannot perform 
simple tasks such as reading words and phrases; 
(2) Rudimentary: individuals who can find expli-
cit information in short and familiar texts (such as 
an advertisement or a short letter); (3) Basic: indi-
viduals who can read and understand texts of aver-
age length, and find information even when it is 
necessary to make some inference; and (4) Ad-
vanced/Fully: individuals who can read longer 
texts, relating their parts, comparing and interpret-
ing information, distinguish fact from opinion, 
make inferences and synthesize. 
We present in this paper the current version of 
an authoring tool named SIMPLIFICA. It helps 
authors to create simple texts targeted at poor lite-
rate readers. It extends the previous version pre-
sented in Candido et al (2009) with two new mod-
ules: lexical simplification and the assessment of 
the level of complexity of the input texts. The 
study is part of the PorSimples project2 (Simplifi-
cation of Portuguese Text for Digital Inclusion and 
Accessibility) (Aluisio et al, 2008).  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2

we describe SIMPLIFICA and the underlying 
technology for lexical and syntactic simplification, 
and for readability assessment. In Section 3 we 
summarize the interaction steps that we propose to 
show in the demonstration session targeting texts 
for low-literate readers of Portuguese. Section 4 
presents final remarks with emphasis on why de-
monstrating this system is relevant.  
2 SIMPLIFICA authoring tool  
SIMLIFICA is a web-based WYSIWYG editor, 
based on TinyMCE web editor3. The user inputs a 
text in the editor and customizes the simplification 
settings, where he/she can choose: (i) strong sim-
plification, where all the complex syntactic phe-
nomena (see details in Section 2.2) are treated for 
each sentence, or customized simplification, where 
the user chooses one or more syntactic simplifica-
tion phenomena to be treated for each sentence, 
and (ii) one or more thesauri to be used in the syn-
tactic and lexical simplification processes. Then 
the user activates the readability assessment mod-
ule to predict the complexity level of a text. This 
module maps the text to one of the three levels of 
literacy defined by INAF: rudimentary, basic or 
advanced. According to the resulting readability 
level the user can trigger the lexical and/or syntac-
tic simplifications modules, revise the automatic 
simplification and restart the cycle by checking the 
readability level of the current version of the text.  
Figure 1 summarizes how the three modules are 
integrated and below we describe in more detail 
the SIMPLIFICA modules.

2.1 Lexical Simplification  
Basically, the first part of the lexical simplification 
process consists of tokenizing the original text and 
marking the words that are considered complex. In 
order to judge a word as complex or not, we use 3 
dictionaries created for the PorSimples project: one 
containing words common to youngsters, a second 
one composed by frequent words extracted from 
news texts for children and nationwide newspa-
pers, and a third one containing concrete words.  
The lexical simplification module also uses the 
Unitex-PB dictionary4 for finding the lemma of the 
words in the text, so that it is possible to look for it 
in the simple words dictionaries. The problem of 
looking for a lemma directly in a dictionary is that 
there are ambiguous words and we are not able to 
deal with different word senses. For dealing with 
part-of-speech (POS) ambiguity, we use the 
MXPOST POS tagger5 trained over NILC tagset6. 
After the text is tagged, the words that are not 
proper nouns, prepositions and numerals are se-
lected, and their POS tags are used to look for their 
lemmas in the dictionaries. As the tagger has not a 
100% precision and some words may not be in the 
dictionary, we look for the lemma only (without 
the tag) when we are not able to find the lemma-
tag combination in the dictionary. Still, if we are 
not able to find the word, the lexical simplification 
module assumes that the word is complex and 
marks it for simplification. 
The last step of the process consists in providing 
simpler synonyms for the marked words. For this 
task, we use the thesauri for Portuguese TeP 2.07 
and the lexical ontology for Portuguese PAPEL8. 
This task is carried out when the user clicks on a 
marked word, which triggers a search in the the-
sauri for synonyms that are also present in the 
common words dictionary. If simpler words are 
found, they are listed in order, from the simpler to 
the more complex ones. To determine this order, 
we used Google API to search each word in the 
web: we assume that the higher a word frequency, 
the simpler it is. Automatic word sense disambigu-
ation is left for future work.

2.2 Syntactic Simplification 
Syntactic simplification is accomplished by a rule-
based system, which comprises seven operations 
that are applied sentence-by-sentence to a text in 
order to make its syntactic structure simpler.  
Our rule-based text simplification system is 
based on a manual for Brazilian Portuguese syntac-
tic simplification (Specia et al, 2008). According 
to this manual, simplification operations should be 
applied when any of the 22 linguistic phenomena 
covered by our system (see Candido et al (2009) 
for details) is detected. Our system treats apposi-
tive, relative, coordinate and subordinate clauses, 
which had already been addressed by previous 
work on text simplification (Siddharthan, 2003). 
Additionally, we treat passive voice, sentences in 
an order other than Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), 
and long adverbial phrases. The simplification op-
erations available to treat these phenomena are: 
split sentence, change particular discourse markers 
by simpler ones, change passive to active voice, 
invert the order of clauses, convert to subject-verb-
object ordering, and move long adverbial phrases. 
Each sentence is parsed in order to identify syn-
tactic phenomena for simplification and to segment 
the sentence into portions that will be handled by 
the operations. We use the parser PALAVRAS 
(Bick, 2000) for Portuguese. Gasperin et al (2010) 
present the evaluation of the performance of our 
syntactic simplification system.  
Since our syntactic simplifications are conserva-
tive, the simplified texts become longer than the 
original ones due to sentence splitting. We ac-
knowledge that low-literacy readers prefer short 
texts, and in the future we aim to provide summa-
rization within SIMPLIFICA (see (Watanabe et al, 
2009)). Here, the shortening of the text is a respon-
sibility of the author. 
2.3 Readability assessment 
With our readability assessment module, we can 
predict the readability level of a text, which cor-
responds to the literacy level expected from the 
target reader: rudimentary, basic or advanced.  
We have adopted a machine-learning classifier 
to identify the level of the input text; we use the 
Support Vector Machines implementation from 
Weka9 toolkit (SMO). We have used 7 corpora 
                                                        
9 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 
within 2 different genres (general news and popu-
lar science articles) to train the classifier. Three of 
these corpora contain original texts published in 
online newspapers and magazines. The other cor-
pora contain manually simplified versions of most 
of the original texts. These were simplified by a 
linguist, specialized in text simplification, accord-
ing to the two levels of simplification proposed in 
our project, natural and strong, which result in 
texts adequate for the basic and rudimentary litera-
cy levels, respectively. 
Our feature set is composed by cognitively-
motivated features derived from the Coh-Metrix-
PORT tool10, which is an adaptation for Brazilian 
Portuguese of Coh-Metrix 2.0 (free version of 
Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al 2003)) also developed 
in the context of the PorSimples project. Coh-
Metrix-PORT implements the metrics in Table 1.

We also included seven new metrics to Coh-
Metrix-PORT: average verb, noun, adjective and 
adverb ambiguity, incidence of high-level constitu-
ents, content words and functional words.  
We measured the performance of the classifier 
on identifying the levels of the input texts by a 
cross-validation experiment. We trained the clas-
sifier on our 7 corpora and reached 90% F-measure 
on identifying texts at advanced level, 48% at basic 
level, and 73% at rudimentary level. 
 
3. A working session at SIMPLIFICA  
 
In the NAACL demonstration section we aim to 
present all functionalities of the tool for authoring 
simple texts, SIMPLIFICA. We will run all steps 
of the authoring process ? readability assessment, 
lexical simplification and syntactic simplification ? 
in order to demonstrate the use of the tool in pro-
ducing a text for basic and rudimentary readers of 
Portuguese, regarding the lexical and the syntactic 
complexity of an original text.  
We outline a script of our demonstration at 
http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/porsimples/demo/dem
o_script.htm. In order to help the understanding by 
non-speakers of Portuguese we provide the transla-
tions of the example texts shown. 
 
4. Final Remarks 
 
A tool for authoring simple texts in Portuguese is 
an innovative software, as are all the modules that 
form the tool. Such tool is extremely important in 
the construction of texts understandable by the ma-
jority of the Brazilian population. SIMPLIFICA?s 
target audience is varied and includes: teachers that 
use online text for reading practices; publishers; 
journalists aiming to reach poor literate readers; 
content providers for distance learning programs; 
government agencies that aim to communicate to 
the population as a whole; companies that produce 
technical manuals and medicine instructions; users 
of legal language, in order to facilitate the under-
standing of legal documents by lay people; and 
experts in language studies and computational lin-
guistics for future research. 
Future versions of SIMPLIFICA will also pro-
vide natural simplification, where the target sen-
tences for simplifications are chosen by a machine 
learning classifier (Gasperin et al, 2009).
