Abstract 
Although not very well investigated, a crucial as-
pect of gesture use in dialogues is to regulate the 
organisation of the interaction. People use gestures 
decisively, for example to indicate that they want 
someone to take the turn, to 'brush away' what 
someone else said, or to acknowledge others' con-
tributions. We present first insights from a corpus-
based investigation of how gestures are used to 
regulate dialogue, and we provide first results from 
an account to capture these phenomena in agent-
based communication simulations. By advancing a 
model for autonomous gesture generation to also 
cover gesture interpretation, this account enables a 
full gesture turn exchange cycle of generation, un-
derstanding and acceptance/generation in virtual 
conversational agents. 
1 Motivation 
Research on gestures must combine empirical, 
theoretical and simulation methods to investigate 
form, content and function of gestures in relation 
to speech. Our work is based on a corpus of multi-
modal data, the Bielefeld Speech and Gesture 
Alignment corpus of route-description dialogues 
(SAGA corpus, L?cking et al 2010). The point of 
departure of our research has been work on iconic 
and deictic gestures over many years. In this paper 
we focus on a not very well investigated function 
of gestures which we have repeatedly observed in 
this corpus, namely, the regulation of dialogue.  
Most of current gesture research is oriented to-
wards the semiotics of a Peircean tradition as can  
for instance be seen from McNeill?s ?Kendon?s 
continuum? (McNeill 1992, p. 37). As a conse-
quence of this Peircian orientation, gestures have 
been viewed as single signs interfacing with 
speech. Going beyond the integration of in-
put/output modalities in single speech-gesture 
compositions (Johnston and Bangalore, 2005), lit-
tle effort has been spent on the investigation of 
sequences of gestures and speech-gesture composi-
tion both within and across speakers (Hahn and 
Rieser 2010, Rieser 2010). Furthermore, research 
of gesture meaning was restricted to the contribu-
tion of gesture content to propositional content. An 
exception to this research line has been the work of 
Bavelas et al (1992, 1995). It is characterised by 
two features, a functional perspective on gesture in 
opposition to purely classificatory and typological 
ones and an interest to systematically investigate 
the role of gesture in interaction. In particular, 
Bavelas et al (1992) proposed a distinction be-
tween ?topic gestures? and ?interactive gestures?: 
Topic gestures depict semantic information di-
rectly related to the topic of discourse, while inter-
active gestures refer to some aspect of the process 
of conversing with another person. Interactive ges-
tures include delivery gestures (e.g. marking in-
formation status as new, shared, digression), citing 
gestures (acknowledging others? prior contribu-
tions), seeking gestures (seeking agreement, or 
help in finding a word), and turn coordination ges-
 
88
 tures (e.g. taking or giving the turn). Gill et al 
(1999) noted similar functions of gesture use, add-
ing body movements to the repertoire of pragmatic 
acts used in dialogue act theory (e.g. turn-taking, 
grounding, acknowledgements).  
We aim to find out how gestures are related to and 
help regulate the structure of dialogue. We will call 
these gestures `discourse gestures?. Relevant re-
search questions in this respect are the following: 
How can gesture support next speaker selection if 
this follows regular turn distribution mechanisms 
such as current speaker selects next? From the dia-
logues in SAGA we know that averting next 
speaker?s self-selection is of similar importance as 
handing over the floor to the next speaker. So, how 
can averting self-selection of other be accom-
plished gesturally? A still different problem is how 
gesture is utilised to establish an epistemically 
transparent, reliable common ground, say a tight 
world of mutual belief. A precondition for that is 
how gesture can help to indicate a gesturer?s stance 
to the information he provides. Natural language 
has words to indicate degrees of confidence in in-
formation such as probably, seemingly, approxi-
mately, perhaps, believe, know, guess etc. Can ges-
tures acquire this function as well?  
All these issues can be synopsised as follows: How 
can gestures?apart from their manifest contribu-
tion to propositional content?be used to push the 
dialogue machinery forward? In our research, ges-
ture simulation and theory of speech-gesture inte-
gration are developed in tandem. Up to now, both  
have been tied to occurrences of single gestures 
and their embedding in dialogue acts. In this paper, 
we present first steps along both methodological 
strands to explore the use and function of gesture 
in dialogue. We start with an empirical perspective 
on discourse gestures in section 2. In section 3 we 
briefly describe our gesture simulation model 
which so far simulates gesture use employing the 
virtual agent MAX independent of discourse struc-
tures. Section 4 analyses a corpus example of a 
minimal discourse which is regulated mainly by 
gestures of the two interactants. This provides the 
basis for our proposed extension of the gesture 
generation approach to capture the discourse func-
tion of gestures as described in section 5. This ex-
tension will encompass a novel approach to em-
ploy the very generation model used for gesture 
production, and hence all the heuristic gesture 
knowledge it captures, also for gesture interpreta-
tion in dialogue. Section 6 discusses the difference 
between pure interactive gestures and discourse 
gestures and proposes further steps that need to be 
taken to elucidate how gestures are used as a vehi-
cle for regulating dialogue.  
2 Empirical Work on Discourse Gestures 
In looking for discourse gestures we started from 
the rated annotation of 6000 gestures in the SAGA 
corpus. We managed to annotate and rate about 
5000 of them according to traditional criteria using 
practices and fine-grained gesture morphology like 
hand-shape and wrist-movement. About 1000 ges-
tures could not be easily subsumed under the tradi-
tional gesture types (iconics, deictics, metaphorics, 
beats). Furthermore, they were observed to corre-
late with discourse properties such as current 
speaker?s producing his contribution or non-
regular interruption by other speaker.  
For purposes of the classification of the remaining 
1000 gestures we established the following func-
tional working definition: `Discourse gestures? are 
gestures tied up with properties or functions of 
agents? contributions in dialogue such as success-
fully producing current turn, establishing coher-
ence across different speakers? turns by gestural 
reference or indicating who will be next speaker.  
What did we use for dialogue structure? Being fa-
miliar with dialogue models such as SDRT (Asher 
and Lascarides, 2003), PTT (Poesio and Traum, 
1997), and KoS (Ginzburg, 2011) we soon found 
that these were too restricted to serve descriptive 
purposes. So we oriented our ?classification of dia-
logue gesture enterprise? on the well known turn 
taking organisation model of Sacks et al (1974) 
and Levinson?s (1983) discussion of it. However, it 
soon turned out that even these approaches were 
too normative for the SAGA data: This is due to 
the fact that dialogue participants develop enor-
mous creativity in establishing new rules of con-
tent production and of addressing violations of 
prima facie rules.  
Rules of turn-taking, for example, are not hard and 
fast rules, they can be skirted if the need arises, 
albeit there is a convention that this has to be ac-
knowledged and negotiated. A very clear example 
of an allowed interruption of an on-going produc-
tion is a quickly inserted clarification request serv-
ing the communicative goals of current speaker 
and the aims of the dialogue in general. Another 
 
89
 problem with the Sacks et al model consists in the 
following fact: Since its origination many dialogue 
regularities have been discovered which cannot be 
easily founded on a phenomenological or observa-
tional stratum which is essentially semantics-free. 
This can for example be seen from the develop-
ment of the notion of grounding and common 
ground as originally discussed by Stalnaker (1978), 
Clark (1996) and others. Nevertheless, grounding 
(roughly, coming to agree on the meaning of what 
has been said (see e.g. Traum, 1999; Roque and 
Traum, 2008;  Ginzburg 2011, ch. 4.2 for the op-
tions available) generates verbal structure and ver-
bal structure interfaces with gesture. Other exam-
ples in this class are acknowledgements or accepts 
discussed in more detail below. 
How did we decide on which distinctions of ges-
ture annotation have to be used for characterising 
discourse gestures? In other words, how did we 
conceive of the map between gestures of a certain 
sort and discourse structures? First of all we ob-
served that two types of discourse gestures emerge 
from the SAGA data. Some of them come with 
their own global shape and are close to emblems, 
(i.e. conveyors of stable meaning like the victory 
sign). This is true for example of the ?brush aside 
or brush away? gesture shown in Figure 1 (left), 
indicating a gesturer?s assessment of the down-
rated relevance of information, actions or situa-
tions. Discourse gestures of the second class ex-
ploit the means of, for instance, referring gestures 
or iconic gestures. An example of an iconic gesture 
in this role will be discussed to some extent in sec-
tion 4. Its simulation will be described in sections 3 
and 5.  
Here we explain the phenomenon with respect to 
referring pointing gestures which are easier to fig-
ure out (see Figure 1 (right)). Their usage as under 
focus here is not tied to the information under dis-
cussion but to objects in the immediate discourse 
situation, preferably to the participants of the dia-
logue. These uses have a Gricean flavour in the 
following way: Only considerations of relevance 
and co-occurrence with a turn transition relevance 
place together indicate that prima facie not general 
reference is at stake but indication of next speaker 
role. It wouldn?t make sense to point to the other 
person singling her or him out by indexing, be-
cause her or his identity is clear and well estab-
lished through the on-going interaction. Thus we 
see that a gestural device associated with estab-
lished morphological features, pointing, acquires a 
new function, namely indicating the role of next-
speaker. 
Figure 1: Examples of discourse gestures: the brush-away 
gesture (left) and situated pointing to the upper part of the 
interlocutor?s torso (right) used for next speaker selection in 
a ?Gricean? sense (see text for explanation). 
Now both classes of gestures, ?brush away? used 
to indicate informational or other non-relevance 
and pointing, indicating the role of being next 
speaker exploit the motor equipment of the hands. 
For this reason, annotation of discourse gestures 
can safely be based on the classification schemas 
we have developed for practices like indexing, 
shaping or modelling and for the fine-grained mo-
tor behaviour of the hands as exhibited by palm 
orientation, back-of-hand trajectory etc. In work by 
Hahn & Rieser (2009-2011) the following broad 
classes of discourse gestures were established. We 
briefly comment upon these classes of gestures 
found in the SAGA corpus relevant for dialogue 
structure and interaction:  
? Managing of own turn: A speaker may in-
dicate how successful he is in editing out his 
current production.  
? Mechanisms of next-speaker selection as 
proposed in classical CA research, for in-
stance, pointing to the other?s torso is often 
used as a means to indicate next speaker.  
? In grounding acts and feed-back especially 
iconic gestures are used to convey proposi-
tional content. 
? Clarification requests to work on contribu-
tions: An addressee may indicate the need 
for a quick interruption using a pointing to 
demand a clarification. In contrast, a current 
speaker can ward off the addressee?s incipi-
ent interruption using a palm-up gesture di-
 
90
 rected against the intruder thus setting up a 
?fence?.  
? Evidentials for establishing a confidence 
leve: There are fairly characteristic gestures 
indicating the confidence a speaker has in 
the information he is able to convey. 
? Handling of non-canonical moves by dis-
course participants: Interaction sequences 
consisting of attempts by other speaker to in-
terrupt and to thwart this intention by current 
speaker or to give way to it show how dis-
course participants handle non-canonical 
moves.  
? Assessment of relevance by discourse par-
ticipants: Speakers provide an assessment 
of which information is central and which 
one they want to consider as subsidiary. 
? An indication of topical information with 
respect to time, place or objects is fre-
quently given by pointing or by ?placing ob-
jects? into the gesture space.  
 
We know that this list is open and could, more-
over, depend on the corpus. In this paper the focus 
will be on grounding acts and feedback (see sec-
tions 3-5). The reason is that this way we can pro-
vide an extension of existing work on the simula-
tion of gesture production in a fairly direct manner. 
 
3 Simulating Gesture Use: The Genera-
tion Perspective 
Our starting point to simulate gestural behavior in 
dialogue is a gesture generation system which is 
able to simulate speaker-specific use of iconic ges-
tures given (1) a communicative intention, (2) dis-
course contextual information, and (3) an imagistic 
representation of the object to be described. Our 
approach is based on empirical evidence that 
iconic gesture production in humans is influenced 
by several factors. Apparently, iconic gestures 
communicate through iconicity, that is their physi-
cal form depicts object features such as shape or 
spatial properties. Recent findings indicate that a 
gesture?s form is also influenced by a number of 
contextual constraints such as information struc-
ture (see for instance Cassell and Prevost, 1996), or 
the use of more general gestural representation 
techniques such as shaping or drawing is decisive. 
In addition, inter-subjective differences in gestur-
ing are pertinent. There is, for example, wide vari-
ability in how much individuals gesture when they 
speak. Similarly, inter-subjective differences are 
found in preferences for particular representation 
techniques or low-level morphological features 
such as handshape or handedness (Bergmann & 
Figure 2: Schema of a gesture generation network in which 
gesture production choices are considered either 
probabilistically (chance nodes drawn as ovals) or rule-based 
(decision nodes drawn as rectangles). Each choice is 
depending on a number of contextual variables. The links are 
either learned from speaker-specific corpus data (dotted lines) 
or defined in a set of if-then rules (solid lines). 
 
 
Kopp, 2009).  
To meet the challenge of considering general and 
individual patterns in gesture use, we have pro-
posed GNetIc, a gesture net specialised for iconic 
gestures (Bergmann & Kopp, 2009a), in which we 
model the process of gesture formulation with 
Bayesian decision networks (BDNs) that supple-
ment standard Bayesian networks by decision 
nodes. This formalism provides a representation of 
a finite sequential decision problem, combining 
probabilistic and rule-based decision-making. Each 
decision to be made in the formation of an iconic 
gesture (e.g., whether or not to gesture at all or 
which representation technique to use) is repre-
sented in the network either as a decision node 
(rule-based) or as a chance node with a specific 
probability distribution. Factors which contribute 
to these choices (e.g., visuo-spatial referent fea-
tures) are taken as input to the model (see Figure 2) 
The structure of the network as well as local condi-
tional probability tables are learned from the 
SAGA corpus by means of automated machine 
 
 
91
 learning techniques and supplemented with rule-
based decision making. Individual as well as gen-
eral networks are learned from the SAGA corpus 
by means of automated machine learning tech-
niques and supplemented with rule-based decision 
making. So far, three different factors have been 
incorporated into this model: discourse context, the 
previously performed gesture, and features of the 
referent. The latter are extracted from a hierarchi-
cal representation called Imagistic Description 
Trees (IDT), which is designed to cover all deci-
sive visuo-spatial features of objects one finds in 
iconic gestures (Sowa & Wachsmuth, 2009). Each 
node in an IDT contains an imagistic description  
which holds a schema representing the shape of an 
object or object part. Features extracted from this 
representation in order to capture the main charac-
teristics of a gesture?s referent are whether an ob-
ject can be decomposed into detailed subparts 
(whole-part relations), whether it has any symmet-
rical axes, its main axis, its position in the VR 
stimulus, and its shape properties extracted on the

cular speaker) 
sulting in a posterior distribution of probabilities 
nique is decided to be ?drawing?, to be 
basis of so called multimodal concepts (see Berg-
mann & Kopp, 2008). 
Analyzing the GNetIc modelling results enabled us 
to gain novel insights into the production process 
of iconic gestures: the resulting networks for indi-
vidual speakers differ in their structure and in their 
conditional probability distributions, revealing that  
individual differences
overt gestures, but also in the production process 
they originate from.  
The GNetIc model has been extensively evaluated. 
First, in a prediction-based evaluation, the auto-
matically generated gestures were compared 
against their empirically observed counterparts, 
which yielded very promising results (Bergmann & 
Kopp, 2010). Second, we evaluated the GNetIc 
models in a perception-based evaluation study with 
human addressees. Results showed that GNetIc-
generated gestures actually helped to increase the 
perceived quality of object descriptions given by 
MAX. Moreover, gesturing behaviour generated 
with individual speaker networks was rated more 
positive
human-likeness (Bergmann, Kopp & Eyssel, 
2010). 
GNetIc gesture formulation has been embedded in 
a larger production architecture for speech and ges-
ture production. This architecture comprises mod-
ules that carry out content planning, formulation, 
and realisation for speech and gesture separately, 
but in close and systematic coordination (Berg-
mann & Kopp, 2009). To illustrate gesture genera-
tion on the basis of GNetIc models, consider the 
following example starting upon the arrival of a 
message which specifies the 
to
its characteristic properties:  
 
   lmDescrProperty (townhall-1). 
 
Based on this communicative intention, the imag-
istic description of the involved object gets acti-
vated and the agent adopts a spatial perspective 
towards it from which the object is to be described 
(see Figure 3). The representation is analyzed for 
referent features required by the GNetIc model: 
position, main axis, symmetry, number of subparts, 
and shape properties. Regarding the latter, a unifi-
cation of the imagistic townhall-1 representation 
and a set of underspecified shape property repre-
sentations (e.g. for ?longish?, ?round? etc.) reveals 
?U-shaped? as the most salient property to be de-
picted. All evidence available  (referent features, 
discourse context, previous gesture and linguistic 
context) is propagated through the network 
(learned from the data of  one parti
re
for the values in each chance node.  
 
 
Figure 3: The townhall in the virtual world (left) and sche-
matic of the corresponding IDT content (right); activated parts 
are marked. 
 
This way, it is first decided to generate a gesture in 
the current discourse situation at all, the represen-
ation techt
realized with both hands and the pointing hand-
shape ASL-G. Next, the model?s decision nodes 
are employed to decide on the palm and back of 
hand (BoH) orientation as well as movement type 
and direction: as typical in drawing gestures, the 
palm is oriented downwards and the BoH away 
from the speaker?s body. These gesture features are 
combined with a linear movement  consisting of 
two segments per hand (to the right and backwards 
with the right hand; accordingly mirror-
symmetrical with the left hand) to depict the shape 
of the townhall.  
Accompanying speech is generated from selected 
propositional facts using an NLG engine. Syn-

to fill the slots of a gesture feature matrix which is

ized with the virtual agent MAX (see Figure 4).

4 Example of a Minimal Discourse 
To start with the analysis of how gestures are not
only employed to carry referential content but also 
to regulate dialogue and discourse, we first present 
a datum from the SAGA corpus showing how the 
Follower?s gesture aligns with the Router?s gesture 
to indicate acknowledgement or accept. The situa-
tion is as follows: the Router describes to the Fol-
lower that he 
how it looks to him. A transcription of the
dialogue passage by the Router and the sub
crucial speech-gesture annotation, including the 
Follower, in ELAN looks as displayed in Figure 5 
(placing, drawing, and shaping are names of anno-
tated gestural representation techniques). 
A short comment on the data might be in order: 
When introducing the townhall as a U-shaped 
building, the Router draws the boundary of it, 
namely a ?U?. He then goes on to describe how the 
on-looker apprehends the building. This is accom-
panied by a forward-oriented direction gesture with 
both hands, mimicking into it. In principle, all the 
information necessary to identify the townhall 
from a front perspective is given by then. There is 
a short pause and we also have a turn 
relevance place here. However, there is no feed-
back by the Follower at this point. Therefore the 
Router selects a typical pattern for self-repairs or 
continuations in German, a that is construction in 
the guise of a propositional apposition. Overlap-
ping the production of kind, he produces a three-
dimensional partial U-shaped object maintaining 
the same perspective as in his first drawing of the 
U-shaped border.  
Observe that the Follower already gives feedback 
after front. The most decisive contribution is the 
Follower?s acknowledgement, however. She imi-
tates the Router?s gesture but from her perspective 
as a potential observer. Also, at the level of single 
form features, she performs the gesture differently. 
(different movement direction, different symmetry) 
The imitating gesture overlaps with her nod and 
her contribution OK. It is important to see that her 
gesture provides m
townhall could possibly give. It refers at the same 
time to the town-hall (standing for a discourse ref-
erent) and provides the information of a U-shape 
indicating property, in other words, it expresses the 
propositional information ?This building being U-
shaped? with this building acting as a definite 
anaphora to the occurrence of a building in the first 
part of the Router?s contribution. Hence, assessed 
from a dialogue perspective the following happens: 
The grounding process triggered by the Follower?s 
acknowledgement amounts to mutual belief among 
Router and Follower that the town hall is U-shaped 
and the approaching on-looker on the route per-
ceives it from the open side of the U.

lower?s gestures and their crucial exchange in terms of

edgement.

5 Extending the Simulation: The Under-
standing-Acceptance/Generation Cycle 
How can we go beyond the simulation of isolated 
speaker-specific gestures towards the generation of 
gestures in dialogues? We build on our findings in 
 the corpus study, briefly taken up here again (see
list in section 2 and the respective comments): 
Gesture helps in structuring the dialogue support-
n
ment of the current speaker?s (Router?s or Fol-
 
re 5 (R1) and the sub-
e fact that the BDN 
-
ing next speaker selection or indicating non-regular 
co tributions of other speaker. It enables assess-
lower?s) communicative intentions by the ad-
dressee, for example of whether the Router wants 
to keep the turn but indicates current memory and 
recapitulation problems thus appealing to the ad-
dressee?s cooperation. In addition, appraisal of the 
reliability of the information given by the Router 
can be read off from some of the Router?s gestures. 
Finally, as shown in section 4, gestures comple-
menting or even replacing verbal information is 
used in acknowledgements. 
Building on these observations, our goal is to 
simulate such dialogic interaction with two virtual 
agents (Router and Follower), each of whom pro-
vided with a speaker-specific GNetIc model. In the 
minimal discourse example Router and Follower  
use similar gestures which, notably, differ with 
respect to some details (e.g. speaker?s perspective). 
In the simulation we essentially capture the 
Router?s contribution in Figu
sequent acknowledgement by the Follower (F1). In 
order to vary the Router?s gesturing behavior we 
use the representation technique of drawing instead 
of shaping in the simulation. 
What we need to extend the model with is an 
analysis of the Follower?s understanding of the 
Router?s gesture. Psychologically plausible but 
beyond commonly specialised technical ap-
proaches, we want to employ the same model of an 
agent?s ?gesture knowledge? for both generating 
and understanding gestures. For an overview of the 
production and understanding cycle see Figure 6.  
Here we can make use of th
formalism allows for two different types of infer-
ence, causal inferences that follow the causal inter 
actions from cause to effect, and diagnostic infer-
ences that allow for introducing evidence for ef-
fects and infer the most likely causes of these ef-
fects. This bi-directional use of BDNs could be 
complementary to approaches of plan/intention 
recognition such as in Geib and Goldman (2003). 
To model a use of gestures for regulation as ob-
served with the Follower F1, the Router agent?s 
gestural activity is set as evidence for the output 
nodes of the Follower?s BDN. A diagnostic infer-
ence then yields the most likely causes, that is, the 
most likely referent properties and values of dis-
course contextual variables. In other words, we 
employ the same speaker-specific GNetIc model 
for generation and for understanding. That is, in
formation about the physical appearance of the 
 
94
 Router?s gesture (as specified in Figure 4) is pro-
vided as evidence for the Follower?s GNetIc model 
revealing?correctly?that the gesture?s representa-
tion technique is ?drawing? and the shape property 
is ?U-shaped?.  
Notably, just as the gesture generation process has 
to make choices between similarly probable alter-
natives, not all diagnostic inferences which are 
drawn by employing the Follower agent?s GNetIc 
model are necessarily in line with the evidence 
from which the Router agent?s gesture was origi-
nally generated. For instance, the communicative 
goal as inferred by the Follower agent is 
?lmDescrPosition? (with a likelihood of .65) in-
simulate such iconic ges-
nts 
gue structure such as 
ext speaker selection or acknowledgement and 
outer?s 
e? 
posed in classical CA research 
back 
 participants 
stead of ?lmDescrProperty?. Nevertheless, the in-
ferred knowledge reveals an underspecified repre-
sentation of the referent (see Figure 7) as well as 
the most likely specification of the discourse con-
text. That way, the Follower agent develops his 
own hypothesis of the Router agent?s communica-
tive goal and the content being depicted gesturally.  
This hypothesis is forwarded to the follower 
agent?s dialogue manager, which responds to such 
declaratives by the Router with an acknowledge-
ment grounding act. Now the very same generation 
process as described in section 3 sets in. The Fol-
lower agent?s feedback is generated by employing 
his GNetIc model for causal inference. The result-
ing gesture is, notably, different from the Router 
agent?s gesture: it is a two-handed shaping gesture 
with handshape ASL-C. Movement type and 
movement features are the same as in the Router 
agent?s drawing gesture. Palm and BoH orientation 
are different due to representation technique spe-
cific patterns which are implemented in the deci-
sion nodes (see Figure 7). This case of using iconic 
gesture for regulating dialogue has been success-
fully implemented using GNetIc and the overall

6 Discussion and further research agenda 
In this paper we addressed the dialogue-regulating 
function of gestures. Based on empirical observa-
tions of interactional patterns from the SAGA cor-
pus, the starting points for the simulation of these 
gestures were non-interactional propositional ones 
such as iconics used to describe routes or land-
marks. We achieved to 
tures used in their function as acknowledgeme
shown in section 3 which clearly transcends their 
mere representational task. 
 
 
Figure 7: Imagistic representation of what the Follower un-
derstood from the Router?s gestural depiction of the townhall 
(left) and the simulation of the Follower?s autonomously gen-
erated shaping gesture used as an acknowledgement. 
 
We first note that we draw a distinction between 
gestures relevant for dialo
n
those which focus on influencing the social climate 
among the dialogue participants. We did not have 
many of the latter in SAGA but observed some 
which we classified as ?calming down? and ?don?t 
bother?. In certain communication cultures also 
touching the other?s body is accepted. 
As for a research agenda to elucidate further the 
functions of gestures in dialogue, we do not go too 
deeply into matters of dialogue theory here. We 
already have shown that gestures accompanying 
base-line information, being part of the R
report or the Follower?s uptake can be modelled in 
PTT (Poesio and Rieser 2009, Rieser and Poesio 
2009), if one assumes a unified representation for 
verbal and gestural meaning. Here we concentrate 
on how the simulation work can be pushed forward 
based on theoretical analyses of empirical data.  
Note that on the list of discourse gestures given in 
section 2 the following items are tied to Router?s 
behaviour and can be generated in an autonomous 
fashion: 
? managing of own turn 
? evidentials for establishing a confidence 
level 
? assessment of relevance by discourse par-
ticipants 
? indication of topicality with respect to time, 
place or objects.  
Observe, however, that these will also have an im-
pact on the mental state of the Follower as is e.g., 
obvious for evidentials or the ?brush away gestur
(Figure 1). Relevant for the sequencing of multi-
modal contributions are clearly the following: 
? mechanisms of next-speaker selection as 
pro
? grounding acts and feed
? handling of non-canonical moves by dis-
course

 ? clarification requests to work on contribu-
tions.
