Abstract
This paper describes the development of
French?English and English?French ma-
chine translation systems for the 2010
WMT shared task evaluation. These sys-
tems were standard phrase-based statisti-
cal systems based on the Moses decoder,
trained on the provided data only. Most
of our efforts were devoted to the choice
and extraction of bilingual data used for
training. We filtered out some bilingual
corpora and pruned the phrase table. We
also investigated the impact of adding two
types of additional bilingual texts, ex-
tracted automatically from the available
monolingual data. We first collected bilin-
gual data by performing automatic trans-
lations of monolingual texts. The second
type of bilingual text was harvested from
comparable corpora with Information Re-
trieval techniques.
1 Introduction
This paper describes the machine translation sys-
tems developed by the Computer Science labora-
tory at the University of Le Mans (LIUM) for the
2010 WMT shared task evaluation. We only con-
sidered the translation between French and En-
glish (in both directions). The main differences
with respect to previous year?s system (Schwenk
et al, 2009) are as follows: restriction to the data
recommended for the workshop, usage of the (fil-
tered) French?English gigaword bitext, pruning of
the phrase table, and usage of automatic trans-
lations of the monolingual news corpus to im-
prove the translation model. We also used a larger
amount of bilingual data extracted from compara-
ble corpora than was done in 2009. These different
points are described in the rest of the paper, to-
gether with a summary of the experimental results
showing the impact of each component.
2 Resources Used
The following sections describe how the resources
provided or allowed in the shared task were used
to train the translation and language models of the
system.
2.1 Bilingual data
Our system was developed in two stages. First,
a baseline system was built to generate automatic
translations of some of the monolingual data avail-
able. These automatic translations may be used
directly with the source texts to build additional
bitexts, or as queries of an Information Retrieval
(IR) system to extract new bitexts from compara-
ble corpora. In a second stage, these additional
bilingual data were incorporated to the system (see
Section 4 and Tables 1 and 2).
The latest version of the News-Commentary
(NC) corpus, of the Europarl (Eparl) corpus (ver-
sion 5), and of the United Nations (UN) corpus
were used. We also took as training data a sub-
set of the French?English Gigaword (109) cor-
pus. Since a significant part of the data was
crawled from the web, we thought that many sen-
tence pairs may be only approximate translations
of each other. We applied a lexical filter to dis-
card them. Furthermore, some sentences of this
corpus were extracted from web page menus and
are not grammatical. Although we could have
used a part of the menu items as a dictionary, for
simplicity we applied an n-gram language model
(LM) filter to remove all non-grammatical sen-
tences. Thanks to this filter, sentences out of the
language model domain (in this case, mainly the
news domain), may also have been discarded be-
cause they contain many unknown or unfrequent
n-grams. The lexical filter was based on the IBM
model 1 cost (Brown et al, 1993) of each side of
a sentence pair given the other side, normalised
with respect to both sentence lengths. This filter
121
was trained on a corpus composed of Eparl, NC,
and UN data. The language model filter was an
n-gram LM cost of the target sentence (see Sec-
tion 3), normalised with respect to its length. This
filter was trained with all monolingual resources
available except the 109 data. We generated a first
subset, 1091, selecting sentence pairs with a lexi-
cal cost inferior to 4 and an LM cost inferior to
2.3. The corpus selected in this way contains 115
million words in the English side (out of 580 mil-
lion in the original corpus). Close to the evaluation
deadline we decided to generate a second corpus
(1092) by raising the LM cost threshold to 2.6. The
1092 corpus contains 232 million words on the En-
glish side (twice as much as in the 1091 corpus).
In the French side of the bilingual corpora, for
the French?English direction only, the contrac-
tions ?du? (?of the?), ?au? and ?aux? (?to the? singu-
lar and plural) were substituted by their expanded
forms (?de le?, ?a` le? and ?a` les?).
2.2 Use of Automatic Translations and
Comparable corpora
Available human translated bitexts such as the UN
corpus seem to be out-of domain for this task.
We used two types of automatically extracted re-
sources to adapt our system to the task domain.
First, we generated automatic translations of the
French News corpus provided (231M words), and
selected the sentences with a normalised transla-
tion cost (returned by the decoder) inferior to a
threshold. The resulting bitext has no new words
in the English side, since all words of the transla-
tion output come from the translation model, but
it contains new combinations (phrases) of known
words, and reinforces the probability of some
phrase pairs (Schwenk, 2008).
Second, as in last year?s evaluation, we auto-
matically extracted and aligned parallel sentences
from comparable in-domain corpora. This year
we used the AFP and APW news texts since there
are available in the French and English LDC Gi-
gaword corpora. The general architecture of our
parallel sentence extraction system is described in
detail by Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk (2009). We
first translated 91M words from French into En-
glish using our first stage SMT system. These En-
glish sentences were then used to search for trans-
lations in the English AFP and APW texts of the
Gigaword corpus using information retrieval tech-
niques. The Lemur toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan,
2001) was used for this purpose. Search was lim-
ited to a window of ?5 days of the date of the
French news text. The retrieved candidate sen-
tences were then filtered using the Translation Er-
ror Rate (TER) with respect to the automatic trans-
lations. In this study, sentences with a TER be-
low 65% for the French?English system and 75%
for the English?French system were kept. Sen-
tences with a large length difference (French ver-
sus English) or containing a large fraction of num-
bers were also discarded. By these means, about
15M words of additional bitexts were obtained to
include in the French?English system, and 21M
words to include in the English?French system.
Note that these additional bitexts do not depend
on the translation direction. The most suitable
amount of additional data was just different in
the French?English and English?French transla-
tion directions.
2.3 Monolingual data
The French and English target language models
were trained on all provided monolingual data. In
addition, LDC?s Gigaword collection was used for
both languages. Data corresponding to the devel-
opment and test periods were removed from the
Gigaword collections.
2.4 Development data
All development was done on news-test2008, and
newstest2009 was used as internal test set. For all
corpora except the French side of the bitexts used
to train the French?English system (see above),
the default Moses tokenization was used. How-
ever, we added abbreviations for the French tok-
enizer. All our models are case sensitive and in-
clude punctuation. The BLEU scores reported in
this paper were calculated with the multi-bleu.perl
tool and are case sensitive. The BLEU score
was one of metrics with the best correlation with
human ratings in last year evaluation (Callison-
Burch et al, 2009) for the French?English and
English?French directions.
3 Architecture of the SMT system
The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT)
is to produce a target sentence e from a source
sentence f . It is today common practice to use
phrases as translation units (Koehn et al, 2003;
Och and Ney, 2003) and a log linear framework in
order to introduce several models explaining the
122
translation process:
e? = argmax
e
p(e|f)
= argmax
e
{exp(
?
i
?ihi(e, f))} (1)
The feature functions hi are the system mod-
els and the ?i weights are typically optimized to
maximize a scoring function on a development
set (Och and Ney, 2002). In our system fourteen
features functions were used, namely phrase and
lexical translation probabilities in both directions,
seven features for the lexicalized distortion model,
a word and a phrase penalty and a target language
model (LM).
The system is based on the Moses SMT toolkit
(Koehn et al, 2007) and constructed as follows.
First, word alignments in both directions are cal-
culated. We used a multi-threaded version of the
GIZA++ tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008).1 This speeds
up the process and corrects an error of GIZA++
that can appear with rare words.
Phrases and lexical reorderings are extracted
using the default settings of the Moses toolkit.
The parameters of Moses were tuned on news-
test2008, using the ?new? MERT tool. We repeated
the training process three times, each with a differ-
ent seed value for the optimisation algorithm. In
this way we have an rough idea of the error intro-
duced by the tuning process.
4-gram back-off LMs were used. The word
list contains all the words of the bitext used to
train the translation model and all words that ap-
pear at least ten times in the monolingual corpora.
Words of the monolingual corpora containing spe-
cial characters or sequences of uppercase charac-
ters were not included in the word list. Separate
LMs were build on each data source with the SRI
LM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) and then linearly in-
terpolated, optimizing the coefficients with an EM
procedure. The perplexities of these LMs were
103.4 for French and 149.2 for English.
4 Results and Discussion
The results of our SMT system for the French?
English and English?French tasks are summarized
in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The MT metric
scores are the average of three optimisations per-
formed with different seeds (see Section 3). The

edu/?qing/
numbers in parentheses are the standard deviation
of these three values. The standard deviation gives
a lower bound of the significance of the difference
between two systems. If the difference between
two average scores is less than the sum of the stan-
dard deviations, we can say that this difference is
not significant. The reverse is not true. Note that
most of the improvements shown in the tables are
small and not significant. However many of the
gains are cumulative and the sum of several small
gains makes a significant difference.
Phrase-table Pruning
We tried to prune the phrase-table as proposed by
Johnson et. al. (2007), and available in moses
(?sigtest-filter?). We used the ? ?  filter2. As
lines 3 and 4 of Table 1, and lines 3 and 4 of Ta-
ble 2 reveal, in addition to the reduction 43% of
the phrase-table, a small gain in BLEU score (0.15
and 0.11 respectively) was obtained with the prun-
ing.
Baseline French?English System
The first section of Table 1 (lines 1 to 5) shows re-
sults of the development of the baseline SMT sys-
tem, used to generate automatic translations. Al-
though being out-of-domain data, the introduction
of the UN corpus yields an improvement of one
BLEU point with respect to Eparl+NC. Adding the
1091 corpus, we gain 0.7 BLEU point more. Ac-
tually, we obtained the same score with the 1091
added directly to Eparl+NC (line 5). However, we
choose to include the UN corpus to generate trans-
lations to have a larger vocabulary. The system
highlighted in bold (line 4) is the one we choose
to generate our English translations.
Although no French translations were gener-
ated, we did similar experiments in the English?
French direction (lines 1 to 4 of Table 2). In this
direction, the 1091 corpus is still more valuable than
the UN corpus when added to Eparl+NC, but with
less difference in terms of BLEU score. In this di-
2The p-value of two-by-two contingency tables (describ-
ing the degree of association between a source and a target
phrase) is calculated with Fisher exact test. This probability
is interpreted as the probability of observing by chance an as-
sociation that is at least as strong as the given one, and hence
as its significance. An important special case of a table oc-
curs when a phrase pair occurs exactly once in the corpus,
and each of the component phrases occurs exactly once in its
side of the parallel corpus (1-1-1 phrase pairs). In this case
the negative log of the p-value is ? = logN (N is number of
sentence pairs in the corpus). ? ?  is the largest threshold
that results in all of the 1-1-1 phrase pairs being included.
123
rection, we obtain a gain by adding the UN corpus
to Eparl+NC+1091.
Filtering the 109 Corpus
Lines 5 to 7 of Table 1 show the impact of filtering
the 109 corpus. The system trained on the full 109
corpus added to Eparl+NC achieves a BLEU score
of 26.83. Substituting the full 109 corpus by 1091 (5
times smaller), i.e. using the first filtering settings,
we gain 0.13 BLEU point. Using 1092 instead of
1091, we gain another 0.16 BLEU point, that is 0.3
in total. With respect to not using the 109 data at
all (as we did last year), we gain 0.8 BLEU point.
Impact of the Additional Bitexts
With the baseline French?English SMT system
(see above), we translated the French News cor-
pus to generated an additional bitext (News). We
also translated some parts of the French LDC Gi-
gaword corpus, to serve as queries to our IR sys-
tem (see section 2.2). The resulting additional bi-
text is referred to as IR. Lines 8 to 13 of Table 1
and lines 6 to 12 of Table 2 summarize the system
development including the additional bitexts.
With the News additional bitext added to
Eparl+NC, we obtain a system of similar perfor-
mance as the baseline system used to generate
the automatic translations, but with less than 30%
of the data. This holds in both translation direc-
tions. Adding the News corpus to a larger corpus,
such as Eparl+NC+1091, has less impact but still
yields some improvement: 0.15 BLEU point in
French?English and 0.3 in English?French. Thus,
the News bitext translated from French to English
may have more impact when translating from En-
glish to French than in the opposite direction. Note
that the number of additional phrase-table entries
per additional running word is twice as high for
the News bitext than for the other corpora. For
example, with respect to Eparl+NC+UN+1091 (Ta-
ble 2), Eparl+NC+UN+1091+News has 56M more
words and 116M more entries in the phrase-table,
thus the ratio is more than 2. For all other cor-
pora, the ratio is equal to 1 or less. This is un-
expected, particularly in this case where the News
bitext has no new English vocabulary with respect
to the Eparl+NC+UN+1091 corpus, from which its
English side was generated.
With the IR additional bitext added to
Eparl+NC, we obtain a system of similar perfor-
mance as the system trained on Eparl+NC+UN,
while the IR bitext is 10 times smaller than the
UN corpus. Added to Eparl+NC+1091+News, the
IR bitext allows gains of 0.13 and 0.2 BLEU point
respectively in the French?English and English?
French directions.
Comparing the systems trained on
Eparl+NC+1091 or Eparl+NC+10
9
2 to the sys-
tems trained on the same corpora plus News+IR,
we can estimate the cumulative impact of the
additional bitexts. The gain is around 0.3 BLEU
point for French?English and around 0.5 BLEU
point for English?French.
Final System
In both translation directions our best system was
the one trained on Eparl+NC+1092+News+IR. We
further achieved small improvements (0.3 BLEU
point) by pruning the phrase-table (as above) and
by using a language model with no cut-off together
with increasing the beam size and/or the maxi-
mum number of translation table entries per input
phrase. Note that the English LM with cut-off had
a size of 6G, and the one with no cut-off had a
size of 29G. It was too much to fit in our 72G
machines so we pruned it with the SRILM prun-
ing tool down to a size of 19G. The French LM
with cut-off had a size of 2G and the one with
no cut-off had a size of 9G. These sizes corre-
spond to the binary format. Taking as example the
French?English direction, the running time went
from 8600 seconds for the system of line 14 (with
a threshold pruning coefficient of 0.4 and a LM
with cut-off) to 28200 seconds for the system sub-
mitted (with the LM without cut-off pruned by the
SRILM tool and a threshold pruning coefficient of
0.00001).
5 Conclusions and Further Work
We presented the development of our machine
translation system for the French?English and
English?French 2010 WMT shared task. Our sys-
tem was actually a standard phrase-based SMT
system based on the Moses decoder. Its original-
ity mostly lied in the choice and extraction of the
training data used.
We decided to use a part of the 109 French?
English corpus. We found this resource useful,
even without filtering. We nevertheless gained 0.3
BLEU point by selecting sentences based on an
IBM Model 1 filter and a language model filter.
We pruned the phrase table with the ?sigtest-
filter? distributed in Moses, yielding improve-

ments of 0.1 to 0.2 BLEU point for a 43% reduc-
tion of the phrase-table size.
We used additional bitexts extracted automati-
cally from the available monolingual corpora. The
first type of additional bitext is generated with au-
tomatic translations of the monolingual data with
a baseline SMT system. The second one is ex-
tracted from comparable corpora, with Informa-
tion Retrieval techniques. With the additional bi-
texts we gained 0.3 and 0.5 BLEU point for the
French?English and English?French systems, re-
spectively.
Next year we want to perform an improved se-
lection of parallel training data with re-sampling
techniques. We also want to use a continuous
space language model (Schwenk, 2007) in an n-
best list rescoring step after decoding. Finally, we
plan to train different types of systems (such as
a hierarchical SMT system and a Statistical Post-
Editing system) and combine their outputs with
the MANY open source system combination soft-
ware (Barrault, 2010).
