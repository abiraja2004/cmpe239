Abstract  
This paper presents a study of military applications of 
advanced speech processing technology which includes 
three major elements: (1) review and assessment of cur- 
rent efforts in military applications of speech technol- 
ogy; (2) identification of opportunities for future mili- 
tary applications of advanced speech technology; and (3) 
identification of problem areas where research in speech 
processing is needed to meet application requirements, 
and of current research thrusts which appear promising. 
The relationship of this study to previous assessments of 
military applications of speech technology is discussed, 
and substantial recent progress is noted. Current efforts 
in military applications of speech technology which are 
highlighted include: (1) narrowband (2400 b/s) and very 
low-rate (50-1200 b/s) secure voice communication; (2) 
voice/data integration in computer networks; (3) speech 
recognition in fighter aircraft, military helicopters, bat- 
tle management, and air traffic control training systems; 
and (4) noise and interference r moval for human listen- 
ers. Opportunities for advanced applications are identi- 
fied by means of descriptions of several generic systems 
which would be possible with advances in speech tech- 
nology and in system integration. These generic systems 
include: (1) integrated multi-rate voice/data commu- 
nications terminal; (2) interactive speech enhancement 
system; (3) voice-controlled pilot's associate system; (4) 
advanced air traffic control training systems; (5) battle 
management command and control support system with 
spoken natural language interface; and (6) spoken lan- 
guage translation system. In identifying problem areas 
and research efforts to meet application requirements, 
it is observed that some of the most promising research 
involves the integration of speech algorithm techniques 
including speech coding, speech recognition, and speaker 
recognition. 
1 Int roduct ion  and Summary  
This paper is the result of a study of military appli- 
cations of advanced speech processing technology which 
has been undertaken with the following goals: (1) to

and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 
review and assess a representative sampling of current 
efforts in military applications of advanced speech pro- 
cessing technology; (2) to identify opportunities for new 
military applications, or further development of current 
applications; and (3) to identify areas where improve- 
ments to speech processing technology are needed to 
address military problems. The intention is to outline 
a fairly broad range of applications, opportunities and 
speech technology areas; however, the coverage is not 
intended to be fully comprehensive, nor to be very de- 
tailed in any particular area. Numerous references are 
provided, on other survey articles, on specific applica- 
tions and technologies, and on pertinent research efforts. 
An historical point of reference for this paper is the 
1977 paper by Beek, Neuburg, and Hodge \[10\], which 
assessed speech recognition and speech processing tech- 
nology for military applications. A great deal has been 
accomplished since 1977 both in speech technology and 
in applications, but the generic application areas iden- 
tified in that earlier paper generally remain as relevant 
now as they were in 1977. 
The organization of this paper is as follows. A 
framework for the paper is first developed by outlining 
key speech technology areas and key categories of mili- 
tary applications, and identifying which technologies are 
needed for each category of application. Several previ- 
ous assessments of military applications of speech tech- 
nology are then reviewed, and the relationship of this 
study to those assessments is discussed. A representative 
sampling of current work in the key military application 
areas is then summarized and assessed. A set of oppor- 
tunities for advanced applications are then identified and 
described; the approach is to describe several generic sys- 
tems which would be possible with advances in speech 
technology and in system integration. This description 
Of application opportunities i  followed by a brief outline 
of areas where improvements are needed in speech tech- 
nology to meet the challenges of military applications, 
and notes several major technology development efforts 
which are in progress. Finally, conclusions and areas for 
further study are discussed.

nologies and Military Applica- 
tion Areas 
An outline of speech technology areas which are of im- 
portance for military (and non-military) applications i
presented in Table 1. All these areas are subjects for on- 
going research and development. Summaries of the tech- 
nology are presented in a variety of textbooks and sum- 
mary papers, and ongoing developments are presented 
at the annual ICASSP conferences and in other forums. 
Although the terms used in Table 1 are generally well 
known, they will be defined, as needed, later in this pa- 
per in the context of discussions of particular applica- 
tions.

3 Relationship to Previous As- 
sessments of Military Applica- 
tions of Speech Technology 
3.1 Beek ,  Neuburg ,  and  Hodge (197"7) 
This paper \[10\] provided a comprehensive r view of the 
state-of-the-art of speech technology and military appli- 
cations as of 1977. It serves as a useful reference point for 
the present paper. The authors grouped potential mil- 
itary applications into four major categories: (1) secu- 
rity (including access control and surveillance); (2) com- 
mand and control; (3) data transmission and communi- 
cation; and (4) processing distorted speech. Other than 
the training application (which was mentioned briefly in 
the Beek, et al, paper), these categories cover all the 
application areas listed in Table 2. 
Most of the applications cited in the 1977 review were 
in the research and development stage, and a daunt- 
ing list of unsolved problems was cited. Much progress 
has been made since 1977 in speech technology (both 
algorithms, and hardware implementations of these al- 
gorithms) and in applications. The following areas of 
progress are worthy of particular note: 
1. Digital Narrowband Communicat ion Sys- 
434 
terns - -  The Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) al- 
gorithm was relatively new in 1977. Improvements 
in technology and the coding algorithm have now 
led to widespread eployment of digital narrowband 
secure voice, especially by means of the STU-III 
(secure terminal unit) family of equipment at 2.4 
kb/s. In addition, significant progress has been 
made in developing practical coders for lower rates 
using Vector Quantization (i.e., pattern matching) 
techniques. 
2. Automat ic  Speech Recognit ion - -  Major ad- 
vances both in CSR and IWR have been made 
largely through the widescale development of 
statistically-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
techniques, as well as through the development and 
application of dynamic time warping (DTW) recog- 
nition techniques. ItMM techniques which were pio- 
neered prior to 1977, have in recent years been fur- 
ther developed at a large number of laboratories, 
with significant advances both in recognition per- 
formance and in efficiency of implementation. A
sampling of basic references on DTW and tIMM is 
provided by \[6,21,59,60,113\]. \[94\] provides a good 
overview of speech recognition technology, and has 
many useful references. A comprehensive bibliog- 
raphy on speech recognition has recently been pub- 
lished \[53\]. 
3. Noise and Interference Reduct ion - -  Work in 
application of digital speech processing to noise and 
interference reduction was relatively new in 1977, 
and has progressed significantly since that time 
\[89\]. Hardware systems for speech enhancement 
have been developed \[28,153\] and have been shown 
to improve both speech readability and ASR perfor- 
mance under certain conditions of noise and inter- 
ference. 
3.2 Woodard  and  Cupp les  (1983)  
This paper \[159\] did not attempt a comprehensive r - 
view of the state-of-the-art, but instead described se- 
lected military applications in three areas: (1) voice in- 
put for command and control; (2) message sorting by 
voice; and (3) very-low-bit-rate voice communications. 
Current and future applications in the first and third 
areas will be discussed in some detail in the following 
discussions. For a general discussion of message sorting 
and surveillance, the reader is referred to \[159\]. 
3 .3 Other  Rev iews  o f  M i l i ta ry  App l i ca -  
t ions  o f  Speech  Techno logy  
The 1984 National Research Council report by Flana- 
gan, et al, \[38\] contains an excellent review of speech 
recognition system applications to data base manage- 
ment, command and control of weapons ystems, and 
training; a categorization of applications i included, as 
well as a number of specific case studies. Beek and 
Vonusa (1983) \[14\] provide a general review of military 
applications of speech technology, with substantial up- 
dates from the 1977 Beck, et al, paper referred to above. 
An early, but comprehensive, assessment of potential 
military applications of speech understanding systems, 
is provided by Turn, et al, in 1974 \[143\]. The book by 
Lea \[68\] contains useful discussions on both military and 
non-military applications of speech recognition. Other 
applications overviews are presented in \[11,12,13\]. Tay- 
lor (1986) \[140\] provides a more updated review of avion- 
ics applications of speech technology. The Proceedings 
of Military Speech Technology Conferences (1986-1989) 
contain a substantial number of useful summaries of spe- 
cific work in a variety of applications areas. A recent 
update on military applications of audio processing and 
speech recognition is provided in \[29\]. 
3.4 The  NATO Research  Study  Group 
on  Speech  Process ing  
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Re- 
search Study Group on Speech Processing (RSG10) \[87\], 
originally formed in 1977, has as one of its major con- 
tinuing objectives the identification and analysis of po- 
tential military applications of advanced technology. In 
fact the preparation of this paper has been motivated 
by the author's association with RSG10 since 1986 as 
a "technical specialist" in the speech area; much useful 
information for the paper has been provided by other 
RSG10 members, or learned during RSG10 site visits to 
various laboratories in the member NATO countries. 
The RSG10 group has frequently been involved in the 
past in activities aimed at disseminating information 
about speech technology, and military applications in 
particular, to a wider community. For example, in 1983 
the group participated in a NATO Advisory Group for 
Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD) lecture 
series on speech processing \[2\] which included a number 
of important papers on military applications of speech 
recognition \[14,20\]. A similar lecture series was con- 
ducted in 1990, and the papers in that series \[3\] represent 
an up-to-date overview of a number of important opics 
in speech analysis/synthesis and recognition systems for 
military applications. 
In another project, RSG10 established in 1983 a work- 
ing group to look at the human factors aspects of voice 
input/output systems, which are clearly critical to mili- 
tary (or non-military) applications. A workshop on this 
subject ook place in 1986, resulting in a comprehensive 
book \[141\] with papers representative of the state-of-the- 
art in research and applications in the area of multimodal 
person/machine dialogs including voice. 
In addition to its work in assessing speech technology 
and opportunities for military applications, RSG10 has 
continued to initiate and conduct avariety of cooperative 
international projects \[87\], particularly in the areas of 
speech recognition in adverse nvironments, peech data 
base collection, speech recognition performance assess- 
ment, and human factors issues in speech input/output 
435 
systems. 
4 Current Work in Development 
of Military Applications of 
Speech Technology 
Introduction and Summary 
This section summarizes and assesses a representa- 
tive sampling of current work in military applications 
of speech technology in the following areas: (1) narrow- 
band (2400 b/s-4800 b/s) and low-bit-rate (50-1200 b/s) 
secure digital voice communications; (2)speech recogni- 
tion systems in fighter aircraft, military helicopters, bat- 
tle management, and air traffic control training; and (3) 
noise and interference suppression. 
4.2 Narrowband Secure Voice for Tacti- 
cal Applications 
Most applications of narrowband voice coders at 2.4 
kb/s (e.g., STU-III) have been in office environments 
where background acoustic noise and other environmen- 
tal effects are not major problems. Operational military 
platforms uch as fighter aircraft, helicopters, airborne 
command posts, and tanks, pose additional challenges 
since the performance ofnarrowband algorithms tend to 
be sensitive to noise and distortion both in talker and 
listener environments. However, substantial progress 
has been made in developing the voice algorithm, mi- 
crophone, and system integration technology for tacti- 
cal deployment of 2.4 kb/s voice. Examples include the 
Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) 
narrowband voice efforts in the U.S. \[123,142\] and in 
the U.K. \[125\], and the development of the Advanced 
Narrowband Digital Voice Terminal (ANDVT) family of 
equipment \[134\] for a variety of environments. 
4.1 D ig i ta l  Nar rowband Secure  Vo ice  - 
the  STU- I I I  
Beck, et al, noted in 1977 \[10\] that "a massive ffort 
is underway to develop and implement an all-digital (se- 
cure narrowband speech) communication system." The 
development and widespread deployment ofthe STU-III 
as described by Nagengast \[88\] has brought his effort 
to fruition, and probably represents he single most sig- 
nificant operational military application of speech tech- 
nology. The STU-III represents a marriage of a sophis- 
ticated speech algorithm, the Linear Predictive Coding 
(LPC) technique at 2.4 kb/s, with very large-scale inte- 
gration (VLSI) digital signal processor (DSP) technology 
to allow development of a secure terminal which is small 
enough and low enough in cost to be widely used for se- 
cure voice communication ver telephone circuits in the 
United States. It is worth noting that although the STU- 
III includes recent improvements in the LPC algorithm, 
the basic algorithm for 2.4 kb/s LPC has not changed 
significantly over the last ten years. The primary factor 
which has allowed its widespread application has been 
progress in VLSI technology. 
Although the 2.4 kb/s LPC algorithm in STU-III pro- 
duces intelligible speech, it is not toll quality and cur- 
rent efforts are focussed on providing improved quality 
for secure voice, while maintaining the ability to trans- 
mit over standard telephone circuits. Modern technology 
has evolved to the point where 4.8 kb/s is now generally 
supportable over the dial network. Hence, recent efforts 
have focussed, with some success (see \[66\]) on the de- 
velopment of 4.8 kb/s voice coders with higher quality 
than LPC. Based on this work, the Code-Excited LPC 
(CELP) technique has been proposed as a standard for 
4.8 kb/s secure voice communication \[24\]. CELP pro- 
vides a better epresentation f the excitation signal, at 
the cost of a higher bit rate, than the traditional pitch 
and voiced/unvoiced xcitation coding used in 2.4 kb/s 
LPC. 
4.3 Low-Bit-Rate (50-1200 b/s) Voice 
Communicat ions  
Significant advances both in speech algorithms and in 
VLSI technology have greatly enhanced the feasibility of 
intelligible, practical digital voice communication at low 
bit rates (i.e., _< 1200 b/s). These coders hould have im- 
portant applicability in a variety of strategic and tacti- 
cal systems, where channel bandwidth may be extremely 
limited. Developments in four bit rate ranges are of in- 
terest, and will be summarized briefly here. First, it has 
been demonstrated that frame-fill techniques \[16,85,98\] 
can be used very effectively to reduce a 2.4 kb/s algo- 
rithm to 1.2 kb/s operation, with little loss in speech 
performance, and little added complexity. Secondly, to 
enter the 600-800 b/s range, Vector Quantization (VQ) 
techniques have been successfully developed \[78\] which 
use pattern matching to reduce bit rate. The perfor- 
mance of these VQ systems tends to be sensitive to the 
speaker on which the patterns are trained, and adaptive 
training techniques \[99\] have been developed which effec- 
tively adapt the codebook of patterns to the speaker in 
real time. The third bit rate range of interest is 200-400 
b/s. Here, segment vocoder \[120\] and matrix vocoder 
techniques which use pattern matching over longer in- 
tervals (typically, 100 ms) have been developed. Al- 
though quality and intelligibility of these systems are 
marginal, practical real-time implementations are now 
feasible, and vocoders at this rate may be useful in se- 
lected applications where bandwidth is very limited \[49\]. 
Finally, to achieve even lower voice bit rates (say, 50 
b/s) it would be necessary to use speech recognition and 
synthesis techniques, with a restriction on vocabulary. 
These systems may be useful in selected applications \[63\] 
such as transmission of stereotyped reports from a for- 
ward observer post. Recognition/synthesis techniques 
may also be useful for two-way communication i  sit- 
uations where bandwidth is very limited in one direc- 
tion, but where real-time voice is possible (say, at 1200 
436 
b/s) in the other direction \[39\], allowing confirmation of 
the correctness of the transmissions which use recogni- 
tion/synthesis. 
4.4 Voice/Data Integration in Computer 
Networks 
The widespread evelopment ofcomputer networks us- 
ing packet switching technology has opened opportuni- 
ties for a variety of applications of speech technology, 
including: packet voice communications \[46,148\] with ef- 
ficient sharing of network resources for voice and data; 
advanced intelligent erminals \[39,104\] with multi-media 
communications; multi-media conferencing \[104\]; and 
voice control of resources and services (such as voice 
mail) in computer networks \[62,106\]. Since data com- 
munications using packet systems is becoming widely 
used in military systems, integration of voice and data 
on these networks provides ignificant advantages. Ap- 
plicable technologies are speech coding, speech recogni- 
tion, speech synthesis, and multiplexing techniques in- 
cluding (see \[148\]) Time-Assigned Speech Interpolation 
(TASI), which take advantage of the bursty nature of 
speech communications. 
4.5 Speech Recognition Systems in 
High-Performance Fighter Aircraft 
The pilot in a high-performance military aircraft op- 
erates in a heavy workload environment, where hands 
and eyes are busy and speech recognition could be of 
significant advantage. For example, the pilot could use 
a speech recognizer to set a radio frequency or to choose 
a weapon, without moving his hands or bringing his gaze 
inside the cockpit. This would allow the pilot to concen- 
trate more effectively on flying the airplane in combat 
situations. The potential improvement in pilot effective- 
ness could be extremely significant in critical situations. 
In view of the above, substantial efforts have been 
devoted over recent years to test and evaluate speech 
recognition in fighter aircraft. Of particular note are the 
U.S. program in speech recognition for the Advanced 
Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)/F-16 aircraft 
\[55,118,119,121,122,154,158\], the program in France on 
installing speech recognition systems on Mirage aircraft 
\[81,136,137,138\], andprograms in the U.K. dealing with 
a variety of aircraft platforms \[9,27,41,43,75,128,139,156, 
157\]. In these programs, speech recognizers have been 
operated successfully in fighter aircraft. Applications 
have included: setting radio frequencies, commanding 
an autopilot system, setting steerpoint coordinates and 
weapons release parameters, and controlling flight dis- 
plays. Generally, only very limited, constrained vocab- 
ularies have been used successfully, and a major effort 
has been devoted to integration of the speech recognizer 
with the avionics ystem. 
An excellent description of the roles and limitations 
of speech recognition systems in fighters, from the user's 
(i.e., the pilot's) point of view has been presented by 
AFTI/F-16 pilot Major John Howard \[55\]. Several 
points are worth noting here: 
1. speech recognition has definite potential for reduc- 
ing pilot workload, but this potential was not real- 
ized consistently; 
2. achievement of very high recognition accuracy (say, 
95% or more) was the most critical factor for making 
the speech recognition system useful - with lower 
recognition rates, pilots would not use the system; 
3. more natural vocabulary and grammar, and shorter 
training times would be useful, but only if very high 
recognition rates could be maintained. 
With respect o the first point above, the most encourag- 
ing result was that for some of the pilots (those for which 
high recognition rate was achieved), noticeable improve- 
ments in overall task performance were achieved with 
speech recognition for air-to-air tracking and for low- 
level navigation. A key goal (emphasized by the second 
point above) is to improve the recognition technology to 
make these improvements more consistent. Recent labo- 
ratory research in robust speech recognition for military 
environments \[100,101,114\] has produced promising re- 
sults which, if extendable to the cockpit, should improve 
the utility of speech recognition in high-performance air- 
craft. With respect o the development of vocabularies 
and grammars which will be well matched to the pilot's 
needs, a study at the U.S. Air Force Wright-Patterson 
Avionics Laboratory \[76,77\] obtained a great deal of use- 
ful data by having pilots conduct dialogs with a simu- 
lated speech recognition-based system, using mission sce- 
narious simulated in the laboratories. Other discussions 
of human factors and speech recognition requirements in 
the cockpit are provided in \[15,126\]. 
4.6 Speech Recognition Systems in He- 
licopter Environments 
The opportunities for speech recognition systems to im- 
prove pilot performance in military helicopters are sim- 
ilar to those in fighter aircraft. In a hands-busy, eyes- 
busy, heavy workload situation, speech recognition (as 
well as speech synthesis) could be of significant bene- 
fit to the pilot. Of course, the problems of achieving 
high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain 
strongly to the helicopter environment as well as to the 
fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actu- 
ally more severe in the helicopter environment, not only 
because of the high noise levels but also because the he- 
licopter pilot generally does not wear a facemask, which 
would reduce acoustic noise in the microphone. 
Substantial test and evaluation programs have been 
carried out in recent years in speech recognition sys- 
tems applications in helicopters, notably by the U.S. 
Army Avionics Research and Development Activity 
(AVRADA) \[51,105,115,135,155\] and by the Royal 
Aerospace Establishment (RAn) in the UK \[42,74,140\]. 
The program in France has included speech recognition 
437 
in the Puma helicopter \[138\]. Results have been en- 
couraging, and voice applications have included: control 
of communication radios; setting of navigation systems; 
and control of an automated target handover system 
(ATHS) which formats and sends air-air and air-ground 
messages, and has required a great deal of keyboard en- 
try. 
As in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice 
in helicopters i the impact on pilot effectiveness. En- 
couraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, 
where it was found \[135\] that pilots were generally able to 
run a prescribed course faster and more accurately when 
speech recognition for radio control was provided. How- 
ever, these results represent only a feasibility demonstra- 
tion in a test environment. Much remains to be done 
both in speech recognition \[80\] and in overall speech 
recognition technology, in order to consistently achieve 
performance improvements in operational settings. 
4.7 Speech  Recogn i t ion  Sys tems in Bat -  
t le  Management  
Battle management command centers generally require 
rapid access to and control of large, rapidly changing 
information databases. Commanders and system oper- 
ators need to query these databases as conveniently as 
possible, in an eyes-busy environment where much of 
the information is presented in display format. Human- 
machine interaction by voice has the potentiM to be 
very useful in these environments. A number of ef- 
forts have been undertaken to interface commerciMly- 
available isolated-word recognizers into battle manage- 
ment environments. For example Hale \[47\] describes the 
use of a limited vocabulary recognizer for voice recogni- 
tion control of a weapons control workstation i  a com- 
mand and control aboratory. Although the system ca- 
pability was limited, the users reported that the voice 
recognition provided potential convenience in avoiding 
the need to redirect eyes between screen and keyboard. 
In another feasibility study \[107\], speech recognition 
equipment was tested in conjunction with an integrated 
information display for naval battle management appli- 
cations. Again, users were very optimistic about the 
potential of the system, although capabilities were lim- 
ited. Another limited application of speech recognition 
in naval battle management is described in \[103\]. 
Clearly, battle management applications of speech 
recognition systems have high potential; but in order 
to fully realize this potential, a much more natural 
speech interface (continuous speech, natural grammar) 
is needed. The current speech understanding programs 
sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) in the U.S. has focussed on this prob- 
lem in the context of a naval resource management task. 
Speech recognition efforts have focussed on a continuous- 
speech, large-vocabulary database \[108\] which is de- 
signed to be representative of the naval resource man- 
agement task. Significant advances in the state-of-the- 
art in CSR have been achieved, and current efforts are 
focussed on integrating speech recognition and natural 
language processing to allow spoken language interaction 
with a naval resource management system. Much of this 
work is described in the Proceedings of recent DARPA 
Speech Recognition and Natural Language Workshops 
\[31,32,33\]. 
4.8 Tra in ing  o f  A i r  T ra f f l c  Cont ro l le rs  
Training for military (or civilian) air traffic controllers 
(ATC) represents an excellent application for speech 
recognition systems. Many ATC training systems cur- 
rently require a person to act as a "pseudo-pilot", en- 
gaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, 
which simulates the dialog which the controller would 
have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. 
Speech recognition and synthesis techniques offer the 
potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as 
pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support person- 
nel \[20,48,50,127\]. Air controller tasks are also charac- 
terized by highly structured speech as the primary out- 
put of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the 
speech recognition task. The U.S. Naval Training Equip- 
ment Center has sponsored a number of developments of 
prototype ATC trainers using speech recognition. An 
excellent overview of this work is presented in \[20\], and 
further discussion of the results is presented in \[38\]. Gen- 
erally, the recognition accuracy falls short of providing 
graceful interaction between the trainee and the system. 
However, the prototype training systems demonstrated 
a significant potential for voice interaction i  these sys- 
tems, and in other training applications. The U.S. Navy 
is currently sponsoring a large-scale effort in ATC train- 
ing systems \[127\], where a commercial speech recogni- 
tion unit \[146\] is being integrated with a complex train- 
ing system including displays and scenario creation. Al- 
though the recognizer is constrained in vocabulary, one 
of the goals of the training programs i to teach the con- 
trollers to speak in a constrained language, using specific 
vocabulary specifically designed for the ATC task. Re- 
cent research in France on application of speech recog- 
nition in ATC training systems, directed at issues both 
in speech recognition and in application of task-domain 
grammar constraints, is described in \[82,83,84,91\]. In ad- 
dition to the training application, speech recognition has 
a variety of other potential applications in ATC systems, 
as described, for example, in \[1\]. 
4.9 Remova l  o f  No ise  f rom Noise- 
Degraded Speech S igna ls  
There are a variety of military and non-military ap- 
plications where removal of noise and interference from 
speech signals is important, and a significant amount 
of work continues to be devoted to this area, both in 
technology development and in applications. A good 
summary of the field, with reprints of many important 
papers, is provided in Lim's book \[73\]. More recently, a
1989 National Research Council study \[89\] summarizes 
438 
the state-of-the-art in noise removal. Application areas 
identified in the study include: (1) two-way communi- 
cation by voice; (2) transcription of a single, important 
recording; and (3) transcription ofquantities of recorded 
material. The focus of the study is on speech processing 
to aid the human listener. The panel concluded that, al- 
though some noise reduction methods appear to improve 
speech quality in noise, intelligibility improvements had 
not been demonstrated using closed response tests such 
as the Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT). The committee 
recommended further research both on noise reduction 
algorithm development and on new testing procedures 
to assess not only intelligibility, but also to assess peech 
quality, fatigue, workload, and mental effort. 
In the area of noise removal, a sustained and successful 
effort has been sponsored by the Rome Air Development 
Center \[28,152,153,159\], which has led to the develop- 
ment of a fieldable development model called the Speech 
Enhancement Unit (SEU). The SEU has been tested un- 
der various realistic noise and interference conditions, 
and improvements in speech readability have been noted, 
as well as apparent reduction in operator fatigue. 
Prior to any attempts at digital processing for noise re- 
moval, it is clearly desirable to apply the most effective 
possible microphone technology to reduce the noise in 
the input to the digital system. The effectiveness of stan- 
dard noise-cancelling microphones is discussed briefly in 
\[142\]. Multi-microphone t chniques for noise reduction 
have been the subject of much recent work; \[147\] and 
\[116\] present examples of the work in this area. 
In combatting noise and interference in speech broad- 
cast and communication systems, it may be necessary 
and appropriate in certain situations to process the sig- 
nal before transmission rather than after reception. Re- 
cent work in this area, directed at improving listenabil- 
ity and range in a broadcast system, is described in 
\[110,112\]. 
Finally, recent work has also been successfully directed 
at advanced headphone t chnology \[19,44\] to reduce the 
noise in the ears of a listener in a high-noise nvironment. 
This work has important potential application for speech 
communications i  military environments such as fighter 
cockpits. 
4.10 Speaker  Recogn i t ion  and  Speaker  
Ver i f i ca t ion  
Automatic speech processing techniques for identifi- 
cation of people from their voice characteristics have a 
number of military and non-military applications, which 
are summarized in \[10\] and in \[35\]. These applications 
include: (1) security, where the task is to verify the iden- 
tity of an individual (e.g., for control of access to a re- 
stricted facility), and where the subject can often be 
instructed to speak a required phrase (this is referred 
to as "text-dependent" speaker verification); (2) surveil- 
lance of communciation channels \[10,35\], where the task 
is to identify a speaker from samples of unconstrained 
text ("text-independent" speaker ecognition); and (3) 
forensic applications, which can involve either a recog- 
nition or verification task, but where control over the 
available speech sample is often limited, and the poten- 
tial number of impostors (i.e., for a verification task) 
may be very large. Among the above applications, ecu- 
rity applications will yield the best speaker ecognition 
performance because of the cooperative user and con- 
trolled conditions. A case study of a reasonably success- 
ful operational speaker verification system, which has 
been used to control physical access into a corporate 
computer center, is described in \[35\], which points out 
some of the key problems and solutions in making a suc- 
cessful operational system. Current research efforts in 
speaker ecognition are generally being directed toward 
the more difficult text-independent speaker ecognition 
problem \[35,45,117\], with a goal of high performance un- 
der conditions of noise and channel distortion. 
4.11 Eva luat ion  o f  Speech  Process ing  
Systems 
Careful assessment of speech communication systems, 
speech synthesis ystems, and speech recognition sys- 
tems, using standard ata bases and quantitative evalu- 
ation measures, is clearly essential for making progress 
in speech technology for military or non-military appli- 
cations. Much attention has been directed at the assess- 
ment problem in recent years, and an extensive discus- 
sion is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the 
reader is referred to \[109\] for a comprehensive overview 
of speech quality assessment, and to \[132\] for a recent re- 
view of evaluation efforts in both speech communication 
and recognition systems. 
5 Opportunities 
for Advanced Military Appli- 
cations of Speech Technology 
5.1 In t roduct ion  and  Summary  
In this section, opportunities for advanced military ap- 
plications of speech technology are identified by means 
of descriptions ofseveral generic systems which would be 
possible with advances in speech technology and in sys- 
tem integration. These generic systems include: (1) inte- 
grated multi-rate voice/data communications terminal; 
(2) interactive speech enhancement system; (3) voice- 
controlled pilot's associate system; (4) advanced air traf- 
fic control training system; (5) battle management com- 
mand and control support system with spoken natural 
language interface; and (6) spoken language translation 
system. 
5.2 I n tegrated  Mu l t i -Rate  Vo ice /Data  
Communicat ions  Termina l  
Advanced speech processing will play a very important 
role in meeting the multiple and time-varying commu- 
439 
nications needs of military users. For example, a com- 
mander in a fixed or mobile command center will require 
communication over a variety of networks at a variety 
of conditions of stress on the networks. An integrated, 
multi-rate voice/data terminal \[39\] could be developed 
to support the commander's needs under normal and 
stressed conditions as follows: (1) under normal condi- 
tions, the terminal would provide secure digital voice, 
low-rate digital video, and graphics; (2) under heavily 
stressed conditions with network jamming and damage, 
the terminal would be limited to stylized data messages; 
(3) under more favorable but degraded network condi- 
tions, more interactive communications would be pro- 
vided, including very-low-rate secure voice using speech 
recognition and synthesis techniques. 
A sketch of the commander's terminal is shown in Fig- 
ure 1. The potential roles of advanced speech processing 
include: (1) a variable-rate coder capable of rates from 
50-9600 b/s, depending on network conditions (higher 
rates, with the attendant higher quality, would be used 
when conditions permit) and connectivity requirements; 
and (2) use of speech recognition as an alternate to the 
keyboard for control of the terminal modes and displays, 
and for selection or composition of data messages to be 
transmitted.

Variable-rate voice coding, including recogni- 
tion/synthesis, would also be useful in a scaled-down, 
very compact erminal for field operations \[129\] (e.g., by 
a forward observer in a tactical environment). A sketch 
indicating this application is shown in Figure 2. The re- 
quirements for voice processing are similar to those for 
the commander's terminal but with a greater emphasis 
on reduction of size, weight, and power. 
The current speech coding technologies discussed 
above will have to be extended, integrated, and im- 
plemented in compact hardware to provide integrated 
multi-rate terminals for future military communications 
Figure 2: Illustration of portable field terminal concept 
with variable-rate voice and data communications and 
data entry/retrieval 
needs. In the 200-800 b/s rate range, algorithm and im- 
plementation efforts are needed to provide speech coders 
with good performance. At lower bit rates, improve- 
ments to recognition techniques, as well as effective inte- 
gration of recognition into the communications environ- 
ment, are needed. As an example, Figure 3 illustrates a
concept for recognition-based speech communication i
a situation where the two-way link capacities are asym- 
metric. Here, the outgoing link from one user (e.g., a 
forward observer with a portable terminal, or an air- 
borne user) might only be able to support rates of 100 
b/s or below, while real-time voice (say, at 2400 b/s) is 
possible in the other direction. The possibility of con- 
firming the recognition/synthesis transmission by means 
of real-time voice transmission i the reverse direction of- 
fers the potential for effective voice communication with 
disadvantaged links. The development and test of an 
asymmetric voice coding system of this type could lead 
to an important military application of advanced speech 
processing technology. 
5.3 In teract ive  Speech  Enhancement  
Works ta t ion  
Advances in speech enhancement technology, coupled 
with the growing availability of high-performance graph- 
ics workstations and signal processing hardware, offer 
the opportunity for the development of an advanced, in- 
teractive speech enhancement workstation with multiple 
military applications. Such a system, as depicted in Fig- 
ure 4, would include: (1) real-time speech I/O, including 
the capability for simultaneous handling of inputs from 
multiple microphones or sensors \[17,37,116,147\]; (2) high 
capacity digital speech storage and playback facilities; 
(3) a user-selectable library of noise suppression, inter- 
ference suppression, speech transformation, and filtering

Figure 4: System structure and user interface for inter- 
active speech enhancement workstation 
A primary application for such a workstation would be 
as a listening and transcription aid for degraded speech. 
As described in \[89\], two general classes of transcrip- 
tion tasks can be identified: (1) transcription of large 
quantities of recorded material (such as public broad- 
casts, or the monitoring of critical telephone lines in a 
nuclear power station); and (2) transcription of single, 
important, and often very degraded recording (such as 
from a cockpit voice recorder after a crash, or forensic 
material obtained by a law enforcement agency). The 
interactive speech enhancement system could be used 
for either of these transcription tasks, as well as for en- 
hanced listening to real-time speech when transcription 
is not required. 
A great deal of speech enhancement algorithm tech- 
nology, which would be applicable in such a interactive 
workstation, has already been developed \[28,73,89,152, 
153\]; and integrating the available algorithms to oper- 
ate in real-time under flexible user control would be an 
important development effort. 
In addition, there is much to do in the further devel- 
opment of noise and interference r duction, particularly 
in situations where the interference includes co-channel 
speech (see, e.g., \[90,133,161\]). 
The advanced interactive speech enhancement work- 
station represents an important application of advancing 
speech technology. This work would build on ongoing 
technology and system efforts, most specifically on the 
pioneering and ongoing work sponsored by RADC on the 
speech enhancement unit \[28,152\], which has included 
both algorithm development and real-time system im- 
plementation using VLSI technology. 
5.4 Vo ice -Cont ro l led  P i lo t ' s  Assoc ia te  
Sys tem 
Pilots in combat face an overwhelming quantity of 
incoming data or communications on which they must 
base life or death decisions. In addition, they are faced 
with the need to control dozens of switches, buttons, 
and knobs to handle the multiple avionics functions in 
a modern military airplane cockpit. Especially for the 
case of a single-seater military aircraft, substantial bene- 
fit could be achieved through the development of a voice- 
controlled "pilot's associate", which reduces the pilot's 
workload, assisting the pilot in controlling avionics sys- 
tem and in keeping track of his changing environment. 
The concept of the pilot's associate was developed as 
part of the planning for the DARPA Strategic Comput- 
ing Program \[30\], as a paradigm for the development 
of intelligent "personal associate" systems which could 
have significant benefits in a variety of human-controlled, 
complex, military systems. 
The pilot's associate would ultimately consist of an en- 
semble of real-time natural interface system and expert 
knowledge-based systems. Figure 5 illustrates a concept 
for an evolving pilot's associate system, which would ini- 
tially provide a single set of control aids to the pilot, and 
would evolve to provide a growing set of more complex, 
knowledge-based functions. In its simplest form, the pi- 
lot's associate would include the capability for the pilot 
to control routine tasks by voice. The efforts described in 
earlier sections on speech recognition i  the cockpit will 
have to be extended to make speech recognition reliable 
and useful in the cockpit in order to support functions 
such as setting radio frequencies, etting navigation sys- 
tems, or selecting weapons ystems. 
In its advanced form, the pilot's associate would assist

the pilot in planning and anticipating functions which 
would otherwise be very difficult for the pilot, without 
having a second person on-board. Such functions might 
include: (1) early detection and diagnosis of an impend- 
ing malfunction; or (2) presentation of alternate action 
plans based on the current mission situation. The de- 
velopment of knowledge-based systems to support such 
tasks presents very difficult challenges, only one of which 
is an upgrade of the speech recognition interface to im- 
prove the naturalness and robustness ofpilot interaction 
with the system. 
The pilot's associate represents both an opportunity 
and a challenge for advanced computing technology in 
general and for speech technology in particular. The 
requirement for real-time operation under stressed con- 
ditions is particularly demanding for both knowledge- 
based information monitoring and planning systems, and 
for the speech interface to the pilot. 
5.5 Advanced A i r  T ra f f i c  Cont ro l  T ra in -  
ing  Sys tem 
Automated training systems can use computer speech 
recognition and generation to expedite training and to 
reduce the load on training personnel in a variety of ap- 
plications. Speech recognition and synthesis would be 
very helpful in hands-busy, eyes-busy training situations, 
for example in training personnel to maintain complex 
mechanical equipment. Here the individual could re- 
quest information from an "automated instruction man- 
ual" while continuing to carry on a manual task, and 
while maintaining his view of the equipment (e.g., a com- 
plex jet engine). However, as suggested in Section 4.8, 
voice-interactive systems are perhaps most attractive for 
training in tasks which require voice communication as
an integral part of the operational task, such as air traffic 
control (ATC). 
Previous efforts in the application of speech technol- 
ogy in ATC training systems have achieved only limited 
success \[20,48,93\], but advances in speech technology, 
simulation technology, expert systems for automated in- 
struction, and performance measurement offer signifi- 
cant potential for major advances in ATC training sys- 
tems. A generic voice-interactive ATC training system 
is shown in Figure 6. This particular block diagram 
was originally drawn to represent a Precision Approach 
Radar Training System \[20\], but similar structures would 
apply to other training scenarios uch as air intercept 
control.

The combination ofvoice-interactive technologies with 
simulation, environment modelling, and performance 
measurement has the potential to eliminate the need for 
a "pseudo-pilot" instructor to interact one-on-one with 
each student. Automated training has the further advan- 
tages of standardizing instruction and of capturing the 
expertise of the best instructors in the simulated training 
scenarios. In addition, as new automation capabilities in
ATC impose new tasks on the controller (e.g.,\[67\]), the 
automated training system could be updated to capture 
the knowledge of human experts in developing training 
scenarios which utilize voice-interactive pseudo-pilots. 
In the speech technology area, a number of advances 
will be needed to make an advanced ATC training system 
effective. Since the controllers are expected to speak in a 
constrained, stylized language, fully natural speech un- 
derstanding is not required. However, since controllers 
will stray from the constraints, it is essential that the 
recognition system be able to cope effectively with de- 
viations from the constrained vocabulary and grammar. 
At a minimum, recognition of the deviation and request 
to the trainee to rephrase his speech input would be 
needed. Even more desirable would be a system with 
adaptive training, which learns to extend its vocabu- 
442 
lary and grammar based on the trainee's peech to per- 
form correct recognition on an increasing percentage of
each trainee's utterances. Adaptive machine learning 
techniques also offer significant potential in the overall 
training system, for example in selecting and developing 
training scenarios which are well-matched tothe progress 
of each ATC trainee. 
In summary, the application of speech technology to 
ATC training is an area of high current interest \[18\] and 
significant future potential. In addition, speech recog- 
nition and synthesis may have important application 
in a large variety of intelligent raining systems \[70\], 
where the computer system effectively simulates a "tu- 
tor", communicating with the student in as natural a 
manner as possible.

Spoken Natura l  Language In ter face  
The application of natural spoken language interfaces 
in C 2 systems, including battle management, has been 
viewed for many years as a long-term goal of speech un- 
derstanding research including the DARPA speech un- 
derstanding program in the 1970's \[143\] and more recent 
efforts including the DARPA Strategic Computing Pro- 
gram \[8,30,33,38,65,96,150\]. Some current and previous 
efforts in this area were noted in an earlier section of 
this paper. Much remains to be done both in spoken 
language interface research and in the development of
associated support systems and knowledge-based expert 
systems to support C u users. 
Figure 7 shows a sketch of a system for C 2 battle man- 
agement with a spoken natural anguage interface. The 
generic system structure could be applied to a large va- 
riety of C 2 scenarios \[143\] including tactical, strategic, 
and logistics systems; considerable effort over the past 
few years has been devoted to the application of Naval 
battle management, under the Fleet Command and Con- 
trol Battle Management Program (FCCBMP) (see,e.g., 
\[8,34,65,96,150\]). There are numerous challenges to be 
addressed in developing a C 2 support system with a spo- 
ken natural anguage interface, which include: 
1. Techniques for query and management of a large 
database by spoken atural language must be devel- 
oped. For the case of FCCBMP, efforts in this area 
have included: development of the Naval resource 
management task domain \[108\], speech understand- 
ing work directed at this task domain \[31,32,33,34\], 
and porting of natural anguage interfaces to data 
base management task for the Naval data base \[8\]. 
2. Intelligent expert systems for planning and deci- 
sion support in the battle management task domain 
must be developed \[65\]. 
3. The spoken natural anguage interface must be ex- 
tended to interact with these complex expert sys- 
tems \[65,150\]. 
Figure 7: System sketch for C 2 battle management with 
a spoken natural anguage interface. The system in- 
cludes both relatively simple database retrieval and data 
entry functions, and more complex expert system aids 
for battle planning and management. For both classes of 
functions, the development of a natural spoken language 
interface represents a considerable challenge, requiring 
large-vocabulary, natural-grammar speech understand- 
ing 
4. The speech interface must be combined with other 
user-interface modalities including graphics, text, 
and pointing \[96\]. 
It is worth emphasizing that although C~ systems repre- 
sent an important opportunity for advanced speech pro- 
cessing in military systems, speech technology develop- 
ment is only one component ofthe challenge in advanced 
C 2 support systems. 
Meeting this challenge will require long-term future ef- 
forts in speech technology, natural language technology, 
intelligent system technology, and in system integration. 
Fortunately, it is not necessary to solve all the problems 
at once, and a phased approach ispossible. For example, 
initial efforts might involve speech interface to a C ~ data 
base management system only (not to the analysis and 
planning system); the user could initially be required to 
speak with a constrained vocabulary and grammar while 
research proceeds on understanding of spoken natural 
language. Useful aids to commanders and other system 
users could be provided with the data base management 
capability only, while work continues on the development 
and application of the intelligent system technology for 
the analysis and planning functions needed to provide 
additional decision aids to the C 2 user.

5.7 Spoken Language Trans la t ion  Sys-  
tem 
Automatic translation of spoken natural language cer- 
tainly represents one of the "grand challenges" \[79\] of 
speech and natural anguage technology, as well as a 
long-term opportunity for advanced speech technology. 
Applications of military relevance include: automatic n- 
terpreters for multi-language meetings, NATO field com- 
munications, a translating telephone, and translation for. 
cooperative space exploration activities. The impact of 
automated spoken language translation would clearly be 
enormous; however, the problem is considerably more 
difficult han either voice-operated natural language dic- 
tation machines or machine translation of text; both of 
which are unsolved problems requiring much future re- 
search. It should be noted, however, that progress con- 
tinues to be made in dictation systems \[7,61\]; and new 
initiatives in machine translation of text are being pro- 
posed and developed \[54\], including application of the 
powerful statistical techniques \[23\] which have been suc- 
cessful in speech recognition. 
algorithm toward toll quality speech across a variety of 
conditions. 
At lower rates (i.e., < 800 b/s), improvements in vec- 
tor quantization \[78\] and recognition-oriented chniques 
are needed to make systems effective for general use. 
6.3 Noise  and  In ter fe rence  Suppress ion  
The state-of-the-art in noise suppression is summarized 
in \[89\], which identifies a number of areas for further 
work in both algorithm development and in evaluation 
methods. In terms of recent approaches, a variety of 
combinations of recognition and noise suppression algo- 
rithms appear promising \[95,36,111\]. The suppression of
co-channel talker interference is an even more difficult 
problem than noise suppression \[161,90,133\], and much 
work is needed to achieve ffective suppression. Follow- 
ing the theme of integration of algorithm technologies, 
recent work has begun to apply speaker recognition tech- 
nology to the co-channel interference suppression prob- 
lem \[161,162\]. 
6 Prob lem Areas for Research 
6.1 In t roduct ion  and  Summary  
The Beek, Neuburg, IIodge paper of 1977 \[10\] concludes 
with an impressive list of unsolved problems, particu- 
larly in the area of automatic speech recognition. The 
current situation can (perhaps aptly) be summarized by 
adapting a popular phrase: "You've come a long way, 
baby, but you've still got a long way to go!". Despite all 
the progress, much research remains to be done before 
large-vocabulary continuous peech recognition crosses 
a threshold of performance sufficient for common use in 
applications. In other speech technology areas, some real 
military applications are either at hand or close, but still 
further esearch and development efforts are needed to 
achieve sufficient performance for many other applica- 
tions. 
This section briefly identifies a number of problem ar- 
eas for research, with a focus on directing attention to 
references where problems or progress are described in 
more detail. 
A theme sometimes observed in current work, which 
appears likely to produce significant progress and should 
be encouraged, is the integration of speech algorithm 
technologies. For example, speech recognition tech- 
niques are applied to speech coding to achieve lower bit 
rates; and speaker ecognition techniques may be inte- 
grated with speech coders or speech recognizers to im- 
prove robustness of performance across different speak- 
ers. 
6.2 Low-Rate  Speech  Cod ing  
Many of the problem areas in low-rate speech coding 
have already been summarized in earlier sections. At 
2.4 kb/s there is a need to move beyond the LPC-10 
6.4 Speech  Recogn i t ion  in Severe  Env i -  
ronments  
Prior sections have pointed out both the difficulties 
and the potential benefits of achieving robust, high- 
performance speech recognition in severe environments 
such as fighter aircraft or military helicopters. The Na- 
tional Research Council study \[38\] report summarizes 
both the state-of-the-art and research needed for auto- 
matic speech recognition in severe environments, as of 
1984. Substantial progress has been made since that 
time, particularly in system development and evaluation 
on databases of speech collected under stress and noise 
\[114\], application of HMM techniques to robust speech 
recognition \[92,100,101,149\], and in acoustic-phonetic 
analysis and compensation for effects of stress and noise 
\[64,130,131\]. A number of recent efforts have focussed 
specifically on compensating for acoustic noise in the 
tIMM recognizer \[57,58,144,145\]. However, this work 
has generally been performed for severe conditions which 
are simulated in the laboratory, and has achieved best 
performance for isolated-word recognition. Much work 
remains to achieve high-performance, ontinuous speech 
recognition under severe operational conditions; an es- 
sential, though costly, requirement for achieving progress 
in this area is a continuing program of data collection 
and speech recognizer testing in real (e.g., fighter or he- 
licopter) military environments. 
6.5 Large-Vocabu lary  Cont inuous  
Speech  Recogn i t ion  
There has been a great deal of effort and much progress 
in the area of large-vocabulary continuous peech in 
recent years \[5,31,32,33,34\]. But substantial improve- 
ments in performance are still needed before such sys- 
tems achieve high enough accuracy to be usable in prac- 
tical applications \[79\]. For example, a February 1989 
444 
evaluation \[97\] of a number of state-of-the-art systems 
on the 1000-word, perplexity-60 DARPA resource man- 
agement task yielded the following best results: 
1. speaker-dependent: word error rate 3.1%, sentence 
error rate 21.0%; 
2. speaker-independent: word error rate 6.1%, sen- 
tence error rate 34.3%. 
(Perplexity is a measure of the recognition task difficulty, 
and is defined as the probabilistically-weighted g ometric 
mean branching factor of the language (see, e.g., \[69\], pp. 
145-146)). For a 5000-word, perplexity-93 task, recent 
systems have achieved a speaker-dependent word error 
rate of 11.0% \[5\]. For an aggressive (but not unrealistic 
for applications requirements) goal, such as 95% speaker- 
independent sentence recognition for a 5,000-word vo- 
cabulary system, it is clear that an order-of-magnitude 
improvement in word error rate is needed. Some poten- 
tial sources of improvement, where research is needed, 
include \[79\] better signal representation, better mod- 
elling of linguistic units, and better parameter estima- 
tion. Recent efforts in phonetic lassification using neu- 
ral networks \[71\], and in combining neural network pat- 
tern classifiers with HMM techniques \[22,40,56,72,160\] 
offer potential promise in these areas. Additional sys- 
tem performance improvements should be achieved by 
improved language modelling, and by the integration of 
speech recognition and natural anguage processing sys- 
tems \[34\], as discussed further below. 
6.6 Natura l  Language Process ing  Tech-  
no logy  
Advanced systems involving interaction of people with 
computers using spoken language will clearly require 
substantial advances in natural anguage processing. A 
summary of the state-of-the-art, major challenges, and 
research opportunities in natural anguage processing is
presented in \[151\]. A major "grand challenge" cited 
for natural language processing is support for natural, 
interactive dialogue; this challenge, which must be ad- 
dressed even for textual natural anguage input, is clearly 
a pressing and more difficult challenge for spoken atural 
language input. 
6 .7 In tegrat ion  o f  Speech  Recogn i t ion  
and  Natura l  Language Process ing  
Systems 
The integration of speech recognition and natural an- 
guage processing systems to form interactive spoken lan- 
guage systems is a key focus for current \[34\] and future 
\[79,151\] research, needed to develop practical systems 
for complex military (and other) applications. Specific 
recent efforts which indicate promising directions for re- 
search and development in integration of speech recog- 
nition and natural anguage processing are described in 
\[86,102,124,163\]. 
6.8 Human Factors  
Work on human factors integration is an often ne- 
glected, but crucial, element which is necessary to re- 
alize the benefits of speech technology. Major areas of 
concern, which are summarized in \[38\], include task se- 
lection, dialogue design, user characteristics, speech dis- 
play design, task environment, and overall system per- 
formance assessment. Recent progress and research di- 
rections in the specific area of person/machine dialogues 
are covered rather broadly in \[141\]. 
An excellent controlled study in the use of voice di- 
alogs to accomplish specific tasks, which illustrates the 
effectiveness of voice as compared with other modalities 
(e.g., typing, writing), is described in \[25\]. Experiments 
indicating the capability of people to restrict hemselves 
to limited vocabularies in task-oriented dialogues are de- 
scribed in \[26\]. In general, more attention is needed to 
human factors and dialogue issues, and speech system 
developers can benefit significantly from the results of 
studies such as these, and from other studies cited in 
\[141\]. 
6.9 Speaker  Recogn i t ion  and  Ver i f i ca -  
t ion  
An excellent summary of the state-of-the-art and of ap- 
plications in speaker ecognition and verification, as of 
1985, is provided in \[35\]. Some promising recent efforts 
in the challenging problem of text-independent speaker 
recognition are described in \[45,117\]. An additional im- 
portant current (and projected future) research thrust 
\[79\] is the application of speaker ecognition techniques 
to adapt speech recognizers to speaker characteristics, 
and hence to improve speech recognition performance. 
7 Summary and Conclusions 
There has been much progress in recent years in speech 
technology and in application of this technology in mil- 
itary systems. This progress has brought some appli- 
cations of speech technology into operational use, has 
brought other applications into the development and test 
stage, and has brought closer the opportunities for ad- 
vanced applications. To realize the necessary technology 
for advanced applications, and to bring advanced ap- 
plications into practice, much work is needed in basic 
speech algorithm technology, speech system implemen- 
tation, and iterative test and improvement offielded sys- 
tems. 
This paper has presented in overview form: (1) a re- 
view and assessment of current military applications of 
speech technology; (2) an identification of a sampling 
of opportunities for future military applications of ad- 
vanced speech technology; and (3) an identification of 
problem areas for research to meet applications require- 
ments, and of promising research thrusts. 
Applications in narrowband speech communication 
and speech enhancement are seen to be at hand, and op- 
portunities as described for advanced voice/data work- 
445 
stations, based on extension and integration of current 
technology. In the speech recognition and spoken lan- 
guage understanding areas, a number of current ap- 
plications are described which are generally in the de- 
velopment and test stage. A number of opportunities 
for advanced applications in these areas are described; 
these generally will require significant advances in speech 
recognition technology, and in the integration of speech 
recognition i to systems which will require advanced nat- 
ural language processing and careful attention to system 
integration and human factors. Current efforts which are 
underway in speech recognition, natural anguage pro- 
cessing, and system development technology should lead, 
over the next several years, to significant technology ad- 
vances in speech technology, and to significant progress 
toward realizing these and other opportunities for mili- 
tary applications of advanced speech processing.
