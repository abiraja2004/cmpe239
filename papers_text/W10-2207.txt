Abstract 
 
This paper develops computational tools for 
evaluating competing syllabic parses of a pho-
nological string on the basis of temporal pat-
terns in speech production data. This is done 
by constructing models linking syllable parses 
to patterns of coordination between articulato-
ry events. Data simulated from different syl-
labic parses are evaluated against experimental 
data from American English and Moroccan 
Arabic, two languages claimed to parse similar 
strings of segments into different syllabic 
structures. Results implicate a tautosyllabic 
parse of initial consonant clusters in English 
and a heterosyllabic parse of initial clusters in 
Arabic, in accordance with theoretical work on 
the syllable structure of these languages. It is 
further demonstrated that the model can cor-
rectly diagnose syllable structure even when 
previously proposed phonetic heuristics for 
such structure do not clearly point to the cor-
rect diagnosis. 
1 Introduction 
Languages are claimed to differ in how word-
initial consonant clusters are parsed into higher 
level phonological structures. For example, Eng-
lish (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are 
claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syl-
lable onsets. In contrast, Berber and Moroccan 
Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters hete-
rosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable 
structure of these languages allows at most one 
consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset 
(Dell & Elmedlaoui, 2002). 
Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns 
of temporal stability in the production of initial 
clusters. In those cases where speech production 
data are available, languages that allow complex 
onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that 
differ from languages that allow only syllables 
with simplex syllable onsets.  
These observed temporal differences have 
been quantified in terms of the relative stability 
of intervals as calculated across words beginning 
with one, two and three initial consonants 
(Browman & Goldstein, 1988; Byrd, 1995; 
Honorof & Browman, 1995; Shaw, Gafos, 
Hoole, & Zeroual, 2009). Figure 1 schematizes 
temporal differences between simplex and com-
plex onsets. The figure shows three temporal in-
tervals left-delimited by landmarks in the conso-
nant cluster, the left edge of the cluster, the cen-
ter of the cluster and the right edge of the cluster, 
and right-delimited by a common anchor point. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Schematic representation of three in-
tervals, left edge to anchor, center to anchor and 
right edge to anchor, delineated by points in an 
initial single consonant or consonant cluster and 
a common anchor (A). The alignment schema on 
the left/right represents experimentally observed 
temporal manifestations of the simplex/complex 
onset parse. Such patterns have been used as 
phonetic heuristics in diagnosing syllable struc-
ture in experimental data. 
 
When clusters are parsed into simplex syllable 
onsets (Figure 1: left), the duration of the right 
edge to anchor interval is unperturbed by the ad-
dition of consonants to the word. Consequently, 
this interval remains stable across #CVX and 
54
#CCVX words. In contrast, when clusters are 
parsed into a complex onset (Figure 1: right), the 
duration of the right edge to anchor interval 
shrinks to make room for the addition of a con-
sonant to the syllable. Under this temporal 
alignment schema, the center to anchor interval 
remains more stable across #CVX and #CCVX 
words than both the right edge to anchor interval 
and the left edge to anchor interval.  
Experimental results showing temporal pat-
terns consistent with the schema on the right side 
of Figure 1 include Browman and Goldstein 
(1988), Honorof and Browman (1995), and Ma-
rin and Pouplier (2008) on American English, 
Goldstein, Chitoran, & Selkirk (2007) on Geor-
gian and Hermes, Grice, Muecke and Niemann  
(2008) on Italian. Results showing the temporal 
pattern on the left side of Figure 1 include 
Goldstein et al (2007) on Berber, Shaw et al 
(2009) on Moroccan Arabic and Hermes et al 
(2008) on Italian. 
We briefly review representative quantitative 
results illustrating the different temporal organi-
zations in Figure 1. For a language with complex 
onsets, Browman and Goldstein (1988) show that 
the standard deviation calculated across English 
word sets such as pot~sot~spot~lot~plot~splot is 
smaller for the center to anchor interval, 15.8 ms, 
than for the left edge to anchor interval, 37.7 ms, 
and the right edge to anchor interval, 33.6 ms. In 
contrast, for a simplex onset language, Shaw et 
al. (2009) show that across similar Moroccan 
Arabic word sets, e.g., bati~sbati, the right edge 
to anchor interval has a lower standard deviation, 
14 ms, than the center to anchor interval, 27 ms, 
and the left edge to anchor interval, 77 ms.  
Although the experimental work reviewed 
above shows that stability comparisons among 
the right edge to anchor, center to anchor and left 
edge to anchor intervals can provide good heuris-
tics for testing syllabification hypotheses in ex-
perimental data, such heuristics stated in terms of 
inequalities are known to break down under 
some conditions. For example, simulations with 
a model reported in Shaw et al (2009) demon-
strated that when the overall variability in the 
intervals is high, the simplex onset parse can 
generate intervals exhibiting stability reversals 
whereby the center to anchor interval is more 
stable than the right/left edge to anchor interval 
(contra the heuristic which states that the right 
edge to anchor interval should be the most stable; 
again, see Figure 1: left). This result indicates the 
frailty of phonetic heuristics in the form of in-
equalities, e.g. a simplex onset parse implies that 
the right edge to anchor interval is more stable 
than the center to anchor interval and the left 
edge to anchor interval. Such heuristics may be 
too coarse or even in some cases misleading in 
distinguishing competing syllabic parses using 
experimental data.  
This paper advances a quantitative method for 
evaluating competing syllable parses that aims to 
improve on previously proposed phonetic heuris-
tics and, by doing so, sharpen the interpretation 
of temporal stability patterns in terms of syllabic 
structure. In mediating between phonological 
theory and experimental data, the computational 
model makes it possible to discover syllabifica-
tion rules from phonetic patterns. The model 
provides a new understanding of languages with 
known syllable structure and the analytical tools 
to deduce syllabification rules in less-studied 
languages. 
2 Model 
The general plan is to simulate data from models 
encoding competing syllabic parses, to quantify 
in the simulated data the pattern of stability in 
the intervals shown in Figure 1, and to evaluate 
the goodness of fit between the pattern of stabili-
ty in the simulated data and the pattern of stabili-
ty in experimental data.  Our modeling paradigm 
capitalizes on structurally revealing temporal 
patterns in experimental data but improves on 
past work by modeling competing syllabic struc-
tures (both simplex and complex onset parses of 
initial clusters) and replacing hypotheses stated 
in the form of inequalities with quantitative in-
dices of goodness of fit between syllable parses 
and experimental data. 
Given a string of consonants and vowels, e.g. 
CCV, the models map the simplex and complex 
onset parse of that string to distinct coordination 
topologies. The coordination topologies reflect 
the temporal relations underlying the segmental 
sequence (Gafos, 2002: p. 316). Differences in 
temporal structure at this level yield the distinct 
temporal alignment patterns schematized in Fig-
ure 1. 
Figure 2 shows how the syllable parse, simp-
lex or complex, determines the relative temporal 
alignment of the segments involved. The boxes 
at the bottom of the figure (V rectangles) 
represent the temporal extent of the syllable nuc-
leus, the vowel, which depends on the syllable 
parse. On a simplex onset parse (Figure 2a) the 
vowel is aligned to the midpoint of the imme-
diately prevocalic consonant regardless of the 
55
number of preceding consonants. On a complex 
onset parse (Figure 2b) the vowel is aligned to 
the midpoint of the entire cluster of prevocalic 
consonants. These temporal alignment schemas 
have been proposed to underlie the experimental 
results we reviewed in Section 1. 
The model simulates the temporal organiza-
tion of words with one, two, and sometimes three 
initial consonant clusters on the basis of a proba-
bilistic interpretation of the temporal structure 
encoded in the syllable parse (simplex or com-
plex). In addition, the model has three phonetic 
parameters, kp, kipi, and V, which determine, re-
spectively, consonant plateau duration, the dura-
tion between consonant plateaus, and vowel du-
ration. These latter parameters can be set using 
estimates from the phonetic record. 
As summarized in Figure 2, word simulation 
proceeds from the immediately prevocalic con-
sonant, nC  . The timestamp of the release of 
this consonant, elRnC , is drawn from a Gaussian 
distribution. The timestamp of the achievement 
of target of this consonant, TarnC , is determined 
by subtracting consonant plateau duration, kp, 
from elRnC and adding an error term. Additional 
prevocalic consonants, e.g. C1 in #C1C2V, are 
determined with reference to the immediately 
preceding consonant. For example, the time-
stamp of the release of 1-nC ,
elR
nC 1- , is deter-
mined by subtracting the inter-plateau interval, 
kipi, from TarnC and adding a noise term. As noted 
above, the alignment of the vowel relative to the 
prevocalic consonant(s) is dictated by the sylla-
ble parse. 
Once the temporal structure of the input seg-
mental strings was generated, the stability of 
each target interval, the left edge to anchor, cen-
ter to anchor and right edge to anchor interval 
was calculated across words in the simulated da-
ta. For these intervals, the offset of the vowel 
was used as the anchor point.  
In light of past work indicating that phonetic 
heuristics for syllable structure may change as 
the level of variability in the data increases 
(Shaw et al, 2009), we also manipulated the va-
riability of the simulated intervals. We did this 
by varying the standard deviation of the vowel 
offset (from 0 to 70 ms in 15 discrete 5 ms in-
crements such that anchors 1, 2, 3?15 have a 
standard deviation of 0 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms?70 ms, 
respectively). Since the vowel offset serves as an 
anchor in right-delimiting all of the measured 
intervals, increasing the standard deviation of 
this point is one way to increase the level of va-
riability in all of the simulated intervals uniform-
ly. This effectively allows the level of variability 
in simulated data to match the level of variability 
in experimental data. 
 
 
Figure 2: Summary of word simulation in the 
model. Consonant landmarks are generated from 
the release of the immediately prevocalic conso-
nant. The alignment of the vowel is determined 
by the syllable parse (simplex or complex). 
 
To sum up the central idea, the task of evaluat-
ing syllable parses with experimental data has 
been formulated here as the task of fitting ab-
stract coordination topologies to the experimen-
tal data. This fitting can be expressed using two 
types of variables, coordination topologies and 
anchor variability. In the study of biological 
coordination and complex systems more general-
ly, these two variables correspond respectively to 
the so-called essential and non-essential va-
riables describing the behavior of complex sys-
tems (Kugler, Kelso, & Turvey, 1980: p. 13).  
Essential variables specify the qualitative form 
of the system under study. For us, this corres-
ponds to the syllabic parse of the phonological 
string. The fundamental hypothesis entailed in 
positing an abstract phonological organization 
isomorphic to syllable structure is that a syllable 
parse is a macroscopic organization uniform 
across a variegated set of segmental identities, 
lexical statistics and rate conditions, e.g. ?plea?, 
?tree?, ?glee? are single syllables independent of 
speech rate, frequency or phonotactic probability 
(see Catford 1977: p. 13 on ?phonological 
form?). 
All of the above factors, however, have left 
imprints on the articulatory patterns registered in 
the experimental data. Crucially, we do not know 
and it may not be possible to predict for any giv-
en stimulus how each such factor or combination 
56
of factors has affected the intervals quantified. 
Taken together, then, these and other yet un-
known factors have introduced noise in the inter-
vals that will be measured. Therefore, in formu-
lating the modeling problem of diagnosing sylla-
ble structure in experimental data, we let varia-
bility be one of the non-essential variables mani-
pulated in the fitting process. The anchor offers a 
convenient location for introducing this variabili-
ty into the intervals. In the discussion that fol-
lows, the non-essential variable of anchor index 
will be used to refer to the amount of variability 
introduced into the intervals through the anchor. 
3 Syllable parse evaluation 
Our models allow syllabic parses of the same 
string to be compared directly and evaluated 
quantitatively by determining which parse results 
in a better fit to the data. 
As an index of interval stability, we employ 
the relative standard deviation of the three inter-
vals shown in Figure 1, calculated across sets of 
words with one, two, and sometimes three initial 
consonants. Relative standard deviation, hence-
forth RSD, is calculated by dividing the standard 
deviation of an interval by its mean duration. 
Substantive reasons for using RSD as a depen-
dent variable and not the standard deviation or 
mean duration of the intervals are described, re-
spectively, in Shaw et al (2009: p. 203) and 
Shaw (2010: p. 111-112). 
Model performance was evaluated on the basis 
of two test statistics: the R2 statistic and the F 
statistic. The R2 statistic provides a measure of 
goodness of fit capable of detecting gradient im-
provement (or degradation) in model perfor-
mance as a function of parameter values. The F 
statistic, on the other hand, is used to evaluate 
model performance in the following way. Hits or 
misses for each pairing of simulated RSDs and 
data RSDs will be determined based upon p val-
ues generated from the F statistic. The criterion 
of p < .01 will be interpreted as successful rejec-
tion of the null hypothesis (that the RSD of all 
intervals is equal) and constitute a hit while fail-
ure to reject the null hypothesis constitutes a 
miss. This method of interpreting the F statistic 
provides a direct way to evaluate model perfor-
mance for each run of the simulation. Across 
multiple runs of the simulation, the ratio of hits 
to total runs (hits + misses) provides a hit rate 
which summarizes the performance of a syllable 
parse in matching the experimental data. 
This method of model evaluation has a con-
ceptual antecedent in other work in probabilistic 
grammar. The hit rate as described above plays a 
similar role in model evaluation as the confi-
dence scores employed in Albright and Hayes 
(2003). The probabilistic rules of English past 
tense formation developed in that paper are asso-
ciated with a reliability index. Albright and 
Hayes (2003) refer to this as a raw confidence 
score. The raw confidence score of a rule is the 
likelihood that the rule applies when its envi-
ronment is met. The score is the ratio of the 
number of times that a particular rule applies, 
hits, by the number of times in which the envi-
ronment for the rule is present in the data, the 
rule?s scope. For example, the rule for the Eng-
lish past tense [?] ? [?]/ {l,r}___? correctly de-
rives forms such as sprung from spring and flung 
from fling, but makes the wrong prediction, 
brung and not brought, for bring. Of the 4253 
verbs employed in the Albright and Hayes 
(2003) learning set, the environment of the 
spring-sprung rule occurs 9 times and the rule 
applies correctly in 6 of those cases yielding a 
raw confidence score of .667. In contrast, the 
most general rule for the English past tense ? ? 
d / X ____ has a scope identical to the size of the 
data set, 4253, and applies in 4034 cases yielding 
a raw confidence score of .949. In the case at 
hand, that of syllable structure, the hit rate pro-
posed above plays a similar role to that of the 
confidence score. It provides a simple statistic 
summarizing the fit of a syllable parse to data. 
The value of the non-essential variable (anc-
hor index) that maximizes the R2 statistic is also 
informative in evaluating syllable structure. 
When the syllable parse is correct, then large 
amounts of noise added to the intervals may be 
harmful, pushing the model output away from 
patterns dictated by the essential variable. On the 
other hand, when the syllable parse is wrong, 
then increases in noise may improve model per-
formance by pushing the intervals in the direc-
tion of the correct syllable parse on some trials. 
Since noise is inserted into the intervals through 
the anchor, comparing the anchor indices that 
maximize R2 may be informative in evaluating 
syllable parses. A lower anchor index indicates a 
better-fitting syllable parse. 
The F and R2 statistics used to provide quan-
titative evaluation of syllabic structure as de-
scribed above are obtained by plotting RSDs 
measured in the data (x-axis) against correspond-
ing RSDs simulated by the model (y-axis), and 
57
fitting a regression line to these coordinates us-
ing the least squares method. A representative 
plot is shown in Figure 3. The x-axis shows the 
RSD of the three intervals of interest for the bul-
ha~sbulha~ksbulha triad as reported in Shaw et 
al. (2009). These are plotted against RSDs simu-
lated by the model given a simplex onset parse 
and different levels of anchor variability. For 
simplicity in presentation, just four of the fifteen 
anchors simulated are shown in the figure. The 
standard deviation of these representative anc-
hors is as follows: anchor 1 = 0 ms, anchor 7 = 
30 ms, anchor 11 = 50 ms, and anchor 14 = 65 
ms.  
Figure 3 shows that R2 is highest when the 
simplex onset parse is paired with anchor 7. At 
this level of anchor variability, the simplex onset 
parse provides a perfect fit to the data. At both 
lower (anchor 1) and higher (anchor 11) levels of 
anchor variability, the fit to the data is degraded. 
 
 
Figure 3. Fit between model and data. The RSD 
of three intervals in the data (x-axis) are plotted 
against the RSD of simulated intervals (y-axis) at 
different levels of anchor variability (anchor 1, 
anchor 7, anchor 11, anchor 14). 
 
As illustrated in Figure 3, model performance 
is assessed by calculating the regression line on 
the basis of all three measured intervals at once. 
In doing so, the regression line captures the rela-
tionship between different measured intervals, or 
the pattern of interval stability. Since it is not the 
absolute value of the RSD of an interval but ra-
ther the relations between the RSDs of different 
intervals that is of theoretical interest, this is an 
important aspect of the fitting procedure.  
For simulations reported below, the phonetic 
parameters discussed around Figure 2 are based 
on typical values for the languages under consid-
eration. For American English, the values of 
these parameters used in the simulations were: kp 
= 45 ms; kipi = 0 ms, and V = 230 ms. The error 
term, e, associated with each consonantal land-
mark has a standard deviation of 14 ms. For Mo-
roccan Arabic, the parameter values were:  kp = 
42 ms; kipi = 66 ms, V = 196 ms. The error term 
was set to 20 ms. The results below are based on 
1000 runs of the simulation for each word set. 
4 Results 
The simpex and complex onset parses were eva-
luated against three corpora using the procedure 
described above. The first two corpora are re-
ported in Browman and Goldstein (1988) and 
Shaw et al (2009) and provide relevant data on 
American English and Moroccan Arabic, respec-
tively. Each of these studies reports articulatory 
data on just one speaker. The third corpus is a 
subset of the Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam 
Speech Production Database (Westbury, 1994). 
The sample analyzed here contains data from 
thirty-three speakers of American English. 
4.1 American English (single speaker) 
Our first American English data set draws from 
work of Browman and Goldstein (1988) which 
provides measurements of the stability of three 
relevant temporal intervals, left edge to anchor, 
right edge to anchor, and center to anchor, calcu-
lated over the following word set: [p?t], [s?t], 
[l?t], [sp?t], [spl?t], [pl?t]. Interval stability was 
reported in terms of the standard deviation of 
each interval calculated across the word set. 
In order to make these results directly compa-
rable to those for Moroccan Arabic to be dis-
cussed in the next section, the relative standard 
deviation (RSD) of the English productions was 
calculated by dividing the standard deviation of 
each interval by the mean of that interval. Al-
though Browman and Goldstein (1988) do not 
report the mean duration of the intervals, they 
provide a figure for each word and a scale (1 cm 
= 135 ms) for the figures allowing the relevant 
intervals to be measured. For each word, the du-
ration of the three intervals of interest was meas-
ured from the figure and the standard deviation 
of the intervals was calculated across words. The 
resulting RSD values are shown in Table 1.  
The RSDs from the data were compared to 
values output from model simulations based on a 
simplex onset parse, e.g., [sp.l?t]~[p.l?t]~[l?t], 
and a complex onset parse, e.g., 
[spl?t]~[pl?t]~[l?t], of the target strings. One run 
of the simulation generates ten repetitions of 
58
each of three word types, i.e., words beginning 
with one, two and three initial consonants. These 
words are generated based on a value for the es-
sential variable (syllable structure) and a range of 
values of the non-essential variable (anchor in-
dex).

by one speaker of American English. 
 
The hit rate for the complex onset parse was 
95.5% compared to just 57.7% for the simplex 
onset parse. This indicates that the complex onset 
parse provides a better fit to this data than the 
simplex onset parse. Moreover, the anchor index 
that maximizes R2 for the complex onset parse is 
lower (anchor 3) than for the simplex parse (anc-
hor 12). This further indicates that the complex 
onset parse outperforms the simplex onset parse 
on this data.  
4.2 Moroccan Arabic (single speaker) 
The results above indicate that the complex onset 
parse provides a better fit to the English data 
than the simplex onset parse. This section eva-
luates Moroccan Arabic data against these same 
syllabic parses. The data come from Shaw et al 
(2009) which reports the RSD of the intervals of 
interest for seven word sets containing dyads or 
triads differing only in the number of initial con-
sonants, e.g. bulha~sbulha~ksbulha. The word 
sets and the reported RSD of the intervals are 
summarized in Table 2. 
For each word set, the model simulated cor-
responding word types. That is, for triads, e.g., 
bulha~sbulha~ksbulha, the model simulated 10 
repetitions of words beginning with one, two, 
and three initial consonants, and, for dyads, e.g. 
tab~ktab, 10 repetitions of words beginning with 
one and two consonants. The model simulated 
word sets under each of the competing syllabic 
parses and evaluated the fit of each syllabic parse 
to the experimental data. 
The resulting hit rates are summarized in Ta-
ble 3. For each of the target word sets, the simp-
lex onset parse shows a clear advantage in fitting 
the data. Hit rates for the simplex parse are above 
75.4% in all cases and the hit rate for the com-
plex onset parse never rises above 00.0%. More-
over, the anchor indices that maximize R2 for the 
simplex onset parse are low, ranging from anchor 
1 to anchor 7. For the complex onset parse, the 
highest variability anchor (anchor 15) provides 
the best fit to the data in all cases.

sets. The anchor index that maximized R2 for 
each syllable parse is given in parenthesis. 
 
In sum, the simplex onset parse outperforms 
the complex onset parse on Moroccan Arabic 
data. The opposite result was obtained for Amer-
ican English. For English, it was the complex 
onset parse that achieved a higher hit rate with a 
lower anchor index.  
59
Each of the data sets evaluated thus far were 
contributed by a single speaker. In these data the 
patterns of interval stability clearly reveal tem-
poral organization in terms of syllables. To eva-
luate whether the model continues to distinguish 
syllabic parses when phonetic heuristics break 
down, we now turn to a corpus of less controlled 
stimuli from multiple speakers with a high de-
gree of inter-speaker variability. 
4.3 American English (multi-speaker data) 
Under some conditions, stability-based phonetic 
heuristics break down as reliable indicators of 
syllable structure. This is known to occur, for 
example, when the level of overall variability in 
the intervals is high (Shaw et al, 2009).  
In controlled experimental studies, as can be 
seen in Figure 1, neither of the two syllabic 
parses, simplex or complex, has been observed to 
show the left edge to anchor interval as more 
stable than the center to anchor and right edge to 
anchor intervals. At high levels of variability, 
however, the probabilistic model developed in 
our work can produce patterns whereby the left 
edge to anchor interval is more stable than the 
other two intervals. This occurs regardless of the 
syllable parse when the anchor index is high (e.g. 
15), which represents a high degree of variability 
in the intervals (the reason why high interval va-
riability results in this pattern is explained in 
Shaw et al 2009). Under these conditions of 
high variability, both values of the essential vari-
able (simplex and complex onset parses) gener-
ate a pattern whereby the left edge to anchor in-
terval has a lower RSD than the center to anchor 
interval and the right edge to anchor interval. 
Thus, at this level of variability, stability-based 
phonetic heuristics, i.e., center to anchor stability 
implies a complex onset parse, are rendered inef-
fective in distinguishing syllabic parses. 
When variability leads competing syllable 
parses to the same predictions in terms of inequa-
lities (both models show left edge to anchor sta-
bility), is our modeling paradigm still capable of 
distinguishing syllabic parses? To address this 
question, we need a corpus with the requisite 
level of variability.  
The Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Pro-
duction Database provides  recordings of a varie-
ty of tasks including production of sentences, 
passages and word lists from fifty-seven speakers 
of American English (Westbury, 1994). Al-
though not all speakers completed all tasks and 
some tokens have missing data which make them 
unusable for this analysis, it remains an archive 
of articulatory data that is extremely impressive 
in size. Within this archive there are various 
near-minimal pairs that can be used to evaluate 
syllable structure using the methods employed 
above. Here we report on thirty-three speakers? 
productions of the dyad row~grows. Calculating 
interval stability across multiple speaker samples 
of this word dyad is one way to introduce varia-
bility into the intervals and, by doing so, provide 
an interesting test case for our proposed methods.  
The target word row was produced in the sen-
tence Things in a row provide a sense of order. 
This sentence is one of several unrelated sen-
tences included in Task #60 within the X-ray 
microbeam corpus. The word grows was pro-
duced in the sentence That noise problem grows 
more annoying each day, which is included in 
Task #56. Although these target words were pro-
duced in different syntactic frames and occur in 
different phrasal positions, we assume, following 
standard phonological assumptions, that all in-
stances of /gr/ and /r/ were syllabified identically, 
namely, that they are parsed into complex sylla-
ble onsets. To test this assumption, we ask 
whether the models converge on the same result. 
In all respects except for the determination of 
the anchor point, the quantification of the X-ray 
microbeam data followed the same procedure 
described for Electromagnetic Articulometry da-
ta in Shaw et al (2009). To determine the anchor 
point, we followed past work on English (Brow-
man and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman 
1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset 
of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point right-
delimiting the intervals of interest. This was done 
for the following reason. The target words in this 
case are not matched at the right edge of the syl-
lable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel) 
and this makes it difficult to determine a com-
mon articulatory anchor across words. The arti-
culatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals 
of interest were the same as for the English and 
Arabic data discussed above.  
The duration of the three intervals, left edge to 
anchor, center to anchor and right edge to anc-
hor, were measured for one repetition of each 
word, row and grows, for thirty-three speakers. 
The variation across speakers in the duration of 
these intervals was substantial. As an example, 
the left edge to anchor interval of row ranges 
from 193 ms (Subject 44) to 518 ms (Subject 
53). The mean, standard deviation and relative 
standard deviation of the intervals calculated 
across row and grows are provided in Table 4.

 In this data the RSD of the left edge to anchor 
interval is lower than the RSD of both the center 
to anchor and right edge to anchor intervals. 
From the perspective of phonetic heuristics of 
syllable structure, this fact by itself is not par-
ticularly revealing. Both syllabic parses predict-
this should be the case at very high levels of va-
riability. This data set therefore provides a chal-
lenge to phonetic heuristics stated in the form of 
directional inequalities and an appropriate test of 
the quantitative methods developed here.

Simulations with the simplex and complex on-
set models generated RSD values that were fitted 
to the RSD values of the three intervals of inter-
est in the English row~grows data. On each run, 
the model simulated 10 repetitions of words be-
ginning with one and two consonants. The same 
values of the constants used for the other English 
simulations were employed here as well, and the 
same range of anchor variability was produced 
for each parse. Anchor 1 has a standard deviation 
of zero and the standard deviation of each subse-
quent anchor increases by 5 ms so that anchor 15 
has a standard deviation of 70 ms. Table 5 re-
ports the results of 1000 runs of the simulation.

The results of the model fitting reveal that the 
complex onset parse provides a superior fit to the 
data. The complex onset parse achieves a higher 
hit rate (99.0% vs. 91.8%) with a less variable 
anchor (anchor 6 vs. anchor 11) than the simplex 
onset parse. This result demonstrates that the 
model can distinguish syllabic parses even in 
noisy data contributed by multiple speakers. 
Since the target words, row and grows, were 
produced in different environments, there are 
potentially a number of interacting factors in-
fluencing the pattern of temporal stability in the 
data. A model incorporating, for example, pro-
sodic structure above the level of the syllable 
may identify interactions between syllable and 
higher levels of prosodic structure. We plan to 
explore models of this sort in future work. It re-
mains an important result of the current model 
that competing parses of a given string can be 
distinguished in the data even at levels of varia-
bility that obscure phonetic heuristics for syllable 
structure. 
5 Conclusion 
There is a growing body of evidence indicating 
that the temporal dimension provides a rich 
source of information revealing phonological 
structure. In the domain syllables, the relation 
between temporal patterns in experimental data 
and qualitative aspects of phonological structure 
has often taken the form of statements expressing 
inequalities, e.g., a complex onset parse implies 
that the center to anchor interval is more stable 
than the right/left edge to anchor intervals. Pho-
netic heuristics of this sort are valid only under 
certain conditions. The models developed in this 
paper generate finer-grained quantitative predic-
tions of syllabic structure based on a probabilis-
tic interpretation of temporal organization. Our 
models make predictions not just about stability 
inequalities but also about the permissible degree 
to which interval stabilities may differ from one 
another under a given syllable parse. Crucially, 
these predictions allow for evaluation of compet-
ing syllable parses even when statements in the 
form of inequalities do not.  
As the phonological literature is replete with 
debates regarding the syllabification of conso-
nant clusters, the tools developed here have im-
mediate application. They allow rigorous evalua-
tion of syllable structure on the basis of experi-
mental data.
