Abstract 
In the paper, we describe methods for 
exploitation of a new lexical database of 
valency frames (VerbaLex) in relation to 
Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL). We 
present a detailed description of the 
Complex Valency Frames (CVF) as they 
appear in VerbaLex including basic 
ontology of the VerbaLex semantic roles. 
TIL is a typed logical system developed for 
natural language semantic representation 
using TIL logical forms known as 
constructions. TIL is well suited to handle 
the difficult language phenomena such as 
temporal relations, intensionality and 
propositional attitudes. Here we make use 
of the long-term development of the 
Normal Translation Algorithm aimed at 
automatic translation of natural language 
sentences into TIL constructions. 
We examine the relations between CVFs 
and TIL constructions of predicate-
argument structures and discuss the 
procedure of automatic acquisition of the 
verbal object constructions. The 
exploitation of CVFs in the syntactic 
parsing is also briefly mentioned. 
1 Introduction 
In the paper we propose a method to integrate the 
logical analysis of sentences with the linguistic 
approach to semantics, exploiting the complex 
valency frames (CVFs) in the VerbaLex verb 
valency lexicon, see (Hlav??kov?, Hor?k, Kadlec 
2006). To this end we first present a brief survey of 
the logic we are going to use, namely Transparent 
Intensional Logic (TIL), which was originated by 
P. Tich? (Tich? 1988). Theoretical aspects of TIL 
were further developed in particular by P. Materna 
(Materna 1998) and also by co-authors of this 
paper (see, Materna, Du?? 2005, Hor?k 2002). A 
question may be asked why we do not exploit first 
order predicate logic (PL1) where some of the 
presented problems have already been explored 
and PL1 has been used to represent logical forms. 
It is a well established fact that PL1 is not able to 
handle systematically the phenomena like 
propositional verbs (which, of course, appear in 
our valency frames), grammatical tenses and 
modalities (modal verbs and modal particles in 
natural language). On the other hand, since TIL 
works with types these problems either do not arise 
or they can be solved in an intuitive way (see Ti-
ch? 1988). 
In the second linguistic section we present CVFs 
by means of which the semantics of verbs in 
natural language such as Czech or English can be 
described.  
In Section 3 we show how CVFs describe the 
surface valencies of verbs (i.e. their respective 
morphological cases in Czech) as well as the 
semantics of their predicate-argument structure. 
Concerning the latter we make use of the deep 
semantic roles expressed by two-level labels based 
partly on the Top Ontology (EuroWordNet) and 
partly on the selected literals from Princeton 
WordNet. 
Since so far these two ways of description, namely 
the logical and linguistic one, have been treated 
separately, the task we set is to propose a method 
97
of their interrelation and coordination. Needless to 
say that both ways of description of verb semantics 
are useful.  
Hence we are going to show how to combine a 
logical description using mostly terms like types, 
individuals, classes, relations, propositions, or, in 
general, constructions of these entities, with the  
linguistic framework capturing the idiosyncratic 
semantic features of the verbs such as 
SUBS(liquid:1) or AG(person:1|animal:1).  
In Section 4 we adduce an example of the analysis 
of selected English and Czech verbs for which the 
above mentioned integration has been proposed.  
   
2 Basics of Transparent Intensional 
Logic 
In this Section we provide an introductory 
explanation of the main notions of Transparent 
Intensional Logic (TIL). For exact definitions and 
details see, e.g., Tich? (1988), Tich? (2004), 
Materna (1998), Materna (2004) and Materna, 
Du?? (2005). TIL  approach to knowledge 
representation can be characterised as the ?top-
down approach?. TIL ?generalises to the hardest 
case? and obtains the ?less hard cases? by lifting 
various restrictions that apply only higher up. This 
way of proceeding is opposite to how semantic 
theories tend to be built up. The standard approach 
(e.g. predicate logic) consists in beginning with 
atomic sentences, then proceeding to molecular 
sentences formed by means of truth-functional 
connectives or by quantifiers, and from there to 
sentences containing modal operators and, finally, 
attitudinal operators. 
Thus, to use a simple case for illustration, once a 
vocabulary and rules of formation have been laid 
down, semantics gets off the ground by analysing 
an atomic sentence as follows: 
 (1) ?Charles is happy?: Fa 
And further upwards: 
 (2) ?Charles is happy, and Thelma is 
grumpy?: Fa ? Gb 
 (3) ?Somebody is happy?: ?x (Fx) 
 (4) ?Possibly, Charles is happy?:  (Fa) 
 (5) ?Thelma believes that Charles is happy?: 
Bb (Fa). 
In non-hyperintensional (i.e., non-procedural) 
theories of formal semantics, attitudinal operators 
are swallowed by the modal ones. But when they 
are not, we have three levels of granularity: the 
coarse level of truth-values, the fine-grained level 
of truth-conditions (propositions, truth-values-in-
intension), and the very fine-grained level of 
hyper-propositions, i.e., constructions of 
propositions. TIL operates with these three levels 
of granularity. We start out by analysing sentences 
from the uppermost end, furnishing them with a 
hyperintensional1 semantics, and working our way 
downwards, furnishing even the lowest-end 
sentences (and other empirical expressions) with a 
hyperintensional semantics. That is, the sense of a 
sentence such as ?Charles is happy? is a hyper-
proposition, namely the construction of the 
denoted proposition (i.e., the instruction how to 
evaluate the truth-conditions of the sentence in any 
state of affairs). 
When assigning a construction to an expression as 
its meaning, we specify a procedural know-how, 
which must not be confused with the respective 
performancy know-how. Distinguishing 
performatory know-how from procedural know-
how, the latter could be characterised ?that a 
knower x knows how A is done in the sense that x 
can spell out instructions for doing A.? For 
instance, to know what Goldbach Conjecture 
means is to understand the instruction to find 
whether ?all positive even integers ? 4 can be 
expressed as the sum of two primes?. It does not 
include either actually finding out (whether it is 
true or not by following a procedure or by luck) or 
possessing the skill to do so.2  
Furthermore, the sentence ?Charles is happy? is an 
?intensional context?, in the sense that its logical 
analysis must involve reference to empirical 
parameters, in this case both possible worlds and 
instants of time. Charles is only contingently 
happy; i.e., he is only happy at some worlds and 
only sometimes. The other reason is because the 
analysans must be capable of figuring as an 
argument for functions whose domain are 
propositions rather than truth-values. Construing 
?Fa? as a name of a truth-value works only in the 
case of (1), (2) and (3). It won?t work in (5), since 
truth-values are not the sort of thing that can be 
                                                           
1  The term ?hyperintensional? has been introduced by 
Max Cresswell in Cresswell (1975). See also 
Cresswell (1985).

Jespersen, M?ller (2005). 
98
believed. Nor will it work in (4), since truth-values 
are not the sort of thing that can be possible. 
Constructions are procedures, or instructions, 
specifying how to arrive at less-structured entities. 
Being procedures, constructions are structured 
from the algorithmic point of view, unlike set-
theoretical objects. The TIL ?language of 
constructions? is a modified hyper-intensional 
version of the typed ?-calculus, where Montague-
like ?-terms denote, not the functions constructed, 
but the constructions themselves. Constructions 
qua procedures operate on input objects (of any 
type, even on constructions of any order) and yield 
as output (or, in well defined cases fail to yield) 
objects of any type; in this way constructions 
construct partial functions, and functions, rather 
than relations, are basic objects of our ontology.  
By claiming that constructions are algorithmically 
structured, we mean the following: a construction 
C ? being an instruction ? consists of particular 
steps, i.e., sub-instructions (or, constituents) that 
have to be executed in order to execute C. The 
concrete/abstract objects an instruction operates on 
are not its constituents, they are just mentioned. 
Hence objects have to be supplied by another 
(albeit trivial) construction. The constructions 
themselves may also be only mentioned: therefore 
one should not conflate using constructions as 
constituents of composed constructions and 
mentioning constructions that enter as input into 
composed constructions, so we have to strictly 
distinguish between using and mentioning 
constructions. Just briefly: Mentioning is, in 
principle, achieved by using atomic constructions. 
A construction is atomic if it is a procedure that 
does not contain any other construction as a used 
subconstruction (a constituent). There are two 
atomic constructions that supply objects (of any 
type) on which complex constructions operate: 
variables and trivializations.  
Variables are constructions that construct an object 
dependently on valuation: they v-construct, where 
v is the parameter of valuations. When X is an 
object (including constructions) of any type, the 
Trivialization of X, denoted 0X, constructs X 
without the mediation of any other construction. 0X 
is the atomic concept of X: it is the primitive, non-
perspectival mode of presentation of X. 
There are three compound constructions, which 
consist of other constructions: Composition, 
Closure and Double Execution. Composition [X Y1 
? Ym] is the procedure of applying a function f v-
constructed by X to an argument A v-constructed 
by Y1,?,Ym, i.e., the instruction to apply f to A to 
obtain the value (if any) of f at A. Closure 
[?x1?xm Y] is the procedure of constructing a 
function by abstracting over variables, i.e., the 
instruction to do so. Finally, higher-order 
construction X can be used twice over as a 
constituent of a composed construction. This is 
achieved by the fifth construction called Double 
Execution 2X.  
TIL constructions, as well as the entities they 
construct, all receive a type. On the ground level of 
the type-hierarchy, there are entities unstructured 
from the algorithmic point of view belonging to a 
type of order 1. Given a so-called epistemic (or 
?objectual?) base of atomic types  (?-truth values, 
?-individuals, ?-time moments / real numbers, ?-
possible worlds), mereological complexity is 
increased by the induction rule for forming partial 
functions: where ?, ?1,?,?n are types of order 1, 
the set of partial mappings from ?1 ??? ?n to ?, 
denoted (??1??n), is a type of order 1 as well. 
Constructions that construct entities of order 1 are 
constructions of order 1. They belong to a type of 
order 2, denoted by *1. Inductively we define type 
of order n, *n.  
TIL is specific in a precise solution for intensions 
as non-empirical objects of the real world. 
Intensions are qualified as functions of a type 
((??)?), i.e., functions from possible worlds to 
chronologies of the type ? (in symbols: ???), 
where a chronology is a function of type (??). 
Some important kinds of intensions are:  
Propositions, type ??? (shortened as ?). They are 
denoted by empirical (declarative) sentences. 
Properties of members of a type ?, or simply ?-
properties, type (??)??.3 General terms (some 
substantives, intransitive verbs) denote properties, 
mostly of individuals. 
Relations-in-intension, type (??1??m)??. For 
example transitive empirical verbs, also attitudinal 
verbs denote these relations. Omitting ?? we get the 
type (??1??m) of relations-in-extension (to be met 
mainly in mathematics). 
                                                           
3  Collections, sets, classes of ??-objects? are members 
of type (??); TIL handles classes (subsets of a type) 
as characteristic functions. Similarly relations (-in-
extension) are of type(s) (??1??m). 
99
?-roles or offices, type ???, where ? ? (??). 
Frequently ??? (an individual office). Often denoted 
by concatenation of a superlative and a noun (?the 
highest mountain?). Individual roles correspond to 
what Church calls an ?individual concept?. 
 
3 The Complex Valency Frames 
Valency frames have been built in several projects 
(VALLEX for Czech PDT (?abokrtsk? 2005) or 
VerbNet (Kipper et al2006)). Motivation for the 
VerbaLex project came from comparing Czech 
WordNet verb frames with VALLEX. The main 
goal of VerbaLex is an automatic processing of 
verb phrases exploiting explicit links to Princeton 
WordNet. The complex valency frames we are 
working with can be characterized as data 
structures (tree graphs) describing predicate-
argument structure of a verb which contains the 
verb itself and the arguments determined by the 
verb meaning (their number usually varies from 1-
5). The argument structure also displays the 
semantic preferences on the arguments. On the 
syntactic (surface) level the arguments are most 
frequently expressed as noun or pronominal groups 
in one of the seven cases (in Czech) and also as 
prepositional cases or adverbials.  
An example of a complex valency frame for the 
verb zab?t (kill) looks like: 
usmrtit:1/zab?t:1/dostat:11 (kill:1) 
-frame: AG<person:1|animal:1>who_nomobl   
 VERBobl   
 PAT<person:1|animal:1>whom_accobl   
 INS<instrument:1>with_what_insopt    
-example: vrah zabil svou ob?? no?em (A murderer 
has killed the victim with a knife). 
-synonym: 
-use: prim 
More examples of CVFs for some selected verbs 
can be found below in Section 4. 
The semantics of the arguments is typically labeled 
as belonging to a given semantic role (or deep 
case), which represents a general role plus 
subcategorization features (or selectional 
restrictions). Thus valency frames in Verbalex 
include information about:  
1. the syntactic (surface) information about 
the syntactic valencies of a verb, i.e. what 
morphological cases (direct and 
prepositional ones in highly inflected 
languages such as Czech) are associated 
with (required by) a particular verb, and 
also adverbials, 
2. semantic roles (deep cases) that represent 
the integration of the general labels with 
subcategorization features (or selectional 
restrictions) required by the meaning of the 
verb.   
The inventory of the semantic roles is partly 
inspired by the Top Ontology and Base Concepts 
as they have been defined within EuroWordNet 
project. Thus we work with the general or ?large? 
roles like AG, ART(IFACT), SUBS(TANCE), 
PART, CAUSE, OBJ(ECT) (natural object), 
INFO(RMATION), FOOD, GARMENT, 
VEHICLE and others. They are combined with the 
literals from Princeton WordNet 2.0 where literals 
represent subcategorization features allowing us to 
climb down the hypero/hyponymical trees to the 
individual lexical units. For example, we have 
AG(person:1|animal:1) or SUBS(liquid:1) that can 
be used within the individual CVFs. 
The verb entries are linked to the Czech and 
Princeton WordNet 2.0, i.e. they are organized 
around the respective lemma in synsets with 
numbered senses.  
The Czech lexical resource being now developed is 
then a list of Czech CVFs ? this work is going on 
within the Verbalex project at FI MU (Hlav??kov?, 
Hor?k, 2005). Verbalex now contains approx. 
11000 verb literals organized in synsets. The 
current goal is to enlarge the lexicon to 15 000 
verbs. 
The inventory of the semantic roles we work with 
clearly represents a sort of ontology which tries to 
cover word stock of Czech verbs and can be used 
as a base for a semantic classification and 
subclassification of the verbs. The ontologies 
represent theoretical constructs designed from the 
?top? and as such they are not directly based on the 
empirical evidence, i.e. corpus data. Thus there is a 
need to confront the ontologies and the inventories 
of the semantic roles that can be derived from them 
with the corpus data and see how well they can 
correspond to them. For this purpose we are 
experimenting with the corpus data obtained from 
the Word Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff, Rychl?,  
Smr?, Tugwell 2006).

4 Logical Analysis Using CVFs 
In this section we describe the translation of 
VerbaLex CVFs into a verb phrase, which is a core 
of a sentence logical analysis.  
TIL comes with a dissociation of significant verbs 
into two groups according to the classification of 
their meaning: 
1. by attributive verbs we ascribe qualities or 
properties to objects. Attributive verbs are 
typically expressed by the respective form 
of the verb ?to be? combined with an 
expression denoting a property; examples: 
?to be red? or ?to be mellow? or with a 
general substantive like ?to be a traitor?, ?to 
be a tree?. 
2. episodic verbs, on the other hand, specify 
actions performed by a subject. 
An episodic verb does not describe its subject's 
state in any moment of time, it rather describes an 
episode of doing something at the certain time 
moment (and necessarily some time before that 
moment plus the expectation that it will last also in 
the next few moments, at least). TIL provides a 
complex handling of episodic verbs including the 
verb tense, aspect (perfective/imperfective) or 
active/passive state. All these features are 
concentrated around the so called verbal object, the 
construction of which (i.e., the meaning of a 
particular verb phrase) is the application of (the 
construction of) the verb to (the constructions of) 
the verb's arguments. 
Since the analysis of attributive verbs is usually 
quite simple, we will concentrate in the following 
text on the examples of selected episodic verbs 
from VerbaLex and their logical analysis using the 
complex valency frames. 
The TIL type of episodic verbal objects is 
(?(??)(??))?, where ? is the type of propositions 
(???). See (Hor?k 2002, pp. 64-73) and (Tich? 
1980) for detailed explanation. Our analysis is 
driven by a linguistic (syntactic) context that 
signals the semantic fact that there is always a 
function involved here, so that we have to ascribe 
types to its arguments and value. 
 
4.1 Examples of Logical Analysis 
We have chosen cca 10 verbs with their verb 
frames from VerbaLex and we will use them as 
examples of the algorithm for determining the verb 
type in the TIL logical analysis procedure. 
 
d?t (give) 
d?t:2 / d?vat:2 / darovat:1 / v?novat:1 (give:8, 
gift:2, present:7) 
-frame: DON<organization:1>what_nomobl VERBobl  
OBJ<object:1>what_accobl  
BEN<person:1>to_whom_datobl 
-example: firma v?novala zam?stnanc?m nov? auta 
(a company gave new cars to the employees) 
-use: prim 
The verb arguments in this frame are: who, to 
whom, what (all obligatory) with (at least) two 
options: a) to whom  is an individual, b) to whom is 
a class of individuals. The respective verb types 
are ad a): ((?(??)(??))????),  
ad b): ((?(??)(??))??(??)?).  
For example to whom = to the employees of a 
given institution. To be an employee of the 
institution XY is a property, say Z / (??)??. So ?The 
company gave to the employees of XY??, not 
taking into account grammatical tenses and 
omitting trivializations we get ?w?t [Givewt XY 
Zwt etc.] (XY has the type ? here, being a collective 
rather than a class.) 
With this example, we can show that CVFs are 
used not only for determining the verbal object 
type, but also for stating additional prerequisities 
(necessary conditions) for the sentence 
constituents. The full analysis using the verb frame 
above thus contains, except the verb phrase part, 
the conditions saying that ?X gives Y to Z ? 
organization(X)  ? object(Y) ? person(Z)?. The 
predicates organization, object and person here 
represent the properties denoted by the 
corresponding terms in the wordnet hypero-
hyponymical hierarchy. 
 
d?t:15 / d?vat:15 / nab?dnout:3 / nab?zet:3 
(give:37) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl VERBobl   
ABS<abstraction:1>what_accobl
 REC<person:1>to_whom_datobl 
-example: dal j? sv? slovo (he gave her his word) 
-example: nab?dl j? sv? srdce (he offered her his 
heart) 
-use: fig 
 
Here we have an idiom (?to give word?), which 
corresponds to an (episodic) relation between two 
101
individuals. Thus the type of the verb is 
((?(??)(??))???), the second ? corresponds to to 
whom. 
 
 
br?nit (prevent) 
br?nit:1 / zabr?nit:2 / zabra?ovat:2 / zamezit:2 / 
zamezovat:2 (prevent:2, keep:4) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl  VERBobl 
PAT<person:1>to_whom_datobl   ACT<act:1>infobl  
-example: zabr?nila mu uhodit syna (she prevented 
him from hitting the son) 
-use: prim 
 
br?nit:1 / zabr?nit:2 / zabra?ovat:2 / zamezit:2 / 
zamezovat:2 (prevent:2, keep:4) 
-frame: AG<institution:1>what_nomobl VERBobl   
PAT<person:1>to_whom_datobl
 ACT<act:2>in_what_locopt 
-example: policie mu zabr?nila v cest? do zahrani?? 
(police prevented him from going abroad) 
-use: prim 
 
Here, arguments of the verb correspond to the 
phrases who, to whom, in (from). The third 
argument has the type of an activity given, of 
course, by an episodic verb hit the son, travel 
abroad (the substantive form travelling abroad can 
be construed as that activity). The type of the verb 
is ((?(??)(??))???((?(??)(??))?)). 
 
??ct (say) 
??ct:1 / ??kat:1 / ??ci:1 / ??kat:1 / pravit:1 (say:6) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl   VERBobl   
COM<speech act:1>what_acc,that,dspobl   
ADR<person:1>to_whom_datopt 
-example: ??ct kolegovi dobr? den (say hello to a 
colleague) 
-example: ?ekl, ?e to plat? (he said that it holds) 
-example: pravil: "Dobr? den" (he said: ?Good 
day?) 
-use: prim 
 
The case questions for the corresponding 
arguments of the verb ??ct are a) who, what1, 
b) who, what2, c) who, to whom, what1, and d) who, 
to whom, what2. Examples of instantiated 
sentences can be a) Charles says ?Hello?, 
b) Charles says that he is ill, c) Charles says to his 
colleague ?Hello?, or d) Charles says to his 
colleague that he is ill.  
The quotation context (ad a), c)) is normally 
impossible to type. Unless we want to go into some 
deep analyses we can ascribe to any quoted 
expression the type of individual. The relation to 
and unquoted subordinate clause is analysed as a 
general construction of type ?n.  The resulting 
types of verbs are then  
a) ((?(??)(??))???),  
b) ((?(??)(??))???n),  
c) ((?(??)(??))????),  
d) ((?(??)(??))????n). 
 
bre?et1 (cry) because of something, for 
something 
bre?et:1 / plakat:1 (cry:2, weep:1) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl   VERBobl   
CAUSE<cause:4>due+to+what_dat,over+what_ins,for+what_accobl    
-example: bre?ela kv?li zni?en?m ?at?m (she cried 
for spoiled clothes) 
-example: plakal nad svou chudobou (he cried over 
his poverty) 
-example: plakal pro sv? h??chy (he cried for his 
sins) 
-use: prim 
 
bre?et2 (cry) for somebody 
bre?et:1 / plakat:1 (cry:2, weep:1) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl VERBobl  
ENT<person:1>for+whom_accobl  
-example: plakala pro mil?ho (she cried for her 
boy) 
-use: prim 
 
If I cry because of, for etc., then the role of causing 
is played by this because of. Crying is an episodic 
verb, whereas because of etc. is a relation between 
propositions, often between events. We have 
therefore because of / (???)??, where the first 
?(=???) belongs to the proposition denoted, e.g., by 
clothes have been spoiled or that the respective 
individual is poor, sinful etc., and the second ? to 
the proposition that the respective individual cries.  
In case of to cry for somebody the respective type 
is again a ?relation? ((?(??)(??))???), although this 
for hides some cause, which is, however, not 
mentioned.  
With this verb, we will describe the analysis of 
verb entailment handling in TIL. If we analyse a 
general case of the above mentioned meanings of 
cry (cry1-because of something, cry2-for 
102
somebody) simply to cry, (He cries all the time). 
This verb?s type is a verbal object without 
arguments, (?(??)(??))?. In addition to this the 
following rule holds: If X cries because of? or X 
cries for?, then X cries. In this way the semantic 
dependence between the three cases of crying is 
given; otherwise we would not be able to detect 
this connection, e.g. between bre?et1 and bre?et2. 
 
absolvovat (undergo) 
absolvovat:2 / pro??t:1 / pro??vat:1 (experience:1, 
undergo:2, see:21, go through:1) 
-frame: AG<person:1>who_nomobl VERBobl  
EVEN<experience:3>what_accobl  
LOC<location:1>in_what_locopt  
-example: absolvoval vy?et?en? na psychiatrick? 
klinice (he went through investigation in a 
psychiatric clinic) 
-use: prim 
In general it is an episodic relation to an event 
(type ?)4, so the type is ((?(??)(??))???). In some 
cases we may also use a relation to an episode 
(specific class of events, type (??)), then the type 
is ((?(??)(??))??(??)), and investigation in a clinic 
has to be defined as a sequence of events. 
 
akceptovat (accept)

We can accept nearly anything. Here we meet the 
problem of type-theoretical polymorphism, which 
is handled here as a type scheme ((?(??)(??))???), 
for an arbitrary type ?. A quintessence of such a 
polymorphism: think on (about) ? one can think 
of an object of any kind.

If understood as in ?What does (s)he live off? (S)he 
teaches.? it is the case of cry3 (see above). To 
teach understood as in ?He teaches history, 
maths?, etc., the analysis depends on which type is 
given to the school subjects, disciplines. One 
possibility is to analyse them as properties of a set 
of propositions, (?(??))??. Then to teach receives 
the type ((?(??)(??))??(?(??))??). If ?teaches 
alphabet? is the case then we have to decide what 
we mean by alphabet. Here the point is to teach 
(learn) to associate symbols and sounds 
(phonemes?), so the respective type of alphabet is 
(??), where ? is the type of symbols, ? the type of 
sounds. In the analysis of ?to educate somebody in 
something? the verb takes an individual as its 
additional argument: ((?(??)(??))????), where ? is 
the type of the discipline. 
In all the examples, we have displayed the 
relations between the two-level semantic roles used 
in the VerbaLex verb frames and the resulting 
logical analysis types of the verbal object as the 
main part of the clause?s logical construction. The 
algorithmisation of this procedure uses a list of all 
roles used in the lexicon (there are about 200 roles 
used) with the corresponding (ambiguous) logical 
types of the constituents. In this way we can form a 
basic skeleton of the automatic translation of text 
to logical constructions. 
5 Conclusions 
The paper presented a first outline of comparison 
and integration of the two approaches, namely 
logical and linguistic, to the semantics of verbs in a 
natural language (English and Czech). We are 
aware that this work is still in a great progress and 
the results so presented rather fragmentary. Still, 
we are convinced that the research project we aim 
at is a relevant contribution to the semantics of 
natural language.

We have shown that pursuing such a research is 
reasonable and comes up with a new viewpoint to 
the meaning of verbs. In this way we extend our 
knowledge in the important way. Actually, we are 
dealing with two deep levels of the meaning 
description and a question may be asked which one 
is deeper and better. Our answer is, do not contrast 
the two levels, and make use of both of them. In 
this way we believe to integrate them into one 
compact whole and perhaps obtain a unique data 
structure. The results of the presented research can 
be immediately applied in the area of knowledge 
representation and in the long-term Normal 
Translation System project that is being prepared. 
We have not tackled the other deep descriptions, 
such as the method that exploits the 
tectogramatical level as it is presently applied in 
PDT (Haji? 2004). This, obviously, is a topic of 
another paper.
