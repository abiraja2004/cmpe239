Abstract 
This paper presents a new statistical method 
for detecting and tracking changes in word 
meaning, based on Latent Semantic Analysis. 
By comparing the density of semantic vector 
clusters this method allows researchers to 
make statistical inferences on questions such 
as whether the meaning of a word changed 
across time or if a phonetic cluster is asso-
ciated with a specific meaning. Possible appli-
cations of this method are then illustrated in 
tracing the semantic change of ?dog?, ?do?, and 
?deer? in early English and examining and 
comparing phonaesthemes. 
1 Introduction 
The increase in available computing power over 
the last few decades has led to an explosion in 
the application of statistical methods to the anal-
ysis of texts. Researchers have applied these me-
thods to a wide range of tasks, from word-sense 
disambiguation (Levin et al, 2006) to the sum-
marization of texts (Marcu, 2003) and the auto-
matic scoring of student essays (Riedel et al, 
2006). However, some fields of linguistics that 
have traditionally employed corpora as their 
source material, such as historical semantics, 
have yet to benefit from the application of these 
statistical methods.  
In this paper we demonstrate how an existing 
statistical tool (Latent Semantic Analysis) can be 
adapted and used to automate and enhance some 
aspects of research in historical semantics and 
other fields whose focus is on the comparative 
analysis of word meanings within a corpus. Our 
method allows us to assess the semantic variation 
within the set of individual occurrences of a giv-
en word type. This variation is inversely related 
to a property of types that we call density ? intui-
tively, a tendency to occur in highly similar con-
texts. In terms of our LSA-based spatial semantic 
model, we calculate vectors representing the con-
text of each occurrence of a given term, and es-
timate the term?s cohesiveness as the density 
with which these token context vectors are 
?packed? in space. 
2 The method 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a collective 
term for a family of related methods, all of which 
involve building numerical representations of 
words based on occurrence patterns in a training 
corpus. The basic underlying assumption is that 
co-occurrence within the same contexts can be 
used as a stand-in measure of semantic related-
ness (see Firth, 1957; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; 
Hoey, 1991, for early articulations of this idea). 
The success of the method in technical applica-
tions such as information retrieval and its popu-
larity as a research tool in psychology, education, 
linguistics and other disciplines suggest that this 
hypothesis holds up well for the purposes of 
those applications. 
The relevant notion of ?context? varies. The 
first and still widely used implementation of the 
idea, developed in Information Retrieval and 
originally known as Latent Semantic Indexing 
(Deerwester et al, 1990), assembles a term-
document matrix in which each vocabulary item 
(term) is associated with an n-dimensional vector 
recording its distribution over the n documents in 
the corpus. In contrast, the version we applied in 
this work measures co-occurrence in a way that 
is more independent of the characteristics of the 
documents in the training corpus, building in-
104
stead a term-term matrix associating vocabulary 
items with vectors representing their frequency 
of co-occurrence with each of a list of ?content-
bearing? words. This approach originated with 
the ?WordSpace? paradigm developed by 
Sch?tze (1996). The software we used is a ver-
sion of the ?Infomap? package developed at 
Stanford University and freely available (see also 
Takayama et al, 1999). We describe it and the 
steps we took in our experiments in some detail 
below. 
2.1 Word vectors 
The information encoded in the co-occurrence 
matrix, and thus ultimately the similarity meas-
ure depends greatly on the genre and subject 
matter of the training corpus (Takayama et al, 
1999; Kaufmann, 2000). In our case, we used the 
entire available corpus as our training corpus. 
The word types in the training corpus are ranked 
by frequency of occurrence, and the Infomap 
system automatically selects (i) a vocabulary ?  
for which vector representations are to be col-
lected, and (ii) a set ? of 1,000 ?content-bearing? 
words whose occurrence or non-occurrence is 
taken to be indicative of the subject matter of a 
given passage of text. Usually, these choices are 
guided by a stoplist of (mostly closed-class) lexi-
cal items that are to be excluded, but because we 
were interested in tracing changes in the meaning 
of lexical items we reduced this stoplist to a bare 
minimum. To compensate, we increased the 
number of ?content-bearing? words to 2,000. The 
vocabulary ? consisted of the 40,000 most fre-
quent non-stoplist words. The set ? of content-
bearing words contained the 50th through 2,049th 
most frequent non-stoplist words. This method 
may seem rather blunt, but it has the advantage 
of not requiring any human intervention or ante-
cedently given information about the domain. 
The cells in the resulting matrix of 40,000 
rows and 2,000 columns were filled with co-
occurrence counts recording, for each 
pair  ?, ? ? ? ? ?, the number of times a token 
of ? occurred in the context of a token of ? in 
the corpus.1 The ?context? of a token ??  in our 
                                                 
1 Two details are glossed over here: First, the Infomap sys-
tem weighs this raw count with a ??. ??? measure of the 
column label c, calculated as follows: ??. ??? ? = ?? ? ?
 ??? ? + 1 ? ??? ?? ?    where ?? and ?? are the number 
of occurrences of ? and the number of documents in which 
? occurs, respectively, and ? is the total number of docu-
ments. Second, the number in each cell is replaced with its 
square root, in order to approximate a normal distribution of 
counts and attenuate the potentially distorting influence of 
implementation is the set of tokens in a fixed-
width window from the 15th item preceding ??  
to the 15th item following it (less if a document 
boundary intervenes). The matrix was trans-
formed by Singular Value Decomposition 
(SVD), whose implementation in the Infomap 
system relies on the SVDPACKC package 
(Berry, 1992; Berry et al, 1993). The output was 
a reduced 40,000 ? 100 matrix. Thus each item 
? ? ? is associated with a 100-dimensional 
vector ?   . 
2.2 Context vectors 
Once the vector space is obtained from the 
training corpus, vectors can be calculated for any 
multi-word unit of text (e.g. paragraphs, queries, 
or documents), regardless of whether it occurs in 
the original training corpus or not, as the normal-
ized sum of the vectors associated with the words 
it contains. In this way, for each occurrence of a 
target word type under investigation, we calcu-
lated a context vector from the 15 words preced-
ing and the 15 words following that occurrence. 
Context vectors were first used in Word Sense 
Discrimination by Sch?tze (1998). Similarly to 
that application, we assume that these ?second-
order? vectors encode the aggregate meaning, or 
topic, of the segment they represent, and thus, 
following the reasoning behind LSA, are 
indicative of the meaning with which it is being 
used on that particular occurrence. Consequently, 
for each target word of interest, the context 
vectors associated with its occurrences constitute 
the data points. The analysis is then a matter of 
grouping these data points according to some 
criterion (e.g., the period in which the text was 
written) and conducting an appropriate statistical 
test. In some cases it might also be possible to 
use regression or apply a clustering analysis. 
2.3 Semantic Density Analysis 
Conducting statistical tests comparing groups of 
vectors is not trivial. Fortunately, some questions 
can be answered based on the similarity of vec-
tors within each group rather than the vectors 
themselves. The similarity between two vectors 
?   , ?  is measured as the cosine between them:2 
                                                                          
high base frequencies (cf. Takayama, et al 1998; Widdows, 
2004). 
2 While the cosine measure is the accepted measure of simi-
larity, the cosine function is non-linear and therefore prob-
lematic for many statistical methods. Several transforma-
tions can be used to correct this (e.g., Fisher?s z). In this 
paper we will use the angle, in degrees, between the two 
vectors (i.e., ????1) because it is easily interpretable. 
105
??? ?   , ?  =
?   ? ? 
 ?     ?  
 
 
The average similarity of a group of vectors is 
indicative of its density ? a dense group of highly 
similar vectors will have a high average cosine 
(and a correspondingly low average angle) 
whereas a sparse group of dissimilar vectors will 
have an average cosine that approaches zero (and 
a correspondingly high average angle).3 Thus 
since a word that has a single, highly restricted 
meaning (e.g. ?palindrome?) is likely to occur in 
a very restricted set of contexts, its context vec-
tors are also likely to have a low average angle 
between them, compared to a word that is highly 
polysemous or appears in a large variety of con-
texts (e.g. ?bank?, ?do?). From this observation, it 
follows that it should be possible to compare the 
cohesiveness of groups of vectors in terms of the 
average pairwise similarity of the vectors of 
which they are comprised. Because the number 
of such pairings tends to be prohibitively large 
(e.g., nearly 1,000,000 for a group of 1,000 vec-
tors), it is useful to use only a sub-sample in any 
single analysis. A Monte-Carlo analysis in which 
n pair-wise similarity values are chosen at ran-
dom from each group of vectors is therefore ap-
propriate.4 
However, there is one final complication to 
consider in the analysis. The passage of time in-
fluences not only the meaning of words, but also 
styles and variety of writing. For example, texts 
in the 11th century were much less varied, on av-
erage, than those written in the 15th century.5 
This will influence the calculation of context 
vectors as those depend, in part, on the text they 
are taken from. Because the document as a whole 
is represented by a vector that is the average of 
all of its words, it is possible to predict that, if no 
other factors exist, two contexts are likely to be 
related to one another to the same degree that 
their documents are. Controlling for this effect 
can therefore be achieved by subtracting from 
                                                 
3
 Since the cosine ranges from -1 to +1, it is possible in 
principle to obtain negative average cosines. In practice, 
however, the overwhelming majority of vocabulary items 
have a non-negative cosine with any given target word, 
hence the average cosine usually does not fall below zero. 
4
 It is important to note that the number of independent 
samples in the analysis is determined not by the number of 
similarity values compared but by the number of individual 
vectors used in the analysis. 
5 Tracking changes in the distribution of the document 
vectors in a corpus over time might itself be of interest to 
some researchers but is beyond the scope of the current 
paper. 
the angle between two context vectors the angle 
between the documents in which they appear.  
3 Applications to Research 
3.1 A Diachronic Investigation: Semantic 
Change 
One of the central questions of historical seman-
tics is the following (Traugott, 1999):6 
 
Given the form-meaning pair ? (lexeme) what 
changes did meaning ? undergo? 
 
For example, the form as long as underwent 
the change `equal in length? > `equal in time? > 
`provided that?. Evidence for semantic change 
comes from written records, cognates, and struc-
tural analysis (Bloomfield, 1933).  Traditional 
categories of semantic change include (Traugott, 
2005: 2-4; Campbell, 2004:254-262; Forston, 
2003: 648-650): 
? Broadening (generalization, extension, 
borrowing): A restricted meaning becomes less 
restricted (e.g. Late Old English docga `a (spe-
cific) powerful breed of dog? > dog `any member 
of the species Canis familiaris? 
? Narrowing (specialization, restriction): A 
relatively general meaning becomes more specif-
ic (e.g. Old English deor `animal? > deer) 
? Pejoration (degeneration): A meaning be-
comes more negative (e.g. Old English s?lig 
`blessed, blissful? > sely `happy, innocent, pitia-
ble? > silly `foolish, stupid?) 
 
Semantic change results from the use of lan-
guage in context, whether linguistic or extralin-
guistic. Later meanings of forms are connected to 
earlier ones, where all semantic change arises by 
polysemy, i.e. new meanings coexist with earlier 
ones, typically in restricted contexts. Sometimes 
new meanings split off from earlier ones and are 
no longer considered variants by language users 
(e.g. mistress `woman in a position of authority, 
head of household? > `woman in a continuing 
extra-marital relationship with a man?). 
Semantic change is often considered unsyste-
matic (Hock and Joseph, 1996: 252). However, 
recent work (Traugott and Dasher, 2002) sug-
gests that there is, in fact, significant cross-
linguistic regularity in semantic change. For ex-
                                                 
6 This is the semasiological perspective on semantic change. 
Other perspectives include the onomasiological perspective 
(?Given the concept ?, what lexemes can it be expressed 
by??). See Traugott 1999 for discussion. 
106
ample, in the Invited Inferencing Model of Se-
mantic Change proposed by Traugott and Dasher 
(2002) the main mechanism of semantic change 
is argued to be the semanticization of conversa-
tional implicatures, where conversational impli-
catures are a component of speaker meaning that 
arises from the interaction between what the 
speaker says and rational principles of communi-
cation (Grice, 1989 [1975]). Conversational im-
plicatures are suggested by an utterance but not 
entailed. For example, the utterance Some stu-
dents came to the party strongly suggests that 
some but not all students came to the party, even 
though the utterance would be true strictly speak-
ing if all students came to the party. According to 
the Invited Inferencing Model, conversational 
implicatures become part of the semantic poly-
semies of particular forms over time. 
Such changes in meaning should be evident 
when examining the contexts in which the lex-
eme of interest appears. In other words, changes 
in the meaning of a type should translate to dif-
ferences in the contexts in which its tokens are 
used. For instance, semantic broadening results 
in a meaning that is less restricted and as a result 
can be used in a larger variety of contexts. In a 
semantic space that encompasses the period of 
such a change, this increase in variety can be 
measured as a decrease in vector density across 
the time span of the corpus. This decrease trans-
lates into an increase in the average angle be-
tween the context vectors for the word. For in-
stance, because the Old English word ?docga? 
applied to a specific breed of dog, we predicted 
that earlier occurrences of the lexemes ?docga? 
and ?dog?, in a corpus of documents of the ap-
propriate time period, will show less variety than 
later occurrences. 
An even more extreme case of semantic broa-
dening is predicted to occur as part of the process 
of grammaticalization (Traugot and Dasher, 
2002) in which a content word becomes a func-
tion word. Because, as a general rule, a function 
word can be used in a much larger variety of 
contexts than a content word, a word that under-
went grammaticalization should appear in a sub-
stantially larger variety of contexts than it did 
prior to becoming a function word. One well stu-
died case of grammaticalization is that of periph-
rastic ?do?. While in Old English ?do? was used 
as a verb with a causative and habitual sense 
(e.g. ?do you harm?), later in English it took on a 
functional role that is nearly devoid of meaning 
(e.g. ?do you know him??). Because this change 
occurred in Middle English, we predicted that 
earlier occurrences of ?do? will show less variety 
than later ones. 
In contrast with broadening, semantic narrow-
ing results in a meaning that is more restricted, 
and is therefore applicable in fewer contexts than 
before. This decrease in variety results in an in-
crease in vector density and can be directly 
measured as a decrease in the average angle be-
tween the context vectors for the word. As an 
example, the Old English word ?deor? denoted a 
larger group of living creatures than does the 
Modern English word ?deer?. We therefore pre-
dicted that earlier occurrences of the lexemes 
?deor? and ?deer?, in a corpus of the appropriate 
time period, will show more variety than later 
occurrences. 
We tested our predictions using a corpus de-
rived from the Helsinki corpus (Rissanen, 1994). 
The Helsinki corpus is comprised of texts span-
ning the periods of Old English (prior to 
1150A.D.), Middle English (1150-1500A.D.), 
and Early Modern English (1500-1710A.D.). 
Because spelling in Old English was highly vari-
able, we decided to exclude that part of the cor-
pus and focused our analysis on the Middle Eng-
lish and Early Modern English periods. The re-
sulting corpus included 504 distinct documents 
totaling approximately 1.1 million words. 
To test our predictions regarding semantic 
change in the words ?dog?, ?do?, and ?deer?, we 
collected all of the contexts in which they appear 
in our subset of the Helsinki corpus. This re-
sulted in 112 contexts for ?dog?, 4298 contexts 
for ?do?, and 61 contexts for ?deer?. Because 
there were relatively few occurrences of ?dog?

and ?deer? in the corpus it was practical to com-
pute the angles between all possible pairs of con-
text vectors. As a result, we elected to forgo the 
Monte-Carlo analysis for those two words in fa-
vor of a full analysis. The results of our analysis 
for all three words are given in Table 1. These 
results were congruent with our prediction: The 
density of the contexts decreases over time for 
both ?dog? (t(110) = 2.17, p < .05) and ?do? 
(F(2,2997)=409.41, p < .01) while in the case of 
?deer? there is an increase in the density of the 
contexts over time (t(36) = 3.05, p < .01). 
Furthermore, our analysis corresponds with 
the data collected by Elleg?rd (1953). Elleg?rd 
traced the grammaticalization of ?do? by manual-
ly examining changes in the proportions of its 
various uses between 1400 and 1700. His data 
identifies an overall shift in the pattern of use 
that occurred mainly between 1475 and 1575. 
Our analysis identifies a similar shift in patterns 
between the time periods spanning 1350-1500 
and 1500-1570. Figure 1 depicts an overlay of 
both datasets. The relative scale of the two sets 
was set so that the proportions of ?do? uses at 
1400 and 1700 (the beginning and end of El-
leg?rd?s data, respectively) match the semantic 
density measured by our method at those times. 
Finally, our method can be used not only to 
test predictions based on established cases of 
semantic change, but also to identify new ones. 
For instance, in examining the contexts of the 
word ?science? we can identify that it underwent 
semantic broadening shortly after it first ap-
peared in the 14th century (t(77) = 4.51, p < .01). 
A subsequent examination of the contexts in 
which the word appears indicated that this is 
probably the result of a shift from a meaning re-
lated to generalized knowledge (e.g., ??and 
learn science of school?, John of Trevisa's Polyc-
hronicon, 1387) to one that can also be used to 
refer to more specific disciplines (e.g., ??of the 
seven liberal sciences?, Simon Forman?s Diary, 
1602). 
Our long term goal with respect to this type of 
analysis is to use this method in a computer-
based tool that can scan a diachronic corpus and 
automatically identify probable cases of semantic 
change within it. Researchers can then use these 
results to focus on identifying the specifics of 
such changes, as well as examine the overall pat-
terns of change that exist in the corpus. It is our 
belief that such a use will enable a more rigorous 
testing and refinement of existing theories of se-
mantic change. 
3.2 A Synchronic Investigation: Phonaes-
themes 
In addition to examining changes in meaning 
across time, it is also possible to employ our me-
thod to examine how the semantic space relates 
to other possible partitioning of the lexemes 
represented by it. For instance, while the rela-
tionship between the phonetic representation and 
semantic content is largely considered to be arbi-
trary, there are some notable exceptions. One 
interesting case is that of phonaesthemes (Firth, 
1930), sub-morphemic units that have a predict-
able effect on the meaning of the word as a 
whole. In English, one of the more frequently 
mentioned phonaesthemes is a word-initial gl- 
which is common in words related to the visual 
modality (e.g., ?glance?, ?gleam?). While there 
have been some scholastic explorations of these 
non-morphological relationships between sound 
and meaning, they have not been thoroughly ex-
plored by behavioral and computational research 
(with some notable exceptions; e.g. Hutchins, 
1998; Bergen, 2004). Recently, Otis and Sagi 
(2008) used the semantic density of the cluster of 
words sharing a phonaestheme as a measure of

the strength of the relationship between the pho-
netic cluster and its proposed meaning.  
Otis and Sagi used a corpus derived from 
Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/) 
as the basis for their analysis. Specifically, they 
used the bulk of the English language literary 
works available through the project?s website. 
This resulted in a corpus of 4034 separate docu-
ments consisting of over 290 million words.  
The bulk of the candidate phonaesthemes they 
tested were taken from the list used by Hutchins 
(1998), with the addition of two candidate pho-
naesthemes (kn- and -ign). Two letter combina-
tions that were considered unlikely to be pho-
naesthemes (br- and z-) were also included in 
order to test the method?s capacity for discrimi-
nating between phonaesthemes and non-
phonaesthemes. Overall Otis and Sagi (2008) 
examined 47 possible phonaesthemes. 
In cases where a phonetic cluster represents a 
phonaestheme, it intuitively follows that pairs of 
words sharing that phonetic cluster are more 
likely to share some aspect of their meaning than 
pairs of words chosen at random. Otis and Sagi 
tested whether this was true for any specific can-
didate phonaestheme using a Monte-Carlo analy-
sis. First they identified all of the words in the 
corpus sharing a conjectured phonaestheme7 and 
chose the most frequent representative word 
form for each stem, resulting in a cluster of word 
types representing each candidate phonaes-
theme.8 Next they tested the statistical signific-
ance of this relationship by running 100 t-test 
comparisons. Each of these tests compared the 
relationship of 50 pairs of words chosen at ran-
dom from the conjectured cluster with 50 pairs of 
words chosen at random from a similarly sized 
cluster, randomly generated from the entire cor-
pus. The number of times these t-tests resulted in 
a statistically significant difference (? = .05) was 
recorded. This analysis was repeated 3 times for 
each conjectured phonaestheme and the median 
value was used as the final result. 
To determine whether a conjectured phonaes-
theme was statistically supported by their analy-
sis Otis and Sagi compared the overall frequency 
                                                 
7 It is important to note that due to the nature of a written 
corpus, the match was orthographical rather than phonetic. 
However, in most cases the two are highly congruent. 
8 Because, in this case, Otis and Sagi were not interested in 
temporal changes in meaning, they used the overall word 
vectors rather than look at each context individually. As a 
result, each of the vectors used in the analysis is based on 
occurrences in many different documents and there was no 
need to control for the variability of the documents.  
of statistically significant t-tests with the binomi-
al distribution for their ? (.05). After applying a 
Bonferroni correction for performing 50 compar-
isons, the threshold for statistical significance of 
the binomial test was for 14 t-tests out of 100 to 
turn out as significant, with a frequency of 13 
being marginally significant. Therefore, if the 
significance frequency (#Sig below) of a candi-
date phonaestheme was 15 or higher, that pho-
naestheme was judged as being supported by 
statistical evidence. Significance frequencies of 
13 and 14 were considered as indicative of a 
phonaestheme for which there was only marginal 
statistical support. 
Among Hutchins? original list of 44 possible 
phonaesthemes, 26 were found to be statistically 
reliable and 2 were marginally reliable. Overall 
the results were in line with the empirical data 
collected by Hutchins. By way of comparing the 
two datasets, #Sig and Hutchins? average rating 
measure were well correlated (r = .53). Neither 
of the unlikely phonaestheme candidates we ex-
amined were statistically supported phonaes-
themes (#Sigbr- = 6; #Sigz- = 5), whereas both of 
our newly hypothesized phonaesthemes were 
statistically supported (#Sigkn- = 28; #Sig-ign = 
23). In addition to being able to use this measure 
as a decision criterion as to whether a specific 
phonetic cluster might be phonaesthemic, it can 
also be used to compare the relative strength of 
two such clusters. For instance, in the Gutenberg 
corpus the phonaesthemic ending ?owl (e.g., 
?growl?, ?howl?; #Sig=97) was comprised of a 
cluster of words that were more similar to one 
another than ?oop (e.g., ?hoop?, ?loop?; #Sig=32).  
Such results can then be used to test the cogni-
tive effects of phonaesthemes. For instance, fol-
lowing the comparison above, we might hypo-
thesize that the word ?growl? might be a better 
semantic prime for ?howl? than the word ?hoop? 
is for the word ?loop?. In contrast, because a 
word-initial br- is not phonaesthemic, the word 
?breeze? is unlikely to be a semantic prime for 
the word ?brick?. In addition, it might be interest-
ing to combine the diachronic analysis from the 
previous section with the synchronic analysis in 
this section to investigate questions such as when 
and how phonaesthemes come to be part of a 
language and what factors might affect the 
strength of a phonaestheme. 
4 Discussion 
While the method presented in this paper is 
aimed towards quantifying semantic relation-
109
ships that were previously difficult to quantify, it 
also raises an interesting theoretical issue, name-
ly the relationship between the statistically com-
puted semantic space and the actual semantic 
content of words. On the one hand, simulations 
based on Latent Semantic Analysis have been 
shown to correlate with cognitive factors such as 
the acquisition of vocabulary and the categoriza-
tion of texts (cf. Landauer & Dumais, 1997). On 
the other hand, in reality speakers? use of lan-
guage relies on more than simple patterns of 
word co-occurrence ? For instance, we use syn-
tactic structures and pragmatic reasoning to sup-
plement the meaning of the individual lexemes 
we come across (e.g., Fodor, 1995; Grice, 1989 
[1975]). It is therefore likely that while LSA cap-
tures some of the variability in meaning exhi-
bited by words in context, it does not capture all 
of it. Indeed, there is a growing body of methods 
that propose to integrate these two disparate 
sources of linguistic information (e.g., Pado and 
Lapata, 2007; Widdows, 2003) 
Certainly, the results reported in this paper 
suggest that enough of the meaning of words and 
contexts is captured to allow interesting infe-
rences about semantic change and the relatedness 
of words to be drawn with a reasonable degree of 
certainty. However, it is possible that some im-
portant aspects of meaning are systematically 
ignored by the analysis. For instance, it remains 
to be seen whether this method can distinguish 
between processes like pejoration and amerliora-
tion as they require a fine grained distinction be-
tween ?good? and ?bad? meanings. 
Regardless of any such limitations, it is clear 
that important information about meaning can be 
gathered through a systematic analysis of the 
contexts in which words appear. Furthermore, 
phenomena such as the existence of phonaes-
themes and the success of LSA in predicting vo-
cabulary acquisition rates, suggest that the acqui-
sition of new vocabulary involves the gleaning of 
the meaning of words through their context. The 
role of context in semantic change is therefore 
likely to be an active one ? when a listener en-
counters a word they are unfamiliar with they are 
likely to use the context in which it appears, as 
well as its phonetic composition, as clues to its 
meaning. Furthermore, if a word is likewise en-
countered in context in which it is unlikely, this 
unexpected observation may induce the listener 
to adjust their representation of both the context 
and the word in order to increase the overall co-
herence of the utterance or sentence. As a result, 
it is possible that examining the contexts in 
which a word is used in different documents and 
time periods might be useful not only as a tool 
for examining the history of a semantic change 
but also as an instrument for predicting its future 
progress. Overall, this suggests a dynamic view 
of the field of semantics ? semantics as an ever-
changing landscape of meaning. In such a view, 
semantic change is the norm as the perceived 
meaning of words keeps shifting to accommo-
date the contexts in which they are used.
