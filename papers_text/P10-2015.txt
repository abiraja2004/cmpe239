Abstract
This paper introduces mNCD, a method
for automatic evaluation of machine trans-
lations. The measure is based on nor-
malized compression distance (NCD), a
general information theoretic measure of
string similarity, and flexible word match-
ing provided by stemming and synonyms.
The mNCD measure outperforms NCD in
system-level correlation to human judg-
ments in English.
1 Introduction
Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT)
systems requires automated procedures to en-
sure consistency and efficient handling of large
amounts of data. In statistical MT systems, au-
tomatic evaluation of translations is essential for
parameter optimization and system development.
Human evaluation is too labor intensive, time con-
suming and expensive for daily evaluations. How-
ever, manual evaluation is important in the com-
parison of different MT systems and for the valida-
tion and development of automatic MT evaluation
measures, which try to model human assessments
of translations as closely as possible. Furthermore,
the ideal evaluation method would be language in-
dependent, fast to compute and simple.
Recently, normalized compression distance
(NCD) has been applied to the evaluation of
machine translations. NCD is a general in-
formation theoretic measure of string similar-
ity, whereas most MT evaluation measures, e.g.,
BLEU and METEOR, are specifically constructed
for the task. Parker (2008) introduced BAD-
GER, an MT evaluation measure that uses NCD
and a language independent word normalization
method. BADGER scores were directly compared
against the scores of METEOR and word error
rate (WER). The correlation between BADGER
and METEOR were low and correlations between
BADGER and WER high. Kettunen (2009) uses
the NCD directly as an MT evaluation measure.
He showed with a small corpus of three language
pairs that NCD and METEOR 0.6 correlated for
translations of 10?12 MT systems. NCD was not
compared to human assessments of translations,
but correlations of NCD and METEOR scores
were very high for all the three language pairs.
Va?yrynen et al (2010) have extended the work
by including NCD in the ACL WMT08 evaluation
framework and showing that NCD is correlated
to human judgments. The NCD measure did not
match the performance of the state-of-the-art MT
evaluation measures in English, but it presented a
viable alternative to de facto standard BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2001), which is simple and effective
but has been shown to have a number of drawbacks
(Callison-Burch et al, 2006).
Some recent advances in automatic MT evalu-
ation have included non-binary matching between
compared items (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Agar-
wal and Lavie, 2008; Chan and Ng, 2009), which
is implicitly present in the string-based NCD mea-
sure. Our motivation is to investigate whether in-
cluding additional language dependent resources
would improve the NCD measure. We experiment
with relaxed word matching using stemming and
a lexical database to allow lexical changes. These
additional modules attempt to make the reference
sentences more similar to the evaluated transla-
tions on the string level. We report an experiment
showing that document-level NCD and aggregated
NCD scores for individual sentences produce very
similar correlations to human judgments.

2 Normalized Compression Distance
Normalized compression distance (NCD) is a sim-
ilarity measure based on the idea that a string x is
similar to another string y when both share sub-
strings. The description of y can reference shared
substrings in the known x without repetition, in-
dicating shared information. Figure 1 shows an
example in which the compression of the concate-
nation of x and y results in a shorter output than
individual compressions of x and y.
The normalized compression distance, as de-
fined by Cilibrasi and Vitanyi (2005), is given in
Equation 1, with C(x) as length of the compres-
sion of x and C(x, y) as the length of the com-
pression of the concatenation of x and y.
NCD(x, y) =
C(x, y)?min {C(x), C(y)}
max {C(x), C(y)}
(1)
NCD computes the distance as a score closer to
one for very different strings and closer to zero for
more similar strings.
NCD is an approximation of the uncomputable
normalized information distance (NID), a general
measure for the similarity of two objects. NID
is based on the notion of Kolmogorov complex-
ity K(x), a theoretical measure for the informa-
tion content of a string x, defined as the shortest
universal Turing machine that prints x and stops
(Solomonoff, 1964). NCD approximates NID by
the use of a compressor C(x) that is an upper
bound of the Kolmogorov complexity K(x).
3 mNCD
Normalized compression distance was not con-
ceived with MT evaluation in mind, but rather it
is a general measure of string similarity. Implicit
non-binary matching with NCD is indicated by
preliminary experiments which show that NCD is
less sensitive to random changes on the character
level than, for instance, BLEU, which only counts
the exact matches between word n-grams. Thus
comparison of sentences at the character level
could account better for morphological changes.
Variation in language leads to several accept-
able translations for each source sentence, which
is why multiple reference translations are pre-
ferred in evaluation. Unfortunately, it is typical
to have only one reference translation. Paraphras-
ing techniques can produce additional translation
variants (Russo-Lassner et al, 2005; Kauchak and
Barzilay, 2006). These can be seen as new refer-
ence translations, similar to pseudo references (Ma
et al, 2007).
The proposed method, mNCD, works analo-
gously to M-BLEU and M-TER, which use the
flexible word matching modules from METEOR
to find relaxed word-to-word alignments (Agar-
wal and Lavie, 2008). The modules are able to
align words even if they do not share the same
surface form, but instead have a common stem or
are synonyms of each other. A similarized transla-
tion reference is generated by replacing words in
the reference with their aligned counterparts from
the translation hypothesis. The NCD score is com-
puted between the translations and the similarized
references to get the mNCD score.
Table 1 shows some hand-picked German?
English candidate translations along with a) the
reference translations including the 1-NCD score
to easily compare with METEOR and b) the simi-
larized references including the mNCD score. For
comparison, the corresponding METEOR scores
without implicit relaxed matching are shown.
4 Experiments
The proposed mNCD and the basic NCD measure
were evaluated by computing correlation to hu-
man judgments of translations. A high correlation
value between an MT evaluation measure and hu-
man judgments indicates that the measure is able
to evaluate translations in a more similar way to
humans.
Relaxed alignments with the METEOR mod-
ules exact, stem and synonym were created
for English for the computation of the mNCD
score. The synonym module was not available
with other target languages.
4.1 Evaluation Data
The 2008 ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (Callison-Burch et al, 2008) shared
task data includes translations from a total of 30
MT systems between English and five European
languages, as well as automatic and human trans-

lation evaluations for the translations. There are
several tasks, defined by the language pair and the
domain of translated text.
The human judgments include three different
categories. The RANK category has human quality
rankings of five translations for one sentence from
different MT systems. The CONST category con-
tains rankings for short phrases (constituents), and
the YES/NO category contains binary answers if a
short phrase is an acceptable translation or not.
For the translation tasks into English, the re-
laxed alignment using a stem module and the
synonym module affected 7.5% of all words,
whereas only 5.1% of the words were changed in
the tasks from English into the other languages.
The data was preprocessed in two different
ways. For NCD we kept the data as is, which we
called real casing (rc). Since the used METEOR
align module lowercases all text, we restored the
case information in mNCD by copying the correct
case from the reference translation to the similar-
ized reference, based on METEOR?s alignment.
The other way was to lowercase all data (lc).
4.2 System-level correlation
We follow the same evaluation methodology as in
Callison-Burch et al (2008), which allows us to
measure how well MT evaluation measures corre-
late with human judgments on the system level.
Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient ? was
calculated between each MT evaluation measure
and human judgment category using the simplified
equation
? = 1?
6
?
i di
n(n2 ? 1)
(2)
where for each system i, di is the difference be-
tween the rank derived from annotators? input and
the rank obtained from the measure. From the an-
notators? input, the n systems were ranked based
on the number of times each system?s output was
selected as the best translation divided by the num-
ber of times each system was part of a judgment.
We computed system-level correlations for
tasks with English, French, Spanish and German
as the target language1.
5 Results
We compare mNCD against NCD and relate their
performance to other MT evaluation measures.
5.1 Block size effect on NCD scores
Va?yrynen et al (2010) computed NCD between a
set of candidate translations and references at the
same time regardless of the sentence alignments,
analogously to document comparison. We experi-
mented with segmentation of the candidate trans-
lations into smaller blocks, which were individ-
ually evaluated with NCD and aggregated into a
single value with arithmetic mean. The resulting
system-level correlations between NCD and hu-
man judgments are shown in Figure 2 as a function
of the block size. The correlations are very simi-
lar with all block sizes, except for Spanish, where
smaller block size produces higher correlation. An
experiment with geometric mean produced similar
results. The reported results with mNCD use max-
imum block size, similar to Va?yrynen et al (2010).

sures had negative correlation with human judgments.

Table 2 shows that real casing improves RANK
correlation slightly throughout NCD and mNCD
variants, whereas it reduces correlation in the cat-
egories CONST, YES/NO as well as the mean.
The best mNCD (PPMZ rc) improves the best
NCD (PPMZ rc) method by 15% in the RANK
category. In the CONST category the best mNCD
(bz2 lc) improves the best NCD (bz2 lc) by 3.7%.
For the total average, the best mNCD (PPMZ rc)
improves the the best NCD (bz2 lc) by 7.2%.
Table 3 shows the correlation results for the
RANK category by target language. As shown al-
ready in Table 2, mNCD clearly outperforms NCD
for English. Correlations for other languages show
mixed results and on average, mNCD gives lower
correlations than NCD.

(PPMZ rc) and NCD (bz2 rc) variants along with
the correlations for other MT evaluation methods
from the WMT?08 data, based on the results in
Callison-Burch et al (2008). The results are av-
erages over language pairs into English, sorted
by RANK, which we consider the most signifi-
cant category. Although mNCD correlation with
human evaluations improved over NCD, the rank-
ing among other measures was not affected. Lan-
guage and task specific results not shown here, re-

Table 5 shows the results from English. The ta-
ble is shorter since many of the better MT mea-
sures use language specific linguistic resources
that are not easily available for languages other
than English. mNCD performs competitively only
for French, otherwise it falls behind NCD and
other methods as already shown earlier.
6 Discussion
We have introduced a new MT evaluation mea-
sure, mNCD, which is based on normalized com-
pression distance and METEOR?s relaxed align-
ment modules. The mNCD measure outperforms
NCD in English with all tested parameter com-
binations, whereas results with other target lan-
guages are unclear. The improved correlations
with mNCD did not change the position in the
RANK category of the MT evaluation measures in
the 2008 ACL WMT shared task.
The improvement in English was expected on
the grounds of the synonym module, and indicated
also by the larger number of affected words in the

similarized references. We believe there is poten-
tial for improvement in other languages as well if
synonym lexicons are available.
We have also extended the basic NCD measure
to scale between a document comparison mea-
sure and aggregated sentence-level measure. The
rather surprising result is that NCD produces quite
similar scores with all block sizes. The different
result with Spanish may be caused by differences
in the data or problems in the calculations.
After using the same evaluation methodology as
in Callison-Burch et al (2008), we have doubts
whether it presents the most effective method ex-
ploiting all the given human evaluations in the best
way. The system-level correlation measure only
awards the winner of the ranking of five differ-
ent systems. If a system always scored second,
it would never be awarded and therefore be overly
penalized. In addition, the human knowledge that
gave the lower rankings is not exploited.
In future work with mNCD as an MT evalu-
ation measure, we are planning to evaluate syn-
onym dictionaries for other languages than En-
glish. The synonym module for English does
not distinguish between different senses of words.
Therefore, synonym lexicons found with statis-
tical methods might provide a viable alternative
for manually constructed lexicons (Kauchak and
Barzilay, 2006).
