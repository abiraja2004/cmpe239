Abstract
At present, the population of non-native
speakers is twice that of native speak-
ers. It is necessary to explore the
text generation strategies for non-native
users. However, little has been done
in this field. This study investigates
the features that affect the placement
(where to place a cue) of because for
non-native speakers. A machine learn-
ing program ? C4.5 was applied to in-
duce the classification models of the
placement.
1 Introduction
As an international language, English has become
more and more important for non-native speak-
ers. However, almost all English documents are
written for the native speakers. To some degree,
some documents can not be understood quite well
by non-native speakers. This paper concentrates
on exploring the differences in cue usage at dis-
course level between native and non-native speak-
ers. The aim is to find the decision-making mech-
anisms of text generation for users at different
reading levels.
While investigating texts written for non-native
speakers, we found that cue phrase because some-
times occurs in the first span of a discourse rela-
tion. This is different from the conclusion men-
tioned in (Quirk and Greenbaum and Leech and
Svartvik, 1972), that is, (for native speakers) be-
cause typically occurs in the second span. This
problem could be considered from the viewpoint
of text generation as well. The following three
texts may have the same abstract text structure,
though the differences among them are apparent.
E.g., cue placement is different. In text (1), cue
phrase because occurs at first span of discourse
relation ?explanation?, while in (2) and (3), be-
cause occurs in the second span.
Example 1.1:
1. Global warming will be a major threat to the
whole world over the next century. But be-
cause it will take many years for our actions
to produce a significant effect, the problem
needs attention now.
2. Global warming will be a major threat to the
whole world over the next century, but the
problem needs attention now, because it will
take many years for our actions to produce a
significant effect.
3. Global warming will be a major threat to the
whole world over the next century. But the
problem needs attention now, because it will
take many years for our actions to produce a
significant effect.
This paper reports the results of the research on
the different placement (where to place a cue) of
because between native and non-native speakers
through analyzing two annotated corpora. At the
same time, we study the features that affect place-
ment of because for non-native speakers. The rest
of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 de-
scribes related work. Section 3 demonstrates how
to create two corpora (SUB-BNC and CNNSE).

Section 4 shows the method of annotating cor-
pora. Section 5 demonstrates the difference in us-
age of because between two corpora. In section 6,
a machine learning program ? C4.5 is introduced.
Section 7 shows the experimental results. Section
8 draws a conclusion.
2 Related work
Almost all researches on cue phrases have been
done for native speakers. (Elhadad and McKe-
own, 1990) explored the problem of cue selec-
tion. They presented a model that distinguishes
a small set of similar cue phrases. (Moser and
Moore, 1995a) put forward a method to identify
the features that predict cue selection and place-
ment. (Eugenio and Moore and Paolucci, 1997)
used C4.5 to predict cue occurrence and place-
ment. Until now, the research similar to ours is
the GIRL system (Williams, 2004) which gener-
ates texts for poor readers and good readers of
native speakers. The author measured the differ-
ences of reading speed (especially cue phrases)
between good readers and bad readers, by which
they inferred how discourse level choice (e.g., cue
selection) makes the difference for the two kinds
of readers.
3 Creating two corpora
We used two corpora (SUB-BNC and CNNSE) to
investigate difference in cue usage between native
and non-native speakers. The two corpora have
the same size (200,000 words each). According
to the Flesch Reading Ease scale, the readability
of SUB-BNC and CNNSE is 47.5 (difficult) and
68.7 (easy) respectively.
The two corpora are comparable. SUB-BNC is
a sub-corpus of BNC (British National Corpus).
While creating SUB-BNC, we selected the writ-
ten texts according to the three features: domain
(?natural and pure science?), medium (?book?),
target audience (?adult?). CNNSE (Corpus of
Non-Native Speaker of English) was created by
the first author. Non-native speakers have three
levels: primary (middle school student level), in-
termediate (high school student level) and ad-
vanced (university student level). The users of
this study are assumed to be at intermediate level.
We extracted English texts (written or rewritten
by native speakers) from the books published in
China and in Japan. The target audiences of these
books were high school students in the two coun-
tries. The domain of the selected texts is natural
and pure science as well.
4 Annotating two corpora
We followed (Carlson and Marcu and Okurowski,
2001) to classify the discourse relations. In the
manual, some relations share some type of rhetor-
ical meaning, so we defined several relations as
follows:
1. background: background, circumstance
2. cause: cause, result, consequence
3. comparison: comparison, preference, anal-
ogy, proportion
4. condition: condition, hypothetical, contin-
gency, otherwise
5. contrast: contrast, concession, antithesis
6. elaboration: elaboration-additional,
elaboration-general-specific, elaboration-
part-whole, elaboration-process-step,
elaboration-object-attribute, elaboration-set-
member
7. enablement: purpose, enablement
8. evaluation: evaluation, interpretation, con-
clusion, comment
9. explanation: evidence, explanation-
argumentative, reason
10. summary: summary, restatement
Annotation includes two stages: first, we al-
lowed two coders to choose ?explanation? rela-
tions signaled by because using (Hirschberg and
Litman, 1993)?s 3-way classification. The word
because could signal not only ?explanation? rela-
tion, but other relations. On the other hand, we do
not consider some structures, e.g., ?not because
... but because?. Thus, because could be judged
as ?explanation?, ?other?, or ?not considered?. If
both coders classified because as ?explanation?,
this discourse was selected. Lastly, 228 because
were selected from two corpora.
145
At the second stage, two coders annotated the
boundary of nucleus and satellite of each dis-
course selected. Moreover, a selected discourse
could be a span (nucleus or satellite) of another
one (we call it embedding structure). The coders
labeled the discourse relation of the embedding
structure and determined the boundary of its nu-
cleus and satellite. Example 4.1 shows an exam-
ple.
Example 4.1
[Global warming will be a major threat to the
whole world over the next century.]?S? contrast
?N?[But [because it will take many years for
our actions to produce a significant effect,]?
S?explanation ?N?[the problem needs attention
now.]] (From CNNSE)
In order to assess reliability of annotation, we fol-
lowed (Moser and Moore, 1995b)?s approach to
compare the disagreements of results annotated
by two independent coders from three aspects.
First, the boundary of nucleus and satellite of
the relation signaled by because. The disagree-
ments occurred 7 times (96.9% agreement). Sec-
ond, the discourse relation of embedding struc-
ture. The disagreements occurred 16 times (93%
agreement). Third, the boundary of nucleus and
satellite of the embedding structure. The dis-
agreements occurred 9 times (96.1% agreement).
That is, the agreement of the two coders is 86%.
This is better than that mentioned in (Moser and
Moore, 1995b).
5 Analyzing the usage of because within
two corpora
Through investigating annotated SUB-BNC, we
found that there are 104 ?explanation? relations
signaled by because, in which 96/104 (92.3%)
(Table 1) occurs in the second span. This con-
clusion is the same as (Quirk and Greenbaum
and Leech and Svartvik, 1972) and (Moser and
Moore, 1995b)? opinion, i.e., because typically
occurs in the second span. However, within
CNNSE, we found that only 88/124 (71%) occurs
in the second span. This result is quite different
from that of SUB-BNC. Moreover, Chi Square
critical values (?2 = 16.54, p < 0.001) also sup-
port this conclusion.

SUB-BNC 8 96
CNNSE 36 88

6 Machine learning program ? C4.5
6.1 Evaluation method
The results of C4.5 are learned classification mod-
els from the training sets. The error rates of the
learned models are estimated by cross-validation
(Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), which is widely
applied to evaluating decision trees, especially
whose dataset is relatively small. Data for learn-
ing is randomly divided into N test sets. The pro-
gram is run for N times, each run uses (N-1) test
sets as the training set and the remaining one as
the test set. The error rate of a tree obtained by us-
ing the whole dataset for training is then assumed
to be the average error rate on the test set over the
N runs (Eugenio and Moore and Paolucci, 1997).
The advantage of this method is that all data are
eventually used for testing, and almost all exam-
ples are used in any given training run (Litman,
1996). This study follows (Eugenio and Moore
and Paolucci, 1997) (Litman, 1996)? s approach
to identify the best learned models by comparing
their error rates to the error rates of the other mod-
els. The method of determining whether two error
rates are significantly different is by computing
and comparing the 95% confidence intervals for
the two error rates. If the upper bound of the 95%
confidence interval for error rate ?1 is lower than
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
for ?2, then the difference between ?1 and ?2 is
considered to be significant.
6.2 Features
We classified features into two groups: sentence
features and embedding structure features. Sen-
tence features are concerned with the information
of relations signaled by because. Nt and St rep-
resent tense of nucleus and satellite respectively.
Nv and Sv represent voice of nucleus and satel-
lite respectively. We also used the features Ng
(nucleus length) and Sg (satellite length). Mean-
146
while, nucleus structure (Ns) and satellite struc-
ture (Ss) were considered.
Another group of features reflect information
of the embedding structures that contain relations
signaled by because. R represents discourse re-
lation of the embedding structure. C represents
whether the embedding structure is cued or not.
N-S indicates that in the embedding structure, the
relation signaled by because could be either nu-
cleus or satellite. P indicates that the relation sig-
naled by because could occur either in the first
span or in the second span. Bs represents the
structure of the span containing the relation sig-
naled by because. Os represents the structure of
the span not containing the relation signaled by
because. Features used in the experiments are as
follows:
? Sentence features
? Nt. Tense of nucleus: past, present, fu-
ture.
? St. Tense of satellite: past, present, fu-
ture.
? Nv. Voice of nucleus: active, passive.
? Sv. Voice of satellite: active, passive.
? Ng. Length of nucleus (in words): inte-
ger.
? Sg. Length of satellite (in words): inte-
ger.
? Ns. Structure of nucleus: simple, other.
? Ss. Structure of satellite: simple, other.
? Embedding structure features
? R. Discourse relation of embedding
structure: attribution, background,
cause, comparison, condition, con-
trast, elaboration, example, enable-
ment, evaluation, explanation, list,
summary, temporal.
? C. Signaled by cue or not: yes, no.
? N-S. Role of the relation signaled by
because: nucleus, satellite.
? P. Position of relation signaled by be-
cause: first span, second span.
? Bs. Structure of the span containing the
relation signaled by because: complex
sentence, other.
? Os. Structure of the span not contain-
ing the relation signaled by because:
simple sentence, other.
7 Experiments
We divided the experiments into four sets. Exper-
iment Set 1 were run for examining the best indi-
vidual feature whose predictive power was better
than the baseline. Experiment Set 2, 3 and 4 were
run for classifying the placement of because. In
Experiment Set 2, we only used sentence features.
In Experiment Set 3, we used both sentence fea-
tures and embedding structure features. Experi-
ment Set 4 were run using only embedding struc-
ture features.
7.1 Experiment Set 1
First we introduce a concept ? baseline, which
can be obtained by choosing the majority class.
E.g., 71.0% (88/124) because occurs in the sec-
ond span. That is, if because is placed directly
in the second span, one would be wrong 29% of
the times. So 29% is the error rate of the baseline
model that is used in the experiment.
We ran the experiment 14 times using each
feature mentioned above. By analyzing the re-
sults, we found that only feature R has predictive
power. Because the 95% confidence interval of its
error rate was 16.2 ? 0.7, whose upper bound for
error rate (16.9%) was much lower than the base-
line (29%). Table 2 shows the results by using
feature R. When discourse relation of the embed-
ding structure is ?cause?, ?contrast?, ?example?,
or ?explanation?, because occurs in the first span.
......
R = cause: first span (14.0/5.0)
......
R = contrast: first span (14.0/5.0)
.....
R = example: first span (5.0/1.0)
......
R = explanation: first span (4.0)
......

7.2 Experiment Set 2
Experiment Set 2 had four subsets. Each exper-
iment was run only using sentence features (Ta-
ble 3). In the first experiment, all eight sen-
tence features were used. However, the upper
bound of the 95% confidence interval for error
rate (34.1%) was higher than the baseline (29%).
So the learned model was not a good one. Then
we ran three other experiments using a combina-
tion of different sentence features. In subset 2, the
features representing span structure (Ns and Ss)
were deleted. In subset 3, compared with the first
one, span length (Ng and Sg) were deleted. In
subset 4, only the features relating to span length
(Ng and Sg) and span structure (Ns and Ss) were
used. However, no good classification model was
obtained.
7.3 Experiment Set 3
Experiment Set 3 had four subsets as well. In the
first subset, experiment was run using all sentence
features and embedding structure features. Ex-
perimental results show that the upper bound of
the 95% confidence interval for error rate (26%)
was lower than the baseline (29%). It means that
embedding structure feature(s) could improve the
accuracy of the learned classification models. In
the next three experiments, we tried three other
feature combinations. One feature set concerned
with the placement of because (P) and span struc-
ture (Ns and Ss, Bs and Os). Experimental
results show that the average error rate is higher
than the baseline. In subset 3, two sentence fea-
tures (Ng and Sg) and two embedding structure
features (C and N-S) were added. However, the
average error rate of the learned model was still
higher than the baseline. It means that these four
features can not help to improve the accuracy of
classification models. In subset 4, feature R was
added. Though the average error rate was lower
than subset 2 and 3, its upper bound of the 95%
confidence interval for error rate was higher than
the baseline. The fourth learned model can not be
regarded as a good one.
7.4 Experiment Set 4
Experiment Set 4 had five subsets. In subset 1, the
experiment was run using all the six embedding
structure features. The upper bound of the 95%
confidence interval for error rate of the learned
model was lower than the baseline. In subset 2,
we ran the experiment by deleting one feature R
from subset 1. Its average error rate was higher
than that of subset 1, and its upper bound of the
95% confidence interval for error rate was higher
than the baseline. It again proves that R is the fea-
ture that affects the accuracy of learned models.
In the subset 3 and 4, experiments were run by
deleting feature C and P respectively. The aver-
age error rates of the results were nearly the same
as that of subset 1. It demonstrates that features C

5 x x x x 21.9 ? 3.6
Table 5: Feature sets and 95%-confidence intervals for the error rates (%) of

and P do not affect the accuracy of learned mod-
els. In the subset 5, features Bs and Os were
deleted from the subset 1. The experimental re-
sult did not change so much as well. So we can
infer that span structure do not affect the accuracy
of the learned model.
7.5 Discussion
The experimental results show that machine
learning program C4.5 is useful to induce a clas-
sification model of placement of because for non-
native speakers. The results of Experiment Set
1 demonstrate that feature R is the best individ-
ual feature whose predictive power is better than
the baseline. Experiment Set 2 and 3 show that
good learned model can not be obtained using
sentence features, or the combination of sentence
features and embedding structure features. The
results of Experiment Set 4 demonstrate that high
performing classification models can be obtained
by combining feature R with several other embed-
ding structure features. However, the best learned
model can?t be obtained.
8 Conclusion
This study proves that the placement of because
is connected with reading ease. We used a ma-
chine learning program to induce the best classi-
fication model of placement of because for non-
native speakers. The experiment results show that
discourse relation of embedding structure is the
most powerful feature to predict the placement of
because. E.g., when relation is ?cause?, ?con-
trast?, ?example? or ?explanation?, because oc-
curs in the first span. The heuristics obtained from
machine learning experiments can be applied to
NLG systems.
