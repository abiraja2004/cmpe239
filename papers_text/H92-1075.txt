ABSTRACT 
Recently, the DARPA community started a new data col- 
lection initiative in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) domain 
to support research and development of very large vocabu- 
lary continuous speech recognition (CSR) systems. Since Au- 
gust 1991, our group has actively participated in the develop- 
ment of the WSJ-CSR corpus. The purpose of this paper is 
to document our involvement in this process, from recording 
and transcription to analyses and distribution. We will also 
present the results of an experiment investigating the prepro- 
cessing of the prompt ext. 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the key ingredients that has contributed to 
the steady improvement in speech recognition technol- 
ogy in recent years is the availability of large speech cor- 
pora \[1,3,7,8\]. With the help of these corpora, researchers 
have been able to develop recognition systems and obtain 
reliable estimates of system parameters. Perhaps just 
as important, these corpora, together with standardized 
performance evaluation procedures and metrics, have en- 
couraged objective comparison of different systems, lead- 
ing to better understanding and cross fertilization of re- 
search ideas \[4\]. 
The various speech corpora that the DARPA commu- 
nity has collected serve a wide range of purposes. The 
TIMIT corpus was designed with acoustic-phonetic re- 
search in mind. The Resource Management corpus ad- 
dresses the needs for developing recognition systems with 
moderate vocabulary (1,000 words) and perplexity (60, 
with a word-pair language model). The VOYACER and 
ATIS corpora contain spontaneously generated speech, 
and are useful for spoken language system development. 
All the presently available corpora have moderate vocab- 
ulary sizes and perplexities, and thus cannot adequately 
support research and development of very large vocab- 
ulary continuous peech recognition (CSR) systems in 
American English 2. As a result, the DARPA community

N00014-89-J-1332, monitored through the Office of Naval Research. 
2A large corpus of spoken French has recently been collected by

recently initiated an effort towards the construction of a 
new corpus to meet these needs. 
The domain chosen by the community is the Wall 
Street Journal (WSJ), and the text prompts are selected 
from the CD-ROM distributed by ACL/DCI \[5\]. While 
the ultimate goal is to collect around 300 hours of speech 
from more than 100 speakers, it was thought that we 
should collect a pilot corpus of approximately 40 hours, 
partly to satisfy near term needs and partly to debug the 
text preprocessing and data collection processes. Since 
August 1991, our group is one of three that actively par- 
ticipated in the collection of the WSJ-CSR pilot corpus 3. 
The purpose of this paper is to document our involvement 
in this process, present some comparative analyses of the 
resulting data, and describe an experiment investigating 
the preparation of the prompt text. 
DATA COLLECTION 
The Env i ronment  
All the MIT data are collected in an office environ- 
ment, where the ambient noise level is approximately 
50dB on the A scale of a sound-level meter. All ut- 
terances are collected simultaneously using two micro- 
phones. A Sennheiser HMD-410 noise cancelling micro- 
phone is always used for one of the channels. For the 
other channel, we rotate among the sessions three micro- 
phones: a Crown PCC-160 phase coherent cardioid desk- 
top microphone, a Crown PZM-6FS boundary desk-top 
microphone, and a Sony ECM-50PS electret condenser 
lavaliere microphone. The data are collected using a Sun 
SPARCstation-II, which has been augmented with an 
Ariel DSP S-32C board and ProPort-656 audio interface 
unit for data capture. The sampling rate is 16 kHz, and 
the signal is lowpass filtered at 7.2 kHz. The input gain 
is held constant, for all subjects, at a setting that maxi- 
mizes the signal-to-noise ratio without clipping. Rather 
than transferring each collected sentence immediately to 
a remote file server for storage, and thus increasing the 
French researchers\[2\]. TheBREF corpus contains over 200 hours 
of speech, collected from over 100 subjects.

data temporarily on a 200 MByte local disk. 
The prompt text, i.e., the text used to elicit speech 
material from the subjects, has been preprocessed by 
Doug Paul of Lincoln Lab to remove reading ambiguities 
inherent in written text \[5\]. Approximately half of the 
prompt text contains verbalized punctuation, whereas 
the remainder does not. The prompt text is displayed 
one paragraph at a time in the hope that this will en- 
courage the subjects to produce sentence-level prosodic 
phenomena. The sentence to be recorded is highlighted 
in yellow, and the highlighting automatically moved for- 
ward to the next sentence once the previous entence has 
been accepted. Four buttons (icons that can be activated 
with the mouse) are available for the subject o record, 
playback, accept, or unaccept an utterance. A push-and- 
hold mechanism is used for recording. We developed this 
user interface nvironment in the hope that it will enable 
subjects to record the data with minimum supervision. 
Our experience with pilot data collection indicates that 
this is indeed the case. In fact, this software and hard- 
ware environment has also been adopted by one of the 
two remaining sites collecting WSJ-CSR data. 
The  Process  
Subjects were recruited from the MIT community and 
vicinity via e-mail and posters. They were separated into 
three categories depending on how their data would be 
used for system development and evaluation: speaker- 
independent (SI), speaker-adaptive (SA), and speaker- 
dependent (SD). An attempt was made to balance the 
speakers by sex, dialect, and age, particularly for the 
latter two groups, since the total number of speakers in 
these groups is relatively small. 
368 
Data were collected in sessions of approximately 100 
utterances (about 40 minutes per session). Each new sub- 
ject was asked to read a set of instructions introducing 
them to the task. After that, the experimenter helped 
the subjects practice using the mouse for recording. The 
entire introduction took about 5 minutes. The subjects 
were then asked to read the designated set of 40 speaker 
adaptation sentences provided by Dragon Systems. The 
experimenter monitored the recording of the adaptation 
sentences, and asked the subject o repeat a sentence if a 
mistake was made. All subsequent recordings were made 
without supervision. Approximately half of the prompt 
texts for each subject contained verbalized punctuations. 
Subjects belonging to the SA and SD categories returned 
for multiple sessions. However, the introduction and the 
reading of the adaptation sentences took place only dur- 
ing the first session. 
Once the data were recorded, they were authenti- 
cated. To this end, we developed an interactive nvi- 
ronment in which an experimenter could listen to an ut- 
terance, visually examine the waveform to detect runca- 
tion, and edit the orthographic transcription when nec- 
essary. Finally, the speech data and the corresponding 
orthographic transcriptions were written onto CD-ROM- 
compatible WORM disks for distribution. 
The  Sta tus  
We started the collection of WSJ-CSR data in early 
October, 1991, and completed the pilot collection by year 
end. Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of all 
the subjects that we have recorded thus far. Their age 
ranges from 17 to 52 years, with an average of 27.1 years 
and a standard eviation of 6.6 years. A breakdown of

gories is shown in Table 1. While we only committed 
ourselves at the onset to collect up to 50% of the pilot 
data, in the final analysis we were able to collect nearly 
twice as much data in all categories. All the data that we 
collected, totaling more than 8 GBytes, have been deliv- 
ered to NIST and other research institutions for system 
development, training, and evaluation. 
DATA ANALYSES 
Since the WSJ-CSR speech corpus differs in many 
dimensions from the other corpora that we have collected 
thus far in the DARPA community, we thought it would 
be useful to compute some of its vital statistics. In this 
section, we will describe some of the analyses that we 
have performed thus far. 
All the analyses are based on only the data from the 
training set, including the SI, SA, and SD categories ~.
The results are summarized in Table 2. In addition to 
computing various measures for the entire data set, we 
have also analyzed the adaptation sentences, and those 
with and without verbalized punctuation. 
Table 2 indicates that the MIT training set contains 
nearly 15,000 sentences, and the number of sentences 
with and without verbalized punctuation are approxi- 
mately equal. These sentences contain over 250,000 words, 
resulting in an average of approximately 17 words per 
sentence. The sentence length ranges from one word to 
31 words and has a standard eviation of 6.6 words. The 
4We have excluded the development and test sets because of our 
desire to keep them uncontaminated for future system development 
and evaluation. 
369 
sentences are considerably longer than any of the data 
that we have collected in other domains \[1,6,8\]. The 
adaptation sentences are generally shorter than the WSJ 
sentences. Some speakers found them difficult to pro- 
nounce, and needed to be corrected repeatedly, whereas 
others uttered them with no apparent difficulty. On aver- 
age, verbalizing the punctuations adds an extra 2.5 words 
to each sentence. 
To compute the duration of these sentences we first 
passed each sentence through an automatic begin-and- 
end detector to remove any extraneous ilences. Alto- 
gether, the MIT training set contains almost 100,000 sec- 
onds of speech material, or about 27 hours. The average 
duration of the sentences i 6.5 seconds. The correspond- 
ing speaking rate is 156 words per minute, which is 30% 
higher than that for the spontaneous speech that we have 
collected \[6\]. This discrepancy is presumably due to the 
inherent difference in the way speech is elicited. 
In collecting the WSJ-CSR data, we hoped to pro- 
vide an interface that was easy for the subjects to use, so 
that costly on-line monitoring was not necessary. How- 
ever, this potential cost reduction may be offset by the 
cost of authentication if the subjects produce too many 
errors. The sentences containing errors have the added 
disadvantage of not being well matched to the language 
model, which is constructed from the prompt text. 
To gain some insight into the magnitude of this prob- 
lem, we tabulated the discrepancies between the final or- 
thographic transcription and the corresponding prompt 
text. The result, summarized in the last row of Table 2, 
show that 697, or 0.27% of the words were read with 
error (including substitutions, insertions, and deletions). /

Table 3: Examples of most common reading confusions. 
Note that, while the number of words read with errors 
for the adaptation sentences were one-tenth of that for 
the WSJ sentences, the percentage of errors for the adap- 
tation sentences is only about one-third of that for the 
WSJ sentences. Recall that the adaptation sentences 
were read with an experimenter monitoring the process 
and instructing the subject to repeat when an error is 
detected. Thus, while monitoring the data collection 
process can reduce the errors by a factor of three, the 
magnitude of the problem is relatively small. Therefore, 
we believe our original hypothesis was reasonable. 
Example confusions can be seen in Table 3 which lists 
all substitutions (computed by finding the best alignment 
between the prompt and spoken word strings) which oc- 
curred two or more times in the training portion of the 
corpus. Note that many of these are due to the speaker 
expanding abbreviations ("R. I." becomes "Rhode Is- 
land" for example). Since this would not occur in the 
verbalized punctuation text (the prompt would be "R 
.period I .period"), it is likely that these expanded ab- 
breviations accounted for the slightly higher error rate in 
the non-verbalized punctuation portions. 
In the final analysis, the entire MIT training set, con- 
taining 27 hours of usable speech, was collected in ap- 
proximately 125 40-minute sessions (approximately 30 
minutes of speaking with 10 minutes of setup and in- 
370 
struction). Thus three hours of subject time is required 
to collect one hour of speech. Adding the overhead of 
recruiting and scheduling subjects, authentication, and 
other related administrative matters, we estimate that 
6-8 hours of time is needed for one hour of speech. 
EXPERIMENT ON TEXT 
PREPROCESSING 
As mentioned earlier, the WSJ-CSR pilot effort is in- 
tended to satisfy our near term research needs, so that 
researchers can begin to develop very large vocabulary 
speech recognition algorithms and systems. The pilot ef- 
fort also affords us the opportunity to experiment with 
prompt ext preprocessing and data collection procedures, 
so that we can refine the procedure for the final, and con- 
siderably larger data collection initiative. In this section, 
we describe an experiment that we have conducted con- 
cerning the preprocessing of the text prompts. 
The prompt ext used for the pilot collection has been 
preprocessed by Lincoln Lab \[5\]. The rationale for this 
preprocessing step is at least two-fold. First, by con- 
verting numbers and abbreviations to a standard format, 
one removes any ambiguity concerning how these items 
should be read. Second, forcing the subjects to read the 
text in some pre-determined format will result in speech 
data that is consistent with the language model, which is 
derived from a considerably larger quantity of text data. 
However, some researchers felt that this preprocessing 
step may unnecessarily restrict the ways these items can 
be pronounced. Thus the data that we collect may not 
accurately reflect realistic situations in which a user is 
asked to dictate. 
In order to gain some understanding of the effect of 
this preprocessing step, we recently conducted a small 
experiment. We first selected 100 sentences in the train- 
ing set that contain one or more items that are candi- 
dates for preprocessing. Examples of some of the se- 
lected sentences are shown in Table 4. These sentences 
are presented to the subjects, unprocessed, for recording. 
Following the recording, each utterance is carefully tran- 
scribed orthographically, and the resulting transcription 
is then compared with the processed prompt text used 
during the pilot data collection to determine if there ex- 
ist any discrepancies. For this experiment, we recruited 
12 subjects, 6 male and 6 female. Three male and three 
Back then the distribution was $2.10 annually. 
For the 1987 first 9 months, it had a $2.4 M net loss. 
A W-4 form can be revived whenever necessary.

crepancy with the processed prompt ext prompt ext. 
The results of the experiment can be analyzed in sev- 
eral ways. Figure 2 shows a histogram of the number 
of distinct renditions produced by the 12 subjects for 
the 100 sentences. There is considerable variation in the 
production of these sentences. The average number of 
distinct renditions is 3.9, with a standard eviation of 
2.4. The figure shows that only 12 of the 100 sentences 
resulted in readings that agreed unanimously with the 
processed prompt text. Approximately half of the sen- 
tence tokens (601 out of  1,200) are identical to the cor- 
responding prompt ext. 5 
Figure 2 shows that, for almost 90% of the sentences 
used in this experiment, he subjects produced at least 
one rendition that differed in some way from the pro- 
cessed prompt text. But is this prompt text the pre- 
ferred way of producing the sentences by our subjects? 
To answer this question, we computed the rank of the 
processed prompt text for each sentence which showed 
that the processed prompt ext corresponds to (or is at 
least tied with) the most frequently produced rendition 
in over 60% of our sentences. Over 90% of the time, it is 
within the top three. 
A closer examination ofthe 100 sentences showed that 
there were 171 locations where there was a discrepancy

differences due to prior experience with the WSJ data collection.

between the processed prompt text and at least one of 
the 12 recorded orthographies. 49 of these seemed to be 
reading errors and consisted of a single word deletion, 
insertion, or substitution, and were typically produced 
by only one of the 12 speakers. An additional 14 dis- 
crepancies were due the addition of verbalized sentence 
punctuation (the subjects were not asked to verbalize 
punctuation). 
Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the orthographies a - 
sociated with the remaining 108 discrepancies (which cor- 
responds to 1296 substrings). 635 or 49% of these strings 
corresponded to the processed prompt ext. Our analy- 
sis divided the majority of the remainder into three cat- 
egories: numbers, abbreviations, and dates. 
Numbers were involved in 81 of the 108 discrepan- 
cies and, as shown in Figure 3, were mainly due to five 
factors. The most frequently occurring variation (169 in- 
stances) was where the word %nd" was inserted into a 
string in order to break up a large number sequence (e.g. 
"two hundred and thirty four" instead of "two hundred 
thirty four"). The second most common source of vari- 
ation (122 instances) involved monetary denominations. 
In these cases the word "dollar" was often deleted. The 
third factor involved variations in the way decimal num- 
bers were spoken (108 instances). These changes typi- 
cally involved changing a digit sequence to tens or teens 
(e.g. "two point thirty four" instead of C'two point three 
four"), or substituting the word "zero" for the word "oh" 
(e.g. "one point zero two" instead of "one point oh two"). 
The remaining two most common factors involved 60 in- 
stances where the word "zero" was deleted (or replaced 
by the word "oh") from a purely decimal number (e.g. 
"point three percent" instead of "zero point three per- 
cent"), and 33 instances where the word "one" was re- 
placed by "a" in a number or fraction beginning with a 
one (e.g. "one and a half" instead of "one and one half"). 
Abbreviations accounted for 20 additional discrepan- 
cies. As shown in Figure 3, eleven of these discrepancies 
involved 40 instances where subjects aid the contracted 
form of an abbreviation (e.g. "Corp" or "In,") instead 
of the expanded form used in the processed prompt text. 
Conversely, there were five substrings where nearly half 
the subjects (a total of 29 out of 60 instances) did ex- 
pand a string which was not expanded in the processed 
prompt text (e.g. "E.S.T" spoken as "Eastern Standard 
Time"). The third factor which accounted for variations 
in the way abbreviations were pronounced was the word 
"slash" as in "P.S. slash two". Subjects had a definite 
preference for deleting the slash in this context, although 
two returning subjects did remember to say the slash in 
3 instances out of 24. 
The remaining seven discrepancies involved dates and 
were nearly all due to the day being spoken as a cardi- 
nal number (e.g."ten") rather than the ordinal number 
(e.g."tenth") provided by the prompt text. The cardinal 
number was used 18 times in our data. The single excep- 
tion to this was one instance where a subject said "the 
seventh" instead of "seventh". 
Taken together, these nine factors were involved in 
104 of the 108 discrepancies, and accounted for all but 
44 of the 1296 substrings uttered by the subjects (96.6%). 
These remaining differences nearly all involved numbers, 
and could be analyzed further of course (for instance, 
three of the remaining discrepancies involved report num- 
bers, where the number was often spoken as a sequence 
of single digits). However, the results of our investigation 
indicated to us that although there is a large variation 
in the way the subjects have spoken these unprocessed 
sentences, the types of variation is fairly limited. In ad- 
dition, the magnitude of the these variations would be 
smaller in the overall corpus since we only presented un- 
processed sentences that seemed to have ambiguous re- 
alizations. Nevertheless, we are still faced with the ques- 
tion of whether or not to preprocess the data. Before we 
can answer this question definitively, it is important that 
we conduct further study on a larger sample of sentences 
using a larger number of subjects. In the end, the de- 
cision of whether to preprocess the text will have to be 
determined by the community who will be the consumers 
of the resulting data, after considering the objectives of 
the research program and the trade-offs between a more 
reliable language model and more realistic speech data.

SUMMARY 
This paper describes our involvement in the collec- 
tion of the WSJ-CSR pilot corpus. By paying close at- 
tention to developing a computer interface that is easy 
to use, we were able to collect over 33 hours of speech 
from 64 subjects over a relatively short period. By us- 
ing in-house quipment to produce CD-ROM-compatible 
WORM disks, we were able to distribute the data to 
interested researchers apidly. Our analyzes of the col- 
lected data show that the WSJ-CSR corpus differs signifi- 
cantly from other corpora in the research community. We 
expect that it will have long-lasting impacts on speech 
recognition research within the DARPA community and 
around the world. 
The preliminary text preprocessing experiment that 
we conducted suggests that the current preprocessing 
scheme may not be adequate in capturing the ways peo- 
ple would naturally speak the sentences. Clearly, more 
extensive xperiments must be performed. Whether one 
should preprocess the text at all is a decision that the 
community must decide collectively. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
The collection of the WSJ-CSR data received help 
from many members of the Spoken Language Systems 
Group at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. In 
particular, Christie Clark Winterton was responsible for 
recruiting, scheduling, and assisting the subjects. She 
also authenticated a large fraction of the orthographic 
transcriptions of the collected ata.
