Abstract 
We present a procedure that determines a set 
of phonemes possibly intended by a speaker 
from a recognized or uttered phone. This in- 
formation will be used to allow a speech rec- 
ognizer to take pronunciation i to account or 
to consider input from a noisy source during 
lexical access. We investigate the hypothesis 
that different pronunciations ofa phone occur 
within groups of sounds physically produced 
the same way, and use the Minimum Message 
Length principle to consider the effect of a 
phoneme's context on its pronunciation. 
1 Introduction 
When trying to match spoken words to dictionary 
entries during speech recognition, it is useful to be 
able to generate alternative versions of the spoken 
sequences of phones to account for the manner in 
which different speakers pronounce a phone. If we 
know the probabilities that the component sounds 
in a sequence of phones are pronounced like other 
sounds, then likely alternative pronunciations of 
that sequence of phones can be generated to match 
against a lexicon of known words. Furthermore, if
we also have some idea of how the context within 
which a phone was uttered affects its pronunciation, 
we have extra information which can be used to pro- 
duce more realistic alternative pronunciations. 
This paper considers the task of automatically 
extracting statistical information about how vari- 
ous sound sections of words (phonemes) are pro- 
nounced by speakers (as phones) by matching in- 
tended phonemes and uttered phones from a tran- 
scribed speech corpus. The same approach could 
be used to gather statistics about how phones rec- 
ogaized (or mis-recognized) by a speech recognizer 
match the phonemes intended by a speaker. 
This information extraction process is part of the 
training phase for the lexical access component of a 
speech recognition system, where the pronunciation 
probabilities are generated from a training corpus. 
The study was done on the TIMIT corpus (Fisher 
et al, , 1986) - -  a collection of American-English 
read sentences with correct time-aligned acoustic- 
phonetic and orthographic (word-aligned) transcrip- 
tions. 1 The corpus contains 3696 sentences spoken 
by 462 speakers from 8 different dialect divisions 
across the United States. 
Previous work by Riley (1989) and Withgott 
and Chen (1993) used Classification and Regression 
Trees (CART) on a large number of different features 
of the corpus (such as genderi dialect and speaking 
rate) to obtain pronunciation i formation of inten- 
ded phonemes. Our system obtain~ similar results 
using positional information and context, and us- 
ing exact matches from uttered phones to intended 
phonemes to guide other matches. 
Work by Cohen et (d., (1987) on pronunciation 
used a couple of set sentences for multiple speakers, 
but did not cover a wide range of words (and thus 
different phone contexts). Our study considers the 
pronunciation patterns of a wide range of different 
speakers using a large collection of words. 
A tree-based system by Luccassen and Mercer 
(1984) uses an information theoretic approach for 
deciding alternative pronunciations based on the 
classification of a large context feature vector. How- 
ever, when building their decision tree, they do not 
evaluate the quality of the resulting tree, i.e., they 
keep testing attributes until a boundary situation 
is reached. In contrast, our system initially uses 
the relative positioning of uttered phones and inten- 
ded phonemes to determine the phonemes possibly 
intended by a speaker when uttering a particular 
phone. The context of a phone is considered only as 
1Transcriptions were made by a combination ofhand 
transcriptions u ing multiple parametric representations 
of sentences as a guide, and automatic alignment (Zue 
and Seneff, 1988). The use of different representations 
is claimed as a good way of overcoming dialect biases 
during transcription (Withgott and Chen, 1993).

an extra source of information to qualify these pre- 
dictions. Further, the method we apply for building 
decision trees evaluates whether context is meaning- 
ful in terms of its predictive power. 
Riley (1991) implements a similar system using 
a different method for tree induction, but esti- 
mates the probability of an uttered phoneme given 
a phoneme context and a partial phone context, 
whereas we are inferring an intended phoneme from 
an uttered phone context. 
Our specific aim is to test two hypotheses: (1) that 
phonemes are pronounced as phones in the same 
broad sound category (for example, vowels for vowels 
and fricatives for fricatives), and (2) that the context 
of a phone, that is, the attributes of the phones im- 
mediately preceding and following it, influence the 
pronunciation of this phone. 
2 Determining Alternative 
Pronunciations 
For each word in each sentence in the corpus, we 
match the transcribed phones with the phonemes 
in that word as recorded in a lexicon, and record 
the frequency of occurrence ofeach phoneme/phone 
match over the entire corpus. The major difficulties 
in this process are (1) transcriptions include extra 
phones that do not appear in the phoneme sequences 
corresponding to words in the lexicon, and (2) there 
are expected phones that were not pronounced. As 
a result, the phone sequences rarely align exactly 
with the phonemes corresponding to the words in the 
lexicon. This makes a simple alignment unreliable, 
and calls for a more flexible method of matching. 
Our method consists of examining the words of 
the corpus aligned with their lexicon entries, and 
choosing phoneme to phone pairs that we are confi- 
dent are a match. This information is then used to 
make further matches in less certain areas. This pro- 
cess has three main steps: (1) aligning each corpus 
word with its corresponding lexicon entry, (2) build- 
ing initial data structures, and (3) iteratively making 
additional certain matches. 
2.1 Aligning Corpus Words with Lexicon 
Entries 
We use the dynamic string alignment algorithm de- 
scribed by Sandoff and Kruskal (1983) to determine 
the minimum number of substitutions, insertions 
and deletions needed to turn one string into another. 
This algorithm can produce several edit sequences 
with the same cost, so the edit sequence with the 
highest number of exact matches is selected. Ta- 
ble 1 describes elected symbols from the ARPA- 
bet symbol set (Shoup, 1980) used for representing 
phonemes and phones in TIMIT. 2 A typical align- 
ment of words in a sentence is given in Figure 1. The 
first row contains phonemes from the lexicon words, 
and the second row contains phones from the corre- 
sponding words in a corpus sentence. Note the use 
of C to represent the sharing of the N phone between 
mayan and neoclassic due to co-articulation. 
The TIMIT transcriptions of sentences use some 
symbols that are not present in the lexicon entries. 
For example, stop closures (bcl, dcl, gcl, pcl, tcl, 
kcl) and releases (b, d, g, p, t, k) are provided 
in the corpus transcriptions, but only releases are 
used in the lexicon entries. In order to prevent his 
mismatch from causing the surrounding phones to

be misaligued, we remove stop closures when they 
appear before stop releases. For example, in Figure 1 
we have removed the kcl closure that preceded the 
first K phone in neoclassic, but the final kcl of that 
word was not removed because there was no release 
found for that closure (we don't want to eliminate 
the evidence of the k sound completely). 
2.2 Building Initial Data Structures 
We scan through each aligned word pair in every 
sentence in the corpus and record certain matches 
and uncertain areas, generating frequency counts of 
the certain matches. 
A certain match is a pairing between aphoneme in 
a lexicon word and a phone in the same corpus word 
which we are confident represent the same intended 
sound. Initially, the certain matches are insertions, 
deletions and substitutions bounded immediately on

Figure 2: Example of (a) uncertain co-articulation, 
and (b) multiple choice matches 
the left and right by an exact match or the beginning 
or end of a word. Since we know the boundaries of 
words from the transcriptions, we can reliably match 
up phonemes on word boundaries provided they are 
bounded on the other side by an exact match. Ex- 
act matches are also recorded as certain matches. In 
the sentence in Figure 1, ow/ix in neoclassic s a 
certain match, as is ih/ ix in disappeared, hh/ax 
and ay /aa  in while, and ix/- in surveying. 
An uncertain area is a group of two or more opera- 
tions (insert, delete or substitute) bounded by a cer- 
tain match or the beginning or end of a word. Exam- 
pies of uncertain areas in Figure 1 are the last three 
operations in ancient and the second and third op- 
erations in ruins. Uncertain areas potentially have 
matches within them, but we have not committed to 
an aligmnent at this stage. 
TIMIT uses a number of phonological rules for 
sharing and deleting phones on the boundaries of 
the words in the transcriptions ( uch as shown be- 
tween the second and third word in Figure 1). These 
rules correspond to cases of co-articulation f phones 
(Giachin et aL,, 1991). Such co-articulated phones 
remove word boundaries, resulting in the concatena- 
tion of the end of a word with the beginning of the 
next word. For example, Figure 2(a) illustrates how 
co-articulation ofthe words did you renders the en- 
tire phone sequence an uncertain area. In contrast, 
the co-articulated N/N  phones between mayan and 
neoclassic n Figure 1 constitutes a certain match. 
2.3 Making Addit ional Certain Matches  
We use frequency counts of certain matches obtained 
in Step 2 to generate additional certain matches from 
the uncertain areas. To this effect, we consider each 
possible phoneme/phone match in each uncertain 
area, and select he phoneme/phone match with the 
highest frequency of certain matches. For instance, 
if the match n /en  occurs more often than n/tel ,  
then n /en  will be chosen in the uncertain area be- 
tween SH and the end of ancient in Figure 1. 
Whenever there are multiple instances of the same 
phoneme in an uncertain area, it is matched to the 
phone that is positionally closest. For example, both

d phonemes in the uncertain area in Figure 2(b) 
match the phones dx and dcl. In this case, we match 
the first d tO dx  and the second  to del. During this 
process, we consider only potential phone/phoneme 
matches, and we ignore any match involving a "-" 
symbol (which indicates an insertion or a deletion). 
Insertions and deletions that are certain matches are 
collected for statistical purposes but do not influence 
the match decision process. 
After a phoneme/phone match has been deter- 
mined, the phonemes and phones of the uncertain 
area are shifted so that the matched phoneme and 
phone are lined up. This new match is then removed 
from the uncertain area and recorded as another cer- 
tain match. This process can create other bounded 
matches that are also removed from the uncertain 
areas and added to the certain matches. For exam- 
ple, in Figure 1, finding the certain match ih / ix  in 
disappeared in Step 2 suggests that the match to be 
made in the uncertain areas in ruins and neoclas- 
sic is ih/ ix.  The match in ruins in turn creates a
uw/ux  pairing on its left-hand side, which is also 
recorded as a certain match, eliminating this uncer- 
tain area completely. Similarly, the match in neo- 
classic yields the k /kc l  match on its right-hand side. 
This step is repeated until the number of matches 
being made levels off. 
2.4 Eva luat ion  
For the TIMIT corpus, the number of certain 
matches levels off at 123115 from 109898 initial 
matches (after six iterations of Step 3), and the 
number of remaining uncertain matches falls from 
13913 to 908. Figure 3 shows the percentage of 
phones (columns) found for every phoneme in the 
lexicon words (rows) after six iterations of match- 
ing attempts in each uncertain area. For example, 
between 12-16% of t and d are pronounced as dx. 
It  is important o note that exact phoneme/phone 
matches registered in the 1000-2000 range, while 
most of the alternative pronunciations had a fre- 
quency in the few dozen. 
Figure 3 suggests that phonemes are often mis- 
pronounced as phones in the same broad sound 
group, i.e., both the intended phonemes and the 
uttered phones are generated by the same physical 
method of production. This result is most evident 
for vowels. Some of the other types of sounds, such 
as fricatives and nasals, have not been differentiated 
so clearly. 
3 Cons ider ing  Context  
To investigate the effect of the context of a phone 
(the attributes of the phones before and after this 
phone) on its pronunciation, we examined sentences 
aligned like the sentence in Figure 1 and recorded 
phoneme/phone pairs, along with acoustic features 
for the phones that appear before and after each 
phoneme/phone pair. 3 It includes the following 
attributes: broad sound category, voiced/voiceless, 
sibilant/non-sibilant and sonorant/obstruent. Ta- 
ble 2 shows how phones are classified according to 
these acoustic features, from (Yannakoudakis and 
Hutton, 1987) and (Rabiner and Juang, 1993). 
The contexts for all the phones were fed into an 
inductive inference program by Wallace and Patrick 
(1993) in order to find functions of the context at- 
tributes (i.e., acoustic features) that are good pre- 
dictors of the phoneme intended by a speaker when 
s/he utters a particular phone. The inference pro- 
gram uses the Minimum Message Length (MML) 
principle (Georgeff and Wallace, 1984) to measure 
the significance of these functions. These functions 
are realized by a decision tree from the contexts for 
each uttered phone, with nodes splitting on the val- 
ues of particular attributes. 4 Leaf nodes in a deci- 
sion tree represent a partition of the context sample. 
Each leaf node contains a collection of contexts in 
the sample and the phoneme intended by a speaker 
for each context. An internal node of the tree is split 
on an attribute only when doing so creates astatisti- 
cally significant reduction in the number of different 
types of intended phonemes in the leaf nodes (bet- 
ter than that expected from random effects). Ideally, 
each leaf node should contain several contexts, all of 
which have the same intended phoneme. This means 
that the attributes these contexts have in common 
are sufficient o predict his intended phoneme from 
an uttered phone. 
The MML principle is based on the following 
premise: if a sender knows both the attribute val- 
ues and the class of the objects in a set, and wants 
to send the class of each object to a receiver (w.ho 
knows the attribute values but not the classes), the 
sender aims to send the shortest possible message 
(in bits). The MML criterion is used to produce the 
decision tree that can be sent by means of the short- 
est possible message. A split is made in the decision 
tree only if it decreases the message l ngth for trans- 
mitting the intended information. The decision tree 
is then sent in a two-part message: (1) instructions 
for the receiver on how to reconstruct the tree; and 
SUncertain areas were treated as a single 
phoneme/phone pair involving complicated sounds. 
4Words which are common in the corpus generate 
contexts that appear with high frequency. We assume 
that these frequencies are representative of those in En- 
glish.

(2) the labels for the classes of the objects in the 
leaves of the tree. Standard coding techniques show 
that the encoded set of labels for the classes in a 
leaf node will be short if most of the objects in that 
leaf node have the same label, and will be longer if 
the labels of the objects are equally likely. There- 
fore, if the objects in each leaf node are predomi- 
nantly of one class, then the message ncoding the 
decision tree will be shorter than a message which 
simply encodes the class label for each object in the 
set (without the tree). 
Given an uttered phone, the resulting decision tree 
shows the significant attributes and values for classi- 
fying the intended phoneme, which is the effect hat 
the surrounding sounds have on predicting the in- 
tended phoneme. 
3.1 Evaluat ion 
As indicated in Figure 3, in the majority of cases 
the uttered phone and the intended phoneme are 
the same. Table 3 summarizes the decision trees for 
situations where uttered phones are different from 
intended phonemes. This summary shows the effect 
of contextual phonetic information on the intended 
phoneme for each possible uttered phone (one line 
per phone). For example, for the uttered phone d, 
the intended phoneme was t when the next sound 
was" neither a consonant nor a vowel, i.e., a word 
boundary, a sentence boundary or missing; this oc- 
curred in 12 of the samples. Also, the intended 
phoneme was missing (i.e., d was uttered when no 
phoneme was intended) when the next sound was 
an obstruent; this happened in 2 of the samples. In 
220 samples, the uttered phone was iy with intended 
phoneme ax when iy was the last sound in a word, 
and the previous ound was a fricative. 
Some uttered phones found in Figure 3 are missing 
from Table 3 because ither there were not enough 
samples to create a tree (the stops b, g and p, the 
nasal m, and the pause), or more often because the 
trees produced had no discriminatory power. This 
occurred when each leaf node in a decision tree had 
an evenly spread mixture of intended phonemes, or 
when the same intended phoneme appeared through- 
out the tree. 
The decision trees were evaluated using test con- 
texts from 1344 sentences (out of 5040 sentences) 
spoken by 26% of the speakers. No speaker was 
in the test and training sets. Each phone and its 
context was classified into a leaf node using the at- 
tributes in the context. A phoneme prediction was 
considered correct when the intended phoneme was 
the same as the most common phoneme in the leaf 
node (determined uring training). 75% of the dif- 
ferent est samples were predicted correctly. 
4 Discussion 
We have analyzed a large corpus of sentences read 
by a large number of speakers with a view to deter- 
mining possible mis-pronunciation f phonemes and 
the context in which such mis-pronunciations occur. 
The results of our analysis support our hypotheses 
that phonemes are mis-pronounced asphones in the 
same broad sound categories, and that the context 
of mis-pronunciation provides valuable information

Tab le  3: Summary  of most  signif icant values in the decision tree for each ut tered  phone.  
Thomas, Zukerman and Raskutti 181 Extracting Phoneme Pronunciation I formation 
about the intended phoneme. 
As indicated in Figure 3, mis-pronunciation f 
affricates and fricatives is rare (over 84% certain 
matches), though when they are mis-pronounced, 
the uttered phone may be one of the stop conso- 
nants. Vowels are often mis-pronounced, but the 
uttered phone is almost always from the same broad 
sound category. The stop consonants, d and t, the 
nasal en, and the semi-vowel hh are often mis- 
pronounced. Analysis of the decision trees gen- 
erated for these mis-pronunciations i dicates that 
the attributes of the phones urrounding the mis- 
pronounced phoneme do indeed provide informa- 
tion about the intended phoneme. These decision 
trees are particularly informative for vowels owing 
to the large number of mis-pronunciations as well as 
the regularity of these mis-pronunciations. The at- 
tributes that are most useful vary for the different 
pronunciations of each phoneme. For instance, ay is 
the pronunciation for aa when the previous phone 
is nasal, while ao is pronounced for aa when the 
preceding phone is a voiced obstruent and the next 
phone is a semivowel or glide. 
The frequency of the matches in Figure 3 com- 
bined with the decision trees produced using the 
MML principle may be used to generate alternate 
pronunciations of phonemes in word models. This 
will assist in the recognition of mis-pronounced 
words during automatic speech understanding. The 
decision tree is weakest for uncommon contexts, be- 
cause of a lack of training data for constructing the 
tree (the message length for encoding phonemes in
such contexts i no better than an efficient encoding 
of the context classes using a Huffman code). In this 
case, the matrix in Figure 3 should be used to pre- 
dict alternative pronunciations. However for more 
common contexts, the decision trees are preferred, 
as they use more information than the matrix to de- 
termine the intended phoneme. 
The system described in this paper investigates 
dependencies between an intended phoneme and a 
pronounced phone, but it may be easily adapted to 
determine r lationships between an intended sound 
and a recognized sound, i.e., the output of a speech 
recognizer. Relationships determined in this man- 
ner may be used during speech recognition, and 
thus account for mis-recognition as well as mis- 
pronunciation.
