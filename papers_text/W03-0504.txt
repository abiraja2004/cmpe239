Abstract
We investigate the problem of summarizing
text documents that contain errors as a result of
optical character recognition. Each stage in the
process is tested, the error effects analyzed, and
possible solutions suggested. Our experimental
results show that current approaches, which are
developed to deal with clean text, suffer signif-
icant degradation even with slight increases in
the noise level of a document. We conclude by
proposing possible ways of improving the per-
formance of noisy document summarization.
1 Introduction
Previous work in text summarization has focused pre-
dominately on clean, well-formatted documents, i.e.,
documents that contain relatively few spelling and gram-
matical errors, such as news articles or published tech-
nical material. In this paper, we present a pilot study of
noisy document summarization, motivated primarily by
the impact of various kinds of physical degradation that
pages may endure before they are scanned and processed
using optical character recognition (OCR) software.
As more and more documents are now scanned in
by OCR, an understanding of the impact of OCR
on summarization is crucial and timely. The Mil-
lion Book Project is one of the projects that uses
OCR technology for digitizing books. Pioneered by
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, it aims to
digitize a million books by 2005, by scanning the
books and indexing their full text with OCR technology
(http://www.archive.org/texts/millionbooks.php).
Understandably, summarizing documents that contain
many errors is an extremely difficult task. In our study,
we focus on analyzing how the quality of summaries
is affected by the level of noise in the input document,
and how each stage in summarization is impacted by the
noise. Based on our analysis, we suggest possible ways of
improving the performance of automatic summarization
systems for noisy documents. We hope to use what we
have learned from this initial investigation to shed light
on future directions.
What we ascertain from studying the problem of noisy
document summarization can be useful in a number of
other applications as well. Noisy documents constitute
a significant percentage of documents we encounter in
everyday life. The output from OCR and speech recogni-
tion (ASR) systems typically contain various degrees of
errors, and even purely electronic media, such as email,
are not error-free. To summarize such documents, we
need to develop techniques to deal with noise, in addi-
tion to working on the core algorithms. Whether we can
successfully handle noise will greatly influence the final
quality of summaries of such documents.
Some researchers have studied problems relating to in-
formation extraction from noisy sources. To date, this
work has focused predominately on errors that arise dur-
ing speech recognition, and on problems somewhat dif-
ferent from summarization. For example, Gotoh and
Renals propose a finite state modeling approach to ex-
tract sentence boundary information from text and audio
sources, using both n-gram and pause duration informa-
tion (Gotoh and Renals, 2000). They found that precision
and recall of over 70% could be achieved by combining
both kinds of features. Palmer and Ostendorf describe an
approach for improving named entity extraction by ex-
plicitly modeling speech recognition errors through the
use of statistics annotated with confidence scores (Palmer
and Ostendorf, 2001). Hori and Furui summarize broad-
cast news speech by extracting words from automatic
transcripts using a word significance measure, a confi-
dence score, linguistic likelihood, and a word concatena-
tion probability (Hori and Furui, 2001).
There has been much less work, however, in the case
of noise induced by optical character recognition. Early
papers by Taghva, et al show that moderate error rates
have little impact on the effectiveness of traditional infor-
mation retrieval measures (Taghva et al, 1996a; Taghva
et al, 1996b), but this conclusion does not seem to apply
to the task of summarization. Miller, et al study the per-
formance of named entity extraction under a variety of
scenarios involving both ASR and OCR output (Miller et
al., 2000), although speech is their primary interest. They
found that by training their system on both clean and
noisy input material, performance degraded linearly as a
function of word error rates. They also note in their pa-
per: ?To our knowledge, no other information extraction
technology has been applied to OCR material? (pg. 322).
An intriguing alternative to text-based summarization
is Chen and Bloomberg?s approach to creating summaries
without the need for optical character recognition (Chen
and Bloomberg, 1998). Instead, they extract indicative
summary sentences using purely image-based techniques
and common document layout conventions. While this
is effective when the final summary is to be viewed on-
screen by the user, the issue of optical character recog-
nition must ultimately be faced in most applications of
interest (e.g., keyword-driven information retrieval).
For the work we present in this paper, we performed a
small pilot study in which we selected a set of documents
and created noisy versions of them. These were generated
both by scanning real pages via OCR and by using a fil-
ter we have developed that injects various levels of noise
into an original source document. The clean and noisy
documents were then piped through a summarization sys-
tem. We tested different modules that are often included
in such systems, including sentence boundary detection,
part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, extraction, and
editing of extracted sentences. The experimental results
show that these modules suffer significant degradation as
the noise level in the document increases. We discuss the
errors made at each stage and how they affect the quality
of final summaries.
In Section 2, we describe our experiment, including
the data creation process and various tests we performed.
In Section 3, we analyze the results of the experiment and
correlate the quality of summaries with noise levels in the
input document and the errors made at different stages of
the summarization process. We then discuss some of the
challenges in summarizing noisy documents and suggest
possible methods for improving the performance of noisy
document summarization. We conclude with future work.
2 The Experiment
2.1 Data creation
We selected a small set of four documents to study in
our experiment. Three of four documents were from the
TREC corpus and one was from a Telecommunications
corpus we collected ourselves (Jing, 2001). All are pro-
fessionally written news articles, each containing from
200 to 800 words (the shortest document was 9 sentences
and the longest was 38 sentences).
For each document, we created 10 noisy versions. The
first five corresponded to real pages that had been printed,
possibly subjected to a degradation, scanned at 300 dpi
using a UMAX Astra 1200S scanner, and then OCR?ed
with Caere OmniPage Limited Edition. These included:
clean The page as printed.
fax A faxed version of the page.
dark An excessively dark (but legible) photocopy.
light An excessively light (but legible) photocopy.
skew The clean page skewed on the scanner glass.
Note that because the faxed and photocopied documents
were processed by running them through automatic page
feeders, these pages can also exhibit noticeable skew.
The remaining five sample documents in each case were
electronic copies of the original that had had synthetic
noise (single-character deletions, insertions, and substi-
tutions) randomly injected at predetermined rates: 5%,
10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%.
In general, we want to study both real and synthetic
noise. The arguments in favor of the former are quite ob-
vious. The arguments in favor of the latter is that it is
easier to control synthetic noise effects, and often they
have exactly the same impact on the overall process as
real noise. Even though the errors may be artificial, the
impact on later processes is probably the same. For ex-
ample, changing ?nuclear? to ?nZclear? does not reflect
a common OCR error. But it does have the same effect
? changing a word in the dictionary to a word that is no
longer recognized. If the impact is identical and it is eas-
ier to control, then it is beneficial to use synthetic noise
in addition to real noise.
A summary was created for each document by human
experts. For the three documents from the TREC cor-
pus, the summaries were generated by taking a majority
opinion. Each document was given to five people who
were asked to select 20% of the original sentences as the
summary. Sentences selected by three or more of the five
human subjects were included in the summary of the doc-
ument. For the document from the Telecommunications
corpus, an abstract of the document was provided by a
staff writer from the news service. These human-created
summaries are useful in evaluating the quality of the au-
tomatic summaries.
2.2 Summarization stages
We are interested in testing how each stage of a summa-
rization system is affected by noise, and how this in turn
affects the quality of the summaries. Many summariza-
tion approaches exist, and it would be difficult to study
the effects of noise on all of them. However, the follow-
ing stages are common to many summarization systems:
? Step 1: Tokenization. The main task here is to break
the text into sentences. Tokens in the input text are
also identified.
? Step 2: Preprocessing. This typically involves part-
of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing. This step is
optional; some systems do not perform tagging and
parsing at all. Topic segmentation is deployed by
some summarization systems, but not many.
? Step 3: Extraction. This is the main step in summa-
rization, in which the automatic summarizer selects
key sentences (sometimes paragraphs or phrases) to
include in the summary.
? Step 4: Editing. Some systems post-edit the ex-
tracted sentences to make them more coherent and
concise.
For each stage, we selected one or two systems that
perform the task and tested their performance on both
clean and noisy documents.
? For tokenization, we tested two tokenizers: one is a
rule-based system that decides sentence boundaries
based on heuristic rules encoded in the program, and
the other one is a trainable tokenizer that uses a deci-
sion tree approach for detecting sentence boundaries
and has been trained on a large amount of data.
? For part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing, we
tested the English Slot Grammar (ESG) parser (Mc-
Cord, 1990). The outputs from both tokenizers were
tested on ESG. The ESG parser requires as input di-
vided sentences and returns a parse tree for each in-
put sentence, including a part-of-speech tag for each
word in the sentence. The reason we chose a full
parser such as ESG rather than a part-of-speech tag-
ger and a phrase chunking system is that the sum-
mary editing system in Step 4 uses the output from
ESG. Although many sentence extraction systems
do not use full syntactic information, it is not rare
for summarization systems that do use parsing out-
put to use a full parser, whether it is ESG or a sta-
tistical parser such as Collin?s, since such summa-
rization systems often perform operations that need
deep understanding of the original text.
? For extraction, we used a program that relies on lexi-
cal cohesion, frequency, sentence positions, and cue
phrases to identify key sentences (Jing, 2001). The
length parameter of the summaries was set to 20%
of the number of sentences in the original document.
The output from the rule-based tokenizer was used
in this step. This particular extraction system does
not use tagging and parsing.
? In the last step, we tested a cut-and-paste system that
edits extracted sentences by simulating the revision
operations often performed by professional abstrac-
tors (Jing, 2001). The outputs from all the three pre-
vious steps were used by the cut-and-paste system.
All of the summaries produced in this experiment were
generic, single-document summaries.
3 Results and Analysis
In this section, we present results at each stage of sum-
marization, analyzing the errors made and their effects
on the quality of summaries.
3.1 OCR performance
We begin by examining the overall performance of
the OCR process. Using standard edit distance tech-
niques (Esakov et al, 1994), we can compare the out-
put of OCR to the ground-truth to classify and quantify
the errors that have arisen. We then compute, on a per-
character and per-word basis, a figure for average preci-
sion (percentage of characters or words recognized that
are correct) and recall (percentage of characters or words
in the input document that are correctly recognized). As
indicated in Table 1, OCR performance varies widely de-
pending on the type of degradation. Precision values are
generally higher than recall because, in certain cases, the
OCR system failed to produce output for a portion of the
page in question. Since we are particularly interested in
punctuation due to its importance in delimiting sentence
boundaries, we tabulate a separate set of precision and
recall values for such characters. Note that these are uni-
formly lower than the other values in the table. Recall, in
particular, is a serious issue; many punctuation marks are
missed in the OCR output.

erage precision and recall).

OCR.dark 0.934 0.739 0.607 0.539 0.776 0.608

OCR.skew 0.991 0.879 0.961 0.496 0.963 0.869
3.2 Sentence boundary errors
Since most summarization systems rely on sentence ex-
traction, it is important to identify sentence boundaries
correctly. For clean text, the reported accuracy of sen-
tence boundary detection is usually above 95% (Palmer
and Hearst, 1997; Reyner and Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Riley,
1989). However, detecting sentence boundaries in noisy
documents is a serious challenge since punctuation and
capitalization, which are important features in sentence
boundary detection, are unreliable in noisy documents.
As we have just noted, punctuation errors arise frequently
in the OCR output of degraded page images.
We tested two tokenizers: one is a rule-based system
and the other is a decision tree system. The experimen-
tal results show that for the clean text, the two systems
perform almost equally well. Manual checking of the re-
sults indicates that both tokenizers made very few errors.
There should be 90 sentence boundaries in total. The de-
cision tree tokenizer correctly identified 88 of the sen-
tence boundaries and missed two (precision: 100%; re-
call: 98%). The rule-based tokenizer correctly identified
89 of the boundaries and missed one (precision: 100%;
recall: 99%). Neither system made any false positive er-
rors (i.e., they did not break sentences at non-sentence
boundaries).
For the noisy documents, however, both tokenizers
made significant numbers of errors. The types of er-
rors they made, moreover, were quite different. While
the rule-based system made many false negative errors,
the decision tree system made many false positive errors.
Therefore, the rule-based system identified far fewer sen-
tence boundaries than the truth, while the decision tree
system identified far more than the truth.
Table 2: Sentence boundary detection results: total num-
ber of sentences detected and average words per sentence
for two tokenizers. Tokenizer 1 is decision tree based,
and tokenizer 2 is rule based.

OCR.dark 70 21 46 33
OCR.fax 78 26 75 27
OCR.skew 77 23 82 21
Table 2 shows the number of sentences identified by
each tokenizer for different versions of the documents.
As we can see from the table, the noisier the documents,
the more errors the tokenizers made. This relationship
was demonstrated clearly by the results for the docu-
ments with synthetic noise. As the noise rate increases,
the number of boundaries identified by the decision tree
tokenizer gradually increases, and the number of bound-
aries identified by the rule-based tokenizer gradually de-
creases. Both numbers diverge from truth, but they err in
opposite directions.
The two tokenizers behaved less consistently on the
OCR?ed documents. For OCR.light, OCR.dark, and
OCR.fax, the decision tree tokenizer produced more sen-
tence boundaries than the rule-based tokenizer. But for
OCR.clean and OCR.skew, the decision tree tokenizer
produced fewer sentence boundaries. This may be re-
lated to the noise level in the document. OCR.clean and
OCR.skew contain fewer errors than the other noisy ver-
sions (recall Table 1). This indicates that the decision
tree tokenizer tends to identify fewer sentence boundaries
than the rule-based tokenizer for clean text or documents
with very low levels of noise, but more sentence bound-
aries when the documents have a relatively high level of
noise.
Errors made at this stage are extremely detrimental,
since they will propagate to all of the other modules in
a summarization system. When a sentence boundary is
incorrectly marked, the part-of-speech tagging and the
syntactic parsing are likely to fail. Sentence extraction
may become problematic; for example, one of the docu-
ments in our test set contains 24 sentences, but for one of
its noisy versions (OCR.dark), the rule-based tokenizer
missed most sentence boundaries and divided the docu-
ment into only three sentences, making extraction at the
sentence level difficult at best.
Since sentence boundary detection is important to
summarization, the development of robust techniques
that can handle noisy documents is worthwhile. We will
return to this point in Section 4.
3.3 Parsing errors
Some summarization systems use a part-of-speech tagger
or a syntactic parser in their preprocessing steps.
We computed the percentage of sentences that ESG
failed to return a complete parse tree, and used that value
as one way of measuring the performance of the parser on
the noisy documents. If the parser cannot return a com-
plete parse tree, then it definitely fails to analyze the sen-
tence; but even when a complete parse tree is returned,
the parse can be wrong. As we can see from Table 3, a
significant percentage of noisy sentences were not parsed.
Even for the documents with synthetic noise at a 5% rate,
around 60% of the sentences cannot be handled by the
parser. This indicates that a full parser such as ESG is
very sensitive to noise.
Even when ESG produces a complete parse tree for a
noisy sentence, the result is incorrect most of times. For
instance, the sentence ?Internet sites found that almost 90
percent collected personal information from youngsters?
was transformed to ?uInternet sites fo6ndha alQmostK0
pecent coll / 9ed pe?? after adding synthetic noise at a
25% rate. For this noisy sentence, the parser returned
a complete parse tree that marked the word ?sites? as
the main verb of the sentence, and tagged all the other
words in the sentence as nouns.1 Although a complete
parse tree is returned in this case, it is incorrect. This
explains the phenomenon that the parser returned a higher
percentage of complete parse trees for documents with
synthetic noise at the 25% rate than for documents with
lower levels of noise.
Table 3: Percentage of sentences with incomplete parse
trees. Sentence boundaries were first detected using Tok-
enizer 1 and Tokenizer 2.
Tokenizer 1 Tokenizer 2
Original 10% 5%
Snoise.05 59% 58%
Snoise.10 69% 71%
Snoise.15 66% 81%
Snoise.20 64% 66%
Snoise.25 58% 76%
OCR.clean 2% 3%
OCR.light 46% 53%
OCR.dark 37% 43%
OCR.fax 37% 30%
OCR.skew 5% 6%
The above results indicate that syntactic parsers are
very vulnerable to noise in a document. Even low lev-
els of noise lead to a significant drop in performance.
3.4 Extract quality versus noise level
In the next step, we studied how the sentence extrac-
tion module in a summarization system is affected by
noise in the input document. The sentence extractor we
used (Jing, 2001) relies on lexical links between words,
word frequency, cue phrases, and sentence positions to
identify key sentences. The performance of the system is
affected by noise in multiple dimensions: lexical links are
less reliable in a noisy condition; cue phrases are likely
to be missed due to noisy spelling; and word frequency
is less accurate due to different noisy occurrences of the
same word.
Evaluation of noisy document summaries is an inter-
esting problem. Both intrinsic evaluation and extrinsic
evaluation need to deal with noise effect on the quality
1One reason might be that the tagger is likely to tag un-
known words as nouns, and all the noisy words are considered
unknown words.
of final summaries. For intrinsic evaluation, it is de-
batable whether clean human summaries or noisy doc-
ument summaries (or both) should be used for compari-
son. There are two issues related to ?noisy? human sum-
maries: one, whether such summaries are obtainable, and
two, whether such summaries should be used in evalua-
tion. We note that it is already difficult for a human to
recover the information in the noisy documents when the
synthetic noise rate reached 10%. Therefore, noisy hu-
man summaries will not be available for documents with
relatively high level of noise. Secondly, even though the
original documents are noisy, it is desirable for the final
summaries to be fluent and clean. Therefore, if our ul-
timate goal is to produce a fluent and clean summary, it
benefits to compare the automatic summaries with such
summaries rather than noisy summaries.
We compared the noisy automatic summaries with the
clean human summaries by using three measures: uni-
gram overlap between the automatic summary and the
human-created summary, bigram overlap, and the simple
cosine. These results are shown in Table 4. The unigram
overlap is computed as the number of unique words oc-
curring both in the extract and the ideal summary for the
document, divided by the total number of unique words
in the extract. Bigram overlap is computed similarly, re-
placing words with bigrams. The simple cosine is com-
puted as the cosine of two document vectors, the weight
of each element in the vector being 1/
?
N , where N is
the total number of elements in the vector.
Not surprisingly, summaries of noisier documents gen-
erally have a lower overlap with human-created sum-
maries. However, this can be caused by either the noise
in the document or poor performance of the sentence ex-
traction system. To separate these effects and measure the
performance of sentence extraction alone, we also com-
puted the unigram overlap, bigram overlap, and cosine
between each noisy document and its corresponding orig-
inal text. These numbers are included in Table 4 in paren-
theses; they are an indication of the average noise level
in a document. For instance, the table shows that 97%
of words that occurred in OCR.clean documents also ap-
peared in the original text, while only 62% of words that
occurred in OCR.light appeared in the original. This in-
dicates that OCR.clean is less noisy than OCR.light.
3.5 Abstract generation for noisy documents
To generate more concise and coherent summaries, a
summarization system may edit extracted sentences. To
study how this step in summarization is affected by noise,
we tested a cut-and-paste system that edits extracted sen-
tences by simulating revision operations often used by
human abstractors, including the operations of removing
phrases from an extracted sentence, and combining a re-
duced sentence with other sentences (Jing, 2001). This

cosine between extracts and human-created summaries
(the numbers in parentheses are the corresponding values
between the documents and the original text).

OCR.skew 0.84 (0.97) 0.74 (0.96) 0.48 (0.93)
cut-and-paste stage relies on the results from sentence ex-
traction in the previous step, the output from ESG, and a
co-reference resolution system.
For the clean text, the cut-and-paste system performed
sentence reduction on 59% of the sentences that were ex-
tracted in the sentence extraction step, and sentence com-
bination on 17% of the extracted sentences. For the noisy
text, however, the system applied very few revision oper-
ations to the extracted (noisy) sentences. Since the cut-
and-paste system relies on the output from ESG and co-
reference resolution, which failed on most of the noisy
text, it is not surprising that it did not perform well under
these circumstances.
Editing sentences requires a deeper understanding of
the document and, as the last step in the summarization
pipeline, relies on results from all of the previous steps.
Hence, it is affected most severely by noise in the input
document.
4 Challenges in Noisy Document
Summarization
In the previous section, we have presented and analyzed
errors at each stage of summarization when applied to
noisy documents. The results show that the methods
we tested at every step are fragile, susceptible to fail-
ures and errors even with slight increases in the noise
level of a document. Clearly, much work needs to be
done to achieve acceptable performance in noisy docu-
ment summarization. We need to develop summarization
algorithms that do not suffer significant degradation when
used on noisy documents. We also need to develop robust
natural language processing techniques. For example, it
will be useful to develop a sentence boundary detection
system that can identify sentence breaks in noisy docu-
ments more reliably. One way to achieve this might be to
retrain an existing system on tokenized noisy documents
so that it will learn features that are indicative of sentence
breaks in noisy documents. However, this is only appli-
cable if the noise level in the documents is low. For doc-
ument with high level of noise, such approach will not be
effective.
In the remainder of this section, we discuss several is-
sues in noisy document summarization, identifying the
problems and proposing possible solutions. We regard
this as a first step towards a more comprehensive study
on the topic of noisy document summarization.
4.1 Choosing an appropriate granularity
It is important to choose an appropriate unit level to rep-
resent the summaries. For clean text, sentence extraction
is a feasible goal since we can reliably identify sentence
boundaries. For documents with very low levels of noise,
sentence extraction is still possible since we can probably
improve our programs to handle such documents. How-
ever, for documents with relatively high noise rates, we
believe it is better to forgo sentence extraction and instead
favor extraction of keywords or noun phrases, or gener-
ation of headline-style summaries. In our experiment,
when the synthetic noise rate reached 10% (which is rep-
resentative of what can happen when real-world docu-
ments are degraded), it was already difficult for a human
to recover the information intended to be conveyed from
the noisy documents.
Keywords, noun phrases, or headline-style summaries
are informative indications of the main topic of a doc-
ument. For documents with high noise rates, extracting
keywords or noun phrases is a more realistic and attain-
able goal than sentence extraction. Still, it may be de-
sirable to correct the noise in the extracted keywords or
phrases, either before or after summarization. There has
been past work on correcting spelling mistakes and errors
in OCR output; these techniques could be useful for this
purpose.
4.2 Using other information sources
In addition to text, target documents contain other types
of useful information that could be employed in creating
summaries. As noted previously, Chen and Bloomberg?s
image-based summarization technique avoids many of
the problems we have been discussing by exploiting doc-
ument layout features. A possible approach to summariz-
ing noisy documents, then, might be to use their method
to create an image summary and then apply OCR af-
terwards to the resulting page. We note, though, that it
seems unlikely this would lead to an improvement of the
overall OCR results, a problem which may almost cer-
tainly must be faced at some point in the process.
4.3 Assessing error rates without ground-truth
The quality of summarization is directly tied to the level
of noise in a document. In this context, it would be use-
ful to develop methods for assessing document noise lev-
els without having access to the ground-truth. Intuitively,
OCR may create errors that cause the output text to devi-
ate from ?normal? text. Therefore, one way of evaluating
OCR output, in the absence of the original ground-truth,
is to compare its features against features obtained from a
large corpus of correct text. Letter trigrams (Church and
Gale, 1991) are commonly used to correct spelling and
OCR errors (Angell et al, 1983; Kuckich, 1992; Zamora
et al, 1981), and can be applied to evaluate OCR output.
We computed trigram tables (including symbols and
punctuation marks) for 10 days of AP news articles and
evaluated the documents used in our experiment. The tri-
grams were computed on letters and Good-Turing estima-
tion is used for smoothing. The values in the table are av-
erage trigram scores for each document set. As expected,
OCR errors create rare or previously unseen trigrams that
lead to higher trigram scores in noisy documents. As in-
dicated in Table 5, the ground-truth (original) documents
have the lowest average trigram score. These scores pro-
vide a relative ranking that reflects the controlled noise
levels (Snoise.05 through Snoise.25), as well as cer-
tain of the real OCR data (OCR.clean, OCR.dark, and
OCR.light).

Trigram score
Original 2.30
Snoise.05 2.75
Snoise.10 3.13
Snoise.15 3.50
Snoise.20 3.81
Snoise.25 4.14
OCR.clean 2.60
OCR.light 3.11
OCR.dark 2.98
OCR.fax 2.55
OCR.skew 2.40
Different texts have very different baseline trigram
scores. The ranges of scores for clean and noisy text
overlap. This is because some documents contain more
instances of frequent words than others (such as ?the?),
which bring down the average scores. This issue makes
it impractical to use trigram scores in isolation to judge
OCR output.
It may be possible to identify some problems if we
scan larger units and incorporate contextual information.
For example, a window of three characters is too small
to judge whether the symbol @ is used properly: a@b
seems to be a potential OCR error, but is acceptable when
it appears in an email address such as lsa@bbb.com. In-
creasing the unit size will create sparse data problems,
however, which is already an issue for trigrams.
In the future, we plan to experiment with improved
methods for identifying problematic regions in OCR
text, including using language models and incorporat-
ing grammatical patterns. Many linguistic properties can
be identified when letter sequences are encoded in broad
classes. For example, long consonant strings are rare in
English text, while long number strings are legal. These
properties can be captured when characters are mapped
into carefully selected classes such as symbols, numbers,
upper- and lower-case letters, consonants, and vowels.
Such mappings effectively reduce complexity, allowing
us to sample longer strings to scan for abnormal patterns
without running into severe sparse data problems.
Our intention is to establish a robust index that mea-
sures whether a given section of text is ?summarizable.?
This problem is related to the general question of assess-
ing OCR output without ground-truth, but we shift the
scope of the problem to ask whether the text is summa-
rizable, rather than how many errors it may contain.
We also note that documents often contain logical
components that go beyond basic text. Pages may include
photographs and figures, program code, lists, indices, etc.
Tables, for example, can be detected, parsed, and refor-
mulated so that it becomes possible to describe their over-
all structure and even allow users to query them (Hu et
al., 2000). Developing appropriate ways of summarizing
such material is another topic of interest.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have discussed some of the challenges
in summarizing noisy documents. In particular, we broke
down the summarization process into four steps: sen-
tence boundary detection, preprocessing (part-of-speech
tagging and syntactic parsing), extraction, and editing.
We tested each step on noisy documents and analyzed
the errors that arose. We also studied how the quality of
summarization is affected by the noise level and the er-
rors made at each stage of processing.
To improve the performance of noisy document sum-
marization, we suggest extracting keywords or phrases
rather than full sentences, especially when summarizing
documents with high levels of noise. We also propose us-
ing other sources of information, such as document lay-
out cues, in combination with text when summarizing
noisy documents. In certain cases, it will be important
to be able to assess the noise level in a document; we
have begun exploring this question as well. Our plans
for the future include developing robust techniques to ad-
dress the issues we have outlined in this paper.
Lastly, we regard presentation and user interaction as a
crucial component in real-world summarization systems.
Given that noisy documents, and hence their summaries,
may contain errors, it is important to find the best ways
of displaying such information so that the user may pro-
ceed with confidence, knowing that the summary is truly
representative of the document(s) in question.
