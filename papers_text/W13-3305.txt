Abstract
The correct translation of verb tenses en-
sures that the temporal ordering of events
in the source text is maintained in the tar-
get text. This paper assesses the utility
of automatically labeling English Simple
Past verbs with a binary discursive fea-
ture, narrative vs. non-narrative, for sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) into
French. The narrativity feature, which
helps deciding which of the French past
tenses is a correct translation of the En-
glish Simple Past, can be assigned with
about 70% accuracy (F1). The narrativity
feature improves SMT by about 0.2 BLEU
points when a factored SMT system is
trained and tested on automatically labeled
English-French data. More importantly,
manual evaluation shows that verb tense
translation and verb choice are improved
by respectively 9.7% and 3.4% (absolute),
leading to an overall improvement of verb
translation of 17% (relative).
1 Introduction
The correct rendering of verbal tenses is an im-
portant aspect of translation. Translating to a
wrong verbal tense in the target language does not
convey the same meaning as the source text, for
instance by distorting the temporal order of the
events described in a text. Current statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems may have diffi-
culties in choosing the correct verb tense transla-
tions, in some language pairs, because these de-
pend on a wider-range context than SMT systems
consider. Indeed, decoding for SMT is still at
the phrase or sentence level only, thus missing
information from previously translated sentences
(which is also detrimental to lexical cohesion and
co-reference).
In this paper, we explore the merits of a dis-
course feature called narrativity in helping SMT
systems to improve their translation choices for
English verbs in the Simple Past tense (hence-
forth, SP) into one of the three possible French
past tenses. The narrativity feature characterizes
each occurrence of an SP verb, either as narrative
(for ordered events that happened in the past) or
non-narrative (for past states of affairs). Narra-
tivity is potentially relevant to EN/FR translation
because three French past tenses can potentially
translate an English Simple Past (SP), namely the
Passe? Compose? (PC), Passe? Simple (PS) or Impar-
fait (IMP). All of them can be correct translations
of an EN SP verb, depending on its narrative or
non-narrative role.
The narrativity feature can be of use to SMT
only if it can be assigned with sufficient preci-
sion over a source text by entirely automatic meth-
ods. Moreover, a narrativity-aware SMT model is
likely to make a difference with respect to base-
line SMT only if it is based on additional features
that are not captured by, e.g., a phrase-based SMT
model. In this study, we use a small amount of
manually labeled instances to train a narrativity
classifier for English texts. The (imperfect) out-
put of this classifier over the English side of a
large parallel corpus will then be used to train a
narrativity-aware SMT system. In testing mode,
the narrativity classifier provides input to the SMT
system, resulting (as we will show below) in im-
proved tense and lexical choices for verbs, and
a modest but statistically significant increase in
BLEU and TER scores. Overall, the method is
similar in substance to our previous work on the
33
combination of a classifier for discourse connec-
tives with an SMT system (Meyer and Popescu-
Belis, 2012; Meyer et al, 2012).
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 ex-
emplifies the hypothesized relation between nar-
rativity and the translations of the English Sim-
ple Past into French, along with related work on
modeling tense for MT. The automatic labeling
experiments are presented in Section 3. Exper-
iments with SMT systems are presented in Sec-
tion 4, with results from both automatic (4.3) and
manual translation scoring (4.4), followed by a
discussion of results and suggestions on improv-
ing them (Section 5).
2 English Simple Past in Translation
2.1 Role of Narrativity: an Example
The text in Figure 1 is an example taken from the
?newstest 2010? data described in Section 4 below.
In this four-sentence discourse, the English verbs,
all in Simple Past, express a series of events hav-
ing occurred in the past, which no longer affect
the present. As shown in the French translation by
a baseline SMT system (not aware of narrativity),
the English SP verbs are translated into the most
frequent tense in French, as learned from the par-
allel data the SMT was trained on.
When looking more closely, however, it ap-
pears that the Simple Past actually conveys dif-
ferent temporal and aspectual information. The
verbs offered and found describe actual events that
were ordered in time and took place subsequently,
whereas were and was describe states of general
nature, not indicating any temporal ordering.
The difference between narrative and non-
narrative uses of the English Simple Past is not al-
ways captured correctly by the baseline SMT out-
put in this example. The verbs in the first and third
sentences are correctly translated into the French
PC (one of the two tenses for past narratives in
French along with the PS). The verb in the sec-
ond sentence is also correctly rendered as IMP,
in a non-narrative use. However, the verb was in
the fourth sentence should also have been trans-
lated as an IMP, but from lack of sufficient infor-
mation, it was incorrectly translated as a PC. A
non-narrative label could have helped to find the
correct verb tense, if it would have been annotated
prior to translation.
EN: (1) After a party, I offered [Narrative] to
throw out a few glass and plastic bottles. (2) But,
on Kounicova Ulice, there were [Non-narrative]
no colored bins to be seen. (3) Luckily, on the
way to the tram, I found [Narrative] the right
place. (4) But it was [Non-narrative] overflow-
ing with garbage.
FR from BASELINE MT system: (1) Apre`s
un parti, j?ai propose? pour rejeter un peu de
verre et les bouteilles en plastique. (2) Mais, sur
Kounicova Ulice, il n?y avait pas de colored bins
a` voir. (3) Heureusement, sur la manie`re de le
tramway, j?ai trouve? la bonne place. (4) Mais il
*a e?te? de?borde?s avec des ramasseurs.

2010? data with narrativity labels and a translation
into French from a baseline SMT. The tenses gen-
erated in French are, respectively: (1) PC, (2) IMP,
(3) PC, (4) PC. The mistake on the fourth one is
explained in the text.
2.2 Modeling Past Tenses
The classical view on verb tenses that express past
tense in French (PC, PS and IMP) is that both the
PC and PS are perfective, indicating that the event
they refer to is completed and finished (Martin,
1971). Such events are thus single points in time
without internal structure. However, on the one
hand, the PC signals an accomplished event (from
the aspectual point of view) and thus conveys as
its meaning the possible consequence of the event.
The PS on the other hand is considered as aspectu-
ally unaccomplished and is used in contexts where
time progresses and events are temporally ordered,
such as narratives.
The IMP is imperfective (as its name suggests),
i.e. it indicates that the event is in its preparatory
phrase and is thus incomplete. In terms of aspect,
the IMP is unaccomplished and provides back-
ground information, for instance ongoing state of
affairs, or situations that are repeated in time, with
an internal structure.
Conversely, in English, the SP is described as
having as its main meaning the reference to past
tense, and as specific meanings the reference to
present or future tenses identified under certain
contextual conditions (Quirk et al, 1986). Cor-
blin and de Swart (2004) argue that the SP is as-
pectually ?transparent?, meaning that it applies to
34
all types of events and it preserves their aspectual
class.
The difficulty for the MT systems is thus
to choose correctly among the three above-
mentioned tenses in French, which are all valid
possibilities of translating the English SP. When
MT systems fail to generate the correct tense in
French, several levels of incorrectness may oc-
cur, exemplified in Figure 2 with sentences taken
from the data used in this paper (see Section 3 and
Grisot and Cartoni (2012)).
1. In certain contexts, tenses may be quite inter-
changeable, which is the unproblematic case
for machine translation, depending also on
the evaluation measure. In Example 1 from
Figure 2, the verb e?taient conside?re?es (were
seen) in IMP has a focus on temporal length
which is preserved even if the translated tense
is a PC (ont e?te? conside?re?es, i.e. have been
seen) thanks to the adverb toujours (always)).
2. In other contexts, the tense proposed by the
MT system can sound strange but remains ac-
ceptable. For instance, in Example 2, there
is a focus on temporal length with the IMP
translation (voyait, viewed) but this meaning
is not preserved if a PC is used (a vu, has
viewed) though it can be recovered by the
reader.
3. The tense output by an MT system may be
grammatically wrong. In Example 3, the PC
a renouvele? (has renewed) cannot replace the
IMP renouvelaient (renewed) because of the
conflict with the imperfective meaning con-
veyed by the adverbial sans cesse (again and
again).
4. Finally, a wrong tense in the MT output can
be misleading, if it does not convey the mean-
ing of the source text but remains unnoticed
by the reader. In Example 4, using the PC
a e?te? leads to the interpretation that the per-
son was no longer involved when he died,
whereas using IMP e?tait implies that he was
still involved, which may trigger very differ-
ent expectations in the mind of the reader
(e.g. on the possible cause of the death, or its
importance to the peace process).

of change, he has never achieved domestic political legiti-
macy, and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions.

2.3 Verb Tenses in SMT
Modeling verb tenses for SMT has only recently
been addressed. For Chinese/English translation,
Gong et al (2012) built an n-gram-like sequence
model that passes information from previously
translated main verbs onto the next verb so that
its tense can be more correctly rendered. Tense is
morphologically not marked in Chinese, unlike in
English, where the verbs forms are modified ac-
cording to tense (among other factors). With such
a model, the authors improved translation by up to
0.8 BLEU points.
Conversely, in view of English/Chinese trans-
lation but without implementing an actual trans-
lation system, Ye et al (2007) used a classifier
to generate and insert appropriate Chinese aspect
markers that in certain contexts have to follow the
Chinese verbs but are not present in the English
source texts.
For translation from English to German, Gojun
and Fraser (2012) reordered verbs in the English
source to positions where they normally occur in
35
German, which usually amounts to a long-distance
movement towards the end of clauses. Reordering
was implemented as rules on syntax trees and im-
proved the translation by up to 0.61 BLEU points.
In this paper, as SMT training needs a large
amount of data, we use an automatic classifier to
tag instances of English SP verbs with narrativity
labels. The labels output by this classifier are then
modeled when training the SMT system.
3 Automatic Labeling of Narrativity
3.1 Data
A training set of 458 and a test set of 118 English
SP verbs that were manually annotated with narra-
tivity labels (narrative or non-narrative) was pro-
vided by Grisot and Cartoni (2012) (see their ar-
ticle for more details about the data). The train-
ing set consists of 230 narrative and 228 non-
narrative instances, the test set has 75 narrative in-
stances and 43 non-narrative ones. The sentences
come from parallel EN/FR corpora of four dif-
ferent genres: literature, news, parliamentary de-
bates and legislation. For each instance, the En-
glish sentence with the SP verb that must be clas-
sified, as well as the previous and following sen-
tences, had been given to two human annotators,
who assigned a narrative or non-narrative label. To
avoid interference with the translation into French,
which could have provided clues about the label,
the translations were not shown to annotators1.
Annotators agreed over only 71% of the in-
stances, corresponding to a kappa value of only
0.44. As this is at the lower end of the accept-
able spectrum for discourse annotation (Carletta,
1996), one of the important questions we ask in
this paper is: what can be achieved with this qual-
ity of human annotation, in terms of an automatic
narrativity classifier (intrinsic performance) and of
its use for improving verb translation by SMT (ex-
trinsic evaluation)? It must be noted that instances
on which the two annotators had disagreed were
resolved (to either narrative or non-narrative) by
looking at the French human translation (an ac-
ceptable method given that our purpose here is
translation into French), thus increasing the qual-
ity of the annotation.
1The goal was to focus on the narrativity property, regard-
less of its translation. However, annotations were adjudicated
also by looking at the FR translation. For a different ap-
proach, considering exclusively the tense in translation, see
the discussion in Section 5.

sifiers on narrativity. We report recall, precision,

3.2 Features for Narrativity
The manually annotated instances were used for
training and testing a Maximum Entropy classi-
fier using the Stanford Classifier package (Man-
ning and Klein, 2003). We extracted the following
features from the sentence containing the verb to
classify and the preceding sentence as well, thus
modeling a wider context than the one modeled by
phrase-based SMT systems. For each verb form,
we considered its POS tag and syntactical cate-
gory, including parents up to the first verbal phrase
(VP) parent node, as generated by Charniak and
Johnson?s constituent parser (2005). This parser
also assigns special tags to auxiliary (AUX) and
modal verbs (MD), which we include in the fea-
tures.
We further used a TimeML parser, the Tarsqi
Toolkit (Verhagen et al, 2005; Verhagen and
Pustejovsky, 2008), which automatically outputs
an XML-like structure of the sentence, with a hy-
pothesis on the temporal ordering of the events
mentioned. From this structure we extract event
markers such as PAST-OCCURRENCE and aspec-
tual information such as STATE.
Temporal ordering is often also signaled by
other markers such as adverbials (e.g., three weeks
before). We manually gathered a list of 66 such
temporal markers and assigned them, as an addi-
tional feature, a label indicating whether they sig-
nal synchrony (e.g., meanwhile, at the same time)
or asynchrony (e.g., before, after).
3.3 Results of Narrativity Labeling
With the above features, we obtained the classi-
fication performance indicated in Table 1. The
MaxEnt classifier reached 0.71 F1 score, which is
similar to the human annotator?s agreement level.
Moreover, the kappa value for inter-class agree-
ment was 0.43 between the classifier and the hu-
man annotation, a value which is also close to the
kappa value for the two human annotators. In a
sense, the classifier thus reaches the highest scores
36
that are still meaningful, i.e. those of inter-coder
agreement. As a baseline for comparison, the ma-
jority class in the test set (the ?narrative? label)
would account for 63.56% of correctly classified
instances, whereas the classifier correctly labeled
72.88% of all test instances.
For further comparison we built a CRF
model (Lafferty et al, 2001) in order to label nar-
rativity in sequence of other tags, such as POS.
The CRF uses as features the two preceding POS
tags to label the next POS tag in a sequence of
words. The same training set of 458 sentences
as used above was POS-tagged using the Stan-
ford POS tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003), with the
left3words-distsim model. We replaced
the instances of ?VBD? (the POS tag for SP verbs)
with the narrativity labels from the manual annota-
tion. The same procedure was then applied to the
118 sentences of the test set on which CRF was
evaluated.
Overall, the CRF model only labeled narrativity
correctly at an F1 score of 0.36, while kappa had
a negative value signaling a weak inverse correla-
tion. Therefore, it appears that the temporal and
semantic features used for the MaxEnt classifier
are useful and account for the much higher per-
formance of MaxEnt, which is used in the SMT
experiments described below.
We further evaluate the MaxEnt classifier by
providing in Table 2 the confusion matrix of the
automatically obtained narrativity labels over the
test set. Labeling non-narrative uses is slightly
more prone to errors (32.6% error rate) than nar-
rative ones (24% errors), likely due to the larger
number of narratives vs. non-narratives in the
training and the test data.

4 SMT with Narrativity Labels
4.1 Method
Two methods to use labels conveying to SMT in-
formation about narrativity were explored (though
more exist). First, as in our initial studies ap-
plied to discourse connectives, the narrativity la-
bels were simply concatenated with the SP verb
form in EN (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012) ?
see Example 2 in Figure 3. Second, we used
factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang,
2007), which allow for any linguistic annotation
to be considered as additional weighted feature
vectors, as in our later studies with connectives
(Meyer et al, 2012). These factors are log-linearly
combined with the basic features of phrase-based
SMT models (phrase translation, lexical and lan-
guage model probabilities).
To assess the performance gain of narrativity-
augmented systems, we built three different SMT
systems, with the following names and configura-
tions:
? BASELINE: plain text, no verbal labels.
? TAGGED: plain text, all SP verb forms con-
catenated with a narrativity label.
? FACTORED: all SP verbs have narrativity
labels as source-side translation factors (all
other words labeled ?null?).
1. BASELINE SMT: on wednesday the c?ssd de-
clared the approval of next year?s budget to be a
success. the people?s party was also satisfied.
2. TAGGED SMT: on wednesday the c?ssd
declared-Narrative the approval of next year?s
budget to be a success. the people?s party was-
Non-narrative also satisfied.
3. FACTORED SMT: on wednesday the c?ssd
declared|Narrative the approval of next year?s
budget to be a success. the people?s party
was|Non-narrative also satisfied.
Figure 3: Example input sentence from ?newstest
2010? data for three translation models: (1) plain
text; (2) concatenated narrativity labels; (3) narra-
tivity as translation factors (the ?|null? factors on
other words were omitted for readability).
Figure 3 shows an example input sentence for
these configurations. For the FACTORED SMT
model, both the EN source word and the factor
37
information are used to generate the FR surface
target word forms. The tagged or factored annota-
tions are respectively used for the training, tuning
and test data as well.
For labeling the SMT data, no manual annota-
tion is used. In a first step, the actual EN SP verbs
to be labeled are identified using the Stanford POS
tagger, which assigns a ?VBD? tag to each SP verb.
These tags are replaced, after feature extraction
and execution of the MaxEnt classifier, by the nar-
rativity labels output by the latter. Of course, the
POS tagger and (especially) our narrativity clas-
sifier may generate erroneous labels which in the
end lead to translation errors. The challenge is
thus to test the improvement of SMT with respect
to the baseline, in spite of the noisy training and
test data.
4.2 Data
In all experiments, we made use of parallel En-
glish/French training, tuning and testing data from
the translation task of the Workshop on Machine
Translation (www.statmt.org/wmt12/).
? For training, we used Europarl v6 (Koehn,
2005), original EN2 to translated FR
(321,577 sentences), with 66,143 instances
of SP verbs labeled automatically: 30,452
are narrative and 35,691 are non-narrative.
? For tuning, we used the ?newstest 2011? tun-
ing set (3,003 sentences), with 1,401 auto-
matically labeled SP verbs, of which 807 are
narrative and 594 non-narrative.
? For testing, we used the ?newstest 2010? data
(2,489 sentences), with 1,156 automatically
labeled SP verbs (621 narrative and 535 non-
narrative).
We built a 5-gram language model with SRILM
(Stolcke et al, 2011) over the entire FR part of Eu-
roparl. Tuning was performed by Minimum Error
Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003). All transla-
tion models were phrase-based using either plain
text (possibly with concatenated labels) or fac-
tored training as implemented in the Moses SMT
toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007).
2We only considered texts that were originally authored
in English, not translated into it from French or a third-party
language, to ensure only proper tenses uses are observed. The
relevance of this constraint is discussed for connectives by
Cartoni et al (2011).
4.3 Results: Automatic Evaluation
In order to obtain reliable automatic evaluation
scores, we executed three runs of MERT tuning for
each type of translation model. With MERT being
a randomized, non-deterministic optimization pro-
cess, each run leads to different feature weights
and, as a consequence, to different BLEU scores
when translating unseen data.
Table 3 shows the average BLEU and TER
scores on the ?newstest 2010? data for the three
systems. The scores are averages over the three
tuning runs, with resampling of the test set,
both provided in the evaluation tool by Clark
et al (2011) (www.github.com/jhclark/
multeval). BLEU is computed using jBLEU
V0.1.1 (an exact reimplementation of NIST?s
?mteval-v13.pl? script without tokenization). The
Translation Error Rate (TER) is computed with
version 0.8.0 of the software (Snover et al, 2006).
A t-test was used to compute p values that indicate
the significance of differences in scores.
Translation model BLEU TER
BASELINE 21.4 61.9
TAGGED 21.3 61.8
FACTORED 21.6* 61.7*
Table 3: Average values of BLEU (the higher the
better) and TER (the lower the better) over three
tuning runs for each model on ?newstest 2010?.
The starred values are significantly better (p <
0.05) than the baseline.
In terms of overall BLEU and TER scores, the
FACTORED model improves performance over the
BASELINE by +0.2 BLEU and -0.2 TER (as lower
is better), and these differences are statistically
significant at the 95% level. On the contrary,
the concatenated-label model (noted TAGGED)
slightly decreases the global translation perfor-
mance compared to the BASELINE. A similar
behavior was observed when using labeled con-
nectives in combination with SMT (Meyer et al,
2012).
The lower scores of the TAGGED model may
be due to the scarcity of data (by a factor of 0.5)
when verb word-forms are altered by concatenat-
ing them with the narrativity labels. The small
improvement by the FACTORED model of over-
all scores (such as BLEU) is also related to the
scarcity of SP verbs: although their translation is
38
improved, as we will now show, the translation of
all other words is not changed by our method, so
only a small fraction of the words in the test data
are changed.
4.4 Results: Human Evaluation
To assess the improvement specifically due to the
narrativity labels, we manually evaluated the FR
translations by the FACTORED model for the 207
first SP verbs in the test set against the transla-
tions from the BASELINE model. As the TAGGED
model did not result in good scores, we did not fur-
ther consider it for evaluation. Manual scoring was
performed along the following criteria for each oc-
currence of an SP verb, by bilingual judges look-
ing both at the source sentence and its reference
translation.
? Is the narrativity label correct? (?correct? or
?incorrect?) ? this is a direct evaluation of the
narrativity classifier from Section 3
? Is the verb tense of the FACTORED model
more accurate than the BASELINE one?
(noted ?+? if improved, ?=? if similar, ??? if
degraded)
? Is the lexical choice of the FACTORED model
more accurate than the BASELINE one, re-
gardless of the tense? (again noted ?+? or ?=?
or ???)
? Is the BASELINE translation of the verb
phrase globally correct? (?correct? or ?incor-
rect?)
? Is the FACTORED translation of the verb
phrase globally correct? (?correct? or ?incor-
rect?)
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the counts and per-
centages of improvements and/or degradations of
translation quality with the systems FACTORED
and BASELINE. The correctness of the labels, as
evaluated by the human judges on SMT test data,
is similar to the values given in Section 3 when
evaluated against the test sentences of the narra-
tivity classifier. As shown in Table 4, the narrativ-
ity information clearly helps the FACTORED sys-
tem to generate more accurate French verb tenses
in almost 10% of the cases, and also helps to find
more accurate vocabulary for verbs in 3.4% of the
cases. Overall, as shown in Table 5, the FAC-
TORED model yields more correct translations of
the verb phrases than the BASELINE in 9% of the
cases ? a small but non-negligible improvement.

rectness of 207 translations of EN SP verbs into

correct translations than the BASELINE one.
An example from the test data shown in Fig-
ure 4 illustrates the improved verb translation. The
BASELINE system translates the SP verb looked
incorrectly into the verb conside?rer (consider), in
wrong number and its past participle only (con-
side?re?s, plural). The FACTORED model generates
the correct tense and number (IMP, semblait, sin-
gular) and the better verb sembler (look, appear).
This example is scored as follows: the labeling is
correct (?yes?), the tense was improved (?+?), the
lexical choice was improved too (?+?), the BASE-
LINE was incorrect while the FACTORED model
was correct.
5 Discussion and Future Work
When looking in detail through the translations
that were degraded by the FACTORED model,
some were due to the POS tagging used to find
the EN SP verbs to label. For verb phrases made
of an auxiliary verb in SP and a past participle
(e.g. was born), the POS tagger outputs was/VBD
born/VBN. As a consequence, our classifier only
considers was, as non-narrative, although was

EN: tawa hallae looked|Non-narrative like
many other carnivorous dinosaurs.
FR BASELINE: tawa hallae *conside?re?s
comme de nombreuses autres carnivores di-
nosaures.
FR FACTORED: tawa hallae semblait comme
de nombreux autres carnivores dinosaures.

born as a whole is a narrative event. This can
then result in wrong FR tense translations. For
instance, the fragment nelson mandela was|Non-
narrative born on . . . is translated as: nelson man-
dela *e?tait ne? en . . . , which in FR is pluperfect
tense instead of the correct Passe? Compose? est ne?
as in the reference translation. A method to con-
catenate such verb phrases to avoid such errors is
under work.
A further reason for the small improvements in
translation quality might be that factored transla-
tion models still operate on rather local context,
even when the narrativity information is present.
To widen the context captured by the translation
model, labeling entire verbal phrase nodes in hi-
erarchical or tree-based syntactical models will be
considered in the future. Moreover, it has been
shown that it is difficult to choose the optimal pa-
rameters for a factored translation model (Tam-
chyna and Bojar, 2013).
In an alternative approach currently under work,
a more direct way to label verb tense is imple-
mented, where a classifier can make use of the
same features as those extracted here (in Sec-
tion 3.2), but its classes are those that directly
indicate which target verb tense should be out-
put by the SMT. Thus, not only SP verbs can
be considered and no intermediate category such
as narrativity (that is more difficult to learn) is
needed. The classifier will predict which FR tense
should be used depending on the context of the
EN verbs, for which the FR tense label can be
annotated as above, within a factored translation
model. Through word alignment and POS tag-
ging, this method has the additional advantage of
providing much more training data, extracted from
word alignment of the verb phrases, and can be
applied to all tenses, not only SP. Moreover, the
approach is likely to learn which verbs are prefer-
ably translated with which tense: for instance, the
verb started is much more likely to become a com-
mence? (PC) in FR than to commenc?ait (IMP), due
to its meaning of a punctual event in time, rather
than a continuous or repetitive one.
6 Conclusion
The paper presented a method to automatically la-
bel English verbs in Simple Past tense with a bi-
nary pragmatic feature, narrativity, which helps
to distinguish temporally ordered events that hap-
pened in the past (?narrative?) from past states of
affairs (?non-narrative?). A small amount of man-
ually annotated data, combined with the extraction
of temporal semantic features, allowed us to train a
classifier that reached 70% correctly classified in-
stances. The classifier was used to automatically
label the English SP verbs in a large parallel train-
ing corpus for SMT systems. When implement-
ing the labels in a factored SMT model, translation
into French of the English SP verbs was improved
by about 10%, accompanied by a statistically sig-
nificant gain of +0.2 BLEU points for the overall
quality score. In the future, we will improve the
processing of verb phrases, and study a classifier
with labels that are directly based on the target lan-
guage tenses.
