Integer Linear Programming in NLP - Constrained Conditional Models
Ming-Wei Chang, Nicholas Rizzolo, Dan Roth
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
 
Making decisions in natural language processing problems often involves assigning 
values to sets of interdependent variables where the expressive dependency structure 
can influence, or even dictate, what assignments are possible. Structured learning 
problems such as semantic role labeling provide one such example, but the setting is 
broader and includes a range of problems such as name entity and relation recognition 
and co-reference resolution. The setting is also appropriate for cases that may require a 
solution to make use of multiple (possible pre-designed or pre-learned components) as 
in summarization, textual entailment and question answering. In all these cases, it is 
natural to formulate the decision problem as a constrained optimization problem, with an 
objective function that is composed of learned models, subject to domain or problem 
specific constraints. 
Constrained Conditional Models (aka Integer Linear Programming formulation of NLP 
problems) is a learning and inference framework that augments the learning of 
conditional (probabilistic or discriminative) models with declarative constraints (written, 
for example, using a first-order representation) as a way to support decisions in an 
expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and 
inference. In most applications of this framework in NLP, following [Roth & Yih, 
CoNLL?04], Integer Linear Programming (ILP) was used as the inference framework, 
although other algorithms can be used for that purpose.  
This framework, with and without Integer Linear Programming as its inference engine, 
has recently attracted much attention within the NLP community, with multiple papers in 
all the recent major conferences, and a related workshop in NAACL?09. Formulating 
problems as constrained optimization problems over the output of learned models has 
several advantages. It allows one to focus on the modeling of problems by providing the 
opportunity to incorporate problem specific global constraints using a first order 
language ? thus frees the developer from (much of the) low level feature engineering ? 
and it guarantees exact inference. It provides also the freedom of decoupling the stage 
of model generation (learning) from that of the constrained inference stage, often 
resulting in simplifying the learning stage as well as the engineering problem of building 
an NLP system, while improving the quality of the solutions.
These advantages and the availability of off-the-shelf solvers have led to a large variety 
of natural language processing tasks being formulated within framework, including 
semantic role labeling, syntactic parsing, coreference resolution, summarization, 
transliteration and joint information extraction. 
The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the framework of Constrained Conditional Models 
(CCMs) to the broader ACL community, motivate it as a generic framework for learning 
and inference in global NLP decision problems, present some of the key theoretical and 
9
practical issues involved in using CCMs and survey some of the existing applications of 
it as a way to promote further development of the framework and additional 
applications. The tutorial will thus be useful for many of the senior and junior 
researchers that have interest in global decision problems in NLP, providing a concise 
overview of recent perspectives and research results. 
Tutorial Outline 
After shortly motivating and introducing the general framework, the main part of the 
tutorial is a methodological presentation of some of the key computational issues 
studied within CCMs that we will present by looking at case studies published in the 
NLP literature. In the last part of the tutorial, we will discuss engineering issues that 
arise in using CCMs and present some tool that facilitate developing CCM models.  
1. Motivation and Task Definition [30 min] 
We will motivate the framework of Constrained Conditional Models and exemplify it 
using the example of Semantic Role Labeling.  
2. Examples of Existing Applications [30 min] 
We will present in details several applications that made use of CCMs ? including 
coreference resolution, sentence compression and information extraction and use these 
to explain several of the key advantages the framework offers. We will discuss in this 
context several ways in which constraints can be introduced to an application.
3. Training Paradigms [30 min] 
The objective function used by CCMs can be decomposed and learned in several ways, 
ranging from a complete joint training of the model along with the constraints to a 
complete decoupling between the learning and the inference stage. We will present the 
advantages and disadvantages offered by different training paradigms and provide 
theoretical and experimental understanding. In this part we will also discuss comparison 
to other approaches studied in the literature. 
4. Inference methods and Constraints [30 min] 
We will present and discuss several possibilities for modeling inference in CCMs, from 
Integer Linear Programming to search techniques. We will also discuss the use of hard 
constraints and soft constraints and present ways for modeling constraints.  
5. Introducing background knowledge via CCMs [30 min]  
We will look at ways in which Constrained Conditional Models (CCMs)can be used to 
augment probabilistic models with declarative constraints in order to support decisions 
10
in an expressive output space, and how declarative constraints can be used to aid 
supervised and semi-supervised training. 
 
6. Developing CCMs Applications [30 min] 
We present a modeling language that facilitates developing applications within the CCM 
framework and present some ?templates? for possible applications.
