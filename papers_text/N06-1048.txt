Abstract
The TREC Definition and Relationship
questions are evaluated on the basis of in-
formation nuggets that may be contained
in system responses. Human evalua-
tors provide informal descriptions of each
nugget, and judgements (assignments of
nuggets to responses) for each response
submitted by participants. While human
evaluation is the most accurate way to
compare systems, approximate automatic
evaluation becomes critical during system
development.
We present Nuggeteer, a new automatic
evaluation tool for nugget-based tasks.
Like the first such tool, Pourpre, Nugge-
teer uses words in common between can-
didate answer and answer key to approx-
imate human judgements. Unlike Pour-
pre, but like human assessors, Nuggeteer
creates a judgement for each candidate-
nugget pair, and can use existing judge-
ments instead of guessing. This cre-
ates a more readily interpretable aggregate
score, and allows developers to track in-
dividual nuggets through the variants of
their system. Nuggeteer is quantitatively
comparable in performance to Pourpre,
and provides qualitatively better feedback
to developers.
1 Introduction
The TREC Definition and Relationship questions
are evaluated on the basis of information nuggets,
abstract pieces of knowledge that, taken together,
comprise an answer. Nuggets are described infor-
mally, with abbreviations, misspellings, etc., and
each is associated with an importance judgement:
?vital? or ?okay?.1 In some sense, nuggets are like
WordNet synsets, and their descriptions are like
glosses. Responses may contain more than one
nugget?when they contain more than one piece of
knowledge from the answer. The median scores of
today?s systems are frequently zero; most responses
contain no nuggets (Voorhees, 2005).
Human assessors decide what nuggets make up an
answer based on some initial research and on pools
of top system responses for each question. Answer
keys list, for each nugget, its id, importance, and
description; two example answer keys are shown
in Figures 1 and 2. Assessors make binary deci-
sions about each response, whether it contains each
nugget. When multiple responses contain a nugget,
the assessor gives credit only to the (subjectively)
best response.
Using the judgements of the assessors, the fi-
nal score combines the recall of the available vi-
tal nuggets, and the length (discounting whitespace)
of the system response as a proxy for precision.
Nuggets valued ?okay? contribute to precision by in-
creasing the length allowance, but do not contribute
to recall. The scoring formula is shown in Figure 3.

Automatic evaluation of systems is highly desir-
able. Developers need to know whether one sys-
tem performs better or worse than another. Ideally,
they would like to know which nuggets were lost or
gained. Because there is no exhaustive list of snip-
pets from the document collection that contain each
nugget, an exact automatic solution is out of reach.
Manual evaluation of system responses is too time
consuming to be effective for a development cycle.
The Qaviar system first described an approximate
automatic evaluation technique using keywords, and
Pourpre was the first publicly available implemen-
tation for these nugget-based tasks. (Breck et al,
2000; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005). Pourpre
calculates an idf - or count-based, stemmed, unigram
similarity between each nugget description and each
tinction between ?vital? and ?okay?.
376
candidate system response. If this similarity passes a
threshold, then it uses this similarity to assign a par-
tial value for recall and a partial length allowance,
reflecting the uncertainty of the automatic judge-
ment. Importantly, it yields a ranking of systems
very similar to the official ranking (See Table 2).
Nuggeteer offers three important improvements:
? interpretability of the scores, as compared to
official scores,
? use of known judgements for exact information
about some responses, and
? information about individual nuggets, for de-
tailed error analysis.
Nuggeteer makes scores interpretable by making
binary decisions about each nugget and each system
response, just as assessors do, and then calculating
the final score in the usual way. We will show that
Nuggeteer?s absolute error is comparable to human
error, and that the 95% confidence intervals Nugge-
teer reports are correct around 95% of the time.
Nuggeteer assumes that if a system response was
ever judged by a human assessor to contain a partic-
ular nugget, then other identical responses also con-
tain that nugget. When this is not true among the hu-
man judgements, we claim it is due to annotator er-
ror. This assumption allows developers to add their
own judgements and have the responses they?ve ad-
judicated scored ?exactly? by Nuggeteer.
These features empower developers to track not
only the numeric value of a change to their system,
but also its effect on retrieval of each nugget.
2 Approach
Nuggeteer builds one binary classifier per nugget for
each question, based on n-grams (up to trigrams)
in the description and optionally in any provided
judgement files. The classifiers use a weight for
each n-gram, an informativeness measure for each
n-gram, and a threshold for accepting a response as
bearing the nugget.
2.1 N -gram weight
The idf -based weight for an n-gram w1...wn is the
sum of unigram idf counts from the AQUAINT
corpus of English newspaper text, the corpus from
which responses for the TREC tasks are drawn. We
did not explore using n-gram idfs. A tf component
is not meaningful because the data are so sparse.
2.2 Informativeness
Let G be the set of nuggets for some question. Infor-
mativeness of an n-gram for a nugget g is calculated
based on how many other nuggets in that question
(? G) contain the n-gram. Let
i(g, w1...wn) =
{ 1 if count(g, w1..wn) > 0
0 otherwise
(1)
where count(g, w1...wn) is the number of occur-
rences of the n-gram in responses containing the
nugget g.
Then informativeness is:
I(g, w1...wn) = 1 ?
?
g??G i(g?, w1...wn)
|G| (2)
This captures the Bayesian intuition that the more
outcomes a piece of evidence is associated with, the
less confidence we can have in predicting the out-
come based on that evidence.
2.3 Judgement
Nuggeteer does not guess on responses which have
been judged by a human to contain a nugget, or those
which have unambiguously judged not to, but as-
signs the known judgement.2
For unseen responses, we determine the n-gram
recall for each nugget g and candidate response
w1...wl by breaking the candidate into n-grams and
finding the sum of scores:
Recall(g, w1...wl) = (3)
n?1?
k=0
l?k?
i=0
W (g, wi...wi+k) ? I(g, wi...wi+k)
The candidate is considered to contain all nuggets
whose recall exceeds some threshold. Put another
2If a response was submitted, and no response from the same
system was judged to contain a nugget, then the response is con-
sidered to not contain the nugget. We normalized whitespace
and case for matching previously seen responses.
377
way, we build an n-gram language model for each
nugget, and assign those nuggets whose predicted
likelihood exceeds a threshold.
When several responses contain a nugget, Nugge-
teer picks the first (instead of the best, as assessors
can) for purposes of scoring.
2.4 Parameter Estimation
We explored a number of parameters in the scor-
ing function: stemming, n-gram size, idf weights
vs. count weights, and the effect of removing stop-
words. We tested all 24 combinations, and for each
experiment, we cross-validated by leaving out one
submitted system, or where possible, one submitting
institution (to avoid training and testing on poten-
tially very similar systems).3
Each experiment was performed using a range
of thresholds for Equation 3 above, and we se-
lected the best performing threshold for each data
set.4 Because the threshold was selected after cross-
validation, it is exposed to overtraining. We used a
single global threshold to minimize this risk, but we
have no reason to think that the thresholds for differ-
ent nuggets are related.
Selecting thresholds as part of the training process
can maximize accuracy while eliminating overtrain-
ing. We therefore explored Bayesian models for au-
tomatic threshold selection. We model assignment
of nuggets to responses as caused by the scores ac-
cording to a noisy threshold function, with separate
false positive and false negative error rates. We var-
ied thresholds and error rates by entire dataset, by
question, or by individual nugget, evaluating them
using Bayesian model selection.
3 The Data
For our experiments, we used the definition ques-
tions from TREC2003, the ?other? questions from
TREC2004 and TREC2005, and the relation-
ship questions from TREC2005. (Voorhees, 2003;
Voorhees, 2004; Voorhees, 2005) The distribution
of nuggets and questions is shown for each data set
in Table 1. The number of nuggets by number of

submitting institution. For TREC2005 we did not run the non-
anonymized data in time for this submission. In the TREC2005
Relationship task, RUN-1 was withdrawn.

system responses assigned that nugget (difficulty of
nuggets, in a sense) is shown in Figure 4. More than
a quarter of relationship nuggets were not found by
any system. Among all data sets, many nuggets were
found in none or just a few responses.
4 Results
We report correlation (R2), and Kendall?s ?b, follow-
ing Lin and Demner-Fushman. Nuggeteer?s scores
are in the same range as real system scores, so we
also report average root mean squared error from the
official results. We ?corrected? the official judge-
ments by assigning a nugget to a response if that
response was judged to contain that nugget in any
assessment for any system.

mance with Pourpre optimal thresholds for TREC
definition questions, as reproduced in Table 2.
Nuggeteer?s results are shown in the last column.5
Table 3 shows a comparison of Pourpre and
Nuggeteer?s correlations with official scores. As ex-
5We report only micro-averaged results, because we wish to
emphasize the interpretability of Nuggeteer scores. While the
correlations of macro-averaged scores with official scores may
be higher (as seems to be the case for Pourpre), the actual val-
ues of the micro-averaged scores are more interpretable because
they include a variance.

Error (?mse) between scores generated by Pour-

tings as the ? comparison above.
pected from the Kendall?s ? comparisons, Pourpre?s
correlation is about the same or higher in 2003, but
fares progressively worse in the subsequent tasks.
To ensure that Pourpre scores correlated suf-
ficiently with official scores, Lin and Demner-
Fushman used the difference in official score be-
tween runs whose ranks Pourpre had swapped, and
showed that the majority of swaps were between
runs whose official scores were less than the 0.1
apart, a threshold for assessor agreement reported
in (Voorhees, 2003).
Nuggeteer scores are not only correlated with,
but actually meant to approximate, the assessment
scores; thus we can use a stronger evaluation: root
mean squared error of Nuggeteer scores against of-
ficial scores. This estimates the average difference
between the Nuggeteer score and the official score,
and at 0.077, the estimate is below the 0.1 thresh-
old. This evaluation is meant to show that the
scores are ?good enough? for experimental evalua-
tion, and in Section 4.4 we will substantiate Lin and
Demner-Fushman?s observation that higher correla-
tion scores may reflect overtraining rather than ac-
tual improvement.
Accordingly, rather than reporting the best
Nuggeteer scores (Kendall?s ? and R2) above, we
follow Pourpre?s lead in reporting a single variant
(no stemming, bigrams) that performs well across
the data sets. As with Pourpre?s evaluation, the par-

ted against Nuggeteer scores (idf term weighting,
no stemming, bigrams) for each data set (all F-
measures have ? = 3), with the Nuggeteer 95%

datasets, 6 systems (3%) have an official score out-
side Nuggeteer?s 95% confidence interval.
ticular thresholds for each year are experimentally
optimized. A scatter plot of Nuggeteer performance
on the definition tasks is shown in Figure 5.
4.2 N -gram size and stemming
A hypothesis advanced with Pourpre is that bigrams,
trigrams, and longer n-grams will primarily account
for the fluency of an answer, rather than its semantic
content, and thus not aid the scoring process. We
included the option to use longer n-grams within
Nuggeteer, and have found that using bigrams can
yield very slightly better results than using uni-
grams. From inspection, bigrams sometimes capture
named entity and grammatical order features.
Experiments with Pourpre showed that stemming
hurt slightly at peak performances. Nuggeteer has
the same tendency at all n-gram sizes.
Figure 6 compares Kendall?s ? over the possi-
ble thresholds, n-gram lengths, and stemming. The
choice of threshold matters by far the most.
4.3 Term weighting and stopwords
Removing stopwords or giving unit weight to all
terms rather than an idf -based weight made no sub-
stantial difference in Nuggeteer?s performance.

grams, bigrams, or trigrams averaged over the three
years of definition data using F (? = 3).

Table 4: The probabilities of the data given several
models: a baseline coin, three models of different
granularity with globally specified false positive and
negative error rates, and a model with too many pa-
rameters, where even the error rates have per-nugget
granularity. We select the most probable model, the
per-nugget threshold model.
4.4 Thresholds
We experimented with Bayesian models for auto-
matic threshold selection. In the models, a system
response contains or does not contain each nugget
as a function of the response?s Nuggeteer score plus
noise. Table 4 shows that, as expected, the best mod-
els do not make assumptions about thresholds be-
ing equal within a question or dataset. It is interest-
ing to note that Bayesian inference catches the over-
parametrization of the model where error rates vary
per-nugget as well. In essence, we do not need those
additional parameters to explain the variation in the
data.
The ? of the best selection of parameters on the
2003 data set using the model with one threshold per
380
nugget and global errors is 0.837 (?mse=0.037).
We have indeed overtrained the best threshold for
this dataset (compare ?=0.879, ?mse=0.067 in Ta-
bles 2 and 3), suggesting that the numeric differ-
ences in Kendall?s Tau shown between the Nugge-
teer, Pourpre, and Rouge systems are not indicative
of true performance. The Bayesian model promises
settings free of overtraining, and thus more accurate
judgements in terms of?mse and individual nugget
classification accuracy.
4.5 Training on System Responses
Intuitively, if a fact is expressed by a system re-
sponse, then another response with similar n-grams
may also contain the same fact. To test this intuition,
we tried expanding our judgement method (Equa-
tion 3) to select the maximum judgement score from
among those of the nugget description and each of
the system responses judged to contain that nugget.
Unfortunately, the assessors did not mark which
portion of a response expresses a nugget, so we also
find spurious similarity, as shown in Figure 7. The fi-
nal results are not conclusively better or worse over-
all, and the process is far more expensive.
We are currently exploring the same extension for
multiple ?nugget descriptions? generated by manu-
ally selecting the appropriate portions of system re-
sponses containing each nugget.
4.6 Judgment Precision and Recall
Because Nuggeteer makes a nugget classification
for each system response, we can report precision
and recall on the nugget assignments. Table 5
shows Nuggeteer?s agreement rate with assessors on
whether each response contains a nugget. 6
4.7 Novel Judgements
Approximate evaluation will tend to undervalue new
results, simply because they may not have keyword
overlap with existing nugget descriptions. We are
therefore creating tools to help developers manually
assess their system outputs.
As a proof of concept, we ran Nuggeteer on the
best 2005 ?other? system (not giving Nuggeteer
6Unlike human assessors, Nuggeteer is not able to pick the
?best? response containing a nugget if multiple responses have
it, and will instead pick the first, so these values are artifactually
low. However, 2005 results may be high because these results
reflect anonymized runs.

the official judgements), and manualy corrected its
guesses.7 Assessment took about 6 hours, and our
judgements had precision of 78% and recall of 90%,
for F-measure 0.803? 0.065 (compare Table 5). The
official score of .299 was still within the confidence
interval, but now on the high side rather than the
low (.257? .07), because we found the answers quite
good. In fact, we were often tempted to add new
nuggets! We later learned that it was a manual run,
produced by a student at the University of Maryland.
5 Discussion
Pourpre pioneered automatic nugget-based assess-
ment for definition questions, and thus enabled a
rapid experimental cycle of system development.
Nuggeteer improves on that functionality, and crit-
ically adds:
? an interpretable score, comparable to official
scores, with near-human error rates,
? a reliable confidence interval on the estimated
score,
? scoring known responses exactly,
? support for improving the accuracy of the score
through additional annotation, and
? a more robust training process
We have shown that Nuggeteer evaluates the def-
inition and relationship tasks with comparable rank
swap rates to Pourpre. We explored the effects of
stemming, term weighting, n-gram size, stopword
removal, and use of system responses for training,
all with little effect. We showed that previous meth-
ods of selecting a threshold overtrained, and have
7We used a low threshold to make the task mostly correcting
and less searching. This is clearly not how assessors should
work, but is expedient for developers.

briefly described a promising way to select finer-
grained thresholds automatically.
Our experiences in using judgements of system
responses point to the need for a better annotation
of nugget content. It is possible to give Nuggeteer
multiple nugget descriptions for each nugget. Man-
ually extracting the relevant portions of correctly-
judged system responses may not be an overly ardu-
ous task, and may offer higher accuracy. It would be
ideal if the community?including the assessors?
were able to create and promulgate a gold-standard
set of nugget descriptions for previous years.
Nuggeteer currently supports evaluation for the
TREC definition, ?other?, and relationship tasks, for
the AQUAINT opinion pilot 8, and is under devel-
opment for the DARPA GALE task 9.
