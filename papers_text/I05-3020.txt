Abstract 
This paper describes a Chinese word 
segmentor (CWS) based on backward 
maximum matching (BMM) technique 
for the 2nd Chinese Word Segmenta-
tion Bakeoff in the Microsoft Research 
(MSR) closed testing track. Our CWS 
comprises of a context-based Chinese 
unknown word identifier (UWI). All 
the context-based knowledge for the 
UWI is fully automatically generated 
by the MSR training corpus. Accord-
ing to the scored results of the MSR 
closed testing track and our analysis, it 
shows that our BMM-based CWS with 
the context-based UWI is a simple and 
effective system to achieve high Chi-
nese word segmentation performance 
of more than 95.5% F-measure. 
1 Introduction 
In the research fields of Chinese natural lan-
guage processing (NLP), a high-performance 
Chinese word segmentor (CWS) is a useful pre-
processing stage to produce an intermediate re-
sult for later processes, such as search engines, 
text mining and speech recognition, etc. The 
bottleneck of developing a high-performance 
CWS is to comprise of a high-performance Chi-
nese UWI (Lin et al 1993; Tsai et al 2003). It is 
because Chinese is written without any separa-
tion between words and meanwhile more than 
50% words of the Chinese texts in web corpus 
are out-of-vocabulary (Tsai et al 2003). 
Conventionally, there are four approaches to 
develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach 
(Cheng et al 1999), especial forward and back-
ward maximum matching (Wong  and Chan, 
1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntax-
semantic knowledge (Chen et al 2002); (3) Sta-
tistical approach based on statistical language 
model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et 
al. 2000; Gao et al 2003); and (4) Hybrid ap-
proach trying to combine the benefits of diction-
ary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches 
(Tsai et al 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003). In prac-
tice, statistical approaches are most widely used 
because their effective and reasonable perform-
ance. For a CWS, there are two types of word 
segmentation ambiguities while there are no un-
known words in them: (1) Overlap ambiguity
(OA), take a character string ABC as an exam-
ple. If its segmentation can be either AB/C or 
A/BC depending on different context, the ABC 
is called an overlap ambiguity string (OAS), 
such as ???(a general)/?(use)? and ??(to 
get)/??(for military use)? (the symbol ?/? in-
dicates a word boundary); (2) Combination 
ambiguity (CA), take a character string AB as 
an example. If its segmentation can be either 
A/B or AB depending on different context, the 
AB is called a combination ambiguity string 
(CAS), such as ??(just)/?(can)? and ???
(ability).? Meantime, there are two types of error 
segmentation caused by unknown word problem: 
(1) Lack of unknown word (LUW), it means 
the error segmentation occurred by lack of an 
unknown word in the system dictionary, such as 
??/?/???; (2) Error identified word (EIW), 
it means the error segmentation occurred by an 
error identified unknown words, such as ???
142
?.? To sum up, for a CWS in most case the 
UWI is a pre-processing stage to detect un-
known words for the optimization of LUW-EIW 
tradeoff, and then to disambiguate those auto-
detected OAS and CAS problems from the seg-
mentation results. 
The goal of this paper is to illustrate and re-
port the effectiveness and the scored results of 
our BMM-based CWS for the second Interna-
tional Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff in 
the MSR closed (MSR_C) track. For this Bake-
off, our CWS is mainly addressed on optimizing 
the LUW-EIW tradeoff. 
The remainder of this paper is arranged as 
follows. In Section 2, we present the details of 
our BMM-based CWS comprised of a context-
based UWI. In Section 3, we present the scored 
results of the CWS in the MSR_C track and give 
our analysis. Finally, in Section 4, we give our 
conclusions and suggest some future research 
directions. 
2 Development of BMM-based CWS 
As per (Tsai et al 2004), the Chinese word seg-
mentation performance of BMM technique is 
about 1% greater than that of FMM technique. 
Thus, we adopt BMM technique as base to de-
velop our CWS. The descriptions of symbols 
used in our CWS are given as below: 
<BOS>: begin of sentence; 
<EOS>: end of sentence; 
<BOW>: begin of word; 
<EOW>: end of word; 
/: word boundary; 
+: inner word boundaries of the segmentation of 
a system word segmented by BMM tech-
nique with the system dictionary exclusive 
of this system word; 
SWS (stop word string): for a system word  
(such as ??(of)?), if the ratio (non-SWS 
probability) of total frequency of the other 
system words including it (such as ???
(beautiful)?) and its character string fre-
quency is less than or equal to 1%, it is a 
SWS; 
SWBS (stop word bigram string): for a word 
bigram (such as ??(just)/?(can)?), if the 
ratio (non-SWBS probability) of its charac-
ter string (such as ??? (ability)? fre-
quency and its character string frequency is 
less than or equal to 1%, it is a SWBS; 
BMM-ASM (BMM ambiguity string mapping 
table: the BMM-ASM table lists all the 
pairs of correct SS (given in training corpus) 
and the error BMM SS (generated by BMM 
with the training system dictionary). Take 
the Chinese sentence ?????? as an ex-
ample. As per its MSR-standard segmenta-
tion ???(effect)/?(really)/?(good)? and 
its BMM segmentation ?? (follow)/??
(indeed)/?(good),? the pair  ???/??-
??/??? is a BMM-ASM; 
TCT (triple context template): a TCT comprised 
of three items from left to right are: the left 
word, the segmented system word and the 
right word, where the system word is not a 
mono-syllabic Chinese word. Take the Chi-
nese sentence ???/?/?? as an example. 
The two generated TCT are: 
?<BOS>/?+1-char-word/??
 ?<BOS>/1-char-word+?/??; and 
WCT (word context template): a WCT com-
prised of three items from left to right are: 
?<BOW>?, the segmented system word and 
?<EOW>?, where the system word is not a 
mono-syllabic word. Take the system word 
????(lamasery)? as an example. Its two 
WCT are: 
 ?<BOW>/??+1-char-word/<EOW>? 
  ?<BOW>/2-char-word+?/<EOW>.? 
The algorithm of our BMM-based CWS com-
prised of a context-based UWI is as below: 
Step 1. Generate BMM segmentation for the 
input Chinese sentence with system dictionary, 
firstly. The system dictionary comprised of all 
word types found in the training corpus. Then, 
use BMM-ASM table to revise the matched 
BMM ambiguity string. 
Step 2. Use UWI to identify unknown words 
from the segmentation of Step 1 by the TCT 
knowledge, firstly. For the matched TCT, the 
characters between the left word and the right 
word will be combined as an UWI-identified 
word. If the UWI-identified word includes a 
SWS or a SWBS, it will be not an UWI-
identified word. Then, use the system diction-
ary of Step 1 inclusive of the UWI-identified 
words of this step to repeat Step 1 process. 
Step 3. Add tags ?<BOW>? and ?<EOW>? at 
143
the left-side and right-side of the continue 1-
char character segmentations of Step 2, firstly. 
Then, use UWI to identify unknown words by 
the WCT knowledge. If the number of charac-
ters between ?<BOW>? and ?EOW>? is same 
with that of the matched WCT, these 1-char 
characters will be combined as an UWI-
identified word. If the UWI-identified word 
includes a SWS or a SWBS, it will be not an 
UWI-identified word. Finally, use the system 
dictionary of Step 2 inclusive of those UWI-
identified words of this step to repeat Step 1 
process. 
Step 4. Use UWI to combine a word bigram 
into a word by the following two conditions: 
(1) if the non-SWS probability of the right 
first character of the left-side word is greater 
or equal to 99% and (2) if the non-SWS prob-
ability of the left first character of the right-
side word is greater or equal to 99%. Take the 
word bigram ???? /?? as an example. 
Since the non-SWS probability of the right 
first character ??? of the left-side word ??
??? is 99.95%, ?????? is identified as 
an UWI-identified word. If the UWI-identified 
word includes a SWS or a SWBS, it will be 
not an UWI-identified word. Finally, use the 
system dictionary of Step 3 inclusive of those 
UWI-identified words of this step to repeat the 
Step 1 process. 
Step 5. Repeat the Step 2 process. 
Step 6. Repeat the Step 3 process. 
Step 7. Repeat the Step 4 process. 
Step 8. Stop. 
In the above algorithm, Steps 2, 3 and 4 re-
peated at Steps 5, 6 and 7, respectively, are de-
signed to show the recursive effect of our CWS. 
3 The Scored Results and Analysis 
In the 2nd Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, 
there are four training corpus: AS (Academia 
Sinica) and CU (City University of Hong Kong) 
are traditional Chinese corpus, PU (Peking Uni-
versity) and Microsoft Research (MSR) are sim-
plified Chinese corpus. Meanwhile, there are 
two testing tracks of this bakeoff: closed and 
open. We attend MSR_C track. The non-SWS 
and the non-SWBS probabilities of our CWS for 
this bakeoff are all set to 1%. And, the segmen-
tation results of each step of our CWS are col-
lected and scored, respectively. 
3.1 The Scored Results 
Table 1 shows the details of MSR training and 
testing corpus. Note that, in Table 1, the details 
of MSR testing corpus were computed by us 
according to the MSR gold testing corpus. From 
Table 1, it indicates that the MSR testing track 
seems to be a 25-folds experiment design. 
Table 1. The details of MSR_C corpus

Character types 5,167  2,839 
Characters 4,050,469 184,356
Table 2 shows the scored results of our CWS 
in MSR_C track. The performance of ?Step 
1(P)? in Table 2 was computed by us and the 
others were from the scored results. It shows a 
very high performance of 99.1% F-measure can 
be achieved while the BMM-based CWS by us-
ing a system dictionary comprised of word types 
found in the MSR training and testing corpus at 
Step 1 (?P? means ?Perfect?).

3.2 The Analysis 
Table 3 (see next page) shows the differences of 
F-measure and ROOV between each near-by step 
of our CWS. From Table 3, it indicates that the 
most contribution for increasing the overall per-
formance (F-measure) of our CWS is at Step 3, 
which uses WCT knowledge. 
Table 4 (see next page) shows the distribu-
tions of four segmentation error types (OAS, 
CAS, LUW and EIW) for each step of our CWS. 
From Table 4, it shows that our context-based 
UWI with the knowledge of TCT and WCT can 
144
effectively to optimize the LUW-EIW tradeoff. 
Moreover, from Table 4, it also shows that the 
knowledge of SWS, SWBS and BMM-ASM can 
effectively to resolve the CAS errors.

4 Conclusions and Future Directions 
In this paper, we have applied a BMM-based 
CWS comprised of a context-based UWI to the 
Chinese word segmentation and obtained a high 
performance of 95.5% F-measure in the MSR 
closed track. To sum up the results of this study, 
we have following conclusions and future direc-
tions: 
(1)Since the F-measure of Step 1 of our CWS is 
94.3%, it indicates that the BMM with BMM-
ASM knowledge is a simple but probably ef-
fective technique as a good base in developing 
a high performance CWS; 
(2)Since 82% of segmentation errors of our 
CWS caused by LUW problem, this result 
supports that a high performance CWS is re-
lied on a high performance Chinese UWI. 
(3)For a CWS, there are two critical and proba-
bly independent tasks: the optimization of 
LUW-EIW tradeoff and the detection and dis-
ambiguation of OAS and CAS error segmen-
tation. We believe the former task is more 
critical than the later one. 
(4)We will continue to expand our CWS with 
other linguistic knowledge (such as part-of-
speech information and morphology) and 
BTM model (Tsai 2005) to improve our 
BMM-based CWS for attending the third In-
ternational Chinese Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff in both closed and open testing tracks.
