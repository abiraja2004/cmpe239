Abstract
The mapping from phonetic categories to
acoustic cue values is highly flexible, and
adapts rapidly in response to exposure. There
is currently, however, no theoretical frame-
work which captures the range of this adap-
tation. We develop a novel approach to mod-
eling phonetic adaptation via a belief-updating
model, and demonstrate that this model natu-
rally unifies two adaptation phenomena tradi-
tionally considered to be distinct.
1 Introduction
In order to understand speech, people map a contin-
uous, acoustic signal onto discrete, linguistic cate-
gories, such as words. Despite a long history of re-
search, no invariant mapping from acoustic features
to underlying linguistic units has yet been found.
Some of this lack of invariance is due to random
factors, such as errors in production and percep-
tion, but much is due to systematic factors, such as
differences between speakers, dialects/accents, and
speech conditions.
The human speech perception system appears to
deal with the lack of invariance in two ways: by stor-
ing separate, speaker-, group-, or context-specific
representations of the same categories (Goldinger,
1998), and by rapidly adapting phonetic categories
to acoustic input. Even though a person?s inven-
tory of native language phonetic categories is gen-
erally fixed from an early age (Werker and Tees,
1984), the mapping between these categories and
their acoustic realizations is flexible. Listeners adapt
rapidly to foreign-accented speech (Bradlow and
Bent, 2008) and acoustically distorted speech (Davis
et al, 2005), showing increased comprehension af-
ter little exposure. Such adaptation results in tem-
porary and perhaps speaker-specific changes in pho-
netic categorization (Norris et al, 2003; Vroomen et
al., 2007; Kraljic and Samuel, 2007).
To our knowledge, there is no theoretical frame-
work which explains the range and specific pat-
terns of adaptation of phonetic categories. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for under-
standing phonetic category adaptation?rational be-
lief updating?and develop a computational model
within this framework which straightforwardly ex-
plains two types of phonetic category adaptation
which are traditionally considered to be separate.
While phonetic category adaptation has not thus
far been described in this way, it nevertheless shows
many hallmarks of rational inference under uncer-
tainty (Jacobs and Kruschke, 2010). When there is
another possible explanation for strange pronunci-
ations (e.g. the speaker has a pen in her mouth),
listeners do not show any adaptation (Kraljic et
al., 2008). Listeners are more willing to gener-
alize features of a foreign accent to new talkers
if they were exposed to multiple talkers initially,
rather than a single talker (Bradlow and Bent, 2008).
Listeners also show rational patterns of generaliza-
tions of perceptual learning for specific phonetic
contrasts, generalizing to new speakers only when
the adapted phonetic categories of the old and new
speakers share similar acoustic cue values (Kraljic
and Samuel, 2007).
While it is not conclusive, the available evidence
suggests that listeners update their beliefs about pho-

netic categories based on experience in a rational
way. We propose that Bayesian belief updating
can provide a principled computational framework
for understanding rapid adaptation of phonetic cate-
gories as optimal inference under uncertainty. Such
a framework has the appeal of being successfully ap-
plied in other domains (Brenner et al, 2000; Fine
et al, 2010). In addition, rational models have also
been used within the domain of speech perception to
model acquisition of phonetic categories (Vallabha
et al, 2007; Feldman et al, 2009a; McMurray et al,
2009), the perceptual magnet effect (Feldman et al,
2009b), and how various cues to the same phonetic
contrast can be combined (Toscano and McMurray,
2010).
2 The Phenomena: Perceptual
recalibration and selective adaptation
The flexibility of phonetic categories has been
demonstrated through studies which manipulate the
distribution of acoustic cues associated with a par-
ticular category. These studies take advantage of
the natural variability of acoustic cues. Take, for
example, the consonants /b/ and /d/. These two
consonants can be distinguished largely on the ba-
sis of the trajectory of the second formant before
and after closure (Iskarous et al, 2010). Like all
acoustic-phonetic cues, there is natural variability in
the F2 locus for productions of each category (de-
picted schematically in Figure 1, left). Listeners re-
act to subtle changes in the distributions of acous-
tic cues, and adjust their phonetic categories for a
variety of contrasts and manipulations (Kraljic and
Samuel, 2006). In this paper, we model the effects
of the two most common types of manipulation stud-
ied thus far, which produce opposite changes in pho-
netic classification.
The first of these is repeated exposure to acousti-
cally ambiguous tokens, which results in a change in
classification termed ?perceptual learning? (Norris
et al, 2003) or ?perceptual recalibration? (Bertelson
et al, 2003) in which the initially-ambiguous token
becomes an accepted example of one phonetic cate-
gory. Such ambiguous cue values are not uncommon
because of the natural variability in normal speech.
It is thus possible to generate a synthetic production
/?/ which is acoustically intermediate between /b/
and /d/, and which is phonetically ambiguous in the
absence of other cues but nevertheless sounds like a
plausible production. When paired with another cue
which implies /b/, subjects reliably classify /?/ as
/b/. Disambiguating information could be provided
by a video of a talker producing /b/ (Vroomen et al,
2007), or a word such as a?out, where a /b/ has been
replaced with /?/ (Norris et al, 2003). When /?/ is
repeatedly paired in this way with information bias-
ing a /b/ interpretation, subjects begin to interpret
/?/ as /b/ in general, classifying more items on a
/b/-to-/d/ continuum as /b/ (Figure 1, center-right,
red curve).
A second manipulation is repeated exposure to
the same, acoustically unambiguous token. Re-
peated exposure to /b/ causes ?selective adaptation?
of this category, where listeners are less likely to
11
classify items as /b/, indicated by a shift in the /b/-
/d/ classification boundary towards /b/ (Figure 1,
far-right).
Traditionally, recalibration and selective adapta-
tion have been analyzed as separate processes,
driven by separate underlying mechanisms
(Vroomen et al, 2004), since they arise under
different circumstances and produce opposite
effects on classification. They also show different
time courses. Vroomen et al (2007) found that,
on the one hand, strong recalibration effects occur
after just a few exposures to ambiguous tokens, but
fade with further exposure (Figure 3, upper curve).
On the other, selective adaptation is present after a
few exposures to unambiguous tokens, but grows
steadily stronger with further exposure (Figure 3,
lower curve).
We will show that these two superficially differ-
ent adaptation phenomena are actually closely re-
lated, and will provide a unified account by appeal-
ing to principles of Bayesian belief updating. These
principles are used to construct two models. The
first, a unimodal model, treats phonetic categories
as distributions over acoustic cue dimensions. The
second, a multimodal model, treats phonetic cate-
gories as distributions over phonetic cue dimensions,
which integrate information from both audio and vi-
sual cues. Both models capture the general effect
directions of selective adaptation and recalibration,
but only the multimodal model captures their dis-
tinct time courses.
The next section provides a high-level descrip-
tions of these models, and how they might describe
the selective adaptation and recalibration data of
Vroomen et al (2007). Section 4 describes this data
and the methods used to collect it in more details.
Section 5 describes the general modeling frame-
work, how it was fit to the data, and the results, and
Section 6 describes the multimodal model and its fit
to the data.
3 Phonetic category adaptation via belief
updating
In our proposed framework, the listener?s classifica-
tion behavior can be viewed as arising from their be-
liefs about the distribution of acoustic cues for each
phonetic category. Specifically, as we will develop

Figure 2: An incremental belief-updating model for pho-
netic recalibration and selective adaptation. These distri-
butions correspond to the classification functions in Fig-
ure 1. Left: ambiguous stimuli labeled as /b/ cause a
shift of the /b/ category towards those stimuli. Right:
repeated unambiguous stimuli correspond to a narrower
distribution than expected.
more rigorously below, the probability of classify-
ing a given token x (which is the value of either an
acoustic cue or a multimodal, phonetic cue) as /b/
is proportional to the relative likelihood of the cue
value x arising from /b/ (relative to the overall like-
lihood of observing tokens like x, regardless of cat-
egory). Thus, changes in the listener?s beliefs about
the distribution of cue values of category /b/ will re-
sult in changes in their willingness to classify tokens
as /b/.
A belief-updating model accounts for recalibra-
tion and selective adaptation in the following way.
When, on the one hand, a listener encounters many
tokens that they consider to be /b/ but which are all
acoustically intermediate between /b/ and /d/, they
will change their beliefs about the distribution of
/b/, shifting it to better align with these ambiguous
cue values (Figure 2, left). This results in increased
categorization of items on a /b/-to-/d/ continuum
as /b/, since the range on the continuum over which
the likelihood associated with /b/ is higher than that
of /d/ is extended.
On the other hand, when a listener encounters
repeated, tightly-clustered and highly prototypical
/b/ productions, they update their beliefs about the
distribution of /b/ to reflect that /b/ productions
are more precise than they previously believed (Fig-
ure 2, right). They consequently assign lower likeli-
hood to intermediate, ambiguous cue values for /b/,
causing them to classify fewer /b/-/d/ continuum
items as /b/.

is straightforward: the more observations are made,
the narrower the distribution becomes, and the more
the classification boundary shifts towards the adapt-
ing category. However, modeling the time course
of recalibration, as measured by Vroomen et al
(2007), is more complicated. Recalibration comes
on quickly, but fades gradually with many expo-
sures (Figure 3). As discussed below in Section 5.3,
the unimodal model cannot account for this pattern,
because it consideres the acoustically-similar expo-
sure and test stimuli the same. The multimodal
model, by integrating audio and visual cues to form
the adapting percept, dissociates the adapting stim-
ulus from the test stimuli and does not suffer from
this problem. It is thus in principle capable of re-
producing the empirical time course of recalibration
observed by Vroomen et al (2007). In practice, this
model does indeed provide a good qualitative fit to
human data, as discussed in Section 6.
4 Behavioral data: Vroomen et al (2007)
Vroomen et al (2007) investigated the time course
of adaptation to audio-visual speech stimuli. In each
block, subjects were repeatedly exposed to a sin-
gle type of stimulus. The visual stimulus was either
/aba/ or /ada/, and the audio stimulus was either an
unambiguous match of the visual stimulus or was an
ambiguous production. Throughout exposure, sub-
jects were tested with unimodal acoustic test stimuli
in order to measure the effect of exposure thus far.

tion.
The overall effect of exposure to unambiguous stim-
uli was computed by comparing classification be-
tween unambiguous-/b/ and unambiguous-/d/ ex-
posure, and likewise for the effect of exposure to
ambiguous stimuli.
The acoustic stimuli used in exposure and test
were drawn from a nine-item continuum (denoted
x = 1, . . . , 9) from /aba/ to /ada/, formed by ma-
nipulating the second formant frequency before and
after the stop consonant (Vroomen et al, 2004). The
most /aba/-like item x = 1 was synthesized us-
ing the formant values from a normal /aba/ pro-
duction, and the most /ada/-like item x = 9 was
derived from an /ada/ production. The maximally
ambiguous item was determined for each subject via
a labeling function (percent-/aba/ classification for
each token) derived from pre-test classification data
(98 trials from across the entire continuum). All
subjects? maximally ambiguous tokens were one of
x = 4, 5 or 6.
Each exposure block consisted of 256 repetitions
of the bimodal exposure stimulus. After 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 exposure trials subjects
completed a test block, of six classification trials.
They were asked to classify as /aba/ or /ada/ the
three most ambiguous stimuli from the continuum
(the most ambiguous stimulus and the two neigh-
boring stimuli) twice each. For each ambiguity con-
dition, the aggregate effect of exposure across cat-
egories was a difference score, calculated by sub-
tracting the percent /aba/-classification after /d/-
exposure from the percent after /b/-exposure. This
/b/-/d/ difference score, as a function of cumulative
exposure trials, is plotted in Figure 3.

5 The unimodal model
We implemented an incremental belief-updating
model using a mixture of Gaussians as the underly-
ing model of phonetic categories (Figure 4), where
each phonetic category j = 1 . . .M corresponds to
a normal distribution over percepts x with mean ?j
and precision (inverse-variance) ?j (e.g. Figure 1,
left).
p(xi | ci) = N (?ci , ?ci) (1)
The listener?s beliefs about phonetic categories
are captured by additionally assigning probability
distributions to the means ?j and precisions ?j
of each phonetic category. The prior distribution
p(?j , ?j) represents the listener?s beliefs before ex-
posure to the experimental stimuli, and the posterior
p(?j , ?j |X) captures the listener?s beliefs after ex-
posure to stimuli X from category j. These two dis-
tributions are related via Bayes? Rule:
p(?j , ?j |X) ? p(X |?j , ?j)p(?j , ?j) (2)
In order to quantitatively evaluate such a model,
the form of the prior distributions needs to be spec-
ified. A natural prior to use in this case is known as
a Normal-Gamma prior.1 This prior factorizes the
joint prior into
p(?j , ?j) = p(?j |?j)p(?j)
p(?j |?j) = N (?0j , ??j)
p(?j) = G(?, ?)
where N (?0j , ??j) is a Normal distribution with
mean ?0j and precision ??j , and G(?, ?) is a Gamma
distribution with shape ? and rate ? (Figure 4).
5.1 Identifying individual subjects? prior
beliefs
In order to pick the most ambiguous token for each
subject, Vroomen et al (2007) collected calibration
data from their subjects, which consisted of 98 two-
alternative forced choice trials on acoustic tokens
spanning the entire /aba/-to-/ada/ continuum. As
1It is natural in that the Normal-Gamma distribution is the
conjugate prior for a Gaussian distribution where there is some
uncertainty about both the mean and the precision. Using the
conjugate prior ensures that the posterior distribution has the
same form as the prior.
revealed by this pre-test data, each subject?s pho-
netic categories are different, and so we chose to es-
timate the prior beliefs about the nature of the expo-
sure categories on a subject-by-subject basis. We fit
each subject?s classification function using logistic
regression. The logistic function is closely related
to the distribution over category labels given obser-
vations in a mixture of Gaussians model. Specifi-
cally, when there are only two categories (as in our
case), the probability that an observation at x will be
labeled c1 is2
p(c1 |x) =
p(x | c1)p(c1)
p(x | c1)p(c1) + p(x | c2)p(c2)
(3)
Further assuming that the categories have equal pre-
cision ? and equal prior probability p(c1) = p(c2) =
0.53, this reduces to a logistic function of the form
p(c1 |x) = (1 + exp(?gx+ b))?1, where
g = (?1 ? ?2)? and b = (?21 ? ?22)?
Even when b and g can be estimated from the sub-
ject?s pre-test data, one additional degree of freedom
needs to be fixed, and we chose to fix the distance
between the means, ?1??2. Given these values, the
values for (?1 + ?2)/2 (the middle of the subject?s
continuum) and ? can be calculated using
?1 + ?2
2 =
b
g and ? =
g
?1 ? ?2
(4)
We chose to use ?1 ? ?2 = 8, the length of the
acoustic continuum, which stretches from x = 1
(derived from a natural /aba/) to x = 9 (from a nat-
ural /ada/). This is roughly equivalent to assuming
that all subjects would accept these tokens as good
productions of /aba/ and /ada/, which indeed they
do (Vroomen et al, 2004).
So far, we have accounted for the expected val-
ues of category means and precisions. The strength
of these prior beliefs, however, has yet to be speci-
fied, and unfortunately there is no way to estimate
this based on the pre-test data of Vroomen et al
(2007). The model parameters corresponding to the
2Here we are abusing notation a bit by using c1 as a short-
hand for c = 1.
3This assumption is not strictly necessary, but for this pre-
liminary model we chose to make it in order to keep the model
as simple as possible.
14
subject?s confidence in their prior beliefs are ? and
? for the means and variances, respectively. Given
the specific form of the prior we use here, these two
parameters are closely related to the number of ob-
servations that are required to modify the subject?s
belief about a phonetic category (Murphy, 2007).
5.2 Model fitting
In order to evaluate the performance of this model
relative to human subjects, four simulations were
run per subject, corresponding to the four condi-
tions used by Vroomen et al (2007): ambiguous /d/
and /b/, and unambiguous /d/ and /b/. For each
subject, the hyper-parameters (?0j , ?, ?, ?) were set
according to the methods described above: values
were chosen for the free parameters ? and ?, and ?
and ?0j were set based on the subject?s pre-test data.
To model the effect of n exposure trials in a given
condition, the stimuli used by Vroomen et al (2007)
were input into the model in the following way. For
ambiguous blocks, the observations X were n repe-
titions of that subject?s most ambiguous token, and
for unambiguous blocks they were n repetitions of
the x = 1 for /b/ or x = 9 for /d/. For /b/ ex-
posure blocks, the category labels C were set to 1,
and for /d/ they were set to 2, corresponding to the
disambiguating effect of the visual cues.
For each subject, condition, and number of expo-
sures, the posterior distribution over category means
and precisions p(?j , ?j |X,C) was sampled using
numerical MCMC techniques.4
To compare the simulation results with the test
data of Vroomen et al (2007), it was neces-
sary to find the classification function, p(ctest =
1 |xtest, X), which is the probability that acoustic
test stimulus xtest will be categorized as /b/ (ctest =
1) given the training dataX . Based on (3), it suffices
to find the predictive distributions
p(xtest | ctest = 1, X)
=
??
p(xtest |?1, ?1)p(?1, ?1 |X)d?1d?1
and, analogously, p(xtest | ctest = 2, X). These in-

each individual pair of means and variances drawn
from the posterior p(?j , ?j |X).
Once this labeling function is obtained, the de-
pendent measure used by Vroomen et al (2007)?
average percentage categorized as /b/?can be
calculated, by averaging the value of p(ctest =
1 |xtest, X) for the test stimuli xtest used by
Vroomen et al (2007). These were the subject?s
maximally ambiguous stimulus (x = 4, 5 or 6, de-
pending on the subject), and its two neighbors on the
continuum. The difference score used by Vroomen
et al (2007) was computed by subtracting the aver-
age probability of /b/ classification after /b/ (c = 1)
exposure from the probability of /b/ classification
after /d/ (c = 2) exposure. The best fitting con-
fidence parameters ? and ? were those which mini-
mized mean squared error between the empirical and
model difference scores.

Figure 6: When audio and visual cues are integrated before categorization, a small number of ambiguous tokens still
produces a shift in the category mean, and thus recalibration (left, bright red). However, a large number of ambiguous
tokens produces both a shift of the category mean and an increase in precision (center-right, dark blue). If the audio-
visual percept is located away from the maximally ambiguous middle region of the continuum, this can result in an
extinction of the initial recalibration effect with increasing exposure (far right).
5.3 Results
Figure 5, top panel shows the results of the unimodal
model. While this model clearly captures the direc-
tion of the effects caused by ambiguous and unam-
biguous exposure, it fails to account for a significant
qualitative feature of the human data: the rise and
then fall of the recalibration effect (red line).
The reason for this is that the audio component
of the audio-visual exposure stimuli is identical to
the maximally ambiguous (audio-only) test stimu-
lus. Under this model, the probability with which a
stimulus is classified as /b/ is proportional to the
likelihood assigned to that cue value by category
/b/, relative to the total likelihood assigned by /b/
and /d/. In addition, under rational belief updating
the likelihood assigned to the exposure stimulus? cue
value will always increase with more exposure. In
the unimodal model the cue dimension is only au-
ditory (with the visual information in the exposure
stimuli only being used to assign category labels),
and so to the unimodal model the ambiguous expo-
sure stimuli and the ambiguous test stimuli are ex-
actly the same. Thus, the probability that the test
stimuli will be categorized as the exposure category
increases monotonically with further exposure.
6 The multimodal model
The unimodal model assumes that the cue dimen-
sions which phonetic categories are defined over
are acoustic, incorporating information from other
modalities only indirectly. This assumption is al-
most certainly wrong, based on work on audio-
visual speech, which shows strong and pervasive
cross-modal interactions (McGurk and MacDonald,
1976; Bejjanki et al, 2011). Indeed, Bertelson et al
(2003) report strong effects of the visual cue used
by Vroomen et al (2007): subjects were at chance
in discriminating acoustically ambiguous versus un-
ambiguous bimodal tokens when the visual cue
matched.
The multimodal model replaces the acoustic per-
cept x in the unimodal model with a phonetic per-
cept which integrates information from audio and
visual cues. Under reasonably general assumptions,
information from auditory and visual cues to the
same phonetic dimension can be optimally com-
bined by a simple weighted sum x = waxa +wvxv,
where the weights wa and wv sum to 1 and are pro-
portional to the reliability of the auditory and visual
cues (Ernst and Banks, 2002; Knill and Saunders,
2003; Jacobs, 2002; Toscano and McMurray, 2010).
Such optimal linear cue-combination can be in-
corporated into our model in an approximate way
by replacing x with a weighted sum of the con-
tinuum values for the auditory and visual tokens
x = wxa + (1 ? w)xv. In the unambiguous con-
ditions, there is no mismatch between these values
(xa, xv = 1 for /aba/ trials and 9 for /ada/ tri-
als), and behavior is the same. In the ambiguous tri-
als, however, the combination of visual and auditory
cues creates a McGurk illusion, and pulls the ob-
served stimulus?now located on a phonetic /aba/-
/ada/ continuum rather than an acoustic one?away

from the maximally ambiguous test stimuli, which
are still located at the middle of the continuum, be-
ing audio-only. This allows recalibration to dom-
inate early, as the mean of the adapted category
moves towards the adapting percept, but be reversed
later, as the precision increases with further expo-
sure percepts, all tightly clustered around the new,
intermediate mean (Figure 6).
To be optimal, w must be the relative reliability
(precision) of audio cues relative to visual cues, but
in this preliminary model it is treated as a free pa-
rameter, between 0 and 1, and fit to each subject?s
test data individually, in the same way as the confi-
dence parameters ? and ?.
The best fitting models? predictions are shown av-
eraged across subjects in Figure 5 (bottom panel).
Unlike the unimodal model, the multimodal model
clearly captures the initial rise and later fall of recal-
ibration for ambiguous stimuli, and captures a fair
amount of the variation between subjects (Figure 7).
7 Discussion
The Bayesian belief updating model developed in
this paper, which takes into account cross-modal cue
integration, provides a good qualitative fit to both
the overall direction and detailed time-course of two
very different types of adaptation of phonetic cat-
egories, recalibration and selective adaptation, as
studied by Vroomen et al (2007). This constitutes
a first step towards a novel theoretical framework
for understanding the flexibility that characterizes
the mapping between phonetic categories to acoustic
(and other) cues. There is a large number of models
which adhere to the basic principles outlined here,
and we have investigated only two of the simplest
ones in order to show that, firstly, selective adapta-
tion and recalibration can be considered the product
of the same underlying inferential process, and sec-
ondly, this process likely occurs at the level of mul-
timodal phonetic percepts.
One of the most striking findings from this work,
which space precludes discussing in depth, is that
all subjects? data is fit best when the strength of the
prior beliefs is quite low, corresponding to a few
hundred or thousand prior examples, which is many
orders of magnitude less than the number of /b/s
and /d/s a normal adult has encountered in their life.
Why should this number be so low? The answer
lies in the fact that phonetic adaptation is often ex-
tremely specific, at the level of a single speaker or
situation. In the future, we plan to model these pat-
terns of specificity and generalization (Kraljic and
17
Samuel, 2007; Kraljic and Samuel, 2006) via hier-
archical extensions of the current model, with con-
nected mixtures of Gaussians for phonetic categories
that vary in predictable ways between groups of
speakers.
Besides being a principled, mathematical frame-
work, Bayesian belief updating and the broader
framework of rational inference under uncertainty
also provides a good framework for understanding
how and why multiple cues are combined in pho-
netic categorization (Toscano and McMurray, 2010;
Jacobs, 2002). Finally, this approach is similar in
spirit and in its mathematical formalisms to models
which treat the acquisition of phonetic categories as
statistical inference, where the number of categories
needs to be inferred, as well as the means and preci-
sions of those categories (Vallabha et al, 2007; Feld-
man et al, 2009a). It is also similar to recent work
on syntactic adaptation (Fine et al, 2010), and thus
constitutes a central part of an emerging paradigm
for understanding language as inference and learn-
ing under uncertain conditions.
