Abstract
This paper presents a set of algorithms for
distinguishing personal names with mul-
tiple real referents in text, based on little
or no supervision. The approach utilizes
an unsupervised clustering technique over
a rich feature space of biographic facts,
which are automatically extracted via a
language-independent bootstrapping pro-
cess. The induced clustering of named
entities are then partitioned and linked to
their real referents via the automatically
extracted biographic data. Performance is
evaluated based on both a test set of hand-
labeled multi-referent personal names and
via automatically generated pseudonames.
1 Introduction
One open problem in natural language ambiguity
resolution is the task of proper noun disambigua-
tion1. While word senses and translation ambigu-
ities may typically have 2-20 alternative meanings
that must be resolved through context, a personal
name such as ?Jim Clark? may potentially refer to
hundreds or thousands of distinct individuals. Each
different referent typically has some distinct contex-
tual characteristics. These characteristics can help
distinguish, resolve and trace the referents when the
surface names appear in online documents.
A search of Google shows 76,000 web pages
mentioning Jim Clark, of which the first 10 unique
referents are:
1This has been recognized even by the popular press.
Reuters (March 13, 2003) observed the problem of name am-
biguity to be a major stumbling block in personal name web
searches.

2. Jim Clark - Clockmaker from Colorado
3. Jim Clark - Film Editor
4. Jim Clark - Netscape Founder
5. Jim Clark - Disaster Survivor
6. Jim Clark - Car Salesman in Kansas
7. Jim Clark - Fishing Instructor in Canada
8. Jim Clark - Computer Science student in Hong Kong
9. Jim Clark - Professor at McGill
10. Jim Clark - Gun Dealer in Louisiana
In this paper, we present a method for dis-
tinguishing the real world referent of a given
name in context. Approaches to this problem
include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the
variation of surface name for a given referent,
and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic
name ambiguity. We present preliminary evaluation
on pseudonames: conflations of multiple personal
names, constructed in the same way pseudowords
are used for word sense disambiguation (Gale et al,
1992). We then present corroborating evidence from
real personal name polysemy to show that this tech-
nique works in practice.

1000 Web Pages
Another topic of recent interest is in producing
biographical summaries from corpora (Schiffman et
al., 2001). Along with disambiguation, our system
simultaneously collects biographic information (Ta-
ble 1). The relevant biographical attributes are de-
picted along with a clustering which shows the dis-
tinct referents (Section 4.1).
2 Robust Extraction of Categorical
Biographic Data
Past work on this task (e.g. Bagga and Baldwin,
1998) has primarily approached personal name dis-
ambiguation using document context profiles or vec-
tors, which recognize and distinguish identical name
instances based on partially indicative words in con-
text such as computer or car in the Clark case. How-
ever, in the specialized case of personal names, there
is more precise information available.
In particular, information extraction techniques
can add high precision, categorical information such
as approximate age/date-of-birth, nationality and
occupation. This categorical data can support or
exclude a candidate name?referent matches with
higher confidence and greater pinpoint accuracy
than via simple context vector-style features alone.
Another major source of disambiguation infor-
mation for proper nouns is the space of associated
names. While these names could be used in a undif-
ferentiated vector-based bag-of-words model, fur-
ther accuracy can be gained by extracting specific
types of association, such as familial relationships
(e.g. son, wife), employment relationships (e.g.
manager of), and nationality as distinct from sim-
ple term co-occurrence in a window. The Jim Clark
married to ?Vickie Parker-Clark? is likely not the
same Jim Clark married to ?Patty Clark?. Addi-
tionally, information about one?s associates can help
predict information about the person in question.
Someone who frequently associates with Egyptians
is likely to be Egyptian, or at the very least, has a
close connection to Egypt.
2.1 Generating Extraction Patterns
One standard method for generating extraction pat-
terns is simply to write them by hand. In this paper,
we have experimented with generating patterns au-
tomatically from data. This has the advantage of be-
ing more flexible, portable and scalable, and poten-
tially having higher precision and recall. It also has
the advantage of being applicable to new languages
for which no developer with sufficient knowledge of
the language is available.

Figure 1: Learning Extraction Patterns from Filled
Templates and Web Pages
In the late 90s, there was a substantial body of
research on learning information extraction patterns
from templates (Huffman, 1995; Brin, 1998; Califf
and Mooney, 1998; Freitag and McCallum, 1999;
Yangarber et al, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy,
2002). These techniques provide a way to bootstrap
information extraction patterns from a set of exam-
ple extractions or seed facts, where a tuple with the
filled roles for the desired pattern are given. For
the task of extracting biographical information, each
example would include the personal name and the
biographic feature. For example, training data for
the pattern born in might be (?Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart?,1756). Given this set of examples, each
method generates patterns differently.
In this paper, we employ and extend the method
described by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) shown
in Figure 1. For each seed fact pair for a given tem-
plate (such as (Mozart,1756)), a web query is made
which in turn leads to sentences in which the roles
are observed in nearby association (e.g. ?Mozart
was born in 1756?). All substrings from these sen-
tences are then extracted. The substrings are then
subject to simple generalization, to produce can-
didate patterns: Mozart is replaced by <name>,
1756 is replaced by <birth year>, and all digits
are replaced by #. These substring templates can

then serve as extraction patterns for previously un-
known fact pairs, and their precision in fact extrac-
tion can be calculated with respect to a set of cur-
rently known facts.
We examined a subset of the available and desir-
able extracted information. We learned patterns for
birth year and occupation, and hand-coded patterns
for birth location, spouse, birthday, familial relation-
ships, collegiate affiliations and nationality. Other
potential patterns currently under investigation in-
clude employer/employee and place of residence.
2.2 Multilingual Information Extraction
We adapted the information extraction pattern gen-
eration techniques described above to multiple lan-
guages. In particular, the methodology proposed by
Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) requires no parsing
or other language specific resources, so is an ideal
candidate for multilingual use. In this paper, we
conducted an initial test test of the viability of in-
ducing these information extraction patterns across
languages. To test, we constructed a initial database
of 5 people and their birthdays, and used this to in-
duce the English patterns. We then increased the
database to 50 people and birthdays and induced pat-
terns for Spanish, presenting the results above. Fig-
ure 2 shows the top precision patterns extracted for
English and for Spanish.
It can be seen that the Spanish patterns are of
the same length, with similar estimated precision, as
well as similar word and punctuation distribution as
the English ones. In fact, the purely syntactic pat-
terns look identical. The only difference being that
to generate equivalent Spanish data, a database of
training examples an order of magnitude larger was
required. This may be because for each database en-
try more pages were available on English websites
than on Spanish websites.
3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to
Identify the Referents of Personal Names
This section examines clustering of web pages
which containing an ambiguous personal name
(with multiple real referents). The cluster method
we employed is bottom-up centroid agglomerative
clustering. In this method, each document is as-
signed a vector of automatically extracted features.
At each stage of the clustering, the two most similar
vectors are merged, to produce a new cluster, with
a vector equal to the centroid of the vectors in the
cluster. This step is repeated until all documents are
clustered.
To generate the vectors for each document, we ex-
plored a variety of methods:
1. Baseline : All words (plain) or only Proper
Nouns (nnp)
2. Most Relevant words (mi and tf-idf)
3. Basic biographical features (feat)
4. Extended biographical Features (extfeat)

mation with the document collection and all of ex-
tended feature words for DAVIS/HARRELSON pseudon-

3.1 Baseline Models
In our baseline models, we used term vectors com-
posed either of all words (minus a set of closed class
?stop? words) or of only proper nouns. To assess
similarity between vectors we utilized standard co-
sine similarity (cos(a, b) = a?b||a||?||b||).
We experimentally determined that the use of
proper nouns alone led to more pure clustering. As
a result, for the remainder of the experiments, we
used only proper nouns in the vectors, except for
those common words introduced by the various fea-
ture sets.
3.2 Relevant Words (mi and tf-idf)
Selective term weighting has been shown to be
highly effective for information retrieval. For this
study, we investigated both the use of standard TF-
IDF weighting and weighting based on the mutual
information, where given a document collection c,
for each word w, we calculate I(w; c) = p(w|c)p(w) .
From these, we select words which appear more
than ?1 = 20 times in the collection, and have a
I(w; c) greater than ?2 = 10. These words are to
the document?s feature vector with a weight equal to
log(I(w; c)).
3.3 Extracted Biographical Features (feat)
The next set of models use the features extracted
using the methodology described in Section 2. Bi-
ographical information such as birth year, and oc-
cupation, when found, is quite useful in connecting
documents. If a document connects a name with a
birth year, and another document connects the same
name with the same birth year, typically, those two
documents refer to the same person.

occupation actor (11), trumpeter(9),
heavyweight(2) ...
spouse Demi Moore(1)
Table 4: feat: Features Extracted for
DAVIS/HARRELSON pseudoname
These extracted features were used to categori-
cally cluster documents in which they appeared. Be-
cause of their high degree of precision and speci-
ficity, documents which contained similar extracted
features are virtually guaranteed to have the same
referent. By clustering these documents first, large
high quality clusters formed, which then then pro-
vided an anchor for the remaining pages. By ex-
amining the dendrogram in Figure 3, it is clear that
the clusters start with documents with matching fea-
tures, and then the other documents cluster around
this core.
In addition to improving disambiguation perfor-
mance, these extracted features help distinguish the
different clusters, and provide information about the
different people.
3.4 Extended Biographical Features (extfeat)
Another method for using these extracted features is
to give higher weight to words which have ever been
seen as filling a pattern. For example, if 1756 is ex-
tracted as a birth year from a syntactic-based pattern
for the polysemous name, then whenever 1756 is
observed anywhere in context (outside an extraction
pattern), it is given a higher weighting and added to
the document vector as a potential biographic fea-
ture. In our experiments, we did this only for words
which appeared as values for a feature more than a
threshold of 4 times. Then, whenever the word was
seen in a document, it was given a weight equal to
the log of the number of times the word was seen as
an extracted feature.

3.5 Cluster Refactoring
Ideally, the raw unsupervised clustering would yield
a top level distinction between the different refer-
ents. However, this is rarely the case. With this
type of agglomerative clustering, the most similar
pages are clustered first, and outliers are assigned
as stragglers at the top levels of the cluster tree.
This typically leads to a full clustering where the
top-level clusters are significantly less discrimina-
tive than those at the roots. In order to compensate
for this effect, we performed a type of tree refac-
toring, which attempted to pick out and utilize seed
clusters from within the entire clustering.
In the refactoring, the clustering is stopped be-
fore it runs to completion, based on the percentage
of documents clustered and the relative size of the
clusters achieved. At this intermediate stage, rel-
atively large and high-precision clusters are found
(e.g. Figure 2). These automatically-induced clus-
ters are then used as seeds for the next stage, where
the unclustered documents are assigned to the seed
with the closest distance measure (Figure 3).
An alternative to this form of cluster refactoring
would be to initially cluster only pages with ex-
tracted features. This would yield a set of cluster
seeds, divided by features, which could then be used
for further clustering. However, this method relies
on having a number of pages with extracted features
that overlap from each referent. This can only be

ization for DAVIS/HARRELSON pseudoname
assured when the feature set is rich, or a large docu-
ment space is assumed.
4 Experiments
To test these clustering methods, we collected web
pages by making requests to the Google website for
a set of target personal names (up to a maximum
of 1000 pages per name). There was no require-
ment that the web page be focused on that name, nor
was there a minimum number of name occurrences.
As a result, some pages clustered only mentioned
the name in passing, or in a specialized, commercial
context (e.g. Amazon sales product).
The pseudonames were created as follows. The
retrieval results from two different randomly-
selected people were taken, and all references to
either name (in full or part) replaced by a unique,
shared pseudoname. The resulting collection then
consisted of documents which were ambiguous as
to whom they talked about. The aim of the clus-
tering was then to distinguish this artificially con-
flated pseudoname. In addition, a test set of four
naturally occurring polysemous names (such as Jim
Clark), containing an average of 60 instances each,
was manually annotated with distinguishing nameID
numbers and used for a parallel evaluation.
The experiments consist of two parts. The first
output is the clustering visualizations whose utility
can be judged by inspection. The second is a quanti-
tative analysis of the different methodologies. Both
are conducted over test sets of pseudonames and nat-
urally occurring ambiguities.
4.1 Clustering Visualizations
Figures 2/3 and 4 each have two subfigures. The
left/top figure shows the extracted seed sets. The
right/bottom figure shows the final clustering of the
entire document collection. In each figure, there
are three columns of information before the dendro-
gram. The first column contains high weighted doc-
ument content words. The second column contains
the extracted features from the document. The third
column indicates the real referent. This is either the
real name of the conflated pseudoname (e.g. Woody
Harrelson or Miles Davis), or a number indicating
the referent (e.g. 1 - 20 in the case of Jim Clark).
This presentation allows a quick scan of the cluster-
ing to reveal correlations.
In general, the visualizations are informative. Oc-
casionally, the extractions err. One time when the
patterns themselves cannot be syntactically faulted
comes in the case where Woody Harrelson?s wife
is extracted as Demi Moore. The information was
extracted from the sentence: ?Architect Woody Har-
relson and his wife realtor Demi Moore ...? which
appears as a plot description for the movie ?Inde-

cent Proposal?. Here, untangling of synecdoche is
needed. For Miles Davis, the incorrectly extracted
birth years refer to record release dates, which take
the same surface form as birth years in some genres.
Figure 4 shows a clustering for a naturally occur-
ing name ambiguity, in particular that of web pages
which refer to ?Jim Clark?. The set was constructed
by retrieving 100 web pages, and then labeling the
pages with respect to their referent. As can be seen,
the clusterings are highly coherent. All of the rele-
vant pages are included in the seed set, and few in-
appropriate pages are added. This type of clustering
would be useful to someone searching for a specific
individual named Jim Clark. Once the clustering had
been performed, a user could scan the output, and
identity the ?Jim Clark? of interest, based both on
extracted features and key words.
4.2 Evaluation on Pseudonames
For automated pseudoname evaluation purposes, we
selected a set of 8 different people for confla-
tion, who we presumed had one vastly predominant
sense. We selected these people giving room for his-
torical figures, figures from pop culture and mod-
ern media culture, as well as ?ordinary? people. We
added people with similar backgrounds (born close
to each other, or having the same profession). The
full list was composed of these 8 individuals:
Haifa Al-Faisal, William Blake, Tom
Cruise, Woody Harrelson, Hermann
Hesse, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Anna
Shusterman, Bryon Tosoff
For each, we submitted Google queries, and re-
trieved up to 1000 pages each. We then took these
hit returns, and subsampled to a maximum of 100
pages per person. The person with the smallest rep-
resentation was Anna Shusterman with 26 pages.
We subsampled by taking the first 100 as ordered
lexically. This may have biased the results some-
what towards unreliable web pages, since pages with
numeric addresses tend to be newer and more tran-
sient.
We evaluated two guanularities of feature extrac-
tion. The small feature set uses high precision
rules to extract occupation (occ), birthday (brthyr),
spouse, birth location (brthloc), and school. The
large feature set adds higher recall (and therefore
noisier) patterns for the previous relationships and
as well as parent/child relationships.
As can be seen from the table, the highest per-
forming system combines proper nouns, relevant
words, and the high precision extracted features
(nnp+feat+mi and nnp+feat+tfidf). The extended
features (nnp+feat+extfeat+mi) do not give addi-
tional benefit to this combination. As can be seen
from the table, the large feature set yields better
overall performance than the smaller feature set.

Table 5: Disambiguation Accuracy of different
Clustering Methods over 28 pseudonames
This suggests that the increased coverage outweighs
the introduced noise.
For the feat+tfidf system, accuracy at the two-
class disambiguation was above 80% for 25 out of
the 28 pairs. Without these pairs, the average two-
class disambiguation performance over the remain-
ing pairs is 90%. In two of the problematic cases, the
contexts of the names are easily confusable, as the
individuals share the same profession and many of
the same keywords. More complete biographic pro-
files and different clustering biases would be helpful
in fully partitioning these cases. However, in prac-
tice these pseudoname pair situations may be more
difficult than expected for naturally occurring name
pairs. In many occupations that are typically news-
worthy (such as actors, authors, musicians, politi-
cians, etc.), there may be a tendency for individu-
als to avoid using identical names (or entering the
field entirely) to minimize confusion. When people
with identical names do indeed share the same field
one would expect a greater effort to providing dis-
ambiguating contextual features to distinguish them.
We have made some preliminary investigations
into selecting pages according to the number of
mentions, as opposed to by random. The results
have not been conclusive, and continuing work is in-
vestigating the cause.
4.3 Evaluation on Naturally Ambiguous Names
The above results have utilized pseudoname test sets
where high accuracy ground truth is automatically
available in large quantities [O(1000) examples per
name] to better distinguish model performance. Ta-
ble 6 shows the performance on the four O(60) ex-
ample hand-labeled test sets for naturally occurring
polysemous person names. Given that this is an
n-ary classification task, for consistency with the
above experiments the data were assigned to one
of 3 clusters, corresponding to the 2 automatically
derived first-pass majority seed sets and the resid-
ual ?other-use? classification, but evaluated strictly
on performance for the two major senses. While
additional analyses could be accomplished on the
residual sets, this is difficult given their small size
(remaining personal exemplars were mostly single-
tons) and lack of evidence on many single-mention
web pages. Thus the task of accurately partitioning
the two most common uses and clustering the resid-
ual examples for visual exploration may be a natural
and practical use for these classification and visual-
ization technologies.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented a set of algorithms
for finding the real referents for ambiguous per-
sonal names in text using unsupervised clustering
and feature extraction methods. In particular, we
have shown how to learn and use automatically ex-
tracted biographic information to improve clustering
results, and have demonstrated this improvement by
evaluating on pseudonames. We have presented ini-
tial results on learning these patterns to extract bio-
graphic information for multiple languages, and in-
tend to use these techniques for large-scale multilin-
gual polysemous name clustering.
The results presented here support the automatic
clustering of polysemous personal name referents
and visualization of these induced clusters and their
motivating features. These distinct referents can
be verified by inspection both of extracted features
and of the high weighted terms for each document.
These clusterings may be useful in two ways. First
as a useful visualization tool themselves, and second
as seeds for disambiguating further entities.
