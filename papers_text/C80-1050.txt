Summary  
We succeeded in mak ing  a program hav ing  
the fo l low ing  four funct ions :  
i. segment ing  the Japanese  sentence  
2. t rans l i te ra t ing  f rom Ch inese  
characters  (ca l led  Kan~i  in Japa-  
nese) to the Japanese  sy l labary  
(kana) or to Roman le t te rs  
3. c lass i fy ing  the par ts -o f - speech  in 
the Japanese  vocabu lary  
4. mak ing  a concordance  
We are us ing  this p rogram for the pre-  
ed i t ing  of surveys  of Japanese  vocabu-  
lary. 
In Japanese  wr i t ing  we use many k inds  of 
wr i t ing  systems,  i.e. KanOi ,  kana, the 
a lphabet ,  numera ls ,  and so on. We have 
thought  of this as a demer i t  in language 
data process ing .  But we can change this 
f rom a demer i t  to a mer i t .  That  is, we 
can make good use of these many wr i t ing  
sys tems in our program.  
Our program has only  a smal l  tab le  con- 
ta in ing  300 units .  And it is very  fast. 
In our exper iments  we have obta ined  
approx imate ly  90% cor rec t  answers .  
In t roduct ion  
Obta in ing  c lean date is very impor tant  
in language data process ing .  There are 
two prob lems here.  One is how to input 
the Japanese  text and the other  is how 
to f ind er rors  in the data and cor rec t  
them. The human be ing  is su i ted  to com- 
p l i ca ted  work  but not to s imple  work.  
The mach ine ,  on the cont rary ,  is su i ted  
to s imple  work  but not to compl i ca ted  
work.  In the word  count  sys tem us ing  
computers ,  the mach ine  has s imple  work  
(sort ing,  computat ion ,  mak ing  a l ist) ,  
and the humans  have compl i ca ted  work  
( segmentat ion ,  t rans l i te ra t ion  f rom 
Kan~i  to kana, c lass i f i ca t ion  of parts  
of speech,  f ind ing  errors  in the data, 
d i sc r iminat ion  of homonyms and homo-  
graphs,  e ts . ) .  
However ,  in this sys tem there is one 
major  p rob lem -- humans  of ten make mis-  
takes.  And, regret tab ly ,  we cannot  pre-  
dict  where  they wi l l  make them. Thus we 
dec ided  to make an automat ic  p rocess ing  
system. This sys tem has to be compact ,  
fast,  and over 90% accurate .  
In Japanese  wr i t ing  we genera l ly  use 
many k inds  of wr i t ing  systems.  
For example ,  
In this example  sentence  we f ind used 
the a lphabet  (C, O, L, I, N, G), numer -  
als (8, 0), kana (h i rasana  - - the  Japa-  
nese curs ive  sy l labary  -- ~, O ,~,  ~,~,  
~,  and katakana  -- the Japanese  
s t ra ight - l ined  sy l labary  - -~  , ~ ,  ~ , - ,  
,~ , -  , j~ ), Kan j i  ( ~ .~,~,~i ,  ~,~i~ ), 
and s igns (.). And as you can see, there 
are no spaces  left  between words .  This 
makes Japanese  data process ing  d i f f i cu l t .  
Our p rogram makes  good use of these di f -  
ferent  e lements  in the wr i t ing  system. 
At p resent  the automat ic  p rocess ing  pro- 
gram makes  more mis takes  than humans  do. 
But we can pred ic t  where  it wi l l  make 
them and eas i ly  cor rec t  errors  in the 
data. 
Ob jec t ive  
Our ob jec t ive  is a sys tem hav ing  the 
fo l low ing  funct ions :  
i. segmentat ion  
2. t ran l i te ra t ion  f rom Kan j i  to kana 
3. c lass i f i ca t ion  of parts  of speech 
4. add ing  lex ica l  in fo rmat ion  by use 
of a d ic t ionary  
5. mak ing  a concordance  
6. mak ing  a word  l ist 
Numbers  i, 2, and 3 are espec ia l l y  im- 
por tant  for our program.  Our repor t  wi l l  
ma in ly  deal w i th  these three funct ions .  
The input  data is genera l ly  a text wr i t -  
ten in Japanese .  The output  is a con- 
cordance  sor ted  in the Japanese  a lpha-  
bet i ca l  order,  g iv ing  in fo rmat ion  of the 
parts  of speech,  and marked  w i th  a the- 
saurus  number .

System 
F igure  i is a f low chart  of our program.  
Input  is by magnet ic  tape, paper  tape, 
or card. The input  code is the NLRI  
(Nat iona l  Language Research  Ins t i tu te )  
code or some other  code. Of course  we 
have  a code convers ion  program from other  
codes to the NLRI  code. 
The second b lock  of F igure  1 shows what  
we cal l  the automat ic  p rocess ing  of nat -  
ural  l anguage.  In the superv isor  square  
we check  and se lect  the resu l t s  of the 
three automat ic  p rocess ing  programs.  
Some of these programs have many k inds 
of p rocess ing  of natura l  language 
For example ,  the automat ic  segmentat ion  
program invo lves  the c lass i f i ca t ion  of 
parts  of speech,  automat ic  syntact i c  
ana lys i s ,  automat ic  t rans l i te ra t ion  f rom 
Kan~i  to kana, and so on. (An example  
w i l l  be found in the next  sect ion . )  
In the add ing  lex ica l  in fo rmat ion  b lock  
of F igure  i, we make use of the d ic t ion -  
ary obta ined  by research  into some 5 
mi l l i on  words  at the NLRI .  This d ic t ion -  
ary inc ludes  word  f requenc ies ,  parts  of 
speech,  c lasses  by word  or ig in ,  and 
a thesaurus  number .  
By us ing  the concordance  we can f ind and 
cor rec t  er rors  in the data. As our pro-  
gram is un for tunate ly  not a lways  com- 
p lete,  this concordance  is very  usefu l .  
In the output  b lock  of F igure  i we can 
choose a var ie ty  of output  dev ices  -- an 
a lphabet  l ine pr in ter ,  a kana l ine 
pr in ter ,  a h igh-speed Kan~i  p r in te~,  or 
a Kan~i  d isp lay .  
Method  
i. Automat ic  t rans l i te ra t ion  f rom Kan j i  
to Roman le t te rs  
The Ch inese  characters  have many d i f fe r -  
ent read ings  in Japanese .  For example ,  
/ sei/  /syo/ /um-/ / iki /  nama/  /ai/ 
/ tachi /  / tatsu/  / tate/  /dach i /  
/ r i t su /  / r i t to ru /  
-- / ichi /  / i tsu/  /kazu/  ha j ime/ /h i to /  
We have to a r range  the Japanese  words  in 
the Japanese  a lphabet ica l  order .  
The program puts the read ing  way to each 
word  for the word  l ist. 
The method  of se lec t ing  the read ing  is 
to choose it in accordance  wi th  the 
sur round ings  of the Kan j i  in the text. 
The poss ib le  read ings  for each Kan j i  are 
l i s ted  in a smal l  table.  The records  in 
this table are of 3 types -  Groups l ,2 ,  and 
3 represented  by numbers  i ;2,3~ and 4,5, 
6 respect ive ly  in F igure  2. 
The Kan j i  in Group i have one read ing  
each. The program rep laces  the KanOi  
w i th  this read ing.  In F igure  2, No. I 
fa l ls  into this category .  We have about  
700 K anj i  in Group i (~ ,~ ,~,~ ,~,  
ets . ) .  
The Kan j i  in Group 2 have tow or more  
read ings  each. In F igure  2, Nos.  2 and 3 
fal l  into this category .  
The fo rmat  for these ent r ies  is group 
number ,  the Kan j i ,  the operat ion  code (a 
numera l  or Cap i ta l  le t ter ) ,  and the 
read ing  (up to 8 smal l  le t ters ) .  
The appropr ia te  read ing  is chosen for 
the s i tuat ion  of the Kani j  in accordance  
wi th  Tab le  i.

F igure  3 g ives a sample  of the resu l ts  
of our exper iments .  The Kan j i /~ / in  no. 
1 here is a group 2 KanJ i .  Its s i tuat ion  
in the context  /~<~/ is  that in front 
of it is the Kan~i /~/  and beh ind  it is 
the non-Kan j i /~ /  . When the context  is 
Kan j i  + non-Kan j i ,  the program se lects  
read ing  i /ka/ .  The s i tuat ion  o~/ in  
context /~ ~%O/ is  non-Kan j i  + non-Kan j i  
so the read ing  A /#uta /  is se lected.  AS a 
resu l t /~%P/  is t rans l i te ra ted  to 
/ko#ukawo#uta#u/ .  
Group 2 conta ins  1500 Ch inese  characters .  
The Kan j i  in Group 3 have a spec ia l  
read ing  in a spec ia l  context  in add i t ion  
to their  regu lar  mean ings .  In F igure  2, 
Nos. 4, 5, and 6 are in this group.  In 
F igure  3,/)bl/in No. 2 can be processed  
w i thout  a spec ia l  read ing,  but in no. 3 
the spec ia l  read ing  is needed.  To obta in  
this reading,  the spec ia l  context  a f ter  
the the sign * is app l ied .  The format,  
as in F igure  2, no. 4, is group number  
(3), Kan j i  ())I) , read ing  number  (i, 2), 
operat ion  code (8, H), read ing,  s ign (*~ 
code for f ront  or beh ind(M,  N) , Kan j i  
~ , ~F  ), and app l ied  read ing  number ( l ,

In this case read ing  number  1 is app l ied

The mer i ts  of this method are that the 
table is smal l  and the process  fast. If 
we had a table l i s t ing  vocabu lary  rather  
than Kanj i ,  it wou ld  be much larger  , 
requ i r ing  at least  70,000 entr ies .  
One demer i t  is that the process  does not 
complete ly  cover all cases. The phenom-  
enon of rendaku or renjo,  in par t i cu la r ,  
requ i res  spec ia l  contexts .  There  are no 
rules for this. Examples  of rendaku and 
ren jo  are fo l lows:

2. Automat ic  segmentat ion  
We do not use spaces between words  in 
Japanese ,  but we do use many d i f fe rent  
e lements  in our wr i t ing  system. There 
are Kan j i ,  kana (h i ragana  and katakana) ,  
the a lphabet ,  numera ls ,  and signs.  
F igure  4 shows the rat io  of these ele- 
ments  in Japanese  newspapers .  If we look 
at a Japanese  text as a s t r ing  of dif -  
ferent  k inds of characters ,  we can 
rep lace  the characters  of a Japanese  
sentence  wi th  the abbrev ia t ions  of Tab le

In Japanese  compos i t ion  we are taught 
the proper  use of the d i f fe rent  char-  
acters  in this way: 
Kan j i  - to express  concepts ;  more 
concrete ly ,  for nouns,  the 
stems of verbs,  etc. 
h i ragana  - for par t i c les ,  aux i l i a ry  
verbs~I the  end ings  of verbs 
and ad jec t ives ,  wr i t ing

katakana  - for bor rowed words,  fo re ign  
persona l  and p lace names,  
onomatopoe ia ,  etc. 
a lphabet  for abbrev ia t ions

F igure  5. Tab le  for segmentat ion  and 
C lass i f i ca t ion  of parts  of 
speech  
H i ragana-H i ragana type is use of the 
second most  f requent  combinat ions  in 
Japanese .  Accord ing  to Tab le  2, We are 
unab le  to segment  for this combinat ion .  
'Therefore we make the fo l low ing  rule. 
The h i ragana/~/ i s  used only as a par t i -  
cle and we a lways segment  at it. The 
other  h i rasana  characters  are segmented  
accord ing  to the character  s t r ing  table  
found in F igure  5. The format,  as in the 
second l ine in F igure  5, is the number  
of characters  in the s t r ing  (4), the 
character  s t r ing  (up to i0 characters )  
(C ~ L ~) ,  the length of the words  ( 2 , 
I , i ), the parts  of speech  (C, E, P), 
and the con jugat ion  (9). 
This table conta ins  only 300 records.  
These are the par t i c les ,  aux i l i a ry  verb~ 
adverbs ,  and character  s t r ings  wh ich  
cannot  be segmented  by Tabie  3 (ex. C Jb~ 
in F igure  5). 
This table is app l ied  as fo l lows.  The 
program f i rst  searches  the character  
s t r ings  of the table in the input  sen- 
tences.  If a character  s t r ing  (~gb~)  
fits part  of an input sentence  ( E~b~ 
l:I~ ), then the program segments  it into 
parts  by the lengths  of words  in the 
table and adds the in fo rmat ion  about the 
parts  of speech  and con jugat ion .  As a 
resu l t  we obta in  the words  (~/  b / ~ /). 
F igure  6 shows the resu l ts  of automat ic  
segmentat ion  and automat ic  t rans l i te ra -  
t ion f rom Kan j i  to Roman letters .  The 
operat ion  of Table  3 has resu l ted  in no 
segmentat ion  for the s t r ings  ( /COL ING80 
/) , ( /~ / )  , (/~rff-~y~--$--J~/), and (/~{!~ 
/) as we l l  as the segmentat ion  at the 
s ign (/./) . The operat ion  of the table 
in F igure  5 has resu l ted  in the segmen-  
tat ion for the h i rasana  (/ ~ / ) ,  (/ ~ / ) ,  
(/ V /), ( /~  /), and ( /~  /). 
3. Automat ic  c lass i f i ca t ion  of par ts  of 
speech 
In order  to ana lyze  the vocabu lary  we 
have to c lass i fy  it by parts  of speech.  
The program dose this by three methods .  
The f i rst  method is by us ing the table 
found in F igure  5. 
The second method is by the form of the 
word,  app ly ing  the rules below.  The ra- 
tio of correct  answers  obta ined  is g iven 
in parentheses  af ter  each rule. 
i. If the last character  of the word 
is in Kanj i ,  ka takana ,or  the al- 
phabet ,  then the word  is a noun. 
(94.4%) 
2. If the last character  is/~/,  then 
it is a verb in the renyo form 
(con jugat ion)  or an ad jec t ive  in 
the syush i  or renta l  form. (86.2%) 
3. If the last character  is/~ /, then 
it is a verb in the syush i  or 
renta l  form or an ad jec t ive  in the 
reny_o_ form. (83.4%)

4. If the last character  is/Y/ ,  then 
it is verb, syush i  form. (95.8%) 
5. If the last character  is /K/ ,  then 
it is verb, kate i  form, or demon-  
s t ra t ive  pronoun,  or aux i l i a ry  
verb~ I (92.9%) 
6. If the last character  is /b/ ,  then 
it is verb, me i re i  form, or noun. 
(63.3%) 
7. If the last tow characters  a r~/ ,  
then it is ad jec t ive ,  mizen  form, 
or verb,  renyo form. (74.2%) 
8. If the last character  is /~ /, then 
it is verb,  renyo form. (79.6%) 
9. If the last tow characters  are 
Kan j i -h i rasana , then  it is a verb.  
(94.4%) 
If the vowel  of the last h i rasana  
is /a/, then its con jugat ion  is 
mizen  or renyo form, and 
if it is /i/, then it is mizen  or 
renyo 
if it is /u/, then it is syush i  or 
renta l  
if it is /e/, then it is kate i  or 
me i re i  
if it is /o/, then it is me i re i  
i0. If the last character  is a numera l ,  
then it is a f igure  and if it is a 
sign, then it is a sign. 
The th i rd method is by word combinat ions .  
That is, in Japanese  grammer  word  combi -  
nat ion  -- espec ia l l y  of nouns or verbs 
and par t i c les  or aux i l i a ry  verb~ ~-  is 
not free. The fo rmula  g iven in F igure  7 
is made f rom this rule. 
Its format is as fo l lows:  
i. the word  
2. its part  of speech 
3. aux i l i a ry  verbs~r  par t i c les  wh ich  
can be used in front of this word  
4. parts  of speech  and con jugat ions  
wh ich  can be used in front of this 
word  
5. if 3 and 4 do not agree then 5 ap- 
p l ies  ob l igator i l y .

and convers ion  f rom kana to Roman 
le t ters  are used for each program.  
2. The in fo rmat ion  obta ined  in auto-  
mat ic  t rans l i te ra t ion  is used in 
segmentat ion .  
Namely ,  if the spec ia l  context  is 
app l ied ,  then the program does not 
segment  at that po int  because  the 
character  s t r ing  is a word.  
3. The in fo rmat ion  obta ined  at the 
convers ion  f rom kana to Roman 
le t ters  is used in segmentat ion .  
Namely ,  if the consonant  of the 
Romanized  Japanese  is (*), (J), or 
(Q)--  these are used as spec ia l  
smal l  characters  in kana  -- then 
the program dose not segment  at 
that po int .  
4. The in fo rmat ion  obta ined  in seg-  
mentat ion  is used in c lass i f i ca -  
tion. 
Namely ,  the program obta ins  in for -  
mat ion  concern ing  parts  of speech  
and con jugat ion  through us ing  the 
table  in F igure  5 in segmentat ion .  
Check ing  the resu l ts  of the process ing  
invo lves  the fo l low ing :  
i. Check ing  par t i c le  and aux i l i a ry  
verb s t r ings  obta ined  by the pro-  
g ram at c lass i f i ca t ion .  If these 
s t r ings  are imposs ib le  in Japanese ,  
then the segmentat ion  was mis taken .  
The program cor rec ts  these.  
2. There  are not many words  composed 
of one character  in Japanese  ex- 
cept for par t i c les  and aux i l i a ry  
verbs.  F igure  9 gives the f requen-  
cy of some characters  and the fre-  
quency  of words  cons is t ing  of that 
character  a lone.  
Words  of h igh f requency  that are 
not par t i c les  or aux i l i a ry  verbs 
are produced  by er rors  in segmen-  
tat ion.  The program then cor rec ts  
these er rors ,  combin ing  them into 
longer  words .  
3. If a verb in the renyo form is 
fo l lowed by another  verb,  then it 
is a compound word  and the program 
cor rec ts  the er ror  to p roduce  a 
longer  word.  
F igure  i0 shows the resu l t s  of the 
superv isor  program.  In test sen- 
tence i, the program at f i rst  seg- 
mented  / ~ /L~/ ~ / ~ / as aux i l -  
iary verbs th rough the use of the 
table  in F igure  5. But the super -  
v i sor  p rogram checks and cor rec ts  
this s t r ing  and the c lass i f i ca t ion  
program adds th~ in fo rmat ion  of 
verb to /~t~'~/ ,  as can be seen in 
F igure  i0. 
In test sentence  2, the program at 
f i rst  segmented  it /#ASOBI /SUGI /TA  
/, but the superv isor  p rogram 
checked  this and cor rec ted  this 
s t r ing  to the compound word,  
/#ASOBISUGI / ,p lus  /TA/. 
We can process  Japanese  sentences  us ing  
these methods  and obta in  words  and var i -  
ous in fo rmat ion  about  these words .  With 
this p rogram we can obta in  a rate of 
cor rec t  answers  of approx imate ly  90 
percent .Y3  
We shou ld  be able to improve  this pro-  
gram at the level  of the superv isor  and 
the tables.  However ,  we don' t  th ink that 
it w i l l  be poss ib le  to obta in  i00 
percent  cor rec t  answers  because  this 
sys tem uses Japanese  wr i t ing  and the Jap-  
anese wr i t ing  sys tem is not i00 percent  
s tandard ized .  In add i t ion ,  if we w ish  to 
produce  a complete  program,  it is neces -  
sary to process  on the bas is  of syntax  
and mean ing .  At persent ,  this is not the 
ob ject  of our e f fo r ts .  
5. Add ing  lex ica l  in fo rmat ion  
The Nat iona l  Language Research  Ins t i tu te  
has been invest igat ing  the vocabu lary  of 
modern  Japanese  s ince  1952, and has been 
us ing  the computer  in this research  
s ince 1966. As a resu l t ,  some f ive mi l -  
l ion words  are ava i lab le  as mach ine  
readab le  data. This data conta ins  var i "  
ous in fo rmat ion  such as word  f requency ,  
part  of speech,  c lass by word  or ig in ,  
and thesaurus  number .  The thesaurus ,  
Bunru i  go ih~o in Japanese ,  was produced  
by Doctor  Oki Hayash i .  It conta ins  about  
38 ,000 words  in the natura l  language of 
Japanese .  
6. Mak ing  the concordance  
We wi l l  not exp la in  this p rogram here 
s ince we have wr i t ten  a separate  report  
about  it (number  6 in the l ist  of re fer -  
ences be low) .  P lease  re fer  to this re- 
port  for fu r ther  deta i l s .  
F igure  ii is the resu l t  of this process .
