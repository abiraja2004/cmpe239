Abstract
In the framework of the Tc-Star project,
we analyze and propose a combination of
two Statistical Machine Translation sys-
tems: a phrase-based and an N -gram-based
one. The exhaustive analysis includes a
comparison of the translation models in
terms of efficiency (number of translation
units used in the search and computational
time) and an examination of the errors in
each system?s output. Additionally, we
combine both systems, showing accuracy
improvements.
1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation (SMT) has evolved
from the initial word-based translation models to
more advanced models that take the context sur-
rounding the words into account. The so-called
phrase-based and N -gram-based models are two ex-
amples of these approaches (Zens and Ney, 2004;
Marin?o et al, 2006).
In current state-of-the-art SMT systems, the
phrase-based or the N -gram-based models are usu-
ally the main features in a log-linear framework, rem-
iniscent of the maximum entropy modeling approach.
Two basic issues differentiate the N -gram-based
system from the phrase-based one: the training data
is sequentially segmented into bilingual units; and
the probability of these units is estimated as a bilin-
gual N -gram language model. In the phrase-based
model, no monotonicity restriction is imposed on the
segmentation and the probabilities are normally es-
timated simply by relative frequencies.
This paper extends the analysis of both systems
performed in (Crego et al, 2005a) by additionally
performing a manual error analysis of both systems,
which were the ones used by UPC and RWTH in the
last Tc-Star evaluation.
Furthermore, we will propose a way to combine
both systems in order to improve the quality of trans-
lations.
Experiments combining several kinds of MT sys-
tems have been presented in (Matusov et al, 2006),
based only on the single best output of each system.
Recently, a more straightforward approach of both
systems has been performed in (Costa-jussa` et al,
2006) which simply selects, for each sentence, one of
the provided hypotheses.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
we briefly describe the phrase and the N -gram-based
baseline systems. In the next section we present the
evaluation framework. In Section 4 we report a struc-
tural comparison performed for both systems and, af-
terwards, in Section 5, we analyze the errors of both
systems. Finally, in the last two sections we rescore
and combine both systems, and the obtained results
are discussed.
2 Baseline Systems
2.1 Phrase-based System
The basic idea of phrase-based translation is to seg-
ment the given source sentence into units (here called
phrases), then translate each phrase and finally com-
pose the target sentence from these phrase transla-
tions.
In order to train these phrase-based models, an
alignment between the source and target training
sentences is found by using the standard IBM mod-
els in both directions (source-to-target and target-
to-source) and combining the two obtained align-
ments. Given this alignment an extraction of con-
tiguous phrases is carried out, specifically we extract
all phrases that fulfill the following restrictions: all
source (target) words within the phrase are aligned
only to target (source) words within the phrase.
The probability of these phrases is normally esti-
mated by relative frequencies, normally in both di-
rections, which are then combined in a log-linear way.

2.2 N-gram-based System
In contrast with standard phrase-based approaches,
the N -gram translation model uses tuples as bilin-
gual units whose probabilities are estimated as an
N -gram language model (Marin?o et al, 2006). This
model approximates the joint probability between
the source and target languages by using N -grams.
Given a word alignment, tuples define a unique
and monotonic segmentation of each bilingual sen-
tence, building up a much smaller set of units
than with phrases and allowing N -gram estimation
to account for the history of the translation pro-
cess (Marin?o et al, 2006).
2.3 Feature functions
Both baseline systems are combined in a log-linear
way with several additional feature functions: a tar-
get language model, a forward and a backward lex-
icon model and a word bonus are common features
for both systems. The phrase-based system also in-
troduces a phrase bonus model.
3 Evaluation framework
The translation models presented so far were the ones
used by UPC and RWTH in the second evaluation
campaign of the Tc-Star project. The goal of this
project is to build a speech-to-speech translation sys-
tem that can deal with real life data.
The corpus consists of the official version of the
speeches held in the European Parliament Plenary
Sessions (EPPS), as available on the web page of the
European Parliament. Table 1 shows some statistics.
The following tools have been used for building
both systems: Word alignments were computed us-
ing GIZA++ (Och, 2003), language models were es-
timated using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), de-
coding was carried out by the free available MARIE
decoder (Crego et al, 2005b) and the optimization
was performed through an in-house implementation
of the simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965).

4 Structural comparison
Both approaches aim at improving accuracy by in-
cluding word context in the model. However, the
implementation of the models are quite different and
may produce variations in several aspects.

duced through different settings of the beam size.
Additionally, the number of available translation
units is shown, corresponding to number of avail-
able phrases for the phrase-based system and 1gram,
2gram and 3gram entries for the N -gram-based sys-
tem. Results are computed on the development set.

Table 2: Impact on efficiency of the beam size in PB
(top) and NB system (bottom).
As it can be seen, the number of translation units
is similar in both tasks for both systems (537k ?
537k for Spanish to English and 594k ? 651k for
English to Spanish) while the time consumed in de-
coding is clearly higher for the phrase-based system.
This can be explained by the fact that in the phrase-
based approach, the same translation can be hypoth-
esized following several segmentations of the input
sentence, as phrases appear (and are collected) from
multiple segmentations of the training sentence pairs.
In other words, the search graph seems to be over-
populated under the phrase-based approach.
Table 3 shows the effect on translation accuracy
regarding the size of the beam in the search. Results
are computed on the test set for the phrase-based
and N -gram-based systems.
Results of the N -gram-based system show that de-
creasing the beam size produces a clear reduction
of the accuracy results. The phrase-based system
shows that accuracy results remain very similar un-
der the different settings. The reason is found on
how translation models are used in the search. In
the phrase-based approach, every partial hypothesis

is scored uncontextualized, hence, a single score is
used for a given partial hypothesis (phrase). In the
N -gram-based approach, the model is intrinsically
contextualized, which means that each partial hy-
pothesis (tuple) depends on the preceding sequence
of tuples. Thus, if a bad sequence of tuples (bad
scored) is composed of a good initial sequence (well
scored), it is placed on top of the first stacks (beam)
and may cause the pruning of the rest of hypotheses.
5 Error analysis
In order to better asses the quality and the differ-
ences between the two systems, a human error anal-
ysis was carried out. The guidelines for this error
analysis can be found in (Vilar et al, 2006). We
randomly selected 100 sentences, which were evalu-
ated by bilingual judges.
This analysis reveals that both systems produce
the same kind of errors in general. However some dif-
ferences were identified. For the English to Spanish
direction the greatest problem is the correct genera-
tion of the right tense for verbs, with around 20% of
all translation errors being of this kind. Reordering
also poses an important problem for both phrase and
N-gram-based systems, with 18% or 15% (respec-
tively) of the errors falling into this category. Miss-
ing words is also an important problem. However,
most of them (approximately two thirds for both sys-
tems) are filler words (i.e. words which do not con-
vey meaning), that is, the meaning of the sentence
is preserved. The most remarkable difference when
comparing both systems is that the N -gram based
system produces a relatively large amount of extra
words (approximately 10%), while for the phrase-
based system, this is only a minor problem (2% of
the errors). In contrast the phrase-based system has
more problems with incorrect translations, that is
words for which a human can find a correspondence
in the source text, but the translation is incorrect.
Similar conclusions can be drawn for the inverse di-
rection. The verb generating problem is not so acute
in this translation direction due to the much simpli-
fied morphology of English. An important problem
is the generation of the right preposition.
The N -gram based system seems to be able to pro-
duce more accurate translations (reflected by a lower
percentage of translation errors). However, it gener-
ates too many additional (and incorrect words) in
the process. The phrase-based system, in contrast,
counteracts this effect by producing a more direct
correspondence with the words present in the source
sentence at the cost of sometimes not being able to
find the exact translation.
6 System Rescoring and
Combination
Integration of both output translations in the search
procedure is a complex task. Translation units of
both models are quite different and generation his-
tories pose severe implementation difficulties. We
propose a method for combining the two systems at
the level of N -best lists.
Some features that are useful for SMT are too com-
plex for including them directly in the search pro-
cess. A clear example are the features that require
the entire target sentence to be evaluated, as this is
not compatible with the pruning and recombination
procedures that are necessary for keeping the target
sentence generation process manageable. A possible
solution for this problem is to apply sentence level
re-ranking by using N -best lists.
6.1 Rescoring Criteria
The aim of the rescoring procedure is to choose the
best translation candidate out of a given set of N
possible translations. In our approach this transla-
tion candidates are produced independently by both
of the systems and then combined by a simple con-
catenation1. In order for the hypothesis to have a
comparable set of scores, we perform an additional
?cross-rescoring? of the lists.
Given an N -best list of the phrase-based (N -gram-
based) system, we compute the cost of each target
sentence of this N -best list for the N -gram-based
(phrase-based) system. However this computation
is not possible in all cases. Table 4 shows the per-
centage of target sentences that the N -gram-based

(phrase-based) system is able to produce given an N -
best list of target sentences computed by the phrase-
based (N -gram-based) system. This percentage is
calculated on the development set.
The vocabulary of phrases is bigger than the vo-
cabulary of tuples, due to the fact that phrases are
extracted from multiple segmentations of the train-
ing sentence pairs. Hence, the number of sentences
reproduced by the N -gram-based system is smaller
than the number of sentences reproduced by the
phrase-based system. Whenever a sentence can not
be reproduced by a given system, the cost of the
worst sentence in the N -best list is assigned to it.

7 Discussion
The structural comparison has shown on the one
hand that the N -gram-based system outperforms
the phrase-based in terms of search time efficiency
by avoiding the overpopulation problem presented
in the phrase-based approach. On the other hand
the phrase-based system shows a better performance
when decoding under a highly constrained search.
A detailed error analysis has also been carried out
in order to better determine the differences in per-
formance of both systems. The N -gram based sys-
tem produced more accurate translations, but also a
larger amount of extra (incorrect) words when com-
pare to the phrase-based translation system.
In section 6 we have presented a system combina-
tion method using a rescoring feature for each SMT
system, i.e. the N -gram-based feature for the phrase-
based system and vice-versa. For both systems, con-
sidering the feature of the opposite system leads to
an improvement of BLEU score.
