1. INTRODUCTION 
In ear l ier  papers devoted to interpersonal 
interaction iFrank,1981; Levinson,1981\] much atten- 
tion is paid to studying the role of speecb act (SA) 
i n  d ia logue  s t ructure .  Cons ider ing  SA as a pr inc ipa l  
funct iona l  e lement  o f  language in teract ion  (L I )  i s  
o f  spec ia l  impor tance  fo r  deve lop ing  natura l  
language mode ls  wh ich  are  to  be pract i ca l ly  app l ied  
to  human-computer  natura l - - language in teract ion .  
We proceed from the statement that there are 
not  so l i ta ry  per fo rmed speech  acts  in  rea l  communi -  
ca t ion ,  SAs are interconnected and involved in a 
general LI structure \[Wunderlich,1980\]. 
Within the framework of our approach to the 
formal\[ description of dialogue structure a notion of 
SR-triad ref lect ing the "stimulus-reaction" relation 
between utterances in the dialogue is proposed to 
construct a more adequate representation f dialogue 
structure. Representing any dialogue as a tr iad 
structure (T-structure) in contrast to previous 
analysis \[Hundsnurscher,1981\] is characterized by 
distinguishing three phases in the interaction of 
the type "stimulus-reaction". First we shall 
consider different roles of speech acts in the 
dialogue T-structure. Then we shall introduce three 
types of relations between SR-triads (intersection, 
imbedding and succession) and discuss dialogues with 
a complicated structure which is represented by 
combinations of these relations and ref lects d i f fe-  
rent strategies to attain some goal. 
2. SR-TRIAD AND A TYPOLOGY OF SAS 
Any dialogue is considered to be a sequence of 
SAs distributed in time which is charaterized by: a) 
a change of roles of the speaker and the hearer 
between communication participants (further desig- 
nated as X and Y) and b) certain relations between 
SAs. 
Each SA i s  a imed at  accompl i sh ing  who le  complex  
o f  goa ls / tasks .  The d iscuss ion  o f  the i r  content  i s  
not  re levant  to  the  purposes  o f  th i s  paper .  So we 
conf ine  our  d i scuss ion  to  one goa l  (g .X)  on ly  asso -  
c ia ted  w i th  some SA o f  the  author  X (SA.X) .  The very  
fac t  o f  p roduc ing  an  SA wh ich  " in i t ia tes"  g .X  ra i ses  
be fore  the  addressee  Y a communicat ive  task  to  react  
to  th i s  goa l ,  i .e .  to  c lose  g .X  pos i t ive ly  o r  nega-  
t i ve ly .  Thus between SA.X and  the  fo l low ing  SAs o f  Y 
there  appear  "s t imu lus -  react ion"  re la t ions .  Between 
an in i t ia t ion  and  a c losure  o f  g .X  there  may take  
p lace  in termediate  in teract ions  a imed at  accompl i s -  
h ing  the  communicat ive  task  by Y. The in termediate  
SAs o f  Y a re  assoc ia ted  w i th  goa ls  subord inated  to  
the  communicat ive  task ,  and  the  in termediate  SAs o f  
X wh ich  are  react ions  to  the  cor respond ing  SAs-  
s t lmu l i  o f  Y a re  assoc ia ted  w i th  the  in i t ia t ing  SA.X

of tile SA.X content.

2 .2 .  Let  us enumerate  pr inc ipa l  types  o f  speech  
acts  re f lec t ing  the  ro les  o f  the  SA in  the  d ia logue  
T -s t ructure  and  in t roduce  symbols  to  des ignate  them 
in  schemes .  
(1) An in i t ia t ing  SA i s  a pr imary  in i t ia t ion  o f

(3) A react ive  SA i s  a pos i t ive  or  negat ive

and the  goa l  i s  c losed ,  o therwise  the  react ion  i s  
not  f ina l :  an SA o f  type  (5) fo l lows .  
(4) A complet ing  SA re f lec ts  the  th i rd  phase  o f

re f lec ts  the  th i rd  phase  o f  one t r iad  and the  f i r s t  
phase of the other tr iad which follows i t  
immediately (fig.li). 
In any  dialogue complex  SAs representing the 
combinations of the enumerated structural  types are 
possible. Let us l l s t  some of them: 
(6) An in i t ia t ing  complex  SA i s  a pr imary  in i -  
t ia t ion  of the goal with a complication, e.g. with a 
mot ivat ion  ( f ig .  I f ) .

sure  o f  the  goa l  w i th  a compl icat ion ,  fo r  example :  
a)  a pos i t ive  c losure  w i th  a counter -cond i t ion ;  b) a

I f  the  in teract ion  phases  cor respond ing  to  the  
types  (4) and  (5) a re  expressed  impl i c i t l y  and 
fo l low by defau l t ,  then  they  are  des ignated  in  the  
s t ructura l  schemes  by a dot ted  ar row.  
2 .3 .  The elementary SR-triad describes the 
structure of a minimal interaction (e.g. question -
answer, inducement - refusal e tc . ) .  The structural  
schemes  given in f ig .2  i l l us t ra te  the  pos i t ive  (a)

of Y to g.X .  
SA2.X i s  an acceptance  o f  Y ' s  react ion  by X (may 
be expressed  impl i c i t l y ) .  
In the  e lementary  SR- t r iad  each  SA is s imple ,  
without a complication. SR-triads descr ibe  both the 
dialogue fragments and simplest dialogues.The la t ter  
do not seem to be rare or a r t i f i c ia l  \[cf. Hundsnur- 
scher ,1981 J ,  they  are  ent i re ly  typ ica l ,  e .g .  in  
communicative s i tuat ion with random unknown part-

SA2.X: Thanks .  
(b) SA1.X: Have you  a c igaret te?  
SAI.Y: Unfortunately not. 
SA2.X: Excuse mel 
3.  THE TYPES OF RELATIONS BETWEEN SR-TRIADS 
In the general case the dialogue T-structure is 
descr ibed  by a sys tem of  SR- t r iads  wh ich  are  
connected  w i th  each  o ther  by the  re la t ions  o f  in ter -  
sect ion ,  imbedd ing  and  success ion .  
3 .1 .  Let  us cons ider  the  above  types  o f  the  
re la t ions  on examples  o f  d ia logues  w i th  a compl i -  
ca ted  T -s t ructure  wh ich  cons is ts  o f  two SR- t r iads .  
The in tersect ion  o f  SR- t r iads  represents  the  T-  
s t ructure  o f  a d ia logue  conta in ing  a mot ivated  
re fusa l  wh ich  i s  a negat ive  react ion  to  the  goa l  g .X

SA2.X i s  a pos i t ive  react ion  to  the  reason  w i th

SA2.Y i s  an  acceptance  o f  X ' s  react ion  to  the  
reason  by  Y (poss ib ly  by de fau l t ) .  
In  any  rea l  d ia logue  the  re fusa l  may be 
expressed  ind i rec t ly ,  i .e .  SAI .Y  conta ins  on ly  the  
reason  fo r  non-per forming  the  act ion  to  wh ich  Y i s

3 .2 .  More compl ica ted  d ia logue  T -s t ruc tures  
represent  combinat ions  of  the  above types  of  the  
re la t ions  between SR- t r iads .  These  d ia logues  inc lude  
in termed ia te  speech  acts :  each  SA in i t ia t ing  a 
subord inated  goa l  opens  an in termed ia te  SR- t r iad  
wh ich  compl ica tes  the  d ia logue  s t ruc ture .  Thus,  fo r  
example ,  in a d ia logue  the  speech  acts  o f  X, which 
are  connected  w i th  the  pr inc ipa l  goa l  in i t ia ted  by 
the  SAI .X,  may be de f ined  as " ins i s t ing"  or  
"persuad ing" .  Th is  i s  the  case  i f  Y "o f fe rs  res i s -

4.CONCLUSION 
The above SR- t r iad ,  be ing  t im bas ic  s t ruc tura l  
e lement  of  language in teract ion ,  re f lec ts  ti le in ter -  
connect ion  of SAs accord ing  to  the  type  of  t i le 
"s t imu lus - react ion"  re la t ion .  I t  i s  o f  spec ia l  
impor tance  fo r  us to  d i s t ingu ish  the  th i rd  phase  
which means that  the  pos i t i ve  or  negat ive  react ion  
of  a par t i c ipant  to  a cer ta in  goa l  in i t ia ted  by h i s  
par tner  becomes f ina l  on ly  a f te r  the  acceptance  
(approva l}  of  th i s  react ion  by the  in i t ia tor  of  the  
goa l .  I t  shou ld  be noted  that  even  a pos i t i ve  c lo -  
sure  of  g.X by Y does not  a lways  sat i s fy  X, e .g .  a 
prompt  agreement  i s  in terpreted  by X as thought less  
and insu f f i c ient ly  reasonab le .  
The acceptance  of  a react ion  by a d ia logue  
par t i c ipant  may happen at  d i f fe rent  leve ls  of  the  
in teract ion .  Thus i f  Y g ives  adv ice  to X 's  request  
?or an adv ice  ( there  are  no v io la t ions  a t  the  
communicative level) but tile content of tile advice 
(so-called extracommunicative information} does not 
satisfy X, then he looks in the content of the 
advice for the reason of initiating a further dis-- 
cussion. Tlle above offered apparatus for describing 
the dialogue T-structure with the use of additional 
means reflecting the character of a connection 
between the goals can, apparently, be applied for 
integral multilevel structural representation of LI. 
In the paper we have limited ourselves to the 
consideration of a dialogue (or a fragment of a 
dialogue} subordinated to one goal, its development, 
achievement or removal. However, except the dialogue 
connectedness with respect to goal, other types of 
SAs connectedness  in a d ia logue  may be d i scussed ,  
e .g .  a themat ic  one.  The dynamics  of the  deve lop-  
ment of  the  theme does  not  a lways  cor respond to the  
deve lopment  of  the  goa l .  The in t roduct ion  of  the  
not ion  of  the  theme and the  invest igat ion  of  i t s  
re la t ions  to  the  goa ls  w i l l  a l low us to  represent  a 
themat ic  s t ruc ture  to  accompany the  T -s t ruc ture  of  a 
d ia logue  or  to  be combined w i th  i t .
