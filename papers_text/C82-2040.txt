Data bases access  i s  typ ica l ly  approached as a prog~anm- 
ing  problem ra ther  than a user  in ter face  problem. Wez. conseq 
ent ly  see s i tuat ions  where only programmers can access  in form-  
a t ion  in  data  bases ,  in  sp i te  of  the fac t  that  the  people 
who need th i s  in fo rmat ion  are typ ica l ly  non-pro~'a~ners .  The 
most des i rab le  way to extend data  base access  capab i l i t i es  to 
na ive  user  popu la t ions  i s  by means of  a natura l  language in ter -  
face  or "front-end" system that can process requests stated in 
the user's natural language. PEARL is a domaln-lndependent 
system for  natura l  language ana lYs is  that  can be customized 
to handle domain -spec i f i c  quer ies  to ex i s t ing  data  bases .  
PEARL ana lyzes  Eng l i sh  input  w i th  expectat ion -dr iven  p~rs ing  
techn iques  end quest ion  answer ing s t ra te@les  developed by 
Ar t i f i c ia l  In te l l igence  researchers  (Lehner t ,  /1978/ ,  Sohank 
and Riesbeck /1976/ ,  Riesbeok /1975/ ,  Gershmsn /1979/ ,  B i rn -  
baum and Se l f r idge  /1979/ ,  and produces code in  whatever  query 
language i s  cur rent ly  be ing used to access  a spec i f i c  data  
base.  PEARL can there fore  be adapted to any data  base that  
has a query language access  module. 
In  any rea l i s t i c  app l i ca t ion  o f  natura l  language ana l -  
ys i s ,  we can expect  users  to  make mis takes ,  fo rget  to  spec i fy  
necessary  parameters ,  and use words that  are  not  in  the 
sys tem's  vocabu lary .  PEARL i s  des igned to handle these ine -  
v i tab le  occur rences  w i th  in teract ive  user  d ia logues  that

in  unres t r i c ted  Eng l i sh :  no const ra in ts  are  p laced  on the

The fo l low ing  examples o f  PEARL in  ac t ion  are taken 
from a vers ion  of  PEARL that  has been customized to handle 
requests  made by geo log is ts  to  a data  base conte /n ing  in form-

that can generate maps on the basis of information in the 
database. The map requests given be.low are h igh ly  domain-
