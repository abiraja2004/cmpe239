Abstract
Annotated corpora play a significant role in
many NLP applications. However, annota-
tion by humans is time-consuming and costly.
In this paper, a high recall predictor based
on a cost-sensitive learner is proposed as a
method to semi-automate the annotation of
unbalanced classes. We demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our approach in the context of
one form of unbalanced task: annotation of
transcribed human-human dialogues for pres-
ence/absence of uncertainty. In two data
sets, our cost-matrix based method of uncer-
tainty annotation achieved high levels of re-
call while maintaining acceptable levels of ac-
curacy. The method is able to reduce human
annotation effort by about 80% without a sig-
nificant loss in data quality, as demonstrated
by an extrinsic evaluation showing that results
originally achieved using manually-obtained
uncertainty annotations can be replicated us-
ing semi-automatically obtained uncertainty
annotations.
1 Introduction
Annotated corpora are crucial for the development
of statistical-based NLP tools. However, the annota-
tion of corpora is most commonly done by humans,
which is time-consuming and costly. To obtain a
higher quality annotated corpus, it is necessary to
spend more time and money on data annotation. For
this reason, one often has to accept some tradeoff
between data quality and human effort.
A significant proportion of corpora are unbal-
anced, where the distribution of class categories are
heavily skewed towards one or a few categories. Un-
balanced corpora are common in a number of dif-
ferent tasks, such as emotion detection (Ang et
al., 2002; Alm et al, 2005), sentiment classifica-
tion (Li et al, 2012), polarity of opinion (Carvalho
et al, 2011), uncertainty and correctness of student
answers in tutoring dialogue systems (Forbes-Riley
and Litman, 2011; Dzikovska et al, 2012), text
classification (Forman, 2003), information extrac-
tion (Hoffmann et al, 2011), and so on1.
In this paper, we present a semi-automated anno-
tation method that can reduce annotation effort for
the class of binary unbalanced corpora. Here is our
proposed annotation scheme: the first step is to build
a high-recall classifier with some initial annotated
data with an acceptable accuracy via a cost-sensitive
approach. The second step is to apply this classifier
to the rest of the unlabeled data, where the data are
then classified with positive or negative labels. The
last step is to manually check every positive label
and correct it if it is wrong.
To apply this method to work in practice, two re-
search questions have to be addressed. The first one
is how to get a high-recall classifier. High recall
means only a low proportion of true positives are
misclassified (false negatives). This property allows
for only positive labels to be corrected by human an-
notators in the third step, so that annotation effort
may be reduced. A related and separate research
question concerns the overall quality of data when
false negatives are not corrected: will a dataset anno-
tated with this method produce the same results as a

fully manually annotated version of the same dataset
when analyzed for substantive research questions?
In this paper, we will answer the two research
questions in the context of one form of binary un-
balanced task2: annotation of transcribed human-
human dialogue for presence/absence of uncertainty.
The contribution of this paper is twofold. First,
an extrinsic evaluation demonstrates the utility of
our approach, by showing that results originally
achieved using manually-obtained uncertainty anno-
tations can be replicated using semi-automatically
obtained uncertainty annotations. Second, a high
recall predictor based on a cost-sensitive learner is
proposed as a method to semi-automate the annota-
tion of unbalanced classes such as uncertainty.
2 Related Work
2.1 Reducing Annotation Effort
A number of semi-supervised learning methods have
been proposed in the literature for reducing annota-
tion effort, such as active learning (Cohn et al, 1994;
Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Zhu et al, 2010), co-training
(Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and self-training (Mihal-
cea, 2004). Active learning reduces annotation by
carefully selecting more useful samples. Co-training
relies on several conditional independent classifiers
to tag new unlabeled data and self-training takes
the advantage of full unlabeled data. These semi-
supervised learning methods demonstrate that with
a small proportion of annotated data, a classifier can
achieve comparable performance with all annotated
data. However, these approaches still need consid-
erable annotation effort when a large corpus has to
be annotated. In that case, all predicted labels have
to be rechecked by humans manually. In addition,
none of them take advantage of unbalanced data.
Another class of effort reduction techniques is
pre-annotation, which uses supervised machine-
learning systems to automatically assign labels to
the whole data and subsequently lets human anno-
tators correct them (Brants and Plaehn, 2000; Chiou
et al, 2001; Xue et al, 2002; Ganchev et al, 2007;
Chou et al, 2006; Rehbein et al, 2012).
Generally speaking, our annotation method be-
longs to the class of pre-annotation methods. How-
2This annotation scheme can also benefit other kinds of
tasks.
ever, our method improves pre-annotation for unbal-
anced data in two ways. Firstly, we lower the thresh-
old for achieving a high recall classifier. Secondly,
with pre-annotation, although people only perform
a binary decision of whether the automatic classifier
is either right or wrong, they have to go through all
the unlabeled data one by one. In contrast, in our
scheme, people go through only the positive predic-
tions, which are much less than the whole unlabeled
data, due to the unbalanced structure of the data.
What?s more, reducing the annotation effort is the
goal of this paper but not building a high recall clas-
sifier such as Prabhakaran et al (2012) and Ambati
et al (2010).
The approach proposed by Tetreault and
Chodorow (2008) is similar to us. However, they
assumed they had a high recall classifier but did not
explicitly show how to build it. In addition, they
did not provide extrinsic evaluation to see whether a
corpus generated by pre-annotation is good enough
to be used in real applications.
2.2 Uncertainty Prediction
Uncertainty is a lack of knowledge about internal
state (Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2011). In this paper,
we only focus on detection of uncertainty on text.
Commonly used features are lexical features such as
unigram (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011). More-
over, energy, dialogue features such as turn number,
tutor goal, and metadata like gender are also con-
sidered by Forbes-Riley and Litman (2011). Un-
certainty prediction is both substantively interesting
(Chan et al, 2012; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009)
and pragmatically expeditious for our purposes, due
to its binary classification and typical unbalanced
class structure.
CoNLL 2010 has launched a shared task to de-
tect hedges and their scope in natural language text
on two data sets: BioScope and Wikipedia (CoNLL,
2010). This first task to detect whether there is a
hedge present or not present in a sentence is very
similar to our uncertainty prediction task. 23 teams
participated in the shared task with the best re-
call of 0.8772 on the BioScope, and 0.5528 on the
Wikipedia. As we can see, uncertainty detection is
not trivial and it can be hard to get a high recall clas-
sifier.
In this paper, we focus on lexical features for our
9
purpose because lexical features are simple to ex-
tract and sufficient for our scheme. Even though
other features may improve uncertainty prediction
performance, with the goal of reducing annotation
effort, such lexical features are shown to be good
enough for our task.
3 The Corpora
We examine the following two data sets: the Mars
Exploration Rover (MER) mission (Tollinger et al,
2006; Paletz and Schunn, 2011) and the student
engineering team (Eng) dataset (Jang and Schunn,
2012). The MER scientists are evaluating data
downloaded from the Rover, discussing their work
process, and/or making plans for the Rovers. They
come from a large team of about 100+ scien-
tists/faculty, graduate students, and technicians. At
any one time, conversations are between 2-10 peo-
ple. The Eng teams are natural teams of college un-
dergraduates working on their semester-long prod-
uct design projects. The conversations involve 2-6
individuals. Audio and video are available for both
data sets and transcripts are obtained with human an-
notators.
Our task is to annotate the transcribed human-
human dialogues for presence/absence of uncer-
tainty in each utterance. There are 12,331 tran-
scribed utterances in the MER data set, and 44,199
transcribed utterances in the Eng data set. Both data
sets are unbalanced: in the MER data, 1641 of all
the 12,331 (13.3%) utterances are annotated as un-
certain by trained human annotators; in the Eng data,
only 1558 utterances are annotated, 221 of which are
annotated as uncertain (14.2%). 96.5% of the utter-
ances in the Eng data set have not been annotated
yet, raising the need for an efficient annotated tech-
nique. Both data sets are annotated by two trained
coders with high inter-rater agreement, at Cohen?s
kappa of 0.75 (Cohen, 1960). A sample dialogue
snippet from the MER corpus is shown in Table 1.
The last column indicates whether the utterance is
labeled as uncertainty or not: ?1? means uncertainty
and ?0? means certainty.
The MER data serves as the initial annotated set
and a high recall classifier will be trained on it; the
Eng data3 serves as a simulated unlabeled data set to

4 High Recall Classifier
4.1 Basic Classifier
The uncertainty prediction problem can be viewed
as a binary classification problem. It involves two
steps to build a high recall classifier for unbalanced
data. The first step is to build up a simple classifier;
the second step is to augment this classifier to favor
high recall.
Aiming for a simple classifier with high recall,
only some lexical words/phrases are used as fea-
tures here. There are several resources for the
words/phrases of uncertainty prediction. The main
resource is a guideline book used by our annotators
showing how to distinguish uncertainty utterance. It
gives three different kinds of words/phrases, shown
in Table 2 indicated by three superscripts ?+?, ?-?
and ?*?. The words/phrases with ?+? show some
evidence of uncertainty; ones with ?-? mean that
they show no evidence of uncertainty; others with
?*? may or may not show uncertainty. The second
source is from existing literature. The words/phrases
with ?1? are from (Hiraishi et al, 2000) and ones
with ?2? are from (Holms, 1999).
For each word/phrase w, a binary feature is used
to indicate whether the word/phrase w is in the ut-
terance or not.
A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the MER
data using these features and tested on the Eng data.
The performances of the model on the train set and
test set are shown in Table 3. Both weighted and un-
weighted false positive (FP) Rate, Precision, Recall
and F-Measure are reported. However, in later ex-
periments, we will focus on only the positive class
(the uncertainty class). A 0.689 recall means that
510 out of 1641 positive utterances are missed using
this model.

After error analysis, a few new words/phrases are
added to the feature set, shown in Table 4. By sup-
plementing the original feature set in this way, we
reran the training yielding our final baseline, the
performance on the training data (MER) and test-
ing data (Eng) is shown in Table 5. This time, we
compare different classifiers including Naive Bayes
(NB), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM). All of them are implemented using the
open source platform Weka (Hall et al, 2009) with
default parameters.
As we can see, test recall is worse than train recall.

FP is false positive
In addition, although DT and SVM perform better
than NB on train data set, they have similar perfor-
mance on the test set. Thus, the performance of the
baseline is not unacceptable, but neither is it stellar.
In advance, it is not hard to build such a model, since
only simple features and classifiers are used here.
4.2 Augmenting the Classifier using a Cost
Matrix
In our annotation framework, if the classifier
achieves 100% recall, the annotated data will be per-
fect because all the wrong predictions can be cor-
rected. That?s the reason why we are seeking for a
high recall classifier. A confusion matrix, is a com-
mon way to represent classifier performance. High
recall is indexed by a low false negative (FN) rate;
therefore, we aim to minimize FNs to achieve high
recall.
Following this idea, we employ a cost-sensitive
model, where the cost of FN is more than false pos-
itive (FP).
Following the same notation, we represent our
cost-sensitive classifier as a cost matrix. In our cost
matrix, classifying an actual class ?1? as ?1? costs
Ctp, an actual class ?0? as ?1? costs Cfp, an actual
class ?1? to ?0? costs Cfn, and ?0? to ?0? costs Ctn.
To achieve a high recall, Cfn should be more than
Cfp.
We can easily achieve 100% recall by classifying
all samples to ?1?, but this would defeat our goal of
reducing human annotation effort, since all utterance
uncertainty predictions would need to be manually
corrected. Thus, at the same time of a high recall,
we should also balance the total ratio of TP and FP.
In our experiment, Ctp and Ctn are set to 0 since
they are perfectly correct. Additionally, Cfp = 1 all
the time and Cfn changes with different scales. FPs

mean wrong predictions, but we can correct them
during the second pass to check them. However, we
cannot correct FNs without going through the whole
data set, so they are a more egregious detriment to
the quality of the annotated data. During the exper-
iment, Cfn varies from 1 to 20. With increases in
Cfn, the cost of FN increases compared to FP.
The cost-sensitive classifier is relying on Weka
with reweighting training instances. In this task,
SVM performed better than NB and DT. Only SVM
results are included here due to space constraint.
The test results are shown in Table 64. The last col-
umn in the two tables is the total proportion of pos-
itive predictions (FP + TP ). This value indicates
the total amount of data that humans have to check
in the second pass to verify whether positive predic-
tions are correct. To reduce human annotation effort,
we would like this value to be as low as possible.
As shown in Table 6, with the increase ofCfn, the
recall increases; however, the proportion of positive
predictions also increases. Therefore, it is a tradeoff
to achieve a high recall and a low ratio of TP and FP.
For the test set, the recall increases with larger
Cfn, even with a small increase of Cfn from 1 to
3. Remarkably, the classifier gives us a high recall
while keeping the proportion of positive predictions
at an acceptably low level. When Cfn = 20 for the
test set, only 20.7% of the data need to be manually
checked by humans, and less than 10% uncertain ut-
terances (19 out of 221 for the Eng data) are missed.
Now, we have achieved a high recall classifier
with an acceptable ratio of positive predictions.
5 Extrinsic Evaluation of Semi-Automated
Annotation
Even with a high recall classifier, some of the true
positive data are labeled incorrectly in the final an-

notated corpus. In addition, it also changes the dis-
tribution of class labels.
To test whether it hurts the overall data quality,
we performed an analysis, which demonstrates that
this annotation scheme is sufficient to produce qual-
ity data. We attempted to replicate an analysis on the
Eng data set, which examines the use of analogy, a
cognitive strategy where a source and target knowl-
edge structure are compared in terms of structural
correspondences as a strategy for solving problems
under uncertainty. The analysis we attempt to repli-
cate here focuses on examining how uncertainty lev-
els change relative to baseline before, during, and
after the use of analogies.
The overall Eng transcripts were segmented into
one of 5 block types: 1) pre-analogy (Lag -1) blocks,
10 utterances just prior to an analogy episode, 2)
during-analogy (Lag 0) blocks, utterances from the
beginning to end of an analogy episode, 3) post-
analogy (Lag 1) blocks, 10 utterances immediately
following an analogy episode, 4) post-post-analogy
(Lag 2) blocks, 10 utterances immediately follow-
ing post-analogy utterances, and 5) baseline blocks,
each block of 10 utterances at least 25 utterances
away from the other block types. The measure of un-
certainty in each block was the proportion of uncer-
tain utterances. The sampling strategy for the base-
line blocks was designed to provide an estimate of
uncertainty levels when the speakers were engaged
in pre-analogy, during-analogy, or post-analogy con-
versation, with the logic being that a certain amount
of lag or spillover of uncertainty was assumed to
take place surrounding analogy episodes.
Figure 1 shows the relationship of block type to
mean levels of uncertainty, comparing the pattern
with human vs. classifier-supported uncertainty la-
bels. The classifier-generated labels were first pre-
processed such that all FPs were removed, but FNs
remain. This re-analysis comparison thus provides
a test of whether the recall rate is high enough that
known statistical effects are not substantially altered
or removed. To examine how different settings of
Cfn might impact overall performance, we used la-
bels (corrected for false positives) for 4 different lev-
els of Cfn (1, 5, 10, 20) from the Table 6.
In the Eng data analyses, the main findings were
that analogy was triggered by local spikes in un-
certainty levels (Lag -1 > baseline), replicating re-

sults from prior work with the MER dataset (Chan
et al, 2012); in contrast to the findings in MER,
uncertainty did not reduce to baseline levels follow-
ing analogy (Lags 1 and 2 > baseline). Figure 1
plots the relationship of block type to mean levels
of uncertainty in this data set, comparing the pat-
tern with human vs. classifier-generated uncertainty
labels. Table 7 shows the standardized mean differ-
ence (Cohen?s d) (Cohen, 1988) from baseline by
block type and label source. The pattern of effects
(Lag -1 > baseline, Lags 1 and 2 > baseline) re-
mains substantially unchanged with the exception of
the Lag 2 vs. baseline comparison falling short of
statistical significance (although note that the stan-
dardized mean difference remains very similar) for
Cfn ranging from 20 to 5, although we can observe
a noticeable attenuation of effect sizes from Cfn of
5 and below, and a loss of statistical significance
for the main effect of uncertainty being significantly
higher than baseline for Lag -1 blocks when Cfn =
1.
The re-analysis clearly demonstrates that the re-
call rate of the classifier is sufficient to not substan-
tially alter or miss known statistical effects. We can
reasonably extrapolate that using this classifier for
uncertainty annotation in other datasets should be
satisfactory.
6 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, a simple high recall classifier is pro-
posed based on a cost matrix to semi-automate the
annotation of corpora with unbalanced classes. This
classifier maintains a good balance between high re-
call and high FP and NP ratio. In this way, humans
can employ this classifier to annotate new data with
significantly reduced effort (approximately 80% less
effort, depending on the degree of imbalance in the
data). Although the classifier does introduce some
misclassified samples to the final annotation, an ex-
trinsic evaluation demonstrates that the recall rate is
high enough and the performance does not sacrifice
data quality.
Like other semi-supervised or supervised meth-
ods for supporting annotation, our annotation
scheme has some limitations that should be noted.
Firstly, an initial annotated data set is needed to de-
rive a good performance classifier and the amount
of annotated data is dependent on the specific task5.
Secondly, the features and machine learning algo-
rithms used in semi-supervised annotation are also
domain specific. At the same time, there are some
unique challenges and opportunities that can be fur-
ther investigated for our annotation scheme on un-
balanced data. For example, even though the cost
matrix method can achieve a high recall for binary
classification problem, whether it can be generalized
to other tasks (e.g., multi-class classification tasks)
is an unanswered question. Another open question
is how the degree of unbalance between classes in
the corpora affects overall annotation quality. We
suggest that if the data is not unbalanced, the total
amount of effort that can be reduced will be lower.
