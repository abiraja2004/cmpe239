Abstract 
The rapid development of language tools 
using machine learning techniques for less 
computerized languages requires appropri-
ately tagged corpus. A Bengali news cor-
pus has been developed from the web ar-
chive of a widely read Bengali newspaper. 
A web crawler retrieves the web pages in 
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 
format from the news archive. At present, 
the corpus contains approximately 34 mil-
lion wordforms. The date, location, re-
porter and agency tags present in the web 
pages have been automatically named en-
tity (NE) tagged. A portion of this partially 
NE tagged corpus has been manually anno-
tated with the sixteen NE tags with the help 
of Sanchay Editor1, a text editor for Indian 
languages. This NE tagged corpus contains 
150K wordforms. Additionally, 30K word-
forms have been manually annotated with 
the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP-
08 NER Shared Task for South and South 
East Asian Languages 2 . A table driven 
semi-automatic NE tag conversion routine 
has been developed in order to convert the 
sixteen-NE tagged corpus to the twelve-NE 
tagged corpus. The 150K NE tagged cor-
pus has been used to develop Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) system in Bengali us-
ing pattern directed shallow parsing ap-

tional Random Field (CRF) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental re-
sults of the 10-fold cross validation test 
have demonstrated that the SVM based 
NER system performs the best with an 
overall F-Score of 91.8%. 
1 Introduction 
The mode of language technology work has been 
changed dramatically since the last few years with 
the web being used as a data source in a wide 
range of research activities. The web is anarchic, 
and its use is not in the familiar territory of compu-
tational linguistics. The web walked into the ACL 
meetings started in 1999. The use of the web as a 
corpus for teaching and research on language tech-
nology has been proposed a number of times 
(Rundel, 2000; Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; 
Fletcher, 2003). There is a long history of creating 
a standard for western language resources. The 
human language technology (HLT) society in 
Europe has been particularly zealous for the stan-
dardization, making a series of attempts such as 
EAGLES3, PROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al, 2000), 
ISLE/MILE (Calzolari et al, 2003; Bertagna et al, 
2004) and more recently multilingual lexical data-
base generation from parallel texts in 20 European 
languages (Giguet and Luquet, 2006). On the other 
hand, in spite of having great linguistic and cul-
tural diversities, Asian language resources have 
received much less attention than their western 
counterparts. A new project (Takenobou et al, 
2006) has been started to create a common stan-
dard for Asian language resources. They have ex-
tended an existing description framework, the

MILE (Bertagna et al, 2004), to describe several 
lexical entries of Japanese, Chinese and Thai. India 
is a multilingual country with the enormous cul-
tural diversities. (Bharati et al, 2001) reports on 
efforts to create lexical resources such as transfer 
lexicon and grammar from English to several In-
dian languages and dependency tree bank of anno-
tated corpora for several Indian languages. Corpus 
development work from web can be found in (Ek-
bal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) for Bengali. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the 
core components in most Information Extraction 
(IE) and Text Mining systems. During the last few 
years, the probabilistic machine learning methods 
have become state of the art for NER (Bikel et al, 
1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002) and for field extraction 
(McCallum et al, 2000). Most prominently, Hid-
den Markov Models (HMMs) have been used for 
the information extraction task (Bikel et al, 1999). 
Beside HMM, there are other systems based on 
Support Vector Machine (Sun et al, 2003) and 
Na?ve Bayes (De Sitter and Daelemans, 2003). 
Maximum Entropy (ME) conditional models like 
ME Markov models (McCallum et al, 2000) and 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 
2001) were reported to outperform the generative 
HMM models on several IE tasks.  
The existing works in the area of NER are 
mostly in non-Indian languages. There has been a 
very little work in the area of NER in Indian lan-
guages (ILs). In ILs, particularly in Bengali, the 
work in NER can be found in (Ekbal and 
Bandyopadhyay, 2007a; Ekbal and Bandyop-
adhyay, 2007b; Ekbal et al, 2007c). Other than 
Bengali, the work on NER can be found in (Li and 
McCallum, 2003) for Hindi. 
Newspaper is a huge source of readily available 
documents. In the present work, the corpus has 
been developed from the web archive of a very 
well known and widely read Bengali newspaper. 
Bengali is the seventh popular language in the 
world, second in India and the national language of 
Bangladesh. A code conversion routine has been 
written that converts the proprietary codes used in 
the newspaper into the standard Indian Script Code 
for Information Interchange (ISCII) form, which 
can be processed for various tasks. A separate code 
conversion routine has been developed for convert-
ing ISCII codes to UTF-8 codes. A portion of this 
corpus has been manually annotated with the six-
teen NE tags as described in Table 3. Another por-
tion of the corpus has been manually annotated 
with the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP-08 
NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian 
Languages. A table driven semi-automatic NE tag 
conversion routine has been developed in order to 
convert this corpus to a form tagged with the 
twelve NE tags. The NE tagged corpus has been 
used to develop Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
system in Bengali using pattern directed shallow 
parsing approach, HMM, ME, CRF and SVM 
frameworks.  
A number of detailed experiments have been 
conducted to identify the best set of features for 
NER in Bengali. The ME, CRF and SVM based 
NER models make use of the language independ-
ent as well as language dependent features. The 
language independent features could be applicable 
for NER in other Indian languages also. The sys-
tem has demonstrated the highest F-Score value of 
91.8% with the SVM framework. One possible 
reason behind its best performance may be the 
flexibility of the SVM framework to handle the 
morphologically rich Indian languages.    
2 Development of the Named Entity 
Tagged Bengali News Corpus  
2.1 Language Resource Acquisition 
A web crawler has been developed that retrieves 
the web pages in Hyper Text Markup Language 
(HTML) format from the news archive of a leading 
Bengali newspaper within a range of dates 
provided as input. The crawler generates the 
Universal Resource Locator (URL) address for the 
index (first) page of any particular date. The index 
page contains actual news page links and links to 
some other pages (e.g., Advertisement, TV 
schedule, Tender, Comics and Weather etc.) that 
do not contribute to the corpus generation. The 
HTML files that contain news documents are 
identified and the rest of the HTML files are not 
considered further. 
2.2 Language Resource Creation 
The HTML files that contain news documents are 
identified by the web crawler and require cleaning 
to extract the Bengali text to be stored in the 
corpus along with relevant details. The HTML file 
is scanned from the beginning to look for tags like 
<fontFACE=BENGALI_FONT_NAME>...<font>, 
where the BENGALI_FONT_NAME is the name 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
2
of one of the Bengali font faces as defined in the 
news archive. The Bengali text enclosed within 
font tags are retrieved and stored in the database 
after appropriate tagging. Pictures, captions and 
tables may exist anywhere within the actual news. 
Tables are integral part of the news item. The 
pictures, its captions and other HTML tags that are 
not relevant to our text processing tasks are 
discarded during the file cleaning. The Bengali 
news corpus has been developed in both ISCII and 
UTF-8 codes.  The tagged news corpus contains 
108,305 number of news documents with about 
five (5) years (2001-2005) of news data collection. 
Some statistics about the tagged news corpus are 
presented in Table 1.

2.3 Language Resource Annotation 
The Bengali news corpus collected from the web is 
annotated using a tagset that includes the type and 
subtype of the news, title, date, reporter or agency 
name, news location and the body of the news. A 
part of this corpus is then tagged with a tagset, 
consisting of sixteen NE tags and one non-NE tag.  
Also, a part of the corpus has been tagged with a 
tagest of twelve NE tags4, defined for the IJCNLP-
08 NER Shared Task for South and South East 
Asian Languages. 
A news corpus, whether in Bengali or in any 
other language, has different parts like title, date, 
reporter, location, body etc. To identify these parts 
in a news corpus the tagset, described in Table 2, 
has been defined. The reporter, agency, location, 
date, bd, day and ed tags help to recognize the 
person name, organization name, location name 
                                                 
4http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=3 
and the various date expressions that appear in the 
fixed places of the newspaper. These tags are not 
able to recognize the various NEs that appear 
within the actual news body. 
In order to identify NEs within the actual news 
body, we have defined a tagset consisting of 
seventeen tags. We have considered the major four 
NE classes, namely ?Person name?, ?Location 
name?, ?Organization name? and ?Miscellaneous 
name?. Miscellaneous names include the date, 
time, number, percentage and monetary 
expressions. The four major NE classes are further 
divided in order to properly denote each 
component of the multiword NEs. The NE tagset is 
shown in Table 3 with the appropriate examples. 
We have also tagged a portion of the corpus as 
part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South 
and South East Asian Languages. This tagset has 
twelve different tags. The underlying reason for 
adopting these tags was the necessity of a slightly 
finer tagset for various natural language processing 
(NLP) applications and particularly for machine 
translation. The IJCNLP-08 NER shared task 
tagset is shown in Table 4.      
One important aspect of IJCNLP-08 NER 
shared task was to annotate only the maximal NEs 
and not the structures of the entities. For example, 
mahatma gandhi road is annotated as location and 
assigned the tag ?NEL? even if  mahatma and gan-
dhi are NE title person and person name, respec-
tively, according to the IJCNLP-08 shared task 
tagset. These internal structures of the entities need 
to be identified during testing. So, mahatma gan-
dhi road will be tagged as mahatma/NETP gan-
dhi/NEP road/NEL. The structure of the tagged 
element using the Shakti Standard Format (SSF)5 
will be as follows: 
1 (( NP <ne=NEL>  
1.1 (( NP <ne=NEP> 
1.1.1 (( NP  <ne=NETP> 
1.1.1.1 mahatma 
)) 
1.1.2 gandhi 
)) 
1.2 road 
))

2.4 Partially Tagged News Corpus Develop-
ment 
A news document is stored in the corpus in XML 
format using the tagset, mentioned in Table 2. In 
the HTML news file, the date is stored at first and 
is divided into three parts. The first one is the date 
according to Bengali calendar, second one is the 
day in Bengali and the last one is the date accord-
ing to English calendar. Both Bengali and English 
dates are stored in the form ?day month year?.  
A sequence of four Bengali digits separates the 
Bengali date from the Bengali day. The English 
date starts with one/two digits in Bengali font. 
Bengali date, day and English date can be distin-
guished by checking the appearance of the numer-
als and these are tagged as <bd>, <day> and <ed>, 
respectively. For e.g., 25 sraban 1412  budhbar  10 
august 2005 is tagged as shown in Table 5.

2.5 Named Entity Tagged Corpus 
Development 
The partially NE tagged corpus contains 34 
million wordforms and are in both ISCII and UTF-
8 forms. A portion of this corpus, containing 150K 
wordforms, has been manually annotated with the 
sixteen NE tags that are listed in Table 3. The 
corpus has been annotated with the help of 
Sanchay Editor, a text editor for Indian languages. 
The detailed statistics of this NE-tagged corpus are 
given in Table 6. The corpus is in SSF form, 
which has the following structure: 
 
 
 
<Story id=""> 
<Sentence id=""> 
1 biganni NNE  
2 newton PER 
3 .  
</Sentence id=""> 
 .  
</Story id=""> 
 
Another portion of the partially NE tagged 
Bengali news corpus has been manually annotated 
as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task with 
the twelve NE tags, as listed in Table 4. The 
annotation process has been very difficult due to 
the presence of a number of ambiguous NE tags. 
The potential ambiguous NE tags are: NED vs 
NETP, NEO vs NEB, NETE vs NETO, NETO vs 
NETP and NEN vs NEM. For example, it is 
difficult to decide whether ?Agriculture? is 
?NETE?, and if no then whether ?Horticulture? is 
?NETE? or not. In fact, this the most difficult class 
to identify. This NE tagged corpus contains 
approximately 30K wordforms. Details statistics 
of this tagged corpus are shown in Table 7. This 
NE tagged corpus is in the following SSF form.

2.6 Tag Conversion 
A tag conversion routine has been developed in 
order to convert the sixteen-NE tagged corpus of 
150K wordforms to the corpus, tagged with the 
IJCNLP-08 twelve-NE tags. This conversion is a 
semi-automatic process. Some of our sixteen NE 
tags can be automatically mapped to some of the 
IJCNLP-08 shared task tags. The tags that repre-
sent person, location and organization names can 
be directly mapped to the NEP, NEL and NEO 
tags, respectively. Other IJCNLP-08 shared task 
tags can be obtained with the help of gazetteer lists 
and simple heuristics. In our earlier NER experi-
ments, we have already developed a number of 
gazetteer lists such as: lists of person, location and 
organization names; list of prefix words (e.g., sree, 
sriman etc.) that predict the left boundary of a per-
son name; list of designation words (e.g., mantri, 
sangsad etc.) that helps to identify person names. 
The lists of prefix and designation words are help-
ful to find the NETP and NED tags. The sixteen-
NE tagged corpus is searched for the person name 
tags and the previous word is matched against the 
lists of prefix and designation words. The previous 
word is tagged as NED or NETP if there is a 
match with the lists of designation words and pre-
fix words, respectively. The NEN and NETI tags 
can be obtained by looking at our miscellaneous 
tags and using some simple heuristics. The NEN 
tags can be simply obtained by checking whether 
the MISC tagged element consists of digits only. 
The lists of cardinal and ordinal numbers have 
been also kept to recognize NETI tags. A list of 
words that denote the measurements (e.g., kilo-
gram, taka, dollar etc.) has been kept in order to 
get the NEM tag. The lists of words, denoting the 
brand names, title-objects and terms, have been 
prepared to get the NEB, NETO and NETE tags. 
The NEA tags can be obtained with the help of a 
gazetteer list and using some simple heuristics 
(whether the word contains the dot and there is no 
space between the characters). The mapping from 
our NE tagset to the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task 
tagset is shown in Table 8. 
3 Use of Language Resources 
The NE tagged news corpus, developed in this 
work, has been used to develop the Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) systems in Bengali using pat-
tern directed shallow parsing, HMM, ME, CRF 
and SVM frameworks.

We have considered the sixteen NE tags to de-
velop these systems. Named entity recognition in 
Indian Languages (ILs) in general and particularly 
in Bengali is difficult and challenging as there is 
no concept of capitalization in ILs. 
The Bengali NER systems that use pattern di-
rected shallow parsing approach can be found in 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
6
(Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a) and (Ekbal 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b). An HMM-based 
Bengali NER system can be found in (Ekbal and 
Bandyopadhyay, 2007c). These systems have been 
trained and tested with the corpus tagged with the 
sixteen NE tags.  
A number of experiments have been conducted 
in order to find out the best feature set for NER in 
Bengali using the ME, CRF and SVM frameworks. 
In all these experiments, we have used a number of 
gazetteer lists such as: first names (72, 206 en-
tries), middle names (1,491 entries) and sur names 
(5,288 entries) of persons; prefix (245 entries) and 
designation words (947 entries) that help to detect 
person names; suffixes (45 and 23 entries) that 
help to identify person and location names; clue 
words (94 entries) that help to detect organization 
names; location name (7, 870 entries) and organi-
zation name (2,225 entries). Apart from these gaz-
etteer lists, we have used the prefix and suffix 
(may not be linguistically meaningful suf-
fix/prefix) features, digit features, first word fea-
ture and part of speech information of the words 
etc. We have used the C++ based Maximum En-
tropy package6, C++ based OpenNLP CRF++ pack-
age7 and open source YamCha8 tool for ME based 
NER, CRF based NER and SVM based NER, re-
spectively. For SVM based NER system, we have 
used TinySVM 9  classifier, pair wise multi-class 
decision method and the second-degree polynomial 
kernel function. The brief descriptions of all the 
models are given below: 
?A: Pattern directed shallow parsing approach 
without linguistic knowledge. 
?B: Pattern directed shallow parsing approach with 
linguistic knowledge. 
?HMM based NER: Trigram model with additional 
context dependency, NE suffix lists for handling 
unknown words. 
?ME based NER: Contextual window of size three 
(current, previous and the next word), prefix and 
suffix of length upto three of the current word, 
POS information of the current word, NE informa-
tion of the previous word (dynamic feature), dif-
ferent digit features and the various gazetteer liststs.

?CRF based NER: Contextual window of size five 
(current, previous two words and the next two 
words), prefix and suffix of length upto three of the 
current word, POS information of window three 
(current word, previous word and the next word), 
NE information of the previous word (dynamic 
feature), different digit features and the various 
gazetteer lists. 
?SVM based NER: Contextual window of size six 
(current, previous three words and the next two 
words), prefix and suffix of length upto three of the 
current word, POS information of window three 
(current word, previous word and the next word), 
NE information of the previous two words (dy-
namic feature), different digit features and the vari-
ous gazetteer lists. 
Evaluation results of the 10-fold cross validation 
test for all the models are presented in Table 9. 
Evaluation results clearly show that the SVM 
based NER model outperforms other models due to 
it?s efficiency to handle the non-independent, di-
verse and overlapping features of Bengali lan-
guage.

4 Conclusion 
In this work we have developed a Bengali news 
corpus of approximately 34 million wordforms 
from the web archive of a leading Bengali newspa-
per. The date, location, reporter and agency tags 
present in the web pages have been automatically 
NE tagged. Around 150K wordforms of this par-
tially NE tagged corpus has been manually anno-
tated with the sixteen NE tags. We have also 
tagged around 30K wordforms with the twelve NE 
tags, defined for the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task. 
A tag conversion routine has also been developed 
in order to convert any sixteen-NE tagged corpus 
to the twelve-NE tagged corpus.  The sixteen-NE 
tagged corpus of 150K wordforms has been used to

develop the NER systems using various machine-
learning approaches. 
This NE tagged corpus can be used for other 
NLP research activities such as machine 
translation, information retrieval, cross-lingual 
event tracking, automatic summarization etc.
