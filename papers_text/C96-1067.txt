Abstract 
We argue that the conventional pproach 
to Interactive Machine ~Ih-anslation is not 
the best way to provide assistance to 
skilled translators, and propose an alter- 
native whose central feature is the use 
of the target text as a medium of inter- 
action. We describe an automatic word- 
completion system intended to serve as a 
vehicle for exploring the feasibility of this 
new approach, and give results in terms 
of keystrokes aved in a test corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Machine translation is usually significantly infe- 
rior to human translation, and for most appli- 
cations where high-quality results are needed it 
must be used in conjunction with a human trans- 
lator. There are essentially three ways of organiz- 
ing the process by which a person and a machine 
cooperate to produce a translation: prccdition, in 
which the person's contribution takes the form of 
a source-text analysis and occurs before the MT 
system is brought to bear; postedition, in which 
the translator simply edits the system's output; 
and interactive MT (IMT), which involves a di- 
alog between person and machine. Of the three, 
IMT is the most ambitious and theoretically the 
most powerflfl. It has a potential advantage over 
postedition in that information imparted to the 
system may help it to avoid cascading errors that 
would later require much greater effort to correct; 
and it has a potential advantage over preedition 
in that knowledge of the machine's current state 
may be useful in reducing the number of analyses 
the human is required to provide. 
Existing approaches to IMT (Blanchon, 1994; 
Boitet, 1990; Brown and Nirenburg, 1990; Kay, 
1973; Maruyama nd Watanabe, 1990; Whitelock 
et al, 1986; Zajac, 1988) place the MT system 
in control of the translation process and for the 
most part limit the human's role to performing 
various source language disambiguations on de- 
man& Although this arrangement is appropriate 
for some applications, notably those in which the 
user's knowledge of tile target language may be 
limited, or where there are multiple target, lan- 
guages, it is not well suited to tile needs of pro- 
fessional oi' other highly skilled translators. The 
lack of direct human control over the tinal target 
text (modulo postedition) is a serious drawback 
in this case, and it is not clear that, for a com- 
petent translator, disambiguat, ing a source text, is 
much easier than translating it. This conclusion 
is supported by the fact that true IMT is not, 
to our knowledge, used in most modern transla- 
tor's support environments, eg (Eurolang, 1995; 
I,'rederking et al, 1993; IBM, 1995; Kugler et al, 
1991; Nirenburg, 1992; ~li'ados, 1995). Such envi- 
ronments, when they incorporate MT at all, tend 
to do so wholesale, giving the user control over 
whether and when an MT component is invoked, 
as well as extensive postediting facilities for mod- 
ifying its outtmt, but not the ability to intervene 
while it is operating. 
In our view, this state of affairs should not be 
taken as evidence that IMT for skilled translators 
is an inherently bad idea. We feel that there is 
an alternate approach which has the potential to 
avoid most of the problems with conventional IMT 
in this context,: use the target ext as a medium of 
communication, and have the translator and MT 
system interact by making changes and extensions 
to it, with the translator's contributions serving as 
progressively informative constraints for the sys- 
te,n. This arrangement has the advantage of leav- 
ing the translator in full control of the translation 
process, of diverting his or her attention very lit- 
tle from the object of its natural focus, and of ne- 
cessitating a minimum of interface paraphernalia 
beyond those of a word processor. It can in prin- 
ciple accomodate a wide range of MT proficien- 
394 
cies, frolil very high, in which the system inight 
be called ut)on to propose entire translations and 
Inoditly them in response to changes Inade by the 
translator; to very low, in which its chief contri- 
l)ution will be the reduction of typing labour. 
The aim of this paper ix to explore the feasi- 
bility of this target-tezt mediated style of IMT in 
one parti(:ularly simph; form: a word-(:onq)h',tion 
system which ai;temltts to fill in the sutlixes of 
target-text words from manually typed prefixes.t 
We describe a prototype completion system for 
English to l~?ench translation which is based on 
simple statistical MT techniques, att(t give mea- 
StlFenlents el: its performance ill terms of (;}larac- 
ters saved in a test cortms. The system has not 
yet been integrated with a word processor, st) we 
(;annot qltantify the anlollnt of a(:tual time and 
(;fl'ort it woul(t save a translator, t)nt it seems rea- 
sonable to expect this to lie faMy well correlated 
with total character savings. 
2 Word Complet ion  
Our scenm'io for wor(1 completion SUl)t)oses that 
a translator works on some designated segment of 
the source text (of attproxinmtely sentence size), 
and elaborates its (;ranslation from left to right. 
As each target-text character is tylted , a t)rot)osed 
(:omttletion for tit(; currenl; word is (tisttlayed; if 
this is (',orreet, the translator ntay a(',cept it att(l 
l)cgin typing the next word. Although inore elab- 
orate comi)lel;ion schemes are imaginable, in(:lud- 
ing ones that involve the use, of alternate hyI)othe- 
sos or 1)revisions for morl)hologieal repair, we have 
ot)ted against these for the time t)eing because 
they necessitate st)eeial commands whose benetit 
in terms of characters saved would t)e diilicult to 
estimate. 
The heart of ore" system is a comltletion engine 
for English to t~'ench translation which finds the 
best completion for a \[,?eneh word prefix given the 
current English source text segment utnler trans- 
lation, attd the words which precede the prefix 
in the corresponding l~?eneh target text segment. 
It comprises two main components: an cvalua- 
tot which assigns cores to completion hypotheses, 
and a generator which produces a list of hyp(tthe- 
sos that match the current prefix and picks the 
one with the highest score. 
1This idea is similm to existing work on tyl)ing 
ae(:elerators for the disabled (Demasco and McCoy, 
1992), but our methods differ signitieantly in many 
aspects, chief among which is the use of bilingual 
context. 
3 Hypothes is  Eva luat ion  
Each score produced by the evaluator is an es- 
tilnate of p(tl{, st, the probability of a target.- 
language word t given a preceding target text t, 
anti a source text s. For etticiency, this distribu- 
tion is modeled as a silnple linear combination of 
SOl)re'ate tn'edietions fl'om tit(; target text and the 
sottree text: 
p(tlE, s) = Ap(tl{ ) + (1-  A)p(tls ). 
The vahte of /~ was chosen so as to maximize 
e, otnpletion lterforInanee over a test text; (see s(!c- 
tion 5). 
3.1 Target -Text  Based  Pred ic t ion  
The target-text based prediction p(t l t )  comes 
t?om an interpolated trigranl language model for 
l%:ench, of the type commonly used in speech 
recognition (Jelinek, 11!190). It; was trained on 47M 
words fiom the Canadian Hansard Corpus, with 
750/o used to make relative-fl'equency I)arameter 
estintates and 25% used to reestimate interpola- 
tion coefticients. 
3.2 Source-Text  Based  Pred ic t ion  
The source text prediction p(t\[s) comes fl'om a 
statistical model of English-to-l,?ench translation 
which is based on the IBM translation models 1 
and 2 (Brown el; al., 1993). Model 1 is a Hid.- 
den Markov Model (HMM) of the target language 
whose states correspond to source text tokens (see 
figure l), with the addition of one special null 
state to account for target ext words that have no 
strong direct correlation to any word in the source 
text. The output distribution of any state tie the 
set of probabilities with which it generates target 
words) deitends only on the correspondit~g source 
text word, and all next-state transition distribu- 
tions are uniform. Model 2 is similar to model 1 
except that states are attgmented with a target- 
token t)osition cotnponent, attd transition proba- 
bilities depend on both source and target token 
positions, '2with the topographical constraint that 
a state's target-token t)ositioll component must 
always match the current actual position. Be- 
cause of the restricted form of the state transition 
UAlong with source and target text lengths in 
l/town et als fornmlation, lint these are  constant for 
arty particular HMM. The results 1)resented in this pa- 
lter are optimistic in that the target text lengl;h was 
assumed to be known in advance, which of course is 
unrealistic. IIowever, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown 
that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to 
the model's i)ertbrmanee.

Figure 1: A plausible state sequence by which the HMM corresponding to the English sentence I have other 
cxamples from many other countries might generate the French sentence shown. The state-transition probabilities 
(horizontal arrows) are all 1/9 for model 1, and depend on the next state for model 2, eg p((froms, 6} I') = a(516). 
The output probabilities (vertical arrows) depend on the words involved, eg p(d' I {from~, 6}) = p(d' I from ). 
matrices for these models, they have the prop- 
erty that- unlike HMM's in general they gen- 
erate target-language words independently. The 
probability of generating hypothesis t at position 
i is just: 
Isl 
p(tls, i ) = EP( t l s i )a ( j  li) 
j=0  
where sj is the j th  source text token (so is a 
null token), p(t ls j)  is a word-for-word transla- 
tion probability, and a( j l i  ) is a position align- 
ment probability (equal to 1/( M + 1) for inodel 
1). 
We introduced a simple enhancement to the 
IBM models designed to extend their coverage, and 
make them more compact. It is based on the ob- 
servation that there are (at least) three classes 
of English forms which most often translate into 
Fk'ench either verbatim or via a predictable trans- 
formation: proper nouns, numbers, and special 
atphanuineric codes such as C-~5. We found that 
we could reliably detect such "invariant" forms in 
an English source text using a statistical tagger 
to identify proper nouns, and regular expressions 
to match immbers and codes, along with a filter 
for frequent names like United States that do not 
translate verbatim into French and Immbers like 
10 that tend to get translated into a fairly wide 
variety of forms. 
When the translation models were trained, in- 
variant okens in each source text segment were re- 
placed by special tags specific to each class (differ- 
ent invariants occuring in the same segment were 
assigned serial numbers to distinguish them); any 
instances of these tokens found in the correspond- 
ing target text segment were also replace(\] by the 
appropriate tag. This strategy reduced the nmn- 
ber of parameters in the inodels by about 15%. 
When ewfluating hypotheses, a siufilar replace- 
ment operation is carried out and the transla- 
tion probabilities of paired invariants are obtained 
from those of the tags to which they map. 
Parameters for the translation models were 
reestimated fl'om the Hansard corpus, automat- 
ically aligned to the sentence level using the 
method described in (Simard et al, 1992), with 
non one-to-one aliglmmnts arid sentences longer 
than 50 words filtered out; the ret~fine(l material 
consisted of 36M English words and 37M Fren(:h 
words. 
4 Hypothes is  Generat ion  
The main challenge in generating hypotheses i 1;o 
balance the opposing requirements of completion 
accuracy and speed the former tends to increase, 
and tile latter to decrease with tile nmnber of hy- 
potheses considered. We took a number of steps 
in art effort to achieve a good compromise. 
4.1 Act ive  and  Pass ive  Vocabu lar ies  
A well-established corollary to Zipf's law holds 
that a minority of words account for a majority 
of tokens in text. To capitalize on this, our sys- 
tem's French  vocabulary is divided i n to  two  parts: 
a small active component whose contents are al- 
ways used for generation, and a much larger pas- 
sive part which comes into play only when the 
active vocabulary contains no extensions to the 
(:urrent )refix. 
Space requirements for the passive vocabulary 
were minimized by storing it as a special trie 
in which con ln lon  Srl\[~cix patterns are represented 
only once, and variable-length coding techniques 
are used for structural information. This allows 
us to maintain a large dictionary containing over 
380,000 forms entirely in memory, using about 
475k bytes. 
The active vocabulary is also represented as a 
trie. For efficiency, explicit lists of hypotheses at'(; 
not generated; instead, evaluation is performed 
during a reeursive search over the portion of the 
trie below the current coinpletion prefix. Repeat 
searches when the prefix is extended by one char- 
acter are ol)viated in inost situations by memo\]z- 
ing the results of tile original search with a best- 
child pointer in each trie node (see figure 2). 
4.2 Dynamic  Vocabu lary  
To set the contents of the active vocabulary, we 
borrowed the idea of a dynamic vocabulary from 
(Brousseau et al, 1995). This involves using

but all punctuation must be manually typed, and 
any spaces or punctuation characters in hand- 
typed prefixes are assessed a one-keystroke escape 
penalty. 
Figure 4 shows the performance of the system 
for various values of the trigram coefficient A. A 
noteworthy feature of this graph is that interpola- 
tion improves performance over the pure trigram 
by only about 3%. This is due in large part to the 
fact that the translation model has already made a 
contribution in non-linear fashion through the dy- 
namic vocabulary, which excludes many hypothe- 
ses that might otherwise have misled the language 
model. 
Another interesting characteristic of the data is 
the discrepancy between the number of correctly 
anticipated characters and those in completed suf- 
fixes. Investigation revealed the bulk of this to 
be attributable to morphological error. In order 
to give the system a better chance of getting in- 
flections right, we modified the behaviour of the 
hypothesis generator so that it would never pro- 
duce the same best candidate more than once for 
a single token; in other words, when the trans- 
lator duplicates the first character of a proposal, 
the system infers that the proposal is wrong and 
changes it. As shown in table 1, completion per- 
formance improves ubstantially as a result. Fig- 
ure 5 contains a detailed record of a completion 
session that points up one further deficiency in the 
system: it proposes punctuation hypotheses too 
often. We found that simply suppressing punctu- 
ation in the generator led to another small incre- 
ment in keystroke savings, as indicated in table 1. 
letters are not normally followed by either spaces or 
punctuation. We assume the system can detect hese 
and automatically suppress the character used to ef- 
fect the completion.

6 Conc lus ion  
The work described in this paper constitutes a 
rudimentary but concrete first step toward a new 
approach to IMT in which the medium of inter- 
action is simply the target text itself. In con- 
trast with previous interactive approaches, the 
translator is never expected to perform tasks that 
are outside the realm of translation proper (such 
as advising a machine about common sense is- 
sues). In line with the spirit of truly interac- 
tive approaches, the translator is called upon early 
enough to guide the system away from a "raw ma- 
chine translation" he or she would rather not have 
to revise. And in fact the machine is now the one 
required to revise its own copy, making use of ev- 
ery keystroke ntered by the translator to steer 
itself in a useful direction. 
This strikes us as the "proper place" of men 
and machines in IMT, and we intend to contiime 
exploring this promising avenue in our future re-

Figure 5: A sample completion run Ibr the English source sentence We all realize that like many other countries, 
rich or poor, Canada has too many citizens who cannot afford deeent housing. The first column contains the 
French target sentence; the second the prefix typed by the translator, followed by a plus sign; and the third the
