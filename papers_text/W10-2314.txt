Abstract
We present a brief overview of the way
in which image analysis, coupled with
associated collateral text, is being used
for auto-annotation and sentiment analy-
sis. In particular, we describe our ap-
proach to auto-annotation using the graph-
theoretic dominant set clustering algo-
rithm and the annotation of images with
sentiment scores from SentiWordNet. Pre-
liminary results are given for both, and our
planned work aims to explore synergies
between the two approaches.
1 Automatic annotation of images using
graph-theoretic clustering
Recently, graph-theoretic approaches have be-
come popular in the computer vision field. There
exist different graph-theoretic clustering algo-
rithms such as minimum cut, spectral clustering,
dominant set clustering. Among all these algo-
rithms, the Dominant Set Clustering (DSC) is a
promising graph-theoretic approach based on the
notion of a dominant set that has been proposed
for different applications, such as image segmen-
tation (Pavan and Pelillo, 2003), video summariza-
tion (Besiris et al, 2009), etc. Here we describe
the application of DSC to image annotation.
1.1 Dominant Set Clustering
The definition of Dominant Set (DS) was intro-
duced in (Pavan and Pelillo, 2003). Let us con-
sider a set of data samples that have to be clus-
tered. These samples can be represented as an
undirected edge-weighted (similarity) graph with
no self-loops G = (V,E,w), where V = 1, . . . , n
is the vertex set, E ? V ? V is the edge set,
and w : E ? R?+ is the (positive) weight func-
tion. Vertices in G represent the data points,
whereas edges represent neighborhood relation-
ships, and finally edge-weights reflect similarity
between pairs of linked vertices. An n ? n sym-
metric matrix A = (aij), called affinity (or simi-
larity) matrix, can be used to represent the graph
G, where aij = w(i, j) if (i, j) ? E, and aij = 0
if i = j. To define formally a Dominant Set, other
parameters have to be introduced. Let S be a non-
empty subset of vertices, with S ? V , and i ? S.
The (average) weighted degree of i relative to S is
defined as:
awdegS(i) =
1
|S|
?
j?S
aij
where |S| denotes the number of elements in S.
It can be observed that awdeg{i}(i) = 0 for any
i ? V . If j /? S we can define the parameter
?S(i, j) = aij ? awdegS(i) that is the similarity
between nodes j and i with respect to the average
similarity between node i and its neighbors in S. It
can be noted that ?{i}(i, j) = aij , for all i, j ? V
with i 6= j. Now, if i ? S, the weight wS(i) of i
relative to S is:
wS(i) =
{ 1 if |S| = 1
P
j?S\{j} ?S\{i}(j, i)wS\{i}(j) otherwise.
This is a recursive equation where to calculate
wS(i) the weights of the set S\{i} are needed. We
can deduce that wS(i) is a measure of the overall
similarity between the node i and the other nodes
in S\{i}, considering the overall similarity among
the nodes in S\{i}. So, the total weight of S can
be defined as:
W (S) =
?
i?S
wS(i).
A non-empty subset of vertices S ? V such that
W (T ) > 0 for any non-empty T ? S is defined
as a dominant set if the following two conditions
88
are satisfied: 1. ?i ? S, wS(i) > 0; and 2.?i 6? S,
wS?{i}(i) < 0. These conditions characterize the
internal homogeneity of the cluster and the exter-
nal inhomogeneity of S. As a consequence of this
definition, a dominant set cluster can be derived
from a graph by means of a quadratic program (Pa-
van and Pelillo, 2003). Let x be an n-dimensional
vector, where n is the number of vertices of the
graph and its components indicate the presence of
nodes in the cluster. Let A be the affinity matrix of
the graph. Let us consider the following standard
quadratic program:
max f(x) = xTAx
s.t. x ? ? (1)
where ? = {x ? 0 and eT x = 1} is the standard
simplex of Rn. If a point x? ? ? is a local max-
imum of f , and ?(x?) = {i ? V : x?i > 0} is
the support of x?, it can be shown that the support
?(x?) is a dominant set for the graph. So, a dom-
inant set can be derived by solving the equation
(1). The following iterative equation can be used
to solve (1):
xi(t + 1) = xi(t)
(Ax(t))i
x(t)TAx(t)
where t denotes the number of iterations. To sum-
marize the algorithm, a dominant set is found and
removed from the graph. A second dominant clus-
ter is extracted from the remaining part of the
graph, and so on. This procedure finishes when
all the elements in the graph have been assigned to
a cluster.
1.2 Image annotation using DSC
Here we present an approach to automatically an-
notate images using the DSC algorithm. In the
initialization phase (training) the image database
is split into L smaller subsets, corresponding to
the different image categories or visual concepts
that characterize the images in the database. In
this process only tags are exploited: an image is
included in all subsets corresponding to its tags.
Given a subset l, the corresponding affinity ma-
trix Al is calculated and used by the DSC algo-
rithm. Following (Wang et al, 2008), the ele-
ments of the affinity matrix Al = (aij) are de-
fined as aij = e?w(i,j)/r
2
where w(i, j) represents
the similarity function between images i and j in
the considered subset l, and r > 0 is the scaling
factor used as an adjustment function that allows
the control of clustering sensitivity. We use the
MPEG.7 descriptors (Sikora, 2001) as features for
computing the similarity between images. Follow-
ing the DSC approach, we can construct all clus-
ters of subset l with similar images, and associate
them with the tag of subset l.
In the test phase, a new image is annotated asso-
ciating to it the tag of the cluster that best matches
the image. To do this, we use a decision algo-
rithm based on the computation of the MSE (Mean
Square Error), where for each cluster we derive a
feature vector that represents all the images in that
cluster (e.g., the average of all the feature vectors).
The tag of the cluster with smaller MSE is used for
the annotation.
For our experiments, we consider a subset of
the Corel database, that consists of 4287 images
in 49 categories (L = 49). The 10% of images in
each category have been randomly selected from
the database and used only for testing. In Fig-
ure 1 we report the annotation accuracy results ob-
tained on 15 different classes with optimal param-
eter r = 0.2. For some classes the accuracy is
very high, whereas for others the accuracy is very
low (under 30%). The total annotation accuracy
considering all the 49 classes is roughly 69%.
In a second set of experiments we consider a
set of 6531 images from the MIR Flickr database
(Huiskes and Lew, 2008), where each image is
tagged with at least one of the chosen 30 visual
concepts (L = 30). Images are characterized by
multiple tags associated to them, thus an image is
included in all the corresponding subsets. For test-
ing we use 875 images. To evaluate the annotation
accuracy we compare the automatically associated
tag with the user defined tags of that image. In Fig-
ure 1 we report the annotation accuracy obtained
for the 30 different categories, with the optimal pa-
rameter r = 0.2. The total annotation accuracy is
about 87%.
Further simulations are in progress to evaluate
the accuracy of multiple tags that can be associ-
ated to the test set in the MIR Flickr database. In-
deed, our idea is to annotate the images consider-
ing the other common tags of the images belong-
ing to each cluster.
2 Annotating Sentiment
In the previous section we were concerned with
annotating images with visual concepts, typically
object names or descriptors. A separate strand of

Flickr database (right).
our work is concerned with opinion analysis in
multimedia information and the automatic identi-
fication of sentiment. The study of image indexing
and retrieval in the library and information science
fields has long recognized the importance of sen-
timent in image retrieval (Jo?rgensen, 2003; Neal,
2006). It is only recently however, that researchers
interested in automated image analysis and re-
trieval have become interested in the sentiment as-
sociated with images (Wang and He, 2008).
To date, investigations that have looked at the
association between sentiment and image con-
tent have been limited to small datasets (typically
much less than 1000) and rather specific, spe-
cially designed image features. Recently, we have
started to explore how sentiment is related to im-
age content using much more generic visual-term
based features and much larger datasets collected
with the aid of lexical resources such as Senti-
WordNet.
2.1 SentiWordNet and Image Databases
SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is a
lexical resource built on top of WordNet. Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) is a thesaurus containing
textual descriptions of terms and relationships be-
tween terms (examples are hypernyms: ?car? is a
subconcept of ?vehicle? or synonyms: ?car? de-
scribes the same concept as ?automobile?). Word-
Net distinguishes between different part-of-speech
types (verb, noun, adjective, etc.). A synset in
WordNet comprises all terms referring to the same
concept (e.g., {car, automobile}). In SentiWord-
Net a triple of three senti-values (pos, neg, obj)
(corresponding to positive, negative, or rather neu-
tral sentiment flavor of a word respectively) are
assigned to each WordNet synset (and, thus, to
each term in the synset). The senti-values are in
the range of [0, 1] and sum up to 1 for each triple.
For instance (pos, neg, obj) = (0.875, 0.0, 0.125)
for the term ?good? or (0.25, 0.375, 0.375) for
the term ?ill?. Senti-values were partly created
by human assessors and partly automatically as-
signed using an ensemble of different classifiers
(see (Esuli, 2008) for an evaluation of these meth-
ods).
Popular social websites, such as Flickr, con-
tain massive amounts of visual information in the
form of photographs. Many of these photographs
have been collectively tagged and annotated by
members of the respective community. Recently
in the image analysis community it has become
popular to use Flickr as a resource for building
datasets to experiment with. We have been explor-
ing how we can crawl Flickr for images that have
a strong (positive or negative) sentiment associ-
ated with them. Our initial explorations have been
based around crawling Flickr for images tagged
with words that have very high positive or negative
sentiment according to their SentiWordNet classi-
fication.
Our image dataset has been refined by assign-
ing an overall sentiment value to each image based
on its textual metadata and discarding images with
low overall sentiment. At the simplest level we
use a dictionary of clearly positive and negative
SentiWords, with which we assign a positive (+1)
sentiment value if the text representation only con-
90

tains positive sentiment terms, and a negative (-1)
sentiment value if it only contains negative senti-
ment terms. We discarded images with neither a
positive nor negative score. Currently we are also
exploring more powerful ways to assign sentiment
values to images.
2.2 Combining Senti-values and Visual
Terms
In the future we intend to exploit the use of tech-
niques such as the one described in Section 1.2
in order to develop systems that are able to pre-
dict sentiment from image features. However, as a
preliminary study, we have performed some small-
scale experiments on a collection of 10000 images
crawled from Flickr in order to try and see whether
a primitive visual-bag-of-terms (Sivic and Zisser-
man, 2003; Hare and Lewis, 2005) can be asso-
ciated with positive and negative sentiment values
using a linear Support Vector Machine and Sup-
port Vector Regression. The visual-term bag-of-
words for the study was based upon a quantisation
of each pixel in the images into a set of 64 dis-
crete colours (i.e., each pixel corresponds to one
of 64 possible visual terms). Our initial results
look promising and indicate a considerable cor-
relation between the visual bag-of-words and the
sentiment scores.
Discriminative Analysis of Visual Features. In
our small-scale study we have also performed
some analysis in order to investigate which visual-
term features are most predictive of the positive
and negative sentiment classes. For this analysis
we have used the Mutual Information (MI) mea-
sure (Manning and Schuetze, 1999; Yang and Ped-
ersen, 1997) from information theory which can
be interpreted as a measure of how much the joint
distribution of features (colour-based visual-terms
in our case) deviate from a hypothetical distribu-
tion in which features and categories (?positive?
and ?negative? sentiment) are independent of each
other.
Figure 2 illustrates the 16 most discriminative
colours for the positive and negative classes. The
dominant visual-term features for positive senti-
ment are dominated by earthy colours and skin
tones. Conversely, the features for negative sen-
timent are dominated by blue and green tones.
Interestingly, this association can be explained
through intuition because it mirrors human per-
ception of warm (positive) and cold (negative)
colours.
Currently we are working on expanding our
preliminary experiments to a much larger image
dataset of over half a million images and incor-
porating more powerful visual-term based image
features. In addition to seeking improved ways of
determining image sentiment for the training set
we are planning to combine the dominant set clus-
tering approach to annotation presented in Sec-
tion 1.2 with the sentiment annotation task of this
section and compare the combined approach with
other state of the art approaches as a step towards
achieving robust image sentiment annotation.
3 Conclusions
The use of dominant set clustering as a basis for
auto-annotation has shown promise on image col-
lections from both Corel and from Flickr. We have
also shown how that visual-term feature represen-
tations show some promise as indicators of sen-
timent in images. In future work we plan to com-
bine these approaches to provide better support for
opinion analysis of multimedia web documents.
