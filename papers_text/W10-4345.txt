Abstract
We perform a study of existing dialogue
corpora to establish the theoretical max-
imum performance of the selection ap-
proach to simulating human dialogue be-
havior in unseen dialogues. This maxi-
mum is the proportion of test utterances
for which an exact or approximate match
exists in the corresponding training cor-
pus. The results indicate that some do-
mains seem quite suitable for a corpus-
based selection approach, with over half of
the test utterances having been seen before
in the corpus, while other domains show
much more novelty compared to previous
dialogues.
1 Introduction
There are two main approaches toward automat-
ically producing dialogue utterances. One is the
selection approach, in which the task is to pick
the appropriate output from a corpus of possible
outputs. The other is the generation approach, in
which the output is dynamically assembled using
some composition procedure, e.g. grammar rules
used to convert information from semantic repre-
sentations and/or context to text.
The generation approach has the advantage of
a more compact representation for a given gener-
ative capacity. But for any finite set of sentences
produced, the selection approach could perfectly
simulate the generation approach. The generation
approach generally requires more analytical effort
to devise a good set of grammar rules that cover
the range of desired sentences but do not admit un-
desirable or unnatural sentences. Whereas, in the
selection approach, outputs can be limited to those
that have been observed in human speech. This
affords complex and human-like sentences with-
out much detailed analysis. Moreover, when the
output is not just text but presented as speech, the
system may easily use recorded audio clips rather
than speech synthesis. This argument also extends
to multi-modal performances, e.g. using artist an-
imation motion capture or recorded video for an-
imating virtual human dialogue characters. Often
one is willing to sacrifice some generality in or-
der to achieve more human-like behavior than is
currently possible from generation approaches.
The selection approach has been used for a
number of dialogue agents, including question-
answering characters at ICT (Leuski et al, 2006;
Artstein et al, 2009; Kenny et al, 2007), FAQ
bots (Zukerman and Marom, 2006; Sellberg and
Jo?nsson, 2008) and web-site information charac-
ters. It is also possible to use the selection ap-
proach as a part of the process, e.g. from words to
a semantic representation or from a semantic rep-
resentation to words, while using other approaches
for other parts of dialogue processing.
The selection approach presents two challenges
for finding an appropriate utterance:
? Is there a good enough utterance to select?
? How good is the selection algorithm at find-
ing this utterance?
We have previously attempted to address the sec-
ond question, by proposing the information or-
dering task for evaluating dialogue coherence
(Gandhe and Traum, 2008). Here we try to ad-
dress the first question, which would provide a
theoretical upper bound in quality for any selec-
tion approach. We examine a number of different
dialogue corpora as to their suitability for the se-
lection approach.
We make the following assumptions to allow
automatic evaluation across a range of corpora.
Actual human dialogues represent a gold-standard
for computer systems to emulate; i.e. choosing an
actual utterance in the correct place is the best pos-
sible result. Other utterances can be evaluated as
to how close they come to the original utterance,
245
using a similarity metric.
Our methodology is to examine a test corpus of
human dialogue utterances to see how well a se-
lection approach could approximate these, given a
training corpus of utterances in that domain. We
look at exact matches as well as utterances having
their similarity score above a threshold. We in-
vestigate the effect of the size of training corpora,
which lets us know how much data we might need
to achieve a certain level of performance. We also
investigate the effect of domain of training cor-
pora.
2 Dialogue Corpora
We examine human dialogue utterances from a va-
riety of domains. Our initial set contains six dia-
logue corpora from ICT as well as three other pub-
licly available corpora.
SGT Blackwell is a question-answering char-
acter who answers questions about the U.S. Army,
himself, and his technology. The corpus con-
sists of visitors interacting with SGT Blackwell at
an exhibition booth at a museum. SGT Star is
a question-answering character, like SGT Black-
well, who talks about careers in the U.S. Army.
The corpus consists of trained handlers present-
ing the system. Amani is a bargaining character
used as a prototype for training soldiers to perform
tactical questioning. The SASO system is a ne-
gotiation training prototype in which two virtual
characters negotiate with a human ?trainee? about
moving a medical clinic. The Radiobots system is
a training prototype that responds to military calls
for artillery fire. IOTA is an extension of the Ra-
diobots system. The corpus consists of training
sessions between a human trainee and a human in-
structor on a variety of missions. Yao et al (2010)
provides details about the ICT corpora.
Other corpora involved dialogues between
two people playing specific roles in planning,
scheduling problem for railroad transportation,
the Trains-93 corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1994)
and for emergency services, the Monroe corpus
(Stent, 2000). The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey
et al, 1992) consists of telephone conversations
between two people, based on provided topics.
We divided the data from each corpus into a
training set and a test set, as shown in Table 1. The
data consists of utterances from one or more hu-
man speakers who engage in dialogue with either
virtual characters (Radiobots, Blackwell, Amani,
Star, SASO) or other humans (Switchboard, Mon-
roe, IOTA, Trains-93). These corpora differ along
a number of dimensions such as the size of the
corpus, dialogue genre (question-answering, task-
oriented or conversational), types of tasks (ar-
tillery calls, moving and scheduling resources, in-
formation seeking) and motivation of the partici-
pants (exploring a new technology ? SGT Black-
well , presenting a demo ? SGT Star, undergo-
ing training ? Amani, IOTA or simply for collect-
ing the corpus ? Switchboard, Trains-93, Monroe).
While the set of corpora we include does not cover
all points in these dimensions, it does present an
interesting range.
3 Dialogue Utterance Similarity Metrics
To answer the question of whether an adequate
utterance exists in our training corpus that could
be selected and used, we need an appropriate-
ness measure. We assume that an utterance pro-
duced by a human in a dialogue is appropriate,
and thus the problem becomes one of construct-
ing an appropriate similarity function to compare
the human-produced utterance with the utterances
available from the training corpus. Given a train-
ing corpus Utrain and a similarity function f ,
we calculate the score for a test utterance ut as,
maxsimf (ut) = maxi f(ut, ui);ui ? Utrain
There are several choices for the utterance simi-
larity function f . Ideally such a function would
take meaning and context into account rather than
just surface similarity, but these aspects are harder
to automate, so for our initial experiments we look
at several surface metrics, as described below.
Exact measure returns 1 if the utterances are ex-
actly same and 0 otherwise. 1-WER, a similar-
ity measure related to word error rate, is defined
as min (0, 1? levenshtein(ut, ui)/length(ut)).
METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), one of
the automatic evaluation metrics used in machine
translation is a good candidate for f . METEOR
finds optimal word-to-word alignment between
test and reference strings based on several modules
that match exact words, stemmed words and syn-
onyms. METEOR is a tunable metric and for our
analysis we used the default parameters tuned for
the Adequacy & Fluency task. All previous mea-
sures take into account the word ordering of test
and reference strings. In contrast, document simi-
larity measures used in information retrieval gen-
erally follow the bag of words assumption, where a

4 Experiments
Results Within a Domain
In our first experiment, we computed maxsimf
scores for all test corpus utterances in a given
domain using the training utterances from the
same domain. For the domains Blackwell, SGT
Star, SASO, Amani & Radiobots which are imple-
mented dialogue systems our corpus consists of
user utterances only. For Trains 93 and Monroe
corpora, we make sure to match the speaker roles
for ut and ui. For Switchboard, where speakers
do not have any special roles and for IOTA, where
the speaker information was not readily accessi-
ble, we ignore the speaker information and select
utterances from either speaker.
Table 1 reports the mean of maxsimf scores.
These can be interpreted as the expectation of
maxsimf score for a new test utterance. The
higher this expectation, the more likely it is that
an utterance similar to the new one has been
seen before and thus the domain will be more
amenable to selection approaches. This table
also shows the percentage of utterances that had
a maxsimMeteor score above a certain thresh-
old. The correlation between maxsimf for dif-
ferent choices of f (except Exact match) is very
high (Pearson?s r > 0.94). The histogram anal-
ysis shows that SGT Star, Blackwell, Radiobots
1Switchboard (SWBD) is a very large corpus and for run-
ning our experiments in a reasonable computing time we only
selected a small portion of it.
Figure 1: maxsimMeteor vs # utterances in train-
ing data for different domains
and SASO domains are better suited for selec-
tion approaches. Domains like Trains-93, Monroe,
Switchboard and Amani have a more diffuse dis-
tribution and are not best suited for selection ap-
proaches, at least with the amount of data we have
available. The IOTA domain falls somewhere in
between these two domain classes.
Effect of Training Data Size
Figure 1 shows the effect of training data size
on the maxsimMeteor score. Radiobots shows
very high scores even for small amounts of train-
ing data. SGT Star and SGT Blackwell also con-
verge fairly early. Switchboard, on the other hand,
does not achieve very high scores even with a
large number of utterances. For all domains, with
around 2500 training utterances maxsimMeteor
reaches 90% of its maximum possible value for
the training set.

In order to understand the similarities be-
tween different dialogue domains, we computed
maxsimMeteor for a test domain using training

sets from other domains. In this exercise, we ig-
nored the speaker information. Table 2 reports
the mean values of maxsimMeteor for different
training domains. For all the testing domains,
using the training corpus from the same domain
produces the best results. Notice that Radiobots
also has good performance with the IOTA train-
ing data. This is as expected since IOTA is an
extension of Radiobots and should cover a lot of
utterances from the Radiobots domain. Switch-
board and Blackwell training corpora have a over-
all higher score for all testing domains. This may
be due to the breadth and size of these corpora. On
the other extreme, the Radiobots training domain
performs very poorly on all testing domains other
than itself.
5 Discussion
We have examined how well suited a corpus-
based selection approach to dialogue can succeed
at mimicking human dialogue performance across
a range of domains. The results show that such an
approach has the potential of doing quite well for
some domains, but much less well for others. Re-
sults also show that for some domains, quite mod-
est amounts of training data are needed for this
operation. Applying this method across corpora
from different domains can also give us a simi-
larity metric for dialogue domains. Our hope is
that this kind of analysis can help inform the de-
cision of what kind of language processing meth-
ods and dialogue architectures are most appropri-
ate for building a dialogue system for a new do-
main, particularly one in which the system is to
act like a human.
