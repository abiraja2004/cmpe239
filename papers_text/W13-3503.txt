Abstract
We design a new co-occurrence based
word association measure by incorpo-
rating the concept of significant co-
occurrence in the popular word associ-
ation measure Pointwise Mutual Infor-
mation (PMI). By extensive experiments
with a large number of publicly available
datasets we show that the newly intro-
duced measure performs better than other
co-occurrence based measures and de-
spite being resource-light, compares well
with the best known resource-heavy dis-
tributional similarity and knowledge based
word association measures. We investi-
gate the source of this performance im-
provement and find that of the two types
of significant co-occurrence - corpus-level
and document-level, the concept of cor-
pus level significance combined with the
use of document counts in place of word
counts is responsible for all the perfor-
mance gains observed. The concept of
document level significance is not helpful
for PMI adaptation.
1 Introduction
Co-occurrence based word association measures
like PMI, LLR, and Dice are popular since they
are easy to understand and computationally effi-
cient. They measure the strength of association
between two words by comparing the word pair?s
corpus-level bigram frequency to some function of
the unigram frequencies of the individual words.
Recently a new measure called Co-occurrence
Significance Ratio (CSR) was introduced
in (Chaudhari et al, 2011) based on the no-
tion of significant co-occurrence. Since CSR was
found to perform better than other co-occurrence
measures, in this work, our goal was to incorpo-
rate the concept of significant co-occurrence in
traditional word-association measures to design
new measures that may perform better than both
CSR and the traditional measures.
Two different notions of significant co-
occurrence are employed in CSR:
? Corpus-level significant co-occurrence de-
termines whether the ratio of observed bi-
gram occurrences to their expected occur-
rences across the corpus can be explained as
a pure chance phenomenon, and,
? Document-level significant co-occurrence
determines whether a large fraction of a
word-pair?s occurrences within a given doc-
ument have smaller spans than that under a
null model where the words in the document
are permuted randomly.
While both these notions are employed in an
integrated fashion in CSR, on analyzing CSR de-
tails, we realized that these two concepts are in-
dependent and can be applied separately to any
word association measure which is a ratio of
some variable?s observed frequency to its ex-
pected frequency. We incorporate the concepts
of corpus-level and document-level significant co-
occurrence in PMI to design a new measure that
performs better than both PMI and CSR, as well as
other co-occurrence based word association mea-
sures. To incorporate document level significance,
we need to use document level counts instead of
word level counts (this distinction is explained
in detail in Section 4.3). To investigate whether
the performance gains observed are because of
the concept of significant co-occurrence or sim-
ply because of the fact that we are using docu-
ment counts instead of the word counts, we also
design document count based baseline version of
PMI called PMId, and several intermediate vari-
ants whose definitions are given in Table 1.
To our surprise, we discover that the concept
of document level significant co-occurrence does

not contribute to the PMI performance improve-
ment. Two newly designed, best-performing mea-
sures cPMId and cPMIz have almost identical per-
formance. As the definitions in Table 1 show,
cPMId incorporates corpus level significance in a
document count based version of PMI but does
not employ the concept of document level signif-
icance, whereas cPMIz employs both corpus and
document level significance. This demonstrates
that the concept of corpus level significance com-
bined with document counts is responsible for all
the performance gains observed.
To summarize, we make the following contribu-
tions in this work:
? We incorporate the notion of significant co-
occurrence in PMI to design a new measure
cPMId that performs better than PMI as well
as other popular co-occurrence based word-
association measures on both free association
and semantic relatedness tasks. In addition,
despite being resource-light, cPMId performs
as well as the best known distributional sim-
ilarity and knowledge based measures which
are resource-intensive.
? We investigate the source of this performance
improvement and find that of the two notions
0We consider only those word-pair occurrences where
inter-word distance between x and y is atmost s, the span
threshold. For a particular occurrence of x, we get a window
of size s on either side within which y can occur. Strictly
speaking, there should be a factor 2s in the denominator of
the formula for PMI. Since we are only interested in the rel-
ative rankings of word-pairs, we follow the standard practice
of ignoring the 2s factor, as its removal affects only the abso-
lute PMI values but not the relative rankings.
of significance - corpus-level and document-
level significant co-occurrence, the concept
of document level significant co-occurrence
is not helpful for PMI adaptation. The con-
cept of corpus level significance combined
with document counts is responsible for all
the performance gains observed.
2 Related Work
Word association measures can be divided into
three broad categories: knowledge based, dis-
tributional similarity based, and co-occurrence
based measures. Knowledge-based measures
are based on thesauri, semantic networks, tax-
onomies, or other knowledge sources (Liberman
and Markovitch, 2009; Yeh et al, 2009; Milne
and Witten, 2008; Hughes and Ramage, 2007).
Distributional similarity-based measures compare
two words by comparing distributional similar-
ity of other words around them (Agirre et al,
2009; Wandmacher et al, 2008; Bollegala et al,
2007). In this work, our focus is on Co-occurrence
based measures and hence we do not discuss
Knowledge-based and Distributional similarity-
based measures further.
Co-occurrence based measures estimate asso-
ciation between two words by computing some
function of the words unigram and bigram fre-
quencies. Table 2 contains definitions of popu-
lar co-occurrence measures. The concept of docu-
ment and corpus level significance can be applied
to any word association measure which is defined
as the ratio of a variable?s observed frequency to
its expected frequency. While Chi-Square (?2),

Hence our focus in this work is on designing new
measures by incorporating the notion of signifi-
cant co-occurrence in PMI.
3 Incorporating Corpus Level
Significance
In (Chaudhari et al, 2011), the concept of corpus
level significance was introduced by bounding the
probability of observing a given corpus level phe-
nomenon under a particular null model. In the for-
mula for PMI, the observed frequency of a word
pair?s occurrences is compared with its expected
frequency under a null model which assumes in-
dependent unigram occurrences. Near a given oc-
currence of the word x in the corpus, the word y
can be observed with probability f(y)/W . Hence
the expected value of f(x, y) is f(x) ? f(y)/W .
Adapting from (Chaudhari et al, 2011) and using
Hoeffding?s Inequality, the probability of observ-
ing a given deviation between f(x, y) and its ex-
pected value f(x) ? f(y)/W can be bounded. For
any t > 0:
P [f(x, y) ? f(x) ? f(y)/W + f(x) ? t]
? exp(?2 ? f(x) ? t2)
= ?
The upper-bound ? (= exp(?2?f(x)?t2)) denotes
the probability of observing more than f(x) ?
f(y)/W + f(x)? t bigram occurrences in the cor-
pus, just by chance, under the given independent
unigram occurrence null model. With ? as a pa-
rameter (0 < ? < 1) and t = ?ln ?/(?2 ? f(x)),
we can define a new word association measure
called Corpus Level Significant PMI(cPMI) as:
cPMI(x, y) = log f(x, y)f(x) ? f(y)/W + f(x) ? t
= log f(x, y)
f(x) ? f(y)/W +
?
f(x) ?
?
ln ?/(?2)
where t = ?ln ?/(?2 ? f(x)).
By taking the probability of observing a given
deviation between f(x, y) and its expected value
f(x) ? f(y)/W in account, cPMI addresses one
of the main weakness of PMI of working only
with probabilities and completely ignoring the ab-
solute amount of evidence. In two scenarios where
all frequency ratios (that of f(x), f(y), f(x, y),
and W ) are equal, PMI values will be same while
cPMI value will be higher for the case where ab-
solute number of occurrences are higher. This can
be seen easily by multiplying all of f(x), f(y),
f(x, y), and W with some constant n:
log n ? f(x, y)

4 Incorporating Document Level
Significant Co-occurrence
Traditional measures like PMI can be viewed as
working with a null hypothesis where each word
in a document is generated completely indepen-
dently of the other words in that document. With
each word, a global unigram generation probabil-
ity is associated and all documents are assumed
to be generated as per a multinomial distribution.
Such a null model generates different expected
span (inter-word gap) for high frequency words vs.
low frequency words. In reality, if strongly associ-
ated words co-occur in a document then they do so
with low span, i.e., they occur close to each-other
regardless of the underlying unigram frequencies.
22
4.1 Determining Document Level
Significance
To correct this span bias of traditional measures,
a new null model is employed in (Chaudhari et
al., 2011). A bag of word is associated with each
document. The null model assumes that the ob-
served document is a random permutation of the
associated bag of words. Given the occurrences of
a word-pair in the document, if the number of oc-
currences with span less than a given threshold can
be explained by this null model then the word pair
is assumed to be unassociated in the document.
Else, some form of association is assumed. Fol-
lowing definitions are introduced in (Chaudhari et
al., 2011) to formalize this concept.
Definition 1 (span-constrained frequency) Let
f be the maximum number of non-overlapped
occurrences of a word-pair ? in a document. Let
f?s(0 ? f?s ? f) be the maximum number of
non-overlapped occurrences of ? with span less
than a given threshold s. We refer to f?s as the
span-constrained frequency of ? in the document.
For a given document of length ` and a word-
pair with f occurrences in it, as we vary the span
threshold s, the number of occurrences of the
word-pair with span less than s, i.e. its span-
constrained frequency f?s varies. For a given s
and the f?s resulting from it, we can ask, what is
the probability that f? s out of f occurrences of a
word-pair in a document of length `will have span
less than s, if the words in the document were to
be permuted randomly. If this probability is less
than some threshold , then we can assume that
the words in the pair have some tendency of co-
occurring in the document. Formally,
Definition 2 (-significant co-occurrence) Let `
be the length of a document and let f be the fre-
quency of a word-pair ? in it. For a given a span
threshold s, define pis(f?s, f, `) as the probability
under the null that ? will appear in the document
with a span-constrained frequency of at least f?s.
Given a probability threshold  (0 <  < 1) and
a span threshold s, the document is said to support
the hypothesis ?? is an -significant word-pair
within the document? if we have [pis(f? s, f, `) <
].
The key idea is that we should concentrate on
those documents where a word pair has an -
significant occurrence and ignore its occurrences
in non -significant documents. This point is more
subtle than it appears. Earlier, if the span of an oc-
currence was less than a threshold, it was counted,
else it was ignored. In the new null model, in-
stead of an individual occurrence, all occurrences
of the word-pair in the document are considered as
a single unit. Either all occurrences confirm to the
null model or they do not. Of course, some occur-
rences will have span less than the threshold while
others will have higher span, but when consider-
ing significance, all occurrences in the document
are considered significant or insignificant as a unit.
This point is discussed further in Section 4.3.
4.2 pis[] Computation Overhead
The detailed discussion of the computation of pis[]
table can be found in (Chaudhari et al, 2011). For
our work, it suffices to know that pis[] table needs
to be computed only once and hence it can be done
offline. We use the pis[] table made publicly avail-
able1 by CSR researchers. The use of pis[] table
simply entails a memory lookup and does not in-
crease the computation cost of a measure.
4.3 Adapting PMI for Document Level
Significance
Consider the cPMI definition given earlier. One
way to adapt it for document significance is to alter
the numerator such that only the span-constrained
bigram occurrences in -significant documents are
considered in computing f(x, y).
However, this simple adaptation is problem-
atic. Consider a document with f occurrences of
a word-pair of which span of f?s occurrences is at-
most s, the given span threshold. In the definition
of cPMI, the numerator takes in account only those
occurrences whose span is less than s, i.e., only the
f?s occurrences from a document. As discussed
earlier, the -significance of a document is deter-
mined by looking at all f occurrences as a whole.
In the null model, whether a particular occurrence
has span less than or greater than s is not so impor-
tant, what matters is that span of f? s occurrences
out of f is at most s. The word-pair is considered
an -significant pair within the document if the ob-
served span of all f occurrences of the pair can be
explained by the null model. Hence, when adapt-
ing for -significance, it is improper to count only
f?s occurrences out of f .
The way out of this difficulty is to count the doc-
uments and not the words. We do this adaptation
1http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/ damani/papers/EMNLP11/resources.html
23
in two steps. First, we replace the word counts
with document counts in the definition of cPMI,
giving a new measure called Corpus Level Signifi-
cant PMI based on Document count (cPMId):
cPMId(x, y) = log d(x, y)
d(x) ? d(y)/D +
?
d(x) ?
?
ln ?/(?2)
where d(x, y) indicates the number of documents
containing at least one span constrained occur-
rence of (x, y), and d(x) and d(y) indicate the
number of document containing x and y, D indi-
cates the total number of documents in the corpus,
and as before, ? is a parameter varying between 0
and 1.
Having replaced the word counts with docu-
ment counts, we now incorporate the concept of
document level significant co-occurrence (as dis-
cussed in Section 4.1) in cPMId by replacing
d(x, y) in numerator with Z which is defined as:
Definition 3 (Z) Let Z be the number of doc-
uments that support the hypothesis ?the given
word-pair is an -significant word-pair?, i.e., Z is
the number of documents for which pis(f? s, f, `) <
.
The new measure is called Document and Corpus
Level Significant PMI (cPMIz) and is defined as:
cPMIz(x, y) = log Z
d(x) ? d(y)/D +
?
d(x) ?
?
ln ?/(?2)
Note that cPMIz has three parameters: span
threshold s, the corpus level significant parame-
ter ? (0 < ? < 1) and the document level signif-
icant parameter  (0 <  < 1). In comparison,
cPMI/cPMId have s and ? as parameters while
PMI has only s as the parameter. The three pa-
rameters of cPMId are similar to those of CSR.
cPMIz and cPMId differ in the fact that cP-
MId does not incorporate the document level sig-
nificance. Similarly, we can design another mea-
sure that differs from cPMIz in that it does not in-
corporate corpus level significance. This measure
is called Document Level Significant PMI (PMIz)
and is defined as:
PMIz(x, y) = log Zd(x) ? d(y)/D
Baseline Measure: Suppose cPMIz were to do
better than the PMI. One could ask whether the
improvement achieved is due to the concept of sig-
nificant co-occurrence or is it simply a result of
the fact that we are counting documents instead of
words. To answer this, we design a baseline ver-
sion of PMI where we simply replace word counts
with document counts. The new baseline measure
is called PMI based on Document count (PMId)
and is defined as:
PMId(x, y) = log d(x, y)
d(x) ? d(y)/D
5 Performance Evaluation
Having introduced various measures, we wish to
determine whether the incorporation of corpus and
document level significance improves the perfor-
mance of PMI. Also, if the adapted versions per-
form better than PMI, what are the sources of the
improvements. Is it the concept of corpus level or
document level significance or both, or is the per-
formance gain simply a result of the fact that we
are counting documents instead of words? Since
the newly introduced measures have multiple pa-
rameters, how sensitive is their performance to the
parameter values.
To answer these questions, we repeat the exper-
iments performed in (Chaudhari et al, 2011), us-
ing the exact same dataset, resources, and method-
ology - the same 1.24 Gigawords Wikipedia cor-
pus and the same eight publicly available datasets
- Edinburgh (Kiss et al, 1973), Florida (Nelson
et al, 1980), Kent (Kent and Rosanoff, 1910),
Minnesota (Russell and Jenkins, 1954), White-
Abrams (White and Abrams, 2004), Goldfarb-
Halpern (Goldfarb and Halpern, 1984), Word-
sim (Finkelstein et al, 2002), and Esslli (ESSLLI,
2008). Of these, Wordsim measures semantic re-
latedness which encompasses relations like syn-
onymy, meronymy, antonymy, and functional as-
sociation (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). All other
datasets measure free association which refers to
the first response given by a subject on being given
a stimulus word (ESSLLI, 2008).
5.1 Evaluation Methodology
Each measure is evaluated by the correlation be-
tween the ranking of word-associations produced
by the measure and the gold-standard human rank-
ing for that dataset. Since all methods have at least
one parameter, we perform five-fold cross valida-
tion. The span parameter s is varied between 5 and
50 words, and  and ? are varied between 0 and 1.
Each dataset is partitioned into five folds - four for

training and one for testing. For each association
measure, the parameter values that perform best
on four training folds is used for the remaining
one testing fold. The performance of a measure
on a dataset is its average Spearman rank correla-
tion over 5 runs with 5 different test folds.
5.2 Experimental Results
Results of the 5-fold cross validation are shown
in Table 3. From the results we conclude that the
concept of significant co-occurrence improves the
performance of PMI. The newly designed mea-
sures cPMId and cPMIz perform better than both
PMI and CSR on all eight datasets.
5.3 Performance Improvement Analysis
We can infer from Table 3 that the concept of cor-
pus level significant co-occurrence and not that
of document level significant co-occurrence is re-
sponsible for the PMI performance improvement.
The Spearman rank correlation for cPMIz and cP-
MId are almost identical. cPMId incorporates cor-
pus level significance in a document count based
version of PMI but unlike cPMIz, it does not em-
ploy the concept of document level significance.
To underscore this point, we also compute the
difference between the correlation of each mea-
sure from the correlation of the best measure for
each data set. For each measure we can then com-
pute the average deviation of the measure from the
best performing measure across datasets. In Ta-
ble 4 we present these average deviations. We ob-
serve that:
? Average deviation reduces as we move hor-
izontally across a row - from PMI to cPMI,
from PMId to cPMId, and from PMIz to cP-
MIz. This shows that the incorporation of
corpus level significance helps improve the
performance.
? The average deviation reduces as we move
vertically from the first row to the second -
from PMI to PMId, and from cPMI to cP-
MId. This shows that the performance gain
achieved is also due to the fact that we are
counting documents instead of words.
? Finally, the average deviation remains practi-
cally unchanged as we move vertically from
the second row to the third - from PMId to
PMIz, from cPMId to cPMIz. This shows
that the incorporation of document level sig-
nificance does not help improve the perfor-
mance.
5.4 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
To find out the sensitivity of cPMId performance
to the parameter values, we evaluate it for different
parameter combinations and present the results in
Table 5. To save space, we show some of the com-
binations only, though one can see the continuity
of performance with gradually changing parame-
ter values.

Table 6: 5-fold cross validation comparison of cPMId with other PMI variants.
From the results we conclude that the per-
formance of cPMId is reasonably insensitive to
the actual parameter values. For a large range
of parameter combinations, cPMId?s performance
varies marginally and most of the parameter com-
binations perform close to the best. If one does not
have a training corpus then one can chose the best
performing (20w, 0.7) as default parameter values.
As an aside, introducing extra tunable pa-
rameter occasionally reduces performance, as is
the case for Goldfarb-Halpern and Esslli datasets
where (*,*) is not the best performing cobination.
This happens when the parameters combination
that performs best on the four training fold turns
out particularly bad for the testing fold.
5.5 Comparison with other measures
Before comparing cPMId with other measures, we
note that while all co-occurrence measures being
compared have span threshold s as a parameter,
cPMId has an extra tunable parameter ?. While
we would like to argue that part of power of cP-
MId comes from this extra tunable parameter, for
an arguably fairer comparison, we would like to
fix the ? value and then compare so that all meth-
ods have only one tunable parameter s. In Table 5
we find that ? = 0.9 performs best on the fewest
number of datasets and hence we select this fixed
value for comparison. However most of the con-
clusions that follow do not change if we were to
fix some other ? value, or keep it variable.
5.5.1 Comparison with other PMI variants
In Section 3 we pointed out the PMI only works
with probabilities and ignores the absolute amount
of evidence. Another side-effect of this phe-
nomenon is that PMI over-values sparseness. All
frequency ratios (that of f(x), f(y), and f(x, y))
being equal, bigrams composed of low frequency
words get higher score than those composed of
high frequency words. In particular, in case of
perfect dependence, i.e. f(x) = f(y) = f(x, y),
PMI(x, y) = log Wf(x,y) . cPMId addresses thisweakness by explicitly bounding the probability
of observing a given deviation between f(x, y)
and its expected value f(x) ? f(y)/W . Other re-

searchers have addressed this issue by modifying
PMI such that its upper value gets bounded.
Since the maximum value of f(x,y)f(x)?f(y)/W is
1
f(x,y)/W , one way to bound the former is to di-
vide it by later. (Daille, 1994) defined PMI2 as:
PMI2(x, y) = log
f(x,y)
f(x)?f(y)/W
1
f(x,y)/W
= log f(x, y)
2
f(x) ? f(y)
In (Bouma, 2009), it was noted that max. and min.
value of PMI2 are 0,??, whereas one can get1,-1 as the bounds if one normalize PMI as nPMI:
nPMI(x, y) =
log f(x,y)f(x)?f(y)/W
log 1f(x,y)/W
In Table 6, we compare the performance of
word and document count based variants of PMI2
and nPMI with PMI and cPMId. We find that
while both nPMI and PMI2 perform better than
PMI,cPMId performs better than both variants of
nPMI and PMI2 on almost all datasets.
5.5.2 Comparison with other co-occurrence
based measures
In Table 7, we compare cPMId with other co-
occurrence based measures defined in Table 2.
We find that cPMId performs better than all other
co-occurrence based measures. Note that perfor-
mance of Jaccard and Dice measure is identical to
the second decimal place. This is because for our
datasets f(x, y)  f(x) and f(x, y)  f(y) for
most word-pairs under consideration.
5.5.3 Comparison with non co-occurrence
based measures
For completeness of comparison, we also compare
the performance of cPMId with distributional sim-
ilarity and knowledge based measures discussed in
Section 2. Of the datasets discussed here, these
measures have only been tested on the Wordsim
dataset. In Table 8, we compare the performance
of cPMId with these other measures on the Word-
sim dataset. We can see that cPMId compares well
with the best non co-occurrence based measures.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
By incorporating the concept of significant co-
occurrence in PMI, we get a new measure which
performs better than other co-occurrence based
measures. We investigate the source of the perfor-
mance improvement and find that of the two no-
tions of significance: corpus-level and document-
level significant co-occurrence, the concept of cor-
pus level significance combined with use docu-
ment counts in place of word counts is responsi-
ble for all the performance gains observed. We
also find that the performance of the newly intro-
duced measure cPMId is reasonably insensitive to
the values of its tunable parameters.
