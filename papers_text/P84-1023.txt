Abstract 
Sublanguages _differ from each other, and from the "stan- 
dard Ian~age,  in their syntactic, semantic, and 
discourse vrolx:rties. Understanding these differences i
important'if -we are to improve our ability to process 
these sublanguages. We have developed a sen~.'- 
automatic ~ure  for identifying sublangnage syntact/c 
usage from a sample of text in the sublanguage..We 
describe the results of applying this procedure to taree 
text samples: two sets of medical documents and a set of 
equipment failure me~ages. 
Introduction 
b A sub~age. is  th.e f.oan.of ..natron." ~a~ 
y a oommumty ot s~ts  m atm~mg a resmctea 
domain. Sublanguages differ from each other, and tron}. 
the "standard language, in their syntactic, ~ant ic ,  anti 
discourse properties. We describe ~ some rec~.t 
work on (-senii-)automatically determining the.syntactic_ 
properties of several sublangnages. This work m part ot 
a larger effort aimed at improving the techniques for 
parsing sublanguages. 
If we esamine a variety of scientific and technical 
sublanguages, we will encounter most of the constructs of 
the standard language, plus a number of syntactic exten- 
sions. For example, report" sublantgnag ~, such as are 
used in medical s||mmarles and eqmpment failure sum- 
maries, include both full sentences and a number of ~ag- 
merit forms \[Marsh 1983\]. Specific sublanguages differ 
in their usage of these syntactic onstructs \[Kittredge 
1982, Lehrberger 1982\]. 
Identifying these differences i important in under- 
standing how sublanguages differ from the Language as a 
whole. It also has immediate practical benefits, since it 
allows us to trim our grammar tO fit the specific sub- 
language we are processing. This can significantly speed 
up the analysis process and bl~.k some spurious parses 
which wouldbe obtained with a grammar of Overly broad 
coverage. 
Determining Syntaai? Usage 
Unf .ort~natcly, a~l..uirin~ the data .about ,yn~'c  
usage can De very te~ous, masmuca ~ st reqmres .me 
analysis of hundreds (or even thousands) of s~. fence., for 
each new sublangnage to.be proces____~i. We nave mere- 
fore chosen to automate this process. 
We are fortunate to have available to us a very 
broad coverage English grammar, the Linguistic.St~ing 
Grammar \[S~gor 1981\], which hp been ex~. d~ 
include the sentence fragn~n_ ts of certain medical aria 
cquilnnent failure rcixn'm \[Marsh 1983\]. The gram,--," 
consmts of a context-~r=, component a.ugmehtc~l .by 
pr~ura l  restrictions which capture v_.anous ynt.t.t ~ 
and sublanguage _semantic cons_tt'aints. "l\]~e con~-  . 
component is stated in terms ot lgra.mmatical camgones 
such as noun, tensed verb, and ad~:tive. 
To be. gin .the analysis proceSS, a sample .mrpus is 
usmg this gr~,-=-,: .The me of generanm par~s_ 
m reviewed manually to eliminate incorrect ~ .  x ne 
remalningparses are then fed to a program which .cc~ts 
-- for each parse tree and .cumulatively for ~ entb'e me 
.- the number of times that each production m me 
context-free component of the grammar was applied in 
building the tr?~. This yields a "trimmed" context-fr?~ 
grammar for. the sublangua!~e (consLsting ~. ~osc pro- 
ductions usea one or more tunes), atong w~m zrequency 
information on the various productions. 
This process was initially applied to text. sampl~ 
from two Sublanguages. The .fi~s. t is a set o.x s~ pauent 
documents (including patient his.tm'y., eTam,n.ation, .and 
plan of treatment). The second m a set ot electrical 
equipment failure relxals called "CASREPs', a class of 
operational report used by the U. S. Navy \[Froscher 
1983\]. The parse file for the patient documents had 
correct parses for 236 sentences (and sentence frag- 
ments); the file for the CASREPS had correct parses tor 
123 sentences. We have recently applied the process, to a 
third text sample, drawn from a subIanguage v ry stmflar 
to the first: a set of five hospital discharge summaries , 
Which include patient histories, e~nmlnnt\[ous, and sum- 
maries of the murse of treatment in the hospital. This 
last sample included correct parses for 310 sentences.

Results 
The trimmed grarnrtl~l~ du~ from thc three 
sublanguage t xt samples were of comparable size. The 
grammar produced from the first set of patient docu- 
menU; col~tained 129 non-termlnal symbols and 248 pro- 
ductions; the grnmmar from the second set (the 
"discharge summaries") Was Slightly \]~trger, with 134 
non-termin~ds and 282 productions. The grammar for the 
CASREP sublanguage was slightly smaller, with 124 
non-terminal~ and 220 productions (this is probably a 
reflection of the smaller size of the CASR text sam- 
ple). These figures compare with 255 non-termlnal sym- 
bols and 744 productions in the "medical records" gram- 
mar used by the New York University Linguistic String 
Pro~=t (the "medical records" grammar iS the Lingttistic 
String Project English Grammar with extensions for sen- 
tencc fragments and other, sublanguagc specific, con- 
structs, and with a few options deleted). 
Figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative growth in the 
size of the I~"immed grammars for the three sublanguages 
as a function of the number of sentences in the sample. 
In Ftgure 1 we plot the number of non-term/hal symbols 
in the grammar as a function of sample size; in Figure 2, 
the number of productions in the ~ as a function 
of sample size. Note that the curves for the two medical 
sublanguages (curves A and B) have pretty much fiat- 
tcned out toward the end, indicating that, by that point, 
the trimmed grnmm~tr COVe'S a V~"y lar~ fra~on of the 
sentences in the sublanguage. (Some of the jumps in the 
growth curves for the medical grAmmarS refleet he ~vi- 
sion of the patient documents into sections (history, pl3y- 
sical exam, lab tests, etc.) with different syntactic charac- 
teristics. For the first few documents, wl3en a new see- 
tion bedim, constructs are encountered which did not 
appear m prior sections, thus producing a jump in the 
c11rve.) 
The sublanguage gramma~ arc substantially smaller 
than the full English grammar, reflecting the more lim- 
itcd range of modifiers and complements in these sub- 
languages. While the full grammar has 67 options for 
sentence object, the sublanguage rammars have substan- 
tially restricted mages: each of the three sublanguage 
grammars has only 14 object options. Further, the gram- 
mars greatly overlap, so that the three grammars com- 
bined contain only 20 different object options. While 
sentential complements of nouns are available in the full 
grammar, there arc no i~tanc~ of such a:~\[lstrllcfions in 
either medical sublanguage, aad only one instance in the 
CASREP sublanguage. The range of modifiers iS also 
much restricted ia the sublangu=age rammars as com- 
pared to the full grammar. 15 options for sentential 
modifiers are available in the full grammar. These are 
restricted to 9 in the first medical sample, 11 in the 
second, and 8 in the equipment failure sublangua~e. 
Similarly, the full English gr~mmnr has 21 options tor 
right modifiers of nouns; the sublanguage r~mma_~S had 
fewer, 11 in the first medical sumple, I0 m" the second, 
and 7 in the CASREP sublanguage. Here the sub- 
language grammars overlap almost completely: only 12 
different right modifiers of  noun are represented in the 
three grammars combined. 
Among the options occurring in all the sublanguage 
grammars, their relative frequency varies ao~o~ding to
the domain of the text. For example, the frequency of 
prepositional phrases as right modifiers of nouns (meas; 
urea as instances per sentence or sentence fragment) was 
0.36 and 0.46 for the two medical samples, as compared 
to 0.77 for the CASREPs. More striking was the fre- 
quency of noun phrases with nouns as modifiers of other 
nouns: 0.20 and 0.32 for the two medical ~mples, 
versus 0.80 for the CASREPs. 
We reparsed some of the sentences from the first set 
of medical documents with the trimmed grammar and, as 
~ ,  o.bserved a considerable " speed-up. The 
t.mgumuc ~mng rarser uses a p.op-uown pa.~mg algo- 
rithm with.,  .ba~track~" g. A,~Ldingly , for short, simple 
sentences which require little backtr~.king there was only 
a small gain in processing speed (about 25%). For long, 
complex sentences, however, which require extensive 
backtracking, the speed-up (by roughly a factor of 3) was 
approximately proportional to the reduction in the 
number of productions. In addition, the ~fyequcncy of 
bad parses decreased slightly (by <3%) with the 
l~mmed y .mm.r  (because some of the bad parses 
involved syntactic onstructs which did not appear m any 
o~,,~ect parse in the sublanguage sample). 
Discussion 
As natural .lan..~,uage interfaces become more 
mature, their portability .- the ability to move an inter- 
face to a new domain and sublenguage -. is becoming 
increasingly important. At 8 minimllm, portability 
requires us to isolate the domain dependent information 
in a natural \]aDgua.~.e system \[C~OSZ 1983, Gri~hman 
1983\]. A more ambitious goal m to provide a discovery 
procedure for this information -. a procedure Wl~eh can 
determine the domain dependent information from sam- 
ple texts in the sublanguage. The tcchnklUeS described 
above provide a partial, semi-automatic discovery pro- 
cedure for the syntactic usages of a sublangua~.* By 
applying .these . t~gues  to a small sub lan~ sample, 
we ~ adapt a broad-coverage rammar tO the syntax of 
a particular sublanguage. Sub~.quont text from this sub- 
language caa then be i~xessed more efficiently. 
We are currently extending this work in two direc- 
tions. For sentences with two or more parses which 
~ atisfy .both the syntactic and the sublanguage s lectional semanu.'c) onstraints, we intena to try using the/re- 
Cency information ga~ered for productions to select, a
invol "ving the more frequent syntactic constructs.** 
Second, we are using a s~milAr approach to develop a 
discovery procedure for sublanguage s lectional patterns. 
We are collecting, from the same sublanguage samples, 
statistics on the frequency of co-occurrence of particular 
sublan .guage (semantic) classes in subjeet.vedy.ob~:ct and 
host-adjunct relations, and are using this data as input to 
* Partial, because it cannot identify new extensions 
to the base gramme; semi-automatic, because the 
parses produced with the broad-coverage rammar 
? must be manually reviewed. 
* Some small experiments of this type have been 
one with a Japanese ~ \[Naga 0 1982\] with 
1|mired success. Becat~ of the v~_ differ~t na- 
ture of the grammar, however, it is not dear 
whether this lass any implications for our experi- 
ments.
