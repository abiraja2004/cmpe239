Abstract 
Ngram models are simple in language 
modeling and have been successfully used in 
speech recognition and other tasks. However, 
they can only capture the short distance 
context dependency within an n-words 
window where currently the largest practical n 
for a natural language is three while much of 
the context dependency in a natural language 
occurs beyond a three words window. In order 
to incorporate this kind of long distance 
context dependency in the ngram model of our 
Mandarin speech recognition system, this 
paper proposes a novel MI-Ngram modeling 
approach. This new MI-Ngram model consists 
of two components: a normal ngram model 
and a novel MI model. The ngram model 
captures the short distance context dependency 
within an n-words window while the MI 
model captures the context dependency 
between the word pairs over a long distance 
by using the concept of mutual information. 
That is, the MI-Ngram model incorporates the 
word occurrences beyond the scope of the 
normal ngram model. It is found that MI-
Ngram modeling has much better performance 
than the normal word ngram modeling. 
Experimentation shows that about 20% of 
errors can be corrected by using a MI-Trigram 
model compared with the pure word trigram 
model.   
1 Introduction 
Language modeling is the attempt to 
characterize, capture and exploit the 
regularities and constraints in a natural 
language and has been successfully applied to 
many domains. Among all the language 
modeling approaches, ngram models have 
been most widely used in speech recognition 
(Jelinek 1990; Gale and Church 1990; Brown 
et al 1992; Yang et al 1996) and other 
applications. While ngram models are simple 
in language modeling and have been 
successfully used in speech recognition and 
other tasks, they have obvious deficiencies. 
For instance, ngram models can only capture 
the short-distance dependency within an n-
words window where currently the largest 
practical N for a natural language is three.  
In the meantime, it is found that there 
always exist many preferred relationships 
between words. Two highly associated word 
pairs are ?not only/but also? and 
?doctor/nurse?. Psychological experiments in 
Meyer D. et al (1975) indicated that the 
human?s reaction to a highly associated word 
pair was stronger and faster than that to a 
poorly associated word pair. Such preference 
information is very useful for natural language 
processing (Church K.W. et al 1990; Hiddle 
D. et al 1993; Rosenfeld R. 1994 and Zhou 
G.D. et al1998). Obviously, the preference 
relationships between words can expand from 
a short to long distance. While we can use 
conventional ngram models to capture the 
short distance dependency, the long distance 
dependency should also be exploited properly. 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a 
new modeling approach to capture the context 
dependency over both a short distance and a 
long distance and apply it in Mandarin speech 
recognition. 
This paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we present the normal ngram 
modeling while a new modeling approach, 
named MI-ngram modeling, is proposed in 
Section 3. In Section 4, we will describe its 
use in our Mandarin speech recognition 
system. Finally we give a summary of this 
paper.

Traditionally, simple statistical models, 
known as ngram models, have been widely 
used in speech recognition. Within an ngram 
model, the probability of a word occurring 
next is estimated based on the  previous

For a pair (  over a distance  where 
 and

A B  are word strings, the mutual 
information  reflects the degree of 
preference relationship between the two 
strings over a distance . Several properties 
of the mutual information are apparent: 
)d,,( BAMI
dObviously, an ngram model assumes that 
the probability of the next word  is 
independent of the word string  in the 
history. The difference between bigram, 
trigram and other ngram models is the value of 
n. The parameters of an ngram model are thus 
the probabilities:

the mutual information to measure the

where  ,  and i . That is 
to say, the mutual information of the next 
word with the history is assumed equal to the 
summation of that of the next word with the 
first word in the history and that of the next 
word with the rest word string in the history. 
Then we can re-write Equation (3.3) by using 
Equation (3.4),

Using an alternative view of equivalence, 
an ngram model is one that partitions the data 
into equivalence classes based on the last n-1 
words in the history. Viewed in this way, a 
bigram induces a partition based on the last 
word in the history. A trigram model further 
refines this partition by considering the next-
to-last word and so on.

Compared with the normal word ngram 
model, the novel MI-Ngram model also 
incorporates the long distance context 
dependency by computing the mutual 
information of the distance dependent word 
pairs. That is, the MI-Ngram model 
incorporates the word occurrences beyond the 
scope of the normal ngram model. 
Since the number of possible distance-
dependent word pairs may be very huge, it is 
impossible for the MI-Ngram model to 
incorporate all the possible distance-dependent 
word pairs. Therefore, for the MI-Ngram 
model to be practically useful, how to select a 
reasonable number of word pairs becomes 
most important. Here two approaches are used

One approach is to restrict the window size 
of possible word pairs by computing and 
comparing the conditional perplexities 
(Shannon C.E. 1951) of the long distance word 
bigram models for different distances. 
Conditional perplexity is a measure of the 
average number of possible choices there are 
for a conditional distribution. The conditional 
perplexity of a conditional distribution with 
the conditional entropy  is defined to 
be 2 . Given two random variables 
H Y X( | )
H Y X( | ) X and 
Y , a conditional probability mass function 
, and a marginal probability mass 
function , the conditional entropy of 
P y xY X| ( | )
P yY ( ) Y  
given X , , is defined as: H Y( | X )

From Equation (3.8), we can see that the 
first three items are the values computed by 
the normal word trigram model as shown in 
Equation (2.9)  and the forth item 
 contributes to 
summation of the mutual information of the 
next word with the words in the history . 
Therefore, we call Equation (3.8) as a MI-
Ngram model and rewrite it as:

For a large enough corpus, the conditional 
perplexity is usually an indication of the 
amount of information conveyed by the model: 
the lower the conditional perplexity, the more 
information it conveys and thus a better model.  
This is because the model captures as much as 
it can of that information, and whatever 
uncertainty remains shows up in the 
conditional perplexity. Here, the corpus is the 
XinHua corpus, which has about 57M(million) 
characters or 29M words. For all the 
experiments, 80% of the corpus is used for

Table 1 shows that the conditional 
perplexity is lowest for d = 1 and increases 
significantly as we move through d = 2, 3, 4, 5 
and 6. For d = 7, 8, 9, the conditional 
perplexity increases slightly while further 
increasing d almost does not increase the 
conditional perplexity. This suggests that 
significant information exists only in the last 6 
words of the history. In this paper, we restrict 
the maximum window size to 10.

mutual information to select a reasonable 
number of distance-dependent word pairs:

Obviously, Equation (3.12) takes the joint 
probability into consideration. That is, those 
frequently occurring word pairs are more 
important and have much more potential to be 
incorporated into the MI-Ngram model than 
less frequently occurring word pairs. 
4 Experimentation 
We have evaluated the new MI-Ngram model 
in  an experimental speaker-dependent 
continuous Mandarin speech recognition 
system (Zhou G.D. et al1999). For base 
syllable recognition, 14 cepstral and 14 delta-
cepstral coefficients, energy(normalized) and 
delta-energy are used as feature parameters to 
form a feature vector with dimension 30, while 
for tone recognition, the pitch period and the 
energy together with their first order and 
second order delta coefficients are used to 
form a feature vector with dimension 6. All the 
acoustic units are modeled by semi-continuous 
HMMs (Rabiner 1993). For base syllable 
recognition, 138 HMMs are used to model 100 
context-dependent INITIALs and 38 context-
independent FINALs while 5 HMMs are used 
to model five different tones in Mandarin 
Chinese. 5,000 short sentences are used for 
training and another 600 sentences (6102 
Chinese characters) are used for testing.  All 
the training and testing data are recorded by 
one same speaker in an office-like laboratory 
environment with a sampling frequency of 
16KHZ. 
As a reference, the base syllable recognition 
rate and the tone recognition rate are shown in 
Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. As the word 
trigram model is most widely used in current 
research, all the experiments have been done 
using a MI-Trigram model which is trained on 
the XINHUA news corpus of 29 million 
words(automatically segmented) while the 
lexicon contains about 28000 words. As a 
result, the perplexities and Chinese character 
recognition rates of different MI-Trigram 
models with the same window size of 10 and 
different numbers of distance-dependent word 
pairs are shown in Table 4.

3,500,000 169 92.6 
4,000,000 168 92.7 
Table 4 shows that the perplexity and the 
recognition rate rise quickly as the number of 
the long distance-dependent word pairs in the 
MI-Trigram model increase from 0 to 800,000, 
and then rise slowly. This suggests that the 
best 800,000 word pairs carry most of the long 
distance context dependency and should be 
included in the MI-Ngram model. It also 
shows that the recognition rate of the MI-
Trigram model with 800,000 word pairs is 
1.9% higher than the pure word trigram model 
(the MI-Trigram model with 0 long distance-
dependent word pairs). That is to say, about 
20% of errors can be corrected by 
incorporating only 800,000 word pairs to the 
MI-Trigram model compared with the pure 
word trigram model. 
It is clear that MI-Ngram modeling has 
much better performance than normal word 
ngram modeling. One advantage of MI-Ngram 
modeling is that its number of parameters is 
just a little more than that of word ngram 
modeling. Another advantage of MI-Ngram 
modeling is that the number of the word pairs 
can be reasonable in size without losing too 
much of its modeling power. Compared to 
ngram modeling, MI-Ngram modeling also 
captures the long distance dependency of word 
pairs using the concept of mutual information. 
4. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a novel MI-Ngram 
modeling approach to capture the context 
dependency over both a short distance and a 
long distance. This is done by incorporating 
long distance-dependent word pairs into 
normal ngram modeling by using the concept 
of mutual information. It is found that MI-
Ngram modeling has much better performance 
than word ngram modeling.
