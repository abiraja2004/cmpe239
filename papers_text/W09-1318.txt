1 Introduction
Identifying serious infectious disease outbreaks in
their early stages is an important task, both for na-
tional governments and international organizations
like the World Health Organization. Text mining
and information extraction systems can provide an
important, low cost and timely early warning sys-
tem in these circumstances by identifying the first
signs of an outbreak automatically from online tex-
tual news. One interesting characteristic of disease
outbreak reports ? which to the best of our knowl-
edge has not been studied before ? is their use of
speculative language (hedging) to describe uncertain
situations. This paper describes two uses of hedging
to enhance the BioCaster disease outbreak report
text mining system.
Following a brief description of the BioCaster
system and corpus (section 2), we discuss in section
3 previous uses of hedging in NLP and the meth-
ods used to identify hedges in the current work. In
section 4 we describe some initial classification ex-
periments using hedge features. Section 5 describes
a ?speculative? method of tagging disease outbreak
reports with a metric designed to aid users of the
BioCaster system in identifying articles of inter-
est.
2 BioCaster System & Corpus
The BioCaster system scans online news reports
for stories concerning infectious disease outbreaks
(e.g. H5N1, Ebola) and makes its results available to
registered users as email alerts (Collier et al, 2008).
In addition to this email service, data that has been
filtered through a topic classifier but which is still
uninterpreted is used to populate a Google Map ap-
plication called the Global Health Monitor.1
The BioCaster corpus consists of 1000 news
articles downloaded from the WWW and then man-
ually categorized and annotated with Named Entities
by two PhD students. Articles were collected from
various news sources (e.g. BBC, New York Times
and ProMED-Mail2). Each document is classified
as either relevant (350) or reject (650).3
The corpus is designed to include difficult border-
line cases where more advanced understanding of
the context is required. For example, an article may
be about, say, polio, but not centrally concerned with
specific outbreaks of that disease. Instead, the arti-
cle could report a vaccination campaign or research
breakthrough.
3 Hedges
According to Hyland (1998), in an extensive study
of speculative language in science writing, hedges
?are the means by which writers can present a propo-
sition as an opinion rather than a fact.? More re-
cently, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) have presented
a method for automatically identifying hedges in the
biomedical domain. In the current work, we used a
science orientated hedge lexicon derived from Mer-
cer et al (2004). The lexicon consisted of 72 verbs
(including appear, appears, appeared, appearing,
indicate, indicates, indicated, indicating, and so on)
and 32 non-verbs (including, about, quite, poten-

tially, likely and so on). Preliminary work showed
that the frequency of hedge words differs in the two
categories of the BioCaster corpus (relevant and
reject) at a highly significant level using the ?2 test
(P < 0.01). Table 1 shows the 16 most discriminat-
ing hedge words in the BioCaster corpus (identi-
fied using the ?2 feature selection method.)
4 Classification Experiment
The current BioCaster system uses n-gram based
text classification to identify disease outbreak re-
ports, and reject other online news. We used hedg-
ing features to augment this classifier, and evaluated
the results using a subset of the BioCaster cor-
pus. One binary hedging feature was used. The fea-
ture was ?true? if and only if one of the 105 hedge
lexemes identified by Mercer et al (2004) occurred
in the input document within 5 words of a disease
named entity. Results are shown in Table 2, where it
can be seen that the addition of a single binary hedge
feature to the unigram feature set increases accuracy
by 0.8%. The performance does not however reach
the level achieved by the ?2 9000 n-gram feature set
described in Conway et al (2008).
5 Towards a ?Speculative? Metric
Users of the BioCaster system would benefit
from an indicator of how ?speculative? each news
article is, as breaking news regarding disease out-
breaks is characterized by uncertainty, which is en-
coded using hedging. We use the Mercer list of 105
hedging words as described above, in conjunction
with statistics derived from a 10,000 document sec-
Accept (%) Reject (%)
High 64.2 48.3
Medium 29.5 36.7
Low 6.3 15.0

tion of the Reuters corpus to provide a ?speculative?
metric.4 We calculated total frequencies for all 105
hedge words in each of the 10,000 Reuters docu-
ments ? that is, the total number of hedge words
per document ? then ranked these frequencies (af-
ter normalizing the frequencies to take account of
document length). The bottom third of documents
had hedge percentages in the range 0% - 0.2544%
(LOW). The middle third had hedge percentages in
the range 0.2545% - 1.0574 (MEDIUM). The range
for the top third was 1.0575% - 100% (HIGH). Doc-
uments inputted to the BioCaster system auto-
matically have their proportion of hedge words cal-
culated and are assigned a value according to their
position on the scale (LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH). Ta-
ble 3 shows that a majority of the documents in the
accept segment of the BioCaster corpus can be
tagged as highly speculative using this method.
