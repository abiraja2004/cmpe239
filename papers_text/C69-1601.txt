Summary 
This cont r ibut ion  presents  the resu l ts  of compar i son  of 
Dutch  texts wr i t ten  by b i l ingua ls  I) (speak ing F rench  and 
Dutch) ,  w i th  Dutch  texts regarded as STANDARD WRITTEN DUTCH. 
The a t tent ion  was focussed on F rench  loan-words  appear ing  
in both  types of texts and the d i f fe rences  in thei r  use. 
Cer ta in  genera l i za t ions  as to the mechan isms of in ter fe rence  
are suggested.  
I . Mater~ls 
The mater ia l s  used for the present  cont r ibut ion  be long  to 
two  groups : 
r Group A : texts wr i t ten  by f rancophones  w i th  ca. 6 years  
of Dutch t ra in ing.  These texts represent  what  
we cal l  Francophone Wr i t ten  Dutch  (below FWD).  
- g roup  B : Texts from recent  contemporary  Dutch  l i te ra ture  
by both  Dutch  and F lemish  authors .  They w i l l  
here represent  Standard  Wr i t ten  Dutch  (SWD). 
============================================================== 
(~ We are great ly  indebted  for the ass i s tance  of oul co l -  
leages Mr .L .DE  BUSSCHERE,  who prepared  al l  computer  programs 
needed in this invest igat fon ,  Mr .R .EECKHOUT,  who he lped us 
with many suggest ions  as to the poss ib i l i t ies  of in fo rmat ion  
process ing  techn iques  and with c r i t i ca l  remarks  concern ing  
the l ingu is t i c  aspects  of our prob lem,  and - last but not

vers i ty  of Louvain ,  who put at our d i sposa l  the IBM-360 com-

The texts of group A were  wr i t ten  by 400 f rancophone 18 year-  
old pup i l s  in the h ighest  c lasses  at the 61 pr ivate  secundary  
schoo ls  in Brusse ls  and its suburbs.  This sample represents  
one f i f th  of the total popu la t ion .  From every pupi l  we obta ined  
two Dutch  compos i t ions ,  one of them a p iece of homework  wr i t ten  
in November  \]967, another  an examinat ion  compos i t ion  f rom 
December  of the same year. The reasons  for this choice are 
ev ident ,  s ince the pup i l s  can cal l  in their  parents '  and thei r  
d ic t ionar ies '  ass i s tance  in the f i rst  s i tuat ion  but not in the 
second.  
From every  compos i t ion  the f i rst  125 words  were  put on punch-  
cards together  w i th  coded in format ion  as to their  source.  In 
this way  a corpus  of ca. 100,000 words  was  compi led .  In order 
to a l low for compar i son  of re la t ive  parameters  such as word-  
spread,  vocabu lary -growth  etc.,  it was later d iv ided  into two 
parts  each conta in ing  ca. 50 ,000 words  (parts I and 2 be low) .  
The texts of group B, i.e. the SWD, were  obta ined  by put t ing  
together  ext racts  from l i terary  work  by I0 contemporary  authors .  
This antho logy  gave us a corpus of some \]O,0OO words .  
The f i rst  part  of group A re f lec ts  ca. 50 d i f fe rent  sub ject -  
mat ters ,  whereas  the SWD-antho logy  re f lects  only \]O sub ject -  
mat ters  or " themes" .  So the d ispropor t ion  of corpora  is out-  
we ighed by a themes/tokens rat io  wh ich  is I/ 10 in both  corpora .  
In order  to es t imate  the in f luence  of sub jec t -mat ter  on word-  
cho ice  and espec ia l ly  on the rate of vocabu lary -growth ,  a com- 
par i son  was made between the |O-author -corpus  and a f ragment  of 
ca. 10,0OO words  f rom one s ing le  author.  The resu l ts  show that 
the vocabu lary -growth  remains  a lmost  unchanged,  i.e. that the 
d ivers i ty  of sub jec t -mat ters  does not substant ia l l y  in f luence  
the numer ica l  va lues  of g rowth  rate (fig. l). In accordance  w i th  
this resu l t ,  we suggested  that each of these texts (groups A 
and B) be regarded as wr i t ten  by one s ingle person.

2 Lexical ~ter~rence 
The main purpose of this cont r ibut ion  is to test and ver i fy  
certa in non-computat iona l  ins ights made about language inter- 
ference in general .  Dutch presents  a very po ignant  example of 
this phenomenon since its vocabu lary  conta ins  a very large 
number of French loan- and fore ign words and there is st i l l  
an "open door" a l lowing  the int rus ion  of lexieal  ga l l i c i sm in 
pract ica l ly  un l imi ted quant i ty .  Thus the Dutch vocabu lary  
holds a lot of para l le l  lexemes of both  or ig ins,  e.g. analyse~ 
ontleding, fenomeen/verschijnsel, decep~ie/ontgoocheling etc. 
This s i tuat ion  st rongly  resembles  that of Eng l i sh  wi th  its 
Ang lo -Saxon  and Romance words,  a l though the semant ic  d i f fer -  
ent ia t ion  of such word-pa l rs  seems to have progressed  much 
more there. Whereas the nat ive  Dutch speaker  plays both keys 
w i th  an unb iased ease, for the Be lg ian  f rancophone this ambig-  
uous s i tuat ion  produces  cer ta in  const ra in ts  and d i f f i cu l t ies ,  
wh ich  have v is ib le  ef fects  on word-cho ice ,  growth rate of 
fo re ign  words  and vocabu lary  size in general .  
For reasons of s impl i c i ty  our invest igat ion  did not adopt the 
usual  d i s t inc t ion  between loan-words  and fore ign words  since 
this is based on the d i f fe rent  degrees  of in tegrat ion  of 
fore ign lexemes,  measured  by d i f fe rences  in p ronunc ia t ion ,  
social  acceptab i l i ty  w i th in  the speak ing communi ty  and cer ta in  
prescr ip t ive  a r rangements  such as their inc lus ion  in vocabu la -  
ries and d ic t ionar ies ,  whose author i ty  is genera l ly  accepted.  
As the aim of our invest igat ion  was to find ways of p rov id ing  
numer ica l  va lues for in ter fe rence  phenomena,  we proceeded in 
a pure ly  descr ip t ive  way, using only e tymolog ica l  c r i te r ia  to 
d i s t ingu ish  between or ig ina l  and fore ign lexical  e lements .  
Thus we cons idered  units conta in ing  e i ther  lexical  or morpho-  
logical  e lements ,  or both,  as loan-words.  So bonjouPen with  
its French lexical  e lement  was entered,  but also trotser#n 
because  of its French word- f romat iona l  part.  Compos i ta  conta i -  
n ing only one fore ign e lement  (e.g. avondto~let) were treated as 
loan-words  unless this e lement  had a l ready been entered as an 
autonomous  word.  No d i s t inc t ion  was made between fore ign words 
inc luded in the Standard Dutch Vocabu lary  of van Dale ,(e.g. 
assaut) amd those wh ich  are not ment ioned  there (e,g.auberge), 
both examples  occur r ing  in our invest igat ion  mater ia ls .  S ince 
the computer  p rogram did not prov ide for lemma- l ike  items, all 
d i f fe rent  morpho log ica l  forms and der ivat ions  of words  were  
regarded  as d i f fe rent  types; thus expresoie, expressief, ex- 
pressionlst etc. are counted as d i f fe rent  items. Also for 
reasons of s impl ic i ty  all non-French  fore ign  words  are re le-  
gated here to the category  of pure Dutch items. 
3. Lexical mter~renceand word-~ngth 
As a f irst  approx imat ion  test the percentage  of fo re ign  words  
in the vocabu lary  in both  FWD- and SWD-texts  was es tab l i shed .  
The resul ts  are as fo l lows : 
TOKENS TYPES ZogTYPES 
FWD 47,307 5,653 0.8375 
SWD 10,358 2,616 0.8807 
FOREIGN TYP ~ogF.T. 
648 0 .4954 
% F.TYPES~ 
11.85  
141 O.4285 5.38 
The d i f fe rence  of fore ign vocabu lary  rat io in both  groups 
resul ts  in d i s t r ibut iona l  d i f fe rences  of words  of d iverg ing  
le t ter -number .  Though the overal l  word - length  of tokens in 
both  groups is near ly  ident ica l  (4.5\] for SWD and 4.61 for FWD) 
en  app l i ca t ion  of the ch i - square  test proved the d ivergences  
of word d i s t r ibut ion  (words be long ing  to d i f fe rent  word-  
c lasses) to be h igh ly  s ign i f i cant .  The average word- length  of 
types (M) is d i f fe rent  in both  groups : 
FWD 
SWD 
M o 
7.85  2 .97  
7 .03 2.72 
As the pronunc ia t ion  of F rench words is in most cases adapted 
to the Dutch ones (and this is re f lected  in the or thography) ,  
it was not p laus ib le  to suppose that this d ivergence  was due 
noly to the propor t iona l  d i f fe rence  of fore ign words.  It was 
found that the d ivergence  was part ly  due tO the use of eompos i ta  
in FWD; their d i s t r ibut ion  d i f fers  cons iderab ly  from SWD. This 
is str ikingly evident for word- length |0 (fig.2) The fact that 
FWD-authors Would "switch in" this Dutch-formational  device in 
cases where the Dutch native speaker does not, shows that fran- 
cophones are "over-aware" of this means of translat ing the 
French genitive construct ion by a Dutch compositum (e.g. pot de 
~eu~8> b loempot ) .  This fact strengthens the assumption made in 
this paper, that the lexieal level of language is very closely 
connected with higher (syntactic) levels, so that stat ist ical ly  
statable facts may be explained only in connection with certain 
more general models of speech production.

,4. An interference model 
The in ter fe rence  model  p resented  here cons is ts  of two parts  : 
the syntact ic  one, conta in ing  also the word- fo rmat iona l  dev ices ,  
wh ich  may be thought  of as a generat ive  dev ice  o f  the k ind 
descr ibed  by N .CHOMSKY and other generat iv i s ts ;  the second part ,  
ca l led the lexical morpheme store, is thought  of as cons is t ing  
of entr ies  "wr i t ten  down" in terms of conceptua l  symbols ,  pro-  
v ided w i th  actual  l ingu is t i c  in terpretat ions .  These " in terpreta -  
t ions",  wh ich  in a very  s impl i f ied  manner  may be ident i f ied  w i th  
words  tout court, are p icked out of the store and " f i t ted"  into 
prev ious ly  const ructed  sentence forms. In other words ,  we assume 
that the sentences  are formed accord ing  to semant ic  requ i rements  
before  the actual  words  have been chosen.  This last rout ine  goes 
on in a semi -automat ic  way,  wh ich  may be v i sua l i zed  as p ick ing  
the requ i red  lexemes - accord ing  to the entr ies  in terms of 
conceptua l  symbols  - out of a magnet ic  tape g l id ing  under  a 
read ing dev ice  of some sort. 
For the case of a b i l ingua l  speaker ,  we can imagine the procedure  
as a tape w i th  three d i f fe rent  tracks,  the midd le  one conta in -  
~ng the "ent r ies"  , the other two the respect ive  actua l  morphemes,  
in casu Dutch and French  (D and F in fig. 3). Speak ing  in one of 
the two languages  demands a sw i tch -over  to one of the externa l  
tracks.  It may be assumed that, in the case of a mono l ingua l  
Dutch speaker ,  the cel ls  conta in  the para l le l  F rench  and Dutch 
words  in an unordered  manner ,  whereas  w i th  a f rancophone a b ias  
ex ists  towards the F rench  loan-word  (e.g. co lumn \] on f ig .3 : 
ph~nom?ne > fenomeen (verschijnsel)). This exp la ins  the pred i -  
lec t ion  for loan-words  even w i th in  the l imits  of the "basic  voca-  
bu lary"  and the more so w i th  words  of low f requency .  Other  var iants  
of speech product ion  behav ior  are poss ib le ;  for ins tance  the hyper -  
cor rect  opt ion  \] ~ 1 in co lumn 2, where  the speaker  consc ious ly  
reaches  for the more  d is tant  lexeme, and the case of pure bor row-  
ing, wh ich  may be conce ived of as an automat ic  sw i tch -over  to 
the F rench  side, wherever  the Dutch track is b lank  or whenever  
the b i l ingua l ' s  competence  fai ls to furn ish a good Dutch word 
or synonym. In this process  the French lexeme is p laced in the 
cell  on the Dutch side (c f .co lumn 3 where  ~ is the lacking word) .

We assume that the word- fo rmat iona l  rules be long  to the syn- 
tact ica l  part. Thus the reshap ing  of new French bor rowings  
(cf. the loan-ad jec t ive  gebagancerd  composed of the French 
bagan~ , whose counterpar t  is lack ing in the Dutch track, 
and of two Dutch af f ixes  ge- and -d) is done in the grammat i -  
cal part  of our model .  As a matter  of fact, this assumpt ion  
is a heur i s t i c  over -s imp l i f i ca t ion ,  because  cer ta in  grammat i -  
cal morphemes  are in fact borrowed,  cf. the endings -eren, 
-at~e, -age etc. In order to exp la in  this phenomenon,  one 
could argue on the fact that in many cases whole  word - i tems 
are in t roduced  to the lexical  store and act ivate the ana logy 
mechan ism,  but this p rob lem wou ld  lead us beyond the scope 
of the present  invest igat ion .  
A code-swit~ing th~ry 
There has been  much specu la t ion  about the poss ib le  p r inc ip le  
of lexeme order in the store, some order ing  be ing  a necessary  
cond i t ion  of e f f i c ient  re -cod ing.  Much d iscuss ion ,  too, has 
8 
been devoted to the so-ca l led Z IPF- Iaw 3) . The most  conv inc ing  
exp lanat ion  was that suggested by HERDAN 4), namely  that an order -  
ing of items by decreas ing  f requency wou ld  d imin ish  the number  
of operat ions  necessary  to ident i f ie  a g iven item. "Let us ... 
assume that the arrangement of the entries is systematic accord- 
ing to frequency of occurence in descending order of frequency, 
so that the most frequent word has rank I, the second most fre- 
quent word rank 2, and so on. If in such a dictionary, that is 
one in which words are arranged in order of decreasing frequency 
and increasing order of rankj the look-up procedure is one of 
successive comparison, the word of rank r will require r look-up 
operations~ and since this word occurs - the Zipf-law assumed - 
C/r times, the total number of look-up operations required to 
locate a word is C (the constant in the Zipf-law, formulated as 
r.fr= C ). Thus for n words contained in the dictionary, nC 
look-up operations will be required. On the other hand, we know 
that for the Zipf-law the total number of occurences (the text 
length in terms of word number) and thus the total number of 
words to be searched, is given by 
I~Crdr = C lo~ n N 
It follows that the average number of look-up operations per 
word is 
An= nC/C lo~ n = n/ lo~ n 
(...) This compares favourably with the n/2 look-up operations 
which would be needed under the scheme described above, which 
makes no use of the frequency element." ) 
With in  the f ramework of our model  it wou ld  mean that the w ind-  
ing and unwind ing  of the tape takes cons iderab ly  less time t~a~L 
in the case of who l ly  random d is t r ibut ion .  The quest ion  remains 
of what pr inc ip le  under l ies  the d i f fe rent ia t ion  of i tem poss i -  
b i l i ty .  Here too, the concept  of "p igeon-ho l ing"  o~ semant ic  
in fo rmat ion  proposed by HERDAN 4)  seems to be the most  p laus ib le .  
In other words,  the "conceptua l  symbols"  do not represent  
separate p ieces of the univers de disoour8 taken at random, 
but are probab ly  ordered by some c lass i f i ca t iona l  system, 
resembl ing  the b io log ica l  c lass i f i ca t ion .  
6. Word content and entropy 
To test this hypothes is  we d iv ided the FWD mater ia l  into 
three f requency-c lasses  (group I: abso lute  f requency  \], 
group II: f requency  2 and 3, group III : f requency  above 
3) and examined the samples of these groups accord ing  to 
their  d i s t r ibut ion  w i th in  the c lass i f i ca t iona l  system 
appl ied  by L .BROUWERS in his Dutch thesaurus  HET JUISTE 
WOORD 3). The suppos i t ion  was that in the event of o rder ing  
of some kind, the d i s t r ibut ion  of items among the "content  
c lasses"  in the thesaurus (expressed as entropy and redun- 
dancy) would  be d i f fe rent  for var ious  f requency  groups, and 
fur ther ,  that in the event of the "p igeon-ho l ing"  suggested 
by HERDAN, the redundancy  should increase for groups of items 
w i th  h igher  f requenc ies .  Such an increase was in fact obser-  
ved, as the reader  can conc lude from the fo l low ing  table: 
FREQUENCY 1 
H 5.099 
R 0.15 
FREQUENCY 2-3 FREQUENCY ? 3 
4.892 4.854 
0.18 0.19 
Thus it seems that some "natural  order",  re f lec t ing  a c lass i -  
f i ca t ion  of concepts  accord ing  to their content ,  is at least 
one of the causes d i f fe rent ia t ing  the, re lat ive f requenc ies  of 
words .  This resu l t  is compat ib le  wi th  the fact that the 
d ivers i ty  of sub jec t -mat ter  (cf.\]) does not cons iderab ly  
a l ter  the growth rate of vocabu lary .  This s tatement  need not 
/o/'/~ 
/ 
,,,~f 
/ .  
It 
rule out other devices a l lowing  quick in terconnect ions  
between words  be long ing  to the same content -group  but 
d i f fe r ing  in f requency;  (cf. the so-ca l led association of 
related concepts suggested by P .A .KOLERS @).  However,  the 
bas ic  p r inc ip le  of order seems to be of a s tat i s t i ca l  kind, 
as is proved by the per fect  fit of the rank- f requency  
d i s t r ibut ion  w i th  the theoret ica l  d i s t r ibut ion  accord ing  
to the Z IPF -MANDELBROT fo rmulat ion  (of . f ig .4) .  The corre-  
lat ion coef f i c ient  between the observed and the theoret ica l  
d i s t r ibut ion  is 0.993! 
Z Consequences 
The assumed model  has lconsequences ,  wh ich  have been  empir i -  
ca l ly  tested: 
I. The assumed model ,  and espec ia l l y  the process of bZank- 
fiZl?ng of the Dutch track w i th  French morphemes,  p resuppo-  
ses that in genera l  the FWD-wr i te rs  wi l l  use a greater  number  
of fo re ign  words  than the SWD al lows.  This fact is a l ready 
apparent  f rom the overal l  percentage  of fore ign e lements  in 
FWD (cf. f ig.5) In par t i cu la r  the fore ign words  should appear  
more f requent ly  in p ropor t ion  to the increase of text - length  ) . 
The invest igat ion  of vocabu lary  growth rate has in fact 
shown that this is the case : the rat io of new fore ign words  
to the total vocabu lary  remains stable (ca. \]/ lO) unt i l  a 
vocabu lary  of 3,000 items is reached.  Thereaf te r  it increases  
considerably.  The sample descr ibed  as Part  2 
(fig. 5) conta in ing  ca .50 ,O00 words ,  has not been pre -ed i ted ;  
i.e. no o r thograph ic  mistakes  or ommiss ions  have been el imi-  
nated,  as it was done manua l ly  in Part I. Thus all o r thogra-  
phic id iosyncras ies  have been counted as new types by the 
computer .  We assume that the d i f fe rence  in the size of the 
so -ca l led  bas ic  vocabu lary  (3,000 -- 3,500) is main ly  due to 
this fact.

2. As the choice of lexemes from the store takes place in 
terms of "conceptua l  symbols",  the lexical  d ivers i ty  should 
not be substant ia l l y  d imin ished on account  of the l imited 
vocabu lary .  The b lank- f i l l i ngs  wi th  French lexemes should 
al low the f rancophones  to keep the overal l  d ivers i ty  on a 
normal  level, i.e. on that of the SWD-wr i ters .  In other 
words ,  we suppose that the greater  number of fore ign e lements  
in FWD-texts  is the consequence  of the endeavor  to "keep in 
pace" w i th  the normal  rate of language d ivers i ty .  
CONCLUSIONS 
a) The f rancophone b i l ingua ls  use more than twice as much 
words  as the mono l ingua l  nat ive speakers of Dutch. 
b) This fact is connected wi th  the tendency to keep the 
overal l  var ie ty  of vocabu lary  at a certa in  "normal"  
level of speech product ion .  This var ie ty  is a bit  
smal ler  than in the case of nat ive speakers  (cf. the 
r lo~ee_~ rat io =log N ; for FWD 0.837, for SWD 0.880). 
c) It can never the less  be descr ibed as "normal"  since the 
value of parameter  B in MANDELBROT's  fo rmulat ion  of the 
Z IPF - Iaw is \].03347. 
d) The fore ign lexemes are not equ id i s t r ibuted  in the 
assumed word store; their number increases wi th  the 
growing  text length and this increase is quite ev ident  
above the f irst  3,000 words,  This fact a l lows one to 
think of them as a "basic vocabu lary" ,  cover ing var ious 
subjects  (two d i f fe rent  mul t i - sub jec t  samples gave 
near ly  ident ica l  va lues of the basic vocabu lary) .  
e) The ex is tence of the bas ic  vocabu lary  and the good fit 
of empir ica l  data wi th  the theoret ica l  d i s t r ibut ion  
known as ZIPF- Iaw,  s t rengthens  the assumpt ion  that the 
word-un i t s  in the store are ordered.  
f) One of ?he order ing  pr inc ip les  is the p igeon-ho l ing  of 
in fo rmat ion  accord ing  to some c lass i f i ca t iona l  system 
wh ich  takes into account  the in fo rmat iona l  content  of 
words .
