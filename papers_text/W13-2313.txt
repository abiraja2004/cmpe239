Abstract 
This paper discusses the problem of annotating 
coreference relations with generic expressions 
in a large scale corpus. We present and ana-
lyze some existing theories of genericity, 
compare them to the approaches to generics 
that are used in the state-of-the-art coreference 
annotation guidelines and discuss how coref-
erence of generic expressions is processed in 
the manual annotation of the Prague Depend-
ency Treebank. After analyzing some typical 
problematic issues we propose some partial 
solutions that can be used to enhance the 
quality and consistency of the annotation. 
1 Introduction 
One of the most problematic issues of anno-
tating coreference in large scale corpora is 
processing coreference of generic expres-
sions. The decision to annotate generic noun 
phrases produces a significant decrease of inter-
annotator agreement. On the other hand, neglect-
ing coreference relations between generic ex-
pressions causes a significant loss of information 
on the text coherence that is primordially the rea-
son for annotating coreference relations at all. It 
also causes the inconsistency of annotation 
guidelines: due to relatively vague definition of 
genericity, it is almost impossible to exclude all 
coreference relations between generics from the 
annotation. 
In the Prague Dependency Treebank (hence-
forth PDT), we tried to distinguish coreference 
relations between nominal expressions with spe-
cific and generic reading. Comparing the inter-
annotator agreement for these groups shows that 
the agreement for noun coreference with specific 
reading is significantly higher than the agreement 
for the coreference of generic NPs (F1-measure 
0.705 for specific NPs and 0.492 for generics1). 
Moreover, the manual analysis of the cases of 
disagreement of specific NPs coreference 
demonstrates that most cases of disagreement are 
those where NPs in question may be interpreted 
generically. 
Having formulated a set of criteria which help 
identifying generic expressions, there still re-
mains a wide range of typical examples which 
can have generic interpretation, though not nec-
essarily. In this paper, we try to delimit the set of 
generic NPs presenting the overview of some 
existing theories of genericity (Sections 2 and 
3.1) and compare them to the stand-of-the-art 
coreference annotation guidelines (Section 3.2). 
Then we present our approach to annotating co-
reference with generic noun phrases in PDT 
where we apply the presented theories to coref-
erence and bridging relations annotation (Section 
4). We analyze typical problematic issues (Sec-
tion 5) and discuss some possible solutions (Sec-
tion 6). 
2 What are generics and can they co-
refer? 
Generic reference is a term commonly used in 
linguistic semantics to describe noun-phrase ref-
erence to kinds of things (Carlson 2005). In dif-
ferent languages, generic reference may be 
expressed by noun phrases with definite and 
indefinite articles and with determinerless 
expressions quite generally. In languages 
without articles, the determinerless form is 
typically used (Carlson 2005, Hlavsa 1975; 
Padu?eva 1985, etc.).  
                                                 
1 F1-measure for generics is closer to inter-annotator 
agreement for bridging relations (0.460 for all anno-
tated data). 
103
Compare some typical examples for generic 
noun reference (different uses of a/the dog(s)) in 
English, German and Czech: 
English:  Dogs bark ? The dog has evolved 
from the Jackal  ? A dog knows when it is time 
for his walk2.  
German: Hunde bei?en. Der Hund stammt 
vom Schakal ab. Ein Hund wei?// Hunde wissen, 
wenn es Zeit f?r seinen Spaziergang ist. 
Czech (non-article language): Psi ?t?kaj?. ? 
Pes je ?elma. 
The examples above demonstrate that generic 
noun phrases cannot be recognized by their 
forms (this fact  was pointed out in Lyons 1999, 
Carlson 2005, etc.). While in English the plural 
form of the definite can only marginally have 
generic reference, in German, which is closely 
related to English, the plural definite may imply 
generic reference quite easily. In Romance lan-
guages, the form of bare plural with generics is 
prohibited (Delfitto 2006) and even in languages 
without articles, generics with determiners are 
not so rare (see e.g. common examples with 
Czech in Nedoluzhko 2003) 3 . This leads to a 
suggestion that genericity is not a primitive cate-
gory of semantic or syntactic description. 
Theoretical studies like Carlson (1980) appeal 
to typical examples with noun phrases referring 
to specific objects. A discussion on his approach 
(Paducheva 1985, Delfitto 2006, Lyons 1999) 
concerns theoretical issues that are analyzed in 
similar typical cases. 
When analyzing real corpus examples we en-
counter a lot of cases indicating that not all ge-
neric expressions are generic in the same way. 
Problems with processing generic expressions 
arise also from the lack of a universally accepted 
theory of genericity which would be applicable 
to the real texts analysis. 
Generic reading is possible not only with re-
ferring nouns, but also with mass nouns, group 
nouns, abstract nouns, quantifiers and 
deverbatives. Look at the example (1). Everyone 
should probably agree that the homeless is a ge-
neric expression, but is the same true about the 
homeless population? 
                                                 
2  However, Carlson ?  Pelletier (1995) do not consid-
er a dog in the last sentence to be generic, because it 
cannot be combined with kind-level predicates. 
3 It may be possible to determine generics in sentenc-
es with so-called ?kind-level predicates? (Carlson 
2005), they interact with aspectual distinctions in 
verbs (Lyons 1999) etc, but these approaches are not 
applicable to real-text data. 
(1) Your comments implied we had discov-
ered that the principal cause of homeless-
ness is to be found in the large numbers of 
mentally ill and substance-abusing people 
in the homeless population. [...] The study 
shows that nearly 40% of the homeless pop-
ulation is made up of women and children 
and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits 
some combination of drug, alcohol and 
mental problems4. 
Another relevant question is if generic ex-
pressions referring to the same kind can be 
considered coreferent in the same sense as 
noun phrases with a specific reading. Ac-
cording to Carlson?s (1980) and Lyons? (1999) 
claim, generics refer to classes in the similar way 
as proper names refer to unique entities. In this 
sense, coreference of generic expressions appears 
to be obvious. On the other hand, Carlson?s ob-
servations seem to be quite language-specific. 
Arguing against a quantificational analysis of 
bare plurals with generic meaning, he claims that 
the sentence Miles wants to meet policemen can-
not be assigned a reading according to which 
?there are certain policemen that Miles wants to 
meet,? whereas this interpretation is naturally 
available in the case of Miles wants to meet some 
policemen. This is not the case of languages 
without articles where plural forms can be as-
signed any reading regardless of the use of the 
quantifier5. Generally, we suppose that quantifi-
cational (or predicative) interpretation of generic 
expressions in different languages is not impos-
sible (see for example almost obligatory predica-
tive reading of Czech exporters in (7)). However, 
this fact does not necessarily exclude the coref-
erence relation between them. Eventually, the 
discourse deixis as reference to events is also 
often considered and annotated as coreference. 
3 Recent research on generics 
We believe that it would not be a strong exag-
geration to claim that theoretical and computa-
tional linguistics have different goals as concerns 
their approach to genericity. The challenge of 
linguistic research is to find out more about the 
essence of genericity. The aim of annotating is to 
                                                 
4 The example comes from the Prague English De-
pendency Treebank (PEDT, Haji? et al 2009) 
5 Actually, even in English not all bare plurals should 
necessarily refer to kinds. In modern journalistic texts, 
the tendency to omit articles appears to be quite 
strong.

make the group of generics as clear as possible, 
in order to  reach higher agreement and better 
results of automatic processing. 
It is also generally known that the features of 
an annotation must be adapted to the task it is 
designed for. However, the existing large-scale 
annotated corpora (especially those prepared on 
university basis) are often meant to be multi-
purpose. They serve both as train data for (dif-
ferent!) automatic tasks and as a rich manually 
annotated material for linguistic research.  
In what follows, we complete the theoretical 
overview (started in section 2), present the anno-
tation approach and look for the common points. 
3.1 Linguistic research 
There is a rich variety of linguistic approaches to 
genericity. Even as concerns the terminology 
with generics, it is quite inconsistent and cannot 
be relied on with much certainty. According to 
different researchers, generic NPs are considered 
to be either referring to classes (Carlson ?  Pelle-
tier 1995, Mendoza 2004) or non-referring (ra-
ther predicating) classifications over kinds 
(Paducheva 1985), beeing able to have specific 
and non-specific interpretation (Mendoza 2004, 
Smelev 1996) and divided from non-specific NPs 
as a separate group (Carlson ?  Pelletier 2005, 
Paducheva 1985). 
Carlson (1980) represents the most influential 
approach to genericity that has been elaborated 
in the framework of formal semantics and gener-
ative grammar. Calson?s hypothesis is that gener-
ics are kind-referring expressions, roughly names 
for kinds, as opposed to individual-referring ex-
pressions that refer to individuals or groups of 
individuals. In his approach, there is a difference 
between generic reference and individual non-
specific reference, i.e. reference to an open set of 
individual objects. For example, NP lions that 
have toothaches is not generic, its reference is 
individual (i.e. non-generic) and non-specific, 
which can be demonstrated by the fact that it 
cannot be substituted by the definite NP the lion 
that has toothache (such NP can have only indi-
vidual reading). However, the problem with this 
criterion is that it is clearly language-specific (it 
cannot be applied at all to Czech, for instance). 
3.2 Annotation coreference with generic 
expression 
Let?s now have a look on how generic NPs are 
processed in annotation projects with anaphoric 
and coreference annotation. 
In some projects, e.g. ARRAU and other corpora 
based on the MATE coreference annotation 
scheme (Poesio 2004), genericity is marked as a 
part of lexico-semantical information of the noun 
(an attribute generic-yes/no/undersp is 
applied to each noun). This information is con-
templated in the annotation of identical corefer-
ence.  Identical coreference for generics is also 
annotated in AnCora (Recasens 2010) and PDT 
(Nedoluzhko 2011).  
In other projects, annotation of coreference 
with generic NPs may be excluded from annota-
tion schemes that are geared towards a reliable 
annotation of large text quantities. For example, 
generics are not annotated for coreference in On-
tonotes (Pradhan et al 2007), T?BA-DZ (Hin-
richs et al 2004) and PoCoS (Krasavina-
Chiarchos 2007).  
However, even if an annotation scheme ex-
plicitly says that coreference of generic NPs is 
not annotated, there are some borderline cases 
where coreference can still be annotated quite 
systematically. So, T?BA annotates coreference 
with the nominal expression if it appears repeat-
edly in the text with the same interpretation. In 
Ontonotes, the explicit anaphora with it in the 
anaphoric position is commonly annotated for 
coreference: 
(2) Still, any change in East Germany has 
enormous implications, for both East and 
West. It raises the long-cherished hopes of 
many Germans for reunification6. 
Furthermore, systematic exclusion of generic 
expressions from the annotation will force the 
coders not to mark the cases like (3) and (4)7. 
From the point of view of applied tasks and au-
tomatic coreference resolvers it will lead to the 
loss of relevant information and to an essential 
complification of automatic tools. 
(3) The sterilizing gene is expressed just be-
fore the pollen is about to develop and it 
deactivates the anthers of every flower in 
the plant. Mr. Leemans said this genetic 
manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that 
plant. 
(4) A workshop needs to be planned careful-
ly. Otherwise it may turn in a disaster. 
As far as we know, there are no significant 
projects for annotating coreference separately for 
                                                 
6 This example is taken from PEDT, to which the On-
tonotes coreference was applied.

pressions.  
4 Coreference annotation in Prague 
Dependency Treebank 
In this section we describe how generic expres-
sions (or more precisely, what we decided to 
consider generic expressions) are annotated in 
the Prague Dependency Treebank.  
Annotation of coreference and discourse rela-
tions is a project related to the Prague Dependen-
cy Treebank 2.5 (PDT; Bej?ek et al 2011). It 
represents a new manually annotated layer of 
language description, above the existing layers of 
the PDT (morphology, analytic syntax and tecto-
grammatics) and it captures linguistic phenome-
na from the perspective of discourse structure 
and coherence. This special layer of the treebank 
consists of annotation of nominal coreference 
and bridging relations (Nedoluzhko et al 2009), 
discourse connectives, discourse units linked by 
them and semantic relations between these units 
(Mladov? 2011).  
Considering the fact that Czech has no definite 
article (hence no formal possibility to exclude 
non-anaphoric coreference), our annotation is 
aimed at coreference relations regardless to their 
anaphoricity. 
Coreference relations are marked for noun 
phrases with specific and generic reference sepa-
rately ? coreference of specific noun phrases ? 
type SPEC, coreference of generic noun phrases 
? type GEN8.  Bridging relations, which mark 
some semantic relations between non-
coreferential entities, are also annotated in PDT. 
The following types of bridging relations are dis-
tinguished: PART-OF (e.g. room - ceiling), 
SUBSET (students - some students) and FUNCT 
(state - president) traditional relations, CON-
TRAST for coherence relevant discourse oppo-
sites (this year - last year), ANAF for explicitly 
anaphoric relations without coreference or one of 
the semantic relations mentioned above (rainbow 
- that word) and the further underspecified group 
REST9.  
As seen from the point of view of the annotat-
ed groups, generic NPs are explicitly marked 
                                                 
8 The reason for this decision is the lack of semantic 
information assigned to nouns themselves, as it is 
done e.g. for Gnome in MATE sceme (Poesio 2004). 
9  For detailed classification of identity coreference 
and bridging relations used in PDT, see e.g. Ne-
doluzhko et al 2011. 
only with the second element of the coreference 
relation. However, this distinction remains un-
registered by bridging relations. Moreover, it 
appears to be possible (and even not so uncom-
mon) that a coreference relation was annotated 
between a generic and a non-generic noun 
phrase. These cases are interpreted as either (lin-
guistically) ambiguous or insufficiently classified 
by the guidelines. For example, in (5), the specif-
ic noun phrase tento n?rod (=this nation) is core-
ferent with generic plural Romy (=the Gipsies): 
(5) Nic z toho se v?ak nevyrovn? m??e 
ne?t?st?, kter? Romy postihlo v letech druh? 
sv?tov? v?lky. Spolu se ?idy byli ozna?eni 
za m?n?cennou rasu a stali se objektem pa-
tologick?ch fa?istick?ch opat?en?, jejich? c?-
lem byla ?pln? genocida tohoto n?roda. (= 
Nothing of this, however, compares to the 
misfortune that befell the Gipsies during the 
Second World War. Together with the Jews, 
they were called an inferior race and be-
came the object of pathological fascist 
measures, their purpose being the complete 
genocide of the nation.) 
Annotation rules for generics in PDT are de-
scribed in detail in sections 4.1-4.3. 
4.1 Type coreference of generic NPs 
Coreference relations between the same types 
are annotated as coreference of generic NPs (at-
tribute coref_text, type GEN). Cf. (6) 
where antecedent generic drug is pronominalized 
in the anaphoric position: 
(6) Droga je tedy tak ??inn?, ?e ten, kdo ji  
u??v?, se snadno dostane do ?pohody? kou-
?en?m nebo ??up?n?m. (= The drug is so ef-
fective that the person who takes it can easi-
ly achieve the state of ?coolness? by smok-
ing or snorting.) 
The ?generic coreference? is more frequent for 
plural forms (7): 
(7) Nov? striktn? omezen? vl?dy SR proti 
?esk?m export?r?m. Ji? n?kolik dn? je v?eo-
becn? zn?mo, ?e ochran??sk? opat?en? slov-
ensk? vl?dy proti ?esk?m export?r?m se 
dot?kaj? zejm?na oblasti obchodu s po-
travinami a zem?d?lsk?mi produkty. (= The 
new Slovak government's strict restrictions 
on Czech exporters. It?s commonly known 
for several days that protective measures of 
Slovakia's government against Czech ex-
porters apply mostly to the trade of food 
and agricultural products.) 
106
Textual coreference of type GEN is also anno-
tated for the majority of abstract nouns (see more 
detail in Section 5.5), cf. (8): 
(8) T?mto faktorem je podnikatel-inov?tor, 
kter? se sna?? o zisk, a proto logicky nem??e 
existovat ve stavu statiky, kter? nezn? ani 
zisk, ani ztr?tu. (= This factor is the enter-
preneur-innovator, who is trying to gain 
profit, and hence, logically, cannot exist in 
a static state, where there is no profit or 
loss.) 
4.2. Classes and subclasses 
The relation ?category ? sub-category? is 
marked as a bridging relation of the SUBSET 
type. Cf. (9).  
(9) I kdy? konzervativn? Anglie jeho ?in od-
soudila, ? Brit?nie se pro ?v?ka?ku stala 
br?nou do Evropy. Je?t? jeden miln?k si 
zaslou?? zm?nku ? zrod bublinov? ?v?ka?ky 
(= Although conservative England did not 
accept it, ... for the gum, Britain has become 
the gateway to Europe. Another milestone is 
worth mentioning, that is the birth of a bub-
ble gum.) 
Annotating the SUBSET relation with generic 
expressions appears to be quite a serious prob-
lem. This relation has a different meaning com-
pared to the SUBSET relation of noun phrases 
with specific reading. However, such relations 
may be quite relevant for cohesion.  
4.3 The relation ?type ? entity? 
If a specific mention is used in the text af-
ter a generic mention (or the contrary), the 
relation between them is annotated as a 
bridging relation of the SUBSET type. Cf. (10): 
(10) Nov? VW Golf je vybaven motorem 
o s?le... Dostali jsme mo?nost se nov?m 
golfem projet. (= The new VW Golf is 
equipped with an engine power ... We 
had an opportunity to ride a new golf.) 
Similar, but not the same is the relation be-
tween a set of specific objects and a non-specific 
element in (11): 
(11) [volont??i] Absolvovali ?kolen? v prvn? 
pomoci pro ?lov?ka v nouzi . [?]Kdy? d?t? 
zavol?, dostane bu? radu hned, nebo si s 
n?m volont?r domluv? dal?? hovor. (=The 
volunteers have been trained in first aid for 
people in need. [...] When a child calls, it 
will get get an advice immediately, or a vol-
unteer will arrange a meeting with him.) 
5 Problem cases with generics in PDT 
Although the cases presented in sections 4.1-4.3 
do not look very reliable, they are still consid-
ered to be relatively clear as compared to what 
follows in 5.1 -5.6.  The decisions made in anno-
tation guidelines for these cases are often case-
sensitive, might be in some cases contra-
intuitive, and they result in high inter-annotator 
disagreement. 
5.1 Non-generic non-specific NPs 
In case of non-generic non-specific noun 
phrases, when antecedent and anaphoric noun 
phrases have the same t-lemmas and the same 
scope, but anaphoric NP does not have a deter-
miner, coreference of type GEN is annotated. 
Although this kind of relation does not contribute 
much to text coherence, we still tend to mark this 
relation, also for the reason that the border be-
tween what should be annotated and what should 
not is not always easy to determine.  
(12) Kdy? si d?t? bude p??t, aby se o jeho 
probl?mu nikdo z rodiny nebo ?koly ne-
dozv?d?l, mus?me to respektovat, vysv?tluje 
Jana Drtilov? . [?] V?t?inou se st?v?, ?e 
d?t? ani nechce, aby se rodina  dozv?d?la, ?e 
se n?m ozval. Linka by nem?la rodinu 
nahrazovat, ale dopl?ovat. (= If a child de-
sires that no one from the family or school 
would find out about his problems, we have 
to respect that, says Jana Drtilova. [?] It is 
usually the case that the child does not even 
want for the family to know that he contact-
ed us.  The hotline should not replace the 
family, but to supplement it.)  
There are also cases of non-specific non-
generic NPs the referential value of which is 
provided by syntactic factors. These are so-called 
contexts with removed assertiveness, e.g. sen-
tences with modal verbs (can, want, need), im-
perative sentences, future tense, questions, nega-
tions, disjunctions, irreality, uncertainty and so 
on. Non-specific NPs are often used with per-
formative verbs, propositional attitudes (want, 
think, consider) and some constructions as e.g. in 
English such as, in Czech jde o (=lit. It is about), 
takov? X (=such X), etc. These contexts can give 
a non-specific reading to an expression, even if it 
actually has a specific meaning. Cf (13), where  
107
(13) Ale jedna v?c je jist? - pal?c bude 
stavebn? p?ed?v?n letos na podzim. [?] 
Provoz tak obrovsk? budovy p?ijde ro?n? 
na des?tky milion? korun. (=lit. But one 
thing is certain ? the reconstruction of 
the palace will be finished this fall. [...] It 
will cost tens of millions crowns, to run 
such a huge building.) 
5.2 Borderline cases between coreference of 
specific and generic NPs 
In some cases, it is hard to decide if a noun 
phrase has a specific or a generic reading. Most-
ly, both interpretations are possible. There are no 
firm rules for an unambiguous assignment of the 
types in those cases; the type is chosen on the 
basis of the available context and the annotator?s 
consideration. Uncertainty of the choice between 
generic and specific reference is common with 
some typical groups of noun phrases, first of all 
with those that have or may have modifications. 
Cf. po?ad (=TV show) in (14) that may have a 
temporal modification. The obligatoriness of this 
modification influences the annotator?s decision 
if (s)he should read it as a generic or a specific 
NP. For this case, the specific reading was cho-
sen.  
(14) K t?matu po?adu TV NOVA TABU 
?Zrak za b?lou h?l? byl p?izv?n ke kon-
zultaci Old?ich ??lek. Kate?ina Hamrov?, 
dramaturgyn? po?adu, TV NOVA. (= To 
consult the topic of the TV NOVA show TA-
BU "Vision for a white cane", Ulrich ??lek 
was invited. Catherine Hamrov?, the dram-
atist of the show, TV NOVA) 
Also, for example for (15), the detergent Toto 
can be understood as a specific (a name for a de-
tergent brand) or generic (the type of the deter-
gent of such brand). Also in this case, the specif-
ic reference is preferred in PDT: 
(15) U detergentu Toto jsme nap??klad ?e?ili 
probl?m s udr?en?m st?l? kvality, proto?e 
jednotliv? partie byly nevyv??en?. In-
vestovali jsme dva miliony korun do n?kupu 
p?sov?ch vah, zp?esnili d?vkov?n? a jakost 
prac?ho pr??ku stabilizovali. (=For exam-
ple, with the Toto detergent we face prob-
lems with maintaining consistent quality... 
We invested two million crowns... and stabi-
lized the quality of the detergent. ) 
5.3 Borderline cases between coreference of 
generic NPs and zero relation 
There is also a borderline between the cases of 
coreference of the generic NPs and the cases 
where it makes no sense to mark a coreferential 
relation. We do not annotate ?generic corefer-
ence? if noun phrases have different scope (i.e. 
they refer to different sets of objects), e.g. ?eny 
(= women) ? ?eny v 19. stolet? (= women in 19th 
century). In this case, the bridging relation of the 
type SUBSET is annotated instead. In other 
problematic cases, annotators usually apply to 
their intuition and the text coherence. If both say 
no, no coreference is annotated. 
5.4 Coreference with measure NPs and oth-
er NPs with a ?container? meaning 
In PDT, a special group of numerals and 
nouns with a ?container? meaning is singled out. 
They  have  the  modification  in  their  valency  
frames denoting  the  content  (people,  things,  
substance etc.) of a container expressed by the 
governing noun. These ?container? expressions 
are e.g. nouns and numerals denoting groups, 
number or amount, sets, collections, portions, 
etc. (skupina lid? (=group of people), po?et akci? 
(=number of stocks), st?do krav (=herd of cows), 
dostatek financ? (=abundance of finance), 
mili?ny ?id? (=millions of Jews), sklenice piva 
(=glass of beer), deset procent obyvatel (=ten 
percent of population)). 
The PDT convention on annotating corefer-
ence by NPs with a ?container? meaning follows 
the maximum-scope rule, i.e., if possible, the 
governing (?container?) node is linked by a co-
reference link (16). The modifications of con-
tainers may be coreferential themselves inde-
pendently of the ?containers? (17) 
(16) Absolutn? v?t?ina lid? z?visl?ch na her-
oinu je p??li? mlad? na to, aby si #PersPron 
pamatovala rozklad a zesl?blost generace 
sedmdes?t?ch let, tak?e odvr?cenou str?nku 
?fantastick?ho? ?ivota si #PersPron 
mnohdy v?bec neuv?dom?. (=Absolute ma-
jority of people addicted to heroin is too 
young to remember the decomposition and 
enfeeblement of the generation of seventies, 
so they (lit. ?she? referring to ?majority?) do

life.)

108
ple from the seventies, there were only 3-4 
percent of pure raw material. Currently, 
one can get packages containing up to 80 
percent of pure heroin.) 
Coreference of ?containers? can be problemat-
ic from the point of view of their generic or spe-
cific interpretation. Nouns referring to groups 
may refer generically to the elements belonging 
to that group or specifically to the group itself. In 
the following example, there has been a disa-
greement between annotators concerning the ge-
neric/specific reading of the NP skupina 
(=group). We believe that this kind of disagree-
ment could be solved by separating the group of 
non-specific non-generic references. 
(18) Podle v?zkum? ve vysp?l?ch zem?ch se

search in the developed countries, there are 
many more people who need special ser-
vices. In our country, the group of such 
people would count about 70,000 individu-
als. They are mainly older people sighted 
and visually impaired. This group is com-
pletely off, their life being even more diffi-
cult, because they don?t even know about 
many of these services.) 
More complicated are the cases where coref-
erence chains for ?containers? and their modifica-
tions intersect. In (19), a coreference link for the 
strikers in b. should lead to three and a half 
thousand workers but in c., the number of strik-
ers changes, so the container modification work-
ers should be marked as coreferent with the 
strikers in b. For such cases, coreference of type 
GEN is used in PDT. 
(19) a. T?? a p?l tis?ce d?ln?k? vyhl?sili

st?vkuj?c?ch m??e zdvojn?sobit. (a. Three 
and a half thousand workers went on strike. 
b. The strikers demand six percent of salary 
increase. c. By 8 March, the number of 
strikers may double.)  
However, in this case, the problem is rather 
specific. Here, po?et st?vkuj?c?ch  (=the number 
of strikers) does not actually refer to the strikers 
(as it would e.g. in tis?c st?vkuj?c?ch (=thousand 
strikers) but to the number itself and that is the 
reason for coreference annotation to strikers. In 
such cases, the number does not serve as a ?con-
tainer? in proper sense. 
5.5 Coreference with abstract nouns 
Processing coreference of abstract nouns 
seems to be in some respects close to that of ge-
nerics. Abstract nouns do not refer to a type, but 
to a notion. However, this notion is unique in the 
same way as type is unique to the generic ex-
pression which refers to it. Moreover, abstract 
nouns are close to predicative and quantification-
al interpretation and there are no formal rules 
distinguishing them from concrete NPs and 
deverbatives. They also result in high ambiguity 
when annotated for coreference. 
There have been several changes in the guide-
lines for the annotation of coreference and bridg-
ing relations with abstract nouns. Finally, we 
decided to distinguish between ?specific? and 
?generic? abstracts. If subjects to annotation 
have complements with specific reference, or 
they have unambiguously specific reference 
themselves, coreference between them is anno-
tated as textual coreference, type SPEC (20). In 
case of even a little doubt, we annotate textual 
coreference, type GEN (8).

1991?1993 zna?n? zaostal za poklesem

conditions of the Czech economy the growth

percent growth of the Czech economy.) 
5.6 Coreference with verbal nouns 
With verbal nouns, both specifying and gener-
ic reference are possible as well. Textual corefer-
ence with verbal nouns is annotated according to 
the following strategy: 
- If both verbal nouns are specific, they re-
fer to a specific situation and their possi-
ble arguments are coreferential, the rela-
tion between them is annotated as textual 
coreference, type SPEC, cf. (21); 
- If both verbal nouns are generic, or rather 
if their arguments are generic, the relation 
between them is annotated as textual co-
reference, type GEN. Cf. (22); 
- If both verbal nouns are specific, but their 
arguments are not coreferential, coreferen-
109
tial relation between them is not annotat-
ed.; 
- If one verbal noun is specific and the other 
is generic, coreferential relation between 
them is not annotated.

surance company was not included among

hough it provides this service. We apologize

(= Fast, yet safe transaction. According to 
Ji??ho B?r?s opinion, the speed of transac-
tion corresponds to the needs.) 
However, such instructions are quite ambigu-
ous themselves, because, firstly, it is not always 
clear, what a specific verbal noun means and, 
secondly and most importantly, verbal nouns 
may have more than one argument, one of them 
being generic and other ? specific (Pergler 2010). 
Moreover, deverbatives themselves may refer to 
specific events that has already happened (thus 
tending to type SPEC if coreferent) or to hypo-
thetic or typical ones (then, in case of corefer-
ence, marked as GEN). 
6 Discussion 
Processing coreference of generic expressions, 
even in manual annotation, raises a number of 
problems, both theoretical and the applied, like 
complification of coreference resolving. As we 
have seen, the problem of generics is very lan-
guage-specific. Each resolving system trying to 
process coreference for generics will have to be 
oriented towards the specific linguistic descrip-
tion of the language in question. But even so, 
there are many possibilities of expressing generic 
expressions in every language, thus making the 
formal problem of extracting generics even in 
one separate language extremely difficult. 
 Generic expressions are analyzed relatively in 
more detail for English (Carlson 1980, Carlson -  
Pelletier 1995). However, this research relies 
heavily on language forms, it is not based on a 
large-scale corpus and it seems to be too theoret-
ical to be easily adapted to a large corpus (manu-
al or automatic) processing. On the other hand, 
Carlson?s classification of the reference reading 
of nouns could be used in practice for the distinc-
tion between generic and non-specific non-
generic NPs. Using our experience, we believe 
that it would make the annotation more con-
sistent: there would be less ambiguity between 
specific and generic readings. However, being 
helpful in resolving the cases from section 5.1, 
this decision would not resolve the majority of 
the remaining problematic cases. There still re-
main borderline cases with specific noun expres-
sions with possible valency frames (see 5.2), co-
reference with abstract and verbal nouns and so 
on. Separating the group of NPs with non-
specific reading, the coders should concentrate 
on quite specific semantic issues when annotat-
ing. Moreover, annotating more groups of nouns 
is always a costly and time-consuming task. 
From the theoretical point of view, one could 
imagine a scale: from noun expressions with 
concrete meaning and specific reading (say 
named entities) up to abstract nouns and 
deverbatives with generic reading. However, 
such an approach will not help to process generic 
NPs in large-scale corpora. 
7 Conclusion 
In this paper, we discussed the problem of anno-
tating coreference with generic expressions. 
Considering theoretical approaches has revealed 
that they tend to be very language specific. State-
of-the-art in annotating coreference relations for 
generic NPs needs unification but this is compli-
cated, as the formal representation of genericity 
differs dramatically from language to language 
and can be hardly unified. We have presented an 
approach to annotation of generic expressions in 
PDT and analyzed some typical problematic ex-
amples. We consider this issue to be far from 
being solved. Both, theoretical research and large 
data approaches should be further investigated.
