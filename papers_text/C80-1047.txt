Summary 
The purpose of this study is to 
analyze the statistical property of 
Japanese characters for computer pro- 
cessing. Sentences in high school text- 
books and newspapers have been investi- 
gated in this study. This paper con- 
tains the following points : the number 
of different words written in each char- 
acter, position of characters in a word, 
relation between word boundaries and 
character strings, relation between 
parts of speech and patterns of charac- 
ter strings, relation between parts of 
speech and each character. 
The results of these investigations 
can be applied to the processing of 
written Japanese for practical purpose. 
i. Introduction 
There are several different aspects 
between Eng l i sh  and Japanese in the 
information processing of natural lan- 
guage. The first concerns the number of 
characters. In order to write Japanese 
more than 2,000 characters are used. 
The second concerns the way of writing. 
A Japanese sentence consists of a con- 
tinuous character string without any 
space between words. The third concerns 
word order and other syntactic features. 
Among these aspects, the second and 
third features are closely related to 
the characters. 
Japanese characters consist of 
three kinds. A KANJI(Chinese character) 
is used to write nouns and the principal 
part of a predicate, and expresses the 
concepts contained in the sentence. 
A HIRAGANA (traditional Japanese char- 
acter) is used to write conjunctions, 
adverbs, JODOSHI (mainly expresses many 
modalit ies of a predicate) and JOSHI 
(post-position, mainly expresses case 
relations). A KATAKANA (traditional 
Japanese character) is used mainly as 
phonetic signs to write foreign words. 
Accordingly, Japanese characters 
are regarded as elements of words, at 
the same time, they function to charac- 
terize the syntactic or semantic classes 
of words and express word boundaries in 
a character string. 
The following Japanese character 
strings, (A) to (D), are the same sen- 
tenCes written by using KANJI to dif- 
ferent degrees. 
(D) is quoted from a high school text- 
book (world history). 
While (A), (B) and (C) are transliterated 
from (D) by computer. 1,2

(A) is wr i t ten in KATAKANA (only for 
' ~--D~,~ ') and HIRAGANA (the rests) 
without using KANJI. 
(B) is wr i t ten in HIRAGANA, KATAKANA 
and 200 KANJI of high f requency in 
Japanese writ ing. 
(C) is wr i t ten in HIRAGANA, KATAKANA 
and the so-cal led educat ional  KANJI 
(996 characters) .  
Low graders in e lementary school 
tend to write sentences like (A). The 
older they get the more KANJI  they learn 
and they begin to write sentences like 
(D) in high school. When we read sen- 
tences like (A), we real ize it is very 
d i f f icu l t  to read them, because we can- 
not find word boundar ies  easi ly. On the 
other hand, in (B), (C) and (D) we find 
less d i f f i cu l ty  in this order. Because 
we can easi ly  find out word boundar ies 
by means of KANJI in a character  string. 
Boundar ies  between a HIRAGANA part and a 
KANJI part play a role to indicate word 
boundar ies  in many cases. We can also 
grasp main concepts  in a sentence by 
focusing our attent ion to the KANJI 
parts of the sentence. 
Therefore,  it is very important to 
use HIRAGANA and KANJI appropr ia te ly  in 
a character  string. It is, however, hard 
to say the rules for the appropr iate  use 
of H IRAGANA and KANJI have been estab- 
l ished. Due to the fact, it is necessary 
for us to study more about the actual  
use of Japanese characters.  Because, 
expl icat ion of rules for the appropr iate 
use of the characters  is a prerequis i te  
for informat ion process ing in commonly  
wr i t ten Japanese.  
2. Out l ine of Japanese characters  
Fig. l  i l lustrates the rate of total 
characters  conta ined in the high school 
textbooks (9 subjects X 1/20 sampling).  
The data conta ins  48,096 characters  in 
total. 3 HIRAGANA occupies the first 
place account ing for 47.1%. Accord ing to 
the result of Nakano's  study which wi l l  
be presented here, KANJI  takes the f irst 
place in the newspaper,  because they 
have TV-programs and mini  adver t i sement  
which are both wr i t ten main ly  in KANJI. 4 
Fig.2 i l lustrates the rate of dif-  
ferent characters  in the data of text- 
books. The data conta ins  1,525 d i f ferent  
characters.  KATAKANA and HIRAGANA are 
composed of basic 47 characters  respec- 
t ively, however the data also contains 
var iat ions  like small letters and let- 
ters with special  symbols, and both kind 
of KANA exceed 70. Most of H IRAGANA and 
KATAKANA were appeared in the data of 
textbooks. The data contains 1,312 dif-  
ferent KANJI. The more data is invest i -  
gated the more KANJI appear, and the 
rate of KANJI increases in the graph.

Accord ing to the invest igat ion of Nomura 
3,213 KANJI were found in the newspaper~ 
The largest Japanese KANJI d ic t ionary  
(edited by Morohashi) conta ins  about 
50,000 characters.6 
Fig.3 shows relat ion between fre- 
quency and order of f requency in every 
kind of characters.  From Fig.3 we see 
that a few HIRAGANA have high frequency. 
They play an important role in wri t ing 
grammat ica l  e lements in a sentence as 
JOSHI and JODOSHI.

3. Number of d i f ferent  words 
wr i t ten in each character  
As we have more than 50,000 charac-  
ters, it is necessary  to dec ide the 
degree  of importace of them. In order 
to decide the degrees two cr i ter ia  are 
assumed here. One is the f requency of 
the characters .  The other one i s the  
number of d i f ferent  words in which the 
same character  is used. The similar 
concept  has been proposed by A. Tanaka. 7 
In Fig.5, axis X represents  the 
f requency of the character  as f irst cr i -  
terion. Axis  Y represents  the number of 
d i f ferent  words in which the same char-  
acter is used. The graph shows the 
d i s t r ibut ion  of characters  in the text- 
books except KANJI.  Each character  on 
Y=I is used for only  one word. For in- 
stance, H IRAGANA ' & ' (o) on Y=i is used 
for only one word (one of case- JOSHI ,  
indicat ing accusat ive case) exclus ively.  
Each character  on Y=X is used for a new 
word in every occurrence of the char-  
acter.

KATAKANA appear near Y=X, because 
KATAKANA are main ly  used for wr i t ing 
proper nouns of foreign words. The same 
words of such a category do not appear 
frequentry.  
HIRAGANA,'  ~ ' (ru),' ~ ' ( i ) , '~ ' ( sh i ) ,  
'~  '(tsu), ' ~ '(ka) and ' < '(ku) are lo- 
cal ized on the upper r ight side. These 
are often used for wr i t ing some parts of 
inf lect ional  forms of verbs (e.g. ' %~' 
for ' ~ ', ' D' for ' 5~ ~ ', ' ~ '  for 
' ~ ' ) .  ' ~)'(i), ' ~ ' (ka)  and ' < ' 
(ku) are also often used for wr i t ing 
some parts  of in f lect ional  forms of 
adject ives.  ' ~ '(no), ' ?:'(ni), ' % ' (o ) ,  
' ~ '(wa), ' a '(to), ' ~'(ga) and '~'(de) 
on the r ight side are f requent ly  used 
for JOSHI (post-posit ion,  express ing-  
case re lat ions or other grammat ica l  re- 
lat ions).  '~ '(ta) on the upper r ight 
side is often used for JODOSHI of the 
past tense. ' ~ '(na) on the upper r ight 
side is often used for the init ial  syl- 
lable of JODOSHI of negative.  
Fig.6 and Fig.7 show the same in- 
vest igat ion  into the KANJI  of newspapers  
(the or ig inal  work was carr ied out by 
Nomura).5 
Fig.6 shows the d is t r ibut ion  of (y) 
the so-cal led "TOYOKANJI"  selected by 
the Japanese government  for dai ly  use in 
1946. The upper r ight area on the graph I~8 
is occupied by the so-cal led educat iona l  % 
KANJI. Each KANJI on Y=i is used only 
for one word (e.g. '~ '(tai) for '~{~' 
(taiho : arrest),  ' ~ '(bou) for ' ~ '  
(boueki : trade), '~  '(kai) for '~ '  
(kikai : machine)) .  The same as Fig.5, 
characters  used for persons' names are 
local ized near Y=X. 
Fig.7 shows the d is t r ibut ion  of 5~ 
KANJI other than TOYOKANJI .  The most  of 
characters  in upper r ight part of the 
graph are the ones which are used for 
persons' names or for place names. (e.g. 
'~  ' and ' ~'  for '~  ' (Euj isaki :person) 
' ~ '  for '~ '  (Fukuoka:place).  
4. Pos i t ion of characters  in a word 
For the informat ion process ing of 
Japanese sentences,  at first, it is im- 
portant  to f ind out word boundar ies  in a 
cont inuous character  string. If there 
are some characters  which always come to 
the init ial  pos i t ion or the f inal posi -  
t ion of a word, these characters  are 
avai lab le  to f ind the boundaries.  
Fig.8 shows the pos i t ion of charac-  
ters in words. In the data of textbooks,  
there are 399 characters  which are used 
for more than 6 kinds of d i f ferent  
words. The characters  on X=i00 always 
come to the init ial  pos i t ion of a word. 
The characters  on X=0 are never used at 
the init ial  posit ion.  The characters  on 
Y=i00 always come to the  f inal pos i t ion 
of a word. The characters  on Y=0 are 
never used at the f inal posit ion.  
KANJI, represented with dots, spread 
over the area of Y~-X+i00 .  Namely, the 
value of X+Y are always greater  than or 
equal to i00~ In other words, rates of 
the init ial  pos i t ion plus f inal pos i t ion 
are always greater than or equal to 100%. 
It means that all KANJI  have a tendency 
to be used for the init ial  pos i t ion or 
the f inal pos i t ion or both pos i t ion (as 
a word of one character) of a word 
(short unit *). Most KANJI  on Y = -X+100 
form only words of two KANJI. The tend- 
ency or ig inates  in the compos i t ion  of 
words wr i t ten by KANJI. This matter  wil l  
be observed in sect ion 6. The group of 
H IRAGANA in the upper right area has a 
tendency to be used for JOSHI. KATAKANA 
represented by '~' appear around the 
under left area on the graph. Words 
wr i t ten in KATAKANA have re lat ive ly  long 
length (See sect ion 6). Therefore,  the 
rates of the init ial  pos i t ion and the 
f inal pos i t ion are re lat ivery  decreased.

5. Relat ion between word boundar ies 
and character  str ings 
(Simple Japanese grammar) 
N, J iN2J  ~ ... V. (i) 
Ni: Noun 
Ji : Case- JOSHI  for N~ 
V : Verb 
A Japanese sentence fundamenta l ly  
belongs to pattern (i). Many nouns (Ni) 
tend to be wr i t ten in KANJI (See next 
section).  Al l  the case- JOSHI  are writ -  
ten in HIRAGANA. Stems of verbs are often 
wr i t ten in KANJI  and their inf lect ional  
parts in HIRAGANA. So both a phrase of 
N~J& and V have such a pattern that the 
init ial  pos i t ion is occupied by a KANJI 
and the f inal pos i t ion is occupied by a 
HIRAGANA. Therefore,  the changing point 
from HIRAGANA to KANJI  in a character  
string is always regarded as a word 
boundary. On the other hand, a word 
boundary is not always a changing point 
from HIRAGANA to KANJI. One of the 
except ion is Japanese nouns (long unit) 
which are composed of some concatenat ion  
of nouns (short unit). (See page 5 *) 
Fig.9 shows one of the re lat ions 
between word boundar ies  and character  
strings. The graph conta ins  902 KANJI 
(total : 1,546) in the textbooks. The ax- 
is X represents  the rate that the chan- 
ging points from HIRAGANA to KANJI  cor- 
respond to word boundaries.  Each KANJI 
on X=i00 is cons idered as the init ial  
character  of a word if it is preceeded 
by a HIRAGANA. The axis Y represents  the 
rate that the word boundar ies correspond 
to changing points from HIRAGANA to KAN- 
JI. The symbol of '~' represents  a KANJI.

The length of d iagonal  of '~' is propor-  
t ionate to the f requency of the KANJI. 
In the graph, the length of 10% of axis 
is equal to i00 t imes of the frequency. 
6. Parts of speech and patterns  
of character  str ings 
In the invest igat ion of newspapers,  
20 parts of speech were assumed. 8 Each 
part of speech has a part icu lar  pattern 
of character  str ings. It is poss ib le  to 
decide the part of speech of a word 
based on the knowledge of such patterns 
in computer process ing of Japanese sen- 
tences. 
In Fig.10, 'K' in the column of 
pattern represents  a KANJI, 'H' repre- 
sents a HIRAGAN~, and 'I' represents  a 
KATAKANA. The left side of the bar chart 
shows the rate of total words. The right 
side of the bar chart  shows the rate of 
d i f ferent  words. 
Fig.10-(1) shows the pattern of 
common nouns. The left side of the bar 
chart  shows that KK-pattern  accounts for 
68.0% of total common nouns in the news- 
papers. The right side of the bar chart  
shows that KK-pattern accounts for 68.5% 
of d i f ferent  common nouns in the news- 
papers. 
Fig.10-(2) shows the pat tern  of 
proper nouns. Most of the proper nouns 
also have KANJI str ings. The rest of 
proper nouns have KATAKANA str ings ex- 
pressing foreign words. 
Fig.10-(3) shows the pattern of 
verbal  nouns which change to verbs with 
succeeding characters  ' ~ '  (se), ' 8' (sa) 
' b ' (sh i ) ,  ' ~ '  (su), ' ~ '(suru), ' ~ ' 
(sure), '~ ' ( seyo) .  The verbal  nouns 
consist  of KK-pattern up to 97.1% of 
total. If KK-pattern and succeeding 
characters  ' ~ '(se),' ~ '(sa), ' L '(shi ) 
...are found, such a character  string 
can be treated as a form of this kind. 
Fig.10-(4) shows the pattern of 
verbs. The verb of H-pattern is often 
used with preceding verbal  nouns. Most 
d i f ferent  verbs have KH-pattern.  
Fig.10-(5) shows the pattern of 
adject ive.  Most of the adject ives are 
wr i t ten with KH-pattern  or KHH-pattern.  
Fig.10-(6) shows the pattern of 
adverbs. Most of the adverbs are wr i t ten 
with HHH-pattern  or HHHH-pattern.  Namely  
they are wr i t ten in HIRAGANA. 
7. Relat ion between each character  
and part of speech 
We have assumed patterns of charac-  
ter str ings and the patterns are basi-  
cal ly  avai lable for c lass i f ing part of 
speech in actual  data. However,  the pat- 
terns do not provide suf f ic ient  cr i ter ia  
for the c lass i f icat ion.  For example, the

Fig. ii KANJI for verbs 
same pattern was found among dif-  
ferent parts  of speech. In order 
to obtain more accurate results, 
we analyzed re lat ions between each 
character  and each part of speech 
in the data of newspaper (restric- 
tion : word - f requency  ~ 3). 
In F ig. l l  the axis Y repre- 
sents total number of the last 
KANJI in a word. 
e.g. KKHH 
T .last KANJI in a word 
The axis X shows the rate of KANJI  
used for verbs. KANJI  on X=I00 are 
used for verbs in the all occur-  
rence of the last KANJI in a word. 
The re l iab i l i ty  of axis X increas- 
es according to the value of axis 
Y. In the lower area of the graph, 
the value on axis X seems to be 
d iscrete because of shortness of 
the data.
