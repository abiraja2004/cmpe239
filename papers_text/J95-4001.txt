Inference

During a conversation, agents can easily come to have different beliefs about the meaning or 
discourse role of some utterance. Participants normally rely on their expectations todetermine 
whether the conversation is proceeding smoothly: if nothing unusual is detected, then under- 
standing is presumed to occur. Conversely, when an agent says something that is inconsistent 
with another's expectations, then the other agent may change her interpretation ofan earlier turn 
and direct her response to the reinterpretation, accomplishing what is known as a fourth-turn 
repair. 
Here we describe an abductive account of the interpretation of speech acts and the repair of 
speech act misunderstandings. Our discussion considers the kinds o fin formation that participants 
use to interpret an utterance, even if it is inconsistent with their beliefs. It also considers the 
information used to design repairs. We describe a mapping between the utterance-level forms 
(semantics) and discourse-level acts (pragmatics), and a relation between the discourse acts and 
the beliefs and intentions that they express. We specify for each discourse act, the acts that might 
be expected, if the hearer has understood the speaker correctly. We also describe our account of 
belief and intention, distinguishing the beliefs agents actually have from the ones they act as if 
they have when they perform adiscourse act. To support repair, we model how misunderstandings 
can lead to unexpected actions and utterances and describe the processes of interpretation and 
repair. To illustrate the approach, we show how it accounts for an example repair. 
1. Introduction 
Speech act misunderstandings occur when two participants differ in their understand- 
ing of the discourse role of some utterance. For example, one speaker might take an 
utterance as an assertion while another understands it to be a request. Although many 
researchers have considered the problem of avoiding misunderstanding (e.g., by cor- 
recting misconceptions), previously none has addressed the problem of identifying 
and repairing misunderstandings once they occurred. Here, we will consider a gen- 
eral model of dialogue that also accounts for the detection and repair of speech act 
misunderstandings. 
1.1 The difference between misunderstanding and misconception 
The notions of misunderstanding and misconception are easily confounded, so we 
shall begin by explicating the distinction. Misconceptions are errors in the prior knowl- 
edge of a participant; for example, believing that Canada is one of the United States.

McCoy (1989), Calistri-Yeh (1991), Pollack (1986b), Pollack (1990), and others have stud- 
ied the problem of how one participant can determine the misconceptions of another 
during a conversation (see Section 5.3 below). Typically such errors can be recognized 
immediately when an expression is not interpretable with respect o the computer's 
(presumedly perfect!) knowledge of the world. 
By contrast, a participant is not aware, at least initially, when misunderstanding has 
occurred. In misunderstanding, a participant obtains an interpretation that she believes 
is complete and correct, but which is, however, not the one that the other participant 
intended her to obtain. At the point of misunderstanding, the interpretations of the 
two participants begin to diverge. It is possible that a misunderstanding will remain 
unnoticed in a conversation and the participants continue to talk at cross-purposes. 
Alternatively, the conversation might break down, leading one participant or the other 
to decide that a misunderstanding has occurred and (possibly) attempt to resolve it. 
1.2 The use of repair in the negotiation of meaning 
Although they might not always recognize a misunderstanding when it occurs, dis- 
course participants are aware that misunderstandings canoccur. So, participants, rather 
than just passively hoping that they have understood and have been understood, ac- 
tively listen for trouble and let each other know whether things seem okay. Each 
participant will use the subsequent discourse itself in order to judge whether previous 
discourse has been understood correctly. When one participant produces a response 
that is consistent and coherent with what the other has just said, then the other will 
take it as a display of understanding. Otherwise, it might be taken as evidence of 
misunderstanding. In either case, the response is used as an indication of how the 
second participant interpreted the first, as presumably his response must have some 
rational explanation; the indicated interpretation is called the displayed interpretation. 
When a participant notices a discrepancy between her own interpretation a d the one 
displayed by the other participant, she can choose to initiate a repair or to let it pass. 
By their choice of repairing or accepting a displayed interpretation, speakers in effect 
negotiate the meaning of utterances. 1 
Repairs can take many forms, depending on how and when a misunderstand- 
ing becomes apparent. Conversation analysts classify repairs according to how soon 
after the problematic turn a participant initiates a repair (Schegloff 1992). The most 
common type occurs within the turn itself or immediately after it, before the other 
participant has had a chance to reply. These are called first-turn repairs. The next most 
common type, second-turn repairs, occur as the reply to the problematic turn (e.g., 
as a request for clarification). We will not consider these two types of repairs further, 
because they do not involve misunderstanding perse. Rather, they are used to correct 
misconceptions, misspeakings, nonhearings, etc. 
Third-turn and fourth-turn 2 repairs address actual misunderstandings. If a display 
of misunderstanding occurs in the turn immediately following the one that was mis- 
understood, and the speaker notices the problem immediately and acts to resolve it, 
then we say that they have made a third-turn repair (see Example 1). 
1 Note that this choice allows for a speaker feigning the occurrence of a misunderstanding  order to 
achieve some social goal. 
2 Schegloff (1992) distinguishes nth-turn repair from nth-position repair. The former corresponds to
repairs that begin exactly n - 1 turns after the problematic utterance, while the latter allows an 
arbitrary number of intervening pairs of turns. We shall use "nth-turn" to refer to both types, allowing 
intervening exchanges.

Example 1 
T1 S: Where do you do this? 
T2 H: To make the crops grow. 
T3 S: I said where do you do it. 
T4 H: In a tin hut in Greeba. 
If a display of misunderstanding occurs during a subsequent turn by the same speaker 
who generated the misunderstood turn, and the hearer then reinterprets he earlier 
turn and produces a new response to it, then we say that they have made a fourth-turn 
repair. The fragment of conversation shown in Example 2 (Terasaki 1976) includes a 
fourth-turn repair. Initially, Russ interprets T1 as expressing Mother's desire to tell, that 
is, as a pretelling or preannouncement, butfinds this interpretation inconsistent with her 
next utterance. In T3, instead of telling him who's going (as one would expect after 
a pretelling), Mother claims that she does not know (and therefore could not tell). 
Russ recovers by reinterpreting T1 as an indirect request, which his T4 attempts to 
satisfy. Fox (1987) points out that such repairs involve, in effect, a reconstruction f the 
initial utterance. From an AI perspective, these reconstructions resemble the operation 
of a truth-maintenance system upon an abductive assumption that has proved to be 
incorrect. 3 
Example 2 
T1 Mother: Do you know who's going to that meeting? 
T2 Russ: Who? 
T3 Mother: I don't know. 
T4 Russ: Oh. Probably Mrs. McOwen and probably Mrs. Cadry and some 
of the teachers. 
1.3 The need for both intentional and social information 
The problem of interpreting an utterance involves deciding what actions the speaker is 
doing or trying to do. This process involves not only looking at the surface form of an 
utterance--for example, was it stated as a declarative?--but also at the context in which 
it was uttered. This context includes the tasks that the participants are involved in, 
the prior beliefs that they had, and the discourse itself. Context is important because 
it allows speakers to use the same set of words, for example, "Do you know what 
time it is?", to request he time, to express a complaint, or to ask a yes-no question. 
Intentional information can rule out some of these readings; for example, a belief that 
the speaker already knows the time might rule out the 'request' interpretation. 
The difficulty in considering misunderstandings in addition to intended interpre- 
tations is that it greatly increases the number of alternatives that an interpreter needs 
to consider, because one cannot simply ignore the interpretations that seem inconsis- 
tent. However, predominant computational pproaches to dialogue, which are based 
solely on inference of intention, already have difficulty constraining the interpretation 
process. Sociological accounts uggest a more constrained approach to interpretation 
3 This is distinct from the kind of plan repair described by Spencer (1990), which he models using an 
assumption-based truth-maintenance system. In his work, "repair" addresses the problem of 
incompleteness in a taxonomy of plans, rather than errors in interpretation. 
437 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
and the recognition of misunderstanding, but none are computational. Our model 
extends the intentional and social accounts of discourse, combining the strengths of 
both. 
In the intentional accounts, speakers use their beliefs, goals, and expectations to
decide what to say; when they interpret an utterance, they identify goals that might 
account for it. For example, a speaker who wants someone to know that she lacks a 
pencil might say "I don't have a pencil." A hearer might then interpret this utterance 
as an attempt to convey the information. However, for any goal that would explain an 
utterance, the reasons for having that goal would also be potential interpretations of 
the utterance. Thus, for the above utterance, intentional ccounts might also consider 
interpretations corresponding to an attempt to express a need for a pencil, a request 
to be given the pencil, an incomplete attempt to fill out a questionnaire, and so on. 4 
The inherent difficulty with this approach is thus knowing when to stop searching for 
potential meanings. 
According to the ethnomethodological account of human communication k own 
as Conversation Analysis (CA), agents design their behavior with the understanding 
that they will be held accountable for it. Agents know that their utterances will be taken 
to display their understanding of some (culturally determined) rules of conversation 
and the situation prior to the utterance. Agents, aware of some rule or norm that is 
relevant to their current situation, choose to follow (or not follow) the rule, depending 
on how they view the consequences of their choice. One important convention is the 
adjacency pair. Adjacency pairs are sequentially constrained pairs of utterances, (such 
as question-answer), in which an utterance of the first type creates an expectation for 
one of the second. A hearer is not bound to produce the expected reply, but if he 
does not, he must be ready to justify his action and to accept responsibility for any 
inferences that the speaker might make (Schegloff and Sacks 1973). Where the CA 
approach is weakest is in its explanation of how the recipient of an utterance is able 
to understand an utterance that is the first part of an adjacency pair. For this, an agent 
needs linguistic knowledge linking the features of an utterance to a range of speech 
acts that can form adjacency pairs. Agents also need to have some idea of the beliefs 
and intentions that particular actions express, so they can make judgments about heir 
appropriateness in the context. 
1.4 Overview 
The aim of our research is to construct a model of communicative interaction that will 
be able to support he negotiation of meaning. In particular, we want to develop a 
general model of conversation that is flexible enough to handle misunderstandings. 
To support his degree of flexibility, the agents that we model form expectations on 
the basis of what they hear, monitor for differences in understanding, and, when 
appropriate, change their own interpretations in response to new information. The 
model specifies the relationship between this reasoning and discourse participants' 
beliefs, intentions, and previously expressed attitudes, as well as their knowledge of 
social conventions. 
In the account, speakers elect speech acts on the basis of both their goals and 
their knowledge of which speech acts are expected to follow upon a given speech 
act. They must select an utterance form that both parties would agree (in the current 
4 The amount  of reasoning is a function of the size of one's plan hierarchy. So, if it is believed that 
questionnaires are used to obtain a dr iver 's license, which is needed to drive a car, which is needed to 
get to California, then this same utterance could even be interpreted as an incomplete attempt o get to 
California. Thus, the hearer must  also assume that he and the speaker share the same plan hierarchy.

discourse context) could accomplish the desired goal. Interpretation and repair attempt 
to apply this process in reverse, working back from an observed utterance to the 
underlying oal. Such reasoning is clearly nonmonotonic; here we suggest that it can be 
characterized quite naturally as abduction. The model is expressed as a logical theory 
in the Prioritized Theorist framework (Poole, Goebel, and Aleliunas 1987; van Arragon 
1990). 
2. The structured intentional approach 
We now introduce a model of dialogue that extends both intentional and social ac- 
counts of discourse. The model unifies theories of speech act production, interpretation, 
and the repair of misunderstandings. This unification is achieved by treating produc- 
tion as default reasoning, while using abduction to model interpretation and repair. In 
addition, the model avoids open-ended inference about goals by using expectations 
derived from social norms to guide interpretation. As a result, the model provides a 
constrained, yet principled, account of interpretation; it also links social accounts of 
expectation with other mental states. 
In this section, we will discuss how the model addresses the following concerns: 
? The need to control the inference from observed actions to expected 
replies. Extended inference about goals is usually unnecessary and a 
waste of resources. 
? The need to account for nonmonotonicity in both the interpretation and 
production of utterances. This nonmonotonicity akes two forms. First, 
utterances can make only a part of the speaker's goals explicit to the 
hearer, so hearers must reason abductively to account for them. Second, 
expectations are defeasible. At any given moment, speakers may differ in 
their beliefs about the dialogue and hence can only assume that they 
understand each other. Speakers manage the nonmonotonicity b  
negotiating with each other to achieve understanding. 
? The need to detect and correct misunderstandings. Speakers rely on their 
expectations to decide whether they have understood each other. When 
hearers identify an apparent inconsistency, they can reinterpret an earlier 
utterance and respond to it anew. However, if they fail to identify a 
misunderstanding, the communication might mislead them into 
prematurely believing that their goals have been achieved. 
? The need for an alternative to the notion of mutual belief. Typically, 
models rely on mutual beliefs without accounting for how speakers 
achieve them or for why speakers hould believe that they have 
achieved them. 
2.1 Using social conventions to guide interpretation and repair 
Our account of interpretation avoids the extended inference required by plan-based 
models by reversing the standard dependency between an agent's expectations and 
task-related goals. Plan-based approaches (Allen and Perrault 1979; Litman 1986; Car- 
berry 1990; Lambert and Carberry 1991) start by applying context-independent infer- 
ence rules to identify the agent's task-related plan, possibly favoring alternatives that 
extend a previously recognized plan. By contrast, our approach begins with an expec- 
tation, using it to premise both the analysis of utterance meaning and any inference 
439 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
about an agent's goals. Moreover, our approach treats apparent conflicts with expec- 
tations as meaningful; for example, if an utterance is inconsistent with expectations, 
then the reasoner will try to explain the inconsistency. 
The model focuses on two convention-based sources of expectation. The first 
is conventions about what attitudes (belief, desire, intention, etc) each speech act 
expresses; s we call these the linguistic intentions of the speech act. The second is con- 
ventions for each speech act about what act should follow; we call these linguistic 
expectations. Speakers will expect each other to display their understanding of these 
conventions and how they apply to their conversation. Thus, they can expect each 
other to be consistent in the attitudes that they express and to respond to each act 
with its conventional reply, unless they have (and can provide) a valid reason not to. 
Linguistic intentions are based on Grice's (1957) notion of reflexive intention. For 
example, an inform(S,H,P) expresses the linguistic intentions whose content is P and 
intend(S,know(H,P)) (i.e., the speaker intends the hearer to believe (1) that P is true and 
(2) that the speaker intends that the hearer know P). Linguistic expectations capture 
the notion of adjacency pairs. 6 
In defining linguistic intentions, which are shown in Figure 1, we have followed 
existing speech act taxonomies, especially those given by Bach and Harnish (1979), 
Allen (1983), and Hinkelman (1990). 7Thus, when a speaker produces an askref about 
P she expresses (and thereby intends the hearer to recognize that she expresses) that 
she does not know the referent of some description i  P, intends to find out the referent 
of that description, and intends the hearer to tell her that referent. If the speaker is 
sincere, she actually believes the content of what she expresses; if the hearer is trusting, 
he might come to believe that she believes it. 
Following Schegloff's (1988) analysis of Example 2, we provide a speech act def- 
inition for pretell. 8 In order to capture the linguistic intentions of pretelling, we also 
add a new attitude, knowsBetterRef(S, H, P) that is true if the knowledge of S is strictly 
better than the knowledge of P--for example, because S is the expert or S has had 
more recent experience with P. 
We allow that individuals might not all share the same taxonomy of speech acts 
and linguistic intentions and that certain social groups or activities might have their 
own specialized sets of linguistic expectations. 9 Our theory supports this flexibility by 
having each speaker evaluate the coherence of all utterances within her own view of 
the discourse. Thus, where we refer to the "displayed interpretation" of an utterance, 
we mean displayed given the perspective of a particular speaker. 1?
5 We assume that these attitudes are a function of discourse or illocutionary level of speech acts, rather 
than the surface or locutionary level. This approach as worked well for us, but, as one reviewer 
remarked, it is an interesting issue as to whether they are also a function of the locutionary level. 
6 Note that although linguistic intentions often express that an action is intended (e.g., questions express 
an intention that the hearer answer), the two conventions are independent. For example, while an 
invitation to visit at 6pm might create an expectation that dinner will be served, it does not express an 
intention to serve it. 
7 In the figure, we have used the symbol intend to name both the intention to achieve a situation in 
which a property holds and the intention to do action. 
8 Schegloff actually argues against representing such sequences as speech acts; however, as in the 
computational work cited above, we have used the notion of "discourse-level speech act" to represent 
the functional relationship between the surface form of an utterance, the context, and the attitudes 
expressed by the speaker. 
9 Reithinger and Maier (1995) have used n-gram dialogue act probabilities to induce the adjacency pairs 
from a corpus of dialogues for appointment scheduling. 
10 Communication can occur despite such differences because speakers with similar linguistic experiences 
presumably will develop similar expectations about how discourse works. Differences in expectations 
might very well be one thing that new acquaintances must resolve in order to avoid social conflict.

The figure shows a list of attitudes that each act expresses; the lists are assumed 
to be exhaustive with respect o the theory (but not to the various connotations that 
might be associated with each act). The set of acts itself is not necessarily exhaustive, 
but sufficient o handle the examples that we consider. While our taxonomy might 
seem small, most other acts appear to be specializations of those that we selected. 
Similarly, the model incorporates only a small number of linguistic expectations; these 
are shown in Figure 2.11 
2.2 Characterizing interpretation, production, and repair 
Our model unifies the fundamental tasks of interpreting speech acts, producing speech 
acts, and repairing speech act interpretations within a nonmonotonic framework. In 
particular, speakers' knowledge about language is represented asa set of default rules. 
The rules describe conventional strategies for producing coherent utterances, thereby 
displaying understanding, and strategies for identifying misunderstanding. As a re- 
suit, speakers' decisions about what utterances they might coherently generate next 
correspond to default inference over this theory, while decisions about possible in-

adjacency pairs. In addition, we have used pairs discovered byConversation A alysis from real

terpretations of utterances fincluding recognizing misunderstanding) correspond to 
abductive inference over the theory. 
Definition 1 
Given a theory T and a goal proposition G, we say that one can abduce a set of 
assumptions A from ~ if T U A ~ G and T U A is consistent. 
Abduction has been applied to the solution of local pragmatics problems (Hobbs et al 
1988, 1993) and to story understanding (Charniak and Goldman 1988). 
The model incorporates five strategies, or metaplans, for generating coherent utter- 
ances: plan adoption, acceptance, challenge, repair, and closing (the model treats opening 
as a kind of plan adoption). Figure 3 contains a conversation that includes an example 
for each of the five types. In plan adoption, speakers simply choose an action that can be 
expected to achieve a desired illocutionary goal, given social norms and the discourse 
context. (The goal itself must originate within the speaker's non-linguistic planning 
mechanism.) The first utterance in the figure is a plan adoption. The second utterance 
in the figure, if it occurs immediately after an utterance such as the first one, would 
be an acceptance. With acceptance of an utterance, agents perform actions that have 
been elicited by a discourse partner. That is, the hearer displays his understanding and 
acceptance of the appropriateness of a speaker's utterance (independent of whether he 
actually agrees with it). Challenges display understanding of an utterance, while deny- 
ing its appropriateness. For example, an agent might challenge the presuppositions of 
a previous action. The third utterance, if it occurs immediately after an utterance such 
as the first one, would be a challenge. Repairs display non-acceptance of a previously 
displayed interpretation (see Section 1.2). The fourth utterance, occurring after an ex- 
change such as/1, 3/, would be a third-turn repair by A; the fifth utterance, occurring 
442 
McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
after (1, 3, 4), would be a fourth-turn repair by BJ 2 Closings signal that the participants 
are ready to terminate the conversation (and that they accept he conversation as a 
whole). The last utterance in the figure is a closing. 
Misunderstandings are classified according to which participant recognizes that 
the misunderstanding has occurred and whom she thinks has misunderstood. Self- 
misunderstandings are those in which a hearer finds that a speaker's current utterance 
is inconsistent with something that that speaker said earlier and decides that his own 
interpretation of the earlier utterance must be incorrect. Conversely, other-misunder- 
standings are those in which the hearer attributes a misunderstanding to the speaker. 
Fourth-turn repairs may occur after a self-misunderstanding is recognized; third-turn 
repairs may occur after other-misunderstanding. 
The model addresses both classes of misunderstanding (see Section 3.3.3), but is 
limited to misunderstandings that appear as misrecognized speech acts) 3 Such misun- 
derstandings are especially important to detect, because the discourse role attributed 
to an utterance creates expectations that influence the interpretation of subsequent 
ones. These misunderstandings arealso difficult to prevent, because they can result 
from many common sources, including intra-sentential ambiguity and mishearing. 
2.3 Building a model of the interpreted discourse 
For a hearer to interpret an utterance as a particular metaplan or as a manifestation 
of misunderstanding, he needs a model of his understanding of.the prior discourse. 
The typical way to model interpretations has been to represent the discourse as a 
partially completed plan corresponding to the actual beliefs (perhaps even mutual 
beliefs) of the participants (cf. Carberry 1990). This representation incorporates two 
assumptions that must be relaxed in any model that accounts for the negotiation 
of meaning: first, that hearers are always credulous about what the speaker says, 
and second, that neither participant makes mistakes. To relax these assumptions, the 
hearer's model distinguishes the beliefs that speakers claim or act as if they have 
during the dialogue from those that the hearer actually believes they have. TM The 
model also represents he alternative interpretations that the hearer has considered as 
a result of repair. 15 We will now consider an axiomatization f the model. 
3. The architecture of the model 
Our model characterizes a participant in a dialogue, alternately acting as speaker and 
hearer. In this section, we will give both the knowledge structures that enable the 
participant's behavior and the reasoning algorithms that produce it. (Section 4 and 
Appendix A present machine-to-machine dialogues involving two instantiations of
the implemented model.) 
3.1 The reasoning framework: Prioritized Theorist 
The model has been formulated using the Prioritized Theorist framework (Poole, 
Goebel, and Aleliunas 1987; Brewka 1989; van Arragon 1990), because it supports 
both default and abductive reasoning. Theorist ypifies what is known as a "proof- 
12 Non-understanding, which entails non-acceptance (ordeferred acceptance), is signaled by second-turn 
repair. This type of repair will not be considered here. 
13 Other misunderstandings arepossible; for example there can be disagreement about what object a 
speaker is trying to identify with a referring expression (cf. Heeman and Hirst 1995; Hirst et al 1994). 
14 This distinction is similar to the one made by Luperfoy (1992). 
15 For present purposes, we also assume that the complete model is accessible to the hearer; one could 
better simulate the limitations of working memory by limiting access to only the most recent utterances. 
443 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
based approach" to abduction because it relies on a theorem prover to collect the 
assumptions that would be needed to prove a given set of observations and to verify 
their consistency. Our reasoning algorithm is based on Poole's implementat ion of The- 
orist, which we extended to incorporate preferences among defaults as suggested by 
van Arragon (1990). 16 A Prioritized Theorist reasoner can assume any default d that 
the programmer  has designated as a potential hypothesis, unless it can prove -~d from 
some overriding fact or hypothesis. This makes the reasoning nonmonotonic,  because 
the addition of a new fact or overriding default may make less preferable hypotheses 
underivable. 
The syntax of Theorist is an extension of the predicate calculus. It distinguishes 
two types of formulae, facts and defaults. In Poole's implementation, facts are given 
by "FACT W.", where w is a wff. A default can be given either by "DEFAULT (p, d)." or 
"DEFAULT (p, d) : w.", where p is a priority value, d is an atomic formula with only 
free variables as arguments, and w is a wff. For example, we can express the default 
that birds normal ly fly, as: 
DEFAULT (2, birdsFly(b) : bird(b) D fly(b). 
If 9 t" is the set of facts and AP is the set of defaults with priority p, then an expres- 
sion DEFAULT(p,d) : W asserts that d E AP and (d D w) E 5 r. The language lacks 
explicit quantification; as in Prolog, variable names are understood to be universally 
quantified. 
Facts are taken as true in the domain, whereas defaults correspond to the hy- 
potheses of the domain (i.e., formulae that can be assumed true when the facts alone 
are insufficient o explain some observation). A priority value is an integer associated 
with a given default (and all ground instances of it), where a default with priority i is 
stronger than one with priority j, if i < j. When two defaults conflict, the stronger one 
(i.e., the one having the lower priority value) takes precedence. For sets of defaults A i

In the Theorist framework,  explanation is a process akin to scientific theory forma- 
t ion - i f  a closed formula representing an observation is a logical consequence of the 
facts and a consistent set of default assumptions, then it can be explained:

16 Poole's Theorist implements a full first-order clausal theorem prover in Prolog. Like Prolog, it applies a 
resolution-based procedure, reducing oals to their subgoals using rules of the form 
goa l  *--- subgoa l l  A ? ? ? A subgoa ln .  However, unlike Prolog, it incorporates a model-elimination strategy 
(Loveland 1978; Stickel 1989; Umrigar and Pitchumani 1985) to reason by cases.

Priority constraints require that no ground instance of d E Ai can be in D i if its negation 
is explainable with defaults usable from any A J, j < i. 
Priorities enable one to specify that one default is stronger than another, perhaps 
because it represents an exception. In our model, defaults will have one of three 
priority values: strong, weak, or very weak. The strongest value is reserved for attitudes 
about the prior context, whereas assumptions about expectations are given as weak 
defaults and assumptions about unexpected actions or interpretations are given as 
very weak defaults. This allows us to specify a preference for expected analyses when 
there is an ambiguity. 
3.2 The language of our model 
The model is based on a sorted first-order language, where every term is either an 
agent, a turn, a sequence of turns, an action, a description, or a supposition. The 
language includes an infinite number of variables and function symbols of every sort 
and arity. We also define several special ones to characterize suppositions, actions, and 
sequences of turns. 
3.2.1 Suppositions. Suppositions are terms that name propositions that agents believe 
or express. Suppositions can be thought of as quoted propositions, but with a limited 
syntax and semantics. We define the following functional expressions: 
? do(s,a) expresses that agent s has performed the action a; 
? mistake(s, al,a2) expresses that agent s has mistaken an act al for act a2; 
? and(pl,p2) expresses the conjunction of suppositions Pl and P2, where Pl 
must be simple (i.e., not formed from others using the function symbol 
and); 
? not p expresses the negation of a simple supposition p.17 
We also define several suppositions for expressions of knowledge and intention. 
Two suppositions are equivalent if and only if they are syntactically identical. To 
capture the notion that speakers are normally consistent in the suppositions that they 
choose to express, we need to know how different suppositions relate to each other. 
More to the point, we need to know when the expressing of two simple suppositions 
is or is not consistent. A complete account must take into consideration possible en- 
tailments among expressed propositions; however, no such account yet exists. As a 
placeholder for such a theory, there is a compatibility relation for expressed supposi- 
tions. Our approach is to make compatibility a default and define axioms to exclude 
clearly incompatible cases, such as these: 
? The suppositions Q and not Q. 
? The supposition of an intention to make Q true when Q is already true 
in the agent's interpretation f the discourse. 
17 The function not is distinct from the boolean connective 7. We use it to capture the supposition 
expressed by an agent who says something negative, e.g., "I do not want to go," which might be 
represented as inform(s, h, not wantToGo}. 
445 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
The supposition of the performance of some act that expresses, via a 
linguistic intention, any supposition that would be incompatible with 
(another supposition of) the agent's interpretation of the discourse. 
The supposition of an intention to perform some act expressing any 
supposition that is incompatible with the agent's interpretation of the 
discourse. 
The supposition of an intention to knowif Q if either Q or not Q is 
already true in the agent's interpretation of the discourse. 
When suppositions are not simple, we check their compatibility by verifying that each 
of the conjuncts of each supposition is compatible. (In the system, this is implemented 
as a special predicate, inconsistentLI). 
There is a danger in treating compatibility as a default in that one might miss 
some intuitively incompatible cases and hence some misunderstandings might not be 
detectable. An alternative would be to base compatibility on the notion of consistency 
in the underlying logic, if a complete logic has been defined. TM
3.2.2 Speech acts. For simplicity, we represent utterances as surface-level speech acts 
in the manner first used by Perrault and Allen (1980). 19 Following Cohen and Levesque 
(1985), we limit the surface language to the acts surface-request, surface-inform, 
surface-informref, and surface-informif. Example 3 shows the representation f the 
literal form of Example 2, the fourth-turn repair example. (We abbreviate "m" for 
"Mother", "r" for "Russ", and "whoIsGoing" for "who's going".) 
Example 3 
T1 m: surface-request(m, r, informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))) 
T2 r: surface-request(r, m, informref(m, r, whoIsGoing)) 
T3 m: surface-inform(m, r not knowref(m, whoIsGoing)) 
T4 r: surface-informref(r, m, whoIsGoing) 
We assume that such forms can be identified by the parser, for example treating all 
declarative sentences as surface-informs. 2?
18 Note that human behavior lies somewhere in between these two extremes; in particular, people do not 
seem to express all the entailments of what they utter (Walker 1991). 
19 Other representation la guages, uch as one based on case semantics, would also be compatible with 
the approach and would permit greater flexibility. The cost of the increased flexibility would be 
increased ifficulty in mapping surface descriptions onto speech acts; however, because less effort 
would be required in sentence processing, the total complexity of the problem need not increase. Using 
a more finely-grained representation, e could reason about sentence type, particles, and prosody 
explicitly, instead of requiring the sentence processor to interpret this information (cf. Hinkelman 1990; 
Beun 1990). 
20 We also presume that a parser can recognize surface-informref and surface-informif syntactically 
when the input is a sentence fragment, but it would not hurt our analysis to input them all as 
surface-inform. 
446 
McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
The theory includes the discourse-level acts inform, informif, informref, assert, 
assertif, assertref, askref, askif, request, preteU, testref, and warn, which we represent 
using a similar notation. 2~,22 
3.2.3 Turn sequences. A turn sequence represents the interpretations of the discourse 
that a participant has considered up to a particular time. It is structured as a tree, where 
each level below the root corresponds to a single turn in the sequence, ordered as they 
occurred in time. Each path from the root to a leaf represents a single interpretation 
of the dialogue. Nodes that are siblings (i.e., that have the same parent) correspond to 
different interpretations of the same turn. Nodes at the same level, but having different 
parents, represent repairs. The currently active interpretation is defined by its most 
recent urn, which we shall call the focus of the sequence. 
The purpose of this tree structure is to capture the sequential structure of the 
dialogue and, for each state of the dialogue, what attitudes the participants are ac- 
countable for having expressed. 23Branches in the sequential structure nable the par- 
ticipants to retract attitudes via repair and to reason about the alternatives that they 
have achieved. 
We will call the turn sequence whose focus is the current turn the "discourse 
context". In order to consider previous tates of the context, such as before a possible 
misunderstanding occurred, we define a successor relation on turn sequences: 
Definition 3 
A turn sequence TS2 is a successor to turn sequence TS1 if TS2 is identical to TS1 
except hat TS2 has an additional turn t that is not a turn of TS1 and t is the successor 
to the focused turn of TS1. 
3.3 The characterization of a discourse participant 
We will now consider the knowledge structures that enable a participant's behavior 
and the reasoning algorithms that produce it. We divide our specification of a partic- 
ipant into three subtheories: 
A set/3 of prior assumptions about the beliefs and goals expressed by 
the speakers (including assumptions about misunderstanding). 
A set A/I of potential assumptions about misunderstandings and 
metaplanning decisions. 
A theory T describing his or her linguistic knowledge, including 
principles of interaction and facts relating linguistic acts. 
Given these three subtheories, an interpretation of an utterance is a set of ground 
instances of assumptions that explain the utterance. An utterance would be a coherent 
21 In the utterance language, a yes-no question is taken to be a surface-request to informif and a 
wh-question is taken to be a surface-request to informref. We then translate these request forms into 
the discourse-level actions askif and askref. An alternative would be to identify them as surface-askif 
or surface-askref during sentence processing, asHinkelman (1990) does. 
22 Speech act names that end with the suffix -ref take a description as an argument; speech act names that 
end with -if take a supposition. The act inform(s,p) asserts that he proposition is true. The act 
informif(s, p) asserts the truth value of the proposition named by p (i.e., informif is equivalent to
"inform V inform-not"). 
23 Tree structures are often used to represent discourse, but usually the hierarchical structure of the 
discourse, rather than its temporal structure (see Lambert and Carberry 1991, 1992). 
447 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
reply to an immediately preceding utterance if it would logically follow, given the 
selection of some metaplan: 
Defini t ion 4 
An interpretation of an utterance u to hearer h by speaker s in discourse context s is 
a set M of instances of elements of A4, such that 
. 
2. 
3. 
T U 13 U M is consistent 
T U 13 U M ~ utter(s, h, u, ts) 
T U 13 U M satisfies the priority constraints; that is, T U 13 U M is not in 
conflict with any stronger defaults that might apply. 
Defini t ion 5 
It would be coherent for s to utter u in discourse context s if the utterance can be de- 
rived from an agent's linguistic knowledge, assuming some set M meta of metaplanning 
decisions, such that 
. 
2. 
3. 
'-d-" U \]3 S M meta is cons is tent  
T Y 13 U M meta ~ utter(s, h, u, ts) 
"~ U \]3 U M meta satisfies the priority const ra in ts .  
That is, u is a solution to the following default reasoning problem: 
T U 13 U M meta ~- (3u) utter(s, h, u, ts) 
In the language of the model, the predicate shouldTry is used for discourse ac- 
tions that are coherent (M meta) and the predicate try is for actions that are explainable 
(M). If shouldTry(S1,S2,A,TS) is true, it means that, given discourse context TS (which 
corresponds to a particular agent's perspective), it would be appropriate for speaker 
$1 to address speaker $2 with discourse-level speech act A (i.e., according to social 
conventions, here represented by the linguistic expectations and the meta-plans, S1 
should do A next). 
By contrast, try(S1,S2,A,T2) would mean. that, given a discourse context TS, $1 has 
performed the discourse-level act A. Discourse-level acts are related to surface-level 
acts by the following default: 
DEFAULT (3, pickForm (sl, s2, asurfaceForm, a, ts)) :24 
decomp( asurfaceForm, a) 
A try(s1, s2, a, ts) 
D utter(s1, s2, asurfaceForm, ts). 
This says that the fact that the surface form asurfaceForm can be used to perform discourse 
act a in some context and the apparent occurrence of a would be a reason for agent sl 
to utter asurfaceForm? 
24 The model does not discriminate between equally acceptable alternatives. The default pickForm allows 
us to account for the fact that the same surface form can perform several discourse acts and the same 
discourse act might be accomplished by one of several different surface forms. In our system, this 
default is also used as an oracle, allowing us to see how different interpretations affect he participants' 
understanding of subsequent turns. Because the default has a very weak priority, it can be overridden 
by user input, without influencing other defaults.

Figure 4 
The relationship between try and shouldTry and their possible xplanations. 
The predicates shouldTry and try are related because the appropriateness of a po- 
tential interpretation is taken as (default) evidence that it is, in fact, the correct inter- 
pretation: 
DEFAULT (1, intentionalAct(sl,s2,a, ts)): 
shouldTry( s l, s2, a, ts ) 
D try(s1, $2, a, ts). 
The key difference is that try allows that the best interpretation might be contextually 
inappropriate (see Figure 4). 
Interpretation corresponds to the following problem in Theorist: 
EXPLAIN utter(sl, s2, u, ts). 
Generation corresponds to the following problem in Theorist: 
EXPLAIN shouldTry(sl, s2, aa, ts) A decomp(as, aa). 
In addition, acts of interpretation a d generation update the set of beliefs and goals 
assumed to be expressed uring the discourse. 25
3.3.1 The discourse context. The first component ofthe model, B, represents he beliefs 
and goals that the participants have expressed uring their conversation. We assume 
that an agent will maintain a record of these xpressed attitudes, represented asa turn 
sequence. To keep track of the current interpretation f the dialogue, we introduce the 
notion of activation of a supposition with respect o a turn sequence. If during a turn 
T, a supposition is expressed by an agent hrough the utterance of some speech act or 
the display of misunderstanding, then we say it becomes active in the turn sequence 
that has T as its focus (see Section 3.2.3). Moreover, once active, a supposition will 
remain active in all succeeding turn sequences, unless it is explicitly refuted. 
Individual ttrrns are represented by a set of facts of the form expressed(P,T) and 
expressedNot(P,T), where P is an unnegated supposition that has not been formed from 
any simpler suppositions using the function and. 26 
25 A related concern is how an agent's beliefs might change after an utterance has been understood as an 
act of a particular type. A l though we have nothing new to add here, Perrault (1990) shows how default 
logic might be used to address this problem. 
26 The intended meaning of expressedNot(P, T) is that dur ing turn T speakers have acted as if the

3.3.2 Possible hypotheses. The second component of the model is .M, the set of poten- 
tial assumptions about misunderstandings and metaplanning decisions. This is given 
by the following set of Theorist defaults: 27 
intentionalAct, expectedReply, acceptance, adoptPlan, challenge, makeFourth TurnRepair, make- 
ThirdTurnRepair, econstruction, otherMisunderstanding, selfMisunderstanding, and done. 
The theorem prover may assume ground instances of any of these predicates if they are 
consistent with all facts and with any defaults having higher priority. As mentioned 
in Section 3.1, each of these defaults will have one of threepriority values: strong, 
weak, or very weak. The strongest level is reserved for attitudes about beliefs and sup- 
positions. Assumptions about expectations (i.e., expectedReply, acceptance, makeThird- 
TurnRepair, and makeFourthTurnRepair) e given as weak defaults. Assumptions about 
unexpected actions or interpretations (i.e., adoptPlan, challenge, done, selfMisunderstand- 
ing, and otherMisunderstanding) are given as very weak defaults, so that axioms can be 
written to express a preference for expected analyses when there is an ambiguity. We 
will consider each of these predicates in greater detail in the next section, when we 
discuss the third component of the model. 
3.3.3 A speaker's theory of language. The third component of the model is T, a 
speaker's theory of communicative interaction. This theory includes strategies for ex- 
pressing beliefs and intentions, for displaying understanding, and for identifying when 
understanding has broken down. The strategies for displaying understanding suggest 
performing speech acts that have an identifiable, but defeasible, relationship to other 
speech acts in the discourse (or to the situation). Misunderstandings are recognized 
when an utterance is inconsistent or incoherent; strategies for repair suggest reanalyz- 
ing previous utterances or making the problem itself public. 
Relations on linguistic knowledge. There are three important linguistic knowledge rela- 
tions: decomp, lintention, and lexpectation. They are shown as circles in Figure 5; the 
boxes in the figure are the objects that they relate. 
supposition P were false. Although expressed(not(P), T) and expressedNot(P, T) represent the same state 
of affairs, the latter expression avoids infinite recursion by Theorist. 
27 The theory also contains defaults to capture the persistence of activation (persists), and the willingness 
of participants to assume that others have a particular belief or goal (credulousB and credulousI, 
respectively). 
450 
McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
The decomp relation links surface-level forms to the discourse-level forms that they 
might accomplish in different contexts. It corresponds to the body relation in STRIPS- 
based approaches. 2s Two speech acts are ambiguous whenever they can be performed 
with the same surface-level form. Lintentions relate discourse acts to the linguistic 
intentions that they conventionally express (see Section 2.1). The lexpectation relation 
captures the notion of linguistic expectation discussed in Section 2.1, relating each act 
to the acts that might be expected to follow. Where there is more than one expected 
act, a condition is used to distinguish them. For example, the axioms representing the 
linguistic expectations of askref are shown below. 29 
FACT lexpectation(do(sl, askref(sl, $2, d)), 
knowref(s2, d), 
do(s2, informref(s2, Sl, d))). 
"A speaker Sl can expect hat making an askref of d to s2 
will result in s2 telling Sl the referent of d, if s2 knows it." 
FACT lexpectation(dO(Sl, askref(sl, S2, d)), 
not knowref(s2, d), 
do(s2, inform(s2, Sl, not knowref(s2, d)))). 
"A speaker Sl can expect hat making an askref of d to s2 
will result in s2 telling sl that s2 does not know the referent of 
d, if s2 does not know it." 
Beliefs and goals. In the model, participants' actual beliefs and goals are distinguished 
from those that they express through their utterances. For the examples considered 
here, any model of belief would suffice; for simplicity we chose to include beliefs and 
goals explicitly in the initial background theory and allow agents to make assumptions 
about each other's beliefs and goals by default. B? 
Expectation. In addition to the notion of linguistic expectations, which exist in any 
situation, the model incorporates a cognitive, "belief-about-the-future" notion of ex- 
pectation. These expectations depend on a speaker's knowledge of social norms, her 
understanding of the discourse so far, and her beliefs about the world at a particular 
time. They are captured by the following Theorist rules: 
DEFAULT (2, expectedReply(pao, Pcondition, dO(Sl, areplv), ts) ) : 
active(pdo, ts ) 
/~ lexpectation (P ao, Pcondition, do(s1, areply ) ) 
/k believe( sl, Pcondition ) 
9 expected(s1, arepl~, ts). 
FACT -qintentionsOk(a, ts ) 
D -~expectedReply(pao, Pc ndition, do(s ,  a), ts). 
28 Pollack (1986a) calls this the "is-a-way-to" relation. 
29 It is actually controversial whether an askref followed by an inform-not-knowref  is a valid adjacency 
pair. If such questions are taken to presuppose that the hearer knows the answer, a response to the 
contrary could also be considered a challenge of this presupposit ion (Tsui 1991). 
30 It would have been possible to characterize actual belief us ing an appropriate set of axioms, such as 
those defining a weak $4 modal  logic. However, current formalizations do not seem to account for the 
context-sensitivity of speakers' beliefs. See McRoy (1993b) for a discussion. 
451 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
The second rule says that one would not expect he action areply if the linguistic in- 
tentions associated with it are incompatible with the context s. 31 Normally, as the 
discourse progresses, expectations for action that held in previous tates of the con- 
text eventually cease to hold in the current context, because after the action occurs, it 
would be incompatible for an agent o say that he intends to achieve something that is 
already true. The compatibility between each of the linguistic intentions of a proposed 
action and each of the active suppositions in a context is captured by the predicate 
lintentionsOk, which is true if and only if none of the incompatibilities described in 
Section 3.2.1 hold. 
For convenience, we also define a subjunctive form of expectation toreason about 
expectations that would arise as a result of future actions (e.g., plan adoption) or 
that must be considered when evaluating a potential repair. This type of expectation 
differs from the type defined above in that it depends on the real beliefs of the agent 
performing the first (rather than the second) part of an adjacency pair and it does not 
depend on the activity of any suppositions or actions. 
FACT lexpectation (do(s1,  al ), p, do(s2,  a2)) 
A believe(s1, p) 
=- wouldExpect(st, al, a2). 
Metaplans and misunderstandings. Metaplans encode strategies for selecting an appro- 
priate act. The antecedents of these axioms refer to expectations. In addition, in order 
to preserve discourse coherence, they require either that the linguistic intentions of 
suggested actions be compatible with the context or that there be some overt acknowl- 
edgement of the discrepancy. (The theory presented here addresses only the former 
case; the latter one might be handled by adding an extra default with a stronger 
priority level.) Tables 1-6 give each of these axioms in detail. 
Along with these metaplans, a speaker's linguistic theory includes two diagnos- 
tic axioms that characterize speech act misunderstandings: self-misunderstanding a d
other-misunderstanding. The antecedents of these axioms refer to ambiguities and 
inconsistencies with expressed linguistic intentions, as well as expectations. For exam- 
ple, Table 5 describes how an observed inconsistency of Sl performing anew might be 
a symptom of s2's misinterpretation of an earlier act by Sl. Such mistakes are possible 
when the surface form of the earlier act might be used to accomplish either aobserved or 
a intende d.32 
The defaults that characterize misunderstandings have a lower priority than the 
metaplans, because speakers consider misunderstandings only when no coherent inter- 
pretation ispossible. The preference for coherent interpretations is especially important 
when there is more than one discourse-level act for which the utterance is a possible 
decomposition. 
31 Although, like expectedReply, active is a default, active will take precedence over expectedReply, because it 
has been given a higher priority on the assumption that memory for suppositions i stronger than 
expectation. 
32 It is possible that the same surface form might accomplish several different discourse acts, in which 
case it might be desirable to evaluate the likelihood of alternative choices. The work discussed by 
Reithinger and Maier (1995), for example, found statistical regularities in the misinterpretations that 
occurred in their corpus of appointment-scheduling dialogues.

In the input we represent this dialogue as the following sequence: 
T1 m: surface-request(m, r  informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing)))  
T2 r: surface-request(r, m, informref(m, r, whoIsGoing))  
T3 m: surface-inform(m, r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing))  
T4 r: surface-informref(r, m, whoIsGoing)  
From Russ's perspective, these utterances had the following discourse-level interpre- 
tations at the time each was produced: 
T1 m: pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing)  
T2 r: askref(r, m, whoIsGoing)  
T3 m: inform(m, r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing))

After Russ hears T3, he decides that his interpretation of Mother 's  first turn as a 
pretelling is incorrect. This revision then leads him to reinterpret i as an askref and 
to provide a new response. 
We will now show how Russ's beliefs might progress this way. In particular, we 
shall address the following questions: 
? How Russ decides, after first concluding that T1 was a pretell ing, that 
he will respond with an askref. 
? How Russ decides, after hearing Mother 's  response T3, that his earlier 
decision was incorrect. 
? How Russ decides to produce an informref  in T4. 
Figures 6, 7, 9, and 10 will show the output of the system for each of the four turns 
of this dialogue, from Russ's perspective. 
4.2 Initial assumptions 
For this example, we shall assume that Russ believes that he knows who is going to 
the meeting (but also allows that Mother 's  knowledge about the meeting would be 
more accurate than his own). For simplicity, we represent these beliefs as facts. 33 
FACT believe(r, knowref(r, whoIsGoing)). 
FACT believe(r, knowsBetterRef(m,r, whoIsGoing)). 
33 We might have used priorities to express different degrees of belief.

4.3 Turn 1: Russ decides that Mother is pretelling 
According to the model, after Russ hears Mother's surface-request, "Do you know 
who is going to that meeting?", he interprets it by attempting toconstruct a plausible 
explanation of it. This requires tentatively choosing adiscourse-level act on the basis of 
the decomposition relation and then attempting toabduce ither that it is an intentional 
display of understanding or that it is a symptom of misunderstanding. Theorist is 
called to explain the utterance and returns with a list of assumptions that were made 
to complete the explanation. (The portion of the output from the update describes 
Russ's interpretation f this explanation; see Figure 6.) 
In this simulation, T1 was explained as an intentional pretelling. The explanation 
contains the metaplanning assumption that Mother was pretelling as part of a plan to 
get Russ to ask a question. The reasoner also attributed to her the linguistic intentions 
of pretelling. We will now consider the complete xplanation i detail. 
Inference begins with a call to Theorist o explain the input: 
utter(m, r, surface-request(m,r, informif(r,m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))),ts(0)) 
This utterance must be explained by finding a discourse-level speech act that it might 
accomplish and a metaplan or misunderstanding that would explain this act. This 
makes use of the following default: 
DEFAULT (3, pickForm(sl, s2, asurfaceForm, a, ts) ) : 
decomp ( asurfaceForm, a) 
A try(sl,s2,a, ts) 
9 utter(s1, s2, asurfaceFo~m, ts).
To satisfy the first premise, the reasoner would need to find a speech act that is related 
to the surface form by the decomp relation, for example, either an askif, an askref, or 
a pretelling: 
decomp(surface-request(m, r, informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))), 
pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing)) 
decomp(surface-request(m, r, informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))), 
askref(m, r, whoIsGoing)) 
decomp(surface-request(m, r, informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))), 
askif(m, r, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))) 
In this case, the possibility that Mother is attempting a pretelling was considered. (The 
system uses an oracle, represented by the default pickForm, to simulate this choice. 35) 
It is important to note that this is just one of the possible explanations available to 
Russ. Nothing in his beliefs rules out abducing explanations from either the askif or 
the askref interpretation. 
To satisfy the second premise of the rule, the reasoner must explain: 
try(m, r, pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing), ts(0)) 
Two kinds of explanation are possible: a hearer might assume that the act fulfills 
the speaker's intention to coherently extend the discourse as he has understood it or 
35 This oracle thus allows the analyst o test different interpretations. 
458 
McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
he might assume that one of the two types of misunderstanding has occurred. 36If 
a discourse has just begun, then any utterance that starts an adjacency pair will be 
coherent. In this case, Russ finds that the former type of explanation is possible using 
the metaplan (for plan adoption) to explain shouldTry(m, r, pretell(m, r whoIsGoing), 
ts(0)). The relevant defaults are repeated here: 
DEFAULT (1, intentionalAct(sl, $2, a, ts) ) : 
shouldTry( sl, s2, a, ts ) 
D try(s1, $2, a, ts). 
DEFAULT (3, adoptPlan (st, $2, al, a2, ts) ) : 
hasGoal(sl, do(s2, a2), ts) 
A wouldExpect(sl, do(s1, al), do(s2, a2)) 
D shouldTry(sl, s2, al, ts). 
The conditions of the metaplan are satisfiable because there is a plausible goal 
act that a pretelling would help Mother to achieve and it is consistent for Russ to 
assume that achieving this act was, in fact, her goal. 37 Also, when we consider possible 
evidence against Mother adopting this plan, namely whether the linguistic intentions 
of pretelling were incompatible with those that have been expressed, it would be 
consistent to assume that Mother is intending this plan. 
Russ infers 
wouldExpect(r, pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing), askref(r, m, whoIsGoing)) 
because he has a linguistic expectation to that effect: 
FACT lexpectation(do(m, pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing)), 
knowsBetterRef(m, r  whoIsGoing), 
do(r, askref(r, m, whoIsGoing))). 
4.4 Turn 2: Russ decides to respond with an askref 
In turn 2, Russ produces a surface-request. This utterance is appropriate, independent 
of whether or not Russ actually wants to know who is going to the meeting, because 
it displays acceptance of Mother's pretelling. From Russ's perspective it displays ac- 
ceptance, because a surface-request i  one way to perform an askref, an act that is 
expected according to Russ's model of the discourse after the first turn. 38 
As shown in Figure 7, Theorist finds that if Russ accepts Mother's pretelling, he 
should perform an askref. An askref would demonstrate acceptance because it is the 
expected next act. The derivation of this act relies on the rule for intentional action 
shown earlier in Section 4.3, along with the metaplan for acceptance r peated here: 
36 The former possibility admits that an utterance that displays a misconception, such as a mistaken belief 
about initial knowledge, might still be coherent, unless such knowledge has been introduced into the 
discourse xplicitly. Misconceptions are addressed by second-turn epairs, which are not considered 
here. 
37 Because Russ's previous utterance had not been the first part of an adjacency pair, he cannot explain 
her utterance as acceptance or challenge. 
38 If, for some reason, Russ did not want to know the information, he might decide not to produce an 
askref. However, he would then be accountable for justifying his action as well as for displaying his 
acceptance of Mother's displayed understanding (e.g., by including an explicit rejection of her offer); 
otherwise she might think that one of them has misunderstood.

McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
If we assume that Mother produced the first turn as an askif, she might also hear T2 as an 
intentional askref, but for a reason different han Russ would. Her explanation would include 
the metaplanning assumption that he was doing so as part of an adopted plan to get her to 
produce an informref. Although T2 might also be explained by abducing that Russ misunder- 
stood T1 as an attempted pretelling, we see that she considers this explanation to be less likely 
because otherwise she would have been more inclined to make T3 a third-turn repair ("No, I 'm 
asking you"). 40 
Plan adoption (see Table 1) provides Mother a plausible xplanation for T2 because: 
1. wouldExpect(r, askref(r, m, whoIsGoing), informref(m, r, whoIsGoing)) is explained 
because Mother has a linguistic expectation that says that an askref normally creates an 
expectation for the listener to tell the speaker the answer: 
~ACT lexpectation(do(r, askref(r, m, whoIsGoing)), 
knowref(m, whoIsGoing), 
do(m, informref(m, r, whoIsGoing))). 
2. Mother's credulousness about Russ's goals explains her belief that he wants her to 
perform the expected informref. 
3. The linguistic intentions of askref are compatible with those that have been expressed, 
so it is consistent to assume that Russ is intending to use it as part of a plan. (They are 
consistent with the context because T1 expresses only that Mother does not know 
whether Russ knows and not that she does not herself know.) 
4. Thus, by 1-3 and the metaplan for plan adoption, shouldTry(r, m, askref(r, m, 
whoIsGoing), ts(0)) is explainable. 
Assuming this interpretation, Mother can then demonstrate acceptance using an inform-not- 
knowref.

we wi l l  repeat  this rule and  then sketch the proof,  cons ider ing  each of the premises  
in the default .  
40 In the model, it is always possible to begin an embedded sequence without addressing the question on 
the floor; however, when the embedded sequence is complete, the top-level one is resumed. It is a 
limitation of the model that we do not distinguish interruptions from clarifications. 
41 For Russ to have heard T3 as demonstrating Mother's acceptance of his T2 (i.e., as a display of 
understanding), the linguistic intentions of inform(m, r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing)) would need to 
have been compatible with this interpretation f the discourse. However, not knowref(m, 
whoIsGoing) is among these intentions, while active(knowref(m, whoIsGoing),ts(2)). As a result, T3 
cannot be attributed to any expected act, and must be attributed to a misunderstanding either by Russ 
or by Mother.

McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
Premise 1: A pretelling was active in ts(2), because of Russ's interpretation of
T1.42 
Premises 24: A pretelling would be incompatible with an inform-not-knowref 
happening now. The linguistic intentions of the pretelling are: 
and(knowref(m, whoIsGoing), 
and(knowsBetterRef(m, r, whoIsGoing), 
and(intend(m, do(m, informref(m, r  whoIsGoing))), 
intend(m, knowref(r, wholsGoing))))) 
The linguistic intentions of inform-not-knowref are: 
and(not knowref(m, whoIsGoing), 
intend(m, knowif(r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing)))). 
But these intentions are inconsistent, because knowref(m, whoIsGoing) 
and not knowref(m, whoIsGoing) are incompatible. As a result, 
inconsistentLI holds for these linguistic intentions. 
Premise 5: This is a plausible mistake because the acts pretell and askref both 
have the same surface form: 
surface-request(m, r, informif(r, m, knowref(r, whoIsGoing))) 
So, ambiguous(pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing), askref(m, r, whoIsGoing)). 
The constraints: There is no other coherent interpretation, so it is consistent to 
assume that a misunderstanding occurred: 
selfMisunderstanding(m,r, 
mistake(r, askref(m, r, whoIsGoing), 
pretell(m, r, whoIsGoing)), 
inform(m, r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing)), 
ts(2)). 
Thus, try(m, r, inform(m, r, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing)), ts(2)) is explained. As 
a result of this interpretation, not knowref(m, whoIsGoing) is added to the discourse 
model as the fact expressedNot(knowref(m, whoIsGoing)). This addition terminates 
the activation of knowref(m, whoIsGoing) from the first turn. (At the same time, if 
Russ had revised any of his real beliefs on the basis of the first turn, he might now 
reconsider those revisions; however, our theory does not account for this.) 
4.6 Turn 4: Russ performs a repair 
After revising his understanding of Turn 1, Russ performs a surface-informref that 
displays his acceptance of the revised interpretation. When Theorist is called to find a 
coherent discourse-level act (i.e., by using the default for intentional cts) it finds that 
Russ can perform a fourth-turn repair. The metaplan for this repair, repeated below, is 
similar to that for acceptance, but involves the reconstruction f the discourse model. 
42 In the discourse model, this was expressed asexpressed(do(m, preteU(m, r, whoIsGoing)), 0), from 
which one can assume persists(do(m, pretell(m, r, wholsGoing)), 2) by default.

A reconstruction (ts, tSreconstructed) 
A expected(s1, areply, tSreconstructed) 
3 shouldTry(sl, 82, areply, ts). 
This metaplan applies because Russ had misunderstood a prior utterance by Mother, 
a reconstruction f the discourse is possible, and, within the reconstructed discourse, 
an informref is expected (as a reply to the misunderstood askref). 43 
An informref by Russ is expected (see Section 3.3.3) in the reconstructed dialogue 
because: 
? There is a linguistic expectation corresponding to the adjacency pair 
askref-informref . 
? Russ believes its conditions. 
? The linguistic intentions of informref are compatible with the 
reconstruction. 
5. Related work 
5.1 Accounts based on plan recognition 
Plan-based accounts interpret speech acts by chaining from subaction to action, from 
actions to effects of other actions, and from preconditions to actions to identify a 
plan (i.e., a set of actions) that includes the observed act. Heuristics are applied to 
discriminate among alternatives. 
5.1.1 Allen and Perrault. Allen and Perrault (1979), Perrault and Allen (1980) show 
how plan recognition can be used to understand indirect speech acts (such as the 
use of "Can you pass the salt?" as a polite request o pass the salt). To interpret an 
utterance, the approach applies a set of context-independent inference rules to identify 
all plausible plans. For example, one rule says that if a speaker wants to know the truth 
value of some proposition, then she might want the proposition to be made true. The 
final interpretation is then determined by a set of rating heuristics, such as "Decrease 
the rating of a path if it contains an action whose effects are already true at the time the 
action starts." These rating heuristics are problematic because they conflate linguistic 
and pragmatic knowledge with knowledge about the search mechanism itself. This 
approach cannot handle more than a few relationships between utterances and plans 
and cannot handle any utterances that do not relate to the domain plan in a direct 
manner. 
Although we have not yet considered the problem of indirect utterances in detail, 
we anticipate that such explanations might include as a subtask the kind of plan- 
based inference that has been proposed, but this inference would be limited by the 
hearer's own goals and expectations. However, many common uses of indirectness 
can be explained by the existence of a well-accepted social convention that makes 
them expected. 
43 From Mother's perspective, if indeed she did make an askif in T1, T4 can be seen as a display of 
acceptance of it, because a surface-informref is one way to do an informif. Thus, from her perspective, 
she need never recognize that Russ has misunderstood.

5.1.2 Litman. Work by Litman (1986) attempts to overcome some of the limitations of 
Allen and Perrault's approach by extending the plan hierarchy to include discourse- 
level metaplans, in addition to domain-level p ans. Metaplans include actions, such as 
introduce, continue, or clarify and are recognized, in part, by identifying cue phrases. 
Although the metaplans add flexibility by increasing the number of possible paths, 
they also add to the problem of pruning and ordering the paths, requiring additional 
heuristics. For example, there are specific rules for choosing among alternative meta- 
plans on the basis of clue words, implicit expectations, or default preferences. Litman 
also adds a new general heuristic: stop chaining if an ambiguity cannot be resolved. 
5.1.3 Carberry and Lambert. Carberry (1985, 1987, 1990) uses a similar approach. 
Her model introduces a new set of discourse-level goals such as seek-confirmation that 
are recognized on the basis of the current properties of the dialogue model and the 
mutual beliefs of the participants. Once a discourse-level goal is selected, a set of can- 
465 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
didate plans is identified, and Allen-style heuristics are applied to choose one of them. 
Subsequent work by Lambert and Carberry (1991, 1992) introduces an intermediate, 
problem-solving level of plans that link the discourse-level acts to domain plans. The 
processing rules, by their specificity, eliminate the need for many of the heuristics. The 
sacrifice here is a loss of generality; the mechanisms for recognizing oals are specific 
to Carberry's implementation. 
5.1.4 Cawsey. Cawsey (1991) proposes a method of extending Perrault and Allen's 
(1980) inference rule approach to produce repairs. She also suggests including some 
of the information captured by various rating heuristics as premises in the rules, allow- 
ing that these new premises may be assumed by default. For example, the following 
rule is proposed for capturing pretellings: 
if request(Sl, S2, informif(S2, Sl, knowref(S2, D))) 
and know(S2, knowref(Sl, D)) 
then know(S2, wants(Sl, knowref(S2, D))) 
To handle misunderstandings, she suggests that such assumptions be retracted 
if they become inconsistent and then any subsequent utterance whose interpretation 
depends on a retracted belief be reinterpreted from scratch. This approach is thus 
much stronger than most accounts of negotiation, such as ours, which allow that a 
participant might choose to forego a complete repair. Allowing defeasible beliefs is a 
step in the right direction; however, the approach still misses the point that participants 
are able to negotiate meanings. Preconditions such as know(S2, not knowref (Sl, D)) 
influence interpretations only to the extent that they provide support for, or evidence 
against, a particular (abductive) explanation. In Example 2, even if Mother knew who 
was going, she could still be asking Russ a question, albeit insincerely. Similarly, even if 
Russ suspected that Mother did not know who was going, he might still have chosen 
to treat her utterance as a pretelling, perhaps to confirm his suspicions or to delay 
answering. 
5.1.5 Traum and Hinkelman. Hinkelman's (1990) work incorporates some abductive 
reasoning in her model of utterance interpretation. The model treats different features 
in the input, such as the mood of a sentence or the presence of a particular lexical 
item, as manifestations of different speech acts. During interpretation, procedures that 
test for particular features of the input suggest candidates. The system then removes 
any candidates whose implicatures are inconsistent with prior beliefs. 
Traum and Hinkelman (1992) extend this work by generalizing the notion of 
speech act to conversation act. Conversation acts include traditional speech act types as 
well as what Traum and Hinkelman call grounding acts. Conversation acts, however, are 
not assumed to be understood without some positive vidence by the receiver, such as 
an acknowledgment. Grounding acts include initiating, clarifying, or acknowledging 
an utterance, and taking and releasing a turns. These acts differ from our own meta- 
plans in that they are organized into a finite state grammar, and do not account for 
grounding acts that would violate a receiver's expectations. In conversation, ground- 
ing acts that violate the grammar are not recognized. Traum and Hinkelman suggest 
that such violations hould be used to trigger a repair, but admit that, except when a 
repair has been requested explicitly, the model itself says nothing about when a repair 
should be uttered (p. 593). 44 
44 Interpretations that have the right pragmatic force but inconsistent implicatures are ruled out as in 
466 
McRoy and  Hirst  The Repair  of Speech Act M isunders tand ings  
Traum and Allen (1994) extend the work to include a notion of social obligation, 
which serves much the same purpose as expectations in our model. 
5.2 Other expectation-driven accounts 
Within the speech understanding community, the word "expectation" has been used 
differently from our use here. Expectation i the speech context refers to what the next 
word or utterance is likely to be about. 45 For example, after the computer asks the user 
to perform some action A, it might expect any of the following types of responses: 
1. A statement about background knowledge that might be needed. 
2. A statement about the underlying purpose of A. 
3. A statement about related task steps (i.e., subgoals of A, tasks that 
contain A as a step, or tasks that might follow A). 
4. A statement about the accomplishment of A. 
These expectations are independent of the belief state of an agent and are specified 
down to the semantic (and sometimes even lexical) level. This information has long 
been used to discriminate between ambiguous interpretations and correct mistakes 
made by the speech recognizer (Fink and Biermann 1986; Smith 1992). Typically, an 
utterance will be interpreted according to the expectation that matches it most closely. 
By contrast, our approach and that of the plan-based accounts use "expectation" to
refer to agents' beliefs about how future utterances might relate to prior ones. These 
expectations are determined both by an agent's understanding of typical behavior and 
by his or her mental state. These two notions of expectation are complementary, and 
any dialogue model that uses speech as input must be able to represent and reason 
with both. 
5.3 Approaches to misconception 
Misconceptions are a deficit in an agent's knowledge of the world; they can become a
barrier to understanding if they cause an agent o unintentionally evoke a concept or 
relation. To prevent misconceptions from triggering a misunderstanding, a ents can 
check for evidence of misconception a d try to resolve apparent errors. The symptoms 
of misconception i clude references to entities that do not map to previously known 
objects or operations (Webber and Mays 1983) or requests for clarification (Moore 
1989). Errors are corrected by replacing or deleting parts of the problematic utterance 
so that it makes sense. Several correction strategies have been suggested: 
? Generalize a description by selectively ignoring some constraints ( ee 
Goodman 1985; McCoy 1985, 1986, 1988; Carberry 1988; Calistri-Yeh 
1991; Eller and Carberry 1992), 
? Make a description more specific by adding extra constraints ( ee Eller 
and Carberry 1992), and 
? Choose a conceptual "sibling", by combining eneralization a d 
constraint operations. For example, if there is more than one strategy for 
Hinkelman (1990); however, as with grounding acts, presumably the elimination of all possible 
interpretations could cue some type of repair mechanism, if they chose to incorporate one. 
45 This is the same sense of "expectation" as used by Riesbeck (1974). 
467 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 
achieving a goal, then an entity that corresponds to a step from one 
strategy might be replaced by one corresponding to a step from one of 
the other strategies (see Carberry 1985, 1987; Eller and Carberry 1992; 
Moore 1989). 
Although these approaches do quite well at preventing certain classes of misun- 
derstandings, they cannot prevent hem all. Moreover, these approaches may actually 
trigger misunderstandings because they always find some substitution, and yet they 
lack any mechanisms for detecting when one of their own previous repairs was inap- 
propriate. Thus, a conversational participant will still need to be able to address actual 
misunderstandings. 
5.4 Collaboration in the resolution of nonunderstanding 
In this paper, we have concentrated on the repair of mis-understanding. Our colleagues 
Heeman and Edmonds have looked at the repair of non-understanding. The difference 
between the two situations is that in the former, the agent derives exactly one inter- 
pretation of an utterance and hence is initially unaware of any problem; in the latter, 
the agent derives either more than one interpretation, with no way to choose between 
them, or no interpretation atall, and so the problem is immediately apparent. Heeman 
and Edmonds looked in particular at cases in which a referring expression uttered by 
one conversant was not understood by the other (Heeman and Hirst 1995; Edmonds 
1994; Hirst et al 1994). Clark and his colleagues (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986; Clark 
1993) have shown that in such situations, conversants will collaborate on repairing 
the problem by, in effect, negotiating a reconstruction or elaboration of the referring 
expression. Heeman and Edmonds model this with a plan recognition and generation 
system that can recognize faulty plans and try to repair them. Thus (as in our own 
model) two copies of the system can converse with each other, negotiating referents 
of referring expressions that are not understood by trying to recognize the referring 
plans of the other, repairing them where necessary, and presenting the new referring 
plan to the other for approval. 
6. Conclusions 
In human dialogues, both the producer and the recipient of an utterance have a say 
in determining its interpretation. Moreover, they may both change their minds in 
the face of new information. Dialogue participants are able to negotiate the meaning 
of utterances because in responding to what the hearer decides are the speaker's 
goals and expectations regarding an utterance, the hearer also provides evidence of 
that decision and hence constraints on what the speaker may do next. If the speaker 
disagrees with a displayed interpretation, she can challenge it directly or decide to 
respond in such a way that the hearer must infer a misunderstanding. 
The long-term goal of our work is to construct a model of communicative interac- 
tion that will be able to support he negotiation of meaning. We have considered the 
information sources and reasoning processes that agents need to determine their be- 
liefs about he goals and expectations a sociated with each other's utterances. Whereas 
previous models of dialogue tend to represent discourse meaning from some global 
perspective, make use of either purely structural or purely intentional information, 
and give minimal attention to repair, in our model: 
? Each agent has his or her own model of the discourse. 
468 
McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings 
? Agents rely on both structural and intentional information in the 
discourse. 
? Agents distinguish between intended actions and misunderstandings. 
? Agents interpret utterances on the basis of expectations derived from 
previous utterances as well as expectations for future actions that are 
predicted by the utterance under interpretation. 
? Agents are able to detect and repair their own misunderstandings as 
well as those of others. 
We see this work as providing some of the first steps toward a unified account of 
interpretation, generation, and repair. 
The primary contributions of this work have been to treat misunderstanding and 
repair as intrinsic to conversants' core language abilities and to account for them with 
the same processing mechanisms that account for normal speech. In particular, both 
interpretation and repair are treated as explanation problems, modeled as abduction. 
In order to account for the repair of misunderstandings, we have proposed a repre- 
sentation of the discourse that captures the agent's interpretation of the conversation 
both before and after a repair and that is independent of the actual beliefs of the 
participants--a dynamic mental artifact that is the object of belief and repair. With 
such a record of the discourse, agents can refer to alternative interpretations or to the 
repair process itself, potentially enabling them to recover from rejected repairs. By 
addressing the problem of repair, this work should facilitate efforts to build natural 
language interfaces that can better recover from their own mistakes as well as those 
of their users.

Appendix A: A third-turn repair 
This appendix gives an annotated version of the output for the following example of 
third-turn repair (from McLaughlin (1984)). We will consider the results of a simulation 
in which two copies of our system, each with its own beliefs and goals, converse with 
each other. 
Example 4 
T1 A: When is the dinner for Alfred? 
T2 B: Is it at seven-thirty? 
T3 A: No, I'm asking you. 
T4 B: Oh, I don't know. 
For this example, we assume that A (a) wants B (b) to tell her the time of the 
dinner for Alfred, that she believes that she does not already know, that he knows 
when it is, and that he believes that she does not know, of any given time (including 
seven-thirty), whether it is the time of the dinner. Notice that the last belief of a, is 
her belief about what b believes about what she knows.

We also assume that speaker b, believes that he does not know the time of the dinner,

Agent a adopted plan to achieve: assertref(b,a,whenD) 
Speaker b now replies: Is it at seven-thirty? 
He produces this reply because he has a linguistic expectation that says that "if someone is 
testing you and you suspect hat X is the answer to their test, the appropriate thing to do 
is to (tentatively) propose X as the answer" .  46 (In the explanation below, this expectation 
is indicated by the default "expectedRep ly ' ) .

46 suspectRef, like knowsBetterRef, is a supposition of a less than certain belief that an agent knows the 
answer. Except for allowing an agent he (extra) possibility of responding with askif, it expresses the 
same information as not knowref. Under our initial assumptions, speaker b might also have answered 
"I don't know."
