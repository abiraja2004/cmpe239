ABSTRACT 
This paper addresses two main questions: (a) Can listeners as- 
sign values of perceived boundary strength to the juncture 
between any two words? (b) If so, what is the relationship 
between these values and various (combinations of) 
suprasegmental features. Three speakers read a set of twenty 
utterances of varying length and complexity. A panel of 
nineteen listeners assigned boundary strength values to each of 
the 175 word boundaries in the material. Then the correlation 
was established between the variable strength of the perceived 
boundaries and three prosodic variables: melodic discontinuity, 
declination reset and pause. The results show that speakers may 
differ in their strategies of prosodic boundary marking and 
listeners agree in the perceptual weight they attribute to the 
prosodic ues. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Any two successive words may vary as to their syntactic 
or semantic ohesiveness. The latter is likely to be strong- 
er if the two words are part of the same linguistic con- 
stituent; conversely, the occurrence of a constituent boun- 
dary between words decreases their degree of cohesive- 
ness. For example, in the sentence "(the man) (is sitting) 
(in the chair)", any two words separated by round brack- 
ets are structurally farther apart than those within a pair 
of brackets. Speakers are capable of making the juncture 
between constituents audible by prosodic means: they 
may produce appropriate cues in terms of pause, pitch 
and duration parameters. Listeners, on the other hand, can 
make use of these cues to segment he incoming flow of 
speech into word sequences that may be treated as a 
whole, which facilitates the comprehension process. In 
certain cases, prosodic demarcation may help in resolving 
structural ambiguity, for instance in utterances of the type 
"The girl saw the man with the telescope", in which the 
prepositional phrase specifies either the verb or its direct 
object \[1, 2\]. But in utterances containing no surface syn- 
tactic homonymy, too, prosodic boundaries may delineate 
coherent word groups and lend support to the listener's 
hypotheses about syntactic-semantic structure as, for in- 
stance, in "the beautiful girl / with brown eyes / told her 
story / to the psychiatrist" \[3\]. 
This paper presents results of research that, starting from 
the observation that listeners do provide prosodic boun- 
dary cues, addresses two main questions: 
(a) Can listeners assign a value of Perceived Boundary 
Strength (PBS) to word boundaries? 
(b) If so, what is the relationship between PBS and dif- 
ferent (combinations of) suprasegmental features? 
The answer to these questions may lead to a better model 
of what prosodic resources a speaker can draw on to 
highlight the syntactic-semantic structure of an utterance. 
Such insight may, in turn, contribute to improved prosody 
in speech synthesis, by making it sound more natural and 
-more importantly- by making it linguistically more 
transparent and therefore easier to comprehend. This re- 
search may also shed light on how a listener makes use 
of the demarcative information encoded in prosodic fea- 
tures. In that respect, it has relevance for (knowledge- 
based) automatic speech recognition, where the inclusion 
of prosodic information may support he syntactic-seman- 
tic parse of the input, especially if the latter contains 
structural ambiguities. 
This line of research is in agreement with the growing 
interest in the communicative function of prosody, which 
may contain information ot only about utterance-internal 
phrasing, as already suggested above \[4\], but also about 
the topical organization of discourse in monologues and 
dialogues \[5\] or about speaker-dependent features uch as 
emotional state \[6\]. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH 
In this section we present part of the results obtained in 
an experiment that aimed at answering the two questions 
mentioned in the introduction. 'Ib this effect we have 
collected appropriate speech material, in which we asked 
listeners to score the PBS of each word boundary. Sub- 
sequently, the material was subjected to various phonetic 
analyses, the results of which were then correlated with 
the PBS's. Finally, the predictions of an algorithm that 
assigns prosodic structure to unmarked text were verified 
against he PBS's.

2.1. Speech Material 
A set of twenty Dutch sentences was constructed, which 
differed sufficiently in length and complexity to warrant 
the occurrence of prosodic boundaries of varying 
strengths. These sentences contained a total of  175 word 
boundaries. This set was read out by three native spea- 
kers: two males, of whom one was a professional speaker, 
and one female. To evaluate the possible influence of 
syntactic and semantic information, all 20 utterances spo- 
ken by the professional speaker and 3 of the utterances 
spoken by the other two were processed in such a way 
that the contents of the utterances was rendered unintelli- 
gible, while the prosodic features were kept intact. In this 
way, a so-called 'delexical ized' version of the test materi- 
al was created m addition to the 'normal'  version. 
2.2. PBS Assignment 
In a number of successive sessions, nineteen listeners 
were confronted with the 3 x 20 = 60 utterances in the 
normal version and the (1 x 20) + (2x  3) = 26 in the 
delexicalized version. They were asked to indicate, on a 
10-point scale, how strong they felt the juncture at each 
word boundary to be. The mean of the nineteen scores 
per word boundary was taken as a measure of the percep- 
tual boundary strength (PBS) of that word boundary. 
Thus, the PBS was obtained for each word boundary as 
produced by each of the speakers in each test version. 
An example of the PBS values obtained for one of the 
test utterances is shown in Figure la. As can be seen, 
listeners appear to be quite capable of distinguishing a
diversity of PBS values, both in the lexical and delexical 
conditions. 
2.3 Phonetic Analysis 
The acoustic / phonetic analysis of the material concen- 
trated on the speakers' use of pauses and intonation to 
highlight word boundaries. It was determined for each 
word boundary in the 60 utterances 1) whether there was 
a pause and, if so, of what length; 2) whether there was 
melodic discontinuity across the boundary and, if so, of 
342 
what type; and 3) whether the boundary was associated 
with a declination reset. 
The location and length of pauses were determined by 
straightforward inspection of the wavetbrms. Melodic 
transcriptions of the 60 utterances were obtained by a 
combination of pitch measurement, pitch stylization and 
independent perceptual evaluation by experts, l,'ollowing 
the typology outlined in 't l lart et al (171, p.81), lbur 
types of melodic discontinuity were distinguished in the 
way the speakers marked the word boundaries: ?10, 1E, 
12, IA2'.  
Figure lb presenls a survey of the results of the phonetic 
analyses for one of the test utterances. 
3. RESULTS 
For all three speakers, a high correlation was found be- 
tween the PBS's obtained in the normal and delexicalized 
test versions (r, = .78, p < .01). This warrants the con- 
clusion that, in this experiment, syntactic and semantic 
factors did not affect the listeners' judgments. The delexi- 
calized test version is ignored in the rest of this paper.

Table 1: Frequency of occurrence of the three phonetic 
cues across the three speakers. 
The three speakers appear to make different use of phone- 
tic cues to mark prosodic boundaries, as shown in 
Table 1. The table shows that the professional speaker 
made more extensive use of all three phonetic cues than 
the other two speakers and was the only one to employ 
declination resets in a systematic fashion. Not shown in 
the table is the t~ct that there were also clear differences 
between the speakers in preferred type of melodic discon- 
tinuity. 
Combinations of the three cues can be considered as pos- 
sible phonetic strategies of the speakers to mark prosodic 
boundaries. Figure 2 shows the relation of these strategies 
to PBS. Generally speaking, PBS values are higher as 
more phonetic cues are associated with a given word 
boundary. While the speakers differ in their preferences 
for certain strategies, the impact of strategy on Pi\]S is 
roughly the same across speakers. 
Additional trends not shown in l"igure 2 are the follow- 
ing. First, there was a trend for longer pauses to be as- 
sociated with greater t'BS's for all speakers. As for the 
tour types of melodic discontinuity, the main tendency is 
that melodic discontinuity inw)lving a continuation rise

able) is associated with greater PBS's than other types. 
The data show strong interactions between the three pho- 
netic cues. "/'he main observations are that l) the presence 
of a declination reset implies the presence of a pause in 
all cases, 2) the presence of a pause implies the presence 
of a melodic discontinuity in about 80% of the cases, for 
all speakers, 3) pauses not accompanied by a melodic cue 
are usually shorter than 100 ms, and 4) it is quite com- 
mon for word boundaries to be marked only by a melodic 
cue. 
3.2. Perceptual Boundary Strength And 
P~sodic Boundaries 
The prosodic analysis of the test material consisted of the 
application of the latest version of the so-called Pros-3 
algorithm \[8\]. This is a program currently under develop- 
ment at IPO to automatically determine accent and proso- 
dic phrase structure of sentences on the basis of syntactic 
and metrical analysis. In this way, each word boundary 
was assigned to one of three predicted prosodic boundary 
categories: no boundary, Phi-boundary or I-boundary. 
343 
As can be seen in figure 3, word boundaries that were 
designated as I-boundaries by the Pros-3 algorithm have 
greater PBS's than Phi-boundaries, while these in turn are 
perceived as stronger than unlabelled boundaries. This 
effect is apparent for all speakers, but is clearest in the 
professional speaker.

be exploited tentatively in text-to-speech conversion and 
in automatic speech recognition. 
Finally, the gradience that can be observed in the PBS 
values of Figure 2, shows that listeners can do better than 
merely distinguishing between presence or absence of a 
boundary. On the basis of our limited set of data, it is not 
possible to determine xactly how many categories liste- 
ners can discriminate reliably. This will be partly deter- 
mined by the number and the nature of  the phonetic cues, 
and need not be limited to a maximum of three (no boun- 
dary, minor boundary, major boundary). Indeed, Figure 2 
suggests that it is not unreasonable to assume that liste- 
ners can handle five PBS categories. Interestingly, such a 
five-level distinction is used in the TOBI labelling 
scheme \[9\]. However, an important difference between 
the two approaches i that the TOBI scheme obliges labe- 
lers to explicitly assess the nature of the phonetic cues, 
while PBS values are the result of a purely intuitive judg- 
ment.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
Our experimental investigation has brought to light that 
speakers and listeners alike are aware of the role pitch 
and pause can play in utterance-internal phrasing. These 
prosodic parameters can effectively highlight how the 
utterance is to be chunked into coherent word groups. As 
is often the case with prosody, there is no obligation on 
the speaker's side to actually use pitch or pause for a 
communicative purpose, such as boundary marking. In 
fact, we have seen (in Table 1) that our professional 
speaker produces more numerous prosodic cues and that 
all three speakers differ in the relative frequency of use of 
pitch or pause devices. But, whenever listeners are of- 
fered particular (combinations of) prosodic cues, they 
agree well on how to interpret hem in terms of P/3S (see 
Figure 2). Thus, there seems to be prosodic freedom on 
the speaker's ide, while the listener cannot help but pay 
attention to melodic or temporal cues whenever they are 
present. 
Apparently, a certain amount of gradience is involved in 
the marking of constituent boundaries: the strength of a 
prosodic boundary reflects to some extent the depth of 
the syntactic-semantic juncture at a given point in the ut- 
terance. It is not unlikely that the inclusion of  additional 
prosodic parameters, such as local variations in speech 
rhythm (in particular preboundary lengthening), will add 
detail to the emerging picture of syntax-to-prosody cor- 
respondence. But pitch and pause alone already show 
sufficiently clear relations to the linguistic structure of the 
utterance, that their capacity to reveal this structure can
