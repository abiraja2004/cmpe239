Context-free grammars (CFG) describe the possible 
derivations of a Non-Terminal (NT), denoted by A, inde- 
pendently of the context (or tree) in which this NT (also re- 
ferred to as constituent) occurs. Typically there are several 
rewrite rules for a particular NT A. One straight-forward 
method for using a probabilistic model is to define a prob- 
abilistic CFG (PCFG) which assigns probabilities to the 
rewrite rules of a NT A that sum to one. This simple 
model therefore assumes a probabilistic independence as- 
sumption that the choice of the rule to expand A is inde- 
pendent of the context (parse tree) in which A occurs. As 
has transpired in the discussion period, this strong assump- 
tion was found to be objectionable by many. Several in the 
audience suggested using other grammatical formalisms to 
put probabilities on, where the independence assumption 
may be more acceptable. While this may be an approach, 
I suspect hat there is a gold mine in using PCFG in a 
manner that is slightly more sophisticated than the above 
approach. For example, as Magerman and Marcus  (and 
reference 3 in their paper) suggest, one may assign that the 
rewrite rule probability depend on the parent rule and the 
trigram of part-of-speech categories centered on the word 
that is the left corner of the rewrite rule. Other condi- 
tionings are possible and care should be taken that the 
parameters of the resulting probabilistic model can be es- 
timated reliably from the training corpus. I think whether 
PCFGs or more sophisticated probabilistic grammars are 
needed for language processing would be best answered by 
using empirical experiments using standardized tests to al- 
low for meaningful comparisons. To foster such a research 
program several ingredients are needed: 
? Grammars (whether context free or not) that have a 
large enough coverage with a reasonable number of 
parses (say that the correct parse is with probability 
99% in the top N parses where N is some agreed 
upon number.) 
? Standard blind test sets annotated with the correct 
parse. See the paper by Black et alin these proceed- 
ings where a common marking is proposed. 
? Standard training sets to allow parameter estimation 
and grammar development. 
has a strong independence assumption that has not yet 
shown to be a drastic barrier to improved performance. 
Four of the five papers in this session address issues 
with PCFGs. Paper #2 by DeMor i  and Kuhn extends 
the algorithm to compute the probability that a sequence 
of words is an initial (prefix) substring of a sentence (see 
reference 8 in DeMori and Kuhn) to handle the case of an 
island: the probability that a string of words is an island 
(i.e., occur somewhere in a sentence.) They point out that 
the resulting computation is impractical. But they identify 
the special case where the gap length to the left of the is- 
land is known. Extending the gap length by one is only cu- 
bic. (In Paper #2, a dynamic cache language model using 
a tri-part-of-speech model is also described.) Paper #4 by 
Koch lnan  and Kup in  presents an algorithm that com- 
putes the probability that an LR parser for a PCFG will 
complete (accept a sentence.) Thereby, deriving the prefix 
probability (involves a matrix inversion) and then deriving 
update rules to compute the joint probability of the parser 
stack and input substring. Paper #5 by Kup iec  presents 
a new organization on how to carry the probability compu- 
tations (for parameter estimation of PCFGs) based on an 
extension that uses several trellises (a la tbrward-backward 
algorithm). The. algorithm does not require the grammar 
to be in Chomsky Normal Form as required by the Inside- 
Outside algorithm but rather uses a recursive transition 
network representation f the grammar. As discussed ear- 
lier, Paper #3 by Magerman and Marcus  makes the 
case that rule probabilities should depend on more context. 
Ilowever, they quickly abandon the probabilistic approach 
in favor of a heuristic score citing shortcomings of the inde- 
pendence assumption and unreliable probability estimates. 
1 suspect that we will hear more on this subject as more 
empirical work is done to determine how best to deal with 
these issues. Finally, Paper #1 by Bobrow proposes a 
search strategy that uses several agenda to fill a chart in 
order to get an "acceptable" parse (a parse that leads to 
executable database access commands.) He introduces the 
use of the rule success probability which is estimated by 
frequency counts that the rule introduces terms that be- 
long to the "acceptable" parse. Using heuristic weigthlng 
of rule success probabilities yields a speedup by 1.8 com- 
pared to a full search CYK algorithm. 
In trying to assess the value of PCFGs, one cannot for- 
get the analogy to speech research where the HMM model
