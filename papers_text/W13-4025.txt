Abstract
We demonstrate a conversational interface
that assists pedestrian users in navigat-
ing within urban environments and acquir-
ing tourist information by combining spo-
ken dialogue system, question-answering
(QA), and geographic information sys-
tem (GIS) technologies. In contrast to
existing mobile applications which treat
these problems independently, our An-
droid agent addresses the problem of navi-
gation and touristic question-answering in
an integrated fashion using a shared dia-
logue context with multiple interleaved di-
alogue threads. In this paper, we present
the architecture and features of our lat-
est system, extended from an earlier ver-
sion which was built and evaluated with
real users (Janarthanam et al, 2013). The
new features include navigation based on
visible landmarks, navigation adapted to
the user?s previous route knowledge, and
tourist information pushing based on vis-
ible and proximal points-of-interest. The
system also uses social media to infer
?popularity? of geographical entities.
1 Introduction
We demonstrate a conversational interface that ad-
dresses the problems of pedestrian navigation and
Question Answering (QA) in urban environments,
which is an extended version of the system eval-
uated in (Janarthanam et al, 2013). Our system
brings together Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS)
and Question Answering (QA) with Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) for user positioning
and tracking, city modelling and urban visibility
modelling. There has been little prior work that
addresses these problems - navigation, visibility,
and tourist information provision - in an integrated
way. By navigation, we refer to the problem of
finding appropriate destinations to go to and the
task of wayfinding to reach them (Golledge, 1992;
Raubal and Winter, 2002) and by tourist informa-
tion provision we refer to the problem of meet-
ing the informational needs of a user about enti-
ties such as museums, statues, famous personal-
ities, etc. With the proliferation of smartphones,
there has been a number of mobile apps developed
to address these problems. However, these apps
have the following problems: first, they demand
the user?s visual attention because they predom-
inantly present information on a mobile screen.
This can be dangerous in urban environments, as
well as being distracting. Second, these apps ad-
dress the problems of navigation and tourist infor-
mation independently and do not employ a shared
interaction context. This means that users cannot
switch between tourist information and navigation
tasks in a natural and fluid manner.
User1: Take me to the National Museum.
System2: The National Museum is about 300 meters away ...
System3: At the KFC, turn left on to South Bridge ...
System4 : Near you is the statue of David Hume.
User2: Who is David Hume.
System5: David Hume was a Scottish philosopher....
User3: Tell me more about David Hume.

In contrast to existing mobile apps, we present
a system that has a speech-only interface and ad-
dresses navigation and QA in an integrated way.
Table 1 presents an example interaction with
our system showing the integrated use of navi-
gation and question-answering capabilities. Ut-
151
terance System4-8 shows the system?s capability
to push information from the QA system about
nearby points-of-interest (PoI) during a navigation
task, which the user can then follow-up on (in ut-
terances User2 and User3). The final 3 utterances
show a natural switch between navigation to an en-
tity and QA about that entity.
2 Related work
Mobile applications such as Siri, Google Maps
Navigation, Sygic, etc. address the problem of
navigation while applications like Triposo, Guide-
pal, Wikihood, etc. address the problem of tourist
information by presenting the user with descrip-
tive information about various points of interest
(PoI) in the city. While some exploratory applica-
tions present snippets of information about a pre-
compiled list of PoI, others applications dynam-
ically generate a list of PoI arranged based on
their proximity to the users. Users can also ob-
tain specific information about PoI using Search
applications. Also, since these navigation and ex-
ploratory/search applications do not address both
problems in an integrated way, users need to
switch between them and therefore lose interac-
tion context.
While most applications address these two
problems independently, some like Google Now,
Google Field Trip, etc, mix navigation with ex-
ploration. However, such applications present in-
formation primarily visually on the screen for the
user to read. In contrast, our system has the objec-
tive of keeping the user?s cognitive load low and
preventing users from being distracted (perhaps
dangerously so) from walking in the city (Kray et
al., 2003). Also, our system allows users to inter-
leave the two sub-tasks seamlessly and can keep
entities discussed in both tasks in shared context
(as shown in Table 1).
Several systems have addressed the issue of
pedestrian navigation (Malaka and Zipf, 2000;
Dale et al, 2003; Heinroth and Buhler, 2008).
Some dialogue systems deal with presenting in-
formation concerning points of interest (Ko et al,
2005; Misu and Kawahara, 2007; Kashioka et al,
2011). In contrast to all these earlier work, we
demonstrate a system that deals with both naviga-
tion and tourist information issues in an integrated
fashion.
Figure 1: System Architecture
3 Multithreaded dialogue management
The architecture of the current system is shown
in figure 1. The Interaction Manager (IM) is
the central component of this architecture, which
provides the user with navigational instructions,
pushes PoI information and manages QA ques-
tions. It receives the user?s input in the form of
a dialogue act (DA) from the ASR module and
the user?s location (latitude and longitude), orien-
tation and speed from the Pedestrian Tracker mod-
ule. Based on these inputs and the dialogue con-
text, the IM responds with a system output dia-
logue act. The Interaction Manager manages the
conversation using five coversational threads: di-
alogue control, response, navigation, question an-
swering, and PoI pushing. These different threads
represent the state of different dimensions of the
user-system conversation that interleave with each
other. Each of these threads generates a dialogue
action based on a dialogue policy. A dialogue pol-
icy is a mapping between dialogue states and dia-
logue actions, which are semantic representations
of what the system wants to say next. Dialogue
actions from the five threads are stored in five sep-
arate queues.
The queues are assigned priorities that decide
the order in which items from the queues will
be popped. For instance, informing the user of
a PoI could be delayed if the user needs to be
given an instruction to turn at the junction he is
approaching. For this reason, priority is assigned
to dialogue threads as follows.
Priority 1. Dialogue control (calibration phase,
repeat request, clarifications etc)
Priority 2. Responding to user requests
Priority 3. System initiated navigation task actions
Priority 4. Responses to User initiated QA actions
Priority 5. PoI Push actions
152
Dialogue control The IM initiates the conversa-
tion with a calibration phase where the user?s ini-
tial location and orientation are obtained. In this
phase, the IM requests the user to walk a few yards
so that the pedestrian tracker can sense the user?s
location and orientation. During the course of the
coversation, the IM uses this thread to manage
repeat requests, issues with unparsed user utter-
ances, utterances that have low ASR confidence,
and so on. The dialogue control thread is used to
manage reference resolution in cases where refer-
ring expressions are underspecified.
Navigation The IM identifies the location of the
destination entity and queries the City Model for a
route plan. The plan provides information such as
numbers of exits at junctions, the exit number the
user should take, turn angle, popularity index of
the street, and the slope of the road. In an attempt
to adapt the route instructions to user route knowl-
edge, the IM first picks the most popular street in
the plan and asks the users if they can get to the
street on their own. Also, the IM queries the Visi-
bility Engine (VE) for highly salient visible land-
marks (computed using Flickr tags) that can used
to direct the user. Instructions based on visible
landmarks are given whenever possible.
Question Answering The system also answers
ad hoc questions from the user (e.g. ?Who is David
Hume??, ?What is the Old College??, etc). These
are sent to the QA server and answered based on
responses from the QA server. The dialogue pol-
icy here is to answer the user?s question with the
first snippet available and ask the user to request
for more if interested.
Pushing PoI Information When the user is mo-
bile, the IM identifies points of interest on the
route based on two factors: proximity and visibil-
ity. Proximity push is done by checking for PoIs
near the user using high-scoring ones when there
are many, based on tourist popularity ratings in the
City Model. Visibility push is done by querying
the VE for salient entities visible to the user that
may be worth pushing. The dialogue policy is to
introduce the PoI entity along with visual descrip-
tors if available. The IM queries the QA server for
snippets on entity and if available, pushes them the
first snippet to the user. The user is encouraged to
ask for more if interested.
4 Conclusion
We demonstrate a mobile conversational system
to support pedestrian users in navigation and
question-answering tasks in urban environments.
The system is a speech-only interface and inter-
leaves navigation and tourist information in an in-
tegrated way, using a shared dialogue context. For
example, using the navigational context, our sys-
tem can push point-of-interest information which
can then initiate touristic exploration tasks using
the QA module. An evaluation of an earlier ver-
sion was reported in (Janarthanam et al, 2013).
