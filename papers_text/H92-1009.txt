ABSTRACT 
We have analyzed three factors affecting user satisfaction 
and system performance using an SLS implemented in the 
ATIS domain. We have found that: (I) trade-offs between 
speed and accuracy have different implications for user sat- 
isfaction; (2) recognition performance improves over time, 
at least in part because of a reduction in sentence perplex- 
ity; and (3) hyperarticulation increases recognition errors, 
and while instructions can reduce this behavior, they do not 
result in improved recognition performance. We conclude 
that while users may adapt o some aspects of an SLS, cer- 
tain types of user behavior may require technological solu- 
tions. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Data collection is a critical component of the DARPA Spo- 
ken Language Systems (SLS) program. Data are crucial not 
only for system training, development and evaluation, but 
also for analyses that can provide insight o guide future 
research and development. By observing users interacting 
with an SLS under different conditions, we can assess 
which issues may best be addressed by human factors and 
which will require technological solutions. System devel- 
opers can benefit from considering not only initial use of an 
SLS, but also the experience of a user over time. 
Systems based on current echnology work best when 
speech and language closely resemble the training data 
used to develop the system. However, there is considerable 
variability in the degree to which the speech and language 
of new users match that of the training data. The current 
paper examines the importance of this initial match. It is 
possible that users whose speech does not conform to the 
system may be able to adapt heir behavior over time (e.g., 
Stem and Rudnicky \[11\]). In order to evaluate technology 
in terms of the demands of the application, we need to 
understand the extent and the nature of such adaptation and 
the conditions that affect it. Although system performance 
can be measured in a number of ways, in this paper, we 
focus on (1) self-reports of user satisfaction, and (2) recog- 
nition performance. Further studies could include addi- 
tional measures. 
SRI has been collecting data in the air travel planning 
domain using a number of different systems (see Bly et al 
\[1\]; Kowtko and Price \[5\]). In moving from wizard-based 
data collection to the use of SRI's SLS, we observed 
changes in user behavior that were associated with system 
errors. Some of these behaviors were adaptive; for exam- 
ple, learning to avoid out-of-vocabulary words or unusual 
syntax should facilitate successful interaction. Other 
behaviors, however, were non-adaptive and could actually 
impede the interaction. For example, speaking more loudly 
or in a hyperarticulate style may be detrimental to system 
performance insofar as these styles differ from those 
observed in training material dominated by wizard-medi- 
ated data in which system errors are minimal. 
It is difficult o predict how well an SLS will need to per- 
form in order to be acceptable to users. Both speed and 
accuracy are crucial to system acceptability; we have there- 
fore collected ata using versions of the system that priori- 
tize one of these parameters atthe expense of the other. The 
present study first addresses the issue of user satisfaction 
with different levels of system speed and accuracy and then 
focuses on an example of an adaptive behavior and another 
that is maladaptive. These behaviors represent a subset of 
potential factors influencing human-machine interaction. 
Because these issues are not restricted to any particular sys- 
tem, they should be of general interest o developers of 
SLS technology. 
In the first study, we compared three points in the speed- 
accuracy space for this application: (1) an extremely slow 
but very accurate wizard-mediated system (described in 
Bly et al \[1\]) with a 2-3 minute response time and a mini- 
mal error rate; (2) a software version of the DECIPHER 
recognizer with a response time of several times real time 
and a fairly low word error rate; and (3) a version of the 
DECIPHER recognizer implemented in special-purpose 
hardware using older word models, which has a very fast 
response time but currently has a higher word error rate. 
49 
We compared user satisfaction based on responses to a 
post-session questionnaire. 
The second study investigated the effect of user experience 
on syntax and word choice. We hypothesized that one way 
users might adapt would be to conform to the language 
mode~s constraining recognition. We therefore measured 
recognition performance in subjects' first and second sce- 
narios, and compared sentence perplexities in order to 
determine whether any changes in recognition performance 
could be attributed to a change in perplexity. 
The third study examined the effect of hyperarticulate 
speech on recognition and tested whether instructions to 
users could reduce this potentially maladaptive behavior. 
We coded each utterance for hyperarticulation a d com- 
pared recognizer performance for normal and hyperarticu- 
late utterances. We also compared rates of hyperarticulation 
for subjects who were either given or not given the instruc- 
tions. 
2. DATA COLLECT ION METHODS 
2.1. Subjects 
Data from a total of 145 subjects were included in the anal- 
yses. Subsets of these data were chosen for inclusion in 
each analysis in order to counterbalance forgender and sce- 
nario. The majority of subjects were SRI employees 
recruited from an advertisement i  an intemal newsletter; a 
small number were students from a nearby university, 
employees in a local research corporation, or members of a 
volunteer organization. Subjects were native speakers of 
English, ranged in age from 22 to 71 and had varying 
degrees of experience with travel planning and computers. 
2.2. Materials 
Four different ravel-planning scenarios were used. One 
entailed arranging flights to two cities in three days; a sec- 
ond entailed finding two fares for the price of a first class 
fare; a third required coordinating the arrival times of three 
flights from different cities; and a fourth involved weighing 
factors such as fares and meals in order to choose between 
two flight times. Because the task demands of the scenarios 
were different, we controlled for scenario in the analyses. 
2.3. Apparatus 
The data were collected using two versions of SRI's SLS 
(with no human in the loop); the first study also included 
data collected in a Wizard of Oz setting (Bly et a.l. \[1\]). The 
basic characteristics of the DECIPHER speech recognition 
component are described in Murveit et al\[7,9\], and the 
basic characteristics of the natural anguage understanding 
component are described in Jackson et al \[4\]. Some sub- 
jects used the real-time hardware version of the DECIPHER 
system (Murveit and Weintraub \[8\]; Weintraub et al \[12\]); 
others used the software version of the system, which was a 
modified version of SRI's benchmark system (as described 
in the references above) tuned using the pnming threshold 
to improve speed at the cost of introducing a small number 
of recognition errors. 
SRI's SLS technology was implemented in the air travel 
planning domain, a domain with which many people are 
familiar (see Price \[10\]). The underlying database was a 
relational version of an 11-city subset of the Official Airline 
Guide. Two DARPA/NIST standard microphones were 
used: the Sennheiser HMD-410 close-talking microphone 
and the Crown PCC-160 table-top microphone. Most data 
were collected with two channels; some of the early data 
were collected using only the Sennheiser microphone. 
When both microphones were used, recognition was based 
on the Sennheiser input. 
The interface presented the user with a screen showing a 
large button labeled "Click Here to Talk." A mouse click on 
this button caused the system to capture speech starting a 
half second before the click; the system automatically deter- 
mined when the speaker finished speaking based on silence 
duration set at a threshold of two seconds. The user could 
move to the context of previous questions via mouse clicks. 
Once the speech was processed, the screen displayed the 
recognized string of words, a "paraphrase" of the system's 
understanding of the request, and, where appropriate, a for- 
matted table of data containing the answer to the query. In 
cases where the natural anguage component could not 
arrive at a reasonable answer, a message window appeared 
displaying one of a small number of error messages. A log 
file was automatically created, containing time-stamps 
marking each action by the user and by the system. 
2.4. Procedure 
Subjects were seated in a quiet room in front of a color 
monitor, and had use of a mouse and microphone(s) but no 
keyboard. They were given a short demonstration how to 
use the system. Some of the subjects were given additional 
instructions explaining that, while they might have a ten- 
dency to enunciate more clearly in the face of recognition 
errors, they should try to speak naturally, since the system 
was not trained on overenunciated or separated speech. 
Once subjects were comfortable with the system, they were 
left alone in the room while they solved travel planning sce- 
narios. After they finished as many scenarios as possible 
within an hour, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire 
and were given a choice of gift certificate for use at a local 
bookstore or a contribution to a charitable institution.

3. EXPERIMENTS 
3.1. The Effects of Speed and Accuracy Trade- 
offs on User Satisfaction 
Since in general, speech understanding systems can trade 
accuracy for speed, we first assessed how these parameters 
might affect user behavior and acceptance of the system. 
The software version of the recognizer was slower than the 
hardware version (2.5 compared to 0.42 times the utterance 
duration), but was substantially more accurate (with a word 
error rate of 16.1% as compared with 24.8% on the same 
sound files).

1. Were the answers provided quickly enough? 
2. Did the system understand your requests the first time? 
3. I focused most of my attention on solving the problems, 
rather than trying to make the system understand me. 
4. Do you think a person unfamiliar with computers could 
use the system easily? 
5. Would you prefer this method to looking up the informa- 
tion in a book? 
Figure 1: User Satisfaction 
To assess user satisfaction, we compared questionnaire 
responses for 46 subjects who used the hardware, 23 who 
used the software, and 46 who used the earlier wizard- 
mediated system. Mean responses are shown in Figure 1. In 
general, user satisfaction with the speed of the system cor- 
related with the response time of the system they used; 
when asked, "Were the answers provided quickly enough?" 
69.6% of the hardware users responded "Yes." In contrast, 
only 34.8% of the software users and a mere 11.1% of the 
wizard-system users gave "Yes" responses, a significant dif- 
ference from the hardware result, ~2 (df=4) = 35.6, p < .001. 
Although ardware users were pleased with the speed of the 
system; they were less likely than wizard system and soft- 
ware users to say they focused their attention on solving the 
problem rather than on trying to make the system under- 
stand them (33.3% as compared with 61.4% and 56.5%, 
respectively), a marginally significant effect, ~2 (df=4) = 
7.8, p <.10. 
On several other measures users found the wizard-based 
system preferable to either the software or the hardware. 
More wizard-system users said that the system usually 
understood them the first time (47.8% as compared with 
13.0% and 8.7% for the software and hardware users, 
respectively), ~2(df=4) =22.5, p < .001. Overall, the wizard 
system users were more likely to say the system could be 
easily used by a person who was unfamiliar with computers 
(78% compared with 43.5% and 35.6% for the software and 
hardware, respectively) Z2 (df=4) = 20.5, p < .001. How- 
ever, in terms of general satisfaction, as expressed in 
whether the subjects aid they would prefer using the sys- 
tem to looking the information up in a book, there was no 
significant difference between the groups, with 52.3%, 
60.9% and 55.6% "Yes" answers for the three groups 
respectively. 
Because the hardware system was least satisfying to users 
in terms of recognition accuracy, we concluded that the 
hardware would provide the greatest potential for user adap- 
tation to the system. For this reason, we used the hardware 
system to collect data on the effects of user experience and 
instructions regarding hyperarticulation. 
3.2. Effect of User Experience on Recognition 
User experience was evaluated in a within-subjects design, 
counterbalanced forscenario, that compared 24 users' first 
and second sessions. As a global measure of adaptation, we 
looked at how long it took subjects to complete their two 
scenarios. Although subjects were not told to solve the sce- 
narios as quickly as possible, they nevertheless took less 
time (10.5 compared to 13.0 minutes) to complete their sec- 
ond scenarios, F(1,23) = 5.78, p < .05. This difference was 
partially but not completely attributable toa lower number 
of total utterances in the second scenario. 
The users also elicited fewer recognition errors in the sec- 
ond scenario. The mean word error rate was 20.4% for the 
first scenario but fell to 16.1% for the second, F(1,22) = 
5.60, p < .05. However, not all users decreased their recog- 
nition error rate. There was a significant interaction between 
initial error rate and change in error rate from the first sce- 
nario to the second, F(1,22) = 10.98, p < .01. Subjects who 
had recognition error rates of 20% or worse in the first sce- 
nario (N=I 1) tended to improve recognition performance, 
while subjects who had better initial performance (N=13) 
did not (Figure 2). Subjects with initial error rates of 20% or 
51 
higher went from an average of 31.3% errors down to 
19.6%, while subjects with initially lower error rates 
showed no statistically significant change. For those sub- 
jects who did improve recognition performance, the 
improvement could only be due to user adaptation, since 
the same SLS version was used for both scenarios.

Figure 2: Recognition accuracy over time. 
The improvement in recognition may be due in part to user 
adaptation to the language models used. As a measure of 
deviation from the system's language models, we used test- 
set perplexity, which was based on the bigram probabilities 
of the observed word sequences. As would be expected, 
there was a significant, positive average correlation 
between utterance word error and perplexity: mean r = .28, 
t = 4.55, p < .001. Thus, one way for subjects to improve 
recognition accuracy would be to change their language to 
conform to that of the system model. Perplexity may there- 
fore play a role in the decrease in recognition error rates 
observed over time for those subjects who had an error rate 
of 20% or worse in their first scenario. For this group of 
subjects, there was a tendency to produce queries with 
lower sentence perplexity in the second scenario (Figure 3). 
Using the median as a measure of central tendency (a more 
stable measure due to the inherent positive skew of perplex- 
ity), we found that the average median sentence perplexity 
was 25.3 for the first scenario and 19.4 for the second, a 
reliable difference, F(1,10) = 7.44, p < .05.

In addition to decreasing perplexity, subjects who had initial 
error rates of greater than 20% also tended to decrease the 
use of out-of-vocabulary words in the second scenario, 
whereas ubjects who had lower error rates did not, a signif- 
icant interaction, F(1,22) = 6.10, p < .05. Overall, however, 
the use of out-of-vocabulary words was rare. 
These findings indicate that at least o some degree, subjects 
adapted to the language models of the system and, in doing 
so, managed to improve the recognizer's performance. 
Quite possibly, subjects were finding ways to phrase their 
queries that produced successful answers, and then repro- 
ducing these phrases in subsequent queries. In future work, 
further analyses (for example, looking at dialogue) will 
address this issue in greater detail. 
3.3. Effect of Instructions on Speech Style 
Another potential source of recognition errors arises when 
the speech of the user deviates from the acoustic models of 
the system. Since the vast majority of the data used to train 
the DECIPHER recognizer came from wizard-mediated 
data collection \[6\], where recognition performance was 
nearly perfect, examples of "frustrated" speech were rare. In 
human-human i teraction, when an addressee (such as a 
foreigner) has difficulty understanding, speakers change 
their speech style to enunciate more clearly than usual (Fer- 
guson \[3\]). We suspected that a similar effect might occur 
for people speaking to a machine that displayed feedback 
showing less than perfect understanding. We noticed that, 
when using an SLS as opposed to a wizard-mediated sys- 
tem, subjects tended to hyperarticulate: releasing stops, 
emphasizing initial word segments, pausing between words, 
and increasing vocal effort. 
52 
Although hyperarticulation is a multifaceted behavior, it 
was nevertheless possible to make global judgments about 
individual utterances. Hyperarticulation was coded for each 
utterance on a three-point scale by listening to the utter- 
ances. Utterances were coded as (1) clearly natural sound- 
ing, (2) strongly hyperarticulated, or (3) somewhat 
hyperarticulated. The coding was done blindly without ref- 
erence to session context or system performance. 
Using a within-subjects design, so that any differences in 
recognition performance ould be attributed to a change in 
speech style, rather than speaker effects, we analyzed the 
speech style of 24 subjects' first scenarios (future analyses 
will also examine repeat scenarios). These subjects (of 
whom 20 were also included in the previous analysis of 
user experience) all used the hardware system. The subjects 
averaged about 10 natural sounding, 4 somewhat hyperar- 
ticulate, and 5 strongly hyperarticulate utterances ach. For 
the 13 subjects who had at least three natural and three 
strongly hyperarticulated utterances, we compared recogni- 
tion performance within subjects and found that the 
strongly hyperarticulate utterances resulted in higher word 
error rates, F(1,12) = 5.19, p < .05. 
Hyperarticulation was reduced, however, by giving users 
instructions not to "overenunciate" and by explaining that 
the system was trained on "normal" speech. We calculated a 
hyperarticulation score for each subject by weighting 
"strongly hyperarticulated" utterances as 1, "somewhat 
hyperarticulated" utterances as 0.5, and "nonhyperarticu- 
lated" utterances a  0, and taking the mean weight across all 
utterances in the scenario. The 12 subjects who heard the 
instructions (the "instruction group") had lower mean 
hyperarticulation scores, 0.22 as compared with 0.60 for the 
12 subjects who received no special instructions (the "no 
instruction group"), asignificant difference F(1,22) = 11.97, 
p < .01. 
Given that the instruction group had significantly fewer 
hyperarticulated utterances, and given that hyperarticula- 
tion is associated with lower recognition accuracy, we 
would expect he instruction group to have better ecogni- 
tion performance overall. However, although the trend was 
in that direction (18.1% word error for the instruction group 
versus 22.5% for the no-instruction group.), the difference 
was not reliable. One possible explanation is a lack of 
power in the analysis, as a result of the small number of 
subjects and large individual differences in error rates. A 
second, not necessarily conflicting explanation is that the 
subjects given the instructions to "speak naturally" used 
somewhat less planned and less formal speech. We noticed 
that these subjects tended to have more spontaneous speech 
effects, such as verbal deletions, word fragments, lengthen- 
ings and filled pauses. Overall, spontaneous speech effects 
occurred in 15% of the 232 utterances for the instruction 
group, compared with 10% for the 229 utterances for the 
no-instruction group. Although these baseline rates are low, 
they may nevertheless have contnbuted topoorer ecogni- 
tion rates (see Butzberger et al \[2\]). They may also be 
indicative of subtle speech style differences between the 
two groups not captured by the coding of hyperarticulation. 
4. CONCLUSION 
Application development can benefit from analyses of fac- 
tors affecting system performance and user satisfaction. We 
have presented examples of ways in which the behavior and 
satisfaction of subjects interacting with an SLS may be 
affected. We have described ways in which parameters of 
the system itself, such as speed and accuracy, affect differ- 
ent aspects of user satisfaction. We have examined the 
effect of user experience on recognition performance and 
found a decrease inword error rate over repeated scenarios. 
Adaptation was relatively greater for those subjects who 
had more than 20% errors on the first scenario. The 
decrease in errors could be attributed at least in part to a 
decrease in sentence perplexity and to a reduction in the use 
of out-of-vocabulary words. We have also shown a signifi- 
cant relationship between word error rates and hyperarticu- 
lation, a speech style that occurs relatively frequently with 
an imperfect recognizer. We have shown that instructions 
not to hyperarticulate r duced this maladaptive speech 
style, but that instructions did not result in improved recog- 
nition performance overall. 
Our studies have shown that along some dimensions, 
humans are flexible and can adapt in ways that improve sys- 
tem performance. However, hyperarticulation may be a 
maladaptive behavior for which a technological solution 
should be investigated. In particular we have found that 
strategies people use to try to improve normal human com- 
munication (e.g., hyperarticulation) can have the reverse 
effect in the context of our current models. While hyperar- 
ticulation is an "exaggerated" speech style that might 
improve comprehension for humans, it can cause poor rec- 
ognition for automatic systems in which "exaggeration" is 
not adequately modeled.
