The Jachine realization of the periphrasing system 
and the results of the experiment. 
E.G. Arsentyeva (Moscow) 
The paper is devoted to the machine realization of the 
periphrasing system devised by I.A. Mel'chuk and A.K. Geolcovsky 
According to the idea of the semantic nature of a synthesis a 
deep sentence structure is used am input data for the periphra- 
sing sjstem. By the given rules which are mashing up as a matter 
of fact the periphrasing ~ystem the other sentence deep struc- 
tures are obtained from the given deep structure, being equiva- 
lent by meaning. Both the machine realization of the periphrasin 
~ystem and the experiment carried out wre~ intended to verify 
and to check out both the periphrasing system and the realizati- 
on programs. Further the specified versinn of the periphrasing 
system is supposed to be included in a general system of a Russi 
an semantic synthesis used for the machine translation. 
The notions used in the periphrasing system are shortly 
described. The detailed description of the semantic and syntac- 
ti~ rules is given. A paragrapher is devoted the detailed descri 
ption of the machine dictionary ( s. the paper of I.A?Mel'chuk 
and J. D. Apresyan). The algorithm periphrasing is given. 
The work of the algorithm is illustrated by some examples.
