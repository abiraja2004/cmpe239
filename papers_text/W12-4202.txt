Abstract
In this paper, we present our linguistically-
enriched Bulgarian-to-English statistical ma-
chine translation model, which takes a sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) system as
backbone various linguistic features as fac-
tors. The motivation is to take advantages of
both the robustness of the SMT system and
the rich linguistic knowledge from morpho-
logical analysis as well as the hand-crafted
grammar resources. The automatic evaluation
has shown promising results and our extensive
manual analysis confirms the high quality of
the translation the system delivers. The whole
framework is also extensible for incorporating
information provided by different sources.
1 Introduction
Incorporating linguistic knowledge into statistical
models is an everlasting topic in natural language
processing. The same story happens in the ma-
chine translation community. Along with the suc-
cess of statistical machine translation (SMT) models
(summarized by Koehn (2010)), various approaches
have been proposed to include linguistic informa-
tion, ranging from early work by Wu (1997) to re-
cent work by Chiang (2010), from deep transfer-
based models (Graham and van Genabith, 2008) to
mapping rules at the syntactic level (Galley et al,
2004; Liu et al, 2006; Zhang et al, 2008). Although
the purely data-driven approaches achieve signifi-
cant results as shown in the evaluation campaigns
(Callison-Burch et al, 2011), according to the hu-
man evaluation, the final outputs of the SMT sys-
tems are still far from satisfactory.
Koehn and Hoang (2007) proposed a factored
SMT model as an extension of the traditional
phrase-based SMT model, which opens up an easy
way to incorporate linguistic knowledge at the to-
ken level. Birch et al (2007) and Hassan et al
(2007) have shown the effectiveness of adding su-
pertags on the target side, and Avramidis and Koehn
(2008) have focused on the source side, translat-
ing a morphologically-poor language (English) to a
morphologically-rich language (Greek). However,
all of them attempt to enrich the English part of
the language pairs being translated. For the lan-
guage pairs like Bulgarian-English, there has not
been much study on it, mainly due to the lack of
resources, including corpora, preprocessors, etc, on
the Bulgarian part. There was a system published
by Koehn et al (2009), which was trained and tested
on the European Union law data, but not on other
popular domains like news. They reported a very
high BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) on the
Bulgarian-English translation direction (61.3).
Apart from being morphologically-rich, Bulgar-
ian has a number of challenging linguistic phenom-
ena to consider, including free word order, long dis-
tance dependency, coreference relations, clitic dou-
bling, etc. For instance, the following two sentences:
(1) Momcheto
Boy-the
j
her-dat
go
it-acc
dava
gives
buketa
bouquet-the
na
to
momicheto.
girl-the.
The boy gives the bouquet to the girl.
(2) Momcheto
Boy-the
j
her-dat
go
it-acc
dava.
gives.
The boy gives it to her.
10
are difficult for the traditional phrase-based SMT
system, because the clitic in the first sentence must
not be translated, while in the second case it is oblig-
atory. Via the semantic analysis (e.g., Minimal Re-
cursion Semantics), the clitic information will be in-
corporated in the representation of the correspond-
ing arguments.
In this work, we rely on the linguistic processing
to cope with some of these phenomena and improve
the correspondences between the two languages: 1)
The lemmatization factors out the difference be-
tween word forms and ensures better coverage of the
Bulgarian-English lexicon. 2) The dependency pars-
ing helps to identify the grammatical functions such
as subject, object in sentences with a non-standard
word order. 3) The semantic analysis provides a fur-
ther abstraction which hides some of the language
specific features. Example of the last is the case of
clitic doubling.
As for the Bulgarian-to-English translation
model, we basically ?annotate? the SMT baseline
with various linguistic features derived from the
preprocessing and hand-crafted grammars. There
are three contributions of this work:
? The models trained on a decent amount of par-
allel corpora output surprisingly good results,
in terms of automatic evaluation metrics.
? The enriched models give us more space for ex-
perimenting with different linguistic features
without losing the ?basic? robustness.
? According to our extensive manual analyses,
the approach has shown promising results for
future integration of more knowledge from the
continued advances of the deep grammars.
The rest of the paper will be organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 briefly introduces some background
of the hand-crafted grammar resources we use and
also some previous related work on transfer-based
MT. Section 3 describes the linguistic analyses we
perform on the Bulgarian text, whose output is used
in the factored SMT model. We show our exper-
iments in Section 4 as well as both automatic and
detailed manual evaluation of the results. We sum-
marize this paper in Section 5 and point out several
directions for future work.
2 Machine Translation with Deep
Grammars
Our work is also enlightened by another line of re-
search, transfer-based MT models using deep lin-
guistic knowledge, which are seemingly different
but actually very related. In this section, before
we describe our model of incorporating linguis-
tic knowledge from the hand-crafted grammars, we
firstly introduce the background of such resources as
well as some previous work on MT using them.
Our usage of Minimal Recursion Semantic
(MRS) analysis of Bulgarian text is inspired by the
work on MRS and RMRS (Robust Minimal Recur-
sion Semantic) (see (Copestake, 2003) and (Copes-
take, 2007)) and the previous work on transfer of de-
pendency analyses into RMRS structures described
in (Spreyer and Frank, 2005) and (Jakob et al,
2010). Although being a semantic representation,
MRS is still quite close to the syntactic level, which
is not fully language independent. This requires a
transfer at the MRS level, if we want to do trans-
lation from the source language to the target lan-
guage. The transfer is usually implemented in the
form of rewriting rules. For instance, in the Nor-
wegian LOGON project (Oepen et al, 2004), the
transfer rules were hand-written (Bond et al, 2005;
Oepen et al, 2007), which included a large amount
of manual work. Graham and van Genabith (2008)
and Graham et al (2009) explored the automatic rule
induction approach in a transfer-based MT setting
involving two lexical functional grammars (LFGs)1,
which was still restricted by the performance of both
the parser and the generator. Lack of robustness for
target side generation is one of the main issues, when
various ill-formed or fragmented structures come
out after transfer. Oepen et al (2007) used their
generator to generate text fragments instead of full
sentences, in order to increase the robustness.
In our approach, we want to make use of the
grammar resources while keeping the robustness,
therefore, we experiment with another way of trans-
fer involving information derived from the gram-
mars. In particular, we take a robust SMT system
as our ?backbone? and then we augment it with deep
linguistic knowledge. In general, what we are doing
1Although their grammars are automatically induced from
treebanks, the formalism supports rich linguistic information.
11
is still along the lines of previous work utilizing deep
grammars, but we build a more ?light-weighted? but
yet extensible statistical transfer model.
3 Factor-based SMT Model
Our translation model is built on top of the factored
SMT model proposed by Koehn and Hoang (2007),
as an extension of the traditional phrase-based SMT
framework. Instead of using only the word form
of the text, it allows the system to take a vector of
factors to represent each token, both for the source
and target languages. The vector of factors can be
used for different levels of linguistic annotations,
like lemma, part-of-speech, or other linguistic fea-
tures, if they can be (somehow) represented as an-
notations to each token.
The process is quite similar to supertagging (Ban-
galore and Joshi, 1999), which assigns ?rich descrip-
tions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in
a local context?. In our case, all the linguistic fea-
tures (factors) associated with each token form a
supertag to that token. Singh and Bandyopadhyay
(2010) had a similar idea of incorporating linguis-
tic features, while they worked on Manipuri-English
bidirectional translation. Our approach is slightly
different from (Birch et al, 2007) and (Hassan et al,
2007), who mainly used the supertags on the target
language side, English. Instead, we primarily ex-
periment with the source language side, Bulgarian.
This potentially huge feature space provides us with
various possibilities of using our linguistic resources
developed within and out of our project.
Firstly, the data was processed by the NLP pipe
for Bulgarian (Savkov et al, 2012) including a mor-
phological tagger, GTagger (Georgiev et al, 2012), a
lemmatizer and a dependency parser2. Then we con-
sider the following factors on the source language
side (Bulgarian):
? WF ? word form is just the original text token.
? LEMMA is the lexical invariant of the original word
form. We use the lemmatizer, which operates on
the output from the POS tagging. Thus, the 3rd per-
son, plural, imperfect tense verb form ?varvyaha?
(?walking-were?, They were walking) is lemmatized
as the 1st person, present tense verb ?varvya?.
2We have trained the MaltParser3 (Nivre et al, 2007)
on the dependency version of BulTreeBank: http://www.
bultreebank.org/dpbtb/. The trained model achieves
85.6% labeled parsing accuracy.
? POS ? part-of-speech of the word. We use the po-
sitional POS tag set of the BulTreeBank, where the
first letter of the tag indicates the POS itself, while
the next letters refer to semantic and/or morphosyn-
tactic features, such as: Dm - where ?D? stands for
?adverb?, and ?m? stand for ?modal?; Ncmsi - where
?N? stand for ?noun?, ?c? means ?common?, ?m? is
?masculine?, ?s? is ?singular?,and ?i? is ?indefinite?.
? LING ? other linguistic features derived from the
POS tag in the BulTreeBank tagset.
? DEPREL is the dependency relation between the
current word and the parent node.
? HLEMMA is the lemma of the parent node.
? HPOS is the POS tag of the parent node.
Here is an example of a processed sentence. The
sentence is ?spored odita v elektricheskite kompanii
politicite zloupotrebyavat s dyrzhavnite predpriy-
atiya.? The glosses for the words in the Bulgarian
sentence are: spored (according) odita (audit-the) v
(in) elektricheskite (electrical-the) kompanii (com-
panies) politicite (politicians-the) zloupotrebyavat
(abuse) s (with) dyrzhavnite (state-the) predpriy-
atiya (enterprises). The translation in the original
source is : ?electricity audits prove politicians abus-
ing public companies.? The result from the linguistic
processing are presented in Table 1.
As for the deep linguistic knowledge, we also ex-
tract features from the semantic analysis ? Minimal
Recursion Semantics (MRS). MRS is introduced as
an underspecified semantic formalism (Copestake et
al., 2005). It is used to support semantic analyses
in the English HPSG grammar ERG (Copestake and
Flickinger, 2000), but also in other grammar for-
malisms like LFG. The main idea is that the for-
malism avoids spelling out the complete set of read-
ings resulting from the interaction of scope bearing
operators and quantifiers, instead providing a single
underspecified representation from which the com-
plete set of readings can be constructed. Here we
will present only basic definitions from (Copestake
et al, 2005). For more details the cited publication
should be consulted.
An MRS structure is a tuple ? GT , R, C ?, where
GT is the top handle, R is a bag of EPs (ele-
mentary predicates) and C is a bag of handle con-
straints, such that there is no handle h that outscopes
GT . Each elementary predicate contains exactly
four components: 1) a handle which is the label of

the EP; 2) a relation; 3) a list of zero or more or-
dinary variable arguments of the relation; and 4) a
list of zero or more handles corresponding to scopal
arguments of the relation (i.e., holes).
Robust MRS (RMRS) is introduced as a modifica-
tion of MRS which captures the semantics resulting
from the shallow analysis. Here the following as-
sumption is taken into account: the shallow proces-
sor does not have access to a lexicon. Thus it does
not have access to the arity of the relations in EPs.
Therefore, the representation has to be underspeci-
fied with respect to the number of arguments of the
relations. The names of relations are constructed on
the basis of the lemma for each wordform in the text
and the main argument for the relation is specified.
This main argument could be of two types: referen-
tial index for nouns and event for the other parts of
speech. Because in this work we are using only the
RMRS relation and the type of the main argument as
features to the translation model, we will skip here
the explanation of the full RMRS structures and how
they are constructed.
As for the factors, we firstly do a match between
the surface tokens and the MRS elementary predi-
cates (EPs) and then extract the following features
as extra factors:
? EP ? the name of the elementary predicate, which
usually indicates an event or an entity semantically.
? EOV indicates the current EP is either an event or a
reference variable.
? ARGnEP indicates the elementary predicate of the
argument which belongs to the predicate. n is usu-
ally from 1 to 3.
? ARGnPOS indicates the POS tag of the argument
which belongs to the predicate.
Notice that we do not take all the information pro-
vided by the MRS, e.g., we throw away the scopal
information and the other arguments of the relations.
Those kinds of information is not straightforward to
be represented in such ?tagging?-style models, which
will be tackled in the future.
The extra information for the example sentence
is represented in Table 2. All these factors encoded
13
within the corpus provide us with a rich selection of
features for different experiments.
4 Experiments
To run the experiments, we use the phrase-based
translation model provided by the open-source sta-
tistical machine translation system, Moses4 (Koehn
et al, 2007). For training the translation model,
the SETIMES parallel corpus has been used, which
is part of the OPUS parallel corpus5. As for the
choice of the datasets, the language is more diverse
in the news articles, compared with other corpora in
more controlled settings, e.g., the JRC-Acquis cor-
pus6 used by Koehn et al (2009).
We split the corpus into the training set and the
test set by 150,000 and 1,000 sentence pairs re-
spectively7. Both datasets are preprocessed with
the tokenizer and lowercase converter provided by
Moses. Then the procedure is quite standard: We
run GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for bi-directional
word alignment, and then obtain the lexical trans-
lation table and phrase table. A tri-gram language
model is estimated using the SRILM toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002). For the rest of the parameters we use the
default setting provided by Moses.
Notice that, since on the target language side (i.e.,
English) we do not have any other factors than the
word form, the factor-based models we use here
only differentiate from each other in the translation
phase, i.e., there is no ?generation? models involved.
4.1 Automatic Evaluation Metrics
The baseline results (non-factored model) under the
standard evaluation metrics are shown in the first
row of Table 3 in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al,
2002) and METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011).
We then design various configurations to test the
effectiveness of different linguistic annotations de-
scribed in Section 3. The detailed configurations we
considered are shown in the first column of Table 3.
The first impression is that the BLEU scores in
general are high. These models can be roughly

putationally heavy for such various configurations.
grouped into six categories (separated by double
lines): word form with linguistic features; lemma
with linguistic features; models with dependency
features; MRS elementary predicates (EP) and the
type of the main argument of the predicate (EOV);
EP features without word forms; and EP features
with MRS ARGn features.
In terms of the resulting scores, POS and Lemma
seem to be effective features, as Model 2 has the
highest BLEU score and Model 4 the best METEOR
score. Model 3 indicates that linguistic features also
improve the performance. Model 4-6 show the ne-
cessity of including the word form as one of the
factors. Incorporating HLEMMA feature largely de-
creases the results due to the vastly increasing vo-
cabulary, i.e., aligning and translating bi-grams in-
stead of tokens. Therefore, we did not include the
results in the table. After replacing the HLEMMA
with HPOS, the result is close to the others (Model
8). Model 9 may also indicate that increasing the
number of factors does not guarantee performance
enhancement. The experiments with predicate fea-
tures (EP and EOV) from the MRS analyses (Model
10-12) show improvements over the baseline con-
sistently and using only the MRS features (Model
13-14) also delivers descent results. Concerning
the MRS ARGn features, the models with ARGnEP
again suffer from the sparseness problem as the de-
pendency HLEMMA features, but the models with
ARGnPOS (Model 15-16) achieve better perfor-
mance than those with dependency HPOS features.
This is mainly because the dependency information
is encoded together with the (syntactically) depen-
dent word, while the MRS arguments are grouped
around the semantic heads.
So far, incorporating additional linguistic knowl-
edge has not shown huge improvement in terms of
statistical evaluation metrics. However, this does not
mean that the translations delivered are the same. In
order to fully evaluate the system, manual analysis is
absolutely necessary. We are still far from drawing a
conclusion at this point, but the automatic evaluation
scores already indicate that the system can deliver
decent translation quality consistently.

aspects of the quality of the translation: Grammati-
cality and Content. Grammaticality can be evaluated
solely on the system output and Content by compar-
ison with the reference translation. We use a 1-5
score for each aspect as follows:
Grammaticality
1. The translation is not understandable.
2. The evaluator can somehow guess the meaning, but
cannot fully understand the whole text.
3. The translation is understandable, but with some ef-
forts.
4. The translation is quite fluent with some minor mis-
takes or re-ordering of the words.
5. The translation is perfectly readable and grammati-
cal.
Content
1. The translation is totally different from the refer-
ence.
2. About 20% of the content is translated, missing the
major content/topic.
3. About 50% of the content is translated, with some
missing parts.
4. About 80% of the content is translated, missing only
minor things.
5. All the content is translated.
For the missing lexicons or not-translated Cyril-
lic tokens, we ask the evaluators to score 2 for one
Cyrillic token and score 1 for more than one tokens
in the output translation. We have two annotators
achieving the inter-annotator agreement according
to Cohen?s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) ? = 0.73 for gram-
maticality and ? = 0.75 for content, both of which
are substantial agreement. For the conflict cases,
we take the average value of both annotators and
rounded the final score up or down in order to have
an integer.
The current results from the manual validation
are on the basis of randomly sampled 150 sentence
pairs. The numbers shown in Table 4 are the number
of sentences given the corresponding scores. The
?Sum? column shows the average score of all the out-
put sentences by each model and the ?Final? column
shows the average of the two ?Sum? scores.
The results show that linguistic and semantic
analyses definitely improve the quality of the trans-
lation. Exploiting the linguistic processing on
word level ? LEMMA, POS and LING ? pro-
duces the best result. However, the model with
only EP and EOV features also delivers very good
results, which indicates the effectiveness of the
MRS features from the deep hand-crafted gram-
mars, although incorporating the MRS ARGn fea-
tures shows similar performance drops as depen-
dency features. Including more factors in general
reduces the results because of the sparseness effect
over the dataset, which is consistent with the au-
tomatic evaluation. The last two rows are shown

their training data. In future we plan to do the same
evaluation with a larger dataset.
Concerning the impact from the linguistic pro-
cessing pipeline to the final translation results,
Lemma and MRS elementary predicates help at the
level of rich morphology. For example, the baseline
model correctly translates the adjective ?Egyptian?
in ?Egyptian Scientists? (plural), but not in ?Egyp-
tian Government, as in the second phrase the adjec-
tive has a neutral gender. Model 4 and Model 13 are
correct for both.
Generally speaking, if we roughly divide the lin-
guistic processing pipeline in two categories: statis-
tical processing (POS tagger and dependency parser)
and rule-based processing (lemmatizer and MRS
construction), the latter category (almost perfect)
highly relies on the former one. For example, the
lemma depends on the word form and the tag, and
the result is unambiguous in more than 98% of the
morphological lexicon and in text this is almost
100% (because the ambiguous cases are very rare).
The errors come mainly from new words and errors
in the tagger. Similarly, the RMRS rules are good
when the parser is correct. Here, the main problems
are duplications of the ROOT elements and the sub-
ject elements, which we plan to fix using heuristics
in the future.
4.3 Question-Based Evaluation
Although the reported manual evaluation in the pre-
vious section demonstrates that linguistic knowl-
edge improves the translation, we notice that the
evaluators tend to give marks at the two ends of
scale, and less in the middle. Generally, this is
because the measurement is done on the basis of
the content that the evaluators extract from the Bul-
garian sentence using there own cognitive capacity.
Then they start to overestimate or underestimate the
translation, knowing in advance what has to be trans-
lated. In order to avoid this subjectivity, we design
a different manual evaluation in which the evalua-
tor does not know the original Bulgarian sentences.
Then the evaluation is based only on the content rep-
resented within the English translation.
In order to do this, we represent the content of the
Bulgarian sentences as a set of questions that have
a list of possible answers, assigned to them. During
the judgement of the content transfer, the evaluators
16
need to answer these questions. As the list of an-
swers also contains false answers, the evaluators are
forced to select the right answer which can be in-
ferred from the English translation.
The actual questions are created semi-
automatically from the dependency analysis of
the sentences. We defined a set of rules for genera-
tion of the questions on the basis of the dependency
relations. For example, if a sentence has only a
subject relation presented within the analysis, the
question will be about who is doing the event. If
the analysis presents subject and direct object, the
question will be about who is doing something with
what/whom. These automatically generated ques-
tions are manually investigated and, if necessary,
edited. Also, additional answers are formulated on
the basis of general language knowledge. The main
idea is that the possible answers are conceptually
close to each other, but not in a hypernymy relation.
Always there is an answer ?none?.
Then the questions are divided into small groups
and distributed to be answered by three evaluators
in such a way that each question is answered by two
evaluators, but no evaluator answers the whole set of
questions for a given sentence. In this way, we try
to minimize the influence of one question to the an-
swers of the next questions. The answers are com-
pared to the true answers of the questions for each
given sentence. We evaluated 192 questions for each
model and sum up the scores (correctly answered
questions) in Table 5.
This evaluation is more expensive, but we expect
them to be more objective. As for a related work,
(Yuret et al, 2010) used textual entailment to eval-
uate different parser outputs. The way they con-
structed the hypotheses is similar to our creation of
questions (based on dependency relations). How-
ever, they focused on the automatic evaluation and
we adopt it for the manual evaluation.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we report our work on building a
linguistically-enriched statistical machine transla-
tion model from Bulgarian to English. Based on our
observations of the previous approaches on transfer-
based MT models, we decide to build a factored
model by feeding an SMT system with deep lin-

guistic features. We perform various experiments on
several configurations of the system (with different
linguistic knowledge). The high BLEU score shows
the high quality of the translation delivered by the
SMT baseline; and various manual analyses confirm
the consistency of the system.
There are various aspects of the current approach
we can improve: 1) The MRSes are not fully ex-
plored yet, although we have considered the most
important predicate and argument features. 2) We
would like to add factors on the target language side
(English) as well to fulfill a ?complete? transfer. 3)
Incorporating reordering rules on the Bulgarian side
may help the alignment and larger language mod-
els on the English side should also help improving
the translation results. 4) Due to the morphologi-
cal complexity of the Bulgarian language, the other
translation direction, from Bulgarian to English, is
also worth investigation in this framework.
