Abstract
This paper presents a corpus targeting eval-
uative meaning as it pertains to descriptions
of events. The corpus, POLITICAL-ADS is
drawn from 141 television ads from the 2008
U.S. presidential race and contains 3945 NPs
and 1549 VPs annotated for scalar sentiment
from three different perspectives: the narra-
tor, the annotator, and general society. We
show that annotators can distinguish these per-
spectives reliably and that correlation between
the annotator?s own perspective and that of a
generic individual is higher than those with
the narrator. Finally, as a sample application,
we demonstrate that a simple compositional
model built off of lexical resources outper-
forms a lexical baseline.
1 Introduction
In the past decade, the semantics of evaluative lan-
guage has received renewed attention in both formal
and computational linguistics (Martin and White,
2005; Potts, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2008; Jackend-
off, 2007). This work has focused on evaluativity
at either the lexical level or the phrasal/event level
stance, without bridging between the two. A par-
allel tradition of compositional event polarity ((Na-
sukawa and Yi, 2003; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007;
Choi and Cardie, 2008; Neviarouskaya et al., 2010))
has grown up analogous to approaches to composi-
tionality in formal semantics: event predicates are
not of constant polarity, but provide functions from
the polarities of their arguments to event polarities.
Little work exists assessing the relative advantages
of a compositional account, in part because no re-
source annotating both NP level polarity and event-
level polarity in context exists. This paper intro-
duces such a corpus, POLITICAL-ADS, a collec-
tion of 2008 U.S. presidential race television ads
with scalar sentiment annotations at the NP and VP
level. After describing the corpus creation and char-
acteristics in sections 3 and 4, in section 5, we show
that a compositional system achieves an accuracy of
84.2%, above a lexical baseline of 65.1%.
2 Background
While many sentiment models handle negation
quasi-compositionally (Pang and Lee, 2008; Polanyi
and Zaenen, 2005), Nasukawa & Yi (Nasukawa and
Yi, 2003) first noted that predicates like prevent
are ?flippers?, conveying that their subject and ob-
ject have opposite polarity ? since trouble is nega-
tive, something that prevents trouble is good. Re-
cent work has expanded that idea into a fully com-
positional system (Moilanen and Pulman, 2007;
Neviarouskaya et al., 2010). Moilanen and Pulman
construct a system of compositional rules that builds
polarityin terms of a hand-built lexicon of predicates
as flippers or preservers. However, this system con-
flates two different assessment perspectives, that of
the Narrator and of some mentioned NP (NP-to-NP
perspective). The latter include psychological pred-
icates such as love and hate, and those of admira-
tion or censure (e.g., admonish, praise). Thus, they
would mark John dislikes scary movies as negative, a
correct NP-to-NP claim, but not necessarily correct
for the Narrator. Recognizing this, Neviarouskaya
et al. (Neviarouskaya et al., 2010) develop a pair of
84
Announcer: In tough times, who will help Michigan?s
auto industry? Barack Obama favors loan guarantees to
help Detroit retool and revitalize. But John McCain re-
fused to support loan guarantees for the auto industry.
Now he?s just paying lip service. Not talking straight.
And McCain voted repeatedly for tax breaks for compa-
nies that ship jobs overseas, selling out American anno-
tators. We just can?t afford more of the same.

  Figure 6: Instruction for completing annotation form.  Our Goals: The purpose of this HIT is to help us document the words people use to persuade others. Overview: We ask you to read transcripts of political ads from the 2008 US presidential campaign (you can watch videos of the ads as well). Then you will answer questions about different highlighted portions of the ad. The questions are designed to determine how different pieces of text contribute to the overall message of the ad. You will answer the same four questions for each highlighted portion: 1. How does the narrator want you to feel about the highlighted expression? 2. How do you to feel about the highlighted expression? 3. In your opinion, how controversial is the highlighted expression in American society? 
Figure 2: POLITICAL-ADS annotation interface
compositional rules over both perspectives. Impor-
tantly, neither of these appr ache have been vali-
dated against a suffici ntly nuanced dataset. M ila-
nen and Pulman test against the SemEval-07 Head-
lines Corpus, which asks annotators to give an over-
all impression of sentiment. This approach allows a
headline such as Outcry in N Korea ?nuclear test?
to be arked negative, even though outcry over
military provocations is arguably good. Similarly,
Neviarouskaya et al. evaluate only against NP-to-
NP data as well. While the MPQA corpus (Wiebe
et al., 2005), which annotates the source of each
sentiment annotation, separates these two sentiment
sources, work trained on it has not (Choi and Cardie,
2008; Moilanen et al., 2010). In addition, existing
annotation schemes are not designed to tease apart
perspectival differences. For example, MPQA in-
cludes a notion of Narrator-oriented evaluativity, but
it does not include the perspectives of you and the
general public.
3 The corpus
POLITICAL-ADS, is drawn from politics, a rich
and recently evolving domain for evaluativity re-
search that we hypothesized would involve a high
volume of sentiment claims subject to perspecti-
val differences. POLITICAL-ADS is a collec-
tion of 141 television ads that ran during the 2008
U.S. presidential race between Democratic candi-
date Barack Obama and Republican candidate John
McCain. The collection consists of 81 ads from
Democratic side and 60 ads from Republican side.
Figure 1 provides a sample transcript.
Each transcript was parsed using the Stanford
Parser and all NPs and VPs excluding those headed
by auxiliaries were extracted. VP annotations were
assumed to represent phrasal/event-level polarity
and NP ones argument-level polarity. The annota-
tion interface is shown in Figure 2. Annotators were
shown a transcript and a movie clip, and navigated
through the NPs and VPs within the document. At
each point they were asked to rate their response
on a [-1,1] scale for the following four questions
about the highlighted expression: 1) how the nar-
rator wants them to feel; 2) how they feel; 3) how
people in general feel; 4) how controversial the is-
sue is (included to test the whether sense of contro-
versy yields sharper differences between the various
assessment perspectives). Finally, because phrases
were not prefiltered, a ?Doesn?t Make Sense? button
was provided for each question.
206 annotators on Mechanical Turk completed
985 transcripts at $0.40 per transcript; each tran-
script was annotated by an average of 4.8 different
annotators living in the U.S. We then filtered anno-
tators by 200 phrases we deemed relatively uncon-
troversial in 20 randomly selected transcripts. To do
this, we scored each annotator in terms of the ab-
solute difference between their mean response and
the median (each annotator?s scores were first nor-
malized by mean absolute value) in the Narrator
question. We found when we thresholded annota-
tors at a score above 0.5, agreement with our gold
standard was 83.5% and dropped substantially after-
wards. This threshold excluded 74 annotators, leav-
ing 132 high-quality, or HQ, annotators (the full data
is available in the corpus).
The corpus consists of 5494 phrases (1549 VPs
and 3945 NPs) annotated 6.3 times on average, for
a total of 34, 692 annotations (9800 VP and 24892
NP). Each phrase was annotated by at least 3 HQ
annotators (average 3.9 annotators), and such an-
notators contributed 5960 VP and 15238 NP an-
85
notations. Of these, 12.1% HQ NP and 5.4% of
HQ VP responses were marked as ?Doesn?t Make
Sense? (DMS) for the narrator question. In general,
controversy and narrator questions had the highest
and lowest rates of DMS, respectively; NPs showed
higher response rates than VPs; and HQ annotators
had higher rates of button presses.1 In sections 4 and
5, we will ignore the DMS responses.
4 Corpus Findings
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the corpus.
Across the board, the three perspective questions av-
eraged close to 0, and in general HQ annotators are
closer to 0 (non-HQ annotators tended to provide
positive responses). VPs had slightly higher vari-
ance than NPs, at marginal probability (p < .04),
suggesting that VP responses were more extreme
than NP ones. You and Generic assessments are
highly correlated (Pearson?s ? = 0.85), but Narra-
tor is less so (? = .76/.74). All three are weakly
correlated with Controversy (? = .25/.26/.29 for
Narr., You, Gen., respectively). Narrator has the
highest standard deviations for the raw data, but the
lowest for the normed data. In the raw data, many
annotators recognized the narrators intensely parti-
san views and rated accordingly (|x| > 0.8), but
were more tempered when providing their perspec-
tive (|x| ? 0.35), leading to lower ?. This intensity
difference is factored out in normalization, yielding
the opposite pattern.
The response data was collected from our anno-
tators in scalar form, but applications (e.g., evalu-
ative polarity classification) it is the polarity of the
response that matters. Ignoring magnitude, Table 3
shows the polarity breakdown for all HQ phrasal an-
notations. Positive responses are the dominant class
across the board. Neutral responses are less frequent
for Narrator than for the other types. NPs have fewer
negatives and more neutrals than VPs.
Table 2 shows average standard deviations (i.e.,
agreement) by worker, question, and XP type. Note
both that NPs show less variance than VPs and that
non-HQ annotators less than HQ annotators (non-
HQ annotators gave more 0 responses).

5 Comparing lexical and compositional
treatments
While compositional models of event-level evalua-
tivity are logically defensible, the extent to which
these models apply in the wild is an open ques-
tion. Because other compositional lexicons are not
freely available, we used the system described in
(Reschke and Anand, 2011), which induces flippers
and preservers from the MPQA subjectivity lexi-
con and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2005). The
MPQA lexicon is a collection of over 8,000 words
marked for polarity. Our functor lexicon uses the
following heuristic: verbs marked positive in MPQA
are preservers; verbs marked negative are flippers.
For example, dislike has negative MPQA polarity;
therefore, it is marked as a flipper in our lexicon.
This gives us 1249 predicates: 869 flippers and 380
preservers. 329 additional verbs were added from
FrameNet according to their membership in five en-
according to ?w model comparison.

Table 3: Polarity breakdowns for HQ annotations
tailment classes (Reschke and Anand, 2011): verbs
of injury/destruction, lacking, benefit, creation, and
having. 124 frames across these classes were identi-
fied, and then verbs of benefit, creation, and having
(aid, generate, have) were marked as preservers and
the complement set (forget, arrest, lack) as flippers.
As a lexical baseline, the MPQA polarity of each
verb was used ? flippers correspond to baseline neg-
ative events and preservers to positive ones.
A 635 VP test subset of POLITICAL-ADS was
constructed by omitting intransitive VPs and VPs
with non-NP complements. Gold standard labels
were determined from average normed HQ annota-
tor data. This yielded 329 positive, 284 negative,
and 2 neutral events. NPs, determined similarly, di-
vided into 393 positive, 230 negative, and 12 neutral.
Of the 635 VPs in the test set, only 272 (43.5%)
are in our FrameNet/MPQA lexicon and we hence
compare the two systems on this subset. On this
subset, the compositional system has an accuracy of
84.2%, while the lexical baseline has an accuracy
of 65.1%; there were 72 instances where the com-
positional model outperformed the lexical baseline
and 22 where the lexical outperformed the composi-
tional. Typical examples where the compositional
system won involve MPQA negatives like break,
cut, and hate and positives like want and trust. The
lexical model marks VPs like breaks the grip of for-
eign oil and want a massive government as negative
and positive, respectively ? because the NPs in ques-
tion are negative, the answers should be reversed. In
contrast, the lexical model wins on cases like grow
the economy and reform Wall Street correct. These
exemplify a robust pattern in the errors: cases where
the event is marked positive while the NP is marked
negative. In examples like grow Washington, the
idea that grow is a preserver is reasonable. However,
in grow the economy, the negativity of the economy
is arguably measuring the state of some constant en-
tity. While reform is marked positive in MPQA, it
is arguably a reverser; this shows the problems with
our lexicon induction.
At an intuitive level, we expect agent evalu-
ativity to mirror event-level evaluativity because
positive/negative entities tend to commit posi-
tive/negative acts, and this is borne out. For flip-
pers or preservers, the average VP evaluativity is
correlated with the average subject evaluativity. For
flippers the correlation is 0.57; for preservers it is
0.52. Although our model ignored subject evalua-
tivity, we performed a generalized linear regression
with subject and object evaluativity as predictors
and event-level evaluativity as outcome. For flip-
pers the regression coefficients were 0.52 for subject
(p < 4e? 4) and?0.52 for object (p < 1e? 5). For
preservers the coefficients were 0.27 (p < 1e?5) for
subject and 0.93 for object (p < 2e? 7). Thus, sub-
ject polarity is an important factor for flipper events
(e.g., the hero/villain defeated the enemy, but less so
for preservers (e.g. the hero/villain helped the en-
emy.).
6 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented POLITICAL-ADS,
a new resource for investigating the relationships be-
tween NP sentiment and VP sentiment systemati-
cally. We have demonstrated that annotators can re-
liably annotate political data with sentiment at the
phrasal level from multiple perspectives. We have
also shown that in the present data set that self-
reporting and judging generic positions are highly
correlated, while correlation with narrators is ap-
preciably weaker, as narrators are seen as more ex-
treme. We have also shown that the controversy of a
phrase does not correlate with annotators? disagree-
ments with the narrator. Finally, as a sample appli-
cation, we demonstrated that a simple compositional
model built off of lexical resources outperforms a
purely lexical baseline.
