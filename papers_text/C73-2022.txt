MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AS A STEP IN AUTOMATED 
SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF A TEXT 
Introduction. 
The general purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility 
of an almost completely automated syntactic analysis of a given text 
of a known language. This has in itself some theoretical linguistic in- 
terest, and to the extent hat it succeeds, it will save a large amount of 
labour in relation to automated indexing and translation, etc.. 
One step in this analysis is to count the occurrences of all word- 
forms of the text, not for statistical purposes, but for the purpose of 
selecting a list of highly frequent word-forms for which the labour 
of adding syntactic information before the automated analysis is most 
fruitful. 
This list contains some substance words for which the syntactic 
information mainly consists of assigning a word class; this helps the 
automated analysis just because the words are frequent; they appear in 
many periods of the text. 
But mostly the list contains tructural words (prepositions, pronouns, 
adverbs, auxiliary verbs, etc.); without information on the syntactic 
function of these words it is usually impossible to analyse a text at all. 
Another step in the investigation - the one with which this paper 
deals - is the automated utilization of the morphological information 
contained in the text: a search of the implicit information on word 
class and syntactic function which is given by the knowledge that two 
or more word-forms are flexions of a common stem. 
The concept of a lemma. 
As indicated above, a lemma is defined as a group of two or more 
word-forms of the text which morphologically may be flexed forms 
of a common word stem within one of the flexion paradigms included 
270 GUSTAV LE't,INBACH 
in the analysis (most so-called irregular paradigms being excluded as 
too difficult to automate). 
The language in question is Danish, and a list of 25 paradigms and 
paradigm variants for that language is given as Table 1.

The text has been read into a computer, giving each word-form 
an index number the ftrst time it occurred and storing in one file the 
text represented byindex numbers and in another the word-forms. Lem- 
matization was performed on this latter file by reading each word 
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 271 
backwards. If the last letter was one which could form an ending or 
a part of an ending the preceding letter was also searched, etc.. 
All cases of a possible stem and ending have been treated as putative 
stems. To quote the extreme xample, a form XXSTES is treated as 
a putative stem in itself and as derived from the following putative 
stems: XXSTESS (this is the x-modification of Table 1, the double 
consonant only appears before endings containing an e); XXSTS 
(the z-modification); XXST; XXS and XX. The last three all occur 
in common Danish words; the three first do not, but this only means 
that another derivation from the same putative stem does not appear 
unless by a very rare coincidence. 
The putative stems are stored in a list, and each one is compared with 
all preceding until it is revealed as either one of them or a new one. 
It is essential for the practical maintenance of the analysis that the word- 
forms are sorted at least by fLrst letter and the comparison made one 
group at a time; actually the words were ordered nearly alphabeti- 
cally, but no general rule could be devised for stopping the search earlier. 
After the search has been completed, all putative stems which ap- 
pear only once are discarded. Of the rest, only those are conserved 
where at least two endings belong to the same paradigm, that is to 
the same one among the 25 lines of Table 1. Finally, a file of the index 
numbers of all word-forms i loaded with information on every lemma 
that each word-form belongs to and with which ending. If the same 
word-form belongs to more than one lemma, there is a conflict, see 
later. 
The text is a short Western novel of about 41,000 words which 
have been sorted into slightly more than 5,000 word-forms. Of these, 
about 2,950 have been marked as members of lemmas. 
However, this does not mean that useful syntactic information can 
be derived for nearly 60 pct. of the word-forms of the text. Unless 
the lemma is a pure coincidence (homograph), between two unrela- 
ted words apart from some letters which may be flexion endings; this 
is a problem of the same kind as ordinary homography is for any auto- 
mated text analysis), it indicates a semantic bond between its mem- 
bers, but the syntactic information depends on the set of endings con- 
tained in the lemma. 
In the following, lemmas will be divided into three main categories, 
unambiguous, ambiguous and conflicting. So far, a complete analysis 
has been performed on the 323 lemmas formed by words with initial 
letters A-G, including 882 out of 1568 word-forms. 
272 GUSTAV LEUN'BACH 
Unambiguous lemmas. 
A lemma is called unambiguous if the endings of its members de- 
termine unambiguously which of the three word classes, noun, adjective 
and verb, the lemma may belong to. Normally, this also means that 
the endings can only belong to one of the 25 paradigms of Table 1. 
Of the 323 lemmas formed with the initials A-G, 162 are classified 
as unambiguous. 
Nouns account for 79 lemmas. Most of these contain the ending -en, 
the definitite article in singular for nouns of the common gender, 
which does not belong to any adjectival or verbal paradigm; several 
contain the plural definitite article. 
One lemma has 6 members; a computer-aided inspection has re- 
vealed this to be the word "bandit ", a very appropriate word for 
this type of text, several of its forms have high frequency. Two lemmas 
have each 5 members and seven have 4 each, but more than half have 
only 2 members. With only two forms represented, the risk of a chance 
homography is of course high. 
Adjectives account for 14 cases; they nearly all include the compara- 
tive ending -ere or the superlative -st which can be extended with -e or 
-es. A 15th lemma was also by the computer classified as unambiguous- 
ly adjectival, but it contained only two forms with the endings -ste 
and -stes, and as the example above of different borders between puta- 
tive stem and ending shows, either -s- or -st- may belong to the stem. 
(Inspection showed the word actually to be a verb with a stem ending 
in -s.) 
Two of the fourteen lemmas have 4 members each and eight have 3. 
Verbs: 69 lemmas. 22 of these include the ending -o which in almost 
all verbal paradigms has the function of imperative which is unlikely 
to occur so frequently. Instead, the form with zero ending is probably 
in most cases a noun of the same stem, but not represented in any of 
those forms which differ from verbal flexion endings, and thus not 
causing a conflict between two lemmas. 
Two verbal lemmas have 6 members each (both including the du- 
bious imperative), one has 5 and ten have 4 (six of them including the 
zero form, the dubious imperative); almost half have only 2 members. 
If a lemma is by this definition unambiguous, and the set of endings 
contained in it gives no reason to suspect its validity, the syntactic in- 
formation on each word-form is in most cases quite obvious. With 
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 273 
nouns and adjectives, the forms ending in -s are of particular interest; 
they are possessive forms with function of adjectives, but with a pecu- 
liar distribution of articles. In verbs the participles may form composite 
tenses (the present participle almost never) or may function as ad- 
jectives with restricted flexion patterns. 
Ambiguous lemmas. 
These 115 lemmas have none of the forms which are characteristic 
of either of the three word classes; all are short, 13 of them have 3 
members and the rest only 2. 
58 are classified as possibly nouns or verbs, but 37 of these contain 
the zero ending, mostly together with -et which may be either the de- 
finite article of a neuter noun or a past participle, or with -er which 
may be plural or present ense. As the flexion-less form of a noun is 
much more frequent than the imperative of a verb, the large majority 
of these words are certainly nouns. It may be reasonable to classify 
them together with some of the shorter nominal or verbal lemmas as 
"almost unambiguous ". 
Conflicting lemmas. 
The same word-form may be a member of more than one lemma, 
either with the same border between stem and ending or with a diffe- 
rent one. In each of these cases, each lemma is followed through until 
all word-forms interconnected directly or indirectly are summed up, 
and the whole complex is defined as one conflicting lemma. 
There are 46 conflicting lemmas in the part of the vocabulary in- 
vestigated, containing from 3 to 7 members, apart from one of 10 
members which on inspection proved to be a mixture of demonstra- 
tive pronouns. 
Most of the others can be explained either by a noun and a verb 
formed from the same root (occasionally also an adjective) or by homo- 
graphy between two unrelated words, each with some flexed forms 
represented. 
When both one or more of the shorter endings of a paradigm and 
one of the longer endings are present, one may with reasonable cer- 
tainty assess the word class and syntactic function of the longer form, 
18 
274 GUSTAV LEUNBACH 
even if the shorter form may belong to more than one paradigm and 
no inference can be drawn on its word class. 
Danish compared to other languages. 
The same analysis performed on a text in English will be somewhat 
easier in computational work because of the fewer paradigms and fewer 
forms in each, but I expect he yield to be much less. I would expect 
a lot of ambiguous lemmas (noun or verb), containing the zero form 
and the ending -s, some verbal emmas, containing -ed or -ing or both, 
and a few adjectival lemmas with comparative or superlative endings. 
A noun can only be identified by the endings -'s or -s', which I expect 
to be rare in most texts - and which can be found by more mechanical 
means also. Many verbal emmas would be expected to hide a noun 
of the same root. 
On the other hand, applied to a language with richer flexions the 
computational work involved in this analysis might get out of hand, 
and I am not sure that the yield would in all cases increase comparably. 
In German I expect many ambiguous lemmas to be found because 
several endings occur in paradigms of different classes. French has the 
same problem as English that nouns can hardly be identified by their 
endings; moreover the boundary between regular and irregular para- 
digms is rather vague in written French, making it somewhat uncer- 
tain how many paradigms it pays to include in the automated analysis. 
Russian seems to me to offer somewhat better possibilities. There 
are many verbal paradigms with various stem modifications which it 
may be impossible to automate, but the forms of the present tense on 
one hand, and most other forms separately may make it possible to 
identify a verb by two different stems. The risk of finding ambiguous 
lemmas is small, though conflicting lemmas may occur. And the spe- 
cific information on case which many nominal forms contain is often 
relevant to the syntactis analysis, although it may be difficult to utilize 
it in an automated manner. 
S. Hellberg's analysis of Swedish. 
After the computational work for this paper had been completed 
my attention was drawn to an article by S. HELLBV.RC: Computerized 
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 275 
Lemmatization without the Use of a Dictionary, in ~ Computers and the 
Humanities )), VI (1972) 4, pp. 209-212. The following discussion of 
his method is built mainly on a stencilled report in Swedish mentioned 
in a footnote to the article. 
Hellberg does not investigate all possible ways of dividing one 
word-form into stem and ending, but investigates for two word-forms 
at a time whether they can be the same stem with two flexion endings 
within the same paradigm. 
This procedure depends heavily on a complete alphabetization f
all word-forms. In the cases where Swedish as the same stem modi- 
fications that my program takes into account, Hellberg has to define 
the stem as the shortest part of the word which is identical in all flexed 
forms; this increases the number of different endings, and the definition 
of a stem comes rather far from the ordinary grammatical concept, 
while mine corresponds rather closely to it. 
Hellberg's method may be faster than mine in computation time, 
but I believe that he runs a greater isk of missing lemmas which are 
actually present han I; the concept of a conflicting lemma does not 
appear in his system, instead he discusses the frequency of wrong lem- 
mafizations. 
Praaical results. 
Of a vocabulary of slightly above 5,000 word-forms in a novel of 
about 41,000 words, nearly 60 pct have proved to be members of lem- 
mas, that is sets of two or more word-forms which may be flexions 
of the same stem within one of the regular paradigms. 
An inspection of those lemmas which are formed by words with 
initials A-G shows that of the word-forms contained in them, about 
60 Pct can with reasonable certainty be assigned to a definite word 
class, about half as nouns, somewhat less as verbs, and a few as adjectives. 
The rest cannot be thus assigned, either because all the endings of 
the lemma may belong to paradigms of different word classes, or be- 
cause the same word-form belongs to lemmas of different paradigms, 
thus indicating the possibility of a homograph. 
Of the endings pertaining to a given paradigm, some convey a 
definitite syntactic function while others do not. 
These figures summarize the yield of the analysis as regards its 
function as a step in an automated syntactic analysis of the text. 
276 GUSTAV LEUNBACH 
A different summarization of the results of the analysis, which has 
some general interest, concerns the distribution of lemmas by length. 
The part of the lemmas investigated in detail show three lemmas of 
6 members and three of 5 members as the longest. 
Which words occur in so many flexions depends of course on the 
content of the text, but the numerical structure I suppose to be charac- 
teristic of a much wider range of self-contained texts; if the investiga- 
tion is carried out on the vocabularies of different exts, an interesting 
by-product may be the study of the stability of this structure. 
One may be interested in a different ype of statistical analysis, 
namely of the frequencies of various grammatical categories, for in- 
stance, the frequencies of singular and plural forms of nouns, of present 
and past tense. For this purpose, however, the analysis performed here 
is not sufficient, not even combined with the frequency count of all 
word-forms mentioned in the introduction: firstly, the analysis express- 
ly only recognizes a flexion ending if at least two different endings 
to the same stem occur; that is, the frequency of e.g. plural forms may 
be counted only for those nouns which are represented in at least two 
forms. Secondly, in the Danish nominal paradigms not all forms are 
with certainty identifiable as either singular or plural, and in the regular 
verbal paradigms the simple past is always the same form as a parti- 
ciple which is used in an adjectival function, and not in composite 
tenses.  
(For the purpose of test parsing, the latter ambiguity is not a funda- 
mental obstacle; whenever such a form is encountered two possibilities 
must be left open, and one must hope that other words of the period 
will close one possibility).
