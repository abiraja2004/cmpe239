Abstract 
We describe a program for assigning 
correct stress contours to nominals in English. 
It makes use of idiosyncratic knowledge about 
the stress behavior of various nominal types 
and general knowledge about English stress 
rules. We have also investigated the related 
issue of parsing complex nominals in English. 
The importance of this work and related 
research to the problem of text-to-speech is 
'discussed. 
I. Introduction 
We will discuss the analysis of English 
expressions consisting of a head noun preceded 
by one or more open.class specifiers: rising 
prices, horse blanket, mushroom omelet, banana 
bread, parish priest, gurgle detector, 
quarterback sneak, blind spot, red herring, 
bachelor's degree, Planck's constant, Madison 
Avenue, Wall Street, Washington's birthday 
sale, error correction code logic, steel industry 
collective bargaining agreement, expensive toxic 
waste cleanup, windshield wiper blade 
replacement, computer communications etwork 
performance analysis primer, and so forth. For 
brevity, we wil l  call such expressions 
'nominals.' Our main aim is an algorithm for 
assigning stress patterns to such nominal 
expressions; we will also discuss methods for 
parsing them. 
Nominals are hard to parse, since their 
pre-terminal string is usually consistent with 
all possible constituent structures, so that we 
seem to need an analysis of the relative 
plausibility of the various meanings (Marcus, 
1980; Finin, 1980). Even when the constituent 
structure is known (as trivially in the case of 
binary nominals), nominal stress patterns are 
hard to predict, and also seem to depend on 
meaning (Bolinger, 1972; Fudge, 1984; 
Selkirk, 1984). This is a serious problem for 
text-to-speech algorithms, since nominal 
expressions are common at the ends of 
phrases, and the location of a phrase's last 
accent has a large effect on its sound. 
Complex nominals are common in most kinds 
of text; for example, in the million words of 
the Brown Corpus (Francis and Ku~era, 1982), 
there are over 73,000 nominals containing 
more than two words. 
However, we have been able to make 
some progress on the problems of parsing and 
stress assignment for nominals in unrestricted 
text. This paper concentrates on the 
representation and use of knowledge relevant 
to the problem of assigning stress; this same 
knowledge turns out to be useful in parsing. 
For the purposes of this paper, we will be 
dealing with nominals in contexts where the 
default stress pattern is not shifted by 
phenomena such as as intonational focus or 
contrastive stress, exemplified below: 
(1) a. We're only interested in solvable 
problems. (words like only depend 
on stress to set their scope m 
otherwise, this nominal's main stress 
would be on its final word.) 
b. He's a lion-tamer, not a lion-hunter. 
(in a non-contrastive context, these 
nominals' main stresses would be on 
their penultimate words.) 
These interesting phenomena rarely I shift 
main phrase stress in expository text, and are 
1. In our samples, only a fraction of a percent of complex 
nominals in phrase-final position have their main stress 
shifted by focus or contrast.

best seen as a modulation of the null- 
hypothesis tress patterns. 
We have argued elsewhere (Liberman and 
Sproat, 1987) for the following positions: (i) 
the syntax of modification is quite free m 
various modifiers of nominal heads (including 
adjectives, nouns, and possessives) may occur 
as sisters of any X-bar projection of the 
nominal head; (ii) modification at different 
X-bar levels expresses different types of 
meaning relations (see also Jackendoff, 1973); 
(iii) the English nominal system includes many 
special constructions that do not conform to 
the usual specifier-head patterns, such as 
complex names, time and date expressions, 
and so forth; (iv) the default stress pattern 
depends on the syntactic structure. 
Points (ii) and (iv) are common opinions 
in the linguistic literature. In particular, we 
support generative phonology's traditional 
view of phrasal stress rules, which is that 
structures of category N O have the pattern 
assigned by the compound stress rule, which 
makes left-hand subconstituents stress- 
dominant unless their right-hand sisters are 
lexically complex. 2 In simple binary cases, this 
amounts to left-hand stress. All other 
structures are (recursively) right stressed, 
according to what is called the nuclear stress 
rule. 3 
Points (i) and (iii) are less commonplace. 
They make it impossible to predict stress from 
the preterminal string of a binary nominal, 
since the left-hand element may be attached at 
any bar level, or may be involved in some 
special construction. We do not have space to 
2. Various authors (e.g. Liberman & Prince 1977, Hayes 
1980) have suggested that the behavior of the 
compound stress rule, which in fact applies to 
compound nouns but not to compound adjectives or
verbs, is related to the tendency of non-compound 
English nouns to have their main stress one syllable 
farther back than equivalent verbs or adjectives. This 
generalization strengthens the argument that IN N\] 
constituents with left-hand stress are of parent category 
N O . 
3. See Chomsky and Halle (1968), Liberman and Prince 
(1977), Hayes (1980) for various versions of these 
rules. 
argue here for this point of view, but some 
illustrative examples may help make our 
position clearer. 
Examples of adjectives and possessives 
within N O include sticky bun, black belt, safe 
house, straight edge, sick room, medical 
supplies, cashier's check, user's manual, chefs 
knife, Melzer's solution, etc. We can see that 
this is not simply a matter of non- 
compositional semantics by contrasting the 
stress pattern of red herring, blue moon, Irish 
stew, hard liquor, musical chairs, dealer's 
choice, Avogadro' s number, cat's pajamas. The 
N O status of e.g. user's manual can be seen by 
its stress pattern as well as its willingness to 
occur inside quantifiers and adjectives: three 
new user's manuals, but *three new John's 
books. In addition, there are several classes of 
possessive phrases that take right-hand stress 
but pattern distributionally like adjectives, i.e. 
occur at N l level, as in three Kirtland's 
Warblers. Examples of nouns at N 1 level 
include the common 'material-made-of' 
modifiers (such as steel bar, rubber boots, 
paper plate, beef burrito,), as well as most time 
and place modifiers (garage door, attic roof, 
village street, summer palace, spring cleaning, 
holiday cheer, weekend news), some types of 
modification by proper names (India ink, 
Tiffany lamp, Miami vice, Ming vase), and so 
on. 
Thus a stress-assignment algorithm must 
depend on meaning relationships between 
members of the nominal, as well as the 
collocational propensities of the words 
involved. 
We have written a program that performs 
fairly well at the task of assigning stress to 
nominals in unrestricted text. The input is a 
constituent structure for the nominal, and the 
output is a representation f its stress contour. 
Some examples of nominals to which the 
program assigns stress correctly are given in 
(2), where primary stress is marked by 
boldface and secondary stress by italics: 
141

\[\[Boston University\] [Psychology Department\]\] 
\[\[\[Tom Paine\] Avenue\] Blues\] 
\[corn flakes\] 
\[rice pudding\] 
\[apricot jam\] 
\[wood floor\] 
\[cotton shirt\] 
\[kitchen towel\] 
\[Philadelphia lawyer\] 
\[city employee\] 
\[valley floor\] 
\[afternoon sun\] 
\[evening primrose\] 
\[Easter bunny\] 
\[morning sickness\] 
\[\[Staten Island \] Ferry\] 
\[South street\] 
\[baggage claim\] 
\[Mississippi Valley\] 
\[Buckingham Palace\] 
\[Surprise Lake\] 
\[Murray Hill\] 
There are two main components to the 
program, the first of which deals almost 
exclusively with binary nominals and the 
second which takes n-ary nominals and figures 
out the stress pattern of those. We deal with 
each in turn. 
2. Binary Nominals 
Much of the work in assigning stress to 
nominals in English involves figuring out what 
to do in the binary cases, and this section will 
discuss how various classes of binary (and 
some n-ary nominals, n>2) are handled. For 
example, to stress \[\[Boston University\] 
\[Psychology Department\]\] correctly it is 
necessary to know that Psychology Department 
is stressed on the left-hand member. Once 
that is known, the stress contour of the whole 
four-member nominal follows from general 
principles, which will be outlined in the 
subsequent section of this paper. 
To determine the stress pattern of a 
binary nominal, the following procedure is 
followed: 
1. First of all, check to see if the nominal is 
listed as being one of those which is 
exceptionally stressed. For instance, our list 
of some 7000 left-stressed nominals includes 
\[morning sickness\], which will thus get left 
stress despite the general preference for right 
stress in nominals where the left-hand member 
is construed as as describing a location or time 
for the right-hand member. \[Morning 
prayers\], which follows the regular pattern, is 
stressed correctly by the program. Similarly, 
\['Easter Bunny\] is listed as taking left stress 
whereas \[Easter feast\] is correctly stressed on 
the right. There is a common misconception 
to the effect that all and only the lexicalizcd 
(i.e. listed) nominal expressions arc left- 
stressed. This is false: lexicalization is neither 
a necessary nor a sufficient condition for left 
stress. Dog annihilator is left-stressed 
although not a member of the phrasal exicon, 
and red herring is right-stressed although it 
must be lexically listed. Such examples abound 
(see, also, section 1). 
2. If the nominal is not listed, check through 
all of the heuristic patterns that might fit it. A 
few examples of these patterns are given below 
m some of them are semantic or pragmatic in 
character, others are syntactic, and others are 
simply lexical. Note that there is not an easy 
boundary (for such an algorithm) between a 
pattern based on meaning and one based on 
word identity, since semantic classes 
correspond roughly to lists of words. 
MEASURE-PHRASE: the left-hand member 
describes a unit of measure in terms of which 
the right-hand member is valued. Examples: 
dollar bill, pint jug, S gallon tank... These 
normally take right stress. 
LOCATION-TIME-OR-SUBSTANCE: the 
left-hand member describes the location or 
time of the right-hand member, or else a 
substance out of which the right-hand member 
is made. Location examples: kitchen towel, 
downstairs bedroom, city hall... Time 
examples: Monday morning, Christmas Day, 
summer vacation... Substance xamples: wood 
floor, china doll, iron maiden. These normally 
take right stress. 
ING-NOMINAL, AGENT-NOMINAL, 
DERIVED-NOMINAL: All of these are cases 
142 
where the right-hand member is a noun 
derived from a verb, either by affix .ing 
(sewing), -er (catcher) or some other affix 
(destruction). Nominals with these typically 
have left-hand stress if the left-hand member 
can be construed as a grammatical object of 
the verb contained in the right-hand member: 
dog catcher, baby sitting, automobile 
demolition. On the other hand if the left-hand 
member is a subject of the verb in the right- 
hand member then stress is usually right-hand: 
woman swimmer, child dancing, student 
demonstration. 
NOUN-NOUN:  If both elements are nouns, 
and no other considerations intervene, left- 
hand stress occurs a majority of the time. 
Therefore a sort of default rule votes for left- 
hand stress when this pattern is matched. 
Examples of correct application include: dog 
house, opera buff, memory cache. Not much 
weight is given to this possibility, since 
something which is simply possibly a left- 
stressed noun-noun compound may be many 
other things as well. Complex typologies of 
the meaning relations in noun-noun 
compounds can be found in Lees (1960), 
Quirk et al (1972), Levi (1978). These 
typologies cross-cut the stress regularities in 
odd ways, and are semantically rather 
inhomogeneous as well, so their usefulness is 
questionable. 
SELF: The left-hand member is the word self 
(e.g~, self promotion, self analysis...). Right- 
hand stress is invariably assigned, since self is 
anaphoric, hence destressed following the 
normal pattern for anaphors. 
PLACE-NAME: The right-hand member is a 
word like pond, mountain, avenue tc., and the 
left-hand member is plausibly a name. These 
cases get right-hand stress. Obviously, names 
ending in the word Street are an exception 
(\[Madison Avenue\] vs. \[Wall Street\]). 
All of the applicable patterns for a given 
nominal are collected. Each pattern has a 
weight. For instance, as noted above, little 
weight is given to the observation that a 
particular nominal may be a noun-noun 
compound, since the preterminal string \[IN N\] 
often belongs to categories that yield right- 
hand stress. On the other hand, if the analysis 
and its stress pattern are almost certain, as it is 
for sequences of the form \[self N\], then much 
weight is given to this pattern. The weights 
arc tallied up as 'votes' for assigning to one 
member or the other. The pattern with the 
most votes wins. Currently the weights are 
assigned in an ad hoe manner by hand; we 
plan to replace the manual weight assignment 
with the results of a statistical survey of 
nominal types in various forms of English. 
3. Assigning Stress to N.Ary Nominals 
Given the stress pattern of binary cases, 
assigning stress to the general n-ary case is 
straightforward. The algorithm implemented 
is a version of one developed over the years by 
various researchers, including Chomsky and 
Halle (1968), Liberman and Prince (1977), 
Hayes (1980)~ Prince (1983) and others. Main 
stress is assigned to each level of constituent 
structure recursively, with relative stress values 
normally preserved as larger pieces of 
structure are considered. A convenient 
representation for tallying stress is the so- 
called 'metrical grid'; each word is associated 
with a set of marks or ticks on a grid whose 
higher, sparser levels correspond to metrically 
more important positions. For example, dog 
catcher would be represented as: 
(3) 
dog catcher 
The fact that dog has two ticks as opposed 
to the one tick assigned to catcher is indicative 
of the stress prominence of dog. 
When we combine two constituents 
together we upgrade the ticks of the highest 
tick-column of the weakest member to be the 
same as the highest column of the strongest 
member. For instance if we combine dog 
catcher with training school board meeting we 
will proceed by the following method: 
143 
(4) 
* * to 
, * tO tO tO tO 
dog catcher + training school board meeting 
dog catcher training school board meeting 
As a result, the most stressed element in 
each subunit starts out at 'tick parity' with the 
most stressed element in the other subunit. 
We then increment one of these main stresses 
to make it the main stress of the entire 
nomina l :  
(5) 
dog catcher training school board meeting 
Finally the program tests for the 
applicability of the so-called Rhythm Rule. 
Given the rules so far, for a nominal such as 
City Hall parking lot we would expect the 
following stress contour: 
(6) 
to * 
City Hall parking lot 
However, the actual stress contour is: 
4. As pointed out in Liberman (1975), such bottom-up 
recursive stress assignment algorithms can simply be 
thought of as the definition of a relation of relative 
prominence on all the sets of sister nodes in the tree. 
(7) 
City Hall parking lot 
The Rhythm Rule removes clashes 
between strong stresses by moving the left- 
hand stress back to the most prominent 
previous stress within the domain of the left- 
hand primary stress. 
4. Performance of the Heuristic on 200 Binary 
Nominals. 
To get a rough idea of how well our 
program is doing, we took 200 \[IN N\] nominals 
from the Bell Labs News, and compared the 
performance of the current heuristic with two 
other procedures: (1) assigning stress 
uniformly to the right (which is what all 
current text-to-speech systems would do in 
such cases) and (2) assigning stress to the left 
if and only if the binary nominal can be 
analyzed as consisting of a noun followed by a 
noun. We had made no previous effort to 
develop heuristics appropriate for the content 
of this source material. The results were as 
follows: 
(8) (i) Assigning uniform rightward stress: 
45% correct. 
(ii) Assigning leftward stress if N-N: 
66%. 
(iii) Current program: 80%. 
Of our program's 40-odd failures, the 
cause was insufficient information in roughly 
30 cases; only 10 were due to misanalysis. We 
classified the failure as being due to 
insufficient information when the program 
could say nothing about the categorization of 
either member of the compound, or could only 
ascertain that it might be dealing with a noun- 
noun sequence (which, the reader will recall, 
is given very little weight in making a 
decision). For instance, the program knows 
nothing about the stress properties of chemical 
terms, which invariably have right-hand stress, 
and therefore failed on gallium arsenide and 
several similar expressions. I f  the program 
had some information about at least one of the 
words, but still came up with the wrong 
144 
answer, then we classified the error as a case 
of misanalysis. The fact that most of the 
errors were due to insufficient information 
suggests that the program can be improved 
substantially by increasing its set of heuristic 
patterns and its knowledge of word classes. 
We guess that 90-95% correct stress is a 
plausible goal for t'N N\] nominals, even in 
technical writing, where our experience 
suggests that readers will assign left-hand and 
right-hand stress to such constituents with 
about equal frequency. 
$. The Parsing Issue. 
Our stress assignment program assumes a
parsed input, not a reasonable option for a 
working text-to-speech system. There is some 
practical value in correct stress assignment to 
binary nominals only, since they are 
commoner than longer ones in most kinds of 
text; in the Tagged Brown Corpus (Francis and 
KuSera, 1982) we found that roughly 80% of 
the complex nominals were binary, 15% were 
ternary, and that therefore only about 5% had 
more than three members. Still, a count of 
15% for ternary nominals is significant. 
Furthermore, higher percentages for complex 
nominals with more than two members are 
expected for technical writing than are 
exhibited in the Brown Corpus. We have 
therefore also investigated the use of the 
stress-assignment heuristics in parsing nominal 
expressions of higher complexity than binary. 
How would such patterns be useful? Consider 
an expression like water supply control, to 
which we would want to assign the structure 
\[\[water supply\] control\]. Given that we 
assume binary branching, we have two 
options, namely \[water \[supply control\]\] and 
\[\[water supply\] control\]. While the fn'st 
analysis is not impossible, the second analysis 
would be favored since one of our patterns 
references the word supply, and lists substances 
such as water among the types of things that 
can have supplies. In effect, supply has a slot 
to its left which can optionally be filled by a 
noun referring to a substance or commodity of 
some kind, among which water is a prominent 
example. The word supply is not nearly so 
close to the core examples of likely arguments 
for control. Of course, listed complex 
nominals straightforwardly aid in  parsing: a 
nominal such as City Hall parking lot is fairly 
easy to analyze given that in any case City Hall 
and parking lot are in our phrasal exicon. 
It seems clear that substantial amounts of 
lexical knowledge are necessary to parse 
complex nominals. This comes as no surprise, 
in light of much recent linguistic work 
suggesting that a substantial portion of 
linguistic knowledge resides 'in the lexicon.'
