Abstract
The relationship between small molecules
and proteins has attracted attention from the
biomedical research community. In this pa-
per a text mining method of extracting small-
molecule and protein pairs from natural text
is presented, based on a semi-supervised ma-
chine learning approach. The technique has
been applied to the complete collection of
MEDLINE abstracts and pairs were extracted
and evaluated. The results show the feasibility
of the bootstrapping system, which will subse-
quently be further investigated and improved.
1 Introduction
Information extraction has become a major task in
text-mining. A large number of studies have been
carried out with the objective of developing tech-
niques to overcome the highly ambiguous and vari-
able nature of natural language for the extraction of
information from scientific text (Song et al., 2006).
Natural language processing (NLP) of biomedical
text has been initiated and used for different knowl-
edge discovery tasks such as the extraction of rela-
tionships between different types of biological ob-
jects.
Relationships between proteins and small
molecules are of particular concern in the biomed-
ical research domain. The importance of target
specific small molecule research is vital in the
scientific community?s understanding of numerous
biological processes with potential discoveries
yielding various translational benefits and outcomes
to public health and industry. While there has been
a great number of traditional studies already com-
pleted in this field, the underlying difficulty with this
type of research has been trying to understand how
one molecule interacts with a target protein. Given
the biological background, many researchers in
Cheminformatics and Metabolomics are attempting
to find the connections between small molecules
and other biological entities in order to bridge the
chemical and biological domains.
Of the few reported text mining approaches to this
problem, Temkin and Gilder (2003) was concerned
with the extraction of protein and small molecule in-
teraction, and used a rule-based approach utilising
a lexical analyser and context free grammar. Jiao
and Wild (2009) presented a technique for detect-
ing protein and small molecule interaction using a
maximum entropy based learning method; this work
also uses corpus-based machine learning. The main
drawback of both of these studies is that they require
a fully annotated corpus which is difficult to gener-
ate.
1.1 The bootstrapping method
At present a gold standard annotated corpus is not
available, and constructing a reasonable annotated
corpus would require an infeasible amount of man-
ual work. Our proposed solution to this problem
is to develop a semi-supervised machine learning
method. In this paper a bootstrapping algorithm is
presented which requires only unannotated training
texts and a handful of protein small molecule pairs,
known as seeds. The basic work of a bootstrap-
ping system can be presented as an expansion en-
gine which uses the initial seed pairs fed into the
172
system to generate patterns that are used, in turn, to
find more pairs. The operation of the algorithm is
controlled by certain criteria that are delivered from
a measurement of the quality or selectivity of pat-
terns and discovered pairs.
Bootstrapping systems have been maturely used
for information extraction purposes in other research
domains, and it has been empirically shown to be
a powerful method in learning lexico-syntactic pat-
terns for extracting specific relations (Riloff and
Jones, 1999). Bootstrapping systems can operate
with a greatly reduced number of training examples.
A bootstrapping system seems promising for the
purpose of relation extraction, making it a suitable
candidate method for protein and small molecule
pair extraction.
2 Implementation
The typical bootstrapping method was tailored in
order to improve its suitability for our extraction
task, operating in the biomedical literature resource
MEDLINE. The bootstrapping architecture is pre-
sented in Figure 1. The whole collection of MED-
LINE was filtered using a co-occurrence approach
and a named entity recogniser. In this way the
sentences which contained both a protein and a
small molecule were selected. The structure of pat-
terns which are suitable to extract protein and small
molecule pairs from MEDLINE was defined. Each
sentence is tokenized and then normalised based on
the results of syntactic parsing in order to obtain a
more generalised view of the pattern. In the fol-
lowing sections, we describe in more detail these as-
pects.
2.1 Protein and small molecule recognition
Two dictionary-based named entity recognisers
were used to detect the names of proteins and small
molecules in the full collection of MEDLINE ab-
stracts, with the two source dictionaries constructed
using the resources UniProt (Apweiler et al., 2004)
and ChEBI (De Matos et al., 2006) respectively. The
following example shows the two recognisers iden-
tify a chemical object and a protein object in a sen-
tence from a MEDLINE extract:
<chebi>Paracetamol</chebi>, 100 mg/kg, in-
hibited <uniprot>COX-1</uniprot> in stomach
Figure 1: Extraction system architecture
mucosa ex vivo much less effectively than in other
tissues.
2.2 Sentence analysis for normalisation
It was anticipated that variations in tense and other
language characteristics would cause problems in
pattern generation. We therefore applied a list of
normalisation steps for pattern generation. The sur-
rounding context in the biomedical text is not nor-
mally useful and makes it difficult to identify the text
and observe a clear sentence structure. The parsing
result normalises patterns by eliminating non-useful
components in a sentence. The step of normalisation
hence increases the quality of the pattern.
The complete list of normalisation steps is as fol-
lows:
1. Replaced the representation of measurement
units, such as mg/L and ml/day.
2. Employed the part-of-speech (POS) tagger GE-
NIA (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) to analyse each to-
ken, and the tokens which are weakly related to
the sentence structure were removed. So that,
the only remaining tokens are the head noun of
a noun phrase (NP), the verb phrase, and prepo-
sitional phrase chunks.
3. Finally a simple rule to identify the head noun
was defined. In a general case, for a NP se-
quence, the last token is considered as the head
noun. When the last token is a single character,
the second last token is considered as the head
noun.

Table 1: An example of a generated pattern
Seed tuple: Paracetamol, COX-1
Found string: ?CHEBI, UNIT, inhibit UNIPROT
in mucosa than in tissue.?
Pattern: NP List1, UNIT, inhibit NP List2
Constraints: NP List1=?CHEBI*?
NP List2=?UNIPROT*?
Keywords: ?,UNIT,inhibit?
The above example after these normalisation
steps becomes:
CHEBI*, UNIT, inhibit UNIPROT* in mucosa
than in tissue.
where CHEBI* and UNIPROT* are the seeds in
context.
2.3 Bootstrapping
The bootstrapping system is applied to the nor-
malised sentences. The process starts with 100
high precision protein small molecule pairs col-
lected from the ChEBI ontology. These pairs were
retrieved by querying the ChEBI sub-ontology for
the relation ?has role?. From the resulting data we
extracted small molecules that are enzyme inhibitors
together with the name of the enzyme.
2.3.1 Pattern generation and pair extraction
The concept of a bootstrapping system is that us-
ing a high precision seed pair to start the extrac-
tion engine, the system can effectively learn the pat-
tern construction rule and the pattern constraints.
Searching for the seed pairs in the corpus returns
strings which are candidate extraction patterns for
other pairs. The candidate patterns are made up of
?slots? and ?context strings?, where the slots are ei-
ther of type small-molecule or protein, and context
is the text connecting the slots and the words imme-
diately before and after the pair. By analysing the
surrounding context of the slots new elements of the
pattern are discovered, which can subsequently be
used to search for new small-molecule protein pairs.
The process of deriving a pattern from the above ex-
ample is shown in Table 1.
The generated pattern can then be used to search
the corpus and find other matching contexts. New
pairs are retrieved from the matching context by
simply locating the protein and small molecule
names from the same positions as they are in the pat-
tern.
For instance, the pattern produced in Table 1 is
matched against a normalised sentence ?data sug-
gest CHEBI, UNIT, inhibit UNIPROT?, extracting
the new pair <trifluoperazine, CaMKII>.
2.3.2 Evaluating seeds and patterns
The quality of the pattern is critical since pat-
terns that generate a bad pair can introduce more
false positive seeds. Therefore, within a bootstrap-
ping system it is necessary to have a stage of pattern
evaluation. Estimations of the confidence score of
a pattern can be used as one of the stopping criteria.
We implemented an evaluation step for both patterns
and pairs based on an evaluation method developed
by Agichtein and Gravano (2000). Adapting the ap-
proach to this work, if patterni predicts tuple t =
<chemical, protein>, and there is already a tuple
t? = <chemical, protein?> with high confidence,
and chemical from t is same as chemical from t?,
then we could define this as a positive match of pat-
tern (Ppositive), otherwise the pattern is considered
as a negative match (Pnegative). So that the confi-
dence score of pattern (P ) is estimated as:
Conf(P ) =
Ppositive
Ppositive + Pnegative
(1)
To evaluate the pairs we again employ the method
described by Agichtein and Gravano (2000). The
confidence of a particular pair is a function of the
number of patterns that generate it. Equation 2
shows how to calculate a confidence score for tuple
T , where P is the set of patterns that derive T . Ci is
the context that also contains T , Match(Ci, Pi) is
the degree of match of Ci and Pi.
Conf(T ) = 1?
?|P |
I=0 (1? (Conf (Pi) ? Match (Ci, Pi)))

3 Results and discussion
Table 2 shows the top 10 generated patterns ranked
by the frequency that they appear in MEDLINE. As
can be seen the patterns all have very simple struc-
tures. Simple patterns are more likely to be produc-
tive, i.e the simpler the structure of the pattern, the
more pairs it generates. However, simple structures
are also likely to generate more false negative pairs.
174
The pairs produced by these top 10 patterns were
collected, and the confidence score then calculated
using equation 1. The result implies that the confi-
dence score of a pattern, and in turn the selectivity
and productivity of the pattern, are strongly associ-
ated with the pattern?s structure.

3.1 Quality of the extracted pairs
One hundred pairs extracted by first and second gen-
eration patterns were randomly selected for manual
inspection by a domain expert curator. It was found
that over 60% were valid pairs. From further exami-
nation of the cases together with their extraction pat-
terns, it can be seen that the patterns have a high con-
fidence score, ensuring the quality of the extracted
pair. For instance, from the original text Paraceta-
mol, 100 mg/kg, inhibited COX-1 in stomach mucosa
ex vivo much less effectively than in other tissues, the
pattern ?CHEBI*, UNIT, inhibit UNIPROT*? with
0.62 confidence score derives a correct pair <Parac-
etamol, COX-1>.
Generally speaking, simple patterns are more
likely to have lower confidence scores. However it
was also found that the pattern quality heavily de-
pends on the quality and reliability of the name en-
tity recognition (NE) system.
4 Conclusions and future work
We have presented a method of detecting small
molecule and protein pairs in MEDLINE abstracts.
It employs semi-supervised machine learning meth-
ods to enable patterns to be automatically generated,
rather than requiring human input. The approach can
be used for high throughput text mining applications
where manual curation is unrealistic.
The first and second iteration of results are
promising and show that the approach enables many
useful small molecule protein pairs to be extracted
from MEDLINE using just a small number of seed
pairs as input. The approach makes use of a rigor-
ous method of evaluating the quality of generated
patterns and extracted pairs. Manual inspection has
been used to validate these preliminary results and
has shown that approximately half of the discovered
pairs represent valid small molecule protein relation-
ships, and we expect to improve this significantly.
In future we will develop the method further
and analyse the results after further algorithm iter-
ations, enabling discovery of new patterns and con-
sequently new pairs of proteins and small molecules
that are currently undetected.
