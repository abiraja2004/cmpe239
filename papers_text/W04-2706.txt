Abstract
The requirements of the depth and precision
of annotation vary for different intended uses
of the corpus but it has been commonly ac-
cepted nowadays that the standard annotations
of surface structure are only the first steps in
a more ambitious research program, aiming at
a creation of advanced resources for most dif-
ferent systems of natural language processing
and for testing and further enrichment of lin-
guistic and computational theories. Among
the several possible directions in which we be-
lieve the standard annotation systems should
go (and in some cases already attempt to go)
beyond the POS tagging or shallow syntactic
annotations, the following four are character-
ized in the present contribution: (i) predicate-
argument representation of the underlying syn-
tactic relations as basically corresponding to a
rooted tree that can be univocally linearized,
(ii) the inclusion of the information structure
using very simple means (the left-to-right or-
der of the nodes and three attribute values),
(iii) relating this underlying structure (render-
ing the ?linguistic meaning,? i.e. the semanti-
cally relevant counterparts of the grammatical
means of expression) to certain central aspects
of referential semantics (reference assignment
and coreferential relations), and (iv) handling
of word sense disambiguation. The first three
issues are documented in the present paper on
the basis of our experience with the devel-
opment of the structure and scenario of the
Prague Dependency Treebank which provides
for syntactico-semantic annotation of large text
segments from the Czech National Corpus and
which is based on a solid theoretical frame-
work.
1 Introduction1
It has been commonly accepted within the computational
linguistics community involved in corpus annotation that
part-of-speech tagging and shallow syntactic annotation
though very progressive, important and useful tasks at
their time, are only the first steps in a more ambitious
research program, aiming at a creation of advanced re-
sources for most different systems of natural language
processing and for testing and further enrichment of lin-
guistic and computational theories. On the basis of our
experience with the development and implementation of
the annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT, (Hajic? et al, 2001a), (Bo?hmova?, 2004)), we
would like to indicate four directions, in which we be-
lieve the standard annotation systems should be (and in
some cases already attempt to be) extended to fulfill the
present expectations. We believe that we can offer useful
insights in three of these, namely
(i) an adequate and perspicuous way to represent the
underlying syntactic relations as basically corre-
sponding to a rooted tree that can be equivocally lin-
earized,
(ii) with the inclusion of the information structure us-
ing very simple means (the left-to-right order of the
nodes and two indexes), and
(iii) in relating this underlying structure (rendering the
?linguistic meaning,? i.e. the semantically relevant
counterparts of the grammatical means of expres-
sion) to certain central issues of referential seman-
tics (reference assignment and coreferential rela-
tions).
1The research reported on in this paper has been supported
by the project of the Czech Ministry of Education LN00A063,
and by the grants of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic
No. 405/03/0913 and No. 405/03/0377.
These insights have been elaborated into annotation
guidelines which now are being used (and checked) on
the basis of PDT, i.e. of syntactico-semantic annotations
of large text segments from the Czech National Corpus,
which allows for a reliable confirmation of the adequacy
of the chosen theoretical framework and for its enrich-
ment in individual details. The fourth dimension we have
in mind is that of handling word-sense disambiguation,
for which the material of our annotated texts, the PDT,
serves as a starting point.
2 The Extensions
2.1 The Structure: Deep Dependency and Valency
The development of formal theories of grammar has doc-
umented that when going beyond the shallow grammat-
ical structure toward some kind of functional or seman-
tic structure, two notions become of fundamental impor-
tance: the notion of the head of the structure and the no-
tion of valency (i.e. of the requirements that the heads
impose on the structure they are heads of). To adduce
just some reflections of this tendency from American
linguistic scene, Fillmore?s ?case grammar? (with verb
frames) and his FrameNet ((Fillmore et al, 2003)), Bres-
nan?s and Kaplans?s lexical functional grammar (with
the distinction between the constituent and the functional
structure and with an interesting classification of func-
tions) and Starosta?s ?lexicase grammar? can serve as
the earliest examples. To put it in terms of formal syn-
tactic frameworks, the phrase structure models take on
at least some traits of the dependency models of lan-
guage; Robinson has shown that even though Fillmore
leaves the issue of formal representation open, the phrase-
structure based sentence structure he proposes can be eas-
ily and adequately transposed in terms of dependency
grammar. Dependency account of sentence structure is
deeply rooted in European linguistic tradition and it is no
wonder then that formal descriptions originating in Eu-
rope are dependency-based (see Sgall, Kunze, Hellwig,
Hudson, Mel?chuk). We understand it as crucial to use
sentence representations ?deep? enough to be adequate as
an input to a procedure of semantic(-pragmatic) interpre-
tation (i.e. representing function words and endings by
indexes of node labels, restoring items which are deleted
in the morphemic or phonemic forms of sentences and
distinguishing tens of kinds of syntactic relations), rather
than to be satisfied with some kind of ?surface? syntax.
The above-mentioned development of formal frame-
works toward an inclusion of valency in some way or an-
other has found its reflection in the annotation scenarios
that aimed at going beyond the shallow structure of sen-
tences. An important support for annotation conceived in
this way can be found in schemes that are based on an
investigation of the subcategorization of lexical units that
function as heads of complex structures, see. Fillmore?s
FRAMENET, the PropBank as a further stage of the de-
velopment of the Penn Treebank (Palmer et al, 2001)
and Levin?s verb classes (Levin, 1993) on which the LCS
Database (Dorr, 2001) is based. There are other systems
working with some kind of ?deep syntactic? annotation,
e.g. the broadly conceived Italian project carried out in
Pisa (N. Calzolari, A. Zampolli) or the Taiwanese project
MARVS; another related framework is presented by the
German project NEGRA, basically surface oriented, with
which the newly produced subcorpus TIGER contains
more information on lexical semantics. Most work that
has already been carried out concerns subcategorization
frames (valency) of verbs but this restriction is not nec-
essary: not only verbs but also nouns or adjectives and
adverbs may have their ?frames? or ?grids?.
One of the first complex projects aimed at a deep (un-
derlying) syntactic annotation of a large corpus is the al-
ready mentioned Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic?,
1998); it is designed as a complex annotation of Czech
texts (taken from the Czech National Corpus); the under-
lying syntactic dependency relations (called functors) are
captured in the tectogrammatical tree structures (TGTS);
see (Hajic?ova?, 2000). The set of functors comprises
53 valency types subclassified into (inner) participants
(arguments) and (free) modifications (adjuncts). Some
of the free modifications are further subcategorized into
more subtle classes (constituting mainly the underlying
counterparts, or meanings, of prepositions).
Each verb entry in the lexicon is assigned a valency
frame specifying which type of participant or modifi-
cation can be associated with the given verb; the va-
lency frame also specifies which participant/modification
is obligatory and which is optional with the given verb
entry (in the underlying representations of sentences),
which of them is deletable on the surface, which may or
must function as a controller, and so on. Also nouns and
adjectives have their valency frames.
The shape of TGTSs as well as the repertory and clas-
sification of the types of modifications of the verbs is
based on the theoretical framework of the Functional
Generative Description, developed by the Prague re-
search team of theoretical and computational linguis-
tics as an alternative to Chomskyan transformational
grammar (Sgall et al, 1986). The first two arguments,
though labeled by ?semantically descriptive? tags ACT
and PAT (Actor and Patient, respectively) correspond
to the first and the second argument of a verb (cf.
Tesnie`re?s (Tesnie`re, 1959) first and second actant), the
other three arguments of the verb being then differen-
tiated (in accordance with semantic considerations) as
ADDR(essee), ORIG(in) or EFF(ect); these five func-
tors belong to the set of participants (arguments) and
are distinguished from (free) modifications (adjuncts)
such as LOC(ative), several types of directional and tem-
poral (e.g. TWHEN) modifications, APP(urtenance),
R(e)STR(ictive attribute), DIFF(erence), PREC(eding
cotext referred to), etc. on the basis of two basic oper-
ational criteria (Panevova?, 1974), (Panevova?, 1994):
(i) can the given type of modification modify in princi-
ple every verb?
(ii) can the given type of modification occur in the
clause more than once?
If the answers to (i) and (ii) are yes, then the modifica-
tion is an adjunct, if not, then we face an argument.
We assume that the cognitive roles can be determined
on the basis of combinations of the functors with the lex-
ical meanings of individual verbs (or other words), e.g.
the Actor of buy is the buyer, that of sell is the seller, the
Addressee and the Patient of tell are the experiencer and
the object of the message, respectively.The valency dic-
tionary created for and used during the annotation of the
Prague Dependency Treebank, called PDT-VALLEX, is
described in (Hajic? et al, 2003). The relation between
function and (morphological) form as used in the valency
lexicon is described in (Hajic? and Ures?ova?, 2003).
An illustration of this framework is presented in Fig. 1.

ever, the domestic producer got the heads four days later.?
Let us adduce further two examples in which the func-
tors are written in capitals in the otherwise strongly sim-
plified representations, where most of the adjuncts are un-
derstood as depending on nouns, whereas the other func-
tors concern the syntactic relations to the verb. Let us
note that with the verb arrive the above mentioned test
determines the Directional as a (semantically) obligatory
item that can be specified by the hearer according to the
given context (basically, as here or there):
(1) Jane changed her house from a shabby cottage into
a comfortable home.
(1?) Jane.ACT changed her.APP house.PAT
from-a-shabby.RSTR cottage.ORIG
into-a-comfortable.RSTR home.EFF.
(2) Yesterday Jim arrived by car.
(2?) Yesterday.TWHEN Jim.ACT arrived here.DIR3 by-
car.MEANS.
A formulation of an annotation scenario based on well-
specified subcategorization criteria helps to compare dif-
ferent schemes and to draw some conclusions from such
a comparison. In (Hajic?ova? and Kuc?erova?, 2002) the au-
thors attempt to investigate how different frameworks an-
notating some kind of deep (underlying) syntactic level
(the LCS Data, PropBank and PDT) compare with each
other (having in mind also a more practical applica-
tion, namely a machine translation project the modules
of which would be ?machine-learned?, using a procedure
based on syntactically annotated parallel corpora). We
are convinced that such a pilot study may also contribute
to the discussions on a possibility/impossibility of for-
mulating a ?theory neutral? syntactic annotation scheme.
The idea of a theory neutral annotation scenario seems
to be an unrealistic goal: it is hardly possible to imag-
ine a classification of such a complex subsystem of lan-
guage as the syntactic relations are, without a well mo-
tivated theoretical background; moreover, the languages
of the annotated texts are of different types, and the the-
oretical frameworks the authors of the schemes are used
to work with differ in the ?depth? or abstractness of the
classification of the syntactic relations. However, the dif-
ferent annotation schemes seem to be translatable if the
distinctions made in them are stated as explicitly as pos-
sible, with the use of operational criteria, and supported
by larger sentential contexts. The third condition is made
realistic by very large text corpora being available elec-
tronically; making the first two conditions a realistic goal
is fully in the hands of the designers of the schemes.
2.2 Topic/Focus Articulation
Another aspect of the sentence structure that has to be
taken into account when going beyond the shallow struc-
ture of sentences is the communicative function of the
sentence, reflected in its information structure. As has
been convincingly argued for during decades of linguistic
discussions (see studies by Rooth, Steedman, and several
others, and esp. the argumentation in (Hajic?ova? et al,
1998)), the information structure of the sentence (topic-
focus articulation, TFA in the sequel) is semantically rel-
evant and as such belongs to the semantic structure of the
sentence. A typical declarative sentence expresses that
its focus holds about its topic, and this articulation has
its consequences for the truth conditions, especially for
the differences between meaning proper, presuppositiona
and allegations (see (Hajic?ova?, 1993); (Hajic?ova? et al,
1998)).
TFA often is understood to constitute a level of its own,
but this is not necessary, and it would not be simple to de-
termine the relationships between this level and the other
layers of language structure. In the Functional Generative
Description (Sgall et al, 1986), TFA is captured as one of
the basic aspects of the underlying structure, namely as
the left-to-right dimension of the dependency tree, work-
ing with the basic opposition of contextual boundness;
the contextually bound (CB) nodes stand to the left of the
non-bound (NB) nodes, with the verb as the root of the
tree being either contextually bound or non-bound.
It should be noted that the opposition of NB/CB is the
linguistically patterned counterpart of the cognitive (and
pre-systemic) opposition of ?given? and ?new? informa-
tion. Thus, e.g. in (3) the pronoun him (being NB), in
fact constitutes the focus of the sentence.
(3) (We met a young pair.) My older companion recog-
nized only HIM.
In the prototypical case, NB items belong to the focus
of the sentence, and CB ones constitute its topic; sec-
ondary cases concern items which are embedded more
deeply than to depend on the main verb of the sentence,
cf. the position of older in (3), which may be understood
as NB, although it belongs to the topic (being an adjunct
of the CB noun companion).
In the tectogrammatical structures of the PDT anno-
tation scenario, we work with three values of the TFA
attribute, namely t (contextually bound node), c (contex-
tually bound contrastive node) and f (contextually non-
bound node). 20,000 sentences of the PDT have al-
ready been annotated in this way, and the consistency and
agreement of the annotators is being evaluated. It seems
to be a doable task to annotate and check the whole set of
TGTSs (i.e. 55,000 sentences) by the end of 2004. This
means that by that time the whole set of 55,000 sentences
will be annotated (and checked for consistency) on both
aspects of deep syntactic structure. An algorithm the in-
put of which are the TGTSs with their TFA values and
the output of which is the division of the whole sentence
structure into the (global) topic and the (global) focus is
being formulated.
2.3 Coreference
The inclusion into the annotation scheme of the two as-
pects mentioned above in Sect. 2.1 and 2.2, namely the
deep syntactic relations and topic-focus articulation, con-
siderably extends the scenario in a desirable way, toward
a more complex representation of the meaning of the sen-
tence. The third aspect, the account of coreferential rela-
tions, goes beyond linguistic meaning proper toward what
can be called the sense of the utterance (Sgall, 1994).
Two kinds of coreferential relations have to be distin-
guished: grammatical coreference (i.e. with verbs of con-
trol, with reflexive pronouns, with verbal complements
and with relative pronouns) and textual (which may cross
sentence boundaries), both endophoric and exophoric.
Several annotation schemes have been reported at re-
cent conferences (ACL, LREC) that attempt at a rep-
resentation of coreference relations in continuous texts.
As an example of an attempt to integrate the treatment
of anaphora into a complex deep syntactic scenario, we
would like to present here a brief sketch of the scheme
realized in the Prague Dependency Treebank. For the
time being, we are concerned with coreference relations
in their narrower sense, i.e. not covering the so-called
bridging anaphora (for a possibility to cover also the lat-
ter phenomenon, see (Bo?hmova?, 2004)).
In the Prague Dependency Treebank, coreference is
understood as an asymmetrical binary relation between
nodes of a TGTS (not necessarily the same TGTS), or,
as the case may be, as a relation between a node and
an entity that has no corresponding counterpart in the
TGTS(s). The node from which the coreferential link
leads, is called an anaphor, and the node, to which the
link leads, is called an antecedent.
The present scenario of the PDT provides three coref-
erential attributes: coref, cortype and corlemma. The at-
tribute coref contains the identifier of the antecedent; if
there are more than one antecedents of one anaphor, the
attribute coref includes a sequence of identifiers of the
relevant antecedents; since every node of a TGTS has an
identifier of its own it is a simple programming task to
select the specific information on the antecedent. The at-
tribute cortype includes the information on the type of
coreference (the possible values are gram for grammat-
ical and text for textual coreference), or a sequence of
the types of coreference, where each element of cortype
corresponds to an element of coref. The attribute cor-
lemma is used for cases of a coreference between a node
and an entity that has no corresponding counterpart in the
TGTS(s): for the time being, there are two possible val-
ues of this attribute, namely segm in the case of a coref-
erential link to a whole segment of the preceding text (not
just a sentence), and exoph in the case of an exophoric
relation. Cases of reference difficult to be identified even
if the situation is taken into account are marked by the
assignment of unsp as the lemma of the anaphor. This
does not mean that a decision is to be made between two
or more referents but that the reference cannot be fully
specified even within a broader context.
In order to facilitate the task of the annotators and
to make the resulting structures more transparent and
telling, the coreference relations are captured by arrows
leading from the anaphor to the antecedent and the types
of coreference are distinguished by different colors of the
arrows. There are certain notational devices used in cases
when the antecedent is not within the co-text (exophoric
coreference) or when the link should lead to a whole seg-
ment rather than to a particular node. If the anaphor
corefers to more than a single node or to a subtree, the
link leads to the closest preceding coreferring node (sub-
tree). If there is a possibility to choose between a link to
an antecedent or to a postcedent, the link always leads to
the antecedent.

The manual annotation is made user-friendly by a spe-
cial module within the TRED editor (Hajic? et al, 2001b)
which is being used for all three subareas of annotation.
In the case of coreference, an automatic pre-selection of
nodes relevant for annotation is used, making the process
faster.
Until now, about 30,000 sentences have been annotated
as for the above types of coreference relations. One of the
advantages of a corpus-based study of a language phe-
nomenon is that the researchers become aware of sub-
tleties and nuances that are not apparent. For those who
attempt at a corpus annotation, of course, it is necessary
to collect a list of open questions which have a temporary
solution but which should be studied more intensively
and to a greater detail in the future.
Another issue the study of which is significant and
can be facilitated by an availability of a semantically an-
notated corpus, is the question of a (finite) mechanism
the listener (reader) can use to identify the referents. If
the backbone of such a mechanism is seen in the hierar-
chy (partial ordering) of salience, then it can be under-
stood that this hierarchy typically is modified by the flow
of discourse in a way that was specified and illustrated
by (Hajic?ova?, 1993), (Hajic?ova? et al, in prep). In the
flow of a discourse, prototypically, a new discourse ref-
erent emerges as corresponding to a lexical occurrence
that carries f; further occurrences carry t or c, their ref-
erents being primarily determined by their degrees of
salience, although the difference between the lowest de-
grees of salience reduction, is not decisive. It appears to
be possible to capture at least certain aspects of this hi-
erarchy by some (still tentative) heuristic rules, which tie
up the increase/decrease of salience with the position of
the given item in the topic or in the focus of the given ut-
terance. It should also be remarked that there are certain
permanently salient referents, which may be referred to
by items in topic (as ?given? information) without having
a referentially identical antecedent in the discourse. We
denote them as carrying t or c, but perhaps it would be
more adequate to consider them as being always able to
be accommodated
(i) by the utterance itself, as especially the indexicals
(I, you, here, now, yesterday,. . . ),
(ii) by the given culture (democracy, Paris, Shake-
speare, don Quijote,. . . ), by universal human expe-
rience (sun, sky), or
(iii) by the general domain concerned (history, biol-
ogy,...).
Since every node in the PDT carries one of the TFA
values (t, c or f) from which the appurtenance of the
given item to the topic or focus of the whole sentence
can be determined, it will be possible to use the PDT
data and the above heuristics to start experiments with
an automatic assignment of coreferential relations and
check them against the data with the manual annotation
of coreference.
2.4 Lexical Semantics
The design of the tectogrammatical representation is such
that the nodes in the tectogrammatical tree structure rep-
resent (almost) only the autosemantic words found in the
written or spoken utterance they represent. We believe
that it is thus natural to start distinguishing word senses
only at this level (and not on a lower level, such as surface
syntax or linearized text).
Moreover, there is a close relation between valency
and word senses. We hypothesize that with a suitable
set of dependency relations (both inner participants and
free modifications, see Sect. 2.1), there is only one va-
lency frame per word sense (even though synonyms or
near synonyms might have different valency frames). The
opposite is not true: there can be several word senses with
an identical valency frame.
Although in the detailed valency lexicon VALLEX
(Lopatkova?, 2003), (Lopatkova? et al, 2003) an attempt
has originally been made to link the valency frames to
(Czech) EuroWordNet (Pala and ?Sevec?ek, 1999) senses
to prove this point, this has been abandoned for the time
being because of the idiosyncrasies in WordNet design,
which does not allow to do so properly.
We thus proceed independently with word sense an-
notation based on the Czech version of WordNet. Cur-
rently, we have annotated 10,000 sentences with word
senses, both nouns and verbs. We are assessing now fur-
ther directions in annotation; due to low inter-annotator
agreement, we will probably tend to annotate only over a
preselected subset of the WordNet synsets. An approach
to building semantic lexicons that is more related to our
concept of meaning representation is being prepared in
the meantime (Holub and Stran?a?k, 2003).
3 Conclusions
Up to now, the framework has been checked on a large
amount of running text segments from the Czech Na-
tional Corpus (as for the valency classification 55,000 ut-
terances, as for the topic-focus structure 20,000 ones). In
several cases, it was found that a more detailed classifi-
cation is needed (e.g. with the differentiation of the Gen-
eral Actor vs. Unspecified, cf. the difference between
One can cook well with this oven and At this pub they
cook well). However, it has been confirmed that good
results can be achieved with the chosen classification of
about 40 valency types and of 15 other grammatical at-
tribute types (such as (Semantic) Number, Tense, Modal-
ities, etc., but also different values of Location, such as
those corresponding to the preferred functions of in, at,
on, under, over, etc., or of Benefactive (positive vs. neg-
ative), and so on). It can be supposed that the core of
language corresponds to underlying sentence structures
and to their unmarked morphemic and phonemic coun-
terparts. The marked layers have to be described by spe-
cific sets of rules, most of which concern irregularities
of morphemics, including differences between the under-
lying order of nodes and the surface (morphemic) word
order, especially in cases in which the latter does not di-
rectly meet the condition of projectivity (with no cross-
ing of edges, cf. the discontinuous constituents of other
frameworks).
The prototypical varieties of sentence structure can
thus be characterized by projective rooted trees, which
points to the possibility to describe the core of language
structure on the basis of a maximally perspicuous pat-
tern that comes close to patterns present in other domains
(primitive logic, arithmetics, and so on) which are nor-
mally mastered by children. Structures of this kind are
not only appropriate for computer implementation, but
they also help understand the relative easiness of mas-
tering the mother tongue, without a necessity to assume
complex innate mechanisms specific for the language fac-
ulty.
