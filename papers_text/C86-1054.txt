goals. The value t of this threshold is indivldual 
for each agent in different communicative situation. 
The values of these indices are generated under 
the influence of different psychological, ethical, 
pragmatical and other factors. The degree of 
impor tance  o f  each  fac tor  i s  determined by 
ind iv idua l  character i s t i cs  o f  each  agent  and may 
vary  dur ing  the  L I -p rocess .  Hence the  va lues  o f  
re levancy  ind ices  may a lso  vary .  
We consider interpersonal communication as 
j o in t  ac t iv i ty  o f  LI agents  (X and  Y) .  Each agent  
has  h i s  own p lan  o f  behav iour  wh ich  i s  represented  
here  by a sys tem of  goa ls  (G.X or  G .V) ,  i .e .cer ta in  
pragmat ic  and  communicat ive  tasks  to  be rea l i zed .  
The sys tem of  goa ls  o f  the  agent ,  fo r  ins tance ,G.X ,  
may contain both the goals initiated by X himself 
and the goals initiated by his partner Y. Formation 
of the system of goals by the agent X is associated 
with the twu following communicative metagoais: 
-kl is an inclusion of a goal g into the 
par tner ' s  system of  goa ls  G.Y; 
--k2 i s  an  inc lus ion  o f  a goa l  g in to  X 's  own 
sys tem of  goals G.X. 
Language in teract ion  i s  cons idered  as  a process  
a imed at  accompl i sh ing  one o f  these  metagoa ls .  Each 
agent  chooses  a mode o f  ach iev ing  metagoa ls  iu  
response  to  soc ia l l y  determined re la t ions  between 
him and h is  par tner .  These  re la t ions  are  descr ibed  
by a sys tem o f  cont racts  ( \ [1 \ ] , \ [2 \ ] , \ [3 \ ] ) .  In  th i s  
paper  we propose  a fo rmal  descr ip t ion  o f  some 
e lementary  cont racts  fo rmed by combinat ion  o f  bas ic  
re la t ions  between the  par tners .  
2. THE SYSTEM OF RELEVANCY INDICES. 
In o rder  to  descr ibe  agents '  pos i t ions  w i th  
respect  to  a potent ia l  goa l  g we in t roduce  three  
ind ices  be ing  ind iv idua l  fo r  each  agent :  
- INT(X ,g)  i s  a degree  o f  X ' s  in teres t  
(necess i ty ,  des i rab i l i ty )  in  ach iev ing  t i le  goa l  g; 
th i s  index  may be e i ther  pos i t ive  or  negat ive ;  
-CST(X ,g)  i s  a cos t  o f  ach iev ing  t i le  goa l  g ,  
i .e .  the  e f fo r ts  to  be made by X fo r  ach iev ing  g;  
th i s  index  i s  a lways  pos i t ive ;  
-BEN(X,g)  i s  a benef i t  wh ich  may be der ived  by 
X f rom ach iev ing  g;  BEN(X ,g)=INT(X ,g) -CST(X ,g) .  
We cons ider  some thresho ld  t wh ich , in  genera l  
case ,  shouh l  be exceeded by BEN(X,g) (BEN(X,g}>t)  
fo r  inc lud ing  the  goa l  g in to  the  X 's  sys tem of  
3. DOMINATION AND DEPENDENCY 
3.1 .  In o rder  to  map cont racts  onto  
communicat ive  leve l  o f  the  LI we in t roduce  severa l  
types  o f  e lementary  cont racts  fo rmed by combinat ion  
o f  bas ic  dominat ion  cud  dependency  re la t ions  between 
the  par tners .  These  re la t ions  cont ro l  over  the  
process  o f  fo rming  the  sys tem o f  goa ls ,  i .e .  they  
in f luence  upon the  cho ice  o f  the  mode o f  ach iev ing  
the  metagoa ls .  The dominat ion  re la t ion  f i xes  LI 
agent ' s  " r ights"  and "dut ies"  in  ach iev ing  metagoa l  
k l ,  i . e .  in  inc lud ing  a goa l  in to  the  par tner ' s  
sys tem o f  goa ls .  Dependency  cont ro l s  over  ach iev ing  
the  metagoa l  k2.  The " r ights"  and  "dut ies"  o f  the  
agent  in  the  process  o f  goa l  fo rmat ion  are  
represented  by a set  o f  ru les  known to  both  the  
agents .  These  ru les  be long  to  a set  M wh ich  
represents  the  agents '  mutua l ly  coord inated  be l ie fs  
about  the  wor ld .  
3 .2 .  E lementary  cont racts  o f  the  f i r s t  type  are  
based  on the  dominat ion  o f  X over  Y fo r  a l l  the  
goa ls  o f  the  c lass  G ' .  Th is  re la t ion  a l lows  X to  
ob l ige  Y to  inc lude  any  goa l  g~G'  in to  Y ' s  sys tem 
of  goa ls ,  i f  the  propos i t ion  BEN(Y ,g)>t l  be longs  to  
tbe  set  M, t l  be ing  the  minimum va lue  o f  index  
BEN(Y,g) wh ich  i s  necessary  fo r  X to  ach ieve  the  
metagoa l  k l=(gEG.Y . ) .  1'he va lue  o f  t l  i s  determined 
by the  who le  complex  o f  const i tuents  o f  complete  
cont ract  wh ich  determines  the  leve l  o f  cooperat ion ,  
i .e . the  degree  o f  coord inat ion  o f  agents '  ac t ions ,  
co inc idence  or  conf l i c t  o f  the i r  in teres ts .  So, 
p rov ided  that  (X>Y,G ' , t l ) ,  g~G'  and  BEN(Y ,g)>t l ,  i t  
i s  su f f i c ient  fo r  X to  le t  Y know o f  metagoa l  k l=  
(g~G.Y)  be ing  inc luded in  the  sys tem G.X fo r  the  
goa l  g to  be inc luded in to  the  Y ' s  sys tem o f  goa ls .  
The second type  o f  e lementary  cont racts  i s  
character i zed  by t i le absence  o f  dominat ion  o f  X over  
Y (X~Y,G',t2): in general case it is not sufficient 
for X to let Y know of metagoal k I=(gEG.Y)  being 
included in G.X. For X another way of achieving kl 
based on the  va lues  o f  some other  const i tuents  o f  
the  cont ract  shou ld  be chosen .  
3 .3 .  E lementary  cont racts  wb ich  regu la te  
ach ievement  o f  t i le  metagoa l  k2 are  based  on the  
dependency  re la t ion :  (X<Y,G ' , t3 )  . I f  X depends  on 
Y, i t  i s  necessary  fo r  him to  get  Y ' s  permiss ion  fo r  
inc lus ion  o f  a goa l  g~S '  in to  the  X 's  sys tem of  
goa ls ,  o r  the  propos i t ion  BEN(Y ,g~G.X)>t3  shou ld  
be long  to  the  set  M, where  t3  i s  the  necessary  
va lue  o f  index  BEN fo r  V to  inc lude  a goa l  in to  h i s  
sys tem o f  goa ls .

The absence  o f  dependency  (X~Y,G ' , t4 )  a l lows  X 
to  inc lude  any  goa l  g66 '  in to  h i s  sys tem of  goa ls  
without Y's permission. But the index BEN(Y,g~G.X)  
has to exceed the value t4 being determined by the 
level of cooperation between the partners. 
3.4. The basic *'elations aren' t  mutually 
exclusive or interdependent: the domination of X 
over Y in the class G' doesn't exclude the domina- 
tion of Y over X in the same class G' and doesn't 
presuppose the Y's dependency on X. The complete 
contract includes decomposition of the set of poten- 
tial goals into classes, for each of which the given 
relations are defined on the part of X as well as on 
the part of Y, 
4.  NEUTRALITY, COOPERATION AND CONFLICT 
4.l.Basie relations reflect certain social and 
psychological roles of the LI agents. The absence of 
these relations between the partners leaves the 
modes of achieving the metagoals to LI agents' 
choice. These modes are divided into three groups, 
according to the degree of mutually accounting for 
each other's intercs?s. These groups determine three 
types of contracts: neutral, cooperative and 
conflicting ones. There exists the follwing set of 
modes: admissibil ity/inadmissibil ity of deformation 
of the basic relations, possibility of reciprocal 
concessions, usage of  additional information 
stimulating a successful achievement of the agent's 
goal. This stimulus may be positive (plus-stimulus) 
or negative (minus-stimulus). 
4,2 .  The neutral contract presupposes the 
inadmissibility of deformation of  tile basic 
relations. 
In case of absence of domination of X over Y 
(X~Y,G',t2) it is necessary for X to make Y be 
interested in achievement of a goal gE  G' for 
realizing the metagoal k I=(E6G.Y) ,  i.e. to make the 
value of index BEN(Y,g) > t2. Neutral contracts 
allows X to use one of two possible means: a) to let 
Y know of some information increasing the value of 
the index BEN(Y,g); and b) to let Y know of a goal 
g' being included in the X's system of goals, with 
BEN(Y,g')+BEN(Y,g)>t2. Provided that the proposition 
BEN(Y,g)<t2 belongs to the set M and it is 
impossible fur X to use one of the two means 
mentioned above, X has to give up the meta- 
goal k l=(g~G.Y) .  
In case of (X~Y,G',t4) the neutral contract 
commits X to take Y's interests into account. X may 
include a goal g into G.X if this goal is harmless 
for Y (INT (Y,g)>O). If the value of the index 
INT(Y,g) is negative, it is necessary for X to 
guarantee some compensation for presupposed damage, 
i.e. to include a goal g' into G.X. with BEN(Y, 
g~ G.X)+BEN(Y,g' 6 O.X)>t4. Otherwise X has to give 
his goal g up. 
So neutral contracts provide the accomplishment 
of the metagoals by means of basic relations and by 
using plus-stimuli. 
4.3. Cooperative contracts are characterized by 
rec iproca l  "c red i t " ,  i .e .  mutua l  concess ions  are  
poss ib le .  Each agent  may a l low in f r ingement  o f  h i s  
in teres ts .  The degree  o f  in f r ingement  i s  determined 
by the  leve l  o f  cooperat ion  and  i s  f i xed  in  the  
va lues  t i  o f  re levancy  ind ices .  Cooperat ive  
cont racts  a l low modi f i ca t ion  o f  bas ic  re la t ions ,  i t  
i s  poss ib le  fo r  any  agent  not  to  do h i s  duty  or  to  
230 
exceed,  h i s  r ights .  
In  case  o f  X>Y the  inc lus ion  o f  a goa l  in to  the  
sys tem G.Y i s  poss ib le  i f  the  va lue  o f  the  index  
CST(V,g)  i s  fa r  less  than  t5  and the  va lue  o f  t i le  
index BEN(X,g) is more than t6, where t5 and t6 are 
determined by the level of cooperation. If the value 
of index CST(Y,g) is more than t5 but X doesn't give 
up the metagoal k l=(g~G.Y},  then X may use plus- 
stimulus, i.e. compensation of presupposed damage. 
In case of X~Y it is possible for X to achieve 
the metagoal k I=(gEG.Y)  without using any stimulus, 
if the value of the index CST(Y,g) is less than t5 
Provided that CST(Y,g)>t5, X has to use plus- 
stimulus for including the goal g into the G.Y 
system. The partner Y, on his turn, has to include 
the goal g into his system of goals, if CST(Y,g)<t5 
and BEN(X,g)>t6 .  
Cooperat ion  permi ts  the  mod i f i ca t ion  o f  the  
basic relation X<Y, it means that it is possible for 
X to include a goal g into his system of 
goals in spite of the value of the index 
BEN(V,gQG.X)  being less than t2. In other words, Y 
may give permission for X's inclusion of the goal g 
into the system G.X in spite of BEN(Y ,gE  G.X)<t2 
If the value of the index BEN(Y,g~G.X)  is far less 
than t2 then it is necessary for X to use plus- 
stimulus: to promise the inclusion of the 
goal g', with BEN(Y ,gEG.X)+BEN(Y ,g~ G.Y)>t2. 
In case of X<? it is necessary for X to take 
into account Y'x interests: to include a goal with 
INT(Y,g6G.X)>O. Provided that INT(Y,g~G.X)<O, it 
is necessary for X to guarantee compensation for 
success of the metagoal k2=(g~G.X) .  As for ?, it is 
possible for him to a/low some infringement of his 
interests: X may include a goal g into G.X, if the 
value of index BEN(Y,gEG.X)  is not much less than 
t2. In this case X may succeed in achievement of tile 
metagoal k2=(g~G.X)  without using of plus-stimulus. 
4.4. The conflicting contracts allow agents to 
use minus-stimulus and to break tile basic rela- 
tions. 
The break of elementary contracts based on X's 
domination over V is characterized by Y's refusal of 
including the goal g into his system of goals in 
spite of X's demand, if the value of the iadex 
BEN(Y,g) is less than tl. 
As for, X it is possible for him to use a 
minus--stimulus for achieving the metagoal k\]= 
(g~ G,Y) in  both the cases X>V and X}Y. Minus- 
stimulus is X's promise to include a goal g' into 
G.X with BEN(Y,g'E G.X) being far less than t2. This 
promise induces Y to inclade the goal g into G.Y in 
order to avoid accomplishment of the goal g'. Under 
a conflict for achieving the metagoal k2= 
(gE  G.X) it is possible for X not to get Y's 
permission for including a goal g into G.X in both 
tile cases X<Y and X~V. Conflicting contracts allow X 
to include any goal without taking into account Y's 
interests. If it is necessary for X to get Y's 
permission for achieving the goal g, he may use 
minus-stimulus to force assent out of Y. 
5. CONCLUSION 
Above we have discussed certain aspects of 
communicative context of LI: the agents' systems of 
indices of relevancy, basic relations forming 
elementary contracts and three types of contracts 
regulating the process of goal formation. These
