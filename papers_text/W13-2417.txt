Abstract
We propose a method for cross-language
identification of semantic relations based
on word similarity measurement and mor-
phosemantic relations in WordNet. We
transfer these relations to pairs of deriva-
tionally unrelated words and train a model
for automatic classification of new in-
stances of (morpho)semantic relations in
context based on the existing ones and
the general semantic classes of collocated
verb and noun senses. Our experiments
are based on Bulgarian-English parallel
and comparable texts but the method is to
a great extent language-independent and
particularly suited to less-resourced lan-
guages, since it does not need parsed or se-
mantically annotated data. The application
of the method leads to an increase in the
number of discovered semantic relations
by 58.35% and performs relatively consis-
tently, with a small decrease in precision
between the baseline (based on morphose-
mantic relations identified in wordnet) ?
0.774, and the extended method (based on
the data obtained through machine learn-
ing) ? 0.721.
1 Introduction
Natural language semantics has begun to receive
due attention as many areas of natural language
processing have recognized the need for address-
ing both the syntactic structure and the semantic
representation of sentence constituents. Modelling
conceptual and syntactic relationships such as se-
mantic roles, semantic and syntactic frames, or
semantic and syntactic dependencies is known as
semantic role labeling ? SRL (Gildea and Juraf-
sky, 2002), (shallow) semantic parsing (Pradhan et
al., 2004), semantic role tagging (Xue and Palmer,
2004), extraction of predicate-argument structures
(Moschitti and Bejan, 2004), automatic extraction
of semantic relations (Swier and Stevenson, 2005),
among others.
We propose a method for automatic semantic
labeling based on the morphosemantic relations
in Princeton WordNet (PWN). A morphoseman-
tic relation associates a verb synset Sv and a noun
synset Sn if there is a derivational relation between
a literal Lv in Sv and a literal Ln in Sn. Mor-
phosemantic relations inherit the semantics of the
derivation. Consider, for instance, the morphose-
mantic relations agent, instrument, location, and
vehicle, which link a verb to its agent (adminis-
trate ? administrator), instrument (collide ? col-
lider), location (settle ? settlement), vehicle (bomb
? bomber).
We apply word and clause similarity measure-
ment to parallel and comparable texts in order to
perform partial word sense disambiguation and to
identify candidates for labeling with semantic in-
formation. We enhance the WordNet morphose-
mantic relations with semantic generalizations de-
rived from the general semantic word classes of
the synsets and use this knowledge to learn and
assign different types of semantic information:
? semantic relations associated with the noun col-
locates of a particular verb sense;
? general semantic noun classes that are eligible
to collocate with a particular verb sense.
We apply this method to English and Bulgarian
using PWN and the Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet).
An advantage of the proposed approach is that it is
able to assign semantic labels to unstructured text.
The paper is organised as follows. We out-
line the background against which we approach
the identification of semantic relations in Section
2 where we present in brief groundbreaking and
influential recent work in semantic role labeling
(SRL). In Section 3 we discuss the linguistic mo-
tivation for the proposed approach. In Section 4
119
we describe the method for wordnet-based iden-
tification of semantic information and its imple-
mentation. Section 5 presents assessment of the
results, followed by conclusions and an outline of
directions for future research in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Many applications treat the assignment of seman-
tic roles, semantic frames, and dependencies as
a classification problem that involves the training
of models on (large) manually annotated corpora,
such as FrameNet text annotation (Ruppenhofer et
al., 2010), the Prague Dependency Treebank (Ha-
jic, 1998), or PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005), and
the subsequent assignment of semantic labels to
appropriate sentence constituents.
A number of models have been developed us-
ing the FrameNet corpus. Undoubtedly the most
influential one has been Gildea and Jurafsky?s
machine learning method (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002), which is based on the training of a SRL
classifier on a set of lexical, morpho-syntactic,
syntactic and word order features extracted from
the parsed FrameNet corpus in conjunction with
knowledge of the predicates, prior probabilities of
various combinations of semantic roles, etc.
PropBank spurred a lot of research in SRL
(Pradhan et al, 2004; Pradhan et al, 2008;
Toutanova et al, 2008; Surdeanu et al, 2003; Xue
and Palmer, 2004), to mention but a few. For in-
stance, Pradhan et al (2004) and Pradhan et al
(2008) propose SRL algorithms that augment pre-
viously developed systems, such as Gildea and Ju-
rafsky?s (2002) by replacing earlier classifiers with
SVMs. Xue and Palmer (2004) train a Maximum
Entropy classifier on the PropBank using linguis-
tic features that can be directly extracted from syn-
tactic parse trees and achieve results comparable to
the best performing system at the time (Pradhan et
al., 2004).
Semantic role labeling based on (large) anno-
tated corpora need to deal with a number of issues,
such as the situation specificity of semantic roles,
the manual selection of annotated examples, vari-
ability in the sets of roles used across the compu-
tational resources, among others (Marquez et al,
2008). Pradhan et al (2008) have also shown that
the transfer of such models to other domains leads
to substantial degradation in the results.
Some researchers employ other resources as an
alternative. Swier and Stevenson (2005) describe
an unsupervised SRL system that combines infor-
mation from a verb lexicon ? VerbNet with a sim-
ple probability model. Shi and Mihalcea (2005)
propose the integration of VerbNet, WordNet and
FrameNet into a knowledge base and use it in the
building of a semantic parser. The system iden-
tifies the FrameNet frame best corresponding to
a parsed sentence either as a direct match, or via
VerbNet and/or WordNet relations.
Despite these alternatives the dominant trend
has remained the corpus-based SRL, with un-
supervised approaches gaining popularity as a
way of overcoming the deficiencies of supervised
methods (Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Lang and Lap-
ata, 2011b), among others. Syntactic analysis has
been considered a prerequisite in SRL, with full
parsing winning over partial parsing, as demon-
strated by the results in the CoNLL-2004 (Carreras
and Marquez, 2004) and the CoNLL-2005 (Car-
reras and Marquez, 2005) shared tasks. Syntac-
tic analysis and SRL have been dealt with within
two general frameworks. In the ?pipeline? ap-
proach the systems first perform syntactic pars-
ing followed by SRL, while In the joint parsing
approach syntactic and semantic parsing are per-
formed together. Joint parsing of syntactic and
semantic dependencies has been the focus of the
CoNLL-2008 (Surdeanu et al, 2008) and CoNLL-
2009 (Hajic? et al, 2009) shared tasks.
To sum up, a classical SRL system takes a
parsed input and assigns semantic roles on the
basis of: i) a language model learnt from a pre-
annotated semantically labeled corpus; ii) a frame
lexicon; or iii) a combination of different re-
sources. In the systems using annotated corpora
the syntactically parsed sentences are usually se-
mantically annotated using classifiers trained on
the corpus on the basis of linguistic features de-
rived from the parses. In the case of lexicon-based
systems semantic roles are directly or indirectly
assigned from the lexicon.
3 Motivation
Morphosemantic relations in WordNet denote re-
lations between (synset members) that are similar
in meaning and where one word is derived from
the other by means of a morphological affix (Fell-
baum et al, 2009). The authors also note that most
of the morphosemantic relations connect words
from different classes and go on to demonstrate
that part of the noun-verb relations correspond to
120
semantic roles. In fact, many of the noun-verb
morphosemantic links in WordNet designate typi-
cal relations between a participant and a predicate,
such as agent, instrument, material, location, un-
dergoer, destination, etc.
For instance the verb literal send (cause to be
directed or transmitted to another place) is re-
lated to the noun sender (someone who transmits
a message) through the morphosemantic relation
agent and to the noun sendee (the intended recip-
ient of a message) through destination; train (ed-
ucate for a future role or function) is connected to
trainer (one who trains other persons or animals)
through agent and to trainee (someone who is be-
ing trained) through undergoer. The noun mem-
bers of these morphosemantic relations can func-
tion as arguments of the particular verbs and bear
the respective semantic roles, i.e. agent for sender
and trainer, destination for sendee, and undergoer
for trainee.
Further, we assume that if a noun and a verb
enter into the same morphosemantic relation in-
dividually, they are licensed for it and therefore,
when they collocate, they enter into this relation
if there is no other appropriate noun candidate for
the same relation. As an example, consider the
sentence: The author used the method of cost-
effectiveness analysis. The verb use is linked to
user through the morphosemantic relation agent.
The noun author is connected with the verb author
(be the author of) by means of the same relation.
By virtue of the above assumption we assign the
relation agent between use and author in this par-
ticular sentence. In such a way the morphoseman-
tic relation identified between the derivationally
related verb and noun may be inherited by syn-
onyms, direct hypernyms, hyponyms, sister terms,
etc. Thus, given a morphosemantic relation and
words in the context that participate in such a re-
lation independently of each other, we are able to
discover certain types of semantic relations.
4 Method for Cross-Language Learning
of Semantic Relations
The goal of the study is to identify semantic rela-
tions between a verb and collocated nouns1 within
similar clauses in Bulgarian and English (often
but not necessarily translational equivalents) and
to assign a semantic matrix to the verb based on
1Collocated here means that nouns are found within the
same clause as the verb.

which is an excerpt from the Bulgarian National
Corpus (Koeva et al, 2012).
4.1 WordNet Enhancement with
Morphosemantic Relations
The interest in morphosemantic relations has been
motivated by the fact that they overlap to a great
extent across wordnets (Bilgin et al, 2004) and
thus improve the internal connectivity of the in-
dividual wordnets, as well as by the fact that the
derivational subnets reflect certain cognitive struc-
tures in natural languages (Pala and Hlavackova,
2007). n approach to wordnet development based
on enrichment with morphosemantic relations has
been adopted for English (Fellbaum et al, 2009),
as well as for a number of other languages ? Turk-
ish (Bilgin et al, 2004), Czech (Pala and Hlavack-
ova, 2007), Bulgarian (Koeva et al, 2008), Serbian
(Koeva, 2008), Polish (Piasecki et al, 2009), Ro-
manian (Barbu Mititelu, 2012), to mention a few.
Provided there is a mapping algorithm between
two or more wordnets, such as the cross-language
relation of equivalence between synsets (Vossen,
2004), a morphosemantic relation between a pair
of synsets in a given language can be mapped
to the corresponding synsets in a different lan-
121
guage, even if the latter language does not exhibit
a derivational relation between members of these
particular synsets.
We automatically expand BulNet with mor-
phosemantic relations in the following two ways:
(1) Morphosemantic relations are mapped from
the morphosemantic database distributed with the
PWN2 to the corresponding Bulgarian synsets.
The morphosemantic relations currently encoded
in Princeton WordNet 3.0.3 have relatively limited
coverage ? 14,876 verb-noun synset pairs, which
involve 7,960 verb synsets and 9,704 noun synsets.
The automatic transfer of morphosemantic links to
BulNet resulted in the association of 5,002 verb-
noun pairs involving 3,584 verb synsets and 4,938
noun synsets.
For example, the PWN synset hammer:2 (beat
with or as if with a hammer) is related to the noun
synset hammer:4 (a hand tool with a heavy rigid
head and a handle; used to deliver an impulsive
force by striking) through the morphosemantic re-
lation instrument. We map this relation to the
corresponding pair in BulNet ? the verb synset
chukam:1; kova:1 and the noun synset chuk:1. In
the particular case a derivational relation exists in
Bulgarian, as well, between chuk and chukam.
(2) In general, the task of detection and clas-
sification of the identified relations includes au-
tomatic generation of derivational pairs based on
knowledge of language-specific derivational pat-
terns followed by filtering of the results through
automatic and/or manual validation. Specific
methods are described in more detail in the re-
search cited at the beginning of this subsection, as
well as in more recent proposals, such as the ma-
chine learning approach to generation and classifi-
cation of derivational pairs made by Piasecki et al
(2012b) and Piasecki et al (2012a), respectively.
We identify new pairs of verb-noun literals in
BulNet that are potentially derivationally (and thus
morphosemantically) related by means of a set of
rules that describe the verb-noun and noun-verb
derivational patterns in Bulgarian (we focus on
patterns affecting the end of the word, thus ig-
noring prefixation) and assign the respective mor-
phosemantic relations to the synsets that include
the related pairs.

We identified 89 derivational noun endings
(morphophonemic variants of suffixes) and 183
derivational patterns (verb ending to noun ending
correspondences), and associated them with the
morphosemantic relation they indicate. Only 39
of the selected derivational endings were found to
be unambiguous. Moreover, many of them proved
to be highly ambiguous, denoting up to 10 of the
14 morphosemantic relations. In order to disam-
biguate at least partially the possible morphose-
mantic relations associated with a particular suf-
fix, we filtered those meanings with the general
semantic classes derived from the PWN lexicog-
rapher files. The PWN synsets are organized in
45 lexicographer files based on syntactic category
and general semantic word classes (26 for nouns
and 15 for verbs)4.
For instance, the Bulgarian noun suffix -
nik is associated with the following relations
agent, instrument, location, undergoer, and event.
By virtue of the fact that the synsets denot-
ing locations are found in the lexicographer file
noun.location, the synset denoting agents
? in noun.person, and the instruments ? in
noun.artifact, we were able to disambiguate
the suffix at least partially.
Initially, 57,211 new derivational relations were
found in BulNet. These relations were eval-
uated automatically on the basis of the mor-
phosemantic relations transferred from PWN.
Each triple <verb.label, noun.label,
relation>5 was assigned a probability based
on the frequency of occurrence in the set of
morphosemantic relations transferred from PWN.
Those relations with a probability below 1% were
filtered out. As a result 34,677 morphosemantic
relations between a noun literal and a verb lit-
eral were assigned among 7,456 unique noun-verb
synset pairs, which involved 2,537 verb synsets
and 1,708 noun synsets.
For example the noun synset kovach:1 (corre-
sponding to blacksmith:1) is derivationally related
with the verb literal kova:1 through the suffix -ach,
which is associated either with an agent or with an
instrument relation depending on the semantics of
the noun ? a person or an inanimate object. In this
case the meaning of the suffix is disambiguated

man/lexnames.5WN.html
5The verb.label and noun.label are descriptive
labels of the wordnet synsets which are listed in the respective
lexicographer files.
122
by virtue of the fact that kovach:1 is found in the
noun.person lexicographer file. We link the
literals kova:1 and kovach:1 via a derivational re-
lation suffix and assign the synsets the morphose-
mantic relation agent.
4.2 Preprocessing and Clause Splitting
The preprocessing of the Bulgarian-English cor-
pus used in the study includes sentence-splitting,
tokenization, POS-tagging and lemmatization, us-
ing the Bulgarian Language Processing Chain6
(Koeva and Genov, 2011) for the Bulgarian part
and Stanford CoreNLP7 for the English part.
The clause serves as the minimal context for
the realization of verb semantics, and hence ?
the scope within which we carry out the cross-
linguistic analysis and the assignment of relations.
Clause splitting is applied using a general method
based on POS tagging, lists of clause delimiters
(clause linking words, multiword expressions, and
punctuation) and a set of language-specific rules.
We define the clause as a sequence of words be-
tween two potential clause delimiters where ex-
actly one predicate (a simple or a complex verb
form, which may be a lexical verb, an auxiliary,
a copula, or a combination of a lexical verb or
a copula with one or more auxiliaries) occurs.
We identify the predicates in each sentence us-
ing language-specific rules for Bulgarian and En-
glish. Each clause is labeled by a clause opening
and a clause end. The clause splitting algorithm
marks subordinating and coordinating clause link-
ing words and phrases and punctuation clause de-
limiters. If no clause boundary has been identified
between two predicates, a clause boundary is in-
serted before the second one. The nested clauses
are detected, as well.
4.3 Word-to-Word and Text-to-Text
Semantic Similarity
WordNet has inspired the elaboration of metrics
for word similarity and relatedness that quantify
the degree to which words (concepts) are related
using properties of the WordNet structure. The
so-called path-length based measures rely on the
length of the path between two nodes (synsets),
possibly normalized. For instance, the Leacock-
Chodorow metric (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998)
finds the shortest path between two concepts and
6http://dcl.bas.bg/services/
7http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/
corenlp.shtml
scales the path length by the overall depth D of the
WordNet taxonomy, while Wu-Palmer (Wu and
Palmer, 1994) calculates the depth of the concepts
and their least common subsumer in the WordNet
taxonomy.
Information content based metrics augment the
path information with corpus statistics. Resnik
(1995) measures the similarity of two concepts by
calculating the information content (IC) of their
least common subsumer (LCS). Jiang-Conrath
(Jiang and Conrath, 1997) and Lin (Lin, 1998)
combine the information content of the LCS with
the information content of the individual concepts.
Several relatedness metrics have also been pro-
posed, such as Hirst-St-Onge (Hirst and St-Onge,
1998), which measures semantic relatedness based
on the path length and its nature (the changes of di-
rection in the path), and the algorithms proposed
by Banerjee and Pederson (2002) and Patwardhan
et al (2003), which rely on information obtained
from the synsets glosses.
A number of researchers have addressed WSD
based on cross-lingual semantic similarity mea-
surement, such as the application of monolingual
WSD graph-based algorithms to multilingual co-
occurrence graphs based on WordNet (Silberer
and Ponzetto, 2010), or of multilingual WSD al-
gorithms based on multilingual knowledge from
BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012).
For the purposes of the extraction of seman-
tic relations we are interested in corresponding
pairs of clauses in Bulgarian and English satisfy-
ing the following conditions: (a) the verbs in the
clauses are similar (with respect to a certain simi-
larity measure and threshold); and (b) the clauses
are similar in meaning (with respect to a certain
similarity measure and threshold). Similar pairs
of verbs and nouns are identified on the basis of
the Wu-Palmer word-to-word similarity measure
(Wu and Palmer, 1994). Clause similarity is com-
puted by means of the text similarity measurement
proposed by Mihalcea et al (2006).
Measuring semantic similarity cross-
linguistically enables us to filter some of the
senses of a particular word in one language since
potential semantic similarity of words within
similar clauses strongly suggests that these words
are semantically related ? translation equivalents,
close synonyms, hypernyms, or hyponyms.
In the application of the method described in
Section 4.4, we assign semantic relations to the el-
123
ements of similar clauses in a comparable, not nec-
essarily parallel, Bulgarian-English corpus. More-
over, we identify semantically similar rather than
parallel clauses, which enables us to experiment
with a greater number and diversity of contexts for
the identification of semantic relations.
4.4 Method outline
We select corresponding (comparable) pairs of
texts from the corpus ? T1 in Bulgarian and T2 in
English on the basis of their detailed metadata de-
scription (Koeva et al, 2012), including parame-
ters such as style, domain and genre. For each pair
of corresponding texts T1 and T2 we apply the fol-
lowing algorithm:
Step 1. We identify semantically similar pairs
of verbs and consider similarity between their re-
spective clauses ? v1 ? cl1 and v2 ? cl2, where
cl1 ? T1 and cl2 ? T2 and cl1 are also seman-
tically similar (cf. Section 4.3 for word-to-word
and clause-to-clause similarity).
Step 2. We identify semantically similar pairs
of collocated nouns in the bi-clause (cl1, cl2) in
the same way as for verbs.
Step 3. We assign morphosemantic relations
to the verb and its collocated nouns using the en-
hanced set of relations (cf. Section 4.1) and map
all matching candidates (v1, n1, rel) in cl1(v1)
and (v2, n2, rel) in cl(v2).
Step 4. Since co-occurrence of members of a
single instance of a morphosemantic relation are
relatively rare, we transfer the morphosemantic re-
lations to non-derivationally related words, pro-
vided a noun and a verb participate in the same
type of morphosemantic relation independently of
each other. In Example 1 the noun director en-
ters into a morphosemantic relation (agent) with
the verb direct, while the verb send enters inde-
pendently into the same type of relation with the
noun sender. Since both director and send are li-
censed for agent, we assign the relation.
Example 1.
Croatian director Zrinko Ogresta sent an invita-
tion for the international film festival.
send, 01437254-v, verb.contact
{to cause or order to be taken directed or transmit-
ted to another place}
director, 10015215-n, noun.person
VERB send: agent, NOUN director: agent inv
Step 5. We hierarchize the candidates for a
particular morphosemantic relation and select the
most probable one based on the general semantic
word classes (verb.label and noun.label)
and the relations they participate in. Where two or
more morphosemantic relations are assigned be-
tween a pair of words, priority is given to the re-
lation which is most compatible with the general
semantic class of the noun in the relation.
Some relations, such as event, are very general
and therefore are not considered even if their prob-
ability is higher, provided a more meaningful rela-
tion is available. Moreover, we incorporate some
syntactic and word-order dependencies. For in-
stance, a noun which is a complement of a prepo-
sitional phrase and is thus found in the following
configurations: p(A)N (with any number of ad-
jectives preceding the noun) is not licensed for the
morphosemantic relation agent if the verb is ac-
tive.
Step 6. Based on the general semantic class of
the noun and/or the verb, some additional poten-
tial relations are added to the respective synsets in
the model (Example 2). For example, a noun be-
longing to the class noun.location can poten-
tially enter into a location relation with the verb,
although the respective noun synset might not en-
ter into this morphosemantic relation.
Example 2. Newly added relations
verb.label role
contact agent
motion location
noun.label role
person agent inv
location location inv
attribute property inv
Step 7. We extend the number of relations by
learning from previous occurrences. Learning is
performed on the News subcorpus (see Table 1),
and further experiments extend the information ac-
quired in the learning phase with data from the en-
tire corpus.
Given a verb is licensed to enter into a particu-
lar morphosemantic relation, we assign this rela-
tion to a co-occurring verb-noun pair, even if the
noun in this pair does not enter into this type of re-
lation, provided other nouns belonging to the same
general semantic class have been observed to co-
occur with this verb. This assumption is general-
ized over all the members of the verb synset and
the noun synset to which the respective verb and
noun belong.
124
Example 3 shows how learning is applied:
based on the occurrences of verbs from the
same synset (ID: 00974367-v, announce:2; de-
clare:2) in a morphosemantic relation of type
agent with nouns belonging to the semantic class
noun.group (in 60.4% of the cases), we asso-
ciate the verb announce with the noun Ministry
(noun.group) through the agent relation de-
spite the fact that Ministry is not linked to any verb
through a morphosemantic relation.
Example 3.
Learned:
Verb ID relation noun.label freq
00974367-v by-means-of noun.artifact 5
00974367-v by-means-of noun.act 14
00974367-v agent noun.person 9
00974367-v agent noun.group 16
The Ministry of Defense announced on Wednesday
its new plans.
announce, 00974367-v, verb.communication
{make known, make an announcement}
Ministry, 08114004-n, noun.group
VERB announce: agent
NOUN Ministry: agent inv
At a next stage of generalization we consider
only the general semantic classes of a verb and a
noun which are candidates to enter in a morphose-
mantic relation. This step relies on the assumption
that verbs from the same semantic class (e.g. per-
ception verbs) show preference to similar semantic
patterns. The learned information is in a general-
ized form, as presented in Example 4.
Example 4. A sample of semantic compatibil-
ity information learned from the News subcorpus.

4.5 Implementation
We implement the word-to-word similarities with
the ws4j package for Java8, which is based on the
original Perl package Wordnet::Similarity
(Pedersen et al, 2007).
We use the Princeton WordNet 3.0 and access it
through Java libraries such as JAWS9 and JWI10.
8https://code.google.com/p/ws4j/
9http://lyle.smu.edu/?tspell/jaws/
10http://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/
api/
We also employ a list of morphosemantic relations
available for WordNet 3.0. The access to BulNet
is modeled roughly on PWN. The corresponding
synsets in the two wordnets are linked by means
of synset IDs.
5 Results and Evaluation
Evaluation was performed with respect to the cov-
erage of the morphosemantic relations, the preci-
sion of the assigned relations, and the informa-
tiveness of the extracted semantic patterns. Test-
ing was carried out on the News subcorpus (Ta-
ble 1) totaling 100,628 tokens distributed in four
subdomains: Politics, Economy, Culture, and Mil-
itary. The corpus comprises 3,362 sentences and
7,535 clauses for Bulgarian and 3,678 sentences
and 8,624 clauses for English.

Table 2: Coverage of relations in the News subcor-
pus using the baseline method (2) and the extended
method (4)
Table 2 presents: (1) the number of mor-
phosemantic relations covered by the baseline 0
method, i.e. applying only the Princeton WordNet
morphosemantic relations; (2) the number of mor-
phosemantic relations after adding those specific
to Bulgarian; and (3, 4) the number of morphose-
mantic relations learnt with the method described
in Step 7 (Section 4.4). The results show that the
extended method leads to an increase in coverage
by 58.35% (compare the extended method (4) with
the baseline (2)).
To assess the precision of the automatic relation
assignment, we performed evaluation on five rela-
tions: agent, undergoer, location, result, and state
(Table 3). The overall precision based on these
relations is 0.774 for the baseline and 0.721 for
the extended method, which shows that the per-
formance of the method is relatively consistent.
We also obtained two types of generalizations
based on WordNet and confirmed by the corpus

Table 3: Precision of the results for five seman-
tic relations ? baseline (Princeton and Bulgarian
morphosemantic relations) and extended method
(transfer of morphosemantic relations to pairs of
nouns and verbs one of which does not participate
in morphosemantic relations)
data that can be used for further classification. The
first one represents the combinatorial properties
of general semantic verb classes with particular
(morpho)semantic relations. For example a verb
of communication is more likely linked to an
agent rather than to a result (Example 5).
Example 5. Frequency of relations in WordNet
and the entire corpus.
verb.label relation fr wn fr cor
verb.com agent 744 555
verb.com undergoer 306 362
verb.com by-means-of 244 560
verb.com result 192 283
Moreover, the nouns that are eligible to collo-
cate as agents with a communication verb belong
to a limited set of classes ? noun.person or
noun.group (Example 6).
Example 6. Frequency of relations in WordNet
and the entire corpus.
verb.label relation noun label fr wn fr cor
verb.com agent noun.person 473 333
verb.com agent noun.group 271 220
The second generalization refers to the prob-
ability of the association of a given verb sense
with a particular set of semantic relations and the
general noun classes eligible for these relations.
For instance, the communication verb order
(Example 7) in the sense of give instructions
to or direct somebody to do something with
authority connects with the highest probability
with an undergoer (noun.person) and an
agent (noun.person).
Example 7. Relations of the verb order in
WordNet and the entire corpus.
verb.label relation noun label fr wn fr cor
verb.com undergoer noun.person 33 8
verb.com agent noun.person 12 6
verb.com by-means-of noun.phen 9 7
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we have explored the applicability
of the morphosemantic relations in WordNet for
cross-language identification of semantic and in
some cases syntactic dependencies between col-
located verbs and nouns. As morphosemantic re-
lations are valid cross-linguistically, the method is
applicable for any language or a pair of languages.
The limitations of the proposed method lie in
the insufficient connectivity of the nodes (synsets
and literals). We have described an approach to
automatic wordnet enhancement, which has re-
sulted in a substantial increase in the number
of morphosemantic relations. Another inherent
weakness is that some of the relations are very
general or vaguely defined. We have addressed
this problem by considering relations jointly with
the general semantic classes associated with the
synsets in WordNet.
The method has the advantage of using lim-
ited linguistic annotation. It does not require text
alignment, syntactic parsing or word-sense disam-
biguation. The cross-linguistic similarity partially
disambiguates the target words, so that the senses
for which the clauses are not similar are discarded;
the semantic restrictions imposed by the general
semantic classes and their compatibility also con-
tribute to semantic disambiguation. The method
is thus to a large extent language-independent and
well suited to less-resourced languages.
In order to improve the performance and over-
come the limitations of the method, we plan to
explore deeper into the possibilities of predicting
the roles of the verb participants from their gen-
eral semantic class and the semantic compatibility
of verb and noun classes, as well as from the com-
patibility of the different types of morphosemantic
relations with the general semantic classes.
Another line of research to pursue in the future
is the application of the proposed method and its
subtasks to other NLP tasks, such as clause split-
ting, alignment based on wordnet relations, ex-
traction of patterns from comparable corpora, and
augmentation and enhancement of training data
for MT.
