The d i s t inc t ion  between u~uderlying and sur face s t ruc ture  
i s  more or less  wel l  es tab l i shed  in  contemporary ~ammat ica l  
ana lys i s .  The form and depth of the under ly iD E s t ruc ture  and 
i t s  re la t ionsh ip  to observab le  language rea l i ty  are,  however, 
permanent ly  in  the focus of l ingu is t i c  d i sputes .  
In  the s tandard  generat ive  ~ranaformat ions l  model 
(Ohc~sky, 1965) under ly inE  s t ruc ture  was moderate ly  deep. I% 
re f lec ted  the sur face  s t ruc ture  of Eng l i sh  and catered  fo r  
semantic  d i s t inc t ions  main ly  through the inherent  senuantic 
features  of the lex icon .  The semantic component, to which the 
der ived sentences  were being sent  fo r  semantic p rocess ing ,  was 
not we l l  de f ined .  
The generat ive  semant ics  models deepened the under ly ing  
s t ruc ture  and imposed a cons iderab le  gap between the la t te r  
and the sur face  s t ruc ture .  This gap was to be br idged by 
t rans format ions ,  which with McCawley inc luded very extens ive  
lexical changes. 
The functions of the underlying participants in the act- 
ion or state came to differ signifficantly from those of the 
surface nominal constituents. In Fillmore's model (Fillmore, 
1969) the subject of the surface structure correlated not only 
sub jec t "  or "actor"  but a l so  wi th  an with  the N ~de~ly i~ 
under ly ing  pat ient ,  exper ienc 'er ,  l ocat ive . . .  To provide fo r  
th i s  cor re la t ion ,  F i l lmore  set  up ru les  fo r  systhemat ic  sub-  
Jec t iv i za t ion  of non-agent ive  "under ly ing  cases" .  What "s more, 
- 291  - 
he ass igned  to each verb a spec i f i c  "case frame" which o f ten  
lead to propos ing features  o f  cond i t iona l  ob l tgator iness  ( re -  
p resented  in  h ie  notat ion  by embedded and in tersect ing  brack-  
e ts ) .  S imi la r  endeavoars fo r  cor re la t ing  under ly ing  funct ions  
with d ivergent  sur face  const i tuents  lead Gruber (1967) to 
vague character i za t ions ,  o f ten  in  d i f fe rent  terms fo r  d i f fe r -  
ent c lasses  of verbs .  Anderson (1971), in  h i s  tu rn ,  opposing 
the character i za t ion  of sub,  so t /verb  re la t ions  in  terms l i ke  
"ac tor /ac t ion" ,  o f fe red  a great  var ie ty  of case funct ions  to 
be ass igned  to h i s  noun phrases ,  depending on the nature  of 
the i r  par t i c ipat ion  in  the "process" or "s ta te"  represented  
by the pred icate .  
More recent ly ,  generat ive  l ingu is ts  have been becoming 
increas ing ly  aware o f  the necess i ty  to d i s t ingu ish  meaning,  
taken as the l ingu is t i c  counterpar t  of ~mCensional s t ruc ture  
of sense ,  from cogn i t ive  content ,  i .e .  from the language inde-  
pendent pat tern ings  of fac tua l  knowledge. Thus, F i l lmore  (1977) 
reexamines h is  under ly ing  cases ,  p laces  them outs ide  the lan -  
guage system in  a s t r i c t  sense  - in  the realm of conceptua l -  
i za t ion ,  and assumes that  the under ly ing  s t ruc ture  of language 
proper  i s  se t  up by "c reat ing  cond i t ions  under which a speaker  
cheese to draw. certain case roles into perspective". Sgall 
(1980), in his turn, olalms that hle multi-level generative 
model permi ts  to set  up semant ic ,  under ly ing ,  tec togrammat ica l  
units, which are set off from the cognitive level "case-roles" 
but relate to them through Panevov~?s regular system of shift- 
Ing (Panevov~, 1980). Thls shifting can, of course, be accom- 
modated i n  the realm of conceptua l i za t ion  wi thout  the system 
of  levels of functional generative 5Tammar. Recent transfers 
of se lec t ion  of "case- ro les"  in to  conceptua l i za t ion  has not 
made l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ion  persp icuous ly  s imp ler .  The ana lys t  
has the choice of (a) in t roduc ing  a set  of ru les  that  would 
"sh i f t "  the conceptua l  case ro les  so that  they may natura l ly  
take the i r  appropr ia te  p laces  in  under ly ing  s t ruc ture  or e l se  
(b) making prov is ions  fo r  ad justment  ru les  between the leve ls

of  under ly in8 and surface s t ruc ture .  
Tn the be l ie f  that  the const i tuents  of  the under ly ing 
s t ruc ture  of  a model~ fo r  automat ic  generat ion  of  the sentences  
o f  a natura l  language should be de f ined  in  terms that  assoc ia -  
te  them c lose ly  to  respect ive  sur face  s t ruc ture  const i tuents ,  
ou~ in i t ia l  e f fo r ts  fo r  the const ruc t ion  of  a g~- . - .ar  fo r  
autoamtio  generat ion  of  Serbo-Croat ian  have lead  us to a p re -  
d ica te -centered  under ly ing  s t ruc ture  whose nominals fa l l  w i th -  
in  two genera l  types :  nuc lear  and ext ranuc lear  or adverb ia l .  
m i le  the la t te r  are  opt iona l ,  the former  ave ob l igator7  fo r  
a g iven  pred icate |  they  can be abstent  from the sur face  
s t ruc ture  but are  always recoverab le .  The n ,~ber  and type of  
nuc les~ nominals that  re la te  to each g iven  pred icate  can be .  
s ta ted  in  a p red icate  d ic t ionary .  When the under ly ing  s t ruc t -  
ure of  ind iv idua l  sentences  are being generated ,  these  d ic t -  
i onar ies  can serve as gu ides  fo r  the se lec t ion  of  the nuc lear  
nominals fo r  each pred icate ,  which can be de f ined  as the 
f i rst ,  second, th i rd  , . .  nominal  of a g iven  predicate (~he 
exact  nomber should be detez'mtned wi th  tes ts  fo r  ob l igator i -  
nasa) .  The f i r s t  nominal (or nominal one) i s  the nominal from 
Qhich the ac t ion  or s ta te  denoted by the pred icate  cz~lg inates,  
the second nominal (or nominal two) i s  the nominal towards 
which the ac t ion  or s ta te  of  the pred icate  i s  d i rec ted ,  where-  
as the th i rd  nmninsl (or  nominal th ree)  i s  the nominal funct -  
i on ing  as an intoz~nedtary between nominal 1 and nominal 20 
The l inear  o rder ing  of  the sur face  s t ruc ture  const i tuents  
does not  always correspond to the  order ing  of the under ly ing  
nomina ls ;  however, in  the cc=municat ive ly  "nmarked sentences  
the CorTespondenoe between the type of  sur face  s t ruc ture  
f~u~otion and type of  under ly ing  s t ruc ture  nominal i s  s tab le .  
In  these  sentences ,  nominal  one i s  rea l i zed  as sub jec t ,  nomi- 
na l  two as d i rec t  ob jec t  or  any o ther  type of  d i rec t  comple-  
ment ( i .e .  complement which re la tes  to  the verb d i rec t ly ) ,  
wh i le  nominal th ree  i s  rea l i zed  as ind i rec t  ob.lect or  any 
o ther  cemplement that  i s  cont ingent  on the presence of  another  
oemploment.

I n  the in f lec t ive  languages (and Serbo-Croat ian  I s  one 
of them) the sur face  s t ruc ture  const i tuents  are marked by 
spec i f i c  su f f i xes .  The morphonolcgioal  changes incur red  by 
su f f txat ion  are usua l ly  be ing a t t r ibuted  to  ,the operat ions  of 
some morphonologica ! component or s t ra ta .  We, however, main-  
ta in  that  the ass igxnent  of the su f f i x  and the morphonologica l  
changes accompanying i t can be done by the ru les  that  t rans -  
form (or t rans la te )  the ~der ly ing  s t ruc ture  in to  sur face  
s t ruc ture .  V i tae (1980) has const ructed  a pro~ -m fo r  auto -  
marie generat ion  of the nominal  parad i~a.  We s~e now dev is ing  
s igna ls  which, when at tached to the argu :ents  and ad~erb ia l  
n"mins l s  of the under ly ing  s t ruc ture ,  would t r igger  the gener -  
a t ion  of In f lec ted  nominal  sur face  s t ruc ture  const i tuents  
a long wi th  the i r  respect ive  prepos i t ions ,  i f  any.  At the same 
t ime,  work on the automat ic  generat ion  of the pred icate  phrase 
const i tuents  i s  under way. 
In  the f i r s t  generat ive  (Engl ish  language based) models 
morphology was ass igned  an ansc i l l a ry  ro le .  Work with in f lec t -  
ed languages has shown that  i t  should be dea l t  wi th  indepen-  
dent  of ,  though in  coord inat ion  wi th ,  syntax .  By deve lop ing  
programs fo r  automat ic  generat ion  of the morphons log lca l  
fo~s ,  whi le  working on the syntact i c  and semantic  camponent(s)  
of the grs~mar, we hope to be able  to  bu i ld  a model which i s  
fox, sa l l y  s4mple and in  which the u~mderlying s t ruc t~e w i l l  
not be excess ive ly  remote t~cea the sur face  one.
