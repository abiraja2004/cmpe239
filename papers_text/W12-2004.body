Abstract
To date, few attempts have been made to de-
velop new methods and validate existing ones
for automatic evaluation of discourse coher-
ence in the noisy domain of learner texts.
We present the first systematic analysis of
several methods for assessing coherence un-
der the framework of automated assessment
(AA) of learner free-text responses. We ex-
amine the predictive power of different coher-
ence models by measuring the effect on per-
formance when combined with an AA system
that achieves competitive results, but does not
use discourse coherence features, which are
also strong indicators of a learner?s level of at-
tainment. Additionally, we identify new tech-
niques that outperform previously developed
ones and improve on the best published result
for AA on a publically-available dataset of En-
glish learner free-text examination scripts.
1 Introduction
Automated assessment (hereafter AA) systems of
English learner text assign grades based on textual
features which attempt to balance evidence of writ-
ing competence against evidence of performance er-
rors. Previous work has mostly treated AA as a
supervised text classification or regression task. A
number of techniques have been investigated, in-
cluding cosine similarity of feature vectors (Attali
and Burstein, 2006), often combined with dimen-
sionality reduction techniques such as Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 2003), and
generative machine learning models (Rudner and
Liang, 2002) as well as discriminative ones (Yan-
nakoudakis et al., 2011). As multiple factors influ-
ence the linguistic quality of texts, such systems ex-
ploit features that correspond to different properties
of texts, such as grammar, style, vocabulary usage,
topic similarity, and discourse coherence and cohe-
sion.
Cohesion refers to the use of explicit linguistic
cohesive devices (e.g., anaphora, lexical semantic
relatedness, discourse markers, etc.) within a text
that can signal primarily suprasentential discourse
relations between textual units (Halliday and Hasan,
1976). Cohesion is not the only mechanism of dis-
course coherence, which may also be inferred from
meaning without presence of explicit linguistic cues.
Coherence can be assessed locally in terms of tran-
sitions between adjacent clauses, parentheticals, and
other textual units capable of standing in discourse
relations, or more globally in terms of the overall
topical coherence of text passages.
There is a large body of work that has investi-
gated a number of different coherence models on
news texts (e.g., Lin et al. (2011), Elsner and Char-
niak (2008), and Soricut and Marcu (2006)). Re-
cently, Pitler et al. (2010) presented a detailed survey
of current techniques in coherence analysis of ex-
tractive summaries. To date, however, few attempts
have been made to develop new methods and vali-
date existing ones for automatic evaluation of dis-
course coherence and cohesion in the noisy domain
of learner texts, where spelling and grammatical er-
rors are common.
Coherence quality is typically present in marking
criteria for evaluating learner texts, and it is iden-
33
tified by examiners as a determinant of the overall
score. Thus we expect that adding a coherence met-
ric to the feature set of an AA system would better
reflect the evaluation performed by examiners and
improve performance. The goal of the experiments
presented in this paper is to measure the effect a
number of (previously-developed and new) coher-
ence models have on performance when combined
with an AA system that achieves competitive results,
but does not use discourse coherence features.
Our contribution is threefold: 1) we present the
first systematic analysis of several methods for as-
sessing discourse coherence in the framework of
AA of learner free-text responses, 2) we identify
new discourse features that serve as proxies for the
level of (in)coherence in texts and outperform pre-
viously developed techniques, and 3) we improve
the best results reported by Yannakoudakis et al.
(2011) on the publically available ?English as a Sec-
ond or Other Language? (ESOL) corpus of learner
texts (to date, this is the only public-domain corpus
that contains grades). Finally, we explore the utility
of our best model for assessing the incoherent ?out-
lier? texts used in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011).
2 Experimental Design & Background
We examine the predictive power of a number of
different coherence models by measuring the effect
on performance when combined with an AA system
that achieves state-of-the-art results, but does not
use discourse coherence features. Specifically, we
describe a number of different experiments improv-
ing on the AA system presented in Yannakoudakis
et al. (2011); AA is treated as a rank preference
supervised learning problem and ranking Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) (Joachims, 2002) are used
to explicitly model the grade relationships between
scripts. This system uses a number of different lin-
guistic features that achieve good performance on
the AA task. However, these features only focus on
lexical and grammatical properties, as well as errors
within individual sentences, ignoring discourse co-
herence, which is also present in marking criteria for
evaluating learner texts, as well as a strong indicator
of a writer?s understanding of a language.
Also, in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011), experiments
are presented that test the validity of the system
using a number of automatically-created ?outlier?
texts. The results showed that the model is vulner-
able to input where individually high-scoring sen-
tences are randomly ordered within a text. Failing to
identify such pathological cases makes AA systems
vulnerable to subversion by writers who understand
something of its workings, thus posing a threat to
their validity. For example, an examinee might learn
by rote a set of well-formed sentences and repro-
duce these in an exam in the knowledge that an AA
system is not checking for prompt relevance or co-
herence1.
3 Dataset & Experimental Setup
We use the First Certificate in English (FCE) ESOL
examination scripts2 (upper-intermediate level as-
sessment) described in detail in Yannakoudakis et al.
(2011), extracted from the Cambridge Learner Cor-
pus3 (CLC). The dataset consists of 1,238 texts be-
tween 200 and 400 words produced by 1,238 distinct
learners in response to two different prompts. An
overall mark has been assigned in the range 1?40.
For all experiments, we use a series of 5-fold
cross-validation runs on 1,141 texts from the exami-
nation year 2000 to evaluate performance as well as
generalization of numerous models. Moreover, we
identify the best model on year 2000 and we also test
it on 97 texts from the examination year 2001, previ-
ously used in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) to report
the best published results. Validating the results on
a different examination year tests generalization to
some prompts not used in 2000, and also allows us to
test correlation between examiners and the AA sys-
tem. Again, we treat AA as a rank preference learn-
ing problem and use SVMs, utilizing the SVMlight
package (Joachims, 2002), to facilitate comparison
with Yannakoudakis et al. (2011).
4 Discourse Coherence
We focus on the development and evaluation of (au-
tomated) methods for assessing coherence in learner
1Powers et al. (2002) report the results of a related exper-
iment with the AA system e-Rater, in which experts tried to
subvert the system by submitting essays they believed would be
inaccurately scored.

texts under the framework of AA. Most of the meth-
ods we investigate require syntactic analysis. As in
Yannakoudakis et al. (2011), we analyze all texts us-
ing the RASP toolkit (Briscoe et al., 2006)4.
4.1 ?Superficial? Proxies
In this section we introduce diverse classes of ?su-
perficial? cohesive features that serve as proxies for
coherence. Surface text properties have been as-
sessed in the framework of automatic summary eval-
uation (Pitler et al., 2010), and have been shown to
significantly correlate with the fluency of machine-
translated sentences (Chae and Nenkova, 2009).
4.1.1 Part-of-Speech (POS) Distribution
The AA system described in Yannakoudakis et
al. (2011) exploited features based on POS tag se-
quences, but did not consider the distribution of POS
types across grades. In coherent texts, constituent
clauses and sentences are related and depend on each
other for their interpretation. Anaphors such as pro-
nouns link the current sentence to those where the
entities were previously mentioned. Pronouns can
be directly related to (lack of) coherence and make
intuitive sense as cohesive devices. We compute the
number of pronouns in a text and use it as a shallow
feature for capturing coherence.
4.1.2 Discourse Connectives
Discourse connectives (such as but or because) re-
late propositions expressed by different clauses or
sentences. The presence of such items in a text
should be indicative of (better) coherence. We thus
compute a number of shallow cohesive features as
proxies for coherence, based on fixed lists of words
belonging to the following categories: (a) Addition
(e.g., additionally), (b) Comparison (e.g., likewise),
(c) Contrast (e.g., whereas) and (d) Conclusion (e.g.,
therefore), and use the frequencies of these four cat-
egories as features.
4.1.3 Word Length
The previous AA system treated script length as
a normalizing feature, but otherwise avoided such
?superficial? proxies of text quality. However, many
cohesive words are longer than average, especially
for the closed-class functional component of English
4http://ilexir.co.uk/applications/rasp/
vocabulary. We thus assess the minimum, maximum
and average word length as a superficial proxy for
coherence.
4.2 Semantic Similarity
We explore the utility of inter-sentential feature
types for assessing discourse coherence. Among the
features used in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011), none
explicitly captures coherence and none models inter-
sentential relationships. Incremental Semantic anal-
ysis (ISA) (Baroni et al., 2007) is a word-level dis-
tributional model that induces a semantic space from
input texts. ISA is a fully-incremental variation of
Random Indexing (RI) (Sahlgren, 2005), which can
efficiently capture second-order effects in common
with other dimensionality-reduction methods based
on singular value decomposition, but does not rely
on stoplists or global statistics for weighting pur-
poses.
Utilizing the S-Space package (Jurgens and
Stevens, 2010), we trained an ISA model5 using a
subset of ukWaC (Ferraresi et al., 2008), a large cor-
pus of English containing more than 2 billion tokens.
We used the POS tagger lexicon provided with the
RASP system to discard documents whose propor-
tion of valid English words to total words is less than
0.4; 78,000 documents were extracted in total and
were then preprocessed replacing URLs, email ad-
dresses, IP addresses, numbers and emoticons with
special markers. To measure local coherence we de-
fine the similarity between two sentences si and si+1
as the maximum cosine similarity between the his-
tory vectors of the words they contain. The overall
coherence of a text T is then measured by taking the
mean of all sentence-pair scores:
coherence(T ) =
?n?1
i=1 maxk,j sim(s
k
i , s
j
i+1)
n? 1
(1)
where sim(ski , s
j
i+1) is the cosine similarity between
the history vectors of the kth word in si and the
jth word in si+1, and n is the total number of
sentences6. We investigate the efficacy of ISA by
adding this coherence score, as well as the maximum
5The parameters of our ISA model are fairly standard: 1800
dimensions, a context window of 3 words, impact rate i =
0.0003 and decay rate km = 50.
6We exclude articles, conjunctions, prepositions and auxil-
iary verbs from the calculation of sentence similarity.

sim value found over the entire text, to the vectors
of features associated with a text. The hypothesis
is that the degree of semantic relatedness between
adjoining sentences serves as a proxy for local dis-
course coherence; that is, coherent text units contain
semantically-related words.
Higgins et al. (2004) and Higgins and Burstein
(2007) use RI to determine the semantic similarity
between sentences of same/different discourse seg-
ments (e.g., from the essay thesis and conclusion, or
between sentences and the essay prompt), and assess
the percentage of sentences that are correctly clas-
sified as related or unrelated. The main differences
from our approach are that we assess the utility of se-
mantic space models for predicting the overall grade
for a text, in contrast to binary classification at the
sentence-level, and we use ISA rather than RI7.
4.3 Entity-based Coherence
The entity-based coherence model, proposed by
Barzilay and Lapata (2008), is one of the most pop-
ular statistical models of inter-sentential coherence,
and learns coherence properties similar to those em-
ployed by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995).
Local coherence is modeled on the basis of se-
quences of entity mentions that are labeled with
their syntactic roles (e.g., subject, object). We con-
struct the entity grids using the Brown Coherence
Toolkit8,9 (Elsner and Charniak, 2011b), and use as
features the probabilities of different entity transi-
tion types, defined in terms of their role in adja-
cent sentences10. Burstein et al. (2010) show how
the entity-grid can be used to discriminate high-
coherence from low-coherence learner texts. The
main difference with our approach is that we eval-
uate the entity-grid model in the context of AA text
grading, rather than binary classification.
7We also used RI in addition to ISA, and found that it did
not yield significantly different results. In particular, we trained
a RI model with 2,000 dimensions and a context window of 3
on the same ukWaC data. Below we only report results for the
fully-incremental ISA model.

9The tool does not perform full coreference resolution; in-
stead, coreference is approximated by linking entities that share
a head noun.
10We represent entities with specified roles (Subject, Object,
Neither, Absent), use transition probabilities of length 2, 3 and
4, and a salience option of 2.
4.4 Pronoun Coreference Model
Pronominal anaphora is another important aspect
of coherence. Charniak and Elsner (2009) present
an unsupervised generative model of pronominal
anaphora for coherence modeling. In their imple-
mentation, they model each pronoun as generated by
an antecedent somewhere in the previous two sen-
tences. If a ?good? antecedent is found, the probabil-
ity of a pronoun will be high; otherwise, the proba-
bility will be low. The overall probability of a text
is then calculated as the probability of the result-
ing sequence of pronoun assignments. In our ex-
periments, we use the pre-trained model distributed
by Charniak and Elsner (2009) for news text to esti-
mate the probability of a text and include it as a fea-
ture. However, this model is trained on high-quality
texts, so performance may deteriorate when applied
to learner texts. It is not obvious how to train such
a model on learner texts and we leave this for future
research.
4.5 Discourse-new Model
Elsner and Charniak (2008) apply a discourse-new
classifier to model coherence. Their classifier dis-
tinguishes NPs whose referents have not been pre-
viously mentioned in the discourse from those that
have been already introduced, using a number of
syntactic and lexical features. To model coher-
ence, they assign each NP in a text a label Lnp ?
{new, old}11, and calculate the probability of a text
as ?np:NPsP (Lnp|np). Again, we use the pre-
trained model distributed by Charniak and Elsner
(2009) for news text to find the probability of a text
following Elsner and Charniak (2008) and include it
as a feature.
4.6 IBM Coherence Model
Soricut and Marcu (2006) adapted the IBM model
1 (Brown et al., 1994) used in machine translation
(MT) to model local discourse coherence. The intu-
ition behind the IBM model in MT is that the use of
certain words in a source language is likely to trig-
ger the use of certain words in a target language.
Instead, they hypothesized that the use of certain
words in a sentence tends to trigger the use of cer-
tain words in an adjoining sentence. In contrast to
11NPs with the same head are considered to be coreferent.
36
semantic space models such as ISA or RI (discussed
above), this method models the intuition that local
coherence is signaled by the identification of word
co-occurrence patterns across adjacent sentences.
We compute two features introduced by Soricut
and Marcu (2006): the forward likelihood and the
backward likelihood. The first refers to the likeli-
hood of observing the words in sentence si+1 condi-
tioned on si, and the latter to the likelihood of ob-
serving the words in si conditioned on si+1. We
extract 3 million adjacent sentences from ukWaC12,
and use the GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) imple-
mentation of IBM model 1 to obtain the probabili-
ties of recurring patterns. The forward and backward
probabilities are calculated over the entire text, and
their values are used as features in our feature vec-
tors13. We further extend the above model and incor-
porate syntactic aspects of text coherence by train-
ing on POS tags instead of lexical items. We try to
model the intuition that local coherence is signaled
by the identification of POS co-occurrence patterns
across adjacent sentences, where the use of certain
POS tags in a sentence tends to trigger the use of
other POS tags in an adjacent sentence. We analyze
3 million adjacent sentences using the RASP POS
tagger and train the same IBM model to obtain the
probabilities of recurring POS patterns.
4.7 Lemma/POS Cosine Similarity
A simple method of incorporating (syntactic) as-
pects of text coherence is to use cosine similarity
between vectors of lemma and/or POS-tag counts in
adjacent sentences. We experiment with both: each
sentence is represented by a vector whose dimen-
sion depends on the total number of lemmas/POS-
types. The sentence vectors are weighted using
lemma/POS frequency, and the cosine similarity be-
tween adjacent sentences is calculated. The coher-
ence of a text T is then calculated as the average
value of cosine similarity over the entire text14:
coherence(T ) =
?n?1
i=1 sim(si, si+1)
n? 1
(2)
12We use the same subset of documents as the ones used to
train our ISA model in Section 4.2.
13Pitler et al. (2010) have also investigated the IBM model to
measure text quality in automatically-generated texts.
14Pitler et al. (2010) use POS cosine similarity to measure
continuity in automatically-generated texts.
4.8 Locally-Weighted Bag-of-Words
The popular bag-of-words (BOW) assumption rep-
resents a text as a histogram of word occurrences.
While computationally efficient, such a represen-
tation is unable to maintain any sequential infor-
mation. The locally-weighted bag-of-words (LOW-
BOW) framework, introduced by Lebanon et al.
(2007), is a sequentially-sensitive alternative to
BOW. In BOW, we represent a text as a histogram
over the vocabulary used to generate that text. In
LOWBOW, a text is represented by a set of lo-
cal histograms computed across the whole text, but
smoothed by kernels centered on different locations.
More specifically, a smoothed characterization
of the local histogram is obtained by integrating a
length-normalized document with respect to a non-
uniform measure that is concentrated around a par-
ticular location ? ? [0, 1]. In accordance with the
statistical literature on non-parametric smoothing,
we refer to such a measure as a smoothing kernel.
The kernel parameters ? and ? specify the local his-
togram?s position in the text (i.e., where it is cen-
tered) and its scale (i.e., to what extent it is smoothed
over the surrounding region) respectively. In con-
trast to BOW or n-grams, which keep track of fre-
quently occurring patterns independent of their po-
sitions, this representation is able to robustly capture
medium and long range sequential trends in a text by
keeping track of changes in the histograms from its
beginning to end.
Geometrically, LOWBOW uses local smoothing
to embed texts as smooth curves in the multinomial
simplex. These curves summarize the progression
of semantic and/or statistical trends through the text.
By varying the amount of smoothing we obtain a
family of sequential representations possessing dif-
ferent sequential resolutions or scales. Low resolu-
tion representations capture topic trends and shifts
while ignoring finer details. High resolution repre-
sentations capture fine sequential details but make it
difficult to grasp the general trends within the text15.
Since coherence involves both cohesive lexical
devices and sequential progression within a text, we
believe that LOWBOW can be used to assess the se-
quential content and the global structure and coher-
15For more details regarding LOWBOW and its geometric
properties see Lebanon et al. (2007).
37
ence of texts. We use a publically-available LOW-
BOW implementation16 to create local histograms
over word unigrams. For the LOWBOW kernel
smoothing function (see above), we use the Gaus-
sian probability density function restricted to [0, 1]
and re-normalized, and a smoothing ? value of 0.02.
Additionally, we consider a total number of 9 local
histograms (discourse segments). We further extend
the above model and incorporate syntactic aspects of
text coherence by using local histograms over POS
unigrams. This representation is able to capture se-
quential trends abstracted into POS tags. We try
to model the hypothesis that coherence is signaled
by sequential, mostly inter-sentential progression of
POS types.
Since each text is represented by a set of local
histrograms/vectors, and standard SVM kernels can-
not work with such input spaces, we use instead a
kernel defined over sets of vectors: the diffusion
kernel (Lafferty and Lebanon, 2005) compares lo-
cal histograms in a one-to-one fashion (i.e., his-
tograms at the same locations are compared to each
other), and has proven to be useful for related tasks
(Lebanon et al., 2007; Escalante et al., 2011). To the
best of our knowledge, LOWBOW representations
have not been investigated for coherence evaluation
(under the AA framework). So far, they have been
applied to discourse segmentation (AMIDA, 2007),
text categorization (Lebanon et al., 2007), and au-
thorship attribution (Escalante et al., 2011).
5 Evaluation
We examine the predictive power of each of the co-
herence models/features described in Section 4 by
measuring the effect on performance when com-
bined with an AA system that achieves state-of-the-
art results on the FCE dataset, but does not use dis-
course coherence features. In particular, we use the
system described in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) as
our baseline AA system. Discourse coherence is a
strong indicator of thorough knowledge of a second
language and thus we expect coherence features to
further improve performance of AA systems.
We evaluate the grade predictions of our mod-
els against the gold standard grades in the dataset

cient (r) and Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient
(?) as is standard in AA research (Briscoe et al.,
2010). Table 1 gives results obtained by augmenting
the baseline model with each of the coherence fea-
tures described above. In each of these experiments,
we perform 5-fold cross-validation17 using all 1,141
texts from the exam year 2000 (see Section 3).
Most of the resulting models have minimal ef-
fect on performance18. However, word length, ISA,
LOWBOWlex, and the IBM modelPOSf derived mod-
els all improve performance, while larger differ-
ences are observed in r. The highest performance
? 0.675 and 0.678 ? is obtained with ISA, while the
second best feature is word length. The entity-grid,
the pronoun model and the discourse-new model do
not improve on the baseline. Although these mod-
els have been successfully used as components in
state-of-the-art systems for discriminating coherent
from incoherent news documents (Elsner and Char-
niak, 2011b), and the entity-grid model has also
been successfully applied to learner text (Burstein
et al., 2010), they seem to have minimal impact
on performance, while the discourse-new model de-
creases ? by?0.01. On the other hand, LOWBOWlex
and LOWBOWPOS give an increase in performance,
which confirms our hypothesis that local histograms
are useful. Also, the former seems to perform
slightly better than the latter.
Our adapted version of the IBM model ? IBM
modelPOS ? performs better than its lexicalized ver-
sion, which does not have an impact on perfor-
mance, while larger differences are observed in r.
Additionally, the increase in performance is larger
than the one obtained with the entity-grid, pro-
noun or discourse-new model. The forward ver-
sion of IBM modelPOS seems to perform slightly
better than the backward one, while the results are
comparable to LOWBOWPOS and outperformed by
LOWBOWlex. The rest of the models do not perform
as well; the number of pronouns or discourse con-
nectives gives low results, while lemma and POS co-
sine similarity between adjacent sentences are also

applying the r-to-Z Fisher transformation, and then using the
Fisher weighted mean correlation coefficient (Faller, 1981).

among the weakest predictors.
Elsner and Charniak (2011b) have shown that
combining the entity-grid with the pronoun,
discourse-new and lexicalized IBM models gives
state-of-the-art results for discriminating news docu-
ments and their random permutations. We also com-
bine these models and assess their performance un-
der the AA framework. Row 16 of Table 1 shows
that the combination does not give an improvement
over the individual models. Moreover, combining
all feature classes together in row 17 does not yield
higher results than those obtained with ISA, while ?
is no better than the baseline.
In the following experiments, we evaluate the best
model identified on year 2000 on a set of 97 texts
from the exam year 2001, previously used in Yan-
nakoudakis et al. (2011) to report results of the fi-
nal best system. Validating the model on a different
exam year also shows us the extent to which it gen-
eralizes between years. Table 2 presents the results.
The published correlations on this dataset are 0.741

of the previous system significantly improves19 the

published results on the 2001 texts, getting closer to
the upper-bound. The upper-bound on this dataset20
is 0.796 and 0.792 r and ? respectively, calculated
by taking the average correlation between the FCE
grades and the ones provided by 4 senior ESOL ex-
aminers21. Table 3 also presents the average corre-
lation between our extended AA system?s predicted
grades and the 4 examiners? grades, in addition to
the original FCE grades from the dataset. Again,
our extended model improves over the baseline.
Finally, we explore the utility of our best model
for assessing the publically available ?outlier? texts
used in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011). The previous
AA system is unable to downgrade appropriately
?outlier? scripts containing individually high-scoring
sentences with poor overall coherence, created by
randomly ordering a set of highly-marked texts. To
test our best system, we train an SVM rank prefer-
ence model with the ISA-derived coherence feature,
which can explicitly capture such sequential trends.
A generic model for flagging putative ?outlier? texts
? whose predicted score is lower than a predefined
threshold ? for manual checking might be used as
the first stage of a deployed AA system. The ISA
model improves r and ? by 0.320 and 0.463 respec-
tively for predicting a score on this type of ?outlier?
texts and their original version (Table 4).
6 Analysis & Discussion
In the previous section, we evaluated various co-
hesion and coherence features on learner data, and
found different patterns of performance compared to
those previously reported on news texts (see Section
7 for more details). Although most of the models ex-
amined gave a minimal effect on AA performance,
ISA, LOWBOWlex, IBM modelPOSf and word length
dependent correlations (Williams, 1959; Steiger, 1980).

gave a clear improvement in correlation, with larger
differences in r. Our results indicate that coherence
metrics further improve the performance of a com-
petitive AA system. More specifically, we found the
ISA-derived feature to be the most effective contrib-
utor to the prediction of text quality. This suggests
that incoherence in FCE texts might be due to topic
discontinuities. Also, the improvement obtained by
LOWBOW suggests that patterns of sequential pro-
gression within a text can be useful: coherent texts
appear to use similar token distributions at similar
locations across different documents.
The word length feature was successfully used as
a proxy for coherence, perhaps because many cohe-
sive words are longer than average. However, such
a feature can also capture further aspects of texts,
such as lexical complexity, so further investigation
is needed to identify the extent to which it measures
different properties. On the other hand, the minimal
effect of the entity-grid, pronoun and discourse-new
model suggests that infelicitous use of pronominal
forms or sequences of entities may not be an issue
in FCE texts. Preliminary investigation of the scripts
showed that learners tend to repeat the same entity
names or descriptions rather than use pronouns or
shorter descriptions.
A possible explanation for the difference in per-
formance between the lexicalized and POS IBM
model is that the latter abstracts away from lexi-
cal information and thus avoids misspellings and
reduces sparsity. Also, our discourse connective
classes do not seem to have a predictive power. This
may be because our manually-built word lists do not
have sufficient coverage.
7 Previous Work
Comparatively few metrics have been investigated
for evaluating coherence in (ESOL) learner texts.
Miltsakaki and Kukich (2004) employ e-Rater (At-
tali and Burstein, 2006), an essay scoring system,
and show that Centering Theory?s Rough-Shift tran-
sitions (Grosz et al., 1995) contribute significantly to
the assessment of learner texts. Higgins et al. (2004)
and Higgins and Burstein (2007) use RI to deter-
mine the semantic similarity between sentences of
same/different discourse segments. Their model is
based on a number of different semantic similarity
scores and assesses the percentage of sentences that
are correctly classified as (un)related. Among their
results, they found that it is hard to beat the baseline
(as 98.1% of the sentences were annotated as ?highly
related?) and identify sentences which are not related
to other ones in the same discourse segment. We
demonstrate that the related fully-incremental ISA
model can be used to improve AA grading accuracy
on the FCE dataset, as opposed to classifying the
(non-)relatedness of sentences.
Burstein et al. (2010) show how the entity-grid
can be used to discriminate high-coherence from
low-coherence learner texts. They augment this
model with additional features related to writing
quality and word usage, and show a positive effect
in performance for automated coherence prediction
of student essays of different populations. On the
FCE dataset used here, entity-grids do not improve
AA grading accuracy. This may be because the texts
are shorter or because grading is a more difficult task
than binary classification. Application of their aug-
mented entity-grid model to FCE texts would be an
interesting avenue for future research.
Foltz et al. (1998) examine local coherence in
textbooks and articles using Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 2003). They assess se-
mantic relatedness using vector-based similarity be-
tween adjacent sentences. They argue that LSA may
be more appropriate for comparing the relative qual-
ity of texts; for determining the overall text coher-
ence it may be difficult to set a criterion for the co-
herence value since it depends on a variety of dif-
ferent factors, such as the size of the text units to be
compared. Nevertheless, our results show that ISA,
a similar distributional semantic model with dimen-
40
sionality reduction, improves FCE grading accuracy.
Barzilay and Lee (2004) implement lexicalized
content models that represent global text proper-
ties on news articles and narratives using Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs). In the HMM, states cor-
respond to distinct topics, and transitions between
states represent the probability of moving from one
topic to another. This approach has the advantage
of capturing the order in which different topics ap-
pear in texts; however, the HMMs are highly domain
specific and would probably need retraining for each
distinct essay prompt.
Soricut and Marcu (2006) use a log-linear model
that combines local and global models of coher-
ence and show that it outperforms each of the in-
dividual ones on news articles and accident reports.
Their global model is based on the document con-
tent model proposed by Barzilay and Lee (2004).
Their local model of discourse coherence is based
on the entity-grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008), as
well as on the lexicalized IBM model (see Section
4.6 above); we have experimented with both, and
showed that they have a minimal effect on grading
performance with the FCE dataset.
Elsner and Charniak (2008;2011a) apply a
discourse-new classifier and a pronoun coreference
system to model coherence (see Section 4) on dia-
logue and news texts. They found that combining
these models with the entity-grid achieves state-of-
the-art performance. We found that such a combina-
tion, as well as the individual models do not perform
well for grading the FCE texts.
Recently, Elsner and Charniak (2011a) proposed a
variation of the entity-grid intended to integrate top-
ical information. They use Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (Blei et al., 2003) to learn topic-to-word distri-
butions, and model coherence by generalizing the bi-
nary history features of the entity-grid and comput-
ing a real-valued feature which represents the simi-
larity between an entity and the subject(s) of the pre-
vious sentence. Also, Lin et al. (2011) proposed a
model that assesses the coherence of a text based on
discourse relation transitions. The underlying idea
is that coherent texts exhibit measurable preferences
for specific intra- and inter-discourse relation order-
ing. They found their model to be complementary to
the entity-grid, as it encodes the notion of preferen-
tial ordering of discourse relations, and thus tackles
local coherence from a different perspective. Apply-
ing the above models to AA on learner texts would
also be an interesting avenue for future work.
8 Conclusion
We presented the first systematic analysis of a wide
variety of models for assessing discourse coherence
on learner data, and evaluated their individual per-
formance as well as their combinations for the AA
grading task. We adapted the LOWBOW model for
assessing sequential content in texts, and showed
evidence supporting our hypothesis that local his-
tograms are useful. We also successfully adapted
ISA, an efficient and incremental variant distribu-
tional semantic model, to this task. ISA, LOWBOW,
the POS IBM model and word length are the best in-
dividual features for assessing coherence.
A significant improvement over the AA system
presented in Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) and the
best published result on the FCE dataset was ob-
tained by augmenting the system with an ISA-based
local coherence feature. However, it is quite likely
that further experimentation with LOWBOW fea-
tures, given the large range of possible parameter
settings, would yield better results too.
We also explored the robustness of the ISA model
of local coherence on ?outlier? texts and achieved
much better correlations with the examiner?s grades
for these texts in the FCE dataset. This should facil-
itate development of an automated system to detect
essays consisting of high-quality but incoherent se-
quences of sentences.
All our results are specific to ESOL FCE texts and
may not generalize to other genres or ESOL attain-
ment levels. Future work should also investigate a
wider range of (learner) texts and further coherence
models, such as that of Elsner and Charniak (2011a)
and Lin et al. (2011).
