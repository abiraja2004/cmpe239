Summary 
The lexical component of a human 
language is typically heterogeneous and 
extremely complex. Before we can come 
to grips with the underlying lexical 
organization, we must reduce the be- 
wi ldering complexity. Methods must be 
elaborated by which the interrelations 
between the units of the lexicon can be 
elucidated. This paper describes how a 
Swedish lexical material stored in a 
computer has been semantical ly strati- 
fied as a stage in the semantic ana- 
lysis of the items included in the data 
base. In particular, a minor subset of 
the lexical items, consist ing of 
current words in the language, has been 
selected as metalanguage in the defini- 
tions. It is argued that, in this way, 
a means of describing the relative 
semantic complexity in lexical units 
is provided. 
Introduction 
The semantic and syntactic inter- 
relations between the lexical units of 
a human language are notoriously com- 
plex and intricate, whether considered 
from the individual language-user's 
point of view or from the perspective 
of the collective competence of a 
language community. Indeed, they are 
so complex that, when it comes to 
thorough semantic analysis, scholars 
have only been able to handle small 
portions of the lexicon at a time. The 
typical lexico-semantic study has 
therefore concerned single lexical 
items or small groups of semantically 
interrelated items, in particular 
so-called word-f ields or semantic 
domains. 
On the other hand, there seems to 
be a growing sentiment among linguists 
that the lexical component is very 
basic to the functioning of language. 
The crucial role of the lexicon cannot, 
however, be adequately understood un- 
less the scope is widened. Detai led 
knowledge is, admittedly, quite in- 
dispensable in constructing an overall 
model of the lexicon; but large-scale 
lexical investigations are just as 
necessary in order to reveal the under- 
lying principles of lexical organiza- 
tion. Consequently, computer-based 
lexicology should rank high as a branch 
of computational and theoretical lin- 
guistics. 
The Heterogeneity of Lexicons 
Lexical inventories that have de- 
veloped spontaneously do not usually 
constitute neat and clear-cut systems. 
They are typically skewed in the sense 
that many phenomena which may seem quite 
marginal have nonetheless given rise to 
a rich vocabulary, in contrast to the 
lexical sparsity characterizing several 
domains that are logically more funda- 
mental to man. To take just one example, 
there are, in Swedish, rather few ex- 
pressions for eating while there is a 
great variety of verbs for making all 
sorts of noises displaying only minor 
acoustical (and perceptual) differentia- 
tion. Our creative capacity simply seems 
to be more nourished by our imagination 
with regard to sounds than by our 
imagination with regard to food con- 
sumption. That the asymmetry is quite 
arbitrary is emphasized by the fact 
that other essential human activit ies 
may produce a rich vocabulary. For 
instance, very fine distinctions can, 
in Swedish, be expressed monomorphemic- 
ally in the field of walking. 
Such disproportions as those just 
mentioned are basical ly due to histo- 
rical accidents, i.e. pure chance, more 
or less. Consequently, they are 
language-specif ic rather than universal 
and cannot be ascribed to any general 
tendencies in the human mind. The same 
holds for all culture-dependent ex- 
pressions. Thus, if the lexicons of 
many languages tend to contain words 
for buildings and vehicles, it is 
primari ly because human beings tend to 
develop such things and, secondarily, 
need to name them. It can be concluded 
that the reason for the recur rence  o f  
such terms in various languages all 
over the world is not essential ly 
(psycho) l inguistic but, rather, a 
corollary of comparable extra-linguistic 
circumstances.

Cultural  condi t ions may also give 
r ise to other types of lexical  hetero-  
geneity. The lexicon of a language may 
be v iewed as compr is ing  d i f ferent  
strata, some of which conta in common 
words used by everyone, others contain-  
ing words used exc lus ive ly  by special -  
ists. Technica l  language - where "tech- 
nical" should be taken in a broad 
sense - in var ious f ields, such as me- 
dicine, law, economy, technology,  etc.; 
some forms of language used in certa in 
pro fess ions  or by certa in soc ia l ly  de- 
f ined groups, l ike traders, priests, or 
out laws - these are examples of voca- 
bulary strata that are l ikely to be 
ful ly mastered only by re lat ive ly  few 
individuals.  It is to be deplored when 
the language of profess iona l  debaters,  
for instance in pol i t ics  and esthet ics,  
also develops in this d irect ion,  as is 
of ten the case. 
Other strata of language may be 
quite fami l iar  to a major i ty  of the 
language-users  a l though they are less 
f requent ly  employed, being tied up with 
d i f ferent  styles, registers,  or con- 
textual  settings. This may apply to the 
vocabulary  of honor i f ic  language, re- 
l ig ious language, etc. Such di f ferent ia-  
t ion in vocabular ies  as has been exemp- 
l i f ied here is mani fes ted  in a 
language-spec i f i c  way, but the very 
ex is tence of d i f fe rent ia t ion  is a uni- 
versal  trait. It has been suggested 
that lexical  inventor ies  can be sub- 
d iv ided into var ious domains obeying 
d i f ferent  sets of rules that govern the 
re lat ions between language and real ity. 
In other words, there may wel l  be 
var ious kinds of word meanings (cf. 
F i l lmore 1978). 5 In format ion about a 
many-sp lendoured  wor ld  is to be con- 
veyed by means of language. The phe- 
nomena referred to are quite d i f ferent  
in nature, and so the semantic content  
of lexical  items may vary accordingly.  
In most  authent ic  vocabular ies  
there is a gradient  ranging from more 
or less purely grammat ica l  operators  
and s t ructure -dependent  items (such as 
the copula, connect ives,  quant i f iers ,  
etc.), over items that are part ly  
system-or iented,  part ly  more semant ic-  
al ly we ighted (e.g. pronouns,  deict ic  
express ions,  prepos i t ions) ,  all the way 
to items simply indexing "encyclopedic"  
phenomena. There is much f luctuat ion 
from language to language in this re- 
gard, since the d iv is ion of labour 
between vocabulary  and grammar proper 
may vary. Thus the proport ion of words 
with pr imar i ly  grammat ica l  funct ions 
may di f fer  to a high degree between 
languages. However,  the grammar-or iented 
part of the vocabulary  tends to be 
shared by most  speakers,  more d i f feren-  
t iat ion being found at the other 
extreme. 
F i l lmore has ment ioned a number of 
ways in which languages may di f fer  with 
respect  to word semantics.  There are 
such features as re lat ive analyt ic i ty ,  
i.e. the degree of semantic trans- 
parency character i z ing  the total lexical  
system, taxonomic depth, by which is 
meant  the dosage of par t icu lar  as com- 
pared to gener ic  terms, patterns of 
meaning extension,  areas of synonymy 
elaborat ion,  co l locat iona l  patterns,  
etc. (Fi l lmore 1978, p. 155-157). 5 In 
fact, d i f ferent  domains with in the voca- 
bulary  of a single language may vary a 
great deal in these respects.  For in- 
stance, terminology is often, a l though 
not always, harder  to analyse than are 
common words. In part icular ,  terminology 
tends to invite heavy borrowing of for- 
eign lexical  mater ia l ;  in this way the 
port ion of arb i t rary  lexical  units 
increases. 
It cannot  be doubted that somewhere 
behind the confus ing complex i ty  of the 
lexicon there is a clue as to what human 
beings f ind imperat ive to recognize as 
de l imi ted concepts.  The categor i zat ion  
re f lected by lexical  inventor ies  is con- 
s iderably  d isgu ised through the hetero-  
geneity  which is a basic character i s t i c  
of the lexical  component,  as has been 
emphas ized repeatedly.  As a f irst step, 
then, methods must  be e laborated by 
which the complex i ty  can be duly 
handled. In part icular ,  the semantic 
redundancy of the authent ic  lexicon 
must be reduced. 
Reduc ing Redundancy 
It is very natural  in lexico-  
semantic  analys is  to take word def in i -  
t ions as a point  of departure.  It can 
be argued that a def ined word is seman- 
t ica l ly  more complex than each word used 
in the def in i t ion of that word. Also, 
it is a we l l -known fact that circularity 
very easi ly  creeps into def in i t ions.  
A l though c i rcu lar i ty  in def in i t ions  has 
occas iona l ly  been the target of investi- 
gat ion and has served successfu l ly  as a 
basis  for determin ing semantic re lated-  
ness (e.g. Calzonar i  1977), 2 it should, 
ideally, be control led.  
One way of ach iev ing maximal  reduc- 
tion of semantic redundancy  in the lex~ 
con is, of course, to def ine all lexical 
entr ies  by means of an ef fect ive meta-  
language, e.g. a minimal  def in ing voca- 
bulary. Our interest can then be focused 
116 
on this min imal  word- l i s t  on the assump- 
t ion that it covers the same semantic 
range as the complete vocabu lary  def ined 
by it. In pract ica l  lex icography,  de- 
f in ing vocabu lar ies  have been ut i l i zed 
in, for instance, The General  Basic  
Engl ish  D ic t ionary  (1942) ; 8 Michael  
West, An In ternat iona l  Reader 's  D ict ion-  
ary (1965); Iu and, in a pro ject  having 
much wider  scope and, therefore,  ho ld ing 
greater  theoret ica l  interest,  in 
Longman's  D ic t ionary  of Contemporary  
Engl ish  (1978).J 
Def in ing vocabu lar ies  are intui-  
t ively attract ive.  They seem to capture 
the not ion of basic vocabulary,  the 
general  lexical  subset inc luded in 
everybody 's  vocabulary.  In some excep-  
t ional  cases it is very easy to isolate 
this subset. In Dyirbal ,  for instance, 
a Queens land  Aust ra l ian  language, there 
is a special  vocabu lary  used in certa in  
social  contexts;  hence it is re fer red to 
as "mother - in - law language" (Dixon 
1971). 4 In this subsystem, Dyangul,  the 
same grammat ica l  rules apply, but the 
vocabu lary  is very res t r i c ted  so that, 
for instance, each Dyangul  verb corres-  
ponds to several  in the common language. 
Therefore,  the Dyangul  vocabu lary  can be 
taken as a model  for a semantic c lass i -  
f icat ion of words in Dyirbal.  
A s l ight  d isadvantage in us ing de- 
f ining vocabu lar ies  is the level l ing of 
depth in the l inguist ic  analysis.  The 
lexicon is cons idered  on two f ixed 
levels alone: that of the lexical  en- 
tr ies and that of the basic  def in ing 
words. As is wel l  known, however,  lexi-  
cal units play very d i f fe rent  rQleS in 
the language they are part  of. Not in- 
f requent ly,  the semantic  in ter re lat ions  
wi th in  g iven sets can only be represent -  
ed in a mul t i - l ayered  fashion. I do not 
wish to c la im that the human lexicon is, 
in any str ict  sense, h ie rarch ica l ly  or- 
ganized, but var ious subdiv is ions  of it 
may wel l  be. 
For instance, to catch something 
means roughly  'to get hold of something', 
to f ish means 'to try to catch f ish',  
~d  W angle means 'to fish with a hook 
and line'. Cons is tent  use of a minimal  
def in ing vocabu lary  wou ld  y ie ld  def in i -  
t ions l ike 'to try to get hold of f ish 
wi th  a hook and line' for to angle. This 
is by no means a tota l ly  inadequate de- 
f init ion. To angle is c lear ly  re lated to 
verbal  express ions  l ike to get hold of; 
the semantic re la tedness  becomes appar-  
ent in a compar ison with other verbs, 
such as to interrupt,  to sneeze, or to 
twinkle. The verbal  acts des ignated by 
to catch, to fish, and to angle are, 
however,  not abso lute ly  on a par with 
each other. Both to f ish and to angle 
"contain" an e lement  of catching. It can 
be argued that they di f fer  from each 
other, and from to catch, in the way the 
catch ing is specif ied. To f ish expl ica-  
tes the object  caught, viz. 'fish'. That 
f ish is caught is p resupposed by to 
angle as well,  but with the addi t ional  
spec i f i cat ion  of the f ishing method em- 
ployed. However,  the two types of speci-  
f icat ion are not equal wi th  respect  to 
the verbal  act 'to catch'.  Whi le  'to 
catch' is presupposed as an e lement  in 
to fish, the whole meaning 'to try to 
catch fish' is incorporated in to angle. 
The re lat ions can be expressed by 
bracket ing  in the fo l lowing manner: 
to catch - '(to try to get hold of)' 
to f ish - '(to catch \[= to try to 
get hold of\] (fish))' 
to angle - '(to f ish \[= to catch 
(= to try to get hold 
of) (fish)\] (with a 
hook and line))' 
The c loser  re lat ionsh ip  between to f ish 
and to angle may be ind icated by making 
use of to f ish in the def in i t ion  of to 
angle. Para l le l  t reatment  of pairs  or 
groups of verbs to the ef fect  that one 
verb may conta in  not only the general  
semantic propert ies  of another verb but 
actua l ly  the other verb itself  has been 
suggested by, among others, B inn ick  
(1971) I and F i l lmore (1978). 5 
In fact, this re lat ive semantic 
s t ra t i f i cat ion  of the lexicon is rather  
s imi lar  to Weinre ich 's  strategy for in- 
vest igat ing  the semantic content  of the 
lexical  inventory. Weinre ich  gives the 
fo l lowing presentat ion:  
St ratum 0: terms def inable  only 
c i rcu lar ly  and by os- 
tens ive def in i t ion  
St ratum I: terms whose def in i t ions  
conta in only stratum-0 
terms, but w i thout  
c i rcu lar i ty  
St ratum 2: terms whose def in i t ions  
conta in only stratum-0 
and stratum-1 terms, 
wi thout  c i rcu lar i ty  
Stratum n: terms whose def in i t ions  
conta in  only terms of 
strata 0, I, 2, ... n - 
I. 
He conc ludes that the meta language wi l l  
be made up of the complete ord inary  
language except  for s t ratum n (Weinreich 
1962). ~ 
A s imi lar  l ine of reasoning is at 
the bot tom of the organ izat ion  of the 
Swedish lex ica l  mater ia l  ana lysed in the 
117 - 
pro ject  Lex ica l  Data Base, carr ied out 
at the Department  of Computat iona l  Lin- 
guist ics,  Univers i ty  of GSteborg. A mi- 
nimal def in ing vocabulary  is, in pr in-  
ciple, ut i l i zed in def in i t ions.  In add i -  
tion, however,  words not inc luded in the 
def in ing vocabulary  proper are occas ion-  
al ly a l lowed in def in i t ions,  with the 
requ i rement  that they should be ult i -  
mate ly  reducib le  to str ict  def in ing 
vocabulary  units. The minimal  def in ing 
vocabulary  compr ises words denot ing very 
fundamental  concepts  per ta in ing  to 
phys ica l  e lements  and forces, geometr ic -  
al notions, topographica l  propert ies,  
state and movement,  location, time, 
causat ion,  basic organisms,  physica l  
and mental  funct ions of organisms,  etc., 
as well  as more cu l ture -sens i t ive  and 
convent iona l i zed  concepts,  such as 
colours,  artefacts,  social  condit ions,  
and the like. 
A larger subset than the def in ing 
vocabulary  is the so-ca l led ful ly de- 
f ined vocabulary.  This part of the voca- 
bulary is prov ided with e laborated de- 
f init ions. Together  with the def in ing 
vocabulary  it makes up the semantic  hard 
core of the lexicon taken as a whole. We 
are not l ikely to f ind more candidates  
for this part  of the vocabulary  no 
matter  how much mater ia l  is inc luded in 
the data base. Instead, new mater ia l  
tends to be of a more speci f ic  kind, 
e.g. terminology known by only a few 
people, a lmost  obsolete words, non- 
permanent  compounds that have barely 
passed the threshold of lex ica l izat ion,  
but which are easi ly  ana lysable  in terms 
of the we l l -de f ined  part  of the voca- 
bulary; in short, words which do not add 
anyth ing further to the basic  semantic 
system of the lexicon. These latter 
items are not ass igned any proper def i -  
n i t ions but are semant ica l ly  spec i f ied 
more summari ly.  
Thus the data base is, in prin- 
ciple, d iv ided into three strata: 
(I) the ~ ? i ~ _ ~ ! ~ X ,  whose 
units are axiomat ic  in a logic- 
al sense and highly rest r ic ted  
in number; 
(2) the ~!!x def ined vocabulary,  
whose units have carefu l ly  
formulated def in i t ions  based on 
the def in ing vocabulary;  
(3) the ~ K ~ h ~ _ ~ 2 ~ ! ~ Z ,  
whose units are semant ica l ly  
descr ibed by approximat ion.  
In l ine with the above reasoning as 
regards re lat ive semantic complexi ty,  
we a l low ent i t ies  from the ful ly def ined 
vocabulary  to enter into def in i t ions.  
They are u l t imate ly  reducib le  to 
de f in ing-vocabu lary  units. The def in i -  
t ions are more e legant ly  formulated in 
this manner, but, in part icular ,  the 
inter re lat ions  between lexical  items are 
more revea l ing ly  stated. Such an ap- 
proach, bu i ld ing on extens ive lexical  
c ross - re ferenc ing,  impl ies several  theo- 
ret ical  commitments.  Therefore,  it 
should be emphas ized  that the data base 
descr ibed here is a imed at contr ibut ing  
to \ [~X~! l~ the semantic in terre lat ions  
between lexical  items, in the f irst  
place. This, however,  should not be 
taken to mean that our goal has been an 
ideal u l t imate representat ion  of the 
semantic structure in the lexicon. 
Invest igat ing  Relat ive Semantic  
Complex i ty  
Careful  se lect ion of def in ing units 
and adequate def in i t iona l  formats are a 
prerequ is i te  for an acceptable  result  of 
the empir ica l  work under way. It is true 
that lex icographers  involved in pract ic-  
al undertak ings  natura l ly  seek to attain 
cons is tent  and adequate formulat ions in 
def in i t ions.  The requ i rement  is even 
stronger if semant ic  structure is the 
main object  of analysis.  
Mono l ingua l  d ic t ionar ies  usua l ly  
take the reader 's  knowledge of the 
language in quest ion for granted. As a 
consequence,  the def in i t ions  may not be 
expl ic i t  enough. For instance, the 
Swedish causat ive verbs fylla, glSdga, 
runda, sl~ta, sv~rta all agree in focus- 
ing on the result  of the respect ive 
activities. In a standard dict ionary,  
ISO, 6 they are def ined by verbal  phrases 
very s imi lar to each other in structure: 
Verb Def in i t ion  
fyl la 
'to fill' 
g l~dga 
'to make 
glowing' 
runda 
'to round' 
sl~ta 
'to smooth' 
sv~rta 
'to blacken' 
g~ra fu l l  
'to make full' 
g~ra g l~dande 
'to make glowing' 
g~ra rund(are) 
'to make round(er) ' 
g~ra sl~t 
'to make smooth' 
g~ra svart 
'to make black'  
However,  the verb of the paraphrases,  
g~ra 'to make', impl ies quite d i f ferent  
act iv i t ies  in the respect ive  cases, per- 
haps something like 'to regulate' ,  'to 
treat' ,  'to shape', 'to grind',  and 'to 
colour' .  By a iming at this h igher de- 
gree of exact i tude,  we both acquire a 
better  knowledge of the basic semantic 
propert ies  of the lexical  entr ies para- 
phrased and obtain good candidates  for 
118 
the eventual defining vocabulary. 
Although the material is stored in 
and manipulated by the computer, intui- 
tion and Sprachgef~hl play dominant 
roles in this work. Therefore, it is 
urgent to employ methods which may guide 
our intuitions in a favourable direc- 
tion. Since, in Swedish, there is no 
"mother-in-law language", the units of 
the defining vocabulary have to be de- 
termined by a number of methods with the 
joint goal of finding the minimal work- 
able set of defining words. One impor- 
tant method implies large-scale para- 
phrasing of verbs. In a first round, we 
concentrate on such verbs as have equi- 
valent paraphrases involving the base 
morpheme of the original verb, retained 
in the verb complement in the para- 
phrase. Such verbs are, for instance, 
the following: 
Verb Verb paraphrase 
bind-a 
'to bind' 
~xkl-a 
'to cycle' 
fisk-a 
'to fish' 
~ l -na  
'to turn

hamr-a 
'to hammer' 
kant-a 
'to edge' 
~-a

~-~ 
' to  saw i 
tor-ka 
'to dry' 
tvivl-a 
'to doubt' 
festa med band 
'to fix with a band' 
~ka (med/p~) ~ !  
'to go by bicycle' 
f~nga risk 
'to catch fish' 
bli 9ul(are) 
'to become (more) 
yellow' 
sl~ med hammare 
'to hit with a hammer' 
f~rse med kan~(er) 
'to provide with an 
edge (or: edges)' 
forma ku~-i~

kapa med s~H 
'to cut with a saw' 
g~ra Loll(are) 
'to make dry (or: 
drier)' 
k~nna tvivel 
'to feel doubt' 
The Swedish paraphrases are just 
as natural as the simple verbs in the 
examples given. There are hundreds of 
analogous cases. In a host of other 
examples, there are quite conceivable 
paraphrases of basically the same kind, 
although less conventional ized as col- 
locations. The following verbs are of 
this type: 
Verb Verb paraphrase 
blSd-a 
'to bleed' 
~\[~-! 
'to whiff' 
fuml-a 
'to fumble' 
h~-! 
'to buy' 
pensl-a 
'to paint' 
~!~-~ 
'to pain' 
skrik-a 
'to cry' 
~!-~ 
'to pile' 
~\[~-~ 
'to grieve' 
tr~l-a 
'to toil' 
uts6ndra blod 
'to give off blood' 
fiska med d~rj 
'to fish with a 
whiffing-line' 
bete sig fuml-igt 
'to act fumblingly' 
f~rv~rva genom k~ 
'to acquire through 
purchase' 
bestryka med ~ !  
'to paint with a 
brush' 
~samka R!~H-a (or: 
~a~-or) 
'to cause pain' 
utstSta skrik 
'to ejaculate a cry' 
uppl~gga i ~ !  
'to arrange in a pile' 
k~nna sq\[~ 
'to feel grief' 
arbeta som en tr~l 
'to work like a slave' 
The verbs of the paraphrases are 
usually deprived of much of the specific 
content characterizing the original, 
simple verbs. They emphasize the purely 
verbal element in the respective events. 
Most of the specific meaning lies, in- 
stead, in the verb complement in the 
paraphrases. It is easily seen that the 
paraphrase verbs represent different 
degrees of abstractness, i.e. they are 
semantically complex to a varying ex- 
tent. They are always, however, less 
complex than the corresponding simple 
verbs they derive from in the analysis. 
Considering the resemblance of these 
verbs to pronouns and other pro-forms, 
"pro-verb" would be a fitting term. 
Once the set of verbs to be used in 
paraphrases is established, it may also 
be employed for verbs with morphologic- 
ally dissimilar paraphrases. For in- 
stance, ~iska 'to love' : hysa k~rlek 
I to feel love , may be classif ied to- 
gether with other verbs of emotion. A 
similar mode of analysis may also be 
applied to such verbs as cannot be as- 
sociated with paraphrases in any appar- 
ent way: drabba 'to afflict', h~mta 'to 
fetch', m~rka 'to notice', etc. 
As to the formats of the defini- 
tions, it is obvious that the para- 
phrases signal some fundamental proper- 
ties of the paraphrased verbs, besides 
119 " 
the nature of the respect ive reduced 
verb. Some verbs incorporate an instru-  
ment, even morpho log ica l ly  recognizab le  
(cykla, d~r~a, s~ga, etc.),  others an 
object  impl ied in the event (bl~da, 
kanta);  sti l l  others focus on the result  
of the event (gulna, skrika, stapla, 
torka), or on the phenomenon or state 
perce ived by an exper iencer  (pl~ga, 
sofia). A class which is potent ia l ly  
very large integrates an adverb ia l  spe- 
c i f i cat ion of the event i tself  rather 
than the actants involved (e.g. l inka 
'to l imp', por la 'to purl ' ,  t indra 'to 
twinkle') .  
Re lat ions  s imi lar  to those obta in-  
ing between verbs and verbal  phrases 
wi th in  a language may be found if cor- 
responding verbal  express ions  are com- 
pared across languages. This is a wide-  
spread and natural  method for re inforc-  
ing observat ions  on patterns of language 
structure. In certa in lexical  domains 
one language may have deve loped single 
(i.e. re la t ive ly  arbitrary) verbs, whi le  
another  language may express the same 
content  by phrases. For instance, there 
is a large family of mot ion verbs in 
both Engl ish and Swedish. In Japanese,  
the same meanings are usual ly  rendered 
by var ious forms of the basic verb for 
'to walk' (aruku) augmented by one of a 
number of mimet ic  adverb ia l  elements.  
Interest ingly ,  some adverbs of the 
phrasal  co l locat ions  thus ar is ing in 
Japanese are, themselves,  l imited to a 
very rest r ic ted  context. This amounts 
to saying that the phrases are just as 
lex ica l ized as the s ingle verbs in Eng- 
l ish and Swedish (cf. F i l lmore 1978). 3 
Transfer r ing  this inter l ingual  com- 
par ison to one language only, we may 
note that verbal  paraphrases  lend them- 
selves to c lass i f i ca tory  work in an ana- 
logous way. Verbs may be more or less 
product ive  as pro-verbs in paraphrases,  
they may estab l ish  more or less natural  
paraphrases,  they may occur  in phrases 
which have cor respond ing  single verbs 
or not, they may be more or less syno- 
nymous or antonymous to verbs estab l ish-  
ed as pro-verbs,  etc. By compar ing dif-  
ferent pro-verbs and their  respect ive 
paraphrases  with each other we may also 
find that a pro-verb may occur in the 
paraphrase of another  pro-verb,  thus 
produc ing semantic l inks of the type 
d iscussed above. In such cases, the re- 
lat ive semantic  complex i ty  is c lear ly  
recognizable.  
Verbs, in part icular ,  are h ighly  
reward ing in such work as has been des- 
cr ibed here. Other word c lasses are, 
however,  access ib le  to bas ica l ly  the 
same type of analysis .  Of course, we are 
aware of many problems connected with 
this approach,  e.g. the quest ion  of syn- 
tact ic compat ib i l i ty  between or ig ina l  
i tems and their  paraphrases,  the rela-  
t ive arb i t rar iness  in se lect ing def in ing 
units, etc. Furthermore,  there are many 
features in the approach resembl ing  ge- 
nerat ive semantic  theory of the ear ly 
1970's (and, inc identa l ly ,  the work out- 
l ined in Mel '~uk and Zolkovski j  19697 
and elsewhere);  consequent ly ,  the same 
type of c r i t i c i sm as has been ra ised 
against  that theory appl ies to the pre- 
sent work. 
We do not f ind this too embarrass -  
ing. Our work is ch ief ly  empir ical ,  
s tart ing with observable  facts, i.e. the 
words themselves,  gradual ly  eat ing our 
way down into deeper semantic  structure.  
Thus, in a way, we are work ing in the 
opposi te  d i rect ion compared with the 
generat ive  semant ic ists .  We have no wish 
to reduce all lexical  items to a single 
under ly ing  category of units, and we are 
not prepared to press all lexical  items 
into one basic semant ic  schema. Rather, 
we hope to be able to shed some l ight on 
the r ichness of the semantic  system of 
Swedish, by e laborat ing a semant ica l ly  
based conver t ib i l i ty  system. The method 
we have used seems to us to provide a 
versat i le  means to such an end.
