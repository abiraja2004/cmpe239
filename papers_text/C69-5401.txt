Such graphs are cal led networks. An ear l ie r  example is  to be

been written at ~ ( ie .  in remark 4 ) , the above graphs oan be re-

ii. ELECTRICAL ANAIDGUES. If ~ g~aph like (6) or (7) is 
considered to be aa e lec t r i ca l  diagram where oath word i s  subst i tu t~ 
by a contact ,  and each arrow by an e lec t r i ca l  conductor (w i re ) ,  the 
result is u electrical analogue of the grammar. In this analogue if 
ome cIsses all comtee~8 correspomdlng to a semtemce, a contimuous 
electrical path is established and the curremt flows from ome extre- 
mity to the other. The detectiom of thim eurran@ is a proof of 
"grammaticality" for the word sequence under consideration. 
Electrical analogues can be designed also algebraically. For 
this it is necessary to proceed ~S ~o//Q~/~ 
from the list of sentences ~,  ~2, .... ~/~ 8tar t tng

type (1) ,and so on unt i l  the ~ lght  member of the formula conta ins  
only  the words o f  the vocabu lary .  Such a formula i s  (2) in  example 1' 
We have now at  our d i sposa l  a formula enumerating the ordered n-  
~p les  assoc ia ted  to a l l  sentences  o f  the language L. This formula 
is to be interpreted in terms of switching algebra as follows s 
- an n -#~ple  (Sl,a2,..?s r) correspon~to a series connec- 
tion of the elements al,s2,...ar ! 
- the union 6 ~/  correspond~ to s paralel connection of the

elements ~/! 
- the Cartesian product ~c~/? gi corresponds %o the paral~l 
connectio  of all .e r i=  c eotlo  sibl. where

In \[#\] is presented an electrical analogue of the grammar 
described by graph (7). 
12. GRAPHS OF TRANSIA TIONS~ This chapter and the following 
are intended as su~ested applications of the above discussion, to 
the understanding of the process of translatlon. No attempt is ma@f 
to start from more rigorous definitions, 85 may be found for e~-  
pie in /6\] or \[7\] ? Here the process of translation of a simple 
sentence from language L I , into language ~,  is regaz~led as consi% 
ring of the following operations s 
a) seek the given sentence in the d/ctionsry ~-~ | 
i 
b) if the whole sentence is found in the d/otionary, write 
e~ 
down the translation found there and ~ the process | 
c) if tBe sentence is not found in the dictionary, divide it 
into two subst~i~gs admitted by the gra-..sr (in fact, immediate 
const i tuents )  ! 
d) seek each of the substr/ngs in ~he dictionary | 
- 11  - 
e)  i f  one subst r lag  i s  found in  the  d ic t ionar~,  wr i te  down

f )  i f  one subst r ing  i s  not  found in  the  d ic t ionar~,  d iv ide  i t  
aga in  in to  two fur ther  substr~ngs and  then  proceed aga in  as  ind icated  
under  d)  ! 
6) the prooess stop~ when a strin6 is obtained which contains 
only words belonging to the vocabulary of the language L2. 
A difficulty rises currently during the process of transla- 
tion, and th i s  i s  due to  the  fac t  that  many words ,  o r  s t r ings  com- 
posed  of more than one wo~d , admit two or mo~e translations.Such 
is the case with homonyms. Special subroutines have been developed 
to solve t~e problem of homonyms in digital translation of language. 
Suoh subroutines are based on successive step, of conditioned decisi~ 
To quote only a few very simple examples, MARCUS , in \[8J ,gives ske~ 
ohes of algorithms for translating into Roumanian "example" and 
"this "and for solving the homonymy of the French "pas" or ~he En- 
glish "this"? The problem is related to that of sequential unde1~- 
s tand ing  of  s sentence ,  as  descr ibed  by  ZIEREH \[9\]  ? 
Le t  us  put  the  DEoblem somewhat d i f fe rent ly .  To choose  the  
wr i t s  word (o r  subst~i .~ between more than  one poss ib le  var iants ,  
we need some supp lementary  cond i t ion ,  o r  cond i t ions .  A f i r s t  and 
most  impor tant  cond i t ion  i s  that  the  r ight  word (substT~g)  must  
match  grammat ica l ly  the  o ther  words (subst~ings)  in  the  s t r ing .  That  
is to say that the right word (string) must form with another word 
~subet~iag) in the string an ordered pair belonging to a certain rela. 
tion accepted by the grammar of the language ~.  In the graphical 
representation suggested above, the right word (subst~,ng) must 
find itself on a continuous path with the other words (substr~gs) 
contained in the translation of the sentence under consideration, 
For example, let L I be the Englis~language and ~ the 
French. Let the sentence in L I be "we see the bo~'. It must be

ponding par ts  of  the  Eng l i sh  and French graphs,  and marking by do~ 
ted l ines  the mapping de f ined  in  the d ic t ionary ,  we can draw fo r

There are cases when the condition of gra~latioality is. not 
sufficient. Then a human translator,uses supplementary information, 
like general knowledge of the subject treated in the text, style used 
etc. Graphically, such information may be taken into account, for 
example, by assigning different colours to different types of subject 
Then the diagram must close through paths of different colour.

13 .  ELECTRICAL TRANSLATION. Let us assume now that we have 
at our disposal an electrical analogue N(L I) of the language ~,  
and an electrical analogue N(~)  of the language L 2. We can 
further immaglne such an electrical connexion between the two ana- 
lo~-ues that when a contact "ai" closes in N(LI) ~ all contacts cor- 
responJding to the different possible translations of "ai" indica- 
ted by the dictionary ~-~2 are closed in N(L2). Then, when a con- 
tinuous path of contacts is closed in N(L I) , its translation can 
be only a continuous path resulted in N(L2). For the selection 
pf ~he type of subject or of the style used, we can devise a switch 
that makes only the corresponding connections between N(L I) and 
N(~) ,  o r  in  N(~)  and  N(L 2)  themse lves .  Such a mwitch may have ,  
fo r  ex~np le ,  pos i t ions  marked ? l i te ra ture ,  mechan ics ,  e lec t r i c i ty ,  
e lec t ron ics ,  chemis t ry ,  med ic ine  e tc .  
Some texts  may conta in  su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  to  enab le  the  
above swi tch  to  f ind  automat ica l ly  i t s  r ight  pos i t ion .  Th is  idea  
~serves  an ent i re ly  separate  d i scuss ion .  
14.  CONCLUDING R~ARKS. What was suggested  under  13 and 1@ 
are  in  fac t  examples  o f  cab led  log ic .  The imp lementat ion  of these  
ideas  fo r  an  ent i re  language may encounter  t remenduous  techn ica l  
difficulties. Designing graphs and electrical analogues for limited 
parts of language may prove however useful for demonstrational pur- 
poses. Thus it would be possible to achieve other models of language 
understanding and translation than those provided by digital pro- 
grams and cunputers. The author feels that this is indeed interes- 
ting, far as explained by ZIERE~ \[9~ ~ the process of understanding 
must not be actually as divided into elementary steps as in an algo- 
x~thm -- "Dazu kommt noch dass beim Verstehen der gesprochenen Spra- 
che dutch den Menschen auch der soziale Kontext und das Erlebnis- 
verm~en des Menschen zum Abbau der angebotenen Information bei~gt.
