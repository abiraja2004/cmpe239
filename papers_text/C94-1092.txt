The llank of English is an international English hm- 
guage project sponsored by llarper-Collins Publish- 
ers, Glasgow, and conducl;ed by the COBUILD team 
at the University of Birrnhlgham, UK. The text hank 
will comprise some 200 million words of both written 
and spoken English. The whole 200 million word co l  
pns is being annotated morphologically and syntacti- 
cally during 1993-94 at the Research Unit for Cor,,- 
Imtat ional  Linguistics (IL/I(3L), University of Ilel- 
sinkl, using the Fmglish nmrphological nalyser (ENC,- 
TW()I,) and English Constraint (:h'ammar (EN(:I(:.'(:~) 
parser. The first half of the texts (103 mill ion words) 
has ah'eady been processed in 1993. The project is 
lead by Prof. 3ohn Sinchdr in Birmingham, and l'rof. 
Fred Karlsson in Ilelsinld. The present author is re- 
sponsible for conducting the annotation. 
In the introdnction of this paper the r,.:mtines Ibr 
dealing with htrge text corpora are presented and 
our analysing system outlined. Chapter 2 gives an '  
overlook how the texts are preprocessed. Chapter 
3 descrihes the lexicon updating, which is a prelim- 
inary step to the analysis. The last part presents the 
li;N(:'C(~ parser and the ongoing developtnel,t of it.s 
syntactic ornponent. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Each rno,fl.h the (~OBUILI) tean-i supplies an apl)rox- 
imately 10 million word b;ttch of lw:trl~.tlp coded run- 
ning text (see Appendix A) in ASCII format. Every 
new batch is lh'st scanned by the EN(TI'WOI, lexi- 
eel and rnorphological nalyser \[Koskentdetni, 1!.183\] 
in filtering rhode for the purpose of detecting words 
not inchaled in the present lexicon. This is followed hy 
a semi-autou-mtic lpdal.illg of the lexicon. After these 
ad,iustments, the whole sysl.em is used for annol.at.ing; 
the data. 
()ur mmlyslng system, which is presented in del.ail 
in \[Karlsson, 19{),1\], consists of the following successive 
sLages: 
? preprocessing 
? EN(V\]'WOL lexical analysis 
? EN(:K~G morl~hological disambiguation 
? ENGC(.-I syntactic mapping and disamhiguation 
'\]'he main routines performed on the rnonthly data, 
includitlg constant monitoring of hoth inconting 
texts and ~malysed output and management (doc- 
umentation, backul~S ) are closely linked to the hi)- 
dating of the preprocessing module and the EN(L 
TWOL lexicon.

3 THE LEX ICON 
Filtering produces a list of all tokenised word-forms 
in the input text which are not included in the cur- 
rent ENGTWOL lexicon. The most eon-nnon types 
are taken nnder closer scrutiny. It has to be decided 
whetlier these are genuine word forms or non-words 
(e.g. misspellings). 
At the begimfing, I used several (I;tys to update the 
lexical module for a new batch of text but experi- 
ence and increased coverage of the lexicon haw~ di- 
minished the time needed tbr this task considerably. 
\[ have added words above a certain frequency rou- 
tinely to the ENG'I'WOL lexicon. The fi'equency 
is no~ fixed but de~ermined by practical considera- 
tions. For instance, when the data contain a great, 
deal of duplication (as in l, he BBC material owing 
to the repetitive nature of daily broadcasting), sim- 
ple token fl.equency is a poor indicator of what is a 
suigable item to add to the lexicon. IIowever, sarn- 
piing methods have not heen developed t.o optimise 
the size of the lexicon, beea/ise it is not crucial for 
the present purpose. 
My lexieal practices differ sornewhat fi.om the 
updating procedure doeurnented in \[V'outilain,'n, 
1994\]. If our aim is to SUpl)ly every word in run- 
ning text; with all prol)er rnorphological and syn- 
tactic readings, we c,'Lnllot deprive frequent IlOll- 
standard words (e.g. htrn, veggie, wanna) of their 
obvious morphological readings because this might 
cause the whole sentence to be misanalysed. Siuce 
prescriptive considerations were not taken into ae- 
eotmt in the design of ENGTWOI,, many el~t.rles 
marked as informal' or lang' in conventional dic- 
tionaries were added to the lexicon. I have also 
included highly domain-specific entries into the lex- 
icon if they were frequent enough in certain types 
of data, especially when heuristics might produce 
erroneous or incomplete analyses for the word in 
question (e.g. species of fish which have the saule 
form in singular and plural: brill, chub, ?laTfish) t . 
()he advantage of iucluding all frequetfl, gralfldeal 
words tO the lexicon is that EN(TFWOL filterlnl2; of 
incornitlg texts produces output which can he more 
reliably dealt with by autoulatic nleaus. \Vh,m :111 
frequent nonstandard and even foreign words are 
listed in the lexicon, the otttput can be used in a 
straightforward way for generating new entries. 
The procedure of adding new entries to the lexicon 
goes its follows: first, all words are classified aec?~rd- 
ing to the part-of-speech they belong to. Second, 
new entries in the ENGTWOL format are generat.ed 
automatically from these word-lists using ready- 
made tools presented in \[Voul.ihfiuen, 1994\]. Lists or 
new entries are carefully checked up, and additiolml 
feat.ures (such as transiLivity and complemenl;ation 
IThe default category of morphological heuristics is :t 
singular Iioun. ht the case of a potential plural form (s- 
ending), au underspecified tag S(I/PL is given. 
Datures for verbs) a.re suPl)tied rnannally. In de- 
scribing the items, 1 h;we relied mainly oil Collins 
COIIUII, D \[)ietionary (i.?)87) and Collins English 
Dictionary (19.?11) which have been avaihible for us 
ill electronic form. Ilut when the usage a.nd dis- 
tribution seems to be /lllelea.r, \[ have generated an 
on-line concordance directly from the corpus..qlnee 
I have dealt with words which have a frequency of, 
say, at, least 10 tokens in the corpus, tJfis method 
seems to be quite reliable. 
We cannot detect errors ill the lexicon during the 
initial liltering phase. ()nee a certain string has had 
one or more entries in the lexicon, it is not present 
in the output of the filtering, and other potential 
uses might not. be added to the lexicon ~. And fi'e- 
qllent errors telld to get., corrected since all incorrect 
analyses detected uring the manual iuspee(.ion a.re 
corrected irectly it, the lexicon. 
The I'\]NCI'I'W()I, lexicon which is used in the 
Bank analyses contains al\]proxlnmLely 75,0{}{} en- 
tries. Morphological analysis caters for all inflected 
forlns el' the lexical items. 'Fhe coverage of I.he lexi- 
con bel'?n'e updating is between 97% - 98% of all 
wo\['d-fclrtll toketls ill l'llllllitlg text. Al~pemlix A 
presents the nurnber of additional lexical eutries 
generated from each bateh of daLa. The cumula- 
lave treml shows that a w~ry small nurnber c+f new 
entries is needed when analysing the hll.ter half of 
the corpus. 
Morphc, logical heuristics is applied afl.er I'3NG- 
TWOI, analysis as a separate module (by Voul.i- 
laiuen, Tapanainen). It assigns reliable analyses to 
words which were not: iueluded iu I,he lexicon. This 
also coutril)utes to the fact; that lexicon updating 
will be a minor task ill the future.
