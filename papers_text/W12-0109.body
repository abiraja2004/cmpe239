1 Introduction 
PLUTO is a commercial development project 
supported by the European Commission as part 
of the FP7 programme which aims to eliminate 
the language barriers that exist worldwide in the 
provision of multilingual access to patent infor-
mation. The project consortium comprises four 
partners: the Centre for Next Generation Locali-
sation at Dublin City University,1 ESTeam AB,2 
CrossLang, 3  and the Dutch Patent Information 
User Group (WON).4 Research and development 
is carried out in close collaboration with user 
groups and intellectual property (IP) profession-
als to ensure solutions and software are delivered 
that meet actual user needs. 
1.1 The need for patent translation 
The number of patent applications filed 
worldwide is continually increasing, with over 
1.8 million new filings in 2010 alone. Yet De-
spite the fact that patents are filed in dozens of 
different languages, language barriers are no ex-
cuse in the case of infringement. When carrying 
our prior-art and other searches IP professionals 
must ensure they include collections which en-
compass all potential relevant patents. Such 
searches will typically return results ? a set of 
patent documents ? 30% of which will be in a 
foreign language. 
As professional translation for patents is such 
a specialist task, translators command a premium 
fee for this service, often up to ?0.50 per word 
for Asian languages. This often results in high or 
unworkable translation costs for innovators. 
While free machine translation (MT) tools such 
as Google translate have unquestionably been 
beneficial in helping to reduce the need to resort

to expensive human translation, the quality is 
still often inadequate as the models are too gen-
eral to cope with the intricacies of patent text. 
In what follows, we will provide an overview 
of some of the technologies being developed in 
PLUTO to address the need for higher quality 
MT solutions for patents and how these are de-
ployed for the benefit of IP professionals. 
2 Language Technology for Patents 
Patent translation is a unique task given the 
style of language used in patent documents. This 
language, so-called ?patentese?, typically com-
prises a mixture of highly-specific technical ter-
minology and legal jargon and is often written 
with the express purpose of obfuscating the in-
tended meaning. For example, in 2001 an inno-
vation was granted in Australia for a ?Circular 
Transportation Facilitation Device?, i.e. a wheel.5 
Patents are also characterised by a prolifera-
tion of extremely long sentences, complex chem-
ical formula, and other constructs which make 
the task for MT more difficult. 
2.1 Domain-specfic machine translation 
The patent translation systems used in 
PLUTO have been built using the MaTrEx MT 
framework (Armstrong et al., 2006). The systems 
are domain specific in that they have been 
trained exclusively using parallel patent corpora. 
A number of experiments related to domain ad-
aptation of the language and translation models 
have been carried out in the context of these sys-
tems. The principal findings from this work were 
that systems combining all available patent data 
for a given language were preferable (Ceausu et 
al. 2011).

Significant pre-processing techniques are also 
applied to the input text to account for specific 
features of patent language. For instance, sen-
tence splitting based on the marker hypothesis 
(Green, 1979) is used to reduce long sentences to 
more manageable lengths, while named-entity 
recognition is applied to isolate certain struc-
tures, such as chemical compounds and refer-
ences to figures, in order to treat them in a 
specific manner. 
Additionally, various language-specific tech-
niques are used for relevant MT systems. For 
example, a technique called word packing (Ma et 
al., 2007), is exploited for Chinese?English. 
This is a bilingually motivated task which im-
proves the precision of word alignment by ?pack-
ing? several consecutive words together which 
correspond to a single word in the corresponding 
language.  
Japanese?English is a particularly challeng-
ing pair due to the divergent word ordering be-
tween the two languages. To overcome this, we 
employ preordering of the input text (Talbot et 
al. 2011) in order to harmonise the word ordering 
between the two languages and reduce the likeli-
hood of ordering errors. This is done using a 
rule-based technique called head-finalisation 
(Isozaki et al., 2010) which moves the English 
syntactic head towards the end of the phrase to 
emulate the Japanese word order. 
Finally, we use compound splitting and true 
casing modules for our English?German MT 
systems in order to reduce the occurrence of out-
of-vocabulary words. 
2.2 Translation memory integration 
In order to further improve the translation 
quality, we are developing an engine to automat-
ically combine the outputs of the MT system and 
a translation memory (TM). 
The engine works by taking a patent docu-
ment as input and searching for full matches on 
paragraph, sentence, and segment (sub-
sentential) level in the TM. If no full matches are 
found, fuzzy matches are sought above a prede-
termined threshold and combined with the output 
of the MT system using phrase- and word-level 
alignment information. 
For patents, most leverage from the TM is 
seen at segment level, particularly as the patent 
claims are often written using quite a rigid struc-
ture. This is due to that fact that, as patents typi-
cally describe something novel which may never 
have been written about previously, there is often 
little repetition of full sentences. 
2.3 Evaluation 
The performance of the patent MT systems in 
PLUTO is evaluated using a range of methods 
aimed not only at gauging general quality, but 
also identifying areas for improvement and rela-
tive performance against similar systems. 
In addition to assessing the MT systems using 
automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU 
(Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee 
et al. 2005), large-scale human evaluations are 
also carried out. MT system output is ranked 
from 1?5 based on the overall quality of transla-
tion, and individual translation errors are identi-
fied and classified in an error categorisation task. 
On top of this standalone evaluation, the 
PLUTO MT systems are also benchmarked 
against leading commercial systems across two 
MT paradigms: Google Translate for statistical 
MT and Systran (Enterprise) for rule-based MT. 
A comparative analysis is carried out using both 
the automatic and human evaluation techniques 
described above. This comparison is also applied 
to the output of the PLUTO MT systems and the 
output of the integrated TM/MT system in order 
to quantify the improvements achieved using the 
translation memories. 
The main findings from the first round of 
evaluations for our French?English and Portu-
guese?English systems showed that our MT 
systems score relatively high based on human 
judgments -- 3.8 out of 5 on average -- while be-
ing ranked higher than the commercial systems 
approximately 75% of the time. More details on 
these experiments can be found in Ceausu et al. 
(2011). 
3 Patent Translation Web Service 
The PLUTO MT systems are deployed as a 
web service (Tinsley et al., 2010). The main en-
try point for end users is through a web browser 
plugin which allows them to access translations 
on-the-fly regardless of the search engine being 
used to find relevant patents. In addition to the 
browser plugin, users also have the option to in-
put text directly or upload patent documents in a 
number of formats including PDF and MS Word. 
A number of further natural language pro-
cessing techniques are exploited to improve the 
user experience. N-gram based language identifi-
cation is used to send input to the correct MT 
system; while frequency based keyword extrac-
70
tion provides users with potentially important 
terms with which to carry out subsequent search-
es. 
Corresponding source and target segments are 
highlighted on both word and phrase level, while 
users have the option of post-editing translations 
which are stored in a personal terminology data-
base and applied to future translations. 
The entire framework has been designed to 
facilitate the patent professional in their daily 
workflow. It provides them with a consistency of 
translation quality and features regardless of the 
search tools being used to locate relevant patents. 
This has been validated through extensive us-
er experience testing which included a usability 
evaluation of the translation output.  
4 Looking Forward 
The PLUTO project has been running for just 
over two years and is scheduled to end in March 
2013. Our goal by that time is to have established 
a viable commercial offering to capitalize on the 
state-of-the-art research and development into 
automated patent translation. 
In the meantime, we will continue to build 
upon our existing work by building MT systems 
for additional language pairs and iteratively im-
proving upon our baseline translation perfor-
mance. Significant effort will also be spent on 
optimising the integration of translation memo-
ries with MT using techniques such as those de-
scribed in He et al. (2011).
