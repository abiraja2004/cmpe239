Abstract
In this paper we describe the system used to
participate in the sub task 5b in the Phrasal Se-
mantics challenge (task 5) in SemEval 2013.
This sub task consists in discriminating lit-
eral and figurative usage of phrases with
compositional and non-compositional mean-
ings in context. The proposed approach is
based on part-of-speech tags, stylistic features
and distributional statistics gathered from the
same development-training-test text collec-
tion. The system obtained a relative improve-
ment in accuracy against the most-frequent-
class baseline of 49.8% in the ?unseen con-
texts? (LexSample) setting and 8.5% in ?un-
seen phrases? (AllWords).
1 Introduction
The Phrasal Semantics task-5b in SemEval 2013
consisted in the discrimination of literal of figura-
tive usage of phrases in context (Korkontzelos et al,
2013). For instance, the occurrence in a text of the
phrase ?a piece of cake? can be used whether to re-
fer to something that is pretty easy or to an actual
piece of cake. The motivation for this task is that
such discrimination could improve the quality and
performance of other tasks like machine translation
and information retrieval.
This problem has been studied in the past. Lin
(1999) observed that the distributional characteris-
tics of the literal and figurative usage are different.
Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) showed that the similar-
ities among contexts are correlated with their literal
or figurative usage. Birke and Sarkar (2006) clus-
tered literal and figurative contexts using a word-
sense-disambiguation approach. Fazly et al (2009)
showed that literal and figurative usages are related
to particular syntactical forms. Sporleder and Li
(2009) showed that for a particular phrase the con-
texts of its literal usages are more cohesive than
those of its figurative usages. Inspired by these
works and in a new observation, we proposed a set or
features based on cohesiveness, syntax and stylom-
etry (Section 2), which are used to train a machine
learning classifier.
The cohesiveness between a phrase an its context
can be measured aggregating the relatedness of the
context words against the target phrase. This cohe-
siveness should be high for phrases used literally.
Conversely, figurative usages can occur in a large
variety of contexts implying low cohesiveness. For
instance, the cohesiveness of the phrase ?a piece of
cake? against context words such as ?coffee?, ?birth-
day? and ?bakery? should be high. The distribu-
tional measures used to obtain the needed related-
ness scores and the proposed measures of cohesive-
ness are presented in subsection 2.1.
Moreover, we observed a stylistic trend in the
training data set. That is, figurative usage tends to
occur later in the document in comparison with the
literal usage. Consequently, a small set of features
that exploits this particular observation is proposed
in subsection 2.2.
Fazly et al (2009) showed that idiomatic phrases
composed of a verb and a noun (e.g. ?break a leg?)
differ from their literal usages in the use of some
syntactic structures. For instance, idiomatic phrases
are less flexible in the use of determiners, pluraliza-
114
tion and passivization. In order to capture that no-
tion in a simple way, a set of features form a part-
of-speech tagger was included in the feature set (see
subsection 2.3).
In Section, additional details of the proposed sys-
tem are provided jointly with the obtained official
results. Finally, in sections 4 and 5 a brief discus-
sion of the results and some concluding remarks are
presented.
2 Features
Each instance of the training and test sets consist of a
short document d where one or more occurrences of
its target phase pd are annotated. For each particular
phrase p, several instances are provided correspond-
ing to literal or figurative usages. In this section, the
set of features that was extracted from each instance
to provide a vectorial representation is presented.
2.1 Cohesiveness Features
Let?s start with some definitions borrowed from the
information retrieval field: D is a collection of doc-
uments, df(w) is the number of documents in D
where the word w occurs (document frequency),
df(w ? pd) is the number of documents where w
and a target phrase pd co-occur, tf(w, d) is the num-
ber of occurrences of w in a document d ? D (term
frequency), and idf(w) = log2
df(w)
|D| is the inverse
document frequency of w (Jones, 2004).
A simple distributional measure of relatedness be-
tween w and p can be obtained with the following
ratio:
R(w, p) =
df(w ? pd)
df(w)
(1)
Pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church and
Hanks, 1990) is another distributional measure that
can be used for measuring the relatedness of w and
p. The probabilities needed for its calculation can be
obtained by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE):
P (w) ? df(w)|D| , P (pd) ?
df(pd)
|D| and P (w ? pd) ?
df(w?pd)
|D| .
Thus, PMI is given by this expression:
PMI(w, pd) = log2
(
P (w ? pd)
P (w) ? P (pd)
)

F9:
?

F10:

w?d? (tf(w, d) ? idf(w))
F11:
?

F12:

?
w?d? (tf(w, d) ? R(w, pd) ?NPMI(w, pd))
F19:
?
w?d? (tf(w, d) ? idf(w) ? PMI(w,pd))
F20:
?
w?d? (tf(w, d) ? idf(w) ?NPMI(w,pd))
Table 1: Cohesiveness features
Furthermore, the scores obtained through eq. 2
can be normalized in the interval [+2,0] with the fol-
lowing expression:
NPMI(w, pd) =
PMI(w, pd)
? log2(P (w ? pd))
+ 1 (3)
A measure of the cohesiveness between a docu-
ment d against its target phrase pd, can be obtained
by aggregating the pairwise relatedness scores be-
tween all the words in d and pd. For instance, us-
ing eq. 1 that measure is
?
w?d? R(w, pd), where d
?
is the set of different words in d. The equations 1,
2 and 3 can be used as weights associated to each
word, which can also be combined among them and
with tf and idf weights. Such weight combinations
produce measures that can be used as cohesiveness
features for a document. The set of 20 features ob-
tained using this approach is shown in Table 1.
2.2 Stylistic Features
The set of stylistic features related to the document
length, vocabulary size and relative position of the
occurrence of the target phrase in a document is
shown in Table 2.

F21: Relative position of pd in d
F22: Document length in characters
F23: Document length in tokens
F24: Number of different words
Table 2: Stylistic features
2.3 Syntactic Features
The features F25 to F67 correspond to the set of 43
part-of-speech tags of the NLTK English POS tag-
ger (Loper and Bird, 2002). Each feature contains
the frequency of occurrence of each POS-tag in a
document d.
3 Experimental Setup and Results
The data provided for this task consists of two data
sets LexSample and AllWords, which are divided
into development, training and test sets. Neverthe-
less, we considered a single training set aggregat-
ing the development and training parts from both
data sets for a total of 3,230 instances. Each train-
ing instance has a class label whether ?literally? or
?figuratively? depending on the usage or the tar-
get phrase. Similarly, the aggregated test set con-
tains 1,112 instances, but with unknown values in
the class attribute.
Firstly, the syntactic features for each text were
obtained using the POS tagger included in the NLTK
v.2.0.4 (Loper and Bird, 2002). Secondly, all texts
were preprocessed by tokenizing, lowecasing, stop-
word removing, punctuation removing and stem-
ming using the Porter?s algorithm (1980). This pre-
processed version of the texts was used to obtain the
remaining cohesiveness and stylistic features. The
resulting vectorial data set was used to produce the
predictions labeled ?UNAL.RUN1? through a Lo-
gistic classifier (Cessie and Houwelingen, 1992).
The implementation used for this classifier was the
included in WEKA v.3.6.9 (Hall et al, 2009). The
accuracies obtained by the different feature groups
in the training set using 10-fold cross validation are
shown in Table 3. The last column shows the per-
centage of relative improvement of different feature
sets combinations from the most frequent class base-
line to our best system using all features.
The predictions labeled ?UNAL.RUN2? were ob-
tained with the same vectorial data set but adding

as a nominal feature the target phrase of each in-
stance. The official results obtained by both sub-
mitted runs are shown in Table 4. Note that official
results in the test set are reported separately for the
data sets LexSample and AllWords. The LexSample
test set contains instances whose target phrases were
seen in the training set (i.e. unseen contexts). Un-
like LexSample, AllWords contains instances whose
target phrases were unseen in the training set (i.e.
unseen phrases).
4 Discussion
As it was expected, the results obtained in the ?un-
seen context? setting were consistently better than
in ?unseen phrases?. This result suggests that the
discrimination of literal and figurative usage heavily
depends on particular idiomatic phrases. This can
also be confirmed by the best accuracy obtained by
RUN2 compared with RUN1 in LexSample. Clearly,
the classifier used in RUN2 exploited the identifica-
tion of the phrase to leverage a priori information
about the phrase such as the most frequent usage.
Another factor that could undermine the results in
the ?unseen phrases? setting is the low number of in-
stances per phrase in the AllWords test set, roughly a
third in comparison with LexSample. Given that the
effectiveness of the cohesiveness features depends
116
on the number of documents where the idiomatic
phrase occurs, the predictions for this test set relied
mainly on the less effective features, namely syn-
tactic and stylistic features (see Table 3). However,
this problem could be alleviated obtaining the distri-
butional statistics from a large corpus with enough
occurrences of the unseen phrases.
Besides it is important to note, that in spite of the
low individual contribution of the stylistic features
to the overall accuracy (3.5%), when these are com-
bined with the remaining features they provide an
improvement of 12.9% (see Table 3).
5 Conclusions
We participated in the Phrasal Semantics sub task 5b
in SemEval 2013. Our system proved the effective-
ness of the use of cohesiveness, stylistic and syn-
tactic features for discriminating literal from figura-
tive usage of idiomatic phrases. The most-frequent-
class baseline was overcame by 49.8% in the ?un-
seen contexts? setting (LexSample) and 8.5% in ?un-
seen phrases? (AllWords).
