ABSTRACT 
A nonlinear transmission line model of the cochlea (Zweig 1988) is proposed as the basis for a 
novel speech preprocessor. Sounds of different intensities, uch as voiced and unvoiced speech, are 
preprocessed in radically different ways. The Q's of the preprocessor's nonlinear filters vary with 
input amplitude, higher Q's (longer integration times) corresponding to quieter sounds. Like the 
cochlea, the preprocessor acts as a "subthreshold aser" that traps and amplifies low level signals, 
thereby aiding in their detection and analysis. 
? Speech preprocessors are important. Small improvements at the beginning of the recognition 
process can lead to substantial improvements bythe end. Resolving acoustic ambiguities decreases 
the number of possibilities that must resolved by higher level linguistic processing. 
? The past: Much has been learned about speech preproeessing from the inner ear of verte- 
brates. Historically, this approach dates back to Ohm (of Ohm's Law fame), Helmholtz (1863), 
and more recently to work at Bell Laboratories (Flanagan 1965). Even information about hearing 
mechanisms in lower vertebrates i  of interest because the sounds they analyze are qualitatively 
similar to speech. Many natural sounds, like speech, are created by exciting resonant systems 
either periodically or chaotically. Presumably speech sounds evolved to take advantage of preex- 
isting signal processing mechanisms in hearing. Past research as shown: 
1. The external and middle ears of humans act together as a linear acoustic filter that boosts 
high frequency sound by 6 dB/octave. The long-time average spectrum of speech is approx- 
imately the inverse of the product of the external and middle ear transfer functions (Zweig 
1987). Correspondingly, speech preprocessors outinely boost the high frequencies in speech 
by differentiating the acoustic signal. 
2. Ohm's acoustic law states that the cochlea analyzes ound by decomposing it into different 
frequency components. Current speech preprocessors all extract frequency information con- 
tained in sound by one of several methods - -  moving Fourier transforms, filter banks, or LPC 
analysis. 
3. The frequency-position map within the cochlea (Liberman 1982), like the psychoacoustically 
derived reel scale, is approximately linear at low frequencies and exponential t high frequen- 
cies. Speech preprocessors based on filter banks have the center frequencies of their filters 
equally spaced on the reel scale. LPC based preprocessors may also use the reel scale (e.g. 
the BBN system uses a "mel-cepstrum" analysis).

4. Cochlear filters are approximately constant bandwidth at low frequencies and constant Q at 
high frequencies (Kiang et al 1986). The bandwidths of filters in speech preprocessing filter 
banks follow this same arrangement. 
a The present: Vertebrate inner ears analyze sounds of differing intensities with different 
analysis systems. As a corollary, voiced and unvoiced speech are processed differently by the 
human inner ear. Correspondingly, differences in the acoustic structure of voiced and unvoiced 
speech are matched to  differences in their respective analysis systems. In particular, since the 
vocal tract is excited chaotically in unvoiced speech, unvoiced speech must by processed by each 
auditory filter for a longer time than voiced speech if the resonant modes (formants) of the vocal 
tract are to be extracted. The nonlinear auditory filters of the inner ear of both lower vertebrates 
and mammals have Q's that vary with input amplitude, with higher Q's (longer integration times) 
being used for quieter sounds. Current speech preprocessors are linear and use a single algorithm 
for all sounds, independent of their amplitude. Perhaps they shouldn't. 
Although there are many qualitative similarities in the way in which lower vertebrates and 
mammals hear, there are important differences in the functioning of their inner ears. The in- 
ner ear of lower vertebrates works as a nonlinear filter bank with approximately the same sound 
stimulating all hair cells which act as independent filters. In the mammalian inner ear, the in- 
dividual cellular components are strongly coupled, sound exciting them into collective traveling 
wave oscillations that deliver different stimuli to different hair cells (Zweig 1988). The sensitivity, 
resolution, and dynamic range of hearing in mammals are much greater than that in lower verte- 
brates. Although collective phenomena can give rise to qualitative differences in signal processing 
for these two classes of systems, similarities exist and a study of the simpler lower vertebrate inner 
ear is also informative. 
Lower vertebrates: The hair cell output voltage O(t) (relative to  its resting voltage) satisfies 
the second order nonlinear inhomogeneous differential equation (Lackner and Zweig 1988): 
where the diacritical dot denotes differentiation with respect to time, w is the angular frequency of 
the freely oscillating hair cell in the small amplitude linear limit, I ( t )  the input signal (transducer 
conductance), E a small constant, and a a nonlinear function of I, I, 0 ,  and 0. A linear second 
order filter, by comparison, has output O(t) satisfying: 
where the ai are constants. For sounds near the threshold of hearing, hair cell responses are linear 
and Eq. 1 reduces to Eq. 2. 
Information about the functional form of a ( I ,  I, O , 0 )  for the turtle has been determined from 
experiment (Lackner and Zweig 1988). A turtle hair cell acts as a nonlinear harmonic oscillator 
with the useful properties that its integration time, Q/w, increases with decreasing amplitude, 
and its output is compressed to lie within a limited range. 
Speech in noise should be preprocessed with a nonlinear filter bank modeled after the turtle 
inner ear to see if the formants of both voiced and unvoiced speech are clearer than formants 
obtained from a conventional filter bank. A preprocessor with two linear filter banks operating 
in parallel, and separately optimized for voiced and unvoiced speech, would be simpler but less 
effective thaa a preprocessor based on Eq. 1. (Two linear filter banks would not provide the 
formant sharpening created by the two tone suppression (Sachs and Kiang 1968) implicit in Eq. 
1.) 
Hair cells of lower vertebrates and mammals are active (energy producing) as well as non- 
linear. The implications of these active and nonlinear elements for signal processing in lower 
vertebrates may be determined from Eq. 1. The situation for mammals is both more complex 
and surprising. 
Mammals: The cochlea acts as an active nonlinear one-dimensional mechanical transmission 
line with time delayed feedback (Zweig 1988). The parameters defining the circuit elements 
vary gradually along the line. Each section of the line contains a negatively damped nonlinear 
harmonic oscillator stabilized by a negative feedback force whose strength is proportional to the 
displacement of the oscillator at a previous time. The time delay is proportional to the oscillator's 
period (with the proportionality constant approximately 143-). 
Nonlinearities arise through the dependence of damping and feedback strength on oscillator 
displacement. The damping increases and the feedback strength decreases with increasing oscil- 
lator displacement. The precise functional form of these nonlinearities, which become important 
at intermediate and high sound pressure levels (levels of voiced speech), is currently under in- 
vestigation. Preliminary results indicate that the nonlinearities provide at least three benefits: 
automatic gain control necessary for the analysis of speech whose components differ markedly in 
amplitude; sharpening of formants, making them easier to recognize in the presence of noise; and 
adjustment of filter bandwidths with amplitude so that quieter unvoiced portions of speech will 
have longer time windows (narrower filters) for their analysis than the louder voiced portions. 
In addition, the transmission line model possesses a remarkable mechanism for the amplifi- 
cation and analysis o /sound near threshold. This mechanism is related to another unexpected 
feature of the model: standing waves are generated in the cochlea at low sound pressure levels, 
not just traveling waves as first observed by von B4k4sey at high sound pressure levels. 
For example, a pure tone sets up a conventional forward traveling wave which moves from 
the stapes along the organ of Corti to its point of maximum displacement, the response to lower 
frequency tones peaking further down the cochlea. The active elements increase the amplitude of 
the forward traveling wave. This wave is partially reflected by spatial variations in the mechanical 
properties of the cochlea. The amplitude and phase of the backward traveling wave depend 
on the nature and spatial distribution of the mechanical inhomogeneities and the amplitude 
and phase of the forward traveling wave at its points of partial reflection. Contributions to 
the backward traveling wave are largest when they originate in the peak region of the forward 
traveling wave. The phase of the backward traveling wave changes monotonically as it propagates 
toward the stapes, and the active elements increase its amplitude. At the stapes the backward 
232 
traveling wave is partially reflected and then interferes with the incident forward traveling wave. 
If the interference is constructive, the forward traveling wave is reinforced, leading, in turn, to a 
larger backward traveling wave. The process of backward, and then forward, wave creation and 
amplification builds in this case a large standing wave, as first conjectured on general grounds by 
Kemp (1980). 
Thus, mechanical inhomogeneities and "stimulated emission" from the active regions of the 
cochlea lead to coherent amplification of the incident wave at stimulus frequencies where there is 
constructive interference at the stapes. If the incident sound is a pure tone, then increasing its 
frequency results in shifting the position of the maximum displacement towards the stapes, and 
the model predicts a concomitant alternation of constructive and destructive interference. The 
mechanical inhomogeneities and active elements are responsible for amplifying low level signals at 
certain frequencies, much like a "subthreshold laser", thereby increasing the overall sensitivity of 
hearing. The sound pressure level necessary for the detection of a pure tone is expected to vary 
in a cyclical fashion with frequency. Such microstructure in the hearing threshold curve is easily 
observed (Elliot 1958; Zweig 1973; Thomas 1975; Kemp 1979; Zwicker and Schloth 1984). 
The energy in the backward traveling wave not reflected at the stapes vibrates the middle 
ear bones and ultimately appears in the external ear canal as sound. Thus the model predicts the 
existence of "otoacoustic emissions," also in agreement with experiment (Kemp 1978). In fact, 
the maxima in the spectra of otoacoustic emissions correlate strongly with the periodic minima in 
the threshold hearing curve (Kemp 1979; Zwicker and Schloth 1984). As predicted by the model, 
the ear emits most loudly at those frequencies to which it is most sensitive. 
Spontaneous emissions, corresponding to certain mild cases of tinnitus (Kemp 1981), arise 
when the product of the magnitudes of the reflection and amplification factors exceeds unity and 
the traveling waves add coherently at the stapes. Spontaneous emissions are therefore xpected 
to occur at frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive, and in fact experimental measurements 
indicate that this is true (Zwicker and Schloth 1984). These emissions, once initiated, require no 
external sound for their maintenance; they are created by an oscillating biological "hydromechan- 
ical laser." The stapes acts as a partially reflecting mirror that feeds back energy to the cochlear 
amplifier in the form of a forward traveling wave. Both spontaneous and externally stimulated 
emissions are limited in amplitude by mechanical nonlinearities which prevent he formation of 
large standing waves at high sound pressure levels. 
Finally, at low amplitudes the energy of transients (e.g., clicks or the initial burst in unvoiced 
plosives) is also trapped and amplified within the cochlea. The energy that does leak out into 
the ear canal (an "echo" of the incident sound) has a frequency spectrum that peaks at those 
frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive (Zwicker and Schloth 1984). 
In contrast o mammals, lower vertebrates utilize different (and also remarkable) mechanisms 
that do not depend on collective phenomena to increase their sensitivity to sound, but their 
thresholds of hearing are much higher than those of mammals.

? The future: A number of nonlinear signal processing principles remain to be abstracted from 
the peripheral hearing process and applied to the design of speech preprocessors. The intensity- 
dependent induced emission of mechanical energy, and its coherent amplification at certain reg- 
ularly spaced frequencies through multiple reflections, provide a dramatic example of how the 
detection and analysis of sound in the cochlea depend on sound intensity. It also shows that the 
cochlea processes information in a surprising fashion through the collective action of many compo- 
nents. Enough experimental evidence already exists to indicate that nonlinear signal processing 
in the cochlea t intermediate and high sound pressure levels is also the product of collective hair 
cell action. Its mechanisms and effects promise to be both novel and effective in resolving acoustic 
ambiguities that currently plague conventional speech preprocessors.
