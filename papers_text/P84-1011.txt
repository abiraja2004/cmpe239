O. Abstract 
In this paper, we focus on the features of a 
lexicon for Japanese syntactic analysis in 
Japanese-to-English translation. Japanese word 
order is almost unrestricted and Kc~uio-~ti  
(postpos i t iona l  case  par t i c le )  i s  an impor tant  
device which acts as the case label(case marker)  
in Japanese sentences. Therefore case grammar is 
the most effective grammar for Japanese syntactic 
analysis. 
The case frame governed by )buc~n and having 
surface case(Kakuio-shi), deep case(case label) 
and semantic markers for nouns is analyzed here to 
illustrate how we apply case grammar to Japanese 
syntactic analysis in our system. 
The parts of speech are classified into 58 
sub-categories. 
We analyze semantic features for nouns and 
pronouns classified into sub-categories and we 
present a system for semantic markers. Lexicon 
formats for syntactic and semantic features are 
composed of different features classified by part 
of speech. 
As this system uses LISP as the programming 
language, the lexicons are written as S-expression 
in LISP. punched onto tapes, and stored as files 
in the computer. 
l .  Introductign 
The Mu-project is a national project 
supported by the STA(Science and Technology 
Agency), the full name of which is "Research on a 
Machine Translation System(Japanese - English> for 
Scientific and Technological Documents.'~ 
We are currently restricting the domain of 
translation to abstract papers in scientific and 
technological fields. The system is based on a 
transfer approach and consist of three phases: 
analysis, transfer andgeneration. 
In the first phase of machine translation. 
analysis, morphological analysis divides the 
sentence into lexical items and then proceeds with 
semantic analysis on the basis of case grammar in 
Japanese. In the second phase, transfer, lexical 
features are transferred and at the same time, the 
syntactic structures are also transferred by 
matching tree pattern from Japanese to English, In 
the final generation phase, we generate the 
syntactic structures and the morphological 
features  in English. 
2. Coac_~pt of_~_Deoendencv Structure based on 
Case Gramma\[_/n Jap_a_D~ 
In Japan, we have come to the conclusion that 
case grammar is most suitable grammar for Japanese 
syntactic analysis for machine translation 
systems. This type of grammar had been proposed 
and studied by Japanese linguists before 
Fillmore's presentation. 
As word order is heavily restricted in 
English syntax, ATNG~Augmented Transition Network 
Grammar) based on CFG~Context Free Grammar ) is 
adequate for syntactic analysis in English. On the 
other hand, Japanese word order is almost 
unrestricted and K~l!,jlio--shi play an important role 
as case labels in Japanese sentences. Therefore 
case grammar is the most effective grammar for 
Japanese syntactic analysis. 
In Japanese syntactic structure, the word 
order is free except for a predicate(verb or verb 
phrase) located at the end of a sentence. In case 
grammar, the verb plays a very important role 
during syntactic analysis, and the other parts of 
speech only perform in partnership with, and 
equally subordinate to. the verb. 
That is. syntactic analysis proceeds by 
checking the semantic compatibility between verb 
and nouns. Consequently. the semantic structure of 
a sentence can be extracted at the same time as 
syntactic analysis.

When semantic markers are recorded for nouns 
in the verbal case frames, each noun appearing in 
relation to l /2u(~'n and Kclkuio-shi in the sample 
text is referred to the noun lexicon.

for lexicon entry are given in Figure \]. 
For each verb ,  l<ctkuio-Mtt and Keiuoudoi~-_.shi,

4. Sub-cat~or_ies of Parts of SDeech

The parts of speech are classified into 13 
main categories: 
nouns, pronouns, numerals, affixes, adverbs. 
verbs .  ~eiy_ou- -~h~.  Ke~uoudou-shi.

category  i s  sub-c lass i f ied  and d iv ided  in to  56 
sub-categor ies (see  Appendix A); those  which are  
mainly based on syntactic features, and 
additionally on semantic features. 
For example, nouns are divided into 11 
sub-categories; proper nouns, common nouns, action 
nouns I (S~!tC~!--~jc i sh i ), action nouns 2 (others }. 
adverbial nouns. ~bk:?tio-shi-teki-i,~ishi (noun with

verbal nouns, because action noun \] is also used

Adverbs are divided into 4 sub-categories for 
modality , aspect and tense. In Japanese, the 
adverb agrees with the auxiliary verb. 
C~in~utsu-futu-shi agrees with aspect, tense 
and mood features of specific auxiliary verb, 
Joukuou-fz~u-shi agrees with aspect and 
tense, 
Teido-fuku-shi agrees with gradability. 
Auxiliary verbs are divided into 5 
sub-catagor ies  based on moda l i ty ,  aspect ,  vo ice ,  
c le f t  sentence and o thers .  
Verbs may be c lass i f ied  accord ing  to  the i r  
case frames and there fore  i t  i s  not  necessary  to  
sub-c lass i fy  the i r  sub-categor ies .  
5. Semantic Markimz of Nouna 
We analyze semantic features, and assign 
semantic markers to Japanese words classified as 
nouns and pronouns. Each word can give five 
possible semantic markers. 
The system of semantic markers for nouns is 
made up of tO conceptual facets based on 44 
semantic slots, and 38 plural filial slots at the 
end (see Figure 2 ).

intellectual activity in the human brain. This 
facet contsists of such semantic slots as Theory, 
Conceptual object. Sign/Symbol, etc. 
4) Part 
This conceptual facet contains parts: that 
is, structural parts, elements and contents of 
things and matter.

This conceptual facet contains attributes: 
that is, properties, qualities or features 
representative of things. This facet consists of 
semantic slots such as Property Characteristic. 
Status Figure, Relation, Structure, etc. 
6 Phenomenon 
This conceptual facet contains phenomena: 
that is, physical, chemical and social actions 
without human activity. This facet consists of 
semantic slots such as Natural phenomenon, 
Artificial phenomenon Experiment. Social 
phenomenon, Power Energy, etc. 
7, Doing or Action 
This conceptual facet contains human doing 
and actions. This facet consists of such semantic 
slots as Action Deed. MovementReaction, 
Effect Operation, etc. 
8: Mental activity 
This conceptual facet contains operations of 
the mind and mental process. This facet consists 
of semantic slots such as Perception. Emotion. 
RecognitionThought, etc. 
9.! Measure 
This conceptual facet contains measure: that 
is ,  the extent ,  quant i ty ,  amount or degree of  a 
thing. This facet consists of semantic slots such 
as Number. Unit, Standard, etc. 
10i Time and Space 
This conceptual facet contains space, 
topography and time. 
5.2 Process of semantic marking 
The semantic marker for each word is 
determined by the following steps. 
1) Determine the definition and features of a 
word. 2, Extract semantic elements from the word. 
3) Judge the agreement between a semantical slot 
concept and extracted semantical element word by 
word, and attach the cor respond ing  semantic 
markers. 4; As a result, one word may have many 
semantic markers. However, the number of semantic 
markers for one word is restricted to five. If 
there are plural filial slots at the end. the 
higher family slot is used for semantic 
featurization of the word. 
I t  i s  easy to dec ide semantic markers for  
techn ica l  and spec i f i c  words. But, i t  i s  not easy 
to mark common words, because one word has many 
meanings.

8. con__cJJ~i_o_n 
We have reached the opinion that it is 
necessary to develop a way of allocating semantic 
markers automatically to overcome the ambiguities 
in word meaning confronting the human attempting 
this task. 
In the same thing, there are problems how to 
find an English term corresponding to the Japanese 
technical terms not stored in dictionary, how to 
collect a large number of technical terms 
effectively and to decide the length of compound 
words, and how to edit this lexicon data base 
easily, accurately, safely and speedily. 
In lexicon development for a huge volume of 
You(~n , it is quite important that we have a way 
of collecting automatically many usages of verbal 
case frames, and we suppose it exist different 
case frames in different domains.
