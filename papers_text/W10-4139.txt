Abstract 
This paper describes the Chinese Word 
Segmenter for our participation in CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese 
word segmentation. We formalize the tasks 
as sequence tagging problems, and 
implemented them using conditional random 
fields (CRFs) model. The system contains two 
modules: multiple preprocessor and basic 
segmenter. The basic segmenter is designed as 
a problem of character-based tagging, and 
using named entity recognition and chunk 
recognition based on boundary to preprocess. 
We participated in the open training on 
Simplified Chinese Text and Traditional 
Chinese Text, and our system achieved one 
Rank#5 and four Rank#2 best in all four 
domain corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Word is a logical semantic and syntactic unit 
in natural language (Zhenxing Wang, 2008).  
Chinese word segmentation is very important for 
Chinese language processing, which aims to 
recognize the implicit word boundaries in 
Chinese text.  It is the foundation of most 
Chinese NLP tasks. In past decades, great 
success has been achieved in Chinese word 
segmentation (Nie, et al 1995; Wang et al 
2000;Zhang, et al 2002). But there still exist 
many problems, such as cross-domain 
performance of Chinese word segmentation 
algorithms. As the development of the internet, 
more and more new word has been appearing, 
Improving the  performance of Chinese word 
segmentation algorithms on OOV (Out-Of-
Vocabulary Word, is a word which occurs in the 
reference corpus but does not occur in the 
labeled training corpus) is the important research 
direction. Our system participated in the CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese word 
segmentation. And we have done work in dealing 
with two main sub-tasks: (1) Word Segmentation 
for Simplified Chinese Text, (2) Word 
Segmentation for Traditional Chinese Text. Our 
system formalizes these tasks as consecutive 
sequence tagging problems, and learns the 
segmentation using conditional random fields 
approach. Our system contains two modules, a 
multiple preprocessor and a basic segmenter. The 
multiple preprocessor first finds chunks based on 
boundary dictionary and then uses named entity 
recognition technology to extract the person, 
location, organization and special time. The basic 
segmenter using CRF model is trained to 
segment the sentence to word which contains one 
or more characters. The basic segmenter follows 
the study of Zhenxing Wang, Changning Huang 
and Jingbo Zhu (2008), but applies more refined 
features and tags.  
The reminder of the paper is organized as 
follows. In section 2, we briefly describe the task 
and the details of our system. The experimental 
results are discussed in section 3. In section 4 we 
put forward our conclusion. 
2 System Description  
In this section we describe our system in more 
detail. The Figure1 is the frame of our system. It 
contains two modules: multiple preprocessor and 
basic segmenter. 
 
2.1 Multiple Preprocessor 
The preprocessor contain two modules: 
chunking based on boundary dictionary and NE 
Reorganization.  
2.1.1 Chunking 
In one sentence, there are always some  
characters or  words, such as ???, ???,???,?
?? ?, the character adjacent them can not  
together with them. We define these characters 
or words as boundary word. We built a boundary 
dictionary manual, which contains about 100 
words. Once a  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure1. Chinese Word Segmenter 
 
sentence input, our system finds boundary words 
in the sentence first. For example, such as, ???
??????????????? 15?? 16
?????????????. In this sentence 
we can find the boundary word??? ??? ??? ?
?? ? ???. Then chunking result is shown 
below in Figure 2. Using ?[ ]? to mark up the 
chunks. 
 
[???]  ?  [?????]  ?  [????] 
??  ?  [15?]  ?  [16?]  ?  [????] 
[??????] 
Figure 2. a sentence with chunk in data set 
 
Chunking is very useful to improve the precision 
of segmentation. Especially when lacking 
enough training corpus for training CRF model. 
It can improve the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
word Recall and Precision on cross-domain 
Chinese word segmentation. 
 
2.1.2 NE Recognition 
We will recognize the named entities such as 
persons, locations organizations. We perform a 
process of the named entities recognition with 
forward-backward maximum matching algorithm 
based on entity dictionary. The dictionary 
contain location dictionary, person dictionary, 
family name dictionary, organization dictionary, 
country dictionary (Jianping Shen and Xuan 
Wang, 2010). For example, a sentence, ????
???????????????????
???????????. And  the processor 
will find out the location????,????, the 
family name ??? and person ????. The NE 
recognition result is shown below in Figure 3.

2.2 Basic Segmenter 
We model the segment task as the consecutive 
sequence labeling problems, such as chunking, 
and named entity recognition, and train the basic 
segmenter using conditional random fields 
approach (Lafferty et al, 2001). 
 
2.2.1 Conditional Random Fields 
CRF models are conditional probabilistic 
sequence and undirected graphical models 
CRF models hold two natures. First is the 
conditional nature, second the exponential nature. 
The conditional nature of the distribution over 
label sequence allows CRF models to model 
real-world data in which the conditional 
probability of a label sequence can depend on 
non-independent and interacting features of the 
observation sequence. The exponential nature of 
the distribution enables features of different 
states to be traded off against each other, 
weighting some states in a sequence as being 
more important than other states. Following 
Lafferty et al and Hanna Wallach, the 
exponential distribution chosen by John Lafferty 
et al is shown as follow: 
( ) (

In this situation, the parameters ',y y
?
and 
,y x? corresponding to these features are 
equivalent to the logarithms of the HMM 
transition and emission probabilities 
and . The parameter of the 
model can be estimated in many ways, such as 
GIS, IIS, L-BFGS etc.

2.2.2 Segment base on CRF model 
When a sentence or chunk (which get from the 
preprocessor) input, it will be split to the 
sequences shown in Figure 4.

Figure  4. Chunk and sequence 
Every character in input sentences will be 
given a label which indicates whether this 
character is a word boundary. Our basic 
segmenter is almost the same as the system 
described in (Zhao et al, 2006) which is learned 
from training corpus. The CRF model we use is 
implemented with CRF++ 0.51. The parameters 
of the CRF segmenter are set as defaults. 
Under the CRF tagging scheme, each 
character in one sentence will be given a label by 
CRF model to indicate which position this 
character occupies in a word. In our system, CRF 
tag set is proposed to distinguish different 
positions in the multi-character words when the 
word length is less than 6, namely 6-tag set {B, 
B2, B3, M, E, O}( Zhenxing Wang ,2008).We 
defined that B stands for the first and  E stands 
for  the last position in a multi-character word. S 
stands up a single-character word. B2 and B3 
stand for the second and the third position in a 
multi-character word. M stands for the fourth or 
more rear position in a multi-character word, 
whose length is larger than four-character. Then 
we add the entity tag set {B-entity, I-entity, E-
entity}. B-entity stands for the first character in a 
named entity, E-entity stands for the last 
character in a named entity, and I-entity stands 
for the other character in a named entity. 
We use a greedy forward procedure to select a 
better feature sets for the segementer according 
to the evaluation results in the development set. 
We first start from a basic feature set, and then 
add each feature outside the basic set and remove 
each feature inside the basic set one by one to 
check the effectiveness of each feature by the 
performance change in the development set. This 
procedure is repeated until no feature is added or 
removed or the performance is not improved. 
The selected features are listed below:  
? Cn (n=-2,-1, 0, 1, 2) 
? CnCn+1 (n=-1,0) 
? Cn-1CnCn+1 (n=-1,0,1) 
? Cn-2Cn-1CnCn+1  (n=0,1) 
Where C refer to the tag of each character, and 
C0 denotes current character and Cn(C-n) 
denotes the character n positions to the right (left) 
of current character.  
 
2.2.3 Post-processing 
We can obtain the preliminary results through 
the CRF model-based Segment, but there are 
some missed or incorrect cases for the digit, 
English word. For example ?the sighan? maybe 
segment to ?th e sig han?, so we will re-segment 
the ?th e sig han? as ?the sighan?. 
 
3 Performance and Analysis 
In this section we will present our 
experimental results for these two subtasks. For 
the Word Segmentation for Simplified Chinese 
Text subtask, comparing the performance of 
these four domains, we find that the performance 
of computer and finance are better than literature 
and medical.  We can find that the OOV RR of 
literature and medical are lower than the 
computer and finance. In the test data set, there 
are many Out-of-vocabulary(OOV), especially 
the disease. In medical domain, there are many 
diseases which do not appear in the corpus, and 
there is the proper name. The segment often 
can?t recognize disease well, so we add a post-
processing procedure, using domain dictionary 
for medicine, is used to increase the recall 
measure. The result for medical is shown in 
Table 2.

4 Conclusion 
Through the CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoff, we find 
our system is effective. And at the same time, we 
also find some problems of us. Our system still 
can?t performance very good in cross-domain. 
Especially the Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
recognition. From the experiment we can see that 
using domain dictionary is a good idea. In the 
future we will do more work in post-processing. 
The bakeoff points out the direction for us to 
improve our system.
