This is a report on the semantic dictionary for natural language 
processing we areconstructing now. This paper explains how to 
obtain the semantic information for the dictionary from an ordi- 
nary Japanese language dictionary with about 60,000 items (which 
had already been put into machine readable form) and also explains 
what should be the frame for the representation of meaning of each 
item (word). Then a man-assisted machine procedure that embeds 
the semantic graph with respect to the head word of the ordinary 
dictionary into the frame of a head word is discussed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
There are following two obstacles to the construction of a practical size semantic 
dictionary for natural language processing. One is that the number of words are 
so large that i t  is unknown from what and how to obtain semantic information 
necessary for the dictionary (tens of thousands general words should be accomo- 
dated). The other is that i t  is unknown how to seize and represent the meaning of 
each word. 
We are going to settle the problems as follows. For the f i r s t  problem, obtain the 
information necessary for the semantic dictionary from ordinary dictionary of 
Japanese language by analizing the sentences defining headwords. For the second 
problem, represent the meaning of a word by using the frame the structure of which 
has been studied extensively by us for a couple of decade (YOSHIDA (1982)). 
Figure I is the outline of the construction steps of the semantic dictionary. 
In this report we discuss, as preliminary stage of the construction, about the 
framing of the contents of the sentences defining words in the ordinary dictiona- 
ry. The discussions are to be held about the followings. 
(1) Features of the structure and the contents of the sentence defining (des- 
cribing the meaning of) a headword. 
(2) The use of semanticgraph as a scheme for the representation of meaning 
(structure) given by the sentence that define a head word in the ordinary dic- 
tionary. 
(3) The frame to represent the meaning of a word. 
(4) The way of embedding the information obtained from the semantic graph in the 
frame given by (3). 
(5) The way of obtaining the meaning (definition) of a word by unifying partial 
definitions" (given by (4)) concerning the word. 
2. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM AN ORDINARY JAPANESE LANGUAGE DICTIONARY AND 
FEATURES OF THE SENTENCES THAT DEFINE HEADWORDS 
We have chosen the medium size Japanese language dictionary (Shinmeikai Kokugo 
419 
420 S. YOSHIDA, H. TSURUMARU and T, HITAKA 
j i ten,  Published by Sanseido) to use for constructing the semantic dictionary. 
The reasons for the choice of this dictionary are as follows. 
(l) The number of headwords are adequate (about 60,000 items). 
(2) Had already been put into machine readable form. 
(3) Put emphasis on describing the meaning (signification) of a word by sentences, 
and avoided mere restatement in other words. 
(4) Tried to classify the meanings of words into several large groups and avoided 
useless small groups. 
Information that can be obtained from the dictionary are as follows. 
(1) Syntactic information such as part of speech, inflection and conjugation. 
(2) The described meaning of a headword. 
(3) Several classified meanings of a multivocal words. 
(4) Detailed meaning in its context and delicate shade of meaning of synonyms. 
(5) Synonym, antonym and idiom (idiomatic phrase). 
(6) Selection of significant words. 
The features of words definitions in the dictionary are as follows. 
(1) Symbols and abbreviations are used in place of sentences. 
e.g. ==~>... : make reference to . . .  ~ : the five conjugations of verbs 
( - - ) . . . :  antonym is . . .  ~ : adjective 
? .. : noun form i s - - .  ~? : German (language) 
(2) P-N type (Noun modified by Predicate) and N-N type (Noun modified by Noun) 
phrase are used extensively. 
(3) Words are abridged from the sentence into which the meaning is condensed, 
because of assuming the human use of the dictionary. 
(4) The meaning of a headword is defined by viewing i t  from some aspects or from 
its upper words (or synonyms). 
(5) When we look up in turn the upper words (or synonyms) of a headword, the ex- 
planation may be broken off, skipped or get into a cycle. 
3. SEt, ANTIC GRAPH REPRESENTATION OF A WORD DEFINITION 
The definition of a word should be given as accurately as possible in order to 
extract (meaning) information for the semantic dictionary from i t .  Thus the 
semantic graph is introduced for the representation of the word definition. The 
semantic graph which is a kind of semantic network consists of nodes (expressed 
by <.-.>) and arcs (or links; expressed by arrows) connecting the nodes. The 
semantic graph with respect to a word is the conceptual dependency graph of the 
sentence (called semantic graph of the sentence) defining the word. Nodes express 
the conceptual words (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives expressed with <...>) and 
arcs represent the relations between them. These relations are mainly given by 
the functions (called \]ink information) expressed by the relational words such as 
particles. 
Examples of relations or link information are : 'a kind of relat ion',  'case rela- 
t ion' ,  'cause-effect relat ion' ,  'synonym-antonym relat ion' ,  'mode', 'attr ibute' ,  
'state' An exmaple of the semantic graph which is derived from the definition 
sentence "~(drawing  paper) :~<k~?~B?~(whi te  and sl ightly thick 
paper for drawing a picture)" is shown in Fig.2. In Fig.2, relational words are 
shown expl ic i t ly  in Japanese which express the link information in the semantic 
graph. When the more detailed relation between words is needed, the relational 
information expressed by the relational word is transformed into the compound rela- 
tion between words such as in Fig.4. In Fig.4, a relational word "?~?"(prep. 
for: used for the purpose of) is transformed into the relation which contains 
some words ( ' ~  '(use) in this case) and the relation ('object' and 'for the 
purpose of ' ) .  In the process of obtaining the semantic graph from a sentence, i t  
becomes frequently necessary to supply additional information (expressed by addi- 
tional words and relations) to the sentence.

4. THE FP~AME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD DEFINITION 
What sorts of information as a meaning of the headword are extracted from the 
semantic graph derived from the def in i t ion  sentence in the ordinary Japanese dic- 
tionary? In the case of the semantic graph of a word ' i~  (drawing paper)' in 
Fig.3, fol lowing information are extracted, bv means of looking up the upper word 
'~(paper ) '  of 'drawing paper' and the l inked relat ions between 'paper' and the 
other words. @ drawing paper is a kind of paper ,@s l ight ly  thick,  ?white,@used 
for drawing a picture. These semantic information can be extracted from the seman- 
t i c  graph of the def in i t ions of a word 'paper' through the views 'a kind o f ' ,  
' a t t r ibute  (shape)', ' a t t r ibute  (co lor) '  and 'purpose of use'. Here, 'a kind of '  
is a re lat ion between 'drawing paper' and 'paper' .  Furthermore, from@, semantic 
information such that 'drawing paper' is the 'object (place)'  for  drawing a pic- 
ture' is obtained. This information denotes case re lat ionship between 'draw' and 
'drawing paper'. The above can be understood, from a d i f fe rent  point of view, 
that the meaning of a word 'drawing paper' is defined (described) from the views 
such as 'a kind of'  ( re la t ion) ,  ' case ' ( re la t ion) ,  a t t r ibute  (e.g. shape, color) 
and 'purpose of use' (basic view point) .  We are aiming at constructing the frame 
of a word def in i t ion  (cal led the frame of a word or the frame of def in i t ion)  by 
means of these views. What sorts of views should be prepared for the frame of a 
word? 
Concerning the frame we cleared that: 
(i) Words (to be exact, concepts) are classified into four types, that is, con- 
crete object, event, attribute (state) and abstract thing which are roughly corres- 
pond to concrete noun, verb, adjective/adverb and abstract word. Each word has 
the frame corresponding to its type. 
( i i )  The frame is made up of which consist of the semantic relations (such as, a 
kind of relationships, case relationships, cause-effect relationships and whole- 
parts relationships) and basic views. As basic views for 'product' thing (a kind 
of concrete object), we prepared ones shown in table 3. 
( i i i )  The frame for 'event' word is mainly made up of case relationships, cause- 
effect relationships, a kind of relationships and views of 'mode' (e.g. tense, 
possibil ity, in progress). These relationships are shown in tables l and 2. 
5. UNIFICATION PROCEDURE 
To give the fu l l  de f in i t ion  of a word, the part ia l  def in i t ions  given in the form of 
frames are unif ied into a hierarchical structure by the un i f icat ion procedure. 
The def in i t ions  of the comparatively upper words in the hierarchical  c lass i f i cat ion  
of the words should be given f ine meaning while lower words are only given of the i r  
special meanings, because the def in i t ion  inher i ts  from the upper words. An example 
of the def in i t ion  of a word 'drawing paper' (also, 'paper') is shown in Figs. 5and 
6, and also the def in i t ion  of a word ' f i re  extinguishing' is shown in Fig.7. In 
Figs.5, 6 and 7, the semantic information connected by the dotted l ines are 
inherited. In Fig.6, some words (e.g. ' s ta t ionary ' ,  ' instrument' ,  'product')  are 
skipped between 'paper' and ' th ing ' .  Therefore, i f  these words are looked up and 
related with 'paper' ,  the semantic information extracted from these words should 
be added to the def in i t ion .  There may be some shortage which can not be supplied 
only by these uni f icat ion procedures, so that i t  should be given man-assistedly 
f ine meanings to the comparatively upper words. For example, in Fig. ~ the agent 
of 'Remove' is 'Person' and result  of 'remove' is 'vanish' ,  therefore, also the 
agent of 'ext ingu ish ' ,  ' f i re  extinguishing' and so on can automatical ly be given 
i f  we have given the information in the f ine def in i t ion .  
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Although, in our prel iminary invest igat ion,  we have prospect o? using the ordinary 
dict ionary for the construction of the semantic dict ionary there are many problems 
422 S. YOSHIDA, H. TSURUMARU and T. HITAKA 
to be investigated, which contain followings. 
(1) Determination of the frames for abstruct noun and attribute(state). 
(2) Semantic level of the ~emantic graph. 
(3) Definitions of individual thing and event. 
(4) Development of the programs and supporting programs. 
(5) Definition of the technical terms.
