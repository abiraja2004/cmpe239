Abstract
We report two new approaches for building
scoring models used by automated speech
scoring systems. First, we introduce the Cu-
mulative Logit Model (CLM), which has been
widely used in modeling categorical outcomes
in statistics. On a large set of responses
to an English proficiency test, we systemati-
cally compare the CLM with two other scor-
ing models that have been widely used, i.e.,
linear regression and decision trees. Our ex-
periments suggest that the CLM has advan-
tages in its scoring performance and its robust-
ness to limited-sized training data. Second, we
propose a novel way to utilize human rating
processes in automated speech scoring. Ap-
plying accurate human ratings on a small set
of responses can improve the whole scoring
system?s performance while meeting cost and
score-reporting time requirements. We find
that the scoring difficulty of each speech re-
sponse, which could be modeled by the degree
to which it challenged human raters, could
provide a way to select an optimal set of re-
sponses for the application of human scor-
ing. In a simulation, we show that focusing
on challenging responses can achieve a larger
scoring performance improvement than sim-
ply applying human scoring on the same num-
ber of randomly selected responses.
1 Introduction
Automated assessment is a process by which com-
puter algorithms are used to score test-taker inputs,
which could be essays, short-text descriptions, read-
aloud sentences, or spontaneous speech responses
to open-end questions. Until recently, human scor-
ing has been predominantly used for scoring these
types of inputs. Several limitations of the human
scoring process have been identified in previous re-
search (Bennett, 2006). First, the human scoring
process is influenced by many hidden factors, such
as human raters? mood and fatigue conditions. In
addition, human raters may not strictly follow the
rubrics designed to guide the scoring process in their
practical scoring sessions. Furthermore, human rat-
ing is also an expensive and slow process, especially
for large-scale tests.
There has been an increasing number of studies
concerning the use of speech processing and natu-
ral language processing (NLP) technologies to auto-
matically score spoken responses (Eskenazi, 2009).
In these machine scoring systems, a set of features
related to multiple aspects of human speaking capa-
bilities, e.g., fluency, pronunciation, intonation, vo-
cabulary usage, grammatical accuracy, and content,
is extracted automatically. Then, statistical mod-
els, such as the widely used linear regression mod-
els, classification and regression trees (CART), are
trained based on human ratings and these features.
For new responses, the trained statistical models are
applied to predict machine scores.
The performance of current automated speech
scoring systems, especially for spontaneous speech
responses, still lags markedly behind the perfor-
mance of human scoring. To improve the perfor-
mance of automated speech scoring, an increas-
ing number of research studies have been under-
taken (Jang, 2009; Chen and Zechner, 2011; Chen
and Yoon, 2011). However, these studies have
mostly focused on exploring additional speech fea-
tures, not on building alternative scoring models.
Hence, in this paper, we will report on two new lines
of research focusing on the scoring model part of au-
73
tomated speech scoring systems. In particular, we
will introduce the Cumulative Logit Model (CLM),
which is not widely used in NLP, and compare it sys-
tematically with other widely-used modeling meth-
ods. In addition, we will propose a hybrid scoring
system inspired by the recent trend of involving hu-
man computation in machine learning tasks (Quinn
et al, 2010), which consists of both human scoring
and machine scoring to achieve a balance of scoring
accuracy, speed, and cost.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 reviews the previous research ef-
forts; Section 3 describes both the test from which
our experimental data were collected and the auto-
mated speech scoring system; Section 4 introduces
the Cumulative Logit Model (CLM) and reports a
systematic comparison with two other widely used
modeling approaches; Section 5 proposes using both
human scoring and machine scoring to achieve a
trade-off between scoring accuracy, speed, and cost,
and shows a simulation. Finally, Section 6 con-
cludes the paper and describes our plans for future
research.
2 Related Work
In the language testing field, it is critical how easily a
score can be interpreted by test takers and stakehold-
ers. Therefore, ?white-box? machine learning meth-
ods (mostly from the field of statistics) are favored
over black-box systems (e.g., neural networks) and
widely used in automated scoring systems. For ex-
ample, SRI?s EduSpeak system (Franco et al, 2010)
used a decision-tree model to automatically produce
a speaking score from a set of discrete score la-
bels. Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) has
been used in pronunciation evaluation (Hacker et
al., 2005). In a speech scoring system described by
Zechner et al (2009), a linear regression (LR) model
was used to predict human scores.
Applying linear regression, which is designed for
continuous outcomes, on ordinal outcomes, such as
discrete human rated scores, is questioned by some
statisticians.
A linear regression model does not ex-
ploit the fact that the scores can assume
only a limited number of values and hence
may provide inefficient approximations to
essay scores obtained by raters. Conse-
quently, estimation based on a model that
assumes that the response is categorical
will be more accurate than linear regres-
sion. A cumulative logit model, some-
times called a proportional odds model, is
one such model (Haberman and Sinharay,
2010).
The CLM was compared systematically with an
ordinary linear regression model in terms of au-
tomated essay scoring (Haberman and Sinharay,
2010). Based on their experiment on a large variety
of TOEFL prompts, they suggested that the CLM
should be considered a very attractive alternative to
regression analysis.
In recent years, a new trend of research in the ma-
chine learning field is to use human computation to
provide additional help, especially on difficult tasks.
For example, after the ESP game (Von Ahn, 2006),
an increasing number of human computation based
games emerged to use a large number of human par-
ticipants to solve many machine learning problems,
such as human identification for image processing
and sentiment annotation in natural language pro-
cessing (NLP). Quinn and Bederson (2011) review
research in this area. Furthermore, Quinn et al
(2010) proposed a hybrid mechanism to integrate
both human computation and machine learning to
achieve a balance between speed, cost, and quality.
In this paper, we will follow the advances in the
two directions mentioned above, including using
CML as a modeling method and obtaining comple-
mentary computing by integrating machine scoring
with human scoring to further improve the scoring
models in automated speech scoring systems.
3 Data and Automated Scoring System
3.1 Data
AEST is a large-scale English test for assessing test-
takers? English proficiency in reading, writing, lis-
tening, and speaking. The data used in our exper-
iments was collected from operational AEST tests.
In each test session, test takers were required to re-
spond to six speaking test questions to provide in-
formation or express their opinions.
Each spoken response was assigned a score in the
range of 1 to 4, or 0 if the candidate either made no
74
attempt to answer the item or produced a few words
totally unrelated to the topic. Each spoken response
could also receive a ?technical difficulty? (TD) label
when technical issues may have degraded the audio
quality to such degree that a fair evaluation was not
possible. Note that in the experiments reported in
this paper, we excluded both 0 and TD responses
from our analyses. The human scoring process used
the scoring rules designed for the AEST test. From
a large pool of certified human raters, two human
raters were randomly selected to score each response
in parallel. If two raters? scores had a discrepancy
larger than one point, a third rater with more expe-
rience in human scoring was asked to give a final
score. Otherwise, the final scores used were taken
from the first human rater in each rater pair.
The Pearson correlation r among human raters
was calculated as 0.64. The second human scores
had a correlation of 0.63 to the final scores while the
first human scores had a correlation of 0.99. This
is due to the fact that only in about 2% of the cases,
two human scores have a discrepancy larger than one
point. Table 1 describes the data size and final score
distribution of the four score levels.

3.2 Automated scoring system
To automatically score spontaneous speech, we used
the method proposed in Chen et al (2009). In this
method, a speech recognizer is used to recognize
non-native speech and a forced alignment is con-
ducted based on the obtained recognition hypothe-
ses. From the recognition and alignment outputs,
a number of features were extracted from multi-
ple aspects, such as the timing profiles, recogni-
tion confidence scores, alignment likelihoods, etc.
For speech recognition and forced alignment, we
used a gender-independent, fully continuous Hid-
den Markov Model (HMM) speech recognizer. Our
ASR system was trained from about 800 hours of
non-native speech data and its corresponding word
transcriptions. We extracted the following two types
of features, including (1) fluency and intonation
features based on the speech recognition output as
described in Xi et al (2008) and (2) pronuncia-
tion features that indicated the quality of phonemes
and phoneme durations as described in Chen et al
(2009).
4 A comparison of three machine learning
methods in automated speech scoring
We will briefly introduce CLM and then compare
it with two other widely used scoring methods, i.e.,
linear regression and CART. In most of the related
previous investigations, several machine learning al-
gorithms were compared using a fixed number of in-
stances. However, as shown in recent studies, such
as Rozovskaya and Roth (2011), judging an algo-
rithm requires consideration of the impact of the size
of the training data set. Therefore, in our exper-
iment, we compared three algorithms on different
sizes of training samples.
Let the response?s holistic score be Y = 1, 2, ...J
(J is 4 in our study on the AEST data) and let the
associated probabilities be pi1, pi2, ...piJ . Therefore
the probability of a predicted score is not larger than
j
P (Y ? j) = pi1 + pi2 + ...+ pij (1)
The logit of this probability can be estimated as
log
P (Y ? j)
1? P (Y ? j)
= ?j +
K?
k=1
?kXk (2)
where K is the number of speech features. We can
see that a CLM contains K ?s where each ? is asso-
ciated with one feature. In addition, for each score j,
there is an intercept ?j . The CLM is a special case
of multinomial logistic regression, which is named
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model (Berger et al,
1996) and is well known by NLP researchers. In
CLM, the ranking order of the labels being predicted
is emphasized. However, in MaxEnt models, there
is no assumption about the relationship of the labels
being predicted.
For CLM, we used the Ye?s VGAM R pack-
age (Yee, 2010) as our implementation. For or-
dinary linear regression and CART methods, we
used corresponding implementations in the WEKA
toolkit (Hall et al, 2009), i.e., lm and J48 tree,
through the RWeka package (Hornik et al, 2009)
so that we could run these three algorithms inside R.
75
From the available speech features, we first
run an inter-correlation analysis among these fea-
tures. Then, two feature selection approaches imple-
mented in the caret R package (Kuhn, 2008) were
used to select useful features from about 80 fea-
tures. First, all feature-pairs whose inter-correlation
was higher than 0.80 were analyzed and one feature
for each pair was removed. Next, a recursive fea-
ture elimination (RFE) based on a linear regression
model was utilized to reduce the feature size to just
20.
Using a stratified sampling based on the final
scores, the whole data set was split into a training set
(with 44, 830 instances) and a test set (with 4, 980
instances). Then, on a log10 scale, we tried using
increasing number of training samples from 100 to
104.5. For each training data set size, we randomly
selected the size of training samples from the train-
ing set, built the three models, and evaluated the
models on the entire test data. For each data set size,
such process was repeated 10 times. The evaluation
result is the averaged values from these 10 iterations.
We repeated the same experiment on the top 5, 10,
15, and 20 features. The evaluation metrics include
widely used measures in the field of automated scor-
ing, including Pearson correlation r and quadratic
weighted Kappa ? (hereafter weighted ?) between
the machine predicted scores and human final scores
in this data set.
Figure 1 shows the Pearson r and weighted ? val-
ues of the three methods vs. an increasing numbers
of training samples. We find that the CLM always
has the highest weighted ? value among these three
methods for each data size level. The CART per-
forms poorly, especially facing a limited number of
training samples. However, when the training data
size is large enough, the performance gap between
the CART and other regression models becomes
smaller. For two regression models, when work-
ing on 20 features, both Pearson r and weighted ?
values plateaued after reaching 1000 training sam-
ples. More importantly, we find that the CLM still
can provide a quite high value of weighted ? even
just using 100 training samples. This is very impor-
tant for automated assessments in cases where there
are not enough pre-test responses to fully train the
scoring model. When using other feature selections
(5, 10, and 15), we also observed the same trend as
shown in the Figure 1.

5 Utilizing human computation to support
automated speech scoring
On spontaneous speech responses, the performance
of automated scoring still lags behind human rat-
ings. For example, on the test set (4, 098 samples),
among human raters both the Pearson r and the
weighted ? values are about 0.6, much higher than
the best automated scoring results we saw in the pre-
vious section (around 0.5). There are many possi-
ble reasons for such a big performance gap between
automated speech scoring and human scoring. For
example, the automated features? lack of a measure-
ment of content accuracy and relevance might pro-
vide an explanation for part of the performance gap.
As a result, to our knowledge, there has not been any
commercial application of automated speech scoring
on high-stakes speaking tests to open-ended ques-
tions.
To further improve the speech scoring system?s
performance, inspired by Quinn et al (2010), we
76
propose to include human computation ? human
rating of speech responses ? in the automated
speech scoring system. Previously, there have been
some efforts to use human computation in auto-
mated speech scoring systems. For example, it is
well known that human scores were used to train au-
tomated scoring models. For essay scoring, an auto-
mated scoring system, e-rater, has been used to val-
idate the human rating process (Enright and Quin-
lan, 2010). One advantage of using both human and
e-rater to score is that about 10% of human rating
requests for double-scoring required in operational
essay scoring could be saved. However, there has
been no previous work investigating the joint use of
human scoring and machine scoring. By using these
two scoring methods together, we hope to achieve a
balance among scoring accuracy, speed, and cost.
From a total of N test responses, we need ask
humans to score m, where m << N . Therefore,
an important question concerning the joint use of
human scoring and machine scoring is how to find
these m responses so that the expensive and slow
human scoring process can provide a large perfor-
mance gain. In this paper, we will report our prelim-
inary research results of focusing on the responses
challenging to machine scoring process.
Since the responses used in this paper were se-
lected to be double-scored responses from a very
large pool of AEST responses, we use the rating
condition of each doubly-scored response to pre-
dict how challenging any given response is. For
speech responses for which two human raters gave
different holistic scores, we assumed that these re-
sponses were not only difficult to score for human
beings, but also for the machine learning method,
which has been trained from human scores in a su-
pervised learning way. We call the responses on
which two human raters agreed easy-case responses
and the responses on which two human raters dis-
agreed hard-case ones. Table 2 reports on the appli-
cation of trained automated speech assessment sys-
tems to these two types of responses. From the en-
tire testing set, human raters agreed on 3, 128 re-
sponses, but disagreed on 1, 852 responses. From
the training set described in the previous section,
we randomly sampled 1, 000 responses to train a
CLM model using those 20 features used in Sec-
tion 4. Then, the trained CLM model was evalu-
ated on these two types of responses, respectively.
Table 2 reports the evaluation metrics averaged on
20 trials of using different training set portions. We
can clearly see that the machine scoring has a sig-
nificantly better performance on the easy-case re-
sponses than the hard-case responses. Therefore, it
is natural to focus expensive/slow human computa-
tion efforts on these hard-case responses.

Table 2: Evaluation of automated speech assessment sys-
tems on two types of speech responses. For the responses
on which two human raters agreed, the machine has a sta-
tistically significantly better performance.
Suppose that we can obtain the type of each re-
sponse, hard-case vs. easy-case, in some way, we
then can focus our human scoring efforts on hard-
case responses only since machine scoring performs
much worse on them. Figure 2 depicts the re-
sults of one trial of using human scoring to replace
an increasing number of machine scores. Among
4, 980 responses in the test set, the blue curve shows
the weighted ? values after replacing an increasing
number of machine scores with human scores. Here,
we used the scores provided by the second rater from
each rater pair. This set of human scores had a Pear-
son r of 0.626 with the final scores. We also re-
placed the same number of responses, but without
distinguishing easy- and hard-case responses by the
corresponding human scores. The results are shown
in the red curve. We can observe that the weighted
? values increased from about 0.50, which was ob-
tained by using only machine scoring, to about 0.58
by asking humans to score all hard-case responses,
about 33% of all responses. Among the two meth-
ods to select the responses for using human scoring,
we can clearly see that the strategy of focusing on
hard-case responses can achieve higher weighted ?
when spending the same amount of human efforts as
the strategy of randomly selecting responses.

neous speech assessment. In the first experiment, we
systematically compared a new modeling method,
Cumulative Logit Model (CLM), which has been
widely used in statistics, with other two widely used
modeling methods, linear regression and CART.
We compared these three modeling methods on
a large test data set (containing 4, 980 responses)
and evaluated these methods on a series of train-
ing data sizes. The experimental results suggest
that the CLM model consistently achieves the best
performance (measured in Pearson r and quadratic
weighted ? between the predicted scores and human
rated scores). More importantly, we find that the
CLM can work quite well even when just using hun-
dreds of responses in the training stage. This finding
is especially important for building scoring models
when pre-test data is limited.
Although automated scoring has been designed to
overcome several disadvantages of the human rating
process, our experiments are meant to initiate sci-
entific debate on how best to combine the strengths
of human and automated scoringto achieve an opti-
mal compromise of scoring accuracy, cost, and time.
At least for current automated scoring systems for
spontaneous speech, the machine performance lags
behind the reliability of the human rating process.
We also found that the automated system performed
worse on hard-case responses on which even two hu-
man raters did not agree. In a simulation study, we
showed that jointly using human scoring and ma-
chine scoring can further improve the scoring per-
formance obtained by just using automated speech
scoring. By focusing human scoring, which is ex-
pensive, slow, but more accurate, on a set of re-
sponses specially selected from the entire set of re-
sponses, we can achieve larger gains of scoring per-
formance than randomly assigning the same amount
of responses for human scoring. Therefore, from an
engineering point of view of building more accurate
scoring systems, it is promising to design a hybrid
system consisting of both human scoring and ma-
chine scoring.
For future research, given the automated speech
scoring system?s large performance variation on two
types of responses, it is worthwhile finding a reli-
able way to automatically predict a responses? con-
dition, i.e., whether it is hard or easy to score for
humans or for machines. We need to consider both
proficiency features we used in this paper and other
features measuring audio quality. Finding such in-
formation can help us decide when to use machine
scoring and when to rely on human raters. In addi-
tion, other applications of human computation, such
as asking humans to adjust machine predicted scores
or using human rated scores accumulated in scoring
operations to routinely update the machine scoring
system will be explored.
