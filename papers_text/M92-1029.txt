INTRODUCTION AND APPROACH
Unlike most natural language processing (NLP) systems, TexUS (Text Understanding System) is being developed
as a domain-independent shell, to facilitate the application of language analysis to a variety of tasks and domains of
discourse . Our work not only develops robust and generic language analysis capabilities, but also elaborate s
knowledge representations, knowledge engineering methods, and convenient interfaces for knowledge acquisition .
TexUS builds on INLET (Interactive Natural Language Engineering Tool) [1][2], which was used for MUC3 . Both
descend from VOX (Vocabulary Extension System) [3] [4], which was developed from 1983-87 at UCI and 1988-90
at MDESC . Many analysis, knowledge representation, and knowledge acquisition ideas from VOX have evolved i n
constructing TexUS . In particular, TexUS (1) implements completely new, robust, and tailorable analysi s
algorithms ; (2) embeds analyzer data structures within the knowledge representation; (3) supports interactive
graphical knowledge engineering ; (4) runs in C on Sun workstations, to improve portability and speed; and (5 )
employs a pragmatic and domain-independent knowledge representation framework . TexUS and INLET differ
primarily in the strength of the analysis capability . Figure 1 exemplifies the graphical utilities available in TexUS .

The system we used at MUC3 was new (under development for 9 months) and incomplete . In essence, a
sophisticated skimming system carried the analysis burden . Since that time, we have implemented a comprehensive
analyzer that includes the following phases : (1) key pattern search, which locates potentially interesting texts an d
text fragments; (2) pre-processing, where idiomatic constructs are collapsed in bottom-up fashion ; (3) syntactic
analysis, which uses primarily top-down mechanisms to successively segment text into finer-grained units, i .e . ,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and components ; (4) semantic: analysis, which extracts and standardizes informatio n
found in the parse tree; (5) discourse analysis, which traverses the semantic representation to establish relationship s
between events, actors, objects, and other cases; and (6) back-end processing, which converts the interna l
representation produced by the analyzer to task-specific output . Table 1 highlights differences between the TexUS
and INLET systems .

Table 1 . TexUS builds on INLET analysis capabilities
The algorithms provided with TexUS support truly robust analysis . Construction of useful parse trees does no t
depend on complete syntactic characterization of the text, and succeeds even in the presence of ungrammatical ,
terse, and garbled text abounding in unknown words and phrases . This is accomplished by using grammar rules tha t
successively relax constraints . For example, one hierarchy of grammar rules is dedicated to segmenting clauses int o
components (e .g., noun and verb phrases). Rules that represent the strongest confidence (such as "det quan ad j
noun" with no optional pans) are applied first. If these fail, rules with optionality are applied next (e .g., with "det"
missing) . Next, rules containing wildcard elements (e .g ., a wildcard "noun" element) but allowing no optionality are
applied, followed by rules with wildcards and optionality . In this way, we attempt to match the text to rules wit h
highest confidence first (the ordering interleaves, e.g ., rules for noun phrases and verb phrases, to maximiz e
confidence). Using rules with wildcards and little optionality allows the analyzer to characterize fragments of text
containing unknown words with reasonable confidence in many cases. Such rules also support automated
knowledge acquisition (See section 2 .2).
The parsing mechanisms are driven by hierarchies of grammar rules . Much of our analyzer development thu s
consists of refining these rule sets, rather than building code . Further, we have developed generic analysi s
mechanisms that serve multiple tasks, depending on the rule sets they are given as parameters . Building analyzers
for new tasks is substantially reduced to selecting and using existing analysis mechanisms and creating rule set s
when needed for new domains . We are currently developing an interactive graphical analyzer tool to simplif y
enhancement of the analyzer algorithms .
In order to exercise the NLP shell approach taken in TexUS, we are developing analyzers for Army SALUT E
messages and texts provided by Federal Express . The most important validation of our approach was provided at
MUC3. With only 2 man-months of customization, we achieved performance comparable to sites that devoted
about one man-year of effort. Similarly, 3 .5 man-months of customization for MUC4 have brought us to the same
level as before, but with much greater potential for enhanced performance in the near term .

Analysis System
TexUS provides tailorable analysis capabilities . Rather than providing a monolithic analyzer that must be applied to
all tasks, we have provided a set of functions that can be mixed and matched to easily construct an analyzer for a
new task . Analysis functions perform tasks such as : (1) tokenize the input text, (2) perform morphological analysi s
and lexical lookup, (3) locate keywords and key phrases within a text, (4) apply rules to segment text, (5) appl y
rules to match segments of a text, and (6) perform semantic analysis on parse trees . Functions can apply top down
or bottom up, a single or multiple times per node of the parse tree, recursively or not, and so on . Functions typicall y
apply a hierarchy of grammar rules to the parse tree, so that augmenting the analyzer often consists of modifying or
adding grammar rules, rather than code. Modifying the analyzer code most often consists of adding calls to existin g
functions, rather than implementing new functions .

Figure 3. TexUS provides complete end-to-end analysis capabilities
The analysis algorithms are robust because they don't depend on complete characterization of the text in order t o
produce parse trees . When syntactic grammar rules apply, they are used in building the parse tree, but even whe n
the text is ill-formed or the syntax knowledge of the system is incomplete, the analyzer produces parse trees from
which useful information can be extracted .
Semantic analysis extracts and standardizes information by traversing the parse tree produced by the grammar-based
analyzer. We have implemented semantic analysis capabilities to locate events, actors, objects, instruments, time ,
and location within a text . We are currently developing deep analysis capabilities that intelligently resolve discours e
phenomena (e.g., whether two sentences describe the same or different events) . The semantic analyzer employ s
209
domain-specific rules whenever possible, and uses more generic knowledge when necessary, in order to extract
relevant information .
The semantic analyzer constructs an internal representation of the objects and relationships between them . The
discourse analyzer traverses the internal semantic representation to establish links between events, actors, objects,
locations, dates, instruments, and other information extracted from text. The internal representation then serves as
input to a task-specific conversion process that produces the desired output . We are investigating interactive tools to
specify the output format. Figure 3 depicts the analysis passes implemented in TexUS .
Knowledge Acquisition Capability
The knowledge acquisition system provides a set of iinteractive graphic tools, including a hierarchy-base d
knowledge editor, a grammar rule editor, a vocabulary addition tool, and a dictionary tool . These tools allow a user
to add lexical, syntactic, semantic, and domain knowledge to the system . The user can also build hierarchies that
drive the analysis functions described earlier .
We have implemented automated knowledge acquisition capabilities that apply during analysis. For example, the
analyzer applies patterns with one-word wildcards to categorize unknown words . A pattern such as "det quan WILD
noun", when it matches a piece of text such as "the two rebel positions", leads the analyzer to hypothesize tha t
"rebel" is an adjective or noun . Other mechanisms use morphological evidence and multi-word wildcards t o
characterize words and phrases . Expanding the automated knowledge acquisition capability is part of our ongoin g
research effort.
Batch knowledge acquisition tools have also been implemented, for example, to incorporate personal an d
geographic names into the knowledge base . We se investigating the use of on-line dictionaries to enlarge the
knowledge base. We are already em*'oying the Collin's English Dictionary (CED) provided by the ACL Dat a
Collection Initiative for syntax class L . .ormation, and are investigating the extraction of semantic information a s
well .
Knowledge Base
We have implemented a domain-independent knowledge management framework that improves the Conceptua l
Grammar framework of the predecessor VOX system . The knowledge base represents a variety of linguistic and
conceptual knowledge, as well as housing the analyzer data structures and internal meaning representation dat a
structures . Figure 4 exemplifies the knowledge representation for kidnapping concepts and their associated words .
Figure 4. Knowledge representation example -- kidnapping concepts and word s
210
The knowledge representation elements are concepts and grammar rules that are analogous to Lisp symbols an d
lists . Grammar rules represent any kind of sequential information ; we use them for syntax rules, idiomatic phrases ,
attributes of concepts, patterns with wildcards, logical expressions, and so on . Attributes specify relationships
between concepts, such as the parent-child relationship in a hierarchy .
The system's knowledge is stored in several forms . The raw database consists of knowledge in a form d irectly
accessed and updated by TexUS . A second form of the knowledge consists of a set of files containing primitive
knowledge addition commands (e .g ., a command to add a node to a phrase). Executing the commands in this fil e
system rebuilds the entire knowledge base from scratch . A third form of the knowledge consists of a file system of
high level knowledge addition commands (e .g., a command to add a noun to the system) . Each form of the
knowledge provides a greater degree of independence from the system internals, and each is successively more
human readable . The multiple layers of knowledge storage also provide extra knowledge protection, in case on e
layer is corrupted .
CURRENT WORK
Having completed an end-to-end analysis framework, our main tasks at present are to improve each pass of th e
analyzer and smooth the interactions between the passes . We are using the MUC development corpus to monito r
our progress in fleshing out the analyzer and enhancing its performance. By early 1993, we will have completed a
"beta release" of TexUS.
SYSTEM INFORMATIO N
TexUS has 89,000 lines of code and runs on Sun SPARCstations in C and Sunview . The system customized for
MUC4 has about 1800 vocabulary words (not counting conjugations), with an additional 4,000 Hispanic names an d
geographic locations. The analyzer uses about 260 rules and processes text at about 2 words per second .
MUC4 DISCUSSIO N
That our current system is in transition is clearly evidenced by comparing the MUC3 and MUC4 scores. In fact, the
rescored MUC3 results are better than those of the current system .
We have also implemented extensive automated testing facilities to augment the MUC scoring apparatus . We have
used the testing system in preparing for MUC4 and will make extensive use of it during the remainder of 1992 t o
improve performance on the MUC task.
Processing of Message 0048 in TST2
Relevancefilter: Keyword and key pattern search helps identify relevant portions of the text .
Lexical: The lexical pass is primarily concerned with identifying locations and names, and implements n-gram
methods to decide if unknown words are English or not . To augment the system's vocabulary, the lexical pass made
extensive use of the Collin's English Dictionary (CED) . The set list of locations is used by the lexical pass, as is a
set of personal names extracted from the development corpus . Spelling correction and morphological analysi s
algorithms also apply to unknown words .
For message 48, the lexical analyzer failed to find 'yet' in the CED, so n-gram analysis guessed that it is an English
word. The word 'there' was absent from our core vocabulary, indicating the incompleteness of our coverage. The
complete list of unknown words found in the CED for message 48 follows :
abroad, accused, appointed, approve, armored, christian, closely, confirmed, considered, cordoned ,
credit, declared, democrat, drastic, elect, escaped, halt, including, intended, intersection, job, laws,
legislative, linked, moments, napoleon, niece, noted, occasions, old, operation, possibility, prompt ,
reaction, replace, represent, responsible, roof, ruled, same, sources, stopped, street, termed, there ,
threatened, time, traveling, unscathed, warned
The spelling corrector converted "asssembly" to "assembly" . Finally, all the names in the message, such as
"Roberto Garcia Alvarado", were correctly determined.
211
Before and after lexical analysis, bottom-up passes through the message text located several types of idioms . Before
lexical analysis, the following were found
Specific locations :
Date phrases:
Transition advs :
Brackets:
Literals:
Verb idioms :
Complex preps :
"San Salvador"
"5 days ago"
"also "
"Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front"
"took place", "carrying out"
"according to"
After lexical analysis, the following were found :
Locations :
	
"downtown San Salvador "
Noun list
	
"government and military"
Erroneous findings were made by the noun-listing rule, which was recently added to the system:
"Roberto Garcia Alvarado and accused "
"police and Garcia"
Syntactic analysis : The syntactic segmentation algorithms have worked very well, considering the preliminary
state of our knowledge base and the large degree of syntactic ambiguity supplied by the CED. For example, the first
sentence in message 48 was segmented to the following components:
(np)
	
salvadoran president
(np)
	
- elec t
(np)
	
alfredo cristian i
(vp)
	
condemned
(np)
	
the terrorist
(np)
	
killing
(pp)
	
of attorney genera l
(np)
	
roberto garcia alvarado and accuse d
(np)
	
the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln )
(pp)
	
of the crime
(?)
In general, the assignment of np, vp, and pp was correct, even in this sentence . Lack of patterns such as
<alphabetic> <hyphen> <alphabetic> led to the mishandling of "president-elect" . "The terrorist killing" is difficul t
to assign correctly in general, and TexUS did well to assign the noun sense of "killing" . As described for the lexical
pass, "roberto garcia alvarado and accused" was misparsed because of a noun list pattern <noun> <and> <noun> tha t
was overly unrestricted.
Semantic analyis: The semantic structures produced for the first sentence in message 48 derive directly from the
syntactic segmentation shown above . We have edited the internal semantic representation to be human-readable:
event =condemned
actors = (1) Salvadoran president, (2) elect, (3) alfredo cristiani .
actions = (1) killing, (2) crime .
objects = (1) terrorist, (2) attorney general, (3) roberto garcia alvarado
and accused, (4) fmln
The assignments are generally reasonable, except that merging of appositives and split noun phrases is not ye t
implemented. In the two weeks following the formal MUC4 test, we have improved the semantic analyzer to outpu t
separate event structures for nominal actions such as "the terrorist killing" and "the crime", so that adverbia l
information can be properly attached to these events .
After fixing some of the segmentation bugs noted earlier, the semantic output is greatly improved :
212
event = condemned
actor = (1) salvadoran, (2) president-elect alfredo cristiani .
object = the terrorist
event-object = killing
event = killing
object = attorney general
event = accused
object = fmln
event-object = crime
event = crime
actor = fmln
Discourse analysis: Discourse analysis links or separates semantic information based on syntactic, semantic, an d
discourse knowledge . In general, semantic information is separated or merged by comparing date/time, location,
actors and objects . Actors and objects are classified as proper nouns, pronouns, or abstract nouns (e .g., "the home")
and are compared by successively relaxing constraints on agreement, as in the syntactic and semantic passes . If the
object being compared is the name "Garcia", then the fi rst precedence for comparison will be other names such as
"Roberto Garcia Alvarado" or "Garcia Alvarado" which contain the name "Garcia" . If none are found, a proper
name is then matched with pronouns such as "he" or "him" . If that also fails, then "Garcia" is matched with abstrac t
nouns such as " the attorney general" . Time, location, and other concepts are compared similarly .
One construction not currently handled by the discourse analyzer is the phrase "Merino's home " . The discourse
analyzer does not yet link possessive nouns with other nouns in the corpus, which would help classify "Merino's
home " as a GOVERNMENT OFFICE OR RESIDENCE instead of CIVILIAN RESIDENCE .
For meaningful work on message 48, discourse analysis depended on modifications to the earlier passes . In
addition, we added a pragmatic rule that merged events based on location, allowing the attack on Merino's home to
be merged with the fact that children were in the home at the time (sentences 11-13 of message 48) . In general, the
discourse process works well on MUC messages when the prior passes produce a correct internal semanti c
representation .

CONCLUSION
TexUS, substantially expands the capabilities of the system fielded at MUC3 . The MUC4 scores of TexUS do not
yet reflect the system's potential, a situation which we will rectify by the end of 1992. The 3.5 man-months of
customization for MUC4 did not improve the overall performance over last year, because more passes of th e
analyzer must be upgraded for each new capability introduced into the system . Furthermore, of the total effort, at
least half was devoted to corpus study rather than augmenting the analyzer and knowledge base.
Unlike MUC3, where our system had reached its full potential, TexUS is now a complete end-to-end framework
which will serve to develop much stronger performance than we have shown at both MUC3 and MUC4. We look
forward to exhibiting the system to good effect at the next MUC conference .
