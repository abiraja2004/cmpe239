Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for expressing 
concepts, a set from which writers choose the particular form that they feel will produce the most 
effective xpression given the communicative context. An important ask of the text generation 
researcher is to specify both the range of these forms and the contexts in which they are used. This 
paper addresses this issue in the context of the expression of procedural relations between actions 
in instructional text. It employs the following four-step approach to achieve this goal: (1) collect a 
corpus of the relevant text type; (2) perform adetailed linguistic study of a portion of this corpus, 
called the training set, and reserve the remainder as a testing set; (3) implement the results of 
this study in a text generation system; and (4) compare the output of the system with the text 
found in the entire corpus. This has resulted in the construction of IMAGENE, an instructional 
text generation system that embodies a model of the forms of expression consistently used by 
instructional text writers over a broad range of instruction types. The details of IMAGENE'S 
treatment of purpose xpressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full 
system. 
1. Introduction 
Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for ex- 
pressing concepts, many of which may, taken out of context, appear to be interchange- 
able. They are not interchangeable. Writers systematically choose the particular form 
from this set that they feel will produce the most effective xpression given the com- 
municative context. An important ask of the text generation researcher is to inform 
the text generation process with a specification of both the range of these forms and 
the contexts in which they are used. 
The current study addresses this issue in the context of expressing procedural 
relations between actions in instructional text, that is, in written, procedural directions. 
The complexity of procedural relations typically expressed in such text has given rise 
to complex variations of expression in language. Consider, for example, the problem 
of expressing purpose relations. Such expressions could take many conceivable forms, 
all of which are perfectly grammatical: 
(la) Pull out sharply in order to remove the phone. 
(lb) To remove phone, pull out sharply.

(lc) Pull out sharply for phone removal. 
(ld) Pull out sharply for removing the phone. 
(le) For the phone, pull out sharply. 
(lf) Remove phone by pulling out sharply. 
(lg) Remove the phone. Pull out sharply. 
(lh) The purpose of pulling out sharply is to remove the phone. 
(li) Pulling out sharply achieves the purpose of removing the phone. 
(l j) Removing the phone involves pulling out sharply. 
(lk) The method for removing the phone is to pull out sharply. 
As can be seen, purpose expressions occur either before or after the expression of 
their related sub-actions (referred to here as the issue of slot) and are expressed in a 
number of grammatical forms (the issue of form). They may be linked with a variety of 
conjunctions or prepositions (the issue of linker) and may or may not be combined into 
a single sentence with the expression of their sub-actions (the issue of clause combining). 
The current study addresses these four issues of choice in the context of instructional 
text. 
Text generation systems must know which forms to produce and when to produce 
them. Formal linguistic analyses are useful for weeding out grammatically unaccept- 
able forms, but they do not provide a principled means of determining which of the 
grammatically acceptable forms should be used in any given communicative context. 
As an alternative, the current study has employed the following four-step rocess for 
identifying both the relevant forms of expression and the contexts in which they are 
used: 
. 
. 
. 
4. 
Collect a corpus of text from the relevant genre and encode a full range 
of the lexical and grammatical features of all of the text. 
Perform a linguistic analysis of part of the corpus. This analysis involves 
determining the range of forms used in the corpus and then using an 
iterative cycle of hypothesis formation and testing to determine the 
communicative contexts in which each is used. 
Implement the results of this analysis in the text generation system. 
Compare, in detail, the output of the system with the text found in the 
corpus, differentiating between the predictions concerning text that was 
specifically used in the analysis (the training set) and text that was not 
(the testing set). 
This process begins and ends with the corpus, providing an empirically based 
approach to identifying the range of lexical and grammatical forms that are used in 
real text and to determining the contextual issues that are relevant o choosing among 
them. Although the corpus study has become a common methodology in natural 
language generation, seldom are the representation a d analysis techniques given in 
any detail, and detailed evaluations of the resulting text are not provided. These details 
are provided, for our study, in this paper. 
Our corpus is divided into training and testing portions. The training portion, used 
in step 2, constitutes approximately one-third of the full corpus and consists entirely of 
30

cordless telephone manuals. The methodology is successfully applied to this portion, 
showing that there are, in fact, patterns of expression i  cordless telephone manuals 
that can be identified and implemented. The study is then extended by testing the 
system's predictions on a separate and more diverse portion of the corpus that includes 
instructions for different types of devices and processes. This additional testing serves 
both to disallow over-fitting of the data in the training portion and to give a measure 
of how far beyond the telephone domain the predictions can legitimately be applied. 
No testing was done on noninstructional texts, and no claims are made concerning 
the applicability of the system's predictions in those areas. 
Following a review of relevant work in the area of natural anguage generation, 
this paper will discuss how these four steps have been applied to the generation 
of rhetorical relations in instructional text. It will detail what rhetorical relations in 
instructional text are and how they were collected and represented. It will then discuss 
how the corpus analysis was performed and how the results were implemented in
IMAGENE, an instructional text generation system. The details of IMAGENE'S treatment 
of purpose xpressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full 
system (more details concerning the other relations can be found elsewhere \[Vander 
Linden 1993c\]). It will conclude with a discussion of how well IMAGENE'S predictions 
match the text in the training and the testing portions of the corpus. 
2. Related Work in Natural Language Generation 
In pursuit of other issues, many studies have adopted a temporary solution to the 
problem of managing diverse forms of expression, amely, that of choosing a single 
lexical and grammatical form to express each of the relevant types of information dealt 
with by the system. It is then a simple matter of allowing the type of information to 
determine the appropriate xpressional form. Hovy's text structurer (Hovy 1988b), 
for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) 
(Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed. It does not 
make any decision as to how a chosen relation is to be expressed, but rather leaves 
this task to the rudimentary implementation f the rhetorical relations provided by the 
Penman text generation system (Mann 1985). In the case of a purpose, for example, 
Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following 
output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p. 167): "Knox is en route in order to rendezvous 
with CTG 070.10." A similar approach to expressing rhetorical relations was taken in 
McKeown's TEXT system (McKeown 1985). 
Text generators specifically designed for instructional text, such as Mellish and 
Evans' generator (Mellish and Evans 1989), EPICURE (Dale 1992), COMET (McKeown 
et al 1990), and TECHDOC (R6sner and Stede 1992b), display similar characteristics. 
(See the analytical work of Delin, Scott, and Hartley \[1993\] for a notable xception to 
this pattern.) 
Mellish and Evans' generator, for example, uses the output of NONLIN, a non- 
linear planner (Tate 1976), as the preliminary rhetorical structure for the text. Because 
this often produced text that was monotonous or hard to understand, they included 
what was termed a message optimization phase that specifies rules for removing or 
modifying certain elements of the plan structure that are known to produce poor text. 
Although this greatly improves the text, it still tends toward text that is difficult to 
read. This problem is, in part, due to the fact that some of the plans they look at are 
quite complex and correspondingly difficult to express, but it is also attributable to 
the lack of a detailed corpus study of the linguistic tools used by technical writers 
in instructional text. The IMAGENE project can be seen as an extension of their work 
31 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 
that employs uch a study to help manage diversity of forms of expression. There are 
other natural language generation projects that have addressed similar issues. Two 
such examples are Hovy's Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer's Spokesman (Meteer 
1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies. 
Pauline produces an impressive range of expressional forms that are based on a 
list of pragmatic features of the communicative environment, including information 
about the conversational tmosphere, the speaker, the hearer, the relationship between 
the two, and the interpersonal communicative goals of the speaker. Its construction 
required a considerable amount of analysis of sample texts, but unfortunately, very 
little is said about how this analysis was actually performed and how well the text 
produced by Pauline matches the text in the corpus. The concerns of the IMAGENE 
project are similar, except hat both the text type (instructional text) and the linguistic 
phenomenon (expressing rhetorical relations) are much more focused. The results of 
our study are therefore more detailed, but also more constrained (see the concept 
of domain communication knowledge, as described by Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow 
\[1991\]). 
In the Spokesman project, Meteer proposed an architecture for addressing what she 
termed the problem of expressibility in text planning (Meteer 1992). Her fundamental 
thesis is that an abstract linguistic representation is needed to provide the text planner 
with information on constraints of expression (see Vaughan, and McDonald 1987). 
Her constraints are taken, at least in part, from a study of text revisions made by 
expert editors. The IMAGENE project concurs with this concern for detailed forms of 
expression, but its methodology is geared toward determining the elements of the 
communicative context used to choose between equally acceptable alternative forms 
of expression. Meteer does not address what to do if, after using her constraints to 
remove unacceptable forms of expression, there are a number of remaining acceptable 
forms. This issue of choice is central to the current study. 
3. Corpus Collection and Representation 
The corpus developed for this study was taken from various types of instructional 
text, including instruction booklets, recipes, and auto-repair manuals. It contains ap- 
proximately 1000 clauses (6000 words) of instructions, taken from 17 different sources 
representing a diverse array of process types. These sources include instructions for 
electronic devices like cordless telephones and clock radios, manipulative processes 
like auto repair and first aid, and creative processes like cooking and craft making. 
The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the 
procedural relations between them. 1 As an example of the nature of this text, consider 
the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone (Airfone 1991), which 
will be called the Remove-Phone t xt: 
(2) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top 
of handset and pulling out. Return to seat to place calls. (Airfone 1991) 2 
1 It should be noted that this corpus is much smaller than the language corpora used in larger statistical 
studies (Church and Mercer 1993). The deep semantic and pragmatic knowledge that was required for 
the current study has necessitated this. 
2 This paper will add a reference to the end of all examples that have come directly from the corpus, 
indicating the manual from which they were taken. Examples of actual IMAGENE output will be fully 
italicized. All other examples are contrived for explanatory purposes.

This passage gives an example of the variation of expressional form that is common 
in instructional text. It contains, among other things, two expressions of purpose: 
"remove phone" and "to place calls." This notion of purpose, which will be detailed 
in the next section, is one of actions that are to be realized through the execution of 
expressed sub-actions. The first is stated as an imperative ("remove the phone"), with 
the sub-actions expressed in participial form within a by prepositional phrase ("by 
firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out"). The second ("to place calls"), on the 
other hand, is expressed in final position as a to infinitive, with its sub-action stated as 
an imperative ("return to seat"). The problem to be addressed by the corpus analysis 
in step 2 is to determine the contextual features used to choose these forms as opposed 
to the alternate forms that could have expressed the "same basic information." 
A relational-style database is used to represent the rhetorical, grammatical, and 
lexical aspects of the corpus. The representation f the grammatical form of the clauses 
and phrases is based on traditional principles of syntax and semantics. Clauses and 
phrases are represented in separate tables. Links within the clause table are used to 
indicate subordinate relations, and links between the clause and phrase tables are 
used to represent relative clauses and predicate-argument relations. It also includes 
semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the 
device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process). 
More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c). The goal 
was to allow for the representation f any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or 
syntactic ontext hat might be relevant in the analysis. 
Mann and Thompson's RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations be- 
tween expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988). It was developed 
as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and 
pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels. The current study has 
made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concur- 
rent. This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present 
an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone t xt, and conclude with definitions of 
the relations used in the study. 
RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus-satellite and multi-nuclear sche- 
mata. The nucleus-satellite schema relates two spans of text: one designating a more 
central span, called the nucleus, and a more peripheral one, called the satellite. This re- 
lation is represented graphically with a directed arrow from the satellite to the nucleus. 
Definitions of relations of this sort specify constraints hat apply to the nucleus (N), the 
satellite (S), and the combination of the two and specify the effects of the expression. 
Purpose, Precondition, and Result are examples of such relations. The multi-nuclear 
schema relates one or more spans, designating no span as superordinate or subor- 
dinate to any other. Definitions of relations of this sort include specification of the 
constraints on the nuclei and the combination of nuclei, as well as a specification of 
the effect of the expression. The Sequence and Concurrent relations are such relations. 
RST was attractive for the IMAGENE project because of its ability to represent the hi- 
erarchical structure of text with rhetorical structures that matched the level of analysis 
required for the study of expressions ofprocedural relations. There is considerable de- 
bate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional 
structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), 
most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as 
the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure 
common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b). 
Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation 
(e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; R6sner

and Stede 1992a). This testifies not only to RST's usefulness, but also to the direct 
applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural anguage gen- 
eration. Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to 
other work in this area. In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of 
rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the 
work of Scott and Souza \[1990\] on expressing rhetorical relations). 
Consider the application of RST to the Remove-Phone t xt. The first problem that 
must be addressed in any RST analysis is the segmentation f the text into spans 
that will serve as the atomic units of description. In RST, these spans have typically 
been clauses, as is the case in the Remove-Phone passage, but certain phrases with 
propositional content may be considered as well. The spans used in our analysis are 
propositional units that express ingle actions. In the Remove-Phone t xt, there are six 
such action expressions, listed here in segmented form: 
. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) 
remove phone 
by firmly grasping top of handset 
and pulling out. 
Return to seat 
to place calls. 
The second problem is one of relating these segments in the appropriate rhetorical 
structure. The current study has used the two aspects of the RST specification that 
can be mapped onto the procedural structure of the process being expressed, namely, 
the hierarchical structure of RST and the subset of RST relations that correspond to 
procedural relations. Each of these two aspects will be discussed with reference to the 
RST representation for the Remove-Phone t xt, shown in Figure 1. 3 
The first aspect of this structure is its hierarchical nature. The procedural sequence 
schema at the top of the text hierarchy, for example, indicates that there are two 
3 The actual RST and grammatical nalyses of the text were performed by one of the authors, and the 
examples crucial to the formalization of the results were reviewed by both authors. This approach 
would be difficult in the analysis of certain more complex texts such as persuasive t xts, but proved to 
be adequate in the study of local structure in instructional text. 
34 
Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations 
spans of text that express a sequence of two actions. The spans themselves can be 
expressed as single propositional units or as more complex spans, the latter being the 
case with the two spans in this sequence. This is a representational manifestation f 
the hierarchical nature of the processes themselves and is displayed graphically by 
extending the horizontal line of a span to cover all of its subordinate spans. The RST 
representation f the Remove-Phone t xt is a small portion of the full hierarchy that 
represents he entire manual. The current study has focused on the expression of just 
such local sub-trees; the problems of expression of macro-structure are beyond the 
scope of the analysis (see Mooney, Carberry, and McCoy 1991). 
The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations them- 
selves. The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, 
Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and 
grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process. They 
are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and 
Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic ontent rather than on inten- 
tional or presentational content. 4 This section will now provide specific definitions of 
these relations. 
PURPOSE (taken from Mann and Thompson 1987) 
constraints on N: presents an activity 
constraints on S: presents a situation that is unrealized 
constraints on the N+S combination: 
S presents a situation to be realized through the activity in N 
the effect: R recognizes that the activity in N is initiated in order to 
realize S 
The Purpose relation is taken directly from the RST specification. In this paper, it 
refers to a situation in which a higher level activity is realized through the execution 
of lower level sub-steps. An example can be found in the Remove-Phone t xt cited 
above: "...  remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out." Here the 
activity of removing the phone is realized by the execution of the sub-steps of grasping 
and pulling the phone. 
PRECONDITION (taken from R6sner and Stede 1992a) 
constraints on N: presents an action 
constraints on S: presents an unrealized situation 
constraints on the N+S combination: 
S must be realized in order to make it possible or sensible 
to carry out N 
the effect: R recognizes that situation S must be realized in order to 
successfully carry out action N 
The Precondition relation is a simple amalgam of the standard RST relations Cir- 
cumstance and Condition. It has been taken from R6sner and Stede's work on gener- 
ating multilingual instructions (R6sner and Stede 1992a). This particular combination 
has proven useful in analyzing various kinds of conditions and circumstances that 
4 There is some question as to whether these semantically based relations hould be termed rhetorical in 
the classic sense at all (Dale 1993). Because of the prevalence of this use of the term, however, it will be 
retained in this paper.

frequently arise in instructions, uch as the precondition found in the Remove-Phone 
text: "When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone .. . .  " Here, the removal of the 
phone must not be attempted until after the device has instructed the user to do so.

presents either a volitional or non-volitional ction or 
the situation that could have arisen from one 
combination: 
N presents a situation that could have caused the situation 
presented in S; presentation of N is more central to W's 
purposes in putting forth the N-S combination than is 
the presentation of S. 
R recognizes that the situation presented in N could be a 
cause for the action or situation presented in S 
The Result relation is a simple amalgam of RST's volitional and non-volitional re- 
sults. It was useful for analyzing expressions ofactions or situations that are expressed 
as being the result of other actions, as in "Place the handset in the base. The BATTERY 
CHARGE INDICATOR will light." (Excursion 1989). Here, the device's action of lighting 
the indicator is a result of the reader's action of placing the handset in the base. 
SEQUENCE (taken from Mann and Thompson 1987) 
constraints on N: multi-nuclear 
constraints on the combinat ion of nuclei: 
A succession relationship between the situations is 
presented in the nuclei 
the effect: R recognizes the succession relations among the nuclei 
The Sequence relation is taken directly from the RST specification and refers to 
actions that are in temporal sequence, as in the following excerpt from the Remove- 
Phone text: ".. .  by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out." 
CONCURRENT (adapted from Mann and Thompson 1987) 
constraints on N: multi-nuclear 
constraints on the combinat ion of nuclei: 
A simultaneous relation between distinct situations is 
presented in the nuclei 
the effect: R recognizes the simultaneous relations among the 
nuclei 
Finally, the Concurrent relation is a simple extension of Sequence, referring to 
actions that are distinct but simultaneous. An example can be found in "Press and 
hold the mouse button while you move the mouse." (Macintosh 1988). Here, holding 
the mouse button and moving the mouse must be done simultaneously.

4. Corpus Analysis 
Two related issues must be addressed in the corpus analysis: 
. 
. 
Determining the range of expressional forms commonly used by 
instructional text writers. 
Determining the precise communicative context in which each of these 
forms is used. 
With a couple of minor exceptions, the study was performed exclusively on three 
instruction manuals for cordless telephones (approximately one-third of our corpus), 
and the results were applied to the remainder of the corpus. The exceptions involved 
so that and until expressions and expressions of concurrency, which were not well 
represented in the telephone manuals. Examples of these expressions were taken from 
the remainder of the corpus. The method employed therefore has much in common 
with the method proposed by Quinlan and implemented in ID3 (Quinlan 1986) in that 
the training set is expanded in cases where there are insufficient examples on which to 
base a full analysis. So far, the testing set has not been expanded to include examples 
on which to test these so that, until, and concurrent expressions. 
4.1 The Range of Expressions 
The first task is that of determining the range of lexical and grammatical forms used 
to express each particular hetorical relation. The full corpus contains 119 purpose 
expressions, all but four of which occur in one of the following seven forms (the 
purpose, i.e., the satellite span of the rhetorical relation, is italicized): 
(3a) To end a previous call, hold down FLASH \[6\] for about two seconds, then 
release it. (Code-a-phone 1989) 
(3b) Follow the steps in the illustration below, for desk installation. 
(Code-a-phone 1989) 
(3c) The OFF position is primarily used for charging the batteries. 
(Code-a-phone 1989) 
(3d) For frequently busy numbers, you'll want to use REDIAL \[7\], and the 
pause will have to be in Redial memory. (Code-a-phone 1989) 
(3e) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of 
handset and pulling out. (Airfone 1991) 
(3f) Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken. Insert heel first as 
shown, then push top in firmly. (Airfone 1991) 
(3g) Tilt pan down slightly at the rear so that the fluid drains out. (Reader's 
Digest 1981) 
All four of the issues of lexical and grammatical choice we addressed are displayed 
here. The purpose expressions can be textually placed in the slot either before or af- 
ter the expression of their sub-actions. Furthermore, there are seven combinations of
grammatical form, linker, and clause combining to choose from, the relative frequen- 
cies and percentages of which are given in Table 1 (where the letters in example (3) 
correspond to the letters in the table). Example (3a) uses a to infinitive form (TNF).

(f) Adjoined-Purpose 4 0 4 3.3% 
(g) So-That-Purpose 0 10 10 8.4% 
Other 4 4 3.3% 
Example (3b) uses a for prepositional phrase with a nominalization ("installation") 
as the complement. Example (3d) uses a for preposition with a gerund phrase as the 
complement. Example (3c) uses a for preposition with a noun phrase that refers to the 
object (or goal) of the corresponding action as the complement. This is termed Goal 
Metonymy. Example (3e) uses a simple imperative for the purpose with by conjoining 
participial forms of the intended actions. Example (3f) uses a simple imperative for the 
purpose, with the intended actions in a separate sentence following the purpose. Ex- 
ample (3g) uses a simple imperative for the intended actions, with a so that conjoining 
a present ense action form of the purpose. 5 
4.2 The Context of Expression 
The second task, that of determining the functional context in which each of the forms 
is used is more difficult. The IMAGENE project employs a hypothesis generation and 
test cycle, such as the one advocated by Cumming (1990) in an attempt o identify 
correlations between the contextual features of communicative context on the one 
hand, and the lexical and grammatical forms on the other. 
This methodology starts with the range of lexical and grammatical forms corre- 
sponding to each of the rhetorical relations considered. In the hypothesis phase, the 
analyst hypothesizes a feature of the communicative context hat appears to correlate 
with the variation of some aspect of the lexical and grammatical forms. These hy- 
potheses may come from an intuitive analysis of the texts, as well as from the current 
literature on the subject. The features themselves pertain to any of three aspects of the 
communicative context (termed metafunctions in systemic linguistics): Ideational--the 
propositional meaning of the material being expressed (associated with the traditional 
notion of semantics); Textual--the flow and structure of the text (associated with dis- 
course analysis); and Interpersonal--the uman relationships between interlocutors 
(associated with socio-linguistics) (Halliday 1985). All of these types of features have 
proven relevant in the analysis. In the test phase, the analyst attempts to validate the 
hypothesis by querying the database for the relevant information. These two phases 
are repeated until a good match is achieved or until a relevant hypothesis cannot be 
found. 
As an example of this methodology, consider the issue of slot, that is, the deter- 
mination of which span in a rhetorical relation should be expressed first. The slot of 
5 This study has temporarily characterized these so that expressions a action/sub-action expressions. A 
more detailed analysis of how the situations that give rise to them differ from those for other purposes 
is yet to be performed.

purpose xpressions in our corpus is split fairly evenly between initial and final pur- 
pose expressions. Of the 119 purpose xpressions, approximately 48% are fronted and 
52% are not fronted. These values are similar to the percentages of initial and final 
purpose clauses found by Thompson (1985) for procedural texts. Although she reports 
just over 18% initial purpose clauses for English text in general, she reports 49% initial 
purpose clauses for a book of recipes and 34% for an auto-repair manual. 
Thompson's study indicated that one common feature of fronted purpose clauses 
is that their scope is global, that is, there is more than one expressed proposition that 
is directly related to the fulfillment of the purpose (e.g., "To achieve purpose A, do 
B and do C." where there are two sub-actions, B and C). Such a purpose clause is 
expressing a context in which the prescribed sub-actions are to be interpreted and 
thus should be fronted. This provides a good starting hypothesis for determining the 
slot of purposes, namely, that global purpose clauses are fronted. Upon inspection, 
we find that only three cases of global purpose xpressions in our corpus (7.9%) are 
not fronted. This yields strong support for the hypothesis and allows us to go on and 
discern what factors motivated the counter-examples. This process continues either 
until no distinctions can be found, or until there are not enough examples on which 
to base the distinctions. 
The next question to be asked is whether this is the only explanation of fronted 
purpose xpressions, or whether there are other fronted purpose xpressions that are 
not global. This can be addressed by querying all the fronted, non-global purpose 
clauses in the corpus. In the current corpus, this set is non-empty, which leads to the 
conclusion that there are other factors at work in the question of purpose slot. The 
iterative process of hypothesis generation and testing can then be conducted on these 
other cases in a similar manner. 
This analysis technique is designed to identify covariation between elements of 
the communicative context on the one hand and grammatical form on the other. The 
purpose slot analysis just discussed, for example, identifies the existence of a covari- 
ation between purpose scope and slot. This covariation, however, does not constitute 
proof that the technical writer actually considers the issue of slot during the gener- 
ation process, nor that the prescribed form is actually more effective than any other. 
Proof of either of these issues would require psycholinguistic esting. This study pro- 
vides detailed prescriptions concerning how such testing should be performed, i.e., 
what forms should be tested and what contexts controlled for, but it does not actually 
perform the tests. A discussion of this may be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993a). 
5. IMAGENE 
This section will discuss the theoretical framework of the implementation a d then 
detail the treatment for purpose xpressions. The full IMAGENE architecture, asdepicted 
in Figure 2, consists of a System Network and a Sentence Building routine and is built 
on top of Penman. It transforms inputs (shown on the left in Figure 2) into instructional 
text (shown on the right). 
5.1 IMAGENE's Architecture 
Penman, a sentence-level generator developed at the USC Information Sciences In- 
stitute (Mann 1985; Penman 1989), was employed not only because of its broad cov- 
erage of English syntax, but also because it is based on a Systemic-Functional view 
of language (Halliday 1976). The Systemic view is distinctly functional, that is, it is 
particularly interested in mapping elements of the communicative context onto the 
appropriate grammatical forms. As a by-product of this view of language, Penman

contains a well-developed implementation f the System Network, the Systemic formal- 
ism for representing grammar. 
The system network is basically a decision network in which each choice point 
distinguishes between alternative features of the communicative context. It has been 
used extensively in Systemic Linguistics to address both sentence-level and text-level 
issues (e.g., Berry 1981; Patten 1988; Fawcett 1990). Such networks are traversed based 
on the appropriate f atures of the communicative context, and as a side effect of this 
traversal, inguistic structures are constructed by realization statements hat are associ- 
ated with each feature of the network. Penman's networks are specifically designed 
to construct English sentences. 
IMAGENE's system network is built in a similar manner, but because it constructs 
text structures rather than sentences, its realization statements have a flavor signifi- 
cantly different from their counterparts in the grammar developed for Penman. 6 We 
now give a short discussion of how IMAGENE'S realization statements can manipulate 
the evolving text structure, making reference to the text structure produced by IMA- 
GENE for the portion of the Remove-Phone t xt shown in Figure 3 (which corresponds 
to the text span "... remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling 
out"). The full analysis of the Remove-Phone t xt will be given later; here we intend 
to illustrate only the types of manipulations made by the realization statements. 
? Inserting nodes into the text structure (iterative-insert, insert, 
copy)--IMAGENE starts with an empty text structure and uses these 
statements o insert action nodes as appropriate. In Figure 3, for 
example, the Remove-Action, Grasp-Action, and Pull-Action nodes refer 
to the actions of removing, grasping, and pulling the handset. 
? Ordering the surface xpression of the nodes (order, reorder, 
insert-order, combine)--IMAGENE uses these statements o specify the 
6 Penman's sentence-level r alization statements work with a single, prespecified list of features of the 
sentence, called grammatical functions, such as ACTOR, PROCESS, GOAL, and THEME. At the 
text-level, there is no definitive list of what might be called text functions. Rather, IMAGENE'S realization 
statements allow the insertion of subscripted elements that can correspond to lists of sequential 
commands, multiple preconditions, etc.

order of expression of the action nodes. The choice of clause-combining 
strategies i made here as well. In Figure 3, the links are shown as 
lightfaced irected arrows, marked with either New-Sentence or 
Continue-Sentence (in this segment, only the latter is used). Reorder is 
used to change an ordering made earlier in the processing, whereas the 
others establish the order of newly inserted nodes. 
Building the RST structure between odes (structure, unlink)--IMAGENE 
uses structure to create hierarchical text structure links between odes 
and unlink to remove them. Figure 3 contains a purpose relation and a 
sequential relation. As with reorder, unlink is used to "un-structure" a 
default structuring. 
Marking the lexical and grammatical forms of expression of the nodes 
(mark, iterative-mark)--The realization statements also determine the 
grammatical form of the expression of each of the nodes in the structure. 
In Figure 3, the Remove-Phone node, for example, is marked as an 
imperative, and the Grasp-Action as an ing form with the linker by. 
IMAGENE'S network consists of approximately 70systems. It maps those features of 
the communicative context deemed relevant in the corpus analysis performed in step 2 
onto the appropriate l xical and grammatical forms for expressing each action. The 
network, having the basic high-level structure shown in Figure 4, performs the two 
basic functions of Content and Rhetorical Status Selection and Grammatical Form Selection. 
We view Content Selection as the process of choosing the appropriate actions from 
the process plan to express and Rhetorical Status Selection as the process of choosing 
the appropriate rhetorical relation to be used in expressing each of these actions. IMA- 
GENE contains a sub-network implementing these two processes that is currently very 
preliminary (Vander Linden 1993c). 7This paper focuses on the Grammatical Form Se- 
lection portion of the network, that is, the choice, given an action to be expressed and 
its rhetorical status, of the appropriate l xical and grammatical forms of expression. 
We will present a detailed discussion of the purpose sub-network below, which is 
representative of the other grammatical form sub-networks. 
7 Paris (1988, 1993) discusses this issue in more detail, particularly asit pertains to user modeling.

A high-level view of the systems in the network. 
The input to IMAGENE is the set of features of the functional context hat affect the 
form of expression of the plan, called the text-level inquiries in Figure 2. This input is im- 
plemented as a set of responses to the inquiries made by the IMAGENE system network 
pursuant o determining the appropriate path to be taken through the IMAGENE system 
network. They are analogous to Penman's entence-level inquiries. Currently, the data 
structures and code necessary to respond to the inquiries automatically have not been 
implemented. Rather, the inquiries are answered manually, allowing us to focus on 
determining the appropriate set of inquiries and the precise lexical and grammatical 
consequences of the responses of these inquiries. The dashed lines in Figure 2 indicate 
some of the information sources that the inquiry implementations will access (i.e., the 
Process Structure, the Penman lexicon and grammar, and the evolving text structure). 
As a side effect of traversing the network, IMAGENE'S realization statements automati- 
cally realize these consequences in a text structure (also shown in Figure 2). The Text 
Structure, to be discussed more fully in Section 5.3, is represented in IMAGENE'S Text 
Representation Language (TRL). TRL itself is implemented in LOOM (MacGregor and 
Bates 1987; Loom 1993). 
A second input shown in Figure 2, the Process Structure, is a representation of
the process to be expressed. It is built in IMAGENE'S Process Representation Language 
(PRL), which is also implemented in LOOM and will also be discussed in Section 5.3. 
It is a representation like that produced by a procedural planner, containing the pro- 
cedural hierarchy of the process being expressed as well as some information about 
the lexical items used to express each action and its arguments. It is currently built by 
hand, which allows us to focus on the problem of expression rather than on planning. 
As previously mentioned, the Process Structure will eventually become a funda- 
mental source of procedural information for the text inquiries. Currently, however, it 
is simply used by the final component of the architecture, the Sentence Builder, to 
specify the appropriate lexical items and case structures for the action input to the 
text-level inquiries. The Sentence Builder uses the lexical information given in the 
Process Structure just described, to translate the Text Structure, described above, into 
the appropriate sentence specification to be passed to Penman for surface realization. 
This specification is coded in terms of Penman's Sentence Planning Language (SPL) 
(Kasper 1989), a language that allows the specification of the lexical items and gram- 
42 
Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations 
matical structures to be generated by Penman. The translation process is performed 
by a recursive descent of the Text Structure hierarchy. One SPL command is produced 
for each sentence in the Text Structure. 
5.2 Purpose Relations in Instructional Text 
Purpose expressions arise in the context in which actions are viewed as being related 
hierarchically, that is, in which one higher level action is realized by the execution of 
a set of lower level actions. 8 As Section 4 indicated, there are a large number of lexical 
and grammatical forms in which such procedural relations are typically expressed, 
each used in a particular functional context. This section discusses the systems that 
have been included in IMAGENE to distinguish among these contexts. 
There are other studies of purpose expressions from the point of view of repre- 
sentation and understanding that are of use here (Di Eugenio 1992; Balkanski 1992). 
Di Eugenio, for example, has worked with by purposes and to infinitive (TNF) pur- 
poses in the context of understanding, but does not appear to have distinguished the 
two forms in her analysis of the procedural relations between actions. The current 
study is critically interested in discerning principled reasons for choosing between 
these sorts of expressions. 
The issues of slot and form of purpose expressions are treated largely indepen- 
dently by IMAGENE. The slot is determined by the sub-network shown in Figure 5. The 
form is determined by the sub-networks shown later in Figures 7 and 8. This portion 
of the system network is capable of generating a greater range of purpose xpressions 
than is typical in generation systems and of identifying the functional reasons for 
choosing one form over the other. It should be noted that while the determinations 
made by the systems are based solely on the results of the corpus analysis conducted 
in step 2, the following sections will include intuitive motivations for the realizations 
the systems make. 
5.2.1 Purpose Slot. The slot determination portion of the purpose sub-network, shown 
in Figure 5, formalizes Thompson's notion of the "vastly different functions" for initial 
and final purpose clauses (Thompson 1985) in the context of instructional text. It 
typically places the purpose expression in the final position. The exceptions to this 
are when the scope of the purpose is global, the purpose is considered optional, or 
the purpose is considered contrastive. These three exceptions are handled by the three 
systems depicted in Figure 5. 9 
The first exception, handled by the Scope system, concerns the number of ac- 
tions pertained to by the purpose. This correspondence b tween global purposes and 
fronted purpose xpressions was already discussed in the corpus analysis ection, but 
to give an intuitive feel for this empirical result, consider the awkwardness of restating 
example (3a) as "?? Hold down FLASH \[6\] for about wo seconds, then release it to end 
a previous call. "1? The restatement seems to imply, incorrectly, that the purpose applies 
8 Goldman has termed these hierarchical relations generation relations (Goldman 1970). A detailed 
discussion of them can be found elsewhere (Balkanski 1993; Di Eugenio 1993). 
9 In the system network notation, vertical ines indicate decision points. The boldfaced names are 
systems, the normal font names are features, and the italicized names are realization statements. The 
ordering realization statements are denoted with the operators > and \], meaning order the clauses in 
the same sentence and order the clauses in separate sentences, respectively. More detail on this 
notation can be found elsewhere (Winograd 1983, ch. 6). 
10 The "??" notation is used to denote a possible form of expression that is not typically found in our 
corpus; it does not indicate ungrammaticality.

to the last action alone rather than to the sequence of actions. The fronted form, in 
example (3a), makes no such implication. 
As can be seen in Figure 5, the Global feature of the Scope system contains five re- 
alization statements, all making changes to the evolving text structure. In the Remove- 
Phone text, for example, these statements restructure or demote the Remove action in 
the hierarchical structure shown in Figure 6A into a satellite node in the RST structure 
shown in Figure 6B. They do not, however, actually contain the realization statement to
set the textual order of the purpose xpression (which would read Purpose > Nucleus); 
later systems in this branch of the decision network execute this statement. 
The remaining exceptions occur when the purpose is considered optional or con- 
trastive and are handled by Optionality and Contrastiveness, respectively. Here are 
examples of them from the corpus:

Notes on page 3. (Code-a-phone 1989)

? Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations 
In example (4), the action of getting more information is optional, that is, the 
reader may or may not want more information at this point in the text. 11 The purpose 
expression is therefore stated first to set the appropriate context for interpreting the 
prescribed sub-action. In example (5), the purpose of ending a call is stated in contrast 
to placing a call in the previous sentence. It is thus fronted to set the appropriate 
context for the prescribed action. This fronting of contrastive purposes occurred in our 
corpus in the context of three oppositional semantic situations: (1) initiating/ending; 
(2) allowing/preventing; and (3) activating/deactivating. 
The results of this study predict a number of cases in which purposes hould 
not be fronted, which is in contrast o the general claim made by Dixon (1987). He 
claimed that purposes hould always be fronted because this facilitates the top~lown 
construction of a procedural plan by readers as they progress through the text. Our 
results how cases in which this rule is not followed by technical writers, that is, when 
the purpose is neither global, optional, nor contrastive. 
5.2.2 Purpose Form. The form selection sub-network, shown in Figures 712 and 8, 
determines the grammatical form of purpose xpressions. The first element of the form 
selection sub-network is Conditional-Status, which determines whether the high-level 
purpose being expressed has special conditions pertaining to it, such as the expressed 
precondition i  example (6a) or other conditions that restrict he applicability of the 
purpose, as in example (7a) ("to wall unit from which it was taken"). If so, either a by 
purpose or an adjoined purpose xpression is used, depending upon the complexity 
of the resulting sentence as determined by Sentence-Complexity. The slot of these 
forms is always initial and is determined here, rather than in the slot selection sub- 
network just discussed. As was the case in our corpus, IMAGENE expresses purposes 
that involve five or more propositions using the adjoined form and otherwise with 
the by form. Consider the following examples of these situations: 
(6a) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of 
handset and pulling out. (Airfone 1991) 
(6b) ?? To remove phone when instructed (approx. 10 sec.), firmly grasp top of 
handset and pull out. 
(7a) Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken. Insert heel first as 
shown, then push top in firmly. (Airfone 1991) 
(7b) ?? Return handset to wall unit from which it was taken by inserting 
heel first as shown, then pushing top in firmly. 
In example (6a), there is a precondition on the high-level purpose of removing 
the phone, a feature that correlates well with the use of the by form. Example (6b) 
seems to make the incorrect implication that the prescribed actions work only "when 
instructed." In the second example, the by form would similarly be prescribed by 
IMAGENE (because of the condition that the handset be returned "to wall unit from which 
11 The distinction between conditions and optional purposes is under the purview of rhetorical status 
selection and is yet to be addressed. 
12 Curly braces indicate that all sub-networks on the right should be entered. Square brackets indicate 
that all inputs must be true before entering the system on the right. The fact that the Global-Purpose 
feature is required for entry to the Purpose-TNF system, as well as the input conditions represented 
normally in the figure, is indicated with an arrow pointing to the additional input conditions. These 
determinations are made by the Scope system that is not repeated here.

it was taken"), but the number of propositions in the resulting sentence, (7b), appears 
to be too great (return, taken, insert, shown, push), forcing the use of the adjoined 
form, (7a). The adjoined purpose form is an example of a case in which the rhetorical 
structure of a text need not be explicitly signaled with a lexical or grammatical cue 
(except extual order), called an "inferred connective" by Crothers (1979). RST allows 
the representation f this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of 
lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987). 
When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, Purpose- 
TNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF). Example (3a) illustrated this. These 
sorts of context-setting purposes are not demoted to phrase status. This reflects the 
fact that global purposes are not expressed in phrasal form in our corpus. 
The Volitionality system determines whether the purpose xpresses the desire of 
the reader to get some inanimate substance to perform in some volitional way. This 
context usually leads to the use of the so that purpose, as shown in example (3g). 
Quite often these substances are liquids, but may also include other inanimates. What 
distinguishes liquids appears to be their ability to drip or drain over a period of time. 
Consider the following alternate forms for expressing purpose: 
(8a) Sit the person up leaning slightly forward so that blood and saliva can drain 
from his mouth. (Rosenberg 1985) 
(8b) ?? Sit the person up leaning slightly forward in order to allow blood 
and saliva to drain from his mouth. 
The form in example (8a) is more commonly used in our corpus in this context.

Goal-Status determines whether the use of Goal Metonymy is warranted. The 
term Goal is used here as a case relation, corresponding to what is also called theme 
(Allen 1987). This metonymy occurs in purposes in which the direct object (or goal) 
of the purpose clause is more important than the action, as in 
(9) For frequently busy numbers, you'll want to use REDIAL \[7\], and the pause 
will have to be in Redial memory. (Code-a-phone 1989) 
The corpus study revealed that situations in which the full purpose would be 
something like "to handle frequently busy numbers" or "for dealing with frequently 
busy numbers," tend to be expressed using this sort of ellipsis. The goal of the verb, 
in this case the busy numbers, metonymically refers to the action as a whole. 
The remainder of the form selection sub-network, shown in Figure 8, is capable 
of generating three discrete points along the continuum from fully nominal to fully 
verbal forms (Quirk et al 1985), namely the nominalization, the gerund, and to infini- 
tive. These are the forms that were present in our corpus. Nominal-Availability will 
realize a prepositional phrase with a nominalization asthe complement whenever the 
appropriate nominalization exists, as in example (9a). I3 
13 This analysis of nominalizations is an example of the descriptive nature of the current study of 
instructional text. The descriptive observation has been made that when nominalized forms of a verb 
exist in the lexicon, they tend to be used. A full explanatory account, in the spirit of current 
Discourse-Functional studies (e.g., Matthiessen and Thompson 1987; Thompson 1987), would attempt 
to identify the precise aspect of the action or the context of its expression that would dictate the use of 
a nominalization, thus resulting in the development of a nominalized form in the English language. 
Such an account is beyond the scope of the current study. 
47 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 
(9a) Follow the steps in the illustration below, for desk installation. 
(Code-a-phone 1989) 
This use of phrases with nominalizations a  propositional units is common in 
instructional text as well as in academic text (Cumming 1991) and formal text in 
general (Hovy 1987). IMAGENE'S architecture implements a particular interpretation f 
Cumming's proposal (1991) that nominalizations be dealt with at two levels, one at 
which the actions are not specified for nominal or clausal expression, and another in 
which they are. IMAGENE'S Process Structure can be seen as the former level, its Text 
Structure as the latter. 
Even if a nominalization exists, however, it still may not be used depending upon 
the determination f Nominal-Arguments and Nominal-Complexity. These systems, 
based on the examples in our corpus, restrict nominalizations to single, non-complex 
arguments. Consider the following examples: 
(10a) 
(10b) 
(lla) 
(llb) 
Use the VOL LO/HI \[2\] switch to adjust volume to your preferred listening 
level. (Code-a-phone 1989) 
?? Use the VOL LO/HI \[2\] switch for volume adjustment toyour preferred 
listening level. 
FLASH uses proper timing to avoid an accidental hangup. (Code-a-phone 
1989) 
?? FLASH uses proper timing for accidental hangup avoidance. 
In cases (10a) and (11a), taken from our corpus, there were nominalizations avail- 
able, namely "adjustment" and "avoidance," but neither was used. The adjustment 
nominalization i (10b) was apparently not used because it required more than one 
argument. The avoidance nominalization i (11b) appears to have been rejected be- 
cause the argument "accidental hangup" was itself a nominalization and thus too 
complex. In both cases, the to infinitive form was preferred. 
If no nominalization is available, TNF-Arguments will produce the to infinitive 
(TNF), unless the infinitive form requires the expression of redundant arguments. Here 
is an example of this case: 
(12a) The BATT LOW Light \[9\] comes ON when the battery is weak. The 
handset must be returned to the base for recharging. (Code-a-phone 1989) 
(12b) ?? The BATT LOW Light \[9\] comes ON when the battery is weak. The 
handset must be returned to the base to recharge (the battery?). 
Examples imilar to (12a) were found in the corpus, whereas those similar to the 
alternative to infinitive expression, (12b), were not. 
5.3 The Remove-Phone Example 
As an example of the data structures used by IMAGENE, consider the PRL representation 
of the actions from the Remove-Phone t xt, depicted graphically in Figure 9. '4 Note 
14 Return-Action is a child of Place-Action because we have viewed it as the first of the sub-actions of 
"placing a call." In cases such as this one, the procedural distinction between child and sibling actions 
is a tricky one (see Di Eugenio 1993). We have routinely classified actions expressed with to infinitive 
constructions as parent nodes rather than as sibling nodes. We leave a more complete treatment of this 
distinction to future work.

that this structure is currently built by hand. It is assumed that it could be constructed 
using artificial intelligence planning methodologies. Note also that the PRL structure, 
in the various slots for each node, specifies the Penman lexical entries for most of the 
lexical choice issues, thus allowing IMAGENE to concentrate on expressing procedural 
relations. 
Given this structural representation f a sequence of actions, the Content and 
Rhetorical Status Selection system sub-network can be viewed as using, the inquiry 
responses to produce the TRL structure shown in Figure 10. is Again, this process is 
not the subject of this paper, but is mentioned to provide a more complete discussion 
of the data structures involved. 
The Grammatical Form Selection sub-networks can then be seen as operating on 
the appropriate relations included in this representation a d producing the full TRL 
structure shown in Figure 11. TRL allows the Text Structure to include a representation 
of the hierarchical structure of the text in terms of RST, including both nucleus-satellite 
and multi-nuclear schemata. In addition, TRL specifies the textual order and clause 
combining using additional New-Sentence and Continue-Sentence links. For example, 
the Instruct, Grasp, Remove, and Pull nodes are all combined into one sentence in 
Figure 11. Finally, TRL specifies the grammatical form of each action expression using 
three features that may be attached to expressible nodes in the structure. The Form 
feature specifies the general grammatical form. For example, the Instruct is marked as

This text is identical to the original text with respect to the four lexical and gram- 
matical issues addressed here. There are, however, a number of other lexical and 
phrasal differences, including the lexical items chosen for the object references and the 
use of determiners. These differences arise from the fact that the current study has 
not specifically addressed the issue of referring expressions. Currently, IMAGENE uses 
simple algorithms for pronominalization a d determiners, which are not based on a 
detailed corpus study of the forms and functions of the object reference domain. A 
50 
Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations 
study of referring expressions, imilar to our work on expressing rhetorical relations, 
would allow the development of a more principled solution to this problem. 
5.4 More Examples of IMAGENE's Output 
This section includes examples of IMAGENE'S output for the fundamental relations dealt 
with in the current study, that is, Purpose, Precondition, Result, and action Sequence. 
It is intended to demonstrate IMAGENE'S breadth of coverage and will not discuss the 
details of how the forms are motivated. 
Given the choice to express an action, rhetorically, as a purpose, IMAGENE is capable 
of producing seven grammatical forms for its expression, most of which can be either 
fronted or not fronted. Here are the various forms, as generated by IMAGENE according 
to the distinctions discussed in the previous section: 
(14a) 
(14b) 
(14c) 
(14d) 
(14e) 
To end a call, hold down the FLASH button for two seconds, then release it. 
Follow steps in the illustration for desk installation. 
Use the OFF position for charging the batteries. 
Use the REDIAL for frequently busy numbers. 
When you are instructed, remove the phone by grasping the top of the handset 
and pulling it. 
(14f) Remove the phone. Grasp the top of the handset, and pull it. 
(14g) Tilt the pan so that the fluid drains out. 
Given the choice to express an action, rhetorically, as a precondition, IMAGENE is 
capable of producing four grammatical forms for its expression, all of which can be 
either fronted or not fronted and also linked with various lexical items. Here are some 
representative forms, as generated by IMAGENE: 
(15a) If light flashes, insert credit card. 
(15b) The BATTERY LOW INDICATOR will light when the battery is low. 
(15c) When the phone is installed, and the battery is~harged, move the 
OFF/STBY/TALK switch to the STBY position. 
(15d) Return the OFF/STBY/TALK switch to the STBY position after your call. 
There are two types of results that IMAGENE supports. The first type is non-reader 
actions that are not the result of an explicit command to monitor a particular device 
state. IMAGENE expresses this type of result as a future tense clause, as seen in exam- 
ple (16a). The second type is not based on an action in  the Process Structure at all, 
but rather, is a span added by the system networks to signal a state resulting from an 
expressed action. IMAGENE expresses these as present ense relational expressions, as 
seen in example (16b). Here are examples of these forms: 
(16a) 
(16b) 
The BATTERY LOW INDICATOR will light when the battery is low. 
When the phone is installed, and the battery is charged, move the 
OFF/STBY/TALK switch to the STBY position. The phone is now ready to use. 
51 
Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 
Simple sequential actions do not fit into the categories discussed above and are 
marked as imperative commands. These commands are combined into clauses by the 
sentence tools system network using and when the concurrency that could be implied 
is impossible or inconsequential, s in example (140, or then when there is possible 
unwanted concurrency, as in example (14a). 
6. Verifying IMAGENE's Prescriptions 
Finally, we compare the output of the text generator with the text in the corpus. For this 
purpose, IMAGENE'S system network was re-run for all of the approximately 600 action 
expressions, both those from the training set and those from the testing set. Statistics 
were kept on how well its realizations matched the expressions in the corpus. 16 These 
tests were performed without he Penman realization component engaged, comparing 
the TRL output of the system network with the corpus text. This way, the extensive 
lexicon that would have been necessary for the surface realization was not required. 
IMAGENE currently includes a domain model and lexical entries for cordless telephones 
and a few other specific examples. 
The match was judged on four separate lexical and grammatical issues: linker, 
form, slot, and clause combining. The resulting TRL structure had to specify the iden- 
tical linker (either preposition or conjunction), form (tense, aspect, mood, and voice, or 
non-finite verb or nominalization), slot (textual order), and combining (if the expres- 
sion was combined with the following one). An example of this verification process 
can be found in Section 5.3, in which the IMAGENE-produced Remove-Phone t xt is 
shown to match the original text on all four of these issues. 
Note that the match must be exact. For example, if IMAGENE specifies the con- 
junction and for a sequence xpression when then occurs in the text, the choice of 
linker would be counted as incorrect, in spite of the fact that the resulting text might 
be quite understandable. Note also that IMAGENE'S realizations may even be better in 
some cases than the text in the corpus. Although the general philosophy of the ap- 
proach taken in the current study is to assume that the choices made by the writers 
of the corpus are correct, there are isolated cases ~in which the forms in the corpus are 
probably inappropriate. IMAGENE embodies choices that are consistently made over a 
range of instructions and thus does not reflect isolated examples. 
The analysis conducted in step 2 has been based primarily on a small subset of the 
full corpus, namely on the instructions for a set of three cordless telephone manuals. 
This training set constitutes approximately 35% of our corpus. The results of this 
analysis were then implemented in IMAGENE and applied to the full corpus, providing 
a detailed characterization f the instructions found in the original telephone manuals 
and a quantitative analysis of how well this characterization applies to the other forms 
of instructions. IMAGENE's realizations correctly match all four lexical and grammatical 
issues in 71% of the expressions in the training set and 52% in the testing set. The 
specific levels of match for the four most common rhetorical relations are detailed 
in Figures 12 and 13. There is one table for each of the major rhetorical relations, 
Purpose, Precondition, Result, and Sequence. 17These tables show the percentage of
16 The training corpus included some non-procedural text that was included for a pilot study done before 
the focus on procedural text had been determined. It is not handled particularly well by IMAGENE, and 
the results given in this section will not include it. The testing set is exclusively procedural and is 
included in full. 
17 Because there are relatively few concurrent expressions in our corpus, only 33, those results are not 
included in this section.

The accuracy of IMAGENE's real izations for Purpose and  Precondit ion expressions. 
IMAGENE'S realizations for linker, form, slot, and clause combining that matched those 
in the corpus, differentiating between the training set and the testing set. As can be 
seen in all of the charts, the level of match is better for the training set, but still good 
for the testing set. 
For purpose expressions, IMAGENE makes use of four different linkers (by, for, so 
that, and no linker) and six different forms (to infinitive, imperative, nominalization, 
gerund, goal metonymy, and simple present tense action) and produces a match on all 
four lexical and grammatical issues for 81% of the purpose xpressions in the training 
set and 59% in the testing set. Figure 12 gives a breakdown of IMAGENE's accuracy 
for the four lexical and grammatical issues. To judge these results more fully, consider 
an alternative system that always generates the single most common purpose form. 
In our corpus, this is the fronted to infinitive, which occurred in 34% of the purpose 
expressions. TM Such a system would score 34% under the verification criteria used here. 
For precondition expressions, the most common form in our corpus is the fronted 
if present ense clause, which occurred in 19% of the 98 precondition expressions in
the corpus. IMAGENE, which produces five linkers and nine forms, produces a match 
for 67% of the precondition expressions in the training set and 35% in the testing set. 
As can be seen in the precondition chart in Figure 12, IMAGENE's accuracy is lower for 
preconditions than for purposes, particularly in the testing set. This reflects the greater 
diversity of procedural contexts in which preconditions arise and the corresponding 
diversity of the forms used to express them (see Vander Linden 1994). Certainly, a 
larger training set is required here, but it is not clear at this point how much larger it 
18 Table 1 indicates 32%, but that would be for our corpus with the non-procedural portions of text 
included. They have been removed here to remain consistent with the statistics hown in this section.

7. Conclusions 
This paper has addressed the problem of determining the precise lexical and gram- 
matical forms for expressing procedural relations between actions in the context of 
instructional text generation. The corpus-based methodology employed is well suited 
for this problem, providing both a principled means for cataloging the lexical and 
grammatical forms that are consistently used in instructional text and an environment 
for testing and confirming hypotheses concerning the contextual issues that co-vary 
with these forms. 
The issues of procedural planning, user modeling, and content selection, although 
of unquestionable importance to the broad goal of generating instructions, were not 
specifically addressed here. The current study makes a number of prescriptions for the 
type of information that such techniques would need to provide to the text planner 
pursuant o the generation of instructional text, but says nothing about how they 
should be implemented in order to achieve this. 
There are two fundamental contributions of the current study to the field of com- 
putational linguistics. The first is the analysis of instructional text itself. The current 
study has provided a characterization f certain aspects of instructional text that has 
been effectively applied to the generation of instructional text in general. This char- 
acterization is directly applicable to current work on instructional text, particularly in 
the context of natural anguage generation. The results can also serve as a source of 
preliminary hypotheses with respect o the analysis of other related genres.

The second is the detailed presentation of a methodology for managing diversity of 
expression at the textual evel in the context of text generation. The approach involves 
collecting a suitable corpus of text, analyzing that text, implementing the results of the 
analysis in a text generator, and verifying the output of the generator. This approach 
is applicable not just to the problem of expressing procedural relations in instructional 
text, but rather to any lexical or grammatical aspect of any linguistic genre.
