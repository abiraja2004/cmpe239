Abstract 
Conventional confusion network based 
system combination for machine translation 
(MT) heavily relies on features that are 
based on the measure of agreement of 
words in different translation hypotheses. 
This paper presents two new features that 
consider agreement of n-grams in different 
hypotheses to improve the performance of 
system combination. The first one is based 
on a sentence specific online n-gram 
language model, and the second one is 
based on n-gram voting. Experiments on a 
large scale Chinese-to-English MT task 
show that both features yield significant 
improvements on the translation 
performance, and a combination of them 
produces even better translation results. 
1 Introduction1 
In past years, the confusion network based system 
combination approach has been shown with 
substantial improvements in various machine 
translation (MT) tasks (Bangalore, et. al., 2001, 
Matusov, et. al., 2006, Rosti, et. al., 2007, He, 
et. al., 2008). Given hypotheses of multiple 
systems, a confusion network is built by aligning 
all these hypotheses. The resulting network 
comprises a sequence of correspondence sets, each 
of which contains the alternative words that are 
aligned with each other. To derive a consensus 
hypothesis from the confusion network, decoding 
is performed by selecting a path with the maximum 
overall confidence score among all paths that pass 
the confusion network (Goel, et. al., 2004).

Microsoft Research 
The confidence score of a hypothesis could be 
assigned in various ways. Fiscus (1997) used 
voting by frequency of word occurrences. Mangu 
et. al., (2000) computed a word posterior 
probability based on voting of that word in 
different hypotheses. Moreover, the overall 
confidence score is usually formulated as a log-
linear model including extra features including 
language model (LM) score, word count, etc.  
Features based on word agreement measure are 
extensively studied in past work (Matusov, et. al., 
2006, Rosti, et. al., 2007, He, et. al., 2008). 
However, utilization of n-gram agreement 
information among the hypotheses has not been 
fully explored yet. Moreover, it was argued that 
the confusion network decoding may introduce 
undesirable spur words that break coherent 
phrases (Sim, et. al., 2007). Therefore, we would 
prefer the consensus translation that has better n-
gram agreement among outputs of single systems.  
In the literature, Zens and Ney (2004) 
proposed an n-gram posterior probability based 
LM for MT. For each source sentence, a LM is 
trained on the n-best list produced by a single MT 
system and is used to re-rank that n-best list itself. 
On the other hand, Matusov et al (2008) proposed 
an ?adapted? LM for system combination, where 
this ?adapted? LM is trained on translation 
hypotheses of the whole test corpus from all single 
MT systems involved in system combination.  
Inspired by these ideas, we propose two new 
features based on n-gram agreement measure to 
improve the performance of system combination. 
The first one is a sentence specific LM built on 
translation hypotheses of multiple systems; the 
second one is n-gram-voting-based confidence. 
Experimental results are presented in the context of 
a large-scale Chinese-English translation task.

2 System Combination for MT  
One of the most successful approaches for 
system combination for MT is based on 
confusion network decoding as described in 
(Rosti, et. al., 2007). Given translation 
hypotheses from multiple MT systems, one of 
the hypotheses is selected as the backbone for 
the use of hypothesis alignment. This is usually 
done by a sentence-level minimum Bayes risk 
(MBR) re-ranking method. The confusion 
network is constructed by aligning all these 
hypotheses against the backbone. Words that 
align to each other are grouped into a 
correspondence set, constituting competition 
links of the confusion network. Each path in the 
network passes exactly one link from each 
correspondence set. The final consensus output 
relies on a decoding procedure that chooses a 
path with the maximum confidence score among 
all paths that pass the confusion network. 
 The confidence score of a hypothesis is 
usually formalized as a log-linear sum of several 
feature functions. Given a source language 
sentence ? , the total confidence of a target 
language hypothesis ? = (?1 ,? , ??)  in the 
confusion network can be represented as:  
???? ? ? = ??? ? ?? ?,? 
?
?=1
+ ?1?????? ? 
+ ?2?????? (?) 
(1) 
where the feature functions include word 
posterior probability  ?(?? |?,?), LM probability 
???(?), and the number of real words ??????  in 
? . Usually, the model parameter ?i could be 
trained by optimizing an evaluation metric, e.g., 
BLEU score, on a held-out development set.  
3 N-gram Online Language Model  
Given a source sentence ?, the fractional count 
? ?1
? ?  of an n-gram ?1
?  is defined as: 
? ?1
?  ? =   ? ??  ? 
?
?=??????
?(? ? ???+1
?
, ?1
?) (2) 
where ??  denotes the hypothesis set, ? ?,?  
denotes the Kronecker function, and ?(?? |?) is 
the posterior probability of translation 
hypothesis ?? , which is expressed as the 
weighted sum of the system specific posterior 
probabilities through the systems that contains 
hypothesis ?? , 
? ? ? =  ???(?
?
?=1
 ?? ,? 1(? ? ??? ) (3) 
where ??  is the weight for the posterior 
probability of the kth system ?? , and 1 ?  is the 
indicator function.   
Follows Rosti, et. al. (2007), system specific 
posteriors are derived based on a rank-based 
scoring scheme. I.e., if translation hypothesis ??  
is the rth best output in the n-best list of system 
?? , posterior ? ??  ?? ,?  is approximated as:  
? ??  ?? ,? =
1/(1 + ?)?  
 1/(1 + ??)?
||??? ||
? ?=1
 (4) 
where ? is a rank smoothing parameter. 
Similar to (Zens and Ney, 2004), a 
straightforward approach of using n-gram 
fractional counts is to formulate it as a sentence 
specific online LM. Then the online LM score 
of a path in the confusion network will be added 
as an additional feature in the log-linear model 
for decoding. The online n-gram LM score is 
computed by: 
?(?? |????+1
??1 ,?) =
?(????+1
? |?)
?(????+1
??1 |?)
 (5) 
The LM score of hypothesis ? is obtained by: 
??? ? ? = ? ?? |????+1
??1 ,? 
?
?=?
 (6) 
Since new n-grams unseen in original 
translation hypotheses may be proposed by the 
CN decoder, LM smoothing is critical. In our 
approach, the score of the online LM is 
smoothed by taking a linear interpolation to 
combine scores of different orders.  
206
?????? ? ?? |????+1
??1 ,? 
=  ???(?? |????+1
??1 ,?)
?
?=1
 
(7) 
In our implementation, the interpolation weights 
{ ?? } can be learned along with other 
combination parameters in the same Max-BLEU 
training scheme via Powell's search.  
4 N-gram-Voting-Based Confidence  
Motivated by features based on voting of single 
word, we proposed new features based on N-
gram voting. The voting score ? ?1
?  ?  of an n-
gram ?1
?  is computed as: 
? ?1
?  ? =  ? ??  ? 1(?1
? ? ??)?????       (8) 
It receives a vote from each hypothesis that 
contains that n-gram, and weighted by the 
posterior probability of that hypothesis, where 
the posterior probability ? ??  ?  is computed by 
(3). Unlike the fractional count, each hypothesis 
can vote no more than once on an n-gram. 
? ?1
?  ?  takes a value between 0 and 1. It 
can be viewed as the confidence of the n-gram 
?1
? . Then the n-gram-voting-based confidence 
score of a hypothesis ?  is computed as the 
product of confidence scores of n-grams in E: 
??? ,? ? ? = ??? ,? ?1
?  ?,? =
                                  ?(??
?+??1|?)???+1?=1   
(9) 
where n can take the value of 2, 3, ?, N. In 
order to prevent zero confidence, a small back-
off confidence score is assigned to all n-grams 
unseen in original hypotheses.  
Augmented with the proposed n-gram based 
features, the final log-linear model becomes: 
???? ? ? 
= ???? ??  ?,? 
?
?=1
+ ?1?????? ? 
+ ?2??????  ? + ?3?????? ? ? 
+ ??+2?????? ,? ? ? 
?
?=2

5 Evaluation 
We evaluate the proposed n-gram based features 
on the Chinese-to-English (C2E) test in the past 
NIST Open MT Evaluations. The experimental 
results are reported in case sensitive BLEU 
score (Papineni, et. al., 2002). 
The dev set, which is used for system 
combination parameter training, is the newswire 
and newsgroup parts of NIST MT06, which 
contains a total of 1099 sentences. The test set is 
the "current" test set of NIST MT08, which 
contains 1357 sentences of newswire and web-
blog data. Both dev and test sets have four 
reference translations per sentence.  
Outputs from a total of eight single MT 
systems were combined for consensus 
translations. These selected systems are based 
on various translation paradigms, such as 
phrasal, hierarchical, and syntax-based systems. 
Each system produces 10-best hypotheses per 
translation. The BLEU score range for the eight 
individual systems are from 26.11% to 31.09% 
on the dev set and from 20.42% to 26.24% on 
the test set. In our experiments, a state-of-the-art 
system combination method proposed by He, et. 
al. (2008) is implemented as the baseline. The 
true-casing model proposed by Toutanova et al 
(2008) is used. 
Table 1 shows results of adding the online 
LM feature. Different LM orders up to four are 
tested. Results show that using a 2-gram online 
LM yields a half BLEU point gain over the 
baseline. However, the gain is saturated after a 
LM order of three, and fluctuates after that.  
Table 2 shows the performance of using n-
gram-voting-based confidence features. The best 
result of 31.01% is achieved when up to 4-gram 
confidence features are used. The BLEU score 
keeps improving when longer n-gram 
confidence features are added. This indicates 
that the n-gram voting based confidence feature 
is robust to high order n-grams. 
We further experimented with incorporating 
both features in the log-linear model and 
reported the results in Table 3. Given the 
observation that the n-gram voting based 
confidence feature is more robust to high order 
n-grams, we further tested using different n-
gram orders for them. As shown in Table 3, 
using 3-gram online LM plus 2~4-gram voting 
207
based confidence scores yields the best BLEU 
scores on both dev and test sets, which are 
37.98% and 31.35%, respectively. This is a 0.84 
BLEU point gain over the baseline on the MT08 
test set.

6 Conclusion 
This work explored utilization of n-gram 
agreement information among translation 
outputs of multiple MT systems to improve the 
performance of system combination. This is an 
extension of an earlier idea presented at the 
NIPS 2008 Workshop on Speech and Language 
(Yong and He 2008). Two kinds of n-gram based 
features were proposed. The first is based on an 
online LM using n-gram fractional counts, and 
the second is a confidence feature based on n-
gram voting scores. Our experiments on the 
NIST MT08 Chinese-English task showed that 
both methods yield nice improvements on the 
translation results, and incorporating both kinds 
of features produced the best translation result 
with a BLEU score of 31.35%, which is a 0.84% 
improvement.
