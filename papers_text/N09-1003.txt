Abstract
This paper presents and compares WordNet-
based and distributional similarity approaches.
The strengths and weaknesses of each ap-
proach regarding similarity and relatedness
tasks are discussed, and a combination is pre-
sented. Each of our methods independently
provide the best results in their class on the
RG and WordSim353 datasets, and a super-
vised combination of them yields the best pub-
lished results on all datasets. Finally, we pio-
neer cross-lingual similarity, showing that our
methods are easily adapted for a cross-lingual
task with minor losses.
1 Introduction
Measuring semantic similarity and relatedness be-
tween terms is an important problem in lexical se-
mantics. It has applications in many natural lan-
guage processing tasks, such as Textual Entailment,
Word Sense Disambiguation or Information Extrac-
tion, and other related areas like Information Re-
trieval. The techniques used to solve this problem
can be roughly classified into two main categories:
those relying on pre-existing knowledge resources
(thesauri, semantic networks, taxonomies or ency-
clopedias) (Alvarez and Lim, 2007; Yang and Pow-
ers, 2005; Hughes and Ramage, 2007) and those in-
ducing distributional properties of words from cor-
pora (Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Chen et al, 2006;
Bollegala et al, 2007).
In this paper, we explore both families. For the
first one we apply graph based algorithms to Word-
Net, and for the second we induce distributional
similarities collected from a 1.6 Terabyte Web cor-
pus. Previous work suggests that distributional sim-
ilarities suffer from certain limitations, which make
them less useful than knowledge resources for se-
mantic similarity. For example, Lin (1998b) finds
similar phrases like captive-westerner which made
sense only in the context of the corpus used, and
Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) highlight other prob-
lems that stem from the imbalance and sparseness of
the corpora. Comparatively, the experiments in this
paper demonstrate that distributional similarities can
perform as well as the knowledge-based approaches,
and a combination of the two can exceed the per-
formance of results previously reported on the same
datasets. An application to cross-lingual (CL) sim-
ilarity identification is also described, with applica-
tions such as CL Information Retrieval or CL spon-
sored search. A discussion on the differences be-
tween learning similarity and relatedness scores is
provided.
The paper is structured as follows. We first
present the WordNet-based method, followed by the
distributional methods. Section 4 is devoted to the
evaluation and results on the monolingual and cross-
lingual tasks. Section 5 presents some analysis, in-
cluding learning curves for distributional methods,
the use of distributional similarity to improve Word-
Net similarity, the contrast between similarity and
relatedness, and the combination of methods. Sec-
tion 6 presents related work, and finally, Section 7
draws the conclusions and mentions future work.
2 WordNet-based method
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a lexical database of
English, which groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs into sets of synonyms (synsets), each ex-
pressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked
with conceptual-semantic and lexical relations, in-
cluding hypernymy, meronymy, causality, etc.
Given a pair of words and a graph-based repre-
sentation of WordNet, our method has basically two
19
steps: We first compute the personalized PageR-
ank over WordNet separately for each of the words,
producing a probability distribution over WordNet
synsets. We then compare how similar these two dis-
crete probability distributions are by encoding them
as vectors and computing the cosine between the
vectors.
We represent WordNet as a graph G = (V,E) as
follows: graph nodes represent WordNet concepts
(synsets) and dictionary words; relations among
synsets are represented by undirected edges; and
dictionary words are linked to the synsets associated
to them by directed edges.
For each word in the pair we first compute a per-
sonalized PageRank vector of graph G (Haveliwala,
2002). Basically, personalized PageRank is com-
puted by modifying the random jump distribution
vector in the traditional PageRank equation. In our
case, we concentrate all probability mass in the tar-
get word.
Regarding PageRank implementation details, we
chose a damping value of 0.85 and finish the calcula-
tion after 30 iterations. These are default values, and
we did not optimize them. Our similarity method is
similar, but simpler, to that used by (Hughes and Ra-
mage, 2007), which report very good results on sim-
ilarity datasets. More details of our algorithm can be
found in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009). The algorithm
and needed resouces are publicly available1.
2.1 WordNet relations and versions
The WordNet versions that we use in this work are
the Multilingual Central Repository or MCR (At-
serias et al, 2004) (which includes English Word-
Net version 1.6 and wordnets for several other lan-
guages like Spanish, Italian, Catalan and Basque),
and WordNet version 3.02. We used all the rela-
tions in MCR (except cooccurrence relations and se-
lectional preference relations) and in WordNet 3.0.
Given the recent availability of the disambiguated
gloss relations for WordNet 3.03, we also used a
version which incorporates these relations. We will
refer to the three versions as MCR16, WN30 and
WN30g, respectively. Our choice was mainly moti-
vated by the fact that MCR contains tightly aligned
1http://http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb/
2Available from http://http://wordnet.princeton.edu/
3http://wordnet.princeton.edu/glosstag
wordnets of several languages (see below).
2.2 Cross-linguality
MCR follows the EuroWordNet design (Vossen,
1998), which specifies an InterLingual Index (ILI)
that links the concepts across wordnets of differ-
ent languages. The wordnets for other languages in
MCR use the English WordNet synset numbers as
ILIs. This design allows a decoupling of the rela-
tions between concepts (which can be taken to be
language independent) and the links from each con-
tent word to its corresponding concepts (which is
language dependent).
As our WordNet-based method uses the graph of
the concepts and relations, we can easily compute
the similarity between words from different lan-
guages. For example, consider a English-Spanish
pair like car ? coche. Given that the Spanish Word-
Net is included in MCR we can use MCR as the
common knowledge-base for the relations. We can
then compute the personalized PageRank for each
of car and coche on the same underlying graph, and
then compare the similarity between both probabil-
ity distributions.
As an alternative, we also tried to use pub-
licly available mappings for wordnets (Daude et al,
2000)4 in order to create a 3.0 version of the Span-
ish WordNet. The mapping was used to link Spanish
variants to 3.0 synsets. We used the English Word-
Net 3.0, including glosses, to construct the graph.
The two Spanish WordNet versions are referred to
as MCR16 and WN30g.
3 Context-based methods
In this section, we describe the distributional meth-
ods used for calculating similarities between words,
and profiting from the use of a large Web-based cor-
pus.
This work is motivated by previous studies that
make use of search engines in order to collect co-
occurrence statistics between words. Turney (2001)
uses the number of hits returned by a Web search
engine to calculate the Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (PMI) between terms, as an indicator of syn-
onymy. Bollegala et al (2007) calculate a number
of popular relatedness metrics based on page counts,
4http://www.lsi.upc.es/?nlp/tools/download-map.php.
20
like PMI, the Jaccard coefficient, the Simpson co-
efficient and the Dice coefficient, which are com-
bined with lexico-syntactic patterns as model fea-
tures. The model parameters are trained using Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) in order to later rank
pairs of words. A different approach is the one taken
by Sahami and Heilman (2006), who collect snip-
pets from the results of a search engine and repre-
sent each snippet as a vector, weighted with the tf?idf
score. The semantic similarity between two queries
is calculated as the inner product between the cen-
troids of the respective sets of vectors.
To calculate the similarity of two words w1 and
w2, Ruiz-Casado et al (2005) collect snippets con-
taining w1 from a Web search engine, extract a con-
text around it, replace it with w2 and check for the
existence of that modified context in the Web.
Using a search engine to calculate similarities be-
tween words has the drawback that the data used will
always be truncated. So, for example, the numbers
of hits returned by search engines nowadays are al-
ways approximate and rounded up. The systems that
rely on collecting snippets are also limited by the
maximum number of documents returned per query,
typically around a thousand. We hypothesize that
by crawling a large corpus from the Web and doing
standard corpus analysis to collect precise statistics
for the terms we should improve over other unsu-
pervised systems that are based on search engine
results, and should yield results that are competi-
tive even when compared to knowledge-based ap-
proaches.
In order to calculate the semantic similarity be-
tween the words in a set, we have used a vector space
model, with the following three variations:
In the bag-of-words approach, for each word w
in the dataset we collect every term t that appears in
a window centered in w, and add them to the vector
together with its frequency.
In the context window approach, for each word
w in the dataset we collect every window W cen-
tered in w (removing the central word), and add it
to the vector together with its frequency (the total
number of times we saw windowW around w in the
whole corpus). In this case, all punctuation symbols
are replaced with a special token, to unify patterns
like , the <term> said to and ? the <term> said to.
Throughout the paper, when we mention a context
window of size N it means N words at each side of
the phrase of interest.
In the syntactic dependency approach, we parse
the entire corpus using an implementation of an In-
ductive Dependency parser as described in Nivre
(2006). For each word w we collect a template of
the syntactic context. We consider sequences of gov-
erning words (e.g. the parent, grand-parent, etc.) as
well as collections of descendants (e.g., immediate
children, grandchildren, etc.). This information is
then encoded as a contextual template. For example,
the context template cooks <term> delicious could
be contexts for nouns such as food, meals, pasta, etc.
This captures both syntactic preferences as well as
selectional preferences. Contrary to Pado and Lap-
ata (2007), we do not use the labels of the syntactic
dependencies.
Once the vectors have been obtained, the fre-
quency for each dimension in every vector is
weighted using the other vectors as contrast set, with
the ?2 test, and finally the cosine similarity between
vectors is used to calculate the similarity between
each pair of terms.
Except for the syntactic dependency approach,
where closed-class words are needed by the parser,
in the other cases we have removed stopwords (pro-
nouns, prepositions, determiners and modal and
auxiliary verbs).
3.1 Corpus used
We have used a corpus of four billion documents,
crawled from the Web in August 2008. An HTML
parser is used to extract text, the language of each
document is identified, and non-English documents
are discarded. The final corpus remaining at the end
of this process contains roughly 1.6 Terawords. All
calculations are done in parallel sharding by dimen-
sion, and it is possible to calculate all pairwise sim-
ilarities of the words in the test sets very quickly
on this corpus using the MapReduce infrastructure.
A complete run takes around 15 minutes on 2,000
cores.
3.2 Cross-linguality
In order to calculate similarities in a cross-lingual
setting, where some of the words are in a language l
other than English, the following algorithm is used:

4 Experimental results
4.1 Gold-standard datasets
We have used two standard datasets. The first
one, RG, consists of 65 pairs of words collected by
Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965), who had them
judged by 51 human subjects in a scale from 0.0 to
4.0 according to their similarity, but ignoring any
other possible semantic relationships that might ap-
pear between the terms. The second dataset, Word-
Sim3535 (Finkelstein et al, 2002) contains 353 word
pairs, each associated with an average of 13 to 16 hu-
man judgements. In this case, both similarity and re-

latedness are annotated without any distinction. Sev-
eral studies indicate that the human scores consis-
tently have very high correlations with each other
(Miller and Charles, 1991; Resnik, 1995), thus val-
idating the use of these datasets for evaluating se-
mantic similarity.
For the cross-lingual evaluation, the two datasets
were modified by translating the second word in
each pair into Spanish. Two humans translated
simultaneously both datasets, with an inter-tagger
agreement of 72% for RG and 84% for Word-
Sim353.
4.2 Results
Table 1 shows the Spearman correlation obtained on
the RG and WordSim353 datasets, including the in-
terval at 0.95 of confidence6.
Overall the distributional context-window ap-
proach performs best in the RG, reaching 0.89 corre-
lation, and both WN30g and the combination of con-
text windows and syntactic context perform best on
WordSim353. Note that the confidence intervals are
quite large in both RG and WordSim353, and few of
the pairwise differences are statistically significant.
Regarding WordNet-based approaches, the use of
the glosses and WordNet 3.0 (WN30g) yields the
best results in both datasets. While MCR16 is close
to WN30g for the RG dataset, it lags well behind
on WordSim353. This discrepancy is further ana-
lyzed is Section 5.3. Note that the performance of
WordNet in the WordSim353 dataset suffers from
unknown words. In fact, there are nine pairs which
returned null similarity for this reason. The num-
6To calculate the Spearman correlations values are trans-
formed into ranks, and we calculate the Pearson correlation on
them. The confidence intervals refer to the Pearson correlations
of the rank vectors.

ber in parenthesis in Table 1 for WordSim353 shows
the results for the 344 remaining pairs. Section 5.2
shows a proposal to overcome this limitation.
The bag-of-words approach tends to group to-
gether terms that can have a similar distribution of
contextual terms. Therefore, terms that are topically
related can appear in the same textual passages and
will get high values using this model. We see this
as an explanation why this model performed better
than the context window approach for WordSim353,
where annotators were instructed to provide high
ratings to related terms. On the contrary, the con-
text window approach tends to group together words
that are exchangeable in exactly the same context,
preserving order. Table 2 illustrates a few exam-
ples of context collected. Therefore, true synonyms
and hyponyms/hyperonyms will receive high simi-
larities, whereas terms related topically or based on
any other semantic relation (e.g. movie and star) will
have lower scores. This explains why this method
performed better for the RG dataset. Section 5.3
confirms these observations.
4.3 Cross-lingual similarity
Table 3 shows the results for the English-Spanish
cross-lingual datasets. For RG, MCR16 and the
context windows methods drop only 5 percentage
points, showing that cross-lingual similarity is feasi-
ble, and that both cross-lingual strategies are robust.
The results for WordSim353 show that WN30g is
the best for this dataset, with the rest of the meth-
ods falling over 10 percentage points relative to the
monolingual experiment. A closer look at the Word-
Net results showed that most of the drop in perfor-
mance was caused by out-of-vocabulary words, due
to the smaller vocabulary of the Spanish WordNet.
Though not totally comparable, if we compute the
correlation over pairs covered in WordNet alne, the
correlation would drop only 2 percentage points. In
the case of the distributional approaches, the fall in
performance was caused by the translations, as only
61% of the words were translated into the original
word in the English datasets.
5 Detailed analysis and system
combination
In this section we present some analysis, including
learning curves for distributional methods, the use
of distributional similarity to improve WordNet sim-
ilarity, the contrast between similarity and related-
ness, and the combination of methods.
5.1 Learning curves for distributional methods
Figure 1 shows that the correlation improves with
the size of the corpus, as expected. For the re-
sults using the WordSim353 corpus, we show the
results of the bag-of-words approach with context
size 10. Results improve from 0.5 Spearman correla-
tion up to 0.65 when increasing the corpus size three
orders of magnitude, although the effect decays at
the end, which indicates that we might not get fur-

ther gains going beyond the current size of the cor-
pus. With respect to results for the RG dataset, we
used a context-window approach with context radius
4. Here, results improve even more with data size,
probably due to the sparse data problem collecting
8-word context windows if the corpus is not large
enough. Correlation improves linearly right to the
end, where results stabilize around 0.89.
5.2 Combining both approaches: dealing with
unknown words in WordNet
Although the vocabulary of WordNet is very ex-
tensive, applications are bound to need the similar-
ity between words which are not included in Word-
Net. This is exemplified in the WordSim353 dataset,
where 9 pairs contain words which are unknown to
WordNet. In order to overcome this shortcoming,
we could use similar words instead, as provided by
the distributional thesaurus. We used the distribu-
tional thesaurus defined in Section 3, using context
windows of width 4, to provide three similar words
for each of the unknown words in WordNet. Results
improve for both WN30 and WN30g, as shown in
Table 4, attaining our best results for WordSim353.
5.3 Similarity vs. relatedness
We mentioned above that the annotation guidelines
of WordSim353 did not distinguish between simi-
lar and related pairs. As the results in Section 4
show, different techniques are more appropriate to
calculate either similarity or relatedness. In order to
study this effect, ideally, we would have two ver-
sions of the dataset, where annotators were given
precise instructions to distinguish similarity in one
case, and relatedness in the other. Given the lack
of such datasets, we devised a simpler approach in
order to reuse the existing human judgements. We
manually split the dataset in two parts, as follows.
First, two humans classified all pairs as be-
ing synonyms of each other, antonyms, iden-
tical, hyperonym-hyponym, hyponym-hyperonym,
holonym-meronym, meronym-holonym, and none-
of-the-above. The inter-tagger agreement rate was
0.80, with a Kappa score of 0.77. This anno-
tation was used to group the pairs in three cate-
gories: similar pairs (those classified as synonyms,
antonyms, identical, or hyponym-hyperonym), re-
lated pairs (those classified as meronym-holonym,
and pairs classified as none-of-the-above, with a hu-
man average similarity greater than 5), and unrelated
pairs (those classified as none-of-the-above that had
average similarity less than or equal to 5). We then
created two new gold-standard datasets: similarity
(the union of similar and unrelated pairs), and relat-
edness (the union of related and unrelated)7.
Table 5 shows the results on the relatedness and
similarity subsets of WordSim353 for the different
methods. Regarding WordNet methods, both WN30
and WN30g perform similarly on the similarity sub-
set, but WN30g obtains the best results by far on
the relatedness data. These results are congruent
with our expectations: two words are similar if their
synsets are in close places in the WordNet hierarchy,
and two words are related if there is a connection
between them. Most of the relations in WordNet
are of hierarchical nature, and although other rela-
tions exist, they are far less numerous, thus explain-
ing the good results for both WN30 and WN30g on
similarity, but the bad results of WN30 on related-
ness. The disambiguated glosses help find connec-
tions among related concepts, and allow our method
to better model relatedness with respect to WN30.
The low results for MCR16 also deserve some
comments. Given the fact that MCR16 performed
very well on the RG dataset, it comes as a surprise
that it performs so poorly for the similarity subset
of WordSim353. In an additional evaluation, we at-
tested that MCR16 does indeed perform as well as
MCR30g on the similar pairs subset. We believe
that this deviation could be due to the method used to
construct the similarity dataset, which includes some
pairs of loosely related pairs labeled as unrelated.

Concerning the techniques based on distributional
similarities, the method based on context windows
provides the best results for similarity, and the bag-
of-words representation outperforms most of the
other techniques for relatedness.
5.4 Supervised combination
In order to gain an insight on which would be the up-
per bound that we could obtain when combining our
methods, we took the output of three systems (bag
of words with window size 10, context window with
size 4, and the WN30g run). Each of these outputs is
a ranking of word pairs, and we implemented an or-
acle that chooses, for each pair, the rank that is most
similar to the rank of the pair in the gold-standard.
The outputs of the oracle have a Spearman correla-
tion of 0.97 for RG and 0.92 for WordSim353, which
gives as an indication of the correlations that could
be achieved by choosing for each pair the rank out-
put by the best classifier for that pair.
The previous results motivated the use of a su-
pervised approach to combine the output of the
different systems. We created a training cor-
pus containing pairs of pairs of words from the
datasets, having as features the similarity and rank
of each pair involved as given by the differ-
ent unsupervised systems. A classifier is trained
to decide whether the first pair is more simi-
lar than the second one. For example, a train-
ing instance using two unsupervised classifiers is
0.001364, 31, 0.327515, 64, 0.084805, 57, 0.109061, 59, negative
meaning that the similarities given by the first clas-
sifier to the two pairs were 0.001364 and 0.327515
respectively, which ranked them in positions 31 and
64. The second classifier gave them similarities of
0.084805 and 0.109061 respectively, which ranked
them in positions 57 and 59. The class negative in-
dicates that in the gold-standard the first pair has a
lower score than the second pair.
We have trained a SVM to classify pairs of pairs,
and use its output to rank the entries in both datasets.
It uses a polynomial kernel with degree 4. We did

not have a held-out set, so we used the standard set-
tings of Weka, without trying to modify parameters,
e.g. C. Each word pair is scored with the number
of pairs that were considered to have less similar-
ity using the SVM. The results using 10-fold cross-
validation are shown in Table 6. A combination of
all methods produces the best results reported so far
for both datasets, statistically significant for RG.
6 Related work
Contrary to the WordSim353 dataset, common prac-
tice with the RG dataset has been to perform the
evaluation with Pearson correlation. In our believe
Pearson is less informative, as the Pearson correla-
tion suffers much when the scores of two systems are
not linearly correlated, something which happens
often given due to the different nature of the tech-
niques applied. Some authors, e.g. Alvarez and Lim
(2007), use a non-linear function to map the system
outputs into new values distributed more similarly
to the values in the gold-standard. In their case, the
mapping function was exp (?x4 ), which was chosenempirically. Finding such a function is dependent
on the dataset used, and involves an extra step in the
similarity calculations. Alternatively, the Spearman
correlation provides an evaluation metric that is in-
dependent of such data-dependent transformations.
Most similarity researchers have published their

complete results on a smaller subset of the RG
dataset containing 30 word pairs (Miller and
Charles, 1991), usually referred to as MC, making it
possible to compare different systems using differ-
ent correlation. Table 7 shows the results of related
work on MC that was available to us, including our
own. For the authors that did not provide the de-
tailed data we include only the Pearson correlation
with no confidence intervals.
Among the unsupervised methods introduced in
this paper, the context window produced the best re-
ported Spearman correlation, although the 0.95 con-
fidence intervals are too large to allow us to accept
the hypothesis that it is better than all others meth-
ods. The supervised combination produces the best
results reported so far. For the benefit of future re-
search, our results for the MC subset are displayed
in Table 8.
Comparison on the WordSim353 dataset is eas-
ier, as all researchers have used Spearman. The
figures in Table 9) show that our WordNet-based
method outperforms all previously published Word-
Net methods. We want to note that our WordNet-
based method outperforms that of Hughes and Ram-
age (2007), which uses a similar method. Although
there are some differences in the method, we think
that the main performance gain comes from the use
of the disambiguated glosses, which they did not
use. Our distributional methods also outperform all
other corpus-based methods. The most similar ap-
proach to our distributional technique is Finkelstein
et al (2002), who combined distributional similar-
ities from Web documents with a similarity from
WordNet. Their results are probably worse due to
the smaller data size (they used 270,000 documents)
and the differences in the calculation of the simi-
larities. The only method which outperforms our
non-supervised methods is that of (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007) when based on Wikipedia, prob-
ably because of the dense, manually distilled knowl-
edge contained in Wikipedia. All in all, our super-
vised combination gets the best published results on
this dataset.
7 Conclusions and future work
This paper has presented two state-of-the-art dis-
tributional and WordNet-based similarity measures,
with a study of several parameters, including per-
formance on similarity and relatedness data. We
show that the use of disambiguated glosses allows
for the best published results for WordNet-based
systems on the WordSim353 dataset, mainly due to
the better modeling of relatedness (as opposed to
similarity). Distributional similarities have proven
to be competitive when compared to knowledge-
based methods, with context windows being better
for similarity and bag of words for relatedness. Dis-
tributional similarity was effectively used to cover
out-of-vocabulary items in the WordNet-based mea-
sure providing our best unsupervised results. The
complementarity of our methods was exploited by
a supervised learner, producing the best results so
far for RG and WordSim353. Our results include
confidence values, which, surprisingly, were not in-
cluded in most previous work, and show that many
results over RG and WordSim353 are indistinguish-
able. The algorithm for WordNet-base similarity
and the necessary resources are publicly available8.
This work pioneers cross-lingual extension and
evaluation of both distributional and WordNet-based
measures. We have shown that closely aligned
wordnets provide a natural and effective way to
compute cross-lingual similarity with minor losses.
A simple translation strategy also yields good results
for distributional methods.
