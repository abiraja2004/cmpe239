Ch inese  characters ,  as used  in Ch inese  and Japanese  for  o r -  
thography ,*  bear  inherent  mean ings  as  we l l  as  sound shapes .  Apar t  
f rom these  aspects ,  the graph ic  pat terns  of the characters  a l so  vary  
in complex  ways and they appear  very  d i f fe rent  over  a wide range.  
It is obv ious  to nat ive  users  of these  characters ,  however ,  that  the 
graph ic  pat terns  a re  most ly  composed of d i f fe rent  but f requent ly  
used  subun i ts ,  and regu lar i ty  is observed  in the s t ructures  of char -  
ac ter  pat terns .  Quite f requent ly ,  a character  is c lear ly  composed of 
more  than one character  (with some minor  mod i f i ca t ions  in shape) .  
We can in tu i t i ve ly  ident i fy  some commonly  used  s t rokes  such  as  ver -  
t i ca l  and hor i zonta l  l ines  as  const i tuents  of characters  or  the i r  sub-

* The authors are native Japanese, and we are primarily concerned 
with the Chinese characters used in the contemporary Japanese or- 
thography. There is obvious difference between Chinese and Japa- 
nese in the collection of character patterns used, but difference in 
the structural regularity itself is not apparent and remains to be 
studied.

Format ion  of Units  
A unit is  a separab le  subpar t  of a character .  In our ru le  sys -  
m, it is  represented  by a s t r ing  of a l te rnat ing  s t rokes  and con-  
tenators .  The fo rm generated  in th is  way is an under ly ing  fo rm

.be compounded with some other  unit(s).  
1.1. S t rokes  and Operators  
A set  of s t rokes  is g iven in the S t roke- tab le  (Table 1). Each  
s t roke  is ident i f ied  by a two-p lace  number  ca l led  "s t roke  ident i f ie r ,  " 
and is def ined by a s t roke  representat ion  pat tern .  The f i r s t  numera l  
of the s t roke  ident i f ie r  represents  the c lass  of the s t roke  and the 
second the var ia t ion  with in the c lass .  For  example ,  the s t roke  "21" 
which is the f i r s t  var ia t iona l  s t roke  of c lass - two ,  is def ined by the 
s t roke  pat tern  as shown in Fig.  1.

In th is  representat ion ,  the f i r s t  number  (21) is the s t roke  ident i f ie r ,

not be long  to the same group  as  the fo l low ing  st roke.  The  first 
member  of this se lec ted  pa i r  shal l  be  ca l led  the "predecessor"  of 
the concatenator  and  the second member  the "successor .  " For  ex -  
ample ,  in the s t r ing  in i - representat ion  /21S I IP21C21XI IE I I / ,  the 
concatenator  "C"  operates  on  the four th  s t roke  21 (successor )  and  
the second s t roke  ii (p redecessor )  sk ipp ing  the more  immedia te  
s t roke  21. S imi la r ly~ the last concatenator  E concatenates  the last 
s t roke  ii to 21 ra ther  than  another  ii. 
I. 2. I- Representat ion  vs. S -Representat ion  
A s t r ing  of a l te rnat ing  s t rokes  and  concatenators  wh ich  sha l l  be  
ca l led  " i - representat ion"  (input representat ion)  can  represent  an  
under ly ing  fo rm of a unit. The  unit can  be  ac tua l i zed  as  a character  
shape  through execut ing  some shape-ad jus t ing  ru les  and  look ing  up  
the s t roke  table that s to res  the s t roke  representat ion  pat terns  for  
all s t rokes .  For  example ,  the above  ment ioned  s t r ing  that represents  
a s imp le -un i t  character  ~ is ac tua l i zed  as  shown in F ig.  2. 
The  generated  pat tern  can  be  represented  by  g iv ing  the x and  y 
coord inate  va lues  of the th ree  funct iona l  po ints  be long ing  to all the 
const i tuent  s t rokes .  For  the example  above ,  the s t roke  pos i t ions

funct ional  in ter re la t ions  of the const i t -  
uent s t rokes ,  
i. 3. Degeneracy  and  Pseudoconcate -  
nators  
More  than  one  s t roke  can  co inc ide  
in pos i t ion  as spec i f ied  in s - representa -  
t ion on ly  when they are  connected  to 
each  o ther  th rough spec ia l  operators ,  
ca l led pseudoconcatenators .  The  
s t rokes  thus in ter re la ted  are  ca l led 
degenerate  s t rokes .  There  are  two pseudoconcatenators ,  one des ig -  
nated by - (hyphen) and the o ther  by ~ (zero).~'.-" A pseudoconcatenator  
a lways  se lec ts  i ts  neares t  p reced ing  and the next fo l lowing s t rokes  
as the predecessor  and the successor ,  respect ive ly ,  and these  
s t rokes  must  be long to the same s t roke-c lass .  Any degenerate  
s t rokes  must  be concatenated  (or compounded by a superconcatenator ,  
see  infr,._._.a) to a s t roke  of the oppos i te  group at the la t te r ' s  p, in 
s - representat ion. : ' , - ' *  A s t r ing  in i - representat ion  that does not meet  
these  cond i t ions  is b locked in generat ion  and thus is re jec ted  as a 
representat ion  of a unit. 
The pseudoconcatenators  al lot the same pos i t ion  (in te rms of 
the i r  },t (and often a l so  ~ and u) consequent ly )  coord inates  in s -  
representat ion  to a pa i r  of ident ica l  or  s imi la r  s t rokes .  The de-  
generate  s t rokes  in s - representat ion  are  marked  for  the hyphen or  
the zero .  The order  of s t roke  occur rences  is genera l ly  p reserved  
in s - representat ion .  Degeneracy  of more  than two s t rokes  are  not 
a l lowed.  In the ac tua l i za t ion  process ,  as d i scussed  la ter ,  degener -  
acy c reated  by the hyphen is reso lved  and the degenerate  s t rokes  
~',-" In ear l ie r  repor ts  of our  study,  we  assumed the hyphen and  a com-  
ma as pseudoconcatenators .  The  rule sys tem is rev ised  here.  
** There  are  some fur ther  res t r i c t ions  about  the k ind  of s t rokes  to 
be  degenerate  and  those  to be  concatenated  to degenerate  s t rokes ,  
and  a lso  about  combinat ion  of these.  Subc lass i f iea t ion  of s t rokes  in 
this respect  is still to be  studied.

(degenerate  vs. reso lved)  
In the case of the zero,  the strokes 
are separated in the same manner ,  but 
at the same t ime a specia l  stroke of the 
opposite c lass (horizontal l ine for c lass-  
2 degenerate strokes and ver t i ca l  l ine 
for c lass-1 degenerate strokes) is auto- 
mat ica l ly  introduced in s - representat ion .  
Th is  add i t iona l  s t roke  has  an  "infinitesi- 
ma l  length,  " and  this b r idges  the pert i -  
nent  two  (degenerate)  s t rokes .  Where  
this b r idge  shou ld  be  p laced  a long  the 
degenerate  s t rokes  is determined ,  after 
the unit has  been  completed  in s - repre -  
sentat ion,  accord ing  to a pre ference  
order  that is g iven  by  convent ion  of this 
rule sys tem.  The  pre ference  order  for 
the se lec ted  point on  the degenerate  
s t rokes  is Oh, c~ ? and  ~ , but if a par -  
t icular point shows  co inc idence  w i th  any  
o ther  stroke(s) ,  i. e. , when the point is 
used  as a junct ion  in the pat tern ,  this 
point is avo ided  and  the point w i th  the 
next  degree  of p re ference  is se lec ted  
for p lac ing  the in f in i tes ima l  stroke.  The  
in f in i tes imal  s t roke  becomes  "s t re tched"  
when the degenerate  s t rokes  separate ,  
g iv ing  an actua l  b r idg ing  between them.  
The  in f in i tes imal  s t roke  can  be  p laced  
on ly  at a point where  the funct iona l  
points  (of the same kind) of the degener -  
ate s t rokes  co inc ide.  
The  zero  can  be  used  repeated ly  in the same space  between a 
pa i r  of (degenerate)  s t rokes  in i - representat ion .  Each  symbo l  of 
zero inserts an infinitesimal stroke at the place of the highest prefer- 
ence that remains available. Examples for the use of degenerate 
strokes and the pseudoeoncatenators are given in Fig. 3. 
i. 4. The  Dummy Concatenator  "?"  
A eoncatenator  in genera l  concatenates  a s t roke  wi th  another  
stroke.  We in t roduce  a dummy concatenator  "? ,  " so that we  may 
concatenate  a s t r ing w i th  another  string. The  "?"  in i - representa -  
t ion marks  its immediate ly  p reced ing  s t roke  as the predecessor  of 
a eoncatenator  that remains  to be  spec i f ied later in the str ing in con-  
junct ion  w i th  the se lec ted  successor  stroke.  In the str ing fo l lowing  
this dummy concatenator ,  an  ext raneous  concatenator  must  be found 
consecut ive ly  fo l lowing another  eoneatenator  wi thout  a s t roke  identi- 
f ier in between,  and  the second concatenator  in the sequence  se lects  
the s t roke  marked  prev ious ly  by  "?"  as its p redecessor  stroke.  The  
fo l low ing  s t roke  serves  as  the successor  for  both  of the concatenators  
in pair ,  thus spec i fy ing  a junct ion  of two  str ings. For  example ,  in 
the ease  of a unii represented  by  /21Cl  7?21SE I IP21T I I /  (Fig. 4-e), 
the pat tern  /21C17/  (Fig. 4 -a )  is abut ted  to the second pat tern  /21S 
I IP21T I I /  (Fig. 4-b)  th rough the concatenator  E operat ing  on  the 
s t roke  21 of the fo rmer  and  I I  of the latter. Th is  operator  "?"  is 
conven ient  to fo rm a unit accord ing  to the s t roke  order  in the tradi- 
t ional  handwr i t ing .

The  example  above  cou ld  be generated  by  a str ing /21C17E I IS  
21P21T I I /  if only  we d is regard  the tradition. Somet imes ,  however ,  
the use  of "?"  is necessary  for generat ing  exist ing characters .  The  
pat tern  of Fig. 5, for example ,  can  be  t ranscr ibed  as /21727PE I IT  
27/ ,  but there  is no  way  to generate  it w i thout  us ing  the dummy con-  
catena~:~L% un less  we defne  a new concatenator  filling in the space  
in the concatenator  table w i th  so - to -speak  a con jugate  concatenator  
(in this case  an E:'.-" that wou ld  select  }i of the predecessor  and  cJ of 
the successor  for co inc idence) .  In t roduct ion  of these  con jugate  con-  
catenators  is not des i rab le  in cons iderat ion  of the genera l i za t ion  of 
the ru le  sys tem,  because  it expands  the set of i - representat ions  
cons iderab ly  w i thout  resu l t ing  in any  addi t iona l  acceptab le  patterns.

The  par t i cu la r  s ide  of  the  d iagona l  in

I. 5. Rest r i c t ions  on  S -Representa -  
t ions  
Some res t r i c t ions  in  te rms  of the  
generated  s - representat ion  have  been  
s ta ted  in connect ion  w i th  the  degener -  
acy  and  the  in f in i tes ima l  s t roke .  There  
a re  some more  res t r i c t ions  of  a gener -  
al  k ind  g iven  in te rms  of  the  der ived  s-  
representat ion .  These  res t r i c t ions  
may be  in terpreted  as  f i l te r ing  func -  
t ions  of  the  t rans format iona l  p rocess  
of  ac tua l i za t ion  ( see  ~ 3). 
One  ra ther  obv ious  res t r i c t ion  is that  no  s t rokes  of  the  same 
c lass  except  degenerate  ones  can  share  the  same set  o f  coord inate  
va lues  fo r  any  members  of  the i r  funct iona l  po in ts ,  whether  they  both  
a re  of  the  same k ind  ( 06 , ~ ,  o r  ~)  o r  d i f ferent .  The  convent ion  of  
concatenat ion  w i th  the  not ion  of  aff inity e l im inates  the  poss ib i l i ty  of  
generat ing  two  such  s t rokes  as  a resu l t  of  immedia te  success ion  of  
these  in i - representat ion .  A s t r ing ,  fo r  example ,  l ike  / I IC21S I I / ,  
however ,  is permiss ib le  in i - representat ion  but  must  be  re jec ted  by  
the  c r i te r ion  s ta ted  above .  
Another  poss ib le  res t r i c t ion  that  may be  imposed  on  an  s - repre -  
sentat ion  of  a uni t  is in te rms  of the  ra t io  of  the  la rgest  d imens ion  of  
the  generated  pat tern  to the  number  of s t rokes  ut i l ized.  A th resho ld  
may be  set  and  a pat te rn  w i th  a la rger  va lue  of  th is  ra t io  may be  re -  
jec ted ,  by  use  of an  appropr ia te  de f in i t ion  of  length  across  a unit. 
Th i s  wou ld  exc lude  a long  z ig -zag  of a l te rnat ing  i i  and  21, fo r  ex -  
ample ,  frorn the set of acceptable characters. 
A restriction of a more  essential kind is probably in regard to 
the selection of a particular variation on the basis of contextual re- 
dundancy. It may  well be the case that this kind of restriction ~is so 
strong that we  can totally omit spccit'ying the variation numbers  of 
the strokes for the input transcription of any character. These  
points remain  to be investigated. 
2. Compound ing  of  Un i t s  
More  than one unit can be compounded to fom-n a complex  unit, 
which in turn as a unit can be compoui ided with ~nother unit. The  
derivation of a character  by a sequence of compound ing  can be 
represented  in i - representat ion  by  recurs ive  use  of pa i r s  of paren-  
theses ,  each  sur round ing  a subst r ing  as  a unit, A more  i l lustrat ive 
representat ion  may be  g iven  in a fo rm of t ree  d iagram,  where  the 
type  of compound ing  is g iven  by  the compounder  symbo l  at each  node  
(see F ig .  6). For  a unit to make  a subpar t  of a character ,  it is

2. I. Compounders  
The  compounder  "H"  can  ar range  more  than  one  unit in a hor i -  
zonta l  row,  and  the "V"  can  ar range  some vert ical ly.  These  two

degenerate  group  of s t rokes  e i ther  
hor i zonta l  or  vert ical .  For  example ,  
in the unit (21S I IC I IP I IT21)  X (21), 
the compounded unit {21S I IC I IP I IT21)  
cou ld  be  regarded  as  a c lass - I  s t roke,  
In this in terpretat ion ,  it can  be  sa id  
that the superconeatenator  in effect 
acts  as a concatenator  of the same symbo l .  In a case  l ike the unit 
(II) X (21C37S47) ,  the pat tern  actual ly  can  be  represented  by  a s ing le  
unit I IX21C37S47,  s imp ly  by  remov ing  the parentheses .  
We may in t roduce  another  superconcatenator  D,  wh ich  is de f ined  
as  a combinat ion  of C and  E, namely  a compounder  that superposes  
a s t roke  wh ich  is "s t re tched"  in such  a way  that both  ends  co inc ide  
w i th  the two  s t rokes  at the ext reme pos i t ions  in the compounded unit.

3. Ac tua l i za t ion  
A character  is t ranscr ibed  as a set  of units combined  through 
compounders  in any depth of complex i ty .  Each const i tuent  unit is 
t ranscr ibed  as a s t r ing  in i - representat ion  p laced  in parentheses .  
The i - representat ions  of units determine  the i r  s - representat ions ,  
spec i fy ing  pos i t ion ing  of all occur rences  of s t rokes  in a f rame of the 
pat tern  field. The  franle is normal i zed  and  p laced  together  accord -  
ing to the spec i f i ca t ion  of the compounder  to fo rm a compound unit, 
and  this p rocess  of normal i za t ion  and  abutt ing can  be  recurs ive ly  re-  
peated.  The  set of ru les  for  normal i za t ion  and  s t roke  reduct ion  (see 
supra}  is thus  cyc l ic  in the sense  of the cycl ic i ty of phono log ica l  
rules.  The  s - representat ion  for a unit after the normal i za t ion  no  
longer  has  the quant i zed  coord inates .  In the last s tage  of actua l i za -  
tion of a character .  S t rokes  shapes  are  ca l led in fo rm the s t roke  
representat ion  pat tern  into this genera l i zed  s - representat ion .  
3. I. S t roke  Ar rangement  
It may  be  obv ious  intuit ively that in the ac tua l i zed  fo rm of any  
14 
character  the const i tuent  s t rokes  are  d i s t r ibuted  in space  somehow 
evenly.  Th is  fact  can be accounted  fo r  by des ign ing  a la ter  par t  of 
the ac tua l i za t ion  process  to fo rm a set  of s t roke  d i s t r ibut ion  ru les .  
As a genera l  p r inc ip le  for  th is  d i s t r ibut ion  of s t rokes  in space ,  we 
may assume a potent ia l  f ie ld def ined in the s t roke  pat tern  of each  
s t roke  sur round ing  the ac tua l i zed  shape  of the s t roke .  We then may 
hypothes ize  that superpos i t ion  of the potent ia l s  be long ing  to the d is -  
t r ibuted  s t rokes  in the f inal ly  ac tua l i zed  pat tern  resu l t s  in a s tate  of 
equ i l ib r ium by at ta in ing  the tota l  potent ia l  energy  min imum.  In 
shor t ,  s t rokes  exer t  repu ls ive  fo rce  aga ins t  each  o ther ,  and the 
s t rokes  can t rans la te  and be compressed  with in a g iven unit f rame 
as long as the topo log ica l  in terconnect ions  a re  not changed.  The 
end points  ~ and u9 are  a lways  r ig id ly  re la ted  to the ac tua l i zed  
s t roke  shape ,  but the midpo in t  \]_~ can shi f t  a long the l ine def ined 
typ ica l ly  as a s t ra ight  l ine connect ing  (Z and uJ . 
3. 2. P rac t i ca l  Approx imat ion  
A pract i ca l  approx imat ion  for  th is  p r inc ip le  of d i s t r ibut ion  may 
be dev ised  as  fo l lows.  Each s t roke  has a two-d imens iona l  measure  
of spac ia l  occupancy  for  x and y d i rec t ions ,  def ined in a s t roke  table.  
A "s i ze  normal i za t ion  fac tor "  of a unit is  def ined as the sum of these  
measures  of occupancy  of al l  the const i tuent  s t rokes .  The area  
which is occup ied  by each const i tuent  unit in a complex  unit is  deter -  
mined  by the propor t ion  in te rms of the "s i ze  factor .  " 
Within a unit,  the ac tua l i zed  d i s t r ibut ion  of const i tuent  s t rokes  
is at ta ined in a s imi la r  manner ,  by a l lowing typ ica l ly  equal  spaces  
between s imi la r  s t rokes  in the d i rec t ion  perpend icu la r  to the s t roke  
l ine. An equal ly  we ighted space  is a l lowed at the marg in  between 
the border  of the f rame and the outermost  s t roke .  There  are  some 
deta i l s  of the ru les  which wi l l  not be d i scussed  here .  
Some examples  of characters  a re  i l l us t ra ted  in F ig.  15. These  
were  actua l ly  generated  on an osc i l l oscope  d isp lay  of a computer  by 
typing in the i - representat ions .  The ru les  used for  th is  p ract i ca l  
approx imat ion  of the ac tua l i za t ion  process  a rc  only pre l iminary  and 
some character  pat terns  suggest  necessary  cor rec t ions  of the pro -  
g ram which can be most ly  read i ly  done. 
4. Conc lud ing  Remarks  
Many  detai ls  a re  still to be  worked  out and  some are  s imp ly  not 
descr ibed  here  for brevity.  It is obv ious ly  t rue  that the same char -  
ac ter  can  be  generated  by  di f ferent i - representat ions ,  par t ly  due  to 
di f ferent s t roke  orders  and  par t ly  due  to d i f ferent  se lec t ion  of var ia -

some spec ia l  cases  depend ing  
on  whether  a compounder  or  a 
coneatenator  is used ,  as  men-  
t ioned in 2. I. The  use  of 
degeneracy  aga ins t  compound-  
ing g ives  still another  sort  of 
ambigu i ty .  Thus  for example ,  
the character  can  be  gener -  
a ted e i ther  as a s imp le  unit 
/ I I~ I IX21/  or  as  a compounded 
fo rm /(21SI IP21T I  \] )X(21)/. 
These  sor ts  of ambigu i ty  
have  been  to a la rge  extent  e l im-  
inated by  some care  taken  in 
fo rmulat ing  the rule sys tem,  
but some of them are  interest -  
ing and  seem to ind icate the 
inherent  p rob lems concern ing  
the nature  of Ch inese  characters .  
The  sys tem we have  g iven  here  
is concrete  and  val id in fair de-  
tails, but it is still sub ject  to 
even  major  changes  for impr 'ove-  
ment .  The  essent ia l  pr inc ip le ,  
however ,  seems to us conv inc -  
ingly ef fect ive for descr ip t ion  
of the graph ica l  s t ruc tures  of 
the characters .

SUMMARY 
A sys tem is p roposed  for  spec i fy ing  any one of the accepted  
pat terns  of Ch inese  characters ,  or  s imi la r  pat terns  that could be 
used as  Ch inese  characters .  The sys tem may be cons idered  as a 
generat ive  grammar  of the set  of character  pat terns .  A unit is  
fo rmed by concatenat ing  s t rokes  by operators .  A set  of s t rokes  is 
given in a s t roke  table  where  three  abst rac t  funct iona l  po ints  ~ , 
, ,u ,  t~ , as  wel l  as a typ ica l  ac tua l i za t ion  fo rm,  a re  def ined for  
each s t roke .  Concatenators  and pseudoconcatenators  a re  prov ided ,  
each of them def in ing a par t i cu la r  pos i t iona l  in ter re la t ion  between 
two s t rokes  in te rms of co inc idence  of the funct iona l  points .  The 
set  of s t rokes  is d iv ided into two funct iona l ly  d is t inc t  g roups ,  and 
a concatenator  can combine  only a pa i r  of s t rokes  of d i f fe rent  g roups ,  
a pseudoconcatenator  only those  of the same group. Thus a s t r ing  of 
a l te rnat ing  s t rokes  and operators ,  which may be ca l led  the " i - repre -  
sentat ion ,  " determines  an under ly ing  fo rm of a unit ,  which can be 
ac tua l i zed  as a character  shape through looking up the s t roke  table  
and execut ing  some shape-ad jus t ing  ru les .  On the leve l  of i - repre -  
sentat ion ,  more  than one unit can be combined  to fo rm a more  com-  
plex character  pat tern ,  by use of one or  more  of compound ing  oper -  
a tors  that spec i fy  " t rans format iona l  p rocesses"  to be executed  be-  
fo re  the shape  ad jus tment  process .  P re l iminary  resu l t s  of an on- 
l ine computer  exper iment  wi l l  be shown where  the ac tua l i za t ions  of 
characters  a re  d i sp layed  on an osc i l l oscope  when characters  a re  
spec i f ied  by typing in the i - representat ions .
