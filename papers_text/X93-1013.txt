1. TASKS 
The information extraction tasks for the ARPA TIP- 
STER program center on automatically filling object-ori- 
ented data structures, called templates, with information 
extracted from free text in news stories (for discussion of 
templates and objects, see "Template Design for Informa- 
tion Extraction" in this volume). With text as input, the 
TIPSTER systems first detect whether the text contains rel- 
evant information. If so, the systems extract specific 
instances of generic types of information that correspond to 
each slot in the template and output hat information by fill- 
ing the template slots in an appropriate data representation. 
These slots are then scored by using an automatic scoring 
program with templates produced by human analysts that 
serve as answer keys. Human analysts also prepared evel- 
opment set templates for each domain, which served as 
training models for system developers (for discussion of 
the data preparation effort, see "Corpora nd Data Prepara- 
tion for Information Extraction" in this volume). 
With the TIPSTER program goal of demonstrating 
domain and language-independent algorithms, extraction 
tasks for two domains (joint ventures and microelectronics 
chip fabrication) for both English and Japanese were identi- 
fied. The selection criteria for this pair of languages 
included linguistic diversity, availability of on-line 
resources, and availability of computer support resources. 
The four pairs include EJV, JJV, EME, and JME, abbrevi- 
ated to reflect he language (E or J) and the domain (JV or 
ME). The tasks, domains and languages used for the infor- 
marion extraction portion of the TIPSTER program were 
also used for the Fifth Message Understanding Conference 
(MUC-5). In MUC-5, non-TIPSTER participants could 
choose to perform in one of the domains in Japanese and/or 
English. Of the TIPSTER participants, three performed in 
all four pairs, and the fourth in both domains but only in 
English. 
2. THE JO INT  VENTURE DOMAIN 
The reporting task for the domain of Joint Ventures 
involves capturing information about business activities of 
entities (companies, governments, individuals, or other 
organizations) who enter into a cooperative agreement for a 
specific project or purpose. The partnership formed 
between these ntities may or may not result in the creation 
of a separate joint venture company to carry out the activi- 
ties of the agreement. In many cases, a looser cooperative 
arrangement between partner entities (called a 'tie up') is 
established; information about fie ups is also captured as 
part of the JV task. A tie up may involve joint product 
development, market share arrangements, technology 
transfer, etc. The terms 'tie up' and 'joint venture' are 
sometimes used interchangeably in describing the Joint 
Venture domain. In addition to reporting information about 
new joint ventures, the JV task also involves capturing 
information from reports of the activity of existing joint 
ventures or about changes in any joint venture agreements. 
In other words, any discussion of joint ventures in any 
news article is to be reported, so long as enough informa- 
tion is presented to meet he minimal reporting conditions, 
namely, that at least wo entities are involved in a two-way 
discussion about forming a joint venture, or have entered 
into such an agreement, and that at least one piece of iden- 
tifying information is known about each involved entity, 
such as its name, nationality, or location. 
The JV template consists of eleven different object 
types, which together capture ssential information about 
joint venture formation and activities (the canonical who, 
what, where, when, and why). The TIE-UP-RELATION-  
SHIP object captures the most basic information about a 
tie up or joint venture discussed in a particular document, 
including who the tie-up partner ENTITYs are, and who 
the joint venture (or "child") company is, if one is formed. 
Additionally, for the TIE-UP-RELATIONSHIP,  the 
STATUS of the joint venture is recorded, along with infor- 
mation about OWNERSHIP  and ACTIVITYs associated 
with the tie up. The ACTIVITY involves information

about what the joint venture will be doing, including what 
INDUSTRYS the tie up will be involved in, where the 
activity will take place, when it will start and end, and how 
much REVENUE is expected from the venture. The 
INDUSTRY of the joint venture is captured in categorical 
terms (MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH, SALES, etc.), 
and also coded as one or more Standard Industrial Classifi- 
cation categories (see Section 4 below) linked with the 
specific words in the text that define the business. 
Figure 1 illustrates the object ypes and the interrela- 
tions among them in the Joint Ventures domain. Note that 
multiple interrelations may be represented by one arrow; 
for example, the T IE -UP-RELAT IONSHIP  object has 
two possible interrelationships with ENTITY objects, i.e., 
either identification ofthe parents in a tie up, or identifica- 
tion of the joint venture child company itself. The relative 
complexity of the template design mirrors the intricacies 
inherent in the tie-up event itself. 
Appendix A gives a straightforward example from the 
English Joint Venture domain, including an excerpt from an 
EJV article, along with its corresponding filled-out em- 
plate. There is one tie up in this article, triggered by the 
announcement that "Bridgestone Sports Co .... has set up a 
joint venture in Taiwan." This tie up has three parent or 
partner companies CBridgestone Sports Co.," "Union Pre- 
cision Casting Co.," and "Taga Co.") and a child company 
("Bridgestone Sports Taiwan Co.") that will be engaged in 
the production of golf clubs. Although there is only one 
TIE-UP in this article, multiple tie ups in a single article 
are common in the English and Japanese corpora. In the 
diagram in Figure 3, note the different labels on the ares; 
e.g., the TIE-UP-RELATIONSHIP has two types of arcs 
pointing to ENTITYs, reflecting the two types of interrela- 
tionships discussed above, namely, "parent company" and 
"joint venture child company." 
In Appendix C, an example is given from the Japanese 
124 
Joint Venture domain. The excerpted article references a 
new activity about o get underway in the financial arena, 
namely, issuing of a new credit card. This new product is 
the result of a recent ie up between "Daimaru" and "six 
companies of the VISA Card Group, including "Sumitomo 
Credit Service." In accordance with the JJV fill rules (see 
"Corpora nd Data Preparation for Information Extraction" 
in this volume), the tie up is instantiated between Daimaru 
and Sumitomo Credit Service, which is regarded as the 
group leader for the VISA Card Group, because it is the 
only group member explicitly mentioned in the text. The 
template indicates a single ACTIVITY, with an INDUS- 
TRY type FINANCE, and product/service string "issuing 
the Daimaru Excel VISA card." 
3. THE MICROELECTRONICS DOMAIN 
The reporting task in the domain of Microelectronics 
involves capturing information about advances in four 
types of chip fabrication processing technologies: layering, 
lithography, etching, and packaging. For each process, this 
information relates to process-specific parameters that typ- 
ify advancements. For example, the introduction of a new 
type of film used in layering (that is, adding material to the 
substrate of a chip) or an increase in the resolution possible 
in lithography both indicate new developments in fabrica- 
tion technology. To be reported, each process must be asso- 
ciated with some identifiable ntity that is manufacturing, 
selling, or distributing equipment, or developing or using 
processing technology. 
The MICROELECTRONICS-CAPABIL ITY  template 
object links together information about he four fabrication 
technologies (LITHOGRAPHY, LAYERING, PACKAGING, 
and ETCHING) with the ENTITYS, typically companies, 
associated with one of the technologies as its DEVELOPER, 
MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR, or PURCHASER_-  
USER. Additionally, the template captures information 
about he specific EQUIPMENT used, developed, or sold, as 
well as information about the type of chips or DEVICEs 
that are expected to be produced by that technology. There 
are nine objects in the domain. 
Figure 2 illustrates the object types captured in the 
Microelectronics template. Appendix B provides an exam- 
ple from the Microelectronics domain, including an excerpt 
from an EME article, along with its corresponding filled- 
out template. There are two microelectronic capabilities in 
this example. The first capability is succinctly represented 
in the first sentence with the identification of a lithography 
process ("a new stepper") associated with an entity ("Nikon 
Corp.") as the manufacturer and distributor ("to market") of 
a piece of equipment that implements a lithographic pro- 
cess. Note also that the technology will be used to produce 
a device ("64-Mbit DRAMs"), which satisfies the reporting 
condition requirement for technology connection to inte- 
grated circuit production. Additional information about he 
process and equipment occurs in the text. The second capa- 
bility stems from information in the second sentence (i.e., 
"compared to the 0.5 micron of the company's latest step- 
per"). The need to interpret this segment within the context 
of the discourse demonstrates the level of text understand- 
ing required in this domain. 
4. DOMAIN D IFFERENCES 
The JV and ME domains differ in the focus of their 
task, type of complexity, and level of technicality. The focus 
of the JV task is the tie-up formation and the corresponding 
activities of the resulting agreement. Thus, to a large extent, 
the task is event-driven. The information to be extracted 
includes the participants in the event, the economic activity 
of the event, and adjunct information about he event, such 
as time, facilities, revenue, and ownership. Entities are cen- 
tral, specifically within the context of the tie-up relation- 
ship. In addition, relationships also dominate in that the tie- 
up event presents a cohesive collection of linked objects, 
e.g., persons and facilities linked to entities, entities linked 
to other entities, industries linked to activities, and so on. 
The overarching task is fitting together the interrelated 
pieces of the single tie-up event. 
The focus of the ME task is the four microelectronics 
chip fabrication processes and their attributes. The task is 
not triggered by a particular event, as in JV; the focus is on 
more static information. The information to be extracted 
includes the processes with their attributes and associated 
devices and pieces of equipment. Processes are central in 
ME, whereas entities are in some sense auxiliary. Although 
clearly the information about processes must be associated 
with an entity to be relevant, he task design centers on the 
processes themselves and their attributes. Essentially, the 
domain fractures into four separate sub-tasks, one for each 
process. Linking attributes to a process, like film or temper- 
ature to the layering process, involves defining the process 
in terms of key characteristics nherent in the process itself. 
Both devices and pieces of equipment are also associated 
with processes, but in quite different and indirect ways. 
Equipment represents the implementation of a process, 
whereas devices represent the application of a process. No 
single overarching task applies for the ME domain; rather, 
there are four separate, concurrent subtasks in which associ- 
ated characteristics of processes are identified. 
The two domains also differ in the nature of their com- 
plexity. The complexity of the JV domain lies not in the pre- 
dominance of technical jargon but in the intricacies of the 
interrelationships within a tie-up event. These intricacies 
125

Figure 2: Microelectronics template object ypes (and pointers) 
cover a broad range of activities that legitimately fall within 
the domain of joint business ventures. Since there is no sin- 
gle way to create a business relationship of the sort cap- 
tured in this domain, there can be many points at which 
interpretation r judgment comes into play. Although this 
interpretation can be minimized by specification (some- 
times arbitrary) in the frill rules, the open-endedness, and in 
some ways potential for creativity, in how a tie-up is real- 
ized results in domain complexity. For example, determin- 
ing whether or not a text has enough information to warrant 
reporting atie up, or whether there is sufficient evidence for 
a tie-up activity, may require a substantial mount of judg- 
ment on the part of the analyst. Initially, there was a wide 
variation in interpretation f these issues among the JV ana- 
lysts for each language. However, through frequent meet- 
ings, these differences in interpretation were narrowed over 
time, and there was a convergence of viewpoints on what 
information to extract from a given JV document and how 
to represent i in the template. The fill rules were continu- 
ally modified and updated to incorporate the heuristics 
developed by the analysts for determining when a valid tie 
up or activity existed. 
The resolution of coreferences, which also contributes 
to domain complexity, is a key task in the Joint Ventures 
domain. In particular, the entities in the JV documents were 
typically referenced in multiple ways. The EJV example in 
Appendix A illustrates one case where each of the E1vrI- 
TYs is referred to at least hree times in the text, and each of 
those multiple (and differing) references may contribute 
additional information to the ENTITY objects. For exam- 
ple, the phrase "the Japanese sports goods maker" needs to 
be coreferenced with "Bridgestone Sports Co." in order to 
identify the nationality of Bridgestone. Of equal importance 
in the JV domain is event-level coreference determination, 
in other words, determining which joint ventures are unique 
among a set of multiple apparent joint ventures in the text. 
For example, the article~in Appendix A has multiple para- 
graphs, each discussing a joint venture, and event-level 
coreference r solution is required to determine that they are 
126 
all discussing the same joint venture, not four different 
ones. This coreference layering problem at both entity and 
event levels makes extraction difficult in this domain. 
In comparison, the ME domain derives complexity 
not from interrelationships, but from its composition. There 
are four sub-domains, one for each process. Each sub- 
domain corresponds to a process with attributes, two of 
which can be devices or pieces of equipment. In addition, 
entities are associated with these processes in one of four 
different capacities: developer, manufacturer, distributor, or 
purchaser/user. Adding complexity to the ME domain is the 
pre-requisite to connect he technology to integrated chip 
production. 
The third area of domain difference is the level of 
technicality, namely, the extent o which highly technical 
terms and knowledge are used. The JV domain lies within 
the financial/economic area, and the articles are typical of 
general business news. The one element of the JV domain 
that relies more on technical jargon or specific technical 
descriptions i the product or service that the joint venture 
will be involved in. This information, in addition to being 
reported as an exact string fill from the text, also is reported 
in the JV template as a two-digit code, according to the 
Standard Industrial Classification manual of the U. S. 
Office of Management and Budget. These strings may 
involve technical terms; for example, "ignition wiring har- 
ness" is classified under SIC 36, which includes electronic 
and other electrical equipment and components. 
In contrast, the ME domain lies within the scientific 
and technical arena with a corpus composed of product 
announcements and reports on research advances. The texts 
are loaded with domain-specific technical terms, at times 
detailing chip fabrication methodology. The fill rules pro- 
vide a resource for this technical terminology, which essen- 
tially provides hooks into the text for extracted information. 
These hooks mean that in the pre-processing stage, some of 
the extracted information can be identified as discrete 
tagged elements and then confirmed for extraction i  later 
stages of processing. This "bias for keywording" is less- 
ened to some extent by the higher percentage of irrelevant 
documents in the ME corpus than the JV corpus and by two 
requirements in the reporting conditions (i.e., a process 
must be associated with an entity in one of four roles and 
the application for the process must be related to integrated 
circuits). 
5. LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES 
Although the Japanese and English tasks are appar- 
ently identical (other than the language of the texts and 
templates), subtle differences emerge with closer scrutiny 
of the corpora, template definitions, and fill rules (see "Cor- 
pora and Data Preparation for Information Extraction" in 
this volume) for each of the two languages. The corpora for 
English and Japanese differ, in that the two English corpora 
are drawn from more than 200 sources each, and have a 
fairly low percentage of irrelevant documents in the set, 
whereas the Japanese corpora have a limited set of sources, 
but a higher percentage of irrelevant documents. 
Over the ,course of the data preparation task, differ- 
ences between the English and Japanese texts were gradu- 
ally identified and strategies for dealing with them were 
incorporated into the fill roles. A major difference between 
texts in the JV domain is the fact that in the JJV corpus, the 
most typical relationship involves two entities joining 
together in a tie up where no joint venture company is cre- 
ated, whereas in EJV, the typical relationship involves one 
in which two entities form a joint venture company as part 
of the agreement. In EJV, texts which were produced by 
Japanese news sources (in English) could also reflect he 
type of tie-up arrangement typical of the Japanese texts, i.e., 
where no joint venture company is formed. 
Differences between Japanese and English are also 
reflected in minor discrepancies in the Japanese and English 
template definitions and more substantial divergences in the 
corresponding fill rules. While every attempt was made to 
keep the template definition for each domain identical 
across languages, there are some differences. Thus, 
although the English and Japanese templates have the same 
objects and slots for each domain, there are cases where the 
content or format of the fills for a particular slot vary from 
one language to the other, reflecting differences in the two 
corpora. 
In the JJV and EJV templates, an example of a content 
difference in fillers is seen in the FACILITY object's 
FACILITY-TYPE slot, which is a set fill for both EIV and 
JJV. However, for EJV the fillers include COMMUNICA- 
TIONS, SITE, FACTORY, FARM, OFFICE, MINE, 
STORE, TRANSPORTATION, UTILITIES, WAREHOUSE, 
and OTHER, whereas in JJV, the fillers are (translated): 
STORE, RESEARCH_INSTITUTE, FACTORY, CENTER, 
OFFICE, TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNICATIONS, 
CULTURE/LEISURE, and OTHER. The fillers were 
defined and selected by the analysts to reflect he types of 
information most commonly found in the corpora. 
A format difference in slot fills between languages (for 
both \]V and ME) is exhibited in the ENTITY object's NAME 
slot, where English requires a normalized form for the 
entity name, based on a standardized list of abbreviations 
for corporate designators, including more familiar ones like 
INC (incorporated) and LTD (limited), as well as some spe- 
127 
cifically used by foreign firms, such as AG (for Aktienge- 
sellschaft - Germany), EC (for Exempt Company -- 
Bahrain), and PERJAN (for Perusuhan Jawatan -- Indone- 
sia). For Japanese, such a list of designators was not avail- 
able, and in the corpus itself, most companies are indicated 
by the ending sha or kaisha, so it was decided that a string 
fill would be more appropriate for this slot filler. 
The JJV fill rules give detailed decision trees for 
determining who the tie-up partners are. This reflects the 
fact that in the JJV corpus, the texts often begin by men- 
tioning a tie up between two groups. For example, the two 
groups might be Mitsubishi Group and Daimler Group, but 
then, ha the second paragraph, one learns that the actual tie 
up is between Mitsubishi Shoji and Dairnler Benz. The JJV 
fill rules explicitly address this type of situation, since it 
occurs frequently in the corpus. The fill rules stipulate that 
in cases of tie ups between groups, the group leaders are to 
be taken as the tie-up partners, if they are mentioned in the 
text. The EJV fill rules address a slighdy different problem, 
namely, of how to represent tie-up partners if the text states 
"Four Malaysian finance firms announced a joint ven- 
ture...," in which case a tie up between two (not four) iden- 
tical partner entities would be created. This situation did not 
typically arise in the JJV corpus. 
As with the JV domain, the two ME corpora highlight 
significant differences. First, there are basically three news 
sources for the JME corpus, the same set of sources as for 
the JJV corpus. The EME corpus, on the other hand, is 
selected from a business and trade database with more than 
200 different sources. Second, the J/VIE corpus (30%) con- 
tains a higher percentage of irrelevant documents than the 
English corpus (20%). Third, even though the relative pro- 
portion of the four process types is similar, there is a dis- 
tinct difference between languages in the type of 
information available for the PACKAGING object. Not only 
is there considerably more information available for all 
PACKAGING slots for English, there is also clear evidence 
that information for the BONDING and UNITSPER_-  
PACKAGE slots is infrequently available in Japanese. 
English texts are also more likely than Japanese texts to 
contain two or more PACKAGING objects, which may par- 
dally explain anecdotal reports that PACKAGING texts 
were considered ifficult to code for the English analysts, 
but easy for the Japanese analyst. 
There are actually no substantive differences reflected 
in the two sets of fill rules for the ME domain. However, 
differences between languages are indicated in the type of 
information available for extraction. For example, some set 
fill choices in the template simply do not occur in Japanese, 
like some of the hierarchical set fill choices for the PACK- 
AGING object's TYPE slot in ME. Also the keywords, 
"gate size" and "feature size" that indicate granularity for 
the LITHOGRAPHY object do not occur in the Japanese 
corpus. Other minor differences are also indicated in the fill 
rules as to how the information is represented in the English 
and Japanese texts. To illustrate, in contrast to the EME fill 
rules, the Japanese fill rules are more likely to fist relevant 
keywords in the text associated with ENTITY roles and to 
identify relevant stereotypic format clues for location infor- 
mation. This approach suggests the greater likelihood of 
identifiable patterns within the Japanese text. Another illus- 
tration of the dissimilarity in information presentation is the 
Japanese inclusion of English within the Japanese text, for 
example in layering or packaging types or in entity names.
