Abstract
The task of Named Entity Recognition
(NER) is to identify in text predefined
units of information such as person names,
organizations and locations. In this work,
we address the problem of NER in Esto-
nian using supervised learning approach.
We explore common issues related to
building a NER system such as the us-
age of language-agnostic and language-
specific features, the representation of
named entity tags, the required corpus size
and the need for linguistic tools. For
system training and evaluation purposes,
we create a gold standard NER corpus.
On this corpus, our CRF-based system
achieves an overall F1-score of 87%.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of
identification of information units in text such as
person names, organizations and locations. It is
an important subtask in many natural language
processing (NLP) applications such as text sum-
marization, information filtering, relation extrac-
tion and question answering. NER has been
extensively studied for widely spoken languages
such as English with the state-of-the-art systems
achieving near-human performance (Marsh and
Perzanowski, 1998), but no research has yet been
done in regards to Estonian.
The main difference of Estonian, a Finno-Ugric
language, compared to English is high morpholog-
ical richness. Estonian is a synthetic language and
has relatively high morpheme-per-word ratio. It
has both agglutinative and fusional (inflective) el-
ements: morphemes can express one or more syn-
tactic categories of the word. Although Estonian is
considered a subject-verb-object (SVO) language,
all phrase permutations are legal and widely used.
These factors make NLP for Estonian particularly
complicated.
In this work, we address the problem of NER in
Estonian using supervised learning approach. We
explore common issues related to building a NER
system such as the usage of language-agnostic and
language-specific features, the representation of
named entity tags, the required corpus size and the
need for linguistic tools.
To train and evaluate our system, we have cre-
ated a gold standard NER corpus of Estonian news
stories, in which we manually annotated occur-
rences of locations, persons and organizations.
Our system, based on Conditional Random Fields,
achieves an overall cross-validation F1-score of
87%, which is compatible with results reported for
similar languages.
Related work. The concept of NER originated
in the 1990s in the course of the Message Under-
standing Conferences (Grishman and Sundheim,
1996), and since then there has been a steady in-
crease in research boosted by evaluation programs
such as CoNLL (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der, 2003) and ACE (ACE, 2005). The earliest
works mainly involved using hand-crafted linguis-
tic rules (Grishman, 1995; Wakao et al, 1996).
Rule-based systems typically achieve high preci-
sion, but suffer low coverage, are laborious to
build and and not easily portable to new text do-
mains (Lin et al, 2003). The current dominant ap-
proach for addressing NER problem is supervised
machine learning (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der, 2003). Such systems generally read a large
annotated corpus and induce disambiguation rules
based on discriminative features. Frequently used
techniques include Hidden Markov Models (Bikel
et al, 1997), Maximum Entropy Models (Bender
et al, 2003) and Linear Chain Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (McCallum and Li, 2003). The down-
side of supervised learning is the need for a large,
78
annotated training corpus.
Recently, some research has been done on NER
for highly inflective and morphologically rich lan-
guages similar to Estonian. Varga and Simon
(2007) report F1-score of 95% for Hungarian in
business news domain using a Maximum Entropy
classifier. Notably, authors state that morpho-
logical preprocessing only slightly improves the
overall performance. Konkol and Konop??k (2011)
also use Maximum Entropy based approach for
NER in Czech achieving 79% F1-score. Pinnis
(2012) reports F-score of 60% and 65% for Lat-
vian and Lithuanian languages respectively us-
ing CRF classifier with morphological preprocess-
ing and some custom refinements. Ku?c?u?k and
others (2009) describe a rule-based NER system
for Turkish language which achieves F1-score of
79%. We observe that the reported results are no-
tably inferior compared to well-studied languages
such as English. This can be explained by the lan-
guage complexity and the lack of required linguis-
tic tools and annotated corpora.
2 The Corpus
Papers on NER for English language commonly
use publicly available named entity tagged corpora
for system development and evaluation (Tjong
Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Chinchor,
1998). As no such resources are available for the
Estonian, we have built our corpus from scratch.
Our corpus consists of 572 news stories published
in the local online newspapers Delfi1 and Pos-
timees2 between 1997 and 2009. Selected articles
cover both local and international news on a range
of topics including politics, economics and sports.
The total size of the corpus is 184,638 tokens.
The raw text was preprocessed using the mor-
phological disambiguator t3mesta (Kaalep and
Vaino, 1998). The processing steps involve tok-
enization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging,
grammatical and morphological analysis. The re-
sulting dataset was then manually name entity
tagged. Due to the limited resources, the cor-
pus was first tagged by one of the authors and
then examined by the other, after which conflicting
cases were resolved. Following the MUC guide-
lines (Chinchor, 1998), we distinguish three types
of entities: person names (PER), locations (LOC)
and organizations (ORG). Words that do not fall

ered by unique entities, starting with the most fre-
quent.
into any of these categories were tagged as other
(O). We assume that named entities do not over-
lap. In case a named entity is contained within
another named entity, only the top-level entity is
annotated. Table 1 and Figure 1 give an overview
of named entity occurrences in the corpus.

Unique 3588 1589 1987 7164
Table 1: Number of named entities in the corpus.
The corpus is organized closely follow-
ing CoNLL03 formatting conventions (Tjong
Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In a data file,
each line corresponds to a word with empty lines
representing sentence boundaries. Each line con-
tains four fields: the word itself, its lemma, its
grammatical attributes3 and its named entity tag.
Named entity tags are encoded using a widely
accepted BIO annotation scheme (Ramshaw and
Marcus, 1995). Figure 2 demonstrates an example
sentence.
The corpus is freely available for research pur-
poses and is accessible at the repository of public
language resources of Tartu University (Laur et al,

3 System Overview
Two important components in the design of a NER
system are features and a learning algorithm. Fea-
tures encode characteristic attributes of words rel-
evant for the classification task. Possible examples
of features are word lemma, part of speech, occur-
rence in some dictionary. The task of a learning
algorithm is to study the features over a large col-
lection of annotated documents and identify rules
that capture entities of a particular type.
3.1 Features
In our system, we have implemented the following
groups of features:
Base-Line Features. This group includes fea-
tures based mostly on the word?s orthog-
raphy: (1) word itself in lowercase; (2)
word prefixes and suffixes of lengths 3-4; (3)
word type: is-capitalized, all-capitalized, is-
number, is-alphanumeric, contains-dash, contains-
apostrophe, contains-digit, contains-dot, contains-
capitalized-letter, is-punctuation-mark; (4) word
parts before and after a dash in case of compound
words; (5) whether the word is first in the sen-
tence.
Morphological Features. These features are
based on information provided by morphological
disambiguator t3mesta: word lemma, POS-tag,
word case, word ending, constituent morphemes.
Dictionary-based Features. We composed a
large dictionary of entities covering common per-
son names and surnames, local and international
organizations and geographical locations. The dic-
tionary contains entities in both Estonian and En-
glish. The lists of Estonian entities were obtained
from multiple public on-line resources. A large
collection of entities in English was downloaded
from the web site of the Illinois Named Entity
Tagger (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). Table 2 gives
an overview of dictionary size and content. The
dictionary covers 21% of the unique entities in
the corpus, out of which 41% are unambiguous,
meaning that the entity matches exactly one cate-
gory in the dictionary.
Collected entities were preprocessed with a
morphological disambiguator t3mesta. Words
were replaced with their lemmas and turned to
lower case. For a dictionary lookup we employed
a leftmost longest match approach.

Common first and second names in English 9348
(Ratinov and Roth, 2009)

International organisations (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) 329
Total 903279
Table 2: Dictionaries and numbers of entries.
WordNet Features. Estonian Wordnet is a
knowledge base containing more than 27000
different concepts (sets of synonymous words)
(Kerner et al, 2010). Wordnet encodes various se-
mantic relationships between the concepts, which
can be used as valuable information in NER tasks.
Based on the lemmas and their part-of-speech,
we used Wordnet relations to encode hyperonymy,
be in a state, belongs to a class and synset id infor-
mation as extra features.
Global features. Global features enable to ag-
gregate context from word?s other occurrences in
the same document (Chieu and Ng, 2003). We im-
plemented global features as described in (Ratinov
and Roth, 2009). For each occurrencew1, . . . , wN
of the word w the set of features c(wi) is gener-
ated: (1) word is capitalized in document at any
position, but the beginning of a sentence; (2) pre-
ceding word is a proper name; (3) following word
is a proper name; (4) preceding word?s presence
in gazetteers; (5) following word?s presence in
gazetteers. Then, a set of features of the word w is
extended with the aggregated context
?N
i=1 c(wi).

3.2 Learning Algorithm
In this work, we use conditional random fields
model (CRFs). CRFs are widely used for the task
of NER due to their sequential nature and ability
to handle a large number of features. Our choice
is also substantiated by our earlier experiments on
Estonian NER, where CRFs have demonstrated
superior performance over a Maximum Entropy
classifier (Tkachenko, 2010). We use CRFs imple-
mented in the Mallet software package (McCal-
lum, 2002).
4 Experiments and Results
In this section, we conduct a number of experi-
ments to investigate the system behavior with re-
spect to different factors.
We assess system performance using standard
precision, recall and F1 measure (Tjong Kim Sang
and De Meulder, 2003). Scores for individual en-
tity types are obtained by averaging results of 10-
fold cross-validation on the full dataset. When
splitting the data, document bounds are taken into
account so that content of a single document fully
falls either into training or test set. In this way,
we minimize terminology transfer between sam-
ples used for training and testing. To summarize
the results of an experiment with a single number,
we report the weighted average of a corresponding
measure over all entity types.
4.1 Named Entity Tag Representation
The choice of NE tag representation scheme has
been shown to have significant effect on NER sys-
tem performance (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). In this
experiment, we set out to determine which scheme
works best for the Estonian language. We consider
two frequently used schemes ? BIO (Ramshaw
and Marcus, 1995) and BILOU. BIO format iden-
tifies each token as either the beginning, inside or
outside of NE. BILOU format additionally distin-
guishes the last token of multi-token NEs as well
as unit-length NEs. Hence, given NEs of three
types (per, loc, org), the BIO scheme will produce
7 and BILOU 13 distinct tags.
Table 3 compares system performance using
BIO and BILOU schemes. BILOU outperforms
BIO in both precision and recall achieving a mod-
est, but statistically significant 0.3 ppt improve-
ment in F1-score. This agrees with related re-
search for the English language (Ratinov and
Roth, 2009). In the following experiments we use

a superior BILOU scheme.

Table 4: System performance using different
groups of features.
Table 4 illustrates system performance using
groups of features introduced in Section 3.1. We
note that for each token we have included fea-
tures from its immediate neighbors in the win-
dow of size 2. Morphological features demon-
strate a major effect, increasing F1-score by 4.8
ppt. Further inclusion of Dictionary, WordNet and
Global features improves F1-score by 1.0, 0.1 and
0.5 ppt respectively. By combining all groups of
features, we achieve an overall F1-score of 87%.
Results for individual types of named entities are
presented in Table 5. It is worth mentioning, that
we have also attempted to do automatic feature se-
lection using ?2-test and by discarding infrequent
features. However, both methods resulted in a sig-
nificant loss of performance.

4.3 Corpus Size
In this experiment, we study our system?s learning
capacity with respect to the amount of the train-
ing material. For this purpose, we repeat a 10-
81
fold cross-validation experiments with an increas-
ing number of documents. In Figure 3, we observe
the steepest gain in performance up to 300 doc-
uments, which further starts to flatten out. This
indicates that our corpus is of an appropriate size
for the task at hand, and that our system design is
feasible.

increasing number of documents in the cross-
validation corpus. Shaded area depicts 95% confi-
dence interval.
4.4 NER without Morphological Analysis
In the previous section, we have shown that ex-
tending the baseline feature set with morpholog-
ical features significantly boosts system perfor-
mance. However, morphological analysis was per-
formed with a commercial tool which may not be
available due to licensing restrictions. It is, there-
fore, interesting to explore system performance
without using such language specific features. In
this experiment, we omit all the features produced
by morphological analyzer. Since we still want to
use dictionary and global features, we need to ad-
dress an issue of word form normalization. For
this purpose, we have built a simple statistical lem-
matizer by analyzing lemmas and their inflected
forms in Estonian Reference Corpus (Kaalep et al,
2010). As a result, we have achieved F1-score of
84.8% ? a 2.2 ppt decrease compared to the best
result (see Table 6).
We conclude that even for highly inflective lan-
guages such as Estonian simple techniques for
lemmatizer P (%) R (%) F1 (%)
custom 86.4 83.3 84.8

word form normalization, such as our lemmatizer,
enable to achieve performance not much inferior
than sophisticated linguistic tools.
5 Conclusions
In this work, we have addressed design challenges
in building a robust NER system for Estonian.
Our experiments indicate that a supervised learn-
ing approach using a rich set of features can effec-
tively handle the complexity of the language. We
demonstrated the importance of the features based
on linguistic information, external knowledge and
context aggregation. We observed that the choice
of tag representation scheme affects system per-
formance with BILOU outperforming a widely
used BIO scheme. We also showed that an accept-
able performance in NER can be achieved with-
out using sophisticated language-specific linguis-
tic tools, such as morphological analyzer. Last, but
not least, we have built a first gold standard cor-
pus for NER in Estonian and made it freely avail-
able for future studies. On this corpus, our sys-
tem achieves an overall cross-validation F1-score
of 87%.
