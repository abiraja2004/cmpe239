Abstract 
This paper reports the progress of the French 
text-to-speech system being developed at AT&T 
Bell Laboratories as part of a larger project for 
multil ingual text-to-speech systems, including lan- 
guages such as Spanish, Italian, German, Rus- 
sian, and Chinese. These systems, based on di- 
phone and triphone concatenation, follow the gen- 
eral framework of the Bell Laboratories English 
TTS system \[?\], \[?\]. This paper provides a de- 
scription of the approach, the current status of the 
French text-to-speech project, and some problems 
particular to French. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper, the new French text-to-sIieech sys- 
tem being developed at AT&T is presented; sev- 
eral steps have been already achieved while others 
are still in progress. First we present a brief' de- 
scription of the phonetic inventory of French, with 
a discussion of the approach used to select and 
segment phonetic units for the system. Methods 
for automatic segmentation, and for the choice of 
diphone and triphone units are presented. Some 
comments on durational and prosodic issues fol- 
low. We conclude with some discnssions on direc- 
tions for fllture improw.'ment, including morpho- 
logical analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and par- 
tial phrasal analysis for the purpose of phrasal 
grouping. 
Phonet ic  Descr ipt ion of 
French 
The French phonetic system consists of 36 
phonemes, including 17 consonants, 16 vowels, 
and 3 semi-vowels. Table 1 shows the different 
phonemes; the IPA column contains the phonemes 
in the standard International Phonetic Alphabi,t; 
the second column ASCII shows the ascii correspon- 
dence of these characters for the text-to-speech 
system, and the third column shows art example 
of the phoneme in a French word.

Table 1: French Phonetic Phonemes 
For the French text-to-speech synthesis ystem 
we use 35 phonemes, consisting of 17 consonants, 
15 vowels (and not 1{3 like in the n,a cohlmn), and 
3 semi-vowels. As shown in Table 1, the fourth 
nasal /de/ has been removed, /07,/ and /g /  being 
represented by the single phoneme /g/ .  The rea- 
sons for this change are that (1) /de/ tends to be 
assimilated to the phoneme/g / ,  and (2) this nasal 
vowel occurs in very few words in French. Thus,

t ion  o f  Car r ie r  Word  
2.1.1 Structure of Diphones 
This section discusses the nature, of the diphone set 
and the manner in which diphones were collected. 
Diphones are structured as \[bllows: 
*V, *C, g*, C*, CV, VC, CO, gV 
where * is a silence, C a consonant, and V a 
vowel. Semi vowels were treated in the same fash- 
ion as consonants. Diphones were recorded fol- 
lowing two (lif\[erent strategies: the first one con- 
sisted of picking existing words from a dictionary 
list. The second consisted of deciding on a neu- 
tral phonetic ontext in using logatornes or non- 
existing words. Logatomes are phonotactiically 
well-formed strings, which do not exist as words 
in the current French language. 
2.1.2 Selection of exist ing words from 
machine-readable d ic t ionary  
A word list was extracted from a subset of the 
Robert French dictionary \[?\] and the pronuncia- 
tion fields were extracted. The dictionary contains 
almost 89,000 entries, of which 85,796 entries con- 
Lain a headword, a phonemic transcription, and a 
part of speech. The remaining entries are prefixes 
and suffixes. The first task consisted of convert- 
ing and mapping the dictionary phonemic symbols 
to the ones adopted in our system (shown in ta- 
ble 1). This was not straightforward since there 
was not always a one-to-one mapping between the 
two sets. For handling symbol mapping, a pro- 
gram was written that converts any set of charac- 
ters to any other set of characters I. The program 
is developed so that characters coded in octal or 
decimal code not only can he translated in either 
code, but also can be input in ascii format for be- 
ing converted 2
Quite often, there was more than one pronunci- 
ation in the phonetic field and the. pattern match- 
ing program chose the pronunciation correspond- 
ing to the one required. Moreover, dictionary pro- 
11 am very grateflfl to Mike Tanenblatt who wrote this 
program and made a succession ofchanges until complete 
flexibility of character conversion was obtained. 
2 This tool allowed the conversion ofdatabases originally 
written on Macintosh, PC, or Unix. Additionally, we used 
it to convert all the French textual databases into latin1 8 
bit encoding format. 
nouneiation fields are often not phonetically line- 
grained enough for acceptable speech output (see 
\[?\] for a discussion on machine-readable dictionar- 
ies in text-to-speech systems). Finally, due to the 
lack of explicit inflectional information for nouns 
and adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of the 
entries were extracted uring dictionary lookup. 
Sirnilarly for verbs, only the infinil;iwd forms were 
used since the dictionary does not list the intleeted 
forms as headwords. A program was written to 
search through the dictionary pronunciation field 
and select the longest word where the phonenm 
pairs would be in mid-syllable position in order to 
avoid the extraction of' phonemes occuring at the 
beginning or end of words. In this way, l, he influ- 
ence of lexicM stress was reduced. The orthog- 
raphy/prommciation pair \[headword_orth, head- 
wordq~)hon\] was extracted and headword_orth was 
placed in a carrier sentence for recording. Out 
of 1225 original phonemic pairs, 874 words wet'{'. 
found with at least one occurence of the pair. Be 
cause 1225 is the number of all phonemic pairs in 
French whether they are allowed or not, it is inter- 
esting to notice that only 874 pairs occur within 
real words in the Robert dictionary. 
2.1.3 Se lect ion  of logatomes  
For the logato.tes, two phonen,es /a /  attd / t /  were 
used to encompass the selected iphone, since they 
appear to be fairly stable from a phonetic-acousLic 
standpoint. In order to balance the alternation of 
vowel and consonant, he words were constructed 
as follows: 
Logatome posit ion 
initial vow. 
initial cons. 
final vow. 
final cons. 
COILS. VOW. 
VOWel (;ons.

"Fable 2: Phonotactic structure of logatomes 
All strings were generated in this way, ewm if 
they were not phonotaeticMly well-formed for iso- 
lated words in the language. Nonetheless, these 
R)rms were generated and used since they were 
necessary for interword phenomena. Approxi- 
mately 1225 words were constructed following the 
ab ow~' model. 
978 
l{.esearchers disagree as to whether to use 
logatomes or real words for synthesis. The ar- 
gmnent for using logatomcs is that it is t)etter 
to collect non-real words so that the diphone ix 
recorded as neutrally as possible and does uot un- 
dergo any real word stress. Those against argue 
thai; the (\[iphone is ov(~r-articulated in a logatome 
environment and that it reduces l,he naturahmss of
the synthesized sl)eech. The choice is more corn 
plex in the sense that it greatly depends on the 
speaker, the articulation, and the comfort in read 
ing the two diff('.rent sets. Given the controversy, 
in the present system, we decided to record the 
l)houemie t)airs in bot;h environments, o thai we 
(:ould choose the best ones,

I)ue to the variability of liquids and semi-vowels, 
synthesis based only on (liphones will uot give 
good results. Indeed, such systems have provcu 
to be insut\[icient. Researchers \[?\] argue l;ha| di- 
\])holle COllcat(?ll~ttion alolle is llOt a(l(2(ltlate or sl/f- 
ticient, particularly for complex transitions. \[?\] 
claims that "Meal diphones with perfect (;oncatc- 
nation would giw~ imperf(~ct results". Complex 
polypho,~es are not equivalent to concatenated all- 
phones. Therefore, louger concatcnativ(~ units are 
necessary. Polyphones are defined by \['/\] as be- 
ing a segmental unit where the initial and linal 
phoneme are not subject to variability, thus, ex- 
cluding liquids and semi-vowels. 
The strategy chosen in the Fre.nch system re- 
lies on some phonetic ge.neralities to build a set of 
tril)honcs. It was decided a to form a (:lass of tri- 
phoues, based on the following transition: I'VC'~ , 
where 1 ) is a phoneme, V a vowel, and Cc a conso 
naut rel)resenl,ative of the ~trticulatory locations, 
i.e. one velar, one dental, and one nasal. The 
set consisted then of 35 phones x 14 vowels x 3 
consonants = t47() triphon(:s. The same method- 
ology used for building the set of (liptlones was 
used for the triphon(~'s. These were inchMe(I in a 
carrier word for the logatomes and extracted from 
the dictionary for the real words. 
Researchers disagree on which criteria are best 
for the selection of triphones; should the selectiou 
rely on phonectic-a<:oustic <widence, or on statisti- 
cal evidence, related to tl,e fi'equency of occurrence 
of triphones in the language? Then, once the (:rite- 
ria is defined, which triphones houhl be selected? 
Can candidates of a class (say the phoneme /p /  
3 personal communication with Joe Olive 
representing all the stops, the phoneme./v/  repre- 
seutmg all the fficatiw~s) be picked to rel)resent a
class or sit(mid all the phonemes belonging to the 
class he sekwted? Resenreh is underway in this 
a,~a using a phone, , ,  clustering approach \[':\], \[':\] 
that allows the sehx:tion of segnwaltal units fi'om a 
database of I)honemes containing several instances 
of the same phoneme. Tim extraction is made at 
a spectral point common to the pho,wmes. Fi- 
nally, he.cause the nnml)er of selected units atfects 
results, the choi('e of polyphones must be Ilia(h! 
with care. 'l'aking illto accotlrlt the size limita 
lion, one has to balanc(~ out the choice of the poly 
phones considering its frequency in ~he. language. 
This brings in the additional complexity of cort)us 
selection (its language properties, dialects, socio 
linguisl,ic tyl)e of language, topic, and size). 
\[?\] applies a series of rules on phoneum coln- 
bination to exclude inter-word concatenation that 
would not occur in French. For example, one can- 
not lind a glide, in I'~rench that ix not in the left 
or right cont;ext of a vowel; therefore, the combi- 
nation consonant-glide-consonant is excluded. An 
optimal set of polyphone combinations is com- 
puted that re.aches a tmmber of 7725 units. Calcu- 
lated from texts, statistics are then run on these 
illlits to (teterlllille the most freqllellt oc(;iH'elH;es 
in French, and the numbex of units is lowered to 
3000, It remains to be seen whether this al)proacll 
is successfidl iu a workiug system. 
2.3  Construct ion of  the  corpus  
A carrier sentence "C'est CAI~I~ItgI~_WOnl) qlle JC 
dis" was selected to fulfill the following require 
i'qeill.s: 
? short sentelice~ to record, 
? ability t() surrourid the' carrier word to avoid 
selfl, ential accent and effects, 
? phonetically neutral environment. 
2 .4  Cho ice  o f  a Speaker  
l?ive male natiw: speakers of Continental French 
were interviewed for selc'cting tile voice of the 
lq'eneh synthesizer. A sample of text represent- 
ing highly o('(;uring graphemic trigrams wax pre- 
pare.d to be used in this task. The corpus wax 
run through a greedy algorithm 4 that returned 
the most frequent words within their sentences 
4'|'hanks to .Inn Van Santen for developing and running 
his greedy algorithm. 
979 
along with a measure corresponding to the cov- 
erage of the graphemic triphone. Once tile sample 
was recorded by tire 5 speakers, the natural voices 
were run through LPC analysis and re-synthesize.d 
in order to judge the resistance of tile voice to 
synthesis. Five subjects were asked to give their 
judgcrnent on the following criteria: 
clear articulation: tile voice was carefully 
listened to evaluate tire articulation of the 
speaker. Subjective perceptual judgements 
were lnade. 
2. neutral French accent: the candidate was 
asked about tile areas of Franc(: where he 
grew up. The central area of France "l'Ile de 
France" is known for its neutral accent and is 
regarded as being a well-received accent. Ad- 
ditionally, for French native speakers resid- 
ing in the USA, particular attention was paid 
to the influence of English in tire prommcia- 
lion of French, especially for English borrow- 
ings, such as for example, the company name 
AT&T to be pronounced/a  te re / ( the  French 
way) and not; /el t n t/ as in English. 
regularity: special attention was given to en- 
sure that the speaker would have a reason- 
able degree of regularity in uttering French 
phonemes. 
ph:asantness of the voic(.': the subjects doing 
the evaluation were asked to give their opinion 
on the pleasantness of the voice, in particular 
the timber, the level of nasality, and the into- 
nation. Of course, this is a highly subjective 
matter but a critical one for success. 
2.5 Recording Conditions 
The recording was done on four non-consecutive 
days under the following conditions. Thc sen 
tences were recorded directly onto the com- 
puter through a 1)AT (Digital audio 'rape) tape 
recorder, using interactive software allowing easy 
reading and repetition of the sentences Lo be 
recorded. Additional t ime was devoted to the 
recording of triphones as well as the re-recording of 
sentences that were improperly uttered. The same 
carrier sentence and a regular prosodic context 
was carefully maintained so that  there was mini- 
real suprasegmental variation. Once the recording 
was done, the 48 kHz digitized acoustic signal was 
downsized to 12 kllz. 
2.6 Transcr ip t ion  of  record ing  lna- 
ter ial  
For the recording, all sentences were transcribed 
from the phonetic alphabet to an orthographic 
Ibrrnat. This was done to allow tile speaker 
to utter sent(;nees with more naturalness. Once 
the  record ing  was dorlc'~ th(" sentences  were setni-  
automatically re-transcribed into phonc%c form. 
For some~ utterances, the phon('tic transcription 
was manually adjusted to the idiosynerasi(;s of the 
speaker. For example, it often happened that 
confusion arises between open and closed vow- 
els, such in the ~ord '~zoologique" zoological that 
can be pronomtced e i ther /zoo loa ik /or /zaa los ik / .  
In case the output was /zooloaik/ instead of the 
expe(%ed /zaalosik/, the transcription was read- 
justed. 
2.7 Segmentation 
Segmentation is presently in progress; efforts are 
being pursued to adapt an automatic segmentor 
for English to French and other languages. In the 
meantime, rnannal segmentation is being done as 
a pilot experiment in order to cheek the accuracy 
of automatic segmentation. Beyond the scope of 
this paper are many complex issues raised in seg- 
menting French, such as the segmentation of semi- 
voweds ( / j / ,  /w/ ,  and /q / )  and liquids ( / l /  and 
/ r / ) ,  each of these phonemes being quite unstable 
f?om a phonetic-~eoustic standpoint. These issues 
will be addressed in hmm; work. 
2.8 Integration of an orthographic 
transcriber 
A grapheme-to-phoneme transcriber \[?\] was ac- 
quired to convert French orthography to a phone.- 
mie representation. The software performs some 
syntactic and partial semantic analysis of the sen- 
tence in order to disambiguate the input string. 
Once performed, spellings at0. converted in a se- 
ries of steps into a phonernic representation. 
3 I ssues  in  Text  Analysis 
We have t)nrsued work in the text analysis of 
French in order to obtain linguistic data for in- 
tonation and prosody; additionally, the output of 
the work will be used in the translation project. 
This aspect of the work has entailed several points: 
? acquisition of a large French dictionary:

The French TTS  system is part  of a large project 
of mult i l iugua\]  text-to-sl>eech synthesis ill progress 
at AT? 'T  Bell I~ahoratories. Speech synthesis 
for French brings a variety of chalh!nges, some of 
which are specific to French, such as nasal izat ion, 
liaison, schwa realization, etc. and some of which 
are more general issues, such as vowel hmgthen= 
ing, prosodic cont, ouring, and intonat ion.  Several 
systems are. in exp<!rin|e|d;al stages for other lan- 
guages, such as Spanish (Cast i l ian as well as South 
Ame.ri<'ar0, I tal ian, Chinese, Navajo, German,  aud 
Russian. Once C, ont inenta l  French is eomph'.ted, 
981 
we also intend to build a TTS system for Canadian 
French.
