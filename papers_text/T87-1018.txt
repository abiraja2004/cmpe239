Whither Discourse n.nd Speech Acts?

In addition to the questions initially posed on discourse theory and speech acts 
(and listed in the proceedings), the panelists were asked to consider how their beliefs 
about discourse and speech acts had changed in the last five or so years, and in partic- 
ular to consider the following two questions: 
Of what you believed about discourse five years ago, what now 
strikes you as most  wrong? 
What are you less confused about now than five years ago? 
The panelists papers and a glance through the proceedings of the previous two 
T INLAP meetings uggests that we have in fact learned a good deal and that research 
in discourse and speech act theory has become much more focused in the last five or 
so years. Several theories of discourse have been proposed to account for the struc- 
ture and processing of extended sequences of utterances. In a recent paper 
\[Grosz&Sidner86\], Candy Sidner and I present one such theory and discuss a range of 
alternative ones. Other research has provided partial accounts for the interpretation 
and generation in discourse of individual expressions, clauses, and interclausal connec- 
tions (e.g., \[McKeown85\], \[Appelt85\], \[Groszeta183\], \ [Mann&Thompson83\]  
\[Sidner83\], \[Webber83\],\[Hobbs79\]).  These theories differ in the predictions they 
? make about discourse structure and coherence, and about the processing of various 
types of linguistic expressions (e.g., cue phrases, definite descriptions, and pronouns).  
Initial psychological investigations into various aspects of these theories are being car- 
ried out. 
One of the most  striking changes is that research on discourse and speech act 
theories now typically addresses more specific questions, a fact illustrated by the papers 
for this panel. In addressing the role of research on speech for discourse, Hirschberg 
describes results that reveal the crucial role of information provided in the speech sig- 
nal; she argues that simpler solutions to many discourse problems are available only if 
one does not ignore speech. Perrault discusses various key problems that arise in tak- 
ing seriously the intuitions underlying "speech act theory,"  in looking in detail at what 
it means to say that utterances are actions that most  directly affect the mental  state of 
the participants in the discourse; he indicates the variety of approaches being taken to 
specific problems within this framework and their connection to work more generally 
in natural-language s mantics. 
Another  clear difference from the previous two T INLAP meetings is the more 
general acknowledgement of the pervasiveness of the role of intentions and plans in 
discourse. These affect not  only the interpretation of individual utterances, but also of 
extended sequences of utterances and of individual phrases within an utterance. This 
recognition has led to a close examination of theories of planning and action; it has 
become clear that work in AI on planning is insufficient to support  discourse 
86 
processing. Wilensky argues for much more complex notions of plans and goals to 
support discourse processing; he describes a range of discourse problems requiring 
these and indicates research directed toward developing them. Other recent research 
(e.g., \[Pollack86\], [iautz&Allen86\]) has examined the adequacy of current models of 
planning for plan recognition and developed alternative models better able to support 
discourse processing. 
In brief, we seem to have gotten much closer to understanding what the prob- 
lems, are; there is still much to do -- and much disagreement about how -- to solve 
these problems.
