Abstract 
The verb subcategorization frame information 
plays a major role of disambiguations in many 
NLP applications. Japanese, however, imposes 
difficulties of subcategorizing in part because it 
allows arbitrary ellipses of case elements. We 
propose a new type of verb subcategorization 
frame code set that combines the verb's surface 
case set and the deep case set, as a solution to the 
difficulties of empirical researches on Japanese. 
The lexicon developed by this design has 
comprehensive information on the correspond- 
ences between the surface case frame and the 
deep case frame, and yet restrains the potential 
combinatorial explosion of the number of verb 
subcategorization frames by carefully identifying 
superficially different frames with an idea of 
alternative case markers and semantic roles, and 
by introducing the notion of surface case frame 
permutations. The number of different surface/ 
deep case mapping types is 250, after we 
completed the new subcategorization frame code 
development for 30,000 verbs and adjectives. 
1. Introduction 
An NLP system is supposed to be able to recognize 
the differences and commonalities between almost he 
same set of words in two different syntactic 
structures, such as "Mary bit the dog" vs "Mary was 
bit by the dog." Considering this requirement, he 
contents in verb subcategorization frames play a 
major role of disambiguations in many NLP systems. 
These frames should reflect linguistic facts of 
lexical information being concentrated on verbs. 
There have been, on the other hand, some researches 
that aim to equally treat lexical information of nouns 
and that of verbs (see e.g. EDR94). Pustejovsky91 
stepped further into formulating useful, intrinsic 
information in nouns with the notion of eo-compos- 
itionality among others, so as to recover from an 
elliptical sentence such as 'he began the book' a 
default verb such as 'reading.' However, in order to 
develop a working NLP system, even these recent 
researches may presuppose the use of exhaustive 
coding of verb subcategorization frame knowledge to 
let the new lexical features be automatically extracted 
and fully functional in their systems. 
Ellipses appear to be a much more serious problem 
with Japanese than with English because all the 
supposedly obligatory case elements are virtually free 
to be dropped or to be placed anywhere in the 
sentence xcept for the predicate position at the end. 
These phenomena seem to have imposed difficulties 
upon the design of the lexicon so that no list of 
Japanese verb classes and types comparable to 
Grishman94, Levin93 or Hornby75 for English was 
readily available when our project started 1. Thus, we 
decided to make one by ourselves by a bootstrapping 
method: to make the initial list of the classification 
and to make it to grow by developing a working 
lexicon for MT systems. Upon this empirical study 
and development of over 30,000 Japanese verbs and 
adjectives, we propose an architecture for verb 
subcategorization that represents the mapping 
information between surface case frame and deep case 
(thematic role) frame. 
The proposal is to serve as a solution to the empirical 
difficulties with Japanese verbs and case elements 
described above. The lexicon by this design has 
comprehensive information on both the surface frame 
and the deep frame, and the correspondences between 
them, which are embedded in a code Yet, the number 
of codes has been controlled under a manageable 
figure of several hundreds o that the coding system 
could evade the potential combinatorial explosion. 
This is to be done by identifying superficially 
different case patterns with an idea of alternative case 
markers and semantic roles, and by largely extending 
the notion and the formulation of voice conversion for 
Japanese auxiliary verbs and equivalents. 
The developed lexicon is adopted in a real world 
scale intedingua-based MT system that translates 
between English and Japanese (Muraki87). Our aim 
I 
Martin75 & FM&T85 contain some lists, but is too partial 
for the purpose of developing an MT system. 
640 
here is to show an empirical result of the development 
and analysis of the lexicon from the point of view of 
space complexity order (cf. Jackendoflg0&93). In the 
following section are described the major linguistic 
requirements of the architecture, the case elements of 
which are free of word ordering and can increase in 
number when their voice is converted. The 
architecture that combines the verb surface case frame 
and deep case frame is described in section 3, 
followed by extended mechanisms lot applying what 
we generalized from voice conversion phenomena 
triggered by auxiliary verbs. We, then, describe the 
lexicon structure for ambiguity representations in
relation to word senses. Finally, we present some 
statistic figures from the results of the lexicon 
development and confirm that the proposed 
architecture and the code system can empirically 
constrain the potential combinatorial explosions of the 
verb subcategorization frame representation varieties. 
2. Linguistic Requirements of Verb 
subcategorization Frames 
The most notable syntactic phenomenon of Japanese 
is so-called scrambling. Any verb-modifying NP in a 
simple sentence in Japanese can appear at any 
position or does not have to appear at all, regardless 
of its surface case and deep case. In other words, 
word ordering is almost free for the major syntactic 
elements in a Japanese simple sentence xcept or the 
predicate itself, which is to be placed at the end of the 
sentence. Not the word ordering but case 
postpositions mark the case of these NPs in relation to 
the main verb. All the examples in e.g. 2-1 lead to the 
same event structure interpretation, which is shared 
by the English translation "X gives Y to Z. ''2 
e.g. Z-1 a. ok "X-ga Y-wo Z-ni age-ru" 
b. ok "Y-wo X-go Z-ni age-ru" 
c. ok "Y-wo Z-ni X-go oge-ru" 
d. ok "X-go Z-ni Y-wo age-ru" 
e. ok "Z-ni X-go Y-wo oge-ru" 
f .  ok "Z-ni Y-wo X-ga oge-ru" 
Particles "-ga", "-wo" and "-ni" are the most 
frequently used case postpositions that often mark 
nominative, accusative, and dative cases, respectively ~ 
? There are various other alternative postpositions that 
can replace or be added to these case postpositions. 
Discourse representing postpositions uch as "-ha", 
which had been erroneously treated as general subject 
2 The differences concern the emphasis and scope that are 
to be handled by a pragmatics system. 
3 "-ga" can sometimes mark accusative case and "-ni" can 
mark various other cases and semantic roles including 
"locative" and "time." 
marker, could replace "-wo" and "-ga", and could be 
added to "-ni". These replacement or addition do not 
alter the basic event structure of the sentences (2-1 
a.,b ..... f.), but sometimes just add ambiguities to the 
syntactic structure as is shown in e.g. 2-2. 
e.g. 2-2 a. ok "X-ha Y-ha Z-ni age-ru" 
b. ok "Y-ha X-ha Z-ni age-ru" 
Practical Japanese sentence analyzers would need 
some semantic inference and default inference to 
plausibly identify X and Y using the semantic 
restrictions on each case element and the standard 
word ordering. Most nominative cases in Japanese 
verbs including "agc-ru" ('to give') have strong 
preference for human/animate attribute so that a 
meaningful difference between semantic similarity of 
X to animate object and the similarity of Y to other 
kind of concrete object leads to allocate nominative 
case on X and accusative case on Y in either 2-2 a. or 
2-2 b. If there is no such difference in the semantic 
restriction score, the standard word ordering "-ga," "- 
wo," and "-hi" seems to let the listener to interpret 
'e.g. 2-2 a' as 'e.g. 2-1a'. 
Japanese not only has typical voice conversions 
such as passivization but also appears to have similar 
phenomena that alter tile surface case markings uch 
as the cases with causative construction. This 
variation roughly corresponds to the variety of 
English auxiliary verbs and higher predicate verbs 
such as "dekiru (can)," "rareru (be pp./ can)," 
"kotoga-dekiru (be able to)," "tai (want to)," "seru 
(make/let)," "garu (feel complement)" etc. 
e.g.2-3 
a. X-ga Y-wo tabe-ru, b. X-hi Y-ga tabe-rareru. 
X-NOM Y-ACC eat. X-DAT Y-NOM eat-PASSIVE 
"X eats Y . . . .  X can eat Y" xor "X is eaten by Y" 
As is observed in e.g. 2-3, the nominative case marker 
"-ga" turns into dative case marker "-ni" and the 
accu,~ative case marker "-wo" turns into nominative 
case marker "-ga" when the passive~potential auxiliary 
verb "rareru" is attached. 
Multiple voice conversions can often occur for a 
single verb phrase as is shown in e.g. 2-3c. 
e.g.2-3 c. X-ga Y-wo Z-ni tabe-sase-rare-taku-nai. 
X-NOM Y-ACC Z-DAT eat-CAUS-PASS-WANT-NOT. 
"X does not want to be lbrced to eat Y by Z" 
Since three auxiliary verb forms CAUS, PASS and 
WANT appear by this ordering in e.g. 2-3 c, a simple, 
natural solution to correctly recognize the scope of 
complex modality features is to recursively apply the 
pernmtations of surface case set as is described in the 
following section.

3. Combining Surface and Deep Frames 
3-1. Basic Representation for Japanese Verb 
Subcategorization Frame 
Empirical studies as we observed in the previous 
section have suggested that combining syntactic and 
semantic frames could lead to an optimum efficiency 
of lexicon descriptions. Thus we created the basic 
description framework in the verb lexicon as is shown 
in fig. 1. 
Slot name: \[WITH FROM BY/IN NOM2 
NOM ~CC DAT 
Surface GA/deha(pl) iWO NI/he 
case frame <animai~e> <time> 
Deep case AGenT PAT- GOAl 
frame ient 
F ig . l  Subcategorization Frame for "ageru" 
The example content in Fig. 1 is that of the verb 
"ageru (give)" used in e.g. 2-1 and e.g. 2-2. Anatural 
language analyzer in an MT system is supposed to 
convert he case elements in e.g. 2-1 a,..,f, X, Y and 
Z to AGenT, PATient and GOAl, respectively, as 
shown in e.g. 3-1. 
e.g. 3-1 a. ok"X-ga Y-wo Z-ni age-m" 
b. ok "Y-wo X-ga Z-hi age-m" 
X = John -> AGenT ; Y = the book -> PATient ; 
Z = Mary -> GOAl 
The analyzer looks up the slots in Surface case frame 
and find the match of the case postposition; for "-ga", 
GA in the NOM case slot matches and the deep case 
that is stored in the NOM slot is taken out from the 
subcategorization frame. The analyzer checks if the 
semantic restriction 'animate' matches the case 
element X (John). If it fails, the analyzer looks for 
other slots, the other subcategorization frame of the 
same verb, and then the frames of other verbs that 
appear in the different place of the sentence. 
Fig. 1 shows a fixed frame with seven case slots, 
and this is exactly what the record format of our 
Japanese lexicon is. Why is it not necessary to have 
more slots though we know there are definitely more 
than seven case postpositions in Japanese? One of 
the reasons 4 is that other postpositions that can be 
mapped into a thematic role are supposed to fall into 
either of the seven slot and take the position as the 
alternative case markers. For example, "deha" in 
Fig.l could only be used with animate plural nouns 
such as "kotira ('our side')," but it certainly could 
mark the nominative case. 
4 The other eason is that there are case postpositions that 
are not mapped into thematic role. They constitutes not 
argument structure but just adjuncts (free elements) as is 
explained in modern Linguistics. 
The alternative case postposition "deha" also 
complies with the Unique Case Principle 5 that 
prohibits other case elements from filling the same 
slot as NOM that is already filled by "X-deha". This 
is why this use of case postposition "deha," with a 
different semantic restriction, is supposed to occupy 
the same slot NOM with the major case postposition 
"-ga". Another slot DAT in Fig.1 shows that "-he" 
could replace the major case postposition "-ni" and be 
assigned the thematic role GOAl. Again, the 
following ungrammatical example e.g. 3-2 that 
violates the Unique Case Principle shows that "-ni" 
and "-he" for the verb "ageru" have to share the same 
slot in the subcategorization frame. 
e.g. 3-2 * X-ga Y-wo Z-ni Z'-he age-ta. 
X-NOM Y-ACCZ-DAT Z'-DAT give-PERFective 
"X gave Y to Z '. " 
For a simple Japanese analyzer that tries to fill as 
many slots as possible for a verb, the Unique Case 
Principle is virtually embedded in the subcategorizat- 
ion frame of our architecture for the computational 
lexicon. 
The slot name NOM2 represent the typical case with 
two-term adjectival predicate? that require two 
nominative cases. 
e.g.3-3 "X-ga Y-ga sukina-no-ha.." 
X-NOM 
"That X likes Y is..." 
3-2. Generating Permutational Subcatego- 
rization Frame Triggered by AUX Verbs 
We have generalized the notion of voice conversion 
for Japanese auxiliary verbs and equivalents by 
abstracting 14 codes of case frame permutation. 
These codes, the contents of which are to be 
elaborated in the fig. 2 & 3, are assigned on the 
extended category of auxiliary verbs "dekiru (can)," 
"rareru (be pp./can)," "kotoga-dekiru (be able to)," 
"tai (want to)," "seru (make/let)," "garu (feel 
complement)". Below is the description of the 
procedure by which the Japanese analyzer performs 
the permutation ofthe verb subcategorization frame. 
When the morphological analyzer detects an 
auxiliary verb or an equivalent while checking the 
information contained in the predicate phrase, the 
analyzer develops the verb subcategorization frame 
from the code in the verb's lexicon and read from the 
5 - " The Unique Case Principle in Case Grammar and 
empirical studies is formulated and explained by the 
Lexicalist Hypothesis about hematic roles and the X-bar 
Theory in the school of Universal Grammar (Chomsky88). 
6 There is only one verb "komaru (be in trouble)", the 
active voice of which shows two nominative cases CGA"s). 
642 
auxiliary verbs' lexicon what we call the Surface Case 
Permutation Frame code (SCPF code). The analyzer 
generates the subcategorization frame for the entire 
predicate by applying the permutation commands 
developed from the SCPF code for one auxiliary verb 
at a time. The first permutation is performed for the 
first auxiliary verb next to the main verb, and the 
locus moves on from the main verb to the first 
auxiliary verb. The second permutation is performed 
for the second auxiliary verb next to the first auxiliary 
verb, and the focus moves on to the second attxiliary 
verb. And so on: the N-th permutation is performed 
for the N-th auxiliary verb next to the (N-l)-th 
auxiliary verb, and the locus moves on from the (N- 
l)-thauxiliary verb to the N-th auxiliary verb. The 
maximum number for N is actually set to three in our 
MT system, reflecting the numbers of auxiliary verbs 
in real utterances and written sentences. 
e.g.3-3 a. X-gaY-wo taberu. 
X-NON Y-ACC cat. 
"X eats Y " 
b. Z-ga Y-wo X-nitabe-saseru. 
Z-NON Y-ACC Z-DAT eat-CAUS. 
"Z makes X to eat Y" 
c. X-ga Y-wo Z-hi tabe-sase-rareru. 
X-NON Y-ACC Z-DAT eat-CAUS-PASS. 
"X was made to eat Y by Z" 
A correct process would generate the subcategor- 
ization frames represented in the example sentences 
from e.g. 3-3a via e.g. 3-3b to e.g. 3-3c, where all 
case elements X, Y and Z are consistent in these three 
sentences. The SCPF code in the causative auxiliary 
verb "saseru" has two ambiguities of the set of 
permutation commands as is shown in Fig.2. 
pei~t.tion commands I Permutation c mmands 
Caus. NULL > GA \[CAUser\] Caus. NULL > GA\[CAUser\] 
\] A I GA >NI/NIYORI I B I GA >WO 
Fig.2 SCPF Codes and PermutQtion Commands for "saseru" 
The set of original postpositions i described in the 
left term (in the source direction of an arc) in the 
permutation commands. 'NULL' term 
unconditionally matches and adds an extra case slot 
with a new deep case described within the bracket on 
the right term (\[CAUser\]). If all the left term 
condition for matching the case markers meet, the 
permutation frame is valid and the number of 
subcategorization frames for a predicated is 
sometimes increases. In the above example, 
however, the permutation commands of Causative B
results in generating two identical case markers 'WO" 
violating the Unique Surface Case Principle as is 
shown in e.g.3-4, so the pelxnutation is blocked. 
e.g.3-4 a. X-gaY-wotaberu. 
X-NOM Y-ACC eat. 
"X eats Y " 
b. *Z-ga Y-wo X-wo tabe-saseru. 
Z-NOM Y-ACC Z-ACC eat-CAUS. 
The second auxiliary verb "rareru" has even more 
ambiguities in meaning, each of which corresponds to
six different Permutation Frames as is shown in Fig.3. 
l irect \] GA > NI/ NIYORI assive\] WO > GA 
\[ Indirec~ NULL >GA\[EXP\] Passive I GA >NI/NIYORI

.}5 I 
IAutono- I GA > NI

Fig.3 SCPF Codes 0nd Permutation Commands "rareru" 
The analyzer follows the permutation procedure 
described above for the second auxiliary verb. All the 
permutation commands in fig.3 actually can match the 
original surface case flame of e,g. 3-3b. It is a set of 
independent semantic heuristic rules that drops the 
'Autonomous' reading of "rareru" and ahnost drops tile 
'Honorific' reading of "rareru". All the other 
subcategorization frames for 'Direct Passive,' 'Indirect 
Passive,' 'Dative Passive,' and 'Possibility' are 
generated with slightly different variations of 
alternative surface case markers. The sentence in 
e.g. 3-3c can mean any of these but 'Indirect Passive,' 
the whole sentence of which is shown in e.g. 3-3d. 
e.g.3-3 d. E-gaX-ni Y-wo Z~ni tabe-sase-rareru. 
E-NON X-DATY-ACC Z-DAT eaDCAUS-PASS. 
"E experienced that X was made to eat Y by Z" 
It is still grammatical, but is much more difficult to 
get the meaning of it because it has four arguments for 
the single verb. This factor alone can be used by the 
analyzer to restrain the application of the generated 
subcategorization frame for the 'Indirect Passive' 
interpretation. 
3-3. Two Cases of Multiple Deep Cases in 
a Single Slot 
There are two kinds of description by which 
multiple deep cases are described in a deep case slot 
of a subcategorization frame (Fig.l). One is 
selectional, and the other is overlapping. The 
selectional one is the use of alternative deep cases and 
meets the needs of economical description of the 
lexicon and also the manageability of it. 
c.g.3-5 
a. "The typhoon\[REAson\] has broken a part he city block." 
b. "A monster \[AGenT\] has broken a part he city block." 
643 
In these examples, not the verb "break", but the 
semantics of the subject decides what deep case the 
subject should be allocated. So, instead of assigning 
only one deep case onto the deep case slot and create 
bunch of whole subcategorization frames, we 
introduced an ambiguity marker such as AIRM 
(AGenT/INStrument/REAson/MEAns) to be assigned 
on the case slot. In this case, the analyzer does not 
have to decide the deep case until when necessary at 
whatever point in the phases of MT 7. 
The other kind of description is 'overlapping' of 
deep cases. 
Slot nome: NOM ACC DAT WITH 
Deep cose AGenT PAT- GOAl n/a 
frame: &\[SOuRce\] ient  
Fig. 4 Deep Case Overlop 
Fig.4 shows ahnost he same deep case frame as in 
Fig.1 that shows the subcategorization frame of verb 
"ageru (give)". The only difference is the deep case 
\[SOuRce\] added to the AGenT. Other kind of 
transitive verbs such as "taberu (eat)" may not let the 
\[SOuRce\] be added because the AGenT here is not 
the SOuRce position of the PATient in the 
event/action. "Taberu (eat)" may let \[GOAl\] be \] 
added to the AGenT. This distinction may work in 
the later knowledge-based inference phases of the MT 
system. 
3-4. Lexicon Structure in Relation to 
Word Senses 
There are cases in which one word sense 
corresponds to multiple subcategorization frames, 
other cases in which one word sense corresponds to 
one subcategorization frame each, and the other cases 
in which multiple word senses correspond to less 
number of subcategorization frames. Since our 
approach ere is rather empirical so any guidelines 
that help the lexicon to be uniform in quality, we take 
advantage of other literature that aimed at some 
exhaustive listing of interesting cases. The example 
sentences in e.g. 3-6 are cited from Fillmore68, and 
e.g. 3-7, from Levin93. 
e.g.3-6 a. John opened the door with the key. 
b. The key opened the door. 
c. The door opened. 
d. John ate the meal. e. John ate. 
e.g.3-7 a. John pounded the metal \[flat\]. 
b. Metal pounded flat. 
c. * Metal pounded. 
7 The decision point could be even delayed into the 
generation phase of MT. 
As is briefly mentioned in the previous sections, the 
entry in our lexicon is composed of three blocks: M 
(Morphology)-Block, S (Syntax)-Block and C 
(Concept)-Block. M-Block contains the very surface 
information and can in general be linked to multiple 
S-Blocks. A whole subcategorization frame is 
described and stored in a S-Block coupled with 
corresponding other syntactic features uch as aspect 
features. A C-Block linked from an S-Block or more 
represents an independent word sense, and, ideally, is 
linked to by other S-blocks that are linked to by other 
M-Blocks, in effect, other words of the same or the 
different language. 
The basic principle of the lexicon requires one to one 
correspondences between a subcategorization frame 
and an S-Block. So, any sentence in e.g. 3-6 or e.g. 3- 
7 ~ corresponds to a different S-Block from the others 
(except for e.g. 3-7c that does not exist). Any two 
S-Blocks can share the same word sense (C-Block) as 
long as the deep case (thematic role) frame is 
consistent. That is, all the case roles that appear in 
e.g.3-6 a, b and c are assigned different deep cases 
from one another: {John = AGenT, door = PATient, 
key = INStrument}. So are all the case roles in e.g. 
3-6 a and b, and all the case roles in e.g. 3.7. Thus, 
our system of the lexicon could guarantee that these 
subcategorization frame s of intuitively the same word 
sense share the same C-Block. 
There are other cases in which the above criteria 
require to separate the intuitively single word sense as 
is shown in e.g. 3-8 
e.g.3-8 
a. John smeared the window\[PATient\] withthe paint. 
b. John smeared thepaint\[PATient\] on the window. 
If a lexicographer is asked to fill in the deep cases as 
usual in the S-Blocks of e.g.3-8 a and b, he or she will 
assign PATient on window in e.g.3-8 a, and on paint 
in e.g.3-8 b. This inconsistency in the case assign- 
ment does not allow the lexicon to allocate the same 
C-Block to both e.g.3-8 a and b. NJ&B94 gives a 
solution to this kind of case by introducing some 
deeper conceptual primitives than our deep cases. 
4. The Development Results of a 
Computational Japanese Lexicon for MT 
We have developed a computational Japanese 
lexicon with more than 80 thousand words, 30 
thousand of which are verbs and their derivations. A 
key part of the development was to establish word 
8 Lexical Entry for the verb 'pound' : M-block: { pound }

senses by means of comparing synonymous 
vocabulary sets of Japanese and English \[Nomura89\]. 
Each verb subcategorization frame is coded in what 
we call S-Block that is placed between M-Block that 
contains the very surface level information and C- 
Block that is supposed to contain language 
independent, purely conceptual information. 
Among 34 deep cases we defined for the Interlingua, 
which is fewer than those in previous (e.g. NagaoS0), 
16 are currently used in the deep frame of our 
Japanese verb frame system.(Fig.5)

lqg.5 The 16 Deep Cases Described in the Subcategorization 
Frames for Japanese Verbs and Prediwttive Adjectives 
The result of coding subcategorization fi'ames for 30 
thousand verbs have listed up 18 case postpositions 
and standard word order used for verbs, and six, used 
for predicative adjectives. These figures are much 
smaller than the number of simple combinations: 7! = 
823,543. The numbers of voice conversion types that 
affects the surface case pattern was 14% The non- 
weighted mean number of the case slots tbr each 
lexicon is counted to 1.6 ; 30% of verbs are listed up 
to take multiple case patterns. This figure seems 
appropriate, considering the fact that most of Japanese 
transitive verbs and intransitive verbs take separate 
word lorms. 
The numbers of the variations of subeategorization 
frames in the lexicon was about 250 for ordinary 
verbs and adjectives, and we have 150 more for 
idiomatic ones. These are the figures alter 
disregarding, of course, the variation of selectional 
restrictions. The sum of these figures are also much 
smaller than that of simple combinations: (16C7) * 
(7!) = 57657600. 
Exhaustive listing of 400 combinatorial subcategor- 
ization frames has contributed much to improve the 
accuracy the contents in the lexicon. The lexicon 
specification by the proposed verb subcategorization 
codes and SCPF codes tins improved uniformity in 
quality and the speed of lexicon development aswell. 
5. Conclusion 
We proposed a knowledge representation framework 
for verb subcategorizations with combinatorial codes 
for the verb's surface case frame and deep case 
(thematic role) frame. The Japanese lexicon 
developed by this design has comprehensive

information on the mapping between the surface case 
frame and the deep case frame, and yet is free of 
potential combinatorial explosion due to an exhaustive 
empirical research and development of Japanese verbs 
and auxiliary verbs. The reduction of the number of 
verb subeategorization codes was made possible by 
carefully identifying superficially different case 
frames with the idea of alternative ase markers and 
semantic roles. The benefits include more manage- 
able, repeatable lexicon realized by reducing the 
underlying redundancy of information in some 
distributed architecture of the computational lexicon. 
The future tasks should include further explorations of 
providing the concept dictionary with more syntactic 
test conditions and extensions to more than two 
languages other than English and Japanese.
