Abstract
We present a method that filters out non-
scorable (NS) responses, such as responses
with a technical difficulty, in an automated
speaking proficiency assessment system. The
assessment system described in this study first
filters out the non-scorable responses and then
predicts a proficiency score using a scoring
model for the remaining responses.
The data were collected from non-native
speakers in two different countries, using two
different item types in the proficiency assess-
ment: items that elicit spontaneous speech and
items that elicit recited speech. Since the pro-
portion of NS responses and the features avail-
able to the model differ according to the item
type, an item type specific model was trained
for each item type. The accuracy of the mod-
els ranged between 75% and 79% in spon-
taneous speech items and between 95% and
97% in recited speech items.
Two different groups of features, signal pro-
cessing based features and automatic speech
recognition (ASR) based features, were im-
plemented. The ASR based models achieved
higher accuracy than the non-ASR based mod-
els.
1 Introduction
We developed a method that filters out non-scorable
(NS) responses as a supplementary module to an
automated speech proficiency assessment system.
In this study, the method was developed for a
telephony-based assessment of English proficiency
for non-native speakers. The examinees? responses
were collected from several different environmen-
tal conditions, and many of the utterances contain
background noise from diverse sources. In ad-
dition to the presence of noise, many responses
have other sub-optimal characteristics. For exam-
ple, some responses contain uncooperative behav-
ior from the speakers, such as non-English speech,
whispered speech, and non-responses. These types
of responses make it difficult to provide a valid as-
sessment of a speaker?s English proficiency. There-
fore, in order to address the diverse types of causes
for these problematic responses, we used a two step
approach: first, these problematic responses were
filtered out by a ?filtering model,? and only the re-
maining responses were scored using the automated
scoring model.
The overall architecture of our method, includ-
ing the automated speech proficiency scoring sys-
tem, is as follows: for a given spoken response,
the system performs speech recognition, yielding a
word hypothesis and time stamps. In addition to
word recognition, the system computes pitch and
power to generate prosodic features; the system cal-
culates descriptive statistics such as the mean and
standard deviation of pitch and power at both the
word level and response level. Given the word hy-
potheses and pitch/power features, it derives features
for automated proficiency scoring. Next, the non-
ASR based features are calculated separately using
signal processing techniques. Finally, given both
sets of features, the filtering model identifies NS re-
sponses.
This paper will proceed as follows: we will re-
view previous studies (Section 2), present the data
152
(Section 3), and then describe the structure of the
filtering model (Section 4). Next, the results will
be presented (Section 5), followed by a discussion
(Section 6), and we will conclude with a summary
of the importance of the findings (Section 7).
2 Previous Work
Higgins et al (2011) developed a ?filtering model?
that is conceptually similar to the one in this pa-
per. The model was trained and tested on a corpus
containing responses from non-native speakers to an
English proficiency assessment. This system used
a regression model based on four features which
were originally designed for automated speech pro-
ficiency scoring: the number of distinct words in the
speech recognition output, the average speech rec-
ognizer confidence score, the average power of the
speech signal, and the mean absolute deviation of
the speech signal power. This model was able to
identify responses which were also identified as NS
responses by human raters with an approximately
98% accuracy when a false positive rate (the propor-
tion of responses without technical difficulties that
were incorrectly flagged as problematic) was lower
than 1%.
Although there are few other studies which are di-
rectly related to the task of filtering out non-scorable
responses in the domain of automated speech profi-
ciency assessment, several signal processing studies
are related to this work. Traditionally, the Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) has been used to detect speech
with a large amount of background noise. This
method measures the ratio between the total energy
of the speech signal and the total energy of the noise;
if the SNR is low, then the speech contains loud
background noise. A low SNR results in lower in-
telligibility and increases the difficulty for both hu-
man and automated scoring. Furthermore, spectral
characteristics can be also applied to detect speech
with loud background noise, since noise has differ-
ent spectral characteristics than speech (noise tends
to have no or few peaks in the spectral domain).
If a response contains loud background noise, then
the spectral characteristics of the speech may be ob-
scured by noise and it may have similar character-
istics with the noise. These differences in spectral
characteristics have been used in audio information
retrieval Lu and Hankinson (1998).
Secondly, responses without valid speech can be
identified using Voice Activity Detection (VAD).
VAD is a technique which distinguishes human
speech from non-speech. When speech is clean,
VAD can be calculated by simply computing the
zero-crossing rate which signals the existence of
cyclic waves such as vowels. However, if the re-
sponse also contains loud background noises, more
sophisticated methods are required. In order to re-
move the influence of noise, Chang and Kim (2003),
Chang et al (2006), Shin et al (2005) and Sohn et
al. (1999) estimated the characteristics of the noise
spectrum and the distribution of noise, and compen-
sated for them when speech is identified. The perfor-
mance of these systems is heavily-influenced by the
accuracy of estimating characteristics of the back-
ground noise.
In this study, we used a set of ASR based fea-
tures and non-ASR based features. ASR based fea-
tures were similar to the ones used by Zechner et al
(2009). In addition to the features based on ASR
hypotheses, the ASR based feature set contained ba-
sic pitch and power related features since the ASR
system in this study also produced pitch and power
measurements in order to generate prosodic features.
The non-ASR based features were comprised of four
groups of features based on signal processing tech-
niques such as SNR, VAD, and pitch and power.
Features related to pitch and power were included in
both the ASR based features and the non-ASR based
features. Since the non-ASR based features were
originally implemented as an independent module
from the ASR-based system (it was implemented for
the case where the appropriate recognizer is unavail-
able), there is some degree of overlap between the
two feature sets.
3 Data
The data for this experiment were drawn from a pro-
totype of a telephony-based English language as-
sessment. Non-native speakers of English each re-
sponded to 40 test items designed to evaluate their
level of English proficiency. The test was composed
of items that elicited both spontaneous speech (here-
after SS) and recited speech (hereafter RS). In this
study, 8 items (four SS and four RS) were used for
153
each speaker.
Participants used either a cell phone or a land
line to complete the assessment, and the participants
were compensated for their time. The motivation
level of the participants was thus lower than in the
case of an actual high stakes assessment, where a
participant?s performance could have a substantial
impact on their future. In addition, the data collec-
tion procedure was less controlled than in an op-
erational testing environment; for example, some
recordings exhibited higher levels of ambient noise
than others. These two facts led to the quality of
some of the responses being lower than would be
expected in an operational assessment.
The data for this study were collected from partic-
ipants in two countries: India and China. For India,
4900 responses from 638 speakers were collected.
For China, 5565 responses from 702 speakers were
collected (some of the participants did not provide
responses to all 8 test items). Each response is ap-
proximately 45 sec in duration.
After the data was collected, all of the responses
were given scores on a three-point scale by trained
raters. The raters also labeled responses as ?non-
scorable? (NS), when appropriate. NS responses are
ones that could not be given a score according to the
rubrics of the three-point scale. These were due to
either a technical difficulty obscuring the content of
the response or an inappropriate response from the
participant.
The proportion of NS responses differs markedly
between the two countries. 852 of the responses in
the India data set (17% of the total) were labeled as
NS, compared to 1548 responses (28%) in the China
data set.
Table 1 provides the different types of NS re-
sponses that were annotated by the raters, along with
the relative frequency of each NS category com-
pared to the others.
Excluding the category ?Other?, background
noise, non-responses, and unrelated topic were the
most frequent types of NS response for both data
sets. However, the relative proportions of each type
differed somewhat between the two countries. For
example, the most frequent NS type in India was
background noise; 33% of NS responses were of this
type, 1.7 times higher than in China.
The proportion of unrelated topic responses was

also high in both countries, but it was much higher
in the China data set: it was 19% in the responses
from India and 40% for China (more than twice as
high as in India). All responses which were not di-
rectly related to the prompt fell into this category.
For SS items, the majority included responses about
a different topic. For RS items, responses in which
the speakers read different prompts were classified
into this category.
The responses were divided into training and test-
ing for NS response detection. Due to the significant
difference in the proportion of NS responses and rel-
ative frequencies of NS types in the two data sets, fil-
tering models were trained separately for each coun-
try. In addition, since the proportions of NS re-
sponses and the available features varied according
to the item type, training and testing data were fur-
ther classified by item types. The proportions of NS
responses and the sizes of the partitions, along with
the percent of NS responses in each item type, are
shown in Table 2.
154
The partitions for testing the filtering model were
selected to maximize the number of speakers with
complete sets of responses; however, this constraint
was not able to be met for the training partitions in
the India data set (due to insufficient data). This ex-
plains the lower proportion of NS responses in the
India test partitions, since speakers with complete
sets of responses were less likely to provide bad re-
sponses. As Table 2 shows, NS responses were more
frequent among SS items than RS items: the pro-
portion of NS responses in SS items was four times
higher than in RS items in India and 1.5 times in
China.
4 Method
4.1 Overview
In this study, two different sets of features were used
in the model training process; ASR-based features
and non-ASR based features. For each item-type,
an item-type-specific filtering model was developed
using these two sets of features.
4.2 Feature generation
4.2.1 ASR based features
For this feature set, we used the features from
an automated speech proficiency scoring system.
This scoring system used an ASR engine containing
word-internal triphone acoustic models and item-
type-specific language models. Separate acoustic
models were trained for the data sets from the two
countries. The acoustic training data for the two
models consisted of 45.5 hours of speech from In-
dia and 123.1 hours of speech from China. In addi-
tion, separate language models were trained for the
SS and RS items for each country; for the RS items,
the language models also incorporated the texts of
the prompts.
A total of 61 features were available. Among
these features, many features were conceptually
similar but based on different normalization meth-
ods. These features showed a strong intercorrela-
tion. For this study, 30 features were selected and
classified into four groups according to their char-
acteristics: basic features, fluency features, ASR-
confidence features, and Word Error Rate (WER)
features.
The basic features are related to power and pitch,
and they capture the overall distribution of pitch and
power values in a speaker?s response using mean and
variance calculations. These features are relevant
since NS responses may have an abnormal distribu-
tion in energy. For instance, non-responses contain
very low energy. In order to detect these abnormal-
ities in speech signal, pitch and power related fea-
tures were calculated.
The fluency features measure the length of a re-
sponse in terms of duration and number of words.
In addition, this group contains features related to
speaking rate and silences, such as mean duration
and number of silence. In particular, these features
are effective in identifying Non-responses which
contain zero or only a few words.
The ASR-confidence group contains features pre-
dicting the performance of the speech recognizer.
Low speech recognition accuracy may be indicated
by low confidence scores.
Finally, the WER group provides features esti-
mating the similarity between the prompts and the
recognition output. In addition to the conventional
word error rate (WER), term error rate (TER) was
also implemented for the filtering model. TER is
a metric commonly used in spoken information re-
trieval, and it only accounts for errors in content
words. This measure may be more effective in iden-
tifying NS responses than conventional WER; for in-
stance, the overlap in function words between off-
topic responses and prompts can be correctly ig-
nored. TER was calculated according to the follow-
ing formula:
dif(Wc) =
{
0 ifCref (Wc) < Chyp(Wc)
Cref (Wc)? Chyp(Wc) otherwise
TER =
?
c?WC
dif(Wc)
?

(1)
where Cref (Wc) is the number of occurrences of
the word Wc in reference, Chyp(Wc) is the number
of occurrences of the word Wc in hypothesis, and
WC is the set of content words in reference.
Formula 1 differs from the conventional method

of calculating TER in two ways. Firstly, content
words which occurred only in the word hypothesis
are ignored in the formula. Secondly, if a word oc-
curred in the word hypothesis more frequently than
in the reference, the difference is ignored. These
modifications were made to address characteristics
of the responses in the data. On the one hand, speak-
ers occasionally inserted a few words such as ?too
difficult? at the end of a response. In addition, a few
speakers repeated words contained in the prompt
multiple times. The two modifications to TER ad-
dress both of these issues.
All features from the four groups are summarized
in Table 3.
4.2.2 Non-ASR based features
A total of 12 features from four different groups
were implemented using non-ASR based methods
such as VAD and SNR. These features are listed in
Table 4.

VAD proportion of voiced
frames in response, num-
ber and total duration of
voiced regions
Syllable number of syllables

mean, standard deviation
SNR SNR, speech peak
Table 4: List of non-ASR based features
VAD related features were implemented using the
ESPS speech analysis program. For every 10 mil-
lisecond interval, the voice frame detector deter-
mined whether the interval was voiced or not. Three
features were implemented using this voiced interval
information: the number of voiced intervals, ratio of
voiced intervals in the entire response, and the total
duration of voiced intervals.
In addition, the number of syllables was estimated
based on the flow of energy. The energy of the syl-
lable tends to reach its peak in the nucleus and the
dip in the boundaries. By counting the number of
such fluctuations in energy measurements, the num-
ber of syllables can be estimated. The Praat script
from De Jong and Wempe (2009) was used for this
purpose.
In order to detect the abnormalities in energy, am-
plitude based features were calculated. These fea-
tures were similar to the basic features in ASR based
features.
Finally, if a response contains loud background
noise, the ratio of speech to noise is low. SNR, the
mean noise level, and the peak speech level were
computed using the NIST audio quality assurance
package (NIST, 2009).
The VAD and syllable feature groups were de-
signed to estimate the number of syllables, the pro-
portion of speech to non-speech, and the total dura-
tion of speech intervals. These features were similar
to the number of words and duration of speech fea-
tures in the ASR-based feature set. Despite the con-
ceptual similarity, these features were implemented
since the two types of features were calculated us-
ing different characteristics of the spoken response.
156
The VAD and syllable features are based on the flow
of energy and the zero crossing rate and the ASR-
based features are based on the speech recognition.
In particular, the speech recognizer tends to gener-
ate word hypotheses even for responses that contain
no speech input, but VAD does not have such a ten-
dency. Due to this difference, VAD based features
may be more robust in the responses with no valid
speech.
4.3 Model building
For each response, both ASR features and non-ASR
features were calculated. In contrast to non-ASR
features, which were available for all responses,
ASR features (except the Basic group) were un-
available for some responses, namely, responses for
which the ASR system did not generate any word
hypotheses because no tokens received scores above
the rejection threshold. This causes a missing value
problem; about 7% of the responses did not have a
complete set of attributes.
Missing values are a common problem in machine
learning. One of the popular approaches is to replace
a missing value with a unique value such as the at-
tribute?s mean. Ding and Simonoff (2008) proposed
a method that replaces a missing value with an arbi-
trary unique value. This method is preferable when
missing of a value depends on the target value and
this relationship holds in both training and test data.
In this study, the missing values were replaced
with unique values due to the relationship between
the missing values and the target label; if the speech
recognizer did not produce any word hypotheses, the
response was highly likely to be a NS response. 63%
of the responses where the speech recognizer failed
to generate word hypotheses were NS responses.
Since all ASR-based features were continuous val-
ues, we used two real values: 0.0 for fluency features
and ASR features and 100.0 for word error rate fea-
tures. The fluency features and ASR features tend to
be 0.0 while the word error rate features tend to be
100.0 when the responses are NS responses.
A total of 42 features were used in the model
building. The only exception was WER; since WER
features were only available for the model based
on recited speech, they were calculated only for RS
items. Decision tree models were trained using the
J48 algorithm (WEKA implementation of C4.5) of
WEKA machine learning toolkit (Hall et al, 2009).
5 Results
For each item-type, three models were built to in-
vestigate the impact of each feature group: a model
using non-ASR features, a model using ASR fea-
tures, and a model using both features (the ?Com-
bined? model). Tables 5 and 6 present the accuracy
of the SS models and Tables 7 and 8 present the ac-
curacy of the RS models. In all tables, the base-
line was calculated using majority voting, and rep-
resented a system in which no responses were clas-
sified as NS; since the majority class was scorable,
the baseline using the majority voting did not predict
any response as non-scorable response. Therefore,
precision, recall, F-score are all 0 in this case.

model achieved 79% accuracy in India and 73% ac-

proximately 7% over the baseline. In both data sets,
the RS model achieved high accuracies: 97% accu-
racy in India and 96% accuracy in China. In India,

this represents a 2.4% improvement over the base-
line. Although the absolute value of this error re-
duction is not very large, the relative error reduc-
tion is 46%. In China, the improvement was more
salient; there was 18% improvement over baseline,
corresponding to a relative error reduction of 78%.
Additional experiments were conducted to deter-
mine the robustness of the filtering models to evalu-
ation data from a country not included in the train-
ing data. The evaluation sets from both item types
(SS and RS) in both countries (India and China)
were processed using three different models: 1) a
model trained using the ASR-based features for the
responses from the same country (the ?Same? con-
dition, whose results are identical to the ?ASR? re-
sults in Tables 5 - 8), 2) a model trained using the
ASR-based features for the responses from the other
country (the ?Different? condition), and 3) a model
trained using the ASR-based features for the re-
sponses from both countries (the ?Both? condition).
Table 9 presents the accuracy results for these four
sets of experiments.

Table 9: Accuracy results using training and evaluation
data from different countries
These results show that the models are quite ro-
bust to evaluation data from a different country. In
all cases, there is at most a small decline in perfor-
mance when training data from the other country is
used (in the case of the SS responses, there is even a
slight increase in performance). Table 9 also shows
that the RS models performed worse in the Different
Country condition (compared to the Same Country
condition) than the SS models. This difference is
likely due to the difference in the number of NS re-
sponses among the RS data in the two countries (as
shown in Table 2). However, the decline is still rel-
atively small, suggesting that it would be reasonable
to extend the filtering models to responses from ad-
ditional countries that were not seen in the training
data.
6 Discussion
Approximately 40 features were available for the
model building, but not all features had a signifi-
cant impact on the detection of NS responses. For
each item-type, the importance of features were fur-
ther investigated using a logistic regression analysis.
The training data of India and China were combined,
and a stepwise logistic regression analysis was per-
formed using the SPSS statistical analysis program.
For each item-type, the top 3 features are pre-
sented in Table 10; the features are presented in the
same order selected in the models.

For the RS items, TER was the best feature and it
was the top feature for both the ASR feature based
model and the combined model. The top 3 features
in the combined model were the same as the ASR
feature based model, and non-ASR features were not
158
selected. In non-ASR based features, the number of
syllables was the best feature, followed by the VAD
based features.
For the SS items, the top 2 features were the same
in both the ASR feature based model and the com-
bined model. The combined model selected one
non-ASR based feature, namely, a VAD based fea-
ture. As with the RS items, the number of syllables
was the best feature, followed by the energy related
feature.
These results show the importance of WER fea-
tures. Most of the current features are designed for
signal level abnormalities such as responses with
large background noise or non-responses. For in-
stance, fluency features and VAD features are effec-
tive for non-response detection, since they can deter-
mine whether the responses contain valid speech or
not. SNR and pitch/power related features are use-
ful for identifying responses with large background
noise. However, no features except the WER group
can identify content-level abnormalities such as un-
related topic and non-English responses. The high
proportion of these two types of responses (24%
in India and 46% in China) may be the major ex-
planation for the lower accuracy of the model for
SS responses than for RS responses. In the future,
content-related features should also be developed for
spontaneous speech.
The features selected the first time in the logis-
tic model differed according to item-types. The re-
sults support the item-type-specific model approach
adopted in this paper; item-type-specific models can
assign strong weights to the item-type-specific fea-
tures that are most important.
As shown in Tables 5 - 8, the combination of non-
ASR and ASR features could not achieve any fur-
ther improvement over the model consisting only of
ASR based features. However, in all cases, the non-
ASR based model did lead to some improvement
over the baseline. The magnitude of this improve-
ment was greater in SS items than RS items; in par-
ticular, it was greatest among the SS items in the
India data set. This difference may be due to the dif-
ferent distributions of the NS types among the data
sets. The non-ASR based features can cover only
limited types of NS responses such as non-responses
and responses with background noise, and the pro-
portion of these types is much higher among the SS
responses from India.
In addition, in RS items, the poor performance of
the combined model may be related to the high per-
formance of TER. The stepwise regression analysis
showed that the combined model did not select any
of non-ASR based features.
7 Conclusion
In this study, filtering models were implemented as a
supplementary module to an automated proficiency
scoring system. Due to the difference in the avail-
able features and proportion of NS responses, item-
type specific models were trained.
The item-types heavily influenced the overall
characteristics of the filtering models. First, the pro-
portion of NS responses was significantly different
according to item-type; it was much higher in spon-
taneous speech items than recited speech items. Sec-
ondly, the word error rate feature group was only
available for recited speech. Although the word er-
ror rate feature group contained three features, they
improved the performance of the filtering model sig-
nificantly.
ASR feature based models outperformed non-
ASR feature based models, but non-ASR based fea-
tures may be useful for new tests. Finally, experi-
ments demonstrated that the country-specific mod-
els using the ASR-based features are relatively ro-
bust to responses from a different country. This re-
sult suggests that this approach can generalize well
to speakers from different countries.
In this study, large numbers of features (42 for RS
items and 39 for SS items) were used in the model
training, but some features were conceptually simi-
lar and not all of them were significantly important;
the logistic regression analsysis using traning data
showed that there was no significant improvement
after selecting 5 features for RS items and 13 fea-
tures for SS items. Use of non-significant features
in the model training may result in the overfitting
problems. In future research, the features will be
classified into subgroups based on their conceptual
similarities; groups of features with high intercorre-
lations will be reduced to include only the best per-
forming feature in each group. Thus, based on care-
ful pre-selection procedures, only high performing
features will be selected, and the model will be re-
159
trained.
In addition, many different types of NS responses
were lumped into one big category (NS); this may
increase the confusion between scorable and non-
scorable responses and decrease the model?s perfor-
mance. Some of NS types have very different char-
acteristics compared to other NS types and this fact
caused critical differences in the feature values. For
instance, non-responses contained zero or close to
zero words, whereas non-English responses and off-
topic responses typically had a word count similar to
scorable responses. This difference may reduce the
effectiveness of this feature. In order to avoid this
type of problem, we will classify NS types into small
numbers of subgroups and build a seperate model for
each subgroup.
