AUTOMATIC  RECOGNIT ION OF SPEECH SOUNDS BY A D IG ITAL  
CO~UTER 
Three  cont r ibut ions  concern in~ the d i sc r iminat ion  o f  
the  momentan  spect rums of  some se lec ted  F inn ish  and  
German sounds  
The  main  d i f f i cu l t ies  in  the  speech  recogn i t ion  
may be l i s ted  in  the fo l low ing  way:  
lo Which  shou ld  be the bas ic  l inEu is t i c  un i t s  to be  re -  
cogn ized :  sounds  (a l lophones)  t phonemes  t segment  combi -  
nat ions  I sy l lab les  I words?  
2e Shou ld  the  output  text  be wr i t ten  or tograph~ca l ly?  
How then  the prob lem of  the d i f fe rences  between the 
phonemic  fo rm of  an  u t te rance  and  the or tography  shou ld  
be reso lved?  
3, I f  the word  is  chosen  as  bas ic  un i t s  fo r  the recogn i -  
t ion~ how one  shou ld  reso lve  the prob lem of  the grammat ica l  
f l ex ion  (e. E. in  F inn ish)?  
~o How can  the recogn i t ion  automat ion  dec ide  r where  there  
is a boundary  between two words  o r  two sentences?  
5? How can  the automat ion  dec ide  that  eeE.  the pause  
dur in  E a lon  E vo ice less  s top  consonant  is not  a boundary?  
6e How can  the automat ion  d i sc r iminate  the tona l  and  
c roneme c lasses  in  laEuaEes  9 in  wh ich  they  are l inEu is t i -  
ca l l y  re levant?  
7e The  automat ion  shou ld  not  take in to  account  the i r re le -  
vant  " - no l se$  one must  reEard  a l so  the no ise  produced  by  
the automat ion  i t se l f ?  
8. How to loca l i ze  the po in ts  in  the speech  cont inuum t 
wh ich  the recogn i t ion  can be based  on~ is there  one .  
spec ia l  acoust i c  segment  (or a momentan  spect rum)  fo r  
every  sound t wh ich  is character i s t i c ,  fo r  the sound?  
9. It has  been  shown that  segments ,  wh ich  are  1 i n g u - 
i s t i c a 1 1 y i d e n t i c a I t can  be acoust i ca l l y  
d i f fe rent .  The  d i f fe rences  are  due to fo l low in  E fac tors :  
(I) The  same speaker  can  not  p roduce  two exact  s imi la r  
sounds ,  because  the concept ion  of  the  ident i ty  is a human 
abst rac t ion .  (2) D i f fe rent  speakers  produce  l ingu is t i ca l l y  
the same sound in a d i f fe rent  way .  (~) L ingu is t i ca l l y  the. 
same. so~d can be mod i f ied  acoust i ca l l y  by  the word  promi -  
nence ,  sentence  prominence  I env i ronment ,  emot iona l  fac tors  t

Io. L i n g u i s t i c a 1 1 y d i f f e r e n t sounds  
can  be acoust i ca l l y  s imi la ro  
11. Shou ld  the phonotact i c  S t ruc tures  (S igurd)  or  the 
character i s t i c  sequenc ies  (P ike)  o f  a language be regarded  
when c reat ing  the  recogn i t ion  program?. 
12. The  techn ica l  p rob lems fo rm one great  par t  of  the  
speech  recogn i t ion .  They  concern  the m e c h a n i c a 1

lo Vowe l  reco~rni t ion based  on some se lec ted  vowe l  var iab les  
and  d i sc r iminant  ana lys i s .  
i 
The probab i l i ty  o f  cor rec t  ident i f i ca t ion  of  the 
acoust i ca l l y  c lose  German vowe l  phonemes  /i:  t It e:~ ~ t 
y:,  and  Y~ on the bas i s  o f  spect rograph ic  input  data  and  
tile d i sc r iminant  ana lys i s  ( l i te ra te  I, 2 rand  ~) was  ca lcu -  
la ted .  One male  speaker  were  used .  Fo l low ing  var iab les  were  
measured:  the f requenc ies  of  the four  f i r s t  fo rmants .  (F ie . .  
F~) I  the i r  ampl i tudes  (L le .eL~)  t the ampl i tude  Of  the zero  
(minimum) po int  between F1 and F2 (here ca l led  LZI)  and that 
between F2 and F3 (LZ2) t and the durat ion  of the vowels .  
The probab i l i ty  of correct  ident i f i ca t ion  was 94 per  
cent on average.  The h ighest  ident i f i ca t ion  probab i l i ty  
was shown by the phoneme /e : /  (98,9 ~) and the lowest  by 
the phoneme /Y/  (85~7 ~). The sounds were p icked  up f rom 
sentences read by the in formant .  
In the real  c lass i f i ca t ion  procedure  wh ich  was connec-  
ted to the probab i l i s t i c  recogn i t ion  program 6 ident i f i -  
cat ions were fa lse out of 103 poss ib le .  The order  of the 
s ign i f i cance  of the var iab les  s tud ied regard ing  the i r  
d i sc r iminatory  power  was F2 s LZI~ F1 t F~ s durat ion  s LI~ F3s 
L~ LZ21L3.  - One must  take into account  the poss ib i l i -  
ty that two var iab les  9 the d i sc r iminatory  power  of wh ich  
is good~ wi l l  corre late  w i th  each other.  In this case the 
bet ter  one is p laced  in a h igh pos i t ion  in the l ist  I but 
the other  one comes la ter  than its real  d i sc r iminatory  
power  impl ies~ because the cor re la t ion  is taken into ac-  
count.  I f  the bet ter  var iab le  was. not  considered~ the 
weaker  var iab le  wou ld  perhaps  take its p lace (if the 
cor re la t ion  is st rong enough).  This  may exp la in  the fact 
that F3 comes a f ter  F~ (the cor re la t ion  of F2 w i th  F3 is 
st rong concern ing  the vowels  s tudied) .  
The energy min imum between F1 and F2 (LZI) had a good 
d isc r iminatory  power.  This  showes that in the acoust i c  
s ignal  there can be cues~ wh ich  are ava i lab le  in the auto-  
mat ic  recogn i t ion  s such cues~ wh ich  need not  to be re levant  
for  percept ion  (cf. T i l lmann~ p. 1~9)? 
2. Recogn i t ion  based  on the d i sc r iminat ion  of the numer ica l  
models  o f  sounds .  
In  the  second exper iment  the  input  data  o f  the  recog-  
n i t ion  program cons is ted  o f  the  numer ica l  descr ibers  o f  the  
sounds .  They  were  fo rmed by  us ing  constant  po in ts  in  the  
measurement  of the spect rums of sounds.  Thus the descr iber  
of  a sound cons is ted  of  a ser ie of numbers~ wh ich  ind icated  
the ampl i tude  at constant  se lec ted  f requenc ies .  The  nar row 
f i l te r  (with 45 Hz bandwidth)  was  used  when produc ing  the 
sect ions  r wh ich  fo rmed the mater ia l  measured .  32 measure -  
ment  po in ts  ins ide  the range of ~ kHz  were  used.  
The descr ibers  for  330 F inn ish  sound man i fes ta t ions  
were calcula'ted. These  sounds were  representat ives  fo r  
8 short  F inn ish  vowe l  or  3 nasa l  phonemes  /a, e, i 0 o, u, 
y~ a r o r m r n, n/ .  30 representat ives  of every  phoneme 
type were  p icked  up f rom sentences  read  by a s ing le  male  
speaker .  
The data thus obta ined  were s tored  and submi t ted  
to the d i sc r iminat ing  ana lys i s .  The measurement  po in ts  were  
hand led  as var iab les .  
The probab i l i ty  of cor rect  recogn i t ion  was about  
60? . ?70  % on average.  One must  regard  r however  r that  the 
loca l i za t ion  of the sect ions  was (under c i rcumstances)  not  
very  exact  and the techn ica l  equ ipment  was unfor tunate ly  
not  the best  one. 
30 Recogn i t ion  based  on the numer ica l  mode ls  of sounds  and  
a spec ia l  recogn i t ion  program.. 
In the th i rd  recogn i t ion  exper iment  the F inn ish  
nasa l  sounds be long ing  to the phonemes  /n/  or  /m/ were  
t r ied to be c lass i f ied  automat ica l ly  on bas is  of  the 
numer ica l  descr ibers ,  wh ich  are d i scussed  in the pre fer r ing  
J 
chapter .  
F i r s t ly  the  f requency  area  o f  ~ kHz was  s tud ied  by  
means  o f  33 constant  measurement  po in ts  w i th  d i s tances  of  
121HZo The 'general '  descr ibers  for  /n /  and  /m/ were  ca lcu -  
la ted  by means  of  the PROGRAM I (below). 
The basic  mater ia l  cons is ted  of 87 wide  hand sect ions  
(made w i th  Kay  E lec t r i c  Co. Sound Sona-Graph mode l  6061-B)o  
The  sect ions  were  made f rom the ta rget  po in t  o f  F2  of  the  
nasa ls  in s ing le  words  (al l  poss ib le  enviroD-ments were  
cons idered) .  The  descr ibers  of  /n /  and  /m/ are  presented

Second ly  the numer ica l  descr ibers  were  res t r i c ted  so 
that  on ly  n ine  constant  measurement  po in ts  were  cons idered .  
The  n ine  po in ts  w i th  the best  d i sc r iminatory  power  were  
sought  by means  of the PROGRAM II (be low) .  
Th i rd ly  the 'genera l '  numer ica l  mode ls  fo r  the both  
phonemes  were  ca lcu la ted  on bas i s  of  the n ine  po in ts  
ment ioned .  The log ic  o f  the procedure  is descr ibed  shor t -  
ly  at  the beg inn ing  of  the program (PROGRAM I I I ) .  
Wi th  the same method  the numer ica l  mode l  of a new 
nasa l  sound was  ca lcu la ted  (PROGRAM I I I ) ,  and  the nasa l  
sound was  c lass i f ied  by  compa i r ing  i ts  mode l  w i th  the 
mean of  the mode ls  of  /n /  and  /m/ .  
The  main  idea  of  c lass i f i ca t ion  is that  the ampl i tudes  
at the n ine  measurement  po in ts  are  set  on  order  of  magn i -  
tude,  and  then  the i r  re la t ive  p laces  on the f requency  ax is  
a re  ind icated  by means  o f  the ord ina l  numbers  (nine poss i -  
b i l i t i es ) .  The  ord ina l  numbers  a re  then  p laced  one a f te r  
another9  so that  they  fo rm one s ing le  number .  Th is  number  
iis hand led  as the numer ica l  mode l  o f  a g roup  of nasa l  
sounds  or  a s ing le  nasa l  sound.  
The  c lass i f i ca t ion  t ime of  a sound by means  of  method  
descr ibed  here  is on ly  a f rac t ion  of  that  when us ing  the 
d i sc r iminat ion  ana lys~s .  
F ina l  comments  
Every  language needs  i ts  own recogn i t ion  program con-  
s i s t ing  of  subprograms~ wh ich  can be very  d i f fe rent .  That  
the recogn i t ion  program can  be worked  out  imp l ies  that  there  
is ~ suf f i c ient  amount  of  acoust i c  knowledge  about  the 
language in quest ion .  
It is poss ib le  that  the complete  speech  recogn i t ion  
doesn ' t  succeed  w i th  the  computers  ava i lab le~ so that  we 
must  wai te  so long  that  the b io log ica l  computers  a re  at
