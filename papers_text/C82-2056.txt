Any text  i s  const ruc ted  in  accordance with Imp l i c i t  
p r inc ip les  of semant ic  compress ion.  The paper a t tempts  to 
descr ibe  some of these  pr inc ip les .  
There are two main types of  text  semantic  compress ion:  
(1) the omiss ion of  "meaningfu l"  par ts ,  and (2) the omiss ion  
of  s tandard connect ions  among par ts  of  the text .  
1. The f i r s t  type of compress ion  i s  subd iv ided  in to :  
(a) omiss ion w i th in  a pred icat ion  (by a pred icat ion  i s  meant 
the s t ruc ture -  "pred icate  - P, i t s  aotants  - A") ,  and (b) 
omiss ion  of  the whole pred icat ion .  
&. In  spec ia l  cond i t ions  a par t  of  a p red icat ion  should 
be understood as the whole pred icat ion  in  accordance with 6 
basic rules+/: A -~AP, P -~AP, A...P -~AP, Ai...A j -~ 
-FAIPA j, A i -~AiPA j, A i ~A j -  
Examples. 
P -~ AP 
The patient was operated. -~ The patient was operated 
by surgeons. 
Ai...A j -~ AIPA j 
After t~e operation Nick feels good. -9 The operation 
was made on Nick.

most ruAea or most sentence grammars, should be not 
ob l igatory ,  but opt iona l .

b. The omiss ion of  a p red icat ion  i s  d iagnosed by the pre -  
sence of  another  p red icat ion  (PRj) ,  which i s  connected wi th  
the omit ted pred icat ion  (PR) by such re la t ions  ( j ) ' as  "ps~t"  
( inc lud ing  stsLrt ing,  in termed ia te  or  f ina l  po in t  or in terva l ) ,  
"a t t r ibute" ,  "accompazkTing", react ion" ,  "cause" ,  e tc .  ( the 
number of such re la t ions  seems not to  exceed 20).  In  such 
cases  the ~nderstanding of  the text  inc ludes  the ru le :  
PR~-~.  I~R. 
Examples.

ces of  the typhoon.  The roads and br idges  sure be ing re -

2. The omiss ion of  s tandard connect ions  among the par ts  
of  the text  can e i ther  be un iversa l  or  depend on the type of  
the text .  The texts  can be d iv ided  in to  two main ~p~cups- 
"phys ica l ly  o r iented"  and "menta l ly  o r iented" .  Roughly speak-  
ing ,  phys ica l ly  o r iented  texts  descr ibe  events  as they  occ - r  
and ~p~oup the events  in  accordance wi th  the i r  sequence,  wh i le  
menta l ly  o r iented  texts  descr ibe  the events  as they are re -  
f lec ted  in  the text  author  s mind and group the events  in to  
( ind iv idua l  or soc ia l l y  acknowledged) c lasses .  
an important  subc lass  of  (2) const i tu te  the cases  o f  "de-  
te rminat ing" .  We ca l l  a deteminer  a un i t  which re la tes  not 
only  to  i t s  immediate context ,  but to  snme la rger  p iece  of the 
text ,  up to the text  as the whole.  (Determinex~ can be e i ther  
man i fes ted  or omi t ted  in  the text . )  Let s compare two texts -  
( i )  Yesterday Nick went to  the theat re .  Today he i s  
going to the cinema. 
( i i )  Yesterday Nick went to  the theat re .  He met h i s  f r iends .  
On re turn ing  home they d i scussed  the pe~ox~n~nce.

In ( i )  the meaning "yesterday" relates only to one sentence, 
while in (ll) this meaning relates to the whole text. A piece 
of the text connected with a definite determiner is called 
ItJ "sphere of oper@tion". Along with constant determiners 
(such as one in text (ii)) there are variable determlners: 
their meaning is regularly changed while moving through the 
text (something like a co~ter). An ex~nple of a variable de- 
terminer is a sequence of predicate time markers in physically 
oriented texts, which usually are partially omitted and should 
be reconstructed during the text aualysis. 
To process a constant  determiner  i s  to f ind  i t s  sphere 
of operat ion ,  to process  a var iab le  determiner  i s ,  bes ides ,  
to  f ind  out a propor t iona l  change of i t s  meaning. 
The reconst ruct ion  of text  omiss ions demands us ing  d i f -  
fe rent  k inds of in fo rmat ion ,  among which an important  ro le  
belonsm to "c~inon-sense"  knowledge. This knowledge i s  d iT ided 
in to  genera l  ( typ ica l  re la t ions  of ob jec ts  and events )  and 
concrete .  The concrqte  knowledge i s  necessary ,  fo r  ins tance ,  
to maderstand such a sentence as Flamin~oes_bonos exp lora t ion  
Bhowe that  the are ~f the b i rds  i s  about 20 mi l l i on  years ,  
where the l ingu is t i c  meaning of the word ~ cont rad ic ts  the 
concrete  knowledge of the l i fe  l im i ts  of c reatures ,  which 
cause  the rereading of the sentense. 
Another in teres t ing  type of in fo rmat ion  needed i s  the 
in fo rmat ion  about a poss ib i l i ty  of a "sub~ect iTe" descr ip t ion  
(from the po in t  of Tiew of e i ther  the author  or the ob ject  
described) ?
