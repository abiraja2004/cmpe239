Abstract
This paper describes the Nara Institute of
Science and Technology (NAIST) native lan-
guage identification (NLI) system in the NLI
2013 Shared Task. We apply feature selec-
tion using a measure based on frequency for
the closed track and try Capping and Sampling
data methods for the open tracks. Our system
ranked ninth in the closed track, third in open
track 1 and fourth in open track 2.
1 Introduction
There have been many studies using English as a
second language (ESL) learner corpora. For exam-
ple, automatic grammatical error detection and cor-
rection is one of the most active research areas in this
field. More recently, attention has been paid to na-
tive language identification (NLI) (Brooke and Hirst,
2012; Bykh and Meurers, 2012; Brooke and Hirst,
2011; Wong and Dras, 2011; Wong et al, 2011).
Native language identification is the task of identi-
fying the ESL learner?s L1 given a learner?s essay.
The NLI Shared Task 2013 (Tetreault et al, 2013)
is the first shared task on NLI using the com-
mon dataset ?TOEFL-11? (Blanchard et al, 2013;
Tetreault et al, 2012). TOEFL-11 consists of essays
written by learners of 11 native languages (Arabic,
Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese,
Koran, Spanish, Telugu, Turkish), and it contains
1,100 essays for each native language. In addition,
the essay topics are balanced, and the number of top-
ics is 8.
In the closed track, we tackle feature selection
for increasing accuracy. We use a feature selection
method based on the frequency of each feature (e.g.,
document frequency, TF-IDF).
In the open tracks, to address the problem of im-
balanced data, we tried two approaches: Capping
and Sampling data in order to balance the size of
training data.
In this paper, we describe our system and exper-
imental results. Section 2 describes the features we
used in the system for NLI. Section 3 and Section 4
describe the systems for closed track and open track
in NLI Shared Task 2013. Section 5 describes the re-
sults for NLI Shared Task 2013. Section 6 describes
the experimental result for 10-fold cross validation
on the data set used by Tetreault et al (2012).
2 Features used in all tracks
In this section, we describe the features in our sys-
tems. We formulate NLI as a multiclass classifica-
tion task. Following previous work, we use LIB-
LINEAR 2 for the classification tool and tune the C
parameter using grid-search.
We select the features based on previous work
(Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Tetreault et al, 2012). All
features used are binary. We treated the features as
shown in Table 1. The example of features in Table
1 shows the case whose input is ?I think not a really
difficult question?.
We use a special symbol for the beginning and
end of sentence (or word) for bigrams and trigrams.
For surface forms, we lowercased all words. POS,
POS-function and dependency features are extracted

using the Stanford Parser 2.0.2 3.
We use tree substitution grammars as fea-
tures. TSGs are generalized context-free grammars
(CFGs) that allow nonterminals to re-write to tree
fragments. The fragments reflect both syntactic and
surface structures of a given sentence more effi-
ciently than using several CFG rules. In practice,
efficient Bayesian approaches have been proposed
in prior work (Post and Gildea, 2009). In terms
of the application of TSG to NLI task, (Swanson
and Charniak, 2012) have shown a promising re-
sult. Post (2011) also uses TSG to judge grammat-
icality of a sentence written by language learners.
With these previous findings in mind, we also ex-
tract TSG rules. We use the training settings and
public software from Post (2011)4, obtaining 21,020
unique TSG fragments from the training dataset of
the TOEFL-11 corpus.
3 Closed Track
In this section, we describe our system for the closed
track. We use the tools and features described in
Section 2.
In our system, feature selection is performed us-
ing a measure based on frequency. Although Tsur
3http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml
4https://github.com/mjpost/post2011judging
and Rappoport (2007) used TF-IDF, they use it to
decrease the influence of topic bias rather than for
increasing accuracy. Brooke and Hirst (2012) used
document frequency for feature selection, however
it does not affect accuracy.
We use the native language frequency (hereafter
we refer to this as NLF). NLF is the number of na-
tive languages a feature appears in. Thus, NLF takes
values from 1 to 11. Figure 1 shows an example of
NLF. The word bigram feature ?in Japan? appears
only in essays of which the learners? native language
is Japanese, therefore the NLF is 1.
The assumption behind using this feature is that a
feature which appears in all native languages affects
NLI less, while a feature which appears in few na-
tive language affects NLI more. The features whose
NLFs are 11 include e.g. ?there are?, ?PRP VBP?
and ?a JJ NN?. Table 2 shows some examples of the
features appearing in only 1 native language in the
TOEFL-11 corpus. The features include place-name
or company name such as ?tokyo?, ?korea?, ?sam-
sung?, which are certainly specific for some native
language.

4 Open tracks
4.1 Lang-8 corpus
For the open tracks, we used Lang-8 as a source to
create a learner corpus tagged with the native lan-
guages of learners. Lang-8 is a language learning
social networking service. 5 Users write articles
in their non-native languages and native speakers
correct them. We used all English articles written
through the end of 2012. We removed all sentences
which contain non-ASCII characters. 6
Almost all users register their native language on
the site. We regard users? registered native language

for correctors? reference.
as the gold label for each article. We split the learner
corpus extracted from Lang-8 into sub-corpora by
the native languages. The numbers of articles in all
corpora are summarized in Table 3. Unfortunately,
some sub-corpora are too small to train the model.
For example, the Telugu corpus has only 19 articles.
In order to balance the size of the training data,
we tried two approaches: Capping and Sampling.
We confirmed in preliminary experiments that the
model with these approaches work better than the
model with the original sized data.
Capping
In this approach, we limit the size of a sub-corpus
for training to N articles. For a sub-corpus which
contains over N articles, we randomly extract ar-
ticles up to N . We set N = 5000 and adapt this
approach for Run 1 and Run 3 in the open tracks.
Sampling
In this approach, we equalize the size of all sub-
corpora. For corpora which contain less than N ar-
ticles, we randomly copy articles until their size be-
comesN . We setN = 5000 and adapt this approach
for Run 2 and Run 4 in the open tracks.
4.2 Models
We compared two approaches with baseline features
and all features.
The models in Run 1 and Run 3 were trained with
the data created by the Capping approach, and the
models in Run 2 and Run 47 were trained by the
Sampling approach.
We used only word N-grams (N = 1, 2) as base-
line features. As extra features we used the follow-
ing features.
7We did not have time to train the model for Run 4 in the
open 1 track.

In open track 2, we also add the TOEFL-11
dataset to the training data for all runs.
5 Result for NLI shared Task 2013
Table 4 shows the results of our systems for NLI
Shared Task. Chance accuracy is 0.09. All results
outperform random guessing.
5.1 Closed track
In the closed track, we submitted 5 runs. Run 1
is the system using only word 1,2-grams features.
Run 2 is the system using all features with NLF fea-
ture selection (1 < NLF < 11). Run 3 is the system
using word 1,2-grams and POS 2,3-grams features.
Run 4 is the system using word 1,2-grams, POS 2,3-
grams, character 2,3-grams and dependency features
without parameter tuning. Run 5 is the system us-
ing word 1,2-grams without parameter tuning. The
method using the feature selection method we pro-
posed achieved the best performance of our systems.
5.2 Open tracks
Comparison of the two data balancing
approaches
In open track 1, the method of ?Sampling? out-
performs that of ?Capping? (Run 2 > Run 1). This
means even duplicated training data can improve the
performance.
On the other hand, in open track 2, ?Capping?
works better than ?Sampling? (Run 1 > Run 2 and
Run 3>Run 4). In the first place, the models trained
with both Lang-8 data and TOEFL data do not per-
form better than ones trained with only TOEFL data.
This means the less Lang-8 data we use, the better
performance we obtain.
Comparison on two feature sets
In open track 1, adding extra features seems to
have a bad influence because the result of Run 3
is worse than that of Run 1. This may be because
Lang-8 data is out of domain of the test corpus
(TOEFL).

Run1 with the same output as Run2.
In open track 2, adding extra features makes the
performance better (Run 3 > Run 1, Run 4 > Run
2). In-domain TOEFL data seem to be effective for
training with extra features. In order to improve the
result with extra features in open track 2, domain
adaptation may be effective.
6 Experiment and Result for 10 fold
Cross-Validation
We conducted an experiment using 10-fold cross
validation on the data set used by Tetreault et al
(2012). Table 5 shows the results for different fea-
ture set. The table consists of 3 blocks; the first
block is results of the system using 1 feature, the
second block is the result of the system using word
1,2-grams feature and another feature, and the third
block is the result of the system using word 1,2-
grams and more features.
In the first block results, the system using the
word 1,2-grams feature achieved 0.8075. It is the
highest accuracy in the first block, and third highest
accuracy in the results of Table 5. From the second
block of results, adding an extra feature does not im-
prove accuracy, however in the third block the sys-
tems in (14) and (15) outperform the system using
only word 1,2-grams.
Table 6 shows the results of using feature selec-
tion by NLF. The table consists of 3 blocks; the
first block is the results of the system using features
whose NLF is smaller than N (N = 11, 10, 9, 8), the
second block is the results of the system using fea-
tures whose NLF is greater than N (N = 1, 2, 3, 4),
and the third block is the results of the system using
features whose NLF is smaller than 11 and greater
than N (N = 1, 2, 3, 4).
The best accuracy is achieved by excluding fea-

Table 5: 10-fold cross validation results for each

tures whose NLF is 1 or 11. While the results of the
first block and the second block are intuitive, the re-
sults of the third block are not (looking at the second
block of Table 6, excluding features whose NLF is
greater than N (1, 2, 3, 4) reduces accuracy). One
possible explanation is that features whose NLF is
1 includes features that rarely appear in the training
corpus.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we described our systems for the NLI
Shared Task 2013. We tried feature selection using
native language frequency for the closed track and
Capping and the Sampling data to balance the size of
training data for the open tracks. The feature selec-
tion we proposed improves the performance for NLI.
The system using our feature selection achieved
0.817 on the test data of NLI Shared Task and 0.821
using 10-fold cross validation. While the Sampling
system outperformed Capping system for open track
1, the Capping system outperformed Sampling sys-
tem in open track 2 (because it reduced the amount
of out of domain data).
