ABSTRACT 
This paper proposes a system of map- 
ping classes of syntact ic  structures as 
instruments for automatic text under- 
standing. The system i l lustrated in Japa- 
nese consists of a set of verb classes and 
information on mapping them together with 
noun phrases, tense and aspect. The sys- 
tem. having information on direct ion of 
possible inferences between the verb 
classes with information on tense and as- 
pect, is supposed to be ut i l ized for rea- 
soning in automatic text understanding. 
I .  INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this paper is to pro- 
pose a system of mapping classes of syn- 
tactic structures as instruments for auto- 
matic text understanding. The system con- 
sists of a set of verb classes and Jnfor- 
matlon on mapping them together with noun 
phrases, tense and aspect, and \]s supposed 
to he ut i l ized for inference in automatic 
text understanding. 
The language used  fo r  i l l us t ra t ion  o f  
the  sys tem i s  Japanese .  
There Is a tendency for non-syntact ic  
analysers and semant ic  grammars In auto- 
matic text understanding. However. this 
proposal Is motivated by the fact that 
syntact ic  structures, once analyzed and 
classi f ied in terms of semant ic  related- 
ness, provide much information for" under- 
standing. This is supported by the fact 
that human beings use syntact ica l ly  re- 
lated sentences when they ask questions 
about texts. 
The system we are proposing has the 
fol lowing elements: 
1) Verb classes. 
2) Mapping of noun phrases between 
or among some verb  classes. 
3) Direct ion of possib le infel'ence 
between the classes with information on 
tense and aspect. 
Our experiment, in which subjects are 
asked to make true-false quest ions about 
certain texts, revealed that native speak- 
ers think that they understand texts by 
deduct ing sentences lexical ly or semanti -  
cally related. For instance, a human being 
relates quest ions such as 'Did Mary go to 
a theater?' to a sentence in texts such as 
'John took Mary to a theater.' Or, by the 
same sentence, he understands that 'Mary 
was in the theater." 
II. FEATURES OF THE JAPANESE SYNTAX 
Features of ,Japanese syntax relevant 
to the d iscuss ion in this paper are pre- 
sented below. 
The sentence usual ly ha:# case mark- 
ings as postposi t ions to noun phrases. For 
i ns tance .  
I. John qa Mary D_J_ himitsu o hanashita 
'John told a secret to  Mary.' 
In  sentence  1. postpos i t ions  ga .  n i  and 
o ind icate  nominat ive ,  dat ive  alld accusa-  
t i ve .  respect ive ly .  
409 
However .  postpos J t ions  do not  un ique-  
{y map to  deep  cases .  Take the  fo l low i t lg  
sentences  fo r  example .  
2.  John  ~ia_ san i i  B i_ i t ta .  
" John  went  at  :? o ' c io ( -k . '  
3 .  John  w_a Tokyo  r ! t  i t ta .  
" John  ~,~'ellt to  Tokyo . "  
4 .  Johr~ w;~ Tokyo  ILI :~unde i ru .  
' J ohn  l i ves  in  Tokyo . '  
Ni in the sentences 2, 3. 4 indicate time. 
goal and locat ion,  respect ive ly .  This is 
due to  the verb  ca |egory  (3  and  41 OF the 
c lass  of  noun phrases  (2 and 31 appear ing  
in  each  sentence .  
Certain mor'phemc classes hide the 
casemark ing. e.g. 
5. John  ~Q i t ta .  
"John a lso  went (y;omewhere). 
6. Tokyo mo i t ta .  
'Someone went to  Tokyo also.' 
The mo in sentence 5 and 6 means 'a l so ' .  
Therefore these sentences are derived from 
d i f fe rent  syntact i ca l  const ruct ions ,  that 
i s .  sentences 7 and 8. respect ive ly .  
7. John ga i t ta .  
"John went (somewhere).'  
8. Tokyo  n__ki i t ta .  
? Someone went  to  Tokyo . "  
Furthermore. as i l l us t ra ted  in sen- 
tences 5 through 6, noun phrases ,lay be 
deleted f ree ly ,  provided the context 
gives fu l l  information. In sentences 6 and 
7. a noun phrase ind icat ing the goal is 
missing and sentences 6 and 8 lack thal  
ind icat ing the sub jec t .  F ina l ly .  there 
are  many pa i rs  o f  lex ica lLy  re la ted  verbs ,  
tz'ansi t i re  and inst\] a~it i re,  indicat ing 
the :;ame phenomenon d i f fe rent ly  
9. John ga t,4ary ni hon  o m_!seta .  
",h)hn showed a hook to  Mary.  
10. Mal'y ga hon o !~ i ta .  
"Uary  saw a book . '  
The two expressions, or viewpoints,  on the 
same phenomenon, that is, 'John showed to 
Mary a book which she saw.' are related 
in Japanese by the verb root ~_l. 
The system under considerat ion uti- 
lizes some of the above features (case 
marking and lexical ly related verbs) and 
in turn can be used to ease di f f icul t ies 
of automatic understanding,  caused by some 
other features (case hiding, ambiguious 
case marking and de let ion  of  noun 
phrases . )  
I I I .  VERB CLASS 
The system is i l l us t ra ted  below with 
verbs re la ted  to the notion of movement. 
The verb c lasses  in th i s  category are as 
fo l lows :  
(1 )  Verb class of causal i ty of 
movementtCM) 
Examples:tsureteiku ' to  take (a 
person)' 
tsuretekuru 'to bring (a 
person)" 
hakobu 'to carry" 
yaru 'to give" 
oshieru "to tell' 
Verbs of th i s  c lass  indicate that  someone 
causes something or someone moves. How to 
move varies as seen later. 
(2) Verb c lass  of movement(MV) 
Examples:iku " to  go' 
kuru  ' to  come"  
idousuru "to move" 
Verbs of  th i s  c lass  indicated that some- 
th ing or someone moves from one place to 
another. 
(3) Verb class of existence(EX) 
Examples:iru ' (animate) be" 
aru "(inanimate) be' 
Verbs of th i s  c lass  indicate the ex istence 
of something or someone. 
410 
(4) Verb class o f  possess lon(PS)  
Examples:motsu ' to  possess' 
kau 'to keep' 
Verbs of this class indicate someone's 
possession of something or someone. 
the case s lo t .  As seen below, the differ- 
ence between yaru, 'to give' and uru, 'to 
sell' is that the latter has 'money' as 
instrument, whi le the former does not. In- 
cidentally, J apanese  has  a verb  yuzuru  
wh ich  can  be  used  whether  the  ins t ruh~ent  
Is money o r  not .  
Not i ce  that  the  fundamenta l  not ion  o f  
MOVE here  i s  much w ider  than  the  normal  
mean ing  o f  the  word 'move ' .  When someone 
learns  some idea  f rom someone else. i t  is 
unders tood  that  an abst rac t  not ion  moves 
f rom the  fo rmer  to  the  la t te r .

inference would be possible among sen- 
tences II through 14 in automatic text un- 
derstanding. Furthermore. th is  system can 
also be u t i l i zed  in the automatic text 
understanding by locating missing noun 
phrases and determining ambiguous grammat- 
ical cases in the sentence, f inding seman- 
t i ca l l y  re lated sentences between the 
questions and the text ,  and gathering the 
r ight semantic information. 
By the~ie condit ions, the mapping of 
syntact ic  s t ructures  presented in Diagram 
II is transformed to that in terms of in- 
dividual verbs. Furthermore, rules of d i -  
rect ions fo r  reasoning presented in  D ia -  
gram IV connect  spec i f i c  sentences. 
Take the fo l low ing  sentence  fo r  example .  
Since th is  system uses information on
syntact ic  s t ruc tures ,  i t  is much simpler 
in terms of the semantic s t ructures  than 
the Conceptual Dependencey Model, for in- 
stance, and the mapping among the sentence 
patterns semantical ly re lated much more 
exp l i c i t .
