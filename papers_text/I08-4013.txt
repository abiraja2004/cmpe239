Abstract 
Chinese word segmentation (CWS), named 
entity recognition (NER) and part-of-
speech tagging is the lexical processing in 
Chinese language. This paper describes the 
work on these tasks done by France Tele-
com Team (Beijing) at the fourth Interna-
tional Chinese Language Processing Bake-
off. In particular, we employ Conditional 
Random Fields with different features for 
these tasks. In order to improve NER rela-
tively low recall; we exploit non-local fea-
tures and alleviate class imbalanced distri-
bution on NER dataset to enhance the re-
call and keep its relatively high precision. 
Some other post-processing measures such 
as consistency checking and transforma-
tion-based error-driven learning are used to 
improve word segmentation performance. 
Our systems participated in most CWS and 
POS tagging evaluations and all the NER 
tracks. As a result, our NER system 
achieves the first ranks on MSRA open 
track and MSRA/CityU closed track. Our 
CWS system achieves the first rank on 
CityU open track, which means that our 
systems achieve state-of-the-art perform-
ance on Chinese lexical processing. 
1 Introduction 
Different from most European languages, there is 
no space to mark word boundary between Chinese 
characters, so Chinese word segmentation (CWS) 
is the first step for Chinese language processing. 
From another point that there is no capitalization 
information to indicate entity boundary, which 
makes Chinese named entity recognition (NER) 
more difficult than European languages. And part-
of-speech tagging (POS tagging) provides valuable 
information for deep language processing such as 
parsing, semantic role labeling and etc. This paper 
presents recent research progress on CWS, NER 
and POS tagging done by France Telecom Team 
(Beijing). Recently, Conditional Random Fields1 
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001) have been success-
fully employed in various natural language proc-
essing tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art per-
formance, in our system, we use it as the basic 
framework and incorporate some other post-
processing measures for CWS, NER and POS tag-
ging tasks.  
2 Chinese Named Entity Recognition 
NER is always limited by its lower recall due to 
the imbalanced distribution where the NONE class 
dominates the entity classes. Classifiers built on 
such dataset typically have a higher precision and a 
lower recall and tend to overproduce the NONE

class (Kambhatla, 2006). Taking SIGHAN Bakeoff 
2006 (Levow, 2006) as an example, the recall is 
lower about 5% than the precision for each submit-
ted system on MSRA and CityU closed track. If we 
could improve NER recall but keep its relatively 
high precision, the overall F-measure will be im-
proved as a result. We design two kinds of effec-
tive features: 0/1 features and non-local features to 
achieve this objective. Our final systems utilize 
these features together with the local features to 
perform NER task. 
2.1 Local Features 
The local features are character-based and are in-
stantiated from the following temples: 
Unigram: Cn (n=-2,-1, 0, 1, 2). 
Bigram: CnCn+1 (n=-2,-1, 0, 1) and C-1C1. 
Where C0 is the current character, C1 the next 
character, C2 the second character after C0, C-1 the 
character preceding C0, and C-2 the second charac-
ter before C0.  
2.2 0/1 Features 
In order to alleviate the imbalanced class distribu-
tion, we assign 1 to all the characters which are 
labeled as entity and 0 to all the characters which 
are labeled as NONE in training data. In such way, 
the class distribution can be alleviated greatly, tak-
ing Bakeoff 2006 MSRA NER training data for 
example, if we label the corpus with 10 classes, the 
class distribution is 0.81(B-PER):1.70(B-LOC):0.95(B-
ORG):0.81(I-PER):0.88(I-LOC):2.87(I-ORG):0.76(E-
PER):1.42(E-LOC):0.94(E-ORG):88.86(NONE), if we 
change the label scheme to 2 labels (0/1), the class 
distribution is 11.14 (entity):88.86(NONE). We 
train the 0/1 CRFs tagger using the local features 
alone. For the 0/1 features, during the training 
stage, they are assigned with 2-fold cross valida-
tion, and during the testing stage, they are assigned 
with the 0/1 tagger.  
2.3 Non-local Features 
Most empirical approaches including CRFs cur-
rently employed in NER task make decision only 
on local context for extract inference, which is 
based on the data independent assumption. But 
often this assumption does not hold because non-
local dependencies are prevalent in natural lan-
guage (including the NER task). How to utilize the 
non-local dependencies is a key issue in NER task. 
Up to now, few researches have been devoted to 
this issue; existing works mainly focus on using 
the non-local information for improving NER label 
consistency (Krishnan and Manning, 2006). There 
are two methods to use non-local information. One 
is to add additional edges to graphical model struc-
ture to represent the distant dependencies and the 
other is to encode the non-locality with non-local 
features. In the first approach, heuristic rules are 
used to find the dependencies (Bunescu and 
Mooney, 2004) or penalties for label inconsistency 
are required to handset ad-hoc (Finkel et al, 2005). 
Furthermore, high computational cost is spent for 
approximate inference. In order to establish the 
long dependencies easily and overcome the disad-
vantage of the approximate inference, Krishnan 
and Manning (2006) propose a two-stage approach 
using CRFs framework with extract inference. 
They represent the non-locality with non-local fea-
tures, and extract them from the output of the first 
stage CRF with local context alone; then they in-
corporate the non-local features into the second 
CRF. But the features in this approach are only 
used to improve label consistency in European 
languages. Similar with their work encoding the 
non-local information with non-local feature, and 
we also exploit the non-local features under two-
stage architecture. Different from their features are 
activated on the recognized entities coming from 
the first CRF, the non-local features we design are 
used to recall more missed entities which are seen 
in the training data or unseen entities but some of 
their occurrences being recognized correctly in the 
first stage, so our non-local features are activated 
on the raw character sequence.  
Different NER in European languages, where 
entity semantic classification is more difficult 
compared with boundary detection, in Chinese, the 
situation is opposite.  So we encode different use-
ful information for Chinese NER two subtasks: 
entity boundary detection and entity semantic clas-
sification. Three kinds of non-local features are 
designed; they are fired on the token sequences if 
they are matched with certain entity in the entity 
list in forward maximum matching (FMM) way. 
Token-position features (NF1): These refer to 
the position information (start, middle and last) 
assigned to the token sequence which is matched 
with the entity list exactly. These features enable 
us to capture the dependencies between the identi-
cal candidate entities and their boundaries.

Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
Entity-majority features (NF2): These refer to 
the majority label assigned to the token sequence 
which is matched with the entity list exactly. These 
features enable us to capture the dependencies be-
tween the identical entities and their classes, so 
that the same candidate entities of different occur-
rences can be recalled favorably, and their label 
consistencies can be considered too. 
Token-position & entity-majority features 
(NF3): These features capture non-local informa-
tion from NF1 and NF2 simultaneously. They take 
into account the entity boundary and semantic 
class information at the same time. 
Figure 1 shows the flow of using non-local fea-
tures under CRFs framework in two-stage architec-
ture. The first CRF is trained with local features 
alone, and then we test the testing data with the 
first CRF and get the entities plus their type from 
the output. The second CRF utilizes the 0/1 fea-
tures and the non-local features derived from the 
entity list which is merged by the output of the first 
CRF from the testing data and the entities extracted 
directly from the training data. We compare the 
three kinds of non-local features on MSRA and 
CityU closed track in SIGHAN 2006 and we find 
that the NF3 is the best (Mao etc, 2007). So we 
only incorporate the NF3 into our final NER sys-
tem.

2.4 Results 
We employ BIOE1 label scheme for the NER task 
because we found it performs better than IOB2 on 
Bakeoff 2006 (Levow, 2006) NER MSRA and 
CityU corpora. Table 1 presents the official results 
on the MSRA and CityU corpus. The F-measure 
on MSRA open track is so high just because the 
testing data in Bakeoff 2007 is part of its Bakeoff 
2006 training dataset and we utilize this corpus for 
training the final CRFs classifier. The F-measure 
on CityU open track is not much superior to its 
closed track because we only use its Bakeoff 2006 
corpus to train the 0/1 CRFs, but not use the Bake-
off 2006 corpus to train final classifier.

Table 2 lists the features we used in our CWS sys-

two other post-processing measures are performed. 
We utilize transformation-based error-driven learn-
ing (TBL)2 to further improve CWS and perform 
consistency checking among different occurrences 
of a particular character sequence. For TBL, we 
use the template defined in (He et al). Our CWS 
system participate almost all the tracks and table 3 
lists the official results.

http://nlp.cs.jhu.edu/~rflorian/fntbl/index.html

Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
TBL is performed after consistency checking is 
done. We make a mistake on cityu_c_b because we 
rename cityu_c_a as cityu_c_b, so the two results 
are the same, after we correct the mistake and 
score again; we achieve an F-measure of 94.31%. 
In the closed tracks, we first train initial CRFs 
with 3-fold cross-validation; then we test the train-
ing data (three parts) with the three trained CRFs, 
we train the TBL learner on the training data com-
pared it with the testing result from the initial 
CRFs. The consistency checking is inspired by (Ng 
and Low, 2004). Table 4 lists the corpus used to 
train the CRFs and TBL learner in the open tracks.

CKIP 2007 2006 
CTB 2006,2007 2007 
Table 4. Corpora used to train the CRFs classi-
fier and the TBL learner 
 
In the open track, we collect the consistency list 
from all its correspondent Bakeoff corpora, the 
gazetteer extract from People Daily 2000 and idi-
oms, slang from GKB. From the table 3 in the 
closed test, we can confirm that TBL may not im-
prove CWS performance, while in most cases, per-
formance will surely draw back. The reason lies in 
the fact that the learning capability of CRFs is su-
perior to that of TBL, if they are trained with the 
same corpus, TBL may modify some correctly tags 
by CRFs. This can be seen from Table 3 that re-
sults without TBL (in run (a)) are almost superior 
to that with TBL (in run (b)).  
4 Part-of-speech Tagging 
For POS tagging task, apart from the local features 
same as used in NER, two other features are de-
signed to improve the performance. 
? Ambiguous part-of-speech: this feature is 
true when the word has more than 2 kinds 
of part-of-speech. 
? Major part-of-speech: The feature is as-
signed as the major part-of-speech for any 
word. We do not assign the value to the 
new words. 
Table 5 shows the performance in the closed 
tracks. Because we only used the simple features 
and do not process the unknown word specially, 
our performance is not satisfactory.
