Abstract
In this paper, we describe a source-
side reordering method based on syntac-
tic chunks for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation. First, we shallow parse
the source language sentences. Then, re-
ordering rules are automatically learned
from source-side chunks and word align-
ments. During translation, the rules are
used to generate a reordering lattice for
each sentence. Experimental results are
reported for a Chinese-to-English task,
showing an improvement of 0.5%?1.8%
BLEU score absolute on various test sets
and better computational efficiency than
reordering during decoding. The exper-
iments also show that the reordering at
the chunk-level performs better than at the
POS-level.
1 Introduction
In machine translation, reordering is one of the ma-
jor problems, since different languages have differ-
ent word order requirements. Many reordering con-
straints have been used for word reorderings, such
as ITG constraints (Wu, 1996), IBM constraints
(Berger et al, 1996) and local constraints (Kanthak
et al, 2005). These approaches do not make use of
any linguistic knowledge.
Several methods have been proposed to use syn-
tactic information to handle the reordering problem,
e.g. (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea,
2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004;
Galley et al, 2006). One approach makes use of
bitext grammars to parse both the source and tar-
get languages. Another approach makes use of syn-
tactic information only in the target language. Note
that these models have radically different structures
and parameterizations than phrase-based models for
SMT.
Another kind of approaches is to use syntactic in-
formation in rescoring methods. (Koehn and Knight,
2003) apply a reranking approach to the sub-task
of noun-phrase translation. (Och et al, 2004) and
(Shen et al, 2004) describe the use of syntactic fea-
tures in reranking the output of a full translation sys-
tem, but the syntactic features give very small gains.
In this paper, we present a strategy to reorder
a source sentence using rules based on syntactic
chunks. It is possible to integrate reordering rules di-
rectly into the search process, but here, we consider
a more modular approach: easy to exchange reorder-
ing strategy. To avoid hard decisions before SMT,
we generate a source-reordering lattice instead of a
single reordered source sentence as input to the SMT
system. Then, the decoder uses the reordered source
language model as an additional feature function. A
language model trained on the reordered source-side
chunks gives a score for each path in the lattice. The
novel ideas in this paper are:
? reordering of the source sentence at the chunk
level,
? representing linguistic chunks-reorderings in a
lattice.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents a review of related work. In Sec-
tions 3, we review the phrase-based translation sys-
tem used in this work and propose the framework
of the new reordering method. In Section 4, we in-
troduce the details of the reordering rules, how they
are defined and how to extract them. In Section 5,
we explain how to apply the rules and how to gen-
erate reordering lattice. In Section 6, we present
some results that show that the chunk-level source
reordering is helpful for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation. Finally, we conclude this paper
and discuss future work in Section 7.
2 Related Work
Beside the reordering methods during decoding, an
alternative approach is to reorder the input source
sentence to match the word order of the target sen-
tence.
Some reordering methods are carried out on syn-
tactic source trees. (Collins et al, 2005) describe
a method for reordering German for German-to-
English translation, where six transformations are
applied to the surface string of the parsed source
sentence. (Xia and McCord, 2004) propose an ap-
proach for translation from French-to-English. This
approach automatically extracts rewrite patterns by
parsing the source and target sides of the training
corpus. These rewrite patterns can be applied to any
input source sentence so that the rewritten source
and target sentences have similar word order. Both
methods need a parser to generate trees of source
sentences and are applied only as a preprocessing
step.
Another kind of source reordering methods be-
sides full parsing is based on Part-Of-Speech (POS)
tags or word classes. (Costa-jussa` and Fonollosa,
2006) view the source reordering as a translation
task that translate the source language into a re-
ordered source language. Then, the reordered source
sentence is taken as the single input to the standard
SMT system.
(Chen et al, 2006) automatically extract rules
from word alignments. These rules are defined at
the POS level and the scores of matching rules are
used as additional feature functions during rescor-
ing. (Crego and Marin?o, 2006) integrate source-side
reordering into SMT decoding. They automatically
learn rewrite patterns from word alignment and rep-
resent the patterns with POS tags. To our knowledge
no work is reported on the reordering with shallow
parsing.
Decoding lattices were already used in (Zens et
al., 2002; Kanthak et al, 2005). Those approaches
used linguistically uninformed word-level reorder-
ings.
3 System Overview
In this section, we will describe the phrase-based
SMT system which we use for the experiments.
Then, we will give an outline of the extentions with
the chunk-level source reordering model.
3.1 The Baseline Phrase-based SMT System
In statistical machine translation, we are given a
source language sentence fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ ,
which is to be translated into a target language sen-
tence eI1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Among all possible tar-
get language sentences, we will choose the sentence
with the highest probability:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1|fJ1 )
} (1)
= argmax
I,eI1
{
Pr(eI1) ? Pr(fJ1 |eI1)
} (2)
This decomposition into two knowledge sources
is known as the source-channel approach to sta-
tistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1990).
It allows an independent modeling of the target
language model Pr(eI1) and the translation model
Pr(fJ1 |eI1). The target language model describes
the well-formedness of the target language sentence.
The translation model links the source language sen-
tence to the target language sentence. The argmax
operation denotes the search problem, i.e., the gen-
eration of the output sentence in the target language.
A generalization of the classical source-channel
approach is the direct modeling of the posterior
probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ). Using a log-linear model
2
(Och and Ney, 2002), we obtain:
Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) =
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
)
?
I?,e?I?1
exp
(
?M
m=1 ?mhm(e?I
?
1 , fJ1 )
)
(3)
The denominator represents a normalization factor
that depends only on the source sentence fJ1 . There-
fore, we can omit it during the search process. As a
decision rule, we obtain:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{ M
?
m=1
?mhm(eI1, fJ1 )
}
(4)
The log-linear model has the advantage that addi-
tional models h(?) can be easily integrated into the
overall system. The model scaling factors ?M1 are
trained according to the maximum entropy principle,
e.g., using the GIS algorithm. Alternatively, one can
train them with respect to the final translation quality
measured by an error criterion (Och, 2003).
The log-linear model is a natural framework to in-
tegrate many models. The baseline system uses the
following models:
? phrase translation model
? phrase count features
? word-based translation model
? word and phrase penalty
? target language model (6-gram)
? distortion model (assigning costs based on the
jump width)
All the experiments in the paper are evaluated with-
out rescoring. More details about the baseline sys-
tem can be found in (Mauser et al, 2006)
3.2 Source Sentence Reordering Framework
Encouraged by the work of (Xia and McCord, 2004)
and (Crego and Marin?o, 2006), we also reorder the
source language side. Compared to reordering on
the target language side, one advantage is the effi-
ciency since the reordering lattice can be translated
monotonically as in (Zens et al, 2002). Another ad-
vantage is that there is correct sentence information

for the reordering methods, because the source sen-
tences are always given. Syntactic reordering on tar-
get language is difficult, since the methods will de-
grade much because of the errors in hypothesis.
We apply reordering at the syntactic chunk level
which can been seen as an intermediate level be-
tween full parsing and POS tagging. Figure 1 shows
the differences between the new translation frame-
work and the standard translation process. A re-
ordering lattice replaces the original source sentence
as the input to the translation system. The use of a
lattice avoids hard decisions before translation. To
generate the reordering lattice, the source sentence is
first POS tagged and chunk parsed. Then, reorder-
ing rules are applied to the chunks to generate the
reordering lattice.
Reordering rules are the key information for
source reordering. They are automatically learned
from the training data. The details of these two mod-
ules will be introduced in Section 5.
4 Reordering Rules
There has been much work on learning and apply-
ing reordering rules on source language, such as
(Nie?en and Ney, 2001; Xia and McCord, 2004;
Collins et al, 2005; Chen et al, 2006; Crego and
Marin?o, 2006; Popovic? and Ney, 2006). The re-
ordering rules could be composed of words, POS
tags or syntactic tags of phrases. In our work, a rule
is composed of chunk tags and POS tags. There is

and POS tag sequence, rhs: permutation )
no. lhs rhs

2. NP0 PP1 u2 n3 3 0 1 2

no hierarchical structure in a rule.
4.1 Definition of Reordering Rules
First, we show some rule examples in Table 1. A re-
ordering rule consists of a left-hand-side (lhs) and a
right-hand-side (rhs). The left-hand-side is a syn-
tactic rule (chunk or POS tags), while the right-
hand-side is the reordering positions of the rule. Dif-
ferent rules can share the same left-hand-side, such
as rules no. 1, 2 and no. 3, 4. The rules record
not only the real reordered chunk sequence, but also
the monotone chunk sequences, like no. 1, 3 and
5. Note that the same tag sequence can appear mul-
tiple times according to different contexts, such as
DNP0 NP1 m2 # 0 1 2 in rules no. 5, 6, 7.
4.2 Extraction of Reordering Rules
The extraction of reordering rules is based on the
word alignment and the source sentence chunks.
Here, we train word alignments in both directions
with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). To get algn-
ment with high accuracy, we use the intersection
alignment here.
For a given word-aligned sentence pair
(fJ1 , eI1, aJ1 ), the source word sequence fJ1 is
first parsed into a chunk sequence FK1 . Accord-
ingly, the word-to-word alignment aJ1 is changed
to a chunk-to-word alignment a?K1 which is the
combination of the target words aligned to the
source words in a chunk. It is defined as:
a?k = {i|i = aj ? j ? [jk, jk+1 ? 1]}
Figure 2: Illustration of three kinds of phrases:
(a)monotone phrase, (b)reordering phrase, (c)cross
phrase. The black box is a word-to-word alignment.
The gray box is a chunk-to-word alignment.
Here, jk denotes the position of the first source word
in kth chunk. The new alignment is 1 : m from
source chunks to target words. It also means a?k is a
set of positions of target words.
We apply the standard phrase extraction algorithm
(Zens et al, 2002) to (FK1 , eI1, a?K1 ). Discarding the
cross phrases, we keep the other phrases as rules. In
a cross phrase, at least two chunk-word alignments
overlap on the target language side. An example
of a cross phrase is illustrated in Figure 2(c). Fig-
ure 2(a) and (b) illustrate the phrases for reordering
rules, which could be monotone phrases or reorder-
ing phrases.
5 Reordering Lattice Generation
5.1 Parsing the Source Sentence
The first step of chunk parsing is word segmentation.
Then, a POS tagger is usually needed for further
syntactic analysis. In our experiments, we use the
tool of ?Inst. of Computing Tech., Chinese Lexical
Analysis System (ICTCLAS)? (Zhang et al, 2003),
which does the two tasks in one pass.
Referring to the description of the chunking task
in CoNLL-20001, instead of English, a Chinese
chunker is processed and evaluated. Each word is
assigned a chunk tag, which contains the name of the
chunk type and ?B? for the first word of the chunk
and ?I? for each other word in the chunk. The ?O?
chunk tag is used for tokens which are not part of
any chunk. We use the maximum entropy tool YAS-
1http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/
4
Figure 3: Example of applying rules. The left part is the used rules. The right part is the generated new
orders of source words.
MET2 to learn the chunking model. The model is
based on a combination of word and POS tags. Since
specific training and test data are not available for
Chinese chunking, we convert subtrees of the Chi-
nese treebank (LDC2005T01) into chunks. As there
are many ways to choose a subtree, we uses the min-
imum subtree with the following constraints:
? a subtree has more than one child,
? the children of a subtree are all leaves.
Compared to chunking of English as in CoNLL-
2000, there are more chunk types (24 instead of 6)
and no single-word chunks. These two aspects make
chunking for Chinese harder.
5.2 Applying Reordering Rules
First, we search the reordering rules, in which the
chunk sequence matches any tag sequence in the in-
put sentence. A source sentence has many paths
generated by the rules . For a word uncovered by any
rules, its POS tag is used. Each path corresponds to
one sentence permutation.
The left part of the Figure 3 shows seven possible
coverages, the right part is the reordering for each
coverage. Some of the reorderings are identical, like
the permutations in line 1, 3 and 5. That is because
one word sequence is memorized by several rules in
different contexts.
5.3 Lattice Weighting
All reorderings of an input sentence S are com-
pressed and stored in a lattice. Each path is a possi-
2http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software
/index.html
ble reordering S? and is given a weight W . In this
paper, the weight is computed using a source lan-
guage model p(S?). The weight is used directly in
the decoder, integrated into Equation (4). There is
also a scaling factor for this weight, which is op-
timized together with other scaling factors on the
development data. The probability of the reordered
source sentence is calculated as follows: for a re-
ordered source sentence w1w2...wn, the trigram lan-
guage model is:
p(S?) =
N
?
n=1
p(wn|wn?2, wn?1) (5)
Beside a word N-gram language model, a POS tag
N-gram model or a chunk tag N-gram model could
be used as well.
In this paper, we use a word trigram model. The
model is trained on reordered training source sen-
tences. A training source sentence is parsed into
chunks. In the same way as described in Section
4.2, word-to-word alignments is converted to chunk-
to-word alignments. We reorder the source chunks
to monotonize the chunk-to-word alignments. The
chunk boundaries are kept when this reordering is
done.

6.1 Chunking Result
In this section, we report results for chunk parsing.
The annotation of the data is derived from the Chi-
nese treebank (LDC2005T01). The corpus is split
into two parts: 1000 sentences are randomly se-

lected as test data. The remaining part is used for
training. The corpus is from the newswire domain.
Table 2 shows the corpus statistics. For the 4 680
chunks in the test set, the chunker has found 4 414
chunks, of which 2 879 are correct. Following the
criteria of CoNLL-2000, the chunker is evaluated
using the F-score, which is a combination of pre-
cision and recall. The result is shown in Table 3.
The accuracy is evaluated at the word level, the
other three metrics are evaluated at the chunk level.
The results at the chunk level are worse than at the
word level, because a chunk is counted as correct
only if the chunk tag and the chunk boundaries are
both correct.
6.2 Translation Results
For the translation experiments, we report the two
accuracy measures BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002)
and NIST (Doddington, 2002) as well as the two
error rates word error rate (WER) and position-
independent word error rate (PER).
We perform translation experiments on the Ba-
sic Traveling Expression Corpus (BTEC) for the
Chinese-English task. It is a speech translation task
in the domain of tourism-related information. We
report results on the IWSLT 2004, 2005 and 2006
evaluation test sets. There are 16 reference trans-
lations for the IWSLT 2004 and 2005 tasks and 7
reference translations for the IWSLT 2006 task.
Table 4 shows the corpus statistics of the task. A
training corpus is used to train the translation model,
the language model and to obtain the reordering

rules. A development corpus is used to optimize the
scaling factors for the BLEU score. The English text
is processed using a tokenizer. The Chinese text pro-
cessing uses word segmentation with the ICTCLAS
segmenter (Zhang et al, 2003). The translation is
evaluated case-insensitive and without punctuation
marks.
The translation results are presented in Table 5.
The baseline system is a non-monotone translation
system, in which the decoder does reordering on
the target language side. Compared to the base-
line system, the source reordering method improves
the BLEU score by 0.5% ? 1.8% absolute. It also
achieves a better WER. Note that the used chun-
ker here is out-of-domain 3. An improvement is
achieved even with a low F-measure for chunking.
So, we could hope that larger improvement is possi-
ble using a high-accuracy chunker.
Though the input is a lattice, the source reordering
is still faster than the reordering during decoding,
e.g. for the IWSLT 2006 test set, the baseline system
took 17.5 minutes and the source reordering system
took 12.3 minutes. The result also indicates that the
non-monotone decoding hurts the performance in a
source reordering framework. A similar conclusion
is also presented in (Xia and McCord, 2004).
Additional experiments we carried out to compare
POS-level and chunk-level reorderings. We delete
the chunk information and keep the POS tags. Then,
3The chunker is trained on newswire data, but the test data
is from the tourism domain.

we rerun the source reordering system on the IWSLT
2004 test set. The translation results are shown in
Table 6. Though the accuracy of chunking is low,
the chunk-level method gets better results than POS-
level method. With POS tags, we get more reorder-
ing rules and more paths in the lattice, since the sen-
tence length is longer than with chunks. The statis-
tics are shown in Table 7.
7 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper presents a source-side reordering method
which is based on syntactic chunks. The reordering
rules are automatically learned from bilingual data.
To avoid hard decision before decoding, a reorder-
ing lattice representing all possible reorderings is
used instead of single source sentence for decoding.
The experiments demonstrate that even with a very
poor chunker, the chunk-level source reordering is
still helpful for a state-of-the-art statistical transla-
tion system and it has better performance than the
POS-level source reordering and target-side reorder-
ing.
There are some directions for future work. First,
we would like to try this method on larger data sets
and other language pairs. Second, we are going to
improve the chunking accuracy. Third, we would
reduce the number of rules and prune the lattice.
