A proposal is made for the use of contextual  in- 
formation in the machine translat ion of Japanese 
and English. This paper describes the use of a 
Context Monitor to nlaintai l l  contextual  infortmt- 
tion dyn,'unically and the ~tugmenlalion of appro- 
priate features to ~t semantic network to enahh~ 
simple inference. The al}proach taken is that {}t" 
"best gucs~?' processing with the cont~extual infor- 
mation being hal~dled with semantic inf{~rmalion 
on ~ shallow level.

This might be translated by a current, machine tl'ans-

An attempt has therefore I}een made to solve some 
of tile problems of translal.ing languages SllCIt sis 
Japanese and English using contextual information. 
Due to \[.he consideral.ions of wanting to produce a 
high quality small-sized MT system, lhe approach 
taken is to use tile resources awdlahle in an exisl;ing 
MT system and to process the contextu;d i,l\['orlmd.ion

to guide the translation on a "best guess" basis. This 
kiml of feal,ure with rat.her light; processing for the 
production of a higher quality translation is desirable 
in a pracl,ical MT system because the advanl.ages of

'\]'he current, dictionaries conl,~dn information to trans-

which (:own' a wide range of sentence pal,terns.

of tile source f~structure to the target f-structure. As 
context processing is carried out on only a shallow 
level, only information for lexical item, nurnber, per- 
son, gender, case role etc is used in the context system, 
along with semantic inIi)rtnation from the semantic 
network. The way that this information is used will 
be explained below in regard to the specific problems 
that tile use of context is intended to resolw~. 
4 The  Context  Mon i to r  
The context monitor proposed in this pal)er 
uses a standard focussing theory as a basis 
(\[Sidner 81\]),\[Sid,ler 8(i\]), amlough sonrexvhat simpli- 
fied according to the bes* :press approach that we are 
adopting. It is planned to increase the COml~lexily of 
this initial algorithm to reflect more current wn'sions 
of the theory as the system is developed. 
The context monitor has a number of basic data 
structures: Current l;k)cus, Actor l'~oeus, Potential ,'o- 
cus List, Potential Actor I;'ocus List, Discourse Seg- 
ment Stack and Actor I:ocus Stack. There is also a 
Current State List that maintains a record of all the 
semantic items currently hehl in any of the other data 
structures and the semantic features to whMl they 
are linked. This list is updated (entries added :rod 
removed) after every sentence. 
In ordc'r to lilnlt the scope of the context informa- 
tion required in the context monitor, an analysis was 
made of the main differences between 3apanese aml 
English that provide problenas for MT syst.ems. The 
basis of the analysis was to find what information can 
be gained from context to solve these problems. 
4 .1  P lu ra l  Fomns  
Japanese is (in general a) mmlarkc'd for mlmber. I';n- 
glish, however, differentiates between singular and 
plural, q'his fact causes problems when translating 
t?om Japanese to English as the mlmber information 
required for the inflection and declension of English is 
not available from the analysis of the 3apanese. I:or 
example: 
(I,oy(s),,,~, dog(s)o,,s lille) 
The boy likes th.e do~j. 
The bo W like the cloy. 
The boy likes Zhe dolls. 
The bow like Hie do!Is. 
Bogs like doas. 
In the current system an initial sellt.ence analyzed 
by the system is processed to find possible: ff)ci. II,ents 
which are in the l)lural or are in conjunction are stored 
as a set. 'Che set as a whole is given phlral nultll)er, 
aNote the use of .t'~ ('l(tchi') with main ly  people and an lm. ls ,  
but consists of imlividual items or, as} in the case of 
"/we ~e,v  7'V models and fo~tr 7~ew video models", as 
subsets. Subsets or individual items within the sets 
are available as antecedents to subsequ.etlt referring 
expressiolls. 
'\]_'hus, in the example text. in Section 1, after the 
initial sentence is analysed, the proposed focus is two 
new TV models and fmtr new video models, the strut.- 
lure o\[" which is shown in Figure 3 below: 4

rcf:set3\], 
,'of:set 1\] 
l:igure 3: PIi.Of, OG Structure 
Sentence 2 (S?) is analysed and a test is made to 
see if any items in that sentence confirm or reject the 
proposed focus. 'l'he structure for the item g'7"~ 
("a video/videos") is matched by mfiIication with the 
structure for the prol)osed focus and can Im matched 
with a subset of it., namely ~)i k. v,/2"-)~  - IJtl,~K~{\[( ("d 
new video models"). That  item is there.fore taken Io 
conllrm the proposed R)t:us. 
That  proposed I'oeus is, however, hnmedhttely 
PUSlled onto the focus stack because the subset of 4 
vhleos is taken as the current \['ocus 5. 'Phe item 13-)~";t 
of $2 inherits the feal.tlrcs of the set. of videos fronl S I. 
aml is therefore xpressed ill the I(nglish with a plu- 
ral form: "videos". It is hoped that in this way the 
conl ext monitor will be able to distinguish between 
singular alld plural in at least some cases.

network and these links can change dynamically in 
respect to the specific objects and colicepts referred 
to in thc text. This provides a powerflil augnlentation 
to the basic nctwork. 
4 ,4  The  Augmented  Semant ic  Net -  
work  
Tile semantic network in this system is basically a hi- 
erarchy of Objects, States and Events. The addition 
of features to the semantic network in effect adds links 
to the network. Two kinds of link are proposed: per- 
manent links and temporary links. Permanent' links 
are conditions that must be true for a certain action 
or state-of-affairs to bold. The other, temporary, links 
are used to create a default state for the objects men- 
tioned in the text. As the text is processed, these links 
may change, so that the information awtilable to the 
system will differ from one sentence to the next. 
4.4.1 The  L inks  
The division between Objects, States and Events is re- 
flected in tlle type of feature given to semantic itclnS. 
For exainple, Events typically coilgain features about 
the sort of things that are affected by that event; 
States contain information the types of objects that 
may be in that state; Objects contain i i l forlnaiiou 
about any subparts or if they themselves are typi- 
cally part of another (larger) object and wliat type of 
Event they are typically involved in. 
On this basis, the following types of link are pro- 
posed: 
. Condition (=c): (permanent) a condition that must 
|lold for a State or Event to come about. 
, Before Condition (BC::): (pernianeut) a condition 
that must be trlie before an Event or State conies 
about. 
* After Condition (AC::): (permanent) a co,ldition 
that becomes trtie after an Event or State comes 
about. 
* Has Subpart (l,as): (tenlporary) an Object lias re-- 
lated subparts or is a subpart of another Object. 
* Characteristic (has Semautic.Label): (I.emliorary) 
an Object has the characteristic of Senmntie_Lal)el 
(usually an Abstract_Relation: Size, Shape Colour 
etc.). This takes the form of: "lteni has Senlau- 
tie_Label", such as "Pelerhas Ex is te l ,ee  Li f~span".  
Tiffs states that an item witll tile semantic item Pe- 
ter has an existence of some kind and filrther locates 
tllat itenl on a path of the network to the abstract 
relation of lAfespan. Iu this way, nodes between these 
two points are all available for reference by the infer- 
ence system. 
. Ability (able_to): (temporary) This is not fully de- 
fined in tim current systenl but represents character- 
istic features of items e.g. "dooF' often appears in the 
tlleme position of tile Events Open aud ,O'hll\[. 
These liuks are considered sutllcient for tile current 
capabilities of the system. I,inks may be deleted or 
others added as the range of the sytem widens, if this 
is tllought necessary or desirable. 
4.4.2 Permanent  .(k Ten lporary  L inks 
The dlfference between perrnal lent and I;enll)orary 
links is iu the nature of the iuformation that they con- 
vey. Permauent links are those that are augmented 
to tile l le twork  and COlllleCt uodes cue I,o ti le other  
in accordance with the features found in those nodes. 
~Bef(~re Condition and Aries" Condition links are per- 
manent, although the hiformation contaiued in the 
uodes that, t.hey connect to will only become awdl- 
able to the context nlonitor iu accordance with the 
tense al/d aspect of the verb (i.e.. all After Condi- 
lion is obviously only valid crier the completion of 
the (for exalnplc) action denoted by a verb has fin- 
ished. Teniporary liuks are those that supply default 
i l l for f l lat ion to the COlltext Il~Ollitor coucerning nodes 
that  it is COliCerlied wii.h. 'Fhus, for exaluF, le > an entry  
for a bird iu ight  state that  it is Able_To Fly. l lowever,  
i f  the input text were to state that a particular bird 
is unable to fly, that A1Ao "l'o link would be cancelled. 
Thus toll lporary links provide the i l i forulatioi l  that 
the colitext nlonitor rises> using the teinporary links 
to spread throughoilt the network (within set search 
constraints) aild gat.hering inPoruiatioii that Call lie

and therefore l,iving, l lowever, the After (\]ontliLiol;s 
of the Event Die cancel the feature laving lil connec- 
tion with "John" ('~o1' means that  a \[?ature aml all 
tile other features underneath it in the tree should 
not be reachable by that item), and state, that the 
item should be associated with the fimture "Corpse" 
(a semantic label in the system for something that 
was living but is no longer). Thus the semantic item 
"John" is first linked with the semantic feature "l lu- 
man" and all the other featm'es inherited from that 
feature. However, the features associated with the 
semantic item "Die" cause the links associated with 
"John" to change. This means that when tile see- 
end sentence is analysed, the possilfle candidates f()r 
the exl)erieneer role of the semantic item "lhLSa(f' 
are analysed, an itmn with the semantic feature "All- 
inmte" will be sought, and so the item ",/ok." will 
not be considered in the. search as it is no long,-r on 
a path reachable hy "Animate.". "Pete/ '  is therefore 
the only possible antecedent. 
4.~ Art i c les  
Japanese does not use de.finite and indefinite arti- 
des  and so when there is no ow.'rt determiner in the 
aal)anese, one must be supplied for the English trans- 
lation. For example, Sentence 2 of ore" example text:

They passed the videos to the Sales ,qeetion. 
Where a simple default rule is used for articles, ibis 
eouhl equally be machine translated as: I\]te 9 llaSsed 
videos to the Sales Division ~, where it can be co.sid- 
ered that  some of the sense of  the or ig inal  seuteuce is 
lost. 
While the use of contextual informatDm canl~.t 
solve all of the prolflems of art.Mes, it is hoped that at 
least in some eases incorrect possil)ililies (:;m I)e elimi- 
nated (following tile "l>est guess" policy). I1, lhe cases 
that  the context monitor cannot decide, an article, the 
MT system default will be re.lied upon. 
% decide between a definite and indefinite article in 
\]'~nglish, a simple rule of thumb in the present system 
is that once an object has been specified in a coiitexL, 
6ttSstlnlillg that  the noun is defined as phu'al l)y sonic (~lher 
process, oLherwlse a vtdeo is als~ a l)osslbilily 
;ill subsequent references to that parLichh~r object in 
the saine context will be definite r. 
In the method proposed here, as objects are anal- 
ysed, they are giwm a unique reference number (re*)  
that separates them l'ron~ all other objects of file same 
type. Thus, the first t ime that an object is analysed, 
it will be nLade indefinite, unless the reference can l)e 
analysed as being ;t generic one (e.g. The lio~ is a 
da~lerous animal et(:). 
l"rom then on, if an item ill the text can be linked to 
an il.em which is the current focus, a potential  focus 
or an i(.em on the focus stack, it will l)e made definite 
i .  the English tr;mslation. Therefore, the two video 
models of Sentence 3 are recognised as a sul)set of 
the four videos that Form the focus and are. given the 
(lefild/.e article. 
Note also that as subparts of  objects are inch|ded in 
the features attached to selllantic items using the has  
feature, objects related to an item already ment.ioned 
call also be treated to solne extent and translated with 
deft. ite a,'tich.'s:

5 L imi ta t ions  g~ Prob lems 
As shown above, the inferencing carried out is very 
simple. It depends entirely on the links between odes 
of the network and there is an obvious limit as to 
how complicated those links may I)eeome before the 
processing required to search all t,he nodes linked to 
a particular item becomes prohibitiw~'. At, the current, 
stage of planning, a strnctnre (a semantic il.eni) may 
be linked to another via one node (constrained l o be 
an Abstract It.elation). There are no current plans I.o 
increase the number of such linking nodes. 
The inference mechanism is also expected to per- 
form poorly where actions denoted by a wn'b are COlll- 
plex. This is due to the very simple feature descrip- 
tions that we use in the systenl. It might therefore 
be desirable that,  if the processing is not ccmlpleted 
within, for example, a constrained time, the process 
be terminated and the context moiiit,or left to rely on 
semantic feature matching alone. 
Another major problem is writing the features for 
the links in the network. At the moment, all features 
are written by hand, })tit, it is hoped that sinlilar in- 
formation might be extracted from semantic and case- 
fi'ame dictionaries. 
The context monitor is currently written in PI I0- 
LOG 9. The program eui'rently consists of several hun- 
dred lines of PROLOG. 
6 F ina l  Remarks  
The idea of using contextual information in Ma- 
chine Translation has been proposed before (\[br ex- 
ainple \[Wada 90\],\[Elwrle 92\],\[ l laendt 921), ho,vev,'r, 
there SeelfiS to be l i t t le researc\]l carried ()lit ill the 
field. MT  res0areh still seems t,o take I.he sentence as 
i.he basle unit of translation and I.he qualil.y of thc.ir

pie inferencing. 
The best guess apl)roach tries to define a l)rol)leiil 
and specify the informatioa needed to solve that prob- 
lem. The context monitor syst,em searches tbr Sl)e('ific 
information fi'om the input sentence and if it: cannot 
find it, it  simply does nothing, ailowilig (.lie defaults of 
the translation system to supply the necessary hlfor- 
mation. The search routines of the context monitor 
look for that specific information at as earlier a sl.age 
as possible in the process aud so if that inforniation is

Even when the context monitor fails and the MT 
systeln defaults are relied upon, the context monitor

ter translation produced iH many more cases and the 
fact that interference with the speed of the translation 
is negligible mean I.ha~; the prospects for a coral)act- 
sized personal MT system producing better quality 
translations are very promising.
