In this paper an artificial ife approach 
to the explanation of the shape of 
vowel systems is presented. A popu- 
lation of artificial agents (small inde- 
pendent computer programs) that are 
each able to produce and perceive vow- 
els in a human-like way, engages in 
imitation games. In these imitation 
games one agent makes a sound and 
another agent tries to imitate it. Both 
agents use their list of phonemes for 
analysing and producing the sounds. 
Depending on the outcome of the lan- 
guage game, the agents update their 
phoneme .lists, using only local infor- 
mation. It is demonstrated that in this 
way vowel systems that look remark- 
ably like human vowel systems emerge. 
The process is insensitive to factors 
such as noise level, initial conditions 
and number of agents. It is argued 
that this could be a useful way of ex- 
plaining the universal characteristics 
of human vowel systems. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The world's languages contain a surprising num- 
ber of different sounds. In the most recent ver- 
sion (1996) of the UCLA Phonological Segment 
Inventory Database (Maddieson, 1984) 921 dif- 
ferent segments are recognised: 652 consonants 
and 269 vowels and diphthongs. However, in 
any particular language, only a limited number 
of these sounds are used. According to Mad- 
dieson, most languages have between 20 and 37 
phonemes. The minimum number is 11 for the 
East-Papuan language Rotokas and the South- 
American language Mfra-Pirahg, and the max- 
imum number is 141 for the Khoisan language 
!Xfi (Grimes, 1996; Maddieson, 1984). The typ- 
ical number of phonemes, according to Mad- 
dieson, lies between 20 and 37. 
Also certain regularities are found in the 
sound systems of the languages of the world. If 
we concentrate on vowels, we find that certain 
vowels, such as \[u\] \[a\] and \[i\] appear almost uni- 
versally, while other vowels, such as \[~\], \[o\] and 
\[ce\] are much rarer. The structure of vowel sys- 
tems also shows great regularities. They tend to 
be symmetric. If a language has a front vowel 
of a certain height, for example \[e\], it is likely 
to have the back vowel of the same height \[o\] 
as well, although the two vowels will usually 
differ in rounding. Languages tend to prefer 
vowel systems in which the acoustic difference 
between the vowels is as big as possible. For 
this reason, vowel systems with just \[i\], \[a\] and 
\[u\] appear more frequently than systems with 
just \[e\], \[a\] and \[o\], or with \[i\], \[a\] and \[m\]. 
Traditionally, these phenomena have been 
explained through distinctive feature theory 
(Chomsky and Halle, 1968; Jakobson and Halle, 
1956). The preferred shapes of vowel systems 
are explained by innate distinctive features, and 
by their markedness. Features plit up the con- 
tinuous articulatory space. As there are only a 
limited number of features, vowel systems will 
only contain a limited number of vowels, and 
because some features are more marked than 
s't 
others, some vowels and some combinations of 
vowels will appear less often than others. 
Unfortunately, this theory does not address 
the question where the distinctive features come 
from, nor how a discrete set of phonemes came 
to be used for communication i  the first place. 
It still remains to be explained what the reason 
for the presence of discrete phonemes and dis- 
tinctive features is. As (Lindblom et al 1984, 
page 187) wrote: "...postulating segments and 
features as primitive universal categories of lin- 
guistic theory should be rejected...". Also, dis- 
tinctive feature theory does not explain why 
certain minor differences in pronunciation are 
replicated so closely by speakers of a certain 
dialect. For example, there is a difference be- 
tween English do, French doux (soft), German 
du (thou) and Dutch doe (do) that is perceived 
and recognised by speakers of these languages, 
even though all these words are described as an 
anterior and coronal voiced consonant followed 
by a high, back, rounded vowel. 
In order to explain the shapes of sound sys- 
tems of the world's language without having to 
resort to innate features, a number of functional 
explanations have been put forward. For vowel 
systems different researchers (Liljencrants and 
Lindblom, 1972; Bo~ et al 1995) (among oth- 
ers) have given elaborate computational models. 
These models predict he qualities of the vowels 
in vowel systems with a given number of vow- 
els by calculating a maximum for the acoustic 
distances between the vowels. Carr~ and Mray- 
ati (Carr~ and Mrayati, 1995) have also used 
computer models for predicting vowel systems, 
based on articulatory as well as acoustic con- 
straints. Furthermore Stevens (Stevens, 1989) 
has developed a theory that explains the shape 
of sound systems through non-linear character- 
istics of the human vocal tract and auditory sys- 
tem. 
All these theories, although to some extent 
controversial, provide good explanations of why 
vowel systems are the way they are. They max- 
imise acoustic contrast and minimise articula- 
tory effort. However, the theories do not pro- 
vide a mechanism to explain how these char- 
acteristics obtain in a population of language 
users. They all consider language as an in- 
dependent system that somehow optimises a 
number of constraints. They do not take into 
account hat languages are used by individual 
speakers that are each quite capable of learn- 
ing and using any vowel system. Somehow, the 
interactions between these speakers cause the 
functional constraints as mentioned above to 
emerge. 
The emergence of constraints on vowel sys- 
tems through the interactions of individual 
agents has already been studied by Herv~ Glotin 
and others (Berrah et al 1996; Glotin, 1995; 
Glotin and Laboissi~re, 1996). Unfortunately, 
their work contains a number of unrealistic as- 
sumptions about the way in which sound sys- 
tems are transferred from generation to gen- 
eration. In their system agents use vowels to 
make sounds to each other. Vowels are shifted 
to make them more similar to the ones from 
the other agents. After a while the agents that 
have least shifted their vowels create offspring 
that replace agents that have much shifted their 
vowels. The initial position of the new agents' 
vowels is determined from the initial position of 
the vowels of the agents' parents. The number 
of vowels in each agent is fixed, which makes 
it less realistic. Another disadvantage of this 
system is that it does not model the way in 
which new agents acquire their phonemes (they 
already have a set from birth). Also the pseudo- 
genetic component obfuscates the actual pro- 
cesses (the language-like interactions between 
the agents) that shape the vowel systems. 
The work that will be presented here is based 
on the theory of Steels (Steels, 1997b). Steels 
considers language to be a phenomenon that is 
the result of self-organisation a d cultural evo- 
lution in a population of language users. Knowl- 
edge of the language is transferred through lin- 
guistic interactions that Steels calls language 
games. Individuals actively form and test hy- 
potheses about the language in these games. 
Innovation is introduced by random variations 
and errors in imitation. Selection pressure 
for more efficient and effective communication 
causes certain variations to be preferred over 
others. Self-organisation e sures that coherence 
is maintained. According to Steels, this mecha- 
nism can both explain the origin of language, as 
well as the acquisition of language by a single in- 
dividual. Steels has mainly tested his theory in 
the area of lexicon formation (Steels, 1995) and 
semantics (St'eels , 1997a). In the present paper 
the theory is 'applied to the field of phonology. 
In the next section some more background on 
self-organisation is given. In section 3 the simu- 
lation that was used for investigating the theory 
is described. In section 4 the experiments hat 
have been done are described, and in section 5 
some conclusions are drawn. 
2 Se l f -Organ isat ion  
Quite often spontaneous order can emerge in 
systems that are not controlled centrally. An 
example of this is the construction of a hon- 
eycomb. No isingle bee (not even the queen) 
has control over the building behaviour of the 
whole swarm.i Still, a very regular pattern of 
hexagons eme'rges. This happens because bees 
start to build cells at a certain distance from 
other bees that build cells. After a while they 
will encounter the neighbouring cells. Thus a 
pattern of hexagons emerges. Other examples 
of the outcomes of self-organising processes are 
termites' nests, sand dunes and the formation 
of paths. 
All self-organising systems have a large num- 
ber of constituent parts that interact on a small 
scale. Order emerges on a large scale. This or- 
der is obtained from initial random behaviour of 
the constituer~t parts through positive feedback 
processes. Th'ese feedback processes cause the 
constituent parts to settle collectively in a cer- 
tain state, once an accidental majority of them 
happens to be in that state. The field of "ar- 
tificial life" is concerned with the investigation 
of self-organisilng processes that are inspired by 
living systems:through computer simulations. 
The approach that is followed in this pa- 
per and that was introduced by Steels (Steels, 
1997b) is an artificial ife approach. Language is
a self-organisi~ig process. It exists in a commu- 
nity of speakers, and persists through the inter- 
actions of the speakers. No individual has cen- 
tral control over the language and no individual 
speaker is necessary for the persistence of the 
language. They are born and they die and still 
the language remains more or less continuous 
over time and throughout a population. 
The computer simulations that are presented 
here model linguistic interactions in an artifi- 
cial life way. This means that the emergence 
of order in a population of agents (small com- 
puter programs that can operate autonomously) 
is studied. The agents are able to produce and 
perceive speech sounds in an approximately hu- 
man way, they have only local knowledge (i.e. 
about their own speech sounds) and engage in 
local interactions with only one other agent at 
a time. It will be shown that phenomena that 
are also found in human vowel systems emerge. 
3 The  System 
The agents in the simulation are equipped with 
a speech synthesiser, a speech perception system 
and a list of phonemes. It should be stressed 
that the agents are not restricted to any partic- 
ular natural anguage. The speech synthesiser 
is capable of generating all simple vowels. It 
takes as input the three major vowel features: 
tongue position, tongue height and lip round- 
ing. Its output consists of the first four formant 
frequencies of the vowel that would be gener- 
ated by the specified articulator positions. The 
production model is based on an interpolation 
of artificially generated formant patterns of 18 
different vowels taken from (Vall~e, 1994, page 
162-164). A certain amount of noise is added 
to the formant frequencies: they are shifted up 
or down a random percentage. The speech per- 
ception system is based on a model developed 
by (Bo~ et al 1995) who based their system 
on a substantial amount of observations of hu- 
man perception of speech. In this model low 
frequency formants are considered to be more 
salient han high frequency formants and if two 
formants are close together, they are perceived 
approximately asone formant with an interme- 
diate frequency. These characteristics ensure 
that the agents perceive formant patterns as 
similar if humans would also perceive them as 
similar. Both the speech synthesiser and the 
speech perception system are described in more 
detail in (de Boer, 1997) 
The agents tart with an empty phoneme list: 
they know no phonemes at all. They learn their 
phonemes through interactions with each other. 
The shape of the resulting vowel system will be 
determined for a small part by coincidence and 
for the largest part by self-organisation u der 
acoustical and articulatory constraints. 
The interactions between the robots are 
called imitation games. For each imitation 
game, two agents are chosen randomly from the 
population. One agent will initiate the game 
and is called the initiator, the other one is called 
the imitator. The initiator randomly chooses 
a phoneme from its phoneme list, or creates 
a new phoneme randomly if its phoneme list 
is empty. It then generates the corresponding 
sound (the formant pattern). The imitator lis- 
tens to this sound, and analyses it in terms of 
its own phonemes. It tries to find among its 
own phonemes the phoneme whose formant pat- 
tern most closely resembles the sound it just 
heard. If its phoneme list is empty, it generates 
a new phoneme. The imitator then generates 
the sound that corresponds to its best matching 
phoneme. The initiator listens to this sound and 
also analyses it in terms of its own phonemes. 
It then checks whether the phoneme that most 
closely matches the sound it just heard is the 
same as the phoneme it originally said. If they 
are the same, the imitation game is successful. 
If they are not the same, the game is unsuccess- 
ful. 
Depending on the outcome of the language 
game, the imitator undertakes a number of ac- 
tions. If the language game was successful, it
shifts the phoneme it said in such a way that 
it will sound more like the sound it just heard. 
This is done by making slight changes to the 
phoneme and by checking whether these in- 
crease the resemblance. The change that most 
increases the resemblance is kept. This proce- 
dure is called hill climbing in artificial intelli- 
gence, and it is comparable to making sounds 
to oneself in order to learn how to pronounce a 
given sound. 
If the imitation game was unsuccessful, the 
agent can either create a new phoneme or shift 
the old phoneme, depending on whether the 
phoneme it used for imitating the sound had 
previously been successful or not. The success 
of a phoneme is calculated by keeping track of 
the number of times a phoneme was used in an 
imitation game (both by initiator and by imita- 
tor) and the number of times the imitation game 
in which the phoneme was used was successful. 
The ratio between these numbers is used as a 
measure of success of the phoneme. 
If the phoneme has been unsuccessful, it is 
shifted to resemble more closely the sound that 
was heard. If it has been successful, however, it 
is assumed that the failure of the imitation game 
was caused by the fact that two phonemes are 
confused. The initiator has two phonemes that 
are matched by only one phoneme in the imita- 
tor. Hence the imitator creates a new phoneme 
that closely resembles the sound that was heard. 
This usually resolves the confusion. 
Two more processes are taking place in the 
agents. First of all, an agent's phonemes that 
resemble ach other too closely are merged. 
Two phonemes are merged by keeping the most 
successful one and by throwing away the least 
successful one. The successfulness of the new 
phoneme is calculated by adding the use- and 
success counts of the original phonemes. Sec- 
ondly, phonemes that have a use/success ra- 
tio that is too low, are discarded. This causes 
bad phonemes to disappear eventually from the 
phoneme repertoire of the agents. 
4 The  Exper iments  
A large number of experiments have been done 
with the system described above. Experi- 
ments have been performed with varying num- 
bers of agents and under various conditions of 
noise. The system consistently produced popu- 
lations of agents that were able to imitate each 
other successfully with the vowel systems that 
emerged. These vowel systems howed remark- 
able similarities with vowel systems found in 
human languages. A typical example of the 
vowel systems of a population of 20 agents, with

a maximum of 10% noise on the formant fre- 
quencies, is given in figure 1. This figure is an 
acoustic representation f all the phonemes of 
all the agents in the population. In this fig- 
ure a number Of clear clusters can be discerned. 
Almost all the phonemes of the agents tend to 
appear in one of the seven clusters. In addi- 
tion, almost all agents have a phoneme in the 
six largest clusters. Only in the small cluster in 
the lower left ,corner, representing the \[u\], few 
agents have a phoneme. This is probably be- 
cause this phoneme has recently been created, 
and not all agents have been able to make an 
imitation, yet. 
The vowel systems that emerge from the im- 
itation games! are not static. They are con- 
stantly changi~ng as new phonemes are formed 
and old phonemes hift through the available 
acoustic spac e . This process is illustrated in 
figure 3, the :result from a different simula- 
tion with the ~ame starting conditions (twenty 
agents and 10% noise) but with slightly differ- 
ent random influences. In this figure we see two 
vowel systems: that are snapshots of one pop- 
ulation of agents, taken 1000 language games 
apart. We see that clusters move through the 
acoustic space' and that clusters tend to com- 
pact. However, a certain distance appears to 
be kept between the clusters. Also the clusters 
seem to remain spread over a certain area; they

do not reduce to points completely. 
Under various conditions of noise, systems 
with different numbers of clusters emerge. If the 
amount of noise is increased, systems with fewer 
clusters are generated (an example is given in 
figure 2). However, the success of the im- 
itation games stays approximately the same. 
Also the number of agents does not seem to 
matter much. Experiments with five to forty 
agents have all resulted in stable systems. Fur- 
thermore, the systems eem to be resistant o 
population change. If old agents are removed 
at random, and new empty agents are added 
at random, the vowel systems remain stable. 
The empty agents will rapidly learn the exist- 
ing phonemes by imitating more experienced 
agents. If the inflow of new agents becomes too 
large, however, instability arises. 
5 Conc lus ions  and  D iscuss ion  
The first conclusion that can be drawn from 
the work presented above is that stable sound 
systems do emerge in a population of artifi- 
cial agents that play imitation games. More- 
over, these systems have discrete clusters in 
a continuous acoustic space that could be de- 
scribed by (discrete) distinctive features, even 
though there was no predetermined partition of

the acoustic space. In addition, it can be con- 
cluded that the shapes of these emergent sys- 
tems show remarkable similarities to the shapes 
of the most frequent vowel systems found in hu- 
man languages. 
It remains to be seen to what extent these 
results are applicable to human language. It 
must be admitted that the language capabil- 
ities of the simulated agents are a gross sim- 
plification of the language capabilities of hu- 
mans. However, the agents are entirely biolog- 
ically plausible. This means that they can do 
nothing that humans could not do in princi- 
ple. Also, they provide a possible mechanism 
by which functional constraints on vowel sys- 
tem that were first researched with computers 
by Liljencrants and Lindblom (Liljencrants and 
Lindblom, 1972) can emerge from interacting 
language users. 
The system described here provides a model 
for predicting certain universals of vowel sys- 
tems. It does not have to postulate innate 
distinctive features or innate mechanisms other 
than the fact that agents communicate with a 
limited set of sounds. Also the system shows 
individual variation and language change that 
do not decrease the agents' ability to analyse 
each other's sounds. A remarkable property 
of the simulations that have been presented is
that both the learning of speech sounds as well 
as sound change can be generated by the same 
mechanism. 
The author thinks that these results justify 
considering phonological processes in language 
as self-organising processes. By taking this 
point of view it also becomes possible to bridge 
the gap between language as behaviour of indi- 
viduals and language as a system by using com- 
putational models.
