Abstract
In this paper, we propose that MT is an im-
portant technology in crisis events, something
that can and should be an integral part of a
rapid-response infrastructure. By integrating
MT services directly into a messaging infras-
tructure (whatever the type of messages being
serviced, e.g., text messages, Twitter feeds,
blog postings, etc.), MT can be used to pro-
vide first pass translations into a majority lan-
guage, which can be more effectively triaged
and then routed to the appropriate aid agen-
cies. If done right, MT can dramatically in-
crease the speed by which relief can be pro-
vided. To ensure that MT is a standard tool
in the arsenal of tools needed in crisis events,
we propose a preliminary Crisis Cookbook,
the contents of which could be translated into
the relevant language(s) by volunteers imme-
diately after a crisis event occurs. The result-
ing data could then be made available to relief
groups on the ground, as well as to providers
of MT services. We also note that there
are significant contributions that our commu-
nity can make to relief efforts through con-
tinued work on our research, especially that
research which makes MT more viable for
under-resourced languages.
1 Introduction
The connected world contains approximately 5000
languages ? at least that is how many languages you
could find at the other end of your phone right now.
However, the majority of these languages are under-
resourced, and they have few or no digital resources.
In the event of a sudden onset crisis, people will
immediately begin using their communication tech-
nologies ? and their languages ? to report their situ-
ations, request help, and seek out loved ones. Yet,
in the event that such a crisis occurs in a region
of the world where an under-resourced language is
spoken, delivery of support or aid could be affected
due to the inability to communicate. This was felt
most strongly in the wake of the January 12, 2010
earthquake in Haiti. Local emergency response ser-
vices were inoperable, but 70-80% of cell-towers
were quickly restored. With 83% of men and 67% of
women possessing cellphones, the nation remained
largely connected. People within Haiti were texting,
calling, and interacting with social media, primarily
in Haitian Kreyo`l (Munro, 2011). Yet, most of the
aid that was being delivered to the country ? initially,
soley by the American Military ? was being deliv-
ered by groups that did not communicate in Kreyo`l.
It was the first time that the world has seen a large-
scale sudden onset crisis in a region with productive
digital communications in an under-resourced lan-
guage, but it certainly will not be the last.
We strongly believe that MT is an important tech-
nology to facilitate communication in crisis situa-
tions, crucially since it can make content in a lan-
guage spoken or written by a local population ac-
cessible to those that do not know the language, in
particular aid agencies. Multiple groups saw MT
as a grand challenge in the Haitian crisis, and they
set to work to make MT available as soon as pos-
sible after the crisis. Within two weeks of the cri-
sis, the first two MT engines were built and were
available to those who needed them. We believe that
we can make MT available just as quickly in future
crises, and, with the right preparation, tightly inte-
grate MT into the communication infrastructure that
is deployed (e.g., the text messaging infrastructure).
The challenge is doing the work now to make this
vision possible.
In this paper, we describe the technologies that
came to play in the Haitian crisis, how Haitian
Kreyo`l MT was developed, the problems of surprise
languages and low resource MT, and detail the re-
search and technologies, cast as a ?Crisis MT Cook-
book?, that will be essential for MT to form a core
role in future crises. In Sections 2, 3, and 4 we dis-
cuss Mission 4636 and the technologies that came
501
into play in Haiti and other recent crises, and the
role that technologies can and should play in future
crises. In Section 5, we discuss what made Haitian
Kreyo`l a special case of a ?surprise language?, and
how MT was developed for the language. In Sec-
tion 6, we review the NLP and MT research areas
that will likely net big returns for under-resourced
languages. In Section 7, we review the need for an
MT Crisis Cookbook, and what the data and infras-
tructural components of the Cookbook should be.
Finally, in Section 8 we review a sample crisis time-
line, and how a crisis might play out with all the
components of the Cookbook available. Section 9
wraps up the paper.
2 Mission 4636
In Haiti, crowdsourced translation enabled com-
munications between the Kreyo`l-speaking Haitian
population and English-speaking emergency respon-
ders. A small group of international aid workers
established a phone-number,?4636?1 , that people
were able to send text messages to for free within
Haiti. The actual translations were made by about
2000 Kreyo`l2 and French speaking volunteers col-
laborating on an online microtasking platform that
they used to translate, categorize, identify missing
people and geolocate information on a map (Munro,
2010).3 After a month, this work was gradually
transferred to paid workers in Mirebalais, Haiti.
These messages, about 80,000 in total, were used
as part of the shared task for the 2011 Workshop
on Machine Translation. About 3,000 of the mes-
sages had the categories and coordinates refined by a
third workforce working with the Ushahidi platform
out of Boston.4 They published this information on
an online crisis map and worked directly with the
main emergency responder, the American Military,
to identify actionable information.
1See the ?Mission 4636? website at
http://www.mission4636.org for more information about
the organization and its efforts in Haiti.
2We use the term Kreyo`l for the Creole spoken in Haiti to
differentiate it from other Creoles. This is also in concord with
customary usage in Haiti.
3An author of this paper, Robert Munro, coordinated this
process and is a founding member and translation coordinator
for the Standby Task Force, which is discussed later in the paper.
4For more information on Ushahidi, see
http://www.ushahidi.org.
The strategy for translation was extremely effec-
tive - 80,000 messages equates to about 10 novels of
information, translated in real-time, lifting a burden
off people in Haiti. One high-ranking official de-
scribed the translation process as a ?perfect match?
of social media and traditional emergency response
(Anderson, 2010).
To meet the scale of translation needs, machine
translation services were quickly shipped. A mem-
ber of Mission 4636 built a high-precision, low-
coverage dictionary-based system that was used by
a number of translators. A couple of days later,
the world?s first publically accessible Stastical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT) engine for Kreyo`l was de-
veloped by Microsoft Research, with Google Re-
search following several days later with their own
engine.5 Although the statistical translation engines
were not used directly in the SMS translation ef-
fort, there is evidence they were used by those who
were involved in the relief effort, as determined by
blog postings and a review of translation logs show-
ing relief-centric translations. Although Kreyo`l is
not a high traffic language?it was not expected that
it would be?about 5% of the traffic in the weeks
and the months following the earthquake appeared
to be relief-related, suggesting that machine transla-
tion was being used those who needed it most.6 Had
MT been integrated directly into the text messaging
infrastructure used in Haiti, this percentage would
have been significantly larger.
3 Translation and crisis response - a
quickly changing field
To establish a ready-workforce to aid information
processing in relief efforts an organization called the
5A rough timeline of these developments can
be seen in the commentary posted to the Lan-
guage Log website (see specifically the archive at:
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2068).
6The logs output by Microsoft Translator?s engine were ex-
amined, and categorized roughly into broad categories describ-
ing the type of content. These categories were: Relief Related
(suspected), Colloquial or Common Expressions (which could,
in fact, have been relief related), Chat, and Unknown. The anal-
ysis was done by hand on a random sample of 200 messages
from the many thousands of messages received within a couple
of months of the quake. There were a large number of strings
that were difficult to categorize, including many partial strings,
and a bias against Relief Related when it was not clear. Thus,
the 5% estimate is likely a conservative one.
502
Standby Task Force was established in late 2010. Its
founding members had worked together in the Haiti
and/or subsequent Pakistan response efforts. It cur-
rently has several hundred members who special-
ize in tasks like report mapping, verification, media
monitoring and translation. Of all the different tasks
that volunteers can perform, translation is the least
transferable from one crisis to the next.
Following from the lessons learned in Haiti,
crowdsourced and machine translation have been
combined for a number of aid efforts: vote monitor-
ing for the referendem in Southern Sudan (Arabic);
a UN-led earthquake simulation in Colombia (Span-
ish); and for crisis mapping following the tsunami in
Japan (Japanese).
When information is immediately translated into
a high resource language it can be quickly triaged by
a greater number of people. The more time-intensive
task of manually correcting any mistranslations can
be performed in parallel. This workflow of combin-
ing machine and crowdsourced translation is largely
a succesful one and is likely to become common
practice in humanitarian information processing.
The combination of manual and machine-
translation was found to be effective across unpre-
dictable input:
?An email came into the Sudan Vote Mon-
itor platform in Indonesian - your plugin
did a good job of translating it into English
and Arabic?
Helena Puig Larrauri, volunteer for Sudan
Vote Monitor (P.C.)
But not without errors, especially across vital
phrases like location names:
?Names of neighborhoods such as Salitre
or Puerta al Llano were not recognized as
such and unnecessarily being translated.?
Marta Poblet, volunteer for Colombia
earthquake simulation (P.C.)
When the uprisings hit Libya in early 2011 the
United Nations did not have the capacity to col-
lect vital ground-truth data in the lead up to their
involvement. Information about refugee numbers
and needs were on web-accessible articles and so-
cial media, as were reports about the movements of
government and rebel troops and vunerable popula-
tions within the country. But there simply wasn?t the
workforce within the UN to aggregate and verify so
much information. This was the first time the United
Nations directly engaged a volunteer workforce for
large-scale information processing, requesting the
Standby Tasks Force?s deployment. It was also
the first time that so much information had come
from social media, a potentially large but unstruc-
tured data source, but it gave the UN a huge head-
start in their efforts (Verity, 2011). Crowdsourced
and machine translation were also combined here,
but in this case by directly engaging Arabic speak-
ers in media monitoring and by using reports from
Meedan.7
In a crisis, it will now be more common than not
that the volume of available digital information will
surpass the volume of information that aid-workers
can collect directly from the ground. This rapid
change is being quickly met by a rapid change in
cloud-based and automated solutions to language
processing, especially machine translation.
4 Translation and low-resource languages
We were fortunate that Arabic, Spanish and
Japanese are high resource languages for which
online machine translation services already exist.
Speakers of low resource languages cannot currently
benefit from this kind of translation service and yet
low resource languages are disproportionally spoken
by the world?s most vunerable populations. Over the
last 12 months many problems have been solved re-
garding the workflow of managing crisis data, but
one of the biggest remaining problems is the abil-
ity to quickly deploy machine-translation systems to
augment relief efforts.
While translation is not widely discussed aspect
of crisis response, it is ?a perennial hidden issue?
(Disaster 2.0, 2011):
?Go and look at any evaluation from the
last ten or fifteen years. ?Recommenda-
tion: make effective information available
7Meedan is an NGO that seeks to create greater understand-
ing between the Arabic and English speaking world by translat-
ing media reports and blogs between the languages, combining
quick machine-translation with corrections by a volunteer com-
munity.
503
to the government and the population in
their own language.? We didn?t do it . . . It
is a consistent thing across emergencies.?
Brendan McDonald, UN OCHA in (Dis-
aster 2.0, 2011)
Beyond the particular use case of small-to-
medium scale emergency information processing,
machine translation can also contribute to aid ef-
forts when the scale of information is beyond any
manual processing. In addition to the Libya deploy-
ment, a recent Red Cross survey (2010) found that
nearly half the respondents would use social media
to report emergencies. It simply would not be possi-
ble to translate all real-time reports when expressed
through social media, but translation into a high re-
source language could aid semi-automated methods
for discovering and prioritizing information.
There is, therefore, a great need to explore meth-
ods for rapid deployment of machine-translation
systems into minority languages. The questions that
we seek to address in this paper is how we as a com-
munity can prepare for the eventuality of the next
crisis, can draw from the lessons we learned in the
Haitian crisis, and might significantly impact the aid
effort in the next and future crises.
5 Surprise Languages: What Made Haiti
Different?
On January 19th, 2010, the Microsoft Research
Translator team received an e-mail from the field re-
questing that they develop an MT engine for Haitian
Kreyo`l to assist in the relief effort. At the time, no
publically available MT engine existed for Kreyo`l.
In less than five days, the Microsoft Translator site
was supporting the language. Given that it can take
weeks to months to develop an MT engine for a new
language, it would not seem possible that an engine
could be developed so quickly, especially for a low-
resource, minority language. The reasons this was
possible are varied, and are in some ways unique to
Kreyo`l.
Haitian Kreyo`l, as it turns out, has proven to be an
exceptional case for a surprise language. Unlike the
languages in Surprise Language Exercises of nearly
a decade ago (Oard, 2003; Oard and Och, 2003),
in which participants were given a month to collect
data and build language technologies for previously
unknown languages, including Machine Translation
systems, there was a surprising amount of data for
Kreyo`l at the start of the Haitian crisis, and it be-
came available relatively quickly. Partly, this is due
to the growth of the Web, which has proven to be
a surpisingly diverse multi-lingual resource. But it
also stems crucially from work that had been done
in the past on Kreyo`l, specifically, the work that was
done in the DIPLOMAT and NESPOLE! projects at
CMU (Frederking et al, 1997). It was possible to
assemble a reasonable sample of data for the lan-
guage in very short order (i.e., days). Further, since
the language itself is fairly reduced morphologically,
it is an easier target for SMT. In contrast, if one
were to sample a language at random from the set
of the 7,000 languages spoken on the earth, one is
more likely to find a language that is morpholog-
ically richer (e.g., fusional, aggutinating, polysyn-
thetic). Morphological richness compounds the data
sparsity problem, reducing the quality of the result-
ing SMT engines.
In other words, a combination of a simple
morphology combined with reasonably accessible
sources of data made the rapid deployment of MT
for Kreyo`l far more likely. That is not to say
that there weren?t problems. First, Kreyo`l is fairly
?young? as a written language8 , and is still in the
early stages of orthographic standardization and nor-
malization (Allen, 1998). This has led to inconsis-
tencies in the orthography that increases data sparse-
ness and noise. Further, Kreyo`l has multiple regis-
ters in its written form: a ?high? register that uses
full forms for pronouns and a set of function words,
and a ?low? register that corresponds more closely
to its spoken form, and is written with many con-
tractions. For example, the Kreyo`l word for the first
person pronoun is mwen. It can be written as mwen
(the high register), or contracted to m? (the low regis-
ter). The form can either be attached to the succeed-
ing word or written with a following space. Like-
wise, the first person possessive is also mwen which
is written following the word that is possessed. This
8Although Haitian Kreyo`l in written form goes back as far as
the late 18th century (see Lefebvre (1998) for material on some
of these texts), Kreyo`l as a written language did not become
more commonplace until the 20th century, not achieving official
status in Haiti until 1961.
504
can be written as ?m, and can be attached to the word
or delimited by a space. Both m? and ?m appear in
some texts as just m. The same patterns hold for all
pronouns, and some function words as well. See Ta-
ble 1 for a list of these reductions.
Table 1: Sample Pronouns and Reductions
Pronoun Gloss Appears as
mwen I, me, mine m, ?m, m?
nou you (pl), us n, ?n, n?
ou you w, w?
li he, she, it l, l?, ?l
Additionally, writers of Kreyo`l use a large num-
ber of abbreviated forms for common expressions, a
kind of shorthand. For example, ave`n can be used to
represent ave`k nou, mandem can be used for mande
mwen, etc. Overall, the number of alternations and
multi-way ambiguities also increases the level of
noise and data sparsity. 9
So, even with a morphologically reduced lan-
guage like Kreyo`l, one has issues with data sparsity
beyond the mere lack of availability of data. This
compounds the low-data aspect of the language.
Adding in a multitude of morphological variants, as
one might encounter in a Turkic language, or worse,
in an Inuit language, would only make the problem
more severe. The big challenge for Crisis MT is not
only to deal with the data availability problem, but
once one has the data in hand, to deal with the re-
duction in the utility of that data caused by noise
and the multiplication of word forms. These pose
major challenges to our community, which can be
countered through additional research, a motivated
and active community, and scores of rapidly applied
heuristics and data repairs.
6 Research Areas to Counter Data
Sparsity
As noted, the major problems with low-resource MT
is the lack of data and various data issues that in-
crease the sparsity of data already in short supply.
What are the research challenges? How can we
make MT viable quickly for low-resource and si-
multaneously morphologically rich languages?
9For more details of the Haitian Kreyo`l translation systems
developed at Microsoft Research, please see Lewis (2010).
The following constitutes a rough list of solu-
tions, many of which map to very interesting re-
search problems:
? Crowdsourcing ? Beyond the use of crowd-
sourcing in the crisis context itself (e.g., to
translate or process text messages, much as
what was done by Mission 4636), novel tech-
niques for tapping the crowd could also be used
to add or repair data:
? Repairing and evaluation ? In this sce-
nario, the crowd would be used to repair
data that is obviously noisy, evaluate prob-
lems with particular data points, or even
make simple determinations as to whether
the data in question is actually in the lan-
guage(s) of interest or too noisy to use.
? Translating content, generating new data ?
Given crowd sourced, micro-tasking plat-
forms such as Amazon?s Mechanical Turk
and Crowdflower, one can now easily tap
the crowd to generate new data. The ma-
jor challenge will be identifying if speak-
ers of the target language(s) are available
on the desired platform, and if not, if they
could be motivated to particpate.10 Like-
wise, infrastructure and resources will be
needed to evaluate the quality of the re-
sulting translations (Zaidan and Callison-
Burch, 2011).
? Active Crowd Translation ? This method
combines active learning with crowd-
sourcing for annotation of parallel data in
comparable resources, and can be used
to increase the amount of data that is
found (Ambati et al, 2011). Active learn-
ing might be applicable to other crowd-
sourcing tasks as well, such as being used
in crowdsourcing for translating content
or repairing translated content.
? Tapping non-traditional sources ? Critical to
traditional approaches of SMT is parallel train-
ing data. Parallel data is difficult to impossible
to come by for a large number of the world?s
10Based on the results of an informal survey, there may be
speakers of a hundred or more languages on Mechanical Turk.

of the languages that may be available on Turk.
505
languages. Tapping non-traditional sources of
data can help increase the supply of ever valu-
able training data for a language:
? Mining comparable sources of data ? min-
ing comparable data for parallel data has
a long history, including mining compara-
ble sources for named entities (Udupa et
al., 2009; Irvine et al, 2010; Hewavitha-
rana and Vogel, 2008; Hewavitharana and
Vogel, 2011), mining Wikipedia for paral-
lel content, including sentences (Smith et
al., 2010), and many more too numerous
to list. There is always room for improve-
ment and hybridization in this space, as
well as tapping additional sources of data,
such as the volumes of noisy comparable
data on the Web.
? Monolingual ? More recent work has fo-
cused on mining monolingual sources of
data, treating MT as a decipherment prob-
lem (Ravi and Knight, 2011), rather than
a source-target mapping problem.
? Dictionary bootstraps and backoffs ? De-
spite the absence of context, dictionar-
ies can be useful, especially for resolving
out-of-vocabulary items (OOVs). Many
bilingual dictionaries also contain exam-
ple sentences, which can be harvested and
used in training.
? Field data from linguists ? Given that lin-
guists have variously studied a large per-
centage of the world?s languages, tapping
the supply of data that they have accu-
mulated could prove quite fruitful. Some
recent work tapping annotated bitexts (at
this time, for over 1,200 languages) pro-
duced by linguists may prove useful in
the future (Lewis and Xia, 2010), if for
nothing more than to provide information
about linguistic structure (e.g., morpho-
logical complexity or divergences, poten-
tial distortion rates, and structural diver-
gence (a la Fox (2002))). Engaging with
the documentary linguistic community
and providing tools to facilitate the col-
lection of data might produce additional
data, especially data where alignment is
assisted through human input (Monson et
al., 2008).
? Novel ways of countering data sparsity
? Systematizing data cleaning heuristics ?
Undoubtedly, the same kinds of filtra-
tion and data cleaning heuristics used for
Kreyo`l could prove useful for speeding
up the processing of data for new lan-
guages. Applying Machine Learning tech-
niques to data filtration and data cleaning
could aid and generalize the process, thus
decreasing overall latency from acquisi-
tion to training.
? Strategies to make the source look more
like the target (or vice versa) ? A corol-
lary to data sparsity is faulty word align-
ment, where low frequency words fail to
get good alignments because there is not
enough data to reinforce fairly weak hy-
potheses, or where source-target distor-
tion is high. Both problems disfavor what
alignments do exist. If the source and tar-
get are reordered so that one side more
closely matches the other, or one side is
?enriched? to be more like the other, one
can reduce distortion related effects, and
might also counter the large number of
forms in morphologically rich languages
(e.g., (Yeniterzi and Oflazer, 2010; Gen-
zel, 2010), and many others).
? Strategies to systematically deal with complex
morphology ? this is one on-going area of re-
search that could still net large returns, since,
even with some relatively high-data languages,
such as Finnish, data is made sparser due to the
multiplication of possible forms. There is too
long a literature to really do justice here, but
some recent work includes discrimitative lexi-
cons (Jeong et al, 2010), sub-word alignment
strategies (Bodrumlu et al, 2009), learning the
morphological variants in a language (Oflazer
and El-kahlout, 2007), using off-the-shelf mor-
phological tools, e.g., Morfessor 11, etc.
? Use syntax or linguistic knowledge in the
translation task ? By reducing the hypothe-
sis space for possible alignments, syntax-based
11http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/morpho/
506
approaches can do better in lower-data situa-
tions and can handle source-target discontinu-
ities better than straight phrase-based systems
(e.g., (Quirk and Menezes, 2006; Li et al,
2010)).
7 The MT Crisis Cookbook
Given the relatively narrow domain context of Cri-
sis MT?generally the needed vocabulary and data
should be centered on relief work, medical in-
teractions, and communicating with the affected
populations?it may be possible to approach Crisis
MT as we would MT for any domain (e.g., news,
government, etc.). With enough data relevant to a
particular domain or sub-domain (e.g., earthquake,
tsunami, nuclear disaster, flooding, etc.), it would
be possible to build the relevant translation memo-
ries (TMs) and train highly domain-specific MT en-
gines to produce translations of reasonable quality
and utility. Even with highly inflected languages, a
domain-specific approach may get around many of
the data sparsity issues.
It is also crucial that no data be thrown out. Re-
lief specific content that was relevant to an earlier
crisis can certainly contribute to subsequent crises.
Among these data are difficult to replicate sources
of data, such as SMS messages. This data would
constitute a highly domain specific set of data which
would only grow over time.
7.1 Outline of the Cookbook
The recipe for the MT Crisis Cookbook consists of
two parts:
1. The content that would be most useful in crisis
situations. This consists of relief-centric vocab-
ulary, phrases, sentences, and other material. It
should be in some common ?source? language,
likely English (English is a reasonable ?pivot?
in and out of many other languages, given the
ubiquity of English-to-X content).
2. The infrastructure to support relief workers,
aid agencies, and the affected population. As
made obvious in Haiti, an SMS messaging
infrastructure integrated into a crowd-sourced
translation infrastructure, proved to be crucial.
For future crises, this infrastructure should be
streamlined and have public MT APIs inte-
grated directly into it (to support first pass MT).
7.2 Cookbook Data
As noted in Section 5, one way to counter the data
sparsity problem is to build domain specific engines,
with a set of data ready-to-go in the event of a crisis.
This data, which would exist in English and possibly
other languages, would be translated into the target
language (if needed), distributed to to aid organiza-
tions (as needed), and used to train MT engines and
other language processing resources. The following
list constitutes a set of possible sources. It is by no
means complete (for instance, some resources spe-
cific to particular crisis types, e.g., floods, nuclear
disasters, etc. are not included), but it does repre-
sent a good central core of resources that should be
part of any Crisis Cookbook12 :
? Where There is No Doctor ? This is one of the
most recognized and widely used and useful
references in under-resourced regions around
the world. The publisher of the text, the Hespe-
rian Foundation, has already had the text trans-
lated into 75 languages, and it is available in
PDF as a free download from their website.13
? CMU Medical Domain Phrases, Sentences,
and Glossary ? Collected under the jointly
NSF/EU funded NESPOLE! and DIPLOMAT
projects (Frederking et al, 1997), this data con-
sists of common phrases and sentences that
would be useful in a crisis medical scenario,
and would be quite useful for training MT, as
it was for training the Kreyo`l engines. Only the
English side of this data would be relevant to
future crises.
? Anonymized Crisis-related SMS Messages ?
Relief-related SMS messages may be particu-
larly useful in future crises, since those col-
lected in a crisis scenario are likely to contain
content that transfers readily to similar crises.
A selected sample of the 80,000+ messages re-
sulting from the Haitian crisis could constitute
12Some of the resources listed here are under copyright.
There may need to be some negotiation with the copyright own-
ers to ensure that the texts can be used, and how they can be
used (e.g., to train MT, to be used in TMs, to be distributed in
hardcopy form, etc.).

a reasonable core of SMS messages that could
be added to over time.
? Red Cross Emergency Multilingual Phrase-
book ? A small, but highly focused, set of
phrases and questions useful in an emergency
medical context. Available in multiple lan-
guages.
? Emergency and Crisis Communication Vocab-
ulary ? An example bilingual set was prepared
by the Canadian Government in both French
and English14 , consisting of a small list of
?official? terms needed in crisis situations, and
their associated descriptions. Although the
terms on the Canadian site are translated and
defined only in English and French and have
a bias to the Canadian government nomecla-
ture, having such a list of terms from multi-
ple government agencies and their definitions
could prove useful for relief vocabulary as well
as for vocabulary needed for official announce-
ments.
? High Frequency Wikipedia Disaster Content
? This would consist of vocabulary that re-
curs across multiple related crisis pages on
wikipedia. The idea is to harvest those terms
that repeat across multiple pages of the same
?sub-domain? (e.g., those that cover events
with floods, earthquakes, nuclear disasters,
etc.), but document disasters in different lo-
cales, where cross-page repeated vocabulary is
favored (substracting out high-frequency vo-
cabulary that occurs elsewhere). This vocab-
ulary could be distilled automatically from a
set of relevant pages, and would likely contain
core vocabulary for specific crisis and disas-
ter contexts. For instance, shared vocabulary
between the Japanese, Indonesian, Pakistani,
and Haitian Earthquake pages might contain a
reasonable set of vocabulary relevant to earth-
quake crises as a whole.
7.3 Cookbook Infrastructure
The Cookbook infrastructure draws directly on what
was found to be useful in the Haitian Crisis. Here are
the infrastructural components we see as crucial:
14http://www.btb.gc.ca/publications/documents/crise-
crisis.pdf
? A crowd sourced microtasking infrastructure
to translate and route messages from the field.
This proved to be essential in Haiti. Hav-
ing such an infrastructure ready-to-go for fu-
ture crises would shave days off implementa-
tion and likely have profound effects on the ra-
pidity of the response.
? Integration of the APIs for the publically avail-
able MT services, such as Microsoft Transla-
tor and Google Translate, into the microtask-
ing and messaging infrastructure, enabling pro-
cessing of SMS messages, Twitter feeds, etc.
In this way, when any of these services deploy
MT for a given crisis language, the switch can
be flipped and first-pass can be MT activated at
a moment?s notice.
? A ready-to-go smart phone app that acts as a
crisis Translation Memory, which can be pop-
ulated with Cookbook content as it becomes
available. In this manner, rather than relying
on the distribution of paper copies of Cook-
book materials, relief workers on the ground
could just sync-up their mobile devices to get
the latest content. This is particularly impor-
tant in crisis locales where ?data plan? access
is limited, and phones will thus not necessarily
have online access to cloud based resources on
a regular basis.
8 A Sample Crisis Timeline
The following timeline is only meant to demonstrate
what might be possible with the right infrastructure
in place and the community fully engaged. The
mantra of ?every crisis is different? applies, and this
timeline should not be interpreted as a ?cookbook?
for a future event. All place and entity names are
intended to add realism; there was no intention to
leave anyone in or out.
Day 0 ? A massive earthquake hits the island nation
of Palladi.
Day 1 ? The first aid organizations arrive on the is-
land with food and humanitarian aid, although
only the two major cities are directly accessi-
ble. Thousands of Palladians are not reach-
able by aid organizations, and the exact num-
bers that are affected and their locations are not
known.
508
The native population of Palladians is nearly
80% monolingual. There is a dire need for Pal-
ladian interpreters, but also of translated Pal-
ladian content. Notified of the need for Pal-
ladian translations, MT community volunteers
begin efforts to collect and license data in Pal-
ladian. The relief community responds by ac-
tivating the crowd sourcing infrastructure used
in other relief scenarios. Researchers and disas-
ter response teams are notified at Microsoft Re-
search and Google Research of the critical need
for crisis content to be translated into Palladian.
Native Palladian speakers are being looked for
by all parties.
Day 2 ? As with the Haitian crisis, a text messag-
ing infrastructure is put in place such that text
messages can be received from the population
and routed to a crowd of rapidly assembling
volunteers. Since there is some internet ac-
cess, including via mobile phones, twitter feeds
are monitored. Until messages start arriving, a
small crowd of Palladian speakers begin trans-
lating content into Palladian, focused specifi-
cally on the Cookbook and off-the-shelf SMS
content.
The first text messages start arriving by late af-
ternoon. These text messages are routed di-
rectly to the text messaging and microtasking
infrastructure. The small but growing crowd
of Palladian translators begin translating this
growing tide of messages.
Day 3 ? The humanitarian information processing
community, with the support of many organiza-
tions and volunteers, releases the first sections
of the Crisis Cookbook. The Crisis Cookbook
is transmitted directly to aid organizations on
the ground in Palladi, and soft- and hard-copies
are distributed to aid workers as quickly as fea-
sible.
AT&T puts into place several cell towers with
satellite connectivity for areas that do not have
cell coverage. Within hours, text and twitter
messages from the field increase dramatically.
Day 4 ? Microsoft and Google release the first ver-
sions of their Palladian-English translators,
with ready access via their public APIs. Since
the text messaging infrastructure already has
both APIs integrated directly into the micro-
tasking and message processing infrastructure,
both engines are activated immediately, and all
messages are translated first by one or the other
engine, and the MT?d content along with the
original message are handed to volunteers.15
Translations are repaired, and routed directly to
aid organizations, and to the Google and Mi-
crosoft teams (for retraining models).
Day 5 ? Additional cookbook materials are trans-
lated. Researchers at Johns Hopkins locate a
stash of Palladian data at the Palladian Cen-
tral University. This data is posted at the CMU
site, and is immediately consumed by all par-
ties working on the MT problem.
Day 6 ? Researchers at University of Edinburgh de-
velop a novel algorithm for dealing with Palla-
dian vowel harmony, which has been a major
problem with Palladian MT, since data sparsity
is exacerbated by the problem. The Edinburgh
researchers publish the algorithm immediately
to their Web site, and notify both Microsoft and
Google.
Day 10 ? Armed with algorithmic improvements
and an increasing volume of data, machine
translated content is now achieving sufficient
quality to warrant passing it directly to aid or-
ganizations. Palladian volunteers now work
principally on the hard to translate cases (those
with high OOVs), and on post-response data
clean-up. The fruits of their labor result in iter-
ative improvements on the various MT engines
that have been deployed.
Day 11+ ? The deployment of language technolo-
gies, specifically MT, in the Palladian crisis re-
sults in saving untold thousands of lives. The
lessons learned in the Palladian earthquake will
be applied to future crises, and the translated
content produced by volunteers will be added
to the cookbook for use in the next crisis.
15Determining which engine to send translations to is a prob-
lem that should be resolved in advance. A combination of either
random selection or on-the-fly OOV calculations could be used
to determine routing.

9 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose that MT is an important
technology in crisis events, something that can and
should be an integral part of the rapid-response in-
frastructure. By integrating MT services directly
into a messaging infrastructure (whatever the type of
messages being serviced, e.g., text messages, Twit-
ter feeds, blog postings, etc.), MT can be used to
provide first pass translations into a majority lan-
guage, which can assist in triaging messages and
routing them to appropriate aid agencies. If done
right, MT can dramatically increase the speed by
which relief can be provided. To ensure that MT
is a standard tool in the arsenal of tools used in cri-
sis events, we propose a preliminary Crisis Cook-
book, the data contents of which could be translated
into the relevant language(s) by volunteers imme-
diately after a crisis event takes place. The result-
ing data can then be made available to relief groups
on the ground, as well as to providers of MT ser-
vices. We also note that there are significant con-
tributions that our community can make to relief ef-
forts through continued work on our research, espe-
cially that research which makes MT more viable for
under-resourced languages.
Credits
This paper is dedicated to the thousands of volun-
teers who worked selflessly for many, many hours
in aid of the people of Haiti. Without their help,
many hundreds more would have perished. We also
wish to express our deepest appreciation to all those
who have devoted their lives to aid people in need,
especially the first responders in crisis events. It is
our sincerest hope that that the small measures our
community can take to assist in relief efforts will
help make your jobs more effective, and that our ef-
forts will ultimately assist you and those you strive
to help.
