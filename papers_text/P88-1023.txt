Speakers convey much of the information hearers use to 
interpret discourse by varying prosodic features uch as 
PHRASING, PITCH ACCENT placement, TUNE, and PITCH 
P.ANGE. The ability to emulate such variation is crucial 
to effective (synthetic) speech generation. While text-to- 
speech synthesis must rely primarily upon structural in- 
formation to determine appropriate intonational features, 
speech synthesized from an abstract representation f the 
message to be conveyed may employ much richer sources. 
The implementation f an intonation assignment compo- 
nent for Direction Assistance, a program which generates 
spoken directions, provides a first approximation of how 
recent models of discourse structure can be used to control 
intonational variation in ways that build upon recent re- 
search in intonational meaning. The implementation fur- 
ther suggests ways in which these discourse models might 
he augmented to permit the assignment of appropriate 
intonational features. 
Introduction 
DIRECTION ASSISTANCE ! was written to provide spo- 
ken directions for driving between any two points in the 
Boston areal7\] over the telephone. Callers specify their 
origin and destination via touch-tone input. The program 
finds a route and synthesizes a spoken description of that 
route. Earlier versions of Direction Assistance xhibited 
notable deficiencies in prosody when a simple text-to- 
speech system was used to produce such descriptions\[6\], 
because prosody depends in part on discourse-level phe- 
nomena such as topic structure and information status 
which are not generally inferrable from text, and thus 
*The inton~tion,d component described here was completed at 
AT&T Bell Laboratories in the summcT of 1987. We th~nk Janet 
Pie~Tehtunbert and Gregory Ward for valuable discussions.

Tom Trobaugh in 1985 at the Thinking Maf_~ines Corporation of 
Cambridge. 
cannot be correctly produced by the text to speech sys- 
tem. 
To alleviate some of these problems, we modified Direc- 
tion Assistance to make both attentional and intentional 
information about the route description available for the 
assignment of intonational features. With this informa- 
tion, we generate spoken directions using the Bell Labo~ 
ratories Text-to-Speech System\[21\] in which pitch range, 
accent placement, phrasing, and tune can be varied to 
communicate attentional and intentional structure. The 
implementation f this intonation assignment component 
provides a first approximation of how recent models of 
discourse structure can be used to control intonational 
variation in ways that build upon recent research in into- 
national meaning. Additionally, it suggests ways in which 
these discourse models must be enhanced in order to per- 
mlt the assignment of appropriate intonational features. 
In this paper, we first discuss some previous attempts 
to synthesize speech from representations other than sim- 
ple text. We next discuss the work on discourse structure, 
on English phonology, and on intonational meaning which 
we assume for this study. We then give a brief overview 
of Direction Assistance. Next we describe how Direction 
Assistance represents discourse structures and uses them 
to generate appropriate prosody. 
Previous Studies 
Only a few voice interactive systems have attempted to 
exploit intonation in the interaction. The Telephone En- 
quiry Service (TES) \[19\] was designed as a framework 
for applications uch as database inquiries, games, and 
calculator functions. Application programmers specified 
text by phonetic symbols and intonation by a code which 
extended Halliday's\[ll\] intonation scheme. While TES 
gave programmers a high-level means of varying prosody, 
it made no attempt o derive prosody automatically from 
an abstract representation. 
187 
Young and Fallside's\[20\] Speech Synthesis from Con- 
cept (SSC) system first demonstrated the gains to be had 
by providing more than simple text as input to a speech 
synthesizer. SSC passed a network representation f syn- 
tactic structure to the synthesizer. Syntactic information 
could thus inform accenting and phrasing decisions. How- 
ever, structural information alone is insufficient to deter- 
mine intonational features\[10\], and SSC does not use se- 
mantic or pragmatic/discourse information. 
Discourse and Intonation 
The theoretical foundations of the current work are three: 
Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, Pierre- 
humbert's theory of English intonation, and Hirschberg 
and Pierrehumbert's studies of intonation and discourse. 
ing a discourse is reconstructing the DP, DSPs and rela- 
tions among them. 
Attentional structure in this model is an abstraction 
of 'focus of attention', in which the set of salient entities 
changes as the discourse unfolds. 2 A given discourse's 
attentional structure is represented as a stack of FOCUS 
SPACES, which contain representations of entities refer- 
enced in a given DS, such as 'flywheel' or 'allen-head 
screws', as well as the DS's DSP. The accessibility of an 
entity m as, for pronominal reference m depends upon 
the depth of its containing focus space. Deeper spaces are 
less accessible. Entities may be made inaccessible if their 
focus space is popped from the stack. 
I n tonat iona l  Features  and  the i r  In terpre -  
ta t ion  
Mode l ing  D iscourse  S t ructure  
Grosz and Sidner\[9\] propose that discourse be understood 
in terms of the purposes that underly it (INTENTIONAL 
STRUCTURE) and the entities and attributes which are 
salient during it (ATTENTIONAL STRUCTURE). Ill this ac- 
count, discourses are analyzed as hierarchies of segments, 
each of which has an underlying Discourse Segment  
Purpose  (DSP) intended by the speaker. All DSPs con- 
tribute to the overall D iscourse Purpose  (DP) of the 
discourse. For example, a discourse might have as its 
DP something like 'intend that Hearer put together an 
air compressor', while individual segments might have as 
contributing DSP's 'intend that Hearer remove the fly- 
wheel' or 'intend that Hearer attach the conduit o  the 
motor'. Such DSP's may in turn be r.epresented as hier- 
archies of intentions, such as 'intend that a hearer loosen 
the allen-head screws', and 'intend that Hearer locate the 
wheel-puller'. DSPs a and b may be related to one an- 
other in two ways: a may DOMINATE b if the DSP of 
a is partially fulfilled by the DSP of b (equivalently, b 
CONTRIBUTES TO a). So, 'intend that Hearer remove 
the flywheel' dominates 'intend that Hearer loosen the 
allen-head screws', and the latter contributes to the for- 
mer. Segment a SATISFACTION-PRECEDES b if the DSP 
of a must be achieved in order for the DSP of b to be 
successful. ' Intend that Hearer locate the wheel-puller' 
satisfaction-precedes 'intend that Hearer use the wheel- 
puller', and so on. Such intentional structure has been 
studied most extensively in task-oriented domains, such 
as instruction in assembling machinery, where speaker in- 
tentions appear to follow the structure of the task to some 
extent. In Grosz and Sidner's model, part of understand- 
This model of discourse is employed for expository 
purposes by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert\[12\] in their 
work on the relationship between intonational and dis- 
course features. In Pierrehumbert's theory of English 
phonolog~v\[16\], intonational contours are represented as 
sequences of high (H) and low (L) tones (local max- 
ima and minima) in the FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (f0). 
Pitch accents fall on the stressed syllables of some lexical 
items, and may be simple H or L tones or complex tones. 
The four bitonal accents in English (H*-}-L, H-I-L*, 
L*-I-H, L-I-H*) differ in the order of tones and in which 
tone is aligned with the stressed syllable of the accented 
i tem- -  the asterisk indicates alignment with stress. Pitch 
accents mark items as intonationally prominent and con- 
vey the relative 'newness' or 'salience' of items in the dis- 
course. For example, in (la), right is accented (as 'new'), 
while in (lb) it is deaccented (as 'old'). 
(I) a. Take a right, onto Concord Avenue. 
b. Take another right, onto Magazine Street. 
Different pitch accents convey different meanings: For ex- 
ample, a L-t-H* on right in (la) may convey 'contrastive- 
ness', as after the query So, you take a left ontoConcord?. 
A simple H* is more likely when the direction of the turn 
has not been questioned. A L*~H,  however, can convey 
incredulity or uncertainty about the direction. 
INTERMEDIATE PHRASES are composed of one or more 
pitch accents, plus an additional PHRASE ACCENT (H or 
L), which controls the pitch from the last pitch accent to 
~See \[1\] and \[3\] for earlier AI work on global and local focus. 
188 
the end of the phrase. INTONATIONAL PHRASES consist 
of one or more intermediate phrases, plus a BOUNDARY 
TONE, also H or L, which falls at the edge of the phrase; 
we indicate boundary tones with an '%',  as H%. Phrase 
boundaries are marked by lengthened final syllables and 
(perhaps) a pause - -  as well as by tones. Variations in 
phrasing may convey structural relationships among el- 
ements of a phrase. For example, (2) uttered as two 
phrases favors a non-restrictive r ading in which the first 
right happens to be onto Central Park. 
(2) Take the first right \[,\] onto Central Park. 
Uttered as a single phrase, (2) favors the restrictive read- 
ing, instructing the driver to find the first right which 
goes onto Central Park. 
TUNES, or intonational contours, have as their domain 
the intonational phrase. While the meaning of tunes ap- 
pears to be compositional w from the meanings of their 
pitch accents, phrase accents, and boundary tones\[15\], 
certain broad generalizations may be made about par- 
ticular tunes in English. Phrases ending in L H% ap- 
pear to convey some sense that the phrase is to be com- 
pleted by another phrase. Phrases ending in L L% ap- 
pear more 'declarative' than 'interrogative' phrases end- 
ing in H H%. Phrases composed of sequences of H*-I-L 
accents are often used didactically. 
The PITCH RANGE of a phrase is (roughly) the distance 
between the maximum f0 value in the phrase (modulo 
segmental effects and FINAL LOWERING effects) and the 
speaker's BASELINE, defined for each speaker as the low- 
est point reached in normal speech over all utterances. 
Variation in pitch range can communicate he topic struc- 
ture of a discourse\[12, 18\]; increasing the pitch range of a 
phrase over prior phrases can convey the introduction of 
a new topic, and decreasing the pitch range over a prior 
phrase can convey the continuation of a subtopic. After 
any bitonal pitch accent pitch range is compressed. This 
compression, called catathesls ,  or downstep,  extends to 
the nearest phrase boundary. Another process, called FI- 
NAL LOWEP~NG, involves a compression of the pitch range 
during the last half second or so of a 'declarative' utter- 
ances. The amount of final lowering present for utterance 
appears to correlate with the amount of 'finality' to be 
conveyed by the utterance. That is, utterances that end 
topics appear to exhibit more final lowering, while utter- 
ances within a topic segment may have little or none. 
In tonat ion  in D i rec t ion -G iv ing  
To identify potential genre-specific ntonational charac- 
teristics of direction-giving, we performed informal pro- 
duction studies, with speakers reading sample texts of 
directions similar to those generated by Direction As- 
sistance. From acoustic analysis of this data, we noted 
first that speakers tended to use H*+L accents quite 
frequently, in utterances like that whose pitch track ap- 
pears in Figure 1. The use of such contours has been 
associated in the literature with 'didactic' or 'pedantic' 
contexts. Hence, the propensity for using this contour in 
giving directions eems not inappropriate to emulate. 
We also noted tendencies for subjects to vary pitch 
range in ways similar to proposals mentioned above 
that is, to indicate large topic shifts by increasing pitch 
range and to use smaller pitch ranges where utterances 
appeared to 'continue' a previous topic. And we noted 
variation in pausal duration which was consistent with 
the notion that speakers produce longer pauses at major 
topic boundaries than before an utterance that contin- 
ues a topic. However, these informal studies were simply 
intended to produce guidelines. 
In the intonation assignment component we added to 
Direction Assistance, pitch accent placement, phrasing, 
tune, and pitch range and final lowering are varied as 
noted above to convey information status, structural 
information, relationships among utterances, and topic 
structure. We will now describe how Direction Assistance 
works in general, and, in particular, how it uses this com- 
ponent in generating spoken directions. 
Direction Assistance 
Direction Assistance has four major components. The 
Locat ion F inder  queries the user to obtain the origin 
and destination of the route. The Route  F inder  then 
finds a 'best' route, in terms of drivability and describabil- 
ity. Once a route is determined, the Descr iber  generates 
a text describing the route, which the Nar ra tor  reads to 
the user. In the work reported here, we modified the 
Describer to generate an abstract representation of the 
route description and replaced the Narrator with a new 
component, he Talker, which computes prosodic values 
from these structures and passes text augmented with 
commands controlling prosodic variation to the speech 
synthesizer.

Generat ing  text  and  d iscourse  s t ruc tures  
The Describer's representation f a route is called a tour .  
A tour is a sequence of acts  to be taken in following the 
route. Acts represent something the driver must do in 
following the route. Act types include s tar t  and stop,  for 
the beginning and ending of the tour, and various kinds 
of turns. A rich classification of turns is required in order 
to generate natural text. A 'fork' should be described 
differently from a 'T '  and from a highway exit. Turning 
acts include enter  and exit  from a limited access road, 
merge,  fork, u - turn ,  and ro tary .  
For each act type, there is a corresponding descriptive 
schema to produce text describing that act. Text gen- 
eration also involves selecting an appropriate cue for the 
act. There are four types of cues: Action cues signal 
when to perform an act, such as "When you reach the 
end of the road, do x ' .  Confirmatory cues are indica- 
tors that one is successfully following the route, such as 
"You'll cross x" or "You'll see y ' .  Warning cues caution 
the driver about possible mistakes. Failure cues to de- 
scribe the consequences of mistakes (e.g. "If you see x, 
you have gone too far ' )  have not yet been implemented. 
In general, there will be several different items potentially 
useful as action or confirmatory cues. The Describer se- 
lects the one which is most easily recognized (e.g. a bridge 
crossing) sad which is close to the act for which it is a 
cue .  
Descriptive schemas are internally organized into syn- 
tactic constituents. Some constituents are constant, and 
others, e.g. street names and direction of turns, axe slots 
to be filled by the Describer from the tour. Constituents 
axe further grouped into one or more (potential) intona- 
tional phrases. Each phrase will have a pitch range, a pre- 
ceding pause duration, a phrase accent, and a boundary 
tone assigned by the Talker. Phrases that end utterances 
will also have a final lowering percentage. Where schemas 
include more than one intonational phrase, relationships 
among these phrases are documented in the schema tem- 
plate so that they may be preserved when intonational 
features are assigned. 
Intentional structure is also represented at the level of 
the intonational phrase. Unlike in Grosz and Sidner's 
model, a single phrase may represent a discourse seg- 
ment. This departure stems from our belief that, follow- 
ing \[12, 15\], certain intonational contours can communi- 
cate relationships among DSP's. 3 Certain relationships

among DSP's are specified within schemas; others are de- 
termined from the general task structure indicated by the 
domain and the particular task structure indicated by the 
current path. 
Constituents may be annotated with semantic infor- 
mation to be used in determining information status. Se- 
mantic annotations include the type of the object and 
a pointer (to the internal representation for the object 
designated). For each type of object, there is a predicate 
which can test two objects of that type for co-designation. 
For example, for purposes of reference or accenting we 
may want to treat 'street' and 'avenue' as similar. 
Each DS has associated with it a focus space. Following 
\[2\], a focus space consists of a set of FORWARD-LOOKING 
CENTERS, potentially salient discourse ntities and mod- 
ifiers. Focus spaces are pushed and popped from the FO- 
CUS STACK as the description is generated, according to 
the relationships among their associated DS's. 
As an example, the generator for the rotary act ap- 
pears in figure 2. This schema generates two sentences, 
second of which is a conjunction. One slot in this 
schema is taken by an NP constituent for the rotary. 
The make-np-const i tuent  routine handles agreement 
between the article and the noun. A second slot is filled 
with an expression giving the approximate angular dis- 
tance traveled around the rotary. The actual value de- 
pends upon the specifics of the act. A third slot in this 
schema is filled by the name of the street reached after 
taking the rotary. The choice of referring expression for 
the street name depends upon the type of street. No 
cues are generated here, on the grounds that a rotary is 
unmistakable. 
Assigning Intonational Features 
The TAlicer employes variation in pitch range, pausal du- 
ration, and final lowering ratio to reflect he topic struc- 
ture of the description, or, the relationship among DS's as 
reflected in the relationship among DSP's. Following the 
proposals of \[12\], we implement this variation by assigned 
each DS an embeddedness level, which is just the depth 
of the DS within the discourse tree. Pitch range decreases 
with embeddedness. In Grosz and Sidner's terms, for ex- 
ample, for DS1 and DS2, with DSPz dominating DSP2, 
we assign DS1 a larger pitch range than DS2. Similarly, if 
DSP2 dominates DSP3, DSs will have a still smaller pitch 
range than DS2. Sibling DS's will thus share a common 
pitch range. Pitch variation is perceived logarithmically, 
so pitch range decreases as a constant fraction (.9) at each

level, but never falls below a minimum value above the 
baseline. Also following \[12\], we vary final lowering to 
indicate the level of embeddedness of the segment com- 
pleted by the current utterance. We largely suspend final 
lowering for the current utterance when it is followed by 
an utterance with greater embedding, to produce a sense 
of topic continuity. Where the subsequent u terance has a 
lesser degree of embedding than the current utterance, we 
increase final lowering proportionally. So, for example, if
the current utterance were followed by an utterance with 
embedding level 0 (i.e., no embedding, indicating amajor 
topic shift), we would give the current utterance maxi- 
mal final lowering (here, .87). Pansal duration is greatest 
(here, 800 msec) between segments at the least embedded 
level, and decreases by 200 msec for each level of embed- 
ding, to a minimum of 100 msec between phrases. Of 
course, the actual values assigned in the current applica- 
tion are somewhat arbitrary. In assigning final lowering, 
as pitch range and intervening pausal duration, it is the 
relative differences that are important. 
Accent placement is determined according to relative 
salience and 'newness' of the mentioned item.\[12, 14, 5\] 
(We employ Prince's\[17\] Givens, or given-salient notion 
here to distinguish 'given' from 'new' information. How- 
ever, it would be possible to extend this to include hi- 
erarchically related items evoked in a discourse as also 
given, or 'Chafe-given'\[17\], were such possibilities present 
in our domain.) Certain object types and modifier types 
in the domain have been declared to be potentially salient. 
When such an item is to be mentioned in the path descrip- 
tion, it is first sought in the current focus space and its 
ancestors. In general, if it is found, it is deaccented; oth- 
erwise it receives a pitch accent. If the object is not a 
191 
potentially salient type, then, if it is a function word, it 
is deaccented, otherwise it is taken to be a miscellaneous 
content word and receives an accent by default. In some 
cases, we found that -- contra current theories of focus 
-- items should remain deaccentable even when the focus 
spaces containing them have been popped from the focus 
stack. In particular, items in the current focus space's 
preceding sibling appear to retain their 'givenness'. Re- 
analysis to place both occurrences in the same segment 
or to ensure that the first is in a parent segment seemed 
to lack independent justification. So, we decided to allow 
items to remain 'given' across sibling segment boundaries, 
and extended our deaccenting possibilities accordingly. 
We vary phrasing primarily to convey structural infor- 
mation. Structural distinctions uch as those presented 
by example (2) are accomplished in this way. 
Intentional structure is conveyed by varying intona- 
tional contour as well as pitch range, final lowering, and 
pausal duration. A phrase which required 'completion' by 
another phrase is assigned a low phrase accent and a high 
boundary tone (this combination is commonly known as 
CONTINUATION RISE).\[15\] For example, since we gener- 
ate VP conjunctions primarily to indicate temporal or 
causal relationship (e.g Stay on Main Street for about 
ninety yards, and cross the Longfellow Bridge.), we use 
continuation rise in such cases on the first phrase. 
The sample text in Figure 3 ia generated by the sys- 
tem. Note that commands to the speech synthesizer have 
been simplified for readability as follows: 'T '  indicates 
the topline of the current intonational phrase; 'F '  indi- 
cates the amount of final lowering; 'D '  corresponds to the 
duration of pause between phrases; 'N* '  indicates a pitch 
accent of type N; other words are not accented. Phrase 
accents are represented by simple H or L, and boundary 
tones are indicated by %. The topic structure of the text 
is indicated by indentation. 
Note that pitch range, final lowering, and pauses be- 
tween phrases are manipulated to enforce the desired 
topic structure of the text. Pitch range is decreased to re- 
fleet the beginning of a subtopic; phrases that continue a 
topic retain the pitch range of the preceding phrase. Final 
lowering is increased to mark the end of topics; for exam- 
ple, the large amount of final lowering produced on the 
last phrase conveys the end of the discourse, while lesser 
amounts of lowering within the text enhance the sense of 
connection between its parts. Pauses between clauses are 
also manipulated so that lesser pauses separate clauses 
which are to be interpreted as more closely related to one 
another. For example, the segment beginning with You'll 
come to a rotary.., is separated from the previous dis-

Summary 
We have described how structural, semantic, and dis- 
course information can be represented to permit the prin- 
cipled assignment of pitch range, accent placement and 
type, phrasing, and pause in order to generate spoken 
directions with appropriate intonational features. We 
have tested these ideas by modifying the text genera- 
tion component of Direction Assistance to produce an ab- 
stract representation f the information to be conveyed. 
This 'message-to-speech' approach to speech synthesis 
has clear advantages over simple text-to-speech synthe- 
sis, since the generator 'knows' the meanings to be con- 
veyed. This application, while over-simplifying the rela- 
tionship between discourse information and intonational 
features to some extent, nonetheless demonstrates that it 
should be possible to assign more appropriate prosodic 
192 
features automatically from an abstract representation f 
the meaning of a text. Further research in intonational 
meaning and in the relationship of that meaning to as- 
pects of discourse structure should facilitate progress to- 
ward this goal.
