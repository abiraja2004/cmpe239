Abstract
Korean Word Associations (KorWA) were 
collected to build a semantic network for the 
Korean language. A graphic representation 
approach of applying coefficients to complex 
networks allows us to discern the semantic 
structures within words. A semantic network 
of the KorWA was found to exhibit the scale-
free property in its degree distribution. The 
growth of the network around hub words was 
also confirmed through two experimental 
phases. As an issue for further research, we 
suggest that the present results may yield in-
sights for computational neurolinguistics, as a 
semantic network of word association norms 
can bridge the gap between information about 
lexical co-occurrences derived from a corpora 
and anatomical networks as a basis for map-
ping out neural activations. 
1 Introduction 
Language is an intricate cognitive system. The 
mental system, called a grammar by linguists, al-
lows human beings to form and interpret the 
sounds, words, and sentences of their language. 
The system is often broken down into several 
components, such as phonetics, phonology, mor-
phology, syntax, and semantics (O'Grady et al 
2005). Depending on one?s concerns, the basic 
elements of each level (i.e. phones, syllables, mor-
phemes, words, or sentences) become the constitu-
ents of linguistic networks of sound patterns, 
morphological structures, or syntactic organiza-
tions. Parse trees, for instance, which are often 
used in analyzing the syntactic structures of sen-
tences, employ links to represent the syntagmatic 
relationships between words. However, focusing 
on the processes of conceptualizing feelings, ex-
periences, and perceptions and of encoding them in 
words (namely, lexicalization), linguists have fre-
quently drawn another kind of linguistic network 
substantiated as a map of words projecting seman-
tic structures and relations onto an Euclidian space 
from a paradigmatic perspective. In that sense, 
word association data is attractive in terms of ease 
of data manipulation, especially when making a 
graph from a list of word pairs. Moreover, the tools 
for analyzing complex networks have been often 
applied to analyzing the structural features within 
large-scale word association data and to mining 
lexical knowledge from them. 
Since Galton (1880), word association has been 
used as an empirical method for observing thought 
processes, memory, and mental states within clini-
cal and cognitive psychology (Deese, 1965). From 
a linguistic perspective, word associations are un-
doubtedly valuable language resources because 
they are rich sources of linguistic knowledge and 
lexical information. The data has some unique 
characteristics that are very interesting and useful 
for cultural studies, reflecting the life styles, social, 
cultural and linguistic backgrounds of the native 
speakers who contributed to the data collections.  
Such information could be particularly useful for 
further applications not only within semantic stud-
ies but also for intelligent information retrieval, 
brain research, and language learning. 
In short, so-called word association norms are 
crucial as large-scale paradigmatic corpora. They 
consist of word pair data based on psychological 
experiments where the participants are typically 
asked to provide a semantically-related response 
word that comes to mind upon presentation of a 
stimulus word. Two well-known word association 
data for English are the University of South Florida 
word association, rhyme and word fragment norms 
27
(Nelson et al, 1998) and the Edinburgh Word As-
sociation Thesaurus of English (EAT; Kiss et al, 
1973). For Japanese there are Ishizaki's Associa-
tive Concept Dictionary (IACD) (Okamoto and 
Ishizaki, 2001) and the Japanese Word Association 
Database (JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2006, 2007). Util-
izing computational linguistic techniques that aim 
to mathematically analyze their structures, raw as-
sociation data is often transformed into some form 
of graph or complex network representation, where 
the vertices stand for words and the edges indicate 
an associative relationship (Miyake et al, 2007). 
Such techniques of graph representation and their 
analysis allow us to discern the patterns of connec-
tivity within large-scale resources of linguistic 
knowledge and to perceive the inherent relation-
ships between words and word groups. 
However, despite a long history of word associa-
tion studies and the valuable contributions of such 
data to cognitive science, comprehensive, large-
scale databases of Korean word association norms 
have been seriously inadequate. In one study, Lee 
(1970) surveyed word associations based on 30 
adjectives and 29 words representing colors, tar-
geting 40 university students and analyzed the re-
sponse words for associative tendencies in terms of 
gender and grammatical word classes. More re-
cently, Shin (1998) attempted to categorize words 
by conceptual systems in order to construct a lexi-
cal dictionary supporting foreign language learners. 
Although her data differs from word association 
norms and is not available as an accessible digital 
database for academic purpose, the semantic clas-
sification of the words can be exploited in com-
plementing the analysis of Korean semantic 
networks.  
A collection of Korean word associations (for 
short, KorWA) was planned and conducted with 
the strong motivation of constructing a worthwhile 
database of Korean word associations as a kind of 
resource that has multiple applications in a number 
of areas such as lexicography, language education, 
artificial intelligent, natural language processing, 
and cultural study.  Moreover, we intend to share 
the database on the web to foster these various po-
tential utilities. 
  In this paper, KorWA is represented into se-
mantic networks and examined by some combina-
torial methods in linguistics. The details are 
presented from the whole process of collecting the 
data to the results of the analysis based on the the-
ory of complex networks. Furthermore, this paper 
briefly discusses another important characteristic, 
dynamics in scale-free networks, which has re-
cently attracted much attention in this research 
field. Finally we will mention the applicability of 
the graph-based analysis developed here to the fu-
ture potential researches of the computational neu-
rolinguistics. 
2 Korean word associations 
2.1 Design of Experiment 
Preparation of an association experiment begins 
with the selection of a stimulus word set that is to 
be presented to the respondent in order to initiate 
their association process.  Determining the stimu-
lus word set is a crucial part in designing the ex-
periment, as associative responses are greatly 
influenced by the characteristics of the presented 
words, in particular, the stimulus word familiarity 
influences response heterogeneity, variability, rela-
tional categories, and reaction times (Deese 1965). 
For the experiment of Korean word associations, 
we referred to a list of 5,000 Korean basic words 
(Seo et al 1998), which was derived from the 
Yonsei Corpora consisting of 42,644,891 words as 
of 1998 [ILIS].  From the list, we compiled a list of 
3,951 words, consisting of 2,628 nouns, 1,006 
verbs, and 317 adjectives. 
One hundred and thirty-two native Korean stu-
dents (71 males and 61 females) at Daejon Univer-
sity, South Korea voluntarily participated in the 
experiment.  The students were mainly from the 
departments of Korean language and literature 
(54%), physical therapy (30%), and philosophy 
(11%).  More than 70% of the students had educa-
tional background in the humanities.  Most of the 
students (93%) were in their 20s; 82% between 20 
and 25 years old and 11% between 26 and 30 years 
old.  14% of students answered that on average 
they read more than five books in a month. The 
task was conducted on the campus of Daejeon 
University from September 2007 to February 2008. 
It was a traditional pen-and-paper based task. Un-
der the control of an instructor, each session of the 
task lasted for 30 minutes. 
In the task, participants were instructed to write 
down the response words that came to mind when 
they looked at the presented words. We asked the 
subjects to write down all the words that they 
28
could think of from the presented words. This pro-
cedure is called the continuous free association 
task, differing from the discrete association task 
where the subject is asked to only write down their 
first response (Cramer 1968). 
As a means of naturally displaying continuous 
associations, the respondents were asked to map 
out their responses. That is, they drew a kind of 
associative map for a given word, by adding a line 
when they made an association and numbering the 
responses according to the order in which they 
came to mind from the stimulus word. In the ex-
periment, an A5 size booklet was distributed to the 
participants. The booklet had 66 pages printed on 
one-side, including 2 front-back cover pages.  
 
 
Figure 1. Instructions about the task and example 
 
The first 4 pages contained instructional informa-
tion; (1) a brief description of the experiment?s 
purpose and its method, (2) a short survey for basic 
respondent information (gender, age, major, and 
number of books read in a month), (3) an example 
illustrating what to do in the task (shown in Figure 
1), and (4) one practice before the task. Then, the 
remaining 60 pages were for the word association 
task, printed with one word per page. Thus, each 
participant was asked to provide word association 
responses for 60 words. 
In total, 132 booklets were prepared for the task. 
A list of 60 words for each booklet was randomly 
extracted from the 3,951 stimulus set. Apart from 
six of the 132 sets, the lists included 40 nouns, 15 
verbs, and 5 adjectives. The others had slightly 
different numbers of the syntactic categories. 
However, eventually each stimulus word was 
planned to be presented to up to two subjects. 
As the result of approximately 6-month period 
of data collection, we obtained 28,755 responses in 
total for the 3,942 stimulus words (from the origi-
nal stimulus set, nine words failed to elicit any 
word associations). The 28,755 responses (tokens) 
consisted of 11,275 distinct words (types). Each 
item was presented to two respondents. 
The KorWA database (Figure 2) was con-
structed from the collected word association re-
sponses. The data is arranged into six fields; (1) the 
part of speech of the stimulus word, (2) the stimu-
lus word, (3) the part of speech of the response, (4) 
response order, (5) raw form of the response, and 
(6) response word in standard form.

2.2 Basic Analysis 
The Korean word association data collected is 
briefly summarized here in terms of the relations 
between the stimulus words and the responses to-
gether with some basic statistics. The participants 
produced on average 218 responses (standard de-
viation = 63.8, ranging from 98 to 482) for the 
complete set of 60 words in the free association 
task, which corresponds to 3.6 responses per 
stimulus word. Because each stimulus item was 
presented to two respondents, each stimulus has on 
average 7.3 association responses. 
29
As already mentioned, our task was the continu-
ous free association task where the respondent was 
allowed to provide more than one response, so 
there is the possibility of chaining responses where 
some association responses are elicited by prior 
responses. The response set of 28,755 tokens in-
cludes all such responses. Furthermore, it is possi-
ble to extract the primary responses that were 
given as the first response produced for each 
stimulus word. In doing that, it is possible to con-
vert the continuous free association task condition 
to the discrete association task employed in other 
existing data. The primary associates for the 3,942 
stimulus are 7,550 word tokens (4,197 types). The 
associations seem to be related to the grammatical 
classes of the stimulus.  Ervin (1961) reports that 
many associations tend to have the same gram-
matical class as the stimulus word. Similarly, Jen-
kins (1954) and Saporta (1955) provide an 
interesting way of classifying association struc-
tures into two modes, i.e. paradigmatic associa-
tions and syntagmatic ones. In the former mode, 
the stimulus and response fit a common grammati-
cal paradigm. For example, the word ACTION 
yields the associates of WORDS, LIFE, 
MOVEMENT, MOTION, GAME, and so on, 
which are not likely to occur as sequences in eve-
ryday English. In the latter case, the stimulus and 
response are generally contiguous, occupying dif-
ferent positions within phrases or sentences. 
Namely, they often form sequences, as in the rela-
tions between the stimulus word of 
ADMINISTRATIVE and its common associates of 
DUTY, JOB, CONTROL, DISCIPLINE, POWER, 
BUREAUCRATS, POSITION, AGENCY, 
ENTITY, SCHOOL, BOSS, GOVERNMENT, 
RULE, etc. (Deese 1965). Deese (1962) clarified 
the relative frequencies of paradigmatic and syn-
tagmatic associations among the grammatical 
classes of English, especially with nouns, verbs, 
adjectives, and adverbs in his study. He observed 
that the tendency towards paradigmatic or syntag-
matic association varied with word class; nouns are 
dominantly paradigmatic, while adjectives and 
verbs tend to be both paradigmatic and syntag-
matic. In the case of adjectives, it is a particularly 
interesting tendency for the association types to 
have a strong correlation with frequency of usage. 
That is to say, for common adjectives, associations 
are more likely to be paradigmatic (e.g. for HOT, 
associates such as COLD, WARM, and COOL 
more frequently occur than WOMEN, WEATHER, 
and the like), while uncommon adjectives are more 
syntagmatic (e.g. for ADMINISTRATIVE, associ-
ates such as DUTY, GOVERNMENT, and RULE 
are more often produced than SUPERVISORY, 
EXECUTIVE, and so on). What is more, most 
paradigmatic associates to adjectives are either 
synonymous with the stimulus (COLD COOL) or 
the opposite of the stimulus (COLD HOT). Com-
mon adjectives overwhelmingly have more anto-
nyms as their response, but relatively low-frequent 
adjectives have more synonym associations. 
A similar tendency is observed in our data, 
which included three types of grammatical class 
among the stimulus items, with nouns, verbs, and 
adjectives, covering 66.5%, 25.5%, and 8% of the 
stimulus set respectively. The different proportions 
of the word classes reflects their frequencies within 
the Yonsei corpora, i.e. among the 5,000 most fre-
quent words, there is a much larger number of 
nouns, compared to verbs and adjectives. By tag-
ging the responses with parts of speech data during 
the course of constructing the database, we can 
analyze the distributions of grammatical categories 
among the responses. The responses were over-
whelmingly nouns (78%), followed by adjectives 
(7%), proper nouns (4.5%) and verbs (4.4%) in 
descending order. Within the primary response list, 
the distributions of word class are not greatly dif-
ferent, with 79% nouns, 6.7% adjectives, 4.8% 
verbs, 3.9% proper nouns, and around 6% others. 
Corresponding to the grammatical class of the 
stimulus specifically, nouns are also the dominant 
responses. When considering just the primary re-
sponses, noun stimulus elicited mostly noun re-
sponses (80%), followed by adjectives (6%), 
proper nouns (5%), and verbs (3%); verb stimulus 
produced around 80% noun associates, 10% verbs 
and 4% adjectives; while for adjective stimulus, 
there were 70% noun responses, 19% adjectives, 
and 2% verbs. In short, we found a majority of 
noun noun, verb noun, and adjective noun com-
binations within the stimulus response relations. 
This demonstrates the association tendency for 
nouns to strongly elicit paradigmatic associations, 
as seen from the principal noun noun relations, 
while verbs and adjectives tend to yield more syn-
tagmatic associations, as seen from the major rela-
tions of verb noun and adjective noun. 
2.3 Network Analysis (1) 
30
Degrees:  Recently, a number of studies have ap-
plied graph theory approaches in investigating lin-
guistic knowledge resources. For instance, instead 
of word frequency based computations, Dorow, et 
al (2005) utilize graph clustering techniques as 
methods of detecting lexical ambiguity and of ac-
quiring semantic classes. Steyvers and Tenenbaum 
(2005) conducted a noteworthy study that exam-
ined the structural features of three semantic net-
works (free association norms of Nelson et al, 
Roget's thesaurus, and WordNet). By calculating a 
range of statistical features, including the average 
shortest paths, diameters, clustering coefficients, 
and degree distributions, they observed interesting 
similarities between three networks in terms of 
their scale-free patterns of connectivity and small-
world structures. Following their basic approach, 
we analyze the characteristics of the semantic net-
work representation of KorWA by calculating the 
statistical features of the graph coefficients, such as 
degree and degree distribution. 
The semantic network representation of the 
word association network is constructed by repre-
senting the words as nodes and associative pairing 
information for words as edges. The degree (D) of 
a node denotes the number of edges that a node has. 
An undirected graph is structured by the edges, 
while a directed graph is structured by arcs that 
include the associative direction. The numbers of 
incoming and outgoing arcs from a node are re-
ferred to as the in-degree and out-degree of a node, 
respectively. The sum of the in-degree and out-
degree values of a node is equal to its total degree. 
This concept of graph analysis allows us to 
categorize the total words in the data into three 
types; one being words only found in the stimulus 
set (S-type), one being words occurred as both 
stimulus and responses (SR-type), and the last be-
ing words only observed among the response set 
(R-type). The proportion of S-type, SR-type, and 
R-type words in the total word set corresponds to 
12.2% (1,568 words), 18.5% (2,374 words), and 
69.3% (8,901 words) respectively. Here, it is worth 
focusing on the SR-type of words. These are words 
selected as the most frequent ones through a large-
scale corpus covering various fields. At the same 
time, they also are produced by people in the free 
association task. This may indicate, in some sense, 
the high usability or commonness of those words. 
Indeed, the most frequent words in this data all 
belong to the SR-type. 
2.4 Network Analysis (2) 
Scale-free: The most frequent words belonging to 
the SR-type play the role of hubs in semantic net-
works made from word association data. These 
hubs can be represented as nodes that have not 
only outgoing links but also possess ingoing links, 
which leads us think of a scale-free graph, such as 
that incorporated within the Barab?si-Albert (BA) 
model. It is widely known that Barab?si and Albert 
(1999) have suggested that the degree distributions 
of scale-free network structures correspond to a 
power law, expressed as rddxP  !! )(  (where d 
stands for degree and ?is a small integer, such as 
2 or 3). This type of distribution is also known as 
Zipf's law, which describes the typical frequency 
distributions of words in a document and plots on a 
log scale as a falling diagonal stroke. The degree 
distribution of nodes in the KorWA network also 
exhibits this scale-free property, which has also 
been observed in word association data for differ-
ent languages. 
 
 
Figure 3. Degree distribution on log-log scales for the 
KorWA semantic network. P(k) is the probability that a 
node has k degrees in the network. 
   
However, we should stress the importance of 
network dynamics and of microscopically examin-
ing the ongoing process of data accumulation to 
determine whether the scale-freeness observed for 
word association data is derived from the same 
mechanism as the BA model. Rather than being 
static, networks are recognized as evolving over 
time, with the adding or pruning of nodes and 
edges (Barab?si and Albert, 1999; Watts, 1999). 
Indeed, we can easily identify such networks in a 
number of areas, from the World Wide Web to the 
internet connections on a physical level, co-
authorships, friendships, and business transactions. 
31
According to the BA model, the probability that 
a node receives an additional link is proportional to 
its degree. The probability that a new vertex will 
be connected to a vertex (node) i  depends on the 
connectivity of that vertex. Barab?si and Albert 
(1999) explain with this idea of preferential at-
tachment in terms of the scale-free property and 
the presence of hubs within the network. Networks 
as dynamical systems which grow over time and 
have topological properties produce dynamical 
behaviors as well. In particular with research on 
the diffusion of a new trend or technology or the 
spread of a disease and virus, the structural proper-
ties of the network have presented a new approach 
to understanding epidemical behaviors over a net-
work, including issues about why contagion occurs 
in certain cases, how it spreads, and what is the 
most efficient and effective way to prevent it. 
Many researchers have tried to address and analyze 
such behaviors with small-world models (Ball et 
al., 1997; Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and scale-free 
models (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001). 
The semantic networks that we have examined 
to date have similar structural properties to many 
other networks. So, it is also possible to explain the 
scale-free feature of semantic networks in terms of 
preferential attachment? How can such dynamic 
behavior be interpreted for semantic networks? In 
the next section, we would like to briefly discuss 
those questions a little further. 
2.5 Network Analysis (3) 
Network Dynamics: It is a matter of fact that lan-
guage evolves; especially from a lexical perspec-
tive, where new vocabularies are generated and old 
senses sometimes disappear over time. However, 
tracing and observing such changes is rather diffi-
cult because such natural language evolution oc-
curs over long periods of time. When considering 
the evolution of semantic networks, therefore, we 
assume that the growth of a semantic network may 
correspond to the increases in the numbers of 
words (nodes) and semantic relations (edges) in as 
more data is added in the construction of the net-
work. Particularly, for our semantic networks 
which are built from word association data, the 
networks grow as more word association data is 
added. 
In this sense, we can attempt to observe the 
growth process for semantic networks here. To that 
aim, the KorWA network is particularly suitable, 
as it is constructed from KorWA data collected 
from two sessions that used exactly the same task. 
We may see how the network evolves by taking 
the sessions as two separate points in time. 
From the beginning, the KorWA network starts 
with the 3,951 nodes that correspond to the set of 
stimulus words. It cannot be called a network at 
this stage because there are no links between these 
nodes. Then, as the word associations are collected, 
a network starts to appear by adding edges between 
the initial nodes and new nodes corresponding to 
the association responses. When the first session of 
data collection was complete, we found that the 
initially disconnected 3,951 nodes forming a large, 
well-connected network, as presented in Table 1. 
 
Table 1. Growth of the KorWA semantic network. 
 
 
The number of nodes had increased to 9,054, 
and 13,669 edges were generated between them. 
8,641 nodes corresponding to 95% of the total 
nodes are connected to each other, being the larg-
est component in the network, but, at the same 
time, there were also 126 small partitions with 2 to 
3 nodes connected to each. The pseudo diameter, 
the longest distance, of the largest component is 18, 
which indicates that the nodes within it are well 
connected to each other. In this network, a node 
has three links on average and the distribution of 
degrees in the network shows a power law distribu-
tion (P(k)~K-  with a degree exponent !=2.42), as 
in Figure 3 above. 
Then, additional word associations were col-
lected for the same set of stimulus words in the 
same manner as in the first session. When the new 
data was added to the first network, we obtained a 
larger network, as described in Table 1. The net-
work grew by 12,844 nodes and 26,931 edges. 
Through this process, more than 99.7% of nodes 
(12,807) became interconnected, leaving on 37 
words as elements disconnected from the whole 
graph. Moreover, the pseudo diameter of the larg-
32
est component became smaller despite the increase 
in its size. The discrepancy in the degrees of words 
became larger than before, with a degree range 
from 1 to 198.

Note. The number after the slash indicates the degree for

Over time (as reflected in the first and second 
sessions of data collection), 3,790 nodes and 
13,262 edges newly appeared in the KorWA net-
work. Through this growth, the network became 
much more interconnected, as clearly evidenced by 
the size of the largest component and the pseudo 
diameter. What is particularly salient is the number 
of links that a word has through the growth process. 
Interestingly, regardless of the double increase in 
the connections within the network, around 60% of 
the total nodes were still poorly connected, having 
a degree of only 1 or 2. On the other hand, some of 
nodes that already had plenty of links became 
much richer, becoming linked to even more other 
nodes; with the average degree for 1% of the total 
nodes being over 60. Table 2 lists the top 20 words 
in terms of highest degree values before and after 
growth. The first four words do not change in order, 
while the shifts for the other top items are not so 
significant. However, for most of these items, the 
degree value roughly doubled. 
From these observations, we can assume that 
there are some words that attract more links from 
other nodes, while most of these other words have 
just a few connections. This phenomenon appears 
even more conspicuously through the growth proc-
ess. The scale-free nature of semantic networks 
also seems to reflect a kind of preferential attach-
ment. What kinds of words always attract links 
from new nodes? As suggested already, these seem 
to be basic concept words, closely related to daily 
life and culture, and these hubs form a kind of 
bridge between several different conceptual do-
mains. 
Such words contributing to the connectivity of 
the network are central to the dynamic behavior of 
across the networks, and are likely to be key con-
cept words for understanding a culture and for 
learning language within the contexts of semantic 
networks. Further study and exploration in the

3 Conclusion and Further study 
This paper has described our dataset to represent 
human language in the form of a network. With 
much interest in language as a communication and 
thinking tool, we have sought to build a semantic 
network representing lexical knowledge and the 
conceptual relations between words. To that aim, 
word association data is particularly suitable in 
terms of its data format and its abundant and useful 
content. We presented a project to collect Korean 
word association norms given the high utility and 
urgent need of data of this kind. We have detailed 
the project from the design of free association ex-
periment to the basic analysis of the data collected. 
The application of the word association data to 
computational neurolinguistics is an issue for our 
future work. We believe that our study could po-
tentially represent a breakthrough for this research 
field. The methods of Mitchell et al (2008), for 
example, suggest to us strong connections between 
neural activation data and lexical co-occurrence 
information, obtained from text corpora which 
plays a role of intermediating within linguistics 
33
embodiment theory with a sensory-motor basis and 
amodal theory with computational models. Ac-
cording to Mitchell et al, the techniques of natural 
language processing combined with neural linguis-
tics can enable us to predict the patterns of neural 
activation for word stimuli for which fMRI data 
are not yet available. In short, the neural associa-
tions within firing patterns turn out to be correlated 
with word associations within co-occurrence pat-
terns. 
However, the similarity coefficient or the dis-
tance between any two words might be computed 
not only from a set of documents but also from 
graphic representations of associative concepts, 
such as the one presented in this paper. If it is true 
that a word can be represented not only by a three-
dimensional array of cerebral activation, but also in 
terms of the lexical relatedness that is incorporated 
as a linear combination of these patterns, it may 
not be an overstatement to say that there might be a 
structural homology between natural neural net-
works in the brain and semantic networks built 
from word association norms. This kind of meta-
network perspective within cognitive science has 
become all the more important because attempts to 
fill the gaps in the modeling of neural pathways are 
increasingly attracting wide interest. Sporns et al 
(2004), for instance, have tried to apply the con-
ceptual methods of complex networks, such as 
small word-scale free, to cortical networks and to 
the more dynamic, functional and effective con-
nectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. 
Similarly, Stam and Reijneveld (2007) have intro-
duced a graph analysis applied to multi-channel 
recordings of brain activity, by setting up vertices 
at the anatomical loci within a neural circuit and 
linking some that elicit high correlation patterns to 
the same stimulus. Also within the experiment 
paradigms used by Mitchell et al some techniques 
for constructing a network model could be effec-
tive for the distributional representation of cortical 
responses handled at the same level as meaning 
proximity, even though Mitchell et al treated each 
voxel (volumetric pixel value in a 3-dimensional 
regular grid) independently. If such models of net-
work settings could be applied to images of neural 
activation across all the voxels for a set of stimulus 
nouns, it is possible to assume, by a reverse proc-
ess of parameter estimation, the existence of hid-
den semantic layers composed of unknown 
semantic features. These intermediate factors could 
be compared with real vocabulary data, such as 
basic verbs (as in the experiment conducted by 
Mitchell et al) taking the stimulus nouns as sub-
jects or targets. 
Moreover, the merits of introducing graph 
analysis techniques to computational neurolinguis-
tics could possibly be found in the evolutionary 
dynamics of networks, to the extent that the degree 
of word nodes (or, more simply, their frequencies) 
could be weighted for the neural connectivity de-
duced from fMRI responses. The data formats of 
neural activation patterns could then assimilate 
diachronic data to represent how a network grows 
over time around the key concepts or hub words, in 
accordance with the learning processes of particu-
lar individuals. Future research from this perspec-
tive could also support the high accuracy of similar 
experiments regardless of distributional bias in 
word frequencies. Briefly, semantic networks con-
structed from word association data could convey 
the lexical co-occurrence of words within docu-
ments to a visual map of the human brain reacting 
to those words.
