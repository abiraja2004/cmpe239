Abstract
In this paper we explore the applicability of
existing coreference resolution systems to a
biomedical genre: radiology reports. Analysis
revealed that, due to the idiosyncrasies of the
domain, both the formulation of the problem
of coreference resolution and its solution need
significant domain adaptation work. We refor-
mulated the task and developed an unsuper-
vised algorithm based on heuristics for coref-
erence resolution in radiology reports. The
algorithm is shown to perform well on a test
dataset of 150 manually annotated radiology
reports.
1 Introduction
Coreference resolution is the process of determin-
ing whether two expressions in natural language re-
fer to the same entity in the world. General purpose
coreference resolution systems typically cluster all
mentions (usually noun phrases) in a document into
coreference chains according to the underlying ref-
erence entity. A number of coreference resolution
algorithms have been developed for general texts. To
name a few, Soon et al (2001) employed machine
learning on the task and achieved an F-score of 62.6
and 60.4 on the MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1997)
coreference corpora respectively. Ng et al (2002)
improved this learning framework and achieved F-
scores of 70.4 and 63.4 respectively on the same
datasets.
There are also a number of freely available off-
the-shelf coreference resolution modules developed
for the general domain. For example, BART (Vers-
ley et al, 2008) is an open source coreference reso-
lution system which provides an implementation of
the Soon et al algorithm (2001). The Stanford De-
terministic Coreference Resolution System (Raghu-
nathan et al, 2010) uses an unsupervised sieve-like
approach to coreference resolution. Similarly, the
GATE Information Extraction system (Cunningham
et al, 2002) includes a rule-based coreference reso-
lution module consisting of orthography-based pat-
terns and a pronominal coreferencer (matching pro-
nouns to the most recent referent).
While coreference resolution is a universal dis-
course problem, both the scope of the problem and
its solution could vary significantly across domains
and text genres. Newswire coreference resolution
corpora (such as the MUC corpus) and general pur-
pose tools do not always fit the needs of specific do-
mains such as the biomedical domain well.
The importance and distinctive characteristics of
coreference resolution for biomedical articles has
been recognized, for example (Castano et al, 2002;
Gasperin, 2006; Gasperin et al, 2007; Su et al,
2008). Within the biomedical field, clinical texts
have been noted as a genre that needs specialized
coreference corpora and methodologies (Zheng et
al., 2011). The importance of the task for the clini-
cal domain has been attested by the 2011 i2b2 NLP
shared task (Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside1) which provided an evaluation plat-
form for coreference resolution for clinical texts.
However, even within the clinical domain, coref-
erence in different sub-genres could vary signifi-

cantly. In this paper we demonstrate the idiosyn-
crasies of the task of coreference resolution in a
clinical domain sub-genre, radiology reports, and
describe an unsupervised system developed for the
task.
2 Coreference Resolution for Radiology
Reports
Radiology reports have some unique characteristics
that preclude the use of coreference resolution mod-
ules or algorithms developed for the general biomed-
ical domain or even for other types of clinical texts.
The radiology report is a clinical text used to com-
municate medical image findings and observations
to referring physicians. Typically, radiology reports
are produced by radiologists after examining medi-
cal images and are used to describe the findings and
observations present in the accompanied images.
The radiology report accompanies an imaging
study and frequently refers to artifacts present in
the image. In radiology reports, artifacts present
in the image exhibit discourse salience, and as a
result are often introduced with definite pronouns
and articles. For example, consider the sentence
The pericardial space is clear. The definite noun
phrase the pericardial space does not represent an
anaphoric (or cataphoric) discourse entity and has
no antecedent. In contrast, coreference resolution
in general texts typically considers definite noun
phrases to be anaphoric discourse entities and at-
tempts to find their antecedents.
Another important distinction between general
purpose coreference resolution and the coreference
resolution module needed by an NLP system for
clinical texts is the scope of the task. General pur-
pose coreference resolution systems typically cluster
all mentions in a document into coreference chains.
Such comprehensive mention clustering is often not
necessary for the purposes of clinical text NLP sys-
tems. Biomedical Information Extraction systems
typically first identify named entities (medical con-
cepts) and map them to unambiguous biomedical
standard vocabularies (e.g. UMLS2 or RadLex3 in
the radiological domain). While multiple mentions
of the same named entity could exist in a document,
2http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/
3http://www.radlex.org/
in most cases these mentions were previously as-
signed to the same medical concept. For example,
multiple report mentions of ?the heart? or ?the lung?
will normally be mapped to the same medical con-
cept and clustering of these mentions into corefer-
ence chains is typically not needed.
3 Task Definition
Analysis revealed that the coreference resolution
task could be simplified and still meet the needs of
most Information Extraction tasks relevant to the ra-
diological domain. Due to their nature, texts de-
scribing medical image finding and observations do
not contain most pronominal references typically
targeted by coreference resolution systems. For ex-
ample, no occurrence of personal pronouns (e.g. he,
I), possessive pronouns (e.g. his, my), and indefi-
nite pronouns (e.g. anyone, nobody) was found in
the validation dataset. Demonstrative pronouns and
non-pleonastic ?it? mentions were the only pronom-
inal references observed in the dataset4. The fol-
lowing examples demonstrate the use of demonstra-
tive pronouns and the non-pleonastic ?it? pronoun
(shown in bold):
There is prominent soft tissue swelling involving
the premaxillary tissues. This measures approxi-
mately 15 mm in thickness and extends to the infe-
rior aspect of the nose.
There is a foreign object in the proximal left main-
stem bronchus on series 11 image 17 that was not
present on the prior study. It has a somewhat ovoid
to linear configuration.
Following these observations, the coreference res-
olution task has been simplified as follows. Corefer-
ence chains are assigned only for demonstrative pro-
nouns and ?it? noun phrases. The coreference reso-
lution task then involves selecting for each mention
a single best antecedent among previously annotated
named entities (medical concepts) or the NULL an-
tecedent.
4 Dataset
A total of 300 radiology reports were set aside for
validation and testing purposes. The dataset consists

It is raining, while non-pleonastic use of the pronoun refers to
a specific entity.

Ultrasound Breast reports, and 100 Magnetic Res-
onance Brain reports, all randomly selected based
on their report types from a dataset of more than
100,000 de-identified reports spanning a period of
9 years5. These three types of reports represent
a diverse dataset covering representative imaging
modalities and body regions. Figure 1 shows a sam-
ple Breast Ultrasound DICOM6 image and its asso-
ciated radiology report.
The reports were previously tagged (using an au-
tomated system) with medical concepts and their
semantic types (e.g. anatomical entity, disorder,
imaging observation, etc.). Half of the dataset (150
reports) was manually annotated with coreference
chains using the simplified task definition described
above. The other half of the dataset was used for
validation of the system described next.
5 Method and Results
The coreference resolution task involves selecting
for each mention a single best antecedent among
previously annotated named entities or the NULL
antecedent. Mentions are demonstrative pronoun
phrases or definite noun phrases containing previ-
ously annotated named entities.

We implemented an algorithm for the task de-
scribed above which was inspired by the work of
Haghighi and Klein (2009). The algorithm first iden-
tifies mentions within each report and orders them
linearly according to the position of the mention
head. Then it selects the antecedent (or the NULL
antecedent) for each mention as follows:
1. The possible antecedent candidates are first fil-
tered based on a distance constraint. Only mentions
of interest belonging to the preceding two sentences
are considered. The rationale for this filtering step is
that radiology reports are typically very concise and
less cohesive than general texts. Paragraphs often
describe multiple observations and anatomical enti-
ties sequentially and rarely refer to mentions more
distant than the preceding two sentences.
2. The remaining antecedent candidates are then
filtered based on a syntactic constraint: the co-
referent mentions must agree in number (singular or
plural based on the noun phrase head).
3. The remaining antecedent candidates are then
filtered based on a semantic constraint. If the two
mentions refer to named entities, the named entities
need to have the same semantic category7.
4. After filtering, the closest mention from the set
of remaining possible antecedents is selected. If the
set is empty, the NULL antecedent is selected.
Pairwise coreference decisions are considered
transitive and antecedent matches are propagated
transitively to all paired co-referents.
The algorithm was evaluated on the manually an-
notated test dataset. Results (Table 1) were com-
puted using the pairwise F1-score measure: preci-
sion, recall, and F1-score were computed over all
pairs of mentions in the same coreference cluster.

between 39.8 and 67.3 for various methods and
test sets (Haghighi and Klein, 2009). The simpli-
fication of the coreference resolution problem de-
scribed above allowed us to focus only on corefer-
ence chains of interest to clinical text Information
Extraction tasks and positively influenced the out-
come. In addition, our goal was to focus on high
precision results as opposed to optimizing the over-
all F1-score. This guarantees that coreference reso-
lution errors will result in mostly omissions of coref-
erence pairs and will not introduce information ex-
traction inaccuracies.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented some of the challenges
involved in the task of adapting coreference resolu-
tion for the domain of clinical radiology. We pre-
sented a domain-specific definition of the corefer-
ence resolution task. The task was reformulated and
simplified in a practical manner that ensures that the
needs of biomedical information extraction systems
are still met. We developed an unsupervised ap-
proach to the task of coreference resolution of radi-
ology reports and demonstrate state-of-the-art preci-
sion and reasonable recall results. The developed
system is made publicly available to the NLP re-
search community.
