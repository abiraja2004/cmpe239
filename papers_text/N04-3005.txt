Abstract 
This paper describes a fully-automated real-
time broadcast news video and audio process-
ing system.  The system combines speech rec-
ognition, machine translation, and cross-
lingual information retrieval components to 
enable real-time alerting from live English 
and Arabic news sources.

Real-time Video Alerting 
This paper describes the Enhanced Video Text and Au-
dio Processing (eViTAP) system, which provides fully-
automated real-time broadcast news video and audio 
processing.   The system combines state-of-the-art 
automatic speech recognition and machine translation 
components with cross-lingual information retrieval in 
order to enable searching of multilingual video news 
sources by a monolingual speaker.   In addition to full 
search capabilities, the system also enables real-time 
alerting, such that a user can be notified as soon as a 
word, phrase, or topic of interest appears in an English 
or Arabic news broadcast. 
The key component of the news processing is the 
Virage VideoLogger video indexer software package 
(Virage 2003).  The VideoLogger processes an incom-
ing live satellite feed, encodes the video as a digital file, 
and manages the video and audio processing compo-
nents.  The individual components integrated into the 
VideoLogger platform currently include the audio proc-
essing and machine translation systems described in 
Section 2, as well as face ID, broadcaster logo ID, and 
scene change analysis. 
The video and audio processing components pro-
duce textual metadata that is time-stamped to enable 
synchronization with the encoded video file.  All data is 
indexed and stored for retrieval by a cross-lingual in-
formation retrieval engine.  Figure 1 shows the EViTAP 
cross-lingual search and alerting interface, with real data 
from the system.   The list of relevant video clips match-
ing an alerting profile or a user search is shown on the 
left, with broadcast source and time, most-frequent 
named entities, and a relevancy score.  Note that the 
English query ?bin laden? resulted in the display of 
relevant stories in both English and Arabic.   The center 
of the screen contains the video playback window, with 
clip navigation and keyframe storyboard.  The right of 
the interface contains the transcripts from the ASR and 
MT engines; video playback is synchronized with the 
transcripts such that words are highlighted as they are 
spoken in the video.   
Real-time Spoken Language Processing 
The real-time audio processing in the eViTAP system is 
performed by the BBN AudioIndexer system, described 
in detail in (Makhoul et al 2000). The AudioIndexer 
system provides a wide range of real-time audio proc-
essing components, including automatic speech recogni-
tion, speaker segmentation and identification, topic 
classification, and named entity detection.   All audio 
processing is carried out on a high-end PC (dual 2.6 
GHz Xeon CPU, 2 GB RAM).   The real-time speech 
recognition system produces a word error rate of 
roughly 20-30% for English and Arabic news sources.

The Arabic words produced by the speech 
recognition system, including all ASR errors,  are 
processed by an Arabic-to-English machine translation 
system that also operates in real time (on a separate 
high-end PC).  The eViTAP system currently processes 
Arabic sources using statistical machine translation 
systems from IBM (Al-Onaizan 2003) and Language 
Weaver (Benjamin et al 2003).
