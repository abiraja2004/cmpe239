Abstract 
We present a statistical word feature, the Word Relation Matrix, which can be used to 
find translated pairs of words and terms from non-parallel corpora, across language groups. 
Online dictionary entries are used as seed words to generate Word Relation Matrices for 
the unknown words according to correlation measures. Word Relation Matrices are then 
mapped across the corpora to find translation pairs. Translation accuracies are around 30% 
when only the top candidate is counted. Nevertheless, top 20 candidate output give a 50.9% 
average increase in accuracy on human translator performance. 
1 Introduction 
Despite a surge in research using parallel corpora for various machine translation tasks 
(Brown et al 1993),(Brown et al 1991; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Dagan & Church 
1994; Simard et al 1992; Chen 1993; Melamed 1995; Wu & Xia 1994; Wu 1994; Smadja 
et aI. 1996), the amount of available bilingual parallel corpora is still relatively small in 
comparison to the large amount of available monolingual text. It ks unlikely that one can 
find parallel corpora in any given domain in electronic form. This is a particularly acute 
problem in language pairs such as Chinese/English or Japanese/English where there are 
fewer translated texts than in European language pairs. While we should make use of any 
existing parallel corpora s lexical translation resources, we should not ignore the even larger 
192 ! 
amount of monolingual text. However, using non-parallel corpora for lexical translation has 
been a daunting task, considered much more difficult than that with parallel corpora. 
In this paper, we present an initial algorithm for translating technical terms using a pair 
of non-parallel corpora. Evaluation results show translation precisions at around 30% when 
only the top candidate is considered. While this precision is lower than that achieved with 
parallel corpora, we show that top 20 candidate output from our algorithm allows translators 
to increase their accuracy by 50.9%. In the following sections, we first describe a pair of 
non-parallel corpora we use for experiments, and then we introduce the Word Relation 
Matrix (WORM), a statistical word feature representation for technical term translation 
from non-parallel corpora. We evaluate the effectiveness of this feature with two sets of 
experiments, using English/English, and English/Japanese non-parallel corpora. 
2 Related work 
Few attempts have been made to explore non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts in the 
same domain. Early work uses a pair of non-parallel texts for the task of lexical disam- 
biguation between several senses of a word (Dagan 1990). 
This basic idea extends to choosing a translation among multiple candidates (Dagan 
& Itai 1994) given collocation information. A similar idea is later applied by (Rapp 1995) 
to show the plausibility of correlations between words in non-parallel text. He proposed a 
matrix permutation method matching co-occurrence patterns in two non-parallel texts, but 
noted that computational limitations hamper further extension of this method. Using the 
same idea, (Tanaka ~ Iwasaki 1996) demonstrated how to eliminate candidate words in a 
bilingual dictionary. 
All the above works point to a certain discriminatory feature in monolingual texts 
context and word relations. However, these works remain in the realm of solving ambiguities 
or choosing the best candidate among a small set of possibilities. It is argued in (Gale 
8z Church 1994) that feature vectors of 100,000 dimensions are likely to be needed for 
high resolution discriminant analysis. It is so far questionable whether feature vectors of 
lower dimensions are discriminating enough for extracting bilingual lex/cal pairs from non- 
parallel corpora with a large number of candidates. Is it possible to achieve bilingual lex/con 
translation by looking at words in relation to other words? In this paper, we hope to shed 
some light on this question. 
I 3 Two pilot non-parallel corpora 
In our experiments, we use two sets of non-parallel corpora: (1) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) 
from 1993 and 1994, divided into two non-overlapping parts. Each resulting English corpus 
has 10.36M bytes of data. (2) Wall Street Journal in English and Nikkei Financial News in 
Japanese, from the same time period. The WSJ  text contains 49M bytes of data, and the 
Nikkei 127M bytes. Since the Nikkei is encoded in two-byte Japanese character sets, the 
latter is equivalent to about 60M bytes of data in English. 
The English Wall Street Journal non-parallel corpus gives us an easier test set on which 
to start. The output of this corpus should consist of words matching to themselves as trans- 
193 
lations. It is useful as a baseline valuation test set providing an estimate on performance. 
The WSJ/Nikkei corpus is the most non-parallel type of corpus. In addition to being 
written in languages across linguistic families by different journalists, WSJ/Nikkei also 
share only a limited amount of common topic. The Wall Street Journal tends to focus 
on U.S. domestic economic and political news, whereas the Nikkei Financial News focuses 
on economic and political events in Japan and in Asia. Due to the large difference in 
content, language, writing style, we consider this corpus more difficult han others. However, 
the result we obtain from this corpus gives us a lower-bound on the performance of our 
algorithm.

4 An algorithm for finding terminology translations from 
non-parallel corpora 
Bilingual lexicon translation algorithms for parallel corpora in general make use of fixed 
correlations between a pair of bilingual terms, reflected in their frequent co-occurrences in 
translated texts, to find lexicon translations. We use correlations both between monolingual 
lexical units, and between bilingual or multilingual lexical units, to find a consistent pattern 
which is represented as statistical word features for translation. 
We illustrate the possible correlations using the word debentures in the two different 
parts of WSJ. Figure 1 shows segments from both texts containing the word deMntures. 
Figure 1: Part of the concordances of the word debenture in WSJ1 and WSJ2

Commission to issue as much as $125 million of 30-year debentures packaged with common stock

Figure I shows that: 
194 
1. debentures co-occurs  most frequently with words such as million and due in both texts. 
2. debentures i less related to engineering, which does not appear in any segments containing 
debentures. 
3. Given all words in one text, debentures i  closely correlated with a subset of all words in the 
texts. In Figure 1, this subset consists of million, due, convertible, subordinated, etc. 
Following the above observations, we propose the following algorithm for finding word or term 
translation pairs from non-parallel corpora: 
1. Given a bilingual ist of known translation pairs (i.e. seed words) 
2. For every unknown word or term e in language 1, find its eorrelationl with every word in the 
seed word list in language 1 ~ relation vector WORM1 
3. Similarly for unknown words c in language 2, find its correlationl with every word in the seed 
word list in language 2 ~ relation vector Wo.RM2 
4. Compete correlation2(WoRM1, WORM2); if it is high, e and c are considered as a translation 
pair. 
We use online dictionaries to provide the it seed word lists. To avoid problems of polysemy 
and nonstandardization in dictionary entries, we choose a more reliable, less ambiguous subset of 
dictionary entries as the seed word list. This subset contains dictionary entries which occur at mid- 
range frequency in the corpus so that they are more likely to be content words. They must occur in 
both sides of the non-parallel corpora, and have fewer number of candidate translations. Such seed 
words serve as the textual anchor points in non-parallel corpora. For example, we obtained 1,416 
entries from the Japanese/English online dictionary EDICT using these criteria. 
5 A word in relat ion to seed words 
Word correlations are important statistical information which has been successfully employed to find 
bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora. Word correlations W(w~, wt) are computed from general 
likelihood scores based on the co-occurrence of words in common segments. Segments are either 
sentences, paragraphs, or string groups delimited by anchor paints: 
a+b Pr(w~ ---- 1) = a+b?c+d 
a?e 
Pr(wt = 1) = a+b?c?d 
a 
Pr(ws=l ,  wt=l )  = a+b+c+d 
where a = number of segments where both words occur 
b = number of segments where only ws occur 
c = number of segments where only wt occur 
d = number of segments where neither words occur 
All correlation measures use the above likelihood scores in different formulations. In our Word 
Relation Matrix (WORM) representation, we use the correlation measure W(ws, wt) between a seed 
word ws and an unknown Word tot. a, b, c and d are computed from the segments in the monolingual 
text of the non-parallel corpus. 
195 
W(w=, w,) is the weighted mutual information in our algorithm since it is most suitable for 
lexicon compilation of mid-frequency technical words or terms: 
Pr(w= = 1, w, = 1) 
= 1, = I) log2 2- ---'1) 
Given n seed words (1/1si, Ws2, . . .  , t/),n), we thus obtain a Word Relation Matrix for w=: 
(W(w=, w,1), W(w , w,2), . . . , W(w=, wo,,) ) 
As an initial step, all Pr(w, = 1) are pre-computed for the seed words in both languages. We 
have experimented with various segment sizes, ranging from phrases delimited by all punctuations, 
a sentence, to an entire paragraph. 
From our experiment results, we conclude that the right segment size is a function of the fre- 
quency of the seed words: 
1 
segment size cc 
frequency(Ws) 
If the seed words are frequent, and if the segment size is as large as a paragraph size, then these 
frequent seed words could occur in every single segment. In this case, the chances for co-occurrence 
between such seed words and all new words are very high, close to one. With large segments, such 
seed words are too biasing and thus, smaller segment size must be used. Conversely, we need a 
larger segment size ff seed word frequency is low. 
Consequently, we use the paragraph as the segment size for our experiment on Wall Street 
Journal/Nikkei Corpus since all the seed words are mid-frequency content words. We computed all 
binary vectors of the 1,416 seed words Ws where the/-th dimension of the vector is 1 ff the seed 
word occurs in the/-th paragraph in the text, zero otherwise. 
We use a smaller segment size - between any two punctuations - for the segment size for the 
Wall Street Journal English/English corpus since many of the seed words are frequent. 
Next, Pr(w= = i) is computed for all unknown words z in both texts. The WoRM vectors are 
then sorted according to W(w=, w~i). The most correlated seed word w~/will have the top scoring 
As an example, using 307 seed word pairs in the WSJ /WSJ  corpus, we obtain the following 
most correlated seed words with debentures in two different years of Wall Street Journal as shown 
in Figure 2. In both texts, the same set of words correlate with debenture closely. 
WoRM plots of debentures and administration are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. The 
horizontal axis has 307 points representing the seed words, the vertical axis has the value of the 
correlation scores between these 307 seed words and our example words. These figures show that 
WoRMs of the same words are similar to each other, but WoRMs are different between different 
words. 
6 Match ing  Word  Relat ion Mat r i ces  
When all vnknown words are represented in WoRMs,  a matching function is needed to find the 
best WoRM pairs as bilingual lexicon entries. There are many metrics we can use to measure the 
closeness of two WoRMs.  
When matching vectors are very similar such as those in the WSJ  English/English corpus, a 
simple metric like the Euclidean Distance could be used to find those matching pairs:

However, most word pairs in truly non-parallel bilingual corpus are less similar than those in 
Figure 3. The 9 value of a new word is high when there is a z-th seed word which co-occurs with 
it siguificantly often. If a pair of bilingual words are supposed to be translations of each other, 
they should share the most significant y values. In this case, the Cosine Measure would be more 
appropriate where: 
C = Et<i<~(w,. - wt,) 
The Cosine Measure will give the highest value to vector pairs which share the most non-zero y
values. Therefore, it favors word pairs which share the most number of closely related seed words. 
However, the Cosine Measure is also directly proportional to another parameter, namely the actual 
(ws. ? wt.) values. Consequently, if ws has a high y value everywhere, then the Cosine Measure 
between any wt and this ws would be high. This violates our assumptions in that although w8 
and wt might not correlate closely with the same set of seed words, the matching score would be 
nevertheless high. This is another supporting reason for choosing mid-frequency ontent words as 
seed words.

7 Evaluation 1: Matching English words to English 
The evaluation on the WSJ/WSJ English/English corpus is intended as a pilot test on the dis- 
criminative power of the Word Relation Matrix. This non-parallel corpus has minimal content and 
style differences. Furthermore, using such an English/English test set, the output can be evaluated 
automatically--a translated pair is considered correct if they are identical English words. 
307 seed words are chosen according to their occurrence frequency (400-3900) to minimize the 
number of function words. However, a frequency of 3900 in a corpus of 1.SM words is quite high. As 
a result, a segment delimited by two punctuations is used as the context window size. Furthermore, 
the frequent nature of the seed words led to our choice of the Euclidean Distance, instead of the 
Cosine Measure. The choices of segment size, seed words, and Euclidean Distance measure are all 
direct consequences of the atypical nature of the English/English pilot test set. 
We selected a test set of 582 (set A) by 687 (set B) single words with mid-range frequency from 
the WSJ texts. We computed the WoRM feature for each of these test words and computed the 
Euclidean Distance between every word in these sets. We then calculated the accuracy by counting 
the number of words whose top one candidate is identical to itself, obtaining a precision of 29%. 
By allowing N-top candidates, the accuracy improves as shown in the graphs for 582 words 
output in Figure 5 (i.e. a translation is correct if it appears among the first N candidates). If we 
find the correct translation among the top 100 candidates, we obtain a precision of around 58%. 
N-top candidates are useful as translator aids. 
Meanwhile, precisions for translating less polysemous content words are higher. If only the 445 
content words (manually selected) are kept from the 582-word set, the precisions at different op N 
candidates for the 445-word set are higher as shown in Figure 5 by the dotted line. We believe the 
accuracy would be even higher if we only look at really unambiguous test words, such as an entire 
technical term. It is well known that polysemous words usually have only one sense when used as 
part of a collocation or technical term (Yarowsky 1993). 
8 Evaluation 2: Matching Japanese terms to English 
m Evaluations are also carried out on the Wall Street Journal and Nikkei Financial News corpus, 
matching technical terms in Japanese to their counterpart in English. This evaluation is a difficult 
test case because (1) the two languages, English and Japanese, are across language groups; (2) the i

two texts, Wall Street Journal and Nikkei Financial News, do not focus on the same topics; and (3) 
the two texts are not written by the same authors. 
1,416 entries from the Japanese/English online dictionary EDICT  with occurrence frequencies 
between 100 and 1000 are chosen as seed words. Since these seed words have relatively low frequencies 
compared to the corpus size of around 7 million words for the WSJ  text, we chose the segment size 
to be that of an entire paragraph. For the same reason, the Cosine Measure is chosen as a matching 
function. 
For evaluation, we need to select a test set of known technical term translations. We hand- 
translated a selected set of technical terms from the Nikkei Financial News corpus and looked 
them up in the Wall Street Journal text. Among these, 19 terms, shown in Figure 6, have their 
counterparts in the WSJ  text. 
Three evaluations were carried out. In all cases, a translation is counted as correct if the top 
candidate is the rig~ht one. Test I tries to find the correct translation for each of the nineteen Japanese 
terms among the nineteen Engl/sh terms. To increase the candidate numbers, test II is carried out 
on 19 Japanese terms with their English counterparts plus 293 other English terms, giving a total 
of 312 possible English candidates. The third test set HI consists of the nineteen Japanese terms 
paired with their translations and 383 single English words in addition. The accuracies for the three 
test sets are shown in Figure 7; precision ranges from 21.1% to 52.6%. 
Figure 8 shows the ranking of the true translations among all the candidates for all 19 cases for 
the purpose of a translator-aid. Most of the correct translations can be found among the top 20 
cand/dates. 
8.1 Trans lator -a id  results 
The previous two evaluations show that the precision of best-candidate translation using our algo- 
rithm is around 30% on average. While it is far from ideal, this is the first result of terminology 
translation from non-parallel corpora. Meanwhile, we have found that the correct translation is 
often among the top 20 candidates. This leads us to conjecture that the output from this algorithm 
can be used as a translator-aid.

Figure 7: Precisions for the best candidate translation in the WSJ /Nikkei  corpus 
To evaluate this, we again chose the nineteen English/Japanese terms from the WSJ/Nikkei 
non-parallel corpus as a test set. We chose three evaluators who are all native Chinese speakers 
with bilingual knowledge in English and Chinese. Chinese speakers are able to recognize most 
Japanese technical terms since they are very similar to Chinese. We asked them to translate these 
nineteen Japanese terms into English without using dictionaries or other reference material. The 
translators have some general knowledge of international news. However, none of them specializes 
in economics or finance, which is the domain of the WSJ/Nikkei corpus. Their output is in SET  
A. Our system then proposes two sets of outputs: (1) for each Japanese term, our system proposes 
the top-20 candidates from the set of 312 noun phrases. Using this candidate list, the translators 
again translate the nineteen terms. Their output based on this information is in SET.B; (2) for each 
Japanese term, our system proposes the top-20 candidates from the set containing 383 single words 
plus the nineteen terms. The result of human translation based on this candidate list is in SET  C. 
Sets A, B and C are all compared to the original translation in the corpus. If the translation is the 
same as in the corpus, then it is judged as correct. The results are shown in Figure 9. Evaluators on 
average are able to translate 8 terms out of 19 by themselves, whereas they can translate 18 terms 
on average with the aid of our output. Translation precision increases on the average by 50.9%. 
9 Conclusion 
We have described a statistical word signature feature, the Word Relation Matrix, that can be used 
to find matching pairs of content words or terms in a pair of same-domain non-parallel bilingual

Figure 9: Translator improvement on term translation 
texts. Evaluation shows a precision of about 30%. We showed that humans are able to translate 
more than twice as many Japanese technical terms into English when our system output is used, 
compared to translating a random set of 19 Japanese terms without aid. It is also a significant initial 
result for lexical translation from truly non-parallel corpora, particularly across language groups. 
For future work, the quality of seed words can be improved by using a training algorithm to 
select seed words according to their discriminative power. The dimensionality of WoRM vectors we 
have chosen is not optimal. A high dimeusionality of vectors is usually favorable (Gale & Church 
1994). On the other hand, high dimeusionality can also lead to noise, Therefore, dimensionality 
reduction methods uch as the Singular Value Decomposition (Shiitze 1992) or clustering is often 
used. In our case, this means that we should choose a large subset of highly discriminative s ed 
word pairs. Additionally, the Word Relation Matrix could be used in combination with other word 
siguature featur~ for non-parallel corpora. 
In addition to the evaluation results, we have also discovered that the content words in the same 
segment with a word or term all contribute to the occurrence of this word. This feature represents 
201 
some of the long-distance relations between the word and multiple other words which are not its 
immediate neighbors. The information can be used in language modeling in addition to the currently
