Abstract
We investigate authorship attribution using
classifiers based on frame semantics. The pur-
pose is to discover whether adding semantic
information to lexical and syntactic methods
for authorship attribution will improve them,
specifically to address the difficult problem of
authorship attribution of translated texts. Our
results suggest (i) that frame-based classifiers
are usable for author attribution of both trans-
lated and untranslated texts; (ii) that frame-
based classifiers generally perform worse than
the baseline classifiers for untranslated texts,
but (iii) perform as well as, or superior to
the baseline classifiers on translated texts; (iv)
that?contrary to current belief?na?ve clas-
sifiers based on lexical markers may perform
tolerably on translated texts if the combination
of author and translator is present in the train-
ing set of a classifier.
1 Introduction
Authorship attribution is the following problem: For
a given text, determine the author of said text among
a list of candidate authors. Determining author-
ship is difficult, and a host of methods have been
proposed: As of 1998 Rudman estimated the num-
ber of metrics used in such methods to be at least
1000 (Rudman, 1997). For comprehensive recent
surveys see e.g. (Juola, 2006; Koppel et al, 2008;
Stamatatos, 2009). The process of authorship at-
tribution consists of selecting markers (features that
provide an indication of the author), and classifying
a text by assigning it to an author using some appro-
priate machine learning technique.
1.1 Attribution of translated texts
In contrast to the general authorship attribution
problem, the specific problem of attributing trans-
lated texts to their original author has received little
attention. Conceivably, this is due to the common
intuition that the impact of the translator may add
enough noise that proper attribution to the original
author will be very difficult; for example, in (Arun
et al, 2009) it was found that the imprint of the
translator was significantly greater than that of the
original author. The volume of resources for nat-
ural language processing in English appears to be
much larger than for any other language, and it is
thus, conceivably, convenient to use the resources at
hand for a translated version of the text, rather than
the original.
To appreciate the difficulty of purely lexical or
syntactic characterization of authors based on trans-
lation, consider the following excerpts from three
different translations of the first few paragraphs of
Turgenev?s Dvornskoe Gnezdo:
Liza "A nest of nobles" Translated by W. R. Shedden-
Ralston
A beautiful spring day was drawing to a close. High
aloft in the clear sky floated small rosy clouds,
which seemed never to drift past, but to be slowly
absorbed into the blue depths beyond.
At an open window, in a handsome mansion situ-
ated in one of the outlying streets of O., the chief
town of the government of that name?it was in the
year 1842?there were sitting two ladies, the one
about fifty years old, the other an old woman of
seventy.
A Nobleman?s Nest Translated by I. F. Hapgood
The brilliant, spring day was inclining toward the
65
evening, tiny rose-tinted cloudlets hung high in the
heavens, and seemed not to be floating past, but re-
treating into the very depths of the azure.
In front of the open window of a handsome house,
in one of the outlying streets of O * * * the capital
of a Government, sat two women; one fifty years of
age, the other seventy years old, and already aged.
A House of Gentlefolk Translated by C. Garnett
A bright spring day was fading into evening. High
overhead in the clear heavens small rosy clouds
seemed hardly to move across the sky but to be
sinking into its depths of blue.
In a handsome house in one of the outlying streets
of the government town of O?- (it was in the year
1842) two women were sitting at an open window;
one was about fifty, the other an old lady of seventy.
As translators express the same semantic content
in different ways the syntax and style of different
translations of the same text will differ greatly due
to the footprint of the translators; this footprint may
affect the classification process in different ways de-
pending on the features.
For markers based on language structure such as
grammar or function words it is to be expected that
the footprint of the translator has such a high im-
pact on the resulting text that attribution to the au-
thor may not be possible. However, it is possi-
ble that a specific author/translator combination has
its own unique footprint discernible from other au-
thor/translator combinations: A specific translator
may often translate often used phrases in the same
way. Ideally, the footprint of the author is (more or
less) unaffected by the process of translation, for ex-
ample if the languages are very similar or the marker
is not based solely on lexical or syntactic features.
In contrast to purely lexical or syntactic features,
the semantic content is expected to be, roughly, the
same in translations and originals. This leads us to
hypothesize that a marker based on semantic frames
such as found in the FrameNet database (Ruppen-
hofer et al, 2006), will be largely unaffected by
translations, whereas traditional lexical markers will
be severely impacted by the footprint of the transla-
tor.
The FrameNet project is a database of annotated
exemplar frames, their relations to other frames and
obligatory as well as optional frame elements for
each frame. FrameNet currently numbers approxi-
mately 1000 different frames annotated with natural
language examples. In this paper, we combine the
data from FrameNet with the LTH semantic parser
(Johansson and Nugues, 2007), until very recently
(Das et al, 2010) the semantic parser with best ex-
perimental performance (note that the performance
of LTH on our corpora is unknown and may dif-
fer from the numbers reported in (Johansson and
Nugues, 2007)).
1.2 Related work
The research on authorship attribution is too volu-
minous to include; see the excellent surveys (Juola,
2006; Koppel et al, 2008; Stamatatos, 2009) for
an overview of the plethora of lexical and syntac-
tic markers used. The literature on the use of se-
mantic markers is much scarcer: Gamon (Gamon,
2004) developed a tool for producing semantic de-
pendency graphs and using the resulting information
in conjunction with lexical and syntactic markers to
improve the accuracy of classification. McCarthy
et al (McCarthy et al, 2006) employed WordNet
and latent semantic analysis to lexical features with
the purpose of finding semantic similarities between
words; it is not clear whether the use of semantic
features improved the classification. Argamon et
al. (Argamon, 2007) used systemic functional gram-
mars to define a feature set associating single words
or phrases with semantic information (an approach
reminiscent of frames); Experiments of authorship
identification on a corpus of English novels of the
19th century showed that the features could improve
the classification results when combined with tra-
ditional function word features. Apart from a few
studies (Arun et al, 2009; Holmes, 1992; Archer et
al., 1997), the problem of attributing translated texts
appears to be fairly untouched.
2 Corpus and resource selection
As pointed out in (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010) the
size of data set and number of authors may crucially
affect the efficiency of author attribution methods,
and evaluation of the method on some standard cor-
pus is essential (Stamatatos, 2009).
Closest to a standard corpus for author attribu-
tion is The Federalist Papers (Juola, 2006), origi-
nally used by Mosteller and Wallace (Mosteller and
Wallace, 1964), and we employ the subset of this
66
corpus consisting of the 71 undisputed single-author
documents as our Corpus I.
For translated texts, a mix of authors and transla-
tors across authors is needed to ensure that the at-
tribution methods do not attribute to the translator
instead of the author. However, there does not ap-
pear to be a large corpus of texts publicly available
that satisfy this demand.
Based on this, we elected to compile a fresh cor-
pus of translated texts; our Corpus II consists of En-
glish translations of 19th century Russian romantic
literature chosen from Project Gutenberg for which
a number of different versions, with different trans-
lators existed. The corpus primarily consists of nov-
els, but is slightly polluted by a few collections of
short stories and two nonfiction works by Tolstoy
due to the necessity of including a reasonable mix
of authors and translators. The corpus consists of 30
texts by 4 different authors and 12 different transla-
tors of which some have translated several different
authors. The texts range in size from 200 (Turgenev:
The Rendezvous) to 33000 (Tolstoy: War and Peace)
sentences.
The option of splitting the corpus into an artifi-
cially larger corpus by sampling sentences for each
author and collating these into a large number of new
documents was discarded; we deemed that the sam-
pling could inadvertently both smooth differences
between the original texts and smooth differences in
the translators? footprints. This could have resulted
in an inaccurate positive bias in the evaluation re-
sults.
3 Experiment design
For both corpora, authorship attribution experiments
were performed using six classifiers, each employ-
ing a distinct feature set. For each feature set the
markers were counted in the text and their relative
frequencies calculated. Feature selection was based
solely on training data in the inner loop of the cross-
validation cycle. Two sets of experiments were per-
formed, each with with X = 200 and X = 400
features; the size of the feature vector was kept con-
stant across comparison of methods, due to space
constraints only results for 400 features are reported.
The feature sets were:
Frequent Words (FW): Frequencies in the text of
the X most frequent words1. Classification
with this feature set is used as baseline.
Character N-grams: The X most frequent N-
grams for N = 3, 4, 5.
Frames: The relative frequencies of the X most
frequently occurring semantic frames.
Frequent Words and Frames (FWaF): The X/2
most frequent features; words and frames resp.
combined to a single feature vector of size X .
In order to gauge the impact of translation upon an
author?s footprint, three different experiments were
performed on subsets of Corpus II:
The full corpus of 30 texts [Corpus IIa] was used
for authorship attribution with an ample mix of au-
thors an translators, several translators having trans-
lated texts by more than one author. To ascertain
how heavily each marker is influenced by translation
we also performed translator attribution on a sub-
set of 11 texts [Corpus IIb] with 3 different transla-
tors each having translated 3 different authors. If the
translator leaves a heavy footprint on the marker, the
marker is expected to score better when attributing
to translator than to author. Finally, we reduced the
corpus to a set of 18 texts [Corpus IIc] that only in-
cludes unique author/translator combinations to see
if each marker could attribute correctly to an author
if the translator/author combination was not present
in the training set.
All classification experiments were conducted
using a multi-class winner-takes-all (Duan and
Keerthi, 2005) support vector machine (SVM). For
cross-validation, all experiments used leave-one-out
(i.e. N -fold for N texts in the corpus) validation.
All features were scaled to lie in the range [0, 1] be-
fore different types of features were combined. In
each step of the cross-validation process, the most
frequently occurring features were selected from the
training data, and to minimize the effect of skewed
training data on the results, oversampling with sub-
stitution was used on the training data.

4 Results and evaluation
We tested our results for statistical significance us-
ing McNemar?s test (McNemar, 1947) with Yates?
correction for continuity (Yates, 1934) against the
null hypothesis that the classifier is indistinguishable
from a random attribution weighted by the number
of author texts in the corpus.

FWaF performed better than FW for attribution of
author on translated texts. However, the difference
failed to be statistically significant.
Results of the experiments are reported in the ta-
ble below. For each corpus results are given for
experiments with 400 features. We report macro2
precision/recall, and the corresponding F1 and ac-
curacy scores; the best scoring result in each row is
shown in boldface. For each corpus the bottom row
indicates whether each classifier is significantly dis-
cernible from a weighted random attribution.

4.1 Corpus I: The Federalist Papers
For the Federalist Papers the traditional authorship
attribution markers all lie in the 95+ range in accu-
racy as expected. However, the frame-based mark-
ers achieved statistically significant results, and can
hence be used for authorship attribution on untrans-
lated documents (but performs worse than the base-
line). FWaF did not result in an improvement over
FW.
4.2 Corpus II: Attribution of translated texts
For Corpus IIa?the entire corpus of translated texts?
all methods achieve results significantly better than
random, and FWaF is the best-scoring method, fol-
lowed by FW.
The results for Corpus IIb (three authors, three
translators) clearly suggest that the footprint of the
translator is evident in the translated texts, and that
the FW (function word) classifier is particularly sen-
sitive to the footprint. In fact, FW was the only one
achieving a significant result over random assign-
ment, giving an indication that this marker may be
particularly vulnerable to translator influence when
attempting to attribute authors.
For Corpus IIc (unique author/translator combina-
tions) decreased performance of all methods is evi-
dent. Some of this can be attributed to a smaller
(training) corpus, but we also suspect the lack of
several instances of the same author/translator com-
binations in the corpus.
Observe that the FWaF classifier is the only
classifier with significantly better performance than
weighted random assignment, and outperforms the
other methods. Frames alone also outperform tradi-
tional markers, albeit not by much.
The experiments on the collected corpora strongly
suggest the feasibility of using Frames as markers
for authorship attribution, in particular in combina-
tion with traditional lexical approaches.
Our inability to obtain demonstrably significant
improvement of FWaF over the approach based on
Frequent Words is likely an artifact of the fairly
small corpus we employ. However, computation of
significance is generally woefully absent from stud-
ies of automated author attribution, so it is conceiv-
able that the apparent improvement shown in many
such studies fail to be statistically significant under
68
closer scrutiny (note that the exact tests to employ
for statistical significance in information retrieval?
including text categorization?is a subject of con-
tention (Smucker et al, 2007)).
5 Conclusions, caveats, and future work
We have investigated the use of semantic frames as
markers for author attribution and tested their appli-
cability to attribution of translated texts. Our results
show that frames are potentially useful, especially
so for translated texts, and suggest that a combined
method of frequent words and frames can outper-
form methods based solely on traditional markers,
on translated texts. For attribution of untranslated
texts and attribution to translator traditional markers
such as frequent words and n-grams are still to be
preferred.
Our test corpora consist of a limited number of
authors, from a limited time period, with translators
from a similar limited time period and cultural con-
text. Furthermore, our translations are all from a sin-
gle language. Thus, further work is needed before
firm conclusions regarding the general applicability
of the methods can be made.
It is well known that effectiveness of authorship
markers may be influenced by topics (Stein et al,
2007; Schein et al, 2010); while we have endeav-
ored to design our corpora to minimize such influ-
ence, we do not currently know the quantitative im-
pact on topicality on the attribution methods in this
paper. Furthermore, traditional investigations of au-
thorship attribution have focused on the case of at-
tributing texts among a small (N < 10) class of
authors at the time, albeit with recent, notable ex-
ceptions (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010; Koppel et
al., 2010). We test our methods on similarly re-
stricted sets of authors; the scalability of the meth-
ods to larger numbers of authors is currently un-
known. Combining several classification methods
into an ensemble method may yield improvements
in precision (Raghavan et al, 2010); it would be
interesting to see whether a classifier using frames
yields significant improvements in ensemble with
other methods. Finally, the distribution of frames in
texts is distinctly different from the distribution of
words: While there are function words, there are no
?function frames?, and certain frames that are com-
mon in a corpus may fail to occur in the training
material of a given author; it is thus conceivable that
smoothing would improve classification by frames
more than by words or N-grams.
