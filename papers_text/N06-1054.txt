Abstract
We describe finite-state constraint relaxation, a method for ap-
plying global constraints, expressed as automata, to sequence
model decoding. We present algorithms for both hard con-
straints and binary soft constraints. On the CoNLL-2004 se-
mantic role labeling task, we report a speedup of at least 16x
over a previous method that used integer linear programming.
1 Introduction
Many tasks in natural language processing involve
sequence labeling. If one models long-distance or
global properties of labeled sequences, it can be-
come intractable to find (?decode?) the best labeling
of an unlabeled sequence.
Nonetheless, such global properties can improve
the accuracy of a model, so recent NLP papers
have considered practical techniques for decod-
ing with them. Such techniques include Gibbs
sampling (Finkel et al, 2005), a general-purpose
Monte Carlo method, and integer linear program-
ming (ILP), (Roth and Yih, 2005), a general-purpose
exact framework for NP-complete problems.
Under generative models such as hidden Markov
models, the probability of a labeled sequence de-
pends only on its local properties. The situation
improves with discriminatively trained models, such
as conditional random fields (Lafferty et al, 2001),
which do efficiently allow features that are functions
of the entire observation sequence. However, these
features can still only look locally at the label se-
quence. That is a significant shortcoming, because
in many domains, hard or soft global constraints on
the label sequence are motivated by common sense:
? For named entity recognition, a phrase that
appears multiple times should tend to get the
same label each time (Finkel et al, 2005).
? In bibliography entries (Peng and McCallum,
2004), a given field (author, title, etc.) should
be filled by at most one substring of the in-
put, and there are strong preferences on the co-
occurrence and order of certain fields.
? In seminar announcements, a given field
(speaker, start time, etc.) should appear with
at most one value in each announcement, al-
though the field and value may be repeated
(Finkel et al, 2005).
? For semantic role labeling, each argument
should be instantiated only once for a given
verb. There are several other constraints that
we will describe later (Roth and Yih, 2005).
A popular approximate technique is to hypothe-
size a list of possible answers by decoding without
any global constraints, and then rerank (or prune)
this n-best list using the full model with all con-
straints. Reranking relies on the local model being
?good enough? that the globally best answer appears
in its n-best list. Otherwise, reranking can?t find it.
In this paper, we propose ?constraint relaxation,?
a simple exact alternative to reranking. As in rerank-
ing, we start with a weighted lattice of hypotheses
proposed by the local model. But rather than restrict
to the n best of these according to the local model,
we aim to directly extract the one best according to
the global model. As in reranking, we hope that the
local constraints alone will work well, but if they do
not, the penalty is not incorrect decoding, but longer
runtime as we gradually fold the global constraints
into the lattice. Constraint relaxation can be used
whenever the global constraints can be expressed as
regular languages over the label sequence.
In the worst case, our runtime may be exponential
in the number of constraints, since we are consider-
ing an intractable class of problems. However, we
show that in practice, the method is quite effective
at rapid decoding under global hard constraints.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: In ?2 we describe how finite-state automata
can be used to apply global constraints. We then
give a brute-force decoding algorithm (?3). In ?4,
we present a more efficient algorithm for the case of
hard constraints. We report results for the semantic
role labeling task in ?5. ?6 treats soft constraints.
2 Finite-state constraints
Previous approaches to global sequence labeling?
Gibbs sampling, ILP, and reranking?seem moti-
vated by the idea that standard sequence methods are
incapable of considering global constraints at all.
In fact, finite-state automata (FSAs) are powerful
enough to express many long-distance constraints.
Since all finite languages are regular, any constraint
over label sequences of bounded length is finite-
state. FSAs are more powerful than n-gram mod-
els. For example, the regular expression ??X??Y??
matches only sequences of labels that contain an X
before a Y. Similarly, the regular expression ?(O?)
requires at least one non-O label; it compiles into the
FSA of Figure 1.
Note that this FSA is in one or the other of its two
states according to whether it has encountered a non-
O label yet. In general, the current state of an FSA
records properties of the label sequence prefix read
so far. The FSA needs enough states to keep track of
whether the label sequence as a whole satisfies the
global constraint in question.
FSAs are a flexible approach to constraints be-
cause they are closed under logical operations such
as disjunction (union) and conjunction (intersec-
tion). They may be specified by regular expressions
(Karttunen et al, 1996), in a logical language (Vail-
lette, 2004), or directly as FSAs. They may also be
weighted to express soft constraints.
Formally, we pose the decoding problem in terms
of an observation sequence x ? X ? and possible la-
bel sequences y ? Y?. In many NLP tasks, X is the
set of words, and Y the tags. A lattice L: Y? 7? R
maps label sequences to weights, and is encoded as a
weighted FSA. Constraints are formally the same?
any function C: Y? 7? R is a constraint, includ-
ing weighted features from a classifier or probabilis-
tic model. In this paper we will consider only con-
straints that are weighted in particular ways.
Given a lattice L and constraints C, we seek
y?
def
= argmax
y
(
L(y) +
?
C?C
C(y)
)
. (1)
We assume the lattice L is generated by a model
M : X ? 7? (Y? 7? R). For a given observation se-
quence x, we put L = M(x). One possible model
is a finite-state transducer, where M(x) is an FSA
found by composing the transducer with x. Another
is a CRF, where M(x) is a lattice with sums of log-
potentials for arc weights.1
3 A brute-force finite-state decoder
To find the best constrained labeling in a lattice, y?,
according to (1), we could simply intersect the lat-
tice with all the constraints, then extract the best
path.
Weighted FSA intersection is a generalization of
ordinary unweighted FSA intersection (Mohri et al,
1996). It is customary in NLP to use the so-called
tropical semiring, where weights are represented by
their natural logarithms and summed rather than
multiplied. Then the intersected automaton L ? C
computes
(L ? C)(y)
def
= L(y) + C(y) (2)
To find y?, one would extract the best path in
L ? C1 ? C2 ? ? ? ? using the Viterbi algorithm, or
Dijkstra?s algorithm if the lattice is cyclic. This step
is fast if the intersected automaton is small.
The problem is that the multiple intersections in
L ? C1 ? C2 ? ? ? ? can quickly lead to an FSA with
an intractable number of states. The intersection
of two finite-state automata produces an automaton
1For example, if M is a simple linear-chain CRF, L(y) =Pn
i=1 f(yi?1, yi) + g(xi, yi). We build L = M(x) as an
acyclic FSA whose state set is Y ? {1, 2, . . . n}, with transi-
tions (y?, i? 1) ? (y, i) of weight f(y?, y) + g(xi, y).
424
with the cross product state set. That is, if F has m
states and G has n states, then F ?G has up to mn
states (fewer if some of the mn possible states do
not lie on any accepting path).
Intersection of many such constraints, even if they
have only a few states each, quickly leads to a com-
binatorial explosion. In the worst case, the size, in
states, of the resulting lattice is exponential in the
number of constraints. To deal with this, we present
a constraint relaxation algorithm.
4 Hard constraints
The simplest kind of constraint is the hard con-
straint. Hard constraints are necessarily binary?
either the labeling satisfies the constraint, or it vi-
olates it. Violation is fatal?the labeling produced
by decoding must satisfy each hard constraint.
Formally, a hard constraint is a mappingC: Y? 7?
{0,??}, encoded as an unweighted FSA. If a string
satisfies the constraint, recognition of the string will
lead to an accepting state. If it violates the con-
straint, recognition will end in a non-accepting state.
Here we give an algorithm for decoding with a set
of such constraints. Later (?6), we discuss the case
of binary soft constraints. In what follows, we will
assume that there is always at least one path in the
lattice that satisfies all of the constraints.
4.1 Decoding by constraint relaxation
Our decoding algorithm first relaxes the global con-
straints and solves a simpler problem. In particular,
we find the best labeling according to the model,
y?0
def
= argmax
y
L(y) (3)
ignoring all the constraints in C.
Next, we check whether y?0 satisifies the con-
straints. If so, then we are done?y?0 is also y?. If
not, then we reintroduce the constraints. However,
rather than include all at once, we introduce them
only as they are violated by successive solutions to
the relaxed problems: y?0, y?1, etc. We define
y?1
def
= argmax
y
(L(y) + C(y)) (4)
for some constraint C that y?0 violates. Similarly,
y?2 satisfies an additional constraint that y?1 violates,
HARD-CONSTRAIN-LATTICE(L, C):
1. y := Best-Path(L)
2. while ?C ? C such that C(y) = ??:
3. L := L ? C
4. C := C ? {C}
5. y := Best-Path(L)
6. return y
Figure 2: Hard constraints decoding algorithm.
and so on. Eventually, we find some k for which y?k
satisfies all constraints, and this path is returned.
To determine whether a labeling y satisfies a con-
straint C, we represent y as a straight-line automa-
ton and intersect with C, checking the result for non-
emptiness. This is equivalent to string recognition.
Our hope is that, although intractable in the worst
case, the constraint relaxation algorithm will operate
efficiently in practice. The success of traditional se-
quence models on NLP tasks suggests that, for nat-
ural language, much of the correct analysis can be
recovered from local features and constraints alone.
We suspect that, as a result, global constraints will
often be easy to satisfy.
Pseudocode for the algorithm appears in Figure 2.
Note that line 2 does not specify how to choose
C from among multiple violated constraints. This
is discussed in ?7. Our algorithm resembles the
method of Koskenniemi (1990) and later work. The
difference is that there lattices are unweighted and
may not contain a path that satisfies all constraints,
so that the order of constraint intersection matters.
5 Semantic role labeling
The semantic role labeling task (Carreras and
Ma`rques, 2004) involves choosing instantiations of
verb arguments from a sentence for a given verb.
The verb and its arguments form a proposition. We
use data from the CoNLL-2004 shared task?the
PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) annotations of the
Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993), with sections
15?18 as the training set and section 20 as the de-
velopment set. Unless otherwise specified, all mea-
surements are made on the development set.
We follow Roth and Yih (2005) exactly, in order
to compare system runtimes. They, in turn, follow
Hacioglu et al (2004) and others in labeling only
the heads of syntactic chunks rather than all words.
We label only the core arguments (A0?A5), treating

adjuncts and references as O.
Figure 3 shows an example sentence from the
shared task. It is marked with an IOB phrase chunk-
ing, the heads of the phrases, and the correct seman-
tic role labeling. Heads are taken to be the rightmost
words of chunks. On average, there are 18.8 phrases
per proposition, vs. 23.5 words per sentence. Sen-
tences may contain multiple propositions. There are
4305 propositions in section 20.
5.1 Constraints
Roth and Yih use five global constraints on label se-
quences for the semantic role labeling task. We ex-
press these constraints as FSAs. The first two are
general, and the seven automata encoding them can
be constructed offline:
? NO DUPLICATE ARGUMENT LABELS
(Fig. 4(a)) requires that each verb have at
most one argument of each type in a given
sentence. We separate this into six individual
constraints, one for each core argument type.
Thus, we have constraints called NO DUPLI-
CATE A0, NO DUPLICATE A1, etc. Each of
these is represented as a three-state FSA.
? AT LEAST ONE ARGUMENT (Fig. 1) simply re-
quires that the label sequence is not O?. This is
a two-state automaton as described in ?2.
The last three constraints require information
about the example, and the automata must be con-
structed on a per-example basis:
? ARGUMENT CANDIDATES (Fig. 5) encodes a
set of position spans each of which must re-
ceive only a single label type. These spans were
proposed using a high-recall heuristic (Xue and
Palmer, 2004).
? KNOWN VERB POSITION (Fig. 4(b)) simply
encodes the position of the verb in question,
which must be labeled O.
? DISALLOW ARGUMENTS (Fig. 4(c)) specifies
argument types that are compatible with the
verb in question, according to PropBank.
5.2 Experiments
We implemented our hard constraint relaxation al-
gorithm, using the FSA toolkit (Kanthak and Ney,
2004) for finite-state operations. FSA is an open-
source C++ library providing a useful set of algo-
rithms on weighted finite-state acceptors and trans-
ducers. For each example we decoded, we chose a
random order in which to apply the constraints.
Lattices are generated from what amounts to a
unigram model?the voted perceptron classifier of
Roth and Yih. The features used are a subset of those
commonly applied to the task.
Our system produces output identical to that of
Roth and Yih. Table 1 shows F-measure on the core
arguments. Table 2 shows a runtime comparison.
The ILP runtime was provided by the authors (per-
sonal communication). Because the systems were
run under different conditions, the times are not di-
rectly comparable. However, constraint relaxation is
more than sixteen times faster than ILP despite run-
ning on a slower platform.
5.2.1 Comparison to an ILP solver
Roth and Yih?s linear program has two kinds of
numeric constraints. Some encode the shortest path
problem structure; the others encode the global con-
straints of ?5.1. The ILP solver works by relaxing
to a (real-valued) linear program, which may obtain
a fractional solution that represents a path mixture
instead of a path. It then uses branch-and-bound to
seek the optimal rounding of this fractional solution
to an integer solution (Gue?ret et al, 2002) that repre-
sents a single path satisfying the global constraints.
Our method avoids fractional solutions: a relaxed
solution is always a true single path, which either

satisfies or violates each global constraint. In effect,
we are using two kinds of domain knowledge. First,
we recognize that this is a graph problem, and insist
on true paths so we can use Viterbi decoding. Sec-
ond, we choose to relax only domain-specific con-
straints that are likely to be satisfied anyway (in our
domain), in contrast to the meta-constraint of inte-
grality relaxed by ILP. Thus it is cheaper on aver-
age for us to repair a relaxed solution. (Our repair
strategy?finite-state intersection in place of branch-
and-bound search?remains expensive in the worst
case, as the problem is NP-hard.)
5.2.2 Constraint violations
The y?0s, generated with only local information,
satisfy most of the global constraints most of the
time. Table 3 shows the violations by type.
The majority of best labelings according to the
local model don?t violate any global constraints?
a fact especially remarkable because there are no
label sequence features in Roth and Yih?s unigram

guage structure is largely apparent locally. Table 4
shows the breakdown. The majority of examples are
very efficient to decode, because they don?t require
intersection of the lattice with any constraints?y?0
is extracted and is good enough. Those examples
where constraints are violated are still relatively effi-
cient because they only require a small number of in-
tersections. In total, the average number of intersec-
tions needed, even with the naive randomized con-
straint ordering, was only 0.65. The order doesn?t
matter very much, since 75% of examples have one
violation or fewer.

olated constraints on the average size of lattices,

The X at k = 3 shows the final size of the brute-force

For the most part, our lattices do stay much
smaller than those produced by the brute-force algo-
rithm. (The uppermost curve, k = 5, is an obvious
exception; however, that curve describes only the
seven hardest examples.) Note that plotting only the
final size of the brute-force lattice obscures the long
trajectory of its construction, which involves 10 in-
tersections and, like the trajectories shown, includes
larger intermediate automata.2 This explains the far

longer runtime of the brute-force method (Table 2).
Harder examples (corresponding to longer trajec-
tories) have larger lattices, on average. This is partly
just because it is disproportionately the longer sen-
tences that are hard: they have more opportunities
for a relaxed decoding to violate global constraints.
Hard examples are rare. The left three columns,
requiring only 0?2 intersections, constitute 96% of
examples. The vast majority can be decoded without
much more than doubling the local-lattice size.
6 Soft constraints
The gold standard labels y? occasionally violate the
hard global constraints that we are using. Counts
for the development set appear in Table 5. Counts
for violations of NO DUPLICATE A? do not include
discontinous arguments, of which there are 104 in-
stances, since we ignore them.
Because of the infrequency, the hard constraints
still help most of the time. However, on a small sub-
set of the examples, they preclude us from inferring
the correct labeling.
We can apply these constraints with weights,
rather than making them inviolable. This constitutes
a transition from hard to soft constraints. Formally,
a soft constraint C: Y? 7? R? is a mapping from a
label sequence to a non-positive penalty.
Soft constraints present new difficulty for decod-
clusion of, for example, DISALLOW ARGUMENTS, which can
only remove arcs. That constraint is rarely included in the re-
laxation lattices because it is rarely violated (see Table 3).

ing, because instead of eliminating paths of L from
contention, they just reweight them.
In what follows, we consider only binary soft
constraints?they are either satisfied or violated, and
the same penalty is assessed whenever a violation
occurs. That is, ?C ? C,?wC < 0 such that
?y, C(y) ? {0, wC}.
6.1 Soft constraint relaxation
The decoding algorithm for soft constraints is a gen-
eralization of that for hard constraints. The differ-
ence is that, whereas with hard constraints a vio-
lation meant disqualification, here violation simply
means a penalty. We therefore must find and com-
pare two labelings: the best that satisfies the con-
straint, and the best that violates it.
We present a branch-and-bound algorithm
(Lawler and Wood, 1966), with pseudocode in
Figure 7. At line 9, we process and eliminate a
currently violated constraint C ? C by considering
two cases. On the first branch, we insist that C be
satisfied, enqueuing L ? C for later exploration. On
the second branch, we assume C is violated by all
paths, and so continue considering L unmodified,
but accept a penalty for doing so; we immediately
explore the second branch by returning to the start
of the for loop.3
Not every branch needs to be completely ex-
plored. Bounding is handled by the PRUNE func-
tion at line 4, which shrinks L by removing some
3It is possible that a future best path on the second branch
will not actually violate C, in which case we have overpenalized
it, but in that case we will also find it with correct penalty on the
first branch.
or all paths that cannot score better than Score(y?),
the score of the best path found on any branch so
far. Our experiments used almost the simplest possi-
ble PRUNE: replace L by the empty lattice if the best
path falls below the bound, else leave L unchanged.4
A similar bounding would be possible in the im-
plicit branches. If, during the for loop, we find that
the test at line 12 would fail, we can quit the for
loop and immediately move to the next branch in
the queue at line 3.
There are two factors in this algorithm that con-
tribute to avoiding consideration of all of the expo-
nential number of leaves corresponding to the power
set of constraints. First, bounding stops evaluation
of subtrees. Second, only violated constraints re-
quire branching. If a lattice?s best path satisifies a
constraint, then the best path that violates it can be
no better since, by assumption, ?y, C(y) ? 0.
6.2 Runtime experiments
Using the ten constraints from ?5.1, weighted
naively by their log odds of violation, the soft con-
straint relaxation algorithm runs in a time of 58.40
seconds. It is, as expected, slower than hard con-
straint relaxation, but only by a factor of about two.
As a side note, softening these particular con-
straints in this particular way did not improve de-
coding quality in this case. It might help to jointly
train the relative weights of these constraints and
the local model?e.g., using a perceptron algorithm
(Freund and Schapire, 1998), which repeatedly ex-
tracts the best global path (using our algorithm),
compares it to the gold standard, and adjusts the con-
straint weights. An obvious alternative is maximum-
entropy training, but the partition function would
have to be computed using the large brute-force lat-
tices, or else approximated by a sampling method.
7 Future work
For a given task, we may be able to obtain further
speedups by carefully choosing the order in which
to test and apply the constraints. We might treat this
as a reinforcement learning problem (Sutton, 1988),
4Partial pruning is also possible: by running the Viterbi ver-
sion of the forward-backward algorithm, one can discover for
each edge the weight of the best path on which it appears. One
can then remove all edges that do not appear on any sufficiently
good path.

where an agent will obtain rewards by finding y?
quickly. In the hard-constraint algorithm, for ex-
ample, the agent?s possible moves are to test some
constraint for violation by the current best path, or
to intersect some constraint with the current lattice.
Several features can help the agent choose the next
move. How large is the current lattice, which con-
straints does it already incorporate, and which re-
maining constraints are already known to be satis-
fied or violated by its best path? And what were the
answers to those questions at previous stages?
Our constraint relaxation method should be tested
on problems other than semantic role labeling. For
example, information extraction from bibliography
entries, as discussed in ?1, has about 13 fields to ex-
tract, and interesting hard and soft global constraints
on co-occurrence, order, and adjacency. The method
should also be evaluated on a task with longer se-
quences: though the finite-state operations we use
do scale up linearly with the sequence length, longer
sequences have more chance of violating a global
constraint somewhere in the sequence, requiring us
to apply that constraint explicitly.
8 Conclusion
Roth and Yih (2005) showed that global constraints
can improve the output of sequence labeling models
for semantic role labeling. In general, decoding un-
der such constraints is NP-complete. We exhibited
a practical approach, finite-state constraint relax-
ation, that greatly sped up decoding on this NLP task
by using familiar finite-state operations?weighted
FSA intersection and best-path extraction?rather
than integer linear programming.
We have also given a constraint relaxation algo-
rithm for binary soft constraints. This allows incor-
poration of constraints akin to reranking features, in
addition to inviolable constraints.
