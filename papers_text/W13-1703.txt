Abstract
We describe the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE), a large, fully annotated cor-
pus of learner English that is freely available
for research purposes. The goal of the cor-
pus is to provide a large data resource for the
development and evaluation of grammatical
error correction systems. Although NUCLE
has been available for almost two years, there
has been no reference paper that describes the
corpus in detail. In this paper, we address
this need. We describe the annotation schema
and the data collection and annotation process
of NUCLE. Most importantly, we report on
an unpublished study of annotator agreement
for grammatical error correction. Finally, we
present statistics on the distribution of gram-
matical errors in the NUCLE corpus.
1 Introduction
Grammatical error correction for language learners
has recently attracted increasing interest in the natu-
ral language processing (NLP) community. Gram-
matical error correction has the potential to cre-
ate commercially viable software tools for the large
number of students around the world who are
studying a foreign language, in particular the large
number of students of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage (EFL).
The success of statistical methods in NLP over
the last two decades can largely be attributed to
advances in machine learning and the availability
of large, annotated corpora that can be used to
train and evaluate statistical models for various NLP
tasks. The biggest obstacle for grammatical error
correction has been that until recently, there was no
large, annotated corpus of learner text that could
have served as a standard resource for empirical ap-
proaches to grammatical error correction (Leacock
et al, 2010). The existing annotated learner corpora
were all either too small or proprietary and not avail-
able to the research community. That is why we
decided to create the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE), a large, annotated corpus of learner
texts that is freely available for research purposes.
The corpus was built in collaboration with the Cen-
tre for English Language Communication (CELC)
at NUS. NUCLE consists of about 1,400 student es-
says from undergraduate university students at NUS
with a total of over one million words which are
completely annotated with error tags and correc-
tions. All annotations and corrections have been per-
formed by professional English instructors. To the
best of our knowledge, NUCLE is the first annotated
learner corpus of this size that is freely available for
research purposes. However, although the NUCLE
corpus has been available for almost two years now,
there has been no reference paper that describes the
details of the corpus. That makes it harder for other
researchers to start working with the NUCLE cor-
pus. In this paper, we address this need by giving a
detailed description of the NUCLE corpus, includ-
ing a description of the annotation schema, the data
collection and annotation process, and various statis-
tics on the distribution of grammatical errors in the
corpus. Most importantly, we report on an unpub-
lished study of annotator agreement for grammatical
error correction that was conducted prior to creating

the NUCLE corpus. The study gives some insights
regarding the difficulty of the annotation task.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. The next section explains the annotation
schema that was used for labeling grammatical er-
rors. Section 3 reports the results of the inter-
annotator agreement study. Section 4 describes the
data collection and annotation process. Section 5
contains the error statistics. Section 6 gives the re-
lated work, and Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Annotation Schema
Before starting the corpus creation, we had to de-
velop a set of annotation guidelines. This was done
in a pilot study before the actual corpus was cre-
ated. Three instructors from CELC participated in
the pilot study. The instructors annotated a small set
of student essays that had been collected by CELC
previously. The annotation was performed using an
in-house, online annotation tool, calledWriting, An-
notation, and Marking Platform (WAMP), that was
developed by the NUS NLP group specially for cre-
ating the NUCLE corpus. The annotation tool al-
lows the annotators to work over the Internet using
a web browser. Figure 1 shows a screen shot of the
WAMP interface. Annotators can browse through a
batch of essays that has been assigned to them and
perform the following tasks:
? Select arbitrary, contiguous text spans using the
cursor to identify grammatical errors.
? Classify errors by choosing an error tag from a
drop-down menu.
? Correct errors by typing the correction into a
text box.
? Comment to give additional explanations if
necessary.
We wanted to impose as few constraints as possi-
ble on the annotators and to give them an experience
that would closely resemble their usual marking us-
ing pen and paper. Therefore, the WAMP annotation
tool allows annotators to select arbitrary text spans,
including overlapping text spans.
After some annotation trials, we decided to use
a tag set which had been developed by CELC in
a previous study. Some minor modifications were
made to the original tag set based on the feedback
of the annotators. The result of the pilot study was
a tag set of 27 error categories which are grouped
into 13 categories. The tag set is listed in Table 1.
It is important to note that our annotation schema
not only labels each grammatical error with an error
category, but also requires an annotator to provide a
suitable correction for the error as well. The anno-
tators were asked to provide a correction that would
fix the grammatical error if the selected text span
containing the grammatical error is replaced with the
correction. If multiple alternative text spans could be
selected, the annotators were asked to select the min-
imal text span so that minimal changes were made to
arrive at the corrected text.
We chose to use the tag set in Table 1 since this
tag set was developed and used in a previous study
at CELC and was found to be a suitable tag set. Fur-
thermore, the tag set offers a reasonable compro-
mise in terms of its complexity. With 27 error cate-
gories, it is sufficiently fine-grained to enable mean-
ingful statistics for different error categories, yet not
as complex as other tag sets that are much larger in
size.
3 Annotator Agreement
How reliably can human annotators agree on
whether a word or sentence is grammatically cor-
rect? The pilot annotation project gave us the op-
portunity to investigate this question in a quantita-
tive analysis. Annotator agreement is also a mea-
sure for how difficult a task is and serves as a test of
whether humans can reliable perform the annotation
task with the given tag set. During the pilot study,
we randomly sampled 100 essays for measuring an-
notator agreement. These essays are part of the pilot

data set and are not included in the official NUCLE
corpus. The essays were then annotated by our three
annotators in a way that each essay was annotated
independently by two annotators. Four essays had to
be discarded as they were of very poor quality and
did not allow for any meaningful correction. This
left us with 96 essays with double annotation.
Comparing two sets of annotation is complicated
by the fact that the set of annotations that corrects
an input text to a corrected output text is ambigu-
ous (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012). In other words, it is
possible that two different sets of annotations pro-
duce the same correction. For example, one anno-
tator could choose to select a whole phrase as one
error, while the other annotator selects each word
individually. Our annotation guidelines ask annota-
tors to select the minimum span that is necessary to
correct the error, but we do not enforce any hard con-
straints and different annotators can have a different
perception of where an error starts or ends.
An especially difficult case is the annotation of
omission errors, for example missing articles. Se-
lecting a range of whitespace characters is difficult
for annotators, especially if the annotation tool is
web-based (as whitespace is variable in web pages).
We asked annotators to select the previous or next
word and include them into the suggested correc-
tion. To change conduct survey to conduct a sur-
vey, the annotator could change conduct to conduct
a, or change survey to a survey. If we only com-
pare the exact text spans selected by the annotators
when measuring agreement, these different ways to
select the context could easily cause us to conclude
that the annotators disagree when they in fact agree
on the corrected phrase. This would lead to an un-
derestimation of annotator agreement. To address
this problem, we perform a simple text span nor-
malization. First, we ?grow? the selected context
to align with whitespace boundaries. For example,
if an annotator just selected the last character e of
the word use and provided ed as a correction, we
grow this annotation so that the whole word use is
selected and used is the correction. Second, we to-
kenize the text and ?trim? the context by removing
tokens at the start and end that are identical in the
original and the correction. Finally, the annotations
are ?projected? onto the individual tokens they span,
i.e., an annotation that spans a phrase of multiple to-

Annotator B : This phenomenon opposes the (real ? reality (Wform)) .
Table 2: Example of a sentence from the annotator agreement study with annotations from two different annotators.
kens is broken up into multiple token-level annota-
tions. We align the tokens in the original text span
and the tokenized correction string using minimum
edit distance. Now, we can compare two annotations
in a more meaningful way at the token level. Table 2
shows a tokenized example sentence from the anno-
tator agreement study with annotations from two dif-
ferent annotators. Annotator A and B agree that the
first three words This, phenomenon, and opposes and
the final period are correct and do not need any cor-
rection. The annotators also agree that the word real
is part of a word form (Wform) error and should be
replaced with reality. However, they disagree with
respect to the article the: annotator A believes there
is an article error (ArtOrDet) and that the article has
to be deleted while annotator B believes that the ar-
ticle is acceptable in this position.
The example shows that annotator agreement can
be measured with respect to three different criteria:
whether there is an error, what type of error it is,
and how the error should be corrected. Accordingly,
we analyze annotator agreement under three differ-
ent conditions:
? Identification Agreement of tagged tokens re-
gardless of error category or correction.
? Classification Agreement of error category,
given identification.
? Exact Agreement of error category and correc-
tion, given identification.
In the identification task, we are interested to see
how well annotators agree on whether something is
a grammatical error or not. In the example above,
annotators A and B agree on 5 out of 6 tokens and
disagree on one token (the). That results in an identi-
fication agreement of 5/6 = 83%. In the classifica-
tion task, we investigate how well annotators agree
on the type of error, given that both have tagged the
token as an error. In the example, the classification
agreement is 100% as both annotator A and B tagged
the word real as a word form (Wform) error. Finally,
for the exact task, annotators are considered to agree
if they agree on the error category and the correction
given that they both have tagged the token as an er-
ror. In the example, the exact agreement is 100% as
both annotators give the same error category Wform
and the same correction reality for the word real. We
use the popular Cohen?s Kappa coefficient (Cohen,
1960) to measure annotator agreement between an-
notators. Cohen?s Kappa is defined as
? =
Pr(a)? Pr(e)
1? Pr(e)
(1)
where Pr(a) is the probability of agreement and
Pr(e) is the probability of chance agreement. We
can estimate Pr(a) and Pr(e) from the double an-
notated essays through maximum likelihood estima-
tion. For two annotators A and B, the probability of
agreement is
Pr(a) =
#agreed tokens
#total tokens
(2)
where the number of agreed tokens is counted as de-
scribed above, and the total number of tokens is the
total token count of the subset of jointly annotated
documents. The probability of chance agreement is
computed as
Pr(e) = Pr(A = 1, B = 1) + Pr(A = 0, B = 0)
= Pr(A = 1)? Pr(B = 1)
+Pr(A = 0)? Pr(B = 0)
where Pr(A = 1) and Pr(A = 0) symbolize the
events of annotator A tagging a token as ?error? or
?no error? respectively. We make use of the fact
that both annotators perform the task independently.
Pr(A = 1) and Pr(A = 0) can be computed
through maximum likelihood estimation.
Pr(A = 1) =
# annotated tokens of annotator A
# total tokens
Pr(A = 0) =
# unannotated tokens of annotator A
# total tokens
26
Annotators Kappa-iden Kappa-class Kappa-exact

A ? C 0.3627 0.5352 0.4956
B ? C 0.3230 0.4894 0.4246
Average 0.3877 0.5484 0.4838
Table 3: Cohen?s Kappa for annotator agreement.
The probabilities Pr(B = 1) and Pr(B = 0) are
computed analogously. The chance agreement for
this task is quite high, as the number of un-annotated
tokens is much higher than the number of annotated
tokens. Cohen?s Kappa coefficients for the three an-
notators and the average Kappa coefficient are listed
in Table 3. We observe that the Kappa scores are
relatively low and that there is a substantial amount
of variability in the Kappa coefficients; annotator A
and B show a higher agreement with each other than
they do with annotator C. According to Landis and
Koch (1977), Kappa scores between 0.21 and 0.40
are considered fair, and scores between 0.41 and
0.60 are considered moderate. The average Kappa
score for identification can therefore only be consid-
ered fair and the Kappa scores for classification and
exact agreement are moderate. Thus, an interesting
result of the pilot study was that annotators find it
harder to agree on whether a word is grammatically
correct than agreeing on the type of error or how it
should be corrected. The annotator agreement study
shows that grammatical error correction, especially
grammatical error identification, is a difficult prob-
lem.
Our findings support previous research on an-
notator agreement that has shown that grammati-
cal error correction is a challenging task (Tetreault
and Chodorow, 2008; Lee et al, 2009). Tetreault
and Chodorow (2008) report a Kappa score of 0.63
which in their words ?shows the difficulty of this
task and also show how two highly trained raters
can produce very different judgments.? An interest-
ing related work is (Lee et al, 2009) which investi-
gates the annotation of article and noun number er-
rors. The annotation is performed with either a sin-
gle sentence context only or the five preceding sen-
tences. The agreement between annotators increases
when more context is given, from a Kappa score of
0.55 to a Kappa score of 0.60. Madnani et al (2011)
and Tetreault et al (2010) propose crowdsourcing to
overcome the problem of annotator variability.
4 Data Collection and Annotation
The main data collection for the NUCLE corpus
took place between August and December 2009. We
collected a total of 2,249 student essays from 6 En-
glish courses at CELC. The courses are designed for
students who need language support for their aca-
demic studies. The essays were written as course
assignments on a wide range of topics, like technol-
ogy innovation or health care. Some example ques-
tion prompts are shown in Table 4. All students are
at a similar academic level, as they are all undergrad-
uate students at NUS. Students would typically have
to write two essay assignments during a course. The
length of each essay was supposed to be around 500
words, although most essays were longer than the re-
quired length. From this data set, a team of 10 CELC
English instructors annotated 1,414 essays with over
1.2 million words between October 2009 and April
2010. Due to budget constraints, we were unfortu-
nately not able to perform double annotations for the
main corpus. Annotators were allowed to label an
error multiple times if the error could be assigned
to more than one error tag, although we observed
that annotators did not make much use of this option.
Minimal post-processing was done after the annota-
tion process. Annotators were asked to review some
corrections that appeared to contain annotation mis-
takes, for example redundancy errors that did not re-
move the annotated word. The final results of the
annotation exercise were a total of 46,597 error tags.
The essays and the annotations were released as the
NUCLE corpus through the NUS Enterprise R2M
portal in June 2011. The link to the corpus can be
found on the NUS NLP group?s website1.
5 NUCLE Corpus Statistics
This section provides basic statistics about the NU-
CLE corpus and the collected annotations. These
statistics already reveal some interesting insights
about the nature of grammatical errors in learner
text. In particular, we are interested in the follow-
ing questions: how frequent are errors in the NU-
CLE corpus and what are the most frequent error

Table 5: Overview of the NUCLE corpus
categories? The basic statistics of the NUCLE cor-
pus are shown in Table 5. In these statistics, we
treat multiple alternative annotations for the same
error as separate errors, although it could be argued
that these should be merged into a single error with
multiple alternative corrections. Fortunately, only
about 1% of the errors are labeled with more than
one annotation. We can see that grammatical errors
are very sparse, even in learner text. In the NU-
CLE corpus, there are 46,597 annotated errors for
1,220,257 word tokens. That makes an error density
of 3.82 errors per hundred words. In other words,
most of the word tokens in the corpus are grammat-
ically correct. This shows that the students whose
essays were used for the corpus already have a rel-
ative high proficiency of English. When we look
at the distribution of errors across documents, we
can make another interesting observation. Figure 2
shows a histogram of the number of error annota-
tions per document. The distribution appears non-
Gaussian and is heavily skewed to the left with most
documents having less than 30 errors while some
documents have significantly more errors than the
average document. That means that although gram-
matical errors are rare in general, there are also doc-

uments with many error annotations. 32 documents
have more than 100 error annotations and the highest
number of error annotations in a document is 194.
The mode, i.e., the most frequent value in the his-
togram, is 15 which is to the left of the average of
32.95. A similar pattern can be observed when we
look at the distribution of errors per sentence. Fig-
ure 3 shows a histogram of the number of error anno-
tations per sentence in the NUCLE corpus. For this
histogram, only the error annotations which start and
end within sentence boundaries are considered (this
accounts for 98.6% of all error annotations). Sen-
tence boundaries are determined automatically using
the NLTK Punkt sentence splitter2. The histogram
shows that 57.64% of all sentences have zero errors,
20.48% have exactly one error, and 10.66% have ex-
actly two errors, and 11.21% of all sentences have
more than two errors. Although the frequency de-
creases quickly for higher error counts, the highest
observed number of error annotations for a sentence
is 28.

The skewed distribution of errors in the NUCLE
corpus is an interesting observation. A possible ex-
planation for the long tail of the distribution could be
a ?rich-get-richer? type of dynamics: if a learner has
made a lot of mistakes in her essay so far, the chance
of her making more errors in the remainder of the
essay increases, for example because she makes sys-
tematic errors which are likely to be repeated. Ex-
plaining the cognitive processes that produce the ob-
served error distribution is beyond the scope of this
paper, but it would certainly be an interesting ques-
tion to investigate.
So far, we have only been concerned with how
many errors learners make overall. But it is also
important to understand what types of errors lan-
guage learners make. Error categories that appear
more frequently should be addressed with higher
priority when creating an automatic error correction
system. Figure 4 shows a histogram of error cate-
gories. Again, we can observe a skewed distribu-
tion with a few error categories being very frequent
and many error categories being comparatively in-
frequent. The top five error categories are wrong
collocation/idiom/preposition (Wcip) with 7,312 in-
stances or 15.69% of all annotations, local redun-
dancies (Rloc) (6,390 instances, 13.71%), article or
determiner (ArtOrDet) (6,004 instances, 12.88%),
noun number (Nn) (3,955 instances, 8.49%), and
mechanics (Mec) (3,290 instances, 7.06%). These
top five error categories account for 57.83% of all er-
ror annotations. The next 5 categories are verb tense
(Vt) (3,288 instances, 7.06%) word form (Wform)

(SVA) (1,578 instances, 3.38%), other errors that
could not be grouped into any of the error categories
(1,532 instances, 3.29%), and Verb form (Vform)
(1,531, 3.29%). Together, the top 10 error cate-
gories account for 79.66% of all annotated errors.
A manual inspection showed that a large percentage
of the local redundancy errors involve articles that
are deemed redundant by the annotator and should
be deleted. These errors could also be considered
article or determiner errors. For the Wcip errors,
we observed that most Wcip errors are preposition
errors. This confirms that articles and prepositions
are the two most frequent error categories for EFL
learners (Leacock et al, 2010).
6 Related Work
In this section, we compare NUCLE with other
learner corpora. While there were almost no an-
notated learner corpora available for research pur-
poses until recently, non-annotated learner corpora
have been available for a while. Two examples are
the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE)
(Granger et al, 2002) and the Chinese Learner En-
glish Corpus (Gui and Yang., 2003)3. Rozovskaya
and Roth (2010) annotated a portion of each of these
two learner corpora with error categories and correc-
tions. However, with 63,000 words, the annotated
data is small compared to NUCLE.
3The Chinese Learner English Corpus contains annotations
for error types but does not include corrections for the errors.
29
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) (Nicholls,
2003) is possibly the largest annotated English
learner corpus. Unfortunately, to our knowledge,
the corpus is not freely available for research pur-
poses. A subset of the CLC was released in 2011
by Yannakoudakis et al (2011). The released data
set contains short essays written by students taking
the First Certificate in English (FCE) examination.
The data set was also used in the recent HOO 2012
shared task on preposition and determiner correction
(Dale et al, 2012). Comparing the essays in the FCE
data set and NUCLE, we observe that the essays in
the FCE data set are shorter than the essays in NU-
CLE and show a higher density of grammatical er-
rors. One reason for the higher number of errors (in
particular spelling errors) is most likely that the FCE
data was not collected from take-home assignments
where students have the chance to spell check their
writing before submission. But it could also mean
that the essays in FCE are from students with a lower
proficiency in English compared to NUCLE. With
regards to the annotation schema, the CLC annota-
tions include both the type of error (missing, unnec-
essary, replacement, form) and the part of speech.
As a result, the CLC tag set is large with 88 differ-
ent error categories, far more than the 27 error cate-
gories in NUCLE.
Finally, the HOO 2011 shared task (Dale and Kil-
garriff, 2011) released an annotated corpus of frag-
ments from academic papers written by non-native
speakers and published in a conference or work-
shop of the Association for Computational Linguis-
tics. The corpus uses the annotation schema from
the CLC. Comparing the data set with NUCLE, the
HOO 2011 data set is much smaller (about 20,000
words for training and testing, respectively) and rep-
resents a specific writing genre (NLP papers). The
NUCLE corpus is much larger and covers a broader
range of topics.
7 Conclusion
We have presented the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE), a large, annotated corpus of learner
English. The corpus contains over one million
words which are completely annotated with gram-
matical errors and corrections. The NUCLE corpus
is freely available for research purposes. We have
also reported an inter-annotator agreement study for
grammatical error correction. The study shows that
grammatical error correction is a difficult task, even
for humans. The error statistics from the NUCLE
corpus show that learner errors are generally sparse
and have a long-tail distribution.
