Abstract
The increasing flow of information be-
tween languages has led to a rise in the fre-
quency of non-native or loan words, where
terms of one language appear transliter-
ated in another. Dealing with such out
of vocabulary words is essential for suc-
cessful cross-lingual information retrieval.
For example, techniques such as stemming
should not be applied indiscriminately to
all words in a collection, and so before any
stemming, foreign words need to be iden-
tified. In this paper, we investigate three
approaches for the identification of foreign
words in Arabic text: lexicons, language
patterns, and n-grams and present that re-
sults show that lexicon-based approaches
outperform the other techniques.
1 Introduction
Arabic words are derived from roots having three,
four, or, in rare instances, five characters. The
derivation process consistently follows patterns
that are based on the three letter verb

?

?

	
? (/fa?ala/
to do)1. Each root word matches a base pattern.
Characters are added at the beginning, the mid-
dle, or end of the root, but the base characters that
match the pattern remain unchanged.
The pronunciation of Arabic characters is as-
sociated with short vowels; these are represented
by diacritics, and attached to other characters to
show how the characters should be pronounced.
An Arabic character can be pronounced in several
different ways. For example, the letter H
.
with the
1We represent phonetics using the International Pho-
netic Alphabet (http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/
ipachart.html)
diacritic Fatha H
.
is pronounced /ba/, with the dia-
critic Kasra H
.

is pronounced /bI/, and with having
the diacritic Damma H
.
is pronounced /bU/. Di-
acritics are not shown in general written Arabic,
and the reader must rely on the context to deter-
mine the implicit diacritics and therefore the pro-
nunciation of each word. For example, the word
I
.
?
	
X can represent I
.

?

	
X (/Dahaba/ = went), I
.

?

	
X
(/Dahab/ = gold).
Pure Arabic words follow restricted rules in
their construction to keep them short and easy
to pronounce. Their sounds usually follow the
CVCV pattern, where C stands for a consonant
and V stands for a Vowel. An Arabic word never
has two consecutive consonants nor four consecu-
tive vowels (Al-Shanti, 1996).
Foreign words are words that are borrowed from
other languages. Some are remodelled to con-
form with Arabic word paradigms, and become
part of the Arabic lexicon; others are transliterated
into Arabic as they are pronounced by different
Arabic speakers, with some segmental and vowel
changes. The latter are called Out-Of-Vocabulary
(OOV) words as they are not found in a standard
Arabic lexicon. Such OOV words are increas-
ingly common due to the inflow of information
from foreign sources, and include terms that are
either new and have yet to be translated into native
equivalents, or proper nouns that have had their
phonemes replaced by Arabic ones. Examples in-
clude words such as HQ 	?PA? /margrIt/ (Margaret)
or ??	JJ


? /linIks/ (Linux). This process often re-
sults in different Arabic spellings for the same
word.
Current Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR)
systems do not handle the problem of retriev-
ing the different versions of the same foreign
258
word (Abdelali et al, 2004), and instead typically
retrieve only the documents containing the same
spelling of the word as used in the query.
One solution to this problem has been used in
cross-lingual information retrieval, where OOV
words in the query are transliterated into their pos-
sible equivalents. Transliterating terms in English
queries into multiple Arabic equivalents using an
English-Arabic dictionary has been shown to have
a positive impact on retrieval results (Abduljaleel
and Larkey, 2003). However, we are aware of no
work on handling OOV terms in Arabic queries.
For this, proper identification of foreign words
is essential. Otherwise, query expansion for such
words is not likely to be effective: many Ara-
bic words could be wrongly expanded, resulting
in long queries with many false transliterations of
Arabic words. Furthermore, proper identification
of foreign words would be helpful because such
words could then be treated differently using tech-
niques such as approximate string matching (Zo-
bel and Dart, 1995).
In this paper, we examine possible techniques
to identify foreign words in Arabic text. In the
following sections we categorise and define for-
eign words in Arabic, and follow in section 2 with
a discussion of possible different approaches that
can identify them in Arabic text. In section 3 we
present an initial evaluation of these approaches,
and describe improvements in section 4 that we
then explore in a second experiment in section 5.
We discuss results in section 6 and finally con-
clude our work in section 7.
1.1 Foreign words in Arabic
Arabic has many foreign words, with varying lev-
els of assimilation into the language. Words bor-
rowed from other languages usually have different
style in writing and construction, and Arabic lin-
guists have drawn up rules to identify them. For
example, any root Arabic word that has four or
more characters should have one or more of the
?Dalaga? letters ( 	?, P, , 	?, ?, H
.
). Those that
have no such letters are considered foreign (Al-
Shanti, 1996). However, while such rules could
be useful for linguistic purposes, they have limited
application in Information Retrieval (IR); based on
rules, many foreign words that have long been ab-
sorbed into the language and are spelled consis-
tently would be considered to be OOV. From the
IR perspective, foreign words can be split into two

Table 1: Different spelling versions for the name
Milosevic
general categories: translated and transliterated.
Translated: These are foreign words that are
modified or remodelled to conform with Ara-
bic word paradigms; they are well assimi-
lated into Arabic, and are sometimes referred
to as Arabicised words (Aljlayl and Frieder,
2002). This process includes changes in the
structure of the borrowed word, including
segmental and vowel changes, and the addi-
tion, deletion, and modification of stress pat-
terns (Al-Qinal, 2002). This category of for-
eign words usually has a single spelling ver-
sion that is used consistently. Examples in-
clude words such as 	?AJ?
.
(/bUst?n/ = gar-
den), h
.
QK
.
(/bUrZ/ = tower), ?K


XP (/r?duU/ =
radio), and ??J
.
	
J

? (/qUnbula = bomb).
Transliterated: Words in this category are
transliterated into Arabic by replacing
phonemes with their nearest Arabic equiv-
alents. Although Arabic has a broad sound
system that contains most phonemes used in
other languages, not all phonemes have Ara-
bic equivalents. In practice, such phonemes
may be represented in different ways by dif-
ferent persons, resulting in several spelling
versions for the same foreign word. For
example, we observed 28 transliterated
versions for the name of the former Serbian
leader (Milosevic) in the TREC 2002 Arabic
collection; these are shown in Table 1.
Transliteration has become more common than
translation due to the need for instant access to
new foreign terms. It can take considerable time
for a new foreign term to be included in reference
259
dictionaries. However, users often need to imme-
diately use a particular term, and cannot wait un-
til a standard form of the word is created; news
agencies form an important category of such users.
This transliteration process often results in multi-
ple spellings in common usage.
1.2 Related work
In the context of information retrieval, most work
on foreign words in Arabic has been based on
transliteration, and carried out under machine
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval
(CLIR) tasks, where English queries are used to
search for Arabic documents, or vice versa. This
often involves the use of a bilingual dictionary to
translate queries and transliterate OOV words into
their equivalents in Arabic.
Expanding a foreign word to its possible vari-
ants in a query has been shown to increase the pre-
cision of search results (Abduljaleel and Larkey,
2003). However, OOV words in the query are
easily recognised based on English rules and an
English-Arabic dictionary: capitalised words are
marked as nouns, and the remaining words are
translated using the dictionary. Words not found in
the dictionary are marked as OOV and are translit-
erated into probable Arabic forms. In contrast, we
aim to identify foreign words as a within Arabic
text which is made difficult by the absence of such
easily perceptible difference.
Stalls and Knight (1998) describe research to
determine the original foreign word from its Ara-
bic version; this is known as back transliteration.
However, rather than using automatic methods to
identify foreign words, they used a list of 2 800
names to test the accuracy of the back translit-
eration algorithm. Of these, only 900 names
were successfully transliterated to their source
names. While this approach can be used to iden-
tify transliterated foreign words, its effectiveness
is not known on normal Arabic words as only
names were used to test the algorithm.
Jeong et al (1999) used statistical differ-
ences in syllable unigram and bigram patterns
between pure Korean words and foreign words
to identify foreign words in Korean documents.
This approach was later enhanced by Kang and
Choi (2002) to incorporate word segmentation.
A related area is language identification, where
statistics derived from a language model are used
to automatically identify languages (Dunning,
1994). Using N-gram counting produces good ac-
curacy for long strings with 50 or more charac-
ters, and moderately well with 10-character-long
strings. It is unclear how well this approach would
work on individual words with five characters on
average.
2 Identifying foreign words
We categorise three general approaches for recog-
nising foreign words in Arabic text:
Arabic lexicon
OOV words can be easily captured by checking
whether they exist in an Arabic lexicon. However,
the lexicon is unlikely to include all Arabic words,
while at the same time it could contain some for-
eign words. Moreover, this approach will identify
misspelled Arabic words as foreign.
Arabic patterns system
Arabic uses a pattern system to derive words
from their roots. Roots are three, four or some-
times five letters long. The reference pattern

?

?

	
?
(/fa?ala/ = to do) is often used to represent three-
letter root words. For example, the word


I

j

K
.
(/b? Ta/ = searched) can be represented by this pat-
tern through mapping K
.
to 

	
?, 

j to  ?, and


I
to

?.
Many stems can be generated from this root us-
ing standard patterns. For instance,

??

A

	
? (/f??Il/ =
doer) , and

?

?

	
?

K


(/yf?lU/ = is doing) are two dif-
ferent patterns that respectively represent the ac-
tive participle, and present tense verb from the pat-
tern

?

?

	
?. By placing the appropriate core letters
and adding additional letters in each pattern, we
can generate words such as


Ik

A

K
.
(/b??IT/ = re-
searcher), I j
.

K


(/yb?TU/ = does search) respec-
tively. New words can further accept prefixes and
suffixes.
We can recognise whether a word is an Ara-
bic or foreign word by reversing the process and
testing the different patterns. If, after all pos-
sible affixes have been removed, the remaining
stem matches an Arabic pattern, the word is likely
to be an Arabic word. For example, to check
whether the word


Ik

A

J
.

? 

? (/walb??IT/ = and the
researcher) is a foreign word, we first remove the
prefixes ? and ?  to get the stem


Ik

A

K
.
; we find
that this word matches the pattern

??

A

	
? ? it has
the same length, and the letter A is in the same po-
260
sition ? and conclude that it is therefore an Arabic
word. Note that we must perform this determina-
tion without relying on diacritics.
This approach is not perfect, as general Arabic
text does not include explicit diacritics; if parts of
a foreign word match a pattern, it will be marked
as being Arabic. Similarly, misspelled words may
be classified as foreign words if no matching pat-
tern is found.
N-gram approach
Transliterated foreign words exhibit construc-
tion patterns that are often different from Arabic
patterns. By counting the N-grams of a sample of
foreign words, a profile can be constructed to iden-
tify similar words. This approach has been used
in language identification, although it is reported
to have only moderate effectiveness in identifying
short strings (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994; Dunning,
1994).
2.1 Resources
For the lexicon approach, we used three lexicons:
the Khoja root lexicon (Khoja and Garside, 1999),
the Buckwalter Lexicon (Buckwalter, 2002), and
the Microsoft office 2003 lexicon (Microsoft Cor-
poration, 2002).
The Khoja stemmer has an associated com-
pressed language dictionary that contains well-
known roots. The stemmer strips prefixes and suf-
fixes and matches the remaining stem with a list of
Arabic patterns. If a match is found, the root is ex-
tracted and checked against the dictionary of root
words. If no entry is found, the word is considered
to be a non-Arabic word. We call this the Khoja
Lexicon Approach (KLA).
The Buckwalter morphological analyser is a
lexicon that uses three tables and an algorithm to
check possible affixes. The algorithm checks a
word and analyses its possible prefixes and suf-
fixes to determine possible segmentation for an
Arabic word. If the algorithm fails to find any
possible segmentation, the word is considered not
found in the lexicon. We name this approach the
Buckwalter Lexicon Approach (BLA).
The Microsoft office lexicon is the one used in
the Microsoft Office 2003 spell-checker. We test
whether an Arabic word is found in this lexicon,
and classify those that are not in the lexicon to be
foreign words. We call this approach the Office
Lexicon Approach (OLA).

Table 2: Patterns added to the Khoja modified
stemmer to implement the KPA approach
To use Arabic patterns, we modified the Khoja
stemmer to check whether there is a match be-
tween a word and a list of patterns after stemming
without further checking against the root dictio-
nary. If there is no match, the word is considered
a foreign word. This approach is similar to the ap-
proach used by Taghva et al (2005). We adopted
the patterns of the Khoja stemmer and added 37
patterns compiled from Arabic grammar books,
these are shown in Table 2. We call these ap-
proaches the Khoja Pattern Approach (KPA), and
Modified Khoja Pattern Approach (MKP) respec-
tively. A word is also considered to be an Arabic
word if the remaining stem has three or fewer let-
ters.
We evaluate the effectiveness of the n-gram
method in two ways. First, we extend the n-gram
text categorisation method presented by Cavnar
and Trenkle (1994). The method uses language
profiles where, for each language, all n-grams that
occur in a training corpus are sorted in order of
decreasing frequency of occurrence, for n ranging
from 1 to 5. To classify a text t, we build its n-
gram frequency profile, and compute the distance
between each n-gram in the text and in each lan-
guage profile lj . The total distance is computed by
summing up all differences between the position
of the n-gram in the text profile and the position of
the same n-gram in the language profile:
Dj =
Ni
?
i=1
| rank(ti, text)Ni
? rank(ti, lj)Nj
|
where Dj is the total distance between a text t with
Ni n-grams, and a language profile lj with Nj n-
grams; and rank is the position of the n-gram in
the frequency-sorted list of all n-grams for either
the text or language profile.
In our work, we build two language profiles, one
261
for native Arabic words and another for foreign
words. We compare the n-grams in each word in
our list against these two profiles. If the total dis-
tance between the word and the foreign words pro-
file is smaller than the total distance between the
word and the Arabic words profile, then it is clas-
sified as a foreign word. As the two language pro-
files are not in same size, we compute the relative
position of each n-gram by dividing its position in
the list by the number of the n-grams in the lan-
guage profile. We call this approach the n-gram
approach (NGR).
We also tried a simpler approach based on the
construction of two trigram models: one from
Arabic words, and another from foreign words.
The probability that a string is a foreign word is
determined by comparing the frequency of its tri-
grams with each language model. A word is con-
sidered foreign if the sum of the relative frequency
of its trigrams in the foreign words profile is higher
than the sum of the relative frequency of its tri-
grams in the Arabic words profile. We call this
approach trigram (TRG).
3 Training Experiments
In this section, we describe how we formed a
development data set using Arabic text from the
Web, and how we evaluated and improved tech-
niques for identification of foreign words.
3.1 Data
To form our development data set, we crawled the
Arabic web sites of the Al-Jazeera news channel1,
the Al-Anwar2 and El-Akhbar3 newspapers. A list
of 285 482 Arabic words was extracted. After re-
moving Arabic stop words such as pronouns and
prepositions, the list had 246 281 Arabic words
with 25 492 unique words.
In the absence of diacritics, we decided to re-
move words with three or fewer characters, as
these words could be interpreted as being either
Arabic or foreign in different situations. For ex-
ample, the word ?


G
.
(/bi/) could be interpreted as
the Arabic word meaning ?in me?, or the English
letter B. After this step, 24 218 unique words re-
mained.
We examined these words and categorised each
of them either as Arabic word (AW), or a translit-
1http://www.aljazeera.net
2http://www.alanwar.com
3http://www.elkhabar.com
erated foreign word (FW). We also had to clas-
sify some terms as misspelled Arabic word (MW).
We used the Microsoft Office spell-checker as a
first-pass filter to identify misspelled words, and
then manually inspected each word to identify any
that were actually correct; the spell-checker fails
to recognise some Arabic words, especially those
with some complex affixes. The list also had some
local Arabic dialect spellings that we chose to
classify as misspelled.
The final list had three categories: 22 295 cor-
rect Arabic words, 1 218 foreign words and 705
misspelled words.
To build language models for the trigram
approaches (NRG and TRG), we used the
TREC 2001 Arabic collection (Gey and Oard,
2001). We manually selected 3 046 foreign words
out of the OOV words extracted from the col-
lection using the Microsoft office spell-checker.
These foreign words are transliterated foreign
words. We built the Arabic language model us-
ing 100 000 words extracted from the TREC col-
lection using the same spell-checker. However, we
excluded any word that could be a proper noun, to
avoid involving foreign words. We used an algo-
rithm to exclude any word that does not accept the
suffix haa ( ?), as transliterated proper nouns can
not accept Arabic affixes.
3.2 Evaluation
We measure the accuracy of each approach by ex-
amining the number of foreign words correctly
identified, and the number of incorrect classifica-
tions. The precision of each approach is calculated
as the ratio of correctly identified foreign words
to the total number of words identified as foreign
The latter could be correct or misspelled Arabic
words identified as foreign plus the actual foreign
words identified. The recall is calculated as the
ratio of correctly identified foreign words to the
number of words marked manually as foreign. Al-
though there is generally a compromise between
precision and recall, we consider precision to be
more important, since incorrectly classifying Ara-
bic words as foreign would be more likely to harm
general retrieval performance. The left-hand side
of Table 3 shows the results of our experiments.
We have included the MW results to illustrate the
effects of misspelled words on each approach

(NGR) has the highest precision, while the

Table 3: Identification of foreign words: initial results (left) and results after improvements (right)
lexicon-based OLA approach gives the highest re-
call. The pattern approaches (KPA) and (MKP)
perform well compared to the combination of pat-
terns and the root lexicon (KLA), although the
latter produces higher recall. There is a slight
improvement in precision when adding more pat-
terns, but recall is sightly reduced. The KLA ap-
proach produces the poorest precision, but has bet-
ter recall rate than the NGR approach.
The results show that many Arabic native words
are mistakenly caught in the foreign words net.
Our intention is to handle foreign words differ-
ently from Arabic native words. Our approach
is based on normalising the different forms of the
same foreign word to one form at the index level
rather than expanding the foreign word to its possi-
ble variants at the query level. Retrieval precision
will be negatively affected by incorrect classifica-
tion of native and foreign words. Consequently,
we consider that keeping the proportion of false
positives ? correct Arabic words identified as for-
eign (precision) ? low to be more important than
correctly identifying a higher number of foreign
words (recall).
Some of the Arabic words categorised as for-
eign are in fact misspelled; we believe that these
have limited effect on retrieval precision, and there
is limited value in identifying such words in a
query unless the retrieval system incorporates a
correction process.
4 Enhanced rules
To reduce the false identification rate of foreign
words, we analysed the lists of foreign words, cor-
rect Arabic words identified as foreign, and Arabic
misspelled words identified as foreign. We noticed
that some Arabic characters rarely exist in translit-
erated foreign words, and used these to separate
Arabic words ? correctly or incorrectly spelled

Table 4: Frequency of Arabic letters in a sample
of 3 046 foreign words
? from true foreign words. Table 4 shows the
count of each character in the sample of 3 046 for-
eign words; foreign words tend to have vowels in-
serted between consonants to maintain the CVCV
paradigm. We also noticed that most of translit-
erated foreign words do not start with the definite
article ? , or end with the Taa Marbuta ?. Foreign
words also rarely end with two Arabic suffixes.
We also noticed that lexicon based approaches
fail to recognise some correct Arabic words for the
following reasons:
? Words with the letter  (Alef) with or with-
out the diacritics Hamza (

, 

), or the diacritic
Madda (
?
) are not recognised as correct in
many cases. Many words are also categorised
incorrectly if the Hamza is wrongly placed
above or below the initial Alef or the Madda
is absent. In modern Arabic text, the Alef of-
ten appears without the Hamza diacritic and
263
the Madda is sometimes dropped.
? Correct Arabic words are not recognised with
particular suffixes. For example, words that
have the object suffix, such as the suffix A?
in A??	K????K


(/yU?alImunakaha/ = they teach
it to you).
? Some Arabic words are compound words,
written attached to each other most of the
time. For example, compound nouns such as
PXA

?? YJ
.
? (/?bdulqadIr/), although composed
of two words that are individually identi-
fied as being correct, are flagged as incorrect
when combined.
? Some common typographical shortcuts result
in words being written without white space
between them. Where a character that always
terminates a word (for example ? ) is found
in the apparent middle of a word, it is clear
that this problem has occurred.
From these observations, we constructed the
following rules. Whenever one of the following
conditions is met, a word is not classified as for-
eign:
1. the word contains any of the Arabic charac-
ters:

?, Z,
	
X, h, ?,

?,

, 

,
?
,
	
?,
	
?, ?,

?;
2. the word starts with the definite article ( ? );
3. the word has more than one Arabic suffix
(pronouns attached at the end of the word);
4. the word has no vowels between the second
and penultimate character (inclusive); or
5. the word contains one of the strings: ?, ?,
Z,  , ?AK


, ?P, ?
	
P, ?X, ?
	
X, ??, ?, and when
split into two parts at the first character of any
sequence, the first part is three characters or
longer, and the second part is four characters
or longer.
The right-hand side of Table 3 shows the im-
provements achieved using these rules. It can
be seen that they have a large positive impact.
Overall, OLA performs the best, with precision
at 69% and recall at 71%. Figure 1 shows
the precision obtained before and after applying
these rules. Improvement is consistent across
all approaches, with an increase in precision be-
tween 10% and 25%.

5 Verification Experiments
To verify our results, we used another data set
of similar size to the first to verify our approach.
We collected a list of 23 466 unique words from
the Dar-al-Hayat newspaper4. Words, and classi-
fied and marked words in the same way as for the
first data set (described in Section 3.1). We de-
termined this new set to comprise 22 800 Arabic
words (AW), 536 Foreign words (FW), and 130
Misspelled words (MW). Table 5 shows the initial
results and improvements using the enhanced rules
obtained by each approach using this data set.
The results on this unseen data are relatively
consistent with the previous experiment, but pre-
cision in this sample is expectedly lower.
6 Discussion
We have seen that foreign words are not easily
recognised in Arabic text, and a large number of
Arabic words are affected when we try to exclude
foreign words.
We found the lexicon approach to be the best
in identifying foreign words. However, current
lexicons are relatively small, and the variety of
Arabic inflection makes it very difficult to include
all correct word forms. Furthermore, current lex-
icons include many foreign words; for example
when using OLA approach, 1 017 foreign words
out of 1 218 are OOV, indicating that about 200
foreign words are present in that lexicon. The
pattern approach is more efficient but the lack
of diacritics in general written Arabic makes it
very difficult to precisely match a pattern with a

word, resulting in many foreign words being in-
correctly identified as Arabic. Passing the list of
all 3 046 manually judged foreign words to the
pattern approach, some 2 017 words of this list
were correctly judged as foreign, and about one
third (1 029) were incorrectly judged to be Ara-
bic. The n-gram method produced reasonable pre-
cision compared to the lexicon-based methods. In
contrast, TRG had the worst results. This could
be due to the limited size of the training corpus.
However, we expect that improvements to this ap-
proach will remain limited due to the fact that
many Arabic and foreign words share the same
trigrams. It is clear that all the approaches are im-
proved dramatically when applying the enhance-
ment rules. The improvements of the NGR wasn?t
as equal as other approaches. This is because some
of the rules are implicitly applied within the n-
gram approach. The lack of diacritics also makes
it very difficult to distinguish between certain for-
eign and Arabic words. For example, without dia-
critics, the word 	?

two cases, but only context or diacritics can make

7 Conclusion
Identifying foreign words in Arabic text is an im-
portant problem for cross-lingual information re-
trieval, since commonly-used techniques such as
stemming should not be applied indiscriminately
to all words in a collection.
We have presented three approaches for identi-
fying foreign words in Arabic text: lexicons, pat-
terns, and n-grams. We have presented results
that show that the lexicon approach outperforms
the other approaches, and have described improve-
ments to minimise the false identification of for-
eign words. These rules result in improved preci-
sion, but have a small negative impact on recall.
Overall, the results are relatively low for practical
applications, and more work is needed to deal with
this problem. As foreign words are characterised
by having different versions, an algorithm that col-
lapse those versions to one form could be useful
in identifying foreign words. We are presently ex-
ploring algorithms to normalise foreign words in
Arabic text. This will allow us to identify nor-
malised forms for foreign words and use a single
consistent version for indexing and retrieval.
