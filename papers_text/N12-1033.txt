Abstract
We present an approach to automatically re-
cover hidden attributes of scientific articles,
such as whether the author is a native English
speaker, whether the author is a male or a fe-
male, and whether the paper was published in
a conference or workshop proceedings. We
train classifiers to predict these attributes in
computational linguistics papers. The classi-
fiers perform well in this challenging domain,
identifying non-native writing with 95% accu-
racy (over a baseline of 67%). We show the
benefits of using syntactic features in stylom-
etry; syntax leads to significant improvements
over bag-of-words models on all three tasks,
achieving 10% to 25% relative error reduction.
We give a detailed analysis of which words
and syntax most predict a particular attribute,
and we show a strong correlation between our
predictions and a paper?s number of citations.
1 Introduction
Stylometry aims to recover useful attributes of doc-
uments from the style of the writing. In some do-
mains, statistical techniques have successfully de-
duced author identity (Mosteller and Wallace, 1984),
gender (Koppel et al, 2003), native language (Kop-
pel et al, 2005), and even whether an author has de-
mentia (Le et al, 2011). Stylometric analysis is im-
portant to marketers, analysts and social scientists
because it provides demographic data directly from
raw text. There has been growing interest in apply-
ing stylometry to the content generated by users of
Internet applications, e.g., detecting author ethnic-
ity in social media (Eisenstein et al, 2011; Rao et

Stylometric Analysis of Scientific Articles
Abstract
We present an approach to automatically re-
cover hidden attributes of scientific articles,
such as whether the author is a native En-
glish speaker. We train classifiers to predict
these attributes in computational linguistics
papers. The classifiers perform well in this
challenging domain, identifying non-native
writing with 95% accuracy (over a baseline
of 67%), and outperforming reasonable base-
lines on two other difficult tasks. We show the
benefits of using syntactic features in stylom-
etry; syntax leads to significant improvements
over bag-of-words models on all three tasks,
achieving 10% to 25% relative error reduction.
We give an insightful analysis of which words
and syntax most predict a particular attribute,
and we show a strong correlation between our
predictions and a paper?s number of citations.
1 Introduction
Stylometry aims to recover useful attributes of doc-
uments from the style of their writing. In some
domains, statistical techniques have successfully
deduced author identities (Mosteller and Wallace,
1984), gender (Koppel et al, 2003), native language
(Koppel et al, 2005), and even whether an author
has dementia (Le et al, 2011). Stylometric analysis
is important to marketers, analysts and social scien-
tists because it provides demographic data directly
from raw text. There has been growing interest in
applying stylometry in Web 2.0 applications, e.g.,
detecting the ethnicity of Twitter users (Eisenstein
et al, 2011; Rao et al, 2011), or whether a person is
writing deceptive online reviews (Ott et al, 2011).
We evaluate stylometric techniques in the novel
domain of scientific writing. Science is a diffi-
cult domain; authors are compelled, often explic-
itly by reviewers/submission guidelines, to comply

Moreover, topical clues are less salient than in do-
mains like social media. Yet science is more than
just a good challenge for stylometry; it is an impor-
tant area in itself. Systems for scientific stylometry
would give sociologists new tools for analyzing aca-
demic communities, and new ways to resolve the na-
ture of collaboration in specific articles (Johri et al,
2011). Authors might also use these tools, e.g. to
help ensure a consistent style in multi-authored pa-
pers (Glover and Hirst, 1995). Our work includes:
New Stylometric Tasks: We predict whether a
paper is written: (1) by a native or non-native En-
glish speaker, (2) by a male or female, and (3) in the
style of a conference or a workshop paper. The latter
is a novel stylometric and bibliometric prediction.
New Stylometric Features: We show the value
of syntactic features for stylometry. Among others,
we describe tree substitution grammar fragments,

TSG fragments are interpretable, efficient, and par-

a common infrastructure. In addition to contrasting
different feature types, we also compare different

online reviews (Ott et al, 2011).
We evaluate stylometric techniques in the novel
domain of scientific writing. Science is a difficult
domain; authors are encouraged, often explicitly
by reviewers/submission-guidelines, to comply with
normative practices in style, spelling and grammar.
Moreover, topical clues are less salient than in do-
mains like social media. Success in this challenging
domain can bring us closer to correctly analyzing
the huge volumes of online text that are currently
unmarked for useful author attributes such as gender
and native-language.
Yet science is more than just a good stepping-
stone for stylometry; it is an important area in itself.
Systems for scientific stylometry would give sociol-
ogists new tools for analyzing academic communi-
ties, and new ways to resolve the nature of collab-
oration in specific articles (Johri et al, 2011). Au-
thors might also use these tools, e.g., to help ensure
a consistent style in multi-authored papers (Glover
and Hirst, 1995), or to determine sections of a paper
needing revision.

The contributions of our paper include:
New Stylometric Tasks: We predict whether
a paper is written: (1) by a native or non-native
speaker, (2) by a male or female, and (3) in the style
of a conference or workshop paper. The latter is a
fully novel stylometric and bibliometric prediction.
New Stylometric Features: We show the value
of syntactic features for stylometry. Among others,
we describe tree substitution grammar fragments,
which have not previously been used in stylometry.
TSG fragments are interpretable, efficient, and par-
ticularly effective for detecting non-native writing.
While recent studies have mostly evaluated sin-
gle prediction tasks, we compare different strategies
across different tasks on a common dataset and with
a common infrastructure. In addition to contrasting
different feature types, we compare different train-
ing strategies, exploring ways to make use of train-
ing instances with label uncertainty.
We also provide a detailed analysis that is inter-
esting from a sociolinguistic standpoint. Precisely
what words distinguish non-native writing? How
does the syntax of female authors differ from males?
What are the hallmarks of top-tier papers? Finally,
we identify some strong correlations between our
predictions and a paper?s citation count, even when
controlling for paper venue and origin.
2 Related Work
Bibliometrics is the empirical analysis of scholarly
literature; citation analysis is a well-known bib-
liometric approach for ranking authors and papers
(Borgman and Furner, 2001). Bibliometry and sty-
lometry can share goals but differ in techniques.
For example, in a work questioning the blindness
of double-blind reviewing, Hill and Provost (2003)
predict author identities. They ignore the article
body and instead consider (a) potential self-citations
and (b) similarity between the article?s citation list
and the citation lists of known papers. Radev et al
(2009a) perform a bibliometric analysis of compu-
tational linguistics. Teufel and Moens (2002) and
Qazvinian and Radev (2008) summarize scientific
articles, the latter by automatically finding and fil-
tering sentences in other papers that cite the target
article.
Our system does not consider citations; it is most
similar to work that uses raw article text. Hall et
al. (2008) build per-year topic models over scientific
literature to track the evolution of scientific ideas.
Gerrish and Blei (2010) assess the influence of indi-
vidual articles by modeling their impact on the con-
tent of future papers. Yogatama et al (2011) pre-
dict whether a paper will be cited based on both its
content and its meta-data such as author names and
publication venues. Johri et al (2011) use per-author
topic models to assess the nature of collaboration in
a particular article (e.g., apprenticeship or synergy).
One of the tasks in Sarawgi et al (2011) concerned
predicting gender in scientific writing, but they use a
corpus of only ten ?highly established? authors and
make the prediction using twenty papers for each.
Finally, Dale and Kilgarriff (2010) initiated a shared
task on automatic editing of scientific papers written
by non-native speakers, with the objective of devel-
oping ?tools which can help non-native speakers of
English (NNSs) (and maybe some native ones) write
academic English prose of the kind that helps a pa-
per get accepted.?
Lexical and pragmatic choices in academic writ-
ing have also been analyzed within the applied lin-
guistics community (Myers, 1989; Vassileva, 1998).
3 ACL Dataset and Preprocessing
We use papers from the ACL Anthology Network
(Radev et al, 2009b, Release 2011) and exploit its
manually-curated meta-data such as normalized au-
thor names, affiliations (including country, avail-
able up to 2009), and citation counts. We con-
vert each PDF to text1 but remove text before the
Abstract (to anonymize) and after the Acknowledg-
ments/References headings. We split the text into
sentences2 and filter any documents with fewer than
100 (this removes some short/demo papers, mal-
converted PDFs, etc. ? about 23% of the 13K pa-
pers with affiliation information). In case the text
was garbled, we then filtered the first 3 lines from
every file and any line with an ?@? symbol (which
might be part of an affiliation). We remove foot-
ers like Proceedings of ..., table/figure captions, and
any lines with non-ASCII characters (e.g. math
equations). Papers are then parsed via the Berke-

Training sets always comprise papers from 2001-
2007, while test sets are created by randomly shuf-
fling the 2008-2009 portion and then dividing it into
development/test sets. We also use papers from
1990-2000 for experiments in ?7.3 and ?7.4.
4 Stylometric Tasks
Each task has both a Strict training set, using only
the data for which we are most confident in the la-
bels (as described below), and a Lenient set, which
forcibly assigns every paper in the training period
to some class (Table 1). All test papers are anno-
tated using a Strict rule. While our approaches for
automatically-assigning labels can be coarse, they
allow us to scale our analysis to a realistic cross-
section of academic papers, letting us discover some
interesting trends.
4.1 NativeL: Native vs. Non-Native English
We introduce the task of predicting whether a sci-
entific paper is written by a native English speaker
(NES) or non-native speaker (NNS). Prior work has
mostly made this prediction in learner corpora (Kop-
pel et al, 2005; Tsur and Rappoport, 2007; Wong
and Dras, 2011), although there have been attempts
in elicited speech transcripts (Tomokiyo and Jones,
2001) and e-mail (Estival et al, 2007). There has
also been a large body of work on correcting er-
rors in non-native writing, with a specific focus on
difficulties in preposition and article usage (Han et
al., 2006; Chodorow et al, 2007; Felice and Pul-
man, 2007; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Gamon,
2010).
We annotate papers using two pieces of associated
meta-data: (1) author first names and (2) countries
of affiliation. We manually marked each country for
whether English is predominantly spoken there. We
then built a list of common first names of English
speakers via the top 150 male and female names
from the U.S. census.3 If the first author of a pa-
per has an English first name and English-speaking-
country affiliation, we mark as NES.4 If none of the
authors have an English first name nor an English-
speaking-country affiliation, we mark as NNS. We
use this rule to label our development and test data,
as well as our Strict training set. For Lenient train-
ing, we decide based solely on whether the first au-
thor is from an English-speaking country.
4.2 Venue: Top-Tier vs. Workshop
This novel task aims to distinguish top-tier papers
from those at workshops, based on style. We use
the annual meeting of the ACL as our canonical top-
tier venue. For evaluation and Strict training, we la-
bel all main-session ACL papers as top-tier, and all
workshop papers as workshop. For Lenient training,
we assign all conferences (LREC, Coling, EMNLP,
etc.) to be top-tier except for their non-main-session
papers, which we label as workshop.
4.3 Gender: Male vs. Female
Because we are classifying an international set of
authors, U.S. census names (the usual source of
gender ground-truth) provide incomplete informa-
tion. We therefore use the data of Bergsma and Lin
(2006).5 This data has been widely used in corefer-
ence resolution but never in stylometry. Each line
in the data lists how often a noun co-occurs with
male, female, neutral and plural pronouns; this is
commonly taken as an approximation of the true
gender distribution. E.g., ?bill clinton? is 98% male
(in 8344 instances) while ?elsie wayne? is 100% fe-
male (in 23). The data also has aggregate counts
over all nouns with the same first token, e.g., ?elsie
...? is 94% female (in 255 instances). For Strict
training/evaluation, we label papers with the fol-
lowing rule based on the first author?s first name:
3
www.census.gov/genealogy/names/names_files.
html We also manually added common nicknames for these,
e.g. Rob for Robert, Chris for Christopher, Dan for Daniel, etc.
4Of course, assuming the first author writes each paper is
imperfect. In fact, for some native/non-native collaborations,
our system ultimately predicts the 2nd (non-native) author to be
the main writer; in one case we confirmed the accuracy of this
prediction by personal communication with the authors.

if the name has an aggregate count >30 and fe-
male probability >0.85, label as female; otherwise
if the aggregate count is >30 and male probabil-
ity >0.85, label male. This rule captures many of
ACL?s unambiguously-gendered names, both male
(Nathanael, Jens, Hiroyuki) and female (Widad,
Yael, Sunita). For Lenient training, we assign all
papers based only on whether the male or female
probability for the first author is higher. While po-
tentially noisy, there is precedent for assigning a sin-
gle gender to papers ?co-authored by researchers of
mixed gender? (Sarawgi et al, 2011).
5 Models and Training Strategies
Model: We take a discriminative approach to sty-
lometry, representing articles as feature vectors (?6)
and classifying them using a linear, L2-regularized
SVM, trained via LIBLINEAR (Fan et al, 2008).
SVMs are state-of-the-art and have been used pre-
viously in stylometry (Koppel et al, 2005).
Strategy: We test whether it?s better to train with
a smaller, more accurate Strict set, or a larger but
noisier Lenient set. We also explore a third strategy,
motivated by work in learning from noisy web im-
ages (Bergamo and Torresani, 2010), in which we
fix the Strict labels, but also include the remaining
examples as unlabeled instances. We then optimize
a Transductive SVM, solving an optimization prob-
lem where we not only choose the feature weights,
but also labels for unlabeled training points. Like
a regular SVM, the goal is to maximize the margin
between the positive and negative vectors, but now
the vectors have both fixed and imputed labels. We
optimize using Joachims (1999)?s software. While
the classifier is trained using a transductive strategy,
it is still tested inductively, i.e., on unseen data.
6 Stylometric Features
Koppel et al (2003) describes a range of features
that have been used in stylometry, ranging from
early manual selection of potentially discriminative
words, to approaches based on automated text cat-
egorization (Sebastiani, 2002). We use the follow-
ing three feature classes; the particular features were
chosen based on development experiments.
6.1 Bow Features
A variety of ?discouraging results? in the text cate-
gorization literature have shown that simple bag-of-
words (Bow) representations usually perform better
than ?more sophisticated? ones (e.g. using syntax)
(Sebastiani, 2002). This was also observed in sen-
timent classification (Pang et al, 2002). One key
aim of our research is to see whether this is true of
scientific stylometry. Our Bow representation uses
a feature for each unique lower-case word-type in
an article. We also preprocess papers by making all
digits ?0?. Normalizing digits and filtering capital-
ized words helps ensure citations and named-entities
are excluded from our features. The feature value is
the log-count of how often the corresponding word
occurs in the document.
6.2 Style Features
While text categorization relies on keywords, sty-
lometry focuses on topic-independent measures like
function word frequency (Mosteller and Wallace,
1984), sentence length (Yule, 1939), and PoS (Hirst
and Feiguina, 2007). We define a style-word to be:
(1) punctuation, (2) a stopword, or (3) a Latin abbre-
viation.6 We create Style features for all unigrams
and bigrams, replacing non-style-words separately
with both PoS-tags and spelling signatures.7 Each
feature is an N-gram, the value is its log-count in the
article. We also include stylistic meta-features such
as mean-words-per-sentence and mean-word-length.
6.3 Syntax Features
Unlike recent work using generative PCFGs (Ragha-
van et al, 2010; Sarawgi et al, 2011), we use syntax
directly as features in discriminative models, which
can easily incorporate arbitrary and overlapping syn-
tactic clues. For example, we will see that one indi-
cator of native text is the use of certain determin-
ers as stand-alone noun phrases (NPs), like this in
Figure 2. This contrasts with a proposed non-native
phrase, ?this/DT growing/VBG area/NN,? where this
instead modifies a noun. The Bow features are
clearly unhelpful: this occurs in both cases. The
6The stopword list is the standard set of 524 SMART-system
stopwords (following Tomokiyo and Jones (2001)). Latin ab-
breviations are i.e., e.g., etc., c.f., et or al.

Figure 2: Motivating deeper syntactic features: The
shaded TSG fragment indicates native English, but is not
directly encoded in Bow, Style, nor standard CFG-rules.
Style features are likewise unhelpful; this-VBG also
occurs in both cases. We need the deeper knowledge
that a specific determiner is used as a complete NP.
We evaluate three feature types that aim to cap-
ture such knowledge. In each case, we aggregate the
feature counts over all the parse trees constituting a
document. The feature value is the log-count of how
often each feature occurs. To remove content infor-
mation from the features, we preprocess the parse
tree terminals: all non-style-word terminals are re-
placed with their spelling signature (see ?6.2).
CFG Rules: We include a feature for every unique,
single-level context-free-grammar (CFG) rule appli-
cation in a paper (following Baayen et al (1996),
Gamon (2004), Hirst and Feiguina (2007), Wong
and Dras (2011)). The Figure 2 tree would have
features: NP?PRP, NP?DT, DT?this, etc. Such fea-
tures do capture that a determiner was used as an NP,
but they do not jointly encode which determiner was
used. This is an important omission; we?ll see that
other determiners acting as stand-alone NPs indicate
non-native writing (e.g., the word that, see ?7.2).
TSG Fragments: A tree-substitution grammar is a
generalization of CFGs that allow rewriting to tree
fragments rather than sequences of non-terminals
(Joshi and Schabes, 1997). Figure 2 gives the exam-
ple NP?(DT this). This fragment captures both the
identity of the determiner and its syntactic function
as an NP, as desired. Efficient Bayesian procedures
have recently been developed that enable the train-
ing of large-scale probabilistic TSG grammars (Post
and Gildea, 2009; Cohn et al, 2010).
While TSGs have not been used previously in sty-
lometry, Post (2011) uses them to predict sentence
grammaticality (i.e. detecting pseudo-sentences fol-
lowing Okanohara and Tsujii (2007) and Cherry and
Quirk (2008)). We use Post?s TSG training settings
and his public code.8 We parse with the TSG gram-
mar and extract the fragments as features. We also
follow Post by having features for aggregate TSG
statistics, e.g., how many fragments are of a given
size, tree-depth, etc. These syntactic meta-features
are somewhat similar to the manually-defined stylo-
metric features of Stamatatos et al (2001).
C&J Reranking Features: We also extracted the
reranking features of Charniak and Johnson (2005).
These features were hand-crafted for reranking the
output of a parser, but have recently been used for
other NLP tasks (Post, 2011; Wong and Dras, 2011).
They include lexicalized features for sub-trees and
head-to-head dependencies, and aggregate features
for conjunct parallelism and the degree of right-
branching. We get the features using another script
from Post.9 While TSG fragments tile a parse tree
into a few useful fragments, C&J features can pro-
duce thousands of features per sentence, and are thus
much more computationally-demanding.
7 Experiments and Results
We take the minority class as the positive class:
NES for NativeL, top-tier for Venue and female for
Gender, and calculate the precision/recall of these
classes. We tune three hyperparameters for F1-
score on development data: (1) the SVM regular-
ization parameter, (2) the threshold for classifying
an instance as positive (using the signed hyperplane-
distance as the score), and (3) for transductive train-
ing (?5), the fraction of unlabeled data to label as
positive. Statistical significance on held-out test data
is assessed with McNemar?s test, p<0.05. For F1-
score, we use the following reasonable Baseline: we
label all instances with the label of the minority class
(achieving 100% recall but low precision).
7.1 Selection of Syntax and Training Strategy
Development experiments showed that using all fea-
tures, Bow+Style+Syntax, works best on all tasks,
but there was no benefit in combining different

Syntax features. We also found no gain from trans-
ductive training, but greater cost, with more hyper-
parameter tuning and a slower SVM solver. The
best Syntax features depend on the task (Table 2).
Whether Strict or Lenient training: TSG was best
for NativeL, C&J was best for Venue, and CFG was
best for Gender. These trends continue on test data,
where TSG exceeds CFG (91.6% vs. 91.2%). For
the training strategy, Strict was best on NativeL and
Gender, while Lenient was best on Venue (Table 2).
This latter result is interesting: recall that for Venue,
Lenient training considers all conferences to be top-
tier, but evaluation is just on detecting ACL papers.
We suggest some reasons for this below, highlight-
ing some general features of conference papers that
extend beyond particular venues.
For the remainder of experiments on each task,
we fix the syntactic features and training strategy to
those that performed best on development data.
7.2 Test Results and Feature Analysis
Gender remains the most difficult task on test data,
but our F1 still substantially outperforms the base-
line (Table 3). Results on NativeL are particu-
larly impressive; in terms of accuracy, we classify
94.6% of test articles correctly (the majority-class
baseline is 66.9%). Regarding features, just using
Style+Syntax always works better than using Bow.
Combining all features always works better still.
The gains of Bow+Style+Syntax over vanilla Bow are
statistically significant in each case.
We also highlight important individual features:
NativeL: Table 4 gives Bow and Style features
for NativeL. Some reflect differences in common

data: Including style and syntactic features is superior to
standard Bow features in all cases.
native/non-native topics; e.g., ?probabilities? pre-
dicts native while ?morphological? predicts non-
native. Several features, like ?obtained?, indicate L1
interference; i.e., many non-natives have a cognate
for obtain in their native language and thus adopt the
English word. As an example, the word obtained
occurs 3.7 times per paper from Spanish-speaking
areas (cognate obtenir) versus once per native paper
and 0.8 times per German-authored paper.
Natives also prefer certain abbreviations (e.g.
?e.g.?) while non-natives prefer others (?i.e.?, ?c.f.?,
?etc.?). Exotic punctuation also suggests native text:
the semi-colon, exclamation and question mark all
predict NES. Note this also varies by region; semi-
colons are most popular in NES countries but papers
from Israel and Italy are close behind.
Table 5 gives highly-weighted TSG features for
predicting NativeL. Note the determiner-as-NP us-
age described earlier (? 6.3): these, this and each
predict native when used as an NP; that-as-an-NP
predicts non-native. Furthermore, while not all na-
tive speakers use a comma before a conjunction in
a list, it?s nevertheless a good flag for native writ-
ing (?NP?NP, NP, (CC and) NP?). In terms of non-
native syntax, the passive voice is more common
(?VP?(VBZ is) VP? and ?VP?VBN (PP (IN as) NP)?).
We also looked for features involving determiners
since correct determiner usage is a common diffi-
culty for non-native speakers. We found cases where
determiners were missing where natives might have
used one (?NP?JJ JJ NN?), but also those where a de-
terminer might be optional and skipped by a native
speaker (?NP?(DT the) NN NNS?). Note that Table 5

examples are based on actual usage in ACL papers.
We also found that complex NPs were more asso-
ciated with native text. Features such as ?NP?DT JJ
NN NN NN?, and ?NP?DT NN NN NNS? predict native
writing.
Non-natives also rely more on boilerplate. For
example, the exact phrase ?The/This paper is orga-
nized as follows? occurs 3 times as often in non-
native compared to native text (in 7.5% of all non-
native papers). Sentence re-use is only indirectly
captured by our features; it would be interesting to
encode flags for it directly.
In general, we found very few highly-weighted
features that pinpoint ?ungrammatical? non-native
writing (the feature ?associated to? in Table 4 is a
rare example). Our classifiers largely detect non-
native writing on a stylistic rather than grammatical
basis.
Venue: Table 6 provides important Bow and Style
features for the Venue task (syntactic features omit-
ted due to space). While some features are topical
(e.g. ?biomedical?), the table gives a blueprint for
writing a solid main-conference paper. That is, good
papers often have an explicit probability model (or
algorithm), experimental baselines, error analysis,

and statistical significance checking. On the other
hand, there might be a bias at main conferences for
focused, incremental papers; features of workshop
papers highlight the exploration of ?interesting? new
ideas/domains. Here, the objective might only be to
show what is ?possible? or what one is ?able to? do.
Main conference papers prefer work that improves
?performance? by ?#%? on established tasks.
Gender: The CFG features for Gender are given
in Table 7. Several of the most highly-weighted
female features include pronouns (e.g. PRP$). A
higher frequency of pronouns in female writing has
been attested previously (Argamon et al, 2003), but
has not been traced to particular syntactic construc-
tions. Likewise, we observe a higher frequency of
not just negation (noted previously) but adverbs (RB)
in general (e.g. ?VP?MD RB VP?). In terms of Bow
features (not shown), the words contrast and com-
parison highly predict female, as do topical clues
like verb and resource. The top-three male Bow fea-
tures are (in order): simply, perform, parsing.
7.3 Author Rankings
While our objective is to predict attributes of pa-
pers, we also show how that we can identify author
attributes using a larger body of work. We make
NativeL and Gender predictions for all papers in the

For each author+affiliation with ?3 first-authored
papers, we take the average classifier score on these
papers.
Table 8 shows cases where our model strongly
predicts native, showing top authors with foreign af-
filiations and top authors in English-speaking coun-
tries.10 While not perfect, the predictions correctly
identify some native authors that would be difficult
to detect using only name and location data. For ex-
ample, Dekai Wu (Hong Kong) speaks English na-
tively; Christer Samuelsson lists near-native English
on his C.V.; etc. Likewise, we have also been able
to accurately identify a set of non-native speakers
with common American names that were working
at American universities.
Table 9 provides some of the extreme predictions
of our system on Gender. The extreme male and fe-
male predictions are based on both style and content;
females tend to work on summarization, discourse,
10Note again that this is based on the affiliation of these au-
thors during the 1990s; e.g. Gerald Penn published three papers
while at the University of Tu?bingen.

etc., while many males focus on parsing. We also
tried making these lists without Bow features, but
the extreme examples still reflect topic to some ex-
tent. Topics themselves have their own style, which
the style features capture; it is difficult to fully sepa-
rate style from topic.
7.4 Correlation with Citations
We also test whether our systems? stylometric scores
correlate with the most common bibliometric mea-
sure: citation count. To reduce the impact of topic,
we only use Style+Syntax features. We plot re-
sults separately for ACL, Coling and Workshop pa-
pers (1990-2000 era). Papers at each venue are
sorted by their classifier scores and binned into five
score bins. Each point in the plot is the mean-
score/mean-number-of-citations for papers in a bin
(within-community citation data is via the AAN ?3

and excludes self citations). We use a truncated
mean for citation counts, leaving off the top/bottom
five papers in each bin.
For NativeL, we only plot papers marked as na-
tive by our Strict rule (i.e. English name/country).
Papers with the lowest NativeL-scores receive many
fewer citations, but they soon level off (Figure 3(a)).
Many junior researchers at English universities are
non-native speakers; early-career non-natives might
receive fewer citations than well-known peers. The
correlation between citations and Venue-scores is
even stronger (Figure 3(b)); the top-ranked work-
shop papers receive five times as many citations
as the lowest ones, and are cited better than a
good portion of ACL papers. These figures sug-
gest that citation-predictors can get useful informa-
tion beyond typical Bow features (Yogatama et al,
2011). Although we focused on a past era, stylis-
tic/syntactic features should also be more robust to
the evolution of scientific topics; we plan to next test
whether we can better forecast future citations. It
would also be interesting to see whether these trends
transfer to other academic disciplines.
7.5 Further Experiments on NativeL
For NativeL, we also created a special test corpus of
273 papers written by first-time ACL authors (2008-
2009 era). This set closely aligns with the system?s
potential use as a tool to help new authors compose
papers. Two (native-speaking) annotators manually
annotated each paper for whether it was primarily
written by a native or non-native speaker (consid-
ering both content and author names/affiliations).
The annotators agreed on 90% of decisions, with an

inter-annotator kappa of 66%. We divided the papers
into a test set and a development set. We applied our
Bow+Style+Syntax system exactly as trained above,
except we tuned its hyperparameters on the new de-
velopment data. The system performed quite well
on this set, reaching 68% F1 over a baseline of only
27%. Moreover, the system also reached 90% accu-
racy, matching the level of human agreement.
8 Conclusion
We have proposed, developed and successfully eval-
uated significant new tasks and methods in the sty-
lometric analysis of scientific articles, including the
novel resolution of publication venue based on pa-
per style, and novel syntactic features based on tree
substitution grammar fragments. In all cases, our
syntactic and stylistic features significantly improve
over a bag-of-words baseline, achieving 10% to 25%
relative error reduction in all three major tasks. We
have included a detailed and insightful analysis of
discriminative stylometric features, and we showed
a strong correlation between our predictions and a
paper?s number of citations. We observed evidence
for L1-interference in non-native writing, for dif-
ferences in topic between males and females, and
for distinctive language usage which can success-
fully identify papers published in top-tier confer-
ences versus wokrshop proceedings. We believe that
this work can stimulate new research at the intersec-
tion of computational linguistics and bibliometrics.
