ABSTRACT 
Improved acoustic modeling can significantly decrease the error 
rate in large-vocabulary speech recognition. Our approach to the 
problem is twofold. We first propose ascheme that optimizes the 
degree of mixture tying for a given amount of training data and 
computational resources. Experimental results on the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ) Corpus show that this new form of output distri- 
bution achieves a 25% reduction in error rate over typical tied- 
mixture systems. We then show that an additional improvement 
can be achieved by modeling local time correlation with linear 
discriminant features. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
To improve the acoustic-modeling component of SRI's DECI- 
PHER TM speech recognition system, our research as focused on 
two main directions. The first is to decrease the degree of mix- 
ture tying in the mixture observation densities, since conrinuous- 
density hidden Markov models (HMMs) have recently been 
shown to outperform discrete-density and tied-mixture HMMs 
\[16\]. The second is the removal of the simplifying output inde- 
pendence assumption commonly used in HMMs. 
Tied mixtures (TM) achieve robust estimation and efficient com- 
putation of the density likelihoods. However, the typical mixture 
size used in TM systems is small and does not provide a good 
representation f the acoustic space. Increasing the number of 
the mixture components (the codebook size) is not a feasible 
solution, since the mixture-weight distributions become too 
sparse. In large-vocabulary problems, where a large number of 
basic HMMs is used and each has only a few observations in the 
training data, sparse mixture-weight distributions cannot be esti- 
mated robustly and are expensive to store. To solve this problem, 
we follow the approach of simultaneously reducing the code- 
book size and increasing the number of different sets of mixture 
components (or codebooks). This procedure reduces the degree 
of tying, and the two changes can be balanced so that the total 
number of component densities in the system is effectively 
increased. The mapping from HMM states to codebooks can be 
determined using clustering techniques. Since our algorithm 
transforms a "less" continuous, or fled-mixture system, to a 
"more" continuous one, it has enabled us to investigate a number 
of traditional differences between tied-mixture and fully continu- 
ous HMMs, including codebook size and modeling of the speech 
features using multiple vs. single observation streams. 
Our second main research direction is focused on removing the 
simplifying assumption used in HMMs that speech features from 
different frames are statistically independent given the underly- 
ing state sequence. In this paper we will deal with the modeling 
of the local temporal dependencies, that is, ones that span the 
duration of a phonetic segment. We will show through the use of 
recognition experiments and information theoretic criteria that 
achieving decorrelation of the speech features is not a sufficient 
condition for the improvement in recognition performance. To 
achieve the latter, it is necessary to improve the discrimination 
power of the output distributions through the use of new infor- 
marion. Local correlation modeling has recently been incorpo- 
rated in our system through the use of linear discriminant 
features, and has reduced the word error rate by 7% on the Wall 
Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 
we present the general form of mixture observation distributions 
used in HMMs, we discuss variations of this form that have 
appeared in the literature, and present an algorithm that enables 
us to adjust the mixture tying for optimum recognition perfor- 
mance. In Section 3 we deal with the problem of local time-cor- 
relation modeling: we comment on the potential improvement in 
recognition performance by incorporating conditional distribu- 
tions, and describe the type of local consistency modeling cur- 
rently used in our system. In Section 4 we present experimental 
results on the WSJ Corpus. These results are mainly a by-product 
of the system development for the November 1993 ARPA evalu- 
ation \[16\]. Finally, we conclude in Section 5. 
2. GENONIC  MIXTURES 
A typical mixture observation distribution in an HMM-based 
speech recognizer has the form 
P(XtlS) = E P(qJs)f(xtlq) 
q E--~(s) 
(i) 
where s represents the HMM state, x t the observed feature at 
flame t, and Q(s) the set of mixture-component densities used in 
state s. We will use the term codebook todenote the set Q(s). The 
stream of continuous vector observations can be modeled 
directly using Gaussians or other types of densities in the place 
313 
off(x t I q), and HMMs with this form of observation distributions 
are known as continuous HMMs \[19\]. 
Various forms of tying have appeared in the literature. When 
tying is not used, the sets of component densities are different for 
different HMM states--that is, Q (s) ~ Q (s') if s # s'. We will 
refer to HMMs that use no sharing of mixture components as 
fully continuous HMMs. The other extreme is when all HMM 
states hare the same set of mixture components--that is, Q(s) = 
Q is independent of the state s. HMMs with this degree of shar- 
ing were proposed in \[8\], \[2\] under the names Semi-Continuous 
and Tied-Mixture (TM) HMMs. Tied-mixture distributions have 
also been used with segment-based models, and a good review is 
given !in \[11\]. Intermediate degrees of tying have also been 
examined. In phone-based tying, described in \[17\], \[13\], only 
HMM states that belong to allophones of the same phone share 
the sanae mixture components--that is, Q(s) = Q(s') if s and s' 
are states of context-dependent HMMs with the same center 
phone. We will use the term phonetically tied to describe this 
kind of tying. Of course, for context-independent models, pho- 
netically tied and fully continuous HMMs are equivalent. How- 
ever, phonetically tied mixtures (PTM) did not significantly 
improve recognition performance in previous work. 
The continuum between fully continuous and tied-mixture 
HMMs can be sampled at any other point. The choice of phonet- 
ically tied mixtures, although linguistically motivated, is some- 
what arbitrary and may not achieve the optimum trade-off 
between resolution and trainability. We have recently introduced 
an algorithm \[4\] that allows as to select he degree of tying that 
attains optimum recognition performance for the given computa- 
tional resources. This algorithm follows a bootstrap approach 
from a system that has a higher degree of tying (i.e., a TM or a 
PTM system), and progressively unties the mixtures using three 
steps: clustering, splitting and pruning, and reestirnafion. 
2.1. C lus ter ing  
The HMM states of all allophones of a phone are clustered fol- 
lowing an agglomerative procedure. The clustering is based on 
the weighted-by-counts entropy of the mixture-weight distribu- 
tions \[12\]. The clustering procedure partitions the set of HMM 
states S into disjoint sets of states 
S = S luS2u  . . .  uS n (2) 
The same codebooks will be used for all HMM states belonging 
to a particular cluster Si. 
2.2. Splitting and Pruning 
After determination f the sets of HMM states that will share the 
same codebook, seed eodebooks for each set of states that will be 
used by the next re, estimation phase are constructed. These seed 
codebooks can be constructed by either one or a combination of 
two procedures: 
? Identifying the most likely subset of mixture components of
the boot system for each cluster of HMM states Si and using 
these subsets Q (Si) c Q (S) as seed codebooks for the 
next phase 
? Copying the original eodebook multiple times (one for each 
cluster of states) and performing one iteration of the Baum- 
Welch algorithm over the training data with the new tying 
scheme; the number of component densities in each code- 
book can then be reduced using clustering \[10\] 
2,3, Reest imat ion  
The parameters are reestimated using the Baum-Welch algo- 
rithm. This step allows the codebooks to deviate from the initial 
values and achieve abetter approximation f the distributions. 
We will refer to the Gaussian codebooks as genones and to the 
HMMs with arbitrary tying of Gaussian mixtures as genonic 
HMMs. Clustering of either phone or subphone units in HMMs 
has also been used in \[18\], \[12\], \[1\], \[9\]. Mixture-weight cluster- 
ing of different HMM states can reduce the number of free 
parameters in the system and, potentially, improve recognition 
performance because of the more robust estimation. It cannot, 
however, improve the resolution with which the acoustic space is 
represented, since the total number of component densities in the 
system remains the same. In our approach, we use clustering to 
identify sets of subphonetic regions that will share mixture com- 
ponents. The later steps of the algorithm, where the original set 
of mixture components is split into multiple overlapping genones 
and each one is reestimated using data from the states belonging 
to the corresponding cluster, effectively increase the number of 
distinct densities in the system and provide the desired detail in 
the resolution. 
Reestimation of the parameters can be achieved using the stan- 
dard Baum-Weleh reestimation formulae for HMMs with Gauss- 
Jan mixture observation densities, since tying does not alter their 
form, as pointed out in \[21\]. During recognition, and to reduce 
the large amount of computation i volved in evaluating Gaussian 
likelihoods, we can use the fast computational techniques 
described in \[15\]. 
In place of the component densifiesf(x t I q) we use exponentially 
weighted Gaussian distributions: 
p(xtls) = qe~s)P(qLs )  \ [N(xt ;~q,~q)\]  a (3) 
where the exponent ?x ~ 1 is used to reduce the dynamic range 
of the Gaussian scores (that would, otherwise, dominate the mix- 
ture probabilities p(q / s)) and also to provide a smoothing effect 
at the tails of the Gaussians. 
3. T IME CORRELAT ION MODEL ING 
For a given HMM state sequence, the observed features at 
nearby frames are highly correlated. Modeling time correlation 
can significantly improve speech recognition performance for 
two reasons. First, dynamic information is very important \[6\], 
and explicit time-correlation modeling can potentially outper- 
form more traditional and simplistic approaches like the incorpo- 
ration of cepstral derivatives as additional feature streams. 
314 
Second, sources of variability--such as microphone, vocal tract 
shape, speaker dialect, and speech rate--will not dominate the 
likelihood computation during Viterbi decoding by being res- 
cored at every frame. We will call techniques that model such 
temporal dependencies consistency modeling. 
The output-independence assumption is not necessary for the 
development of the HMM recognition (Viterbi) and training 
(Baum-Welch) algorithms. Both of these algorithms can be mod- 
ified to cover the case when the features depend not only on the 
current HMM state, but also on features at previous frames \[20\]. 
However, with the exception of the work reported in \[3\] that was 
based on segment models, explicit ime-correlation modeling has 
not improved the performance of HMM-based speech 
recognizers. 
To investigate these results, we conducted a pilot study to esti- 
mate the potential improvement in recognition performance 
when using explicit correlation modeling over more traditional 
methods like rime-derivative information. We used information- 
theoretic riteria and measured the amount of mutual informa- 
tion between the current HMM state and the eepstral coefficients 
at a previous "history" frame. The mutual information was 
always conditioned on the identity of the left phone, and was 
measured under three different conditions: 
I(h.s)--mutual information between the current HMM state s 
and a cepstral coefficient h at the history frame; a single, left- 
context-dependent Gaussian distribution for the cepstral 
coefficient at the history frame was hypothesized, 
? l(h,s/c)--conditional mutual information between the cur- 
rent HMM state s and a cepstral coefficient h at the history 
frame when the corresponding cepstral coefficient c of the 
current frame is given; a left-context-dependent, jointGauss- 
Jan distribution for the cepstral coefficients at the current and 
the history frames was hypothesized, 
? l(h,s/c,d)--same as above, but conditioned on both the ceps- 
tral coefficient c and its corresponding derivative d at the 
current frame. 
The results are summarized in Table 1 for history frames with 
tags of 1, 2, 4 and a variable one. In the latter case, we condition 
the mutual information on features extracted at the last frame to 
of the previous HMM state, as located by a forced Viterbi align- 
meat. We can see from this table that in the unconditional case, 
the cepstral coefficients at frames closer to the current one pro- 
vide more information about he identity of the current phone. 
However, the amount of additional information that these coeffi- 
cients provide when the knowledge of the current cepstra nd 
their derivatives i taken into account is smaller. The additional 
information in this case is larger for lags greater than 1, and is 
maximum for the variable lag. 
These measurements predict hat the previous frame's observa- 
tion is not the optimal frame to use when conditioning a state's 
output distribution. To verify this, and to actually evaluate recog- 
nition performance, we incorporated time-correlation modeling 
in an HMM system with genonic mixtures. Specifically, we gen- 
eralized the Gaussian mixtures to mixtures of conditional Gauss- 
ians, with the current cepstral coefficient x t conditioned on the 
corresponding cepstral coefficient Xto of the history frame to: 
Lag t o 0 1 2 4 Variable 
l I(h, s) 0.28 0.27 0.25 0.19 0.25 
I(h, s I c) 0 0.13 0.15 0.15 0.21 
I(h, s I c, d) 0 0.11 0.14 0.13 0.20

(4) 
We either eplaced the original unconditional distributions of the 
cepstral coefficients and their derivatives with the conditional 
Gaussian distributions, or we used them in parallel as additional 
observation streams. The results on the 5,000-word recognition 
task of the WSI0 corpus are summarized in Table 2 for fixed-lag 
history frames. We can see that the recognition results are in per- 
feet agreement with the behavior predicted by the mutual-infor- 
marion study. The improvements in recognition performance 
over the system that does not use conditional distributions are 
actually proportional to the measured amount of conditional 
mutual information at the various history frames. However, these 
improvements are small and statistically insignificant, and indi- 
cate that the derivative features effectively model the local 
dynamics.

Instead of using conditional Gaussian distributions, one can 
alternatively choose to use features obtained with linear discrim- 
inants. Local time correlation can be modeled by estimating the 
transformations over multiple consecutive flames \[5\],\[7\]. This 
approach as the additional advantage that it is computationally 
less expensive, since the discriminant transformations can be 
computed in the recognizer front end and only once at each 
flame. However, as we will see in the following section, linear 
discriminants gave only moderate improvements in recognition 
performance, and this is consistent with the conditional Gaussian 
results of this section. From the conditional information mea- 
surements that we have presented, we can see that in order to 
provide additional information to the recognizer we must condi- 
tion the output distributions not only on a previous history frame, 
but also on the start ime of the current subphonefic segment, and 
this is an area that we are currently investigating.

4. EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS 
We used the algorithms described in this paper on the 5,000- and 
64,000-word ecognition tasks of the WSJ corpus. We used the 
progressive-search framework \[14\] for fast experimentation. 
With this approach, an initial fast recognition pass creates word 
lattices for all sentences in the development set. These word lat- 
tices are used to constrain the search space in all subsequent 
experiments. In our development we used both the WSJ0 5,000 
word and the WSJ1 64,000 word portions of the database, and 
the baseline bigram and trigram language models provided by 
Lincoln Laboratory. 
4.1. Degree of Mixture Tying 
To determine the effect of mixture tying on the recognition per- 
formance, we evaluated a number of different systems on both 
WSJ0 and WSJ1. Table 3 compares the performance and the 
number of free parameters of fled mixtures, phonetically fled 
mixtures, and genonic mixtures on a development set that con- 
sists of 18 male speakers and 360 sentences of the 5,000-word 
WS\]0 task. The training data for this experiment included 3,500 
sentences from 42 speakers. We can see that systems with a 
smaller degree of tying outperform the conventional fled mix- 
tures by 25%, and at the same time have a smaller number of free 
parameters because of the reduction i  the codebook size.

The difference in recognition performance between PTM and 
genonie HMMs with smaller tying is, however, much more dra- 
marie in the WSJ1 portion of the database. The training data con- 
sisted of 37,000 sentences from 280 speakers, and gender? 
dependent models were built. The male subset of the 20,000- 
word November 1992 evaluation set was used, with a bigrarn 
language model. Table 4 compares various degrees of tying by 
varying the number of genones used in the system. We earl see 
that, because of the larger amount of available training data, the 
improvement i  performance ofgenonie systems over PTM sys- 
tems is much larger (20%) than in our 5,000-word experiments. 
Moreover, the best performance is achieved for a larger number 
of genones--l,700 instead of the 495 used in the 5,000-word 
experiments. These results are depicted in Figure 1.

In Table 5 we explore the additional degree of freedom that 
genonie HMMs have over fully continuous HMMs, namely that 
states mapped to the same genone can have different mixture 
weights. We can see that ying the mixture weights in addition to 
the Gaussians introduces a significant degradation i  recognition 
performance. This degradation i creases when the features are 
modeled using multiple observation streams (see following sec- 
tion) and as the amount of training data and the number of 
genones decrease.

4.2. Multiple vs. Single Observat ion  S t reams 
Another traditional difference between fully continuous and tied 
mixture systems is the independence assumption of the latter 
when modeling multiple speech features. Tied mixture systems 
typically model static and dynamic spectral and energy features 
as conditionally independent observation streams given the 
HMM state, because tied mixture systems provide a very coarse 
representation f the acoustic space. It is, therefore, necessary to 
"quantize" each feature separately and artificially increase the 
resolution by modeling the features as independent: the number 
of "bins" of the augmented feature is equal to the product of the 
number of "bins" of all individual features. The disadvantage is, 
of course, the independence assumption. When, however, the 
degree of tying is smaller, the finer representation f the acoustic 
space makes it unnecessary to artificially improve the resolution 
accuracy by modeling the features as independent. Hence, for 
systems that are loosely tied we can remove the feature-indepen- 
dence assumption. This claim is verified experimentally in Table 
6. The first row shows the recognition performance of a system 
that models the six static and dynamic spectral and energy fea- 
tures used in DECIPHER TM as independent observation streams. 
The second row shows the performance of a system that models 
the six features in a single stream. We can see that the perfor- 
mance of the two systems i  similar.

4.3. Linear Discriminant Features  
To capture local time correlation we used a linear discriminant 
feature xtracted using a transformation f the features within a 
window around the current frame. The discriminant transforma- 
tion was obtained using linear discriminant analysis with classes 
defined as the HMM state of the context-independent phone. The 
state index that was assigned to the frame was determined using 
the maximum a-posteriori criterion and the forward-backward 
algorithm. 
We found that the performance of the linear discriminant feature 
was similar to that of the original features. However, we found 
that an improvement in performance an be obtained if the dis- 
cnminant features are used in parallel with the original features. 
A genonic HMM system with 1,700 genones and linear discrimi- 
nants as an additional feature was evaluated on the 20,000-word 
open-vocabulary November 1993 ARPA evaluation set. It 
achieved word-error rates of 16.5% and 14.5% with the standard 
bigram and trigram language models, respectively. These results, 
however, were contaminated bythe presence of a large DC offset 
in most of the waveforms of the phase 1 WSI1 corpus. We later 
removed the DC offset from the waveforms, and reestimated the 
models using the exact procedure followed during the develop- 
ment of the system used in the November 1993 evaluation. From 
Table 6, we can see that the linear discriminant feature reduced

5. CONCLUSIONS 
New acoustic modeling techniques ignificantly decrease the 
error rate in large-vocabulary continuous peech recognition. 
The genonic HMMs balance the trade-off between resolution and 
trainability, and achieve the degree of tying that is best suited to 
the available training data and computational resources. For 
example, one can decrease the computational load by decreasing 
the number of genones (i.e., increasing the degree of tying) with 
a small penalty in recognition performance \[15\]. Our results on 
the various test sets represent state-of-the-art recognition perfor- 
mance on the 20,000-word open-vocabulary WSI task.
