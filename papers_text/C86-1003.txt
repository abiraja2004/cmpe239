how effective they are in improving the qua\] try and 
accuracy of the machine translation system in each 
phase of analysis and transfer. Therefore, semanti.c. 
features are analyzed by the structure embedded into 
the case frame in Japanese syntactic analysis: these 
features play an important role when selecting words 
in the transfer phase from Japanese into Pkqglish. 
Semantic features  are  more word spec i f i c .  Pairs  
of  deep cases and nouns should be wr i t ten  in the 
lexicon.  }k)wever, due to the huge number of  nouns, i t

~Trans fer  Apprpach to Machine Translation 
We are currently restricting the domain of 
translation to abstract papers in scientific and 
technological, fields. The system is based on a 
transfer approach and consists of three phases; 
analysis, transfer and generation. 
In the first phase, morphological analysis 
divides sentence into lexical items, then syntactic 
analysis is carried out by syntactic and semantic 
analyses of' Case Grammar in Japanese. In the second 
t rans fer  phase, lex ica l  features  are t rans fer red  and 
at, the seine time, the syntact i c  s t ruc tures  are 
transferred by maldn{,; them match tree patterns 
between Japanese and English, Here, we use semantic 
features  Lo se lec t  words for  t rans la t ion  into  
Engl ish.  In the f ina l  generat ion phase, syntact i c  
stru?%urcs are generated by the Phrase St ructurc  
Grammar and the morphological  features  of ErR;lish. 
The fo\] \]owJne; descr ibes  the process ing  fnnct.Jons 
employed in our system. 
Morpholoo:Jeal analysis and generat ion  program 
are descr ibed in L\]:SP, which is  adequate for  
morphological  proeess  in Japanese and Engl ish ,  whi\]e 
syntact i c  ana lys i s ,  t rans fer  and generat ion  programs 
are written in GRADE (Grammar DEscriber). Such 
process  wr i t ten  Jn GRAI)E are independent of natura\]. 
languages in machine t rans la t ion .  GRADE al lows a 
grammar wr i te r  to wr i te  grammars us ing the same 
express ion  in al \]  three phases.  
Grammati ca\] rules written in GRN\]E (Gl~mmar 
DEscr iber)  are  trans\[ .ated in to  in terna l  forllis, which 
are expressed by S-expression in LISP. This

3. Concept of a. Dependency Structure baaed on 
Case Grammar in Japanese; 
In Japan, we \[lave come to the cone\] usion that 
case grammar is the most effective one for" Japanese 
syntactic analysis in machine translation systems. 
This type of grammar has been proposed and studied by 
Japanese linguists before Fillmore's presentation. 
As the word order" is heavily restricted in 
F~iglish syntax, ATNG(Au~nented Transition Network 
Grammar) based on CFG(Context Free Grammar) is 
adequate for syntactic; analysis. However, Japanese 
word order is almost unrestricted and Kok~j_q ,~hi 
(postpositonal case particle) play an important role 
as deep eases in Japanese sentences. Therefore, case 
grammar is the most effective method for Japanese

In Japanese syntactic structure, the word order

the noun lexicon for these nouns. 
Note that we write only the semantic markers for 
these nouns appearing in the context of our samples.

This section describes what the system of 
semantic information for nouns is and what the 
concept of semantic markers is and how semantic 
markers are attached to nouns. 
5.1 System of semant ica l  in fo rmat ion  for  nouns 
1 ) Study 
in the pr imary  s tage  of  our s tudy ,  we thought  
that  a l l  nouns were symbols to d i sp lay  the fo l low ing  
concepts  recogn ized  by humans. We set  up four 
concepts  :in he ighest  leve l  ; "Concrete ob jec ts" ,  
"Abst rac t  concepts" ,  "Phenomena", and "lluman 
actions". Concrete  ob jec ts  are  the selfsame objects 
in the world. Abstract concepts are the standards 
which fix intellectual activities of hunlankind. 
Phenomena include both social, phenomena and natural 
phenonlena. \[\[unlan ac t ions  a re  the  se l f same acted  by 
humans. Wc ass igned  facets  to these  four concepts .  
Then we fu r ther  ext rac ted  the feature  of a park from 
these  facets  and ass igned  a new facet  "Par ts  ? . 
S imi la r ly ,  another  coneept  of "At t r ibute"  was 
ext rac ted  from ?Phenomena ? and "lluman act ions" .  Th is  
feature  i s  c ruc ia l  espec ia l l y  for  ac t ion  nous. Thus 
we added two faeeLs;  "Parts"  and ?At t r ibute" .  Nouns 
a l so  inc lude  concepts  of measurement, space & 
topography and time. So we added three  facets ;  
"Measurements" , "Spaces & Topography", and "Time". 
We c lass i f ied  in to  lnore concepts  as fo l lows .  
The concept  of  concrete  ob jec ts  arc- c lass i f ied  
into "Nat ions & Organ izat ions ' ,  ?Animate objects' arid 
" inan imate  ob jec ts"  which cons t\] Lute th ree  
independent  concepts .  The concept  of  Ihmlan ac t ions  
was elassifJ ed t.wo facets, "Sen:~e & Feel ing" and 
"Act ions ?. 
We ra l l i ed  the scope formed by the concept  
"conceptua l  ca tegory" .  I t  i s  d i f f i cu \ ]k  to de f ine  the  
conceptua l  scope e .xp l i c i t l y .  The concept  which can be 
de f ined  exp l i c i t l y  in  the conceptua l  ca tegory  is 
ca l led  a facet .  The facet  i.s subc \ ]ass i f Jed  in to  a 
number of  semant ic  s lo ts .  Th is  re la t ion  i s  
i l l us t ra ted  i.n f i r :u re  5.1.

2)  SubclassJfication of  Facets 
Facets, for example, were subclassified into 
slots as follows, the facet of Animate objects was 
subclassified as semantic slots ?humans", "animals ~ , 
and "plants ? The facet of Phenomena was 
subelassified as slots "natural phenomena", "physical 
phenomena ? , "power and energies", "physiological 
phenomena", ?soc ia l  phenomena ? and "soc ia l  systems 
and customs'. We then set up an "others" slot in each 
facet, for these words which cannot he assigned to 
any slot. The use of these slots is explained in 
section 5.3. We will study "others" slots through 
semantic analysis for nouns; new slots or facets may 
have to be assigned. 
These semantic slots and facets are named 
semant ic  markers .  The System of Semant ic  Markers for  
Nouns i s  shown in f igure  5.2.  The system of semant ic  
markers  for  nouns i s  made up of  13 conceptua l  facets  
inc lud ing  ~Others ? markers ,  and 49 f i i i a l  s lo ts  as 
term i nal  s. 
We a l so  use Special.  Semant ic  Markers for  
" funct iona l  words" which represent  some pat terns ,  
syntact i c  or semant ic  in fo rmat ion .  For exmnple, the 
word "comparison" presupposes  more than two 
nouns(arguments ) ;  compar i son  between "A" and "B ? . 
Then, "WK(Relation)" as a spec ia l  semant ic  marker i s  
a t tached  to the word ?compar ison".  The word "t ime ? 
assumes time case.  These features suggest  an 
effective dev ice  for semantic analysis. 
5.2  Concept e f  ~mant . i c  Harkers  
The fo l low ing  descr i .bes  concepts  of 12 facets  in  
the System of Semant ic  Markers for  Nouns ( 'Other"  (ZZ)

9) At t r ibutes  (AO) 
"AO" inc ludes words re la ted  to a t t r ibutes  of  
concrete  ob jec ts  and abst rac t  concepts.  Their  s lo ts  
cons is t  of a t t r ibute ' s  names, and a t t r ibute ' s  va lues 
with causal  re la t ions ,  shar~s ,  s t ruc tures ,  
const ruct ions  and nature .  
For exampl.e, the word "color  ? i.s the a t t r ibute ' s  
name(then, marker in AO), words such as "red" and 
"white" are  a t t r ibute ' s  valne.(AC). 
10 ) Measurements (MO) 
"MO" inc ludes words re la ted  to numerals,  name 
for  numerals,  s tandards ,  and un i ts  fo r  measurenlent. 
Examples are  "argument", "fee ?, "s tandards" ,  and 
"ki 1 crueler". 
11 ) Space and 1'opography(SA) 
"SA" inc ludes words referr i .ng to spat ia l  
extentien of concrete objects and abst rac t  concepts. 
Examples are  d i rec t ion ,  area,  o rb i t  and Brazi l  
1 2 ) Time (TF) 
"Tf" inc ludes such words re la ted  to time po in ts ,  
time duratJ.on and tinle a t t r ibutes ,  as "autumn ? , " for  
a week", "every day? and " l i fe  t ime ' .  
5.3 flow te attach semantic markers to words 
\]'he semantic markers for' nouns are deternlined in 
the following steps. 
I) Attach semantic markers to the following 
nouns. 
Propcr houri 
Connnon noun 
Action noun l (Sahen mei sh i  ) 
Action noun P,(exeept ac t ion  noun 1) 
Adverbial noun(only when the words inc lude the', 
concept of  "Time" or "l.ocation" )
In ter rogat ive  pronoun 
Persona\]  pronoun 
Demonstrat ive pronoun (only when the words 
inc lude t i l e  c.oneept of " \[ ,oeation") 
2) Attach semantic markers to the: words 
according to the definition, semantic scope and 
examples given in the "definition table" of semantic 
markers. 
3) Do not attach semantic markers to the 
fo l lowing words :
Molecular formulas 
Ar i thmet ic  express ions  
Names of  product models 
4) \]if a word belongs to mul t ip le  s lo ts  in the 
same facet ,  a t tach  al l  re levant  markers.  
5) i f  a word belongs to a facet  but th i s  word 
not belongs to any appropr ia te  s lo t  in the facet ,  
a t tach  "others"  marker in th i s  facet  to that  word. 
6) i f  a word is  equal to a facet  name i t se l f ,  
a t tach  the semantic marker of  that  facet  name to the 
word. 
7) I f  the concept of  a word i s  not included in 
any facet ,  a t tach  "Others ? faeet(ZZ)  to that  word. 
8) For compound words cons is t ing  of more than 
one word, attach the markers put t ing  in to  
cons iderat ion  semantic in format ion of  the compound 
words themselves;  do not always a t tach  the marker 
only to the las t  element of the compound. 
6.  Sen!anti.c In fo rmat ion for  Adverbs 
In our system, adverbs are subelassified 
fol lows. 
I ) Adverb of condition(Joukyou fuku shi) 
2) Adverb of degree(Teido fuku shi ) 
as 
3) Adverb of stateJnent(Chinjutsu fuku-shi) 
4) Adverb of quantity(Suuryou fuku shi) 
Besides, the aspects of verbs are c\]assified', 
"Mood", "Aspect ? , "Tense ? , and "Degree". They 
cont ras t  spec i f i c  adverbs.  Then semantic in format ion 
for  adverbs i s  used to ensure more accurate  
translations. Semantic information for adverbs are

Ca~:e patterns are used to deternfine the usage of 
verbs having broader concept. This is especially an

We take I{o9o verb " ~hTzZ, "as an example and show 
the d i f fe rence  of  the meanings of verb " ?'1kS " by 
mean of' case paDtern (a), (b), (c). Furthermore we 
show the semantic markers which co- occur to each

In th i s  way, we can determine the usage of verbs 
by means of  ease pat terns  and the semantic markers.  
7.2 In terpretat ion  of  Optional Cases 
One tCqkt!jo:shi (sur face case)  o f ten  p lays  the 
ro le  of  d i f fe rent  deep eases  in Japanese. Often, 
var ious  opt iona l  cases are included in th i s  deep 
ease. Fact optional, case i s  determined by the 
combination of  K(gcujo:s l t t (surface case)  and the 
semantic marker of  the noun which co occurs with i t  
in the d ic t ionary .  In the process  of t rans fer ,  
appropr ia te  Engl ish  prepos i t ions  must be spec i f ied  
according to each determined opt iona l  deep case.  
For example, take kuk~jo -sh i "~ ", The opt iona l  
case i s  deternlined from the semantic marker of  noun 
and the semantic marker which co occurs  with the 
sur face  case of  the verb. 1'hen the case frame in 
Engl ish i s  se lec ted  arid the prepos i t ion  "in" i s  
determined. This process  i s  shown as fo l lows.  
Ex. (1) Source sentence:  J-& L-<J\]t~Eft~D~\]tLz~'6

Trans la ted  sentence:  The numer ica l ly  cont ro l led  
superh igh speed dr i l l i ng  machines are explained which 
are ac t ive  mainly now in markets. 
Explanat ion of  Example (1): Let us observe the 
Japanese Analys is  D ic t ionar ies  for  Noun and Verb 
shown in F igure 7.1. The noun < fl~N (market)> has 
semantic markers (SA and PS) according to Noun 
Dict ionary ,  while verb < ?~\ [~8 (be ac t ive)> has (SA 
or OF) for  the noun according to case s lo t2  of  case 
pat tern  in the verb d ic t ionary .  ?Market" and "be 
active" match with each other with respect to 
smnantic marker "SA". Thus , the surface case < ~ > 
in the Japanese input sentence is determined to have 
the surface case "SA", which corresponds to case 
label < ~> SPAce+ 
Ex. (2) Source sentence : ~flillIgT~l,IIz 2.& t---~N~IIZ%?ilc-) 
Trans lated sentence:  Problems are solved bg two 
handl ing methods about laser  absorpt ion  terms by the 
inverse  damping rad ia t ion ,  and numerical  so lu t ions  
are obtained.  
Explanation of Example (2) : Using these 
Dictionaries, the noun < IN O ~I,'P~ (handling 
methods)> has semantic markers(!C and AN) while verb 
< ~g< (solve)> has (DA, IT, J_C or TS) for the noun 
preceding the Kaknjo-shi. "handling methods" and 
"solve" match with each other with respect to "IC ? .

Thus, the surface case <<'> i.n the Japanese 
sentence is determined to have the surface case "IC", 
which corresponds to case label < ~-~xFR"'Td 4s,~,~ > TOO\]..

transfer dictionary. 
Two examples of selecting the traslation for the 
Japanese verb , "  ~ ' "  a re  as fo i l?us:  
Ex. (1) Source sentence :* l - I  ~ ,~J :U~6?x2 yg  
Trans lated sentence:  The rad ia t ion  and 
convect ion models of  the ver t i ca l  mercury arcs  which 
conta in  the sodium and the scandium iodide.  
gx. (2) Source sentence :~6~iE~f~K 
~J-  a ? 14 ~ b N~ea~No 
Trans la ted  sentence:  Lemmas are ver i f ied  by 
showing spec i f i c  const i tu t ion  methods about 
const i tu t ion  methods of  the normal double orthogonal  
bases which i~c lud~ given normal double orthogonal  
systems. 
Explanat ion of  Example (1): 
Based on the Japanese to Eng l i sh  Transfer  
D ic t ionary ,  F igure 8.1,  both l J-b I O~ (sodium)> 
and < ~5?x~ ~99~ (scandium iodine)> in Example (1) 
have OM. According to the conditions of the 
dictionary, ~ matches one of the semantic markers 
(OSO~jPN PB PP PE) in correspond to the appropriate 
case s lo t  (in th i s  case <. ~ (ob ject  case)> ) of  
Japanese case frame in the d ic t ionary  for  the verb 
<~O> (conta in,  inc lude) .  So verb "contain" is

As for Example(g), the semantic marker for 
< ~g~Y~: .~ ( normal double orthogonal system)> is  
IC, which does not match any of  the semantic markers 
in the appropriate ease s lo t  (in th i s  case 
< ~'t~ (object case)> ) in the d ic t ionary  for the

Acknow \] edgmen 
We would l ike  to thank Prof. Makoto Nagao, Prof. 
Junichi Tsujii, Mr. Junichi Nakamura(F~oto 
University), Mrs. Mutsuko Kimura (Institute for 
Behavior and Science), and Miss Masako Kume(Japan 
Convention Services, Inc.) and the other members of 
the Mu project working group for the useful 
discussions which led to many of the ideas presented 
in this paper. 
I) When semantic markers are attached by human 
operat ion,  severa l  problems ar i se .  The f i r s t  problem 
i s  s imple mistakes made by humans. The second problem 
i s  a f luc tuat ion  of semantic ana lys i s  due to a large 
amount of  data. So i t  i s  necessary to develop an 
automatic marking system to save time and to improve 
efficiency. 
P) When assigning semantic markers to nouns, we 
attached them without considering the relationship 
between nouns and verbs. That is, we attached 
semantic markers simply based on noun concepts. This 
is not adequate to handle nouns which are 
intrinsically related to verbs. One of the solutions 
to this problem will be to study the correlation 
matrix of the semantic markers for nouns in relation 
to the case frame of verbs. 
3) Our system of semantic markers for nouns has 
been designed for Japanese nouns. We have to design a 
syst~, of semantic mgrkers for English nouns. Since 
recognition for its concept in an Enlish word is very 
difficult for the Japanese, we are also studying a 
method of evaluation test to handle these data. 
4) Our system of semantic markers for nouns 
simply consists of the tree structure of facets and 
slots. Subclassification for these structures with 
deep tree structure is a significant problem in order 
to analyze the concept of nouns more in detail, but 
such a semantic marking operation will bec~ne more 
c~nplex and difficult for I), 2) problems. 
5) We suppose that a concept system for words is 
not a static structure, but various semantic networks 
constructed dynamically according to a given sUory. 
We must give thorough consideration to this 
prospective problems.
