Researchers typically use traditional lexical scanner and parser tools for projects requiring 
the recognition of complex text elements. The role relegated to the lexical scanner is 
usually the simple tokenization while the relationships of the tokens to one another is 
done by the parser. Implementation f products or features using these tools for VLC can 
require months of processing or even years. 
In this talk, I will describe how extending the capabilities of the lexical scanner while 
optlmi~ng its performance an allow it to complete the recognition work traditionally 
done by parsers. This technique allows for flexible reprocessing of VLC that might 
otherwise not be done when improvements to algorithms are made. I will illustrate this 
with a case study of the recognition of embedded case law citations, including anaphoric 
references, and case names.
