ABSTRACT 
Information about words--their pronunciation, syntax and 
meaning--is a crucial and costly part of human language 
technology. Many questions remain about the best way to 
express and use such lexical information. Nevertheless, much 
of this information is common to all current approaches, and 
therefore the effort to collect it can usefully be shared. The 
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) has undertaken to pro- 
vide such common lexical information for the community of 
HLT researchers. The purpose of this paper is to sketch the 
various LDC lexical projects now underway or planned, and 
to solicit feedback from the community of HLT researchers. 
1. Introduction 
This paper will give an overview of current LDC efforts 
to develop lexical resources and describe some efforts 
now in the planning stage. Readers are invited to join 
an on-going discussion of priorities, methods and even 
formats for our present and future efforts in this area. 
1.1. Intellectual Property Rights 
Since lexicons, unlike text and speech databases, are 
likely to be incorporated (perhaps in derived form) in 
commercial HLT products, intellectual property rights 
come to center stage. The LDC's charter as a consor- 
tium requires us to leverage the U.S. government's in- 
vestment by sharing the cost of resource development 
among our members. This forces us to limit usage of 
such resources to consortium members, or others who 
have paid an appropriate fee. However, we also want to 
encourage rapid development and broad exploitation of 
commercial HLT technology. Therefore, we need to pro- 
tect our members' investment in research based on LDC 
resources by ensuring their rights to future commercial 
exploitation without additional license negotiations, roy- 
alty payments, or other intellectual property issues. 
This contrasts with the general practice for research use 
of machine-readable dictionaries, in which all rights to 
derived works are typically reserved to the publisher. For 
this reason, our lexicons will not be derived from exist- 
ing lexicons, except as permitted by normal provisions 
of copyright law, or in case we are able to purchase up- 
propriate rights from the owner of the existing resource. 
This also contrast with our practice with respect o text 
databases, where we have negotiated agreements o dis- 
tribute for research purposes many bodies of text whose 
copyright remains with the original owner. The differ- 
ence here is that the text corpora themselves will not 
typically be incorporated in future products, and our 
understanding of the applicable law (which we openly 
explain to information providers) is that language mod- 
els trained on such text are free of any IPR taint. 
We have worked hard, in consultation with our mem- 
bers, to develop an appropriate license for LDC lexi- 
cons. A copy of the draft license agreement for COM- 
LEX syntax will be furnished on request o the author, 
or ldc@unagi.cis.upenn.edu. 
2. Current English Lexicon Efforts 
Our primary effort is to provide lexicons for English. We 
are funding a large, high-quality English pronunciation 
lexicon; an English syntactic lexicon, including detailed 
information about syntactic properties of verbs; and a 
set of improvements in an existing lexicon of English 
word-sense differences. All three lexicons will eventually 
be tied to appropriately sampled occurrences in text and 
speech corpora. 
Based on an original proposal from Ralph Grishman and 
James Pustejovsky, we have been called our English lex- 
icon "COMLEX," for COMmon LEXicon. 
2.1. Pronunciation: PRONLEX 
For the COMLEX English pronouncing dictionary 
("PRONLEX"),  the LDC has obtained (by purchase or 
donation) rights to combine four existing large and high- 
quality lexicons. Bill Fisher at NIST has been carrying 
out a pilot project o design a consensus segment set, and 
to map the representations in the multiple sources into 
it automatically. Then words where the various sources 
agree will be accepted, while disagreements will be adju- 
dicated by human judges, and new words will be added 
as needed. 
13 
The., sources we are starting from will provide coverage 
of more than 250K word forms. Appropriate coverage of 
the words found in the various ARPA speech recognition 
databases will also be guaranteed. We solicit suggestions 
for :lists of other words to cover, such as proper names, 
including surnames, place names, and company names. 
The pronunciation representations u ed in the first re- 
lease of PRONLEX, being based on those in the lexicons 
we are starting from, will be similar to those provided in 
typical dictionary pronunciation fields and used in most 
of today's peech recognition systems. This level is best 
described as "surface phonemic" rather than phonetic-- 
it abstracts away from most dialect variation, context- 
conditioned variation, and casual-speech reduction. 
Pat Keating at UCLA has been carrying out a pilot 
project to examine systematically the relationship be- 
tween such normative pronunciations and the actual 
phonetic segments found when the corresponding words 
are used in conversational speech. We provided a sam- 
ple of occurrences of words with high, medium and low 
frequencies of occurrence, drawn from the Switchboard 
data base. We will use the results of this study to plan 
how to improve the pronunciations in the initial release 
of PRONLEX. Readers are invited to join an on-going 
email discussion of this topic. 
2.2. COMLEX Syntax  
A lexicon of syntactic information, known as "COMLEX 
Syntax," is under development by Ralph Grishman and 
others at NYU. After designing the feature set and rep- 
resentational conventions, Grishman created a zeroth- 
order mock-up from existing resources. This has been 
circulated for comments and is available to interested 
parties from the LDC, along with the specifications for 
the syntactic features and lexical representations to be 
used. The project at NYU is now doing the lexicon over 
? again by hand, guided by corpus-derived xamples. The 
first release will occur later this year. 
2.3. COMLEX Semant ics  
The existing WordNet lexical database, available from 
George Miller's group at Princeton, provides a num- 
ber of kinds of semantic information, including hypo- 
/hypernym relations and word sense specification. In 
order to improve the quality of its coverage of real word 
usage, and to provide material for training and testing 
"semantic taggers," the LDC has funded an effort by 
Miller's group to tag the Brown corpus using WordNet 
categories, modifying WordNet as needed. 
2.4. COMLEX Corpus  
Because of the Zipfian 1/f distribution of word frequen- 
cies, a corpus would have to be unreasonably large in 
order to offer reasonable sample of an adequate number 
of words. Although it is no longer difficult to amass a 
corpus of hundreds of millions or even billions of words, 
complete human annotation of such a corpus is imprac- 
tical. Therefore the LDC proposes to create a new kind 
of sampled corpus, offering a reasonable sample of the 
words in a lexicon the size of COMLEX Syntax, so that 
human annotation or verification of (for instance) four 
million tokens would provide 100 instances of each of 
40K word types? This sampled corpus (in reality to be 
sampled according to a more complex scheme) can then 
be "tagged" with both syntactic and semantic ategories. 
The entire corpus from which the sample is drawn will 
also be available, so that arbitrary amounts of context 
can be provided for each citation. The design of this 
sampled corpus is still under discussion, and reader par- 
ticipation is again invited. 
3. Other Languages 
This past year, we cooperated with the CELEX group 
in the Netherlands to publish their excellent lexical 
databases for English, German and Dutch. In this case, 
our willingness to pay for CD-ROM production, to han- 
dle the technical arrangements for publication, and to 
shoulder some of the burden of distribution was enough 
to help bring this resource into general availability. 
As a first step towards providing new lexical resources 
in languages other than English, the LDC has begun an 
effort to provide medium-sized pronouncing dictionaries 
in a variety of languages. This effort, which will be co- 
ordinated with efforts to provide transcribed speech and 
text resources in the same languages, is beginning this 
year with Japanese, Mandarin, and Spanish. It aims at 
coverage comparable toan English dictionary with about 
20K words. 
As the U.S. speech research community begins to work 
on languages other than English, it is confronted with 
new issues that have reflexes in the design and imple- 
mentation ofeven such a simple-seeming object as a pro- 
nouncing dictionary. Again, we solicit the community's 
participation i helping us choose a useful approach. In 
the next section, we would like to highlight one of the 
questions that will need to be answered, language by 
language, in the early stages of such a project. 
Morphology? The question is, how 
should orthographically-defined units be broken up or 
combined in a lexicon? One answer, which is the eas- 
iest one to give for an English pronouncing dictionary 
14 
for speech recognition applications, is "not at all: list all 
and only the orthographic units paired with their pro- 
nunciations." For other languages, this answer may no 
longer apply. 
Table 1 shows (for 5 databases of journalistic text) how 
? many word types are needed to account for various per- 
centages of word tokens. In all languages except Chi- 
nese, the principles for defining "words" in the text were 
the same: a contiguous tring of Mphabetic characters 
flanked by white space preceded and followed by any 
number of punctuation characters, with case distinctions 
ignored. All "words" containing digits or other non- 
alphabetic haracters were left out of the counts, except 
that a single internal hyphen was permitted. In the case 
of Chinese, the notion of "word" was replaced by "char- 
acter" for purposes of calculating this table. 
As Table 1 shows, languages with a larger number of in- 
flected forms per word, or with more productive deriva- 
tional processes not split up in the orthography (such as 
German compounding), tend to require a larger number 
of word types to match a given number of word tokens. 
The counts for Chinese represent the other extreme, in 
which every morpheme (= Chinese character) is written 
separately, and the orthography does not even indicate 
how these morphemes are grouped into words (either in 
the phonological sense, or in the sense that any Chinese 
dictionary lists tens of thousands of 2-, 3-, or 4-character 
combinations whose meaning is not predictable from the 
meaning of the parts). 
In English, the orthographic word is a fairly convenient 
unit both for pronunciation determination and for lan- 
guage modeling. Depending on the mix of word types in 
the sample, there are only about 2 to 2.5 inflected forms 
per "lemma" (base form before inflection), and the rules 
of regular inflection are fairly easy to write. Productive 
derivation of new words from old (e.g. "sentencize") is
not all that common. Most compounds are written with 
white space between the members, even if their meaning 
and stress are not entirely predictable (e.g. "red her- 
ring," "chair lift"). For these reasons, a moderate-sized 
list of English orthographic forms can be found that will 
achieve good coverage in new text or speech. 
Smoothing is required for good-quality n-gram modeling 
of English word sequences in text, but morphological 
relations among words have not been an important di- 
mension in most approaches. Language models, like pro- 
nunciation models, can thus treat English orthographic 
words as atoms. As a result, from the point of view 
of speech recognition technology, there has not been a 
strong need for an English pronouncing dictionary that 
encodes morphological structure and features. 
However, the situation in German may be different. As 
Table 1 suggests, simple reliance on word lists derived 
from a given amount of German text will produce a sig- 
nificantly lower coverage than for a corresponding En- 
glish case, and even very large lexicons will leave a 
surprisingly large number of words uncovered. Thus 
the Celex German lexicon, which contains 359,611 word 
forms corresponding to 50,708 lemmas, failed to cover 
about 10% of a sample of German text and transcribed 
speech. Of the missing words, about half were regular 
compounds whose pieces were in the lexicon (e.g. Leben- 
squalitdt), while by comparison less than 1/6 were proper 
names. 
The same sort of relative difficulty in unigram cover- 
age can be seen in Table 2, where we look at the count 
of word types for a lexicon derived from one sample in 
order to cover a given percentage of word tokens in an- 
other sample. German requires a two- or three-times 
larger lexicon than English does to achieve a given level 
of coverage, and the factor increases with the coverage 
level. This is not because of differences in the type of 
text--al l  samples are drawn from the same or similar 
newswires, covering the same or similar distributions of 
topics. Spanish is in between German and English in 
this matter. 
One simple approach is to make the lexicon into a net- 
work that generates a large set of words and their pro- 
nunciations. Thus German Lebensqualitdt will be derived 
as a compound made up of Leben and Qualitdt. The 
point of such an exercise is not to shrink the size of the 
lexicon, or to express its redundancies (although both 
are consequences), but rather to predict how the forms 
we have seen will generalize to the much larger number 
of forms we have not seen yet. 
A similar issue arises for inflectional morphology. An 
Italian verb has at least 53 inflected forms (3 persons by 
2 numbers by 7 combinations of tense, aspect and mood, 
plus 4 past participle forms, 5 imperative forms, the 
infinitive and the gerund). Several hundred additional 
"cliticized" forms (joining the infinitive, the gerund and 
three of the imperative forms with various combinations 
of the 10 direct object and 10 indirect object pronouns) 
are also written without internal white space. In a 
database of 3.2M words of Italian, forms of the com- 
mon verb "cercare" to look for occur 1818 times, but 8 
of the 53 regular forms are missing, and a larger num- 
ber of the possible combinations with object pronouns. 
Forms of the (also fairly common) verb "congiungere" 
occur 89 times, and 41 of its 53 forms are missing. This 
indicates both the difficulty of finding all inflected forms 
as unigrams by simple observation, and also the greater 
problem for language modeling caused by the distribu- 
15 
tion of a lemma's probability mass among its various 
forms. 
It is not obvious what the right approach is to these 
cases, so researchers should have convenient access to 
lexicons that can easily be reconfigured to provide vari- 
ous types and degrees of subword analysis. 
Chinese presents exactly the opposite problem. The 
Taiwanese newspaper text used in the counts (done by 
Richard Sproat of AT&T Bell Labs) employs a total of 
about '7,300 character types in a corpus of more than 
17M character tokens. Each character (with a few excep- 
tions) is pronounced injust one way, as a single syllable. 
However, a given syllable might be written as quite a few 
different possible characters, each one (roughly speaking) 
a separate morpheme. There is no inflection in Chinese, 
but there is a lot of compounding of morphemes into 
words with unpredictable meanings. A typical Chinese 
dictionary will list tens of thousands of such combina- 
tions, and new forms are seen all the time, just as in 
German. However, this compounding is not indicated in 
the orthography. 
A language model based on (at least some) compound 
words will of course be effectively of higher order than 
one based only on characters. Again, there are several 
approaches to this question, ranging from explicit list- 
ing of the largest possible number of multiple-character 
words on standard lexicographical criteria, to a simple 
smoothed N-gram model based on individual characters 
as the only unigrams. This issue has a phonetic side 
as well, since multiple-character words in Mandarin of- 
ten have a fixed or strongly preferred stress pattern, and 
at least for some dialects, unstressed syllables may be 
strongly reduced. 
Both issues--explicit representation of the internal 
structure of certain orthographic words, and grouping 
of several contiguous orthographic words as a single lex- 
ical entry--have scattered echoes in speech recognition 
technology as applied to English. However, other lan- 
guages put these (and other) question on the agenda in 
a much stronger form. 
4. New K inds  o f  Lex icons  
New ARPA tasks are likely to require new kinds of re- 
sources. For instance, the outcome of the on-going dis- 
cussion about semantic evaluation will probably moti- 
vate new sorts of lexicons as well as new kinds of anno- 
tated corpora.
