Abstract 
Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the 
type A no B consisting of two nouns A and B with an 
adnominal particle no. As the semantic relations 
between the two nouns in the noun phrase are not made 
explicit, the interpretation of the phrases depends 
mainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns. 
This paper describes the semantic diversity of A no B 
and a method of semantic analysis for such phrases 
based on feature unification. 
1. Introduction 
Japanese has many noun phrase patterns of the 
type A no B. The noun phrase pattern, which consists 
of two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no, 
and which has at least the same ambiguity as B of A 
(and some additional ambiguities not found with the 
equivalent English construction), does not express any 
explicit semantic relations between the two nouns. 
Consequently, its interpretation depends mainly on 
the semantic characteristics of the nouns. Further- 
more, phrase patterns NI no N2 no ... no Nn  often 
appear. Because the number of possible dependencies 
between the constituents is 2 "'I (2n-3)l! / n!, semantic 
analysis of such phrases is necessary to resolve the 
ambiguities. To date, there have been no adequate 
analyses for this linguistic phenomenon, nor have 
there been any clear methodological proposals for its 
semantic analysis. 
This paper describes a) the semantic diversity of A 
no B, b) the analysis of the semantic structure for A no 
B by a unification-based method of semantic function 
application, c) typical semantic structures of A no B, d) 
the possibility of paraphrasing A no B as a noun phrase 
with a relative clause by the addition of a verb, and e) 
the resolution of ambiguities using contextual informa- 
tion from the viewpoint of relation between A no B and 
its corresponding relative clause. 
Although A no B is a simple fo~n, it is interesting 
in two respects. First, A no B represents a general 
linguistic problem for semantic processing. The reason 
is that, in some cases, A or B is a noun form derived 
from a verb or adjective, thus necessitating the seman- 
tic processing of verbs and adjectives. Second, A no B 
can be paraphrased as a noun phrase with a relative 
clause, in just the same way as some English complex 
nominals \[3, 5\]. Putt ing it another way, as information 
is condensed into a simple expression, there are 
ambiguities as to the semantic relations between the 
two nouns. Consequently, contextual analysis plays a 
crucial part in the resolution of the ambiguities. 
2. Semantic Diversity of A no B 
A no B is frequently found in Japanese sentences. 
An  exsmlnation of scientific and newspaper articles 
showed that the occurrence of A no B accounts for about 
half the total number of noun phrases in a text ill\]. The 
other occurrences are noun phrases with relative 
clauses, and coordinated noun phrases. In construc- 
tions of the type A no B, A or B can represent either a 
simple noun, as in Taroo no ie ("raro's house"), NP  of 
the same A no B pattern, as in kariforunia no shuto no 
jinko ("the population of the capital of California"), or 
NP  with a relative clause, as in Watashi ga atta hito no 
na ("the name of the person who I met"). There is also a 
fourth pattern involving an additional particle such as 
kara, made, de and so on, as in Tookyoo kara no 
densha ("the train from Tokyo"). This paper deals 
mainly with constructions of the first type, though the 
method presented here is also applicable recursively to 
patterns of the second and third types: this is possible 
because in such constructions, the semantic features of 
A (i.e. X no Y, or SY) derive from its head (Y). In the 
fourth type, analysis is slightly less straightforward, 
because the particle does provide some additional 
useful information. 
A no modifies a head B to restrict or clarify the 
referencetl. 21 of B. In the example Sutanfoodo daigaku 
no kyooju ("professor at Stanford University"), Sutan- 
foodo daigaku ("Stanford University") restricts and 
clarifies the range of reference for kyooju ("professor"). 
Such A no B constructions can be classified seman- 
tically into five main groups according to the character- 
istics of A and B, as shown in Table 1. The five main 
groups can be further classified into a total of about 80 
semantic relations. In the study mentioned above \[III, 
the authors examined about ten thousand examples of 
A no B occurrences, and checked the semantic relations. 
The appendix shows the semantic relations together 
with examples. It is necessary to analyze these seman- 
123 
Table I Five main groups by the semantic classi.qcation of A no B 
1. B functions as a predicate semantically, and A is its 
argument. 
/care no renhi (:0~ ?) ~,  ~is  love") 
B: ren'ai ( .~,~, "love ~) ... action, 
A: kate (~ .  "he") ... agent of the action 
2. B functions as a case role such as location, and is restricted 
relatively by A. 
gakkoo no nine (.-----~ ?) ~. "front of a school') 
B: nine (~, "front"/"oefore'} ... location/time, 
A: gakkoo (~.  "school') ... object 
3. B is an attribute of A. 
hako no omosa (;U ?3 t ~ , "weight of a box') 
B: omosa( l t  ~ ,  "weight"} ... attribute, 
A: kako(R ,  'q0ox-) ... object 
4. B is an argument of  a predicate functioned semantical ly by A. 
sanpo no h im (~  ?) ~,, "man who strolls') 
B: Aim ( /~,  "man ' )  ... agent, 
A: sanpo ( \ [ '~ .  "strolls") ... action 
5. A is a kind of an attribute value orB. 
kooennok i (~- -~o)YK ,  "tree in a park') 
B: ki (~ ,  "Wee') ... object, 
A: kooen (~  \ [ \ ] ,  "park") 
... value of an object's attribute location 
tic relations in such detail in order to produce good 
quality machine translation from Japanese into Eng- 
Lish among other tasks. To date, linguistic processing 
has not entailed such a detailed classification. 
The semantic structure of A no B is generally a 
function of the meanings of A and B, but the processing 
is not just a simple computation based on the semantic 
contents of A and B. For instance, when B functions as 
a predicate semantically, there is a case relation 
between A and B. However, there are no syntactic 
clues such as a case particle, unlike in full sentences. 
Hence, it is necessary to consider the semantic 
characteristics of A and B in order to analyze the 
semantic structure. 
Processing of context \[12\] is generally necessary to 
determine the correct semantic structure of A no B 
uniquely, as A no B is often ambiguous if considered 
out of context. For instance, in the case of Ft~ransujin 
no hanashi ("speech of a Frenchman"), there are two 
possible semantic relations for Furansuj in  ("French- 
man"): i.e. as agent or content of hanashi ("speech"). 
3. Semantic Structure Analysis of A no B 
3.1 Analysis by Function Application 
The semantic structure of A no B is generally 
analyzed from A and B by "semant ic  function 
application", which is similar to the idea of function 
application in the CUG f ramework  (categorial 
unification grammar) 14. za\], viewing either A or B as a 
functor, and the other as its argument. 
(functor left/right) = (argument) 
(functor result) = (semantic-structure) 
F rom a different viewpoint, this is a generalization of 
the method of case frame analysis in which the analysis 
of the semantic structure of a verb-plus-noun phrase is 
based on the case-frame of the verb. That is, when a 
verb as a functor is applied to a noun phrase as its 
argument, if the noun phrase and a slot of the case- 
frame unify, the semantic structure is obtained as a 
result of assigning the relevant information from the 
noun phrase to the slot- So, the analysis is a kind of 
semant ic  t reatment using the unification-based 
method. In this view, the case frames correspond to 
subcategorization frames, and the analysis corresponds 
to unifications applied to a subcategorization frame Is, s\] 
Characteristics of the function-based analysis are 
mainly to express input-output relations clearly, and to 
put stress on a lexical-based method. 
As  the meaning of A no B depends on the individual 
A and B, it follows that each lexical entry must  have 
information regarding its "functionality". This is also 
the method adopted in CUG.  Furthermore, these 
functors, arguments, and resulting semantic structures 
are represented as sets of at1~ribute-value pairs, again 
as in CUG.  This is also similar to frame representa- 
tions found in AI. The set of attribute-value pairs 
associated with a functor noun and an argument noun 
are generally represented as in Figure 1, and will be 
called a "semantic structure". The characteristics of 
these structures are described in Section 3.3. In the 
representation, the attributes left and right indicate 
an argument for a functor word and a position (direc- 
tion), and the values represent conditions imposed on 
the argument. Syncat, semcat  and sense indicate syn- 
tactic, semantic and head word meaning respectively. 
Marker  indicates the case particle found as a post-posi- 
tion with the noun phrase. Pred gives semantic condi- 
tions which restrict and clarify the relation between A

3.2 Semant ic  S t ruc ture  Ana lys i s  o f  A no  B 
The noun phrase A no B is regarded as a composi- 
tion of A no and B. Therefore, A no B is composed of A 
no and B by the function role of either A no or B. Which  
of A no or B has a function role depends on syntactic 
and semantic characteristic as described in section 3.3. 
Then A no is regarded as being constructed from A and 
no. Accordingly, the semantic structure of A no B is 
analyzed as follows: First, the functor no gets argu- 
ment  A, and makes  a noun phrase A no with the 
semantic characteristics inherited from A. Secondly, 
the functor A no or B gets an argument B or A no 
respectively and makes a noun phrase A no B with the 
semantic characteristics inherited from B. The analy- 
sis process is shown as follows. 
(1) functor: no, argument: A, result: Ano 
(2) functor: Ano, argument: B, result: AnoB,  or 
functor: B, argument: Ano, result: AnoB 
In the case of A p no B (where p is an additional par- 
ticle), A and p are combined first. The semantic struc- 
ture of A p is almost the same as that of A no except for 
the additional information derived from the marker p. 
After this, the final semantic structure is composed in 
the same way as for A no B. This paper focuses mainly 
on the analysis process after constituents of A no B 
have been found, and does not pay specific attention to 
the method of how constituents are found, for which 
purpose the active chart parsing method is used. 
With regard to the composition of A no, we take the 
choice giving no the functor role from the viewpoint of 
generality, although it is possible to view A as having 
this role. No has a functor role that shifts character- 
istics and functions of A to the semantic structure of A 
no, and adds a marker feature to the semantic structure 
of A no. The representation of no is shown in Figure 2. 
In the analysis of A no B, the semantic characteris- 
tics and functions of A and B weigh heavily, because 
although there is an adnominal case particle no, it is 
semantically rather neutral compared with other case 
particles. To put it another way, case particles usually 
function as explicit indicators of the preferred semantic 
interpretation. This fact suggests the significance of 
studying the method of analysis of A no B. 
When A no has a functor role, the functor must get B 
as its a rgument  and extract a semantic relation 
between A and B. For example, in guruupu no shuukai 
("meeting of a group"), guruupu no modifies an action 
nominal  and makes  a result semantic structure 
indicating the semantic relation (agent) as in Figure 3. 
In the representation >pred  indicates a constraint 
that an argument must  have a pred feature. 
The main semantic category of A no B is generally 
taken from the head B of A no" B. However, in some 
cases the semantics of B are different from those of A no 
B, and it is necessary to change the semantic cate-

3.3 Semantic Structures in Five Main Groups 
The characteristics of the semantic structures in the 
f~ve ma/n groups are as follows. 
\[Case 1\] In this case, B, which is the nominal form of 
a predicate (a verb or an adjective), functions as an 
ar~ument~ and A, which is a semantic ase argument 
of B, functions as a functor. Notice that when B 
functions semantically as a predicate, there are two 
alternatives for the assignment of the functor role. The 
first is that the predicate word functions as the functor. 
The second is the reverse L41. This paper adopts the 
latter way mainly because of the characteristic of free 
word order in a Japanese sentence. 
The semantic structure of A and A rw is almost the 
same except for a marker feature, and has the following 
functor role: when A no is an obligatory case (argu- 
ment) of the predicate B, A no unifies with the 
argument feature of" B. When A no is an optional case 
(adjunct), the semantic structure of A no is added to 
that of B as an optional case by unification. The functor 
role is added to A by a kind of lexical rule. Ez~mples 
are shown in Figures 3 and 4. 
\[Case 2and Case 3\] In these cases, B represents a
kind of case role or attr ibute respectively, which 
functions as a predicate. So, functionality is given to A 
in the same way as described above. Examples are 
shown in Figures 5 and 6. 
\[Case 4\] The reverse case of Case 1, that is, A is the 
nominal Form of" a predicate, and B is the semantic ase 
element of the predicate. So B is a functor and A no is 
its argument in the reverse way. The example is shown 
in Figure 7. Kooen ("park") in the example gets an 
argument in the opposite direction to that of example 4. 
The phrase in this case corresponds to a noun phrase 
with a relative clause. So, a feature embedded is used 
in the representation, that is, it means that the pred 
feature is introduced from the complement. 
\[Case 5\] Semantic relations in this case are classified 
mainly into three types : a) relational restriction such 
as a human relation, b) attributive restrict/on such as a 
kind relation and c) situational restriction such as a 
location relation. 
(a) relational restr/ction: This case includes the rela- 
tionships between humans, organizations, and whole- 
part relations. Generally a predicate role is given to B 
and a functor ole is given to A in the same way as Case 
1. An example is shown in Figure 8. In the example, 
sensei ("teacher") has a pred feature and is an argu- 
ment of the functor watasA~ ('I"). 
(b) attributive restriction: A has attributive character- 
istics such as quantity, kind, degree, and property, and 
B is generally a thing. As A functions as a kind of pred- " 
icate, a predicate feature is assigned to A. An example 
is shown in Figure 9 with kooshifima r~o n,,no Ccheck- 
ered-pattern cloth"), where kooshijurna has a pred fea- 
ture and is an argument of the functor ~,,no ("cloth"). 
(c) situational restriction: A has situational meanings 
such as location, time, source, destination, purpose, and 
method, and restricts B by the situation. Like the 
relational restriction case, B is assigned a predicate 
feature, and A a functor ole as shown in Figure 10. In 
the example, doozoo ("oronze statue") has a pred fea- 
ture and is an argument of the functor kooen ("park").

To ass ign  an  appropr ia te  semant ic  s t ruc ture  to a 
noun,  the  fo l lowing character i s t i cs  must  be considered:  
a) A or B wh ich  works  as a pred icate  in some cases 
works  as a modi f ie r  (a rgument  or ad junct )  of a predi-  
cate in the other cases, as with kenkyuu ("research", 
"study") in the example  gengo no  kenkyuu ("study of 
language" )  and  kenkyuu no kaishi ("start of the 
research"). Therefore, A or B generally has both roles 
of a predicate and  a modifier.

Liberty"), and (Ano  (Brm C)) as Kar i fo run ia .san  no 
joosh i tsu  no kome ( " r i ce  of fine qau la i ty  from 
California"). Thus, the middle noun (B) may relate to 
the words on either side (A and C), or to only the right- 
hand word (C). In the ~rst case, the middle noun may 
be an argument of the predicate on both sides. In the 
latter case, the right,hOSt word C may be an argtunent 
of each predicate to the left, the number of which is not 
in general restricted. 
c) There are two cases of (A no (B no C)). When C is a 
nominal predicate, A and B might be separate 
arg~nents as in Kinoo  no Taroo no Sanpo ("raro's walk 
of yesterday"). When C is an ordinary noun, however, 
the analysis is further complicated by the fact that 
implicit predicates such as location, possession, 
attribution etc., are involved, For example, in 
Tookyoo no NTT  no biru ('~rrr's building in Tokyo"), 
the inner predicate structure for NTT no bits ("NTT 
has a building") is attached to the appropriate 
argument of the outer predicate Tookyoo no biru 
Cbuilding is in Tokyo"). 
From the characteristics described above and the 
method for assigning a functor role to an axg~nent of a 
predicate, we adopt the method that a funcmr role is 
added to a constituent by a kind of lexical rule before 
function application. In general, several candidate 
constituents are made by ~he feature structure pre- 
formation. For example, at the stage ofAnoB - Ano  B,  
when B is a functor and has a meaning such as location, 
time and so on, two solutions for B are offered as 
candidates: one as an argument of Ano,  which works 
as a predicate, and the other as an adjunct. 
4 Correspondence between A no  B and  
the Sentence  
4.1 Paraphrase  o f  A no B as  a Noun Phrase  
w i th  a Re la t ive  C lause  
The expression A no B can be paraphrased into A p 
V B or A '  B, adding an appropriate particle p and 
verb / adjective V, or reforming A to a verbal form A'  if 
appropriate. Both A p V and A '  are relative clauses. 
The paraphrased expression is more informative and 
some of the ambiguity is resolved. Paraphrases ofA no 
B in Case 1 - Case 4 are rather easy, as added 
verbs/adjectives do not depend so much on context as 
compared with Case 5. Noun phrases with a relative 
clause for each case in the A no B classification are 
shown in Table 2. 
Such paraphrases are obtained by a change from a 
verb-centered to a noun-centered view. A no B is gener- 
ally related to some event or state in a discourse, and 
the event or state is represented by an appropriate 
predicate: pred(A, B). By taking a noun-centered view, 
the representation is transferred into a representation 
A \[pred(A(*), B)\], that is, A in pred(A, B). 
The expression that gives the corresponding predi- 
cate is taken from the value of the pred attribute in the 
semantic structure. A noun phrase paraphrased with a 
relative clause is generally constructed as follows: 1) 
the head B is put first, 2) a verb is chosen based on the 
rel attribute, and put to the left orB, 3) a noun phrase 
corresponding to the appropriate case role as given by 
the argument structure of the predicate, is constructed 
from A and the particle indicated by a default-marker.  
and put to the left of the verb. For instance, in zoo no 
omosa ("weight of an elephant"), first, the head omosa 
is taken; second, verb rnotsu ("nave") is taken from a 
value of rel, and put to the left of omosa; third, the 
agent zoo ga ("elephant") is put to the left of omosa. In 
this way, the desired complex noun phrase zoo ga motsu 
omosa ("weight hat an elephant has") is arrived at. 
4.2 On Disambiguation by Contextual Information 
Although A no B is semantically ambiguous, it can 
generally be disambiguated by contextual information. 
Although inferences including association and analogy 
are generally necessary, this paper briefly mentions the 
possibility of the disambiguation method by unification 
128 
Table 2 Noun phrase with a relative clause for each case in the A 
no B classification 
\[Case1\] ..* ApVB 
p: ga / o / de / ni (case particles), 
V: suru ("do") I ohonau ("do") / okoru ("happen") 
hare no hehhon ("his marriage") -~ 
bare ga suru kehkon ('marriage that he performs") 
\[Case2\] --, A p V B 
p: ga / o (case particles), 
V: aru ("be') / suru ('do") / shita ('done") 
/e no ma~ ('front of a house") --* 
iegaaru mae ("front of a place where a house is') 
\[Case3\] -* A ga motsu B ("B which has A") 
ishi no omosa ('weight of a stone") --* 
ishi ga motsu omosa ("weight which a stone has') 
\[Case4\] -* A o suruB ("B'whichdoA") 
sanpo no hito ("person who strolls") -~ 
sanpo o suru hito ("person who strolls") 
\[CaseS\] ~ ApVB 
p: n.i I ga I ham / no tame ni (particles), 
V: aru ("be in") / motsu ( 'have') / tsuhurareru ("be made') / 
ohosu ("cause") 
~oen o doozoo ("statue in a park") -b 
hoo~n ni aru doozoo ("statue which is in a park') 
between a predicate structure in A no B semantic 
structure and the related event structure in the 
discourse. A sequence of related events is described in 
a discourse. On  the other hand, the semantic structure 
is represented by an appropriate predicate feature. 
From these, the correct structure can be obtained by 
unifying an event semantic structure with a predicate 
feature in A no B as follows. 
event-semantic-structure-in-context 
- pred-structure-in-semantic-structure-of-A no B 
Here, " - "  means that the left hand side unifies 
with the right hand side. 
Ambiguities of A no B may result from amibiguities 
regarding the predicates that  could be added, 
ambiguities in the words themselves, or ambiguous 
case relations. The d isambiguat ion  process is 
illustrated below using an example in which the added 
predicates are ambiguous. Generally, a verb-centered 
semantic structure is extracted from a sentence. For 
the sentence, 
(sl) Hanako  wa kyonen e o k.aita. 
('~Hanako painted a picture last year.") 
the following semantic structure is obtained. This 
representation is simplified, showing only the 
information needed for the explanation. 
pred: \[reh paint agent: Hanako object: picture\] 
This semantic structure can be obtained also from the 
noun-centered semantic structure as follows. 
picture 
\[pred: reh paint agent: Hanako object: picture(*)\] 
Next, let us assume that the sentence (s2) occurs in the 
context of (sl). 
(s2) Hanako  no e wa tenrankai de yuushoo shita. 
("The picture of Hanako/Hanako's picture 
won the first prize in an exhibition.") 
Hanako  no e ("the picture of Hanako" or "Hanako's 
picture") is ambiguous when taken out of context, with 
a range of possible semantic relations including 
possession, purchase, producer, and content. 
However, the ambiguity is resolved by unifying the 
semantic structure of the previous sentence with each 
of the semantic structures representing the possible 
semantic relations: the only semantic structure which 
can be successfully unified has the producer relation. 
5. Remarks  
This research concerns semantic structures, 
especially those of noun phrases, and was conducted as 
part of a series of research efforts in the LUTE 
(Language Understander, Translator, & Editor) project 
\[e, 7. I0, nl To date, ten thousand examples of A no B 
have been collected from scientific and newspaper 
articles, and the appropriateness of the classification of 
A no B investigated. In addition, as a preliminary 
experiment, a semantic relation analysis was tried 
with about a thousand examples, with rather 
satisfactory results. The mean ing  of A no B is 
generally ambiguous, and contextual information is 
needed to resolve the ambiguities. There seems to be 
variety of such ambiguities relating to contextual 
information, but in principle such ambiguities are 
considered to be resolved by assuming appropriate 
predicates as described in this paper.
