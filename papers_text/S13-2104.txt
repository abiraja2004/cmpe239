Abstract 
Drug name entity recognition focuses on 
identifying concepts appearing in the text that 
correspond to a chemical substance used in 
pharmacology for treatment, cure, prevention 
or diagnosis of diseases. This paper describes 
a system based on ontologies for identifying 
the chemical substances in biomedical text. 
The system achieves an F-1 measure of 0.529 
in the task.  
1 Introduction 
Named entity recognition (NER) involves 
processing text and identifying certain occurrences 
of words belonging to particular categories of 
named entities. In recent years, much attention has 
been paid to the problem of recognizing gene and 
protein mentions in biomedical abstracts for 
different purposes such as information extraction, 
relation extraction or information retrieval. In this 
case we focus on the pharmacological domain. 
Furthermore, some initiatives have promoted the 
evaluation of different systems of named entity 
recognition and relation extraction in the 
pharmacological domain. This is the case of 
Semeval 2013: Recognition and classification of 
drug names task1 (Segura-Bedmar et al, 2013), 
where the system presented in this communication 
has been evaluated.

2013/task9/data/uploads/task-9.1-drug-ner.pdf 
  Following the annotation guidelines of the task, a 
drug is a substance that is used in the treatment, 
cure, prevention or diagnosis of disease. Moreover, 
each drug name entity can be classified in four 
different types: drug, brand, drug_n and group. 
Our system uses biomedical ontologies and 
external resources (containing biomedical 
information) as input to determine whether we are 
treating a drug name entity or not.  
  The resource integration seems to represent an 
improvement since the knowledge available for 
identifying entities is higher. Some biomedical 
resources such as Drugbank2, Kegg3, Pubchem4 or 
Drugs.com5 focus on providing a compound of 
information collected from different sources.  
  Section 2 exposes some related work in the field 
of NER. In section 3 we describe the system used 
for identifying drug name entities. Section 4 
presents the results obtained by the system and a 
little comparison with other approaches. In section 
5 we outline some conclusions obtained and ideas 
for future work.  
 
2 Related work 
The field of NER has been very studied in recent 
years, and has been faced in many approaches. 
Since text structures are frequently used to 
characterize documents in text mining algorithms, 
there only stand out those based in terms and

concepts. This is due to that concept-based systems 
represent the semantic content with a smaller 
number of characteristics, opposite to the term-
based systems based on characters or words. 
Concept-based and term-based representations 
mainly differ in the implicit or explicit appearance, 
respectively, of the words identified in the 
document. This fact implies that concept-based 
extraction techniques are more complex, requiring 
the use of more advanced computational linguistics 
techniques and a greater dependence on knowledge 
domain. 
  One reference system that focuses on concept 
recognition in the biomedical domain is MetaMap 
(Aronson, 2001). MetaMap is a program developed 
by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) that 
uses the UMLS Metathesaurus for annotating the 
concepts in a given text. The program is designed 
to obtain the concept that best fits a particular 
phrase, finding its origin in an attempt to improve 
the retrieval of biomedical literature indexed in 
MEDLINE/PubMed. MetaMap is a program with 
many strengths, such as the power of linguistic 
analysis, the high performance setting possibilities 
and the variety of processing algorithms included. 
On the other hand, MetaMap shows some 
weaknesses such as the algorithms developing 
focused on English grammar texts, or high 
processing time lapse due to the complexity of the 
algorithms (not suitable for real-time systems). 
Metamap analysis time periods goes from less than 
a minute for short simple text to long hours for 
complex sentences. 
  Gimli (Campos et al, 2013) is an open source and 
high-performance solution for biomedical named 
entity recognition on scientific documents, 
supporting the automatic recognition of gene, 
proteins, DNA, RNA, and cell domain names. This 
tool implements a machine learning approach 
based on conditional random fields (CRF).  
  On the other hand, there exists a more recent 
concept extraction techniques based on ontologies. 
Ontologies link concept labels to their 
interpretations, ie specifications of their meanings 
including concept definitions and relations to other 
concepts. Apart from relations such as isa and 
part-of, generally present in almost any domain, 
ontologies also model domain-specific relations, eg 
clinically-associated-with and has-manifestation 
are specific associations for the biomedical 
domain. Therefore, ontologies reflect the structure 
of the domain and constrain the potential 
interpretations of terms. Thus, ontologies can 
provide rich concept knowledge of domain specific 
name entities. This is the case of Open Biomedical 
Annotator (OBA) (Jonquet et al, 2009), an 
impressive annotation system using ontologies, 
which provides online access for users and for 
other systems as a Web service. There are other 
examples of utilities for extracting concepts using 
ontologies (e.g. Terminizer (Hancock et al, 2009), 
Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al, 2008) or 
Reflect (Pafilis et al, 2009)). However, the 
magnitude of ontologies and resources integrated 
under the OBA Web service is difficult to reach by 
other systems (Whetzel et al, 2011): in three years 
623
(from 2008 to 2011), they have increased from 72 
to 260 biomedical ontologies. 
  The concept recognition tool used by the OBA 
system -in order to find ontology concepts 
matching the terms extracted from texts- is called 
Mgrep. Although Mgrep is not a free tool, some 
results are presented in (Jonquet et al, 2008). A 
comparison between Mgrep and MetaMap can also 
be found in (Shah et al, 2009), where they make 
an evaluation over a biological and disease terms 
dictionaries with precision (0.87 to 0.71 
respectively) and recall (1548 to 1730 recovered 
terms respectively) metrics. Thus, we decided to 
use Mgrep for identifying drug name entities in the 
system. 
 
3 Description of the system  
The system (see figure 1) is divided in two phases: 
(i) in one hand, the system must scan drug name 
entities without specifying any further information. 
This is the so-called entity identification process; 
(ii) on the other hand, the system classifies by 
using a rule-based process the type of the entities 
discovered previously. This is the so-called entity 
classification process. 
The corpus is processed sentence by sentence, 
using the identification tag provided for each 
sentence.  
 
 
 
 
3.1 Entity identification process  
In this phase we analyze each sentence of the 
corpus with Mgrep analyzer. This tool allows us to 
set the ontologies we want to use in the analysis. 
All additional ontologies used in the analysis 
increases the computational complexity required.  
 
The ontologies used in this first drug name 
identification phase belong to UMLS collection, 
and more specifically to the pharmacological 
domain: 
? Master Drug Data Base6 (MDDB): National 
Drug Data File ontology provides a codified 
drug dictionary, drug vocabulary, and drug 
pricing for prescription drugs and medication-
based over-the-counter products in the United 
States. It supports the ever-changing world of 
drug information in healthcare. 
? National Drug File7 (NDF): this ontology 
contains information about a comprehensive 
set of drug database elements and clinical 
information approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and dietary 
supplements information. 
? National Drug Data File (NDDF): this is an 
extension of the NDF ontology that includes 
chemical ingredients, clinical kinetics, 
diseases, dose forms, pharmaceutical 
preparations, physiological effects and

therapeutic categories. 
? Ontology for Drug Discovery Investigations: 
this ontology contains information about 
description of drug discovery investigations 
from OBO8 relation ontology. 
? MESH Thesaurus9: this ontology contains sets 
of terms naming descriptors in a hierarchical 
structure. There exist 26,853 descriptors and 
over 213,000 entry terms in 2013 MeSH. 
 
For each drug name entity identified the Mgrep 
analyzer provides information about the ontology 
concept recognized, term information, snippet of 
original text (see figure 2a). After identifying drug 
name entities we noticed some errors in the 
recognized concepts, thus we held a post-
processing of the analysis results. Some entities are 
recognized by several ontologies at the same time, 
so it is necessary to filter repeated instances. 
Biomedical complex name entities are not 
identified. To solve this, we join compound name 
entities by following the charoffset of the sentence. 
The system only links two or more drug entities 
that were next to each other, without punctuation 
between them. For example, potassium chloride 
(see figure 2b) is recognized separately in 
potassium and chloride, so we group it as 
potassium chloride concept.  
As a result of this process we obtain a list of 
clear drug name entities that conforms our run 1 
approach in the task. However, we elaborate a 
second filter based in a gazetteer containing terms 
with no useful meaning for our drug name entity 
identification purpose. This gazetteer contains 
terms such as agent, compound and blocker. The 
results of this second filter conforms our run 2 
approach in the task. As a result of entity 
identification phase we obtain a list of drug name 
entities, but they are not identified as any type yet.  
3.2 Entity classification process  
In this phase we classify the list of pharmaceutical 
terms obtained from analysis phase. To do so, we 
elaborate a rule-based system following the 
annotation methods described in the task 
guidelines. This annotation method was based in 
biomedical resources, such as DrugBank, for 
determining aspects as if the drug entity is

approved for human use, or if the drug entity is 
registered as a brand name. We can organize the 
general rules of the classification process by 
resources used: 
? DrugBank: These rules search the drug entity 
in DrugBank resource and obtain several 
information: 
o Drug information: information about 
approval state of the drug (approved, 
experimental, illicit). A rule classifies 
a drug entity as drug_n when 
experimental or illicit state is found in 
a drug, otherwise the drug entity is 
catalogued as drug type. 
o Synonym list: list of possible 
registered names of the entity. A 
recursive process searches each 
synonym in DrugBank (obviating the 
synonym list this time), and applies the 
rules as if original drug entity were 
treated. The result of the recursive 
process affect to the original drug 
entity. 
o Brand name list: list of registered 
commercial brand names of the entity. 
If a drug name entity is found in the 
brand name list, then it is catalogued 
as a brand type. 
o Categories: information about general 
category of drug. If the drug is found 
as a category, then it is classified as 
group type. 
? Pubchem: These rules search the drug entity 
and obtain information of drug identification 
and compound information and IUPAC name. 
? ATC Index10: These rules look for the drug 
entity in ATC Index resource and determine 
whether the entity is drug or group depending 
on the level of ATC code found.  
? Kegg: These rules search the drug entity in this 
resource and obtain information of drug 
categories. If the drug is found as a category, 
then it is classified as group type. 
? MeSH11:  These rules search information about 
MeSH tree categories classification of the drug 
entity. If the drug is found as a category, then 
it is classified as group type. Another rule 
makes a na?ve processing of the MeSH

description text to evaluate if the drug entity 
were used in humans. If this information is 
found in the text, then the drug entity is 
classified as a drug type. 
  
The described rules are representative examples 
of the complete rule-based system. There were 
assigned priorities to the rules, since some rules are 
more certain to describe a drug type than others. 
Thus, if a drug entity is found to be approved for 
using in humans after processing the MeSH text, 
but when looking the DrugBank state is found as 
illicit state, then the drug is classified as drug_n 
type since DrugBank offers a certain state of the 
drug, instead of a natural text description that may 
be classified as a false positive. Depending on the 
values collected on these biomedical resources the 
rule-based system determines whether the type of 
an entity is a drug, group, brand or drug_n. 
 
 
4 Results 
The best result in entity identification (exact 
matching) obtained by the system correspond to 
run 2, achieving a F1 measure of 0.609. On the 
other hand, the best results achieved in strict 
matching (boundary and type evaluation) 
correspond to run 2 again, with 0.529 F1 score. 
 
 
 
 
 
These results contrast with the result obtained by 
run 1, achieving a F1 measure of 0.528 and 0.458 
in entity identification and strict matching 
evaluation respectively. Thus we can quantify the 
advantage of using a filter based on gazetteer in an 
average increment of 0.079 F1 measure. 
We have noticed that the higher results are 
obtained in partial matching evaluation because of 
the relaxed conditions of the charoffset. This seems 
reasonable since complex multiword entity is hard 
to parse and define an exact charoffset. 
On the other hand, we also noticed that 
evaluating the classification of the type decrement 
the best results obtained by the system from 0.609 
to 0.529 of F1 score. This indicates that there is 
still a lot of improvement work in the rule-based 
system for type classification. A little error 
analysis was done in a set of 10 documents of the 
training dataset. The results show errors in 
conflictive entities that show multiples categories 
in DrugBank resource. Thus, for example cocaine 
drug entity contains tags of illicit and approved in 
DrugBank database, so the system classify this 
entity as drug_n instead of drug.  
 
5 Conclusions and future work 
In this paper we present a system for drug name 
entity recognition based on ontologies as 
participation for ?Semeval 2013: Recognition and 
classification of drug names? task. The system is 
based on integration of biomedical resources for 
identification and classification of pharmacological 
entities. The best result of the system obtained an 
F1 measure of 0.529.  
The usage of ontologies in named entity 
recognition task seems to be a good choice since 
we can select specific ontologies. A possible future 
work includes an improvement of rule-based 
system, including a bigger collection of biomedical 
resources.  The entity classification could increase 
the results by creating an hybrid approach between 
rule-based methods and machine learning 
techniques. On the other hand, in the entities 
identification task, the system could include other 
biomedical text analyzers and establish a vote 
system. This would improve whether we consider 
an entity or not. Finally, in error analysis were 
noticed problems related to rule-based module. 
Therefore, an insightful improve could pass 
through making a context analysis in order to clear 
the ambiguity surrounding the drug entity.
