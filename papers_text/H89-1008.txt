ABSTRACT 
Developing knowledge bases for AI systems takes too long and costs too much. 
Even a "portable" system may be expensive to use because its installation takes 
a long time or requires the labor of scarce, highly-trained people. BBN has 
recently created a tool for acquisition which dramatically reduces the  time and 
cost of installing a natural language system. 
During 1988, BBN used its Learner tm tool to configure the Parlance tm database 
interface to two different versions of a large Navy database. The 
configuration process was performed primarily with development versions of 
the Learner, which is a software tool for creating the knowledge bases, 
vocabulary, and mappings to the database that enable the Parlance interface 
to understand questions addressed to a particular database. The Learner 
reduced the time required to create Parlance configurations from months to 
weeks, and demonstrated that the Learner works effectively on databases with 
many hundreds of fields. 
INTRODUCTION 
THE NAVY'S IDB DATABASE 
The IDB (hereafter called the Navy database) is a large, evolving database 
being used in the Fleet Command Center at the Navy's Pacif ic Fleet 
headquarters in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii \[Ceruti, 1988\]. It has dozens of tables and 
hundreds of fields containing information about hundreds of U.S. ships, 
planes and other units, as well as more limited data on foreign units. 
Examples of the kind of information that may be available for a particular unit 
are: its home port, current location, current employments (an employment is a 
complex concept including destination, projected arrival time, purpose, etc.), 
type and amount of equipment on board, various types of readiness status 
(personnel readiness, equipment readiness, overall  readiness, etc.), and 
operat ing characterist ics (average cruising speed, maximum speed, fuel 
capacity, etc.). Other data in this database include detailed information about 
the characteristics of various types of equipment (e.g., the firing rate of guns) 
and properties of geographic entities (e.g., for ports, the country they are in, 
and whether they have a deep channel). 
The Navy database provides basic data for systems under development at the 
Fleet Command Center. This database offers a rich environment for a natural 
language interface, because the need to explore the database with ad hoc 
queries occurs frequently.

THE PARLANCE INTERFACE 
The Parlance interface from BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation is an 
English language database front end. It has a number of component parts: a 
graphical user interface, a language understander that translates English 
queries into database commands for relational database systems such as Oracle 
and VAX Rdb, a control structure for interacting with the user to clarify 
ambiguous queries or unknown words, and a dbms driver to call the database 
system to execute database commands and to return retrieved data to the user. 
The Parlance system uses several domain-dependent knowledge bases: 
1. A domain model, which is a class-and-attribute r presentation of 
the concepts and relationships that the Parlance user might employ in 
quer ies .  
2. A mapping from this domain model to the database, which specifies 
how to find particular classes and attributes in terms of the database 
tables and fields of the underlying dbms. 
3. A vocabulary, containing the lexical syntax and semantics of words 
and phrases that someone might use to talk about the classes and 
attr ibutes.  
4. Miscellaneous additional information about how information is to 
be printed out (for example, column headers that are different from 
field names in the database). 
The Learner is used to create these knowledge bases. 
The following queries illustrate the kinds of questions that one can ask the 
Parlance system after it is configured for the Navy database: 
What's the maximum beam of the Kitty Hawk? 
Show me the ships with a personnel resource readiness of C3.1 
List the ships that are C1 or C2. 
Is the Frederick conducting ISE in San Diego? 
How many ships aren't NTDS capable? 
Which classes have a larger fuel capacity than the Wichita? 
How many submarines are in each gee region. 
Are there any harpoon capable C1 ships deployed in the Indian Ocean whose 
ASW rating is MI? 
List them. 
Show the current employment of the carriers that are C3 or worse, sorted by 
overall readiness. 
Where is the Carl Vinson? 2 
What are the positions of the friendly subs? 
1 Readinessos of various types are categorized C1 (most ready) to C5 (unready), M1 to M5, 
and so on. 
2 This query is ambiguous. It may be asking for a geographical region or for a latitude 
and longitude. The Parlance system recognizes the ambiguity and asks the user for 
clarification.

THE LEARNER 
The Learner is a software tool that creates the domain-dependent knowledge 
bases that the Parlance system needs. It "learns" what Parlance needs to know 
from several sources: 
1. The database system itself (i.e., the dbms catalogue that describes 
the database structure, and the values in various fields of the 
database).  
2. A human teacher (who is probably a database administrator, 
someone familiar with the structure of the database, but who is not a 
computational linguist or AI expert). 
3. A core domain model and vocabulary that are part of the basic 
Parlance system. 
4. Inferences (about such things as morphological and syntactic 
features) that the Learner makes (subject to correction and 
modification by the teacher). 
Figure 1 shows the input and output structure of the Learner. We call the 
process of using the  Learner configuring Parlance for a particular 
appl icat ion.  
The human teacher uses the Learner by stepping through a series of menus 
and structured forms. The Learner incrementally builds a structure that can 
be output as the knowledge bases shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The Structure of the Learner 
85 
The teacher chooses particular actions and is led through steps which elicit 
related information that Parlance must know. For example, when the teacher 
designates that a particular table or set of tables belong to a class named 
"ship", the Learner immediately allows the teacher to give synonyms for this 
class, such as "vessel". The Learner will then infer that the plural form of the 
synonym is "vessels", instead of making the teacher supply the plural form, 
although the teacher can easily correct the Learner if the word has an 
irregular plural. 
Whenever information is optional, the teacher can decline to specify it at the 
first opportunity, and can later initiate an action to provide it. Both required 
and optional information can be changed by the teacher using the Learner's 
edit ing capabil it ies. 
The ability to assign names freely, the freedom to do many operations in the 
sequence that makes the most sense to the person using the Learner, and the 
fact that the Learner expresses instructions and choices in database terms 
wherever possible, make it easy for database administrators who are not 
computational linguists or AI experts to configure the Parlance interface. 
CONFIGURING PARLANCE 
Before the Learner existed, Parlance configurations were created "by hand". 
That is, highly skilled personnel had to use a separate set of programs 
(including a Lisp editor) to create the appropriate configuration files. 
Figure 2 compares this by-hand conf igurat ion process with the first 
experience using the Learner on the Navy database. The two examples used 
different databases, but in each case we began with a large set of sample 
queries in the target domain,  and periodical ly tested the developing 
configuration by running those queries through the Parlance system. We 
measured our progress by keeping track of the number of those queries the 
system could understand as the configuration process went on. Figure 2 
actually considerably understates the productivity enhancement realized with 
the Learner,  because the personnel  database used for the by-hand 
configuration was much smaller and less complex than the Navy database. 
The Navy database used to test the first version of the Learner was 
considerably restructured and enlarged, and we had an opportunity to 
configure Parlance for the  newer database. Since we had a new, improved 
version of the Learner, we chose to configure Parlance to the second version 
of the Navy database "from scratch", rather than by building on the results of 
the first configuration. This gave us an opportunity to measure the effort 
required to use the Learner to do a much larger system configuration, since 
the size of the target database (measured in terms of the number of fields) had 
nearly tripled.

Figure 2. Speed-up of acquisition using the Learner 
The results in Figure 3 and its accompanying notes show that the Learner 
robustly scaled up to the task, and that the time required to perform the 
configuration increased much less than the number of fields in the database, 
the vocabulary size, or any other simple metric of size. In fact, for a modest 
1/3 increase in configuring effort, a configuration roughly 3 times larger was 
created.

Notes to accompany Figure 3: 
(0) Changes in the underlying system since this configuration was created 
make it impossible to measure some of the numbers in this column accurately, 
so the numbers dealing with vocabulary are estimates. 
(1) Records were not kept at the time this configuration was created, but the 
configuration happened over a period of months. 
(2) That this level of effort includes not just time spent using the Learner but 
also time required to understand the domain, and to do some testing and 
revision. About 60% of this time was spent using the development version of 
the Learner. 
(3) Records were not kept at the time this configuration was done, but it 
involved many person-months. 
(4) This is an estimate which includes inflected forms of regular words and 
words that were acquired directly from database fields. 
(5) This includes words read from the database and all words directly 
represented in the vocabulary; it excludes inflected forms of morphologically 
regular words. 
(6) This is a rough measure of the semantic complexity of the domain, since it 
excludes words that are abbreviations or synonyms. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The Learner significantly reduces the time required to create configurations 
of the Parlance natural language interface for databases with hundreds of 
fields from months to weeks. This dramatic speed-up in knowledge acquisition 
scales up robustly, and works as effectively on large databases as it does on 
small ones.
