AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN TEXTS AND 
LINGUISTIC DATA 
1. First of all I would like to give an account of the practical expe- 
rience gained in the course of processing the about 60,000 or so entries 
of a Hungarian unilingual (explanatory) dictionary (.4 magyar nyelv 3rtel- 
mez6 szdt,~ra, vv. I-VII, 1959-1962). In this case by " text"  we mean 
this non-natural corpus, that is the sum total of the entries of the dic- 
? tionary; and by linguistic data the information given below. 
1.1. Naturally the head-word itself is a linguistic datum as well, 
as long as it is processed according to its component letters, the pho- 
nemes represented by them, and its sounds. Furthermore we coded 
also the following data in explicit form beside each head-word: 
(1) complexity (how many roots does the lexeme consist of), 
(2) homonymy, 
(3) part of speech (in case of conversion each possible form class 
denoted), 
(4) the number of meanings, 
(5) style, 
(6) morphological data (for words capable of inflexion), 
(7) strongly required government (only for verbs), 
(8) etymology, 
(9) suffix, 
(10) length (this latter datum, of course, was coded not by us; 
it was decided and punched on the card in the proper place by the 
processing machine). 
1.2. It is a natural concomitant of the ~iutomatic processing that 
we can get back any combination of these linguistic data so as to draw 
conclusions from it; and that in order to answer a particular question 
we can ask for special outputs. In the following account I am going 
288 ~lU~l~C 1,API, 
to set forth such questions of theoretical or practical character and the 
answers given to them. 
1.2.1. Some of the conclusions issued simply from the differ- 
ent mechanical rrangements of the material. So we got data as regards 
the length of the lexemes included in the examined ictionary, (though 
these data must be viewed critically: in a larger dictionary there would 
be presumably a greater number of longer words for any language 
(F. PAPP, 1970), as regards their distribution according to the num- 
ber of their meanings (presumably this index too depends, however, 
on the size of the dictionary and in a very large dictionary it would 
come close to 1 meaning per lexeme (F. PAPP, 1970)). As a result 
of simple, mechanical arrangements, it was interesting to see the 
entire material of the dictionary grouped according to complexity 
-derivation, all the homonyms collected, the elements belonging 
to the same parts of speech (in the case of conversion all the possible 
combinations of parts of speech) put together, etc. 
1.2.2. On the basis of these simple arrangements a project has 
been started in the course of which the 60.000 entries and the morpho- 
logical information concerning them have been put into the memory 
of the machine and have been used as the basis on which natural Hun- 
garian texts can be analysed. (The director of the project is Gy. Hell, 
Budapest Technical University). We are still at the beginning of this 
work, but there is reason to suppose that a mechanical dictionary having 
at its disposal the appropriate grammatical information renders an auto- 
matic analysis of optimum efficiency possible. 
1.2.3. The information given by the dictionary led to some fur- 
ther synchronic and diachronic onclusions. Let me quote two exam- 
plea: 
1) Certain forms of the noun (a possessive form and others 
formally similar to it) have long been a problem in Hungarian. In 
these forms the suffLxes occur sometimes with a j element, sometimes 
without it: Idba "his/her foot" (from /db "foot ") without a j ele- 
ment and combja "his/her thigh" (from comb "thigh ") with a j ele- 
ment. The appearance of the j seems extremely arbitrary: as our pair 
of examples indicates, it sometimes does and sometimes does not oc- 
cur even after the same consonant (in this case after b); in spite of the 
fact that the Hungarian system does not favour consonant clusters, it 
AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN TEXTS 289 
rather appears as a third or fourth consonant after a final consonant 
group fairly inconvenient in itself (like in this case the -rob: comb), 
than after a single consonant at the end of a lexeme, etc. After the 
analysis of several special arrangements of the material it turned out 
that the j serves actually to emphasize the unusual, rare, young, etc. 
stem-endings; that is why it appears after for example unusual conso- 
nant combinations. This treatment of the stem-ending (the special 
emphasis given to it) throws light on the one hand on the behaviour 
of the stem in an agglutinating system; on the other hand on the at- 
titude of the speaker and the listener, who - it seems in this case - 
seek to do the automatic analysis with the help of a minimal dictionary. 
Without the j element he listener would be turning to his inner dic- 
tionary all the time while doing the analysis: this way, however, he 
either meets a typical, frequent, etc. stem-ending, which therefore he 
recognizes easily; or a special j element helps him to divide the word 
(by showing where the comparatively independent suffix-cluster of 
the agglutinating system begins). 
2) The analysis of the 6000 unquestionable root-words included 
in the dictionary (and of the 4000 or so elements that can be regarded 
in a wider sense as root-words too) led to several results. So for instance 
it came to light that vowel-harmony which is of central importance 
to the system of the Hungarian language, has undergone an interesting 
change during the one thousand years of the history of the Hungarian 
language we can directly trace back. While in the Finno-Ugrian and 
ancient Turkish etymological strata the velar and palatal stems are 
represented half-and-half; the chronologically successive tymological 
strata (such as Slavic, German, etc.) contain more and more velar 
elements; as regards the Latin elements, which belong to the youngest 
ones, the great majority of them is velar. The data indicate as well 
that vowel harmony holds its own in the system of present-day Hun- 
garian as well and solves easily, almost without any uncertainty the 
vocal adaptation of the loanwords which have been streaming contin- 
uosly into the language for thousand years. 
We also had made a detailed investigation of phoneme-statistics 
about the different etymological strata of the root-words (with the 
oDl~ 1204 machine of the Kossuth Lajos University, programmed 
by P. J6kel), and then also placed the different etymological layers in 
a 66 dimension space depicting the phonemes. The multi-dimensional 
space proved to be very manageable. Besides revealing trivial truths 
such as " i t  is the layer of the inner, Hungarian developments hat is 
19 
290 r~RENC PAI'P 
nearest o the Finno-Ugrian layer ", or "the Latin and Neo-Latin 
layers are the farthest ones from the Finno-Ugrian layer ", it gave 
about these distances certain valuable quantitative indices as well on 
the basis of which the model could be applied to other fields where 
indeed it has already brought really new results (cf. 2.1.2). 
2. We have prepared natural Hungarian texts as well for automatic 
processing. At the time of writing, a text of half a million phonemes 
(the complete poetic works of E. Ady), has already undergone the 
description set out below; further texts of similar size from the complete 
works of 20th century and earlier Hungarian poets will be put into 
the machine in the near future. The general aim of this work is naturally 
to have a thoroughly controlled, uniformly punched Hungarian text- 
store consisting of millions or tens of millions of phonemes. A com- 
putational text-store like that can serve as the basis of automatic proc- 
essings of different levels and of concrete purposes. In the following 
some of these will be described; especially the one that has already 
been most fully realized. 
2.1. These texts have been processed first on the level of pho- 
nemes. For this purpose a program has been made that 
a) changes texts written with present-day Hungarian orthog- 
raphy from letters into phonemes; 
b) identifies and counts the phonemes, produces tabular and 
other indices from them as outputs; 
c) places the different texts in a multi-dimensional space according 
to the results measured alongside the phonemes, and measures their 
distances observed in this space. 
In the following we illustrate by only a few examples what we 
expect from a processing like this and what we have already got from it. 
2.1.1. A thorough phoneme-statistical work done on a much lar- 
ger corpus that the previous ones might disprove certain prejudices. 
So it has been a fairly widespread belief that a large proportion of 
vowels in a text is beautiful. (In connection with this e. g. the Italian 
language is often praised for its high ratio of vowels). In respect of at 
least the examined Hungarian texts, however, it has turned out that 
the proportion of vowels depends on the average length of the run- 
ning words: the longer words are more vocalic than the shorter ones; 
AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN TEXTS 291 
therefore the poetic texts containing naturally more short words are 
less vocalic than the different echnical texts. 
2.1.2. We have been measuring the distances of the different exts 
in the multi-dimensional space. Up to the present our most valuable 
result is that the first juvenile volume of the above-mentioned E. Ady, 
which Hungarian l i terati  and aestheticians consider not to be charac-. 
teristic of the later poet, is really so far from the other volumes, from 
his oeuvre  - specifically as regards its tone, that it has to be stated from 
a pure mathematical aspect also that it takes place in quite a different 
part of space non-characteristic of the author. The results we are expect- 
ing just now concern the relation of a poet's own poems and his transla- 
tions; what are the acoustic distances among his own volumes and transla- 
ted volumes of a poet who translated a lot and wrote a great number 
of poems of his own as well; what is the situation if he translated a 
rather bulky volume twice in his life. (That is what happened to the 
20th century L. Szab6 who translated Shakespeare's Sonnets  both at 
the beginning and towards the end of his poetic life: we are going to 
measure the distance of these two complete volumes from each-other, 
from the original Szab6-volumes of the same periods, and from his 
other volumes of translations as well as from other contemporary 
Hungarian poets). 
2.2. The punched material may offer us even farther-reaching pos- 
sibilities for the near and the distant future. 
2.2.1. The easiest and most natural step forward will be to compile 
also sound-statistics after the phoneme-statistics, especially as there is 
an excellent theoretical preliminary study to it (J. Loxz, 1972), which 
has already been applied to the computer (T. Am~w~auT, A. Km~x, 
1972). 
2.2.2. Naturally we are going to advance towards the compila- 
tion of poetic concordance dictionaries as well as towards the morpho- 
logical and syntactical processing of the given material.
