Abstract 
This paper presents a dialogue system in 
the form of an ECA that acts as a socia-
ble and emotionally intelligent compan-
ion for the user. The system dialogue is 
not task-driven but is social conversation 
in which the user talks about his/her day 
at the office. During conversations the 
system monitors the emotional state of 
the user and uses that information to in-
form its dialogue turns. The system is 
able to respond to spoken interruptions 
by the user, for example, the user can in-
terrupt to correct the system. The system 
is already fully implemented and aspects 
of actual output will be used to illustrate. 
1 Introduction 
Historically, Embodied Conversational Agents 
(ECAs) have been used in research and industry 
make information and complex tasks more ac-
cessible to customers and users. With the rise of 
new technologies in affective dialogue systems, 
we are beginning to see a future in which ECA 
dialogues are not all task-driven, but some will 
be focused on the social aspects of conversation. 
We envisage the development of ECAs that en-
hance the social quality of life of the user, and 
that build deep relationships with their users over 
years of use. Our affective companion ECA is 
our first contribution to this emerging technol-
ogy.  
Our emotionally intelligent dialogue system 
requires a high level of understanding of the 
meaning of the user turns, and so is quite unlike 
a ?chatbot?. Affective aspects of the situation are 
also key in influencing the course of the conver-
sation. The system attempts to balance both se-
mantic and affective understanding in order to 
create an engaging and enjoyable companion for 
social conversation. 
2 Scenario description 
The system conversation is free-ranging and fol-
lows the user?s initiative, rather than being task-
driven. We have for the time being restricted the 
range of conversation topics to things that hap-
pen in the life of someone who works in an of-
fice (the ?How was your day?? (HWYD) sce-
nario). The user ?offloads? about his/her day at 
work by chatting to the ECA, and the ECA tries 
to empathise with and advise the user. The ECA 
asks questions to elicit information from the user, 
makes empathetic and sympathetic comments, 
and offers advice.  
The system is able to process long user turns, 
as well as to generate long system turns (around 
50 words). If the user perhaps dislikes what 
he/she hears, he/she can interrupt the system by 
barging in, and the ECA will respond in a hu-
man-like way. The conversation style is therefore 
considerably different from traditional task-based 
dialogues that consist of short dialogue turns and 
in which the system takes all the initiative.  
The dialogue in Table 1 (actual output from a 
user session) illustrates some of the significant 
features of the system, including long system 
277
turns, user interruptions and emotional analysis 
of user input.  
 
User1 Worst day ever. I arrived late be-
cause of the traffic. 
System1 You have my sympathy. What 
happened next? 
User2 I missed the meeting on project 
responsibilities; got more work 
dumped on me. Just what I don?t 
need. I?m already likely to miss 
the deadline. [ECA looks worried 
when user?s negative tone is de-
tected] 
System2 Sorry to hear that. Who was at the 
meeting? 
User3 Only my team. They gave me a 
set of PowerPoint slides from the 
meeting. I spent the rest of the day 
reading them but my computer 
kept crashing because of  updates. 
System3 Oh dear! It is understandable how 
you must be feeling. It?s right to 
be unhappy about such a bad situ-
ation. Try not to worry about 
missing the deadline because of 
the technical problems. [At this 
point user interrupts ECA by 
beginning turn User4] It?s sad that 
your motivation could be affected 
by them. [System stops speaking] 
User4 No, I?m not worried about the 
technical problems, I?m worried 
about the amount of extra work on 
this project and the deadline. 
System4 What is the project about?

3 Architecture 
Figure 1 shows a screen shot taken at run-time of 
actual system output. The ECA is represented on 
a screen as a woman (waist up) who displays 
natural, human-like movements and performs a 
wide range of complex facial expressions, bodily 
movements, and hand and arm gestures. 
The screen also displays a transcript of the 
user and system turns. The user turns shown con-
stitute the output of the Automatic Speech Rec-
ogniser (ASR). The system?s analysis of the 
user?s emotional state is also shown. 
The right-most panel of the screen shows 
graphics which convey real-time information 
about how the dialogue is being processed. It 
presents a streamlined view of the software 
modules that comprise the system. Module activ-
ity is visually represented at run-time by flashing 
colours. This ?glass-box? approach enables de-
tailed observation and analysis of system 
procedure at run-time. 
The system comprises a number of distinct 
modules that are connected using Inamode, a 
hub-based message-passing framework using 
XML formatted messages over plain text sock-
ets. 
The system?s ASR is the NuanceTM dictation 
engine. This is run in parallel with our own a-
coustic analysis pipeline which extracts low level 
(pitch, tone) speech features and also high-level 
features such as emotional characteristics. 
Analysis of the emotions is currently carried out 
 
Figure 1: Screenshot of the prototype interface

by EmoVoice (Vogt et al (2008)). The ASR 
output strings are analysed for sentiment by the 
AFFECTiS system (Moilanen and Pulman (2007, 
2009)) and classed as positive, neutral, or nega-
tive. This output is fused with the output from 
EmoVoice to generate a value that represents the 
user?s current emotional state, which is ex-
pressed as a valence+arousal pairing (with five 
possible values). 
The ASR output goes to our own Natural Lan-
guage Understanding (NLU) module which per-
forms syntactic and semantic analysis of user 
utterances and derives noun phrases and verb 
groups and associated arguments. Events rele-
vant to the scenario (e.g., promotions, redundan-
cies, meetings, arguments, etc.) are recognised 
by the NLU and are used to populate an ontology 
(a model of the conversation content).  The sys-
tem is currently able to recognize and respond to 
more than 30 event types.  
The events recognised in a user turn are 
labelled with the output of the Emotion Module 
for that turn; the result is a representation of both 
the semantic and affective information that the 
user might be trying to convey. 
Our own rule-based Dialogue Manager (DM) 
takes the affect-annotated semantic output of the 
NLU, and from that and its model of the conver-
sation content determines the next system turn. It 
will either ask a question about the events that 
occurred in the user?s day, express an opinion on 
the events already described, or make empathetic 
comments. Whenever the system has gained suf-
ficient understanding of a key event in the user?s 
day, it generates a complex long turn that encap-
sulates comfort, opinion, warnings and advice to 
the user. 
These long system turns are generated by our 
own plan-based Affective Strategy Module that 
makes an appraisal of the user?s situation and  
generates an appropriate emotional strategy 
(Cavazza et al (2010)). This strategy?expressed 
as an abstract, conceptual representation?is han-
ded to our own Natural Language Generator 
(NLG) that maps it into a series of linguistic sur-
face forms (usually 4 or 5 sentences). We use a 
style-controllable system using Tree-Furcating 
Grammars (an extension of the Tree-Adjoining 
Grammars formalism (Joshi et al (1997)). This 
ensures the generation of a large set of different 
surface forms from the same semantic input. 
The output of the NLG is passed to a module 
that adds this information to its system turn 
instructions for the ECA. The ECA has been de-
veloped around the HaptekTM toolkit and is con-
trolled using an FML-like language (after 
Hern?ndez et al (2008)). This 2-D embodiment 
produces gestures, facial expressions, and body 
movements that convey the emotional state of 
the ECA. Its movements and expressions enable 
it to visually display interest and enjoyment in 
talking to the user, and to display empathy with 
the user. The speech synthesis module is our own 
emotion-focused extension of the LoquendoTM 
TTS system. It includes paralinguistic elements 
such as exclamations and laughter, and emo-
tional prosody generation for negative and posi-
tive utterances. 
4 Special procedural features 
A significant processing design feature of the 
system is that there are two main processing 
loops from user input to system output; a ?long 
loop? which passes through all the components 
of the system; and a ?short loop? or ?feedback 
loop? which will now be discussed (the proce-
dure already described in Section 3 is the long 
loop procedure). 
4.1 Feedback loop 
The feedback loop (?short loop?) bypasses many 
linguistic components and generates immediate 
reactions to user activity. The main function of 
the short loop is maintain user engagement by 
preventing unnaturally long gaps of ECA inactiv-
ity. The feedback loop engages the acoustic 
analysis components, the TTS, and the ECA. It is 
responsible for the generation of real-time (< 500 
ms) reactions in the ECA in response to the emo-
tional state of the user. It attempts to align  both 
verbal behaviour (backchannelling) and non-
verbal behaviour (facial expressions, gestures, 
and general body language) to the emotions de-
tected during most recent user turn. In order to 
achieve a reasonable level of realism, these sys-
tem reactions to the perceived emotional state of 
the user need to be perceptibly instantaneous. 
Using this short feedback loop that bypasses 
many of the linguistic components ensures this. 
The feedback loop is also occasionally used to 
make sympathetic comments immediately after 
the user stops speaking. These act as acknowl-
edgements of the emotion expressed by the user. 
An example can be seen in the System2 turn of 
the example dialogue in Table 1: 
1.?Sorry to hear that. Who was at the meeting?? 
Here, the first utterance was spoken by the sys-
tem within a few tenths of a second after the end 
279
of the previous user turn (User2). The system 
tried to identify the user?s emotion in the previ-
ous turn and then to behave linguistically and 
visually in an empathetic way. The actual sympa-
thetic utterance was randomly chosen from a set 
of ?negative emotion utterances? (there are also 
?positive? and ?neutral? sets).  
The second half of the system turn in (1) was 
derived by the system?s ?long loop?. It is a ques-
tion which refers to a meeting that the user men-
tioned in the previous turn. This ?meeting? event 
has been heard by the ASR, understood by the 
NLU system, remembered by the DM, and is 
now referred to by an appropriate definite noun 
phrase in the output of the NLG.   
The feedback and main loops run in parallel. 
However, the feedback loop generates its speech 
output almost immediately, giving time for the 
main dialogue loop to complete its more detailed 
analysis of the user?s utterance.  
4.2 Handling user interruptions 
This system has a complex strategy for handling 
situations in which the user interrupts long 
system turns.  The system?s response to ?barge-
in? user interruptions is overseen by the Interrup-
tion Manager (IM), which is alerted by the 
acoustic input modules whenever a genuine user 
interruption (as opposed to, say, a backchannel) 
is detected during a long system utterance. When 
alerted, the IM instructs the ECA to stop speak-
ing when it reaches a natural stopping point in its 
current turn (usually the end of the current 
phrase). The user?s interruption utterance is 
processed by the long loop. Its progress is 
tracked and controlled by the IM, for example, it 
makes sure that the linguistic modules know that 
the current utterance is an interruption, whic 
means it requires special treatment. The DM has 
a range of strategies for system recoveries from 
user interruptions, including different ways of 
continuing, replanning, and aborting. An exam-
ple of a user interruption is shown in Table 1. 
The user interrupts the long system utterance in 
the System3 turn. The system?s response to the 
interruption is to stop the speech output from the 
ECA, abort the long system turn altogether, and 
instead to ask for more details about the project 
that the user has just mentioned during the inter-
ruption. (See (Crook et al (2010))  for a more 
detailed description of the IM.)
