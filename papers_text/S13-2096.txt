Abstract
In this paper the UNITOR-HMM-TK system
participating in the Spatial Role Labeling
task at SemEval 2013 is presented. The
spatial roles classification is addressed as a
sequence-based word classification problem:
the SVMhmm learning algorithm is applied,
based on a simple feature modeling and a ro-
bust lexical generalization achieved through a
Distributional Model of Lexical Semantics. In
the identification of spatial relations, roles are
combined to generate candidate relations, later
verified by a SVM classifier. The Smoothed
Partial Tree Kernel is applied, i.e. a con-
volution kernel that enhances both syntactic
and lexical properties of the examples, avoid-
ing the need of a manual feature engineering
phase. Finally, results on three of the five tasks
of the challenge are reported.
1 Introduction
Referring to objects or entities in the space, as well
as to relations holding among them, is one of the
most important functionalities in natural language
understanding. The detection of spatial utterances
thus finds many applications, such as in GPS navi-
gation systems, or Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
In Computational Linguistics, the task of recog-
nizing spatial information is known as Spatial Role
Labeling (SpRL), as discussed in (KordJamshidi et
al., 2010). Let us consider the sentence:
[A man]TRAJECTOR is sitting [on]SPATIAL INDICATOR
[a chair]LANDMARK and talking on the phone. (1)
where three roles are labeled: the phrase ?A man?
refers to a TRAJECTOR, ?a chair? to a LAND-
MARK and they are related by the spatial expres-
sion ?on? denoted as SPATIAL INDICATOR. The
last role establishes the type of the spatial relation,
e.g. Regional. The ambiguity of natural language
makes this task very challenging. For example, in
the same Example 1, another preposition ?on? can
be considered, but the phrase ?the phone? is not a
spatial role, as it refers to a communication mean.
This mainly depends on the semantics of the gram-
matical head words, i.e. chair and phone. Such phe-
nomena are crucial in many learning frameworks,
as in kernel-based learning (Shawe-Taylor and Cris-
tianini, 2004), where the decision is based on the
similarity between training and testing data.
This paper describes the UNITOR-HMM-TK sys-
tem participating in the Semeval 2013 Spatial Role
Labeling Task (Kolomiyets et al, 2013), addressing
three of the five defined sub-tasks:
? Task A: Spatial Role Classification. It con-
sists in labeling short sentences with spatial
roles among SPATIAL INDICATOR, TRAJEC-
TOR and LANDMARK.
? Task B: Relation Identification. It consists in
the identification of relations among roles iden-
tified in Task A. This task does not involve the
semantic relation classification.
? Task C: Spatial Role Classification. It con-
sists in labeling short documents with spa-
tial roles among the extended role set: TRA-
JECTOR, LANDMARK, SPATIAL INDICATOR,
MOTION INDICATOR, PATH, DIRECTION and
DISTANCE.
The UNITOR-HMM-TK system addresses both the
problems of identifying spatial roles and relations as
a sequence of two main classification steps.
573
In the first step, each word in the sentence is
classified by a sequence-based classifier with re-
spect to the possible spatial roles. It is in line
with other methods based on sequence-based clas-
sifier for SpRL (Kordjamshidi et al, 2011; Kord-
jamshidi et al, 2012b). Our labeling has been in-
spired by the work in (Croce et al, 2012), where
the SVMhmm learning algorithm, formulated in (Al-
tun et al, 2003), has been applied to the classi-
cal FrameNet-based Semantic Role Labeling. The
main contribution in (Croce et al, 2012) is the adop-
tion of shallow grammatical features (e.g. POS-
tag sequences) instead of the full syntax of the sen-
tence, in order to avoid over-fitting over training
data. Moreover, lexical information has been gen-
eralized through the use of a Word Space, in line
with (Schutze, 1998; Sahlgren, 2006): it consists
in a Distributional Model of Lexical Semantics de-
rived from the unsupervised analysis of an unla-
beled large-scale corpus. The result is a geometri-
cal space where words with similar meaning, e.g.
involved in a paradigmatic or almost-synonymic re-
lations, will be projected in similar vectors. As an
example, we expect that a word like ?table?, maybe
a LANDMARK in a training example, is more similar
to ?chair? as compared with ?phone?.
In the second step, all roles found in a sentence are
combined to generate candidate relations, which are
then verified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier. As the entire sentence is informative to de-
termine the proper conjunction of all roles, we apply
a kernel function within the classifier, that enhances
both syntactic and lexical information of the exam-
ples. We adopted the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel
(SPTK), defined in (Croce et al, 2011): it is con-
volution kernel that allows to measure the similar-
ity between syntactic structures, which are partially
similar and whose nodes can differ, but are semanti-
cally related. Each example is represented as a tree
structure directly derived from the sentence depen-
dency parse, thus avoiding the manual definition of
features. Similarity between lexical nodes is mea-
sured in the same Word Space mentioned above.
In the rest of the paper, Section 2 discusses the
SVMhmm based approach. The SPTK-based learn-
ing algorithm will be presented in Section 3. Finally,
results obtained in the competition are discussed in
Section 4.
2 Sequential Tagging for Spatial Role
Classification
The system proposed for the Spatial Role Classi-
fication task is based on the SVMhmm formula-
tion discussed in (Altun et al, 2003). It extends
classical SVMs by learning a discriminative model
isomorphic to a k-order Hidden Markov Model
through the Structural SVM formulation (Tsochan-
taridis et al, 2005). In the discriminative view
of SVMhmm, given an observed input word se-
quence x = (x1 . . . xl) ? X of feature vectors
x1 . . . xl, the model predicts a sequence of labels
y = (y1 . . . yl) ? Y after learning a linear discrim-
inant function F : X ? Y ? R over input/output
pairs. Each word is then modeled as a set of linear
features that express lexical information as well as
syntactic information surrogated by POS n-grams.
With respect to other works using SVMhmm for
SpRL, such as (Kordjamshidi et al, 2012b), we in-
vestigate another set of possible features, as the ones
proposed in (Croce et al, 2012): the aim is to pro-
vide an agile system that takes advantages in adopt-
ing only shallow grammatical features, thus ignoring
the full syntactic information of a sentence. The syn-
tactic features derived from a dependency parse pro-
cess are surrogated by POS n-grams. According to
this, our feature modeling adopts the IOB notation
discussed in (Croce et al, 2012). It provides a class
label for each token, mapping them into artificial
classes representing the beginning (B), the inside (I)
or ending (O) of a spatial role, plus the label of the
classified role (i.e. BSPIND for the starting token of a
SPATIAL INDICATOR); words external to every role
are labeled with the special class ( ). According to
this notation, the labeling of Example 1 can be ex-
pressed as follows: ?A/BTRAJ man/OTRAJ is/ sitting/
on/BSPIND a/BLAND chair/OLAND and/ . . . ?.
In order to reduce the complexity of the entire
classification task, two phases are applied. In Task
A, as in (Kordjamshidi et al, 2011), the first phase
aims at labeling only SPATIAL INDICATOR, as they
should relate remaining spatial expressions. For the
same reason, in Task C we first label only SPA-
TIAL INDICATOR and MOTION INDICATOR. Roles
classified in this step are considered pivot and they
can be used as features for the classification of the
other roles: TRAJECTORS and LANDMARKS for
574
Task A while TRAJECTORS, LANDMARKS, PATHS,
DISTANCES and DIRECTIONS for Task C.
For the classification of SPATIAL and MOTION
INDICATOR, each word, such as the first ?on? occur-
rence in the Example 1, is modeled through the fol-
lowing features: its lemma (on) and POS tag (IN);
the left and right lexical contexts, represented by the
n words before (man::NN is::VBZ sitting::VBG) and
after (a::DT chair::NN and::CC); the left and right
syntactic contexts as the POS n-grams occurring be-
fore (i.e. NN VBZ VBZ VBG NN VBZ VBG) and
after (i.e. DT NN NN CC DT NN CC) the word.
For the TRAJECTOR and LANDMARK classifica-
tion in Task A, each word is represented by the same
features described above, plus the following ones
(with respect to Example 1, the token relative to
the word man): lemma of the SPATIAL INDICATOR
(on); Positional Feature: distance from the SPATIAL
INDICATOR in terms of number of tokens (-3); rel-
ative position with respect to the SPATIAL INDICA-
TOR, that is before or after (before); a boolean fea-
ture that indicates whether or not the current token is
a SPATIAL INDICATOR; the number of words com-
posing the SPATIAL INDICATOR (here 1).
In Task C, for the classification with respect to
the complete set of roles, each word is modeled by
the previous features together with the following:
distance from the MOTION INDICATOR in terms
of number of tokens; relative position with respect
to the MOTION INDICATOR (before and after); a
boolean feature that indicates whether or not the cur-
rent token is a MOTION INDICATOR; the number of
words that composes the MOTION INDICATOR. In
both Tasks A and C the symbols SI and MI to rep-
resent a SPATIAL INDICATOR or a MOTION INDI-
CATOR are used respectively to represent the target
pivot role within any n-gram.
In order to increase the robustness of our model-
ing, we extended the lexical information with fea-
tures derived from a distributional analysis over
large texts. In essence, we represent the lexical se-
mantic similarity between different words with sim-
ilar meaning. We extend a supervised approach
through the adoption of vector based models of lex-
ical meaning: a large-scale corpus is statistically an-
alyzed and a Word Space, (Sahlgren, 2006), is ac-
quired as follows. A word-by-context matrix M
is obtained through a large scale corpus analysis.
Then the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and
Dumais, 1997) technique is applied to reduce the
space dimensionality. Moreover it provides a way
to project a generic word wi into a k-dimensional
space where each row corresponds to the representa-
tion vector ~wi. In such a space, the distance between
vectors reflects the similarity between correspond-
ing words. The resulting feature vector representing
wi is then augmented with ~wi, as in (Croce et al,
2010), where the benefits of such information have
been reported in the FrameNet-based Semantic Role
Labeling task.
3 Relation identification
The UNITOR-HMM-TK system tackles Relation Iden-
tification task by determining which spatial roles,
discovered in the previous classification phase, can
be combined to determine valid spatial relations.
Our method is inspired by the work of (Roberts and
Harabagiu, 2012), where all possible spatial roles
are first generated through heuristics and then com-
binatorially combined to acquire candidate relations;
valid spatial relations are finally determined using a
SVM classifier. We aim at reducing the potentially
huge search space, by considering only spatial roles
proposed by our sequential tagging approach, de-
scribed in Section 2. Most importantly, we avoid the
manual feature engineering phase of (Roberts and
Harabagiu, 2012). Candidate relations are not rep-
resented as vectors, whose dimensions are manually
defined features useful for the target classification.
We directly apply the Smoothed Partial Tree-Kernel
(SPTK), proposed in (Croce et al, 2011), to estimate
the similarity among a specific tree representation.
Tree kernels exploit syntactic similarity through
the idea of convolutions among substructures.
Any tree kernel computes the number of common
substructures between two trees T1 and T2 without
explicitly considering the whole fragment space. Its
general equation is reported hereafter:
TK(T1, T2) =
?
n1?NT1
?
n2?NT2
?(n1, n2)
where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of the T1?s and
T2?s nodes respectively, and ?(n1, n2) is equal to
the number of common fragments rooted in the n1
and n2 nodes1. The SVM classifier is thus trained in
1To have a similarity score between 0 and 1, a normalization
575
a implicit very high-dimensional space, where each
dimension reflects a possible tree sub-structure, thus
avoiding the need of an explicit feature definition.
The function ? determines the nature of such space.
For example, Syntactic Tree Kernel (STK) are used
to model complete context free rules as in (Collins
and Duffy, 2001).
The algorithm for SPTK (Croce et al, 2011)
pushes for more emphasis on lexical nodes. The
? function allows to recursively matches tree struc-
tures and lexical nodes: this allows to match frag-
ments having same structure but different lexical
nodes, by assigning a score proportional to the
product of the lexical similarities, thus generalizing
grammatical and lexical information in training data.
While similarity can be modeled directly over lexi-
cal resources, e.g. WordNet as discussed in (Peder-
sen et al, 2004), their development can be very ex-
pensive, thus limiting the coverage of the resulting
convolution kernel, especially in specific application
domains. Again, a Word Space model is adopted:
given two words, the term similarity function ? is
estimated as the cosine similarity between the corre-
sponding projections.
As proposed in (Croce et al, 2011), the SPTK is
applied to examples modeled according the Gram-
matical Relation Centered Tree (GRCT) representa-
tion, which is derived from the original dependency
parse structure. Figure 1 shows the GRCT for Exam-
ple 1: non-terminal nodes reflect syntactic relations,
such as subject (NSUBJ); pre-terminals are the POS,
such as nouns (NN), and leaves are lexemes, such as
man::n2. Non-terminal nodes associated with a role
are enriched with the role name, e.g. NSUBJTRAJ.
All nodes not covering any role are pruned out, so
that all information not concerning spatial aspects
that would introduce noise is ignored.
In this setting, positive examples are provided by
considering sentences labeled by roles involved in
a valid relation. The definition of negative exam-
ples is more difficult. We considered all roles la-
belled by the SVMhmm based system, discussed in
Section 2. For each incorrect labeling over the an-
in the kernel space, i.e. TK(T1,T2)?
TK(T1,T1)?TK(T2,T2)
is applied.
2Each word is lemmatized to reduce data sparseness, but
they are enriched with POS tags to avoid confusing words from
different grammatical categories.

notated material, a set of negative examples is ac-
quired by combining all proposed roles. In order
to avoid over-fitting, a n-fold schema has been ap-
plied: it is needed to avoid the SVMhmm label-
ing the same sentences used for training. More-
over, constraints over the relation are imposed to
avoid violations of the Spatial Role theory: in
Task B each relation must be composed at least by
a SPATIAL INDICATOR, LANDMARK and a TRA-
JECTOR or by a SPATIAL INDICATOR, implicit
LANDMARK and a TRAJECTOR. Let us consider
a possible labeling of Example 1: ?[A man]TRAJ
is sitting [on]SPIND [a chair]LAND and talking
[on]SPIND[the phone]LAND?; here, the second SPA-
TIAL INDICATOR ?on? and the LANDMARK ?the
phone? are incorrectly labeled. A negative example
is thus obtained by considering these roles togheter
with the TRAJECTOR ?the phone?, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. Other two negative examples can be generated
by combining the remaining two roles.
4 Results
In this section experimental results of the
UNITOR-HMM-TK system in the Spatial Role
Labeling task at SemEval 2013 are reported. In
Tasks A and B, the dataset is a corrected version
576
of the same training dataset employed in (Kord-
jamshidi et al, 2012a)3. The dataset for Task C was
part of the Confluence corpus4. More details about
the dataset are provided in (Kolomiyets et al, 2013).
In all experiments, sentences are processed with the
Stanford CoreNLP5, for Part-of-Speech tagging,
lemmatization (Task A and C) and dependency
parsing (Task B).
The sequential labeling system described in Sec-
tion 2 has been made available by the SVMhmm
software6. The estimation of the semantically
Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (SPTK), described in
Section 3 is made available by an extended ver-
sion of SVM-LightTK software7 (Moschitti, 2006),
implementing the smooth matching between tree
nodes. Similarity between lexical nodes is estimated
as the cosine similarity in the co-occurrence Word
Space described above, as in (Croce et al, 2011).
The co-occurrence Word Space is acquired
through the distributional analysis of the UkWaC
corpus (Baroni et al, 2009). First, all words oc-
curring more than 100 times (i.e. the targets) are
represented through vectors. The original space di-
mensions are generated from the set of the 20,000
most frequent words (i.e. features) in the UkWaC
corpus. One dimension describes the Pointwise Mu-
tual Information score between one feature, as it oc-
curs on a left or right window of 3 tokens around a
target. Left contexts of targets are treated differently
from the right ones, in order to capture asymmetric
syntactic behaviors (e.g., useful for verbs): 40,000
dimensional vectors are thus derived for each tar-
get. The Singular Value Decomposition is applied
and the space dimensionality is reduced to k = 100.
4.1 Results in Task A
Two different runs were submitted for Task A. The
first takes into account all roles labeled accordingly
to the approach described in Section 2. Results, in
term of precision, recall and F-measure for each spa-
tial role are shown in Table 1. The second run con-
siders only those roles composing the relations that

after the elimination of 21 duplicated sentences.

are positively classified in Task B and it will be dis-
cussed in Section 4.2.
A tuning phase has been carried out through a 10-
fold cross validation: it allowed to find the best clas-
sifier parameters. The evaluation of the system per-
formances is measured using a character based mea-
sure, i.e. considering the number of characters in the
span that overlap a role in the gold-standard test.
Spatial Role Precision Recall F-Measure
SPATIAL INDICATOR 0.967 0.889 0.926
TRAJECTOR 0.684 0.681 0.682
LANDMARK 0.741 0.835 0.785
Table 1: Task A results (first run)
The overall performances of the first run are
very promising in terms of both precision and re-
call. In particular, the SPATIAL INDICATOR label-
ing achieves a significant F-Measure of 0.926 with a
precision of 0.967. The sequence labeling approach
provides good results for the LANDMARK and the
TRAJECTOR roles too. Unfortunately, these results
are not comparable with the performances obtained
the last year edition of the SpRL task, where a gram-
matical head word-based measure has been applied.
The main difficulty in the SPATIAL INDICATOR
classification concerns the tagging of a larger or
smaller span for the roles, as for ?at the back? that is
tagged as ?at the back of?. On the contrary, for roles
like ?to the left and the right? the system produces a
tag covering just the first three words, ?to the left?,
because this shortest sequence was far more repre-
sented within the training set. Some roles corre-
sponding to unknown word sequences, such as ?on
the very right?, were not labeled, leading to the little
drop in terms of recall for the SPATIAL INDICATOR.
Another issue in the TRAJECTOR and LAND-
MARK labeling is due to the absence of specific role
sequences in the training set, such as LANDMARK-
TRAJECTOR-SPATIAL INDICATOR labeled in the
test sentence ?there is a [coffee table]LANDMARK with
a [sofa]TRAJECTOR [around]SP.IND?: the SVMhmm
classifier in fact tends to discard any sequence un-
seen during training. Another issue concerns the
difficulty in assigning the TRAJECTOR role to the
proper SPATIAL INDICATOR: in the sentence ?a
bench with a person lying on it? where both ?a
bench? and ?a person? are tagged as TRAJECTOR.
577
4.2 Results in Task B
Task B has been tackled using the SPTK-based Re-
lation Identification approach, described in Section
3. In particular, the SVM classifier is fed with 741
positive examples, corresponding to the number of
gold relations, while the negative examples genera-
tion process, described in Section 3, yielded 2,256
examples. The same Word Space described in the
previous section has been used to compute the se-
mantic similarity within the SPTK. For the tuning
phase, a 80-20 fixed split has been applied.
For this task, two different measures are pre-
sented. The Relaxed measure considers a relation
correct if each role composing it has at least one
character overlapping the corresponding gold role.
The Strict measure considers a relation correct only
if each role in it has all the characters overlapping
with the gold role. The first measure is more com-
parable with the one used in (Kordjamshidi et al,
2012a), where a relation is considered correct only
if each grammatical head word of the involved roles
were correctly labeled. The results achieved in this
task by our system are reported in Table 2.
Spatial Role Precision Recall F-Measure
RELAXED 0.551 0.391 0.458
STRICT 0.431 0.306 0.358
Table 2: Task B results
The problem for this task is more challenging. In
fact, the overall task is strictly biased by the quality
of the SVMhmm based classifier and inherits all the
limitations underlined in Section 4.2. This mostly
affects the recall, because every error generated dur-
ing the role classification is cumulative and losing
only one role in Task A implies a misclassification
of the whole relation. However, it is important to
notice that these results have been achieved without
any manual feature engineering nor any heuristics or
hand coded lexical resource.
Spatial Role Precision Recall F-Measure
SPATIAL INDICATOR 0.968 0.585 0.729
TRAJECTOR 0.682 0.493 0.572
LANDMARK 0.801 0.560 0.659
Table 3: Task A results (second run)
In the second run of Task A, we evaluate the con-
tribution of this syntactic information to filter out
roles. In Table 3 results of the second run for Task
A are reported (see previous Section). As expected,
the recall measure shows a performance drop with
respect to results shown in Table 1: the results pro-
posed in the first run represents an upperbound to the
recall as any novel role is added here. However, the
precision measure for the LANDMARK role classifi-
cation is improved of about 10%.
Spatial Role Precision Recall F-Measure
SPATIAL INDICATOR 0.609 0.479 0.536
MOTION INDICATOR 0.892 0.294 0.443
TRAJECTOR 0.565 0.317 0.406
LANDMARK 0.662 0.476 0.554
PATH 0.775 0.295 0.427
DIRECTION 0.312 0.229 0.264
DISTANCE 0.946 0.331 0.490
Table 4: Task C results
4.3 Results in Task C
In Task C the extended set of roles is considered.
According to this, the number of possible labels to
be learnt by the system increases, thus making the
problem more challenging. As for Task A, here the
SVMhmm has been trained over the whole training
set, using a 10-fold cross validation in the tuning
phase. Moreover, the sentences of the Confluence
corpus are far more complex than the ones from the
CLEF corpus. Confluence sentences have a more
narrative nature with respect to the CLEF sentences,
that are simple description of images. The combina-
tion of these two factors resulted in a large drop in
the performance, especially for the recall.
As shown by the results in Table 4, DIRECTION
is the most difficult role to be classified, probably
because it is represented by many different word se-
quences. Other roles are found in few instances, but
almost all correct, as for DISTANCE and MOTION
INDICATOR. The high value of Precision for the
DISTANCE role is justified by the fact that when this
role is composed by a number, (i.e. ?530 meters?),
the system identified and classified it well, while for
a representation with only words (i.e. ?very close?)
the system did not retrieved it at all.
