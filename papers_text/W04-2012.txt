Abstract
Answer validation is a component of question
answering system, which selects reliable answer
from answer candidates extracted by certain
methods. In this paper, we propose an approach
of answer validation based on the strengths of
lexical association between the keywords ex-
tracted from a question sentence and each an-
swer candidate. The proposed answer valida-
tion process is decomposed into two steps: the
first is to extract appropriate keywords from a
question sentence using word features and the
strength of lexical association, while the second
is to estimate the strength of the association
between the keywords and an answer candidate
based on the hits of search engines. In the re-
sult of experimental evaluation, we show that a
good proportion (79%) of a multiple-choice quiz
?Who wants to be a millionaire? can be solved
by the proposed method.
1 Introduction
The technology of searching for the answer of
a question written in natural language is called
?Question Answering?(QA), and has gotten a
lot of attention recently. Research activities of
QA have been promoted through competitions
such as TREC QA Track (Voorhees, 2004) and
NTCIR QAC (Fukumoto et al, 2004). Ques-
tion answering systems can be decomposed into
two steps: first step is to collect answer can-
didates, while the second is to validate each of
those candidates. The first step of collecting an-
swer candidates has been well studied so far. Its
standard technology is as follows: first, the an-
swer type of a question, such as LOCATION or
PERSON, is identified. Then, the documents
which may contain answer candidates are re-
trieved by querying available document set with
queries generated from the question sentence.
Finally, named entities which match the answer
type of the question sentence are collected from
the retrieved documents as answer candidates.
In this paper, we focus on the second step of
how to validate an answer candidate. Several
answer validation methods have been proposed.
One of the well-known approaches is that based
on deep understanding of text (e.g. Moldovan
et al (2003)). In the approach of answer valida-
tion based on deep understanding, first a ques-
tion and the paragraph including an answer can-
didate are parsed and transformed into logical
forms. Second, the validity of the answer candi-
date is examined through logical inference. One
drawback of this approach is that it requires a
rich set of lexical knowledge such as WordNet
and world knowledge such as the inference rule
set. Consequently, this approach is computa-
tionally expensive. In contrast, in this paper,
we propose another approach of answer vali-
dation, which is purely based on the estima-
tion of the strengths of lexical association be-
tween the keywords extracted from a question
sentence and each answer candidate. One un-
derlying motivation of this paper is to exam-
ine the effectiveness of quite low level semantic
operation such as measuring lexical association
against knowledge rich NLP tasks such as an-
swer validation of question answering. Surpris-
ingly, as we show later, given multiple-choices as
answer candidates of a question, a good propor-
tion of a certain set of questions can be solved
by our method based on lexical association.
In our framework of answer validation by key-
word association (in the remaining of this paper,
we call the notion of the lexical association in-
troduced above as ?keyword association?), the
answer validation process is decomposed into
two steps: the first step is to extract appro-
priate keywords from a question sentence, while
the second step is to estimate the strength of
the association between the keywords and an
answer candidate. We propose two methods for
the keyword selection step: one is by a small
number of hand-crafted rules for determining
word weights based on word features, while the
other is based on search engine hits. In the sec-
ond step of how to validate an answer candidate,
the web is used as a knowledge base for estimat-
ing the strength of the association between the
extracted keywords and an answer candidate.
Its basic idea is as follows: the stronger the as-
sociation between the keywords and an answer
candidate, the more frequently they co-occur on
the web. In this paper, we introduce several
measures for estimating the strength of the as-
sociation, and show their effectiveness through
experimental evaluation.
In this paper, in order to concentrate on the
issue of answer validation, but not the whole QA
processes, we use an existing multiple-choice
quiz as the material for our study. The multiple-
choice quiz we used is taken from ?Who wants to
be a millionaire?. ?Who wants to be a million-
aire? is a famous TV show, which originated in
the United Kingdom and has been localized in
more than fifty countries. We used the Japanese
version, which is produced by Fuji Television
Network, Inc.. In the experimental evaluation,
about 80% of the questions of this quiz can be
solved by the proposed method of answer vali-
dation by keyword association.
Section 2 introduces the idea of question an-
swering by keyword association. Section 3 de-
scribes how to select keywords from a question
sentence. Section 4 describes how to select the
answer of multiple-choice questions. Section 5
describes how to integrate the procedures of
keyword selection and answer selection. Sec-
tion 6 presents the results of experimental eval-
uations. Section 7 compares our work with sev-
eral related works Section 8 presents our con-
clusion and future works.
2 Answer Validation by Keyword
Association
2.1 Keyword Association
Here is an example of the multiple-choice quiz.
Q1: Who is the director of ?American Graffiti??
a: George Lucas
b: Steven Spielberg
c: Francis Ford Coppola
d: Akira Kurosawa
Suppose that you do not know the correct an-
swer and try to find it using a search engine
on the Web. The simplest way is to input the
query ?American Graffiti? to the search engine
and skim the retrieved pages. This strategy as-
sumes that the correct answer may appear on
the page that includes the keyword ?American
Graffiti?. A little cleverer way is to consider the
number of pages that contain both the keyword
and a choice. This number can be estimated
Table 1: Hits of Keywords and the Choices for
the Question Q1 (X:?American Graffiti?)
Y (choice) hits(X and Y )
?George Lucas? 15,500
?Steven Spielberg? 5,220
?Francis Ford Coppola? 4,800
?Akira Kurosawa? 836
from the hits of a search engine when you in-
put a conjunct query ?American Graffiti? and
?George Lucas?. Based on this assumption, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that the choice which
has the largest hits is the answer. For the above
question Q1, this strategy works. Table 1 shows
the hits of the conjunct queries for each of the
choices. We used ?google1? as a search engine.
Here, let X be the set of keywords, Y be the
choice. Function hits is defined as follows.
hits(X) ? hits(x
1
AND x
2
AND ? ? ?AND x
n
)
where
X = {x
1
, x
2
, . . . , x
n
}
The conjunct query with ?George Lucas?, which
is the correct answer, returns the largest hits.
Here, the question Q1 can be regarded as a
question on the strength of association between
keyword and an choice, and converted into the
following form.
Q1?: Select the one that has the strongest asso-
ciation with ?American Graffiti?.
a: George Lucas
b: Steven Spielberg
c: Francis Ford Coppola
d: Akira Kurosawa
We call this association between the keyword
and the choice as keyword association.
2.2 How to Select Keywords
It is important to select appropriate keywords
from a question sentence. Consider the follow-
ing question.
Q2: Who is the original author of the famous
movie ?Lord of the Rings??
a: Elijah Wood
b: JRR Tolkien
c: Peter Jackson
d: Liv Tyler
The numbers of hits are shown in Table 2. Here,
let X be ?Lord of the Rings?, X ? be ?Lord of the
1http://www.google.com
Table 2: Hits of Keywords and the Choices
for the Question Q2 (X:?Lord of the Rings?,
X ?:?Lord of the Rings? and ?original author?)
Y (choice) hits hits
(X and Y ) (X ? and Y )
?Elijah Wood? 682,000 213
?JRR Tolkien? 652,000 702
?Peter Jackson? 1,140,000 340
?Liv Tyler? 545,000 106
Rings? and ?original author?. When you select
the title of this movie ?Lord of the Rings? as a
keyword, the choice with the maximum hits is
?Peter Jackson?, which is not the correct an-
swer ?JRR Tolkien?. However, if you select
?Lord of the Rings? and ?original author? as
keywords, this question can be solved by select-
ing the choice with maximum hits. Therefore,
it is clear from this example that how to select
appropriate keywords is important.
2.3 Forward and Backward Association
For certain questions, it is not enough to gen-
erate a conjunct query consisting of some key-
words and a choice, and then to simply select
the choice with maximum hits. This section in-
troduces more sophisticated measures for select-
ing an appropriate answer. Consider the follow-
ing question.
Q3: Where is Pyramid?
a: Canada
b: Egypt
c: Japan
d: China
The numbers of hits are shown in Table 3. In
this case, given a conjunct query consisting of
a keyword ?Pyramid? and a choice, the choice
with the maximum hits, i.e., ?Canada? is not
the correct answer ?Egypt?. Why could not this
question be solved? Let us consider the hits of
the choices alone. The hits of the atomic query
?Canada? is about seven times larger than the
hits of the atomic query ?Egypt?. With this ob-
servation, we can hypothesize that the hits of a
conjunct query ?Pyramid? and a choice are af-
fected by the hits of the choice alone. Therefore
some normalization might be required.
Based on the analysis above, we employ the
metrics proposed by Sato and Sasaki (2003).
Sato and Sasaki (2003) has proposed two met-
rics for evaluating the strength of the relation
of two terms. Suppose that X be the set of
keywords and Y be the choice. In this paper,
we call the hits of a conjunct query consisting
of keywords X and a choice Y , which is nor-
malized by the hits of X, as forward association
FA(X, Y ). We also call the hits of a conjunct
query X and Y , which is normalized by the hits
of Y , as backward association BA(X, Y ).
FA(X, Y ) = hits(X ? {Y })/hits(X)
BA(X, Y ) = hits(X ? {Y })/hits({Y })
Note that when X is fixed, FA(X, Y ) is propor-
tional to hits(X ? {Y }).
Let?s go back to Q3. In this case, the choice
with the maximum BA is correct. Some ques-
tions may solved by referring to FA, while oth-
ers may be solved only by referring to BA.
Therefore, it is inevitable to invent a mecha-
nism which switches between FA and BA.
2.4 Summary
Based on the observation of Sections 2.1 ? 2.3,
the following three questions must be addressed
by answer validation based on keyword associ-
ation.
? How to select appropriate keywords from a
question sentence.
? How to identify the correct answer consid-
ering forward and/or backward association.
? How many questions can be solved by this
strategy based on keyword association.
3 Keyword Selection
This section describes two methods for selecting
appropriate keywords from a question sentence:
one is based on the features of each word, the
other based on hits of a search engine.
First, all the nouns are extracted from the
question sentence using a Japanese morpholog-
ical analyzer JUMAN(Kurohashi and Nagao,
1999) and a Japanese parser KNP(Kurohashi,
1998). Here, when the sequence of nouns con-
stitute a compound, only the longest compound
is extracted and their constituent nouns are not
extracted. Let N denote the set of those ex-
tracted nouns and compounds, from which key-
words are selected. In the following, the search
engine ?goo2? is used for obtaining the number
of hits.

China 53,600,000 225,000 0.0710 0.00420
3.1 Keyword Selection Based on Word
Features
In this method, keywords are selected by the
following procedure:
1. If the question sentence contains n quota-
tions with quotation marks ??? and ???,
those n quoted strings are selected as key-
words.
2. Otherwise:
2-1. According to the rules for word
weights in Table 4, weights are as-
signed to each element of the keyword
candidate set N .
2-2. Select the keyword candidate with the
maximum weight and that with the
second maximum weight.
2-3. i. If the hits of AND search of those
two keyword candidates are 15 or
more, both are selected as key-
words.
ii. Otherwise, select the one with the
maximum weight.
Let k denote the set of the selected keywords
(k ? N), we examine the correctness of k as
follows. Let c denote a choice, cF A
1
(k) the
choice with the maximum FA(k, c), and cBA
1
(k)
the choice with the maximum BA(k, c), respec-
tively.
cF A
1
(k) = argmax
c
FA(k, c)
c
BA
1
(k) = argmax
c
BA(k, c)
Here, we regard the selected keywords k to be
correct if either cF A
1
(k) or cBA
1
(k) is correct.
Against the development set which is to be in-
troduced in Section 6.1, the correct rate of the
keywords selected by the procedure above is
84.5%.

number of characters = 4 1.1

3.2 Keyword Selection Based on Hits
of Search Engine
3.2.1 Basic Methods
First, we introduce several basic methods for
selecting keywords based on hits of a search en-
gine. Let 2N denote the power set of N , where a
set of keywords k is an element of 2N (k ? 2N ).
Let k? denote the selected set of keywords and c?
the selected choice.
The first method is to simply select the pair
of ?k?, c?? which gives the maximum hits as below:
?k?, c?? = argmax
c, k?2
N
hits(k ? {c})
Against the development set, the correct rate of
the choice which is selected by this method is
35.7%.
In a similar way, another method which se-
lects the maximum FA or BA can be given as
below:
?k?, c?? = argmax
c, k?2
N
FA(k ? {c})
?k?, c?? = argmax
c, k?2
N
BA(k ? {c})
Their correct rates are 71.3% and 36.1%, respec-
tively.
3.2.2 Keyword Association Ratio
Next, we introduce more sophisticated meth-
ods which use the ratio of maximum and sec-
ond maximum associations such as FA or BA.
The underlying assumption of those methods
are that: the greater those ratios are, the more
reliable is the selected choice with the maximum
FA/BA. First, we introduce two methods: FA
ratio and BA ratio.
FA ratio This is the ratio of FA of the choice
with second maximum FA over one with maxi-
mum FA. FA ratio is calculated by the follow-
ing procedure.
1. Select the choices with maximum FA and
second maximum FA.
2. Estimate the correctness of the choice with
maximum FA by the ratio of their FAs.
The set k? of keywords and the choice c? to be
selected by FA ratio are expressed as below:
k? = argmin
k?2
N
FA(k, cF A
2
(k))
FA(k, cF A
1
(k))
c? = cF A
1
(k?)
c
F A
2
(k) = arg-secondmax
c
FA(k, c)
where arg-secondmax
c
is defined as a function
which selects c with second maximum value.
Similarly, the method based on BA ratio is
given as below:
BA ratio
k? = argmin
k?2
N
BA(k, cBA
2
(k))
BA(k, cBA
1
(k))
c? = cBA
1
(k?)
c
BA
2
(k) = arg-secondmax
c
BA(k, c)
Unlike the methods based on FA ratio and
BA ratio, the following two methods consider
both FA and BA. The motivation of those two
methods is to regard the decision by FA and
BA to be reliable if FA and BA agree on se-
lecting the choice.

Coverages and precisions of these four methods
against the development set are shown in Ta-
ble 5. Coverage is measured as the rate of ques-
tions for which the ratio is less than or equal to
13. Precisions are measured as the rate of ques-
tions for which the selected choice c? is the cor-
rect answer, over those covered questions. The
method having the greatest precision is BA ra-
tio with maximum and second maximum FA.
In the following sections, we use this ratio as
the keyword association ratio. Table 6 farther
examines the correlation of the range of the ra-
tio and the coverage/precision. When the ratio
is less than or equal to 0.25, about 60% of the
questions are solved with the precision close to
90%. This threshold of 0.25 is used in the Sec-
tion 5 when integrating the keyword association
ratio and word weights.
4 Answer Selection
In this section, we explain a method to identify
the correct answer considering forward and/or
backward association. After selecting keywords,
the following numbers are obtained by a search
engine.
? Hits of the keywords X: hits(X)
? Hits of the choice Y : hits({Y })
3For the ratios considering both FA and BA, the
ratio greater than 1 means that FA and BA disagree on
selecting the choice.

? 1 93.2% (828/888) 75.8% (628/828)
? Hits of the conjunct query:
hits(X ? {Y })
Then for each choice Y , FA and BA are cal-
culated. As introduced in section 3, cF A
1
(k) de-
notes the choice whose FA value is highest, and
cBA
1
(k) the choice whose BA value is highest.
What has to done here is to decide which of
cF A
1
(k) and cBA
1
(k) is correct.
After manually analyzing the search engine
hits against the development set, we hand-
crafted the following rules for switching between
cF A
1
(k) and cBA
1
(k).
1. if cF A
1
(k) = cBA
1
(k) then cF A
1

2. else if F A(k,c
BA
1

F A(k,c
FA

? 0.8 then cBA
1

3. else if F A(k,c

F A(k,c

? 0.2 then cF A

4. else if BA(k,c
FA

BA(k,c

? 0.53 then cF A

5. else if hits(k) ? 1300 then cBA
1
(k)
6. else if F A(k,c

F A(k,c

? 0.6 then cBA

7. else cF A

Table 7 shows the results of evaluating preci-
sion of answer selection methods against the de-
velopment set, when the keywords are selected
based on word weights in Section 3.1. In the
table, in addition to the result of answer selec-
tion rules above, the results with baselines of
selecting the choice with maximum FA or BA
are also shown. It is clear from the table that
the answer selection rules described here signif-
icantly outperforms those baselines.
For each of the answer selection rules, Ta-
ble 8 shows its precision. In the development
set4, there are 541 questions (about 60%) where
4Four questions are excluded because hits of the con-
junct query hits(X ? {Y }) were 0

these questions can be solved. This result shows
that whether FA and BA agree or not is very
important and is crucial for reliably selecting
the answer.
5 Total Procedure of Keyword
Selection and Answer Selection
Finally, the procedures of keyword selection and
answer selection presented in the previous sec-
tions are integrated as given below:
1. If ratio ? 0.25:
Use the set of keywords selected by BA ra-
tio with maximum and second maximum
FA. The choice to be selected is the one
with maximum BA.
2. Otherwise:
Use the set of keywords selected by word
weights. Answer selection is done by the
procedure of Section4.

6.1 Data Set
In this research, we used the card game ver-
sion of ?????????? (Who wants to be a

LTD. It has 1960 questions, which are classi-
fied into fifteen levels according to the amount
of prize money. Each question has four choices.
All questions are written in Japanese. The fol-
lowings give a few examples.

[Correct Answer: ??????]
We divide questions of each level into two
halves: first of which is used as the develop-
ment set and the second as the test set. We
exclude questions with superlative expressions
(e.g., Out of the following four countries, select
the one with the maximum number of states.)
or negation (e.g., Out of the following four col-
ors, which is not used in the national flag of
France.) because they are not suitable for solv-
ing by keyword association. Consequently, the
development set comprises 888 questions, while
the test set comprises 906 questions. The num-
ber of questions per prize money amount is
shown in Table 9.

track and those of NTCIR4 QAC2 task. The
questions of ?Who wants to be a millionaire?
are all classified as factoid question. They cor-
respond to TREC 2003 QA track factoid com-
ponent. The questions of NTCIR4 QAC2 are
also all classified as factoid question. We com-
pare bunsetsu 5 count of the questions of ?Who
wants to be a millionaire? with word count of
the questions of TREC 2003 QA track factoid
component and bunsetsu count of the questions
of NTCIR4 QAC2 Subtask1. The questions
of ?Who wants to be a millionaire? consist of
7.24 bunsetsu on average, while those of TREC
2003 QA track factoid component consist of 7.76
words on average, and those of NTCIR4 QAC2
Subtask1 consist of 6.19 bunsetsu on average.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the ques-
tions of ?Who wants to be a millionaire? are
not shorter than those of TREC 2003 QA track
and those of NTCIR4 QAC2 task.
6.2 Results
Against the development and the test sets,
Table 10 shows the results of evaluating the
total procedure of keyword selection and an-
swer selection presented in Section 5. The ta-
ble also shows the performance of baselines:
5A bunsetsu is one of the linguistic units in Japanese.
A bunsetsu consists of one content word possibly fol-
lowed by one or more function words.

Figure 1: Precision classified by prize money
amount
i.e., keyword association ratio presented in Sec-
tion 3.2.2, and word weights of Section 3.1 +
answer selection of Section 4. Integration of
keyword association ratio and word weight out-
performs those baselines. In total, about 79%
(for the development set) and 76% (for the test
set) of the questions are solved by the proposed
answer validation method based on keyword as-
sociation.
Comparing the performance of the two data
sets, word weights + answer selection has 4%
lower precision in the test set. This result indi-
cates that rules for word weights as well as an-
swer selection rules overfit to the development
set. On the other hand, the difference of the pre-
cisions of the keyword association ratio is much
less between the two data sets, indicating that
keyword association ratio has less overfit to the
development set.
Finally, the result of the experiment where
the development set was solved by the inte-
gration method was classified by prize money
amount. The result is shown in Figure 1. The
more the prize money amount is, the lower the
precision seems to be, while their precisions are
all above 60%, and their differences are less than
20% in most cases. It can be concluded that our
system can solve questions of all the levels al-
most equally.
7 Related Work
Kwok et al (2001) proposed the first automated
question-answering system which uses the web.
First, it collects documents that are related to
the question sentence using google and picks an-
swer candidates up from them. Second, it se-
lects an answer based on the frequency of can-
didates which appear near the keywords.
In the method proposed by Brill et al (2002),
answer candidates are picked up from the sum-
mary pages returned by a search engine. Then,
each answer candidate is validated by searching
for relevant documents in the TREC QA docu-
ment collection. Both methods do not consider
the number of hits returned by the search en-
gine.
Magnini et al (2002) proposed an answer val-
idation method which uses the number of search
engine hits. They formulate search engine
queries using AltaVista?s OR and NEAR oper-
ators. Major difference between the method of
Magnini et al (2002) and ours is in keyword se-
lection. In the method of Magnini et al (2002),
the initial keywords are content words extracted
from a question sentence. If the hits of keywords
is less than a threshold, the least important key-
word is removed. This procedure is repeated un-
til the hits of the keywords is over the threshold.
On the other hand, in our method, keywords
are selected so that the strength of the associ-
ation between the keyword and an answer can-
didate is maximized. Intuitively, our method of
keyword selection is more natural than that of
Magnini et al (2002), since it considers both
the question sentence and an answer candidate.
As for measures for scoring answer candidates,
Magnini et al (2002) proposed three measures,
out of which ?Corrected Conditional Probabil-
ity? performs best. In our implementation, the
performance of ?Corrected Conditional Proba-
bility? is about 5% lower than our best result.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed an approach of an-
swer validation based on the strengths of lexi-
cal association between the keywords extracted
from a question sentence and each answer can-
didate. The proposed answer validation process
is decomposed into two steps: the first is to
extract appropriate keywords from a question
sentence using word features and the strength
of lexical association, while the second is to es-
timate the strength of the association between
the keywords and an answer candidate based on
the hits of search engines. In the result of exper-
imental evaluation, we showed that a good pro-
portion (79%) of the multiple-choice quiz ?Who
wants to be a millionaire? can be solved by the
proposed method.
Future works include the followings: first, we
are planning to examine whether the syntactic
structures of the question sentence is useful for
selecting appropriate keywords from the ques-
tion sentence. Secondly, it is interesting to see
whether the keyword selection method proposed
in this paper is also effective for other applica-
tions such as answer candidate collection of the
whole question answering process.
