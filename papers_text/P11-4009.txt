Abstract 
Sentiment analysis is one of the hot de-
manding research areas since last few dec-
ades. Although a formidable amount of 
research have been done, the existing re-
ported solutions or available systems are 
still far from perfect or do not meet the sa-
tisfaction level of end users?. The main is-
sue is the various conceptual rules that 
govern sentiment and there are even more 
clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey 
these concepts from realization to verbali-
zation of a human being. Human psycholo-
gy directly relates to the unrevealed clues 
and governs the sentiment realization of us. 
Human psychology relates many things 
like social psychology, culture, pragmatics 
and many more endless intelligent aspects 
of civilization. Proper incorporation of hu-
man psychology into computational senti-
ment knowledge representation may solve 
the problem. In the present paper we pro-
pose a template based online interactive 
gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to 
automatically create the PsychoSenti-
WordNet involving internet population. 
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension 
of SentiWordNet that presently holds hu-
man psychological knowledge on a few as-
pects along with sentiment knowledge. 
1 Introduction 
In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical 
analysis plays a crucial role. For example, words 
like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate 
sentiment or opinion. Previous works (Pang et al, 
2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et. 
al., 2010) have already proposed various tech-
niques for making dictionaries for those sentiment 
words. But polarity assignment of such sentiment 
lexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation prob-
lem. The regulating aspects which govern the lexi-
cal level semantic orientation are natural language 
context (Pang et al, 2002), language properties 
(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic 
knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimen-
sion (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava 
and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hid-
den aspects. Therefore it is a challenging and 
enigmatic research problem. 
The current trend is to attach prior polarity to 
each entry at the sentiment lexicon level. Prior po-
larity is an approximation value based on heuristics 
based statistics collected from corpus and not ex-
act. The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity 
scores do not solve the problem completely rather 
it places the problem into next level, called contex-
tual polarity classification.  
We start with the hypothesis that the summation 
of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orienta-
tion is human psychology and thus it is a multi-
faceted problem (Liu, 2010). More precisely what 
we mean by human psychology is the union of all 
known and unknown aspects that directly or indi-
rectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge 
of us. The regulating aspects wrapped in the 
present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, 
City, Country, Language and Profession.  
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of the 
existing SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et. al., 
2010) to hold the possible psychological ingre-
dients and govern the sentiment understandability 
of us. The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variable 
prior polarity scores that could be fetched depend-
ing upon those psychological regulating aspects.

Share Broker   Positive 
 
In this paper, we propose an interactive gaming 
(Dr Sentiment) technology to collect psycho-
sentimental polarity for lexicons. This technology 
has proven itself as an excellent technique to col-
lect psychological sentiment of human society 
even at multilingual level. Dr Sentiment presently 
supports 56 languages and therefore we may call it 
Global PsychoSentiWordNet. The supported lan-
guages by Dr Sentiment are reported in Table 1. 
In this section we have philosophically argued 
about the necessity of developing PsychoSenti-
WordNet. In the next section 2 we will describe the 
technical details of the proposed architecture for 
building the lexical resource. Section 3 explains 
about some exciting outcomes of PsychoSenti-
WordNet. The developed PsychoSentiWordNet(s) 
are expected to help automatic sentiment analysis 
research in many aspects and other disciplines as 
well and have been described in section 4.The data 
structure and the organization are described in sec-
tion 5. The conclusion is drawn in section 6. 
2 Dr Sentiment 
Dr Sentiment1 is a template based interactive on-
line game, which collects player?s sentiment by 
asking a set of simple template based questions and 
finally reveals a player?s sentimental status. Dr 
Sentiment fetches random words from Senti-
WordNet synsets and asks every player to tell 
about his/her sentiment polarity understanding re-
garding the concept behind the word fetched by it.  
There are several motivations behind developing 
the intuitive game to automatically collect human 
psycho-sentimental orientation information.  
In the history of Information Retrieval research 
there is a milestone when ESP game2 (Ahn et al, 
2004) innovated the concept of a game to automat-
ically label images available in the World Wide 
Web. It has been identified as the most reliable 
strategy to automatically annotate the online im-

ages. We are highly motivated by the success of 
the Image Labeler game.  
A number of research endeavors could be found 
in the literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon 
in several languages and domains. These tech-
niques can be broadly categorized into two classes, 
one follows classical manual annotation techniques  
(Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Ri-
loff, 2006) while the other follows various auto-
matic techniques (Mohammad et al, 2008). Both 
types of techniques have few limitations. Manual 
annotation techniques are undoubtedly trustable 
but it generally takes time. Automatic techniques 
demand manual validations and are dependent on 
the corpus availability in the respective domain. 
Manual annotation techniques require a large num-
ber of annotators to balance one?s sentimentality in 
order to reach agreement. But human annotators 
are quite unavailable and costly. 
Sentiment is a property of human intelligence 
and is not entirely based on the features of a lan-
guage. Thus people?s involvement is required to 
capture the sentiment of the human society. We 
have developed an online game to attract internet 
population for the creation of PsychoSentiWord-
Net automatically. Involvement of Internet popula-
tion is an effective approach as the population is 
very high in number and ever growing (approx. 
360,985,492) 3 . Internet population consists of 
people with various languages, cultures, age etc 
and thus not biased towards any domain, language 
or particular society. A detailed statistics on the 
Internet usage and population has been reported in 
the Table 2. 
The lexicons tagged by this system are credible 
as it is tagged by human beings. It is not a static 
sentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time 
(Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly. Around 
10-20 players each day are playing it throughout 
the world in different languages. The average 
number of tagging per word is about 7.47 till date. 
The Sign Up form of the ?Dr Sentiment? game 
asks the player to provide personal information 
such as Sex, Age, City, Country, Language and 
Profession. These collected personal details of a 
player are kept as a log record in the database. 
The gaming interface has four types of question 
templates. The question templates are named as 
Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.

To make the gaming interface more interesting 
images have been added. These images have been 
retrieved by Google image search API 4  and to 
avoid biasness we have randomized among the 
first ten images retrieved by Google. 
2.1 Gaming Strategy 
Dr Sentiment asks 30 questions to each player. 
There are predefined distributions of each question 
type as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and 4 for 
Q4. These numbers are arbitrarily chosen and ran-
domly changed for experimentation. The questions 
are randomly asked to keep the game more inter-
esting. For word based translation Google transla-
tion5 service has been used. At each Question (Q) 
level translation service has been used to display 
the sentiment word into player?s own language. 
Google API provides multiple senses for word lev-
el translation and currently only the first sense has 
been picked automatically.  
2.2 Q1 
An English word from the English SentiWordNet 
synset is randomly chosen. The Google image 
search API is fired with the word as a query. An 
image along with the word itself is shown in the 
Q1 page of the game.

2.3 Q2 
This question type is specially designed for relative 
scoring technique. For example: good and better 
both are positive but we need to know which one is 
more positive than other. Table 3 shows how in 
SentiWordNet relative scoring has been made. 
With the present gaming technology relative polar-
ity scoring has been assigned to each n-n word pair 
combination. 
Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have been 
chosen from the source SentiWordNet synsets 
along with their images as retrieved by Google 
API. Each player is then asked to select one of 
them that he/she likes most. The relative score is 
calculated and stored in the corresponding log ta-
ble. 
Word Positivity Negativity 
Good 0.625 0.0 
Better 0.875 0.0 
Best 0.980 0.0 
Table 3: Relative Sentiment Scores in Senti-
WordNet 
52
2.4 Q3 
The player is asked for any positive word in his/her 
mind. This technique helps to increase the cover-
age of existing SentiWordNet. The word is then 
added to the existing PsychoSentiWordNet and 
further used in Q1 to other users to note their sen-
timentality about the particular word. 
2.5 Q4 
A player is asked by Dr Sentiment about any nega-
tive word. The word is then added to the existing 
PsychoSentiWordNet and further used in Q1 to 
other users to note their sentimentality about the 
particular word. 
2.6 Comment Architecture 
There are three types of Comments, Comment type 
1 (CMNT1), Comment type 2 (CMNT2) and the 
final comment as Dr Sentiment?s prescription. 
CMNT1 type and CMNT2 type comments are as-
sociated with question types Q1 and Q2 respective-
ly. 
2.6.1 CMNT1 
Comment type 1 has 5 variations as shown in the 
Comment table in Table 4. Comments are random-
ly retrieved from comment type table according to 
their category: 
 
? Positive word has been tagged as negative (PN) 
? Positive word has been tagged as positive (PP) 
? Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP) 
? Negative word has been tagged as negative (NN) 
? Neutral. (NU) 
2.6.2 CMNT2 
The strategy here is as same as the CMNT 1. 
Comment type 2 has only two variations as. 
? Positive word has been tagged as negative (PN) 
? Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP) 
2.7 Dr Sentiment?s Prescription 
The final prescription depends on various factors 
such as total number of positive, negative or neu-
tral comments and the total time taken by any 
player. The final prescription also depends on the 
range of the accumulated values of all the above 
factors.  
This is the most important appealing factor to a 
player. The motivating message for players is that 
Dr Sentiment can reveal their sentimental status: 
whether they are extreme negative or positive or 
very much neutral or diplomatic etc. It is not 
claimed that the revealed status of a player by Dr 
Sentiment is exact or ideal. It is only to make the 
players motivated but the outcomes of the game 
effectively helps to store human sentimental psy-
chology in terms of computational lexicon. 
A word previously tagged by a player is avoided 
by the tracking system during subsequent turns by 
the same player. The intension is to tag more and 
more words involving Internet population. We ob-
serve that the strategy helps to keep the game in-
teresting as a large number of players return to 
play the game after this strategy was implemented. 
3 Senti-Mentality 
PsychoSentiWordNet gives a good sketch to un-
derstand the psycho-sentimental behavior of the 
human society depending upon proposed psycho-
logical dimensions. The PsychoSentiWordNet is 
basically the log records of every player?s tagged 
words.  
3.1 Concept-Culture-Wise Analysis 
The word ?blue? gets tagged by different players 
around the world. But surprisingly it has been 
tagged as positive from one part of the world and 
negative from another part of the world. The 
graphical illustration in Figure 2 may explain the 
situation better. The observation is that most of the 
negative tags are coming from the middle-east and 
especially from the Islamic countries. 
PN PP NP NN NU 
You don?t like 
<word>! 
Good you have a good 
choice! Is <word> good! 
Yes <word> is too 
bad! 
You should speak out 
frankly! 
You should like 
<word>! I love <word> too! 
I hope it is a bad 
choice! You are quite right! 
You are too diplomat-
ic! 
But <word> is a good 
itself! I support your view! 
I don?t agree with 
you! 
I also don?t like 
<word>! 
Why you hiding from 
me? I am Dr Senti-
ment. 
Table 4: Comments 
53
We found a line in Wiki6 (see in Religion Section) 
that may provide a good explanation: ?Blue in Is-
lam: In verse 20:102 of the Qur?an, the word ??? 
zurq (plural of azraq 'blue') is used metaphorically 
for evil doers whose eyes are glazed with fear?. 
But other explanations may be there for this situa-
tion. This is an interesting observation that sup-
ports the effectiveness of the developed 
PsychoSentiWordNet. This information could be 
further retrieved from the developed source by giv-
ing information like (blue, Italy), (blue, Iraq) or 
(blue, USA) etc. 
 
Figure 2: Geospatial Senti-Mentality 
3.2 Age-Wise Analysis 
Another interesting observation is that sentimental-
ity may vary age-wise. For better understanding we 
look at the total statistics and the age wise distribu-
tion of all the players. Total 533 players have taken 
part till date. The total number of players for each 
range of age is shown at the top of every bar.  
 
Figure 3: Age-Wise Senti-Mentality 
In Figure 3 the horizontal bars are divided into two 
colors (Green depicts the Positivity and Red de-
picts the negativity) according to the total positivi-
ty and negativity scores, gathered during playing.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue 
This sociological study gives an idea on the varia-
tion of sentimentality with age.  This information 
may be retrieved from the developed source by 
giving information like (X, 36-39) or (X, 45-49) 
etc where X denotes any arbitrary lexicon synset. 
3.3 Gender-Wise Analysis 
It is observed from the collected statistics that 
women are more positive than men! The variations 
in sentimentality among men and women are 
shown in the following Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4: Gender Specific Senti-Mentality 
3.4 Other-Wise 
We have described several important observations 
in the previous sections and there are other impor-
tant observations as well. Studies on the combina-
tions of the proposed psychological dimensions, 
such as, location-age, location-profession and 
gender-location may reveal some interesting re-
sults.  
4 Expected Impact of the Resource 
Undoubtedly the generated PsychoSentiWord-
Net(s) are important resources for senti-
ment/opinion or emotion analysis task. Moreover 
the other non linguistic psychological dimensions 
are very much important for further analysis as 
well as for several newly discovered sub-
disciplines such as: Geospatial Information retriev-
al (Egenhofer, 2002), Personalized search (Gaucha 
et al, 2003), Recommender System (Adomavicius 
and Tuzhilin, 2005), Sentiment Tracking (Tong, 
2001) etc. 
5 The Data Structure and Organization 
Deciding on the data structure for the PsychoSen-
tiWordNet was not trivial. Presently RDBMS (Re-
lational Database Management System) has been 
54
used. Several tables are being used to keep user?s 
clicking log and their personal information.  
As one of the research motivations was to gen-
erate up-to-date prior polarity scores across various 
dimensions, we decided to generate web service 
API through which the people can access latest 
prior polarity scores. The developed PsychoSenti-
WordNet is expected to perform better than a static 
sentiment lexicon. 
6 Conclusion and Future Directions 
In the present paper the development of the Psy-
choSentiWordNet for 56 languages has been de-
scribed. No evaluation has been done yet as there 
is no data available for this kind of experimenta-
tion and to the best of our knowledge this is the 
first endeavor where sentiment analysis meets AI 
and psychology.  
Our present goal is to collect such corpus and 
carry out experiments to check whether variable 
prior polarity scores of PsychoSentiWordNet excel 
over the fixed point prior polarity score of Senti-
WordNet. 
Automatically picked first sense from Google 
translation API may cause difficulties for cross 
lingual projection of sentiment synsets. Erroneous 
outputs from API may also cause some problems. 
But these problems lead to another research issue 
that may be termed as cross lingual sentiment syn-
set linking. Presently we are giving a closer look to 
the qualitative analysis of developed multilingual 
psycho-sentiment lexicons.
