The deve lo~aent  o f  a read i~ machine fo r  the b l ind  
imp l ies  the so lu t ion  of problems on such d iverse  f ie lds  as 
linguistics, micro computing and ergonomics.  Because of  the 
s ta ts  of  the ar t  in  Computat ional  Lin&qaist$cs, however, the 
l in~qa is t i c  problems turn  out to  be the major  draw bask in  
th i s  f ie ld  o f  sc ient i f i c  endeavor .  That i s  the  reason  why the  
paper fo r  the greater  part  i s  devoted to the descr ip t ion  of  a 
new model fo r  automated phonemizat ion.  This model i s  app l ied  
to  Dutch. The model was developed fo r  words on ly .  Thus, the  
read ing  manhins as i t  s tands now i s  ab le  to pronounce a ser ies

ed YONGRAF. I t  was developed at  the Un ivers i ty  of  Ut recht .  The 
computer program FONGRAF i s  ab le  to perform a t ranscr ip t ion

pr inc ip les  of  phonematic t ransor?pt ion .  The paper fooueses  on 
the  des ign  of  the prepare  and enswers quest ions  concern ing  the  
re la t ion  between the  techn ica l  par t  ( implamentat ion)  and the 
l ingu is t i c  cons iderat ions  behind the  computer progj~em. 
I t  i s  argued that  in  the past  computer programs per form-  
ing  th i s  l ingu is t i c  task  were pr inc ipa l ly  des igned from the 
- 46 -  
implementat ion  po int  of  v iew. This has led  to computer pro -  
grams wi~h a s t rong  ad hoc kind of problem so lv ing  part  in  i t .  
There fore , these  computer prod, rams turn  out to be not adaptab le  
tO new situations and unforeseen mistakes.ln this paper it is 
argued that for the solution of linguistic problems of this 
kind a pat tern  mato~-tng computer program has to be deve loped.  
I t  should go without say ing that  a computer des igned fo r  
l in6~is t io  purposes should be f i rmly  based on the l ingu is t i c  
analysis of the task. As far as the search for regularities in 
the phonet ic  in terpreta t ion  of wr i t ten  text  i s  concerned we 
used the phono log ica l  theory  as an important  a id .  The phono- 
log ica l  descr ip t ion  of  the Dutch language was used as the most 
important  source  fo r  the  de f in i t ion  of  the pat tern  marcher in  
the computer program FONGRAP. Many of the observed regularit- 
ies regarding the Dutch phoneme distribution and phonologloal 
ru les  concern ing the phonet ic  in terpreta t ion  of the phono log ic -  
a l  forms of  Dutch morphemes are par t i cu la r ly  use fu l  to  our 
problem in  that  they s ta te  the surroundings  which a f fec t  a 
par t i cu la r  phoneme. For ins tance  the ass imi la t ion  ru le  that  a 
consonant becomes vo ice less  or  vo iced  accord ing  to the "vo ice"  
of  the fo l low ing  consonant.  This k ind of  ru les  app l ies  even in  
surroundings where the sy l lab le  boundar ies  are  invo lved .  This 
i s  the reason why we cons ider  the app l i ca t ion  of  hyphenat ion 
programs to be out of  p lace  as fa r  as the so lu t ion  of  the 
phonemat izat ion  problem for  Dutch words i s  concerned,  This a l so  
i s  the main reason  why we developed a pat tern  matching comput- 
er  program. A fu r ther  advantage of the pat tern  matching pro -  
gram i s  that  i t  i s  easy to implement "new" regu lar i t ies .  With 
the not ion  "new" regu lar i t ies  we re fer  to  ru les  and regu lar i t -  
i es  not descr ibed  b~ normal phonology.  Those regu lar i t ies  
o f ten  are caused by the fac t  that  a computer i s  too " l i te ra l " .  
Nat ive  speakers  w i l l ,  e .g .  not confuse any le t te r - sequence
