Abstract
In recent years statistical dialogue systems
have gained significant attention due to their
potential to be more robust to speech recogni-
tion errors. However, these systems must also
be robust to changes in user behaviour caused
by cognitive loading. In this paper, a statistical
dialogue system providing restaurant informa-
tion is evaluated in a set-up where the sub-
jects used a driving simulator whilst talking to
the system. The influences of cognitive load-
ing were investigated and some clear differ-
ences in behaviour were discovered. In partic-
ular, it was found that users chose to respond
to different system questions and use different
speaking styles, which indicate the need for an
incremental dialogue approach.
1 Introduction
A spoken dialogue system enables a user to obtain
information while using their hands to perform some
other task, which in many cases is the user?s primary
task. A typical example is an in-car spoken dialogue
system where the spoken interaction is secondary to
the main task of driving the car (Weng et al, 2004).
This domain is particularly challenging since it in-
volves dealing with the errors caused by the varying
noise levels and changes in user behaviour caused
by the cognitive load.
A statistical approach to dialogue modelling has
been proposed as a means of automatically optimis-
ing dialogue policies. In particular, the partially ob-
servable Markov decision process (POMDP) model
for dialogue provides a representation of varying
levels of uncertainty of the user input, yielding more
robust dialogue policies (Williams and Young, 2007;
Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al, 2010).
Another thread of research deals with speech
interfaces for in-car applications, see (Baron and
Green, 2006) for a review. Past research has inves-
tigated the extent to which speaking is cognitively
less demanding than typing (Gartner et al, 2001;
Tsimhoni et al, 2004; Kun et al, 2007). In addi-
tion, considerable research has examined how driv-
ing safety is influenced by a dialogue system (Lai
et al, 2001; Lee et al, 2001; Nielsen et al, 2008).
However, to the best of our knowledge, little work
has been done to investigate the effect of the cog-
nitive load when interacting with a real conversa-
tional spoken dialogue system. The work presented
in (Mishra et al, 2004) suggests that the user speech
is more disfluent when the user is performing an-
other task. However, this work is based on a Wiz-
ard of Oz framework, where a human provides the
system?s responses. Also, a push-to-talk button was
used for every utterance which will have affected the
natural flow of the dialogue. It is important to know
if the change of cognitive load has an effect on the
speaking style and whether the system can alter its
behaviour to accommodate for this.
In this paper we try to answer these questions by
examining dialogues where users drove a car simu-
lator and talked to an open-microphone fully auto-
mated spoken dialogue system at the same time.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides an overview of the dialogue system
used and section 3 describes the evaluation set-up.
The analysis of the results is given in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 concludes the paper.

2 System overview
The user speaks to the system, and the acoustic sig-
nal is converted by the speech recogniser into a set
of sentence hypotheses, which represents a proba-
bility distribution over all possible things that the
user might have said. The sentence hypotheses are
converted into an N-best list of dialogue acts by a
semantic decoder. Since the dialogue state cannot
be directly observed it maintains a probability dis-
tribution over all states, which is called the belief
state. The belief state is updated at every user turn
using Bayesian inference treating the input dialogue
acts as evidence. Based on belief state, the optimal
system act is selected using a policy and which is
trained automatically using reinforcement learning.
The abstract system dialogue act is converted to an
appropriate utterance by a natural language genera-
tor and then converted to speech by an HMM-based
speech synthesiser. To enable in-car speech inter-
action via mobile phone, a VoIP interface is imple-
mented. The domain is Cambridge restaurant infor-
mation with a database of about 150 venues and 7
slots that users can query.
3 Evaluation set-up
Our goal is to understand system performance
when driving. However, due to the safety restric-
tions, performance was tested using a driving simu-
lator. The following sections explain the set-up.
3.1 Car simulator
The car simulator used in the evaluation was the
same as in (Davies and Robinson, 2011). It con-
sists of a seat, a steering wheel and pedals, which
give a realistic cab-like environment for the par-
ticipants. There is also a projection screen which
largely fills the visual field of the driver. The sim-
ulation software is a modified version of Rockstar
Games? Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with over
500 km of roads. For the purpose of the evaluation,
the subjects were asked to drive on the main motor-
way, to keep the lane and not to drive over 70mph.
3.2 Subjects
For the study 28 subjects were recruited, 22 where
native speakers. Each subject had to complete three
scenarios: (1) to drive the car simulator for 10 min-
utes, (2) to talk to the system for 7 dialogues and (3)
to talk to the system for 7 dialogues while driving.
The scenarios were in counter-balanced order.
While they were driving, the speed and the road
position were recorded. If the scenario involved
talking to the system, the instructor read out the di-
alogue task (see an example in Table 1) and dialled
the phone number. In addition, the subject had the
dialogue task displayed on a small screen next to the
driving wheel. The subject talked to the system us-
ing loud speaker mode on the mobile phone.
4 Results
To examine the influence of cognitive load, the
following examinations were performed. First, we
investigate if the subjects felt any change in the cog-
nitive load (Section 4.1). Then, in Section 4.2, we
examine how the driving was influenced by the sub-
jects talking to the system. Finally, we investigate
how successfully the subjects were able to complete
the dialogue tasks while driving (Section 4.3). This
is followed with an examination of the conversa-
tional patterns that occurred when the subjects were
driving whilst talking to the system (Section 4.4).
4.1 Cognitive load
After each scenario the subjects were asked to an-
swer five questions based on the NASA-TLX self-
reporting scheme for workload measurement. They
answered by providing a rating from 1 (very easy)
to 5 (very hard). The averaged results are given
in Table 2. We performed a Kruskal test, followed
by pairwise comparisons for every scenario for each
answer and all differences are statistically signifi-
cant (p < 0.03) apart from the differences in the
frustration, the stress and the pace between talking
and talking and driving. This means that they were
clearly able to feel the change in cognitive load.

4.2 Driving performance
For 26 subjects we recorded position on the road
and the speed. Since these measurements vary sig-
nificantly across the subjects, for each subject we
calculated the average speed, the standard deviation
and the entropy and similarly for the average posi-
tion in the lane. For the speed, we computed how
many subjects had a higher average speed when they
were talking and driving versus when they were just
talking and similarly for the standard deviation and
the entropy. The results are given in Table 3. It
can be seen that the user?s speed is lower when they
are driving and talking, however, the increase in the
standard deviation and the entropy suggest that their
driving is more erratic. No significant differences
were observed for the road position.
4.3 Dialogue task completion
Each participant performed 14 dialogues, 7 for each
scenario. In total, there were 196 dialogues per sce-
nario. After each dialogue they told the instruc-
tor if they thought the dialogue was successful, and
this information was used to compute the subjective

completion rate. In addition, all dialogues were tran-
scribed and analysed to see if the system provided
information the user asked for and hence calculate
an objective completion rate. The results are given
in Table 4. These differences are not statistically sig-
nificant due to the small sample size. However, it
can be seen that the trend is that the dialogues where
the subject was not performing another task at the
same time were more successful. Also, it is inter-
esting that the subjective scores are higher than the
objective ones. This can be explained by the fact that
the dialogue tasks were predefined and the subjects
do not always pay sufficient attention to their task
descriptions.
4.4 Conversational patterns
Given that the subjects felt the change of cognitive
load when they were talking to the system and op-
erating the car simulator at the same time, we were
interested to see if there are any changes in the dia-
logues which might suggest this.
First, we examine how well they follow the given
task on a turn-to-turn basis. For example, if the task
is to find a cheap restaurant and if at some point
in the dialogue the user says I?d like an expensive
restaurant that turn is not consistent with the task.
The results are given in Table 5 and they are statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.01).
We then examine the number of contradictions on
a turn-to-turn basis. For example, if the user says I?d
like a cheap restaurant and later on they say I?d like

Talking&Driving 390 63.9%
2. system confirms
Samples Obedience
Talking 91 73.6%
Talking&Driving 92 81.5%
an expensive restaurant the latter turn is clearly a
contradiction. The percentage of contradicting turns
is less than 1% and the difference between the sce-
narios is not statistically significant. This suggests
that while users tend to forget the task they are given
when they are driving, they still act rationally despite
the increase in the cognitive load.
The next analysis concerns the user obedience,
i.e. the extent to which subjects answer the sys-
tem questions. We grouped the system questions in
two classes. The first class represents the questions
where the system requests a value for a particular
slot, for instance What part of town are you looking
for? and the questions where the system confirms
and requests at the same time, for instance You are
looking for a cheap restaurant. What part of town
are you looking for? The second class correspond to
system confirmations, for example Did you say you
are looking for a cheap restaurant? The percent-
age of the obedient user turns per class is given in
Table 6. Due to the small sample size these results
are not statistically significant. Still, it is interest-
ing to see that when driving the subjects appear to
be more obedient to the system confirmations than
when they are just talking. When the system makes
a confirmation, the user can answer with simple yes
or no, whereas when the system requests the value
of a particular slot, the user needs to think more to
provide an answer.
The number of barge-ins, the number of filler
words and the average speech intensity vary con-
siderably among the subjects. Therefore, we aver-
age these statistics per user and examine the number
of users for which the particular measure is greater
for the scenario where they talked to the system and
drove the simulator at the same time. The results

More barge-ins 87% [69%, 96%]
More fillers 73% [54%, 88%]
Higher intensity 67% [47%, 83%]
(Table 7) show that the number of barge-ins and the
number of fillers is significantly greater for the sce-
nario when they are talking and driving and the in-
tensity on average tend to be greater.
5 Conclusion and Future work
There are several important observations arising
from this study. Firstly, dialogues with cognitively
loaded users tend to be less successful. This sug-
gests that the system should alter its behaviour to
match user behaviour and alleviate the cognitive
load in order to maintain the level of performance.
This necessitates rapid on-line adaptation of dia-
logue policies.
The second observation is that cognitively loaded
users tend to respond to some types of system ques-
tions more than others. This indicates that the user
model within a POMDP dialogue system should be
conditioned on a measure of cognitive load.
Finally, this study has found that users barge-in
and use filler words significantly more often when
they are cognitively loaded. This suggests the need
for a much richer turn-taking model which allows
the system to use back-channels and barge-in when
the user hesitates. An obvious candidate is the in-
cremental approach (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009;
DeVault et al, 2009) which allows the system to pro-
cess partial user inputs, back-channels, predict short
term user input and interrupt the user during hesita-
tions. While incremental dialogue is a growing area
of study, it has not so far been examined in the con-
text of dialogue for secondary tasks. We signpost
this as an important area for future work.
