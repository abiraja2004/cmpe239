ABSTRACT 
A major axis of research at LIMSI is directed at multilingual, 
speaker-independent, large vocabulary speech dictation. In this pa- 
per the LIMSI recognizer which was evaluated in the ARPA NOV93 
CSR test is described, and experimental results on the WSJ and 
BREF corpora under closely matched conditions are reported. For 
both corpora word recognition expenrnents were carried out with 
vocabularies containing up to 20k words. The recognizer makes 
use of continuous density HMM with Gaussian mixture for acous- 
tic modeling and n-gram statistics estimated on the newspaper texts 
for language modeling. The recognizer uses a time-synchronous 
graph-search strategy which is shown to still be viable with a 20k- 
word vocabulary when used with bigram back-off language models. 
A second forward pass, which makes use of a word graph generated 
with the bigram, incorporates a trigram language model. Acoustic 
modeling uses cepstrum-based f atures, context-dependent phone 
models (intra and interword), phone duration models, and sex- 
dependent models. 
INTRODUCTION 
Speech recognition research at LIMSI aims to develop rec- 
ognizers that are task-, speaker-, and vocabulary-independent 
so as to be easily adapted to a variety of applications. The 
applicability of speech recognition techniques used for one 
language to other languages is of particular importance in 
Europe. The multilingual aspects are in part carried out in 
the context of the LRE SQALE (Speech recognizer Qual- 
ity Assessment for Linguistic Engineering) project, which 
is aimed at assessing language dependent issues in multilin- 
gual recognizer evaluation. In this project, the same system 
will be evaluated on comparable tasks in different languages 
(English, French and German) to determine cross-lingual dif- 
ferences, and different recognizers will be compared on the 
same language to compare advantages of different recogni- 
tion strategies. 
In this paper some of the primary issues in large vocabu- 
lary, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition for 
dictation are addressed. These issues include language mod- 
eling, acoustic modeling, lexical representation, and search.

text material. To deal with phonological variability alter- 
nate pronunciations are included in the lexicon, and optional 
phonological rules are applied during training and recogni- 
tion. The recognizer uses a time-synchronous graph-search 
strategy\[16\] for a first pass with a bigram back-off language 
model (LM)\[10\]. A trigram LM is used in a second acoustic 
decoding pass which makes use of the word graph generated 
using the bigram LM\[6\]. Experimental results are reported 
on the ARPA Wall Street Journal (WSJ)\[19\] and BREF\[14\] 
corpora, using for both corpora over 37k utterances for acous- 
tic training and more than 37 million words of newspaper text 
for language model training. While the number of speakers 
is larger for WSJ, the total amount of acoustic training ma- 
terial is about the same (see Table 1). It is shown that for 
both corpora increasing the amount of training utterances by 
an order of magnitude reduces the word error by about 30%. 
The use of a trigram LM in a second pass also gives an error 
reduction of 20% to 30%. The combined error reduction is 
on the order of 50%. 
LANGUAGE MODEL ING 
Language modeling entails incorporating constraints on 
the allowable sequences of words which form a sentence. 
Statistical n-gram models attempt o capture the syntactic 
and semantic onstraints by estimating the frequencies of 
sequences of n words. In this work bigram and trigram lan- 
guage models are estimated on the training text material for 
each corpus. This data consists of 37M words of the WSJ 1 
and 38M words of Le Monde. A backoff mechanism\[10\] 
is used to smooth the estimates of the probabilities of rare 
n-grams by relying on a lower order n-gram when there is 
insufficient training data, and to provide a means of model- 
ing unobserved n-grams. Another advantage of the backoff 
mechanism is that LM size can be arbitrarily reduced by re- 
lying more on the backoff, by increasing the minimum num- 
ber of required n-gram observations needed to include the 
n-gram. This property can be used in the first bigram decod- 
1While we have built n-gram-backoff LMs directly from the 37M-word 
standardized WSJ training text material, inthese xperiments all results are 
reported using the 5k or 20k, bigram and tfigram backoff LMs provided by 
Lincoln Labs\[ 19\] as required by ARPA so as to be compatible with the other 
sites participating in the tests. 
ing pass to reduce computational requirements. The trigram 
langage model is used in the second pass of the decoding 
process:. 
In order to be able to constnact LMs for BREF, it was 
necessary to normalize the text material of Le Monde newpa- 
per, which entailed apre-treatment rather different from that 
used to normalize the WSJ texts\[19\]. The main differences 
are in the treatment of compound words, abbreviations, and 
case. In BREF the distinction between the cases is kept if 
it designates a distinctive graphemic feature, but not when 
the upper case is simply due to the fact that the word oc- 
curs at the beginning of the sentence. Thus, the first word 
of each sentence was semi-automatically verified to deter- 
mine if a transformation to lower case was needed. Special 
treatment is also needed for the symbols hyphen (-), quote 
('), and period (.) which can lead to ambiguous separations. 
For example, the hyphen in compound words like beaux-arts 
and au-dessus i considered word-internal. Alternatively the 
hyphen may be associated with the first word as in ex-, or 
anti-, or with the second word as in -Id or -nL Finally, it may 
appear in the text even though it is not associated with any 
word. The quote can have two different separations: it can 
be word internal (aujourd' hui, o'Donnel, hors-d'oeuvre), or
may be part of the first word (l'aml). Similarly the period 
may be part of a word, for instance, L.A., sec. (secondes), p.
(page), or simply an end-of-sentence mark. 
Table 1 compares ome characteristics of the WSJ and Le 
Monde text corpora. In the same size training texts, there 
are almost 60% more distinct words for Le Monde than for 
WSJ without aking case into account. 2 As a consequence, 
the lexical coverage for a given size lexicon is smaller for 
Le Monde than for WSJ. For example, the 20k WSJ lexicon 
accounts for 97.5% of word occurrences, but the 20k BREF 
lexicon only covers 94.9% of word occurrences in the training 
texts. For lexicons in the range of 5k to 40k words, the 
number of words must be doubled for Le Monde in order to 
obtain the same word coverage as for WSJ. 
The lexical ambiguity is also higher for French than for 
English. The homophone rate (the number of words which 
have a homophone divided by the total number of words) in 
the 20k BREF lexicon is 57% compared to 9% in 20k-open 
WSJ lexicon. This effect is even greater if the word fre- 
quencies are taken into account. Given a perfect phonemic 
transcription, 23% of words in the WSJ training texts is am- 
biguous, whereas 75% of the words in the Le Monde training 
texts have an ambiguous phonemic transcription. Not only 
does one phonemic form correspond to different orthographic 
forms, there can also be a relatively large number of possi- 
ble pronunciations for a given word. In French, the alternate 
pronunciations arise mainly from optional word-final phones, 
due to liaison and optional word-final consonant cluster e-

training material.

counting for about 17% and 3% of all word occurrences in

ACOUSTIC-PHONETIC  MODEL ING 
The recognizer makes use of continuous density HMM 
(CDHMM) with Gaussian mixture for acoustic modeling. 
The main advantage continuous density modeling offers 
over discrete or semi-continuous (or tied-mixture) observa- 
tion density modeling is that the number of parameters used 
to model an HMM observation distribution can easily be 
adapted to the amount of available training data associated 
to this state. As a consequence, high precision modeling can 
be achieved for highly frequented states without he explicit 
need of smoothing techniques for the densities of less fre- 
quented states. Discrete and semi-continuous modeling use 
a fixed number of parameters torepresent a given observation 
density and therefore cannot achieve high precision without 
the use of smoothing techniques. This problem can be alle- 
viated by tying some states of the Markov models in order 
to have more training data to estimate ach state distribution. 
However, since this kind of tying requires careful design and 
some a priori assumptions, these techniques are primarily of 
interest when the training data is limited and cannot easily be 
increased. In the experimental section we demonstrate he 
improvement in performance obtained on the same test data 
by simply using additional training material. 
A 48-component feature vector is computed every 10 ms. 
This feature vector consists of 16 Bark-frequency scale cep- 
strum coefficients computed on the 8kHz bandwidth and their 
first and second order derivatives. For each frame (30 ms 
window), a 15 channel Bark power spectrum is obtained by 
applying triangular windows to the DFT output. The cep- 
strum coefficients are then computed using a cosinus trans- 
form \[2\]. 
The acoustic models are sets of context-dependent(CD), 
position independent phone models, which include both 
intra-word and cross-word contexts. The contexts are au- 
tomatically selected based on their frequencies in the train- 
ing data. The models include tfiphone models, fight- and 
320 
left-context phone models, and context-independent phone 
models. Each phone model is a left-to-right CDHMM with 
Gaussian mixture observation densities (typically 32 com- 
ponents). The covariance matrices of all the Gaussians are 
diagonal. Duration is modeled with a gamma distribution 
per phone model. The HMM and duration parameters are es- 
timated separately and combined in the recognition process 
for the Viterbi search. Maximum a postedori estimators are 
used for the HMM parameters\[8\] and moment estimators for 
the gamma distributions. Separate male and female models 
are used to more accurately model the speech data. 
Dunng system development phone recognition has been 
used to evaluate different acoustic model sets. It has been 
shown that improvements in phone accuracy are directly in- 
dicative of improvements in word accuracy when the same 
phone models are used for recognition\[12\]. Phone recog- 
nition provides the added benefit hat the recognized phone 
string can be used to understand word recognition errors and 
problems in the lexical representation. 
LEX ICAL  REPRESENTATION 
Lexicons containing 5k, 20k, and 64k words have been 
used in these experiments. The lexicons are represented 
phonemically, using language-specific sets of phonemes. 
Each lexicon has alternate pronunciations for some of the 
words, and allows some of the phones to be optional) A 
pronunciation graph is generated for each word from the 
baseform transcription to which word internal phonological 
rules are optionally applied during training and recognition 
to account for some of the phonological variations observed 
in fluent speech. The WSJ lexicons are represented using 
a set of 46 phonemes, including 21 vowels, 24 consonants, 
and silence. Training and test lexicons were created at LIMSI 
and include some input from modified versions of the TIMIT, 
Pocket and Moby lexicons. Missing forms were generated 
by rule when possible, or added by hand. Some pronoun- 
ciations for proper names were kindly provided by Murray 
Spiegel at Bellcore from the Orator system. The BREF lexi- 
cons, corresponding to the 5k and 20k most common words 
in the Le Monde texts are represented with 35 phonemes in- 
cluding 14 vowels, 20 consonants, and silence\[3\]. The base 
pronunciations, obtained using text-to-phoneme rules\[20\], 
were extended to annotate potential liaisons and pronunci- 
ation variants. Some example lexical entries are given in 
Figure 1. 
Word boundary phonological rules are applied in build- 
ing the phone graph used by the recognizer so as to allow 
for some of the phonological variations observed in fluent 
speech\[11\]. The principle behind the phonological rules is 
to modify the phone network to take into account such vari- 
3About 10% of the lexical entries have multiple transcriptions, if the 
word final optional phonemes marking possible liaisons for BREF are not 
included. Including these raises the number of entries with multiple tran- 
scriptions to almost 40%.

ations. These rules are optionally applied during training 
and recognition. Using optional phonological rules during 
training results in better acoustic models, as they are less 
"polluted" by wrong transcriptions. Their use during recog- 
nition reduces the number of mismatches. For English, only 
? well known phonological rules, such as glide insertion, stop 
deletion, homorganic stop insertion, palatalization, and voic- 
ing assimilation have been incorporated in the system. The 
same mechanism has been used to handle liaisons, mute-e, 
and final consonant cluster eduction for French. 
SEARCH STRATEGY 
One of the most important problems in implementing a 
large vocabulary speech recognizer is the design of an effi- 
cient search algorithm to deal with the huge search space, 
especially when using language models with a longer span 
than two successive words, such as trigrams. The most com- 
monly used approach for small and medium vocabulary sizes 
is the one-pass frame-synchronous beam search \[16\] which 
uses a dynamic programming procedure. This basic strategy 
has been recently extended by adding other features uch 
as "fast match"\[9, 1\], N-best rescoring\[21\], and progressive 
search\[15\]. The two-pass approach used in our system is 
based on the idea of progressive search where the informa- 
tion between levels is transmitted via word graphs. Prior 
to word recognition, sex identification is performed for each 
sentence using phone-based ergodic HMMs\[13\]. The word 
recognizer is then run with a bigram LM using the acoustic 
model set corresponding to the identified sex. 
The first pass uses a bigram-backoff LM with a tree or- 
ganization of the lexicon for the backoff component. This 
one-pass frame-synchronous beam search, which includes 
intra- and inter-word CD phone models, intra- and inter- 
word phonological rules, phone duration models, and gender- 
dependent models, generates a list of word hypotheses result- 
ing in a word lattice. Two problems need to be considered 
321 
at this level. The first is whether or not the dynamic pro- 
gramming procedure used in the first pass, which guarantees 
the optimality of the search for the bigram, generates an "op- 
timal" lattice to be used with a trigram LM. For example, 
any giwen word in the lattice will have many possible nding 
points, but only a few starting points. This problem was in 
fact less severe than expected since the time information is
not critical to generate an "optimal" word graph from the 
lattice, i.e. the multiple word endings provide nough flexi- 
bility to compensate for single word beginnings. The second 
consideration is that the lattice generated in this way cannot 
be too large or there is no interest in a two pass approach. To 
solve this second problem, two pruning thresholds are used 
during r, he first pass, a beam search pruning threshold which 
is kept to a level insuring almost no search errors (from the 
bigram point of view) and a word lattice pruning threshold 
used to control the lattice size. 
A description of the exact procedure used to generate the 
word graph from the word lattice is beyond the scope of this 
paper. The following steps give the key elements behind the 
procedure. 4 First, a word graph is generated from the lattice 
by merging three consecutive frames (i.e. the minimum 
duration for a word in our system). Then, "similar" graph 
nodes are merged with the goal of reducing the overall graph 
size and generalizing the word lattice. This step is reiterated 
until no further eductions are possible. Finally, based on 
the trigram backoff language model a trigram word graph 
is then generated by duplicating the nodes having multiple 
language model contexts. Bigram backoff nodes are created 
when possible to limit the graph expansion. 
To fix these ideas, let us consider some numbers for the 
WSJ 5k-closed vocabulary. With the pruning threshold set 
at a level such that there are only a negligible number of 
search errors, the first pass generates a word lattice contain- 
ing on average 10,000 word hypotheses per sentence. The 
generated word graph before trigram expansion contains on 
average 1400 arcs. After expansion with the trigram backoff 
LM, there are on average 3900 word instanciations including 
silences which are treated the same way as words. 
It should be noted that this decoding strategy based on 
two forward passes can in fact be implemented in a single 
forward pass using one or two processors. We are using a 
two pass solution because it is conceptually simpler, and also 
due to memory constraints. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
WSJ: The ARPA WSJ corpus\[19\] was designed to provide 
general-purpose speech data with large vocabularies. Text 
materials were selected to provide training and test data for 
5k and 20k word, closed and open vocabularies, and with 
both verbalized (VP) and non-verbalized (NVP) punctuation. 
41n our implementation, a word lattice differs from a word graph only 
because it includes word endpoint information.

For testing purposes, the 20k closed vocabulary includes all 
the words in the test data whereas the 20k open vocabulary 
contains only the 20k most common words in the WSJ texts. 
The 20k open test is also referred to as a 64k test since 
all of the words in these sentences occur in the 63,495 most 
frequent words in the normalized WSJ text material\[ 19\]. Two 
sets of standard training material have been used for these 
experiments: The standard WSJ0 SI84 training data which 
include 7240 sentences from 84 speakers, and the standard set 
of 37,518 WSJ0/WSJ1 SI284 sentences from 284 speakers. 
Only the primary microphone data were used for training. 
The WSJ corpus provides a wealth of material that can be 
used for system development. We have worked primarily 
with the WSJ0-Dev (410 sentences, 10 speakers), and the 
WSJ1-Dev from spokes 5 and s6 (394 sentences, 10 speak- 
ers). Development of the word recognizer was done with the 
5k closed vocabulary system in order to reduce the compu- 
tational requirements. The Nov92 5k and 20k nvp test sets 
were used to assess progress during this development phase. 
The WSJ system was evaluated in the Nov92 ARPA evalu- 
ation test\[17\] for the 5k-closed vocabulary and in the Nov93 
ARPA evaluation test\[18\] for the 5k and 64k hubs. Except 
when explicitly stated otherwise, all of the results reported 
for WSJ use the standard language models\[19\]. Using a set 
of 1084 CD models trained with the WSJ0 si84 training data, 
the word error is 6.6% on the Nov92 5k test data and 9.4% 
on the Nov93 test data. Using the combined WSJ0\]WSJ1 
si284 training data reduces the error by about 27% for both 
tests. When a trigram LM is used in the second pass, the 
word error is reduced by an addition 35% on the Nov92 test 
and by 22% on the Nov93 test. 
Results are given in the Table 3 for the Nov92 nvp 64K 
322 
test data using both closed and open 20k vocabularies. With 
si84 training (si84c, a slightly smaller model set than si84) 
the word error ate is doubled when the vocabulary increases 
from 5k to 20k words and the test perplexity goes from 111 
to 244. The higher error rate with the 20k open lexicon 
can be largely attributed to the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
words, which account for almost 2% of the words in the 
test sentences. Processing the same test data with a system 
trained on the si284 training data, reduces the word error by 
30%. The word error on the Nov93 20k test is 15.2% with 
the si284 system. Using the trigrarn LM reduces the error 
rate by 18% on the Nov92 test and 22% on the Nov93 test. 
The 20k trigram sentence error ates for Nov92 and Nov93 
are 60% and 62% respectively. Since this is an open vocab- 
ulary test, the lower bound for the sentence rror is given 
by the percent of sentences with OOV words, which is 26% 
for Nov92 and 21% for Nov93. In addition there are errors 
introduced by the use of word graphs generated by the first 
pass. The graph error rate (ie. the correct solution was not 
in the graph) was 6% and 12% respectively for Nov92 and 
Nov93. In fact, in most of these cases the errors should not 
be considered search errors as the recognized string has a 
higher likelihood than the correct string. 
A final test was run using a 64k lexicon in an attempt to 
eliminate rrors due to unknown words. (In principle, all of 
the read WSJ prompts are found in the 64k most frequent 
words, however, since the WSJ1 data were recorded with 
non-normalized prompts, additional OOV words can occur.) 
Running a full 64k system was not possible with the com- 
puting facilities available, so we added a third decoding pass 
to extend the vocabulary size. Starting with the phone string 
corresponding to the hypothesis of the trigram 20k system, 
an A* algorithm isused to generate a word graph using phone 
confusion statistics and the 64k lexicon. This word graph is 
then used by the recognizer with a 64k trigram LM trained 
on the standard WSJ training texts (37M words). Using this 
approach only about 30% of the errors due to OOV words on 
the Nov93 64k test are recovered, reducing the word error to 
11.2% from 11.8%. 
BREF: BREF\[14\] is a large read-speech corpus, contain- 
ing over 100 hours of speech material, from 120 speakers 
(55m/65f). The text materials were selected verbatim from 
the French newspaper Le Monde, so as to provide alarge vo- 
cabulary (over 20,000 words) and a wide range of phonetic 
environments\[7\]. The material in BREF was selected to 
maximize the number of different phonemic contexts. 5 Con- 
taining 1115 distinct diphones and over 17,500 triphones, 
BREF can be used to train vocabulary-independent acous- 
tic models. The text material was read without verbalized 
punctuation using the verbatim prompts. 6 
5This is in contrast to the WSJ texts which were selected so as to contain 
only words in the most frequent 64,000 words in the original text material. 
6Another difference between BREF and WSJ0 is that the prompts for

We have previously reported results using only a small 
portion (2770 sentences from 57 speakers) of the available 
training material for BREF\[3, 5, 4\]. In these experiments, 
the amount of training data has been extended to 38,550 sen- 
tences from 80 speakers. The amount of text material used 
for LM training has also been increased to 38M words, en- 
abling us to estimate trigram LMs. Vocabularies containing 
the most frequent 5k and 20k words in the training mate- 
fial are used and bigram and trigram LMs were estimated 
for both vocabularies. 200 test sentences (25 from each of 
8 speakers) for each vocabulary were selected from the de- 
velopment test material for a closed vocabulary test. The

velopment test data using the 5k/20k LM is 106/178 (which 
can be compared to 96/196 for WSJ computed under the 
same conditions with the 5k/20k-open LM). An additional 
200 sentences were used for a 20k-open test set. As en- 
sured by the prompt selection process, the prompt exts were 
distinct from the training prompts. 
Word recognition results for the 5k test are given in Table 4 
with bigram and trigram LMs estimated on the 38M-word 
normalized text material from Le Monde. With 428 CD 
models trained on the si57 sentences, the word error is 12.6%. 
Using an order of magnitude more training data (si80) and 
1747 CD models, the word error with the bigram is reduced 
by 28% to 9.1%. The use ofa trigram LM gives an additional 
36% reduction of error. 
Results for the 20k test are given in Table 5 using the 
same acoustic model sets and LMs, for both closed and open 
vocabulary test sets. For the closed vocabulary test, the si80 
training data gives an error reduction of 20% over the si57 
WSJ0 were normalized, where for BREF the prompts were presented as 
they appeared in the original text. This latter approach as since been 
adopted for the recordings of WSJ1. However, while for WSJ1 orthographic 
transcriptions are provided, for BREF the only reference currently available 
is the prompt ext. 
training. The use of the trigram LM reduces the word error 
by an additional 26%. The 20k-open test results are given 
in the lower part of the table. 3.9% of the words are OOV 
and occur in 72 of the 200 sentences. We observe almost a 
50% increase in word error, with a three-fold increase in the 
word insertions compared with the closed vocabulary test. 
Thus apparently the OOV words are not simply replaced by 
another word, but are more often replaced by a sequence of 
words. The trigram LM only reduces the word error by 15% 
on this test. 
D ISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 
The recognizer has been evaluated on 5k and 20k test 
data for the English and French languages using similar style 
corpora. It should be pointed out however, that although 
the Nov92 5k WSJ test data and the BREF 5k test data were 
closed-vocabulary, the conditions are not quite the same. For 
WSJ, paragraphs were selected ensuring not more than one 
word was out of the 5.6k most frequent words \[ 19\], and these 
additional words were then included as part of the vocabulary. 
For BREF, a lexicon was first constructed containing the 
5k/20k most frequent words, and sentences covered by this 
vocabulary were selected from the development test material. 
The situation was slightly different for the Nov93 5k test in 
that the prompt texts were not normalized, and therefore 
several OOV words (0.3%) occurred in the test data despite 
it being a closed-vocabulary test. 
However, looking at the recognition results for individual 
speakers, it appears that interspeaker differences are much 
more important than differences in perplexity, and perhaps 
more than language differences. Just considering the rela- 
tionship between speaking rate and word accurracy, in gen- 
eral, speakers that are faster or slower than the average have a 
higher word error. It has been observed that the better/worse 
speakers are the same on both the 5k and 20k tests. 
We have observed some language dependencies, such as 
the higher number of homophones in BREF, which has the 
effect of reducing the efficiency of the search and the large 
number of frequent monophone words which results in larger 
networks. At the same time, the phone accuracy for BREF 
is better than that for WSJ, which speeds up the search. 
Improving the model accuracy, at the acoustic level and at 
the language model evel, by taking advantage of the avail- 
able gaining data, has led to better system performance. For 
both WSJ and BREF increasing the amount of training ut- 
terances by an order of magnitude reduces the word error 
by about 30%. By using larger training text materials it is 
possible to train a trigram LM which was incorporated in a 
second acoustic pass. The trigram pass gives an error rate 
reduction of 20% to 30%. The combined error reduction is 
on the order of 50%. 
It remains a general problem of how to define comparable 
test conditions for different languages. This may even de- 
pend on the definition of a word in a given language, which 
is linked to the lexical coverage. A primary aim of the afore- 
mentioned LRE Sqale project is to address this issue.
