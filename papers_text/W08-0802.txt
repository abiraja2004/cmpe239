Abstract 
In this paper we present a wearable, headset 
integrated eyes- and hands-free speech-to-
speech (S2S) translation system. The S2S sys-
tem described here is configured for translin-
gual communication between English and 
colloquial Iraqi Arabic. It employs an n-gram 
speech recognition engine, a rudimentary 
phrase-based translator for translating recog-
nized Iraqi text, and a rudimentary text-to-
speech (TTS) synthesis engine for playing 
back the English translation. This paper de-
scribes the system architecture, the functional-
ity of its components, and the configurations 
of the speech recognition and machine transla-
tion engines.  
1 Background 
Humanitarian personnel, military personnel, and 
visitors in foreign countries often need to commu-
nicate with residents of a host country. Human in-
terpreters are inevitably in short supply, and 
training personnel to speak a new language is diffi-
cult. Under the DARPA TRANSTAC and Babylon 
programs, various teams have developed systems 
that enable two-way communication over a lan-
guage barrier (Waibel et al, 2003; Zhou et al, 
2004; Stallard et al, 2006). The two-way speech-
to-speech (S2S) translation systems seek, in prin-
ciple, to translate any utterance, by using general 
statistical models trained on large amounts of 
speech and text data.  
The performance and usability of such two-way 
speech-to-speech (S2S) translation systems is 
heavily dependent on the computational resources, 
such as processing power and memory, of the plat-
form they are running on. To enable open-ended 
conversation these S2S systems employ powerful 
but highly memory- and computation-intensive 
statistical speech recognition and machine transla-
tion models. Thus, at the very minimum they re-
quire the processing and memory configuration of 
common-of-the-shelf (COTS) laptops.  
Unfortunately, most laptops do not have a form 
factor that is suitable for mobile users. The size, 
weight, and shape of laptops render them unsuit-
able for handheld use. Moreover, simply carrying 
the laptop can be infeasible for users, such as mili-
tary personnel, who are already overburdened with 
other equipment. Embedded platforms, on the 
other hand, offer a more suitable form factor in 
terms of size and weight, but lack the computa-
tional resources required to run more open-ended 
2-way S2S systems. 
In previous work, Prasad et al (2007) reported 
on the development of a S2S system for Windows 
Mobile based handheld computers. To overcome 
the challenges posed by the limited resources of 
that platform, the PDA version of the S2S system 
was designed to be more constrained in terms of 
the ASR and MT vocabulary. As described in de-
tail in (Prasad et al, 2007), the PDA based S2S 
system configured for English/Iraqi S2S translation 
delivers fairly accurate translation at faster than 
real-time.  
In this paper, we present ongoing development 
work on an S2S system that runs on an even more 
constrained hardware platform; namely, a proces-
sor embedded in a wearable headset with just 32 
MB of memory. Compared to the PDA based sys-
10
tem described in (Prasad et al, 2007), the wearable 
system is designed for both eyes- and hands-free 
operation. The headset-integrated translation de-
vice described in this paper is configured for two-
way conversation in English/Iraqi. The target do-
main is the force protection, which includes sce-
narios of checkpoints, house searches, civil affairs, 
medical, etc.   
In what follows, we discuss the hardware and 
software details of the headset-integrated transla-
tion device. 
2 Hardware Platform  
The wearable S2S system described in this paper 
runs on a headset-integrated computational plat-
form developed by Integrated Wave Technologies, 
Inc. (IWT). The headset-integrated platform em-
ploys a 200 MHz StrongARM integer processor 
with a total of just 32MB RAM available for both 
the operating system and the translation software. 
The operating system currently running on the 
platform is Embedded Linux. 
There are two audio cards on the headset plat-
form for two-way communication through separate 
audio input and output channels. The default sound 
card uses the headset integrated close-talking mi-
crophone as an audio input and the second audio 
card can be used with an ambient microphone 
mounted on the device or an external microphone. 
In addition, each headset earpiece contains inner 
and outer set of speakers. The inner earpiece 
speakers are for the English speaking user who 
wears the headset, whereas the outer speakers are 
for the foreign language speaker who is not re-
quired to wear the headset. 
3 Software Architecture 
Depicted in Figure 1 is the software system archi-
tecture for the headset-integrated wearable S2S 
system. We are currently using a fixed-phrase Eng-
lish-to-Iraqi speech translation module from IWT 
for translating from English to Iraqi. In the Iraqi-
to-English (I2E) direction, we use an n-gram ASR 
engine to recognize Iraqi speech, a custom, phrase-
based ?micro translator? for translating Iraqi text to 
English text, and finally a TTS module for convert-
ing the English text into speech.  The rest of this 
paper focuses on the components of the Iraqi-to-
English translation module. 
 
Fixed point ASR Engine: The ASR engine uses 
phonetic hidden Markov models (HMM) with one 
or more forms of the following parameter tying: 
Phonetic-Tied Mixture (PTM), State-Tied Mixture 
(STM), and State-Clustered-Tied Mixture (SCTM) 
models. 
For the headset-integrated platform, we use a 
fixed-point ASR engine described in (Prasad et al, 
2007). As in (Prasad et al, 2007) for real-time per-
formance we use the compact PTM models in both 
recognition passes of our two-pass ASR decoder. 
Phrase-based Micro Translator: Phrase-based 
statistical machine translation (SMT) has been 
widely adopted as the translation engine in S2S 
systems. Such SMT engines require only a large 
corpus of bilingual sentence pairs to deliver robust 
performance on the domain of that corpus. How-
ever, phrase-based SMT engines require significant 
amount of memory, even when configured for me-
dium vocabulary tasks. Given the limited memory 
on the headset platform, we chose to develop in-
stead a phrase-based ?micro translator? module, 
which acts like a bottom-up parser. The micro-
translator uses translation rules derived from our 
phrase-based SMT engine. Rules are created auto-
matically by running the SMT engine on a small 
training corpus and recording the phrase pairs it 
used in decoding it. These phrase pairs then be-
come rules which are treated just as though they 
had been written by hand. The micro translator 
currently makes no use of probabilities.  Instead, as 
shown in Figure 2, for any given Arabic utterance, 
the translator greedily chooses the longest match-
ing source phrase that does not overlap a source 
phrase already chosen. The target phrases for these 
source phrases are then output as the translation. 
These target phrases come out in source-language

order, as no language model is currently used for 
reordering.  
The micro translator currently consists of 1300 
rules and 2000 words. Its memory footprint is just 
32KB. This small memory footprint is achieved by 
representing the rules in binary format rather than 
text format.  
 
 
English Playback using TTS: To play the Eng-
lish translation to the headset user we developed a 
rudimentary TTS module. The TTS module parses 
the output of the I2E translator to extract each 
translated word. It then uses the list of extracted 
words to read the appropriate pre-recorded (or syn-
thesized) audio. Once the word pronunciations au-
dio files are read we splice the beginning and the 
end of the audio files to reduce the amount of si-
lence and concatenate them into a single file which 
is then played to the user on the inner earphone 
speakers. 
The total memory footprint of our current Iraqi 
to English translation module running on the head-
set-integrated platform is just 9MB. The current 
configuration of the translation module?s Iraqi 
ASR engine yields word error rate (WER) of 20% 
on test-set utterances without out-of-vocabulary 
(OOV) words.  
4 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper we have presented the initial setup of 
a speech-to-speech translation system configured 
for the headset platform. Our current work is fo-
cused on expanding the vocabulary of the Iraqi-to-
English translation module by exploiting the rich 
morphology of Iraqi Arabic. In particular, we are 
investigating the use of morphemes (prefix, stems, 
and suffixes) for expanding the effective vocabu-
lary of the headset translator. We are also develop-
ing use cases for performing a formal evaluation of 
both the usability and performance of the headset 
translator.
