Abstract
This paper presents a procedure for extract-
ing transfer rules for multiword expressions
from parallel corpora for use in a rule based
Japanese-English MT system. We show that
adding the multi-word rules improves transla-
tion quality and sketch ideas for learning more
such rules.
1 Introduction
Because of the great ambiguity of natural language,
it is hard to translate from one language to another.
To deal with this ambiguity it is common to try to
add more context to a word, either in the form of
multi-word translation patterns (Ikehara et al, 1991)
or by adding more context to the translations in sta-
tistical MT systems (Callison-Burch et al, 2005).
In this paper, we present a way to learn large
numbers of multi-word translation rules from either
dictionaries or parallel text, and show their effec-
tiveness in a semantic?transfer-based Japanese-to-
English machine translation system. This research
is similar to work such as Nichols et al (2007). The
novelty lies in (i) the fact that we are learning rules
from parallel text and (ii) that we are learning much
more complex rules.
In Section 2, we outline the semantic transfer ma-
chinery and we introduce the DELPH-IN machine
translation initiative that provided the resources used
in its construction. We describe in more detail how
we learn new rules in Section 3, and show their ef-
fect in Section 4. We briefly discuss the results and
outline future work in Section 5 and, finally, we con-
clude this paper in Section 6.
2 Semantic transfer
All experiments are carried out using Jaen, a se-
mantic transfer based machine translation system
(Bond et al, 2011). The system uses Minimal Re-
cursion Semantics (MRS) as its semantic representa-
tion (Copestake et al, 2005). The transfer process
takes place in three steps. First, a Japanese string is
parsed with the Japanese HPSG grammar, JACY. The
grammar produces an MRS with Japanese predicates.
Second, the Japanese MRS is transferred into an En-
glish MRS. And finally, the English HPSG grammar
ERG generates an English string from the English
MRS.
At each step of the translation process, stochastic
models are used to rank the output. There is a cutoff
at 5, so the maximal amount of generated sentences
is 125 (5x5x5). The final results are reranked using
a combined model (Oepen et al, 2007).
While JACY and the ERG have been developed
over many years, less effort has been put into the
transfer grammar, and this component is currently
the bottleneck of the system. In general, transfer
rules are the bottleneck for any system, and there
is a long history of trying to expand the number of
transfer rules types (Matsuo et al, 1997) and tokens
(Yamada et al, 2002).
In order to increase the coverage of the system
(the number of words that we can translate) we build
rules automatically. We look at strings that have
a high probability of being a translation (identified
from parallel corpora), and see if they fit a pattern
defined in the transfer grammar. A very simple pat-
tern would be that of a noun predicate being trans-
ferred as another noun predicate. The transfer rule
type for this pattern is given in (1). The type makes
92
sure that the LBL and the ARG0 values are kept when
the relation is transferred, while the PRED value is
left underspecified.1

A linguistically more interesting transfer rule is
that for PP ? Adjective transfer (see (3)), which
takes as input 3 relations (the first for the noun, the
second for the postposition, and the third for the
quantifier of the noun, all properly linked), and out-
puts one relation (for the adjective), for example of
an angle ? angular, to give an English-to-English
example. The output adjective relation is given the
same handle, index and external argument as the in-
put postposition, so that the semantic linking with
the rest of the MRS is preserved. In this way, modi-
fiers of the PP will modify the Adjective, and so on.
The use of this transfer rule is demonstrated in Sec-
tion 3.1.2
1the LBL (label) of the relation is a tag, which can be used to
refer to the relation (conventionally written with an h for han-
dle). The ARG0 is the index of the relation. Nouns and deter-
miners have referential indices (conventionally written with an
x), while adjectives and verbs have event indices (written with
an e).
2The HCONS feature has as value a list of qeq constraints
(equality modulo quantifiers), which function is to express that
the label of a relation is equal to a handle in an argument posi-
tion (without unifying them).

3 Procedure
We are using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and
Anymalign (Lardilleux and Lepage, 2009) to gener-
ate phrase tables from a collection of four Japanese
English parallel corpora and one bilingual dictio-
nary. The corpora are the Tanaka Corpus (2,930,132
words: Tanaka (2001)), the Japanese Wordnet Cor-
pus (3,355,984 words: Bond et al (2010)), the
Japanese Wikipedia corpus (7,949,605),3 and the
Kyoto University Text Corpus with NICT transla-
tions (1,976,071 words: Uchimoto et al (2004)).
The dictionary is Edict, a Japanese English dictio-
nary (3,822,642 words: Breen (2004)). The word
totals include both English and Japanese words.
We divided the corpora into development, test,
and training data, and extracted the transfer rules
from the training data. The training data of the four
corpora together with the Edict dictionary form a
parallel corpus of 20 million words (9.6 million En-
glish words and 10.4 million Japanese words). The
Japanese text is tokenized and lemmatized with the
MeCab morphological analyzer (Kudo et al, 2004),
and the English text is tokenized and lemmatized
with the Freeling analyzer (Padr? et al, 2010), with
MWE, quantities, dates and sentence segmentation
turned off.
When applying GIZA++ and Anymalign to the
lemmatized parallel corpus they produced phrase ta-
bles with 10,812,423 and 5,765,262 entries, respec-
tively, running GIZA++ with the default MOSES
settings and Anymalign for approximately 16 hours.

oto Articles: http://alaginrc.nict.go.jp/WikiCorpus/
index_E.html
93
We filtered out the entries with an absolute fre-
quency of 1,4 and which had more than 4 words on
the Japanese side or more than 3 words on the En-
glish side. This left us with 6,040,771 Moses entries
and 3,435,176 Anymalign entries. We then checked
against the Jacy lexicon on the Japanese side and the
ERG lexicon on the English side to ensure that the
source and the target could be parsed/generated by
the MT system. Finally, we filtered out entries with a
translation probability, P(English|Japanese), of less
than 0.1. This gave us 1,376,456 Moses entries and
234,123 Anymalign entries. These were all phrase
table entries with a relatively high probability, con-
taining lexical items known both to the parser and
the generator.
For each of these phrase table entries, we looked
up the lexemes on either side in the Jacy/ERG lexi-
cons, and represented them with the semantic predi-
cate (and their syntactic category).5 Ambiguous lex-
emes were represented with a list of predicates. We
represented each possible surface rule with a list of
all possible semantic predicate rules. So a possible
surface rule with two (two times) ambiguous lexi-
cal items would give four possible semantic rules, a
possible surface rule with three (two times) ambigu-
ous lexical items would give eight possible seman-
tic rules, and so on. A total of 53,960,547 possible
semantic rules were created. After filtering out se-
mantic transfer rules containing English predicates
of probability less than 0.2 compared to the most
frequent predicate associated with the same surface
form, this number was reduced to 26,875,672.6 Each
of these rules consists of two ordered lists of seman-
tic predicates (one for Japanese and one for English).
From these possible semantic transfer rules, we
extracted transfer rules that fitted nine different pat-
4The absolute frequency number can, according to Adrien
Lardilleux (p.c.), be thought of as a confidence score. The
larger, the more accurate and reliable the translation probabili-
ties. 1 is the lowest score.
5As shown in (2), predicates reflect the syntactic category of
the lexical item by means of an infix, e.g. ?_n_? for noun.
6We used a profile of the English training data from the
Tanaka Corpus and the Japanese Wordnet Corpus, parsed with
the ERG grammar, to find the probability of each English pred-
icate, given its surface form. For example the word sleep is
assigned the predicate "_sleep_n_1_rel" 103 times, the predi-
cate "_sleep_v_1_rel" 89 times, and "_sleep_v_in_rel" 2 times.
Hence, semantic transfer rules containing the first two are ac-
cepted, while rules conataining the last are filtered out.
terns. We extracted 81,690 rules from the Moses en-
tries, and 52,344 rules from the Anymalign entries.
The total number of rules extracted was 97,478.
(36,556 rules overlapped.) Once the rule templates
have been selected and the thresholds set, the entire
process is automatic.
The distribution of the extracted rules over the
nine patterns is shown in Table 1.
In the first three patterns, we would simply see if
the predicates had the appropriate ?_n_? and ?_a_?
infixes in them (for nouns and adjectives respec-
tively). 82,651 rules fitted these patterns and were
accepted as transfer rules. The last six patterns were
slightly more complex, and are described below.
3.1 PP? adjective
Japanese PPs headed by the postposition? no ?of?
often correspond to an adjective in English as illus-
trated in (4).
(4) a. ??
small.size
?
of
small
b. ??
music
?
of
musical
In order to extract transfer rules that fit this pat-
tern, we checked for possible semantic rules hav-
ing two predicates on the Japanese side and one on
the English side. The first Japanese predicate would
have the infix ?_n_? (be a noun), and the second
would be ?_no_p_rel? (the predicate of the postpo-
sition ?). The sole English predicate would have
the infix ?_a_? (be an adjective).
3.2 PP? PP
Japanese PPs headed by the postposition ? de
?with/by/in/on/at? are, given certain NP comple-
ments, translated into English PPs headed by the
preposition ?by? (meaning ?by means of?) where the
prepositional object does not have a determiner, as
illustrated in (5).

With this particular pattern we get transfer rules
which prevent us from generating all possible trans-
lations of ? (?with?, ?by?, ?on?, ?in?, or ?at?), and
keeps the quantifier unexpressed.
There are many other possible PP?PP patterns,
such as??? start in/on/at/to ?in the beginning?.
We started with one well known idiomatic English
type, but should learn many more.
3.3 Verb + NP? Verb + NP
Japanese MWEs fitting the pattern noun + object
marker (?) + verb usually are translated into En-
glish MWEs fitting one out of three verb + NP pat-
terns, illustrated in (7). In (7a), the NP has an unex-
pressed quantifier. The English pattern in these cases
will be verb + noun. In (7b), the NP has an indef-
inite article. The English pattern will then be verb
+ _a_q_rel + noun. And in (7c), the NP has defi-
nite article. The English pattern will then be verb +
_the_q_rel + noun.

By adding these rules to the transfer grammar, we
avoid generating sentences such as I play the ten-
nis and He took a blame. In addition, we are able
to constrain the translations of the individual words,
greatly reducing the transfer search space
3.4 Noun + Adjective? Adjective
Japanese has a multiword expression pattern that is
not found in English. In this pattern, noun +? (ga)
+ adjective usually correspond to English adjectives,
as shown in (8). The pattern is an example of a dou-
ble subject construction. The Japanese adjective has
its subject provided by a noun, but still takes an ex-
ternal subject. Our transfer rule takes this external
95
subject and links it to the subject of the English ad-
jective.

With the new rules, the transfer grammar now cor-
rectly translates (9) as She is very intelligent. and
not Her head is very good., which is the translation
produced by the system without the new multiword
rules. Notice the fact that the adverb modifying the
adjective in Japanese is also modifying the adjective
in English.

Because of the flexibility of the rule based sys-
tem, we can also parse, translate and generate many
variants of this, including those where the adverb
comes in the middle of the MWE, or where a dif-
ferent topic marker is used as in (10). We learn the
translation equivalences from text n-grams, but then
match them to complex patterns, thus taking advan-
tage of the ease of processing of simple text, but
still apply them flexibly, with the power of the deep
grammar.

3.5 Postp + Noun + Verb? Verb / PP + Verb
? Verb
Japanese has two MWE patterns consisting of a
postposition, a noun, and a verb, corresponding to
a verb in English. The first is associated with the
postposition? no ?of? (see (11)), and the second is
associated with the postposition ? ni ?in/on/at/to?
(see (12)).

??

In (11), the postposition? no ?of?, the noun?
? benkyou ?study?, and the verb?? suru ?make?
are translated as study, while in (12), the postposi-
tion ? ni ?in/on/at/to?, the noun ?? esa ?feed?,
and the verb?? yaru ?give? are translated as feed.
In both MWE patterns, the noun is marked with the
object marker? wo. The two patterns have differ-
ent analysis: In (11), which has the no-pattern, the
postposition attaches to the noun, and the object of
the postposition?? rekishi ?history? functions as
a second subject of the verb. In (12), which has the
ni-pattern, the postposition attaches to the verb, and
the object of the postposition?? kingyo ?goldfish?
is a part of a PP. Given the different semantic rep-
resentations assigned to the two MWE patterns, we
have created two transfer rule types. We will have a
brief look at the transfer rule type for the no transla-
tion pattern, illustrated in (13).7

tice that the ARG1 of the input verb relation is reen-
tered as ARG1 of the output relation ( x1 ), and the
ARG2 of the input postposition relation is reentered
as ARG2 of the output relation ( x2 ). The output re-
lation is also given the same LBL and ARG0 value
as the input verb relation. In this way, the Japanese
MWE is collapsed into one English relation while
semantic links to the rest of the semantic representa-
tion are maintained.
3.6 Summary
Out of the 26,875,672 possible semantic predicate
rules, we extracted 97,478 rules that fitted one of the
nine patterns. These rules were then included in the
transfer grammar of the MT system.
4 Results
The impact of the MWE transfer rules on the MT
system is illustrated in Table 2.
We compare two versions of the system, one with
automatically extracted MWE rules and one with-
out. They both have hand-written MWE and single
word rules as well as automatically extracted sin-
gle word rules extracted from Edict by Nichols et al
(2007).
The additional rules in + MWE are those pro-
duced in Section 3. The system was tested on held
out sections of the Tanaka Corpus (sections 003 to
005). As can be seen from the results, the overall
system is still very much a research prototype, the
coverage being only just over 20%.
Adding the new rules gave small but consistent
increases in both end-to-end coverage (19.3% to
20.1%) and translation quality (17.80% to 18.18%)
measured with NEVA (Forsbom, 2003).8
When we look only at the 105 sentences whose
translations were changed by the new rules the
NEVA increased from 17.1% to 21.36%. Investigat-
ing the effects on development data, we confirmed
that when the new MWE rules hit, they almost al-
ways improved the translation. However, there is
still a problem of data-sparseness, we are missing

instances of rule-types as well as missing many po-
tential rule types.
As an example of the former, we have a pattern
for verb+NP ? verb+NP, but were unable to learn
????? jihi wo negau ?beg for mercy: lit. ask
for compassion?. We had one example in the train-
ing data, and this was not enough to get over our
threshold. As an example of the latter, we do not
currently learn any rules for Adverb+Verb?Verb al-
though this is a common pattern.
5 Discussion and Further Work
The transfer rules learned here are based on co-
occurrence data from corpora and a Japanese-to-
English dictionary. Many of the translations learned
are in fact compositional, especially for the com-
pound noun and verb-object patterns. For exam-
ple, ? ? ?? ana-wo horu ?dig hole? ? dig
a whole would have been translated using existing
rules. In this case the advantage of the MWE rule is
that it reduces the search space, so the system does
not have to consider less likely translations such as
carve the shortages. More interestingly, many of the
rules find non-compositional translations, or those
where the structure cannot be translated word for
word. Some of these are also idiomatic in the source
and target language. One of our long term goals is
to move these expressions into the source and tar-
get grammars. Currently, both Jacy and the ERG
have idiom processing (based on Copestake et al,
2002), but there are few idiomatic entries in their
lexicons. Bilingual data can be a good source for
identifying these monolingual idioms, as it makes
the non-compositionality explicit. An example of
a rule that uses the current idiom machinery is the
(hand-built) rule N-ga chie-wo shiboru ?N squeezes
knowledge??N racks N?s brains, where the subject
is co-indexed with a possessive pronoun modifying
the object: I/You rack my/your brains. Adding such
expressions to the monolingual grammars simplifies
the transfer rules and makes the grammars more use-
ful for other tasks.
In this paper we only presented results for nine
major multi-word transfer rule types. These were
those that appeared often in the training and devel-
opment data. We can straightforwardly extend this
in two ways: by extending the number of rule types

in English. As we are also going from multi-word
to multi-word we expect that there will be even
more than this. Currently, adding another pattern is
roughly an hour?s work (half to make the rule-type in
the transfer engine, half to make the rule matcher in
the rule builder). To add another 100 patterns is thus
6 weeks work. Almost certainly this can be speeded
up by sharing information between the templates.
We therefore estimate that we can greatly reduce the
sparseness of rule-types with four weeks work.
To improve the coverage of rule instances, we
need to look at more data, such as that aligned by
Utiyama and Takahashi (2003).
Neither absolute frequency nor estimated transla-
tion probability give reliable thresholds for deter-
mining whether rules are good or not. Currently
we are investigating two solutions. One is feedback
cleaning, where we investigate the impact of each
new rule and discard those that degrade translation
quality, following the general idea of Imamura et al
(2003). The second is the more traditional human-
in-the loop: presenting each rule and a series of rele-
vant translation pairs to a human and asking them to
judge if it is good or not. Ultimately, we would like
to extend this approach to crowd source the deci-
sions. There are currently two very successful online
collaborative Japanese-English projects (Edict and
Tatoeba, producing lexical entries and multilingual
examples respectively) which indicates that there is
a large pool of interested knowledgeable people.
Finally, we are working in parallel to qualitatively
improve the MWE rules in two ways. The first is to
extend rules using semantic classes, not just words.
This would mean we would need fewer rules, but
each rule would be more powerful. Of course, many
rules are very idiomatic and should trigger on actual
lexemes, but there are many, such as ?????
himei wo negau ?beg for mercy? which allow some
variation ? in this case there are at least three differ-
ent verbs that are commonly used. At a lower level
we need to improve our handling of orthographic
variants so that a rule can match on different forms
of the same word, rather than requiring several rules.
We are working together with the Japanese WordNet
to achieve these goals.
The second approach is to learn complex rules
directly from the parallel text, in a similar way to
(Jellinghaus, 2007) or (Way, 1999). This will be
necessary to catch rules that our templates do not
include, but it is very easy to over-fit the rules to the
translation data. For this reason, we are still con-
straining rules with templates.

Resource Availability
The MWE expression rules made here and the ma-
chine translation system that uses them are avail-
able through an open source code repository. In-
stallation details can be found at http://wiki.
delph-in.net/moin/LogonInstallation. The
code to make the rules is undergoing constant re-
vision, when it settles down we intend to also add it
to the repository.
6 Conclusion
This paper presented a procedure for extracting
transfer rules for multiword expressions from paral-
lel corpora for use in a rule based Japanese-English
MT system. We showed that adding the multi-
word rules improves translation coverage (19.3%
to 20.1%) and translation quality (17.8% to 18.2%
NEVA). We show how we can further improve by
learning even more rules.
