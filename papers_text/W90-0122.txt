Abstract  
The paper shows how it is possible, in the framemork of a 
gygtemle funetlonal g:r~mmat, (SFG) approach to the 
semantics of aatttral language, to generate an output with 
intonation that is motivated semantically and discoursally. 
Most of ~ wurk reported has already been *accuse, fully 
imp lem~4 in GF.N~SY$ (the very large generator of the 
COMMUNAL Pro~eet; see Appendix 1). A major feature 
is that it does am flint generate a syntax tree and words, and 
then impose intonational coatogm on them (as is a common 
aggroaeh in modelling intonation); rather, it generates the 
various intonational feamrta diteetJy, as it is generating richly 
labe.llad m:rucratea (as are typical in SFG), and the associated 
items. ~ claim is not that the model p ~  he,? solves 
all the problems of generating intonation, but that it points 
a way forward that makea natural inks with semantics and 
ditu:ourse. A secondaJty perpoe~ of this paler is to 
demonstraW,, for one of many possible areas of NLO that 
could have been choc~n, that there is still much important 
work to be done in '~nt.e, mev geaeratkm'. I do this tn order 
to tefut? the augge~On, ~easiOnally head at recent 
e e l  that the major wod? io 'sentence generation' has 
already been done, and that the main (only'?) area of 
s/gnifleanee in NLG is ia ltighet level planning. In my 
expea'ieace the two are inteaxlependen% and we should expect 
significant developments at eveey level in the years to come. 
1. Purpose  and  Scope 
The aspect of NoZural Language Generation 
(NLG) to be described here is the generation of 
spoken text that has intonation, where that 
intonation is motivated both semantically (i.e, in 
terms of the semantics - in a broad sense of the 
term to be clarified soon - of sentences) and 
dJscoursally (Le. in terms of vhat the discourse 
p!~..;.ng compotmnt specifies)." Any specification 
of intonation requires, of course, to be integrated 
with an adapted version of a speech synthesizer 
(e.g. one that draws on one of the currently 
available systems that attempts - inevitably with 
Appendix 1 for a brief overview of the project). 
L As will be ?l?ar from what fo l low the model presented 
hcte owes a great deal to two people in particular:. Michael 
Halliday and Pad Teach. Through them, I am well awate, 
there is a debt to many others, too numerous to mention, 
who have worked in the diffvgult field of intonation in 
F~glish. \[ am grateful too for early encouragement i  this 
area from Gillian Brown (whose work is drawn on also by 
Paul Teach), nod for the regular? ongoing stimulus of many 
good explorations of ideas in this and other arco, s with my 
colteagmt Gordon Tucker. But none of there should bc 
blamed for the inevitable crudities, infelicities and no aoubt 
ca'mrs in the model described here; these are mine. 
The approach is very different from that in 
MITalk (Allen 1986), which is essentially a text- 
to-speech system. So far as I am aware, the only 
generative model prior to ours that attempts to 
generate intonation that is motivated semanticaIly 
and discoursaIly is the impressive work of hard, 
Houghton, Pearson and their colleagues at Sussex 
(Houghton and hard 1987) and Houghton and 
Pearson 1988). Its limitation is the very small size 
of its syntax, lexis, semantics and working domain. 
We see our work in the COMMUNAL Project as 
being to build on their important achievement. 
(But see Appendix 2 for what we do not attempt.) 
2. The Relevant Components of the 
Communal Model 
The major components of the overall model that 
will b? referred to below are as follows. We 
assume an Interactive system, rather than one that 
is merely monologue. We shall ignore here the 
components related to parsing, interpretation a d 
inputting to the belief system and planner. The 
components relevant to generation are: 
1. The  bel ief  system, which inc ludes general and 
specific beliefs about ('knowledge of) situations 
and things in some domain; specific beliefs about 
the content of the preceding discourse, about 
vozious aspects of the current social situation, 
about the addressee and his beliefs of all types, 
his attitudes, his goals and plans. 
2. A planner, which makes general plans, drawing 
on knowledge of ... 
3. genres (scripts, schemas, etc), introducing 
where appropriate sub-units uch as transactions 
(see below) and more detailed plans, using ... 
4, the local discourse grammar, which is 
modelled as a 'systemic flowchart' (i.e. a flowchart 
containing many small system networks at the 
choice points, and which generates xchanges and 
their structure), 
5. the lexlcogrammar, i.e. the sentence generator, 
consisting of: 
164 
a. the system networks of semantic features for 
a wide variety of types of mea-;-g related to 
situations and realized in the clause, including 
theme and information structure as well as 
transitivity, mood, negativity, modallty, affeetive 
meaning and logical relationships, and equivalent 
system networks for thiage and qualities, and 
b. the realization rules which turn the selection 
expressions of features that are the output from 
passes through the system networks into syntactic 
structures with Items (grammatical nd lexical) 
and markers of punctuaUou or intonation as their 
term;hal nodes. 
3. Mode l l ing  In tonat ion  
3.1. ,am Overview of the Generation of Intonation 
Let as imagine that Ivy (the 'person' of whose 
ufind GENESYS models a part) is about to 
generate a sentence, Let us suppose that she is 
being consulted by the Personnel Officer of a 
large institution, who draws regularly on her 
specialist knowledge and advice, and that he has 
just asked her Wghere does Peter Piper live?". 
(We shall come later to how intonation is 
represented.) Like most human users of 
language, Ivy makes reasonable assumptions about 
(loosely, she 'knows') where she is in any current 
transaction (e.g. at the start, in the middle or at 
the end), and where she is in the current 
exchange. This affects the pitch level of what she 
says. She needs to choose a tone (the change in 
pitch marked by a stepping or a slide on the tonic 
syllable) which will express the MOOD of the 
final matrix clause of her sentence. ('Matrix' here 
means 'at the top layer of structure'.) She nee& 
to locate that tone on an item which will be 
thereby marked as new Information. She needs to 
decide if it is to be presented simply as 'neW, or 
as 'contrastively new' (in the terms used here). 
And she needs to deride on the Information 
status of any chunks of information that are to be 
presented as separate from the main Information 
ear  of the clause. (The information that guides 
these choices comes from various aspects of the 
higher belief system, which there is unfortunately 
no space to discuss here.) 
As we shaft see, these various components of the 
semantic level of intonation account, in a different 
way from the usual approach in British intonation 
studies, for Halliday% well-known triad of TONE, 
TONALITY and TONICITY. While it is 
perfectly possible m talk about the contrasts in 
intonational form to which these three rder as 
'systems', I suggest hat it is more insightful to 
take, as the level of contrasts to be modelIed in 
system networks, the meanings that lie behind (or, 
ia the SFG metaphor, above them). These 
semantic features are then realized in the purely 
intonational contrasts of TONE, TONICITY and 
TONA.LITY. 
The accounts of the various aspects of intonation 
in what follows will inevitably be introductory, and 
may to the specialist appear simplistic. A 
somewhat fuller treatment is given in Teach and 
Fawcett 1988, and a very fur treatment isgiven in 
Tenth 1987, which includes ummaries ofrelevant 
work by other intonation spe?islists. 
(I omit here, for reasons of space, a specification 
of how one might model the way in which the 
position in a transaction and an exchange affects 
intonation.) 
Let us assume, then, that Ivy is preparing a 
response to the Personnel Officer's question, 
using the information that, while Mr Peter Piper's 
address is currently 11 Romilly Crescent, Canton, 
Cardiff, he is moving from there after one month. 
In discourse planni.g terms, she chooses that her 
move will be a 'support' for a 'solicit information', 
gad that the act at the head of the move is a 'give 
new content ) (see Fawcett, van der Mije and van 
Wissen 1988). As wc shall see, these choices pro. 
select in the MOOD network of the 
lexieegrammar the features \[information\] and 
\[giver\]. But first there is a more basic system to 
consider. 
32. The MODE System 
The inidal rule of the semantics of the lexico- 
grammar to be considered here is: 
situation -> 
"MODE'& 'TENOR'&'CONGRUENCZ~SIT'. 
Thus means that, for any 'situation' ( roughly = 
'proposition') that you are generating, you must 
make choices in all three of the systems named. 
(Notice, then, that 'parallelism' lies at the heart of 
the grammar.) Here we shall be concerned only 
with the MODE system. (It is from CONGR- 
UENCE SIT that the main part of the network 
is entered, to generate configurations of 
participant roles, such as Agent and Affected, and 
choices in MOOD, such as 'information seeker', 
and very many others.) The MODE system is 
very simple: 
'MODE' -> 70% spoken / 30% written. 
This means: 'In the MODE system, you must  
choose between generating a spoken output (for 
which under random generation there is a 70% 
probability) and generating a written output 
(which carries a 30% probability). Clearly, sinc~ 
165 
Ivy is in a spoken interaction, she will be strongly 
disposed to select \[spoken\]. but in principle she 
need not We shall not discuss here the 
interesting reasons for and ~ in~t  introducing this 
system to the lexi?o-grammar itself, except to 
point to two 91~,niEcant advantages that it brings. 
Nor, unfortunately, is there space to discuss the 
roles of the probabilities and the ways in which 
they are assigned (sometimes simply a guess at 
the overall pattern for central types of text; 
somet;mes based on textual studies). 
(The ne,~ few lines presuppose some familiarity 
with systemic grammars; for those without this 
knowledge it may be advisable to re-read this 
section after seeing the working of the examples.) 
What is the role of this system? Fh'st, it enables 
the grammat-builder to refer, at any point on this 
initial pass through the system network, to 
whichOver feature in this system has been chosen 
as an entry condition to a later system. In other 
words, where there is greater richness of choice in 
me aning in the spoken mode (as is typically the 
case with m~nings real|Ted in intonation, as 
gain.st those reAI;~,~d in punctuation), we can 
ensure that those systems are only entered when 
the feature \[spoken\] has been chosen. We shall 
shortly see the great value of this. Second, the 
'MODE' system enables us to refer, at any point 
in a realization rule, on this or any subsequent 
pass through the network, to this feature as a 
conditional feature for the realization of some 
othex feature, In other words, we can ensure that 
if \[spoken\] has been chosen the realization will 
take the form of intonation, and if \[wrkten\] has 
been chosen it is expressed in punctuation. Both 
of these faclh'fies contribute greatly to the elegant 
operation of the lexieogramm~tr as a whole, both 
in me~nin~ r?91h'?d ill intonation and in many 
other ways. 
3.3. The Sentence Generator= MOOD 
The unmarked choice in the 'CONGRUENCE 
SIT' system is, unsurpri~ngly, \[congruent_sill. 
This is the choice that opens up the whole array 
of me~-;,~gs a.~sociated with realization in a 
clause, and many parallel systems follow. Among 
these is the MOOD network. This is a fairly 
large and complex network of meanings, and 
these are re~l;-ed partly in syntax, partly in items 
(such as "please'), and partly in tone (= variation 
in pitch). The network is too large and complex 
to present here, but we shall trace a route through 
it that shows why it is central to an understan,4;-g 
of intonation. The first options in the current 
GENESYS network are shown below: 
congruent sit-> 
'TRANgITIVITY' & 'MOOD (& OTHERS). 
'MOOD(A)' -> 90% information / 10% directive. 
information -> 'MOOD(B)' & 
'TIME REFERENCE POINT' (& OTHERS). 
m 
'MOOD(B)' -> 
70% giver (1.2) / 30% seeker (16). 
The second line reads:' In the MOOD(A) system 
you must choose between the feature 
\[information\], which overall has a 90% probability 
of being selected, and \[directive\], which has only 
a 10% probability. As so often, the choice of a 
single feature leads to further parallel systems, 
one of which continues the MOOD network itself. 
The last line in the above rules exemplifies the 
use of numbers in brackets after the features; it is 
the number of the realization rule for the feature 
concerned. What will this look like? 
Here is a slightly simplified version of the 
realization rule for \[giver\]: 
1.2 : giver : 
if falls 'Z' and (simplex sit or 
final co ordinated situation) 
ten  on r st3,ass  itten then 'E' < "!')"'. 
if on,~first_pass poken then 'E' < 
The. effect of this rule is on the 'Ender' (i.e. 'E', 
the last element in the structure of the clause). If 
\[written\] is chosen in the 'MODE' system it is 
expounded by a full stop (Br. E. for 'period'), but 
if the choice is \[spoken\] it is expounded by a final 
intonation unit boundary, i.e. \[. However, says the 
rule, neither realization will occur unle~ the 
clause (1) directly fdls the element 'Sentence' 
(represented by'Z' a~ an approximation to sigma) 
and (2) is 'simplex ~,i.e. is not co~ordinated with 
one or more other clauses or, if it is, is the final 
clause. 
This may seem a surpr/~gly complex rule to 
those in NIP used to working with mini- 
grammars. But this is typical of the working level 
of complexity in a natural anguage, and those 
who ate used to working with the problems of 
building broad coverage grammars will appreciate 
that this is not a particularly complex rule. In the 
case of our example the effect is to give to Ivy's 
output a final intonation unit boundary. 
We come next to an example of the value of being 
able to use of the feature \[spoken\] as an entry 
condition to a system. This is necessary because 
the MOOD network also builds in variables in 
'key' (in the sense of HaRiday 1970); i.e. finer 
choices w/t h;. the MOOD options. These 
correspond to what Tench treats separately as 
variations in attitude. While accepting the 'view 
that these more delicate choices can be seen as 
166 
serving a separate ftmction from the function of 
the basic tone, the fact is that in any systemic 
computational implementation the way in which 
they enter the choice systom is simply us more 
delicate choices that are directly dependent on the 
broad choice of meaning realized in the broad 
tone. The range of such delicate variations 
appears to be potentially different for the various 
meani,o~ (see further below). In the systems 
given below, note ~ high probability of choosing 
\[assertive\] followed by \[neutral\]. 
giver & spoken -> 
70% assertive / 15% deferring (1.21) / 
15% withjeservation (1.22). 
assertive. > 2% very strong (L23) / 8% strong 
(1.24) / 60% neutral (1.25) / 30% mild (1.26). 
In an intermediate level model (such as Prototype 
Generator 2 (PG2), which is the most advanced 
version of GENESYS currently implemented) we 
need only relatively simple rules such as the 
following: 
1.21 : deferring: 
if fills 'Z' and on first p~ spoken and 
(simplex sit or\]inal~co~,rdinated situation) 
then '2-' by 'NT. 
('lq'I" = 'Nuclear Tonic'; see 3.4.3.) 
1.22 : with reservation : 
if fills '~' and on_first_pa~ss poken and 
(simplexsit or fmaI_co-ordinated skuation) 
then 'L2' by 'hiT '. 
And so on, for \[very strong\] (realized by '21'), 
\[strong\] (realized by ~?'), \[neutral\] (realized by 
T)  and \[mild\] (realized by '1-'). 
Here we are using a numerical notation for tones 
that goes back to an earlier tradition even than 
Hall\[day's description (1967, 1970), though it has 
much in common with Hallida/s. (Readers from 
the American traditiOn used to an iconic 
representation may hate some adjustments to 
make in interpreting the notation. But there 
should be act fundamental diffu:ulty; Hallida/s 
description has been widely used (and indeed 
tested) on American and Canadian English.) 
I give next a brief summary of the differences 
between the scheme for tones used here and 
Hall\[day's well-lmown scheme (1967, 1970). 
Tench's (and so my) numbers '1' and '2' 
correspond to HoJliday's usage, as do the use of 
'+' and '-'. But Halt\[day% 'Tone 3' is seen as a 
variant of our Tone 2; Hallida/s Tone 4 (a fall. 
rise) is represented by '12'; and his 'Tone 5 (a 
ris~fall) is shown as '21'. Tench's general 
descriptions of the tones in words (1987) imply 
167 
four pitch level.% and I therefore use the following 
labels for the model implemented: base, low, mid 
and high. The four levels in turn provide a 
framework for describing three types of pitch 
change. It will be helpful for what follows to set 
them out as three 'scales'; these descriptions of 
the tones are in effect source material for writing 
realization rules. (1 have given these scales 
informal semantic labels; these are not intended 
to correspond irectly to the features in the 
MOOD network encountered sofar, but to evoke 
features from various parts of the network, 
including the many options dependent on 
\[directive\]). F;uaily, let me remind yon that we 
are not at this point trying to account for all 
tones, but only for those that carry the MOOD of 
a matrix simplex or final clause. This dear 
separation of the ways in which tones are 
generated is a key feature of the present 
proposals. We shall come shortly to some of the 
ways of generating appropriate tones for some of 
the other positions in which tones occur. 
The 'assertive' scale (Tones 21 and 1): 
Tone 21: rise-fall (rise to high plus fall to base) 
Tone 1 +: high-fall (fall from high to base) 
Tone 1: mid-fall (fall from mid to base) 
Tone 1-: low-fall (fall from low to base) 
Also (see below): 
Tone 21.: low rise.fall (lower version of Tone 
21)* 
The 'deferring' scale (Tone 2): 
Tone 2+: high.rise (rise from base to high) 
Tone 2: mid-rise (rise from base to mid) 
Tone 2-.: low-rise (rise from base to low) 
The 'implication' scale (Tone 12): 
Tone 12: fall-rise 
Also (see below): 
Tone 12-: low fall-rise (lower version of 12)* 
* Tench suggests that these are variants of Tone 
21 and 12 that additionally signal 'emotional 
involvement'. 
As will be clear, Tench and I propose a 
modification to HaUiday% basic set of contrasts 
in TONE, such that Hallida/s Tone 5 is seen as 
an extreme form of Tone 1. This fits naturally 
with the semantics of these tones. In a somewhat 
similar way, Tench treats Hallida/s Tone 3 (a low 
rise) as a variant of Hall\[day's Tone 2, under the 
rubric of 'deference tothe listener', and we adopt 
this too in COMMUNAL But note that, while 
that kind of semantic description holds good for 
Tone 2s (Hall\[day% Tone 3s) in the sentence-final 
position, I shall suggest other means of generating 
them in non-final positions. In the present system 
there are no 'double tone groups', such as 
Hall\[day's Tone 13 (i.e. a Tone I to realize the 
main MOOD meaning, followed by a Tone 3 
(here 2) for 'supplementary information'.) Such 
final Tone 2s will be generated in a similar way to 
that to be illustrated in section 3.5 below for 
initial Tone 3s (and, as we shaU see, 12s). Finally, 
note that I include h~e one option that Tench 
includes under 'stat~ of information'. This is his 
'implication', re~l;~?d in Tone 12, i.e. a fall-rise. 
This is Halliday~s Tone 4, which he characterizes 
as (among other descriptions) 'with reservation'. 
This tone occurs both as a carrier of MOOD and 
otherwise; it is with the former tiutt we are 
concerned here. It seems plausible to treat it as 
a variant hat can be chosen as an alternative to 
the basic falling and rising tones recognized by 
both Halliday and Tench, and 1 have therefore 
incorporated it in the overall MOOD network. 
3.4. Focus of Information 
3.4.1. The Line of Approach to the Problem 
I shall present here a somewhat novel approach to 
the relationship between the two sets of 
phenomena described by both Halliday and Tench 
as TONALITY and TONiCITY, TONALITY is 
typically thought of as 'cutting up a string of 
words into intonation ,mirA' ~ench's term; 
Halllday's is 'tone groups'), with each intonation 
unit realizing one information unit. The 
problem, when one is approaching the question 
from the angle of generation, is that there is no 
string of words to eat up - not, that is, until the 
senten~ has been generated. We therefore need 
to look for a semanfl? approach to the problem, 
My proposal is that it is helpful to start not with 
TONAL ITY  but TONICITY. 
TONICITY is the placing of the tonic on a 
syllable. The item so markfd is shown to be 
being presented as new Information - and !h{s iS 
a semantic concept. ('New' information is 
information presented as 'not recoverable.') But 
a further problem arises, in that linguists 
reccgni*e both 'marked' and '~1~marked' tonicity. 
3.4.2. Generating Marked Tonidty 
Marked tonidty occurs when the item cont~;-i-g 
the tonic syllable is presented by the speaker as 
'contrastivcly new'. Unmarked toniclty occurs 
when there is no marked tonicity (which is by far 
the most mual case); we shatl return to this 
shortly. Marked tonidty is handled in GENESYS 
ha the following way. In principle, any pathway 
through the system network that results in the 
generation of a formal item will lead to a system 
of the following form (where  is the current 
terminal feature): 
x- > notcontrastively_new / contrastively_new. 
The realiTafion of \[contrastively..new\] is that a 
contrastive tonic is conflated with the element of 
structure that the item expotmds. TI~ fimple 
version implemented in PG2 is as follows: 
' INFORMATION FOCUS'-> 
99% no element marked as contrastively.new \] 
1% elementmar'fked_as..~ont'rastively..new. 
element marked as contrastively new-> 
50% ~ontrast~e newness on_.~larity (18.1) / 
50% contrastiv~newnes~on process (18.2) / 
0% other. 
Realization rule 18.1 states the complex set of 
conditions for conflating a eontrastive tonic ('CT') 
with the appropriate element; for the POLARITY 
system ('positive' vs. 'negative') this is typically the 
Operator (which may have to be supplied by a 
'do-support' rule) but it may be any one of several 
others, depending on whether or not the clause is 
moodless and, if not, whether a directive, and if 
not, what auxiliaries are realized, etc. The rule 
for presenting the 'process' (realized in the Main 
verb) as 'contrastively_nmv' is however extremely 
simple: 
18.2 : contrastlve newness_ on_.process : 
'CT' by 'M'. 
In the case of our c~mple, the choke is not to 
present any clement as conttrasfively new. 
3.4.3. Generat;.~g Unmarked Tonicity 
How, then, should we generate unmarked 
tonicity? The answer is simple: as the default -
i.e. when there is no contrastive tonic, in other 
words, I want to suggest that ~mmarked tonicity is 
a formal phenomenon f intonation that does not 
express an active choice in meaning.. The relevant 
facts are well known, i,e., roughly, that what we 
hero term a nuclear tonic ('biT') fails on the last 
lexical item in the information unit. The question 
is: 'How can we define the intonation unit, in 
semantic terms?' The only contender as a 
semantic unit, in the GENF.SYS framework, isthe 
situation, i.e. the semantic unit typically rvalizcd 
in the c law.  The actual decision as to which 
item the unmarked tonic shall be assigned to gets 
made relatively late in the generation process. In 
GENESYS we simply have a list of the few dozen 
items generated by the lexicogrammar that cannot 
carry the unmarked tonic: roughly, the 
'grammatical items' of English. Essentially, then, 
this default rule will insert one, and only one, 
nuclear tonic in each sentence. This will hold 
even when there are two or more co-ordinated 
clauses in that sentence, and/or one or more 
168 
embedded dames. 
3-q. Slams of Information 
3_5.1. The Importance of this Category 
This is a concept not disting~j;shed as a separate 
phenomenon in Halliday's ~eatment ofintonation, 
but which Tench does treat separately. This dear 
separation oftwo semantically distinct phenomena 
was a significant help in developing the generative 
model proposed here. However the concept of 
'status of information' is quite highly generalised, 
in the seine that it is not manifested in just one 
part of the overall network (as for example 
MOOD is). Specifically, we fred this option at 
many of the points where a unit is generated that 
is not the final matrix clause in the sentence. 
Many of these ( thou# by no means all) have 
already been implemented in GENESYS, and the 
following are a representative sample. 
3.5.2. The Co-ordination of Situations and Things 
One major source of multiple intonation units is 
co-ordination. Thus, when GENESYS generates 
co-ordinated clauses (realizing co-ordinated 
sltuatione) such as "Either Ivy loves Ike, or she 
loves Fred, or she doesn't love anybody.', she first 
recognizes at an abstract level that separate 
information Units are being assi~ed and then 
inserts, depending on whether the output is to be 
spoken or written, either (1) commas or (2) 
intonation trait boundaries and an appropriate 
tone such as Tone 2. We shall trot re .educe 
here the surprisingly large system network and 
realization rules for this area of the grammar, 
which merit a paper to themselves. All that needs 
to be said is that to develop amodel of clause co- 
ordination that incorporates most of the 
phenomena ofnaturally occurring texts is a major 
task and that it took several mouths of work to 
buikl our current system. In terms of the above 
example, it generates, if \[spoken\] has been 
selected: 
J either Ivy loves Ike/NT/2 \[ 
or she loves Fred/NT/2 \[ 
or she doesn't love anybody/NT/1 \] 
While the patterns of the networks and their 
realizations are different for the co-ordination of 
nominal grOUpS, they are handled in a s;milar way. 
The system accommodates the perhaps urprising 
fact that, in the case of nominal groups, there is 
typically one more intonation unit than there 
would be commas. As in the MOOD network, 
there is a greater number of delicate choices 
re~_li~ed in intonation than there is in punctuation, 
So the feature \[spoken\] is again used as an entry 
cond i t ion  to the sys tem in the 
'CO ORDINATION SIT'network, toensure that 
the ~stera is not unread unless \[spoken\] has been 
chosen. Here the speaker chooses in the system of 
\ [unmarked  co ord inat ion  spoken\ ]  vs. 
Ice ordination with reservationS.. The first is 
realised by a Irene 2 base-to-mid rme; Halliday's 
Tone 3), and the second by a Tone 12 (fall-rise; 
HaUiday's Toue 4), 
3.5.3. Thematized Circumstances: Situations, 
Things, Qualities 
Another major source of additional intonation 
units is the thematizatlon of time and 
drcumstanee. These meanings are realized in 
Adjuncts of various types. They may occur in 
various places ha the clause, and here we shall 
consider just those that appear at the beginning of 
a clause. So far GENESYS includes eleven types, 
each of which may be realized by either a clause 
or a group (three different classes of groups being 
reco~ized: nominal, prepositional nd quantity- 
quall~ groups). Note, theah that we have now 
identi~d a second major source of what has been 
termed 'clause ?omb;ningL A similar approach is
needed for 'dame final' dames, i.e. clauses that 
fill any of the ecleven types of Adjunct built into 
GENESYS so far, and that come late in the 
clause. (This is a different approach to clause- 
combining from that in Halliday 198.5 and so from 
that in the Nigel grammar at ISI; here such 
clauses are simply treated as embedded - so far 
with gains in generalizations rather than losses.) 
Let us take as an e~mple the concept of time 
position, which is one of five types of 
'circumstance of time' reco~niTed in GENF.SYS - 
the others being repetition, duration, periodic 
frequency, and usuality. While GENESYS will 
happily generate dames such as "until he leaves 
the company" to specify a time position, iu the 
case of our example Ivy has chosen the simpler 
structure of the prepositional group, i.e. "until next 
month". The first system to consider is: 
'TIME POSITION TI-IEMATIZATION"-> 
99%-~thematize-d timeposition (20.2) / 
i% thematizedJim'~ Ixffifion (20.3). 
Because the answer modifies the presuppositions 
that the Personnel Officer brought to his question 
(i.e. that Peter Piper had a fixed address), Ivy 
decides to thematize the part of her reply that 
expresses this, i,e. her specification of the 'time 
position'. This is realized by placing the 'time 
position Adjunct' at an early place in the clause. 
(Note that this is not a 'movement rule'; there are 
no such rules in this generator, and no element is 
located until it can be located in its correct place.) 
The next two systems are: 
169 
thematized time_position-> 
80% tim~..pos~io a as separate 
information un iT / -  
20% time_.lXm"/ion as_part of main 
information unit. - -  - - - 
spoken & time_position as separate 
information unit-> - - 
20% high!i~ted thcmatized time_position / 
S0% ~utnil3heTaatizccLti~ ix,/ition. 
The first of the two systems appfies whether or 
not the MODE is spoken or written (the written 
realization being a comma). But the writing 
system cannot make the distinction offered in the 
second, so that here again the feature \[spoken\] 
from the erR|hal MODE system is used as an 
entry condition. In our example Ivy chooses to 
 resent the specification of the time position "nntil last week") as a separate information umt, 
and furthermore to klshlight it (by using a Tone 
12 (a fall-rise). 
But you may have noticed that these features have 
no realization rules. How, then, do these choices 
get realized? The answer is that these features 
act as condit ional features on the realization rules 
for the units that are generated, after re-entry to 
the overall network, on a subsequent pass though 
it. The reason for including the system at the 
rsnk of situation is that in this way we can capture 
the genexalisa6on that these options are relevant 
whatever the unit - a clause or some kind of 
group - that fills the Adjunct. 
In our case the sub-network that we fred ourselves 
in on re-entry is the network for 
'MINIMAL RELATIONSHIP PLUS THING', 
i.e. the netv~k from which prepositional groups 
are generated. Here we enter the following 
system (where the suffix 'mrpt' echoes the name 
of the overall system): 
location mrpt-> 
place-mrpt (90.001) / time_mrpt (90.002). 
Here \[time..mrpt\] will be In'e-selected by the 
choice at the higher rank. The part of its 
realization rule concerned with intonation may 
appear, once again, somewhat complex, but once 
again it seems to correspond to the relative (but 
always limited) complexity of the facts of how 
English works: 
90.002 : time_mrpt : 
if  (on_prev ious_pass  
time_position as separat? information unit 
and on first_l~ass'spoken )- 
theni l l  current unit pgp then e < "\['9, 
if on prc'~ous pass 
highlighted_thematized time position 
then '12' by 'T ~, 
' if on_previous_pass 
neutral thematized time_position 
then '2' by 'T. 
As you will see, these rules insert appropriate 
intonation boundaries and tones. The tonic ('T') 
is already waiting in the starting structure of the 
tnepositional group, so that the rule ~;mply 
conflates the actual tone with it. Let us assume 
that Ivy, in order to highlight still further the 
thematization f the words " month', selects the 
highfighting rather than the neutral option. (The 
nominal group "next month" is generated by a 
further e-entry.) Finally, the system supplies the 
initial intonation unit boundary for any unit 
without one. If we assume that the rest of items 
generated (in components not considered in this 
paper) are "he will be living at eleven Romilly 
Crescent, Canton" the full output for our example 
is: 
\] until next month/T/12 \[ he will be living at 
eleven Romilly Crescent/T/2 I Canton/NT/1 i 
3.5.4. Other Sources of Intonation 
Other sources of intonation occur in specialist 
mini-grammars such as those for dates and 
addresses. These can be quite complex, and may 
insert several tonics, each with an appropriate 
tone. Our worked example illustrates one such 
case: note the Tone 2 on "Crescent". Yet other 
types will be included in the next version of 
GENESY$, including (1) Adjuncts (which may be 
filled by clauses or groups) that are placed after 
the nuclear tonic of a clause and which carry 
'supplementary information', and (2) 'non- 
restrictive relative clauses' (i.e. ones that carry, 
once again, 'supplementary information'), 
3.6. Summary of the lexicogrammatical 
generation of intonation 
We have now completed a fairly fuU specification 
of the major aspects of intonation included at the 
present stage of the development of the 
GENESYS model. 
To summarize: GENESYS offers the choice, on 
entering the first system that results in the 
generation of a scntenco, between \[written\] and 
\[spoken\]. The importance of this apparently 
trivial system is that the choice made in it 
determines whether or not one can go on to enter 
quite a number of more 'delicate' systems whose 
choices are realized in intonation. Its features 
also act as conditions on the realization of 
features chosen in the same network, or in one 
entered on a subsequent pass. The result is that 
the realization at the level of form will be in 
170 
terms of either intonation or punctuation. We 
have seen how choices in MOOD, in 
INFORMATION FOCUS and in various types of 
'status of informaBon' contribute together to the 
specification ofintonation, and we have seen some 
of the details of how this can be implemented. 
The result is an integrated model that avoids the 
psychologically implausible approach whereby one 
first generates a syntax tree and a string of words 
at its leave% and then 'adds on' the intonation. 
Instead, it treats intonation as one of three modes 
of re8i|Tation (the other two being syntax and 
items),, generating the various aspects of 
iatonatmn at appropriate points in the generation 
of syntax and items. 
R may be helpful to conclude by specifying 
explicitly the final stages of this process. First the 
generator looks for a eontrastive tonic ('CT') with 
which to confiate the tone., and then, if there isn't 
one, it provides as a default anuclear tonic ('NT') 
for the flail matrix clause, i.e.. the intonational 
element of structure with which the tone reollzln~ 
the me a,; ,g of MOOD is conflated. The other 
intonation units specified by various types of 
Information status are fitted around this central 
framework, receiving tones appropriate to their 
status. Where they are clauses these tones will be 
eonflated with a nuclear tonic (unless, of course, 
there is a contrastive tonic), and where they are 
groups the tones will be conflated with a simple 
tonic A nuclear tonic is thus one that is 
potentially capable of r0ceiviag the type of tone 
that re~!i~,?s a MOOD option. It should be made 
clear that, in every case of the location of a 
nuclear tonic or a simple tonic, the element with 
which it is conflated must be one that is not 
exponndcd by an item from the list of inherently 
weak items. (Any such item may of course still 
receive a tonic by being contrastively stressed, as 
in l he has/C'r/t+ eaten it I.) 
4. Conc lus ions  
4.1, Overall Summary 
The COMMUNAL project began with a hope 
that it would be possible to take the insights from 
a Hatlidayan-Tenchian view of intonation, and to 
develop a computational adaptation and 
implementation f them. A promising overall 
approach to the problem has indeed been 
developed; much of the resulting model has been 
worked out in considerable detail; and many large 
and significant portions have been implemented 
computationa!iy. The framework has proved itself 
to be adaptable when modifications are indicated, 
and there is good reason to hope that aspects not 
as yet worked out expficitly will prove to be 
solvable in the framework of the present model. 
There is, therefore, the exciting prospect hat, 
when our sister project gets under way and 
provides the necessary complementary 
components (no doubt with some requirements on
us to adapt our outputs to their needs) we shatl 
be in a position to offer a relatively full model of 
speech with diseoursally and semantically 
motivated Intonation. It will. moreover, be a 
principled model, and we hope that it will be 
capable of further extension and of fme.t, ni, g. 
We feel that the use of SFG. and specifically of 
the type that separates clearly system networks 
and realization rules (as in GENESYS), gives us 
a facility that is sensitive to the need for both 
extension and fine-t~m;-g. Above all, the 
centrality in the model of choice between 
semantic features makes it a natural formalism 
for relating the 'sentence grammar' to higher 
components in the overall model. 
4.2. The General Prospect in NiX; 
Finally, let me turn to a more general point, h 
appears that, incr~;ngly over the last few years, 
the focus of interest for many researchers in NLG 
has switched from what we might term sentence 
generation to hi~her level planning (which I term 
discourse 8eneraflon). It is here, one sometimes 
hears it said, that 'all the really interesting work' 
is being done. Going implicitly with r hk eJ~im is 
the assumption, which I have occasionally heard 
expressed quite explicitly, that the major problems 
of sentence generation have been solved. 
But is this really so? While a lot of very 
impressive work has been done, and while some 
quite large generators have been built (e.g. as 
reported in McDonald 1985, Mann and 
Mathiessen 1985, Fawcett 1990), very many major 
problems remain unresolved. Specifically, many 
important aspects of 'sentence gr~rnrnar ~ emain 
outside the scope of current generators. Where, 
for e~mple, will we fmd a full description of a 
semanticaRy and/or pragmatically motivated 
model of even such a wen-known syntactic 
phenomenon as the relative clause? And what 
about comparative constructions (where even the 
linguistics fiterature is weak)? And there are 
many, many more areas of the semantics and 
syntax of sentences where our models are still far 
from adequate. There are also many issues of 
model construction regarding, for example, the 
optimal division of labour between components, 
the outh'ni,g of which deserves a separate paper 
(or book). And, even if we had models that 
covered all these and the many other areas 
competently, we have hardly begun the process of 
developing adequate methods for the comparison 
and evaluation of models. Thus there is still an 
enormous amount of challenging and fascinating 
171 
work to do before we can say with any confidence 
that we have an~hing like adequate sentence 
generators. (A senior figure in German NLP 
ch'des uggested atCOLING '88 that one can buy 
good sentence generators off the shelf. It depends 
how good 'good' is*.) 
In this paper I have Ulustrated two crucial points: 
(1) that there are indeed significant areas of 
language not yet adequately covered in current 
generators, and (less dearly because I have had to 
omit the relevant section for reasons of space) (2) 
that the development of an adequate model of 
these depends on the eeaeerrent development of 
discourse and sentence generators. 
Clearly, while there are in e~dstence a number of 
fairly large sentence generators, we have in no 
way reached a situation where no further work 
needs to be done. I am aware, as the director of 
a project hat seeks to provide rich coverage for 
as much of English as possible, that we have a 
great deal of work still to do, and that this holds 
for the sentence generator component as weft as 
for the discourse planning systems. GE~qESYS 
already has 50% more systems than the NIGEL 
(in the long established Pe~am~n Project; see 
Appendix 1), but our rough estimate is that we 
need to make it at least as large again before we 
have an~hlng approaching full grammatical 
coverage. And, of course, as everyone who has 
wrestled seriously with genuine natural language 
knows, many tricky problems will remain even 
then. Fmding anything like the 'right' solution to 
many of these ~ require, I claim, models that 
have developed, m dose interaction with each 
other, their discourse planning and their sentence 
generation components and their belief 
relYresentation, including befiefs about the 
addressee.

Appendix 1 
COMMUNAL is a major research project hat 
applies and develops Systemic Functional 
Grammar (SFG) in a very large, fully working 
computer program. The acronym COMMUNAL 
stands for COnvivial Man-Machine 
Understanding through NAtural Language. The 
prindples underlying the project are set out in 
172 
Fawcett 1988, and an illustration of a generation 
is presented inTucker 1989. A fuller (but fairly 
informal) overall description., incl.uding some 
comparison with other proiects, ts gtven ia 
Fawcett 1990. See also Fawcett (to appear). The 
project is planned to last 5 years, with around 6 
researchers working on it. We finished the 
SUccessful Phase I in 1989, and now (May 1990) 
are getting under way on Phase 2 The central 
component ofthe overall system is the generator, 
built at Cardiff. This is called GENESYS 
(because it GE.NErates SYStemically). 
ConUdbutions from the University of Leeds in 
Phase 1 were to build (1) a derived probabilisti? 
parser, called the RAP (for Reafistie Annealing 
Parser, which develops earlier work at Leeds), 
and (2) the inte~reter (called REVELATION, 
because it reveals the 'meaning' from the 
'wozding'). Each of these is a major development 
ia its field. But because both buiM di~ealy on the 
relevant aspects of GFENESYS, we can 
characterise the coverage of the COMMUNAL 
system as a whole in terms of the fxze of 
GENESYS. 
Here is a quotation and a few facts to give you a 
perspective on COMMUNAL at the end of Phase 
L McDonald, Vaughan and Pustejovsky 
(1987:179), in referring to the Penman project at 
the University of S. California, say:. 'Nigel, 
Penman's grammar .... is the largest systemic 
grammar and possibly the largest machine 
grammar of any kind.' Although the 
COMMUNAL team developed GENESYS 
completely independently, starting from scratch 
with new system networks and handIing 
realization i  a rather different way, GENESYS 
already has many more systems than NigeL (This 
is not a criticism of Nigel; the research team have 
been working on other components of Penman). 
A major theoretical difference between the two is 
that the networks in GENESYS are more 
explicitly oriented to semantics than in Nigel. We 
make the assumption that the system networks in 
the lexicogrammar are the semantic options. 
GENF_.SYS has around 600 semantic systems 
realized in grammar (syntax and morphology, and 
also intonation and punctuation (see below), while 
Nigel has about 400 grammatical systems. But 
GENESYS additionally does something that the 
builders of Nigel would have liked to do, but from 
which they have so far been prevented (by the 
requirement of a sponsor): it integrates system 
networks for vocabulary with the networks 
realized grammaticatly. GENESYS is still 
growing, so that in Phase 2 we estimate that it wiU 
more than double the number of systems r?~liTed 
in syntax and grammatical items. This should 
enable it to handle something approaching 
unrestricted syntax. COMMUNAL's first major 
achievement is therefore the size and scope of 
G~YS.  The second must he seen in the 
wider framework of the model as a whole. It has 
been a long-standlng goal of ~ to build a large 
scale system that uses the same grammar to 
either generate or interlmet a sentence. (Many 
current systems use a different grammar for each 
process.) The second major achievement is to 
have performed this task with a very large 
grammar - a Systemic l~mction~d Grammar. in 
this case. (This will be the subject of a separate 
paper in the future.) A third achievement 
(though one less relevant in the present context) 
has been the development of a probabilisti? 
parsex by the Leeds part of the COMMUNAl. 
team. 
Append ix  2 
'Intonation' is a term susceptible to a wide range 
of interpretations. It may therefore be useful to 
list some major aspects of the complex task of 
generating natural intonation that will not be 
discussed here. The first four are not covered 
because they lie outside the current goals of the 
COMMUNAL project, while the last two are 
omitted because they will be implemented (we 
expect) by a sister project, support for which is 
currently being negotiated. 
1. We shall not be concerned with the high level 
pla, , i ,? that will tailor the text to the needs of 
the addressee as affected by the e.ha,,~! (e.g~ to 
build in greater redundancy, in the form of 
repetition of subject matter in planning what to 
express overtly, act by act). (For the general 
notion of tailoring, see Paris 1988.) 
2. We shall not discuss variation in intonatlonal 
characteristics of the sort that distingahh between 
speakers of different dialects (geographical, social 
class, age, etc). 
3. The same goes for individual variation, i.e. 
intonational idleleet. 
4. We shall ignore the code of tone of voice 
('angry', 'conciliatory', 'delighted', etc). At the 
same tlme we recognize that it is an important 
semiotic system in its own right, and that in the 
longer run the way ia which it is, as it were, 
superimposed onthe intonation systean itsdf must 
be modelled. We recogniTe too the problems of 
drawing a firm line between tone of voice and 
some of the quite delicate distinctions that we 
shall recognise in the MOOD system (c.f. 
Halliday% 1970 term 'key'). 
5. We shaft ignore any aspect of intonational 
variation that does not realize meaning. For 
eaample, it may be that speakers introduce 
semantically ,,-motivated variation into the pre- 
tonic segment of an intonation unit, in order to 
avoid monotony (of. Hoase and Johnr.on 1987). 
(An alternative hypothesis, of course, might be 
that such variation is in fact semanticaUy 
motivated, but that we have not yet discovered 
what aspects of meaning it correlates with and 
how best to refer to it; this is a charaeterisrie of 
much interpersonal me~-;-g,) 
6. We shall not be concerned here with the 
physical implementation f the output, but simply 
(if only it were ~;mpleI) with providing a written 
teat output marked appropriately for input to the 
system which will integrate it with the speech 
synthesis representation of the segmental 
phonology.
