The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions in
the Task of Automatic Interpretation of
Nominal Phrases and Compounds:
A Cross-Linguistic Study

University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign
In this article we explore the syntactic and semantic properties of prepositions in the context
of the semantic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds. We investigate the problem
based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of six languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French,
Portuguese, and Romanian. The focus on English and Romance languages is well motivated.
Most of the time, English nominal phrases and compounds translate into constructions of the
form N P N in Romance languages, where the P (preposition) may vary in ways that correlate
with the semantics. Thus, we present empirical observations on the distribution of nominal
phrases and compounds and the distribution of their meanings on two different corpora, based
on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer?s set of eight prepositions and our list of 22
semantic relations. A mapping between the two tag sets is also provided. Furthermore, given a
training set of English nominal phrases and compounds along with their translations in the five
Romance languages, our algorithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them
to unseen test instances for semantic interpretation. Experimental results are compared against
two state-of-the-art models reported in the literature.
1. Introduction
Prepositions are an important and frequently used category in both English and Ro-
mance languages. In a corpus study of one million English words, Fang (2000) shows
that one in ten words is a preposition. Moreover, about 10% of the 175 most frequent
words in a corpus of 20 million Spanish words were found to be prepositions (Almela
et al 2005). Studies on language acquisition (Romaine 1995; Celce-Murcia and Larsen-
Freeman 1999) have shown that the acquisition and understanding of prepositions in
languages such as English and Romance is a difficult task for native speakers, and
even more difficult for second language learners. For example, together with articles,
prepositions represent the primary source of grammatical errors for learners of English
as a foreign language (Gocsik 2004).

Although the complexity of preposition usage has been argued for and documented
by various scholars in linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics,
very few studies have been done on the function of prepositions in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. The reason is that prepositions are probably the most
polysemous category and thus, their linguistic realizations are difficult to predict and
their cross-linguistic regularities difficult to identify (Saint-Dizier 2005a).
In this article we investigate the role of prepositions in the task of automatic seman-
tic interpretation of English nominal phrases and compounds. The problem is simple to
define: Given a compositional noun phrase (the meaning of the phrase derives from the
meaning of the constituents) constructed out of a pair of nouns, N1 N2, one representing
the head and the other the modifier, determine the semantic relationship between the
two nouns. For example, the noun?noun compound family estate encodes a POSSESSION
relation, while the nominal phrase the faces of the children refers to PART-WHOLE. The
problem, although simple to state, is difficult for automatic semantic interpretation.
The reason is that the meaning of these constructions is most of the time implicit (it
cannot be easily recovered from morphological analysis). Interpreting nominal phrases
and compounds correctly requires various types of information, from world knowledge
to lexico-syntactic and discourse information.
This article focuses on nominal phrases of the type N P N and noun compounds
(N N) and investigates the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of six
languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian. The choice of
these constructions is empirically motivated. In a study of 6,200 (Europarl1) and 2,100
(CLUVI2) English token nominal phrase and compound instances randomly chosen
from two English?Romance parallel text collections of different genres, we show that
over 80% of their Romance noun phrase translations are encoded by N P N and N N
constructions. For instance, beer glass, an English compound of the form N1 N2, trans-
lates into N2 P N1 instances in Romance: tarro de cerveza (?glass of beer?) in Spanish,
bicchiere da birra (?glass for beer?) in Italian, verre a` bie`re (?glass at/to beer?) in French, copo
de cerveja (?glass of beer?) in Portuguese, and pahar de bere (?glass of beer?) in Romanian.
In this article, in addition to the sense translation (in italics), when relevant we also
provide the word-by-word gloss (in ?parentheses?). Moreover, we use N1, N2 to denote
the two lexical nouns that encode a semantic relation (whereN1 is the syntactic modifier
and N2 is the syntactic head), and Arg1, Arg2 to denote the semantic arguments of the
relation encoded by the two nouns. For example, beer glass encodes a PURPOSE relation
where Arg1 (beer) is the purpose of Arg2 (?glass?; thus ?glass (used) for beer?).
We argue here that the syntactic directionality given by the head-modifier relation
(N1 N2 in noun compounds and N2 P N1 in nominal phrases) is not always the same
as the semantic directionality given by the semantic argument frame of the semantic
relation. Otherwise said, N1 does not always map to Arg1 and N2 to Arg2 for any given
relation.
Languages choose different nominal phrases and compounds to encode relation-
ships between nouns. For example, English nominal phrases and compounds of the

form N1 N2 (e.g., wood stove) and N2 P1 N1 (e.g., book on the table) usually translate
in Romance languages as N2 P2 N1 (e.g., four a` bois in French ? ?stove at/to wood?,
and livre sur la table ? ?book on the table?). Romance languages have very few N N
compounds and they are of limited semantic categories, such as TYPE (e.g., legge quadro
in Italian ? ?law framework? ? translates as framework law). Besides the unproductive
N N and the productive N P N phrases, Romanian also uses another productive con-
struction: the genitive-marked noun?noun compounds (e.g., frumuset?ea fetei ? beauty-
the girl-GEN ? translated as the beauty of the girl). Whereas English N N compounds
are right-headed (e.g., framework/Modifier law/Head), Romance compounds are left-
headed (e.g., legge/Head quadro/Modifier). Moreover, the Romance preposition used in
the translations of English nominal phrase instances of the type N P N is one that comes
closest to having overlapping semantic range as intended in the English instance, but
may not be the exact counterpart for the whole semantic range. For example, Committee
on Culture translates as Comisio?n de la Cultura (Spanish) (?Committee of the Culture?),
Commission de la Culture (French) (?Committee of the Culture?), Commissione per la Cul-
tura (Italian) (?Committee for the Culture?), Comissa?o para Cultura (Portuguese) (?Com-
mittee for Culture?), and Comitet pentru Cultura? (Romanian) (?Committee for Culture?).
Even those Romance prepositions that are spelled ?de? are pronounced differently in
different Romance languages.
Thus, the focus on nominal phrases and compounds in English and Romance lan-
guages is also motivated linguistically. The extension of this task to natural languages
other than English brings forth both new insights and new challenges. The Romance
prepositions used in the translations of English nominal phrases and compounds, may
vary in ways that correlate with the semantics. Thus, Romance language prepositions
will give us another source of evidence for disambiguating the semantic relations in
English nominal phrases and compounds. We argue that, in languages with multiple
syntactic options such as English (N N and N P N) and Romanian (N N, genitive-
marked N N, and N P N), the choice between such constructions in context is governed
in part by semantic factors. For example, the set of semantic relations that can be
encoded by pairs of nouns such as tea?cup and sailor?suit varies with the syntactic
construction used. In English, while the noun?noun compounds tea cup and sailor suit
encode only PURPOSE, the N P N constructions cup of tea and suit of the sailor encode
CONTENT-CONTAINER (a subtype of LOCATION) and MEASURE relations and POSSES-
SION, respectively. Similarly, in Romanian both tea cup and cup of tea translate only as
the N P N instance ceas?ca? de ceai (?cup of tea?), while sailor suit translates as costum de
marinar (?suit of sailor?) and the suit of the sailor as the genitive-marked N N costumul
marinarului (?suit-the sailor-GEN?). Thus, we study the distribution of semantic relations
across different nominal phrases and compounds in one language and across all six
languages, and analyze the resulting similarities and differences. This distribution is
evaluated over the two different corpora based on two state-of-the-art classification tag
sets: Lauer?s set of eight prepositions (Lauer 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.
A mapping between the two tag sets is also provided.
In order to test their contribution to the task of semantic interpretation, preposi-
tions and other linguistic clues are employed as features in a supervised, knowledge-
intensive model. Furthermore, given a training set of English nominal phrases and
compounds along with their translations in the five Romance languages, our algo-
rithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them to unseen test instances
for semantic interpretation. As training and test data we used 3,124 Europarl and
2,023 CLUVI token instances. These instances were annotated with semantic relations
and analyzed for inter-annotator agreement. The results are compared against two
187
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
state-of-the-art approaches: a supervised machine learning model, semantic scattering
(Moldovan and Badulescu 2005), and a Web-based unsupervised model (Lapata and
Keller 2005). Moreover, we show that the Romanian linguistic features contribute more
substantially to the overall performance than the features obtained for the other Ro-
mance languages. This is explained by the fact that the choice of the linguistic construc-
tions (either genitive-marked N N or N P N) in Romanian is highly correlated with their
meaning.
The article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of related work.
In Section 3 we describe the general approach to the interpretation of nominal phrases
and compounds and list the syntactic and semantic interpretation categories used
along with observations regarding their distribution in the two different cross-linguistic
corpora. Sections 4 and 5 present a learning model and experimental results. Section 6
presents linguistic observations on the behavior of English and Romanian N N and
N P N constructions. Finally, in Section 7 we provide an error analysis and in Section 8
we offer some discussion and conclusions.
2. Previous Work
2.1 Noun Phrase Semantic Interpretation
The semantic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds in particular and noun
phrases (NPs) in general has been a long-term research topic in linguistics, computa-
tional linguistics,3 and artificial intelligence.
Noun?noun compounds in linguistics
Early studies in linguistics (Lees 1963) classified noun?noun compounds on purely
grammatical criteria using a transformational approach, criteria which failed to account
for the large variety of constraints needed to interpret these constructions. Later on, Levi
(1978) attempted to give a tight account of noun?noun interpretation, distinguishing
two types of noun?noun compounds: (a) compounds interpreted as involving one of
nine predicates (CAUSE, HAVE, MAKE, USE, BE, IN, FOR, FROM, ABOUT) (e.g., onion
tears encodes CAUSE) and (b) those involving nominalizations, namely, compounds
whose heads are nouns derived from a verb, and whose modifiers are interpreted as
arguments of the related verb (e.g., a music lover loves music). Levi?s theory was cast
in terms of the more general theory of Generative Semantics. In that theory it was
assumed that the interpretation of compounds was available because the examples were
derived from underlying relative clauses that had the same meanings. Thus, honey bee,
expressing the relation MAKE, was taken to be derived from a headed relative a bee
that makes honey. Levi was committed to the view that a very limited set of predicates
constituted all of the relations that could hold between nouns in simple noun?noun
compounds. This reductionist approach has been criticized in studies of language use
by psycholinguists (Gleitman and Gleitman 1970; Downing 1977) who claim that noun?
noun compounds, which are frequent in languages like English, encode in principle an
3 In the past few years at many workshops, tutorials, and competitions this research topic has received
considerable interest from the computational linguistics community: the Workshops on Multiword
Expressions at ACL 2003, ACL 2004 and COLING/ACL 2006; the Computational Lexical Semantics
Workshop at ACL 2004; the Tutorial on Knowledge Discovery from Text at ACL 2003; the Shared Task on
Semantic Role Labeling at CONLL 2004 and 2005 and at SemEval 2007.

unbounded number of possible relations. One such example is apple juice seat??a seat
in front of which an apple juice [is] placed? (Downing 1977, page 818)?which can only
be interpreted in the current discourse context.
In this article we tackle the problem using a unified framework. Although we
agree with Downing (1977) that pragmatics plays an important factor in noun?noun
interpretation, a large variety of noun?noun meanings can be captured with a well-
chosen set of semantic relations. Our proposed semantic classification set differs from
that of Levi (1978) in the sense that it contains more homogenous categories. Levi?s
categories, instead, are more heterogeneous, including both prepositions and verbs,
some of which are too general (e.g., the prepositions for, in and the verb to have), and
thus, too ambiguous. Moreover, in our approach to automatic semantic interpretation
we focus on both N N and N P N constructions and exploit a set of five Romance
languages.
Noun?noun compounds in computational linguistics
The automatic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds is a difficult task
for both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Currently, the best-performing
noun?noun interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two
or three-word noun?noun compounds and rely either on ad hoc, domain-specific,
hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or statistical models on large collections of unlabeled
data. Recent results have shown that symbolic noun?noun compound interpretation
systems using machine learning techniques coupled with a large lexical hierarchy
perform with very good accuracy, but they are most of the time tailored to a specific
domain (Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002), or are general
purpose (Turney 2006) but rely on semantic similarity metrics on WordNet (Fellbaum
1998). On the other hand, the majority of corpus statistics approaches to noun?noun
compound interpretation collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun
constituents and use them in a probabilistic model (Lauer 1995). The problem is that
most noun?noun compounds are rare and thus, statistics on such infrequent instances
lead in general to unreliable estimates of probabilities. More recently, Lapata and Keller
(2005) showed that simple unsupervised models applied to the noun?noun compound
interpretation task perform significantly better when the n-gram frequencies are
obtained from the Web (55.71% accuracy4), rather than from a large standard corpus.
Nakov and Hearst (2005) improve over Lapata and Keller?s method through the use of
surface features and paraphrases only for the task of noun?noun compound bracketing
(syntactic parsing of three-word noun compounds) without their interpretation.
Other researchers (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004; Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006;
Pennacchiotti and Pantel 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic
dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections. Kim and Baldwin
(2005) propose a general-purpose method that computes the lexical similarity of unseen
noun?noun compounds with those found in training. More recently Kim and Baldwin
(2006) developed an automatic method for interpreting noun?noun compounds based
on a set of 20 semantic relations. The relations are detected based on a fixed set of
constructions involving the constituent nouns and a set of seed verbs denoting the
semantic relation (e.g., to own denotes POSSESSION). Then all noun?noun instances

as semantic classification categories: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and from.

in transitive sentential contexts (i.e., those sentences containing a transitive verb) are
mapped onto the selected set of constructions based on lexical similarity over the verbs.
However, although the Web-based solution might overcome the data sparsity prob-
lem, current probabilistic models are limited because they do not take full advantage of
the structure and the meaning of language.
From a cross-linguistic perspective, there hasn?t been much work on the automatic
interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds. Busa and Johnston (1996), Johnston
and Busa (1996), and Calzolari et al (2002), for example, focus on the differences
between English and Italian noun?noun compounds. In their work they argue that a
computational approach to the cross-linguistic interpretation of these compounds has to
rely on a rich lexical representation model, such as those provided by FrameNet frames
(Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) and qualia structure (Pustejovsky 1995). In the qualia
structure representation, for example, the meaning of a lexical concept, such as the
modifier in a noun?noun compound, is defined in terms of four elements representing
concept attributes along with their use and purpose. Thus, qualia structure provides
a relational structure that enables the compositional interpretation of the modifier in
relation to the head noun. Two implementations of such representations are provided
by the SIMPLE Project ontology (Lenci et al 2000) and the OMB ontology (Pustejovsky
et al 2006). The SIMPLE ontology, for example, is developed for 12 European languages
and defines entry words that are mapped onto high-level concepts in EuroWordNet
(Vossen 1998), a version of WordNet developed for European languages.
In this article, we use a supervised semantic interpretation model employing rich
linguistic features generated from corpus evidence coupled with word sense disam-
biguation and WordNet concept structure information. The results obtained are com-
pared against two state-of-the-art approaches: a supervised machine learning model,
semantic scattering (Moldovan and Badulescu 2005), and a Web-based unsupervised
model (Lapata and Keller 2005). In this research we do not consider extra cross-linguistic
information, such as semantic classes of Romance nouns (those provided by IS-A re-
lations; e.g., cat belongs to the class of animals) made available, for example, by the
SIMPLE ontology. However, such resources can be added at any time to further improve
the performance of noun?noun interpretation systems.
2.2 Semantics of Prepositions
Although prepositions have been studied intensively in linguistics (Herskovits 1987;
Zelinski-Wibbelt 1993; Linstromberg 1997; Tyler and Evans 2003; Evans and Chilton
2009, among others), they have only recently started to receive more attention in the
computational linguistics community.5 Moreover, the findings from these broad stud-
ies have not yet been fully integrated into NLP applications. For example, although
information retrieval, and even question answering systems, would benefit from the
incorporation of prepositions into their NLP techniques, they often discard them as stop
words.

Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
Prepositions in linguistics
Considerable effort has been allocated to the investigation of spatial prepositions mainly
based on a cognitive approach, not only in English (Herskovits 1987; Linstromberg 1997;
Tyler and Evans 2003; Evans and Chilton 2009), but also in many of the Indo-European
languages (Casadei 1991; Vandeloise 1993; Cadiot 1997; Melis 2002; Luraghi 2003). These
studies provide a detailed analysis of such prepositions trying to give a methodologi-
cal motivated account for the range of their polysemy. These works identify special
constraints on various prepositional patterns, such as semantic restrictions on the noun
phrases occurring as complements of the preposition. For example, in prepositional
phrase constructions such as in NP, the head noun can be a container (in a cup), a
geometrical area (in a region), a geo-political area (in Paris), an atmospheric condition
(in the rain), and so on. These selectional restrictions imposed by the preposition on the
noun phrases it combines with are presented in various formats from lists (Herskovits
1987; Linstromberg 1997) to semantic networks of cluster senses (Tyler and Evans 2003).
In this article we also focus on the polysemy of such prepositions, but we identify the se-
lectional restrictions automatically based on a specialization procedure on the WordNet
IS-A hierarchy. However, unlike Herskovits, we do not consider pragmatic issues such
as relevance and tolerance. These account for the difference that pragmatic motivations
and context dependency make to how expressions are understood. Relevance has to do
with communicative goals and choice of means and is evident, for example, in instances
such as cat on the mat which is still relevant even when only the paws and not the
whole cat are on the mat. Tolerance occurs in situations in which a book, for example,
is described as on the table even though a set of files are placed between it and the
table.
The use of spatial prepositions can also trigger various inferences. For example,
the man at his desk (cf. Herskovits 1987) implies, besides a LOCATION relation, that the
man is using the desk, thus an INSTRUMENT relation. Other inferences are more subtle,
involving spatial reasoning about the actions that can be performed on the arguments
of the preposition. One such instance is infant in a playpen (cf. Tyler and Evans 2003),
where the movement of the playpen involves the movement of the infant. In order to
identify such inferences the automatic interpretation system has to rely on pragmatic
knowledge. In this research we do not deal with such inference issues, rather we identify
the meaning of N P N constructions based on the local context of the sentence.
Prepositions in computational linguistics
In order to incorporate prepositions into various resources and applications, it is neces-
sary to perform first a systematic investigation of their syntax and semantics. Various
researchers (Dorr 1993; Litkowski and Hargraves 2005; Saint-Dizier 2005b; Lersundi
and Aggire 2006) have already provided inventories of preposition senses in English
and other languages. Others have focused on the analysis of verb particles (Baldwin
2006a, 2006b; Villavicencio 2006), the distributional similarity (Baldwin 2005) and the
semantics of prepositions (Kordoni 2005) in a multilingual context, and the meaning
of prepositions in applications such as prepositional phrase attachment (O?Hara and
Wiebe 2003; Kordoni 2006; Volk 2006).
Moreover, although there is a large amount of work in linguistics and computa-
tional linguistics relating to contrastive analysis of prepositions (Busa and Johnston
(1996); Johnston and Busa (1996); Jensen and Nilsson (2005); Kordoni (2005), inter alia),
to our knowledge, there have not been any attempts to provide an investigation of the
prepositions? role in the task of automatic noun phrase interpretation in a large cross-
linguistic English?Romance framework.

3. Linguistic Considerations of Nominal Phrases and Compounds
The meaning of nominal phrases and compounds can be compositional (e.g., spoon
handle?PART?WHOLE, kiss in the morning?TEMPORAL), or idiosyncratic, when the
meaning is a matter of convention (e.g., soap opera, sea lion). These constructions can
also encode metaphorical names (e.g., ladyfinger), proper names (e.g., John Doe), and
dvandva compounds6 in which neither noun is the head (e.g., player?coach).
Moreover, they can also be classified into synthetic (verbal, e.g., truck driver) and
root (non-verbal, e.g., tea cup) constructions.7 It is widely held (Levi 1978; Selkirk 1982b)
that the modified noun of a synthetic noun?noun compound, for example, may be
associated with a theta-role of the compound?s head noun, which is derived from a
verb. For instance, in truck driver, the noun truck satisfies the THEME relation associated
with the direct object in the corresponding argument structure of the verb to drive.
In this article we address English?Romance compositional nominal phrases and
compounds of the type N N (noun?noun compounds which can be either genitive-
marked or not genitive-marked) and N P N, and disregard metaphorical names, proper
names, and dvandva structures. In the following we present two state-of-the-art se-
mantic classification sets used in automatic noun?noun interpretation and analyze their
distribution in two different corpora.
3.1 Lists of Semantic Classification Relations
Although researchers (Jespersen 1954; Downing 1977) argued that noun?noun com-
pounds, and noun phrases in general, encode an infinite set of semantic relations,
many agree (Levi 1978; Finin 1980) there is a limited number of relations that occur
with high frequency in these constructions. However, the number and the level of
abstraction of these frequently used semantic categories are not agreed upon. They can
vary from a few prepositions (Lauer 1995) to hundreds and even thousands of more
specific semantic relations (Finin 1980). The more abstract the category, the more noun
phrases are covered, but also the larger the variation as to which category a phrase
should be assigned. Lauer, for example, classifies the relation between the head and the
modifier nouns in a noun?noun compound by making use of a set of eight frequently
used prepositions: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and from. However, according to this
classification, the noun?noun compound love story, for instance, can be classified both
as story of love and story about love. The main problem with these abstract categories
is that much of the meaning of individual compounds is lost, and sometimes there is
no way to decide whether a form is derived from one category or another. On the other
hand, lists of very specific semantic relations are difficult to build as they usually contain
a very large number of predicates, such as the list of all possible verbs that can link the
noun constituents. Finin, for example, uses semantic categories such as dissolved in to
build interpretations of compounds such as salt water and sugar water.
In this article we experiment with two sets of semantic classification categories
defined at different levels of abstraction. The first is a core set of 22 semantic relations
(SRs), a set which was identified by us from the linguistics literature and from various
experiments after many iterations over a period of time (Moldovan and Girju 2003).
6 The term dvandva comes from Sanskrit, translates literally as ?two-and-two? and means ?pair?.
7 In the linguistic literature the words ?synthetic? and ?root? have been coined for noun?noun compounds.
Because these terms apply also to nominal phrases, we use them in relation to these constructions as well.
192
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
Moldovan and Girju proved empirically that this set is encoded by noun?noun pairs in
noun phrases; the set is a subset of their larger list of 35 semantic relations used in a large
set of semantics tasks. This list, presented in Table 1 along with examples and semantic
argument frames, is general enough to cover a large majority of text semantics while
keeping the semantic relations to a manageable number. A semantic argument frame is
defined for each semantic relation and indicates the position of each semantic argument
in the underlying relation. For example, ?Arg2 is part of (whole)Arg1? identifies the part
(Arg2) and the whole (Arg1) entities in this relation. This representation is important
because it allows us to distinguish between different arrangements of the arguments
for given relation instances. For example, most of the time, in N N compounds Arg1
precedes Arg2, whereas in N P N constructions the position is reversed (Arg2 P Arg1).
However, this is not always the case as shown by N N instances such as ham/Arg2
sandwich/Arg1 and spoon/Arg1 handle/Arg2, both encoding PART?WHOLE. More details
on subtypes of PART?WHOLE relations are presented in Section 6.2. A special relation
here is KINSHIP, which is encoded only by N P N constructions and whose argument
order is irrelevant. Thus, the labeling of the semantic arguments for each relation as
Arg1 and Arg2 is just a matter of convention and they were introduced to provide a
consistent guide to the annotators to easily test the goodness-of-fit of the relations. The
examples in column 4 are presented with their WordNet senses identified in context
from the CLUVI and Europarl text collections, where the specific sense is represented
as the sense number preceded by a ?#? sign.
The second set is Lauer?s list of eight prepositions (exemplified in Table 2) and can
be applied only to noun?noun compounds, because in N P N instances the preposition
is explicit. We selected these two state-of-the-art sets as they are of different size and
contain semantic classification categories at different levels of abstraction. Lauer?s list is
more abstract and thus capable of encoding a large number of noun?noun compound
instances found in a corpus (e.g., many N1 N2 instances can be paraphrased as N2 of

instances encode a CAUSE relation).
In the next section, we present the coverage of these semantic lists on two different
corpora, how well they solve the interpretation problem of noun phrases, and the
mapping from one list to another.
3.2 Corpus Analysis
For a better understanding of the semantic relations encoded by N N and N P N
instances, we analyzed the semantic behavior of these constructions on two large
cross-linguistic corpora of examples. Our intention is to answer questions like:
(1) What syntactic constructions are used to translate the English instances to the target
Romance languages and vice versa? (cross-linguistic syntactic mapping)
(2) What semantic relations do these constructions encode? (cross-linguistic semantic
mapping)
(3)What is the corpus distribution of the semantic relations per each syntactic construction?
(4) What is the role of English and Romance prepositions in the semantic interpretation of
nominal phrases and compounds?
For questions (1) and (2), we expand the work of Selkirk (1982b), Grimshaw
(1990), Giorgi and Longobardi (1991), and Alexiadou, Haegeman, and Stavrou (2007)
on the syntax of noun phrases in English and Romance languages by providing
cross-linguistic empirical evidence for in-context instances on two different corpora
based on the set of 22 semantic tags. Following a configurational approach, Giorgi and
Longobardi, for example, focus only on synthetic nominal phrases, such as the capture
of the soldier (THEME), where the noun capture is derived through nominalization
from the verb to capture. Besides synthetic constructions, we also consider root nominal
phrases and compounds, such as family estate (POSSESSION).
The data
In order to perform empirical investigations of the semantics of nominal phrases and
compounds, and to train and test a learning model for the interpretation of noun?noun
194
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
instances encoded by these constructions, we collected data from two text collections
with different distributions and of different genres, Europarl and CLUVI.
The Europarl data were assembled by combining four of the bilingual sentence-
aligned corpora made public as part of the freely available Europarl corpus. Specif-
ically, the Spanish?English, Italian?English, French?English and Portuguese?English
corpora were automatically aligned based on exact matches of English translations.8
Then, only those English sentences which appeared verbatim in all four language pairs
were considered. The resulting English corpus contained 10,000 sentences which were
syntactically parsed using Charniak?s parser (Charniak 2000). From these we extracted
6,200 token instances of N N (49.62%) and N P N (50.38%) constructions.
CLUVI (Linguistic Corpus of the University of Vigo) is an open text repository of
parallel corpora of contemporary oral and written languages, a resource that besides
Galician also contains literary text collections in other Romance languages. Because the
collection provides translations into only two of the Romance languages considered
here, Spanish and Portuguese, we focused only on the English?Portuguese and English?
Spanish literary parallel texts from the works of Agatha Christie, James Joyce, and H. G.
Wells, among others. Using the CLUVI search interfaces we created a sentence-aligned
parallel corpus of 4,800 unique English?Portuguese?Spanish sentences. The English
version was syntactically parsed using Charniak?s parser (Charniak 2000) after which
each N N and N P N instance was manually mapped to the corresponding translations.
The resulting corpus contains 2,310 English token instances with a distribution of
25.97% N N and 74.03% N P N.
Corpus annotation and inter-annotator agreement
For each corpus, each nominal phrase and compound instance was presented separately
to two experienced annotators9 in a Web interface in context along with the English
sentence and its translations. Because the corpora do not cover some of the languages
(Romanian in Europarl, and Romanian, Italian, and French in CLUVI), three other
native speakers of these languages who were fluent in English provided the translations,
which were added to the list. The two computational semantics annotators had to tag
each English constituent noun with its corresponding WordNet sense.10 If the word was
not found in WordNet the instance was not considered. The annotators were also asked
to identify the translation phrases, tag each instance with the corresponding semantic
relation, and identify the semantic arguments Arg1 and Arg2 in the semantic argument
frame of the corresponding relation. Whenever the annotators found an example encod-
ing a semantic relation or a preposition paraphrase other than those provided, or if they
did not know what interpretation to give, they had to tag it as OTHER-SR (e.g., melody
of the pearl: here the context of the sentence did not indicate the association between the
two nouns; cry of death: the cry announcing death), and OTHER-PP (e.g., box by the wall,
searches after knowledge) respectively.
Tagging each noun constituent with the corresponding WordNet sense in context is
important not only as a feature employed in the training models, but also as guidance
for the annotators to select the right semantic relation. For instance, in the follow-
ing sentences, daisy flower expresses a PART?WHOLE relation in Example (1) and an
8 This version of the Europarl text collection does not include Romanian.
9 The annotators have extensive expertise in computational semantics and are fluent in at least three of the
Romance languages considered for this task.
10 We used version 2.1 of WordNet.
195
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
IS-A relation in Example (2) depending on the sense of the noun flower (cf. WordNet
2.1: flower#2 is a ?reproductive organ of angiosperm plants especially one having
showy or colorful parts,? whereas flower#1 is ?a plant cultivated for its blooms or
blossoms?).
(1) Usually, more than one daisy#1 flower#2 grows on top of a single stem.
(2) Try them with orange or yellow flowers of red-hot poker, solidago, or other late
daisy#1 flowers#1, such as rudbeckias and heliopsis.
In cases where noun senses were not enough for relation selection, the annotators
had to rely on a larger context provided by the sentence and its translations.
Moreover, because the order of the semantic arguments in a nominal phrase or
noun?noun compound is not fixed (Girju et al 2005), the annotators were presented
with the semantic argument frame for each of the 22 semantic relations and were
asked to tag the instances accordingly. For example, in PART?WHOLE instances such
as chair/Arg1 arm/Arg2 the part arm follows the whole chair, whereas in spoon/Arg1
handle/Arg2 the order is reversed. In the annotation process the translators also used
the five corresponding translations as additional information in selecting the semantic
relation. For instance, the context provided by the Europarl English sentence in Exam-
ple (3) does not give enough information for the disambiguation of the English nominal
phrase judgment of the presidency, where the modifier noun presidency can be either
AGENT or THEME in relation to the nominalized noun head judgment. The annotators
had to rely on the Romance translations in order to identify the correct meaning in
context (THEME): valoracio?n sobre la Presidencia (Sp. ? Spanish), avis sur la pre?sidence
(Fr. ? French), giudizio sulla Presidenza (It. ? Italian), veredicto sobre a Preside?ncia (Port. ?
Portuguese), evaluarea Pres?endint?iei (Ro. ? Romanian).
Most of the time, one instance was tagged with one semantic relation, and one
preposition paraphrase (in case of noun?noun compounds), but there were also situa-
tions in which an example could belong to more than one category in the same context.
For example, Texas city is tagged as PART?WHOLE, but also as a LOCATION relation using
the 22-SR classification set, and as of, from, in based on the 8-PP set (e.g., city of Texas,
city from Texas, and city in Texas). Overall, 8.2% CLUVI and 4.8% Europarl instances
were tagged with more than one semantic relation, and almost half of the noun?noun
compound instances were tagged with more than one preposition.
(3) En.: If you do , the final judgment of the Spanish presidency will be even more
positive than it has been so far.
Sp.: Si se hace, la valoracio?n sobre la Presidencia espan?ola del Consejo
sera? au?n mucho ma?s positiva de lo que es hasta ahora.
Fr.: Si cela arrive, notre avis sur la pre?sidence espagnole du Conseil sera
encore beaucoup plus positif que ce n?est de?ja` le cas.
It.: Se ci riuscira`, il nostro giudizio sulla Presidenza spagnola sara` ancora
piu` positivo di quanto non sia stato finora.
Port.: Se isso acontecer, o nosso veredicto sobre a Preside?ncia espanhola sera?
ainda muito mais positivo do que o actual.
Ro.: Daca? are loc, evaluarea Pres?edint?iei spaniole va fi ??nca? mai positiva

Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
Thus, the corpus instances used in the corpus analysis phase have the following
format: ?NPEn; NPEs; NPIt; NPFr; NPPort; NPRo; target?. The word target is one of the
23 (22 + OTHER-SR) semantic relations and one of the eight prepositions considered for
noun compound instances, and one of the 23 semantic relations for N P N instances. For
example, ?development cooperation; cooperacio?n para el desarrollo; cooperazione allo sviluppo;
coope?ration au de?veloppement; cooperac?a?o para o desenvolvimento; cooperare de dezvoltare;
PURPOSE / FOR?.
Inter-annotator agreement was measured using kappa, one of the most frequently
used measures of inter-annotator agreement for classification tasks: K = Pr(A)?Pr(E)1?Pr(E) ,
where Pr(A) is the proportion of times the annotators agree and Pr(E) is the probability
of agreement by chance. The K coefficient is 1 if there is a total agreement among
the annotators, and 0 if there is no agreement other than that expected to occur by
chance.
The kappa values along with percentage agreements obtained on each corpus are
shown in Table 3. We also computed the number of instances that were tagged with
OTHER by both annotators for each semantic relation and preposition paraphrase, over
the number of examples classified in that category by at least one of the judges. For
the instances that encoded more than one classification category, the agreement was
measured on the first relation on which the annotators agreed.
The agreement obtained for the Europarl corpus is higher than that for CLUVI
on both classification sets. Overall, the K coefficient shows a fair to good level of
agreement for the corpus data on the set of 22 relations, with a higher agreement for the
preposition paraphrases. However, according to Artstein (2007), kappa values can drop
significantly if the frequency distribution of the annotation categories in the text corpus
is skewed. This is the case here, as will be shown in the next section. Thus, for a better
understanding of the annotation results we also computed the percentage agreement,
which is indicated for each classification set in parentheses in Table 3.
7.8% of Europarl and 5.7% of CLUVI instances that could not be tagged with
Lauer?s prepositions were included in the OTHER-PP category. From these, 2.1% and
2.3%, respectively, could be paraphrased with prepositions other than those considered
by Lauer (e.g., bus service: service by bus), and 5.7% and 3.4%, respectively, could not be
paraphrased with prepositions (e.g., daisy flower).
In the next section we discuss the distribution of the syntactic and semantic inter-
pretation categories on the two different cross-linguistic corpora.

3.3 Distribution of Syntactic Constructions and Semantic Relations
A. Cross-linguistic distribution and mapping of nominal phrases and compounds
Table 4 shows the distribution of various syntactic constructions used for the
translation of the 6,200 (3,076 N N and 3,124 N P N) Europarl and 2,310 (600 N N
and 1,710 N P N) CLUVI English token instances in each of the five target languages
considered. The data show that N N and N P N constructions cover over 83% of the
translation patterns for both text corpora. However, whereas the distribution of both
constructions is balanced in the Europarl corpus (about 45%, with the exception of
Romanian for which N P N constructions are less frequent), in CLUVI the N P N
constructions occur in more than 85% of the cases (again, with the exception of Ro-
manian where they represent about 56% of the data). The high percentage obtained for
N P N instances in CLUVI is explained by the fact that Romance languages have very
few N N compounds which are of limited semantic types, such as TYPE. Moreover, it
is interesting to note here that some of the English instances are translated into both
noun?noun (N N) and noun?adjective (N A) compounds in the target languages. For
example, love affair translates into either the N A construction enredo amoroso (Spanish),
aventure amoureuse (French), relazione amorosa (Italian), relac?ao amorosa (Portuguese),
and aventura? amoroasa? (Romanian), or using the more common N de N pattern aventura
de amor (Spanish), aventure d?amour (French), storia d?amore (Italian), estoria de amor
(Portuguese), and aventura? de dragoste (Romanian). There are also instances which
translate as one word in the target language, shown in Table 4, column 6. For example,

ankle boot is translated into bottine in French and stivaletto in Italian. The rest of the data
is encoded by other syntactic paraphrases, as shown in Table 4, column 7. For example,

the bomb has exploded?). Moreover, Table 5 shows the distribution of the prepositions

For the purposes of this research, from the 6,200 Europarl and 2,310 CLUVI
instances, we selected those which had all the translations encoded only by N N and
N P N constructions. Columns 3 and 4 in Table 4 show the number of N N and N P N
translation instances in each Romance language. Out of these, we considered only
3,124 Europarl and 2,023 CLUVI token instances representing the examples encoded
by N N and N P N in all languages considered, after inter-annotator agreement.
B. Cross-linguistic distribution of semantic relations and their mapping to nominal
phrases and compounds
A closer look at the N N and N P N translation instances in Table 4 shows that
their syntactic distribution is influenced by the text genre and the semantics of the
instances. For example, in Europarl most of the N N instances were naming noun?
noun compounds referring to entities such as member states and framework law which
were repeated in many sentences. Many of them encoded TYPE relations (e.g., member
state, framework law) which, most of the time, are encoded by N N patterns in the target
languages (stato membro and legge quadro in Italian, respectively). In the CLUVI corpus,
on the other hand, the N N Romance translations represented only 1% of the data. A
notable exception here is Romanian (64.68% of Europarl and 32.8% of CLUVI). This is
explained by the fact that, in Romanian, many noun phrases are represented as genitive-
marked noun compounds (N1 N2). In Romanian the genitive case is realized either as
a suffix attached to the modifier noun N2 or as one of the genitival articles a/al/ale. If
the modifier noun N2 is determined by an indefinite article then the genitive mark is
applied to the article, not to the noun, for example o fata? ? unei fete (?a girl ? of/to a
girl?) and un ba?iat ? unui ba?iat (?a boy ? of/to a boy?). Similarly, if the modifier noun is
determined by the definite article (which is enclitic in Romanian), the genitive mark is
added at the end of the noun together with the article. For example, fata?fetei (the girl ?
girl-GEN), cartea?ca?rt?ii (the book ? book-GEN). Thus, the noun phrase the beauty of the
girl, for instance, is translated as frumuset?ea fetei (?beauty-the girl-GEN?), and the beauty of
a girl as frumuset?ea unei fete (?beauty-the of/to a girl?).
In general, in Romanian the choice between the N de N and the genitive-marked
N N constructions depends on the specificity of the instance. Some noun?noun instances
refer to a specific entity (existential interpretation), in which case the construction
preferred is the genitive-marked N N, or they can refer in general to the category of
those entities (generic interpretation),11 thus using N de N. For example, the instance
the bite of the scorpion (AGENT) translates into mus?ca?tura scorpionului (?bite-the scorpion-
GEN?), whereas a scorpion bite (AGENT) translates into mus?ca?tura? de scorpion (?bite of
scorpion?).
Many semantic relations that allow both the generic and the existential interpre-
tations can be encoded by both N P N and genitive-marked N N constructions as
shown by the example above. However, there are situations when the generic and
the existential interpretations change the meaning of the noun?noun pair. One such
example is the suit of the sailor (POSSESSION) translated as costumul marinarului (?suit-
the sailor-GEN?), and sailor suit (PURPOSE) translated as costum de marinar (?suit of
sailor?).
11 The words existential and generic are borrowed here from the vast linguistic literature on definite and
indefinite descriptions. Here, nouns such as firemen can have different readings in various contexts:
Firemen are available (existential reading), vs. Firemen are altruistic (generic reading).
200
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
At the other extreme there are relations which prefer either the generic or the
existential interpretation. For example, some POSSESSION-encoding instances such as
the budget of the University translate as ?bugetul Universita?t?ii? (budget-the University-GEN)
and not as ?bugetul de Universitate? (budget-the of University). Other relations such as
PURPOSE and SOURCE identify generic instances. For example, (a) olive oil (SOURCE)
translates as ?ulei de ma?sline? (oil of olive), and not as ?uleiul ma?slinei? (oil-the olive-
GEN), and (b) the milk glass (PURPOSE) translates as ?paharul de lapte? (glass-the of milk)
and not as ?paharul laptelui? (glass-the milk-GEN). Other examples include CAUSE and
TOPIC. This observation is very valuable for the interpretation of nominal phrases and
compounds and is used in the learning model to discriminate among the possible
interpretations.
Tables 6 and 7 show the semantic distribution of the instances on both text corpora.
This distribution is represented both in number of tokens (the total number of instances
per relation) and types (the unique number of instances per relation). In Europarl,
the most frequently occurring relations are TYPE and THEME that together represent
about 50% of the data with an equal distribution. The next most frequent relations
are TOPIC, PURPOSE, AGENT, and PROPERTY with an average coverage of about 8%.
Moreover, eight relations of the 22-SR set (KINSHIP, DEPICTION, CAUSE, INSTRUMENT,
SOURCE, MANNER, MEASURE, and BENEFICIARY) did not occur in this corpus. The
9.61% of the OTHER-SR relation represents the ratio of those instances that did not
encode any of the 22 semantic relations. It is interesting to note here the large difference
between the number of types versus tokens for the TYPE relation in Europarl. This is
accounted for by various N N instances such as member states that repeat across the
corpus.
This semantic distribution contrasts with the one in CLUVI. Here, the most fre-
quent relation by far is PART?WHOLE (40.53%), followed by LOCATION (8.95%), AGENT
(6.23%), and IS-A (5.93%). The missing relations are KINSHIP, MANNER and BENEFI-
CIARY. A larger percentage of OTHER-SR instances (12.95%) did not encode any of the
22 semantic relations. Moreover, in CLUVI 256 instances were tagged with more than
one semantic relation with the following distribution: 46.8% MEASURE/PART?WHOLE
(e.g., a couple of cigarettes), 28.2% PART?WHOLE/LOCATION (e.g., bottom of the sea), 10.9%
MEASURE/LOCATION (e.g., cup of chocolate), 8.2% PURPOSE/LOCATION (e.g., waste gar-
den), and 5.9% THEME/MAKE-PRODUCE (e.g., makers of songs). In Europarl, on the other
hand, there were only 97 such cases: 81.4% THEME/MAKE-PRODUCE (e.g., bus manufac-
turers) and 18.6% MEASURE/PART?WHOLE (e.g., number of states).
One way to study the contribution of both the English and Romance prepositions
to the interpretation task is to look at their distribution over the set of semantic relations
on two reasonably large text corpora of different genres. Of course, this approach does
not provide an analysis that generates an exhaustive generalization over the properties
of the language. However, as Tables 6 and 7 show, there are dependencies between the
structure of the Romance language translations and the semantic relations encoded by
the nominal phrases and compounds, although the most frequently occurring preposi-
tions are de and its English equivalent of. Here we use the preposition de to represent a
set of translation equivalents in Romance languages (e.g., the Italian counterpart is di).
These prepositions are semantically underspecified, encoding a large set of semantic
relations. The many-to-many mappings of the prepositions to the semantic classes
adds to the complexity of the interpretation task. For example, in the Europarl corpus
LOCATION is encoded in French by de, sur, devant, and a` pre`s de, while TOPIC is encoded
in English by of, for, on, about and noun compounds, and in Spanish by de, sobre, en
materia de.

Moreover, in the Europarl corpus, 31.64% of the instances are synthetic phrases en-
coding AGENT, MEANS, LOCATION, THEME, and EXPERIENCER. Out of these instances,
98.7% use the preposition of and its Romance equivalent de. In the CLUVI corpus,
14.1% of the examples were verbal, from which the preposition of/de has a coverage
of 77.66%.
Based on the literature on prepositions (Lyons 1986; Barker 1998; Ionin,
Matushansky, and Ruys 2006) and our own observations, the preposition of/de in both
root and synthetic nominal phrases may have a functional or a semantic role, acting
as a linking device with no apparent semantic content, or with a meaning of its own.
Thus, for the interpretation of these constructions a system must rely on the meaning of
preposition and the meaning of the two constituent nouns in particular, and on context

in general. Because the two corpora used in this paper contain both root and synthetic
instances, we employed two semantic resources for this task: WordNet noun semantic
classes and a collection of verb classes in English that correspond to special types of
nominalizations. These resources are defined in Section 4.2. Moreover, in Section 6
we present a detailed linguistic analysis of the prepositions of in English and de in
Romance languages, and show how their selection correlates with the meaning of the
construction.

4. Model
4.1 Mathematical Formulation
Given the syntactic constructions considered, the goal is to develop a procedure for
the automatic annotation of the semantic relations they encode. The semantic relations
derive from various lexical and semantic features of each instance.
The semantic classification of instances of nominal phrases and compounds can be
formulated as a learning problem, and thus benefits from the theoretical foundation
and experience gained with various learning paradigms. The task is a multi-class clas-
sification problem since the output can be one of the semantic relations in the set. We
cast this as a supervised learning problem where input/output pairs are available as
training data.
An important first step is to map the characteristics of each instance (i.e., list of
properties that describe the instance, usually not numerical) into feature vectors. Let us
define xi as the feature vector of an instance i and let X be the space of all instances; that
is, xi ? X.
The multi-class classification is performed by a function that maps the feature space
X into a semantic space S, f :X ? S, where S is the set of semantic relations from Table 1,
namely, rj ? S, where rj is a semantic relation.
Let T be the training set of examples or instances T = (x1r1 .. xlrl) ? (X x S)l where
l is the number of examples x each accompanied by its semantic relation label r. The
problem is to decide which semantic relation to assign to a new, unseen example xl+1.
In order to classify a given set of examples (members of X), one needs some kind of
measure of the similarity (or the difference) between any two given members of X.
Thus, the system receives as input an English nominal phrase and compound
instances along with their translations in the Romance languages, plus a set of extra-
linguistic features. The output is a set of learning rules that classify the data based on
the set of 22 semantic target categories. The learning procedure is supervised and takes
into consideration the cross-linguistic lexico-syntactic information gathered for each
instance.
4.2 Feature Space
The set of features allows a supervised machine learning algorithm to induce a function
that can be applied to accurately classify unseen instances. Based on the study of the
instances and their semantic distribution presented in Section 3, we have identified and
experimented with the following features presented subsequently for each language in-
volved. Features F1?F5 have been employed by us in our previous research (Moldovan
et al 2004; Girju et al 2005; Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan 2006). All the other features
are novel.
A. English features
F1 and F2. Semantic class of noun specifies the WordNet sense of the head noun (F1), and
the modifier noun (F2) and implicitly points to all its hypernyms. The semantics of the
instances of nominal phrases and compounds is heavily influenced by the meaning of
the noun constituents. One such example is family#2 car#1, which encodes a POSSESSION
relation. The hypernyms of the head noun car#1 are: {motor vehicle}, {self-propelled
204
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
vehicle} ... {entity} (cf. WordNet 2.1). These features will help generalize over the se-
mantic classes of the two nouns in the instance corpus.
F3 and F4. WordNet derivationally related form specifies if the head noun (F3), and the
modifier noun (F4) are related to a corresponding verb in WordNet. WordNet contains
information about nouns derived from verbs (e.g., statement derived from to state; cry
from to cry; death from to die).
F5. Prepositional cues link the two nouns in a nominal phrase. These can be either simple
or complex prepositions such as of or according to. In case of N N instances (e.g., member
state), this feature is ???.
F6 and F7. Type of nominalized noun indicates the specific class of nouns the head (F6) or
modifier (F7) belongs to depending on the verb from which it derives. First, we check if
the noun is a nominalization or not. For English we used the NomLex-Plus dictionary of
nominalizations (Meyers at al. 2004) to map nouns to corresponding verbs.12 One such
example is the destruction of the city, where destruction is a nominalization. F6 and F7 may
overlap with features F3 and F4 which are used in case the noun to be checked has no
entry in the NomLex-Plus dictionary.
These features are of particular importance because they impose some constraints
on the possible set of relations the instance can encode. They take the following values:
a) active form nouns, b) unaccusative nouns, c) unergative nouns, and d) inherently
passive nouns. We present them in more detail subsequently.
a. Active form nouns are derived through nominalization from psych verbs and rep-
resent states of emotion, such as love, fear, desire, and so forth. They have an intrinsic
active voice predicate?argument structure and, thus, resist passivisation. For example,
we can say the desire of Anna, but not the desire by Anna. This is also explained by
the fact that in English the AGENT or EXPERIENCER relations are mostly expressed
by the clitic genitive ?s (e.g., Anna?s desire) and less or never by N P N constructions.
Citing Anderson (1983), Giorgi and Longobardi (1991) mention that with such nouns
that resist passivisation, the preposition introducing the internal argument, even if
it is of, has always a semantic content, and is not a bare case-marker realizing the
genitive case. Moreover, they argue that the meaning of these nouns might pattern
differently in different languages. Consider for example the Italian sentences (4) and (5)
below and their English equivalents (see Giorgi and Longobardi 1991, pages 121?
122). In English the instance Anna?s desire identifies the subject of desire (and thus
encodes an EXPERIENCER relation), whereas in Italian it can identify either the subject
(EXPERIENCER) as in Example (4), or the object of desire (THEME) as in Example (5),
the disambiguation being done at the discourse level. In Example (6) the prenominal
construction il suo desiderio encodes only EXPERIENCER.
(4) Il desiderio di Anna fu esaudito. (EXPERIENCER)
(The desire of Anna was fulfilled.)
?Anna?s desire was fulfilled.?
(5) Il desiderio di Anna lo portera` alla rovina. (THEME)
(The desire of Anna him will ruin.)
?The desire for Anna will ruin him.?
12 NomLex-Plus is a hand-coded database of 5,000 verb nominalizations, de-adjectival, and de-adverbial
nouns including the corresponding subcategorization frames (verb-argument structure information).
205
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
(6) Il suo desiderio fu esaudito. (EXPERIENCER)
(The her desire was fulfilled.)
?Her desire was fulfilled.?
However, our observations on the Romanian training instances in Europarl and CLUVI
(captured by features F12 and F13 below) indicate that the choice of syntactic construc-
tions can help in the disambiguation of instances that include such active nouns. Thus,
whereas genitive-marked N N compounds identify only the subject (thus encoding
EXPERIENCER), the N de/pentru N constructions identify only the object (thus encoding
THEME). Such examples are dorint?a Anei (?desire-the Anna-GEN? ? Anna?s desire) (EX-
PERIENCER) and dorint?a de/pentru Ana (?desire-the of/for Anna? ? the desire for Anna)
(THEME).
Another example is the love of children and not the love by the children, where children
are the recipients of love, not its experiencers. In Italian the instance translates as l?amore
per i bambini (?the love for the children?), whereas in Romanian it translates as dragostea
pentru copii (?love-the for children?). These nouns mark their internal argument through
of in English and most of the time require prepositions such as for in Romance languages
and vice versa.
b. Unaccusative nouns are derived from ergative verbs that take only internal ar-
guments (e.g., those that indicate an object and not a subject grammatical role). For
example, the transitive verb to disband allows the subject to be deleted as in the following
sentences:
(7) The lead singer disbanded the group in 1991.
(8) The group disbanded.
Thus, the corresponding unaccusative nominalization of to disband, the disbandment of
the group, encodes THEME and not AGENT.
c. Unergative nouns are derived from intransitive verbs. They can take only AGENT
semantic relations. One such case is exemplified in the instance l?arrivo della cavalleria in
Italian which translates in English as the arrival of the cavalry and in Romanian as sorirea
cavaleriei (?arrival-the cavalry-GEN?).
d. Inherently passive nouns. These nouns, like the verbs they are derived from, assume
an implicit AGENT relation and, being transitive, associate to their internal argument
the THEME relation. One such example is the capture of the soldier which translates in
Italian as la cattura del soldato (?the capture of the soldier?), la capture du soldat in French
(?the capture of soldier?), and la captura de soldado in Spanish and Portuguese (?the
capture of soldier?), where the nominalization capture (cattura, capture, captura in Italian,
French, and Spanish and Portuguese respectively) is derived from the verb to capture.
Here, whereas English and Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French use the N of/de N
construction (as shown in Examples (9) and (10) for English and Italian), Romanian
uses genitive-marked noun compounds. In Romanian, however, nominalizations are
formed through suffixation, where a suffix is added to the root of the verb it comes from.
Different suffixes attached to the same verb may lead, however, to more than one nom-
inalization, producing different meanings. The verb to capture (a captura in Romanian),
for example, can result through suffixation in two nominalizations: capturare (with the
206
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
infinitive suffix -are and encoding an implicit AGENT relation) and captura? (through
zero derivation and encoding an implicit THEME relation) (Cornilescu 2001). Thus, the
noun phrase capturarea soldatului (?capture-the soldier-GEN?) encodes a THEME relation,
while captura soldatului (?capture-the soldier-GEN?) encodes an AGENT relation. In all the
Romance languages with the exception of Romanian, this construction is ambiguous,
unless the AGENT is explicitly stated or inferred as shown in Example (9) for Italian.
The same ambiguity might occur sometimes in English, with the difference that besides
the of-genitive, English also uses the s-genitive: the soldier?s capture (AGENT is preferred
if the context doesn?t mention otherwise), the soldier?s capture by the enemy (THEME), the
capture of the soldier (THEME is preferred if the context doesn?t mention otherwise), the
capture of the soldier by the enemy (THEME).
(9) La cattura del soldato (da parte del nemigo) e` cominciata come un atto terroristico.
(THEME)
?The capture of the soldier (by the enemy) has started as a terrorist act.?
(10) La sua cattura e` cominciata come un atto terroristico. (THEME)
?His capture has started as a terrorist act.?
These nouns have a different behavior than that of active form nouns. As shown
previously, the object of inherently passive nouns can move to the subject position as
in the soldier?s capture by the enemy, whereas it cannot do so for active form nouns (e.g.,
*Anna?s desire by John). Similarly, in Italian, although active form nouns allow only the
subject reading in prenominal constructions (e.g., il suo desiderio ? ?her desire?), inher-
ently passive nouns allow only the object reading (e.g., la sua cattura ? ?his capture?).
For Romanian, the nominalization suffixes were identified based on the morpho-
logical patterns presented in Cornilescu (2001).
We assembled a list of about 3,000 nouns that belong to classes a?d using the infor-
mation on subcategorization frames and thematic roles of the verbs in VerbNet (Kipper,
Dang, and Palmer 2000). VerbNet is a database which encodes rich lexical information
for a large number of English verbs in the form of subcategorization information,
selectional restrictions, thematic roles for each argument of the verb, and alternations
(the syntactic constructions in which the verb participates).
B. Romance features
F8, F9, F10, F11, and F12. Prepositional cues that link the two nouns are extracted from
each translation of the English instance: F8 (Sp.), F9 (Fr.), F10 (It.), F11 (Port.), and F12
(Ro.). These can be either simple or complex prepositions (e.g., de, in materia de [Sp.]) in
all five Romance languages, or the Romanian genitival article a/al/ale. For N N instances,
this feature is ???.
F13.Noun inflection is defined only for Romanian and shows if the modifier noun in N N
instances is not inflected or is inflected and modifies the head noun which is or is not
a nominalization. This feature is used to help differentiate between instances encoded
by genitive-marked N N constructions and noun?noun compounds, when the choice
of syntactic construction reflects different semantic content. Two such examples are the
noun?noun compound lege cadru (law framework) (TYPE) which translates as framework
207
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
law and the genitive-marked N N instance frumuset?ea fetei (?beauty-the girl-GEN?) (PROP-
ERTY) meaning the beauty of the girl. It also covers examples such as capturarea soldatului
(?capture-the soldier-GEN?), where the modifier soldatului is inflected and the head noun
capturarea is a nominalization derived through infinitive suffixation.
In the following Example we present the feature vector for the instance the capture
of the soldiers.
(11) The instance the capture of the soldiers has the following Romance translations:
?capture#4/Arg2 of soldiers#1/Arg1; captura de soldados; capture du soldats; cattura dei soldati;
captura dos soldados; capturarea soldat?ilor; THEME?.
Its corresponding feature vector is:
?entity#1/Arg2; entity#1/Arg1; capture; ?; of; inherently passive noun; ?; de; de; de; de; ?;
mod-inflected-inf-nom; THEME?,
where mod-inflected-inf-nom indicates that the noun modifier soldat?ilor in the Ro-
manian translation capturarea soldat?ilor (?capture-the soldiers-GEN?) is inflected and that
the head noun capturarea is an infinitive nominalization.
4.3 Learning Models
Several learning models can be used to provide the discriminating function f. We
have experimented with the support vector machines model and compared the results
against two state-of-the-art models: semantic scattering, a supervised model described
in Moldovan et al (2004), Girju et al (2005), and Moldovan and Badulescu (2005), and
Lapata and Keller?s Web-based unsupervised model (Lapata and Keller 2005).
Each model was trained and tested on the Europarl and CLUVI corpora using a
7:3 training?testing ratio. All the test nouns were tagged with the corresponding sense
in context using a state-of-the-art WSD tool (Mihalcea and Faruque 2004). The default
semantic argument frame for each relation was used in the automatic identification of
the argument positions.
A. Support vector machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used
for creating a learning function from a set of labeled training instances. The function
can be either a classification function, where the output is binary (is the instance of
category X?), or it can be a general regression function. For classification, SVMs operate
by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs. This hypersurface will attempt
to split the positive examples from the negative examples. The split will be chosen
to have the largest distance from the hypersurface to the nearest of the positive and
negative examples. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that
is similar but not identical to the training data.
In order to achieve classification in n semantic classes, n > 2, we built a binary
classifier for each pair of classes (a total of C2n classifiers), and then we used a voting
procedure to establish the class of a new example. For the experiments with semantic
relations, the simplest voting scheme has been chosen; each binary classifier has one
vote, which is assigned to the class it chooses when it is run. Then the class with the
largest number of votes is considered to be the answer. The software used in these
experiments is the package LIBSVM (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/?cjlin/libsvm/)
which implements an SVM model. We tested with the radial-based kernel.
208
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
After the initial instances in the training and testing corpora were expanded with
the corresponding features, we had to prepare them for the SVM model. The set-up
procedure is now described.
Corpus set-up for the SVM model:
The processing method consists of a set of iterative procedures of specialization of
the examples on the WordNet IS-A hierarchy. Thus, after a set of necessary specializa-
tion iterations, the method produces specialized examples which through supervised
machine learning are transformed into sets of semantic rules for the semantic interpre-
tation of nominal phrases and compounds. The specialization procedure is described
subsequently.
Initially, the training corpus consists of examples that follow the format exemplified
at the end of Section 4.2 (Example [11]). Note that for the English instances, each noun
constituent was expanded with the corresponding WordNet top semantic class. At this
point, the generalized training corpus contains two types of examples: unambiguous
and ambiguous. The second situation occurs when the training corpus classifies the
same noun?noun pair into more than one semantic category. For example, both rela-
tionships chocolate#2 cake#3 (PART?WHOLE) and chocolate#2 article#1 (TOPIC) are mapped
into the more general type ?entity#1, entity#1, PART?WHOLE/TOPIC?.13 We recursively
specialize these examples to eliminate the ambiguity. By specialization, the semantic
class is replaced with the corresponding hyponym for that particular sense, that is,
the concept immediately below in the hierarchy. These steps are repeated until there
are no more ambiguous examples. For this example, the specialization stops at the
first hyponym of entity: physical entity (for cake) and abstract entity (for article). For the
unambiguous examples in the generalized training corpus (those that are classified
with a single semantic relation), constraints are determined using cross-validation on
the SVM model.
B. Semantic scattering
The semantic scattering (SS) model was initially tested on the classification of genitive
constructions, but it is also applicable to nominal phrases and compounds (Moldovan
et al 2004). SS is a supervised model which, like the SVM model described previously,
relies on WordNet?s IS-A semantic hierarchy to learn a function which separates positive
and negative examples. Essentially, it consists of using a training data set to establish a
boundary G? on WordNet noun hierarchies such that each feature pair of noun?noun
senses fij on this boundary maps uniquely into one of a predefined list of semantic
relations. The algorithm starts with the most general boundary corresponding to the
entity WordNet noun hierarchy and then specializes it based on the training data until
a good approximation is reached.14 Any feature pair above the boundary maps into
more than one semantic relation. Due to the specialization property on noun hierarchies,
feature pairs below the boundary also map into only one semantic relation. For any new
pair of noun?noun senses, the model finds the closest boundary pair which maps to one
semantic relation.
The authors define with SCm = { f mi } and SC
h = { f hj } the sets of semantic class features
for modifier noun and, respectively, head noun. A pair of<modifier, head> nouns maps
13 The specialization procedure applies only to features 1 and 2.
14 Moldovan et al (2004) used a list of 35 semantic relations ? actually only 22 of them proved to be encoded
by nominal phrases and compounds.
209
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
uniquely into a semantic class feature pair ? f mi , f
h
j ? (henceforth fij). The probability of a
semantic relation r given the feature pair fij, P(r| fij ) =
n(r,fij )
n( fij )
is defined as the ratio between
the number of occurrences of a relation r in the presence of the feature pair fij over the
number of occurrences of the feature pair fij in the corpus. The most probable semantic
relation r? is
r? = arg max
r?R
P(r| fij) = arg max
r?R
P( fij|r)P(r) (1)
From the training corpus, one can measure the quantities n(r, fij) and n( fij). Depend-
ing on the level of abstraction of fij two cases are possible:
Case 1. The feature pair fij is specific enough such that there is only one semantic
relation r for which P(r| fij) = 1 and 0 for all the other semantic relations.
Case 2. The feature pair fij is general enough such that there are at least two semantic
relations for which P(r| fij) = 0. In this case Equation (1) is used to find the most appro-
priate r?.

Step 1. Create an initial boundary.
The initial boundary denoted G1 is formed from combinations of the entity#1 ?
entity#1 noun class pairs. For each training example a corresponding feature fij is
first determined, after which it is replaced with the most general corresponding
feature consisting of top WordNet hierarchy concepts. For example, both instances
family#2 estate#2 (POSSESSION) and the sister#1 of the boy#1 (KINSHIP) are mapped into
entity#1 ? entity#1. At this level, the noun?noun feature encodes a number of semantic
relations. For each feature, one can determine the most probable relation using Equa-
tion (1). For instance, the feature entity#1 ? entity#1 can be encoded by any of the 23
relations.
The next step is to construct a lower boundary by specializing the semantic classes
of the ambiguous features. A feature fij is ambiguous if it corresponds to more than
one relation and its most relevant relation has a conditional probability less than 0.9.
210
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
To eliminate irrelevant specializations, the algorithm specializes only the ambiguous
classes that occur in more than 1% of the training examples.
The specialization procedure consists of first identifying the features fij to which
correspond more than one semantic relation, then replacing these features with their
hyponym synsets. Thus one feature breaks into several new specialized features.
For example, the feature entity#1 ? entity#1 generated through generalization for
the examples family#2 estate#2 and the sister#1 of the boy#1 is specialized now as
kin group#1 ? real property#1 and female sibling#1 ? male person#1 corresponding to the
direct hyponyms of the nouns in these instances. The net effect is that the semantic
relations that were attached to fij will be ?scattered? across the new specialized features
which form the second boundary. The probability of the semantic relations that are
encoded by these specialized features is recalculated again using Equation (1). The
number of relations encoded by each of this boundary?s features is less than the one for
the features defining the previous boundary. This process continues until each feature
has only one semantic relation attached. Each iteration creates a new boundary.
Step 2. Test the new boundary.
The new boundary is more specific than the previous boundary and it is closer to the
ideal boundary. One does not know how well it behaves on unseen examples, but the
goal is to find a boundary that classifies these instances with high accuracy. Thus,
the boundary is first tested on only 10% of the annotated examples (different from
the 10% of the examples used for testing). If the accuracy is larger than the previous
boundary?s accuracy, the algorithm is converging toward the best approximation of the
boundary and thus it repeats Step 2 for the new boundary. If the accuracy is lower than
the previous boundary?s accuracy, the new boundary is too specific and the previous
boundary is a better approximation of the ideal boundary.
C. Lapata and Keller?s Web-based unsupervised model
Lauer (1995) was the first to devise and test an unsupervised probabilistic model for
noun?noun compound interpretation on Grolier?s Encyclopedia, an eight million word
corpus, based on a set of eight preposition paraphrases. His probabilistic model com-
putes the probability of a preposition p given a noun?noun pair n1 ? n2 and finds
the most likely preposition paraphrase p? = argmaxpP(p|n1,n2). However, as Lauer
noticed, this model requires a very large training corpus to estimate these proba-
bilities. More recently, Lapata and Keller (2005) replicated the model using the Web
as training corpus and showed that the best performance was obtained with the trigram
model f (n1, p,n2). In their approach, they used as the count for a given trigram the num-
ber of pages returned by using the trigram as a query. These co-occurrence frequencies
were estimated using inflected queries which are obtained by expanding a noun?noun
compound into all its morphological forms; then searching for N P N instances, for each
of the eight prepositions P in Lauer?s list. All queries are performed as exact matches
using quotation marks. For example, for the test noun?noun compound instancewar sto-
ries, all possible combinations of definite/indefinite articles and singular/plural noun
forms are tried resulting in the queries story about war, a/the story about war, story about
a/the war, stories about war, stories about the wars, story about wars, story about the wars,
and so on. These forms are then submitted as literal queries, and the resulting hits are
summed up. The query, and thus the preposition, with the largest number of hits is
selected as the correct semantic interpretation category.
211
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
For the Europarl and CLUVI test sets, we replicated Lapata and Keller?s (2005) ex-
periments using Google.15 We formed inflected queries with the patterns they proposed
and searched the Web.
5. Experimental Results
We performed various experiments on both the Europarl and CLUVI testing corpora
using seven sets of supervised models. Table 8 shows the results obtained against SS
and Lapata and Keller?s model on both corpora and the contribution of the features
exemplified in seven versions of the SVM model. Supervised models 1 and 2 are defined
only for the English features. Here, features F1 and F2 measure the contribution of the
WordNet IS-A lexical hierarchy specialization. However, supervised model 1, which is
also the baseline, does not differentiate between unambiguous and ambiguous training
examples and thus does not specialize those that are ambiguous. These models show
the difference between SS and SVM and the contribution of the other English features,
such as preposition and nominalization (F1?F7).
The table shows that overall the performance is better for the Europarl corpus
than for CLUVI. For the supervised models 1 and 2, SS [F1 + F2] gives better re-
sults than SVM [F1 + F2]. The inclusion of the other English features (SVM [F1?F7])
adds more than 10% accuracy (with a higher increase in Europarl) for the supervised
model 1.
The results obtained are presented using the standard measure of accuracy (the
number of correctly labeled instances over the number of instances in the test set).
5.1 The Contribution of Romance Linguistic Features
Our intuition is that the more information we use from other languages for the interpre-
tation of an English instance, the better the results. Thus, we wanted to see the impact
of each Romance language on the overall performance. Supervised model 3 shows the
results obtained for English and the Romance language that contributed the least to the
performance (English and Spanish for the entire English feature subset F1?F8). Here we
computed the performance on all five English?Romance language combinations and
chose the Romance language that provided the best result. Thus, supervised models 3
through 7 add Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian in this order and
show the contribution of each Romance preposition and all English features.
The language ranking in Table 8 shows that Romance languages considered here
have a different contribution to the overall performance. Whereas the addition of
Portuguese in CLUVI decreases the performance, in Europarl it increases it, if only
by a few points. However, a closer analysis of the data shows that this is mostly due
to the distribution of the corpus instances. For example, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese are consistent in the choice of preposition (e.g., if the preposition de [of ] is
used in French, then the corresponding preposition is used in the other four language
translations). A notable exception here is Romanian which provides two possible con-
structions with almost equal distribution: the N P N and the genitive-marked N N. The
table shows (in the increase in performance between supervised models 6 and 7) that
15 As Google limits the number of queries to 1,000 per day per computer, we repeated the experiment using
10 computers for a number of days. Although Keller and Lapata used AltaVista for the interpretation of
two noun?noun compounds, they showed that there is almost no difference between the correlations
achieved using Google and AltaVista counts.

this choice is not random, but influenced by the meaning of the instances (features F12,
F13). This observation is also supported by the contribution of each feature to the overall
performance. For example, in Europarl, the WordNet verb and nominalization features
of the head noun (F3, F6) have a contribution of 5.12%, whereas for the modifier nouns
they decrease by about 2.7%. The English preposition (F5) contributes 6.11% (Europarl)
and 4.82% (CLUVI) to the overall performance.
The most frequently occurring preposition in both corpora is the underspecified
preposition de (of ), encoding almost all of the 22 semantic relations. The many-to-
many mappings of the preposition to the semantic classes adds to the complexity
of the interpretation task. A closer look at the Europarl and CLUVI data shows that
Lauer?s set of eight prepositions represents 88.2% (Europarl) and 91.8% (CLUVI) of the
N P N instances. From these, the most frequent preposition is of with a coverage of 79%
(Europarl) and 88% (CLUVI). Because the polysemy of this preposition is very high, we
wanted to analyze its behavior on the set of most representative semantic relations in
both corpora. Moreover, we wanted to see what prepositions were used to translate the
English nominal phrase and compound instances in the target Romance languages, and
thus to capture the semantic (ir)regularities among these languages in the two corpora
and their contribution to the semantic interpretation task.
For most of the N P N instances, we noticed consistent behavior of the target
Romance languages in terms of the prepositions used. This behavior can be classified
213

roughly in four categories exemplified subsequently: Example (12) shows a combination
of the preposition of/de and more specific prepositions; Example (13) shows different
prepositions than the one corresponding to the English equivalent in the instance; and
Examples (14) and (15) show corresponding translations of the equivalent preposi-
tion in English in all Romance languages with variations in Romanian (e.g., de for of,
para/pour/par/pentru for for).

Because the last three categories are the most frequent in both corpora, we analyzed
their instances. Most of the time Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese make use of
specific prepositions such as those in Examples (12) and (13) to encode some semantic
relations such as PURPOSE and LOCATION, but rely on N de N constructions for almost
all the other relations. English and Romanian, however, can choose between N N and
N P N constructions. In the next section we present in more detail an analysis of the
semantic correlations between English and Romanian nominal phrases and compounds
and their role in the semantic interpretation task.
6. Linguistic Observations
In this section we present some linguistic observations derived from the analysis of
the system?s performance on the CLUVI and Europarl corpora. More specifically, we
present different types of ambiguity that can occur in the interpretation of nominal
phrases and compounds when using more abstract interpretation categories such as
Lauer?s eight prepositions. We also show that the choice of syntactic constructions
in English and Romanian can help in the identification of the correct position of the
semantic arguments in test instances.
6.1 Observations on Lapata and Keller?s Unsupervised Model
In this section we show some of the limitations of the unsupervised probabilistic ap-
proaches that rely on more abstract interpretation categories, such as Lauer?s set of
eight prepositions. For this, we used Lapata and Keller?s approach, a state-of-the-art
knowledge-poor Web-based unsupervised probabilistic model which provided a per-
formance of 42.12% on Europarl and 41.10% on CLUVI. We manually checked the first

five entries of the pages returned by Google for each most frequent N P N paraphrase
for 100 CLUVI and Europarl instances and noticed that about 35% of them were wrong
due to syntactic (e.g., part of speech) and/or semantic ambiguities. For example, baby cry
generated instances such as ?it will make moms cry with the baby,? where cry is a verb,
not a noun. This shows that many of the NP instances selected by Google as matching
the N P N query are incorrect, and thus the number of hits returned for the query is over-
estimated. Thus, because we wanted to measure the impact of various types of noun?
noun compound ambiguities on the interpretation performance, we further tested the
probabilistic Web-based model on four distinct test sets selected from Europarl, each
containing 30 noun?noun compounds encoding different types of ambiguity: In Set#1
the noun constituents had only one part of speech and one WordNet sense; in Set#2 the
nouns had at least two possible parts of speech and were semantically unambiguous; in
Set#3 the nouns were ambiguous only semantically; and in Set#4 they were ambiguous
both syntactically and semantically. Table 9 shows that for Set#1, the model obtained an
accuracy of 35.28%, while for more semantically ambiguous compounds it obtained an
average accuracy of about 48% (50.63% [Set#3] and 43.25% [Set#4]. This shows that for
more syntactically ambiguous instances, the Web-based probabilistic model introduces
a significant number of false positives, thus decreasing the accuracy (cf. sets #1 vs. #2
and #3 vs. #4).
Moreover, further analyses of the results obtained with Lapata and Keller?s model
showed that about 30% of the noun?noun compounds in sets #3 and #4 were ambiguous
with at least two possible readings. For example, paper bag can be interpreted out-
of-context both as bag of paper (bag made of paper?STUFF?OBJECT, a subtype of
PART?WHOLE) and as bag for papers (bag used for storing papers?PURPOSE). Simi-
larly, gingerbread bowl can be correctly paraphrased both as bowl of/with gingerbread
(CONTENT?CONTAINER) and as bowl of gingerbread (bowl made of gingerbread?STUFF?
OBJECT). The following two examples show the two readings of the noun?noun com-
pound gingerbread bowl as found on Google:
(16) Stir a bowl of gingerbread,
Smooth and spicy and brown,
Roll it with a rolling pin,
Up and up and down,
...16
16 An excerpt from the ?Gingerbread Man? song.

Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
(17) The gingerbread will take the shape of the glass bowl. Let it cool for a few
minutes and then carefully loosen the foil and remove the gingerbread from
the glass. And voila`: your bowl of gingerbread.
These ambiguities partially explain why the accuracy values obtained for sets #3
and #4 are higher then the ones obtained for the other two sets. The semantic ambiguity
also explains why the accuracy obtained for set #2 is higher than that for set #4. For these
sets of examples the syntactic ambiguity affected the accuracy much less than the se-
mantic ambiguity (that is, more N P N combinations were possible due to various noun
senses). This shows one more time that a large number of noun?noun compounds are
covered by more abstract categories, such as prepositions. Moreover, these categories
also allow for a large variation as to which category a compound should be assigned.
6.2 Observations on the Symmetry of Semantic Relations: A Study on English
and Romanian
Nominal phrases and compounds in English, nominal phrases in the Romance lan-
guages considered here, and genitive-marked noun?noun compounds in Romanian
have an inherent directionality imposed by their fixed syntactic structure. For example,
in English noun?noun compounds the syntactic head always follows the syntactic
modifier, whereas in English and Romance nominal phrases the order is reversed. Two
such examples are tea/Modifier cup/Head and glass/Head of wine/Modifier.
The directionality of semantic relations (i.e., the order of the semantic arguments)
however, is not fixed and thus it is not always the same as the inherent direc-
tionality imposed by the syntactic structure. Two such examples are ham/Modifier/
Arg2 sandwich/Head/Arg1 and spoon/Modifier/Arg1 handle/Head/Arg2. Although
both instances encode a PART?WHOLE relation (Arg1 is the semantic argument iden-
tifying the whole and Arg2 is the semantic argument identifying the part), their se-
mantic arguments are not listed in the same order (Arg1 Arg2 for spoon handle and
Arg2 Arg1 for ham sandwich). For a better understanding of this phenomenon, we
performed a more thorough analysis of the training instances in both CLUVI and
Europarl. Because the choice of syntactic constructions in context is governed in part
by semantic factors, we focused on English and Romanian because they are the only
languages from the set considered here with two productive syntactic options: N N
and N P N (English) and genitive-marked N N and N P N (Romanian). Thus, we
grouped the English?Romanian parallel instances per each semantic relation and each
syntactic construction and checked if the relation was symmetric or not, according to
the following definition.
Definition
We say that a semantic relation is symmetric relative to a particular syntactic
construction if there is at least one relation instance whose arguments are in a different
order than the order indicated by the relation?s default argument frame for that
construction.
For example, PART?WHOLE is symmetric with regard to nominal phrases because
the semantic arguments of the instance the building/Arg1 with parapets/Arg2 are in a
different order than the one imposed by the relation?s default argument frame (Arg2
P Arg1) for nominal phrases (cf. Table 1).
216
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
Because the relation distribution is skewed in both corpora, we focused only on
those relations encoded by at least 50 instances in both Europarl and CLUVI. For
example, in English the POSSESSION relation is symmetric when encoded by N P N and
noun?noun compounds. For instance, we can say the girl with three dogs and the resources
of the Union, but also family estate and land proprietor. The findings are summarized and
presented in Table 10 along with examples. Some relations such as IS-A, PURPOSE, and
MEASURE cannot be encoded by genitive-marked noun?noun compounds in Romanian
(indicated by ??? in the table). A checkmark symbol indicates if the relation is symmetric
(??) or not (?x?) for a particular syntactic construction. It is interesting to note that not
all the relations are symmetric and this behavior varies from one syntactic construction
to another and from one language to another. Although some relations such as AGENT
and THEME are not symmetric, others such as TEMPORAL, PART?WHOLE, and LOCATION
are symmetric irrespective of the syntactic construction used.
Symmetric relations pose important challenges to the automatic interpretation of
nominal phrases and compounds because the system has to know which of the nouns
is the semantic modifier and which is the semantic head. In this research, the order
of the semantic arguments has been manually identified and marked in the training
corpora. However, this information is not provided for unseen test instances. So far,
in our experiments with the test data the system used the order indicated by the
default argument frames. Another solution is to build argument frames for clusters of
prepositions which impose a particular order of the arguments in N P N constructions.
For example, in the N2 P N1 phrases the books on the table (LOCATION) and relaxation
during the summer (TEMPORAL), the semantic content of the prepositions on and during
identifies the position of the physical and temporal location (e.g., that N1 is the time
or location). This approach works most of the time for relations such as LOCATION
and TEMPORAL because in both English and Romance languages they rely mostly on
prepositions indicating location and time and less on underspecified prepositions such
as of or de. However, a closer look at these relations shows that some of the noun?noun
pairs that encode them are not symmetric and this is true for both English and Romance.
For instance, cut on the chin and house in the city cannot be reversed as chin P cut or
city P house. One notable exception here is indicated by examples such as box of/with
matches ? matches in/inside the box and vessels of/with blood ? blood in vessels17 encoding
CONTENT?CONTAINER. Another special case is when P1 and P2 are location antonyms
(e.g., the book under the folder and the folder on the book). However, even here symmetry
is not always possible, being influenced by pragmatic factors (Herskovits 1987) (e.g.,
we can say the vase on the table, but not the table under the vase?this has to do with the
difference in size of the objects indicated by the head and modifier nouns. Thus, a larger
object cannot be said to be placed under a smaller one).
It is important to stress here the fact that our definition of symmetry of semantic
relations does not focus in particular on the symmetry of an instance noun?noun pair
that encodes the relation, although it doesn?t exclude such a case. We call this lexical
symmetry and define it here.
Definition
We say that a noun?noun pair (N1 ? N2) is symmetric relative to a particular syntactic
construction and the semantic relation it encodes in that construction if the order of the
nouns in the construction can be changed provided the semantic relation is preserved.
17 Here the noun vessels refers to a type of container.

Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
For instance, the pair building?parapets in the nominal phrases the building/Arg1 with
parapets/Arg2 and the parapets/Arg2 of the building/Arg1 encodes a PART?WHOLE relation.
Here, both the noun?noun pair and the semantic relation are symmetric relative to
N P N. However, the situation is different for instances such as the book/Arg2 under
the folder/Arg1 and the folder/Arg2 on the book/Arg1, both encoding LOCATION. Here, the
book?folder pair is symmetric in N P N constructions (in the first instance the book is the
syntactic head and the folder is the modifier, whereas in the second instance the order
is reversed). However, the LOCATION relation they encode is not symmetric (in both
instances, the order of the semantic arguments matches the default argument frame for
LOCATION). It is interesting to notice here that these two location instances are actually
paraphrases of one another. This can be explained by the fact that both the book and the
folder can act as a location with respect to the other, and that the prepositions under and
on are location antonyms. In comparison, the building with parapets is not a paraphrase
of the parapets of the building. Here, the nouns building and parapets cannot act as a
whole/part with respect to each other (e.g., the only possible whole here is the noun
building, and the only possible part here is the noun parapets). This is because parts and
wholes have an inherent semantic directionality imposed by the inclusion operation on
the set of things representing parts and wholes, respectively.
In this research we consider the identification and extraction of semantic relations
in nominal phrases and compounds, but we do not focus in particular on the acquisition
of paraphrases in these constructions. Our goal is to build an accurate semantic parser
which will automatically annotate instances of nominal phrases and compounds with
semantic relations in context. This approach promises to be very useful in applications
that require semantic inference, such as textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan 2005).
However, a thorough analysis of the semantics of nominal phrases and compounds
should focus on both semantic relations and paraphrases. We leave this topic for future
research.
Because we wanted to study in more detail the directionality of semantic relations,
we focused on PART?WHOLE. These relations, and most of the semantic relations con-
sidered here, are encoded mostly by N of/de N constructions, genitive-marked N N
(Romanian), and noun?noun compounds (English) and thus, the task of argument order
identification becomes more challenging. For the purpose of this research we decided
to take a closer look at the PART?WHOLE relation in both CLUVI and Europarl where
together it accounted for 920 token and 636 type instances. We show subsequently a
detailed analysis of the symmetry property on a classification of PART?WHOLE relations
starting with a set of five PART?WHOLE subtypes identified by Winston, Chaffin, and
Hermann (1987):18 (1) Component?Integral object, (2) Member?Collection, (3) Portion?Mass,
(4) Stuff?Object, and (5) Place?Area.
(1) Component?Integral object
This is a relation between components and the objects to which they belong. Integral
objects have a structure with their components being separable and having a functional
relation with their wholes. This type of PART?WHOLE relation can be encoded by N of N
and less often by N N constructions. Moreover, here the existential interpretation is
preferred over the generic one. Such examples are the leg of the table and the table
leg which translate in Romanian as piciorul mesei (?leg-the table-GEN?). In Romanian a
18 Winston, Chaffin, and Hermann (1987) identified six subtypes of PART?WHOLE relations, one of which,
(Feature?Activity), is not presented here because it is not frequently encoded by N N and N P N
constructions.
219
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
generic interpretation is also possible, but with change of construction and most of the
time of semantic relation (e.g., picior de masa? ? ?leg of table? encoding PURPOSE19).
This relation subtype is symmetric in English for both N N and N P N con-
structions. In Romanian, however, it is symmetric only when encoded by N P N.
Moreover, it is interesting to note that Modifier/Arg1 Head/Arg2 noun?noun com-
pound instances translate as genitive noun?noun compounds in Romanian, whereas
Modifier/Arg2 Head/Arg1 instances translate as N P N, with P different from of. For
example, chair/Arg1 arm/Arg2 and ham/Arg2 sandwich/Arg1 translate in Romanian as
Head/Arg2 Modifier/Arg1 ? brat?ul scaunului (?arm-the chair-GEN?) and Head/Arg1 P
Modifier/Arg2 ? sandwich cu s?unca? (?sandwich with ham?).
For N P N instances in Romanian and English both Arg1 P1 Arg2 and Arg2 P2 Arg1
argument orderings are possible, but with a different choice of preposition (with P1
different from of/de). For example, one can say the parapets/Arg2 of the building/Arg1,
but also the building/Arg1 with parapets/Arg2. A closer look at such instances shows that
symmetry is possible when the modifier (in this case the part) is not a mandatory part
of the whole, but an optional part with special features (e.g., color, shape). For example,
the car with the door is less preferred than the car with the red door which differentiates the
car from other types of cars.
(2) Stuff?Object
This category encodes the relations between an object and the material of which it
is partly or entirely made. The parts are not similar to the wholes which they compose,
cannot be separated from the whole, and have no functional role. The relation can
be encoded by both N of N and N N English and Romanian patterns and the choice
between existential and generic interpretations correlates with the relation symmetry.
For N N constructions this relation subtype is not symmetric, while for N P N it
is symmetric only in English. Such examples are brush/Arg2 hut/Arg1 in English, and
metalul/Arg2 scaunului/Arg1 (?metal-the seat-GEN? ? the metal of the seat) and scaun de metal
(?chair of metal? ? metal chair) in Romanian.
N P N instances can only be encoded by of in English or de/din (of/from) in Ro-
manian. If the position of the arguments is Arg1 of Arg2 and Arg2 is an indefinite noun
indicating the part then the instance interpretation is generic. For example, seat of metal
translates as scaun de/din metal (?chair of/from metal?) in Romanian. It is important to
note here the possible choice of the preposition from in Romanian, a preposition which
is rarely used in English for this type of relation.
When the position of the arguments changes (e.g., Arg2 of Arg1), the same preposi-
tion of is used and the semantic relation is still STUFF?OBJECT, but the instance is more
specific having an existential interpretation. For instance, the metal of the seat translates in
Romanian as metalul scaunului (?metal-the seat-GEN?) and not as metalul de scaun (?metal-
the of seat?).
(3) Portion?Mass
According to Selkirk (1982a), Ionin, Matushansky, and Ruys (2006), and our own
observations on the CLUVI and Europarl data, this type of PART?WHOLE relation can
be further classified into mass, measure, and fraction partitives. Here the parts are
separable and similar to each other and to the whole they are part of. An example of a
mass partitive is half/Arg2 of the cake/Arg1 which translates in Romanian as juma?tate/Arg2
19 This reading is possible if the leg is separated from the table.
220
Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
de/din prajitura?/Arg1 (?half of/from cake?). Note that here the noun cake is indefinite in
Romanian, and thus the instance is generic. An existential interpretation is possible
when the noun is modified by a possessive (e.g., half of your cake).
Measure partitives are also called vague PART?WHOLE relations (Selkirk 1982b)
because they can express both PART?WHOLE and MEASURE depending on the context.
They are encoded by N1 of N2 constructions, where N2 is indefinite, and can indi-
cate both existential and generic interpretations. Two such examples are bottles/Arg1 of
wine/Arg2 and cup/Arg1 of sugar/Arg2. In Romanian, the preposition used is either de
(of ), or cu (with). For example, sticle/Arg1 de/cu vin/Arg2 (?bottles of/with wine?) and
ceas?ca?/Arg1 de/cu zaha?r/Arg2 (?cup of/with sugar?).
Fraction partitives indicate fractions of wholes, such as three quarters/Arg2 of a
pie/Arg1 (trei pa?trimi/Arg2 de pla?cinta?/Arg1 [Romanian]?[?three quarters of pie?]) and one
third/Arg2 of the nation/Arg1 (o treime/Arg2 din populat?ia/Arg1 [Romanian]?[?one third from
population-the?] and not o treime de populat?ia ? [?a third of population-the?]). Here again,
we notice the choice of the Romanian preposition din and not de when the second noun
is definite. The preposition from indicates the idea of separation of the part from the
whole, an idea which characterizes PART?WHOLE relations.
Portion?Mass relations cannot be encoded by N N structures in either English or
Romanian and they are not symmetric in N P N constructions.
(4) Member?Collection
This subtype represents membership in a collection. Members are parts, but may
not play any functional role with respect to their whole. That is, compared with
Component?Integral instances such as the knob of the door, where the knob is a round
handle one turns in order to open a door, in an example like bunch of cats, the cats don?t
play any functional role to the whole bunch.
This subtype can be further classified into a basic subtype (e.g., the member of the
team), count partitives (e.g., two of these people), fraction count partitives (e.g., two
out of three workers), and vague measure partitives (e.g., a number/lot/bunch of cats).
Although the basic Member?Collection partitives are symmetric for N N (Romanian
only) and N P N (English and Romanian), the other subtypes can be encoded only by
N P N constructions and are not symmetric in English or in Romanian. For example,
the children/Arg2 of the group/Arg1 and children/Arg2 group/Arg1 translate as copiii/Arg2
din grup/Arg1 (?children-the from group?) and as grup/Arg1 de copii/Arg2 (?group of
children?).
The second and the third subtypes translate in Romanian as doi/Arg2 din aces?ti
oameni/Arg1 (?two from these people?) and doi/Arg2 din trei lucra?tori/Arg1 (?two from three
workers?), by always using the preposition din ( from) instead of de (of ). On the other
hand, vague measure partitives translate as un numa?r/Arg1 de pisici/Arg2 (?a number of
cats?) and not as un numa?r din pisici (?a number from cats?). Although all these subtypes
need to have a plural modifier noun and are not symmetric, count partitives always
have an existential interpretation, whereas fraction count and vague measure partitives
have a generic meaning.
(5) Location?Area
This subtype captures the relation between areas and special places and locations
within them. The parts are similar to their wholes, but they are not separable from
them. Thus, this relation overlaps with the LOCATION relation. One such example is the
surface/Arg2 of the water/Arg1. Both nouns can be either definite or indefinite and the rela-
tion is not symmetric when the part is a relational noun (e.g., surface, end). In Romanian,
221
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
both N de N and genitive-marked N N constructions are possible: suprafat?a/Arg2
apei/Arg1 (?surface-the water-GEN?) and suprafat?a?/Arg2 de apa?/Arg1 (?surface of water?).
The relation is symmetric only for N P N in both English and Romanian.
Table 11 summarizes the symmetry properties of all five PART?WHOLE subtypes
accompanied by examples.
Thus, features such as the semantic classes of the two nouns (F1, F2), and the syntac-
tic constructions in English and Romanian?more specifically, the preposition features
for English (F5) and Romanian (F12) and the inflection feature for Romanian (F13)?
can be used to train a classifier for the identification of the argument order in nominal
phrases and compounds encoding different subtypes of PART?WHOLE relations. For
example, the argument order for Portion?Mass instances can be easily identified if it is
determined that they are encoded byN2 of/de N1 in English and Romanian and the head
noun N2 is identified as a fraction in the WordNet IS-A hierarchy, thus representing Arg2
(the part). It is interesting to note here that all the other Member?Collection subtypes with
the exception of the basic one are also encoded only by N of/de N, but here the order
is reversed in both English and Romanian (N1 of/de N2), where the head noun N1, if
identified as a collection concept in WordNet, represents the whole concept (Arg1).
This approach can also be applied to other symmetric relations by classifying them
into more specific subtypes for argument order identification. Thus, local classifiers
can be trained for each subtype on features such as those mentioned herein and tested
on unseen instances. However, for training this procedure requires a sufficiently large
number of examples for each subtype of the semantic relation considered.

Girju The Syntax and Semantics of Prepositions
This analysis shows that the choice of lexico-syntactic structures in both English and
Romanian correlates with the meaning of the instances encoded by such structures. In
the next section we present a list of errors and situations that, currently, our system fails
to recognize, and suggest possible improvements.
7. Error Analysis and Suggested Improvements
A major part of the difficulty of interpreting nominal phrases and compounds stems
from multiple sources of ambiguity. These factors range from syntactic analysis, to
semantic, pragmatic, and contextual information and translation issues. In this section
we show various sources of error we found in our experiments and present some
possible improvements.
A. Error analysis
Two basic factors are wrong part-of-speech and word sense disambiguation tags. Thus,
if the syntactic tagger and WSD system fail to annotate the nouns with the correct senses,
the system can generate wrong semantic classes which will lead to wrong conclusions.
Moreover, there were also instances for which the nouns or the corresponding senses of
these nouns were not found in WordNet. There were 42.21% WSD and 6.7% POS tagging
errors in Europarl and 54.8% and 7.32% in CLUVI. Additionally, 6.9% (Europarl) and
4.6% (CLUVI) instances had missing senses.
There are also cases when local contextual information such as word sense disam-
biguation is not enough for relation detection and when access to a larger discourse
context is needed. Various researchers (Spa?rck Jones 1983; Lascarides and Copestake
1998; Lapata 2002) have shown that the interpretation of noun?noun compounds, for
example, may be influenced by discourse and pragmatic knowledge. This context may
be identified at the level of local nominal phrases and compounds or sentences or at the
document and even collection level. For example, a noun?noun compound modified
by a relative clause might be disambiguated in the context of another argument of the
same verb in the clause, which can limit the number of possible semantic relations. For
instance, the interpretation of the instance museum book in the subject position in the
following examples is influenced by another argument of the verbs bought in Exam-
ple (18), and informed in Example (19):
(18) the [museum book]TOPIC John bought in the bookshop at the museum
(19) the [museum book]LOCATION that informed John about the ancient art
Prepositions such as spatial ones are also amenable to visual interpretations due
to their usage in various visual contexts. For example, the instance nails in the box (cf.
Herskovits 1987) indicates two possible arrangements of the nails: either held by the
box, or hammered into it. We cannot capture these subtleties with the current procedure
even if they are mentioned in the context of the sentence or discourse.
B. Suggested improvements
In this article we investigated the contribution of English and Romance prepositions to
the task of interpreting nominal phrases and compounds, both as features employed
in a learning model and as classification categories. An interesting extension of this
approach would be to look into more detail at the functional?semantic aspect of these
prepositions and to define various tests that would classify them as pure functional
components with no semantic content or semantic devices with their own meaning.
223
Computational Linguistics Volume 35, Number 2
Moreover, our experiments focused on the detection of semantic relations encoded
by N N and N P N patterns. A more general approach would extend the investigation
to adjective?noun constructions in English and Romance languages as well.
Another direction for future work is the study of the semantic (ir)regularities among
English and Romance nominal phrases and compounds in both directions. Such an
analysis might be also useful for machine translation, especially when translating into a
language with multiple choices of syntactic constructions. One such example is tarro
de cerveza (?glass of beer?) in Spanish which can be translated as either glass of beer
(MEASURE) or beer glass (PURPOSE) in English. The current machine translation language
models do not differentiate between such options, choosing the most frequent instance
in a large training corpus.
The drawback of the approach presented in this article, as for other very precise
learning methods, is the need for a large number of training examples. If a certain
class of negative or positive examples is not seen in the training data (and therefore
it is not captured by the classification rules), the system cannot classify its instances.
Thus, the larger and more diverse the training data, the better the classification rules.
Moreover, each cross-linguistic study requires translated data, which is not easy to
obtain in electronic form, especially for most of the world?s languages. However, more
and more parallel corpora in various languages are expected to be forthcoming.
8. Discussion and Conclusions
In this article we investigated the contribution of English and Romance prepositions to
the interpretation of N N and N P N instances and presented a supervised, knowledge-
intensive interpretation model.
Our approach to the interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds is novel
in several ways. We investigated the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from
a set of six languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian.
Thus, we presented empirical observations on the distribution of nominal phrases and
compounds and the distribution of their meanings on two different corpora, based
on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer?s set of eight prepositions (Lauer
1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations. A mapping between the two tag sets was
also provided. A supervised learning model employing various linguistic features was
successfully compared against two state-of-the-art models reported in the literature.
It is also important to mention here the linguistic implications of this work. We
hope that the corpus investigations presented in this article provide new insight for the
machine translation and multilingual question answering communities. The translation
of nominal phrase and compound instances from one language to another is highly
correlated with the structure of each language, or set of languages. In this article we
measured the contribution of a set of five Romance languages to the task of semantic in-
terpretation of English nominal phrases and compounds. More specifically, we showed
that the Romanian linguistic features contribute more substantially to the overall per-
formance than the features obtained for the other Romance languages. The choice of
the Romanian linguistic constructions (either N N or N P N) is highly correlated with
their meaning. This distinct behavior of Romanian constructions is also explained by
the Slavic and Balkanic influences. An interesting future research direction would be to
consider other Indo- and non Indo-European languages and measure their contribution
to the task of interpreting nominal phrases and compounds in particular, and noun
phrases in general.
