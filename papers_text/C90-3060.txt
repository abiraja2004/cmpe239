Mach ine  Trans la t ion  f rom German in to  
Russ ian  d id  not ga in  the a t tent ion  it 
deserves  so far. Espec ia l l y  such  typ ica l  
Russ ian  phenomena l ike  the aspect  of verbs  
compl ica te  the t rans la t ion  process .  The 
known MT approaches  do not dea l  w i th  such  
prob lems in a sa t i s fac tory  way. To over -  
come th is  lack, we s tar ted  the German.- 
Russ ian  t rans la t ion  exper iment  VIRTEX.  We 
focussed  our  a t tent ion  on the c ruc ia l  
po in t  -- a h igh  qua l i ty  t rans la t ion  of 
verba l  g roups  (V IRTEX = Verbs - in to -  
Russ ian  Trans la t ion  Exper iment ) .  That  
means,  V IRTEX is made to so lve  on pr inc i -  
ple the l ingu is t i c  d i f f i cu l t ies  connected  
w i th  verb  t rans la t ion :  
- recogn i t ion  of German ana ly t i ca l  tense  
forms, pass ive  const ruct ions ,  re f lex ive  
fo rms and verbs  w i th  detached pre f ixes  
- ana lys i s  of complex  German verb  groups  
(moda l  and moda l - l i ke  const ruct ions )

fo rm 
pass ive -act ive  t rans format ion  in case  of 
miss ing  Russ ian  pass ive  fo rm 
adequate  t rans la t ion  of moda l  const ruc -

The used  vocabu lary ,  above  200 sample  
verbs, is se lec ted  to represent  these  
phenomena complete ly .  
To t rans la te  verba l  g roups  adequate ly ,  
?t is necessary  to have some context .  
Tbere fore  we accept  as input  s imp le  sen-  
tence  9 w i th  verb  complements  and adver -  
bials.  That  means  we have a l so  a set of 
nouns, p ronouns ,  adverbs  and some other  
words, The res t r i c ted  syntax  mode l  is made 
for shor t  ma in  c lauses ;  it exc ludes  rela-- 
t i re  and o ther  subord inated  c lauses ,  at -  
t r ibutes  and in f in i t i ve  c lauses  w i th  
complements .  V IRTEX can  be c lass i f ied  as 
an NT sys tem between second and th i rd  
generat ion  w i th  a syntact i c  in ter face  
s t ruc ture  completed  by some semant ic  in-  
fo rmat ion .  The sys tem's  a rch i tec ture  is 
the c lass ica l  one. Ana lys i s ,  T rans fer  and 
Synthes is  are sequent ia l l y  p rocessed  sepa-  
ra te  rout ines .  For each  of them an ext ra  
lex icon  has been  imp lemented .  The input -  
work  is suppor ted  by spec ia l  too ls  inc lud-  
ing  an automat ic  generat ion  of the in f lec -  
t iona l  types. Whi le  the procedures  are 
wr i t ten  in LISP, the d ic t ionar ies  and 
the i r  ed i to rs  are made in dBASE. The 
fo rmat  res t r i c t ions  of dBASE are compen-  
sa ted  by a spec ia l  management  of the en-  
t r ies  and a cor respond ing  way  of L ISP  
access  to them. V IRTEX runs on PC-XT. 
Some s teps  of the sys tem wi l l  shor t ly

ANALYS IS  
The lex ica l  .entr ies for  German syntac -  
tic ana lys i s  are taken  f rom the ana lys i s  
d ic t ionary  wh ich  is combined  w i th  a sys tem 
of in f lec t ion  l ists;  an ana lys i s  of in-  
f lec t iona l  end ings  is embedded in the 
d ic t ionary  access.  A word  fo rm ent ry  con-  
ta ins  word  c lass  in fo rmat ion ,  morpho log i -  
cal features  and values,  some semant ic  
in fo rmat ion  and the name of the lexeme. 
Whi le  the sys tem is runn ing,  the l i s t s  of 
in fo rmat ion  and features  are conver ted  
1 321 
i n to  numbers .  
For  syntact i c  pars ing  an ATN-grammar  is 
used  to recogn ize  nomina l  and prepos i t io  ~ 
nal phrases ,  adverb ia l s  and verbs  or 
verba l  groups.  A spec ia l  embedded program 
ana lyzes  the verb  const i tuents .  Homonymous  
morpho log ica l  and word  c lass  features  are 
d i sambiguated  as far  as poss ib le  th rough-  
out the pars ing  process.  
TRANSFER 
Al l  t rans fer  ru les  are wr i t ten  w i th in  
our  t ree  t rans format ion ' language GRACOLI .  
Th is  is a un iversa l  so f tware  too l  deve-  
loped  to hand le  MT t rans f , r  p rob lems.  
GI~ACOLI manages  the input  and process ing  
of t ree  rewr i t ing  rules.  One ru le  cons is ts  
of a le f t  s ide  and a r ight  s ide  tree. 
Accord ing  to the usua l  notat ion  of syntac -  
t ic  tress,  every  t ree node can  be labe l led  
by a f in i te  set  of a t t r ibute -va lue-pa i rs .  
So  we have  got a un iversa l  ru le  fo rmat  for  
s t ruc ture  chang ing  w i th  ass ignment  of new 
labe ls  depend ing  on the occur rence  of the 
le f t  s ide  s t ruc ture  and le f t  s ide  labe l  
cond i t ions .  It inc ludes  al l  s imp l ie r  
t rans fer  ac t ions  l i ke  labe l  tests ,  
s t ruc ture  tests,  lex ica l  t rans fer  etc. The 
compi la t ion  of GRACOLI  ru le  sequences  in 
GRACOLI  g rammars  a l lows  h igh  ev idence  and 
easy  cor rect ion  of imp lemented  t rans fer  
a lgor i thms.  
The t rans fer  lex icon  compr ises  al l  
l exeme-dependent  t rans la t ion  in fo rmat ion .  
As for  the verbs  in case  of lex ica l  ambi -  
guity,  the equ iva lents  are l i s ted  in an 
order  su i tab le  for  se lec t ing  the 
appropr ia te  one by check ing  
(I) character i s t i cs  of va lency  f rames,  
(2) semant ic  features  of verb  comple -  
ments  or 
(3) o ther  cond i t ions .  
ad I) E.g.. the verb  e in t rs ten  may be 
d i sambiguated  by the prepos i t ions :  
e in t re~en f~r - v ~tuDat j  za 
' to  s tand  up for' ;  
s in t re ten  in - vs tupat~ v 
' to jo in  sth. ' 
ad 2) One or  more  semant ic  features  are  
a t t r ibuted  to  nouns .  They  may be used  fo r  
d i sambiguat ion ,  e .g . :  
abseh l ie~en (accusat ive  inan imated) ,  
-> ~ ' to  lock' 
abseh l ieBen (accusat ive  process )  
-> zakanch ivat  i ' to  te rminate '  
ad 3) Concrete  noun lexemes  can  a l so  be 
used  as f i l l e rs  of verb  s lots,  e.g. 
absch l ieBen (accusat ive  Ver t ra~ 
'cont ract ' )  
-> zak luchat j  (do_govor) 
' to conc lude '  . 
The fo rm of lex ica l  ent r ies  a l lows  to 
adapt  them as GRACOLI  rules. Wi th  the he ld  
of the t rans fer  lex icon  lex iea l  and va len-  
cy  f rame t rans fer  is managed s imul taneous~ 
IF. Pass ive  sentences  get a spec ia l  pre~ 
process ing  be fore  the lex icon  is con-  
su l ted.  A f te r  this, two d is t ingu ished  
GRACOLI  p rocedures  for ac t ive  and pass ive  
vo ice  se lec t  the aspect  fo rm accord ing  to 
a h ie rarchy  of c r i te r ia .  Three  groups  of 
such  c r i te r ia  are d i s t ingu ished:  
(I) a lex iea l  c r i te r ion ,  
(2) syntact i c - semant ic  c r i te r ia  and 
(3) German tense  c r i te r ia .  
ed I) For  cer ta in  German verbs,  the t rans -  
fer  lex icon  spec i f ies  wh ich  of the two 
aspects  of the Russ ian  equ iva lent  has to 
be chosen,  e.g. 
P r~fun~ bestehen 
-> sdat  i ~kzamen (per fec t ive  aspect )  
' to  pass  an examinat ion '  
s i ch  bemhhen um 
-> dob ivat  s a ( imper fec t ive  aspect )  
' to  t ry  hard' .  
ad 2) In some eases  verba l  aspect  depends  
on the va lency  f rame of the German verb  
or /and  on semant ic  features  of comple -  
ments: 
EF schr ieb  an e inem Such  
-) On p isg l  kn l _~ 'he wrote  a book' 
(p repos i t ion  an, case  dat ive  
--> imper fec t ive  aspect ) .  
The reoccur rence  of  verbs  w i th  cer ta in  
types  of adverb ia l s  in f luences  the verba l  
aspect  cho ice,  too. Adverbs  l i ke  jahre lang  
322 2 
' f o r  years ' ,  ~ 'o,  f ten ' ,  z n_E99_e_h~hmend 
'more and more' demand the imperfeet ive  
aspect ,  but ~l~ts! ich .  ' sudden ly ' ,  unerwar -  
te__~t 'unexpected ' ,  d e ~  'soo~' the 
per fec t ive  one. If there  occur  adverb ia l s  
of both  types  w i th in  the sentence ,  the 
cho ice  of Imper feet ive  aspect  is p re fer -  
t'ed~ 
ad 3) I f  none  o f  the  a foresa id  c r i te r ia  
app l ies ,  the  tense  o f  the  f in i te  German 
verb  determines  the  verba l  aspect :  
fu ture ,  per fec t ,  p luper fec t  
=-> per fec t ive  aspect  
present . .  --> imper fec t ive  aspect  
In case  o f 'p re ter i te ,  per fec t  and fu ture  
semant ic  verb  subc lass i f i ca t ion  as wel l  as  
def in i teness  of the di.rect ob jec t  are 
add i t iona l ly  taken  into account .  
A separate  GRACOLI  g rammar  is a l so  used 
to car ry  out  the s t ruc tura l  t rans fer  of 
moda l  const ruct ions  because  the descr ip -  
t ion  of the complex  cond i t ions  of these  
const ruct ions  does  not f ig in the f rame of  
the lex ica l  ent r ies  of the t rans fer  d ic -  
t ionary.  Th is  sha l l  be demonst ra ted  by the 
t rans la t ion  of the  German verb  k~nnen 
' can ' ,  ' to be ab le  to'. It is necessary  to 
se lec t  a l im i ted  number  of t rans la t ion  
pat terns  because  of the w ide  var ie ty  of 
cor respond ing  Russ ian  const ruct ions .  Thus  
two Russ ian  const ruct ions  were  taken  in to  
cons iderat ion .  The i r  cho ice  depends  main ly  
on the k ind  of the sub jec t  and the vo ice  
of the in f in i t i ve .  
(I) The impersona l  const ruct ion  w i th  the 
pred icat ive  mozhn_qo ' i t  is poss ib le '  is 
se lec ted  if one of the fo l low ing  cond i -  
t ions  to the sub jec t  is fu l f i l l ed :  
- i nde f in i te -persona l  p ronoun man or 
- a nounphrase  wh ich  be longs  to the sub-  
c lass  'p rocess ' ,  or 
- a fo rmal  is, or 
there  is no sub ject ,  
for  example :  
Es kan n ( ibm) geho l fen .werden.  
' I t  is poss ib le  to he lp  him.' 
-> Emu me,hag  omoch '  
(2) The persona l  const ruct ion  w i th  a f i -  
n l te  fo rm of the. moda l  verb  moth& 'can',  
' to  be ab le  to' is ~ pre fer red  if: 
- none of the above  g iven  cond i t ions  is 
app l i cab le ,  and if 
- the sub jec t  is a persona l  ODe, 
for  example:  
EP kann d ie  Aufsabe  l~sen  
'He is ab le  to so lve  the task' 
-> On moshet  resh i t j  zadachu.  
SYNTHESIS  
The t rans fer  resu l t  is a const i tuent  
s t ruc ture  conta in ing  the Russ ian  equ iva -  
lents  and in fo rmat ion  for  syntact i c  and 
morpho log ica l  synthes is .  S ince  the va len-  
cy  f rame t rans fer  is a l ready  done, on ly  
some tasks  remain  for  syntact i c  synthes is .  
The Russ ian  verbs!must  be expanded if they  
demand ana ly t i ca l  fcrms,  that  ho lds  for  
future,  sub junct ive  and pass ive  const ruc -  
t ions. Adverb ia l  g roups  wh ich  are hand led  
as on ly  one const i tuent  w i l l  get the i r  
exp l i c i t  fo rm now. Gender  agreement  for  
Russ ian  preter i te  and re f lex ive  fo rms is 
fo rmed here. Fur thermore ,  ~usa ian  word  
order  p rocess ing  is done. 
Input  of the morpho log ica l  synthes is  
are the resu l t s  of the prev ious  steps. 
In fo rmat ion  of the Russ ian  d ic t ionary  
ent r ies  is combined  w i th  the in f lec t iona l

The exper imenta l  sys tem V IRTEX proposes  
a so lu t ion  for the aspect  prob lem,  and is 
there fore  not on ly  a new one in the long  
l i s t  of ex i s t ing  MT systems,  but a sub-  
s tant ia l  cont r ibut ion  to MT research .  
V IRTEX wi l l  be demonst ra ted  at COL ING ' 90.
