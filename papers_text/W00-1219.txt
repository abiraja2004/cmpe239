Abstract 
This paper is to introduce a statistical 
method to extract Chinese compound words 
from a very large corpusL This method is 
based on mutual information and context 
dependency. Experimental results show that 
this method is efficient and robust 
compared with other approaches. We also 
examined the impact of different parameter 
settings, corpus size and heterogeneousness 
on the extraction results. We finally present 
results on information retrieval to show the 
usefulness of extracted compounds. 
1 Introduction 
Almost all techniques to statistical anguage 
processing, including speech recognition, machine 
translation and information retrieval, are based on 
words. Although word-based approaches work 
very well for western languages, where words are 
well defined, it is difficult to apply to Chinese. 
Chinese sentences are written as characters strings 
with no spaces between words. Therefore, words 
in Chinese are actually not well marked in 
sentences, and there does not exist a commonly 
accepted Chinese lexicon. 
Furthermore, since new compounds (words 
formed with at least wo characters) are constantly 
created, it is impossible to list them exhaustively 
in a lexicon. Therefore, automatic extraction of 
compounds is an important issue. Traditional 
extraction approaches used rules. However, 
compounds extracted in this way are not always 
desirable. So, human effort is still required to find 
the preferred compounds from a large compound

Microsoft Research China as a visiting student. 
candidate list. Some statistical approaches to 
extract Chinese compounds from corpus have 
been proposed (Lee-Feng Chien 1997, WU Dekai 
and Xuanyin XIA 1995, Ming-Wen Wu and Keh- 
Yih Su 1993) as well, but almost all experiments 
are based on relatively small corpus, it is not clear 
whether these methods till work well with large 
corpus. 
In this paper, we investigate statistical 
approaches to Chinese compound extraction from 
very large corpus by using statistical features, 
namely mutual information and context 
dependency. There are three main contributions in
this paper. First, we apply our procedure on a very 
large corpus while other experiments were based 
on small or medium size corpora. We show that 
better esults can be obtained with a large corpus. 
Second, we examine how the results can be 
influenced by parameter settings including mutual 
information and context dependency restrictions. 
It turns out that mutual information mainly affects 
precision while context dependency affects the 
count of extracted items. Third, we test the 
usefulness of the extracted compounds for 
information retrieval. Our experimental results on 
IR show that the new compounds have a positive 
effect on IR. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In 
section 2, we describe the techniques we used. In 
section 3, we present several sets of experimental 
results. In section 4, we outline the related works 
as well as their results. Finally, we give our 
conclusions in section 5. 
2 Technique description 
Statistical extraction of Chinese compounds has 
been used in (Lee-Feng Chien 1997)(WU Dekai 
and Xuanyin XIA 1995) and (Ming-Wen Wu and 
Keh-Yih Su 1993). The basic idea is that a 
132 
Chinese compound should appear as a stable 
sequence in corpus. That is, the components in the 
compound are strongly correlated, while the 
components lie at both ends should have low 
correlations with otiter words. 
The method consists of two steps. At fast, a fist 
of candidate compounds i extracted from a very 
large corpus by using mutual information. Then, 
context dependency is used to remove undesirable 
compounds. In what follows, we will describe 
them in more detail. 
2.1 Mutual Information 
According to our study on Chinese corpora, 
most compounds are of length less than 5 
characters. The average length of words in the 
segmented-corpus i of approximately 1.6 
characters. Therefore, only word bi-gram, tn'- 
gram, and quad-gram in the corpus are of interest 
to us in compound extraction. 
We use a criterion, called mutual inform~on, 
to evaluate the correlation of different components 
in the compound. Mutual information Ml(x,y) of a 
bi-gram (x, y) is estimated by: 
Ml(x ,y )  = f (x ,y )  
f (x )  + f (y ) -  f (x ,y )  
Where f(x) is the occurrence frequency of word 
x in the corpus, and fix, y) is the occurrence 
frequency of the word pair (x,y) in the corpus. The 
higher the value of MI is, the more likely x and y 
are to form a compound. 
The mutual information MI(x,y,z) of tri-gram 
(x,y,z) is estimated by: 
Ml(x,  y, z) = f (x ,  y, z) 
f (x)  + f (y)  + f ( z ) -  f(x,  y, z) 
The estimation of mutual information of quad- 
grams is similar to that of tri-grams. The extracted 
compounds should be of higher value of MI than a 
pre-set threshold. 
2.2 Context Dependency 
Figure 1 
The extracted Chinese compounds hould be 
complete. That is, we should generate a whole 
word, not a part of it. For example, 
~,~-~-~t'~J(missi le defense plan) is a 
complete word, and -~.~0-1~J~ (missile defense) is
not, although both have relatively high value of 
mutual information. 
Therefore, we use another feature, called 
context dependency. The contexts of the word 
l~(defense)  are illustrated by figure 1. 
A compound X has NO left context dependency 
if 
LSize -~ L I > tl or 
f (ctX)  MaxL = MAX ~ - -  < t2 
f (X )  
Where tl, t2 are threshold value, j\[.) is 
frequency, L is the set of left adjacent strings of X, 
tz~L and ILl means the number of unique left 
adjacent strings. Similarly, a compound X has NO 
right context dependency if 
RSize ~ R l> t3 or 
f ( /~)  < t4 MaxR = MAX a f ( X ) 
Where tl, t2, t3, t4 are threshold value, f(.) is 
frequency, R is the set of right adjacent strings of 
X, tiER and \[R I means the number of unique left 
adjacent strings. 
The extracted complete compounds should have 
neither left nor fight context dependency. 
3 Experimental results 
In our experiments, three corpora were used to 
test the performance of the presented approach. 
These corpora re described in table 1. Corpus A 
consists of local news with more than 325 million 
characters. Corpus B consists of documents from 
different domains of novel, news, technique 
report, etc., with approximately 650 million 
characters. Corpus C consists of People's Daily 
news and Xinhua news from TREC5 and TREC6 
(Harman and Voorhees, 1996) with 75 million 
characters.

In the first experiment, we test the perfomaance 
of our method on corpus A, which is homogeneity 
in style. We then use corpus B in the second 
experiment totest if the method works as well on 
the corpus that is heterogeneity n style. We also 
use different parameter settings in order to figure 
out the best combination of the two statistical 
features, i.e. mutual information and context 
dependency. In the third experiment, we apply the 
results of the method to information retrieval 
system. We extract new compounds on corpus C, 
and add them to the indexing lexicon, and we 
achieve a higher average precision-recall. In all 
experiments, corpora re segmented automatically 
into words using a lexicon consisting of 65,502 
entries. 
3.1 Compounds Extraction from Homogeneous 
Corpus 
Corpus A contains political and economic news. 
In this series of tests, we gradually loosen the 
conditions to form a compound, i.e. MI threshold 
becomes smaller and MaxL/MaxR becomes larger. 
Results for quad-graras, tri-graras and bi-grams 
are shown in tables 2,3,4. Some compounds 
extracted are fisted in table 5.

It turns out that our algorithm successfully 
extracted a large number of new compounds 
(>50000) from raw texts. Compared with previous 
methods described in the next section, the 
precision is very high. We can also find that there 
is little precision loss when we loose restriction. 
The result may be due to three reasons. First, the 
two statistical features really characterize the 
nature of compounds, and provide a simple and 
efficient way to estimate the possibility of a word 
sequence being a compound. Second, the corpus 
we use is very large. It is always true that more 
data leads to better esults. Third, the corpus we 
used in this experiment is homogeneity in style. 
The raw corpus is composed of news on politics, 
economy, science and technology. These are 
formal articles, and the sentences and compounds 
are well normalized and strict. This is very helpful 
for compound extraction. 
3.2 Compounds Extraction from Heterogeneous 
Corpus 
In this experiment, we use a heterogeneous 
corpus. It is a combination of corpus A, and some 
other novels, technique reports, etc. For 
simplicity, we discuss the extraction of bi-gram 
compounds only. In comparison with the first 
experiment, we find that the precision is strongly 
affected by the corpus we used. As shown in table 
6, for each corpus, we use the same parameter 
setting, say MI >0.005, LSize >3, MaxL <0.5, 
RSize>3 and MaxR<0.5. 
Table 6: Impact of heterogeneousness of corpora 
Corpus Compounds Extract 
extracted precision 
Corpus A 32899 97.3% 
(4041415) 
Corpus B 36383 88.3% 
(362/410) 
As we mentioned early, the larger the corpus we 
use, the better results we obtain. Therefore, we 
intuitively expect better esult on corpus B, which 
is larger than corpus A. But, the result shown in 
table 6 is just the opposite. 
There are mainly two reasons for this. The first 
one is that our method works better on 
homogeneous corpus than on heterogeneous 
corpus. The second one is that it might not be 
suitable to use the same parameter settings on two 
different corpora. We then try different parameter 
settings on corpus B. 
There are two groups of parameters. MI 
measures the correlation between adjacent words, 
and other four parameters, namely LSize, RSize, 
MaxL, and MaxR, measure the context 
dependency. Therefore, each time, we fix one 
parameter, and relax another from fight to loose to 
see what happens. The Number of extracted 
compounds and precision of each parameter 
setting are shown in table 7.

Table 7 shows the extraction results with 
different parameters. These results fit our 
intuition. While parameters become more and 
more strict, less and less compounds are found 
and precisions become higher. This phenomena is
also illustrated in figure 2 and 3, in which the 
"correct compounds extracted" is an estimation 
from tableT, i.e. number of compounds found x 
precision. (These two figures are very useful for 
one who wants to automatically extract a new 
lexicon with pre-defined size from a large corpus.)

The precision of extraction is estimated in the 
following way. We extract a set of compounds 
based on a seres of pre-defined parameter set. For 
each set of compotinds, we randomly select 200 
compounds. Then we merge those selected 
compounds to a new file for manually check. This 
file consists of about 9,800 new compounds 
because there are 49 compounds lists. One person 
will group these 'compounds' into two sets, say 
set A and set B. Set A contains the items that are 
considered to be correct, and set B contains 
incorrect ones. Then for each original group of 
about 200 compounds we select in the first step, 
we check how many items that also appear in set 
A and how many items in set B. Suppose these 
two values are al and bl, then we estimate the 
precision as al/(al+bl). 
So, there are two important points in our 
evaluation process. First, it is difficult to give a 
definition of the term "compound" to be accepted 
popularly. Different people may have different 
judgement. Only one person takes part in the 
evaluation in our experiment. This can eliminate 
the effect of divergence among different persons. 
Second, we merge those items together. This can 
eliminate the effect of different ime period. One 
may feel tired after checked too many items. If he 
checks those 49 files one by one, the latter results 
are incomparable with the previous one. 
The precisions estimated by the above method 
are not exactly correct. However, as described 
above, the precisions of different parameter 
settings are comparable. In this experiment, what 
we want to show is how the parameter settings 
affect he results. 
Both MI and CD can affect number of extracted 
compounds, as shown in table 7. Compared with 
MI, CD has stronger effect in this aspect. For each 
row in table 7, numbers of extracted compounds 
finally decrease to 10% of that showed in the first 
column. For each column, while MI changes from 
0.0002 to 0.0014, the number is decreased of 
about 20%. This may be explained by the fact that 
it is difficult for candidate to fulfill all four 
restrictions in CD simultaneously. Many 
disqualified candidates are cut off. Table 7 lists 
the precisions of extracted results. It shows that 
there is no clear increasing/decreasing pattern in 
each row. That is to say, CD doesn't strongly 
affect he precision. When we check each column, 
we can see that precision is in a growing progress. 
As we defined above, MI and CD are two 
different measurements. What role they play in 
our extraction procedure? Our conclusion is that 
mutual information mainly affects the precision 
while context dependency mainly affects the count 
of extracted items. This conclusion is also 
confirmed by Fig2 and Fig3. That is, the curves in 
Fig2 are more fiat than corresponding curves in 
Fig3. 
3.3 Testing the Extracted Compounds in 
Information Retrieval 
In this experiment, we apply our method to 
improve information retrieval results. We use 
SMART system (Buckley 1985) for our 
experiments. SMART is a robust, efficient and 
flexible information retrieval system. The corpus 
used in this experiment is TREC Chinese corpus 
(Harman and Voorhees, 1996). The corpus 
contains about 160,000 articles, including articles 
published in the People's Daily from 1991 to 
1993, and a part of the news released by the 
Xinhua News Agency in 1994 and 1995. A set of 
54 queries has been set up and evaluated by 
people in NIST(Nafional Institute of Standards 
and Technology). 
We first use an initial lexicon consisting of 
65,502 entries to segment the corpus. When 
running SMART on the segmented corpus, we 
obtain an average precision of 42.90%. 
Then we extract new compounds from the 
segmented corpus, and add them into the initial 
lexicon. With the new lexicon, the TREC Chinese 
corpus is re-segmented. When running SMART 
on this re-segmented corpus, we obtain an average 
precision of 43.42%, which shows a slight 
improvement of 1.2%. 
Further analysis shows that the new lexicon 
brings positive effect to 10 queries and negative 
effect to 4 queries. For other 40 queries, there is 
no obvious effect. Some improved queries are 
listed in table 8 as well as new compounds being 
contained. 
As an example, we give the segmentation 
results with the two lexicons for query 23 in table 
9.

Another interesting example is query 30. There 
is no new compound extracted from that query. Its 
result is also improved significantly because its 
relevant documents are segmented better than 
before. 
Because the compounds extracted from the 
corpus are not exactly correct, the new lexicon 
will bring negative ffect o some queries, such as 
query 10. The retrieval precision changes from 
0.3086 to 0.1359. The main reason is that 
"~ \ [ \ ]~" (Ch inese  XinJiang) is taken as a new 
compound in the query. 
4 Related works 
Several methods have been proposed for 
extracting compounds from corpus by statistical 
approaches. In this section, we will briefly 
describe some of them. 
(Lee-Feng Chien 1997) proposed an approach 
based on PAT-Tree to automatically extracting 
domain specific terms from online text 
collections. Our method is primary derived from 
(Lee-Feng Chien 1997), and use the similar 
statistical features, i.e. mutual informan'on and 
context dependency. The difference is that we use 
n-gram instead of PAT-Tree, due to the efficiency 
issue. Another difference lies in the experiments. 
In Chien's work, only domain specific terms are 
extracted from domain specific corpus, and the 
size of the corpus is relatively small, namely 
1,872 political news abstracts. 
(Cheng-Huang Tung and His-Jian Lee 1994) 
also presented an efficient method for identifying 
unknown words from a large corpus. The 
statistical features used consist of string (character 
sequence) frequency and entropy of left/fight 
neighbonng characters (similar to left/fight 
context dependency). The corpus consists of 
178,027 sentences, representing a total of more 
than 2 million Chinese characters. 8327 unknown 
words were identified and 5366 items of them 
were confirmed manually. 
(Ming-Wen Wu and Keh-Yih Su 1993) 
presented a method using mutual information and 
relative frequency. 9,124 compounds are extracted 
from the corpus consists of 74,404 words, with the 
precision of 47.43%. In this method, the 
compound extraction problem is formulated as 
classification problem. Each bi-grarn (tri-grarn) is 
assigned to one of those two clusters. It also needs 
a training corpus to estimate parameters for 
classification model. In our method, we didn't 
138 
make use of any training corpus. Another 
difference is that they use the method for English 
compounds extraction while we extract Chinese 
compounds in our experiments. 
(Pascale Fung 1998) presented two simple 
systems for Chinese compound extraction---- 
CXtract. CXtract uses predominantly statistical 
lexical information to find term boundaries in 
large text. Evaluations on the corpus consisting of 
2 million characters show that the average 
precision is 54.09%. 
We should note that since the experiment setup 
and evaluation systems of the methods mentioned 
above are not identical, the results are not 
comparable. However, by showing our 
experimental results on much larger and 
heterogenous corpus, we can say that our method 
is an efficient and robust one. 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper, we investigate a statistical 
approach to Chinese compounds extraction from 
very large corpora using mutual information and 
context dependency. 
We explained how the performance can be 
influenced by different parameter settings, corpus 
size, and corpus heterogeneousness. We also 
refine the lexicon with information retrieval 
system by adding compounds obtained by our 
methods, and achieve 1.2% improvements on 
precision of IR. 
Through our experiments, we conclude that 
statistical method based on mutual information 
and context dependency is efficient and robust for 
Chinese compounds extraction. And, mutual 
information mainly affects the precision while 
context dependency mainly affects the count of 
extracted items.
