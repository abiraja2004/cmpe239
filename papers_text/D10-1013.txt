Abstract
Targeted paraphrasing is a new approach to the
problem of obtaining cost-effective, reasonable
quality translation that makes use of simple and
inexpensive human computations by monolin-
gual speakers in combination with machine
translation. The key insight behind the process
is that it is possible to spot likely translation
errors with only monolingual knowledge of the
target language, and it is possible to generate al-
ternative ways to say the same thing (i.e. para-
phrases) with only monolingual knowledge
of the source language. Evaluations demon-
strate that this approach can yield substantial
improvements in translation quality.
1 Introduction
For most of the world?s languages, the availability of
translation is limited to two possibilities: high qual-
ity at high cost, via professional translators, and low
quality at low cost, via machine translation (MT). The
spectrum between these two extremes is very poorly
populated, and at any point on the spectrum the ready
availability of translation is limited to only a small
fraction of the world?s languages. There is, of course,
a long history of technological assistance to transla-
tors, improving cost effectiveness using translation
memory (Laurian, 1984; Bowker and Barlow, 2004)
or other interactive tools to assist translators (Esteban
et al, 2004; Khadivi et al, 2006). And there is a
recent and rapidly growing interest in crowdsourc-
ing with non-professional translators, which can be
remarkably effective (Munro, 2010). However, all
these alternatives face a central availability bottle-
neck: they require the participation of humans with
bilingual expertise.
In this paper, we report on a new exploration of
the middle ground, taking advantage of a virtually
unutilized resource: speakers of the source and tar-
get language who are effectively monolingual, i.e.
who each only know one of the two languages rel-
evant for the translation task. The solution we are
proposing has the potential to provide a more cost
effective approach to translation in scenarios where
machine translation would be considered acceptable
to use, if only it were generally of high enough qual-
ity. This would clearly exclude tasks like transla-
tion of medical reports, business contracts, or literary
works, where the validation of a qualified bilingual
translator is absolutely necessary. However, it does
include a great many real-world scenarios, such as
following news reports in another country, reading in-
ternational comments about a product, or generating
a decent first draft translation of a Wikipedia page
for Wikipedia editors to improve.
The use of monolingual participants in a human-
machine translation process is not entirely new.
Callison-Burch et al (2004) pioneered the explo-
ration of monolingual post-editing within the MT
community, an approach extended more recently to
provide richer information to the user by Albrecht et
al. (2009) and Koehn (2009). There have also been at
least two independently developed human-machine
translation frameworks that employ an iterative pro-
tocol involving monolinguals on both the source and
target side. Morita and Ishida (2009) describe a sys-
tem in which target and source language speakers
perform editing of MT output to improve fluency
and adequacy, respectively; they utilize source-side
paraphrasing at a course grain level, although their ap-
proach is limited to requests to paraphrase the entire
sentence when the translation cannot be understood.
127
Bederson et al (2010) describe a similar protocol in
which cross-language communication is enhanced by
metalinguistic communication in the user interface.
Shahaf and Horvitz (2010) use machine translation
as a specific instance of a general game-based frame-
work for combining a range of machine and human
capabilities.
We call the technique used here targeted para-
phrasing. In a nutshell, target-language monolin-
guals identify parts of an initial machine translation
that don?t appear to be right, and source-language
monolinguals provide the MT system with alterna-
tive phrasings that might lead to better translations;
these are then passed through MT again and the best
scoring hypothesis is selected as the final translation.
This technique can be viewed as compatible with
the richer protocol- and game-based approaches, but
it is considerably simpler; in Sections 2 through 4
we describe the method and present evaluation re-
sults on Chinese-English translation. Unlike other
approaches, the technique also offers clear opportu-
nities to replace human participation with machine
components if the latter are up to the task; we discuss
this in Section 5 before wrapping up in Section 6
with conclusions and directions for future work.
2 Targeted Paraphrasing
The starting point for our approach is an observa-
tion: the source sentence provided as input to an MT
system is just one of many ways in which the mean-
ing could have been expressed, and for any given
MT system, some forms of expression are easier to
translate than others. The same basic observation
has been applied quite fruitfully over the past several
years to deal with statistical MT challenges involv-
ing segmentation, morphological analysis, and more
recently, source language word order (Dyer, 2007;
Dyer et al, 2008; Dyer and Resnik, 2010). Here we
apply it to the surface expression of meaning.
For example, consider the following real example
of translation from English to French by an automatic
MT system:
? Source: Polls indicate Brown, a state senator,
and Coakley, Massachusetts? Attorney General,
are locked in a virtual tie to fill the late Sen. Ted
Kennedy?s Senate seat.
? System: Les sondages indiquent Brown,
un se?nateur d?e?tat, et Coakley,
Massachusetts? Procureur ge?ne?ral, sont en-
ferme?s dans une cravate virtuel a` remplir le
regrette? se?nateur Ted Kennedy?s sie`ge au Se?nat.
A French speaker can look at this automatic transla-
tion and see immediately that the underlined parts
are wrong, even without knowing the intended source
meaning. We can identify the spans in the source En-
glish sentence that are responsible for these badly
translated French spans, and change them to alterna-
tive expressions with the same meaning (e.g. chang-
ing Massachusetts? Attorney General to the Attorney
General of Massachusetts); if we do so and then use
the same MT system again, we obtain a translation
that is still imperfect (e.g. cravate means necktie),
but is more acceptable:
? System: Les sondages indiquent que Brown, un
se?nateur d?e?tat, et Coakley, le procureur ge?ne?ral
du Massachusetts, sont enferme?s dans une cra-
vate virtuel pourvoir le sie?ge au Se?nat de Sen.
Ted Kennedy, qui est de?ce?de? re?cemment.
Operationally, then, translation with targeted para-
phrasing includes the following steps.
Initial machine translation. For this paper, we
use the Google Translate Research API, which,
among other advantages, provides word-level align-
ments between the source text and its output. In
principle, however, any automatic translation system
can be used in this role, potentially at some cost
to quality, by performing post hoc target-to-source
alignment.
Identification of mistranslated spans. This step
identifies parts of the source sentence that lead to
ungrammatical, nonsensical, or apparently incorrect
translations on the target side. In the experiments
of Sections 3 and 4, this step is performed by hav-
ing monolingual target speakers identify likely error
spans on the target side, as in the French example
above, and projecting those spans back to the source
spans that generated them using word alignments
as the bridge (Hwa et al, 2005; Yarowsky et al,
2001). In Section 5, we describe a heuristic but effec-
tive method for performing this fully automatically.
Du et al (2010), in this proceedings, explore the
128
use of source paraphrases without targeting appar-
ent mistranslations, using lattice translation (Dyer
et al, 2008) to efficiently represent and decode the
resulting very large space of paraphrase alternatives.
Source paraphrase generation. This step gener-
ates alternative expressions for the source spans iden-
tified in the previous step. In this paper, it is per-
formed by monolingual source speakers who perform
the paraphrase task: the speaker is given a sentence
with a phrase span marked, and is asked to replace the
marked text with a different way of saying the same
thing, so that the resulting sentence still makes sense
and means the same thing as the original sentence.
To illustrate in English, someone seeing John and
Mary took a European vacation this summer might
supply the paraphrase Mary went on a European, ver-
ifying that the resulting John and Mary went on a
European vacation this summer preserves the origi-
nal meaning. This step can also be fully automated
(Max, 2009) by taking advantage of bilingual phrase-
table pivoting (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005);
see Max (2010), in these proceedings, for a related
approach in which the paraphrases of a source phrase
are used to refine the estimated probability distribu-
tion over its possible target phrases.
Generating sentential source paraphrases. For
each sentence, there may be multiple paraphrased
spans. These are multiplied out to provide full-
sentence paraphrases. For example, if two non-
overlapping source spans are each paraphrased in
three ways, we generate 9 sentential source para-
phrases, each of which represents an alternative way
of expressing the original sentence.
Machine translation of alternative sentences.
The alternative source sentences, produced via para-
phrase, are sent through the same MT system, and
a single-best translation hypothesis is selected, e.g.
on the basis of the translation system?s model score.
In principle, one could also combine the alternatives
into a lattice representation and decode to find the
best path using lattice translation (Dyer et al, 2008);
cf. Du et al (2010). One could also present trans-
lation alternatives to a target speaker for selection,
similarly to Callison-Burch et al (2004).
Notice that with the exception of the initial trans-
lation, each remaining step in this pipeline can in-
volve either human participation or fully automatic
processing. The targeted paraphrasing framework
therefore defines a rich set of intermediate points on
the spectrum between fully automatic and fully hu-
man translation, of which we explore only a few in
this paper.
3 Pilot Study
In order to assess the potential of our approach,
we conducted a small pilot study, using eleven
sentences in simplified Chinese selected from
the article on ?Water? in Chinese Wikipedia
(http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%B0%B4). This
article was chosen because its topic is well known
in both English-speaking and Chinese-speaking pop-
ulations. The first five sentences were taken from
the first paragraph of the article. The other six sen-
tences were taken from a randomly-chosen paragraph
in the article. As a preprocessing step, we removed
any parenthetical items from the input sentences, e.g.
?(H20)?. The shortest sentence in this set has 12 Chi-
nese characters, the longest has 54.1
Human participation in this task was accomplished
using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online market-
place that enables human performance of small ?hu-
man intelligence tasks? (HITs) in return for micropay-
ments. For each sentence, after we translated it au-
tomatically (using Google Translate), three English-
speaking Mechanical Turk workers (?Turkers?) on
the target side performed identification of mistrans-
lated spans. Each span identified was projected back
to its corresponding source span, and three Chinese-
speaking Turkers were asked to provide paraphrases
of each source span. These tasks were easy to per-
form (no more than around 30 seconds to complete
on average) and inexpensive (less than $1 for the
entire pilot study).2 The Chinese source span para-
phrases were then used to construct full-sentence
paraphrases, which were retranslated, once again by
Google Translate, to produce the output of the tar-
geted paraphrasing translation process.
1Note that this page is not a translation of the corresponding
English Wikipedia page or vice versa.
2The four English-speaking Turkers were recruited through
the normal Mechanical Turk mechanism. The three Chinese-
speaking Turkers were recruited offline by the authors in order to
quickly obtain results, although they participated as full-fledged
Turkers.
129
The initial translation outputs from Google Trans-
late (GT) and the results of the targeted paraphrasing
translation process (TP) were evaluated according
to widely used critera of fluency and adequacy. Flu-
ency ratings were obtained on a 5-point scale from
three native English speakers without knowledge of
Chinese. Translation adequacy ratings were obtained
from three native Chinese speakers who are also flu-
ent in English; they assessed adequacy of English
sentences by comparing the communicated meaning
to the Chinese source sentences.
Fluency was rated on the following scale:
1. Unintelligible: nothing or almost nothing of the sen-
tence is comprehensible.
2. Barely intelligible: only a part of the sentence (less
than 50%) is understandable.
3. Fairly intelligible: the major part of the sentence
passes.
4. Intelligible: all the content of the sentence is com-
prehensible, but there are errors of style and/or of
spelling, or certain words are missing.
5. Very intelligible: all the content of the sentence is
comprehensible. There are no mistakes.
Adequacy was rated on the following scale:
1. None of the meaning expressed in the reference sen-
tence is expressed in the sentence.
2. Little of the reference sentence meaning is expressed
in the sentence.
3. Much of the reference sentence meaning is expressed
in the sentence.
4. Most of the reference sentence meaning is expressed
in the sentence.
5. All meaning expressed in the reference sentence ap-
pears in the sentence.
For each GT output, we averaged across the ratings
of the alternative TP to produce average TP fluency
and adequacy scores. The average GT output rat-
ings, measuring the pure machine translation base-
line, were 2.36 for fluency and 2.91 for adequacy.
Averaging across the TP outputs, these rose to 3.32
and 3.49, respectively.
One could argue that a more sensible evaluation
is not to average across alternative TP outputs, but
rather to simulate the behavior of a target-language
speaker who simply chooses the one translation
among the alternatives that seems most fluent. If
we select the most fluent TP output for each source
sentence according to the English-speakers? average
fluency ratings, we obtain average test set ratings of
3.58 for fluency and 3.73 for adequacy. Those are
respective gains of 0.82 and 1.21 over the baseline
initial MT output, each on a 5-point scale.
Figure 1 shows a selection of outputs: we present
the two cases where the most fluent TP alternative
shows the greatest gain in average fluency rating (best
gain +2.67); two cases near the median gain in av-
erage fluency (median +1); and the worst two cases
with respect to effect on average fluency rating (worst
-0.33). The table accurately conveys a qualitative im-
pression corresponding to the quantitative results: the
overall quality of translations appears to be improved
by our process consistently, despite the absence of
any bilingual input in the improvements.
4 Chinese-English Evaluation
As a followup to our pilot study, we conducted an
evaluation using Chinese-English test data taken from
the NIST MT?08 machine translation evaluation, in
order to obtain fully automatic translation evaluation
scores. We report on results for 49 sentences of the
1,357 in this data set. These underwent the same
targeted paraphrasing process as in the pilot study,
with the addition of a basic step to filter out cheaters:
we disregarded as invalid any responses consisting
purely of ASCII characters (signifying a non-Chinese
response) or responses that were identical to the orig-
inal source text.
Target English speakers identified 115 potential
mistranslation spans, or 2.3 spans per sentence, that
yielded at least one source paraphrase on the source
Chinese side. Chinese speakers provided 138 valid
paraphrases. The entire cost for the human tasks in
this experiment was $5.06, or a bit under $0.11 per
sentence on average.3
Table 1 reports on the results, evaluating in stan-
dard fashion using BLEU with the four English
MT?08 references for each Chinese sentence. Since
the targeted paraphrasing translation process (TP)
produces multiple hypotheses ? one automatic trans-
lation output per sentential paraphrases ? we se-
lected the single best output for each sentence by
3Invalid paraphrase responses were rejected, i.e. zero-cost.

MT?08 Chinese-English test set
selecting the highest scoring English translation, ac-
cording to the translation score delivered with each
output by the Google Translate Research API. (The
original translation was, of course, included among
the candidates for selection.) This yielded an im-
provement of 1.68 BLEU points on the 49-sentence
test set (TP one-best).
One could argue that this result is simply a result of
having more hypotheses to choose from, not a result
of the targeted paraphrasing process itself. In order
to rule out this possibility, we generated (n+ 1)-best
Google translations, setting n for each sentence to
match the number of alternative translations gener-
ated via targeted paraphrasing. We then chose the
best translation for each sentence, among the (n+1)-
best Google hypotheses, via oracle selection, using
the TERp metric (Snover et al, 2009) to evaluate
each hypothesis against the reference translations.4
The resulting BLEU score for the full set showed
negligible improvement (GT n-best oracle).
We did a similar oracle-best calculation using
TERp for targeted paraphrasing (TP oracle). The
result shows a potential gain of 2.46 BLEU points
over the baseline, if the best scoring alternative from
the targeted paraphrasing process were always cho-
sen.
In addition to aggregate scoring using BLEU, we
also looked at oracle results on a per-sentence ba-
sis using TERp (since BLEU more appropriate to
use at the document level, not the sentence level).
Identifying the best sentential paraphrase alternative
using TERp as an oracle, we find that the TERp
score would improve for 32 of the 49 test sentences,
4An ?oracle? telling us which variant is best is not available
in the real world, of course, but in situations like this one, oracle
studies are often used to establish the magnitude of the potential
gain (Och et al, 2004).
65.3%. For those 32 sentences, the average gain is
8.36 TERp points.5 A fairer measure is the average
obtained when scoring zero gain for the 17 sentences
where no improvement was obtained; taking these
into account, i.e. assuming an oracle who chooses the
original translation if none of the paraphrase-based
alternatives are better, the average improvement over
the entire set of 49 sentences is 5.46 TERp points.
Although we have obtained results on only a small
subset of the full NIST MT?08 test set, our automatic
evaluation confirms the qualitative impressions in
Figure 1 and the subjective ratings results obtained
in our pilot study in Section 3. The TP oracle results
establish that by taking advantage of monolingual
human speakers, it is possible to obtain quite sub-
stantial gains in translation quality. The TP one-best
results demonstrate that the majority of that oracle
gain is obtained in automatic hypothesis selection,
simply by selecting the paraphrase-based alternative
translation with the highest translation score.
The last line in Table 1 shows a human upper
bound computed using the reference translations via
cross validation; that is, for each of the four reference
translations, we evaluate it as a hypothesized transla-
tion using the other three references as ground truth;
these four scores were then averaged. The value of
this upper bound is quite consistent with the bound
computed similarly by Callison-Burch (2009).
5 English-Chinese Evaluation
As we noted in Section 2, the targeted paraphrasing
translation process defines a set of human-machine
combinations that do not require bilingual expertise.
The previous section described human identification
of mistranslated spans on the target side, human gen-
eration of paraphrases for problematic sub-sentential
spans on the source side, and both automatic hypothe-
sis selection and human selection (via fluency ratings,
in Section 3).
In this section, we take a step toward more au-
tomated processing, replacing human identification
of mistranslated spans with an a fully automatic
method.6 The idea behind our automatic error iden-
tification is straightforward: if the source sentence
5?Gains? refer to a lower score: since TERp is an error
measure, lower is better.

Buzek et al (2010).

is translated to the target and then back-translated, a
comparison of the result with the original is likely to
identify places where the translation process encoun-
tered difficulty.7 Briefly, we automatically translate
source F to target E, then back-translate to produce F?
in the source language. We compare F and F? using
TERp ? which, in addition to its use as an evaluation
metric, is a form of string-edit distance that identifies
various categories of differences between two sen-
tences. When at least two consecutive edits are found,
we flag their smallest containing syntactic constituent
as a potential source of translation difficulty.8
In more detail, we posit that if an area of backtrans-
lation F? has many edits relative to original sentence
F, then that area probably comes from parts of the
target translation that did not represent the desired
meaning in F very well. We only consider consec-
utive edits in certain of the TERp edit categories,
specifically, deletions (D), insertions (I), and shifts
(S); the two remaining categories, matches (M) and
paraphrases (P), indicate that the words are identical
or that the original meaning was preserved. Further-
more, we assume that while a single D, S, or I edit
might be fairly meaningless, a string of at least two of
those types of edits is likely to represent a substantive
problem in the translation.
In order to identify reasonably meaningful para-
phrase units based on potential errors, we rely on a
source language constituency parser. Using the parse,
we find the smallest constituent of the sentence con-
taining all of the tokens in a particular error string. At
times, these constituents can be quite large, even the
entire sentence. To weed out these cases, we restrict
constituent length to no more than 7 tokens.
For example, given

Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft in late Febru-

7Exactly the same insight is behind the ?source-side pseudo-
referencebased feature? employed by Soricut and Echihabi
(2010) in their system for predicting the trustworthiness of trans-
lations.
8It is possible that the difficulty so identified involves back-
translation only, not translation in the original direction. If that
is the case, then more paraphrasing will be done than necessary,
but the quality of the TP process?s output should not suffer.

spans in the the bolded phrase in F would be iden-
tified, based on the TERp alignment and smallest
containing constituent as shown in Figure 3.
In order to evaluate this approach, we again use
NIST MT08 data, this time going in the English-
to-Chinese direction since we are assuming source
language resources not currently available for Chi-
nese.9 We used English reference 0 as the source
sentence, and the original Chinese sentence as the
target.10
The data set comprises 1,357 sentence pairs. Us-
ing the above described algorithm to automatically
identify possible problem areas in the translation,
with the Google Translate API providing both the
translation and back-translation, we generated 1,780
potential error spans in 1,006 of the sentences, and,
continuing the targeted paraphrasing process, we ob-
tained up to three source paraphrases per span, for
the problemantic spans in 1,000 of those sentences.
(For six sentences, no paraphrases weres suggested
for any of the problematic spans.) These yielded
full-sentence paraphrase alternatives for the 1,000
sentences, which we again evaluated via an oracle
study.
For this study we used the TER metric (Snover
et al, 2006) rather than TERp. Comparing with the
GT output, we find that TP yields a better-translated
paraphrase sentence is available in 313 of the 1000
cases, or 31.3%, and for those 313 cases, TER for the
oracle-best paraphrase alternative improves on the
TER for the original sentence by 12.16 TER points.
Also taking into account the cases where there is
no improvement over the baseline, the average TER
score improves by 3.8 points. The cost for human
tasks in this study ? just paraphrases, since identi-
fying problematic spans was done automatically ?
was $117.48, or a bit under $0.12 per sentence.
9The Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2002), which
we use to identify source syntactic constituents, exists for both
English and Chinese, but TERp uses English resources such as
WordNet in order to capture acceptable variants of expression
for the same meaning. Matt Snover (personal communication) is
working on extension of TERp to other languages.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we have focused on a relatively less-
explored space on the spectrum between high quality
and low cost translation: sharing the burden of the
translation task among a fully automatic system and
monolingual human participants, without requiring
human bilingual expertise. The monolingual par-
ticipants in this framework perform straightforward
tasks: they identify parts of sentences in their lan-
guage that seem to have errors, they provide sub-
sentential paraphrases in context, and they judge the
fluency of sentences they are presented with (or, in a
variant still to be explored, they simply select which
target sentence they like the best). Unlike other pro-
posals for exploiting monolingual speakers in human-
machine collaborative translation, the human steps
here are amenable to automation, and in addition
to evaluating a mostly-human variant of our targeted
paraphrasing translation framework, we also assessed
a version in which the identification of mistranslated
spans (to be paraphrased) is done automatically.
Our experimentation yielded a consistent pattern
of results, supporting the conclusion that targeted
paraphrasing can lead to significant improvements
in translation, via several different measures. First,
a very small pilot study for Chinese-English trans-
lation in Wikipedia provided preliminary validation
that translation fluency and accuracy can be improved
quite significantly for a set of fairly chosen test sen-
tences, according to human ratings. Second, a small
experiment in Chinese-English translation using stan-
dard NIST test sentences suggested the potential for
dramatic gains using the BLEU and TERp scores,
with oracle improvements of 2.46 points and 5.46
points, respectively. In addition, a non-oracle experi-
ment, selecting the best hypothesis according to the
MT system?s model score, yielded a gain of nearly 1.7
BLEU points. And third, in a large scale evaluation
of the approach using English-Chinese translation
of 1,000 sentences, this time automating the step of
identifying potentially mistranslated parts of source
sentences, the oracle results demonstrated that a gain
of nearly 4 TER points is available.
These initial studies leave considerable room for
future work. One important step will be to better char-
acterize the relationship between cost and quality in
quantitative terms: how much does it cost to obtain
135
how much quality improvement, and how does that
compare with typical professional translation costs of
$0.25 per word? This question is closely connected
with the dynamics of crowdsourcing platforms such
as Mechanical Turk ? the cost per sentence in these
experiments works out to be around $0.12, but trans-
lation on a large scale will involve a complicated
ecosystem of workers and cheaters, tasks and motiva-
tions and incentives (Quinn and Bederson, 2009). A
related crowdsourcing issue requiring further study
is the availability of monolingual human participants
for a range of language pairs, in order to validate
the argument that drawing on monolingual human
participation will significantly reduce the severity of
the availability bottleneck. And, of course, in the
upper bound in Table 1 makes quite clear the cru-
cial value added by bilingual translators, when they
are available; we hope to explore whether the tar-
geted paraphrasing translation pipeline can improve
the productivity of post-editing by bilinguals, mak-
ing it easier to move toward the upper bound in a
cost-effective way.
Another set of issues concerns the underlying trans-
lation technology. A reviewer correctly notes that the
value of the approach taken here is likely to vary
depending upon the quality of the underlying trans-
lation system, and the approach may break down at
the extrema, when the baseline translation is either
already very good or completely awful. We chose
to use Google Translate for its wide availability and
the fact that it represents a state of the art baseline to
beat; however, in future work we plan to substitute
our own statistical MT systems, which will permit us
to experiment across a range of translation model and
language model LM training set sizes, and therefore
to vary quality while keeping other system details
constant. More directly connected to research in ma-
chine translation, this framework provides a variety
of opportunities for improving fully automatic sta-
tistical MT systems. We plan to implement a fully
automatic targeted paraphrasing translation pipeline,
using the automated methods discussed when intro-
ducing the pipeline in Section 2, including transla-
tion of targeted paraphrase lattices (cf. (Max, 2010;
Du et al, 2010)). Finally, we intend to explore the
application of our approach in scenarios involving
less-common languages, by using a more common
language as a pivot or bridge (Habash and Hu, 2009).
