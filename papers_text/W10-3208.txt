Abstract 
The discipline where sentiment/ opi-
nion/ emotion has been identified and 
classified in human written text is well 
known as sentiment analysis. A typical 
computational approach to sentiment 
analysis starts with prior polarity lex-
icons where entries are tagged with 
their prior out of context polarity as 
human beings perceive using their 
cognitive knowledge. Till date, all re-
search efforts found in sentiment lex-
icon literature deal mostly with English 
texts. In this article, we propose mul-
tiple computational techniques like, 
WordNet based, dictionary based, cor-
pus based or generative approaches for 
generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian 
languages. Currently, SentiWordNet(s) 
are being developed for three Indian 
languages: Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. 
An online intuitive game has been de-
veloped to create and validate the de-
veloped SentiWordNet(s) by involving 
Internet population. A number of au-
tomatic, semi-automatic and manual 
validations and evaluation methodolo-
gies have been adopted to measure the 
coverage and credibility of the devel-
oped SentiWordNet(s). 
1 Introduction 
Sentiment analysis and classification from 
electronic text is a hard semantic disambigua-
tion problem. The regulating aspects of seman-
tic orientation of a text are natural language 
context information (Pang et al, 2002) lan-
guage properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), 
domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Ga-
mon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the 
time dimension (Read, 2005). 
The following example shows that the polar-
ity tag associated with a sentiment word de-
pends on the time dimension. During 90?s mo-
bile phone users generally reported in various 
online reviews about their color phones but in 
recent times color phone is not just enough. 
People are fascinated and influenced by touch 
screen and various software(s) installation fa-
cilities on these new generation gadgets. 
In typical computational approaches (Higa-
shinaka et al, 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al, 
2000) to sentiment analysis researchers con-
sider the problem of learning a dictionary that 
maps semantic representations to verbaliza-
tions, where the data comes from opinionated 
electronic text. Although lexicons in these dic-
tionaries are not explicitly marked up with re-
spect to their contextual semantics, they con-
tain only explicit polarity rating and aspect 
indicators. Lexicon-based approaches can be 
broadly classified into two categories firstly 
where the discriminative polarity tag of lex-
icons is determined on labeled training data 
and secondly where the lexicons are manually 
compiled, the later constitutes the main effec-
tive approach.  
It is undoubted that the manual compilation 
is always the best way to create monolingual 
semantic lexicons, but manual methods are 
expensive in terms of human resources, it in-
volves a substantial number of human annota-
tors and it takes lot of time as well. In this pa-
per we propose several computational tech-
niques to generate sentiment lexicons in Indian 
languages automatically and semi-
automatically. In the present task, SentiWord-
56
Net(s) are being developed for the Bengali, 
Hindi and Telugu languages.  
Several prior polarity sentiment lexicons are 
available for English such as SentiWordNet 
(Esuli et. al., 2006), Subjectivity Word List 
(Wilson et. al., 2005), WordNet Affect list 
(Strapparava et al, 2004), Taboada?s adjective 
list (Taboada et al, 2006).  
Among these publicly available sentiment 
lexicon resources we find that SentiWordNet is 
most widely used (number of citation is higher 
than other resources1) in several applications 
such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and 
emotion analysis. Subjectivity Word List is 
most trustable as the opinion mining system 
OpinionFinder2 that uses the subjectivity word 
list has reported highest score for opi-
nion/sentiment subjectivity (Wiebe and Riloff, 
2006). SentiWordNet is an automatically con-
structed lexical resource for English that as-
signs a positivity score and a negativity score 
to each WordNet synset.  
The subjectivity word list is compiled from 
manually developed resources augmented with 
entries learned from corpora. The entries in the 
subjectivity word list have been labeled with 
part of speech (POS) tags as well as either 
strong or weak subjective tag depending on the 
reliability of the subjective nature of the entry.  
These two resources have been merged au-
tomatically and the merged resource is used for 
SentiWordNet(s) generation in the present 
task.  
The generated sentiment lexicons or Senti-
WordNet(s) for several Indian languages most-
ly contain synsets (approximately 60%) of re-
spective languages. Synset based method is 
robust for any kind of monolingual lexicon 
creation and useful to avoid further word sense 
disambiguation problem in application domain.  
Additionally we have developed an online 
intuitive game to create and validate the devel-
oped SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internet 
population.  
The proposed approaches in this paper are 
easy to adopt for any new language. To meas-
ure the coverage and credibility of generated 
SentiWordNet(s) in Indian languages we have

developed several automatic and semi-
automatic evaluation methods. 
2 Related Works 
Various methods have been used in the litera-
ture such as WordNet based, dictionary based, 
corpus based or generative approaches for sen-
timent lexicon generation in a new target lan-
guage.  
Andreevskaia and Bergler, (2006) present a 
method for extracting sentiment-bearing adjec-
tives from WordNet using the Sentiment Tag 
Extraction Program (STEP). They did 58 
STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed 
lists drawn from manually annotated list of 
positive and negative adjectives and evaluated 
the results against other manually annotated 
lists.  
The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff, 
2006) automatically generate resources for 
subjectivity analysis for a new target language 
from the available resources for English. Two 
techniques have been proposed for the genera-
tion of target language lexicon from English 
subjectivity lexicon. The first technique uses a 
bilingual dictionary while the second method 
is a parallel corpus based approach using exist-
ing subjectivity analysis tools for English. 
Automatically or manually created lexicons 
may have limited coverage and do not include 
most semantically contrasting word pairs like 
antonyms. Antonyms are broadly categorized 
(Saif Mohammed, 2008) as gradable adjec-
tives (hot?cold, good?bad, friend?enemy) and 
productive adjectives (normal?abnormal, for-
tune?misfortune, implicit?explicit). The first 
type contains the semantically contrasting 
word pairs but the second type includes ortho-
graphic suffix/affix as a clue. The second type 
is highly productive using very less number of 
affixation rules.  
Degree of antonymy (Mohammad et al, 
2008) is defined to encompass the complete 
semantic range as a combined measure of the 
contrast in meaning conveyed by two antony-
my words and is identified by distributional 
hypothesis. It helps to measure relative senti-
ment score of a word and its antonym.   
Kumaran et al, (2008) introduced a beauti-
ful method for automatic data creation by on-
line intuitive games. A methodology has been 
57
proposed for community creation of linguistic 
data by community collaborative framework 
known as wikiBABEL3. It may be described as 
a revolutionary approach to automatically 
create large credible linguistic data by involv-
ing Internet population for content creation.  
For the present task we prefer to involve all 
the available methodologies to automatically 
and semi-automatically create and validate 
SentiWordNet(s) for three Indian languages. 
Automatic methods involve only computation-
al methods. Semi-automatic methods involve 
human interruption to validate system?s output. 
3 Source Lexicon Acquisition  
SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List 
have been identified as the most reliable source 
lexicons. The first one is widely used and the 
second one is robust in terms of performance. 
A merged sentiment lexicon has been devel-
oped from both the resources by removing the 
duplicates. It has been observed that 64% of 
the single word entries are common in the Sub-
jectivity Word List and SentiWordNet. The 
new merged sentiment lexicon consists of 
14,135 numbers of tokens. Several filtering 
techniques have been applied to generate the 
new list. 
A subset of 8,427 sentiment words has been 
extracted from the English SentiWordNet, by 
selecting those whose orientation strength is 
above the heuristically identified threshold 
value of 0.4. The words whose orientation 
strength is below 0.4 are ambiguous and may 
lose their subjectivity in the target language 
after translation. A total of weakly subjective 
2652 words are discarded from the 
Subjectivity word list as proposed in (Wiebe 
and Riloff, 2006). 
In the next stage the words whose POS 
category in the Subjectivity word list is 
undefined and tagged as ?anypos? are 
considered. These words may generate sense 
ambiguity issues in the next stages of 
subjectivity detection. The words are checked 
in the SentiWordNet list for validation. If a 
match is found with certain POS category, the 
word is added to the new merged sentiment

 http://research.microsoft.com/en-
us/projects/wikibabel/ 
lexicon. Otherwise the word is discarded to 
avoid ambiguities later. 
Some words in the Subjectivity word list are 
inflected e.g., memories. These words would 
be stemmed during the translation process, but 
some words present no subjectivity property 
after stemming (memory has no subjectivity 
property). A word may occur in the 
subjectivity list in many inflected forms. 
Individual clusters for the words sharing the 
same root form are created and then checked in 
the SentiWordNet for validation. If the root 
word exists in the SentiWordNet then it is 
assumed that the word remains subjective after 
stemming and hence is added to the new list. 
Otherwise the cluster is completely discarded 
to avoid any further ambiguities. 
Various statistics of the English Senti-
WordNet and Subjectivity Word List are re-
ported in Table 1.

4 Target Lexicon Generation 
4.1 Bilingual Dictionary Based Approach 
A word-level translation process followed by 
error reduction technique has been adopted for 
generating the Indian languages 
SentiWordNet(s) from the English sentiment 
lexicon merged from the English 
SentiWordNet and the Subjectivity Word List.  
English to Indian languages synsets are be-
ing developed under Project English to Indian 
Languages Machine Translation Systems 
58
(EILMT)4, a consortia project funded by De-
partment of Information Technology (DIT), 
Government of India. These synsets are robust 
and reliable as these are created by native 
speakers as well as linguistics experts of the 
specific languages. For each language we have 
approximately 9966 synsets along with the 
English WordNet offset. These bilingual syn-
set dictionaries have been used along with lan-
guage specific dictionaries. 
A word level synset/lexical transfer tech-
nique is applied to each English synset/word in 
the merged sentiment lexicon. Each dictionary 
search produces a set of Indian languages syn-
sets/words for a particular English synset/word.  
4.1.1 Hindi 
Two available manually compiled English-
Hindi electronic dictionaries have been identi-
fied for the present task. First is the SHABD-
KOSH5  and the second one is Shabdanjali6 .  
These two dictionaries have been merged au-
tomatically by replacing the duplicates. The 
merged English-Hindi dictionary contains ap-
proximately 90,872 unique entries. The posi-
tive and negative sentiment scores for the Hin-
di words are copied from their English Senti-
WordNet.  
The bilingual dictionary based translation 
process has resulted 22,708 Hindi entries.  
4.1.2 Bengali 
An English-Bengali dictionary (approx-
imately 102119 entries) has been developed 
using the Samsad Bengali-English dictionary7. 
The positive and negative sentiment scores for 
the Bengali words are copied from their Eng-
lish SentiWordNet equivalents.  
The bilingual dictionary based translation 
process has resulted in 35,805 Bengali entries. 
A manual checking is done to identify the re-
liability of the words generated from automatic 
process. After manual checking only 1688

words are discarded i.e., the final list consists 
of 34,117 words.  
4.2 Telugu 
Charles Philip Brown English-Telugu Dictio-
nary 8 , Aksharamala 9  English-Telugu Dictio-
nary and English-Telugu Dictionary 10  devel-
oped by Language Technology Research Cen-
ter (LTRC), International Institute of Hydera-
bad (IITH) have been chosen for the present 
task. There is no WordNet publicly available 
for Telugu and the corpus (Section 4.5) we 
used is small in size. Dictionary based ap-
proach is the main process for Telugu Senti-
WordNet generation.  
These three dictionaries have been merged 
automatically by replacing the duplicates. The 
merged English-Telugu dictionary contains 
approximately 112310 unique entries. The pos-
itive and negative sentiment scores for the Te-
lugu words are copied from their English Sen-
tiWordNet equivalents. 
The dictionary based translation process has 
resulted in 30,889 Telugu entries, about 88% 
of final Telugu SentiWordNet synsets. An on-
line intuitive game has been proposed in Sec-
tion 4.6 to automatically validate the devel-
oped Telugu SentiWordNet by involving In-
ternet population.  
4.3 WordNet Based Approach 
WordNet(s) are available for Hindi11  (Jha et 
al., 2001) and Bengali12 (Robkop et al, 2010) 
but publicly unavailable for Telugu. 
A WordNet based lexicon expansion strate-
gy has been adopted to increase the coverage 
of the generated SentiWordNet(s) through the 
dictionary based approach. The present algo-
rithm starts with English SentiWordNet syn-
sets that is expanded using synonymy and an-
tonymy relations in the WordNet. For match-
ing synsets we keep the exact score as in the 
source synset in the English SentiWordNet.

where pS , nS  are the positivity and negativ-
ity score for the source language (i.e, English) 
and pT , nT  are the positivity and negativity 
score for target languages (i.e., Hindi and Ben-
gali) respectively. 
4.3.1 Hindi 
Hindi WordNet is a well structured and ma-
nually compiled resource and is being updated 
since last nine years. There is an available 
API13  for accessing the Hindi WordNet. Al-
most 60% of final SentiWordNet synsets in 
Hindi are generated by this method. 
4.3.2 Bengali 
The Bengali WordNet is being developed by 
the Asian WordNet (AWN) community. It on-
ly contains 1775 noun synsets as reported in 
(Robkop et al, 2010). A Web Service14  has 
been provided for accessing the Bengali 
WordNet. There are only a few number of 
noun synsets in the Bengali WordNet and other 
important POS category words for sentiment 
lexicon such as adjective, adverb and verb are 
absent. Only 5% new lexicon entries have been 
generated in this process.  
4.4 Antonym Generation 
Automatically or manually created lexicons 
have limited coverage and do not include most 
semantically contrasting word pairs. To over-
come the limitation and increase the coverage 
of the SentiWordNet(s) we present automatic 
antonymy generation technique followed by 
corpus validation to check orthographically 
generated antonym does really exist. Only 16 
hand crafted rules have been used as reported 
in Table 2. About 8% of Bengali, 7% of Hindi 
and 11% of Telugu SentiWordNet entries are 
generated in this process.

4.5 Corpus Based Approach 
Language/culture specific words such as those 
listed below are to be captured in the devel-
oped SentiWordNet(s). But sentiment lexicon 
generation techniques via cross-lingual projec-
tion are unable to capture these words. As ex-
ample:  
????? (Sahera: A marriage-
wear) 
 (Durgapujo: A festiv-
al of Bengal) 
To increase the coverage of the developed 
SentiWordNet(s) and to capture the lan-
guage/culture specific words an automatic cor-
pus based approach has been proposed. At this 
stage the developed SentiWordNet(s) for the 
three Indian languages have been used as a 
seed list. Language specific corpus is automat-
ically tagged with these seed words and we 
have a simple tagset as SWP (Sentiment Word 
Positive) and SWN (Sentiment Word Nega-
tive). Although we have both positivity and 
negativity scores for the words in the seed list 
but we prefer a word level tag as either posi-
tive or negative following the highest senti-
ment score. 
A Conditional Random Field (CRF15) based 
Machine Learning model is then trained with 
the seed list corpus along with multiple lin-
guistics features such as morpheme, parts-of-

speech, and chunk label. These linguistics fea-
tures have been extracted by the shallow pars-
ers16  for Indian languages. An n-gram (n=4) 
sequence labeling model has been used for the 
present task.  
The monolingual corpuses used have been 
developed under Project English to Indian 
Languages Machine Translation Systems 
(EILMT). Each corpus has approximately 10K 
of sentences. 
4.6 Gaming Methodology 
There are several motivations behind develop-
ing an intuitive game to automatically create 
multilingual SentiWordNet(s). The assigned 
polarity scores to each synset may vary in time 
dimension. Language specific polarity scores 
may vary and it should be authenticated by 
numbers of language specific annotators. 
In the history of Information Retrieval re-
search there is a milestone when ESP17 game 
(Ahn et al, 2004) innovate the concept of a 
game to automatically label images available 
in World Wide Web. Highly motivated by the 
historical research we proposed a intuitive 
game to create and validate SentiWordNet(s) 
for Indian languages by involving internet 
population.

trieved by Google Image API18) along with a

from SentiWordNet) is displayed to a player 
and he/she is then been asked to capture his 
immediate sentiment as extreme positive, posi-
tive, extreme negative, negative or neutral by 
pressing appropriate emoticon buttons. A snap 
of the game is shown in the Figure 1. The sen-
timent score is calculated by the different emo-
ticons based on the inputs from the different 
players and then is assigned the scale as fol-
lows: extreme positive (pos: 0.5, neg: 0.0), 
positive (pos: 0.25, neg: 0.0), neutral (pos: 0.0, 
neg: 0.0), negative (pos: 0.0, 0.25), extreme 
negative (pos: 0.0, neg: 0.5). 
The score of a particular player is calculated 
on the basis of pre-stored sentiment lexicon 
scores in the generated SentiWordNet(s).  
5 Evaluation 
Andera Esuli and Fabrizio Sebastiani (2006) 
have calculated the reliability of the sentiment 
scores attached to every synsets in the English 
SentiWordNet. They have tagged sentiment 
words in the English WordNet with positive 
and negative sentiment scores. In the present 
task, these sentiment scores from English 
WordNet have been directly copied to the In-
dian language SentiWordNet(s).  
Two extrinsic evaluation strategies have 
been adopted for the developed Bengali Sen-
tiWordNet based on the two main usages of 
the sentiment lexicon as subjectivity classifier 
and polarity identifier. The Hindi and Telugu 
SentiWordNet(s) have not completely been 
evaluated.

Table 3: Bengali Corpus Statistics 
We experimented with NEWS and BLOG 
corpora for subjectivity detection. Sentiment 
lexicons are generally domain independent but 
it provides a good baseline while working with 
sentiment analysis systems. The coverage of 
61
the developed Bengali SentiWordNet is eva-
luated by using it in a subjectivity classifier 
(Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009). The statistics 
of the NEWS and BLOG corpora is reported in 
Table 3. 
For comparison with the coverage of Eng-
lish SentiWordNet the same subjectivity clas-
sifier (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009) has 
been applied on Multi Perspective Question 
Answering (MPQA) (NEWS) and IMDB Mov-
ie review corpus along with English Senti-
WordNet. The result of the subjectivity clas-
sifier on both the corpus proves that the cover-
age of the Bengali SentiWordNet is reasonably 
good. The subjectivity word list used in the 
subjectivity classifier is developed from the 
IMDB corpus and hence the experiments on 
the IMDB corpus have yielded high precision 
and recall scores. The developed Bengali Sen-
tiWordNet is domain independent and still its 
coverage is very good as shown in Table 4.

5.2 Polarity Scores 
This evaluation metric measures the reliability 
of the associated polarity scores in the senti-
ment lexicons. To measure the reliability of 
polarity scores in the developed Bengali Sen-
tiWordNet, a polarity classifier (Das and Ban-
dyopadhyay, 2010) has been developed using 
the Bengali SentiWordNet alng with some 
other linguistic features.

SentiWordNet 47.60% 
Table 5: Polarity Performance Using Bengali 
SentiWordNet 
 
Feature ablation method proves that the as-
sociated polarity scores in the developed Ben-
gali SentiWordNet are reliable. Table 5 shows 
the performance of a polarity classifier using 
the Bengali SentiWordNet. The polarity wise 
overall performance of the polarity classifier is 
reported in Table 6. 
 
Polarity Precision Recall 
Positive 56.59% 52.89% 
Negative 75.57% 65.87% 
Table 6: Polarity-wise Performance Using 
Bengali SentiWordNet 
 
Comparative study with a polarity classifier 
that works with only prior polarity lexicon is 
necessary but no such works have been identi-
fied in literature.  
An arbitrary 100 words have been chosen 
from the Hindi SentiWordNet for human eval-
uation. Two persons are asked to manually 
check it and the result is reported in Table 7. 
The coverage of the Hindi SentiWordNet has 
not been evaluated, as no manually annotated 
sentiment corpus is available. 
 
Polarity Positive Negative 
Percentage 88.0% 91.0% 
Table 7: Evaluation of Polarity Score of De-
veloped Hindi SentiWordNet 
 
For Telugu we created a version of the game 
with Telugu words on screen. Only 3 users 
have played the Telugu language specific 
game till date. Total 92 arbitrary words have 
been tagged and the accuracy of the polarity 
scores is reported in Table 8. The coverage of 
Telugu SentiWordNet has not been evaluated, 
as no manually annotated sentiment corpus is 
available. 
Polarity Positive Negative

6 Conclusion 
SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages are be-
ing developed using various approaches. The 
game based technique may be directed towards 
a new way for the creation of linguistic data 
not just only for SentiWordNet(s) but in either
