ABSTRACT 1. INTRODUCTION 
We descr ibe  a fa i r l y  
comprehensive handl ing of the 
syntax  and  semant ics  of 
comparat ive constructions. The 
analysis is largely based on the 
theory developed by P inkham, 
but we advance arguments  to 
support  a different handl ing of 
phrasa l  comparat ives  - in 
par t i cu la r ,  we  use d i rec t  
in terpreta t ion  ins tead of C- 
ellipsis. We .explain the reasons 
for  d iv id ing  comparat ive  
sentences into different categories, 
and for each category we give an 
example of the corresponding 
Montague semantics. The ideas 
have all been imp lemented  
within a large-scale grammar for 
Swedish. 
This paper is written with two distinct 
audiences in mind. On the practical 
side, we try to present a cookbook 
which the natural language interface 
imp lementor  can ~use if he wishes to  
incorporate comparative constructions 
into his system's coverage. This is, we 
trust, interest ing in itself; a quick 
glance at Table 1 should be enough to 
show that this construction is more 
common than is perhaps general ly 
real ized. Thus in addi t ion to the 
obvious more, less and as much as, 
used together with an adjective, adverb 
or determiner, we also include such 
words as same, before and after, used 
in appropriate ways. We also try to 
give a usable classif ication of the 
var ious  k inds  of const ruct ions  
generally lumped together under the 
b lanket  head ing  of "Comparat ive 
Ellipsis". 
Examples of comparat ives  
1) John is taller than Mary. 
2) Few people run as fast as John. 
3) John bought more books than Mary. 
4) John was happier in New York than in London. 
5) John has more books than Mary has newspapers. 
6) John had this job before me. 
7) John was born in the same city as Mary. 
8) Mary had more friends than John thought. 
9) More men than women bought he book. 
10) Mary seems brighter than most of the pupils.

On the theoretical side, we want to 
reexamine  some fundamenta l  
questions concerning the nature of the 
comparat ive construction; we are 
going to argue that our practical work 
fairly strongly supports a hypothesis 
that has already appeared in several 
forms in the theoretical l iterature, 
namely that "comparative ellipsis" is a 
semantic rather than syntactic 
phenomenon. We expand more on 
this theme in section 2. In section 3 we 
present our handling of clausal 
comparison, which is a straightforward 
implementation f Pinkham's theory. 
The next two sections cover non- 
clausal comparison, and constitute the 
main part of the paper. In section 4 we 
show how Pinkham's predicate 
copying analysis can be implemented 
within a Montague grammar  
framework so that duplication of 
material is not syntactic copying of 
parts of the parse-tree but is instead a 
double application of a higher level 
function. We demonstrate at length 
how this method can be used to handle 
three different kinds of elliptic 
construction, all of which present 
problems for the syntactic approach. In 
section 5 we describe our treatment of 
the base generated phrasal 
constructions from section B.2.3 of 
Pinkham's thesis. (We call these 
"simple" phrasal comparatives). In the 
final section we summarize our 
results; in particular we  address 
ourselves to the question of justifying 
our classification of comparatives into 
separate categories instead of providing 
a unified interpretation. 
The current paper is a shortened 
version of (Rayner & Banks 88) ("the 
full paper"), which we will refer to 
from time to time. This includes 
among other things test examples and 
full program listings of a logic 
grammar based on the SNACK-85 
implementation, which covers all 
forms of comparison discussed here. 
2. PREVIOUS WORK 
The traditional viewpoint has been to 
explain non-clausal comparatives by 
means of deletion rules; the first 
detailed account based on this idea was 
(Bresnan 73), wh ich  s t rong ly  
influenced most work in the area 
during the following ten years. 
Recently, however, other researchers 
have pointed out problems with 
Bresnan's approach; a very thorough 
and detailed criticism appears in 
(Pinkham 85) 1, which has been our 
main theoretical source. Pinkham 
gives examples of a wide range of 
constructions which are difficult or 
impossible to explain in terms of 
deletion phenomena, and suggests 
instead an approach in which at least 
some comparative constructions are 
base-generated phrasal  and then 
interpreted using a rule which she calls 
"distributive copying". The following 
example  2 shows how the scheme 
works in practice. Sentence la) receives 
the logical form lb): 
la) I invited more men than women 
lb) I INVITED (MORE \[ql (ql men), q2 
(q2 women)\]) 
1 Hereafter "Pinkham". 
2 From Pinkharn, p. !23 
50 
(The object of INV ITED is the base 
generated phrasal). After distributive 
copying, this becomes lc): 
lc) MORE I ql (INVITED ql men), q2 
(INVITED q2 women)\] 
This manoevre,  replacing syntactic 
delet ion rules w i th  interpretat ive  
copying operations, seems to us very 
powerful, and (although we formulate 
it in a rather different way) is one of 
the central ideas in our own treatment 
of comparatives. We have in fact taken 
it even further than Pinkham, who 
keeps the verb deletion rule of "C- 
ellipsis" to explain some comparative 
constructions: in the account presented 
below in section 4, we get rid of the 
deletion rules completely and use only 
interpretative methods. 
In this context, it is interesting to look 
at Levin's LFG-based work on s lu idng 
const ruct ions  (Levin 82). Lev in  
presents a var iety of arguments to 
support her claim that sluicing is not a 
c-structure phenomenon (i.e. not 
e l l ipt ic  in nature) ,  but  ra ther  
explainable at f-structure level (i.e. in 
some sense related to a semant ic  
copying operation). The differences 
between s luic ing and comparat ive 
ellipsis are sufficiently great that this 
cannot in itself be said to prove 
anyth ing,  but  it is none the less 
ind icat ive  of the way in which  
l inguists are th ink ing about these 
problems. 
In SNACK-85, which uses a framework 
based on that in (Pereira 83), we 
perform copying operations on "quant- 
trees", a level of structure which can 
loosely be compared with Chomskian 
logical form or LFG's f-structures. 
Viewed in this light, we claim that our 
treatment of non-clausal comparison 
(which at first glance might  seem 
somewhat ad hoc) is in fact fairly weU- 
re lated to current  tendencies in 
theoretical linguistics. 
3. CLAUSAL COMPARATIVES 
Most authors are agreed that the case of 
clausal comParison is the simplest, and 
for this reason we tackle it first; despite 
this, it will be seen that there are a few 
tricky points. Our analysis is heavily 
based on P inkham's,  and virtual ly 
amounts to an implementation of the 
second section of her thesis; we start by 
summarizing what we see as the main 
ideas in her treatment. 
The fundamental  notion in Pinkham's 
analysis is to assume that there is an 
imp l i c i t  e lement  present  in a 
comparative clause, which is l inked to 
the head of the comparison 1 in a way 
similar to that in which a trace or gap 
is l inked to its controller. This "trace" 
a lways  contains a quant i f ier - l ike 
component. (We will adopt Pinkham's 
notation and symbolize this as Q). It 
may consist of just the Q on its own, or 
else be an implicit NP composed of the 
Q together with other material from 
the head of the comparison. 
P inkham argues that  there are 
essent ia l ly  three cases; these are 
exemplified in sentences 2a) - 2c). In 
the first of these, just the Q is 
extraposed; in the second, a Q together 
with the CN books, taken from the 
1 We endeavour throughout this paper to keep our 
terminology as close as possible to that used by 
Pinkham. The terms used are summarized in 
Appendix 1. 
51 
head more books. If the head contains 
a comparative adjective, as in 2c), then 
the extra material, consisting of the 
adjective and the main noun from the 
head, is obligatory. For a justification, 
and an explanation of several apparent 
exceptions, we refer to Pinkham, p. 33 - 
40. 
2a) John bought more books than 
Mary bought (Q) records. 
2b) John bought more books than 
Mary could carry (Q books). 
2c) John bought a more expensive 
vase than Mary bought (a Q 
expensive vase). 
A scheme of this kind can readily be 
implemented using any of the 
standard ways of handling traces. In 
our system, which is based on 
Extraposition Grammar (Pereira 83), 
we use the "extraposition list" to move 
the material from the head to the place 
in the comparative clause where it is 
going to appear; this corresponds to use 
of the HOLD register in an ATN, or 
"slash categories" in  a GPSG-like 
framework. 
Although this method appears to work 
well in practice, thre is a theoretical 
problem arising from the possibility of 
sentences with crossing extrapositions. 
We refer to the full paper for further 
discussion. 
4. DIRECT INTERPRETATION OF 
NON-CLAUSAL COMPARISON 
4.1 Basic ideas 
Our first implementation (Banks 86) 
was based on the conventional 
interpretation of comparatives: all 
comparatives are explicit or elliptic 
forms of clausal comparatives, making 
the analysis of comparison essentially a
syntactic process. In (Banks & Rayner 
87) we presented this in outline and 
then described some problems we had 
encountered, which eventually caused 
us to abandon the approach. Briefly, it 
turned out that the exact formulation 
of the syntactic opying process was by 
no means stra ightforward:  there 
appeared to be a strong parallel with 
the well-known arguments against he 
analogous point of view for co- 
ordination constructions. (See e.g. 
(Dowty et. al. 82), p. 271). As an 
example, we presented sentence 3) 
3) Everyone spent more money in 
London than in New York. 
which is problematic for a reduction 
account. We suggested instead that the 
sentence be  thought of as being 
composed of the fo l low ing  
components: the initial everyone, the 
contrasted elements London and New 
York, and the duplicated part, which 
could be rendered (roughly) as is a P 
such that P spent an amount of money 
in where _. In a Montague-  
grammar-like formalism, this can then 
be given the fol lowing semantic 
analysis: 
52 
"Montagovian" analysis of comparative 
(spent(x,y,z) is to be read as "x spent amount y in the city z") 
than in New York 
1. everyone 
2. New York 
3. London 
4. spent m in 
5. spent more in 
6. spent more in London than in New York 
everyone spent more in London than 
in New York

By':spent(x,y',New York)Ay>y' 
Vx: person(x)~ 
\[3y: spent(x,y, London)A 
3y': spent(x,y',New York)Ay>y'\] 
The key point is that the syntactic 
copying of the deletion approach has 
been replaced by a semantic operation, 
a double instantiation of a lambda- 
bound form. The following account 
summar izes  how the idea is 
implemented within the structure of 
the SNACK-85 system. 
Semantic interpretation in SNACK-85 
is performed by first converting the 
parse-tree to an intermediate form, 
which we call (following (Pereira 83)) a 
quant-tree. This is then subjected to 
rewriting rules before being converted 
into the final logical form. Normally, 
these rewriting rules formalize so- 
called scoping transformations; here, 
we will also use them to describe the 
in terpreta t ion  of non-c lausa l  
comparison. The basic motivation is 
the same, namely to remove rules 
from the grammar which lack syntactic 
motivation. 
We introduce four new kinds of nodes 
in addition to those defined in (Pereira 
83): we call these comparands ,  
comparative-objects, comparisons, and 
compar i son-p laceho lders .  They 
interact as follows. 
(Stage 1) At the syntactic level, we view 
the comparative object as a constituent 
in its associated comparative AP; when 
the parse-tree is transformed into the 
quant-tree, the AP gets turned into a 
comparand node, in which there is a 
comparat ive -ob jec t  subnode 
representing the comparative object. 
(Stage 2)Rewriting rules then move 
the comparat ive -ob jec t  out of the 
comparand,  leaving behind a 
placeholder. This is a triple consisting 
of the compared predicate (the 
adjective, adverb or whatever), and 
two logical variables (the "linking" 
variables), which correspond to the 
lambda-bound variables y and ~ above. 
(Stage 3) The "raised" comparat ive -  
object node is a 4-tuple. It consists of 
53 
? The two variables y and P (and is 
thus "linked" to the p laceholder  
through them- hence the name), 
? The comparison type (more than, 
less than, same as etc.) 
? The quant  subnode which 
represents the comparand NP or 
PP. 
The rewriting rules move it upwards 
until it finds a quant node that it can be 
compared against. At the moment, the 
only compatibil ity requirements are 
that the quant  node and the 
comparative-object 's quant subnode 
not have incompatible case-markings. 
This could be improved upon; one way 
would  be to def ine preference 
heuristics which gave higher priority 
to comparisons between quant nodes 
whose variables are of similar type. 
The result of merging the two nodes is 
a comparison ode, which is a 5-tuple 
consisting of 
? The comparative-object's quant 
node 
? The quant  node it has been 
merged with 
? The comparison type 
? The two "linking variables", y 
and P 
When the quant-tree is converted into 
logical form, there should thus be only 
comparison nodes and placeholder 
nodes left, with the placeholders 
"below" the comparisons. In the final 
stage, the portion of the quant-tree 
under  the compar ison node is 
dupl icated twice, and the l inking 
variables instantiated in each copy in 
the manner described above. So in the 
"inner" copy, P gets instantiated to a a 
form 2y:comp(y,y'), where comp is the 
type of comparison and y and y' are the 
degree variables; in the "outer" copy, P 
is instantiated to the value of the inner 
form. 
In the next two subsections, we go 
further to show how a similar analysis 
can be used to assign a correct 
semantics to two other kinds of 
comparative construction without any 
recourse to C-ellipsis. 
4.2. Comparatives with "s-operators" 
In this section, we are going to 
examine comparative constructions 
like those in 4a), 4b) and 4c). These 
have a long and honourable history in 
the semantics literature; 4c) is a famous 
example due to Russell. 
4a) Mary had more friends than John 
had expected. 
4b) Most people paid more than Mary 
sa/d. 
4c) John's yacht was longer than I 
thought. 
In order tohandle xamples like these 
within our framework, we need a 
syntactic representation which does 
not involve ellipsis. Our solution is to 
introduce a syntactic onstituent which 
we call an "s-operator": we define this 
implicit ly by saying that an "s- 
operator" and a sentential complement 
combine to form a clause. 1 Thus the 
italicized portions of the sentences 
above are deemed to be s-operators, 
and in each of them the s-operator's 
1 In a categorial grammar framework like HPSG 
(Pollard & Sag 88), we could simply identify an s- 
operator with a constituent of the form S/S-COMP. 
It is fairly straightforward to define s-operators in 
XG-grammar. 
54 
missing complement is viewed as a 
kind of null pronoun. 
Although this move may in English 
seem syntactically quite unmotivated, 
there are other languages where 
evidence can be found to support the 
claim that these pronouns really exist. 
In Russian,  where comparat ive 
constructions very closely follow the 
English and Swedish patterns, they can 
optionally appear in the surface 
structure as the pronoun ~ 1"0. The 
following sentence illustrates this. 
OH K~H'I'I4,rl 60JII, LUe KHWr qeH ~ 3TO 
He bought more books than I ~T0 
n~Ma~. 
thought. 
Semantically, the analysis of such 
sentences is exactly parallel to that in 
the preceding subsection. Comparing 
4b) with 3), the "initial part" is most 
people, and the "contrasted elements" 
are the s-operator Mary said and an 
implicit trivial s-operator which we 
can write as (it is true that). The 
"duplicated part" is the predicate is a P 
such that P paid amount of money 
where . We can sketch a 
"Montagovian" analysis similar to that 
in table 2 
"Montagovian" analysis of s-operator comparative 
(paid(x,y) is to be read as "x paid y amount of money") 
1. most people 
2. Mary said

4. paid 
5. paid more than Mary said

The implementation of this analysis in 
terms of quant-tree rewriting rules 
involves only a slight extension of the 
method described in section 4.1 above. 
The reader is referred to the program 
code in the full paper for the concrete 
details. 
55 
4.3. "Parallel" phrasal comparatives 
Comparative constructions of the type 
i l lustrated in 5a) have been the object 
of cons iderab le  controversy.  The 
orthodox position was that they were 
"parallel" constructions: 5a) would  
thus be a reduced form of 5b). 
5a) More women than men read 
'1-Iouse and Garden". 
5b) More women read "House and 
Garden" than men read "House 
and Garden". 
Pinkham, however, gives good reasons 
for supposing that this is not the case, 
and that the construction is in some 
sense base generated phrasal (p.121- 
123). It will presumably not come as a 
revelation to hear that we agree with 
this idea, though we express it in a 
somewhat different way. 
Our  in terpreta t ion  of P inkham's  
analysis recasts the more  ... than. . .  
construct ion as a special k ind of 
determiner.  We introduce an extra 
rule for NP formation: in addition to 
the normal NP --~ Det + CN, we also 
have NP --~ CompDet + CN + CN. (The 
details can be found in the full paper). 
This allows us as usual to give the 
constituent structure wi thout  use of 
ellipsis, and then to interpret it using a 
suitable predicate-copying operation. 
Once again we i l lustrate wi th  a 
Montague-style example.

Table 4 
It is in terest ing to compare our 
t reatment  w i th  that suggested in 
(Keenan & Stavi 86) (p.282-284) for 
comparat ive adjectival constructions 
l ike that  in 6a); they  argue  
convinc ing ly  that these are to be 
regarded as directly interpreted, rather 
than as "reduced forms" of sentences 
like 6b). It seems to us that their 
arguments can be adapted to support 
the analys is  of "parallel" phrasals  
given above; so if we were to extend 
their example, we would have that 6b) 
in its turn was also to be interpreted 
directly,  rather than considered a 
reduction of 6c). 
6a) More male than female students 
passed the exam. 
56 
6b) More male students than female 
students passed the exam. 
6c) More male students passed the 
exam than female students passed 
the exam. 
5 "SIMPLE" PHRASAL 
COMPARATIVES 
We finally turn our attention to a third 
type of comparat ive  construct ion,  
which does not properly seem to fit 
into any of the patterns given above. 
We start by giving in 7) - 9) some 
examples of the kind of sentence we 
have in mind. 
7) Mary seems brighter than most 
pupils. 
8) He ran faster than the world record. 1
9) John needs a bigger 2 spanner than 
the No. 4. 
P inkham uses constructions like these 
as her  key  examples  when 
demonstrat ing the existence of base- 
generated  phrasa l  comparat ives .  
Looking for instance, at 9), we claim 
with P inkham that the most natural 
solution is to treat bigger spanner than 
the No. 4 as a dosed constituent with a 
semantic interpretat ion which does 
not involve the rest of the sentence. 
It may not be obvious at first why this 
should be so, and we pause briefly to 
examine the possible alternatives.  
Firstly, suppose that we tried to use a 
reduct ion/predicate copying account. 
This would make 9) a form of 9a): 
9a) John needs a (big to extent X) 
spanner, X such that John needs 
the (big to extent Y) No. 4. spanner, 
X>Y. 
implying that John needs the No. 4. 
This is clearly wrong; the "needs" isn't 
copied in any way, and in fact the scope 
of any copying operat ion must  be 
l imited to the phrase bigger spanner 
than the No. 4. If we are absolutely 
bent on using copying, it appears to us 
that the only way in which it can be 
done is to treat 9) as derived from 9c) 
through 913) 
9b) John needs a spanner which is 
bigger than the No. 4. 
9c) John needs a spanner which is (big 
to extent X), X such that the No. 4 
is (big to extent Y), X > Y. 
To be honest,  we can't completely 
discount his approach. However, since 
it makes bigger than the No. 4 into a 
constituent in the intermediate 9b), we 
think it simpler to interpret he phrase 
structure directly, as is i l lustrated in 
the following Montagovian analysis. 
1pinkham's example 124a, p. 136 
2 We will treat "bigger" as though it were actually 
"more big" for the usual reasons.

Tables 
It will be apparent hat bigger than the 
No. 4 turns up as a constituent here 
too, and thus our solution is in a sense 
equivalent  with the alternate one 
proposed above. This is a striking 
illustration of the difficulties that can 
attend any efforts to make rigorous 
compar i sons  between d i f fe rent  
syntactic-semantic analyses of natural- 
language constructions. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented a method for 
syntactic and semantic interpretation 
of comparat ive sentences. This has 
been done by dividing our material 
into three separate groups, each of 
which are treated ifferently: 
Clausal comparatives (section 3), 
which are handled by extraposing 
a constituent containing a Q,  
fol lowing P inkham's  theoretical 
analysis.

using "predicate copying". 
? "Simple" phrasals (section 5), 
handled by a different direct 
interpretation method. 
We do not claim that this classification 
is the only way to explain the facts; as 
we  have said above, it would be 
possible to rewrite simple phrasal 
comparatives into directly interpreted 
phrasal comparatives, and also to 
rewrite directly interpreted phrasal 
comparatives as clausal comparatives. 
We think, however, that this 
manoevre would give us nothing in 
the form of real gains; even though a 
unified solution might seem more 
elegant, the syntactic transformations 
needed are more complicated than the 
use of different categories. Thus our 
first argument against a unified 
approach is the practical one: we  need 
do less work as implementors if we  
adopt the classification described here. 
Despite this, we  suspect that many  
readers (especially those more  
theoretically than practically inclined) 
would find it comforting to have some 
direct evidence that supports our point 
of view. In this connection we think 
that the following data from Swedish 
may be of interest. 
Comparative constructions in Swedish 
are v i r tua l ly  ident ical  to the 
corresponding ones in English. One 
significant difference, however, is the 
distribution of the relative pronoun 
vad ("what"); this can optionally be 
inserted after the comparative marker 
in some constructions, as shown in I0) 
and 11) I . 
10) Johan k6pte tier b6ckex /in 
John bought more books than 
(vad) Maria gjorde. 
(what) Mary did. 
11) Johan bar ett dyrare 
John has a more expensive 
hus ~in (vad) jag har. 
house than (what) I have. 
Given the correspondences between 
clausal comparison and relative 
clauses described in section 4, it is very 
tempting to account for the "vad" as a 
relat ive pronoun real iz ing the 
normally null Q. If we are prepared to 
accept this, it then appears ignificant 
that "vad" may not be used in most 
phrasal comparatives, as shown in 12) 
and 13). This would seem problematic 
for a transformational ccount, but is 
quite natural if phrasal comparatives 
are treated by direct interpretation; 
there isn't any Q, so it can't be realized 
as a "vad". 
14) \]ohan k6pte tier b6cker /in

(*vad) Maria.

5.1 above, as shown in 16). 
16) Johan k6pte tier b6cker gn

(what) Mary thought. 
We are not certain how to explain 
this, and leave the reader to judge the 
facts for himself1; but despite this 
irregularity, we think the other data 
gives our theory a considerable 
amount of concrete backing. 
APPENDIX: TERMINOLOGY 
Comparative Clause: the clause 
introduced by the comparison marker. 
Compared Element: the largest 
constituent in the main or the 
comparat ive clause, the leftmost 
element of which is a comparison 
marker or the comparative quantifier 
Q. 
Comparison Marker: words like than, 
as, before, after. 
Head of the Comparison: refers to the 
compared element in the main clause. 
Phrasal Comparative: a comparative 
complement which appears to be the 
reduced form of a comparative clause. 
This may be a remnant  of the 
application of Comparative Ellipsis to a 
comparative clause, or it may be base 
generated. 
Q: An (implicit or explicit) comparison 
quantifier which is extraposed in the 
interpretation f clausal comparatives.

1 One possibility is that this is a result of cognitive 
limitations in the human sentence-processing 
mechanism, since an arbitrary amount of text can 
separate a "vad" from the realization that the 
construction is s-operator ather than clausal 
comparison.
