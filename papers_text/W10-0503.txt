Detecting Word Misuse in Chinese

Abstract
Social Network Service (SNS) and personal
blogs have become the most popular platform
for online communication and sharing infor-
mation. However because most modern com-
puter keyboards are Latin-based, Asian lan-
guage speakers (such as Chinese) has to rely
on a input system which accepts Romanisation
of the characters and convert them into charac-
ters or words in that language. In Chinese this
form of Romanisation (usually called Pinyin)
is highly ambiguous, word misuses often oc-
cur because the user choose a wrong candi-
date or deliverately substitute the word with
another character string that has the identical
Romanisation to convey certain semantics, or
to achieve a sarcasm effect. In this paper we
aim to develop a system that can automati-
cally identify such word misuse, and suggest
the correct word to be used.
1 Introduction
A certain kind of derogatory opinion is being con-
veyed in Chinese chat forums and SNS sites through
the use of Chinese Hanzi (hieroglyphic) characters.
There is potential for this to happen whenever two
expressions are pronounced in a similar way in Chi-
nese. For exmaple, irate readers have used ????
(?Ji Zhe?) for ???? (?Ji Zhe?). While ????
means reporter or journalist, ???? can be inter-
preted as prostitute.
There are 5000 commonly used characters. While
the number of distinct Pinyin (toneless) is only 412.
Therefore Pinyin to character conversion is highly
ambigurous and is a active research topic (Zhou
et al, 2007), (Lin and Zhang, 2008), (Chen and
Lee, 2000). On the other hand, automatic Pinyin
generation is considered a solved task, (Liu and
Guthrie, 2009) shows that using the most frequent
Pinyin approach to assign Pinyin to each character
can achieve 98% accuracy. In fact, we test on the Gi-
gaword Chinese (Verson 2) corpus and find out that
only about 15% of the characters have ambigurous
Pinyin.
2 Automatically Detecting Word Misuse
We divided the detection process into three steps as
below:
? Segmentation: Given a piece of Chinese text,
we first feed it into an automatic word seg-
menter (Zhang et al, 2003) to break the text
into semantic units. Because we consider only
multiple-character anomaly cases, anomalies
can only be contained within sequences of sin-
gle characters.
? Character sequence extraction: After segmen-
tation, we are interested in sequences of sin-
gle characters, because anomalies will occur
only within those sequences. Once we obtain
these sequences, we generate all possible sub-
strings for each sequence because any anoma-
lous words can be part of a character sequence.
? Detection: We assume the anomaly shares
many phonetic similarities with the ?true?
word. As a result we need a method for
comparing pronunciations of two character se-
quences. Here we use the Pinyin to represent
phonetics of a Chinese character, and we de-
fine two pronunciations to be similar when they
both have identical Pinyin (not including the
tone). We use character-to-pinyin conversion

ing the machine-segmented Chinese Gigaword

ver. 2. Once we have the resources, we first
produce all possible Pinyin sequences of each
character sequence.Next we do a Pinyin-word
look up in the hash table we created; if there
exists any entries, we know that the Pinyin se-
quence maps to one or more ?real? words. Con-
sequently, we consider any character sequences
whose Pinyin maps to these words to be possi-
ble anomalies.
3 Data and Experiments
We have conducted preliminary experiments to test
our algorithm. To start with, we manually gath-
ered a small number of documents which contain
anomalous phrases of the type described above. The
documents are gathered from internet chat-rooms
and contain 3,797 Chinese characters: the anoma-
lies herein are shown in table 1.

3.1 Results and Discussions
We evaluate our identification/correction perfor-
mance using standard measures of standard preci-
sion and recall. We tested our performance using
bigram thresholds of 0, 1 and 2.
Table 2 shows the performances of our method.
No. of misused chararcter sequence 78
Total identified 130
Correctly identified 78
Precision 60%
Recall 100%
F-measure 75%
Table 2: Result for word misuse identification
The initial experiments showed that our method
can successfully identify and correct the three ex-
amples of non-word anomalies with reasonable pre-
cision and recall. The method obtains 100% recall
however it generates a lot of false positives; this can
be seen in a relatively low precision of 60%.
In summary, our method is successful at iden-
tifying genuine anomalous non-word character se-
quences; however the method also retrieves some
false positives, due to the highly ambiguous Pinyin
to word mappings.
4 Future Work
Our experiments shows that our preliminary method
can detect word misuses due to the Pinyin sequence
being idential but with a relatively high false posi-
tives. In the future we plan to use other contextual
evidence, such as pointwise mutual information to
model whether the candidate sequence generated by
our method is a better fit than the original sequence.
We also plan to gather more real data that contain
misuse of our interests.
