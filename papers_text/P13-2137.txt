Abstract
We report on the first structured dis-
tributional semantic model for Croatian,
DM.HR. It is constructed after the model
of the English Distributional Memory (Ba-
roni and Lenci, 2010), from a dependency-
parsed Croatian web corpus, and covers
about 2M lemmas. We give details on the
linguistic processing and the design prin-
ciples. An evaluation shows state-of-the-
art performance on a semantic similarity
task with particularly good performance on
nouns. The resource is freely available.
1 Introduction
Most current work in lexical semantics is based
on the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954),
which posits a correlation between the degree of
words? semantic similarity and the similarity of
the contexts in which they occur. Using this hy-
pothesis, word meaning representations can be ex-
tracted from large corpora. Words are typically rep-
resented as vectors whose dimensions correspond
to context features. The vector similarities, which
are interpreted as semantic similarities, are used in
numerous applications (Turney and Pantel, 2010).
Most vector spaces in current use are either word-
based (co-occurrence defined by surface window,
context words as dimensions) or syntax-based (co-
occurrence defined syntactically, syntactic objects
as dimensions). Syntax-based models have sev-
eral desirable properties. First, they are model to
fine-grained types of semantic similarity such as
predicate-argument plausibility (Erk et al, 2010).
Second, they are more versatile ? Baroni and Lenci
(2010) have presented a generic framework, the
Distributional Memory (DM), which is applicable
to a wide range of tasks beyond word similarity.
Third, they avoid the ?syntactic assumption? in-
herent in word-based models, namely that context
words are relevant iff they are in an n-word window
around the target. This property is particularly rele-
vant for free word order languages with many long
distance dependencies and non-projective structure
(Ku?bler et al, 2009). Their obvious problem, of
course, is that they require a large parsed corpus.
In this paper, we describe the construction of
a Distributional Memory for Croatian (DM.HR),
a free word order language. To do so, we parse
hrWaC (Ljubes?ic? and Erjavec, 2011), a 1.2B-token
Croatian web corpus. We evaluate DM.HR on a
synonym choice task, where it outperforms the
standard bag-of-word model for nouns and verbs.
2 Related Work
Vector space semantic models have been applied
to a number of Slavic languages, including Bul-
garian (Nakov, 2001a), Czech (Smrz? and Rychly?,
2001), Polish (Piasecki, 2009; Broda et al, 2008;
Broda and Piasecki, 2008), and Russian (Nakov,
2001b; Mitrofanova et al, 2007). Previous work
on distributional semantic models for Croatian
dealt with similarity prediction (Ljubes?ic? et al,
2008; Jankovic? et al, 2011) and synonym detec-
tion (Karan et al, 2012), however using only word-
based and not syntactic-based models.
So far the only DM for a language other than
English is the German DM.DE by Pado? and Utt
(2012), who describe the process of building
DM.DE and the evaluation on a synonym choice
task. Our work is similar, though each language
has its own challenges. Croatian, like other Slavic
languages, has rich inflectional morphology and
free word order, which lead to errors in linguistic
processing and affect the quality of the DM.

3 Distributional Memory
DM represents co-occurrence information in a gen-
eral, non-task-specific manner, as a tensor, i.e., a
three-dimensional matrix, of weighted word-link-
word tuples. Each tuple is mapped onto a number
by scoring function ? : W ? L ?W ? R+, that
reflects the strength of the association. When a par-
ticular task is selected, a vector space for this task
can be generated from the tensor by matricization.
Regarding the examples from Section 1, synonym
discovery would use a word by link-word space
(W ? LW ), which contains vectors for words w
represented by pairs ?l, w? of a link and a context
word. Analogy discovery would use a word-word
by link space (WW ? L), which represents word
pairs ?w1, w2? by vectors over links l.
The links can be chosen to model any relation
of interest between words. However, as noted by
Pado? and Utt (2012), dependency relations are the
most obvious choice. Baroni and Lenci (2010) in-
troduce three dependency-based DM variants: De-
pDM, LexDM, and TypeDM. DepDM uses links
that correspond to dependency relations, with sub-
categorization for subject (subj tr and subj intr)
and object (obj and iobj). Furthermore, all prepo-
sitions are lexicalized into links (e.g., ?sun, on,
Sunday?). Finally, the tensor is symmetrized: for
each tuple ?w1, l, w2?, its inverse ?w2, l?1, w1? is
included. The other two variants are more complex:
LexDM uses more lexicalized links, encoding, e.g.,
lexical material between the words, while TypeDM
extends LexDM with a scoring function based on
lexical variability.
Following the work of Pado? and Utt (2012), we
build a DepDM variant for DM.HR. Although Ba-
roni and Lenci (2010) show that TypeDM can out-
perform the other two variants, DepDM often per-
forms at a comparable level, while being much
simpler to build and more efficient to compute.
4 Building DM.HR
To build DM.HR, we need to collect co-occurrence
counts from a corpus. Since no sufficiently large
suitable corpus exists for Croatian, we first explain
how we preprocessed, tagged, and parsed the data.
Corpus and preprocessing. We adopted hrWaC,
the 1.2B-token Croatian web corpus (Ljubes?ic? and
Erjavec, 2011), as starting point. hrWaC was built
with the aim of obtaining a cleaner-than-usual web
corpus. To this end, a conservative boilerplate re-
moval procedure was used; Ljubes?ic? and Erjavec
(2011) report a precision of 97.9% and a recall of
70.7%. Nonetheless, our inspection revealed that,
apart from the unavoidable spelling and grammati-
cal errors, hrWaC still contains non-textual content
(e.g., code snippets and formatting structure), en-
coding errors, and foreign-language content. As
this severely affects linguistic processing, we addi-
tionally filtered the corpus.
First, we removed from hrWaC the content
crawled from main discussion forum and blog web-
sites. This content is highly ungrammatical and
contains a lot of non-diacriticized text, typical for
user-generated content. This step alone removed
one third of the data. We processed the remaining
content with a tokenizer and a sentence segmenter
based on regular expressions, obtaining 66M sen-
tences. Next, we applied a series of heuristic filters
at the document- and sentence-level. At the doc-
ument level, we discard all documents (1) whose
length is below a specified threshold, (2) contain
no diacritics, (3) contain no words from a list of fre-
quent Croatian words, or (4) contain a single word
from lists of distinctive foreign-language words
(for Serbian). The last two steps serve to eliminate
foreign-language content. In particular, the last
step serves to filter out the text in Serbian, which at
the sentence-level is difficult to automatically dis-
criminate from Croatian. At the sentence-level, we
discard sentences that are (1) shorter than a speci-
fied threshold, (2) contain non-standard symbols,
(3) contain non-diacriticized Croatian words, or
(4) contain too many foreign words from a list of
foreign-language words (for English and Slovene).
The last step filters out specifically the sentences
in English and Slovene, as we found that these of-
ten occur mixed with text in Croatian. The final
filtered version of hrWaC contains 51M sentences
and 1.2B tokens. The corpus is freely available for
download, along with a more detailed description
of the preprocessing steps.1
Tagging, lemmatization, and parsing. For mor-
phosyntactic (MSD) tagging, lemmatization, and
dependency parsing of hrWaC, we use freely avail-
able tools with models trained on the new SETimes
Corpus of Croatian (SETIMES.HR), based on the
Croatian part of the SETimes parallel corpus.2 SE-
TIMES.HR and the derived tools are prototypes

that are about to be released as parts of another
work. Here we give a general description and a
re-evaluation that we consider relevant for building
DM.HR.
SETIMES.HR consists of 90K tokens and 4K
sentences, manually lemmatized and MSD-tagged
according to Multext East v4 tagset (Erjavec, 2012),
with the help of the Croatian Lemmatization Server
(Tadic?, 2005). It is used also as a basis for a novel
formalism for syntactic annotation and dependency
parsing of Croatian (Agic? and Merkler, 2013).
On the basis of previous evaluation for Croa-
tian (Agic? et al, 2008; Agic? et al, 2009; Agic?,
2012) and availability and licensing considerations,
we chose HunPos tagger (Hala?csy et al, 2007),
CST lemmatizer (Ingason et al, 2008), and MST-
Parser (McDonald et al, 2006) to process hrWaC.
We evaluated the tools on 100-sentence test sets
from SETIMES.HR and Wikipedia; performance
on Wikipedia should be indicative of the perfor-
mance on a cross-domain dataset, such as hrWaC.
In Table 1 we show lemmatization and tagging ac-
curacy, as well as dependency parsing accuracy
in terms of labeled attachment score (LAS). The
results show that lemmatization, tagging and pars-
ing accuracy improves on the state of the art for
Croatian. The SETIMES.HR dependency parsing
models are publicly available.3
Syntactic patterns. We collect the co-occur-
rence counts of tuples using a set of syntactic pat-
terns. The patterns effectively define the link types,
and hence the dimensions of the semantic space.
Similar to previous work, we use two sorts of links:
unlexicalized and lexicalized.
For unlexicalized links, we use ten syntactic pat-
terns. These correspond to the main dependency re-
lations produced by our parser: Pred for predicates,
Atr for attributes, Adv for adverbs, Atv for verbal
complements, Obj for objects, Prep for preposi-
tions, and Pnom for nominal predicates. We sub-
categorized the subject relation into Sub tr (sub-

jects of transitive verbs) and Sub intr (subject of
intransitive verbs). The motivation for this is better
modeling of verb semantics by capturing diathe-
sis alternations. In particular, for many Croatian
verbs reflexivization introduces a meaning shift,
e.g., predati (to hand in/out) vs. predati se (to
surrender). With subject subcategorization, re-
flexive and irreflexive readings will have differ-
ent tensor representations; e.g., ?student, Subj tr,
zadac?a? (?student, Subj tr, homework?) vs. ?trupe,
Subj intr, napadac?? (?troops, Subj intr, invadors?).
Finally, similar to Pado? and Utt (2012), we use
Verb as an underspecified link between subjects
and objects linked by non-auxiliary verbs.
For lexicalized links, we use two more extraction
patterns for prepositions and verbs. Prepositions
are directly lexicalized as links; e.g., ?mjesto, na,
sunce? (?place, on, sun?). The same holds for non-
auxiliary verbs linking subjects to objects; e.g.,
?drz?ava, kupiti, kolic?ina? (?state, buy, amount?).
Tuple extraction and scoring. The overall qual-
ity of the DM.HR depends on the accuracy of ex-
tracted tuples, which is affected by all preprocess-
ing steps. We computed the performance of tu-
ple extraction by evaluating a sample of tuples
extracted from a parsed version of SETIMES.HR
against the tuples extracted from the SETIMES.HR
gold annotations (we use the same sample as for
tagging and parsing performance evaluation). Ta-
ble 2 shows Precision, Recall, and F1 score. Over-
all, we achieve the best performance on the Atr
links, followed by Pred links. The performance is
generally higher on unlexicalized links than on lex-
icalized links (note that performance on unlexical-

Table 3: Top 16 LMI-scored tuples for the verb

ized Verb links is identical to overall performance
on lexicalized verb links). The overall F1 score of
tuple extraction is 74.6%.
Following DM and DM.DE, we score each
extracted tuple using Local Mutual Information
(LMI) (Evert, 2005):
LMI(i, j, k) = f(i, j, k) log P (i, j, k)P (i)P (j)P (k)
For a tuple (w1, l, w2), LMI scores the association
strength between word w1 and word w2 via link l
by comparing their joint distribution against the dis-
tribution under the independence assumption, mul-
tiplied with the observed frequency f(w1, l, w2) to
discount infrequent tuples. The probabilities are
computed from tuple counts as maximum likeli-
hood estimates. We exclude from the tensor all
tuples with a negative LMI score. Finally, we sym-
metrize the tensor by introducing inverse links.
Model statistics. The resulting DM.HR tensor
consists of 2.3M lemmas, 121M links and 165K
link types (including inverse links). On average,
each lemma has 53 links. This makes DM.HR
more sparse than English DM (796 link types), but
less sparse than German DM (220K link types; 22
links per lemma). Table 3 shows an example of
the extracted tuples for the verb kupiti (to buy).
DM.HR tensor is freely available for download.4
5 Evaluating DM.HR
Task. We present a pilot evaluation DM.HR on a
standard task from distributional semantics, namely
synonym choice. In contrast to tasks like predict-
ing word similarity We use the dataset created by
Karan et al (2012), with more than 11,000 syn-
onym choice questions. Each question consists of
one target word (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) with

four synonym candidates (one is correct). The ques-
tions were extracted automatically from a machine-
readable dictionary of Croatian. An example item
is tez?ak (farmer): poljoprivrednik (farmer), um-
jetnost (art), radijacija (radiation), bod (point).
We sampled from the dataset questions for nouns,
verbs, and adjectives, with 1000 questions each.5
Additionally, we manually corrected some errors
in the dataset, introduced by the automatic extrac-
tion procedure. To make predictions, we compute
pairwise cosine similarities of the target word vec-
tors with the four candidates and predict the can-
didate(s) with maximal similarity (note that there
may be ties).
Evaluation. Our evaluation follows the scheme
developed by Mohammad et al (2007), who define
accuracy as the average number of correct predic-
tions per covered question. Each correct prediction
with a single most similar candidate receives a full
credit (A), while ties for maximal similarity are
discounted (B: two-way tie, C: three-way tie, D:
four-way tie): A+ 12B+ 13C+ 14D. We consider aquestion item to be covered if the target and at least
one answer word are modeled. In our experiments,
ties occur when vector similarities are zero for all
word pairs (due to vector sparsity). Note that a
random baseline would perform at 0.25 accuracy.
As baseline to compare against the DM.HR, we
build a standard bag-of-word model from the same
corpus. It uses a ?5-word within-sentence con-
text window, and the 10,000 most frequent context
words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) as dimensions.
We also compare against BOW-LSA, a state-of-
the-art synonym detection model from Karan et
al. (2012), which uses 500 latent dimensions and
paragraphs as contexts. We determine the signifi-
cance of differences between the models by com-
puting 95% confidence intervals with bootstrap re-
sampling (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).
Results. Table 4 shows the results for the three
considered models on nouns (N), adjectives (A),
5Available at: http://takelab.fer.hr/crosyn
787
and verbs (V). The performance of BOW-LSA
differs slightly from that reported by Karan et al
(2012), because we evaluate on a sample of their
dataset. DM.HR outperforms the baseline BOW
model for nouns and verbs (differences are sig-
nificant at p < 0.05). Moreover, on these cate-
gories DM.HR performs slightly better than BOW-
LSA, but the differences are not statistically sig-
nificant. Conversely, on adjectives BOW-LSA per-
forms slightly better than DM.HR, but the differ-
ence is again not statistically significant. All mod-
els achieve comparable and almost perfect cov-
erage on this dataset (BOW-LSA achieves com-
plete coverage because of the way how the original
dataset was filtered).
Overall, the biggest improvement over the base-
line is achieved for nouns. Nouns occur as heads
and dependents of many link types (unlexicalized
and lexicalized), and are thus well represented in
the semantic space. On the other hand, adjectives
seem to be less well modeled. Although the major-
ity of adjectives occur as heads or dependents of
the Atr relation, for which extraction accuracy is
the highest (cf. Table 2), it is likely that a single link
type is not sufficient. As noted by a reviewer, more
insight could perhaps be gained by comparing the
predictions of BOW-LSA and DM.HR models. The
generally low performance on verbs suggests that
their semantic is not fully covered in word- and
syntax-based spaces.
6 Conclusion
We have described the construction of DM.HR, a
syntax-based distributional memory for Croatian
built from a dependency-parsed web corpus. To the
best of our knowledge, DM.HR is the first freely
available distributional memory for a Slavic lan-
guage. We have conducted a preliminary evalua-
tion of DM.HR on a synonym choice task, where
DM.HR outperformed the bag-of-word model and
performed comparable to an LSA model.
This work provides a starting point for a sys-
tematic study of dependency-based distributional
semantics for Croatian and similar languages. Our
first priority will be to analyze how corpus prepro-
cessing and the choice of link types relates to model
performance on different semantic tasks. Better
modeling of adjectives and verbs is also an impor-
tant topic for future research.
