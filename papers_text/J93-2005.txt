In this paper we outline a research program for computational linguistics, making extensive use 
of text corpora. We demonstrate how a semantic framework for lexical knowledge can suggest 
richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence. The work suggests 
how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploitable for semantic 
tagging of lexical items. Unlike with purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework 
of a semantic theory allows the automatic onstruction of predictions about deeper semantic 
relationships among words appearing in collocational systems. We illustrate the approach for 
the acquisition oflexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can 
fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary. 
In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning 
lexical presuppositions and preference r lations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed 
with the appropriate semantic tools. Finally, we discuss the potential that corpus studies have for 
enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm 
linguistic hypotheses. 
1. Introduction 
The proliferation of on-line textual information poses an interesting challenge to lin- 
guistic researchers for several reasons. First, it provides the linguist with sentence and 
word usage information that has been difficult to collect and consequently argely 
ignored by linguists. Second, it has intensified the search for efficient automated in- 
dexing and retrieval techniques. FulMext indexing, in which all the content words in 
a document are used as keywords, is one of the most promising of recent automated 
approaches, yet its mediocre precision and recall characteristics indicate that there is 
much room for improvement (Croft 1989). The use of domain knowledge can enhance 
the effectiveness of a full-text system by providing related terms that can be used to 
broaden, narrow, or refocus a query at retrieval time (Debili, Fluhr, and Radasua 1988; 
Anick et al 1989. Likewise, domain knowledge may be applied at indexing time to 
do word sense disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft 1989) or content analysis (Jacobs 
1991). Unfortunately, for many domains, such knowledge, even in the form of a the- 
saurus, is either not available or is incomplete with respect o the vocabulary of the 
texts indexed.

In this paper we examine how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and po- 
lysemy might be exploited for the semantic tagging of lexical items. Unlike purely 
statistical collocational analyses, employing a semantic theory allows for the auto- 
matic construction of deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collo- 
cational systems. We illustrate the approach for the acquisition of lexical information 
for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical 
structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary. In addi- 
tion to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning 
lexical presuppositions and preference r lations (Wilks 1978) can also be acquired from 
corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools. Finally, we discuss the 
potential that corpus studies have for enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic 
research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm linguistic hypotheses. 
The aim of our research is to discover what kinds of knowledge can be reliably 
acquired through the use of these methods, exploiting, as they do, general inguis- 
tic knowledge rather than domain knowledge. In this respect, our program is simi- 
lar to Zernik's (1989) work on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical 
categories. Our research, however, differs in two respects: first, we employ a more 
expressive lexical semantics; second, our focus is on all major categories in the lan- 
guage, and not just verbs. This is important since for full-text information retrieval, 
information about nominals is paramount, as most queries tend to be expressed as 
conjunctions of nouns. From a theoretical perspective, we believe that the contribu- 
tion of the lexical semantics of nominals to the overall structure of the lexicon has been 
somewhat neglected, relative to that of verbs. While Zernik (1989) presents ambiguity 
and metonymy as a potential obstacle to effective corpus analysis, we believe that 
the existence of motivated metonymic structures actually provides valuable clues for 
semantic analysis of nouns in a corpus. 
We will assume, for this paper, the general framework of a generative lexicon as 
outlined in Pustejovsky (1991). In particular, we make use of the principles of type 
coercion and qualia structure. This model of semantic knowledge associated with 
words is based on a system of generative devices that is able to recursively define 
new word senses for lexical items in the language. These devices and the associated 
dictionary make up a generative l xicon, where semantic information is distributed 
throughout the lexicon to all categories. The general framework assumes four basic 
levels of semantic description: argument structure, qualia structure, lexical inheritance 
structure, and event structure. 
Connecting these different levels is a set of generative devices that provide for 
the compositional interpretation of words in context. The most important of these 
devices is a semantic transformation called type coercion--analogous to coercion in 
programming languages--which captures the semantic relatedness between syntacti- 
cally distinct expressions. As an operation on types within a A-calculus, type coercion 
can be seen as transforming a monomorphic language into one with polymorphic 
types (cf. Cardelli and Wegner 1985). Argument, event, and qualia types must con- 
form to the well-formedness conditions defined by the type system defined by the 
lexical inheritance structure when undergoing operations of semantic omposition. ~ 
1 The details of type coercion need not concern us here. Briefly, however, whenever there exists a 
grammatical environment where more than one syntactic type satisfies the semantic type selected by 
the governing element, the governing element can be analyzed as coercing a range of surface types 
into a single semantic type. An example of subject ype coercion is a causative verb, semantically 
selecting an event as subject (as in (i)), but syntactically permitting a nonevent denoting NP (as in (ii)): 
i. The flood killed the grass. 
ii. The herbicide killed the grass.

One component of this approach, the qualia structure, specifies the different as- 
pects of a word's meaning through the use of subtyping. These include the subtypes 
CONSTITUTIVE, FORMAL, TELIC, and AGENTIVE. To illustrate how these are used, the 
qualia structure for book is given below. 2
? book(x ,y)  . \] 
GONST = in fo rmat ion(y l  \] 
FORMAL = physobj(x) \[ 
TELIC = read(T,w,y) \[ 
AGENTIVE = write(T,z,y)  J
This structured representation allows one to use the same lexical entry in different 
contexts, where the word refers to different qualia of the noun's denotation. For ex- 
ample, the sentences in (1)-(3) below refer to different aspects (or qualia) of the general 
meaning of book. 3 
Example 1 
This book weighs four ounces. 
Example 2 
John finished a book. 
Example 3 
This is an interesting book. 
Example 1 makes reference to the formal role, while 3 refers to the constitutive role. 
Example 2, however, can refer to either the telic or the agentive aspects given above. 
The utility of such knowledge for information retrieval is readily apparent. This theory 
claims that noun meanings should make reference to related concepts and the relations 
into which they enter. The qualia structure, thus, can be viewed as a kind of generic 
template for structuring this knowledge. Such information about how nouns relate to 
other lexical items and their concepts might prove to be much more useful in full-text 
information retrieval than what has come from standard statistical techniques. 
To illustrate how such semantic structuring might be useful, consider the general 
class of artifact nouns. A generative view of the lexicon predicts that by classifying 
an element into a particular category, we can generate many aspects of its semantic 
structure, and hence, its syntactic behavior. For example, the representation above for 
book refers to several word senses, all of which are logically related by the semantic 
template for an artifactual object. That is, it contains information, it has a material 
extension, it serves some function, and it is created by some particular act or event. 
2 Briefly, the qualia can be defined as follows: 
? CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituent parts; 
? FORMAL: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain; 
? TELIC: its purpose and function; 
? AGENTIVE: factors involved in its origin or "bringing it about." 
In the qualia structures given below, we adopt the convention that \[c~, r\] denotes conjunction of 
formulas within the feature structure, while \[a; r\] will denote disjunction. 
3 A related approach for expressing the different semantic relations of nominals in distinguished contexts 
is given in Bierwisch (1983). 
333 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
Such an analysis allows us to minimally structure objects according to these four 
qualia. 
As an example of how objects cluster according to these dimensions, we will 
briefly consider three object ypes: (1) containers (of information), e.g., book, tape, record; 
(2) instruments, e.g., gun, hammer, paintbrush; and (3) figure-ground objects, e.g., door, 
room, fireplace. Because of how their qualia structures differ, these classes appear in 
vastly different grammatical contexts. 
As with containers in general, information containers permit metonymic exten- 
sions between the container and the material contained within it. Collocations uch 
as those in Examples 4 through 7 indicate that this metonymy is grammaticalized 
through specific and systematic head-PP constructions. 
Example 4 
read a book 
Example 5 
read a story in a book 
Example 6 
read a tape 
Example 7 
read the information on the tape 
Instruments, on the other hand, display classic agent-instrument causative alter- 
nations, such as those in Examples 8 through 11 (cf. Fillmore 1968; Lakoff 1968, 1970). 
Example 8 
... smash the vase with the hammer 
Example 9 
The hammer smashed the vase. 
Example 10 
... kill him with a gun 
Example 11 
The gun killed him. 
Finally, figure-ground nominals (Pustejovsky and Anick 1988) permit perspective 
shifts such as those in Examples 12 through 15. These are nouns that refer to physical 
objects as well as the specific enclosure or aperture associated with it. 
Example 12 
John painted the door. 
Example 13 
John walked through the door. 
334 
James Pustejovsky et al Lexical Semantic Techniques for Corpus Analysis 
Example 14 
John is scrubbing the fireplace. 
Example 15 
The smoke filled the fireplace. 
That is, paint and scrub are actions on physical objects while walk through and 
fill are processes in spaces. These collocational patterns, we argue, are systematically 
predictable from the lexical semantics of the noun, and we term such sets of collocated 
structures lexical conceptual paradigms (LCPs). 4 
To make this point clearer, let us consider a specific example of an LCP from 
the computer science domain, namely for the noun tape. Because of the particular 
metonymy observed for a noun like tape, we will classify it as belonging to the con- 
tainer/containee LCP. This general class is represented as follows, where P and 0 are 
predicate variables: 5 
container(x,y) \] 
CONST = P(y) 
FORMAL = Q(x) 
TELIC = hold(S,x,y) 
The LCP is a generic qualia structure that captures not only the semantic relationship 
between arguments types of a relation, but also, through corpus-tuning, the collocation 
relations that realize these roles. The telic function of a container, for example, is the 
relation hold, but this underspecifies which spatial prepositions would adequately 
satisfy this semantic relation (e.g. in, on, inside, etc.). 
In this view, a noun such as tape would have the following qualia structure: 
tape(x,y) 
CONST = information(y) 
FORMAL = physobj(x),2-dimen(x) 
TELIC = contain(S,x,y) 
AGENTIVE = write(T,z,y) 
This states that a tape is an "information container" that is also a two-dimensional 
physical object, where the information is written onto the object. 6With such nouns, a 
logical metonymy exists (as the result of type coercion), when the logical argument of 
a semantic type, which is selected by a function of some sort, denotes the semantic 
type itself. Thus, in this example, the type selected for by a verb such as read refers to 
the "information" argument for tape, while a verb such as carry would select for the 
"physical object" argument. They are, however, logically related, since the noun itself 
denotes a relation. 
The representation above simply states that any semantics for tape must logically 
make reference to the object itself (formal), what it can contain (const), what purpose 
4 This relates to Mel'~uk's lexical functions and the syntactic structures they associate with an element. 
See Mel'~uk (1988) and references therein. Cruse (1986, 1992) and Nunberg (1978) discuss the 
foregrounding and backgrounding of information with respect o similar examples. 
5 Within the qualia structure for a term, FORMAL and CONST roles typically refer to the object domain 
while TELI? and ACENTIVE refer to events. Hence, the first parameter in the latter two roles refers to an 
event sort, i.e., a state (s), process (p), or transition (T). 
6 The appropriate selection of a surface spatial preposition will follow from its formal type specification 
as a 2-dimen object. Cf. Pustejovsky (in press) for details. 
335 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
it serves (telic), and how it arises (agentive). This provides us with a semantic repre- 
sentation that can capture the multiple perspectives a single lexical item may assume 
in different contexts. Yet, the qualia for a lexical item such as tape are not isolated 
values for that one word, but are integrated into a global knowledge base indicating 
how these senses relate to other lexical items and their senses. This is the contribution 
of inheritance and the hierarchical structuring of knowledge (cf. Evans and Gazdar 
1990; Copestake and Briscoe 1992; Russell et al 1992). In Pustejovsky (1991) it is sug- 
gested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge; a fixed 
inheritance similar to that of an i s -a  hierarchy (cf. Touretzky 1986); and a dynamic 
structure that operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create 
a relational structure for ad hoc categories. 7 
Reviewing briefly, the basic idea is that semantics allows for the dynamic cre- 
ation of arbitrary concepts through the application of certain transformations to lexical 
meanings. Thus for every predicate, Q, we can generate its opposition, =Q. Similarly, 
these two predicates can be related temporally to generate the transition events defin- 
ing this opposition. These operations include but may not be limited to: -~, negation; 
_<, temporal precedence; >, temporal succession; =, temporal equivalence; and act, an 
operator adding agency to an argument. We will call the concept space generated by 
these operations the Projective Conclusion Space of a specific quale for a lexical item. To 
return to the example of tape above, the predicates read and copy are related to the telic 
value by just such an operation, while predicates such as mount and dismount--i.e, un- 
mount--are related to the formal role. Following the previous discussion, with mounted 
as the predicate Q, successive applications of the negation and temporal precedence 
operators derives the transition verbs mount and dismount. 8 We return to a discussion 
of this in Section 3, and to how this space relates to statistically significant collocations 
in text. 
It is our view that the approach outlined above for representing lexical knowl- 
edge can be put to use in the service of information retrieval tasks. In this respect, 
our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information sci- 
ence. One approach, known as faceted classification (Vickery 1975) proceeds roughly 
as follows: collect all terms lying within a field; then group the terms into facets by 
assigning them to categories. Typical examples of this are state, property, reaction, and 
device. However, each subject area is likely to have its own sets of categories, which 
makes it difficult to re-use a set of facet classifications. 9 
Even if the relational information provided by the qualia structure and inheri- 
tance would improve performance in information retrieval tasks, one problem still 
remains, namely that it would be very time-consuming to hand-code such structures 
for all nouns in a domain. Since it is our belief that such representations are generic 
structures across all domains, it is our long-term goal to develop methods for auto- 
matically extracting these relations and values from on-line corpora. In the sections 
that follow, we describe several experiments indicating that the qualia structures do, in 
fact, correlate with well-behaved collocational patterns, thereby allowing us to perform 
structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations. 
7 This is similar to thesauruslike structures, within the IR community, cf. for example Sparck Jones (1981). 
8 Details of the derivation are as follows. Let Q be mounted, then ~Q gives ~mounted, and K applied to 
these two states gives Q < -~Q, which is lexicalized as dismount. A similar derivation exists for mount. 
Cf. Pustejovsky (1991) for details. 
9 This is reflected in the sublanguage work of Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan (1986), whose automated 
discovery procedures are aimed at clustering nouns into categories like diagnosis and symptom.

2. Seeding Lexical Structures from MRDs 
In this section we discuss briefly how a lexical semantic theory can help in extract- 
ing information from machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs). We describe research on 
conversion of a machine-tractable dictionary (Wilks et al 1993) into a usable lexical 
knowledge base (Boguraev 1991). Although the results here are preliminary, it is im- 
portant to mention the process of converting an MRD into a lexical knowledge base, so 
that the process of corpus-tuning is put into the proper perspective. The initial seed- 
ing of lexical structures i being done independently both from the Oxford Advanced 
Learners Dictionary (OALD) and from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of 
Contemporary English (Procter, Ilson, and Ayto 1978). These are then automatically 
adapted to the format of generative l xical structures. It is these lexical structures that 
are then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in Anick 
and Pustejovsky (1990) and Pustejovsky (1992). 
Previous work by Amsler (1980), Calzolari (1984), Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn 
(1985), Byrd et al (1987), Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens (1986), and Nakamura 
and Nagao (1988) showed that taxonomic information and certain semantic relations 
can be extracted from MRDs using fairly simple techniques. Later work by Veronis 
and Ide (1991), Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder (1990), and Wilks et aL (1992) 
provides us with a number of techniques for transfering information from MRDs to a 
representation language such as that described in the previous ection. Our goal is to 
automate, to the extent possible, the initial construction of these structures. 
Extensive research as been done on the kind of information eeded by natural 
language programs and on the representation f that information (Wang, Vanden- 
dorpe, and Evens 1985; Ahlswede and Evens 1988). Following Boguraev et al (1989) 
and Wilks et al of 1989), we believe that much of what is needed for NLP lexicons can 
be found either explicitly or implicitly in a dictionary, and empirical evidence suggests 
that this information gives rise to a sufficiently rich lexical representation for use in 
extracting information from texts. Techniques for identifying explicit information in 
machine-readable dictionaries have been developed by many researchers (Boguraev 
et al 1989; Slator 1988; Slator and Wilks 1987; Guthrie et al 1990) and are well under- 
stood. Many properties of a word sense or the semantic relationships between word 
senses are available in MRDs, but this information can only be identified computa- 
tionally through some analysis of the definition text of an entry (Atkins 1991). Some 
research as already been done in this area. Alshawi (1987), Boguraev et al (1989), 
Vossen, Meijs, and den Broeder (1989), and the work described in Wilks et al (1992) 
have made explicit some kinds of implicit information found in MRDs. Here we pro- 
pose to refine and merge some of the previous techniques to make explicit he implicit 
information specified by a theory of generative l xicons. 
Given what we described above for the lexical structures for nominals, we can 
identify these semantic relations in the OALD and LDOCE by pattern matching on the 
parse trees of definitions. To illustrate what specific information can be derived by au- 
tomatic seeding from machine-readable dictionaries, consider the following examples) ? 
For example, the LDOCE definition for book is: 
"a collection of sheets of paper fastened together as a thing to be read, 
or to be written in" 
10 The following lexical entries, termed gls's, are taken from the lexical databases derived from the OALD 
using tools developed by Peter Dilworth, and from LDOCE using a combination f tools developed by 
Louise Guthrie, Gees Stein, and Pete Dilworth. 
337 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
while the OALD provides a somewhat different definition: 
"number of sheet of papers, either printed or blank, fastened together 
in a cover." 
Note that both definitions are close to, but not identical to the information structure 
suggested in the previous ection, using a qualia structure for nominals. LDOCE sug- 
gests write in rather than write as the value for the telic role, while the OALD suggests 
nothing for this role. Furthermore, although the physical contents of a book as "a 
collection of sheets of paper" is mentioned, nowhere is information made reference to 
in the definition. When the dictionary fails to provide the value for a semantic role, 
the information must be either hand-entered or the lexical structure must be tuned 
against a large corpus, in the hope of extracting such features automatically. We turn 
to this issue in the next two sections. 
Although the two dictionaries differ in substantial respects, it is remarkable how 
systematic the definition structures are for extracting semantic information, if there is a 
clear idea how this information should be structured. For example, from the following 
OALD definition for cigarette, 
cigarette n roll of shredded tobacco enclosed in thin paper for smok- 
ing. 
the initial lexical structure below is generated. 
gls (cigarette, 
syn( \[type (n), 
code(C)\] ), 
qualia ( \[formal( \[roll\] ), 
telic ( \[smoking\] ), 
const ( \[tobacco ,paper\] ), 
agent ( \[enclosed\] )\] ), 
cospec ( \[\] ) ) . 
Parsing the LDOCE entry for the same noun results in a different lexical structure: 
c igarette  n finely cut shredded tobacco rolled in a narrow tube of 
thin paper for smoking. 
gls (cigarette, 
syn( \[type (n), 
code(C), 
ldoce id(cigarette 0_1)\]), 
qualia( \[formal( \[tube\] ), 
telic( \[smoking\] ), 
const ( \[tobacco ,paper\] ), 
agent ( \[rolled\] )\] ), 
cospec ( \[\] ) ) . 
One obvious problem with the above representation is that there is no information 
indicating how the word being defined binds to the relations in the qualia. Currently, 
338 
James Pustejovsky et al Lexical Semantic Techniques for Corpus Analysis 
subsequent routines providing for argument binding analyze the relational structure 
for particular aspects of noun meaning, giving us a lexical structure fairly close to 
what we need for representation a d retrieval purposes, although the result is in no 
way ideal or uniform over all nominal forms. (cf. Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky 
\[1992\] for details of this operation on LDOCE.): 11 
cigarette(x) 
CONST = tobacco(y),shredded(y),paper(z) 
FOaMAL = roll(x) 
TELIC = smoke(T,w,x) 
AGENTIVE = artifact(x) 
In a related set of experiments performed while constructing a large lexical data- 
base for data extraction purposes, we seeded a lexicon with 6000 verbs from LDOCE. 
This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization 
acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky 
et al (1992). 
In summary, based on a theory of lexical semantics, we have discussed how an 
MRD can be useful as a corpus for automatically seeding lexical structures. Rather than 
addressing the specific problems inherent in converting MRDs into useful lexicons, 
we have emphasized how it provides us, in a sense, with a generic vocabulary from 
which to begin lexical acquisition over corpora. In the next section, we will address 
the problem of taking these initial, and often very incomplete l xical structures, and 
enriching them with information acquired from corpus analysis. As mentioned in 
the previous ection, the power of a generative l xicon is that it takes much of the 
burden of semantic interpretation ff of the verbal system by supplying a much richer 
semantics for nouns and adjectives. This makes the lexical structures ideal as an initial 
representation for knowledge acquisition and subsequent information retrieval tasks. 
3. Knowledge Acquisition from Corpora 
A machine-readable dictionary provides the raw material from which to construct 
computationally useful representations of the generic vocabulary contained within it. 
The lexical structures discussed in the previous ection are one example of how such 
information can be exploited. Many sublanguages, however, are poorly represented in 
on-line dictionaries, if represented atall. Vocabularies geared to specialized omains 
will be necessary for many applications, uch as text categorization a d information 
retrieval. The second area of our research program that we discuss is aimed at devel- 
oping techniques for building sublanguage l xicons via syntactic and statistical corpus 
analysis coupled with analytic techniques based on the tenets of generative l xicon 
theory. 
To understand fully the experiments described in the next two sections, we will 
refer to several semantic notions introduced in previous ections. These include type 
coercion, where a lexical item requires a specific type specification for its argument, and 
11 As one reviewer correctly pointed out, more than simple argument binding is involved here. For 
example, the model must know that paper can enclose shredded tobacco, but not the reverse. Such 
information, typically part of commonsense knowledge, is well outside the domain of lexical 
semantics, as envisioned here. One approach to this problem, consistent with our methodology, is to 
examine the corpus and the collocations that result from training on specific qualia relations. Further 
work will hopefully clarify the nature of this problem, and whether it is best treated lexically or not. 
339 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
the argument is able to change type accordingly--this explains the behavior of logical 
metonymy and the syntactic variation seen in complements o verbs and nominals; 
and cospecification, a semantic tagging of what collocational patterns the lexical item 
may enter into. 
Metonymy, in this view, can be seen as a case of the "licensed violation" of selec- 
tional restrictions. For example, while the verb announce selects for a human subject, 
sentences like The Dow Corporation announced third quarter losses are not only an accept- 
able paraphrase of the selectionally correct form Mr. Dow Jr. announced third quarter 
losses for Dow Corp, but they are the preferred form in the corpora being examined. 
This is an example of subject ype coercion, where the semantics for Dow Corp as a 
company must specify that there is a human typically associated with such official 
pronouncements (see Section 5). 12 
For one set of experiments, we used a corpus of approximately 3,000 articles writ- 
ten by Digital Equipment Corporation's Customer Support Specialists for an on-line 
computer troubleshooting library. The articles, each one- to two-page long descriptions 
of a problem and its solution, comprise about I million words. Our analysis proceeds 
in two phases. In the first phase, we pre-process the corpus to build a database of 
phrasal relationships. This consists briefly of the following steps: 
1. Perform unknown word resolution to the corpus. The corpus is 
searched for strings that are not members of a 25,000 word generic 
on-line English lexicon. Morphological analysis is then applied to these 
unknown strings to identify candidate citation forms and their likely 
morphological paradigms. Unless morphological evidence indicates 
otherwise, we enter unknown words into the lexicon as regular nouns; if 
there is evidence of some other morphological paradigm, such as verbal 
or adjectival suffixes, the word is entered into the lexicon accordingly. 
2. Corpus tagging. Once the lexicon is updated to include the new single 
word forms in the domain, the corpus is tagged with part-of-speech 
indicators. Any words that are ambiguous with respect o category are 
disambiguated according to a set of several dozen ordered 
disambiguation heuristics, which choose a category based on the 
categories of the words immediately preceding and following the 
ambiguous term. 
3. Partial parsing. The tagged corpus is then segmented into a fiat 
sequence of phrasal groupings, using closed class words such as 
prepositions and determiners, as well as certain part-of-speech 
transitions, to indicate likely phrase boundaries. No attempt is made to 
construct a full parse tree or resolve prepositional phrase attachment, 
conjunction scoping, etc. A concordance is constructed, identifying, for 
each word appearing in the corpus, the set of sentences, phrases, and 
phrase locations in which the word appears. 
12 Within the current framework, a distinction is made between logical metonymy, where the metonymic 
extension or relation is transparent from the lexical semantics of the coerced phrase, and conventional 
metonymy, where the relation may not be directly calculated from information provided grammatically. 
For example, in the sentence "The Boston office called today," it is not clear from logical metonymy 
what relation Boston bears to office other than location; i.e., it is not obvious that it is a branch office. 
This is well beyond lexical semantics (cf. Lakoff 1987 and Martin 1990). 
340 
James Pustejovsky et al Lexical Semantic Techniques for Corpus Analysis 
The database of partially parsed sentences provides the raw material for a number 
of sublanguage analyses. This begins the second phase of analysis: 
1. Noun compound recognition and bracketing. In technical sublanguages, 
noun compounds are often employed to expand the working vocabulary 
without he invention of new word forms. It is therefore useful in 
applications such as lexicon-assisted full-text information retrieval (Anick 
1992) to include such noun compounds as lexical items for both 
querying and thesaurus browsing. We construct bracketed noun 
compounds from our database of partial parses in a two-step rocess. 
The first simply searches the corpus for (recurring) contiguous sequences 
of nouns. Then, to bracket each compound that includes more than two 
nouns, we test whether possible subcomponents of the phrase exist on 
their own (as complete noun compounds) elsewhere in the corpus. 
Sample bracketed compounds derived from the computer 
troubleshooting database include \[ \[system anagement\] u t i l i ty \ ] ,  
\[TK50 \[tape drive\]\], \[\[database management\] system\]. 
2. Generation of taxonomic relationships on the basis of collocational 
information. Technical sublanguages often express ubclass relationships 
in noun compounds of the form <instance-name> <class-name>, as in 
"Unix operating system" and "C language." Unfortunately, noun 
compounds are also employed to express numerous other relationships, 
as in "Unix kernel" and "C debugger." We have found, however, that 
collocational evidence can be employed to suggest which noun 
compounds reflect axonomic relationships, using a strategy similar to 
that employed by Hindle (1990) for detecting synonyms. Given a term T, 
we extract from the phrase database those nouns Ni that appear as the 
head of any phrase in which T is the immediately preceding term. These 
nouns represent candidate classes of which T may be a member. We then 
generate the set of verbs that take T as direct object and calculate the 
mutual information value for each verb/T collocation (cf. Hindle 1990). 
We do the same for each noun Ni. Under the assumption that instance 
and class nouns are likely to co-occur with the same verbs, we compute 
a similarity score between T and each noun Ni, by summing the product 
of the mutual information values for those verbs occurring with both 
nouns. (Verbs with negative mutual information values are left out of the 
calculation.) The noun with the highest similarity score is often the class 
of which T is an instance, as illustrated by the sample results in Figure 1. 
For each word displayed in Figure 1, its "class" is the head noun with 
the highest similarity score. Other head nouns occurring with the word 
as modifier are listed as well. 
As with all the automated procedures described here, this algorithm 
yields useful, but imperfect results. The class chosen for "VMS," for 
example, is incorrect, and may reflect he fact that in a DEC 
troubleshooting database, authors ee no need to further specify VMS as 
"VMS operating system." A more interesting observation is that, among 
the collocations associated with the terms, there are often several that 
might qualify as classes of which the term is an instance, e.g., 
DECWindows could also be classified as "software"; TK50 might also 
qualify as "tape." From a generative l xicon perspective, these 
alternative classifications reflect multiple inheritance through the noun's

for TK50. DECWindows is functionally an "environment," its telic role, 
while "software" characterizes its formal quale. 
3. Extraction of information relating to noun's qualia. Under certain 
circumstances, it may be possible to elicit information about a noun's 
qualia from automated procedures on a corpus. In this line of research, 
we haved employed the notion of "lexical conceptual paradigm" 
described above. An LCP relates a set of syntactic behaviors to the 
lexical semantic structures of the participating lexical items. 
For example, the set of expressions involving the word "tape" in the 
context of its use as a secondary storage device suggests that it fits the 
container artifact schema of the qualia structure, with "information" and 
"file" as its containees: 
(a) read information from tape 
(b) write file to tape 
(c) read information on tape 
(d) read tape 
(e) write tape 
As mentioned in Section 1, containers tend to appear as objects of the 
prepositions to, from, in, and on as well as in direct object position, in 
which case they are typically serving metonymically for the containee. 
Thus, the container LCP relates the set of generalized syntactic patterns

to the underlying lexical semantic structure given below.

Verbs associated with direct object ape as direct object. 
This LCP includes a nominal alternation between the container and 
containee in the object position of verbs. For tape, this alternation is
manifested for verbs that predicate the telic role of data storage but not 
the formal role of physical object, which refers to the object as a whole 
regardless of its contents: 
TEL IC  : data-storage 
(a) read (tape/data from tape) 
(b) write (tape/data on tape) 
(c) copy (tape/data from tape) 
FORMAL= physical object 
(a) mount (tape) 
(b) dismount (tape) 
We have explored the use of heuristics to distinguish those predicates 
that relate to the Telic quale of the noun. Consider the word tape, which 
occurs as the direct object in 107 sentences in our corpus. It appears with 
a total of 34 different verbs. By applying the mutual information metric 
(MI) to the verb-object pairs, we can sort the verbs accordingly, giving us 
the table of verbs most highly associated with tape, shown in Figure 2. 
While the mutual information statistic does a good job of identifying 
verbs that semantically relate to the word tape, it provides no information 
about how the verbs relate to the noun's qualia structure. That is, verbs 
such as unload, position, and mount are selecting for the formal quale of 
tape, a physical object hat can be physically manipulated with respect o 
a tape drive. Read, write, and copy, on the other hand, relate to the telic 
role, the function of a tape as a medium for storing information. 
Our hypothesis was that the nominal alternation can help to 
distinguish the two sets of verbs. We reasoned that, if the alternation is
based on the container/containee metonymy, then it will be those verbs 
that apply to the telic role of the direct object hat participate in the 
alternation. We tested this hypothesis as follows. 
We generated a candidate set of containees for tape by identifying all 
the nouns that appeared in the corpus to the left of the adjunct on tape.

Intersection and set difference for three container nouns. 
Then we took the set of verbs that had one of these containee nouns as a 
direct object and compared this set to the set of verbs that had the 
container noun tape as a direct object in the corpus. According to our 
hypothesis, verbs applying to the telic role should appear in the 
intersection of these two sets (as a result of the alternation), while those 
applying to the formal role will appear in the set difference {verbs with 
containers as direct object}--{verbs with containees as direct object}. The 
difference operation should serve to remove any verbs that co-occur with 
containee objects. Figure 3 shows the results of intersection and set 
difference for three container nouns tape, disk, and directory. 
The results indicate that the container LCP is able to differentiate 
nouns with respect o their telic and formal qualia, for the nouns tape 
and disk but not for directory. The poor discrimination in the latter case 
can be attributed to the fact that a directory is a recursive container. A
directory contains files, and a directory is itself a file. Therefore, verbs 
that apply to the formal role of directory are likely to apply to the formal 
role of objects contained in directories (such as other directories). This 
can be seen as a shortcoming of the container LCP for the task at hand, 
but may be a useful way of diagnosing when containers contain objects 
functionally similar to themselves. 
The result of this corpus acquisition procedure is a kind of minimal faceted analysis 
for the noun tape, as illustrated below, showing only the qualia that are relevant o the 
discussion} 3

FORMAL = mount(z,x);dismount(z,x) 
TELIC = read(w,y);write(w,y);copy(w,y);contain(w,y) 
13 Because the technique was sensitive to grammatical position of the object NP, the argument can be 
bound to the appropriate variable in the relation expressed in the qualia. It should be pointed out that 
these qualia values do not carry event place variables, since such discrimination was beyond the scope 
of this experiment. 
344 
James Pustejovsky et al Lexical Semantic Techniques for Corpus Analysis 
What is interesting about the qualia values is how close they are to the concepts in 
the projective conclusion space of tape, as mentioned in Section 1. 
To illustrate this procedure on another semantic ategory, consider the term mouse 
in its computer artifact sense. In our corpus, it appears in the object position of the 
verb use in a "use NP to" construction, as well as the object of the preposition with 
following a transitive verb and its object: 
1. use the mouse to set breakpoints 
2. use the mouse anywhere 
3. move a window with the mouse 
4. click on it with the mouse . . .  
These constructions are symptomatic of its role as an instrument; and the VP 
complement of to as well as the VP dominating the with-PP identify the telic predicates 
for the noun. Other verbs, for which mouse appears as a direct object are currently 
defaulted into the formal role, resulting in an entry for mouse as follows: 
mouse(x) \] 
CONST = button(y) 
FORMAL = physobj(x) 
TEL IG  = set(x,breakpoint);move(x,window);click-on(x,z) 
The above experiments have met with limited success, enough to warrant continu- 
ing our application of lexical semantic theory to knowledge acquisition from corpora, 
but not enough to remove the human from the loop. As they currently exist, the 
algorithms described here can be used as tools to help the knowledge ngineer ex- 
tract useful information from on-line textual sources, and in some applications (e.g., 
a "related terms" thesaurus for full text information retrieval) may provide a useful 
way to heuristically organize sublanguage t rminology when human resources are 
unavailable. 
4. Semantic Type Induction from Syntactic Forms 
The purpose of the research described in this section is to experiment with the au- 
tomatic acquisition of semantic tags for words in a sublanguage, tags well beyond 
that available from the seeding of MRDs. The identification of semantic tags is the 
result of type coercion on known syntactic forms, to induce a semantic feature, such 
as \[+event\] or \[+object\]. 
4.1 Coercive Environments in Corpora 
A pervasive xample of type coercion is seen in the complements of aspectual verbs 
such as begin and finish, and verbs such as enjoy. That is, in sentences such as "John 
began the book," the normal complement expected is an action or event of some sort, 
most often expressed by a gerundive or infinitival phrase: "John began reading the 
book," "John began to read the book." In Pustejovsky (1991) it was argued that in such 
cases, the verb need not have multiple subcategorizations, butonly one deep semantic 
type, in this case, an event. Thus, the verb coerces its complement (e.g. "the book") 
into an event related to that object. Such information can be represented by means of 
a representational schema called qualia structure, which, among other things, specifies 
the relations associated with objects.

In related work being carried out with Mats Rooth of the University of Stuttgart, 
we are exploring what the range of coercion types is, and what environments hey 
may appear in, as discovered in corpora. Some of our initial data suggest hat the 
hypothesis of deep semantic selection may in fact be correct, as well as indicating 
what the nature of the coercion rules may be. Using techniques described in Church 
and Hindle (1990), Church and Hanks (1990), and Hindle and Rooth (1991), Figure 4 
shows some examples of the most frequent V-O pairs from the AP corpus. 
Corpus studies confirm similar results for "weakly intensional contexts" such as 
the complement of coercive verbs such as veto. These are interesting because regard- 
less of the noun type appearing as complement, it is embedded within a semantic 
interpretation f "the proposal to," thereby clothing the complement within an inten- 
sional context. The examples in Figure 5 with the verb veto indicate two things: first, 
that such coercions are regular and pervasive in corpora; second, that almost anything 
can be vetoed, but that the most frequently occurring objects are closest o the type 
selected by the verb. 
What these data show is that the highest count complement types match the type 
required by the verb; namely, that one vetoes a bill or proposal to do something, not 
the thing itself. These nouns can therefore be used with some predictive certainty for 
inducing the semantic type in coercive nvironments such as "veto the expedition." 
This work is still preliminary, however, and requires further examination (Pustejovsky 
and Rooth \[unpublished\]). 
4.2 Induction of Semantic Relations from Syntactic Forms 
In this section, we present another experiment indicating the feasibility of inducing 
semantic tags for lexical items from Corpora. 14 Imagine being able to take the V-O pairs 
14 This section presents an abridged version of material reported on in Pustejovsky (1992).

such as those given in Section 4.1, and then applying semantic tags to the verbs that 
are appropriate to the role they play for that object (i.e., induction of the qualia roles 
for that noun). This is similar to the experiment reported on in Section 3. Here we 
apply a similar technique to a much larger corpus, in order to induce the agentive role 
for nouns; that is, the semantic predicate associated with bringing about he object. 
In this example we look at the behavior of noun phrases and the prepositional 
phrases that follow them. In particular, we look at the co-occurrence ofnominals with 
between, with, and to. Table 1 shows results of the conflating noun plus preposition 
patterns. The percentage shown indicates the ratio of the particular collocation to the 
key word. Mutual information (MI) statistics for the two words in collocation are also 
shown. What these results indicate is that induction of semantic type from conflating 
syntactic patterns is possible. Based on the semantic types for these prepositions, the 
syntactic evidence suggests that there is an equivalence class where each preposition 
makes reference to a symmetric relation between the arguments in the following two 
patterns: 
? Z with y = ARzAx3y\ [Rz(x ,y)  A Rz(y, x)\] 
? Z between x and y= 
,XRz3x, y\[Rz(x, y)/x Rz(y, x)\] 
We then take these results and, for those nouns where the association ratios for N 
with and N between are similar, we pair them with the set of verbs governing these 
"NP PP" combinations in corpus, effectively partitioning the original V-O set into 
\[+agentive\] predicates and \[-agentive\] predicates. 
These are semantic n-grams rather than direct interpretations of the prepositions.

What these expressions in effect indicate is the range of semantic environments they 
will appear in. That is, in sentences like those in Example 16, the force of the relational 
nouns agreement and talks is that they are unsaturated for the predicate bringing about 
this relation. In 17, on the other hand, the NPs headed by agreement and talks are 
saturated in this respect. 
Example 16 
a. John made an agreement with Mary. 
b. Apple opened talks with IBM. 
Example 17 
a. This is an agreement between John and Mary. 
b. Those were the first talks between Apple and IBM. 
If our hypothesis is correct, we expect that verbs governing nominals collocated with 
a with-phrase will be mostly those predicates referring to the agentive quale of the 
nominal. This is because the with-phrase is unsaturated as a predicate, and acts to

identify the agent of the verb as its argument (cf. Nilsen (1973)). This is confirmed by 
our data, shown in Figure 6. 
Conversely, verbs governing nominals collocating with a between-phrase will not 
refer to the agentive since the phrase is saturated already. Indeed, the only verb occur- 
ring in this position with any frequency is the copula be, namely with the following 
counts: 12 be/V venture/0. Thus, weak semantic types can be induced on the basis 
of syntactic behavior. 
There is a growing literature on corpus-based acquisition and tuning (Smadja 
1991a; Zernik and Jacobs 1991; Brent 1991; as well as Grishman and Sterling 1992). 
We share with these researchers a general dependence on well-behaved collocational 
patterns and distributional structures. Probably the main distinguishing feature of our 
approach is its reliance on a fairly well studied semantic framework to aid and guide 
the semantic induction process itself, whether it involves selectional restrictions or 
semantic types. 
5. Lexical Presuppositions and Preferences 
In the previous ection we presented algorithms for extracting collocational informa- 
tion from corpora, in order to supplement and fine-tune the lexical structures eeded 
by a machine-readable dictionary. In this section we demonstrate hat, in addition to 
conventional lexical semantic relations, it is also possible to acquire information con- 
cerning lexical presuppositions and preferences from corpora, when analyzed with 
the appropriate semantic tools. In particular, we will discuss a phenomenon we call 
discourse polarity, and how corpus-based experiments provide clues toward the repre- 
sentation of this phenomenon, as well as information on preference relations. 
As we have seen, providing a representational system for lexical semantic relations 
is a nontrivial task. Representing presuppositional information, however, is even more 
daunting. Nevertheless, there are some systematic semantic generalizations a sociated 
with such subtle lexical inferences. To illustrate this, consider the following examples 
taken from the Wall Street Journal Corpus, involving the verb insist. 
Example 18 
But Mr. Fourtou insisted that the restructuring plans hadn't played a role in his decision. 
349 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
Example 19 
But so far, the majority is insisting that a daily paper in the home is an essential 
educational resource that Mr. Oshry must have, like it or not. 
Example 20 
But Mr. Nishi insists there is a common theme to his scattered projects: to improve 
and spread personal computers. 
Example 21 
"Mister, Djemaa is a crazy place for you," insists the first of many young men, clutching 
a visitor's sleeve. 
Example 22 
But the BNL sources yesterday insisted that the head office was aware of only a small 
portion of the credits to Iraq made by Atlanta. 
Example 23 
Mr. Smale, who ordinarily insists on a test market before a national roll-out, told the 
team to go ahead--a l though he said he was skeptical that Pringle's could survive, Mr. 
Tucker says. 
Example 24 
The Cantonese insist that their fish be "fresh," though one whiff of Hong Kong harbor 
and the visitor may yearn for something shipped from distant seas. 
Example 25 
Money isn't the issue, Mr. Bush insists. 
From analyzing these and similar data, a pattern emerges concerning the use of verbs 
like insist in discourse; namely, the co-occurrence with discourse markers denoting 
negative affect, such as although and but, as well as literal negatives, e.g., no and not. 
This is reminiscent of the behavior of negative polarity items such as any more and at all. 
Such lexical items occur only in the context of negatives within a certain structural 
configuration. 15 In a similar way, verbs such as insist seem to require an overt or 
implicit negation within the immediate discourse context, rather than within the clause. 
For this reason, we will call such verbs discourse polarity items. 
For our purposes, the significance of such data is twofold: first, experiments on 
corpora can test and confirm linguistic intuitions concerning a subtle semantic judg- 
ment; second, if such knowledge is in fact so systematic, then it must be at least 
partially represented in the lexical semantics of the verb. 
To test whether the intuitions supported by the above data could be confirmed 
in corpora, Bergler (1991) derived the statistical co-occurrence of insist with discourse 
polarity markers in the 7 mill ion-word corpus of Wall Street Journal articles. She derived 
the statistics reported in Figure 7. 
Let us assume, on the basis of this preliminary data 16 presented in Bergler (1992) 
that these verbs in fact do behave as discourse polarity items. The question then 
15 There is a rich literature on this topic. For discussion see Ladusaw (1980) and Linebarger (1980). 
16 Overlap between the categories occurs in less than 35 cases.

immediately arises as to how we represent this type of knowledge. Using the language 
of the qualia structure discussed above, we can make explicit reference to the polarity 
behavior, in the following informal but intuitive representation for the verb insist. 17 
insist(x:ind,y:prop) \] 
FORMAL = REPORTING-VERB--LCP 
TELIC = say(x,true(y)) & presupposed(~b) & y = ~b 
This entry states that in the REPORTING-VERB sense of the word, insist is a relation 
between an individual and a statement that is the negation of a proposition, ~b, pre- 
supposed in the context of the utterance. As argued in Pustejovsky (1991) and Miller 
and Fellbaum (1991), such simple oppositional predicates form a central part of our 
lexicalization of concepts. Semantically motivated collocations uch as these extracted 
from large corpora can provide presupposit ional information for words that would 
otherwise be missing from the lexical semantics of an entry. While full automatic ex- 
traction of semantic collocations is not yet feasible, some recent research in related 
areas is promising. 
Hindle (1990) reports interesting results of this kind based on literal collocations, 
where he parses the corpus (Hindle 1983) into predicate-argument structures and 
applies a mutual information measure (Fano 1961; Magerman and Marcus 1990) to weigh 
the association between the predicate and each of its arguments. For example, as a 
list of the most frequent objects for the verb drink in his corpus, Hindle found beer, 
tea, Pepsi, and champagne. Based on the distributional hypothesis that the degree of 
shared contexts is a similarity measure for words, he develops a similarity metric 
for nouns based on their substitutability in certain verb contexts. Hindle thus finds 
sets of semantically similar nouns based on syntactic co-occurrence data. The sets 
he extracts are promising; for example, the ten most similar nouns to treaty in his

This work is very close in spirit to our own investigation here; the emphasis on 
syntactic o-occurrence enables Hindle to extract his similarity lists automatically; they

are therefore asy to compile for different corpora, different sublanguages, etc. Here 
we are attempting to use these techniques together with a model of lexical meaning, 
to capture deeper lexical semantic ollocations; e.g., the generalization that the list of 
objects occurring for the word drink contains only liquids. 
In the final part of this section, we turn to how the analysis of corpora can provide 
lexical semantic preferences for verb selection. As discussed above, there is a growing 
body of research on deriving collocations from corpora (cf. Church and Hanks 1990; 
Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder 1990; Wilks et al 1993; Smadja 1991a, 1991b; Cal- 
zolari and Bindi 1990). Here we employ the tools of semantic analysis from Section 1 
to examine the behavior of metonymy with reporting verbs. We will show, on the ba- 
sis of corpus analysis, how verbs display marked differences in the ability to license 
metonymic operations over their arguments. Such information, we argue, is part of 
the preference semantics for a sublanguage, asautomatically derived from corpus. 
Metonymy can be seen as a case of "licensed violation" of selectional restric- 
tions. For example, while the verb announce selects for a human subject, sentences like 
The Phantasie Corporation announced third quarter losses are not only an acceptable para- 
phrase of the selectionally correct form Mr. Phantasie Jr. announced third quarter losses 
for Phantasie Corp, but they are the preferred form in the Wall Street Journal). This is an 
example of subject ype coercion, as discussed in Section 1. For example, the qualia 
structure for a noun such as corporation might be represented asbelow: 
corporation(x) 
CONST = group(y),spokesperson(w),executive(z) 
FORMAL = organization(x) 
TELIC = execute(z, decisions) 
AGENTIVE = incorporate(y,x) 
The metonymic extension i  this example is straightforward: a spokesman, executive, 
or otherwise legitimate representative "speaking for" a company or institution can be 
metonymically replaced by that company or institution. TM 
We find that this type of metonymic extension for the subject is natural and indeed 
very frequent with reporting verbs Bergler (1991), such as announce, report, release, and 
claim, while it is in general not possible with other verbs selecting human subjects, e.g., 
the verbs of contemplation (such as contemplate, consider, and think). However, there 
are subtle differences in the occurrence of such metonymies for the different members 
of the same semantic verb class that arise from corpus analysis. 
A reporting verb is an utterance verb that is used to relate the words of a source. In 
a careful study of seven reporting verbs on a 250,000-word corpus of Time magazine 
articles from 1963, we found that the preference for different metonymic extensions 
varies considerably within this field (Bergler 1991). Figure 8 shows the findings for the 
words insist, deny, admit, claim, announce, said, and told for two metonymic extensions, 
namely where a group stands for an individual (Analysts aid... ) and where a company 
or other institution stands for the individual (IBM announced ... ).19 
The difference in patterns of metonymic behavior is quite striking: semantically 
similar verbs seem to pattern similarly over all three categories; admit, insist, and deny 
show a closer resemblance to each other than to any of the others, while said and 
18 Note, however, that the metonymic extension is not quite as simple as extending from any employee to 
the whole company or institution, but that a form of legitimation has to be involved.) For more detail 
see Bergler (1992). 
19 The data for Figure 8 have been screened to ensure that only occurrences that constitute reporting 
contexts were used.

told form a category by themselves. There may be a purely semantic explanation why 
said and told seem not to prefer the metonymic use in subject position; e.g., perhaps 
these verbs relate more closely to the act of uttering, or perhaps they are too informal, 
stylistically. Evidence from other corpora, however, suggests that such information is 
accurately characterized as lexical preference. An initial experiment on a subset of the 
Wall Street Journal Corpus, for example, shows that said has a quite different metonymic 
distribution there, reported in Figure 9. 
In this corpus we discovered that subject selection for an individual person ap- 
peared in only 50% of the sentences, while a company/institution appeared in 34% 
of the cases. This difference could either be attributed to a difference in style between 
Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal or perhaps to a difference in general usage 
between 1963 and 1989. The statistics presented here can of course not determine the 
reason for the difference, but rather help establish the lexical semantic preferences that 
exist in a certain corpus and sublanguage. 
An important question related to the extraction of preference information is what 
the corpus should be. Recent effort has been spent constructing balanced corpora, con- 
taining text from different styles and sources, such as novels, newspaper texts, scien- 
tific journal articles, etc. The assumption is of course that given a representative mix of 
samples of language use, we can extract he general properties and usage of words. 
But if we gain access to sophisticated automatic orpus analysis tools such as those 
353 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
discussed above, and indeed if we have specialized algorithms for sublanguage ex- 
traction, then homogeneous corpora might provide better data. The few examples of 
lexical preference mentioned in this section might not tell us anything conclusive for 
the definitive usage of a word such as said, if there even exists such a notion. Nev- 
ertheless the statistics provide an important tool for text analysis within the corpus 
from which they are derived. Because we can systematically capture the violation of 
selectional restrictions (as semantically predicted), there is no need for a text analy- 
sis system to perform extensive commonsense inferencing. Thus, such presupposition 
and preference statistics are vital to efficient processing of real text. 
6. Summary and Discussion 
In this paper we have presented a particularly directed program of research for how 
text corpora can contribute to linguistics and computational linguistics. We first pre- 
sented a representation language for lexical knowledge, the generative l xicon, and 
demonstrated how it facilitates the structuring of lexical relations among words, look- 
ing in particular at the problems of metonymy and polysemy. 
Such a framework for lexical knowledge suggests that there are richer relation- 
ships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence that can be extracted 
automatically. The work suggests how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and 
polysemy might be exploited for knowledge acquisition for lexical items. Unlike purely 
statistical collocational nalyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the auto- 
matic construction of predictions about deeper semantic relationships among words 
appearing in collocational systems. 
We illustrated the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several 
classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures ac- 
quired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary. In addition to conven- 
tional lexical semantic relations, we then showed how information concerning lexical 
presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when 
analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools. 
In conclusion, we feel that the application of computational resources to the anal- 
ysis of text corpora has and will continue to have a profound effect on the direction 
of linguistic and computational linguistic research. Unlike previous attempts at cor- 
pus research, the current focus is supported and guided by theoretical tools, and not 
merely statistical techniques. We should furthermore welcome the ability to expand 
the data set used for the confirmation of linguistic hypotheses. At the same time, we 
must remember that statistical results themselves reveal nothing, and require careful 
and systematic nterpretation by the investigator to become linguistic data.
