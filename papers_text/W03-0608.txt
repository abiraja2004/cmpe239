Abstract
We study the problem of learning to recognise
objects in the context of autonomous agents.
We cast object recognition as the process of
attaching meaningful concepts to specific re-
gions of an image. In other words, given a
set of images and their captions, the goal is to
segment the image, in either an intelligent or
naive fashion, then to find the proper mapping
between words and regions. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a model that learns spatial re-
lationships between individual words not only
provides accurate annotations, but also allows
one to perform recognition that respects the
real-time constraints of an autonomous, mobile
robot.
1 Introduction
In writing this paper we hope to promote a discussion on
the design of an autonomous agent that learns semantic
associations in its environment or, more precisely, that
learns to associate regions of images with discrete con-
cepts. When an image region is labeled with a concept
in an appropriate and consistent fashion, we say that the
object has been recognised (Duygulu et al, 2002). We
use our laboratory robot, Jose? (Elinas et al, 2002), as a
prototype, but the ideas presented here extend to a wide
variety of settings and agents.
Before we proceed, we must elucidate on the require-
ments for achieving semantic learning in an autonomous
agent context.
Primarily, we need a model that learns associations be-
tween objects given a set of images paired with user in-
put. Formally, the task is to find a function that separates
the space of image patch descriptions into nw semantic
concepts, where nw is the total number of concepts in the
Figure 1: The image on the left is Jose? (Elinas et al,
2002), the mobile robot we used to collect the image data.
The images on the right are examples the robot has cap-
tured while roaming in the lab, along with labels used for
training. We depict image region annotations in later fig-
ures, but we emphasize that the robot receives only the
labels as input for training. That is, the robot does not
know what words correspond to the image regions.
training set (from now on we use the word ?patch? to re-
fer to a contiguous region in an image). These supplied
concepts could be in the form of text captions, speech,
or anything else that might convey semantic information.
For the time being, we restrict the set of concepts to En-
glish nouns (e.g. ?face?, ?toothbrush?, ?floor?). See Fig-
ure 1 for examples of images paired with captions com-
posed of nouns. Despite this restriction, we still leave
ourselves open to a great deal of ambiguity and uncer-
tainty, in part because objects can be described at several
different levels of specificity, and at the same level us-
ing different words (e.g. is it ?sea?, ?ocean?, ?wave? or
?water??). Ideally, one would like to impose a hierarchy
of lexical concepts, as in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). We
have yet to explore WordNet for our proposed framework,
though it has been used successfully for image clustering
(Barnard et al, 2001; Barnard et al, 2002).
Image regions, or patches, are described by a set of
low-level features such as average and standard deviation
of colour, average oriented Gabor filter responses to rep-
resent texture, and position in space. The set of patch
descriptions forms an nf -dimensional space of real num-
bers, where nf is the number of features. Even complex
low-level features are far from adequate for the task of
classifying patches as objects ? at some point we need
to move to representations that include high-level infor-
mation. In this paper we take a small step in that direction
since our model learns spatial relations between concepts.
Given the uncertainty regarding descriptions of objects
and their corresponding concepts, we further require that
the model be probabilistic. In this paper we use Bayesian
techniques to construct our object recognition model.
Implicitly, we need a thorough method for decompos-
ing an image into conceptually contiguous regions. This
is not only non-trivial, but also impossible without con-
sidering semantic associations. This motivates the seg-
mentation of images and learning associations between
patches and words as tightly coupled processes.
The subject of segmentation brings up another impor-
tant consideration. A good segmentation algorithm such
as Normalized Cuts (Shi and Malik, 1997) can take on the
order of a minute to complete. For many real-time appli-
cations this is an unaffordable expense. It is important
to abide by real-time constraints in the case of a mobile
robot, since it has to simultaneously recognise and nego-
tiate obstacles while navigating in its environment. Our
experiments suggest that the costly step of a decoupled
segmentation can be avoided without imposing a penalty
to object recognition performance.
Autonomous semantic learning must be considered a
supervised process or, as we will see later on, a partially-
supervised process since the associations are made from
the perspective of humans. This motivates a second re-
quirement: a system for the collection of data, ideally in
an on-line fashion. As mentioned above, user input could
come in the form of text or speech. However, the col-
lection of data for supervised classification is problem-
atic and time-consuming for the user overseeing the au-
tonomous agent, since the user is required to tediously
feed the agent with self-annotated regions of images. If
we relax our requirement on training data acquisition by
requesting captions at an image level, not at a patch level,
the acquisition of labeled data is suddenly much less chal-
lenging. Throughout this paper, we use manual annota-
tions purely for testing only ? we emphasize that the
training data includes only the labels paired with images.
We are no longer exploring object recognition as a
strict classification problem, and we do so at a cost since
we are no longer blessed with the exact associations be-
tween image regions and nouns. As a result, the learning
problem is now unsupervised. For a single training im-
age and a particular word token, we must now learn both
the probability of generating that word given an object
description and the correct association to one of the re-
gions with the image. Fortunately, there is a straightfor-
ward parallel between our object recognition formulation
and the statistical machine translation problem of build-
ing a lexicon from an aligned bitext (Brown et al, 1993;
Al-Onaizan et al, 1999). Throughout this paper, we rea-
son about object recognition with this analogy in mind
(Duygulu et al, 2002).
What other requirements should we consider? Since
our discussion involves autonomous agents, we should
pursue a dynamic data acquisition model. We can con-
sider the problem of learning an object recognition model
as an on-line conversation between the robot and the user,
and it follows the robot should be able to participate. If
the agent ventures into ?unexplored territory?, we would
like it to make unprompted requests for more assistance.
One could use active learning to implement a scheme for
requesting user input based on what information would
be most valuable to classification. This has yet to be ex-
plored for object recognition, but it has been applied to
the related domain of image retrieval (Tong and Chang,
2001). Additionally, the learning process could be cou-
pled with reinforcement ? in other words, the robot
could offer hypotheses for visual input and await feed-
back from user.
In the next section, we outline our proposed contextual
translation model. In Section 3, we weigh the merits of
several different error measures for the purposes of eval-
uation. The experimental results on the robot data are
given in Section 4. We leave discussion of results and
future work to the final section of this paper.
Figure 2: The alignment variables represent the corre-
spondences between label words and image patches. In
this example, the correct association is an2 = 4.
2 A contextual translation model for
object recognition
In this paper, we cast object recognition as a machine
translation problem, as originally proposed in (Duygulu
et al, 2002). Essentially, we translate patches (regions
of an image) into words. The model acts as a lexicon, a
dictionary that predicts one representation (words) given
another representation (patches). First we introduce some
notation, and then we build a story for our proposed prob-
abilistic translation model.
We consider a set of N images paired with their
captions. Each training example n is composed of
a set of patches {bn1, ..., bnMn} and a set of words
{wn1, ..., wnLn}. Mn is the number of patches in image
n and Ln is the number of words in the image?s caption.
Each bnj Rnf is a vector containing a set of feature val-
ues representing colour, texture, position, etc, where nf is
the number of features. For each patch bnj , our objective
is to align it to a word from the attached caption. We rep-
resent this unknown association by a variable anj , such
that ainj = 1 if bnj translates to wni; otherwise, ainj = 0.
Therefore, p(ainj) , p(anj = i) is the probability that
patch bnj is aligned with word wni in document n. See
Figure 2 for an illustration. nw is the total number of
word tokens in the training set.
We construct a joint probability over the translation pa-
rameters and latent alignment variables in such a way that
maximizing the joint results in what we believe should be
the best object recognition model (keeping in mind the
limitations placed by our set of features!). Without loss
of generality, the joint probability is
p(b,a|w) =
N?
n=1
Mn?
j=1
p(anj |an,1:j?1, bn,1:j?1,wn, ?)
? p(bnj |an,1:j , bn,1:j?1,wn, ?) (1)
where wn denotes the set of words in the nth caption,
an,1:j?1 is the set of latent alignments 1 to j?1 in image
n, bn,1:j?1 is the set of patches 1 to j? 1, and ? is the set
of model parameters.
Generally speaking, alignments between words and
patches depend on all the other alignments in the im-
age, simply because objects are not independent of
each other. These dependencies are represented ex-
plicitly in equation 1. However, one usually assumes
p(anj |an,1:j?1, bn,1:j?1,wn, ?) = p(anj = i|wn, ?) to
guarantee tractability. In this paper, we relax the indepen-
dence assumption in order to exploit spatial context in im-
ages and words. We allow for interactions between neigh-
bouring image annotations through a pairwise Markov
random field (MRF). That is, the probability of a patch
being aligned to a particular word depends on the word
assignments of adjacent patches in the image. It is rea-
sonable to make the assumption that given the alignment
for a particular patch, translation probability is indepen-
dent from the other patch-word alignments. A simplified
version of the graphical model for illustrative purposes is
shown in Figure 3.

the model parameters. Lines represent the undirected de-
pendencies between variables. The potential ? controls
the consistency between annotations, while the potentials

In Figure 3, the potentials ?nj , p(bnj |w?) are
the patch-to-word translation probabilities, where w?
denotes a particular word token. We assign a Gaus-
sian distribution to each word token, so p(bnj |w?) =
N (bnj ;?w? ,?w?). The potential ?(anj , ank) encodes
the compatibility of the two alignments, anj and ank.
The potentials are the same for each image. That is, we
use a single W ?W matrix ?, where W is the number of
word tokens. The final joint probability is a product of the
translation potentials and the inter-alignment potentials:

where ?w?(wni) = 1 if the ith word in the nth caption is
the word w?; otherwise, it is 0.
To clarify the unsupervised model described up to
this point, it helps to think in terms of counting word-
to-patch alignments for updating the model parameters.
Loosely speaking, we update the translation parameters
?w? and ?w? by counting the number of times partic-
ular patches are aligned with word w?. Similarly, we
update ?(w?, w) by counting the number of times the
word tokensw? andw are found in adjacent patch align-
ments. We normalize the latter count by the overall align-
ment frequency to prevent counting alignment frequen-
cies twice.
In addition, we use a hierarchical Bayesian scheme to
provide regularised solutions and to carry out automatic
feature weighting or selection (Carbonetto et al, 2003).
In summary, our learning objective is to find good val-
ues for the unknown model parameters ? , {?,?, ?, ?},
where ? and ? are the means and covariances of the
Gaussians for each word, ? is the set of alignment po-
tentials and ? is the set of shrinkage hyper-parameters for
feature weighting. For further details on how to compute
the model parameters using approximate EM and loopy
belief propagation, we refer the reader to (Carbonetto et
al., 2003; Carbonetto and de Freitas, 2003)
3 Evaluation metric considerations
Before we discuss what makes a good evaluation met-
ric, it will help if we answer this question: ?what makes
a good image annotation?? As we will see, there is no
straightforward answer.
Figure 4: Examples of images which demonstrate that the
importance of concepts has little or no relation to the
area these concepts occupy. On the left, ?polar bear?
is at least pertinent as ?snow? even though it takes up
less area in the image. In the photograph on the right,
?train? is most likely the focus of attention.
It is fair to say that certain concepts in an image are
more prominent than others. One might take the approach
that objects that consume the most space in an image are
the most important, and this is roughly the evaluation cri-
terion used in previous papers (Carbonetto et al, 2003;
Carbonetto and de Freitas, 2003). Consider the image on
the left in Figure 4. We claim that ?polar bear? is at least
as important as snow. There is an easy way to test this
assertion ? pretend the image is annotated either entirely
as ?snow? or entirely as ?polar bear?. In our experience,
people find the latter annotation as appealing, if not more,
than the former. Therefore, one would conclude that it is
better to weight all concepts equally, regardless of size,
which brings us to the image on the right. If we treat
all words equally, having many words in a single label
obfuscates the goal of getting the most important con-
cept,?train?, correct.
Ideally, when collecting user-annotated images for the
purpose of evaluation, we should tag each word with a
weight to specify its prominence in the scene. In practice,
this is problematic because different users focus their at-
tention on different concepts, not to mention the fact that
it is an burdensome task.
For lack of a good metric, we evaluate the proposed
translation models using two error measures. Error mea-
sure 1 reports an error of 1 if the model annotation with
the highest probability results in an incorrect patch anno-
tation. The error is averaged over the number of patches
in each image, and then again over the number of images
in the data set. Error measure 2 is similar, only we av-
erage the error over the patches corresponding to word
(according to the manual annotations). The equations are
given by

where Pni is the set of patches in image n that are
manually-annotated using word i, a?nj is the model align-
ment with the highest probability, a?nj is the provided
?true? annotation, and ?a?nj (a?nj) is 1 if a?nj = a?nj .
Our intuition is that the metric where we weight all
concepts equally, regardless of size, is better overall. As
we will see in the next section, our translation models do
not perform as well under this error measure. This is due
to the fact that the joint probability shown in equation 1
maximises the first error metric, not the second. Since the
agent cannot know the true annotations beforehand, it is
difficult to construct a model that maximises the second
error measure, but we are currently pursuing approxima-
tions to this metric.
4 Experiments
We built a data set by having Jose? the robot roam around
the lab taking pictures, and then having laboratory mem-
bers create captions for the data using a consistent set of
words. For evaluation purposes, we manually annotated
the images. The robomedia data set is composed of 107
training images and 43 test images 1. The training and
test sets contain a combined total of 21 word tokens. The
word frequencies in the labels and manual annotations are
shown in figure 5.
In our experiments, we consider two scenarios. In the
first, we use Normalized Cuts (Shi and Malik, 1997) to
segment the images into distinct patches. In the second
scenario, we take on the object recognition task with-
out the aid of a sophisticated segmentation algorithm,
and instead construct a uniform grid of patches over the
image. Examples of different segmentations are shown
along with the anecdotal results in Figure 8. For the crude
segmentation, we used patches of height and width ap-
proximately 1/6th the size of the image. We found that
smaller patches introduced too much noise to the features
and resulted in poor test performance, and larger patches
contained too many objects at once. In future work, we

notated patch, in the robomedia training and test sets.
The final two columns show the precision of the transla-
tion model tMRF using the grid segmentation for each
token, averaged over the 12 trials. Precision is defined
as the probability the model?s prediction is correct for a
particular word and patch. Since precision is 1 minus
the error of equation 3, the total precision on both the
training and test sets matches the average performance
of tMRF-patch on Error measure 2, as shown in in Fig-
ure 7. While not presented in the table, the precision on
individual words varies significantly from one one trial to
the next. Note that some words do not appear in both the
training and test sets, hence the n/a.

age labels. We provide this information for completeness.

will investigate a hierarchical patch representation to take
into account both short and long range patch interactions,
as in (Freeman and Pasztor, 1999).
We compare two models. The first is the translation
model where dependencies between alignments are re-
moved for the sake of tractability, called tInd. The second
is the translation model in which we assume dependences

mates generic object recognition.
between adjacent alignments in the image. This model
is denoted by tMRF. We represent the sophisticated and
crude segmentation scenarios by -seg and -patch, respec-
tively.
One admonition regarding the evaluation procedure: a
translation is deemed correct if at least one of the patches
corresponds to the model?s prediction. In a manner of
speaking, when a segment encompasses several concepts,
we are giving the model the benefit of the doubt. For
example, according to our evaluation the annotations for
both the grid and Normalized Cuts segmentations shown
in Figure 6 correct. However, from observation the grid
segmentation provides a more precise object recognition.
As a result, evaluation can be unreliable when Normal-
ized Cuts offers poor segmentations. It is also important
to remember that the true result images shown in the sec-
ond column of Figure 8 are idealisations.
Experimental results on 12 trials are shown in Figure
7, and selected annotations predicted by the tMRF model
on the test set are shown in Figure 8. The most signif-
icant result is that the contextual translation model per-
forms the best overall, and performs equally well when
supplied with either Normalized Cuts or a naive segmen-
tations. We stress that even though the models trained
using both the grid and Normalized Cuts segmentations
are displayed on the same plots, in Figure 6 we indi-
cate that object recognition using the grid segmentation is
generally more precise, given the same evaluation result
in Figure 7. Learning contextual dependencies between
alignment appears to improve performance, despite the
large amount of noise and the increase in the number of
model parameters that have to be learned. The contex-

tual model also tends to produce more visually appeal-
ing annotations since they the translations smoothed over
neighbourhoods of patches.
The performance of the contextual translation model
on individual words on the training and test sets is shown
in Figure 5, averaged over the trials. Since our approx-
imate EM training a local maximum point estimate for
the joint posterior and the initial model parameters are
set to random values, we obtain a great deal of variance
from one trial to the next, as observed in the Box-and-
Whisker plots in Figure 7. While not shown in Figure
5, we have noticed considerable variation in what words
are predicted with high precision. For example, the word
?ceiling? is predicted with an average success rate of
0.347, although the precision on individual trials ranges
from 0 to 0.842.

show our model?s predictions using both sophisticated and crude segmentations. The ?true? annotations are shown in
the second column. Notice that the annotations using Normalized Cuts tend to be more visually appealing compared
to the rectangular grid, but intuition is probably misleading: the error measures in Figure 7 demonstrate that both
segmentations produce equally accurate results. It is also important to note that these annotations are probabilistic;
for clarity we only display results with the highest probability.
From the Bayesian feature weighting priors ? placed
on the word cluster means, we can deduce the relative
importance of our feature set. In our experiments, lumi-
nance and vertical position in the image are the two most
important features.
5 Discussion and conclusion
Our experiments suggest that we can eliminate the costly
step of segmentation without incurring a penalty to the
object recognition task. This realisation allows us to re-
move the main computational bottleneck and pursue real-
time learning in a mobile robot setting. Moreover, by in-
troducing spatial relationships into the model, we main-
tain a degree of consistency between individual patch an-
notations. We can consider this to be an early form of
segmentation that takes advantage of both high-level and
low-level information. Thus, we are solving both the
segmentation and recognition problems simultaneously.
However, we emphasize the need for further investiga-
tion to pin down the role of segmentation in the image
translation process.
Our translation model is disposed to predicting certain
words better than others. However, at this point we can-
not make make any strong conclusions as to why certain
words easy to classify (e.g. cabinets), while others are
difficult (e.g. filers). From Figure 5, it appears to be the
case that words that occur frequently and possess a con-
sistent set of features tend to be more easily classified.
Initially, we were doubtful that spatial context in the
model would improve results given that the robot roams
in a fairly homogeneous environment. This contrasts with
experiments on the Corel data sets (Carbonetto and de
Freitas, 2003), whereby the photographs were captured
from a wide variety of settings. However, the experi-
ments on the robomedia data demonstrate that there is
something to be gained by introducing inter-alignment
dependencies in the model, even in environments with
relatively noisy and unreliable data.
Generic object recognition in the context of robotics
is a challenging task. Standard low-level features such
as colour and texture are particularly ineffective in a lab-
oratory environment. For example, chairs can come in a
variety of shapes and colours, and ?wall? refers to a verti-
cal surface that has virtually no relation to colour, texture
and position. Moreover, it is much more difficult to de-
lineate specific concepts in a scene, even for humans ?
does a table include the legs, and where does one draw
the line between shelves, drawers, cabinets and the ob-
jects contained in them? (This explains why many of the
manually-annotated patches in Figures 6 and 8 are left
empty.) Object recognition on the Corel data set is com-
paratively easy because the photos are captured to arti-
ficially delineate specific concepts. Colour and texture
tend to be more informative in natural scenes.
In order to tackle concerns mentioned above, one ap-
proach would be to construct a more sophisticated repre-
sentation of objects. A more realistic alternative would be
to reinforce our representation with high-level features,
including more complex spatial relations.
One important criterion we did not address explicitly
is on-line learning. Presently, we train our models as-
suming that all the images are collected at one time. Re-
search shows that porting batch learning to an on-line
process using EM does not pose significant challenges
(Smith and Makov, 1978; Sato and Ishii, 2000; Brochu et
al., 2003). With the discussion presented in this paper in
mind, real-time interactive learning of semantic associa-
tions in Jose??s environment is very much within reach.
