Abstract
We describe a cross-lingual method for the in-
duction of selectional preferences for resource-
poor languages, where no accurate monolin-
gual models are available. The method uses
bilingual vector spaces to ?translate? foreign
language predicate-argument structures into
a resource-rich language like English. The
only prerequisite for constructing the bilin-
gual vector space is a large unparsed corpus
in the resource-poor language, although the
model can profit from (even noisy) syntactic
knowledge. Our experiments show that the
cross-lingual predictions correlate well with
human ratings, clearly outperforming monolin-
gual baseline models.
1 Introduction
Selectional preferences capture the empirical observa-
tion that not all words are equally good arguments to
a given verb in a particular argument position (Wilks,
1975; Resnik, 1996). For instance, the subjects of
the English verb to shoot are generally people, while
the direct objects can be people or animals. This is
reflected in speakers? intuitions. Table 1 shows that
the combination the hunter shot the deer is judged
more plausible than the deer shot the hunter. Selec-
tional preferences do not only play an important role
in human sentence processing (McRae et al, 1998),
but are also helpful for NLP tasks like word sense
disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and
semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
Computational models of selectional preferences
predict such plausibilities for triples of a predicate p,
an argument position a, and a head word h, such as
Predicate Relation Noun Plausibility
shoot subject hunter 6.9
shoot object hunter 2.8
shoot subject deer 1.0
shoot object deer 6.4
Table 1: Predicate-relation-noun triples with human plau-
sibility judgments on a 7-point scale (McRae et al, 1998)
(shoot,object,hunter). All recent models take a two-
step approach: (1), they extract all triples (p, a, h)
from a large corpus; (2), they apply some type of
generalization to make predictions for unseen items.
Clearly, the accuracy of these models relies crucially
on the quality and coverage of the extracted triples,
and thus on the syntactic analysis of the corpus. Un-
fortunately, corpora that are both large enough and
have a very good syntactic analysis are only available
for a handful of Western and Asian languages, which
leaves all other languages without reliable selectional
preference models.
In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual knowl-
edge transfer approach to this problem: We automat-
ically translate triples (p, a, h) from resource-poor
languages into English, where large and high-quality
parsed corpora are available and we can compute a
reliable plausibility estimate. The translations are
extracted from a bilingual semantic space, which can
be constructed via bootstrapping from large unparsed
corpora in the two languages, without the need for
parallel corpora or bilingual lexical resources.
Structure of the paper. Section 2 reviews models
for selectional preferences. In Section 3, we describe
our approach. Section 4 introduces our experimental
setup, and Sections 5 and 6 present and discuss our
experiments. Section 7 wraps up.

2 Selectional Preferences
The first broad-coverage model of selectional prefer-
ences was developed by Resnik (1996). To estimate
the plausibility of a triple (p, a, h), Resnik first ex-
tracted all head words seen with predicate p in posi-
tion a, Seena(p), from a corpus. He then used the
WordNet hierarchy to generalize over the head words
and to create predictions for unseen ones. A number
of studies has followed the same approach, exploring
different ways of using the structure of WordNet (Abe
and Li, 1996; Clark and Weir, 2002). While these
approaches show good results, they can only make
predictions for argument heads that are covered by
WordNet. This is already a problem for English, and
much more so in other languages, where comparable
resources are often much smaller or entirely absent.
A promising alternative approach is to derive
the generalizations from distributional informa-
tion (Prescher et al, 2000; Pad? et al, 2007; Bergsma
et al, 2008). For example, the Pad? et al (2007)
model computes vector space representations for all
head words h and defines the plausibility of the triple
(p, a, h) as a weighted mean of the vector space simi-
larities between h and all h? in Seena(p):
Pl(p, a, h) =
?
h??Seena(p)
w(h?)? sim(h, h?)
?
h? w(h
?)
(1)
where w(h?) is a weight, typically frequency.
In this model, the generalization is provided by dis-
tributional similarity, which can be computed from a
large corpus, without the need for additional lexical
resources. Pad? et al found it to outperform Resnik?s
approach in an evaluation against human plausibility
judgments. However, note that competitive results
are only obtained by representing the head words in
?syntactic? vector spaces whose dimensions consist
of context words with their syntactic relation to the
target rather than just context words. This is not sur-
prising: Presumably, hunter and deer share a domain
and are likely to have similar word-based context
distributions, even though they differ with regard to
their plausibility for particular predicate-argument
positions. Only when the vector space can capture
their different syntactic co-occurrence patterns can
the model predict different plausibilities.

3 Cross-lingual selectional preferences
In order to compute reliable selectional preference
representations, distributional models need to see
at least some head words for each (p, a) combina-
tion. Manually annotated treebank corpora, which
are becoming available for an increasing number of
languages, are too small for this task. We therefore
explore the idea of predicting the selectional pref-
erences for such languages by taking advantage of
large corpora with high-quality syntactic analyses in
resource-rich languages like English. This idea falls
into the general approach of cross-lingual knowledge
transfer (see e.g. Hwa et al, 2005). The application
to selectional preferences was suggested by Agirre et
al. (2003), who demonstrated its feasibility by man-
ual translation between Basque and English. We
extend their experiments to an automatic model that
predicts plausibility judgments in a resource-poor
language (source language) by exploiting a model in
a resource-rich language (target language).
Figure 1 sketches our method. We assume that
there is not enough high-quality data to build a mono-
lingual selectional preference model for the source
language (shown by dotted lines). However, we can
use a bilingual vector space, that is, a semantic space
in which words of both the source and the target
language are represented, to translate each source
language word s into the target language by identify-
ing its nearest (most similar) target word tr(s):
tr(s) = argmaxt sim(s, t) (2)
Now we can use a target language selectional prefer-
ence model to obtain plausibilities for source triples:
Pls(p, a, h) = Plt(tr(p), a, tr(h)) (3)
where the superscript indicates the language.
922
Eq. (3) gives rise to three questions: (1), How can
we construct the bilingual space to model tr? (2), Is
translating actually the appropriate way of transfer-
ring selectional preferences? (3), Is it reasonable to
retain the source language argument positions like
subject or object? The following subsections discuss
(1) and (2); we will address (3) in Sections 5 and 6.
3.1 Bilingual Vector Spaces
Bilingual vector spaces are vector spaces in which
words from two languages are represented (cf. Fig. 2).
The dimensions of this space are labeled with bilin-
gual context word pairs (like secretly/heimlich and
rifle/Gewehr for German?English) that are mutual
translations. By treating such context word pairs as
single dimensions, the vector space can represent tar-
get words from both languages, counting the target
words? co-occurrences with the context words from
the respective language. In other words, a source-
target word pair (s, t) will be assigned similar vectors
in the semantic space if the context words of s are
translations of the context words of t. Cross-lingual
semantic similarity between words can be measured
using standard vector space similarity (Lee, 1999).
Importantly, bilingual vector spaces can be built
on the basis of co-occurrences drawn from two un-
related corpora for the source and target languages.
Their construction does not require resources such
as parallel corpora or bilingual translation lexicons,
which might not be available for resource-poor source
languages. Where parallel corpora exist, they often
cover specific domains (e.g., politics), while many
bilingual lexicons are prone to ambiguity problems.
The main challenge in constructing bilingual vec-
tor spaces is determining the set of dimensions,
i.e., bilingual word pairs, using as little knowledge as
possible. Most often, such pairs are extracted from
small bilingual lexicons (Fung and McKeown, 1997;
Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002). As
mentioned above, such resources might not be avail-
able. We thus follow an alternative approach by using
frequent cognates, words that are shared between the
two languages (Mark? et al, 2005). Cognates can
be extracted by simple string matching between the
corpora, and mostly share their meaning (Koehn and
Knight, 2002). However, they account for (at most) a
small percentage of all interesting translation pairs.

bilingual space, we use these cognates merely as a
starting point for a bootstrapping process: We build
a bilingual vector space with the initial word pairs as
dimensions, and identify nearest neighbors between
the two languages in the space. These are added as
dimensions of the bilingual space, and the process
is repeated. Since the focus is on identifying reli-
able source-target word pairs rather than complete
coverage as in Eq. (2), we adopt a symmetrical defi-
nition of translation that pairs up only mutual nearest
neighbors, and allows words to remain untranslated:1
trsym(s) = t iff tr(s) = t and tr(t) = s (4)
From the second iteration onward, this process intro-
duces dimensions that are not identical graphemes,
such as Kind?child and Geschwindigkeit?speed, and
is iterated until convergence. Since each word of
either language can only participate in at most one
dimension, dimensions acquired in later steps can cor-
rect wrong pairs from previous steps, like the ?false
friend? German Kind ?child? ? English kind, which
is part of the initial set of cognates.
3.2 Translation and Selectional Preferences
As Figure 1 shows, the easiest way of exploiting a
bilingual semantic space is to identify for each source
word the target language word with the highest se-
mantic similarity. For example, in Figure 2, the best
translation of German schie?en is its English nearest
neighbor, shoot. However, it is risky to rely on the
single nearest neighbor ? it might simply be wrong.
Even if it is correct, data sparsity is an issue: The
translations may be infrequent in the target language,
or the two translations of p and h may form unlikely
collocates for target language-internal reasons (like

most frequent of the trsym pairs. Frequency is defined as the
geometric mean of the two words? monolingual frequencies.
923
difference in register) that do not reflect plausibility.
A third issue are monolingual semantic phenomena
like polysemy and idioms: The implausible German
triple (schie?en,obj,Brise) will be judged as very plau-
sible due to the English idiom to shoot the breeze.
A look at the broader neighborhood of schie?en
suggests that its second and third-best English neigh-
bors, hit, and stalk, can be used to smooth plausibility
estimates for schie?en. Instead of translating source
language words by their single nearest neighbor, we
will take its k nearest neighbors into account. This
is defensible also from a more fundamental point of
view, which suggests that the cross-lingual transfer of
selectional preferences does not require literal trans-
lation in order to work. First, ontological models
like Resnik?s assume that synonymous words behave
similarly with respect to selectional preferences. Sec-
ond, recent work by Chambers and Jurafsky (2009)
has induced ?narrative chains?, i.e., likely sequences
of events, by their use of similar head words. Thus,
we expect that all k nearest neighbors of a source
predicate s are informative for the selectional prefer-
ences of s (like schie?en) as long as they are either
synonyms of its literal translation (shoot/hit) or come
from the same narrative chain (stalk/kill/. . . ).
It is also clear that smoothing does not always
equate better predictions. Closeness in a word-based
vector space can also just reflect semantic association.
For example, Spanish tenista ?tennis player? is highly
associated with English tennis, but is a bad translation
in terms of selectional preferences. We assume that
this problem is more acute for nouns than for verbs:
The context of verbs is dominated by their arguments,
which is not true for nouns. Consequently, close
nouns in vector space can differ widely in ontological
type, while close verbs generally have one or more
similar argument slots. In our model, we will thus
consider several verb translations, but just the best
head word translation. For details, see Section 5.
4 Experimental Setup
Our evaluation uses English as the target language
and two source languages: German (as a very close
neighbor of English) and Spanish (as a more distant
one). Neither of these languages are really resource-
poor, but they allow us to compare our cross-lingual
model against monolingual models, to emulate dif-
ferent levels of ?resource poorness? and to examine
the model?s learning curve.
Plausibility Data. For German, we used the plau-
sibility judgments collected by Brockmann (2002).
The dataset contains human judgments for ninety
triples sampled from the manually annotated 1 mil-
lion word TiGer corpus (Brants et al, 2002): ten
verbs with three argument positions (subject [SUBJ],
direct object [DOBJ], and oblique (prepositional) ob-
ject [POBJ]) combined with three head words. Mod-
els are evaluated against such datasets by correlating
predicted plausibilities with the (not normally dis-
tributed) human judgments using Spearman?s ?, a
non-parametric rank-order correlation coefficient.
We constructed a similar 90-triple data set for
Spanish by sampling triples from two Spanish cor-
pora (see below) using Brockmann?s (2002) crite-
ria. Human judgments for the triples were collected
through the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) crowd-
sourcing platform (Snow et al, 2008). We asked
native speakers of Spanish to rate the plausibility of
a simple sentence with the relevant verb-argument
combination on a five-point Likert scale, obtaining
between 12 and 17 judgments for each triple. For
each datapoint, we removed the single lowest and
highest judgments and computed the mean. We as-
sessed the reliability of our data by replicating Brock-
mann?s experiment for German with our AMT setup.
With a Spearman ? of almost .90, our own judgments
correlate very well with Brockmann?s original data.
Monolingual Prior Work and Baselines. For
German, Brockmann and Lapata (2003) evaluated
ontology-based models trained on TiGer triples and
the GermaNet ontology. The results in Table 2 show
that while both models are able to predict the data
significantly, neither of the models can predict all of
the data. We attribute this to the small size of TiGer.2
To gauge the limits of monolingual knowledge-
lean approaches, we constructed two monolingual
distributional models for German and Spanish ac-
cording to the Pad? et al (2007) model (Eq. (1)).
Recall that this model performs generalization in a
syntax-based vector space model. We computed vec-
tor spaces from dependency-parsed corpora for the

Schulte im Walde?s verb frame resource (Schulte im
Walde et al, 2001), which contains the frequency of
triples calculated from probabilistic parses of 30M
words from the Huge German Corpus (HGC) of
newswire. For Spanish, we consulted two syntac-
tically analyzed corpora: the AnCora (Taul? et al,
2008) and the Encarta corpus (Calvo et al, 2005). At
0.5M words, the AnCora corpus is small, but man-
ually annotated, whereas the larger, automatically
parsed Encarta corpus amounts to over 18M tokens.
Table 3 shows the results for the distributional
monolingual models. For German, we get significant
correlations for DOBJ and POBJ, an almost signif-
icant correlation for SUBJs, and high significance
for the complete dataset (p < 0.01). These figures
rival the performance of the ontological models (cf.
Table 2), without using ontological information. For
Spanish, the only significant correlation with human
judgments is obtained for subjects, the most frequent
argument position, with the clean AnCora data. An-
Cora is presumably too sparse for the other argument
positions. The large Encarta corpus, in turn, is very
noisy, supporting our concerns from Section 2.

Cross-lingual Selectional Preferences. Our archi-
tecture for the cross-lingual prediction of selectional
preferences shown in Figure 1 consists of two com-
ponents, namely the bilingual vector space and a
selectional preference model in the target language.
As our English selectional preference model, we
again use the Pad? et al (2007) model, trained on
a version of the BNC parsed with MINIPAR (Lin,
1993). The parameters of the syntactic vector space
were the same as for the monolingual baseline mod-
els. The bilingual vector spaces were constructed
from three large, unparsed, comparable monolin-
gual corpora. For German, we used the HGC de-
scribed above. For Spanish, we obtained a corpus
with around 100M words, consisting of 2.5 years of
crawled text from two major Spanish newspapers.
For English, we used the BNC.
We first constructed initial sets of bilingual labels.
For German?English, we identified 1064 graphem-
ically identical word pairs that occurred more than
4 times per million words. Due to the larger lex-
ical distance between Spanish and English, there
are fewer graphemically identical tokens for this lan-
guage pair. We therefore applied a Porter stemmer
and found 2104 identical stems, at a higher risk of
?false friends?. We then applied the bootstrapping
cycle from Section 3.1. The set of dimensions con-
verged after around five iterations.
We evaluated the (asymmetric) nearest neighbor
pairs from the final spaces, (s, tr(s)), against two
online dictionaries.4 Table 4 shows that 55% to 60%
of the pairs are listed in the dictionaries, with parallel
tendencies for both language pairs. The bilingual
space performs fairly well for nouns and adjectives,
but badly for verbs, which is a well-known weakness
of distributional models (Peirsman et al, 2008).
Even taking into account the incompleteness of
dictionaries, this looks like a negative result: more
relations rather than trees, we could not model the POBJ data.

than half of all verb translations are incorrect. How-
ever, following up on our intuitions from Section 3.2,
we performed an analysis of the ?incorrect? transla-
tions. It revealed that many of the errors in Table 4
are informative, semantically related words. Near-
est neighbor target language verbs in particular tend
to represent the same event type and take the same
kinds of arguments as the source verb. Examples
are German gef?hrden ?threaten? ? English affect,
and German Neugier ?curiosity? ? English enthusi-
asm. We concluded that literal translation quality is
a misleading figure of merit for our task.
Experimental rationale. Section 3 introduced one
major design decision of our model: the question of
how to treat the argument position, which cannot
be translated by the bilingual vector space, in the
cross-lingual transfer. We present two experiments
that investigate the model?s behavior in the absence
and presence of knowledge about argument positions.
Experiment 1 uses no syntactic knowledge about the
source language whatsoever. In this situation, the
best we can do is to assume that source language
argument positions like SUBJ will correspond to the
same argument position in the target language. Exper-
iment 2 attempts to identify, for each source language
argument position, the ?best fit? position in the target
language. This results in better plausibility estimates,
but also means that we need at least some syntac-
tic information about the source language. In both
experiments, we vary the number of translations we
consider for each verb.
5 Exp. 1: Induction without syntactic
knowledge in the source language
This experiment assumes that argument positions
simply carry over between languages. While this
assumption clearly simplifies linguistic reality, it has
the advantage of not needing any syntactic informa-
tion about the source language. We thus model Ger-
man and Spanish SUBJ relations by English SUBJ
relations and DOBJs by DOBJs. In the case of (lex-
icalized) POBJs, where we cannot assume identity,
we compute plausibility scores for all English POBJs
that account for at least 10% of the predicate?s ar-
gument tokens, and select the PP with the highest
plausibility estimate. The k best ?translations? of the
predicate p, trk(p), are turned into a single prediction
using maximization, yielding the final model:
Plsnosyn(p, a, h) = max
pt?trk(p)
Plt(pt, a, tr(h)) (5)
Note that this model does not use any source lan-
guage information, except the bilingual vector space.
The results of Experiment 1 are given in Table 5
(coverage always 100%). For German, all predictions
correlate significantly with human ratings, and most
even at p < 0.01, despite our naive assumption about
the cross-lingual argument position identity. The
results exceed both monolingual model types (onto-
logical, Tab. 2, and distributional, Tab. 3), notably
without the use of syntactic data. In particular, the
results for the POBJs, notoriously difficult to model
monolingually, are higher than for SUBJs or DOBJs.
We attribute this to the cross-lingual generalization
which takes all prepositional arguments into account.
The Spanish dataset is harder to model overall.
We obtain significantly high correlations for SUBJ,
but non-significant results for DOBJ and POBJ. This
corresponds well to the patterns for the monolingual
AnCora corpus (Table 3). However, we outperform
AnCora on the complete dataset, where it did not
achieve significance, while the cross-lingual model
does at p < 0.01 ? again, even without the use of
syntactic analyses. We attribute the overall lower
results compared to German to systematic syntactic
differences between English and Spanish. For exam-
ple, animate direct objects in Spanish are realized
as POBJs headed by the preposition a. Estimating
the plausibility of such objects by looking at English
POBJs is unlikely to yield good results. The use of
a larger number of verb translations yields a clear
increase in correlation for the German data, but in-
conclusive results for Spanish.
6 Exp. 2: Induction with syntactic
knowledge in the source language
As discussed in Section 3.2, verbs that are semanti-
cally similar in the bilingual vector space may very
well realize their (semantic) argument positions dif-
ferently in the surface syntax. For example, German
teilnehmen is correctly translated to English attend,
but the crucial event argument is realized differently,
namely as a POBJ headed by an in German and as
a DOBJ in English. To address this problem, we

learn a mapping function m that identifies the argu-
ment position at of a target language predicate pt
that corresponds best to an argument position a of a
predicate p in the source language. Our simple model
is in the same spirit as the cross-lingual plausibility
model itself: It returns the argument position at of
pt for which the seen head words of (p, a) are most
plausible when translated into the target language:5
m(p, a, pt) = argmax
at

Parallel to Eq. (5), the cross-lingual model is now:
Plssyn(p, a, h) = max
pt?trk(p)
Plt(pt,m(p, a, pt), tr(h))
(6)
This model can recover English argument positions
that correspond better to the original ones than the
identity mapping. For example, on our data, it discov-
ers the mapping for teilnehmen an/attend discussed
above. A second example concerns the incorrect, but
informative translation of stagnieren ?stagnate? as
boost. Here the model recognizes that the SUBJ of
stagnieren (the stagnating entity) corresponds to the
DOBJ of boost.
Establishing m requires syntactic information in
the source language, in order to obtain the set of
seen head words Seenas(ps). For this reason, Exp. 2
uses the parsed subset of the HGC (German), and the
AnCora and Encarta corpora (Spanish). The results
are shown in Table 6. We generally improve over

good results for the AnCora corpus. Compared to
Exp. 1, we see a slight degradation for the SUBJs;
however, the correlations remain significant for all
values of k. Conversely, all predictions for DOBJs
are now significant,6 and the POBJs have improved at
least numerically, which validates our analysis of the
problems in Exp. 1. The best correlation for the com-
plete dataset improves from .36 to .47. The results
for the Encarta corpus disappoint, though. SUBJs
are significant, but worse than for AnCora, and the
DOBJs remain non-significant throughout. With re-
gard to increasing the number of verb translations,
Exp. 2 shows an almost universal benefit for Ger-
man, but still mixed results for Spanish, which may
indicate that verb translations for Spanish are still
?looser? than the German ones.
In fact, most remaining poor judgments are the
result of problematic translations, which stem from
three main sources. The first one is sparse data. Infre-
quent German and Spanish words often receive unre-
liable vector representations. Some examples are the
6Note, however, that AnCora has an imperfect coverage for
DOBJs (60%). This is because our Spanish dataset contains
verbs sampled from Encarta that do not occur in AnCora.

German Tau (?dew?, frequency of 180 in the HGC),
translated as alley, and Reifepr?fung (German SAT,
frequency 120), translated as affiliation. Both of these
may also be due to the difference in genre between
the HGC and the BNC. A second problem is formed
by nearest neighbors that are ontologically dissimi-
lar, as in the tenista ?tennis player?/tennis example
from above. A final issue relates to limitations of the
Pad? et al (2007) model, whose architecture is sus-
ceptible to polysemy-related problems. For instance,
the Spanish combination (excavar, obj, terreno) was
judged by speakers as very plausible, but its English
equivalent (excavate, obj, land) is assigned a very
low score by the model. This might be due to the
fact that in the BNC, land occurs often in its political
meaning, and forms an outlier among the head words
for (excavate,obj).
How much syntactic information is necessary?
The syntax-aware model requires syntactic infor-
mation about the source language, which seems to
run counter to our original motivation of developing
methods for resource-poor languages. To address this
point, we analyzed the behavior of the syntax-aware
model for small syntactically analyzed corpora that
contained only at most m occurrences for each pred-
icate. We obtained the m occurrences by sampling
from the syntactically analyzed part of the HGC; if
fewer than m occurrences were present in the corpus,
we simply used these. Figure 3 shows the training
curve with 1 verb translation, averaged over n rounds
(n = 10 for 5 arguments, n = 5 for 10 arguments,
n = 4 for 20, 50 and 100 arguments). The general
picture is clear: most of the benefit of the syntactic
data is drawn form the first five occurrences for each
argument position. This shows that a small amount of
targeted syntactic annotation can improve the cross-
lingual model substantially.
7 Conclusions
In this article, we have presented a first unsuper-
vised cross-lingual model of selectional preferences.
Our model proceeds by automatically translating
(predicate, argument position, head word) triples for
resource-poor source languages into a resource-rich
target language, where accurate selectional prefer-
ence models are available. The translation is based on
a bilingual vector space, which can be bootstrapped

from large unparsed corpora in the two languages.
Our results indicate that bilingual methods can go
a long way towards the modeling of selectional pref-
erences in resource-poor languages, where bilingual
lexicons, parallel corpora, or ontologies might not be
available. Our experiments have looked at German
and Spanish, where the cross-lingual models rival
and even exceed monolingual methods that typically
have to rely on small, clean ?treebank?-style corpora
or large, very noisy, automatically parsed corpora.
We have also demonstrated that noisy syntactic data
from the source language can be integrated in our
model, where it helps improve the cross-lingual han-
dling of argument positions. The linguistic distance
between the languages can impact (1) the ability to
find accurate translations and (2) the degree of syntac-
tic overlap; nevertheless, as Agirre et al (2003) show,
the transfer is possible even for unrelated languages.
In this paper, we have instantiated the selectional
preference model in the target language (English)
with the distributional model by Pad? et al (2007).
However, our approach is modular and can be com-
bined with any other selectional preference model.
We see two main avenues for future work: (1), The
construction of properly bilingual models where
source language information can also help to fur-
ther improve the target language model (Diab and
Resnik, 2002); (2), The extension of our cross-lingual
mapping for the argument position to mappings that
hold across multiple predicates as well as argument-
dependent mappings like the Spanish direct objects,
whose realization depends on their animacy.
