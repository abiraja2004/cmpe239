L )~ntroduction 
The Dh'ect Memoiy Access (DMA) paradignr has been re.- 
searched as a new model fox' natural anguage processing 
(Riesl~eck&M~fin\[1985\] and Riesbeck\[1986\], Tomabechi- 
\[1987a\]). h this paradigm, natural anguage understanding 
is viewed a; an effort to recognize input sentences by using 
p~c-cxisting knowledge in memory, which is often experien.- 
tial aud cpi:;odic. It is contrasted with traditional models of 
parsing in which syntactic and semantic representations itre 
built as the result of parsing and are normally lost after each 
parse. In the DMA model, input sentences are identified with 
the memory sU'ucture which represents he input, and are in- 
stantiatcd to represent flint specific input. Since understanding 
is performed as recognition through the memoly network, the 
result of understanding is ~aot lost after each sentence is pro- 
cessed. Also, since parsing and memory-based inferences are 
integrated, ~arious memory~based activities emt be triggered 
directly through natural language understanding without sep- 
arate inferential processes. 
As on~' application of DMA, at the Center for Machine 
"l?anslatioil (CMT) at Carnegie Mellon University, we have 
developed a natucal anguage interface for our large-scale 
knowledge-based machine translation system t called DM- 
(~OMMAND. This application of DMA demonstrates the power 
of this m(~lcl, since direct access to memory during parsing al- 
lows dyna,~dc evaluation of input commands and question an~ 
~we~ing without running separate inferential processes, while 
dynanfic~d~y utilizing the MT system's already existing do- 
,~lahl 13~owlcdge sonrces~ The implementation f the DMA 
aTtte CM!3-MT systcin which is the target system fo~ tic DMo 
COiV~r?~AND sy:~tem described in this paper is described in detail in Tomita- 
&Cmbtmell\[1987\] and Mitamufa, et a/t1988\]. 
natural anguage system has been completed and is used for 
development of actual grammars, domain knowledge-bases, 
and syntax/semantic mapping rules by the researchers atCMT. 
This system has been demonstrated to be highly effective as 
a MT developmental support system, since researchers who 
develop these individual knowledge sources are otherwise un- 
knowledgeable about the internal implementation f the MT 
system. The DMA natural anguage interface can provide 
access (currently English and Japanese) to the system's inter- 
nal functions through natural anguage command and query 
inputs. This use of the DMA model for natural language iw 
terfaces demonstrates that it is an effective alternative toother 
natural language interface schemes. 
II. A background of DMA 
The Direct Memoly Access method of parsing originated in 
Quillian~s\[1968\] notion of semantic memory, which was nsed 
in his TLC (Quillian\[1969\]) which led to further esearch in 
semantic network-based processing 2. TLC used breadth-first 
spreading marker-passing as an intersection search of two lex- 
ically pointed nodes in a semantic memory, leaving interpreta- 
tion of text as an intersection of the paths. Thus, interpretation 
of input text was directly performed on semantic memory. Al- 
though TLC was the first DMA system, DMA had not been 
explored as a model of parsing until the DMAP0 system of 
Riesbeek&Martin, except as a scheme for disambiguations. 
I)MAP0 used a guided marker-passing algorithm to avoid the 
problem of an explosion of search paths, from which a dumb 3
(not guided) marker passing mechanism inherently suffers. 
DMAP0 used P~markers (Prediction markers) and A-markers 
(Activation markers) as markers passed around in memory, 
adopting the notion of concept sequence to represent linear 
ordering of concepts as linguistic knowledge, which guides 
linear predictions of concepts ending P-markers in memory.

\[1987\], and Bookman\[1987\]. 
aWe call it 'dumb' when markers are passed everywhere (through all 
lix~ks) from a node. In a 'guided' scheme, markers are passed through 
specific links only.

mantic network of domain knowledge used by the MT sys.. 
tern, the DM-COMMAND has separate memory network repo 
resenting concepts involved in performing various actions in 
the MT system. Among such concepts is the concept 'show- 
frame', which represents the aetiou of pretty-printing bSRAME- 
KIT definitions stored as domain knowledge. This concept 
has the concept sequence <mtrans-word person *CONCEPI"> 
attached to it. This concept sequence prcdicts that the first 
input word may point to au instance of 'mtraus-word ~ (such 
as 'show~), followed by an instance of person fi)llowed by

that the concept which represents he request for action is di- 
rectly connected to the concept that represents he action that 
is requested. Likewise, the direct memory access recognition 
of a question means that the concept which is identified by the 
input is directly connected to the concept hat represents he 
answer, as long as the system knows (or potentially knows) 
the answer. In oilier words, in the DMA model, recognition of
a request for action is a triggering of the action requested and 
recognition of a question is knowing the answer (i.e., as soon 
as we understand the question, either we know the answer, or 
we know the inferences to be performed (or functions to be 
evaluated) to get the answer) as long as memory contains the 
action and the answer. 'lb reiterate the literature on the DMA 
paradigm, in this model, memory is organized in the hierarchi- 
cal network of concepts which are related by links that define 
the concepts. Thus, as soon as we identify the input with a 
certain concept in the memory, we can trigger the action (if 
this is a concept that represents some action (or request for ac- 
tion)), or answer the question (if the concept represents some 
knowledge (or request for some knowledge)). Thus, parsing 
and inference are integrated in the memory search process, 
and no separate inferential modules are necessary. It should 
be understood; however, that it is not our claim that we can 
eliminate inference altogether. Our claim is that 1) the mem- 
ory search through concept refinement itself is an inference 
which is normally performed by separate inference modules- 
(such as eontexual inference and discourse analyses modules) 
in other parsing paradigm; and 2) whenever further inference 
is necessary, such inference can be directly triggered after 
concept refinement from the result of parse (for example, as a 
daemon stored in the abstraction of the refined concept) and 
therefore, the inference is integrated in the memory activity. 
C. Ellispsis and anaphora  
In a practical natural language interface, the capacity to han- 
dle elliptic and anaphorie xpressions i important. DM- 
COMMAND is capable of handling these phenomena, be- 
cause under the DMA paradigm (which is typically called 
"recognize-and-record paradigm"), the result of each parse is 
not lost after each sentence, but instead remains as part of the 
contexual knowledge in the memory network. On the other 
hand, in the traditional parsing paradigm (we call it "build- 
and~store" paradigm), since the result of the parse is lost af- 
ter each sentence, the parsers can at best handle indexicality 
within a sentence. Specifically, 1) ellipses are handled by 
DM-CoMMAND; since ellipses are characterized asthe lack of 
elements in a concept sequence, and these are recoverable as 
long as the elements or their descendants had been activated 
in previous parsesl4; 2) anaphoric and pronoun references are 
~4For example, with the input "jgt92.gra o uchidase, sem.tst mo." (Print 
jgr92.gra. Sem.tst also). Second senteuce has the object droped; however, 
resolved by utilization of both semantic knowledge (repre-. 
sented as restrictions on possible types of resolutions) and 
also by the context left from the previous parses in memory 
similar to the way,that he elliptic expressions am handled. 
Finding a contexually salient NP corresponding to sotr~e NP 
means, in DMA, searching for a concept in memory which 
is previously activated and can be contexually substit~te fox' 
currently active concept sequencetS o 
Do DMA and syntax 
One weakness of current implementations of th~ If)MA 
paradigm is that the concept sequence is the sole syntactic 
knowledge for parsing 16. Therefore, a DMA system needs 
deliberate preparation of concept sequences tohandle syntac- 
tically complex sentences ( uch as deeply embedded clauses~ 
small cauls ,  many types of sentential djuncts, etc.). This 
does not mean that it is incapable of handling syntactically 
complex sentences, instead it means that concept sequences 
at some level of abstraction (at syntactic template l vel down 
to phrasal lexicon (Becker\[1975\]) level) must be prepared for 
each type of complex sentence. In other words, although 
such sentences can be handled by the combination of con- 
cept sequences, designing such sequences can be complex and 
less general than using external syntactic knowledge 17. Thus, 
current reliance upon a linear sequence of concepts causes 
limitations on the types of sentences that can be realistically 
handled in DM-COMMAND. Of course, there is nothing to pre- 
vent DMA paradigm to integrate syntactic knowledge othea' 
than a linear sequence of concepts. Actually, we have already 
implemented two alternative schemes for integrating phrase- 
structure rules into DMA. One method we used was having 
syntactic nodes as part of the memory and writing phrase- 
structure rules as concept sequences 18. Another method was 
to integrate the DMA memory activity into an augnrnented 
context-free grammar unification i  a generalized LR parsing. 
Second method used in a continuous speech understanding 
is described in Tomabeetti&Tomita\[ms\]. We will not discuss 
these schemes in this paper. 
While handling syntactically complex sentences i  rather 
expensive for DM-COMMAND, since it relies solely on linear 
concept sequences, natural language interfaces are one appli- 
tiffs can be supplied since the memory activity after the first sentence is ~ot 
lost and the memory can supply the missing object. 
15Fur example in"Pretty-print dm.lisp. Send it to mt@.nr'~ "it" can be 
identified with the concept inmemory that represents din.lisp which was 
activated inmemory during the understanding of the first sentence. 
t~Although eneration is normally helped by external syntactic katowl- 
edge snch as in file case of DM'I'RANS. 
17Also, pronoun and anaphora resolution is based upon contexual knowl- 
edge alone; however, use of syntactic knowledge (such as rite governing 
category of an anaphora) would help such efforts.

cation area where the capacity to handle phenomena such as 
ellipsis, auaphora, pronoun resolution, and contexual disam- 
bignation is more valuable than handling syntactically com- 
plex sentences. It seems that DMA is one ideal paradigm in 
this axeao This is evident if we consider the fact that input 
to a natui'al language interface is normally in a form of di- 
alog and users tend to input short, elliptic, ambiguous aud 
even ungrammatical sentences to the interface. Our experi- 
ence shows that an increase in the size and complexity of 
the system ~n order to integrate full syntaciic processing, en- 
hancing the DMA's capacity to handle syntactically complex 
sentences, has so far outweighed the need for such capacity 19.

\])M-COMt,.~AND utilizes two types of semantic networks. One 
is the semantic network that is developed under the MT system 
as domain knowledge that DM-COMMAND utilizes. The other 
as the network of memoxy which is unique to DM-COMMAND. 
This memory represents a hierarchy of concepts involved in 
commanding and question-answering necessary for the devel- 
opment of machine translation systems. This memory network 
is written with generic concepts for development of MT sys- 
tems, so that this memory we have developed at CMT should 
be portable to other systems 2?. 
The control mechanism (i.e., spreading activation guided 
marker-passing algorithm) and the actual functions for per- 
forming actions are separate (actu',d functions ale integrated 
iuto the \]D~/~-COMMAND memory network). This separation 
makes the system highly portable, first because virtually no 
change is necessary in the control mecharfism for iranspolting 
to other systems, and second because the size of the whole 
system can be trimmed or expanded according to the ma- 
chine's aw61able virtual memory space simply by changing 
the size of the DM-COMMAND memory network 21. 
Thus, ~mder DMA, a natural anguage interface can 1) 
directly spr,~ad markers on the target system's already ex- 
isting semautic network 22, utilizing the existing knowledge 
19Although, we have seen that it is effective in parsing noisy continuous 
sl)eech input (Tomabechi&Tomita\[ms\]). 
~Of conrse~ we will need to change the specific functions that are stored 
in some of the nodes and perhaps some of the specific (lower in the hier- 
archy) concepls need to be modified for each specific system. 
21if only a l)asic command natural language interface is required, then 
we can trim |h,~ pints of memory used for adwmced interface and question- 
answering. (h~ the other hand, if machine's memory is of no concern, we 
can write memory-net and concept-sequences fbr all the system functions of

mal'ker..passing algorifllm of the DM-CoMMAND recognizer, the speed of 
the system isndnimally affected by an increase inthe size of the memory for 
commanding and qnestion-mlswering. It is because spreading activation is 
local to each concept and its packaged nodes under guided marker-passing 
that even if the size of the whole memory network increased, the amount 
of computation for each concept should not inerea~ accordingly.

query conceptual network developed elsewhere (such as DM- 
COMMAND), with minimum ~todifications in the functions 
stored in the root nodes that ~h-igger the actions; 3) be ported 
to different systems with virtually no change in the control 
mechanism since it is a guided spreading activation marker- 
passing mechanism and no system specific functions are in- 
eluded (those functions are included in the comand/query se- 
mantic net). 
V. Conclusion 
DM-.COMMAND is the first practical application of the DMA 
paradigm of natural anguage understanding, in which pars- 
ing and memory-based inference is integrated. This system 
has been proven to be highly effective in knowledge-based 
MT development. It is due to the complexity of system im- 
plementations in a large scale MT project that grammar and 
knowledge base writers axe not expected to have expertise ou 
the internals of the translation system, whereas it is necessary 
for such a group of project members to access the system in- 
ternal functions. DM-COMMAND makes this access possible 
through a natural language command and question answering 
interface. Since DM-COMMAND uses the spreading activa- 
tion guided marker-passing algorithm, in a memory access 
parser which directly accesses the MT system's already exist~ 
ing network of concepts, inference is integrated into memory 
activity. Since there is a separate memory network for con- 
cepts representing commanding and question-answering that 
are generic to MT system development, the system is highly 
portable. The DM-COMMAND system demonstrates the power 
of a direct memory access paradigm as a model for a natu- 
ral language interface, since understanding in this model is a 
l'ecognition of the input sentence with the existing knowledge 
in memory, and as soon as such understanding is done, the 
desired command can be directly triggered (or the question 
directly answered). 
With DMA's ability to handle xtra-sentential phenomena 
(including ellipsis, anaphora, pronoun reference, and word- 
sense ambiguity), which are typical in a practical natural lan- 
guage commaud/query inputs, DMA is one ideal paradigm for 
natural anguage interfaces as shown in our DM-COMMAND 
system. Also, DMA's integration of parsing and inference into 
an unified semantic memory search has proven to be highly 
effective in this application.
