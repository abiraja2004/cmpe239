When Prof. Wolfgang Wahlster (the organizer 
of this COLING-86 panel on "Natural Language 
Interfaces: Ready for Commercial Success?") 
sent out invitations to panelists, he stated 
that his goals were "to evaluate three 
natural language interfaces which were 
introduced to the commercial market in 1985 
and to relate them to current research in 
computational linguistics." For comparison, 
he has asked each of us panelists to answer a 
standard set of questions. These I will 
answer, but first let me set the stage by 
answering two logically prior queries. 
00) What is your  commercia l  system? 
Our system, called Q&A, was introduced by 
Symantec in September of 1985. Q&A is an 
integrated package for the IBM PC/XT/AT and 
compatibles. Its major modules are a file 
management system, a report generator, a word 
processor (which was used to compose this 
document), a spelling checker and "the 
intelligent assistant" or "IA." The IA lets 
users manipulate databases and produce 
reports by issuing commands in English. 
Note that Q&A is NOT sold as a natural 
language interface per se, but as an 
integrated business-productivity tool. 
0) Why did you give your natural  language 
subsystem such a pompous name? 
Our marketing department made me do it. 
The Wahls ter  Quest ions 
i) How successfu l  is your commercial  system? 
How many copies have been sold? Q&A's monthly 
sales are measured in thousands. SoftSel, 
the major US distributor of software for 
microcomputers, publishes a "hot list" every 
two weeks ranking its best selling products. 
Q&A has been in the top i0 since February of 
this year, and has been as high as number 2. 
At the time of this writing, it is number 3, 
below only dBASE III and Lotus 123. 
Are they being used on a regular basis? 
Hundreds of people use Q&A every day, and 
thousands use it frequently. Although we 
have not conducted a rigorous survey, straw 
polls indicate that about half the active Q&A 
users use the IA on a regular basis. (Many 
people use the product mostly for WP.) 
Are there cost-benefit analyses? No, but 
with a $299 suggested retail price in the 
U.S. market it doesn't take much analysis to 
justify the cost. Since Q&A integrates 
modules for filing, reporting, writing, and 
spelling along with the IA, the pro rata 
price of the IA is only $60, which can often 
be recovered by answering a single question! 
Has the system been empirically evaluated? 
Q&A has been reviewed by every major (and 
most minor) publications addressing the IBM 
PC market, and has received consistently high 
reviews. Infowor ld gave Q&A a 5 disk rating 
--its highest. Pc Week has called Q&A the 
"quintessential management tool." Q&A was 
the first software product ever featured in 
Der Spiegel; it took honors as the software 
"product of the year" in Australia; and it 
received an unprecedented 2-part review in 
the New York Times. 
Q&A was also evaluated by the National 
Software Testing Laboratories, widely 
considered to provide the microcomputer 
industry's most objective testing, in a 
comprehensive survey of file management 
systems for IBM PCs. Results were published 
by Software Digest in February, 1986, in a 
68-page report covering both evaluations and 
methodologies. Q&A received the highest 
overall evaluation ever given to any product 
in any category, and was tops in the critical 
areas of ease-of-use and ease-of-learning. 
In fact, Q&A was tops in all categories 
except speed, where it placed second against 
a system that keeps all its data in RAM 
rather than on disk. 
How well do users adapt to system 
limitations? Users have been remarkably 
forgiving of natural language limitations, as 
measured by calls on our telephone support 
hot line. The chief complaint about the IA 
is not its language limitations, but its 
speed on floppy-based systems. (On an EBM AT 
with hard disk, performance is not an issue.) 
What are the main areas of a_p_plication? 
Among the most popular in a straw poll were: 
customer lists, personal records, simple 
inventories, expense reporting, bibliographic 
data, tax records, project records, job 
costing, employee records, enrollments, real 
estate, church records, prospect tracking. 
2) What are the most  important  factors for 
success of a NL interface? 
The key is to realize that users do not care 
about NL interfaces--they only want to get a 
job done. Thus the important thing is to 
help the user accomplish his task. 
To help users do their jobs, Q&A provides 
both a NL interface and formal interfaces. 
Some customers like the formal interfaces so 
well they never bother with the IA. (This 
troubles me, but I take consolation in the 
facts that these users are in the minority, 
they appear to be happy, and we charge the 
same whether they use the IA or not.) 
As for getting the job done through NL, good 
164 
l inguist ic  coverage and robustness in pars ing 
are c lear ly important. Yet I was amazed to 
d iscover that users are often content to find 
ANY Engl ish phras ing that wil l  retr ieve the 
data they need, and don't seem too worr ied if 
their  most natural way of phrasing a request 
doesn't  work. 
For a gener ic  database product, being able to 
port to new sets of data is a necessity. 
Q&A's IA is adapted to new data bases 
pr imar i ly  through automatic means: The IA 
uses information from the database itself  to 
extend its vocabulary. Users can also 
provide addit ional  vocabulary manual ly  
through the TEACH module. This module is 
composed of eight subsystems for giv ing the 
IA "lessons" about words that wil l  be used 
with the new database. 
Far more human-factors  effort went into the 
development and test ing of TEACH than into 
any other part of Q&A. But the results are 
mixed. While, we bel ieve we have produced by 
far the most easi ly ported NL system on the 
market, at least 10% of our customers 
contacted in a straw poll indicated that they 
were int imidated by the TEACH lessons, and 
therefore are shunning the IA in favor of the 
formal systems for manipulat ing the data. 
There are no provis ions in Q&A for modi fy ing 
the under ly ing grammar rules. This is 
because Q&A has been designed as a product 
for end-users, not as a system-bui ld ing tool 
for programmers or l inguists. If some users 
are int imidated by even the simple vocabulary 
acquis i t ion lessons of the Q&A TEACH module, 
it seems obvious that al lowing users to 
modify the grammar would court disaster. 
3) Isn,t it too early for commercia l  NL 
systems? 
Q&A sales reports seem to indicate otherwise. 
4) Will  customers lose interest in NL if 
overblown expectat ions cannot be ful f i l led 
now? 
In advance of Q&A's introduction, Symantec's 
whole management team was worr ied about 
inf lated expectations, and a concerted effort 
was mounted to meet this challenge. Of 
course, we did all we could to make the NL 
capabi l i ty  robust. But we also undertook the 
task of educat ing the microcomputer  industry 
infrastructure BEFORE introduction. This was 
done through countless interviews with 
industry analysts, f inancial people, authors, 
distr ibutors,  retailers, lecturers, the 
press, consultants, and executives from 
var ious hardware and software firms. Through 
their  influence, these people help set the 
expectat ions of the market. 
To my surpr ise and relief, most of these 
industry insiders seemed to expect less from 
NL than Q&A delivers. We are benef i t ing from 
the backlash to AI being oversold previously. 
As for the customers themselves, they divide 
into two groups, with di f ferent expectations. 
Those who have not used computers before 
don't  know what to expect. If anything, they 
th ink these "electronic brains" already use 
NL. So even if they are sometimes 
d isappointed by the l imitat ions of today's NL 
systems, the d isappointment is less than it 
would be using convent ional  interfaces? 
Those who already use computers either don't  
care about NL (because they take pride in 
having learned formal systems) or they are 
encouraged by how much CAN be done with NL. 
We have been pleased to find that many power 
users of micros choose the IA rather than 
Q&A's query-by-example system? These users 
appreciate the power of natural  language. 
There is, of course, great room for 
improvement in commercial  NL systems. Early 
attempts l ike Q&A are useful  in educat ing the 
market  about NL's potential  and in sett ing 
reasonable expectat ions for future products? 
5) Is it just a tremendous amount of 
engineer ing to transform a research system 
into a commercial  product  or is it much more 
(e.g. new concepts, algorithms)? 
The answer to this quest ion depends upon what 
the "product" is. To turn a research system 
into a language development tool for 
programmers involves most ly  stra ightforward 
engineering. (Yet such a tool could be 
important in the r ight niche markets.) 
Creat ing a v iable end-user  product for the 
mass market  is another story. In this arena, 
product market ing (i.e., designing a product  
from the user 's  point of v iew to fill a real 
need) and craftsmanship are even more 
important than the enabl ing technology. 
To produce Q&A, Symantec devoted only l imited 
resources to the development of the NL 
analysis system per se. Far more time was 
devoted to human-factors  and performance 
issues, which are not general ly  important in 
NL research systems. Considerable 
intel lectual  attent ion was focused on TEACH, 
on extract ing NL related information from the 
database, on parse-t ime error handling, and 
on developing robust pars ing methodologies.  
And all of these act iv i t ies were dwarfed by 
the efforts to develop the database, report 
generator  and word processor with their 
concomitant  support software? 
6) How wil l  the market for NL interfaces 
evolve? (Gee, I wish I real ly knew!) 
The fact that Q&A is so high on the sales 
charts is not l ikely to escape the attent ion 
of other developers of software for micro-  
computers. Because part of the program's 
success is c lear ly attr ibutable to the IA, it 
is reasonable to expect other microcomputer  
p layers to begin incorporat ing NL in their  
products also. 
Lotus Development Corp. recently bought GNP, 
the developer  of a natural  language interface 
for 123. Thus, the most v is ib le player in 
the microcomputer  software industry has 
announced its interest in the NL area. If 
165 
this product reaches the market bearing the 
Lotus brand name, natural language interfaces 
will have received a major endorsement. 
Another factor is that personal computers may 
soon reach significantly lower price points. 
When high-resolution micros with a megabyte 
of memory and fast processors (80386 or 68000 
family) reach the $i000 level, another market 
tier will open, attracting a new and larger 
group of people to computers. This group is 
distinct from the number-hungry group that 
made spread sheets popular. It will be more 
symbol-oriented, wanting word processing and 
access to on-line (or CD-ROM) data. NL 
interfaces can play a pivotal role in 
reaching this potential market. 
I think NLP will be widely used to help do 
sophisticated spelling and grammar checking 
in support of word processors. In the short 
term, this application of NLP may be more 
important commercially than NL interfaces. 
Speech input, as usual, is "just around the 
corner." 
7) Should commercia l  systems be des igned for 
mainframes,  AI workstat ions  or micros? 
Obviously, microcomputers are too small for 
NL systems. So I advise all of you to 
concentrate on mainframes. Better, build 
your own special hardware to support NLP. 
8) Is it a market  advantage to be 
multil ingual? 
THE advantage of NL systems is understanding 
one's mother tongue. What good is an English 
NL system to me if I only speak German? I 
would be better off with a formal system! 
Each major natural language defines a 
separate market. To reach all these markets 
requires a system for each tongue. 
Symantec clearly recognizes the importance of 
translating Q&A into multiple languages. 
F&A, the German language version of Q&A, is 
already in an advanced state of development, 
and work has begun on other languages. 
9) What research seems most important for 
improving the qual i ty  of commercia l  products? 
In "Natural Language Processing: The Field in 
Perspective" (Byte, 9/81), Earl Sacerdoti and 
I sketched three types of NL systems. Q&A 
belongs to the most primitive of these three 
types. I do not believe that the technology, 
the hardware or the market is ready for the 
more advanced types of NL systems, but it i~ 
upon these types that our basic-research 
energies should be concentrated. 
As for applied research, it would be useful 
to focus on database transportability. TEACH 
is c lear ly  the weak link in Q&A. 
Also, now that thousands of people have NL 
systems, our community desperately needs to 
discover how they are really being used. 
symantec has a great deal of anecdotal 
166 
evidence about the use of Q&A, but lacks the 
resources to do anything approaching a 
thorough study. (And besides, the study 
needs to be done by psychologists, not our 
crew of computer and language hackers.) 
i0) How do you assess the role of... 
NL~enerat ion:  After Q&A has interpreted a 
user's input, its proposed response is 
presented in English so that the user may be 
advised about what Q&A plans to do. We 
believe this feedback is essential, and that 
this and other applications give NL 
generation a bright future. 
Cooperative response qeneration: This is an 
obvious next step--simple, cheap and useful. 
Speech act recognition: Some steps in this 
direction have already been taken in Q&A (as 
in "I wish I knew the time"), but I believe 
we are a long way from having any viable 
commercial system that incorporate a 
meaningful theory of speech acts. 
User modelinq: Anything other than the most 
superficial modeling probably requires too 
much memory for today's micros. 
~resentat ion  lanquaqes & new t/fp_@s 
of qrammars: Those that are not just fads 
could have an impact in a few years, but I 
don't see them impacting the next generation 
of commercial products, at least not on 
microcomputers. Personally, I weary from 
seeing the same old ~tuff redone each year in 
a new programming language. I suppose some 
progress is made in this process, but it 
seems painfully slow. It would be better to 
focus more of our community's resources on 
natural language problems, rather than on 
polishing programming language techniques. 
Multimedia communications: A big opportunity 
exists today for mixing pointing with NL 
input. There are obvious applications when 
dealing with land maps or other 
representations of space. 
one More Question: What  does it all mean? 
The early indications are that the market is 
enthusiastically accepting Q&A and its NL 
component. Within a year we should know 
whether NL ability of the kind incorporated 
in Q&A is simply a passing fad or is 
perceived by the market as providing real 
value. If the latter is the case (and I 
believe it is), then the market will begin to 
demand NL capabilities in more and more 
products. Either way, there will be much 
exciting work to do. 
Acknowledgment:  Major contributions to the 
design/implementation of the IA were made by 
Dan Gordon, Brett Walter and Denis Coleman.
