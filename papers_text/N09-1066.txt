Abstract
The number of research publications in var-
ious disciplines is growing exponentially.
Researchers and scientists are increasingly
finding themselves in the position of having
to quickly understand large amounts of tech-
nical material. In this paper we present the
first steps in producing an automatically gen-
erated, readily consumable, technical survey.
Specifically we explore the combination of
citation information and summarization tech-
niques. Even though prior work (Teufel et
al., 2006) argues that citation text is unsuitable
for summarization, we show that in the frame-
work of multi-document survey creation, cita-
tion texts can play a crucial role.
1 Introduction
In today?s rapidly expanding disciplines, scientists
and scholars are constantly faced with the daunting
task of keeping up with knowledge in their field. In
addition, the increasingly interconnected nature of
real-world tasks often requires experts in one dis-
cipline to rapidly learn about other areas in a short
amount of time.
Cross-disciplinary research requires scientists in
areas such as linguistics, biology, and sociology
to learn about computational approaches and appli-
cations, e.g., computational linguistics, biological
modeling, social networks. Authors of journal ar-
ticles and books must write accurate surveys of pre-
vious work, ranging from short summaries of related
research to in-depth historical notes.
Interdisciplinary review panels are often called
upon to review proposals in a wide range of areas,
some of which may be unfamiliar to panelists. Thus,
they must learn about a new discipline ?on the fly?
in order to relate their own expertise to the proposal.
Our goal is to effectively serve these needs by
combining two currently available technologies: (1)
bibliometric lexical link mining that exploits the
structure of citations and relations among citations;
and (2) summarization techniques that exploit the
content of the material in both the citing and cited
papers.
It is generally agreed upon that manually written
abstracts are good summaries of individual papers.
More recently, Qazvinian and Radev (2008) argue
that citation texts are useful in creating a summary
of the important contributions of a research paper.
The citation text of a target paper is the set of sen-
tences in other technical papers that explicitly refer
to it (Elkiss et al, 2008a). However, Teufel (2005)
argues that using citation text directly is not suitable
for document summarization.
In this paper, we compare and contrast the use-
fulness of abstracts and of citation text in automati-
cally generating a technical survey on a given topic
from multiple research papers. The next section pro-
vides the background for this work, including the
primary features of a technical survey and also the
types of input that are used in our study (full pa-
pers, abstracts, and citation texts). Following this,
we describe related work and point out the advances
of our work over previous work. We then describe
how citation texts are used as a new input for multi-
document summarization to produce surveys of a
given technical area. We apply four different sum-
marization techniques to data in the ACL Anthol-
584
ogy and evaluate our results using both automatic
(ROUGE) and human-mediated (nugget-based pyra-
mid) measures. We observe that, as expected, ab-
stracts are useful in survey creation, but, notably, we
also conclude that citation texts have crucial survey-
worthy information not present in (or at least, not
easily extractable from) abstracts. We further dis-
cover that abstracts are author-biased and thus com-
plementary to the broader perspective inherent in ci-
tation texts; these differences enable the use of a
range of different levels and types of information in
the survey?the extent of which is subject to survey
length restrictions (if any).
2 Background
Automatically creating technical surveys is sig-
nificantly distinct from that of traditional multi-
document summarization. Below we describe pri-
mary characteristics of a technical survey and we
present three types of input texts that we used for
the production of surveys.
2.1 Technical Survey
In the case of multi-document summarization, the
goal is to produce a readable presentation of mul-
tiple documents, whereas in the case of technical
survey creation, the goal is to convey the key fea-
tures of a particular field, basic underpinnings of the
field, early and late developments, important con-
tributions and findings, contradicting positions that
may reverse trends or start new sub-fields, and ba-
sic definitions and examples that enable rapid un-
derstanding of a field by non-experts.
A prototypical example of a technical survey is
that of ?chapter notes,? i.e., short (50?500 word)
descriptions of sub-areas found at the end of chap-
ters of textbook, such as Jurafsky and Martin (2008).
One might imagine producing such descriptions au-
tomatically, then hand-editing them and refining
them for use in an actual textbook.
We conducted a human analysis of these chapter
notes that revealed a set of conventions, an outline
of which is provided here (with example sentences
in italics):
1. Introductory/opening statement: The earliest
computational use of X was in Y, considered by
many to be the foundational work in this area.
2. Definitional follow up: X is def ined as Y.
3. Elaboration of definition (e.g., with an exam-
ple): Most early algorithms were based on Z.
4. Deeper elaboration, e.g., pointing out issues
with initial approaches: Unfortunately, this
model seems to be wrong.
5. Contrasting definition: Algorithms since then...
6. Introduction of additional specific instances /
historical background with citations: Two clas-
sic approaches are described in Q.
7. References to other summaries: R provides a
comprehensive guide to the details behind X.
The notion of text level categories or zoning
of technical papers?related to the survey compo-
nents enumerated above?has been investigated pre-
viously in the work of Nanba and Kan (2004b) and
Teufel (2002). These earlier works focused on the
analysis of scientific papers based on their rhetori-
cal structure and on determining the portions of pa-
pers that contain new results, comparisons to ear-
lier work, etc. The work described in this paper fo-
cuses on the synthesis of technical surveys based on
knowledge gleaned from rhetorical structure not un-
like that of the work of these earlier researchers, but
perhaps guided by structural patterns along the lines
of the conventions listed above.
Although our current approach to survey creation
does not yet incorporate a fully pattern-based com-
ponent, our ultimate objective is to apply these pat-
terns to guide the creation and refinement of the final
output. As a first step toward this goal, we use cita-
tion texts (closest in structure to the patterns iden-
tified by convention 7 above) to pick out the most
important content for survey creation.
2.2 Full papers, abstracts, and citation texts
Published research on a particular topic can be sum-
marized from two different kinds of sources: (1)
where an author describes her own work and (2)
where others describe an author?s work (usually in
relation to their own work). The author?s descrip-
tion of her own work can be found in her paper. How
others perceive her work is spread across other pa-
pers that cite her work. We will refer to the set of
sentences that explicitly mention a target paper Y as
the citation text of Y.
585
Traditionally, technical survey generation has
been tackled by summarizing a set of research pa-
pers pertaining to the topic. However, individual re-
search papers usually come with manually-created
?summaries??their abstracts. The abstract of a pa-
per may have sentences that set the context, state the
problem statement, mention how the problem is ap-
proached, and the bottom-line results?all in 200 to
500 words. Thus, using only the abstracts (instead
of full papers) as input to a summarization system is
worth exploring.
Whereas the abstract of a paper presents what the
authors think to be the important contributions of a
paper, the citation text of a paper captures what oth-
ers in the field perceive as the contributions of the
paper. The two perspectives are expected to have
some overlap in their content, but the citation text
also contains additional information not found in ab-
stracts (Elkiss et al, 2008a). For example, how a
particular methodology (described in one paper) was
combined with another (described in a different pa-
per) to overcome some of the drawbacks of each.
A citation text is also an indicator of what contri-
butions described in a paper were more influential
over time. Another distinguishing feature of citation
texts in contrast to abstracts is that a citation text
tends to have a certain amount of redundant informa-
tion. This is because multiple papers may describe
the same contributions of a target paper. This redun-
dancy can be exploited to determine the important
contributions of the target paper.
Our goal is to test the hypothesis that an ef-
fective technical survey will reflect information on
research not only from the perspective of its au-
thors but also from the perspective of others who
use/commend/discredit/add to it. Before describ-
ing our experiments with technical papers, abstracts,
and citation texts, we first summarize relevant prior
work that used these sources of information as input.
3 Related work
Previous work has focused on the analysis of cita-
tion and collaboration networks (Teufel et al, 2006;
Newman, 2001) and scientific article summarization
(Teufel and Moens, 2002). Bradshaw (2003) used
citation texts to determine the content of articles and
improve the results of a search engine. Citation
texts have also been used to create summaries of sin-
gle scientific articles in Qazvinian and Radev (2008)
and Mei and Zhai (2008). However, there is no pre-
vious work that uses the text of the citations to pro-
duce a multi-document survey of scientific articles.
Furthermore, there is no study contrasting the qual-
ity of surveys generated from citation summaries?
both automatically and manually produced?to sur-
veys generated from other forms of input such as the
abstracts or full texts of the source articles.
Nanba and Okumura (1999) discuss citation cate-
gorization to support a system for writing a survey.
Nanba et al (2004a) automatically categorize cita-
tion sentences into three groups using pre-defined
phrase-based rules. Based on this categorization a
survey generation tool is introduced in Nanba et al
(2004b). They report that co-citation (where both
papers are cited by many other papers) implies sim-
ilarity by showing that the textual similarity of co-
cited papers is proportional to the proximity of their
citations in the citing article.
Elkiss et al (2008b) conducted several exper-
iments on a set of 2,497 articles from the free
PubMed Central (PMC) repository.1 Results from
this experiment confirmed that the cohesion of a ci-
tation text of an article is consistently higher than
the that of its abstract. They also concluded that ci-
tation texts contain additional information are more
focused than abstracts.
Nakov et al (2004) use sentences surrounding ci-
tations to create training and testing data for seman-
tic analysis, synonym set creation, database cura-
tion, document summarization, and information re-
trieval. Kan et al (2002) use annotated bibliogra-
phies to cover certain aspects of summarization and
suggest using metadata and critical document fea-
tures as well as the prominent content-based features
to summarize documents. Kupiec et al (1995) use a
statistical method and show how extracts can be used
to create summaries but use no annotated metadata
in summarization.
Siddharthan and Teufel (2007) describe a new
reference task and show high human agreement as
well as an improvement in the performance of ar-
gumentative zoning (Teufel, 2005). In argumenta-

classes (Own, Other, Background, Textual, Aim,
Basis, and Contrast) are used to label sentences ac-
cording to their role in the author?s argument.
Our aim is not only to determine the utility of cita-
tion texts for survey creation, but also to examine the
quality distinctions between this form of input and
others such as abstracts and full texts?comparing
the results to human-generated surveys using both
automatic and nugget-based pyramid evaluation
(Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006; Nenkova and Pas-
sonneau, 2004; Lin, 2004).
4 Summarization systems
We used four summarization systems for our
survey-creation approach: Trimmer, LexRank, C-
LexRank, and C-RR. Trimmer is a syntactically-
motivated parse-and-trim approach. LexRank is a
graph-based similarity approach. C-LexRank and C-
RR use graph clustering (?C? stands for clustering).
We describe each of these, in turn, below.
4.1 Trimmer
Trimmer is a sentence-compression tool that extends
the scope of an extractive summarization system by
generating multiple alternative sentence compres-
sions of the most important sentences in target doc-
uments (Zajic et al, 2007). Trimmer compressions
are generated by applying linguistically-motivated
rules to mask syntactic components of a parse of a
source sentence. The rules can be applied iteratively
to compress sentences below a configurable length
threshold, or can be applied in all combinations to
generate the full space of compressions.
Trimmer can leverage the output of any con-
stituency parser that uses the Penn Treebank con-
ventions. At present, the Stanford Parser (Klein and
Manning, 2003) is used. The set of compressions
is ranked according to a set of features that may in-
clude metadata about the source sentences, details of
the compression process that generated the compres-
sion, and externally calculated features of the com-
pression.
Summaries are constructed from the highest scor-
ing compressions, using the metadata and maximal
marginal relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998)
to avoid redundancy and over-representation of a
single source.
4.2 LexRank
We also used LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), a
state-of-the-art multidocument summarization sys-
tem, to generate summaries. LexRank first builds a
graph of all the candidate sentences. Two candidate
sentences are connected with an edge if the similar-
ity between them is above a threshold. We used co-
sine as the similarity metric with a threshold of 0.15.
Once the network is built, the system finds the most
central sentences by performing a random walk on
the graph.
The salience of a node is recursively defined on
the salience of adjacent nodes. This is similar to
the concept of prestige in social networks, where the
prestige of a person is dependent on the prestige of
the people he/she knows. However, since random
walk may get caught in cycles or in disconnected
components, we reserve a low probability to jump
to random nodes instead of neighbors (a technique
suggested by Langville and Meyer (2006)).
Note also that unlike the original PageRank
method, the graph of sentences is undirected. This
updated measure of sentence salience is called as
LexRank. The sentences with the highest LexRank
scores form the summary.
4.3 Cluster Summarizers: C-LexRank, C-RR
Two clustering methods proposed by Qazvinian and
Radev (2008)?C-RR and C-LexRank?were used
to create summaries. Both create a fully connected
network in which nodes are sentences and edges are
cosine similarities. A cutoff value of 0.1 is applied
to prune the graph and make a binary network. The
largest connected component of the network is then
extracted and clustered.
Both of the mentioned summarizers cluster the
network similarly but use different approaches to se-
lect sentences from different communities. In C-
RR sentences are picked from different clusters in
a round robin (RR) fashion. C-LexRank first calcu-
lates LexRank within each cluster to find the most
salient sentences of each community. Then it picks
the most salient sentence of each cluster, and then
the second most salient and so forth until the sum-
mary length limit is reached.

5 Data
The ACL Anthology is a collection of papers from
the Computational Linguistics journal, and proceed-
ings of ACL conferences and workshops. It has
almost 11,000 papers. To produce the ACL An-
thology Network (AAN), Joseph and Radev (2007)
manually parsed the references before automatically
compiling the network metadata, and generating ci-
tation and author collaboration networks. The AAN
includes all citation and collaboration data within
the ACL papers, with the citation network consist-
ing of 11,773 nodes and 38,765 directed edges.
Our evaluation experiments are on a set of papers
in the research area of Question Answering (QA)
and another set of papers on Dependency parsing
(DP). The two sets of papers were compiled by se-
lecting all the papers in AAN that had the words
Question Answering and Dependency Parsing, re-
spectively, in the title and the content. There were
10 papers in the QA set and 16 papers in the DP set.
We also compiled the citation texts for the 10 QA
papers and the citation texts for the 16 DP papers.
6 Experiments
We automatically generated surveys for both QA
and DP from three different types of documents: (1)
full papers from the QA and DP sets?QA and DP
full papers (PA), (2) only the abstracts of the QA
and DP papers?QA and DP abstracts (AB), and
(3) the citation texts corresponding to the QA and
DP papers?QA and DP citations texts (CT).
We generated twenty four (4x3x2) surveys,
each of length 250 words, by applying Trimmer,
LexRank, C-LexRank and C-RR on the three data
types (citation texts, abstracts, and full papers) for
both QA and DP. (Table 1 shows a fragment of one
of the surveys automatically generated from QA ci-
tation texts.) We created six (3x2) additional 250-
word surveys by randomly choosing sentences from
the citation texts, abstracts, and full papers of QA
and DP. We will refer to them as random surveys.
6.1 Evaluation
Our goal was to determine if citation texts do in-
deed have useful information that one will want to
put in a survey and if so, how much of this infor-
mation is not available in the original papers and
their abstracts. For this we evaluated each of the
automatically generated surveys using two separate
approaches: nugget-based pyramid evaluation and
ROUGE (described in the two subsections below).
Two sets of gold standard data were manually cre-
ated from the QA and DP citation texts and abstracts,
respectively:2 (1) We asked two impartial judges to
identify important nuggets of information worth in-
cluding in a survey. (2) We asked four fluent speak-
ers of English to create 250-word surveys of the
datasets. Then we determined how well the differ-
ent automatically generated surveys perform against
these gold standards. If the citation texts have only
redundant information with respect to the abstracts
and original papers, then the surveys of citation texts
will not perform better than others.
6.1.1 Nugget-Based Pyramid Evaluation
For our first approach we used a nugget-based
evaluation methodology (Lin and Demner-Fushman,
2006; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Hildebrandt
et al, 2004; Voorhees, 2003). We asked three impar-
tial annotators (knowledgeable in NLP but not affil-
iated with the project) to review the citation texts
and/or abstract sets for each of the papers in the QA
and DP sets and manually extract prioritized lists
2Creating gold standard data from complete papers is fairly
arduous, and was not pursued.
588
of 2?8 ?nuggets,? or main contributions, supplied
by each paper. Each nugget was assigned a weight
based on the frequency with which it was listed by
annotators as well as the priority it was assigned
in each case. Our automatically generated surveys
were then scored based on the number and weight
of the nuggets that they covered. This evaluation ap-
proach is similar to the one adopted by Qazvinian
and Radev (2008), but adapted here for use in the
multi-document case.
The annotators had two distinct tasks for the QA
set, and one for the DP set: (1) extract nuggets for
each of the 10 QA papers, based only on the citation
texts for those papers; (2) extract nuggets for each
of the 10 QA papers, based only on the abstracts of
those papers; and (3) extract nuggets for each of the
16 DP papers, based only on the citation texts for
those papers.3
We obtained a weight for each nugget by revers-
ing its priority out of 8 (e.g., a nugget listed with
priority 1 was assigned a weight of 8) and summing
the weights over each listing of that nugget.4
To evaluate a given survey, we counted the num-
ber and weight of nuggets that it covered. Nuggets
were detected via the combined use of annotator-
provided regular expressions and careful human re-
view. Recall was calculated by dividing the com-
bined weight of covered nuggets by the combined
weight of all nuggets in the nugget set. Precision
was calculated by dividing the number of distinct
nuggets covered in a survey by the number of sen-
tences constituting that survey, with a cap of 1. F-
measure, the weighted harmonic mean of precision
and recall, was calculated with a beta value of 3 in
order to assign the greatest weight to recall. Recall
is favored because it rewards surveys that include
highly weighted (important) facts, rather than just a
3We first experimented using only the QA set. Then to show
that the results apply to other datasets, we asked human anno-
tators for gold standard data on the DP citation texts. Addi-
tional experiments on DP abstracts were not pursued because
this would have required additional human annotation effort to
establish a point we had already made with the QA set, i.e., that
abstracts are useful for survey creation.
4Results obtained with other weighting schemes that ig-
nored priority ratings and multiple mentions of a nugget by a
single annotator showed the same trends as the ones shown by
the selected weighting scheme, but the latter was a stronger dis-
tinguisher among the four systems.

Table 2 gives the F-measure values of the 250-

surveys were evaluated using the nuggets drawn
from the QA citation texts, QA abstracts, and DP ci-

rightmost column) may be considered a good score
to aim for by the automatic summarization methods.
Table 3 gives the F-measure values of the surveys
generated by the four automatic summarizers, evalu-
ated using nuggets drawn from the QA citation texts,
QA abstracts, and DP citation texts. The table also
includes results for the baseline random summaries.
When we used the nuggets from the abstracts
set for evaluation, the surveys created from ab-
stracts scored higher than the corresponding surveys
created from citation texts and papers. Further, the
best surveys generated from citation texts outscored
the best surveys generated from papers. When we
used the nuggets from citation sets for evaluation,
the best automatic surveys generated from citation
texts outperform those generated from abstracts and
full papers. All these pyramid results demonstrate
that citation texts can contain useful information that
is not available in the abstracts or the original papers,
and that abstracts can contain useful information that
is not available in the citation texts or full papers.
Among the various automatic summarizers, Trim-
mer performed best at this task, in two cases ex-
ceeding the average human performance. Note also
that the random summarizer outscored the automatic
summarizers in cases where the nuggets were taken
from a source different from that used to generate
the survey. However, one or two summarizers still
tended to do well. This indicates a difficulty in ex-

tracting the overlapping survey-worthy information
across the two sources.
6.1.2 ROUGE evaluation
Table 4 presents ROUGE scores (Lin, 2004) of
each of human-generated 250-word surveys against
each other. The average (last column) is what the au-
tomatic surveys can aim for. We then evaluated each
of the random surveys and those generated by the
four summarization systems against the references.
Table 5 lists ROUGE scores of surveys when the
manually created 250-word survey of the QA cita-
tion texts, survey of the QA abstracts, and the survey
of the DP citation texts, were used as gold standard.
When we use manually created citation text
surveys as reference, then the surveys gener-
ated from citation texts obtained significantly bet-
ter ROUGE scores than the surveys generated from
abstracts and full papers (p < 0.05) [RESULT 1].
This shows that crucial survey-worthy information
present in citation texts is not available, or hard to
extract, from abstracts and papers alone. Further,
the surveys generated from abstracts performed sig-
nificantly better than those generated from the full
papers (p < 0.05) [RESULT 2]. This shows that ab-
stracts and citation texts are generally denser in sur-
vey worthy information than full papers.
When we use manually created abstract sur-
veys as reference, then the surveys generated
from abstracts obtained significantly better ROUGE
scores than the surveys generated from citation texts
and full papers (p < 0.05) [RESULT 3]. Further, and
more importantly, the surveys generated from cita-
tion texts performed significantly better than those
generated from the full papers (p < 0.05) [RESULT
4]. Again, this shows that abstracts and citation texts
are richer in survey-worthy information. These re-
sults also show that abstracts of papers and citation
texts have some overlapping information (RESULT
2 and RESULT 4), but they also have a signifi-
cant amount of unique survey-worthy information
(RESULT 1 and RESULT 3).
Among the automatic summarizers, C-LexRank

Table 5: ROUGE-2 scores of automatic surveys of QA and DP data. The surveys are evaluated by using human
references created from QA citation texts (QA?CT), QA abstracts (QA?AB), and DP citation texts (DP?CT). These
results are obtained after Jack-knifing the human references so that the values can be compared to those in Table 4.
* LexRank is computationally intensive and so was not run on the DP full papers set (about 4000 sentences).
mer is better at identifying more useful nuggets of
information, but C-LexRank and LexRank are bet-
ter at producing unigrams and bigrams expected in
a survey. To some extent this may be due to the fact
that Trimmer uses smaller (trimmed) fragments of
source sentences in its summaries.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the usefulness of di-
rectly summarizing citation texts (sentences that cite
other papers) in the automatic creation of technical
surveys. We generated surveys of a set of Ques-
tion Answering (QA) and Dependency Parsing (DP)
papers, their abstracts, and their citation texts us-
ing four state-of-the-art summarization systems (C-
LexRank, C-RR, LexRank, and Trimmer). We then
used two separate approaches, nugget-based pyra-
mid and ROUGE, to evaluate the surveys. The re-
sults from both approaches and all four summa-
rization systems show that both citation texts and
abstracts have unique survey-worthy information.
These results also demonstrate that, unlike single
document summarization (where citing sentences
have been suggested to be inappropriate (Teufel
et al, 2006)), multidocument summarization?
especially technical survey creation?benefits con-
siderably from citation texts.
We next plan to generate surveys using both cita-
tion texts and abstracts together as input. Given the
overlapping content of abstracts and citation texts,
discovered in the current study, it is clear that re-
dundancy detection will be an integral component of
this future work. Creating readily consumable sur-
veys is a hard task, especially when using only raw
text and simple summarization techniques. There-
fore we intend to combine these summarization and
bibliometric techniques with suitable visualization
methods towards the creation of iterative technical
survey tools?systems that present surveys and bib-
liometric links in a visually convenient manner and
which incorporate user feedback to produce even
better surveys.
