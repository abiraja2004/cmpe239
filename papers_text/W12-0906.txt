1 Introduction
Annotated corpora of child language data are
valuable resources for language acquisition stud-
ies, for instance, providing the basis for devel-
opmental comparisons and evaluation of different
hypotheses. For computational investigations an-
notated corpora can serve as an approximation to
the linguistic environment to which a child is ex-
posed, as discussed by Wintner (2010).
Recently there has been a growing number
of initiatives for annotating children?s data for a
number of languages, with for instance, part-of-
speech (PoS) and syntactic information (Sagae et
al., 2010; Buttery and Korhonen, 2007; Yang,
2010) and some of these are available as part of
CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000). For resource
rich languages like English these annotations can
be further extended with detailed information,
for instance, from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
about synonymy, from the MRC Psycholinguistic
Database (Coltheart, 1981) about age of acquisi-
tion, imagery, concreteness and familiarity among
others. However, for many other languages one of
the challenges is in annotating corpora in a con-
text where resources and tools are less abundant
and many are still under development.
In this paper we describe one such initiative, for
annotating the raw Portuguese corpora available
in the CHILDES database with (psycho)linguistic
and distributional information (?2) . It also de-
scribes a modular searching environment for these
corpora that allows complex and flexible searches
that combine different levels of annotation, and
that can be easily extended (?3). We finish with
some conclusions and future work.
2 Resource Description
The Portuguese, CHILDES contains 3 corpora:
? Batore?o (Batoreo, 2000) with 60 narratives,
30 from adults and 30 from children, about
two stories
? Porto Alegre (Guimara?es, 1994; Guimara?es,
1995) with data from 5 to 9 year old children,
collected both cross-sectionally and longitu-
dinally and
? Floriano?polis with the longitudinal data for
one Brazilian child: 5530 utterances in broad
phonetic transcription.
The total number of sentences and words per
age in these corpora is shown in Table 1

In order to annotate the transcribed sentences
in the CHILDES Portuguese corpora we used the
PALAVRAS parser1 (Bick, 2000). It is a statisti-
cal robust Portuguese parser, which always return

manual.html.

at least one analysis even for incomplete or un-
grammatical sentences. This parser has a high ac-
curacy: 99% for part-of-speech and 96-97%. The
parser also has a named entity recognizer (Bick,
2003) and provides some semantic information
for nouns, verbs and adjectives (e.g. organization,
date, place, etc). The annotations process con-
sisted of the following steps:
1. automatic pre-processing for dealing with in-
complete words and removing transcription
notes;
2. tagging and parsing with PALAVRAS
parser;
3. annotation of verbs and nouns with psy-
cholinguistic information like age of acqui-
sition and concreteness from (Cameirao and
Vicente, 2010).
For enabling age related analysis, the sen-
tences were subsequently divided according to the
child?s age reported in each corpus, and annotated
with frequency information collected considering
separately each type of annotation per age.
3 System Description
In order to allow complex searches that combine
information from different levels of annotation
for each age, the sentences were organized in a
database, structured as in Tables 2 and 3, respec-
tively presenting the structure of words and sen-
tences).

Using a web environment, a user can choose
any combination of fields in the database to per-
form a query. It is possible to examine, for in-
stance, the usage of a particular word and its evo-
lution according to grammatical class per age.
The environment provides two modes for
queries: an expert mode, where database queries
can be dynamically specified selecting the rele-
vant fields, and a guided mode which contains
predefined query components and a set of filters
that users can combine in the queries. The results
are available both as a file containing the relevant
annotated sentences for further processing, or in
a graphical form. The latter shows a chart of fre-
quency per age, which can be displayed in terms
of absolute or relative values.
The guided mode provides an iterative way for
query construction where the user selects a rele-
vant field (e.g. age of acquisition) at a time and
adds it to the query until all desired fields have
been added, when the resulting query is saved.
The user can repeat this process to create com-
bined queries and at the end of the process can
chose the form for outputting the result (graphic
or file).
4 Conclusion
This paper describes the (psycho)linguistic and
distributional annotation of the Portuguese cor-
pora in CHILDES, and presents an environment
for searching them. This environment allows
complex searches combining multiple levels of
annotation to be created even by non-expert users.
Therefore this initiative not only produced an in-
tegrated and rich annotation schema so far lack-
ing for these corpora, but also provided a modular
environment for structuring and searching them
through a more user friendly interface. As next
steps we foresee the extension of the annotation
using other resources. We also plan to add cor-
pora for other languages to the environment, such
as English and Spanish.
