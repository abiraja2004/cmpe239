Coordinate con junct ion  i s  any important  device fo r  
express ing  complex in fo rmat ion .  To provide a hab i tab le  langua-  
ge process ing system, most app l i ca t ions  requ i re  some t reatment  
of con junct ion .  When a r i ch  con junct ion  mechanism i s  in t roduc-  
ed to account fo r  the wide var ie ty  of conJotn ings  found in  
cont inuous text  (as opposed to quer ies ) ,  i t  a l so  becomes c ruc -  
ia l  to res t r i c t  the parses obta ined  for  the o0n Jo in ings ,  s ince  
con~nct ion  i s  a major source of ambigui ty  in  pars ing .  For 
example, the sequence of syntact i c  c lasses :  
NO~N PREPOSITION NOUN and NOUN 
has two poss ib le  pareeez 
NOUN I~%EPOSITION (NOUN and NOUN) 
swelling of (hands and feet) 
I NOUN PREPOSITION NOUN) and NOUN swelling of hands) and fever 
The choice of the correct parse depends on applyin~ 
domain-spec i f i c  const rs /n ts  to determine which words "go to -  
gether" best .  The concept of oon Junot iona l  compat ib i l i ty  de-  
pends on semant i~ psxa l le l iam between the con jo ined  e lements!  
thus, in the first example, hands and feet are more semantic- 
ally parallel than swellln~ and feet. Although it is possible 
to write special rules to define allowable con~oln~ngs for a 
partlaular domain of application, this would mean that the

system would not be por tab le :  the con junct ion  const ra in ts  
would have to be rewr i t ten  fo r  each new domain. I t  i s ,  how- 
ever ,  poss ib le  to  fo rmula te  a genera l  domain- independent 
p r inc ip le  to capture con junct ion  const ra in ts .  This  paper w i l l  
descr ibe  such a pr inc ip le ,  implemented as "con junct ion  re -  
s t r i c t ions"  w i th in  the genera l  t reatment  of  con junct ion  in  
the natura l  language process ing  system of  the  L ingu is t i c  
S t r ing  P ro jec t  parser .  The i l l us t ra t ive  examples are  drawn 
from actua l  text  occur rences  in  hosp i ta l  d i scharge  sunnnaries, 
processed us ing the mechanisms descr ibed  below, as we l l  as 
from some bu i ld ing  code spec i f i ca t ions ,  a l so  processed wi th  
the LSP system. 
The f i r s t  ru le  of  con Junct iona l  compat ib i l i ty  i s  s imply:  
Two con jo ined nouns must be long to the  same (domain- 
specific) semantic class, 
This rule will produce the correct parse for the two previous 
examples, swellin~ of hands and feet and swe l l i~  of hands 
and fever. Hands and fee_._~t are both BODY-PART words in the 
first example, while swellin~ is not; in the second example, 
swellin~ and feve.._...rr are both SIGN.SYMPTOM words. 
In  o rder  to  determine con Junct iona l  compat ib i l i ty ,  the 
noun con juncts  are  compared pa i rw ise!  each con junct  i s  in i -  
t i a l l y  ass igned a l i s t  cons i s t ing  o f  i t s  semant ic  c lass (es ) .  
(Most words belong to  Jus t  one semant ic  c lass !  however, cer -  
ta in  lex ica l ly  ambiguous wo~ds belong to two or  more c lasses ,  
as i l l us t ra ted  be low.)  The in tersect ion  o f  the two l i s t s  of  
semant ic  c lasses  i s  then computed. I f  the in tersect ion  i s  not 
empty, then the  con jo in ing  i s  a l lowed,  and the in tersect ion  
rep laces  the or ig ina l  l i s t  of  c lasses  assoc ia ted  w i th  each 
con junct .  This serves  as a record  of a~v d isambignat ion  that  
occurs  as a resu l t  of  computing oon Junct ions l  compat ib i l i ty .  
For  example, d i scharge  i s  lex ica l l y  ambiguous in  medical  
nar ra t ive :  i t  be longs  to the ~DICAL-ACT c lass ,  as in :

INITIAL LISTS (INST) (MEDICALvACT) (MEDICALvACT,SIGN- 
s~su~oM) 
AFTER CONJ. (INST) (KEDICAL-ACT) (MEDICAL-ACT) 
whereas i t  has the SIGN-SYMPTOM read ing  in  the phrase:  
no b leed ing  or  d i scharge  
I~TIAL LISTS (SI~-SYM~OM) (~DICA'-ACToSION-S~U~O~) 
AW~ CONJ. (SI~W-S~U~OM) (S IGN-S~OM) 
Thus oomputin~ con junct ion  compat ib i l i ty  a l so  prov ides  a 
record  of  the cor rec t  read ing  when a con junct  i s  lex ica l !y  
ambiguous. 
The conJuBct ion ru le  does not account  fo r  the  fac t  that  
cer ta in  noun phrases have a semant ic  c lass  d i f fe rent  f r . - .  
that  of  the i r  head noun. Cons ider  the  fo l low ing  phrase from 
a bu i ld ing  code text :  
bu l ld in~s  and por t ions  of  bu i ld ings  
BLDG PART BLDG 
In this case, the head noun~ portion is "transparent" to its 
prepositional modifier, of buildln~se That is, the phrase 
portion of buildln~s really has a distribution characteristic 
of the word buildlnK. If we could disregard the word portions 
of and look instead at the noun in the prepositional phrase, 
namely buildin~ with class BLDG, then the conjunction rule 
would apply correctly. We call this type of construction the 
"computed attribute" oonstructlon, because, in its most gene- 
ral form, the semant ic  c lass  fo r  an ent i re  phrase i s  computed 
from the  in teract ion  of  the semant ic  c lass  of  the head noun 
and the o lass (es )  of  i t s  mod i f ie rs .  
The computed a t t r ibute  const ruc t ion  tu rns  out  to  be 
character i s t i c  of a se t  of  Eng l i sh  semantic c lasses  common to 
ma~7 domains. These c lasses  inc lude  the c lasses  AMOUNT, 
PERIOD, BEGINNING, ENDING, FREQUENCY, e tc .  To handle these

the  c lass  o f  the  mod i f ie r  and b inds  the  mod i f ie r  to  the  head 
noun,  so that  the  mod i f ie r  does  not  d i s t r ibute  over  the  o ther
