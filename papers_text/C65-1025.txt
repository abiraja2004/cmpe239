SUY~I~RY. A remarkable regularity of distribution of 
Arabic verbal roots in the vocabulary is shown to 
exist. Presented results sugsest that similar resular 
distributions of semantic units in other languages 
may be found with the help of word formation rules 
and vocabulary statistics. Possible applications in 
approaching the problem of "true" multiple meaning 
in MT are being discussed. 
The notion of "semantic unit" may be formulated in 
several ways /I/ so that the application of this term makes its 
explicit definition indispensable. It seems that difficulties in 
definin~ it arise from the fact that llke most general terms it 
should be related to some deflnlte theory. At present we do not 
possess any sufficiently strong and ~eneral theory of the semantics 
of natural languages~ though important preliminary steps in this 
direction have already been made /2/. For this reason most seman- 
tic investigations of natural languages still preserve the 
"artlsanllke" character stressed by LI.Coyoud and all definitions 
of the semantlo notions remain rather tentat ive -  as well as all 
the more ~eneral conclusions drawn from such investlg~tlons. 
ThIs~ too~ holds true for the present contrlbution, in which an 
empirical fact is described and some remarks on its possible 
applications to the problem of the "~rue" multiple meanln~ have 
been made.

Skalmowski  - 2 
For this paper it seems advisable to hold apart two 
notions: that of the "concept" and that of the "semantic uz~it". 
Given a generat ive  descr lpt ional  device G z~rammar/ and a pro-  
Jective system of the type proposed by Katz and Fodor S /sem~n- 
tics/ we can descr ibe a semantic concept in a lan~ua~'e L as 
a set of n-tuples of symbo ls  from G and S~ ordered or par- 
t ial ly ordered by the relat ions which def ine the formal rules of 
these systems~ and having a common der ivat ion in S. This broad 
frame al~ows us to re~,:ard as a oonoe~t e~ery dict ion ..... - , ~ ~u~ er~try - 
except for the "grammatica l  words" v:hich do not i)ossess any de- 
r ivations in C - and leaves us a wide mar~in of f reedeou in 
-~, v oonoelt -systems:: ',viti~ a i,rio~i estab- construot in~ arb_t,at~ '~ 
lished features. 
In a s imi lar  way we may descr ibe a sei;mntic unit 
as a set of n-tuples of G-symbols,  G-rules of word formation 
and S-symbols~ ordered or part ia l ly  ordered by means of rela-  
tions wI~ich def ine the formal rules of these systems~ and ' ...... 
a common der ivat ion  in  ~ f rom some J - symoo l  un ique!y  re la ted  l j \ [  
to  some S -symbo l .  Th is  a l lows  us  to  re la te  w i th  t i~e not ion  o f  
a semantic unit the l inguist ic  not ions of morpheme /or mere 
strictly: semanteme/  and of "word family"~ defined in terms of 
grammat ica l  der ivat ions.  
The thessur lc ai?proach to the problem of meaning 
in fit /s .e .g .3/  pays trlbut to the idea of ordering the symbols 
? c~l^ within the conoel~ts~ but at the same time it brings to I~ L~t 
the Droblem of mult ip le meaning. This problem has been much 
discussed already /s.e.g.4/,  but it is st i l l  far from being 
f~ solved in al l  its aspects ~,.eneral!y sl) ~ '~" - . a~.In,.-, the main d i f f icu l -  
Skalnmwski - 3 
ty arises from the fact that the "concept-systems" of lansua~es 
are not isomorphic and even if we manage to brinS tk, e~u closer 
to,sether there remains some amount of "looseness" within the 
concepts themselves, giving. rise to the problem of "true" mul- 
tiple meaning. The "contextual" multiple ~nea~Jin.~ inay be resolved 
- in l)rinciple~ at least - by extending the notion of concepts 
both "in the source and i~ the tarfet languages to ,:holt sentences 
or even lar&~er utterances) this is allowed by our :' broad:' 
treatment of this notion, not s!',eoifyin S the maximal size of 
the n-tu/~les of symbols. By this extension the inner structure 
of concepts makes the relations defining the isomorphism of the 
"concept -systems" more apparent i thus even such cases as the 
adequate translation of the ~\[ussian ~@M?~eas  the English 
':ohangin~ /the order of intezration/"and "varying /argument/" 
are theoretical ly resolvable. Yet there exist instances w?,ere 
the extension of concept would have to go beyond limits and to 
involve the whole !un.~fuage: these are c6~ses of :'stylistic' 
difference in v;hich there are not ai)parent reasons for choosin:i 
one o.? the fossible s$,nonyms instead of the ct~\]er but \';ilere t~e 
difference ia dist inctly felt by competent bil ingual speakers. 
ri'he !)z-oblem is important for the translation of literary pieces, 
especia l ly  i)oetr~:) b$' the \])resent stal\]d of .,iT it is still an 
;'acade~:\]ic" p~oiJlem, of course~ but it exists after all. it ~.lay 
be best i l lustrated by the question whether t~ere are "better;: 
and '~worse ~T translations of nonsensical expressions~ such as the 
famops ';furiously sleel)ing ideas". Le6ative ans'~'Jer would mean 
that every translation is equally sood~ ~,;hioh in turn would i.lean 
that o~:ly "meaningful" sentences are translatable~ in that case 
I 
Ska imowski - 4 
the i,!T problems would be "enriched" with the whole load of phi-  
losophioal  quest ions - an embarassing development~ certainly. 
Vaguely felt d i f ferences between the intr insic 
"semantic values" of d i f ferent  elements of language have given 
rise to the not ions of "size" or "content" of Semantic elements 
/5/ and several  attempts - both to define these notions and to 
furnish models of the under ly ing ~,~eohanism \[~ave been ,,~r~e /p~6/. 
The m~in assumpt ion - based on observat ions of ,lillis -','as 
that there existed a "nat-ral  hierarchy" of concepts in natural  
languages~ forming a tree or at least a latt ice with some de- 
f inite stat is t ica l  propert ies.  
The ipresent Daper gives some results of an in- 
vest':.S,,':'tion undertaken in order to test this hy;?o,-,eses.~ 
Because of the marvelous clarity of the grai-,Imatical structure 
~rabic has been chosen as a " laboratory exar,\])7~le ~'. ~,bout 90',~ of 
Arabic semantemes are verbal  roots~ with very fev~ exceft!o:~s 
consist ing of three consonants CI-C>-CD; the usual dict ionary 
form is the 3 d i~ers, as. masc. Derf of the form '~ ~ ~ ~ ? ~ la"',cuCDa ' s .  ," 
kasara "to break" /lit. '~he has broken"/. There are more than 
ten di f ferent verbal  stem-patterns i.e. word formation rules~ 
modyfy ing the basic meaning of the root in a s~,eoif!c way; 
thus the stem-pattern Ii: C la~2~zaC3a adds to ti~e ~)ssio 
meaning the shade of intensity, e.E. kasara ~to breei: t~ ~ ..... u~sar& 
~ ~.~u iV -  causative~ "to smash"; the stem-pattern ~i~ is conative~ t '-~ 
etc. 
i~ll the tr i l i t~,~l  veto-' al roots ir~ ~-'une ~rab:Lc 
vocabul~,--~,zo have bee~l div?ded into se"arate, classos_ according to 
their abi l i ty to forn s = I~,, ~...~ n d. i . i . fe ren  s te,,:s c onlj 
I 
the number of stem-patterns was considered and further ai<'licab!e 
word formation rules /substantivisat ions~ adjeot iv isat ions etc./ 
were disregarded this classif ication is a ver~, rough approxi-  
mation to the h~i~othetical underlying hierarci~. It ha~ been 
assumecL that the number of stem-l~atterns definin,~ a given class 
al .pro~m~tely viewed as an exponent of the '"oo~Itent ~ or 
~'semantio value" of the semantic units belongin~ to tkis class 
and that - if the hypothetical  hierarchy was really based on 
this principle - the number of roots with greater s should be 
smaller than that with smaller s. 3aranov's Arabic-Russian 
Diotionar~ /7/ has been used for countin& the roots and it has 
been found that the relation between s /the number of stem- 
-patterns oharacter lz ln~ the given class/ and r /the number of 
roots belonging to this class/ was not only inversly proportional 
but also nearly functional and that the distr ibution of roots in 
the Arabic vocabulary may be described as a simple function 
r/s/ = i'~/As ~ +De +C/~ where \[~ is the sum-total of roots and 
. c odness of fit has been ~ B and C are specif ic constants ~q~e ~o 
tested by the ohi-square distr ibution and it has been found that 
the differences between the empirical data a~d the theoretical 
distr ibution - except for one value - do not exceed 0.3 signif ic- 
ance level.  
In order to estimate the possible differences 
between ~,artioular diotionarir~s -wil ioh could arise from 
differences between the materials used for their compilation - 
two samples of ca. 700 items each have been taken from two 
different d io t ionar les  /7~8/ and the distr ibution of roots in 
them compared with each other and with the over-al l  distribution. 
Skalmowski - 6 
Al l  the distr ibutions show a striking similarity, renderin~ 
nearly identical chl-square values, x/ 
This result is a strong argument for the general val idity of tue 
discussed distr ibution in Arabic -and  this fact in its turn 
speaks in favour of the existence of "natural hierarchies" of 
the semantic units in general.

It seems very probable that similar regular dis- 
tr ibutions might be found in other languages, too - perhaps the 
ensemble of the "semantic parameters" would have to be much 
wider and the "trial and error" investigations would require 
more time but the whole work can be easily mechanised. The idea 
of interconnections between the syntactic and semantic structures 
of language is not new in structural l inguistics /s.9 and 10/ 
and investigations alon~ these lines have already been led in 
the domain of computational l inguistics under direction of 
P.Garvin /11/. My suggestions go towards discovering such regular 
Skalmowski - 7 
distr ibut ions which would faci l itate the task of f inding more 
strict correlations between the synonyms within \[)articular con- 
cepts on computational basis. The underlying assumption is that 
the "universes of disoours" in various languages are of about 
the same "size" /whatever it would mean - but such an assumption 
is tacitely made in every translation/~ and that the semantic 
units underlying the components of concepts are ordered 
aocordin~ to their "content"~ so that the problem of "true" 
multiple meaning in certain oases ;nay be solved by means of 
matching the components of concepts o f  the source and target 
languages on the basis of their ':semantic value". 
As an i l lustration let us consider a fev: equivalent

i.e. according to our assumi)tion kavin L about the sa,le

The applied "method" bein~ unsystematic and ad hoc 
the example allows no general lsations but it may i l lustrate our 
argument that the problem o f '~ue"  multiple meaninz arises in 
cases of "expressive language" from the fact that even when the 
concepts of source and target languages a~;ree there  is no 
correlation between their respective oom~onents e~oept for 
differences between their "value", based on differences on ti.e 
paradigmatic level. Titus e.g. for the concept "aplplyins heat on 
solnething '~ two different semantic units could have been 
arbitrari ly chosen by t~e two interpreters, as they reEarded th 
subsets of synonyms within the concepts as unordered.. iF 
suggestion is that these subsets might be at least ~art?ally 
ordered by means of the intril\]sic value of the semantic u~its 
underlyin~ them and that correlations between them might be 
established in more objective terms of numeric measures of their 
content.
