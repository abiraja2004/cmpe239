Abstract
The extensive use of Multiword Expressions
(MWE) in natural language texts prompts
more detailed studies that aim for a more ade-
quate treatment of these expressions. A MWE
typically expresses concepts and ideas that
usually cannot be expressed by a single word.
Intuitively, with the appropriate treatment of
MWEs, the results of an Information Retrieval
(IR) system could be improved. The aim of
this paper is to apply techniques for the au-
tomatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to
index them as a single unit. Experimental re-
sults show improvements on the retrieval of
relevant documents when identifying MWEs
and treating them as a single indexing unit.
1 Introduction
One of the motivations of this work is to investi-
gate if the identification and appropriate treatment
of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an applica-
tion contributes to improve results and ultimately
lead to more precise man-machine interaction. The
term ?multiword expression? has been used to de-
scribe a large set of distinct constructions, for in-
stance support verbs, noun compounds, institution-
alized phrases and so on. Calzolari et al (2002) de-
fines MWEs as a sequence of words that acts as a
single unit at some level of linguistic analysis.
The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous
and each of the different classes has specific char-
acteristics, posing a challenge to the implementa-
tion of mechanisms that provide unified treatment
for them. For instance, even if a standard system ca-
pable of identifying boundaries between words, i.e.
a tokenizer, may nevertheless be incapable of recog-
nizing a sequence of words as an MWEs and treat-
ing them as a single unit if necessary (e.g. to kick the
bucket meaning to die). For an NLP application to
be effective, it requires mechanisms that are able to
identify MWEs, handle them and make use of them
in a meaningful way (Sag et al, 2002; Baldwin et
al., 2003). It is estimated that the number of MWEs
in the lexicon of a native speaker of a language has
the same order of magnitude as the number of sin-
gle words (Jackendoff, 1997). However, these ra-
tios are probably underestimated when considering
domain-specific language, in which the specialized
vocabulary and terminology are composed mostly
by MWEs.
In this paper, we perform an application-oriented
evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into
an Information Retrieval (IR) system. IR systems
aim to provide users with quick access to data
they are interested (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
1999). Although language processing is not vi-
tal to modern IR systems, it may be convenient
(Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP tech-
niques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for
indexing as single units in the IR system. The se-
lection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor
for the quality of IR systems. In an ideal system,
the index terms should correspond to the concepts
found in the documents. If indexing is performed
only with the atomic terms, there may be a loss of
semantic content of the documents. For example, if
the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the
terms were indexed individually, the relevant docu-
ments may not be retrieved and the system would
101
return instead irrelevant documents about celestial
bodies or carbonated drinks. In order to investigate
the effects of indexing of MWEs for IR, the results
of queries are analyzed using IR quality metrics.
This paper is structured as follows: in section
2 we discuss briefly MWEs and some of the chal-
lenges they represent. This is followed in section 3
by a discussion of the materials and methods em-
ployed in this paper, and in section 4 of the evalu-
ation performed. We finish with some conclusions
and future work.
2 Multiword Expressions
The concept of Multiword Expression has been
widely viewed as a sequence of words that acts as a
single unit at some level of linguistic analysis (Cal-
zolari et al, 2002), or as Idiosyncratic interpreta-
tions that cross word boundaries (or spaces) (Sag
et al, 2002).
One of the great challenges of NLP is the identifi-
cation of such expressions, ?hidden? in texts of var-
ious genres. The difficulties encountered for identi-
fying Multiword Expressions arise for reasons like:
? the difficulty to find the boundaries of a multi-
word, because the number of component words
may vary, or they may not always occur in a
canonical sequence (e.g. rock the boat, rock the
seemingly intransigent boat and the bourgeois
boat was rocked);
? even some of the core components of an MWE
may present some variation (e.g. throw NP to
the lions/wolves/dogs/?birds/?butterflies);
? in a multilingual perspective, MWEs of a
source language are often not equivalent to
their word-by-word translation in the target lan-
guage (e.g. guarda-chuva in Portuguese as um-
brella in English and not as ?store rain).
The automatic discovery of specific types of
MWEs has attracted the attention of many re-
searchers in NLP over the past years. With the recent
increase in efficiency and accuracy of techniques for
preprocessing texts, such as tagging and parsing,
these can become an aid in improving the perfor-
mance of MWE detection techniques. In terms of
practical MWE identification systems, a well known
approach is that of Smadja (1993), who uses a set
of techniques based on statistical methods, calcu-
lated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in
corpora. This approach is implemented in a lexico-
graphic tool called Xtract. More recently there has
been the release of the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al,
2010) for the automatic extraction of MWEs from
monolingual corpora, that both generates and vali-
dates MWE candidates. As generation is based on
surface forms, for the validation, a series of crite-
ria for removing noise are provided, including some
(language independent) association measures such
as mutual information, dice coefficient and maxi-
mum likelihood. Several other researchers have pro-
posed a number of computational techniques that
deal with the discovery of MWEs: Baldwin and
Villavicencio (2002) for verb-particle constructions,
Pearce (2002) and Evert and Krenn (2005) for col-
locations, Nicholson and Baldwin (2006) for com-
pound nouns and many others.
For our experiments, we used some standard sta-
tistical measures such as mutual information, point-
wise mutual information, chi-square, permutation
entropy (Zhang et al, 2006), dice coefficient, and
t-test to extract MWEs from a collection of docu-
ments (i.e. we consider the collection of documents
indexed by the IR system as our corpus).
3 Materials and Methods
Based on the hypothesis that the MWEs can improve
the results of IR systems, we carried out an evalua-
tion experiment. The goal of our evaluation is to
detect differences between the quality of the stan-
dard IR system, without any treatment for MWEs,
and the same system improved with the identifica-
tion of MWEs in the queries and in the documents.
In this section we describe the different resources
and methods used in the experiments.
3.1 Resources and Tools
For this evaluation we used two large newspaper cor-
pora, containing a high diversity of terms:
? Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, USA - 1994)
? The Herald (Glasgow, Scotland - 1995)
Together, both corpora cover a large set of sub-
jects present in the news published by these newspa-
102
pers in the years listed. The language used is Amer-
ican English, in the case of the Los Angeles Times
and British English, in the case of The Herald. Here-
after, the corpus of the Los Angeles Times will be re-
ferred as LA94 and The Herald as GH95. Together,
they contain over 160,000 news articles (Table 1)
and each news article is considered as a document.
Corpus Documents
LA94 110.245
GH95 56.472
Total 166.717
Table 1: Total documents
The collection of documents, as well as the query
topics and the list of relevance judgments (which
will be discussed afterwards), were prepared in the
context of the CLEF 2008 (Cross Language Eval-
uation Forum), for the task entitled Robust-WSD
(Acosta et al, 2008). This task aimed to explore
the contribution of the disambiguation of words to
bilingual or monolingual IR. The task was to as-
sess the validity of word-sense disambiguation for
IR. Thus, the documents in the corpus have been an-
notated by a disambiguation system. The structure
of a document contains information about the identi-
fier of a term in a document (TERM ID), the lemma
of a term (LEMA) and also its morphosyntactic tag
(POS). In addition, it contains the form in which the
term appeared in the text (WF) and information of the
term in the WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998)
as SYNSET SCORE and CODE, both not used for
the experiment. An example of the representation of
a term in the document is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Structure of a term in the original documents
In this paper, we extracted the terms located in
the LEMA attribute, in other words, in their canonical
form (e.g. letter bomb for letter bombs). The use of
lemmas and not the words (e.g. write for wrote, writ-
ten, etc.) to the formation of the corpus, avoids lin-
guistic variations that can affect the results of the ex-
periments. As a results, our documents were formed
only by lemmas and the next step is the indexing
of documents using an IR system. For this task we
used a tool called Zettair (Zettair, 2008), which is a
compact textual search engine that can be used both
for the indexing and for querying text collections.
Porter?s Stemmer (Porter, 1997) as implemented in
Zettair was also used. Stemming can provide further
conflation of related terms. For example, bomb and
bombing were not merged in the lemmatized texts
but after stemming they are conflated to a single rep-
resentation.
After indexing, the next step is the preparation of
the query topics. Just as the corpus, only the lemmas
of the query topics were extracted and used. The test
collection has a total of 310 query topics. The judg-
ment of whether a document is relevant to a query
was assigned according to a list of relevant docu-
ments, manually prepared and supplied with the ma-
terial provided by CLEF. We used Zettair to generate
the ranked list of documents retrieved in response
to each query. For each query topic, the 1,000 top
scoring documents were selected. We used the co-
sine metric to calculate the scores and rank the doc-
uments.
Finally, to calculate the retrieval evaluation met-
rics (detailed in Section 3.5) we used the tool trec
eval. This tool compares the list of retrieved docu-
ments (obtained from Zettair) against the list of rel-
evant documents (provided by CLEF).
3.2 Multiword Expression as Single Terms
In this work, we focused on MWEs composed of
exactly two words (i.e. bigrams). In order to incor-
porate MWEs as units for the IR system to index,
we adopted a very simple heuristics that concate-
nated together all terms composing an MWE using
? ? (e.g. letter bomb as letter bomb). Figure 2 ex-
emplifies this concatenation. Each bigram present in
a predefined dictionary and occurring in a document
is treated as a single term, for indexing and retrieval
purposes. The rationale was that documents contain-
ing specific MWEs can be indexed more adequately
than those containing the words of the expression
separately. As a result, retrieval quality should in-
crease.

3.3 Multiword Expressions Dictionaries
In order to determine the impact of the quality of
the dictionary used in the performance of the IR sys-
tem, we examined several different sources of MWE
of varying quality. The dictionaries containing the
MWEs to be inserted into the corpus as a single
term, are created by a number of techniques involv-
ing automatic and manual extraction. Below we de-
scribe how these MWE dictionaries were created.
? Compound Nouns (CN) - for the creation of
this dictionary, we extracted all bigrams con-
tained in the corpus. Since the number of avail-
able bigrams was very large (99,744,811 bi-
grams) we filtered them using the information
in the original documents, the morphosyntactic
tags. Along with the LEMA field, extracted in
the previous procedure, we also extracted the
value of the field POS (part-of-speech). In or-
der to make the experiment feasible, we used
only bigrams formed by compound nouns, in
other words, when the POS of both words was
NN (Noun). Thus, with bigrams consisting
of sequences of NN as a preprocessing step
to eliminate noise that could affect the exper-
iment, the number of bigrams with MWE can-
didates was reduced to 308,871. The next step
was the selection of bigrams that had the high-
est frequency in the text, so we chose candi-
dates occurring at least ten times in the whole
corpus. As a result, the first list of MWEs was
composed by 15,001 bigrams, called D1.
? Best Compound Nouns - after D1, we re-
fined the list with the use of statistical methods.
The methods used were the mutual information
and chi-square. It was necessary to obtain fre-
quency values from Web using the search tool
Yahoo!, because despite the number of terms
in the corpus, it was possible that the newspa-
per genre of our corpus would bias the counts.
For this work we used the number of pages
in which a term occurs as a measure of fre-
quency. With the association measures based
on web frequencies, we generated a ranking in
decreasing order of score for each entry. We
merged the rankings by calculating the average
rank between the positions of each MWE; the
first 7,500 entries composed the second dictio-
nary, called D2.
? Worst Compound Nouns - this dictionary was
created from bigrams that have between five
and nine occurrences and are more likely to co-
occur by chance. It was created in order to
evaluate whether the choice of the potentially
more noisy MWEs entailed a negative effect in
the results of IR, compared to the previous dic-
tionaries. The third dictionary, with 17,328 bi-
grams, is called D3.
? Gold Standard - this was created from a sub-
list of the Cambridge International Dictionary
of English (Procter, 1995), containing MWEs.
Since this list contains all types of MWEs,
it was necessary to further filter these to ob-
tain compound nouns only, using morphosyn-
tactic information obtained by the TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1994), which for English is reported
to have an accuracy of 96.36%? (Schmid,
1994). Formed by 568 MWEs, the fourth dic-
tionary will be called D4.
? Decision Tree - created from the use of the
J48 algorithm (Witten and Frank, 2000) from
Weka (Hall et al, 2009), a data mining tool.
With this algorithm it is possible to make a
MWE classifier in terms of a decision tree. This
requires providing training data with true and
false examples of MWE. The training set con-
tained 1,136 instances, half true (D4) and half
false MWEs (taken from D3). After combining
several statistical methods, the best result for
classification was obtained with the use of mu-
tual information, chi-square, pointwise mutual
information, and Dice. The model obtained
from Weka was applied to test data containing
15,001 MWE candidates (D1). The 12,782 bi-
grams classified as true compose the fifth dic-
104
tionary, called D5.
? Manual - for comparative purposes, we also
created two dictionaries by manually evaluat-
ing the text of the 310 query topics. The first
dictionary contained all bigrams which would
achieve a different meaning if the words were
concatenated (e.g. space shuttle). This dictio-
nary, was called D6 and contains 254 expres-
sions. The other one was created by a spe-
cialist (linguist) who classified as true or false
a list of MWE candidates from the query top-
ics. The linguist selection of MWEs formed D7
with 178 bigrams.
3.4 Creating Indices
For the experiments, we needed to manipulate the
corpus in different ways, using previously built dic-
tionaries. The MWEs from dictionaries have been
inserted in the corpus as single terms, as described
before. For each dictionary, an index was created in
the IR system. These indices are described below:
1. Baseline (BL) - corpus without MWE.
2. Compound Nouns (CN) - with 15 MWEs of
D1.
3. Best CN (BCN) - with 7,500 MWEs of D2.
4. Worst CN (WCN) - with 17,328 MWEs of D3.
5. Gold Standard (GS) - with 568 MWEs of D4.
6. Decision Tree (DT) - with 12,782 MWEs of
D5.
7. Manual 1 (M1) - with 254 MWEs of D6.
8. Manual 2 (M2) - with 178 MWEs of D7.
3.5 Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the results of the IR system, we need
to use metrics that estimate how well a user?s query
was satisfied by the system. IR evaluation is based
on recall and precision. Precision (Eq. 1) is the por-
tion of the retrieved documents which is actually rel-
evant to the query. Recall (Eq. 2) is the fraction
of the relevant documents which is retrieved by the
IRS.
Precision(P ) =
#Relevant
?
#Retrieved
#Retrieved
(1)
Recall(R) =
#Relevant
?
#Retrieved
#Relevant
(2)
Precision and Recall are set-based measures,
therefore, they do not take into consideration the or-
dering in which the relevant items were retrieved.
In order to evaluate ranked retrieval results the most
widely used measurement is the average precision
(AvP ). AvP emphasizes returning more relevant
documents earlier in the ranking. For a set of
queries, we calculate the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) according to Equation 3 (Manning et al,
2008).
MAP (Q) =
1
|Q|
|Q|?
j=1
1
mj
mj?
k=1
P (Rjk) (3)
where |Q| is the number of queries, Rjk is the set
of ranked retrieval results from the top result until
document dk, and mj is the number of relevant doc-
uments for query j.
4 Experiment and Evaluations
The experiments performed evaluate the insertion of
MWEs in results obtained in the IR system. The
analysis is divided into two evaluations: (A) total
set of query topics, where an overview is given of
the MWE insertion effects and (B) topics modified
by MWEs, where we evaluate only the query topics
that contain MWEs.
4.1 Evaluation A
This evaluation investigates the effects of inserting
MWEs in documents and queries. After each type
of index was generated, MWEs were also included
in the query topics, in accordance to the dictionar-
ies used for each index (for Baseline BL, the query
topics had no modifications).
With eight corpus variations, we obtained indi-
vidual results for each one of them. The results
presented in Table 2 were summarized by the ab-
solute number of relevant documents retrieved and
105
the MAP for the entire set of query topics. In total,
6,379 relevant documents are returned for the 310
query topics.
Index Rel. Retrieved MAP
BL 3,967 0.1170
CN 4,007 0.1179
BCN 3,972 0.1156
WCN 3,982 0.1150
GS 3,980 0.1193
DT 4,002 0.1178
M1 4,064 0.1217
M2 4,044 0.1205
Table 2: Results ? Evaluation A.
It is possible to see a small improvement in the
results for the indices M1 and M2 in relation to the
baseline (BL). This happens because the choice of
candidate MWEs was made from the contents of the
document topics and not, as with other indices, from
the whole corpus. Considering the indices built with
MWEs extracted from the corpus, the best result is
index GS.In second place, comes the CN index, with
a subtle improvement over the Baseline. BL surpris-
ingly got a better result than the Best and Worst CN.
The loss in retrieval quality as a result from MWE
identification for BCN was not expected.
When comparing the gain or loss in MAP of indi-
vidual query topics, we can see how the index BCN
compares to the Baseline: BCN had better MAP in
149 and worse MAP in 108 cases. However, the av-
erage loss is higher than the average gain, this ex-
plains why BL obtains a better result overall. In or-
der do decide if one run is indeed superior to an-
other, instead of using the absolute MAP value, we
chose to calculate a margin of 5%. The intuition
behind this is that in IR, a difference of less than
5% between the results being compared is not con-
sidered significant (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000).
To be considered as gain the difference between the
values resulting from two different indices for the
same query topic should be greater than 5%. Differ-
ences of less than 5% are considered ties. This way,
MAP values of 0.1111 and 0.1122 are considered
ties. Given this margin, we can see in Tables 3 and
4 that the indices BCN and WCN are better com-
pared to the baseline. In the case of BCN, the gain
is almost 20% of cases and the WCN, the difference
between gain and loss is less than 2%.
Gain 60 19.35%
Loss 35 11.29%
Ties 215 69.35%
Total 310 100.00%
Difference between Gain and Loss 8,06%
Table 3: BCN x Baseline
Gain 26 8.39%
Loss 21 6.77%
Ties 263 84.84%
Total 310 100.00%
Difference between Gain and Loss 1.61%
Table 4: WCN x Baseline
Finally, this first experiment guided us toward
a deeper evaluation of the query topics that have
MWEs, because there is a possibility that the MWE
insertions in documents can decrease the accuracy
of the system on topics that have no MWE.
4.2 Evaluation B
This evaluation studies in detail the effects on the
document retrieval in response to topics in which
there were MWEs. For this purpose, we used the
same indices used before and we performed an in-
dividual evaluation of the topics, to obtain a better
understanding on where the identification of MWEs
improves or degrades the results.
As each dictionary was created using a different
methodology, the number of expressions contained
in each dictionary is also different. Thus, for each
method, the number of query topics considered as
having MWEs varies according to the dictionary
used. Table 5 shows the number of query topics
containing MWEs for each dictionary used, and as a
consequence, the percentage of modified query top-
ics over the complete set of 310 topics.
First, it is interesting to observe the values of
MAP for all topics that have been altered by the
identification of MWEs. These values are shown in
Table 6.
As shown in Table 6 we verified that the GS in-
dex obtained the best result compared to others. This
106

was somewhat expected since the MWEs in that dic-
tionary are considered ?real? MWEs. After GS, best
results were obtained from the manual indices M1
and M2. The index that we consider as containing
the lowest confident MWEs (WCN), obtained better
results than Decision Trees, Nominal Compounds
and Best Nominal Compounds, in this order. One
possible reason for this to happen is that the number
of MWEs inserted is higher than in the other indices.
Compared with the BL, all indices with MWE inser-
tion have improved more than degraded the results,
in quantitative terms. Our largest gain was with
the index GS, where 55.56% of the topics have im-
proved, but the same index showed the highest per-
centage of loss, 22.22%. Analyzing the WCN, we
can identify that this index has the lowest gain com-
pared to all other indices: 32.14%, although having
also the lowest loss. But, 60.71 % of the topics mod-
ified had no significant differences compared to the
Baseline. Thus, we can conclude that the WCN in-
dex is the one that modifies the least the result of a
query. The indices CN and BCN had a similar result,
and knowing that a dictionary used to create BCN is
a subset of the dictionary CN, we can conclude that
the gain values, choosing the best MWE candidates,
does not affect the accuracy, which only improves
subtly. But the computational cost for the insertion
of these MWEs in the corpus was reduced by half. In
terms of gain percentage, indices M1 and M2 were
superior only to WCN, but they are close to other
results, including the DT index, which obtained an
intermediate result between manual dictionaries and
CN. Analyzing some topics in depth, like topic 141
(Figure 3), the best the result among all the indices
was obtained by the CN.

Figure 3: Topic #141
Table 7 shows the top ten scoring documents re-
trieved for query topic 141 in the baseline. The rele-
vant document (in bold) is the fourth position in the
Baseline. After inserting the expression letter bomb
twice (because it occurs twice in the original topic),
and tv channel that were in dictionary D1 used by the
CN index, the relevant document is scored higher
and as a consequence is returned in the first posi-
tion of the ranking(Table 8) . The MAP of this topic
has increased 75 percentage points, from 0.2500 in
Baseline to 1.000 in the CN index. We see also that
the document that was in first position in the Base-
line ranking, has its score decreased and was ranked
in fourth position in the ranking given by the CN.
This document contained information on a ?small
bomb located outside the of the Russian embassy?
and has is not relevant to topic 141, being properly
relegated to a lower position.
An interesting fact about this topic is that only the
MWE letter bomb influences the result. This was
verified as in the index BCN, whose dictionary does
not have this MWE, the topic was changed only be-
cause of the MWE tv channel and there was no gain
or loss for the result.
The second highest gain was of M1 index, in topic
173. The gain was of 28 percentage points. On the
other hand, we found a downside in M1 and M2
indices, although they improved results on average,
they have reached very high values of loss in some
topics.

In sum, the MWEs insertion seems to improve re-
trieval bringing more relevant documents, due to a
more precise indexing of specific terms. However,
the use of these expressions also brought a negative
impact for some cases, because some topics require
a semantic analysis to return relevant documents (as
for example topic 130, which requires relevant doc-
uments to mention the causes of the death of Kurt
Cobain ? documents which mention his death with-
out mentioning the causes were not considered rele-
vant).
5 Conclusions and Future Work
This work consists in investigating the impact of
Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on
compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems,
and whether a more adequate treatment for these ex-
pressions can bring possible improvements in the in-
dexing these expressions. MWEs are found in all
genres of texts and their appropriate use is being tar-
geted for study, both in linguistics and computing,
due to the different characteristic variations of this
type of expression, which ends up causing problems
for the success of computational methods that aim
their processing.
In this work we aimed at achieving a better under-
standing of several important points associated with
the use of Multiword Expressions in IR systems. In
general, the MWEs insertion improves the results of
retrieval for relevant documents, because the index-
ing of specific terms makes it easier to retrieve spe-
cific documents related to these terms. Nevertheless,
the use of these expressions made the results worse
in some c]ases, because some topics require a se-
mantic analysis to return relevant documents. Some
of these documents are related to the query, but do
not satisfy all criteria in the query topic. We con-
clude also that the quality of MWEs used directly
influenced the results.
For future work, we would like to use other MWE
types and not just compound nouns as used in this
work. Other methods of extraction and a further
study in Named Entities are good themes to comple-
ment this subject. A variation of corpora, different
from newspaper articles, because each domain has a
specific terminology, can also be an interesting sub-
ject for further evaluation.
