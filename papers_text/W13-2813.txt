Abstract 
Since the Tunisian revolution, Tunisian Dialect (TD) 
used in daily life, has became progressively used and 
represented in interviews, news and debate programs 
instead of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This situ-
ation has important negative consequences for natural 
language processing (NLP): since the spoken dialects 
are not officially written and do not have standard 
orthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate cor-
pora to use for training NLP tools. Furthermore, there 
are almost no parallel corpora involving TD and 
MSA. In this paper, we describe the creation of Tuni-
sian dialect text corpus as well as a method for build-
ing a bilingual dictionary, in order to create language 
model for speech recognition system for the Tunisian 
Broadcast News. So, we use explicit knowledge about 
the relation between TD and MSA.  
1 Introduction 
Recently, due to the political changes that 
have occurred in the Arab world, we noticed a 
new remarkable diversity in the media. Arabic 
dialects used in daily life have became progres-
sively used and represented in interviews, news 
and debate programs instead of Modern Standard 
Arabic (MSA). In Tunisia for example, the revo-
lution has affected not only the people but also 
the media. Since that, the media programs have 
been changed:  television channels, political de-
bates and broadcasts news have been multiplied. 
Therefore, this gave birth to a new kind of lan-
guage. Indeed, the majority of speech is no long-
er on MSA but alternating between MSA and 
dialect. Thus, we can distinguish in the same 
speech, MSA words, TD words and MSA-TD 
words such as a word with an MSA component 
(stem) and dialectal affixes.  This situation poses 
significant challenges to NLP, in fact applying 
NLP tools designed for MSA directly to TD 
yields significantly lower performance, making it 
imperative to direct the research to building re-
sources and tools to process this kind of lan-
guage. In our case we aim to convert this new 
language to text, but this process presents a se-
ries of linguistic and computational challenges 
some of these relate to language modeling: stud-
ying large amounts of text to learn about patterns 
of words in a language. This task is complicated 
because of the total lack of TD-MSA resources, 
whether parallel text or paper dictionaries. In this 
paper, we describe a method to create Tunisian 
Dialect (TD) text corpora and the associated lex-
ical resources as well as building bilingual dic-
tionary MSA-TD.  
2 Related work  
Spoken languages which have no written form 
can be classified as limited-resources languages. 
Therefore, several studies has attempted to over-
come the problems of computerization of these 
languages. (Scherrer, 2008) in order to computer-
ize the existing dialect in Switzerland, developed 
a translation system: standard German to any 
variety of the dialect continuum of German-
speaking Switzerland. Moreover, (Shaalan et al 
2007) proposed a system of translation MSA-
Egyptian dialect. For this, they tried to build a 
parallel corpus between Egyptian dialect and 
MSA-based on mapping rules EGY-MSA. Be-
sides dialects, there are several languages from 
the group of limited-resources languages that do 
not have a relation with a well-resourced lan-
guage. Indeed, (Nimaan et al, 2006) presented 
several scenarios to collect corpora in order to 
88
process the Somali language: Collecting corpus 
from the web, automatic synthesis of texts and 
machine translation French-Somali. (SENG, 
2010) selected news sites in Khmer to collect 
data in order to solicit the lack of resources in 
Khmer. 
The literature shows that there is little work that 
dealt with the Tunisian Arabic, the target lan-
guage of this work. (Graja et al 2011), for ex-
ample, treated the Tunisian Dialect for under-
standing speech. To train their system, research-
ers relied on manual transcripts of conversations 
between agents at the train station and travelers. 
However, a limited vocabulary is a problem if 
we want to model a language model for a system 
of recognition of television's programs with a 
wide and varied vocabulary. 
3 Method to create Tunisian Dialect 
Corpora  
In Arabic there are almost no parallel corpora 
involving TD and MSA. Therefore, Machine 
Translation (MT) is not easy, especially when 
there are no MT resources available such as natu-
rally occurring parallel text or transfer lexicon. 
So, to deal with this problem, we proposed to 
leverage the large available annotated MSA re-
sources by exploiting MSA/dialect similarities 
and addressing known differences. Our approach 
consists first on studying the morphological, syn-
tactic and lexical difference by exploiting the 
Penn Arabic Treebank. Second, presenting these 
differences by developing rules and building dia-
lectal concepts. Finally, storing these transfor-
mations into dictionaries.   
3.1 Penn Arabic TreeBank corpora to cre-
ate bilingual lexicon MSA-TD 
Treebanks, are an important resources that al-
lows for important research in general NLP ap-
plications. In the case of Arabic, two important 
treebanking efforts exist: the Penn Arabic Tree-
bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al, 2004; Maamouri 
et al, 2009) and the Prague Arabic Dependency 
Treebank (PADT) (Smr? and Haji, 2007; Smr? et 
al., 2008).  The PATB not only provides tokeni-
zation, complex POS tags, and syntactic struc-
ture; it also provides empty categories, 
diacritizations, lemma choices. The PATB con-
sists of 23,611 parse-annotated sentences (Bies 
and Maamouri, 2003; Maamouri and Bies, 2004) 
from Arabic newswire text in MSA. The PATB 
annotation scheme involves 497 different POS-
tags with morphological information. In this 
work we attempted to mitigate the genre 
differences by transforming the MSA-ATB to 
look like TD-ATB. This will allow us to create in 
tandem a bilingual lexicon with different 
dialectal concept (Figure1). For this, we adopted 
a transformation method based on the parts of 
speech of ATB's word.

resources 
3.2 Modeling verbal lexical entries for the 
bilingual dictionary 
As we aim to adapt MSA tools to TD, we tried to 
build for TD verbs the same concepts as those in 
MSA. Therefore, we focused in this work on the 
study of correspondence that may exist among 
the concepts of MSA verbs and dialect verbs. In 
Arabic there are three principal verbal concepts: 
1-Root: It is the basic source of all forms of Ara-
bic verb. The root is not a real word rather it is a 
sequence of three consonants that can be found 
in all words that are related to it. Most roots are 
composed of three letters, very few are of four or 
five consonants. 
2-Pattern: In MSA, patterns are models with dif-
ferent structures that are applied to the root to 
create a lemma. For example, for the root ? ? ? : 
xrj, we can apply different patterns, which give 
different lemmas with different meanings  
Root1: xrj/ ? ?? / C1C2C3+ verbal pattern1: 
AistaC1oC2a3 =lemma1  ???????????/ to extract  
Root1: xrj/???/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern2 
FoEaL(FaEal)=lemma2   ?????? / to go out . 
Root1: xrj ( ? ?? )/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern3 
>aC1oC2aC3=lemma3  ???????? / to eject 
 2-Lemma: The lemma is a fundamental concept 
in the processing of texts in at least some lan-
guages. Arabic words can be analyzed as consist-
ing of a root inserted into a pattern.   
TD-lemma building: Verbs in the PATB corpus 
are presented in their inflected forms. So, we ex-
tracted lemmas and their roots using the morpho-
logical analyzer developed by Elexir FM (Smrz, 
2007). As we are native speakers of TD, we as-
sociate to each MSA-Lemma a TUN-Lemma. As 
a result, we found that 60% of verbs change to-
tally by passing from MSA to TD. As we have 
1500 TD-Lemmas, and starting from the fact that 
89
MSA verbs have patterns describing their mor-
phological behavior during conjugation, we tried 
to assign, if possible, to each TD-Lemma a TD-
Pattern. 
TD-pattern building: The challenge on building 
TD-pattern was to find patterns similar to those 
in MSA. Thus, by studying the morphology of  
TD-lemmas, we remarked  that it's possible to 
assign to TD-lemmas the same pattern as those 
on MSA but with defining other patterns that will 
be sub-patterns to these patterns. In fact, this 
process has allowed distinguishing 32 patterns 
for dialect verbs while there were 15 in MSA. 
This was due to the morphological richness and 
the frequent change of vowel within TD-lemmas. 
For example: 
In MSA $Arak/yu$Arik/to participate and 
dAfaE/yudAFiE/to defend belongs to the 
patternII: CACaC(perfectiveform)/yiCACiC 
(imperfectiveform). In TD the model of these 
tow verbs remains CACVC/yVCACVC but the 
vowel of the second consonant of the pattern 
(vowel letter ? / E) change. The mark of this 
vowel is a fundamental criterion for classifying a 
verb in MSA (Ouerhani, 2009), that's why we 
proposed to define tow sub-pattern for the pat-
tern II,  by dividing the pattern-II to II-i: 
CACiC/yVCACiC and II-a:CACaC/yVCACaC. 
As consequence, $Arak/yu$Arik/ becomes in TD 
$Arik/yi$Arik/ belongs to CACiC/yVCACiC and 
dAfaE/yudAFiE becomes in TD dAfaE/yidAFaE  
belongs to CACaC/yiVCACaC. 
 Therefore, by adopting this reasoning, we suc-
ceeded with the ATB's verbs to define pattern for 
the TD verb. Thus, knowing these new patterns, 
we will be able to assign a pattern for all TD 
verbs.  
TD-root building: In Tunisian dialect, there is 
no standard definition for the root. For this, con-
struction of root dialect was not obvious, espe-
cially when the root verb changes completely 
through the MSA to the dialect. In fact, to define 
a root for TD verbs, we have adopted a deductive 
method. Indeed, in MSA, the rule says: root + 
pattern= Lemma (1). In our case, we have al-
ready defined the TD-lemma and the TD-pattern. 
Following rule (1), the extraction of the root is 
then made easy. For example, we classified the 
lemma ????? /Aistan ~ aY/Wait in the pattern 
AistaCCaC then root(?) + AistaCCaC= ????? / ~ 
YAistana~ 
Following (1), the root for the verb  ?????  /Aistan 
~ aY/Wait is "???" [NNY]. In fact, we can say that 
the definition of roots is a problematic issue 
which could allow more discussion. According 
to (1), it was like we have forced the roots to be 
[NNY]. However, if we classified Aistann ~ aY 
under the pattern AiCCaCal, the root in this case 
must be snn. The root can also be quadrilateral 
???? / snnY if we classified Aistann~ aY under the 
pattern AiCCaCaC. But as there's no standard, 
we have done in our best to be the most logical 
possible to define dialectal root. 
3.3 Structure of verbal lexicon entries 
Different verbal transformations described above 
are modeled and stored at a dictionary of verb as 
follows: to each MSA verbal block containing 
MSA-lemma, MSA-pattern and MSA-root will 
correspond TD- block which containing TD-
lemma, TD-root and TD-pattern. So, knowing 
the pattern and the root we will able to generate 
automatically various inflected forms of the TUN 
verbs. That?s why we stored in our dictionary the 
active and the passive form of the TD-lemma in 
perfective and imperfective tense. We also store 
the inflected forms in the imperative (CV).  Fig-
ure 2 shows the structure that we have defined 
for the dictionary to present the TD-verbal con-
cepts (in section 4 we will explain how we will 
automate the enrichment of this dictionary).

3.4 Modeling lexical entries for tools words 
in the bilingual dictionary 
Tools words or syntactic tools are an area that 
reflects the specific syntax of the dialect. It has a 
90
large amount in the Treebank and all MSA-texts. 
However, their transformation was not trivial and 
required, for each tool a study of its different 
context. In our approach, we defined two kinds 
of transformations. The first requires the study of 
different context of a tool word. In fact, the same 
word may have different translations depending 
on its context. Thus, to deal with the variation of 
context, we developed mapping rules. Note that 
among these contexts, there are those that cause 
a change in the syntactic order of words by pass-
ing to the dialect. The second transformation is 
direct, the word remains unchanged whatever the 
context. 
3.5 Context dependent transformation 
We mean by transformation-based context, the 
passage MSA-DT which is based on transfor-
mation rules. Indeed given a word W, we say 
that the transformation of W is based on context 
if it gives a new translation whenever it changes 
on context. RT :  X + W + Y = TDk 
X =
?m
j=
POSjWj

:
; Y = ?n

POSiWi

:
; k var-
ies from 1 to z ;                                
RTk: transformation rules n?k ; POS : Part of 
speech ; W :word tool, TDk: Translation n?k 
The transformation of a tool word may depend to 
the words that it precedes (X), or the following 
word (Y), or both. If none of the contexts is pre-
sented, then a default translation will be assigned 
to the word tool. For example, For the tool word  
"???" [hatY]/So that  which have the POS: Prep-
osition, we developed three different  mapping 
rules depending to the context in the ATB corpo-
ra. 
1- ????? / HatY + verb = ??? (TUN-particle) + 
TUN_verb 
2-    ?????/ HatY + NEG_PART = ??? (TUN-
particle)+ TUN_NEG_PART 
                   otherwise 
3- ?????/HatY = ????? /HatY 
In total, we developed 316 rules for the ATB's 
tools words. Figure 3 shows how we present a 
transformation rule in the dictionary. For each 
tool word we have defined a set of contexts, each 
context contains one or more configurations. The 
configuration describes the position and the part 
of speech of the words of context. Each context 
corresponds to a new translation of the tool 
word.

Syntactic transformation:  
The order of the elements in the dialect sentence 
seems to be relatively less important than in oth-
er languages . However, the canonical word or-
der in Tunisian verbal sentences is SVO (Sub-
ject-Verb-Object) (Baccouche , 2004). In con-
trast, MSA word order can have the following 
three forms: SVO / VSO / VOS (2). 
(1) TD:  ???????? ???????  ??????  /AlTfol ktib aldars/the child 
wrote the lesson: SVO 
(2) MSA: ????? ??? ?????/ktib Altfol Ald~ars/wrote 
the boy the lesson: VSO. 
This opposition bestween the MSA and the dia-
lect is clearer in the case of proper names. In 
fact, MSA order is VSO (3) while the order in 
TD is SVO. (Mahfoudhi, 2002) 
(3) MSA: ??????? ???? ??? />akal Alqit Alfi>rAn / 
Cats rats 
(4) TD:  ??????? ??? ???? / Alqit >akal Alfi>rAn /Cats 
eat rats 
There are other types of simple dialect sentences 
named nominal sentences which do not contain a 
verb. They have the same order in both Tunisian 
and MSA. For example: 
MSA: ????? ??? /TaKs HAr/ weather is hot 
TD:  ????????  ??????? / TaKs sxuwn/ weather is hot 
In our work, we discussed the syntactic level at 
some nominal groups. The word order is general-
ly reversed by passing to TD. For example: 
(1)MSA: ADV + ADJ: 
???? />ayDaA/Also+ ??????? /muvaK~af/also educated 
 (2) TD: ADJ +ADV: 
 TD: ADJ/ ??????? +ADV/ ???? 
(2)MSA: Noun + ADJ: 
 ??????? ???? /kutubun kavira/many books 
91
TD: ADJ + Noun: 
???? ????  /bar$A ktub 
In the dictionary, we present this kind of rule as 
shown in the figure 4.

3.6 Context independent transformation  
In addition to the context-dependent 
transformations, the translation of some tools 
words in the corpus was direct "word to word", 
eg; the word remains the same regardless of the 
context. Figure 5 shows an example of how we 
represented this kind of translation in the 
dictionary

4 Automatic generation of Tunisian Di-
alect corpora 
To test and improve the developed bilingual 
models, we tried by exploiting our dictionaries to 
automate the task of converting MSA corpora to 
a corpora with a dialect appearance.  
For this, we developed a tool called Tunisian 
Dialect Translator (TDT) which enables to pro-
duce TD texts and to enrich the MSA-TD dic-
tionary (Figure 6). This tool works according to 
the following steps: 
1-Morphosyntactic annotation of MSA texts: 
TDT annotate each MSA text 
morphosyntactically by using MADA analyzer 
(Morphological Analyser and disambiguisator of 
Arabic) (Habash, 2010). MADA is a toolkit that, 
given a raw MSA text, adds as much lexical and 
morphological information as possible by disam-
biguating in one operation part-of-speech tags, 
lexemes, diacritizations and full morphological 
analyses. 
2-Exploiting MSA-TD Dictionaries: Based on 
each part of speech of the MSA-word, TDT pro-
pose for each MSA structure the corresponding 
TD translation by exploiting the MSA-TD dic-
tionaries.  
3-Enriching lexicon:  As the lexical database 
does not cover all Arabic words, texts resulting 
from the previous step are not totally translated. 
Therefore, in order to improve the quality of 
translation and to enrich our dictionaries to be 
well used even in other NLP application, we 
added to TDT a semi-automatic enrichment 
module. This module filters first all MSA words 
for which a translation has not been provided. 
Then, TDT assigned for them their 
corresponding MSA-lemmas and POS, the user 
proposes, if the POS is verb or noun, a TD-root  
and a TD-pattern (described in subsection 3.2) 
and the TDT proposes automatically the 
appropriate Tunisian lemma and it's inflected 
forms. 
5 Evaluation  
To evaluate different translations of the verbs 
dictionary, we asked 47 judges (native speakers) 
to translate a sample containing 10% of verbs in 
the dictionary. The evaluation consists in com-
paring what we have proposed as a translation of 
lexical items taken from the ATB with the pro-
posals of judges who are native speakers of Tu-
nisian dialect. The percentages calculated reflect 
the percentage of agreement for each verb trans-
lations between judges and the translation pro-
posed in our lexicon. Table 1 shows the obtained 
results.  
       Table 1- Evaluation of verb translation  
For the same context, an MSA-Verb may have 
many translations. The agreement decreases for 
changed verbs because the judges may propose a 
valid translation different from what we have 
proposed in the dictionary. Moreover, as the 
translation of the majority of tool words depends 
on context, we asked 5 judges to translate 89 
sentences containing 133 words tools. In this 
sample, we made some tools words repeated in 
the same sentence but in different context. Table

(2) gives the percentages of agreement between 
the translations of the judges and those of our 
dictionaries of tools words. The variation in 
percentage is due to the fact that for some words, 
judges do not agree among themselves. The table 
also shows the percentage of disagreement 
between judges and dictionaries.

Table 2- Evaluation of   tool word translation 
 
In fact, the disagreement arises when no judge 
gives translation similar to the translation 
proposed in the dictionaries. But, by increasing 
the number of judges, the disagreement 
decreases which proves that our dictionaries are 
able to give acceptable translations by several 
judges 
6 Conclusion 
This paper presented an effort to create resources 
and translation tool for Tunisian dialect. 
To deal with the total lack of written resource in 
Tunisian dialect, we described first a methodolo-
gy that allowed the creation of bilingual diction-
aries with in tandem TD-ATB. In fact, TD-ATB 
will serve as a source of insight on the phenome-
na that need to be addressed and as corpora to 
train TD-NLP tools. We focused second on de-
scribing TDT a tool to generate automatically 
TD corpora and to enrich semi-automatically the 
dictionaries we have built. 
We plan to continue working on improving the 
TD-resources by studying the transformation of 
nouns. We also plan to validate our approach by 
measuring the ability of a language model, built 
on a corpus translated by our TDT tool, to model 
transcriptions of Tunisian broadcast news.  
Experiments in progress showed that the integra-
tion of translated data improves significantly lex-
ical coverage and perplexity of language models.
