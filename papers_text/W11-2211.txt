Abstract
In this paper we apply lightly-supervised
training to a hierarchical phrase-based statis-
tical machine translation system. We employ
bitexts that have been built by automatically
translating large amounts of monolingual data
as additional parallel training corpora. We ex-
plore different ways of using this additional
data to improve our system.
Our results show that integrating a second
translation model with only non-hierarchical
phrases extracted from the automatically gen-
erated bitexts is a reasonable approach. The
translation performance matches the result we
achieve with a joint extraction on all train-
ing bitexts while the system is kept smaller
due to a considerably lower overall number of
phrases.
1 Introduction
We investigate the impact of an employment of large
amounts of unsupervised parallel data as training
data for a statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem. The unsupervised parallel data is created by au-
tomatically translating monolingual source language
corpora. This approach is called lightly-supervised
training in the literature and has been introduced by
Schwenk (2008). In contrast to Schwenk, we do not
apply lightly-supervised training to a conventional
phrase-based system (Och et al, 1999; Koehn et al,
2003) but to a hierarchical phrase-based translation
(HPBT) system.
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang,
2005) a weighted synchronous context-free gram-
mar is induced from parallel text, the search is
based on CYK+ parsing (Chappelier and Rajman,
1998) and typically carried out using the cube prun-
ing algorithm (Huang and Chiang, 2007). In addi-
tion to the contiguous lexical phrases as in standard
phrase-based translation, the hierarchical phrase-
based paradigm also allows for phrases with gaps
which are called hierarchical phrases. A generic
non-terminal symbol serves as a placeholder that
marks the gaps.
In this paper we study several different ways
of incorporating unsupervised training data into
a hierarchical system. The basic techniques we
employ are the use of multiple translation mod-
els and a distinction of the hierarchical and the
non-hierarchical (i.e. lexical) part of the transla-
tion model. We report experimental results on
the large-scale NIST Arabic-English translation task
and show that lightly-supervised training yields sig-
nificant gains over the baseline.
2 Related Work
Large-scale lightly-supervised training for SMT as
we define it in this paper has been first carried out
by Schwenk (2008). Schwenk translates a large
amount of monolingual French data with an initial
Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) baseline system into En-
glish. In Schwenk?s original work, an additional
bilingual dictionary is added to the baseline. With
lightly-supervised training, Schwenk achieves im-
provements of around one BLEU point over the
baseline. In a later work (Schwenk and Senellart,
2009) he applies the same method for translation
model adaptation on an Arabic-French task with
91
gains of up to 3.5 points BLEU. 1
Hierarchical phrase-based translation has been pi-
oneered by David Chiang (Chiang, 2005; Chiang,
2007) with his Hiero system. The hierarchical
paradigm has been implemented and extended by
several groups since, some have published their soft-
ware as open source (Li et al, 2009; Hoang et al,
2009; Vilar et al, 2010).
Combining multiple translation models has been
investigated for domain adaptation by Foster and
Kuhn (2007) and Koehn and Schroeder (2007) be-
fore. Heger et al (2010) exploit the distinction be-
tween hierarchical and lexical phrases in a similar
way as we do. They train phrase translation proba-
bilities with forced alignment using a conventional
phrase-based system (Wuebker et al, 2010) and em-
ploy them for the lexical phrases while the hierarchi-
cal phrases stay untouched.
3 Using the Unsupervised Data
The most straightforward way of trying to improve
the baseline with lightly-supervised training would
be to concatenate the human-generated parallel data
and the unsupervised data and to jointly extract
phrases from the unified parallel data (after having
trained word alignments for the unsupervised bitexts
as well). This method is simple and expected to
be effective usually. There may however be two
drawbacks: First, the reliability and the amount of
parallel sentences may differ between the human-
generated and the unsupervised part of the training
data. It might be desirable to run separate extrac-
tions on the two corpora in order to be able to dis-
tinguish and weight phrases (or rather their scores)
according to their origin during decoding. Second, if
we incorporate large amounts of additional unsuper-
vised data, the amount of phrases that are extracted
may become much larger. We would want to avoid
blowing up our phrase table sizes without an appro-
1Schwenk names the method lightly-supervised training be-
cause the topics that are covered in the monolingual source lan-
guage data that is being translated may potentially also be cov-
ered by parts of the language model training data of the system
which is used to translate them. This can be considered as a
form of light supervision. We loosely apply the term lightly-
supervised training if we mean the process of utilizing a ma-
chine translation system to produce additional bitexts that are
used as training data, but still refer to the automatically pro-
duced bilingual corpora as unsupervised data.

priate effect on translation quality. This holds in par-
ticular in the case of hierarchical phrases. Phrase-
based machine translation systems are usually able
to correctly handle local context dependencies, but
often have problems in producing a fluent sentence
structure across long distances. It is thus an intuitive
supposition that using hierarchical phrases extracted
from unsupervised data in addition to the hierar-
chical phrases extracted from the presumably more
reliable human-generated bitexts does not increase
translation quality. We will compare a joint extrac-
tion to the usage of two separate translation mod-
els (either without separate weighting, with a binary
feature, or as a log-linear mixture). We will further
check if including hierarchical phrases from the un-
supervised data is beneficial or not.
4 Experiments
We use the open source Jane toolkit (Vilar et al,
2010) for our experiments, a hierarchical phrase-
based translation software written in C++.
4.1 Baseline System
The baseline system has been trained using a
human-generated parallel corpus of 2.5M Arabic-
English sentence pairs. Word alignments in both
92
directions were produced with GIZA++ and sym-
metrized according to the refined method that was
suggested by Och and Ney (2003).
The models integrated into our baseline system
are: phrase translation probabilities and lexical
translation probabilities for both translation direc-
tions, length penalties on word and phrase level,
three binary features marking hierarchical phrases,
glue rule, and rules with non-terminals at the bound-
aries, four simple additional count- and length-
based binary features, and a large 4-gram language
model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing that
was trained with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
We ran the cube pruning algorithm, the depth of
the hierarchical recursion was restricted to one by
using shallow rules as proposed by Iglesias et al
(2009).
The scaling factors of the log-linear model com-
bination have been optimized towards BLEU with
MERT (Och, 2003) on the MT06 NIST test corpus.
MT08 was employed as held-out test data. Detailed
statistics for the parallel training data are given in
Table 1, for the development and the test corpus in
Table 2.
4.2 Unsupervised Data
The unsupervised data that we integrate has been
created by automatic translations of parts of the
Arabic LDC Gigaword corpus (mostly from the
HYT collection) with a standard phrase-based sys-
tem (Koehn et al, 2003). We thus in fact conduct a
cross-system and cross-paradigm variant of lightly-
supervised training. Translating the monolingual
Arabic data has been performed by LIUM, Le Mans,
France. We thank Holger Schwenk for kindly pro-
viding the translations.
The score computed by the decoder for each
translation has been normalized with respect to the
sentence length and used to select the most reliable
sentence pairs. Word alignments for the unsuper-
vised data have been produced in the same way as
for the baseline bilingual training data. We report
the statistics of the unsupervised data in Table 3.
4.3 Translation Models
We extracted three different phrase tables, one from
the baseline human-generated parallel data only,
one from the unsupervised data only, and one joint

phrase table from the concatenation of the baseline
data and the unsupervised data. We will denote the
different extractions as baseline, unsupervised, and
joint, respectively.
The conventional restrictions have been applied
for phrase extraction in all conditions, i.e. a maxi-
mum length of ten words on source and target side
for lexical phrases, a length limit of five (including
non-terminal symbols) on source side and ten on tar-
get side for hierarchical phrases, and at most two
non-terminals per rule which are not allowed to be
adjacent on the source side. To limit the number of
hierarchical phrases, a minimum count cutoff of one
and an extraction pruning threshold of 0.1 have been
applied to them. Note that we did not prune lexical
phrases.
Statistics on the phrase table sizes are presented
in Table 4.2 In total the joint extraction results in
almost three times as many phrases as the baseline
extraction. The extraction from the unsupervised
data exclusively results in more than two times as
many hierarchical phrases as from the baseline data.
The sum of the number of hierarchical phrases from
baseline and unsupervised extraction is very close
to the number of hierarchical phrases from the joint
extraction. If we discard the hierarchical phrases ex-
tracted from the unsupervised data and use the lex-
ical part of the unsupervised phrase table (27.3M
phrases) as a second translation model in addition to
the baseline phrase table (67.0M phrases), the over-
all number of phrases is increased by only 41% com-
pared to the baseline system.

4.4 Experimental Results
The empirical evaluation of all our systems on the
two standard metrics BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002)
and TER (Snover et al, 2006) is presented in Ta-
ble 5. We have also checked the results for statistical
significance over the baseline. The confidence in-
tervals have been computed using bootstrapping for
BLEU and Cochran?s approximate ratio variance for
TER (Leusch and Ney, 2009).
When we combine the full baseline phrase ta-
ble with the unsupervised phrase table or the lexi-
cal part of it, we either use common scaling factors
for their source-to-target and target-to-source trans-
lation costs, or we use common scaling factors but
mark entries from the unsupervised table with a bi-
nary feature, or we optimize the four translation fea-
tures separately for each of the two tables as part of
the log-linear model combination.
Including the unsupervised data leads to a sub-
stantial gain on the unseen test set of up to +1.0%
BLEU absolute. The different ways of combining
the manually produced data with the unsupervised
have little impact on translation quality. This holds
specifically for the combination with only the lexical
phrases, which, when marked with a binary feature,
is able to obtain the same results as the full (joint
extraction) system but with much less phrases. We
compared the decoding speed of these two setups
and observed that the system with less phrases is
clearly faster (5.5 vs. 2.6 words per second, mea-
sured on MT08). The memory requirements of the
systems do not differ greatly as we are using a bi-
narized representation of the phrase table with on-
demand loading. All setups consume slightly less
than 16 gigabytes of RAM.

5 Conclusion
We presented several approaches of applying
lightly-supervised training to hierarchical phrase-
based machine translation. Using the additional au-
tomatically produced bitexts we have been able to
obtain considerable gains compared to the baseline
on the large-scale NIST Arabic-to-English transla-
tion task. We showed that a joint phrase extraction
from human-generated and automatically generated
parallel training data is not required to achieve sig-
nificant improvements. The same translation qual-
ity can be achieved by adding a second translation
model with only lexical phrases extracted from the
automatically created bitexts. The overall amount of
phrases can thus be kept much smaller.
