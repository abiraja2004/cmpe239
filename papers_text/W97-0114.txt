Abstract 
This paper proposes a method to identify zero pronouns within a ~\]apansse entence and 
their antecedent equivalents within the corresponding English sentence from aligned sentence 
pairs. The method focuses on the characteristics of Japanese and English, in two languages 
from cHfBerent f~rngles and in which distribution of zero pronouns i  very d.uTerent. In this 
method, the Japanese sentence and English translation within the Japanese and English aligned 
sentence pairs are analyzed. Then, the pairs of Japanese word/phrase and their English equiv- 
alent word/phrase are identified from each aligned sentence pair. Next, zero pronouns within a 
Japanese sentence are identified by using the syntactic and semantic structure of the Japanese 
sentence and their antecedents within the English sentence are identified by using the character- 
istics of anaphoric and deictic expressions in English. This method was implemented using the 
Japanese-to-English machine translation system, ALT-3/E for the analysis of Japanese sentences 
and Brill's tagger for the analysis of the English sentences. According to my evaluation, for 554 
zero p~onouns in a sentence set for the evaluation of 3apanese-to-Engllsh machine translation 
systems, 91.5% of the pairs of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentences and their antecedents in 
the English translations were automatically identified correctly.

1.1 Mot ivat ion  
In natural anguages, elements that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted 
from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978). This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural 
language processing systems. For example, in a machine translation system, the system needs to 
recognize those elements which are not present in the source language, but may become manda- 
tory elements in the target language. In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in 
Japanese; whereas they are normally obligatory in English. Thus, in Japanese-to-Engiish ma~ne 
translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese 
("zero pronouns") for their translation i to Engiish expressions. 
Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker 
et al, 1990; ?oshimoto, 1988; Dousa~a, 1994). V/hen considering the application of these methods 
to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area can not be 1/mired, it 
is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resohtion is low as they only 
use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand 
is so large. 
127 
To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider 
appl/cations for a practical machine translation system with an n~\]imJted translation target area, 
have been proposed (Nakaiwa nd Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakalwa nd Ikehara, 
1996). These methods use categorized semantic and pragznatic constraints such as verbal semantic 
attributes (Nakaiwa et al, 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition 
for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns. 
But, with these methods it is necessary to make resolution rules for zero pronouns by hand. 
To make robust rules, with wide coverage, takes a lot of time and labor. Analysts who make 
these resolution rules must be f~rnl\]iar with the NLP system itself. Furthermore, the types of zero 
pronouns change depending on the types of documents which must be analyzed. So, resolution rules 
must be made depencling on the target domain of the documents. But, it is very difficult to make 
rules for every domain because of the time cons-rni~g labor and the need for expertise. Because 
of these problems, a method to make resolution rules of zero pronouns effectively and efficiently is 
aeeded. 
In order to acquire resolution rules for a NLP system effectively and efficiently, various methods 
have been proposed. One typical method for this purpose is to use a corpus for extracting resolution 
rules by analyzing each sentence hi the corpus. With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution 
rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasukawa, 
1996). But t\]zese methods use monolingual corpora and they find it difficult to extract resolution 
rules of zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese. Furthermore, rules 
can only be made when slrnilar expressions to those containing the zero pronouns are found in the 
corpus. 
It seems that a bilingual corpus consisting of sentence pairs, with an original in one language 
and a translation, is better than a monolingual corpus for the purpose of acquiring resolution 
rules of zero pronouns. This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of Japanese and Engl/sh 
whose language farn~lles are so different and in which the distribution of zero pronouns is also very 
different. This combination is more useful than the bilingual corpora of similar languages. 
The technique for acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dic- 
tionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora needs to include several kinds of sub-techniques; 
identification of aligned sentence pairs which consist of pairs of one language sentence and trans- 
lation equivalents of the sentence (sentence alignment); identification of equivalent words/phrases 
pairs from aligned sentence pairs (word alignment); and extraction of rules such as translation rules, 
grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from identified aligned sentence pairs and equivalent 
word/phrase pairs. 
Several methods have been proposed with regard to aligning sentences (Brown et al, 1991; Gale 
and Church, 1991; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996; Kay and l~osche/sen, 1993), alJs~nlng words (Church, 
1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al, 1993; Wu, 1995; Yamada et al, 1996) and acquiring rules from 
bilingual corpora (Dagan et al, 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tana~, 
1994; Yamada et al, 1995). From the point of view of the extraction of resolution rules of zero 
pronouns, a technique to identify zero pronouns in a sentence in one language and their antecedents 
in a translation from aligned sentence pairs is needed. But there is currently no method to identify 
zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically within bilingual corpora.

1.2 A Method for Ext ract ion  of Reso lu t ion  Rules for Japanese  Zero Pronouns  
This section describes the overall design of a method for automatically extracting resolution rules 
for Japanese zero pronouns from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs. 1 Figure 1 shows 
an overview of the system. As shown in this figure, the aligned sentence pairs, consisting of a 
Japanese sentence and its English translation, are analyzed individually by Japanese and English 
syntactic and semantic parsers. Next, the system identifies the pairs of Japanese word/phrase and 
their English equivalent word/phrase, by comparing these two structures, based on the Japanese 
structure and the English structure which are created by the Japanese and English parsers. Then, 
Japanese zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and translation equivalents of their antecedents 
in the English sentence are identified. By using these results, based on the Japanese structure, 
the resolution rules for Japanese zero pronouns within Japanese sentences are created. In the next 
step, the resolution rules are used for the semantic and pragmatic analysis of the Japanese sentence 
by the Japanese parser within the whole rule extlra~tion system. The same Japanese and English 
aligned sentence pairs are inputted to the system and resolution rules of Japanese zero pronouns 
are again extracted. These processes are repeated until the system c~.~ot extract any more rules 
for Japanese zero pronouns resolution from the aligned sentence pairs. 
In this paper, I describe the core method to identify zero pronouns within a Japanese sentence 
and translation equivalents oftheir antecedents within a corresponding English sentence, shown by 
the shaded area in Figure 1. 
I 2 Appearance of Zero Pronouns and Their Antecedents within 
Japanese and English Aligned Sentence Pairs 
In order to understand the distribution of zero pronouns with antecedents within Japanese and 
English aligned sentence pairs, this section examines which zero pronouns in Japanese must be 
explicitly translated into English and where their antecedents appear in EngJJsh, using a test set 
designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems (Ikehara 
et al, 1994). The test set (3718 sentences) has many examples of zero pronouns with intrasentential 
and deictic references. 2 The sentence set was created to test the coverage of expressions that can 
be translated by Japanese-to-English MT systems based on the varieties of Japanese xpressions 
and the differences between Japanese and English. The sentence set has approximately 500 kinds 
of test items. Each sentence has a manual translation, and almost all of the sentences can be 
translated without contextual information (3704 sentences out of 3718 sentences). A MT system 
can be evaluated by comparing its output to the equivalent manual translation. Each sentence 
is expressed in natural Japanese and the sentence set covers many different expressions. The 
average l ngth of Japanese sentence is 16.39 Japanese characters and the average l ngth of English 
translation is 9.22 words. 
This is an example of a zero pronoun in Japanese whose referent is expressed in the English 
equivalent.

Japanese sentence. 'deictic' means that the antecedent of Japanese zero pronouns is not explicitly expressed within 
the Japanese t xt.

In this expression, the Japanese sentence contains the modal expression ~ i  which indicates 
~oPE. This modal expression causes the default referent of the subject zero pronoun to be the 
"writer" or "speaker" which is translated as "IF' in English. 
The results of the examination of zero pronouns and their referential elements in the test set 
are shown in Table 1. There were a total of 554 zero pronouns in 437 sentences. The location of the 
referential elements can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressed in the same Japanese sentence, 
and those not expressed in the same Japanese sentence. The latter were further classified into 7 
kinds. 
? The zero pronoun is not translated because the passive voice is used. 
? The referent is the wr/ter or speaker, uI'; or a group, "we". 
? The referent is the reader or hearer, ~you'. 
? The referent is human but it is not known who the human is. 
? The zero pronoun should be translated as "it ". 
? The zero pronoun should be translated as "this". 
? The referent is another specific element. 
According to this study of the functional test sentence set, in 150 out of 554 instances (27%) 
the antecedents were expressed within the Japanese sentence and in 404 out of 554 instances (73%) 
the referent was not expressed in the Japanese sentence. Zero pronouns could be left unexpressed 
by converting the translation to the passive voice in 157 instances (28~). The other zero pronouns, 
247 instances (45~), referred to referents that did not appear in the Japanese sentence but did 
appear in the English translation. This result shows that aligned sentence pairs win be effective 
for identifying zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically by determining zero pronouns in 
Japanese and their antecedents in English. 
According to a further examination of the English equivalents of Japanese zero pronouns in the 
sentence set in Table 1, depending on the types of referential elements, the style of the English 
equivalents are different. These characteristics an be summarized in the following: 
. 
. 
Deictic referents in English (247 instances) 
These elements are often translated as personal pronouns uch as uF' or "you" or indefinite 
"one  ~ . 
Anaphoric antecedents in English (150 instances; intrasentential) 
These elements are often translated as personal pronouns, demonstratives, such as uthis', 
definite noun phrases, such as noun phrases with detnite art/des (e.g. ~the company") or 
anaphoric "one". 
English expressions of these two types are preferred candidates for translation equivalents of 
Japanese zero pronouns.

3 A Method for Identification of Zero Pronouns and their An- 
tecedents within Japanese and English Aligned Sentence Pairs 
This section describes a method for automatically identifying zero pronouns within Japanese sen- 
tences, and translation equivalents oftheir antecedents within English translation equivalents. The 
shaded part of Figure 1 shows an overview of the system. The system consists of the following 
three parts; the analysis of the Japanese sentence; the analysis of the Engtish sentence; and the 
identification of Japanese zero pronouns in Japanese sentences and their antecedents in English 
equivalent sentences. The next three subsections describe the details of these three process. 
3.1 Analys is  of Japanese  Sentences  
The Japanese sentences are analyzed using the morphological, syntactic and semantic analyzers of 
Japanese in ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al, 1991). The analysis of the Japanese sentences consists of the 
following steps. 
1) Morphological analysis of Japanese sentences 
In this step, Japanese sentence is segmented into words and each word is tagged with i ts  part 
of speech. 
2) Syntact ic and semantic analysis of Japanese sentences 
In this step, using each word within the Japanese sentence and the tagged information for each 
word, the syntactic and semantic structure of the Japanese sentence is created. Because the 
Japanese syntactic and semantic structure is used for the automatic translation to English 
in ALT-J/E, the Japanese structure contains information about the syntactic position of 
Japanese zero pronouns which must be translated into English and also contains the semantic 
constraints for the Japanese zero pronouns forced by the meaning of the verb within the 
Japanese sentence. For the semantic onstraints, we used our original semantic attribute 
system(Ogura etal., 1993). The semantic attribute system has a semantic oncept hierarchy 
which represents "is-a" relationships and ~has-a" relationships, with some 2,800 attributes 
(12-level tree structure) for common ouns, and some 200 attributes (9-level tree structure) 
for proper nouns. 
For example ~om the Japanese sentence in the aligned sentence pair (1), the following syntactic 
and semantic structure is created. 
132

modal : ta / (HOPB)

I I- N:  no. (,~oox) 
\[- CASE : case-2 
case relation : r~SJECT 
\[- NP : ~1 (Semantic Constraints: HUMAN) 
3.2 Ana lys i s  o f  Eng l i sh  Sentences  
The English sentences are analyzed using Brill's English ta~er  (Bri\]l, 1992) and partially parsed 
using the tamed information for each English word. The analysis of English sentences consists of 
the following steps. 
1) Tagging for each word in the  Engl ish sentence 
Using Brill's English taker ,  each English word in the English sentence is tamed with the 
appropriate part of speech. 
2) Par t ia l  syntact ic  analysis of  the  Engl ish sentence 
In this step, first of all, noun phrases and the predicate pat  within the English sentence 
are identified, using the tagged information for each English word by step 1. The predicate 
part means the consecutive words which consist of verb and modal, tense and aspect. Each 
predicate part is distinguished by its voice. Next, the subject of the predicate part and the 
direct object of the predicate part are determined from noun phrases within the English 
sentence. The subject is simply taken to be the preceding adjacent noun phrase of the 
predicate part and the direct object the next adjacent noun phrase, s 
3) Complet ion  o f  elfipsis with in the  Engl ish sentence 
Ellipses within the English sentence are identified and are completed by using the syntactic 
structure. At present, only ellipsed coordinated subjects are treated. In practice, the following 
rules are used for the identification of ellipsis and completed elements. 
Determinat ion  of  Ellipsls When a predicate part in the English sentence is in 
the active voice and the adjacent preceding element is not a noun phrase but a 
coordinating conjunction, the subject of the predicate part is determined to be 
elllpsed. 
Determinat ion  of  Oml t ted  E lement  When the subject of a predicate part is 
determiued to be ellipsed and the subject of the preceding predicate part for the 
8In this step, it is possible to use an English parser as the syntactic analyzer. But, normally, English parsers 
make many possible syntactic structures which are often incorzect. So, when an English parser is used for the English 
syntactic analysis for this step, the system ust select the best structure from the candidates. Furthermore, asshown 
in the following step, the partial syntactic structures are all that is needed for the identh~cation of antecedents of 
Japanese zero pronouns within the Eng~sh translation. So, to keep the robustness, I only use Brill's Eng~sh ta~er 
and partial syntactic parser. 
133 
ellipsis exists or is ellipsed and their omitted element has already been determined, 
the subject noun phrase is determined as the omitted ement for the ellipsis. 
4) Anaphora  resolut ion of  anaphoric expressions wi th in  the  English sentence 
The anaphora resolution of anaphoric expression such as pronouns and definite noun phrases, 
is conducted using the partial syntactic structure of the English sentence. According to 
this step, even if the antecedents of zero pronouns in Japanese are anaphoric expressions 
such as pronouns and definite noun phrases, the anaphora resolution process determines 
the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and the overall system can determine 
the intersentential nd intrssentential resolution rules of Japanese zero pronouns by using 
identified pairs of the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and their Japanese 
equivalents. 4 
For example from the English sentence in aligned sentence pair (1), the following partial syntactic 
? structure is created.

3.3 Ident i f i ca t ion  of  Japanese  Zero P ronouns  and  The i r  Antecedents  
The method to identify Japanese zero pronouns and their English equivalents consists of the follow- 
ing steps. The input of this process is the pair of the syntactic and semantic structure of Japanese 
sentence and the partial syntactic structure of English translation equivalents. 
1) Ident i f icat ion of  the  pairs of  Japanese word /phrase  and their  Engl ish equivalent 
word /phrase .  
I align the Japanese and English elements as described in Y~.raada et al (1996) using the 
following information: 
? bilingual dictionary for Japanese to English MT system, ALT-J/E 
This dictionary is used for the determination of pairs of equivalent word phrases of 
Japanese and English. 
? English dictionary for English generation i ALT-J/E 
This dictionary is used when the SUiFLX differs: for example the derivative, 'ing', between 
the English word in the bilingual dictionary entry and the English word in the English 
sentence within the aligned sentence pair. 
6This step has not  been implemented because anaphora  resolution of  Engl ish sentences needs deta i led syntact ic  
and semantic structure to achieve high accuracy. So, for now, I do not realize the anaphorz esolution process in the 
whole system for the primary examination. 
134 
We remove function words such as prepositions, determiners and others from the target 
English sentence to find Japanese quivalent words/phrases in Japanese. This is because 
function words often must be changed epending on the types of head such as verb for 
preposition and noun for determ/ner in English. 
As a result of this step, the alignment information of aligned words/phrases pairs are tagged 
for the Japanese and English structure. Furthermore, semantic nformation which was tagged 
in a Japanese word/phrase are also ta~ed for the English word/phrase which is aligned with 
the Japanese word/phrase. 
2) Identif ication of  the candidates for antecedents  of Japanese zero pronouns  within 
the  Engl ish sentence: 
In this step, the following English words/phrases are identified within the English sentence 
as possible translation equivalents: 
? personal pronouns uch as "I" or "you" 
? Uone". 
? demonstratives such as x/t" or "that" 
? definite noun phrases uch as a noun phrase with a definite article (e.g. "the company") 
3) A l ignment  of zero pronouns in Japanese sentences and translat ion equivalents of  
their  referents in English sentences: 
The pairs of Japanese words/phrases and English equi~alent words/phrases and the pairs 
of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and their antecedents in the English sentence 
are determ/ned from: the candidates for the pairs of Japanese word/phrases and their En- 
glish equivalent word/phrases which were identi~ed at step 1; and the candidates for the 
antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns within the English sentence which were identified at 
step 2. This determination is conducted based on how stron~y related the candidates are 
and how many pairs can be identified from them. The rules for the determination f the pairs 
of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and their antecedents in the English sentence are 
summarized as follows. The rules are extracted by hand based on the exarnlnation of the test 
set in Section 2. s 
When applying the following rules for each zero pronoun, even if the rule is matched and 
the poss/ble antecedent of the zero pronoun is determined, if the candidate does not satisfy 
the semantic onstraints for the zero pronoun, the rule is not applied and the candidate is
not determined as the antecedent of the zero pronoun. The rules are applied hi the following 
order. If one rule is satisfied for each zero pronoun, the process of the following other rules 
application stops, except for rule 9. 
For each sentence: 
Ru le  1 If a Japanese verb and an English verb are aligned 
and if the subject equivalent s of the Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if the subject of the English verb does not have a Japanese quivalent, 
SAt the extraction process, I tried to make rules which can be identified fully automatically by using relatively 
simple Japanese and English syntactical information. I also take into account the coverage of each rules which can 
be covered as wide as possible. 
e'the subject equivalent' means ga case (subject) or the case which will be translated as a subject in English by 
the MT system. 
135 
: .  ? 
--* the subject of the English verb is determined to be the translation equivalent of the 
antecedent of the Japanese zero pronoun. 
Ru le  2 If a Japanese verb and an English verb are allgned 
and if the subject equivalent of the Japanese verb is a zero pronoun 
and if the zero pronoun and the subject of the English verb are aligned 
and if the object equivalent ~ of the Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if the direct object of the English verb is identified as a antecedent candidate 
and if the direct object of the English verb does not have a Japanese quivalent, 
--, the direct object is determined as the translation equivalent of the antecedent of the 
Japanese zero pronoun. 
Ru le  S If a Japanese verb and an English noun, derived from a verb, which is modified by a 
possessive pronoun, are aligned 
and if a case of the Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if the Japanese quivalent of the possessive pronoun can not be determined, 
the possessive pronoun is determined as the translation equivalent of the antecedent 
of the Japanese zero pronoun. 
Ru le  4 If the subject equivalent of a :Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if the object equivalent of the Japanese verb is aligned with a case in the English 
sentence at subject position 
and if the predicate part of the subject in the English sentence is in the passive voice, 
--. there is no antecedent of the zero pronoun in the subject equivalent position within 
the English sentence because the passive voice expression is used and the zero pronoun 
is marked as unalignable. 
Ru le  5 If the subject equivalent of a Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and the object equivalent of the Japanese verb is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if an English verb is in the passive voice 
and if the subject of the English verb is identified as a candidate antecedent, 
--~ there is no antecedent of the zero pronoun in the subject equivalent position within 
the English sentence and the zero pronoun is marked as unaUgnable 
and the antecedent of the zero pronoun in the object equivalent position is determined 
as the direct object of the English verb because the passive voice expression is used. 
Rule  6 If the subject equivalent of a Japanese unit sentence in the Japanese sentence is an un- 
aligned zero pronoun 
and if the object equivalent of the Japanese unit sentence is an unaligned zero pronoun 
and if the Japanese quivalents of a subject and a direct object within an English unit 
sentence in the English sentence can not be determined in the Japanese sentence or the 
Japanese unit sentence, 
the translation equivalent of the antecedent of the zero pronoun in the subject equiv- 
alent position is determined as the subject of the English unit sentence 
and the translation equivalent of antecedent of the zero pronoun in the object equivalent 
position is determined as the direct object of the English unit sentence. 
Ru le  7 If there is only one unaligned zero pronoun in the Japanese sentence 
and if there is only one unaligned candidate antecedent in the English sentence, 
T'the object equivalent' means the wo case  (crlzect object) oz the case which will be tl~nslated as a direct object 
in English by the MT system. 
136 
--* the translation equivalent of the antecedent ofthe zero pronoun is determined as the 
candidate antecedent. 
Or if there are more than one unaligned possible antecedents, 
--. the translation equivalent of the antecedent of the zero pronoun is determined based 
on the following priority. 
personal pronouns > Uone" > demonstratives > de~uite noun phrases 
Rule  8 If there is an unaligned zero pnonoun and all antecedent candidates have been aligned 
then, if there are one or more candidates which are aligned with Japanese lements in a 
different unit sentence to the unaligned zero pronoun, 
--* the translation equivalent of the antecedent of the zero pronoun is determined from 
those candidates based on the priority in rule 7. 
Rule 9 If the translation equivalent of an antecedent of a zero pronoun which is determined by 
rules 1 - 8, also has another Japanese quivalent within the Japanese sentence, 
the zero pronoun is deterrnlued to be a zero pronoun with an intrasentential n- 
tecedent. 
Rule 10 If there are any remaining unaligned zero pronouns, 
--. these zero pronouns are ones whose antecedents are not explicitly translated in the 
English sentence and are marked as unalignable. 
For example from the zero pronoun in the ga case (subject) in Japanese sentence in aligned sentence 
pair (1), rule 1 is applied and its antecedent is determined as the subject in the English sentence,

4.1 Eva luat ion  Method 
The method to identify zero pronouns and their antecedents within Japanese and English aligned 
sentence pairs which was discussed in Section 3 was evaluated by automatically identifying zero 
pronouns and their antecedents from the functional test sentence set which is already aligned 
sentence by sentence. The conditions for the evaluation were as follows: 
4.1.1 Eva luat ion of  Target  Sentence Pa i rs  
The evaluation used Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs which contain zero pronouns (554 
instances; 437 sentences) in a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English 
machine translation systems (Ikehara et al, 1994) (3718 sentence pairs). 
4.1.2 Analysis of  Japanese and Engl ish sentence 
For the sentence pairs which contain zero pronouns, the syntactic and semantic structure of each 
Japanese sentence was created using the Japanese-to-English MT system, ALT-J/E as the Japanese 
analyzer, described in section 3.1, and the partial syntactic structure of each English sentence was 
created using Brill's tagger as the English analyzer, described in section 3.2. To avoid any effects 
caused by problems at the analysis step on the evaluation of the rules to identify antecedents 
of zero pronouns, described in section 3.3, any incorrect structures in the Japanese and English 
sentences were modified by hand for the evaluation. Furthermore, to take into account he effect 
137 
of the anaphora resolution of anaphoric expression in English sentences on the accuracy of the 
identification of the antecedents of zero pronouns, the antecedents of anaphoric expression i  the 
English sentences were determined by hand and the accuracy with and without anaphora resolution 
was compared. 
4.1.3 Antecedents  
For the sentence pairs which contain zero pronouns, antecedents of each zero pronoun within the 
text set were automatically identified (Section 3). 
4.1.4 Evaluat ion Parameters  
To ex~m~e the effectiveness of automatically identifying antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns 
within English translations, the accuracy of the identified antecedents of each zero pronoun of the 
following three types were examined. 
? Zero pronouns with intrasentential antecedents (150 instances) 
? Zero pronouns with deictic referents which are not expressed in English translation by using 
passive voice expressions (157 instances) 
? Zero pronouns with delctic referents which are expressed inEnglish translation (247 instances) 
4.1.5 Successful ly Identif ied Antecedents  of  Zero Pronouns 
When rules in Section 3.3 correctly identify the accurate antecedent of a Japanese zero pronoun, 
with intrasentential antecedents or with deictic referent, which are expressed in the English trans- 
lation, or when rules in Section 3.3 correctly identify a Japanese zero pronoun as unalignable, that 
is there is no deictic referents expressed in the English translation, the antecedents of zero pronoun 
are judged to be identified successfully. 
4.2 Ident i f i ca t ion  Accuracy  
The accuracy of identified antecedents of zero pronouns is shown in Table 2. As shown in this 
table, the accuracy of identified antecedents for three types of zero pronouns using rules described 
in Section 3.3 is as high as 91.5% in the test using an English analyzer with anaphora resolution 
and 87.2% even in the test using an English analyzer without anaphora resolution. In particular, 
the identification of unatignable for zero pronouns with deictic referents which are not expressed 
in English translation is 100~ accurate in both tests. Furthermore, according to these results, the 
anaphora resolution in English only affects the accuracy of antecedent identification for the zero pro- 
nouns with intrasentential antecedents (89.3% with anaphora resolution, 73.3% without anaphora 
resolution). This result shows that even without using anaphora resolution at English analysis, this 
method achieves relatively high accuracy for zero pronouns with intrasententiai antecedents. 
The result of the detailed exam~ration of the zero pronouns whose antecedents can not be 
identified correctly using this method (47 instances) are summarized in Table 3. The most common 
cause of error is that the Japanese sentence was translated freely and there is no corresponding 
antecedent within the English translation (42 out of 47 instances). For these sentence pairs, the 
antecedents of the zero pronouns are not explicitly expressed in the human translation, but the 
Japanese analyzer still needs the resolution of the zero pronouns because the machine translation 
system which contains the Japanese analyzer can not translate freely like the human translator.

So, this problem is caused by the methodological limitation of proposed method. The remaining 
5 instances are caused by zero pronouns with intrasentential antecedents. In 4 out of 5 cases the 
antecedents of the zero pronouns were not explicitly translated in English by using the passive 
voice but humans can easily understand that the antecedents of the zero pronouns are in the same 
Sentence. This problem is also caused by the limitations of proposed method. The remaining case 
is caused by the fact that the verb of the zero pronoun and the verb of their antecedents could 
not be aligned. This is not a \]imitation of proposed method but a \]imitation of the alignment 
algorithm. These results shows that, for the test set, 508 out of 554 zero pronouns can have their 
antecedents identified using proposed method methodologically, and ~\]most all of the antecedents 
of zero pronouns which can be identified from the Japanese and English alig)aed sentence pairs are 
correctly identified by using proposed method (99.8% ; 507 out of 508 instances).

According to these results, the proposed method is effective for the automatic identification of 
Japanese zero pronouns and their antecedents from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs and 
by using a large amount of aligned sentence pairs it is possible to identify antecedents of Japanese 
zero pronouns for almost all types of Japanese zero pronouns. 
5 Conc lus ion  
This paper proposes a powerful method for the automatic identification of Japanese zero pro- 
nouns and their antecedents from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs. In this paper, only 
Japanese and EngLish language pairs have been discussed. But this method can be applied to var- 
ious kinds of language pairs such as Italian and English, and the effectiveness of the identification 
depends on how different the two languages are. In the future, the effectiveness of proposed method 
for aligned sentence pairs with zero pronouns with intersentential antecedents and for very large 
corpora of aligned sentence pairs will be ex~mlned. The effectiveness of the use of English parsers 
for the English analysis will also be considered. Methods for extracting the most effective rules for 
resolving Japanese zero pronouns from aligned sentence pairs will also be studied. Furthermore, I 
would like to link more powerful and more robust word alignment techniques, which can align for 
unknown words in noisy texts, to the proposed method and also would like to link the proposed 
method with sentence alignment techniques.
