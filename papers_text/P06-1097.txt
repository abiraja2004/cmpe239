Abstract
We introduce a semi-supervised approach
to training for statistical machine transla-
tion that alternates the traditional Expecta-
tion Maximization step that is applied on a
large training corpus with a discriminative
step aimed at increasing word-alignment
quality on a small, manually word-aligned
sub-corpus. We show that our algorithm
leads not only to improved alignments
but also to machine translation outputs of
higher quality.
1 Introduction
The most widely applied training procedure for
statistical machine translation ? IBM model 4
(Brown et al, 1993) unsupervised training fol-
lowed by post-processing with symmetrization
heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003) ? yields low
quality word alignments. When compared with
gold standard parallel data which was manually
aligned using a high-recall/precision methodology
(Melamed, 1998), the word-level alignments pro-
duced automatically have an F-measure accuracy
of 64.6 and 76.4% (see Section 2 for details).
In this paper, we improve word alignment and,
subsequently, MT accuracy by developing a range
of increasingly sophisticated methods:
1. We first recast the problem of estimating the
IBM models (Brown et al, 1993) in a dis-
criminative framework, which leads to an ini-
tial increase in word-alignment accuracy.
2. We extend the IBM models with new
(sub)models, which leads to additional in-
creases in word-alignment accuracy. In the
process, we also show that these improve-
ments are explained not only by the power
of the new models, but also by a novel search
procedure for the alignment of highest prob-
ability.
3. Finally, we propose a training procedure that
interleaves discriminative training with max-
imum likelihood training.
These steps lead to word alignments of higher
accuracy which, in our case, correlate with higher
MT accuracy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we review the data sets we use to
validate experimentally our algorithms and the as-
sociated baselines. In Section 3, we present itera-
tively our contributions that eventually lead to ab-
solute increases in alignment quality of 4.8% for
French/English and 4.8% for Arabic/English, as
measured using F-measure for large word align-
ment tasks. These contributions pertain to the
casting of the training procedure in the discrim-
inative framework (Section 3.1); the IBM model
extensions and modified search procedure for the
Viterbi alignments (Section 3.2); and the in-
terleaved, minimum error/maximum likelihood,
training algorithm (Section 4). In Section 5, we as-
sess the impact that our improved alignments have
on MT quality. We conclude with a comparison of
our work with previous research on discriminative
training for word alignment and a short discussion
of semi-supervised learning.
2 Data Sets and Baseline
We conduct experiments on alignment and
translation tasks using Arabic/English and
French/English data sets (see Table 1 for details).
Both sets have training data and two gold stan-
dard word alignments for small samples of the
training data, which we use as the alignment

Table 2: Baseline Results. F-measures are presented on both the alignment discriminative training set
and the alignment test set sub-corpora, separated by /.
discriminative training set and alignment test set.
Translation quality is evaluated by translating
a held-out translation test set. An additional
translation set called the Maximum BLEU set is
employed by the SMT system to train the weights
associated with the components of its log-linear
model (Och, 2003).
The training corpora are publicly avail-
able: both the Arabic/English data and the
French/English Hansards were released by
LDC. We created the manual word alignments
ourselves, following the Blinker guidelines
(Melamed, 1998).
To train our baseline systems we follow a stan-
dard procedure. The models were trained two
times, first using French or Arabic as the source
language and then using English as the source
language. For each training direction, we run
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), specifying 5 iter-
ations of Model 1, 4 iterations of the HMM model
(Vogel et al, 1996), and 4 iterations of Model 4.
We quantify the quality of the resulting hypothe-
sized alignments with F-measure using the manu-
ally aligned sets.
We present the results for three different con-
ditions in Table 2. For the ?F to E? direction the
models assign non-zero probability to alignments
consisting of links from one Foreign word to zero
or more English words, while for ?E to F? the
models assign non-zero probability to alignments
consisting of links from one English word to zero
or more Foreign words. It is standard practice to
improve the final alignments by combining the ?F
to E? and ?E to F? directions using symmetriza-
tion heuristics. We use the ?union?, ?refined? and
?intersection? heuristics defined in (Och and Ney,
2003) which are used in conjunction with IBM
Model 4 as the baseline in virtually all recent work
on word alignment. In Table 2, we report the best
symmetrized results.
The low F-measure scores of the baselines mo-
tivate our work.
3 Improving Word Alignments
3.1 Discriminative Reranking of the IBM
Models
We reinterpret the five groups of parameters of
Model 4 listed in the first five lines of Table 3 as
sub-models of a log-linear model (see Equation 1).
Each sub-model hm has an associated weight ?m.
Given a vector of these weights ?, the alignment
search problem, i.e. the search to return the best
alignment a? of the sentences e and f according to
the model, is specified by Equation 2.
p?(f, a|e) =
exp(?i ?ihi(a, e, f))

Table 3: Sub-Models. Note that sub-models 1 to 5 are IBM Model 4, sub-models 6 to 16 are new.
Log-linear models are often trained to maxi-
mize entropy, but we will train our model di-
rectly on the final performance criterion. We use
1?F-measure as our error function, comparing hy-
pothesized word alignments for the discriminative
training set with the gold standard.
Och (2003) has described an efficient exact
one-dimensional error minimization technique for
a similar search problem in machine translation.
The technique involves calculating a piecewise
constant function fm(x) which evaluates the er-
ror of the hypotheses which would be picked by
equation 2 from a set of hypotheses if we hold all
weights constant, except for the weight ?m (which
is set to x).
The discriminative reranking algorithm is ini-
tialized with the parameters of the sub-models ?,
an initial choice of the ? vector, gold standard
word alignments (labels) for the alignment dis-
criminative training set, the constant N specifying
the N-best list size used1, and an empty master set
of hypothesized alignments. The algorithm is a
three step loop:
1. Enrich the master set of hypothesized align-
ments by producing an N-best list using ?.
If all of the hypotheses in the N-best list are
already in the master set, the algorithm has
converged, so terminate the loop.
2. Consider the current ? vector and 999 addi-
tional randomly generated vectors, setting ?
to the vector with lowest error on the master
set.
3. Repeatedly run Och?s one-dimensional error
minimization step until there is no further er-
ror reduction (this results in a new vector ?).

3.2 Improvements to the Model and Search
3.2.1 New Sources of Knowledge
We define new sub-models to model factors not
captured by Model 4. These are lines 6 to 16
of Table 3, where we use the ?E to F? align-
ment direction as an example. We use word-level
translation tables informed by both the ?E to F?
and the ?F to E? translation directions derived us-
ing the three symmetrization heuristics, the ?E to
F? translation table from the final iteration of the
HMM model and an ?E to F? translation table de-
rived using approximative stemming. The approx-
imative stemming sub-model (sub-model 9) uses
the first 4 letters of each vocabulary item as the
stem for English and French while for Arabic we
use the full word as the stem. We also use sub-
models for backed off fertility, and direct penal-
ization of unaligned English words (?zero fertil-
ity?) and aligned English words, and unaligned
Foreign words (?NULL-generated? words) and
aligned Foreign words. This is a small sampling
of the kinds of knowledge sources we can use in
this framework; many others have been proposed
in the literature.
Table 4 shows an evaluation of discriminative
reranking. We observe:
1. The first line is the starting point, which is
the Viterbi alignment of the 4th iteration of
HMM training.
2. The 1-to-many alignments generated by dis-
criminatively reranking Model 4 are better
than the 1-to-many alignments of four itera-
tions of Model 4.
3. The 1-to-many alignments of the discrimina-
tively reranked extended model are much bet-
ter than four iterations of Model 4.

ment discriminative training set and the alignment test set sub-corpora, separated by /.
4. The discriminatively reranked extended
model outperforms four iterations of Model
4 in both cases with the best heuristic
symmetrization, but some of the gain is
lost as we are optimizing the F-measure of
the 1-to-many alignments rather than the
F-measure of the many-to-many alignments
directly.
Overall, the results show our approach is better
than or competitive with running four iterations of
unsupervised Model 4 training.
3.2.2 New Alignment Search Algorithm
Brown et al (1993) introduced operations defin-
ing a hillclimbing search appropriate for Model 4.
Their search starts with a complete hypothesis and
exhaustively applies two operations to it, selecting
the best improved hypothesis it can find (or termi-
nating if no improved hypothesis is found). This
search makes many search errors2. We developed
a new alignment algorithm to reduce search errors:
? We perform an initial hillclimbing search (as
in the baseline algorithm) but construct a pri-
ority queue of possible other candidate align-
ments to consider.
? Alignments which are expanded are marked
so that they will not be returned to at a future
point in the search.
? The alignment search operates by consider-
ing complete hypotheses so it is an ?anytime?
algorithm (meaning that it always has a cur-
rent best guess). Timers can therefore be
used to terminate the processing of the pri-
ority queue of candidate alignments.
The first two improvements are related to the
well-known Tabu local search algorithm (Glover,
2A search error in a word aligner is a failure to find the
best alignment according to the model, i.e. in our case a fail-
ure to maximize Equation 2.
1986). The third improvement is important for
restricting total time used when producing align-
ments for large training corpora.
We performed two experiments. The first evalu-
ates the number of search errors. For each corpus
we sampled 1000 sentence pairs randomly, with
no sentence length restriction. Model 4 parameters
are estimated from the final HMM Viterbi align-
ment of these sentence pairs. We then search to
try to find the Model 4 Viterbi alignment with both
the new and old algorithms, allowing them both
to process for the same amount of time. The per-
centage of known search errors is the percentage
of sentences from our sample in which we were
able to find a more probable candidate by apply-
ing our new algorithm using 24 hours of compu-
tation for just the 1000 sample sentences. Table
5 presents the results, showing that our new algo-
rithm reduced search errors in all cases, but fur-
ther reduction could be obtained. The second ex-
periment shows the impact of the new search on
discriminative reranking of Model 4 (see Table 6).
Reduced search errors lead to a better fit of the dis-
criminative training corpus.
4 Semi-Supervised Training for Word
Alignments
Intuitively, in approximate EM training for Model
4 (Brown et al, 1993), the E-step corresponds to
calculating the probability of all alignments ac-
cording to the current model estimate, while the
M-step is the creation of a new model estimate
given a probability distribution over alignments
(calculated in the E-step).
In the E-step ideally all possible alignments
should be enumerated and labeled with p(a|e, f),
but this is intractable. For the M-step, we would
like to count over all possible alignments for each
sentence pair, weighted by their probability ac-
cording to the model estimated at the previous

step. Because this is not tractable, we make the
assumption that the single assumed Viterbi align-
ment can be used to update our estimate in the M-
step. This approximation is called Viterbi training.
Neal and Hinton (1998) analyze approximate EM
training and motivate this type of variant.
We extend approximate EM training to perform
a new type of training which we call Minimum Er-
ror / Maximum Likelihood Training. The intuition
behind this approach to semi-supervised training
is that we wish to obtain the advantages of both
discriminative training (error minimization) and
approximate EM (which allows us to estimate a
large numbers of parameters even though we have
very few gold standard word alignments). We in-
troduce the EMD algorithm, in which discrimina-
tive training is used to control the contributions
of sub-models (thereby minimizing error), while a
procedure similar to one step of approximate EM
is used to estimate the large number of sub-model
parameters.
A brief sketch of the EMD algorithm applied
to our extended model is presented in Figure 1.
Parameters have a superscript t representing their
value at iteration t. We initialize the algorithm
with the gold standard word alignments (labels) of
the word alignment discriminative training set, an
initial ?, N, and the starting alignments (the iter-
ation 4 HMM Viterbi alignment). In line 2, we
make iteration 0 estimates of the 5 sub-models of
Model 4 and the 6 heuristic sub-models which are
iteration dependent. In line 3, we run discrimi-
native training using the algorithm from Section
3.1. In line 4, we measure the error of the result-
ing ? vector. In the main loop in line 7 we align
the full training set (similar to the E-step of EM),
while in line 8 we estimate the iteration-dependent
sub-models (similar to the M-step of EM). Then

new hypothesized alignments of the training cor-
pus.
Table 7 evaluates the EMD semi-supervised
training algorithm. We observe:
1. In both cases there is improved F-measure
on the second iteration of semi-supervised
training, indicating that the EMD algorithm
performs better than one step discriminative
reranking.
2. The French/English data set has converged3
after the second iteration.
3. The Arabic/English data set converged after
improvement for the first, second and third
iterations.
We also performed an additional experiment for
French/English aimed at understanding the poten-
tial contribution of the word aligned data without

alignment discriminative training set does not improve.

the new algorithm4. Like Ittycheriah and Roukos
(2005), we converted the alignment discrimina-
tive training corpus links into a special corpus
consisting of parallel sentences where each sen-
tence consists only of a single word involved in
the link. We found that the information in the
links was ?washed out? by the rest of the data and
resulted in no change in the alignment test set?s
F-Measure. Callison-Burch et al (2004) showed
in their work on combining alignments of lower
and higher quality that the alignments of higher
quality should be given a much higher weight than
the lower quality alignments. Using this insight,
we found that adding 10,000 copies of the special
corpus to our training data resulted in the highest
alignment test set gain, which was a small gain
of 0.6 F-Measure. This result suggests that while
the link information is useful for improving F-
Measure, our improved methods for training are
producing much larger improvements.
5 Improvement of MT Quality
The symmetrized alignments from the last iter-
ation of EMD were used to build phrasal SMT
systems, as were the symmetrized Model 4 align-
ments (the baseline). Aside from the final align-
ment, all other resources were held constant be-
tween the baseline and contrastive SMT systems,
including those based on lower level alignments
models such as IBM Model 1. For all of our ex-
periments, we use two language models, one built
using the English portion of the training data and
the other built using additional English news data.
We run Maximum BLEU (Och, 2003) for 25 iter-
ations individually for each system.
Table 8 shows our results. We report BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2001) multiplied by 100. We also
show the F-measure after heuristic symmetrization
of the alignment test sets. The table shows that
4We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for sug-
gesting that this experiment would be useful even when using
a small discriminative training corpus.
our algorithm produces heuristically symmetrized
final alignments of improved F-measure. Us-
ing these alignments in our phrasal SMT system,
we produced a statistically significant BLEU im-
provement (at a 95% confidence interval a gain of
0.78 is necessary) on the French/English task and
a statistically significant BLEU improvement on
the Arabic/English task (at a 95% confidence in-
terval a gain of 1.2 is necessary).
5.1 Error Criterion
The error criterion we used for all experiments
is 1 ? F-measure. The formula for F-measure is
shown in Equation 3. (Fraser and Marcu, 2006) es-
tablished that tuning the trade-off between Preci-
sion and Recall in the F-Measure formula will lead
to the best BLEU results. We tuned ? by build-
ing a collection of alignments using our baseline
system, measuring Precision and Recall against
the alignment discriminative training set, build-
ing SMT systems and measuring resulting BLEU
scores, and then searching for an appropriate ?
setting. We searched ? = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9 and set
? so that the resulting F-measure tracks BLEU to
the best extent possible. The best settings were
? = 0.2 for Arabic/English and ? = 0.7 for
French/English, and these settings of ? were used
for every result reported in this paper. See (Fraser
and Marcu, 2006) for further details.

6 Previous Research
Previous work on discriminative training for word-
alignment differed most strongly from our ap-
proach in that it generally views word-alignment
as a supervised task. Examples of this perspective
include (Liu et al, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos,
2005; Moore, 2005; Taskar et al, 2005). All
of these also used knowledge from one of the
IBM Models in order to obtain competitive results

with the baseline (with the exception of (Moore,
2005)). We interleave discriminative training with
EM and are therefore performing semi-supervised
training. We show that semi-supervised training
leads to better word alignments than running unsu-
pervised training followed by discriminative train-
ing.
Another important difference with previous
work is that we are concerned with generating
many-to-many word alignments. Cherry and Lin
(2003) and Taskar et al (2005) compared their re-
sults with Model 4 using ?intersection? by look-
ing at AER (with the ?Sure? versus ?Possible? link
distinction), and restricted themselves to consider-
ing 1-to-1 alignments. However, ?union? and ?re-
fined? alignments, which are many-to-many, are
what are used to build competitive phrasal SMT
systems, because ?intersection? performs poorly,
despite having been shown to have the best AER
scores for the French/English corpus we are using
(Och and Ney, 2003). (Fraser and Marcu, 2006)
recently found serious problems with AER both
empirically and analytically, which explains why
optimizing AER frequently results in poor ma-
chine translation performance.
Finally, we show better MT results by using F-
measure with a tuned ? value. The only previous
discriminative approach which has been shown to
produce translations of similar or better quality to
those produced by the symmetrized baseline was
(Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005). They had access
to 5000 gold standard word alignments, consider-
ably more than the 100 or 110 gold standard word
alignments used here. They also invested signif-
icant effort in sub-model engineering (producing
both sub-models specific to Arabic/English align-
ment and sub-models which would be useful for
other language pairs), while we use sub-models
which are simple extensions of Model 4 and lan-
guage independent.
The problem of semi-supervised learning is of-
ten defined as ?using unlabeled data to help su-
pervised learning? (Seeger, 2000). Most work on
semi-supervised learning uses underlying distribu-
tions with a relatively small number of parame-
ters. An initial model is estimated in a supervised
fashion using the labeled data, and this supervised
model is used to attach labels (or a probability dis-
tribution over labels) to the unlabeled data, then a
new supervised model is estimated, and this is it-
erated. If these techniques are applied when there
are a small number of labels in relation to the num-
ber of parameters used, they will suffer from the
?overconfident pseudo-labeling problem? (Seeger,
2000), where the initial labels of poor quality as-
signed to the unlabeled data will dominate the
model estimated in the M-step. However, there
are tasks with large numbers of parameters where
there are sufficient labels. Nigam et al (2000) ad-
dressed a text classification task. They estimate
a Naive Bayes classifier over the labeled data and
use it to provide initial MAP estimates for unla-
beled documents, followed by EM to further re-
fine the model. Callison-Burch et al (2004) exam-
ined the issue of semi-supervised training for word
alignment, but under a scenario where they simu-
lated sufficient gold standard word alignments to
follow an approach similar to Nigam et al (2000).
We do not have enough labels for this approach.
We are aware of two approaches to semi-
supervised learning which are more similar in
spirit to ours. Ivanov et al (2001) used discrimi-
native training in a reinforcement learning context
in a similar way to our adding of a discriminative
training step to an unsupervised context. A large
body of work uses semi-supervised learning for
clustering by imposing constraints on clusters. For
instance, in (Basu et al, 2004), the clustering sys-
tem was supplied with pairs of instances labeled
as belonging to the same or different clusters.
7 Conclusion
We presented a semi-supervised algorithm based
on IBM Model 4, with modeling and search ex-
tensions, which produces alignments of improved
F-measure over unsupervised Model 4 training.
We used these alignments to produce transla-
tions of higher quality.

The semi-supervised learning literature gen-
erally addresses augmenting supervised learning
tasks with unlabeled data (Seeger, 2000). In con-
trast, we augmented an unsupervised learning task
with labeled data. We hope that Minimum Error /
Maximum Likelihood training using the EMD al-
gorithm can be used for a wide diversity of tasks
where there is not enough labeled data to allow
supervised estimation of an initial model of rea-
sonable quality.
