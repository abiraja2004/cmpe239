THE FINITE STRING 
NEWSLETTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR CORUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS 
The members and Executive Committee of the Association will 
soon have to choose among limiting the scope of the Journal, 
making its content more compact and its content more con- 
cise, or increasing dues. The production budget alows for 
no more than 20 fiches per year. The rate of arrival of ac- 
ceptable manuscripts and news that's fit to print is going 
above the level that can be accommodated in that budget. 
Members who prefer one of the three recognized courses of 
action, or who have another to propose, can write to the 
Editor, the President, or any member of the Editorial Board 
or Executive Committee. 
AMERICAN JOUFWL OF COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS is published 
by the Center for Applied Linguistics for the Association 
for Computational Linguistics.

A new, standardizedthreeltep procedure has been announced by 
NSF for reconsideration of proposals initially declined. 
1. Program Director is to supply explanation on request 
2. Investigator is to request reconsideration within 
180 days after rejection of proposal 
3. Deputy Director is to review proposals on request 
within 180 days of reconsideration as in Step 2. 
Re-examkne administrative judgments 
as to scientific merit; can call for 
additional peer review 
No further review will be made following these three steps, 
but a new proposal can be submitted. "New" means "substantially 
revhed"

The 45th Summer Llngulstlc InstlWte ol the Linguistic Swiety of 
America is being hosted by the State University of New Yoh at Its Oswego 
campus. The institute has traditionally offered courses In particular 
aspeats of linguislics which are not readily available to students and 
faculty on their home campuses. 
The institute focusing on two major themes. "Language Varlatlon in 
America." In keeping with the bicentennial year, and "Languepe Univer- 
sals and Typology." will include oourses, lectures and seminars on these 
themes by internationally known scholsrs 
The Institute curriculum has been designed specificaliy to emphasize 
important Current developments In the dlaoipllne, the mutual contrlbutlons 
of linguistics and related disclpiines to one another, and the corn 
munication of these oontributions to linguists and noniinguists alike. 
Courses will meet Monday, Tuasday. Thursday and Friday for one hour 
and 15 minutes unless otherwise spedilied. An additionat 1 and tYI hours 
w r  week is to be arranged in consultation with the instructor. Please con- 
sult the Institute flnal brochure tor course descriptions and prereduisltes 
Students who reglster for a course numbered 500 or above must be 
graduate students and prepared to do independent research in addition to 
following regular classroom work. Seniors may by petition to the 
Graduate Dean, be admltted to courses at the 5W level if they fulfiiCthe 
prerequisites, and show that they are capable of work at the graduate 
level 
COURSE OFFERINGS 
Courses include undergraduate and graduate offerings. In order to most 
effectively offer oourses for linguists, and for teachers and scholars out- 
side the field of iingui$tics, the Institute will offer ?-weak. Meek,  Rwwk 
and bweek courses. 
The divlsion of the 8-week period 
into units of 2 weeks and 6 weeks 
is designed to glve linguists and 
nonlinguists an opportunity to ob- 
tain a structured sequence ot 
courses outside their particular 
area of specialization. A 2-week 
intensive Introductory course will 
be followed by 6-w& courses in 
areas ot interest to both linguists 
and nonlinguists. At the same 
time that students from other 
fields pursue the 2-week Intanstve 
introduction to Linguistics. 
linguists can aiu, take advantage 
01 courses in interdisciplinary 
topics Basic and advanced 
linguistics courses will be oflered 
as 4-week and Bweek courses. 
Courses listing only language 
requirements or introductory 
courses as prerequisites. and 
those without prerequisites, will 
be open to advanced un- 
dergraduate as well as to 
graduate students. 
Full-time student participants will register for 8 or 9 credlts Some typlcai 
combinations might include:

July 12 
.' 
(1) two &week coursqs 
(2) one 2-week intensive and two %we& courses 
(3) one 2-wdek intensive course, one 6-week and one &week course 
i4) one +weak intensive course. one 4-week course, and one bweek 
course 
No one may, however, register tor more than one Intensive course nor 
ontakr more than 9 semester hours of credlt Language arts teachers acd 
protaasional people In other fields am encwraged to take advantage of 
the 2-week plus Gweek structured sequence. Unguists are also en- 
couraged to explore related fields while pursuing more specialized in- 
terests in Rngulstlcs.

SUMMARY 
The IBM 7040144 computer program described in this Memorandum 
is capable of applying a grammar consisting of unusually 
powerful rules to sentences in a natural language so as to 
discover their underlying structures All solutions allowed 
by the gramnar are found The Memorandum discusses the nota- 
tion used to write rules and the extent to which they can be 
made to state the same linguistic facts as a transformational 
grammar. 
NOTE 
This research was supported by the United States Air Force 
under Project RAND--Contract No. F44620-67-C-0045--monitored 
by the Directorate of Operational Requirements and Development 
Plans, Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development, Hq 
USAF. Views or conclusions contained in this Memorandum 
should mat be interpreted as representing the official opinion 
or policy of the United States Air Force. 
Originally published by The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, 
California. as Memorandum RM-5452-PR, October 1967. 
Also published in the Proceedings of the International Confe- 
rence on Computational Linguistics, Grenoble, 1967. 
Any but the nost rudimentary tasks in automatic 
lanquage :>roce~sinq ncccssnrily involve o procedure which 
makes the grammatical structure of sentences c?xplicib and. 
cliscovcrs qrammatical a~1,iquitics. :.!ost exir;tinq programs 
are capable of applying context-free phrase-structure 
qrammars to the sentences anrl t!lc various techniciues for 
doinq this arc, by now, fairly well unrlcrstood. Ilowcvcr, 
this kind of grapnar is now qcnerally consitlered t6 be 
inadequate because it fails to revcnl t!le most important 
properties of the majority of sentences and becnuse it 
typically dctlarcs a sentence to be more amhiquous than 
it really is. These difficulties are overcome to some 
extent by context-sensitive grammars and to a large extent 
by transformational granmars. The proqram discussed in 
this :%emorandurn is capable of analyzinq sentences with 
context-sensitive qranmars and with grammars cf a class 
very similar to that of transformational qrammvs. 
Experimentation with tinis program is still in its very 
early stages, but the results reported here suqqest that 
the technique used may prove to he a powerful and efficient 
tool for language analysis. If so, it can hope to find 
application in informational retrieval, command and 
control. intelligence analysis and many other areas. 
AJCL will reprint from time to time contributions recognized 
to have signal importance in the history of computational 
linguistics and continuing value to students and practitioners.

AJCL EDITOR'S NOTE 
In August, 1975, the  Washington Office of AFIPS began publishing 
a Report. By the  time the Report's existence came t o  be known 
to AJCL, and arrangements fo r  reprinting were s e t t l ed ,  the 
f i r s t  volume of the Report had been completed and the second 
well begun. 
We begin with the en t i r e  back f i l e ;  henceforth the Report w i l l  
appear regularly i n  AJCL, omitting only those items tha t  AFIPS 
does not permit to  be reprinted (for example, on account of 
r e s t r i c t i ons  imposed by third-party copyright owners). 
The news from Washington may be good or bad, but is' always 
important t o  those who l i ve  a s  close to  the Federal Government 
as educators and researchers,  not to  mention engineers, must 
do. --DGH

WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS 
September, 1975 
NEW LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY ON WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVICE 
Representatives Teague and Mosher have introduced a new b i l l  .(H.R. '9058)to pro- 
vide f o r  s c i e n t i f i c  advice t o  t h e  President ,  which in tegra tes  some major fea tu res  
of  two e a r l i e r  b i l l s  introduced by Teague and the  Ford Administration, respect ive-  
l y  (Washington Report, 8/75).  
Back round. There have been various science advisory mechanisms in the  White + ouse over the  years ,  a t  times having a recognit ion of information processing. 
In 1957 President  Eisenhower, i n  response t o  in te rna t iona l  developments. in  mi s -  
s i l e  technology, appointed a Special Ass i s t an t  t o  the  President  f o r  Science and 
Technology, and a Pres iden t ' s  Science Advisory Comi t t e e  (PSAC) which consisted 
of  non-government s c i e n t i s t s  and engineers;  in 1959, he a l so  es tab l i shed  the Fed- 
e ra l  Council f o r  Science and Technology, which was composed of  r epresen ta t ives  of 
the  major science-oriented agencies. President  Kennedy, in 1962, i n s t i t u t i o n a l i z e d  
White House involvement in science policy by c rea t ing  the  Office of  Science and 
Technology (OST) i n  the  Executive Q f f i c e  o f  the  President .  As of  1970 OST included 
a s t a f f  member f o r  computers, Dr. A. Michael Noll. However, President  Nixon abol- 
ished PSAC and OST in 1973, t r ans fe r r ing  OST's functions (except  those r e l a t i n g  t o  
nat ional  secur i ty )  t o  the  Office of  the  Director  of  the  National Science Foundation, 
Dr. H .  Guyford Stever .  While Stever  was simultaneously appointed Science Advisor 
t o  the  Pres iden t ,  the  post was o rgan iza t iona l ly  removed t o  agency l eve l ,  and Stever  
was e f fec t ive ly  barred from White House policy level  discussions during the  Nixon 
Administration. The Ford Administratian, in con t ras t ,  has recenxly shown several  
s igns of wil l ingness t o  r e i n s t a t e  a science advisor  in the  White House. 
,H .R .  9058 d i f f e r s  from e a r l i e r  b i l l s  i n  two important respects .  F i r s t ,  in  con t ras t  
t o  the  Administration b i l l  and t o  S tever ' s  present  r o l e ,  H . R .  9058 would s p e c i f i -  
ca l ly  d i r e c t  t h e  new science advisor  t o  render advice in the  a rea  of  nat ional  secu- 
r i t y .  Second, i n  l i e u  of  the  maior organizat ional  reform proposed in the  o r ig ina l  
Teague Bi l l  (H.R. 4461) t o  provide a cen t ra l i za t ion  o f  s c i e n t i f i c  research and 
development, the  new b i l l  would simply i n i t i a t e  a major study t o  assess the  t o t a l  
Federal science and t e c h o l o g y  e f f o r t ,  devoting p a r t i c u l a r  a t t en t ion  t o  organiza- 
t iona l  reform. Since the  e a r l i e r  Teague Bi l l  would have consolidated major Fed- 
e ra l  s c i e n t i f i c  and technical  information organizat ions,  the  s tudy approach i s  
expected t o  c rea te  considerably l e s s  p o l i t i c a l  r e s i s t ance .  Nevertheless, the  b i l l  ' s  
prospects f o r  enactment remain unclear. Although AFIPS and o t h e r  s c i e n t i f i c  soc i -  
e t i e s  were t o l d  by an o f f i c i a l  o f  the  Domestic Council in a White House b r ie f ing  on 
J u l y  30 t h a t  t h e  b i l l  was perceived t o  be a good one, i t  has not  y e t  received the  
public  support of  the  Ford Administration.

GENERAL ACtOUNTING OFFICE REPORTS WASTE IN COMPUTER SYSTEM ACQUISTIONS U N D E R  
RDERAL GRANTS 
The General Accounting Office has submitted a repor t  to  the Congress which f inds  
t h a t ,  due t o  the  lack of appropriate Federal procedures, rec ip ients  of Federal 
grants f o r  acquis i t ion  of data processing equipinent have been allowed t o  u t i l i z e  
unsatisfactory procurenlent pract ices .  The report s t a t ed  t ha t  grantees: obtained 
new computer equipment without thoroughly evaluating t h e i r  needs; obtained t h e i r  
own computer systems w i t h o ~ t  adequately exploring opportunities f o r  j o in t  use of 
exis t ing  computer f a c i l i t i e s ;  leased equipment f o r  shor t  periods of time without 
fu l l y  considering the savings from purchasing o r  long term leas ing;  and consider- 
ed primarily mainframe manufacturers as sources of equipment supply, while giving 
l i t t l e  consideration t o  reduced-price sources such as leasing firms, used computer 
suppl iers ,  and independent manufacturers of peripheral equipment. The report re- 
comends t ha t  Federal agencies es tabl ish  consis tent  and economical acquisit ion pm- 
cedures, and t h a t  grantor agencies be required t o  ensure grantee cooipliance. New 
procedures may indi rec t ly  impact pr ivate  ( e . g . ,  university) as well as s t a t e  and 
1 ocal government grantees.  
NBS AND ADIS-TO JOINTLY DEVELOP COMPUTER INTERFACE STANDARDS 
The I n s t i t u t e  f o r  Computer Science and Technology (ICST) in the National Bureau 
of Standards (NBS), and the Automated Data and Telecammunications Service (ADTS) 
in the General Services Administration (GSA) have announced t h a t  they will  jo in t -

s u l t  of the program i s  to  f a c i l i t a t e  the  competitive Federal procurement of com- 
puter peripheral equipment. 
ICST's overall char ter  i s  t o  develop standards re la ted  t o  information processing, 
and ADTS i s  responsible for  automated data processing equipment procurement 
throughout the Federal government. The NBSIGSA program wi l l :  assess Federal 
government ,experience with multivendor computer systems and produce a report t o

ning, se lec t ion and operation of  multivendor systems; analyze comparativeLy the 
device level in ter face  employed in high density disk drives; and evaluate t he  
technological and economic impact of computer in ter face  standards in the i i t e rna -  
t ional  , national and Federal s ec to r s .

WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS 
COMPUTER RESEARCH MAINTAINS STATUS IN NSF REORGANIZATION 
Computer research has maintained i t s  status through the  course o f  t h e  recent  major 
reorganizat ion i n  the  National Science Foundation (NSF). Under the  new organiza- 
t i o n a l  s t ructure,  computer research w i l l  be conducted I R  the  Computer Science 
Section (CSS) o f  t h e  D i rec to ra te  f o r  Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and Engi- 
neer ing (MPE). The reorganizat ion i s  designed t o  provide a more e f f e c t i v e  manage- 
ment st ructure,  and t o  balance research a c t i v i t y  among t h e  new Directorates.  
Impact o f  the Reorganization. Dr. John R. Pasta, d i r e c t o r  f o r  the  former D i v i s i o n  
o f  Computer Research, w i l l  assume broader r e s p o n s i b i l i t y  as the  d i r e c t o r  o f  the  
new D iv is ion  o f  Mathematlcal and Computer Sciences. Assuming Dr. Pasta's e a r l i e r  
r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s ,  Mr. Kent Cur t i s  w i l l  become t h e  new head o f  the  Computer Sciences 
Section. According t o  Dr. Pasta, the recogn i t i on  o f  computer science r e f l e c t e d  I n  
the  reorganizat ion w i l l  help t o  insure t h a t  i t continues t o  be viewed as a unique 
d i s c i p l i n e  w i t h i n  NSF; the $12 m i l l i o n  budget f o r  research i n  t h i s  area w i l l  r a i n  
unaffected. 
Grants f o r  computer research. NSF awards grants t o  support research i n  Computer 
Science, Computer Engineering, and C m p l ~ t e r  Appl icat ions.  CSS, I n  an e f f o r t  t o  
assess p r i o r 1  t i e s  as seen from researchers i n  t h e  f i e l d ,  w i l l  continue the  p o l i c y  
o f  accepting u n s o l i c i t e d  proposals from any source. While u n i v e r s i t i e s  are expect- 
ed t o  be primary rec ip ien ts  o f  grants, other organizat ions are e l l g i b l e  f o r  support. 
With in CSS, p r i o r i t i e s  i n  research funding are r e f l e c t e d  i n  the  various programs, 
and program d i r e c t o r s  are the primary decis ion makers i n  determining grants; these

FCC APPROVES WESTERN UNION REQUEST TO PROVIDE PACKET-SWITCHED SERVICE 
The FCC has approved a request from Western Union International to  provide a packet- 
switched service between the United Sta tes  and the United Kingdom, for  the Advanced 
Research Project Agency (ARPA) in the Oepartment of Defense. The service i s  experi- 
mental i n  nature, and will  be the f i r s t  t ransat lant ic  application of packet-switch- 
ing technology. I t  will  be used as a basis for gaining experience in transmitting 
between two packet networks ( the  second network being the Experimental Packet-Switch- 
ed System in  the United Kingdom), and to  explore the use of s a t e l l i t e s  in interna- 
t ional networks. 
NBS A~NOUNCES NEW COBOL STANOARD 
The Repartment of Comerce has approved a new Federal Information Processing Standard 
(FIPS) 22-1, which makes Cobol-74 the new language standard applicable to  a l l  Federal 
agencies. Cobol i s  the only programing language for  which a Federal standard has 
been established. I t  i s  maintained on a voluntary basis,  and i s  presently used by 
8 government agencies. The new standard will  require Cobol compliers used by the 
Federal government t o  comply with the 1974 Ansi Cobol specifications, and vendors 
will be required to  categorize t he i r  compilers within one of four NBS levels,  each 
of which consists of a speci f ic  s e t  of Ansi "functional processing modules." 
PROGRAM ERROR GENERATES MASSfVE SOCIAL SECURITY OVERPAYMENT 
The c m i s s i o n e r  of the Social Security Administration has t e s t i f i ed  before an over- 
s ight  comi t t ee  of the House Ways and Means Comittee t ha t  Social Security overpay- 
ments of $461 million have been ident i f ied ,  and that  the actual t o t a l  may be as high 
as $800 million. The er rors  were made largely or en t i r e ly  through the conlputer 
system which supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Changes in a

WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS 
NATIONAL COMlISSION ON LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ANNOUNCES GOALS 
The National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) ha$ s ta ted  
its long range program i n  a docment recently transmitted t o  the House Conunittee 
on Education and Labor. 
NcLI.9. The Comission, established by s t a t u t e  i n  1970, i s  chartered t o  advise 
the  President and the  Congress on na t iona l  policy re la ted  t o  l ib ra ry  and infor-  
mation services;  i t s  major program objectives a r e  (1) t o  develop resources sup- 
por t ive  of high qua l i ty  l ib ra ry  and information se rv ices ,  and ( 2 )  t o  form a 
national  network of l ib ra ry  and information f a c i l i t i e s .  Specif ic  objectives 
a r e  t o  " k]ncourage the p r iva te  sec tor  . . . t o  become an ac t ive  partner i n  the 
development of the  National Program," as  well as  t o  ensure adequate l ib ra ry  and 
in fomat ion  se rv ices ,  provide adequate special  se rv ices ,  strengthen s t a t e  re-  
sources, ensure education of r e l a t e d  personnel, coordinate Federal programs, and 
es tab l i sh  a locus of Federal respons ib i l i ty  fo r  t h e  National Program. 
Nationwide netwrk.  The Commission envisions a nationwide network of l i b r a r i e s  
and in fomat ion  centers encompassing s t a t e  networks, mul t i s ta te  networks, and 
special ized ne twrks  i n  the  public and pr iva te  sec tors ;  the def in i t ion  of "net- 
work" i n  this cmntext includes computers and computer communications, although 
it extend3 t o  cmventional  telephone and te le type  devices as wel l .  
While the  Federal government would ne i ther  d i r e c t l y  control  nor operate the net-  
work, it would have respons ib i l i ty  f o r  aiding the  development of compatible net-  
works, fu r ther ing  c o m n  prac t ices ,  and increasing coordination between the  p r i -  
va te  and public sec tors ;  it would a l so  "collaborate with appropriate professional  
s o c i e t i e s  i n  promulgating i n t e r s t a t e  technical  s tandards,  support the introduction 
of  addit ional  c o y u t e r  a n d  telecommunications f a c i l i t i e s  as needed f o r  i n t e r s t a t e  
purposes, and he lp  es tab l i sh  protocols governing the  way transactions a re  handled 
by the network." 
Other Federal (as opposed t o  p r iva te )  respons ib i l i t i e s  iden t i f i ed  by the  Comis- 
s ion  include developing central ized services f o r  networking, exploring computer 
use, applying new forns  of telecommunications, and supporting research and devel 
opment. 
Copies of the  present  National Program Document (U) may be obtained through the  
MIPS Washington Office; comments are,  as noted above, encouraged by NCLIB.

FEDERAL PRIVACY ACT IMPLEMENTATION 
Ihe  Privacy Act of 1974 took ef fec t  on September 27,  amidst certain unresolved 
questions as  t o  i t s  operation. 
l h e  Department of Health, Education and Welfare has characterized i t s e l f  as a 
s ingle  agency f o r  purposes of the Act, allowing (barring fur ther  Congressio- 
nal  response) the 11 separate agencies within HEW t o  exchange personal data f i l e s  
without the disclosure records required fo r  t ransfers  between other Federal agen- 
cies.  
In a separate development, members of Congress expressed concern over the fac t  
t ha t  sone agencies were in terpre t ing the Act t o  preclude Congressional access t o  
agency f i l e s  of personal data.  Members of Congress frequently request such 
access t o  aid t he i r  constituents i n  dealing with Federal agencies. The s i tua t ion 
was resolved, temporarily a t  l e a s t ,  by an OMB memo recommending that each agency 
es tabl ish  Congressional access as a "routine use" of a system of records under 
the Act; the ef fec t  on the OMB procedure w i l l  be t o  obviate the need fo r  niembcrs 
of Congress t o  obtain written consent i n  order t o  access a constituent 's  data 
f i l e .  
Finally,  Sen. Kennedy has taken :I strong issue  with a Jus t ice  Department opinion 
which operated t o  exempt records which an agency had exempted from public access 
under the  Privacy Act, from access under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
as well. In response t o  Kennedy's objection, the Jus t i ce  Department has proposed 
a new regulation which would allow the FOIA t o  apply t o  records exempted from the 
Privacy Act, but only a t  an agency's d iscre t ion.  
POLITICS AND PRIVACY 
A number of prominent pol i t ic ians  have been addressing the privacy issue  recently,  
most notably President Ford. In an address ((1 a t  Stanford Law School, Ford spoke of 
the need t o  balance the individual r i gh t  of privacy with the government's l e g i t i -  
mate need fo r  information related t o  i t s  program. While Ford made c lear  h i s  in- 
tolerance of i l l e g a l  invasions of privacy, h is  coments were primarily directed 
toward threats  t o  privacy which resul t  from otherwise benef ic ia l  programs; i n  
such areas,  he said, ' k e  must protect every individual from excessive and unnec- 
essary intrusions by a Big Brother bureaucracy." In a separate statement Ford 
l a t e r  sa id  t ha t  "N eeping only an essent ia l  minimum of these records i s  the most 
ef fec t ive  protection we have" against incursions on privacy. 
Sen. Tunney, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, recently re- 
affirmad h i s  concern with privacy i n  a speech (#) on the Senate f loor .  He noted 
t ha t  h i s  Subcommittee was presently moving b i l l s  which: would prohibit  military 
spying on c iv i l ians ;  would provide fo r  control of criminal records (Washington 
Report, 9/75); and would secure greater  privacy protection fo r  government employ- 
ees. Turtney pointed out the need t o  ant ic ipate  technological threats  t o  privacy, 
an endeavor i n  which AFIPS has already offered assistance t o  the Senator. 
Speaking i n  a recent interview i n  EDP Weekly, Rep. Goldwater s ta ted  t ha t  he hoped 
f o r  an a t t i t ude  of support and voluntary compliance with privacy protection prin- 
c ip les  i n  the  colmPercia1 sector .  While he f ee l s  tha t  the business sector has an 
incentive t o  be concerned with privacy as a "good business practice," he fee ls  
t ha t  a s imi lar  incentive does not ex i s t  i n  the area of government; he pointed out,  
however, t ha t  he expects the s t a t e s  t o  enact t he i r  own privacy legis la t ion ,  and 
t ha t  the  Privacy Commission Cof which he i s  a member) would be looking primarily 
a t  the  Federal-state relationship. In a speech a t  the recent IEEE Computer 
Society CWCON, Goldwater a lso  urged the  information processing community t o  
provide technical input as a bas is  fo r  reasonable l eg i s l a t i on .  
CONTROVERSY ON,DEFENSE IR$D PROGRAM 
?he Department of Defense Independent Research and Development IIRl,ll) progr~mr 
has been the subject of controversy i n  hearings before the  Senate Irmed Services 
Subcommittee. The program permits defense contractors t o  charge part  of t he i r  
general R 6 D programs as overhead-on defense contrac ts ;  i t s  cost i n  1975 ros 
over $800 million do l l a r s .  
Proponents of the program argued tha t  it allows contractors t o  keep abreast of 
current technological developments, and t ha t  it allows the mi l i tary  to  buy .td- 
vnnCed e lec t ronic  sys tem a t  a l e s se r  cost than i f  developed under n. J i r cc t l y  
funded R 6 D program. Cr i t i c s  of the program, however, t e s t i f i e d  that  ~t allow:. 
firms t o  charge p a r t  of the cost of developing commercial projec ts  t o  t he i r  mi l i -  
t a ry  contracts;  Admiral Hyman Rickover, heatl of the  Navy Nuclear Propulsion 
Program, recornended tha t  the program be eliminated. 
COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS RULING ENJOINED FROM IFIPLEMENTATION 
The Comptroller of the  Currency has suspended h i s  December, 1974 rul ing (#) tha t  
Customer-Bank Comunication Terminals (CBCT's) are  not branch banks within the 
meanipg of the laws governing nat ional  banks. A decision l a s t  Ju ly  i n  the Federal 
D i s t r i c t  Court i n  Washington (Washington Report ,  9/75) had enjoined fuxther imple- 
mentation of the ru l ing,  but it remained i n  e f f ec t  while the Comptroller requested 
a s tay  of the D i s t r i c t  Court decision, pending appeal; on Octaber 10 the stay was 
denied and the ru l ing immediately suspended.

AFIPS IN WASHINGTON 
MIPS BRIEFS DOMESTIC COUNCIL PRIVACY COMMITTEE DIRECTOR 
On October 3rd, representatives of AFIPS societies provided a briefing to Qulncy 
Rodgers, executive director of the White House Domestic Council Privacy Committee. 
The briefing to Rodgers was primarily in anticipation of a vice-presidential round- 
table on Privacy and Information Policy. AFIPS participants were: Daniel McCracken 
(ACM), Charles Meadow (ASIS), Bill Moser (DPMA), and Bruce Peters (IEEE Computer 
Society). 
The objective of the briefing was to provide Rodgers an assessment, from the 
prospective of professionals in the information processing field, of issues relat- 
ed to Federal government information policy. Vice President Rockefeller, chairman 
of the Domestic Council Privacy Committee, 1s concerned with the development of a 
comprehensive policy which would view these Issues in a broad perspective, in 
contrast to the ad hoc fashion in which they are presently handled by the Federal 
government. 
COORDINATING AFIPS COWITTEES AND WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES 
Since several existing MIPS committees address areas of continuing interest in 
Washington, an effort is undexway to closely coordinate such committees with the 
activities of the AFIPS Washington Office and to make the facilities of the office 
available in connection with relevant committee work. AFIPS committees initially 
identified for close liaison include those on Privacy, EFTS and Statistics. 
AFIPS NASHINGTON ACTIVITIES CWIITEE MEETS IN WASHINGTON 
An MIPS Washington Activities Committee meeting was held In Washington on October 
8, attended by MIPS Presiden Tony Ralston and Executive Director Robert Rector. 
In additian t o  conducting i t s  regular review and assessment of Washington Office 
ac t iv i t ies ,  the Connnittee resolved to  pursue specific projects with the Federal 
Communications Commission [FCC) and the In s t i t u t e  for Computer Sciences and Tcch- 
nology (ICST) a t  the National Bureau of Standards; both of these projects are 
presently i n  an exploratory phase. The objective of the FCC project i s  a major 
briefing t o  the Commission, assessing the impact of developments ~n computer 
coi!ninmications on FCC regulation and the ICST project i s  oriented toward an 
assessment of the scope, character and impact of computer s c i e n c ~  as a discipline. 
N6W WASHINGTON- RGPORT POLICIES 
At i t s  recent meeting, the Washington Activities Committee established three major 
policies for  the AFIPS Washington Report: 
Subscriptions t o  the Washington Report shal l  be, for the present, 
available upon request. While the publication i s  viewed primarily 
as a member service t o  MIPS socie t ies ,  i t  i s  available to  non- 
AFIPS groups and individuals as  well. Ib  i s  anticipated that sub- 
scription charges will  be imposed a t  a future date,  with approprl- 
a t e  d i f ferent ia ls  for  AFIPS socie t ies  and society members. 
Key documents discussed or cited in the Washlnyton Report will  be, 
made available through the Washington Office upon request, whcre 
feasible; avai labi l i ty  will  be indicated by a " ( # ) ' I  symbol i n  the 
text of the Washington Report. 
In appropriate instances, the Washington Report will  so l i c i t  comments 
and provide a f o r m  fo r  discussion of par t icular  events or programs i n  
the Federal government. 
In addition t o  the foregoing services, AFIPS societies can, of course, contact the 
Washington Office for assistance i n  connect i~n with any matters discussed in the 
Washington Report; it i s  indeed hoped that arhicles w i l l  precipitate both .inquiries 
and comment. 
Z S P U W S  WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING

WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS 
FCC APPROVES DIRECT INTERCONNECTION OF TERMINAL EQUIPMENT 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that users may directly 
connect terminal equipment to the telephone network without the use of carrier- 
supplied connecting arrangements, provided they comply with FCC requirements. 
The ruling (#) is to become effective April 1, 1976. 
Impact of the decision. The ruling will permit users to connect computer termi- 
nal equipment to the network without the necessity of either a modem supplied by 
the common carrier (generally ATFjT) or a telephone company data access arrange- 
ment (DAA); the D M  had previously been required if a Bell modem were not used. 
While circuitry similar to the DAA will still have to be incorporated in customer- 
supplied equipment, it is expected to be considerably less expensive to users 
than present AT&T lease charges. 
Xistory. The FCC ruling requiring the use of telephone company connecting ar- 
rangements for user-supplied terminals has been the subject of controversey ever 
since its implement?tioh after the Carterfone decision (which allowed the connec- 
tion of custo,mer-provided equipment) in 1968. The common carriers have argued 
that such arrhghents are necessary to protect the network against potential 
hams, such as those identified by a 1970 National Academy of Sciences study: 
hazardous valtages, excessive signal power levels, excessive longitudinal imbal- 
ance, and imp,roper network control signaling. Opponents maintain, however, that 
the telephone cmpanies have insisted on carrier-supplied access arrangements to 
protect their own revenues. 
Registration program. The FCC will allow interconnection only if it is done 
through either protective circuitry registered with the FCC, or directly through 
equipment which is itself registered. The Commission has also required that 
carrier-supplied terminal equipnient be registered (a requirement not generally 
imposed on comon carriers) in order to enhance network protection, insure compet- 
itive equality (between carriers and non-carriers) in the manufacture of such 
equipment, and to prov'i'de a "benchmark" against which to judge non-carrier 
applications. 
Possible appeal. ATBT is expected to appeal the FCC ruling, which may delay its 
effective date. Further, the ruling applies only to the technical aspects of 
intercomection; a separate proceeding (Docket 20003) is underway to examine the 
potential economic harm from competition in this area. A reversal of the technical 
ruling would appear unlikely on economic grounds, since data communications devices 
account for only the small portion of ATET revenues.

OTP REPORT ON SOCIAL ISSUES IN EPTS 
The White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTY) has relensed a study 
on the non-economic implications of EFTS, entitled "Value Choices in Electronic 
Funds Trnnsfer Policy." In transmitting the study to the Vice President, OTP 
Acting Director John Eger said "both because of our particular mandate to evolve 
policy relating to the intorconncction of contputers with teleconununications, an 
intcrconncction which is tlie necessary foundation of any EFT system, and because 
of our concern for i,.formed and cffcctive formnulution of policy in the executive 
brdnch, DTP has begun to scrutinize closely the increasing range of Fedcral gov- 
ernmcnt activity in this area. . . . While mnny of the aost significant economic 
questions have becn rarscd, critical non-ecunomic issues have not bccn addressed- 
such as the desirability of unrcttered govcfnltrent acccss to pcrsonnl records ei- 
ther as a user or an operator of alty EFT system." A prim:~ry signific:lnce of the 
rcport is thc indication that OTP is squarely concc~ncd irith the social in~p:ict of 
EFTS. This subjctt is presently comlsidcrcd (or pl;~nncd to I)c considered) only 
peripherally by groups such ns the I'rivacy Cummission, the IiF'l'S Cot~~mnission, or 
the Fedcral Co~~~i~~nications Cu~~unission. 
IVIIITE llOUSE SCIENCE AIIVISER R1I.L PASSES HOUSE 
--- --
A new bill to cst.tblish a prcsidcntial scicnce adv~ser, 1i.R. 10230, has bccn 
passed (362-28) in the Ilo~~se of Reprcsentntivcs. The lcgislntion, draftcd coop- 
er~tivcly by the Ford Admninistrntion and llousc scicnce lc.idcrs, is a revision of 
H.R. 9058 (Washinyton Report, 9/75). 
In its present form, the bill (1) cstdblishcs-a nntlon:~l polxcy for scicncc and 
technology, (2) establishes an Office of Scicnce 4 Technology Policy (OSI'P) in 
the White House, and (3) establishes a Federal Scicnce 6 l'cclinology Survcy Conunit- 
toe (the Survey Committee) in thc White IIouse. The Survey Comlu~iittce rill have two 
years to analyze Federal science and technology cfforts .ind lcport its findings to 
the President, trho must subsequently review and transnut the report to Congress 
with his recommendations. The director OF OSI'P will scrve as the President's Scl- 
ence Adviser, and as chairman of the Survey Co~imittce. 
Despite the likelihood of this bill becoming l~w, thcrc rca1.1ins serious concern in 
the scicnce commln~unity ( c . g . ,  llillinm C:lrey's editorial in thc Koven~ber 21 issue of 
Science) that science budgets may sufrcr st~bst:~mitinl cutb,~chs in Prosident Ford's 
program to reduce Federal cxpcndituncs by $28 million. 
NEW NSF ADVISORY GROUPS 
President Ford has created two new science advisory groups withln the National 
Science Fo,undation, to advise him on planning for tlie proposed Office of Science 4 
Technology Policy (see above surmnary of H.R. 10230). These arc; respectively, the 
Anticipated Advances in Science 4 Technology Advisory Group, and the Contributions 
of Technology to Economic Strength Advisory Group. The former group, headed by 
Dr. William 0. Baker (president, Bell Labs) will advise the President on national 
policy implications of developments in science and engineering; the latter group, 
headed by Dr. Simon Ramo (board vice chairman, TRN) will advise on imitproving the 
utilization of technology to foster economic strength. 
In additian to the advisory group chairmen, other members related to the con~puting 
field include Lew Branscomb (Vice President and Chief Scientist, IBM), Joseph Charyk, 
(president, Comsat) and Patrick Haggerty, (board chairman, Texas Instruments).

PRIVACY COMMISSION ACTIVITIES 
The Commission is presently investigating eight topical areas. It has thus far 
produced staff reports in four of these, "The Use of Mailing Lists in the Private 
Sector," "The Use of the Social Security Number in the Private Soctor," "Disclo- 
sure of Federal Income 'Tax Returns to Third Parties,ll and "Credit Card Kccord- 
Keeping: The InFormational Privacy Issues," and it has inunediatc plans to look in- 
to the remaining areas: consumer credit reporting, en~ployment records, social 
services, and statistical research. The Commission presently receives input from 
its own staff (which will be supplemented by contractual support of about $50 
thousand per year), industrial groups and non-profit organizations such as AFIPS. 
The Commissioners rcccntly indicated that they will not postponc their rccommenda- 
tion until their final report is due (June, 1977), but will publish proposed rcc- 
ommendations for public commcnt as the Commission proceeds.

NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FORMS AI) llOC COMPUTER SCIENCI; P M N I N I ;  (;RO!iI! 
The Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MIPS) in thc National \c.~Jriny 
of Sciences (NAS) has recently formed an ad hoc ComputerSciences l'lanning Group 
to consider activities which AMPS might undertake in that field. 'Ihc L;rauli is to 
consider "what aspects of this rapidly growing discipline and w h ~ t  probie~~~s rel~t- 
ed to federal and non-federal applications might benefit through special studies, 
particularly by [WS] ." 
The AFIPS Washington Office has confirmed that the formation of the Comliutcr 
Science Planning Group was precipitated in part by letters earlier this year to 
Dr. Philip Handler (president, NAS) from Anthony Ralston and Jean Sammet, presi- 
dents of AFIPS and ACM, respectively. Both Ralston and S m e t  urged Handler to 
consider organizational changes which would recognize computer science as .I sepa- 
rate discipline within the National Research Council [NRC -- the NAS and the 
National Academy of Erlgineering), arguing that this recognition has already oc- 
curred within major universities and throughout most of the academic commun~ty. 
History. There have been a number of activities within the NRC in the last ten 
years which relate to computer science and engineering, most recently the Computer 
Science and Engineering Board (CSEB). The CSEB was in existence from 1968 to 1972, 
chartered to assess the implications of information performing technology with 
regard to the public and private sectors of the United States. The National RE- 
search Council generally operates by performing studies under contract to various 
Federal groups, and occasionally undertakes similar studies on its own initiative; 
there have been no studies primarily related to information processingsince the 
termination of the CSEB. 
While the Academies have approximately n dozen computer scientists and engineers 
as members, the computer science discipline has not been organizationally recog- 
nized outside of existing groups in mathematics and engineering. 
Meeting agenda. At its recent first meeting, the Computer Science Planning Group 
undertook a general discussion of areas which would be candidates for NRC atten- 
tion, including (1) the impact of computers on soclety, (2) computer engineering, 
(3) computer science, and (4) the commercial impact of computer technology. Re- 
ports will be produced in these areas by early 1976. 
Outlook for a permanent group While there is apparently no consensus in the 
Group on how to proceed, it appears highly likely that a recommendation will be 
forthcoming to set up a permanent computer science group within the NRC; the prin- 
cipal unresolved questions relate to the structure of such a group. There are 
presently three other groups proceeding in parallel with the AMPS group, each of 
which will ultimately produce a report recommending NRC activities in this field, 
these are the Assembly of Engineering, the Assembly of Behavorial and Social 
Sciences, and the Connnission on Sociutczhniciil Systems.

WUI AND IT DATA COWNICATIONS \PI'LICA'l'IONS BBFORI: I:CC 
WUI. Western Union International (Wl) has received ;ipproval from th' Fcdcr:ll Com- 
munications Commission (FCC) to Furnish its Internationnl Digital ll;~t;~ Scrv~ce (1DI)S) 
to Prance, Italy, Spain a ~ d  Austria. The scrvico is cl;~imcd to provide high quality 
and reliability, primarily by simultnneous transmission of data by undersca cable 
and satellite. Thc FCC approval is for one year of operation, within whicli IDDS 
must submit an analysis af its service. IDDS will be required to submit a t:~riff 
proposal before beginning service, based on transmission speed (from 50 hits to 9.6 
kilobits per second), transmission volumc and other f:ictors. 
ITT. ITT Domcstic Transmission Systems has filed an application with thc I:CC nsk- 
ing for approval of a domestic data commu~iicntions network. Thc proposed scrvice, 
to be known as Corn-Pak, is a packet-switched system which woul'd be cap.lble of ser- 
vicing incompatible computers and computer terminals. The network would initially 
serve 13 cities by 1977, eventually expnnding to 24 cities. Like other value-added 
carriers (e.g., Telenet) Com-Pak would rely on circuits leased frum common carriers. 
While computer-related transmissions on the network will generally be immeditite, a 
delayed-transmission service (at a lawer price) will also be available to customers 
for'applications such as word processing. 
Related issues. ITT World Comunications has bpposed the FCC authori:ation of IDDS, 
arguing that the FCC should conduct a techaicill inquiry on optimum methods for inter- 
national digitnl data services, before g~xnting the IDDS application. 
On a separate topic, Western Union and other carriers have petitioned the United 
States Court of Appeals in Washington to reverse FCC approval of the proposed CML 
data communications satellite venture (Washington Report, 11/75), asserting that it 
would have monopolistic effect (such as dividing the market for satellite data com- 
munications between ATET and CMI,). The petitioning firms feel the monopoly condi- 
tions which might exist subsequent to CML entry into the market could not be reversed 
by antitrust regulation or litigation. 
COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS SURVEY 
While the EFTS Comission continues to organize, a recent survey released by 
Comptroller of the Currency, James E. Smith, indicates the extent and distribution 
of existing EFTS systems. According tb Smith: 
The survey, which had a response rate of 97 percent of 4,700 national 
banks, showed that fully 10 percent of the banks had at least one 
Automated Teller Machine. As expected, a high proportion of large 
banks have an EFT system - 72.9 percent o t  billion dollar banks and 
48.4 percent of those in the half billion to billion dollar range.

COMPUTER INDUSTRY GROUPS OPPOSE FCC APPROVAL OF AT&T DATA TERMINAL 
IBM, the Computer 6 Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA), and the 
Computer Industry Association (CIA) have all opposed ATfiT's proposed tariff filed 
with the FCC for the Dataspeed 40 terminal device. There is little disphte regard- 
ing the actual functions of the device; the argument is focused primarily on wheth- 
er such functions should be characterized as data communications or data processing 
The fundamental issues, however, are (1) whether the data services embodied in the 
Dataspeed 40 should be subject to government regulation, and (2) whether a govern- 
ment-regulated monopoly (ATBT) should be allowed td manufacture such terminals and 
thus compete with the private enterprise computer industry. The Dataspeed 40 is a 
1920 character CRT terminal and standard teletypewriter keyboard, with optional 
features for functions such as printing and editing. 
The computef industry opponents to AT&T all cite a 1956 consent decree which prohib- 
its AT&T from entering an unregulated industry; further, they refer to the FCC "Com- 
puter Inquiry", which ruled that cdrmnon carriers may provide data processing services 
only through unregulated subsidiaries. The terminal manufacturers fear that the 
Dataspeed 40 will be priced below their competitive offerings, through cross-subsidies 
from othar ATGT services. 
SENATOR BYRD URGES MORATORIUM ON EXPORT OF M)hIPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO U. S .S .R'. 
In a December 18 speech (#) on the Senate floor, Sen. Robert Byrd called for a morato- 
rium on the export of computer technology to the Soviet Union. He recommended that 
the Departments of State and Commerce take immediate steps to institute a program to 
reassess technology export, and to evaluate U.S. gains and losses in technology cur- 
rently exchanged. 
Byrd argued that the export of. computer technology potentially threatens peace, 
rather than promotes it. He noted that "filhe United States has a universally unques- 
tioned superiority in this field . . . . From the standpoint of tefense, the edge in 
military potential that the United States has enjoyed is due, in large part, to our 
application of computer technology to military weaponry." Bryd described American 
intelligence reports that the Soviets had been acquiring computers which can be applied 
to military technology, and that $500 milllm worth of such equipment was acquired from 
the United States last year. 
IBM AND PARTNERS PROPOSE SATELLITE BUSINESS SYSTEMS 
IBM, Comsat and Aetna Insurance have proposed a $250 million network for satellite 
transmission of voice and data communications, to the Federal Communications Cdnunission 
(FCC). The new venture, Satellite Business Systems (SBS), would be equally owned by 
the three uartnere, thereby meeting earlier FCC restrictions on ownership (Washington 
Report, 11/73)). 
The network will be entirely digital, utilizing time division multiplexing. The sat- 
ellites will transmit to rooftop receiving stations at or near customer sites, with 
ground communications (SBS or other) to points which could not support their own re- 
ceivers. Access ports wilI be compatible with industry standards, in accord with 
SBS's stated policy of nondiscrimination in interconnection. 
OTA CREATES HIGH-LEVEL SCIENCE ADVISORY GROUP 
The Congressional Office of Tethnology Assessment (OTA) has organized an advisary 
panel on research and development policies, according to a recent issue of Science 8 
buement .Rsport .  The panel was sai'd to be organized in mid-1975; it was therefore 
not intended to overlap with the Administration's advisory groups which are plsnning 
for the new Presidential science adviser (Washington Report, 1/76). 
The OTA panel, in contrast to the Presidential advisory groups, is largely composed 
of academicians, including Jerome IVicsner (president, MIT and President Kennedy's 
science.adviser) and Donald Hornig (president, Brown University and President Johnson's 
science adviser). Two panel members are closely re1;lted to information processing: 
Lewis Branscomb (vice president and chief scientist, IBM) and Herbert Simon (Carneige- 
Mellon University). Branscomb is one of the few members belonging to both the OTA 
group and the Presidential advisory groups; he will head a special study on applica- 
tlons of science and technology. The panel is funded to October, 1977 at a level of 
$925 thousand.

AFIPS IN WASHINGTON 
AFIPS SEEKS M COMMUNICATE WITH PRESIDENT'S SCIENCE ADVISORY GROUP 
The AFIPS Washington Activities Committee, Anthony Ralston, Robert Rector and the 
Director of the AFIPS Washington Office recently met with Dr. Lewis Branscomb, a 
member of the President's Advisory Group on Contributions of Technology to Economic 
Strength, to discuss national science policy issues related to information processing. 
The Advisory Group, in planning for the establishment of a Presidential science adviser 
(Waehington Report, 12/75), is presently attempting to identify primary science policy 
issues. 
In describing the prospective office of the science adviser, Branscomb said that the 
office will be more open; he further indicated that economic issues will receive high- 
er priority than with the predecessor office (the Office of Sciehce and Technology) 
and that cownerical technology will receive greater attention. He also noted the par- 
ticular interest shown by Dr. Simon Ramo, chairman of the Advisory Group, in the ap- 
plication of computer technology to increase productivity. 
AFIPS COORDINATES EXPERT COMMENT ON DATA CDMMUNICATIOdS ASPECTS OF H.R. 214 
In response to a request from Bep. Charles A. Mosher, the Washington Office coordinated 
expert comment on H.R. 214, a bill which in its amended form would uake it illegal to 
intercept data communicatfons sent over common carriers. Data comhlunications experts 
from whom AFIPS requested comment were Paul Armer, Paul Baran, Martin Hellman, Donn 
Parker and Keith Uncapher. Comments (#) were restricted to the technological aspects 
af the data communications provisions in H.R. 214, and were directed-prirnariIy to the 
point that if the bill is intended to reach data communications generally, it should 
be amended from its present form (which covers only data communications over wire) to 
encompass satellite, microwave and other data communications technologies. During the 
course of developing AFIPS conment, the panel of commentators met In California with 
representatives of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and the National Security

AFIPS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING 
On February 5, 1976, senior officials of AFIPS and its constituent societies were 
givenaYIhite House briefing on Federal government matters of particular relevance 
to the information processing comunity. The brienng was presented by Executive 
Branch spokesmen from the White House as well as from the various Federal agencies 
cognizant of the subject areas addressed, and was arranged through the White House 
OfEce of Public Liaison. The specific topics briefed,were selected on the basis 
of an advance poll taken of the AFIPS attendees. 
The material presented at the briefing, because of its general interest to AFIPS 
beyond the audience which could be accomodated in the Yihite House Family Theater, 
is described at length below. 
OFFICE OF TELECOWNICATIONS POLICY. John Eger, Acting Director of the White House 
Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), began the briefing by describing the man- 
date of his office to formulate policy on the relationship between the Government 
and private sectors in telecommunications. Characterizing the Federal government 
as a primary telecommunications user (a $50 miIlion capital investment, with annual 
expenditures of $10 - $15 billion), Eger raised two fundamental question:. First, 
when should the Federal government provide its own computer communications, and 
when should it rely on the private sector? While the Federal government must be 
careful not to overburden existing common carriers, he said, it should leave as 
much as possible to the private sector and not become a competitor with it. Second, 
what is the proper role of the Federal government in regulation of computer conunu- 
nications? OTP has generally been an advocate of minimal government regulation 
(Washington Report, 8/75), ahd is presently developing this policy in three areas: 
data communications, EFTS, and privqcy. Eger described OTP's systematic review of 
regulatory legislation, and their efforts to eliminate govement regulation where 
possible. 
Roland Homet, Chief of the Studies and Analysis Section af OTP, reviewed the OTP 
analysis of computer communications regulatory questions now before the Federal Com- 
munications Colmission (FCC). Homet noted the earlier FCC "Computer Inquiry" which 
distinquished between data communications and data processing, ruling that the FCC 
would regulate the former but not the latter; he further noted that the same funda- 
mental distinction is now at issue in both the controversey between Telenet and 
p-mshare (Washington Report, 11/75), and the &aspeed 40 tariff now pending before 
the FCC (Washington Report, 2 / 7 6 ) .  He went on, however, to artirulate the critical 
issue underlying these controversies: should the provision of these services and 
goods, however they are characterized, be,subject to government regulation at all? 
While it is, true that the data communications and data processing technologies are 
becoming increasingly integrated, the most crucial question is whether the markets 
they address display the "natural monopoly" conditiqns which have traditionally 
been the justification for Federal economic regulation. aTP has formally taken the 
position that both the sbrvices of value-added carriers (e.g., Telenet), and the 
manufacture of tenninal equipment (e.g., the Dataspeed 40) should be deregulated. 
Charles Joyce (now OTP Special Assistant for  National Security Act iv i t ies  and for- 
merly Assistant Director for  Government Conununications) discussed issucs re la t ing  
to  the Federal government as  a user of computer communications. ra is ing two pr i -  
mary is? ~ c s .  F i r s t ,  as the Government continues t o  develop networks f c r  what have 
t radi t ion  11ly been viewed as  government services (e.g., networks for  biomedical 
communic;~Lions, or  s c i e n t i f i c  and technical information services) ,  when docs the 
Government cease providing a legitimate Federal service and begin t o  infringe on 
services .ihich should be provided by the  pr ivate  sector? Second, how I s  the Pcd- 
era1 government t o  t r ea t  privacy and secur i ty  i n  i t s  computer c o m m ~ ~ c h t i o n s  sys- 
tems? Joyce described the  primary policy fac tors  t o  be balanced as the need for 
privacy and secur i ty  i n  computer networks, and the competing pressure fo r  the c f f i -  
cicnces t o  be achieved in  nctworki~ig and resource sharing. Ife c i t e3  secur i ty  tcch- 
nology as  a pdssible solution, but onewhich requires a substant ia l  technical bas is .  
Joyce ca l led  fo r  assistance on t h i s  question from soc i e t i e s  such as AFIPS, t o  sup- 
pacmont the  expcrtisc OTP prcscntly draws from i t s  own s t a f f  as vo l l  as tha t  of the 
Wllitc llouse Office of hlan;~gmment and Budget, the Nationol Bureau of St;u~Jnrds and 
the Cencra'l Serviccs Administration. 
Tom Keller, OTP General Counsel, addressed OTP a c t i v i t i e s  re la ted  t o  t he  area of 
privacy. In  addition t o  describing the general Federal in teres t  i n  t h i s  area (e.g., 
the Privacy and EFTS Commissions) he pointed out the VIP s tudies  on current legal 
protections re la ted  t o  individual policy (by Prof. Grecnaxalt of Columbia Univer- 
s i t y  Law School) and on the social implications of EFTS (by Prof. Rule of SUNY). 
kel lcr  indicated that  OTP is undertaking a follow-up study on the threats  t o  p r i -  
vacy which may bc posed by a comprehensive EFT system. O'rP i s  par t icular ly  con- 
cerned about information collected by the Federal government, i n  that such infor- 
mation can (in d is t inc t ion t o  the private sector) be compelled by legal process 
Kcller emphasized the OTP position t ha t  pr ivate  sector costs for  enforcement of 
privacy legis la t ion  such as  H . R .  1984, and pr ivate  sec tor  a l ternat ives  t o  Federal 
government privacy protections, should be fu l l y  examined before any re la ted  Fed- 
e r a l  action i s  taken; ho speci f ica l ly  ca l led  for any empirical data which may be 
provided by AFIPS on the compliance costs of Federal privacy legis la t ion .  
In closing, Mr. Bger extcidcd an invi ta t ion  for AI:IPS t o  continue an opcn dialogue 
with OT9, on questions of comnputer communications. 'me future of computer co~a~un i -  
cations, he said, will dcpund I~cnvily on actions tokc11 by the Pedcml govcriimcnt, 
;inJ thcso actions w i l l  in turn depend on the q~rill i ty and impact of t h i s  d i a l o ~ u e .  
T B C W O G Y  TRRNSFER IN INFORITION PROCESSING. Arthur Downey, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce fo r  East-West Trade, began h i s  remarks with a dcscriptioii of 
the co~nplcx F ~ d e r a l  regulatory structure,  r e l a t i ng  t o  the export of computer tech- 
nology. This s t ructure  i s  bas ica l ly  t r i p a r t i t e ,  with the S t a t e  Department playing 
a ro le  under the blutual Security Act of 1954, the Commerce Department playing the 
largest r o l e  (in terms of implementation]. under the Export Administration Act of 
1969, and the Defense Department playing a major policy ro l e  as  required by the 
same 1969 s t a tu t e  [the Pentagon has v i r t ua l l y  a veto power over exports relnted to  
national security]. In  addition, the Trade Act of 1975 has created an oversight 
board for  monitoring the  flow of technology t o  s o c i a l i s t  countries,  t o  be known as 
the East-Nest Foreign Trade Board. 
Downey described "national security" controls as having the  heaviest impact on the 
export &advanced technology t o  soc i a l i s t  countries, while adding that  "foreign 
policy" controls may a lso  play a ro l e  i n  the export of technology t o  speci f ic  coun- 
t r i e s  (e.g., Angola). While there are  several working levels of control, the 
highest i s  a t  the cabinet level i n  the Export Administration Review b a r d ,  which 
i s  comprised of the Secretaries of Sta te  and Defense, who w i l l  soon be joined by 
the Secretary of the Treasury as well .  
a i l e  most products are  exported under a "general license" (which must be obtain- 
ed only once'.lior a category of products), high technology products such as  comput- 
ers  move under "special licenses," which must be obtained fo r  each speci f ic  ship- 
ment. While not defining the terms speci f ica l ly ,  Downey said that "sc ient i f ic  and 
educational technologyt1 is allowed t o  t ransfer  ,freely t o  a l l  countries. "Indus- 
t r i a l  data" i s  generally allowed t o  move t o  the non-co~mnunist "free world" on the 
theory that  the U.S. i s  advantaged by t h i s  flow of technology to  our a l l i e s ;  the 
same technology however, when exported t o  communist countries,  i s  very t i gh t ly  
controlled. In granting special l icenses,  several factors ara considered: (1) thc 
s t r a t eg i c  or military impact of the product, ( 2 )  the end user, (3) the end use (and 
whether the computer system a t  issue i s  appropriately scaled t o  t h i s  use),  and (4)  
the r i sk  of diversion of the export t o  other users. The U.S. cooperates i n  t h i s  
program of export control with i t s  13 NATO a l l i e s  and Japan in a group called the 
Coordinating Committee (COCOM), which maintains an International Commodity List  of 
items which are banned from export t o  socia l  t countries.  
In par t icular ly  d i f f i c u l t  o r  disputed applications fo r  computer export l icenses,  
the Commerce Department w i l l  establish a task force with other qgencies to  examine 
c r i t i c a l  factors;  they often draw upon the In s t i t u t e  for  Computer Sciences and Tech- 
nology a t  the National Bureau of Standards, which Dswney described as  a "highly re-  
spected, talented group." In addition, the Department has organized several tech- 
n ica l  advisory c m i t t e e s  i n  areas such as computers and computer peripherals,  t o  
a s s i s t  it in  arriving a t  the U.S. position on export controls i n  the national and 
international contexts. 
Downey noted as par t icular ly  d i f f i cu l t  problems (1) assessing the r i sks  in allowing 
export of training and software associated with computer sa les ,  and (2 )  assessing 
the appropriateness of systems fo r  par t icular  applications. 
While describing the present system as a workable one, Downey acknowledged the com- 
peting pressures from industry t o  re lax  export controls to  a more "rea l is t ic"  level,  
and from Congress, which i s  generally not sympathetic t o  decontrol of high technol- 
ogy exports. 
RESEARCH AND DEVEWPMENT IN INFORMATION PROCESSING. The research and development 
(RED) area was addressed i n  preseqtations from the two largest funding organizations 
of computer R&D i n  t he  Federal government, the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
which has a proposed budget of $15.8 million i n  f i s c a l  year 1977 (FY 77) and the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which has a proposed FY 77 budget 
6f $37.7 million. 
NSF. Dr. John Pasta, Director of the Division of Mathematical and Computer Sciences 
i n  NSF, described the agency's computer science budget fo r  FY 77 i n  the con tex t a f  
the  overall  RED budget proposed by President Ford (similar figures have been de- 
scribed i n  the February Washington Retort) Pasta noted that  overall  R&D has de- 
clined about 30% ( in  1967 dollars) from 1967 t o  1975, but tha t  research alone had 
remained about constant. In the proposed FY 77 budget, however, computer research 
funding i s  up 26% over FY 76 [an increase on the order of 15% over FY 76, even con- 
sidering inflation].  
Pasta pointed out that NSF 'and AKPA wi l l  remain, under the proposed FY 77 budget, 
the primary contributors of Federal support for research i n  computer science a t  
universit ies and colleges. The speci f ic  amounts are ( in  $ millions):

ARPA. Col. David Russell, Director of the Information Processing Techniques Office 
(IPTO) in  the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) outlined 
the general operations and specific program of h is  of f ice .  He describes the charter 
of ARPA to  be working a t  the forefront of emerging technology, and he emphasized 
that ARPA is involved only in basic and exploratory research oriented toward the 
missions of the Department of Defense. ARPA endeavors t o  avoid research areas being 
addressed by industry, and w i l l  withdraw from a research area i f  it appears tha t  the 
problem w i l l  bd solved through indust r ia l  research. 
Russell gave the following outline for proposed I P M  research in FY 77 (the initial 
numbers correspond to standard Department of Defense research categories and the 
italicized categories are explained in greater detail below): 
6.1  Bash research i n  computer and comnicat ions  sciences ($17.2 million) 
6.2 Exploratory development 
- Distributed .inforrmtiot~ systems ($11.0 million) 
- Integmted c o m n d  and control, and oommunicntiom systems ( $ 9 . 5  million) 
Basic research i n  computer and c o m i c a t i o n s  sciences ($17.2 million). IPlU under- 
takes research in three areas: 
Imge understanding ($3.0 million). IPTO is departing from trnditional numer- 
ical processing of images, and moving into symbolic processing techniques 
adopted from the field of artificialintelligence. 
InteZZigent systems ($8 .4  million). ARPA will continue its long-standing 
effort in this area (it has funded approximately 75% of all artificial in- 
telligence research). The agency will focus on three areas: (1) "basic" 
artificial intelligence, including problem solving, natural language pro- 
cessing and general reasoning, (2) command and control applications, e.g., 
a natural language frontend processor, and an intelligent distributed data 
base system, ,and (3) the use of intelligent terminals to help solve the 
manlmachine interface problem. 
Advquced memory technology ( $ 4 . 8  million). This is a new effort for ARPA 
beginning in P 76, co isting of a study of hardware available to support 
very large (13' to lo9' bits) memories in the 1990ts, such as archival 
beam memories, and a related study of artificial intelligence techniques use- 
ful in manipulating very large data bases, such as inference and text sum- 
marizing. 
Distributed in formtion systems ($11.0 million). 
S o f w r e  technology ($5.0 million). This research wiLl emphasize the in- 
creasing expense, and increasing reliability problems oE software. 
Speech processing ($4.1 million). This research represents the last year 
of ARPA's five.year program in computer understanding of continuous speech 
(presently feasible only at 100 times real time) and packet speech trans- 
mission (which would enable the ARPANET, for example, to transmit both. 
speech and digital information). 
Netuork and system security ($1.1 million). This work will address the 
problems inherent in the military multilevel classification systems, both 
from a design and certification standpoint. 
Integrated connnand and control, and conminicatdons systems ($9 .5  million). Russell 
cited two examples of programs: 
Packet radio. A distributed net of miniprocessors connected by radio 
l inks  capable of transmitting data  a t  r a t e s  from 100 t o  400 Kb/sec. 
will  be investigated. 
Internett ing s tudies .  This program w i l l  focus on how t o  connect dip- 
ferent  networks through various gateway schcmes and internetwork proto- 
cols ,  as well a$ how t o  in tegra te  wire,  radio  and s a t e l l i t e  packet net- 
works. 
AFIPS COMMFNTS. AFIPS President Anthony Ralston closed the discussion by ca l l ing  
on AFIPS and i t s  constituent socie t ies  t o  continue the dialogue undertaken i n  the 
briefing. This dialogue consis ts ,  he noted, not only of  obtaining and disseminat- 
ing information about Washington, but a l so  o l  the important task of providing tcch- 
nological input to  tho Federal government whore needed.

EPTS COMMISSION HOLDS INITIAL MEETING 
The EFTS Commission held its first meeting in Washington on February 6. While the 
Commission agreed that its primary concern would be "the broad public policy issues 
of EFTS" (in contrast to technical issues) the majority of the meeting was devoted 
to organizational matters. The most substantive aspect of the meeting was a dis- 
cussion of the proposed amendments to Federal Reserve Regulation J, which would de- 
fine the duties and liabilities of participants in the Federal Reserve's wire trans- 
fer and automated payment services, and the proposed rules for access to the Federal 
Reserve's electronic clearing, settlement and delivery services (automrlted clearing- 
houses). Both the Regulation J amendments and the interim guidelines for access [ X I  
are subject to public comment until March 19. The Comission debated whether it 
should devote its resources to such interim comments on immediate issues, or whether 
it should work primarily toward a comprehensive report; agreement could not be 
reached and the matter was postponed for further discussion at the next Commission 
meeting (scheduled for March 12). 
The Commission indicated it would fully exploit existing EFTS research (Chairman 
Widnall noted in particular the Arthur D. Little study funded by the National Science 
Foundation, "The Consequences of Electronic Funds Transfer"). The Commission staff 
has been directed to prepare a summary of the current status of EFTS within 60 days; 
the report is to "bring together the results from early research, both quantitative 
and qualitative, and to provide beginnings of a data base for the Commission's in- 
quiry". Preparation of the report will draw upon government resources as well as 
independunt organizations puch as A F I P ~  .
Single copies of the A r t h  D. Little study may be obtained by writing to: NSF/RANN 
Document Center, Room 1241; 1800 G Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. 20550. 
PRIVACY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ON TAX RETURN CONFIDENTIALITY 
The Privacy Comission will meet in Washington on March 11 and 12, primarily ro dis- 
cuss the Commission's proposed recommendations on Federal tax return confidentiality. 
The Commission published the draft reconunendations on February 13, allowing only ten 
working days for written public comment. The recommendations (#) would amend the 
Internal Revenue Code to provide that the Internal Revenue Service may disclose re- 
turns to Federal and state agencies only with prior written consent to the taxpayer, 
except for disclosures to the Bureau of the Census for statistical purposes, to 
state tax agencies (under certain restrictive conditions), to the Department of 
Justice (in some cases without a warrant), and to the Department of Health, Education 
and Welfare for use in certain welfare programs. 
NEWS BRIEFS 
Both the Commerce Department (Deputy Assistant Secretary Arthur Downey) and the 
Computer and Bus5ness Equipment Manufacturers Assqciation differ with Sen. 
Byrd's statement (Washington Report, 2/76) that $500 million worth of computer 
equipment w&s exported to the Soviet Union last year; Commerce estimates the 
figure to be about $5 million, while CBEMA puts it at $3.5 million.
