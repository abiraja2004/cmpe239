Abstract
In this paper, we examine how to im-
prove the precision and recall of docu-
ment clustering by utilizing meta-data.
We use meta-data through NewsML tags 
to assist clustering and show that this ap-
proach is effective through experiments 
on sample news data. Experimental result 
shows that clustering using NewsML 
could improve average recall and preci-
sion over the same without using
NewsML by about 10%. Our algorithm 
facilitates effective e-business for the
news media and publishing industry to
empower e-business.

Introduction
Nowadays, people have great demand on
knowledge and information, while information
overload becoming one serious problem. News
media and publishing industry therefore try to suit 
customers? need by using electronic information
management system. Document clustering algo-
rithm has been introduced to group similar docu-
ments together for easier searching and reading.
Document clustering algorithm has been 
widely used in news media and publishing indus-
try, which ensured it effectiveness over manual 
clustering. With labor cost reduced and time saved,
document clustering algorithm provides conven-
ient clustered-news for users. 
To improve the accuracy of document
clustering algorithm, we suggest to provide more
flexible information for each document. Under the
hypothesis that document clustering algorithm can
get better result with more information about data 
used, we suggest that using additional meta-data 
contained in NewsML standard could enhance the 
performance of document clustering algorithms.
We evaluated the effectiveness of using 
meta-data in the proposed clustering algorithm.
We used Chinese electronic news sources for the
evaluation. The experiment showed that using the
meta-data provided by NewsML achieved better 
document clustering.
The remaining of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: In Section 2, we give an overview of current 
document clustering approaches. Section 3, analy-
ses existing problems in document clustering and 
suggests a solution using NewsML. We show the
tags that could be used in the algorithm and how 
they are handled. The performance of algorithm
through experiments, and we will present the ex-
perimental results regarding measures in precision 
and recall. In Section 5, we include a brief sum-
mary and discussion on future work.
Current Approaches
Different document clustering methods have 
been examined. These conventional clustering
methods mainly consist of two parts: construction 
of a similarity matrix between documents and
formulation of clustering algorithm to generate 
clusters.
Similarity Matrix 
The first step of conventional clustering
method is to construct a similarity matrix between
these documents so as to understand how docu-
ments are similar to one another. The constructed
similarity matrix will later be used by the cluster-
ing algorithm for generating clusters.

Named entity method (Volk and Clematide, 
2001) is one of the widely used approaches for 
constructing a similarity matrix. Named Entities 
form the major components in a document. When 
fundamental entities like Person, Company and 
Geographical names are detected, the algorithm 
could understand the content of a document to a 
certain extent. 
Named entity method has also been investi-
gated together with keywords to perform cluster-
ing  (Lam, Meng, Wong and Yen, 2001). The 
similarity score is calculated based on the named 
entity vectors and the keyword vector with 
weighting parameters to control the degree of em-
phasis on the corresponding vectors. 
Concept terms method (Wong, Lam and Yen, 
1999) has been proposed in order to deal with the 
problem of vocabulary switching. The potentially 
concept terms are basically the keywords derived 
from a separated concept generation corpus. Con-
cept terms are selected based on the co-occurrence 
between a query and a document. 
However, named entities approach and con-
cept terms approach contain some limitations: The 
accuracy of the clustering algorithm would be di-
rectly proportional to the accuracy of algorithm. 
Thus, any error from identifications of named en-
tities or concept terms will adversely affect the 
quality of the clustering algorithm as well. 
N-gram Algorithm (Lee, Cho and Park, 1999) 
has been introduced in order to avoid the afore-
mentioned limitations. An N-gram is a character 
sequence of length N extracted from a document. 
The main idea of the N-gram approach is that the 
character structure of a term can be used to find 
semantically similar terms. The approach assumes 
no prior linguistic knowledge about the text being 
processed. Moreover, there is no language-
specific information used in the N-grams ap-
proach, which qualifies this method as a language-
independent approach. By using N-grams, fre-
quently appeared terms of each document can be 
extracted and compared to make the similarity 
measure. 
2.2 Clustering Algorithm 
Probabilistic method is one of the com-
monly used methods in document clustering. The 
aim of probabilistic method is to minimize the 
heterogeneity in each group with respect to the 
group representative based on statistical ap-
proaches (Estivill-Castro and Yang, 2001). Neural 
network is also used to perform a cyclic learning 
process for clustering (Grothkopf, Andernach and 
Stevens-Rayburn, 1998).  
Hierarchical clustering methods include 
group-average clustering algorithm and single-
link clustering algorithm (Johnson and Kargupta, 
2000; Tombros, Villa and Van Rijsbergen, 2002). 
Group average clustering is based on creating a 
hierarchical tree by initially creating a singleton 
cluster for each document. The clusters are 
merged to the parent node until the algorithm goal 
is achieved. The algorithm merges document pairs 
in the resulting clusters by merging clusters in a 
greedy, bottom-up fashion. A divide-and-conquer 
strategy can be used to balance the cluster quality 
and computational efficiency. 
The basic steps of group-average clustering 
algorithm are like this: On each iteration, it first 
divides the current pool of clusters into evenly 
sized buckets. Group-average clustering is then 
applied to each bucket locally, merging smaller 
clusters into larger ones. The time complexity for 
the algorithm is O(kn), where k is bucket size and 
n is the number of documents. 
Single link clustering (Dunlop, 2000), on the 
other hand, is based on creating a hierarchical tree 
by continually inserting an additional node that 
satisfies the following criteria: 
- The new node is currently outside the hierar-
chy 
- Of all similarities between nodes inside and 
outside the hierarchy, the new node which has 
the strongest similarity is selected. It is then 
added to the hierarchy at a level based on how 
strong the similarity is. 
The approach is fairly fast and result in hier-
archies where the closest nearest neighbours are at 
lower levels of the hierarchy. However, it leads to 
non-balanced clusters, and many node-node com-
parisons can have the same strength of similarity 
thus many documents can be linked at the same 
level in the hierarchy. 
The accuracy of the above conventional clus-
tering method, however, is generally low. There-
fore a new approach is proposed. 
3 Our Proposed Method 
In our proposal, we suggest the following ap-
proaches for generating clusters. 
1. Use Bi-gram to extract terms from
documents
2. Use <KeywordLine> Tag to look up
keyword terms for documents
3. Compare terms betweens documents to
construct similarity matrix
4. Use <SubjectCode> Tag to group docu-
ments to different subjects 
5. Adjust similarity matrix by data pro-
vided by step 4
6. Apply group-average clustering algo-
rithm to generate clusters 
We have chosen to use Bi-gram algorithm to
extract terms from documents. The idea of bi-
gram Algorithm is similar to N-grams?. The rea-
son of using bi-gram instead of N-gram is that our
experiment mainly deals with Chinese (Big5)
news. Since Chinese terms are typically formed
by two Chinese characters, bi-gram approach is 
sufficient for this application. Using bi-gram,
moreover, would be a more effective approach 
when handling other two-byte code like Japanese 
and Korean languages (Lee, Cho and Park, 1999).
Using bi-grams instead of N-grams can re-
duce system resources. Since hundreds of docu-
ments are handled each time, using N-gram would 
be impractical. For instance, using N-grams ap-
proach for a document with M Chinese characters
would extract (M-1) + (M-2)+?+[M- (N-1)]
terms. This would require more time for compari-
son than only M-1 terms for bi-grams. 
Figure 1: A sample document in NewsML format containing keywords and subject labels
We suggest using NewsML 
(http://www.newsml.org) in our project. NewsML,
which is released by International Press and Tele-
communications Council (IPTC) (www.iptc.org ),
is an XML-based data format for news that is in-
tended to use for the creation, transfer and deliv-
ery of news. All news is created based on 
NewsML data type definition (DTD) file. 
NewsML has been widely recognized globally.
Noticeable users include Reuters, AFP, and Kyo-
donews.
A sample document in NewsML format is 
shown in Figure 1. By using NewsML, a helpful 
tag called <KeywordLine> can be used in order to
look up existing keywords from a document. The 
keywords, which could highly reflect the main
concept of the document, would usually be given
by the author of the document and stored in the 
<KeywordLine> tag under NewsML. Thus, the 
<KeywordLine> Tag is a useful indicator for
keyword extraction.
We used NewsML tagged keywords for 
comparison. A score is computed for each key-
word based on term frequency to reflect the level 
of importance to the document. A given keyword,
however, may exist in more than two Chinese 
characters. But in order to make easy and accurate
comparison, we extracted the keywords in two 
Chinese characters each and compare them with 
the terms extracted by the bi-gram algorithm.
These keywords would be more representative
than those extracted by bi-gram. Thus, they would 
be very useful for identifying the news content. 
We therefore applied higher weighting to these 
terms. In view of this, we assign the weighting of 
NewsML tagged keywords ten times more than
those extracted using bi-grams.
Besides using only the keywords and terms 
from a news document, subject of the news is also
crucial. For example, news referring to entertain-
ment should not be in the same cluster with one 
talking about business news. Understanding news
semantically to a certain extent can help improve
clustering accuracy. <SubjectCode> Tag in 
NewsML enabled the clustering algorithm to dis-
tinguish which subject a particular news is refer-
ring to. Although the <SubjectCode> only gives a 
rough concept of the news, it can significantly
improve accuracy.
In our experiment, we ensured that news with
different <SubjectCode> would not be put in the 
same cluster. The similarity measure of two pieces
of news with different <SubjectCode> would, 
therefore, be zero. 
4 Experimental Results
We assessed the effectiveness of using meta-
data for document clustering empirically. We used 
NewsML meta-data and Hong Kong Chinese
news articles for this purpose. 
Performance metrics are based on Recall and 
Precision, which are defined as follows: 
In event Not in event 
In cluster A B
Not in cluster C D
Recall = A / (A+C) if A+C > 0 
Precision = A / (A+B) if A+B > 0 
To study the effect of NewsML, we calcu-
lated the percentage of recall and precision under
different threshold values. The threshold value (0-
1) is a user-defined variable for clustering. The 
threshold is the value where documents within a 
cluster should have a similarity greater than it, and 
similarity between two documents is calculated by
Jaccard?s coefficient: 
cba
a
www
w

where
a is the set of terms present in both docu-
ments
b is the set of terms present in document 1 
but absent in document 2 
c is the set of terms present in document 2 
but absent in document 1 
cba www ,,  are the sum of weights of the
related set. 
A higher threshold represent higher similarity
is needed for documents to be put in the same
cluster.
Prior to the experiment, we matched each
piece of news with specific Subject Codes defined
by IPTC (http://www.iptc.org/site/subject-
codes/index.html), as well as adding keywords
with respect to their contents. After the prepara-
tion process, we started our experiment and find 
out the recall and precision measures as above 
stated
The main difference between the algorithms
with and without NewsML is on the use of the 
KeywordLine and SubjectCode tags. The evalua-
tion steps are as follows: 
1. Non-overlapping clusters are generated by
our clustering system
2. Each generated cluster is matched to the most
similar sample event using a one-to-one 
matching method.
3. If the number of clusters generated is less 
than the number of events in the data set, dis-
card the excessive sample events after match-
ing.
4. If the number of clusters generated is greater 
than the number of events in the data set, 
empty events are added to the sample and
they are matched with the generated clusters. 
5. Calculate recall and precision for each cluster 
pairs
6. Use the calculated recall and precision, to
obtain the macro-average (Yang, Pierce and
Carbonell, 1998).
7. Repeat the above steps on different threshold 
values.

Figure 2: Clustering evaluation result for 158 news articles from three different publications
4.1 4.2Experiment A: News Articles from Mul-
tiple Publications
We began our evaluation with a set of data 
from three different publications. We used 158
news articles containing 31 distinct events (which
was equivalent to 31 non-overlapping clusters) as 
our training set. The events belonged to different 
sector including local news, international news,
sports news, entertainment news and business 
news. Based on the IPTC Subject Reference Sys-
tem (www.iptc.org), these news articles were clas-
sified into 7 different subjects. 
The result is shown in Figure 2 where x-axis 
represents the threshold and y-axis represents the
percentage of the measure.
The graph suggests that both recall and preci-
sion values decrease with increasing threshold. 
The performance of using NewsML is better when
the threshold is smaller. The greatest difference
occurs when threshold value = 0.2 
Moreover, we observe that the variation of 
the performance is greater when using NewsML.
The precision and recall can drop about 40% by
changing the threshold. In the contrast, without 
using NewsML, the result is more steady. 
On average, recall and precision NewsML-
based algorithm gives 16.15% and 12.09% respec-
tively improvement of its non-NewsML counter-
part.
Experiment B: News Articles from the
Same Publication 
We then carried out another experiment us-
ing 503 news articles from one single publication.
We tried to classify these news articles manually
to events of related news, and then carried out the 
same approach as the first experiment. These 503 
news articles contained 126 distinct events and 
classified to 12 different subjects with reference to
the IPTC Subject Reference System.
We find out how the system performs when
dealing with one single publication. As we predict, 
news from only one single publication often uses 
same keywords or terms to express the same con-
cept. This simplified clustering. 
The result is shown in Figure 3 where x-axis 
represents the threshold and y-axis represents the
percentage of the measure.
The performance of the system decrease
when the threshold value increases, which is con-
sistent with the first experiment. From the graph, 
we observe that the performance is best when the
threshold is between 0.2 and 0.4, which means
those values could best match human expectation.
The graph also suggests that both recall and 
precision gives a better result towards using meta-
data. On average 8.02% (recall) and 8.92% (preci-
sion) improvement over the approach without us-
ing NewsML meta-data are achieved.

5 Conclusions 
From the results of the two experiments, we 
have found that using NewsML could improve
both the recall and precision of the document clus-
tering algorithm by about 10%, over those without 
using NewsML.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the effec-
tiveness of document clustering algorithm could
be improved by utilizing meta-data in additional 
to the original data content. In our experiment, we 
chose NewsML as a representation of news con-
tent with added meta-data. We proposed to use the 
<KeywordLine> tags and <SubjectCode> tags in
NewsML for clustering.
Our proposed document clustering algorithm
is a refinement of conventional group-average
clustering algorithm and bi-gram algorithm. It has 
been shown that NewsML could help conven-
tional clustering methods improve both the recall
and precision by about 10% on average.
In order to demonstrate the practicality of
NewsML for e-business, we have deployed
NewsML in developing an application called
NewsFocus1. News Focus consists of a clustering 
function. The function is mainly for clustering
similar news from three different news sources in
Hong Kong. News articles under NewsFocus are 
clustered by news events. 
In the future, we try to use different methods
to further improve the clustering performance. 
Inverted document frequency and cosine-angle
formula, for example, have been widely used in 
terms score calculation and matrix similarity cal-
culation. Top relevance terms can be used as key-
words in case of any insufficiency of metadata.
We will also try to use other tags in NewsML like 
<Headline> in supplement with <KeywordLine> 
and <SubjectCode> to give more metadata infor-
mation for the document. Weighting parameters
may also be applied to show the degree of empha-
sis on using those metadata.
