Abstract
We present a new and unique para-
phrase resource, which contains meaning-
preserving transformations between infor-
mal user-generated text. Sentential para-
phrases are extracted from a compara-
ble corpus of temporally and topically
related messages on Twitter which of-
ten express semantically identical infor-
mation through distinct surface forms. We
demonstrate the utility of this new re-
source on the task of paraphrasing and
normalizing noisy text, showing improve-
ment over several state-of-the-art para-
phrase and normalization systems 1.
1 Introduction
Social media services provide a massive amount
of valuable information and demand NLP tools
specifically developed to accommodate their noisy
style. So far not much success has been reported
on a key NLP technology on social media data:
paraphrasing. Paraphrases are alternative ways to
express the same meaning in the same language
and commonly employed to improve the perfor-
mance of many other NLP applications (Madnani
and Dorr, 2010). In the case of Twitter, Petrovic? et
al. (2012) showed improvements on first story de-
tection by using paraphrases extracted from Word-
Net.
Learning paraphrases from tweets could be es-
pecially beneficial. First, the high level of in-
formation redundancy in Twitter provides a good
opportunity to collect many different expressions.
Second, tweets contain many kinds of paraphrases
not available elsewhere including typos, abbre-
viations, ungrammatical expressions and slang,

which can be particularly valuable for many appli-
cations, such as phrase-based text normalization
(Kaufmann and Kalita, 2010) and correction of
writing mistakes (Gamon et al, 2008), given the
difficulty of acquiring annotated data. Paraphrase
models that are derived from microblog data could
be useful to improve other NLP tasks on noisy
user-generated text and help users to interpret a
large range of up-to-date abbreviations (e.g. dlt ?
Doritos Locos Taco) and native expressions (e.g.
oh my god ? {oh my goodness | oh my gosh | oh
my gawd | oh my jesus}) etc.
This paper presents the first investigation into
automatically collecting a large paraphrase cor-
pus of tweets, which can be used for building
paraphrase systems adapted to Twitter using tech-
niques from statistical machine translation (SMT).
We show experimental results demonstrating the
benefits of an in-domain parallel corpus when
paraphrasing tweets. In addition, our paraphrase
models can be applied to the task of normalizing
noisy text where we show improvements over the
state-of-the-art.
Relevant previous work has extracted sentence-
level paraphrases from news corpora (Dolan et
al., 2004; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al,
2004). Paraphrases gathered from noisy user-
generated text on Twitter have unique character-
istics which make this comparable corpus a valu-
able new resource for mining sentence-level para-
phrases. Twitter also has much less context than
news articles and much more diverse content, thus
posing new challenges to control the noise in min-
ing paraphrases while retaining the desired super-
ficial dissimilarity.
2 Related Work
There are several key strands of related work, in-
cluding previous work on gathering parallel mono-
lingual text from topically clustered news articles,
normalizing noisy Twitter text using word-based
121
models, and applying out-of-domain paraphrase
systems to improve NLP tasks in Twitter.
On the observation of the lack of a large para-
phrase corpus, Chen and Dolan (2011) have re-
sorted to crowdsourcing to collect paraphrases by
asking multiple independent users for descriptions
of the same short video. As we show in ?5, how-
ever, this data is very different from Twitter, so
paraphrase systems trained on in-domain Twitter
paraphrases tend to perform much better.
The task of paraphrasing tweets is also related
to previous work on normalizing noisy Twitter text
(Han and Baldwin, 2011; Han et al, 2012; Liu
et al, 2012). Most previous work on normaliza-
tion has applied word-based models. While there
are challenges in applying Twitter paraphrase sys-
tems to the task of normalization, access to paral-
lel text allows us to make phrase-based transfor-
mations to the input string rather than relying on
word-to-word mappings (for more details see ?4).
Also relevant is recent work on collecting bilin-
gual parallel data from Twitter (Jehl et al, 2012;
Ling et al, 2013). In contrast, we focus on mono-
lingual paraphrases rather than multilingual trans-
lations.
Finally we highlight recent work on apply-
ing out-of-domain paraphrase systems to improve
performance at first story detection in Twitter
(Petrovic? et al, 2012). By building better para-
phrase models adapted to Twitter, it should be pos-
sible to improve performance at such tasks, which
benefit from paraphrasing Tweets.
3 Gathering A Parallel Tweet Corpus
There is a huge amount of redundant information
on Twitter. When significant events take place in
the world, many people go to Twitter to share,
comment and discuss them. Among tweets on
the same topic, many will convey similar mean-
ing using widely divergent expressions. Whereas
researchers have exploited multiple news reports
about the same event for paraphrase acquisition
(Dolan et al, 2004), Twitter contains more vari-
ety in terms of both language forms and types of
events, and requires different treatment due to its
unique characteristics.
As described in ?3.1, our approach first identi-
fies tweets which refer to the same popular event
as those which mention a unique named entity and
date, then aligns tweets within each event to con-
struct a parallel corpus. To generate paraphrases,
we apply a typical phrase-based statistical MT
pipeline, performing word alignment on the paral-
lel data using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), then
extracting phrase pairs and performing decoding
uses Moses (Koehn et al, 2007).
3.1 Extracting Events from Tweets
As a first step towards extracting paraphrases from
popular events discussed on Twitter, we need a
way to identify Tweets which mention the same
event. To do this we follow previous work by Rit-
ter et al (2012), extracting named entities and
resolving temporal expressions (for example ?to-
morrow? or ?on Wednesday?). Because tweets are
compact and self-contained, those which mention
the same named entity and date are likely to refer-
ence the same event. We also employ a statistical
significance test to measure strength of association
between each named entity and date, and thereby
identify important events discussed widely among
users with a specific focus, such as the release of
a new iPhone as opposed to individual users dis-
cussing everyday events involving their phones.
By gathering tweets based on popular real-world
events, we can efficiently extract pairwise para-
phrases within a small group of closely related
tweets, rather than exploring every pair of tweets
in a large corpus. By discarding frequent but in-
significant events, such as ?I like my iPhone? and
?I like broke my iPhone?, we can reduce noise
and encourage diversity of paraphrases by requir-
ing less lexical overlap. Example events identified
using this procedure are presented in Table 1.
3.2 Extracting Paraphrases Within Events
Twitter users are likely to express the same mean-
ing in relation to an important event, however not
every pair of tweets mentioning the same event
will have the same meaning. People may have
opposite opinions and complicated events such as
presidential elections can have many aspects. To
build a useful monolingual paraphrase corpus, we
need some additional filtering to prevent unrelated
sentence pairs.
If two tweets mention the same event and also
share many words in common, they are very likely
to be paraphrases. We use the Jaccard distance
metric (Jaccard, 1912) to identify pairs of sen-
tences within an event that are similar at the lexical
level. Since tweets are extremely short with little
context and include a broad range of topics, using
only surface similarity is prone to unrelated sen-

tence pairs. The average sentence length is only
11.9 words in our Twitter corpus, compared to
18.6 words in newswire (Dolan et al, 2004) which
also contains additional document-level informa-
tion. Even after filtering tweets with both their
event cluster and lexical overlap, some unrelated
sentence pairs remain in the parallel corpus. For
example, names of two separate music venues in
the same city might be mismatched together if they
happen to have concerts on the same night that
people tweeted using a canonical phrasing like ?I
am going to a concert at in Austin tonight?.
4 Paraphrasing Tweets for
Normalization
Paraphrase models built from grammatical text are
not appropriate for the task of normalizing noisy
text. However, the unique characteristics of the
Twitter data allow our paraphrase models to in-
clude both normal and noisy language and conse-
quently translate between them. Our models have
a tendency to normalize because correct spellings
and grammar are most frequently used,2 but there
is still danger of introducing noise. For the pur-
poses of normalization, we therefore biased our
models using a language model built using text
taken from the New York Times which is used to
represent grammatical English.
Previous work on microblog normalization is
mostly limited to word-level adaptation or out-of-
domain annotated data. Our phrase-based mod-
els fill the gap left by previous studies by exploit-
ing a large, automatically curated, in-domain para-
phrase corpus.
Lexical normalization (Han and Baldwin, 2011)
only considers transforming an out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) word to its standard form, i.e. in-
vocabulary (IV) word. Beyond word-to-word con-
versions, our phrase-based model is also able to
handle the following types of errors without re-
quiring any annotated data:
Error type Ill form Standard

1-to-many everytime every time
incorrect IVs can?t want

Kaufmann and Kalita (2010) explored machine
translation techniques for the normalization task
using an SMS corpus which was manually anno-
tated with grammatical paraphrases. Microblogs,
however, contain a much broader range of content
than SMS and have no in-domain annotated data
available. In addition, the ability to gather para-
phrases automatically opens up the possibility to
build normalization models from orders of mag-
nitude more data, and also to produce up-to-date
normalization models which capture new abbrevi-
ations and slang as they are invented.
5 Experiments
We evaluate our system and several baselines
at the task of paraphrasing Tweets using pre-
viously developed automatic evaluation metrics
which have been shown to have high correlation
with human judgments (Chen and Dolan, 2011).
2Even though misspellings and grammatical errors are
quite common, there is much more variety and less agree-
ment.
123
In addition, because no previous work has evalu-
ated these metrics in the context of noisy Twitter
data, we perform a human evaluation in which an-
notators are asked to choose which system gen-
erates the best paraphrase. Finally we evaluate
our phrase-based normalization system against a
state-of-the-art word-based normalizer developed
for Twitter (Han et al, 2012).
5.1 Paraphrasing Tweets
5.1.1 Data
Our paraphrase dataset is distilled from a large
corpus of tweets gathered over a one-year period
spanning November 2011 to October 2012 using
the Twitter Streaming API. Following Ritter et
al. (2012), we grouped together all tweets which
mention the same named entity (recognized using
a Twitter specific name entity tagger3) and a ref-
erence to the same unique calendar date (resolved
using a temporal expression processor (Mani and
Wilson, 2000)). Then we applied a statistical sig-
nificance test (the G test) to rank the events, which
considers the corpus frequency of the named en-
tity, the number of times the date has been men-
tioned, and the number of tweets which mention
both together. Altogether we collected more than
3 million tweets from the 50 top events of each day
according to the p-value from the statistical test,
with an average of 229 tweets per event cluster.
Each of these tweets was passed through a Twit-
ter tokenizer4 and a simple sentence splitter, which
also removes emoticons, URLs and most of the
hashtags and usernames. Hashtags and usernames
that were in the middle of sentences and might
be part of the text were kept. Within each event
cluster, redundant and short sentences (less than 3
words) were filtered out, and the remaining sen-
tences were paired together if their Jaccard simi-
larity was no less than 0.5. This resulted in a par-
allel corpus consisting of 4,008,946 sentence pairs
with 800,728 unique sentences.
We then trained paraphrase models by applying
a typical phrase-based statistical MT pipeline on
the parallel data, which uses GIZA++ for word
alignment and Moses for extracting phrase pairs,
training and decoding. We use a language model
trained on the 3 million collected tweets in the de-
coding process. The parameters are tuned over de-

tweetmotif
velopment data and the exact configuration are re-
leased together with the phrase table for system
replication.
Sentence alignment in comparable corpora is
more difficult than between direct translations
(Moore, 2002), and Twitter?s noisy style, short
context and broad range of content present ad-
ditional complications. Our automatically con-
structed parallel corpus contains some proportion
of unrelated sentence pairs and therefore does re-
sult in some unreasonable paraphrases. We prune
out unlikely phrase pairs using a technique pro-
posed by Johnson et al (2007) with their recom-
mended setting, which is based on the significance
testing of phrase pair co-occurrence in the parallel
corpus (Moore, 2004). We further prevent unrea-
sonable translations by adding additional entries
to the phrase table to ensure every phrase has an
option to remain unchanged during paraphrasing
and normalization. Without these noise reduction
steps, our system will produce paraphrases with
serious errors (e.g. change a person?s last name)
for 100 out of 200 test tweets in the evaluation in
?5.1.5.
At the same time, it is also important to promote
lexical dissimilarity in the paraphrase task. Fol-
lowing Ritter et. al. (2011) we add a lexical sim-
ilarity penalty to each phrase pair in our system,
in addition to the four basic components (transla-
tion model, distortion model, language model and
word penalty) in SMT.
5.1.2 Evaluation Details
The beauty of lexical similarity penalty is that it
gives control over the degree of paraphrasing by
adjusting its weight versus the other components.
Thus we can plot a BLEU-PINC curve to express
the tradeoff between semantic adequacy and lexi-
cal dissimilarity with the input, where BLUE (Pa-
pineni et al, 2002) and PINC (Chen and Dolan,
2011) are previously proposed automatic evalua-
tion metrics to measure respectively the two crite-
ria of paraphrase quality.
To compute these automatic evaluation met-
rics, we manually prepared a dataset of gold para-
phrases by tracking the trending topics on Twitter5
and gathering groups of paraphrases in November
2012. In total 20 sets of sentences were collected
and each set contains 5 different sentences that ex-
press the same meaning. Each sentence is used

5.1.3 Baselines
We consider two state-of-the-art paraphrase sys-
tems as baselines, both of which are trained on
parallel corpora of aligned sentences. The first one
is trained on a large-scale corpus gathered by ask-
ing users of Amazon?s Mechanical Turk Service
(Snow et al, 2008) to write a one-sentence de-
scription of a short video clip (Chen and Dolan,
2011). We combined a phrase table and distor-
tion table extracted from this parallel corpus with
the same Twitter language model, applying the
Moses decoder to generate paraphrases. The ad-
ditional noise removal steps described in ?5.1.1
were found helpful for this model during devel-
opment and were therefore applied. The second
baseline uses the Microsoft Research paraphrase
tables that are automatically extracted from news
articles in combination with the Twitter language
model.6
5.1.4 Results
Figure 1 compares our system against both base-
lines, varying the lexical similarity penalty for
each system to generate BLEU-PINC curves.
Our system trained on automatically gathered
in-domain Twitter paraphrases achieves higher
BLEU at equivalent PINC for the entire length of
the curves. Table 2 shows some sample outputs of
our system on real Twitter data.
One novel feature of our approach, compared
to previous work on paraphrasing, is that it cap-
tures many slang terms, acronyms, abbreviations
and misspellings that are otherwise hard to learn.
6No distortion table or noisy removal process is applied
because the parallel corpus is not available.

Several examples are shown in table 3. The rich
semantic redundancy in Twitter helps generate a
large variety of typical paraphrases as well (see an
example in table 4).
5.1.5 Human Evaluation
In addition to automatic evaluation, we also per-
formed a human evaluation in which annotators
were asked to pick which system generated the
best paraphrase. We used the same dataset of
200 tweets gathered for the automatic evaluation
and generated paraphrases using the 3 systems in
Figure 1 with the highest BLEU which achieve a
PINC of at least 40. The human annotators were
then asked to pick which of the 3 systems gener-
ated the best paraphrase using the criteria that it
should be both different from the original and also

capture as much of the original meaning as pos-

picking one as the best in cases where there were

paraphrases totally lost the meaning.
Figure 2 displays the number of times each an-
notator picked each system?s output as the best.
Annotator 2 was somewhat more conservative
than annotator 1, choosing to abstain more fre-
quently and leading to lower overall frequencies,
however in both cases we see a clear advantage
from paraphrasing using in-domain models. As
a measure of inter-rater agreement, we computed
Cohen?s Kappa between the annotators judgment
as to whether the Twitter-trained system?s output
best. The value of Cohen?s Kappa in this case was
0.525.
5.2 Phrase-Based Normalization
Because Twitter contains both normal and noisy
language, with appropriate tuning, our models
have the capability to translate between these two
styles, e.g. paraphrasing into noisy style or nor-
malizing into standard language. Here we demon-
strate its capability to normalize tweets at the
sentence-level.
5.2.1 Baselines
Much effort has been devoted recently for devel-
oping normalization dictionaries for Microblogs.
One of the most competitive dictionaries avail-
able today is HB-dict+GHM-dict+S-dict used by
Han et al (2012), which combines a manually-
constructed Internet slang dictionary , a small
(Gouws et al, 2011) and a large automatically-
126
derived dictionary based on distributional and
string similarity. We evaluate two baselines using
this large dictionary consisting of 41181 words;
following Han et. al. (2012), one is a simple dic-
tionary look up. The other baseline uses the ma-
chinery of statistical machine translation using this
dictionary as a phrase table in combination with
Twitter and NYT language models.
5.2.2 System Details
Our base normalization system is the same as
the paraphrase model described in ?5.1.1, except
that the distortion model is turned off to exclude
reordering. We tuned the system towards cor-
rect spelling and grammar by adding a language
model built from all New York Times articles
written in 2008. We also filtered out the phrase
pairs which map from in-vocabulary to out-of-
vocabulary words. In addition, we integrated the
dictionaries by linear combination to increase the
coverage of phrase-based SMT model (Bisazza et
al., 2011).
5.2.3 Evaluation Details
We adopt the normalization dataset of Han and
Baldwin (2011), which was initially annotated
for the token-level normalization task, and which
we augmented with sentence-level annotations.
It contains 549 English messages sampled from
Twitter API from August to October, 2010.
5.2.4 Results
Normalization results are presented in figure 5.
Using only our phrase table extracted from Twit-
ter events we achieve poorer performance than the
state-of-the-art dictionary baseline, however we
find that by combining the normalization dictio-
nary of Han et. al. (2012) with our automatically
constructed phrase-table we are able to combine
the high coverage of the normalization dictionary
with the ability to perform phrase-level normaliza-
tions (e.g. ?outta? ? ?out of? and examples in
?4) achieving both higher PINC and BLEU than
the systems which rely exclusively on word-level
mappings. Our phrase table also contains many
words that are not covered by the dictionary (e.g.
?pts? ? ?points?, ?noms? ? ?nominations?).
6 Conclusions

ing parallel monolingual text from Twitter, and
built the first in-domain models for paraphrasing

showed that because tweets include both normal
and noisy language, paraphrase systems built from
Twitter can be fruitfully applied to the task of nor-
malizing noisy text, covering phrase-based nor-
malizations not handled by previous dictionary-
based normalization systems. We also make our
Twitter-tuned paraphrase models publicly avail-
able. For future work, we consider developing ad-
ditional methods to improve the accuracy of tweet
clustering and paraphrase pair selection.
