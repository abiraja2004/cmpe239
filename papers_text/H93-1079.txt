PROJECT GOALS " 
The primary objective of this basic research 
program is to develop robust methods and 
models for speaker-independent acoustic 
recognit ion of spontaneously-produced, 
continuous peech. The work has focussed on 
developing accurate and detailed models of 
phonemes and their coarticulation .for the ? 
purpose of large-vocabulary continuous peech 
recognition. Important goals of this work are to 
achieve the highest possible word recognition 
accuracy in continuous peech and to develop 
methods for the rapid adaptation of phonetic 
models to the voice of a new speaker. 
RECENT RESULTS 
Ported the BYBLOS system to the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ) corpus. We found that the 
techniques that we had developed for 
recognition of the ATIS corpus worked 
quite well without modification on the WSJ 
corpus. 
Performed several key experiments on the 
WSJ corpus. We verified our conjecture that 
a speaker-independent system trained on a 
small number of speakers has about the 
same word error rate as a system trained on a 
large number of speakers, assuming the 
same total amount of training speech. This 
is the first time that this result has been 
performed in a well-controlled way for large 
vocabulary speech recognition. We also 
verified that training the system separately 
on each of the speakers and averaging the 
resulting models results in essentially the 
same performance as training on all of the 
data at once. These results have wide 
ranging implications for data collection and 
system design. 
We have shown that, for large vocabulary 
recognition, a speaker-independent system 
will have about the same error rate as a 
speaker-dependent system when the speaker- 
independent system is trained on about 15 
times as much speech as the corresponding 
speaker-dependent system. 
We showed that a simple blind 
deconvolution method for microphone 
independence, in which the mean cepstrum 
is subtracted from each eepstrurn vector, is 
somewhat better than the RASTA method. 
Developed a new algorithm for microphone 
independence which uses a codebook 
transformation, based on selection among 
several known microphones. The algorithm 
reduced the word error rate for unknown 
microphones by 20% over using blind 
deconvolution alone. 
In the Nov. 1992 speech recognition test on 
the ATIS domain, our BYBLOS system 
continued to give the best results of all sites 
tested, with a 30% reduction in word error 
over last year. In our first test on the WSJ 
corpus, our system had the second lowest 
error  rates. 
Chaired the CSR Corpus Coordinating 
Committee. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
For the coming year, we plan to continue our 
work on improving speech recognition 
performance both on the Wall Street Journal 
corpus and on the spontaneous ATIS speech 
corpus. We plan to explore different 
pararneterizations of the speech signal and new 
models for microphone and speaker adaptation.
