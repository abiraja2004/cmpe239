Abstract
We investigate how novel English-derived
words (anglicisms) are used in a German-
language Internet hip hop forum, and what
factors contribute to their uptake.
1 Introduction
Because English has established itself as something
of a global lingua franca, many languages are cur-
rently undergoing a process of introducing new loan-
words borrowed from English. However, while the
motivations for borrowing are well studied, includ-
ing e.g. the need to express concepts that do not have
corresponding expressions in the recipient language,
and the social prestige associated with the other lan-
guage (Hock and Joseph, 1996), the dynamics of this
process are poorly understood. While mainstream
political debates often frame borrowing as evidence
of cultural or linguistic decline, it is particularly per-
vasive in youth culture, which is often heavily influ-
enced by North American trends. In many countries
around the globe, hip hop fans form communities in
which novel, creative uses of English are highly val-
ued (Pennycook, 2007), indicative of group mem-
bership, and relatively frequent. We therefore study
which factors contribute to the uptake of (hip hop-
related) anglicisms in an online community of Ger-
man hip hop fans over a span of 11 years.
2 The MZEE and Covo corpora
We collected a ?12.5M word corpus (MZEE) of fo-
rum discussions from March 2000 to March 2011
on the German hip hop portal MZEE.com. A man-
ual analysis of 10K words identified 8.2% of the
tokens as anglicisms, contrasting with only 1.1%
anglicisms in a major German news magazine, the
Spiegel (Onysko, 2007, p.114). These anglicisms
include uninflected English stems (e.g., battle, rap-
per, flow) as well as English stems with English in-
flection (e.g., battled, rappers, flows), English stems
with German inflection (e.g., gebattlet, rappern,
flowen ?battled, rappers, to flow?), and English stems
with German derivational affixes (e.g., battlema?ssig,
rapperische, flowendere ?battle-related, rapper-like,
more flowing?), as well as compounds with one
or more English parts (e.g., battleraporientierter,
hiphopgangstaghettorapper, maschinengewehrflow
?someone oriented towards battle-rap, hip hop-
gangsta-ghetto-rapper, machinegun flow?). We also
collected a ?20M word corpus (Covo) of English-
language hip hop discussion (May 2003 - November
2011) from forums at ProjectCovo.com.
3 Identification of novel anglicisms
In order to identify novel anglicisms in the
MZEE corpus, we have developed a classifier
which can identify anglicism candidates, includ-
ing those which incorporate German material (e.g.,
mo?chtegerngangsterstyle ?wannabe gangster style?),
with very high recall. Since we are not interested in
well-established anglicisms (e.g., Baby, OK), non-
English words, or placenames, our goal is quite
different from the standard language identification
problem, including Alex (2008)?s inclusion classi-
fier, which sought to identify ?foreign words? in
general, including internationalisms, homographic

words, and non-German placenames, but ignored
hybrid/bilingual compounds and English words with
German morphology during evaluation. Our final
system consists of a binary classifier augmented
with dictionary lookup for known words and two
routines to deal with German morphology (affixa-
tion and compounding).
The baseline classifier We used MALLET (Mc-
Callum, 2002) to train a maximum entropy classi-
fier, using character 1- through 6-grams (including
word boundaries) as features. Since we could not
manually annotate a large portion of the MZEE cor-
pus, the training data consisted of the disjoint sub-
sets of the English and German CELEX wordlists
(Baayen et al., 1995), as well as the words used
in Covo (to obtain coverage of hip hop English).
We tested the classifier using 10-fold cross valida-
tion on the training data and on a manually anno-
tated development set of 10K consecutive tokens
from MZEE. All data was lowercased (this improved
performance). We excluded from both data sets
4,156 words shared by the CELEX wordlists (such
as Greek/Latin loanwoards common to both lan-
guages and homographs such as hat), 100 common
German and 50 common English stop words, all 3-
character words without vowels and 1,019 hip hop
artists/label names, which reduced the development
set from 10K tokens, or 3,380 distinct types, to 4,651
tokens and 2,741 types.
Affix-stripping Since German is a moderately in-
flected language, anglicisms are often ?hidden? by
German morphology: in geflowt ?flowed?, the En-
glish stem flow takes German participial affixes. We
therefore included a template-based affix-stripping
preprocessing step, removing common German af-
fixes before feature extraction. Because of the
possibility of multiple prefixation or suffixation
(e.g. rum-ge-battle (?battling around?) or deep-er-en
(?deeper?)), we stripped sequences of two prefixes
and/or three suffixes. Our list of affixes was built

from commonly-affixed stems in the MZEE corpus
and a German grammar (Fagan, 2009).
Compound-cutting Nominal and adjectival com-
pounding is common in German, and loanword
compounds are commonly found in MZEE:
(1) a. chart|tauglich (?suitable for the charts?)
b. flow|maschine|ma?ssig (?like a flow ma-
chine?)
c. Rap|vollpfosten (?rap dumbasses?)
Since these contain features that are highly indica-
tive of German (e.g. -lich#, a?, and pf ), we devised a
compound-cutting procedure for words over length
l (=7): if the word is initially classified as German,
it is divided several ways according to the param-
eters n (=3), the number of cuts in each direction
from the center, and m (=2), the minimum length of
each part. Both halves are classified separately, and
if the maximum anglicism classifier score out of all
splits exceeds a target confidence c (=0.7), the orig-
inal word is labeled a candidate anglicism. Parame-
ter values were optimized on a subset of compounds
from the development set.
Dictionary classification When applying the clas-
sifier to the MZEE corpus, words which occur ex-
clusively in one of the German and English CELEX
wordlists are automatically classified as such. This
improved classifier results over tokens and types, as
seen in Table 1 in the comparison of token and type
precision for the dict/nodict conditions.
Evaluation We evaluated our system by adjusting
the classifier threshold to obtain a recall level of 95%
or higher on anglicism tokens in the development set
(see Table 1). The final classifier achieved a per-
token precision of 70% (per type: 67%) at 95% re-
call, a gain of 7% (9%) over the baseline.
Our system identified 1,415 anglicism candidate
types with a corpus frequency of 100 or greater, out
136
of which we identified 851 (57.5%) for further in-
vestigation; 441 (31.1%) were either established an-
glicisms, place names, artist names, and other loan-
words, and 123 (8.7%) were German words.
4 Predicting the fate of anglicisms
We examine here factors hypothesized to play a role
in the establishment (or decline) of anglicisms.
Frequency in the English Covo corpus We first
examine whether a word?s frequency in the English-
speaking hip hop community influences whether
it becomes more frequently used in the German
hip hop community. We aligned four large (>1M
words each) 12-month time windows of the Covo
and MZEE corpora, spanning the period 11-2003
through 11-2007. We used the 851 most fre-
quent anglicisms identified in our system to find
106 English stems commonly used in German
anglicisms, and compute their relative frequency
(aggregated over all word forms) in each Covo
and MZEE time window. We then measure cor-
relation coefficients r between the frequency of
a stem in Covo at time Tt, fEt (stem), and the
change in log frequency of the corresponding an-
glicisms in MZEE between Tt and a later time Tu,

as well as the corresponding p-values, and coeffi-
cients of determination R2 (Table 2). There is a sig-
nificant positive correlation between the variables,
especially for change over a two-year time span.

and year u = t + i
Initial frequency and dissemination in MZEE
In studying the fate of all words in two En-
glish Usenet corpora, Altmann, Pierrehumbert and
Motter (2011, p.5) found that the measures DU
(dissemination over users) and DT (dissemina-
tion over threads) predict changes in word fre-
quency (? log10 f ) better than initial word fre-

is defined as the ratio
of the actual number of users of word w (Uw) over
the expected number of users of w (U?w), and DT =

T?w
is calculated analogously fo the actual/expected
number of threads in which w is used. U?w and T?w
are estimated from a bag-of-words model approxi-
mating a Poisson process.
We apply Altmann et al.?s model to study the dif-
ference in word dynamics between anglicisms and
native words. Since we are not able to lemma-
tize the entire MZEE corpus, this study uses the
851 most common anglicism word forms identified
by our system, treating all word forms as distinct.
We split the MZEE corpus into six non-overlapping
windows of 2M words each (T1 through T6), cal-
culate DUt (w), D
T
t (w) and log10 ft(w) within each
time window Tt. We again measure how well
these variables predict the change in log frequency
? log10 ft:u(w) = log10 fu(w) ? log10 ft(w) be-
tween the initial time Tt and a later time Tu, with
u = t + 1, ..., t + 3.
When measured over all words excluding angli-
cisms, log10 ft, D
U
t , and D
T
t at an initial time are
very weakly (0.0309 < r < 0.0692), but sig-
nificantly (p < .0001) positively correlated with
? log10 ft:u. However, in contrast to Altmann et
al.?s findings that DU and DT serve better than fre-
quency as predictors of word fate, for the set of an-
glicisms (Table 3), all correlations were both nega-
tive and stronger, and initial frequency log10 ft (not
dissemination) is the best predictor, especially as the
time spans increase in length. That is, while most
words? frequency change cannot generally be pre-
dicted from earlier frequency, we find that, for an-
glicisms, a high frequency is more likely to lead to a
decline, and vice versa.1.

Finally, from the comparison of timespans in Ta-
ble 3, we see that the predictive ability (R2) of
the three measures increases as the timespan for
? log10 f becomes longer, i.e., frequency and dis-
semination effects on frequency change do not oper-
ate as strongly in immediate time scales.2.
5 Conclusion
In this study, we examined factors hypothesized to
influence the propagation of words through a com-
munity of speakers, focusing on anglicisms in a Ger-
man hip hop discussion corpus. The first analysis
presented here sheds light on the lexical dynamics
between the English and German hip hop commu-
nities, demonstrating that English frequency corre-
lates positively with change in a borrowed word?s
frequency in the German community?this result is
not shocking, as the communities are exposed to
shared inputs (e.g., hip hop lyrics), but the strength
of this correlation is highest in a two-year timespan,
suggesting a time lag from the frequency of hip hop
terms in English to the effects on those terms in Ger-
man. Future research here could profitably focus on
this relationship, especially for terms whose success
in the English and German hip hop communities is
highly disparate. Investigation of those terms could
suggest non-frequency factors which affect a word?s
variables) in this regard.
2An analysis which truncated the forms in the first two
timespans to match the N of the third confirm that this increase
is not simply an effect of the number of cases considered.
success or failure.
The second analysis, which compared three mea-
sures used by Altmann, Pierrehumbert, and Mot-
ter (2011) to predict lexical frequency change, found
that log10 f , D
U , and DT did not predict frequency
change well for non-anglicism words in the MZEE
corpus, but that log10 f in particular does predict fre-
quency change for anglicisms, though this correla-
tion is inverse; this finding relates to another analysis
of loanwords. In a diachronic study of loanword fre-
quencies in two French newspaper corpora, Chesley
and Baayen (2010, p.1364-5) found that high initial
frequency was ?a bad omen for a borrowing? and
found an interaction effect between frequency and
dispersion (roughly equivalent to dissemination in
the present study): ?As dispersion and frequency in-
crease, the number of occurrences at T2 decreases.?
A view of language as a stylistic resource (Cou-
pland, 2007) provides some explanation for these
counter-intuitive findings: An anglicism which is
used less often initially but survives is likely to in-
crease in frequency as other speakers adopt it for
?cred? or in-group prestige. However, a highly
frequent anglicism seems to become increasingly
undesirable?after all, if everyone is using it, it loses
its capacity to distinguish in-group members (con-
sider, e.g., the widespread adoption of the term bling
outside hip hop culture in the US). This circum-
stance is reflected by a drop in frequency as the word
becomes passe?. This view is supported by ethno-
graphic interviews with members of the German hip
hop community: ?Yeah, [the use of anglicisms is]
naturally overdone, for the most part. It?s targeted
at these 15, 14-year-old kids, that think this is cool.
The crowd! Ah, cool! Yeah, it?s true?the crowd, even
I say that, but not seriously.? -?Peter?, 22, beatboxer
and student at the Hip Hop Academy Hamburg.
In summary, the analyses discussed here lever-
age the opportunities provided by large-scale cor-
pus analysis and by the uniquely language-focused
nature of the hip hop community to investigate is-
sues of sociohistorical linguistic concern: what sort
of factors are at work in the process of linguis-
tic change through contact, and more specifically,
which word-extrinsic properties of stems and word-
forms condition the success and failure of borrowed
English words in the German hip hop community.
