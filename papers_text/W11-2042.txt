Abstract
When a robot is situated in an environment
containing multiple possible interaction part-
ners, it has to make decisions about when to
engage specific users and how to detect and
react appropriately to actions of the users that
might signal the intention to interact.
In this demonstration we present the integra-
tion of an engagement model in an existing di-
alog system based on interaction patterns. As
a sample scenario, this enables the humanoid
robot Nao to play a quiz game with multiple
participants.
1 Introduction
Giving robotic systems the ability to join in conver-
sation with one or multiple users poses many new
challenges for the development of appropriate dia-
log systems and models. When a dialog system is
situated in the real, physical world and used in more
open settings, more effort needs to be spent on estab-
lishing and maintaining clear communication chan-
nels between the system and its users. E.g. the sys-
tem first needs to detect that there are potential users
with whom interacting would be possible, it needs to
decide if a detected person wants to interact with the
system at all and it needs to make decisions when
and how it should try to start an interaction with that
person.
Bohus and Horvitz (2009) have developed a
model for representing the current relation of a user
with such a system (their engagement state) and de-
termining if they want to be involved in an interac-
tion with the system (using explicit engagement ac-
tions and the more abstract engagement intention).
Each user can be engaged in specific interactions
(denoting different ?basic unit[s] of sustained, in-
teractive problem-solving?) and there can be multi-
ple such interactions, each with potentially different
users.
This demonstration shows how an engagement
model inspired by these ideas was integrated into
an existing dialog system and how it helps in real-
izing interactive scenarios with a robot that incorpo-
rate cues for the dialog from the system?s environ-
ment. Section 3 gives more details about this model
and how it is used by the dialog.
2 Scenario
As a scenario for this demonstration we chose a sim-
ple quiz game involving the robot Nao as a host play-
ing with one or multiple human users. At first, the
robot waits until one of the human interaction part-
ners approaches. When the person opens the interac-
tion (i.e. by greeting the robot), the system responds
with an appropriate greeting. While the person con-
tinues to show the intention to interact with the robot
(determined by the process described in section 3.1),
the robot will ask questions randomly chosen from
a predefined set and will try to judge if the person
answered them correctly.
When another person enters the robot?s field of
view, the system also tries to determine if they have
the intention to interact with it. If that is the case, the
system suspends the current interaction with the first
person and actively tries to engage the second per-
son, encouraging him or her to join the ongoing quiz
game. The prospective new player can then choose

to join or decline the request.
As long as one of the engaged participants shows
the intention to interact, the robot continues to ask
questions which all participants can try to answer.
The quiz game is stopped either by an explicit re-
quest of one the users or after all participants have
left the scene.
This scenario serves as a good testbed for the in-
tegration of different cues for the engagement model
and how that model affects the actions taken by the
dialog system. The right-hand side of figure 1 shows
two people interacting with the robot during the quiz
game.
3 System Overview
Figure 2 shows an overview of the different com-
ponents involved in the demonstrated system. This
includes components for the perception (e.g. access-
ing images from the robot?s camera and audio from
its microphones), for generating actions (e.g. using
the robot?s text-to-speech system), the dialog system
itself and a memory system for connecting these di-
verse components.
The dialog system used for this demonstration
is called PaMini, which is short for ?Pattern-based
Mixed-Initiative human-robot Interaction? and is
described in more detail by Peltason and Wrede
(2010). This dialog system was modified in Klotz
(2010) with a model of engagement based on the
ideas presented by Bohus and Horvitz (2009). In
our adaptation of this model, there are extension
points for integrating different sources of informa-
tion about the user?s engagement intentions and ac-
tions, described in the following section.
3.1 Determining the User?s Actions &
Intention
For determining the user?s actions (e.g. if the user
explicitly wants to start an interaction with the sys-
tem), this demonstration uses a set of possible utter-
ances which are simply matched against the results
of a speech recognition module.
To get an estimation of the user?s intention to in-
teract, the image from the robot?s camera is first used
to detect the faces of users and to estimate their cur-
rent visual focus of attention. A module based on
a framework by Ba and Odobez (2009) is used to
determine probabilities that the user is looking at
each of a pre-defined list of possible focus targets,
including the robot itself and other users visible in
the scene. The upper left of figure 1 shows a visu-
alization of this module?s output. Nao denotes the
robot as the focus target with the highest probabil-
ity, while the designation UN is short for the ?unfo-
cused? target.
This list of probabilities is then stored in a mem-
342

ory system developed by Wienke and Wrede (2011).
The memory system provides temporal query capa-
bilities which are finally used to guess a user?s cur-
rent intention of interacting with the robot based on
the history of the probabilities that the robot was the
user?s current visual focus of attention target. This
result is also stored in the memory system together
will all other information known about a user.
3.2 Engagement Cues for the Dialog
The dialog system receives the information about the
user?s state and intention from the memory system
and uses it in several rules for controlling its own en-
gagement actions. The intention is e.g. used to deter-
mine if there is a new user that should be persuaded
to join the quiz game described in section 2 and if
any of the users still shows interest so that a new
question should be asked. The general state of the
detected users is also used e.g. to observe when the
users leave the robot?s field of view for a longer pe-
riod of time which causes the dialog system to close
its current interaction.
4 Conclusion
We have shown how an existing dialog system that
was enhanced using an explicit model of engage-
ment can be used to realize interactive scenarios
with a robot that is situated in the physical world.
An estimation of the user?s current visual focus of
attention is used to gauge their intention to engage
the robot in conversation.
