Pangloss: A Machine Translation Project

The project involves three sites (NMSU, USC, CMU) and is 
devoted to enhancing the state of the art in machine translation 
of natm'al language texts. 
Pangloss uses a hybrid, multi-engine approach, though 
knowledge-based machine translation takes a majority of re- 
sources. 
Types of work in the knowledge-based direction include: 
? continuing development of a set of knowledge acquisi- 
tion tools and utilities to support the above work. 
? building high-quality syntactic, semantic and prag- 
matic analyzers for the source languages (Spanish and 
Japanese); 
? developing a high-quality text planner and generator for 
the target language (English); 
? designing a highly-expressive text meaning representa- 
tion language (the interlingua) in which the results of 
analysis and input to generation are recorded; 
? putting togethera detailed domain model ("ontology") 
and, for each of the languages involved, a lexicon which 
maps lexical units of respective languages into elements 
of the world model and a grammar. 
Other types of work includes 
? developing an example-based machine translation en- 
gine, a first system of this kind to attempt processing of 
full text rather than specific examples; 
? developing a back-up lexical transfer system based on 
a battery of glossaries, dictionaries, gazetteers, etc. and 
fortified with morphological nalysis and synthesis rou- 
tines; 
? developing a mechanism for integrating the results of the 
multiple MT engines in a hybrid, multi-engine system; 
? continuing development, deployment and testing of a 
human-computer interface, a translator's workstation, 
to support postediting and interactive editing during the 
operation of the translation system; and
