Abstract: A calculus is presented which 
al lows an ef f ic ient  treatment of the fol low- 
ing components: Tenses, temporal conjunc- 
tions, temporal adverbials (of "definite" 
type), temporal  quant i f icat ions and phases. 
The phases are a means for structur ing the 
set of t ime-points t where a certain propo- 
sit ion is valid. For one proposit ion there 
may exist several "phase"-perspect ives.  The 
calculus has integrat ive propert ies,  i. e. 
all f ive components are represented by the 
same formal means. This renders possible a 
rather easy combinat ion of all informations 
and condit ions coming from the aforesaid 
components. 
I. Prerequis i ts  
We assume that proposi t ions are replaced by 
phase-sets:  A proposi t ion R is something 
which is true or false at each point t of the 
time axis U: 
Value(R,t) = T(rue) or F(alse). 
A phase is an interval (span or moment) p 
on the time axis, which a truth value 
(denoted by q(p)) is ass igned to: 
q(p) = T: p is an aff i rmative (main-)phase. 
q(p) = F: p is a decl in ing (secondary) phase. 
A phase-set  P is a pair \[P~,q\]: P~ is a set 
of intervals p and q is an evaluat ion func- 
tion ass igning a truth value to each p6 P~. 
The subst i tut ion of proposi t ions R by 
phase-sets P is not unequivocal ,  but also 
not arbitrary. Some necessary condit ions 
for the re lat ionship between R and its 
"surrogate" P have been introduced and 
discussed elsewhere (Kunze 1986). One 
essential  point is that the simple "moment 
logic" becomes an "interval logic". 
This is also connected with quest ions as 
expressed by the di f ferent def in i t ions of 
HOLD, OCCUR and OCCURING in Al len 1984. 
Another fact connected with phases is the 
unsymmetry in the case of a negation: 
(I) The museum is open today. 
+ The museum is open all day today. 
(2) The museum is closed today. 
= The museum is closed all day today. 
The proposi t ion R is supposed to be 
fixed and given. P is considered as var iable 
and provides a formal counterpart  of 
d i f ferent phase-perspect ives for a certain 
proposit ion.  The German sentence 
(3) Thomas raucht. 
has at least two of them (and consequent ly  
two meanings):  "Thomas is a smoker" and 
"Thomas is smoking". Furthermore the use of 
phases enables us to consider some parts of 
T(R) as unimportant,  accidental  or excep- 
tional. These parts form decl in ing phases 
of R. The af f i rmat ive phases of R need not 
be disjunct, and they need not be contained 
in T(R). It is also possible to introduce 
nested phases, so that rather compl icated 
courses may be rcpresented. 
2. Some formal def in it ions 
? = p~ Let PI \[ i' qi \] (i : 1,2) be two phase- 
sets with P~ : P~. Then PI and P2 may be 
connected by means of sentential  logic: 
For any functor "o" (e. g. "... and ..." 
and "if , then . ") . . . . . . .  one def ines 
P~ o P2 D~f \[P~, ql o q21 with P~ : p~ : p~. 
Phase-operators  connect arbi t rary phase- 
sets. As an example we take the phase- 
operator OCC: 
\[P~q\] = P : OCC(PI ,P 2) means P~ = PI and 
I T, if q1(p) = T and there is a p26P2 q(p)= with q2(P2 ) = T and p ~ P2 % @' F otherwise. 
" " " ~ P2"  If one replaces pnp2 # ~ by p = , 
one gets the def in i t ion of P = PER(PI,P2) . 
P = OCC(PI ,P 2) means "P2 happens during PI"' 
P = PER(PI'P2) "P2 happens throughout PI" 
The important point is that these relat ion-  
ships between PI and P2 are not represented 
by a Yes-No-decis ion,  but again by a phase- 
set P: OCC(PI,P2) selects from the T-phases 
of the first argument those p for which the 
character ist ic  condit ion (= there is a P2 
350 
with  q2(P2 ) = T and p ~ P2 % @) is fu l f i l l ed .  
The phase-operator  OCC is not the same 
th ing  as OCCUR or OCCURING in A l len  1984. 
There  are at least  three d i f fe rences :  OCCUR 
is a Yes -No-pred icate ,  has as f i rs t  a rgument  
an event  and as second an in terva l land  the 
arguments  are no sets as in our  case. It 
makes  at any rate d i f f i cu l t ies  to genera l i ze  
such a Yes -No-proper ty  for sets as a rguments .  
This  is one reason  for our de f in i t ions .  More  
impor tant  is that  e. g. OCC(P I ,P  2) may be 
used as a rgument  in another  phase-operator .  
This  enab les  us to express  qu i te  eas i ly  the 
essent ia l  t ime re la t ion  in "In Ju ly  there are 
even ing-p lanes  on Tuesday  and Fr iday . " .  
One needs  some other  operat ions :  
G iven  P = \[P~,q\], then alt(P) conta ins  
exact ly  those phases  wh ich  one gets by jo in-  
ing al l  phases  of P wh ich  are not seperated  
f rom each  o ther  and have the same q -va lue  
( induct ive ly  unders tood) .  
If one des ignates  by U ? the phase-set  
cons is t ing  on ly  of U as in terva l  (with 
q(U) : T) , then alt(P) = U O means that  the 
un ion  of al l  T -phases  of P covers  the 
t ime axis  U, i. e. "P is a lways  true".  
In sect? I. we a l ready  sketched  how to 
represent  p ropos i t ions  R by phase-sets  P. 
We wr i te  P = <R>. Now we have to exp la in  
the same for tempora l  adverb ia l s :  <tuesday> 
is a phase--set P, whose  in terva ls  p are the 
days, and exact ly  the Tuesdays  have the 
q -va lue  T. In <day> al l  in te rva ls  (: day) 
have the q -va lue  T. <1982> is a phase-set  
w i th  years  as in terva ls ,  but on ly  one 
(:"1982") has the q -va lue  T. Obv ious ly  
x<tuesday> is a s ing le  unspec i f ied  Tuesday,  
x<day> an unspec i f ied  day. 
3. Examples  
Now we are ready  to give some examples .  
Let be R = " John goes to see Mary".  <R> : P 
is obv ious ly  the set of a l l  v i s i t s  of John 
to Mary.  Then  we have: 
(4) In 1982 John want  to see Mary  every  
Tuesday.  
is represented  by the fo l low ing  cond i t ion  
(,,~" for "if ..., then ...") : 
(5) a l t (<1982> ~ PER (<year> , ... 
a l t (<tuesday> -~ OCC(<day>,P) ) ) )  : U ? 
This  has to be read as: It is t rue 
. (a\]t(. . .)  = U?), that  1982 is a year,  dur inq  
wh ich  (<1982> ~ PER(.cyear>, ...) it was/ 
i s /w i l l  be a lways  the case (alt(. . .))  that  
every  Tuesday  is a day, when it occur red /  
occurs /w i l l  occur  (<tuesday> ~ OCC(<day>,  
...)) that  R happens .  It shou ld  be noted 
that (5) has no re ference  to tenses\[  
Whereas  (4) represents  someth ing  wi th  the 
log ica l  s tatus  of be ing  true or false, (6) 
de f ines  a cer ta in  phase-set :  
(6) The Tuesdays  when John want  to see Mary  
The cor respond ing  express ion  is 
(7) OCC (<tuesday> ,P) . 
Th is  t ime the additional, cond i t ion  is not 
a\ ] t ( . . . )  = U O as before ,  but a l t (o. . )  + ~ U ? 
("~" as s ign for negat ion ,  ~ U ? the phase-  
set conta in ing  on ly  U as in terva l  w i th  
g (U) : ~') : 
(8) a l t (OCC(<tuesday:>,P)  : ~ U ? 
This  means:  
(9) There  is at \].east one Tuesday  when R 
happened.  
In th is  case it is poss ib le  to app ly  the 
x -operat ion  (to (7)): 
(10) xOCC(<tuesday>,\ ]?)  
This  can be paraphrased  as 
(I I) A Tuesday  when John  went  to see Mary  
Beh ind  these examples  stand some genera\]  
quest ions :  \]'he two cond i t ion  a l t ( . . . )  = U ? 
and a l t ( . . . )  # ~ U ? have the s tatus  of 
t ru th -cond i t ions .  They re fer  to the two 
cases,  where  a phase-set  is cons idered  as a 
Yes -No-proper ty  and where  it is the bas is  
for a determined  (or def ined)  t ime, wh ich  is 
aga in  a phase-set .  This  becomes  c lear  by 
(I 2) As long as John went  to see Mary  every  
Tuesday  (she be l ieved  in his p romise  of 
marr iage)  . 
These spans (there may be more!)  have to be 
represented  by 
(13) a l t (<tuesday> ~ OCC(<day>,P) )  
w i th  t ru th -cond i t ion  a l t ( . . . )  % ~ U ? (for 
112) becomes  inacceptab le ,  if there is no 
such Tuesday  at a l l ! ) .  Is R = "Mary be l ieves  
in John 's  p romise  of marr iage"  and <R> = P, 
so 
351 
(14) a l t (PER(a l t (<tuesday> 
OCC(<day>,P)) ,P))  = U ? 
is the corresponding expression for (12). If 
we take (13) as ~, (5) becomes 
(15) alt(<1982> ~ PER(<year>,~)) = U ? 
and (14) becomes 
(16) alt(PER(~,P)) = U ?. 
Using the def in i t ion of PER one gets 
(17) alt(<~982> ~ PER(<year>,P)) = U ?, 
which can be paraphrased as 
(18) During 1982 Mary bel ieved in John's 
promise of marriage. 
This answers a second general question: Time 
logical inferences may be based on these 
expressions which represent phase-sets. 
Another quest ion concerns quant i f icat ion.  
The expressions avoid the (always trouble- 
some) quant i f icat ion and render it possible 
to per form the inferences rather simply. 
The quant i f icat ions are "hidden" in the 
fol lowing sense: The expression 
(19) Vx3y alt(OCC(XPl ,YP2))  # ~ U ? 
(for every T-phase Pl of Pl there is a T- 
phase P2 of P2 such that P2 happens during 
pl ) is equivalent to 
(20) alt(P I ~ OCC(PI,P2)) = U ? 
(an expression without formal quant i f ica-  
tion!). It can be proved, that for every ex- 
pression with ( l inguist ical ly reasonable) 
quant i f icat ion there is an equivalent  ex- 
pression without expl ic i t  quant i f icat ion.  
The expressions ref lect in fact a 
structure of texts. The const i tuents of 
this structure belong to two categories: 
"proposit ional"  and "temporal", where the 
second includes some quant i f icat ions 
(ever~ Tuesday, ~ on Tuesdays),  
frequencies (three times), measures (for 
three days), (21) gives a s impl i f ied 
version of this structure for (12): 
John want to see Mary p. 
every Tuesday t. p 
she bel ieved ... p. 
So we have three types of structures (if we 
restr ict  ourselves to the sentence- level) :  
(a) the syntact ic structure (e.g. a 
dependency tree), 
352 
(b) the macrostructure as in (21), which has 
some features of a const i tuent  tree, but 
reminds more of categor ia l  grammar, if 
one considers the problem thoroughly,  
(c) the structure of the express ion (14) for 
(12) . 
They may be used as interface structures for 
two steps of analysis.  The step from (b) to 
(c) has to apply rules, which we already 
used for (5): 
(22) P every Tuesday 
alt(<tuesday> -, OCC(<day>,P))  
(23) as long as P , P ~ alt(PER(P,P)) 
etc. It should be noted, that the three 
essent ia l  temporal  parts in (21) are ex- 
pressed by total ly di f ferent means: 
Tuesday : phase-set  
every : ... ~ PO(.. . , . . .)  
(PO = var iable phase-operator)  
as long as : phase-operator  
Another example is 
(24) P only on Tuesdays ~ 
alt(OCC(<day>,P) ~tuesday>
