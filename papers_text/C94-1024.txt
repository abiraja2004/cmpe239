Abst rac t :  In a lexicalized grammar Ibrnlal- 
isni such as LexicMized Tree-Adjoining (h'~unmar 
( I3'AG), each lexicM item is associated with at 
least one elementary structure (supertag) that 
localizes syntactic a.nd semantic dependencies. 
Thus a parser for a lexicalized grammar must 
search a large set of supertags to choose the right 
ones to combine for the parse of the sentence. We 
present techniques I'or dlsambiguating supertags 
using local inlorlnlttion s~Lch as lexicM preference 
and local lexicN dependencies. Tim similarity 
between LTAG and l)ependency grammars i ex- 
ploited in the dependency niodel of snpertag dis- 
a.mbiguation. The performance results for vari- 
otis models of supert;tg disambigu~ttk)n such as 
unigram; trigram and dependency-based models 
are presented.

l>art-of-spee<:h disanll>iguation techni<lues (tag- 
gers) are often used to eliminat<, (or sul>sl;an- 
tlally reduce) the lm.rt-of-spee,<;h anil>iguity prior 
to parsing. The ta.ggel's are all local hi the sense 
that they use inform~tion front a limited context 
in deciding which tag(s) to choose for each word. 
As is well known, these taggers are quil;e, success- 
ful. 
In a lexicalized grammar such its the I,exicM- 
ized "Dee-Adjoining Grammar (13~AG), each lex- 
ical item is associated with at least one elemen- 
tary structure (tree). The elementary structures 
of I'PAG localize dependencies, including long 
distance dependencies, by requiring that M1 and 
only the dependent elements be present within 
the saute structnre. As a result of this localiza- 
tion, a IoxicM item may be (a.nd, in general, a,1- 
most alwa,ys is) associa,ted with more. than one 
elementary structure. ~Ve will cMl these ele.- 
mentary structures upertags ,  in order to dis- 
tinguish them l'rom the standard part-of-speech 
tags. Note that even when a word has a unique 
standard part-of-speech, say a verb (V), there 
will usually lie more than one superta.g associated 
with this word. Since when the parse is complete, 
there is only one supertag for each word (assum- 
ing there is no global ambiguity), an L'\['AC, parser 
(SchMms, 1988) nee.ds to search a large space o1" 
supertags to select the right one lbr each word 
before combining them for the parse of a. sen- 
tence. It is this 1)roblem of supertag dis;unbigua- 
tion that we address in I, his paper. 
Since l,'l.'A(',s are lexlcalized, we are. presented 
with a novel opportunil;y to elimill;tte or substan- 
tially reduce the supertag assignnmnt ambigu- 
ity by using local information such a.s local lex- 
ical dependencies, prior to parsing. As in stan- 
dard lmrt-ofslieech disambiguatioii, we can use 
local statistical iufortnatiot~ in the term o\[n-gt'anl 
models based Oil the distri l)ution of stiperl;ags hi 
a I,'I'A(I liarsed corpus. Moreover, since the sli- 
l)erta.gs elicode depemde, ncy hfl'ornlal;k)n~ we can 
also use informa.tion about the distribution of dis- 
tances between a, given superi;ag and its depen- 
dent su perl;ags. 
Note that its ill sta,ndard part-of-speech disaun- 
biguation, superl;ag disambiguation could have 
been done by a parser, lloweveG carrying out 
part-of-speech disaml)igua.tion prior to pamsing 
lnMces the job o1' the. parser much easier and 
therefore, speeds it np. Stlpertag disalnl)igua- 
tion a.s proposed in this paper reduces the work 
of the parser even further. After snpertag dis- 
ainbiguation, we have effectively completed the 
1,54 
parse *rod the p~u'ser need 'only'  (:omhine the indi- 
vi(hlM structures; hence the term--ahnost  parsing. 
This method can a.lso be used go i)~v'se senten(:e 
fragments in cases where the snpertag sequence 
after the disambiguat ion may not combine into :L 
single structure. 
The ma.in tom of this paper is to present 
te.chniques for dis~unbiguating Sul)erta.gs , and to 
(wahu~te their pe\]'formm~ce a.nd their impa.ct on 
I;I'AG parsing. Although presented with resl)ect

5.2 n -gram mode l  
In a unigram model a word is always associated 
with the supertag that is most preferred by the 
word, irrespective of the context in which the 
word appears. An Mternate method that is sen- 
sitive to context is the n-gram model. The n- 
gram model takes into account he eontextuaJ de- 
pendency probabilities between supertags within 
a window of n words in associating supertags 
with words. Thus the most prob~tble supertag 
sequence for a N word sentence is given by 
Y' = argmaxr Pr(T~,5'~,...,TN) * 
Pr(I'VI,I'V2,...,WN IT~/&,. . . ,7~) 
To compute this using only local information, 
we approximate, taking the I)robM)ility of a word 
to depend only on its supertag 
Pr(W1,W2,.. . ,WN IT, ,T2,. . . ,7~) 
l-I Y_-, Pr(l+~,' I ~1~) 
and also use an n-gram (trigram, in this case) 
approximation 
P"OL-'&,. . . ,TN) ~ F\[~, P"('/~ I "L-~, '/t~-I) 
5.2.1 Exper iments  and Resu l ts  
A trigram model has been used to model the 
contextual dei)endencies in supertag sequences. 
Again, due to sparseness of (hint, the particu- 
lar words have been ignored and the training of 
the tr igram model has been done on the part-of- 
speech/supertag pair. The model has been tested 
on the same set of held out sentences as in the 
unigram experiment. The percentage success is 
68%, i.e., 68% of the words of the test corpus 
were assigned the correct sui)ertag. 
5.3 Dependency  mode l

pertags, dependencies t)etween supertags that 
appear beyond the n word window ea, nnot be in- 
corporated into the mode.1. This l imitation can 
be overcome, if no a priori bound is set on the size 
o\[" the window but instead a prol)ability distril)u- 
tion of the distanee.s o\[' the <lel)endent supertags 
for each supertag is ma.intained. A supertag is 
dependent on another supert~g i\[' the former sul)- 
stitutes or adjoins into tit(.' latter "~. 
5.3.1 Exper iments  and l / ,esults

dency model of supertag disambigua.tion. Ide-

For example, the fourth entry in the T:d)le ;I 
reads that the tree (~2, a.nehored 1)y a verl) (V ) ,  
has a left and a right dependent ( - ,  +) and the

combined to form a complete structure, the "at- 
most parse" may mdee(i be the best one can do. 
In case of LTAG, even though no exl)licit 
substitutions or adjunctions are shown, the de- 
pendencies among LTAG trees uniquely iden- 
tify the combining operation between the trees 
and the node at which the operation (:an be 
performed is almost always unique s. Thus su- 
pertag disambiguation is almost parsing lbr UI'- 
AGs. In contrast, the dependencies among the 
CCG categories do not result in directly identi- 
fying the combining operations between the cate- 
gories since two categories can often be corn I)ined 
in more than one way. Hence for CCG fiu'ther 
processing needs to be performed to obtain the 
complete parse of the sentence, although without 
any supertag ambiguities. 
The supertag disaml)iguation, dependency 
model in particular, is even closer to p~wsing in 
dependency grammar formalism, l)ependency 
parsers establish relationships among words, un- 
like the phrase-structure parsers which construct 
a phrase-structure tree spanning the words of 
the input. Since LTAGs are lexicalized and 
each elementary tree is associated will, a.t least 
one lexical item, the supertag disaml)iguation 
for EPAG can therefore be viewed as establish- 
ing the relationship a among words as depen- 
dency parsers do. Then the elementary stru(> 
tures that the related words anchor are combined 
to reconstruct he phrase-structure tree similar 
to the result of phrase-structure parsers. Th,s  
the interplay of both dependency ,~nd phrase- 
structure grammars can be seen in U\['AGs. Ram- 
bow and Joshi (R, ambow and Joshi, 1993) dis- 
cuss in greater detail the use of LTAC, in reh~ting 
dei)endency analyses to phrase-structure analy- 
ses and I)rOl)OSe a dei)endency-I)ased l)arser for a, 
phrase-structure based grammar. 
In summary, we have presented a new tech- 
nique that performs the disambiguation of su- 
pertags using local intbrmation such as lexi('al 
preference and local lexical dependencies. This 
technique, like part-of-speech disambigua.tlon, ro.- 
duces the disambiguation task that needs to be 
Sin some cases, the dependency information between 
an auxiliary and an elementary tree may be insufficient o 
uniquely identify the address of adjunction, if the auxiliary 
tree can adjoin to more than one node in the elementary 
tree, since the specific attachments are not shown.

trees that the words anchor. 
done 1)y the parser. After the disa.nd)iguation, 
we have effectively comi)leted the parse of the 
sentence ~md the parser needs %nly' to coml)lete 
the ~djunction and substitutions. This method 
can also serve to parse Selltetlce \['ra~lfleuts ill
cases where the supertag sequence after the dis- 
ambiguation may not contbine to form a single 
structure. We have implemented this technique 
of disambiguation using the n-gram models using 
the prol)ability data collected from LTAG I)arsed 
corpus. The similarity between l i lAC  and l)e- 
pendency grammars is exploited in the (lepen- 
dency mo(M of supertag disambigm~tion. The 
per\['ormance r sults of these models have been 
presented.
