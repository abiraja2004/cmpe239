How to obtain h ierarchical  re la t ions (e .g ,  superordinate 
-hyponym relation, synonym re lat ion)  is one of the most 
important problems for thesaurus construct ion,  A pi lot  
system for extract ing these re lat ions  automatical ly from 
an ordinary Japanese language dict ionary (Shinmeikai Koku- 
gojiten, published hy Sansei-do, in machine readable form) 
is given. The features  of the definition sentences in the 
dict ionary,  the mechanical extract ion of the h ierarchica l  
re lat ions  and the est imation of the resu l t s  are discussed. 
i. INTRODUCTION 
A pract ica l  s ized semantic dict ionary (thesaurus as wide 
sence) is necessary for advanced natural  language process- 
ing. We have been studying how to obtain semantic informa- 
tion for such semantic dictionary from a Japanese language 
dictionary(Shinmeikai Kokugojiten,published by Sanseido,in 
machine readable form)(1) containing about 60,000 entries. 
A dictionary contains meanings and usages of practical 
size of general words. Espec ia l ly ,def in i t ion  sentences{DS: 
a brief notation} are important sources of information for 
meanings of general words. Generally, DS of an entr~word 
{EW:a brief notation} is defined by qualifying its super ~. 
ordinate word or synonyms or hyponyms. We call these words 
definition M~rds{DW:a brief notation}. 
We have been developing a system for extracting automat- 
ically DW related to EW from its DS, and for deciding the 
DW-EW relation (e) . By this system,(hierarchical) relations 
among entry words in the dictionary are to be established. 
We constructed a sub-system for extract ing DSs corre- 
sponding to parts of speech, infrected form and meaning 
(def in i t ion)  number of each entry word(v) .
In th is  paper, the features of DSs in the Japanese dic- 
t ionary,  an out l ine of the pi lot  system and the resu l t s  of 
experiment will be discussed. 
L_ ~EATURES_~RY JAPANE~~DICT IOBANY 
2 .~S~TUR~DS 
The typical examples of DSs are as follows: 
(i) \ [~(z igzag  rule)\] : . . .b~o~?~(poss ib le  to be 
folded)_~h~l~J.,:(rule)o 
(2) \[R~(mountain path)\] : \[...#)q~D(in)~i~(narrow path) 
j O)~(the  nleaning o f )~D~H~f~(a  pol i te expression of)o 
(3) \ [~(b lue  frog)\]  : . . .~O) ( la rge)#An lk ( f rog)59- -~ 
(a kind of)o 
(4) \ [~{~(respect fu l  daughter- in- low)\]  : ~\[(daughter- in-  
i ow) l=)bt~( fo r )~t~j~(a  respect fu l  word)? 
(5) \ [~(autumn insect ) \ ]  : ~ /_ (be l l - ing  insect ) .  
Y~_~i-2_(a kind of c r i cke1: )~ ' (e tC)o  
Where the brackets( \ [ . . . \ ]  ), underl ine,  and parentheses 
(( . . . ))  denote EW, DW, and an English t rans la t ion  for the 
preceding Japanese phrase respect ive ly .  
In (1), the f ina l  word is DW and superordinate-hyponym 
relation(DW>EW) holds between the DW and the EW. 
In (2), DW is the f ina l  word in hook brackets(r . . . j )  and 
DW>EW holds. Tile expression " r . . . jO )~6)~$1~{~"  is 
cal led a funct ional  e~ rpr~e,'ssion{FE:a br ief  notat ion}. The 
(compound) word "~b ' J~"  in the FE is cal led a func- 
k~onA1 word{~W:a br ief  notat ion}. In th i s  case, the FW 
denotes a usage of the EW. 
In (3), DW is just  before the FE "0 ) - -~"  and DW>EW 
holds. In th i s  case, the I~E prescr ibes the DW>EW expl ic-  
i t ly .  The word" - -N"  is the FW. 
In (4), DW is jus t  before the FE " t :~b~?~J~# '' and 
the synonymous relation(DW~EW) holds between the DW and 
the EW. The FW " ~ "  denotes a usage of the EW. 
In (5), two DW<EWs hal(t, that is ,  the DW "NZ '~/~/"  < 
the EW "$~"  and the DW " ~ "  < the Ew "$~"  . In 
th is  case, the number of DNs are more than one, DW i sn ' t  
modified and the FE is  the word "~*"  . The FW is ident i -  
cal with the FE. (Notes: "~ ' "  is  a sub-postpos i t ive 
s ign i fy ing exempl i f icat ion.)  
The features of DSs in the dict ionary are as follows: 
(a) Honorary, the f ina l  ~mrd in DS is DW. 
(b) In some cases, the f ina l  expression in DS is YE 
ass igning semantic re lat ion between DW and EW, 
and DW is just before the PE. 
(c) Genraly, DW is modified by another phrase(modifier). 
(d) In some cases, DS contains more than one DW. 
The following general s t ructure  is  obtained according to 
these features.  
' "  (\[MODIFIER\], DW)*. \[F~\]o 
Notes) \[...\] : optional const i tuent  
(...) : required const i tuent  
* : sequence of coordinate const i tuent (e .g . . ,~)  
? : concatinat ion symbol which is  d i ferent  from 
coordinate const i tuent ( . )  
~or convenience of explanation, the general s t ructure  is  
divided into the following two types. 
( I )  TYPEI: ... (\[MODIFIER\] .DN)*o 
(I1) TYPEII: .,. (\[MODI~\]:ER\] .DW)*. PEa 
445 
In TYPE I, the final word is DW. In TYPEII, the final 
expression is FE, and BW is just before the FE. 
2.2 DW-EW RELATION IN DS 
We will propose the following assumptions according to 
above-mentioned features in order to extruct the DW-EW 
relat ions from DOs of the general structure.  
(~) When DS is in TYPE I , DS~EW. Because DS is a phrase 
(or a compound word) as wide senoe. 
(~) When DS is in TYPEll, SS pFE EW. 
Where pFE is binary relation assigned by FE, and SS 
is the shortened DS corresponding to (\[MODIFIER\], DW)*. 
? \[MODIFIER\] ? W ~ W 
(~) (\[MODIFIERi\] .We) * ~ \[MODIFIERa\] .Wa 
Where i,j : l~n, W is arbitrary word. 
The following general algorithm for deciding the DN-EW 
relations is obtained by means of these assumptions. 
(I) DS is in TYPE I (DS dosn't include FE), 
(A) DW is modified, 
(~) The number of DW is only one, then DW>EW 
(B) The number of DW are more than one, then CD 
(B) DW isn't modified , 
(~) The number of DW is only one, then DW--EW 
(~) The number of DN are more than one, then DN<EW 
(II) DS is in TYPEII(DS includes FE), 
(A) DW is modified , 
(a) The number of DW is only one, 
PFE is '> '  or '---' ,then BW>EW otherwise CO. 
(B) The number of DW are more than one, then CD 
(B) DW isn't modified , 
(a) The number of DW is only one, then DW pFE EW 
(B) The number of DW are more than one, 
pFE is '< '  , then DW<EW otherwise CD. 
CD denotes that ON-EW relat ion i sn ' t  extracted mechani- 
cally from DS. In this case, the extraction of DW-BW rela- 
tion needs human support at this stage. 
2,3 FEATURES OF FE 
FE prescribes hierarchical relations(e.g. DW>EW, DW<EN, 
DW=EW, or DWmEW) or whole-part relation(DW~ EW). (e.g. On 
" \ [~( interbra in) \ ]  :.... ~(bra in)OD--~9 (a part Of)o 
" ,  the FE "6D- -~"  prescribes DW~ EW explicitly.) 
Besides these re lat ions,  another relat ion between DW and 
BW are prescribed by special FEe(e.g. "~T(under)"  ), 
which is called associative relation(R). 
There are so many FEs that they are mainly divided into 
four patterns called functional patterns{FP: a brief nota- 
tion}. FP is expressed by means of regular expression. FP 
is necessary for extracting FE and DW-EW relation informa- 
t_j~_n_(i.e, information eccessary for deciding the DW-EW 
relations) assigned by the FE. FP also designates a place 
of DW in DS, 
Main features of FP are as follows: 
(1) Type100 : \[,..DWj ? ~ ? FW 
(2) Type200 : ...DW ? (~9 . FN)* 
(3) Type3OO : ...DW ? P FW 
(4) Type400 : .,.DW ? e~"  
446 
Motes) ~*  is arbitrary character string, 
(...)* is repitation of (,..), 
P is special phrase(e.g. I c~ '~)  , 
is concatination symbol. 
We got about one hundred seventy FWs. These are classi- 
fied into two groups. In one group(contained 64 FWs), the 
FNs contain explicitly DW-EN relation information. In the 
other group(contained 105 FWs), some of the FWs contain 
usages of the EWe, which are also important to thesaurus. 
We have constructed a FN dictionary which includes FP 
and DW-EW relation information corresponding to the FP. 
3. SYSTEM FOR EXTRACTING DW-EW (HIERARCHICAL) RELATION 
The system consists of the following four steps. 
RE~t ion  of EW and DS 
(a) Extraction of EW, its DS, the part of speech of the 
EW, the definition number of the DS from the dictionary. 
(b) Transformation of the extracted DS to the ordinary 
Japanese sentence's form(called the normalized DS). 
Because several contents(meanings) are thrown into one DS 
by means of parentheses or dot ' ' in the dictionary. 
~D Extraction of FE and DW-EW re l~ information 
The FW Dictionary is used. 
(a) When DS dosen't include FW, DS is in TYPEI. 
(b) When DS includes FW and conforms FP, DS is in TYPEII. 
(c) When DS includes FW but doesn't conform FP or when DS 
includes more than one FW, the DS is picked out as check 
data.Because it is d i f f i cu l t  to dist inguish between DW and 
FW or to extract DW-EW relat ion information mechanically. 
(3) Extraction of DW and DW-HW relation informatio~ 
A general word dictionary (containing about 75,000 noun 
words)(S)is used, in which the character str ings of entry 
words were arranged in inverse order (from right to le f t ) .  
DWs are basical ly extracted by means of longest matching 
method, because there is ordinari ly no space between two 
adjacent words in the Japanese sentence. In addition to 
this .  there are the following problems. 
(a) The 'hiragana' notation is often used(e.g. ~O)~b 
\ [~b\ ]  ). 
(b) The names of animals and plants are described by 
'katakana' (e.g. ~)P  \ [~\ ]  ). 
(c) The unknown(compound) words are often used. 
(d) In some cases, the DS containes more than one ON. 
The oxtructing procedure has to be constructed with 
regard to these ploblems. 
The relation information are also extracted, that is, 'DW 
isn't modified' and 'The number of DN are more than one' . 
When DN isn't extracted (that is,DR is neither 'katakana' 
string nor 'kanji' string nor any entry word in the word 
dictionary) from DS, the DS is picked out as check data. 
(4) Decision of DW-EW relation 
According to the conditions above-mentioned, DW-EW rela- 
tions are decided. 
When extracted relation information is ambiguous, DS is 
picked out as check data. 
PE T R SU T 
A pi lot  system has been implemented on FACOM M-360(Naga- 
saki University Computer Center) and FACON N-382(Kyushu 
University Computer Center) mostly by PL/I. 
The experimental input data(2,824 DSs) in the first step, 
arc the normalized DSs. 
Table 1 shows the number of input, output and check data 
in each step and the number of correct and incorrect  data 
in output data. 
Table 2 shows the extracted DW-EW re lat ions  and the num- 
ber of output data corresponding to the re la t ions .  
The experimental resu l t s  are as follows: 
(1) The rat io  of TYPEI (2,374) to output data(2 ,? l l )  is 
about 87.6%. 
(2) The rat io  of TYPEI1(337) to output data(2,711) is 
about 12.4%. 
(3) The rat io  of output data(2,434) to input data(2,824) 
is about 85%. 
(a) The rat io (ca l led  system precis ion) of correct output 
data(2,311) to output data(2,434) is  about 95 %. 
(b) The rat io (ca l led  error rat io)  of incorrect output 
data(123) to output data(2,434) is about 5%. 
(4) The rat io of check data(390) to input data(2,824) is  
about 14%.

Most of incorrect output data occur in the step of ex- 
t ract ion of DWs which are described by 'h i ragana '  notat ion, 
because of limitaions of the longest matching method. 
The improvement of the resu l t s  necessitates (a) analy- 
sis of the DSs, (b) reinforcement of the general word dic- 
tionary used for extracting the DWs. 
5~CONCLUDINO~RKK~_ 
(1) The similer researches have been carr ied out about 
several  English dictionarys(e.g. LONONAN)(2)(~), however 
there is scaresly any about Japanese dictionary. 
(2) We have extracted automaticlly,DW<EW, DW~EW, DW~ EW 
in addition to DW>EW as the DW-EW relations. 
(3) Input data not su i table for condit ions are picked out 
as check data in each step. 
(4) There are a shortage of semantic information (e.g. 
lack of the adequate DW) in the dict ionary because of 
assuming the human usage of the dictionary. 
We have been invest igat ing  the fol lowings.
