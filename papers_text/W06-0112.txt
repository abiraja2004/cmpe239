Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid ap-
proach to chunking Chinese base noun 
phrases (base NPs), which combines 
SVM (Support Vector Machine) model 
and CRF (Conditional Random Field) 
model. In order to compare the result 
respectively from two chunkers, we use 
the discriminative post-processing 
method, whose measure criterion is the 
conditional probability generated from 
the CRF chunker. With respect to the 
special structures of Chinese base NP 
and complete analyses of the first two 
results, we also customize some appro-
priate grammar rules to avoid ambigui-
ties and prune errors. According to our 
overall experiments, the method 
achieves a higher accuracy in the final 
results. 
1 Introduction  
Chunking means extracting the non-overlapping 
segments from a stream of data. These segments 
are called chunks (Dirk and Satoshi, 2003). The 
definition of base noun phrase (base NP) is sim-
ple and non-recursive noun phrase which does 
not contain other noun phrase descendants. Base 
NP chunking could be used as a precursor for 
many elaborate natural language processing tasks, 
such as information retrieval, name entity extrac-
tion and text summarization and so on. Many 
other problems similar to text processing can also 
benefit from base NP chunking, for example, 
finding genes in DNA and phoneme information 
extraction. 
The initial work on base NP chunking is fo-
cused on the grammar-based method. Ramshaw 
and Marcus (1995) introduced a transformation-
based learning method which considered chunk-
ing as a kind of tagging problem. Their work in-
spired many others to study the applications of 
learning methods to noun phrase chunking. 
(Cardie and Pierce, 1998, 1999) applied a scoring 
method to select new rules and a naive heuristic 
for matching rules to evaluate the results' accu-
racy. 
CoNLL-2000 proposed a shared task (Tjong 
and Buchholz, 2000), which aimed at dividing a 
text in syntactically correlated parts of words. 
The eleven systems for the CoNLL-2000 shared 
task used a wide variety of machine learning 
methods. The best system in this workshop is on 
the basis of Support Vector Machines used by 
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000). 
Recently, some new statistical techniques, 
such as CRF (Lafferty et al 2001) and structural 
learning methods (Ando and Zhang, 2005) have 
been applied on the base NP chunking. (Fei and 
Fernando, 2003) considered chunking as a se-
quence labeling task and achieved good perform-
ance by an improved training methods of CRF. 
(Ando and Zhang, 2005) presented a novel semi-
supervised learning method on chunking and 
produced performances higher than the previous 
best results. 
The research on Chinese Base NP Chunking is, 
however, still at its developing stage. Research-
ers apply similar methods of English Base NP 
chunking to Chinese. Zhao and Huang (1998) 
made a strict definition of Chinese base NP and 
put forward a quasi-dependency model to analy-
sis the structure of Chinese base NPs. There are 
some other methods to deal with Chinese phrase 
(no only base NP) chunking, such as HMM 
(Heng Li et al, 2003), Maximum Entropy (Zhou 
Yaqian et al, 2003), Memory-Based Learning 
(Zhang and Zhou, 2002) etc. 
87
However, according to our experiments over 
30,000 Chinese words, the best results of Chi-
nese base NP chunking are about 5% less than 
that of English chunking (Although we should 
admit the chunking outcomes vary among differ-
ent sizes of corpus and rely on the details of ex-
periments). The differences between Chinese 
NPs and English NPs are summarized as follow-
ing points: First, the flexible structure of Chinese 
noun phrase often results in the ambiguities dur-
ing the recognition procedure. For example, 
many English base NPs begin with the determi-
native, while the margin of Chinese base NPs is 
more uncertain. Second, the base NPs begins 
with more than two noun-modifiers, such as ??
(high)/JJ  ?(new)/JJ ??(technology)/NN?, the 
noun-modifiers ??/JJ ? can not be completely 
recognized. Third, the usage of Chinese word is 
flexible, as a Chinese word may serve with multi 
POS (Part-of-Speech) tags. For example, a noun 
is used as a verbal or an adjective component in 
the sentence. In this way the chunker is puzzled 
by those multi-used words. Finally, there are no 
standard datasets and elevation systems for Chi-
nese base NP chunking as the CoNLL-2000 
shared task, which makes it difficult to compare 
and evaluate different Chinese base NP chunking 
systems. 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to 
extract the Chinese base NPs with the help of the 
conditional probabilities derived from the CRF 
algorithm and some appropriate grammar rules. 
According to our preliminary experiments on 
SVM and CRF, our approach outperforms both 
of them.  
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 gives a brief introduction of the 
data representations and methods. We explain 
our motivations of the hybrid approach in section 
3. The experimental results and conclusions are 
introduced in section 4 and section 5 respectively. 
2 Task Description 
2.1 Data Representation 
Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) gave mainly two 
kinds of base NPs representation ?  the 
open/close bracketing and IOB tagging. For ex-
ample, a bracketed Chinese sentence, 
[ ??(foreign businessmen) ??(investment)] 
?? (become) [ ??  (Chinese) ?? (foreign 
trade)] [ ??(important) ???(growth)] ?  
The IOB tags are used to indicate the bounda-
ries for each base NP where letter ?B? means the 
current word starts a base NP, ?I? for a word in-
side a base NP and ?O? for a word outside a NP 
chunk. In this case the tokens for the former sen-
tence would be labeled as follows:    
??/B ??/I ??/V ??/B ??/I ??/B      
???/O  ?/O   
Currently, most of the work on base NP identi-
fication employs the trainable, corpus-based al-
gorithm, which makes full use of the tokens and 
corresponding POS tags to recognize the chunk 
segmentation of the test data. The SVM and CRF 
are two representative effective models widely 
used. 
2.2 Chunking with SVMs  
SVM is a machine learning algorithm for a linear 
binary classifier in order to maximize the margin 
of confidence of the classification on the training 
data set. According to the different requirements, 
distinctive kernel functions are employed to 
transfer non-linear problems into linear problems 
by mapping it to a higher dimension space.  
By transforming the training data into the form 
with IOB tags, we can view the base NP chunk-
ing problem as a multi-class classification prob-
lem. As SVMs are binary classifiers, we use the 
pairwise method to convert the multi-class prob-
lem into a set of binary class problem, thus the 
I/O/B classifier is reduced into 3 kinds of binary 
classifier ? I/O classifier, O/B classifier, B/I 
classifier. 
In our experiments, we choose TinySVM 1  to-
gether with YamCha 2  (Kudo and Matsumoto, 
2001) as the one of the baseline systems for our 
chunker. In order to construct the feature sets for 
training SVMs, all information available in the 
surrounding contexts, including tokens, POS tags 
and IOB tags. The tool YamCha makes it possi-
ble to add new features on your own. Therefore, 
in the training stage, we also add two new fea-
tures according to the words. First, we give spe-
cial tags to the noun words, especially the proper 
noun, as we find in the experiment the proper 
nouns sometimes bring on errors, such as base

NP ???(Sichuan)/NR ??(basin)/NN?, con-
taining the proper noun ??? /NR?, could be 
mistaken for a single base NP ???/NN?; Sec-
ond, some punctuations such as separating marks, 
contribute to the wrong chunking, because many 
Chinese compound noun phrases are connected 
by separating mark, and the ingredients in the 
sentence are a mixture of simple nouns and noun 
phrases, for example, 
??? (National)/NN ??? ( Statistics Of-
fice)/NN???(Chinese)/NR ??(Social Sci-
ences)/NN ??? (Academy)/NN ? (and)/CC 
??? (Chinese Academy of Sciences)/NN-
SHORT? 
The part of base NP ? ???/B ??/I ???
/I? can be recognized as three independent base 
NPs --???/B ??/B ???/B?. The kind of 
errors comes from the conjunction ??(and)? and 
the successive sequences of nouns, which con-
tribute little to the chunker. More information 
d analyses will be provided in Section 4. an  
2.3 Conditional Random Fields 
Lafferty et al( 2001) present the Conditional 
Random Fields for building probabilistic models 
to segment and label sequence data, which was 
used effectively for base NP chunking (Sha & 
Pereira, 2003). Lafferty et al (2001) point out 
that each of the random variable label sequences 
Y conditioned on the random observation se-
quence X. The joint distribution over the label 
sequence Y given X has the form

    Sha & Pereira (2003) provided a thorough dis-
cussion of CRF training methods including pre-
conditioned Conjugate Gradient, limited-
Memory Quasi-Newton and voted perceptron. 
They also present a novel approach to model 
construction and feature selection in shallow 
parsing.  
We use the software CRF++3 as our Chinese 
base NP chunker baseline software. The results 
of CRF are better than that of SVM, which is the 
same as the outcome of the English base NP 
chunking in (Sha & Pereira, 2003). However, we 
find CRF products some errors on identifying 
long-range base NP, while SVM performs well 
in this aspect and the errors of SVM and CRF are 
of different types. In this case, we develop a 
combination approach to improve the results. 
 
3 Our Approach 
?
 
(Tjong et al, 2000) pointed out that the perform-
ance of machine learning can be improved by 
combining the output of different systems, so 
they combined the results of different classifiers

and obtained good performance. Their combina-
tion system generated different classifiers by us-
ing different data labels and applied respective 
voting weights accordingly. (Kudo and Matsu-
moto 2001) designed a voting arrangement by 
applying cross validation and VC-bound and 
Leave-One-Out bound for the voting weights.  
The voting systems improve the accuracy, the 
choices of weights and the balance between dif-
ferent weights is based on experiences, which 
does not concern the inside features of the classi-
fication, without the guarantee of persuasive 
theoretical supports. Therefore, we developed a 
hybrid approach to combine the results of the 
SVM and CRF and utilize their advantages. 
(Simon, 2003) pointed out that the SVM guaran-
tees a high generalization using very rich features 
from the sentences, even with a large and high-
dimension training data. CRF can build efficient 
and robust structure model of the labels, when 
one doesn?t have prior knowledge about data. 
Figure 1 shows the preliminary chunking and 
pos-processing procedure in our experiments 
 First of all, we use YamCha and CRF++ re-
spectively to treat with the testing data. We got 
two original results from those chunkers, which 
use the exactly same data format; in this case we 
can compare the performance between CRF and 
SVM. After comparisons, we can figure out the 
same words with different IOB tags from the two 
former chunkers. Afterward, there exist two 
problems: how to pick out the IOB tags identi-
fied improperly and how to modify those wrong 
IOB tags.  
To solve the first question, we use the condi-
tional probability from the CRF to help deter-
mine the wrong IOB tags. For each word of the 
testing data, the CRF chunker works out a condi-
tional probability for each IOB tag and chooses 
the most probable tag for the output. We bring 
out the differences between the SVM and CRF, 
such as ??? (Sichuan)? in a base noun phrase 
is recognized as ?I? and ?O? respectively, and 
the distance between P(I| ????) and P(O| ??
??) is tiny. According to our experiment, about 
80% of the differences between SVM and CRF 
share the same statistical characters, which indi-
cate the correct answers are inundated by the 
noisy features in the classifier.

Final result  
Figure 1 the Experiments? Procedure 
 
Using the comparison between SVM and CRF 
we can check most of those errors. Then we 
could build some simple grammar rules to figure 
out the correct tags for the ambiguous words cor-
responding to the surrounding contexts. Then At 
the error pruning step, judging from the sur-
rounding texts and the grammar rules, the base 
NP is corrected to the right form. We give 5 
mainly representative grammar rules to explain 
how they work in the experiments.  
The first simple sample of grammar rules is 
just like ?BNP ? NR NN?, used to solve the 
proper noun problems. Take the ???  (Si-
chuan)/NR/B ?? (basin)/NN/I? for example, 
the comparison finds out the base NP recognized 
as ??? (Sichuan)/NR/I ?? (basin)/NN/B?. 
Second, with respect to the base NP connecting 
with separating mark and conjunction words, two 
rules ?BNP ? BNP CC (BNP | Noun), BNP 
?BNP PU (BNP | Noun)? is used to figure out 
those errors; Third, with analyzing our experi-
ment results, the CRF and SVM chunker recog-
nize differently on the determinative, therefore 
the rule ?BNP ? JJ BNP?, our combination 
methods figure out new BNP tags from the pre-
liminary results according to this rule. Finally, 
the most complex situation is the determination 
of the Base NPs composed of series of nouns, 
especially the proper nouns. With figuring out 
the maximum length of this kind of noun phrase, 
we highlight the proper nouns and then separate 
the complex noun phrase to base noun phrases, 
and according to the our experiments, this 
90
method could solve close to 75% of the ambigu-
ity in the errors from complex noun phrases. To-
tally, the rules could solve about 63% of the 
found errors.  
 
4 Experiments 
The CoNLL 2000 provided the software4 to con-
vert Penn English Treebank II into the IOB tags 
form. We use the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.05, 
which is improved and involved with more POS 
tags, segmentation and syntactic bracketing. As 
the sentences in the Treebank are longer and re-
lated to more complicated structures, we modify 
the software with robust heuristics to cope with 
those new features of the Chinese Treebank and 
generate the training and testing data sets from 
the Treebank. Afterward we also make some 
manual adjustments to the final data.  
 In our experiments, the SVM chunker uses a 
polynomial kernel with degree 2; the cost per 
unit violation of the margin, C=1; and tolerance 
of the termination criterion, 0.01? = . 
In the base NPs chunking task, the evaluation 
metrics for base NP chunking include precision P, 
recall R and the F? . Usually we refer to the F?  
as the creditable metric.

All the experiments were performed on a 
Linux system with 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 and 2G 
memory. The total size of the Penn Chinese 
Treebank words is 13 MB, including about 
500,000 Chinese words. The quantity of training 
corpus amounts to 300,000 Chinese words. Each 
word contains two Chinese characters in average. 
We mainly use five kinds of corpus, whose sizes 
include 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000 and 70,000 
words. The corpus with an even larger size is 
improper according to the training corpus 
amount.

From Figure 2, we can see that the results 
from CRF are better than that from SVM and the 
error-pruning performs the best. Our hybrid er-
ror-pruning method achieves an obvious im-
provement F-scores by combining the outcome 
from SVM and CRF classifiers. The test F-scores 
are decreasing when the sizes of corpus increase. 
The best performance with F-score of 89.27% is 
achieved by using a test corpus of 30k words. 
We get about 1.0% increase of F-score after us-
ing the hybrid approach. The F-score is higher 
than F-score 87.75% of Chinese base NP chunk-
ing systems using the Maximum Entropy method 
in (Zhou et al, 2003),. Which used the smaller 3 
MB Penn Chinese Treebank II as the corpus.  
The Chinese Base NP chunkers are not supe-
rior to those for English. Zhang and Ando (2005) 
produce the best English base NP accuracy with 
F-score of 94.39+ (0.79), which is superior to our 
best results. The previous work mostly consid-
ered base NP chunking as the classification prob-
lem without special attention to the lexical 
information and syntactic dependence of words. 
On the other hand, we add some grammar rules 
to strength the syntactic dependence between the 
words. However, the syntactic structure derived 
from Chinese is much more flexible and complex 
than that from English. First, some Chinese 
words contain abundant meanings or play differ-
ent syntactic roles. For example, "?? (among 
which)/NN ? ? (Chongqing)/NR ? ?
(district)/NN" is recognized as a base NP. Actu-
91
ally the Chinese word ???/NN (among)? refers 
to the content in the previous sentence and ??? 
(thereinto)? sometimes used as an adverb. Sec-
ond, how to deal with the conjunctions is a major 
problem, especially the words ?? (and)? can 
appear in the preposition structure ?? ?? ?
? (relate to)?, which makes it difficult to judge 
those types of differences. Third, the chunkers 
can not handle with compact sequence data of 
chunks with name entities and new words (espe-
cially the transliterated words) satisfactorily, 
such as  
??? ( China ) /NR ????( Red Cross ) 
/NR?? ( Honorary ) /NN ?? (Chairman ) 
/NN ???( Jiang Ze-min ) /NR?  
As it points above, the English name entities 
sequences are connected with the conjunction 
such as ?of, and, in?. While in Chinese there are 
no such connection words for name entities se-
quences. Therefore when we use the statistical 
methods, those kinds of sequential chunks con-
tribute slightly to the feature selection and classi-
fier training, and are treated as the useless noise 
in the training data. In the testing section, it is 
close the separating margin and hardly deter-
mined to be in the right category. What?s more, 
some other factors such as Idiomatic and special-
ized expressions also account for the errors. By 
highlighting those kinds of words and using 
some rules which emphasize on those proper 
words, we use our error-pruning methods and 
useful grammar rules to correct about 60% errors.  
5 Conclusions  
This paper presented a new hybrid approach for 
identifying the Chinese base NPs. Our hybrid 
approach uses the SVM and CRF algorithm to 
design the preliminary classifiers for chunking. 
Furthermore with the direct comparison between 
the results from the former chunkers, we figure 
out that those two statistical methods are myopic 
about the compact chunking data of sequential 
noun. With the intention of capturing the syntac-
tic dependence within those sequential chunking 
data, we make use of the conditional probabili-
ties of the chunking tags given the corresponding 
tokens derived from CRF and some simple 
grammar rules to modify the preliminary results.  
The overall results achieve 89.27% precision 
on the base NP chunking. We attempt to explain 
some existing semantic problems and solve a 
certain part of problems, which have been dis-
covered and explained in the paper. Future work 
will concentrate on working out some adaptive 
machine learning methods to make grammar 
rules automatically, select better features and 
employ suitable classifiers for Chinese base NP 
chunking. Finally, the particular Chinese base 
phrase grammars need a complete study, and the 
approach provides a primary solution and 
framework to process an analyses and compari-
sons between Chinese and English parallel base 
NP chunkers.
