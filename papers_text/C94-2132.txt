1 INTII ,ODUCTION 
In order to construct systems wlfich can pro('css nat- 
ural language in a sophisticated fashion it is highly 
desirable to be able to rel)resent linguistic meanings 
in a comlmtationally tractable fashion. One a,ppro~ch 
to the problem of capturing meanings ~tt the lcxi<:al 
level is to use a form of distributed representation 
where each word meaning is converted into a point in 
an n-dimenskmal space (Sutcliffc, 1992a). Such rel)- 
resentations can capture a wide variety of word mean- 
ings within the same forlnalism. In addition they can 
be used within distributed representations \[br captur- 
ing higher level information such as that expressed I)y 
sentences (Sutcliffc, 1991a). Moreover, they can be 
scaled to suit a particular tradeoil" of speciticity and 
memory usage (Sutclilfi~, 1991b). Hnally, distributed 
representations can be processed conwmiently by vec- 
tor processing methods or connectionist algorithms 
and can be used either as part of a symbolic sys- 
tem (Sutclitl~, 1992b) or within a eonnectionist ar- 
chitecture (Sutcliffe, 1988). In previous work we have 
shown how such representations can be constructed 
automatically by the method of taxonomic tr~Lversal, 
using tire Merriam Webster Compact Electronic die-- 
tionary (Sutcliffe, 1993) ~md the Irish-Irish An Focldir 
Beag (Sutcliffe, McElligott and O Ndill, 1993). Ilow 
ever our efforts o far have I)een limited by our parsing 
technology to lexicons of a few thousand words. We 
describe here how we can gel|er;M,e a lexical entry for 
any of the 71,000 nouns 2 in the Princeton WordNet 
(Beckwith, Fetlbaum, (\]ross mM Miller, 1992), and 
the initial tests we have conducted on the representa- 
tions. 
Our method is closely related to other work which 
exploits the taxonomic nature of dictionary detini- 
tions (Amsler, 1980; Iliedorn, Byrd and (~hodorow, 
t986; Vossen, 1990; Guthrie, Slator, Wilks and I/ruce, 
1990; Nutter, Fox and Evens, 1990). In addition there. 
have already been some very interesting al)l)roaehes 
to the construction of distributed semantic represen- 
tations either from dicl, ionaries (Wilks el, el., t990) or 
fl'om corpora (Schuetze, 1993).

2 EXTRACTING FEATURE R,EPR,ESEN- 
TATIONS 
'l'he object of our work is to produce for each n()un 
sense in a lexicon a semantic reprcscntation consist. 
ing of a set of tim.lure-centrality p~firs. The lhatures 
are semantic attributes each of which says something 
about the concept being defined. 'Phe centrality as- 
sociated with each feature is ;u real mmd)er which in-- 
dicatcs how strongly the feature contributes to the 
meaning of the concept. The use of centralities allows 
us to distinguish I)etwecn important and less impor 
taut ti;atures in a semantic rel)resentation. By scaling 
the centralities in a particular noun-sense representa- 
tion so that tire stun of their squares is one we can 
use the (lot product ol)eration to compute the sen,an 
tic simila.rity of a pair of coneel)ts. A word COlnpared 
to itself always scores OlLe while a word compared to 
another word is always less than or equal to one. This 
is equivalent to saying that each word representation 
is a vector of length one in an n-dimensional space, 
where n is the nmnber of features which are used in 
the lexicon as a whole. 
Our algorithm for constructing the representations 
is based on two well-known observations. Firstly, a 
word definition in a dictionary provides attribute in- 
I'ormation about the COlmept ('a ilia.still' is a LAR(31'; 
dog'). Secondly a word delinition also provides tax(> 
nomic information about the concept ('a mastiff is i~ 
large DOG'). We use the former to derive attributes 
for our representation, and the latter to ol)tain other 
definitions higher up in the taxonomy from which fur-- 
ther attril)utes can be obtained. In assigning central 
ities to %aturcs, we use the same value for each at- 
tribute added at a particuli~r level in the taxonomic 
hierarchy, and we reduce the value used as we move 
u 1) to higher levels. This corresponds I,o the intuition 
that a feature which is derived from a delinitioa which 
is close to the word of interest in the taxonomy con 
tri/)utes more to its meaning than one which is derived 
from a more distanu detinition. 
The Princeton WordNet is very suitable lbr use in 
iml)lementing our extraction algorithm because taxo 
nomic links are represented explicitly by pointers. In 
most Ml{l)s such links have to be deduced by synta(> 
tic and semantic analysis of sense detinitions. Nouns 
in WoMNet are organised around synsels. I!;ach 
synset may inelmle a list of synonyms, pointers to 
hyponym and hypernym synsets, and a gloss con'e- 
sponding to a conventional dictionary definition.

The extraction algorithm starts with the synset cor- 
responding to the word-sense for which we wish to 
create a lexieal entry. 'l?he gloss is tokenised, function 
words are removed and tire relnaining content words 
are converted to their root railer(ion. All such words 
are considered to be real,ares of the word-sense, and 
are given a centrality of 1.0. We then chain at)war(Is 
using a hypernymic link (if any) 3. At the. next level 
up, features are extracted from the hypernym's gloss, 
nsing a centrality of 0.9. The process is repeated, re- 
ducing the centrality by 0.1 at each level, until either 
the top of tire hierarchy is reached or the centrality 
falls to zero. Finally, the rel)resentat.ion , consisting of 
a set of feature-centrality l)airs, is normalised. 
3 RESULTS 
The Mgorithm deseril)ed above has helm imt)hmmnted 
and can be used to construct a lexical entry for any of 
the nouns in the WordNet database. Figure 1 shows 
the synset hypernym hierarchy for tile word 'terrier' in 
WordNet. Figure 2 shows the semantic representation 
derived by the algorithm for this word. We present 
here some preliminary exl)eriments whic.h attempt o 
measure the performance of the lexicon. Four words 
were chosen fi'om each of live categories of noun wlfi('.h 
we label cars, clogs, /lowers, trees mid peol)le. These 
are shown in Table I. Talrle 2 shows a Slllllll/lary of 
tile characteristics of the word representations i  the 
set of twenty words. Pairs of categories were eho- 
soil, cars-dogs, flowers-trees al ld so ()\[1~ each contain- 
ing eight words. A series of eighl.-by-eight tables was 
then computed, showing the dot l)roduct of each word 
with every other word in the category pair. Table 3 
shows the results for the curs-dogs matrix. There are 
several points to note about this table. I:'irstly, the 
match of one car word with another is high, rang- 
ing between 0.58 and 1.0 with an average of 0.8. This 
shows that the lexicon has cal)tured the similarity be- 
tween the ear coneel)ts. Secon(lly, the match of one 
dog word with another is also high, ranging I)etwcen 
0.63 and 1.0 with an average of 0.76, for the same 
festoon. Thirdly, the lnateh of a car word with a clog 
word is low, ranging between 0.05 and 0.17 with an 
average of 0.t. This is heeause cars and dogs are 
not closely linke.d semantically. Tal)le 4 shows re- 
suits for the flowers-trees matrix. Flowers and trees 
are much more closely related semantically thau cars 
and dogs, and this is rellected in the results. Hower 
words match with tree words in a range of 0.30 to 0.67 
aAt. wesent, we only clmosc the firs(, such link if there are 
several. 
with an average of 0.4, n~mch igher than for cars m~d 
dogs. The match of flowers with tlowers or trees with 
trees continues to be high. Finally, Tabh; 5 shows the 
people-dogs matrix. Note here thai; the match of peo- 
ple with themselwes i lower than that of (logs with 
themselves (average 0.63 rather than average 0.76.) 
This is because tile people words are in fact a rather 
disparate set. Note in particular that 'bruiser' against 
'rake' is the best lnatch while 'bruiser' against 'patri- 
arch' is the worst. This matches one's intuitions abont 
these concepts:  patriarchs are "good" while 'hruisers' 
all(l q'akes' arc not. 
4 CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented a simph', algorithm which allows a 
set of distributed lexical semantir epresentations to 
be constructed from nouns in the Princeton WordNet. 
'\['he results how that the method works and produces 
good results. The main reason for this is the explicit 
taxonomic information in WordNet which has to be 
inferred in other dictionaries. Incorrect axonomic in- 
formation seriously degrades the pex\[brrnanee of this 
Idml of method. On the other hand errors in indi- 
vidual features arc not so harmful as they have. no 
knock on effects. Ilowever, we are engaged in elim- 
inating errors in word sense and syntactic category  
which are the princilml sources of inaccuracy in the 
method. In addi|;ion we a.re working on objective 
methods for nw.asl,ring the perfornmnce of the lexi- 
con on a large scale.
