Abstract
Evaluation often denotes a key issue in
semantics- or subjectivity-related tasks. Here
we discuss the difficulties of evaluating opin-
ionated keyphrase extraction. We present our
method to reduce the subjectivity of the task
and to alleviate the evaluation process and
we also compare the results of human and
machine-based evaluation.
1 Introduction
Evaluation is a key issue in natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) tasks. Although for more basic tasks
such as tokenization or morphological parsing, the
level of ambiguity and subjectivity is essentially
lower than for higher-level tasks such as question
answering or machine translation, it is still an open
question to find a satisfactory solution for the (auto-
matic) evaluation of certain tasks. Here we present
the difficulties of finding an appropriate way of eval-
uating a highly semantics- and subjectivity-related
task, namely opinionated keyphrase extraction.
There has been a growing interest in the NLP
treatment of subjectivity and sentiment analysis ?
see e.g. Balahur et al (2011) ? on the one hand and
on keyphrase extraction (Kim et al, 2010) on the
other hand. The tasks themselves are demanding for
automatic systems due to the variety of the linguis-
tic ways people can express the same linguistic con-
tent. Here we focus on the evaluation of subjective
information mining through the example of assign-
ing opinionated keyphrases to product reviews and
compare the results of human- and machine-based
evaluation on finding opinionated keyphrases.
2 Related Work
As the task we aim at involves extracting keyphrases
that are responsible for the author?s opinion toward
the product, aspects of both keyphrase extraction
and opinion mining determine our methodology and
evaluation procedure. There are several sentiment
analysis approaches that make use of manually an-
notated review datasets (Zhuang et al, 2006; Li
et al, 2010; Jang and Shin, 2010) and Wei and
Gulla (2010) constructed a sentiment ontology tree
in which attributes of the product and sentiments
were paired.
For evaluating scientific keyphrase extraction,
several methods have traditionally been applied. In
the case of exact match, the gold standard key-
words must be in perfect overlap with the ex-
tracted keywords (Witten et al, 1999; Frank et al,
1999) ? also followed in the SemEval-2010 task
on keyphrase extraction (Kim et al, 2010), while
in other cases, approximate matches or semanti-
cally similar keyphrases are also accepted (Zesch
and Gurevych, 2009; Medelyan et al, 2009). In this
work we applied the former approach for the evalu-
ation of opinion phrases and made a thorough com-
parison with the human judgement.
Here, we use the framework introduced in Berend
(2011) and conducted further experiments based on
it to point out the characteristics of the evaluation
of opinionated keyphrase extraction. Here we pin-
point the severe differences in performance mea-
sures when the output is evaluated by humans com-
pared to strict exact match principles and also exam-
ine the benefit of hand-annotated corpus as opposed
99
to an automatically crawled one. In addition, the
extent to which original author keyphrases resemble
those of independent readers? is also investigated in
this paper.
3 Methodology
In our experiments, we used the methodology de-
scribed in Berend (2011) to extract opinionated
keyphrase candidates from the reviews. The sys-
tem treats it as a supervised classification task us-
ing Maximum Entropy classifier, in which certain
n-grams of the product reviews are treated as classi-
fication instances and the task is to classify them as
proper or improper ones. It incorporates a rich fea-
ture set, relying on the usage of SentiWordNet (Esuli
et al, 2010) and further orthological, morphological
and syntactic features. Next, we present the diffi-
culties of opinionated keyphrase extraction and offer
our solutions to the emerging problems.
3.1 Author keyphrases
In order to find relevant keyphrases in the texts,
first the reviews have to be segmented into ana-
lyzable parts. We made use of the dataset de-
scribed in Berend (2011), which contains 2000 prod-
uct reviews each from two quite different domains,
i.e. mobile phone and video film reviews from the re-
view portal epinions.com. In the free-text parts
of the reviews, the author describes his subjective
feelings and views towards the product, and in the
sections Pros and cons and Bottomline he summa-
rizes the advantages and disadvantages of the prod-
uct, usually by providing some keyphrases or short
sentences. However, these pros and cons are noisy
since some authors entered full sentences while oth-
ers just wrote phrases or keywords. Furthermore,
the segmentation also differs from review to review
or even within the same review (comma, semicolon,
ampersand etc.). There are also non-informative
comments such as none among cons. For the above
reasons, the identification of the appropriate gold
standard phrases is not unequivocal.
We had to refine the pros and cons of the re-
views so that we could have access to a less noisy
database. Refinement included segmenting pros
and cons into keyphrase-like units and also bring-
ing complex phrases into their semantically equiva-

lent, yet much simpler forms, e.g. instead of ?even I
found the phones menus to be confusing?, we would
like to have ?confusing phones menus?. Refinement
was carried out both automatically by using hand-
crafted transformation rules (based on POS patterns
and parse trees) and manual inspection. The an-
notation guidelines for the human refinement and
various statistics on the dataset can be accessed at
http://rgai.inf.u-szeged.hu/proCon.
3.2 Annotator keyphrases
The second problem with regard to opinionated
keyphrase extraction is the subjectivity of the task.
Different people may have different opinions on the
very same product, which is often reflected in their
reviews. On the other hand, people can gather dif-
ferent information from the very same review due
to differences in interpretation, which again compli-
cates the way of proper evaluation.
In order to evaluate the difficulty of identifying
opinion-related keyphrases, we decided to apply the
following methodology. We selected 25 reviews re-
lated to the mobile phone Nokia 6610, which were
also collected from the website epinions.com.
The task for three linguists was to write positive
and negative aspects of the product in the form of
keyphrases, similar to the original pros and cons. In
order not to be influenced by the keyphrases given
by the author of the review, the annotators were only
given the free-text part of the review, i.e. the origi-
nal Pros and cons and Bottomline sections were re-
moved. In this way, three different pro and con an-
notations were produced for each review, besides,
those of the original author were also at hand. The
inter-annotator agreement rate is in Table 1.
Concerning the subjectivity of the task, pro and
con phrases provided by the three annotators and

the original author showed a great degree of variety
although they had access to the very same review.
Sometimes it happened that one annotator did not
give any pro or con phrases for a review whereas the
others listed a bunch of them, which reflects that the
very same feature can be judged as still tolerable,
neutral or absolutely negative for different people.
Thus, as even human annotations may differ from
each other to a great extent, it is not unequivocal to
decide which human annotation should be regarded
as the gold standard upon evaluation.
3.3 Evaluation methodology
Since the comparison of annotations highlighted
the subjectivity of the task, we voted for smooth-
ing the divergences of annotations. We wanted to
take into account all the available annotations which
were manually prepared and regarded as acceptable.
Thus, an annotator formed the union and the inter-
section of the pro and con features given by each an-
notator either including or excluding those defined
by the original author. With this, we aimed at elim-
inating subjectivity since in the case of union, every
keyphrase mentioned by at least one annotator was
taken into consideration while in the case of inter-
section, it is possible to detect keyphrases that seem
to be the most salient for the annotators as regards
the given document. Thus, four sets of pros and cons
were finally yielded for each review depending on
whether the unions or intersections were determined
purely on the phrases of the annotators excluding the
original phrases of the author or including them. The
following example illustrates the way new sets were
created based on the input sets (in italics):
Pro1 : radio, organizer, phone book
Pro2 : radio, organizer, loudspeaker
Pro3 : radio, organizer, calendar
Union: radio, organizer, calendar, loud-
speaker, phone book
Intersection: radio, organizer
Proauthor : clear, fun
Merged Union: radio, organizer, calen-
dar, loudspeaker, phone book, clear, fun
Merged Intersection: ?
The reason behind this methodology was that it
made it possible to evaluate our automatic meth-
ods in two different ways. Comparing the automatic
keyphrases to the union of human annotations means
that a bigger number of keyphrases is to be identi-
fied, however, with a bigger number of gold standard
keywords it is more probable that the automatic key-
words occur among them. At the same time having a
larger set of gold standard tags might affect the recall
negatively since there are more keyphrases to return.
On the other hand, in the case of intersection it can
be measured whether the most important features
(i.e. those that every annotator felt relevant) can be
extracted from the text. Note that our strategy is sim-
ilar to the one applied in the case of BLEU/ROUGE
score (Papineni et al, 2002; Lin, 2004) with respect
to the fact that multiple good solutions are taken
into account whereas the application of union and
intersection is determined by the nature of the task:
different annotators may attach several outputs (in
other words, different numbers of keyphrases) to the
same document in the case of keyphrase extraction,
which is not realistic in the case of machine trans-
lation or summarization (only one output is offered
for each sentence / text).
3.4 Results
In our experiments, we used the opinion phrase ex-
traction system based on the paper of Berend (2011).
Results vary whether the manually or the automat-
ically refined set of the original sets of pros and
cons were regarded as positive training examples
and also whether the evaluation was carried out

against purely the original set of author-assigned
keyphrases or the intersection/union of the man-
ual annotations including and excluding the author-
assigned keyphrases on the 25 mobile phone re-
views. Results of the various combinations in the
experiments for the top 5, 10 and 15 keyphrases
are reported in Table 2 containing both cases when
human and automatic refinement of the gold stan-
dard opinion phrases were carried out. Automatic
keyphrases were manually compared to the above
mentioned sets of keyphrases, i.e. human annotators
judged them as acceptable or not. Human evaluation
had the advantage over automated ones, that they
could accept the extracted term ?MP3? when there
was only its mistyped version ?MP+? in the set of
gold standard phrases (as found in the dataset).
Table 3 presents the results of our experiments on
keyphrase refinement on the mobiles and movies do-
mains. In these settings strict matches were required
instead of human evaluation. Results differ with re-
spect to the fact whether the automatically or manu-
ally refined sets of the original author phrases were
utilized for training and during the strict evaluation.
Having conducted these experiments, we could ex-
amine the possibility of a fully automatic system that
needs no manually inspected training data, but it can
create it automatically as well.
4 Discussion and conclusions
Both human and automatic evaluation reveal that
the results yielded when the system was trained on
manually refined keyphrases are better. The usage
of manually refined keyphrases as the training set
leads to better results (the difference being 5.9 F-
score on average), which argues for human annota-
tion as opposed to automatic normalization of the
gold standard opinion phrases. Note, however, that
even though results obtained with the automatic re-
finement of training instances tend to stay below the
results that are obtained with the manual refinement
of gold standard phrases, they are still comparable,
which implies that with more sophisticated rules,
training data could be automatically generated.
If the inter-annotator agreement rates are com-
pared, it can be seen that the agreement rates be-
tween the annotators are considerably higher than
those between a linguist and the author of the prod-
uct review. This may be due to the fact that the
linguists were to conform to the annotation guide-
lines whereas the keyphrases given by the authors
of the reviews were not limited in any way. Still,
it can be observed that among the author-annotator
agreement rates, the con phrases could reach higher
agreement than the pro phrases. This can be due to
psychological reasons: people usually expect things
to be good hence they do not list all the features that
are good (since they should be good by nature), in
contrast, they list negative features because this is
what deviates from the normal expectations.
In this paper, we discussed the difficulties of eval-
uating opinionated keyphrase extraction and also
conducted experiments to investigate the extent of
overlap between the keyphrases determined by the
original author of a review and those assigned by
independent readers. To reduce the subjectivity of
the task and to alleviate the evaluation process, we
presented our method that employs several indepen-
dent annotators and we also compared the results of
human and machine-based evaluation. Our results
reveal that for now, human evaluation leads to bet-
ter results, however, we believe that the proper treat-
ment of polar expressions and ambiguous adjectives
might improve automatic evaluation among others.
Besides describing the difficulties of the auto-
matic evaluation of opinionated keyphrase extrac-
tion, the impact of training on automatically crawled
gold standard opinionated phrases was investigated.
Although not surprisingly they lag behind the ones
obtained based on manually refined training data,
the automatic creation of gold standard keyphrases
can be a much cheaper, yet feasible option to manu-
ally refined opinion phrases. In the future, we plan to
reduce the gap between manual and automatic eval-
uation of opinionated keyphrase extraction.
