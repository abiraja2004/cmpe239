Abst rac t  
Word Identification has been an important and ac- 
tive issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing. 
In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept 
of sublanguage, is proposed for identifying unknown 
words, especially personal names, in Chinese newspa- 
pers. The proposed mechanism includes title.driven 
name recognition, adaptive dynamic word formation, 
identification of Z-character and 3-character Chinese 
names without title. We will show the e~:perimental 
results for two corpora and compare them with the re- 
sults by the NTIIU's statistic-based system, the only 
system that we know has attacked the same problem. 
The ezperimental results have shown significant im- 
provements over the WI systems without the name 
identification capability. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Word Identification (WI, also known as Segmenta- 
tion) has been an important and active issue ill 
Chinese Natural Language Processing. Various ap- 
proaches are proposed for this problem \[1\], such as 
MM (Maximum Matclfing) method \[8\], RMM (Re- 
verse Directional Maximum Matching) metlmd, OM 
(Optimum Matching) method, statistical approaches 
\[5\], and unification approaches \[12\]. lIowever, there 
are still a number of problems to conquer towards a 
satisfactory WI system. Among them are a clear defi- 
nition of Chinese words, an objective valuation suite 
with appropriate corpora, and the processing of un- 
known words (such as personal names, place names, 
and organization ames). 
In this paper, we will deal with the problem of un- 
known words, especially personal names, althougii the 
proposed approach can be easily extended to cover 
place nantes and organization antes. According to 
Chang, et al \[2\], proper nouns (which compose a ma- 
jor part of unknown words) account for more than 
fifty percent of errors made by a typical system. Thus, 
successful processing of proper nouns is essential for 
a satisfactory WI system. 
Almost all WI systems use a lexicon to guide the 
segmentation process. In fixed domains such as a 
classical novel or technical texts, we can put all pos- 
sible words in the lexicon and avoid the unknown- 
word problem. However, in a dynamic domain such 
as newspapers, it is impossible to enumerate all pos- 
sible words in advance. For example, some personal 
names, such as suspects or victims , often appear in 
only one day's news. Thus, recognition of these per- 
sonal names and other unknown words is very impor- 
tant. 
Chang, et al \[2\] (at National Tsing-Hua Univer- 
sity, ttsinchu, Taiwan) proposed a Multiple-Corpus 
approach to solve the problem. They consider the WI 
problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) 
and use a number of corpora to train their statistic- 
based system. The probabilities of each Chinese char- 
acter as a surnanm, the first character and the second 
character in a first name are computed based on the 
training. Using these statistics, two-character and 
three.character personal names are proposed to com- 
pete with the words in the lexicon. Then, a dynamic 
programming technique is used to decide the most 
probable solution to the CSP. They reported a 90 
percent average correct rate of surname-name identi- 
fication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only 
group that has proposed a solution to the problem. 
Chang's approach is completely statistic-based and 
easy-to-implenmnt. However, we argue that syntactic 
and semantic information must be considered in a 
successfid WI system. 
2 A Sub language Approach  
The concept of sublanguages (i.e., languages in re- 
stricted domains) has been considered very important 
in natural anguage processing \[6, 7\]. A sublanguage 
usually has its own special syntax, semantics, and 
style, which are more restricted comparing with the 
language as a whole. In this paper, we will show how 
the study of a sublanguage can help identifying names 
and forming them in a dynamic, adaptive way. 
2.1 Observation 
From the United News, one of the most popular daily 
newspapers in Taiwan, we have acquired a news- 
paper corpus of more than one million characters. 
This corpus has been used for building our lexicon, 
computing statistics, and testing our WI systems 
for spell-checking, preprocessing for speech synthesis, 
Ac'lXS DE COLING-92. NAN'r~, 23-28 AOtrr 1992 1 2 3 9 FROC. OF COLING-92. NANTES. AtrG. 23-28, 1992 
and phoneme-to-word conversion. 
After studying the segmentation output of the 
newspaper corpus, we observed that (1) unknown 
words are mostly personal names (translation ames 
or otherwise), place names, and organization ames 
in addition to those words that should have been built 
in the lexicon (a similar conclusion was obtained by 
Chang's papers); aud (2) when a personal name ap- 
pears the first time, it is usually accompanied with 
a title (such as taibel shizhang ~:~b~:~ Taipei 
mayor} or a role noun (such as jizhe \]~ ~ reporter, 
houxianren It~j~,~. candidate). 
From these observations, we propose the following 
mechanisms to help identifying unknown words in the 
WI process: (1) title-driven ame recognition and (2) 
adaptive dynamic word tbrmation. 
2.2 Title-driven Name Recognition 
As we mentioned above, it is not plausible to put all 
proper names in the lexicon for a dynamic domain 
such as news articles. Since a new personal name 
usually appears with a title or a role noun, we can 
use the clue to design a set of word formation rules 
in our parsing-based WI system \[11\] (s~ the next 
section). Part  of the set of rules in augmented CFG 
format are : 
<name> ~-- <tit le> <last> <first> 
{ Build <last> <first> as a name ) 
<nurse> ~- <last> <first> <tit le> 
{ Build <last> <first> as a name ) 
<tit le> +- <word> 
{ Test if <word> is'a title } 
<last> ~ <word> 
{ Test if <word> is a surnanae ) 
<first> *-- <word> 
{ "lest if <word> is 1- or 2-char } 
<first> ~- <word> <word> 
{ Test if both <word> are 1-char } 
A Chinese name usually consists of two to four 
characters: one- or two-character surname and one- 
or two-character fi st name. Furthermore, surnames 
are among a limited set. Thus, in rule 4, the aug- 
mented part is just a membership test. We can store 
the surname information as a feature in the \[exical 
entries. Similarly, we have title and r~ole features 
in the lexicon for rule 3. Note that in the current 
design, translation ames of foreigners and husband 
surname prefixing of married women can not be cor- 
rectly identified. However, this approach works for 
eomanon persoual names that occupy a major part of 
unknown words. 
2.3 Adaptive Dynamic Word Forma- 
tion 
After a new personal name is recognized through the 
set of rules described above, the system will dynam- 
ically build a lexical entry for it. Thus, if the name 
appears in later sentences in the news article, it can 
be correctly identified. 
In Figure 1 is an example for adaptive dy- 
namic word formation. In the article, there are 
four Chinese names: ni2 shu2 yah2 ~ (4 in- 
stances), ye4 yingl hao2 ~ ' I~  (1 instance), eai4 
jial tlng2 ~ (4 instances), and wu2 xun2 long2 
~:~ (1 iustance). In first instances, all four 
names come with a title: lao3shil ~ (teacher), 
ji4zhe3 \ ]~ (reporter), er2tong2 ~ (child), and 
jian3cha2guanl ~i~'E" (prosecutor). Since the 
names are built in the lexicon dynamically, the other 
instances of the names can be identified with higher 
scores than names without title. In other words, the 
names with title are built with much more confidence. 
2 .4  Names  w i thout  T i t le  
In addition to the names with title or role, the other 
personal names are proposed through a surname- 
driven rule. In other words, when the WI system 
meets a surname word, a personal name proposing 
rule is invoked although its preference score would be 
much lower than regular words and names with title. 
2.5 Place Names and Organization 
Names 
The proposed mechanism can be extended to cover 
place names and organization ames. Just llke per- 
sonal names appear with title, place names can be 
identified through the unit such as xian ~ (county), 
shi i~i (city), jie ff~ (street), lu t~ (road), etc. Simi- 
larly, organization names can be identified by the type 
such as gongsi /C~ (company), bu n\[~ (department 
or ministry), ke ~ (section), and so on. This part 
has not yet implemented in our system. 
3 The System 
Since July 1986, we have been involved in developing 
a series of Chinese-related NLP systems,'including an 
English-Chinese MT system, a Japanese-Chinese MT, 
a Chinese Word Knowledge Base, a Chinese Parser, 
and a Chinese Spell-Checker. tIere, we will only 
briefly describe the Chinese WI system as a frontend 
for the Chinese Parser. For more details, the reader 
is referred to Wang, et al \[11\]. 
We consider the WI process as a parsing process 
with word composition grammar, instead of a CSP 
problem \[2\], a unification problem \[12\] . . . .  scanning 
process. A set of Chinese word composition gram- 
mar rules are designed to capture the characteris- 
tics of Chinese words. The grammar epresentation 
is Augmented CFG which is also used to write the 
English grammar in our English-Chinese MT system. 
The parser we used is based on Tomita's Generalized 
LR Parser \[10\]. Itowever, the augmented parts (tests 
and actions) and preference scoring module have been 
added.

Figure 1: An Example for Adaptive Dynamic Word Formation 
Ill the WI process, the basic unit is a character. 
A Chinese word is composed of one to five (may be 
longer) characters. 
The WI system consists of a lexicon, the word com- 
position grammar, the preference scoring module, the 
test functions, and the parser. 
The lexicon contains a list of Chinese words (sorted 
by the internal code order) with the following infor- 
mation: the characters from wblch the word is com- 
posed, its frequency count, its part of speech, and 
some semantic features (such as title, surname, and 
role). The lexicon is a general purpose one; that is, 
it is built independent of the testing corpora. Cur- 
rently, there are more than 90,000 lexical entries in 
the lexicon. 
A rule in the word grammar consists of a context- 
free part and an augmented part. Iq addition to the 
unknown word identification described in the previ- 
ous section, augmented parts are used for recognizing 
(1) replication of words; (2) nmnbers; (3) prefixe~; 
(4) suffixes; and (5) the determiner measure construc- 
tions. 
Since the word parser would produce two or more 
parses for an ambiguous sentence, a preference scor- 
ing module has been designed to choose the correct 
parse. Currently, the preference score is assigned 
based on (1) the length of the word (longer words 
are preferred), (2) the frequency count, and (3) se- 
mantic consideration ( e.g., three-character personal 
names are preferred to two-character ones). The WI 
system is written in Common Lisp, running on a TI 
Micro-Explorer machine. 
4 Experimental Results 
Before we present he experimental results, two per- 
formance indices, recall rate and precision rate, of a 
WI system are defined below following Sproat and 
Shih \[9\] and Chang, et al \[3\]. Let C be the segmen- 
tation results hy the computer, H the results by the 
human (the correct results), and I the intersection of 
C and II. Then, recall rate is I divided by tI, and pre- 
cision rate I divided by C. Fo~" example, if there are 20 
words in a sentence (i.e., H equals 20), the WI system 
produces 22 words for the sentence (i.e., C equals 22), 
and there are 18 words m common (i.e., I equals 18), 
tile recall rate would be 0.90 and the precision rate 
0.82. 
To demonstrate tile proposed mechanism, we have 
tested the W\[ system with two corpora: (1) ten arti- 
cles from a newspaper corpus, the United Daily cor- 
pus, (2) 61 sentences from Chang et al \[4\]. The first 
corpus is selected from the United Daily on March 8, 
1991. The selection criterion is that the article does 
not contain any table or figure and, preferably, con- 
tains Chinese names. The second corpus is composed 
of difficult cases for which the NTHU WI system ei- 
ther can not identify the names or overgenerates some 
Chinese names. 
In the experiment, we use four versions of the WI 
system to segment he ten articles. Version 1 is the 
WI system without name recognition capability, Ver- 
sion 2 the system recognizing only names with title, 
Version 3 the system recognizing both names with 
title and 3-character names, and Version 4 also rec- 
ognizing 2-character names. 
Recall rates (RR) and precision rates (PK) are com- 
puted automatically by comparing the segmentation 
output with the correct answers egmented by human. 
The experinmntal results are summarized in Table 1. 
From the table, we can observe the following facts: 
1. Version 2 (It~:96.17, PR:93.46) has a signif- 
icant improvement over Version 1 (RI~:94.77, 
PR:89.28). In other words, the capability for 
name recognition is very important in a WI sys- 
tem. Although Version '2 only has a limited capa- 
bility (for names with title), the improvement is 
rather apparent. Note that in Version 2, the dy- 
namic word formation mechanism is much more 
useful than in Version 3 or 4. 
2. Version 3 has the best results (RR.:97.51, 
PR.:98.19) among the four versions. It is better 
titan Version 2 for tile obvious reason: the capa- 
bility for identifying 3-character names without 
title. 
3. Although Version 4 has one more function, iden- 
tification of 2-character names without title, 
than Version 3, the result (ITK:96.32, PR:97.51) 
is slightly worse than Version 3. This is mainly

corpus 
because the gain (recognition of 2-character 
names) is less than the loss (misintepreting 2 
single-character words as a 2-character name). 
4. We will analyze the imperfections by the WI sys- 
tem in a subsection after the comparison with 
NTIIU's system. 
Compar i son  w i th  NTHU's  System 
In Chang, et al \[4\], which we will call NTHU's sys- 
tem, they reported a 95 percent precision rate and a 
recall rate greater than 95 percent, and listed 5 sam- 
plea (A-samples) the name in which their system can 
identify correctly, 34 examples (B-samples) for which 
the names are missed, and 22 examples (C-samples) 
for which Chinese names are over-generated. Among 
them, we found 3 A-samples, 6 B-samples, and 3 
C-samples contain personal names with title. Since 
NTHU's system is completely statistic-based, it can 
not make use of the title information. On the other 
hand, our sublanguage-based system would process 
these samples correctly. 
These 61 examples are fed to our WI system for 
comparison of the name recognition algorithms. The 
following results are for reference only, since the com- 
parison is rather unfair (the examples are mostly the 
eases their system can not recognize correctly). 
1. For the 5 A-samples, our system can recognize 
four of them. The only A-sample it failed to 
identify is: huang2 rong2 you2 you2 de0 dao4 
jli ~ ~ ~ ~ il~ . Our segmentation result is 
huang2-rong2-you2 you2 deO dao4, while the cor- 
rect result is huang2-rong2 you2-you2 de0 dao4. 
The reason is (l) our lexicon does not have the 
adverb you2-you2, and (2) we prefer 3-character 
names over 2-character ones. Note that NTHU's 
system can process all 5 cases successfully. 
2. For the 34 B-samples, our system can identify 
25 of them correctly. That  is, there are 9 B- 
samples the names in which both our system and 
NTHU's system can not identify. We will discuss 
the reasons why these cases can not be recognized 
in the next subsection. 
3. For the 22 C-samples for which NTHU's system 
overgenerates personal names, our system has 
processed 16 of them correctly. We will discuss 
the reasons in the next section why our system 
also overgenerates personal names for the other 
6 C-samples. 
4. For these 61 samples, our system can process 45 
of them correctly. 
Some Imper fect ions  
There are still some problems remained unsolved in 
our WI system. Some are problems for WI systems in 
general. 'rite others are specific to name recognition 
systems only. 
1. Two-character names are difficult to recognize, 
especially when followed by a single-character 
word. For example, in yil jing4 gangl ha3 fa3 
bao3 qu3 chul ~1~1\ ]~,~\ ]~ , yil- 
jing4 is a 2-chaxacter name. However, our WI 
system produces a 3-character name yil-jing4- 
gangl, since gangl (just) is a single character 
word. Although human usually can identify the 
names correctly by context, our Wl  system pro- 
posed the 3-character names understandably. 
2. The name of a maffied woman is usually pre- 
fixed with her husband's urname. Thus, a 3- 
character name would become 4-character, i.e., 
husband's urname, father's surname, and a 2- 
character given name, e.g., xu3 lin2 yah2 mei2 
~ 1 ~  . Currently, this kind of names 
cannot be identified correctly, although a word- 
grammar ule can be easily added. 
3. Some single-character surnames, such as lisa2 
(year), tangl ~ (soup), ceng2 ~ (once), and 
husng2 ~ (yellow), are common single-character 
words. Thus, the name recognition algorithm 
sometimes overgenerates a personal name by 
ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES. 23-28 AOt)r 1992 1 2 4 2 Paoc. OF COLING-92. NANTES, AUG. 23-28. 1992 
combining one such word with two following 
characters. 
4. Some surnames are rather unusual, such as 
lian ~ (lotus), ping2 ~ (duckweed), and que4 
(but). This would make the names not recog- 
nizable. There is a tradeoff between a complete 
surname list and a minimal common surname 
list. On the one end, a complete surname list 
would help name recognition but it helps over- 
generation as well. On the other end, a minimal 
list would limit the overgeneratiou while missing 
some would-be names. 
5. Some single-character words are very difficult 
to identify when they can be grouped as two- 
character words with the characters in the neigh- 
bout. A famous example is ba3 shou3 ~ (a 
handle). The problem is very difficult to solve 
for any WI systems. 
6. Even when the title information is used, overgen- 
eration of personal names is still hard to avoid. 
In the following is one of such examples: 
? yao l  qlng3 tai2 hal3 di4 fang1 fa3 yuan4 
zhangl lu3 xue2 jian3 eha3 guanl tan2 yao4 
wu4 lan4 yong4 wen4 ti2. 
Both the correct name zhangl-lu3-xue2 
~\[~Jl~ and an overgenerated name tan2-yao4- 
wu4 1 ~  are produced by our system. A 
fine adjustment of the scoring fnnctiou should be 
able to overcome this problem. However, there 
are so many similar problems uch that it would 
be a real problem when we develop a full-scale 
system. 
7. In Version 4 of our system, 2-character names 
without title are recognized in addition to those 
of Version 3, i.e., names with title and 3- 
character names without title. However, both 
the recall rate and precision rate of Version 4 are 
lower than those of Version 3. The major reason 
is that too many 2-character names are gener- 
ated. 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have proposed a new mechanism 
for identifying unknown words, especially personal 
names, in Chinese newspapers. The proposed mecha- 
nism includes title-driven ame recognition, adaptive 
dynamic word formation, identification of 2-character 
and 3-character Chinese names without title. We 
have also shown the experinmntal results for two cor- 
pora and have compared them with the results by the 
NTHU's WI system. 
Although there are still some problems remained 
unsolved (as discussed above), the experimental re- 
sults have shown significant improvements over the 
WI systems without the name identification capabil- 
ity.
