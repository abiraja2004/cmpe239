Abstract 
The probabilistic relation between verbs and 
their arguments plays an important role in 
modern statistical parsers and supertaggers, 
and in psychological theories of language 
processing. But these probabilities are 
computed in very different ways by the two 
sets of researchers. Computational linguists 
compute verb subcategorization probabilities 
from large corpora while psycholinguists 
compute them from psychological studies 
(sentence production and completion tasks). 
Recent studies have found differences 
between corpus frequencies and 
psycholinguistic measures. We analyze 
subcategorization frequencies from four 
different corpora: psychological sentence 
production data (Connine t al. 1984), written 
text (Brown and WSJ), and telephone 
conversation data (Switchboard). We find 
two different sources for the differences. 
Discourse influence is a result of how verb 
use is affected by different discourse types 
such as narrative, connected iscourse, and 
single sentence productions. Semantic 
influence is a result of different corpora using 
different senses of verbs, which have different 
subcategorization frequencies. We conclude 
that verb sense and discourse type play an 
important role in the frequencies observed in 
different experimental and corpus based 
sources of verb subcategorization frequencies. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The probabilistic relation between verbs and their 
arguments plays an important role in modern 
statistical parsers and supertaggers (Charniak 
1995, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi and Srinivas 1994, 
Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell 1997, Stolcke et al 
1997), and in psychological theories of language 
processing (Clifton et al 1984, Ferfeira & 
McClure 1997, Gamsey et al 1997, Jurafsky 1996, 
MacDonald 1994, Mitchell & Holmes 1985, 
Tanenhaus et al 1990, Trueswell et al 1993). 
These probabilities are computed in very different 
ways by the two sets of researchers. 
Psychological studies use methods such as 
sentence completion and sentence production for 
collecting verb argument structure probabilities. 
In sentence completion, subjects are asked to 
complete a sentence fragment. Garnsey at al. 
(1997) used a proper name followed by a verb, 
such as "Debbie remembered ." In 
sentence subjects are asked to write any sentence 
containing a given verb. An example of this type 
of study is Connine t al. (1984). 
An alternative to these psychological methods is 
to use corpus data. This can be done 
automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and 
Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al 1993), 
from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al's (1993) 
Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually 
as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and 
Grishman 1994). The advantage of any of these 
corpus methods is the much greater amount of 
data that can be used, and the much more natural 
contexts. This seems to make it preferable to 
data generated in psychological studies. 
Recent studies (Merlo 1994, Gibson et al 1996) 
have found differences between corpus 
frequencies and experimental measures. This 
suggests that corpus-based frequencies and 
experiment-based frequencies may not be 
interchangeable. To clarify the nature of the 
differences between various corpora and to find 
the causes of these differences, we analyzed 
1122 
psychological sentence production data (Connine 
etal.  1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ 
from Penn Treebank - Marcus et al 1993), and 
conversational data (Switchboard - Godfrey et al 
1992). We found that the subcategorization 
frequencies in each of these sources are different. 
We performed three experiments to (1) find the 
causes of general differences between corpora, (2) 
measure the size of these differences, and (3) find 
verb specific differences. The rest of this paper 
describes our methodology and the two sources of 
subcategorization probability differences: 
discourse influence and semantic influence. 
2 Methodology 
For the sentence production data, we used the 
numbers published in the original Connine et al 
paper as well as the original data, which we were 
able to review thanks to the generosity of Charles 
Clifton. The Connine data (CFJCF) consists of 
examples of 127 verbs, each classified as 
belonging to one of 15 subcategorization frames. 
We added a 16th category for direct quotations 
(which appeared in the corpus data but not the 
Connine data). Examples of these categories, 
taken from the Brown Corpus, appear in figure 1 
below. There are approximately 14,000 verb 
tokens in the CFJCF data set. 
For the BC, WSJ, and SWBD data, we counted 
subcategorizations using tgrep scripts based on the 
Penn Treebank. We automatically extracted and 
categorized all examples of the 127 verbs used in 
the Cormine study. We used the same verb 
subcategorization categories as the Connine study. 
There were approximately 21,000 relevant verb 
tokens in the Brown Corpus, 25,000 relevant verb

Figure 1 - examples of each subcategorization frame from Brown Corpus 
1123 
tokens in the Wall Street Journal Corpus, and 
10,000 in Switchboard. Unlike the Connine data, 
where all verbs were equally represented, the 
frequencies of each verb in the corpora varied. 
For each calculation where individual verb 
frequency could affect the outcome, we 
normalized for frequency, and eliminated verbs 
with less than 50 examples. This left 77 out of 
127 verbs in the Brown Corpus, 74 in the Wall 
Street Journal, and only 30 verbs in Switchboard. 
This was not a problem with the Connine data 
where most verbs had approximately 100 tokens. 
3 Exper iment  1 
The purpose of the first experiment is to analyze 
the general (non-verb-specific) differences 
between argument structure frequencies in the 
data sources. In order to do this, the data for each 
verb in the corpus was normalized to remove the 
effects of verb frequency. The average 
frequency of each subcategorization frame was 
calculated for each corpus. The average 
frequencies for each of the data sources were then 
compared. 
3.1 Resu l ts  
We found that the three corpora consisting of 
connected discourse (BC, WSJ, SWBD) shared a 
common set of differences when compared to the 
CFJCF sentence production data. There were 
three general categories of differences between the 
corpora, and all can be related to discourse type. 
These categories are: 
(1) passive sentences 
(2) zero anaphora 
(3) quotations 
3.1.1 Passive Sentences 
The CFJCF single sentence productions had the 
smallest number of passive sentences. The 
connected spoken discourse in Switchboard had 
more passives, followed by the written discourse 
in the Wall Street Journal and the Brown Corpus. 
Data Source 
CFJCF 
Switchboard 2.2% 
Wall Street Journal 6.7% 
Brown Corpus 
% passive sentences 
0.6% 
7.8% 
Passive is generally used in English to emphasize 
the undergoer (to keep the topic in subject 
position) and/or to de-emphasize the identity of 
the agent (Thompson 1987). Both of these 
reasons are affected by the type of discourse. If 
there is no preceding discourse, then there is no 
pre-existing topic to keep in subject position. In 
addition, with no context for the sentence, there is 
less likely to be a reason to de-emphasize the 
agent of the sentence. 
3.1.2 Zero Anaphora 
The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly 
mentioning understood arguments) is caused by 
two factors. Generally, as the amount of 
surrounding context increases (going from single 
sentence to connected iscourse) the need to 
overtly express all of the arguments with a verb 
decreases. 
Data Source % \[0\] subcat frame 
CFJCF 7% 
Wall Street Journal 8% 
Brown 13 % 
Switchboard 18 % 
Verbs that can describe actions (agree, disappear, 
escape, follow, leave, sing, wait) were typically 
used with some form of argument in single 
sentences, uch as: 
"I had a test that day, so I really wanted to escape 
from school." (CFJCF data). 
Such verbs were more likely to be used without 
any arguments in connected discourse as in: 
"She escaped , crawled through the usual mine 
fields, under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a 
river, and we finally picked her up in Linz." 
(Brown Corpus) 
In this case, the argument of "escaped", 
("imprisonment") was understood from the 
previous sentence. Verbs of propositional 
attitude (agree, guess, know, see, understand) are 
typically used transitively in written corpora and 
single-sentence production: 
"I guessed the right answer on the quiz." 
(CFJCF). 
In spoken discourse, these verbs are more likely to 
be used metalinguistically, with the previous 
1124 
discourse contribution understood as the argument 
of the verb: 
"I see." (Switchboard) 
"I guess." (Switchboard) 
3.1.3 Quotaa'ons 
Quotations are usually used in narrative, which is 
more likely in connected iscourse than in an 
isolated sentence. This difference mainly effects 
verbs of communication (e.g. answer, ask, call, 
describe, read, say, write). 
Data Source 
CFJCF 
Switchboard 0% 
Brown 4% 
Wall Street Journal 6% 
Percent Direct 
Quotation 
0% 
These verbs are used in corpora to discuss details 
of the contents of communication: 
"Turning to the reporters, she asked, "Did you 
hear her?"'(Brown) 
In single sentence production, they are used to 
describe the (new) act of communication itself ? 
"He asked a lot of questions at school." (CFJCF) 
We are currently working on systematically 
identifying indirect quotes in the corpora and the 
CFJCF data to analyze in more detail how they fit 
in to this picture. 
4 Exper iment  2 
Our first experiment 
factors were the 
suggested that discourse 
primary cause of 
subcategorization differences. One way to test 
this hypothesis is to eliminate discourse factors 
and see if this removes subcategorization 
differences. 
We measure the difference between the way a verb 
is used in two different corpora by counting the 
number of sentences (per hundred) where a verb in 
one corpus would have to be used with a different 
subcategorization in order for the two corpora to 
yield the same subcategorization frequencies. 
This same number can also be calculated for the 
overall subcategorization frequencies of two 
corpora to show the overall difference between the 
two corpora. 
Our procedure for measuring the effect of 
discourse is as follows (illustrated using passive 
as an example): 
1. Measure the difference between two corpora 
WSJ vs CFJCF) 
100  [owsJ I 
5.0% []CFJCF[ 
0.0% 
% Passive - WSJ vs CFJCF 
2. Remove differences caused by discourse 
effects (based on BC vs CFJCF). CFJCF has 
22% the number of passives that BC has. 
 iii!!!iiii!i iiiiiii) 
0%,m 
r'IBC I 
[ ]CFJCFI  
% Passive - BC vs CFJCF 
We then linearly scale the number of passives 
found in WSJ to reflect the difference found 
between BC and CFJCF. 
 00  !tiiii!iiiiiiiiii!tiiii)iiiiiiiiiiiiiii) 
5.0% 
0 .0%~ ......... 
r'lWSJ- 
mapped 
[] CFJCF 
% Passive - WSJ (adjusted) vs CFJCF 
3. re-measure the difference between two 
corpora (WSJ vs CFJCF) 
4. amount of improvement = size of discourse 
effect 
This method was applied to the passive, quote, 
and zero subcat frames, since these are the ones 
that show discourse-based differences. Before 
1125 
the mapping, WSJ has a difference of 17 
frames/100 overall difference when compared 
with CFJCF. After the mapping, the difference 
is only 9.6 frames/100 overall difference. This 
indicates that 43% of the overall cross-verb 
differences between these two corpora are caused 
by discourse ffects. 
We use this mapping procedure to measure the 
size and consistency of the discourse ffects. A 
more sophisticated mapping procedure would be 
appropriate for other purposes ince the verbs with 
the best matches between corpora are actually 
made worse by this mapping procedure. 
5 Experiment 3 
Argument preference was also affected by verb 
semantics. To examine this effect, we took two 
sample ambiguous verbs, "charge" and "pass". 
We hand coded them for semantic senses in each 
of the corpora we used as follows: 
Examples of 'charge' taken from BC. 
accuse: "His petition charged mental cruelty." 
attack: "When he charged Mickey was ready." 
money: "... 20 per cent ... was all he charged the 
traders." 
Examples of 'pass' taken from BC. 
movement: "Blue Throat's men spotted him ... as he 
passed." 
law" 'q'he President noted that Congress last year 
passed a law providing grants ..." 
transfer: "He asked, when she passed him a glass." 
test: "Those who T stayed had * to pass tests." 
We then asked two questions: 
1. Do different verb senses have different 
argument structure preferences? 
2. Do different corpora have different verb 
sense preferences, and therefore potentially 
different argument structure preferences? 
For both verbs examined (pass and charge) there 
was a significant effect of verb sense on argument 
structure probabilities (by X 2 p <.001 for 'charge' 
and p <.001 for 'pass'). The following chart 
shows a sample of this difference: 
that NP NPPP  passive 
Charge(accuse) 32 0 24 25 
Sample Frames and Senses from WSJ 
We then analyzed how often each sense was used 
in each of the corpora and found that there was 
again a significant difference (by X 2 p <.001 for 
'charge' ~ nd p <.001 for 'pass').

Senses of 'Pass' used in each corpus 
This analysis hows that it is possible for shifts in 
the relative frequency of each of a verbs senses to 
influence the observed subcat frequencies. 
We are currently extending our study to see if verb 
senses have constant subcategorization 
frequencies across corpora. This would be useful 
for word sense disambiguation and for parsing. 
If the verb sense is known, then a parser could use 
this information to help look for likely arguments. 
If the subcatagorization is known, then a 
disambiguator could use this information to find 
the sense of the verb. These could be used to 
bootstrap each other relying on the heuristic that 
only one sense is used within any discourse (Gale, 
Church, & Yarowsky 1992). 
6 Evaluation 
We had previously hoped to evaluate the accuracy 
of our treebank induduced subcategorization 
probabilities by comparing them with the 
COMLEX hand-coded probabilities (Macleod and 
1126 
Grishman 1994), but we used a different set of 
subcategorization frames than COMLEX. 
Instead, we hand checked a random sample of our 
data for errors. 
to find arguments that were located to the left of 
the verb. This is because arbitrary amounts of 
structure can intervene, expecially in the case of 
traces. 
The error rate in our data is between 3% and 7% 
for all verbs excluding 'say' type verbs such as 
'answer', 'ask', 'call', 'read', 'say', and 'write'. 
The error rate is given as a range due to the 
subjectivity of some types of errors. The errors 
can be divided into two classes; errors which are 
due to mis-parsed sentences in Treebank ~, and 
errors which are due to the inadequacy of our 
search strings in indentifying certain syntactic 
9atterns. 
Treebank-based rrors 
PP attachment 1% 
verb+particle vsverb+PP 2% 
NP/adverbial distinction 2% 
misc. miss-parsed sentences 1% 
Errors based on our search strinl~s 
missed traces and displaced arguments 1% 
"say" verbs missing quotes 6% 
Error rate by category 
In trying to estimate the maximum amount of 
error in our data, we found cases where it was 
possible to disagree with the parses/tags given in 
Treebank. Treebank examples given below 
include prepositional attachinent (1), the verb- 
particle/preposition distinction (2), and the 
NP/adverbial distinction (3). 
1. "Sam, I thought you \[knew \[everything\]~ 
\[about Tokyo\]pp\]" (BC) 
2. "...who has since moved \[on to other 
methods\]pp?" (BC) 
3. "Gross stopped \[bricfly\]Np?, then went on." 
(Be) 
Missed traces and displaced argument errors were 
a result of the difficulty in writing search strings 
1 All of our search patterns are based only on the 
information available in the Treebank 1coding system, 
since the Brown Corpus is only available in this 
scheme. The error rate for corpora available in 
Treebank 2 form would have been lower had we used 
all available information. 
Six percent of the data (overall) was improperly 
classified ue to the failure of our search patterns 
to identify all of the quote-type arguments which 
occur in 'say' type verbs. The identification of 
these elements is particularly problematic due to 
the asyntactic nature of these arguments, ranging 
from a sound (He said 'Argh!') to complex 
sentences. The presence or absense of quotation 
marks was not a completely reliable indicator of 
these arguments. This type of error affects only 
a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27% 
of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified, 
always by failing to find a quote-type argument of 
the verb. Using separate search strings for these 
verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these 
searches. 
Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular 
expressions that work on fiat tagged corpora 
instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us 
to gather information from larger corpora than 
have been done by the TreeBank project (see 
Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). 
7 Conclus ion 
We find that there are significant differences 
between the verb subcategorization frequencies 
generated through experimental methods and 
corpus methods, and between the frequencies found 
in different corpora. We have identified two 
distinct sources for these differences. Discourse 
influences are caused by the changes in the ways 
language is used in different discourse types and 
are to some extent predictable from the discourse 
type of the corpus in question. Semantic 
influences are based on the semantic ontext of the 
discourse. These differences may be predictable 
from the relative frequencies ofeach of the possible 
senses of the verbs in the corpus. An extensive 
analysis of the frame and sense frequencies of 
different verbs across different corpora is needed to 
verify this. This work is presently being carried 
out by us and others (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe 
1998). It is certain, however, that verb sense and 
1127 
discourse type play an important role in the 
frequencies observed in different experimental and 
corpus based sources of verb subcategorization 
frequencies
