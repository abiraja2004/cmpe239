Abstract
We present the annotation architecture of 
the National Corpus of Polish and discuss 
problems identified in the TEI stand-off 
annotation system,  which,  in  its  current 
version, is still very much unfinished and 
untested,  due  to  both  technical  reasons 
(lack  of  tools  implementing  the  TEI-
defined  XPointer  schemes)  and  certain 
problems concerning data representation. 
We  concentrate  on  two  features  that  a 
stand-off system should possess and that 
are conspicuously missing in the current 
TEI Guidelines.
1 Introduction
The present paper presents the National Corpus 
of  Polish  (NCP).1 The  project  is  a  joint 
undertaking  of  a  consortium  consisting  of 
institutions that created their own large corpora 
of Polish in the past (see (Przepi?rkowski et al, 
2008)  for  details);  these  corpora  formed  the 
initial data bank of the corpus. The intended size 
of the corpus is  one billion (109) tokens and as 
such, at the time of completion in 2010, the NCP 
is  going  to  be  one  of  the  largest  corpora 
available,  possibly  the  largest  corpus  featuring 
multiple levels of linguistic annotation of various 
kinds.  Currently,  a  hand-verified  one-million-
token subcorpus is being completed, and a basic, 
automatically created 430-million-token demo is 
available online at http://nkjp.pl/.
The project uses an extended morphosyntactic 
tagset with several years of practical use behind 
it  in  one  of  the  source  corpora  (cf. 
http://korpus.pl/)  and an open-source query en-
gine with a powerful, regex-based language and 
a graphical front-end.
Section  2  of  this  paper  talks  about  the 
encoding format adopted for the corpus, section 
1 The  Polish  name  of  the  corpus  is  Narodowy  Korpus 
J?zyka  Polskiego,  hence  the  abbreviation  NKJP,  used  in 
web addresses and namespace identifiers.
3 presents its general architecture, and section 4 
discusses  the  reasons  for,  and  our  implemen-
tation  of,  the  suggested  NCP  enhancements  to 
the TEI Guidelines.
2 The encoding format: stand-off TEI
The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI Consortium, 
2007) has been at the forefront of text annotation 
and resource interchange for many years. It has 
influenced corpus linguistic practices in at least 
three related ways. Firstly,  the formalism itself, 
in the mature  form,  has been used to  mark  up 
linguistic  corpora,  e.g.  the  British  National 
Corpus.  An  early  application  of  the  TEI,  the 
Corpus  Encoding  Standard  (CES;  see 
http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/), together with its 
XML  version,  XCES  (http://www.xces.org/), 
have served as de facto standards for corpus en-
coding  in  numerous  projects.  Finally,  the  ex-
perience gained in creating and using XCES (to-
gether with e.g. the feature-structure markup of 
the TEI) has served as a foundation for the Lin-
guistic  Annotation  Format  (LAF,  Ide  and  Ro-
mary, 2007), within ISO TC37 SC4.  LAF pro-
mises to provide a standard interchange format 
for  linguistic  resources  of  many  diverse  kinds 
and origins.
The relationship between the TEI (especially 
in its stand-off version) and the LAF is straight-
forward.  Both are implemented in XML, which 
makes transduction between a rigorous TEI for-
mat and the LAF ?dump? (pivot) format mostly a 
matter of fleshing out some data structures.
3 NCP ? general architecture 
Stand-off annotation is by now a well-grounded 
data representation technique,  pioneered by the 
CES and continuing to be the foundation of the 
LAF. In short, it assumes that the source text in 
the corpus, ideally kept in an unannotated form 
and in read-only files,  is the root of a possibly 
multi-file  system  of  data  descriptions  (each 
description focusing on a distinct aspect of the 
64
source data). The source text is typically accom-
panied by a level of primary segmentation, which 
may  be  the  lowest-level  XML  layer  of  anno-
tation.  The  other  files  form  a  possibly  multi-
leaved  and  multi-leveled  hierarchy  referencing 
either  the  level  of  primary  segmentation,  or 
higher  order  levels  of  description.  The  NCP 
follows these guidelines to the extent allowed by 
the TEI schema.
Each corpus text is kept in a separate directory 
together with the annotation files that reference it 
directly or indirectly, and with the header that is 
included  by  all  these  files.  Contents  of  an 
example directory are shown below.
(1) text.xml
header.xml
ann_morphosyntax.xml
ann_segmentation.xml
ann_structure.xml
All of these files contain TEI documents (or, in 
the case of header.xml, proper subsets thereof). 
They form a  hierarchy of  annotation levels,  as 
presented  in  Figure  1.  The  text.xml  file  is  the 
root,  referenced  by  the  layer  of  text  structure 
(providing  markup  from  the  paragraph  level 
upwards)  and  the  layer  of  segmentation.  The 
segmentation layer  is  further referenced by the 
layer of morphosyntactic information and word-
sense annotation. The morphosyntactic level, in 
turn,  is  the  basis  for  the  level  identifying  syn-
tactic  words,  which  constitutes  the  foundation 
upon  which  the  levels  identifying  syntactic 
chunks and named entities are built.
In  text.xml,  the  normalized  source  text  is 
divided in paragraph-sized chunks (enclosed in 
anonymous blocks, <ab>, to be further refined in 
the  text-structure  level  of  annotation).2 It  also 
2 Ideally,  as mentioned above,  the primary text should be 
stored without markup, and the segmentation layer should 
constitute the lowest-level XML document. This is exactly 
includes  two  headers:  the  main  corpus  header, 
which encodes information relevant to all  parts 
of  the  corpus,  and  the  local  header,  which 
records the information on the particular text and 
its annotations.
The segmentation file provides what the LAF 
calls the base segmentation level that is further 
used as the basis for other kinds of annotation. It 
is implemented as a TEI document with <seg> 
elements that contain XInclude instructions (see 
example (4) in the next section). As such, it may 
serve both as a separate annotation layer or as a 
merged  structure,  after  the  inclusion  directives 
are resolved. Crucially, in the latter case, which 
is  the  default  with  many parsers,  the  XPointer 
indexing information is lost. We shall come back 
to this issue in section 4.1.
The text-structure layer is defined similarly to 
the segmentation layer.  Other annotation layers 
replace the mechanism of XInclude with XLink, 
in the way advocated by the XCES.
The morphosyntactic layer of annotation con-
sists of a series of <seg> elements that contain 
TEI feature structures (i) providing basic infor-
mation on the segment,  (ii)  specifying the pos-
sible interpretations as identified by the morpho-
logical analyser, and (iii) pointing at the morpho-
what  the  LAF-encoded  American  National  Corpus  does, 
requiring dedicated tools for merging plain text corpus files 
with  the  segmentation  documents.  Unfortunately,  this  is 
where we reach the technological boundary of the XInclude 
system: it is unable to reference substrings in a plain text 
file,  due  to  a  weakly  motivated  ban  on  the  concurrent 
presence  of  @parse=?text?  attribute  and  the  @xpointer 
attribute.  We  therefore  enclose  the  source  text  in  ano-
nymous  blocks  (<ab>)  that  we  can  easily  address  with 
XPointers. An anonymous reviewer agrees that the lack of a 
single,  immutable  text  file  is  a  serious  weakness  of  this 
system and notes that being able to derive plain text from 
markup is no remedy. This may constitute either a case for 
XLink, or an argument for lifting the @parse/@pointer ban.

syntactic  description  selected  by  the  disambi-
guating agent.
The  higher-order  annotation  layers  also 
contain feature structures, which usually point at 
the  selected segments  of  annotation layers  that 
are one level  lower, and identify their  function 
within the given data structure.
4 Enhancements  to  the  TEI  stand-off 
recommendations
In this section, we first illustrate a case where the 
stand-off annotation system as advocated by the 
TEI  loses  information  on  the  boundedness  of 
segments,  and  then  move  on  to  illustrate  a 
different  issue  stemming  from  the  lack  of  a 
neutral bracket-like element in the TEI markup. 
4.1 Identification of bound segments
Segmentation  of  Polish  texts  is  not  a  trivial 
matter,  partially  because  of  the  person-number 
enclitics ? elements that can attach to almost any 
part  of  the  clause,  while  being  functionally 
related to  the  main  verb.  Segmenting them to-
gether  with  their  hosts,  apart  from  being  a 
methodologically  bad  move,  would  greatly  in-
crease the complexity of  the linguistic analysis 
built on top of such segmentations. The diamond 
in  (2)  below marks  alternative  positions  where 
the  2nd Person  Plural  clitic  (separated  by  a 
vertical  bar)  may  appear.  All  of  the  resulting 
sentences have the same interpretation.
(2) Czemu|?cie znowu? wczoraj? Piotra? gonili??
why|2pl again yesterday Piotr chased.prt
?Why did you chase Piotr yesterday again??
Yet  another  group  of  segmentation  problems 
concerns  compounds,  right-headed  (3a)  or  co-
ordinative (3b).
(3) a. ???to|czerwony materia?
yellow|red fabric
?yellowish red fabric?
b. ???to-czerwony materia?
?yellow and red fabric?
Inline markup of the above examples preserves 
information on which segment is bound (attached 
to  the  preceding  one)  or  free-standing.  This  is 
due  to  the  whitespace  intervening  between the 
<seg> elements in this kind of markup.
When,  however,  stand-off  markup  using  the 
XInclude  mechanism  is  applied  here,  com-
plications  arise.  The  segmental  level  of  anno-
tation with unresolved inclusions provides clear 
hints about the status of segments. This is due to 
XPointer  offsets,  as  can be seen  in  (4)  below, 
which is an example assuming that the adjective 
???to-czerwony is the first word in an <ab> ele-
ment bearing the @xml:id attribute set to ?t1?.3
(4)
<seg xml:id="segm_1.1-seg">
 <xi:include href="text.xml"
 xpointer="string-range(t1,0,5)"/></seg>
<seg xml:id="segm_1.2-seg">
 <xi:include href="text.xml"  
 xpointer="string-range(t1,5,1)"/></seg>
<seg xml:id="segm_1.3-seg">
 <xi:include href="text.xml" 
 xpointer="string-range(t1,6,8)"/></seg>
However, after inclusions are resolved, all of the 
offset  information  is  lost,  because  all  the 
@xpointer attributes (indeed, all the <xi:include> 
elements)  are  gone  and  all  that  remains  is  a 
sequence  of  <seg>  elements  such  as 
<seg>???to</seg><seg>-</seg><seg>cze
rwony</seg>.
While, in many cases, information on bound-
edness  could  be  recovered  from  the  morpho-
syntactic description of the given segment,  this 
does not resolve the issue because, firstly, a re-
course  to  morphosyntactic  annotation  layer  in 
order to recover information lost in the segmen-
tation layer is methodologically flawed (in some 
cases, it is perfectly imaginable that a text is only 
accompanied by the segmentation layer of anno-
tation and nothing else), and, secondly, morpho-
syntactic identity will not resolve all such cases. 
Consider the example of ???to-czerwony ?yellow 
and red?: the segment  czerwony here is bound, 
but  both  graphically  and  morphosyntactically 
identical  to  the  frequent  free-standing  segment 
czerwony ?red?.
In order to accommodate such cases, we have 
defined  an  additional  attribute  of  the  <seg> 
element,  @nkjp:nps,  where  ?nkjp:?  is  the  non-
TEI  namespace  prefix,  while  ?nps?  stands  for 
?no  preceding  space?  and  its  default  value  is 
?false?.  Naturally,  this  attribute  solves  issues 
specific to Polish and similar languages. It can be 
generalized  and  become  something  like 
@bound={?right?,  ?left?,  ?both?},  and  in  this 
shape, get incorporated into the TEI Guidelines. 
4.2 Structural  disjunction  between  alter-
native segmentations
One strategy to handle alternative segmentations, 
where the choice is between a single segment of 
3Note  that  here,  string-range()  is  an  XPointer  scheme 
defined by the TEI. It is not to be confused with the string-
range() function of the XPointer xpointer() scheme, defined 
by the W3C permanent working draft at http://www.w3.org/
TR/xptr-xpointer/.

the form <seg>New York</seg> and a sequence 
of two separate segments, <seg>New</seg> and 
<seg>York</seg>, is to perform radical segmen-
tation (always segment New and York separately) 
and provide an extra layer of alternative segmen-
tation that  may link the two parts  of  the name 
into  a  single  unit.  This  is  what  we  do  in  the 
creation  of  the  annotation  level  of  syntactic 
words that may, e.g., need to link the three seg-
ments of ???to-czerwony above into a single unit, 
because this is how they function in the syntactic 
representation.
In some cases, however, radical segmentation 
may create  false  or  misleading  representations, 
and  Polish  again  provides  numerous  relevant 
examples.  Sometimes  bound segments,  such as 
the person-number clitics illustrated in (2) above, 
are homophonous with parts of words.
(5) a. mia?|em vs. mia?em
had.prt|1sg fines.instr.sg
b. czy|m vs. czym
whether|1sg what.instr
c. gar|?cie vs. gar?cie
pot.acc|2pl fistful.nom.pl
One may attempt to defend radical segmentation 
for  case  (a)  on  the  not-so-innocent  assumption 
that segmenting tools might sometimes reach in-
side  morphological  complexes  and separate  af-
fixes  from stems,  rather  than clitics  from their 
hosts. However, examples (b) and (c) show that 
this is not a feasible approach here: the Instru-
mental  czym in (b) is monomorphemic, and the 
segmentation of  gar?cie ?fistfuls? into  gar- and 
-?cie is  likewise  false,  because  the  putative 
segment division would fall inside the root gar??.
Thus, radical segmentation is not an available 
strategy  in  the  case  at  hand.  What  we  need 
instead  is  a  way  to  express  the  disjunction 
between  a  sequence  such  as  <seg>mia?</seg> 
<seg>em</seg> (cf.  (5a)) on the one hand, and 
the  single  segment  <seg>mia?em</seg>  on  the 
other. It turns out that the TEI has no way of ex-
pressing this kind of relationship structurally.
The  TEI  Guidelines  offer  the  element 
<choice>, but it can only express disjunction bet-
ween  competing  segments,  and  never  between 
sequences thereof. The Guidelines also offer two 
non-structural methods of encoding disjunction. 
The first  uses the element  <join> (which is  an 
ID-based equivalent of a bracket ? it points to the 
segments that are to be virtually joined) and the 
element  <alt>  (which  points  at  encoding  alter-
natives).  The  other  utilizes  the  @exclude  at-
tribute, which, placed in one segment, points at 
elements that are to be ignored if the segment at 
hand  is  valid  (the  excluded  elements,  in  turn, 
point back at the excluding segment).
 Recall that the intended size of the corpus is 
one billion segments. Tools that process corpora 
of this size should not be forced to backtrack or 
look forward to see what forms a sequence and 
what the alternative to this sequence is. Instead, 
we  need  a  simple  structural  statement  of  dis-
junction between sequences.  The solution  used 
by  the  NCP  consists  in  (i)  adding  an  element 
meant to provide a semantically neutral bracket 
(<nkjp:paren>)  and  (ii)  including  <nkjp:paren> 
in the content model of <choice>. Note that this 
representation can be readily converted into the 
pivot format of the LAF:
(6)   <choice>
<seg>mia?em</seg>
<nkjp:paren>
<seg>mia?</seg>
<seg nkjp:nps=?true?>em</seg>
</nkjp:paren>
    </choice>
5 Conclusion
We have presented the TEI-P5-XML architecture 
of the National Corpus of Polish and identified 
some  weak  points  of  the  TEI-based  stand-off 
approach:  the  impossibility  of  keeping  the 
primary text unannotated in the XInclude system, 
the loss of information on segment-boundedness, 
and  the  absence  of  a  structural  statement  of 
disjunction between sequences of segments (this 
last  issue  is  also  due  to  the  lack,  among  the 
numerous detailed markup options provided by 
the  TEI,  of  a  semantically  neutral  bracket-like 
element  whose only role  would be to  embrace 
sequences of elements). 
We are grateful to the two anonymous LAW-
09 reviewers for their helpful comments.
