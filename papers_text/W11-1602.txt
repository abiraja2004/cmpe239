Abstract
In this work, we present a scenario where con-
textual targeted paraphrasing of sub-sentential
phrases is performed automatically to support
the task of text revision. Candidate para-
phrases are obtained from a preexisting reper-
toire and validated in the context of the orig-
inal sentence using information derived from
the Web. We report on experiments on French,
where the original sentences to be rewrit-
ten are taken from a rewriting memory au-
tomatically extracted from the edit history of
Wikipedia.
1 Introduction
There are many instances where it is reasonable to
expect machines to produce text automatically. Tra-
ditionally, this was tackled as a concept-to-text real-
ization problem. However, such needs apply some-
times to cases where a new text should be derived
from some existing texts, an instance of text-to-text
generation. The general idea is not anymore to pro-
duce a text from data, but to transform a text so as to
ensure that it has desirable properties appropriate for
some intended application (Zhao et al, 2009). For
example, one may want a text to be shorter (Cohn
and Lapata, 2008), tailored to some reader pro-
file (Zhu et al, 2010), compliant with some spe-
cific norms (Max, 2004), or more adapted for sub-
sequent machine processing tasks (Chandrasekar et
al., 1996). The generation process must produce
a text having a meaning which is compatible with
the definition of the task at hand (e.g. strict para-
phrasing for document normalization, relaxed para-
phrasing for text simplification), while ensuring that
it remains grammatically correct. Its complexity,
compared with concept-to-text generation, mostly
stems from the fact that the semantic relationship
between the original text and the new one is more
difficult to control, as the mapping from one text to
another is very dependent on the rewriting context.
The wide variety of techniques for acquiring phrasal
paraphrases, which can subsequently be used by text
paraphrasing techniques (Madnani and Dorr, 2010),
the inherent polysemy of such linguistic units and
the pragmatic constraints on their uses make it im-
possible to ensure that potential paraphrase pairs
will be substitutable in any context, an observation
which was already made at a lexical level (Zhao et
al., 2007). Hence, automatic contextual validation of
candidate rewritings is a fundamental issue for text
paraphrasing with phrasal units.
In this article, we tackle the problem of what we
call targeted paraphrasing, defined as the rewriting
of a subpart of a sentence, as in e.g. (Resnik et al,
2010) where it is applied to making parts of sen-
tences easier to translate automatically. While this
problem is simpler than full sentence rewriting, its
study is justified as it should be handled correctly
for the more complex task to be successful. More-
over, being simpler, it offers evaluation scenarios
which make the performance on the task easier to
assess. Our particular experiments here aim to as-
sist a Wikipedia contributor in revising a text to im-
prove its quality. For this, we use a collection of
phrases that have been rewritten in Wikipedia, and
test the substitutability of paraphrases coming from
a repertoire of sub-sentential paraphrases acquired
10
from different sources. We thus consider that preex-
isting repertoires of sub-sentential paraphrase pairs
are available, and that each potential candidate has to
be tested in the specific context of the desired rewrit-
ing. Due to the large variety of potential phrases
and their associated known paraphrases, we do not
rely on precomputed models of substitutability, but
rather build them on-the-fly using information de-
rived from web queries.1
This article is organized as follows. In section 2,
we first describe the task of text revision, where a
subpart of a sentence is rewritten, as an instance
of targeted paraphrasing. Section 3 presents previ-
ous works on the acquisition of sub-sentential para-
phrases and describes the knowledge sources that we
have used in this work. We then describe in section 4
how we estimate models of phrase substitution in
context by exploiting information coming from the
web. We present our experiments and their results in
section 5, and finally discuss our current results and
future work in section 6.
2 Targeted paraphrasing for text revision
One of the important processes of text revision is
the rewording of parts of sentences. Some reword-
ings are not intended to alter meaning significantly,
but rather to make text more coherent and easier to
comprehend. Those instances which express close
meanings are sub-sentential paraphrases: in their
simpler form, they can involve synonym substitu-
tion, but they can involve more complex deeper
lexical-syntactic transformations.
Such rephrasings are commonly found in record-
ings of text revisions, which now exist in large
quantities in the collaborative editing model of
Wikipedia. In fact, revision histories of the encyclo-
pedia contain a significant amount of sub-sentential
paraphrases, as shown by the study of (Dutrey et al,
2011). This study also reports that there is an impor-
tant variety of rephrasing phenomena, as illustrated
by the difficulty of reaching a good identification
coverage using a rule-based term variant identifica-
tion engine.
1Note that using the web may not always be appropriate, or
that at least it should be used in a different way than what we
propose in this article, in particular in cases where the desired
properties of the rewritten text are better described in controlled
corpora.
The use of automatic targeted paraphrasing as an
authoring aid has been illustrated by the work of
Max and Zock (2008), in which writers are pre-
sented with potential paraphrases of sub-sentential
fragments that they wish to reword. The automatic
paraphrasing technique used is a contextual vari-
ant of bilingual translation pivoting (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005). It has also been proposed
to externalize various text editing tasks, including
proofreading, by having crowdsourcing functions on
text directly from word processors (Bernstein et al,
2010).
Text improvements may also be more specifi-
cally targeted for automatic applications. In the
work by Resnik et al (2010), rephrasings for spe-
cific phrases are acquired through crowdsourcing.
Difficult-to-translate phrases in the source text are
first identified, and monolingual contributors are
asked to provide rephrasings in context. Collected
rephrasings can then be used as input for a Ma-
chine Translation system, which can positively ex-
ploit the increased variety in expression to pro-
duce more confident translations for better estimated
source units (Schroeder et al, 2009).2 For instance,
the phrase in bold in the sentence The number of
people known to have died has now reached 358
can be rewritten as 1) who died, 2) identified to
have died and 3) known to have passed away. All
such rephrasings are grammatically correct, the first
one being significantly shorter, and they all convey
a meaning which is reasonably close to the original
wording.
The task of rewriting complete sentences has also
been addressed in various works (e.g. (Barzilay and
Lee, 2003; Quirk et al, 2004; Zhao et al, 2010)). It
poses, however, numerous other challenges, in par-
ticular regarding how it could be correctly evalu-
ated. Human judgments of whole sentence trans-
formations are complex and intra- and inter-judge
coherence is difficult to attain with hypotheses of
comparable quality. Using sentential paraphrases
to support a given task (e.g. providing alternative
reference translations for optimizing Statistical Ma-
chine Translation systems (Madnani et al, 2008))
2It is to be noted that, in the scenario presented in (Resnik et
al., 2010), monolingual contributors cannot predict how useful
their rewritings will be to the underlying Machine Translation
engine used.
11
can be seen as a proxy for extrinsic evaluation of
the quality of paraphrases, but it is not clear from
published results that improvements on the task are
clearly correlated with the quality of the produced
paraphrases. Lastly, automatic metrics have been
proposed for evaluating the grammaticality of sen-
tences (e.g. (Mutton et al, 2007)). Automatic evalu-
ation of sentential paraphrases has not produced any
consensual results so far, as they do not integrate
task-specific considerations and can be strongly bi-
ased towards some paraphrasing techniques.
In this work, we tackle the comparatively more
modest task of sub-sentential paraphrasing applied
to text revision. In order to use an unbiased
task, we use a corpus of naturally-occurring rewrit-
ings from an authoring memory of Wikipedia ar-
ticles. We use the WICOPACO corpus (Max and
Wisniewski, 2010), a collection of local rephras-
ings from the edit history of Wikipedia which con-
tains instances of lexical, syntactical and semantic
rephrasings (Dutrey et al, 2011), the latter type be-
ing illustrated by the following example:
Ce vers de Nuit rhe?nane d?Apollinaire [qui para??t
presque sans structure rythmique? dont la ce?sure
est comme masque?e]. . . 3
The appropriateness of this corpus for our work
is twofold: first, the fact that it contains naturally-
occurring rewritings provides us with an interest-
ing source of text spans in context which have been
rewritten. Moreover, for those instances where the
meaning after rewriting was not significantly al-
tered, it provides us with at least one candidate
rewriting that should be considered as a correct para-
phrase, which can be useful for training validation
algorithms.
3 Automatic sub-sentential paraphrase
acquisition and generation
The acquisition of paraphrases, and in particular
of sub-sentential paraphrases and paraphrase pat-
terns, has attracted a lot of works with the advent of
data-intensive Natural Language Processing (Mad-
nani and Dorr, 2010). The techniques proposed have
a strong relationship to the type of text corpus used
3This verse from Apollinaire?s Nuit Rhe?nane [which seems
almost without rhythmic structure ? whose cesura is as if
hidden]. . .
for acquisition, mainly:
? pairs of sentential paraphrases (monolingual
parallel corpora) allow for a good precision
but evidently a low recall (e.g. (Barzilay and
McKeown, 2001; Pang et al, 2003; Cohn et
al., 2008; Bouamor et al, 2011))
? pairs of bilingual sentences (bilingual parallel
corpora) allow for a comparatively better re-
call (e.g. (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005;
Kok and Brockett, 2010))
? pairs of related sentences (monolingual com-
parable corpora) allow for even higher recall
but possibly lower precision (e.g. (Barzilay
and Lee, 2003; Li et al, 2005; Bhagat and
Ravichandran, 2008; Dele?ger and Zweigen-
baum, 2009)
Although the precision of such techniques can in
some cases be formulated with regards to a prede-
fined reference set (Cohn et al, 2008), it should
more generally be assessed in the specific context
of some use of the paraphrase pair. This refers to
the problem of substituability in context (e.g. (Con-
nor and Roth, 2007; Zhao et al, 2007)), which is a
well studied field at the lexical level and the object of
evaluation campains (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009).
Contextual phrase substitution poses the additional
challenge that phrases are rarer than words, so that
building contextual and grammatical models to en-
sure that the generated rephrasings are both seman-
tically compatible and grammatical is more compli-
cated (e.g. (Callison-Burch, 2008)).
The present work does not aim to present any
original technique for paraphrase acquisition, but
rather focusses on the task of sub-sentential para-
phrase validation in context. We thus resort to some
existing repertoire of phrasal paraphrase pairs. As
explained in section 2, we use the WICOPACO cor-
pus as a source of sub-sentential paraphrases: the
phrase after rewriting can thus be used as a potential
paraphrase in context.4 To obtain other candidates
of various quality, we used two knowledge sources.
The first uses automatic pivot translation (Bannard
and Callison-Burch, 2005), where a state-of-the-art
4Note, however, that in our experiments we will ask our hu-
man judges to assess anew its paraphrasing status in context.
12
general-purpose Statistical Machine Translation sys-
tem is used in a two-way translation. The second
uses manual acquisition of paraphrase candidates.
Web-based acquisition of this type of knowledge has
already been done before (Chklovski, 2005; Espan?a
Bonet et al, 2009), and could be done by crowd-
sourcing, a technique growing in popularity in recent
years. We have instead formulated manual acquisi-
tion as a web-based game. Players can take parts in
two parts of the game, illustrated on Figure 3.
First, players propose sub-sentential paraphrases
in context for selected text spans in web documents
(top of Figure 3), and then raters can take part in as-
sessing paraphrases proposed by other players (bot-
tom of Figure 3). In order to avoid any bias, players
cannot evaluate games in which they played. Eval-
uation is sped up by using a compact word lattice
view for eliciting human judgments, built using the
syntactic fusion algorithm of (Pang et al, 2003).
Data acquisition was done in French to remain co-
herent with our experiments on the French corpus
of WICOPACO, and both players and raters were
native speakers. An important point is that in our
experiments the context of acquisition and of evalu-
ation were different: players were asked to generate
paraphrases in contexts that are different from those
of the WICOPACO corpus used for evaluation. To
this end, web snippets were automatically retrieved
for the various phrases of our dataset without con-
texts, so that sentences from the Web (but not from
Wikipedia) were used for manual paraphrase acqui-
sition. This allows us to simulate the availability of a
preexisting repertoire of (contextless) sub-sentential
paraphrases, and to assess the performance of our
contextual validation techniques on a possibly in-
compatible context.
4 Web-based contextual validation
Given a repertoire of potential phrasal paraphrases
and a context for a naturally-occurring rewriting, our
task consists in deciding automatically which poten-
tial paraphrases can be substituted with good confi-
dence for the original phrase. A concrete instantia-
tion of it could correspond to the proposal of Max
and Zock (2008), where such candidate rephrasings
could be presented in order of decreasing suitability
to a word processor user, possibly during the revi-
sion of a Wikipedia article.
The specific nature of the text units that we are
dealing with calls for a careful treatment: in the
general scenario, it is unlikely that any supervised
corpus would contain enough information for ap-
propriate modeling of the substituability in context
decision. It is therefore tempting to consider using
the Web as the largest available information source,
in spite of several of its known limitations, includ-
ing that data can be of varying quality. It has how-
ever been shown that a large range of NLP applica-
tions can be improved by exploiting n-gram counts
from the Web (using Web document counts as a
proxy) (Lapata and Keller, 2005).
Paraphrase identification has been addressed pre-
viously, both using features computed from an of-
fline corpus (Brockett and Dolan, 2005) and fea-
tures computed from Web queries (Zhao et al,
2007). However, to our knowledge previous work
exploiting information from the Web was limited to
the identification of lexical paraphrases. Although
the probability of finding phrase occurrences sig-
nificantly increases by considering the Web, some
phrases are still very rare or not present in search
engine indexes.
As in (Brockett and Dolan, 2005), we tackle our
paraphrase identification task as one of monolingual
classification. More precisely, considering an orig-
inal phrase p within the context of sentence s, we
seek to determine whether a candidate paraphrase p?
would be a grammatical paraphrase of p within the
context of s. We make use of a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) classifier which exploits the features
described in the remainder of this section.
Edit distance model score Surface similarity on
phrase pairs can be a good indicator that they share
semantic content. In order to account for the cost
of transforming one string into the other, rather
than simply counting common words, we use the
score produced by the Translation Edit Rate met-
ric (Snover et al, 2010). Furthermore, we perform
this computation on strings of lemmas rather than
surface forms:5
5Note that because we computed the TER metric on French
strings, stemming and semantic matching through WordNet
were not activated.

all text spans highlighted by the game creator on any webpage (a Wikipedia article on the example). On the bottom,
raters evaluate paraphrases proposed by sets of players using a compact word-lattice view. Note that in its standard
definition, the game attributes higher scores to paraphrase candidates that are highly rated and rarer.
hedit = TER(Lemorig, Lempara) (1)
Note that this model is not derived from informa-
tion from the Web, in contrast to all the models de-
scribed next.
Language model score The likelihood of a sen-
tence can be a good indicator of its grammatical-
ity (Mutton, 2006). Language model probabilities
can now be obtained from Web counts. In our ex-
periments, we used the Microsoft Web N-gram Ser-
vice6 for research (Wang et al, 2010) to obtain log
likelihood scores for text units.7 However, this score
is certainly not sufficient as it does not take the orig-
inal wording into account. We therefore used a ratio
of the language model score of the paraphrased sen-
tence with the language model score of the original

dently of encodings: careful examination of ranked hypotheses

(2)
Contextless thematic model scores Cooccurring
words are used in distributional semantics to account
for common meanings of words. We build vector
representations of cooccurrences for both the origi-
nal phrase p and its paraphrase p?. Our contextless
thematic model is built in the following fashion: we
query a search engine to retrieve the top N docu-
ment snippets for phrase p. We then count frequen-
cies for all content words in these snippets, and keep
the set W of words appearing more than a fraction
of N . We then build a vector T (thematic profile)
of dimension |W | where values are computed by the
following formula:
Tnocontorig [w] =
count(p, w)
count(p)
(3)
14
where count(x) correspond to the number of docu-
ments containing a given exact phrase or word ac-
cording to the search engine used and count(x, y)
correspond to the number of documents containing
simultaneously both. We then compute the same
thematic profile for the paraphrase p?, using only the
subset of words W :
Tnocontpara [w] =
count(p?, w)
count(p)
(4)
Finally, we compute a similarity between the two
profiles by taking the cosinus between their two vec-
tors:
hnocontthem =
Tnocontorig ? T
nocont
para
||Tnocontorig || ? ||T
nocont
para ||
(5)
In all our experiments, we used the Yahoo! Search
BOSS8 Web service for obtaining Web counts and
retrieving snippets. Assuming that the distribution
of words in W is not biased by the result ordering
of the search engine, our model measures some sim-
ilarity between the most cooccurring content words
with p and the same words with p?.
Context-aware thematic model scores Our
context-aware thematic model takes into account
the words of sentence s in which the substitution
of p with p? is attempted. We now consider the set
of content words from s (s being the part of the
sentence without phrase p) in lieu of the previous
set of cooccurring words W , and compute the
same profile vectors and similarity between that of
the original sentence and that of the paraphrased
sentence:
hcontthem =
T contorig ? T
cont
para
||T contorig || ? ||T
cont
para||
(6)
However, words from s might not be strongly
cooccurring with p. In order to increase the likeli-
hood of finding thematically related words, we also
build an extended context model, hextcontthem where
content words from s are supplemented with their
most cooccurring words. This is done using the
same procedure as that previously used for finding
content words cooccurring with p.

5 Experiments
In this section we report on experiments conducted
to assess the performance of our proposed approach
for validating candidate sub-sentential paraphrases
using information from the Web.
5.1 Data used
We randomly extracted 150 original sentences in
French and their rewritings from the WICOPACO
corpus which were marked as paraphrases. Of those,
we kept 100 for our training corpus and the remain-
ing 50 for testing. The number of original phrases of
each length is reported on Figure 2.
phrase length 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
original phrases 0 3 29 8 6 2 2 0
paraphrases 39 64 74 36 21 10 5 1
Figure 2: Distribution of number of phrases per phrase
length in tokens for the test corpus
For each original sentence, we collected 5 candi-
date paraphrases to simulate the fact that we had a
repertoire of paraphrases with the required entries:9
? WICOPACO: the original paraphrase from the
WICOPACO corpus;
? GAME: two candidate paraphrases from users
of our Web-based game;
? PIVOTES and PIVOTZH: two candidate para-
phrases obtained by translation by pivot, using
the Google Translate10 online SMT system and
one language close to French as pivot (Span-
ish), and another one more distant (Chinese).
We then presented the original sentence and its 5
paraphrases (in random order) to two judges. Four
native speakers took part in our experiments: they
all took part in the data collection for one half of
the sentences of the training and test corpora and to
the evaluation of paraphrases for the other half. For
the annotation with two classes (paraphrase vs. not
paraphrase), we obtain as inter-judge agreement11 a

ment related to the recall of any technique here.

pute this Cohen?s ? value.

original sentence (The brand is at the origin of many concepts that have revolutionized computing.) is paraphrased

l?origine (the origin).
value of ? = 0.65, corresponding to a substantial
agreement according to the literature. An example
of the interface used is provided in Figure 3.
We considered that our technique could not pro-
pose reliable results when web phrase counts were
too low. From the distribution of counts of phrases
and paraphrases from our training set (see Figure 4),
we empirically chose a threshold of 10 for the min-
imum count of any phrase. Our corpus was conse-
quently reduced from 750=150*5 to 434 examples
for the training corpus, and from 250=50*5 to 215
for the test corpus.

Results will be reported for three conditions:
? Possible: the gold standard for instances where
at least one of the judges indicated ?para-
phrases? records the pair as a paraphrase. In
this condition, the test set has 116 instances that
are paraphrases and 99 that are not.
? Sure: the gold standard for instances where not
all judges indicated ?paraphrases? records the
pair as not paraphrase. In this condition, the
test set has 76 instances that are paraphrases
and 139 that are not.
? Surer: only those instances where both judges
agree are recorded. This reduces our training
and test set to respectively 287 and 175 exam-
ples. Thus, results on this subcorpora will not
be directly comparable with the other results.
In this condition, the test set has 76 instances
that are paraphrases and 99 that are not.
5.2 Baseline techniques
Web-count based baselines We used two base-
lines based on simple Web counts. The first one,
WEBLM, considers a candidate sentence a para-
phrase of the original sentence whenever its Web
language model score is higher than that of the orig-
inal phrase. The second one, BOUNDLM, considers
a sentence as a paraphrase whenever the counts for
the bigrams crossing the left and right boundary of
the sub-sentential paraphrase is higher than 10.
Syntactic dependency baseline When rewriting a
subpart of a sentence, the fact that syntactic depen-
dencies between the rewritten phrase and its con-
text are the same than those of the original phrase
and the same context can provide some information
16
about the grammatical and semantic substituability
of the two phrases (Zhao et al, 2007; Max and Zock,
2008). We thus build syntactic dependencies for
both the original and rewritten sentence, using the
French version (Candito et al, 2010) of the Berkeley
probabilistic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), and
consider the subset of dependencies for the two sen-
tences that exist between a word inside the phrase
under focus and a word outside it (Deporig and
Deppara). Our CONTDEP baseline considers a sen-
tence as a paraphrase iff Deppara = Deporig.
5.3 Evaluation results
We used the models described in Section 4 to build
a SVM classifier using the LIBSVM package (Chang
and Lin, 2001). Accuracy results are reported on
Figure 5.
WEBLM BOUNDLM CONTDEP CLASSIFIER
POSSIBLE 62.79 54.88 48.53 57.67
SURE 68.37 36.27 51.90 70.69
SURER 56.79 51.41 42.69 62.85
Figure 5: Accuracy results for the three baselines and our
classifier on the test set for the three conditions. Note that
the SURER condition cannot be directly compared with
the other two as the number of training and test examples
are not the same.
The first notable observation is that our task is not
surprisingly a difficult one. The best performance
achieved is an accuracy of 70.69 with our system in
the SURE condition. There are, however, some im-
portant variations across conditions, with a result as
low as 57.67 for our system in the POSSIBLE condi-
tion (recall that in this condition candidates are con-
sidered paraphrases when only one of the two judges
considered it a paraphrase, i.e. when the two judges
disagreed).
Overall, the WEBLM baseline and our system ap-
pear as stronger than the two other baselines. The
two lower baselines, BOUNDLM and CONTDEP, at-
tempt to model local grammatical constraints, which
are not surprisingly not sufficient for paraphrase
identification. WEBLM is comparatively a much
more competitive baseline, but its accuracy in the
SURER condition is not very strong. As this latter
condition considers only consensual judgements for
the two judges, we can hypothesize that the interpre-
tation of its results is more reliable. In this condi-

acquisition methods for the three conditions.
tion, our system obtains the best performance, with
a +6.06 advantage over WEBLM. As found in other
works (e.g. (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005)),
using language models for paraphrase validation is
not sufficient as it cannot model meaning preserva-
tion, and our results show that this is also true even
when counts are estimated from the Web. Using a
ratio of normalized LM scores may have improved
the situation a bit.12
Lastly, we report in Figure 6 the paraphrase
accuracy of each individual acquisition technique
(i.e. source of paraphrases from the preexisting
repertoire). The original rewritting from WICO-
PACO obtains not surprisingly a very high para-
phrase accuracy, in particular in the POSSIBLE and
SURER conditions. Paraphrases obtained through
our Web-based game have an acceptable accuracy:
the numbers confirm that paraphrase pairs are highly
context-dependent, because the pairs which were
likely to be paraphrases in the context of the game
are not necessarily so in a different context. This,
of course, may be due to a number of reasons that
we will have to investigate. Lastly, there is a signif-
icant drop in accuracy for the automatic pivot para-
phrasers, but pivoting through Spanish obtained, not
suprisingly again, a much better performance than
pivoting through Chinese.
6 Discussion and future work
We have presented an approach to the task of
targeted paraphrasing in the context of text revi-
sion, a scenario which was supported by naturally-
occurring data from the rephrasing memory of
Wikipedia. Our framework takes a repertoire of ex-
isting sub-sentential paraphrases, coming from pos-
12A possible explanation for the relative good performance of
WEBLM may lie in the fact that our two automatic paraphrasers
using Google Translate as a pivot translation engine tend to pro-
duce strings that are very likely according to the language mod-
els used by the translation system, which we assume to be very
comparable to those that were used in our experiments.

sibly any source including manual acquisition, and
validates all candidate paraphrases using informa-
tion from the Web. Our experiments have shown
that the current version of our classifier outperforms
several baselines when considering paraphrases with
consensual judgements in the gold standard refer-
ence.
Although our initial experiments are positive, we
believe that they can be improved in a number of
ways. We intend to broaden our exploration of the
various characteristics at play. We will try more fea-
tures, including e.g. a model of syntactic depen-
dencies derived from the Web, and extend our work
to new languages. We will also attempt to analyze
more precisely our results to identify problematic
cases, some of which could turn to be almost im-
possible to model without resorting to world knowl-
edge, which was beyond our attempted modeling.
Finally, we will also be interested in considering the
applicability of this approach as a framework for the
evaluation of paraphrase acquisition techniques.
