Abstract
We further work on detecting errors in post-
positional particle usage by learners of Korean
by improving the training data and develop-
ing a complete pipeline of particle selection.
We improve the data by filtering non-Korean
data and sampling instances to better match
the particle distribution. Our evaluation shows
that, while the data selection is effective, there
is much work to be done with preprocessing
and system optimization.
1 Introduction
A growing area of research in analyzing learner lan-
guage is to detect errors in function words, namely
categories such as prepositions and articles (see Lea-
cock et al, 2010, and references therein). This work
has mostly been for English, and there are issues,
such as greater morphological complexity, in mov-
ing to other languages (see, e.g., de Ilarraza et al,
2008; Dickinson et al, 2010). Our goal is to build a
machine learning system for detecting errors in post-
positional particles in Korean, a significant source of
learner errors (Ko et al, 2004; Lee et al, 2009b).
Korean postpositional particles are morphemes
that attach to a preceding nominal to indicate a range
of linguistic functions, including grammatical func-
tions, e.g., subject and object; semantic roles; and
discourse functions. In (1), for instance, ka marks
the subject (function) and agent (semantic role).1
Similar to English prepositions, particles can also
have modifier functions, adding meanings of time,
location, instrument, possession, and so forth.

We treat the task of particle error detection as
one of particle selection, and we use machine learn-
ing because it has proven effective in similar tasks
for other languages (e.g., Chodorow et al, 2007;
Oyama, 2010). Training on a corpus of well-formed
Korean, we predict which particle should appear af-
ter a given nominal; if this is different from the
learner?s, we have detected an error. Using a ma-
chine learner has the advantage of being able to per-
form well without a researcher having to specify
rules, especially with the complex set of linguistic
relationships motivating particle selection.2
We build from Dickinson et al (2010) in two
main ways: first, we implement a presence-selection
pipeline that has proven effective for English prepo-
sition error detection (cf. Gamon et al, 2008). As
the task is understudied, the work is preliminary, but
it nonetheless is able to highlight the primary ar-
eas of focus for future work. Secondly, we improve
upon the training data, in particular doing a better
job of selecting relevant instances for the machine
learner. Obtaining better-quality training data is a
major issue for machine learning applied to learner
language, as the domain of writing is different from
news-heavy training domains (Gamon, 2010).

2 Particle error detection
2.1 Pre-processing
Korean is an agglutinative language: Korean words
(referred to as ecels) are usually composed of a
root with a number of functional affixes. We thus
first segment and POS tag the text, for both train-
ing and testing, using a hybrid (trigram + rule-
based) morphological tagger for Korean (Han and
Palmer, 2004). The tagger is designed for native
language and is not optimized to make guesses for
ill-formed input. While the POS tags assigned to the
learner corpus are thus often incorrect (see Lee et al,
2009a), there is the more primary problem of seg-
mentation, as discussed in more detail in section 4.
2.2 Machine learning
We use the Maximum Entropy Toolkit (Le, 2004)
for machine learning. Training on a corpus of well-
formed Korean, we predict which particle should ap-
pear after a given nominal; if this is different from
what the learner used, we have detected an error. It
is important that the data represent the relationships
between specific lexical items: in the comparable
English case, for example, interest is usually found
with in: interest in/*with learning.
Treating the ends of nominal elements as possible
particle slots, we break classification into two steps:
1) Is there a particle? (Yes/No); and 2) What is the
exact particle? Using two steps eases the task of ac-
tual particle prediction: with a successful classifica-
tion of negative and positive instances, there is no
need to handle nominals that have no particle in step
2. To evaluate our parameters for obtaining the most
relevant instances, we keep the task simple and per-
form only step 1, as this step provides information
about the usability of the training data. For actual
system performance, we evaluate both steps.
In selecting features for Korean, we have to ac-
count for relatively free word order (Chung et al,
2010). We follow our previous work (Dickinson
et al, 2010) in our feature choices, using a five-
word window that includes the target stem and two
words on either side for context (see also Tetreault
and Chodorow, 2008). Each word is broken down
into: stem, affixes, stem POS, and affixes POS. We
also have features for the preceding and following
noun and verb, thereby approximating relevant se-
lectional properties. Although these are relatively
shallow features, they provide enough lexical and
grammatical context to help select better or worse
training data (section 3) and to provide a basis for a
preliminary system (section 4).
3 Obtaining the most relevant instances
We need well-formed Korean data in order to train
a machine learner. To acquire this, we use web-
based corpora, as this allows us to find data similar
to learner language, and using web as corpus (WaC)
tools allows us to adjust parameters for new data
(Dickinson et al, 2010). However, the methodology
outlined in Dickinson et al (2010) can be improved
in at least three ways, outlined next.
3.1 Using sub-corpora
Web corpora can be built by searching for a set of
seed terms, extracting documents with those terms
(Baroni and Bernardini, 2004). One way to improve
such corpora is to use better seeds, namely, those
which are: 1) domain-appropriate (e.g., about trav-
eling), and 2) of an appropriate level. In Dickinson
et al (2010), we show that basic terms result in poor
quality Korean, but slightly more advanced terms on
the same topics result in better-formed data.
Rather than use all of the seed terms to create a
single corpus, we divide the seed terms into 13 sep-
arate sets, based on the individual topics from our
learner corpus. The sub-corpora are then combined
to create a cohesive corpus covering all the topics.
For example, we use 10 Travel words to build a
subcorpus, 10 Learning Korean words for a differ-
ent subcorpus, and so forth. This means that terms
appropriate for one topic are not mixed with terms
for a different topic, ensuring more coherent web
documents. Otherwise, we might obtain a Health
Management word, such as pyengwen (?hospital?),
mixed with a Generation Gap word, such as kaltung
(?conflict?)?in this case, leading to webpages on
war, a topic not represented in our learner corpus.
3.2 Filtering
One difficulty with our web corpora is that some of
them have large amounts of other languages along
with Korean. The keywords are in the corpora, but
there is additional text, often in Chinese, English, or
Japanese. These types of pages are unreliable for
82
our purposes, as they may not exhibit natural Ko-
rean. By using a simple filter, we check whether a
majority of the characters in a webpage are indeed
from the Korean writing system, and remove pages
beneath a certain threshold.
3.3 Instance sampling
Particles are often dropped in colloquial and even
written Korean, whereas learners are more often
required to use them. It is not always the case
that the web pages contain the same ratio of par-
ticles as learners are expected to use. To alleviate
this over-weighting of having no particle attached
to a noun, we propose to downsample our corpora
for the machine learning experiments, by remov-
ing a randomly-selected proportion of (negative) in-
stances. Instance sampling has been effective for
other NLP tasks, e.g., anaphora resolution (Wunsch
et al, 2009), when the number of negative instances
is much greater than the positive ones. In our web
corpora, nouns have a greater than 50% chance of
having no particle; in section 3.4, we thus downsam-
ple to varying amounts of negative instances from
about 45% to as little as 10% of the total corpus.
3.4 Training data selection
In Dickinson et al (2010), we used a Korean learner
data set from Lee et al (2009b) for development. It
contains 3198 ecels, 1842 of which are nominals,
and 1271 (?70%) of those have particles. We use
this same corpus for development, to evaluate filter-
ing and down-sampling. Evaluating on (yes/no) par-
ticle presence, in tables 1 and 2, recall is the percent-
age of positive instances we correctly find and pre-
cision is the percentage of instances that we classify
as positive that actually are. A baseline of always
guessing a particle gives 100% recall, 69% preci-
sion, and 81.7% F-score.
Table 1 shows the results of the MaxEnt system
for step 1, using training data built for the topics in
the data with filter thresholds of 50%, 70%, 90%,
and 100%?i.e., requiring that percentage of Korean
characters?as well as the unfiltered corpus. The
best F-score is with the filter set at 90%, despite the
size of the filtered corpus being smaller than the full
corpus. Accordingly, we use the 90% filter on our
training corpus for the experiments described below.

pling ratios of 1.3/1 (?43% negative instances), 2/1
(?33%), 4/1 (?20%), and 10/1 (?10%). We select
the 90% filter, 1.3/1 downsampling settings and ap-
ply them to the training corpus (section 3.1) for all
experiments below.

Table 2: Step 1 (presence) results with instance sampling
One goal has been to improve the web as corpus
corpus methodology for training a machine learning
system. The results in tables 1 and 2 reinforce our
earlier finding that size is not necessarily the most
important variable in determining the usefulness or
overall quality of data collected from the web for
NLP tasks (Dickinson et al, 2010). Indeed, the cor-
pus producing best results (90% filter, 1.3:1 down-
sampling) is more than 3 million instances smaller
than the unfiltered, unsampled corpus.
4 Initial system evaluation
We have obtained an annotated corpus of 25 essays
from heritage intermediate learners,3 with 299 sen-
tences and 2515 ecels (2676 ecels after correcting
spacing errors). There are 1138 nominals, with 93
particle errors (5 added particles, 35 omissions, 53
substitutions)?in other words, less than 10% of par-
ticles are errors. There are 979 particles after cor-
rection. We focus on 38 particles that intermediate

age, such as growing up with Korean spoken at home.

students can be reasonably expected to use. A parti-
cle is one of three types (cf. Nam and Ko, 2005): 1)
case markers, 2) adverbials (cf. prepositions), and
3) auxiliary particles.4
Table 3 gives the results for the entire system on
the test corpus, with separate results for each cat-
egory of particle, (Case, Adv., and Aux.) as well
as the concatenation of the three (All). The ac-
curacy presented here is in terms of only the par-
ticle in question, as opposed to the full form of
root+particle(s). Step 2 is presented in 2 ways: Clas-
sified, meaning that all of the instances classified as
needing a particle by step 1 are processed, or Gold,
in which we rely on the annotation to determine par-
ticle presence. It is not surprising, then, that Gold
experiments are more accurate than Classified ex-
periments, due to step 1 errors and also preprocess-
ing issues, discussed next.

Preprocessing For the particles we examine, there
are 135 mis-segmented nominals. The problem is
more conspicuous if we look at the entire corpus:
the tagger identifies 1547 nominal roots, but there
are only 1138. Some are errors in segmentation, i.e.,
mis-identifying the proper root of the ecel, and some
are problems with tagging the root, e.g., a nominal
mistagged as a verb. Table 4 provides results divided
by cases with only correctly pre-processed ecels and
where the target ecel has been mis-handled by the
tagger. This checks whether the system particle is
correct, ignoring whether the whole form is correct;
if full-form accuracy is considered, we have no way
to get the 135 inaccurate cases correct.

lish a starting point, the ultimate, on-going goal of

this work is to develop a robust system for automati-
cally detecting errors in learner data. Thus, it is nec-
essary to measure our performance at actually find-
ing the erroneous instances extracted from our test
corpus. Table 5 provides results for step 2 in terms
of our ability to detect erroneous instances. We re-
port precision and recall, calculated as in figure 1.

4.1 Discussion and Outlook
One striking aspect about the results in table 3 is the
gap in accuracy between case particles and the other
two categories, particularly in step 2. This points at
a need to develop independent systems for each type
of particle, each relying on different types of linguis-
tic information. Auxiliary particles, for example, in-
clude topic particles which?similar to English arti-
cles (Han et al, 2006)?require discourse informa-
tion to get correct. Still, as case particles comprise
more than half of all particles in our corpus, the sys-
tem is already potentially useful to learners.
Comparing the rows in table 4, the dramatic drop
in accuracy when moving to inaccurately-processed
84
cases shows a clear need for preprocessing adapted
to learner data. While it is disconcerting that nearly
15% (135/916) of the cases have no chance of re-
sulting in a correct full form, the results indicate that
we can obtain reliable accuracy (cf. 94.24%) for pre-
dicting particle presence across all types of particles,
assuming good morphological tagging.
From table 5, it is apparent that we are overguess-
ing errors; recall that only 10% of particles are er-
roneous, whereas we more often guess a different
particle. While this tendency results in high recall,
a tool for learners should have higher precision, so
that correct usage is not flagged. However, this is
a first attempt at error detection, and simply know-
ing that precision is low means we can take steps
to solve this deficiency. Our training data may have
too many possible classes in it, and we have not yet
accounted for phonological alternations; e.g. if the
system guesses ul when lul is correct, we count a
miss, even though they are different realizations of
the same morpheme.
To try and alleviate the over-prediction of errors,
we have begun to explore implementing a confi-
dence filter. As a first pass, we use a simple fil-
ter that compares the probability of the best parti-
cle to the probability of the particle the learner pro-
vided; the absolute difference in probabilities must
be above a certain threshold. Table 6 provides the er-
ror detection results for each type of particle, incor-
porating confidence filters of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
50%, and 60%. The results show that increasing the
threshold at which we accept the classifier?s answer
can significantly increase precision, at the cost of re-
call. As noted above, higher precision is desirable,
so we plan on further developing this confidence fil-
ter. We may also include heuristic-based filters, such
as the ones implemented in Criterion (see Leacock
et al, 2010), as well as a language model approach
(Gamon et al, 2008).
Finally, we are currently working on improving
the POS tagger, testing other taggers in the pro-
cess, and developing optimal feature sets for differ-
ent kinds of particles.
