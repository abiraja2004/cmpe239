Abst ract  
Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is an 
attractive formalism for linguistic description mainly 
because cff its extended omain of locality and its 
factoring recursion out from the domain of local 
dependencies (Joshi, 1985, Kroch and Joshi, 1985, 
Abeilld, 1988). LTAG's extended omain of locality 
enables one to localize syntactic dependencies ( uch 
as filler-gap), as well as semantic dependencies ( uch 
as predicate-arguments). The aim of this paper is to 
show that these properties combined with the lex- 
icalized property of LTAG are especially attractive 
for machine translation. 
The transfer between two languages, such as 
French and English, can be done by putting di- 
rectly into correspondence large elementary units 
without going through some interlingual representa- 
tion and without major changes to the source and 
target grammars. The underlying formalism for the 
transfer is "synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars" 
(Shieber and Schabes \[1990\]) 1. Transfer rules are 
stated as correspondences between odes of trees of 
large domain of locality which are associated with 
words. We can thus define lexical transfer ules that 
avoid the defects of a mere word-to-word approach 
but still benefit from the simplicity and elegance of 
a lexical approach. 
We rely on the French and English LTAG gram- 
mars (Abeille \[1988\], Abeille \[1.990 (b)\], Abeilld et 
al. \[1990\], Abeill6 and Schabes \[1989, 1990\]) that 
have been designed over the past two years jointly at 
University of Pennsylvania nd University of Paris 
7-Jussieu.

and has been exemplified by Kaplan, et al, (1989) 
for LFG, Beaven etal. for UCG (1988), Dorr for GB 
(1989) and Arnold et al for Eurotra (1986). tIow- 
ever, our approach is more radical in the sense that 
we associate with the lexical items structures that lo- 
calize syntactic and semantic dependencies. This al- 
lows for the possibility that an explicit semantic rep- 
resentation level can be avoided. 2 The claims about 
the advantages ofan explicit semantic representation 
level need to be investigated again in the context of 
the approach proposed here. For examples, many 
traditionally difficult problems for machine transla- 
tion due to different divergence types (Dorr 1989) 
such as categorial, thematic, conflational, structural 
and lexical are not problems in the approach we sug- 
gest, Also contrary to UCG, but like LFG, we use 
grammars that have not been designed for the pur- 
pose of translation. 
The underlying formalism achieving the transfer 
of derivations i "Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Gram- 
mars" (as described in a companion paper by Shieber 
and Schabes \[1990\]). ~ The strategy adopted for 
machine translation consists of matching the source 
LTAG derivation of the source sentence to a target 
LTAG derivation by looking at a transfer lexicon. 
The transfer lexicon puts into correspondence a tree 
from the source grammar instantiated by lexical in- 
sertion (all its nodes and their attributes) with a tree 
from the target grammar. Although the approach is 
not inherently directional, for convenience we will 
call the English and French grammars, the source 
and target grammars. 
The translation proces.s consists of three steps in 
which the generation step is reduced to a trivial 
step. First the source sentence is parsed accord- 
ingly to the source grammar. Each elementary tree 
in the derivation is now considered with the features 
given from the derivation through unification. Sec- 
ond, the source derivation tree is transferred to a 
2The formalism of Synchronous Tree-Adjolning Grammar 
does not prevent constructing an explicit semantic represen- 
tation. In fact, in Shieber and Schabes (1990) it is shown how 
to construct a semantic representation, which itself is a TAG. 
3We assume that the reader is familiar with Tree Adjoining 
Grammars. We refer the reader to Joshi (1987) for an intro- 
duction to TAGs. We also refer the reader to the companion 
paper for more details on synchronous TAGs.

target derivation. This step maps each elementary 
tree in the source derivation tree to a tree in the tar- 
get derivation tree by looking in the transfer lexicon. 
And finally, the target sentence isgenerated from the 
target derivation tree obtained in the previous tep. 
As an example, consider the fragment of the trans- 
fer lexicon given in Figure 1.

Fragment of the English-French transfer 
The transfer lexicon consists of pairs of trees one 
from the source language and one from the target 
language. Within the pair of trees, nodes may be 
linked (thick lines). Whenever in a source tree, say 
Got, roe, adjunction or substitution is performed on a 
linked node (say nso~ is linked to n,~, t ) ,  the cor- 
responding tree paired with tsouree, ttaraet, operates 
on the linked node ntaraet. For example, suppose we 
start with the pair 7 and we operate the pair a on 
the link from the English node NPo to the French 
node NPI. This operation yields the derived pair 
o~1.

Then, if the pair/3 operates on the NP1-NPo in

in a~, the pair a3 is generated.

The source sentence is parsed accordingly to the 
source grammar, then the target derivation is gener- 
ated by tracing the pairs stated in the transfer lex- 
icon. The fragment of the transfer lexicon given in 
Figure 1 therefore nables us to translate: 
Apparently, John misses Mary 
Apparemment, Mary manque ~ John 
In most cases, translation can be performed incre- 
mentally as the input string is being parsed. 
The aim of this paper is to show that LTAG's local- 
ization of syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap), 
as well as semantic dependencies (such as predicate- 
arguments) combined with the lexiealized property 
of LTAGs are especially attractive for machine trans- 
lation. 
We show how the transfer lexicon is stated. We 
motivate the need for mapping trees instantiated 
with words and with the value of their features ob- 
tained from the derivation tree corresponding to the 
parse of the source sentence. We also show that the 
transfer needs to be stated at different levels: match- 
ing tree families (trees associated to the same pred- 
icate), trees, nodes and therefore their attributes, 
since they are associated with a node. We show how 
not only subcategorization frames but also adjuncts 
are transferred, and how differences of syntactic and 
semantic properties are accounted for ill terms of 
structural discrepancies. Then we illustrate how the 
extended omain of locality enables us to deal with 
these structural discrepancies in the process of ma- 
chine translation.

2 Transfer  Lex icon-  match ing  
two  LTAG Lex icons  
The transfer is stated between the English and 
French LTAG grammars in a lexicon. We rely on 
grammars built from a monolingual perspective, but 
the match between them can be one to many, or 
many to one. 
2.1 Matching elementary trees 
Instead\[ of matching words, we match structures in 
which words have been already lexically inserted. 
This provides interesting disambiguations that could 
not be obtained by a morphological match. For ex- 
ample, there is one morphological English verb leave, 
but the structures associated with it disambiguate 
it between intransitive and transitive leave. Inter- 
estingly, these two predicates receive two different 
French translations: 4

The pairs a4 and c~5 will correctly give the follow- 
ing translations: 
Sohn John 
John l_efi Mary *-~ John a quitlg Mary 
By convention, in the elementary trees, the set of 
morphological flexions of a given word is written sur- 
rounded by baekslashes. For example, \ leave\ stands 
for {leave, leaves, left, ...}. For each word in a mor- 
phological set attributes (such as mode and agree- 
ment) are also specified. When a word in a tree is 
not surrounded by backslahes, it stands for the in- 
fleeted form and not for a morphological set. 
Since lexieal items appearing in the elementary 
structures can be inflected words or a morphological 
set, lexieal items of the two languages are matched 
regardless of whether they exhibit the same morpho- 
4We use standard TAG notation: '1' stands for nodes to 
be substituted, '*' annotates the foot node of an auxiliary tree 
and the hadices hown on the nodes correspond to semantic 
functions. The trees are combined with adjunction and sub- 
stitution. 
Our approach does not depend on the specific representation 
adopted ha this paper. See Abeill6 1990 (b) for an Mternate 
representation. 
logical variations or not. For example, English adjec- 
tives lacking morphological variation appear as such 
in the syntactic and transfer lexicons, while their 
French counterparts are usually morphological sets. 
The word white is thus matched with \blanc\,  stand- 
ing for {blanc, blanche, blancs, blanches). 
Words that are not autonomous entries in the En- 
glish syntactic lexicon (ex: complementizers, light 
verbs or parts of an idiomatic expression), are not 
considered as autonomous entries in the transfer lex- 
icon; for example, no rule needs to match directly 
take or pay with faire, or give with pousser, in order 
to get the right light-verb predicative noun combina- 
tions in the following sentences: 5 
John t.ool~ a walk 
John a fail une promenade (Danlos 1989) 
John pays court_ t? Mary 
~, John fait ia court d Mary (Danlos 1989) 
John ~ ~-~ Jean a poussd un cri 
Some words existing as autonomous entries in the 
English syntactic lexicon do not appear as entries 
in the transfer lexicon because their French coun- 
terpart is a morphological f exion, not a word. For 
example, the future auxiliaries will or shall are not 
translated as such. The tense feature they contribute 
is transferred (as well other syntactic features) and 
the future tense French verbal form will be chosen. 
2.2  Match ing  nodes  
Matching predicates of the two languages as a whole 
is not sufficient. Correspondences between their ar- 
guments must be stated too as shown in the following 
example: 
~6 
~7 
$ VP NPa$ VP I. 
V .NPI$ V PP., / 
I x .  I 
7 
/NP0 S - - ' - ' - ' - '~  S / 
$ vP j---NP0$ VP / \ A t  
/ V  NPI$ V PP, 
"k . "  i / x  
\ ~miss\ ~ ._~manqueA r l  ~NPI~ 
John resembles Mary *-+ John ressemble d Mary 
John misses Mary *-+ Mary manque fi John 
5It has long been noticed that light-verb predicative noun 
combinations are highly langalage-idiosyncratic, nd word-to- 
word transfer rules will inevitably lead to overgeneration r 
unnatural restrictions. 
3 3 
These examples also show that it is not correct 
to match trees where lexical insertion has not al- 
ready been made and therefore the correspondences 
between odes cannot be made on the only basis of 
the subcategorization frame. 
Arguments are matched irectly by the links exist- 
ing between them. Adjuncts are matched indirectly 
by the links existing on the nodes, at which they ad- 
join. For example, in the following correspondence, 
NP0 S - ' -  ~S 
v y 
~,/~e\ A PP ~aimeA I 
the AP node in the English tree is linked to the V 
node of the French tree to account for: 
John is fond of music 
John aime ia mnsique 
John is very fond of music 
John aime beaucoup la musique 
The adjective fond is associated with an AP-type 
auxiliary tree which is paired with a V-type auxiliary 
tree corresponding to the word beaucoup. 
2.3 Match ing  feature  s t ruc tures  
Some feature structures ofthe words appearing inthe 
trees are transferred in the translation process, but 
with the value further specified from the derivation 
(and not with the one from the lexical entry which 
may not be as specific). For example, fish can be 
either singular or plural and is therefore stated as 
such in the lexicon. However, it can get its number 
from the verb-subject agreement constraints, as in 
the following sentences: 
The fish. swim in the pond 
*-+ Les poissons nagent dans I'dtang (plural) 
The fish is good 
Le poisson est bon (singular) 
Agreement features of nouns are lexically matched 
only in the case of two morphological sets. In the ease 
of one (or both) entry being a single inflected word, 
the agreement features depend only on the lexieal 
entry itself and are directly assigned in the transfer 
lexicon: 
\boy\,g \[hum=X\] ~ \gar~on\,N \[nura= X\] 
luggage, N \[hum=sing\] ~ bagages, N Inure = pl\] 
Because of these idiosyncrasies, agreement features 
of verbs are not matched. We will thus rightly have: 
My luggage .0. heavy (singular) 
*-* Mes bagages ont Iourds (plural) 
based on monolingual greement constraints between 
subject and verb. 
Features assigned to the sententiai yoot node (ei- 
ther from lexieal insertion or from S dh~e adjoined ma- 
,'.%," '3  
terial) are transferred or not depending on whether 
they are assigned autonomously !nthe target lan- 
guage or not. The feature tense for example is usu- 
ally transferred, but not the feature~:mode because 
the latter depends on the verb of the matrix sentence 
if the sentence is embedded: 
Jean wants Marie to leave 
~-* Jean veut que Marie parte (Danlos 1989) 
2.4 Match ing  t ree  fami l ies  
In order to transfer both the predicate-argument re- 
lations, and the construction types such as question, 
passive, topicalization etc., it is necessary to be able 
to refer to a specific tree in a tree family. This is done 
by matching the syntactic features by which the dif- 
ferent trees are identified within a tree family, for 
example <passive>, <relative, NPi > or <question, 
NP~ >.6 
As has been noted, transitivity alternations ex- 
hibit striking differences in the two languages. The 
trees in the two families will not necessarily bear the 
same syntactic features; corresponding tree families 
may not include the same number of trees. 
When a syntactic feature of a given tree family 
does not exist for the corresponding tree family in 
the target language, it will be ignored. English trees 
for prepositional passives will thus be matched with 
their corresponding declarative trees in French (un- 
less the English prepositional rgument is matched 
with the French direct object): 
John was given a book by Mary 
Mary a donnd nn livre ~ Jean 
Similarly, the feature <question, NPi > will be 
transferred but not the feature differentiating be- 
tween pied-piping and preposition-stranding i  En- 
glish, since French always pied-pipes: 
Who did Mary give a book to? 
~ Mary a-t-elle donnd un livre? 
When a certain syntactic feature xists for both 
tree families in the two languages, but not for both 
lexical items, it is ignored as well: 
Advantage was taken of this affair by John 
? Patti a ~td tird de cette affaire par Jean 
Jean a tird patti de cette affaire 
Such idiosyncrasies are in fact expected and han- 
dled in our grammars, since they have both their 
constituent s ructures and their syntactic rules iexi- 
calized (see Abeill6 \[1990 (a)\] for a discussion on this 
topic). 
6NPi refers to the noun phrase being extracted, usually 0
for subject, 1for first object etc..

3 Dealing with Structural Dis- 
crepancies 
Units of a LTAG grammar have a large domain of lo- 
cality. Discrepancies in the internal structures being 
matched are in fact expected by our strategy, and no 
special meclhanism is required for them.

I1. is not a problem when an elementary tree of a 
certain constituent structure translates into an ele- 
mentary tree with a different constituent structure 
ix:t the target language, provided they have a simi- 
l~p,r argument structure. For example: idiom ~-+ verb; 
idiom ~ different kind of idiom; verb ~ light-verb 
combination; VP-adverb ~-~ raising verb; S-adverb ?~ 
matrix clause ... as in: 
The baby j_ust fell

Links provide for simultaneous adjunction (or sub- 
stitution) of matching trees at the corresponding 
nodes. For example in the pair 0"11, adjunction of 
an adjective (on N) in the English tree corresponds 
to an adjunction on the French VP:  
John gave a weak cough 
John toussa faiblemenl 
Furthermore lementary structures of the source 
language need not exist in the target language as el- 
ementary structures. For example, there is no French 
counterpart tothe English verb particle combination. 
John called Mary up ~ John a appeid Mary 
3.2 D isc repanc ies  in syntact i c  p rop-  
e r t ies  
Some English predicates do not have the same num- 
ber of arguments as their corresponding French ones. 
In such cases, the pair does not consists of pairs of 
elementary trees but rather pairs of derived trees of 
bounded size. Since the match is performed between 
derived trees, no new elementary trees are introduced 
in the grammars. This addition of pairs of bounded 
derived trees is the only change we have to make to 
the units of the original grammars. 
For example, the adverb hopefully has an S argu- 
ment. Since there is no corresponding French adverb, 
the French verb espdrer (which has two arguments, 
an NP and an S) combined with on will be used: 
hopefully, John will work 
on espgre que Jean travaiilera 
. 1  
O'12

\hopefully I /~  
'~e~sp6rerk ~ S;

In the pair 0"12, hopefully is paired with a derived 
tree corresponding to on esp~re. The English tree for 
hopefully is paired with the result of the substitution 
of on in the subject position of the tree for esp~rer. 
The right hand tree in 0"12 is a derived tree. 
Matching agentless passive with declarative trees 
is done with the same device: 
John was given a book 
~ a donnd un livre h John 
Similar cases occur for verbs exhibiting ergativity 
alternation i one language and but not in the other. 
In this case, a supplementary causative tree has to 
be used for the unaccusative language (see pair 0"13): 
The sun melt____.As the snow 
* le soleil fond la neige 
+-+ le soleil fair fondre la neige 
5 5 
0?13

The right hand tree in al3 is again a derived tree. 
Multicomponent TAG !Joshi \[1987\]) can also be 
used for resolving certain other discrepancies. This 
device is not a new addition, it is already a part of 
the Synchronous TAG framework. 
Conclus ion 
By virtue of their extended omain of locality, T ree  
Adjoining Grammars allow regular correspondences 
between larger structures to be stated without a me- 
diating interlingual representation. The mapping of 
derivation trees from source to target languages, us- 
ing the formalism of synchronous TAGs, makes pos- 
sible to state such direct correspondences. By doing 
so, we are able to match linguistic units with quite 
different internal structures. Furthermore, the fact 
that the grammars are lexicalized enables capturing 
some idiosyncrasies of each language. 
The simplicity and effectiveness of the transfer 
rules in this approach shows that lexicMized TAGs, 
with their extended omain of locality, are very well 
adapted to machine translation. A detailed discus- 
sion of this approach will be provided in an expanded 
version of this paper which will include a discussion 
of the applicability of this method for other pairs of 
languages exhibiting some language phenomena that 
do not arise in the pair considered in this paper.
