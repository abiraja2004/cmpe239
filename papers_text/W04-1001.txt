Abstract 
The understanding and summarization of stories 
remains a challenge, in part because of the 
inability to adequately capture the ?aboutness? of 
information content. This can result in 
inappropriate content selection as well as summary 
incoherence. This talk sketches a general 
framework for narrative summarization that relies 
in part on explo itation of temporal information. I 
will show how this framework can help address 
the above problems. I go on to discuss how 
different levels of narrative structure can provide 
useful information for summarization.
