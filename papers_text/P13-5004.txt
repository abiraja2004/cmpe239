Introduction
Social media like Twitter and micro-blogs provide
a goldmine of text, shallow markup annotations
and network structure. These information sources
can all be exploited together in order to automat-
ically acquire vast amounts of up-to-date, wide-
coverage structured knowledge. This knowledge,
in turn, can be used to measure the pulse of a va-
riety of social phenomena like political events, ac-
tivism and stock prices, as well as to detect emerg-
ing events such as natural disasters (earthquakes,
tsunami, etc.).
The main purpose of this tutorial is to introduce
social media as a resource to the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) community both from a scien-
tific and an application-oriented perspective. To
this end, we focus on micro-blogs such as Twitter,
and show how it can be successfully mined to per-
form complex NLP tasks such as the identification
of events, topics and trends. Furthermore, this in-
formation can be used to build high-end socially
intelligent applications that tap the wisdom of the
crowd on a large scale, thus successfully bridging
the gap between computational text analysis and
real-world, mission-critical applications such as fi-
nancial forecasting and natural crisis management.
Tutorial Outline
1. Social media and the wisdom of the crowd.
We review the resources which will be the focus
of the tutorial, i.e. Twitter and micro-blogging in
general, and present their most prominent and dis-
tinguishing aspects (Kwak et al, 2010; Gouws et
al., 2011), namely: (i) instant short-text messag-
ing, including its specific linguistic characteris-
tics (e.g., non-standard spelling, shortenings, lo-
gograms, etc.) and other features ? i.e., mentions
(@), hashtags (#), shortened URLs, etc.; (ii) a dy-
namic network structure where users are highly
inter-connected and author profile information is
provided along with other metadata. We intro-
duce these properties by highlighting the differ-
ent trade-offs related to resources of this kind,
as well as their comparison with alternative data
publishing platforms ? for instance, highly un-
structured text vs. rich network structure, semi-
structured metadata tagging (like hashtags) vs.
fully-structured linked open data, etc.
2. Analyzing and extracting structured infor-
mation from social media. We provide an in-
depth overview of contributions aimed at tapping
the wealth of information found within Twitter
and other micro-blogs. We first show how so-
cial media can be used for many different NLP
tasks, ranging from pre-processing tasks like PoS
tagging (Gimpel et al, 2011) and Named Entity
Recognition (Ritter et al, 2011) through high-end
discourse (Ritter et al, 2010) and information ex-
traction applications like event detection (Popescu
et al, 2011; Ritter et al, 2012) and topic track-
ing (Lin et al, 2011). We then focus on novel
tasks and challenges opened up by social media
such as geoparsing, which aims to predict the lo-
cation (including its geographic coordinates) of a
message or user based on his posts (Gelernter and
Mushegian, 2011; Han et al, 2012), and methods
to automatically establish the credibility of user-
generated content by making use of contextual and
metadata features (Castillo et al, 2011).
3. Exploiting social media for real-world appli-
cations: trend detection, social sensing and cri-
sis management. We present methods to detect
emerging events and breaking news from social
media (Mathioudakis et al, 2010; Petrovic? et al,
2010, inter alia). Thanks to their highly dynamic
environment and continuously updated content, in
fact, micro-blogs and social networks are capable
of providing real-time information for a wide vari-
5
ety of different social phenomena, including con-
sumer confidence and presidential job approval
polls (O?Connor et al, 2010), as well as stock mar-
ket prices (Bollen et al, 2011; Ruiz et al, 2012).
We focus in particular on applications that use so-
cial media for health surveillance in order to mon-
itor, for instance, flu epidemics (Aramaki et al,
2011), as well as crisis management systems that
leverage them for tracking natural disasters like
earthquakes (Sakaki et al, 2010; Neubig et al,
2011) and tsunami (Zielinski and Bu?rgel, 2012;
Zielinski et al, 2013).
