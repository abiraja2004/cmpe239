Abstract
This paper describes the online tool Phon-
Matrix, which analyzes a word list with re-
spect to the co-occurrence of sounds in a
specified context within a word. The co-
occurrence counts from the user-specified
context are statistically analyzed accord-
ing to a number of association measures
that can be selected by the user. The
statistical values then serve as the input
for a matrix visualization where rows and
columns represent the relevant sounds un-
der investigation and the matrix cells indi-
cate whether the respective ordered pair of
sounds occurs more or less frequently than
expected. The usefulness of the tool is
demonstrated with three case studies that
deal with vowel harmony and similar place
avoidance patterns.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we introduce the PhonMatrix1 tool,
which is designed to visualize co-occurrence con-
straints of sounds within words given a reasonably
sized word list of the language. It is a web-based
implementation of the visualization method pro-
posed in (Mayer et al, 2010a), including some
further development such as an interactive com-
ponent and a range of association measures and
sorting methods to choose from. The original mo-
tivation for this tool is to give linguists the oppor-
tunity to upload their own word lists in order to
visually explore co-occurrence constraints in lan-
guages. The basic idea behind the visual compo-
nent of the tool is to provide for a first, at-a-glance
mode of analysis which can be used to generate
hypotheses about the data by simply looking at the
visualization matrices.

Phonotactic constraints in languages abound.
One of the most well-known and wide-spread con-
straints is commonly referred to as vowel har-
mony (van der Hulst and van de Weijer, 1995). In
vowel harmony languages, vowels are separated
into groups where vowels of the same group tend
to co-occur within words, while vowels from dif-
ferent groups rarely co-occur. Likewise, in some
languages there are patterns of consonant har-
mony (Hansson, 2010) that show a similar behav-
ior with respect to consonants. Less common are
cases of ?synharmonism? (Trubetzkoy, 1967, p.
251) where both vowels and consonants form such
groups and words usually only contain sounds
from the same group (e.g., only front vowels and
palatalized consonants). Whereas vowel harmony
patterns are easily detectable in many harmonic
languages due to the harmonic alternants in af-
fixes, other co-occurrence constraints are less ob-
vious. This is especially true for disharmonic pat-
terns, the most famous of which is the principle
of Similar Place Avoidance (SPA) in Semitic con-
sonantal roots (Greenberg, 1950). Recent studies
have shown that this principle is not only active
in Semitic languages, where it was already known
by grammarians in the Middle Ages, but is a more
widespread tendency among the languages of the
world (Pozdniakov and Segerer, 2007; Mayer et
al., 2010b). One of the reasons why statistical con-
straints like SPA are more difficult to detect is the
fact that they exhibit many frequent counterexam-
ples and are therefore less easily spotted as a gen-
eral (albeit statistical) tendency.
In our view, there are many more phonotactic
constraints that wait to be discovered by linguists.
With the availability of language data in electronic
format such tendencies can be automatically pro-
cessed and presented to the user in a form that
allows for an easy exploration of the results in a
short period of time. Thus a larger number of
phonotactic contexts can be explored in order to
73
find potential patterns in the data. The PhonMa-
trix tool is part of an ongoing effort to integrate
methods and techniques from the field of visual
analytics (Thomas and Cook, 2005) into linguis-
tic research. The present tool will be gradually
augmented with further functionalities in order to
enhance its usefulness.
2 Related work
A related tool that quantifies the co-occurrence of
sounds in a given corpus is the Vowel Harmony
Calculator (Harrison et al, 2004). The major dif-
ference between PhonMatrix and the Vowel Har-
mony Calculator is that the latter is restricted to
the context of vowel harmony and requires the user
to input the harmony classes beforehand whereas
PhonMatrix is designed to detect these classes
by making potential harmonic patterns more eas-
ily perceptible to the user. The Vowel Harmony
Calculator quantifies the notion of vowel har-
mony for the input corpus by giving the percent-
age of harmonic words and the harmony threshold.
The harmony threshold is the percentage of words
that would be expected to be harmonic purely by
chance. The output of the Vowel Harmony Cal-
culator consists of a list of values (number of
polysyllabic words, harmony threshold, percent-
age of harmonic words, harmony index, among
other things) but does not give any information
about the harmonic strength of individual vowel
pairs. In short, the Vowel Harmony Calculator is
a way to quantify the notion of harmony given the
harmony classes of the language whereas Phon-
Matrix is intended to help detect such patterns.
3 System overview
PhonMatrix is a web-based visualization tool that
statistically analyzes sound co-occurrences within
words and displays the result in a symmetric sound
matrix. The statistical components are written
in Python whereas the visualization part is in
Javascript, using the D3 library (Bostock et al,
2011). Before discussing the individual steps of
the system in more detail we will give a brief
overview of the overall processing pipeline (see
Figure 1).
In the first step, the user has to upload the text
file containing the word list that serves as the in-
put to the analysis process. Text files have to be
encoded in UTF-8 and list only one word per line.
For a meaningful analysis the words should be
given in some phonemic transcription (e.g., using
IPA).2
After the file has been uploaded to the server all
symbols in the word list are analyzed according
to their unigram and bigram frequencies. These
frequencies are used to infer an automatic dis-
tinction between vowels, consonants and infre-
quent symbols. Infrequent symbols are consid-
ered to be noise in the data and can be ignored
for further processing. A distinction between vow-
els and consonants is automatically inferred from
the word list by means of Sukhotin?s algorithm
(Sukhotin, 1962). The results of Sukhotin?s algo-
rithm are presented to the user together with the
frequency counts of the individual symbols in the
word list.
In the third step, the user can make changes to
the automatic classification of symbols into vow-
els and consonants and exclude infrequent sym-
bols from further consideration. The subsequent
calculations of co-occurrence values are mostly
based on the distinction of input symbols into con-
sonants (C) and vowels (V). Users can choose
among a number of options that define the con-
text for the co-occurrence calculations.3 Two of
those options will be discussed in more detail in
this paper (vowel co-occurrences in VCV and CC
sequences). Depending on the user?s choice, the
co-occurrences in the selected context are calcu-
lated and analyzed with respect to a number of sta-
tistical association measures from which the user
can choose one for the visualization.
In the last step, the results of the statistical anal-
ysis of the co-occurrence counts are displayed in a
quadratic matrix of sounds. The rows and columns
of the matrix represent the individual sounds that
are relevant for the selected context (e.g., vow-
els in the context of VCV sequences). The rows
thereby stand for the first members of the relevant
sound pairs, whereas the columns contain the sec-
ond members. Each cell of the matrix then shows
the result for the pair of sounds in the respective
row and column.
The final result is a visualization of the co-
occurrence matrix with rows and columns sorted
according to the similarity of the sound vectors
and statistical values represented as colors in the
matrix cells. The visualization features a number

4 PhonMatrix components
PhonMatrix consists of three main components:
preprocessing (including vowel-consonant dis-
tinction), statistical analysis of co-occurrence
counts and visualization. In what follows, we will
describe each component in more detail, with spe-
cial emphasis on the visualization component.
4.1 Vowel-consonant distinction
Most of the co-occurrence restrictions that might
be of interest make reference to a distinction be-
tween vowels and consonants. Since a manual
classification of all sounds in the input into vowels
and consonants is a tedious task (especially with
a larger number of symbols), the first component
deals with an automatic inference of such a dis-
tinction. Many methods have been discussed in
the literature on how to discriminate vowels from
consonants on the basis of their distribution in
texts. Many of them involve many lines of code
and are computationally demanding. Yet there is a
very simple and fast algorithm that yields reason-
ably good results (Sukhotin, 1962; Guy, 1991).
The basic idea of Sukhotin?s algorithm is that
vowels and consonants have the tendency not to
occur in groups within words but to alternate.
Based on the additional assumption that the most
frequent symbol in the text is a vowel, the algo-
rithm iteratively selects the symbol which occurs
most frequently adjacent to a vowel and deter-
mines it to be a consonant. The algorithm stops
if no more consonants can be selected because no
co-occurrence counts with any remaining vowel
are positive. Although the algorithm is quite old
and very simple, it gives reasonably good results
(Goldsmith and Xanthos, 2009; Guy, 1991; Sas-
soon, 1992). PhonMatrix makes use of Sukhotin?s
algorithm as a preprocessing step to give a first
guess of the class for each symbol, which the user
can then modify if it turns out to be wrong. It
mainly serves to speed up the classification step.
4.2 Co-occurrence statistics
With the distinction of symbols into vowels and
consonants at hand, the user can then select a rel-
evant context for the co-occurrence counts. The
relevant context can be chosen from a list of pre-
defined options. Here we will illustrate the statis-
tical analysis with the context of VCV sequences
to investigate vowel harmony in Turkish. The in-
put consists of 20,968 orthographic words from
the Turkish New Testament.4 The tool automati-
cally extracts all VCV sequences in the words and
counts the co-occurrences of sounds in these se-
quences. The counts are then summarized in a
quadratic contingency table and can be used for
further statistical analyses.
In our experiments, two measures turned out to
be especially useful for the detection of potential
patterns: the probability and ? values. The ? value
is a normalized ?2 measure which allows for an
easier mapping of values to the color scale because
it is always between ?1 and 1.5 The ? values for
the vowels in the Turkish text are shown in Table
1. Apart from probability and ? values, the user
can also choose among a number of other asso-
ciation measures such as pointwise mutual infor-
mation, likelihood ratios or t-scores (Manning and
Schu?tze, 1999).
4.3 Visualization component
The input to the visualization component is a ma-
trix of association measures for each sound pair
in the relevant context. Two additional steps have
to be performed in order to arrive at the final
matrix visualization: 1) the rows and columns
of the matrix have to be sorted in a meaning-
ful way; 2) the association measures have to be
mapped to visual variables. For the matrix ar-
rangement, we decided to have the same order of
symbols for the rows and columns. The order
of symbols is determined by a clustering of the
4Turkish orthography represents the modern pronuncia-
tion with a high degree of accuracy.
5Apart from this, ? makes good use of the off-diagonal
cells in the contingency tables (Church and Gale, 1991).

symbols based on the similarity of their row val-
ues. The clustering is performed with the Python
scipy.cluster.hierarchy package from
the SciPy library. As a default setting Ward?s al-
gorithm (Ward, 1963) is used but other clustering
algorithms can also be easily integrated.
Whereas the preprocessing steps and the data-
driven sorting of rows and columns have been
written in Python, the actual visualization of the
results in the browser is implemented in Javascript
using the D3 library (Bostock et al, 2011). The
association measures and the order of the sym-
bols are referenced as Javascript variables in the
visualization document. The data is then automat-
ically bound to DOM elements of the HTML doc-
ument through the D3 data operator. The mapping
from association measures to color values is made
with the linear scale method from the d3.scale
package. Scale methods map from an input do-
main to an output range. The input domain for the
? values is the interval [?1; 1], while the output
range can be given as a color scale ranging from
one color to the other. For the ? values we de-
cided to use two unipolar scales, one from ?1 to
0 (red) and the other from 0 to +1 (blue). In order
to reserve a larger color range for the densely pop-
ulated area of low values we did not linearly map
the numerical association measures but used the
square roots of the numerical values as the input
for the scale function. Additionally, the sign of the
? value, which shows whether the co-occurrence
of a certain symbol pair occurs more (+) or less
(?) frequently than expected, is displayed in the
matrix cell.6 The result of the matrix visualization
for the ? values of the vowels in Turkish VCV se-
quences is shown in Section 5.1.
6The algebraic sign is displayed in white and therefore
stands out more clearly with higher absolute ? values.
The matrix visualization also features some in-
teraction to explore the results in more detail. On
mouse-over, the respective matrix cell shows the
actual values that serve as the input for the data
mapping process. Additionally, the row and col-
umn labels are highlighted in order to show more
clearly which pair of symbols is currently selected
(see Figure 2). The size of the matrix can also
be adjusted to the user?s needs with the help of
a slider above the matrix. Next to the slider is a
dropdown menu from which users can choose the
association measure that they want to be displayed
in the visualization.
5 Case studies
After the description of the PhonMatrix system we
will illustrate the usefulness of the visualization of
co-occurrence patterns in sounds with three case
studies. They are presented as a proof of concept
that the visualization component allows for an at-
a-glance exploration of potential patterns. The vi-
sualization part is thereby not considered to be a
replacement of more detailed linguistic investiga-
tions but rather serves as a way to explore a mul-
titude of different contexts and data in a compara-
tively short period of time. After a suspicious pat-
tern has been detected it is indispensable to look
at the actual data to see whether the visualization
result is an artifact of the method or data at hand
or whether the detected pattern is an interesting
phonotactic feature of the language under consid-
eration.
5.1 Turkish vowel harmony
The first case study shows the results of the VCV
sequences in Turkish described above. For this
purpose the vowels a, e, i, o, u, o?, u?, ? are selected
as the relevant sounds that are to be compared in

the visualization. Figure 2 shows the results for
the ? values that have been computed from the
co-occurrence counts of the symbols in VCV se-
quences. The arrangement of the symbols in the
matrix rows and columns already show a distinc-
tion between front (the first four vowels) and back
(the last four vowels) vowels, reflecting the palatal
harmony in Turkish. This distinction can best be
seen when looking at the e- and a-columns where
the top four vowels all have positive ? values for
e and negative ? values for a, whereas the bottom
four vowels show the opposite behavior. On closer
inspection, the labial harmony for high vowels can
also be seen in the matrix visualization. From top
to bottom there are always pairs of vowels that
take the same harmonic vowel, starting with (o?,
u?) taking u? and followed by (e, i) taking i, (o, u)
taking u and finally (a, ?) taking ?. The usefulness
of the visualization component to detect such pat-
terns can best be seen when comparing Figure 2
with Table 1, which contains the same informa-
tion.
5.2 Finnish vowel harmony
The second case study shows that the harmonic
patterns can also be detected in orthographic
words of the Finnish Bible text. Finnish differs
from Turkish in having only one type of harmony
(palatal harmony) and neutral vowels, i.e., vowels
that do not (directly) participate in the harmony
process. As a different underlying association
measure for the visualization consider the proba-
bility values in Figure 3. For probability values

we have chosen a bipolar color scale ranging from
white (for 0) over green (for 0.5) to blue (for 1).
The probability matrix clearly shows the relevant
blocks of vowels that mark the harmony groups.7
The clustering algorithm separates the back vow-
els (first three vowels o, a, u) from the front vowels
(vowels four to six, o?, y, a?) and the neutral vowels
(e, i). The blocks along the main diagonal of the
matrix show the harmonic pattern among the har-
mony groups, whereas the neutral vowels do not
display any regular behavior.
5.3 Maltese verbal roots
PhonMatrix is not only useful to find vowel har-
mony patterns. The third case study shows that
other co-occurrence constraints such as SPA can
also be detected. To illustrate this, we show the
visualization of CC patterns in a comprehensive
list of Maltese verbal roots (Spagnol, 2011). The
consonant matrix in Figure 4 shows two clusters,
with one cluster (the first twelve consonants in
the top row) containing labial and dorsal and the
other cluster (the last eleven consonants) compris-
ing only coronal consonants.8 The visualization
also reveals that, unlike in vowel harmony, conso-
nants from the same cluster do not occur next to
each other in the CC sequences, as shown by the
red blocks in the top left and bottom right. This is
exactly what SPA would predict.
7The+/? signs in the matrix are taken from the ? values.
8The consonants are given in their orthographic represen-
tation (Borg and Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997, p. 299).

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented PhonMatrix, a
web-based, interactive visualization tool for in-
vestigating co-occurrence restrictions of sounds
within words. The case studies of vowel harmony
and SPA have shown that interesting patterns in
the data can easily be seen only by looking at the
matrix visualizations.
