Abstract 
Query and document representation is a 
key problem for information retrieval and 
filtering. The vector space model (VSM) 
has been widely used in this domain. But 
the VSM suffers from high dimensionality. 
The vectors built from documents always 
have high dimensionality and contain too 
much noise. In this paper, we present a 
novel method that reduces the dimensional-
ity using multilingual resource. We intro-
duce a new metric called TC to measure the 
term consistency constraints. We deduce a 
TC matrix from the multilingual corpus and 
then use this matrix together with the term-
by-document matrix to do the Latent Se-
mantic Indexing (LSI). By adopting differ-
ent TC threshold, we can truncate the TC 
matrix into small size and thus lower the 
computational cost of LSI. The experimen-
tal results show that this dimensionality re-
duction method improves the retrieval per-
formance significantly. 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Basic concepts 
The vast amount of electronic information that is 
available today requires effective techniques for 
accessing relevant information from it. The meth-
odologies developed in information retrieval aim at 
devising effective means to extract relevant docu-
ments in a collection when a user query is given. In 
information retrieval and filtering, Query and 
document representation is a key problem and 
many techniques have been developed. Among 
these techniques, the vector space model (VSM) 
proposed by Salton (1971; 1983) has been widely 
used. In the VSM, a document is represented by a 
vector of terms. The cosine of the angle between 
two document vectors indicates the similarity be-
tween the corresponding documents. A smaller 
angle corresponds to a larger cosine value and in-
dicates higher document similarity. A query, which 
describes the information need, is encoded as a 
vector as well. Retrieval of documents that satisfy 
the information need is achieved by finding the 
documents most similar to the query, or equiva-
lently, the document vectors closest to the query 
vector. There are several advantages to this ap-
proach beyond its mathematical simplicity. Above 
all, it is efficient to compute and store the word 
counts. This is one reason that why VSM is widely 
used for query and document representation. But 
this method has problem that the vectors built from 
documents always have high dimensionality and 
contain too much noise. The high dimensionality 
causes high computational and memory require-
ments while noise in the vectors degrades the sys-
tem performance. 
1.2 Related works 
To address these problems, many dimensionality 
reduction techniques have been applied to query 
and document representation. Among these tech-
niques, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deer-
wester et al, 1990; Hofmann, 1999; Ding, 2000; 
Jiang and Littman, 2000; Ando, 2001; Kokiopou-
lou and Saad, 2004; Lee et al, 2006) is a well-
known approach. LSI constructs a smaller docu-
ment matrix that retains only the most important 
information from the original by using the Singular 
Value Decomposition (SVD). Many modifications 
have been made to this approach (Hofmann, 1999; 
Ding, 2000; Jiang and Littman, 2000; Kokiopoulou 
613
and Saad, 2004; Sun et al, 2004; Husbands et al, 
2005). Among them, IRR (Ando and Lee, 2001) is 
a subspace-projection method that counteracts ten-
dency to ignore minority-class documents. This is 
done by repeatedly rescaling vectors to amplify the 
presence of documents poorly represented in pre-
vious iterations. 
 In concept indexing (CI) (Karypis and Han, 
2000) method, the original set of documents is first 
clustered into k similar groups, and then for each 
group, the centroid vector (i.e., the vector obtained 
by averaging the documents in the group) is used 
as one of the k axes of the lower dimensional space. 
The key motivation behind this dimensionality re-
duction approach is the view that each centroid 
vector represents a concept present in the collec-
tion, and the lower dimensional representation ex-
presses each document as a function of these con-
cepts. George and Han (2000) extend concept in-
dexing in the context of supervised dimensionality 
reduction. To capture the concept, phrase also has 
been used as indexing entries (Mao and Chu, 2002).  
The LPI method (Isbell and Viola, 1999) tries to 
discover the local structure and obtains a compact 
document representation subspace that best detects 
the essential semantic structure. The LPI uses Lo-
cality Preserving Projections (LPP) (Xiaofei He 
and Partha, 2003) to learn a semantic space for 
document representation. Xiaofei He et al, (2004) 
try to get sets of highly-related words, queries and 
documents are represented by their distance to 
these sets. These algorithms have successfully re-
duced the dimensionality and improve the retrieval 
performance but at the mean time they led to a 
high computational complexity.  
1.3 Our method 
In this study, we propose a novel method that re-
duces the dimensionality using multilingual re-
source. We first introduce a new metric called TC 
to measure the term consistency constraints. We 
use this metric to deduce a TC matrix from the 
multilingual corpus. Then we combine this matrix 
to the term-by-document matrix and do the Latent 
Semantic Indexing. By adopting different TC 
threshold, we can truncate the TC matrix into small 
size and thus lower the computational cost of LSI.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the dimensionality reduc-
tion method using multilingual resource. Section 3 
shows the experimental results to evaluate the di-
mensionality reduction method. Finally, we pro-
vide conclusions and remarks of future work in 
Section 4. 
2 Dimensionality reduction using multi-
lingual resource 
2.1 Motivation 
As mentioned above, the queries and documents 
are represented by vectors of terms. The weight of 
each term indicates its contribution to the vectors. 
Many weighting schemes have been proposed. The 
simplest form is to use the term-frequency (TF) as 
the term weight. In this condition, a document can 
be represented as a vector ),...,,( 21 ntftftfd =
r
, where 
is the frequency of the ith term in the document. 
A widely used refinement to this model is to 
weight each term based on its inverse document 
frequency (IDF) in the documents collection. This 
is commonly done by multiplying the frequency of 
each term i by , where N is the total 
number of documents in the collection, and is 
the number of documents that contain the ith term. 
This leads to the TF-IDF representation of the 
documents. Although the TF-IDF weighting 
scheme has many variants (Buckley, 1985; Berry 
et al, 1999; Robertson et al, 1999), the idea is the 
same one that uses the statistical information such 
as TF and IDF to calculate the term weight of 
vectors.  
itf
)/log( idfN
idf
This kind of statistical information is independ-
ence with languages. For example, in one language, 
say La, we have a vocabulary Va = {w1a, w2a, ?, 
wna} and a documents collection Da = {d1a, d2a,?, 
dma }. If this documents collection has a parallel 
corpus in language Lb, say, Db = {d1b, d2b,?, dmb } 
and a vocabulary Vb = {w1b, w2b, ?, wnb}. When 
we put a query Qka = {qk1a, qk2a ,?, qkla } (qkia ?Va) 
into an information retrieval system. The informa-
tion retrieval system will converts the query Qka 
and the documents in the collection Da into vectors. 
By calculating the similarity between query Qka 
and each document dia, the system selects the 
documents whose similarity is higher than a 
threshold as the results Rka. If we translate the 
query Qka into language Lb and get query Qkb, when 
putting the Qkb into the same information retrieval 
system, we get the retrieval results Rkb. Since the 
Qka and Qkb contain the same content and only ex-
pressed in different languages. We expect that Rka 
614
and Rkb will contain the same content. If this as-
sumption holds, the vocabulary which is used to 
build queries and documents vectors should have 
high representative ability. Since the weight of 
each term in the vector is calculated by the statisti-
cal information such as TF and IDF. If the vocabu-
lary Va and Vb have high representative ability, 
their statistical information will be consistent as 
well. This is the main motivation of our dimen-
sionality reduction method. 
2.2 Dimensionality reduction method 
The most straightforward way to measure the 
word?s representability in multilingual resource is 
to calculate the TF and IDF of each word in differ-
ent languages. But this method has one problem 
that the TF-IDF scheme is dedicated for each sin-
gle document, the same word will have different 
weight in different documents. It is impractical to 
impose the consistency constraint to every docu-
ment. Even we can do that, this method still has the 
drawback that it is very difficult to port to another 
documents collection. To address this problem, we 
consider the whole documents collection as one 
single document. In this condition, the IDF will be 
a fixed number. 
We introduce a new metric to measure the term 
consistency called TC. Figure 1 and Figure 2 illus-
trate the basic idea. In these figures, the curve La 
shows the word logarithmic frequency in the 
documents collection of language La, the curve Lb 
shows the corresponding translation?s logarithmic 
frequency in the documents collection of language 
Lb. TCi and TCj are the term consistency of wi and 
wj respectively.  
Figure 1 shows the TC in normal condition that 
the average word frequency in language a is proxi-
mate to that of language b. In this case, the TC is 
defined as below:

as below:

3.1 Training and test corpora 
The training corpus 
Data Consortium (http://www.chin , ab-
?2004-863-
 (?2003-863-006?). It is 
a C
breviate as CLDC). Its code number is 
009?. This parallel corpus contains parallel texts in 
Chinese, English and Japanese. It is aligned to sen-
tence level. The sentence alignment is manually 
verified and the sampling examination shows the 
accuracy reaches 99.9%.  
The experiments are conducted on two test cor-
pora. The first one is the information retrieval test 
corpus gotten from CLDC
hinese IR corpus and contains 20 topics for test. 
Each topic has key words and description and nar-
rative. The second one is the Reuters 2001 data 
(http://about.reuters.com/researchandstandards/cor
pus/ ). This corpus is a collection of about 810,000 
Reuters English news stories from August 20, 1996 
to August 19, 1997. It was used by the TREC-10
Filtering Tracks (Robertson and Soboroff, 2002). 
In TREC-10, 84 Reuters categories were used to 
simulate user profiles.  
The evaluate measure is a version of van 
Rijsbergen(1979)?s F measure with ?=1(we de-
note it as F1). 
3.2 Experimental results 
The table1 and table2 show the experimental re-
sults conducted on Chinese and English test Cor-
pus respectively. In these tables, we compare our 
method with basic LSI and LPI (Xiaofei et.al, 
2004). In the table1, the ?C-E? means the TC ma-
trix gotten from Chinese-English training collec-
tion (deduced from the trilingual training corpus). 
The ?C-J? means that the TC matrix gotten from 
Chinese-Japanese training collection, and so force 
the ?C-E-J?. All the TC matrices have been normal-
ized to range from 0 to 1. The threshold ? is used 
to truncate the TC matrix into small size. Bigger ? 
corresponds to smaller truncated TC matrix. Note 
that here ? is discrete since for some ?, the size of 
truncated matrix is very similar. For example, 
when ? = 0.85 and ? = 0.9, the size of truncated TC 
matrices are the same one.

Table2. F1 measure of English test corpus 
 
From the experimental results, we can see that 
our method make great enhancement to the basic 
LSI method. And our method also outperforms the 
LPI method in both test corpora. Comparing the 
performance on different training collection, we 
can find that the difference is subtle. In Chinese 
test corpus, the TC matrix gotten from C-E-J train-
ing collection get the best performance (F1=0.4226) 
at ?=0.45 while the C-E test collection get 0.4204 
616
at ?=0.5 and the C-J test collection get 0.4185 at 
?=0.45. For the English test corpus, the trilingual 
training collection also gets the best performance. 
But the difference between bilingual and trilingual 
training collection is also subtle (E-C-J: F1=0.3734, 
E-C: F1=0.3698, E-J: F1=0.3651). In the English 
test corpus, all the training collection get the best 
performance at ?=0.45.  
As mentioned before, the bigger ? means the 
smaller size of the truncated TC matrix. While 
small size of the truncated TC matrix means low 
computational cost and high system speed. This is 
one of the advantages of our method over the tradi-
tional LSI method. We conducted some experi-
ments to test the system speed on different thresh-
old ?. We use the number of documents per sec-
ond (docs/s) to denote this kind of system speed. 
The experiment is conducted on the personal com-
puter with a Pentium (R) 4 processor @2.8GHz, 
256 KB cache and 512 MB memory. Table 3 
shows the experimental results that the ? vs. sys-
tem speed and Figure 3 illustrates the F1 measure

4 Conclusions 
In this paper, we present a novel method that re-
duces the dimensionality using multilingual re-
source. We deduce a TC matrix from the multilin-
gual corpus and then truncate it to small size ac-
cording to different TC threshold. Then we use the 
truncated matrix together with the term-by-
document matrix to do the LSI analysis. Since the 
truncated TC matrix is sorted by word representa-
tive ability. It will contain less noise than the origi-
nal term-by-document matrix. The experimental 
results have shown the effectiveness of this method. 
In the future, we will try to find the optimal 
truncate threshold ? automatically. And since it 
is more difficult to get the parallel corpora than 
comparable corpora, we will explore using com-
parable corpora to do the dimensionality reduc-
tion.
