Abstract 
There is an increasing need for document 
search mechanisms capable of matching a 
natural language query with documents 
written in a different language. Recently, we 
conducted several experiments aimed at 
comparing various methods of incorporating a 
cross-linguistic capability to existing 
information retrieval (IR) systems. Our results 
indicate that translating queries with off-the- 
shelf machine translation systems can result in 
relatively good performance. But the results 
also indicate that other methods can perfonn 
even better. More specifically, we tested a 
probabilistic translation model of the kind 
proposed by Brown & al. \[2\]. The parameters 
of that system had been estimated 
automatically on a different, unrelated, corpus 
of parallel texts. After we augmented it with a 
small bilingual dictionary, this probabilistic 
translation model outperformed machine 
translation systems on our cross-language IR 
task. 
1. Introduction 
Adequate text processing systems have 
become widely available for most natural 
languages. While English remains the 
dominant language on the Intemet, the 
relative share of other languages now appears 
to be on the rise. The network has become 
truly multilingual. This situation has created 
an acute need for tools capable of performing 
language-sensitive s arch in multilingual 
databases. In particular, there is a need for 
tools capable of performing cross-language 
information retrieval (CLIR), that is, of 
matching an information query written in one 
particular language with documents hat may 
be written in one or several different 
languages. 
Given such a need, the solution that 
immediately comes to mind is to translate the 
information query using a machine translation 
(MT) system, and to feed the resulting 
translation into a classical monolingual IR 
system. 
However, it should be stressed that MT and IR 
have widely divergent concerns. First, observe 
that MT systems are expected to produce 
syntactically correct ranslations and that they 
tend to spend a lot of effort trying to attain 
that rather elusive goal. On the other hand, 
current IR systems tend not to care about 
grammar : for them texts are mostly viewed as 
vectors of content words. Second, note that 
MT systems are expected to select one of the 
many translations that words may have. For 
example, in translating the English word 
"organic" the MT process will be led to select 
between the French words "organique" 
and"biologique". Generally speaking, this 
selection process is very difficult and MT 
systems often end up selecting the wrong 
target language quivalent. Here again what 
the MT system is expected to do turns out to 
be unnecessary and maybe undesirable from 
an IR point of view. As a case in point, 
classical IR systems often perform a query 
expansion process by which certain query 
terms/words are mapped onto several 
equivalent or related index terms. Not 
surprisingly, such a process could well make 
provision for mapping the query word 
"organique" onto the two index terms 
"organique" and "biologique" so as to account 
for (partial) synonymy between these words. 
In other words, MT systems attempt to 
systematically eradicate translational 
ambiguity instead of taking advantage of it to 
capture synonymy relations. 
At the opposite nd of the spectrum, MT is 
replaced with a simple bilingual dictionary 
lookup. To that end, one can use either an 
ordinary general-purpose dictionary, a 
technical terminology database, or both. 
Because of the fact that in any sizable 
dictionary most words receive many 
18 
translations, the dictionary approach will in 
effect subject the query to a rather massive 
expansion process. The resulting target 
language query is likely engender a lot of 
noise (irrelevant documents that get 
retrieved), mostly due to the fact that in each 
dictionary entry some of the translations can 
correspond to different meanings of the source 
language word. For example, the English 
word "drug" is translated in French as 
"drogue" (an illegal substance) or as 
"mgdicament" (a legal medicine) depending 
on the context. There is most often no explicit 
clue in the query that would allow one to 
choose the appropriate meaning. 
Yet another approach is to determine 
translational equivalence automatically, on the 
basis of a corpus of parallel texts (that is, a 
corpus made up of source texts and their 
translations). One way of doing this is to start 
by establishing translation correspondences 
between units larger than words, typically 
sentences. There are now well-known 
methods for aligning the sentences of parallel 
corpora (Gale & Church \[6\], Simard, Foster 8~ 
Isabelle \[10\]). Then, the translational 
equivalence of a given pair of words can be 
estimated by their degree of co-occurrence in 
parallel sentences. Compared to the previous 
approaches, this has the following advantages: 
- There is no need to acquire or to compile a 
bilingual dictionary or a complete MT 
system. 
- Word translations are made sensitive to the 
domain, as embodied by the training corpus. 
- As we will see below, it is relatively easy to 
obtain a suitable degree of query expansion 
based on translational mbiguity. 
In the next section, we describe the structure 
of a probabilistic translation model that can 
calculate pule), the probability of observing 
wordfj as part of the translation of sentence . 
Given a query e, we can then select he n best- 
scoring values offj as the set of index terms in 
the target language. This method will be 
compared to the other two mentioned above. 
2. A Probabilistie Translation Model 
Any source language input e can usually be 
translated in a great many different ways. 
Machine translation systems are expected to 
select but one particular translation f for each 
input. In the current state of the art, unaided 
MT is generally unable to produce high- 
quality translations: human translators remain 
mostly unchallenged. Moreover, it has been 
shown repeatedly that human translators 
seldom find it practical to post-edit MT 
output: the machine has just made too many 
wrong or questionable decisions. 
If the goal is to help human translators, it is 
advisable to stop short of producing a full- 
blown automatic translation. There is no point 
in having the machine spontaneously propose 
a detailed target language syntactic structure 
unless there is at least a reasonably good 
chance that the translator will want to use it. 
Similarly, there is no point in having the 
machine select arget language quivalents for 
all source language words unless most of 
these equivalents are likely to be retained by 
the translator. 
In recent years it has been shown that existing 
MT techniques can produce useful results 
when they are applied to tasks that amount o 
somewhat less than translation proper. In 
previous work, we have shown that 
probabilistic translation models such as those 
of Brown et al \[2\] could be used as the key 
component of various translation support 
tools. Specifically, our work on the TransTalk 
project \[1, 4\] has established that such models 
could become instrumental in improving the 
process of automatically transcribing a spoken 
translation. And our ongoing work on the 
TransType project \[5\] indicates that models of 
the same kind can drive typing aids for 
translators. 
A key feature of such applications i that they 
do not expect he machine to volunteer a full- 
fledged translation on its own. Rather, the 
machine is only expected to restrict he range 
of possible translations so as to make it easier 
to guess what the intentions of the human 
translator are. 
? For example, in certain incarnations of the 
TransTalk system, the translation model is 
used as a means of answering the following 
question: given a source language sentence , 
what is the likelihood of observing the word f
in any target language sentence f that 
constitutes a valid translation of e? If e is an 
English sentence that contains the word 
"horses", then the likelihood that "chevaux" 
(the most direct equivalent for "horses") will 
appear in a French translation ffof e is much 
19 
greater than the a priori likelihood of 
observing "chevaux" in a random French 
sentence. In contrast, there is no reason to 
expect that the likelihood of observing 
"cheveux" (an acoustically close word that 
means "hair") in f will be significantly 
altered: 
p(chevaux E f I horses ~ e) > p(chevaux ~ f) 
p(cheveu x ~ f I horses ~ e) =p(cheveux ~ f) 
TransTalk makes use of this fact to help 
resolve the acoustic ambiguity between t\]he 
French words "chevaux'" and "cheveux". 
From the point of view of translation support, 
doing somewhat less than full-blown MT is 
likely to achieve more. 
In this paper, we want to argue that CLIR is 
facing a similar situation in that subjecting the 
source language query to a process that stops 
short of producing a full-blown target 
language query can result in a good retrieval 
performance. For the purpose of CLIR, our 
goal is to obtain a set of words that are the 
best translations of an original query. This 
goal may be achieved by using probabilistic 
translation models of the kind used in our 
TransTalk and TransSearch. 
By translation model, we mean a mechanism 
which associates to each source language 
sentence(or query) e a probability distribution 
p(fle) on the sentences (or queries) f of the 
target language. A precise description of a 
family of such models can be found in Brown 
& al. \[2\]. The model we will be using for the 
experiments reported here is basically their 
"Model 1". In this model, a source e and !its 
translation f are connected through an 
alignment a, that is a mapping of the words of 
e onto those of f. If e = e 1, e r .... e t and f =.f, 
f2, .... f .  then aj will be used to refer to the 
particular position in e that is connected with 
position j in f (for example, a2 = 4 expresses 
the fact thatf~ is connected with e,) and e, will 
be used to refer to the word in e at position a r 
The probability p(fle) is decomposed as a sum 
over all possible alignments: 
p(fle) = ~a~ Ap(f, ale) 
The conditional probability of f under 
alignment a given e can be analysed as 
follows: 
p(f, ale)= p(fla,e)p(ale) =Ke,r p(fla,e) 
The latter equality stems from the fact that in 
model 1, all alignments are considered 
equiprobable (see below). Consequently p(ale) 
is a constant Kel equal to 1 over the total 
number of alignements. 
The core of the model is tf3~le), the lexical 
probability that some word e~ is translated as 
word fr The value of p(fla,e) depends mostly 
on the product of the lexical probabilities of 
each word pair connected by the alignment: 
p(fla,e) = Cr~ lq j=l,m t~le , ) 
where Cr, ~ is a constant that accounts for 
certain dependencies between the respective 
lengths of sentences e and f (mostly irrelevant 
here). 
The probability of observing wordfj in f under 
a particular alignment a is: 
p~.la,e) = t~le ?) 
And the probability of observing word fj in f 
under any alignment is: 
PU le) = ~i=l,l t(~le,) 
Since all alignments are considered 
equiprobable, we can simply sum up the 
values obtained by connecting f~ to each word 
e e e~ .... e~ of e. In other words, the 
probability of observing a particular word in a 
given position in f is established as the total of 
the lexical contributions of each word of e. 
The parameters of our translation model are 
estimated from a bilingual parallel corpus in 
which each sentence has been aligned with the 
corresponding sentence(s) of the other 
language. Such alignments can be produced 
using algorithms uch as the one described in 
\[10\]. Given such alignments we can estimate 
reasonable values for the parameters t(~le) 
using the Expectation Maximization 
algorithm, as described in \[2\]. The model used 
in the experiments reported here has been 
trained using 8 years of the Canadian Hansard 
(parliamentary debates), that is, 
approximately 50 million words in each 
language. 
Obviously, a translation model in which all 
alignments are considered equiprobable, like 
Model 1, can only be a very coarse model. 
The lexical translation probabilities t~le)  are 
independent from the positions offj and e i. As 
a result, for any j, j ' ,  the model assigns the 
20 
same value to p~le) and to pf~.le). In other 
words, the model is completely blind to 
syntax. This means that it is much too weak to 
generate full-blown translations on its own. At 
the very least, one would need to use it in 
tandem with a language model p(f) capable of 
capturing some constraints on acceptable 
sequences of words in the target language. 
Notwithstanding its weaknesses Model 1 does 
capture some non trivial aspects of the 
translation relationship as we observe it across 
natural anguages. For example, it is indeed a 
property of that model that a relatively 
unambiguous source language word (say, the 
English "chimney") will reinforce its 
equivalents in a stronger way than a very 
ambiguous word. An ambiguous word like 
"drug" will reinforce each of its equivalents 
("mrdicament" and "drogue") according to a 
translation probability estimated from the 
training corpus. While the model only 
operates at the level of simple word (as 
opposed to complex terms), it should be 
observed that it nonetheless captures some 
non-trivial contextual effects. For example, if  
the training corpus contains many occurrences 
of the expression "drug traffic" translated as 
"trafic de drogue", the presence of the English 
word "traffic" will thereafter tend to reinforce 
the French word "drogue" (in this instance, 
more than the French word "mrdicament"). 
And given the fact that the intended 
application is not MT but CLIR, the use of a 
"weak" translation model turns out to be, in 
some respects, sufficient. In our IR system 
queries and documents are reperesented as 
vectors of weighted terms. Given any query e, 
our translation model will calculate a value 
for p(t~le), the probability of observing wordfj 
in the translation of e. It turns out to be 
straightforward to reinterpret this probability 
distribution as a vector of weighted terms.- 
3. Cross -Language information 
retr ieval  
After a brief description of the principal 
functions of an IR system, we report our 
experiments on CLIR. 
3.1. The  tasks of  an IR  system 
An IR system performs three main tasks \[9\] : 
? document indexing 
? query indexing 
? matching the query and the documents 
Document indexing creates an internal 
representation (for example, a vector) for each 
document. Before indexing can be 
accomplished. We proceed the following pre- 
processing: 
Morphological analysis: each word is 
transformed into a canonical, citation form. 
For example, nouns and (French) adjectives 
are transformed into their masculine singular 
form, and verbs are transformed into their 
infinitive forms. This neutralization of 
irrelevant differences in form often reduces 
retrieval silence. 
- Elimination of grammatical words: words 
that are more or less semantically empty are 
useless for IR. Such words are eliminated in 
order to reduce the size of the index and speed 
up the search process. 
For the indexing process, each document is 
represented as a set or a vector of weighted 
terms (words in canonical form). Term weight 
is determined by the following two factors: 
? ( ( te rm frequency): the relative frequency of 
the term in the document; and 
? idf(inverse document frequency): a measure 
of the non uniformity of the distribution of 
term across documents of the collection. 
The terms that rank best within a document d 
are those that are at the same time frequent 
within d and distributed unevenly in the 
collection of documents. The tt'*idf weigthing 
schema combines these two criteria \[3, 9\]. To 
determine the weight wt, of term t i in 
document d we used the following variant of 
0 idf. 
wt= \[log(f(ti, d)) + 1\] * log (N/n) 
where f(ti, d) is the frequency of term t i in 
document d, N is the total number of 
documents in the collection, and n is the 
number of documents including ti. 
The indexing process maps each document 
and query onto a vector of weights within the 
vector space of the indexes of the corpus. For 
example, 
Vector space: 
d---~ 
q--~ 
<t 1, t 2, ..., tn> 
<Wd,, we,..., we> 
<Wq , Wq2, ..., Wq > 
21 
where Wd, and Wq, are the weights of t i in 
document d and query q. 
The indexing process for queries is the same: 
Query matching involves measuring the 
degree of similarity sim(d, q) between the 
query vector q and each document vector d. In 
our case, sim(d, q) is calculated as follows: 
~i=l,n(Wd, * Wq) 
sim(d, q)= 
\[~i=l,n(W d ' 2) ,  ~i=l,n(Wq2)\] 112 
The IR system then produces a list of 
documents sorted by order of similarity with 
the query. 
3.2. Exper iments  
Our experiments are conducted on a French 
corpus used in TREC-6 (Text Retrieval 
Conference) \[8\]. The corpus contains a 
collection of articles from a Swiss newspaper 
- SDA (Schweizerische Depeschen Agentur) - 
French edition, published between 1988 and 
1990. There are 141,656 documents, for a 
total size of 87 megabytes. TREC-6 data 
includes 25 queries, each written in English, 
French and German versions. Manual 
evaluations for 22 of these have been made 
available by NIST (National Institute of 
Standards and Technology). Our evaluations 
are based on this data: the French documents 
and the French and English queries. 
We compared five different approaches: 
1. Monolingual French query-French 
documents IR. This is not CLIR, but is used as 
a reference point with which CLIR 
performance is compared. 
In the other approaches, the English query is 
translated into a French query using various 
tools. The translated queries are then used to 
retrieve French documents in the same way as 
in monolingual IR. We tested the following 
translation approaches : 
2. Using MT systems (two of them: LOGOS 
and SYSTRAN) ; 
3. Using a bilingual dictionary only; 
4. Using a probabilistic translation model; 
5. Combining 3 and 4. 
Each approach is now described in detail. 
Monolingual IR 
The classical vector space model described in 
Section 3.1 is used. System performance is
assessed by a standard IR method: average 
precision over 11 points of recall. We use the 
term IR effectiveness to refer to this particular 
measure. 
In this monolingual task, our average 
precision for the 22 queries was 37.31%. At 
the TREC-6 conference, only 13 of the 25 
queries had been evaluated manually by 
NIST. The best performance for monolingual 
IR was 45.68% for the 13 queries. For the 
same set of queries, we obtain a performance 
of 42.93%, slightly below that of the best 
system. 
CLIR using MT 
Two MT systems - LOGOS and SYSTRAN 
were used. The first three test queries are 
reproduced here: 
English queries : 
? Reasons  for cont roversy  sur round ing  
Waldhe im's  Wor ld  War  II ac t ions .  
? Are  marr iages  increas ing  wor ldwide?  
? What  measures  are  be ing  taken  to 
s tem in ternat iona l  d rug  t ra f f i c?  
LOGOS translations: 
? . Ra isons  pour  les ac t ions  de deux i~me 
guer re  mond ia le  d' entourer  de 
cont roverse  ?Waldhe im'  s. 
? Les mar iages  augmentent - i l s  dans  le 
monde ent ie r  ? 
? Que l les  mesures  sOnt  pr i ses  pour  
conten i r  la c i rcu la t ion  de 
m4dicament  in ternat iona le  ? 
SYSTRAN translations: 
? Ra isons  pour  la po l~mique  entourant  
des ac t ions  de  la deux i~me guer re  
mond ia le  de Waldhe im.  
? Sont des mar iages  augmentant  dans  le 
monde ent ie r  ? 
? Que l les  mesures  sont  p r i ses  au  
t raf ic  de s tup4f iants  in ternat iona l  
de t ige  ? 
LOGOS flags the words missing from its 
dictionary with a question mark. In the case of 
the first query, the missing word Waldheira 
will still be considered during indexing 
because there are French documents that 
happen to contain it (fortunately, proper 
names tend to be preserved intact in 
translations). In other cases, words that the 
MT system did not know will end up being 
ignored at indexing. For example, one of our 
queries contained the rare word "reusage" 
which none of our MT systems knew. 
As stated earlier, the (sometimes 
questionable) quality of translations with 
respect o syntactic structure has little effect 
on IR effectiveness. What is important is the 
choice of correct arget language quivalents. 
22 
Both LOGOS and SYSTRAN produced 
several instances of inappropriate choice. For 
example, one of our queries contained "drug 
traffic"; while SYSTRAN correctly translated 
this term as "trafic de drogue", LOGOS 
incorrectly translated it as "circulation de 
mrdicament". The same query contained the 
word stem used as a verb and SYSTRAN 
mistranslated it as the noun "tige" ("tree 
stem"). Such errors lead to retrieving 
irrelevant documents. 
Because MT systems choose a unique 
equivalent for each source language term, the 
resulting query sometimes misses documents 
containing different but related words. For 
example, the meaning of "drug" in the sense 
of Query 3 may be expressed as "drogue" or 
"stuprfiant" in French. By choosing to 
translate "drug" only by "drogue", documents 
describing "stuprfiant" cannot be retrieved. 
Despite these problems, the translations 
produced by LOGOS and SYSTRAN scored 
relatively high: an average precision of 
28.66% with LOGOS and 27.63% with 
SYSTRAN. These results appear very good in" 
comparison with comparable tests conducted 
in TREC-6 \[6, 7\]: typically, the average 
precision of this method was only about ? - 
2/3 as high as monolingual IR. At the TREC-6 
conference, the best CLIR system for English- 
French IR achieved at a performance of 
24.35% for the 13 evaluated queries. For the 
same queries, we obtained 31.96% and 
28.90% using LOGOS and SYSTRAN 
respectively. These performances are 
significantly better than other systems 
presented atTREC6. 
CLIR using a bilingual dictionary 
We obtained from the Ergane project a 
bilingual dictionary which contains 7898 
citation forms in English. Each English word 
is translated into one or more French words. 
For example: 
drug: remade, mrdicament, drogue, 
stup4fiant. 
increase: accro~tre, agrandir, 
amplifier, augmenter, 4tendre, 
accroissement, grossir, 
s'accro?tre, redoubler, 
accroissement. 
We tested a very simple approach: each word 
of an English query was replaced by all the 
French equivalents listed in the dictionary. 
For the first 3 queries, this resulted in the 
following word lists: 
Query #1 
cause, motif, raison. 
polrmique. 
entourer. 
?waldheim 
monde. 
guerre. 
ii 
activitY, action. 
Query #2 
mariage. 
accro~tre, agrandir, amplifier, 
augmenter, ~tendre, accroissement, 
grossir, s'acco~tre, redoubler, 
accroissement. 
?worldwide 
Query #3 
quo i .  
mesure~,mesure, faille. 
tige, queue, tronc. 
international. 
remade, mrdicament, drogue, 
stup4fiant. 
circulation, trafic. 
where ?waldheim and ?worldwide are 
unknown words. During indexing, the word 
worldwide will be ignored whereas 
waldheim will be indexed. 
From the above examples, we can observe the 
following facts: 
In some cases, our dictionary lookup only 
produces inappropriate translations. For 
example, the verb "stem" used in the third 
query is translated as a noun ( t ige ,  queue, 
t ronc)  . In many other cases, inappropriate 
translations are given along with some correct 
ones. Thus, "'drug" receives the correct 
equivalents drogue and stup4fiane, but 
also the inappropriate remade and 
m4dicaraent. On one hand, in failing to 
choose between distinct meanings of a source 
language word (drogue ~ m4dicaraent) the 
dictionary method will produce additional 
retrieval noise; on the other hand, in refraining 
from arbitrarily selecting between target 
language synonyms (drogue 
stup4fiant) the method performs a natural 
query expansion which will reduce retrieval 
silence. 
We also observe that the dictionary is not well 
distributed in the sense that less important 
words (from the IR point of view) may have 
more translations than more important ones. 
For example, in query 2, the word "marriage" 
23 
has only one translation, whereas the word 
"increase" has 10 translations. As a 
consequence, documents containing a word 
meaning "increase" will have a higher chance 
to be retrieved than a document about 
"marriage". Bilingual dictionaries do not seem 
to reflect the notion of importance that is 
relevant for IR. 
Our test queries contained few words that 
were missing from our dictionary, despite its 
limited size. No doubt, this is because the 
queries were mostly about general topics. 
Our dictionary-translated queries scored an 
average precision of 18.33%, that is, about 
50% of our monolingual score. 
A variant of this approach consists in using a 
bilingual terminology database instead of a 
bilingual dictionary. In contrast with 
dictionaries, terminology databases tend to 
contain a lot of complex terms. Moreover, the 
terms are usually classified into domains. 
Consequently, one would expect erminology 
databases toprovide a better basis on which to 
choose accurate indices for IR queries. 
We tested this approach using the "Banque de 
Terminologie du Qurbec" (Terminology 
database of Quebec - BTQ). This database 
contains over 500 000 terms in English and 
French, classified into about 160 domains. 
Most terms are highly specialized. Thus, the 
database is very rich in domain-specific 
information. On the other hand, words and 
expressions of everyday language are often 
missing. For example, in Query 1 "Reasons 
for controversy surrounding Waldheim's 
World War II actions", only the following 
words are found in BTQ: sur round,  i f ,  
ac t ion .  In addition, matched words are 
assigned very idiosyncratic meanings in 
different specialized omains. In Query 2 "are 
marriages increasing worldwide ?", none of 
the words is found. Replacing the original 
query with BTQ matches does not result in 
anything close to a reasonable translation. As 
a result, our average precision was only about 
8%, a performance well below our dictionary 
approach. We conclude that a highly 
specialized terminology database such as BTQ 
is not appropriate for general CLIR. 
CLIR using a probabilistic translation 
model 
Query translation is performed as follows. An 
English query e is submitted to the 
probabilistic model as a single sentence so as 
to calculate p0~le), the probability that word fj 
will occur in any translation f of e. Since fj 
ranges over a very large vocabulary (all the 
French words observed in our training 
corpus), we want to retain only the best 
scoring words. This is because: 
1) The longer the word list, the longer the 
time for the retrieval process. So a restriction 
in length leads to an increase in retrieval 
speed. 
2) As the translation model is not perfect, the 
list is sometimes noisy. This is especially true 
when the source language query contains 
words whose frequency was low in our 
training corpus: probability estimations are 
then notoriously unreliable. By limiting the 
resulting list to an appropriate length, the 
amount of noise may be reduced. 
Thus, our "translation" of a query e will be 
simply made up of the n words f~ for which 
p(~le) is highest. We will experiment with 
several values of n in order to assess how this 
parameter affects IR effectiveness. 
The following lists show the first 20 words in 
the translations of the first 3 queries of our 
test corpus and their probabilities. 
Query #1 
.=0.117685 
affaire=O.069960

Punctuation symbols are treated as ordinary 
words because we did not remove them from 
consideration i our training. This has little 
impact because they are ignored during query 
indexing. We plan to remove them altogether 
in our future experiments. 
Some interesting facts may be observed in 
these lists: 
I) The word translations obtained reflect the 
pecularities of our training corpus. For 
example, the word "drug" is translated by, 
among others, "m4dicament" et "drogue", and 
a higher probability is attributed to 
"mrdicament". This is because in the Hansard 
corpus, the English "drug" refers more often 
to the sense "m~dicament'" than to "drogue". 
2) This dependence on the training corpus 
sometimes leads to odd translations. For 
example, the word "bille" is considered as a 
French translation of "logging" in the English 
query "effects of logging on desertification". 
This translation comes from the fact that in 
the Hansard corpus "log" in English is often 
translated as "bille de bois" in French. 
3) Some words are rare or even absent in our 
training corpus, and this leads to unreliable 
translations. For example, there was only one 
occurrence of "acupuncture" in the training 
corpus. Because of that, the model fails to 
assign a higher probability to the French 
"acuponcture" than to other semantically 
unrelated words that appeared in the same 
sentence. 
4) The model sometimes fail to distinguish the 
real translation from noise induced by simple 
statistical associations. For example, the word 
"prendre" appears in the translations of 
queries 1 and 3. It is attributed with even 
higher probabilities than the true translation 
words of the query such as "second", "action" 
and "stup4fiant". Statistics alone may prove 
insufficient for tackling this problem 
correctly. 
Despite these problems, we observe that real 
translations and associated words tend to 
score relatively high and appear at the top of 
the list. When the probabilities are 
incorporated into the query vector used to 
retrieve documents, the documents containing 
these words will be retrieved in priority. 
What use should we make of the probabilities 
that our translation model associates to each 
word? Should we use them directly as the 
weights appearing in our query vector? 
Should we rather combine them with other 
information? 
Notice that the probabilities assigned by the 
translation model are related to the tf (term 
frequency) criterion of IR: our definition of 
p(~ le) is such that each individual occurrence 
of a word e~ in the query e will reinforce the 
f~'s that are likely translations for e,. 
However, our translation model has little to 
say about the other criterion that is so 
important in IR: idf (inverse document 
frequency). One possible way to derive a 
o~idf-like weighting is to use the following 
transformed weight in the query vector: 
wq = p(~l e) * log(N/n) 
where p(fjl e)is the probability obtained by the 
probabilistic translation model, and log(N/n) 
represents the idf criterion as described in 
section 3.1, 
In our experiments, we tested ifferent lengths 
of the list of translation words, as well as the 
two weighting methods in query vectors. The 
following table shows the IR effectiveness 
obtained in different cases.

24,33% 26,64% 
24,38% 26,71% 
22,51% 25,06% 
We observe that when the length of the 
translation word list increases from 10 to 50, 
the retrieval effectiveness increases lightly. 
However, when the length becomes too high 
(100), the effectiveness declines. This 
phenomenon may be explained as follows: the 
more words we retain in the translation: 1) the 
more related words get to be included; but 2) 
the more unrelated words get to be included as 
well. A good compromise is needed. 
Comparing lists of length 100 with shorten 
ones confirms our intuition that ignoring 
words with low probabilities reduces the risk 
of incorrect word associations, thus the risk of 
retrieving irrelevant documents. 
It is also evident that the transformed 
weighting which takes into account he idfo 
crtedon produces better results than 
translation probabilities alone. This is just 
another confirmation of the importance of the 
idf-cntedon i IR. 
To compare with the systems participating in 
the TREC-6 trial, we evaluated our system 
using transformed weight, at the lengths of 20 
and 50. We obtain 29.71% and 29.97% in 
performance r spectively. 
We mentioned above that our probabilistic 
translation model is sometimes unable to 
distinguish true translations from accidental 
statistical associations. We thought it might 
help to incorporate additional evidence of a 
true translation relationship if any such 
evidence was available. It is often the case in 
IR that combining different sources of 
evidence increases IR effectiveness. This is 
why we tried combining our probabilistic 
translation model with the bilingual dictionary 
mentioned above. 
Combining the probabilistic translation 
model with a bilingual dictionary 
A problem arises in such a combination due to 
the different nature of each element: one is 
weighted and the other is not. In other words, 
the question is the following: if a French word 
is a translation of an English word in the 
bilingual dictionary, how much should we 
increase the weight (probability) of this 
translation in the probabilistic model ? Our 
goal was not to provide a theoretically well 
founded answer to that question but simply to 
see if a simple-minded solution would prove 
useful in practic e. We tested the following 
approach: when a French translation is stored 
in the bilingual dictionary, its probability is 
increased by a default value, a constant 
determined manually. The new "probability" 
is used to obtain the transformed weight for 
the query vector as before. We tested several 
default values, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05. 
The following table shows the IR 
effectiveness obtained in each case.

First and foremost, note that in all cases the 
combined resources yield better retrieval 
effectiveness than either the probabilistic 
model alone or the bilingual dictionary alone. 
This strongly confirms our intuition that 
combining two sources of information should 
produce better esults. 
In many of the tested cases the combined 
approach outperform the MT systems. In the 
case where the default value is 0,02, and 50 
translation words are retained, we obtained 
the best effectiveness 29,85% (among all the 
tested cases). It may be claimed here that 
there are better tools for CLIR than MT 
systems. For the 13 queries used in the TREC- 
6 tests, we obtain 34.26% and 30.49% for the 
cases where the default value is set at 0.02, 
and the lengths at 20 and 50. These 
performances are excellent in comparing with 
the best systems at the TREC-6 conference 
(24.35%). 
Although the improvements in effectiveness 
of the combined approach over MT systems 
obtained so far are still small, we think that 
26 
this approach may be further improved by 1) 
using a better training corpus; 2) using a more 
complete bilingual dictionary; and 3) a better 
method of combination. It is also possible to 
combine our probabilistic translation model 
with an MT system. As these two methods are 
based on different knowledge sources, the 
results could well prove superior too. We plan 
to examine this combination i the future. 
4. Conclusions 
MT systems are considered by many as 
appropriate tools for CLIR. In this paper, we 
showed that there are better tools for CLIR 
than MT. We investigated the possibility of 
using a probabilistic translation model built 
automatically from a parallel corpus. In 
comparison with MT, this approach is more 
flexible. It may be used for any pair of 
languages for which an appropriate parallel 
corpus is available. 
When applied to CLIR, MT systems (LOGOS 
and SYSTRAN) can give a relatively good 
performance. Simpler approaches based only 
on bilingual dictionaries or terminology 
databases like BTQ lead to much poorer 
performance. Our probabilistic translation 
model almost rivals the performance of the 
MT systems, despite the fact that our training 
corpus is not closely related to the test corpus. 
In our experiments, we observed different 
advantages and disadvantages for different 
approaches to translate queries from a 
language to another. They often have 
complementary properties, and may be 
successfully combined. In this study, we 
combined our probabilistic translation model 
with a bilingual dictionary. This combination 
outperformed the MT systems, leading us to 
the conclusion that there are better approaches 
to CLIR than MT. 
In all cases, the performance of CLIR 
remains substantially lower than that of 
monolingual IR. Thus there is still a lot of 
room for further improvement. There may not 
be any single translation method that will fill 
the bill. We believe that progress is likely to 
come from combining various sources of 
translation knowledge and we intend to 
continue testing such methods in our future 
research.
