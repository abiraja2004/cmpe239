Abstract
Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific pa-
pers and articles is a new and interesting prob-
lem which can open up many exciting new ap-
plications in bibliographic search and biblio-
metrics. Current work on citation sentiment
detection focuses on only the citation sen-
tence. In this paper, we address the problem
of context-enhanced citation sentiment detec-
tion. We present a new citation sentiment cor-
pus which has been annotated to take the dom-
inant sentiment in the entire citation context
into account. We believe that this gold stan-
dard is closer to the truth than annotation that
looks only at the citation sentence itself. We
then explore the effect of context windows of
different lengths on the performance of a state-
of-the-art citation sentiment detection system
when using this context-enhanced gold stan-
dard definition.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific papers
and articles is a new and interesting problem. It can
open up many exciting new applications in biblio-
graphic search and in bibliometrics, i.e., the auto-
matic evaluation of the influence and impact of in-
dividuals and journals via citations. Automatic de-
tection of citation sentiment can also be used as a
first step to scientific summarisation (Abu-Jbara and
Radev, 2011). Alternatively, it can help researchers
during search, e.g., by identifying problems with a
particular approach, or by helping to recognise un-
addressed issues and possible gaps in the current re-
search.
However, there is a problem with the expression
of sentiment in scientific text. Conventionally, the
writing style in scientific writing is meant to be ob-
jective. Any personal bias by authors has to be
hedged (Hyland, 1995). Negative sentiment is po-
litically particularly dangerous (Ziman, 1968), and
some authors have documented the strategy of pref-
acing the intended criticism by slightly disingenuous
praise (MacRoberts and MacRoberts, 1984). This
makes the problem of identifying such opinions par-
ticularly challenging. This non-local expression of
sentiment has been observed in other genres as well
(Wilson et al., 2009; Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).
Figure 1: Example of anaphora in citations
A typical case is illustrated in Figure 1. While the
first sentence praises some aspects of the cited pa-
per, the remaining sentences list its shortcomings. It
is clear that criticism is the intended sentiment, but
597
if we define our gold standard only by looking at
the citation sentence, we lose a significant amount
of sentiment hidden in the text. Given that most ci-
tations are neutral (Spiegel-Rosing, 1977; Teufel et
al., 2006), this makes it ever more important to re-
cover what explicit sentiment there is from the con-
text of the citation.
However, the dominant assumption in current ci-
tation identification methods (Ritchie et al., 2008;
Radev et al., 2009) is that the sentiment present in
the citation sentence represents the true sentiment
of the author towards the cited paper. This is due
to the difficulty of determining the relevant context,
whereas it is substantially easier to identify the cita-
tion sentence. In our example above, however, such
an approach would lead to the wrong prediction of
praise or neutral sentiment.
In this paper, we address the problem of context-
enhanced citation sentiment detection. We present
a new citation sentiment corpus where each citation
has been annotated according to the dominant sen-
timent in the corresponding citation context. We
claim that this corpus is closer to the truth than an-
notation that considers only the citation sentence it-
self. We show that it increases citation sentiment
coverage, particularly for negative sentiment. Using
this gold standard, we explore the effect of assum-
ing context windows of different but fixed lengths
on the performance of a state-of-the-art citation sen-
timent detection system where the sentiment of ci-
tation is considered in the entire context of the ci-
tation and more than one single sentiment can be
assigned. Previous approaches neither detect cita-
tion sentiment and context simultaneously nor use
as large a corpus as we do.
2 Corpus Construction
We chose the dataset used by Athar (2011) compris-
ing 310 papers taken from the ACL Anthology (Bird
et al., 2008). The citation summary data from the
ACL Anthology Network1 (Radev et al., 2009) was
used. This dataset is rather large (8736 citations) and
since manual annotation of context for each citation
is a time consuming task, a subset of 20 papers were
selected corresponding to approximately 20% of the
original dataset.

We selected a four-class scheme for annotation.
Every sentence that is in a window of 4 sentences
of the citation and does not contain any direct or in-
direct mention of the citation was labelled as being
excluded (x). The window length was motivated by
recent research (Qazvinian and Radev, 2010) which
shows the best score for a four-sentence boundary
when detecting non-explicit citation. The rest of the
sentences were marked either positive (p), negative
(n) or objective/neutral (o).
A total of 1,741 citations were annotated. Al-
though this annotation was performed by the first
author only, we know from previous work that simi-
lar styles of annotation can achieve acceptable inter-
annotator agreement (Teufel et al., 2006). An exam-
ple annotation for Smadja (1993) is given in Figure
2, where the first column shows the line number and
the second one shows the class label.

To compare our work with Athar (2011), we also
applied a three-class annotation scheme. In this
method of annotation, we merge the citation context
into a single sentence. Since the context introduces
more than one sentiment per citation, we marked the
citation sentiment with the last sentiment mentioned
in the context window as this is pragmatically most
likely to be the real intention (MacRoberts and Mac-
Roberts, 1984).
As is evident from Table 1, including the 4 sen-
tence window around the citation more than dou-
bles the instances of subjective sentiment, and in the
case of negative sentiment, this proportion rises to 3.
In light of the overall sparsity of detectable citation
sentiment in a paper, and of the envisaged applica-
598
tions, this is a very positive result. The reason for
this effect is most likely ?sweetened criticism? ? au-
thors? strategic behaviour of softening the effect of
criticism among their peers (Hornsey et al., 2008).

3 Experiments and Results
We represent each citation as a feature set in a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) framework and use n-grams of length 1 to 3
as well as dependency triplets as features. The de-
pendency triplets are constructed by merging the re-
lation, governor and dependent in a single string, for
instance, the relation nsubj(failed, method) is rep-
resented as nsubj failed method . This setup
has been shown to produce good results earlier as
well (Pang et al., 2002; Athar, 2011).
The first set of experiments focuses on simulta-
neous detection of sentiment and context sentences.
For this purpose, we use the four-class annotated
corpus described earlier. While the original anno-
tations were performed for a window of length 4,
we also experiment with asymmetrical windows of l
sentences preceding the citation and r sentences suc-
ceeding it. The detailed results are given in Table 2.

0 1 1280 1812 206 182 0.717 0.777
Table 2: Results for joint context and sentiment de-
tection.
Because of the skewed class distribution, we use
both the Fmacro and Fmicro scores with 10-fold
cross-validation. The baseline score, shown in bold,
is obtained with no context window and is compara-
ble to the results reported by Athar (2011). However,
we can observe that the F scores decrease as more
context is introduced. This may be attributed to the
increase in the vocabulary size of the n-grams and a
consequent reduction in the discriminating power of
the decision boundaries. These results show that the
task of jointly detecting sentiment and context is a
hard problem.
For our second set of experiments, we use the
three-class annotation scheme. We merge the text
of the sentences in the context windows as well as
their dependency triplets to obtain the features. The
results are reported in Table 3 with best results in
bold. Although these results are not better than the
context-less baseline, the reason might be data spar-
sity since existing work on citation sentiment analy-
sis uses more data (Athar, 2011).

4 Related Work
While different schemes have been proposed for
annotating citations according to their function
(Spiegel-Rosing, 1977; Nanba and Okumura, 1999;
Garzone and Mercer, 2000), the only recent work on
citation sentiment detection using a relatively large
corpus is by Athar (2011). However, this work does
not handle citation context. Piao et al. (2007) pro-
posed a system to attach sentiment information to
the citation links between biomedical papers by us-
ing existing semantic lexical resources.
A common approach for sentiment detection is to
use a labelled lexicon to score sentences (Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). However, such approaches
599
have been found to be highly topic dependent (En-
gstro?m, 2004; Gamon and Aue, 2005; Blitzer et al.,
2007).
Teufel et al. (2006) worked on a 2,829 sentence ci-
tation corpus using a 12-class classification scheme.
Although they used context in their annotation, their
focus was on determining the author?s reason for cit-
ing a given paper. This task differs from citation sen-
timent, which is in a sense a ?lower level? of analy-
sis.
For implicit citation extraction, Kaplan et al.
(2009) explore co-reference chains for citation ex-
traction using a combination of co-reference reso-
lution techniques. However, their corpus consists
of only 94 sentences of citations to 4 papers which
is likely to be too small to be representative. The
most relevant work is by Qazvinian and Radev
(2010) who extract only the non-explicit citations
for a given paper. They model each sentence as a
node in a graph and experiment with various win-
dow boundaries to create edges between neighbour-
ing nodes. However, their dataset consists of only 10
papers and their annotation scheme differs from our
four-class annotation as they do not deal with any
sentiment.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we focus on automatic detection of
citation sentiment using the citation context. We
present a new corpus and show that ignoring the cita-
tion context would result in loss of a lot of sentiment,
specially criticism towards the cited paper. We also
report the results of the state-of-the-art citation sen-
timent detection systems on this corpus when using
this context-enhanced gold standard definition.
Future work directions may include improving
the detection algorithms by filtering the context sen-
tences more intelligently. For this purpose, exist-
ing work on coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2011)
may prove to be useful. Context features may also
be used for first filtering citations which have been
mentioned only in passing, and then applying con-
text based sentiment classification to the remaining
significant citations.
