Abstract
So far, there has been little success in Natural
Language Generation in coming up with gen-
eral models of the content selection process.
Nonetheless, there has been some work on
content selection that employ Machine learn-
ing or heuristic search. On the other side, there
is a clear tendency in NLG towards the use of
resources encoded in standard Semantic Web
representation formats. For these reasons, we
believe that time has come to propose an initial
challenge on content selection from Semantic
Web data. In this paper, we briefly outline the
idea and plan for the execution of this task.
1 Motivation
So far, there has been little success in Natural Lan-
guage Generation in coming up with general mod-
els of the content selection process. Most of the
researchers in the field agree that this lack of suc-
cess is because the knowledge and context (commu-
nicative goals, user profile, discourse history, query,
etc) needed for this task depend on the application
domain. This often led in the past to template-
or graph-based combined content selection and dis-
course structuring approaches operating on idiosyn-
cratically encoded small sets of input data. Fur-
thermore, in many NLG-applications, target texts
and sometimes even empirical data are not avail-
able, which makes it difficult to employ empirical
approaches to knowledge elicitation. Nonetheless,
during the last decade, there has been a steady flow
of new work on content selection that employed Ma-
chine learning (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Duboue
and McKeown, 2003; Jordan and Walker, 2005;
Kelly et al, 2009), heuristic search (O?Donnell et
al., 2001; Demir et al, 2010; Mellish and Pan,
2008), or a combination thereof (Bouayad-Agha et
al., 2011). All of these strategies can deal with large
volumes of data.
On the other side, there is a clear tendency in NLG
towards the use of resources encoded in terms of
standard Semantic Web representation formats such
as OWL and RDF, e.g., (Wilcock and Jokinen, 2003;
Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004; Mellish and Pan, 2008;
Power and Third, 2010; Bouayad-Agha et al, 2011;
Dannells et al, 2012), to name but a few. However,
although most of these works make a good attempt
at realisation, the problem of content determination
from Semantic Web data is relatively untouched.
For these reasons, we believe that the time has
come to bring together researchers working on (or
interested in working on) content selection to par-
ticipate in a challenge for this task using standard
freely available web data as input. The availability
of open modular multi-domain multi-billion triple
data and of open ontological resources (Bizer et al,
2009) presented in a standard knowledge represen-
tation formalism make semantic web data a natural
choice for such a challenge.
As will be presented below, this initial challenge
presents a relatively simple content selection task
with no user model and a straightforward commu-
nicative goal so that people are encouraged to take
part and motivated to stay on for later challenges, in
which the task will be successively enhanced from
gained experience.
A content determination challenge would be a
chance to (i) directly compare the performance of
146
different types of content selection strategies; (ii)
contribute towards developing a standard ?off-the-
shelf? content selection module; and (iii) contribute
towards a standard interface between text planning
and linguistic generation.
To get the widest reception possible, the challenge
will be open to any approach, be it template-, rule-
or heuristic-based, or empirical. Furthermore, it will
be advertised in the Semantic Web Community to
get contributors from other horizons, see, e.g., (Dai
et al, 2010).
In what follows, we briefly outline the idea and
plan for the execution of the challenge. In Section 2,
we outline a description of the task. In Section 3,
the data and domain that will be used are presented.
Section 4 describes how this data is to be prepared
for the task, and Section 5 how it will be released to
the participants. In Section 6, we sketch the eval-
uation including the preparation of the evaluation
dataset. Section 7 gives a proposed schedule for
each of the tasks involved in organizing the chal-
lenge. Finally, in Section 8, we provide short bi-
ographies of the members of the organization team,
focusing on their experience in the proposed task.
2 Task Description
The core of the task to be addressed can be formu-
lated as follows:
Build a system which, given a set of RDF
triples containing facts about a celebrity
and a target text (for instance, a wikipedia-
style article about that person), selects
those triples that are reflected in the target
text.
The participants are also free to consider the se-
mantics defined by the data sources in their ap-
proach, rely on additional resources like ontologies
from other sources, or disregard the semantics com-
pletely.
The implemented system should output its results
in a predefined standard format that can be used for
automatic evaluation.
It could be that the RDF data does not contain ev-
erything that would ideally be included in such an
article, but that is ignored here. The task consists in
selecting content that is communicated in the target
text.
3 The data
The domain will be constituted by short biographies
of famous people. This is an interesting domain for
the challenge because Semantic Web data and corre-
sponding texts for this domain are available in large
quantities (e.g., DBPedia or Freebase for the data
and many other sources for biography texts, among
them Wikipedia).
The data will consist, for each famous person, of
a pair of RDF-triple set and associated text(s). For
each pair, the RDF data will include both informa-
tion communicated and excluded from the text. The
text may convey information not present in the RDF-
triples, but this will be kept to a minimum, always
subject to using naturally-occurring texts. All pairs
should contain enough RDF-triples and text to make
the pair interesting for the content selection task.
When choosing data for the challenge, we will
prefer semantic contents classified under consistent
ontologies over plain Linked Data with no explicit
semantics. The semantics of the RDF data (vocab-
ularies, ontologies) will be provided, preferably en-
coded in Semantic Web standards (e.g., in RDFS or
OWL).
4 Data Preparation
The task of data preparation consists in 1) data gath-
ering and preparation, which is to be carried out by
the organizers, and 2) working dataset selection and
annotation, which is to be carried out by both the
organizers and participants.
4.1 Data gathering and preparation
This preparatory stage consists in choosing the
repository sources, downloading the relevant on-
tologies (to the extent those will be provided), and
downloading and pairing the data and associated
texts (= the paired corpus).
4.2 Working Dataset selection and annotation
The participants will be asked to participate in a pre-
liminary task consisting in marking which triples are
included in the text given a subset of the paired cor-
pus (the size of the subset still has to be decided).
This task could be supported by some automatic
anchoring techniques such as used in (Duboue and
McKeown, 2003; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). The
147
objectives of the task are threefold: (1) to provide all
participants with a common set of ?correct answers?
to be exploited in their approach, (2) to familiarize
the participants with the nature of the contents, their
semantics and the texts, and (3) to provide the task
with a ceiling for the evaluation, i.e. inter-annotator
agreement.
Annotation guidelines will be needed to ensure
that all participants follow the same procedure when
annotating texts. For this purpose, an early docu-
ment will be produced detailing the procedure to-
gether with examples and descriptions of relevant
problems such as ambiguities in the annotation. The
guidelines will be improved in multiple stages of an-
notation and revision with the goal of maximizing
inter-annotator agreement.
5 Data release
The participants in the challenge will be given ac-
cess to the set of all correct answers and a large
portion of the non-marked paired corpus, as well as
their semantics (i.e., ontologies and the like). The
remaining unseen, non-marked set will be kept for
evaluation.
6 Evaluation
The evaluation consists of 1) a preparatory stage for
selecting and annotating the evaluation dataset, and
2) an evaluation stage.
6.1 Evaluation dataset selection and annotation
Once all participants have submitted their exe-
cutable to solve the task, the evaluation set will be
processed. If timing is tight, however, this could be
done whilst the participants are still working on the
task or extra effort (for instance, from the organiz-
ers) could be brought in. A subset of the data is
randomly selected and annotated with the selected
triples by the participants. This two-stage approach
to triple selection annotation is proposed in order to
avoid any bias on the evaluation data.
6.2 Evaluation
Each executable is run against the test corpus and the
selected triples evaluated against the gold triple se-
lection set. Since this is formally a relatively simple
task of selecting a subset of a given set, we will use
for evaluation standard precision, recall and F mea-
sures. In addition, other appropriate metrics will be
explored?for instance, certain metrics for extrac-
tive summarisation (which is to some extent a simi-
lar task).
The organizers will explore whether it will be fea-
sible to select and annotate some test examples from
a different corpus and have the systems evaluated on
these as a separate task.
7 Schedule
Table 1 presents the different tasks, protagonists and
the schedule involved in the organization of the chal-
lenge. The challenge proper will take place between
November 2012 and May/June 2013.
