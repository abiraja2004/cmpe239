Introduction 
A pervasive and fundamental property of 
spoken language is the nesting of quasi-periodic 
structures, ranging ti'om the vibration of the vocal 
cords to the iteration of syllables, accents, and 
higher-order prosodic objects. The long-range 
goal of the research reported here is to bring to 
bear on the study of this phenomenon the methods 
and insights of the study of dynamical systems, 
in the hope that  this will increase our 
understanding of the computation of spoken 
language. In this paper, we describe this point of 
view and illustrate the results we have obtained to 
date in a study of English vowels, within and 
across individual speakers. 
Two perspeeU'ves on speech 
Speech is a physical event: it is produced by the 
mechanical actions of the human articulators 
and propagates itself through physical media. At 
the same time, speech is the carrier of richly- 
structured linguistic information. From this 
latter point of view, speech events constitute 
tokens of a symbolic system. The fundamental 
question prompting the research reported here is: 
what makes this duality possible? 
* This research was funded in part by Research

the National Instutute on Deafness and other 
Communication Disorders. The present state of 
this research as benefitted from comments made 
by the participants of NWAVE 22 and the Forum 
on Information-Based Linguistics held at the 
University of Arizona during the spring of 1993. 
The authors wish to acknowledge the support of 
Fred Richards, who first brought the phase portrait 
to our attention and who wrote the reconstruction 
and Poincar6 section code, and John Coleman, 
Kerry Green, and two anonymous reviewers for 
their helpful suggeslSons. 
Pretheoretically, an adequate answer to this 
question should address the interaction in spoken 
language of variation and stability. Speech is 
symbolically stable across an impressive range 
of variation of the  physical signal, variation 
observable within a given speaker, across 
speakers with a common language, and across 
the range of dialects and languages. In spite of the 
scope and pervasiveness of this variation, speech 
is not entirely arbitrary. For example, the 
phonological daptation of speech is not arbitrary: 
vowel spaces do not cross-cut each other in 
random fashion. This suggests that the symbolic 
properties of speech are not the result of a purely 
conventionalist association between the space of 
speech sounds and the i r  phonological  
interpretation. A deeper analysis can be found in 
the work of Stevens (1972) and Liljencrants & 
Lindblom (1972). Stevens notes that the vocal tract 
is constructed in such a way that there are regions 
of articulatory variation which produce relatively 
little acoustic variation. Working from the 
perspective of human action theory, Tuller & 
Kelso (1991) interpreted Stevens' notion as 
implying the existence of regions of dynamical 
stability in the speech production mechanism, 
and not as implying the existence of invariant 
acoustic propert ies wi th in  the signal.  
Liljencrants & Lindblom explore the hypothesis 
that phonological systems are solutions to the 
problems presented by ease of articulation, on the 
one hand, and ease of perception, on the other. 
Our approach to the problem focuses on how the 
intrinsic physical properties of speech are 
adaptable to the demands of symbolic 
phonological representation. To explore this 
question, we base our research on the concepts and 
methods of dynamical systems (Abraham & 
Shaw, 1992). Our work invest igates the 
trajectories of vowels in a so-called 'phase space 
representation' of the associated acoustic wave- 
71 
tbrm regarded as a function A mapping time t to 
amplitude A(t). This reconstruction transforms a
point A(t O) in the wave form to an ordered triple in 
the phase space of the form <A(t0) , A'(t0) , A"(t0)> 
where the y- and z-coordinates correspond to the 
first and second time derivative; temporally 
successive values of the function A(t)  become 
successive points in the phase space. Thus time is 
'parameterized' in the sense that it is not directly 
represented in the space, although it can always be 
recovered by considering only the behavior of the 
x-axis, which mirrors the original function A(t). 
The resulting trajectory is a closed (or nearly 
closed) curve in three dimensions which repeats 
(or nearly repeats) itself with each glottal cycle. 
Pitch is also indirectly represented, encoded 
within the representation as the distance along the 
trajectory between successive samples of the 
speech wave (at fixed temporal intervals): higher 
pitches correspond to more distant successive 
measurements. In other words, the phase-space 
reconstruction i cludes all the information found 
in spectrographic representations of speech, but 
normalizes across fundamenta l  frequency 
variation. An example follows. Consider below a 
fragment of the waveform produced during one 
male talker's production of the vowel \[u\] in the 
context of the word who'd. 
The wave form can be characterized qualitatively 
as having two large peaks, one smaller than the 
other, which repeat with each period. The phase 
portrait reconstructed from this wave form 
appears below in the form of a stereogram (join 
the two center dots by crossing your eyes to see the 
three-dimensionality of the resulting image): 
. f '  
~: {, ? 
? i ". .),

.'2.:.:.:.:...... ,~ ,~? . . , . " "?  : ' 
t 
~:'2,2.:.:.:,.  .., 
.:.ii::: 
_ : .  . 
If. 
In the reconstruction, the largest peak of the wave 
form constitutes the largest loop, and the smaller 
peak corresponds to the smaller loop. The 
trajectory winds twice around the center in the xy 
plane and twice around the the center in the xz 
plane. We provide an interpretation of these 
windings below. 
What makes this point of view attractive is, 
first of all, its physical realism: speech events in 
fact constitute a dynamical system, and as such, 
the dynamics of the art iculators and the 
acoustical dynamics they produce in the ambient 
media around them are directly characterizable 
as dynamic systems. Equally attractive is that the 
study of dynamical systems brings together, in a 
single integrated framework, quantitative and 
qualitative methods, a feature which has been 
exploited in the study of physical systems ince 
the pioneering insights of Poincar~. That is, we 
can study the dynamic aspects of speech to any 
desired degree of quantitative detail, in the same 
space that accommodates a non-quantitative, 
qual i tat ive invest igat ion of behavior. In 
particular, then, one may identify the phonetic 
properties of a speech event with the quantitative 
aspects of its behavior, and ask whether or to what 
extent the qualitative aspects of this dynamic 
system support phonological analysis. If these 
qualitative physical aspects of speech do in fact 
support phonological analys is ,  then the 
simultaneous co-existence of 'phonetic' and 
'phonological' properties in the same space 
provides an interesting alternative to the view 
that phonological properties are modeled in a 
discrete space of 'distinctive features'  and 
phonetic realization corresponds to a map from 
this discrete space to a corresponding space of 
continuous phonetic parameters. Thinking of 
phonological properties as the natural qualitative 
distinctions that exist in the continuous phase 
spaces of particular speech events makes it 
'f2 
possible to reconcile the apparent abstractness of
phonological properties with their intrinsic 
dependence on such physical parameters as 
duration, amplitude, and frequency. 
Phase space reconstruetiorm of vowels 
As we have said, the phase-space 
reconstruction makes it possible to study 
quantitative and qualitative aspects of vowels (in 
particular, and the full range of speech sounds, in 
general) in the same space. The qualitative 
aspects of dynamic behavior correspond to 
fundamental properties of attractors within the 
phase-space. The presence of such attractors is 
revealed by stability in the phase-space trajectory. 
A continuous phase space can support discretely- 
structured forms of stable behavior. Thus, one 
and the same trajectory may be studied from the 
point of view of the continuous pace or from the 
point of view of the discrete parameters which 
control the shape of that trajectory. It is this basic 
duality which we seek to exploit. 
An attractor epresents a natural limit of a 
phase-portrait.  For example, consider the 
behavior of a damped pendulum which swings 
through a series of decreasing arcs until  it 
eventual ly comes to rest. A phase-space 
reconstruction f its behavior consists of the set of 
points (x, y) in the Plane, where the x-coordinate 
represents the displacement---posit ive or
negative---of the pendulum at any given point in 
time, and the y-coordinate represents its velocity. 
Since the pendulum swings with decreasing 
displacement and correspondingly decreasing 
velocity, its phase-portrait consists of an arc 
spiraling through the phase space and ending in 
the origin---a point attractor. ~ ~xlc3t 
Other kinds of attractors are possible. The 
attractor for a bowed string, for example, is 
periodic: a closed curve in the planar phase space. 
A fundamental question in investigating speech 
as a dynamic system is the character of the 
attractors in the phase space. 
The double-Helmholz resonator model of 
the vocal tract provides a convenient and 
straightforward means to introduce the geometry 
of the vowel trajectory in phase space, the torus. 
The torus is the product S 1 ? S 1 of two circles. 
Thus, the two dimensions model the oscillatory 
properties of the two chambers, while the trajectory 
in the product of the dimensions models their 
coupling for a given value of their controlling 
parameters (that is, by hypothesis, for the phonetic 
value of a particular vowel) 1. Consider the double 
resonant cavity schematized below: 
Here, the two chambers A and B are coupled to 
each other by a connecting tube. For the moment, 
let us imagine that there is no coupling between 
the two chambers. Let chamber A have a single 
resonant frequency ?o and chamber B have a 
different resonant frequency Q. We can then 
reconstruct the phase space trajectory as a circle 
in a plane whose points are determined by the 
ordered triple 
1 Because the trajectory is derived from the actual 
acoustic waveform, our interpretation of such a 
trajectory is not in ~ principle restricted by 
limitations due to the simplicity of the double- 
resonator model. By changing the parameters of 
reconstruction we can easily embed the resulting 
trajectories in a state space of arbitrarily higher 
dimension. That is, we can relate the trajectory 
not to a line on the surface of a torus but rather to a 
rope on that surface, or we can think of this rope as 
inhabiting the space enclosed by the toms, rather 
than constraining it to occupy the surface of that 
torus. Such extensions are straightforward; 
whether they would be required in a more 
adequate model remains an open question at this 
time. 
73 
<sin z, cos z, -s in T>; z = cot. Similarly, we can 
reconstruct the phase-space trajectory for B as a 
circle in a plane whose points are determined by 
<sin T, cos T, -sin T>; T = ~2t. Because the 
resonant frequencies co and f~ are disparate, we 
can consider the two planar phase spaces to be 
orthogonal to each other, as below: 
A 
If we now t rans late  the two phase space 
trajectories and adjust the scale appropriately, it 
is easy to visualize that the space traced out by a 
point simultaneously constrained to move along 
the curve described by A and the curve described 
by B will be the surface of a torus. 
An example of such a trajectory is shown below.

The fundamental hypothesis of this paper 
is that  while the vowel space is acoustically 
continuous, the shape of the trajectories within the 
phase space representat ion corresponding to 
vowels of different quality are topologically 
dist inguishable,  and that  the tra jector ies 
corresponding to vowels of the same quality 
across talkers are homeomorphic- - - that  is,
topologica l ly  ind is t ingu ishab le .  We are 
particularly interested in trajectories which are 
periodic with respect o both dimensions of the 
torus and their coupling. Topologically, these 
trajectories are torus knots of type (re,n), where Ill 
and n are relatively prime and m represents the 
period of the trajectory with regard to one of the 
circular dimensions of the torus and n represents 
the period of the trajectory with regard to the other 
circular dimension (see Crowell & Fox, 1993). 
These two parameters  may be coupled in 
distinguishable ways as well. Even with m and n 
quite small, this space of possibilities gives rise to 
complex varieties of behavior which can be 
dist inguished on simple, discrete grounds. 
Considering speech within the phase space 
representation, then, might provide insight into 
the continuous/symbolic duality which exists in 
both the production and perception of natural 
language. 
Data 
We have collected the vowels \[i I E ae ^  u U o al 
within the context h id  from four adult males, four 
adult females, and two children (a boy, 11, and a 
girl, 9) during separate recording sessions, and 
stored the productions on a digital audio tape 
sampling at 44 kHz with 16 bits quantization. We 
then resampled these tokens onto a PC using a 
separate AID converter at 22kHz with 8 bits 
quantization. In order to study the dynamics of 
these vowels both within the glottal cycle as well 
as within the syllable, we extracted pitch-periods 
(one iteration of the closed curve in the phase 
space) from three regions of the syllable: the first 
quarter, the middle, and the third quarter. Each of 
the resulting arrays was transformed into the 
phase space using the method escribed in Gibson 
et al (1992). At the time of writing, we present 
results obtained from analyzing one adult male 
(D.B.) and two adult female talkers. 
For reference to other kinds of speech 
analys is ,  the table below compiles the 
fundamenta l  f requency  and fo rmant  
measurements for the three speakers we have 
i 
iilialyzed ,'is li l i inction or vowel quality, averagl;d 
liCl'llss l,hc three positions in tilt; syllabic. 
\ [ Insert  table 1 here.\] 
These measurements'  are in general accord with 
those presented in Peterson & Barney (1952), and 
suggest that  the voWels within our corpus are 
r phonetical ly unremarkable.  
The phase space trajectories of nine vowels 
from the male talker (D.B.) are given below: 
Insert  f igure 1 here. 
As our topology suggests, we discuss two 
qualitative parameters which serve to distinguish 
the phase por t ra i t s  from each other:  the 
smoothness of the trajectory, which we can take to 
lie |'elated to the wind4ng number around the 'tube' 
of the torus, and the number  of tr ips each 
trajectory makes about the origin, the 'circle' of 
the torus. Descending in height  across the 
inventory,  the t ra jector ies  of those vowels 
produced with central or posterior articulation \[u 
U o ^ a\] orbit the origin in a characterist ical ly 
smooth fash ion re la t ive  to the i r  anter io r  
counterparts \[iI E ae whose portraits how a great 
deal more local activity. We can interpret  this 
local activity as an increase in the number  of 
loops around the smaller diameter of the torus. In 
other words, the winding number m is large for 
f ront  vowels, and smal l  for back vowels. 
Comparing now across the trajectories of vowels, 
the number  of ro tat ions  around the origin 
increases as tongue height is lowered. That  is, 
high vowels such as \[i I u U\] show fewer trips 
around the origin than low vowels \[ae a\]. In terms 
of the state space, we can say that  the winding 
number for the large d iameter  of the torus n 
increases as vowel height decreases. 
Consider  now the fol lowing phase space 
reconstructions of the vowel /u/ spoken by two 
Jbmale talkers (upper two phase portraits) and two 
nmle talkers (lower two phase portraits): 
\ [ I -nsertf igure 2 here. I
With regard to the two qualitative parameters we 
d iscussed above,  cer ta in  s imi la r i t ies  are 
preserved within the vowel trajector ies across 
talkers. The winding number  of the small r ing 
(i.e. around tim 'tube') is small, as is the winding 
nil lnbl;r o1" the large r ing (i.e. llrOillid the 'circh;'). 
These qual i tat ive s imi lar i t ies  of the wind ing 
number can be made quant i tat ive by counting 
them, using a technique developed by Poincar6 
(we will consider only the winding number of the 
'circle' here). 
The Poincar6 section provides a means of 
simplifying the dynamics of a phase portrait  by 
considering not the whole path within the space, as 
we have done above, but ra ther  a plane which 
intersects the phase space such that  all of the 
tra jector ies pass through it. Cons istent  with 
common practice, we choose the plane associated 
with the phase-zero point of the (large) oscillator 
and, for a given glottal cycle, count how many 
times the trajectory passes through the plane in a 
single direction. By this method, we obtain for the 
continuous trajectory a discrete observation of its 
winding number.  For the example below, the 
Poincar6 section contains a single point, so the 
winding number would be 1.

The following table summarizes the results 
we have obtained for Poincar6 sections of phase 
space reconstruct ions of pitch periods exerpted 
from 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the way through the vowel 
portion of the syllable, (T.

As the data i l lustrate,  the winding number  
increases  wi th  a decrease in vowel height ,  
consistent with our qual itat ive observations for a 
single speaker. Because the winding number  is a 
measure of tr ips around the torus and therefore an 
in teger ,  i t  p rov ides  us w i th  a means  of 
discretizing the vowel space in a way which is not 
complete ly  a rb i t ra ry ,  but  ra ther  ref lects the 
internal  s t ructure of the trajectories through the 
s ta te  space itself .  Wi th in  th is  space,  the 
trajectories can be grouped together as members  of 
an equivalence class which itself  is a function of 
the contro l l ing  parameter  of vowel height .  
Specifically, high vowels \[i I u U\] can be thought of 
as being associated with trajector ies of winding 
number  n ~ 2, mid vowels are associated with 
trajectories of winding number  3 ~ n ~ 4, and low 
vowels are associated with trajectories of winding 
number  n ~ 5. Much of our data conform to this 
general izat ion with only a few out l ie rs .  As for 
those data which do fall outside of this grouping, it 
is important  o remember  that  the data given are 
based on a single Poincar~ section for a single 
pitch per iod of the re levant  vowel. A more 
thorough ana lys is  would undoubted ly  include 
both P-sections for the phase angles (0, ~/2, ~, 3~/2) 
as a means  of dist inguishing local behavior near 
the phase plane from the global properties of the 
trajectory, and for addit ional pitch-periods in the 
s igna l .  
We predict then, that  a change in the winding 
number  n for a vowel reconstructed as a phase 
space trajectory will correspond to a change in the 
perce ived phonet ic  category  of the  vowel;  
success ive ly  la rger  va lues  of the w ind ing  
number  n correspond to succesively lower vowel 
height categories. In the feature system of SPE, a 
change from n = 2 to n = 3 corresponds to a change 
from \[+high\] to \[-high\], a change from n = 4 to n = 5 
corresponds to a change from \[-low\] to \[+low\]. 
A reviewer has correctly pointed out to us that  
the winding number  around the large diameter  of 
the torus appears to be correlated with the number  
of harmonics between the fundamenta l  frequency 
and the f irst vowel formant  (although it remains  
to be confirmed, by extension it is most likely the 
case that  the winding number  around the 'tube' of 
the torus  is cor re la ted  wi th  the number  of 
harmonics  between the  fundamenta l  f requency 
and the second vowel formant). Because we have 
described this number  as a means for evaluat ing 
the perceived art iculatory height of the vowel, it 
seems appropr iate  to determine whether  or not 
there  is a precedent  in the l i te rature  for an 
interact ion between the fundamenta l  frequency 
and the first formant either in vowel production or 
vowel perception. The following bricf  chronology 
features the highl ights of our invest igat ion into 
this question. 
The interact ion between F 0 and F !  
Since the ear ly  1950's researchers  have 
observed an interact ion between fhndamenta l  
f requency and vowel percept ion.  Pot ter  and 
Ste inberg (1950), who measured  the vowels of 
male, female, and child speakers,  found that  an 
increase  in fundamenta l  f requency  across  
ta lkers  was correlated with an increase in the 
absolute frequency values of the formants  within 
a part icular vowel category. While they suggested 
that  fundamenta l  f requency var ia t ion  might  
of fer  a means  for normal i z ing  fo rmant  
frequency values, they decided it was "a dubious 
possibil ity" since, among other things, formants  
are a product of the physical aspects of the vocal 
t ract  and have little dependence on fundamenta l  
frequency. However, they also found an effect of a 
change in fundamenta l  f requency  on the 
percept ion of synthet ic  vowels whose fo rmant  
s t ructure  remained  constant:  as fundamenta l  
frequency was increased, the perceived frequency 
of the f irst formant  decreased. That  is, a vowel 
whose formant  structure corresponded to a male 
\[a\] was perceived as an \[a\] when synthesized with 
the fundamenta l  frequency of a male, but  as a 
(ch i ld 's)  \[O\] when synthes ized  w i th  the  
fundamenta l  f requency of a child. S imi lar ly,  a 
vowel whose formant  structure corresponded to a 
ma le  \[ae\] was perce ived as an \[ae\] when 
synthesized with the fundamenta l  frequency of a 
male, but as a (child's) vowel somewhere between 
\[ae\] and  \[El when synthes ized  wi th  the 
fundamenta l  f requency of a child. They report  
fu r ther  evidence, a lbeit  anecdotal ,  that  when 
hel ium was used as a propagat ion  medium for 
adult  male vowels or an art i f ic ial  larynx was 
used to excite the vowel formants  of a child (thus 
rais ing or lowing, respectively, the fundamenta l  
frequency of the subject while leaving the vocal 
t rac t  constant) ,  that  a speaker  will "make  
ad justments  in his formant  frequencies in order 
to ma inta in  a g iven vowel sound." S imi la r  
f indings are also to be found in Peterson (1961), 
who reports,  again anecdotal ly,  that  "if a man 
ra i ses  his fundamenta l  voice f requency  to 
correspond to that of n child (falsetto), and the 
higher tbrmants are removed by filtering, the 
acoustical result corresponds very closely to the 
\[Ol of a child with low-pass filtering and. may be 
so interpreted by a listener." More systematic 
studies of the effects of F 0 on perception of vowels 
were conducted by Miller (1953), Fujisaki & 
Kawashima (1968), and  Carlson et al (1975). 
Each of these studies reported a similar shift in 
the perceptual boundary between vowel categories 
as fundamental  frequency was changed: an 
increase in fundamental frequency leads to a 
decrease in the perceived value of the first 
\[brmant, and thus an increase in the perceived 
articulation height of the vowel. In sum, several 
studies have indlicated that  a person's 
Ihndamental fi'equency interacts with both vowel 
production and vowel perception, and that the 
product of this interaction appears to be under the 
control ot' the speaker to some degree. 
The observations reported in Scott (1976) 
provide some insight into predicting the impact on 
w)wel perception of the interaction between F0 and 
F 1. Scott explored the perceptual consequences of 
manipulat ing the temporal  f ine-structure of 
w~wel waveforms, and found that the perceptual 
boundary dividing a synthesized continuum 
whose endpoints were /i/ and /I/ was correlated 
with a change in the number of positive-going 
slopes in the wavef0rm: those stimuli with two 
positive-going slopes were categorized as/ i /whi le  
those with three positive-going slopes were 
c~ltcgorizcd as /l/. In a fi)llow-up experiment, F 0 
and F 1 were manipulated in three synthetic 
continua to produce a series with a waveform 
change from three cycles of F 1 per fundamental 
period to four cycles Of F 1 per fundamental period 
at d i f ferent points along the seven-step 
coutinuum. For those continua whose waveform 
changes occurred near the category boundary (the 
region where the tokens became ambiguous), the 
position of the boundary shifted to the stimulus 
where the waveform change occurred. This 
research suggests that, at least for ambiguous 
vowels (i.e., those :near the boundary of two 
d is t inct  phonet ic  categor ies) ,  category  
membership can be decided on the basis of the 
temporal fine-structure of the wave form. 
The Scott study bears close similarity with the 
dynamic approach discussed here. The temporal 
line-structure that Scott manipulated has a direct 
correlation to the winding number of the phase 
space trajectory. Specifically, those tokens which 
contain an extra cycle of F 1 per fundamental 
period are also those whose winding number n 
increases by 1. As Scott observed, such a change 
was detectable perceptually, and its detection 
corresponds to a change in the mapping of the 
acoustic stimulus from one phonetic category to 
another. Relating this to the table of values from 
the Poincar6 analysis, one can see that in natural 
speech, the change between/ i /and/ I / fo r  a given 
speaker is consistent with an integral increase in 
the winding number. Hence, Scott's prediction 
that temporal fine structure is correlated with the 
perceptual phonetic ategory of a synthetic vowel 
is borne out in our natural speech data as well. 
Put in phonological terms, the perceptual 
distinction between /i/ and /I/ which Scott 
investigated is typically characterized not as a 
change in vowel height, but rather as a change in 
the value of the \[tense\] or \[ATR\] feature. Because 
we have limited our analysis to distinctions of 
vowel height and net other dimensions which 
del imit the vowel space, there are clear 
differences between that study and the predictions 
we make here; we cannot comment on the extent 
of those differences at this stage in our research. 
More work will certainly be required to verify the 
connect ion  between the  parameters  
distinguishing the vowel space and those aspects 
of vowel (production) dynamics represented 
within the wave form. However, the connection 
between our approach and Scott's results (and the 
legacy of research which precedes it) is 
compel l ing.  It suggests  the otherwise  
unanticipated result that the oscillator driving 
vowel production (the glottal source which 
produces F 0) and the resonant cavity which 
determines vowel quality are entrained (coupled) 
in frequency. 
Conclusion 
In this discussion we have provided only a 
very cursory analysis of a small set of talkers, but 
it nevertheless i l lustrates the potential power 
which this theoretical perspective can have as a 
tool for resolving the continuous/discrete duality 
we mentioned above. It is important also to note 
that this technique of phase space reconstruction 
and subsequent P-section analysis can be 
obtained without any specialized hardware 
beyond that needed to discretize the wave form 
77 
itself and does not rely on the Fourier transform. 
As an analysis toolkit, then, this approach offers 
an augmentation to current spectral analysis 
techniques by reducing some of the cross-talker 
variation that such techniques cannot abstract 
away from via a 'vocal-tract internal' means of 
normalizing across differences in talkers and 
situations. 
As a final consideration along these lines, we 
point out two additional curiosities about speech 
that may also succumb to analysis under the 
dynamical perspective. First, as early as 1947 
French and Steinberg showed that speech could be 
either low-pass filtered or high-pass filtered at 1.9 
kHz while reta in ing around 68% of its 
intelligibility. This suggests that the global 
structure of the vowel's dynamics may in fact be 
retained in spite of the filtering process at this 
'magic' frequency. If this proves to be true, then 
our approach offers a unique perspective from 
which a s t ra ight forward account of this 
phenomenon can be obtained. Second, Licklider 
and Pollack (1948) showed that speech subjected to 
differentiation followed by infinite peak clipping 
(which preserves only the zero crossings of the 
wave form) was also highly intelligible--in fact, 
about 90% intelligible. Although we have not 
explored this fully, such a transformation seems 
intuit ively related to the Poincar~ section 
analysis which we have provided above.
