Abstract
We describe the system developed by the
team of the National University of Singa-
pore for English to Spanish machine trans-
lation of News Commentary text for the
WMT09 Shared Translation Task. Our
approach is based on domain adaptation,
combining a small in-domain News Com-
mentary bi-text and a large out-of-domain
one from the Europarl corpus, from which
we built and combined two separate phrase
tables. We further combined two language
models (in-domain and out-of-domain),
and we experimented with cognates, im-
proved tokenization and recasing, achiev-
ing the highest lowercased NIST score of
6.963 and the second best lowercased Bleu
score of 24.91% for training without us-
ing additional external data for English-to-
Spanish translation at the shared task.
1 Introduction
Modern Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
systems are typically trained on sentence-aligned
parallel texts (bi-texts) from a particular domain.
When tested on text from that domain, they
demonstrate state-of-the art performance, but on
out-of-domain test data the results can deteriorate
significantly. For example, on the WMT06 Shared
Translation Task, the scores for French-to-English
translation dropped from about 30 to about 20
Bleu points for nearly all systems when tested on
News Commentary instead of the Europarl1 text,
which was used for training (Koehn and Monz,
2006).
1See (Koehn, 2005) for details about the Europarl corpus.
Subsequently, in 2007 and 2008, the WMT
Shared Translation Task organizers provided a
limited amount of bilingual News Commentary
training data (1-1.3M words) in addition to the
large amount of Europarl data (30-32M words),
and set up separate evaluations on News Commen-
tary and on Europarl data, thus inviting interest in
domain adaptation experiments for the News do-
main (Callison-Burch et al, 2007; Callison-Burch
et al, 2008). This year, the evaluation is on News
Commentary only, which makes domain adapta-
tion the central focus of the Shared Translation
Task.
The team of the National University of Singa-
pore (NUS) participated in the WMT09 Shared
Translation Task with an English-to-Spanish sys-
tem.2 Our approach is based on domain adapta-
tion, combining the small in-domain News Com-
mentary bi-text (1.8M words) and the large out-
of-domain one from the Europarl corpus (40M
words), from which we built and combined two
separate phrase tables. We further used two
language models (in-domain and out-of-domain),
cognates, improved tokenization, and additional
smart recasing as a post-processing step.
2 The NUS System
Below we describe separately the standard and the
nonstandard settings of our system.
2.1 Standard Settings
In our baseline experiments, we used the follow-
ing general setup: First, we tokenized the par-

ward and/or backward between English and five other Euro-
pean languages (French, Spanish, German, Czech and Hun-
garian), but we only participated in English?Spanish, due to
time limitations.

allel bi-text, converted it to lowercase, and fil-
tered out the overly-long training sentences, which
complicate word alignments (we tried maximum
length limits of 40 and 100). We then built sep-
arate English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English
directed word alignments using IBM model 4
(Brown et al, 1993), combined them using the in-
tersect+grow heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003), and
extracted phrase-level translation pairs of maxi-
mum length 7 using the alignment template ap-
proach (Och and Ney, 2004). We thus obtained
a phrase table where each phrase translation pair
is associated with the following five standard pa-
rameters: forward and reverse phrase translation
probabilities, forward and reverse lexical transla-
tion probabilities, and phrase penalty.
We then trained a log-linear model using the
standard feature functions: language model proba-
bility, word penalty, distortion costs (we tried dis-
tance based and lexicalized reordering models),
and the parameters from the phrase table. We
set al feature weights by optimizing Bleu (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) directly using minimum error
rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) on the tuning
part of the development set (dev-test2009a).
We used these weights in a beam search decoder
(Koehn et al, 2007) to translate the test sentences
(the English part of dev-test2009b, tokenized
and lowercased). We then recased the output us-
ing a monotone model that translates from low-
ercase to uppercase Spanish, we post-cased it us-
ing a simple heuristic, de-tokenized the result, and
compared it to the gold standard (the Spanish part
of dev-test2009b) using Bleu and NIST.
2.2 Nonstandard Settings
The nonstandard features of our system can be
summarized as follows:
Two Language Models. Following Nakov
and Hearst (2007), we used two language mod-
els (LM) ? an in-domain one (trained on a con-
catenation of the provided monolingual Spanish
News Commentary data and the Spanish side of the
training News Commentary bi-text) and an out-of-
domain one (trained on the provided monolingual
Spanish Europarl data). For both LMs, we used
5-gram models with Kneser-Ney smoothing.
Merging Two Phrase Tables. Following
Nakov (2008), we trained and merged two phrase-
based SMT systems: a small in-domain one using
the News Commentary bi-text, and a large out-of-
domain one using the Europarl bi-text. As a result,
we obtained two phrase tables, Tnews and Teuro,
and two lexicalized reordering models, Rnews and
Reuro. We merged the phrase table as follows.
First, we kept all phrase pairs from Tnews. Then
we added those phrase pairs from Teuro which
were not present in Tnews. For each phrase pair
added, we retained its associated features: forward
and reverse phrase translation probabilities, for-
ward and reverse lexical translation probabilities,
and phrase penalty. We further added two new fea-
tures, Fnews and Feuro, which show the source of
each phrase. Their values are 1 and 0.5 when the
phrase was extracted from the News Commentary
bi-text, 0.5 and 1 when it was extracted from the
Europarl bi-text, and 1 and 1 when it was extracted
from both. As a result, we ended up with seven pa-
rameters for each entry in the merged phrase table.
Merging Two Lexicalized Reordering Tables.
When building the two phrase tables, we also
built two lexicalized reordering tables (Koehn et
al., 2005) for them, Rnews and Reuro, which we
merged as follows: We first kept all phrases from
Rnews, then we added those from Reuro which
were not present in Rnews. This resulting lexical-
ized reordering table was used together with the
above-described merged phrase table.
Cognates. Previous research has shown that us-
ing cognates can yield better word alignments (Al-
Onaizan et al, 1999; Kondrak et al, 2003), which
in turn often means higher-quality phrase pairs and
better SMT systems. Linguists define cognates
as words derived from a common root (Bickford
and Tuggy, 2002). Following previous researchers
in computational linguistics (Bergsma and Kon-
drak, 2007; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Melamed,
1999), however, we adopted a simplified definition
which ignores origin, defining cognates as words
in different languages that are mutual translations
and have a similar orthography. We extracted and
used such potential cognates in order to bias the
training of the IBM word alignment models. Fol-
lowing Melamed (1995), we measured the ortho-
graphic similarity using longest common subse-
quence ratio (LCSR), which is defined as follows:
LCSR(s1, s2) = |LCS(s1,s2)|max(|s1|,|s2|)
where LCS(s1, s2) is the longest common subse-
quence of s1 and s2, and |s| is the length of s.
Following Nakov et al (2007), we combined the
LCSR similarity measure with competitive linking
(Melamed, 2000) in order to extract potential cog-
76
nates from the training bi-text. Competitive link-
ing assumes that, given a source English sentence
and its Spanish translation, a source word is ei-
ther translated with a single target word or is not
translated at all. Given an English-Spanish sen-
tence pair, we calculated LCSR for all cross-lingual
word pairs (excluding stopwords and words of
length 3 or less), which induced a fully-connected
weighted bipartite graph. Then, we performed a
greedy approximation to the maximum weighted
bipartite matching in that graph (competitive link-
ing) as follows: First, we aligned the most sim-
ilar pair of unaligned words and we discarded
these words from further consideration. Then, we
aligned the next most similar pair of unaligned
words, and so forth. The process was repeated un-
til there were no words left or the maximal word
pair similarity fell below a pre-specified threshold
? (0 ? ? ? 1), which typically left some words
unaligned.3 As a result we ended up with a list C
of potential cognate pairs. Following (Al-Onaizan
et al, 1999; Kondrak et al, 2003; Nakov et al,
2007) we filtered out the duplicates in C , and we
added the remaining cognate pairs as additional
?sentence? pairs to the bi-text in order to bias the
subsequent training of the IBM word alignment
models.
Improved (De-)tokenization. The default to-
kenizer does not split on hyphenated compound
words like nation-building, well-rehearsed, self-
assured, Arab-Israeli, domestically-oriented, etc.
While linguistically correct, this can be problem-
atic for machine translation since it can cause data
sparsity issues. For example, the system might
know how to translate into Spanish both well and
rehearsed, but not well-rehearsed, and thus at
translation time it would be forced to handle it as
an unknown word, i.e., copy it to the output un-
translated. A similar problem is related to double
dashes, as illustrated by the following training sen-
tence: ?So the question now is what can China do
to freeze--and, if possible, to reverse--North Ko-
rea?s nuclear program.? We changed the tokenizer
so that it splits on ?-? and ?--?; we altered the de-
tokenizer accordingly.
Improved Recaser. The default recaser sug-
gested by the WMT09 organizers was based on a
monotone translation model. We trained such a
recaser on the Spanish side of the News Commen-
3For News Commentary, we used ? = 0.4, which was
found by optimizing on the development set; for Europarl,
we set ? = 0.58 as suggested by Kondrak et al (2003).
tary bi-text that translates from lowercase to up-
percase Spanish. While being good overall, it had
a problem with unknown words, leaving them in
lowercase. In a News Commentary text, however,
most unknown words are named entities ? persons,
organization, locations ? which are spelled with a
capitalized initial in Spanish. Therefore, we used
an additional recasing script, which runs over the
output of the default recaser and sets the casing of
the unknown words to the original casing they had
in the English input. It also makes sure all sen-
tences start with a capitalized initial.
Rule-based Post-editing. We did a quick study
of the system errors on the development set, and
we designed some heuristic post-editing rules,
e.g.,
? ? or ! without ? or ? to the left: if so, we
insert ?/? at the sentence beginning;
? numbers: we change English numbers like
1,185.32 to Spanish-style 1.185,32;
? duplicate punctuation: we remove dupli-
cate sentence end markers, quotes, commas,
parentheses, etc.
3 Experiments and Evaluation
Table 1 shows the performance of a simple
baseline system and the impact of different
cumulative modifications to that system when
tuning on dev-test2009a and testing on
dev-test2009b. The table report the Bleu and
NIST scores measured on the detokenized out-
put under three conditions: (1) without recasing
(?Lowercased?), 2) using the default recaser (?Re-
cased (default)?), and (3) using an improved re-
caser and post-editing rules Post-cased & Post-
edited?). In the following discussion, we will dis-
cuss the Bleu results under condition (3).
System 1 uses sentences of length up to 40
tokens from the News Commentary bi-text, the
default (de-)tokenizer, distance reordering, and a
3-gram language model trained on the Spanish
side of the bi-text. Its performance is quite mod-
est: 15.32% of Bleu with the default recaser, and
16.92% when the improved recaser and the post-
editing rules are used.
System 2 increases to 100 the maximum length
of the sentences in the bi-text, which yields 0.55%
absolute improvement in Bleu.
System 3 uses the new (de-)tokenizer, but this
turns out to make almost no difference.

Table 1: Impact of the combined modifications for English-to-Spanish machine translation on
dev-test2009b. We report the Bleu and NIST scores measured on the detokenized output under
three conditions: (1) without recasing (?Lowercased?), (2) using the default recaser (?Recased (default)?),
and (3) using an improved recaser and post-editing rules (?Post-cased & Post-edited?). The News Com-
mentary baseline system uses sentences of length up to 40 tokens from the News Commentary bi-text,
the default tokenizer and de-tokenizer, a distance-based reordering model, and a trigram language model
trained on the Spanish side of the bi-text. The Europarl system is the same as system 6, except that it
uses the Europarl bi-text instead of the News Commentary bi-text.
System 4 adds a lexicalized re-ordering model,
which yields 0.8% absolute improvement.
System 5 improves the language model. It adds
the additional monolingual Spanish News Com-
mentary data provided by the organizers to the
Spanish side of the bi-text, and uses a 5-gram lan-
guage model instead of the 3-gram LM used by
Systems 1-4. This yields a sizable absolute gain in
Bleu: 2.27%.
System 6 adds a second 5-gram LM trained on
the monolingual Europarl data, gaining 0.2%.
System 7 augments the training bi-text with
cognate pairs, gaining another 0.57%.
System 8 is the same as System 6, except that
it is trained on the out-of-domain Europarl bi-
text instead of the in-domain News Commentary
bi-text. Surprisingly, this turns out to work bet-
ter than the in-domain System 6 by 1.14% of
Bleu. This is a quite surprising result since in
both WMT07 and WMT08, for which compara-
ble kinds and size of training data was provided,
training on the out-of-domain Europarl was al-
ways worse than training on the in-domain News
Commentary. We are not sure why it is different
this year, but it could be due to the way the dev-
train and dev-test was created for the 2009 data ?
by extracting alternating sentences from the origi-
nal development set.
System 9 augments the Europarl bi-text with
cognate pairs, gaining another 0.21%.
System 10 merges the phrase tables of systems
7 and 9, and is otherwise the same as them. This
adds another 0.27%.
Our official submission to WMT09 is the post-
edited System 10, re-tuned on the full development
set: dev-test2009a + dev-test2009b (in
order to produce more stable results with MERT).
4 Conclusion and Future Work
As we can see in Table 1, we have achieved not
only a huge ?vertical? absolute improvement of
5.5-6% in Bleu from System 1 to System 10, but
also a significant ?horizontal? one: our recased and
post-edited result for System 10 is better than that
of the default recaser by 1.63% in Bleu (22.37%
vs. 20.74%). Still, the lowercased Bleu of 24.40%
suggests that there may be a lot of room for fur-
ther improvement in recasing ? we are still about
2% below it. While this is probably due primarily
to the system choosing a different sentence-initial
word, it certainly deserves further investigation in
future work.
