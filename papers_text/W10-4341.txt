Abstract
Dialog modeling in robotics suffers from
lack of generalizability, due to the fact
that the dialog is heavily influenced by
the tasks the robot is able to perform.
We introduce interleaving interaction pat-
terns together with a general protocol for
task communication which enables us to
systematically specify the relationship be-
tween dialog structure and task structure.
We argue that this approach meets the re-
quirements of advanced dialog modeling
on robots and at the same time exhibits a
better scalability than existing concepts.
1 Introduction
The need for interaction modeling on robots is
widely acknowledged, not only for instructing
them but also for enabling them to learn from hu-
mans within interaction. Yet, today?s robotic sys-
tems often do not have a dedicated dialog system
but employ simple command-matching techniques
(e.g. (Bo?hme et al, 2003)). Other systems rely
on finite-state based dialog managers (e.g. (Bauer
et al, 2009)) that couple dialog and task man-
agement which hampers maintainability and reuse
and does not scale well for more complex interac-
tion scenarios.
On the other hand, concepts for reusable dialog
frameworks have been established within the spo-
ken dialog community for traditional information-
seeking domains where the system first collects
the required parameters, then presents the desired
information to the user, e.g. an accommodation
or travel information (e.g. (Bohus and Rudnicky,
2009)). However, these concepts are not directly
transferable to robotics, due to the situated nature
of human-robot interaction. A robot perceives the
world and acts on it ? and it is supposed to com-
municate about that. For instance, a robot manip-

ulating objects needs to be able to verbalize its in-
tended actions and give feedback about its internal
state, but it also needs to react on feedback com-
ments or corrections uttered by the human tutor. In
order to equip a robot with such fine-grained com-
munication skills, tight integration of action exe-
cution into interaction is required. In simple terms,
while the dialog frameworks mentioned can be re-
ferred to as information-oriented, we need rather
action-oriented approaches for robotics.

2 The Pamini framework
This paper presents the Pamini (Pattern-based
mixed-initiative) human-robot interaction frame-
work. Pamini proposes a new approach for dialog
229
modeling on robots that includes (1) a task-state
protocol providing a fine-grained interface to the
complex domain processing of the robotic system
and (2) the concept of generic interaction patterns
that support rapid prototyping of human-robot in-
teractions and can be combined in a flexible way.
Previous versions of the Pamini framework
have been applied in several mixed-initiative
learning scenarios. For example, in the Home-
Tour scenario a mobile robot builds up a spatial
model of its environment and gradually improves
its model by attempting to obtain information from
the human (Peltason et al, 2009). In the Curious
Robot scenario shown in figure 1, an anthropomor-
phic robot learns to label and grasp objects, apply-
ing a proactive dialog strategy that provides guid-
ance for untrained users (Lu?tkebohle et al, 2009).
A dialog excerpt is shown in table 1.
2.1 The task state protocol
A dialog system for robotics needs to coordinate
with a number of components, e.g. for perceptual
analysis, motor control or components generating
nonverbal feedback. To realize this, we use the
concept of tasks that can be performed by com-
ponents. Tasks are described by an execution state
and a task specification containing the information
required for execution. A protocol specifies task
states relevant for coordination and possible tran-
sitions between them as shown in figure 2. Task
updates, i.e. updates of the task state and possi-
bly the task specification, cause event notifications
which are delivered to the participating compo-
nents whereupon they take an appropriate action.

Figure 2: The task life-cycle. A task gets initiated, ac-
cepted, may be cancelled or updated, may deliver intermedi-
ate results and finally is completed. Alternatively, it can be
rejected by the handling component or execution may fail.
Tight integration with action execution A
robot performing e.g. a grasp action supervised
by the human requires multi-step communication
between the dialog system and the arm control as
illustrated in figure 3. Generally, with the accepted
state, the proposed protocol enables the dialog sys-
tem to provide feedback during slow-going actions
indicating the internal system state. Further, with
the update and result available states, it supports
the modification of the task specification during
execution and thus gives the robot the ability to
react to comments, corrections and commands on-
the-fly.

Figure 3: The component communication for a grasp ac-
tion requested by the human. As the dialog manager (DLG)
receives the grasp command, it initiates a grasp task which
is accepted by the arm control. The DLG is notified about
the task state update and acknowledges task execution. As
the human commands cancelling, the DLG sets the task state
cancel. Since the arm control fails to cancel the task, it sets
the task state cancel failed which the DLG reacts on by ex-
pressing an excuse. Finally the task is completed, and the
DLG acknowledges successful task execution.
Mixed-initiative interaction The Pamini dialog
manager offers dialog tasks for other components,
e.g. greeting the human, informing the human
about anything or conversely requesting informa-
tion from the human. While human initiative is re-
alized whenever input from a speech understand-
ing component is received, robot initiative occurs
when a system component requests a dialog task to
be executed. Situation permitting, the dialog man-
ager will accept the dialog task, go into interaction
with the human, and finally complete the dialog
task. Thus, it can react to the system?s and the hu-
man?s initiative using the same task-state protocol
Learning within interaction The task state pro-
tocol supports robotic learning within interaction
by establishing mechanisms for information trans-
fer from the dialog system to the robotic sub-
system. Once information is available from the
human, Pamini augments the task specification
230
with the new information and sets the task state
result available. Since this transition may be
taken multiple times, given information can be
corrected. Also, mixed-initiative enables active
learning, where the learner provokes a situation
providing new information instead of waiting un-
til such situation eventually presents itself.
2.2 Interaction patterns
In an interaction, dialog acts are not unrelated
events, but form coherent sequences. For exam-
ple, a question is usually followed by an answer,
and a request is typically either accepted or re-
jected. Influenced by the concepts of adjacency
pairs (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973), conversation
policies (Winograd, 1986) and software design
patterns, we propose the concept of interaction
patterns that describe recurring dialog structures
on a high level. Interaction patterns can be formal-
ized as transducer augmented with internal state
actions, consisting of
? a set of human dialog acts H and a set of robot dialog
acts R, e.g. H.request or R.assert;
? a set of incoming task events T , e.g. accepted or failed;
? a set of states S representing the interaction state;
? a set of actions A the dialog manager performs, e.g.
initiating or updating a task or reset interaction;
? an input alphabet ? ? (H ? T );
? an output alphabet ? ? R;
? a transition function T : S ? ?? ?? S ?A? ? ??.
By admitting task events as input and internal
actions that perform task initiation and update,
the dialog level is linked with the domain level.
The patterns have been implemented as statecharts
(Harel, 1987), an extended form of finite state ma-
chines, which provides both an executable model
and an understandable graphical representation as
shown in figure 5. For instance, the cancellable
state nameaction, when enteredH.dialog-act / state nameH.dialog-act / R.dialog-act state nametask event / R.dialog-act //
Figure 5: Interaction patterns are represented as transducer
that takes as input human dialog acts and task events and pro-
duces robot dialog acts as output.
action request pattern shown in figure 4 describes
an action request initiated by the human that can
be cancelled during execution. The normal course
of events is that the human requests the action to
be executed, the dialog manager initiates the do-
main task, the responsible system component ac-
cepts execution so that the dialog manager will
assert execution. Finally, the task is completed
and the robot acknowledges. In contrast, the cor-
rectable information request pattern is initiated by
the human. Here, on receiving the respective di-
alog task request, the dialog manager will ask for
the desired information and accept the dialog task.
Once the human provides the answer, the robot
will repeat it as implicit confirmation that can be
corrected if necessary. Table 2 lists all patterns that
have been identified so far.

Table 2: Available interaction patterns.
Pattern configuration The patterns themselves
do not determine what kind of task is to be ex-
ecuted or what kind of information to obtain ex-
actly. These specifics are defined by the configu-
ration associated with each pattern, and a concrete
scenario is realized by configuring a set of patterns
using a domain-specific language and registering
them with the dialog manager.
In detail, it needs to be specified for the human?s
dialog acts what kind of (possibly multimodal) in-
put is interpreted as a given dialog act which is
done by formulating conditions over the input. For
the robot?s dialog acts, their surface form needs to
be specified. Up to now, speech output and point-
ing gestures are implemented as output modalities
and can be combined. Moreover, also the task
communication needs to be configured, i.e. the
task specification itself as well as possible task
specification updates. In addition, the developer
can define context variables and use them to pa-
rameterize the robot?s dialog acts and in task spec-
ification updates. This is how e.g. for the robot?s
information request the answer is transferred from
the human to the responsible system component.
Interleaving patterns during interaction Dur-
ing interaction, the registered patterns are em-
ployed in a flexible way by admitting patterns to
be interrupted by other patterns and possibly re-
sumed later which leads to interleaving patterns.
By default, simpler patterns are permitted to be
nested within temporally extended patterns. For
example, it seems reasonable to permit monitoring
questions uttered by the human to be embedded in
the robot?s slow-going grasp execution as shown

in table 1 which equips the robot with multitasking
capabilities. Interleaving is realized by organizing
active patterns on a stack. Whenever an input is
received, the dialog manager attempts to interpret
it in the context provided by the topmost pattern.
If it fails, the lower and inactive patterns are tried.
3 Discussion and Conclusion
The presented approach to dialog modeling on
robots relies on the concept of interaction patterns
that constitute configurable (and thus reusable)
building blocks of interaction. A fine-grained task
state protocol links dialog and domain level. With
interleaving patterns, flexible dialog modeling is
achieved that goes beyond current state-of-the-art
dialog modeling on robots. Further, by encapsulat-
ing both the subtleties of dialog management and
the complexity of component integration, the pro-
posed interaction patterns support rapid prototyp-
ing of human-robot interaction scenarios.
The evaluation of the approach needs to exam-
ine framework usability, framework functionality
and usability of the resulting dialogs. With respect
to framework usability, we already showed that
developers unfamiliar with the framework were
able to build a simple interaction scenario within
one hour (Peltason and Wrede, 2010). With re-
spect to framework functionality, we demonstrated
that the robot?s mixed-initiative interaction capa-
bilities enable human and robot in the Home-Tour
scenario to jointly build up a common represen-
tation of their environment and even compensate
for classification errors (Peltason et al, 2009).
As to dialog usability, a video study indicates
that the Curious Robot?s proactive dialog strat-
egy guides unexperienced users (Lu?tkebohle et al,
2009). Further, given a dialog system architecture
that supports rapid prototyping, comparative stud-
ies become possible. Therefore, we currently pre-
pare a study to compare the curiosity strategy with
a user-directed strategy that provides more free-
dom but also more uncertainty to the user. Last
but not least, we will evaluate the patterns them-
selves and pattern interleavability. Are users likely
to interrupt a robot?s action by asking questions or
even giving new commands? Also, are there other
kinds of interaction patterns that occur in a real in-
teraction but are not captured yet?
