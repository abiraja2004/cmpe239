Abstract
There are few computational models of sec-
ond language acquisition (SLA). At the same
time, many questions in the field of SLA re-
main unanswered. In particular, SLA patterns
are difficult to study due to the large amount of
variation between human learners. We present
a computational model of second language
construction learning that allows manipulating
specific parameters such as age of onset and
amount of exposure. We use the model to
study general developmental patterns of SLA
and two specific effects sometimes found in
empirical studies: construction priming and a
facilitatory effect of skewed frequencies in the
input. Our simulations replicate the expected
SLA patterns as well as the two effects. Our
model can be used in further studies of various
SLA phenomena.
1 Introduction
Computational models have been widely used for
investigating how humans learn and process their
native language. Various models of child language
acquisition have been applied to studies of speech
segmentation (e.g., ten Bosch, Hamme, & Boves,
2008), word learning (e.g., Frank, Goodman, &
Tenenbaum, 2009; Fazly, Alishahi, & Stevenson,
2010), induction of linguistic structure (e.g., El-
man, 1990), etc. In comparison, the acquisition of
second language has received little attention from
the modeling community. Most of the child lan-
guage acquisition models cannot be directly used
for investigating how humans process and acquire
foreign languages. In order to do so, we have to
model the existing knowledge of first language?
i.e., bilingualism.
Li (2013) provides a state-of-the-art overview
of models of bilingualism. One of his claims
is that most existing models account for mature
adult speaker?s knowledge and do not explain how
foreign language develops in learners. In other
words, there are several computational models of
second language processing (e.g., Shook & Mar-
ian, 2013; Roelofs, Dijkstra, & Gerakaki, 2013;
Yang, Shu, McCandliss, & Zevin, 2013, etc.), but
only few of Second Language Acquisition (SLA).
The latter mostly simulate lexis and semantics ac-
quisition (e.g., Li & Farkas, 2002; Li, 2009; Cup-
pini, Magosso, & Ursino, 2013, etc.), and those
that address a higher level of language structure
usually do not model the existing L1 knowledge
(e.g., N. C. Ellis & Larsen-Freeman, 2009; Rap-
poport & Sheinman, 2005; but see Monner, Vatz,
Morini, Hwang, & DeKeyser, 2013).
At the same time, a number of theoretical SLA
issues are not well explained yet, including gen-
eral questions such as how existing knowledge of
the first language influences the acquisition of sec-
ond language. To give a specific example, it is not
clear yet when L1 structures lead to interference
and when they do not.
In this paper, we use an existing model of
early acquisition of argument structure construc-
tions (Alishahi & Stevenson, 2008) and adapt it
to bilingual input data, which allows us to inves-
tigate the acquisition process in second language
learners. We demonstrate in a number of compu-
tational simulations that our model replicates nat-
ural L2 developmental patterns and two specific
effects observed in human L2 learners, thus allow-
ing us to make certain predictions about the issues
under investigation.
2 Description of the model
A usage-based approach to language claims that
humans learn abstract linguistic regularities from
instances of language use. Specifically, gen-
eral argument structure constructions are predicted
to emerge over time from individual verb us-
ages which share syntactic and semantic proper-
47
ties. Argument structure constructions, according
to Goldberg, Casenhiser, and White (2007), are
?pairings of form and meaning that provide the
means of expressing simple propositions in a lan-
guage? (p. 74). Since nearly all human utterances
contain propositions, the learner?s knowledge of
argument structure constructions must reflect the
level of his grammatical competence.
The model of Alishahi and Stevenson (2008) is
based on this approach: the building block of the
model is an argument structure frame, a collec-
tion of syntactic and semantic features which rep-
resents a verb usage. Abstract constructions are
formed by detecting and clustering similar frames,
and various linguistic tasks are simulated by hav-
ing the model predict the most suitable values for
the missing features in a frame. These components
are described in the following sections.
2.1 Argument structure frames
In our SLA model, each frame contains the fol-
lowing features:
? Head verb in its infinitive form.
? Number of arguments that the verb takes.
? Semantic primitives of the verb represent-
ing the conceptual characteristics of the event
that the verb describes.
? Semantic properties of each argument rep-
resenting its conceptual meaning, indepen-
dently of the event that it participates in.
? Event-based properties of each argument
representing the characteristics each argu-
ment takes on in the particular event it is par-
ticipating in.
? Syntactic pattern of the utterance.
A sample frame is shown in Table 1. In Section 3.3
we will further explain how values for each frame
feature are selected.

usage Bill went through the maze.

Arg.2 sem. prop-s system, instrumentality, ...
Arg.1 event prop-s volitional, sentient, ...
Arg.2 event prop-s location, path, destination
Syntactic pattern AGENT V. through LOC.
2.2 Learning Constructions
Alishahi and Stevenson (2008) use an incremental
Bayesian algorithm for clustering similar frames
into constructions. Each input frame is compared
to all the existing constructions and a potentially
new one, and is added to the best matching con-
struction:
BestConstruction(F) = argmax
k
P(k|F) (1)
where k ranges over the indices of all constructions
(index 0 represents the new construction). Using
Bayes rule and dropping P(F) which is constant
for all k:
P(k|F) =
P(k)P(F |k)
P(F)
? P(k)P(F |k) (2)
The prior probability P(k) indicates the degree of
entrenchment of construction k:
P(k) =
Nk
N +1
,P(0) =
1
N +1
(3)
where Nk is the number of frames already clus-
tered in construction k, and N is the total number
of frames observed so far. The posterior probabil-
ity of a frame F is expressed in terms of the (sup-
posedly independent) probabilities of its features:
P(F |k) = ?
i?Features(F)
Pi( j|k) (4)
where j is the value of the ith feature of F , and
Pi( j|k) is the probability of displaying value j on
feature i within construction k. This probability is
estimated using a smoothed maximum likelihood
formula.1
2.3 Bilingual acquisition
We accept the view that L1 and L2 learning have
more commonalities than differences (see, e.g.,
MacWhinney, 2013), thus we do not explicitly en-
code the difference between the two languages. As
the learner perceives a frame, he is not aware of
which language the frame belongs to. All the in-
put data are processed equally, so that construc-
tions are formed in the same space and can contain
frames from both languages. Such approach al-
lows us to investigate how the existing L1 knowl-
edge influences L2 acquisition.
1For single-valued features such as the head verb, likeli-
hood is calculated by simply counting those members of con-
struction k whose value for feature i exactly matches value j.
For features with a set value such as the semantic properties
of the verb and the arguments, the likelihood is calculated by
comparing sets.

2.4 Sentence production
We use sentence production as our main evalua-
tion task for SLA. Given a frame which represents
an intended meaning through the semantic prop-
erties of an event (or verb) and its participants (or
arguments), we want to predict the most probable
values for the syntactic pattern feature. Following
Alishahi and Stevenson (2008), we estimate the
probability that feature i (in our case, the syntac-
tic pattern) displays value j given other observed
feature values in a partial frame F as
Pi( j|F) =?
k
Pi( j|k)P(k|F) (5)
=?
k
Pi( j|k)P(k)P(F |k)
The probabilities P(k), P(F |k) and Pi( j|k) are esti-
mated as before (see Equations 3 and 4). Ranging
over the possible values j of feature i, the value of
an unobserved feature can be predicted by maxi-
mizing Pi( j|F)2:
BestValuei(F) = argmax
j
Pi( j|F) (6)
3 Data
For cognitively plausible computational simula-
tions we had to prepare naturalistic input based
on the suitable corpora. While there are available
corpora that contain recordings of child-directed
speech (MacWhinney, 2000), the resources con-
taining speech addressed to L2 learners appear to
be very limited. Therefore, our choice of lan-
guages (German as a L1, and English as a L2) was
motivated first of all by the data availability. We
extracted naturalistic L1 and L2 data from two dif-
ferent sources.
3.1 Data sources
L2 English data were extracted from the Flens-
burg classroom corpus (Ja?kel, 2010) that contains
transcripts of lessons of English (as a foreign lan-
guage) taught to children in German schools that
cover all school age groups. We estimated the to-
tal number of occurrences of different verbs in the
corpus. From 20 most frequent verbs we selected
6 that represented syntactically and semantically
different linguistic constructions, since construc-
tional variability was one of the crucial factors for
2A non-deterministic alternative that we have to consider
in the future is to sample the feature value from the estimated
distribution.
the model. The verbs are: go, come, read, show,
look and put. For each verb, we extracted all its
occurrences from the corpus.
For L1 we used German data extracted from the
CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), namely
from adults? speech directed to three children:
Caroline (age from 0;10 to 4;3; von Stutterheim,
2004), Kerstin (from 1;3 to 3;4; M. Miller, 1979)
and Leo (from 1;11 to 4;11; Behrens, 2006). In
the same manner as for the English data, we se-
lected six verbs?machen ?to make?, kommen ?to
come?, gucken ?to look?, gehen ?to go?, sehen ?to
see? and geben ?to give?? and extracted all their
occurrences from the three corpora. Since the cor-
pora were of different size, the number of occur-
rences for some verbs were incomparable between
the corpora, thus we balanced the size of the sam-
ples used for further analysis by taking equal num-
bers of random verb uses from each corpus.
3.2 Data annotation
Since the basic input unit for our computational
model was a frame, we manually annotated all
the verb occurrences in order to extract frames.
Approximately 100 instances per verb were anno-
tated using the following general guidelines.
1. Instance grouping is based on the semantics
of the main verb and its arguments as well as
on the syntactic pattern.
2. We consider only arguments (both obligatory
and optional), but not adjuncts, since there
is evidence that the two are processed differ-
ently (see, e.g., Kennison, 2002).
3. We discard all instances where the main verb
was represented by a compound form or by
an infinitive, or appeared in a subordinate
clause, since in all these cases the ?core?
frame of the argument structure construction
might obtain additional structural or semantic
characteristics.
4. We do consider imperatives and questions
whose form does not contradict the previous
point.
5. We treat German prefixed/particle verbs (e.g.,
zumachen ?to close?) and English compound
verbs as an instance of the base verb (in this
case, machen ?to make?), given that the pre-
fixed/particle verb meaning is compositional
and the prefix/particle is actually separated.
6. Considering the previous point, each parti-
cle/prefix in our instances represents an in-
49
dependent semantic component (see, e.g.,
Dewell, 2011, for detailed explanation), and
we treat them as separate arguments.
7. We discard all the instances in which the verb
is used in a formulaic sequence (e.g.,, Wie
geht?s? ?How are you??), because formulaic
sequences are believed to be processed and
acquired as a whole (e.g., Wray, 2005; Ban-
nard & Lieven, 2012).
8. Finally, we eliminate the case marking in
German and use the Nominative case for
all the arguments, because this feature is
not crucial for our model, and there is ev-
idence that German children before the age
of 7 mostly rely on other features such as
word order (Dittmar, Abbot-Smith, Lieven,
& Tomasello, 2008).
3.3 Frame extraction
From the annotated data samples, for each verb we
extracted frames and their respective frequencies
of occurrence. Following Alishahi and Steven-
son (2010), the semantic primitives of verbs and
their arguments were semi-automatically extracted
from WordNet (G. A. Miller, 1995), and the event-
based properties of the arguments were manually
compiled.
The syntactic pattern of the frame not only
shows the order of the arguments, but also im-
plicitly includes information about their seman-
tic roles, i.e., AGENT, THEME, LOCATION, etc.
Note that these semantic labels are used only for
distinguishing between similar syntactic patterns
with the verb in the same position but swapped
arguments (cf. [so] schnell geht es vs. es geht
[so] schnell ?it goes [so] fast??both patterns oc-
cur rather frequently in German).3
Based on the manually extracted frames, an in-
put corpus of verb uses was automatically gener-
ated for each set of experiments. The frequency of
occurrence of each frame determined the probabil-
ity of selecting this frame, and the same method
was used for selecting specific arguments.
3Although the inclusion of semantic labels into syntac-
tic pattern makes the learning task easier, there is, in fact,
no agreement yet on how exactly children acquire the non-
canonical word order. They must rely on pragmatics, and this
phenomenon most thoroughly has been studied in the gener-
ative tradition under the name of scrambling, but still vari-
ous explanations were proposed (see, e.g., Mykhaylyk & Ko,
2011). Due to this uncertainty, we found it acceptable to pro-
vide the learner with the means to distinguish between the
patterns like in the example above, since it was highly impor-
tant for German with its partially free word order.
4 Simulations and results
In this section we report on computational simu-
lations that we ran using our model and the de-
scribed input data. We investigate general L2 de-
velopmental patterns, priming effects in SLA, and
the impact of skewed input on the learner?s L2 pro-
ficiency. Although the latter two are not SLA phe-
nomena per se and can be observed in L1 learners
as well, they have been discussed in SLA domain
and suit well our methodological framework.
4.1 L2 general development
Despite numerous attempts to capture and de-
scribe the dynamics of SLA, scholars admit that
there is no ?typical? profile of general L2 develop-
ment (for an overview, see Hasko, 2013). This is
because many variables are involved, such as the
learner?s L1, the age of L2 onset, amount of input,
type of instruction (if any), etc. They cause signif-
icant differences between individual learners and
specific linguistic phenomena.
Generally, L2 develops gradually, and second
language learners rarely achieve native-like L2
proficiency. To demonstrate that our model fol-
lows these patterns, we ran a number of simu-
lations to compare how L1 and L2 proficiency
changes over time. In our scenario, the learner
was first presented 500 L1 verb uses in small
steps (25 times 20 frames). After each step his
L1 proficiency was tested in the following way.
The learner was presented with 20 test frames in
which the syntactic pattern was removed, and had
to predict the most suitable syntactic pattern, re-
lying on his current knowledge. We should note
that because German has partially free word or-
der, our German data contained a substantial num-
ber of frame groups consisting of two or more
frames that were almost identical and differed only
in the order of arguments in their syntactic pat-
terns (i.e., AGENT verb THEME and THEME verb
AGENT). These patterns are very close both lin-
guistically (i.e., they carry very similar meanings)
and algorithmically (i.e., the learner?s preference
for one of them is determined only by their re-
spective frequencies of occurrence in the input).
Therefore, asking the learner to predict the exact
pattern would not be a fair task. For this reason,
during the evaluation we only checked whether the
pattern produced by the learner contained exactly
the same set of arguments (and, possibly, the same
preposition) as the target pattern. Thus, AGENT
50
kommen THEME, kommen AGENT THEME, and
THEME kommen AGENT were considered equal for
the purpose of evaluation.
After the initial 25 steps of L1 training and test-
ing, the learner was presented 500 more frames
(25 times 20) which could be either from L1 or
from L2 data in proportion 3 (L1) to 1 (L2). This
way we simulated a common situation when a
child starts learning a foreign language at school,
thus being exposed to input from both languages,
but L1 input prevails. The results averaged over
10 simulations (Figure 1) demonstrate that the L2
proficiency does not achieve that of L1.4

Figure 1: L1 and L2 development over time
We explain the lower L2 proficiency by two fac-
tors. First, by the moment when the learner started
receiving L2 input, L1 constructions were already
formed in his memory, so the L1 entrenchment
prevented L2 constructions to fully emerge. Sec-
ond, even within the period of SLA the amount of
L2 input was 3 times smaller compared to that of
L1. To investigate whether both factors were in-
deed important, we tried to eliminate each of them
separately, i.e., to present both L1 and L2 from
the very beginning keeping the ratio 3:1 (Figure 2,
left), or to set an equal ratio while keeping the late
age of L2 onset (Figure 2, right). As we can see, in
neither case does the L2 proficiency reach that of
L1. However, when both factors are eliminated?
that is, from the very beginning the learner re-
ceives mixed L1/L2 input in equal proportion?
he reaches comparable levels of L1 and L2 profi-
ciency (Figure 3).
Additionally, we tried to separately manipulate
each of the two parameters keeping the other one
constant. We expected that (1) the lower the L2
age of onset, the higher the learner?s proficiency at
each moment of time with the L1/L2 ratio set at
3:1, and (2) the smaller the L1/L2 ratio (down to
1, when the amount of input is equal), the higher

no evidence for either effect. Part of the expla-
nation might be that there was a substantial over-
lap between L1 and L2 syntactic patterns (espe-
cially considering we treated patterns as sets of
elements irrespective of word order). Therefore
the learner?s existing L1 knowledge may indirectly
have contributed to the L2 proficiency, in a pattern
known as ?positive transfer? (see, e.g., Benson,
2002). This can be demonstrated by comparing
the initial slopes of L2 development lines in Fig-
ure 1 and Figure 2a. In the former case, represent-
ing L2 exposure after L1 constructions have al-
ready been entrenched, L2 acquisition goes faster
in its initial stages, because the learner has, in fact,
already acquired a number of syntactic patterns
that are shared by the two languages. Monner et al
(2013), who computationally studied the effect of
French L1 entrenchment on Spanish L2 grammat-
ical gender learning, explain an exception in their
results in similar fashion. However, this requires
further investigation, possibly in simulations in-
volving two languages that are typologically more
distant.
4.2 Priming effects in L2
Structural priming effects, when speakers tend to
recreate a recently encountered linguistic structure
in further language use, have been demonstrated
both in first (e.g., Bock, Dell, Chang, & Onishi,
2007; Potter & Lombardi, 1998, etc.) and in sec-
ond language (e.g., McDonough, 2006; Gries &
51
Wulff, 2005) as well as across the two (e.g., Loe-
bell & Bock, 2003; Vasilyeva et al, 2010). Some
of these effects are explained in terms of construc-
tion grammar?primes can activate the respective
constructions (see Goldberg & Bencini, 2005).
To give a specific example, Gries and Wulff
(2005) asked L1 German learners of English to
complete sentence fragments after being exposed
to a prime sentence, which contained either a
prepositional dative (The racing driver showed the
torn overall to the team manager.) or a ditransitive
construction (The racing driver showed the helpful
mechanic the damaged tyre). The sentences pro-
duced by the learners demonstrated the construc-
tional priming effect in L2 acquisition, which was
also supported by corpus and sorting evidence (see
Gries & Wulff, 2005, for details).
Since in our model we explicitly assume the ex-
istence of constructions in learner?s memory, we
should be able to observe constructional priming
effects in L2. To investigate this, we partially sim-
ulated the experiment of Gries and Wulff (2005)
computationally. First the model was presented
with 250 L1 verb uses5, after which, like in the
previous experiment, L2 was introduced in paral-
lel with L1 in small steps (25 times 10 frames).
After each step, the learner was additionally pre-
sented with one of two primes. Priming frames,
which we took from the actual dataset, were uses
of the verb show with variable arguments, and the
only difference between the two primes was the
syntactic pattern?a prepositional dative or a di-
transitive (see Table 2).

5Since the impact of a single priming frame on the learner
could be insignificant, we used a smaller step size in these
simulations.
In the experiment by Gries and Wulff (2005)
learners, after seeing a prime, were presented with
a test fragment consisting of an agent and a verb
(The racing driver showed ...), and were required
to continue the sentence. In terms of our model,
the test frame consisted of the head verb (show)
and its semantic primitives, total number of argu-
ments, the first argument (pronoun you) and its se-
mantic and event properties. The other features
(i.e., syntactic patterns and all the properties of
the other two arguments) were missing, and the
learner had to predict the best syntactic pattern for
the test frame. After the prediction was made, both
prime and test frame were discarded in order not
to influence further results, and the learning con-
tinued.
Since we investigated priming effects in ditran-
sitive (D) and prepositional dative (P) construc-
tions, in the further analysis we only looked at the
two respective syntactic patterns in the learner?s
production. That is, we calculated how many pat-
terns of each type were produced after each prime
(i.e., D-patterns after D-prime, P-patterns after D-
prime, P-patterns after P-prime, and D-patterns
after P-prime). Additionally, we ran an identi-
cal baseline simulation where the learner was not
primed, being presented a test frame immediately
after each learning step. Figure 4 shows how many
P- and D-patterns were produced in each of the
three conditions (P-prime, D-prime and no prime;
the results are averaged over 100 simulations).

As we can see, on the initial 5-10 steps of
development both P- and D-patterns were pro-
duced substantially more often after the respective
matching prime (the jump of the dotted line on
each plot) than after the non-matching prime or af-
ter no prime. After some time, however, the prim-
ing effect was leveled off, presumably because of
the exposure to large amounts of training data, and
the frequency of production of each of the two pat-
terns aligned with the actual frequency of occur-
52
rence of the respective pattern in the training data
(31 for D-pattern, 3 for P-pattern).
On the one hand, the presence of the priming
effect in our results is in line with the findings of
Gries and Wulff (2005). On the other hand, their
participants were advanced foreign learners of En-
glish who must have achieved rather high profi-
ciency in L2 by the moment of study, but they were
still sensitive to the priming effect?a result that
we could not replicate computationally.
4.3 Skewed vs. balanced L2 input
There is an ongoing discussion in the literature on
the supposed facilitatory effect of skewed input on
constructional acquisition, summarized by Boyd
and Goldberg (2009). In monolingual contexts, it
has been demonstrated that children (Casenhiser
& Goldberg, 2005) and adults (Goldberg, Casen-
hiser, & Sethuraman, 2004) acquire a novel con-
struction with artificial verbs faster if one verb has
higher token frequency in the input compared to
the other verbs, and slower in case of balanced in-
put, with all the verbs having equal token frequen-
cies.
As for SLA, N. C. Ellis and Ferreira-
Junior (2009) showed that the distribution of
verbs/constructions in input to L2 learners is Zip-
fian, and that the most frequent verb in each con-
struction is acquired first. However, they do not
provide evidence for a facilitatory effect of skewed
distribution on construction learning. At the same
time, there is experimental evidence that high
type frequency facilitates the acquisition of wh-
questions in L2 (McDonough & Kim, 2009).
Year and Gordon (2009) experimentally studied
the facilitatory effect of skewed verb frequency
in the input on L2 constructional learning. In
their study, L1 Korean learners of English were
presented with 5 English verbs in the ditransitive
construction, where either all the verbs appeared
equally often (balanced input), or one verb ap-
peared 6 times more often than the other (skewed
input). The learners? knowledge of the construc-
tion was assessed in the elicited production and
acceptability judgement task. The exposure and
testing procedures were distributed over 8 weeks,
or over 4 weeks, or over 4 days, depending on the
group. Surprisingly, in no group they found the
evidence for the facilitatory effect of skewed in-
put. These findings contrast with those in the other
studies that we mentioned.
In order to address this issue computationally,
we ran simulations using our model. Unlike Year
and Gordon (2009) who investigated the acqui-
sition of one construction only, we assessed the
general L2 knowledge of all constructions that the
learner was exposed to, since our model is per-
fectly suited for this.
The frequency distribution of verbs in our nat-
uralistic L2 input was not uniform (79-81-61-58-
48-29), however the most frequent verb appeared
approximately 3 times more often than the least
frequent, which was not comparable to the ratio
of 1:6 in the study by Year and Gordon (2009).
Thus, in addition to the natural data we introduced
two more conditions. First, we estimated the dis-
tribution of verbs over different constructions in
our data and concluded that two verbs?go and
show?accounted for most syntactic patterns in
the input. Therefore, to prepare truly skewed input
data, we set the frequencies for these two verbs to
30 and for the other verbs to 16. Second, we pre-
pared the balanced input data by setting the fre-
quency of each verb to 1.
Using the three types of input, we ran the exact
same simulations as for investigating the general
developmental pattern, and compared the learner?s
L2 proficiency over time in the three conditions.
The results are shown in Figure 5.

As we can see, the learner?s proficiencies with
the natural and balanced input data do not dif-
fer much. However, the facilitatory effect of
the skewed frequencies in the input is very ev-
ident. Thus, our findings constrast with the re-
sults of Year and Gordon (2009), but are in line
with the general trend as summarized by Boyd and
6Although the ratio of 30:1 is much higher than that in
the experiment being simulated, we had to account for the
fact that individual frames within each verb were assigned
their own frequencies, so a high-frequency frame of a low-
frequency verb could still appear more often in the input than
a low-frequency frame of a high-frequency verb. We ex-
cluded this possibility by setting the ratio to the high value.

Goldberg (2009). We agree with Year and Gor-
don?s (2009) explanation that the lack of facili-
tatory effect that they found can be explained by
the presentation order of the high-frequency verbs.
Goldberg et al (2007) demonstrated the effect of
the presentation order of high- and low-frequency
stimuli on the learners? performance. We believe
that due to the rather large ratio 30:1 that we set
in the skewed data, the two high-frequency verbs
prevailed in the L2 input from the very initial stage
of L2 learning, therefore our simulations were
closer to the ?skewed first? condition of Goldberg
et al (2007) than to the ?skewed random? condi-
tion.
We have to note, however, that the facilitatory
effect observed in our experiment could also be
due to the fact that the distribution of the verbs in
the test frames was also different for each of the
three conditions, since the test data were sampled
from the same distribution as the training data. We
will further investigate this issue in the future.
5 Discussion
Patterns of second language development have
been studied for decades, starting from the mor-
pheme learning studies in 1970s (e.g., Wode,
1976). Although some classroom studies allow
SLA theorists to make inferences about general
L2 developmental patterns (e.g., R. Ellis, 1994;
VanPatten & Benati, 2010), scholars agree that a
typical pattern of L2 development can hardly exist
due to the inherent complexity of the SLA process.
The enormous variability of L2 learning condi-
tions makes it difficult to provide general conclu-
sions about SLA development. Partly for this rea-
son, most longitudinal studies have been focusing
on the development of specific linguistic features
in small number of individuals (see an overview
by Ortega & Iberri-Shea, 2005). DeKeyser (2013)
emphasizes the methodological difficulties in this
domain, especially when it comes to studying age
effects in the second language of immigrant pop-
ulation. The inherent problems of documenting
the individuals? language experience and sampling
those learners who match a number of specific cri-
teria make the research in this field very laborious
and time-consuming.
In contrast, a computational framework can be
effectively used for studying the complexities of
learning a second language, specifically in rela-
tion to the characteristics of the first language.
We present a computational model of second lan-
guage acquisition which investigates grammatical
L2 development in connection with the existing L1
knowledge, a setup that has not been properly ad-
dressed by the existing computational models of
SLA (but see Monner et al, 2013).
We evaluate the model?s acquired grammati-
cal knowledge (in the form of emergent argument
structure constructions) through sentence produc-
tion. Our simulations replicate the expected pat-
terns of L2 development, such as gradual emer-
gence of constructions and increased proficiency
in sentence production. Moreover, we investigate
two specific SLA phenomena: construction prim-
ing and the facilitative effect of skewed frequen-
cies in the input.
Priming effects have been demonstrated in sec-
ond language learners (Gries & Wulff, 2005),
although sometimes inconsistently (McDonough,
2006). We replicate a priming effect at the early
stages of learning in our simulations, but this ef-
fect diminishes as the model receives more in-
put. Systematic manipulation of various (poten-
tially relevant) factors via computational simula-
tion will shed more light on the nature of priming
in SLA.
The facilitative effect of skewed input on con-
struction learning has been subject of much debate
(Boyd & Goldberg, 2009). Our experiments show
that skewed frequencies in the input can improve
the performance of the model in sentence produc-
tion, but more careful investigation of this pattern
is needed for a clear picture of the interaction be-
tween different parameters.
Although some of our results are inconclu-
sive, we believe that our preliminary experiments
clearly demonstrate the opportunities of the model
for SLA research. In the future we plan investi-
gating the described and other phenomena more
thoroughly. Applying additional methods such as
analysis of the frame categorization structure un-
der different conditions, or quantitative compari-
son of the production data obtained in computa-
tional simulations and in the natural learner cor-
pora (Gries & Wulff, 2005), could help us to draw
specific implications for the SLA theory.
