Abstract 
This present work deliberately abandons 
the purpose of capturing the global 
resemblance between languages and the 
ambition of giving a rational foundation to 
probability of changes in linguistics, to 
focus instead on cladistic approach, which 
was applied to different dialects and data 
(gallo-romance, southern italo-romance) 
through an original coding of philological 
derivations. Results show good congruence 
with linguistic classification and provide 
new insight on how tackle various 
dialectological problems as borrowings. 
1 Introduction 
In the last decades, theoretical developments in the 
field of the biological evolution of species and 
populations have been combined with increasing 
computer facilities, which are likely to change the 
practice of phylogeny reconstruction drastically. 
Attempts to shift such a practice in order to 
reconstruct the evolution of language have been 
proposed, since the middle of the 20th century, as 
evidenced by several publications that display the 
whole range of methodologies. One of these 
approaches, called Numerical Taxonomy, consists 
in estimating some linguistic distances between 
pairs of languages, from which evolutionary trees 
or networks are inferred to produce some linguistic 
classifications. This approach is classically used in 
dialectometry. (Evrard, 1964; Goebl, 1981, 1987, 
Scapoli et al, 2005, Ben Hamed, 2005). A more 
recent approach, based on Bayesian principles, 
suggests to attach some probabilities to each 
linguistic change (Gray et al 2003), looking for the 
most likely tree, given the model and the observed 
data. Finally, the last kind of approach, inherited 
from XIXth century linguists, is the cladistic 
approach, as formalized by Hennig (1950) and 
clearly advocated by some linguists, although 
using various methodologies (Hoenigswald and 
Wiener, 1987; Wang, 1988; Holden, 2001; Ringe 
et al, 2002; Rexova et al, 2003; Nakhleh et al, 
2005; Ben Hamed et al, 2005). 
The present work is focusing on cladistics, 
abandoning the purpose of capturing the global 
resemblance between languages and the ambition 
of giving a rational foundation to probability of 
linguistic changes, adopting instead a strategy 
enabling us to integrate linguistic hypotheses 
before drawing inference on the evolution of 
linguistic traits and languages, and possibly to 
refute them. To check the heuristic value of this 
methodology, we endeavour to apply cladistics to 
dialectal data from different sources, hoping to 
bring forward and discuss some arguments on their 
diversification in space and time. As far as we 
know, cladistic is more often applied to language 
families than to dialect areas, so that our research 
is pioneering the field, raising the controversial 
question concerning the best representation of 
dialectal diversity: tree-like and/or networks. 
2 The data 
2.1 O?l Dialect1. We began our experiment with 
the o?l dialects, our starting point being the 
                                                 
1 O?l Dialect indicates the branch of the gallo-Romance 
languages developed in the North of France, south of 
Belgium (Walloon Area) and inthe Anglo-Normans 
islands. 
23
Linguistic Atlas of France (ALF, Gilli?ron and 
Edmont,1902-1910, reprint: 1968) which has 
already been extensively exploited by others in a 
context of global resemblance (Goebl, 1981, 
1992). In order to delimit a precise and 
homogeneous field, the characters observed are 
limited only to the vocalism of these dialects, 
mainly stressed and oral vowels, even if a few 
series of facts from nasal and unstressed vocalism 
are taken into account. As far as the O?l data is 
concerned, the selected localities amount to 45, 
from East to West, in order to limit our scope in 
this first attempt (figure 2).

Table 1. Selected words from ALF and ALI 
Atlases. In parentheses is the number of 
derivations (states) for each selected world 
 
We selected 23 words from the ALF (Table 1), 
yielding a variable number of forms or phonetic 
changes, representing the stressed vocalism of the 
dialects of O?l (short/long, high/mid/low vowels in 
open and close syllabic context). 
 
2.2 Southern Italo-Romance (SIR). We then 
applied the same type of cladistic analysis to the 
dialects of the dialectal area of Southern Italo-
Romance. We made use of the data relating to the 
consonant system of these dialects, with ALI 
(Atlante Linguistico dell' Italia, 1995) as a source. 
In this case, 21 localities were sampled for this 
analysis, picking up three varieties for each main 
dialect of these areas (northern, central, and 
southern: 3 for Campanian, Basilian, Apulian, 
Calabrian, Sicilian and Salentinian, including also 
three varieties of Sardinian). The lexical sample 
amounts to 20 words (Table 1). 
3 Cladistic analysis  
3.1 Linguistic prolegomena. From the quoted 
corpora, diachronic trees were created using the 
existing bibliography (Chauveau, 1989; Pignon, 
1960). But we must reckon and point out that we 
had a very hard time in trying to make sense out of 
contradictory or underspecified accounts on chains 
of phonetic changes available in the literature. We 
found out ? to our bewilderment ? that most 
phonetic changes are quite often telescoped in 
handbooks of Romance dialectology, monographs, 
and Ph.D. dissertations, giving only the first and 
the last stage of phonetic changes: *A > D, instead 
of *A > *B > *C > D. We therefore had to rely on 
principles of areologic continuity, as the process of 
stepping is made hazardous by the vacuum on the 
successive stages of the sound changes in the 
literature, in particular in the peripheral varieties of 
o?l (except in Chauveau?s monographs on western 
O?l dialects). These principles are the following: 
Pr.1. Principle of areologic continuity: implies a 
gradual theory of linguistic change whose stages 
can be reconstructed on the basis of areal 
configurations. It entails that stages *B and *C of a 
*A > D change are available on the maps in current 
dialects not far from a contiguous centre of gravity. 
For instance, in western o?l dialects, *e > oi goes 
through a *e > ei > ai > oi vowel shift whose *ai 
phase is still to be seen on the ALF maps in the 
neighbourhood, but it is not akin with the far 
distant *e > oi change in the East (in Romance 
lorrain), where the chain *e > ei >oi does not entail 
an *ai phase. 
Pr.2. Principle of parsimony: it claims that the 
vocalic system develops with parsimony the 
strategies of change; not more than two or three 
major structural options from which the later 
evolutions unfold.  
Pr.3. Principle of unitarianism and naturalness: 
dialectal idiosyncrasies should be rare upstream 
and abundant downstream. In other words, change 
is strongly constrained typologically closer to the 
root of the stepping tree, and gets more and more 
24
free at the end of the branches. One should be 
cautious with the intricate complexity of 
explanations found in monographs and handbooks 
on idiosyncrasy of changes in local dialects. More 
simply, one could state that changes are 
constrained according to UG (Universal Grammar) 
principles on the first hand, and specified by local, 
language or dialect-specific parameters on the 
second hand. 
3.2. Cladistic procedure. In order to apply 
cladistic procedure to linguistic data, one has first 
to find a way to code the trees of philological 
derivations through a coding procedure which 
takes into account all the hypotheses assumed by 
the linguists. In a second step, the field 
observations have to be coded, and, finally, tree 
building algorithms are implemented to meet 
optimal criteria, i.e. parsimony in this context. 
However, within the framework of this necessarily 
short paper, we will only discuss tree structure, 
tackling briefly the feasible reconstruction of 
ancestral state at nodes, but keeping detailed 
development  for further presentation. 
3.2.1 Character coding 
Figure 1a shows how the relationships between 
vocalic variations of a given word (?P?re?, as an 
example) are coded. Each variant takes the value 0 
or 1 depending on its place within the tree 
derivation. First, a matrix is built (figure 1b), 
where rows stand for the coding of the variants, 
whereas columns hold for the transformations from 
a plesiomorphic variant (the initial diachronic 
state, or etymon) to an apomorphic one (the 
terminal state, or synchronic reflexes). For 
example, the inferred variant, *a? (lettered A), 
derived from the late latin variant of the A[ 2 
variable, is coded by the vector [0000000], being 
the ancestral variant, while its derived reflexes are 
all coded 1, in the first column. Likewise, the 
apomorphic variant ?:? (lettered F) is coded by the 
vector [1001100], the first 1 indicates that this 
variant is derived from the ? variant (B), and the 
fourth and fifth 1 indicate that it is also derived 
successively from ??? to ??:?? (B?>E) and from ?
?:?? to ? ?:?? (E?>F).  
                                                 
2 A[ reads as classical latin low vowel in open syllable 
as in PA-TREM, MA-REM (noted < [ >, whereas < ] > 
stands for a closed syllabe as in ?AR- : AR-CUM, AR-
TEM).

Figure 1: tree of derivation of the word ?P?re? (a), 
its factorized (c) and matrix (d) representations. 
Each column in (b) corresponds to a change in the 
tree derivation. The vector W allows a weighting 
of each shift (example of a 423433 weight-chain, 
values being expressed above each arrow, and in 
red colour). The arrows indicate the orientation of 
changes. Backward changes have an infinity 
weight. The (c) matrix provides equivalent 
information, with i holding for infinity weight. (b) 
and (c) representations are fitted for PHYLIP and 
PAUP respectively. 
 
Since the transformations can be estimated to be 
more or less current in term of phonological 
naturalness, they can be weighed by giving heavy 
weights for natural or rare transformations and 
light weights for easy transformations. In this 
work, character weight was ranged on a scale 
between 1 and 5 (e.g. w [423433], figure 1).  
Lastly, since the transformations are polarized, 
meaning that we hypothesize the absence of 
backward changes, we allocate an infinite weight 
for reversal transformation (i.e. no reversion 
allowed). This kind of coding is routinely used by 
phylogeneticists (see PHYLIP or PAUP software). 
All the derivation trees are available on request.

3.2.2. Data coding and tree reconstruction 
Once the character coding step is performed for 
all the words investigated (23 different words for 
the O?l data (ALF), 20 for SIR (ALI)), each area or 
dialect is coded according to the previous coding. 
In the example of the O?l investigation, data were 
collected for 45 geographical different areas 
(figure 2), each of them having its own way to 
pronounce each of the 23 words of the sample. For 
example (Table 2), the row ? 16Bourg 3? has the 
variant C for the first word (?P?re?) described on 
the first column. This means that this area as well 
as the area numbered 45, 59, 65, and 143 share the 
same derived variant: ??? (labelled C, figure 1), 
while the rows labelled 108 and 153 share the ??:? 
reflex variant (B), variants that they inherited 
either from some common ancestor or because of 
geographical proximity.

Table 2: Part of the data matrix from the ALF 
sample. First column is ?P?re? coding.  
 
Finally, each letter of this data matrix is replaced 
by its coding (figure 1b), as it has been done in the 
previous step (character coding). For instance the 
letter C, column 1 (figure 2) is replaced by the 
vector [1100000], the letter B by [1000000]. The 
tree building reconstruction is carried out from this 
final matrix which sums up all the linguistic 
hypotheses (tree of philological derivation, polarity 
of changes, weighting, and geographic variants).  
Factorisation are performed with FACTOR 
software (Felsenstein, 2004), parsimonious trees 
being obtained with PAUP* (v4.0) (Swofford, 
2002), using TBR (tree-bisection-reconnection), 
random agglomeration option (100), holding 6 best 
trees at each steps. Tree length, consistency index 
and retention index are also estimated. The most 
parsimonious trees are then plotted figures 3 and 4. 
An example of inferred parallelism is also shown 
on figure 3. Once clades are well characterized, it 
becomes possible to count the number of 
parallelisms that are shared within each clade and

4 Results 
4.1. In the O?l dialects tree (figures 2 and 3), the 
central varieties appear as a clade (C1, from 
251Champagne NO to 478Noirmoutier, fuchsia 
and yellow clades), which gathers the dialects of 
the Paris basin and those of the mid-west plains, 
and includes peripheral spots, like Noirmoutier 
(478) or Saintongeais (518Saintonge). This major 
node (Center-Western macro-area) makes up a unit 
of the great mid-west, having the subset Normano-
Picardo-Gallo (C2 and C3) as a peripheral compact 
core. Opposite to this, a very consistent and 
geographically gradual unit clustering the Franc-
Comtois and the Walloon (C4, from 153Lorraine S 
to 197Wallon O, green clade) varieties, in the 
Eastern part of the macro-dialect network of 
Northern Gallo-Romance (i.e., o?l), together with 
26
the Romance Lorraine 4  dialects. In addition to 
these great divisions between Central-Western o?l 
and Peripheric Eastern o?l, which is fairly 
consistent with current classifications of o?l 
dialects (Goebl, 1984, 2002), the advantage of this 
tree lies in the consistency of the inner structures 
of the major or intermediate clades.  
 
Table 3 gives the estimation of the number of 
parallelisms and/or borrowings within and between 
clades. Clearly the number of parallelism observed 
within each clades turns out to be more intense 
within than between clades.

4.2. Concerning the Southern Italo-Romance 
(SIR), from Naples to Sicily and Sardinia, the 
congruence between the cladistic tree (figure 4) 
and the philological classifications is satisfactory 
(Goebl, 1984; Grassi et al, 1997), and most of 
novelties lay in the inner structures of the tree. The 
phylogram of the SIR shows three major divisions 
(figure 4): two peripheries, the first one gathering 
Sardinian Central-Southerner varieties (786 and 
748) and the southernmost apulien (818) (red 
cluster), and the second one (fuchsia) grouping the 
central-northern apulian (846,828)) as an external 
branch with the southernmost basilian and central 
salentino (868 and 917) This last branch is 
connected to an inner group which separates the 
branch from Sicilian-Sardinian-Salentino (in blue) 
from the campano-calabro-basilian (green and 
yellow). A most interesting detail is the place of 
818Apul, a Gallo-Romance francoproven?al 
dialect settled in two villages (Faeto and Celle) San 
Vito by the Angevine dynasty in Northern Apulia 
during the 13th century. This dialect, previously

German type) spoken around Metz, whereas Romance 
Lorrain o?l dialects are or were spoken around Nancy 
and in the Vosges hills. 
spoken in the Ain and Is?re departments in France, 
got into close, symbiotic contact with Apulian, a 
dialect of the SIR type. The cladistic procedure 
grasped accurately its allogenic structure, 
clustering it in the upper branch, along with 
Sardinian ? also a distinct language as compared to 
SIR- which should therefore considered as a 
?foreign languages branch? rather than a peripheric 
node of the SIR continuum. 
5 Discussion  
The cladistic approach developed here provides a 
convenient way to integrate and test various 
hypotheses concerning the linguistic changes. 
Particularly, the rare or relative absence of 
backmutation in phonological characters is 
correctly taken into account by forbidden reverse 
changes, and complex relationships between states 
of traits are easily handled, unlike most of the other 
methods (as network approaches). The parsimony 
criterion consists to optimise the tree in minimising 
parallelism. The residual inferred parallelisms 
could clearly be visualized simply by looking at 
the places they occur along the tree (as exemplified 
figure 3). A way to circumvent the parallelism 
problem, when several parsimonious trees are 
found, would be using a successive weighting 
process which looks for parsimonious trees by 
assigning to each trait a weight inversely 
proportional to its degree of homoplasy (only 
parallelism in our case since reversion are not 
allowed) (Farris 1969). No such a process was 
necessary with our dataset since only one 
parsimonious tree was found. However, the 
robustness of the parsimonious tree remains 
difficult to evaluate, as long as only few words are 
integrated in our dataset (only 23 and 20 for Oil 
and SIR data respectively), particularly to 
appropriately implement resampling procedures 
(bootstrap or jackknife).  
At this stage of interpretation, one cannot 
differentiate between parallel development and 
borrowing, unless some a priori are introduced to 
do so. In our data set, parallelisms are frequent 
(leading to a weak CI) although our two 
parsimonious trees are unique and well resolved 
(actually, there is no simple relation between CI 
and tree resolution) preventing us using various

approaches are not able, as far as we know, to 
handle large amount of polarized changes and 
complex weighted multistate relationships. On the 
other hand, our strategy turns out to be quite 
different from the one proposed by Nakhelh et al
(2006) which first apply compatibility method to 
select the best traits allowing to retain few trees 
considered as ?almost perfect phylogenies? 
(missing the phylogenetic information brought by 
the other traits), and then to parsimoniously handle 
the remaining traits as possible edges representing 
borrowing, (but not giving the possibility of 
modifying the tree structure accordingly). An 
additional advantage (only lightly evoked in this 
paper) of the cladistic approach is to allow 
inferring changes of the traits along the tree, 
suggesting some linguistic scenarios, as correlated 
changes, borrowings ?

6 Conclusions  
We shall conclude this pioneering cladistic survey 
of phyla and dialect networks pointing out at three 
main assets of our data processing : i) unlike most 
of current and past research in taxonomy applied to 
linguistic data, we tried to do much more than 
merely computing distance and similarity between 
lists of lexical cognates with a binary procedure: 
we processed data according to geolinguistic 
analysis, using area linguistic procedures and 
phonological markedness theory in endowing 
weight to reflexes, ii) our results are mainly 
congruent and consistent with current 
classification, but intricate patterns in the inner 
structures of cladistic nodes also challenging these 
classifications, iii) In spite of the small number of 
words presently studied here, but thanks to 
accurate data and proper sampling from the ALF 
and ALI database, it turns out that, by applying 
cladistics, for long advocated by linguists, one can 
obtain consistent, reliable (and possibly refutable) 
results. This is not always the case in the 
processing of fuzzy data and mere lists of words. 
29
Linguists and cladisticians should therefore be 
cautious about word-lists, and should as well rely 
on linguistic atlases, which provide the widest 
array of sampling, and high quality data gathered 
through fieldwork by highly trained professionals. 
In other words, to put it straightforwardly, well 
managed empiricism is a sine qua non condition 
for reliable results in quantitative linguistics, 
especially as far as cladistics is concerned, due to 
the powerfulness of the procedure.
