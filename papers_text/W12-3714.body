Abstract
This paper presents our research on automatic
annotation of a five-billion-word corpus of
Japanese blogs with information on affect and
sentiment. We first perform a study in emotion
blog corpora to discover that there has been
no large scale emotion corpus available for
the Japanese language. We choose the largest
blog corpus for the language and annotate it
with the use of two systems for affect anal-
ysis: ML-Ask for word- and sentence-level
affect analysis and CAO for detailed anal-
ysis of emoticons. The annotated informa-
tion includes affective features like sentence
subjectivity (emotive/non-emotive) or emo-
tion classes (joy, sadness, etc.), useful in affect
analysis. The annotations are also general-
ized on a 2-dimensional model of affect to ob-
tain information on sentence valence/polarity
(positive/negative) useful in sentiment analy-
sis. The annotations are evaluated in several
ways. Firstly, on a test set of a thousand sen-
tences extracted randomly and evaluated by
over forty respondents. Secondly, the statistics
of annotations are compared to other existing
emotion blog corpora. Finally, the corpus is
applied in several tasks, such as generation of
emotion object ontology or retrieval of emo-
tional and moral consequences of actions.
1 Introduction
There is a lack of large corpora for Japanese ap-
plicable in sentiment and affect analysis. Although
there are large corpora of newspaper articles, like
Mainichi Shinbun Corpus1, or corpora of classic lit-
erature, like Aozora Bunko2, they are usually un-
suitable for research on emotions since spontaneous

2http://www.aozora.gr.jp/
emotive expressions either appear rarely in these
kinds of texts (newspapers), or the vocabulary is not
up to date (classic literature). Although there ex-
ist speech corpora, such as Corpus of Spontaneous
Japanese3, which could become suitable for this
kind of research, due to the difficulties with com-
pilation of such corpora they are relatively small.
In research such as the one by Abbasi and Chen
(2007) it was proved that public Internet services,
such as forums or blogs, are a good material for af-
fect analysis because of their richness in evaluative
and emotive information. One kind of these services
are blogs, open diaries in which people encapsu-
late their own experiences, opinions and feelings to
be read and commented by other people. Recently
blogs have come into the focus of opinion mining or
sentiment and affect analysis (Aman and Szpakow-
icz, 2007; Quan and Ren, 2010). Therefore creating
a large blog-based emotion corpus could help over-
come both problems: the lack in quantity of corpora
and their applicability in sentiment and affect anal-
ysis. There have been only a few small Japanese
emotion corpora developed so far (Hashimoto et al.,
2011). On the other hand, although there exist large
Web-based corpora (Erjavec et al., 2008; Baroni and
Ueyama, 2006), access to them is usually allowed
only from the Web interface, which makes addi-
tional annotations with affective information diffi-
cult. In this paper we present the first attempt to au-
tomatically annotate affect on YACIS, a large scale
corpus of Japanese blogs. To do that we use two sys-
tems for affect analysis of Japanese, one for word-
and sentence-level affect analysis and another espe-
cially for detailed analysis of emoticons, to annotate
on the corpus different kinds of affective informa-
tion (emotive expressions, emotion classes, etc.).

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section
2 describes the related research in emotion corpora.
Section 3 presents our choice of the corpus for anno-
tation of affect- and sentiment-related information.
Section 4 describes tools used in annotation. Sec-
tion 5 presents detailed data and evaluation of the
annotations. Section 6 presents tasks in which the
corpus has already been applied. Finally the paper
is concluded and future applications are discussed.
2 Emotion Corpora
Research on Affect Analysis has resulted in a
number of systems developed within several years
(Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Ptaszynski et al.,
2009c; Matsumoto et al., 2011). Unfortunately,
most of such research ends in proposing and evaluat-
ing a system. The real world application that would
be desirable, such as annotating affective informa-
tion on linguistic data is limited to processing a usu-
ally small test sample in the evaluation. The small
number of annotated emotion corpora that exist are
mostly of limited scale and are annotated manually.
Below we describe and compare some of the most
notable emotion corpora. Interestingly, six out of
eight emotion corpora described below are created
from blogs. The comparison is summarized in Table
1. We also included information on the work de-
scribed in this paper for better comparison (YACIS).
Quan and Ren (2010) created a Chinese emotion
blog corpus Ren-CECps1.0. They collected 500
blog articles from various Chinese blog services,
such as sina blog (http://blog.sina.com.cn/), qq blog
(http://blog.qq.com/), etc., and annotated them with
a large variety of information, such as emotion class,
emotive expressions or polarity level. Although syn-
tactic annotations were simplified to tokenization
and POS tagging, this corpus can be considered a
state-of-the-art emotion blog corpus. The motiva-
tion for Quan and Ren is also similar to ours - deal-
ing with the lack of large corpora for sentiment anal-
ysis in Chinese (in our case - Japanese).
Wiebe et al. (2005) report on creating the MPQA
corpus of news articles. The corpus contains 10,657
sentences in 535 documents4. The annotation
schema includes a variety of emotion-related infor-

ditional 157 documents, 692 documents in total.
mation, such as emotive expressions, emotion va-
lence, intensity, etc. However, Wiebe et al. focused
on detecting subjective (emotive) sentences, which
do not necessarily convey emotions, and classifying
them into positive and negative. Thus their annota-
tion schema, although one of the richest, does not
include emotion classes.
A corpus of Japanese blogs, called KNB, rich in
the amount and diversification of annotated informa-
tion was developed by Hashimoto et al. (2011). It
contains 67 thousand words in 249 blog articles. Al-
though it is not a small scale corpus, it developed
a certain standard for preparing corpora, especially
blog corpora for sentiment and affect-related stud-
ies in Japan. The corpus contains all relevant gram-
matical annotations, including POS tagging, depen-
dency parsing or Named Entity Recognition. It also
contains sentiment-related information. Words and
phrases expressing emotional attitude were anno-
tated by laypeople as either positive or negative.
One disadvantage of the corpus, apart from its small
scale, is the way it was created. Eighty one students
were employed to write blogs about different topics
especially for the need of this research. It could be
argued that since the students knew their blogs will
be read mostly by their teachers, they selected their
words more carefully than they would in private.
Aman and Szpakowicz (2007) constructed a
small-scale English blog corpus. They did not in-
clude any grammatical information, but focused on
affect-related annotations. As an interesting remark,
they were some of the first to recognize the task
of distinguishing between emotive and non-emotive
sentences. This problem is usually one of the most
difficult in text-based Affect Analysis and is there-
fore often omitted in such research. In our research
we applied a system proved to deal with this task
with high accuracy for Japanese.
Das and Bandyopadhyay (2010) constructed an
emotion annotated corpus of blogs in Bengali. The
corpus contains 12,149 sentences within 123 blog
posts extracted from Bengali web blog archive
(http://www.amarblog.com/). It is annotated with
face recognition annotation standard (Ekman, 1992).
Matsumoto et al. (2011) created Wakamono Ko-
toba (Slang of the Youth) corpus. It contains un-
related sentences extracted manually from Yahoo!
blogs (http://blog-search.yahoo.co.jp/). Each sen-

tence contains at least one word from a slang lexicon
and one word from an emotion lexicon, with addi-
tional emotion class tags added per sentence. The
emotion class set used for annotation was chosen
subjectively, by applying the 6 class face recogni-
tion standard and adding 3 classes of their choice.
Mishne (2005) collected a corpus of English blogs
from LiveJournal (http://www.livejournal.com/)
blogs. The corpus contains 815,494 blog posts,
from which many are annotated with emotions
(moods) by the blog authors themselves. The
LiveJournal service offers an option for its users to
annotate their mood while writing the blog. The
list of 132 moods include words like ?amused?, or
?angry?. The LiveJournal mood annotation standard
offers a rich vocabulary to describe the writer?s
mood. However, this richness has been considered
troublesome to generalize the data in a meaningful
manner (Quan and Ren, 2010).
Finally, Minato et al. (2006) collected a 14,195
word, 1,191 sentence corpus. The corpus was a col-
lection of sentence examples from a dictionary of
emotional expressions (Hiejima, 1995). The dictio-
nary was created for the need of Japanese language
learners. Differently to the dictionary applied in our
research (Nakamura, 1993), in Hiejima (1995) sen-
tence examples were mostly written by the author of
the dictionary himself. The dictionary also does not
propose any coherent emotion class list, but rather
the emotion concepts are chosen subjectively. Al-
though the corpus by Minato et al. is the smallest
of all mentioned above, its statistics is described in
detail. Therefore in this paper we use it as one of the
Japanese emotion corpora to compare our work to.
All of the above corpora were annotated manu-
ally or semi-automatically. In this research we per-
formed the first attempt to annotate a large scale blog
corpus (YACIS) with affective information fully au-
tomatically. We did this with systems based on pos-
itively evaluated affect annotation schema, perfor-
mance, and standardized emotion class typology.
3 Choice of Blog Corpus
Although Japanese is a well recognized and de-
scribed world language, there have been only few
large corpora for this language. For example, Er-
javec et al. (2008) gathered a 400-million-word scale
Web corpus JpWaC, or Baroni and Ueyama (2006)
developed a medium-sized corpus of Japanese blogs
jBlogs containing 62 million words. However, both
research faced several problems, such as character
encoding, or web page metadata extraction, such as
the page title or author which differ between do-
mains. Apart from the above mentioned medium
sized corpora at present the largest Web based blog
corpus available for Japanese is YACIS or Yet
Another Corpus of Internet Sentences. We chose
this corpus for the annotation of affective informa-
tion for several reasons. It was collected automati-
cally by Maciejewski et al. (2010) from the pages of
Ameba blog service. It contains 5.6 billion words
within 350 million sentences. Maciejewski et al.
were able to extract only pages containing Japanese
posts (pages with legal disclaimers or written in lan-
guages other than Japanese were omitted). In the
initial phase they provided their crawler, optimized
to crawl only Ameba blog service, with 1000 links

taken from Google (response to one simple query:
?site:ameblo.jp?). They saved all pages to disk as
raw HTML files (each page in a separate file) and
afterward extracted all the posts and comments and
divided them into sentences. The original structure
(blog post and comments) was preserved, thanks to
which semantic relations between posts and com-
ments were retained. The blog service from which
the corpus was extracted (Ameba) is encoded by de-
fault in Unicode, thus there was no problem with
character encoding. It also has a clear and stable
HTML meta-structure, thanks to which they man-
aged to extract metadata such as blog title and au-
thor. The corpus was first presented as an unanno-
tated corpus. Recently Ptaszynski et al. (2012b) an-
notated it with syntactic information, such as POS,
dependency structure or named entity recognition.
An example of the original blog structure in XML
is represented in Figure 1. Some statistics about the
corpus are represented in Table 2.
4 Affective Information Annotation Tools
Emotive Expression Dictionary (Nakamura, 1993)
is a collection of over two thousand expressions de-
scribing emotional states collected manually from a
wide range of literature. It is not a tool per se, but

was converted into an emotive expression database
by Ptaszynski et al. (2009c). Since YACIS is a
Japanese language corpus, for the affect annotation
we needed the most appropriate lexicon for the lan-
guage. The dictionary, developed for over 20 years
by Akira Nakamura, is a state-of-the art example
of a hand-crafted emotive expression lexicon. It
also proposes a classification of emotions that re-
flects the Japanese culture: ki/yorokobi5 (joy),
do?/ikari (anger), ai/aware (sorrow, sadness,
gloom), fu/kowagari (fear), chi/haji (shame,
shyness), ko?/suki (fondness), en/iya (dislike),
ko?/takaburi (excitement), an/yasuragi (relief),
and kyo?/odoroki (surprise). All expressions in the
dictionary are annotated with one emotion class or
more if applicable. The distribution of expressions
across all emotion classes is represented in Table 3.
ML-Ask (Ptaszynski et al., 2009a; Ptaszynski et al.,
2009c) is a keyword-based language-dependent sys-
tem for affect annotation on sentences in Japanese.
It uses a two-step procedure: 1) specifying whether
an utterance is emotive, and 2) annotating the partic-
ular emotion classes in utterances described as emo-
tive. The emotive sentences are detected on the ba-
sis of emotemes, emotive features like: interjections,
mimetic expressions, vulgar language, emoticons

CAO 97.6% 80.2% 94.6%
ML-Ask+CAO 100.0% 89.9% 97.5%
and emotive markers. The examples in Japanese
are respectively: sugee (great!), wakuwaku (heart
pounding), -yagaru (syntactic morpheme used in
verb vulgarization), (? ?) (emoticon expressing joy)
and ?!?, ???? (markers indicating emotive engage-
ment). Emotion class annotation is based on Naka-
mura?s dictionary. ML-Ask is also the only present
system for Japanese recognized to implement the
idea of Contextual Valence Shifters (CVS) (Zaenen
and Polanyi, 2005) (words and phrases like ?not?,
or ?never?, which change the valence of an evalua-
tive word). The last distinguishable feature of ML-
Ask is implementation of Russell?s two dimensional
affect model (Russell, 1980), in which emotions
are represented in two dimensions: valence (posi-
tive/negative) and activation (activated/deactivated).
An example of negative-activated emotion could
be ?anger?; a positive-deactivated emotion is, e.g.,
?relief?. The mapping of Nakamura?s emotion
classes on Russell?s two dimensions was proved re-
liable in several research (Ptaszynski et al., 2009b;
Ptaszynski et al., 2009c; Ptaszynski et al., 2010b).
With these settings ML-Ask detects emotive sen-
tences with a high accuracy (90%) and annotates af-
fect on utterances with a sufficiently high Precision
(85.7%), but low Recall (54.7%). Although low Re-
call is a disadvantage, we assumed that in a corpus
as big as YACIS there should still be plenty of data.
CAO (Ptaszynski et al., 2010b) is a system for
affect analysis of Japanese emoticons, called kao-
moji. Emoticons are sets of symbols used to con-
vey emotions in text-based online communication,
such as blogs. CAO extracts emoticons from in-
put and determines specific emotions expressed by
them. Firstly, it matches the input to a predeter-
mined raw emoticon database (with over ten thou-
sand emoticons). The emoticons, which could not be
estimated with this database are divided into seman-
tic areas (representations of ?mouth? or ?eyes?). The
areas are automatically annotated according to their

co-occurrence in the database. The performance of
CAO was evaluated as close to ideal (Ptaszynski et
al., 2010b) (over 97%). In this research we used
CAO as a supporting procedure in ML-Ask to im-
prove the overall performance and add detailed in-
formation about emoticons.
5 Annotation Results and Evaluation
It is physically impossible to manually evaluate all
annotations on the corpus6. Therefore we applied
three different types of evaluation. First was based
on a sample of 1000 sentences randomly extracted
from the corpus and annotated by laypeople. In sec-
ond we compared YACIS annotations to other emo-
tion corpora. The third evaluation was application
based and is be described in section 6.
Evaluation of Affective Annotations: Firstly, we
needed to confirm the performance of affect anal-
ysis systems on YACIS, since the performance is
often related to the type of test set used in evalu-
ation. ML-Ask was positively evaluated on sepa-
rate sentences and on an online forum (Ptaszynski
et al., 2009c). However, it was not yet evaluated
on blogs. Moreover, the version of ML-Ask sup-
ported by CAO has not been evaluated thoroughly
as well. In the evaluation we used a test set cre-
ated by Ptaszynski et al. (2010b) for the evaluation
of CAO. It consists of thousand sentences randomly
extracted from YACIS and manually annotated with
emotion classes by 42 layperson annotators in an
anonymous survey. There are 418 emotive and 582
non-emotive sentences. We compared the results
on those sentences for ML-Ask, CAO (described in
detail by Ptaszynski et al. (2010b)), and both sys-
tems combined. The results showing accuracy, cal-

would need 11.2 years to verify the whole corpus (354 mil.s.).

culated as a ratio of success to the overall number
of samples, are summarized in Table 4. The perfor-
mance of discrimination between emotive and non-
emotive sentences of ML-Ask baseline was a high
98.8%, which is much higher than in original eval-
uation of ML-Ask (around 90%). This could indi-
cate that sentences with which the system was not
able to deal with appear much less frequently on
Ameblo. As for CAO, it is capable of detecting the
presence of emoticons in a sentence, which is par-
tially equivalent to detecting emotive sentences in
ML-Ask, since emoticons are one type of features
determining sentence as emotive. The performance
of CAO was also high, 97.6%. This was due to the
fact that grand majority of emotive sentences con-
tained emoticons. Finally, ML-Ask supported with
CAO achieved remarkable 100% accuracy. This was
a surprisingly good result, although it must be re-
membered that the test sample contained only 1000
sentences (less than 0.0003% of the whole corpus).
Next we verified emotion class annotations on sen-
tences. The baseline of ML-Ask achieved slightly
better results (73.4%) than in its primary evalua-
tion (Ptaszynski et al., 2009c) (67% of balanced F-
score with P=85.7% and R=54.7%). CAO achieved
80.2%. Interestingly, this makes CAO a better affect
analysis system than ML-Ask. However, the condi-
tion is that a sentence must contain an emoticon. The
best result, close to 90%, was achieved by ML-Ask
supported with CAO. We also checked the results
when only the dimensions of valence and activation
were taken into account. ML-Ask achieved 88.6%,
CAO nearly 95%. Support of CAO toML-Ask again
resulted in the best score, 97.5%.
Statistics of Affective Annotations: There were
nearly twice as many emotive sentences than non-
emotive (ratio 1.94). This suggests that the cor-
pus is biased in favor of emotive contents, which
could be considered as a proof for the assumption
that blogs make a good base for emotion related re-

search. When it comes to statistics of each emo-
tive feature (emoteme), the most frequent class were
interjections. Second frequent was the exclamative
marks class, which includes punctuation marks sug-
gesting emotive engagement (such as ?!?, or ????).
Third frequent emoteme class was emoticons, fol-
lowed by endearments. As an interesting remark,
emoteme class that was the least frequent were vul-
garities. As one possible interpretation of this re-
sult we propose the following. Blogs are social
space, where people describe their experiences to
be read and commented by other people (friends,
colleagues). The use of vulgar language could dis-
courage potential readers from further reading, mak-
ing the blog less popular. Next, we checked the
statistics of emotion classes annotated on emotive
sentences. The results are represented in Table 6.
The most frequent emotions were joy (31%), dislike
(20%) and fondness (19%), which covered over 70%
of all annotations. However, it could happen that
the number of expressions included in each emotion
class database influenced the number of annotations
(database containing many expressions has higher
probability to gather more annotations). Therefore
we verified if there was a correlation between the
number of annotations and the number of emotive
expressions in each emotion class database. The
verification was based on Spearman?s rank corre-
lation test between the two sets of numbers. The
test revealed no statistically significant correlation
between the two types of data, with ?=0.38.
Comparison with Other Emotion Corpora:
Firstly, we compared YACIS with KNB. The KNB
corpus was annotated mostly for the need of sen-
timent analysis and therefore does not contain any

information on specific emotion classes. However,
it is annotated with emotion valence for different
categories valence is expressed in Japanese, such
as emotional attitude (e.g., ?to feel sad about X?
[NEG], ?to like X? [POS]), opinion (e.g., ?X is won-
derful? [POS]), or positive/negative event (e.g., ?X
broke down? [NEG], ?X was awarded? [POS]). We
compared the ratios of sentences expressing posi-
tive to negative valence. The comparison was made
for all KNB valence categories separately and as a
sum. In our research we do not make additional sub-
categorization of valence types, but used in the com-
parison ratios of sentences in which the expressed
emotions were of only positive/negative valence and
including the sentences which were mostly (in ma-
jority) positive/negative. The comparison is pre-
sented in table 7. In KNB for all valence categories
except one the ratio of positive to negative sentences
was biased in favor of positive sentences. Moreover,
for most cases, including the ratio taken from the
sums of sentences, the ratio was similar to the one in
YACIS (around 1.7). Although the numbers of com-
pared sentences differ greatly, the fact that the ratio
remains similar across the two different corpora sug-
gests that the Japanese express in blogs more posi-
tive than negative emotions.
Next, we compared the corpus created by Minato
et al. (2006). This corpus was prepared on the ba-
sis of an emotive expression dictionary. Therefore
we compared its statistics not only to YACIS, but
also to the emotive lexicon used in our research (see
section 4 for details). Emotion classes used in Mi-
nato et al. differ slightly to those used in our re-
search (YACIS and Nakamura?s dictionary). For
example, they use class name ?hate? to describe
what in YACIS is called ?dislike?. Moreover, they
have no classes such as excitement, relief or shame.
To make the comparison possible we used only the
emotion classes appearing in both cases and unified
all class names. The results are summarized in Ta-
ble 8. There was no correlation between YACIS and
Nakamura (?=0.25), which confirms the results cal-
culated in previous paragraph. A medium correla-
tion was observed between YACIS and Minato et al.
(?=0.63). Finally, a strong correlation was observed
between Minato et al. and Nakamura (?=0.88),
which is the most interesting observation. Both Mi-
nato et al. and Nakamura are in fact dictionaries of
emotive expressions. However, the dictionaries were
collected in different times (difference of about 20
years), by people with different background (lexi-
cographer vs. language teacher), based on differ-
ent data (literature vs. conversation) assumptions
and goals (creating a lexicon vs. Japanese language
teaching). The only similarity is in the methodol-
ogy. In both cases the dictionary authors collected
expressions considered to be emotion-related. The
fact that they correlate so strongly suggests that for
the compared emotion classes there could be a ten-
dency in language to create more expressions to de-
scribe some emotions rather than the others (dislike,
joy and fondness are often some of the most frequent
emotion classes). This phenomenon needs to be ver-
ified more thoroughly in the future.
6 Applications
6.1 Extraction of Evaluation Datasets
In evaluation of sentiment and affect analysis sys-
tems it is very important to provide a statistically
reliable random sample of sentences or documents
as a test set (to be further annotated by laypeople).
The larger is the source, the more statistically reli-
able is the test set. Since YACIS contains 354 mil.
sentences in 13 mil. documents, it can be considered
sufficiently reliable for the task of test set extraction,
as probability of extracting twice the same sentence
is close to zero. Ptaszynski et al. (2010b) already
used YACIS to randomly extract a 1000 sentence
sample and used it in their evaluation of emoticon
analysis system. The sample was also used in this
research and is described in more detail in section 5.

6.2 Generation of Emotion Object Ontology
One of the applications of large corpora is to
extract from them smaller sub-corpora for specified
tasks. Ptaszynski et al. (2012a) applied YACIS
for their task of generating an robust emotion
object ontology. They used cross-reference of
annotations of emotional information described
in this paper and syntactic annotations done
by Ptaszynski et al. (2012b) to extract only
sentences in which expression of emotion was
proceeded by its cause, like in the example below.
Kanojo ni furareta kara kanashii...
Girlfriend DAT dump PAS CAUS sad ...
I?m sad becausemy girlfriend dumped me...
The example can be analyzed in the following way.
Emotive expression (kanashii, ?sad?) is related with
the sentence contents (Kanojo ni furareta, ?my
girlfriend dumped me?) with a causality morpheme
(kara, ?because?). In such situation the sentence
contents represent the object of emotion. This can
be generalized to the following meta-structure,
OE CAUS XE ,
where OE=[Emotion object], CAUS=[causal
form], and XE=[expression of emotion].
The cause phrases were cleaned of irrelevant
words like stop words to leave only the object
phrases. The evaluation showed they were able to
extract nearly 20 mil. object phrases, from which
80% was extracted correctly with a reliable signifi-
cance. Thanks to rich annotations on YACIS corpus
the ontology included such features as emotion class
(joy, anger, etc.), dimensions (valence/activation),
POS or semantic categories (hypernyms, etc.).
6.3 Retrieval of Moral Consequence of Actions
Third application of the YACIS corpus annotated
with affect- and sentiment-related information has
been in a novel research on retrieval of moral con-
sequences of actions, first proposed by Rzepka and
Araki (2005) and recently developed by Komuda et
al. (2010)7. The moral consequence retrieval agent
was based on the idea of Wisdom of Crowd. In
particular Komuda et al. (2010) used a Web-mining

Anderson (2010).
technique to gather consequences of actions apply-
ing causality relations, like in the research described
in section 6.2, but with a reversed algorithm and
lexicon containing not only emotional but also eth-
ical notions. They cross-referenced emotional and
ethical information about a certain phrase (such as
?To kill a person.?) to obtain statistical probability
for emotional (?feeling sad?, ?being in joy?, etc.)
and ethical consequences (?being punished?, ?being
praised?, etc.). Initially, the moral agent was based
on the whole Internet contents. However, multiple
queries to search engine APIs made by the agent
caused constant blocking of IP address an in effect
hindered the development of the agent.
The agent was tested on over 100 ethically-
significant real world problems, such as ?killing a
man?, ?stealing money?, ?bribing someone?, ?help-
ing people? or ?saving environment?. In result 86%
of recognitions were correct. Some examples of the
results are presented in the Appendix on the end of
this paper.
7 Conclusions
We performed automatic annotation of a five-
billion-word corpus of Japanese blogs with informa-
tion on affect and sentiment. A survey in emotion
blog corpora showed there has been no large scale
emotion corpus available for the Japanese language.
We chose YACIS, a large-scale blog corpus and
annotated it using two systems for affect analysis
for word- and sentence-level affect analysis and for
analysis of emoticons. The annotated information
included affective features like sentence subjectivity
(emotive/non-emotive) or emotion classes (joy, sad-
ness, etc.), useful in affect analysis and information
on sentence valence/polarity (positive/negative) use-
ful in sentiment analysis obtained as generalizations
of those features on a 2-dimensional model of af-
fect. We evaluated the annotations in several ways.
Firstly, on a test set of thousand sentences extracted
and evaluated by over forty respondents. Secondly,
we compared the statistics of annotations to other
existing emotion corpora. Finally, we showed sev-
eral tasks the corpus has already been applied in,
such as generation of emotion object ontology or re-
trieval of emotional and moral consequences of ac-
tions.
