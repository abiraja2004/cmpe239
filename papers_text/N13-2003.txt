Abstract
In this paper we propose an automatic term
extraction approach that uses machine learn-
ing incorporating varied and rich features of
candidate terms. In our preliminary experi-
ments, we also tested different attribute se-
lection methods to verify which features are
more relevant for automatic term extraction.
We achieved state of the art results for uni-
gram extraction in Brazilian Portuguese.
1 Introduction
Terms are terminological units from specialised
texts (Castellv?? et al, 2001). A term may be: (i) sim-
ple1 (a single element), such as ?biodiversity?, or (ii)
complex (more than one element), such as ?aquatic
ecosystem? and ?natural resource management?.
Automatic term extraction (ATE) methods aim to
identify terminological units in specific domain cor-
pora (Castellv?? et al, 2001). Such information is ex-
tremely useful for several tasks, from the linguistic
perspective of building dictionaries, taxonomies and
ontologies, to computational applications as infor-
mation retrieval, extraction, and summarisation.
Although ATE has been researched for more than
20 years, there is still room for improvement. There
are four major ATE problems. The first one is that
the ATE approaches may extract terms that are not
actual terms (?noise?) or do not extract actual terms
(?silence?). Considering the ecology domain, an ex-
ample of silence is when a term (e.g., pollination),
?This research was supported by FAPESP (Proc. No.
2009/16142-3 and 2012/09375-4), Brazil.

with low frequency, is not considered a candidate
term (CT), and, therefore, it will not appear in the
extracted term list if we consider its frequency. Re-
garding noise, if we consider that nouns may be
terms and that adjectives may not, if an adjective
(e.g., ecological) is mistakenly tagged as a noun, it
will be wrongly extracted as a term. The second
problem is the difficulty in dealing with extremely
high number of candidates (called the high dimen-
sionality of candidate representation) that requires
time to process them. Since the ATE approaches ge-
nerate large lists of TCs, we have the third problem
that is the time and human effort spent for validat-
ing the TCs, which usually is manually performed.
The fourth problem is that the results are still not sa-
tisfactory and there is a natural ATE challenge since
the difficulty in obtaining a consensus among the ex-
perts about which words are terms of a specific do-
main (Vivaldi and Rodr??guez, 2007).
Our proposed ATE approach uses machine learn-
ing (ML), since it has been achieving high precision
values (Zhang et al, 2008; Foo and Merkel, 2010;
Zhang et al, 2010; Loukachevitch, 2012). Although
ML may also generate noise and silence, it facili-
tates the use of a large number of TCs and their fea-
tures, since ML techniques learn by themselves how
to recognize a term and then they save time extract-
ing them.
Our approach differs from others because we
adopt a rich feature set using varied knowledge lev-
els. With this, it is possible to decrease the silence
and noise and, consequently, to improve the ATE
results. Our features range from simple statistical
(e.g., term frequency) and linguistic (e.g., part of
16
speech - POS) knowledge to more sophisticated hy-
brid knowledge, such as the analysis of the term
context. As far as we know, the combined use of
this specific knowledge has not been applied before.
Another difference is that we apply 3 statistical fea-
tures (Term Variance (Liu et al, 2005), Term Vari-
ance Quality (Dhillon et al, 2003), and Term Con-
tribution (Liu et al, 2003)) that to date have only
been used for attribute selection and not for term ex-
traction. As far as we know, the combined use of
this specific knowledge and feature feedback has not
been applied before. We also propose 4 new linguis-
tic features for ATE. All these features are detailed in
Section 4. Finally, for the first time, ML is being ap-
plied in the task of ATE in Brazilian Portuguese (BP)
corpora. Our approach may also be easily adapted to
other languages.
We focus on extracting only unigram terms, since
this is already a complex task. We run our experi-
ments on 3 different corpora. Our main contribution
is the improvement of precision (in the best case, we
improve the results 11 times) and F-measure (in the
best case, we improve 2 times).
Section 2 presents the main related work. Section
3 describes our ATE approach. Section 4 details the
experiments, and Section 5 reports the results. Con-
clusions and future work are presented in Section 6.
2 Related Work
There are several recent and interesting studies that
are not focused on extracting unigrams (Estopa` et
al., 2000; Almeida and Vale, 2008; Zhang et al,
2008; Zhang et al, 2010; Nazar, 2011; Vivaldi et al,
2012; Lopes, 2012). Normally, ATE studies use cor-
pora of different domain and language and, in some
cases, the authors use different evaluation measures.
Regardless of variation (e.g., the size of the test cor-
pora), we mention studies that have highlighted re-
sults for unigrams2. When possible, we show the
best precision (P) of the related work and its recall
(R).
(Ventura and Silva, 2008) extracted terms using
statistical measures that consider the predecessors
and successors of TCs. They achieved, for English,
P=81.5% and R=55.4% and, for Spanish, P=78.2%

complex terms.
and R=60.8%. For Spanish, the Greek forms of a
candidate and their prefix may help to extract terms
(e.g., the Greek formant laring that belongs to the
term laringoespasm in the medical domain) (Vivaldi
and Rodr??guez, 2007), achieving about P=55.4%
and R=58.1%. For Spanish, (Gelbukh et al, 2010)
compared TCs of a domain with words of a general
corpus using Likelihood ratio based distance. They
achieved P=92.5%. For Brazilian Portuguese, the
ExPorTer methods are the only previous work that
uniquely extract unigrams (Zavaglia et al, 2007).
Therefore, they are the state of the art for unigrams
extraction for BP. The linguistic ExPorTer consid-
ers terms that belong to some POS patterns and uses
indicative phrases (such as is defined as) that may
identify where terms are. It achieved P=2.74% and
R=89.18%. The hybrid ExPorTer used these lin-
guistic features with frequency and Likelihood ratio.
The latter one obtained P=12.76% and R=23.25%.
3 Term Extraction Approach based on
Machine Learning
In order to model the ATE task as a machine learn-
ing solution, we consider each word in the input
texts3 of a specific domain (except the stopwords)
as a learning instance (candidate term). For each in-
stance, we identify a set of features over which the
classification is performed. The classification pre-
dicts which words are terms (unigrams) of a specific
domain. We test different attribute selection meth-
ods in order to verify which features are more rele-
vant to classify a term.
We start by preprocessing the input texts, as
shown in Figure 1. This step consists of POS tag-
ging the corpora and normalizing4 the words of the
texts. The normalization minimizes the second ATE
problem because it allows working with a lower CT
representation dimensionality. When working with
a lower dimensionality, the words that do not help
identify terms are eliminated. Consequently, fewer
candidates should to be validated or refuted as terms
(it would minimize the third ATE problem). When
working with fewer candidates it also may improve
the result quality (it handles the fourth ATE prob-

ducing their variations.
17
lem), and, definitely, it spends less time and fewer
resources to carry out the experiments. By improv-
ing the results, consequently, we minimize silence
and noise, which handles the first ATE problem.
Afterwards, we remove stopwords.
In order to identify a set of features over which
the classification is performed, we studied and tested
several measures. The feature identification is the
most important step of our approach. We divide the
features into two types: (i) the features that obtain
statistical, linguistic, and hybrid knowledge from the
input corpus, such as TFIDF and POS, and (ii) the
features that obtain these knowledge from measures
that use other corpora besides the input corpus. The
corpora belong to another domain that is different of
the input corpus domain (called contrastive corpora)
or not belong to any specific domain (called general
corpora). Our hypothesis is that, with the joining of
features of different levels of knowledge, it is possi-
ble to improve the ATE.
Figure 1: Term extraction approach proposed.
4 Experimental Setup
At this point, for obtaining the knowledge in order
to extract terms, we tested 17 features that do not
depend on general or contrastive corpora and 2 fea-
tures that depend on these corpora. We intend to
explore more features (and we will possibly propose
new measures) that use contrastive or general cor-
pora or any taxonomic structure. The experiments
that expand the number of features are ongoing now.
We used 3 corpora of different domains in the
Portuguese language. The EaD corpus (Souza and
Di Felippo, 2010) has 347 texts about distance edu-
cation and has a gold standard with 118 terms5 (Gi-
5(Gianoti and Di Felippo, 2011) stated that the EaD unigram
gold standard has 59 terms, but in this paper we used 118 uni-
grams that the authors provided us prior to their work.
anoti and Di Felippo, 2011). The second one is the
ECO6 corpus (Zavaglia et al, 2007). It contains 390
texts of ecology domain and its gold standard has
322 unigrams. The latter is the Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology (N&N) corpus (Coleti et al, 2008)
that contains 1,057 texts. Its gold standard has 1,794
unigrams (Coleti et al, 2008; Coleti et al, 2009).
In order to preprocess these corpora, we POS
tagged them using the PALAVRAS parser (Bick,
2000) and normalized their words using a stem-
ming7 technique. Stemming was chosen because of
its capacity to group similar word meanings, and its
use decreases representation dimensionality of can-
didate terms, which minimizes the second and third
ATE problems. Afterwards, we removed the stop-
words8, the conjugation of the verb ?to be?, punctu-
ation, numbers, accents, and the words composed of
only one character are removed.
We identify and calculate 19 features in which 11
features are used for ATE in the literature, 3 features
are normally applied to the attribute selection tasks
(identified by *), 1 normally used for Named Entity
Recognition (identified by **), and we created 4 new
features (identified by ?). These features are shown
in Table 1, accompanied by the hypotheses that un-
derlie their use. They are also divided into 3 levels
of knowledge: statistical, linguistic, and hybrid.
For the S feature, we removed stopwords at the
beginning and at the end of these phrases. For
POS, we assumed that terms may also be adjectives
(Almeida and Vale, 2008), besides nouns and verbs.
For GC and Freq GC, we used the NILC Corpus9 as
a general corpus, which contains 40 million words.
We created and used 40 indicative phrases (NPs).
For example, considering are composed of as an IP
in All organisms are composed of one or more cells,
we would consider organisms and cells as TCs. For
features related to CT stem, we analyzed, e.g., the
words educative, educators, education and educate
that came from the stem educ. Therefore, educ may

Feature Description Hypothesis
The eight linguistic features
S noun and prepositional phrases terms are noun phrases and, sometimes, prepositional phrases
N S head of phrases heads of noun and prepositional phrases
POS noun, proper noun, and adjective terms follow some patterns
IP indicative phrases IPs may identify definitions/descriptions that may be terms
N noun ? number of nouns
N adj ? number of adjectives stemmed terms come from
N verb ? number of verbs higher number of nouns
N PO ? total of words from which stemmed TCs come from than adjectives or verbs
The seven statistical features
SG** n-gram length each domain has a term pattern
TF Term Frequency terms have neither low nor very high frequencies
DF Document Frequency terms appear in at least certain number of documents
TFIDF Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency terms are very common in the corpus(Salton and Buckley, 1987) but they occur in few documents in this corpus
TCo* Term Contribution (Liu et al, 2003) terms help to distinguish the different documents
TV* Term Variance (Liu et al, 2005) terms do not have low frequency in documents and maintain a
TVQ* Term Variance Quality (Dhillon et al, 2003) non-uniform distribution throughout corpus (higher variance)
The four hybrid features
GC CT occurrence in general corpus terms do not occur with high frequency in a general corpusFreq GC CT frequency in GC
C-value the potential of a CT to be a term (Frantzi et al, 1998) the C-value helps to extract terms
NC-value CT context (Frantzi et al, 1998) candidate context helps to extract terms
have as features N Noun = 2 (educators and educa-
tion), N Adj = 1 educative, N Verb = 1 (educate),
and N PO = 4 (total number of words). Our hy-
pothesis is that stemmed candidates that were origi-
nated from a higher number of nouns than adjectives
or verbs will be terms. Finally, we used NC-Value
adapted to unigrams (Barro?n-Ceden?o et al, 2009).
After calculating the features for each unigram
(candidate term), the CT representation has high di-
mensionality (it is the second ATE problem) and,
hence, the experiments may take a considerable
amount of time to be executed. To decrease this di-
mensionality and, consequently, the number of TCs
(which corresponds to the second and third ATE
problems, respectively), we tested two different cut-
offs, which preserve only TCs that occur in at least
two documents in the corpus. The first cut-off is
called C1. In the second one (called C2), the can-
didates must be noun and prepositional phrases and
also follow some of these POS: nouns, proper nouns,
verbs, and adjectives. The number of obtained can-
didates (stems) was 10,524, 14,385, and 46,203,
for the ECO, EaD, and N&N corpora, respectively.
When using the C1 cut-off, we decreased to 55,15%,
45,82%, and 57,04%, and C2 decreased 63.10%,
63.18%, 66.94% in relation to the number of all the
obtained candidates (without cutt-offs).
5 Experimental Evaluation and Results
The first evaluation aimed to identify which fea-
tures must be used for ATE (see Section 3). For
that, we applied 2 methods that select attributes by
evaluating the attribute subsets. Their evaluation is
based on consistency (CBF) and correlation (CFS).
We also tested search methods. The combination
of these methods, available in WEKA (Hall et al,
2009), is: CFS SubsetEval using the RankSearch
Filter as search method (CFS R), CFS SubsetEval
using the BestFirst as search method (CFS BF),
CBF SubsetEval using the Ranking Filter (C R),
and CBF SubsetEval using the Greedy Stepwise
(C G). These methods return feature sets that are
considered the most representative for the term clas-
sification (Table 2). For the EaD corpus, the CG at-
tribute selection method did not select any feature.
For our experiments, we also considered all the fea-
tures (referred by All). Additionally, we compared
the use of two cut-off types for each feature set, C1
and C2, detailed in Section 4.
For both evaluations8, we chose largely known
inductors in the machine learning area. They rep-
resent different learning paradigms: JRip (Rule In-
duction), Na??ve Bayes (Probabilistic), J48 (Decision
Tree) with confidence factor of 25%, and SMO (Sta-
tistical Learning). All of these algorithms are avail-

able in WEKA and described in (Witten and Frank,
2005). We run the experiments on a 10 fold cross-
validation and calculated the precision, recall, and
F-measure scores of term classification according to
the gold standard of unigrams of each corpus. Using
default parameter values for SMO, the results were
lower than the other inductors. Due to this fact and
the lack of space in the paper, we do not present the
SMO results here.
The best precision obtained for the EaD corpus
using the term classification, 66.66%, was achieved
by the C R attribute selection method with the C2
cut-off (C R-C2) using the JRIP inductor. The best
recall score, 20.96%, was obtained using Na??ve
Bayes with the CFS R-C1 method. The best F-
measure was 17.58% using the J48 inductor with
C R-C2. For the ECO corpus, the best precision
was 60% obtained with the J48 inductor with con-
fidence factor of 25% and the C R-C1 method. The
best recall was 21.40% with JRIP and the C G-C1
method. Our best F-measure was 24.26% obtained
with Na??ve Bayes using the CFS R-C1 method.
For the N&N corpus, the best precision score was
61.03% using JRIP. The best recall was 52.53% and
the best F-measure score was 54.04%, both using
J48 inductor with confidence factor of 25%. The
three results used the All-C2 method.
Table 3 shows the comparison of our best results
with 2 baselines, which are the well-known term fre-
quency and TFIDF, using our stoplist. We also con-
sidered all the stemmed words of these corpora as
CT, except the stopwords, and we calculated the pre-
cision, recall, and F-measure scores for these words
as well. Finally, we compared our results with the
third baseline, which is the only previous work that
uniquely extracts unigrams (Zavaglia et al, 2007),
described in Section 2. Therefore, this is the state
of the art for unigrams extraction for Portuguese. In
order to compare this work with our results of the
EaD and N&N corpora, we implemented the ATE
method of Zavaglia et al We have to mention that
this method uses the normalization technique called
lemmatization instead of stemming, which we used
in our method. The only difference between our im-
plementation descriptions and the original method is
that we POS tagged and lemmatizated the texts using
the same parser (PALAVRAS10 (Bick, 2000)) used
in our experiments instead of the MXPOST tagger
(Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
For all used corpora, we obtained better results of
precision and F-measure comparing with the base-
lines. In general, we improve the ATE precision
scores, for the EaD corpus, eleven times (from 6.1%
to 66.66%) and, for the N&N corpus, one and a half
times (from 35.4% to 61.03%), both comparing our
results with the use of TFIDF. For the ECO corpus,
we improve four and a half times (from 12.9% to
60%), by comparing with the use of frequency. We
improve the ATE F-measure scores, for the EaD cor-
pus, one and a half times (from 10.93% to 17.58%);
for the ECO corpus, we slightly improve the results
(from 20.64% to 24.26%); and, for the N&N cor-
pus, two times (from 28.12% to 54.04%). The last
three cases are based on the best F-measure values
obtained using TFIDF. Regarding recall, on the one
hand, the linguistic ExPorTer method (detailed in
Section 2), to which we also compare our results,
achieved better recall for all used corpora, about
89%. On the other hand, its precision (about 2%)
and F-measure (about 4%) were significantly lower
than our results.
Finally, if we compare our results with the results
of all stemmed words, with the exception of the stop-
words, the recall values of the latter are high (about
76%) for all used corpora. However, the precision
scores are extremely low (about 1.26%), because it
used almost all words of the texts.
10As all NLP tools for general domains, PALAVRAS is not
excellent for specific domains. However, as it would be expen-
sive (time and manual work) to customize it for each specific
domain that we presented in this paper, we decided use it, even
though there are error tagging.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper described ongoing experiments about
unigrams extraction usingML. Our first contribution
regarding the experiments was to create 4 features
and to test 4 features that normally are applied to
other tasks and not for automatic term extraction.
Our second contribution is related to the first and
fourth ATE problems, which are the existence of si-
lence and noise and low ATE results, respectively.
We achieved state of art results for unigrams in
Brazilian Portuguese. We improved, for all used cor-
pora, precision (in the best case, we improve the re-
sults 11 times using the EaD corpus) and F-measure
(in the best case, 2 times using the N&N corpus)
and, consequently, we minimized silence and noise.
The third contribution is about the features that
are better for extracting domain terms. All the tested
attribute selection methods indicated the TFIDF as
an essential feature for ATE. 90.9% of the meth-
ods selected N Noun and TVQ, and 81.81% selected
TV, IP, N adj, and POS as relevant features. How-
ever, only one of these methods chose Freq GC, and
none of them chose the SG feature. Regarding the
levels of knowledge - statistical, linguistic, and hy-
brid - in which each feature was classified, at least
45.45% of the methods chose 6 statistical, 5 linguis-
tic, and 3 hybrid features. We also observed that the
best F-measures (see Tables 2 and 3) were obtained
when using at least linguistic and statistical features
together. This fact proves that our main hypothesis is
true, because we improved the ATE results by join-
ing features of different levels of knowledge. Addi-
tionally, we allow the user to choose the features that
are better for term extraction.
As the fourth contribution, we minimized the
problem of high dimensionality (as mentioned, the
second ATE problem) by means of the use of two
different cut-offs (C1 and C2). By reducing the
number of TCs, fewer candidates were validated or
refuted as terms and, consequently, we minimized
the third ATE problem, which is the time and human
effort for validating the TCs. However, we still per-
ceived the need to reduce more the number of can-
didates. Therefore, for future work, we intend to use
instance selection techniques to reduce the term rep-
resentation.
We believe to have achieved significant results for
the experiments realized to date. Experiments using
more features that dependent on general corpus are
ongoing. We will also possibly propose new features
and will use taxonomic structure in order to improve
more the results. For using the taxonomic structure,
we intend to create a conventional taxonomy (Mi-
iller and Dorre, 1999) is created using the input cor-
pus. Therefore, we may identify more features for
the instances considering this taxonomy. For exam-
ple, normally in a taxonomy?s leaf specific words
of a domain happen, consequently, terms should ap-
pear there. Additionally, we are encouraged to adapt
these features for bigram and trigram terms as well.
