Abstract
The Right Frontier Constraint (RFC), as a
constraint on the attachment of new con-
stituents to an existing discourse struc-
ture, has important implications for the in-
terpretation of anaphoric elements in dis-
course and for Machine Learning (ML) ap-
proaches to learning discourse structures.
In this paper we provide strong empirical
support for SDRT?s version of RFC. The
analysis of about 100 doubly annotated
documents by five different naive annota-
tors shows that SDRT?s RFC is respected
about 95% of the time. The qualitative
analysis of presumed violations that we
have performed shows that they are either
click-errors or structural misconceptions.
1 Introduction
A cognitively plausible way to view the construc-
tion of a discourse structure for a text is an incre-
mental one. Interpreters integrate discourse con-
stituent n into the antecedently constructed dis-
course structure D for constituents 1 to n ? 1 by
linking n to some constituent in D with a dis-
course relation. SDRT?s Right Frontier Constraint
(RFC) (Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 2003)
says that a new constituent n cannot attach to an
arbitrary node in D. Instead it must attach to ei-
ther the last node entered into the graph or one of
the nodes that dominate this last node. Assuming
that the last node is usually found on the right of
the structure, this means that the nodes available
for attachment occur on the right frontier (RF) of
the discourse graph or SDRS.
Researchers working in different theoretical
paradigms have adopted some form of this con-
straint. Polanyi (1985; 1988) originally pro-
posed the RFC as a constraint on antecedents to
anaphoric pronouns. SDRT generalizes this to a
condition on all anaphoric elements. As the at-
tachment of new information to a contextually
given discourse graph in SDRT involves the reso-
lution of an anaphoric dependency, RFC furnishes
a constraint on the attachment problem. (Webber,
1988; Mann and Thompson, 1987; 1988) have
also adopted versions of this constraint. But there
are important differences. While SDRT and RST
both take RFC as a constraint on all discourse at-
tachments (in DLTAG, in contrast, anaphoric dis-
course particles are not limited to finding an an-
tecedent on the RF), SDRT?s notion of RF is sub-
stantially different from that of RST?s or Polanyi?s,
because SDRT?s notion of a RF depends on a 2-
dimensional discourse graph built from coordinat-
ing and subordinating discourse relations. Defin-
ing RFC with respect to SDRT?s 2-dimensional
graphs allows the RF to contain discourse con-
stituents that do not include the last constituent
entered into the graph (in contrast to RST). SDRT
also allows for multiple attachments of a con-
stituent to the RFC.
SDRT?s RFC has important implications for the
interpretation of various types of anaphoric ele-
ments: tense (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), ellip-
sis (Hardt et al, 2001; Hardt and Romero, 2004;
Asher, 2007), as well as pronouns referring to in-
dividuals and abstract entities (Asher, 1993; Asher
and Lascarides, 2003). The RFC, we believe, will
also benefit ML approaches to learning discourse
structures, as a constraint limiting the search space
for possible discourse attachments. Despite its
importance, SDRT?s RFC has never been empiri-
cally validated, however. We present evidence in
this paper providing strong empirical support for
SDRT?s version of the constraint. We have cho-
sen to study SDRT?s notion of a RF, because of
SDRT?s greater expressive power over RST (Dan-
los, 2008), the greater generality of SDRT?s defi-
1
nition of RFC, and because of SDRT?s greater the-
oretical reliance on the constraint for making se-
mantic predictions. SDRT also makes theoretically
clear why the RFC should apply to discourse re-
lation attachment, since it treats discourse struc-
ture construction as a dynamic process in which
all discourse relations are essentially anaphors.
The analysis of about 100 doubly annotated docu-
ments by five different naive annotators shows that
this constraint, as defined in SDRT, is respected
about 95% of the time. The qualitative analysis of
the presumed violations that we have performed
shows that they are either click-errors or structural
misconceptions by the annotators.
Below, we give a formal definition of SDRT?s
RFC; section 3 explains our annotation procedure.
Details of the statistical analysis we have per-
formed are given in section 4, and a qualitative
analysis is provided in section 5. Finally, sec-
tion 6 presents the implications of the empirical
study for ML techniques for the extraction of dis-
course structures while sections 7 and 8 present
the related work and conclusions.
2 The Right Frontier Constraint in SDRT
In SDRT, a discourse structure or SDRS (Seg-
mented Discourse Representation Structure) is a
tuple < A,F , LAST >, where A is the set of
labels representing the discourse constituents of
the structure, LAST ? A the last introduced label
and F a function which assigns each member of
A a well-formed formula of the SDRS language
(defined (Asher and Lascarides, 2003, p 138)).
SDRSs correspond to ? expressions with a contin-
uation style semantics. SDRT distinguishes coor-
dinating and subordinating discourse relations us-
ing a variety of linguistic tests (Asher and Vieu,
2005),1 and isolates structural relations (Parallel
and Contrast) based on their semantics.
The RF is the set of available attachment points
1The subordinating relations of SDRT are currently: Elab-
oration (a relation defined in terms of the main eventualities
of the related constituents), Entity-Elaboration (E-Elab(a,b)
iff b says more about an entity mentioned in a that is not the
main eventuality of a) Comment, Flashback (the reverse of
Narration), Background, Goal (intentional explanation), Ex-
planation, and Attribution. The coordinating relations are:
Narration, Contrast, Result, Parallel, Continuation, Alterna-
tion, and Conditional, all defined in Asher and Lascarides
(2003).
to which a new utterance can be attached. What
this set includes depends on the discourse relation
used to make the attachment. Here is the defini-
tion from (Asher and Lascarides, 2003, p 148).
Suppose that a constituent ? is to be attached to a
constituent in the SDRS with a discourse relation
other than Parallel or Contrast. Then the avail-
able attachment points for ? are:
1. The label ? = LAST;
2. Any label ? such that:
(a) i-outscopes(?, ?) (i.e. R(?, ?) or
R(?, ?) is a conjunct in F(?) for
some R and some ?); or
(b) R(?, ?) is a conjunct in F(?) for
some label ?, where R is a subordi-
nating discourse relation.
We gloss this as ? < ?.
3. Transitive Closure:
Any label ? that dominates ? through a
sequence of labels ?1, ?2, . . . ?n such that
? < ?1 < ?2 < . . . ?n < ?
We can represent an SDRS as a graph G, whose
nodes are the labels of the SDRSs constituents and
whose typed arcs represent the relations between
them. The nodes available for attachment of a new
element ? in G are the last introduced node LAST
and any other node dominating LAST, where the
notion of domination should be understood as the
transitive closure over the arrows given by sub-
ordinating relations or those holding between a
complex segment and its parts. Subordinating re-
lations like Elaboration extend the vertical dimen-
sion of the graph, whereas coordinating relations
like Narration expand the structure horizontally.
The graph of every SDRS has a unique top label
for the whole structure or formula; however, there
may be multiple < paths defined within a given
SDRS, allowing for multiple parents, in the ter-
minology of (Wolf and Gibson, 2006). Further-
more, SDRT allows for multiple arcs between con-
stituents and attachments to multiple constituents
on the RFC, making for a very rich structure.
SDRT?s RFC is restricted to non-structural rela-
tions, because structural relations postulate a par-
tial isomorphism from the discourse structure of
the second constituent to the discourse structure
of the first, which provides its own attachment
possibilities for subconstituents of the two related
structures (Asher, 1993). Sometimes such paral-
lelism or contrast, also known as discourse subor-
dination (Asher, 1993), can be enforced in a long
2
distance way by repeating the same wording in the
two constituents.
RFC has the name it does because the segments
that belong on this set (the ?s in the above def-
inition) are typically nodes on a discourse graph
which are geometrically placed at the RF of the
graph. Consider the following example embel-
lished from Asher and Lascarides (2003):
(1) (?1) John had a great evening last night. (?2) He first
had a great meal at Michel Sarran. (?3) He ate
profiterolles de foie gras, (?4) which is a specialty of
the chef. (?5) He had the lobster, (?6) which he had
been dreaming about for weeks. (?7) He then went
out to a several swank bars.
The graph of the SDRS for 1 looks like this:
(2) ?1
Elaboration
??
?2
ElaborationNarration
?7
???
?3
E-elabNarration
?5
Background
?4 ?6
where ?? and ??? represent complex segments.
Given that the last introduced utterance is repre-
sented by the node ?7, the set of nodes that are
on the RF are ?7 (LAST), ?? (the complex segment
that includes ?7) and ?1 (connected via a subordi-
nating relation to ??). All those nodes are geomet-
rically placed at the RF of the graph.
SDRT?s notion of a RF is more general than
RST?s or DLTAG?s. First, SDRSs can have com-
plex constituents with multiple elements linked
by coordinate relations that serve as arguments
to other relations, thus permitting instances of
shared structure that are difficult to capture in a
pure tree notation (Lee et al, 2008). In addi-
tion, in RST the RF picks out the adjacent con-
stituents, LAST and complex segments including
LAST. Contrary to RST, SDRT, as it uses 2-
dimensional graphs, predicts that an available at-
tachment point for ?7 is the non local and non ad-
jacent ?2, which is distinct from the complex con-
stituent consisting of ?2 to ?6.2 This difference
is crucial to the interpretation of the Narration:
2The 2-dimensionality of SDRSs also allows us to rep-
Narration claims a sequence of two events; mak-
ing the complex constituent (essentially a sub-
SDRS) an argument of Narration, as RST does,
makes it difficult to recover such an interpreta-
tion. Danlos?s (2008) interpretation of the Nu-
clearity Principle provides an interpretation of the
Narration([2-4],5) that is equivalent to the SDRS
graph above.3 But even an optional Nuclearlity
Principle interpretation won?t help with discourse
structures like (2) where the backgrounding ma-
terial in ?4 and the commentary in ?6 do not and
cannot figure as part of the Elaboration for seman-
tic reasons. In our corpus described below, over
20% of the attachments were non adjacent; i.e. the
attachment point for the new material did not in-
clude LAST.
A further difference between SDRT and other
theories is that, as SDRT?s RFC is applied re-
cursively over complex segments within a given
SDRS, many more attachment points are available
in SDRT. E.g., consider the SDRS for this example,
adapted from (Wolf and Gibson, 2006):
(3) (?1) Mary wanted garlic and thyme. (?2) She also
needed basil. (?3) The recipe called for them. (?4)
The basil would be hard to come by this time of year.

Because ? is the complex segment consisting
of ?1 and ?2, attachment to ? with a subordinat-
ing discourse relation permits attachment ??s open
constituents as well.4
3 Annotated Corpus
Our corpus comes from the discourse structure an-
notation project ANNODIS5 which represents an
on going effort to build a discourse graph bank
for French texts with the two-fold goal of test-
ing various theoretical proposals about discourse
resent many examples with Elaboration that involve cross-
ing dependencies in Wolf and Gibson?s (2006) representation
without violation of the RFC.

ity Principle does not always hold.

carides, 2003).

structure and providing a seed corpus for learning
discourse structures using ML techniques. ANN-
ODIS?s annotation manual provides detailed in-
structions about the segmentation of a text into
Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs). EDUs corre-
spond often to clauses but are also introduced by
frame adverbials,6 appositive elements, correla-
tive constructions ([the more you work,] [the more
you earn]), interjections and discourse markers
within coordinated VPs [John denied the charges]
[but then later admitted his guilt]. Appositive ele-
ments often introduce embedded EDUs; e.g., [Jim
Powers, [President of the University of Texas at
Austin], resigned today.], which makes our seg-
mentation more fine-grained than Wolf and Gib-
son?s (2006) or annotation schemes for RST or the
PDTB.
The manual also details the meaning of dis-
course relations but says nothing about the struc-
tural postulates of SDRT. For example, there is no
mention of the RFC in the manual and very little
about hierarchical structure. Subjects were told
to put whatever discourse relations from our list
above between constituents they felt were appro-
priate. They were also told that they could group
constituents together whenever they felt that as a
whole they jointly formed the term of a discourse
relation. We purposely avoided making the man-
ual too restrictive, because one of our goals was
to examine how well SDRT predicts the discourse
structure of subjects who have little knowledge of
discourse theories.
In total 5 subjects with little to no knowledge
of discourse theories that use RFC participated
in the annotation campaign. Three were under-
graduate linguistics students and two were grad-
uate linguistics students studying different areas.
The 3 undergraduates benefitted from a completed
and revised annotation manual. The two gradu-
ate students did their annotations while the anno-
tation manual was undergoing revisions. All in
all, our annotators doubly annotated about 100
French newspaper texts and Wikipedia articles.
Subjects first segmented each text into EDUs, and
then they were paired off and compared their seg-

mentations, resolving conflicts on their own or via
a supervisor. The annotation of the discourse re-
lations was performed by each subject working
in isolation. ANNODIS provided a new state of
the art tool, GLOZZ, for discourse annotation for
the three undergraduates. With GLOZZ annotators
could isolate sections of text corresponding to sev-
eral EDUs, and insert relations between selected
constituents using the mouse. Though it did por-
tray relations selected as lines between parts of the
text, GLOZZ did not provide a discourse graph or
SDRS as part of its graphical interface. The rep-
resentation often yielded a dense number of lines
between segments that annotators and evaluators
found hard to read. The inadequate interline spac-
ing in GLOZZ also contributed to certain number
of click errors that we detail below in the paper.

and relations provided by each annotator are in ta-

4 Experiments and Results
Using ANNODIS?s annotated corpus, we checked
for all EDUs ?, whether ? was attached to a con-
stituent in the SDRS built from the previous EDUs
in a way that violated the RFC. Given a discourse
as a series of EDUs ?1, ?2, . . . , ?n, we constructed
for each ?i the corresponding sub-graph and cal-
culated the set of nodes on the RF of this sub-
graph. We then checked whether the EDU ?i+1
was attached to a node that was found in this set.
We also checked whether any newly created com-
plex segment was attached to a node on the RF of
this sub-graph.
4.1 Calculating the Nodes at the RF
To calculate the nodes on the RF, we slightly ex-
tended the annotated graphs, in order to add im-
4
plied relations left out by the annotators.7
Disconnected Graphs While checking the RFC
for the attachment of a node n, the SDRS graph
at this point might consist of 2 or more disjoint
subgraphs which get connected together at a later
point. Because we did not want to decide which
way these graphs should be connected, we defined
a right frontier for each one using its own LAST.
We then calculated the RF for each one of them
and set the set of available nodes to be those in
the union of the RFs of the disjoint subgraphs. If
the subgraphs were not connected at the end of
the incremental process in a way that conformed
to RFC, we counted this as a violation. Annotators
did not always provide us with a connected graph.
Postponed Decisions SDRT allows for the at-
tachment not only of EDUs but also of subgraphs
to an available node in the contextually given
SDRS. For instance, in the following example, the
intended meaning is given by the graph in which
the Contrast is between the first label and the com-
plex constituent composed of the disjunction of ?2
and ?3.
(?1) Bill doesn?t like sports. (?2) But Sam does.
(?3) Or John does.
?1 Contrast ?
?
?2 Altern. ?3
Naive annotators attached subgraphs instead of
EDUs to the RF with some regularity (around 2%).
This means that an EDU ?i+1 could be attached to
a node that was not present in the subgraph pro-
duced by ?1, . . . , ?i. There were two main rea-
sons for this: (1) ?i+1 came from a syntactically
fronted clause, a parenthetical or apposition in a
sentence whose main clause produced ?i+2 and
?i+1 was attached to ?i+2; (2) ?i+1 was attached
to a complex segment [. . . , ?i+1, . . . , ?i+k, . . .]
which was not yet introduced in the subgraph.
Since the nodes to which ?i+1 is attached in
such cases are not present in the graph, by def-
inition they are not in the RF and they could be
counted as violations. Nonetheless, if the nodes
7In similar work on TimeML annotations, Setzer et al
(2003; Muller and Raymonet (2005) add implied relations to
annotated, temporal graphs.
which connect nodes like ?i+1 eventually link up
to the incrementally built SDRS in the right way,
?i+1 might eventually end up linked to something
on the RF. For this reason, we postponed the de-
cision on nodes like ?i+1 until the nodes to which
they are attached were explicitly introduced in the
SDRS.
The Coherence of Complex Segments In an
SDRS, several EDUs may combine to form a com-
plex segment ? that serves as a term for a dis-
course relation R. The interpretation of the SDRS
implies that all of ??s constituents contribute to
the rhetorical function specified by R. This im-
plies that the coordinating relation Continuation
holds between the EDUs inside ?, unless there is
some other relation between them that is incom-
patible with Continuation (like a subordinating
relation). Continuations are often used in SDRT
(Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 2003). Dur-
ing the annotation procedure, our subjects did not
always explicitly link the EDUs within a complex
segment. In order to enforce the coherence of
those complex segments we added Continuation
relations between the constituents of a complex
segment unless there was already another path be-
tween those constituents.
Expanding Continuations Consider the fol-
lowing discourse:
(4) [John, [who owns a chain of restaurants]?2 , [and is a
director of a local charity organization,]?3 wanted to
sell his yacht.]?1 [He couldn?t afford it anymore.]?4
Annotators sometimes produced the following
SDRT graph for the first three EDUs of this dis-
course:
(5) ?1
E-Elab
?2 Continuation ?3
In this case the only open node is ?3 due to
the coordinating relation Continuation. Nonethe-
less, ?4 should be attached to ?1, without vi-
olating the RFC. Indeed, SDRT?s definition of
the Continuation relation enforces that if we have
R(?1, ?2) and Continuation(?2, ?3) then we ac-
tually have the complex segment [?2, ?3] with
R(?1, [?2, ?3]). So there is in fact a missing com-
plex segment in (5). The proper SDRS graph of (4)
is:
5
(6) ?1
E-Elab
?
?2 Continuation ?3
which makes ?1 an available attachment site for
?4. Such implied constituents have been added to
the SDRS graphs.
Factoring Related to the operation of Ex-
pansion, SDRT?s definition of Continuation and
various subordinating relations also requires
that if we have R(a, [?1, ?2, . . . , ?n]) where
[?1, ?2, . . . , ?n] is a complex segment with
?1, . . . ?n linked by Continuation and R is Elabo-
ration, Entity-Elaboration, Frame, Attribution, or
Commentary, then we also have R(a, ?i) for each
i. We added these relations when they were miss-
ing.
4.2 Results
With the operations just described, we added sev-
eral inferred relations to the graph. We then cal-
culated statistics concerning the percentage of at-
tachments for which the RFC is respected using
the following formula:
RFCEDU =
# EDUs attached to the RF
# EDUs in total
As we explained, an EDU can be attached to an
SDRT graph directly by itself or indirectly as part
of a bigger complex segment. In order to calcu-
late the nominator we determine first whether an
EDU directly attaches to the graph?s RF, and if that
fails we determine whether it is part of a larger
complex segment which is attached to the graph?s
RF. The results obtained are shown in the first two
columns of table 2. The RFC is respected by at
least some attachment decision 95% of the time?
i.e., 95% of the EDUs get attached to another node
that is found on the RF. The breakdown across our
annotators is given in table 2.
SDRT allows for multiple attachments of an
EDU to various nodes in an SDRS; e.g. while an
EDU may be attached via one relation to a node
on the RF, it may be attached to another node off
the RF. To take account of all the attachments for a
given EDU, we need another way of measuring the
percentage of attachments that respects the RFC.
So we counted the ways each EDU is related to a
node in the SDRS for the previous text and then
divided the number of attachment decisions that
respect the RFC by the total number of attachment
decisions?i.e. :
RFCr =
# RF attachment decisions
# Total attachment decisions
.
annotator RFCEDU RFCr
undergrad 1 98.57% 91.28%
undergrad 2 98.12% 94.39%
undergrad 3 91.93% 89.17%
grad 1 94.38% 86.54%
grad 2 92.68% 83.57%
Mean for all annotators 95.24% 88.91%
Mean for 3 undergrad 96.17% 91.71%
Table 2: The % with which each annotator has re-
spected SDRT?s RFC using the EDU and attachment
decision measures.
The third column of table 2 shows that having
a stable annotation manual and GLOZZ improved
the results across our two annotator populations,
even though the annotation manual did not say
anything about RFC or about the structure of the
discourse graphs. Moreover, the distribution of vi-
olations of the RFC follows a power law and only
4.56% of the documents contained more than 5 vi-
olations. This is strong evidence that there is little
propagation of violations.
5 Analysis of Presumed Violations
Although 95% of EDUs attach to nodes on the
RF of an SDRT graph, 5% of EDUs don?t. SDRT
experts performed a qualitative analysis of some
of these presumed violations. In many cases, the
experts judged that the presumed violations were
due to click-errors: sometimes the annotators sim-
ply clicked on something that did not translate into
a segment. Sometimes, the experts judged that the
annotators picked the wrong segment to attach a
new segment or the wrong type of relation during
the construction of the SDRT graph. For example,
in the graph that follows the relation between seg-
ments 74 and 75 is not a Comment but an Entity-
Elaboration.
6
As expected, there were also ?structural? er-
rors, arising from a lack or a misuse of complex
segments. Here is a typical example (translated
from the original French):
[Around her,]_74 [we should mention Joseph
Racaille]_75 [responsible for the magnificent ar-
rangements,]_76 [Christophe Dupouy]_77 [reg-
ular associate of Jean-Louis Murat responsi-
ble for mixing,]_78 [without forgetting her two
guardian angels:]_79 [her agent Olivier Gluz-
man]_80 [who signed after a love at first
sight,]_81 [and her husband Mokhtar]_82 [who
has taken care of the family]_83
Here is the annotated structure up to EDU 78:
74
Comment
75
E-elab Cont
77
E-elab
76 78 (LAST)
Note that the attachment of 77 to 75 is non-local
and non-adjacent. The annotator then attaches
EDU 79 to 75 which is blocked from the RF due to
the Continuation coordinating relation. By not
having created a complex segment due the enu-
meration that includes EDUs 75 to 78, the annota-
tor had no option but to violate the RF. Here is the
proper SDRT graph for segments 74 to 79 (where
the attachment of 79 to 74 is also both non-local
and non-adjacent):
74
Elab
Elab
? 79
75
E-elabContinuation
77
E-elab
76 78
In this case, before the introduction of EDU 79,
EDU 78 is LAST and by consequence 77, ? and 74
are on the RF. Attaching 79 to 74 is thus legiti-
mate.
We also found more interesting examples of
right frontier violations. One annotator produced
a graph for a story which is about the attacks of
9/11/2001 and is too long to quote here. A sim-
plified graph of the first part of the story is shown
below. EDU 4 elaborates on the main event of the
story but it is not on the RF for 19. However, 19
is the first recurrence of the complex definite de-
scription le 11 septembre 2001 since the title and
the term?s definition in EDU 4.

This reuse of the full definite description could be
considered a case of SDRT?s discourse subordina-
tion.
6 RFC and distances of attachment
Our empirical study vindicates SDRT?s RFC, but
it also has computational implications. Using the
RFC dramatically diminishes the number of at-
tachment possibilities and thus greatly reduces the
search space for any incremental discourse pars-
ing algorithm.8 The mean of nodes that are open
on the RF at any given moment on our ANNODIS
data is 16.43% of all the nodes in the graph.
Our data also allowed us to calculate the dis-
tance of attachment sites from LAST, which could
be an important constraint on machine learning
algorithms for constructing discourse structures.
Given a pair of constituents (?i, ?j) distance is
calculated either textually (the number of inter-
vening EDUs between ?i and ?j) or topologically
(the length the shortest path between ?i and ?j).
Topological distance, however, does not take into
account the fact that a textually further segment is
cognitively less salient. Moreover, this measure
can give the same distance to nodes that are textu-
ally far away between them due to long distance
pop-ups (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). A purely
textual distance, on the other hand, gives the same
distance to an EDU ?i and a complex segment
[?1, . . . , ?i] even if ?1 and ?i are textually dis-
tant (since both have the same span end). We used
a measure combining both. The distance scheme
that we used assigns to each EDU its textual dis-
tance from LAST in the graph under consideration,
while a complex segment of rank 1 gets a distance
which is computed from the highest distance of
their constituent EDUs plus 1. For a constituent ?
of rank n we have:
Dist = Max{dist(x) : x in ?}+ n
8An analogous approach for search space reduction is fol-
lowed by duVerle and Prendinger (2009) who use the ?Prin-
ciple of Sequentiality? (Marcu, 2000), though they do not say
how much the search space is reduced.

The distribution of attachment follows a power
law with 40% of attachments performed non-
locally, that is on segments of distance 2 or more
(figure 1). This implies that the distance between
candidate attachment sites that are on the RF is an
important feature for an ML algorithm. It is impor-
tant to note at this point that following the baseline
approach of always attaching on the LAST misses
40% of attachments. We also have 20.38% of the
non-local, non-adjacent attachments in our anno-
tations. So an RST parser using Marcu?s (2000)
adjacency constraint as do duVerle and Prendinger
(2009) would miss these.

7 Related Work
Several studies have shown that the RFC may be
violated as an anaphoric constraint when there
are other clues, content or linguistic features, that
determine the antecedent. (Poesio and di Euge-
nio, 2001; Holler and Irmen, 2007; Asher, 2008;
Pr?vot and Vieu, 2008), for example, show that
anaphors such as definite descriptions and com-
plex demonstratives, which often provide enough
content on their own to isolate their antecedents,
or pronouns in languages like German which must
obey gender agreement, might remain felicitous
although the discourse relations between them and
their antecedents might violate the RFC. Usually
there are few linguistic clues that help find the
appropriate antecedent to a discourse relation, in
contrast to the anaphoric expressions mentioned
above. Exceptions involve stylistic devices like
direct quotation that license discourse subordina-
tion. Thus, SDRT predicts that RFC violations for
discourse attachments should be much more rare
than those for the resolution of anaphors that pro-
vide linguistic clues about their antecedents.
As regards other empirical validation of var-
ious versions of the RFC for the attachment of
discourse constituents, Wolf and Gibson (2006)
show an RST-like RFC is not supported in their
corpus GraphBank. Our study concurs in that
some 20% of the attachments in our corpus can-
not be formulated in RST.9 On the other hand,
we note that because of the 2 dimensional nature
of SDRT graphs and because of the caveats intro-
duced by structural relations and discourse sub-
ordination, the counterexamples from GraphBank
against, say, RST representations do not carry over
straightforwardly to SDRSs. In fact, once these
factors are taken into account, the RFC violations
in our corpus and in GraphBank are roughly about
the same.
8 Conclusions
We have shown that SDRT?s RFC has strong empir-
ical support: the attachments of our 3 completely
naive annotators fully comply with RFC 91.7% of
the time and partially comply with it 96% of the
time. As a constraint on discourse parsing SDRT?s
RFC, we have argued, is both empirically and
computationally motivated. We have also shown
that non-local attachments occur about 40% of the
time, which implies that attaching directly on the
LAST will not yield good results. Further, many of
the non local attachments do not respect RST?s ad-
jacency constraint. We need SDRT?s RFC to get the
right attachment points for our corpus. We believe
that empirical studies of the kind we have given
here are essential to finding robust and useful fea-
tures that will vastly improve discourse parsers.
9One other study we are aware of is Sassen and K?hn-
lein (2005), who show that in chat conversations, the RFC
does not always hold unconditionally. Since this genre of
discourse is not always coherent, it is expected that the RFC
will not always hold here.
