Abstract
We examine predicative adjectives as an unsu-
pervised criterion to extract subjective adjec-
tives. We do not only compare this criterion
with a weakly supervised extraction method
but also with gradable adjectives, i.e. another
highly subjective subset of adjectives that can
be extracted in an unsupervised fashion. In or-
der to prove the robustness of this extraction
method, we will evaluate the extraction with
the help of two different state-of-the-art senti-
ment lexicons (as a gold standard).
1 Introduction
Since the early work on sentiment analysis, it has
been established that the part of speech with the
highest proportion of subjective words are adjec-
tives (Wiebe et al, 2004) (see Sentence (1)). How-
ever, not all adjectives are subjective (2).
(1) A grumpy guest made some impolite remarks
to the insecure and inexperienced waitress.
(2) The old man wearing a yellow pullover sat on a
plastic chair.
This justifies the exploration of criteria to automati-
cally separate the subjective adjectives from the non-
subjective adjectives.
In this work, we are interested in an out-of-
context assessment of adjectives and therefore eval-
uate them with the help of sentiment lexicons. We
examine the property of being a predicative adjec-
tive as an extraction criterion. Predicative adjectives
are adjectives that do not modify the head of a noun
phrase, but which predicate a property of the refer-
ent of a noun phrase to which they are linked via a
copula or a control predicate (3).
We show that adjectives that frequently occur as
predicative adjectives are more likely to convey sub-
jectivity (in general) than adjectives that occur non-
predicatively, such as the pre-nominal (attributive)
adjectives (4). A subjective adjective may occur
both as a predicative (3) and a non-predicative (5)
adjective and also convey subjectivity in both con-
texts. However, a large fraction of non-subjective
adjectives do not occur as predicative adjectives (6).

2 Related Work
The extraction of subjective adjectives has already
attracted some considerable attention in previous re-
search. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) ex-
tract polar adjectives by a weakly supervised method
in which subjective adjectives are found by search-
ing for adjectives that are conjuncts of a pre-defined
set of polar seed adjectives. Wiebe (2000) in-
duces subjective adjectives with the help of distribu-
tional similarity. Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000)
examine the properties of dynamic, gradable and
polar adjectives as a means to detect subjectivity.
Vegnaduzzo (2004) presents another bootstrapping
method of extracting subjective adjectives with the
help of head nouns of the subjective candidates and
distributional similarity. Baroni and Vegnaduzzo
534
(2004) employ Web-based Mutual information for
this task and largely outperform the results produced
by Vegnaduzzo (2004).
3 Method
In the following, we present different features with
the help of which subjective adjectives can be ex-
tracted. For all resulting lists, the adjectives will be
ranked according to their frequency of co-occurring
with a particular feature.
3.1 Extracting Predicative Adjectives (PRD)
For the extraction of predicative adjectives, we ex-
clusively rely on the output of a dependency parser.
Predicative adjectives are usually connected to the
subject of the sentence via the dependency label
nsubj (Example (7) would correspond to Sen-
tence (3)).
(7) nsubj(brilliant, idea)
3.2 Extracting Gradable Adjectives (GRD)
As an alternative extraction method, we consider
morpho-syntactically gradable adjectives. Gradable
adjectives, such as nice or small, are adjectives ?that
can be inflected to specify the degree or grade of
something? (Wiktionary1). It has been stated in pre-
vious work that if some adjective can build a com-
parative (e.g. nicer) or a superlative (e.g. nicest),
then this adjective tends to be subjective (Hatzivas-
siloglou and Wiebe, 2000).
We employ the property of gradability, since,
firstly, it is very predictive towards subjectivity and,
secondly, it is the only other unsupervised criterion
currently known to extract subjective adjectives. For
the extraction of gradable adjectives, we rely, on the
one hand, on the part-of-speech labels JJR (com-
parative) and JJS (superlative). On the other hand,
we also consider adjectives being modified by ei-
ther more or most. For the former case, we need
to normalize the comparative (e.g. nicer) or superla-
tive (e.g. nicest) word form to the canonical positive
word form (e.g. nice) that is commonly used in sen-
timent lexicons.

3.3 Weakly-Supervised Extraction (WKS)
We also consider a weakly supervised extraction
method in this paper, even though it is not strictly
fair to compare such a method with our two pre-
vious extraction methods which are completely un-
supervised. WKS considers an adjective subjective,
if it co-occurs as a conjunct of a previously defined
highly subjective (seed) adjective (8). In order to de-
tect such conjunctions, we employ the dependency
relation conj. By just relying on surface patterns,
we would not be able to exclude spurious conjunc-
tions in which other constituents than the two adjec-
tives are coordinated, such as Sentence (10).
(8) This approach is ill-conceived and ineffective.
(9) conj(ill-conceived,
ineffective)
(10) [Evil witches are stereotypically dressed in
black] and [good fairies in white].
We also experimented with other related weakly-
supervised extraction methods, such as mutual in-
formation of two adjectives at the sentence level (or
even smaller window sizes). However, using con-
junctions largely outperformed these alternative ap-
proaches so we only pursue conjunctions here.
4 Experiments
As a large unlabeled (training) corpus, we chose the
North American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21)
comprising approximately 350 million words of
news text. For syntactic analysis we use the Stan-
ford Parser (Finkel et al, 2005). In order to decide
whether an extracted adjective is subjective or not,
we employ two sentiment lexicons, namely the Sub-
jectivity Lexicon (SUB) (Wilson et al, 2005) and
SO-CAL (SOC) (Taboada et al, 2011). According to
the recent in-depth evaluation presented in Taboada
et al (2011), these two sentiment lexicons are the
most effective resources for English sentiment anal-
ysis. By taking into account two different lexicons,
which have also been built independently of each
other, we want to provide evidence that our pro-
posed criterion to extract subjective adjectives is not
sensitive towards a particular gold standard (which
would challenge the general validity of the proposed
method).

In order to produce the subjective seed adjec-
tives for the weakly supervised extraction, we col-
lect from the sentiment lexicon that we evaluate the
n most frequent subjective adjectives according to
our corpus. In order to further improve the quality
of the seed set, we only consider strong subjective
expressions from SUB and expressions with the in-
tensity strength ?5 from SOC.
Table 1 lists the size of the different sentiment lex-
icons and the rankings produced by the different ex-
traction methods. Of course, the list of all adjectives
from the corpus (ALL) is the largest list2 while PRD
is the second largest and GRD the third largest. The
rankings produced by WKS are fairly sparse, in par-
ticular the ones induced with the help of SOC; ap-
parently there are more frequently occurring strong
subjective adjectives in SUB than there are high in-
tensity adjectives in SOC.
4.1 Frequent Adjectives vs. Frequent
Predicative Adjectives
Table 2 compares the 30 most frequent adjectives
(ALL) and predicative adjectives (PRD). Not only
does this table show that the proportion of subjective
adjectives is much larger among the predicative ad-
jectives but we may also gain some insight into what
non-subjective adjectives are excluded. Among the
high frequent adjectives are many quantifiers (many,
few and several) and ordinal expressions (first, next
and last). In principle, most of these expressions
are not subjective. One may argue that these adjec-
tives behave like function words. Since they occur
2It will also contain many words erroneously tagged as ad-
jectives, however, this is unlikely to affect our experiments since
we only focus on the highly ranked (i.e. most frequent) words.
The misclassifications rather concern infrequent words.
very frequently, one might exclude some of them
by just ignoring the most frequent adjectives. How-
ever, there are also other types of adjectives, espe-
cially pertainyms (political, federal, economic, pub-
lic, American, foreign, local, military, financial and
national) that appear on this list which could not be
excluded by that heuristic. We found that these non-
subjective content adjectives are present throughout
the entire ranking and they are fairly frequent (on
the ranking). On the list of predicative adjectives all
these previous types of adjectives are much less fre-
quent. Many of them only occur on lower ranks (and
we assume that several of them only got on the list
due to parsing errors).
4.2 Comparison of the Different Extraction
Methods
Table 3 compares the precision of the different ex-
traction methods at different cut-off values. It is in-
teresting to see that for ALL in particular the higher
ranks are worse than the lower ranks (e.g. rank
1000). We assume that this is due to the high-
frequency adjectives which are similar to function
words (see Section 4.1). At all cut-off values, how-
ever, this baseline is beaten by every other method,
including our proposed method PRD. The two unsu-
pervised methods PRD and GRD perform on a par
with each other. On SUB, PRD even mostly out-
performs GRD. The precision achieved by WKS is
quite good. However, the coverage of this method
is low. It would require more seed expressions to
increase it, however, this would also mean consider-
ably more manual guidance.
Table 3 also shows that the precision of all ex-
traction methods largely drops on the lower ranks.
However, one should not conclude from that the ex-
traction methods proposed only work well for highly
frequent words. The drop can be mostly explained
by the fact that the two sentiment lexicons we use
for evaluation are finite (i.e. SUB: 4396 words/SOC:
2827 words (Table 1)), and that neither of these lexi-
cons (nor their union) represents the complete set of
all English subjective adjectives. Both lexicons will
have a bias towards frequently occurring subjective
expressions.
Inspecting the ranks 3001-3020 produced by PRD
as displayed in Table 4, for example, actually reveals
that there are still many more subjective adjectives

than the matches with our sentiment lexicons sug-
gest (e.g. appealable, accomodating, well-meaning,
weakest, unsurpassed, unopposed, unobjectionable,
unemployable, uncharacteristic or speechless). In
other words, these are less frequent words; many
of them are actually subjective even though they are
not listed in the sentiment lexicons. Moreover, irre-
spective of the drop in precision on the lower ranks,
PRD and GRD still outperform ALL on both senti-
ment lexicons (Table 3). Despite the sparseness of
our two gold standards on the lower ranks, we thus
have some indication that PRD and GRD are more
effective than ALL.
The problem of the evaluation of less-frequent
words could not be solved by an extrinsic evaluation,
either, e.g. by using the extracted lists for some text
classification task (at the sentence/document level).
The evaluation on contextual classification on cor-
pora would also be biased towards high-frequency
words (as the word distribution is typically Zipfian).
For instance, on the MPQA-corpus (Wiebe et al,
2005), i.e. the standard dataset for (fine-grained)
sentiment analysis, there is not a single mention of
the subjective words appealable, accommodating,
unsurpassed, unopposed, unobtrusive or speechless,
which were found among the lower ranks 3001-
3020.
4.3 How Different Are Gradable and
Predicative Adjectives?
Since in the previous experiments the proportion of
subjective adjectives was similar among the grad-
able adjectives and the predicative adjectives, we
may wonder whether these two extraction methods
produce the same adjectives. In principle, the set of
gradable adjectives extracted is much smaller than
the list of extracted predicative adjectives (see Ta-
ble 1). We found that the gradable adjectives are
a proper subset of predicative adjectives, which is
in line with the observation by (Bolinger, 1972,
21) that gradable adjectives (which he calls degree
words) readily occur predicatively whereas non-
gradable ones tend not to.
However, while gradability implies compatibility
with predicative use, the reverse is not true. Ac-
cordingly, we found adjectives that are definitely not
gradable among the predicative adjectives that are
subjective, for instance endless, insolvent, nonexis-
tent, stagnant, unavailable or untrue. This means
that with the criterion of predicative adjectives one
is able to extract relevant subjective adjectives that
cannot be caught by the gradability criterion alone,
namely complementary adjectives that refer to a sim-
ple binary opposition (Cruse, 1986, 198-99).
4.4 Intersecting the Different Unsupervised
Criteria
In this section, we want to find out whether we can
increase the precision by considering intersections
of the two different unsupervised extraction crite-
ria. (Due to the sparsity of WKS, it does not make
sense to include that method in this experiment.) In
our previous experiments it turned out that as far as
precision is concerned, our new proposed extraction
criterion was similar to the gradability criterion. If,
however, the intersection of these two criteria pro-
duces better results, then we have provided some
further proof of the effectiveness of our proposed
criterion (even though we may sacrifice some exclu-
sive subjective adjectives in PRD as pointed out in
Section 4.3). It would mean that this criterion is also
beneficial in the presence of the gradability criterion.
Figure 1 shows the corresponding results. We
computed the intersection of PRD and GRD at var-

ious cut-off values of n. The resulting intersection
comprises m ranks with m < n. The precision of
the intersection was consequently compared against
the precision of PRD and GRD at rank m. The figure
shows that with the exception of the higher ranks on
SUB (< 200) there is indeed a systematic increase
in precision when the intersection of PRD and GRD
is considered.
5 Conclusion
We examined predicative adjectives as a criterion
to extract subjective adjectives. As this extraction
method is completely unsupervised, it is preferable
to weakly supervised extraction methods since we
are not dependent on a manually designed high qual-
ity seed set and we obtain a much larger set of ad-
jectives. This extraction method is competitive if
not slightly better than gradable adjectives. In ad-
dition, combining these two unsupervised methods
by assessing their intersection results mostly in an
increase in precision.
