The Trans format lona l  quest ion  Answer ing (TqA) system 
was developed over  a per iod  o f  t ime beg inn ing  in the  
ear ly  par t  o f  the  las t  decade and cont inu ing  to  the  
present .  I t s  syntact i c  component i s  a t rans format iona l  
grammar parser  \ [1 ,  2, ~\ ] ,  and i t s  semant ic  Gomponqnt i s  
a Knuth a t t r ibute  grammor \ [~,  5 \ ] .  The combinat ion  o f  
these components providQs sufficiQnt generality, 
conveniQnga, and eff iciency to implement a broad range 
of l inguistic models; in addition to a wide spectrum of 
t rans format iona l  grammars, G i lder - type  phrase 
s t ructure  grammar \ [6 \ ]  and lex iga l  funct iona l  grammar 
\ [7 \ ]  systems appear to  be cases in  po in t ,  fo r  example.  
The Par t i cu la r  grammar Nhich was, in fac t ,  deve loped,  
however,  was c losest  tO those  o f  the  genQrat ive  
semant ics  var ie ty  o f  t r sns format ione l  grammar; both  the  
under ly ing  s t ructures  ass igned to  sQntences and the  
t rans format ions  employed to  e f fec t  that  assignmQnt 
t raced  the i r  o r ig ins  to  the  generat ive  semant ics  model.  
The system ~orks  by f ind ing  the  undQr ly ing  s t ructures  
cor respond ing  tO Eng l i sh  quer ies  through the  use o f  the  
t rans format iona l  pars ing  fac i l i ty .  Those under ly ing  
s t ructures  are  then t rans la ted  to  log ica l  fo rms in  a 
domain re la t iono l  ca lcu lus  by the  Knuth a t t r ibute  
grammar component.  Eva luat ion  o f  log ica l  forms w i th  
respect  to  a g iven  data base completes  the  
quest ion -answer ing  process .  Our f i r s t  log ica l  form 
eva luator  took  the  form o f  a toy  imp lementat ion  o f  a 
re la t iona l  data  base system in L ISP.  We soon ree laced  
the  low leve l  tup le  re t r ieva l  fac i l i t i es  o f  th i s  
imp lementat ion  w i th  the  RSS (Re la t iona l  StorogQ System) 
por t ion  o f  the  IBM System R \ [8 \ ] ,  Th is  vers ion  o f  log ico l  
form evo luat ion  was the  one employed in  the  f ie ld  
tes t ing  to  be dQscr ibed.  In  a more recent  vers ion  o f  the  
system, however,  i t  has been rep lacod  by a t rans la t ion  
of l og ica l  fo rms,  f i r s t  to  equivalent l og ica l  forms in 
a set  domain re la t iona l  ca lcu lus  and then to  
appropr ia te  express ions  in the 5e l  language,  SystQm RIs 
h igh  leve l  query language.  
The f i r s t  data  base to  which  the  system was app l ied  was 
one concern ing  bus iness  s ta t i s t i cs  such as the  sa les ,  
earn ings ,  number o f  employees,  e tc .  o f  60 la rge  
companies over  a f i ve -year  Per iod .  Th is  was a toy  data  
base,  to  be sure ,  but  i t  was use fu l  tO US in deve lop ing  
our  System. A la ter  dota  base conta ined  the  bas ic  land 
ident i f i ca t ion  records  o f  about  10,000 parce ls  o f  land 
in  a c i ty  nQar our  research  center .  I t  WaS deve loped fo r  
use by members o f  the  c i ty  p lann ing  departmQnt and 
( less  f requent ly )  o ther  depar tments  to  answQr quest ions  
concern ing  the  in fo rmat ion  in that  f i l e .  Our purpose in  
making the  1system ava i lab le  to  those  c i ty  employees 
was, of course ,  to prov ide  access to  o data  base of real 
interest to a group of users and to fiQld test our 
system by evaluating their usa of it. Accordingly, thQ 
TqA system was ta i lo red  to  the  land usa f i l e  
opp l tcat ion  and ins ta l led  a t  C i ty  Ha l l  a t  the  and o f  
1977. I t  remained there  dur ing  1978 and 1979, dur ing  
which  t ime i t  WaS used in tormi t tent ly  as thQ need arose  
fo r  ad hoc cuQry to  supplement thQ repor t  generat ion  
programs that  were a l ready  ava i lab le  fo r  the  ext ract ion  
o f  in fo rmat ion .  
Tota l  usage o f  the  system Was less  than  we had expected  
would be the  case when We made the  dec is ion  to  proceed 
w i th  th i s  app l i ca t ion .  Th is  resu l ted  f rom a number o f  
fac tors ,  inc lud ing  a change in  miss ion  fo r  the  p lann ing  
depar tment ,  a reduct ion  in  the  number o f  peop le  in that  
dQpartment,  a dec is ion  tO rebu i ld  the  o f f i ce  space 
during the period Of usage, and a degree of 
obso lescence  o f  the  data  due to  the  length  o f  time 
between uodatQS (which were to have been supplied by 
the  p lann ing  depar tment ) .  Dur ing 1978 a to ta l  of 788 
queries were addressed to  the system, and during 1979 
the  to ta l  ~as 210. Damerau \ [9 \ ]  giVQS thQ d is t r ibut ion
