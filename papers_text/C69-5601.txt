0.0 Phonolo$ical typologies~ statistical counts and mathematical models 
The high structuring of phonology, the obvious classes of 
sounds, and the classes of their classes, have made phonological 
typologies a not too rare proposal. And even where typologies were 
not claimed as such, they were often implicit in the statements made. 
Both phonetic and phonemic, acoustic and articulatory, structural and 
non-structural, have all been proposed and have evoked discussions, 
critiques and applications. 
One can mention works by the Prague linguists culminating 
in the writings of, among others, Skali~ka, Kramsky, and no=ably 
Trubetzkoy and Jakobson. In America, we have work by Greenberg, 
Hockett, Saporta and Voegelin as well as numerous followers and 
critics. Among other European contributions the acoustic typologies 
by Menzerath and Meyer-Eppler. 
0.i Mathematical models and mathematlcal (more precisely sta- 
tistical) techniques of analysis have also been elaborated. Classi- 
fication, distribution and frequency characteristics of various sound 
patterns have been a particular concern and represent the bulk of 
numerical phonological typologies, especially in the U.S, I Often, 
again, the subject is classification of inventories and particular 
types (articulatory) of phonemeS. Such is, for instance, Pierce~s 
"A Statistical Study of New World Consonants", with counts of from the 
most to the least eo~on consonants and classes of consonants in 
a great number of Amerindian languager,, A critique end evaluation 
is found in Saporta 1957. We have probably the least structural 
end of the typological spectrum here. 
1.6 .... :~i c=_v,: fcauure typolo$ies 
There is another series of phonological typologies based 
on Jakobson's distinctive feature analysis and of course their 
Praguian and particularly their Trubetzkoyan background. 2 
2.0 The distinctive feature indices of Andre j Avram 
Typological indices derived from Jakobsonian featureswere 
proposed by Andrej Avram (1961). to study the distribution of 
distinctive features in the phonological system. 
well): 
Avram proposes the following indices (if I understand him 
P = number of phonemes 
T = number of features 
D = number of features with which each feature combines 
D m = average distribution of distinctive features 
R = coverage of each feature (how many phonemes it 
characterizes) 
Rm = coverage of the system as such (:R/T) 
C = complexity of a phoneme, i.e. how many features 
it is a bundle of 
C m - average complexity of the system (-EC/P) 
E = efficiency of a system; E-P/T 
2.1 
Avram also includes maxima and minima for Dm, Rm, Cm. 
His typology was a good first step for studying systems 
via their feature distribution. However, there are cases, such as 
the following two hypothetical systems, different (but of undecided 
distance), which Avram's typology fails to distinguish. 3

Rm = 1 or 33.33% R' m = 1 or 33.33% 
E - P/T = 3/4 - .75 E' = P'/T' = 3/4 = 
.75 
Cm - (i ~ 2 + 2)/3 = 5/3 = 1.66 C'm = (2+2+1)/3 = 
5/3 - 1.66 
It is obvious after inspection of the indices, that the two 
systems are not distinguls~ed. Such a loss  of information is character- 
istic of averaging. 
3.0 Postovalova's valence and probabi l i ty indices 
More complicated yet much more adequate measures of dist inctive 
feature distributions were proposed by the Soviet l inguist Postovalova. 
Although they were first used for the study of Just one systems typological 
appl ications were also suggested by the author. 
Postovalova's paper in Problemy Lingulsti~eskogo Anal iza 
examines the subject of feature distr ibution in a phonological system. 
Severa~ statistics are defined: 
3.1 
3.2 
simple probability, i.e. frequency of utilization of a 
feature by the system for phoneme composition; the three 
possibilities, +, --, 0 are considered separately. 
For feature a we have: 
i ! where m = number of rows with 
m 
Pa = ~ n = number of rows. 
conditional probabilities, indicating how frequently 
different pairs of features characterize phonemes in the 
system, which is to say, given feature a for a phoneme 
what are the chances that feature b will combine with a 
in the same phoneme. 
Given feature ~ the probability that ~ will combine with 
it for th~ same phoneme is: 
i ?i Pa(b) = 
where m' - number of phonemes with a and b 
n' - number of phonemes with ~.  
3.3 Finally, Valence is defined by Postovalova to disclose 
information on a feature's combinability with the o~her 
features and also information on the system as a whole 
(by including total number of features). 
I Va(b) = Pa(b-----~) i where n = t?tal number ?f d i s t i n c t i V n  -  1 
features in the system. 
(The probability of a feature appearing combined with another 
feature would ben~ 1 if all features were equiprobable.) 
3.4 lllustracion from the hypothetical case of 2.1 (The Valence proposed 
by Postovalova is modified hy Afendras (1968), so that it appears as 
foature by feature matrix: this step is very important as it makes 
comparison across languages a matter of comparison of features drawn 
from the "Universal" system, rather than comparison between vowels 
and their features.)

4.0 Valence analysis of Balkan vocalic systems 
And now an application of this quantitative typology to a 
specific problem: the Balkan linguistic convergence area. Non-phonolog- 
Ica! aspects have been thoroughly investigated, in the classic treat- 
~ent by Sandfeld (1930) and most recently in some powerful typological 
4.1 
4.2 
studies (Kazazis, Civ'jan, Birnbaum in several articles, Klagstadt, 
etc.) Balkan phonology has prompted many comments by Jakobson, Ivid 
and others, but to my knowledge only one systematic study (Havr~nek, 
1933) which actually drew heavy criticism (Ma~ecki Stankiewicz). 
Interesting results were obtained by aPPlying the above method to the 
4 study of several Balkan idioms. 
But before discussing the results some of the basic problems 
encountered will be mentioned: 
The  systems were compared against a maximal matrix which 
included all the features occurring in the population of the systems 
analyzed. 5 
Any of the actual systems include a subset of this maximal 
set of features. In the final correlation each system was considered 
as having O's throughout for the features which it did not utilize. 
But 0Ws were also indicative of impertinence of a feature for a given 
phoneme when the feature was distinctive for other phonemes in the 
system. Thus two kinds of concepts were collapsed as they both were 
represented by 0. However, this has probably been rectified by the 
fact that features not used in a system have a 0 throughout, 
Another actual handicap is the non-availability of distinctive 
feature descriptions for the vast majority of the systems compared. 
And even when available, they were often tinted by both the author's 
views and his preferences (e.g. Petrovici on Rumanian) or were out of 
different periods of theoretical development of distinctive features. 
8 
4.3 
in such cases, I took the liberty of normalizing the data by modifying 
the existing analyses (:the same method was followed throughout e.g. 
constructing branching-trees). In some other instances more than one 
solution were possible and for lack of data I kept the alternatives. 
Such systems appear in the figures as language X-l, 2, 3 etc. Other 
instances of numbered, multiple systems for one language refer to 
situations where such variety actually exists either stylistically or 
in social dialects (e.g. literary Makedonskl). 
Some features are very typical of vocalic systems either 
universally, or for the European languages, or, more specifically, for 
the Balkan languages. E.G. diffuseness, ~ ,  flatness, stress 
(simDle occurrence is considered here, no____tttcombinations). Then, other 
features s.a. length, ton_.___~e, ~ e t c .  are much less common. An 
ideal comparison should give different weights to such features. 
Sharing nasality, for instance, should be typologically very significant 
and two systems which do, should be classed as very similar. Converse- 
ly, if in a group of many languages which draw on 5-6 features to dis- 
tinguish their vowels, but usually have 3 or 4, only one uses nasality 
this should be significant enough to set this particular language quite 
far apart. Now, in the correlation some factors take this into account 
but indirectly and not sufficiently. On the other hand since in 
I 
reality (i.e. in the Balkan case) systems having "odd" features have 
also the "common" features, their typological distance is reflected 
in their having a higher number of features than the other languages, 
6 
a fact reflected in the Valence matrix (:lower values for each cell). 
4.4 The introduction of a new feature usually results in a whole 
series of new phonemes, and actual ly the more numerous these phonemes 
the more important the new feature to the system. This is expressed 
by the product of number of distinctive features X number of phonemes = 
total # of cells in the feature by phoneme matrix. An index incorporat- 
ing this wi l l  reflect more qualit ies of the whole system. I propose 
therefor~tentat ive lysa modif icat ion of the valence formula to: 
V~(b) = Pa(b) where K - # of phonemes ? (n -i) 
This we ight inEmakes  the index much more sensitive to varia- 
tions in the number of features. 
4.5 Higher order conditional probabil it ies can also be intro- 
duced, e.g. 1 \] Pab (c) = ~m 
where K = number of phonemes which have in common 
features a, b and ~, and 
m = number of phonemes with a and b in common. 
A Valence Vab(c) PaD(c) (n-l) can then be defined. 
And so on until  we have the PI . . . (n-2) (n-l) and the result ing 
Valence. 
The results presented here are based on Postovalova's original formula.

5.0 Statistical correlation of Balkan Valence matrices 
51 vocalic System matrices were actually analyzed, their P , P (b) a a 
and V (b) matrices calculated~and these final matrices were correlated a 
and plotted using two different methods according to distance from 
each other. 7 
Gammon (1967) used a similar statistical technique for 
finding the similarity (conversely, the distance) between several 
Polynesian languages. In his case, the information was not in the 
form of matrices but in the farm of lists. 
6.0 Results 
in the final plotting (see figures I, 2, 3 and 4) several groupings 
can be discerned. 
First, in the multidimensionalsealin~ analysis, we can 
speak roughly of 3 groups: two form a sort of a nucleus in the center 
and the third (distributed in two subgroups also) surrounds it. 
On the external group we have Old Church Slavic, and close by Common 
Slavic. Then spread around mostly Serbo-croatlan dialects, with some 
other idioms (e.g. 7-vowel Mom~ilovci Bulgarian,(9#Nasal) vowels Barile 
Tosk Albanian, 8-vowel Meglenitie, 7-vowel E. Bosnia Serbo-croatian). 
This group seems to include only dialects with the feature of tenseness. 
Except for the Albanian dialect, all group members are dialects located

in the Central Balkans, i.e. we have here an areal grouping. 
Four out of six Albanian systems 
(all of the dialects within the geographic area of the Balkans) fall 
in one group and are  closer to Macedonian and Bulgarian than to 
Rumanlan. 
Greek dialects are quite diffused but stay within the two 
nuclear groups (this includes Classical Attic and Medieval Greek.) 
In the diz~eter method (figure 4), the most interesting 
grouping is that of all seven systems with the 5-vowel pattern 
(irrespective of additional features such as length - nasality - tone) 
on the same side of the initial bifurcation. 
Another subgrouplng includes only systems which use flatness 
to distinguish a second series of hack vowels (Rhodope Bulgarlan, 
Kra~ova I Serbo-croatian, Bulgarian Saraka~an Greekp and Hrupi~ta 
Arumenian). 
Among the other interesLing results are the following: con- 
trary to Old Church Slavic and Common Slavic, which in both analyses 
stand apart, Attic Greek is classed as very similar to the bulk of the 
systems analyzed: in the diameter method throug h early Joining of the 
branching tree, and in the multidimensional sealing by being located 
in the middle of the one of the two central constellations. This is 
all the mere intriguing in the light of the fact that in a similar

systems expressed i n  the Harary-Paper model for binary phoneme 
combinations. Attic was also in the center of the group and OCS (as 
well as Czech) quite distant from it. Is this not a strong indication 
of convergence of South Slavic towards a pattern characteristic of 
Greek since the time of Attic? If anythlng, one would intuitively 
class the old idioms (Common Slavic, OCS and Attic) as belonging to 
roughly the same ?ype~: large systems, length, toner accent etc. as 
additional features. What "latent" structures are  responsible for the 
outcome of the statistical analysis?

It seems that no two "mirror" systems could be distinguished 
by this typology. A theoretical shortcoming in spite of the 
fact that not  terribly many such cases exist. 
Much of the data analysis used for the present paper was done 
at the Johns Hopkins University, as part of my doctoral 
research which culminated in a thesis (May 1968). 
The idea of a maximal system thus defined can also be found 
in Voegelin 1963. Uspenskij (1965:63) defines it as follows, 
opposite to a minimal system: "Jazyk-~talon pervogo tipa

points out that the minimal system in a sense "catches the 
essence" of the languages to be compared. See also the Ph.D.

Birnbaum (1966:20) in his discussion of Uspenskij above

therefore distances from the rest. "It is tempting to guess 
that the scatter In Rumanian could reflect the influence of 
non Romance speech communities that have interacted with the 
Rumanian community (or communities) '' .

SUMMARY 
In this study, the vocalic systems of a large number of Balkan 
idioms (past and present) were analyzed in terms of Jakobsonian 
distinctive features. Various methods for comparison and scaling 
for similarity, as well as the problems encountered, are discussed 
and evaluated. Some questions of typology, such as distinctive 
feature weights, are revealed; suggestions are made for their 
future incorporation into typologies of this nature. 
It is a srtrprJusing fact in l inguistic scholarship that no 
feasible,  nor adequate manner  for compar ing phonological sys tems 
quantitat ively has been devised. The notion of dist inct ive feature 
va lenceproposed  by the Russ ian l inguist, V. I. Pos tova lova ,  
answers  the need for such a feature distr ibut ion measure .  
The valence matr i ces  for the vocal ic sys tems of f l fty-one 
Balkan idioms, as well as s imple and joint probabi l i t ies of d ist inct ive 
feature occur rence  are  calculated. Finally, the resu l ts  are  corre lated 
and submitted to computer ized factor analys is  (various programs) .
