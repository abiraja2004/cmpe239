Abstract
This paper presents a new approach to im-
proving relation extraction based on min-
imally supervised learning. By adding
some limited closed-world knowledge for
confidence estimation of learned rules to
the usual seed data, the precision of re-
lation extraction can be considerably im-
proved. Starting from an existing base-
line system we demonstrate that utilizing
limited closed world knowledge can ef-
fectively eliminate ?dangerous? or plainly
wrong rules during the bootstrapping pro-
cess. The new method improves the re-
liability of the confidence estimation and
the precision value of the extracted in-
stances. Although recall suffers to a cer-
tain degree depending on the domain and
the selected settings, the overall perfor-
mance measured by F-score considerably
improves. Finally we validate the adapt-
ability of the best ranking method to a new
domain and obtain promising results.
1 Introduction
Minimally supervised machine-learning ap-
proaches to learning rules or patterns for relation
extraction (RE) in a bootstrapping framework are
regarded as very effective methods for building
information extraction (IE) systems and for
adapting them to new domains (e. g., (Riloff,
1996), (Brin, 1998), (Agichtein and Gravano,
2000), (Yangarber, 2001), (Sudo et al, 2003),
(Jones, 2005), (Greenwood and Stevenson,
2006), (Agichtein, 2006), (Xu et al, 2007),
(Xu, 2007)). On the one hand, these approaches
show very promising results by utilizing minimal
domain knowledge as seeds. On the other hand,
they are all confronted with the same problem,
i.e., the acquisition of wrong rules because of
missing knowledge for their validation during
bootstrapping. Various approaches to confidence
estimation of learned rules have been proposed
as well as methods for identifying ?so-called?
negative rules for increasing the precision value
(e.g., (Brin, 1998), (Agichtein and Gravano,
2000), (Agichtein, 2006), (Yangarber, 2003),
(Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Etzioni et al,
2005), (Xu et al, 2007) and (Uszkoreit et al,
2009)).
In this paper, we present a new approach to esti-
mating or ranking the confidence value of learned
rules by utilizing limited closed-world knowl-
edge. As many predecessors, our ranking method
is built on the ?Duality Principle? (e. g., (Brin,
1998), (Yangarber, 2001) and (Agichtein, 2006)).
We extend the validation method by an evalu-
ation of extracted instances against some lim-
ited closed-world knowledge, while also allowing
cases in which knowledge for informed decisions
is not available. In comparison to previous ap-
proaches to negative examples or negative rules
such as (Yangarber, 2003), (Etzioni et al, 2005)
and (Uszkoreit et al, 2009), we implicitly gener-
ate many negative examples by utilizing the pos-
itive examples in the closed-world portion of our
knowledge. Rules extracting wrong instances are
lowered in rank.
In (Xu et al, 2007) and (Xu, 2007), we develop
a generic framework for learning rules for rela-
tions of varying complexity, called DARE (Do-
main Adaptive Relation Extraction). Furthermore,
there is a systematic error analysis of the base-
1354
line system conducted in (Xu, 2007). We employ
our system both as a baseline reference and as a
platform for implementing and evaluating our new
method.
Our first experiments conducted on the same
data used in (Xu et al, 2007) demonstrate: 1) lim-
ited closed-world knowledge is very useful and ef-
fective for improving rule confidence estimation
and precision of relation extraction; 2) integration
of soft constraints boosts the confidence value of
the good and relevant rules, but without strongly
decreasing the recall value. In addition, we val-
idate our method on a new corpus of newspaper
texts about celebrities and obtain promising re-
sults.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 explains the relevant related work.
Sections 3 and 4 describe DARE and our exten-
sions. Section 5 reports the experiments with
two ranking strategies and their results. Section
6 gives a summary and discusses future work.
2 Related Work
In the existing minimally supervised rule learning
systems for relation extraction based on bootstrap-
ping, they already employ various approaches to
confidence estimation of learned rules and differ-
ent methods for identification of so-called nega-
tive rules. For estimation of confidence/relevance
values of rules, most of the approaches follow
the so-called ?Duality Principle? as mentioned by
Brin (1998) and Yangarber (2001), namely, the
confidence value of learned rules is dependent
on the confidence value of their origins, which
can be documents or relation instances. For ex-
ample, Riloff (1996), Yangarber (2001), Sudo et
al. (2003) and Greenwood and Stevenson (2006)
use domain relevance of documents in which pat-
terns are discovered as well as the distribution fre-
quency of these patterns in those relevant docu-
ments as an indication of good patterns. Their
methods are aimed at detecting all patterns for
a specific domain, but those patterns cannot be
applied directly to a specific relation. In con-
trast, systems presented by Brin (1998), Agichtein
and Gravano (2000), Agichtein (2006), Pantel
and Pennacchiotti (2006) as well as our base-
line system (Xu et al, 2007) are designed to
learn rules for a specific relation. They start with
some relation instances as their so-called ?seman-
tic seeds? and detect rules from texts matching
with these instances. The new rules are applied
to new texts for extracting new instances. These
new instances in turn are utilized as new seeds.
All these systems calculate their rule confidence
based on the confidence values of the instances
from which they stem. In addition to the confi-
dence value of the seed instances, most of them
also consider frequency information and include
some heuristics for extra validation. For exam-
ple, Agichtein (2006) intellectually defines certain
constraints for evaluating the truth value of ex-
tracted instances. But it is not clear whether this
strategy can be adapted to new domains and other
relations. In (Xu et al, 2007) we make use of do-
main relevance values of terms occurring in rules.
This method is not applicable to general relations.
Parallel to confidence estimation strategies, the
learning of negative rules is useful for identifying
wrong rules straightforwardly. Yangarber (2003)
and Etzioni et al (2005) utilize the so-called
Counter-Training for detecting negative rules for
a specific domain or a specific class by learning
from multiple domains or classes at the same time.
Examples of one certain domain or class are re-
garded as negative examples for the other ones.
Bunescu and Mooney (2007) follow a classifi-
cation-based approach to RE. They use positive
and negative sentences of a target relation for a
SVM classifier. Uszkoreit et al (2009) exploit
negative examples as seeds for learning further
negative instances and negative rules. The dis-
advantage of the above four approaches is that
the selected negative domains or classes or neg-
ative instances cover only a subset of the neg-
ative domains/classes/relations of the target do-
main/class/relation.
3 DARE Baseline System
Our baseline system DARE is a minimally super-
vised learning system for relation extraction, ini-
tialized by so-called ?semantic seeds?, i.e., exam-
ples of the target relations, labelled with their se-
mantic roles. The system supports domain adap-
tation through a compositional rule representation
and a bottom-up rule discovery strategy. In this
1355
way, DARE can handle target relations of varying
arity. The following example is a relation instance
of the target relation from (Xu, 2007) concerning
Nobel Prize awards: <Mohamed ElBaradei, No-
bel, Peace, 2005>. The target relation contains
four arguments: WINNER, PRIZE NAME, PRIZE AREA
and YEAR. This example refers to an event men-
tioned in the sentence in example (1).
(1) Mohamed ElBaradei, won the 2005 Nobel
Prize for Peace on Friday because of ....
Figure 1 is a simplified dependency tree of ex-
ample (1). DARE utilizes a bottom-up rule dis-
covery strategy to extract rules from such depen-
dency trees. All sentences are processed with
named entity recognition and dependency parsing.

From the tree in Figure 1, DARE learns three
rules. The first rule is dominated by the prepo-
sition ?for?, extracting the argument PRIZE AREA
(Area). The second rule is dominated by the noun
?Prize?, extracting the arguments YEAR (Year) and
PRIZE NAME (Prize), and calling the first rule for
the argument PRIZE AREA (Area). The rule ?win-
ner prize area year 1? from Figure 2 extracts all
four arguments from the verb phrase dominated
by the verb ?win? and calls the second rule to
handle the arguments embedded in the linguistic
argument ?object?.

Figure 2: DARE extraction rule.
We conduct a systematic error analysis based
on our experiments with the Nobel Prize award
data (Xu, 2007). The learned rules are divided
into four groups: good, useless, dangerous and
bad. The good rules are rules that only extract cor-
rect instances, while bad ones exclusively produce
wrong instances. Useless rules are those that do
not detect any new instances. Dangerous rules are
dangerous because they extract both correct and
wrong instances. Most good rules are rules with
high specificity, namely, extracting all or most ar-
guments of the target relation. The 14.7% extrac-
tion errors are from bad rules and dangerous rules.
Other errors are caused by wrong reported con-
tent, negative modality, parsing and named entity
recognition errors.
4 Our Approach: Boosting Relation Ex-
traction
4.1 Closed-World Knowledge: Modeling and
Construction
The error analysis of DARE confirms that the
identification of bad rules or dangerous rules is
important for the precision of an extraction sys-
tem. Using closed-world knowledge with large
numbers of implicit negative instances opens a
possibility to detect such rules directly. In our
work, closed-world knowledge for a target rela-
tion is the total set of positive relation instances
for entire relations or for some selected subsets
of individuals. For most real world applications,
closed-world knowledge can only be obtained for
relatively small subsets of individuals participat-
ing in the relevant relations. We store the closed-
world knowledge in a relational database, which
we dub ?closed-world knowledge database? (abbr.
cwDB). Thus, a cwDB for a target relation should
fill the following condition:
A cwDB must contain all correct relation
instances (insts) for an instantiation value
(argValue) of a selected relation argument
cwArg in the target relation.
Given R (the total set of relation instances of a
target relation), a cwDB is defined as follows:
cwDB={inst ? R : cwArg(inst) = argValue}.
An example of a cwDB is the set of all prize win-
ners of a specific prize area such as Peace, where
PRIZE AREA is the selected cwArg and argValue is
Peace. Note that the merger of two cwDBs, for
example with PRIZE AREAs Peace and Literature,
is again a cwDB (with two argValues in this case).

4.2 Modified Learning Algorithm
In Algorithm 1, we present the modification of the
DARE algorithm (Xu, 2007). The basic idea of
DARE is that it takes some initial seeds as input
and learns relation extraction rules from sentences
in the textual corpus matching the seeds. Given
the learned rules, it extracts new instances from
the texts. The modified algorithm adds the val-
idate step to evaluate the new instances against
the closed-world knowledge cwDB. Based on the
evaluation result, both new instances and learned
rules are ranked with a confidence value.
INPUT: initial seeds
1 i? 0 (iteration of bootstrapping)
2 seeds ? initial seeds
3 all instances ? {}
4 while (seeds 6= {})
5 rulesi ? getRules(seeds)
6 instancesi ? getInstances(rulesi)
7 new instancesi ? instancesi ? all instances

9 rank(new instancesi)
10 rank(rulesi)
11 seeds ? new instancesi
12 all instances ? all instances + new instancesi
13 i? i+ 1
OUTPUT: all instances
Algorithm 1: Extended DARE
4.3 Validation against cwDB
Given a cwDB of a target relation and its argValue
of its selected argument cwArg, the validation of
an extracted instance (inst) against the cwDB is
defined as follows.
inst correct ? inst ? cwDB (1)
inst wrong ? inst 6? cwDB ?
cwArg(inst) = argValue
inst unknown ? ( inst 6? cwDB ?
cwArg(inst) 6= argValue )
? ( inst 6? cwDB ?
cwArg(inst) is unspecified )
4.4 Rule Confidence Ranking with cwDB
We develop two rule-ranking strategies for con-
fidence estimation, in order to investigate the
best way of integrating the closed-world knowl-
edge: (a) exclusive ranking: This ranking strat-
egy excludes every rule which extracts wrong in-
stances after their validation against the closed-
world knowledge; (b) soft ranking: This ranking
strategy is built on top of the duality principle and
takes specificity and the depth of learning into ac-
count.
Exclusive Ranking The exclusive ranking
method is a very naive ranking method which
estimates the confidence value of a learned rule
(e.g., rule) depending on the truth value of its
extracted instances (getInstances(rule)) against
a cwDB. Any rule with one wrong extraction
is regarded as a bad rule in this method. This
method works effectively in a special scenario
where the total list of the instances of the target
relation is available as the cwDB.
confidence(rule) =
{
1 if getInstances(rule) ? cwDB,
0 otherwise. (2)
Soft Ranking The soft ranking method works
in the spirit of the ?Duality Principle?, the con-
fidence value of rules is dependent on the truth
value of their extracted instances and on the seed
instances from which they stem. The confi-
dence value of the extracted instances is estimated
based on their validation against the cwDB or the
confidence value of their ancestor seed instances
from which their extraction rules stem. Further-
more, the specificity of the instances (percentage
of the filled arguments) and the learning depth
(iteration step of bootstrapping) are parameters
too. The definition of instance scoring, namely,
score(inst), is given as follows:
score(inst) =
?
?
?
? > 0 if validate(inst , cwDB) = correct,
0 if validate(inst , cwDB) = wrong,
UN inst if validate(inst , cwDB) = unknown.
(3)
As defined above, if a new instance is con-
firmed as correct by the cwDB, it will obtain a
positive value. In our experiment, we set ?=10
in order to boost the precision. In the case of un-
known about its truth value, the confidence value
of a new instance (inst) is dependent on the confi-
dence values of the seed instances (ancestor seeds)
from which its mother rules (Rinst ) stem. Below,
the scoring of the unknown case, namely, UN inst ,
is defined, where Rinst are rules that extract the
new instance inst , while Irule are instances from
which a rule inRinst is learned and ? is the speci-
ficity value of inst while ? is utilized to express
the noisy potential of each further iteration during
bootstrapping.
1357
UN inst =
?
rule?Rinst
(?
j?Irule score(j)
|Irule | ? ?

)
|Rinst |
? ?
where
Rinst = getMotherRulesOf(inst),
Irule = getMotherInstancesOf(rule),
? = specificity,
? = 0.8,
irule = i-th iteration where rule occurs
(4)
Given the scoring of instance inst , the confidence
estimation of a rule is the average score of all
insts extracted by this rule:
confidence(rule) =
?
inst?I score(inst)
|I|
where I = getInstances(rule) (5)
5 Experiments
5.1 Corpora and Closed-World Knowledge
We conduct our experiments with two different
domains. We start with the Nobel Prize award do-
main reported in (Xu, 2007) and apply our method
to the same corpus, a collection from various on-
line newspapers. The target relation is the one
with the four arguments as mentioned in Sec-
tion 3. In this way, we can compare our results
with those reported in (Xu, 2007). Furthermore,
all Nobel Prize winners can be found from http:
//nobelprize.org, so it is easy to construct
a cwDB for Nobel Prize winners. We take the
PRIZE AREA as our selected argument for closing
sub-relations and construct various cwDBs with
the instantiation of this argument (e.g., all win-
ners of Nobel Peace Prize). The second domain
is about celebrities. Our text corpus is collected
from tabloid newspaper texts, containing 6850 ar-
ticles from the years 2001 and 2002. The target
relation is the marriage relationship between two
persons. We construct a cwDB of 289 persons in
which we have listed all their (ex-)spouses as well
as the time span of the marriage relation.
Table 1 summarizes the size of the corpus data
of the two domains.

5.2 Nobel Prize Domain
We apply the extended DARE system to the Nobel
Prize corpus at first and conduct two rule rank-
ing strategies with different sizes of the cwDB.
We conduct all our experiments with the seed
<Guenter Grass, Nobel, Literature, 1999>. The
DARE-Baseline performance is shown in Table 2.
Precision Absolute Recall
Baseline 77.98% 89.01%
Table 2: DARE-Baseline Performance
Exclusive Ranking
Given the complete list of Nobel Laureates, we
can apply the exclusive ranking strategy to this do-
main. Our cwDB is the total list of Nobel Prize
winners. The wrong instances will not be used as
seed for the next iteration. Rules that extracted
at least one wrong instance are marked as bad, the
other rules as good. We utilize only the good rules
for relation extraction.
Prec. Rel. Recall Rel. F-Measure
100.00% 82.88% 90.64%
Table 3: Performance of Exclusive Ranking in
Nobel Prize award domain.
In comparison to the DARE baseline system,
given the same seed setup, this experiment results
in a precision boost from 77.98% to 100% (see
Table 3). This is not surprising since the cwDB
covers all relation instances for the target rela-
tion. Nevertheless, this experiment shows that the
closed-world knowledge approach is effective to
exclude bad rules. However, the recall decreases
and is only 82.88% of the one of the baseline sys-
tem. As we explain above, not all rules extracting
wrong instances are bad rules because wrong ex-
tractions can also be caused by other error sources
such as named entity recognition. Therefore, even
good rules can be excluded because of other er-
ror sources. The exclusive ranking strategy is use-
ful for application scenarios where people want to
learn rules for achieving 100% precision perfor-
mance and do not expect high recall. It is espe-
cially effective when a big cwDB is available.
Soft Ranking
This ranking strategy does not exclude any
rules and assigns a score to each rule based on
1358
the definition in Section 4.4. Rules which extract
correct instances, more specific relation instances
and stem from high-scored seed instances obtain
a better value than others. In our approach, the
specificity is dependent on the number of the ar-
guments in the extracted instances. For this do-
main, the most specific instances contain all four
arguments. In the following, we conduct two ex-
periments with two different sizes of the cwDB:
1) with the total list of winners (complete cwDB)
and 2) with only winners in one PRIZE AREA (lim-
ited cwDB).
1) Complete closed-world database Figure 3
displays the correlation between the score of rules
and their extraction precision performance. Each
point stands for a set of rules with the same
score and extraction precision. In this setup, the
higher the score, the higher the precision. Given
the scored rules, Figure 4 depicts precision, re-
call and F-Measure for different score thresholds.
For a given threshold j we take all rules with
score(rule) ? j and use the instances they ex-
tract. The recall value here is the relative recall
w. r. t. to the DARE baseline performance: i. e. the
number of correct extracted instances divided by
the number of correct instances extracted by the
DARE baseline system. The F-Measure value is
calculated by using the relative recall values, we
therefore refer to it as the relative F-Measure. If
the system takes all rules with score ? 7, the sys-
tem achieves the best relative F-Measure.

the left upper corner. The reason is that many of
their extracted instances are unknown, even if their
extracted instances are mostly correct.
As shown in Figure 6, even with the limited
cwDB, the precision values are comparable with
the complete cwDB (see Figure 4). However, the
recall value drops much earlier than with the com-
plete cwDB. With a threshold of score 4, the sys-
tem achieves the best modified F-Measure 92,21%
with an improvement of precision of about 11 per-
centage points compared to the DARE baseline
system (89.39% vs. 77.98%). These results show
that even with a limited cwDB this ranking system
can help to improve the precision without loosing
too much recall.
We take a closer look on the useful (actively ex-
tracting) rules and their extraction performance,
using the same rule classification as (Xu, 2007).
As shown in Table 4, more than one fourth of
the extraction rules created by the baseline system
are dangerous ones and almost 15% are plainly
wrong. Applying the rule scoring with the limited
cwDB increases the fraction of good rules to al-
most three quarters and nearly eliminates all bad
rules at threshold 4. By choosing higher thresh-
olds, surviving good rules raises to 90%. The total
remaining set of rules then only consists of rules
that at least partially extract correct instances.
5.3 Celebrity Domain
As presented above, the soft ranking method de-
livers very promising result. In order to val-
idate this ranking method, we choose an ad-
ditional domain and decide to learn marriage
relations among celebrities, where the target
relation consists of the following arguments:
[ NAME OF SPOUSE, NAME OF SPOUSE, YEAR].
The value of the marriage year is valid when
the year is within the marriage time interval. The
motivation of selecting this target relation is the
large number of possible relations between two
persons leading to dangerous or even bad rules.
For example, the rule in Figure 7 is a very dan-
gerous rule because ?meeting? events of two mar-
ried celebrities are often reported. A good confi-
dence estimation method is very useful for boost-
ing the good rules like the one in Figure 8. From
our text corpus we extract 37.000 sentences that
mention at least two persons. The cwDB con-
sists of sample relation instances, in which one
NAME OF SPOUSE is instantiated, i. e. we manu-
ally construct a database which contains all (ex-)
spouses of 289 celebrities.

mod({head(("meet", VB)),
subj({head([SPOUSE<ne_person>])})})

aux({head(("be", VB))}),
dep({head([SPOUSE<ne_person>]),
dep({head([DATE<point>])})}),
nsubj({head([SPOUSE<ne_person>])})
Figure 8: Example of a positive rule
Since a gold standard of mentions for this cor-
pus is not available, we manually validate 100 ran-
dom samples from each threshold group. This
evaluation gives us an opportunity to estimate the
effect of a cwDB in this domain. Table 5 presents
the performance of the rules with different thresh-
olds. The precision value of the baseline system
is very low. Threshold 3 slightly improves the
precision of the DARE baseline without damag-
ing recall too much. Step 4 excludes dangerous
rules such as the one in Figure 7 which drastically
boosts the precision. Unfortunately, the exclusion
of such general rules leads to the loss of many cor-
rect relation instances too, therefore, the immense
drop of recall from threshold 3 to 4 as well as from
threshold 4 to 5. Positive extraction rules such as
Figure 8 are quite highly scored. Because of the
large number of rules and instances, we start the
quality analysis of rules with score 3. As the table
indicates, the use of the rule scoring in this domain
clearly improves the quality of the created extrac-
tion rules. The error analysis shows that the ma-
jor error resource for this domain is wrong coref-
erence resolution or identity resolution. For ex-

ample, the inability to distinguish Prince Charles
(former husband of British princess Diana) from
Charles Spencer (her brother) is the reason that
DARE crosses the border between the marriage
and the sibling relation. In comparison to the
Nobel Prize award event, the marriage relation
between persons is often used as additional in-
formation to a person which is involved in a re-
ported event. Therefore, anaphoric references oc-

6 Summary
We propose a new way in which prior knowledge
about domains can be efficiently used as addi-
tional criteria for confidence estimation of learned
new rules or new instances in a minimally su-
pervised machine learning framework. By intro-
ducing rule scoring on the basis of available do-
main knowledge (the cwDB), rules can be eval-
uated during the bootstrapping process with re-
spect to their extraction precision. The results
are rather promising. The rule score threshold is
an easy way for users of an extraction system to
adjust the precision-recall-trade-off to their own
needs. The rule estimation method is also general
enough to extend to integration of common sense
knowledge. Although the relation instances in
the closed-world knowledge database can also be
used as seed in the beginning, the core idea of our
research work is to develop a general confidence
estimation strategy for discovered new informa-
tion. As discussed in (Xu, 2007) and (Uszkoreit
et al, 2009), the size of seed is not always rele-
vant for the learning and extraction performance,
in particular if the data corpus exhibits the small
world property. Using all instances in the cwDB
as seed, our experiments with the baseline system
yield worse precision performance than the modi-
fied DARE algorithm with only one seed instance.
This approach is quite general and easily adapt-
able to many domains; the only prerequisite is
the existence of a database with relation instances
from the target domain with a fulfilled closed-
world property on some relational argument. A
database of this kind should be easily obtainable
for many domains, e. g. by exploiting structured
and semi-structured information sources in the In-
ternet, such as YAGO (Suchanek et al (2007)) and
DBpedia (Bizer et al (2009)). Furthermore, in
some areas, such as Business Intelligence, there
is nearly complete knowledge already present for
past years, while the task is to extract informa-
tion only from recent news articles. Construct-
ing closed-worlds out of the present knowledge to
improve the learning of new information is there-
fore a straightforward approach. Even the manual
collection of suitable data might be a reasonable
choice since appropriate closed worlds could be
rather small if cwDBis chosen properly.
