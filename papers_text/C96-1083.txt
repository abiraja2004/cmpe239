When trying to identify essential con- 
cepts and relationships in a medium-size 
corpus, it is not always possible to rely 
on statistical methods, as the frequencies 
are too low. We present an alternative 
method, symbolic, based on the simplifi- 
cation of parse trees. We discuss the re- 
suits on nominal phrases of two technical 
corpora, analyzed by two different robust 
parsers used for terminology updating in 
an industrial company. We compare our 
results with Hindle's scores of similarity.

1 Ident i fy ing  word  c lasses  in  
med ium-s ize  corpora  
In companies with a wide range of activities, such 
as EDF, the French electricity company, the rapid 
evolution of technical domains, the huge amount 
of textual data involved, its variation in length 
and style imply building or updating numerous 
terminologies as NLP resources. In this context, 
terminology acquisition is defined as a twofold 
process. On one hand, a terminologist must iden- 
tify the essential entities of the domain and their 
relationships, that is its ontology. On the other 
hand, (s)he must relate these entities and rela- 
tionships to their linguistic realizations, so as to 
isolate the lexical entries to be considered as cer- 
tified terms for the domain. 
In this paper, we concentrate on the first is- 
sue. Automatic exploration of a sublanguage cor- 
pus constitutes a first step towards identifying the 
semantic lasses and relationships which are rele- 
vant for this sublanguage. 
In the past five years, important research on the 
automatic acquisition of word classes based on lex- 
ical distribution has been published (Church and 
Hanks, 1990; Hindle, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Grei~n- 
stette, 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994). Most 
of these approaches, however, need large or even 
very large corpora in order for word classes to be 
discovered 1 whereas it is often the case that the 
data to be processed are insufficient to provide re- 
liable lexical intbrmation. In other words, it is not 
always possible to resort to statistical methods. 
On the other hand, medium size corpora (between 
100,000 and 500,000 words: typically a reference 
manual) are already too complex and too long to 
rely on reading only, even with concordances. For 
this range of corpora, a pure symbolic approach, 
which recycles and simplifies analyses produced 
by robust parsers in order to classify words, offers 
a viable alternative to statistical methods. We 
present his approach in section 2. Section 3 de- 
scribes the results on two technical corpora with 
two different robust parsers. Section 4 compares 
our results to Itindle's ones (Hindle, 1990). 
2 S impl i fy ing  parse  t rees  to  
c lass i fy  words  
2.1 The  need for normal i zed  syntact i c  
contexts  
As Hindle's work proves it, among others (Gr- 
ishman and Sterling, 1994; Grefenstette, 1994:), 
the mere existence of robust syntactic parsers 
makes it possible to parse large corpora in order 
to automate the discovery of syntactic patterns 
in the spirit of Harris's distributional hypothesis. 
Itowever, Harris' methodology implies also to sim- 
plify and transform each parse tree 2 , so as to ob- 
tain so-called "elementary sentences" exhibiting 
the main conceptual classes for the domain (Sager 
lIa'or instance, Hindle (Hindle, 1990) needs a six 
million word corpus in order to extract noun similari- 
ties from predicate-argunlent structures.

verb instead of a nominalization, and so on.

In order to ~mtomate this normalization, we 
propose to post-process parse trees so as to em- 
phasize the dependency relationships among the 
content words and to infer semantic lasses. Our 
approach can be opposed to the a prior one 
which consists in building simplified representa- 
tions while parsing (Basili et al, 1994; Metzler 
and Haas, 1989; Smeaton and Sheridan, 19911). 
2.2 R.ecycl ing the  resu l ts  of  robust  
parsers  
For the sake of reusability, we chose to add a 
generic post-processing treatment to the results of 
robust parsers. It ilnplies to transduce the trees 
resulting fl:om different parsers to a common for- 
n la t .  
We experimented so t~r two parsers: Aleth- 
(h:am and I,exl;er, which are being used at DER- 
EDI,' for terminology acquisition and updating. 
They both analyze corpora of arbitrary length. 
AlethGram has been developped winthin the 
GIIAAL project a. I,EXrI'ER has been developped 
at DER-EI)F (Bourigault, 1993). In this exper- 
inlent, we if)cussed on noun phrases, as they are 
central in most terminologies. 
2.3 The simplification algorithm 
The objective is then to reduce automatically the 
numerous and complex nominal phrases provided 
by AlethGram and LEXTEI{ to elementary trees, 
3The Eureka GRAAL project gathers in France 
(IC1-F, RLI (prime contractor), EDF, Aerospatiale and 
l{enanlt. 
which more readily exhibit the flmdamental bi- 
nary relations , and to classify words with respect 
to these simplified trees. 
For instance, from the parse tree for slenose 
serve de le tronc eommun gauche 4 (cf. fig. 2, in 
which non terminal nodes are indexed for refer- 
ence purposes), the algorithm 5 yields the set of 
elementary trees of figure 1. 'l'he trees a and c 
correspond to contiguous words in the original se- 
quence, whereas b and d only appear after modifier 
removal (see below). 
Two types of simplifications are applied when 
possible to a given tree: 
1. ,5'plitting: Each sub-tree immediately domi- 
nated by the root is extracted and possibly 
further simplified. For instance, removing 
node NP0 yields two sub-trees: NP\], which is 
elementary (see below) and PP2, which needs 
further simplification. 
2. Modifier removal: Within the whole tree, ev- 
ery phrase which represents a modified con- 
stituent is replaced by the corresponding non 
modified constituent. For example, in NP0, 
the adjectival modifier scrrc is removed, as 
well as the determiner and the adjectives 
4 Tight stcnosis of left common mainstem. In both 
parsers, {,he accents are removed during tile analy- 
sis, the lemmas are used instead of inflected fo,'ms. 
Additionally, fro' simplitication purposes, a contracted 
word like du is considered as a preposition- determiner 
sequ_enec.

tal,ion. The corresponding software, SYCI,AI)E, has

Figure 4: Polysemy of etude 
Last, relationships between concepts can be ex- 
tracted, such as the"part-of" relation between 
tronc and artere, and segment and artere (fig. 3). 
3.3 Distinguishing word meanings 
Polysemy and quasi-synonymy often makes the 
ontological reading of linguistic data difficult. 
However, through cliques and edge labels, the 
SYCLADE structured and documented map of 
the words helps to capture the word meaning level. 
Among a set of connected words where w is sim- 
ilar to wi and wj, cliques bring out coherent sub- 
sets where wi and wj are also similar to each other. 
We argue that the various cliques in which a word 
appears represent different axes of similarity and 
help to identify the different senses of that word. 
For instance, in the whole set of words connected 
to etude (study) in a strongly connected compo- 
nent of the NTC graph (analyse, evaluation, resul- 
tat, presentation, principe, calcul, travail...), some 
subsets form cliques with etude. Two of those 
cliques (resp. a and b in fig. 4 - threshold of 7) 
bring out a concrete and a more theoretical use of 
etude. 
The network also enables to distinguish the uses 
of quasi-synonyms such as eoronaire and coronar- 
ien in the CMC corpus. Even if they are among 
the most similar adjectives (7 shared contexts) 
and if they belong to the same clique {coronaire, 
eoronarien, diagonal, circonflexe}, the fact that 
eoronarien alone is connected to evaluation ad- 
jectives (severe, signifieatif and important) shows 
that they cannot always substitute to each other. 
4 Towards  an  adequate  s imi la r i ty  
es f imatat ion  fo r  the  bu i ld ing  o f  
onto log ies  
The comparison with the similarity score of (Hin- 
dle, 1990) shows that SYCLADE similarity in- 
dicator is specifically relevant for ontology boot- 
strap and tuning. Hindle uses the observed fre- 
quencies within a specific syntactic pattern (sub- 
ject/verb, and verb/object) to derive a cooccu,> 
rence score which is an estimate of mutual infor- 
mation (Church and Hanks, 1990). We adapted 
this score to noun phrase patterns)  However the 
similarity measures based on cooccurrence scores 
and nominal phrase patterns are less relevant for 
an ontological analysis. The subgraph of the 
chirurgical acts words, which is easy to identify 
from the SYCLADE graph (fig. 5a), is split in dif- 
ferent parts in the similarity graph (fig. 5b). This 
difference stems from the fact that this cooccur- 
rence score overestimates rare events and under- 
lines the collocations pecific to each form. 1? For 
instance, it appears that the relationship between 
stenose and lesion, which was central in figure 
3, with 8 shared contexts, almost diseappears if
one considers the number of shared cooccurrences. 
Therefore, similarity measures based on cooccur- 
rences and similarity estimation based on shared 
contexts must not be used in place of each other. 
As opposed to Hindle's lists of similar words 
which are centered on pivot words whose neigh- 
bors are all on the same level, in SYCLADE 
graphs, a word is represented by its role in a whole 
syntactic and conceptual network. The graph en- 
ables to distinguish the various meanings of words, 
a crucial feature in the ontological perspective 
since the meaning level is closer to the concept 
level than the word level. In addition, the results 
are clear and more easily interpretable than those 
given by a statistical method, because the reader 
does not have to supply the explanation as to why 
and how the words are similar. 
The building of an ontology, which is a time- 
consuming task and which cannot be achieved 
automatically, can nevertheless be guided. The 
SYCLADE graphs based on shared contexts can 
facilitate this process. 
9For instance, for Na PN2 
CoocNi,N~ : log 2 ~ ~  
where f(NIPN2) is the fi'equency of noun N1 occur- 
ring with N2 in a noun preposition pattern, f(N1) is 
the frequency of NI as head of any N1PN,~ sequence 
and f(N2) the frequency of N2 in modifier/argument 
position of auy N~PN2 sequence and k is the count 
of NxPN v elementary trees in the corpus. COOCNAda 
and CooeAd~N are similarly defined. 
1?The various cooccurrence scores retrieve sets of 
collocations which are sharply different fi'om the con- 
texts shown by SYCLADE connected components. 
The coll6cations which get the greatest cooccurrence 
scores eem to characterize medecine phraseology (fac- 
teur (de) risque, milieu hospitalier) but not the coro- 
nary diseases as such.
