People ta lk  ?bout what they do, often ? t  the same 
tame a? they are doing. This reporting has ?n 
important function in coordinat ing aotlon between 
people working together on real eve~/day problems. Zt 
is also ?n important acts'ca o? data for social 
scientists sttu~ylng people's behavior. Xn this paper, 
we report on some ?tudle? we are doing on report 
dialogues. We describe two kinds of phenomena we have 
ident i f ied ,  outl ine a preliminary process model that 
in t ?g ra t ? ?  the report generation with the processes 
that are generating the actions being reported upon, 
and spec i fy  a systemat ic  methodology For ext rac t ing  
relevant evidence bearing on these phenomena t~om text 
trenscrlpts of talk about doing to use in evaluating 
the model.

Reports of  problm solving actions are often used a? 
evident?  about the und?rlying cognit ive processes 
involved in generating a problem solution, as "problem 
solving protocols"  (Howell & Simon, 1972). However, 
these reports ere obviously a kind of language 
interact ion in the i r  own r ight ,  in which the subject i ?  
reportlns on hls/hor own actions to the experimenter. 
We have analyzed problem solving protocols of people 
solving a puzzle called "Hlsslonaries and Cannibals" 
and have found that  in the i r  repor t ? ,  people adopt ? 
? point or view" with respect to the problan, through ? 
con?latent use of spat ia l  detxts, For example, when a 
subject lays: 
" . . ,  X can't send another cannibal across with 
another alssioflary or he w i l l  he outnumbered when he 
gets to the other side . . ,  " 
the deix is  In her report places her as speaker off the 
? from" side of the considered action, This is  
indicated both by the choice of the verb "send" and by 
the description of "the other side". ?he same suhjeot 
indicated the "to n slde as her point or view in another 
part or her protocol:  
" , . . ' cause  you've gotta have one person to h r i~  
back the boat . . . "  4 
Here, both the verb "br ing" and the adverb "back" 
indicate "point ot  view". 
Although people almost always unmmbiguoualy 
specify ? "point of  view" within the problem they are 
solving in thei r  reports, they also deny awareness of 
takAn| such ? point cF view, However, th is  point or 
view is important to the underlying problem solving 
procesmas. The strongest evidence for this  comes ~om 
the hi |h correlat ion ~etween Point or view and errors 
in problem solv ing actions. Subjects in the 
~tlsslonarles and Cannibals task can make er rors  by 
Cabin| act ions  that  v io late  the const ra in ts  or the 
task. Host of these errors  occur on the side away f rm 
their  current "point s t  view", even theuah the i r  point 
of view changes From one physical side to the other 
during the course or solving the pun le ,  mre 
interest ing is  that most of the "undetected" errors 
emcur on the side ?way from their  point or view. Some 
errors arm spontaneously detected by the subject 
~mmediately otter askant the action that leads to ? 
violation! others ere "undetected". After the 
experimenter interrupts topo ln t  out these undetected 
errors, the subjects often switch point of view so that  
the v io la t ion  condition is  now on the same side a? the 
subjects' point of view. 
We see the point of view indicated by ?patlal 
delxls In the report of problem solving as reflec~ir~ 
an underlying allocation of effort (or attention). Pew 
errors occur with problem elements that ?re given 
processing effort, while constraints that ?re given 
little attention are more often violated. 
%n this way, these reports are reflecting changes Zn 
the organization of the problem element? that occur 
over the course of reaching a solution. We have also 
ident i f ied other ways in which report ?  embody the use 
of d i f ferent  conceptual organizations of the problem, 
inc luding org ?n l za t lons  that  vary from abst rac t  to 
concrete and from perception oriented to action 
oriented. 
JUSTZrZCATZON~~ 
There ?re multi-utterance structures that occur 
regular ly  in problem solving ta lk  that we ca l l  
? justltAoatlon argument structures." These structures 
have the form of: 
(did ) (do ) (since ) 
(could)+(not do)+(aot ion) . (bsc ?use)->(Just i t loat lon 
(w i l l )  argument) 
(A l ternat ive ly ,  these two segments san he reversed in 
order, by using connectiv?s l i ke  "theretora" or "so".)  
For example, these kinds of  dialogue units occur in 
many ot the protocols studied by Newall & Simon (1972): 
"hen  letter has one and only one numerical value 
,e .  
'(\[: One numerical value.) There are ten different 
letters and each of them has one numerloal value. 
Therefore, Z san, iooklng at the Wo D's each D is 
5; therefore, T is zero." (Hewell& 8Amen, 
1972:230-231) 
Zn studying our problem solving protocols tram the 
~tseionarles and Cannibals puzzle, we have Identltied 
several kinds of argument structures, depending on what 
kinds of problem solving approach ??oh subject took to 
the problem at each point An time. For example, one 
common justification argument structure is the 
? elimination cf alternative?" struntur?: All av?Llabte 
aotlons A. From this state except A i can be ruled cut. 
Therefore-do actlon A i, Here is an-example of this 
Mind of argument struSture: 
? ... %f Z put a cannibal on, then he gee? hack and 
the guys on the other side of the river, the 
misslcnary, is outnumbered and he will be eaten. 
Zt % put on . . . .  th is  is a l l  my oonbinatioa? and 
permutation? . . . .  2t Z put ton mission?flea on, Z 
wan two cannibal ?  on the boat and send them back, 
then At As Just  r id lcu lou ?  ? t  the other  end . . . .  
so what %'11 have to do As one ot eenh." 
Another argument rcrm Is one we call "prapat io  
ark,sent". (We have borrowed many or our naaes for

"point of view" for a problem solver at each point in 
the problem solving from a record of the problem 
solving report and a record of moves made. Then, we 
use this extracted trace to evaluate our model of the 
role of point of view in problem solving. 
SUMMARY 
We have reported here a three pronged approach to 
the study of problem solving action and report: I) the 
collected of data on problem solving and talk about 
problem solving, 2) development of a process model of 
these behaviors, and 3) use of coding techniques to 
extract traces of "critical phenomena" from the 
transcripts for evaluating the model. So far, we have 
focussed our efforts on two types of problem solving 
phenomena: the changes in the problem solver's 
organization of the problem ("point of view"), and 
systematic multl-utterance structures used to express 
the forms of inference used to solve the problem 
("Justificatlon argument structures").
