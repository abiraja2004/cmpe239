Abstract 
The correct interpretation of biomedical texts 
by text mining systems requires the recogni-
tion of a range of types of high-level informa-
tion (or meta-knowledge) about the text. Ex-
amples include expressions of negation and 
speculation, as well as pragmatic/rhetorical in-
tent (e.g. whether the information expressed 
represents a hypothesis, generally accepted 
knowledge, new experimental knowledge, 
etc.) Although such types of information have 
previously been annotated at the text-span 
level (most commonly sentences), annotation 
at the level of the event is currently quite 
sparse. In this paper, we focus on the evalua-
tion of the multi-dimensional annotation 
scheme that we have developed specifically 
for enriching bio-events with meta-knowledge 
information. Our annotation scheme is in-
tended to be general enough to allow integra-
tion with different types of bio-event annota-
tion, whilst being detailed enough to capture 
important subtleties in the nature of the meta-
knowledge expressed in the text. To our 
knowledge, our scheme is unique within the 
field with regards to the diversity of meta-
knowledge aspects annotated for each event, 
whilst the evaluation results have confirmed 
its feasibility and soundness.  
1 Introduction 
The ability to recognise high-level information 
(or meta-knowledge) relating to the interpreta-
tion of texts is an important task for text mining 
systems. There are several types of meta-
knowledge that fall under this category. For ex-
ample, the detection of expressions of specula-
tion and negation is important across all do-
mains, although the way in which these phenom-
ena are expressed may be domain-specific. In 
scientific texts, it is also important to be able to 
determine other types of information, such as the 
author?s rhetorical/pragmatic intent (de Waard et 
al., 2009). This would correspond to whether the 
information expressed represents a hypothesis, 
accepted knowledge, new experimental knowl-
edge, etc.  
The ability to distinguish between these dif-
ferent types of information can be important for 
tasks such as  building and updating models of 
biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al, 
2008), and curation of biological databases 
(Ashburner et al, 2000). Central to both of these 
tasks is the identification of new knowledge that 
can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon 
an existing, but incomplete model of a biological 
process (Lisacek et al, 2005) or to ensure that 
the database is kept up to date. Any new knowl-
edge added should be supported though evi-
dence, which could include linking hypotheses 
with experimental findings. It is also important to 
take into account inconsistencies and contradic-
tions reported in the literature. 
The production of annotated corpora can help 
to train text mining systems to recognise types of 
meta-knowledge, such as the above. Although a 
number of such corpora have already been pro-
duced, different annotation schemes are required 
according to the exact domain under considera-
tion, as well as the types of task that will be un-
dertaken by the text mining system.  
The work described in this paper is focused on 
the design and evaluation of the meta-knowledge 
annotation scheme described in Nawaz et al, 
(2010). The annotation scheme has been specifi-
cally designed to recognise a range of meta-
knowledge types for events extracted from bio-
medical texts (henceforth bio-events). The aim is 
to facilitate the development of more useful sys-
tems in the context of various biomedical infor-
mation extraction (IE) and textual inference (TI) 
tasks. Although the scheme has been designed 
69
for application to existing bio-event corpora, it is 
intended to be applied to any type of bio-relation 
corpora, and can easily be tailored for other types 
of relations/events within the domain. 
1.1  Bio-Event Representation of Text 
Searching for relevant information in electronic 
documents is most commonly carried out by en-
tering keywords into a search engine. However, 
such searches will normally return a huge num-
ber of documents, many of which will be irrele-
vant to the user?s needs.  
A more promising and efficient way of search-
ing is over events that have been extracted from 
texts through the application of natural language 
processing methods. An event is a structured rep-
resentation of a certain piece of information con-
tained within the text, which is usually anchored 
to a particular word in the text (typically a verb 
or noun) that is central to the description of the 
event. Events are often represented by a tem-
plate-like structure with slots that are filled by 
the event participants. Each event participant is 
also assigned a role within the event. These par-
ticipants can be entities, concepts or even other 
events. This kind of event representation allows 
the information contained in a text to be repre-
sented as a collection of nested events.  
A bio-event is an event specialised for the 
biomedical domain. Kim et al (2008) define a 
bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation involving 
one or more participants. These participants can 
be bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are each 
assigned a semantic role/slot like theme and 
cause etc. Each bio-event is typically assigned a 
type/class from a chosen bio-event taxon-
omy/ontology, e.g., the GENIA Event Ontology 
(Kim et al, 2008). Similarly, the bio-entities are 
also assigned types/classes from a chosen bio-
term taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the Gene Ontol-
ogy (Ashburner et al, 2000). 
As an example, consider the simple sentence 
shown in Figure 1. 
This sentence contains a single bio-event, an-
chored to the verb activates. Figure 2 shows a 
typical structured representation of this bio-
event. 
The fact that the verb is anchored to the verb 
activates allows the event-type of positive regu-
lation to be assigned. The event has two slots, 
i.e. theme and cause whose labels help to charac-
terise the contribution that the slot filler makes 
towards the meaning of the event. In this case, 
the slots are filled by the subject and object of 
the verb activates, both of which correspond to 
different types of bio-entities (i.e. operon and 
protein).  
IE systems trained to extract bio-events from 
texts allow users to formulate semantic queries 
over the extracted events. Such queries can  
specify semantic restrictions on the events in 
terms of event types, semantic role labels and 
named entity types etc. (Miyao et al, 2006), in 
addition to particular keywords. For example, it 
would be possible to search only for those texts 
containing bio-events of type nega-
tive_regulation where the cause is an entity of 
type protein. Such queries provide a great deal 
more descriptive power than traditional keyword 
searches over unstructured documents.  Bio-
medical corpora that have been manually anno-
tated with event level information (e.g., Pyysalo 
et al, 2007; Kim et al, 2008; Thompson et al, 
2009) facilitate the training of systems such as 
those described above.  
Whilst event-based querying has advantages 
for efficient searching, the extracted events have 
little practical use if they are not accompanied by 
meta-knowledge information to aid in their inter-
pretation.  
1.2 Existing Meta-knowledge Annotation 
Various corpora of biomedical literature (ab-
stracts and/or full papers) have been produced 
that feature some degree of meta-knowledge an-
notation. These corpora vary in both the richness 
of the annotation added, and the type/size of the 
units at which the meta-knowledge annotation 
has been performed. Taking the unit of annota-
tion into account, we can distinguish between 
annotations that apply to continuous text-spans, 
and annotations that have been performed at the 
event level. 
Text-Span Annotation: Such annotations have 
mostly been carried out at the sentence level. 
They normally concentrate on a single aspect (or

activates the nitrate reductase operon.

dimension) of meta-knowledge, normally either 
speculation/certainty level, (e.g., Light et al, 
2004; Medlock & Briscoe, 2007; Vincze et al, 
2008) or general information content/rhetorical 
intent, e.g., background, methods, results, in-
sights. This latter type of annotation has been 
attempted both on abstracts, (e.g., McKnight & 
Srinivasan, 2003; Ruch et al, 2007) and full pa-
pers, (e.g. Teufel et al, 1999; Langer et al, 2004; 
Mizuta & Collier, 2004), with the number of dis-
tinct annotation categories varying between 4 
and 14.  
Despite the availability of these corpora, anno-
tation at the sentence level can often be too 
granular. In terms of information content, a sen-
tence may describe, for example, both an ex-
perimental method and its results. The situation 
becomes more complicated if a sentence contains 
an expression of speculation. If this is only 
marked at the sentence level, there may be con-
fusion about which part(s) of the sentence are 
affected by the speculative expression.  
Certain corpora and associated systems have 
attempted to address these issues. The BioScope 
corpus (Vincze et al, 2008) annotates the scopes 
of negative and speculative keywords, whilst 
Morante & Daelemans (2009) have trained a sys-
tem to undertake this task. The scheme described 
by Wilbur et al (2006) applies annotation to 
fragments of sentences, which are created on the 
basis of changes in the meta-knowledge ex-
pressed. The scheme consists of multiple annota-
tion dimensions which capture aspects of both 
certainty and rhetorical/pragmatic intent, 
amongst other things. Training a system to auto-
matically annotate these dimensions is shown to 
be highly feasible (Shatkay et al, 2008). 
Event-Level Annotation: Explicit annotation of 
meta-knowledge at the event-level is currently 
rather minimal within biomedical corpora. 
Whilst several corpora contain annotations to 
distinguish positive and negative events (e.g. 
Sanchez-Graillet & Poesio, 2007; Pyysalo et al, 
2007), the annotation of the GENIA Event Cor-
pus (Kim et al, 2008) is slightly more extensive, 
in that it additionally annotates certainty level. 
To our knowledge, no existing bio-event corpus 
has attempted annotation that concerns rhetori-
cal/pragmatic intent.  
 
1.3 The Need for an Event-Centric Meta-
Knowledge Annotation Scheme 
In comparison to meta-knowledge annotation 
carried out at the text-span level, the amount of 
annotation carried out at the event level is quite 
sparse. The question thus arises as to whether it 
is possible to use systems trained on text-span 
annotated corpora to assign meta-knowledge to 
bio-events, or whether new annotation at the 
event level is required.  
Some corpora seem better suited to this pur-
pose than others ? whilst sentence-level annota-
tions are certainly too granular for an event-
centric view of the text, sentence fragments, such 
as those identified by Wilbur et al (2006), are 
likely to correspond more closely to the extent of 
text that describes an event and its slots. Like-
wise, knowing the scopes of negative and specu-
lative keywords within a sentence may be a use-
ful aid in determining whether they affect the 
interpretation of a particular event.   
However, the information provided in these 
corpora is still not sufficiently precise for event-
level meta-knowledge annotation. Even within a 
text fragment, there may be several different bio-
events, each with slightly different meta-
knowledge interpretations. In a similar way, not 
all events that occur within the scope of a nega-
tion or speculation keyword are necessarily af-
fected by it.  
  Based on these observations, we have devel-
oped a meta-knowledge annotation scheme that 
is specifically tailored to bio-events. Our scheme 
annotates various different aspects or dimensions 
of meta-knowledge. A close examination of a 
large number of relevant bio-events has resulted 
in a scheme that has some similarities to previ-
ously proposed schemes, but has a number of 
differences that seem especially relevant when 
dealing with events, e.g. the annotation of the 
manner of the event. The scheme is intended to 
be general enough to allow integration with ex-
isting bio-event annotation schemes, whilst being 
detailed enough to capture important subtleties in 
the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed 
about the event.  
1.4 Lexical Markers of Meta-Knowledge 
Most of the existing corpora mentioned above 
annotate text spans or events with particular 
categories (e.g. certainty level or general infor-
mation type) in different meta-knowledge di-
mensions. However, what they do not normally 
do is to annotate lexical clues or keywords used 
to determine the correct values.  
A number of previous studies have demon-
strated the importance of lexical markers (i.e., 
words or phrases) that can accompany statements 
in scientific articles in determining the intended 
71
interpretation of the text (e.g. Hyland, 1996; Ri-
zomilioti 2006). We also performed a similar 
study (Thompson et al, 2008) although, in con-
trast to other studies, we took a multi-
dimensional approach to the categorisation of 
such lexical items, acknowledging that several 
types of important information may be expressed 
through different words in the same sentence. As 
an example, let us consider the example sentence 
in Figure 3.  
The author?s pragmatic/rhetorical intent to-
wards the statement that the catalytic role of 
these side chains is associated with their interac-
tion with the DNA substrate is encoded by the 
word indicate, which shows that the statement 
represents an analysis of the evidence stated at 
the beginning of the sentence, i.e., that the muta-
tions at positions 849 and 668 have DNA-
binding properties. Furthermore, the author?s 
certainty level (i.e., their degree of confidence) 
towards this analysis is shown by the word may. 
Here, the author is uncertain about the validity of 
their analysis. 
Whilst our previous work served to demon-
strate that the different aspects of meta-
knowledge that can be specified lexically within 
texts require a multi-dimensional analysis to cor-
rectly capture their subtleties, it showed that the 
presence of particular lexical items is not the 
only important feature for determining meta-
knowledge categories. In particular, their pres-
ence does not guarantee that the ?expected? in-
terpretation can be assumed (S?ndor, 2007). In 
addition, not all types of meta-knowledge are 
indicated through explicit markers. Mizuta & 
Collier (2004) note that  rhetorical zones may be 
indicated not only through explicit lexical mark-
ers, but also through features such as the main 
verb in the clause and the position of the sen-
tence within the article or abstract. 
For these reasons, we perform annotation on 
all relevant instances, regardless of the presence 
of lexical markers. This will allow systems to be 
trained that can learn to determine the correct 
meta-knowledge category, even when lexical 
markers are not present. However, due to the 
proven importance of lexical markers in deter-
mining certain meta-knowledge dimensions, our 
annotation scheme annotates such markers, 
whenever they are present. 
2 Annotation Scheme 
The annotation scheme we present here is a 
slightly modified version of our original meta-
knowledge annotation scheme (Nawaz et al, 
2010). The modified scheme consists of five 
meta-knowledge dimensions, each with a set of 
complete and mutually-exclusive categories, i.e., 
any given bio-event belongs to exactly one cate-
gory in each dimension. Our chosen set of anno-
tation dimensions has been motivated by the 
major information needs of biologists discussed 
earlier, i.e., the ability to distinguish between 
different intended interpretations of events. 
In order to minimise the annotation burden, 
the number of possible categories within each 
dimension has been kept as small as possible, 
whilst still respecting important distinctions in 
meta-knowledge that have been observed during 
our corpus study.     
The advantage of using a multi-dimensional 
scheme is that the interplay between different 
values of each dimension can reveal both subtle 
and substantial differences in the types of meta-
knowledge expressed in the surrounding text. 
Therefore, in most cases, the exact rhetori-
cal/pragmatic intent of an event can only be de-
termined by considering a combination of the 
values of different dimensions. This aspect of our 
scheme is further discussed in section 3. 
 
Figure 4 provides an overview of the annota-
tion scheme. The boxes with the light-coloured 
(grey) background correspond to information 
that is common to most bio-event annotation 
schemes, i.e., the participants in the event, to-
gether with an indication of the class or type of

the event. The boxes with the darker (green) 
backgrounds correspond to our proposed meta-
knowledge annotation dimensions and their pos-
sible values. The remainder of this section pro-
vides brief details of each annotation dimension.  
2.1 Knowledge Type (KT) 
This dimension is responsible for capturing the 
general information content of the event. Whilst 
less detailed than some of the previously pro-
posed sentence-level schemes, its purpose is to 
form the basis of distinguishing between the 
most critical types of rhetorical/pragmatic intent, 
according to the needs of biologists. Each event 
is thus classified into one of the following four 
categories: 
Investigation: Enquiries or investigations, which 
have either already been conducted or are 
planned for the future, typically marked by lexi-
cal clues like examined, investigated and studied, 
etc.  
Observation: Direct observations, often repre-
sented by lexical clues like found, observed and 
report, etc.  Simple past tense sentences typically 
also describe observations. Such events represent 
experimental knowledge.  
Analysis: Inferences, interpretations, specula-
tions or other types of cognitive analysis, typi-
cally expressed by lexical clues like suggest, in-
dicate, therefore and conclude etc. Such events, 
if they are interpretations or reliable inferences 
based on experimental results, can also constitute 
another type of (indirect) experimental knowl-
edge. Weaker inferences or speculations, how-
ever, may be considered as hypotheses which 
need further proof through experiments.  
General: Scientific facts, processes, states or 
methodology. This is the default category for the 
knowledge type dimension. 
2.2 Certainty Level (CL) 
The value of this dimension is almost always 
indicated through the presence/absence of an ex-
plicit lexical marker. In scientific literature, it is 
normally only applicable to events whose KT 
corresponds either to Analysis or General. In the 
case of Analysis events, CL encodes confidence 
in the truth of the event, whilst for General 
events, there is a temporal aspect, to account for 
cases where a particular process is explicitly 
stated to occur most (but not all) of the time, us-
ing a marker such as normally, or only occasion-
ally, using a marker like sometimes.  Events cor-
responding to direct Observations are not open to 
judgements of certainty, nor are Investigation 
events, which refer to things which have not yet 
happened or have not been verified.  
Regarding the choice of values for the CL di-
mension, there is an ongoing discussion as to 
whether it is possible to partition the epistemic 
scale into discrete categories (Rubin, 2007). 
However, the use of a number of distinct catego-
ries is undoubtedly easier for annotation pur-
poses and has been proposed in a number of pre-
vious schemes. Although recent work has sug-
gested the use of  four or more categories (Shat-
kay et al, 2008; Thompson et al, 2008), our ini-
tial analysis of bio-event corpora has shown that 
only three levels of certainty seem readily distin-
guishable for bio-events. This is in line with 
Hoye (1997), whose analysis of general English 
showed that there are at least three articulated 
points on the epistemic scale.  
We have chosen to use numerical values for 
this dimension, in order to reduce potential anno-
tator confusions or biases that may be introduced 
through the use of labels corresponding to par-
ticular lexical markers of each category, such as 
probable or possible, and also to account for the 
fact that slightly different interpretations apply to 
the different levels, according to whether the 
event has a KT value of Analysis or General.  
L3: No expression of uncertainty or speculation 
(default category)  
L2: High confidence or slight speculation.  
L1: Low confidence or considerable speculation; 
typical lexical markers include may, might and 
perhaps.  
2.3 Source 
The source of experimental evidence provides 
important information for biologists. This is 
demonstrated by its annotation during the crea-
tion of the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al, 
2000) and in the corpus created by Wilbur et al 
(2006). The Source dimension can also help in 
distinguishing new experimental knowledge 
from previously reported knowledge. Our 
scheme distinguishes two categories, namely: 
Other: The event is attributed to a previous 
study. In this case, explicit clues (citations or 
phrases like previous studies etc.) are normally 
present. 
Current: The event makes an assertion that can 
be (explicitly or implicitly) attributed to the cur-
rent study. This is the default category, and is 
assigned in the absence of explicit lexical or con-
textual clues. 
73
2.4 Polarity 
This dimension identifies negated events. Al-
though certain bio-event corpora are annotated 
with this information, it is still missing from oth-
ers. The indication of whether an event is ne-
gated is vital, as the interpretation of a negated 
event instance is completely opposite to the in-
terpretation of a non-negated (positive) instance 
of the same event.  
We define negation as the absence or non-
existence of an entity or a process. Negation is 
typically expressed by the adverbial not and the 
nominal no. However, other lexical devices like 
negative affixals (un- and in-, etc.), restrictive 
verbs (fail, lack, and unable, etc.), restrictive 
nouns (exception, etc.), certain adjectives (inde-
pendent, etc.), and certain adverbs (without, etc.) 
can also be used. 
2.5 Manner 
Events may be accompanied by a word or phrase 
which provides an indication of the rate, level, 
strength or intensity of the interaction. We refer 
to this as the Manner of the event. Information 
regarding manner is absent from the majority of 
existing bio-event corpora, but yet the presence 
of such words can be significant in the correct 
interpretation of the event. Our scheme distin-
guishes 3 categories of Manner, namely:  
High: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjec-
tives like strongly, rapidly and high, etc.  
Low: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjec-
tives like weakly, slightly and slow, etc.  
Neutral: Default category assigned to all events 
without an explicit indication of manner. 
3 Hyper-Dimensions 
Determining the pragmatic/rhetorical intent be-
hind an event is not completely possible using 
any one of our explicitly annotated dimensions. 
Although the Knowledge Type value forms the 
basis for this, it is not in itself sufficient. How-
ever, a defining feature of our annotation scheme 
is that additional information can be inferred by 
considering combinations of some of the explic-
itly annotated dimensions. We refer to this addi-
tional information as ?latent? or ?hyper? dimen-
sions of our scheme. We have identified two 
such hyper-dimensions. 
3.1 New Knowledge 
The isolation of events describing new knowl-
edge can be important in certain tasks undertaken 
by biologists, as explained earlier. Events with 
the Knowledge Type of Observation could corre-
spond to new knowledge, but only if they repre-
sent observations from the current study, rather 
than observations cited from elsewhere. In a 
similar way, an Analysis drawn from experimen-
tal results in the current study could be treated as 
new knowledge, but generally only if it repre-
sents a straightforward interpretation of results, 
rather than something more speculative.  
 Hence, we consider New Knowledge to be a 
hyper-dimension of our scheme. Its value (either 
Yes or No) is inferred by considering a combina-
tion of the value assignments for the KT, Source 
and CL dimensions.  
Table 1 shows the inference table that can be 
used to obtain the value for the New Knowledge 
hyper-dimension from the assigned values of the 
Source, KT and CL dimensions. The symbol ?X? 
indicates a ?don?t care condition?, meaning that 
this value does not have any impact on the result.

3.2 Hypothesis 
A further hyper-dimension of our scheme is Hy-
pothesis. The binary value of this hyper-
dimension can be inferred by considering the 
values of KT and CL. Events with a KT value of 
Investigation can always be assumed to be a hy-
pothesis, However, if the KT value is Analysis, 
then only those events with a CL value of L1 or 
L2 (speculative inferences made on the basis of 
results) should be considered as hypothesis, to be 
matched with more definite experimental evi-
dence when available. A value of L3 in this in-
stance would normally be classed as new knowl-
edge, as explained in the previous section.

used to get the value for the Hypothesis hyper-
dimension.

4 Evaluation 
The annotation scheme has been evaluated 
through a small annotation experiment. We ran-
domly choose 70 abstracts from the GENIA 
Pathway Corpus, which collectively contain over 
2600 annotated bio-events. Two of the authors 
independently annotated these bio-events using a 
set of annotation guidelines. These guidelines 
were developed following an analysis of the 
various bio-event corpora and the output of the 
initial case study (Nawaz et al, 2010). 
The highly favourable results of this experi-
ment further confirmed the feasibility and 
soundness of the annotation scheme. The re-
mainder of this section discusses the results in 
more detail. 
 
Dimension Cohen?s Kappa 
Knowledge Type 0.9017 
Certainty Level 0.9329 
Polarity 0.9059 
Manner 0.8944 
Source 0.9520 
Table 3. Inter-Annotator Agreement 
4.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement 
We have used the familiar measure of Cohen?s 
kappa (Cohen, 1960) for assessing the quality of 
annotation. Table 3 shows the kappa values for 
each annotated dimension. The highest value of 
kappa was achieved for the Source dimension, 
while the KT dimension yielded the lowest kappa 
value. Nevertheless, the kappa scores for all an-
notation dimensions were in the good region 
(Krippendorff, 1980).  
4.2 Category Distribution 
Knowledge Type:  The most prevalent category 
found in this dimension was Observation, with 
45% of all annotated events belonging to this 
category. Only a small fraction (4%) of these 
events was represented by an explicit lexical clue 
(mostly sensory verbs).  In most cases the tense, 
local context (position within the sentence) or 
global context (position within the document) 
were found to be important factors. 
The second most common category (37% of 
all annotated events) was General. We discov-
ered that most (64%) of the events belonging to 
this category were processes or states embedded 
in noun phrases (such as c-fos expression). More 
than a fifth of the General events (22%) ex-
pressed known scientific facts, whilst a smaller 
fraction (14%) expressed experimental/scientific 
methods (such as stimulation and incubation 
etc.). Explicit lexical clues were found only for 
facts, and even then in only 1% of cases. 
Analysis was the third most common category, 
comprising 16% of all annotated events. Of the 
events belonging to this category, 44% were de-
ductions (CL=L1), whilst the remaining 54% 
were hedged interpretations (CL=L2/L3). All 
Analysis events were marked with explicit lexical 
clues. 
The least common category was Investigation 
(1.5% of all annotated events). All Investigation 
events were marked with explicit lexical clues. 
Certainty Level: L3 was found to be the most 
prevalent category, corresponding to 93% of all 
events. The categories L2 and L1 occurred with 
frequencies of 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. The 
relative scarcity of speculative sentences in sci-
entific literature is a well documented phenome-
non (Thompson et al, 2008; Vincze et al, 2008). 
Vincze et al (2008) found that less than 18% of 
sentences occurring in biomedical abstracts are 
speculative. Similarly, we found that around 20% 
of corpus events belong to speculative sentences. 
Since speculative sentences contain non-
speculative events as well, the frequency of 
speculative events is expected to be much less 
than the frequency of speculative sentences. In 
accordance with this hypothesis, we found that 
only 7% of corpus events were expressed with 
some degree of speculation. We also found that 
almost all speculated events had explicit lexical 
clues.  
Polarity:  Our event-centric view of negation 
showed just above 3% of the events to be ne-
gated. Similarly to speculation, the expected fre-
75
quency of negated events is lower than the fre-
quency of negated sentences. Another reason for 
finding fewer negated events is the fact that, in 
contrast to previous schemes, we draw a distinc-
tion between events that are negated and events 
expressed with Low manner. For example, cer-
tain words like limited and barely are often con-
sidered as negation clues. However, we consider 
them as clues for Low manner. In all cases, nega-
tion was expressed through explicit lexical clues. 
Manner: Whilst only a small fraction (4%) of 
events contains an indication of Manner, we 
found that where present, manner conveys vital 
information about the event. Our results also re-
vealed that indications of High manner are three 
times more frequent than the indications of Low 
manner. We also noted that both High and Low 
manners were always indicated through the use 
of explicit clues. 
Source: Most (99%) of the events were found to 
be of the Current category. This is to be ex-
pected, as authors tend to focus on current work 
in within abstracts. It is envisaged, however, that 
this dimension will be more useful for analyzing 
full papers. 
Hyper-dimensions: Using the inference tables 
shown in section 3, we calculated that almost 
57% of the events represent New Knowledge, and 
just above 8% represent Hypotheses.  
5 Conclusion and Future Work 
We have evaluated a slightly modified version of 
our meta-knowledge annotation scheme for bio-
events, first presented in Nawaz et al (2010). 
The scheme captures key information regarding 
the correct interpretation of bio-events, which is 
not currently annotated in existing bio-event cor-
pora, but which we have shown to be critical in a 
number of text mining tasks undertaken by bi-
ologists. The evaluation results have shown high 
inter-annotator agreement and a sufficient num-
ber of annotations along each category in every 
dimension. These results have served to confirm 
the feasibility and soundness of the annotation 
scheme, and provide promising prospects for its 
application to existing and new bio-event cor-
pora. 
We are currently working on a large scale an-
notation effort, involving multiple independent 
annotators. Although our main objective is to 
enrich the entire GENIA event corpus with meta-
knowledge information, we also plan to create a 
small corpus of full papers enriched with bio-
event and meta-knowledge annotations.
