Abstract
Post-editing performed by translators is an
increasingly common use of machine trans-
lated texts. While high quality MT may in-
crease productivity, post-editing poor transla-
tions can be a frustrating task which requires
more effort than translating from scratch. For
this reason, estimating whether machine trans-
lations are of sufficient quality to be used
for post-editing and finding means to reduce
post-editing effort are an important field of
study. Post-editing effort consists of different
aspects, of which temporal effort, or the time
spent on post-editing, is the most visible and
involves not only the technical effort needed
to perform the editing, but also the cognitive
effort required to detect and plan necessary
corrections. Cognitive effort is difficult to ex-
amine directly, but ways to reduce the cogni-
tive effort in particular may prove valuable in
reducing the frustration associated with post-
editing work. In this paper, we describe an
experiment aimed at studying the relationship
between technical post-editing effort and cog-
nitive post-editing effort by comparing cases
where the edit distance and a manual score re-
flecting perceived effort differ. We present re-
sults of an error analysis performed on such
sentences and discuss the clues they may pro-
vide about edits requiring great cognitive ef-
fort compared to the technical effort, on one
hand, or little cognitive effort, on the other.
1 Introduction
An increasingly common use for machine transla-
tion is producing texts to be post-edited by transla-
tors. While sufficiently high-quality MT has been
shown to produce benefits for productivity, a well-
known problem is that post-editing poor machine
translation can require more effort than translating
from scratch. Measuring and estimating post-editing
effort is therefore a growing concern addressed by
Confidence Estimation (CE) (Specia, 2011).
Time spent on post-editing can be seen as the
most visible and economically most important as-
pect of post-editing effort (Krings, 2001); however,
post-editing effort can be defined and approached in
different ways. Krings (2001) divides post-editing
effort into three types: 1. temporal, 2. cognitive
and 3. technical. Temporal effort refers to post-
editing time. Cognitive effort involves identifying
the errors in the MT and the necessary steps to cor-
rect the output. Technical effort then consists of the
keystrokes and cut-and-paste operations needed to
produce the post-edited version after the errors have
been detected and corrections planned. These dif-
ferent aspects of effort are not necessarily equal in
various situations. In some cases, the errors may be
easy to detect but involve several technical opera-
tions to be corrected. In other cases, parsing the sen-
tence and detecting the errors may require consid-
erable cognitive effort, although the actual technical
operations required are quick and easy. According
to Krings (2001), temporal effort is a combination
of both cognitive and technical effort, with cogni-
tive effort being the decisive factor. Assessing and
reducing the cognitive effort involved in MT post-
editing would therefore be important but the task
is far from simple. Past experiments have involved
cognitive approaches such as think-aloud protocols
(Krings, 2001; O?Brien, 2005; Carl et al, 2011) and
181
post-editing effort scores assigned by human evalua-
tors (Specia et al, 2009; Specia, 2011; Specia et al,
2011).
While edit operations reflect the amount of tech-
nical effort needed, subjective assessments of per-
ceived post-editing effort needed can serve as a mea-
sure of cognitive post-editing effort: in order to give
such an estimate, the evaluator needs to cognitively
process the segment in order to detect the errors
and plan the necessary corrections. Using these two
measures, a comparison of technical effort and per-
ceived amount of post-editing effort can serve as a
way to evaluate cognitive post-editing effort. We
propose that studying cases where the perceived ef-
fort necessary is greater or smaller than the num-
ber of actual edit operations performed may provide
clues to situations where the cognitive and technical
effort differ. Cases where the human editor overes-
timates the need for editing (as compared to num-
ber of edit operations performed) could indicate that
these segments contain errors requiring considerable
cognitive effort. On the other hand, cases where
the manual score underestimates the amount of edit-
ing needed could indicate errors that require rela-
tively little cognitive effort compared to the number
of technical operations.
To examine the question of differences in techni-
cal and cognitive post-editing effort, we present an
analysis of MT segments that have different levels
of post-editing indicated by the manual effort score
and actual number of post-edit operations indicated
by the edit distance. By analyzing cases where these
two measures of post-editing effort differ, it may be
possible to isolate cases that require more cognitive
effort than technical effort and vice versa. Section 3
describes the material and method used in the exper-
iment, and the results of the analysis are presented
in Section 4.
2 Related work
As the temporal aspect of post-editing effort is im-
portant for the practice of machine translation post-
editing, post-editing time has been a commonly
used measure of post-editing effort (Krings, 2001;
O?Brien, 2005; Specia et al, 2009; Tatsumi, 2009;
Tatsumi and Roturier, 2010; Specia, 2011; Carl et
al., 2011). The technical aspect of post-editing effort
has been approached by following keystrokes and
cut-and-paste operations (Krings, 2001; O?Brien,
2005; Carl et al, 2011) or using automatic met-
rics for edit distance between the raw MT and post-
edited version (Tatsumi, 2009; Temnikova, 2010;
Tatsumi and Roturier, 2010; Specia and Farzindar,
2010; Specia, 2011; Blain et al, 2011). Several edit
operations may also be incorporated in one ?post-
edit action (PEA)?, introduced by Blain et al (2011).
For example, changing the number of a noun propa-
gates changes to other words, such as the determin-
ers and adjectives modifying it. Tatsumi and Ro-
turier (2010) also explore the relationship between
temporal and technical aspects of post-editing effort.
Cognitive aspects of post-editing effort have been
approached with the help of keystroke logging
(Krings, 2001; O?Brien, 2005; Carl et al, 2011)
and gaze data (Carl et al, 2011), attempting to mea-
sure cognitive effort in terms of pauses and fixations.
O?Brien (2005) also experiments with the use of
choice network analysis (CNA) and think-aloud pro-
tocols (TAP). Human scores for post-editing effort
have involved assessing the amount of post-editing
needed (Specia et al, 2009; Specia, 2011) or ade-
quacy of the MT (Specia et al, 2011).
Temnikova (2010) proposes the analysis of the
types of changes and comparison to post-editing
time as a way to explore cognitive effort. For this
purpose, Temnikova (2010) builds upon the MT er-
ror classification by Vilar et al (2006) and their own
post-editing experiments using controlled language
to draft a classification for the cognitive effort re-
quired for correcting different types of MT errors.
This classification defines ten types of errors and
ranks them from 1 to 10 with 1 indicating the eas-
iest and 10 the hardest error type to correct. The
easiest errors are considered to be connected to the
morphological level, or correct words with incorrect
form, followed by the lexical level, involving incor-
rect style synonyms, incorrect words, extra words,
missing words and erroneously translated idiomatic
expressions. The hardest errors in the classification
relate to syntactic level and include wrong punctua-
tion, missing punctuation, then word order at word
level and finally word order at phrase level. The
ranking is based on studies in written language com-
prehension and error detection. Results reported in
Temnikova (2010) suggest that pre-edited machine
182
translations that had previously been found to re-
quire less post-editing effort measured by post-edit
time and edit distance contain less errors that are
cognitively more difficult compared to MT that had
not been pre-edited.
In this study, we aim to investigate the relation-
ship between the cognitive effort and the technical
effort involved in post-editing. Edit distance be-
tween MT segments and their post-edited versions
is used as a measure of technical effort and human
effort scores as a measure of cognitive effort.
3 Material and method
The data used in this study consists of English to
Spanish MT segments from the evaluation task train-
ing set provided for the quality estimation task at
the NAACL 2012 Seventh Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation WMT12. 1 The train-
ing set consists English to Spanish machine trans-
lations of news texts, produced by a phrase-based
SMT system. The data available for each segment
includes the English source segment, Spanish ref-
erence translation produced by a human translator,
machine translation into Spanish, post-edited ver-
sion of the machine translation and a manual score
indicating how much editing would be required to
transform the MT segment into a useful translation.
The manual score included is the average of scor-
ing conducted by three professional translators us-
ing a 5-point scale where (1) indicates the segment
is incomprehensible and needs to be translated from
scratch, (2) significant editing is required (50-70%
of the output), (3) about 25-50% of the output needs
to be edited, (4) about 10-25% needs to be edited,
and (5) little to no editing is required.
Additional information includes the SMT align-
ment tables. The alignments were not part of the
original set, and in some cases differed slightly from
the segments that had been used for the manual scor-
ing. As we intended to make use of the alignments
from source to MT, we included only segments that
were identical in the original evaluated set.
To measure the amount of editing performed on
the segments, the translation edit rate (TER) (Snover
et al, 2006) was calculated using the post-edited
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/
quality-estimation-task.html
versions as reference. TER measures the minimum
number of edits that are needed to transform the ma-
chine translation into the post-edited segment used
as reference. Edits can be insertion, deletion, substi-
tution or reordering and the score is calculated as the
number of edits divided by the number of tokens in
the reference. The higher the TER score, the more
edits have been performed.
As our aim was to focus on cases where the per-
ceived effort score and the amount of editing dif-
fered, we looked for two types of sentences at the
opposite ends of the manual effort scoring scale: (1)
Cases where the manual score indicated more edit-
ing was needed than had actually been performed.
(2) Cases where the manual score indicated less edit-
ing was needed than had actually been performed.
For Case (1), we selected segments with a manual
score of 2.5 or lower, meaning that at least 50% of
the segment needed editing according to the evalu-
ators. We looked for the ones with the lowest TER
scores, trying to find at least 30 sentences. The set
selected for analysis consists of 37 sentences with a
manual effort score of 2.5 or lower and TER score
0.33 or lower. For comparison, we also selected the
same number of sentences with similar TER scores
but with manual scores of 4 or above. These sets are
referred to as the low TER set.
For Case (2), we selected segments with a manual
score of 4 or above, meaning that no more than 25%
of the segment needed editing according to the eval-
uator. Again, we looked for about 30 sentences with
the highest TER scores. The set selected consists
of 35 sentences with a manual effort score of 4 or
higher, and TER score 0.45 or higher. For compar-
ison, we also selected sentences with similar TER
scores but low manual scores. These sets are re-
ferred to as the high TER set.
The selected MT segments and post-edited ver-
sions were then tagged with the FreeLing Spanish
tagger (Padro? et al, 2010). The tagged versions
contain the surface form of the word, lemma and a
tag with part-of-speech (POS) and grammatical in-
formation. Other tools such as dependency parsing
were considered, but within the scope of this study,
we decided to experiment what changes can be ob-
served using only the basic lemma, POS and form
information.
The tagged versions were aligned manually, first
183
matching identical tokens (words and punctuation)
in the sentence, then matching words with the same
lemma but different surface form. The alignment
table was consulted to match substitutions that in-
volved a different word and even different POS.
Each matched pair of words in the MT and post-
edited versions was then labeled to indicate whether
the match was identical or involved editing the word
form, substituting with a different word of the same
POS or a word of different POS. Words appearing
in the post-edited version but not in the MT were la-
beled as insertions and words appearing in the MT
but not in the post-edited version as deletions. In
cases where several MT words were replaced with
one in the post-edited version or one MT word was
replaced with many in the post-edited, a match was
made between words of the same POS and form, if
such was found, or the first word in the sequence if
none matched. The remaining words were labeled
as inserted/deleted.
The positions of the matched words were also
compared. For matching the word order, changes
caused only by insertion or deletion of other words
were ignored, and words that had remained in the
same order after post-editing were labeled as same.
In cases where the word order did not match, the
word was labeled with the distance it had been
moved and whether it had been moved alone or as
a part of a larger group.
The totals of changes within a sentence were then
calculated and the patterns of changes made by ed-
itors were examined. In addition to the total num-
ber of edit operations, we considered the possibil-
ity that editing certain parts-of-speech might require
more effort than others. In particular, editing con-
tent words such as verbs or nouns might require
more effort than editing function words such as de-
terminers, because they are more central to convey-
ing the content of the sentence. Further, as Blain et
al. (2011) argue, changes to these words may prop-
agate changes to other words in the sentence. Punc-
tuation was also treated separately to follow Tem-
nikova?s (2010) classification of punctuation errors
as a class of their own.
The patterns found in the sample sentences were
compared to the comparison sets of sentences with
similar TER scores. Additionally, Spearman rank
correlations between the manual effort score and the
various edit categories were calculated for all tokens
and specific POS classes. The next section presents
the results of these comparisons.
4 Results
This section presents the results from the analysis
of post-editing changes. The total number of seg-
ments and tokens and the percentages of edited and
reordered tokens in each set are shown in Table 1.
Comparisons of the edit patterns between segments
with similar TER scores but different manual scores
are shown in Figures 1 to 4. Figure 1 presents the
distributions of edit categories in the low TER sets
and Figure 3 in the high TER sets. Figure 2 presents
the percentages of changed tokens and reordered to-
kens by POS class in the low TER set and Figure
4 in the high TER sets. In Figures 2 and 4, nouns,
verbs, adjectives and determiners are shown sepa-
rately, while other parts-of-speech are combined into
?Other?. Punctuation is also presented separately.
Tables 2 and 3 present Spearman rank correla-
tions between the manual score and different edit
categories. Overall correlations regardless of POS
are given for all edit categories. For specific POS
classes, only the edit categories with strongest cor-
relations are listed in each case.
4.1 Case 1: Low TER set
These sentences represent a case where the human
evaluators indicated that significant post-editing
would be needed but the low TER score indicated
that relatively little editing had been performed. The
most noticeable difference between segments with
high and low manual scores is the number of tokens:
low-scored segments have about twice as many to-
kens on average than the high-scored ones (see Ta-
ble 1) and the number of tokens in the post-edited
segment has a strong negative correlation (Table 2).
Besides segment length, other strong correlations in-
volve different types of reordering. Reorderings in-
volving a distance of one step show weaker corre-
lation than changes involving a longer distance. No
correlation was found for any of the word change
categories in this case.
Broken down by the POS class, results are simi-
lar to the overall result in that reordering categories
have the strongest (negative) correlations with the

effort score. Strongest correlations also mostly in-
volve nouns, adjectives or verbs. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, the differences in percentage of edited tokens
are largest for verbs and adjectives. In high-scored
sentences, 72% of verbs were unchanged by the ed-
itor compared to 55% in the low-scored ones. In
both cases, most edits to verbs involved changing
the form of the verb, (23% in low-scored vs 11% in
high-scored). Adjectives have a similar pattern with
18% of edited adjective forms in low-scored vs 7%
in high-scored sentences.
Sentences with high manual scores actually have
more cases of edited determiners and nouns, al-
though for nouns the difference is only 1%. Most
edits to determiners involved deletion (15% of deter-
miners) or changed form (11%) in the case of high-
scored sentences. In low-scored sentences, insertion
was most common (10% of determiners). Within

the class ?Other? combining numbers, adverbs, con-
junctions, pronouns and prepositions, adverbs were
an similar case in that there were more unchanged
adverbs in the low-rated sentences (86%) than in the
high-rated (72%). However, the total number of ad-
verbs in either set was very small.
4.2 Case 2: High TER set
These sentences represent a case where the human
evaluators indicated only a little editing was needed
but the high TER score indicated much more editing
had been performed. Again one noticeable differ-
ence between the sentences with low and high man-
ual scores is the number of tokens (see Table 1), al-
though the negative correlation shown in Table 3 was
not as strong as for the low TER set.
For these sentences, word changes have stronger
correlations with the manual effort score (Table 3).
While the shares of fully matched words are fairly
equal between the sentences, differences appear in
some of the edit categories. Sentences with high
manual scores have more cases where the word form
has been edited (Figure 3), and changed form has
the strongest (positive) correlation after number of
tokens. High-scored segments also appear to have
more deletions, but essentially no correlation was
found between the manual score and deletions on
the segment level. As shown in Figure 3, low-scored
segments have more cases of substitution with dif-
ferent word. Reordering is again more common in
low-scored segments, but correlations for reordering
are weaker than in the low TER set. Cases where
one word has been moved alone rather than as a part
of a group has the strongest correlation among the
reordering categories.

Figure 4: Edited and reordered tokens by POS - High TER
in Table 3 involves insertion of words in the com-
bined class ?Other? (numbers, adverbs, conjunc-
tions, pronouns and prepositions). Within this class,
pronouns actually required most edits: in low-scored
segments, 50% of pronouns were inserted by the ed-
itor (32% in high-scored segments). The largest dif-
ference in the percentage of edited tokens is seen
with nouns (41% edited in low-scored segments vs
32% in high-scored, and edits related to nouns are
also among the strongest correlations for this set. In
the case of adjectives, the segments with low man-
ual score actually have more cases where no edit-
ing of the word has been required (61% vs 53%),
but high-scored sentences contain a larger share of
cases (32% vs 16%) where only the form of the ad-
jective has been edited. However, these correlations
remained weak. Reordering involving nouns and ad-
jectives, on the other hand, again appears among the
strongest correlations.
5 Discussion
Perhaps the most obvious difference between seg-
ments with high and low manual scores is segment
length: long segments tend to get low scores even
when the amount of editing turns out to be less than
estimated. The effect of sentence length has also
been observed in other studies, e.g. (Tatsumi, 2009).
One simple explanation would be that a high total
number of words leads to a high total number of
changes to be made and therefore involves consid-
erable technical post-editing effort. However, as the
case of segments with low manual scores but low
TER show, sometimes these long sentences do not,
in fact, require a large number of edit operations.
187
This suggests also increased cognitive effort, as the
sheer length may make it difficult for the evalua-
tor/editor to perceive what needs to be changed and
plan the edits.
We also noticed during the analysis that some of
the very long segments actually consisted of two
sentences. Furthermore, in some these cases, one
of the sentences contained few changes while most
of the changes were confined to the other. Sim-
ilarly, long segments consisting of only one sen-
tence sometimes contained long unchanged pas-
sages while some other part of the sentence was
edited significantly. In these cases, such unchanged
passages could be useful to the post-editor in real life
situations, but the error-dense passage affects per-
ception of the segment as a whole. Perhaps this sug-
gests that assessing MT for post-editing and post-
editing itself could benefit from presenting longer
segments in shorter units, allowing the evaluator or
editor to choose and discard different units within a
longer segment.
Tatsumi (2009) also found that very short sen-
tences increased post-editing time. In this study, all
extremely short sentences found had received high
scores from the human evaluators. Some are found
in the low TER/high manual score set used for com-
parison purposes, but there are also some in the
set of sentences with high TER/high manual score,
meaning that there were relatively many edits com-
pared to the length of the segment but the evaluators
had indicated that little editing was needed. At least
for the segments analyzed here, it appears that the
evaluators did not consider short sentences to require
much effort regardless of the actual number of edits
performed. In Tatsumi?s (2009) results, also other
aspects, such as source sentence structure and de-
pendency errors in the MT were discovered to have
an effect on post-editing time. In this study, sentence
structure and dependency errors were not explicitly
examined, but these aspects would be of interest in
future work.
Edits related to reordering also appear to be con-
nected to low manual scores, as low-scored sen-
tences involved more reordering than high-scored
ones in both cases. This reflects Temnikova?s (2010)
error ranking where errors involving word order,
particularly at phrase level, are considered the most
difficult to correct. Besides the number of reorder-
ings necessary, the results of this study may suggest
some differences in whether reordering involves iso-
lated words or groups of words and distances of one
step (word level order) or longer distances.
Examining the results by parts-of-speech may
suggest that overall, edits related to nouns, verbs
or adjectives take more effort than other POS, be-
cause in both sets, strongest correlations mainly in-
volved nouns, verbs and adjectives. In both sets,
sentences with low manual scores contained more
cases of edited verbs, and verb matches had one of
the strongest correlations in the low TER set. On
the other hand, edits related to nouns appeared to
have particularly strong correlations in the high TER
set. In this set, however, the strongest negative cor-
relation was found for insertion of the other POS
(mainly pronouns), so at least some of the other POS
may also be difficult to edit.
Some cases where relatively little cognitive effort
is required may be suggested by the situations where
the high-scored sentences in fact contain more ed-
its than the low-scored ones. In the high TER
set, sentences with high manual scores contained
more cases where only the form of a word has been
edited, whereas sentences with low manual scores
contained more cases of substitution with a differ-
ent word or even different POS. This reflects the
ranking of such errors in (Temnikova, 2010), where
word form errors are considered cognitively easiest.
This particularly appears to be the case for adjectives
in this set. Although segments with a high manual
score actually have a smaller number of fully cor-
rect adjectives than low-scored ones, they contain a
larger share of instances where only the form of the
adjective has been edited. Another example of edits
involving less cognitive effort might be determiners
in the low TER set, where again sentences with high
manual scores contain more edited determiners than
those with low scores. In this case, deletion of de-
terminers was common in addition to changing the
form.
Overall, deletion and insertion or extra words and
missing words appeared to have little effect. While
sentences with high manual scores have a slightly
higher percentage of deleted words in both sets, the
correlation was weak. Most of the deletions of con-
tent words seemed to involve auxiliary verbs, but in
some instances it is difficult to say whether the ed-
188
itor has, in fact, considered something ?extra? in-
formation and why, whether there has been a de-
liberate choice to implicitate certain information or
whether the deletion has been at least partly uninten-
tional. During the alignment process of the MT and
post-edited version, it appeared that some source el-
ements, in some cases entire clauses and in others
certain words, were completely missing in the post-
edited version. On the other hand, some of the in-
sertions were also difficult to map onto anything in
the source segment and the editor appeared to have
brought in something extra. One clear example in-
volved adding a conversion from miles per hour to
km per hour that did not appear in the MT or source
text. Such deletions and insertions concerned only a
few isolated cases which were not examined in detail
within the scope of this work. Some error classifica-
tions, such as Blain et al (2011), do also take errors
made by post-editors into account, and one interest-
ing aspect of post-editing would be to study the cor-
rectness of post-edits. If it would turn out that post-
editors are more prone to make errors or to fail to
correct errors, (particularly errors related to content
as opposed to typographical errors etc.) in certain
situations, this might suggest situations that involve
particular cognitive effort or mislead the editor.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented an experiment aimed at explor-
ing the difference between cognitive and technical
aspects of MT post-editing effort by comparing hu-
man scores of perceived effort necessary to actual
edits made by post-editors. We examined cases
where considerably more or considerably less post-
editing was done than predicted by the evaluators?
estimate of post-editing needed. The results show
that one of the factors most affecting the perception
of post-editing necessary involves segment length:
long segments are perceived to involve much effort
and therefore receive low scores even when the ac-
tual number of edits turns out to be small. This sug-
gests that sentence length affects the cognitive effort
required in identifying errors and planning the cor-
rections, and presenting MT for this type of evalu-
ation and post-editing may benefit from displaying
segments to the evaluator or editor in smaller units.
The results also suggest other features affecting
cognitive effort. Sentences with low manual scores
were found to involve more reordering, indicating
increased cognitive effort, while sentences with high
manual scores were found to involve more cases of
correct words with incorrect form, suggesting that
these errors are cognitively easier. Examining edit
type distributions in different POS classes suggests
that edits related to certain parts-of-speech, namely
nouns, verbs and adjectives, may also be associated
with perception of more effort. On the other hand,
sentences with high scores in some cases contained
even more editing of some other POS and types,
such as editing forms of adjectives or deleting deter-
miners, which may indicate that these errors affect
perception of effort to a lesser extent. As the num-
ber of sentences used was relatively low, however,
such effects would require more study.
In future work, we aim to more explicitly exam-
ine combinations of edit operations, (e.g. changing
the form and reordering, moving a group and substi-
tuting one word within the group) and features such
as dependency errors (Tatsumi, 2009). Further ex-
periments with data on other language pairs would
also be needed. Another interesting aspect for future
work would be trying to distinguish between edits
made for reasons of incorrect language and edits for
reasons of incorrect content. Further, examining the
success of post-editing and exploring whether post-
editors themselves are prone to make errors or fail to
correct errors in certain situations could be an inter-
esting avenue for discovering situations that involve
significant cognitive effort.
