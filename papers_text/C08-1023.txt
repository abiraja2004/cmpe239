 Abstract 
This paper describes the design and 
evaluation of an extractive summarizer 
for educational science content called 
COGENT. COGENT extends MEAD 
based on strategies elicited from an em-
pirical study with science domain and in-
structional design experts. COGENT 
identifies sentences containing pedagogi-
cally relevant concepts for a specific sci-
ence domain. The algorithms pursue a 
hybrid approach integrating both domain 
independent bottom-up sentence scoring 
features and domain-aware top-down fea-
tures. Evaluation results indicate that 
COGENT outperforms existing summar-
izers and generates summaries that 
closely resemble those generated by hu-
man experts. COGENT concept invento-
ries appear to also support the computa-
tional identification of student miscon-
ceptions about earthquakes and plate tec-
tonics. 
1 Introduction 
Multidocument summarization (MDS) research 
efforts have resulted in significant advancements 
in algorithm and system design (Mani, 2001). 
Many of these efforts have focused on summariz-
ing news articles, but not significantly explored 
the research issues arising from processing edu-
cational content to support pedagogical applica-
tions. This paper describes our research into the 
application of MDS techniques to educational

science content to generate pedagogically useful 
summaries. 
Knowledge maps are graphical representations 
of domain information laid out as networks of 
nodes containing rich concept descriptions inter-
connected using a fixed set of relationship types 
(Holley and Dansereau, 1984). Knowledge maps 
are a variant of the concept maps used to capture, 
assess, and track student knowledge in education 
research (Novak and Gowin, 1984). Learning 
research indicates that knowledge maps may be 
useful cognitive scaffolds, helping users lacking 
domain expertise to understand the macro-level 
structure of an information space (O'Donnell et 
al., 2002). Knowledge maps have emerged as an 
effective representation to generate conceptual 
browsers that help students navigate educational 
digital libraries, such as the Digital Library for 
Earth System Education (DLESE.org) (Butcher 
et al, 2006). In addition, knowledge maps have 
proven useful for domain and instructional ex-
perts to capture domain knowledge from digital 
library resources and to analyze student under-
standing for the purposes of providing formative 
assessments (Ahmad et al, 2007).  
Knowledge maps have proven useful both as 
representations of knowledge for assessment 
purposes and as learning resources for presenta-
tion to students. However, domain knowledge 
map construction by experts is an expensive 
knowledge engineering activity. In this paper, we 
describe our progress towards the automated 
generation of pedagogically useful extractive 
summaries from educational texts about a sci-
ence domain. In the context of automated knowl-
edge map generation, summary sentences corre-
spond to concepts. While the detection of rela-
tionships between concepts is also part of our 
overall research agenda, this paper focuses solely 
on concept identification using MDS techniques. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
177
lows. First, we review related work in the areas 
of automated concept extraction from texts and 
extractive summarization. We then describe the 
empirical study we have conducted to understand 
how domain and instructional design experts 
identify pedagogically important science con-
cepts in educational digital library resources. 
Next, we provide a detailed description of the 
algorithms we have designed based on expert 
strategies elicited from our empirical study. We 
then present and discuss our evaluation results 
using automated summarization metrics and hu-
man judgments. Finally, we present our conclu-
sions and future work in this area. 
2 Related Work 
Our work is informed by efforts to automate the 
acquisition of ontology concepts from text. On-
toLearn (Navigli and Velardi, 2004) extracts do-
main terminology from a collection of texts using 
a syntactic parse to identify candidate terms that 
are filtered based on domain relevance and con-
nected using a semantic interpretation based on 
word sense disambiguation. The newly identified 
concepts and relationships are used to update an 
existing ontology. Knowledge Puzzle focuses on 
n-grams to produce candidate terms filtered 
based on term frequency in the input documents 
and on the number of relationships associated 
with a given term (Zouaq et al, 2007). This ap-
proach leverages pattern extraction techniques to 
identify concepts and relationships. While these 
approaches produce ontologies useful for compu-
tational purposes, the identified concepts are of a 
very fine granularity and therefore may yield 
graphs not suitable for identifying student mis-
conceptions or for presentation back to the stu-
dent. Clustering by committee has also been used 
to discover concepts from a text by grouping 
terms into conceptually related clusters (Lin and 
Pantel, 2002). The resulting clusters appear to be 
tightly related, but operate at a very fine level of 
granularity. Our approach focuses on sentences 
as units of knowledge to produce concise repre-
sentations that may be useful both as computa-
tional objects and as learning resources to present 
back to the student. Therefore, extractive sum-
marization research also informs our work. 
Topic representation and topic themes have 
been used to explore promising MDS techniques 
(Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2005). Recent efforts 
in graph-based MDS have integrated sentence 
affinity, information richness and diversity pen-
alties to produce very promising results (Wan 
and Yang, 2006). Finally, MEAD is a widely 
used multi-document summarization and evalua-
tion platform (Radev et al, 2000). MEAD re-
search efforts have resulted in significant contri-
butions to support the development of summari-
zation applications (Radev et al, 2000). While 
all these systems have produced promising re-
sults in automated evaluations, none have di-
rectly targeted educational content as input or the 
generation of pedagogically useful summaries. 
We are directly building upon MEAD due its 
focus on sentence extraction and its high degree 
of modularization. 
3 Empirical Study 
We have conducted a study to capture how hu-
man experts construct and use knowledge maps. 
In this 10-month study, we examined how ex-
perts created knowledge maps from educational 
digital libraries and how they used the maps to 
assess student work and provide personalized 
feedback. 
In this paper, we are focusing on the knowl-
edge map construction aspects of the study. Four 
geology and instructional design experts collabo-
ratively selected 20 resources from DLESE to 
construct a domain knowledge map on earth-
quakes and plates tectonics for high school age 
learners. The experts independently created 
knowledge maps of individual resources which 
they collaboratively merged into the final domain 
knowledge map in a one-day workshop. The re-
sulting domain knowledge map consisted of 564 
nodes containing domain concepts and 578 rela-
tionships. The concepts consist of 7,846 words, 
or 5% of the total number of words in the origi-
nal resources. Figure 1 shows a fragment of the 
domain knowledge map created by our experts. 
 
 
Figure 1. Fragment of domain  knowledge map 
created by domain and instructional experts 
 
Experts created nodes containing concepts of 
varying granularity, including nouns, noun 
phrases, partial sentences, single sentences, and 
178
multiple sentences. Our analysis of this domain 
knowledge map indicates that experts relied on 
copying-and-pasting (58%) and paraphrasing 
(37%) to create most domain concepts. Only 5% 
of the nodes could not be traced directly to the 
original resources. 
Experts used relationship types in a Zipf-like 
distribution with the top 10 relationship types 
accounting for 64% of all relationships. The top 
2 relationship types each accounted for more 
than 10% of all relationships: elaborations (19% 
or 110 links) and examples (14% or 78 links). 
We have established the completeness of this 
domain knowledge map by asking a domain ex-
pert to assess its content coverage of nationally-
recognized educational goals on earthquakes and 
plate tectonics for high school age learners using 
the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science (AAAS) Benchmarks (Project 2061, 
1993). The results indicate adequate content cov-
erage of the relevant AAAS Benchmarks achieved 
through 82 of the concepts (15%) with the re-
maining 482 concepts (85%) providing very de-
tailed elaborations of the associated learning 
goals. 
Qualitative analysis of the verbal protocols 
captured during the study indicates that all ex-
perts used external sources to construct the do-
main knowledge map. Experts made references 
to their own knowledge (e.g., ?I know that??), 
to content learned or taught in geology courses, 
to other resources used in the study, and to the 
National Science Education Standards (NSES), a 
comprehensive collection of nationally-
recognized science learning goals for K-12 stu-
dents (National Research Council, 1996). 
We have examined sentence extraction agree-
ment between experts using a kappa measure that 
accounts for prevalence of judgments and con-
flicting biases amongst experts, called PABA-
kappa (Byrt et al, 1993). The average PABA-
kappa value of 0.62 indicates that our experts 
substantially agree on sentence extraction from 
digital library resources. While this study was 
not designed as an annotation project to support 
summarization evaluation, this level of agree-
ment indicates that the concepts selected by the 
experts may serve as the reference summary to 
evaluate the performance of our summarizer. 
4 Summarizer for Science Education 
Creating a knowledge map from a collection of 
input texts involves identifying sentences con-
taining important domain concepts, linking con-
cepts, and labeling those links. This paper fo-
cuses solely on identifying and extracting peda-
gogically relevant sentences as domain concepts. 
We have designed and implemented an extrac-
tive summarizer for educational science content, 
called COGENT, based on MEAD version 3.11 
(Radev et al, 2000). COGENT processes a col-
lection of educational digital library resources by 
first preprocessing each resource using Tidy 
(tidy.sourceforge.net) to fix improperly format-
ted HTML code. COGENT then merges multiple 
web pages into a single HTML document and 
extracts the contents of each resource into a plain 
text file. We have extended MEAD with sen-
tence scoring features based on domain content, 
document structure, and sentence length. 
4.1 Domain Content 
We have designed two sentence-scoring features 
that aim to capture the domain content relevance 
of each sentence: the educational standards 
feature and the gazetteer feature. 
We have developed a feature that models how 
human experts used external sources to identify 
and extract concepts. The educational standards 
feature uses the textual description of the 
relevant AAAS Benchmarks on earthquakes and 
plate tectonics for high-school age learners and 
the associated NSES. Each sentence receives a 
score based on its similarity to the text contents 
of the learning goals and educational standards 
computed using a TFIDF (Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency) approach  (Salton 
and Buckley, 1988). We have used KinoSearch, 
a Perl implementation of the Lucene search 
engine (lucene.apache.org), to create an index 
that includes the AAAS Benchmarks learning 
goal description (boosted by 2), subject (boosted 
by 8), and keywords (boosted by 2), plus the text 
of the associated national standards (not 
boosted). Sentence scores are based on the 
similarity scores generated by KinoSearch in 
response to a query consisting of the sentence 
text. 
To account for the large number of examples 
used by the experts in the domain knowledge 
map (14% of all links), we have developed a 
feature that reflects the number and relevance of 
the geographical names in each sentence. Earth 
science examples often refer to names of 
geographical places, including geological 
formations on the planet. The gazetteer feature 
leverages the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) 
Gazetteer service (Hill, 2000) to check whether 
named entities identified in each sentence match 
179
entries in the ADL Gazetteer. A gazetteer is a 
georeferencing resource containing information 
about locations and place-names, including 
latitude and longitude as well as type information 
about the corresponding geographical feature. 
Each sentence receives a score based on a TFIDF 
approach where the TF is the number of times a 
particular location name appears in the sentence 
and the IDF is the inverse of the count of 
gazetteer entries matching the location name. If 
the ADL Gazetteer returns a large number of 
results for a given place-name, it means there are 
many geographical locations identified by that 
name. Our assumption is that unique names may 
be more pedagogically relevant. For example, 
Ohio receives an IDF score of 0.0625 because 
the ADL Gazetteer contains 16 entries so named, 
while the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the distinctive 
underwater mountain range dividing the Atlantic 
Ocean, receives a score of 1.0 as it appears only 
once. 
4.2 Document Structure 
Based on the intuition that the HTML structure 
of a web site reflects content relevancy, we have 
developed the hypertext feature. The hypertext 
feature assigns a higher score to sentences con-
tained under higher level HTML headings.  
  
Heading Bonus 
H1 1/1 = 1.00 
H2 1/2 = 0.50 
H3 1/3 = 0.33 
H4 1/4 = 0.25 
H5 1/5 = 0.20 
H6 1/6 = 0.17 
Table 1. Hypertext feature heading bonus 
 
Within a given heading level, the hypertext 
feature assigns a higher score to sentences that 
appear earlier within that level based on both 
relative paragraph order within the heading and 
relative sentence position within each paragraph. 
The equation used to compute the hypertext 
score for a sentence is  
44
_1 * _1 * _  _ nosentnoparbonusheadingscorehypertext =  
where heading_bonus is obtained from Table 1, 
par_no is the paragraph number within the head-
ing, and sent_no is the sentence number within 
the paragraph. We use the 4 1 x   function to at-
tenuate the contributions to the feature score of 
later paragraphs and sentences. Initially, we used 
the same function MEAD uses to modulate its 
position feature ( 2 1 x ), but initial experimenta-
tion indicated this function decayed too rapidly, 
resulting in later sentences being over-penalized. 
4.3 Sentence Length 
To promote the extraction of sentences contain-
ing scientific concepts, we have developed the 
content word density feature. This feature makes 
a cut-off decision based on the ratio of content 
words to function words in a sentence. The con-
tent word density feature uses a pre-populated 
list of function words (a stopword list) to calcu-
late the ratio of content to function words within 
each sentence, keeping sentences that meet or 
exceed the ratio of 50%. This cut-off value im-
plies that the extracted sentences contain rela-
tively more content words than function words. 
4.4 Sentence Scoring and Selection 
We compute the final score of each sentence by 
adding the scores obtained for the MEAD default 
configuration features (centroid and position) to 
the scores for the COGENT features (educational 
standards, gazetteer, and hypertext). After the 
sentences have been sorted according to their 
cumulative scores, we keep sentences that pass 
the cut-off constraints, including the MEAD 
length feature equal or greater than 9 and CO-
GENT content word density equal or greater than 
50%. We use the MEAD cosine re-ranker to 
eliminate redundant sentences based on a cutoff 
similarity value of 0.7. Since human experts used 
only 5% of the total word count in the resources, 
we have configured MEAD to use a 5% word 
compression rate. 
5 Evaluation 
We have evaluated COGENT by processing the 
20 digital library resources used in the empirical 
study and comparing its output against the con-
cepts identified by the experts. 
5.1 Quality 
To assess the quality of the generated summaries, 
we have examined three configurations: Random, 
Default, and COGENT. The Random configura-
tion extracts a random collection of sentences 
from the input texts. The Default configuration 
uses the MEAD default centroid, position and 
length (cut-off value of 9) sentence scoring fea-
tures. Finally, the COGENT configuration in-
cludes the MEAD default features and the CO-
GENT features. The Default and COGENT con-
figurations use the MEAD cosine function with a 
threshold of 0.7 to eliminate redundant sen-
180
tences. All three configurations use a word com-
pression factor of 5% resulting in summaries of 
very similar length. 
For this evaluation, we leverage ROUGE (Lin 
and Hovy, 2003) to address the relative quality of 
the generated summaries based on common n-
gram counts and longest common subsequence 
(LCS). We report on ROUGE-1 (unigrams), 
ROUGE-2 (bigrams), ROUGE W-1.2 (weighted 
LCS), and ROUGE-S* (skip bigrams) as they 
appear to correlate well with human judgments 
for longer multi-document summaries, particu-
larly ROUGE-1 (Lin, 2004). Table 2 shows the 
results of this ROUGE-based evaluation includ-
ing recall (R), precision (P), and balanced f-
measure (F).

Table 2. Quality evaluation results (5% word 
compression) 
 
COGENT consistently outperforms the Ran-
dom and Default baselines based on all four re-
ported ROUGE measures. Given that much of 
the original research efforts on MEAD have cen-
tered on news articles, this result is not surpris-
ing. Pedagogical content, such as the educational 
digital library resources used in our work, differs 
in rhetorical intent, structure and terminology 
from the news articles leveraged by the MEAD 
researchers. However, the COGENT features 
described here are complementary to the default 
MEAD configuration. COGENT can best be 
characterized as a hybrid MDS, integrating bot-
tom-up (centroid, position, length, hypertext, and 
content word density) and top-down (educational 
standards and gazetteer) sentence scoring fea-
tures. This hybrid approach reflects our findings 
from observing expert behaviors for identifying 
concepts from educational digital library re-
sources. We believe the overall improvement in 
quality scores may be due to the COGENT fea-
tures targeting different dimensions of what con-
stitutes a pedagogically effective summary than 
the default MEAD features. 
To characterize the COGENT summary con-
tents, one of our research team members manu-
ally generated a summary corresponding to the 
best case for an extractive summarizer. This Best 
Case summary comprises the sentences from the 
digital library resources that align to the concepts 
selected by the human experts in our empirical 
study. Since the experts created concepts of vary-
ing granularity, this alignment produces the list 
of sentences that the experts would have pro-
duced if they had only selected single sentences 
to create concepts for their domain knowledge 
map. This summary comprises 621 sentences 
consisting of 13,116 words, or about a 9% word 
compression. 
For this aspect of the evaluation, we have used 
ROUGE-L, an LCS metric computed using 
ROUGE. The ROUGE-L computation examines 
the union LCS between each reference sentence 
and all the sentences in the candidate summary. 
We believe this metric may be well-suited to re-
flect the degree of linguistic surface structure 
similarity between summaries. We postulate that 
ROUGE-L may be able to account for the explic-
itly copy-pasted concepts and to detect the more 
subtle similarities with paraphrased concepts in 
the expert-generated domain knowledge map. 
We have also used the content-based evaluation 
capabilities of MEAD to report on a cosine 
measure to capture similarity between the candi-
date summaries and the reference. Table 3 shows 
the results of this aspect of the evaluation includ-
ing recall (R), precision (P), and balanced f-
measure (F).

Cosine 0.5382 0.6748 0.8325 0.9323 
Table 3. Content-based evaluation results (word 
compression in parentheses) 
 
COGENT consistently outperforms the Ran-
dom and Default baselines on both the ROUGE-
L and cosine measures. Given the cosine value of 
0.8325, it appears COGENT extracts sentences 
containing similar terms  in very similar fre-
quency distribution as the experts. 
The ROUGE-L scores also consistently indi-
cate that the COGENT summary may be closer 
to the reference summary in relative word order-
181
ing than either the Random or Default configura-
tions. However, the scores for the Best Case 
summary reveal two interesting points. First, the 
ROUGE-L recall score for COGENT (R=0. 
6021) is lower than that obtained by the Best 
Case summary (R=0.9669), meaning our sum-
marizer appears to be extracting different sen-
tences than those selected by the experts. Given 
the high cosine similarity with the reference 
summary (0.8325), we hypothesize that CO-
GENT may be selecting sentences that cover 
very similar concepts to those selected by the 
experts only expressed differently. Second, we 
would have expected the ROUGE-L precision 
score for the Best Case configuration to be closer 
to 1.0. Instead, the Best Case precision score is 
0.6256, only a minor improvement over CO-
GENT (P=0.5982). Since the sentences in the 
Best Case summary come directly from the digi-
tal library resources, we hypothesize that experts 
may have used extensive linguistic transforma-
tions for paraphrased concepts, resulting in struc-
tures that ROUGE-L could not identify as simi-
lar. 
Given the difference in word compression for 
the Best Case summary, we have performed an 
incremental analysis using the ROUGE-L meas-
ure shown in Figure 2.

This graph shows improved COGENT per-
formance in ROUGE-L recall as the length of the 
summary increases, while both precision and f-
measure degrade. COGENT can match the recall 
scores of the Best Case summary (R=0.9669) by 
making the generated summary longer (30% 
word compression rate or 32,619 words), but the 
precision would suffer a sizeable decay 
(P=0.1558). For educational applications, more 
comprehensive concept inventories (longer 
summaries) may be better suited for computa-
tional purposes, such as pedagogical reasoning 
about student understanding, while more succinct 
inventories (shorter summaries) may be more 
appropriate for display to the student. 
5.2 Pedagogical Utility 
We have evaluated COGENT?s pedagogical util-
ity in the context of computationally identifying 
student scientific misconceptions. We have de-
veloped algorithms that reliably detect incorrect 
statements in student essays by comparing an 
expert-created domain knowledge map to an ex-
pert-created knowledge map of an essay. These 
algorithms use textual entailment techniques 
based on a shallow linguistic analysis of knowl-
edge map concepts to identify sentences that con-
tradict concepts in the domain knowledge map. 
Initial evaluation results indicate that these algo-
rithms identify incorrect statements nearly as 
adeptly as human experts.

Table 4. Incorrect statement identification

As shown in Table 4, the algorithms detect 
87% of all incorrect statements identified by ex-
perts and 57% of the reported incorrect state-
ments agree with human judgments on the same 
task. By comparison, experts show 69% overlap 
on average along both dimensions. Introducing 
the COGENT concept inventory in place of the 
expert-created domain knowledge map improves 
recall performance, as the algorithms return 93% 
of all incorrect statements reported by the ex-
perts, while preserving 57% precision. These 
results indicate that the generated summary cov-
ers the necessary pedagogical concepts to com-
putationally identify student scientific miscon-
ceptions. 
Informal sampling of the sentences selected by 
COGENT shows the following three important 
science concepts receiving the highest scores:  
1. Earthquakes are the result of forces deep 
within the Earth's interior that continuously 
affect the surface of the Earth. 
2. Scientists believed that the movement of the 
Earth's plates bends and squeezes the rocks at 
the edges of the plates. 
3. In particular, four major scientific develop-
ments spurred the formulation of the plate-
182
tectonics theory: (1) demonstration of the 
ruggedness and youth of the ocean floor; (2) 
confirmation of repeated reversals of the 
Earth magnetic field in the geologic past; (3) 
emergence of the seafloor-spreading hypothe-
sis and associated recycling of oceanic crust; 
and (4) precise documentation that the world's 
earthquake and volcanic activity is concen-
trated along oceanic trenches and submarine 
mountain ranges. 
For a more rigorous analysis of the pedagogi-
cal utility of the COGENT concepts, we asked an 
instructional expert with domain expertise in ge-
ology to evaluate the 326 sentences returned by 
COGENT. The expert used a 5-point Likert scale 
to judge whether each concept would be peda-
gogically useful in the context of a concept in-
ventory on earthquakes and plate tectonics 
knowledge for high school age learners. The ex-
pert agreed or strongly agreed that 60% of the 
sentences would be pedagogically useful, with 
30% of the sentences being potentially useful and 
only 10% of the sentences being judged as not 
useful. These results indicate that COGENT ap-
pears to perform quite well at identifying sen-
tences that contain information relevant for 
learning about the domain. 
We have also completed an ablation study to 
identify the relative contribution of the COGENT 
features to the quality of the summary. We have 
focused on the cosine metric to capture the over-
all similarity between the COGENT concept in-
ventory and the concepts from the expert-created 
knowledge map.

such that the feature contributing the most to the 
all-features cosine score appears at the top of the 
table. Removing either the gazetteer or the hy-
pertext feature causes the largest drops in simi-
larity indicating the importance of the use of ex-
amples and the relevance of document structure 
for the quality of the COGENT-generated sum-
mary. Meanwhile both the educational standards 
and content word density appear to provide mod-
est but useful improvements to the quality of the 
COGENT summary. 
Given that our algorithms have only been 
evaluated on the topic of earthquakes and plate 
tectonics for high school age learners, COGENT 
may be limited in its ability to transcend domains 
due to its reliance on two domain-aware sentence 
scoring features: educational standards and gaz-
etteer. However, the educational standards fea-
ture may be applicable across other science top-
ics because the AAAS Benchmarks and NSES 
provide very thorough and detailed coverage of a 
wide range of topics for the Science, Technol-
ogy, Engineering, and Math disciplines for 
grades K-12. Only the gazetteer feature would 
need to be replaced, especially given its signifi-
cant contribution to the quality of the generated 
summary as indicated by the results of the abla-
tion study. We believe these results highlight the 
need to generalize our approach, perhaps using a 
classifier for identifying examples in educational 
texts without resorting to overly domain-specific 
language resources, such as the ADL Gazetteer. 
Overall, the evaluation results indicate that our 
approach holds promise for effectively identify-
ing concepts for inclusion in the construction of a 
pedagogically useful domain knowledge map 
from educational science content. 
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we have presented a multi-
document summarization system, COGENT, that 
integrates bottom-up and top-down sentence 
scoring features to identify pedagogically rele-
vant concepts from educational digital library 
resources. Our results indicate that COGENT 
generates concept inventories that resemble those 
identified by experts and outperforms existing 
multi-document summarization systems. We 
have also used the COGENT concept inventory 
as input to our  misconception identification al-
gorithms and the evaluation results indicate the 
algorithms perform as well as when using an ex-
pert-created domain knowledge map. In the con-
text of generating domain knowledge maps, our 
next step is to explore how machine learning 
techniques may be employed to connect concepts 
with links. 
Automating the process of creating inventories 
of important pedagogical concepts represents an 
important step towards creating scalable intelli-
183
gent learning and tutoring systems. We hope our 
progress in this direction may contribute to in-
crease the interest within the computational lin-
guistics research community in novel educational 
technology research.
