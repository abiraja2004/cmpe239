ABSTRACT 
In this paper, a flexible annotation schema called (SSTC) is introduced.  In order to describe the correspondence 
between different languages, we propose a variant of SSTC called synchronous SSTC (S-SSTC).  We will also 
describe how S-SSTC provides the flexibility to treat some of the non-standard cases, which are problematic to 
other synchronous formalisms. The proposed S-SSTC schema is well suited to describe the correspondence 
between different languages, in particular, relating a language with its translation in another language (i.e. in 
Machine Translation). Also it can be used as annotation for translation systems that automatically extract transfer 
mappings (rules or examples) from bilingual corpora. The S-SSTC is very well suited for the construction of a 
Bilingual Knowledge Bank (BKB), where the examples are kept in form of S-SSTCs.

1. INTRODUCTION  
There is now a consensus about the fact that natural 
language should be described as correspondences 
between different levels of representation. Much of 
theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very 
natural manner as stating correspondences 
(translations) between layers of representation 
structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996). 
In this paper, a flexible annotation schema called 
Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) 
(Boitet & Zaharin, 1988) will be introduced to 
capture a natural language
 text, its corresponding 
abstract linguistic representation and the mapping 
(correspondence) between these two. The 
correspondence between the string and its associated 
representation tree structure is defined in terms of the 
sub-correspondence between parts of the string 
(substrings) and parts of the tree structure (subtrees), 
which can be interpreted for both analysis and 
generation. Such correspondence is defined in a way 
that is able to handle some non-standard cases (e.g. 
non-projective correspondence). 
While synchronous systems are becoming more and 
more popular, there is therefore a great need for 
formal models of corresponding different levels of 
representation structures. Existing synchronous 
systems face a problem of handling, in a 
computationally attractive way, some non-standard 
phenomena exist between NLs. Therefore there is a 
need for a flexible annotation schema to realize 
additional power and flexibility in expressing the 
desired structural correspondences between languages 
(representation structures). 
Many problems in Machine Translation (MT), in 
particular transfer-rules extraction, EBMT, etc., can 
be expressed via correspondences. We will define a 
variant of SSTC called synchronous SSTC (S-SSTC).  
S-SSTC consists of two SSTCs that are related by a 
synchronization relation.  The use of S-SSTC is 
motivated by the desire to describe not only the 
correspondence between the text and its 
representation structure for each language (i.e. SSTC) 
but also the correspondence between two languages 
(synchronous correspondence). For instance, between 
a language and its translation in other language in the 
case of MT. The S-SSTC will be used to relate 
expression of a natural language to its associated 
translation in another language. The interface 
between the two languages is made precise via a 
synchronization relation between two SSTCs, which 
is totally non-directional.  
In this paper, we will present the proposed S-SSTC ? 
a schema well suited to describe the correspondence 
between two languages. The synchronous SSTC is 
flexible and able to handle the non-standard 
correspondence cases exist between different 
languages. It can also be used to facilitate automatic 
extraction of transfer mappings (rules or examples) 
from bilingual corpora. 
 
 
2. STRUCTURED STRING-TREE 
CORRESPONDENCE (SSTC) 
From the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT)1 point of 
view, Natural Language (NL) is considered as a 
correspondence between meanings and texts (Kahane, 
2001). The MTT point of view, even if it has been 
introduced in different formulations, is more or less 
accepted by the whole linguistic community.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this section, we stress on the fact that in order to 
describe Natural Language (NL) in a natural manner, 
three distinct components need to be expressed by the 
linguistic formalisms; namely, the text, its 
corresponding abstract linguistic representation and 
the mapping (correspondence) between these two.   
 
Actually, NL is not only a correspondence between 
different representation levels, as stressed by MTT 
postulates, but also a sub-correspondence between 
them. For instance, between the string in a language 
and its representation tree structure, it is important to 
specify the sub-correspondences between parts of the 
string (substrings) and parts of the tree structure 
(subtrees), which can be interpreted for both analysis 
and generation in NLP. It is well known that many 
linguistic constructions are not projective (e.g. 
scrambling, cross serial dependencies, etc.). Hence, it 
is very much desired to define the correspondence in 
a way to be able to handle the non-standard cases 
(e.g. non-projective correspondence), see Figure 1. 
Towards this aim, a flexible annotation structure 
called Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) 
was introduced in Boitet & Zaharin (1988) to record 
the string of terms, its associated representation 
structure and the mapping between the two, which is 
expressed by the sub-correspondences recorded as 
part of a SSTC.

2.1 The SSTC Annotation Structure   
The SSTC is a general structure that can associate an 
arbitrary tree structure to string in a language as 
desired by the annotator to be the interpretation 
structure of the string, and more importantly is the 
facility to specify the correspondence between the 
string and the associated tree which can be non-
projective (Boitet & Zaharin, 1988). These features 
are very much desired in the design of an annotation 
scheme, in particular for the treatment of linguistic 
phenomena, which are non-standard, e.g. crossed 
dependencies (Tang & Zaharin, 1995).  
Definitions2:   
- An SSTC is a general structure, which is a string in a 
language associated with an arbitrary tree structure; 
i.e. its interpretation structure, and the correspondence 
between the string and its associated tree, which can be 
non-projective; i.e. SSTC is a triple (st, tr, co), where st 
is a string in one language, tr is its associated 
representation tree structure and co is the 
correspondence between st and tr. 
- The correspondence co between a string and its 
representation tree is made of two interrelated 
correspondences: 
a) Between nodes and substrings (possibly 
discontinuous). 
b) Between (possibly incomplete) subtrees and 
(possibly discontinuous) substrings. 
- The correspondence can be encoded on the tree by 
attaching to each node N in the representation tree two 
sequences of INTERVALS called SNODE(N) and 
STREE(N). 
- SNODE(N): An interval of the substring in the string 
that corresponds to the node N in the tree. 
   STREE(N): An interval of the substring in the string 
that corresponds to the subtree having the node N as  
root. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the sentence ?John picks the box 
up? with its corresponding SSTC. It contains a non-
projective correspondence. An interval is assigned to 
each word in the sentence, i.e. (0-1) for ?John?, (1-2) 
for ?picks?, (2-3) for ?the", (3-4) for ?box? and (4-5) 
for ?up?. A substring in the sentence that corresponds 
to a node in the representation tree is denoted by 
assigning the interval of the substring to SNODE of

 These definitions are based on the discussion in (Tang, 1994) and 
Boitet & Zaharin (1988).

the node, e.g. the node ?picks up? with SNODE 
intervals (1-2+4-5) corresponds to the words ?picks? 
and "up" in the string with the similar intervals.The 
correspondence between subtrees and substrings are 
denoted by the interval assigned to the STREE of 
each node, e.g. the subtree rooted at node ?picks up? 
with STREE interval (0-5) corresponds to the whole 
sentence ?John picks the box up?.  
The case depicted in Figure 2, describes how the 
SSTC structure treats some non-standard linguistic 
phenomena.  The particle "up" is featurised into the 
verb "pick" and in discontinuous manner (e.g. "up" 
(4-5)
 in "pick-up" (1-2+4-5)) in the sentence "He 
picks the box up". For more details on the 
proprieties of SSTC, see Boitet & Zaharin (1988). 
3. SYNCHRONOUS SSTC STRUCTURE 
Much of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a 
very natural manner as stating correspondences 
(translations) between layers of representation 
structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996), such as the 
relation between syntax and semantic. An analogous 
problem is to be defined in such a way that expresses 
the correspondence between a language and its 
translations in other languages. Therefore the 
synchronization of two adequate linguistic 
formalisms seems to be an appropriate representation 
for that.   
The idea of parallelized formalisms is widely used 
one, and one which has been applied in many 
different ways. The use of synchronous formalisms is 
motivated by the desire to describe two languages that 
are closely related to each other but that do not have 
the same structures. For example, synchronous Tree 
Adjoining Grammar (S-TAG) can be used to relate 
TAGs for two different languages, for example, for 
the purpose of immediate structural translation in 
machine translation (Abeill? et al,1990), (Harbusch 
& Poller,1996), or for relating a syntactic TAG and 
semantic one for the same language (Shieber & 
Schabes,1990). S-TAG is a variant of Tree Adjoining 
Grammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber & 
Schabes,1990) to characterize correspondences 
between tree adjoining languages. Considering the 
original definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it does 
not restrict the structures that can be produced in the 
source and target languages. It allows the construction 
of a non-TAL (Shieber, 1994), (Harbusch & Poller, 
2000). As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricted 
definition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG for 
isomorphic S-TAG. In this case only TAL can be 
formed in each component. This isomorphism 
requirement is formally attractive, but for practical 
applications somewhat too strict. Also contrastive 
well-known translation phenomena exist in different 
languages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG, 
Figure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).  
Similar limitations also appear in synchronous CFGs 
(Harbusch & Poller,1994).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to these limitations, instead of investigating into 
the synchronization of two grammars, we propose a 
flexible annotation schema (i.e. Synchronous 
Structured String-Tree Correspondence (S-SSTC)) to 
realize additional power and flexibility in expressing 
structural correspondences at the level of language 
sentence pairs. For example, such schema can serve 
as a mean to represent translation examples, or find 
structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer 
grammar learning (Menezes & Richardson, 2001), 
(Aramaki et al, 2001), (Watanabe et al, 2000), 
(Meyers et al, 2000), (Matsumoto et al, 1993), (kaji 
et al, 1992), and example-base machine translation 
EBMT3 (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991), 
(Richardson et al, 2001), (Al-Adhaileh & Tang, 
1999). 
3.1 The Synchronous SSTC 
In this section, we will discuss the definition and the 
formal properties of S-SSTC. A S-SSTC consists of a 
pair of SSTCs with an additional synchronization 
relation between them. The use of S-SSTC is 
motivated by the desire to describe not only the 
correspondence between the text and its 
representation structure in one language (i.e. SSTC) 
but also the correspondence between two languages 
(synchronous correspondence).  
 
Definitions: 
- Let each of S and T be SSTC which consists of a 
triple (st, tr, co), where st is a string in one 
language, tr is its associated representation tree 
structure and co is the correspondence between st 
and tr, as defined in Section 2.1. 
- A synchronous SSTC Ssyn is defined as a triple (S, T, 
( , )? S T ), where ( , )? S T  is a set of links defining the 
synchronization correspondence between S and T at 
different internal levels of the two SSTC structures.   
- A link ? ( , )? S T  can be either of type 
sn
A  or 
st
A  
which defines the synchronous correspondences 
between nodes of tr in S, and nodes of tr in T. 
?
sn
A  records the synchronous correspondences at 
level of nodes  in S and T (i.e. lexical 
correspondences between specified nodes), and

and

-

A is represented by sets of intervals such that: 
?

?Y:STREE correspondence in co of the first

i.e. (iu_jv)?  (ik_jk) which corresponds to an 
incomplete subtree.

SSTC or (ik_jk) = (ik_jk) - (iu_jv)| iu? ik ?  jv? jh : 
i.e. (iu_jv)?  (ik_jk) which corresponds to an 
incomplete subtree. 
- The synchronous correspondence between terminal 
nodes with X:SNODE = Y:STREE will be of both 
sn
A and
st
A correspondence such that 
sn
A =
st
A . 
Note: The synchronous correspondences can be between 
SSTCs that contain non-standard phenomena; i.e. 
featursiation and discontinuity (crossed dependency). In 
these cases the synchronous correspondence is strait 
forward (following the above definitions); e.g. see Figure 4 
and Figure 6. 
The S-SSTC will be used to relate expressions of a 
natural language to its associated translation in 
another language. For convenience, we will call the 
two languages source and target languages, although 
S-SSTC is non-directional. S-SSTC is defined to 
make such relation explicit. Figure 4 depicts a S-
SSTC for the English source sentence ?John picks 
the heavy box up? and its translation in the Malay 
target sentence ?John kutip kotak berat itu?. The 
gray arrows indicate the correspondence between the 
string and it representation tree within each of the 
SSTCs, and the dot-gray arrows indicate the relations 
(i.e. synchronous correspondence) of synchronization 
between linguistic units of the source SSTC and the 
target SSTC.        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the notation used in S-SSTC, Figure 4 
illustrates the S-SSTC for the English sentence ?John 
picks the heavy box up? and its translation in the 
Malay language ?John kutip kotak berat itu?, with 
the synchronous correspondence between them. The 
synchronous correspondence is denoted in terms of 
SNODE pairs for 
sn
A
 and STREE pairs for 
st
A . For 
sn
A each pair is of (
s
sn
A
,
t
sn
A ), where 
s
sn
A is SNODE 
interval/s from the source SSTC and 
t
sn
A
 is SNODE 
interval/s from the target SSTC. As for 
st
A
 each pair is 
of (
s
st
A
,
t
st
A ), where 
s
st
A
 is STREE interval/s from the 
source SSTC and 
t
st
A
 is STREE interval/s from the 
target SSTC. For instance, as depicted in Figure 5, 
the fact that ?picks up? in the source corresponds to 
?kutip? in the target is expressed by the pair 
(
s

t

A )?(1-2+5-6,1-2) under the

4. HANDLING NON-STANDARD CASES 
WITH S-SSTC 
As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard 
phenomena exist between different languages, that 
cause challenges for synchronized formalisms. In this 
Section, we will describe some example cases, which 
are drawn from the problem of using synchronous 
formalisms to define translations between languages 
(e.g. Shieber (1994) cases). Due to lack of space we 
will only brief on some of these non-standard cases 
without going into the details. 
Figure 4 illustrates a case where the English sentence 
has non-standard cases of featurisation, crossed 
dependency and a many-to-one synchronous 
correspondence in ?picks up?. Another case is 
reordering of words in the phrases, which is clear in 
the phrase ?thedet heavyadj boxn? and it corresponding 
phrase ?kotakn beratadj itudet? in the target. 
Figure 5, shows two non-standard cases between 
languages; e.g. French and English. First, the case of 
many-to-one correspondence, where a word (single 
node) in one language corresponds to a phrase 
(subtree) in the other, namely, the adverbial 
?hopefully? is translated into the French phrase ?On 
esp?re que?. Second, a case of argument swap 
(reordering of subtrees) in the English ?Kim misses 
Dale? and its corresponding translation ?Dale 
manqu? a Kim? in French.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6 describes the cases of clitic climbing in 
French and the non-projective correspondence (i.e. 
crossed dependency). It shows the flexibility of SSTC 
and the proposed S-SSTC in handling such popular 
cases.     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7 exemplifies a case where the number of 
nodes in the synchronized SSTCs or subSSTCs is the 
same, but they exhibit different structures. Nodes 
participating in the domination relationship in one 
SSTC may be mapped to nodes neither of which 
dominates the other (i.e. elimination of dominance). 
Another even more extreme relationship between the 
synchronized pair involving inverted correspondences 
is exemplified in Figure 8.

Figure 9, depicts the case when  partial subtree/s from 
the first SSTC has/ve a synchronous correspondence 
with partial subtree/s in the second SSTC. The 
German word ?beschenkte? corresponds to the 
English phrase ?give present? which is a partial 
subtree from the tree rooted by the word ?give? in the 
English SSTC. This synchronous correspondence is 
recorded under the
st
A  where the operation (-: minus) 
is used to calculate the Y:STREE interval/s for the 
partial subtree/s. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. SYNCHRONOUS CORRESPOND-
ENCE CONSTRAINTS BETWEEN 
NATURAL LANGUAGES (NLs) 
As we mentioned in Section 2, in the SSTC the 
correspondences between the surface text and the 
associated representation tree structure are ensured by 
means of intervals; i.e. (X:SNODE, Y:STREE). This 
explicitly indicates which word/s of the text 
correspond/s to which node in the tree. For describing 
a NL using SSTC, a set of constraints were defined to 
govern such correspondences (Lepage, 1994):   
- X:SNODE and Y:STREE intervals are governed by the 
following constraints:  
i) Global correspondence: an entire tree corresponds to 
an entire sentence. 
ii) Inclusion: a subtree which is part of another subtree 
T, must correspond to a substring in the substring 
corresponding to T. 
iii) Membership: a node in a subtree T, must correspond 
to a word which is member of the substring 
corresponding to T.   
In a similar manner, in order to describe the 
synchronous correspondences between NLs using S-
SSTC, we define a set of constraints to govern the 
synchronous correspondences between the different 
NLs.  These constraints will be used to make 
explicitly the synchronous correspondences in a 
natural manner. 
- 
sn
A and 
st
A are governed by the following constraints: 
? Singleness: A node N which has a synchronization 
correspondence, can participate in one and only one A  
?
sn
A , and one and only one A  ?
st
A . This means 
allowing one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many, 
but the mappings do not overlap. 
? Inclusion: Given two

membership constraints if and only if

A  and  
t

?
t
st
A . This means the lexical correspondences are 
always members in the structural correspondences.  
 
? Dominance: Given two subtrees S and T, there is a 
correspondence A  ?
st
A between S and T satisfy the 
dominance constraints if and only if ?  ? STREE(S) 
correspond to ?  ? STREE(T). 
?  Globality: Given a S-SSTC, there must be A ?
st
A  
satisfies the globality constraints between the the root 
node Rs of the entire tree in the first SSTC and the root 
node Rt of the entire tree in the second SSTC, if and 
only if (
s
st
A ,
t
st
A )?
st
A
 such that  
s
st
A = STREE(Rs) : 
INT(String) in the first SSTC, and  
t
st
A = STREE(Rt) : 
INT(String) in the second SSTC. This mean the whole 
tree in the first SSTC corresponds to the whole tree in 
the second SSTC, and the whole string in the first SSTC 
corresponds to the whole string in the second SSTC). 
 
Note that these constraints can be used to license only 
the linguistically meaningful synchronous corr-
espondences between the two SSTCs of the S-SSTC 
(i.e. between the two languages). For instance, when 
building translation units in EBMT approaches 
(Richardson et al, 2001), (Aramaki, 2001), (Al-
Adhaileh &Tang, 1999), (Sato & Nagao, 1990), 
(Sato, 1991), (Sadler & Vendelmans, 1990), etc., 
where S-SSTC can be used to represent the entries of 
the BKB or when S-SSTC used as an annotation 
schema to find the translation correspondences 
(lexical and structural correspondences) for transfer-
rules? extraction from parallel parsed corpus 
(Menezes & Richardson, 2001), (Watanabe et al,

2000), (Meyers et al, 2000), (Matsumoto et al, 1993) 
and (kaji et al, 1992). Note that the grammar 
alignment rules used in (Menezes & Richardson, 
2001) can be reformulated using these constraints to 
construct the transfer mappings from a synchronous 
source-target example.  
Figure 10 shows an example from Menezes and 
Richardson (2001), the logical form for the Spanish-
English pair: (?En Informaci?n del hiperv?nculo, haga 
clic en la direcci?n del hiperv?nculo?, ?Under 
Hyperlink Information, click the hyperlink address?). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recently, the development of machine translation 
systems requires a substantial amount of translation 
knowledge typically embodied in the bilingual 
corpora. For instance, the development of translation 
systems based on transfer mappings (rules or 
examples) that automatically extracted from these 
bilingual corpora. All these systems typically first 
obtain a tree structures (normally a predicate-
argument or a dependency structure) for both the 
source and target sentences. From the resulting 
structures, lexical and structural correspondences 
between the two structures are extracted, which are 
then presented as a set of examples in a bilingual 
knowledge bank (BKB) or transfer rules for 
translation process. 
However, what has so far been lacking is a schema or 
a framework to annotate and express such extracted 
lexical and structural correspondences in a flexible 
and powerful manner. The proposed S-SSTC 
annotation schema can fulfill this need, and it is 
flexible enough to handle different type of relations 
that may happen between different languages? 
structures. S-SSTC very well suited for the 
construction of a BKB, which is needed for the 
EBMT applications. Al-Adhaileh and Tang (2001) 
presented an approach for constructing a BKB based 
on the S-SSTC. 
In S-SSTC, the synchronous correspondence is 
defined in a way to ensure a flexible representation 
for both lexical and structural correspondences: i- 
Node?to?node correspondence (lexical correspond-
ence), which is recorded in terms of pair of intervals 
(Xs,Xt) where Xs and Xt is SNODE interval/s for the 
source and the target SSTC respectively, ii- Subtree?
to?Subtree correspondence (structural correspond-
ence), which
 
is very much needed for relating the two 
different languages at a level higher than the lexical 
level, a level of phrases.  It is recorded in terms of 
pair of intervals (Ys,Yt) where Ys and Yt is STREE 
interval/s for the source and the target SSTC 
respectively. 
Furthermore, the SSTC structure can easily be 
extended to keep multiple levels of linguistic 
information, if they are considered important to 
enhance the performance of the machine translation 
system (i.e. Features transfer). For instance, each 
node representing a word in the annotated tree 
structure can be tagged with part of speech (POS), 
semantic features and morphological features. 
 
 
6. CONCLUSION 
The proposed S-SSTC is not limited for the case 
discussed here (i.e. MT), any system need to describe 
two language structures and the synchronization 
relation between them, can used S-SSTC as 
annotation schema for that. This is for example the 
case for presenting the syntax-semantics interface 
between different languages. S-SSTC is a flexible 
schema, which is able to handle non-standard 
phenomena that may occur between different 
languages. We conclude this paper with some 
interesting observations on the synchronous SSTC:  
i- A natural way to put the representation trees (i.e. a 
text and its translation) in a very fine-grained 
correspondence. 
ii- A natural way to specify bi-directional structural 
transfer, as SSTC is used to specify structural 
analyzers and generators (i.e. bi-directional). 
iii- Synchronous SSTC can be easily extended to 
record the correspondences between more than 
two languages, hopefully with transitive property, 
especially in constructing multilingual knowledge 
banks (MKB) (i.e. synchronization between 
multiple languages).  
iv- Synchronous SSTC inherits from the SSTC the 
independence from the choice of the tree structure 
and linguistic theories. Also the ability of handling 
the non-standard cases in Natural language and 
between different languages.

pondences after applying the constraints.

v- The transfer between two languages, such as 
source and target languages in machine 
translation, can be done by putting directly into 
correspondence large elementary units without 
going through some interlingual representation 
and without major changes to the source and 
target formalisms. 
Also a GUI editor has been implemented for view, 
edit, create and correct the S-SSTC components, as 
illustrated in Figure 11.
