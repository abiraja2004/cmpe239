Abstract
Accurate phenotype mapping will play an im-
portant role in facilitating Phenome-Wide As-
sociation Studies (PheWAS), and potentially
in other phenomics based studies. The Phe-
WAS approach investigates the association be-
tween genetic variation and an extensive range
of phenotypes in a high-throughput manner to
better understand the impact of genetic varia-
tions on multiple phenotypes. Herein we de-
fine the phenotype mapping problem posed
by PheWAS analyses, discuss the challenges,
and present a machine-learning solution. Our
key ideas include the use of weighted Jaccard
features and term augmentation by dictionary
lookup. When compared to string similarity
metric-based features, our approach improves
the F-score from 0.59 to 0.73. With augmenta-
tion we show further improvement in F-score
to 0.89. For terms not covered by the dictio-
nary, we use transitive closure inference and
reach an F-score of 0.91, close to a level suffi-
cient for practical use. We also show that our
model generalizes well to phenotypes not used
in our training dataset.
1 Introduction
There is a wealth of biomedical data available in
public and private repositories (e.g. the database
issue of Nucleic Acids Research (?).) Along with
this explosion of information comes the need to inte-
grate data from multiple sources to achieve sufficient
statistical power for analyses and/or to characterize
phenomena more precisely. This trend manifests it-
self in two primary ways: the formation of large
multi-institution multi-study consortia and public
repositories. Although this situation occurs across
many areas of biomedicine and our techniques are
general, in this paper we will illustrate the ideas with
examples from genetic studies in which we are par-
ticipating.
Consider the National Center for Biotechnol-
ogy Information (NCBI) database of Genotypes
and Phenotypes (dbGaP) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/gap), that was developed to archive and dis-
tribute the results of studies that have investigated
the interaction of genotype and phenotype. This is a
large repository that includes genome-wide associa-
tion studies (GWAS), medical sequencing, molecu-
lar diagnostic assays, as well as association between
genotype and non-clinical traits. Genetic studies
funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
over a certain size are required to submit the ge-
netic and phenotypic data to dbGaP. There are over
130 top-level studies, 1900 datasets, 5600 analyses,
comprising about 125000 phenotypic variables. Un-
fortunately, each study uses its own set of variables,
thus far dbGaP does not attempt to reconcile, match
or harmonize any of these variables. For example,
a variable called ?BMI? in one study and ?Body
Mass Index? in another study are recorded as
different variables. The task of matching or harmo-
nizing these variables falls on each researcher that
obtains dbGaP data from multiple studies.
Similarly, consider a large consortium, such
as the Population Architecture Using Genomics
and Epidemiology (PAGE) network. PAGE
(www.pagestudy.org) is a consortium of four
major studies with the goal of understanding the
19
association of genetic variants with complex dis-
eases and traits across a variety of populations. The
studies that comprise PAGE include: the Women?s
Health Initiative (WHI, www.whiscience.
org/); the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC,
www.crch.org/multiethniccohort/,
www.uscnorris.com/mecgenetics/); the
CALiCo Consortium, comprised in turn of the
Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study
(www.cscc.unc.edu/aric/), the Coronary
Artery Risk In Young Adults (CARDIA) study
(www.cardia.dopm.uab.edu), the Cardio-
vascular Heart Study (www.chs-nhlbi.org/),
the Hispanic Community Health Study
(www.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/), the Strong
Heart Cohort Study, and the Strong Heart Family
Study (strongheart.ouhsc.edu/); and the
Epidemiologic Architecture of Genes Linked to
Environment (chgr.mc.vanderbilt.edu/
eagle/) study, which utilizes genotypic and phe-
notypic data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The
studies of PAGE represent a pool of over 200,000
individuals with genotypic data collected across
multiple race/ethnicities, and an extremely diverse
collection of phenotypic data. Within PAGE there
are numerous analyses and writing groups that
focus on specific diseases. Each group selects
variables relevant to their disease and harmonizes
the variables across studies.
A group within PAGE is investigating a novel
approach to genetic association analysis called a
Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) (?).
This is a different approach compared to the cur-
rent paradigm of Genome Wide Association Stud-
ies (GWAS) (?; ?). GWAS focus on calculating
the association between the variation of hundreds
of thousands of genotyped single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) and a single or small number
of phenotypes. This approach has provided valu-
able information about the contribution of genetic
variation to a wide range of diseases and pheno-
types. A common limitation of GWAS is the in-
vestigation of a limited phenotypic domain. In con-
trast, PheWAS utilizes an extensive range of de-
tailed phenotypic measurements including interme-
diary biomarkers, in addition to prevalent and in-
cident status for multiple common clinical condi-
tions, risk factors, and quantitative traits for compre-
hensively exploring the association between genetic
variations and all PheWAS phenotypes. The inves-
tigation of a broad range of phenotypes has the po-
tential to identify pleiotropy, novel mechanistic in-
sights fostering hypothesis generation, and to define
a more complete picture of genetic variations and
their impact on human diseases.
In order to compare PheWAS results across stud-
ies within PAGE to seek replication for significant
genotype/phenotype associations, an important step
is matching and mapping phenotypes across stud-
ies. As the number and range of phenotypes is
large across studies, manually matching phenotypes
is less than ideal. Therefore, an important step in im-
proving the feasibility of PheWAS studies is to use
computational approaches to map phenotypes across
studies, effectively matching related phenotypes.
Definition Phenotype Mapping is the task of assign-
ing every variable from each participating study to
one out of a set of categories. The categories can be
defined for a given integrated study or consortium,
or can be taken from pre-existing ontologies, such
as PhenX (www.phenx.org).
For one example, consider the variable hypt
from WHI which is described by the text
?Hypertension ever? and the variable
HAE5A from the EAGLE study described by the
text ?Now taking prescribed medicine
for HBP?. To manually match these phenotypes,
a human expert declares these two variables to
be relevant to class ?hypertension?. Table 1
shows additional examples.
The phenotype mapping problem is quite chal-
lenging. First, the variable descriptions are quite
short (around 10 words, often less). Second, map-
ping the variables to a category, such as hyperten-
sion, may require significant background knowledge
(HBP stands for High Blood Pressure, also known
as hypertension). Third, there are large numbers of
variables, so the solution needs to scale gracefully.
In summary, in order to integrate data from public
repositories, such as dbGaP, or from large consortia,
such as the PAGE network, a critical task is to un-
derstand how the available phenotypes relate to each
other. In this paper, we present machine-learning
techniques for phenotype mapping that significantly
20
reduce the burden on researchers when integrating
data from multiple studies.
2 Related Work
From the perspective of biomedical sciences, phe-
notype mapping is a pre-requisite and a generaliza-
tion for the task of phenotype harmonization (?). In
harmonization, a single variable is identified or cal-
culated for each phenotype within each study. This
can only be accomplished for a very limited set of
variables. There is a need, however, to provide
enough information on a much larger set of pheno-
type variables so that researchers can determine the
common denominator version of a measure across
studies. For example, if a researcher is interested
in hypertension status as an outcome, there needs
to be an assessment of how hypertension status was
ascertained in each study. Different approaches in-
clude self-report, clinic-based blood pressure mea-
surement and/or anti-hypertensive medication use.
Only after this information is obtained, along with
other information, such as at what visit was status
assessed and whether the variable is available for
the entire cohort or only a portion of it will the re-
searcher be able to determine what to use in analysis
and how to interpret the findings. The phenotype
mapping task that we address in this paper enables
a researcher to rapidly find all the phenotype vari-
ables that are related to a given category, which then
constitutes the input to the harmonization process.
From the computer science perspective, the task
of phenotype mapping can be seen as an instance of
the problem of entity linkage, which appears in a va-
riety of forms across many contexts, namely record
linkage (?), object identification (?), duplicate de-
tection (?), and coreference (?; ?). That is, the prob-
lem of recognizing when multiple objects (in multi-
ple sources) actually correspond to the same entity.
Record linkage generally consists of three phases:
(1) blocking, where the number of pairs of objects
is reduced, which is critical for large datasets (e.g.,
(?; ?; ?)), (2) field similarity, where the attributes
of an object are compared (e.g., (?; ?; ?; ?; ?), and
(3) record similarity, which weights how different
attributes contribute to the similarity of records as a
whole (e.g., (?; ?)). Machine learning techniques are
used for many of these tasks.
The task of phenotype mapping is related, but dif-
fers from previous incarnations of record linkage. In
our case, the variables are the objects to be mapped.
However, the only attribute of an object is a terse
textual description (cf. Table 1). This makes the
problem harder since, as we will see, string simi-
larity measures are not enough, and term expansion
with additional background knowledge is necessary.
We do not consider blocking techniques in this pa-
per, since the number of phenotypes is in the thou-
sands and an exhaustive O(n2) comparison is still
feasible.
In this paper, we define and present an approach to
phenotype mapping with good experimental perfor-
mance, but there are many opportunities for refine-
ment by incorporating additional techniques from
the record linkage literature.
3 Phenotype Mapping
For the PAGE PheWAS study, phenotypes were first
manually matched, through the creation of 106 phe-
notype classes, in order to bring together related
phenotypes across studies. The following steps were
then used: First, the data from different studies were
filtered independently for any significant associa-
tion results with p < 0.01. Closely related phe-
notypes were then matched up between studies and
assigned to phenotype classes. Finally, phenotypes
from all studies, regardless of association results,
were matched up to the already defined phenotype
classes. In this way, a phenotype that might not
have shown a significant association result for a sin-
gle study, but that matched a phenotype class, would
still be added to the phenotype-class list. To scale up
the process it is important to develop a semi or fully
automatic approach for the task.
Table 1 shows some example phenotypes and
their classification. Class labels were assigned when
we manually matched the phenotypes. The real ID
of a phenotype in a study is given in column ID.
Description will be the main clue for automatic
matching. These examples were chosen to illustrate
unique characteristics that we observed in the manu-
ally matched data set and the challenges of the task.
? The descriptions are in a wide variety of forms.
They may be a compound term, a phrase, a sen-
tence, or even a question, and usually contain

Table 1: Example phenotypes and their classification
less than 10 words, so it is difficult to apply so-
phisticated Natural Language Processing tech-
niques.
? Phenotypes may be related in different ways:
subsumption, overlapping, at the same layer of
semantic hierarchy, etc.
? The granularity of the classes varies. For exam-
ple, we have classes as specifically defined as
Hematocrit, the ratio of the volume of red
blood cells to the total volume of blood. But the
class Allergy covers a wide range of allergy
sources and symptoms. In Table 1, we show
four phenotype variables for allergies against
cats with flare and wheal sizes measured. Sim-
ilar variables include those for allergies of a
wide range of sources: alternaria, bermuda
grass, german cockroach, mite, peanut, rag-
weed, rye grass, Russian thistle, and white oak.
While in the same class, MEC uses a single phe-
notype asthma to cover just about all types of
allergies. On the other hand, phenotypes about
cigarette smoking are distinctively divided into
two categories: cigarettes smoked per day and
currently smoking. As we explained earlier, the
main criterion here is to maximize the chance
to detect unexpected associations, not necessar-
ily to match the most semantically similar phe-
notypes. As a result, directly applying conven-
tional clustering or topic modeling techniques
in Information Retrieval may not be appropri-
ate here.
? Some phenotypes in the same class appear
nearly identical. For example, the three hemat-
22
ocrit phenotypes have almost identical descrip-
tions. HYPER 1, 2 and 3 of the study CHS
in the class Hypertension have exactly the
same descriptions. For those cases, apply-
ing string similarity metrics can easily match
them together. However, some phenotypes
in the same class appear completely different
due to the use of synonyms and abbreviations.
Again in class Hypertension, ?hyperten-
sion,? ?HTN,? ?high blood pressure,? ?HBP,? and
?high BP? are keywords appearing in the de-
scriptions of phenotypes. It is possible for
an effective string similarity metric to recog-
nize abbreviations like ?HTN? for ?hyperten-
sion,? but without additional information there
is no way for a string similarity metric to match
?hypertension? and ?high blood pressure.?
4 Methods
We formulate the task as a problem of learning to
score the degree of match of a pair of phenotypes
based on their descriptions. By setting a threshold
of the score for match or not, the problem reduces to
a standard binary classification problem in Machine
Learning.
We started by performing a pre-processing step of
data cleaning to remove redundant phenotypes with
no description, then pairing the resulting pheno-
types for training and testing in a supervised learn-
ing framework. The data is skewed as most pairs are
negative.
Studies 5 Phenotypes 733
Classes 106 Total pairs 298378
Positives 10906 Negatives 287472
Table 2: Statistics of Data
Another pre-processing step is tokenization,
which was applied to the description of each phe-
notype before we extracted a set of features from
each pairs. The tokenization step includes convert-
ing all uppercase letters to lowercase letters, re-
moving punctuations, segmenting the text into to-
kens, and using Porter?s stemmer (?) to stem to-
kens, removing stop words and digits. For exam-
ple, ?TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK? will
become (transient, ischem, attack). Note
that ?ic? was removed from ?ischemic? by the
stemming process.
The next step is feature extraction. The goal here
is to represent each pair of phenotype variables by
a set of feature values as the input to a machine-
learning model. We considered two types of fea-
tures. The first type is based on string similarity
metrics. The idea is to combine the strength of a va-
riety of string similarity metrics to measure the edit
distance between the descriptions of a pair of pheno-
types and use the result to determine if they match
each other. We chose 16 metrics as shown in Ta-
ble 3. Some of them are sophisticated and designed
for challenging record linkage tasks, such as match-
ing personal records in census data.
Levenshtein Distance
Needleman-Wunch Distance
Smith-Waterman Distance
Smith-Waterman-Gotoh Distance
Monge Elkan Distance Q-grams Distance
Jaro Distance Jaro Winkler
Block Distance Soundex Distance
Matching Coefficient Dice?s Coefficient
Jaccard Similarity Overlap Coefficient
Euclidean Distance Cosine Similarity
Table 3: String similarity metrics
We used the Java implementation provided by
SimMetrics1 to obtain the values of these metrics
given a pair of phenotype descriptions. SimMetrics
also provides descriptions and references of these
string similarity metrics. Each metric is treated as
one feature and normalized into a real value between
0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the two strings are
identical.
These string similarity metrics, however, treat all
words equally but apparently some words are more
important than others when we match phenotypes.
To assign different weights to different words, we
designed a feature set that can be considered as
weighted Jaccard as follows. Let t be a token or
a bi-gram (i.e., pair of consecutive tokens). For each
t there are two features in the feature set of the fol-
lowing forms:
? share-t: if t appears in the pre-processed de-
scriptions of both variables, then its value is 1
1staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.
Chapman/simmetrics.html
23
and 0 otherwise;
? miss-t: if t appears in the pre-processed de-
scription of one variable only, then its value is
1 and 0 otherwise;
For example, suppose we have tokenized variables
V1 = (age, menopause, start), and V2 =
(menopause, start, when), then the features for
this pair will be
(miss-?age? : 1,
share-?menopause? : 1,
share-?start? : 1,
miss-?when? : 1,
miss-?age menopause? : 1,
share-?menopause start? : 1,
miss-?start when? : 1).
All other features will have value 0. In this way,
each example pair of variables will be represented as
a very high-dimensional feature vector of binary val-
ues. The dimensionality is proportional to the square
of the number of all distinct tokens appearing in the
training set.
Now we are ready to train a model by a machine-
learning algorithm using the examples represented
as feature vectors. The model of our choice is the
maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), also known as
logistic regression (?). An advantage of this model
is that efficient learning algorithms are available for
training this model with high-dimensional data and
the model not only classifies an example into posi-
tive or negative but also gives an estimated probabil-
ity as its confidence. The basic idea of logistic re-
gression is to search for a weight vector of the same
dimension as the feature vector such that this weight
vector when applied in the logit function of the prob-
ability estimation of the training examples will max-
imize the likelihood of the positive-negative assign-
ment of the training examples (?). The same model
can also be derived from the principle of maximum
entropy. We randomly selected half of the pairs as
the training examples and the rest as the holdout set
for evaluation.
We used the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictio-
nary (?)2 to augment the descriptions of phenotypes.
If there is an entry for a token in the dictionary,
2www.m-w.com/browse/medical/a.htm
then its definition will be included in the description
and then the same pre-processing and feature extrac-
tion steps will be applied. Pre-processing is also re-
quired to remove useless words from the definitions
in the dictionary. We chose this dictionary instead
of some ontology or phenotype knowledge base for
its quality of contents and comprehensive coverage
of biomedical terms. The Merriam-Webster Med-
ical Dictionary is also chosen as the only medical
dictionary included in the MedlinePlus3, a Web ser-
vice produced by the National Library of Medicine
for the National Institute of Health to provide reli-
able and up-to-date information about diseases, con-
ditions and wellness issues to the patients and their
families and friends.
5 Results
Table 4 shows the results in terms of precision, re-
call, and F-score. The first two rows show the use of
string similarity metrics as features to train a Naive
Bayes model and a MaxEnt model. The F-scores of
both models are similar, but Naive Bayes has higher
false positives while MaxEnt made more false neg-
ative errors. MaxEnt with weighted Jaccard out-
performs one with string-similarity features. Aug-
mentation by dictionary lookup (?w/ dictionary?) is
proved effective by improving recall from 0.59 to
0.82, as more positive mappings were identified for
those phenotype pairs described in different terms.
One may suspect that the augmentation may in-
crease false positives due to incorrectly associating
common words in the descriptions. But remarkably,
the false positives also decreased, resulting in the
improvement in precision as well.
Table 5 shows a set of selected examples to il-
lustrate the effectiveness of augmentation by dictio-
nary lookup. The first column shows the original de-
scriptions of the phenotype variable pairs. The sec-
ond and third columns show the classification results
(0 for negative, 1 for positive) and the confidence
scores by the MaxEnt model without augmentation.
The next two columns are their counterparts for the
model with augmentation.

ter can be matched with overactive thyroid. Sim-
ilarly, it is now possible to match ?High Blood
Pressure? with ?hypertension? and ?TIA?
with ?stroke.? ?DIABETES?, ?GLUCOSE?
and ?Insulin? can also be associated together.
However, terms must be covered in the medical
dictionary for this method to work. For example,
since ?CIGARETTES? is not a medical term and
even the most sophisticated string similarity met-
rics cannot match the local abbreviation ?CIGS?
to ?CIGARETTES?, both models failed to match
?SMOKE? and ?CIGARETTES? together.
A solution to this issue is to compute transitive
closure of the mapping. For example, if
V1 = (SMOKE) and
V2 = (SMOKE CIGARETTES)
are matched together by the model because of a
shared term ?smoke? and so are V2 and
V3 = (cigarettes),
but not V1 and V3, then transitive closure will infer
a match of V1 and V3. That will improve recall and
F-score further.
Figure 1 shows the performance of applying in-
creasing depths of transitive closure to the results
(a) without and (b) with augmentation by dictio-
nary lookup. Transitive closure improves the per-
formance for both models in the beginning but de-
grades quickly afterward because a phenotype may
be assigned to multiple classes. As false positives in-
crease, they will ripple when we infer new positives
from false positives. Improvement for the model (a)
is more obvious and degradation is not as grave. Ap-
plying transitive closure with depth = 1 yields the
best performance. The exact scores are shown in
Table 4 (See ?w/ transitive closure? and ?w/ both?).
The results above were obtained by splitting the
set of all pairs by half into training and test sets.
It is possible that the model remembers phenotype
descriptions because they distribute evenly in both
training and test sets. To apply the system in prac-
tice, the model must generalize to unseen pheno-
types. To evaluate the generalization power, instead
of splitting the set of pairs, we split the set of vari-

with those in the 2/3 set as well as with each other

and 169092 pairs for testing. In this test set, 6356
pairs are positive.
We used this training set to train MaxEnt mod-
els using the weighted Jaccard feature set with and
without dictionary augmentation. Table 6 shows
the results. Again, dictionary augmentation signif-
icantly improves the performance in this case, too,
with the F-score reaching 0.81. Though the results
degrade slightly from the ones obtained by splitting
by pairs, this is expected as the training set is smaller
(129286 pairs vs. 149189 = 298378/2, see Ta-
ble 2). Consequently, the proposed models can gen-
eralize well to unseen phenotypes to some extent.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we define the problem of phenotype
mapping and present a solution by learning to score
and classify pairs of phenotypes. We evaluate our
solution using a data set of manually matched phe-
notypes from the PAGE PheWAS study. We show
that weighted Jaccard features are more effective for
this problem than combining string similarity met-
rics for a MaxEnt model and that dictionary aug-
mentation improves the performance by allowing
matching of phenotypes with semantically related
but syntactically different descriptions. We show
that inferring more positives by depth-one transitive
closure fixes those false negatives due to the lack of
dictionary definitions. Finally, the evaluation results
of splitting-by-variables show that the models gen-
eralize well to unseen variables, which is important
for the solution to be practical.
Our future work includes to apply blocking as a
pre-processing step to keep the number of pairs man-
ageable and to apply active or unsupervised learning
to alleviate the burden of generating training corpora
by manual matching.
