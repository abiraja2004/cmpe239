Abstract 
In this paper we show the 
relation between the "surface 
(morphological) cases" and "deep 
cases" (participants), and the 
possible way to  automate the 
creation of a syntactic diction- 
ary provided with frames contain- 
ing information about deep cases 
and their morphemic counterparts 
of particular lexical items 
(Czech verbs). 
Introduction 
In the project MATRACE I 
(MAchine TRAnslation between 
Czech and English) the first aim 
is to create two parallel text 
corpora (Czech and English), 
morphological ly and syntactically 
tagged. Then it will be possible 
to use these corpora not only for 
creating an MT system but also 
for other l inguistic research, 
needed e.g. for systems of NL 
understanding. For these purposes 
we try to make the syntactic 
representation "broader" so that 
the further work would be easier. 
I Project MATRACE, a research 
project of the Institute of 
Applied and Formal Linguistics 
and the Institute of Theoretical 
and Computational Linguistics, is 
carried out within the IBM Aca- 
demic Initiative project in 
Czechoslovakia. 
In the syntactic representation 
of a sentence, based on depend- 
ency grammar, we will specify not 
only the dependency and syntactic 
roles of the modif ications but 
also their underlying counter- 
parts (i.e. "deep cases"). For 
this sort of tagging we need a 
dictionary with morphological and 
syntactic information, which 
consists of morphological para- 
digms of single words and their 
valency frames containing both 
syntactic and underlying roles of 
their members. As there is no 
such dictionary in machine-rea- 
dable form we have to create it. 
Unfortunately we even cannot 
extract the words with their 
frames from an existing corpus as 
we are only creating it. What we 
have is a morphological diction- 
ary, which is to be enriched by 
the syntactic information. The 
linguist adding this information 
should enter the surface frame 
and specify its underlying coun- 
terpart. We try to help him/her 
by automating the choice of the 
appropr ia te  cor respondence  
between "surface" and "deep" 
cases. 
In this paper we will con- 
centrate on the problems of verb 
and its valency slots. The gener- 
alization of our method for nouns 
and adjectives will not be diffi- 
cult as in many cases the syntac- 
tic frame of these words is just 
derived from the corresponding 
verb.

Theoretical background 
Using the framework of the 
funct ional  generat ive descr ipt ion 
(FGP, see Sgal l  et al 1986), 
s l ight ly  s impl i f ied for the pur- 
pose of this paper, we dist in-  
guish two levels: a level of 
under ly ing  structure (US, with 
the par t i c ipants  or "deep cases") 
and a level of surface structure 
(SS, morphemic  units  as parts of 
this are used here). As for the 
modi f i cat ions  of verbs we dist in-  
guish inner par t ic ipants  and free 
modi f i cat ions  (see Panevov~ 1974- 
5). This can be understood as the 
parad igmat ica l  c lass i f i cat ion of 
all poss ib le  verbal  modi f icat i -  
ons. The other  d imension of their  
c lass i f i cat ion  (combinator ic or 
syntagmat ic  dimension) concerns 
their  ob l igator iness  and opt iona- 
l ity wi th  the part icu lar  lexical 
item wi th in  the verbal  frame. The 
verbal  frame contains slots for 
ob l igatory  and opt ional  inner 
par t i c ipants  (which wi l l  be 
f i l led by the labels for "deep 
cases" and corresponding mor-  
phemic  forms) and obl igatory free 
modi f icat ions.  The d i f ference 
between an obl igatory and 
opt ional  part ic ipant  is important 
for a parser, however, we wil l  
leave this d ichotomy aside in 
this contr ibut ion.  
The fo l lowing operat ional  
cr i ter ia  for d is t ingu ish ing 
between inner par t ic ipants  and 
free modi f i cat ions  are used: If 
the verbal  mod i f i ca t ion  can occur 
only once wi th  a single verb 
token and if the govern ing verbs 
for a par t i cu lar  modi f i cat ion  may 
be listed, the modi f i cat ion  is 
cons idered as an "inner part ic i -  
pant". There are five part ic i -  
pants :  Ac tor ,  Ob jec t ive ,  
Addressee, Or ig in  and Effect. The 
other modi f i cat ions  (Time, 
Locative, Direct ion, Aim, Reason, 
Instrument, Regard, Manner etc.) 
can reoccur  with a s ingle verb 
token and may modi fy  any verb. 
With some verbs free modi f ica-  
t ions can also enter  the respect-  
ive verb frame: e i ther  the con- 
struct ion is ungrammat ica l  with- 
out them (to behave HOW, to last 
HOW LONG, to l ive WHERE etc.) or 
they are semant ica l ly  obl igatory,  
although they can be omitted on 
the SS level. This can be tested 
by a d ia logue of the fo l lowing 
type: 
A. My fr iend came. 
B. Where? 
A. *I don't  know. 
Unacceptabi l i ty  of the answer "I 
don't  know" indicates that the 
modi f icat ion  where is a part  of 
a verbal frame of the verb to 
come. 
Accord ing to the theory 
proposed by Panevov~ (1974-5, 
esp. ? 5) the fo l lowing conse- 
quences are accepted here: If a 
verb has only one inner part ic i -  
pant then this par t i c ipant  is 
Actor. If a verb has two part ic i -  
pants then these are Actor  and 
Objective. As fo~ the l"and 2 ~ 
part ic ipant  our approach is s imi- 
lar to Tesni~re 's  (1959). How- 
ever, if three or even more slots 
of a verbal  frame are occupied 
then semant ic  cons iderat ions  are 
involved. This is d i f fe rent  from 
Tesni~re's  so lut ion and does not 
ful ly coincide with F i l lmore 's  
proposals (Fi l lmore 1968, 1970). 
Determin ing the Addressee, 
Or ig in and Effect is rather  dif-  
f icult and requires tak ing into 
account the combinat ion  of sur- 
face cases in the frame (includ- 
ing the form of the Object ive),  
the animacy of s ingle members  of 
the frame etc. Though there is no 
one-to-one mapping between "deep 
cases" and "surface cases", we 
are able to d iscover  certa in 
regular i t ies  and prov ide some 
genera l i zat ion re f lected in an 
algorithm. 
Observation 
In in f lect ional  languages 
with (morphological) cases it is 
apparent that some cases are 
typical  for certa in part ic ipants .  
Object ive is typ ica l ly  rea l ized 
AcrEs DE COLING-92. NANTES, 23-28 AOtn" 1992 8 8 6 P~OC. OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
as the Accusat ive  and Addressee 
as the Dat ive case. in Czech 
there are other  typical (preposi- 
tional) cases. Thus z+Genit ive 
(out of sb, st) or od+Genit ive 
(from sb, st) ar~ typica l  for 
Origin, ha+Accusat ive (at st), 
do+Genit ive (to st) or v+Accu- 
sative (into sb, st) are typical  
for E f fect  etc. This wel l  known 
fact led us to the idea of creat- 
ing a program as a tool for in~ 
t roduc ing verbal  f rames (to be 
used even by researchers  without  
deep l ingu is t ic  training) based 
on correspondences between sur~ 
face and deep caseE;. At f~rst we 
sorted the Czech v~rb~ into four 
groups: 
i. Verbs  w i thout  Nominat ive  in 
their  frames. 
Examples: 
pr~i 
\[(it) rains\] 
hudl mi (Act (Dat) ) v h lav~ 
\[(it) is buzz ing to me in head\] 
(my head is buzzing) 
This group conta ins  verbs with 
empty f rames but also a few verbs 
with very  untyp ica l  frames. If 
the f rame conta ins  only one par~ 
t ic ipant,  then this is obvious ly  
an Actor. if there are at least 
two par t i c ipants  in the frame and 
one of them is Dative, then this 
is the Actor. If, bes ide this, 
only one more  par t i c ipant  occurs 
in the frame, it is necessar i ly  
the Object ive.  All other verbs 
must be t reated  ind iv idual ly  by 
a l inguist  as a kind of excep~ 
tion. 
2. Verbs  w i th  Nominat ive  and at 
most  one more inner part ic ipant.  
Examples  : 
on (Act (Nora)) zemfel 
\[he died\] 
Jan  (Act  (Nora)) vidfi_ 
rii (ob3 (Ace)) 
\[John sees Mary\] 
ze semene (Obj (Prep (z) 4Gen) ) 
rostl strom (Act (Nora)) 
\[from a seed grew a tree\] 
to(obj (Nora)) se mi (Act (Dat) ) libl 
\[it to me appeals\] (I l ike it) 
Ma~. 
vy ~. 
Acco i 'd i i l%(  to  the the~)~'y, if the 
frame contains'; only one part ic i -  
pant, it is Actor,. if it conta ins  
two part~cipants~ one of them is 
Actor  and the othe~: is Object ive.  
Nominat ive  usua l ly  represents  the 
Actor  but there is an except ion  
to this rule: if the other  par~ 
t ic ipant  is in Dative, then th is  
part ic ipant  is the Actor  and the 
Nominat ive  represents the Objec-  
tive. Reasonab i l i ty  of th is  ex- 
ceptiot| call be proved by t rans-  
lating par t icu lar  verbs  into 
other languages, ~n which  the 
surface frames are d i f fe rent  
whi le  there is no obv ious  reason 
why the deep frames should  d i f -  
fer~ Thus e.g. the verb l ibit  se 
has Nominat ive /C lause  and Dat ive 
in its sur face f rame whi le  in the 
frame of the cor respond ing  Eng- 
l ish verb to l ike there are Sub- 
ject and obj cot/c lause,  where  
subject  corresponds to Czech 
Dat ive and object  to Nominat ive.  
3. Verbs wi th  Nominat ive  and two 
or more other inner par t ic ipants ,  
which occur only in "typical"  
cases (i.e~ Accusat ive,  Dative, 
z+Genit ive, od+Genit ive,  na+Accu-  
sative, do4Accusat ive,  v+Accusa-  
tive) o A verb be longs  to th is  
group even if some of the s lots 
for inner par t i c ipants  can be 
occupied ei ther by a typ ica l  case 
or any other (preposit ional)  case 
o~- a c lause or inf in i t ive.  
Examples -" 
dan (Act  (Nom)  ) da l  Ma-  
rii (Addr (Dat) ) knihu (Obj (Acc) ) 
\[John gave Mary a book\] 
Otec (Act (Nora)) ud~lal  d~ ~o 
tern (Addr(Dat) ) ze 
dfeva (Orig (Prep (z) +Gen) ) pan~d- 
ka (Obj (Ace)) 
\[father made t(~ chi ldren out of 
wood a puppet\] 
The verbs (,f th~ th i rd  group 
behave "typioi~l\]y" v wh ich  means 
that Nominat ive represents  the 
Actor, Accusat ive  the object ive,  
Dat ive the Addressee etCo 
4. othe~', i.eo verbs w i th  Nomi-  
nat ive and twt )  or more other  
A(:H;S DI'; COLINGO2, NANTES, 23-28 aO~\]l 1992 8 8 '/ Pl~ol:. o,. COLING~92, NANI I!S, AU(;. 23-28, 1992 
inner part ic ipants,  which occur 
not only in typical  cases. 
Examples : 
~f  (Act (Nom) ) j menoval Ja- 
na  (Ob j  (Acc)  ) z~s  tup-  
cem (Eff (Instr) ) 
\[boss appointed John a deputy\] 
Jan (Act (Nora)) obkl opil Ma- 
rii (Addr (Acc) ) p~dl (Obj (Instr) ) 
\[John surrounded Mary with care\] 
In this group Nominat ive always 
represents Actor but for deter- 
mining other part ic ipants it is 
necessary to take into account an 
addit ional  aspect, namely the 
prototypical  character of the 
animacy of the part ic ipants;  this 
enables us to d ist inguish the 
d i f ference between deep frames of 
the two last examples jmenovat 
and obklopit. The surface frames 
are identical:  Nominative, Accus- 
ative and Instrumental,  but whi le 
the verb jmenovat has Accusat ive 
standing for the Object ive and 
Instrumental  for the Effect, the 
verb obklopit has Accusat ive 
standing for the funct ion of 
Addressee and In@trumental  for 
the function of Objective. 
Algor i tbmisat ion  
The algor i thms for the verbs 
of the first two groups were 
descr ibed in the previous para- 
graph. 
The possible a lgor i thmiza-  
tion of determining the corre- 
spondences between "surface" and 
"deep" cases of the verbs of the 
last two groups can be seen from 
the fol lowing table of several 
Czech verbs with d i f ferent  
frames: 
Pat Addr Orig Elf 
ud~lat  Acc 
vzlt  Acc (Dat) 
dostat  Acc 
po~adovat  Acc/Cl  
m~nit  Acc (Dat)

We can see that the preposit ional  
cases "typical"  for Origin occur 
only in the pos i t ion of Origin, 
and Dat ive occurs only in the 
posi t ion of Addressee. After 
these members of the surface 
frame are determined, in most 
cases only one undetermined par- 
t ic ipant remains, which must be 
Objective. If two or three par- 
t ic ipants are remain ing we have 
to take into account the animacy

(typical for Addressee) and in- 
an imacy of the par t ic ipants  and 
the set of prepos i t iona l  cases 
which are typica l  for Effect. 
This  a lgor i thm is used in a 
program which reads Czech verbs 
from an input f i le and asks a 
l inguist  (in the interact ive 
regime) to f i l l  in the surface 
verbal  frame. 
conc lus ions  
Some general  l inguist ic  
s tatements  concern ing re lat ions 
between "centre" (prototypes) and 
"per iphery" (marginal ity) in the 
domain of verb  and its valency 
could be in ferred from an appl i -  
cat ion of the rules presented in 
our paper. In "nominat ive" lan- 
guages the verbal  frame ~t  Obj 
Addr  can be cons idered as central  
(while e.g. Aat  (Obj) Addr is not 
typical) .  Moreover,  the corre- 
spondences between US and SS as 
Act  -> Nom, Obj -> Ace, Addr -> 
Dat can be t reated as prototypes 
(while e.g. cor respondences  Act 
-> Datr Addr  -~ Ace, Obj -> Instr 
occur in Czech as marginal) .  The 
strategy of our a lgor i thm is 
based pr inc ipa l ly  on an observa-  
t ion of th is  type. We assume that 
this method can be easi ly  adapted 
for any other  inf lect ional  lan- 
guage and perhaps also for such 
languages as English. Languages 
may d i f fer  as to correspondences 
between a par t icu lar  deep case 
(US) and its surface (morphemic 
form), but the idea of prototypi -  
cal and marg ina l  re lat ions seems 
to be va l id  and is supported by 
the a lgor i thmic  procedure for 
determin ing  these correspon-  
dences.
