Abstract
In this article, we present a simple and ef-
fective approach for extracting bilingual lex-
icon from comparable corpora enhanced with
parallel corpora. We make use of structural
characteristics of the documents comprising
the comparable corpus to extract parallel sen-
tences with a high degree of quality. We then
use state-of-the-art techniques to build a spe-
cialized bilingual lexicon from these sentences
and evaluate the contribution of this lexicon
when added to the comparable corpus-based
alignment technique. Finally, the value of this
approach is demonstrated by the improvement
of translation accuracy for medical words.
1 Introduction
Bilingual lexicons are important resources of many
applications of natural language processing such
as cross-language information retrieval or machine
translation. These lexicons are traditionally ex-
tracted from bilingual corpora.
In this area, the main work involves parallel cor-
pora, i.e. a corpus that contains source texts and their
translations. From sentence-to-sentence aligned cor-
pora, symbolic (Carl and Langlais, 2002), statistical
(Daille et al, 1994), or hybrid techniques (Gaussier
and Lange?, 1995) are used for word and expression
alignments. However, despite good results in the
compilation of bilingual lexicons, parallel corpora
are rather scarce resources, especially for technical
domains and for language pairs not involving En-
glish. For instance, current resources of parallel cor-
pora are built from the proceedings of international
institutions such as the European Union (11 lan-
guages) or the United Nations (6 languages), bilin-
gual countries such as Canada (English and French
languages), or bilingual regions such as Hong Kong
(Chinese and English languages).
For these reasons, research in bilingual lexicon
extraction is focused on another kind of bilingual
corpora. These corpora, known as comparable cor-
pora, are comprised of texts sharing common fea-
tures such as domain, genre, register, sampling pe-
riod, etc. without having a source text-target text
relationship. Although the building of comparable
corpora is easier than the building of parallel cor-
pora, the results obtained thus far on comparable
corpora are contrasted. For instance, good results
are obtained from large corpora ? several million
words ? for which the accuracy of the proposed
translation is between 76% (Fung, 1998) and 89%
(Rapp, 1999) for the first 20 candidates. (Cao and
Li, 2002) have achieved 91% accuracy for the top
three candidates using the Web as a comparable cor-
pus. But for technical domains, for which large
corpora are not available, the results obtained, even
though encouraging, are not completely satisfactory
yet. For instance, (De?jean et al, 2002) obtained a
precision of 44% and 57% for the first 10 and 20
candidates in a 100,000-word medical corpus, and
35% and 42% in a multi-domain 8 million-word
corpus. For French/English single words, (Chiao
and Zweigenbaum, 2002) using a medical corpus
of 1.2 million words, obtained a precision of about
50% and 60% for the top 10 and top 20 candidates.
(Morin et al, 2007) obtained a precision of 51%
and 60% for the top 10 and 20 candidates in a 1.5

million-word French-Japanese diabetes corpus.
The above work in bilingual lexicon extraction
from comparable corpora relies on the assumption
that words which have the same meaning in different
languages tend to appear in the same lexical contexts
(Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999). Based on this assump-
tion, a standard approach consists of building con-
text vectors for each word of the source and target
languages. The candidate translations for a partic-
ular word are obtained by comparing the translated
source context vector with all target context vectors.
In this approach, the translation of the words of the
source context vectors depends on the coverage of
the bilingual dictionary vis-a`-vis the corpus. This
aspect can be a potential problem if too few corpus
words are found in the bilingual dictionary (Chiao
and Zweigenbaum, 2003; De?jean et al, 2002).
In this article, we want to show how this prob-
lem can be partially circumvented by combining a
general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilin-
gual dictionary based on a parallel corpus extracted
through mining of the comparable corpus. In the
same way that recent works in Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) mines comparable corpora to dis-
cover parallel sentences (Resnik and Smith, 2003;
Yang and Li, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005;
Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009, among others),
this work contributes to the bridging of the gap be-
tween comparable and parallel corpora by offering
a framework for bilingual lexicon extraction from
comparable corpus with the help of parallel corpus-
based pairs of terms.
The remainder of this article is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we first present the method for
bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable cor-
pora enhanced with parallel corpora and the associ-
ated system architecture. We then quantify and anal-
yse in Section 3 the performance improvement of
our method on a medical comparable corpora when
used to extract specialized bilingual lexicon. Fi-
nally, in Section 4, we discuss the present study and
present our conclusions.
2 System Architecture
The overall architecture of the system for lexical
alignment is shown in Figure 1 and comprises par-
allel corpus- and comparable corpus-based align-
ments. Starting from a comparable corpus harvested
from the web, we first propose to extract parallel
sentences based on the structural characteristics of
the documents harvested. These parallel sentences
are then used to build a bilingual lexicon through
a tool dedicated to bilingual lexicon extraction. Fi-
nally, this bilingual lexicon is used to perform the
comparable corpus-based alignment. For a word to
be translated, the output of the system is a ranked
list of candidate translations.
2.1 Extracting Parallel Sentences from
Comparable Corpora
Parallel sentence extraction from comparable cor-
pora has been studied by a number of researchers
(Ma and Liberman, 1999; Chen and Nie, 2000;
Resnik and Smith, 2003; Yang and Li, 2003; Fung
and Cheung, 2004; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005;
Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009, among others) and
several systems have been developed such as BITS
(Bilingual Internet Test Search) (Ma and Liberman,
1999), PTMiner (Parallel Text Miner) (Chen and
Nie, 2000), and STRAND (Structural Translation
Recognition for Acquiring Natural Data) (Resnik
and Smith, 2003). Their work relies on the observa-
tion that a collection of texts in different languages
composed independently and based on sharing com-
mon features such as content, domain, genre, regis-
ter, sampling period, etc. contains probably some
sentences with a source text-target text relation-
ship. Based on this observation, dynamic program-
ming (Yang and Li, 2003), similarity measures such
as Cosine (Fung and Cheung, 2004) or word and
translation error ratios (Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk,
2009), or maximum entropy classifier (Munteanu
and Marcu, 2005) are used for discovering parallel
sentences.
Although our purpose is similar to these works,
the amount of data required by these techniques
makes them ineffective when applied to specialized
comparable corpora used to discover parallel sen-
tences. In addition, the focus of this paper is not to
propose a new technique for this task but to study
how parallel sentences extracted from a compara-
ble corpus can improve the quality of the candidate
translations. For theses reasons, we propose to make
use of structural characteristics of the documents
comprising the comparable corpus to extract auto-

In fact, specialized comparable corpora are gener-
ally constructed via the consultation of specialized
Web portals. For instance, (Chiao and Zweigen-
baum, 2002) use CISMeF1 for building the French
part of their comparable corpora and CliniWeb2 for
the English part, and (De?jean and Gaussier, 2002)
use documents extracted from MEDLINE3 to build a
German/English comparable corpus. Consequently,
the documents collected through these portals are
often scientific papers. Moreover, when the lan-
guage of these papers is not the English, the paper
usually comprises an abstract, keywords and title in
the native language and their translations in the En-
glish language. These characteristics of scientific
paper is useful for the efficient extraction of parallel
sentences or word translations from the documents
forming a specialized comparable corpus for which
one part will inevitably be in English.
In this study, the documents comprising the
French/English specialized comparable corpus were
1http://www.chu-rouen.fr/cismef/
2http://www.ohsu.edu/cliniweb/
3http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed
taken from the medical domain within the sub-
domain of ?breast cancer?. These documents have
been automatically selected from the Elsevier web-
site4 among the articles published between 2001 and
2008 for which the title or the keywords of the arti-
cles contain the multi-word term ?cancer du sein? in
French and ?breast cancer? in English. We thus col-
lected 130 documents in French and 118 in English
and about 530,000 words for each language. Since
the 130 French documents previously collected are
scientific papers, each document contains a French
abstract which is accompanied by its English trans-
lation. We exploit this structural characteristic of the
French documents in order to build a small special-
ized parallel corpus directly correlated to the sub-
domain of ?breast cancer? involved in the compara-
ble corpus.
2.2 Parallel Corpus-Based Alignment
We use the Uplug5 collection of tools for alignment
(Tiedemann, 2003) to extract translations from our
4http://www.elsevier.com
5http://stp.ling.uu.se/cgi-bin/joerg/
Uplug
29
specialized parallel corpus. The output of such a tool
is a list of aligned parts of sentences, that has to be
post-process and filtered in our case. We clean the
alignment with a simple yet efficient method in order
to obtain only word translations. We associate every
source word from a source sequence with every tar-
get word from the target sequence. As an example,
uplug efficiently aligns the English word breast can-
cer with the French word cancer du sein (the data
are described in Section 3.1). We obtain the follow-
ing lexical alignment:
? cancer (fr) ? (en) breast, cancer
? du (fr) ? (en) breast, cancer
? sein (fr) ? (en) breast, cancer
With more occurrences of the French word can-
cer, we are able to align it with the English words
{breast, cancer, cancer, cancer, the, of, breast, can-
cer}. We can then filter such a list by counting the
translation candidates. In the previous example, we
obtain: cancer (fr) ? breast/2, the /1, of/1, can-
cer/4. The English word cancer is here the best
match for the French word cancer. In many cases,
only one alignment is obtained. For example, there
is only one occurrence of the French word chromo-
some, aligned with the English word chromosome.
In order to filter translation candidates, we keep
1:1 candidates if their frequencies are comparable
in the original corpus. We keep the most frequent
translation candidates (in the previous example, can-
cer) if their frequencies in the corpus are also com-
parable. This in-corpus frequency constraint is use-
ful for discarding candidates that appear in many
alignments (such as functional words). The criterion
for frequency acceptability is:
min(f1, f2)/max(f1, f2) > 2/3
with f1 and f2 the frequency of words to be aligned
in the parallel corpus.
By this way, we build a French/English special-
ized bilingual lexicon from the parallel corpus. This
lexicon, called breast cancer dictionary (BC dictio-
nary) in the remainder of this article, is composed of
549 French/English single words.
2.3 Comparable Corpus-Based Alignment
The comparable corpus-based alignment relies on
the simple observation that a word and its translation
tend to appear in the same lexical contexts. Based
on this observation, the alignment method, known as
the standard approach, builds context vectors in the
source and the target languages where each vector
element represents a word which occurs within the
window of the word to be translated (for instance a
seven-word window approximates syntactic depen-
dencies). In order to emphasize significant words
in the context vector and to reduce word-frequency
effects, the context vectors are normalized accord-
ing to association measures. Then, the translation is
obtained by comparing the source context vector to
each translation candidate vector after having trans-
lated each element of the source vector with a gen-
eral dictionary.
The implementation of this approach can be car-
ried out by applying the four following steps (Fung,
1998; Rapp, 1999):
1. We collect all the lexical units in the context of
each lexical unit i and count their occurrence
frequency in a window of n words around i.
For each lexical unit i of the source and the
target languages, we obtain a context vector vi
which gathers the set of co-occurrence units j
associated with the number of times that j and
i occur together occ(i, j). In order to iden-
tify specific words in the lexical context and to
reduce word-frequency effects, we normalize
context vectors using an association score such
as Mutual Information (MI) or Log-likelihood,
as shown in equations 1 and 2 and in Table 1
(where N = a + b + c + d).
2. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the
lexical units of the source context vector. If the
bilingual dictionary provides several transla-
tions for a lexical unit, we consider all of them
but weight the different translations according
to their frequency in the target language.
3. For a lexical unit to be translated, we com-
pute the similarity between the translated con-
text vector and all target vectors through vector
distance measures such as Cosine or Weighted
30
Jaccard (WJ) (see equations 3 and 4 where
associj stands for ?association score?).
4. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are
the target lexical units ranked following the
similarity score.
j ?j
i a = occ(i, j) b = occ(i,?j)
?i c = occ(?i, j) d = occ(?i,?j)
Table 1: Contingency table
MI(i, j) = log a(a + b)(a + c) (1)
?(i, j) = a log(a) + b log(b) + c log(c)
+d log(d) + (N) log(N)
?(a + b) log(a + b)
?(a + c) log(a + c)
?(b + d) log(b + d)
?(c + d) log(c + d)

This approach is sensitive to the choice of param-
eters such as the size of the context, the choice of
the association and similarity measures. The most
complete study about the influence of these param-
eters on the quality of bilingual alignment has been
carried out by Laroche and Langlais (2010).
3 Experiments and Results
In the previous section, we have introduced our com-
parable corpus and described the method dedicated
to bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable cor-
pora enhanced with parallel corpora. In this sec-
tion, we then quantify and analyse the performance
improvement of our method on a medical compara-
ble corpus when used to extract specialized bilingual
lexicon.
3.1 Experimental Test bed
The documents comprising the French/English spe-
cialized comparable corpus have been normalised
through the following linguistic pre-processing
steps: tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, and lem-
matisation. Next, the function words were removed
and the words occurring less than twice in the
French and the English parts were discarded. Fi-
nally, the comparable corpus comprised about 7,400
distinct words in French and 8,200 in English.
In this study, we used four types of bilingual dic-
tionary: i) the Wiktionary6 free-content multilin-
gual dictionary, ii) the ELRA-M00337 professional
French/English bilingual dictionary, iii) the MeSH8
metha-thesaurus, and iv) the BC dictionary (see Sec-
tion 2.2). Table 2 shows the main features of the dic-
tionaries, namely: the number of distinct French sin-
gle words in the dictionary (# SWs dico.), the num-
ber of distinct French single words in the dictionary
after projection on the French part of the compara-
ble corpus (# SWs corpus), and the number of trans-
lations per entry in the dictionary (# TPE). For in-
stance, 42% of the French context vectors could be
translated with the Wiktionary (3,099/7,400).

In bilingual terminology extraction from special-
ized comparable corpora, the terminology refer-
ence list required to evaluate the performance of
the alignment programs are often composed of 100
single-word terms (SWTs) (180 SWTs in (De?jean
and Gaussier, 2002), 95 SWTs in (Chiao and
Zweigenbaum, 2002), and 100 SWTs in (Daille and
Morin, 2005)). To build our reference list, we se-
lected 400 French/English SWTs from the UMLS9

meta-thesaurus and the Grand dictionnaire termi-
nologique10. We kept only the French/English pair
of SWTs which occur more than five times in each
part of the comparable corpus. As a result of filter-
ing, 122 French/English SWTs were extracted.
3.2 Experimental Results
In order to evaluate the influence of the parallel
corpus-based bilingual lexicon induced from the
comparable corpus on the quality of comparable cor-
pus based-bilingual terminology extraction, four ex-
periments were carried out. For each experiment,
we change the bilingual dictionary required for the
translation phase of the standard approach (see Sec-
tion 2.3):
1. The first experiment uses only the Wiktionary.
Since the coverage of the Wiktionary from the
comparable corpus is small (see Table 2), the
results obtained with this dictionary yield a
lower boundary.
2. The second experiment uses the Wiktionary
added to the BC dictionary. This experiment
attempts to verify the hypothesis of this study.
3. The third experiment uses the Wiktionary
added to the MeSH thesaurus. This experiment
attempts to determine whether a specialised
dictionary (in this case the MeSH) would be
more suitable than a specialized bilingual dic-
tionary (in this case the BC dictionary) directly
extracted from the corpus.
4. The last experiment uses only the ELRA dic-
tionary. Since the coverage of the ELRA dic-
tionary from the comparable corpus is the best
(see Table 2), the results obtained with this one
yield a higher boundary.
Table 3 shows the coverage of the four bilin-
gual lexical resources involved in the previous ex-
periments in the comparable corpus. The first col-
umn indicates the number of single words belong-
ing to a dictionary found in the comparable cor-
pus (# SWs corpus). The other column indicates
the coverage of each dictionary in the ELRA dic-
tionary (Coverage ELRA). Here, 98.9% of the sin-
gle words belonging to the Wiktionary are included
10http://www.granddictionnaire.com/
in the ELRA dictionary whereas less than 95% of
the single words belonging to the Wiktionary+BC
and Wiktionary+MeSH dictionaries are included in
the ELRA dictionary. Moreover, the MeSH and BC
dictionaries are two rather distinct specialized re-
sources since they have only 117 single words in
common.
Table 3: Coverage of the bilingual lexical resources in the
comparable corpus
Name # SWs Coverage

Wiktionary 3,099 98.8%
Wiktionary + BC 3,326 94.8%
Wiktionary + MeSH 3,465 94.9%
ELRA 4,567 100%
In the experiments reported here, the size of the
context window n was set to 3 (i.e. a seven-word
window), the association measure was the Mutual
Information and the distance measure the Cosine
(see Section 2.3). Other combinations of parameters
were assessed but the previous parameters turned out
to give the best performance.
Figure 2 summarises the results obtained for the
four experiments for the terms belonging to the ref-
erence list according to the French to English direc-
tion. As one could expect, the precision of the re-
sult obtained with the ELRA dictionary is the best
and the precision obtained with the Wiktionary is the
lowest. For instance, the ELRA dictionary improves
the precision of the Wiktionary by about 14 points
for the Top 10 and 9 points for the top 20. These
results confirm that the coverage of the dictionary is
an important factor in the quality of the results ob-
tained. Now, when you add the BC dictionary to
the Wiktionary, the results obtained are also much
better than those obtained with the Wiktionary alone
and very similar to those obtained with the ELRA
dictionary alone (without taking into account the top
5). This result suggests that a standard general lan-
guage dictionary enriched with a small specialized
dictionary can replace a large general language dic-
tionary.
Furthermore, this combination is more interesting
than the combination of the MeSH dictionary with
32
the Wiktionary. Since the BC dictionary is induced
from the corpus, this dictionary is directly correlated
to the theme of breast cancer involved in the cor-
pus. Consequently the BC dictionary is more suit-
able than the MeSH dictionary i) even if the MeSH
dictionary specializes in the medical domain and ii)
even if more words in the comparable corpus are
found in the MeSH dictionary than in the BC dic-
tionary.
This last observation should make us relativize the
claim: the greater the number of context vector el-
ements that are translated, the more discriminating
the context vector will be for selecting translations
in the target language. We must also take into ac-
count the specificity of the context vector elements
in accordance with the thematic of the documents
making up the corpus studied in order to improve
bilingual lexicon extraction from specialized com-
parable corpora.

4 Conclusion and Discussion
In this article, we have shown how the quality of
bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable cor-
pora could be improved with a small specialized
bilingual lexicon induced through parallel sentences
included in the comparable corpus. We have eval-
uated the performance improvement of our method
on a French/English comparable corpus within the
sub-domain of breast cancer in the medical domain.
Our experimental results show that this simple bilin-
gual lexicon, when combined with a general dic-
tionary, helps improve the accuracy of single word
alignments by about 14 points for the Top 10 and 9
points for the top 20. Even though we focus here
on one structural characteristic (i.e. the abstracts)
of the documents comprising the comparable corpus
to discover parallel sentences and induced bilingual
lexicon, the method could be easily applied to other
comparable corpora for which a bilingual dictionary
can be extracted by using other characteristics such
as the presence of parallel segments or paraphrases
in the documents making up the comparable corpus.
