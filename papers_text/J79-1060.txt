Whife Ol ive  throws away t h e  o r i g i n a l  p i t c h  contour of each word, t h e

The IMSSS group u s e s  the  ideas of Leben (1976),  who r e l a t e s

and English as having a suprasegmental melody which is  combined with 
the  segmental phonolbgical elements.  The IMSSS group (Levine, 1976: 3 )  
defines melody as a sequence of "auto segmental tones (autonomous from 
t-he phonological  segments) s e l e c t e d  from t h e  t ona l  r e p e r t o i r e  of the  
language." These tones are treated t h e o r e t i c a l l y  as  d i s c r e t e  fundamental

A. I n t u i t i v e  Presentation of Some Test  Sentences 
v 1 Consider the sefitence "John d r o v e  t o  t h e  s t o r e .  This sentence 
can be read several d i f f e r e n t  ways depending on t h e  d i s c o u r s e  context ,  
Figure 1 shows f i v e  poss ib le  readings and t h e i r  context .  Whatever system 
is used t o  represent the l i n g u i s t i c s  of this sentence,  i t  should be 
poss ib le  t o  represent  each of these f o u r  readings uniquely .  
Sentence  P o s s i b l e  c o n t e x t  
l a  John drove t o  the s t o r e .  What happened? 
Ib John drove t o  the store. Who drove t o  the s t o r e ?  
l c  John drove t o  the s t o r e .  Row d i d  John p e t  t o  t h e  store. 
I d  John drove t o  t h e  store. Where d i d  John drive? 
ie John drove to the s t o r e ?  John drove to the - , tore ,  you know. 
(Are you s u r e  that's what 
you meant t o  say?)  
Figure 1. John drove to the store. 
Now consider the q u e s t i o n  "Did John or Mary come?" Suppose 
t h a t  you heard someone come in but you d i d  n o t  see who it was. 
Nevertheless, you a re  sure t h a t  i t  was e i t h e r  John or Mary,  I n  t h i s  
c o n t e x t ,  you would p u t  stress on "John" and on "Mary" and a f a l l i n g  
pitch a t  t h e  end of t he  sentencze. Then you would expect a r e p l y  of 
"John" o r  "Mary." ( I f  you receive as a reply s imply  "yes" then t he  
p e r s o n  responding e i t h e r  d i d  n o t  understand or is t r y i n g  to b e  f u n n y . )  
On t h e  o t h e r  hand, suppose  a whole crowd came to a p a r t y  and you have 
a message which you must d e l t v e r  to e i t h e r  John o r  Mary. In t h i s  c o n t z x t ,  
you may o r  may not stress "John" and "Mary" but  you would c e r t a i n l y  end 
t h e  s en t ence  w i t h  a r i s i n g  p i t c h .  Then you would expect  a ~ e s / n o  r e p l y ,  
o r  perhaps a yes /no  wi th  a d d i t i o n a l  vo lun tee red  in format ion  such as 
"Yes, John is over t h e r e  i n  t h e  corner . I 1  A g a i n ,  w e  would like our  
system of  r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  to handle  this d i s t i n c t i o n .  The two readings 
of "Did John or Mary come?" are summarized In Figure 2. 
Sentence 
2a D l d  John or Mary come? 
(falling p i t c h  a t  end) 
2b Did John or Mary come? 
P o s s i b l e  Response 
John came, 
Yes, t h e y  are  both here. 
( r i s i n g  p i t c h  at end) 
Figure 2. Did John or Mary come? 
F i n a l l y ,  consider t h e  sentence "The boys who s t u d y  get good 
g rades . "  Idhat difference i n  meaning i s  t h e r e  1n s t r e s s i n g  "study" a s  
opposed t o  stressiqg "boys"7 The d i f f e r e n c e  can be i l l u s t r a t e d  by  
expanding t h e  s e n t e n c e  t o  "The boys who study g e t  good g r a d e s  but  t h e  
o t h e r s  do no t  ." I f  "study" i s  stressed, "others" i s  i n t e r p r e t e d  as 
"boys", namely the boys who do n o t  study. I f ,  however, "boys" is 
stressed, "others" may no longer  be in te rpre ted  as "boys," but  it can 
b e  i n t e r p r e t e d  as "girlst' o r  '"men who study" o r  some other group of 
s t u d e n t s  i n  c o n t r a s t  w i t h  boys. Once again, our  system of representation 
needs t o  handle this d i s t i n c t i o n ,  and handle i t  i n  a way c o n s t s t e n t  
with the t reatment  of o t h e r  d i s t i n c t i o n s .  Three r ead ings  o f  t h i s  sen- 
tetlce are summarized in Figure 3 .  
Sentence Possible con t inua t ion

B. Junc t ion  Grammar Representa t ions  of  the Same Sentences 
We now d i s c u s s  how J u n c t i o n  Grammar represents t h e  above 
d i s t i n c t i o n s  i n  its r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s .  If the r e a d e r  i s  n o t  as y e t

Apperidix A before  roeading this s e c t i o n .  A s  i n d i c a t e d  therein, some 
recent refinements of Junc t ion  Grammar are not y e t  available i n

t h e  sentence "I saw a l o s t  c h i l d  wi th  a scraped knee t h i s  morning, and

i n t o  o u r  memory a s l o t  f o r  a ch i ld  who wqs l o s t .  The junc t ion  between 
"a" and "chi ld"  would b e  N ("a") *-  N ("child") , I f  w e  n e x t  read the 
sentence,  "The c h i l d  had been crying f o r  two hours ,  the poor th ing ,"  w e  
would recover the s l o t  f o r  the child and add to it the information that 
he had been cry ing .  The j unc t ion  between "the" and "chi ld"  i n  this c a s e  
would b e  N ("the") * *  N ("child") .  The t h i r d  type  of subjunc t ion  (**.) 
woilld be  used, f o r  example, in the  sentence "John, our mailman, i s  
going t o  retire m March," t o  show t h a t  t'John,'t and "our mailman" are

n o n - r e s t r i c t i v e  d i s t i n c t i o n )  . 
In the above examples, we considered full subjunct ions ,  (e.g. 
"John, our mailman") but the same s p e c i a l i z a t i o n s  apply t o  interjunctfons, 
(e.g. "John, xho i s  our mailman"). In  a normal, restrictive modi f i ca t ion ,  
a l e f t  subjunct ion i s  used.  For example i n ,  "Please give The t h e  yellow 
book on the second s h e l f , "  "yellow'1 and "book" would be joined a s  
follows (Pig. 5) .

In  t h e  sentence  "Of Tom, John and Rudolph, - John drove t o  the

the prev ious  example. A c t u a l l y  i n  t h i s  case,  "John" restricts the scope

the  computer implementation uses the trees in t h e i r  f u l l  form. 
Having desc r ibed  the J-tree and A-tree for the neutral form of 
"John drove t o  the  s to re , "  w e  now consider how t h e  trees d i f f e r  for the 
four other versions shown i n  Figure 1. I n  vers ions  b, c and d we stress 
"John," "drove" and "to the s t o r e t t  r espec t ive ly .  T h i s  stregs is the 
r e f l e c t t o n  of an implicit frame I1 modifier  i n  the  J-tree (see Figure

drove t o  the s tore?" ,  "~ohn"  is i m p l i c i t l y  modified by a right in te r junc-  
tion which indicates t h a t  John has been se lected out of a set of 
poss ib i l i t i e s .  A possible explicit frame I1 modifier would be: 
"Of t he  persons who ~ight have gone t o  the  s t o r e ,  John drove

A t  this point, it is worrh Ciscussing a very general r e l a t i o n s h i p

11. METHOD 
The model described in Section I provides a representation for  
the semantico-syntactic information underlying prosodic contrasts and a 
very f l ex ib le  framework for representing phrasing and prosodic features 
at the general articulatory l e v e l .  But we have not ye t  s p e d f i e d  how a 
J-tree i s  recoded as an A-tree or how the p i t ch  ,contour  is actually 
obtained from the A-tree. This chapter will describe the computer 
algorithms that have been implemented td perform these two conversions. 
Of course, they should not be taken as any kind of f iml  statement 
concerning the task as they are under continuing development. 
A. Recoding a J-tree as an A-tree 
The general form of the A-tree is obtained by traversing the 
J-tree according t o  the language specific order stored i n  the J-tree. A t  
each node the algorithm decides whether or not to declare a phrase, thus 
allowing nested phrases. The criteria for  declaring a phrase are: 
(1) The topmost node of the  J-tree defines a phrase. 
(2) If the ptedicate consists of more than a single vexb and a single 
object ,  the verb and object w i l l  be made into a phrase which 
w i l l  then be joined to  the subject. 
(3) The cantents of each subordinate tree of the J-tree (which is e 
forest of trees), is  phrased under the dominating tree. 
(4) Each operand of a conjunction forms a phrase. 
The assignment of prosodic features t o  the A-tree (f .e. [+ stress] , 
[+ un~inished  phrase] , and [+ verify contour] ) i s  fairly strsightf orward. 
The c r i t e r i a  f o r  a s s ign ing  [+ stress] t o  a node are: 
(1) A Frame XI f e a t u r e  i n  the J-tree, 
(2)  A l e f t  o r  r i g h t  hyphen sub j unct ion  ( i n d i c a t i n g  remainder) ,  
(3) The operands of an "OR" i n t e r r o g a t i v e .  
Tne d i r e c t i o n a l i t y  of t h e  subjunct ions  between n-cons t i tuents  
i n  t h e  A-tree Is left except i n  t h e  fol lowing s i t u a t i o n s :  
(1) There i s  a r i g h t  subjunct ion  between t h e  A-tree phrases from 
a simple verb and i t s  complex o b j e c t  i n  the J-tree, 
(2)  I f  a phrase i s  marked [+ s t r e s s ] ,  t h e  sub-phrases of the phrase 
are subordinated t o  i t  by a d j u s t i n g  t h e  d i r e e t i o n a l i t i e s  of the 
sub junot ions  . 
B. Background of t h e  A-tree t o  P i t c h  Contour Algorithm 
With t h i s  overview of the  J - t r e e  t o  A-tree conversion a lgor i thm,  
w e  desc r ibe  an algorithm t o  o b t a i n  a p i t c h  contour from an A-tree. The 
evolutionary phases i n  the development of t h i s  a lgori thm were: 
Plots.  We p l o t t e d  p i t ch  ahd i n t e n s i t y  aga ins t  time f o r  various readings  
of s e v e r a l  sentences .  
Manual Contours. I n  order t o  determine which a s p e c t s  of t h e  p i t c h  contour 
are essential t o  natural-sounding synthesis, we programmed a system t o  
allow manual s p e c i f i c a t i o n  of t h e  p i  teh contour with linear i n t e r p o l a t i o n  
between s p e c i f i e d  points  and t o  then penni t  l i s t e n i n g  comparison of 
s y n t h e s i s  outputs  with n a t u r a l  versus manual contours.  
F i r s t  Algorithm. Based QXI these i n i t i a l  experiments ,  we programmed a 
simple p i t c h  contour a lgor i thm that imposed on each phrase  a contour 
s e l e c t e d  from a f f x e d  inven to ry  of con tours  and algebraically added in a 
pitch "bubble" t o  t h e  syllable of  a p rosod ica l ly  s t r e s s e d  V3. In this 
i n i t i a l  system we were a b l e  t o  c r e a t e  m u l t i p l e  readings of sentences  
l ike  "John drove 'to the store" from a s i n g l e  set of LPC analysis parame- 
ters, varying only the p i t c h  contour.  I n  other words, w e  concluded t h a t  
although the perceptual phenomenon c a l l e d  prosodic o r  suprasegmental 
stress is  well-known t o  be based on several a c o u s t i c  parameters ,  including 
p i t c h  (i.e. fundamental frequency), i n t e n s i t y  and du ra t ion ,  i n  st least  
some cases ,  changing only  t h e  p i t c h  contour  is s u f f i c i e n t  t o  cause a word 
t o  be  perceived as s t r e s s e d  or not s t r e s s e d .  However, a f t e r  considerable 
t h e o r e t i c a l  d i s cus s ions ,  we  decided t o  abandon the approach of us ing  a 
fixed inventory  of p ro to type  contours  and try a more dynamic approach, 
which we  w i l l  now desc r ibe .  
C. Current A-tree t o  P i tch  Contour Algorithm 
Given an A-tree and an o p t i o n  code t o  i n d i c a t e  i n i t i a l  and f i n a l  
va lues  and bounds on parameters ,  the a lgor i thm a s s i g n s  an i n i t i a l  and 
f i n a l  p i t c h  basea on the op t ion  code. Then t h e  A-tree i s  t r ave r sed  i n  
l e f t - r i g h t  order. Upon encounter ing each V 3 ,  we a s s i g n  a p i t c h  t o  t h e  
co re  of its nuczear syllable as fol lows:  
(1) The f i x s t - V 3 ' r e c e i v e s  the i n i t i a l  p i t c h  of the sentence.  
(2) A left sub junc t ion  causes  a r a t i o  decrement (about 0.90) t o  the 
last assigned pitch. 
(3) A right sub junc t ion  causes a r a t i o  increment (about 1,12) in 
r e l a t i o n  t o  the l a s t  assYgned pifch.  
34 
(4) A conjunct ion causes no change t o  d a t e ,  b u t  f u r t h e r  r e sea rch  
i b  needed. 
(5) An B-const i tuent  domxpstlng m u l t i p l e  V3's rekeives  the average 
of t h e  most r e c e n t l y  ass igned p i t c h  level  and the highest p i t c h  
ass igned t o  any of i t s  operands. 
Then the  contiaurs between nuc lea r  s y l l a b l e s  a r e  defined a s  
v a l l e y s  whose depth i nc reases  w i t h  t h e  d i s t a n c e  i n  time between t h e  
nuc lea r  s y l l a b l e s  i t  j o i n s .  Af te r  t h e  i n i t i a l  contour i s  def ined,  twc. 
types  of contour adjhstments a re  added: 
(1) ~djustments i n  t h e  p i t c h  contbur caused by s t o p  consonants. 
W e  c a l l  t h e s e  s t o p  d iscontAnui t ies  because when the speech,waveform 
becomes voiced again  a f t e r  a s t o p ,  t h e  p i t c h  i s  s i g n i f i c a n t l y  h igher  than 
when the s t o p  began bu t  soon se t t les  down t o  a v a l u e  which would b e  
p red ic ted  by smooth i n t e r p o l a t i o n  ctf the p i t c h  contour over the unvoiced 
segment. 
(2) The p i t c h  "bubble" assoc ia ted  wi th  a s t r e s s e d  V 3 .  
Although the  above a lgor i thm is not  complete, it works 
reasonably w e l l  and does have one a l ready  mentioned aspec t  which w e  
r e p e a t  h e r e  f o r  emphasis : The ,p i t ch  contour i s  generated from t h e  A-tree 
i n  a completely dynamic manner. That is ,  t he re  is no f ixed  inventory of 
p i t c h  l e v e l s  o r  phrase contours .  Each new p i t c h  l e v e l  i s  assigned r e l a t i v e  
t o  previous va lues  assigned and i n  accordance w i t h  preassigned abso lu t e  
p i t c h  limits ( egg .  60 Hz'and 200 Hz) and t h e  o v e r a l l  s t r u c t u r e  of the 
A-tree. This means t h a t ,  a l though we have s o  far  r e s t r i c t e d  ourse lves  t o  
c a r e f u l l y  spoken speech, t h i s  system may have the f l e x i b i l i t y  t o

D. Sample Pi t ch  Contours 
To conclude this chapter w e  present some graphs of pi tch  contours 
for the sentence "The boys who study get  good grades." Figure 1 7  shows a 
natural, a rule-generated and a manual pi tch  contour for sentence 3b 
("The boys who study g e t  good grades"). Figure 18 shows a natural and a 
rule generated pitch contour for sentence 3c ("The boys who study ge t  
good grades"). Note that these two contours ar imposed on the same s e t  
of LPC analysis  parameters to  produce the two readings. Figure 18 also 
shows a rule generated and a natural contodr for  "The cat  that the dog 
chased got away. I1

111. EVALUATION AFD DISCUSSION 
W e  produced a demonstration tape of LPC synthes ized speech using 
n a t u r a l ,  monotone, and rule-generated p i t c h  contours.  Figure 19 shows 
the conten t s  of the tape.  Various s u b j e c t s  s a i d  that although the  sen tences  
wi th  rule-generated p i t c h  contours did not  sound as n a t u r a l  as the  n a t u r a l  
vers ions ,  they could c l e a r l y  perce ive  t h e  same d i s t i n c t i o n s  i n  the r u l e  
vers ions  +is were made i n  t h e  n a t u r a l  versfons. Thus w e  es tab l i shed  two 
c r i t e r i a  of evaluat ion:  na tura lneSs  of i n t o n a t i o n ,  and " i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y "  
of i n tona t ion ,  by which w e  mean a human l i s t e n e r  can c o r r e c t l y  perce ive  
which reading of a mult iple-reading sentence  as intended. 
A. Format of t h e  T e s t  
I n  o rder  t o  ob t a in  a q u a n t i t a t i v e  eva lua t ion  of the system, we 
devised the fol lowing four part tes t ,  which was presented t o  17 s u b j e c t s .  
The sentences  i n  the  test cons i s t ed  of 35 ve r s ions  made from a dozen sets 
of T 2 C  a n a l y s i s  parameters by imposing va r ious  n a t u r a l ,  manual, monotone, 
and rule-generated p i t c h  contours  on them. I n  t he  f i r s t  p a r t  listeners 
were asked t o  r a t e  readings  of 34 sentences  on a s c a l e  from 1 t o  5,  where 
I1 tr 
"1" meant the i n tona t ion  sounded mechanical o r  monotone, and 5 meant 
the i n t ~ n a t i o n  sounded n a t u r a l .  I n  t h e  secorid p a r t ,  l i s t e n e t s  were 
presented with 24 sentence  pairs and asked t o  indicate whether the first

f u s i o n  mat r ices .  (Figure 20.) Each one d e a l s  w i th  readiilgs of a s i n g l e

C. Transmission Problems 
Some of the sen tences  were n o t  w e l l  t r ansmi t ted  by the above 
d e f i n i t i o n .  A cons ide ra t i on  of t h e s e  i n d i c a t e s  t h e  kinds of problems 
that arose. For example, since the f i r s t  word of any normal d e c l a r a t i v e  
sen tence  r ece ives  some extra s t r e s s ,  t R e  listeners had difficulty d i s -  
t i ngu i sh ing  "John drove t o  t h e  s to re"  from "John drove t o  the store. r i

Figure 20. Confusion matrices for part 3 
rule version6 were clearly distinguishable (one with falling and one 
with riaing terminal intonation),  the listeners made many i n c o r r e c t  
choices. This may have bean due t o  e i t h e r  of the following two f a c t o r s :  
(1) As with the other sentences, a l l  t h e  rule vers ions  were based 
on a single s e t  of ana lys i s  parameters,  and dura t ion  was held constant .  
In  this sentence,  dura t ion  plays a g r e a t e r  ro l e  than i n  o the r s ,  and t h i s  
may have influenced judgment. 
(2) There may have been some c ~ n f u s i o n  about what the vers ions  meant, 
and there may have been confusion wi th  ie poss ib le  third reading i n  
which "Johnt1 and " ~ a r y "  a r e  stressed and y e t  the in tona t ion  i s  r i s i n g  
a t  the end. 
Dm Termination Problems 
Another problem mentioned by s e v e r a l  sub jec t s  wzs t h a t  the 
i n tona t ion  on some version8 ( r u l e  and hahd versions only) was n a t u r a l  up 
until t h e  very end of the sentence. Re have determined t h a t  this i s  a 
problem i n  shap ing+the  contour from t h e  l a s t  nuclear syllable t o  t h e  
f i n a l  p i t c h  of the  sentence,  ass igning  an appropr i a t e  fYna1 p i t c h ,  and 
determining the i n t e r a c t i o n  between the pi tch  of  the l a s t  nuclear  s y l l a b l e  
and the sentence f i n a l  pitch.  Further research-is needed i n  thls a rea .  
C. Discussion 
This paper is the r e p o r t  of an attempt to genera teep i t ch  
contours i n  speech s3~1tbes3.s using Junct ion Grammar as a t h e o r e t i c a l  
base. Since the  var ious  readings  of each sentence were ma& by imposing 
different pi tch contours on the same analysis parameters without changing 
durations, some versions were less than natural. However, this was t o  
be expected and we feel that it was even desirable in that it pointed 
out some specific cases in which durationedjustments are necessary. 
The evaluation a lso  pointed out t he  need f o r  f u r t h e r  research on the 
shaping of the  contour from t h e  las t  V 3  t o  the efid of the  sentence. We 
also realize the  need t o  incorporate  some refinements i n t o  the system 
i n  order t o  
(1) make degrees of adjustment f o r  fr icatives and s t o p s ,  
(2) improve the naturalness  of the  contours between nuclear  s y l l a b l e s ,  
(3) make adjustments for the  inherent pitch of $owel$ (Flanagan 
and Landgraf , 1968) . 
Based on the results of the evaluat ion t e s t ,  w e  f e e l  i t  i s  
appropriate to continue use of the Junction Grammar framework and t o  
attempt t o  develop a word concatenation vers ion  w i t h  durat ion,  pause and 
in tens i t ?  ca lcu la t ions ,  t o  attempt better shaping of the contour a f t e r  
the l a s t  nudlear syllable, and t o  examine many more sentence types in 
order t o  f u r t h e r  t e s t  the  adequacy of t h i s  framework f o r  dealing with 
t he  problem of generating prosodic con t ro l  parameters i n  speech synthes is .

hear the  f i r s t  l is t  wi th  a $ second pause after each sentence.  Just 
l i s t e n  and don' t  write anything. Then 10 secqnds l a t e r ,  you w i l l  hear 
the  second l i s t  with a 3 second pause after each sentence. This time, 
during the  pauses, r a t e  each sentence by w r i t i n g  down a number a f t e r ,  
it, The rating s c a l e  i s  1 t o  5. Remember t h a t  the evaluat ion c r i t e r i o n  
i s  in tona t ion  only. 
So please do no9t l e t  your judgements be in? qugqced by crackles  o r  pops 
- 
o r  h i s se s .  
A rating a? 1 means t h e  in tona t ion  sounded mechanical o r  unnatural, for 
example, monotone or  the way computers talk i n  cartoons. A ra t ing  of 
5 means the intonazion sounded natural, t h a t  is,  you can imagine the 
sentence was produced by a human speaker speaking ca re fu l ly .  Please 
t r y  t o  dis'tribute your scores  over the e n t i r e  range from 1 t o  5 .  
Before you beg in ,  p lease  read over the entire test t o  become

MacNeflage has  pointed up t h e  d i f f i c u l t y  of media t ing  between abstract

dynamic speech chain,  suggest ing t h a t  u n i t a r y  phonological represerrtations 
are analogous t o  a sequence of eggs conveyed t o  t h e  wringer of a washing

Given t h a t  t h e r e  is a d i s c r e t e  l i n g u i s t i c  i npu t  to the

Lieberman l ikewise  no tes  a r e l a t i v e  neg lec t  of t h e  phonet ic  l e v e l  of

such a theory should be s t ruc tu red  i n  terms of the aaa tomfz ,  physiologic,

Onn, similarly motivated by the no t ion  that speech .ought t o  be 
described in the context  of the organic mechanisms responsible f o r  it, 
supgests, tha t :  
It may, be argued that  an abstract represen ta t ion  may be 
regarded as i n s t r u c t i o n s  for p a r t i c u l a r  types of behavior 
of the kpeech-generating mechanism. When these  i n s t r u c t i o n s  
are carried out, the  var ious  reactions occurring between

synthes is  a t  BYU which at tempts  t o  s a t i s f y  the c r i t e r i a  suggested by 
ITacNeilage, Lieberman, and Onn r e f  e remed  above. The d e s c r i p t i v e  system 
i n  question i s  based on t h e  Junct ion Gramar Model of language developed by 
myself and my colleagues over the past e i g h t  years.5 It is a model 
specifically s t ruc tured  i n  terms of speech-related organs, e i t h e r  a s  they 
are known oi hypothesized, 
An Overview of the  Junct ion Grammar Model 
A fundamental t ene t  of junct ion theory i s  t h a t  l i n g u i s t i c  desc r ip t ion  
must involve not  s h p l y  m u l t i p l e  stages of der iva t ion ,  but mul t ip le  types 
of data and da ta  processing required  t o  simulate t h e  funct ions  of d i f f e r e n t  
body organs. (See Figure 1.) Thus, t h e  semantic components of t he  grammar 
a r e  designed t o  gsocess data structured f o r  specific semantic tracts, a s  i t  
were; the a r t i c u l a t o r y  component i s  designed t o  process data s t ruc tu red  for 
the vocal t r a c t ,  t h e  audio component i s  designed t o  process d a t a  s t fuc tured  
f o r  the auditory t r a c t ,  and s o  on. Of course,  such a model r equ i r e s  d i s t i n c t  
rule systems and procedures to opera te  on t h e d i f f e r e n t  data types i n  the 
various tracts. 
Figure 3. .  
A fur ther  tenet  of junction theory i s  t h a t  data types may not  be 
intermingled. To dq so  would, f o t  example, be tantamount to feeding 
ins t ruc t ions  f o r  both the hear t  4nd diaphragm t o  the diaphragm. Of 
course, semantic ins t ruc t ions  could not be executed by a vocal t r a c t ,  
nor could a r t i cu la to ry  ins t ruc t ions  be executed by a semantic t r a c t .  This 
means, i n  eff eot ,  t h a t  a "deep s t ~ u c t u r e "  i s  not transfdrmed ( i n  the usual 
sense of the word) into a surface q t ructure ,  b u t  ra ther  t h a t  semantic data  
must be used t o  s t imulate  a r t i cu l a to ry  i n s t ruc t ions ,  orthogrziphic ins t ruc t ions ,  
motor ins t ruct ions  required t o  produce ges tures ,  t o  make one blush, e t c .  
Thus, i n  JG semantic representat ions the re  a r e  no l ex i ca l  items, s ince  
these are considered t o  be arqicula tory  inS$xuctions. Similarly,  there  
i s  no semantic inf ormdtion i n  phonological repyesentations,  s ince  these a r e  
a d i f f e r en t  data type. The various d a t a  types a r e  considered t o  be symbol- 
i za t ions  of each other ,  not t r a n s T d m  or der ivat ions  of each other.  Data 
stimulation between the various t r a c t s  o r  components of the system i s  
accomplished by context s ens i t i ve  coding/decoding procedures, which are 
intended t o  simulate the neural in te r faces  which coordinate the function 
bf body organs involved i n  speech production. 
Jupction Grammar takes its name from Junct ion Rules (J-rules) ,  (See 
Figure 2.) J-rules s t ruc ture  data  t o  be processed by the  various components 
of t he  grammar. The e s sen t i a l  ingredients  of ev2ry.J-rule are two o r  more 
operands, an operation specifying hdw the operands a re  t u  be joined, and 
a labelling operation which assigns a category t o  the  operands taken as 
a un i t .  Thus, i n  junction grammar not  only do r u l e s  f o r  con-Junction require  
an operation symbol (visa the phrase structure r u l e  S+S & S).but  a l l  J l u l e s ,

is executed by a semantic processor, r e s u l t i n g  i n  addi t ions  t o  o r  changes

Junction trees occur in both semantic and a r t i c u l a t o r y  data. However, 
the qpexands and operations are of a t o t a l l y  different nature from type to 
type, since i n  t h e  semantic component they c o n s t i t u t e  complexes of i n s t r u c t i o n s

The operands of semantic trees a r e  sememes, i.e. u n i t s  which define loca t ions  
and s t a t e s  i n  the  information net;  tEe operands of a r t i c u l a t i o n  trees are 
ar t iculemes,  i.e. u n i t s  which r e l a t e  t o  loca t ions  and s t a t e s  of the  vocal  tract.

based.on - and, -' or and - but are formed via conjunct ion.  I n  A-trees, con- 
junct jon y i e ld s  evenly spaced non-overlapping u n i t s  having t h e  same degree

Now, i n  the context  of this rather general in t roduc t ion  t o  t h e  sub jec t ,  
l e t  us consider dynamic phonological r ep re sen ta t i ons  corresponding t o  the 
a r t f eu l a to ry  s t r u c t u r e  of s y l l a b l e s ,  words, and phrases. 
The S y l l a b l k  
The i p t a i t i v e  articttllatory u n i t  of which words consist i s  the s y l l a b l e ,  
which i s  i n  turn com;posed of phonemes. Generally speaking, sy l lables  have 
as t h e i r  nuclear component a coatinuous phoneme wl th  voca l i c  p rope r t i e s .  
This  nuclear phoneme may be del imi ted  both initially and f i n a l l y  by a 
phoneme having consonantal  p rope r t i e s .  Eence, w e  observe s y l l a b l e s  of the 
fol lowtng s t r i n g  types: 
D = de l imi t e r ;  W =,rhucleus; 0 i s  n u l l  
DWD

I f ,  however, we invoke the  concept of a n u l l  de l imi t e r  $, then these  four  
s y l l a b l e  p a t t e r n s  can be  reduced t o  a s i n g l e  type, DWD, where D may be 
e i t h e r  n u l l  or  non-null. The use of t h e  n u l l  de l imi t e r  $ is a c t u a l l y  more 
than a s impl i fy ing  assumption, since i n  many cases non-null segmentals 
r ep l ace  $ i n  the a r t i c u l a t i o n  stream e i t h e r  as f u l l  geminates o r  p a r t i a l s  
of neighboring de l imi t e r s .  
Ar t i cu l a to ry  Adiunction 
A s  noted above, junction theory attributes to adjunction those kernel 
configurations upon which all else i s  b u i l t  up. Since s y l l a b l e s  are t h e  
i n t u i t i v e  u n i t s  from Qhich words  and phrases are formed, w e  a t t r i b u t e  them 
t o  adjunction. 
There are two basic s y l l a b l e  types,  corresponding t o  whether t h e  
sy1labi.c nucleus is joined to the  initial o r  f f n a l  d e l i m i t e r ,  The two 
cases a r e  illustrated i n  Figure  6. 
NUCLEAR-INITIAL SYLLABLE MUCLEAR-FINAL SYLLABLE 
Figure 6. Two b a s i c  s y l l a b l e  types.  
Recent research provides useful criteria f o r  deciding when t o  ~ ' e e  each 
type. Bell-Berti and Harris report that :  
The effects of the terminal  consonant on the midpoint of the  
s t r e s s e d  vowel are not as l a r g e  as those  of t h e  i n i t i a l  con- 
sonant. In other wordb,  the  carryover  effect of t h e  first 
consonant on t h e  s t r e ~ s e d  vowel i s  larger than t h e  a n t i c i p a t o r y  
effect on t h e  second. 
For the  purposes of t h i s  d i scuss ion ,  l e t  u s  assume that stressed 
s y l l a b l e s  and s y l l a b l e s  wi th  s t r o n g  vowels are n u c l e a r - i n i q i a l  and t h a t  
o t h e r  s y l l a b l e s  a r e  nuclear - f ina l .  It i s  p o s s i b l e ,  of course,  t o  formulate 
junc t ion  r u l e s  which are not binary,  so  t h a t  a t h i r d  syllable type whose 
nucleus was equal ly  joined t o  both i n i t i a l  ahd f i n a l  d e l i m i t e r s  could be 
used, We avoid  this foumal complication,  however, until forced t o  i n t r o -  
duce i t  by empirical cons idera t ions .  
Notice t h a t  the use of structure t o  r e p r e s e n t  s y l l a b l e s  makes i t  
unnecessary t o  u se  a f e a t u r e  such as [+syllabic]. In comparing the use of 
this f e a t u r e  t o  that of the s t r u c t u r a l  n o t a t i o n  proposed,  w e  n o t e  t h a t  each 
appears t o  make d i s t i n c t  claims about t h e  n o t i o n  s y l l a b l e .  S p e c i f i c a l l y ,  t he  
feature asserts t h a t  a vowel i s  syllabic, - whereas the tree claims that 
s p k c i f i c  sequences of segmentals c o n s t i t u t e  s y l l a b l e s  whose nuclear element 
is  a p a r t i c u l a r  segment. 
Node Labels 
Turning now t o  the matter of node labels, w e  observe t h a t  ih p r a c t i r e  
it is des irable  to further subcategorize D and W in terms of more s p e c i f i c  
a r t i c u l a t i o n  c l a s s e s .  We the re fo re  define D t o  i n c l u d e  obstruent consonants 
(C) , l iquids (L) , g l i d e s  (G) , and n u l l  ) For W ,  vowels (V) and l iquids (L) 
are indica ted ,  and perhape i n  some cases even continuant obs t ruen ts ,  assuming 
tha t  expressions such  as vocat ive  "pssst" are t o  be analyzed as sy l lables  
also. We note parenthetically that g l i d e s  (G) are suspect ,  since they appear 
t o  be func t iona l  v a r i a n t s  of vowels, i,e, vowels funct ioning de l imi t ive ly .  
This, however, i s  not a problem, s i n c e  the use of J-rules t o  represen t  
a r t i c u l a t o r y  structures makes i t  just a s  f e a s i b l e  t o  consonantal ize a vowel 
by r u l e  as  i t  i s  $n t he  semantic component t o  nominalize a verb by qule. 
In short ,  the ae of junct ion trees t o  represent  a r t i c u l a t o r y  s t r u c t u r e  
b r ings  a g r e a t  deal  of d e s c r i p t i v e  power t o  bear ,  should we need i t .  
Thus w e  supplant  D and W wi th  more d e s c r i p t i v e l y  s p e d f i c  node l a b e l s  
and (append t o  them some element of t h e i r  r e spec t ive  vocabular ies  as terminal  
u n i t s ,  as i l l u s t r a t e d  by Figure 7 .  
Figure 7 .  
The s i g n i f i c a n c e  of V 2  and V3 as non-terminal labels i s  t h a t  of 
semi-syllable and syllable, respec t ive ly .  Bear i n  mind t h a t  the  opera t ion  
symbols appearing between operands a r e  r ep re sen ta t i ve  of t h e  ar tcculatorv 
junct ions ( t r a n s i t i o n s )  between them. Hence non-terminal nodes symbolize 
a r t i c u l a t o r y  sequences cons i s t ing  of t he  phonemes they dominate plus the  
transitions necessary to account for continuous movement from one di s t inc t ive  
vocal tract state to the next. This s i g n i f i e s ,  in effect, that glven a 
junction instruction of the form X O Y = 2, there exists a transi t ion 
T = O ( X , ~ ) ,  such that XW is a continuous articulatory sequence Z con- 
s i s t i n g  of the d i s t inct ive  units  X and Y mediated by transi t ional  T. This 
aspect of the fornulation is advanced as an at tem~ t to  satisfy the need for 
phonological notation p o t e n t i a l l y  capable of explicating both the discrete 
segmental elements of which the speech chain i s  composed, and the co- 
articulatory transitions which connect them i n  l i v e  speech. The practical  
effect of the foxmulation is that one's attention is drawn not t o  a yelatively 
limited set  of radical phonological changes, but t o  the co-articulatory 
effect of every junction on its operands, regardless of its subt lety .  This 
is important :f high quality synthetic speech is to be achievkd. 
Delimiting Clusters 
I -
Both i n i t i a l  and final syllable delimiters frequently cons i s t  of 
c lus ters  of segments rather than discrete segments. An analys is  of such 
clusters shows that notable assimilative forces are involved. We view 
this as a form of articulatory subordination, and, consequently, use 
subjunction as the basic junction type f o r  treating such clusters. The 
fact that a r t i c u l a ~ i o n  trees are capable of showing a variety of compositional 
arrangements makes it possible to give whatever internal structure for  
such c lus ters  as seems t o  be operative. Thus for  strand, where tr seem t o  
.- 
be more c lose ly  associated than st this can be e x p l i c i t l y  represented.

Multi-syllable Words 
Let us now consider how m u l t i - s y l l a b l e  words may be given in the form 
of a r t i c u l a t i o n  trees. The procedure,  briefly, is  a s  follows, using 
B a m b i  and Donna as the words  to be diagrammed: 
(1) The s y l l a b l e s  are identified. M I - B I  [baem - bi] 
DON-NA [da . - n a ]  
(2) The syllables are diagrammed using the a p p r o p r i a t e  adjunction type. 
(3) An interjunction is  constructed using syllable-f inal  and sy l lab le -  
i n i t i a l  const i tuents ,  (The label node i s  given as C s ince  b - seems 
t o  exert assimilative force over m.) - 
( 4 )  The label  node of the sub juxlction attaches t o  the  more heavily- 
stressed sy l l ab l e .  
(5) The in* t ia l  de l imi ter  of the  more weakly-stressed s y l l a b l e  becomes the  
intersect  node.

S imi la r ly ,  i t  fol lows t h a t  i f  t r e e s  are  an appropriate medium f o r

While the  proposed system is  s t i l l  i n  i ts  infancy,  so  t o  speak, some

and provocative consequence of the research to date.
