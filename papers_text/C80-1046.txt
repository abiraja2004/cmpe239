The development of the theory of 
library classification and of subject 
indexing, for the organisation, storage 
and retrieval of subjects embodied in 
documents has a striking parallelism to 
the search for 'universal forms' and 
deep structure'ln language and linguis- 
tic studies. The significant contri- 
butions of  the theories of  classifi- 
cation and subject indexing are the 
subject analysis techniques of Ranga- 
nathan and Bhattacharyya's POPSI. A 
computer based system, for generating 
an information retrieval thesaurus, 
from modulated subject-proposltlons, 
formulated according to the subject 
analysis techniques, enriched with 
certain codes for relating the terms 
in the subject-proposltlons has been 
developed. The system generates hier- 
archlc, associative, coordinate and 
synonymous relationships between terms 
and presents them as an alphabetical 
thesaurus. Also, once a thesaurus is 
generated in one language it is possi- 
ble to produce the same thesaurus in 
different languages by Just forming a 
table of equivalent terms in the 
required language. 
Inform~tlon Retrle v@l Th@s,eurus 
An information retrieval thesau- 
rus could be defined as "a controlled 
dynamic vocabulary of semantically 
related terms offering comprehensive 
coverage of a domain of knowledge". 
Its main use is in the subject cha- 
racterization of documents end queries 
in information storage and retrieval 
systems^based on concept coordi- 
nation ~o. 
The application of computers for 
updating, testing, editing and print- 
ing thesaurus 25 has gained much 
importance due to the use of thesaurus 
as a vocabulary control device in bib- 
liographic information storage and 
retrieval systems, at the input stage 
for controlled indexing and at the 
retrieval stage for expanding the 
f ~,f search query to increase recall - 
both in batch and on-line modes of 
processing 18, 22, 62, 64. 
Automatic Generation of Thescurus 
Several experiments in automatic 
generation of thesaurus have been 
carried out in which relationships 
between terms have been determined by 
taking into account the number of docu- 
ments in which therespectlve terms 
occur Jointly 27, 65. Various cluster- 
ing techniques have been investigated 
out of a range of similarity criteria. 
The role played by similarity criteria 
in obtaining the environment of each 
term and the use of this environment 
for retrieval have been explored 57. 
Computational procedures for genera- 
ting thesaurus include keyword statis- 
tics, calculation of Tanlmoto coeffi- 
cient 61, matrix inversion, formation 
of similarity matrix, automatic cluster 
analysis using minimal tree procedure 
and compilation of groups2~nd ~aln6,~__ 
groups of descriptors i, ~, ~ , ~ , 
58, 65, 66. 
But, "the difficulty, however, 
is that text-scannlng is more effective 
in syntactic and morphological analysis 
where there is sufficient repetition 
to justify the belief that a particular 
fact is significant" 31, 32. Further, 
all these techniques use a lot of 
computer time and are capable of pro- 
duclng a list of selected and grouped 
keywords. But it has also been 
observed that, although a large variety 
of clusters and assoclsted query 
expansions have been obtained, no slg- 
niflcant improvements in the document 
retrieval3~erformance have bean 
achieved ~. In other words, an infor- 
mation retrieval thesaurus is something 
morekeywordsthan4~.llst of grouped and ranked 
BAsic Aspects of Thesaurus 
There are two basic aspects of 
thesaurus construction. They are: 
I selection of keywords/descriptors 
of the subject for which the 
thesaurus is constructed; and 
303-- 
2 establishment of interrelation- 
ships among these selected key- 
words as to whether the terms form 
a broader or narrower or related 
or synonymous or 'use' relation. 
Using computers alone for both the 
above mentioned aspects of thesaurus 
construction is not practicable for, 
using computers for selecting the key- 
words from free language text is not an 
economic approach, and it is not feasi- 
ble to make a computer automatically 
distinguish the relationship between 
terms as to broader, narrower, 
synonymous etc. 
Metalanguage for Information Or~anl- 
sation 
It was realised that the failure 
of experiments with automatic abstract- 
ing, indexing etc., "should be sought 
above all, in an insufficient knowledge 
of the structure of the text from the 
standpoint of relationships between an 
apparent formal linguistic representa- 
tion on bne hand and on the other hand, 
the informational content involved in 
the text ... As the result of such 
investigations we Can arrive, among 
others, at various descriptive formulas 
of the structure of scientific texts "28. 
One way of arriving at structures that 
reflect specific textual content is to 
make use of the restrictions in langua- 
ge usage which are characteristic of 
the texts in a particular subject matter 
that is, to exploit the fact that on a 
particular topic, only certain words in 
certain combinations actually appear 55. 
In other words, it was realised that 
what is required is a special purpose 
artificial language, to cater to the 
needs of information storage, process- 
ing and retrieval. The Automatic Lan- 
g uage Processing Advisory Committee 1966) reallsed and reported that "A 
deeper knowledge of language could 
help ... to enable us to engineer arti- 
ficial languages for special purposes... 
and to use machines as aids in trans- 
lation and in information retrieval"40. 
Subsequently, suggestions for a 
metatheory of linguistics and informa- 
tion science, with a metalauguage hav- 
ing all the properties of a c lass i f i -  
cation schema have been proposed. The 
term 'metalanguage' specifies a 
'public' metalanguage, such as a docu- 
ment classification system, as distin- 
guished from the 'object language' re- 
presented by the documents. The 
written record of a document classifi- 
cation schema is not really parallel to 
the surface structure of the object 
language - the natural language senten- 
ces of a document. A classification 
schema is intended to classify, and, 
therefore the language of the schema is 
mainly classificatory. In other words, 
the metalanguage does not explicitly 
include all relevant terms in the object 
language, but the object language does 
include all terms in the metalanguage. 
Moreover, superset-subset (class inclu- 
sion) relations are usually explicitly 
given by~he structure of the classifi- 
cation jo. Thus some of the'logical 
semantic' relatigns , specifically those 
of implication 4D are specified in the 
so-called 'surface structure~of the 
metalanguage, but not in the surface 
structure of the object language 38. 
Universal Forms and Subject Represen- 
tatlon 
Parallel to the search for univer- 
sal linguistic forms such as that ex- 
p ounded by Chomsky, Fodor and others the discovery that certain features of 
given languages can be reduced to uni- 
versal properties of language and ex- 
plained in terms of deeper aspects of 
linguistic form, 11, 12, 37; and that 
such deep structure of sentences deter- 
mine the semantic content while their 
surface structures determine the phone- 
tic interpretation), steps towards the 
formulation of generic framework for 
structuring the representation of the 
name of a subject for the development 
of classification schemes and subject21 
~ndexln~ languages were investigated , 
3, 45-~8. Such universals are Being 
arrived at and used in various other 
areas dealing with information and 
information processing. For instance, 
in the area of data modelling, now the 
basic problem is to identify the world 
as a domain of objects with properties 
and relations 10. 
Such categorlsation of objects of 
study is not new to the library profe- 
ssion. As early as 1930s, the use of 
categorlsation of component ideas form- 
ing the name of a subject into Person- 
ality/core object of study, Matter/ 
property/method, Energy/acti~1, Space/ 
place and Time, and defining an order 
of these categories to form a 'logical, 
classificatory language' resulting in 
'faceted' library classification sche- 
mes was known in India 45, 47. 
It is interesting to note that it 
has been realised now that the above 
mentioned Ranganathan's categories 
Personality, Matter and Energy, are 
"general categories building the 
system's etructure as a spatlotemporal 
304 
neighbourhood relationship " useful in 
deriving meta informational, for a pro- 
cess of automatic analysis too 13, 14. 
The order of the component ideas 
denoting the different categories in 
the name of a subject as prescribed is 
context-dependent order. More specifi- 
cally it is context-specifying order. 
Every component category sets the con- 
text for the next and following ones. 
Also in this classificatory language, 
every category should explicitly have 
the corresponding superordinate compo- 
nent ideas preceding it. The reason 
for fixing the superordinates before 
thecomponent elements concerned is to 
render the component elements denote 
precisely the ideas they represent. 
Further, it has been conjectured 
that 46, 52 the syntax (order) of re- 
presentation of the component elements 
in the name of a subject as prescribed 
by the pr$~ciples for sequence - facet 
sequence 4w - is more or less parallel 
to the Absolute Syntax - ie., the se- 
quence in which the component ideas of 
subjects falling in a subject-fleld 
arrange themselves in the minds of a 
majority of normal intellectuals. If 
the syntax of the representation of the 
component ideas of subjects is made to 
conform to, or parallel to the Absolute 
Syntax, then the pattern of linking of 
the component ideas - ie., the result- 
ing kngwledge structure is likely 
to be ~ 
I More helpful in organising subjects 
in a logical sequence for efficient 
storage and retrieval; 
2 Free from the aberrations due to 
variations in linguistic syntax 
from the use of the verbal plane in 
naming subjects; and 
3 Helpful in probing deeper into the 
pattern of human thinking and modes 
of ~ombination of  ideas. 
Subject In~exin ~ ~nd ThesAurus 
Due to the development of techni- 
ques for structuring of subjects and 
for classification of subjects, several 
experiments were conducted at the Docu- 
mentation Research and Training Centre 
to use them for thesaurus construction. 
To begin with, a faceted library cla- 
ssification scheme for a specific sub- 
ject field was used in t~ computer-- 
generation of thesaurus -~ in which it 
was possible to incorporate the hier- 
archic relationships of terms. But it 
was not possible to incorporate the 
generation of non-hierarchic associ- 
ative relationship of terms. 
Terms that have associative rela- 
tionship to each other have to be esta- 
bllshed only by consensus of experts in 
the field concerned. But the validity 
of the assumption that, knowledge based 
on the consensus of experts in a field 
is different from the knowledge expre- 
ssed in the literature of the field has 
been challenged, as the two lists of 
keywords, one given by experts and the 
other formed by analysis of published 
literature were not significantly 
different 33. In other words, terms 
that are related to each other assocl- 
atively could be easily ascertained by 
an analysis of the statement of the 
name of the subject of a document or of 
a reader's query. For instance, whe- 
ther "x-ray treatment" is associatlvely 
related to "cancer", or not, could be 
established if there exists a document 
on "x-ray treatment of cancer". In  
other words, a published document on 
"x-ray treatment of cancer" brings into 
associative relationship both "x-ray 
treatment" and "cancer". Also it is 
unimportant which terms co-occur fre- 
quently in the names of subjects for, 
any term that is used once in the 
statement of the name of a subject is 
enough to be admitted into the thesau- 
rus for that subject and is related 
with other terms in that name of the 
subject in some particular way. In 
order to incorporate associatively re- 
lated terms in thesauri, experiments 
were conducted 35, 53 using subject 
representations formulated for the 
purpose of developing classification 
schedules, which were arrived at bY 
Ranganathan's facet analysis 21, 49 for 
thesaurus construction. With certain 
limitations it was possible to generate 
broader, narrower and associative re- 
lationships but not coordinate rela- 
tionships. Further, it was realised 
that 2, 17 selection of candidate terms 
and ascertaining of multiple linkage of 
relationships among terms can be done 
in several ways such as by 
1 the analysis of user's query 
specifications ; 
2 the analysis of summarised state- 
ments of the subjects of documents; 
and 
3 the analysis of sentences in the 
text of dictionary, glossary, en- 
cyclopaedia and even text books 
and treatises. 
Artificlal Lan~u~e for Thesaurus 
Further research into the funda- 
mentals of subject indexing languages 
resulting in the development of a 
305- 
general4theory of subject indexing lan- 
guages and the development of the 
Postulate-based Permuted Subject Index- 
ing (POPSI) language 3, 8 has provided 
a basis for a more efficient and flexi- 
ble system for thesaurus construction. 
According to the general theory of 
subject indexing languages; information 
is the message conveyed or intended to 
be conveyed by a systemetlsed body of 
ideas, or its accepted or acceptable 
substitutes. Information in general, 
is of two types: discursive information 
and non-dlscursive information or unit 
facts. Non-discursive information or 
unit facts may be6either qualitative or 
quantitative P, I . The name of a sub- 
Ject is essentially a piece of non-dls- 
cursive information end it is conveyed 
by an indicative formulation that summa- 
rises in its message, 'what a particu- 
lar body of information is about'. "The 
language for indicating what a body of 
information is about, need not necessa- 
rily be in terms of sentences of the 
natural language. It can be an artifi- 
cial language of indicative formulation 
used to indicate whet a body of infor- 
mation is about" o. 
The essential ingredients of a 
language - natural or artificial - ere 
the elementary constituents; and rules 
for the formulation of admissible ex- 
pressions using the elementary consti- 
tuents. A Subject Indexing Language 
consists of elementary constituents and 
rules for the formulation of admissible 
subject-proposltlons. It is used to 
summarise in indicative formulations 
what the contents of a source of infor- 
mation are about. The purpose of these 
summarlslng indicative formulations is 
to create groups of sources of informa- 
tion to facilitate expeditious retrieval 
of information about them by providing 
necessary and sufficient access points. 
The component ideas in the name 
of a subject can be deemed to fall in 
any one of the elementary categories: 
Discipline, Entity, Action and Property. 
The term 'manifestation' is used to 
denote an idea or a term denoting an 
idea, falling in any one of the elemen- 
tary categories. Apart from the ele- 
mentary categories there are Modifiers 
to the elementary categories. A modi- 
fier refers to an idea or a term deno- 
ting an idea, used or intended to be 
used to qualify the manifestation with- 
out disturbing the conceptual wholeness 
of the latter. A modifier can modify a 
manifestation of any one of the elemen- 
tary categories, as well as a combina- 
tion of two or more manifestations of 
two or more elementary categories. 
Modifiers can be common modifiers like 
time, place etc. or special modifiers 
which can be entity based or action 
based or property based. Apart from the 
elementary categories and modifiers 
there is a Base and Core. Due to the 
fact that recent research work is gene- 
rally project-orlented, mlsslon-orlent- 
ed and inter-dlsclpllnary and not gene- 
rally disclpllne-orlented, there may be 
a need to bring together all or major 
portion of information pertaining toa  
manifestation or manifestations of a 
particular elementary category. This 
manifestation or elementary category is 
the Base. Similarly, need may arise to 
bring together within a recognised Base, 
all or major portion of information per- 
taining to manifestations of one or 
more elementary categories, the cate- 
gory or categories concerned are the 
Core of the concerned Base. Also the 
elementary categories may admit of 
Species (genus-specles) and Parts (Whole 
-Part).

'Fne rules of syntax of POPSI pre- 
scribed for the subject-propositions is 
D followed by E (both modified or un- 
modified) appropriately interpolated or 
extrapolated wherever warranted, by A ? 
and/or P (both modified or un-modified). 
A manifestation of Action (A) follows 
immediately the manifestation in rela- 
tion to which it is an A. A manifes- 
tation of Property (P) follows immedi- 
ately the manifestations in relation to 
-306-- 
which it is a P. A Species (type)/Part 
follows immediately the manifestation 
in relation to which it is a Species/ 
Part. A Modifier follows immediately 
the manifestation in relation to which 
it is a modifier. Generally a modifier 
gives rise to a species. Also if nece- 
ssary auxiliary words within brackets 
could be inserted in between terms if 
found necessary? These form the basis 
of the POPSI language. 
While examining whether a classifi- 
cation scheme could form a 'metalangu- 
age' of a metatheory of linguistics and 
information science, it has been obser- 
ved that "all relational information 
necessary for the explication of an 
object language" are not present in 
classification schema, especially role 
notions and presuppositions 38. Such 
'relational modifiers' or 'role indica- 
tors', qS, 20, 63 that describe the 
role of the concept in context, repre- 
senting basic 'role notions' such as 
the cause of the event, the effect of 
the event etc., similar to that of the 
case relations - nominative, accusative, 
instrumental 19 etc. - if incorporated 
in the subject-propositions, fo~nulated 
according to the 'subject analysis' 
techniques mentioned above 3-8, 45-52, 
then it could form a 'metalanguage' for 
thesaurus, from which thesaurus could 
be generated automatically. 
,!Dput Subject-propositions for 
Thesaurus 
The preparation of input to the 
thesaurus construction system starts 
with writing out sentences such as, 
"this book is about ... , this report 
is about ...., this paper is about ..., 
this query is about ... " 23, 36. "To 
tell what is the subject or topis of a 
play, a picture, a story, a lecture, 
a book etc., forms part of the indivi- 
duals mastery of a natural language ... 
They are the starting point of most 
requesters when approaching a biblio- 
graphic information retrieval system or 
in a d ia lo~e with a librarian or docu- 
mentallst"-60. To aid in such an indi- 
cative formulation that summarlses in 
its message what a particular body of 
information is about, the title of the 
document or the raw specification of 
the readers' query or even sentence or 
sentences in the text of dictionary, 
glossary, abstract and even text-books 
is taken as the starting point. Each 
of the specific subjects dealt within 
the document or specified in the rea- 
der's query or text statements are 
determined and expressed in natural 
language. 
Let one of the names of subjects 
be expressed as "Re-tsnnlng of chrome 
tanned leather using chestnut". Each 
of the component ideas such as the name 
of the dlsclpllne (baser the core 
object of study (entity) etc., that are 
implied in the expressed statement of 
the subject are explicitly stated to 
form an 'expressive title' 48, 50, 51 
i ow . " as fo 1 s. In Leather Technology, re- 
tanning of chrome tanned leather by 
vegetable tanning using chestnut". 
The 'expressive title' is then 
analysed to identify the 'elementary 
categories' and 'modifiers' and the 
component terms are written down re- 
moving irrelevant auxiliaries, as a 
formallsed representation, following 
the principles of sequence of compo- 
nents 9, 49. The analysed and forma- 
lised subJect-proposltlon is given 
below: 
I Disclpllne) Leather Technology, Core Entity) Chrome Tanned Leather, Action on Entity) Re-tannlng , LB~7 Action based Modifler) VegetabIe- 
Tanning, /Using\] (Entity based Modi- 
fier) CheBtnut. 
The subject-proposltlon is then 
modulated by augmenting it by inter- 
polating and extrapolating as the case 
may be, by the successive superordlna- 
tes of each elementary category by 
finding out 'of which it is a species 
(type) or part'. The synonymous terms 
if any are attached to the correspond- 
ing standard terms. The modulated 
subject-proposition is given below: 
Leather Technology. Leather, Tanned 
Leather, Chrome-tanned Leather/. 
Chrome Leather. Re-tanning (by) 
Vegetable Tanning (Using) Chestnut. 
The auxiliary words (even if rele- 
vant are removed from the subject-pro- 
position and phrases enclosed within 
brackets indicating 'role notions' or 
'role indicators' are inserted between 
the kernel terms. The resulting sub- 
Ject-proposition is given below: 
Leather Technology. Leather (Type 
of-) Tanned Leather (type of-) 
Chrome Tsnned Leather/Chrome Leather. 
(process used-) Re-tannln~ (process 
used-~ Vegetable Tanning (agent 
used-) chestnut. 
The subject-proposltion is further 
analysed to determine which terms are 
associatively related to each other 
specifically. For instance, in the 
above subject-proposltlon 'chestnut' is 
related to 'Vegetable tanning' and also 
- 307-  
to 'Re-tanning', as an agent used in 
both the processes. 'Chrome tanned 
leather' is related to 'Re-tannlng' as 
it admits of being re-tanned, and also 
to 'Vegetable tanning' as it admits of 
being vegetable (re) tanned. After 
this analysis, the subject-proposition 
ks formulated as a relation map showing 
the 'links'. The relation map for the 
above subject-proposltlon is given in 
the figure below: 
'$3' -- Generate NT relation with the 
immediately succeeding term and genera- 
te a reverse BT relation. No role in- 
dicator code is used (whole - part 
relation). 
The codes for generating RT rela- 
tion and the associated computer mani- 
pulation are: '$1' -- Generate a RT 
relation with the immediately succeed- 
inn term using the role indicator code 
LEATHER TECHNOLOGY. LEATHER (type of-) TANNED 
In the relation map given above, 
the dotted lines indicate NT/BT rela- 
tionship, continuous lines indicate RT 
relationship and slash indicates 
synonym/use relatlonship. 
The relationship between pairs of 
terms NT or RT as indicated by dotted 
lines and continuous lines respectively 
as  shown in the example, are replaced 
by appropriate codes to form the input 
to the thesaurus generation system. 
The codes used in the subject- 
propositions for generating entries for 
a thesaurus are of the following types: 
1 those that indicate which terms are 
to be related (codes for relating 
terms) and whether the relation is 
NT or RT or SYN; and 
2 those that denote the role indi- 
cators. 
The codes for relating terms are 
of the following three types: 
1 those that indicate NT relation; 
2 those that indicate RT relation; 
and 
3 that which indicates Synonymous 
relation. 
The codes for generating NT rela- 
tion and the associated computer mani- 
pulation are: '$2' -- Generate a NT 
relation with the immediately succeed- 
ing term using the role indicator code 
of the term being manipulated and gene- 
rate a reverse BT relation changing the 
position of '-' in the role indicator 
code (genus-  species relation); and 
and generate a reverse RT relation 
changing the position of '-' in the 
role indicator code; and '$5, $6, $7, 
$8, and S0' -- Generate a RT relation 
with the immediately preceding term 
with the same '$ code' taking the role 
indicator code of the term being mani- 
pulated and generate a reverse RT rela- 
tion changing the position of '-' in 
the role indicator code. 
The code for generating Synonymous 
relation and the associated computer 
manipulation is: '/' -- Generate a 
Synonymous relation with the immediate- 
ly preceding term and generate a rever- 
se 'Use' relation. 
It is to be noted that the role 
indicators are used specifically for 
further categorlsatlon of RTs, as they 
are expected to be numerous. But 
representation of genus-specles rela- 
tions could also be categorlsed to 
achieve better display format and for 
proper generation of coordinate RTs 
out of NTs to a particular term. The 
following is an extract of role indi- 
cators used in our experimental 
thesaurus on Leather Technology: 
O1 - Source of; 
07 - Property of; 
08 - Process used; 
12 - Agent used; 
13 - Device used; 
16 - Type of; 
19 - Constituent of. 
The subject-propositlon drawn as 
a relation map is augmented with the 
308 
codes described above to reflect the 
different NT and RT links as given 
below: 
$0 LEATHER TECHNOLOGY $4 LEATHER 
$2 (16-) ST TANNED LEATHER $2 (16-) 
$6 $7 CHROME TANNED LEATHER / CHROME 
LEATHER $0 (08-) $9 (08-) $6 (08-) 
RE-TANNING $7 (O8-) $6 (08-) VEGE- 
TABLE TANNING $I (12-) ST (12-) 
CHESTNUT. 
? Computer Coding of Sub~ect-propositlons 
An assorted number of subject- 
propositions from a specific subject 
field, augmented with codes for relat- 
ing terms and codes for role indicators 
are read by a program 'CODEK'. Each 
of the unique terms in the subject-pro- 
positions is internally serial numbered 
uniquely and the respective terms in 
the subject-propositions are replaced 
by their serial numbers. As and when 
a term is encountered in a subject-pro- 
position, it is matched with existing 
terms and its seri8l n%/mber is picked 
if the term is available, if not the 
term is entered as the last entry with 
appropriate serial number and the given 
serial number is replaced in the sub- 
Ject-proposition. The term dictionary 
thus built, and the translated subject- 
propositions, are written separately 
as two different files for further pro- 
cessing. A sample of the dictionary is 
given below: 
0001 SKIN 
0002 BEND 
0003 BELLY 
0004 OFFAL 
0005 HALF BACK 
0006 SPLIT 
0007 FLESH SPLIT 
Manipulation of Sub~ect-prcposltions 
The coded subject-propositions 
are manipulated to generate term-palrs 
(terms denoted by serial numbers) 
following the links indicated by the 
codes. Once an entry is prepared its 
reverse entry is automatically generat- 
ed by changing the position of the 
'lead term' and the 'context term'. In 
hierarchic relationships the relation 
NT is changed to BT in reversing the 
entry. In RT entries the relation does 
not change in the reversal. In the 
case of entries having the role indi- 
cator codes, the position of '-' is 
changed from prefix to suffix and vice 
versa as appropriate. In the case of 
Synonymous relationship indicated by 
'/' in the input, a SYN and a reverse 
USE entries are generated. These 
processes are done by a program named 
'GENTHES'. The entries foe the thesau- 
rus at this stage are in the form of 
serial numbers standing for the 'lead' 
and the 'context' terms with the role 
indicator code in between them. The 
entries look as shown below: 
O009RT (O8-) 0435 
0433RT (-O8) OO09 
0010NT(16-)0011 
0011BT (-16)0010 
Generation of Coordinate Term-palrs 
The term-palrs so for generated 
are the hierarchic and non-hlerarchic 
associative types. Terms coordinate to 
a particular term are not present in 
them. In order to generate coordinate 
entries, the generated entries are 
sorted in ascending sequence so that, 
'context' serial numbers for the same 
'lead term' (having the same serial 
number in the lead term position and 
having the same role indicator code) 
that are NTs, are formed as a separate 
table and coordinate RT term-palrs are 
generated among them. These coordinate 
entries are merged with the earlier 
generated entries, and passed as a file 
for further processing. The generation 
of coordinate entries is done by a 
program named 'GENCORD'. 
Translation of Thesaurus Entrles 
The file of generated entries for 
thesaurus is retranslated back into 
natural language terms by a program 
named 'TKANSLAT'. The term dictionary 
created as a file by the program CODER 
is read together with role indicator 
codes and their corresponding descrip- 
tive phrases. The file of thesaurus 
entries, passed on by the program 
GENCORD, is read record by record. The 
serial number of both the 'lead' and 
'context' terms are translated into 
natural language terms using the term 
dictionary. The role indicator code is 
also translated into the corresponding 
descriptive phrase. The translated 
entries are written as a file for 
further sorting and printing. 
Translation to Different LanguaKe ~ 
In order to translate the gene- 
rated thesaurus into another language 
the term dictionary and the descriptive 
phrases denoting the role indicator 
codes are replaced by equivalent terms 
in the required language. Incompatibi- 
lity of terms though pose some problems 
it is possible to form these two files 
309 
easily 24 . But care must be taken to 
choose the correct standard terms and 
synonyms. The term dictionary if 
dumped out has an indication as to 
which terms are taken as synonyms, 
which must be taken care of in prepar- 
ing the 'translation table'. 
Sorting and Printing Thesaurus 
The file of thesaurus entries in 
natural language terms, output of the 
program 'TRANSLAT', is sorted alpha- 
betically using the SORT program avai- 
lable in the computer system. It is 
then printed out in double column 
format with proper indention for 'lead' 
term, relation, role indicator, and 
'context term'. 
Programs Developed for Thesauru s 
The programs developed for gene- 
rating thesaurus as outlined in this 
paper are written in COBOL end 
ASSEMBLER languages for IBM System/370 
series computers and require a 256K 
partition, two tape drives, one disk 
drive and a line printer. The programs 
have been used to generate a thesaurus 
of Leather Technology terms using test 
data of about 1500 subject-propositions. 
The number of unique terms were 1851 , 
the total number of entries were 13,717. 
The thesaurus generation work took 
about 3 months of input preparation by 
two persons and lOmln 26.73secs of CPU 
time at an IBM System/370-159. The 
programs were kept as load modules and 
were executed. 
Conclusion 
The study of linguistics in 
general, and the theories of universal 
grammar and structure of languages in 
particular, provide a frame-work for 
the development of scientific languages 
- artificial languages for specific 
purposes - relevant to applications in 
the different links in the'communica- 
tion chain' that links creators of 
information and users of the same. The 
development of the theory of Subject 
Indexing Languages and its applications 
in the field of information storage and 
retrieval is a clear indication of this 
development.
