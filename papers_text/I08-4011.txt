Abstract 
This paper describes a Chinese part-of-
speech tagging system based on the maxi-
mum entropy model. It presents a novel 
two-stage approach to using the part-of-
speech tags of the words on both sides of 
the current word in Chinese part-of-speech 
tagging. The system is evaluated on four 
corpora at the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff in 
the close track of the Chinese part-of-
speech tagging task. 
1 Introduction 
A part-of-speech tagger typically assigns a tag to 
each word in a sentence sequentially from left to 
right or in reverse order. When the words are 
tagged from left to right, the part-of-speech tags 
assigned to the previous words are available to the 
tagging of the current word, but not the tags of the 
following words. And when words are tagged from 
right to left, only the tags of the words on the right 
side are available to the tagging of the current 
word. We expect the use of the tags of the words 
on both sides of the current word should improve 
the tagging of the current word. In this paper, we 
present a novel two-stage approach to using the 
tags of the words on both sides of the current word 
in tagging the current word. We train two maxi-
mum entropy part-of-speech taggers on the same 
training data. The difference between the two tag-
gers is that the second tagger uses features involv-
ing the tags of the words on both sides of the cur-
rent word, while the first tagger uses the tags of 
only the previous words. Both taggers assign tags 
to words from left to right. In tagging a new sen-
tence, the first tagger is applied to the testing data, 
and then the second tagger is applied to the output 
of the first tagger to produce the final results.  
We participated in the Chinese part-of-speech 
tagging task at the Fourth International Chinese 
Language Processing Bakeoff. Our Chinese part-
of-speech taggers were trained only on the training 
data provided to the participants, and evaluated on 
four corpora in the close track of the part-of-speech 
tagging task. The words in both the training and 
testing data sets are already segmented into words. 
2 Maximum Entropy POS Tagger 
Maximum entropy model is a machine learning 
algorithm that has been applied to a range of natu-
ral language processing tasks, including part-of-
speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). Our Chinese 
part-of-speech taggers are based on the maximum 
entropy model.  
2.1 Maximum Entropy Model 
The conditional maximum entropy model (Berger, 
et. al., 1996) has the form

kkxZ ?= ?  
where ?= y xypxZ )|()( is a normalization fac-
tor, and k? is a weight parameter associated with 
feature ).,( yxfk  In the context of part-of-speech 
tagging, y is the POS tag assigned to a word, and x 
represents the contextual information regarding the 
word in consideration, such as the surrounding 
words. A feature is a real-valued, typically binary, 
function. For example, we may define a binary fea-
ture which takes the value 1 if the current word of 
X is ?story? and its POS tag is ?NNS?; and 0 other-
wise. Given a set of training examples, the log 
likelihood of the model with Gaussian prior (Chen 
and Rosenfeld, 1999) has the form

Malouf (2002) compared iterative procedures such 
as Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) and Im-
proved Iterative Scaling (IIS) with numerical opti-
mization techniques like limited-memory BFGS 
(L-BFGS) for estimating the maximum entropy 
model parameters and found that L-BFGS outper-
forms the other methods.  The use of L-BFGS re-
quires the computation of the gradient of the log 
likelihood function. The first derivative with re-
spect to parameter k?  is given by

where the first term kp fE~  is the feature expecta-
tion with the empirical model, and the second term 
kp fE is the feature expectation with respect to the 
model. In our model training, we used L-BFGS to 
estimate the model parameters by maximizing 
)(?L on the training data. 
 
2.2 Features 
The feature templates used in our part-of-speech 
taggers are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

Table 2: Additional feature templates used in the 
second stage POS tagger. 
 
The features are grouped into four categories. The 
first category contains features involving word to-
kens only; the second category consists of features 
involving tags only; the third category has features 
involving both word tokens and tags. And the last 
category has four special features. In the feature 
templates, wi denotes the current word, wi-2 the 
second word to the left, wi-1 the previous word, 
wi+1 the next word, wi+2 the second word to the 
right of the current word, and ti denotes the part-of-
speech tag assigned to the word wi. The FirstChar 
refers to the initial character of a word, and the 
LastChar the final character of a word. The Length 
denotes the length of a word in terms of byte. And 
the feature ForeignWord indicates whether or not a 
word is a foreign word. Table 2 shows additional 
feature templates involving the part-of-speech tags 
of the following one or two words. The features 
involving the tags of the words in the right con-
texts are used only in the second maximum entropy 
POS tagger. Features are generated from the train-
ing data according to the feature templates pre-
sented in Table 1 and Table 2. 
2.3 Training Models 
The four training corpora we received for the Chi-
nese part-of-speech tagging task include the Aca-
demia Sinica corpus (CKIP), the City University 
of Hong Kong corpus (CityU), the National Chi-
nese Corpus (NCC), and the Peking University 
corpus (PKU).  The CKIP corpus and the CityU 
corpus contain texts in traditional Chinese, while 
the NCC corpus and the PKU corpus contain texts 
in simplified Chinese. The texts in all four training 
corpora are segmented into words according to 
different word segmentation guidelines. And the 
words in all training corpora are labeled with part-
of-speech tags using different tag sets.  
Two maximum entropy POS taggers were 
trained on each of the four corpora using our own 
implementation of the maximum entropy model. 
The first-stage POS tagger was trained with only 
the feature templates presented in Table 1, while 
the second-stage POS tagger with the feature tem-
plates presented in both Table 1 and Table 2. 
All the first-stage POS taggers, one for each 
corpus, were trained with the same feature tem-
plates shown in Table 1, and all the second-stage 
POS taggers were trained with the same feature 
templates shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The fea-
ture templates are not necessarily optimal for each 
individual corpus. For simplicity, we chose to ap-
ply the same feature templates to all four corpora. 
83
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
The same parameter settings were applied in the 
training of all eight POS taggers. More specifi-
cally, no feature selection was performed. All fea-
tures, including features occurring just once in the 
training data, were retained. The sigma square 
2? was set to 5.0. And the training process was 
terminated when the ratio of the likelihood differ-
ence between the current iteration and the previous 
iteration over the likelihood of the current iteration 
is below the pre-defined threshold or the maximum 
number of iterations, which was set to 400, is 
reached. Both the first-stage POS tagger and the 
second-stage POS tagger were trained on the same 
corpus. 
2.4 Testing the Models 
The POS tagger assigns a part-of-speech tag to 
each word in a new sentence such that the tag se-
quence maximizes the probability p(Y|X), where X 
is the input sentence, and Y the POS tags assigned 
to X. The decoder implements the beam search 
procedure described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). At 
each word position, the decoder keeps the top n 
best tag sequences up to that position. The decoder 
also uses a word/tag dictionary, consisting of the 
words in the training data and the tags assigned to 
each word in the training data. During the decod-
ing phase, if a word in the new sentence is found in 
the training data, only the tags that are assigned to 
that word in the training corpus are considered. 
Otherwise, all the tags in the tag set are considered 
for a new word. So the tagger will not assign to a 
word, found in the training data, a tag that is never 
assigned to that word in the training data, even if 
that word should be assigned a new tag that was 
never assigned to the word in the training data. A 
word/tag dictionary is automatically built by col-
lecting all the words in the training corpus and the 
tags assigned to every word in the training corpus. 
The final output is produced in two steps. The 
first-stage POS tagger is applied on the testing data, 
and then the second-stage POS tagger is applied on 
the output of the first POS tagger. The second-
stage tagger uses features involving POS tags of 
the following one or two words. The features in-
volving the tags of following one or two words 
may be erroneous, since the tags assigned to the 
following one or two words by the first-stage tag-
ger may be incorrect. 
3 Evaluation Results 
Five corpora are provided for the Chinese part-of-
speech tagging task at the forth SIGHAN bakeoff. 
We selected four corpora, two in simplified Chi-
nese and two in traditional Chinese.

Table 3:  Training corpus size. 
 
Table 3 shows the training corpus size, the tagset 
size, and the average number of tags per token type.  
The NCC tagset has 60 tags, but nine of the tags 
occurred only once in the training corpus. In all 
four corpora, most of the unique tokens have only 
a single tag. The percentage of token types having 
single tag is 83.29% in CityU corpus; 91.09 in 
CKIP corpus; 94.67 in NCC corpus; and 90.27% in 
PKU corpus. The proportion of token types having 
single tag in CityU corpus is much lower than in 
NCC corpus. In the NCC corpus, the organization 
names, location names, and a sequence of English 
words are all treated as single token, and these long 
single tokens are not ambiguous and are assigned 
to a single part-of-speech tag in the corpus.

The baseline performance is computed by assign-
ing the most likely tag to each word in the testing 
data. When a word in the testing data is found in 
the training corpus, it is assigned the tag that is 
most frequently assigned to that word in the train-
ing corpus. A new word in the testing data is as-
signed the most frequent tag found in the training 
corpus, which is the common noun in all four cor-
pora. The baseline performances of the four testing

data sets are presented in Table 4, which also 
shows the percentage of new token/tag in the test-
ing data sets. 
    Our POS taggers are evaluated on four testing 
data sets, one corresponding to each training cor-
pus. We trained eight POS taggers, two on each 
training corpus, and submitted eight runs in total 
on the Chinese part-of-speech tagging task, two 
runs on each testing data set. The first run, labeled 
?a? in Table 5, is produced using the first-stage 
tagger, and the second run, labeled ?b? in Table 5, 
is the output of the second-stage tagger, which is 
applied to the output of the first tagger. For all of 
our runs, only the provided training data are used. 
Table 5 shows the official evaluation results of the 
eight runs we submitted in the close track. The 
third column, labeled ?Total-A?, shows the accu-
racy of the eight runs. The accuracy is the propor-
tion of correctly tagged words in a testing data set. 
Only one tag is assigned to every word in the test-
ing data set. The remaining three labels, ?IV-R?, 
?OOV-R?, and ?MT-R?, may be defined in The 
Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff overview paper.

4 Discussions 
A Chinese verb can function as a noun, and vice 
versa, without suffix change. In PKU corpus, a 
verb is labeled with the tag ?v?, and a verb that 
functions as a noun is labeled with the tag ?vn?. In 
the PKU-b run, almost half of the incorrectly 
tagged verbs (v) were tagged as verbal noun (vn), 
and slightly more than half of the incorrectly 
tagged verbal nouns (vn) were tagged as verb (v). 
The accuracy of our best runs on all four corpora 
is much higher than the baseline performance. On 
the PKU corpus, the accuracy is increased from the 
baseline performance of 0.8805 to 0.9450, an im-
provement of 7.33% over the baseline. The sec-
ond-stage tagging increased the accuracy on all 
four corpora. On the PKU corpus, the accuracy is 
increased by about 0.32% over the first-stage tag-
ging. The improvement may not seem to be large; 
however, it corresponds to an error reduction by 
5.4%.  
That the accuracy on the CityU corpus is the 
lowest among all four corpora is not surprising, 
given that the CityU testing data set has the highest 
out-of-vocabulary rate, and the CityU training cor-
pus has the highest average number of tags as-
signed to each token type. Furthermore, the CityU 
training corpus has the lowest percentage of tokens 
with only one tag. The POS tagging task on CityU 
corpus seems to be most challenging among the 
four corpora. 
5 Conclusions 
We have described a Chinese part-of-speech tagger 
with maximum entropy modeling. The tagger with 
rich lexical and morphological features signifi-
cantly outperforms the baseline system which as-
signs to a word the most likely tag assigned to that 
word in the training corpus. The use of features 
involving the part-of-speech tags of the following 
words further improves the performance of the 
tagger.
