Abstract 
This art ic le  int roduces a b id i rect iona l  
grammar generat ion system called feature 
structure-directed generation, developed for a 
dialogue translation system. The system 
utilizes typed feature structures to control the 
top-down derivation in a declarative way. This 
generation system also uses disjunctive feature 
structures to reduce the number of copies of 
the derivation tree. The grammar for this 
generator is designed to properly generate the 
speaker's intention in a telephone dialogue. 
1. Introduct ion 
It is important for the generation part of the 
dialogue translation system to reflect the 
speaker's intention ( i l locutionary force). To 
properly translate the illocutionary forces, the 
Intent ion Trans lat ion  Method has been 
developed at ATR (Kogure et al, 1989). This 
generator was developed as a part of the 
dialogue translation system. 
Bidirectional grammar is helpful in maintain- 
ing tile grammar/lexicon (Appelt, 1987). A 
feature structure representat ion has been 
adopted for analysis result and generation 
input because it can keep various information 
including i l locutionary forces and pragmatics 
in a consistent way. 
The infinite application of grammar rules is a 
common problem of the existing top-down 
unif icat ion-based generators (Shieber et al, 
1989). The solution adopted here is to control 
the generation process by selecting appro- 
priate rules to apply. Typed feature struc- 
tures (A~'t-Kaci, 1986) are utilized to describe 
the control of the generation process in a 
declarative way. This description can also be 
used to avoid the derivation of unnecessary 
trees and to increase the generation efficiency. 
Another problem of the top-down generators is 
making multiple copies of the phrase structure 
when the generat ion process encounters 
multiple rule candidates. This problem can be 
treated by introducing dis junct ive feature 
s t ruc tures .  
This article first describes the advantages of 
typed feature structures and dis junct ive 
feature structures in sections 2 and 3. The 
grammar for the generation system and the 
generation results are shown in section 4. The 
current status of this project and future tasks 
are described in section 5. 
2.  Introducing Typed Feature 
St ructures  
2.1 Selecting Appropriate Rules 
The basic mechanism of this generator is the 
top-down application of the grammar rules and 
construction of the feature structures of the 
daughter nodes. 
It is important to avoid the derivation of 
unnecessary phrase structures by selecting 
appropriate rules to apply in order to increase 
the efficiency. Consider the following rules 
taken from D-PATR (Karttunen, 1986). 
VP =HC*=> (VP XP) 
(<!m sem cont> == <!head-dtr sem cont>) 
(<lhead-dtr !subcat first> == <!comp-dtr-l>) 
(<!head-dtr Jsubcat rest> == <Jm !subcat>)) 
VP =CH=> (VP PP) 
(<!m sem cont> == <!head-dtr sem cont>) 
(<!head-dtr !subcat first> == <!comp-dtr-l>) 
(<Phead-dtr !subcat rest> == <!m isubcat>)) 
(1)I 
(2) 
The construct ion of the semantic repre- 
sentations given to the mother nodes of these 
~ In this rule, =HC*=> link shows that the first element 
of the right hand syml?~ls becomes the head daughter and 
the others the complement daughters. =CH=> link is 
also supplied for complement-head constructions. A 
symbol with an exclamation mark (!) indicates a 
predefined template. In this rule, !m stands for tile 
mother, i.e., the left-hand VP.

two rules are the same (predicate-argument 
structure), as can be seen below: 
ob je  re ln  p lay  
agen  john ' 
ob je  soccer '  
loc  a -park  '

Fig.1 Sample feature structure 
In generation, appropriate grammar rules must 
be selected using this representation. For this 
purpose, the difference between these feature 
structures must be found in the type of the key 
feature value's type. In this case, the reln 
(relation) feature plays the key role, and the 
value "play" must be of the verb type and "in" 
the prepositional type. 
Typed feature structures formulated by Ai"t- 
Kaci (1986) are introduced to handle types in 
feature structures, because,  types cannot be 
handled by ord inary  feature structure 
unification. Using typed feature structures, 
the following specifications can be attached to 
the former rules. 
For (1): (<!m sem cent rein> == \[V j) 
For (2): (<!m sere cent rein> == \[PJ) 
These specifications work as constraints to the 
rule application. The first specification shows 
that the <sere cont reln> feature of the node is 
unified to the type V (bracketed, shown in bold 
italics). If the unification succeeds, i.e., the 
<sem cont reln> feature is under V type in the 
type hierarchy, this grammar rule can be 
applied. The selection of appropriate grammar 
rules is thus accomplished in a declarative 
way. 
2.2 Avoiding Termination Problem 
There are various ways to utilize the type 
hierarchy. One example is subclassifying the 
categor ies.  
One of the termination problems Shieber et al 
(1989) pointed out is in the left-recursive 
rules. The rule (1) infinitely appends the 
subcat list to the daughter VP if the grammar 
is used for generation. This can be solved by 
restr ict ing the permiss ib le length of the 
subcat list t ? .  The maximum length of the 
subcat list is 2, excluding the subject. This 
restriction can be represented as follows. 
1"'\] Though the restriction cannot be applied to 
languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the 
limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation 
between Japanese and English). 
(:or (<lm lsubcat> == \[list-end\])) 
(<!m lsubcat rest> == \[list-end\])) 
However, this restriction forces the rule (2) to 
be applied twice to all verbs including 
intransitive verbs. Derivation of the phrase 
structures with incorrectly extended subcat 
lists will fail when the terminal is reached. 
This restriction can be solved more effectively 
using the type hierarchy.  If verbs are 
c lassi f ied into three subtypes (Monadic, 
Dyadic and Triadic) by the numbers of their 
arguments, the restriction in rule (1) can be 
written as follows. 
(:or ((<Im sem cent rein> == \[dyadic\]) 
(<!m !subcat> == \[list-end\])) 
((<!m sem cent rein> == \[triadic\]) 
(:or (<!m !subcat> == \[list-end\]) 
(<!m !subcat rest> == \[list-end\])) 
2.3 Relating Types and Categories 
Another function of the type hierarchy is 
using the types as a bridge between the 
semantics in the feature structure and the 
category in the CFG rules. Categories 
(nonterminal symbols) are also expressed by, 
and are closely related to, types. The following 
lexical entry def init ion shows that the 
complement of the verb is VP. 
(deflex "must" dyadic 
(<lsubcat first> == \[VPJ) 
? . .  ) 
If type VP is a subtype of XP, \[XP\] and \[VP\] are 
unified to bear \[VP\] when the lexical entry 
"must" is unified in rule (1). In D-PATR, such 
unspecif ied categories are treated by the 
system by introducing special symbols X, Y, 
etc. Typed feature structures serve as a sound 
foundation for this task. 
3. Introducing Disjunctive Feature 
Structure Unification 
Introduction of disjunctive feature structures 
solves the ineff ic iency caused by making 
copies of whole trees when a node can be 
applied to multiple candidates of rules. 
For example, multiple copying is caused by the 
mutual restriction between the subject and the 
verb (subcategorizing by verb and subject-verb 
agreement). The verb cannot be determined 
until the subject is determined and the 
derivation tree must be copied for each verb 
candidate.  
Instead of copying the derivation tree, the 
surface entries of a verb are packed into a 
2 65 
disjunctive feature structure in a lexical entry 
as follows. 
(DEFLEX-UNIT Ibe-Unitl DYADIC 
(:or (!finite-form !present-tense 
(:or ((<word> == "am") !lsg-subj-agr) 
((<word> == "are") 
(:or ((J2sg-subj-agr) (Jpl-subj-agr)))) 
((<word> == "is")!3sg-subj-agr) 
(!finite-form !past-tense 
. . . . . .  
When the derivation proceeds and the subject 
is determined, one surface string is selected 
from these three candidates (see Fig. 2). 
The unification of disjunctive feature struc- 
tures is implemented according to Kasper's 
algorithm (Kasper, 1987). 
4.  Grammar and Examples 
The grammar developed for this generation 
system is based on HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 
1987) and its modification by Borsley (1987). 
Relating illocutionary forces to utterances is 
achieved in this grammar. 
For example, consider the following feature 
structure including the REQUEST illocutionary 
force. 
\[CIRC\[RELN \[*REQUEST*\]\] 
\[AGEN ?X03\[ IND-OBJ\[LABEL *SPEAKER*\]\]\] 
\[RECP ?X02\[ IND-OBJ\[LABEL *HEARER*\]\]\] 
\[OBOE \[CIRC\[RELN \[*SEND-I*\]\] 
\[AGEN ?X02\] ; *HEARER* 
\[RECP ?X03\] ; *SPEAKER* 
\[OBOE !a-reg-form'\]\]\]\] 
;abbreviated here 
From this feature structure, the fol lowing 
generation results can be obtained. 
> (gen3 fs-l) 
("would you send me a registrat ion form" 
"could you send me a registrat ion form" 
"send me a registrat ion form") 
;; "send NP to NP" form is suppressed here. 
Specifying one of these results can be done by 
enriching the input feature structure. 
5.  Current Status and Further Tasks 
This article described how the generation pro- 
cess is effectively controlled by typed feature 
structures and disjunctive feature structures. 
The generation mechanism described here is 
implemented in Common Lisp on Symbolics 
Lisp Machines and Sun Workstations. A screen 
hardcopy of the environment is shown in Fig. 2. 
The grammar for this generation system is now 
under enrichment. The relationships between 
surface utterances and intentions need to be 
further explored. 
Kume et al (1989) and Kogure et al (1989) 
introduced il locutionary force type planning 
from deep illocutionary force type. Combining 
this method with the generator is the next task.
