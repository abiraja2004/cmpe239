In recent years, there is a phenomenal growth 
in the amount of online text material available 
from the greatest information repository known 
as the World Wide Web. Various traditional 
information retrieval(IR) techniques combined 
with natural language processing(NLP) tech- 
niques have been re-targeted to enable efficient 
access of the WWW--search engines, indexing, 
relevance feedback, query term and keyword 
weighting, document analysis, document clas- 
sification, etc. Most of these techniques aim at 
efficient online search for information already on 
the Web. 
Meanwhile, the corpus linguistic community 
regards the WWW as a vast potential of cor- 
pus resources. It is now possible to download 
a large amount of texts with automatic tools 
when one needs to compute, for example, a 
list of synonyms; or download domain-specific 
monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to 
the search engine, and then use this text to ex- 
tract domain-specific terms. It remains to be 
seen how we can also make use of the multilin- 
gual texts as NLP resources. 
In the years since the appearance of the first 
papers on using statistical models for bilin- 
gual lexicon compilation and machine transla- 
tion(Brown et al, 1993; Brown et al, 1991; 
Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard 
et al, 1992), large amount of human effort and 
time has been invested in collecting parallel cor- 
pora of translated texts. Our goal is to alleviate 
this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus re- 
sources by looking into monolingual, compara- 
ble texts. This type of texts are known as non- 
parallel corpora. Such nonparallel, monolingual 
texts should be much more prevalent than par- 
allel texts. However, previous attempts at using 
nonparallel corpora for terminology translation 
were constrained by the inadequate availability 
of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic 
form. The type of nonparallel texts obtained 
from the LDC or university libraries were of- 
ten restricted, and were usually out-of-date as 
soon as they became available. For new word 
translation, the timeliness of corpus resources 
is a prerequisite, so is the continuous and au- 
tomatic availability of nonparallel, comparable 
texts in electronic form. Data collection ef- 
fort should not inhibit the actual translation 
effort. Fortunately, nowadays the World Wide 
Web provides us with a daily increase of fresh, 
up-to-date multilingual material, together with 
the archived versions, all easily downloadable by 
software tools running in the background. It is 
possible to specify the URL of the online site of 
a newspaper, and the start and end dates, and 
automatically download all the daily newspaper 
materials between those dates. 
In this paper, we describe a new method 
which combines IR and NLP techniques to ex- 
tract new word translation from automatically 
downloaded English-Chinese nonparallel news- 
paper texts. 
2 Encounter ing  new words  
To improve the performance ofa machine trans- 
lation system, it is often necessary to update 
its bilingual lexicon, either by human lexicog- 
raphers or statistical methods using large cor- 
pora. Up until recently, statistical bilingual ex- 
icon compilation relies largely on parallel cor- 
pora. This is an undesirable constraint at times. 
In using a broad-coverage English-Chinese MT 
system to translate some text recently, we dis- 
covered that it is unable to translate ~,~,/li- 
ougan which occurs very frequently in the text. 
Other words which the system cannot find in 
its 20,000-entry lexicon include proper names 
414 
such as the Taiwanese president Lee Teng-Hui, 
and the Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee- 
Hwa. To our disappointment, we cannot lo- 
cate any parallel texts which include such words 
since they only start to appear frequently in re- 
cent months. 
A quick search on the Web turned up archives 
of multiple local newspapers in English and Chi- 
nese. Our challenge is to find the translation of 
~/l iougan and other words from this online 
nonparallel, comparable corpus of newspaper 
materials. We choose to use issues of the En- 
glish newspaper Hong Kong Standard and the 
Chinese newspaper Mingpao, from Dec.12,97 to 
Dec.31,97, as our corpus. The English text con- 
tains about 3 Mb of text whereas the Chinese 
text contains 8.8 Mb of 2 byte character texts. 
So both texts are comparable in size. Since they 
are both local mainstream newspapers, it is rea- 
sonable to assume that their contents are com- 
parable as well. 
3 YL~,/liougan is assoc ia ted  w i th  flu 
but  not  w i th  Africa 
Unlike in parallel texts, the position of a word 
in a text does not give us information about its 
translation in the other language. (Rapp, 1995; 
Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest hat a con- 
tent word is closely associated with some words 
in its context. As a tutorial example, we postu- 
late that the words which appear in the context 
of ~/l iougan should be similar to the words 
appearing in the context of its English trans- 
lation, flu. We can form a vector space model 
of a word in terms of its context word indices, 
similar to the vector space model of a text in 
terms of its constituent word indices (Salton and 
Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft, 
1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983; 
Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979). 
The value of the i-th dimension of a word 
vector W is f if the i-th word in the lexicon 
appears f times in the same sentences as W. 
Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show 
the list of content words which appear most fre- 
quently in the context of flu and Africa respec- 
tively. The right column shows those which oc- 
cur most frequently in the context of ~,~,. We 
can see that the context of ~ is more similar 
to that of flu than to that of Africa.

4 B i l ingua l  lex icon  as seed  words  
So the first clue to the similarity between a word 
and its translation umber of common words in 
their contexts. In a bilingual corpus, the "com- 
mon word" is actually a bilingual word pair. We 
use the lexicon of the MT system to "bridge" all 
bilingual word pairs in the corpora. These word 
pairs are used as seed words.  
We found that the contexts of flu and ~,~ 
/liougan share 233 "common" context words, 
whereas the contexts of Africa and ~,~/ l iougan 
share only 121 common words, even though the 
context of flu has 491 unique words and the con- 
text of Africa has 328 words. 
In the vector space model, W\[flu\] and 
W\[liougan\] has 233 overlapping dimensions, 
whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensions 
between W\[flu\] and W\[A frica\].

5 Us ing  TF / IDF  o f  contextua l  seed 
words  
The flu example illustrates that the actual rank- 
ing of the context word frequencies provides a 
second clue to the similarity between a bilingual 
word pair. For example, virus ranks very high 
for both flu and ~g~/l iougan and is a strong 
"bridge" between this bilingual word pair. This 
leads us to use the term frequency(TF) mea- 
sure. The TF of a context word is defined as 
the frequency of the word in the context of W. 
(e.g. TF of virus in flu is 26, in ~,~ is 147). 
However, the TF of a word is not indepen- 
dent of its general usage frequency. In an ex- 
treme case, the function word the appears most 
frequently in English texts and would have the 
highest TF in the context of any W. In our HK- 
Standard/Mingpao c rpus, Hong Kong is the 
most frequent content word which appears ev- 
erywhere. So in the flu example, we would like 
to reduce the significance of Hong Kong's TF 
while keeping that of virus. A common way to 
account for this difference is by using the inverse 
document frequency(IDF). Among the variants 
of IDF, we choose the following representation 
from (Jones, 1979): 
maxn 
IDF = log - -+ l  
ni 
where maxn = the maximum frequency of 
any word in the corpus 
ni = the total number of occurrences 
of word i in the corpus 
The IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of Hong 
Kong is 1.23 in the English text. The IDF of 
~,~ is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 in 
Chinese. So in both cases, virus is a stronger 
"bridge" for ~,~,/liougan than Hong Kong. 
Hence, for every context seed word i, we as- 
sign a word  we ight ing  factor  (Salton and 
Buckley, 1988) wi = TFiw x IDFi where TFiw 
is the TF of word i in the context of word W. 
The updated vector space model of word W has 
wi in its i-th dimension. 
The ranking of the 20 words in the contexts 
of ~/ l iougan is rearranged by this weighting 
factor as shown in Table3.

6 Rank ing  t rans la t ion  cand idates  
Next, a ranking algorithm is needed to match 
the unknown word vectors to their counterparts 
in the other language. A ranking algorithm se- 
lects the best target language candidate for a 
source language word according to direct com- 
parison of some similarity measures (Frakes and 
Baeza-Yates, 1992). 
We modify the similarity measure proposed 
by (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the following 
SO: 
so(wc, We) = 
t .2  ~/~'~i=l Wzc 
where Wic = TFic 
Wie = T Fie 
~=1 (Wic X Wie ) 
t 2 X Y\]~i=lWie 
Variants of similarity measures uch as the 
above have been used extensively in the IR com- 
munity (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992). They 
are mostly based on the Cosine Measure of two 
vectors. For different asks, the weighting fac- 
tor might vary. For example, if we add the IDF 
into the weighting factor, we get the following 
measure SI: 
t 
SI(Wc, We) = ~i=l(Wic ? Wie)  
t .2  t 2 ~/~i=lWzc X ~i=lWie 
where wic = TFic x IDFi 
Wie = TFie x IDFi 
416 
In addition, the Dice and Jaccard coefficients 
are also suitable similarity measures for doc- 
ument comparison (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 
1992). We also implement he Dice coefficient 
into similarity measure $2: 
t 2Ei=l (Wic X Wie) 
S2(W , We) = t .2  t .2  ~i=l W2c "~- ~i=l W~e 
where Wic = TFic x IDF i  
Wie = TFie x IDF i  
S1 is often used in comparing a short query 
with a document ext, whereas $2 is used in 
comparing two document exts. Reasoning that 
our objective falls somewhere in between--we 
are comparing segments of a document, we also 
multiply the above two measures into a third 
similarity measure $3. 
7 Conf idence  on  seed  word  pa i rs  
In using bilingual seed words such as IN~/v i rus 
as "bridges" for terminology translation, the 
quality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturally 
affects the system output. In the case of Eu- 
ropean language pairs such as French-English, 
we can envision using words sharing common 
cognates as these "bridges". Most importantly, 
we can assume that the word boundaries are 
similar in French and English. However, the 
situation is messier with English and Chinese. 
First, segmentation of the Chinese text into 
words already introduces ome ambiguity of the 
seed word identities. Secondly, English-Chinese 
translations are complicated by the fact that 
the two languages hare very little stemming 
properties, or part-of-speech set, or word order. 
This property causes every English word to have 
many Chinese translations and vice versa. In a 
source-target language translation scenario, the 
translated text can be "rearranged" and cleaned 
up by a monolingual language model in the tar- 
get language. However, the lexicon is not very 
reliable in establishing "bridges" between non- 
parallel English-Chinese texts. To compensate 
for this ambiguity in the seed lexicon, we intro- 
duce a conf idence  we ight ing  to each bilingual 
word pair used as seed words. If a word ie is the 
k- th  candidate for word ic, then wi,~ = wi,~/ki. 
The similarity scores then become $4 and $5 
and $6 = $4 x $5: 
~=l(Wic ? Wie)/ki 
S4(Wc,  We) = 
t .2 t 2 ~/~i=lWzc ? ~i=lWie 
where wic = TFic ? IDF i  
Wie = TFie x IDF i  
2~=l (Wic  x Wie)/ki s5(wc,  we) = t .2  t 2 Ei=lWzc + ~i=lWie 
where wic = TFic x IDF i  
wie = TFie x IDF i  
We also experiment with other combinations 
of the similarity scores such as $7 --- SO x $5. 
All similarity measures $3 - $7 are used in the 
experiment for finding a translation for ~,~,. 
8 Resu l ts  
In order to apply the above algorithm to find the 
translation for ~/ l iougan from the HKStan- 
dard/Mingpao corpus, we first use a script to 
select the 118 English content words which are 
not in the lexicon as possible candidates. Using 
similarity measures $3-$7 ,  the highest ranking 
candidates of ~ are shown in Table 6. $6 and 
$7 appear to be the best similarity measures. 
We then test the algorithm with $7 on more 
Chinese words which are not found in the lex- 
icon but which occur frequently enough in the 
Mingpao texts. A statistical new word extrac- 
tion tool can be used to find these words. The 
unknown Chinese words and their English coun- 
terparts, as well as the occurrence frequencies of 
these words in HKStandard/Mingpao are shown 
in Table 4. Frequency numbers with a * in- 
dicates that this word does not occur frequent 
enough to be found. Chinese words with a * 
indicates that it is a word with segmentation 
and translation ambiguities. For example, 
(Lam) could be a family name, or part of an- 
other word meaning forest. When it is used as 
a family name, it could be transliterated into 
Lam in Cantonese or Lin in Mandarin. 
Disregarding all entries with a * in the above 
table, we apply the algorithm to the rest of the 
Chinese unknown words and the 118 English un- 
known words from HKStandard. The output is 
ranked by the similarity scores. The highest 
ranking translated pairs are shown in Table 5. 
The only Chinese unknown words which are 
not correctly translated in the above list are

almost all unambiguous Chinese new words find

lation as their first candidate.

1994) for sense disambiguation between mul- 
tiple usages of the same word. Some of the 
early statistical terminology translation meth- 
ods are (Brown et al, 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; 
Dagan and Church, 1994; Gale and Church, 
1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al, 1996; Kay 
and RSscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; 
Fung, 1995b). These algorithms all require par- 
allel, translated texts as input. Attempts at 
exploring nonparallel corpora for terminology 
translation are very few (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 
1995a; Fung and McKeown, 1997). Among 
these, (Rapp, 1995) proposes that the associ- 
ation between a word and its close collocate 
is preserved in any language, and (Fung and 
McKeown, 1997) suggests that the associations 
between a word and many seed words are also 
preserved in another language. In this paper, 
418 
we have demonstrated that the associations be- 
tween a word and its context seed words are 
well-preserved in nonparallel, comparable texts 
of different languages. 
10 Discuss ions  
Our algorithm is the first to have generated a 
collocation bilingual exicon, albeit small, from 
a nonparallel, comparable corpus. We have 
shown that the algorithm has good precision, 
but the recall is low due to the difficulty in 
extracting unambiguous Chinese and English 
words. 
Better results can be obtained when the fol- 
lowing changes are made: 
? improve seed word lexicon reliability by 
stemming and POS tagging on both En- 
glish and Chinese texts; 
? improve Chinese segmentation by using a 
larger monolingual Chinese lexicon; 
? use larger corpus to generate more un- 
known words and their candidates by sta- 
tistical methods; 
We will test the precision and recall of the 
algorithm on a larger set of unknown words. 
11 Conc lus ions  
We have devised an algorithm using context  
seed word  TF / IDF  for extracting bilingual 
lexicon from nonpara l le l ,  comparab le  cor- 
pus  in English-Chinese. This algorithm takes 
into account the reliability of bilingual seed 
words and is language independent. This al- 
gorithm can be applied to other language pairs 
such as English-French or English-German. In 
these cases, since the languages are more sim- 
ilar linguistically and the seed word lexicon is 
more reliable, the algorithm should yield bet- 
ter results. This algorithm can also be applied 
in an iterative fashion where high-ranking bilin- 
gual word pairs can be added to the seed word 
list, which in turn can yield more new bilingual 
word pairs.
