Abstract
In this paper we are reporting the re-
sults obtained participating in the ?Eval-
uating Word Sense Induction and Dis-
crimination Systems? task of Semeval
2007. Our totally unsupervised system
performed an automatic self-term expan-
sion process by mean of co-ocurrence
terms and, thereafter, it executed the
unsupervised KStar clustering method.
Two ranking tables with different eval-
uation measures were calculated by the
task organizers, every table with two
baselines and six runs submitted by dif-
ferent teams. We were ranked third
place in both ranking tables obtaining a
better performance than three different
baselines, and outperforming the average
score.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a partic-
ular problem of computational linguistics which
consists in determining the correct sense for a
given ambiguous word. It is well-known that su-
pervised algorithms have obtained the best re-
sults in public evaluations, but their accuracy
is close related with the amount of hand-tagged
data available. The construction of that kind
of training data is difficult for real applications.
The unsupervised WSD overcomes this draw-
back by using clustering algorithms which do

not need training data in order to determine the
possible sense for a given ambiguous word.
This paper describes a simple technique for
unsupervised sense induction for ambiguous
words. The approach is based on a self term ex-
pansion technique which constructs a set of co-
ocurrence terms and, thereafter, it uses this set
to expand the target dataset. The implemented
system was performed in the task ?SemEval-
2007 Task 2: Evaluating Word Sense Induc-
tion and Discrimination Systems?(Agirre and
A., 2007). The aim of the task was to per-
mit a comparison across sense-induction and dis-
crimination systems. Moreover, the comparison
with other supervised and knowledge-based sys-
tems may be also done, since the test corpus was
borrowed from the well known ?English lexical-
sample? task in SemEval-2007, with the usual
training + test split.
The self term expansion method consists in
replacing terms of a document by a set of co-
related terms. The goal is to improve natu-
ral language processing tasks such as cluster-
ing narrow-domain short texts. This process
may be done by mean of different ways, of-
ten just by using a knowledge database. In
information retrieval, for instance, the expan-
sion of query terms is a very investigated topic
which has shown to improve results with respect
to when query expansion is not employed (Qiu
and Frei, 1993; Ruge, 1992; R.Baeza-Yates and
Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Grefenstette, 1994; Rijsber-
gen, 1979).
The availability of Machine Readable Re-
sources (MRR) like ?Dictionaries?, ?Thesauri?
and ?Lexicons? has allowed to apply term ex-
430
pansion to other fields of natural language pro-
cessing like WSD. In (Banerjee and Pedersen,
2002) we may see the typical example of using
a external knowledge database for determining
the correct sense of a word given in some con-
text. In this approach, every word close to the
one we would like to determine its correct sense
is expanded with its different senses by using
the WordNet lexicon (Fellbaum, 1998). Then,
an overlapping factor is calculated in order to
determine the correct sense of the ambiguous
word. Different other approaches have made use
of a similar procedure. By using dictionaries,
the proposals presented in (Lesk, 1986; Wilks et
al., 1990; Nancy and Ve?ronis, 1990) are the most
sucessful in WSD. Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1992)
used instead thesauri for their experiments. Fi-
nally, in (Sussna, 1993; Resnik, 1995; Baner-
jee and Pedersen, 2002) the use of lexicons in
WSD has been investigated. Although in some
cases the knowledge resource seems not to be
used strictly for term expansion, the aplication
of co-occurrence terms is included in their algo-
rithms. Like in information retrieval, the appli-
cation of term expansion in WSD by using co-
related terms has shown to improve the baseline
results if we carefully select the external resource
to use, with a priori knowledge of the domain
and the broadness of the corpus (wide or nar-
row domain). Evenmore, we have to be sure that
the Lexical Data Base (LDB) has been suitable
constructed. Due to the last facts, we consider
that the use of a self automatically constructed
LDB (using the same test corpora), may be of
high benefit. This assumption is based on the
intrinsic properties extracted from the corpus it-
self. Our proposal is related somehow with the
investigations presented in (Schu?tze, 1998) and
(Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), where words
are also expanded with co-ocurrence terms for
word sense discrimination. The main difference
consists in the use of the same corpora for con-
structing the co-ocurrence list.
Following we describe the self term expan-
sion method used and, thereafter, the results
obtained in the task #2 of Semeval 2007 com-
petition.
2 The Self Term Expansion Method
In literature, co-ocurrence terms is the most
common technique used for automatic construc-
tion of LDBs (Grefenstette, 1994; Frakes and
Baeza-Yates, 1992). A simple approach may use
n-grams, which allows to predict a word from
previous words in a sample of text. The fre-
quency of each n-gram is calculated and then
filtered according to some threshold. The re-
sulting n-grams constitutes a LDB which may
be used as an ?expansion dictionary? for each
term.
On the other hand, an information theory-
based co-ocurrence measure is discussed in
(Manning and Schu?tze, 2003). This measure
is named pointwise Mutual Information (MI),
and its applications for finding collocations are
analysed by determining the co-ocurrence de-
gree among two terms. This may be done by cal-
culating the ratio between the number of times
that both terms appear together (in the same
context and not necessarily in the same order)
and the product of the number of times that
each term ocurrs alone. Given two terms X1
and X2, the pointwise mutual information be-
tween X1 and X2 can be calculated as follows:
MI(X1,X2) = log2
P (X1X2)
P (X1)? P (X2)
The numerator could be modified in order to
take into account only bigrams, as presented
in (Pinto et al, 2006), where an improvement
of clustering short texts in narrow domains has
been obtained.
We have used the pointwise MI for obtaining
a co-ocurrence list from the same target dataset.
This list is then used to expand every term of the
original data. Since the co-ocurrence formula
captures relations between related terms, it is
possible to see that the self term expansion mag-
nifies less the noisy than the meaninful informa-
tion. Therefore, the execution of the clustering
algorithm in the expanded corpus should out-
perform the one executed over the non-expanded
data.
In order to fully appreciate the self term ex-
pansion method, in Table 1 we show the co-
431
ocurrence list for some words related with the
verb ?kill? of the test corpus. Since the MI
is calculated after preprocessing the corpus, we
present the stemmed version of the terms.
Word Co-ocurrence terms

rape women think shoot peopl old man

grenad todai live guerrilla fight explod
death shoot run rape person peopl outsid
murder life lebanon kill convict...
temblor tuesdai peopl least kill earthquak
Table 1: An example of co-ocurrence terms
For the task #2 of Semeval 2007, a set of 100
ambiguous words (35 nouns and 65 verbs) were
provided. We preprocessed this original dataset
by eliminating stopwords and then applying the
Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980). Thereafter,
when we used the pointwise MI, we determined
that the single ocurrence of each term should
be at least three (see (Manning and Schu?tze,
2003)), whereas the maximum separation among
the two terms was five. Finally, we selected
the unsupervised KStar clustering method (Shin
and Han, 2003) for our experiments, defining the
average of similarities among all the sentences
for a given ambiguous word as the stop criterion
for this clustering method. The input similarity
matrix for the clustering method was calculated
by using the Jaccard coefficient.
3 Evaluation
The task organizers decided to use two differ-
ent measures for evaluating the runs submitted
to the task. The first measure is called unsuper-
vised one, and it is based on the Fscore measure.
Whereas the second measure is called supervised
recall. For further information on how these
measures are calculated refer to (Agirre et al,
2006a; Agirre et al, 2006b). Since these mea-
sures give conflicting information, two different
evaluation results are reported in this paper.
In Table 2 we may see our ranking and the Fs-
core measure obtained (UPV-SI). We also show
the best and worst team Fscores; as well as the
total average and two baselines proposed by the
task organizers. The first baseline (Baseline1)
assumes that each ambiguous word has only one
sense, whereas the second baseline (Baseline2) is
a random assignation of senses. We are ranked
as third place and our results are better scored
than the other teams except for the best team
score. However, given the similar values with
the ?Baseline1?, we may assume that that team
presented one cluster per ambiguous word as its
result as the Baseline1 did; whereas we obtained
9.03 senses per ambiguous word in average.
Name Rank All Nouns Verbs
Baseline1 1 78.9 80.7 76.8
Best Team 2 78.7 80.8 76.3
UPV-SI 3 66.3 69.9 62.2
Average - 63.6 66.5 60.3
Worst Team 7 56.1 65.8 45.1
Baseline2 8 37.8 38.0 37.6
Table 2: Unsupervised evaluation (Fscore per-
formance).
In Table 3 we show our ranking and the super-
vised recall obtained (UPV-SI). We again show
the best and worst team recalls. The total av-
erage and one baseline is also presented (the
other baseline obtained the same Fscore). In
this case, the baseline tags each test instance
with the most frequent sense obtained in a train
split. We are ranked again in third place and
our score is slightly above the baseline.
Name Rank All Nouns Verbs
Best Team 1 81.6 86.8 76.2
UPV-SI 3 79.1 82.5 75.3
Average - 79.1 82.8 75.0
Baseline 4 78.7 80.9 76.2
Worst Team 6a 78.5 81.8 74.9
Worst Team 6b 78.5 81.4 75.2
Table 3: Supervised evaluation (Recall).
The results show that the technique employed
have learned, since our simple approach ob-
tained a better performance than the baselines,
especially the one that have chosen the most fre-
quent sense as baseline.

4 Conclusions
We have reported the performance of a single
approach based on self term expansion. The
technique uses the pointwise mutual information
for calculating a set of co-ocurrence terms which
then are used to expand the original dataset.
Once the expansion has been done, the unsu-
pervised KStar clustering method was used to
induce the sense for the different ocurrences of
each ambiguous word. We obtained the third
place in the two measures proposed in the task.
We will further investigate whether an improve-
ment may be obtained by applying term selec-
tion methods to the expanded corpus.
