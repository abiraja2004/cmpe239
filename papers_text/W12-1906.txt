Abstract
Some of the most used models for statis-
tical word alignment are the IBM models.
Although these models generate acceptable
alignments, they do not exploit the rich in-
formation found in lexical resources, and as
such have no reasonable means to choose bet-
ter translations for specific senses.
We try to address this issue by extending the
IBM HMM model with an extra hidden layer
which represents the senses a word can take,
allowing similar words to share similar output
distributions. We test a preliminary version of
this model on English-French data. We com-
pare different ways of generating senses and
assess the quality of the alignments relative to
the IBM HMM model, as well as the gener-
ated sense probabilities, in order to gauge the
usefulness in Word Sense Disambiguation.
1 Introduction
Modern machine translation is dominated by statis-
tical methods, most of which are trained on word-
aligned parallel corpora (Koehn et al, 2007; Koehn,
2004), which need to be generated separately. One
of the most commonly used methods to generate
these word alignments is to use the IBM models 1-5,
which generate one-directional alignments.
Although the IBM models perform well, they fail
to take into account certain situations. For exam-
ple, if an alignment between two words f1 and e1 is
considered, and f1 is an uncommon translation for
e1, the translation probability will be low. It might
happen, that an alignment to a different nearby word
is preferred by the model. Consider for example
the situation where f1 is ?taal? (Dutch, meaning lan-
guage), and e1 is ?tongue?. The translation probabil-
ity for this may be low, as ?tongue? usually translates
as ?tong?, meaning the body part. In this case the
preference of the alignment model may dominate,
leading to the wrong alignment.
Moreover, the standard tools for word alignment
fail to make use of the lexical resources that already
exist, and which could contribute useful information
for the task. In particular, the ontology defined in
WordNet (Miller, 1995) could be put to good use.
Intuitively, the translation of a word should depend
on the sense of the word being used. The current
work seeks to explore this idea, by explicitly mod-
eling the senses in the translation process. It does
so, by modifying the HMM alignment model to in-
clude synsets as an intermediate stage of translation.
This would facilitate sharing of translation distribu-
tions between words with similar senses that should
generate the correct sense. In terms of the example
above, one of the senses for ?tongue? will share the
translation distribution with ?language?, for which
we will have more relevant translation probabilities.
As well as performing word alignment this model
can be used to generate sense annotations on one
side of a parallel corpus, given an alignment, or even
generate sense annotations while aligning a corpus.
Thus, the model could learn to align a corpus and
do WSD at the same time. In this paper, the effect
the usage of senses has on alignment is investigated,
and the potential usefulness of the model for WSD
is explored. In the next section related work is dis-
cussed, after which in section 3 the current model is
39
discussed.
In section 4 the evaluation of the model is dis-
cussed, in two parts. In the first part, the model is
evaluated for English-French on gold standard man-
ually aligned data and compared to the results of the
base HMM model. In the second part, the model is
qualitatively evaluated by inspecting the senses and
associated output distributions of selected words.
2 Previous Work
Although most researchers agree that Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) is a useful field, it hasn?t
been shown to consistently help in related tasks. Ma-
chine Translation is no exception, and whether or
not WSD systems can improve performance of MT
systems is debated. Furthermore, it is unclear how
parallel corpuses can be exploited for WSD systems.
In this section we will present a brief overview of re-
lated work.
(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) report an improvement
in translation quality by incorporating a WSD sys-
tem directly in a phrase-based translation system.
This is in response to earlier work done, where in-
corporating the output of a traditional WSD system
gave disappointing results (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).
The WSD task is redefined, to be similar to choosing
the correct phrasal translation for a word, instead of
choosing a sense from a sense inventory. This sys-
tem is trained on the same data as the SMT system
is.
The output of this model is incorporated into the
machine translation system by providing the WSD
probabilities for a phrase translation as extra features
in a log-linear model (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). This
system consistently outperforms the baseline system
(the same system, but without WSD component), on
multiple metrics, which seems to indicate that WSD
can make a useful contribution to machine transla-
tion. However, the way the system is set up, it could
also be viewed as a way of incorporating translation
probabilities of other systems into the phrase-based
translation model.
(Chan and Ng, 2007) introduce a system very sim-
ilar to that of (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), but as ap-
plied to hierarchical phrase-based translation. They
demonstrate modest improvements in BLEU score
over the unmodified system, as well as some qualita-
tive improvements in the output. Here again, the ar-
gument could be made that what is being done is not
strictly word sense disambiguation, but augmenting
the translation system with extra features for some
of the phrase translations.
In (Tufis? et al, 2004) parallel corpora and aligned
WordNets are exploited for WSD. This is done, by
word aligning the parallel texts, and then for ev-
ery aligned pair, generating a set of wordnet sense
codes (ILI codes, or interlingual index codes) for ei-
ther word, corresponding to the possible senses that
word can take. As the wordnets for both languages
are linked, if the ILI code of a sense is the same, the
sense should be sufficiently similar. Thus, the in-
tersection of both sets of ILI is taken to find an ILI
code that is common to both pairs. If such a code is
found, it represents the sense index of both words.
Otherwise, the closest ILI code to the two most sim-
ilar ILI codes is found, and that is taken as the sense
for the word. The current work however only uses
a lexical resource for one of the languages, and as
such has fewer places to fail, and less demanding
requirements.
Other similar work includes that in (Ng et al,
2003), where a sense-annotated corpus was automat-
ically generated from a parallel corpus. This is done
by word-aligning the parallel corpus, and then find-
ing the senses according to WordNet given a list of
nouns. Two senses are lumped together if they are
translated into the same chinese word. The selec-
tion of correct translations is done manually. Only
those occurrences of the chosen nouns that translate
to one of the chosen chinese words are considered
sense-tagged by the translation.
Although similar in approach to what the current
system would do, this system uses a much more sim-
ple approach to generate sense annotations and it de-
pends on a previously word-aligned corpus, whereas
the current approach would integrate alignment and
sense-tagging, whis may give a higher accuracy.
3 Senses Model
The current model is based on the HMM alignment
model (Vogel et al, 1996), as it is a less complex
model than IBM models 3 and above, but still finds
acceptable alignments. The HMM alignment model
is defined as a HMM model, where the observed
40

nodes indicate hidden variables.
variables are the words of a sentence in the French
language f, and the hidden variables are alignments
to words in the English sentence e, or to a null state.
See figure 1 for a diagram of the standard HMM
model. Under this model, French words can align to
at most 1 English word. The transition probability
is not dependent on the english words themselves,
but on the size of jumps between alignments and the
length of the English sentence. The probability of
the French sentence given the English sentence is:
Pr(f|e) =
?
a
J?
j=1
p(fj |eaj )p(aj |aj?1, I) (1)
Here, f and e denote the French and English sen-
tences, which have lengths J and I respectively, and
a denotes an alignment of these two sentences. So,
the states in the HMM assign a number from the
range [0, I] to each of the positions j in the French
sentence, effectively assigning one English word eaj
to each French word fj , or a NULL translation e0.
The term p(fj |eaj ) is the translation probability of a
pair of words, and p(aj |aj?1, I) gives the transition
probability in the HMM.
Here, i is the current state of the HMM, and i? is
the previous state of the HMM, each being an index
into the English sentence and p(aj |aj?1, I) is de-
fined as the probability of the gap between i and i?.
So, if in an alignment French word 2 is aligned to the
3rd English word, and the next French Word (3) is
aligned to the 5th English word, p(aj |aj?1, I) isn?t
modelled directly as p(5|3, I), but as p(5? 3|I).
To implement a dependency on senses in the
model an extra hidden layer is added to the HMM
model, representing the senses. The probability of a

french word then depends on the generated sense,
the probability of which depends on the English.
The possible senses for a given English word is con-
strained by an external source, such as WordNet.
The probability under the model of a french sen-
tence f given an English sentence e thus becomes:
Pr(f|e) =
?
a

j=1
p?(fj |eaj )p(aj |aj?1, I) (2)
where
p?(fj |eaj ) =
K?
k=1
p(fj |sk)p(sk|eaj ) (3)
Here, K is the number of senses that english word
associated with this translation pair. The senses will
be constrained either by the English word eaj or by
the French word fj depending on which language
the sense inventory is taken from. The first case,
with senses constrained by the English, will be de-
noted with SHMM1, and the second with SHMM2.
In this work, only SHMM1 is used.
If the amount of senses defined for each word is
exactly 1 and this sense is different for each word,
the model reduces to the HMM model (see Figure
2). However, if the sense inventory is defined such
that for two different words with a sense that is sim-
ilar, the same sense can be used, the model is able
to use translation probabilities drawn from observa-
tions from both these words together. For example,
41
in SHMM1, the words ?small? and ?little? may have
the same sense listed in the sense inventory, which
allows the model to learn a translation distribution to
the French words that both these words often align
to.
For training this model, as with the IBM models,
Expectation-Maximization and initialisation are key.
The more complex IBM models are initialised from
simpler versions, so the complex models can start
out with reasonable estimates, which allow it to find
good alignments. Here, too, the same steps are used.
The HMM model is initialised from Model 1, as de-
scribed in citevogel:1996. From this, the SHMM
models can be initialised.
For the SHMM1, given a translation probability
for a french word given an english word under the
HMM, p(f |e), and a list of valid senses for that
english word e, an equal portion of that translation
probability is given to the new translation probabil-
ity depending on the sense. This is done for all trans-
lation probabilities, and the translation table is then
normalised. Probability of a sense given an english
word is initialised to a uniform distribution over the
valid senses.
For the SHMM2, the probability of french words
given a sense is set to uniform over the words for
which the sense is valid, and the probability of the
sense given the english word is calculated analogous
to the probability of the french word given the sense
in the first case.
After initialisation, the expectation-maximisation
algorithm can be used for training, as with the HMM
model, using the forward-backward algorithm to
find the posterior probabilities of the alignments. As
the senses can be summed out during this phase, the
algorithm can be used as-is, and afterwards the pro-
portion of the partial count that should be assigned
to each sense can be found. By summing out over
the relevant senses and words, the two parts c(fj |qk)
and c(qk|ei) can then be found.
3.1 Generating Senses for Words
In order to be able to use this model, an inventory
of senses is needed for every word in the corpus, for
one of the languages. The most obvious source for
this is the English Wordnet (Miller, 1995), as it has
a large inventory of senses. Note that, in this doc-
ument, the words senses and synsets are used inter-
changeably.
The process of obtaining this inventory is ex-
plained from the viewpoint of using English Word-
Net, but the same basic conditions apply for any
other lexicon, or language. The inventory of senses
is obtained through the WordNet corpus in NLTK
1, which automatically stems the words that synsets
are sought for.
In this model, two senses (synsets) are function-
ally equivalent, if the list of words that have them
in their senselist is the same for both senses. That
is to say, if the partial counts that will be added to
either of the senses will be the same, there is no way
of distinguishing between the two senses under this
model. For example, in WordNet 3.0, among the
synsets listed for the word ?small?, there are 3 that
have as constituent words only ?small? and ?little?.
These 3 synsets would be functionally equivalent for
our purposes. When this occurs, the senses that are
equivalent are collated under one name, so that it?s
possible to find out which senses a particular sense
is made up of.
At this point, there will be some words with only
a sense that is unique to that word (such as those
words that were not in the lexicon, which get a newly
made sense), some words with only shared senses
and some with a mix. We might want to enforce one
of a few distinct options:
? All words have exactly 1 unique sense, and per-
haps a few shared ones (?synthesis? condition)
? Some words have a unique sense, some don?t
(?merge? condition)
? No words have unique senses if they have at
least 1 shared sense (?none? condition)
These conditions are generated by first finding the
filtered list of senses for each word. At this point,
some words have only unique senses, either because
they didn?t occur in WordNet, or because WordNet
only listed unique senses for that word (the ?merge?
condition. The ?synth? condition is made, by finding
all words that have only shared senses, and adding a
new sense, that is unique to that word. The ?none?

condition then is found by doing the opposite: re-
moving all unique senses from words that also have
shared senses.
Under each of these 3 conditions, the model might
work slightly differently. Under the ?synthesis? con-
dition, it may generate the translation probabilities
either directly, as in the HMM (which is what hap-
pens for any word with only 1 sense, which is unique
for that word), or from the shared probabilities,
through the senses. In the other models, the model
is increasingly forced to use the shared translation
probabilities.
4 Evaluation
We will evaluate the early results of this model
against the HMM and Model 1 results, and will do
a qualitative analysis of the distribution over senses
and French words that the model obtains, in order
to find out if reasonable predictions for senses are
made.
The sense HMM model will be evaluated using
the three sense inventories suggested in subsection
3.1. The dataset used was a 1 million sentence
aligned English-French corpus, taken from the Eu-
roparl corpus (Koehn, 2005). The data was to-
kenised, length limited to a maximum length of 50,
and lowercased. The results are evaluated on the test
set from the ACL 2005 shared task, using Alignment
Error Rate. The models are all trained for 5 itera-
tions, and a pruning threshold is employed that re-
moves probabilities from the translation tables if it
is below 1.0 ? 10?6.
The results of training models based on senses
generated in the 3 ways listed above is shown in
Figure 3. The three SHMM models are compared
against Model 1, and the standard HMM model,
each of which is trained for 5 iterations. The HMM
model is initialised from Model 1, and the SHMM
models initialised from the HMM model. As the fig-
ure shows, the AER score for the last two iterations
of the HMM model is very similar to the scores that
the three variations of the SHMM model attain. The
scores for the three HMM models range from 0.185
to 0.192
A possible reason for this performance is that the
models didn?t have enough sharing going on be-
tween the senses. The corpus contains 70700 unique
words. Looking at the amount of senses that are
found in the ?none? condition, meaning that all of the
WordNet senses share output probabilities, there are
17194 words that have at least one of these senses
listed, and there are 27120 distinct senses available
in that setting. For the other 53500 senses, no shar-
ing is going on whatsoever.
In the ?merge? and ?synth? conditions, there are
more senses taken from WordNet (for a total from
WordNet of 33133), but these don?t add any shar-

ing. It might be then, that the model has insuffi-
cient opportunity to share output distributions, caus-
ing it to behave much as the HMM alignment model.
Another possibility is, that the senses insufficiently
well-defined, and share probabilities between words
that are too dissimilar, negating any positive effect
this may have and possibly pushing the model to-
wards less sharing. We will suggest possibilities for
dealing with this in section 5.
Regardless of the performance of the model in
word alignment, if the model learns probabilities for
senses that are reasonable, it can be used as a word
sense disambiguation system for parallel corpora,
with the candidate senses being made up from the
senses out of WordNet. Those words not listed in
WordNet, are treated as being monosemous words
in this context. The ?merge? and ?none? conditions
are most useful for this: if a WSD system chooses a
sense that is not linked to a WordNet sense, it is not
clearly defined which sense is meant here.
In order to find out if the model makes sensi-
ble distinctions between different senses, we have
picked a random polysemous word, and looked at
the senses associated with it in the ?none? condition.
The word that was chosen is ?severe?. It has 6 pos-

As the table shows, the two most likely senses are
quite similar. In fact, because words are stemmed
before looking up suitable senses, all senses have at
least the following 3 words associated with them:
?severe?, ?severer? and ?severest?. The words that

cause the differences between the senses are listed
in table 2. It can be seen that the only difference
between severe.s.04 and severe.s.06 is the addition
of the word ?spartan? for the first. As ?spartan? only
occurs 67 times in the corpus, versus 484 for severe,
it is possible that they are so similar, because the
counts for ?spartan? get overshadowed.
For the other senses however, the most likely
translations vary quite a bit. The sense ?hard.s.04?,
meaning very strong or vigorous, also includes
translations to ?plus? and ?dur?, which seems more
likely given the sense. Given these translation prob-
abilities though, it should at least be possible to dis-
tinguish between different senses of the word severe,
given that it?s aligned to a different french word.
One more example is listed in table 3, showing
the probabilities for two different senses, and their
most likely translations. The most likely sense for
rigorous under the model is in the sense of ?allowing
no deviation from a standard?. This is the only of the
two senses that can translate to ?rigueur? in french,
literally rigor. The other sense, meaning ?demand-
ing strict attention to rules and procedures?, is more
likely to translate to ?strictes?, ?stricte? and ?se?ve`res?,
which reflects the WordNet definition.
The difference in contributing English words be-
tween these two senses can be found in Table 4. In-
terestingly, the three forms of the word strict are as-
sociated with the sense rigorous.s.01, even though
the naive translations of these words into French are
more likely for rigorous.s.02. Even so, the results
match the WordNet definitions better.
These results show that useful translations are
found, and the corresponding senses can be learned
as well. For sense discrimination in parallel cor-
puses then, this model shows potential, and for

5 Conclusion
The results have shown that this may be a useful way
to incorporate senses in a word alignment system.
While the alignment results in themselves weren?t
significantly better, alignment probabilities to senses
have been shown to be generated, which make it pos-
sible to distinguish between different senses. This
could open the door to automatically sense annotat-
ing parallel corpora, using a predefined set of senses.
At this early point, several options lay open to
improve upon the results so far. To improve the
alignment results, more encompassing senses may
be generated, for example by integrating similar
synsets. At the same time, the list of synsets for
each word may be improved upon, by filtering out
very unlikely senses for a word.
It should also be possible to employ an already ex-
isting WSD system to annotate the parallel corpus,
and use the counts of the annotated senses to better
initialise the senses, rather than starting out assum-
ing all are equaly likely for a given word. This may
be used as well to initialise the translation probabil-
ities for senses.
