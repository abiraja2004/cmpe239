Abstract
Existing works indicate that the absence
of explicit discourse connectives makes
it difficult to recognize implicit discourse
relations. In this paper we attempt to
overcome this difficulty for implicit rela-
tion recognition by automatically insert-
ing discourse connectives between argu-
ments with the use of a language model.
Then we propose two algorithms to lever-
age the information of these predicted
connectives. One is to use these pre-
dicted implicit connectives as additional
features in a supervised model. The other
is to perform implicit relation recognition
based only on these predicted connectives.
Results on Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0
show that predicted discourse connectives
help implicit relation recognition and the
first algorithm can achieve an absolute av-
erage f-score improvement of 3% over a
state of the art baseline system.
1 Introduction
Discourse relation analysis is to automatically
identify discourse relations (e.g., explanation re-
lation) that hold between arbitrary spans of text.
This analysis may be a part of many natural lan-
guage processing systems, e.g., text summariza-
tion system, question answering system. If there
are discourse connectives between textual units
to explicitly mark their relations, the recognition
task on these texts is defined as explicit discourse
relation recognition. Otherwise it is defined as im-
plicit discourse relation recognition.
Previous study indicates that the presence of
discourse connectives between textual units can
greatly help relation recognition. In Penn Dis-
course Treebank (PDTB) corpus (Prasad et al,
2008), the most general senses, i.e., Comparison
(Comp.), Contingency (Cont.), Temporal (Temp.)
and Expansion (Exp.), can be disambiguated in
explicit relations with more than 90% f-scores
based only on the discourse connectives explicitly
used to signal the relation (Pitler and Nenkova.,
2009b).
However, for implicit relations, there are no
connectives to explicitly mark the relations, which
makes the recognition task quite difficult. Some of
existing works attempt to perform relation recog-
nition without hand-annotated corpora (Marcu
and Echihabi, 2002), (Sporleder and Lascarides,
2008) and (Blair-Goldensohn, 2007). They use
unambiguous patterns such as [Arg1, but Arg2]
to create synthetic examples of implicit relations
and then use [Arg1, Arg2] as an training example
of an implicit relation. Another research line is
to exploit various linguistically informed features
under the framework of supervised models, (Pitler
et al, 2009a) and (Lin et al, 2009), e.g., polarity
features, semantic classes, tense, production rules
of parse trees of arguments, etc.
Our study on PDTB test data shows that the av-
erage f-score for the most general 4 senses can
reach 91.8% when we simply mapped the ground
truth implicit connective of each test instance to
its most frequent sense. It indicates the impor-
tance of connective information for implicit rela-
tion recognition. However, so far there is no previ-
ous study attempting to use such kind of connec-
tive information for implicit relation. One possi-
1507
ble reason is that implicit connectives do not ex-
ist in unannotated real texts. Another evidence
of the importance of connectives for implicit re-
lations is shown in PDTB annotation. The PDTB
annotation consists of inserting a connective ex-
pression that best conveys the inferred relation by
the readers. Connectives inserted in this way to
express inferred relations are called implicit con-
nectives, which do not exist in real texts. These
evidences inspire us to consider two interesting re-
search questions:
(1) Can we automatically predict implicit connec-
tives between arguments?
(2) How to use the predicted implicit connectives
to build an automatic discourse relation analysis
system?
In this paper we address these two questions as
follows: (1) We insert appropriate discourse con-
nectives between two textual units with the use of
a language model. Here we train the language
model on large amount of raw corpora without
the use of any hand-annotated data. (2) Then we
present two algorithms to use these predicted con-
nectives for implicit relation recognition. One is
to use these connectives as additional features in a
supervised model. The other is to perform relation
recognition based only on these connectives.
We performed evaluation of the two algorithms
and a baseline system on PDTB 2.0 corpus. Ex-
perimental results showed that using predicted
discourse connectives as additional features can
significantly improve the performance of implicit
discourse relation recognition. Specifically, the
first algorithm achieved an absolute average f-
score improvement of 3% over a state of the art
baseline system.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the two algorithms for implicit
discourse relation recognition. Section 3 presents
experiments and results on PDTB data. Section
4 reviews related work. Section 5 concludes this
work.
2 Our Algorithms for Implicit Discourse
Relation Recognition
2.1 Prediction of implicit connectives
Explicit discourse relations are easily identifiable
due to the presence of discourse connectives be-
tween arguments. (Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b)
showed that in PDTB corpus, the most general
senses, i.e., Comparison (Comp.), Contingency
(Cont.), Temporal (Temp.) and Expansion (Exp.),
can be disambiguated in explicit relations with
more than 90% f-scores based only on discourse
connectives.
But for implicit relations, there are no connec-
tives to explicitly mark the relations, which makes
the recognition task quite difficult. PDTB data
provides implicit connectives that are inserted be-
tween paragraph-internal adjacent sentence pairs
not marked by any of explicit connectives. The
availability of ground-truth implicit connectives
makes it possible to evaluate the contribution of
these connectives for implicit relation recognition.
Our initial study on PDTB data show that the av-
erage f-score for the most general 4 senses can
reach 91.8% when we obtained the sense of each
test example by mapping each ground truth im-
plicit connective to its most frequent sense. We
see that connective information is an important
knowledge source for implicit relation recogni-
tion. However these implicit connectives do not
exist in real texts. In this paper we overcome this
difficulty by inserting a connective between two
arguments with the use of a language model.
Following the annotation scheme of PDTB, we
assume that each implicit connective takes two ar-
guments, denoted as Arg1 and Arg2. Typically,
there are two possible positions for most of im-
plicit connectives1, i.e., the position before Arg1
and the position between Arg1 and Arg2. Given a
set of possible implicit connectives {ci}, we gen-
erate two synthetic sentences, ci+Arg1+Arg2 and
Arg1+ci+Arg2 for each ci, denoted as Sci,1 and
Sci,2. Then we calculate the perplexity (an intrin-
sic score) of these sentences with the use of a lan-
guage model, denoted as PPL(Sci,j). According
1For parallel connectives, e.g., if . . . then. . . , the two con-
nectives will take the two arguments together, so there is only
one possible combination for connectives and arguments.
1508
to the value of PPL(Sci,j) (the lower the better),
we can rank these sentences and select the con-
nectives in top N sentences as implicit connec-
tives for this argument pair. The language model
may be trained on large amount of unannotated
corpora that can be cheaply acquired, e.g., North
American News corpus.
2.2 Using predicted implicit connectives as
additional features
We predict implicit connectives on both training
set and test set. Then we can use the predicted
implicit connectives as additional features for su-
pervised implicit relation recognition. Previous
works exploited various linguistically informed
features under the framework of supervised mod-
els. In this paper, we include 9 types of features
in our system due to their superior performance
in previous studies, e.g., polarity features, seman-
tic classes of verbs, contextual sense, modality,
inquirer tags of words, first-last words of argu-
ments, cross-argument word pairs, ever used in
(Pitler et al, 2009a), production rules of parse
trees of arguments used in (Lin et al, 2009), and
intra-argument word pairs inspired by the work of
(Saito et al, 2006).
Here we provide the details of the 9 features,
shown as follows:
Verbs: Similar to the work in (Pitler et al,
2009a), the verb features consist of the number of
pairs of verbs in Arg1 and Arg2 if they are from
the same class based on their highest Levin verb
class level (Dorr, 2001). In addition, the average
length of verb phrase and the part of speech tags
of main verb are also included as verb features.
Context: If the immediately preceding (or fol-
lowing) relation is an explicit, its relation and
sense are used as features. Moreover, we use an-
other feature to indicate if Arg1 leads a paragraph.
Polarity: We use the number of positive,
negated positive, negative and neutral words in ar-
guments and their cross product as features. For
negated positives, we locate the negated words in
text span and then define the closely behind posi-
tive word as negated positive.
Modality: We look for modal words including
their various tenses or abbreviation forms in both
arguments. Then we generate a feature to indicate
the presence or absence of modal words in both
arguments and their cross product.
Inquirer Tags: Inquirer Tags extracted from
General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al, 1966) con-
tains positive or negative classification of words.
In fact, its fine-grained categories, such as Fall
versus Rise, or Pleasure versus Pain, can indi-
cate the relation between two words, especially
for verbs. So we choose the presence or absence
of 21 pair categories with complementary relation
in Inquirer Tags as features. We also include their
cross production as features.
FirstLastFirst3: We choose the first and last
words of each argument as features, as well as the
pair of first words, the pair of last words, and the
first 3 words in each argument. In addition, we ap-
ply Porter?s Stemmer (Porter, 1980) to each word
before preparation of these features.
Production Rule: According to (Lin et al,
2009), we extract all the possible production rules
from arguments, and check whether the rules ap-
pear in Arg1, Arg2 and both arguments. We re-
move the rules occurring less than 5 times in train-
ing data.
Cross-argument Word Pairs: We perform the
Porter?s stemming (Porter, 1980), and then group
all words from Arg1 and Arg2 into two sets W1
and W2 respectively. Then we generate any possi-
ble word pair (wi, wj) (wi ? W1, wj ? W2). We
remove the word pairs with less than 5 times.
Intra-argument Word Pairs: Let
Q1 = (q1, q2, . . . , qn) be the word se-
quence of Arg1. The intra-argument word
pairs for Arg1 is defined as WP1 =
((q1, q2), (q1, q3), . . . , (q1, qn), (q2, q3), . . . ,
(qn?1, qn)). We extract all the intra-argument
word pairs from Arg1 and Arg2 and remove word
pairs appearing less than 5 times in training data.
2.3 Relation recognition based only on
predicted implicit connectives
After the prediction of implicit connectives, we
can address the implicit relation recognition task
with the methods for explicit relation recogni-
tion due to the presence of implicit connectives,
e.g., sense classification based only on connec-
tives (Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b). The work of
(Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b) showed that most
1509
of connectives are unambiguous and it is possible
to obtain high performance in prediction of dis-
course sense due to the simple mapping relation
between connectives and senses. Given two ex-
amples:
(E1) She paid less on her dress, but it is very nice.
(E2) We have to harry up because the raining is
getting heavier and heavier.
The two connectives, i.e., but in E1 and because
in E2, convey Comparison and Contingency sense
respectively. In most cases, we can easily recog-
nize the relation sense by the appearance of dis-
course connective since it can be interpreted in
only one way. That means, the ambiguity of the
mapping between sense and connective is quite
few.
We count the frequency of sense tags for each
possible connective on PDTB training data for im-
plicit relation. Then we build a sense recognition
model by simply mapping each connective to its
most frequent sense. Here we do not perform con-
nective prediction on training data. During test-
ing, we use the language model to insert implicit
connectives into each test argument pair. Then we
perform relation recognition by mapping each im-
plicit connective to its most frequent sense.
3 Experiments and Results
3.1 Experiments
3.1.1 Data sets
In this work we used the PDTB 2.0 corpus for
evaluation of our algorithms. Following the work
of (Pitler et al, 2009a), we used sections 2-20 as
training set, sections 21-22 as test set, and sec-
tions 0-1 as development set for parameter opti-
mization. For comparison with the work of (Pitler
et al, 2009a), we ran four binary classification
tasks to identify each of the main relations (Cont.,
Comp., Exp., and Temp.) from the rest. For each
relation, we used equal numbers of positive and
negative examples as training data2. The negative
examples were chosen at random from sections 2-
20. We used all the instances in sections 21 and
22 as test set, so the test set is representative of

pansion relation are different from those in (Pitler et al,
2009a). The reason is that we do not include instances of
EntRel as positive examples.
the natural distribution. The numbers of positive
and negative instances for each sense in different
data sets are listed in Table 1.

In this work we used LibSVM toolkit to con-
struct four linear SVM models for a baseline sys-
tem and the system in Section 2.2.
3.1.2 A baseline system
We first built a baseline system, which used 9
types of features listed in Section 2.2.
We tuned the numbers of firstLastFirst3, cross-
argument word pair, intra-argument word pair on
development set. Finally we set the frequency
threshold at 3, 5 and 5 respectively.
3.1.3 Prediction of implicit connectives
To predict implicit connectives, we adopt the
following two steps:(1) train a language model;
(2) select top N implicit connectives.
Step 1: We used SRILM toolkit to train the lan-
guage models on three benchmark news corpora,
i.e., New York part in the BLLIP North Ameri-
can News, Xin and Ltw parts of English Gigaword
(4th Edition). We also tried different values for
n in n-gram model. The parameters were tuned
on the development set to optimize the accuracy
of prediction. In this work we chose 3-gram lan-
guage model trained on NY corpus.
Step 2: We combined each instance?s Arg1 and
Arg2 with connectives extract from PDTB2 (100
in all). There are two types of connectives, sin-
gle connective (e.g. because and but) and paral-
lel connective (such as ?not only . . . , but also?).
Since discourse connectives may appear not only
ahead of the Arg1, but also between Arg1 and
Arg2, we considered this case. Given a set of pos-
sible implicit connectives {ci}, for single connec-
tive {ci}, we constructed two synthetic sentences,
ci+Arg1+Arg2 and Arg1+ci+Arg2. In case of
1510
parallel connective, we constructed one synthetic
sentence like ci1+Arg1+ci2+Arg2.
As a result, we can get 198 synthetic sentences
for each argument pair. Then we converted all
words to lower cases and used the language model
trained in the above step to calculate perplexity
on sentence level. The perplexity scores were
ranked from low to high. For example, we got the
perplexity (ppl) for two sentences as follows:
(1) but this is an old story, we?re talking about
years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having
any questionable properties.
ppl= 652.837
(2) this is an old story, but we?re talking about
years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having
any questionable properties.
ppl= 583.514
We considered the combination of connectives
and their position as final features like mid but,
first but, where the features are binary, that is, the
presence and absence of the specific connective.
According to the value of PPL(Sci,j) (the
lower the better), we selected the connectives in
top N sentences as implicit connectives for this
argument pair. In order to get the optimal N value,
we tried various values of N on development set
and selected the minimum value of N so that the
ground-truth connectives appeared in top N con-
nectives. The final N value is set to 60 based on
the trade-off between performance and efficiency.
3.1.4 Using predicted connectives as
additional features
This system combines the predicted implicit
connectives as additional features and the 9 types
of features in an supervised framework. The 9
types of features are listed as shown in Section 2.2
and tuned on development set.
We combined predicted connectives with the
best subset features from the development data set
with respect to f-score. In our experiment of se-
lecting best subset features, single features rather
than the combination of several features achieved
much higher scores. So we combine single fea-
tures with predicted connectives as final features.
3.1.5 Using only predicted connectives for
implicit relation recognition
We built two variants for the algorithm in Sec-
tion 2.3. One is to use the data for explicit re-
lations in PDTB sections 2-20 as training data.
The other is to use the data for implicit relations
in PDTB sections 2-20 as training data. Given
training data, we obtained the most frequent sense
for each connective appearing in the training data.
Then given test data, we recognized the sense of
each argument pair by mapping each predicted
connective to its most frequent sense. In this
work we conducted another experiment to see the
upper-bound performance of this algorithm. Here
we performed recognition based on ground-truth
implicit connectives and used the data for implicit
relations as training data.
3.2 Results
3.2.1 Result of baseline system
Table 2 summarizes the best performance
achieved by the baseline system in compari-
son with previous state-of-the-art performance
achieved in (Pitler et al, 2009a). The first two
lines in the table show their best results using sin-
gle feature and using combined feature subset. It
indicates that the performance of using combined
feature subset is higher than that using single fea-
ture alone.
From this table, we can find that our base-
line system has a comparable result on Contin-
gency and Temporal. On Comparison, our system
achieved a better performance around 9% f-score
higher than their best result. However, for Expan-
sion, they expanded both training and testing sets
by including EntRel relation as positive examples,
which makes it impossible to perform direct com-
parison. Generally, our baseline system is reason-
able and thus the consequent experiments on it are
reliable.

From this table, we found that this additional
feature obtained from language model showed
significant improvements in almost four relations.
Specifically, the top two improvements are on Ex-
pansion and Temporal relations, which improved
4.16% and 3.84% in f-score respectively. Al-
though on Comparison relation there is only a
slight improvement (+1.07%), our two best sys-
tems both got around 10% improvements of f-
score over a state-of-the-art system in (Pitler et al,
2009a). As a whole, the first algorithm achieved
3% improvement of f-score over a state of the art
baseline system. All these results indicate that
predicted implicit connectives can help improve
the performance.
3.2.3 Result of algorithm 2: using only
predicted connectives for implicit
relation recognition
Table 4 summarizes the best performance
achieved by the second algorithm in comparison
with the baseline system on test set.
The experiment showed that the baseline sys-
tem using just gold-truth implicit connectives can
achieve an f-score of 91.8% for implicit relation
recognition. It once again proved that implicit
connectives make significant contributions for im-
plicit relation recognition. This also encourages
our future work on finding the most suitable con-
nectives for implicit relation recognition.
From this table, we found that, using only pre-
dicted implicit connectives achieved an compara-
ble performance to (Pitler et al, 2009a), although
it was still a bit lower than our best baseline. But
we should bear in mind that this algorithm only
uses 4 features for implicit relation recognition
and these 4 features are easy computable and fast
run, which makes the system more practical in ap-
plication. Furthermore, compared with other al-
gorithms which require hand-annotated data for
training, the performance of this second algorithm
is acceptable if we take into account that no la-
beled data is used for model training.
3.3 Analysis
Experimental results on PDTB showed that using
the predicted implicit connectives significantly
improves the performance of implicit discourse
relation recognition. Our first algorithm achieves
an average f-score improvement of 3% over a
state of the art baseline system. Specifically, for
the relations: Comp., Cont., Exp., Temp., our
first algorithm can achieve 1.07%, 1.78%, 4.16%,
3.84% f-score improvements over a state of the
art baseline system. Since (Pitler et al, 2009a)

sion sense3, we cannot make a direct compari-
son. However, we achieve the best f-score around
70%, which provide 5% improvements over our
baseline system. On the other hand, the second
proposed algorithm using only predicted connec-
tives still achieves promising results for each rela-
tion. Specifically, the model for the Comparison
relation achieves an f-score of 26.02% (5% over
the previous work in (Pitler et al, 2009a)). Fur-
thermore, the models for Contingency and Tem-
poral relation achieve 35.72% and 13.76% f-score
respectively, which are comparable to the previ-
ous work in (Pitler et al, 2009a). The model for
Expansion relation obtains an f-score of 64.95%,
which is only 1% less than our baseline system
which consists of ten thousands of features.
4 Related Work
Existing works on automatic recognition of dis-
course relations can be grouped into two cat-
egories according to whether they used hand-
annotated corpora.
One research line is to perform relation recog-
nition without hand-annotated corpora.
(Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) used a pattern-
based approach to extract instances of discourse
relations such as Contrast and Elaboration from
unlabeled corpora. Then they used word-pairs be-
tween two arguments as features for building clas-
sification models and tested their model on artifi-
cial data for implicit relations.
There are other efforts that attempt to extend the
work of (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). (Saito et al,
2006) followed the method of (Marcu and Echi-
habi, 2002) and conducted experiments with com-
bination of cross-argument word pairs and phrasal

domly selected EntRel instances by 50%, which is consid-
ered to significantly change data distribution.
patterns as features to recognize implicit relations
between adjacent sentences in a Japanese corpus.
They showed that phrasal patterns extracted from
a text span pair provide useful evidence in the re-
lation classification. (Sporleder and Lascarides,
2008) discovered that Marcu and Echihabi?s mod-
els do not perform as well on implicit relations as
one might expect from the test accuracies on syn-
thetic data. (Blair-Goldensohn, 2007) extended
the work of (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002) by re-
fining the training and classification process using
parameter optimization, topic segmentation and
syntactic parsing.
(Lapata and Lascarides, 2004) dealt with tem-
poral links between main and subordinate clauses
by inferring the temporal markers linking them.
They extracted clause pairs with explicit temporal
markers from BLLIP corpus as training data.
Another research line is to use human-
annotated corpora as training data, e.g., the RST
Bank (Carlson et al, 2001) used by (Soricut and
Marcu, 2003), adhoc annotations used by (?),
(Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005), and the Graph-
Bank (Wolf et al, 2005) used by (Wellner et al,
2006).
Recently the release of the Penn Discourse
TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al, 2008) bene-
fits the researchers with a large discourse anno-
tated corpora, using a comprehensive scheme for
both implicit and explicit relations. (Pitler et al,
2009a) performed implicit relation classification
on the second version of the PDTB. They used
several linguistically informed features, such as
word polarity, verb classes, and word pairs, show-
ing performance increases over a random classi-
fication baseline. (Lin et al, 2009) presented an
implicit discourse relation classifier in PDTB with
the use of contextual relations, constituent Parse
Features, dependency parse features and cross-
argument word pairs.

In comparison with existing works, we investi-
gated a new knowledge source, implicit connec-
tives, for implicit relation recognition. Moreover,
our two models can exploit both labeled and un-
labeled data by training a language model on un-
labeled data and then using this language model
to generate implicit connectives for recognition
models trained on labeled data.
5 Conclusions
In this paper we use a language model to auto-
matically generate implicit connectives and then
present two methods to use these connectives for
recognition of implicit relations. One method is to
use these predicted implicit connectives as addi-
tional features in a supervised model and the other
is to perform implicit relation recognition based
only on these predicted connectives. Results on
Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 show that predicted
discourse connectives help implicit relation recog-
nition and the first algorithm achieves an absolute
average f-score improvement of 3% over a state of
the art baseline system.
