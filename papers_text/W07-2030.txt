Abstract 
Entity disambiguation resolves the many-
to-many correspondence between mentions 
of entities in text and unique real-world en-
tities.  Fair Isaac?s entity disambiguation 
uses language-independent entity context 
to agglomeratively resolve mentions with 
similar names to unique entities.  This pa-
per describes Fair Isaac?s automatic entity 
disambiguation capability and assesses its 
performance on the SemEval 2007 Web 
People Search task. 
1 Introduction 
We use the term entity to mean a specific person or 
object.  A mention is a reference to an entity such 
as a word or phrase in a document.  Taken to-
gether, all mentions that refer to the same real-
world object model that entity (Mitchell et al 
2004).  Entity disambiguation inherently involves 
resolving many-to-many relationships.  Multiple 
distinct strings may refer to the same entity.  Si-
multaneously, multiple identical mentions refer to 
distinct entities (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998). 
Fair Isaac?s entity disambiguation software is 
based largely on language-independent algorithms 
that resolve mentions in the context of the entire 
corpus.  The system utilizes multiple types of con-
text as evidence for determining whether two men-
tions correspond to the same entity and it auto-
matically learns the weight of evidence of each 
context item via corpus statistics. 
The goal of the Web People Search task (Artiles 
et al 2007) is to assign Web pages to groups, 
where each group contains all (and only those) 
pages that refer to one unique entity.  A page is 
assigned to multiple groups if it mentions multiple 
entities, for example ?John F. Kennedy? and the 
?John F. Kennedy Library?.  The pages were se-
lected via a set of keyword queries, and the disam-
biguation is evaluated only on those query entities.  
This differs from Fair Isaac?s system in a few key 
ways: our system deals with mentions rather than 
documents, our system does not require a filter on 
mentions, and our system is generally used for 
large collections of documents containing very 
many names rather than small sets of highly am-
biguous documents dealing with one specific 
name.  Nevertheless, it was possible to run the Fair 
Isaac entity disambiguation system on the Web 
People Search task data with almost no modifica-
tions and achieve accurate results. 
The remaining sections of this paper describe 
Fair Isaac?s automatic entity disambiguation meth-
odology and report on the performance of the sys-
tem on the WePS data. 
2 Methodology 
In unstructured text, each document provides a 
natural context for entity disambiguation.  After 
cleaning up extraneous markup we carry out 
within-document co-reference resolution, aggregat-
ing information about each entity mentioned in 
each document.  We then use these entity attributes 
as features in determining which documents deal 
with the same entity. 
2.1 Dealing with Raw Web Data 
The first challenge in dealing with data from the 
Web is to decide which documents are useful and 
149
what text from those documents contains relevant 
information.  As a first pass, the first HTML file in 
a folder which contained the query name was used 
as the main page.  In retrospect, it might have been 
better to combine all portions of the page, or 
choose the longest page.  We copied the title ele-
ment and converted all text chunks to paragraphs, 
eliminating all other HTML and script.  If no 
HTML was found in the directory for a page, the 
first text file which contained the query was used 
instead. 
2.2 Within-Document Disambiguation 
When dealing with unstructured text, a named en-
tity recognition (NER) system provides the input to 
the entity disambiguation.  Due to time constraints 
and that Persons are the entity type of primary in-
terest, any mention that matches one of the query 
strings is automatically labeled as a Person, regard-
less of its actual type. 
As described in Blume (2005), the system next 
carries out entity type-specific parsing in order to 
extract entity attributes such as titles, generate 
standardized names (e.g. p_abdul_khan_p for ?Dr. 
Abdul Q. Khan?), and populate the data structures 
(token hashes) that are used to perform the within-
document entity disambiguation.   
We err on the side of not merging entities rather 
than incorrectly merging entities.  Looking at mul-
tiple documents provides additional statistics.  
Thus, the cross-document disambiguation process 
described in the next section will still merge some 
entities even within individual documents. 
2.3 Cross-Document Disambiguation 
Our cross-document entity disambiguation relies 
on one key insight: an entity can be distinguished 
by the company it keeps.  If Abdul Khan 1 associ-
ates with different people and organizations at dif-
ferent locations than Abdul Khan 2, then he is 
probably a different person.  Furthermore, if it is 
possible to compare two entities based on one type 
of context, it is possible to compare them based on 
every type of context. 
Within each domain, we require a finite set of 
context items.  In the domains of co-occurring lo-
cations, organizations, and persons, these are the 
standardized names derived in the entity informa-
tion extraction phase of within-document disam-
biguation.  We use the logarithm of the inverse 
name frequency (the number of standard person 
names with which this context item appears), INF, 
as a weight indicating the salience of each context 
item.  Co-occurrence with a common name pro-
vides less indication that two mentions correspond 
to the same entity than co-occurrence with an un-
common name.  To reduce noise, only entities that 
occur within a given window of entities are in-
cluded in this vector.  In all test runs, this window 
is set to 10 entities on either side.  Because of the 
effects that small corpora have on statistics, we 
added a large amount of newswire text to improve 
frequency counts.  Many of the query names would 
have low frequency in a text corpus that is not 
about them specifically, but have high frequency in 
this task because each document contains at least 
one mention of them.  This would cause the INF 
weight to incorrectly estimate the importance of 
any token; adding additional documents to the dis-
ambiguation run reduces this effect and brings fre-
quency counts to more realistic levels. 
We similarly count title tokens that occur with 
the entity and compute INF weights for the title 
tokens.  Topic context, as described in Blume 
(2005), was used in some post-submission runs. 
We define a separate distance measure per con-
text domain.  We are able to discount the co-
occurrence with multiple items as well as quantify 
an unexpected lack of shared co-occurrence by 
engineering each distance measure for each spe-
cific domain.  The score produced by each distance 
measure may be loosely interpreted as the log of 
the likelihood of two randomly generated contexts 
sharing the observed degree of similarity. 
In addition to the context-based distance meas-
ures, we utilize a lexical (string) distance measure 
based on exactly the same transformations as used 
to compare strings for intra-document entity dis-
ambiguation plus the Soundex algorithm (Knuth 
1998) to measure whether two name tokens sound 
the same.  A large negative score indicates a great 
deal of similarity (log likelihood). 
The process of cross-document entity disam-
biguation now boils down to repeatedly finding a 
pair of entities, comparing them (computing the 
sum of the above distance measures), and merging 
them if the score exceeds some threshold.  We 
compute sets of keys based on lexical similarity 
and compare only entities that are likely to match.  
The WePS evaluation only deals with entities that 
match a query.  Thus, we added a new step of key 
generation based on the query.

3 Performance 
We have tested our entity disambiguation system 
on several semi-structured and unstructured text 
data sets.  Here, we report the performance on the 
training data provided for the Web People Search 
task.  This corpus consists of raw Web pages with 
substantial variation in capitalization, punctuation, 
grammar, and spelling ? characteristics that make 
NER challenging.  A few other issues also nega-
tively impact our performance, including extrane-
ous text, long lists of entities, and the issue of find-
ing the correct document to parse. 
The NER process identified a ratio of approxi-
mately 220 mentions per document across 3,359 
documents.  Within-document entity disambigua-
tion reduced this to approximately 113 entities per 
document, which we refer to as document-level 
entities.  Of these, 3,383 Persons (including those 
Organizations and Locations which were relabeled 
as Persons) contained a query name.  Cross-
document entity disambiguation reduced this to 
976 distinct persons with 721 distinct standardized 
names.  Thus, 2,407 merge operations were per-
formed in this step.  On average, there are 48 men-
tions per query name.   Our system found an aver-
age of 14 unique entities per query name.  In the 
gold standard, the average is 9 unique entities per 
query name. 
Looking at the names that matched in the out-
put, it is clear that NER is very important to the 
process.  Post submission of our initial run, we 
used proper tokenization of punctuation and an 
additional NER system, which corrected many 
mistakes in the grouping of names.  Also, many of 
the names that were incorrectly merged would not 
have been compared if not for the introduction of 
the additional key that compares all mentions that 
match a query name.  
For the WePS evaluation submission, we con-
verted our results to document-level entities by 
mapping each mention to the document that it was 
part of and removing duplicates.  If we did not find 
a mention in a document, we labeled the document 
as a singleton entity. 
We also used a number of standard metrics for 
our internal evaluation.  Most of these operate on 
document-level entities rather than on documents.  
To convert the ground truth provided for the task 
to a form usable for these metrics, we assume that 
each entity contains all mentions in the corre-
sponding document group.  These metrics test the 
cross-document disambiguation rather than the 
NER and within-document disambiguation.  These 
metrics should not be used to compare between 
different versions of NER and within-document 
disambiguation, since the ground truth used in the 
evaluation is generated by these processes.   
In Table 1, we compare a run with the additional 
newswire data and the comparison key (our WePS 
submission), leaving out the additional newswire 
data and the additional comparison key, and leav-
ing out only the additional comparison key. 
In Table 2, we compare runs based on the im-
proved NER (available only after the WePS sub-
mission deadline).  The first uses the same parame-
ters as our submission, the second uses an in-
creased threshold, and the third utilizes the word 
vector-based clustering (document topics).

Table 2. Results based on improved named entity 
recognition.  These should not be directly com-
pared against those in Table 1, since the different 
NER yields different ground truth for these evalua-
tion metrics. 
Most of our metrics are based on pairwise com-
parisons ? all document-level entities are compared 
against all other document-level entities that match 
the same query name, noting whether the pair was 
coreferent in the results and in the ground truth.  
With such comparison, we obtain measures includ-
ing precision, recall, and accuracy.  In this training 
data, depending on which NER is used, 35,000-
50,000 pairwise comparisons are possible.   
We also define a clusterwise measure of the 
harmonic mean between purity and inverse purity 
with respect to mentions.  This is different from the 
metric provided by WePS, purity and inverse pu-
151
rity at the document level.  Since some documents 
contain multiple entities, the latter metric does not 
perform correctly.  Mentions, on the other hand, 
are always unique in our disambiguation.  How-
ever, because the ground truth was specified at the 
document level, documents containing multiple 
entities that match a query yield ambiguous men-
tions.  These decrease all purity-related scores 
equally and do not vary between runs.   
The addition of the newswire data improved re-
sults.  Inclusion of an extra comparison based on 
query name matches allowed for comparison of 
entities with names that do not match the format of 
person names, and only slightly reduced overall 
performance.  The new NER run can only be com-
pared on the last three runs.  to the system per-
forms better with topic context than without it. 
In comparison, in the 2005 Knowledge Discov-
ery and Dissemination (KD-D) Challenge Task 
ER-1a (the main entity disambiguation task), we 
achieved an accuracy of 94.5%.  The margin of 
error in the evaluation was estimated at 3% due to 
errors in the ?ground truth?.  This was a pure dis-
ambiguation task with no NER or name standardi-
zation required.  The evaluation set contained 100 
names, 9027 documents, and 583,152 pair-wise 
assertions. 
4 Conclusions 
Although the primary purposes of Fair Isaac?s en-
tity disambiguation system differ from the goal of 
the Web People Search task, we found that with 
little modification it was possible to fairly accu-
rately cluster Web pages with a given query name 
according to the real-world entities mentioned on 
the page.  Most of the errors that we encountered 
are related to information extraction from unstruc-
tured data as opposed to the cross-document entity 
disambiguation itself.
