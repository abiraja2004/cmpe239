ABSTRACT 
The paper presents an a lgor i thm, wr i t ten  in 
PROLOG, for process ing Engl ish sentences which 
contain either Gapping, Right Node Rais ing (RNR) 
or Reduced Conjunct ion (RC). The DCG (Definite 
Clause Grammar) formalism (Pereira & Warren 80) is 
adopted. The algorithm is h ighly ef f ic ient  and 
capable of process ing a full range of coord inate  
constructions containing any number of coordinate 
con junct ions  ('and', 'or', and 'but'). The 
algorithm is part of an English-Chinese machine 
t rans lat ion system which is in the course of 
construction. 
0 INTRODUCTION 
Theoret i ca l  l ingu is ts  have  made a 
cons iderab le  invest igat ion  into  coord inate  
construct ions (Ross 67a, Hankamer  73, Schachter  
77, Sag 77, Gazdar 81 and Sobin 82, to name a 
few), giving descr ipt ions of the phenomena from 
various perspectives. Some of the descriptions are 
s t imu la t ing  or conv inc ing .  Computat iona l  
l inguists, on the other hand, have achieved less 
than their theoretical counterparts. 
(Woods 73)'s SYSCONJ, to my knowledge, is the 
first and the most often referenced fac i l i ty  
designed specifically for coordinate construction 
processing. It can get the correct analysis  for 
RC sentences like 
(i) J ohn  drove  his car th rough and 
completely demolished a plate glass window 
but only after trying and fai l ing an indef in i te  
number  of t imes ,  due to its h igh ly  non-  
deterministic nature. 
(Church 79) claims '~ome impressive initial 
progress" process ing conjunct ions with his NL 
parser YAP. Using a Marcus-type attention shift 
mechan ism,  YAP can parse  many con junct ion  
construct ions including some cases of Gapping. 
It doesn' t  o f fe r  a complete  so lu t ion  to 
con junct ion  process ing  though:  the Gapp ing  
sentences YAP deals with are only those wlth two 
NP remnants in a Gapped conjunct.

(McCord 80) proposes a "more straightforward 
and more contro l lable"  way of pars ing sentences 
like (I) w i th in  a Slot Grammar  f ramework.  He 
treats "drove his car through and complete ly  
demolished" as a conjoined VP, which doesn't seem 
quite valid. 
(Boguraev 83) suggests that when "and" is 
encountered ,  a new ATN arc be dynamlca l ly  
constructed which seeks to recognise a right hand 
constituent categorlally similar to the left hand 
one just completed or being currently processed. 
The problem is that the left-hand conjunct may not 
be the current or most recent constituent hut the 
constituent of which that former one is a part. 
(Berwlck  83) parses  successfu l ly  Gapped 
sentences like 
(2) Max gave Sally a nickel yesterday, and a 
dime today 
us ing  an extended Marcus - type  determin is t i c  
parser. It is not clear, though, how his parser 
would treat RC sentences llke (I) where the f i~t  
conjunct is not a complete clause. 
The present work attacks the coordinate 
construction problem along the lines of DCG. Its 
coverage is wider than the existing systems: both 
Gapping, RNR and RC, as wel l  as ord inary  cases of 
coord inate  sentences ,  a re  taken  in to  
consideration. The work is a major development of 
(Huang 83)'s CASSEX package, which in turn was 
based on (Boguraev 79)'s work, a system for 
resolv ing l ingu is t ic  ambiguit ies  which combined 
ATN grammars (Woods 73) and Preference Semantics 
(Wi lks 75). 
In the first section of the paper, problems 
raised for Natural Language Processing by Gapping, 
RNR and RC are invest igated. Sect ion 2 gives a 
grouping of sentences conta in ing  coord inate  
conjunctions. Finally, the algorithm is described 
in Sect ion 3. 
I GAPPING, RIGHT NODE RAISING AND 
REDUCED CONJUNCTION 
I.I Gapping 
Gapping is the case where the verb or the 
verb together with some other e lements  in the 
non-leftmost conjuncts is deleted from a sentence: 
(3) Bob saw Bill and Sue \[saw\] Mary. 
243 
(4) Max wants to try to begin to wr i te  a 
novel, and Alex \[wants to try to begin to write\] a 
play. 
Linguists have described rules for generating 
Gapping, though none of them has made any effort 
to formulate  a rule for detect ing Gapping. (Ross 
67b) is the first who suggested a rule for 
Gapping. The fo rmal i sa t ion  of the rule is due to 
(Hankamer 73): 
Gap pl ng 
NP X A Z and NP X B Z --> NP X A Z and NP B 
where  A and  B are  non ident ica l  ma jor  
constituents*. 
(Sag 76) pointed out that there were cases 
where the left per ipheral  in the right conjunct 
might be a non-NP, as in 
(5) At our house, we play poker, and at 
Betsy's house, bridge. 
It should be noted that the two NPs in the 
Gapping rule must not be the same, o therwise  (7) 
would be derived from (6): 
(6) Bob saw Bill and Bob saw Mary. 
(7) Bob saw Bill and Bob Mary. 
whereas people actually say 
(8) Bob saw Bill and Mary. 
When processing (8), we treat it as a simplex 
containing a compound object ("Bill and Mary") 
funct ioning as a unit ("unit interpretation"),  
a l though as a rule we treat sentence conta in ing 
con junct ion  as der ived  f rom a "complex" ,  a 
sentence cons ist ing of more than one clause, in 
this case "Bob saw Bi l l  and Bob saw Mary"  
("sentence coord inat ion interpretation").  The 
reason for analys ing (8) as a s implex is first, 
fo r  the purpose  of t rans la t ion ,  un i t  
interpretation is adequate (the ambiguity, if any, 
wi l l  be "transferred" to the target language); 
secondly, it is easier to process. 
Another  fact worth not ic ing is that in the 
above Gapping rule, B in the second conjunct could 
be anything, but not empty. E.g., the (a)s in the 
following sentences are Gapping examples, but the 
(b)s are not: 
(9) (a) Max spoke f luently, and Albert  
haltingly. 
*(b) Max spoke fluently, and Albert. 
(I0) (a) Max wrote a novel, and Alex a 
play. 
*(b) Max wrote a novel, and Alex. 
(II) (a) Bob saw Bill, and Sue Mary. 
(b) Bob saw Bill, and Sue. 
Before trying to draw a rule for detect ing 
* According to the dependency grammar we adopt, we 
define a major const i tuent of a given sentence S 
as a constituent immediately dominated by the main 
verb of S. 
Gapping, we will observe the difference between 
(12) and (13) on one hand, and (14) on the other: 
(12) Bob met Sue and Mar k in London. 
(13) I knew the man w i th  the telescope 
and the woman with the umbrella. 
(14) Bob met Sue in Paris and Mary in London. 
As we stated above, (12) is not a case of Gapping; 
instead, we take "Sue and Mary" as a coord inate  
NP. Nor is (13) a case of Gapping. (14), however,  
cannot be treated as phrasal coordination because 
the PP in the left con junct  ("in Par is" )  is 
directly dominated by the main verb so that "Mary" 
is prevented from being conjoined to "Sue". 
Now, the Gapping Detecting Rule: 
The structure "NPI V A X and NP2 B" where the 
left conjunct is a complete  clause, A and B are 
major  const i tuents ,  and X is e i ther  NIL  or 
a const i tuent  not dominated  by A, is a case of 
Gapping if (OR (AND (X = NIL) (B = NP)) 
(AND (V = 3-valency verb)* 
(OR (B = NP) (B = to NP))) 
(AND (X /= NP) (X /= NIL)))** 
1.2 Right Node Raising (RNR) 
RNR is the case where the object in the non- 
rightmost conjunct is missing. 
(15) John struck and kicked the boy. 
(16) Bob looked at and Bill took the jar. 
RNR raises less serious problems than Gapping 
does. All we need to do is to parse the right 
conjunct  first, then copy the object over to the 
left conjunct so that a representat ion for the 
left clause can be constructed. Then we combine  
the two to get a representation for the sentence. 
Sentences  l lke the fo l low ing  may raise 
difficulty for parsing: 
(17) I ate and you drank everything they 
brought. (cf. Church 79) 
(17) can be analysed either as a complex  of two 
full clauses, or RNR, according to whether  we 
treat '~te" as transitive or intransitive. 
1.3 Reduced Conjunction 
Reduced Conjunct ion is the case where the 
conjoined surface str ings are not we l l - fo rmed 
constituents as in 
(18) John drove his car through and completely 
demolished a plate glass window. 
where the conjoined surface strings "drove his car 
through" and "completely demolished" are not well- 
formed constituents. The problem will not be as 
* 3-valency verbs are those which can appear  in 
the s t ruc ture  "NP V NP NP', such as "give', 
"name', "select', 'call', etc. 
** Here "/=" means "is not". 
244 
ser ious as might  have seemed, given our 
understanding of Gapping and RNR. After we 
process the left conjunct, we know that an 
object is still needed (assuming that "through" is 
a preposi t ion) .  Then we parse the right 
conjunct, copying over the subject from the left; 
f inal ly,  we copy the object from the r ight 
conjunct to the left to complete the left clause. 
II GROUPING OF SENTENCES CONTAINING CONJUNCTIONS 
We can sort sentences containing conjunctions 
into three major groups on the basis of the nature 
of the left-most conjunct: Group A contains 
sentences whose left-most conjuncts are recognized 
by the analyser as complete clauses; Group B, the 
left-most conjuncts are not complete clauses, but 
contain verbs; and Group C, all the other cases. 
The following is a detailed grouping with example 
sentences: 
AI. (Gapping) Clause-lnternal ellipsis: 
(19) I played football and John tennis. 
(20) Bob met Sue in Paris and John Mary in 
London. 
(21) Max spoke f luent ly  and Albert  
haltingly. 
A2. (Capping) Left-peripheral ellipsis wlth two 
NP remnants: 
(22) Max gave a nickel to Sally and a dime 
to Harvey. 
(23) Max gave Sally a nickel and Harvey a 
dime. 
(24) Jack calls Joe Mike and Sam Harry. 
A3. (Gapping)Left-perlpheral ellipsis with one NP 
remnant and some non-NP remnant(s): 
(25) Bob met Sue in Paris and Mary In 
London. 
(26) John played football yesterday and 
tennis today. 
A4. (Gapp ing)  R ight -per lphera l  e l l ips is  
concomitant with clause-internal elllpsls: 
(27) Jack begged Elsie to get married and 
Wilfred Phoebe. 
(2~) John persuaded Dr. Thomas to examine 
Mary, and Bill Dr. Jones. 
(29) Betsy talked to Bill on Sunday, and 
Alan to Sandy. 
A5. The right conjunct is a complete clause: 
(30) I played football and John watched the 
television. 
A6. The right conjunct is a verb phrase to be 
treated as a clause with the subject deleted: 
(31) The man kicked the child and threw the 
ball. 
AT. Sentences where the "unit interpretation" 
should be taken: 
(32) Bob met Sue and Mary in London. 
(33) I knew the glrl bitten by the dog and 
the cat. 
BI. Right Node Raising: 
(34) The man kicked and threw the ball. 
(35) The man kicked and the woman threw the 
ba I 1. 
B2. Reduced Conjunction: 
(36) John drove hls car through and 
completely demolished a plate glass 
window. 
C. Unlt interpretations: 
(37) The man with the telescope and the woman 
with the umbrella kicked the ball. 
(38) Slowly and stealthily, he crept towards 
his victim. 
III THE ALGORITHM 
The following algorithm, implemented in 
PROLOG Version 3.3 (shown here in much abridged 
form), produces correct syntact l co -semant ic  
representations for all the sentences given in 
Section 2. We show here some of the essential 
c lauses*  of the a lgor i thm:  "sentence ' ,  
"rest sentencel" and "sentence conjunction'. The 
top -most  c lause "sentence" parses sentences 
consisting of one or more conjuncts. In the body 
of "sentence', we have as sub-goa ls  the 
disjunction of "noun_phrase" and 'noun phrasel', 
for getting the sentence subject; the disjunction 
of "\[W\], Is verb" and 'verbl', plus 'rest verb', 
for t reat ing the verb of the sentence;  the 
d i s junct ion  of 'rest sentence" and "rest 
sentence1" for handling The object, preposltlonaT 
phrases, etc; and finally "sentence conJunctlon', 
for handling coordinate conjunctlon~ 
The Gapping, RNR and RC sentences In Section 
II contain deletions from either left or right 
conjuncts or both. Deleted subjects in right 
conjuncts are handled by 'noun phrasel' in our 
program; deleted verbs in right conjuncts by 
'verbl'. The most difficult deletions to handle 
(for previous systems) are those from the left 
conjuncts, ie. the deleted objects of RNR (Group 
BI) and the deleted preposition objects of RC 
(Group B2), because when the left conJuncts are 
being parsed, the deleted parts are not avallabl~ 
This is dealt with neatly in PROLOG DCG by using 
logical variables which stand for the deleted 
parts, are "holes" In the structures built, and 
get filled later by unif ication as the parsing 
proceeds.

For sentence (36) ("John drove his car 
through and completely demolished a plate glass 
window"), for instance, when parsing the left 
conjunct, "rest sentencel" will be called event- 
ually. The follo~ing verb structure will be built: 
v(drovel ,agent(np(pronoun(John))), object(np(det 
(his), pre mod(\[\]), n(carl), post mods(\[\]))), post 
verbmods~prep mods ( prep ( through~, pre~obJ (P rep  
Obj)), where th\[ logical variable PrepObJ will be 
unified later with the argument standing for the 
object in the right conjunct (ie, "a plate glass 
window"). When 'sentence" is called via the sub- 
goal 'sentence_conjunctlon" to process the right 
conjunct, the deleted subject "John" will be 
copied over via "noun phrasel'. F inal ly a 
structure is built which i-s a combination of two 
complete clauses. During the processing little 
effort is wasted. The backward deleted consti- 
tuents ("a plate glass window" here) are recovered 
by using logical variables; the forward deleted 
ones ("John" here) by passing over values (via 
unification) from the conjunct already processed. 
Moreover, the "try-and-fail" procedure is carried 
out in a controlled and intelligent way. Thus a 
high efficiency lacking in many other systems is 
achieved (space prevents us from providing a 
detailed discussion of this issue here).
