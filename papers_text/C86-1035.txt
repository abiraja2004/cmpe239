In this paper wc will describe an approach to parsing one major 
component of which is a stragegy called RECONNAISSANCE- 
ATTACK. Under this strategy, no structure building is attempted 
until after completion of a preliminary phase designed to exploit 
low-level information to the fullest possible xtent. This first pass 
then defines a set of constraints that restrict he set of available 
options when structure building proper begins. R-A parsing is in 
principle compatible with a variety of different views regarding the 
nature of syntactic representation, though it fits more comfortably 
with some than with others--a point to which we shall return. 
Three pr inc ip les which are closely al l ied with 
Reconnaissance--Attack are MULTIPLE OPTIONS, GRADED ATFACK 
and ALTRUISM AVOIDANCE. The principle of Multiple Options 
states that a variety of techniques for solving particular problems 
should be available, ranging from simple and constrained to 
complex and powerful. The underlying idea is that while it might 
be demonstrable that certain tasks lie beyond the capabilities of, 
say, a local pattern matcher, the pattern matcher might suffice 
often enough to warrant its retention for the cases where it is 
effective. The corollary principle of Graded Attack states that 
more powerful weapons should be called up only after less 
powerful ones have failed. Finally, the principle of Almfism 
'Avoidance states (in its strongest form) that no computational 
effort should be undertaken without the guarantee of a payoff. 
Limitations of space preclude adetailed treatment of the first two 
here (see Rindflesch forthcoming), though the third is implicit in 
the approach to specific examples to be mentioned later" on. 
The extent to which these ideas are valid may vary across 
applications. In psychological modelling it may prove undesirable 
to exploit them fully given the existence of phenomena ('garden 
path effects') which suggest that in human linguistic processing, 
attack is sometimes premature or based on faulty reconnaissance. 
On the other hand, the principles we have describexl have attractive 
properties in the context of purely practical goals. 
It is widely agreed that a satisfactory approach to parsing nmst 
minimize backtracking, storage of uneliminated options and 
parallel consideration of alternatives; R-A parsing is directly 
addressed to this problem. (How it differs from other approaches 
'should soon become clear.) Given a question regarding the 
structure of a sentence, the only possible responses by a pure R-A 
parser are 'right answer' and 'no answer'. That is, if at a given 
point there is an indeterminacy asto how to proceed, the currently 
active progn'am odule simply 'passes'. (Certain ambiguities m'e 
thus treated as involving situations where, given several available 
options, no resolution has been made after all relevant infomlation 
has been taken into account.) As many decisions as can be 
reliably made at a given stage of analysis actually are made, but 
any which cannot be made at that point are deferred to later 
stages. The kinds of decisions made during the initial stages of 
parsing do not constitute structure building (i.e. construction of a 
p,'u'se tree or formally equivalent object), though they constrain 
the range of options available when structure building actually 
begins. 
The rationale for' reconnaissance is the fact that the resolution of 
local indeterminacies can depend on following material, and often 
does. Working strictly left-right, even with a 'predictive' parser, 
obviously runs afoul of this problem. Lookahead (Marcus 1980) 
avoids the difficulty to some extent, but could be regarded as 
linguistically unmotivated. That is, the need to invoke it in the 
first place is merely an artifact of failure to capitalize on global 
syntactic information which can be easily recovered from the input 
before any attempt at structure building is made. As a simple 
example, consider a sentence like 1 believe you as opposed to 
e.g. I believe you did it. If reconnaissance first counts the 
number of verbs in the sentence, and finds only one, then the 
possibility that you in the first example could initiate a subordinate 
clause can be eliminated. In the second case, that the Object of 
believe is not an NP can also be determined from cues made 
available by reconnaissance; sc;e Rindflesch forthcoming. 
A particularly troublesome problem to which an R-A-based 
solution seems ideally suited is the ubiquitous category-label 
ambiguity (CLA) found in English. While some instances of 
local CLA can be resolved on tire basis of preceding material, this 
cannot be guaranteed; indeed, ambiguities can pile up awaiting 
disambiguation by later material; as an example, consider the 
CLA exhibited by the first three words in Leave time forms the 
basis for faeuhy renewal. (Given just these words, there are at 
least five distinct structural configurations which could be initiated 
iby this sequence.) In tire approach described in Rindflesch op. 
cit., it is determined during reconnaissance that it is not possible 
for more than one oftbe first three words to be a verb owing to the 
impossibility of constructing a legal 'ordination configuration' (a
representation f the relations of sub- and superordination that 
obtain among predicates in the sentence. ) This follows from the 
? fact that none of the potential w,~rbs can take complements in either 
the Subject or Object relations, and that necessary conditions for 
the occurrence of other kinds of predicate-containing ar uments 
(such as the presence of overt subordinators, like relative 
pronouns) are not satisfied. It is also possible, PRIOR TO ANY 
STRUCTURE BUILDING, to determine thatfi)rms is the actual verb, 
though limitations of space prohibit a detailed explanation. 
(Again, see Rindflesch op. tit.) This approach contrasts vividly 
with more traditional ones, which typicaUy use such brute-force 
methods as backtracking torevoke incorrect hypotheses orparallel 
consideration (actual or simulated) of uneliminated alternatives. 2 
This criticism might seem misplaced since it is an accepted practice 
for grammars which drive parsers to attach a 'likelihood' estimate 
to each rule to aid in the determination f which rule to apply next 
during a parse. But such values are ad hoe assignments which do 
not further our theoretical understanding of parsing natural 
language; a blind guess supported by a likelihood estimate may 
have a statistically better chance of success, but is a blind guess 
nonetheless. (Some authors recognize this fact, e.g. Proudian and 
Pollard (t985), and are carefifl to separate the ad hoe heuristic 
assignment of likelihood measures from the operation of fire parsei 
in general.) Having a reconnaissance phase decreases the extent 
to which it is necessary to rely on blind application of grammar 
rules. The essential idea is to exploit o the fullest possible xtent 
knowledge about the parsing task derived from the particular 
properties of the terrain, in contrast o approaches which use 
heuristic likelihood estimates as an add-on to the actual grammar 
or parser. (For further discussion, see Ryan and Rindflesch 
1986.)

The theoretical framework assumed in our work on R-A parsing is 
corepresentational grammar (Kac 1978, 1985), which has the 
advantage of facilitating precise manipulation of traditional 
grammatical notions such as logical Subject and Object, and sub- 
and superordination. These traditional notions are important 
components in the formulation of linguistically insightful 
strategies for parsing, as illustrated by the critical role played by 
'ordination' relations in the preceding paragraph. 
In order to implement this sort of strategy, it is necesary to 
impose some additional control on the parse beyond what would 
typically be required in a less structured approach. Though 
multiple passes over the input are required and it is necessary to 
explicitly maintain several different sources of information beyond 
the traditional parse tree, the payoff ox' this additional conlrol and 
data is the ability to bypass redundm~t intermediate stages in the 
parse when the input contains ufficient information to allow it. 
Parsing is thus highly data-driven i the sense that only as much 
machinery as is absolutely necessary is used for any particular 
parse, and the specific devices used will vary from case to case. 
The cost of multiple passes, moreover, can be kept relatively low 
given that the goal of each pass is so specialized as to assure that it 
can be completed quickly, while reconnaissance guarantees that 
the absolute number of passes required, even in very complex 
examples, can be kept to a minimum. 
It is helpful to contrast what we have in mind to a system of 
phrase structure rules. Such a system compresses together a
variety of different ypes of information (e.g. information about 
dependencies,  categories, grammatical relations and 
subcategorization), and this compression makes it difficult to 
isolate just the subset of these information types which is most 
relevant o the problem while excluding information which is 
redundant or i~Televant to the current decision point. It seems to 
us less costly and more revealing to organize the grammar 
underlying the parser in a more 'atomistic' way, thus making it 
unnecessary to tease out of the rules infomaation which they do 
not encode in a transparent fashion. For example, the rules 
S ->NPVP NP->ARTN VP->VS 
(if taken by themselves) imply that if a sentence contains two or 
more verbs, each noninitial one must be in its own embedded 
clause. From this it can be deduced that there can be only one 
main verb, but this information (which figures crucially in the 
definition of a legal ordination configuration) is not represented in 
an immediately accessible form. An added complication is 
represented by the fact that while arbitrary proper subsets of a set 
of PS-rules indicate what is PERMITTED, there is no way except 
from consideration f the grammar as a whole to determine what is 
PROHIBITED. 
Our approach facilitates the use of information at stages in the 
parsing process where that information is most useful, which has 
consequences not just for syntactic parsing alone but in integrating 
the syntactic and semantic aspects of the understanding process. It 
has long been recognized that some semantic decisions can be 
made before an entire syntactic parse is available, and that the 
results of these semantic decisions can be used to drive further 
results in the syntactic parse. It is further ecognized that such 
early semantic processing makes good sense computationally, and 
some current systems make good use of this principle. We take 
this idea one step further by allowing the parser to anticipate on 
the basis of very rudimentary and low level cues many structural 
characteristics of the input which traditional approaches cannot 
recognize until substantial structure building has been done. For 
example, in the R-A model described in Kac 1981, it is possible to 
delineate the boundaries of complex NP's before their precise 
constituency is known. 
As noted earlier, R-A parsing is in principle consistent with a 
variety of assumptions about syntactic representation, and is not 
160 
rigidly tied to the assumption that the end result of syntactic 
parsing is a traditional phrase structure tree. (See Kac and 
Manaster-Ramer 1986 for discussion.) The goal of parsing is to 
provide an input to tile semantic omponent, and such an input can 
m principle take a variety of forms (such as a representation f 
predicate-argument structure). 
It is worth pointing out, if it is not already obvious, that we see the 
central issues as linguistic ones first and computational ones 
second in the sense that the kind of approach which seems to us to 
hold out the most promise is one in which efficient parsing is the 
product largely of an adequate qualitative picture of linguistic 
structure. This picture tells us two crucial things: what 
information there is in the input to be exploited, and when it first 
becomes available. We hope to have given at least a preliminary 
indication of how such a picture can contribute to insightful 
solutions to interesting problems in natural language processing. 
Notes 
*The listing of authors is strictly alphabetical. 
1. On the other hand, a compromise model in which some 
features of R-A parsing are exploited has some attractions. For 
example, suppression of the optional that-complementizer in 
sentences like I believe (that) Mary likes Bill slightly increases 
comprehension difficulty, a phenomenon which can be naturally 
interpreted as a short-lived garden path. One possible way to 
distinguish between effects such as the one just mentioned and 
garden pathing from which there is evidently no possibility of 
recovery is to allow some guess-and-back-up processing in the 
reeonaissance phase and to attribute short-lived effects to garden 
pathing prior to the onset of tbe structure building (attack) phase. 
2. We assume that lexical lookup for the entire sentence is done 
before any syntactic processing takes place. This yields the 
advantage of increased modularity, as compared to a system in 
which lexical lookup is incorporated into the syntax; it is thus 
possible to make modifications and revisions in the part of the 
parser which deals with CLAR without the need for 
corresponding revisions in other modules.
