A SYSTEM OF SEMANTIC PRIMITIVES 
Ray Jackendoff  
Department of English 
Brandeis University 
In a l inguist ic theory, the semantic 
representat ion of a sentence is meant to be 
a formal character izat ion of the information 
conveyed by the sentence. This information 
can be thought of as a set of claims abeut 
various individuals, properties, events, 
and/or states of affairs, and about the 
relat ionships among them. A sat is factory 
semantic theory must not only account for 
the informat ion conveyed by a sentence; it 
must a l so  account for how the sentence 
conveys that information, expressing both 
the syntact ic and semantic general izat ions 
of the language. A semantic theory is 
explanatory when l inguist ica l ly  s ignif icant 
general izat ions are inherent in the choice 
of formalism, when the theory claims the 
language would be more complex any other 
way. Such a theory claims that the language 
learner does not have to learn these 
general izat ions;  rather they are determined 
by his innate capabi l i ty to learn a human 
language and to conceptual ize the world. 
This paper sketches a semantic theory 
for verbs, based on the analysis of Gruber 
(1965) and Jackendoff  (1972), which 
expresses certain semantic general izat ions 
in such a way that they correspond very 
closely to syntact ic general izat ions.  The 
general i ty of the semantic analysis wil l  be 
demonstrated by stating inference rules 
whose side appl icabi l i ty  depends crucia l ly  
on the form of the semantics. Thus it wil l  
be shown that the choice of semantic 
pr imit ives made here is explanatory in the 
sense set out above. The theory is 
expounded in much greater detai l  in 
Jackendoff  (1975), of which this is an 
extreme condensation. 
I. GO, BE, and STAY verbs. 
In sentences such as (I), 
(1)a. The train traveled from Detroit to 
Cincinnati .  
b. The hawk flew from its nest to the 
ground. 
c. An apple fell from the tree onto Ike's 
head. 
there is a common element of motion 
expressed. We will refer to the object in 
motion as the Theme of the sentence, to the 
Theme's init ial  posit ion as the Source, and 
to its final posit ion as the Goal. The 
semantic s imi lar i ty  between the sentences in 
(I) is expressed by assigning a common 
element in their semantic representat ion,  a 
function GO(x,y,z).  This function makes the 
claim that there has taken place an event 
consist ing of the motion of x from X to ~. 
In other words, the first var iable of GO 
corresponds to the Theme, the second to the 
Source, and the third to the Goal. 
24 
The semantic di f ferences between the 
sentences are expressed in two dist inct 
ways. First, the different Themes, Sources, 
and Goals are derived by insert ing the 
interpretat ions of the various noun phrases 
in the sentences for the variables x, X, and 
z, according to the lexieal corre lat ion of 
the verb's strict subcategor izat ion feature 
with its semantic representat ion. The other 
semantic di f ferences are descr ibed by adding 
a restr ict ive modif ier  expressing manner of 
motion, in these cases lexical ly determined, 
but in many cases due to an adverb in the 
verb phrase. So, for example, (Ib) is 
represented as 
GO(THE HAWK, ITS NEST, THE GROUND). 
Manner: THROUGH THE AIR 
(I use capitals to represent semantic 
markers for the corresponding Engl ish 
expression -- unsystematical ly,  unless it is 
relevant to the present discussion.)  Of 
course, a full expl icat ion of fly would 
involve further analysis of the manner 
marker; but what is relevant here is that 
the common element of meaning has been 
extracted from all verbs of physical  motion. 
Next consider (2). 
(2)a. Max is in Africa. 
b. The cat lay on the couch. 
c. The statue stands on Cambridge Common. 
These do not descr ibe a motion, but rather 
the location of an object relat ive to some 
object. The formal semantic representat ion 
of (2) wil l  thus include a function BE(x,y), 
where X is the Theme (the object being 
located) and X its Location. As in (I), the 
di f ferences of meaning among the sentences 
in (2) are expressed by subst i tut ing 
different markers for x and X and by 
attaching di f ferent manner markers as 
restr ict ive modif iers  of the function BE. 
In addit ion to the verbs of locat ion 
i l lustrated in (2), there is a second, 
smal ler class of locat ional  verbs with 
rather di f ferent semantic propert ies:  
(3)a. The bacter ia stayed in his body. 
b. Stanley remained in Africa. 
c. Bil l  kept the book on the shelf. 
These differ from (2) in that (i) they 
cannot refer to a point in time, as can (2); 
(ii) they can serve as a complement to what 
happened was that, whereas (2) cannot. 
(4)a. The bacter ia~were in his body at 6:00. 
r L'stayed 
b. The cat| lay on the couch at 6:00. 
\[*remained 
(5) What happened was that 
~tan ley  remained in Africa. 
~ i l l  kept the book on the shelf. 
~Max was in Siberia. 
~The statue stood on Cambridge 
~ommon.  
The verbs in (3) wil l  be represented in part 
as STAY(x,y),  where x is the Theme and X its 
Location. 
I

The evidence from what happened was 
indicates that STAY verbs, like GO verbs, 
represent events, while BE verbs represent 
states of affairs. 
2. Position, Possession, and Ident i f icat ion 
The most important aspect of Gruber's 
analysis is his extension of the 
interpretat ions of GO, BE, and STAY to a 
wide variety of examples where the 
"position" (Source, Goal, or Location), of 
the Theme is not specif ied in physical 
terms, as it is in ( I ) - (3) .  Consider these 
examples: 
(6)a. Harry gave the book to the library. 
b, Charl ie bought the lamp from Max. 
c. Will inherited a mil l ion dollars. 
(7)a. The book belonged to the library. 
b. Max owned an iguana. 
c. Bil l  had no money. 
(8)a. The l ibrary kept the book. 
b. The iguana stayed in Max's possession. 
c. The leopard retained its spots. 
In (6), the object described by the direct 
object of the sentence undergoes a change in 
whom it belongs to. By analogy with (I), we 
can call the object undergoing change the 
Theme, and the initial and final states 
Source and Goal respectively. (7) expresses 
states of possession; by paral lel with (6) 
and (2), we will call the possessed object 
Theme and the possessor Location. (8) also 
expresses a single unchanging possessor; but 
at 6:00 may be added only to (7), not to 
(8), and what happened was may be prefixed 
only to (8), not to (7). 
Thus there is an important paral lel  
between (6)-(8) and (I)-(3). Gruber chooses 
to represent this paral lel by claiming that 
(6) are GO verbs, (7) are BE verbs, and (8) 
are STAY verbs. The difference between 
(6)-(8) and (I)-(3) is expressed by a 
modif ier on the functions. For physical 
motion and location, the modif ier is 
Posit ional; for possession, it is 
Possessional.  (la), for example, is now 
represented as GO~oW,~ (THE TRAIN, DETROIT, 
CINCINATTI);  (6a) is GO~os~ (THE BOOK, 
HARRY, THE LIBRARY). 
Another important "mode of location" 
besides Posit ional and Possessional  is 
i l lustrated in the fol lowing examples. 
(9)a. The coach changed from 
young man into a pumpkin. 
b. The metal turned red. 
c. The ice became mushy. 
a handsome 
(10)a. The coach was a pumpkin. 
b. The metal was red. 
c. The pumpkin seemed tasty. 
(11)a. The poor coach stayed a pumpkin. 
b. The metal remained red. 
c. The redness persisted. 
The same three-way contrast obtains. (9) 
describes changes of state; (10) describes a 
state; (11) describes the persistence of a 
state. Of the two nonmotional cases, at 
6:00 may be added only to (10), and what  
happened was may be prefixed only to (11). 
Gruber proposes a modif ier Identi f icat ional ,  
which indicates that the Location or Source 
and Goal of the function to which it is 
aff ixed make claims about what the Theme is, 
rather than where or whose it is. Thus  for 
example, (9a) is represented as GO~(THE 
COACH, A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, A PUMPKIN). 
(For sentences such as (9a) in which one of 
the arguments is absent from the sentence, 
the semantic representat ion will contain a 
free variable.) 
By adopting the markers Positional, 
Possessional,  and Ident i f icat ional  as 
restr ict ive modif iers on the functions GO, 
BE, and STAY, we capture important semantic 
dist inct ions and general izations. The 
combination of the three markers with each 
of the three functions yields a part icular 
class of verbs, accounting for the 
s imi lar i t ies and differences among the 
classes in a natural way. As evidence that 
this is the correct breakdown, we observe 
that  many verbs occur in more than one 
locational mode, while preserving their 
c lassi f icaton as GO, BE, or STAY verbs: 
(12)a. The coach turned into a driveway. 
(Positional) 
The coach turned into a pumpkin. 
( Identif icatonal) 
b. The train went to Texas. 
(Positional) 
The inheritance went to Philip. 
(Possessional) 
c. Max is in Africa. 
(Positional) 
Max is a doctor. 
( Identif icational)  
d. Bill kept the book on the shelf. 
(Positional) 
Bill kept the book. 
(Possessional) 
e. The coach remained in the driveway. 
(Positional) 
The coach remained a pumpkin. 
( Identi f icat ional)  
In each pair, the same verb is used in two 
different locational  modes. Since these 
uses are not a priori related, it is a 
s ignif icant general izat ion that a sizable 
number of verbs exhibit such behavior. In 
the present formal ism the re lat ionship 
between the uses is clear and nonaccidental:  
the verb stays fundamental ly the same, 
changing only the value of the restr ict ive 
modif ier denoting locational mode. 
The fundamental  concept represented by 
sentences in the present theory, then, is 
giving the location(s) of an object at a 
part icular time or during a part icular  
interval; the richness of expression 
avai lable to natural language comes in part 
from extending the concept of location to 
other than physical position.

3. Causative and Permissive Agency 
In addit ion to the three functions 
discussed so far, there are two which 
describe different kinds of causation. 
Compare (13a,b,c). 
(13)a. The rock fell from the roof to the 
ground. 
Dick received the money. 
The bird went out of the cage. 
Noga stayed sick. 
b. Linda lowered the rock from the roof 
to the ground. 
Dick acquired the money. 
Laura took the bird from the cage. 
David kept Noga sick. 
c. Linda dropped the rock from the roof 
to the ground. 
Dick accepted the money. 
Laura released the bird from the 
cage. 
David left Noga sick. 
The events of the a. sentences are also 
described in the b. and c. sentences, but 
the latter two claim that the events are due 
to the agency of the subject, who is thus 
termed an Agent. In turn, (13b,c) differ in 
the kind of action performed by the Agent: 
(13b) is br inging the event about, or 
causing: (13c) is ceasing to prevent the 
event, or letting. We will symbolize these 
two kinds of agency as CAUSE (x,e) and LET 
(x,e) respectively. The first examples of 
each group in (13) receive the 
representat ions (14a,b,c) respectively. 
(14)a. GO@o~ (THE ROCK, THE ROOF, THE 
GROUND) 
b. CAUSE (LINDA, GO p~ (THE ROCK, THE 
ROOF, THE GROUND)) 
c. LET (LINDA, GOIBo~ (THE ROCK, THE 
ROOF, THE GROUND)) 
The last sentences in each group are 
(15a,b,c,). 
(15)a. STAY~ (NOGA, SICK) 
b. CAUSE (DAVID, STAY~ (NOGA, SICK)) 
c. LET (DAVID, STAY~ (NOGA, SICK)) 
CAUSE is quite famil iar from the 
l iterature, LET less so. There are two 
interest ing dist inct ions between them 
besides the inferences to be discussed 
below. First, CAUSE allows an expression of 
instrument, but LET appears not to: in (16) 
the with-phrase can be interpreted only as 
accompaniment.  
(16)a. Linda dropped the rock with a cable. 
b. Dick accepted the book with a $5 
bill. 
c. David left the bird in the cage with 
a lock on the door. 
Second, the final argument of LET may be 
either an event or a state of affairs, as 
seen from the fol lowing contrast. 
(17)a. David let Laura out of the room. 
b. David al lowed Laura out of the room. 
26 
(17a) must be interpreted as David 
permitt ing Laura to gg out of the room; 
(17b) does not say anything about her 
movements, but only where she may be. On 
the other hand, CAUSE requires its final 
argument to be an event. All the causative 
locational verbs such as hold, keep and 
retain are of the form CAUSE (x, STAY(.. .))  
rather than CAUSE (X, BE(...)).  The verb 
cause, which does al low things like Doll ie 
caused Martin to be happy, has a more 
compl icated analysis than just CAUSE, as 
will be seen below in (36). (One should be 
immediately suspicious, since this example 
means "Doll ie caused Martin to become 
happy" -- see (40b) below). 
4. Inference Rules 
We will now develop inference rules to 
derive logical entai lments of sentences on 
the basis of their semantic representatins.  
An obvious rule of inference is that if an 
event is caused, it happens. This is 
formal ized as (18). 
(18) CAUSE(X,E) -> E 
A typical inference derivable by this rule 
is (19). 
(19) Max gave Joe the money. 
CAUSE(MAX, 
GO~ (THE MONEY, MAX, JOE)) 
-> Joe received the money from Max. 
GO~s~ (THE MONEY, MAX, JOE) 
The related inference with LET is that if 
someone doesn't let an event happen, it 
doesn't happen: 
(20) NOT LET(X,E) -> NOT E 
A typical inference from this rule is (21). 
(21) AI didn't drop the pancake to the 
floor. 
NOT LET(AL, 
GO~o~ (THE PANCAKE,y, 
THE FLOOR)) 
-> The pancake didn't fall to the floor 
NOT GO?oW~ (THE PANCAKE,y,THE FLOOR) 
The inverses of these inference rules are 
not valid in general: something may happen 
even if no part icular thing one can name is 
its cause; if something is permitted, that 
does not guarantee that it happens (although 
in certain s i tuat ions such as drooping the 
inference does go through). 
The rest of the inference rules concern 
GO, STAY, and BE, and can be stated in terms 
of simple spatial  intuit ions. First, there 
is the pr inciple that if someone stays 
someplace for a period of time, he is in 
that place at any instant during that time. 
(22) STAY (X,Y) FROM t~ TO t& 
-> BE (X,Y) AT t s 
Condition: t i~t~t  ~

22) permits inferences such as (23). 
23) Carl remained in the room from Tuesday 
to Friday. 
STAY~ (CARL, THE ROOM) 
FROM TUESDAY TO FRIDAY 
-> Carl was in the room on Wednesday. 
BEe~.~(CARL, THE ROOM) AT WEDNESDAY 
(18) and (22) work together in this 
inference (assuming proper times): 
(24) David kept Noga Sick 
-> Noga stayed sick 
-> Noga was sick. 
CAUSE(DAVID, STAY~ (NOGA,SICK)) 
STAY~L~% (NOGA,SICK) 
BE~k (NOGA,SICK) 
The inverse inference is that if 
someone doesn't stay someplace during an 
interval, there is a time during the 
interval when he isn't there. This can be 
formalized similarly. 
The paral lel  inference rule for GO is 
that if something goes from one place to 
another, it was at the first place first and 
the second place second: 
(25) GO(X,Y,Z) AT t~ -> 
for some times t~,~ such that 
t~<t~ <t~, 
BE (X,Y) AT t~ 
BE (X,Z) AT 
A typical entai lment from this rule is (26). 
(26) Phil gave the bill to Lyn. 
CAUSE(PHIL,GO~.~(THE BILL,PHIL,LYN)) 
GO~$~(THE BILL,PHIL,LYN) 
~ Phil had the bill, and then Lyn had 
it. 
BE~(THE BILL,PHIL) AT t a AND 
BE~Q~(THE BILL,LYN) AT t~ 
for some t I , tm such that t~<t L 
There is no inference from NOT GO, since if 
someone didn't go from one place to another 
we can make no inferences about where he was 
at any time, without further knowledge. 
A very important inference rule is that 
if and only if someone is not someplace, he 
is somewhere else. We represent the sense 
"a place other than Z" as NOT Z, for reasons 
to become clear shortly. 
(27) NOT BE (X,Z)<->BE (X, NOT Z) 
Also, if and only if someone is someplace, 
he is not elsewhere. 
I (28) BE (X,Z)<->NOT BE (X, NOT Z) 
These rules play a role in inferences such 
as if John was not inside the house, he was 
I outside of it (Positional); if either John 
? or Bill had the book and John didn't, then 
Bill did (Possessional); and if Sue was 
sick, she wasn't healthy (Identif icational).  
I The complete derivation of such inferences, 
however, involves other steps including 
I 
27 
factual knowledge, and is too complex to 
include here. 
Similar to (27)-(28) are inference 
rules (which we won't formalize here) that 
if you're going someplace you're not staying 
anywhere, and if you re staying someplace 
you re not going anywhere. 
What makes the sort of inference rules 
proposed here of interest is the way they 
provide evidence for the explanatory power 
of the present theory of semantic 
description. For in this system, a rule of 
inference is simpler if it general izes over 
all modes of location. The theory claims 
that it is no accident that the inference 
rules general ize in the way they 
do -- rather it is an essential part of the 
structure of the semantic description. I 
consider it a striking property of the 
present system that very simple principles 
about spatial understanding can be stated 
formally in such a way that they provide a 
rich variety of inferences in domains which 
bear no a priori relation to physical space. 
5. Circumstant ia l  Location 
Consider the ~ interpretat ions of 
(29a,b). 
(29) a. Laura kept David in the room. 
b. Laura kept David working. (In 
deep structure, Laura kept David 
\[~David working\]) 
The interpretat ion of (29a) is 
CAUSE(LAURA,STAY~,~(DAVID,  THE ROOM)). If 
the verb keep is to be essential ly the same 
in (29b), we must provide (29b) with a 
similar interpretation, though clearly none 
of the modes of location discussed so far 
can provide one. We introduce a mode called 
Circumstantial :  if an individual is in a 
Circumstant ia l  Location, where the location 
is an event or state of affairs, this is 
taken to mean that the individual is 
involved as a part icipant in that event or 
state of affairs. Then we can assign (29b) 
the reading (30). 
(30) CAUSE(LAURA,STAY~,~(DAVID,DAVID WORK)) 
This claims that Laura caused David to 
continue to be involved in the situation of 
working, precisely the desired 
interpretation, and furthermore of precisely 
parallel form to its Posit ional analogue 
(29a). Other examples: 
(31) a. Linda kept Laura (away) from the 
cookie jar. 
CAUSE(LINDA,STAY?o~,~(LAURA, NOT THE 
COOKIE JAR)) 
~kept \] 
b. L inda|prevented~ Laura from 
screaming. 
CAUSE(LINDA,STAYaj~(LAURA, NOT(LAURA 
SCREAM))) 
kept \] 
(32) LauraLcont inued~screaming.  
STAY~,&~ (LAURA, LAURA SCREAM) 
(33) a. David avoided the beach. 
STAY~ (DAVID, NOT THE BEACH) 
b. Dav id  avoided playing checkers. 
STAY~,~ (DAVID,NOT(DAVID 
CHECKERS)) 
PLAY 
(34) a. Jim forced the ball into the hole. 
CAUSE( J IM ,GO~(THE BALL,y,THE 
HOLE)) 
b. Jim forced Phil into confesing. 
to confess. 
CAUSE(JIM,GO?,~(PHIL,y, 
PHIL CONFESS))' 
(35) Dick stopped the car from coughing. 
CAUSE(DICK,GO?,$~. (THE CAR,y, 
NOT(THE CAR 
COUGH))) 
(36) Dollie caused Martin to be happy. 
CAUSE(DOLL IE ,GO~(MARTIN ,y ,  
BE~(MARTIN ,HAPPY) ) )  
(37) a. John allowed Fred in the room. 
LET( JOHN,BE~ (FRED, THE ROOM)) 
b. John allowed Fred to wash the 
dishes. 
LET(JOHN,BE~,~. (FRED, 
FRED WASH THE DISHES)) 
(38) Jack exempted Jim from fighting. 
LET(JACK BE~ (JIM,NOT(JIM FIGHT))) 
There are four points to observe about 
these representations. First, where a verb 
that takes a sentential complement has a 
Positional variant, the two versions of the 
verb have identical representatons but for 
the locational mode. Thus in the present 
system it is no accident that the verb 
occurs in two seeming disparate syntactic 
and semantic frames. 
Second, the NOT meaning "somewhere 
other than" in Positional contexts appears 
to generalize fully with the NOT of sentence 
negation in Circumstantial contexts. 
Third, complement type is related to 
semantic representation. Gerundives 
typically correspond to Locations or Goals; 
from-ing complements are negated Locations 
and negated Goals; to-infinitive complements 
are Goals of various sorts (including Goals 
of intentions, not discussed here); 
that-complements are typically Themes. The 
correspondence is hardly exact partly 
because there are far more semantic 
positions for clauses than there are 
complement types: but it is far from random 
either. 
Fourth, and most striking, the 
inference rules of the previous section can 
be applied to Circumstantial verbs quite 
freely. Given the special inference rule 
(39), which follows immediately from the 
definition of Circumstantial location, we 
can derive such inferences as (40) (omitting 
time dependencies). 
28 
(39) BEc,~ (X,E)->E 
(40) a. Laura kept David working. 
CAUSE(LAURA,STAY~,~.(DAVID, DAVID WORK))

b. Lyn caused Bob to be happy.

Bob was unhappy and later he was happy. 
BE~BOB,  NOT HAPPY) and later 
BE~%(BOB,  HAPPY) 
c. Jack didn't exempt Jim from 
fighting. 
NOT LET(JACK, BE~,~(JIM,NOT(JIM FIGHT))) 
NOT BEc~.~(JIM , NOT(JIM FIGHT)) 
(~  BE~ (JIM, JIM FIGHT) 
Jim fought. 
JIM FIGHT 
This kind of inference is characteristic of 
the "implicative" verbs described by 
Karttunen (1971). In the present system it 
follows immediately from the semantic 
analysis and the generalization of the 
inference rules for spatial location to the 
circumstantial mode. 
Lest the generalization from Positional 
to Circumstantial should still seem marginal 
and unmotivated, notice that it is quite 
pervasive in the language. For a few very 
clear random examples, consider t_go come t_go 
b__ge called Max, to lead someone to believe, 
t__oo drive someone t__oo confess, t__q bring 
oneself t__oo acknowledge something, and, among 
nominals, the way to find out. For an even 
more interesting example, consider the 
meaning of force in (34a). In addition to 
the semantic description given there, there 
is a marker of manner roughly paraphrasable 
as "by applying pressure against the ball's 
resistance." Here the concepts of pressure, 
applying pressure, and resistance are purely 
physical. But in fact the same manner 
marker "by applying pressure against Phil's 
resistance', is miraculously perfect for 
(34b), where the concepts of pressure, 
applying pressure, and resistance are much 
more abstract in nature. Surely this is no 
coincidence; it argues that the extension

from Positional to Circumstantial is highly 
determined in human cognition, and that the 
generalization of a verb's meaning follows 
innate lines of analogy. The present theory 
of semantic description is explanatory in 
that these generalizations fall out 
immediately from the choice of semantic 
primitives, which are in turn chosen on 
linguistic grounds. 
This result is consistent with Piaget's 
v iew (1947, 1970) that (nonverbal) knowledge 
of physical spatial relations is the .most 
basic sort of knowledge we have, and that 
all other kinds of knoweldge develop out of 
it. Within such a framework, the inference 
rules proposed here are not merely 
linguistic but conceptual, and correspond 
closely to Piaget's principles of 
conservation and identity. The growth in 
one's ability to  handle abstraction then 
consists (in part) in understanding new 
modes of location and being able to 
generalize the rules of inference to a new 
system of relations. If this is so, the 
theory proposed here is a deep result not 
only for linguistic theory but for the study 
of human conceptualization.
