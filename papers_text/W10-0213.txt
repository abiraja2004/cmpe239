Abstract
We investigate the effect of text summarisa-
tion in the problem of rating-inference ? the
task of associating a fine-grained numerical
rating to an opinionated document. We set-up
a comparison framework to study the effect of
different summarisation algorithms of various
compression rates in this task and compare the
classification accuracy of summaries and doc-
uments for associating documents to classes.
We make use of SVM algorithms to associate
numerical ratings to opinionated documents.
The algorithms are informed by linguistic and
sentiment-based features computed from full
documents and summaries. Preliminary re-
sults show that some types of summaries could
be as effective or better as full documents in
this problem.
1 Introduction
Public opinion has a great impact on company and
government decision making. In particular, compa-
nies have to constantly monitor public perception of
their products, services, and key company represen-
tatives to ensure that good reputation is maintained.
Recent cases of public figures making headlines for
the wrong reasons have shown how companies take
into account public opinion to distance themselves
from figures which can damage their public image.
The Web has become an important source for find-
ing information, in the field of business intelligence,
business analysts are turning their eyes to the Web
in order to monitor public perception on products,
services, policies, and managers. The field of senti-
ment analysis has recently emerged (Pang and Lee,
2008) as an important area of research in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) which can provide vi-
able solutions for monitoring public perception on
a number of issues; with evaluation programs such
as the Text REtrieval Conference track on blog min-
ing 1, the Text Analysis Conference 2 track on opin-
ion summarisation, and the DEfi Fouille de Textes
program (Grouin et al, 2009) advances in the state
of the art have been produced. Although sentiment
analysis involves various different problems such as
identifying subjective sentences or identifying posi-
tive and negative opinions in text, here we concen-
trate on the opinion classification task; and more
specifically on rating-inference, the task of identify-
ing the author?s evaluation of an entity with respect
to an ordinal-scale based on the author?s textual eval-
uation of the entity (Pang and Lee, 2005). The spe-
cific problem we study in this paper is that of as-
sociating a fine-grained rating (1=worst,...5=best)
to a review. This is in general considered a dif-
ficult problem because of the fuzziness inherent of
mid-range ratings (Mukras et al, 2007). A consid-
erable body of research has recently been produced
to tackle this problem (Chakraborti et al, 2007; Fer-
rari et al, 2009) and reported figures showing accu-
racies ranging from 30% to 50% for such complex
task; most approaches derive features for the classi-
fication task from the full document. In this research
we ask whether extracting features from document
summaries could help a classification system. Since
text summaries are meant to contain the essential
content of a document (Mani, 2001), we investigate
whether filtering noise through text summarisation
is of any help in the rating-inference task. In re-

107
cent years, text summarisation has been used to sup-
port both manual and automatic tasks; in the SUM-
MAC evaluation (Mani et al, 1998), text summaries
were tested in document classification and ques-
tion answering tasks where summaries were consid-
ered suitable surrogates for full documents; Bagga
and Baldwin (1998) studied summarisation in the
context of a cross-document coreference task and
found that summaries improved the performance of
a clustering-based coreference mechanism; more re-
cently Latif and McGee (2009) have proposed text
summarisation as a preprocessing step for student
essay assessment finding that summaries could be
used instead of full essays to group ?similar? qual-
ity essays. Summarisation has been studied in the
field of sentiment analysis with the objective of pro-
ducing opinion summaries, however, to the best of
our knowlegde there has been little research on the
study of document summarisation as a text pro-
cessing step for opinion classification. This paper
presents a framework and extensive experiments on
text summarisation for opinion classification, and in
particular, for the rating-inference problem. We will
present results indicating that some types of sum-
maries could be as effective or better than the full
documents in this task.
The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 will compile the existing work with
respect to the inference-rating problem; Section 3
and Section 4 will describe the corpus and the NLP
tools used for all the experimental set-up. Next, the
text summarisation approaches will be described in
Section 5, and then Section 6 will show the exper-
iments conducted and the results obtained together
with a discussion. Finally, we will draw some con-
clusions and address further work in Section 7.
2 Related Work
Most of the literature regarding sentiment analysis
addresses the problem either by detecting and clas-
sifying opinions at a sentence level (Wilson et al,
2005; Du and Tan, 2009), or by attempting to cap-
ture the overall sentiment of a document (McDonald
et al, 2007; Hu et al, 2008). Traditional approaches
tackle the task as binary classification, where text
units (e.g. words, sentences, fragments) are classi-
fied into positive vs. negative, or subjective vs. ob-
jective, according to their polarity and subjectivity
degree, respectively. However, sentiment classifica-
tion taking into account a finer granularity has been
less considered. Rating-inference is a particular task
within sentiment analysis, which aims at inferring
the author?s numerical rating for a review. For in-
stance, given a review and 5-star-rating scale (rang-
ing from 1 -the worst- to 5 -the best), this task should
correctly predict the review?s rating, based on the
language and sentiment expressed in its content.
In (Pang and Lee, 2005), the rating-inference
problem is analysed for the movies domain. In
particular, the utility of employing label and item
similarity is shown by analysing the performance
of three different methods based on SVM (one vs.
all, regression and metric labeling), in order to infer
the author?s implied numerical rating, which ranges
from 1 up to 4 stars, depending on the degree the au-
thor of the review liked or not the film. The approach
described in (Leung et al, 2006) suggests the use of
collaborative filtering algorithms together with sen-
timent analysis techniques to obtain user preferences
expressed in textual reviews, focusing also on movie
reviews. Once the opinion words from user reviews
have been identified, the polarity of those opinion
words together with their strength need to be com-
puted and mapped to the rating scales to be further
input to the collaborative input algorithms.
Apart from these approaches, this problem is
stated from a different point of view in (Shimada
and Endo, 2008). Here it is approached from the
perspective of rating different details of a product
under the same review. Consequently, they rename
the problem as ?seeing several stars? instead of only
one, corresponding to the overall sentiment of the
review. Also, in (Baccianella et al, 2009) the rating
of different features regarding hotel reviews (cleanli-
ness, location, staff, etc.) is addressed by analysing
several aspects involved in the generation of prod-
uct review?s representations, such as part-of-speech
and lexicons. Other approaches (Devitt and Ahmad,
2007), (Turney, 2002) face this problem by group-
ing documents with closer stars under the same cat-
egory, i.e. positive or negative, simplifying the task
into a binary classification problem.
Recently, due to the vast amount of on-line infor-
mation and the subjectivity appearing in documents,
the combination of sentiment analysis and summari-
108
sation task in tandem can result in great benefits
for stand-alone applications of sentiment analysis,
as well as for the potential uses of sentiment analy-
sis as part of other NLP applications (Stoyanov and
Cardie, 2006). Whilst there is much literature com-
bining sentiment analysis and text summarisation
focusing on generating opinion-oriented summaries
for the new textual genres, such as blogs (Lloret
et al, 2009), or reviews (Zhuang et al, 2006), the
use of summaries as substitutes of full documents in
tasks such as rating-inference has been not yet ex-
plored to the best of our knowledge. In contrast to
the existing literature, this paper uses summaries in-
stead of full reviews to tackle the rating-inference
task in the financial domain, and we carry out a pre-
liminary analysis concerning the potential benefits
of text summaries for this task.
3 Dataset for the Rating-inference Task
Since there is no standard dataset for carrying out
the rating-inference task, the corpus used for our ex-
periments was one associated to a current project on
business intelligence we are working on. These data
consisted of 89 reviews of several English banks
(Abbey, Barcalys, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, and
National Westminster) gathered from the Internet. In
particular the documents were collected from Ciao3,
a Website where users can write reviews about dif-
ferent products and services, depending on their own
experience.
Table 1 lists some of the statistical properties of
the data. It is worth stressing upon the fact that
the reviews have on average 2,603 words, which
means that we are dealing with long documents
rather than short ones, making the rating-inference
task even more challenging. The shortest document
contains 1,491 words, whereas the longest document
has more than 5,000 words.
# Reviews Avg length Max length Min length
89 2,603 5,730 1,491
Table 1: Corpus Statistics
Since the aim of the task we are pursuing focuses
on classifying correctly the star for a review (rang-
ing from 1 to 5 stars), it is necessary to study how
3http://www.ciao.co.uk/
many reviews we have for each class, in order to see
whether we have a balanced distribution or not. Ta-
ble 2 shows this numbers for each star-rating. It is
worth mentioning that one-third of the reviews be-
long to the 4-star class. In contrast, we have only 9
reviews that have been rated as 3-star, consisting of
the 10% of the corpus, which is a very low number.

4 Natural Language Processing Tools
Linguistic analysis of textual input is carried out
using the General Architecture for Text Engineer-
ing (GATE) ? a framework for the development and
deployment of language processing technology in
large scale (Cunningham et al, 2002). We make use
of typical GATE components: tokenisation, parts of
speech tagging, and morphological analysis to pro-
duce document annotations. From the annotations
we produce a number of features for document rep-
resentation. Features produced from the annotations
are: string ? the original, unmodified text of each
token; root ? the lemmatised, lower-case form of
the token; category ? the part-of-speech (POS) tag, a
symbol that represents a grammatical category such
as determiner, present-tense verb, past-tense verb,
singular noun, etc.; orth ? a code representing the to-
ken?s combination of upper- and lower-case letters.
In addition to these basic features, ?sentiment? fea-
tures based on a lexical resource are computed as
explained below.
4.1 Sentiment Features
SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is a lexi-
cal resource in which each synset (set of synonyms)
of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is associated with
three numerical scores obj (how objective the word
is), pos (how positive the word is), and neg (how
negative the word is). Each of the scores ranges
from 0 to 1, and their sum equals 1. SentiWord-
Net word values have been semi-automatically com-
puted based on the use of weakly supervised classi-
109
fication algorithms. In this work we compute the
?general sentiment? of a word in the following way:
given a word w we compute the number of times the
word w is more positive than negative (positive >
negative), the number of times is more negative than
positive (positive < negative) and the total number
of entries of word w in SentiWordNet, therefore we
can consider the overall positivity or negativity a
particular word has in SentiWordNet. We are in-
terested in words that are generally ?positive?, gen-
erally ?negative? or generally ?neutral? (not much
variation between positive and negative). For exam-
ple a word such as ?good? has many more entries
where the positive score is greater than the nega-
tivity score while a word such as ?unhelpful? has
more negative occurrences than positive. We use this
aggregated scores in our classification experiments.
Note that we do not apply any word sense disam-
biguation procedure here.
4.2 Machine Learning Tool
For the experiments reported here, we adopt a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) learning paradigm not
only because it has recently been used with suc-
cess in different tasks in natural language processing
(Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), but it has been shown
particularly suitable for text categorization (Kumar
and Gopal, 2009) where the feature space is huge, as
it is in our case. We rely on the support vector ma-
chines implementation distributed with the GATE
system (Li et al, 2009) which hides from the user
the complexities of feature extraction and conver-
sion from documents to the machine learning imple-
mentation. The tool has been applied with success
to a number of datasets for opinion classification and
rating-inference (Saggion and Funk, 2009).
5 Text Summarisation Approach
In this Section, three approaches for carrying out the
summarisation process are explained in detail. First,
a generic approach is taken as a basis, and then, it is
adapted into a query-focused and a opinion-oriented
approach, respectively.
5.1 Generic Summarisation
A generic text summarisation approach is first taken
as a core, in which three main stages can be distin-
guished: i) document preprocessing; ii) relevance
detection; and ii) summary generation. Since we
work with Web documents, an initial preprocessing
step is essential to remove all unnecessary tags and
noisy information. Therefore, in the first stage the
body of the review out of the whole Web page is
automatically delimitated by means of patterns, and
only this text is used as the input for the next sum-
marisation stages. Further on, a sentence relevance
detection process is carried out employing different
combinations of various techniques. In particular,
the techniques employed are:
Term frequency (tf ): this technique has been
widely used in different summarisation approaches,
showing the the most frequent words in a document
contain relevant information and can be indicative of
the document?s topic (Nenkova et al, 2006)
Textual entailment (te): a te module (Ferra?ndez
et al, 2007) is used to detect redundant information
in the document, by computing the entailment be-
tween two consecutive sentences and discarding the
entailed ones. The identification of these entailment
relations helps to avoid incorporating redundant in-
formation in summaries.
Code quantity principle (cqp): this is a linguis-
tic principle which proves the existence of a propor-
tional relation between how important the informa-
tion is, and the number of coding elements it has
(Givo?n, 1990). In this approach we assume that sen-
tences containing longer noun-phrases are more rel-
evant.
The aforementioned techniques are combined
together taking always into account the term-
frequency, leading to different summarisation strate-
gies (tf, te+tf, cqp+tf, te+cqp+tf ). Finally, the re-
sulting summary is produced by extracting the high-
est scored sentences up to the desired length, accord-
ing the techniques explained.
5.2 Query-focused Summarisation
Through adapting the generic summarisation ap-
proach into a query-focused one, we could benefit
from obtaining more specific sentences with regard
to the topic of the review. As a preliminary work, we
are going to assume that a review is about a bank,
and as a consequence, the name of the bank is con-
sidered to be the topic. It is worth mentioning that a
person can refer to a specific bank in different ways.
For example, in the case of ?The National Westmin-
110
ster Bank?, it can be referred to as ?National West-
minster? or ?NatWest?. Such different denomina-
tions were manually identified and they were used
to biased the content of the generated summaries,
employing the same techniques of tf, te and the cqp
combined together. One limitation of this approach
is that we do not directly deal with the coreference
problem, so for example, sentences containing pro-
nouns referring also to the bank, will not be taken
into consideration in the summarisation process. We
are aware of this limitation and for future work it
would be necessary to run a coreference algorithm
to identify all occurrences of a bank within a review.
However, since the main goal of this paper is to carry
out a preliminary analysis of the usefulness of sum-
maries in contrast to whole reviews in the rating-
inference problem, we did not take this problem into
account at this stage of the research. In addition,
when we do query-focused summarisation only we
rely on the SUMMA toolkit (Saggion, 2008) to pro-
duce a query similarity value for each sentence in the
review which in turn is used to rank sentences for an
extractive summary (qf ). This similarity value is the
cosine similarity between a sentence vector (terms
and weights) and a query vector (terms and weigths)
and where the query is the name of the entity being
reviewed (e.g. National Westminster).
5.3 Opinion-oriented Summarisation
Since reviews are written by people who want to
express their opinion and experience with regard
to a bank, in this particular case, either generic or
query-focused summaries can miss including some
important information concerning their sentiments
and feelings towards this particular entity. There-
fore, a sentiment classification system similar to the
one used in (Balahur-Dobrescu et al, 2009) is used
together with the summarisation approach, in order
to generate opinion-oriented summaries. First of all,
the sentences containing opinions are identified, as-
signing each of them a polarity (positive and neg-
ative) and a numerical value corresponding to the
polarity strength (the higher the negative score, the
more negative the sentence and similarly, the higher
the positive score, the more positive the sentence).
Sentences containing a polarity value of 0 are con-
sidered neutral and are not taken into account. Once
the sentences are classified into positives, negatives
and neutrals, they are grouped together according
to its type. Further on, the same combination of
techniques as for previously explained summarisa-
tion approaches are then used.
Additionally, a summary containing only the most
positive and negative sentences is also generated (we
have called this type of summaries sent) in order to
check whether the polarity strength on its own could
be a relevant feature for the summarisation process.
6 Evaluation Environment
In this Section we are going to describe in detail all
the experimental set-up. Firstly, we will explain the
corpus we used together with some figures regard-
ing some statistics computed. Secondly, we will de-
scribe in-depth all the experiments we ran and the re-
sults obtained. Finally, an extensive discussion will
be given in order to analyse all the results and draw
some conclusions.
6.1 Experiments and Results
The main objective of the paper is to investigate the
influence of summaries in contrast to full reviews for
the rating-inference problem.
The purpose of the experiments is to analyse the
performance of the different suggested text sum-
marisation approaches and compare them to the per-
formance of the full review. Therefore, the experi-
ments conducted were the following: for each pro-
posed summarisation approach, we experimented
with five different types of compression rates for
summaries (ranging from 10% to 50%). Apart from
the full review, we dealt with 14 different sum-
marisation approaches (4 for generic, 5 for query-
focused and 5 for opinion-oriented summarisation),
as well as 2 baselines (lead and final, taking the first
or the last sentences according to a specific compres-
sion rate, respectively). Each experiment consisted
of predicting the correct star of a review, either with
the review as a whole or with one of the summari-
sation approaches. As we previously said in Sec-
tion 4, for predicting the correct star-rating, we used
machine learning techniques. In particular, differ-
ent features were used to train a SVM classifier with
10-fold cross validation4 , using the whole review:
4The classifier used was the one integrated within the GATE
framework: http://gate.ac.uk/
111
the root of each word, its category, and the calcu-
lated value employing the SentiWordNet lexicon, as
well as their combinations. As a baseline for the full
document we took into account a totally uninformed
approach with respect to the class with higher num-
ber of reviews, i.e. considering all documents as if
they were scored with 4 stars. The different results
according different features can be seen in Table 3.

category 0.367

root+sentiWN 0.333
category+sentiWN 0.389
root+category+sentiWN 0.413
Table 3: F-measure results using the full review for clas-
sification
Regarding the features for training the summaries,
it is worth mentioning that the best performing fea-
ture when no sentiment-based features are taken into
account is the one using the root of the words. Con-
sequently, this feature was used to train the sum-
maries. Moreover, since the best results using the
full review were obtained using the combination of
the all the features (root+category+sentiWN), we
also selected this combination to train the SVM
classifier with our summaries. Conducting both
experiments, we could analyse to what extent the
sentiment-based feature benefit the classification
process.
The results obtained are shown in Table 4 and
Table 5, respectively. These tables show the F-
measure value obtained for the classification task,
when features extracted from summaries are used
instead from the full review. On the one hand,
results using the root feature extracted from sum-
maries can be seen in Table 4. On the other hand,
Table 5 shows the results when the combination
of all the linguistic and sentiment-based features
(root+category+sentiWN), that has been extracted
from summaries, are used for training the SVM clas-
sifier.
We also performed two statistical tests in order
to measure the significance for the results obtained.
The tests we performed were the one-way Analy-
sis of Variance (ANOVA) and the t-test (Spiegel and
Castellan, 1998). Given a group of experiments, we
first run ANOVA for analysing the difference be-
tween their means. In case some differences are
found, we run the t-test between those pairs.
6.2 Discussion
A first analysis derived from the results obtained in
Table 3 makes us be aware of the difficulty associ-
ated to the rating-inference task. As can be seen,
a baseline without any information from the docu-
ment at all, is performing around 30%, which com-
pared to the remaining approaches is not a very bad
number. However, we assumed that dealing with
some information contained in documents, the clas-
sification algorithm will do better in finding the cor-
rect star associated to a review. This was the rea-
son why we experimented with different features
alone or in combination. From these experiments,
we obtained that the combination of linguistic and
semantic-based features leads to the best results, ob-
taining a F-measure value of 41%. If sentiment-
based features are not taken into account, the best
feature is the root of the word on its own. Further-
more, in order to analyse further combinations, we
ran some experiments with bigrams. However, the
results obtained did not improve the ones we already
had, so they are not reported in this paper.
As far as the results is concerned comparing the
use of summaries to the full document, it is worth
mentioning that when using specific summarisation
approaches, such as query-focused summaries com-
bined with term-frequency, we get better results than
using the full document with a 90% confidence in-
terval, according to a t-test. In particular, qf for 10%
is significant with respect to the full document, us-
ing only root as feature for training. For the results
regarding the combination of root, category and Sen-
tiWordNet, qf for 10% and qf+tf for 10% and 20%
are significant with respect to the full document.
Concerning the different summarisation ap-
proaches, it cannot be claimed a general tendency
about which ones may lead to the best results. We
also performed some significance tests between dif-
ferent strategies, and in most of the cases, the t-
test and the ANOVA did not report significance
over 95%. Only a few approaches were significant
at a 95% confidence level, for instance, te+cqp+tf
and sent+te+cqp+tf with respect to sent+cqp+tf

for 10%; sent+tf in comparison to sent+cqp+tf

and 50% compression rates. Other examples of
the approaches that were significant at a 90%
level of confidence are qf for 10% with respect to
sent+te+cqp+tf. Due to the wide range of summari-
sation strategies tested in the experiments, the results
obtained vary a lot and, due to the space limitations,
it is not possible to report all the tables. What it
seems to be clear from the results is that the code
quantity principle (see Section 5) is not contributing
much to the summarisation process, thus obtaining
poor results when it is employed. Intuitively, this
can be due to the fact that after the first mention of
the bank, there is a predominant use of pronouns,
and as a consequence, the accuracy of the tool that
identifies noun-phrases could be affected. The same
reason could be affecting the term-frequency calcu-
lus, as it is computed based on the lemmas of the
words, not taking into account the pronouns that re-
fer also to them.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presented a preliminary study of
inference-rating task. We have proposed here a new
framework for comparison and extrinsic evaluation
of summaries in a text-based classification task. In
our research, text summaries generated using differ-
ent strategies were used for training a SVM classifier
instead of full reviews. The aim of this task was to
correctly predict the category of a review within a 1
to 5 star-scale. For the experiments, we gathered 89
bank reviews from the Internet and we generated 16
summaries of 5 different compression rates for each
of them (80 different summaries for each review,
having generated in total 7,120 summaries). We also
experimented with several linguistic and sentiment-
based features for the classifier. Although the re-
sults obtained are not significant enough to state
that summaries really help the rating-inference task,
we have shown that in some cases the use of sum-
maries (e.g. query/entity-focused summaries) could
offer competitive advantage over the use of full doc-
uments and we have also shown that some summari-
sation techniques do not degrade the performance of
a rating-inference algorithm when compared to the
use of full documents. We strongly believe that this
preliminary study could serve as a starting point for
future developments.
Although we have carried out extensive experi-
mentation with different summarisation techniques,
compression rates, and document/summary features,
there are many issues that we have not explored. In
the future, we plan to investigate whether the re-
sults could be affected by the class distribution of
the reviews, and in this line we would like to see the
distribution of the documents using clustering tech-

Table 5: Classification results (F-measure) for summaries using root, category and SentiWordNet (lead = first sen-
tences; final = last sentences; tf = term frequency; te = textual entailment; cqp = code quantity principle with
noun-phrases; qf = query-focused summaries; and sent = opinion-oriented summaries)
niques. Moreover, we would also like to investigate
what it would happen if we consider the values of the
star-rating scale as ordinal numbers, and not only as
labels for categories. We will replicate the exper-
iments presented here using as evaluation measure
the ?mean square error? which has been pinpointed
as a more appropriate measure for categorisation in
an ordinal scale. Finally, in the medium to long-
term we plan to extent the experiments and analy-
sis to other available datasets in different domains,
such as movie or book reviews, in order to see if
the results could be influenced by the nature of the
corpus, allowing also further results for comparison
with other approaches and assessing the difficulty of
the task from a perspective of different domains.
