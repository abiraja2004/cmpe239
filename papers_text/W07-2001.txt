Abstract
This paper presents a first attempt of an
application-driven evaluation exercise of
WSD. We used a CLIR testbed from the
Cross Lingual Evaluation Forum. The ex-
pansion, indexing and retrieval strategies
where fixed by the organizers. The par-
ticipants had to return both the topics and
documents tagged with WordNet 1.6 word
senses. The organization provided training
data in the form of a pre-processed Semcor
which could be readily used by participants.
The task had two participants, and the orga-
nizer also provide an in-house WSD system
for comparison.
1 Introduction
Since the start of Senseval, the evaluation of Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) as a separate task is a
mature field, with both lexical-sample and all-words
tasks. In the first case the participants need to tag the
occurrences of a few words, for which hand-tagged
data has already been provided. In the all-words task
all the occurrences of open-class words occurring in
two or three documents (a few thousand words) need
to be disambiguated.
The community has long mentioned the neces-
sity of evaluating WSD in an application, in order
to check which WSD strategy is best, and more im-
portant, to try to show that WSD can make a differ-
ence in applications. The use of WSD in Machine
Translation has been the subject of some recent pa-
pers, but less attention has been paid to Information
Retrieval (IR).
With this proposal we want to make a first try to
define a task where WSD is evaluated with respect
to an Information Retrieval and Cross-Lingual Infor-
mation Retrieval (CLIR) exercise. From the WSD
perspective, this task will evaluate all-words WSD
systems indirectly on a real task. From the CLIR
perspective, this task will evaluate which WSD sys-
tems and strategies work best.
We are conscious that the number of possible con-
figurations for such an exercise is very large (in-
cluding sense inventory choice, using word sense in-
duction instead of disambiguation, query expansion,
WSD strategies, IR strategies, etc.), so this first edi-
tion focuses on the following:
? The IR/CLIR system is fixed.
? The expansion / translation strategy is fixed.
? The participants can choose the best WSD
strategy.
1
? The IR system is used as the upperbound for
the CLIR systems.
We think that it is important to start doing this
kind of application-driven evaluations, which might
shed light to the intricacies in the interaction be-
tween WSD and IR strategies. We see this as the
first of a series of exercises, and one outcome of this
task should be that both WSD and CLIR communi-
ties discuss together future evaluation possibilities.
This task has been organized in collabora-
tion with the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum
(CLEF1). The results will be analyzed in the CLEF-
2007 workshop, and a special track will be pro-
posed for CLEF-2008, where CLIR systems will
have the opportunity to use the annotated data
produced as a result of the Semeval-2007 task.
The task has a webpage with all the details at
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/semeval-clir.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the task with all the details regarding
datasets, expansion/translation, the IR/CLIR system
used, and steps for participation. Section 3 presents
the evaluation performed and the results obtained by
the participants. Finally, Section 4 draws the con-
clusions and mention the future work.
2 Description of the task
This is an application-driven task, where the appli-
cation is a fixed CLIR system. Participants disam-
biguate text by assigning WordNet 1.6 synsets and
the system will do the expansion to other languages,
index the expanded documents and run the retrieval
for all the languages in batch. The retrieval results
are taken as the measure for fitness of the disam-
biguation. The modules and rules for the expansion
and the retrieval will be exactly the same for all par-
ticipants.
We proposed two specific subtasks:
1. Participants disambiguate the corpus, the cor-
pus is expanded to synonyms/translations and
we measure the effects on IR/CLIR. Topics2 are
not processed.
1http://www.clef-campaign.org
2In IR topics are the short texts which are used by the sys-
tems to produce the queries. They usually provide extensive
information about the text to be searched, which can be used
both by the search engine and the human evaluators.
2. Participants disambiguate the topics per lan-
guage, we expand the queries to syn-
onyms/translations and we measure the effects
on IR/CLIR. Documents are not processed
The corpora and topics were obtained from the
ad-hoc CLEF tasks. The supported languages in the
topics are English and Spanish, but in order to limit
the scope of the exercise we decided to only use En-
glish documents. The participants only had to dis-
ambiguate the English topics and documents. Note
that most WSD systems only run on English text.
Due to these limitations, we had the following
evaluation settings:
IR with WSD of topics , where the participants
disambiguate the documents, the disam-
biguated documents are expanded to syn-
onyms, and the original topics are used for
querying. All documents and topics are in En-
glish.
IR with WSD of documents , where the partic-
ipants disambiguate the topics, the disam-
biguated topics are expanded and used for
querying the original documents. All docu-
ments and topics are in English.
CLIR with WSD of documents , where the partic-
ipants disambiguate the documents, the dis-
ambiguated documents are translated, and the
original topics in Spanish are used for query-
ing. The documents are in English and the top-
ics are in Spanish.
We decided to focus on CLIR for evaluation,
given the difficulty of improving IR. The IR results
are given as illustration, and as an upperbound of
the CLIR task. This use of IR results as a reference
for CLIR systems is customary in the CLIR commu-
nity (Harman, 2005).
2.1 Datasets
The English CLEF data from years 2000-2005 com-
prises corpora from ?Los Angeles Times? (year
1994) and ?Glasgow Herald? (year 1995) amounting
to 169,477 documents (579 MB of raw text, 4.8GB
in the XML format provided to participants, see Sec-
tion 2.3) and 300 topics in English and Spanish (the
topics are human translations of each other). The
relevance judgments were taken from CLEF. This
2
might have the disadvantage of having been pro-
duced by pooling the results of CLEF participants,
and might bias the results towards systems not using
WSD, specially for monolingual English retrieval.
We are considering the realization of a post-hoc
analysis of the participants results in order to ana-
lyze the effect on the lack of pooling.
Due to the size of the document collection, we de-
cided that the limited time available in the competi-
tion was too short to disambiguate the whole collec-
tion. We thus chose to take a sixth part of the corpus
at random, comprising 29,375 documents (874MB
in the XML format distributed to participants). Not
all topics had relevant documents in this 17% sam-
ple, and therefore only 201 topics were effectively
used for evaluation. All in all, we reused 21,797
relevance judgements that contained one of the doc-
uments in the 17% sample, from which 923 are pos-
itive3. For the future we would like to use the whole
collection.
2.2 Expansion and translation
For expansion and translation we used the publicly
available Multilingual Central Repository (MCR)
from the MEANING project (Atserias et al, 2004).
The MCR follows the EuroWordNet design, and
currently includes English, Spanish, Italian, Basque
and Catalan wordnets tightly connected through the
Interlingual Index (based on WordNet 1.6, but linked
to all other WordNet versions).
We only expanded (translated) the senses returned
by the WSD systems. That is, given a word like
?car?, it will be expanded to ?automobile? or ?railcar?
(and translated to ?auto? or ?vago?n? respectively) de-
pending on the sense in WN 1.6. If the systems re-
turns more than one sense, we choose the sense with
maximum weight. In case of ties, we expand (trans-
late) all. The participants could thus implicitly affect
the expansion results, for instance, when no sense
could be selected for a target noun, the participants
could either return nothing (or NOSENSE, which
would be equivalent), or all senses with 0 score. In
the first case no expansion would be performed, in
the second all senses would be expanded, which is
equivalent to full expansion. This fact will be men-
tioned again in Section 3.5.
3The overall figures are 125,556 relevance judgements for
the 300 topics, from which 5700 are positive
Note that in all cases we never delete any of the
words in the original text.
In addition to the expansion strategy used with the
participants, we tested other expansion strategies as
baselines:
noexp no expansion, original text
fullexp expansion (translation in the case of English
to Spanish expansion) to all synonyms of all
senses
wsd50 expansion to the best 50% senses as returned
by the WSD system. This expansion was tried
over the in-house WSD system of the organizer
only.
2.3 IR/CLIR system
The retrieval engine is an adaptation of the Twenty-
One search system (Hiemstra and Kraaij, 1998) that
was developed during the 90?s by the TNO research
institute at Delft (The Netherlands) getting good re-
sults on IR and CLIR exercises in TREC (Harman,
2005). It is now further developed by Irion technolo-
gies as a cross-lingual retrieval system (Vossen et al,
). For indexing, the TwentyOne system takes Noun
Phrases as an input. Noun Phases (NPs) are detected
using a chunker and a word form with POS lexicon.
Phrases outside the NPs are not indexed, as well as
non-content words (determiners, prepositions, etc.)
within the phrase.
The Irion TwentyOne system uses a two-stage re-
trieval process where relevant documents are first
extracted using a vector space matching and sec-
ondly phrases are matched with specific queries.
Likewise, the system is optimized for high-precision
phrase retrieval with short queries (1 up 5 words
with a phrasal structure as well). The system can be
stripped down to a basic vector space retrieval sys-
tem with an tf.idf metrics that returns documents for
topics up to a length of 30 words. The stripped-down
version was used for this task to make the retrieval
results compatible with the TREC/CLEF system.
The Irion system was also used for pre-
processing. The CLEF corpus and topics were con-
verted to the TwentyOne XML format, normalized,
and named-entities and phrasal structured detected.
Each of the target tokens was identified by an unique
identifier.
2.4 Participation
The participants were provided with the following:
3
1. the document collection in Irion XML format
2. the topics in Irion XML format
In addition, the organizers also provided some of
the widely used WSD features in a word-to-word
fashion4 (Agirre et al, 2006) in order to make partic-
ipation easier. These features were available for both
topics and documents as well as for all the words
with frequency above 10 in SemCor 1.6 (which can
be taken as the training data for supervised WSD
systems). The Semcor data is publicly available 5.
For the rest of the data, participants had to sign and
end user agreement.
The participants had to return the input files en-
riched with WordNet 1.6 sense tags in the required
XML format:
1. for all the documents in the collection
2. for all the topics
Scripts to produce the desired output from word-
to-word files and the input files were provided by
organizers, as well as DTD?s and software to check
that the results were conformant to the respective
DTD?s.
3 Evaluation and results
For each of the settings presented in Section 2 we
present the results of the participants, as well as
those of an in-house system presented by the orga-
nizers. Please refer to the system description papers
for a more complete description. We also provide
some baselines and alternative expansion (transla-
tion) strategies. All systems are evaluated accord-
ing to their Mean Average Precision 6 (MAP) as
computed by the trec eval software on the pre-
existing CLEF relevance-assessments.
3.1 Participants
The two systems that registered sent the results on
time.
PUTOP They extend on McCarthy?s predominant
sense method to create an unsupervised method
of word sense disambiguation that uses auto-
matically derived topics using Latent Dirichlet
4Each target word gets a file with all the occurrences, and
each occurrence gets the occurrence identifier, the sense tag (if
in training), and the list of features that apply to the occurrence.

Information retrieval
Allocation. Using topic-specific synset similar-
ity measures, they create predictions for each
word in each document using only word fre-
quency information. The disambiguation pro-
cess took aprox. 12 hours on a cluster of 48 ma-
chines (dual Xeons with 4GB of RAM). Note
that contrary to the specifications, this team
returned WordNet 2.1 senses, so we had to
map automatically to 1.6 senses (Daude et al,
2000).
UNIBA This team uses a a knowledge-based WSD
system that attempts to disambiguate all words
in a text by exploiting WordNet relations. The
main assumption is that a specific strategy for
each Part-Of-Speech (POS) is better than a sin-
gle strategy. Nouns are disambiguated basi-
cally using hypernymy links. Verbs are dis-
ambiguated according to the nouns surrounding
them, and adjectives and adverbs use glosses.
ORGANIZERS In addition to the regular partic-
ipants, and out of the competition, the orga-
nizers run a regular supervised WSD system
trained on Semcor. The system is based on
a single k-NN classifier using the features de-
scribed in (Agirre et al, 2006) and made avail-
able at the task website (cf. Section 2.4).
In addition to those we also present some com-
mon IR/CLIR baselines, baseline WSD systems, and
an alternative expansion:
noexp a non-expansion IR/CLIR baseline of the
documents or topics.
fullexp a full-expansion IR/CLIR baseline of the
documents or topics.
wsdrand a WSD baseline system which chooses a
sense at random. The usual expansion is ap-
plied.
1st a WSD baseline system which returns the sense
numbered as 1 in WordNet. The usual expan-
sion is applied.
wsd50 the organizer?s WSD system, where the 50%
senses of the word ranking according to the
WSD system are expanded. That is, instead of
expanding the single best sense, it expands the
best 50% senses.

second and third columns of Table 1 present the re-
sults when disambiguating the topics and the docu-
ments respectively. Non of the expansion techniques
improves over the baseline (no expansion).
Note that due to the limitation of the search en-
gine, long queries were truncated at 50 words, which
might explain the very low results of the full expan-
sion.
3.3 CLIR results
The last column of Table 1 shows the CLIR results
when expanding (translating) the disambiguated
documents. None of the WSD systems attains the
performance of full expansion, which would be the
baseline CLIR system, but the WSD of the organizer
gets close.
3.4 WSD results
In addition to the IR and CLIR results we also pro-
vide the WSD performance of the participants on
the Senseval 2 and 3 all-words task. The documents
from those tasks were included alongside the CLEF
documents, in the same formats, so they are treated
as any other document. In order to evaluate, we had
to map automatically all WSD results to the respec-
tive WordNet version (using the mappings in (Daude
et al, 2000) which are publicly available).
The results are presented in Table 2, where we can
see that the best results are attained by the organizers
WSD system.
3.5 Discussion
First of all, we would like to mention that the WSD
and expansion strategy, which is very simplistic, de-
grades the IR performance. This was rather ex-

pected, as the IR experiments had an illustration
goal, and are used for comparison with the CLIR
experiments. In monolingual IR, expanding the top-
ics is much less harmful than expanding the docu-
ments. Unfortunately the limitation to 50 words in
the queries might have limited the expansion of the
topics, which make the results rather unreliable. We
plan to fix this for future evaluations.
Regarding CLIR results, even if none of the WSD
systems were able to beat the full-expansion base-
line, the organizers system was very close, which is
quite encouraging due to the very simplistic expan-
sion, indexing and retrieval strategies used.
In order to better interpret the results, Table 3
shows the amount of words after the expansion in
each case. This data is very important in order to un-
derstand the behavior of each of the systems. Note
that UNIBA returns 3 synsets at most, and therefore
the wsd50 strategy (select the 50% senses with best
score) leaves a single synset, which is the same as
taking the single best system (wsdbest). Regarding
PUTOP, this system returned a single synset, and
therefore the wsd50 figures are the same as the ws-
dbest figures.
Comparing the amount of words for the two par-
ticipant systems, we see that UNIBA has the least
words, closely followed by PUTOP. The organizers
WSD system gets far more expanded words. The
explanation is that when the synsets returned by a
WSD system all have 0 weights, the wsdbest expan-
sion strategy expands them all. This was not explicit
in the rules for participation, and might have affected
the results.
A cross analysis of the result tables and the num-
ber of words is interesting. For instance, in the IR
exercise, when we expand documents, the results in

used with participants.
the third column of Table 1 show that the ranking for
the non-informed baselines is the following: best for
no expansion, second for random WSD, and third
for full expansion. These results can be explained
because of the amount of expansion: the more ex-
pansion the worst results. When more informed
WSD is performed, documents with more expansion
can get better results, and in fact the WSD system of
the organizers is the second best result from all sys-
tem and baselines, and has more words than the rest
(with exception of wsd50 and full expansion). Still,
the no expansion baseline is far from the WSD re-
sults.
Regarding the CLIR result, the situation is in-
verted, with the best results for the most productive
expansions (full expansion, random WSD and no ex-
pansion, in this order). For the more informed WSD
methods, the best results are again for the organizers
WSD system, which is very close to the full expan-
sion baseline. Even if wsd50 has more expanded
words wsdbest is more effective. Note the very high
results attained by random. These high results can
be explained by the fact that many senses get the
same translation, and thus for many words with few
translation, the random translation might be valid.
Still the wsdbest, 1st sense and wsd50 results get
better results.
4 Conclusions and future work
This paper presents the results of a preliminary at-
tempt of an application-driven evaluation exercise
of WSD in CLIR. The expansion, indexing and re-
trieval strategies proved too simplistic, and none of
the two participant systems and the organizers sys-
tem were able to beat the full-expansion baseline.
Due to efficiency reasons, the IRION system had
some of its features turned off. Still the results are
encouraging, as the organizers system was able to
get very close to the full expansion strategy with
much less expansion (translation).
For the future, a special track of CLEF-2008 will
leave the avenue open for more sophisticated CLIR
techniques. We plan to extend the WSD annotation
to all words in the CLEF English document collec-
tion, and we also plan to contact the best performing
systems of the SemEval all-words tasks to have bet-
ter quality annotations.
