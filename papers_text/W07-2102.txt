Abstract
This paper describes our system for the task
of extracting frame semantic structures in
SemEval?2007. The system architecture
uses two types of learning models in each
part of the task: Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME). De-
signed as a pipeline of classifiers, the seman-
tic parsing system obtained competitive pre-
cision scores on the test data.
1 Introduction
The SemEval?2007 task for extracting frame se-
mantic structures relies on the human annotated
data available in the FrameNet (FN) database. The
Berkeley FrameNet project (Baker et al, 1998) is
an ongoing effort of building a semantic lexicon for
English based on the theory of frame semantics. In
frame semantics, the meaning of words or word ex-
pressions, also called target words (TW), comprises
aspects of conceptual structures, or frames, that de-
scribe specific situations. The semantic roles, or
frame elements (FE), associated with a target word
are locally defined in the frame evoked by the tar-
get word. Currently, the FN lexicon includes more
than 135,000 sentences extracted from the British
National Corpus containing more than 6,100 target
words that evoke more than 825 semantic frames.
For this task, we extended our previous work at
Senseval-3 (Bejan et al, 2004) by (1) experiment-
ing with additional features, (2) adding new classifi-
cation sub-tasks to accomplish all the requirements,
and (3) integrating these sub-tasks into a pipeline ar-
chitecture.
2 System Description
Given a sentence, the frame semantic structure ex-
traction task consists of recognizing the word ex-
pressions that evoke semantic frames, assigning the
correct frame to them and, for each target word,
detecting and labeling the corresponding frame el-
ements properly. The task also requires the de-
termination of syntactic realizations associated to a
frame element, such as grammatical function (GF)
and phrase type (PT). The following illustrates a
sentence example annotated with frame elements to-
gether with their corresponding grammatical func-
tions and phrase types for the target word ?tie?:

To extract semantic structures similar to those il-
lustrated in the example we divide the SemEval?
2007 task into four sub-tasks: (1) target word frame
disambiguation (TWFD); (2) FE boundary detection
(FEBD); (3) GF label classification (GFLC) and (4)
FE label classification (FELC). The sub-tasks TWFD
and GFLC are natural extensions of the approach de-
scribed in (Bejan et al, 2004) for the task of se-
mantic role labeling at Senseval-03. We design ma-
chine learning classifiers specific for each of the four
sub-tasks and arrange them in a pipeline architecture
such that a classifier can use information predicted
by its previous classifiers. The system architecture
is illustrated in Figure 1. In the data processing step,
we parse each sentence into a syntactic tree using the
Collins parser and extract named entities using an in

ambiguation sub-task extracts features correspond-
ing to the constituent tied in order to predict the
right frame between the semantic frames that can be
evoked by this target word. In this figure, the correct
categories for each sub-task are shown in boldface.
The complete set of features extracted for all the
classification sub-tasks is illustrated in Figure 3.
These represent a subset of features used in previ-
ous works (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Florian et al,
2002; Surdeanu et al, 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004;
Bejan et al, 2004; Pradhan et al, 2005) for auto-
matic semantic role labeling and word sense disam-
biguation. Figure 3 also indicates whether or not a
feature is selected for a specific classification task.
In the remaining part of this section we describe
in detail each classification sub-task and the features
that have the most salient effect on improving the
corresponding classifiers.
2.1 Frame Disambiguation
In FrameNet, some target words can evoke multiple
semantic frames. In order to extract the semantic
structure of an ambiguous target word, the first step
is to assign the correct frame to the target word in
a given context. This task is similar with the word
sense disambiguation task.
We select from the FN lexicon 556 target words
that evoke at least two semantic frames and have at
least five sentences annotated for each frame, and
assemble a multi-class classifier for each ambiguous
target word. As described in Figure 3, for this task
we extract features used in word sense disambigua-
tion (Florian et al, 2002), lexical features of the tar-
get word, and NAMED ENTITY FLAGS associated
with the root node in a syntactic parse tree. For
the rest of the ambiguous target words that have less
than five sentences annotated we randomly choose a
frame as being the correct frame in a given context.
2.2 Frame Element Identification
The idea of splitting the automatic semantic role la-
beling task into FE boundary detection and FE label
classification was first proposed in (Gildea and Ju-
rafsky, 2002) and then adopted by other works in
this task. The problem of detecting the FE bound-
aries is cast as the problem of deciding whether or
not a constituent is a valid candidate for a FE.

Figure 3: Feature set for extracting frame semantic structures.
We consider a binary classifier over the entire FN
data and extract features for each constituent from a
syntactic parse tree. Because this experimental setup
allows training the binary classifier on a large set of
examples, the best feature combination consists of
a restrained number of features. Most of these fea-
tures are from the set proposed by (Gildea and Juraf-
sky, 2002). Another feature that improved the pre-
diction of FE boundaries in every feature selection
experiment is the FRAME feature. Since the frame
disambiguation is executed before the FE boundary
detection in the pipeline architecture, we can use the
FRAME feature at this step. This feature helps the
binary classifier distinguish between frame element
structures from different semantic frames.
2.3 Grammatical Function Classification
Once we identify the candidate boundaries for frame
elements, the next step is to assign the grammat-
ical functions to these boundaries. In FrameNet,
the grammatical functions represent the manner in
which the frame elements satisfy grammatical con-
straints with respect to the target word.
For this task we train a multi-class classifier over
the entire lexicon to predict seven categories of GFs
that exist in FN. In addition, we assign the NULL
category for those FEs that double as target words.
The features are extracted only for the constituents
that are identified as FEs in the previous FE bound-
ary identification sub-task. The best feature set in
this phase includes the features proposed by (Gildea
and Jurafsky, 2002) and the FRAME feature.
2.4 Frame Element Classification
The task of FE classification is to assign FE labels to
every constituent identified as FE. In order to predict
the frame elements, which are locally defined for
each semantic frame, we built 489 multi-class clas-
sifiers, where each classifier corresponds to a frame
in FrameNet. This partitioning of the FN lexicon has
the advantage of increasing the overall classification
performance and efficiently learning the frame ele-
ments labels. On the other hand, this approach suf-
fers from the lack of annotated data in some frames
and hence it requires using a large set of features.
The advantage of designing the classifiers in a
pipeline architecture is best illustrated in this sub-
task. Some of the most effective features for FE
classification are extracted using information from
previous sub-tasks: FRAME feature is made avail-
able by the TWFD sub-task, CONSTITUENTS NUM-
BER and CONSTITUENTS LIST are made available
by the FEBD sub-task, and GF and GF LIST are
made available by the GFLC sub-task.

3 Experimental Results
We report experimental results on all four classi-
fication sub-tasks. In our experiments we trained
two types of classification models for each sub-task:
SVM and ME. In order to optimize the performance
measure of each sub-task and to find the best config-
uration of classification models we used 20% of the
sub-tasks training data as validation data. Table 1
lists the best configuration of classification models
as well as the best sub-task results when running
the experiments on the validation data. For frame
disambiguation, we obtained 76.71% accuracy com-
pared to a baseline of 60.72% accuracy that always
predicts the most annotated frame for each of the
556 target words. The results for GFLC and FELC
sub-tasks listed in Table 1 were achieved by using
gold FE boundaries.

Table 1: Task results on the validation set.
The SemEval?2007 organizers provided fully an-
notated training files, a scorer to evaluate these
training files, and testing files containing flat sen-
tences. In the evaluation process, a semantic depen-
dency graph corresponding to a fully system anno-
tated sentence is created and then matched with its
gold dependency graph. The matching process not
only evaluates every semantic structure of a target
word, but also considers frame-to-frame and FE-to-
FE graph relations between the semantic structures.
In addition, various scoring options were consid-
ered: exact or partial frame matching, partial credit
for evaluating the named entities, evaluation of the
flat frame elements labels, and an option for match-
ing only the frames in evaluation. The evaluation for
flat frame elements labels is similar with the evalu-
ation performed at Senseval-3. The only difference
is that for this scorer the FE boundaries must match
exactly.
In Table 2, we present the averaged precision,
recall and F1 measures for evaluating the seman-
tic dependency graphs and detecting the semantic
frames on the testing files. The ?Options? col-
umn represents the configuration parameters of the
scorer: (E)xact/(P)artial frame matching, seman-
tic (D)ependency or (L)abels only evaluation, and
(Y)es/(N)o named entity evaluation.

Although the system achieved good precision
scores on the test data, the recall values caused the
system to obtain unsatisfactory F1-measure values.
We expect that the recall will increase by consid-
ering various heuristics for a better mapping of the
frame elements to constituents in parse trees.
4 Conclusions
We described a system that participated in SemEval?
2007 for the task of extracting frame semantic struc-
tures. We showed that a pipeline architecture of the
SVM and ME classifiers as well as an adequate se-
lection of the classification models can improve the
performance measures of each sub-task.
