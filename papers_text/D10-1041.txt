Abstract
For resource-limited language pairs, coverage
of the test set by the parallel corpus is an
important factor that affects translation qual-
ity in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary
words; 2) the same information in an input
sentence can be expressed in different ways,
while current phrase-based SMT systems can-
not automatically select an alternative way
to transfer the same information. Therefore,
given limited data, in order to facilitate trans-
lation from the input side, this paper pro-
poses a novel method to reduce the transla-
tion difficulty using source-side lattice-based
paraphrases. We utilise the original phrases
from the input sentence and the correspond-
ing paraphrases to build a lattice with esti-
mated weights for each edge to improve trans-
lation quality. Compared to the baseline sys-
tem, our method achieves relative improve-
ments of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms
of BLEU score on small, medium and large-
scale English-to-Chinese translation tasks re-
spectively. The results show that the proposed
method is effective not only for resource-
limited language pairs, but also for resource-
sufficient pairs to some extent.
1 Introduction
In recent years, statistical MT systems have been
easy to develop due to the rapid explosion in data
availability, especially parallel data. However, in
reality there are still many language pairs which
lack parallel data, such as Urdu?English, Chinese?
Italian, where large amounts of speakers exist for
both languages; of course, the problem is far worse
for pairs such as Catalan?Irish. For such resource-
limited language pairs, sparse amounts of parallel
data would cause the word alignment to be inac-
curate, which would in turn lead to an inaccurate
phrase alignment, and bad translations would re-
sult. Callison-Burch et al (2006) argue that lim-
ited amounts of parallel training data can lead to the
problem of low coverage in that many phrases en-
countered at run-time are not observed in the train-
ing data and so their translations will not be learned.
Thus, in recent years, research on addressing the
problem of unknown words or phrases has become
more and more evident for resource-limited lan-
guage pairs.
Callison-Burch et al (2006) proposed a novel
method which substitutes a paraphrase for an un-
known source word or phrase in the input sentence,
and then proceeds to use the translation of that para-
phrase in the production of the target-language re-
sult. Their experiments showed that by translating
paraphrases a marked improvement was achieved in
coverage and translation quality, especially in the
case of unknown words which previously had been
left untranslated. However, on a large-scale data set,
they did not achieve improvements in terms of auto-
matic evaluation.
Nakov (2008) proposed another way to use para-
phrases in SMT. He generates nearly-equivalent syn-
tactic paraphrases of the source-side training sen-
tences, then pairs each paraphrased sentence with
the target translation associated with the original
sentence in the training data. Essentially, this
method generates new training data using para-
phrases to train a new model and obtain more useful
420
phrase pairs. However, he reported that this method
results in bad system performance. By contrast,
real improvements can be achieved by merging the
phrase tables of the paraphrase model and the orig-
inal model, giving priority to the latter. Schroeder
et al (2009) presented the use of word lattices
for multi-source translation, in which the multiple
source input texts are compiled into a compact lat-
tice, over which a single decoding pass is then per-
formed. This lattice-based method achieved positive
results across all data conditions.
In this paper, we propose a novel method us-
ing paraphrases to facilitate translation, especially
for resource-limited languages. Our method does
not distinguish unknown words in the input sen-
tence, but uses paraphrases of all possible words
and phrases in the source input sentence to build a
source-side lattice to provide a diverse and flexible
list of source-side candidates to the SMT decoder
so that it can search for a best path and deliver the
translation with the highest probability. In this case,
we neither need to change the phrase table, nor add
new features in the log-linear model, nor add new
sentences in the training data.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we define the ?translation diffi-
culty? from the perspective of the source side, and
then examine how well the test set is covered by
the phrase table and the parallel training data . Sec-
tion 3 describes our paraphrase lattice method and
discusses how to set the weights for the edges in the
lattice network. In Section 4, we report comparative
experiments conducted on small, medium and large-
scale English-to-Chinese data sets. In Section 5,
we analyse the influence of our paraphrase lattice
method. Section 6 concludes and gives avenues for
future work.
2 What Makes Translation Difficult?
2.1 Translation Difficulty
We use the term ?translation difficulty? to explain
how difficult it is to translate the source-side sen-
tence in three respects:
? The OOV rates of the source sentences in the
test set (Callison-Burch et al, 2006).
? Translatability of a known phrase in the input
sentence. Some particular grammatical struc-
tures on the source side cannot be directly
translated into the corresponding structures on
the target side. Nakov (2008) presents an ex-
ample showing how hard it is to translate an En-
glish construction into Spanish. Assume that an
English-to-Spanish SMT system has an entry
in its phrase table for ?inequality of income?,
but not for ?income inequality?. He argues that
the latter phrase is hard to translate into Span-
ish where noun compounds are rare: the correct
translation in this case requires a suitable Span-
ish preposition and a reordering, which are hard
for the system to realize properly in the target
language (Nakov, 2008).
? Consistency between the reference and the
target-side sentence in the training corpus.
Nakov (2008) points out that if the target-side
sentence in the parallel corpus is inconsistent
with the reference of the test set, then in some
cases, a test sentence might contain pieces that
are equivalent, but syntactically different from
the phrases learned in training, which might re-
sult in practice in a missed opportunity for a
high-quality translation. In this case, if we use
paraphrases for these pieces of text, then we
might improve the opportunity for the transla-
tion to approach the reference, especially in the
case where only one reference is available.
2.2 Coverage
As to the first aspect ? coverage ? we argue that
the coverage rate of the new words or unknown
words are more and more becoming a ?bottleneck?
for resource-limited languages. Furthermore, cur-
rent SMT systems, either phrase-based (Koehn et al,
2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based (Zollmann and
Venugopal, 2006), use phrases as the fundamental
translation unit, so how much the phrase table and
training data can cover the test set is an important
factor which influences the translation quality. Ta-
ble 1 shows the statistics of the coverage of the test
set on English-to-Chinese FBIS data, where we can
see that the coverage of unigrams is very high, es-
pecially when the data is increased to the medium
size (200K), where unigram coverage is greater than
90%. Based on the observations of the unknown un-

occur in the Phrase Table; ?Corpus? indicates the number of phrases of the Test Set appearing in the parallel corpus;
?in PT? indicates the coverage of the phrases in the Test Set by the phrase table and correspondingly ?in Corpus?
represents the coverage of the phrases in the Test Set by the Parallel Corpus.
igrams, we found that most are named entities (NEs)
such as person name, location name, etc. From the
bigram phrases, the coverage rates begin to signifi-
cantly decline. It can also be seen that phrases con-
taining more than 5 words rarely appear either in the
phrase table or in the parallel corpus, which indi-
cates that data sparseness is severe for long phrases.
Even if the size of the corpus is significantly in-
creased (e.g. from 20K to 200K), the coverage of
long phrases is still quite low.
With respect to these three aspects of the transla-
tion difficulty, especially for data-limited language
pairs, we propose a more effective method to make
use of the paraphrases to facilitate translation pro-
cess.
3 Paraphrase Lattice for Input Sentences
In this Section, we propose a novel method to em-
ploy paraphrases to reduce the translation difficulty
and in so doing increase the translation quality.
3.1 Motivation
Our idea to build a paraphrase lattice for SMT is in-
spired by the following points:
? Handling unknown words is a challenging issue
for SMT, and using paraphrases is an effective
way to facilitate this problem (Callison-Burch
et al, 2006);
? The method of paraphrase substitution does not
show any significant improvement, especially
on a large-scale data set in terms of BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2002) scores (Callison-Burch et
al., 2006);
? Building a paraphrase lattice might provide
more translation options to the decoder so that
it can flexibly search for the best path.
The major contributions of our method are:
? We consider all N -gram phrases rather than
only unknown phrases in the test set, where
{1 <= N <= 10};
? We utilise lattices rather than simple substitu-
tion to facilitate the translation process;
? We propose an empirical weight estimation
method to set weights for edges in the word lat-
tice, which is detailed in Section 3.4.
3.2 Paraphrase Acquisition
Paraphrases are alternative ways to express the same
or similar meaning given a certain original word,
phrase or segment. The paraphrases used in our
method are generated from the parallel corpora
based on the algorithm in (Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005), in which paraphrases are identified
422
by pivoting through phrases in another language.
In this algorithm, the foreign language translations
of an English phrase are identified, all occurrences
of those foreign phrases are found, and all English
phrases that they translate as are treated as potential
paraphrases of the original English phrase (Callison-
Burch et al, 2006). A paraphrase has a probability
p(e2|e1) which is defined as in (2):
p(e2|e1) =
?
f
p(f |e1)p(e2|f) (1)
where the probability p(f |e1) is the probability that
the original English phrase e1 translates as a particu-
lar phrase f in the other language, and p(e2|f) is the
probability that the candidate paraphrase e2 trans-
lates as the foreign language phrase.
p(e2|f) and p(f |e1) are defined as the transla-
tion probabilities which can be calculated straight-
forwardly using maximum likelihood estimation by
counting how often the phrases e and f are aligned
in the parallel corpus as in (2) and (3):
p(e2|f) ?
count(e2, f)
?
e2 count(e2, f)
(2)
p(f |e1) ?
count(f, e1)
?
f count(f, e1)
(3)
3.3 Construction of Paraphrase Lattice
To present paraphrase options to the PB-SMT de-
coder, lattices with paraphrase options are con-
structed to enrich the source-language sentences.
The construction process takes advantage of the cor-
respondence between detected paraphrases and po-
sitions of the original words in the input sentence,
then creates extra edges in the lattices to allow the
decoder to consider paths involving the paraphrase
words.
An toy example is illustrated in Figure 1: given
a sequence of words {w1, . . . , wN} as the input,
two phrases ? = {?1, . . . , ?p} and ? = {?1, . . . , ?q}
are detected as paraphrases for S1 = {wx, . . . , wy}
(1 ? x ? y ? N ) and S2 = {wm, . . . , wn}
(1 ? m ? n ? N ) respectively. The following
steps are taken to transform them into word lattices:
1. Transform the original source sentence into
word lattices. N + 1 nodes (?k, 0 ? k ? N )

Figure 1: An example of lattice-based paraphrases for an
input sentence
are created, and N edges (referred to as ?ORG-
E? edges) labeled with wi (1 ? i ? N ) are
generated to connect them sequentially.
2. Generate extra nodes and edges for each of the
paraphrases. Taking ? as an example, firstly,
p ? 1 nodes are created, and then p edges
(referred as ?NEW-E? edges) labeled with ?j
(1 ? j ? p) are generated to connect node
?x?1, p? 1 nodes and ?y?1.
Via step 2, word lattices are generated by adding
new nodes and edges coming from paraphrases.
Note that to build word lattices, paraphrases with
multi-words are broken into word sequences, and
each of the words produces one extra edge in the
word lattices as shown in the bottom part in Figure 1.
Figure 2 shows an example of constructing the
word lattice for an input sentence which is from the
test set used in our experiments.1 The top part in
Figure 2 represents nodes (double-line circles) and
edges (solid lines) that are constructed by the orig-
inal words from the input sentence, while the bot-
tom part in Figure 2 indicates the final word lattice
with the addition of new nodes (single-line circles)
and new edges (dashed lines) which come from the
paraphrases. We can see that the paraphrase lattice
increases the diversity of the source phrases so that it
can provide more flexible translation options during
the decoding process.
1Figure 2 contains paths that are duplicates except for the
weights. We plan to handle this in future work.

3.4 Weight Estimation
Estimating and normalising the weight for each edge
in the word lattice is a challenging issue when the
edges come from different sources. In this section,
we propose an empirical method to set the weights
for the edges by distinguishing the original (?ORG-
E?) and new (?NEW-E?) edges in the lattices. The
aim is to utilize the original sentences as the ref-
erences to weight the edges from paraphrases, so
that decoding paths going through ?ORG-E? edges
will tend to have higher scores than those which use
?NEW-E? ones. The assumption behind this is that
the paraphrases are alternatives for the original sen-
tences, so decoding paths going though them ought
to be penalised.
Therefore, for all the ?ORG-E? edges, their
weights in the lattice are set to 1.0 as the reference.
Thus, in the log-linear model, decoding paths going
though these edges are not penalised because they
do not come from the paraphrases.
By contrast, ?NEW-E? are divided into two
groups for the calculation of weights:
? For ?NEW-E? edges which are outgoing edges
of the lattice nodes that come from the original
sentences, the probabilities p(es|ei)2 of their
2es indicates the source phrase S, ei represents one of the
corresponding paraphrases are utilised to pro-
duce empirical weights. Supposing that a set of
paraphrases X = {x1, . . . , xk} start at node A
which comes from the original sentence, so that
X are sorted descendingly based on the proba-
bilities p(es|ei), their corresponding edges for
node A are G = {g1, . . . , gk}, then the weights
are calculated as in (4):
w(ei) =
1
k + i
(1 <= i <= k) (4)
where k is a predefined parameter to trade off
between decoding speed and the number of
potential paraphrases being considered. Thus,
once a decoding path goes though one of these
edges, it will be penalised according to its para-
phrase probabilities.
? For all other ?NEW-E? edges, their weights
are set to 1.0, because the paraphrase penalty
has been counted in their preceding ?NEW-E?
edges.
Figure 2 illustrates the weight estimation results.
Nodes coming from the original sentences are drawn
in double-line circles (e.g. nodes 0 to 7), while
paraphrases of S.
424
nodes created from paraphrases are shown in single-
line circles (e.g. nodes 8 to 10). ?ORG-E? edges are
drawn in solid lines and ?NEW-E? edges are shown
using dashed lines. As specified previously, ?ORG-
E? edges are all weighted by 1.0 (e.g. edge labeled
?the? from node 0 to 1). By contrast, ?NEW-E?
edges in the first group are weighted by equation
(4) (e.g. edges in dashed lines start from node 0
to node 2 and 8), while others in the second group
are weighted by 1.0 (e.g. edge labeled ?training?
from node 8 to 2). Note that penalties of the paths
going through paraphrases are counted by equation
(4), which is represented by the weights of ?NEW-
E? edges in the first group. For example, starting
from node 2, paths going to node 9 and 10 are pe-
nalised because lattice weights are also considered
in the log-linear model. However, other edges do
not imply penalties since their weights are set to 1.0.
The reason to set al weights for the ?ORG-E?
edges to a uniform weight (e.g. 1.0) instead of a
lower empirical weight is to avoid excessive penal-
ties for the original words. For example, in Fig-
ure 2, the original edge from node 3 to 4 (con-
tinue) has a weight of 1.0, so the paths going though
the original edges from node 2 to 4 (will continue)
have a higher lattice score (1.0 ? 1.0 = 1.0) than
the paths going through the edges of paraphrases
(e.g. will resume (score: 0.125 ? 1.0 = 0.125) and
will go (score: 0.11 ? 1.0 = 0.11)), or any other
mixed paths that goes through original edges and
paraphrase edges, such as will continuous (score:
1.0 ? 0.125 = 0.125). The point is that we should
have more trust when translating the original words,
but if we penalise (set weights < 1.0) the ?ORG-
E? edges whenever there is a paraphrase for them,
then when considering the context of the lattice,
paraphrases will be favoured systematically. That is
why we just penalise the ?NEW-E? edges in the first
group and set other weights to 1.0.
As to unknown words in the input sentence, even
if we give them a prioritised weight, they would
be severely penalised in the decoding process. So
we do not need to distinguish unknown words when
building and weighting the paraphrase lattice.
4 Experiments
4.1 System and Data Preparation
For our experiments, we use Moses (Koehn et al,
2007) as the baseline system which can support
lattice decoding. We also realise a paraphrase
substitution-based system (Para-Sub)3 based on the
method in (Callison-Burch, 2006) to compare with
the baseline system and our proposed paraphrase
lattice-based (Lattice) system.
The alignment is carried out by GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) and then we symmetrized the word
alignment using the grow-diag-final heuristic. The
maximum phrase length is 10 words. Parameter tun-
ing is performed using Minimum Error Rate Train-
ing (Och, 2003).
The experiments are conducted on English-to-
Chinese translation. In order to fully compare our
proposed method with the baseline and the ?Para-
Sub? system, we perform the experiments on three
different sizes of training data: 20K, 200K and 2.1
million pairs of sentences. The former two sizes of
data are derived from FBIS,4 and the latter size of
data consists of part of HK parallel corpus,5 ISI par-
allel data,6 other news data and parallel dictionar-
ies from LDC. All the language models are 5-gram
which are trained on the monolingual part of parallel
data.
The development set (devset) and the test set for
experiments using 20K and 200K data sets are ran-
domly extracted from the FBIS data. Each set in-
cludes 1,200 sentences and each source sentence
has one reference. For the 2.1 million data set, we
use a different devset and test set in order to verify
whether our proposed method can work on a lan-
guage pair with sufficient resources. The devset is
the NIST 2005 Chinese-English current set which
has only one reference for each source sentence and
the test set is the NIST 2003 English-to-Chinese
current set which contains four references for each
source sentence. All results are reported in BLEU
and TER (Snover et al, 2006) scores.
3We use ?Para-Sub? to represent their system in the rest of
this paper.

The paraphrase data set used in our lattice-based
and the ?Para-Sub? systems is same which is de-
rived from the ?Paraphrase Phrase Table?7 of TER-
Plus (Snover et al, 2009). The parameter k in equa-
tion 4 is set to 7.
4.2 Paraphrase Filtering
The more edges there are in a lattice, the more
complicated the decoding is in the search process.
Therefore, in order to reduce the complexity of the
lattice and increase decoding speed, we must fil-
ter out some potential noise in the paraphrase table.
Two measures are taken to optimise the paraphrases
when building a paraphrase lattice:
? Firstly, we filter out all the paraphrases whose
probability is less than 0.01;
? Secondly, given a source-side input sentence,
we retrieve all possible paraphrases and their
probabilities for source-side phrases which ap-
pear in the paraphrase table. Then we remove
the paraphrases which are not occurred in the
?phrase table? of the SMT system. This mea-
sure intends to avoid adding new ?unknown
words? to the source-side sentence. After
this measure, we can acquire the final para-
phrases which can be denoted as a quadru-
ple < SEN ID,Span, Para, Prob >, where
?SEN ID? indicates the ID of the input sen-
tence, ?Span? represents the span of the source-
side phrase in the original input sentence,
?Para? indicates the paraphrase of the source-
side phrase, and ?Prob? represents the probabil-
ity between the source-side phrase and its para-
phrase, which is used to set the weight of the
edge in the lattice. The quadruple is used to
construct the weighted lattice.

4.3 Experimental Results
The experimental results conducted on small and
medium-sized data sets are shown in Table 2. The
95% confidence intervals (CI) for BLEU scores are
independently computed on each of three systems,
while the ?pair-CI 95%? are computed relative to
the baseline system only for ?Para-Sub? and ?Lat-
tice? systems. All the significance tests use boot-
strap and paired-bootstrap resampling normal ap-
proximation methods (Zhang and Vogel, 2004).8
Improvements are considered to be significant if the
left boundary of the confidence interval is larger
than zero in terms of the ?pair-CI 95%?. It can
be seen that 1) our ?Lattice? system outperforms
the baseline by 1.02 and 1.6 absolute (7.07% and
6.78% relative) BLEU points in terms of the 20K
and 200K data sets respectively, and our system also
decreases the TER scores by 2.24 and 1.19 (2.97%
and 1.87% relative) points than the baseline system.
In terms of the ?pair-CI 95%?, the left boundaries
for 20K and 200K data are respectively ?+0.74? and
?+1.19?, which indicate that the ?Lattice? system is
significantly better than the baseline system on these
two data sets. 2) The ?Para-Sub? system performs
slightly better (0.36 absolute BLEU points) than the
baseline system on the 20K data set, but slightly
worse (0.19 absolute BLEU points) than the baseline
on the 200K data set, which indicates that the para-
phrase substitution method used in (Callison-Burch
et al, 2006) does not work on resource-sufficient
data sets. In terms of the ?pair-CI 95%?, the left
boundary for 20K data is ?+0.13?, which indicates
that it is significantly better than the baseline sys-
tem, while the left boundary is ?-0.46? for 200K
data, which indicates that the ?Para-Sub? system
is significantly worse than the baseline system. 3)

which shows that our method is effective and consis-
tent on different sizes of data.
In order to verify our method on large-scale
data, we also perform experiments on 2.1 million
sentence-pairs of English-to-Chinese data as de-
scribed in Section 4.1. The results are shown in Ta-
ble 3. From Table 3, it can be seen that the ?Lattice?
system achieves an improvement of 0.51 absolute
(3.63% relative) BLEU points and a decrease of 1.6
absolute (2.14% relative) TER points compared to
the baseline. In terms of the ?pair-CI 95%?, the left
boundary for the ?Lattice? system is ?+0.15? which
indicates that it is significantly better than the base-
line system in terms of BLEU. Interestingly, in our
experiment, the ?Para-Sub? system also outperforms
the baseline on those three automatic metrics. How-
ever, in terms of the ?pair-CI 95%?, the left bound-
ary for the ?Para-Sub? system is ?-0.18? which indi-
cates that it is not significantly better than the base-
line system in terms of BLEU. The results also show
that our proposed method is effective and consistent
even on a large-scale data set.
It also can be seen that the improvement on 2.1
million sentence-pairs is less than that of the 20K
and 200K data sets. That is, as the size of the train-
ing data increases, the problems of data sparseness
decrease, so that the coverage of the test set by the
parallel corpus will correspondingly increase. In this
case, the role of paraphrases in decoding becomes a
little weaker. On the other hand, it might become a
kind of noise to interfere with the exact translation
of the original source-side phrases when decoding.
Therefore, our proposed method may be more ap-
propriate for language pairs with limited resources.
5 Analysis
5.1 Coverage of Paraphrase Test Set
The coverage rate of the test set by the phrase ta-
ble is an important factor that could influence the
translation result, so in this section we examine the
characteristics of the updated test set that adds in the
paraphrases. We take the 200K data set to examine
the coverage issue. Table 4 is an illustration to com-
pare the new coverage and the old coverage (without
paraphrases) on medium sized training data.

10 40,002 135 0.34 0.34
Table 4: The coverage of the paraphrase-added test set by
the phrase table on medium size of the training data.
From Table 4, we can see that the coverage of un-
igrams, bigrams, trigrams and 4-grams goes up by
about 5%, 10%, 5% and 1%, while from 5-grams
there is only a slight or no increase in coverage.
These results show that 1) most of the paraphrases
that are added in are lower-order n-grams; 2) the
paraphrases can increase the coverage of the input
by handling the unknown words to some extent.
However, we observed that most untranslated
words in the ?Para-Sub? and ?Lattice? systems are
still NEs, which shows that in our paraphrase table,
there are few paraphrases for the NEs. Therefore,
to further improve the translation quality using para-
phrases, we also need to acquire the paraphrases for
NEs to increase the coverage of unknown words.

5.2 Analysis on Translation Results
In this section, we give an example to show the ef-
fectiveness of using paraphrase lattices to deal with
unknown words. The example is evaluated accord-
ing to both automatic evaluation and human evalua-
tion at sentence level.
See Figure 3 as an illustration of how the
paraphrase-based systems process unknown words.
According to the word alignments between the
source-side sentence and the reference, the word
?disarmed? is translated into two Chinese words ??
?? and ????. These two Chinese words are dis-
continuous in the reference, so it is difficult for the
PB-SMT system to correctly translate the single En-
glish word into a discontinuous Chinese phrase. In
fact in this example, ?disarmed? is an unknownword
and it is kept untranslated in the result of the base-
line system. In the ?Para-Sub? system, it is trans-
lated into ?`? based on a paraphrase pair PP1 =
?disarmed ? disarmament ? 0.087? and its transla-
tion pair T1 = ?disarmament ? `?. The number
?0.087? is the probability p1 that indicates to what
extent these two words are paraphrases. It can be
seen that although ?`? is quite different from the
meaning of ?disarmed?, it is understandable for hu-
man in some sense. In the ?Lattice? system, the
word ?disarmed? is translated into three Chinese
words ?: / ??? based on a paraphrase pair
PP2 = ?disarmed ? demilitarized ? 0.099? and its
translation pair T2 = ?demilitarized ? : / ?
??. The probability p2 is slightly greater than p1.
We argue that the reason that the ?Lattice? system
selects PP2 and T2 rather than PP1 and T1 is be-
cause of the weight estimation in the lattice. That
is, PP2 is more prioritised, while PP1 is more pe-
nalised based on equation (4).
From the viewpoint of human evaluation, the
paraphrase pair PP2 is more appropriate than PP1,
and the translation T2 is more similar to the origi-
nal meaning than T1. The sentence-level automatic
evaluation scores for this example in terms of BLEU
and TER metrics are shown in Table 5.
SYS BLEU TER
Baseline 20.33 66.67
Para-Sub 21.78 53.33
Lattice 23.51 53.33
Table 5: Comparison on sentence-level scores in terms of
BLEU and TER metrics.
The BLEU score of the ?Lattice? system is much
higher than the baseline, and the TER score is quite
a bit lower than the baseline. Therefore, from the
viewpoint of automatic evaluation, the translation
from the ?Lattice? system is also better than those
from the baseline and ?Para-Sub? systems.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed a novel method using
paraphrase lattices to facilitate the translation pro-
cess in SMT. Given an input sentence, our method
firstly discovers all possible paraphrases from a
paraphrase database for N -grams (1 <= N <= 10)
in the test set, and then filters out the paraphrases
which do not appear in the phrase table in order to
avoid adding new unknown words on the input side.
We then use the original words and the paraphrases
to build a word lattice, and set the weights to priori-
tise the original edges and penalise the paraphrase
edges. Finally, we import the lattice into the de-
coder to perform lattice decoding. The experiments
are conducted on English-to-Chinese translation us-
ing the FBIS data set with small and medium-sized
amounts of data, and on a large-scale corpus of 2.1
428
million sentence pairs. We also performed compar-
ative experiments for the baseline, the ?Para-Sub?
system and our paraphrase lattice-based system. The
experimental results show that our proposed system
significantly outperforms the baseline and the ?Para-
Sub? system, and the effectiveness is consistent on
the small, medium and large-scale data sets.
As for future work, firstly we plan to propose a
pruning algorithm for the duplicate paths in the lat-
tice, which will track the edge generation with re-
spect to the path span, and thus eliminate duplicate
paths. Secondly, we plan to experiment with another
feature function in the log-linear model to discount
words derived from paraphrases, and use MERT to
assign an appropriate weight to this feature function.
