Position Paper on Appropriate Audio/Visual Turing Test

1. Introduction 
Dr. Hugh Loebner in his 1994 article in 
Communications \[1\] makes the statement regarding 
future LP competitions, "the winner of the Loebner 
Grand Prize must develop a computer with associated 
hardware that can respond 'intelligently' toaudio visual 
input in the manner that a human would .... Turing wrote, 
'The question and answer method seems suitable for 
introducing any one of the fields of human endeavor that 
we wish to include.' Well, I would like to ask questions 
about images and pattern recognition. If the computer 
answers appropriately it is intelligent." 
Some have said that requiring competitors to submit 
their programs to this kind of audio/visual interrogation 
is going overboard for what AI and robotics technology 
are prepared to offer \[2\]. The audio/visual requirement 
may prevent competitors from achieving the Loebner 
Grand Prize in the next ten years (yet I doubt it would 
have to take that long). However, observe how successful 
the scientists at Carnegie Mellon were able to be with the 
Navlab automated riving project in ten years \[3\]. 
Improved technologies for object and speech recognition 
(major component parts of the imagined 
program/hardware) are continuely being developed \[4\]. 
Little work has been done to consolidate neural 
recogition technologies and computational linguistics, to 
my knowledge \[5\]. Still, I believe that he most uncharted 
ground remains with determining sofrware requirements 
for passing the conventional Turing Test. The 'thinking' 
element which should allow a TT to be successfully 
passed is still largely unknown; i.e. the modeling of 
executive cognitive functions. 
2. A Matter of Degree 
The question arises, though, as to how well sighted and 
acute of hearing does a machine need to be to qualify for 
the Loehner Prize? Drawing on an icon from science 
fiction, it seems to me that the intention of Loebner's 
audio/visual Turing Test is to identify amachine which is 
in the likeness of Author C. Clark's HAL. But does the 
Loebner Prize winner's entrant need to be in the state of 
perfection HAL was portrayed in in 20017 I believe an 
initial success at linguistically identifying the quality of 
various simple sights and sounds would be 
groudbreaking. On the other hand, the principle of 
Turing's imitation game is that the interviewer is 
prevented from distinguishing a machine's responses 
from a human's responses. 
3. Possible Methods 
There are several ways one might test for audial and 
visual comprehension. One technique would be to 
administer children's intelligence tests to computers. 
Such as an adaptation of the WPPSI test (Wechsler Pre- 
school and Primary Scales of Intelligence), which 
requests linguistic answers to sight-vocabulary, object 
memory, and object relationship (e.g. which is larger) 
questions. Such a visually focused IQ test adaptation 
would not only test a machine's object identification 
skills, but also it's cognitive skills. 
David Powers has recommended t sting the machines 
ability to discuss objects of the judges choice. The 
objects would be placed at a given location, and the 
interviewee would have the chance to examine itbefore 
and during the interview. A similar arrangement could 
conceivably be used to test audial comprehension. A 
sound could be played and the interviewee asked to 
describe it. I would like to register support for a test after 
the manner which David Powers describes, believing that 
it would be feasible to engineer for and easy to 
administer. 
4. Multimedia 
One question looms large, though. Whether the audio 
and visual testing will be done discretely or together. 
Rather then separate the tests a single test could be 
administered with a noise making object. This would add 
another layer of complexity to contestants' programs, 
matching sights to sounds. I believe deciding whether the 
audio/visual requirement ofthe Loehner Grand Prize is 
to be multimedia or discrete is an important issue. 
If it were decided that he audio and visual tests would 
be combined, then another test technique would be to 
have the judge and contestant both watch a short 
multimedia clip, and conduct interviews regarding the 
film. Although this expectation would indeed require

competitors to develop recognition technology well 
beyond the merger of budding existing technologies (as 
the identifications ofobjects in still frames has yet a ways 
to go). Again, another technique might be to have the 
judge sit in front of a camera nd microphone toconduct 
the interview, the computer's orconfederate's responses 
could be returned via printed screen text. Visual 
questions could pertain to the judges own appearance. 
This could accomplish testing all three aspects of the A/V 
TT in one interview. 
5. In Conclusion 
I would like to conclude by simply thanking Hugh 
Loebner for the event he's started, David Powers and 
everyone who has volunteered time to give the contest 
the exciting feeling and potential itholds.
