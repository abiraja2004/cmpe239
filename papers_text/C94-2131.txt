Summary: The paper introduces an alternative to 
the lexical rules in a lexicon in a HPSG style by 
replacing them by relational constraints corre- 
sponding more directly to the standard lexico- 
graphic and morphological practice. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar 
(HPSG, Polhu'd & Sag,87 and 93) came into be= 
ing as and remains apredominantly s ntactic the- 
ory. This is reflected not only in the main theoret~ 
ical orientation, but also in the structuration of 
linguistic data within (the standard versions o0 
the theory. 
As the majot-ity, if not all, current heo- 
ries, HPSG relies on an ample representation f 
linguistic knowledge within the lexicon rather 
than in the grammar rules. This knowledge, then, 
is in HPSG organized in a crossing inheritance 
hierarchy of lexical types, which should express 
the regularities and generalizations ~v,:curring in 
the lexicon and thus awfid redundant s ipulations. 
However, in spite of the fact that the lexi- 
con - at least as far as the amount of information 
is concerned - plays an absolutely central role in 
the theory, the organization of data within HPSG 
clearly reflects the primary syntactic oncerti of 
the theory, with lexicon on a secondary position 
only. In particular, this comes into light when the 
presence of more tradition',fl views of organization 
of lexical data (proved useful by long lexico- 
graphic and linguistic practice) is sought - such 
views are represented only marginally or not at 
all t. 
in this paper, I shall try 
(i) to show that neglecting standard insights of 
the organization of lexicon is detrimental both to 
the linguistic adequacy and to the practical usefid- 
ness of the lexicon, 
(ii) to make a proposal of an alternative r concil~ 
ing the needs of HPSG with the usual lexico- 
graphic practice. 
2. TIlE HPSG STANDARD 
As the basic type of object of linguistic descrip- 
tion HPSG adopts the sign 2, and builds a sub- 
sumption hierarchy of its subtypes, whose top 
level is sketched in (1). 
sign 
phrasal l ex ica l  / \  
major milxo~ 
The idea behind this hierarchy is that each node is 
associated with bundles of features, which are in- 
herited by all nodes directly or indirectly subordi- 
nated to this node, by means of which a lot of re- 
dundant stipulations of features can be removed. 
There are, however, two points about the 
hierarchy fi'om (1) which may be worth reconsid- 
ering. First, it is the fact that linguistics in general 
is concerned with a broader class of objects thau 
signs - e.g., phonemes, morphs etc. are objects 
having no semantics, i.e. they ~- by definition -
cannot fall into the class of signs, and if ItPSG 
aims at becoining a full linguistic theory, these 
objects have to be also taken into consideration. 
Second, the hierarchy reflects only the syntacti- 
cally motivated ivision of lexic~d signs into ma- 
jor and minor ones, but tire other possible - and in 
fact more standard - divisions into autosemantic 
vs. synsemantic 3 words and productive vs. non- 
productive word classes are missing. 
Apart from this, tlPSG stipulates tire lexi- 
con to be a full-fornl one, i.e. a lexicon where all 
word-forms of a language occur as actual items in 
the lexicon (leaf nodes in the hierarchy). This is 
also an approach which hardly finds a parallel in 
the standard lexicographic practice (even for lan~ 
guages with that poor morphology as English 
has), and in addition an approach which at least 
on the explanatory level enforces the necessity of 
lexical (redundancy) rules - which, on the other 
hand, do not fit into the general image of HPSG 
at all. 
l'rovided that the lexicon is viewed from a 
"declarative" perspective 4, the lexical rules ex- 
press static rehttionships ( uch as inflection) be- 
tween members of word classes. These relation- 
ships are, however, not needed for the fimction- 
ing of the system (since all word forms are avail- 
able anyway) - they have to exist only because 
without hem the lexicon would be linguistically 
clearly inadequate. 
The other option, namely the "procedural" 
perspective, seems to be even worse, since it 
breaks the overall "declarative" strategy of 
HPSG; in particular, it enforces inequality of sta- 
tus of different lexical items (some being "basic" 
and some beiug only "derived" - in the very pro- 
cedural sense of the word).

3. RELATIONAL CONSTRAINTS 
AS ALTERNATIVE 
Based on the preceding facts and (first of 
all) on the standard linguistic practice, it is possi- 
ble to propose an alternative hierarchy of objects a
linguistic theory should deal with, whose "top 
part" can be sketched as in the crossing hierarchy 
given in (2), where appurtenance of several sub- 
types of a type to classification according to the 
same key is marked off by an arc connecting the 
respective branches of the hierarchy - in particu- 
lar, two divisions according to different keys are 
to be observed for the class "linguistic object", 
one corresponding to a "functional" perspective 
(the division into signs and non-signs), the other 
one corresponding toa "formalisfic" perspective 5. 
( 2 ) linguistic object 
sign non-sxgn phrase word word-base morpheme 
auto syn 
semtic  
auto-,, -wd 
morph 
syn-s-wd auto-s-m syn-s-m 
Among members of this hierarchy, certain paral- 
lels are to be observed. In particular, it is worth to 
observe the parallel between the construction of 
phrases (which consist of words) and the con- 
struction of words (consisting of morphemes and 
- in case of composed words - of bases, i.e. 
combinations of autosemantic morphemes). In an 
HPSG-like notation, the "consisting of" can be 
approximated by the feature structure (3), with 
obvious meaning of the relational constraints 
phon_cons is ts_o f  and sem_cons is ts_o f .

& sem consists ~f(2,  {4~6, .... 2(n+l)  }) 
rphon: 2n+l 1'~./\] 
Y Lse~ : :z (n+iUj j 
The parallel, however, does not go much farther 
than that. In particular, the differences are that: 
a. phrases consist of other phrases, but words (at 
least as a rule) do not consist of other words 
b. for a word, at most one among its constituents, 
Re base, is autosemantic (at least as a rule, again) 
Taking into consideration this as well as 
still other factors, one can build up in more detail 
the top of the hierarchy of linguistic objects as in 
(4) (the "lexicon" part of the hierarchy being 
marked off by the interrupted line). 
(4) sign . .. ?" ~ word .~ ?  
/ ~ s s inf lected non- inf lected ~? 
/ \ ,- ?, 
auto syn ~ nom adjec verbal adverb ~ 
semtic semtic . s " inal t ival ~-~ ial ~ ~ 
~ ~noun pe'rs ad jec ~ad~ maln aux ..... ~ 
pron tire pron verb verb 
The class which is of particular interest in con- 
nection with the effort of removing the deficien- 
cies of the lexical rules is the class inflected. By 
the very fact that this class - by definition - sub- 
sumes all inflected words and by parallel to (3), 
this class should be associated with the con- 
strained feature structure (5). 
824 
(5) phon: 1 
pref ixes :{  \[phon. 3\], \[phon: 5\], ..., \[phon: 2n+l\]} 
base:  2 
suf f ixes :{  \[phon: 4\], \[phon: 6\], .... \[phon: 2k+2\] 
& phon cons is ts  of( l ,  {3,5, . . . ,2n+i},2 ,  {4,6, . . . ,2k+2}) 
The definition of the relational constraint in (5) is 
actually the formal definition of inflection in the 
respective language 6. In particular, this allows for 
expressing the part-of-speech independent regu- 
larities of inflection on one slot of the language 
model rather than repeatedly as with standard 
lexical rules (an example of such regularity might 
be the infix -e- in English words "goes" and 
"potatoes"). 
Having viewed the "top" part of the lexical 
hierarchy, let us turn our attention now to its 
bottom and middle. 
The leaf elements of the hierarchy are lex- 
emes - feature bundles encoding the most id- 
iosyncratic information about a particular word. 
As a rule, a lexeme consists of the base Cr oot") 
of the word and of the semar tic information as- 
sociated with this base. 
In the typical case, a lexeme of an in- 
flected word has two immediate superclasses. 
These correspond to the cross-classification f 
(inflected) words according to, first, subcatego- 
rization requirements of the respective word (as in 
standard HPSG), and, second, according to the 
inflection class of the word. The respective sub- 
categorization class then assigns to the word 
those subcategorization requirements which are 
not influenced by its morphology, as well as ba- 
sic information about he nature of subcategoriza- 
tion requirements which do undergo changes due 
to the morphological form of the word. The in- 
flection class, then, in the form of a relational 
constraint ties together the morphological features 
of the word with the respective affix(es), the con- 
straint being in fact the (traditional) inflection 
table. 
Finally, when these two classes meet up- 
per in the hierarchy, the class where they meet 
defines, again via a relational constraint, he exact 
relation between the subcategorization a d the 
morphological form of the word. The example (6) 
showing the verb "accuse" might clarify this. 
(6) "~ in  verb" 
~form:  1 
subcat :2 
va~s~cat  : 
f i xedsubcat :  
/ / 
"conjugat ion class No.154" 
~form:

" t rans i t ive"

I 
"transitive with PP-of" 
\[ f ixed_subcat  : {PP \[of\] } \] 
base : <accus>\] 
ontent: ? - . d 
In the case of totally inegularly inflected words, it 
would be of course inadequate opostulate a class 
expressing the inflection of this very one word 
only. The simplest solution in this case is to as- 
sociate the respective relational constraint ex- 
pressing inflection directly with the lexeme, cf. 
example (7) (technical variations concerning tile 
base and affixes are possible, but insubstantial).

4. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper I tried to show how relational con- 
straints can take over the bulk of (if not all) the 
work which is in standard HPSG assigned to the 
operation of lexical rules. 
Such an approach as at least the follow- 
ing two major advantages: 
1. it is much more straightforwardly related to the 
standard lexicographic and morphological usage, 
a matter which is of a remarkable theoretical nd 
even greater practical importance 
2. the disadvantages of the lexical rules approach 
to lexicon mentioned in the first part of this paper 
(either inherent procedurality of the description or 
inherent redundancies in the description) disap- 
pear with the replacement of the (also formally 
poorly understood) lexical rules by the standard 
machinery of relational constraints. 
As a minor point in favour of the sketched 
approach it might be noted that it also easily 
avoids such counterintuitive stipulations as postu- 
lating the division of English verbs into classes 
"auxiliary", "main" and a singleton class "have- 
as-abstract-verb" (cf. Pollard and Sag,87, p.215) 
which was necessary due to the fact that both the 
main verb "have" and the auxiliary "have" are of 
the same - idiosyncratic - inflection class. All that 
is necessary to say on the given approach is that 
the two "have"s differ as to their contents and as 
to their subcategorization (i.e. they constitute two 
lexemes at the bottom of the lexical hierarchy), 
while simultaneously belonging to the same con- 
jugation class, cf. (8). 
"conjugat ion of have . . . .  main verb . . . .  aux verb" / 
\ [content:  \[reln: possess ion \ ]  \] \ [content:  \[reln: <empty>\]  \] 
As for applications, a large computational 
lexicon of Czech, based on ideas presented in this 
paper, is currently under preparation in the 
framework of a project aiming at the development 
of a prototype of a grammar-checker. Tiffs project 
is being carried out jointly with the Charles 
University in Prague.

FOOTNOTES 
I Cf. also the following complete quotation of Sect 8.3. 
Suggestions for further eading from (Pollard & Sag,87) p. 
218: 
The key ideas in this chapter (i.e. "The Lexical Hierarchy 
and Lexical Rules") arise not from previous linguistic 
studies, but rather from algebraic approaches to datatype 
theory and the semantics of programming such as ...; sim- 
ilar ideas are widely employed inframe-based knowledge 
representation systems (see ...). 
l just want to point out that hardly anyone wouldprotest if 
"the key ideas ... arise not ONLY from previous linguistic 
studies, but ALSO from ...". tlowever, the current word- 
ing explicitly excludes any reference to previous linguistic 
work. 
21n accordance with the tradition going back at least o de 
Saussure (Saussure,15), a sign is an object relating a 
(phonetic)form and a (semantic) ontent. 
31n different erminology, "content vs. function". 
4 Cf. (Pollard & Sag,87), p.209 ff. 
5 Though (2) corre,~ponds rather well to the traditional pic~ 
ture, it is worth remarking that a more simple hierarchy 
can be achieved by making phrase, word, word-base and 
morpheme subtypes of sign (in a division different from 
the autosemantic/synsemantic opposition) while making 
morph and smaller units sub-ciasses of non-sign. For our 
purpose, this point is, however, immaterial. 
6 Taken strictly, as it is, the definition does not take into 
consideration i troflective languages. This, however, can 
be remedied simply by reformulating the constraint accord?
