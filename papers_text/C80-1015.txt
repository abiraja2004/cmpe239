This  paper  proposes  a model  of 
automat ic  process ing  of t ime- re la ted  
express ions  by int roduc ing the not ion  of 
focus in the cogn i t ion  level. The l in- 
gu ist ic  categor ies  of t ime are 
determined on the bas is  of the rela-  
t ionsh ips  among the t ime of an extra-  
l inguist ic  s ituation, the focused t ime 
and the t ime of utterance.  
INTRODUCTION 
It is genera l ly  unders tood  that 
there is no one- to -one cor respondence  
between the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  (real 
world) t ime of s i tuat ions  and the gram- 
mat ica l  express ions  of t ime in sen- 
tences of natura l  languages.  If there 
is no cor respondence  of the extra-  
l ingu is t ic  s i tuat ion to the l ingu is t ic  
express ions,  it is imposs ib le  to simu- 
late this process  by a computer  model.  
This  paper  proposes  a model  of 
automat ic  process ing  of t ime- re la ted  
express ions  by int roduc ing the not ion  
of focus in the cogni t ion level between 
the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  t ime of s i tuat ions  
and the l ingu is t ic  express ions  of time. 
As  well, it points  the way toward the 
computer - rea l i za t ion  of the model.  The 
computer  programming language used for 
this model  is SNOBOL. 
Fa i lu re  of cor respondence  between 
an ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion and l in- 
gu ist ic  express ions  of the t ime concept  
can eas i ly  be demonst ra ted  in most  lan- 
guages, if not all. For  example, sup- 
pose the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion is 
the speaker 's  wr i t ing  dur ing a cer ta in  
per iod in the past  (say, between two 
and three o 'c lock  yesterday) .  In re- 
ference to it, we can use any of the 
fo l lowing sentences.  
(i) I wrote  a letter.  
(2) I was wr i t ing  a letter.  
(3) I have wr i t ten  a letter. 
(4) I had wr i t ten  a letter  (when 
John  came). 
The d i f ferences  among sentences (i) 
through (4) are at t r ibuted to the 
speaker 's  d i f ferent  point  of view. 
Comr i@ ment ions  that 'aspects are dif-  
ferent  ways Qf v iewing the internal  
temporal  const i tuenc\[  ~ of s ituations. '  
The speaker 's  way of viewing, however,  
af fects  not on ly  his choice of aspects 
but also his choice of tenses. Note 
the fo l lowing examples from Japanese.  
(5) ah sokoni aru. 
'There it isI' 
(6) ah sokoni atta. 
'There it was (all the time)!' 
There is no d i f ference in the denota-  
t ive meaning of sentences (5) and (6). 
Both  sentences can be used when someone 
has found something he has been looking 
for. Whether  the speaker uses sentence 
(5) or sentence (6) depends, again, on 
his v iew point. 
FOCUS 
The d i f ference in the speaker 's  
v iew-point ,  or that of cognit ion,  can- 
not be ignored, as seen in the above 
examples, when we cons ider  the t ime- 
re lated express ions  of natural  lan- 
guage. Phys ica l  events in the extra-  
l ingu is t ic  wor ld  present themselves  as 
sense data, and are perce ived not pass- 
ively, but act ive ly  by an intervent ion 
of mind, and are subsequent ly  stored in 
the momory  as exper iences.  The exper i -  
ences represent  the mater ia l  that can 
be formulated and ar t icu lated as the 
l inguis t ic  forms. 
We be l ieve  that unless  we incor- 
porate cogni t ion into the process  of 
generat ing  l inguis t ic  express ions  we 
cannot exp la in  the re lat ionsh ip  between 
the ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ions and the 
l inguis t ic  express ions.  And we con- 
s ider the not ion of focus the most  im- 
portant  cogni t ive  e lement in connect ion  
wi th  t ime-related express ions.  'Focus' 
is def ined as the per iod along the 
ext ra - l ingu is t i c  t ime l ine upon which  
the speaker  d i rects  his attent ion.  
MODEL 
By incorporat ing the speaker 's  
focus into a model  we can generate  the 
t ime-re lated express ions  rather 
-101  - -  
automatically, that is, by one-to-one 
correspondence, and therefore it is 
possible to implement this model as a 
computer model to generate l inguistic 
expressions. 
For the model we consider three 
levels; that is, 
i. the extra- l inguist ic (real world) 
level, 
2. the cognit ion level, and 
3. the l inguistic level. 
Information on extra- l inguist ic situ- 
ations observed by the speaker is 
stored in the extra- l inguist ic level in 
the form of the situation and its ex- 
isting period of time. The speaker's 
focus in the cognition level is matched 
against the situation(s) in the extra- 
l inguistic level and the way they 
match or do not match determines the 
selection of l inguistic items such as 
verbs, adjectives, negation, aspect and 
tense. 
The l inguistic level forms the 
sentences by syntactic, morphological 
and phonological rules. 
EXTRA-LINGUISTIC LEVEL 
The computer model under consider- 
ation simulates this process by our 
creating three levels here also. The 
extra- l inguist ic level stores infor- 
mation on situations in the following 
form (Nos. 2-9 of the appended program). 
SITUATION START-DS END-DS END-SS 
SPEAK(I) 10030930 10031000 
READ(I,A-BOOK) 
10021400 10021630 
COME(JOHN,HERE) 
I0021130 10021200 10021400 
GO-ON(A-LIGHT) 
10021900 10021900 10022359 
CALM(IT,HERE) 
10012000 10012000 10030500 
The information includes situation in 
the form of verbal expressions and 
their arguments, the starting time of 
dynamic situations, the ending time of 
dynamic situations, and the ending time 
of static situations. In the number 
for the time, the first two digits 
stand for the month, the next two for 
the day, the next two for the hour, and 
the last two for the minute. This 
number system may be expanded to in- 
clude the year, the second, etc. 
Extra- l inguist ic  situations are 
divided into two categories; dynamic and 
static. Fox the distinction, let us 
quote LyonsJ(p. 483) . 
A static situation (or state-of- 
affairs, or state) is one that is 
conceived of as existing, rather than 
happening, and as being homogeneous, 
continuous and unchanging throughout 
its duration. A dynamic situation, 
on the other hand, is something that 
happens (or occurs, or takes place): 
it may be momentary or enduring; it 
is not necessari ly either homogeneous 
or continuous, but may have any of 
several temporal contours;... 
Dynamic situations are in turn 
divided into two types. Those such as 
'reading' are situations occurring for 
a certain period of time. Therefore 
situations of this type have a starting 
time and an ending time. The second 
type of dynamic situation, like '(a 
light) going on', is momentary, and 
therefore it is understood that the 
starting time and the ending time are 
identical. 
Static situations, on the other 
hand, continue for a certain period of 
time. But they may be results of dy- 
namic situations and they may also 
change into other situations again by 
dynamic situations. The starting time 
of a static situation is usual ly the 
ending time of a dynamic situation and 
its ending time, if any, is the starting 
time of another dynamic situation. 
It is worth mentioning here that 
what are stored in this level are not 
l inguistic expressions but situations. 
Therefore, the time period of an ex- 
isting situation is not influenced by 
the type of part icular l inguistic ex- 
pressions of a part icular natural lan- 
guage. Taking an Engl ish expression 
for example, '(a light) goes on' is 
considered to be momentary event. 
Therefore, we cannot say '~a light is 
going on.' However, 'lights are going 
on' is possible, in which case we can 
identify a different starting time and 
ending time. Further, if we could ob- 
serve the period of duration of a 
light going on by a high-speed film for 
instance, the different starting and 
ending times could be recorded in the 
data by expanding time digits to second 
or mill isecond. 
However, there are some phenomena 
peculiar to individual languages. For 
instance, the situation of 'coming' is 
--102-- 
cons idered to have a t ime durat ion  in 
Engl ish.  Therefore,  ' John is coming' 
is a paraphrase  of ' John is on the way.' 
But in Japanese it is cons idered to be 
momentary,  that is, 'coming' is a sort 
of swi tch from 'is not here' to 'is 
here'.  There fore  there is not Japanese 
express ion  equ iva lent  to Eng l i sh  ' John 
is coming.' Theoret ica l ly ,  this k ind 
of d i f ference among indiv idual  lan- 
guages should be taken care of by elab- 
orat ing the structure of s i tuat ions  in 
the data of this level, but in the cur- 
rent model  it is taken care of by the  
l inguis t ic  level. 
COGNIT ION LEVEL 
Now in the cogni t ion  level, the 
focused s i tuat ion and the per iod of 
focus as wel l  as the t ime of u t terance  
are inserted into the program (Program 
Nos. 10-27). The focused s i tuat ion  is 
in the form of verbal  express ion  and 
its arguments.  The per iod  of focus is 
in the form of e i ther  a t ime adverbia l  
such as 'now', 'this morning, ,  'yes- 
terday' and ' last month',  or numbers  
for chrono log ica l  t ime points  s imi lar  
to those of ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion  
time. When the input is a t ime adverb-  
ial, the program ca lcu lates  it against  
the t ime of ut terance and t rans lates  
it into chronolog ica l  numbers  (Program 
Nos. 28-40). 
So far, data stored in the pro-  
gram are: 
i. Ex t ra - l ingu is t i c  s ituat ions,  each 
comprising: 
a. the start ing t ime-po int  of a 
dynamic s i tuat ion(A),  
b. the ending t ime-po int  of a 
dynamic s i tuat ion(B),  
c. the ending t ime-po int  of a 
stat ic  s i tuat ion(C);  
2. T ime of utterance(O):  
3. Focused situat ion, compris ing: 
a. the start ing t ime-po int  of 
focus(S),  and 
b. the ending t ime-po int  of 
focus(E).  
Here it is checked whether  a par- 
t icu lar  ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion ex- 
ists w i th in  the focused per iod or mo- 
ment  and, if so, how it is focused. 
On the bas is  of the re lat ionsh ip  among 
the three k inds of t ime-po ints  of an 
ext ra - l ingu is t i c  s i tuat ion (A,B and C), 
and the two k inds of focus t ime-po ints  
of the same focused s i tuat ion (S and 
E), the cagegor ies  of aspects are de- 
termined (Program Nos. 41-62).  
The categor ies  of aspects are de- 
termined in the fo l lowing way: 
I . 
i. 
a. 
b. 
2. 
a. 
b. 
If the focus is on the Stat ic  
S i tuat ion(SS)~ 
and if the focus is on the 
point, 
and if the focus is complete ly  
inside the SS, then: STATIVE, 
otherwise,  the Dynamic  Si tu-  
ation(DS) is checked. 
If it is otherwise,  
and if the SS over laps  the 
focus completely,  then: 
STATIVE, 
otherwise,  the DS is checked. 
II. If the focus is complete ly  out-  
side the DS, then: NEGATIVE.  
III. 
1. 
If the focus is on a point, 
and if the DS is on a point, 
then: PERFECTIVE.  
2. If it is otherwise,  and 
a. if the focus is on the begin-  
ning of the DS, then: PER- 
FECTIVE ( INGRESSIVE),  
b. if the focus is on the ending 
of the DS, then: PERFECTIVE 
(COMPLETED),  
c. if ne i ther  of the above, then: 
IMPERFECTIVE.

iii. 
If the focus is on a period, 
and if the DS is on a point, 
then: PERFECTIVE.  
If it is otherwise,  and 
the DS over laps  the focus com- 
pletely, then: IMPERFECTIVE,  
if the DS over laps  the focus 
part ia l ly,  and 
the beg inn ing  of the DS is 
on or before  the ending of 
the focus, then: PERFECTIVE 
( INGRESSIVE),  
the ending of the DS is on or 
before the ending of the 
focus, then: PERFECTIVE 
(COMPLETED),  
it is ne i ther  of the above, 
then: PERFECTIVE.  
Th is  aspect ass ignment  is i l lust rated 
in the d iagrams in the Append ix  I. 
The categor ies  of tenses are in 
turn determined on the bas is  of the 
re la t ionsh ip  between the focused time 
and the t ime of u t terance  (Program 
Nos. 63-69). If the focus is on the 
t ime of utterance,  the PRESENT is as- 
signed. If the focus is before  the 
t ime of utterance,  the PAST is as- 
signed~ if the reverse, the FUTURE. 
Japanese and Russian,  for example, 
work  in this way. In Eng l i sh  one more 
--103-- 
category of tense is needed. That is, 
if the focus is on a period and the end 
of the focus coincides with the time of 
utterance, the PAST-PRESENT is assigned. 
This category will later cover ex- 
pressions like 'I have been studying 
linguistics.' 
FINAL REMARKS 
In the l inguistic level time- 
related morphemes are assigned on the 
basis of the categories of t ime-related 
expressions sent from the cognit ion 
level. Here the pecul iarit ies of indi- 
vidual natural languages are involved. 
Therefore a unique program is required 
for each natural language. After  the 
morpheme assignments, syntactic and 
morphological rules together with 
phonological rules determine the forms 
in the sentences. 
We shall omit detailed discussion 
on this level, since this process in- 
volving word categories closely re- 
lated to the dist inction between dy- 
namic and static situations is compli- 
cated. For simplicaity of explanation, 
we have omitted the discussion and the 
programming of expressions of habit, 
experience and atemporal expressions. 
We have also omitted the discussion of 
relative tenses. 
In summary, we have discussed an 
automatic process of t ime-expression 
generation in natural language. We 
believe that this is only possible by 
the introduction of the speaker's time 
focus and an examination of the rela- 
t ionship between the extra- l inguist ic 
situational time and focused time. By 
further examining the manner of mor- 
pheme assignments in as many natural 
languages as possible, we believe, we 
can expand the number of universal 
rules common to all languages and 
minimize the number of rules peculiar 
to individual languages.
