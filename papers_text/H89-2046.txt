ABSTRACT 
We are carrying out investigations into the application of biophysical and computational models to speech 
processing. Described here are studies of the robustness of a speech representation using a biophysical model 
of the cochlea; experimental results on the representation f speech and complex sounds in the mammalian 
auditory cortex; and descriptions of computational sequential processing networks capable of recognizing 
sequences of phonemes. 
INTRODUCTION 
Systems for the automatic recognition of speech ave in recent years derived many ideas and strategies from 
observations ofthe structure and processing modes of the nervous ystem, and specifically of the mammalian 
auditory system. Examples range from the adoption of cochlear-like processing as front-end analysis tages, 
to the use of artificial neural networks as adaptive pattern recognizers. For the last five years, we have 
been studying the functions and algorithms that facilitate the remarkable abilities of the auditory system 
to analyze, recognize, and localize complex sounds uch as speech, music, and other environmental sounds. 
We have developed and used biophysical and computational models of the peripheral cochlear stages, of the 
intermediate c ntral neural networks that extract various feature representations of the acoustic stimulus 
(e.g., as in speech phonemes), and of networks for the recognition of temporally ordered sequences ( uch as 
words and sentences). These models have been described in detail in \[1,2,3,4,5\]. Here, we shall outline a few 
of our recent investigations and the results that we have obtained. 
NOISE  ROBUSTNESS 
Cochlear models in various forms are now commonly used in speech recognition systems. In many cases, 
they are severely simplified to reduce computational complexity, preserving only salient features of the 
original models, e.g., the psuedo-logarithmic frequency axis, critical-band filters, and the fast and/or slow 
adaptation (as AGCs). These and other processing steps have been justified in many elaborate and detailed 
experiments. One of the most desired features of cochlear processing has been robustness to noise, specifically, 
their supposed ability to provide a stable representation f the speech signal over a wide range of signal- 
to-noise ratios. Results from a few studies have so far been equivocal for many reasons, primary among 
them is the complexity of the systems tested which precluded clear separation of the causes of improvements 
and degradations. We have compared the noise immunity of cochlear epresentations to that of linear 
predictor coefficients (LPC), LPC cepstral coefficients, and discrete time Fourier Transform (DFT) spectra. 
Specifically, three investigations are performed: first, the distortion of each representation due to additive 
white noise is measured; in the second experiment, the robustness i measured through the deterioration i  
the vector quantizer performance ofeach representation; and finally, in the third experiment we measure the 
ability of each representation to discriminate speech sounds in noise. 
Ninety sentences spoken by ten male speakers are taken from the phonetically abeled Icecream database 
and transformed into each of the four representations after upsampling from 16KHz to 20Kiiz (the cochlear 
model requires a 20KItz sampling rate). The cochlear model followed by two stages of lateral inhibition 
325 
\[1\] produces vectors of 128 tonotopically ordered elements from the 100ttz to 10KHz region of the basilar 
membrane. For all representations, a 20ms frame and 8ms step size are used, and, except for the cochlear 
model, a preemphasis of 1.0 and a Hamming window are applied. 
The Log Area Ratios are obtained from the LPC coefficients of an order 28 predictor found via the auto- 
correlation method. The Log Area Ratios are used because of their appropriateness forvector quantization 
and mean square distortion measurements. The LPC cepstral coefficients are also computed via autocorre- 
lation and the quefrency ranged from 0.0625 ms to 3.0625 ms. The spectrum is computed by a 256 point 
FFT with zero padding. 
In the tests performed, noisy speech is obtained by adding white gaussian noise of the appropriate 
amplitude to the clean speech. The slight oversampling of the speech is taken into account in determining 
the noise amplitude. The signal to noise levels investigated are 24dB - 0dB in steps of 3dB. 
FEATURE D ISTORTION 
The actual effect of additive noise on the various representations is measured first as 
1/N N E j=I  \[\[K(F(sj)) - K (F (s j  + n/))l\[2 
Dpe,.?~,~t Di,to,.tion = 1/NE~r=i IIK(F(*D)II2 
where F(s j )  is the representation f frame j of the clean speech, N is the number of frames, and sj + nj 
refers to a frame of speech with additive noise. 
The Karhunen-Loeve transform, K, is computed for each representation from the autocovariance of 
the clean speech features. It is chosen as a means of reducing the dimension of the cochlear model in an 
optimum fashion. Since it also can be used to restrict measured ata to a known signal space, it is applied to 
all representations so as not to give the cochlear model an unfair advantage. The eigenvectors corresponding 
to the 48 largest eigenvalues of the autocovariance matrix are chosen to form the transform kernel for both 
the spectral and cochlear epresentations. For the LPC and LPC cepstrum, all eigenvectors are retained. 
Note that if all eigenvectors are retained I \ [g(F(s)) - g (F (s  + n))\[\[2 = HE(s) - F(s  + n)\[\[2 so the transform 
does not affect the distortion computation for the LPC and LPC cepstrum, and in practice, the spectral 
distortion is not reduced by the change in dimension. 
The cochlear model suffers less distortion than the other representations at noise levels less than 9db, at 
which point it becomes parallel to the parametric models (Figure l(a)). 
VECTOR QUANTIZER D ISTORTION 
Another comparison among the different representations is through the effects of noise on the performance 
of vector quantizers (VQs) trained with clean speech. The effect of noise on the both VQ class distributions 
for each phoneme and the increase in codebook distortion are used as the measuring criteria. 
Codebooks of 64 symbols are trained on clean speech and sample distributions of the VQ classes are 
formed for each phoneme at all noise levels. The similarity between the class distribution of the quantized 
clean speech, f, ,  and the distribution of the quantized noisy speech, fs+n, is measured by 
DDi,t~ib~tlo. Di.to~tio. = 1 -- Ei6_41 fs(i)" f~+n(i) 
64 ?2 (iS ~...~64 
For presentation and comparison, the measurement of each representation is normalized by its 0db value. 
Only the results for the most frequently occurring vowel,/ey/, are given (Figure l(b)), but the results for 
other phonemes, with the exception of stops, are essentially the same. In the case of the stops (and during 
silences), all representations seem to perform similarly. 
Since the distribution of the VQ classes for particular phonemes i important to many statistical methods 
of speech recognition, the superior performance of the cochlear epresentation is significant. The class

distributions show that the LPC and cepstrum, as noise increases, model all the speech sounds as noise, 
which the VQ labels as one of three or four classes. This happens also to the cochlear representation, but at 
higher noise levels. 
An alternative way of measuring VQ performance is through the codebook distortion, defined as 
N 
DvQ Distortion = 1/N ~ IIF(sj) - VQ(F(sj + n~))l12 
j= l  
This is also computed for each phoneme, but only the composite results are presented here, normalized by 
the 0db distortion (Figure l(c)). 
A similar measure based on 1/g~;=l  IlYQ(F(sj))- YQ(F(sj + nj))ll2 is also computed. The results 
closely resemble those in Figure l(c), but include a common bias due to the codebook distortion. The 
measures  DDistribution Distortion and DVQ Distortion show that the cochlear model performs well at noise 
levels below 9db. 
D ISCRIMINAT ION AB IL ITY  
The ability of the LPC cepstrum and cochlear model to discriminate between different phonemes in the 
presence of additive noise is an important performance measure in speech recognition. The phonetic labels 
327 
in the database are used to compute avariant of the Fischer Discrimination tocompare the intra-class scatter 
to the inter-class catter at each noise level. This measure favors representations i  which features assigned 
to any particular phoneme are tightly clustered and distant from features assigned to other phonemes. The 
evaluation is given by 
Dcon\]usion Score = 1/n log det Sw 
det SB 
where Swand SB are the intra-class and inter-class catter matrices, respectively 
Sw = ~ ~ (x - mi)(x - rni) t 
i= l  xExi 
c 
SB = n , (m,  -- m) (m,  -- m) '  
i=1  
and c is the number of phonemes, Xi is the collection of all representations, x, labeled as the i ~h phoneme, 
ni is the cardinality of Xi, and m and mi are found by averaging all features and averaging all the features 
in Xi, respectively. 
Both the cepstrum and the cochlear model have similar discrimination performance at low noise levels 
(Figure l(d)), but the cochlear model retains its performance better as the additive noise level increases. 
DISCUSSION 
Why is the cochlear epresentation performance superior to other representations? There are probably two 
sources: the first is the compression by the hair cell models; the second is the spectral extraction strategy 
- the lateral inhibitory network (LIN) - applied to the cochlear model output. Compression produces a 
well know effect of enhancing a signal in a noisy background (see \[3\]). In the cochlear models it is possible 
to apply strong compression without loss of spectral detail because the spectral information is encoded in 
the phase locked responses. The LIN utilizes this phase locking to extract a robust spectral estimate that 
can tolerate xtreme compression. Such compression is not feasible for spectrogram representations since it 
completely destroys the spectral peaks and valleys. 
AUDITORY NEUROPHYSIOLOGY 
In the central auditory system, we are investigating the nature of the representation f complex acoustic 
spectra in the auditory cortex \[4\]. Recordings of unit responses along the isofrequency contours of the 
ferret primary auditory cortex reveal systematic changes in the symmetry of their receptive fields. At the 
center, units with narrow and symmetric inhibitory sidebands predominate. These give way gradually to 
asymmetric nhibition, with high frequencies (relative to the best frequency of the units) becoming more 
effective caudally, and weaker ostrally. This organization gives rise to a new columner organization i the 
primary auditory cortex that seems to encode spectral slopes and the symmetry of spectral peaks, edges, and 
envelopes. These columns are analogous to the well known orientation columns of the visual system. The 
implication of these findings is that in the perception and recognition of complex sounds pecial attention 
must be given to the representation f spectral gradients. We have simulated the receptive fields obtained 
in neurophysiological experiments and are in the process of examining in detail the representation f natural 
and synthetic stationary speech tokens in the responses of the cortex (Figure 2). 
WORD RECOGNIT ION 
Finally, we have been developing models of networks that can be used for the recognition of temporally- 
ordered sequences (e.g., phoneme sequences in a word) \[5\]. These networks are biologically plausible in that 
they do not require delay-lines to memorize the word prior to recognition. Instead, they function in a manner

analogous to phase-locked loops, where the network locks onto an incoming sequence and predicts one state 
ahead. An error signal between the network state and the input is fed back to control the rate of progression 
in the network states (Figure 3). 
The system is based on a nonlinear ecurrent lateral inhibitory network operating in a hysteresis mode 
which functions as a pattern generator. The network consists of a single layer of reciprocally and strongly 
inhibited neurons. The profile of connectivities is designed such that the patterns of the desired sequence are 
stable states of the network outputs. It can be shown that, when equally activated, the network settles in 
any one of its stable states depending on its initial conditions, i.e. displays a hysteresis behavior. A network 
generates a sequence when it cycles through its stable states. In order to control the order and rate of this 
process, integrating excitatory connections are formed that project from the elements of one pattern to the 
elements of the succeeding pattern. Only one time-constant of integration is used for all connections in the 
network. The varying durations of the sequence patterns are encoded not as different ime constants but as 
different widths of the hysteresis loops between the different patterns, i.e. through the magnitudes of the 
inhibitory connectivities in the network.

The proposed network can be readily used as a recognizer of sequences applied to its input. The key 
concept here is the degree of correspondence b tween the applied input and the internally predicted state of 
the network. This measure is used to modulate the mode of operation in the network between a free-cycling 
mode when the correspondence is high, and an input-dominated mode when it is low. The measure is a 
state-dependent function derived during training, similar to a likelihood function. Thus, this measure can 
also be used as an indicator of the match between the applied sequence and the sequence generated by the 
network. 
330 
When the confidence is relatively high and the network is free-cycling, it automatically substitutes missing 
patterns and is rather insensitive to small irregularities of the input temporal durations. Therefore, in such 
a scheme, no time-warping is needed.
