Only exa.mples (2a) and (2c) are constituent coordi- 
n~tions. Example (3(:) seems slightly mmal;ural, but 
it is much improved if we replace books by a heavier 
string such as books about 9arde~ing. '\]'hus, for this 
example, any substring of the sentence I can tbrm a 
viable conjuuct. 
DELET ION ACCOUNTS 
In (,he last twenty to thirty yea.rs there have. been a 
sm'ies oP ae('ounts of coordina.tion i volving various de- 
letion me(:halfisms (FIYOHI (~.g. Gldtman, 1965 to vm~ 
()i\]:sOUW, 1987). For exmnple, \['rom the following 'an-

7) John will drive and Mary built the drive 
* \[John will\] and \[Mary built the\] drive 
Here the two cases of drive are phonologically identi- 
cal, but have different syntactic ategories. Now con- 
sider: 
8) a * John bored \[the new hole\] and \[his f>llow wor- 
kers\] 
1) * Mary came in \[a hurry\] and \[a taxi\] 
These are cases of 'zeugma' and are unacceptable ex- 
cept as jokes. It therelbre seems that the deleted 
words must have the same major syntactic category, 
and the same lexical meamng. 
lIowever, even if we fix both syntactic (:ategory and 
lexieal meaning, we still get some weird coordinations. 
For example, consider: 
9) a * Sue  sawi  the  man j  \ [ th rough the  te lescope\] /  
and \[with the troublesome kid\]j 
b *1 saw \[a friend of\] and \[the manuthcturer oil 
Mary's handbag 
In example (3) the two prepositions are attached if- 
ferently, one to the verb saw, the other to the noun, 
man. In exmnple (b), attributed to Paul I)ekker, the 
two coRjunets require Mary's handbag to have a d i f  
ferent syntactic structure: the bracketing appropriate 
\['or the first coajunct is \[\[a friend of Marv/' s handbag\]. 
The unacceptability of these examples uggests that 
word by word identity is insufficient, and that deleted 
material must have identicM syntactic structure, as 
well as identical exieal meanings. 
Some of the most compelling arguments against de- 
letion have been semantic. For examqfle, Lakoff and 
Peters (1969) argued that deletion accounts are inap 
propriate tbr certain constituent coordinations uch 
gtS :
10) John and Mary are alike 
since the 'antecedent' sentence John are alike and 
Mary arc alike is nonsensical (it is also ungrannna- 
tieal if we consider number agreement). 
However, semantically inappropriate or nonsensi- 
cM 'antecedents' are also possible when we consider 
non-constituent coordination. For example, consider 
'antecedents' for the lbl lowing: 
\] 1) *t \[The man who buys\] and \[the woman who sells\] 
rattlesnakes met outside 
b Many former \[soldiers living in England\] and 
\[resistance members living in N:an(:e\] have. si- 
milar memories 
c John sold dill>rent dealers \[a vase using his in- 
tensive sales technique\] and \[a bookcase using 
his market-stM/ technique\] 
( l lb)  is non-constituent coordination under the pri- 
mary reading where the scope of founer  does not con- 
tain living in England i.e. where the semantic bracke- 
ting is: 
12) \[\[former soldiers\] living in England\] 
Examples (a) and (b) could be expanded out at the 
NP level, but not at the S level, l\]owever (e) can- 
not be expanded out at any constituent level, whitsL 
retaining an a.ppropriate semantics. For exan~ple, x- 
pansion at the V1 ) level gives: 
13) John sold different dealers a vase using his inten- 
sive sales technique and different dealers a book- 
ease using his market-staJ1 technique 
'\['lms, although I,akoff and Peters' argmnenls count 
against standard deletion analyses, they do not coullt 
as general arguments against a unified treatment of 
constituent a,nd non-constituent coordination. 
SHARED STR.UCTURE 
Consider the sentence: 
14) John gave Mary a book m\]d Peter a. paper by 
Chomsky 
Instead of thinking of John 9ave and b.!\] Uhomsky as 
deleted, we can also think of them as shared 1)y the 
two conjuncts. This strncture can be represented as 
follows: 
Mary  a bo{}k 
John gave a~M l)y Chomsky  
Pet, m" a paper  
From the result of the previous ection, cac.h (-onjm~ct 
must share not just the phonological materiM, but 
Mso the syntactic structure and the lexieal meanings. 
There are three main methods by which this sharing 
of structure can be achieved: phrasal coordination, 3- 
D coordination, and processing stra.tegies. 
PHRASAL COORDINAT ION 
At first sight, analysing nou-constitnent coordination 
using phra.sal (i.e. constituent) coordilmtion seerns 
nonsensical. This is not the case. (2)or(linations are 
classified as non-constituent coordination if' the con- 
juncts fail to be constituents in a 'sta.n&~rd' phrase 
structure grammar. However, they may well be con- 
stituents in other grammm:s. For ex~ml)le, it has \])een 
argued that the weaker notiol, of constituency i)rovi- 
ded by (Jategorial (\]rammars i  {'xa(:tly what is requi- 
red Bo allow all con.imml;s to be treated as constituents 
(Steedmal\] 1985).

Merging word strings instead of deleting them does 
not help with the problems of deletion acconnts which 
we outlined earlier. In particular, it does not help to 
exclude examples (9a) and (gb) which suggest shared 
material must have identical syntactic structnre. Ho- 
wever, once we have started to think in terms of mer- 
ging, there is an obvious next step, which is to move 
f'rom inerging of word strings to rnerging of synt;ax 
trees. This is the move made by Goodall (1!)87), who 
advocates treating coordination as a. union of phrase 
markers: '% 'pasting together' one or, top of the other 
of two trees, with any identical nodes tnergil~g to- 
gether" ((;oo(hdl, 1987, p.20). We can visualise the 
result in terms o\[' a three-dimensional tree structure, 
where the merged material is on one plane, and the 
syntax trees for each eonjmlct are on two other pla- 
nes. For example, consider the a-l) tree for example 
(17a.) given in Fig. 1.

The merged part of' the tree inch,des all the nodes 
which dominate the shared matel:ial Sue gave. The 
coujmlets retain separate pla.nes (denoted here \] U 
using dot, ted and dashed lines respectively). 
(k)odall's aeco,mt does not deal with examples uch 
as (171)), which he argues to I)e examples of'a different 
phenomcaon, llowew;r flmse can be incorporated into 
a ad)  aeco,nt (e.g. Moltmamh 1992). 
There are various technical difliculties with Gee- 
dali's account (see e.g. van Oirsouw, 1987, and Molt- 
nmnn, 11992). There is also a f'undanmnl,al l)lro- 
blem COl,cerning semantic interpretation of coordina- 
ted structures (see Moltmanu, 1992 which provides 
a revised a.nd more complex 3-1) account based on 
Muadz, 1991). 
\["ot: coordinatioll el' unlike categories, as in the ex- 
amples in (15), Goodatl proposes a treatment some 
what similar to Sag el; al. (1985). I\[owe.w~r there is 
still a problem in dealing with examples where there 
are clit\[>rent urnbers of modifiers, such as (19a) or 
the lbllowing: 
20) a. We can meet at the office or in London outside 
the theaure 
b 'FNT deliver efficiently and after 5pro in Edin- 
burgh 
(~onsider example (b). The synl;ac\[~ic structure appro- 
priate for "FNT' deliver eJficicnthd has one S node and 
two VP nodes, llowever, the structure fbr 7'N7' dell- 
vet after 5pro in l','dinbm~h requires one S node and 
three VP nodes (or three S nodes and one VP node). 
The two structures therefore fail to merge since the 
structure dominating the shared material 7'N7' de- 
liver must be identical. The nse of ordered phrase 
structure trees also excludes examples uch as (19b) .  
\]n summary, the /I-l) approaches correctly enforce 
identity of synta.ctic structure for shared material. 
ltowever, the way of characterising syntactic struc- 
ture using (parts of) st, andard phrase structure trees 
results in a.n overly strict requirement of parallelism 
between the conjnncts. We will now consider pro- 
cessiug strategies, where syntactic structure of shared 
material is eharacterised more indirectly by the state 
of the parser. 
PROCESSING STRATEGIES  
There have been several attempts to trea.t coordi- 
nation by adapting pre-existing parsing strategies. 
For example, NFNs were adapted by Woods (1973), 
I)CGs by Dahl and MeCord (198:1), and chm:t parsers 
by lfaugeneder (\[992). Woods and Dahl & McCord's 
system are similar, ltaugeneder's system has very li- 
mi ted coverage. 
In Wood's SYSCONJ system, the pa.rscr can back 
ap to various points in the history of the parse, and

reaecess the configuration after parsing John gave i.e. 
a stack consisting of a sentence and a. verb phrase, and 
an arc traversal by the verb. The second eoldnnct is 
then parsed according to this contlguration. 
SYSCON./ does not imlnediately merge the two 
stack configurations after completing the second con- 
.iunct, bnt, ins,ca.d, separa.tely parses both conjuncts 
in para.lM until a constituent is completed. For ex- 
ample, on parsing the sentence,

about subjaceney and Mar9 a book about s.abjacencg 
before conjoining at the level of some enclosing con- 
stituent (for example \[.he verb phase). The result is 
theretbre similar to starting with the sentence: 
23) .Jolm gave Mary a I)ook about, subjaeency and 
gave Peter a paper about subjacency 
As noted by Dahl and McCord, this meehanisrn means 
that SYSCONJ inherits the problems of nonsensical 
semantics which plague the deletion accounts, since 
John and Mart  arc alike is treated the same as ,Jo/u~ 
a~v alike a~d Mart  arc alike. The mechanism adso 
causes problen,s \[br dealing with nested coordination.

is diflicull, to see how to deal with the final coidunet.

DYNAMIC GRAMMARS 
I )ynamics is ,lust the s tudy of states and transiLions 
between sta~es. It can be used to specify the states of 
a left; to r ight parser and the possible mapp ings  10et- 
ween states,  l"or example,  Mi lward (:1992b) provides 
a dynamic  descr ipt ion o\[' a shift reduce l)arscr, and a 
dynamic  descript ion of a fully incremental  parser I)a- 
sod on dependency grammar .  Suitable languages for 
dynamics  arc both forma.l and declarative., and are 
therefore also appropr iate  to exl)ress l inguist ic gcne- 
ral isations.

I f we use a dynamic  grammar  to dcseril)c a shift re- 
duce parser, s tates encode the current stack configu- 
ration, and are related by rules which corrcsl)ond to 
shilTting and reducing a Since there are arl)itl:arily 
large, numbers  of different stack conf igurat ions (the 
stack can I:)e of a.rbitrary size), the dynamics  for shift 
reduce l)arsing involves the use of all infinite l/Ulrl- 
her o\[ states.  It thus differs from, say ATNs (Woods

1973), which have a tinite nmnber  of states,  augmen-  
ted by an explicit recursion mechan ism.  
Dynamic  grammars  can t)e presented as rewrite 
g rammars  by using transit ion types instead o\[' the 
more usual  S or NP. For example,  to get the parse 
above we need the lexieal entries: (~ 
John:ciF-~ca likes:caP+% MaJ:y:cbr-Ocf 
aud a single combinat ion  rule. schema which states 
that,  
l)k)r any C1, C2, C3, 
(?D-+C3 -4 C1~C2 C2~->(J3 
A str ing of words is a sentence if it has the tyl)e ,
ci ~-->cf 
where ci and c/  are al)propriate initial and final states 
for a parse r. 
\[n a dynaln ic  g rammar ,  any substr ing of a sentence 
<;all be assigned a type. \['%r example,  likes and Ma W 
can 10e combined to get the type ('aF~rcf. Thus  we 
have an appropr iate hwel to perform substr ing coo l  
dination. Dynamic  grammars  may be extended using 
the following combinat ion  rule (arm and or are both  
given the. special t ransit ion type CONe): 
l"or any (;1, C2, 
C'1~}C2 --~ CIF+C2 CONJ C1~-~C2 
Similar to SYSCON,1, this allows coord inat ion when 
two conjmlcts map between the  salue pairs of states.  
l ' roecssing is also similar,  with the eneounter ing of a 
conjtmetion causing back-up to an earlier stage in the 
pars ing history. Howew~,r, since there is no popping 
of a stack, the fnll pars ing history is awdlable s. I"or 
example,  l ieu gave some books to ,flue has the transi-

Iterated coordination (e.g. for examples uch as Mary, 
.Petc~" and Sue) can be treated ill tilt same way as 
iterated constituent coordination is treated in phrase 
strncture grammars. For example, each transitio~ 
type can be augmented with a feature (+/-)  deno- 
ting whether or not; that transition has been iterated. 
The eoordination rule becomes:

The precise gl:amnlaticality predictions lnacle 1oy 
the dynamic approach depend npon the characteri- 
sation of the states, and hence depend oil the parti- 
eulal: l)arsing strategy which is specified by the (ly- 
naniics, tlowever there are some general predictions 
which can be inade. Firstly, consider conjuncts which 
correspond one t;o one ill the categories of the ee l  
responding words. Here the eonjmletS must provide 
the same transitions, and heuce lIlnst be able to coo> 
dinate (this is a reflection of tile fact that processing 
can back np to any point in the parsing history). This 
predicts that ally substring of a sentence can eoordi- 
ilal;e with itself, and heuce that any snbstring of a 
sentence can act as a eol/junet. I"or eonvel/ience we 
will call this the substrmg h;l/pothesis. Tills hypothesis 
has l)een In:oadly adopted in the work of van Oirsouw 
1987, Barry and l)ickering 1993, and l)y work on the 
1,anlbek Calculus (e.g. Moortgat 1988). 
Apparent counterexamples are at fbllows: 
213) a * The woman spoke to George aild nlan to Pe- 
ter 
b * ,John told \[Mary Bill\] and \[Fred Slle\] was co- 
ming (Barry and Pickering 1993) 
I Iowever it; is dillicult to exchlde these using syntaetie 
constraints, without also exclnding the 1note accepta- 
ble: 
27) a Every woman spoke to (.leorge and lnan spoke 
to Peter 
b ,Iohn told the niotllers that their daughters and 
the fathers that their sons were all at the party 9 
More natural examples where conj/lncts are forlned 
by \[raglnents l'rorrl different COllStit, uent.s are the folio- 
wing: 
28) a The police fonnd sonic \[cars inside\] and \[lorries

b Everyone who I \[admire most came\] and \[ad- 
mire least stayed away\] 
c Mary showed litany \[h'iends the weird books\] 
and \[eolleagues tilt lnore respectable pal)ors \]
written by her mother 
The relative UlmCCel)tability of the examples in (26) 
is perhaps best explained as dne to violations of into-

I.o Jmme Johmulessell. 
national requirements, rather than syntactic require- 
lnents (cf. Steedman, 1989), 
One case where the dynamic grammars correctly 
violate tile substring hypothesis is when a string al- 
ready involves a coordination, lIere, the internal st;a- 
tes arc not aecessible, so we can't  get interleaving of 
two coordinations, as in: 
29) * The girl and tile or the boy and the adult came 
'\]'here may be an argument for similarly blocking co- 
ordinat ion in cases which would involve the breaking 
apart of idioms or ot her structures which are nol; Stall- 
dm:d eases of lexical Sld)categorisation. An example 
(due to Mark Steedman), which may be sneh a case, 
is the following, 
30) * One lnan ill \[ten spoke against and twenty ac- 
t ually protested\] 
As noted above, the precise granunaticalil;y predic- 
tions depend on the kind of parsing lnodel which is en- 
coded in the states. In Milward (1992a), the dynarnics 
specifies a word-by-word incremental parser lbr a lexi- 
calised version of dependency gramlnar. Fach state is 
a recursively defined category, similar to ~/cal;egory in 
Categorial Gramlnar. For exarnple, after parsing You 
can call me one possible state is a sentence missing a 
sentence lnoditier 1?. This state is appropriate as the 
initial state R~r a parse of both dirccll?/, or of after 
,Tpm thro,ugh my sccTvtary, resulting in a final state 
of category sentence. Thus examples Stlch as (19a) 
are dealt with, since the syntactic context after You 
can call me dots not distingnish between one or lnore 
than one subsequent modilier. This lack of distinc- 
tion as to whethel: one or lnore modilier is expected 
is actually a necessary prereqnisite \['or performing de- 
cidable fl,lly word-by-word incremental interpretation 
(see Milward and Cooper, 1994, in these proceedings). 
Some of the problelns with eategorial granlmar ac- 
counts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic ac- 
connt based on the parser used ill Milward (1992a). 
For exaniple, 
31) \[,/ohn\] and \[Mary thought hat l'eter\] slept 
is predicted to 1oe a(x:eptable, as are the following, 
32) a \['lbd~ w John\] and \[mary thonght that Peter\] 
slept 
I/ I he.ard \[that\] and \[that no-one else knew that\] 
Fred won the seholarship 
This second batch of examples is particularly dillicult 
to exclude withont malting changes to the eharacteri- 
sation of the states. A feature I>lus or lninns tensed 
vel% on each conjlmet does block them, but is difl-icnlt 
to motivate. 
I)ynanlie grammars can be regarded Imrely as for- 
real systems, as direct representations of proeessing, 
or as something inbetween (for example, ill the packed
