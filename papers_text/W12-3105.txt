Abstract
We present TerrorCat, a submission to the
WMT?12 metrics shared task. TerrorCat uses
frequencies of automatically obtained transla-
tion error categories as base for pairwise com-
parison of translation hypotheses, which is in
turn used to generate a score for every trans-
lation. The metric shows high overall corre-
lation with human judgements on the system
level and more modest results on the level of
individual sentences.
1 The Idea
Recently a couple of methods of automatic trans-
lation error analysis have emerged (Zeman et al,
2011; Popovic? and Ney, 2011). Initial experiments
have shown that while agreement with human error
analysis is low, these methods show better perfor-
mance on tasks with a lower granularity, e.g. ranking
error categories by frequency (Fishel et al, 2012).
In this work we apply translation error analysis to a
task with an even lower granularity: ranking transla-
tions, one of the shared tasks of WMT?12.
The aim of translation error analysis is to identify
the errors that translation systems make and catego-
rize them into different types: e.g. lexical, reorder-
ing, punctuation errors, etc. The two tools that we
will use ? Hjerson and Addicter ? both rely on a ref-
erence translation. The hypothesis translation that is
being analyzed is first aligned to the reference on the
word level, and then mistranslated, misplaced, mis-
inflected, missing or superfluous words and other er-
rors are identified.
The main idea of our work is to quantify trans-
lation quality based on the frequencies of different
error categories. The basic assumption is that differ-
ent error categories have different importance from
the point of view of overall translation quality: for
instance, it would be natural to assume that punc-
tuation errors influence translation quality less than
missing words or lexical choice errors. Furthermore,
an error category can be more important for one out-
put language than the other: for example, word or-
der can influence the meaning in an English sentence
more than in a Czech or German one, whereas in-
flection errors are probably more frequent in the lat-
ter two and can thus cause more damage.
In the context of the ranking task, the absolute
value of a numeric score has no importance, apart
from being greater than, smaller than or equal to the
other systems? scores. We therefore start by per-
forming pairwise comparison of the translations ?
the basic task is to compare two translations and re-
port which one is better. To conform with the WMT
submission format we need to generate a numeric
score as the output ? which is obtained by compar-
ing every possible pair of translations and then using
the (normalized) total number of wins per translation
as its final score.
The general architecture of the metric is thus this:
? automatic error analysis is applied to the sys-
tem outputs, yielding the frequencies of every
error category for each sentence
? every possible pair of all system outputs is rep-
resented as a vector of features, based on the
error category frequencies
64
? a binary classifier takes these feature vectors as
input and assigns a win to one of the sentences
in every pair (apart from ties)
? the final score of a system equals to the normal-
ized total number of wins per sentence
? the system-level score is averaged out over the
individual sentence scores
An illustrative example is given in Figure 1.
We call the result TerrorCat, the translation error
categorization-based metric.
2 The Details
In this section we will describe the specifics of
the current implementation of the TerrorCat met-
ric: translation error analysis, lemmatization, binary
classifier and training data for the binary classifier.
2.1 Translation Error Analysis
Addicter (Zeman et al, 2011) and Hjerson (Popovic?
and Ney, 2011) use different methods for automatic
error analysis. Addicter explicitly aligns the hy-
pothesis and reference translations and induces error
categories based on the alignment coverage while
Hjerson compares words encompassed in the WER
(word error rate) and PER (position-independent
word error rate) scores to the same end.
Previous evaluation of Addicter shows that
hypothesis-reference alignment coverage (in terms
of discovered word pairs) directly influences er-
ror analysis quality; to increase alignment cover-
age we used Berkeley aligner (Liang et al, 2006)
and trained it on and applied it to the whole set of
reference-hypothesis pairs for every language pair.
Both tools use word lemmas for their analysis;
we used TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) for analyzing
English, Spanish, German and French and Morc?e
(Spoustova? et al, 2007) to analyze Czech. The same
tools are used for PoS-tagging in some experiments.
2.2 Binary Classification
Pairwise comparison of sentence pairs is achieved
with a binary SVM classifier, trained via sequential
minimal optimization (Platt, 1998), implemented in
Weka (Hall et al, 2009).
The input feature vectors are composed of fre-
quency differences of every error category; since the

maximum (normalized) frequency of any error rate
is 1, the feature value range is [?1, 1]. To include
error analysis from both Addicter and Hjerson their
respective features are used side-by-side.
2.3 Data Extraction
Training data for the SVM classifier is taken from
the WMT shared task manual ranking evaluations
of previous years (2007?2011), which consist of tu-
ples of 2 to 5 ranked sentences for every language
pair. Equal ranks are allowed, and translations of
the same sentence by the same pair of systems can
be present in several tuples, possibly having conflict-
ing comparison results.
To convert the WMT manual ranking data into
the training data for the SVM classifier, we collect
all rankings for each pair of translation hypothe-

ses. Pairs with equal ranks are discarded, conflicting
ranks for the same pairs are resolved with voting. If
the voting is tied, the pair is also discarded.
The kept translation pairs are mirrored (i.e. both
directions of every pair are added to the training set
as independent entries) to ensure no bias towards the
first or second translation in a pair. We will later
present analysis of how well that works.
2.4 TerrorCat+You
TerrorCat is distributed via GitHub; information on
downloading and using it can be found online.1 Ad-
ditionally we are planning to provide more recent
evaluations with new datasets, as well as pre-trained
models for various languages and language pairs.
3 The Experiments
In the experimental part of our work, we search for
the best performing model variant, the aim of which
is to evaluate different input features, score calcula-
tion strategies and other alternations. The search is
done empirically: we evaluate one alternation at a
time, and if it successful, it is added to the system
before proceeding to test further alternations.
Performance of the models is estimated on a held-
out development set, taken from the WMT?11 data;
the training data during the optimization phase is
composed of ranking data from WMT 2007?2010.
In the end we re-trained our system on the whole
data set (WMT 2007?2011) and applied it to the un-
1http://terra.cl.uzh.ch/terrorcat.html
labeled data from this year?s shared task. The result-
ing dataset sizes are given in Table 1.
All of the resulting scores obtained by different
variants of our metric are presented in Tables 2 (for
system-level correlations) and 3 (for sentence-level
correlations), compared to BLEU and other selected
entries in the WMT?11 evaluation shared task. Cor-
relations are computed in the same way as in the
WMT evaluations.
3.1 Model Optimization
The following is a brief description of successful
modifications to the baseline system.
Weighted Wins
In the baseline model, the score of the winning
system in each pairwise comparison is increased by
1. To reduce the impact of low-confidence decisions
of the classifier on the final score we tested replac-
ing the constant rewards to the winning system with
variable ones, proportional to the classifier?s confi-
dence ? a measure of which was obtained by fitting
a logistic regression model to the SVM output.
As the results show, this leads to minor improve-
ments in sentence-level correlation and more notice-
able improvements in system-level correlation (es-
pecially English-French and Czech-English). A pos-
sible explanation for this difference in performance
on different levels is that low classification confi-
dence on the sentence-level does not necessarily af-
fect our ranking for that sentence, but reduces the
impact of that sentence on the system-level ranking.
PoS-Split Features
The original model only makes a difference be-
tween individual error categories as produced by
Hjerson and Addicter. It seems reasonable to assume
that errors may be more or less important, depending
on the part-of-speech of the words they occur in. We
therefore tested using the number of errors per er-
ror category per PoS-tag as input features. In other
words, unlike the baseline, which relied on counts
of missing, misplaced and other erroneous words,
this alternation makes a difference between miss-
ing nouns/verbs/etc., misplaced nouns, misinflected
nouns/adjectives, and so on.
The downside of this approach is that the number
of features is multiplied by the size of the PoS tag

set. Additionally, too specific distinctions can cause
data sparsity, especially on the sentence level.
As shown by the results, PoS-tag splitting of the
features is successful on the system level, but quite
hurtful to the sentence-level correlations. The poor
performance on the sentence level can be attributed
to the aforementioned data sparsity: the number of
different features is higher than the number of words
(and hence, the biggest possible number of errors)
in the sentences. However, we cannot quite ex-
plain, how a sum of these less reliable sentence-level
scores leads to more reliable system-level scores.
To somewhat relieve data sparsity we defined sub-
sets of the original PoS tag sets, mostly leaving out
morphological information and keeping just the gen-
eral word types (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.). This
reduced the number of PoS-tags (and thus, the num-
ber of input features) from 2 to 4 times and produced
further increase in system-level and a smaller de-
crease in sentence-level scores, see GenPoS results.
To avoid splitting the metric into different ver-
sions for system-level and sentence-level, we gave
priority to system-level correlations and adopted the
generalized PoS-splitting of the features.
Out-of-Domain Data
The human ranking data from WMT of previ-
ous years do not constitute a completely homo-
geneous dataset. For starters, the test sets are
taken from different domains (News/News Com-
mentary/Europarl), whereas the 2012 test set is from
the News domain only. Added to this, there might be
a difference in the manual data, coming from differ-
ent organization of the competition ? e.g. WMT?07
was the only year when manual scoring of the trans-
lations with adequacy/fluency was performed, and
ranking had just been introduced into the competi-
tion. Therefore we tested whether some subsets of
the training data can result in better overall scores.
Interestingly enough, leaving out News Commen-
tary and Europarl test sets caused decreased correla-
tions, although these account for just around 10%
of the training data. On the other hand, leaving out
the data from WMT?07 led to a significant gain in
overall performance.
3.2 Error Meta-Analysis
To better understand why sentence-level correlations
are low, we analyzed the core of TerrorCat ? its pair-
wise classifier. Here, we focus on the most success-
ful variant of the metric, which uses general PoS-
tags and was trained on the WMT manual rankings
from 2008 to 2010. Table 4 presents the confusion
matrices of the classifier (one for precision and one
for recall), taking into consideration the confidence
estimate.
Evaluation is based on the data from 2011; the
prediction data was mirrored in the same way as for

the training set. Our aim was to measure the bias
of the classifier towards first or second translations
in a pair (which is obviously an undesired effect).
It can be seen that the confusion matrices are com-
pletely symmetrical, indicating no position bias of
the classifier ? even lower-confidence decisions are
absolutely consistent.
To make sure that this can be attributed to the mir-
roring of the training set, we re-trained the classifier
on non-mirrored training sets. As a result, 9% of the
instances were labelled inconsistently, with the av-
erage confidence of such inconsistent decisions be-
ing extremely low (2.1%, compared to the overall
average of 28.4%). The resulting correlations have
slightly dropped as well ? all indicating that mirror-
ing the training sets does indeed remove the posi-
tional bias and leads to slightly better performance.
Looking at the confusion matrices overall, most
decisions fall within the main diagonals (i.e. the
cells indicating correct decisions of the classifier).
Looking strictly at the classifier?s decisions, the re-
calls and precisions of the non-tied comparison out-
puts (?<? and ?>?) are 57% precision, 69% recall.
However, such strict estimates are too pessimistic in
our case, since the effect of the classifier?s decisions
is proportional to the confidence estimate. On the
sentence level it means that low-confidence decision
errors have less effect on the total score of a system.
A definite source of error is the instability of the in-
dividual translation errors on the sentence level, an
effect both Addicter and Hjerson are known to suffer
from (Fishel et al, 2012).
The precision of the classifier predictably drops
together with the confidence, and almost half of the
misclassifications come from unrecognized equiva-
lent translations ? as a result the recall of such pairs
of equivalent translations is only 20%. This can be
explained by the fact that the binary classifier was
trained on instances with just these two labels and
with no ties allowed.
On the other hand the classifier?s 0-confidence de-
cisions have a high precision (84%) on detecting the
equivalent translations; after re-examining the data
it turned out that 96% of the 0-confidence decisions
were made on input feature vectors containing only
zero frequency differences. Such vectors represent
pairs of sentences with identical translation error
analyses, which are very often simply identical sen-
tences ? in which case the classifier cannot (and in
fact, should not) make an informed decision of one
being better than the other.
4 Related Work
Traditional MT metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002) are based on a comparison of the trans-
lation hypothesis to one or more human references.
TerrorCat still uses a human reference to extract fea-
tures from the error analysis with Addicter and Hjer-
son, but at the core, TerrorCat compares hypotheses
not to a reference, but to each other.

It is thus most similar to SVM-RANK and Tesla
metrics, submissions to the WMT?10 shared met-
rics task (Callison-Burch et al, 2010) which also
used SVMs for ranking translations. However, both
metrics used SVMrank (Joachims, 2006) directly for
ranking (unlike TerrorCat, which uses a binary clas-
sifier for pairwise comparisons). Their features in-
cluded some of the metric outputs (BLEU, ROUGE,
etc.) for SVM-RANK and similarity scores between
bags of n-grams for Tesla (Dahlmeier et al, 2011).
5 Conclusions
We introduced the TerrorCat metric, which performs
pairwise comparison of translation hypotheses based
on frequencies of automatically obtained error cate-
gories using a binary classifier, trained on manually
ranked data. The comparison outcome is then con-
verted to a numeric score for every sentence or doc-
ument translation by averaging out the number of
wins per translation system.
Our submitted system achieved an average
system-level correlation with human judgements in
the WMT?11 development set of 0.86 for transla-
tion into English and 0.85 for translations from En-
glish into other languages. Particularly good per-
formance was achieved on translations from English
into Czech (0.90) and back (0.95). Sentence-level
scores are more modest: average 0.27 for transla-
tion into English and 0.23 for those out of English.
The scores remain to be checked against the human
judgments from WMT?12.
The introduced TerrorCat metric has certain de-
pendencies. For one thing, in order to apply it to
new languages, a training set of manual rankings is
required ? although this can be viewed as an advan-
tage, since it enables the user to tune the metric to
his/her own preference. Additionally, the metric de-
pends on lemmatization and PoS-tagging.
There is a number of directions to explore in the
future. For one, both Addicter and Hjerson report
MT errors related more to adequacy than fluency, al-
though it was shown last year (Parton et al, 2011)
that fluency is an important component in rating
translation quality. It is also important to test how
well the metric performs if lemmatization and PoS-
tagging are not available.
For this year?s competition, training data was
taken separately for every language pair; it remains
to be tested whether combining human judgements
with the same target language and different source
languages leads to better or worse performance.
To conclude, we have described TerrorCat, one
of the submissions to the metrics shared task of
WMT?12. TerrorCat is rather demanding to apply on
one hand, having more requirements than the com-
mon reference-hypothesis translation pair, but at the
same time correlates rather well with human judge-
ments on the system level.
