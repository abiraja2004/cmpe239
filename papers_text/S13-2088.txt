Abstract
This paper describes an expression-level senti-
ment detection system that participated in the
subtask A of SemEval-2013 Task 2: Senti-
ment Analysis in Twitter. Our system uses a
supervised approach to learn the features from
the training data to classify expressions in new
tweets as positive, negative or neutral. The
proposed approach helps to understand the rel-
evant features that contribute most in this clas-
sification task.
1 Introduction
In recent years, Twitter has emerged as an ubiquitous
and an opportune platform for social activity. Ana-
lyzing the sentiments of the tweets expressed by an
international user-base can provide an approximate
view of how people feel. One of the biggest chal-
lenges of working with tweets is their short length.
Additionally, the language used in tweets is very
informal, with creative spellings and punctuation,
misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-
specific terminology and abbreviations, such as, RT
for ?re-tweet? and #hashtags, which are a type of
tagging for tweets. Although several systems tackle
the task of analyzing sentiments from tweets, the
task of analyzing sentiments at term or phrase-level
within a tweet has remained largely unexplored.
This paper describes the details of our expression-
level sentiment detection system that participated in
the subtask A of SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter (Wilson et al, 2013). The goal
is to mark expressions (a term or short phrases) in
a tweet with their contextual polarity. This is chal-
lenging given the fact that the entire length of a tweet
is restricted to just 140 characters. We describe the
creation of an SVM classifier that is used to classify
the contextual polarity of expressions within tweets.
A feature set derived from various linguistic fea-
tures, parts-of-speech tagging and prior sentiment
lexicons was used to train the classifier.
2 Related Work
Sentiment detection from Twitter data has attracted
much attention from the research community in re-
cent times (Go et al, 2009; Pang et al, 2002; Pang
and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al, 2005; T. et al, 2012).
However, most of these approaches classify entire
tweets by their overall sentiment (positive, negative
or neutral).
The task at hand is to classify expressions with
their contextual sentiment. Most of these expres-
sions can be found in sentiment lexicons already an-
notated with their general polarity, but the focus of
this task is to detect the polarity of that expression
within the context of the tweet it appears in, and
therefore, given the context, the polarity of the ex-
pression might differ from that found in any lexicon.
One of the primary goals of this task is to facilitate
the creation of a corpus of tweets with sentiment ex-
pressions marked with their contextual sentiments.
Wilson, Wiebe and Hoffman (Wilson et al, 2005)
explored the challenges of contextual polarity of
sentiment expressions by first determining whether
an expression is neutral or polar and then disam-
biguating the polarity of the polar expressions. Na-
sukawa and Yi (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003) classified
530
the polarity of target expressions using manually de-
veloped patterns. Both these approaches, however,
experimented with general webpages and online re-
views but not Twitter data.
3 Task Setup
This paper describes the task of recognizing con-
textual sentiments of expressions within a tweet.
Formally, given a message containing a marked in-
stance of a word or a phrase, the task is to determine
whether that instance is positive, negative or neutral
in that context.
A corpus of roughly 8343 twitter messages was
made available by the task organizers, where each
tweet included an expression marked as positive,
negative or neutral. Also available was a develop-
ment data set containing 1011 tweets with similarly
marked expressions. The data sets included mes-
sages on a broad range of topics such as a mix-
ture of entities (e.g., Gadafi, Steve Jobs), products
(e.g., kindle, android phone), and events (e.g., Japan
earthquake, NHL playoffs). Keywords and hashtags
were used to identify and collect messages relevant
to the selected topic, which were then annotated us-
ing Mechanical Turk. Further details regarding the
task setup may be found in the task description paper
(Wilson et al, 2013).
The evaluation consisted of classifying 4435 ex-
pressions in a Twitter data set. Furthermore, to test
the generalizability of the systems, the task organiz-
ers provided a test data set consisting of 2334 SMS
messages, each containing a marked expression, for
which no prior training data set was made available.
4 System Description
Our aim by participating in the SemEval-2013 Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter task was to investigate
what features are most useful in distinguishing the
different polarities. The various steps of building our
system are described in detail as follows.
4.1 Tokenization
Tweets are known for being notoriously noisy due
to their length restricted to just 140 characters which
forces users to be creative in order to get their mes-
sages across. This poses an inherent challenge when
analyzing tweets which need to undergo some sig-
nificant preprocessing. The first step includes tok-
enizing the words in the tweet. Punctuation is identi-
fied during the tokenization process and marked for
inclusion as one of the features in the feature set.
This includes Twitter-specific punctuation such as
?#? hashtags, specific emoticons such as ?:)? and
any URL links are replaced by a ?URL? placeholder.
4.2 n-gram features
Each expression consists of one or more words, with
the average number of words in an expression in the
training data set found to be 2. We derive lower-case
unigram and bigram as well as the full string features
from the expressions which are represented by their
frequency counts in the feature set. The n-grams
were cleaned (stripped of any punctuation) before
being included in the feature set as they were ob-
served to provide better results than noisy n-grams.
Note that the presence of punctuation did become a
part of the feature set as described in 4.3. We also
experimented with word-splitting, especially found
in hashtags (e.g., #iamsohappy); however, contrary
to our initial supposition, this step resulted in poorer
results overall due to word-splitting error propaga-
tion and was therefore avoided.
4.3 POS tagging
For tagging the various parts-of-speech of a tweet,
we use the POS tagger (Gimpel et al, 2011) that is
especially designed to work with English data from
Twitter. The tagging scheme encompasses 25 tags
(please see (Gimpel et al, 2011) for the full listing),
including some Twitter-specific tags (which could
make up as much as 13% of all tags as shown in
their annotated data set) such as ?#? hashtag (indi-
cates topic/category for tweet), ?@? at-mention (in-
dicates another user as a recipient of a tweet), ?RT?
re-tweets and URL or email addresses. The punctu-
ation (such as ?:-)?, ?:b?, ?(:?, amongst others) from
the n-grams is captured using the ?emoticon? and
?punctuation? tags that are explicitly identified by
this POS tagger trained especially for tweets.
Table 1 shows an example using a subset of two
POS tags for an expression (# Adj. and # Emoti-
con denotes the number of adjectives and emoticons
respectively). Other POS tags include nouns (NN),
verbs (VB) and so on. Features incorporating the
information about the parts-of-speech of the expres-

Pos. Neg. Exp. Tweet #Adj. #Emoticon #Adj. #NN ?without? ?star? ?without star? ...
0 0 3 23 0 0 1 13 1 1 1 ...
Table 1: Sample feature set for an expression (denoted in bold)
sion as well as the tweet denoted by their frequencies
produced better results than using a binary notation.
Hence frequency counts were used in the feature set.
4.4 Prior sentiment lexicon
A prior sentiment lexicon was generated by combin-
ing four already existing polarity lexicons including
the Opinion Lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004), the Sen-
tiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), the Subjec-
tivity Clues database (Wilson et al, 2005) and the
General Inquirer (Stone and Hunt, 1963). If any
of the words in the expression are also found in the
prior sentiment lexicon, then the frequencies of such
prior positive and negative words are included as
features in the feature set.
4.5 Other features
Other features found to be useful in the classification
process include the length of the expression as well
as the length of the tweet. A sample of the feature
set is shown in Table 1.
4.6 Classifier
During development time, we experimented with
different classifiers but in the end, the Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM), using the polynomial kernel,
trained over tweets from the provided train and de-
velopment data outperformed all the other classi-
fiers. The final feature set included four main fea-
tures plus the n-grams as well as the features depict-
ing the presence or absence of a POS in the expres-
sion and the tweet.
5 Experiments and Discussion
The task organizers made available a test data set
composed of 4435 tweets where each tweet con-
tained an instance of an expression whose sentiment
was to be detected. Another test corpus of 2334
SMS messages was also used in the evaluation to
test how well a system trained on tweets generalizes
on other data types.
The metric for evaluating the systems is F-
measure. We participated in the ?constrained? ver-
sion of the task which meant working with only the
provided training data and no additional tweets/SMS
messages or sentences with sentiment annotations
were used. However, other resources such as sen-
timent lexicons can be incorporated into the system.
Table 2, which presents the results of our submis-
sion in this task, lists the F-score of the positive,
negative and neutral classes on the Twitter test data,
whereas Table 3 lists the results of the SMS mes-
sage data. As it can be observed from the results,
the negative sentiments are classified better than the
positive ones. We reckon this may be due to the
comparatively fewer ways of expressing a positive
emotion, while the negative sentiment seems to have
a much wider vocabulary (our sentiment lexicon has
25% less positive words than negative). Whereas
the positive class has a higher precision, the nega-
tive class seems to have a more notable recall. The
most striking observation, however, is the extremely
low F-score for the neutral class. This may be due to
the highly skewed proportion (less than 5%) of neu-
tral instances in the training data. In future work, it
will be interesting to see how balancing out the pro-
portions of the three classes affects the classification
accuracy.
We also ran some ablation experiments on the
provided Twitter and SMS test data sets after the
submission. Table 4 reports the findings of exper-
iments where, for example, ?- prior polarities? in-
dicates a feature set excluding the prior polarities.
The metric used here is the macro-averaged F-score
of the positive and the negative class. The baseline
measure implements a simple SVM classifier using
only the words as unigram features in the expres-
sion. Interestingly, contrary to our hypothesis dur-
532
ing development time, using the POS of the entire
tweet was the least helpful feature. Since this was
an expression level classification task, it seems that
using the POS features of the entire tweet may mis-
guide the classifier. Unsurprisingly, the prior po-
larities turned out to be the most important part of
the feature set for this classification task as it seems
that many of the expressions? contextual polarities
remained same as their prior polarities.

6 Conclusion
This paper presented the details of our system which
participated in the subtask A of SemEval-2013 Task
2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. An SVM classifier
was trained on a feature set consiting of prior po-
larities, various POS and other Twitter-specific fea-
tures. Our experiments indicate that prior polari-
ties from sentiment lexicons are significant features
in this expression level classification task. Further-
more, a classifier trained on just tweets can general-
ize considerably well on SMS message data as well.
As part of our future work, we would like to explore
what features are more helpful in not only classify-
ing the positive class better, but also distinguishing
neutrality from polarity.
