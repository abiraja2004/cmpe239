Abstract
Recent research on multilingual statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) focuses on the usage
of pivot languages in order to overcome re-
source limitations for certain language pairs.
This paper proposes a new method to translate
a dialect language into a foreign language by
integrating transliteration approaches based
on Bayesian co-segmentation (BCS) models
with pivot-based SMT approaches. The ad-
vantages of the proposed method with respect
to standard SMT approaches are three fold:
(1) it uses a standard language as the pivot lan-
guage and acquires knowledge about the re-
lation between dialects and the standard lan-
guage automatically, (2) it reduces the transla-
tion task complexity by using monotone de-
coding techniques, (3) it reduces the num-
ber of features in the log-linear model that
have to be estimated from bilingual data. Ex-
perimental results translating four Japanese
dialects (Kumamoto, Kyoto, Okinawa, Os-
aka) into four Indo-European languages (En-
glish, German, Russian, Hindi) and two Asian
languages (Chinese, Korean) revealed that
the proposed method improves the translation
quality of dialect translation tasks and outper-
forms standard pivot translation approaches
concatenating SMT engines for the majority
of the investigated language pairs.
1 Introduction
The translation quality of SMT approaches heavily
depends on the amount and coverage of the bilin-
gual language resources available to train the statis-
tical models. There are several data collection ini-
tiatives1 amassing and distributing large amounts of
textual data. For frequently used language pairs like
French-English, large-sized text data sets are read-
ily available. However, for less frequently used lan-
guage pairs, only a limited amount of bilingual re-
sources are available, if any at all.
In order to overcome language resource limi-
tations, recent research on multilingual SMT fo-
cuses on the use of pivot languages (de Gispert and
Marino, 2006; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and
Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al, 2008; Koehn et al,
2009). Instead of a direct translation between two
languages where only a limited amount of bilingual
resources is available, the pivot translation approach
makes use of a third language that is more appropri-
ate due to the availability of more bilingual corpora
and/or its relatedness to the source/target language.
In most of the previous research, English has been
the pivot language of choice due to the richness of
available language resources. However, recent re-
search on pivot translation has shown that the usage
of non-English pivot languages can improve trans-
lation quality of certain language pairs, especially
when translating from or into Asian languages (Paul
et al, 2009).
This paper focuses on the translation of dialects,
i.e., a variety of a language that is characteristic of
a particular group of the language?s speakers, into
a foreign language. A standard dialect (or stan-
dard language) is a dialect that is recognized as
the ?correct? spoken and written form of the lan-
guage. Dialects typically differ in terms of mor-
phology, vocabulary and pronunciation. Various

methods have been proposed to measure relatedness
between dialects using phonetic distance measures
(Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997), string distance al-
gorithms (Heeringa et al, 2006; Scherrer, 2007), or
statistical models (Chitturi and Hansen, 2008).
Concerning data-driven natural language process-
ing (NLP) applications like machine translation
(MT), however, linguistic resources and tools usu-
ally are available for the standard language, but not
for dialects. In order to create dialect language re-
sources, previous research utilized explicit knowl-
edge about the relation between the standard lan-
guage and the dialect using rule-based and statistical
models (Habash et al, 2005; Sawaf, 2010). In addi-
tion, applying the linguistic tools for the standard
language to dialect resources is often insufficient.
For example, the task of word segmentation, i.e.,
the identification of word boundaries in continuous
text, is one of the fundamental preprocessing steps
of MT applications. In contrast to Indo-European
languages like English, many Asian languages like
Japanese do not use a whitespace character to sep-
arate meaningful word units. However, the applica-
tion of a linguistically motivated standard language
word segmentation tool to a dialect corpus results
in a poor segmentation quality due to morphological
differences in verbs and adjectives, thus resulting in
a lower translation quality for SMT systems that ac-
quire the translation knowledge automatically from
a parallel text corpus (Paul et al, 2011).
This paper differs from previous research in the
following aspects:
? it reduces the data sparseness problem of di-
rect translation approaches by translating a
resource-limited dialect language into a foreign
language by using the resource-rich standard
language as the pivot language.
? it is language independent and acquires knowl-
edge about the relation between the standard
language and the dialect automatically.
? it avoids segmentation mismatches between the
input and the translation model by mapping the
characterized dialect language, i.e., each char-
acter is treated as a single token, to the word
segmentation of the standard language using a
Bayesian co-segmentation model.
? it reduces the translation task complexity by us-
ing monotone decoding techniques.
? it reduces the number of features in the log-
linear model that have to be estimated from
bilingual data.
The details of the proposed dialect translation
method are described in Section 2. Experiments
were carried out for the translation of four Japanese
dialects (Kumamoto, Kyoto, Okinawa, Osaka) into
four Indo-European languages (English, German,
Russian, Hindi) and two Asian languages (Chinese,
Korean). The utilized language resources and the
outline of the experiments are summarized in Sec-
tion 3. The results reveal that the integration of
Bayesian co-segmentation models with pivot-based
SMT improves the translation quality of dialect to
foreign language translation tasks and that the pro-
posed system outperforms standard pivot translation
approaches concatenating SMT engines that trans-
late the dialect into the standard language and the
standard language MT output into the foreign lan-
guage for the majority of the investigated language
pairs.
2 Dialect Translation
Spoken language translation technologies attempt to
bridge the language barriers between people with
different native languages who each want to engage
in conversation by using their mother-tongue. For
standard languages, multilingual speech translation
services like the VoiceTra2 system for travel conver-
sations are readily available. However, such tech-
nologies are not capable of dealing with dialect lan-
guages due to the lack of language resources and the
high development costs of building speech transla-
tion components for a large number of dialect varia-
tions.
In order to reduce such problems, the dialect
translation method proposed in this paper integrates
two different methods of transducing a given dialect
input sentence into a foreign language. In the first
step, the close relationship between the local and
standard language is exploited to directly map char-
acter sequences in the dialect input to word seg-
ments in the standard language using a Bayesian co-
2http://mastar.jp/translation/voicetra-en.html

segmentation approach, details of which are given in
Section 2.1. The proposed transliteration method is
described in Section 2.2. The advantages of the pro-
posed Bayesian co-segmentation approach are two
fold: it reduces the translation complexity and it
avoids segmentation inconsistencies between the in-
put and the translation models. In the second step,
a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system trained
on a large amount of bilingual data is applied to ob-
tain high-quality foreign language translations as de-
scribed in Section 2.3.
2.1 Bayesian Co-segmentation
The method for mapping the dialect sentences into
the standard language word segments is a direct
character-to-character mapping between the lan-
guages. This process is known as translitera-
tion. Many transliteration methods have previously
been proposed, including methods based on string-
similarity measures between character sequences
(Noeman and Madkour, 2010) or generation-based
models (Lee and Chang, 2003; Tsuji and Kageura,
2006; Jiampojamarn et al, 2010).
In this paper, we use a generative Bayesian model
similar to the one from (DeNero et al, 2008) which
offers several benefits over standard transliteration
techniques: (1) the technique has the ability to train
models whilst avoiding over-fitting the data, (2)
compact models that have only a small number of
well-chosen parameters are constructed, (3) the un-
derlying generative transliteration model is based on
the joint source-channel model (Li et al, 2004), and
(4) the model is symmetric with respect to source
and target language. Intuitively, the model has two
basic components: a model for generating an out-
come that has already been generated at least once
before, and a second model that assigns a probabil-
ity to an outcome that has not yet been produced.
Ideally, to encourage the re-use of model parame-
ters, the probability of generating a novel bilingual
sequence pair should be considerably lower then the
probability of generating a previously observed se-
quence pair. The probability distribution over these
bilingual sequence pairs (including an infinite num-
ber of unseen pairs) can be learned directly from un-
labeled data by Bayesian inference of the hidden co-
segmentation of the corpus.
The co-segmentation process is driven by a
Dirichlet process, which is a stochastic process de-
fined over a set S (in our case, the set of all pos-
sible bilingual sequence pairs) whose sample path
is a probability distribution on S. The underlying
stochastic process for the generation of a corpus
composed of bilingual phrase pairs (sk,tk) can be
written in the following form:
G|?,G0 ? DP (?,G0)
(sk, tk)|G ? G (1)
G is a discrete probability distribution over all
the bilingual sequence pairs according to a Dirichlet
process prior with a base measure G0 and concen-
tration parameter ?. The concentration parameter
? > 0 controls the variance of G; intuitively, the
larger ? is, the more similar G0 will be to G.
For the base measure that controls the genera-
tion of novel sequence pairs, we use a joint spelling
model that assigns probability to new sequence pairs
according to the following joint distribution:
G0((s, t)) = p(|s|)p(s||s|)? p(|t|)p(t||t|)
= ?
|s|
s
|s|! e
??sv?|s|s ?
?|t|t
|t|! e
??tv?|t|t (2)
where |s| and |t| are the length in characters of
the source and target sides of the bilingual sequence
pair; vs and vt are the vocabulary sizes of the source
and target languages respectively; and ?s and ?t are
the expected lengths3 of the source and target.
According to this model, source and target se-
quences are generated independently: in each case
the sequence length is chosen from a Poisson dis-
tribution, and then the sequence itself is generated
given the length. Note that this model is able to
assign a probability to arbitrary bilingual sequence
pairs of any length in the source and target sequence,
but favors shorter sequences in both.
The generative model is given in Equation 3. The
equation assigns a probability to the kth bilingual
sequence pair (sk, tk) in a derivation of the corpus,
given all of the other sequence pairs in the history so
far (s?k, t?k). Here ?k is read as: ?up to but not
including k?.
p((sk, tk))|(s?k, t?k))
= N((sk, tk)) + ?G0((sk, tk))N + ? (3)
3Following (Xu et al, 2008), we assign the parameters ?s,
?t and ?, the values 2, 2 and 0.3 respectively.

Algorithm 1: Blocked Gibbs Sampling
In this equation, N is the total number of bilingual
sequence pairs generated so far and N((sk, tk)) is
the number of times the sequence pair (sk, tk) has
occurred in the history. G0 and ? are the base mea-
sure and concentration parameter as before.
We used a blocked version of a Gibbs sampler
for training, which is similar to that of (Mochihashi
et al, 2009). We extended their forward filtering
/ backward sampling (FFBS) dynamic programing
algorithm in order to deal with bilingual segmenta-
tions (see Algorithm 1). We found our sampler con-
verged rapidly without annealing. The number of
iterations was set by hand after observing the con-
vergence behavior of the algorithm in pilot experi-
ments. We used a value of 75 iterations through the
corpus in all experiments reported in this paper. For
more details on the Bayesian co-segmentation pro-
cess, please refer to (Finch and Sumita, 2010).
2.2 Dialect to Standard Language
Transduction
A Bayesian segmentation model is utilized to trans-
form unseen dialect sentences into the word seg-
mentation of the standard language by using the
joint-source channel framework proposed by (Li et
al., 2004). The joint-source channel model, also
called the n-gram transliteration model, is a joint
probability model that captures information on how
the source and target sentences can be generated
simultaneously using transliteration pairs, i.e., the
most likely sequence of source characters and tar-
get words according to a joint language model built
from the co-segmentation from the Bayesian model.
Suppose that we have a dialect sentence ? =
l1l2 . . . lL and a standard language sentence ? =
s1s2 . . . sS where li are dialect characters, sj are
word tokens of the standard language, and there
exists an alignment ? =< l1 . . . lq, s1 >, . . . , <
lr . . . lL, sS >, 1 ? q < r ? L of K translitera-
tion units. Then, an n-gram transliteration model is
defined as the transliteration probability of a translit-
eration pair < l, s >k depending on its immediate n
preceding transliteration pairs:
P (?, ?, ?) =
K
?
k=1
P (< l, s >k|< l, s >k?1k?n+1) (4)
For the experiments reported in this paper, we im-
plemented the joint-source channel model approach
as a weighted finite state transducer (FST) using
the OpenFst toolkit (Allauzen et al, 2007). The
FST takes the sequence of dialect characters as its
input and outputs the co-segmented bilingual seg-
ments from which the standard language segments
are extracted.
2.3 Pivot-based SMT
Recent research on speech translation focuses on
corpus-based approaches, and in particular on statis-
tical machine translation (SMT), which is a machine
translation paradigm where translations are gener-
ated on the basis of statistical models whose param-
eters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text
corpora. SMT formulates the problem of translat-
ing a source language sentence src into a target lan-
guage sentence trg as a maximization problem of
the conditional probability:
argmaxtrg p(src|trg) ? p(trg) (5)
where p(src|trg) is called a translation model
(TM ) and represents the generation probability
from trg into src, and p(trg) is called a language
model (LM ) and represents the likelihood of the tar-
get language (Brown et al, 1993). During the trans-
lation process (decoding), a score based on the sta-
tistical model probabilities is assigned to each trans-
lation hypothesis and the one that gives the highest
probability is selected as the best translation.
The translation quality of SMT approaches heav-
ily depends on the amount and coverage of the bilin-
gual language resources available to train the statis-
tical models. In the context of dialect translation,
4
where only few bilingual language resources (if any
at all) are available for the dialect and the foreign
language, only a relatively low translation quality
can be obtained. In order to obtain better transla-
tions, we apply a pivot translation approach. Pivot
translation is the translation from a source language
(SRC) to a target language (TRG) through an inter-
mediate pivot (or bridging) language (PVT). In this
paper, we select the standard language as the pivot
language.
Within the SMT framework, various coupling
strategies like cascading, phrase-table composition,
or pseudo-corpus generation have been proposed.
For the experiments reported in this paper, we uti-
lized the cascading approach because it is compu-
tational less expensive, but still performs compara-
bly well compared to the other pivot translation ap-
proaches. In the first step, the dialect input is tran-
scribed into the standard language as described in
Section 2.1. Next, the obtained standard language
MT output is translated into the target language us-
ing SMT models trained on the much larger lan-
guage resources.
3 Experiments
The effects of integrating Bayesian co-segmentation
models with pivot-based SMT are investigated using
the Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (BTEC), which
is a collection of sentences that bilingual travel ex-
perts consider useful for people traveling abroad
(Kikui et al, 2006). For the dialect translation ex-
periments, we selected Japanese (ja), a language that
does not naturally separate word units, and the di-
alects from the Kumamoto (jaku), Kyoto (jaky), Ok-
inawa (jaok), and Osaka (jaos) areas. All dialects
share the same Japanese writing system that com-
bines logographic Chinese characters and two syl-
labic scripts, i.e., hiragana (used for native Japanese
words) and katakana (used for foreign loanwords
or onomatopoeia). For the target language, we in-
vestigated four Indo-European languages, i.e., En-
glish (en), German (de), Russian (ru), and Hindi
(hi) and two Asian languages, i.e., Chinese (zh)
and Korean (ko). The corpus statistics are summa-
rized in Table 1, where Voc specifies the vocabulary
size and Len the average sentence length of the re-
spective data sets. These languages differ largely

Chinese zh 13,343 6.8 SVO none light
Korean ko 17,246 8.1 SOV phrase moderate
in word order (Order: subject-object-verb (SOV),
subject-verb-object (SVO)), segmentation unit (Unit:
phrase, word, none), and degree of inflection (Infl:
high, moderate, light). Concerning word segmenta-
tion, the corpora were preprocessed using language-
specific word segmentation tools that are widely-
accepted within the MT community for languages
that do not use white spaces to separate word/phrase
tokens, i.e., CHASEN4 for Japanese and ICTCLAS5
for Chinese. For all other languages, simple to-
kenization tools were applied. All data sets were
case-sensitive with punctuation marks preserved.
The language resources were randomly split into
three subsets for the evaluation of translation quality
(eval, 1k sentences), the tuning of the SMT model
weights (dev, 1k sentences) and the training of the
statistical models (train, 160k sentences). For the
dialect languages, a subset of 20k sentences was
used for the training of translation models for all
of the resource-limited language pairs. In order to
avoid word segmentation errors from the standard
language segmentation tool beeing applied to dialect
resources, these models are trained on bitext, where
the local dialect source sentence is characterized and
the target language is segmented using language-
specific segmentation tools.
For the training of the SMT models, standard word
alignment (Och and Ney, 2003) and language mod-
eling (Stolcke, 2002) tools were used. Minimum
error rate training (MERT) was used to tune the de-
coder?s parameters on the dev set using the technique
proposed in (Och and Ney, 2003). For the trans-
lation, an inhouse multi-stack phrase-based decoder
was used. For the evaluation of translation quality,
we applied the standard automatic evaluation metric

tween 0 (worst) and 1 (best) (Papineni et al, 2002).
For the experiments reported here, single translation
references were used.
3.1 Direct Translation
Table 2 summarizes the translation performance of
the SMT engines used to directly translate the source
language dialects into the foreign language. For
the large training data condition (160k), the high-
est BLEU scores are obtained for the translation of
Japanese into Korean followed by English, German,
Russian, and Hindi with Chinese seeming to be the
most difficult translation task out of the investigated
target languages. For the standard language (ja), the
translation quality for the small data condition (20k)
that corresponds to the language resources used for
the translation of the dialect languages is also given.
For the Asian target languages, gains of 11%?14%
BLEU points are obtained when increasing the train-
ing data size from 20k to 160k. However, an even
larger increase (24%?27% BLEU points) in trans-
lation quality can be seen for all Indo-European tar-
get languages. Therefore, larger gains are to be
expected when the pivot translation framework is
applied to the translation of dialect languages into
Indo-European languages compared to Asian target
languages. Comparing the evaluation results for the
small training data condition, the highest scores are
achieved for the standard language for all target lan-
guages, indicating the difficulty in translating the di-
alects. Moreover, the Kumamoto dialect seems to be
the easiest task, followed by the Kyoto dialect and
the Osaka dialect. The lowest BLEU scores were

3.2 SMT-based Pivot Translation
The SMT engines of Table 2 are then utilized within
the framework of the SMT-based pivot translation
by (1) translating the dialect input into the stan-
dard language using the SMT engines trained on the
20k data sets and (2) translating the standard lan-
guage MT output into the foreign language using
the SMT engines trained on the 160k data sets. The
translation quality of the SMT-based pivot transla-
tion experiments are summarized in Table 3. Large
gains of 6.2%?25.4% BLEU points compared to
the direct translation results are obtained for all in-
vestigated language pairs, showing the effectiveness
of pivot translation approaches for resource-limited
language pairs. The largest gains are obtained for
jaku, followed by jaos, jaky, and jaok. Therefore, the
easier the translation task, the larger the improve-
ments of the pivot translation approach.
3.3 Bayesian Co-segmentation Model
The proposed method differs from the standard pivot
translation approach in that a joint-source channel
transducer trained from a Bayesian co-segmentation
of the training corpus is used to transliterate the di-
alect input into the standard language, as described
in Section 2.2. This process generates the co-
segmented bilingual segments simultaneously in a
monotone way, i.e., the order of consecutive seg-
ments on the source side as well as on the target side
are the same. Similarly, the decoding process of the
SMT approaches can also be carried out monotoni-
cally. In order to investigate the effect of word order
differences for the given dialect to standard language
transduction task, Table 4 compares the transla-
tion performance of SMT approaches with (reorder-

ing) and without (monotone) distortion models to
the monotone Bayesian co-segmentation approach
(BCS). Only minor differences between SMT decod-
ing with and without reordering are obtained. This
shows that the grammatical structure of the dialect
sentences and the standard language sentences are
very similar, thus justifying the usage of monotone
decoding strategies for the given task. The compari-
son of the SMT-based and the BCS-based transduc-
tion of the dialect sentences into the standard lan-
guage shows that the Bayesian co-segmentation ap-
proach outperforms the SMT approach significantly,
gaining 1.9% / 2.2% / 3.2% / 6.1% BLEU points for
jaky / jaos / jaku / jaok, respectively.
3.4 BCS-based Pivot Translation
The translation quality of the proposed method,
i.e. the integration of the Bayesian co-segmentation
models into the pivot translation framework, are
given in Table 5. The overall gains of the proposed
method compared to (a) the direct translation ap-
proach (see Table 2) and (b) the SMT-based pivot
translation approach (see Table 3) are summarized in
Table 6. The results show that the BCS-based pivot
translation approach also largely outperforms the
direct translation approach, gaining 5.9%?25.3%
BLEU points. Comparing the two pivot translation
approaches, the proposed BCS-based pivot transla-
tion method gains up to 0.8% BLEU points over
the concatenation of SMT engines for the Indo-
European target languages, but is not able to im-
prove the translation quality for translating into Ko-
rean and Chinese. Interestingly, the SMT-based
pivot translation approach seems to be better for lan-
guage pairs where only small relative gains from the
pivot translation approach are achieved when trans-
lating the dialect into a foreign language. For exam-
ple, Korean is a language closely related to Japanese
and the SMT models from the small data condition
already seem to cover enough information to suc-

In the case of Chinese, the translation quality for
even the large data condition SMT engines is rela-
tively low. Therefore, improving the quality of the
standard language input might have only a small im-
pact on the overall pivot translation performance, if
any at all. On the other hand, the proposed method
can be successfully applied for the translation of lan-
guage pairs where structural differences have a large
impact on the translation quality. In such a transla-
tion task, the more accurate transduction of the di-
alect structure into the standard language can affect
the overall translation performance positively.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new dialect transla-
tion method for resource-limited dialect languages
within the framework of pivot translation. In the first
step, a Bayesian co-segmentation model is learned
to transduce character sequences in the dialect sen-
tences into the word segmentation of the standard
7
language. Next, an FST-based joint-source channel
model is applied to unseen dialect input sentences to
monotonically generate co-segmented bilingual seg-
ments from which the standard language segments
are extracted. The obtained pivot sentence is then
translated into the foreign language using a state-of-
the-art phrase-based SMT engine trained on a large
corpus.
Experiments were carried out for the translation
of four Japanese dialects into four Indo-European
as well as into two Asian languages. The re-
sults revealed that the Bayesian co-segmentation
method largely improves the quality of the stan-
dard language sentence generated from a dialect in-
put compared to SMT-based translation approaches.
Although significant improvements of up to 0.8%
in BLEU points are achieved for certain target
languages, such as all of the investigated Indo-
European languages, it is difficult to transfer the
gains obtained by the Bayesian co-segmentation
model to the outcomes for the pivot translation
method.
Further research will have to investigate features
like language relatedness, structural differences,
and translation model complexity to identify indica-
tors of translation quality that could enable the selec-
tion of BCS-based vs. SMT-based pivot translation
approaches for specific language pairs to improve
the overall system performance further.
In addition we would like to investigate the ef-
fects of using the proposed method for translating
foreign languages into dialect languages. As the
Bayesian co-segmentation model is symmetric with
respect to source and target language, we plan to
reuse the models learned for the experiments pre-
sented in this paper and hope to obtain new insights
into the robustness of the Bayesian co-segmentation
method when dealing with noisy data sets like ma-
chine translation outputs.
