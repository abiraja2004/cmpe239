Abstract
The correct choice of words has proven chal-
lenging for learners of a second language and
errors of this kind form a separate category
in error typology. This paper focuses on one
known example of two verbs that are often
confused by non-native speakers of Germanic
languages, to make and to do. We conduct ex-
periments using syntactic information and im-
mediate context for Dutch and English. Our
results show that the methods exploiting syn-
tactic information and distributional similarity
yield the best results.
1 Introduction
When learning a second language, non-native speak-
ers make errors at all levels of linguistic analy-
sis, from pronunciation and intonation to language
use. Word choice errors form a substantial part
of all errors made by learners and may also be
observed in writing or speech of native speak-
ers. This category of errors includes homophones.
Some commonly known confusions in English are
accept-except, advice-advise, buy-by-bye, ate-eight,
to name but a few. Other errors can be explained
by a non-native speaker?s inability to distinguish be-
tween words because there exists only one corre-
sponding word in their native language. For ex-
ample, Portuguese and Spanish speakers have diffi-
culties to differentiate between te doen (to do) and
te maken (to make), and Turkish between kunnen
(can), weten (to know) and kennen (to know) in
Dutch (Coenen et al., 1979). Adopting terminol-
ogy from Golding and Roth (1999) and Rozovskaya
and Roth (2010), do/make and kunnen/kennen/weten
form two confusion sets. However, unlike the case
of kunnen/kennen/weten, where the correct choice is
often determined by syntactic context 1, the choice
between to make and to do can be motivated by
semantic factors. It has been argued in the litera-
ture that the correct use of these verbs depends on
what is being expressed: to do is used to refer to
daily routines and activities, while to make is used to
describe constructing or creating something. Since
word choice errors have different nature, we hypoth-
esize that there may exist no uniform approach to
correct them.
State-of-the-art spell-checkers are able to detect
spelling and agreement errors but fail to find words
used incorrectly, e.g. to distinguish to make from to
do. Motivated by the implications that the correct
prediction of two verbs of interest may have for au-
tomatic error correction, we model the problem of
choosing the correct verb in a similar vein to selec-
tional preferences. The latter has been considered
for a variety of applications, e. g. semantic role la-
beling (Zapirain et al., 2009). Words such as be or
do have been often excluded from consideration be-
cause they are highly polysemous and ?do not select
strongly for their arguments? (McCarthy and Car-
roll, 2003). In this paper, we study whether semantic
classes of arguments may be used to determine the
correct predicate (e.g., to make or to do) and con-
sider the following research questions:
1. Can information on semantic classes of direct
1Kunnen is a modal verb followed by the main verb, kennen
takes a direct object as in, e.g., to know somebody, and weten is
often followed by a clause (as in I know that).

objects potentially help to correct verb choice
errors?
2. How do approaches using contextual and syn-
tactic information compare when predicting to
make vs. to do?
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2.1
discusses the methods, followed by Section 2.2 on
data. The experimental findings are presented in
Section 2.3. We conclude in Section 3.
2 Experiments
We re-examine several approaches to selectional
preferences in the context of error correction. Ex-
isting methods fall into one of two categories, either
those relying on information from WordNet (Mc-
Carthy and Carroll, 2003), or data-driven (Erk,
2007; Schulte im Walde, 2010; Pado et al., 2007).
For the purpose of our study, we focus on the latter.
2.1 Methods
For each verb in question, we have a frequency-
based ranking list of nouns co-occurring with it
(verb-object pairs) which we use for the first two
methods.
Latent semantic clustering (LSC) Rooth et
al. (1999) have proposed a soft-clustering method to
determine selectional preferences, which models the
joint distribution of nouns n and verbs v by condi-
tioning them on a hidden class c. The probability of
a pair (v, n) then equals
P (v, n) =
?
c?C
P (c)P (v|c)P (n|c) (1)
Similarity-based method The next classifier we
use combines similarity between nouns with rank-
ing information and is a modification of the method
described in (Pado et al., 2007). First, for all words
ni on the ranking list their frequency scores are nor-
malised between 0 and 1, fi. Then, they are weighed
by the similarity score between a new noun nj and a
corresponding word on the ranking list, ni, and the
noun with the highest score (1-nearest neighbour) is
selected:
argmax
ni
fi ? sim(nj , ni) (2)
Finally, two highest scores for each verb?s ranking
list are compared and the verb with higher score is
selected as a preferred one.
In addition, if we sum over all seen words instead
of choosing the nearest neighbour, this will lead to
the original approach by Pado et al. (2007). In the
experimental part we consider both approaches (the
original method is referred to as SMP while the
nearest neighbour approach is marked by SMknn)
and study whether there is any difference between
the two when a verb that allows many different ar-
guments is considered (e.g., it may be better to use
the nearest neighbour approach for to do rather than
aggregating over all similarity scores).
Bag-of-words (BoW) approach This widely used
approach to document classification considers con-
textual words and their frequencies to represent doc-
uments (Zellig, 1954). We restrict the length of the
context around two verbs (within a window of ?2
and ?3 around the focus word, make or do) and
build a Naive Bayes classifier.
2.2 Data
Both verbs, to make and to do, license complements
of various kinds, e. g. they can be mono-transitive,
ditransitive, and complex transitive (sentences 1, 2,
and 3, respectively). Furthermore, make can be part
of idiomatic ditransitives (e.g., make use of, make
fun of, make room for) and phrasal mono-transitives
(e.g., make up) .
1. Andrew made [a cake]dobj .
2. Andrew made [his mum]iobj [a cake]dobj .
3. Andrew made [his mum]dobj happy.
For English, we use one of the largest cor-
pora available, the PukWAC (over 2 billion words,
30GB) (Baroni et al., 2009), which has been parsed
by MaltParser (Nivre and Scholz, 2004). We extract
all sentences with to do or to make (based on lem-
mata). The verb to make occurs in 2,13% of sen-
tences, and the verb to do in 3,27% of sentences in
the PukWAC corpus. Next, we exclude from con-
sideration phrasal mono-transitives and select sen-
tences where verb complements are nouns (Table 1).
For experiments in Dutch, we use the ?Wikipedia
Dump Of 2010? corpus, which is a part of Lassy
Large corpus (159 million tokens), and is parsed by

the Alpino parser (Bouma et al., 2001). Unlike in
English data, to make occurs here more often than
to do (3,3% vs. 1%). This difference can be ex-
plained by the fact that to do is also an auxiliary verb
in English which leads to more occurrences in to-
tal. Similarly to the English data set, phrasal mono-
transitives are filtered out. Finally, the sentences
that contain either to make or to do from wiki01 up
to wiki07 (19,847 sentences in total) have been se-
lected for training and wiki08 (1,769 sentences in
total) for testing. To be able to compare our results
against the performance on English data, we sample
a subset from PukWAC which is of the same size as
Dutch data set and is referred to as EN (sm).
To measure distributional similarity for the near-
est neighbour method, we use first-order and
second-order similarity based on Lin?s information
theoretic measure (Lin, 1998). For both languages,
similarity scores have been derived given a subset
of Wikipedia (276 million tokens for English and
114 million tokens for Dutch) using the DISCO
API (Kolb, 2009).
2.3 Results
Table 2 and Table 3 summarize our results. When re-
ferring to similarity-based methods, the symbols (f)
and (s) indicate first-order and second-order similar-
ity. For the BoW models, ?2 and ?3 corresponds
to the context length. The performance is measured
by true positive rate (TP) per class, overall accuracy
(Acc) and coverage (Cov). The former indicates in
how many cases the correct class label (make or do)
has been predicted, while the latter shows how many
examples a system was able to classify. Coverage is
especially indicative for LCS and semantic similar-
ity approaches because they may fail to yield pre-
dictions. For these methods, we provide two evalua-
tions. First, in order to be able to compare results
against the BoW approach, we measure accuracy
and coverage on all test examples. In such a case,
if some direct objects occur very often in the test set
and are classified correctly, accuracy scores will be
boosted. Therefore, we also provide the second eval-
uation where we measure accuracy and coverage on
(unique) test examples regardless of how frequent
they are. This evaluation will give us a better in-
sight into how well LCS and similarity-based meth-
ods work. Finally, we tested several settings for the
LSC method and the results presented here are ob-
tained for 20 clusters and 50 iterations. We remove
stop words 2 but do not take any other preprocessing
steps.
For both languages, it is more difficult to predict
to do than to make, although the differences in per-
formance on Dutch data (NL) are much smaller than
on English data (EN (sm)). An interesting obser-
vation is that using second-order similarity slightly
boosts performance for to make but is highly unde-
sirable for predicting to do (decrease in accuracy for
around 15%) in Dutch. This may be explained by the
fact that the objects of to do are already very generic.
Our findings on English data are that the similarity-
based approach is more sensitive to the choice of
aggregating over all words in the training set or se-
lecting the nearest neighbour. In particular, we ob-
tained better performance when choosing the nearest
neighbour for to do but aggregating over all scores
for to make. The results on Dutch and English data
are in general not always comparable. In addition
to the differences in performance of similarity-based
methods, the BoW models work better for predicting
to do in English but to make in Dutch.
As expected, similarity-based approaches yield
higher coverage than LSC, although the latter is su-
perior in terms of accuracy (in all cases but to do
in English). Since LSC turned out to be the most
computationally efficient method, we have also run
it on larger subsets of the PukWAC data set, up to
the entire corpus. We have not noticed any signifi-

cant changes in performance; the results for the en-
tire data set, EN (all), are given in the first row of
Table 2. Table 3 shows the results for the methods
using direct object information on unique objects,
which gives a more realistic assessment of their per-
formance. At closer inspection, we noticed that
many non-classified cases in Dutch refer to com-
pounds. For instance, bluegrassmuziek (bluegrass
music) cannot be compared against known words in
the training set. In order to cover such cases, existing
methods may benefit from morphological analysis.
3 Conclusions
In order to predict the use of two often confused
verbs, to make and to do, we have compared two
methods to modeling selectional preferences against
the bag-of-words approach. The BoW method is al-
ways outperformed by LCS and similarity-based ap-
proaches, although the differences in performance
are much larger for to do in Dutch and for to make
in English. In this study, we do not use any corpus of
non-native speakers? errors and explore how well it
is possible to predict one of two verbs provided that
the context words have been chosen correctly. In the
future work, we plan to label all incorrect uses of to
make and to do and to correct them.
