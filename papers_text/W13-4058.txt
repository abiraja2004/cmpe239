Abstract
We present a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) envi-
ronment that was designed to build an arti-
ficial embodied intelligent tutoring system
(ITS) that is capable of empathic conver-
sations with school pupils aged between
10-13. We describe the components and
the data that we plan to collect using the
environment.
1 Introduction
We present a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) environment
that was built as a part of the EC FP7 EMOTE
project1. The objective of this work is to col-
lect multimodal interaction data to build an arti-
ficial embodied intelligent tutoring system (ITS)
that is capable of empathic conversations with
school pupils aged between 10-13. Specifically,
the EMOTE (EMbOdied-perceptive Tutors for
Empathy-based learning) project aims to design
and evaluate a new generation of robotic tutors
that have perceptive and expressive capabilities
to engage in empathic interactions with learners
in schools and home environments. The project
will carry out interdisciplinary research on affect
recognition, learner models, adaptive behaviour
and embodiment for human-robot interaction in
learning environments, grounded in psychologi-
cal theories of emotion in social interaction and
pedagogical models for learning facilitation. An
overview of the project can be found in (Desh-
mukh et al, 2013).
Wizard of Oz is an effective technique in Hu-
man Computer Interaction (HCI) studies where
an interactive agent, which is not yet fully au-
tonomous, is remotely controlled by a human wiz-
1http://emote-project.eu/
ard. However the participants who are interacting
with the agent are not told that the agent is being
remotely controlled. The wizard may be tasked
to control one or many parts of the agent such
as speech recognition and understanding, affect
recognition, dialogue management, utterance and
gesture generation and so on. Studies have shown
that users ?go easy? on computers during inter-
action and therefore interaction with ?wizarded?
system are at the level of complexity that can be
learned and emulated (Pearson et al, 2006).
The WoZ environment presented in this paper
will be used to collect data to inform the algo-
rithms for affect recognition and empathic dia-
logue management. The WoZ environment is de-
signed to collect data on how human tutors aided
with a robotic interface adapt to learners? emotions
and cognitive states in tutorial tasks. In this study,
the wizard plays the same role as that of affect
recognition and dialogue management modules in
the actual final system.
2 Previous work
Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) frameworks have been used
in several studies since (Fraser and Gilbert, 1991)
in order to collect human-computer dialogue data
to help design dialogue systems. WoZ systems
have been used to collect data to learn (e.g.
(Strauss et al, 2007)) and evaluate dialogue man-
agement policies (e.g. (Cuaya?huitl and Kruijff-
Korbayova, 2012)).
3 The EMOTE Wizard of Oz
environment
The WoZ environment consists of the wizard?s
desk, the interactive touch table, sensors, and the
robotic embodiment as shown in Figure 1. The
363
wizard will be seated in a different room away
from the learner.

3.1 Wizard?s desk
The wizard?s desk consists of two display screens.
The touch table display at the user end will be mir-
rored on to one of the displays at the wizard?s desk
using which the wizard can observe the learner?s
activities related to the educational application.
Another display will contain the Wizard Interface,
a software application that allows the wizard to in-
teract with the learner (see Figure 2). The Wiz-
ard Interface consists of four panels: task control,
information, learner response and operations. In
the task control panel, the wizard will be
able to choose a task plan for the learner and ac-
cess the tool and curriculum scripts (XML file).
The tool script contains information on how to use
the tools that are at the disposal of the learner. For
instance, to create a marker on the map, one has
to click on the appropriate tool and click on the
map and so on. The curriculum script contains
information on the skills that the learner needs
to exercise or develop during his interaction with
the system. For instance, in order to identify the
right direction, the system will present the mneu-
monic phrase ?Naughty Elephants Squirt Water?
in various forms such as a hint, question, pump-
ing move, etc. to provide support to the learner.
The information panel contains the video
feed from two cameras (see Section 3.4). This
will allow the wizard to determine the affective
state of the learner. The learner?s response to the
agent?s utterances (such as answering questions in
the curriculum scripts) will also be displayed in
the learner response panel. Finally, the
operations panel provides options for the
Wizard to respond to the learner based on the tools
and curriculum scripts. These responses are ei-
ther customised or predefined. The customised
responses facilitate the wizard to execute robot
movements on lower level (individual head, arm
movements) and predefined responses contain a
list for combined predefined speech, sound and be-
haviours.

3.2 Touch table
The interactive touch table is a 55 inch Multitac-
tion table capable of sensing multiple touch events
simultaneously. The educational application is
displayed on the table surface. A map based appli-
cation has been developed to teach learners basic
and advanced map reading skills (see Figure 3).
The touch interface allows the learner to use touch
to click, drag and zoom the map. The application
has two panels of GUI objects such as buttons and
text boxes namely, the tools panel and the interac-
tion panel. The tools panel consists of tools that
the learner can use to manipulate the map, while
using the interaction panel the learner can interact
with the tutor. Some of the tools that are currently
available are to get grid references for a position
on the map, dropping markers on the map, change
map types, etc. For instance, if the tutor asks a
yes/no question, the learner can respond by press-
ing the yes or the no button. The learner can an-
swer the tutor?s questions by typing into the text
box in the interaction panel.

3.3 Robotic embodiment
The robotic embodiment is a Nao robot (torso ver-
sion) that sits on the side of the touch table. It is
capable of head, arm and body gestures in addi-
tion to synthesised speech. The robot receives the
text and gestures selected by the wizard through
the Wizard Interface. Tutor?s utterances will be
synthesized into speech using the in-built text to
speech (TTS) engine while the gestures are re-
alised using appropriate head, arm and body mo-
tions. To increase naturalness, the robot will also
have idle movement in-between wizard selections.
3.4 Sensors
The environment has an array of sensors such as
two video cameras and a Kinect sensor. A Kinect
sensor and a video camera are placed in front the
learner. Another camera is placed in front of the
robot (as shown in Figure 1).
4 Data collection
In this section, we discuss the data that we aim
to collect using the WoZ environment. We intend
to collect these data during experiments where hu-
man tutors play the wizard?s role and the learners
from in the 10-13 year age-range will play the role
of learners. The task for the learner is to carry
out an expedition using the map application that
he or she is provided with. In order to solve the
steps of the expedition, the learner will have to
exercise his/her map reading skills. Map reading
skills such as compass directions, contour lines,
grid lines, etc. will have to be exercised using
appropriate map tools provided in the application.
The tutor?s role is to observe the learner responses
(both verbal and physical) and respond to them ap-
propriately using the interaction panel in the Wiz-
ard Interface application.
Simultaneous video feeds from two cameras
and the Kinect sensor will be recorded during the
tutor-learner interaction. These data will be fur-
ther used for affect recognition tasks based on
learner?s head, arm and body gestures. The inter-
action between the tutor and the learner in terms
of tutor dialogue actions, utterances and learner
responses in terms of button presses will also be
logged.
5 Demo
We propose to demonstrate the WoZ environment
set up using two laptops: learner desktop with the
map application and another with the wizard?s in-
terface. The learner desktop will also display a
simulated Nao robot. We will also exhibit the logs
that we collect from the pilot studies with a Geogr-
phy teacher acting as the wizard tutor and school
pupils as tutees.
