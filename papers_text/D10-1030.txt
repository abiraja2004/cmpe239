Abstract
We show that jointly performing semantic role
labeling (SRL) on bitext can improve SRL
results on both sides. In our approach, we
use monolingual SRL systems to produce ar-
gument candidates for predicates in bitext at
first. Then, we simultaneously generate SRL
results for two sides of bitext using our joint
inference model. Our model prefers the bilin-
gual SRL result that is not only reasonable on
each side of bitext, but also has more consis-
tent argument structures between two sides.
To evaluate the consistency between two argu-
ment structures, we also formulate a log-linear
model to compute the probability of aligning
two arguments. We have experimented with
our model on Chinese-English parallel Prop-
Bank data. Using our joint inference model,
F1 scores of SRL results on Chinese and En-
glish text achieve 79.53% and 77.87% respec-
tively, which are 1.52 and 1.74 points higher
than the results of baseline monolingual SRL
combination systems respectively.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increasing inter-
est in SRL on several languages. However, little
research has been done on how to effectively per-
form SRL on bitext, which has important applica-
tions including machine translation (Wu and Fung,
2009). A conventional way to perform SRL on bi-
text is performing SRL on each side of bitext sep-
arately, as has been done by Fung et al (2007) on
Chinese-English bitext. However, it is very difficult
to obtain good SRL results on both sides of bitext
in this way. The reason is that even the state-of-
the-art SRL systems do not have very high accuracy
on both English text (Ma`rquez et al, 2008; Pradhan
et al, 2008; Punyakanok et al, 2008; Toutanova et
al., 2008), and Chinese text (Che et al, 2008; Xue,
2008; Li et al, 2009; Sun et al, 2009).
On the other hand, the semantic equivalence be-
tween two sides of bitext means that they should
have consistent predicate-argument structures. This
bilingual argument structure consistency can guide
us to find better SRL results. For example, in Fig-
ure 1(a), the argument structure consistency can
guide us to choose a correct SRL result on Chinese
side. Consistency between two argument structures
is reflected by sound argument alignments between
them, as shown in Figure 1(b). Previous research has
shown that bilingual constraints can be very help-
ful for parsing (Burkett and Klein, 2008; Huang et
al., 2008). In this paper, we show that the bilingual
argument structure consistency can be leveraged to
substantially improve SRL results on both sides of
bitext.
Formally, we present a joint inference model to
preform bilingual SRL. Using automatic word align-
ment on bitext, we first identify a pair of predicates
that align with each other. And we use monolin-
gual SRL systems to produce argument candidates
for each predicate. Then, our model jointly generate
SRL results for both predicates from their argument
candidates, using integer linear programming (ILP)
technique. An overview of our approach is shown in
Figure 2.
Our joint inference model consists of three com-
ponents: the source side, the target side, and the ar-

Figure 1: An example from Chinese-English parallel PropBank. In (a), the SRL results are generated by the state-
of-the-art monolingual SRL systems. The English SRL result is correct. But it is to more difficult to get correct
SRL result on Chinese side, because the AM-TMP argument embeds into a discontinuous A1 argument. The Chinese
SRL result in the row marked by ?R1? is correct and consistent with the result on English side. Whereas the result in
the row marked by ?R2? is incorrect and inconsistent with the result on English side, with the circles showing their
inconsistency. The argument structure consistency can guide us to choose the correct Chinese SRL result.

gument alignment between two sides. These three
components correspond to three interrelated factors:
the quality of the SRL result on source side, the qual-
ity of the SRL result on target side, and the argu-
ment structure consistency between the SRL results
on both sides. To evaluate the consistency between
the two argument structures in our joint inference
model, we formulate a log-linear model to compute
the probability of aligning two arguments. Experi-
ments on Chinese-English parallel PropBank shows
that our model significantly outperforms monolin-
gual SRL combination systems on both Chinese and
English sides.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 introduces related work. Section 3 describes
how we generate SRL candidates on each side of bi-
text. Section 4 presents our joint inference model.
Section 5 presents our experiments. And Section 6
concludes our work.
2 Related Work
Some existing work on monolingual SRL combina-
tion is related to our work. Punyakanok et al (2004;
2008) formulated an ILP model for SRL. Koomen
et al (2005) combined several SRL outputs using
ILP method. Ma`rquez et al (2005) and Pradhan et
al. (2005) proposed combination strategies that are
not based on ILP method. Surdeanu et al (2007)
did a complete research on a variety of combination
strategies. Zhuang and Zong (2010) proposed a min-
imum error weighting combination strategy for Chi-
nese SRL combination.
Research on SRL utilizing parallel corpus is also
related to our work. Pado? and Lapata (2009) did
research on cross-lingual annotation projection on
English-German parallel corpus. They performed
SRL only on the English side, and then mapped
the English SRL result to German side. Fung et
al. (2007) did pioneering work on studying argu-
ment alignment on Chinese-English parallel Prop-
Bank. They performed SRL on Chinese and En-
glish sides separately. Then, given the SRL result
on both sides, they automatically induced the argu-
ment alignment between two sides.
The major difference between our work and all
existing research is that our model performs SRL in-
ference on two sides of bitext simultaneously. In our
305
model, we jointly consider three interrelated factors:
SRL result on the source side, SRL result on the tar-
get side, and the argument alignment between them.
3 Generating Candidates for Inference
3.1 Monolingual SRL System
As shown in Figure 2, we need to use a monolin-
gual SRL system to generate candidates for our joint
inference model. We have implemented a monolin-
gual SRL system which utilize full phrase-structure
parse trees to perform SRL. In this system, the whole
SRL process is comprised of three stages: pruning,
argument identification, and argument classification.
In the pruning stage, the heuristic pruning method
in (Xue, 2008) is employed. In the argument iden-
tification stage, a number of argument locations are
identified in a sentence. In the argument classifica-
tion stage, each location identified in the previous
stage is assigned a semantic role label. Maximum
entropy classifier is employed for both the argument
identification and classification tasks. And Zhang
Le?s MaxEnt toolkit1 is used for implementation.
We use the monolingual SRL system described
above for both Chinese and English SRL tasks. For
the Chinese SRL task, the features used in this paper
are the same with those used in (Xue, 2008). For
the English SRL task, the features used are the same
with those used in (Pradhan et al, 2008).
3.2 Output of the Monolingual SRL System
The maximum entropy classifier in our monolingual
SRL system can output classification probabilities.
We use the classification probability of the argument
classification stage as an argument?s probability. As
illustrated in Figure 3, in an individual system?s out-
put, each argument has three attributes: its location
in sentence loc, represented by the number of its first
word and last word; its semantic role label l; and its
probability p.
So each argument outputted by a system is a triple
(loc, l, p). For example, the A0 argument in Figure 3
is ((0, 2),A0, 0.94). Because these outputs are to be
combined, we call such triple a candidate.

Figure 3: Three attributes of an output argument: location
loc, label l, and probability p.
3.3 Generating and Merging Candidates
To generate candidates for joint inference, we need
to have multiple SRL results on each side of bi-
text. Therefore, for both Chinese and English SRL
systems, we use the 3-best parse trees of Berkeley
parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and 1-best parse
trees of Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Stanford
parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) as inputs. All the
three parsers are multilingual parsers. The second
and third best parse trees of Berkeley parser are used
for their good quality. Therefore, each monolingual
SRL system produces 5 different outputs.
Candidates from different outputs may have the
same loc and l but different p. So we merge all
candidates with the same loc and l into one by av-
eraging their probabilities. For a merged candidate
(loc, l, p), we say that p is the probability of assign-
ing l to loc.
4 Joint Inference Model
Our model can be conceptually decomposed to three
components: the source side, the target side, and the
argument alignment. The objective function of our
joint inference model is the weighted sum of three
sub-objectives:
max Os + ?1Ot + ?2Oa (1)
where Os and Ot represent the quality of the SRL
results on source and target sides, and Oa represents
the soundness of the argument alignment between
the SRL results on two sides, ?1, ?2 are positive
weights corresponding to the importance of Ot and
Oa respectively.
4.1 Components of Source and Target Sides
4.1.1 Source Side Component
The source side component aims to improve the
SRL result on source side. This is equivalent to a
306
monolingual SRL combination problem.
For convenience, we denote the whole semantic
role label set for source language as {ls1, l
s
2, . . . , l
s
Ls},
in which ls1 ? l
s
6 stand for the key argument labels
A0 ? A5 respectively. Suppose there are Ns differ-
ent locations, denoted as locs1, . . . , loc
s
Ns , among all
candidates on the source side. The probability of as-
signing lsj to loc
s
i is p
s
ij . An indicator variable xij is
defined as:
xij = [loc
s
i is assigned label l
s
j ].
Then the source side sub-objective Os in equation
(1) is the sum of arguments? probabilities on source
side:
Os =
Ns?
i=1
Ls?
j=1
(psij ? Ts)xij (2)
where Ts is a bias to prevent including too many can-
didates in solution (Surdeanu et al, 2007).
We consider the following two linguistically mo-
tivated constraints:
1. No duplication: There is no duplication for key
arguments: A0 ? A5.
2. No overlapping: Arguments cannot overlap
with each other.
In (Punyakanok et al, 2004), several more con-
straints are considered. According to (Surdeanu
et al, 2007), however, no significant performance
improvement can be obtained by considering more
constraints than the two above. So we do not con-
sider other constraints.
The inequalities in (3) make sure that each locsi is
assigned at most one label.
?1 ? i ? Ns :
Ls?
j=1
xij ? 1 (3)
The inequalities in (4) satisfy the No duplication
constraint.
?1 ? j ? 6 :
Ns?
i=1
xij ? 1 (4)
For any source side location locsi , let Ci denote
the index set of the locations that overlap with it.
Then the No overlapping constraint means that if
locsi is assigned a label, i.e.,
?Ns
j=1 xij = 1, then
for any u ? Ci, locsu cannot be assigned any label,
i.e.,
?Ns
j=1 xuj = 0. A common technique in ILP
modeling to form such a constraint is to use a suf-
ficiently large auxiliary constant M . And the con-
straint is formulated as:
?1 ? i ? Ns :
?
u?Ci
Ls?
j=1
xuj ? (1?
Ls?
j=1
xij)M (5)
In this case,M only needs to be larger than the num-
ber of candidates to be combined. In this paper,
M = 500 is large enough.
4.1.2 Target Side Component
In principle, the target side component of our joint
inference model is the same with the source side
component.
The whole semantic role label set for target lan-
guage is denoted by {lt1, l
t
2, . . . , l
t
Lt}. There are
Nt different locations, denoted as loct1, . . . , loc
t
Nt ,
among all candidates in the target side. And lt1 ? l
t
6
stand for the key argument labels A0 ? A5 respec-
tively. The probability of assigning ltj to loc
t
k is p
t
kj .
An indicator variable ykj is defined as:
ykj = [loc
t
k is assigned label l
t
j ].
Then the target side sub-objective Ot in equation (1)
is:
Ot =
Nt?
k=1
Lt?
j=1
(ptkj ? Tt)ykj (6)
The constraints on target side are as follows:
Each loctk is assigned at most one label:
?1 ? k ? Nt :
Lt?
j=1
ykj ? 1 (7)
The No duplication constraint:
?1 ? j ? 6 :
Nt?
k=1
ykj ? 1 (8)
The No overlapping constraint:
?1 ? k ? Nt :
?
v?Ck
Lt?
j=1
yvj ? (1?
Lt?
j=1
ykj)M (9)
In (9), Ck denotes the index set of the locations that
overlap with loctk, and the constant M is set to 500
in this paper.

4.2 Argument Alignment
The argument alignment component is the core of
our joint inference model. It gives preference to the
bilingual SRL results that have more consistent ar-
gument structures.
For a source side argument argsi = (loc
s
i , l
s) and
a target side argument argtk = (loc
t
k, l
t), let zik be
the following indicator variable:
zik = [arg
s
i aligns with arg
t
k].
We use paik to represent the probability that arg
s
i and
argtk align with each other, i.e., p
a
ik = P (zik = 1).
We call paik the argument alignment probability
between argsi and arg
t
k.
4.2.1 Argument Alignment Probability Model
We use a log-linear model to compute the argu-
ment alignment probability paik between arg
s
i and
argtk. Let (s, t) denote a bilingual sentence pair and
wa denote the word alignment on (s, t). Our log-
linear model defines a distribution on zik given the
tuple tup = (argsi , arg
t
k, wa, s, t):
P (zik|tup) ? exp(w
T?(tup))
where ?(tup) is the feature vector. With this model,
paik can be computed as p
a
ik = P (zik = 1|tup).
In order to study the argument alignment in cor-
pus and to provide training data for our log-linear
model, we have manually aligned the arguments in
60 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0180.fid) of Chinese-
English parallel PropBank. On this data set, we get
the argument alignment matrix in Table 1.
Ch\En A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 AM* NUL
A0 492 30 4 0 0 0 46
A1 98 853 43 2 0 0 8
A2 9 57 51 1 0 47 0
A3 1 0 2 6 0 0 0
A4 0 0 2 0 3 0 0
AM* 0 2 39 0 0 895 221
NUL 53 14 27 0 0 45 0
Table 1: The argument alignment matrix on manually
aligned corpus.
Each entry in Table 1 is the number of times for
which one type of Chinese argument aligns with one
type of English argument. AM* stands for all ad-
juncts types like AM-TMP, AM-LOC, etc., and NUL
means that the argument on the other side cannot be
aligned with any argument on this side. For exam-
ple, the number 46 in the A0 row and NUL column
means that Chinese A0 argument cannot be aligned
with any argument on English side for 46 times in
our manually aligned corpus.
We use the following features in our model.
Word alignment feature: If there are many word-
to-word alignments between argsi and arg
t
k, then
it is very probable that argsi and arg
t
k would align
with each other. We adopt the method used in (Pado?
and Lapata, 2009) to measure the word-to-word
alignments between argsi and arg
t
k. And the word
alignment feature is defined as same as the word
alignment-based word overlap in (Pado? and Lapata,
2009). Note that this is a real-valued feature.
Head word alignment feature: The head word
of an argument is usually more representative than
other words. So we use whether the head words of
argsi and arg
t
k align with each other as a binary fea-
ture. The use of this feature is inspired by the work
in (Burkett and Klein, 2008).
Semantic role labels of two arguments: From Ta-
ble 1, we can see that semantic role labels of two ar-
guments are a good indicator of whether they should
align with each other. For example, a Chinese A0
argument aligns with an English A0 argument most
of the times, and never aligns with an English AM*
argument in Table 1. Therefore, the semantic role
labels of argsi and arg
t
k are used as a feature.
Predicate verb pair: Different predicate pairs have
different argument alignment patterns. Let?s take the
Chinese predicate O/zengzhang and the English
predicate grow as an example. The argument align-
ment matrix for all instances of the Chinese-English
predicate pair (zengzhang, grow) in our manually
aligned corpus is shown in Table 2.
CH \EN A0 A1 A2 AM* NUL
A0 0 16 0 0 0
A1 0 0 12 0 0
AM* 0 0 4 7 10
NUL 0 0 0 2 0
Table 2: The argument alignment matrix for the predicate
pair (zengzhang, grow).
From Table 2 we can see that all A0 arguments of
zengzhang align with A1 arguments of grow. This
308
is very different from the results in Table 1, where a
Chinese A0 argument tends to align with an English
A0 argument. This phenomenon shows that a pred-
icate pair can determine which types of arguments
should align with each other. Therefore, we use the
predicate pair as a feature.
4.2.2 Argument Alignment Component
The argument alignment sub-objective Oa in
equation (1) is the sum of argument alignment prob-
abilities:
Oa =
Ns?
i=1
Nt?
k=1
(paik ? Ta)zik (10)
where Ta is a bias to prevent including too many
alignments in final solution, and paik is computed
using the log-linear model described in subsec-
tion 4.2.1.
Oa reflects the consistency between argument
structures on two sides of bitext. Larger Oa means
better argument alignment between two sides, thus
indicates more consistency between argument struc-
tures on two sides.
The following constraints are considered:
1. Conformity with bilingual SRL result. For
all candidates on both source and target sides, only
those that are chosen to be arguments on each side
can be aligned.
2. One-to-many alignment limit. Each argument
can not be aligned with more than 3 arguments.
3. Complete argument alignment. Each argument
on source side must be aligned with at least one ar-
gument on target side, and vice versa.
The Conformity with bilingual SRL result con-
straint is necessary to validly integrate the bilingual
SRL result with the argument alignment. This con-
straint means that if argsi and arg
t
k align with each
other, i.e., zik = 1, then locsi must be assigned
a label on source side, i.e.,
?Ls
j=1 xij = 1, and
loctk must be assigned a label on target side, i.e.,?Lt
j=1 ykj = 1. So this constraint can be represented
as:
?1 ? i ? Ns, 1 ? k ? Nt :
Ls?
j=1
xij ? zik (11)
?1 ? k ? Nt, 1 ? i ? Ns :
Lt?
j=1
ykj ? zik (12)
The One-to-many alignment limit constraint
comes from our observation on manually aligned
corpus. We have found that no argument aligns with
more than 3 arguments in our manually aligned cor-
pus. This constraint can be represented as:
?1 ? i ? Ns :
Nt?
k=1
zik ? 3 (13)
?1 ? k ? Nt :
Ns?
i=1
zik ? 3 (14)
The Complete argument alignment constraint
comes from the semantic equivalence between two
sides of bitext. For each source side location locsi ,
if it is assigned a label, i.e.,
?Ls
j=1 xij = 1, then it
must be aligned with some arguments on target side,
i.e.,
?Nt
k=1 zik ? 1. This can be represented as:
?1 ? i ? Ns :
Nt?
k=1
zik ?
Ls?
j=1
xij (15)
Similarly, each target side argument must be aligned
to at least one source side argument. This can be
represented as:
?1 ? k ? Nt :
Ns?
i=1
zik ?
Lt?
j=1
ykj (16)
4.3 Complete Argument Alignment as a Soft
Constraint
Although the hard Complement argument alignment
constraint is ideally reasonable, in real situations this
constraint does not always hold. The manual argu-
ment alignment result shown in Table 1 indicates
that in some cases an argument cannot be aligned
with any argument on the other side (see the NUL
row and column in Table 1). Therefore, it would
be reasonable to change the hard Complement argu-
ment alignment constraint to a soft one. To do so,
we need to remove the hard Complement argument
alignment constraint and add penalty for violation of
this constraint.
If an argument does not align with any argument
on the other side, we say it aligns with NUL. And we
define the following indicator variables:
zi,NUL = [argsi aligns with NUL], 1 ? i ? Ns.
309
zNUL,k = [argtk aligns with NUL], 1 ? k ? Nt.
Then
?Ns
i=1 zi,NUL is the number of source side ar-
guments that align with NUL. And
?Nt
k=1 zNUL,k is
the number of target side arguments that align with
NUL. For each argument that aligns with NUL, we
add a penalty ?3 to the argument alignment sub-
objective Oa. Therefore, the sub-objective Oa in
equation (10) is changed to:
Oa =
Ns?
i=1
Nt?
k=1
(paik ? Ta)zik
??3(
Ns?
i=1
zi,NUL +
Nt?
k=1
zNUL,k) (17)
From the definition of zi,NUL, it is obvious that,
for any 1 ? i ? Ns, zi,NUL and zik(1 ? k ? Nt)
have the following relationship: If
?Nt
k=1 zik ? 1,
i.e., argsi aligns with some arguments on target side,
then zi,NUL = 0; Otherwise, zi,NUL = 1. These
relationships can be captured by the following con-
straints:
?1 ? i ? Ns, 1 ? k ? Nt : zi,NUL ? 1?zik (18)
?1 ? i ? Ns :
Nt?
k=1
zik + zi,NUL ? 1 (19)
Similarly, for any 1 ? k ? Nt, zNUL,k and
zik(1 ? i ? Ns) observe the following constraints:
?1 ? k ? Nt, 1 ? i ? Ns : zNUL,k ? 1? zik
(20)
?1 ? k ? Nt :
Ns?
i=1
zik + zNUL,k ? 1 (21)
4.4 Models Summary
So far, we have presented two versions of our joint
inference model. The first version treats Comple-
ment argument alignment as a hard constraint. We
will refer to this version as Joint1. The objective
function of Joint1 is defined by equations (1, 2, 6,
10). And the constraints of Joint1 are defined by
equations (3-5, 7-9, 11-16).
The sencond version treats Complement argument
alignment as a soft constraint. We will refer to this
version as Joint2. The objective function of Joint2
is defined by equations (1, 2, 6, 17). And the con-
straints of Joint2 are defined by equations (3-5, 7-9,
11-14, 18-21).
Our baseline models are monolingual SRL com-
bination models. We will refer to the source side
combination model as SrcCmb. The objective of Sr-
cCmb is to maximize Os, which is defined in equa-
tion (2). And the constraints of SrcCmb are defined
by equations (3-5). Similarly, we will refer to the tar-
get side combination model as TrgCmb. The objec-
tive of TrgCmb is to maximize Ot defined in equa-
tion (6). And the constraints of TrgCmb are defined
by equations (7-9). In this paper, we employ lp-
solve2 to solve all ILP models.

Release 3.0. This data is a Chinese-English parallel
proposition bank described in (Palmer et al, 2005).
It contains parallel proposition annotations for 325
files (chtb 0001.fid to chtb 0325.fid) from Chinese-
English parallel Treebank. The English part of this
data contains proposition annotations only for ver-
bal predicates. Therefore, we only consider verbal
predicates in this paper.
We employ the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney,
2003) to perform automatic word alignment. Be-
sides the parallel PropBank data, we use additional
4,500K Chinese-English sentence pairs3 to induce
word alignments for both directions, with the default
GIZA++ settings. The alignments are symmetrized
using the intersection heuristic (Och and Ney, 2003),
which is known to produce high-precision align-
ments.
We use 80 files (chtb 0001.fid to chtb 0080.fid)
as test data, and 40 files (chtb 0081.fid to
chtb 0120.fid) as development data. Although our
joint inference model needs no training, we still
need to train a log-linear argument alignment prob-
ability model, which is used in the joint inference
model. As specified in subsection 4.2.1, the train-

LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, LDC2005T06,
LDC2004T07, LDC2000T50.

ing set for the argument alignment probability model
consists of 60 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0180.fid)
with manual argument alignment. Unfortunately,
the quality of automatic word alignment on one-
to-many Chinese-English sentence pairs is usually
very poor. So we only include one-to-one Chinese-
English sentence pairs in all data. And not all predi-
cates in a sentence pair can be included. Only bilin-
gual predicate pairs are included. A bilingual pred-
icate pair is defined to be a pair of predicates in bi-
text which align with each other in automatic word
alignment. Table 3 shows how many sentences and
predicates are included in each data set.

Our monolingual SRL systems are trained sep-
arately. Our Chinese SRL system is trained on
640 files (chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0931.fid) in Chinese
Propbank 1.0. Because Xinhua News is a quite dif-
ferent domain from WSJ, the training set for our En-
glish SRL system includes not only Sections 02?21
of WSJ data in English Propbank, but also 205 files
(chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0325.fid) in the English part
of parallel PropBank. For Chinese, the syntactic
parsers are trained on 640 files (chtb 0121.fid to
chtb 0931.fid) plus the broadcast news portion of
Chinese Treebank 6.0. For English, the syntactic
parsers are trained on the following data: Sections
02?21 of WSJ data in English Treebank, 205 files
(chtb 0121.fid to chtb 0325.fid) of Xinhua News
data in OntoNotes 3.0, and the Sinorama data in
OntoNotes 3.0. We treat discontinuous and corefer-
ential arguments in accordance to the CoNLL-2005
shared task (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005). The first
part of a discontinuous argument is labeled as it is,
and the second part is labeled with a prefix ?C-?.
All coreferential arguments are labeled with a prefix
?R-?.
5.2 Tuning Parameters in Models
The models Joint1, Joint2, SrcCmb, and TrgCmb
have different parameters. For each model, we have
automatically tuned its parameters on development
set using Powell?s Mothod (Brent, 1973). Powell?s
Method is a heuristic optimization algorithm that
does not require the objective function to have an ex-
plicit analytical formula. For a monolingual model
like SrcCmb or TrgCmb, our objective is to maxi-
mize the F1 score of the model?s result on develop-
ment set. But a joint model, like Joint1 or Joint2,
generates SRL results on both sides of bitext. So
our objective is to maximize the sum of the two F1
scores of the model?s results for both Chinese and
English on development set. For all models, we re-
gard the parameters to be tuned as variables. Then
we optimize our objective using Powell?s Method.
The solution of this optimization is the values of pa-
rameters. To avoid finding poor local optimum, we
perform the optimization 30 times with different ini-
tial parameter values, and choose the best solution
found. The final parameter values are listed in Ta-
ble 4.

Table 4: Parameter values in models.
5.3 Individual SRL Outputs? Performance
As specified in subsection 3.3, the monoligual SRL
system uses different parse trees to generate multi-
ple SRL outputs. The performance of these outputs
on test set is shown in Table 5. In Table 5, O1?O3
are the outputs using 3-best parse trees of Berkeley
parser respectively, O4 and O5 are the outputs us-
ing the best parse trees of Stanford parser and Bikel
parser respectively.
As specified in subsection 5.1, only a small part
of English SRL training data is in the same domain
with test data. Therefore, the English SRL result in
Table 5 is not very impressive. But the Chinese SRL
result is pretty good.

5.4 Effects of Different Constraints
The One-to-many limit and Complete argument
alignment constraints in subsection 4.2.2 comes
from our empirical knowledge. To investigate the
effect of these two constraits, we remove them from
our joint inference models one by one, and observe
the performance variations on test set. The results
are shown in Table 6. In Table 6, ?c2? refers to the
One-to-many limit constraint, ?c3? refers to the Com-
plete argument alignment constraint, and ?-? means
removing. For example, ?Joint1 - c2? means remov-
ing the constraint ?c2? from the model Joint1. Recall
that the only difference between Joint1 and Joint2 is
that ?c3? is a hard constraint in Joint1, but a soft con-
straint in Joint2. Therefore, ?Joint2 - c3? and ?Joint2
- c2 - c3? do not appear in Table 6, because they are
the same with ?Joint1 - c3? and ?Joint1 - c2 - c3?
respectively.

Joint2 79.64 76.18 77.87
Joint2 - c2 78.41 75.89 77.13
Table 6: Results of different joint models on test set.
From Table 6, we can see that the constraints ?c2?
and ?c3? both have positive effect in our joint in-
ference model, because removing any one of them
causes performance degradation. And removing
?c3? from Joint1 causes more performance degrada-
tion than removing ?c2?. This means that ?c3? plays
a more important role than ?c2? in our joint inference
model. Indeed, by treating ?c3? as a soft constraint,
the model Joint2 has the best performance on both
sides of bitext.
5.5 Final Results
We use Joint2 as our final joint inference model.
And as specified in subsection 4.4, our baselines are
monolingual SRL combination models: SrcCmb for
Chinese, and TrgCmb for English. Note that SrcCmb
and TrgCmb are basically the same as the state-of-
the-art combination model in (Surdeanu et al, 2007)
with No overlapping and No duplication constraints.
The final results on test set are shown in Table 7.

Joint2 79.64 76.18 77.87
Table 7: Comparison between monolingual combination
model and our joint inference model on test set.
From Table 5 and Table 7, we can see that SrcCmb
and TrgCmb improve F1 scores over the best indi-
vidual SRL outputs by 2.32 points and 2.51 points
on Chinese and English seperately. Thus they form
strong baselines for our joint inference model. Even
so, our joint inference model still improves F1 score
over SrcCmb by 1.52 points, and over TrgCmb by
1.74 points.
From Table 7, we can see that, despite only part of
training data for English SRL system is in-domain,
our joint inference model still produces good En-
glish SRL result. And the F1 score of Chinese SRL
result reaches 79.53%, which represents the state-
of-the-art Chinese SRL performance to date.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a joint inference model
to perform bilingual SRL. Our joint inference
model incorporates not only linguistic constraints on
312
source and target sides of bitext, but also the bilin-
gual argument structure consistency requirement on
bitext. Experiments on Chinese-English parallel
PropBank show that our joint inference model is
very effective for bilingual SRL. Compared to state-
of-the-art monolingual SRL combination baselines,
our joint inference model substantially improves
SRL results on both sides of bitext. In fact, the so-
lution of our joint inference model contains not only
the SRL results on bitext, but also the optimal argu-
ment alignment between two sides of bitext. This
makes our model especially suitable for application
in machine translation, which needs to obtain the ar-
gument alignment.
