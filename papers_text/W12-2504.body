Abstract
The identification of stylistic inconsistency is a
challenging task relevant to a number of gen-
res, including literature. In this work, we
carry out stylistic segmentation of a well-known
poem, The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, which
is traditionally analyzed in terms of numerous
voices which appear throughout the text. Our
method, adapted from work in topic segmen-
tation and plagiarism detection, predicts breaks
based on a curve of stylistic change which com-
bines information from a diverse set of features,
most notably co-occurrence in larger corpora via
reduced-dimensionality vectors. We show that
this extrinsic information is more useful than
(within-text) distributional features. We achieve
well above baseline performance on both artifi-
cial mixed-style texts and The Waste Land itself.
1 Introduction
Most work in automated stylistic analysis operates
at the level of a text, assuming that a text is stylis-
tically homogeneous. However, there are a number
of instances where that assumption is unwarranted.
One example is documents collaboratively created
by multiple authors, in which contributors may, ei-
ther inadvertently or deliberately (e.g. Wikipedia
vandalism), create text which fails to form a stylis-
tically coherent whole. Similarly, stylistic incon-
sistency might also arise when one of the ?contrib-
utors? is actually not one of the purported authors
of the work at all ? that is, in cases of plagia-
rism. More-deliberate forms of stylistic dissonance
include satire, which may first follow and then flout
the stylistic norms of a genre, and much narrative lit-
erature, in which the author may give the speech or
thought patterns of a particular character their own
style distinct from that of the narrator. In this paper,
we address this last source of heterogeneity in the
context of the well-known poem The Waste Land by
T.S. Eliot, which is often analyzed in terms of the
distinct voices that appear throughout the text.
T.S. Eliot (1888?1965), recipient of the 1948 No-
bel Prize for Literature, is among the most important
twentieth-century writers in the English language.
Though he worked in a variety of forms ? he was
a celebrated critic as well as a dramatist, receiving
a Tony Award in 1950 ? he is best remembered to-
day for his poems, of which The Waste Land (1922)
is among the most famous. The poem deals with
themes of spiritual death and rebirth. It is notable
for its disjunctive structure, its syncopated rhythms,
its wide range of literary allusions, and its incorpo-
ration of numerous other languages. The poem is di-
vided into five parts; in total it is 433 lines long, and
contains 3533 tokens, not including the headings.
A prominent debate among scholars of The Waste
Land concerns whether a single speaker?s voice pre-
dominates in the poem (Bedient, 1986), or whether
the poem should be regarded instead as dramatic
or operatic in structure, composed of about twelve
different voices independent of a single speaker
(Cooper, 1987). Eliot himself, in his notes to The
Waste Land, supports the latter view by referring to
?characters? and ?personage[s]? in the poem.
One of the poem?s most distinctive voices is that
of the woman who speaks at the end of its second
section:
26
I can?t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
It?s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said
[158?159]
Her chatty tone and colloquial grammar and lexis
distinguish her voice from many others in the poem,
such as the formal and traditionally poetic voice of a
narrator that recurs many times in the poem:
Above the antique mantel was displayed
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
The change of Philomel
[97?99]
While the stylistic contrasts between these and
other voices are apparent to many readers, Eliot
does not explicitly mark the transitions between
them. The goal of the present work is to investigate
whether computational stylistic analysis can identify
the transition between one voice and the next.
Our unsupervised approach, informed by research
in topic segmentation (Hearst, 1994) and intrinsic
plagiarism detection (Stamatatos, 2009), is based
on deriving a curve representing stylistic change,
where the local maxima represent likely transition
points. Notably, our curve represents an amalga-
mation of different stylistic metrics, including those
that incorporate external (extrinsic) knowledge, e.g.
vector representations based on larger corpus co-
occurrence, which we show to be extremely use-
ful. For development and initial testing we follow
other work on stylistic inconsistency by using arti-
ficial (mixed) poems, but the our main evaluation is
on The Waste Land itself. We believe that even when
our segmentation disagrees with expert human judg-
ment, it has the potential to inform future study of
this literary work.
2 Related work
Poetry has been the subject of extensive computa-
tional analysis since the early days of literary and
linguistic computing (e.g., Beatie 1967). Most of the
research concerned either authorship attribution or
analysis of metre, rhyme, and phonetic properties of
the texts, but some work has studied the style, struc-
ture, and content of poems with the aim of better un-
derstanding their qualities as literary texts. Among
research that, like the present paper, looks at varia-
tion with a single text, Simonton (1990) found quan-
titative changes in lexical diversity and semantic
classes of imagery across the components of Shake-
speare?s sonnets, and demonstrated correlations be-
tween some of these measures and judgments of the
?aesthetic success? of individual sonnets. Duggan
(1973) developed statistical measures of formulaic
style to determine whether the eleventh-century epic
poem Chanson de Ronald manifests primarily an
oral or a written style. Also related to our work,
although it concerned a novel rather than a poem,
is that of McKenna and Antonia (2001), who used
principal component analysis of lexical frequency
to discriminate different voices (dialogue, interior
monologue, and narrative) and different narrative
styles in sections of Ulysses by James Joyce.
More general work on identifying stylistic incon-
sistency includes that of Graham et al. (2005), who
built artificial examples of style shift by concate-
nating Usenet postings by different authors. Fea-
ture sets for their neural network classifiers included
standard textual features, frequencies of function
words, punctuation and parts of speech, lexical en-
tropy, and vocabulary richness. Guthrie (2008) pre-
sented some general methods for identifying stylis-
tically anomalous segments using feature vector dis-
tance, and tested the effectiveness of his unsuper-
vised method with a number of possible stylistic
variations. He used features such as simple textual
metrics (e.g. word and sentence length), readability
measures, obscure vocabulary features, frequency
rankings of function words (which were not found
to be useful), and context analysis features from
the General Inquirer dictionary. The most effective
method ranked each segment according to the city-
block distance of its feature vector to the feature vec-
tor of the textual complement (the union of all other
segments in the text). Koppel et al. (2011) used a
semi-supervised method to identify segments from
two different books of the Bible artificially mixed
into a single text. They first demonstrated that, in
this context, preferred synonym use is a key stylis-
tic feature that can serve as high-precision boot-
strap for building a supervised SVM classifier on
more general features (common words); they then
used this classifier to provide an initial prediction
for each verse and smooth the results over adjacent
segments. The method crucially relied on properties
of the King James Version translation of the text in
27
order to identify synonym preferences.
The identification of stylistic inconsistency or het-
erogeneity has received particular attention as a
component of intrinsic plagiarism detection ? the
task of ?identify[ing] potential plagiarism by analyz-
ing a document with respect to undeclared changes
in writing style? (Stein et al., 2011). A typical ap-
proach is to move a sliding window over the text
looking for areas that are outliers with respect to the
style of the rest of the text, or which differ markedly
from other regions in word or character-trigram fre-
quencies (Oberreuter et al., 2011; Kestemont et al.,
2011). In particular, Stamatatos (2009) used a win-
dow that compares, using a special distance func-
tion, a character trigram feature vector at various
steps throughout the text, creating a style change
function whose maxima indicate points of interest
(potential plagarism).
Topic segmentation is a similar problem that has
been quite well-explored. A common thread in this
work is the importance of lexical cohesion, though
a large number of competing models based on this
concept have been proposed. One popular unsu-
pervised approach is to identify the points in the
text where a metric of lexical coherence is at a (lo-
cal) minimum (Hearst, 1994; Galley et al., 2003).
Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) also used a lexi-
cal coherence metric, but applied a graphical model
where segmentations are graph cuts chosen to max-
imize coherence of sentences within a segment, and
minimize coherence among sentences in different
segments. Another class of approaches is based
on a generative model of text, for instance HMMs
(Blei and Moreno, 2001) and Bayesian topic mod-
eling (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Eisenstein and
Barzilay, 2008); in such approaches, the goal is to
choose segment breaks that maximize the probabil-
ity of generating the text, under the assumption that
each segment has a different language model.
3 Stylistic change curves
Many popular text segmentation methods depend
crucially on a reliable textual unit (often a sentence)
which can be reliably classified or compared to oth-
ers. But, for our purposes here, a sentence is both
too small a unit ? our stylistic metrics will be more
accurate over larger spans ? and not small enough
? we do not want to limit our breaks to sentence
boundaries. Generative models, which use a bag-of-
words assumption, have a very different problem: in
their standard form, they can capture only lexical co-
hesion, which is not the (primary) focus of stylistic
analysis. In particular, we wish to segment using in-
formation that goes beyond the distribution of words
in the text being segmented. The model for stylis-
tic segmentation we propose here is related to the
TextTiling technique of Hearst (1994) and the style
change function of Stamatatos (2009), but our model
is generalized so that it applies to any numeric met-
ric (feature) that is defined over a span; importantly,
style change curves represent the change of a set of
very diverse features.
Our goal is to find the precise points in the text
where a stylistic change (a voice switch) occurs. To
do this, we calculate, for each token in the text, a
measure of stylistic change which corresponds to
the distance of feature vectors derived from a fixed-
length span on either side of that point. That is, if vi j
represents a feature vector derived from the tokens
between (inclusive) indices i and j, then the stylistic
change at point ci for a span (window) of size w is:
ci = Dist(v(i?w)(i?1),vi(i+w?1))
This function is not defined within w of the edge of
the text, and we generally ignore the possibility of
breaks within these (unreliable) spans. Possible dis-
tance metrics include cosine distance, euclidean dis-
tance, and city-block distance. In his study, Guthrie
(2008) found best results with city-block distance,
and that is what we will primarily use here. The fea-
ture vector can consist of any features that are de-
fined over a span; one important step, however, is to
normalize each feature (here, to a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1), so that different scaling of
features does not result in particular features having
an undue influence on the stylistic change metric.
That is, if some feature is originally measured to be
fi in the span i to i+w?1, then its normalized ver-
sion f ?i (included in vi(i+w?1)) is:
f ?i =
fi? f
? f
The local maxima of c represent our best predic-
tions for the stylistic breaks within a text. However,
28
stylistic change curves are not well behaved; they
may contain numerous spurious local maxima if a
local maximum is defined simply as a higher value
between two lower ones. We can narrow our def-
inition, however, by requiring that the local max-
imum be maximal within some window w?. That
is, our breakpoints are those points i where, for all
points j in the span x?w?, x+w?, it is the case that
gi > g j. As it happens, w? = w/2 is a fairly good
choice for our purposes, creating spans no smaller
than the smoothed window, though w? can be low-
ered to increase breaks, or increased to limit them.
The absolute height of the curve at each local min-
imum offers a secondary way of ranking (and elim-
inating) potential breakpoints, if more precision is
required; however, in our task here the breaks are
fairly regular but often subtle, so focusing only on
the largest stylistic shifts is not necessarily desirable.
4 Features
The set of features we explore for this task falls
roughly into two categories: surface and extrinsic.
The distinction is not entirely clear cut, but we wish
to distinguish features that use the basic properties
of the words or their PoS, which have traditionally
been the focus of automated stylistic analysis, from
features which rely heavily on external lexical infor-
mation, for instance word sentiment and, in partic-
ular, vector space representations, which are more
novel for this task.
4.1 Surface Features
Word length A common textual statistic in reg-
ister and readability studies. Readability, in turn,
has been used for plagiarism detection (Stein et al.,
2011), and related metrics were consistently among
the best for Guthrie (2008).
Syllable count Syllable count is reasonably good
predictor of the difficulty of a vocabulary, and is
used in some readability metrics.
Punctuation frequency The presence or absence
of punctuation such as commas, colons, semicolons
can be very good indicator of style. We also include
periods, which offer a measure of sentence length.
Line breaks Our only poetry-specific feature; we
count the number of times the end of a line appears
in the span. More or fewer line breaks (that is, longer
or shorter lines) can vary the rhythm of the text, and
thus its overall feel.
Parts of speech Lexical categories can indicate,
for instance, the degree of nominalization, which is
a key stylistic variable (Biber, 1988). We collect
statistics for the four main lexical categories (noun,
verb, adjective, adverb) as well as prepositions, de-
terminers, and proper nouns.
Pronouns We count the frequency of first-,
second-, and third-person pronouns, which can in-
dicate the interactiveness and narrative character of
a text (Biber, 1988).
Verb tense Past tense is often preferred in narra-
tives, whereas present tense can give a sense of im-
mediacy.
Type-token ratio A standard measure of lexical
diversity.
Lexical density Lexical density is the ratio of the
count of tokens of the four substantive parts of
speech to the count of all tokens.
Contextuality measure The contextuality mea-
sure of Heylighen and Dewaele (2002) is based on
PoS tags (e.g. nouns decrease contextuality, while
verbs increase it), and has been used to distin-
guish formality in collaboratively built encyclope-
dias (Emigh and Herring, 2005).
Dynamic In addition to the hand-picked features
above, we test dynamically including words and
character trigrams that are common in the text being
analyzed, particularly those not evenly distributed
throughout the text (we exclude punctuation). To
measure the latter, we define clumpiness as the
square root of the index of dispersion or variance-
to-mean ratio (Cox and Lewis, 1966) of the (text-
length) normalized differences between successive
occurrences of a feature, including (importantly) the
difference between the first index of the text and the
first occurrence of the feature as well as the last oc-
currence and the last index; the measure varies be-
tween 0 and 1, with 0 indicating perfectly even dis-
tribution. We test with the top n features based on
the ranking of the product of the feature?s frequency
29
in the text (tf ) or product of the frequency and its
clumpiness (tf-cl); this is similar to a tf-idf weight.
4.2 Extrinsic features
For those lexicons which include only lemmatized
forms, the words are lemmatized before their values
are retrieved.
Percent of words in Dale-Chall Word List A list
of 3000 basic words that is used in the Dale-Chall
Readability metric (Dale and Chall, 1995).
Average unigram count in 1T Corpus Another
metric of whether a word is commonly used. We use
the unigram counts in the 1T 5-gram Corpus (Brants
and Franz, 2006). Here and below, if a word is not
included it is given a zero.
Sentiment polarity The positive or negative
stance of a span could be viewed as a stylistic vari-
able. We test two lexicons, a hand-built lexicon for
the SO-CAL sentiment analysis system which has
shown superior performance in lexicon-based sen-
timent analysis (Taboada et al., 2011), and Senti-
WordNet (SWN), a high-coverage automatic lexicon
built from WordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). The
polarity of each word over the span is averaged.
Sentiment extremity Both lexicons provide a
measure of the degree to which a word is positive or
negative. Instead of summing the sentiment scores,
we sum their absolute values, to get a measure of
how extreme (subjective) the span is.
Formality Average formality score, using a lex-
icon of formality (Brooke et al., 2010) built using
latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Du-
mais, 1997).
Dynamic General Inquirer The General Inquirer
dictionary (Stone et al., 1966), which was used for
stylistic inconsistency detection by Guthrie (2008),
includes 182 content analysis tags, many of which
are relevant to style; we remove the two polarity tags
already part of the SO-CAL dictionary, and select
others dynamically using our tf-cl metric.
LSA vector features Brooke et al. (2010) have
posited that, in highly diverse register/genre corpora,
the lowest dimensions of word vectors derived us-
ing LSA (or other dimensionality reduction tech-
niques) often reflect stylistic concerns; they found
that using the first 20 dimensions to build their for-
mality lexicon provided the best results in a near-
synonym evaluation. Early work by Biber (1988)
in the Brown Corpus using a related technique (fac-
tor analysis) resulted in discovery of several identi-
fiable dimensions of register. Here, we investigate
using these LSA-derived vectors directly, with each
of the first 20 dimensions corresponding to a sepa-
rate feature. We test with vectors derived from the
word-document matrix of the ICWSM 2009 blog
dataset (Burton et al., 2009) which includes 1.3 bil-
lion tokens, and also from the BNC (Burnard, 2000),
which is 100 million tokens. The length of the vector
depends greatly on the frequency of the word; since
this is being accounted for elsewhere, we normalize
each vector to the unit circle.
5 Evaluation method
5.1 Metrics
To evaluate our method we apply standard topic
segmentation metrics, comparing the segmentation
boundaries to a gold standard reference. The mea-
sure Pk, proposed by Beeferman et al. (1997), uses a
probe window equal to half the average length of a
segment; the window slides over the text, and counts
the number of instances where a unit (in our case,
a token) at one edge of the window was predicted
to be in the same segment (according to the refer-
ence) as a unit at the other edge, but in fact is not; or
was predicted not to be in the same segment, but in
fact is. This count is normalized by the total number
of tests to get a score between 0 and 1, with 0 be-
ing a perfect score (the lower, the better). Pevzner
and Hearst (2002) criticize this metric because it
penalizes false positives and false negatives differ-
ently and sometimes fails to penalize false positives
altogether; their metric, WindowDiff (WD), solves
these problems by counting an error whenever there
is a difference between the number of segments in
the prediction as compared to the reference. Recent
work in topic segmentation (Eisenstein and Barzi-
lay, 2008) continues to use both metrics, so we also
present both here.
During initial testing, we noted a fairly serious
shortcoming with both these metrics: all else be-
ing equal, they will usually prefer a system which
30
predicts fewer breaks; in fact, a system that predicts
no breaks at all can score under 0.3 (a very com-
petitive result both here and in topic segmentation),
if the variation of the true segment size is reason-
ably high. This is problematic because we do not
want to be trivially ?improving? simply by moving
towards a model that is too cautious to guess any-
thing at all. We therefore use a third metric, which
we call BD (break difference), which sums all the
distances, calculated as fractions of the entire text,
between each true break and the nearest predicted
break. This metric is also flawed, because it can be
trivially made 0 (the best score) by guessing a break
everywhere. However, the relative motion of the two
kinds of metric provides insight into whether we are
simply moving along a precision/recall curve, or ac-
tually improving overall segmentation.
5.2 Baselines
We compare our method to the following baselines:
Random selection We randomly select bound-
aries, using the same number of boundaries in the
reference. We use the average over 50 runs.
Evenly spaced We put boundaries at equally
spaced points in the text, using the same number of
boundaries as the reference.
Random feature We use our stylistic change
curve method with a single feature which is created
by assigning a uniform random value to each token
and averaging across the span. Again, we use the
average score over 50 runs.
6 Experiments
6.1 Artificial poems
Our main interest is The Waste Land. It is, however,
prudent to develop our method, i.e. conduct an initial
investigation of our method, including parameters
and features, using a separate corpus. We do this by
building artificial mixed-style poems by combining
stylistically distinct poems from different authors, as
others have done with prose.
6.1.1 Setup
Our set of twelve poems used for this evaluation was
selected by one of the authors (an English literature
expert) to reflect the stylistic range and influences
of poetry at the beginning of the twentieth century,
and The Waste Land in particular. The titles were
removed, and each poem was tagged by an auto-
matic PoS tagger (Schmid, 1995). Koppel et al. built
their composite version of two books of the Bible by
choosing, at each step, a random span length (from a
uniform distribution) to include from one of the two
books being mixed, and then a span from the other,
until all the text in both books had been included.
Our method is similar, except that we first randomly
select six poems to include in the particular mixed
text, and at each step we randomly select one of po-
ems, reselecting if the poem has been used up or the
remaining length is below our lower bound. For our
first experiment, we set a lower bound of 100 tokens
and an upper bound of 200 tokens for each span; al-
though this gives a higher average span length than
that of The Waste Land, our first goal is to test
whether our method works in the (ideal) condition
where the feature vectors at the breakpoint gener-
ally represent spans which are purely one poem or
another for a reasonably high w (100). We create 50
texts using this method. In addition to testing each
individual feature, we test several combinations of
features (all features, all surface features, all extrin-
sic features), and present the best results for greedy
feature removal, starting with all features (exclud-
ing dynamic ones) and choosing features to remove
which minimize the sum of the three metrics.
6.1.2 Results
The Feature Sets section of Table 1 gives the in-
dividual feature results for segmentation of the
artificially-combined poems. Using any of the fea-
tures alone is better than our baselines, though some
of the metrics (in particular type-token ratio) are
only a slight improvement. Line breaks are obvi-
ously quite useful in the context of poetry (though
the WD score is high, suggesting a precision/recall
trade-off), but so are more typical stylistic features
such as the distribution of basic lexical categories
and punctuation. The unigram count and formal-
ity score are otherwise the best two individual fea-
tures. The sentiment-based features did more mod-
estly, though the extremeness of polarity was use-
ful when paired with the coverage of SentiWord-
Net. Among the larger feature sets, the GI was the
least useful, though more effective than any of the
31

individual features, while dynamic word and char-
acter trigrams did better, and the ICWSM LSA vec-
tors better still; the difference in size between the
ICWSM and BNC is obviously key to the perfor-
mance difference here. In general using our tf-cl
metric was better than tf alone.
When we combine the different feature types, we
see that extrinsic features have a slight edge over the
surface features, but the two do complement each
other to some degree. Although the GI and dynamic
feature sets do well individually, they do not com-
bine well with other features in this unsupervised
setting, and our best results do not include them.
The greedy feature selector removed 4 LSA dimen-
sions, type-token ratio, prepositions, second-person
pronouns, adverbs, and verbs to get our best result.
Our choice of w to be the largest fully-reliable size
(100) seems to be a good one, as is our use of city-
block distance rather than the alternatives. Overall,
the metrics we are using for evaluation suggest that
we are roughly halfway to perfect segmentation.
6.2 The Waste Land
6.2.1 Setup
In order to evaluate our method on The Waste Land,
we first created a gold standard voice switch seg-
mentation. Our gold standard represents an amal-
gamation, by one of the authors, of several sources
of information. First, we enlisted a class of 140 un-
dergraduates in an English literature course to seg-
ment the poem into voices based on their own intu-
itions, and we created a combined student version
based on majority judgment. Second, our English
literature expert listened to the 6 readings of the
poem included on The Waste Land app (Touch Press
LLP, 2011), including two readings by T.S. Eliot,
and noted places where the reader?s voice seemed
to change; these were combined to create a reader
version. Finally, our expert amalgamated these two
versions and incorporated insights from independent
literary analysis to create a final gold standard.
We created two versions of the poem for evalua-
tion: for both versions, we removed everything but
the main body of the text (i.e. the prologue, dedi-
cation, title, and section titles), since these are not
produced by voices in the poem. The ?full? ver-
sion contains all the other text (a total of 68 voice
32
switches), but our ?abridged? version involves re-
moving all segments (and the corresponding voice
switches, when appropriate) which are 20 or fewer
tokens in length and/or which are in a language
other than English, which reduces the number of
voice switches to 28 (the token count is 3179). This
version allows us to focus on the segmentation for
which our method has a reasonable chance of suc-
ceeding and ignore the segmentation of non-English
spans, which is relatively trivial but yet potentially
confounding. We use w = 50 for the full version,
since there are almost twice as many breaks as in
the abridged version (and our artificially generated
texts).
6.2.2 Results
Our results for The Waste Land are presented in Ta-
ble 2. Notably, in this evaluation, we do not investi-
gate the usefulness of individual features or attempt
to fully optimize our solution using this text. Our
goal is to see if a general stylistic segmentation sys-
tem, developed on artificial texts, can be applied suc-
cessfully to the task of segmenting an actual stylis-
tically diverse poem. The answer is yes. Although
the task is clearly more difficult, the results for the
system are well above the baseline, particularly for
the abridged version. One thing to note is that using
the features greedily selected for the artificial sys-
tem (instead of just all features) appears to hinder,
rather than help; this suggests a supervised approach
might not be effective. The GI is too unreliable to
be useful here, whereas the dynamic word and tri-
gram features continue to do fairly well, but they do
not improve the performance of the rest of the fea-
tures combined. Once again the LSA features seem
to play a central role in this success. We manually
compared predicted with real switches and found
that there were several instances (corresponding to
very clear voices switches in the text) which were
nearly perfect. Moreover, the model did tend to pre-
dict more switches in sections with numerous real
switches, though these predictions were often fewer
than the gold standard and out of sync (because the
sampling windows never consisted of a pure style).
7 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented a system for auto-
matically segmenting stylistically inconsistent text

and applied it to The Waste Land, a well-known
poem in which stylistic variation, in the form of dif-
ferent ?voices?, provides an interesting challenge to
both human and computer readers. Our unsuper-
vised model is based on a stylistic change curve de-
rived from feature vectors. Perhaps our most inter-
esting result is the usefulness of low-dimension LSA
vectors over surface features such as words and tri-
gram characters as well as other extrinsic features
such as the GI dictionary. In both The Waste Land
and our development set of artificially combined po-
ems, our method performs well above baseline. Our
system could probably benefit from the inclusion of
machine learning, but our main interest going for-
ward is the inclusion of additional features ? in par-
ticular, poetry-specific elements such as alliteration
and other more complex lexicogrammatical features.
