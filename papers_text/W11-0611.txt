Abstract
Since many real-world concepts are associ-
ated with colour, for example danger with red,
linguistic information is often complimented
with the use of appropriate colours in informa-
tion visualization and product marketing. Yet,
there is no comprehensive resource that cap-
tures concept?colour associations. We present
a method to create a large word?colour as-
sociation lexicon by crowdsourcing. We fo-
cus especially on abstract concepts and emo-
tions to show that even though they cannot be
physically visualized, they too tend to have
strong colour associations. Finally, we show
how word?colour associations manifest them-
selves in language, and quantify usefulness of
co-occurrence and polarity cues in automati-
cally detecting colour associations.1
1 Introduction
Colour is a vital component in the successful deliv-
ery of information, whether it is in marketing a com-
mercial product (Sable and Akcay, 2010), design-
ing webpages (Meier, 1988; Pribadi et al, 1990), or
visualizing information (Christ, 1975; Card et al,
1999). Since real-world concepts have associations
with certain colour categories (for example, danger
with red, and softness with pink), complimenting
linguistic and non-linguistic information with appro-
priate colours has a number of benefits, including:
1This paper is an extended, non-archival, version of the short
paper?Mohammad (2011). It provides additional details on the
analysis of crowdsourced data, and experiments on the manifes-
tations of word?colour associations in WordNet and in text. It
also proposes a polarity-based automatic method.
(1) strengthening the message (improving semantic
coherence), (2) easing cognitive load on the receiver,
(3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evoking
the desired emotional response. Consider, for exam-
ple, the use of red in stop signs. Drivers are able
to recognize the sign faster, and it evokes a sublim-
inal emotion pertaining to danger, which is entirely
appropriate in the context. The use of red to show
areas of high crime rate in a visualization is another
example of good use of colour to draw emotional re-
sponse. On the other hand, improper use of colour
can be more detrimental to understanding than using
no colour (Marcus, 1982; Meier, 1988).
Most languages have expressions involving
colour, and many of these express sentiment. Exam-
ples in English include: green with envy, blue blood
(an aristocrat), greener pastures (better avenues),
yellow-bellied (cowardly), red carpet (special treat-
ment), and looking through rose-tinted glasses (be-
ing optimistic). Further, new expressions are con-
tinually coined, for example, grey with uncertainty
from Bianca Marsden?s poem Confusion.2 Thus,
knowledge of concept?colour associations may also
be useful for automatic natural language systems
such as textual entailment, paraphrasing, machine
translation, and sentiment analysis.
A word has strong association with a colour when
the colour is a salient feature of the concept the
word refers to, or because the word is related to
a such a concept. Many concept?colour associa-
tions, such as swan with white and vegetables with
green, involve physical entities. However, even ab-
stract notions and emotions may have colour as-

sociations (honesty?white, danger?red, joy?yellow,
anger?red). Further, many associations are culture-
specific (Gage, 1969; Chen, 2005). For example,
prosperity is associated with red in much of Asia.
Unfortunately, there exists no lexicon with any
significant coverage that captures concept?colour
associations, and a number of questions remain
unanswered, such as, the extent to which humans
agree on these associations, and whether physical
concepts are more likely to have a colour association
than abstract ones. We expect that the word?colour
associations manifest themselves as co-occurrences
in text and speech, but there have been no studies to
show the extent to which words co-occur more with
associated colours than with other colours.
In this paper, we describe how we created a large
word?colour association lexicon by crowdsourcing
with effective quality control measures (Section 3).
We used a word-choice question to guide the anno-
tators toward the desired senses of the target words,
and also to determine if the annotators know the
meanings of the words.
We conducted several experiments to measure the
consensus in word?colour associations, and how
these associations manifest themselves in language.
Specifically, we show that:
? More than 30% of terms have a strong colour
association (Sections 4).
? About 33% of thesaurus categories have strong
colour associations (Section 5).
? Abstract terms have colour associations almost
as often as physical entities do (Section 6).
? There is a strong association of emotions and
polarities with colours (Section 7).
? Word-colour association manifests itself as
closeness in WordNet (to a smaller extent), and
as high co-occurrence in text (to a greater ex-
tent) (Section 8).
Finally, we present an automatic method to de-
termine word?colour association that relies on co-
occurrence and polarity cues, but no labeled infor-
mation of word?colour associations. It obtains an
accuracy of more than 60%. Comparatively, the
random choice and most-frequent class supervised
baselines obtain only 9.1% and 33.3%, respectively.
Such approaches can be used to for creating similar
lexicons in other languages.
2 Related Work
The relation between language and cognition has re-
ceived considerable attention over the years, mainly
on answering whether language impacts thought,
and if so, to what extent. Experiments with
colour categories have been used both to show
that language has an effect on thought (Brown and
Lenneberg, 1954; Ratner, 1989) and that it does not
(Bornstein, 1985). However, that line of work does
not explicitly deal with word?colour associations. In
fact, we did not find any other academic work that
gathered large word?colour associations. There is,
however, a commercial endeavor?Cymbolism3.
Child et al (1968), Ou et al (2011), and others
show that people of different ages and genders have
different colour preferences. (See also the online
study by Joe Hallock4.) In this work, we are inter-
ested in identifying words that have a strong associa-
tion with a colour due to their meaning; associations
that are not affected by age and gender preferences.
There is substantial work on inferring the emo-
tions evoked by colour (Luscher, 1969; Xin et al,
2004; Kaya, 2004). Strapparava and Ozbal (2010)
compute corpus-based semantic similarity between
emotions and colours. We combine the word?colour
and word?emotion association lexicons to determine
the correlation between emotion-associated words
and colours.
Berlin and Kay (1969), and later Kay and Maffi
(1999), showed that often colour terms appeared in
languages in certain groups. If a language has only
two colour terms, then they are white and black. If a
language has three colour terms, then they are white,
black, and red. If a language has four colour terms,
then they are white, black, red, and green, and so
on up to eleven colours. From these groupings, the
colours can be ranked as follows:
1. white, 2. black, 3. red, 4. green, 5. yel-
low, 6. blue, 7. brown, 8. pink, 9. purple,
10. orange, 11. grey (1)
We will refer to the above ranking as the Berlin and
Kay (B&K) order. There are hundreds of differ-
ent words for colours.5 To make our task feasible,

5See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of colors
98
we needed to choose a relatively small list of basic
colours. We chose to use the eleven basic colour
words of Berlin and Kay (1969).
The MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart,
1981) has, among other information, the imageabil-
ity ratings for 9240 words.6 The imageability rat-
ing is a score given by human judges that reflects
how easy it is to visualize the concept. It is a scale
from 100 (very hard to visualize) to 700 (very easy
to visualize). We use the ratings in our experiments
to determine whether there is a correlation between
imageability and strength of colour association.
3 Crowdsourcing
Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online
crowdsourcing platform that is especially well suited
for tasks that can be done over the Internet through
a computer or a mobile device.7 It is already being
used to obtain human annotation on various linguis-
tic tasks (Snow et al, 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).
However, one must define the task carefully to ob-
tain annotations of high quality. Several checks must
be placed to ensure that random and erroneous anno-
tations are discouraged, rejected, and re-annotated.
We used Mechanical Turk to obtain word?colour
association annotations on a large-scale. Each task
is broken into small independently solvable units
called HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) and up-
loaded on the Mechanical Turk website. The peo-
ple who provide responses to these HITs are called
Turkers. The annotation provided by a Turker for a
HIT is called an assignment.
We used the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard,
1986) as the source for terms to be annotated. The-
sauri, such as the Roget?s and Macquarie, group
related words into categories. The Macquarie has
about a thousand categories, each having about a
hundred or so related terms. Each category has a
head word that best represents the words in it. The
categories can be thought of as coarse senses or con-
cepts (Yarowsky, 1992). If a word is ambiguous,
then it is listed in more than one category. Since
a word may have different colour associations when
used in different senses, we obtained annotations at
word-sense level. We chose to annotate words that
6http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/mrcdatabase/uwa mrc.htm
7Mechanical Turk: www.mturk.com
had one to five senses in the Macquarie Thesaurus
and occurred frequently in the Google N-gram Cor-
pus. We annotated more than 10,000 of these word?
sense pairs by creating HITs as described below.
Each HIT has a set of questions, all of which are
to be answered by the same person. We requested
annotations from five different Turkers for each HIT.
(A Turker cannot attempt multiple assignments for
the same term.) A complete HIT is shown below:
Q1. Which word is closest in meaning to sleep?
? car ? tree ? nap ? olive
Q2. What colour is associated with sleep?
? black
? blue
? brown
? green
? grey
? orange
? purple
? pink
? red
? white
? yellow
Q1 is a word-choice question generated automati-
cally by taking a near-synonym from the thesaurus
and random distractors. The near-synonym also
guides the annotator to the desired sense of the word.
Further, it encourages the annotator to think clearly
about the target word?s meaning; we believe this im-
proves the quality of the annotations in Q2. If a word
has multiple senses, that is, it is listed in more than
one thesaurus category, then separate questionnaires
are generated for each sense. Thus we obtain colour
associations at a word-sense level.
If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then we
discard information obtained from both Q1 and Q2.
Thus, even though we do not have correct answers
to Q2, likely incorrect annotations are filtered out.
About 10% of the annotations were discarded be-
cause of an incorrect answer to Q1. Terms with less
than three valid annotations were removed from fur-
ther analysis. Each of the remaining terms had, on
average, 4.45 distinct annotations.
The colour options in Q2 were presented in ran-
dom order. Observe that we do not provide a ?not
associated with any colour? option. This encourages
colour selection even if the annotator felt the associ-
ation was weak. If there is no association between
a word and a colour, then we expect low agreement
amongst the annotators. The survey was approved
by the ethics board at the authors? institution.

4 Word?Colour Association
The information from multiple annotators was com-
bined by taking the majority vote, resulting in a
lexicon of 8,813 entries. Each entry contains a
unique word?synonym pair (from Q1), majority-
voted colour, and a confidence score?number of
votes for the colour / number of total votes. (For the
analyses in the rest of the paper, ties were broken
by picking one colour at random.) A separate ver-
sion of the lexicon that includes entries for all of the
valid annotations by each of the annotators is also
available.8
The first row, overall, in Table 1 shows the per-
centage of times different colours were associated
with the target term. The second row, voted, shows
percentages after taking a majority vote from multi-
ple annotators. Observe that even though the colour
options were presented in random order, the order of
the most frequently associated colours is identical to
the Berlin and Kay order (Section 2:(1)).
Table 2 shows how often the size of the majority
class in colour associations is one, two, three, four,
and five. Since the annotators were given eleven
colour options to choose from, if we assume inde-
pendence, then the chance that none of the five an-
notators agrees with each other (majority class size
of one) is 1?10/11?9/11?8/11?7/11 = 0.344.
Thus, if there was no correlation among any of the
terms and colours, then 34.4% of the time none of
the annotators would have agreed. However, this
happens only 15.1% of the time. A large number
of terms have a majority class size ? 2 (84.9%),
and thus more than chance association with a colour.
One can argue that terms with a majority class size
? 3 (32%) have strong colour associations.
Below are some reasons why agreement values
are much lower than those obtained for certain other
tasks, for example, part of speech tagging:
? The annotators were not given a ?not associ-
ated with any colour? option. Low agreement

for certain instances is an indicator that these
words have weak, if any, colour association.
? Words are associated with colours to differ-
ent degrees. Some words may be associated
with more than one colour in comparable de-
grees, and there might be higher disagreement
for such instances.
? The target word is presented out of context. We
expect higher agreement if we provided words
in particular contexts, but words can occur in
innumerable contexts, and annotating too many
instances of the same word is costly.
Nonetheless, the term?colour association lexicon
is useful for downstream applications because any
of the following strategies may be employed: (1)
choosing colour associations from only those in-
stances with high agreement, (2) assuming low-
agreement terms have no colour association, (3) de-
termining colour association of a category through
information from many words, as described in the
next section.
5 Category?Colour Association
Words within a thesaurus category may not be
strongly associated with any colour, or they may
each be associated with many different colours.
We now describe experiments to determine whether
there exist categories where the semantic coherence
carries over to a strong common association with
one colour.
We determine the strength of colour association
of a category by first determining the colour c most
associated with the terms in it, and then calculating
the ratio of the number of times a word from the cat-
egory is associated with c to the number of words in
the category associated with any colour. Only cate-
100
Figure 1: Scatter plot of thesaurus categories. The area of high colour association is shaded. Some points are labeled.
gories that had at least four words that also appear
in the word?colour lexicon were considered; 535 of
the 812 categories from Macquarie Thesaurus met
this condition.
If a category has exactly four words that appear in
the colour lexicon, and if all four words are associ-
ated with different colours, then the category has the
lowest possible strength of colour association?0.25
(1/4). 19 categories had a score of 0.25. No category
had a score less than 0.25. Any score above 0.25
shows more than random chance association with
a colour. There were 516 such categories (96.5%).
177 categories (33.1%) had a score 0.5 or above, that
is, half or more of the words in these categories are
associated with one colour. We consider these to
be strong associations, and a gold standard for au-
tomatic measures of association.
6 Imageability and Colour Association
It is natural for physical entities of a certain colour
to be associated with that colour. However, abstract
concepts such as danger and excitability are also as-
sociated with colours?red and orange, respectively.
Figure 1 displays an experiment to determine
whether there is a correlation between imageability
and association with colour.
We define imageability of a thesaurus category to
be the average of the imageability ratings of words
in it. We calculated imageability for the 535 cate-
gories described in the previous section using only
the words that appear in the colour lexicon. Figure 1
shows the scatter plot of these categories on the im-
ageability and strength of colour association axes.
The colour association was calculated as described
in the previous section.
If higher imageability correlated with greater ten-
dency to have a colour association, then we would
see most of the points along the diagonal moving
up from left to right. Instead, we observe that the
strongly associated categories (points in the shaded
region) are spread across the imageability axis, im-
plying that there is only weak, if any, correlation be-
tween imageability and strength of association with
colour. Imageability and colour association have a
Pearson?s product moment correlation of 0.116, and
a Spearman rank order correlation of 0.102.
7 The Colour of Emotion Words
Emotions such as joy and anger are abstract concepts
dealing with one?s psychological state. Mohammad
and Turney (2010) created a crowdsourced term?
emotion association lexicon consisting of associa-
tions of over 10,000 word-sense pairs with eight
emotions?joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust,
surprise, and anticipation?argued to be the basic
and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980). We
combine their term?emotion association lexicon and
our term?colour lexicon to determine the colour sig-
nature of different emotions?the rows in Table 3.
The top two most frequently associated colours with
each of the eight emotions are shown in bold. For
example, the ?anger? row shows the percentage of

anger terms associated with different colours.
We see that all of the emotions have strong associ-
ations with certain colours. Observe that anger is as-
sociated most with red. Other negative emotions?
disgust, fear, sadness?go strongest with black.
Among the positive emotions: anticipation is most
frequently associated with white and green; joy with
white, green, and yellow; and trust with white, blue,
and green. Thus, colour can add to the emotional
potency of visualizations.
The Mohammad and Turney (2010) lexicon also
has associations with positive and negative polar-
ity. We combine these term?polarity associations
with term?colour associations to show the colour
signature for positive and negative terms?the rows
of Table 4. We observe that some colours tend
to, more often than not, have strong positive asso-
ciations (white, green, yellow, blue, pink, and or-
ange), whereas others have strong negative associa-
tions (black, red, brown, and grey).
8 Manifestation of Concept?Colour
Association in WordNet and in Text
8.1 Closeness in WordNet
Colour terms are listed in WordNet, and interest-
ingly, they are fairly ambiguous. Therefore, they
can be found in many different synsets (see Table
5). A casual examination of WordNet reveals that
some synsets (or concepts) are close to their associ-
ated colour?s synset. For example, darkness is a hy-
pernym of black and inflammation is one hop away
from red. It is plausible that if a concept is strongly
associated with a certain colour, then such concept?
colour pairs will be close to each other in a seman-
tic network such as WordNet. If so, the semantic
closeness of a word with each of the eleven basic
colours in WordNet can be used to automatically de-
termine the colour most associated with the 177 the-
saurus categories from the gold standard described
in Section 5 earlier. We determine closeness using
two similarity measures?Jiang and Conrath (1997)
and Lin (1997)?and two relatedness measures?
Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and gloss vec-
tor overlap (Pedersen et al, 2004)?from the Word-
Net Similarity package.
For each thesaurus category?colour pair, we
summed the WordNet closeness of each of the terms
in the category to the colour. The colour with the
highest sum is chosen as the one closest to the the-
saurus category. Section (c) and section (d) of Ta-
ble 8.2, show how often the closest colours are also
the colours most associated with the gold standard
categories. Section (a) lists some unsupervised base-
lines. Random-choice baseline is the score obtained
when a colour is chosen at random (1/11 = 9.1%).
Another baseline is a system that always chooses the
most frequent colour in a corpus. Section (a) reports
three such baseline scores obtained by choosing the
most frequently occurring colour in three separate
corpora. Section (b) lists a supervised baseline ob-
tained by choosing the colour most commonly asso-

ciated with a categories in the gold standard. The
automatic measures listed in sections (c) through (f)
do not have access to this information.
Observe that the relatedness measures are
markedly better than the similarity measures at iden-
tifying the true associated colour. Yet, for a major-
ity of the thesaurus categories the closest colour in
WordNet is not the most associated colour.
8.2 Co-occurrence in Text
Physical entities that tend to have a certain colour
tend to be associated with that colour. For example
leaves are associated with green. Intuition suggests
that these entities will co-occur with the associated
colours more often than with any other colour. As
language has expressions such as green with envy
and feeling blue, we also expect that certain abstract
notions, such as envy and sadness, will co-occur
more often with their associated colours, green and
blue respectively, more often than with any other
colour. We now describe experiments to determine
the extent to which target concepts co-occur in text
most often with their associated colours.
We selected three corpora to investigate occur-
rences of colour terms: the British National Corpus
(BNC) (Burnard, 2000), the Google N-gram Cor-
pus (GNC), and the Google Books Corpus (GBC)
(Michel et al, 2011).9 The BNC, a 100 million
word corpus, is considered to be fairly balanced with
9The BNC is available at: http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk.
The GNC is available through the Linguistic Data Consortium.
The GBC is available at http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets.
text from various domains. The GNC is a trillion-
word web coprus. The GBC is a digitized version
of about 5.2 million books, and the English portion
has about 361 billion words. The GNC and GBC are
distributed as collections of 1-gram to 5-gram files.
Table 6 shows the frequencies and ranks of the
eleven basic colour terms in the BNC and the uni-
gram files of GNC and GBC. The ranking is from the
most frequent to the least frequent colour in the cor-
pus. The last column lists the Spearman rank order
correlation (?) of the rankings with the Berlin and
Kay ranks (1969) (listed in Section 2:(1)). Observe
that order of the colours from most frequent to least
frequent in the GNC and GBC have a strong corre-
lation with the order proposed by Berlin and Kay,
especially so for the rankings obtained from counts
in the Google Books Corpus.
For each of the 177 gold standard thesaurus cate-
gories, we determined the conditional probability of
co-occurring with different colour terms in the BNC,
GNC, and GBC. The total co-occurrence frequency
of a category with a colour was calculated by sum-
ming up the co-occurrence frequency of each of the
terms in it with the colour term. We used a four-
word window as context. The counts from GNC and
GBC were determined using the fivegram files. Sec-
tion (e) in Table 8.2 shows how often the colour with
the highest conditional probability is also the colour
most associated with a category. These numbers are
higher than the baselines (a and b), as well as the
scores obtained by the WordNet approaches (c).
From Table 5 in Section 7, we know that some

Table 7: Percentage of times the colour chosen by auto-
matic method is also the colour identified by annotators
as most associated to a thesaurus category.
colours tend to be strongly positive and others neg-
ative. We wanted to determine how useful these po-
larity cues can be in identifying the colour most as-
sociated with a category. We used the automatically
generated Macquarie Semantic Orientation Lexicon
(MSOL) (Mohammad et al, 2009) to determine if a
thesaurus category is positive or negative.10 A cat-
egory is marked as negative if it has more negative
words than positive, otherwise it is marked as pos-
itive. If a category is positive, then co-occurrence
cues were used to select a colour from only the
positive colours (white, green, yellow, blue, pink,
and orange), whereas if a category is negative, then
co-occurrence cues select from only the negative
colours (black, red, brown, and grey). Section (f) of
Table 8.2 provides results with this method. Observe
that these numbers are a marked improvement over
Section (e) numbers, suggesting that polarity cues
can be very useful in determining concept?colour
association.
10MSOL is available at http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/?saif/
WebPages/ResearchInterests.html#semanticorientation.
Counts from the GNC yielded poorer results com-
pared to the much smaller BNC, and the somewhat
smaller GBC possibly because frequency counts
from GNC are available only for those n-grams that
occur at least thirty times. Further, GBC and BNC
are both collections of edited texts, and so expected
to be cleaner than the GNC which is a corpus ex-
tracted from the World Wide Web.
9 Conclusions and Future Work
We created a large word?colour association lexi-
con by crowdsourcing, which we will make pub-
licly available. Word-choice questions were used to
guide the annotators to the desired senses of the tar-
get words, and also as a gold questions for identi-
fying malicious annotators (a common problem in
crowdsourcing). We found that more than 32% of
the words and 33% of the Macquarie Thesaurus cat-
egories have a strong association with one of the
eleven colours chosen for the experiment. We an-
alyzed abstract concepts, emotions in particular, and
showed that they too have strong colour associa-
tions. Thus, using the right colours in tasks such
as information visualization and web development,
can not only improve semantic coherence but also
inspire the desired emotional response.
Interestingly, we found that frequencies of colour
associations follow the same order in which colour
terms occur in different languages (Berlin and Kay,
1969). The frequency-based ranking of colour terms
in the BNC, GNC, and GBC also had a high correla-
tion with the Berlin and Kay order.
Finally, we show that automatic methods that rely
on co-occurrence and polarity cues alone, and no la-
beled information of word?colour association, can
accurately estimate the colour associated with a con-
cept more than 60% of the time. The random choice
and supervised baselines for this task are 9.1% and
33.3%, respectively. We are interested in using
word?colour associations as a feature in sentiment
analysis and for paraphrasing.
