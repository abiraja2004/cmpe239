Abstract 
This paper discusses a case study in which lexical semantic techniques were used to implement a
prototype scoring system for short-answer, f ee-responses to test questions. Scoring, as it is discussed in 
this paper, is a kind of clasgification problem. Responses are automatically scored by being assigned 
appropriate classifications. The ultimate goal is to develop a scoring system which can reliably analyze 
response content. 
For this study, a domain-specific, concept-based lexicon, and a concept grammar were built to represent 
the response set, using 200 of 378 responses from the original data set. The lexicon is built, from 
individual words, and 2-word and 3-word terms from the training data. The lexicon is best characterized 
by Bergler's (1995) layered lexicon. Concept grammar rules are built by mapping concepts from the 
lexicon onto the concept-structure patterns present in a set of training responses. Previous attempts to 
score these responses using lexically-based statistical techniques and structure-independent content 
grammars were not reliable (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)). The results discussed in this paper illustrate 
the reliability of the lexical semantic methods used in the study.

1. Introduction 
There is a movement in testing to augment the conventional multiple-choice items (i.e., test questions) 
with short-answer f ee-response items. Due to the large volume of tests administered yearly by 
Educational Testing Service (ETS), hand-scoring of these tests with these types of items is costly and 
time-consuming for practical testing programs. ETS is currently working on natural language 
understanding systems which could be used for computer-assisted scoring of short-answer free- 
responses ( ee Kaplan and Bennett (1994) and Burstein and Kaplan (1995))) 
The overall goal of our current research is to develop a scoring system that can handle short-answer 
free-response it ms. Such a scoring system has to be able to identify the relevant content of a response 
and assign it to an appropriate content category. Another consideration i the development of a scoring 
system is that the data sets that are available to us are relatively small, and the responses in these data 
sets lack lexico-~syntactic patterning. The items which we work with are either experimental, or have 
been administered aspaper-and-pencil exams. In the former case, there is a limited subject pool, and in 
the latter case, we rely on what has been put into electronic form. The response sets typically range 
from 300-700 responses which we have to use for training and testing. This is quite a different scenario 
from natural anguage understanding systems which can be designed using large corpora from full text 
sources, such as the AP News and the Wall Street Journal. This paper discusses a case study that 
examined how lexical semantic techniques could be used to build scoring systems, based on small data 
sets. Previous attempts to classify these responses using lexically-based statistical techniques and 
structure-independent co tent grammars were not reliable (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)). The results of 
this case study illustrate the reliability of lexical semantic methods. 
For this study, a concept-based lexicon and a concept grammar were built to represent a response set. 
The lexicon can best be characterized by Bergler's (1995) layered lexicon in that the list of lexical entry 
words and terms can remain constant, while the features associated with each entry are modular, so that 
they can be replaced as necessary. Concepts in the concept grammars were linked to the lexicon. In this 
paper, concepts are superordinate rms which contain one or more subordinate, metonymic terms. A 
prototype was implemented to test our hypothesis that a lexical semantics approach to scoring would 
yield accurate results. 
2. Test Item Types, Response Sets, and Lexical Semantics 
2.1 Test Item Types and Response Sets 
Our previous research with regard to language use in test items revealed that different est items use 
domain-specific language (Kaplan and Bennett (1994)). Lexicons restricted to dictionary knowledge 
of words are not sufficient for interpreting the meaning of responses for unique items. Concept 
knowledge bases built from an individual data set of examinee responses can be useful for 
representing domain-specific language. To illustrate the use of such knowledge bases in the 
development of scoring systems, linguistic information from the response set of an inferencing item 
~In this paper, a response r fers to an examinees 15 - 20 word answer to an item which can be either in the form of a 
complete sentence orsentence fragment. 
21 
will be discussed. For this item type, examinees are reliant on real-world knowledge with regard to 
item topic, and responses are based on an examinees own ability to draw inferences. 
Responses do not appear show typical features of sublanguage in that there are no domain-specific 
structures, and the vocabulary is not as restricted. Therefore, sublanguage t chniques such as Sager 
(1981) and Smadja (1993) do not work. In situations where lexico-syntactic patterning is deficient, a
lexicon with specified metonymic relations can be developed to yield accurate scoring of response 
content. We define metonyms as words which can be used in place of one another when they have a 
domain-specific relation (Gerstl (1991)) 
2.2 Using Lexical Semantics for Response Representation 
Our goal in building a scoring system for free-responses is to be able to classify individual responses 
by content, as well as to determine when responses have duplicate meaning (i.e., one response is the 
paraphrase of another esponse). In previous research, we used a concept-based approach similar to 
the one described in this study. The difference between the previous system and our current 
prototype is that in the previous ystem, concepts were not represented with regard to structure, and 
the lexicon was domain-independent. The underspecification f concept-structure relationships, and 
the lack of a domain-specific lexicon degraded the performance of that system (Kaplan and Bennett 
(1994). A second lexically-based, statistical approach performed poorly for the same reasons 
described above. The second approach looked at similarity measures between responses based on 
lexical overlap. Again, structure was not considered, and the lexicon was domain-independent which 
contributed to the system's poor performance (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)). 
Any system we build must have the ability to analyze the concept-structure patterning in a response, 
so that response content can be recognized for sconng purposes. Given our small data set, our 
assumption was that a lexical semantic approach which employed omain-specific language and 
concept grammars with concept-structure patterns would facilitate reliable scoring. Our hypothesis 
is that this type of representation would denote the content of a response based on its lexical 
meanings and their relationship to the syntactic structure of the response. 
It would appear that Jackendoff's (1983) Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) representation may be 
applicable to our problem. These structures are considered to be conceptual universals and have been 
successfully used by Dorr, et al(1995) and Holland (1994) in natural anguage understanding tasks. 
Holland points out, however, that LCSs cannot represent domain knowledge, nor can they handle the 
interpretation f negation and quantification, all of which are necessary in our scoring systems. Holland 
also states that LCSs could not represent a near-match between the two sentences, The person bought a 
vehicle, and The man bought a car. As is discussed later in the paper, our scoring systems must be able 
to deal with such near-match responses. Based on the above-mentioned limitations of LCSs, the use of 
such representation for scoring systems does not seem compatible with our response classification 
problem.

3. The Formulating-Hypotheses Item 2 
Responses from the Formulating-Hypotheses it m (F-H) were used in this study. F-H is an 
experimental inferencing item in which an examinee is presented with a short passage (about 30 
words) in which a hypothetical situation is described, and s/he composes up to 15 hypotheses that 
could explain Why the situation exists. Examinee responses do not have to be in complete sentences, 
and can be up tO 15 words in length. For example, an item referred to as the police item describes a 
situation in which the number of police being killed has reduced over a 20-year period. The 
examinee is theasked to give reasons as to why this might have occurred. Sample responses are 
illustrated in (1). 
(1) Sample correct responses to the police item 
a. Better cadet raining programs 
b. Police wear bullet-proof vests 
c. Better economic ircumstances mean less crime. 
d. Advanced medical technology has made it possible to save more 
lives. 
e. Crooks now have a decreased ability to purchase guns. 
3.1 Required Scoring Tasks for F-H 
Our task is to create a system which will score the data using the same criteria used in hand-scoring. 
In the hand-scoring process, test developers (i.e., the individuals who create and score exams) create 
a multiple-category rubric, that is, a scoring key, in which each category is associated with a set of 
correct or incorrect responses. A multiple-category rubric must be created to capture any possible 
response duplication that could occur in the examinees multiple response file. For instance, if an 
examinee had two responses, Better trained police, and Cops are more highly trained, the scoring 
system must identify these two responses as duplicates which should not both count toward the final 
score. Another reason for multiple-category assignment is to be able to provide content-relevant 
explanations as to why a response was scored a certain way. Our current prototype was designed to 
classify responses according to a set of training responses which had been hand-scored by test 
developers in a multiple-category rubric they had developed. For the police data set, there were 47 
categories associated with a set of 200 training responses. Each rubric category had between 1 and 
10 responses. 
3.2. Characterization of police training data 
The training set responses have insufficient lexico-syntactic overlap to rely on lexical co-occurrence 
and frequencies to yield content information. For instance, police and better occur frequently, but in 
varying structures, uch as in the responses, Police officers were better trained, and Police receiving 
better training to avoid getting killed in the line of duty. These two responses must be classified in

23 
separate categories: (a) Better police training, general, and (b) Types of self-defense~safety 
techniques, respectively. 
Metonyms within content categories had to be manually classified, since such relations were often 
not derivable from real-world knowledge bases. For instance, in the training responses, A recent 
push in safety training has paid off for modern day police, and "Officers now better combat 
trained..., " the terms safety training with combat rained, needed to be related. Test developers had 
categorized both responses under the Trained for self-defense~safety ca egory. Safety training and 
combat train were terms related to a type of training with regard to personal safety. The terms had to 
be identified as metonyms in order to classify the responses accurately. 
4. Strategy for Representing Police Responses 
As previously mentioned, there was insufficient lexico-syntactic patterning to use a contextual word 
use method, and domain-specific word use could not be derived from real-world knowledge sources. 
Therefore, we developed a domain-specific concept lexicon based on a set of 200 training responses 
over all categories. Each single, relevant word or 2-3 word term was linked to a concept entry. 
Small concept grammars were developed for individual rubric categories. These grammars were 
based on the conceptual-structural representations identified in the training response set. 
As much as possible, it was important that the rules represented the relationship between multiple 
concepts within a phrasal constituent. The phrasal constituent itself, that is, whether it was an NP or 
a VP did not seem relevant. It was only meaningful that a constituent relationship occurred. Without 
this structural information, the concepts could occur in any position in a response, and automatic 
category assignment would not be reliable (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)). The procedure used to 
identify conceptual and syntactic information, retrieves concepts within specific phrasal and clausal 
categories. Once a response was processed, and concept ags were assigned, all phrasal and clausal 
categories were collapsed into a general phrasal category, XP, for the scoring process, as illustrated 
in (4), below. There were some cases, however, where we had no choice but to include some single 
concepts, due to the limited lexico-syntactic patterning in the data. 
4.1. The Scoring Lexicon for the Police Item 
What we term the scoring lexicon can best be illustrated by Bergler's (1995) layered lexicon. The 
underlying idea in Bergler's approach is that the lexicon has several ayers which are modular, and 
new layers can be plugged in for different texts. In this way, lexical entries can be linked 
appropriately to text-specific information. In the layered lexicon approach, words are linked to 
definitions within some hierarchy. Bergler's approach also has a meta-lexical layer which maps from 
syntactic patterns to semantic interpretation that does not affect the lexicon itself. By comparison, 
our scoring lexicon, contains a list of base word forms (i.e., concepts). 3 The definitions associated 
with these concepts were typically metonyms that were specific to the domain of the item. These 
metonym definitions were subordinate to the words they defined. In the spirit of the layered lexicon, 
the definitions associated with the superordinate concepts are modular, and can be changed given 
new domains. 
3Suffixation was removed so that part of speech did not interfere with conceptual generalizability. 
24 
For this study, metonyms for each concept were chosen from the entire set of single words over the 
whole training set, and specialized 2-word and 3-word terms (i.e., domain-specific and domain- 
independent idioms) which were found in the training data. The lexicon developed for this study was 
based on the training data from all rubric categories. In (2), below, a sample from the lexicon is 
given. Our concept grammars, described in Section 4.2, are in the spirit of Bergler's notion of a 
meta-lexical layer that provides a mapping between the syntax and semantics of individual responses. 
In our lexicon, concepts are preceded by #. Metonyms follow the concepts in a list. Lexical entries 
not preceded by # are relevant words from the set of training responses, which are metonyms of 
concepts. These entries will contain a pointer to a concept, indicated by '% <concept>'. A sample 
of the lexicon is illustrated below. 
(2) Sample from the Police Item Lexicon 
#BE'ITER \[ better good advance improve increase ... 
efficient modem well increase \]
ADVANCE \[ %better \]
4.2 Concept Grammar Rules for the Police Item 
The concept grammar rule templates for mapping and classifying responses were built from the 172 
training set responses in 32 categories. 4 The training data was parsed using the parser in Microsoft's 
Natural Language Processing Tool (see MS-NLP(1996) for a description of this tool). For this study, 
suffixes were removed by hand from the parsed data. Based on the syntactic parses of these 
responses and the lexicon, a small concept grammar was manually built for each category which 
characterized responses by concepts and relevant structural information. The phrasal constituents 
were unspecified. Sample concept grammar rules are illustrated in (3). 
(3) Sample Concept Grammar Rules for Types of self-defense/safety 
a. XP: \[POLICE\],XP: \[BETTER,TRAIN\],XP: \[SAFETY\] 
b. XP:\[TRAIN \],XP: \[POLICE,SAFETY\], 
XP:\[BE'VI'ER,SAFETY\] 
c. XP: \[POLICE,BE'VrER,TRAIN\], 
XP:\[SAFETY,DANGER,SITUATION\] 
d. XP:\[SPECIALIST\],XP:\[TRAIN SAFETY\] 
4.3 Processing Responses for Category Assignment 
Responses were, parsed, and then input into the phrasal node extraction program. The program 
extracted words and terms in Noun Phrases (NP), Verb Phrases (VP), Prepositional Phrases (PP), 
Infinitive Clauses (INFCL), Subordinate Clauses (SUBCL), Adjective Phrases (ADJP) and Adverb 
Phrases (ADVP). All phrasal and clausal constituent odes were then collapsed into a generalized

representation, XP. All single XPs and combinations of XPs were matched against he concept 
grammars for each content category to locate rule matches. This procedure is illustrated below.

b. Tag Phrasal Nodes of Parsed Response: 
\[Cops=POLICE\]NP 
\[better=BETTER,trained=TRAIN\]VP

c. Collapse Phrasal Nodes:

XP: \[better=BETTER,trained=TRAIN\] 
XP: \[self-defense=SAFETY\] 
d. Match Tagged Nodes to Concept Grammar Rules: 
XP: \[POLICE\], XP:\[BETTER,TRAIN\],XP:\[SAFETY\] 
4.4 Does Manual Preprocessing of the Data Outweigh the Benefits of Automated Scoring? 
Since the preprocessing of this response data is done by hand, the total person-time must be considered 
in relation to how long it would take test developers tohand score a data set in a real-world application. 
We must address the issue of whether or not a computer-based method would be efficient with regard to 
time and cost of scoring. 
In this study, the manual creation of the lexicon and the concept grammar rules for this data set took two 
people approximately one week, or 40 hours. Currently, we are developing a program to automate he 
generation of the concept grammars. We expect that once this program is in place, our preprocessing 
time will be cut in half. So, we estimate that it would take one person approximately 8 -10 hours to 
create the lexicon, and another 8 - 10 hours to do the preprocessing and post-processing required in 
conjunction with the automatic rule generation process currently being developed. 
The F-H item is currently only a pilot item for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), which 
administers approximately 28,000 examinees, yearly. For the F-H item, each examinee can give up to 15 
responses. So, the maximum number of responses for this item over the year would be approximately 
420,000. Each examinee's response set would then typically be scored by two human graders. It is 
difficult o estimate how long the manual scoring process would take in hours, but, presumably, it would 
take longer than the approximately 40hours it took to build the lexicon and concept grammars. 
Certainly, it would take longer than the 20 hours estimated, once the automatic rule generator is 
implemented. Therefore, assuming that the accuracy of this method could be improved satisfactorily, 
automated scoring would appear to be a viable cost-saving and time-saving option.

5.1 Initial Results 
One hundred and seventy-two responses were used for training. These responses were used to build 
the lexicon and the concept grammar rules. An additional, independent set of 206 test responses 
from 32 content categories was run through our prototype. The following were the results.

5.2 Error  Accountability 
Most of the errors made in classifying the data can be accounted for by four error types: (a) lexical 
gap, (b) human grader misclassification, (c) concept-structure problem, (d) cross-classification. The 
lexical gap error characterizes cases in which a response could not be classified because it was 
missing a concept ag, and, therefore, did not match a rule in the grammar. In reviewing the lexical 
gap errors, we found that the words not recognized by the system were metonyms that did not exist in 
the training, and were not identified as synonyms in any of our available thesaurus or on-line 
dictionary sources. For instance, in the response, "Police are better skilled...," the phrase better 
skilled, should be equated to better trained, but this could not be done based on the training 
responses, or dictionary sources. Forty percent of the errors were lexical gap errors. The second 
problem was human grader misclassification which accounted for ! percent of the errors. In these 
cases, it was clear that responses had been inadvertently misclassified, so the system either 
misclassified the response, also. For example, the response, Officers are better trained and more 
experienced so they can avoid dangerous ituations, was misclassified in Better trained police, 
general. It is almost identical to most of the responses in the category Better intervention~crook 
counseling. Our. system, therefore, classified the response in Better intervention~crook counseling. 
Concept-structure problems made up 30 percent of the errors. These were cases in which a response 
could not be classified because its concept-structural p tterning was different from all the concept 
grammar rules for all content categories. The fourth error type accounted for 17 percent of the cases 
in which there was significant conceptual similarity between two categories, such that categofial 
cross-classification ccurred. 
5.3 Additional Results Using an Augmented Lexicon 
As discussed above, 40 percent of the errors could be accounted for by lexical gaps. We 
hypothesized that our results would improve if more metonyms of existing concepts were added to 
the lexicon. Therefore, we augmented the lexicon with metonyms that could be accessed from the 
27 
test data. We reran the scoring program, using the augmented lexicon on the same set of data. The 
results of this run were the following.

The improvement which occurred by augmenting the lexicon further supports our procedure for 
classifying responses. Based on these results, we plan to explore ways to augment he lexicon 
without consulting the test set. Furthermore, we will use the augmented lexicon from this second 
experiment to score a set of 1200 new test data. 5
6. Conclusion 
Our results are encouraging and support the hypothesis that a lexical semantic approach can be 
usefully integrated into a system for scoring the free-response item described in this paper. 
Essentially, the results show that given a small set of data which is partitioned into several meaning 
classifications, core meaning can be identified by concept-structure patterns. It is crucial that a 
domain-specific lexicon is created to represent the concepts in the response set. Therefore, the 
concepts in the lexicon must denote metonyms which can be derived from the training set. Relevant 
synonyms of the metonyms can be added to expand the lexicon using dictionary and thesaurus 
sources. Using a layered lexicon approach (Bergler (1995)) allows the words in the lexicon to be 
maintained, while the part of the entry denoting domain-specific meaning is modular and can be 
replaced. The results of this case study illustrate that it is necessary to analyze content of responses 
based on the mapping between domain-specific concepts and the syntactic structure of a response. 
As mentioned earlier in the paper, previous systems did not score responses accurately due to an 
inability to reliably capture response paraphrases. These systems did not use structure or domain- 
specific lexicons in trying to analyze response content. The results show that the largest number of 
erroneous classifications occurred due to lexical gaps. Our second set of results shows that 
developing new methods to augment the lexicon would improve performance significantly. In future 
experiments, we plan to score an independent set of response data from the same item, using the 
augmented lexicon, to test the generalizability of our prototype. We realize that the results presented 
in this case study represent a relatively small data set. These results are encouraging, however, with 
regard to using a lexical semantics approach for automatic ontent identification on small data sets. 
5We did not use these 1200 test data in the initial study, since the set of 1200 has not been scored by test developers, 
so we could not measure agreement with regard to human scoring decisions. However, we believe that by using the 
augmented lexicon, and our concept grammars to automatically score the 1200 independent data, we can get a
