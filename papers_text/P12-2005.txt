Abstract
Some Statistical Machine Translation systems
never see the light because the owner of the
appropriate training data cannot release them,
and the potential user of the system cannot dis-
close what should be translated. We propose a
simple and practical encryption-based method
addressing this barrier.
1 Introduction
It is generally taken for granted that whoever is
deploying a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
system has unrestricted rights to access and use the
parallel data required for its training. This is not al-
ways the case. The ideal resources for training SMT
models are Translation Memories (TM), especially
when they are large, well maintained, coherent in
genre and topic and aligned with the application of
interest. Such TMs are cherished as valuable as-
sets by their owners, who rarely accept to give away
wholesale rights to their use. At the same time, the
prospective user of the SMT system that could be
derived from such TM might be subject to confiden-
tiality constraints on the text stream needing transla-
tion, so that sending out text to translate to an SMT
system deployed by the owner of the PT is not an
option.
We propose an encryption-based method that ad-
dresses such conflicting constraints. In this method,
the owner of the TM generates a Phrase Table (PT)
from it, and makes it accessible to the user following
a special procedure. An SMT decoder is deployed
by the user, with all the required resources to oper-
ate except the PT1.
As a result of following the proposed procedure:
? The user acquires all and only the phrase table
entries required to perform the decoding of a
specific file, thus avoiding complete transfer of
the TM to the user;
? The owner of the PT does not learn anything
about what is being translated, thus satisfying
the user?s confidentiality constraints;
? The owner of the PT can track the number of
phrase-table entries that was downloaded by
the user.
The method assumes that, besides the PT Owner
and the PT User, there is a Trusted Third Party. This
means that both the User and the PT owner trust such
third party not to collude with the other one for vi-
olating their secrets (i.e. the content of the PT, or a
string requiring translation), even if they do not trust
her enough to directly disclose such secrets to her.
While the exposition will focus on phrase tables,
there is nothing in the method precluding its use with
other resources, provided that they can be repre-
sented as look-up tables, a very mild constraint. Pro-
vided speed-related aspects can be dealt with, this
makes the method directly applicable to language
models, or distortion tables for models with lexi-
calized distortion (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006).
The method is also directly applicable to Transla-
tion Memories, which can be seen as ?degenerate?
1If the decoder can operate with multiple PTs, then there
could be other (possibly out-of-domain) PTs installed locally.

phrase tables where each record contains only a
translation in the target language, and no associated
statistics.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 explains the proposed method; in Section 3 we
make more precise some implementation choices.
We briefly touch on related work on Section 4, pro-
vide an experimental validation in Sec. 5, and offer
some concluding remarks in Sec. 6.
2 Private access to phrase tables
Let Alice2 be the owner of a PT, Bob the owner of
the SMT decoder who would like to use the table,
and Tina a trusted third-party. In broad terms, the
proposed method works like this: in an initializa-
tion phase, Alice first encrypts PT entries one by
one, sends the encrypted PT to Bob, and the en-
cryption/decryption keys to Tina. Alice also sends
a method to map source language phrases to PT in-
dices to Bob.
When translating, Bob uses the mapping method
sent by Alice to check if a given source phrase is
present and has a translation in the PT and, if this is
the case, retrieves the index of the corresponding en-
try in the PT. If the check is positive, then Bob sends
a request to Tina for the corresponding decryption
key. Tina delivers the decryption key to Bob and
communicates that a download has taken place to
Alice, who can then increase a download counter.
Let {(s1, v1), . . . , (sn, vn)} be a PT, where si is
a source phrase and vi is the corresponding record.
In an actual PT there are multiple lines for a same
source phrase, but it is always possible to reconstruct
a single record by concatenating all such lines.
2.1 Initialization
The initialization phase is illustrated in Fig. 1. For
each PT entry (si, vi), Alice:
1. Encrypts vi with key ki We denote the en-
crypted record as vi ? ki
2. Computes a digest di of the source entry si
3. Sends the phrase digests {di}i=1,...,n to Bob
2We adopt a widespread convention in cryptography and as-
sign person names to the parties involved in the exchange.

entries and the corresponding source phrase digests. Tina

{vi ? ki}i=1,...,n to Bob
5. Sends the keys {ki}i=1,...,n to Tina
A digest, or one-way hash function (Schneider,
1996), is a particular type of hash function. It takes
as input a string of arbitrary length, and determin-
istically produces a bit string of fixed length. It is
such that it is virtually impossible to reconstruct a
message given its digest, and that the probability of
collisions, i.e. of two strings being given the same
digest, is negligible.
At the end of the initialization, neither Bob nor
Tina can access the content of the PT, unless they
collude.
2.2 Retrieval
During translation, Bob has a source phrase s and
would like to retrieve from the PT the corresponding
entry, if it is present. To do so (Fig. 2):
1. Bob computes the digest d of s using the same
cryptographic hash function used by Alice in
the initialization phase;
2. Bob checks whether d ? {di}i=1,...,n. If the
check is negative then s does not have an entry
in the PT, and the process stops. If the check is
positive then s has an entry in the PT: let is be
the corresponding index;

3. Bob requests to Tina key kis ;
4. Tina sends Bob kis and notifies Alice, who can
increment a counter of PT entries downloaded
by Bob;
5. Bob decrypts vis ? kis using key kis , and re-
covers vis .
At the end of the process, Bob retrieved from the
PT owned by Alice an entry if and only if it matched
phrase s (this is guaranteed by the virtual absence of
collisions ensured by the cryptographic hash func-
tions used for computing phrase digests). Alice was
notified by Tina that Bob downloaded one entry, as
desired, while neither Tina nor Alice could learn s,
unless they colluded.
3 Implementation
For clarity of exposition, in Section 2.2 we presented
a method for looking up PT entries involving one in-
teraction for each phrase look-up. In our implemen-
tation, we batch all requests for all source phrases
up to a predefined length for all sentences in a given
file. This mirrors the standard practice of filtering
the phrase table for a given source file to translate
before starting the actual decoding.
Out of the large choice of cryptographic hash
functions in the literature (Schneider, 1996), we
chose 128 bits md5 for its widespread availability in
multiple programming languages and environments.
For encrypting entries, we used bit-wise XOR
with a string of random bits (the key) of the same
length as the encrypted item. This symmetric en-
cryption is known as one-time pad, and it is unbreak-
able, provided key bits are really random.
Both keys and ciphertext are indexed and sorted
by increasing md5 digest of the corresponding
source phrase. For retrieving all entries matching
a given text file, Bob generates md5 digests for all
source phrases up to a maximum length, sorts them,
and performs a join with the encrypted entry file.
Matching digests are then sent to Tina for her to join
with the keys. It is important that Bob uses the same
tokenizer/word segmentation scheme used by Alice
in preprocessing training data before extracting the
PT.
Note that it is never necessary to have any massive
data structure in main memory, and all process steps
except the initial sorting by md5 digest are linear in
the number of PT entries or in the number of tokens
to look up. The process results however in increased
storage and bandwidth requirements, since cipher-
text and key have each roughly the same size as the
original PT.
4 Related work
We are not aware of any previous work directly ad-
dressing the problem we solve, i.e. private access
to a phrase table or other resources for the pur-
pose of performing statistical machine translation.
Private access to electronic information in general,
however, is an active research area. While effec-
tive, the scheme proposed here is rather basic, com-
pared to what can be found in specialized literature,
e.g. (Chor et al, 1998; Bellovin and Cheswick,
2004). An interesting and relatively recent sur-
vey of the field of secure multiparty computation
and privacy-preserving data mining is (Lindell and
Pinkas, 2009).
5 Experiments
We validated our simple implementation using a
phrase table of 38,488,777 lines created with the
Moses toolkit3(Koehn et al, 2007) phrase-based
SMT system, corresponding to 15,764,069 entries
for distinct source phrases4.

lision probability of 10?18 is around 2.6 ? 1010. This means

Figure 3: Time required to complete the initialization as
a function of the number of lines in the original PT.
This PT was obtained processing the training data
of the English-Spanish Europarl corpus used in the
WMT 2008 shared task5. We used a 2,000 sentence
test set of the same shared evaluation for experi-
menting with the querying phase.
We conducted all experiments on a single core of
an ordinary Linux server6 with 32Gb of RAM. Both
initialization and retrieval can be easily parallelized.
Figure 3 shows the time required to complete the
initialization phase as a function of the size of the
original PT (in million of lines). The progression
is largely linear, and the overall initialization time
of roughly 45 minutes for the complete PT indicates
that the method can be used in practice. Note that
the Europarl corpus originating the phrase-table is
much larger than most TMs available at even large
language service providers.
Figure 4 displays the time required to complete
retrieval for subsets of increasing size of the 2,000
sentence test set, and for phrase tables uniformly
sampled at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. 217,019
distinct digests are generated for all possible phrase
of length up to 6 from the full test set, resulting in
the retrieval of 47,072 entries (596,560 lines) from
the full phrase table. Our implementation of the re-
trieval uses the Unix join command on the ciphertext
and the key tables, and performs a full scan through
that if the hash distributed keys perfectly uniformly, then about
26 billion entries would be required for the collision probabil-
ity to exceed 10?18. While no hash function, including md5,
distributes keys perfectly evenly (Bellare and Kohno, 2004), the
number of entries likely to be handled in our application is or-
ders of magnitude smaller than the bound.

those files. Complexity hence depends more on the
size of the PT than on the length of the query. An
ad-hoc indexing of the encrypted entries and of the
keys in e.g. a standard database would make the
dependency logarithmic in the number of entries,
and linear in the number of source tokens. Digests?
prefixes are perfectly suited for bucketing ciphertext
and keys. This would be useful if query batches are
small.
6 Conclusions
Some SMT systems never get deployed because
of legitimate and incompatible concerns of the
prospective users and of the training data owners.
We propose a method that guarantees to the owner of
a TM that only some fraction of an artifact derived
from the original resource, a phrase-table, is trans-
ferred, and only in a very controlled way allowing
to track downloads. This same method also guaran-
tees the privacy of the user, who is not required to
disclose the content of what needs translation.
Empirical validation on demanding conditions
shows that the proposed method is practical on or-
dinary computing infrastructure.
This same method can be easily extended to other
resources used by SMT systems, and indeed even
beyond SMT itself, whenever similar constraints on
data access exist.
