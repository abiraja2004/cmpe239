ABSTRACT 
Performance estimates given for speech recognition/understanding 
systems are typically based on the assumption that users will behave in 
ways similar to the observed behavior of laboratory volunteers. This 
includes the acoustic/phonetic characteristics of the spcech they produce as 
well as their willingness and ability to constrain their input o the device 
according to instructions. Since speech recognition devices often do not 
perform as well in the field as they do in the laboratory, analyses of real 
user behavior have been undertaken. The results of several field trials 
suggest that real user compliance with instructions is dramatically affected 
by the particular details of the prompts supplied to the user. A significant 
amount of real user speech data has been collected uring these trials 
(34,000 uuerances, 29hours of data). These speech databases are described 
along with the results of an experiment comparing the performance of a 
speech recognition system on real user vs. laboratory speech. 
INTRODUCTION 
Speech recognition/understanding systems will ultimately 
establish their usefulness by working well under eal application 
conditions. Success in the field will depend not only on the 
technology itself but also on the behavior of real users. Real user 
behavior can be characterized interms of 1. what people say and 2. 
how they say it. 
What people say: Real user compliance 
Until the advent of a high performance continuous speech, 
unconstrained vocabulary/grammar, interactive speech 
understanding system, users must constrain their spoken 
interactions with speech recognition/understanding systems. 
Constraints may require speaking words in isolation, conforming 
to a limited vocabulary or grammar, restricting queries to a 
particular knowledge domain, etc. The users' willingness to 
comply with instructions pecifying these constraints will 
determine the success of the technology. If users are willing or 
even able to confine themselves toone of two words (e.g., yes or 
no), a two-word speech recognition system may succeed. If users 
are non-compliant (e.g., say the target words embedded inphrases, 
say synonyms of the target words, reject he service as a result of 
the constraining instructions), the technology will fail in the field; 
despite high accuracy laboratory performance. 
How compliant are real users? The answer may be application- 
specific, dependent on particulars such as 1. frequency of repeat 
usage of the system, 2. motivation of the users, 3. cost of an error, 
4. nature of the constraint, etc. It would be useful to understand the 
factors that predict compliance, and to know whether 
generalizations can be made across applications. In addition, it 
would be useful to have a better understanding of how to maximize 
user compliance. 
Moreover, there is value in analyzing non-compliant behavior. 
To the extent hat non-compliance takes the form of choosing 
synonyms of the target words, the recognizer's vocabulary must be 
expanded. If non-compliance takes the form of embedding the target 
word in a phrase, word spotting or continuous speech recognition 
is required. If non-compliance is manifested by the user 
consistently wandering outside the knowledge domain of the speech 
recognition/understanding system, better instructions may be 
required. Data from real users should provide researchers and 
developers with the information ecessary to both specify and 
develop the technology required for successful deployment of
speech recognition/understanding systems. 
How people speak: Real user speech 
It seems intuitively obvious that to maximize the probability 
of successfully automating an application with speech recognition, 
a recognizer should be trained and tested on real user speech. This 
requires the collection of data from casual users interacting with an 
automated or pseudo-automated system, thereby producing 
spontaneous goal-directed speech under application conditions. 
These databases can be difficult and expensive tocollect and so it is 
not surprising that speech recognition systems are most typically 
trained and tested on speech data collected under laboratory 
conditions. Laboratory databases can be gathered relatively quickly 
and inexpensively b  recording speech produced by cooperative 
volunteers who are aware that they are participating in a data 
collection exercise. But these databases typically have relatively 
few talkers and speech that is recited rather than spontaneously- 
produced. 
Potential differences between real user and laboratory speech 
databases would be of little interest if speech recognition systems 
were performing as well in field applications as they are in the 
laboratory. However, there is data to suggest that this is not the 
case; systems performing well in the laboratory often achieve 
significantly poorer esults when confronted with real user data 
\[1,2\]. 
A number of features that differentiate r al user from laboratory 
database collection procedures may have an impact on the 
performance of speech recognition systems. One that has received 
specific attention i the literature is that of spontaneously-produced 
vs. read speech. Jelinek et al \[3\] compared the performance of a 
speech recognition system when tested on pre-recorded, read and 
spontaneous speech produced by five talkers. Results indicate 
decreasing performance for the three sets of test material (98.0%, 
96.9% and 94.3% correct, respectively). Rudnicky et al \[4\] 
evaluated their speech recognition system on both read and 
spontaneous speech produced by four talkers and found that 
performance was roughly equal for the two data sets (94.0% vs. 
94.9% correct, respectively). It is important to note, however, that 
the spontaneous speech used for this comparison was "live clean 
164 
speech" defined as "only those utterances that both contain o 
interjected material (e.g., audible non-speech) and that are 
grammatical". Degradation i performance was indeed seen when 
the test set included all of the "live speech" (92.7%). Zue etal. \[5\] 
also evaluated their speech recognition system on read and 
spontaneous speech samples. Word and sentence accuracy were 
similar for the two data sets. For each of these studies, 'real user' 
speech samples were recorded under wideband application-like 
conditions. For at least wo of the studies (\[4\], \[5\]), the 'real users' 
were apparently aware that they were participating in an 
experiment. 
It has not been possible to collect databases that are matched 
with respect to speakers for telephone speech, probably because the 
anonymity of the users of telephone services makes it difficult o 
obtain read versions of spontaneously-produced sp ech from the 
same set of talkers. Therefore, there is little published ata on the 
effects of read vs. spontaneous speech on the performance of
recognition systems for telephone applications. Differences in 
speakers not withstanding, there is recent data to suggest hat 
recognition performance an be significantly poorer when testing 
on real user telephone speech as compared to tests using telephone 
speech collected under laboratory conditions (\[1\], \[2\]). 
In summary, laboratory and real user behavior can be 
characterized along at least wo important dimensions: compliance 
and speech characteristics. To gain a better understanding of how to 
improve the field performance of speech recognition/understanding 
systems, we have been collecting and analyzing both laboratory 
and real user data. The goal of this paper is to summarize our 
work in the analysis of 1. real user compliance for telephone 
applications and 2. laboratory vs. real user speech data for the 
development of speech recognition/understanding systems. 
REAL USER DATABASE COLLECTION 
PROCEDURES 
Three real user telephone speech databases have been collected 
by pseudo-automating telephone operator functions and digitally 
recording the speech produced by users as they interacted with the 
services. In each case, experimental equipment was attached to a 
traditional telephone operator workstation and was capable of : 1. 
automatically detecting the presence of a call, 2. playing one of a 
set of pre-recorded prompts to the user, 3. recording user speech, 4. 
automatically detecting a user hang-up and 5. storing data about 
call conditions associated with a given speech file (e.g., time of 
day, prompt condition, etc.). The three operator services under 
study were 1. Intercept Services (IS) 2. Directory Assistance Call 
Completion (DACC) and 3. Directory Assistance (DA). In addition 
to collecting data for several automated dialogues, recordings were 
made of traditional 'operator-handled' calls for the services under 
investigation. 
Each of these databases was collected in a real serviee-providing 
environment. That is, users were unaware that they were 
participating in an experiment. The identity of the speakers was 
not known, so a precise description of dialectal distribution is
difficult. Calls reached the trial position through random 
assignment of calls to operator positions, a task performed by a 
network component known as an Automatic Call Distributor 
(ACD). Therefore, for each of the databases, it is assumed that he 
number of utterances corresponds tothe number of speakers. We 
have so far collected nearly 29 hours of real user speech: 34,000 
utterances (presumably from that many different speakers). 
REAL USER COMPLIANCE 
For the IS trial, users were asked what telephone number they 
had just dialed. For the DACC trial, users were asked to accept or 
reject he call completion service. For the DA trial, users were 
asked for the city name corresponding to their directory request. 
The 'target' responses, therefore, were digit strings, yes/no 
responses and isolated city names, respectively. Users were 
presented with different automated prompts varying along a number 
of dimensions. Their responses were analyzed to determine the 
effects of dialogue condition on real user compliance (frequency 
with which users provided the target response). 
Intercept Services: 'Simple' Digit Recognition 
One problem with digit recognition is that users may say more 
than just digits. The target response for the IS trial was a digit 
string. The automated prompts to the users varied with respect to 
the 1. presence/absence of an introductory greeting which informed 
users that hey were interacting with an automated system 2. speed 
with which the prompts were spoken (fast, slow), and 3. the 
explicitness of the prompts (wordy, concise). In addition, data were 
recorded under an operator-handled condition. During operator- 
handled intercept calls, operators ask users, "What number did you 
dial?". 
A total of 3794 utterances were recorded: 2223 were in the 
automated-prompt conditions and 1571 were in the operator-handled 
condition. 'Non-target' words were defined as anything other than 
the digits '0' through '9' and the word 'oh'. Results showed that 
only 13.6% of the utterances in the automated conditions were 
classified as non-target, while 40.6% of the utterances in the 
operator-handled condition fell into the non-target category. 
Non-target utterances were further classified as '100-type' 
utterances (that is, utterances inwhich the user said the digit string 
as "992-4-one-hundred, tc.) and 'extra verbiage' utterances (that is, 
utterances in which the user said more than just the digit string 
such as, "I think the number is ...", or "oh, urn, 992 ..."). For 
both automated and operator-handled calls, users produce more extra 
verbiage utterances than 100-type utterances. Both types of non- 
target responses occurred more than twice as often in the operator- 
handled condition compared to the automated conditions. 
The speed and wordiness of the automated prompts did not 
affect user compliance. However, contrary to our expectations, the 
data suggest hat the proportion of non-target responses is 
substantially reduced when the user is not given an introductory 
greeting which explains the automated service (19.2% vs. 4.9% 
non-target responses for the greeting vs. no-greeting conditions, 
respectively). Instead, giving users an immediate directive to say 
the dialed number results in the highest proportion of responses 
which are restricted to the desired vocabulary. It appears that even 
untrained users are immediately attuned to the fact that they are 
interacting with an automated service and modify their instinctual 
response in ways beneficial to speech recognition automation. At
least for this application, brevity is best. For more information on 
this trial, see \[6\]. 
D i rec tory  Ass i s tance  Ca l l  Complet ion :  Yes /No  
Recognition 
The target response for the DACC trial was an isolated 'yes' or 
'no' response. Successful recognition of these words would have 
many applications, but the problem for a two-word recognizer is
165 
that users sometimes say more than the desired two words. Data 
were collected under fl~ree automated prompt conditions and one 
operator-lmndled condition. The operator asked, ?Would you like us 
to automatically dial that call for an additional charge of__ cents?" 
The three automated prompts were as follows: 1. a recorded version 
of the operator prompt 2. a prompt which explicitly asked for a 
'yes' or 'no' response and 3. a oromot hat asked for a 'yes' or hang 
up response. 
A total of 3394 responses were recorded; 1781 were operator- 
handled calls, while 1613 were calls handled by automated 
prompts. Figure 1 shows the percentage of 'yes' responses among 
the affirmative responses as a function of dialogue condition. 
Results again indicate that variations in the prompt can have a 
sizable ffect on user compliance and that there are considerable 
differences between user behavior with a human operator vs. an 
automated system.

Table 1: Percentage of users' affirmative responses as a function

The operator-handled condition exhibited the greatest range of 
variability, with 53% of the affirmative responses falling into the 
'other' category. For more information on the DACC trial, see \[7\], 
"Directory assistance, what city please?" 
The target response for the Directory Assistance trial was an 
isolated city name. Data were collected under four automated 
prompt conditions and one operator-handled condition. Directory 
Assistance operators typically ask users "What city, please?". One 
automated prompt used the same wording as the operator; the other 
three were worded to encourage users to say an isolated city name. 
Recording was initiated automatically at the offset of a beep tone 
that prompted users to respond. Recording was terminated by a 
human observer who determined that the user had finished 
responding tothe automated request for information. 
A total of 26,946 utterances were collected under automated 
conditions. Operator-handled calls were collected uring a separate 
trial \[8\] and only 100 of these utterances were available for 
analysis. Figure 2 shows the percentage of target responses as a 
function of dialogue condition.

Figure 2: Percentage of all responses that were isolated city 
names as a function of dialogue condition. 
As in the other two trials, user behavior was quite different for 
operator-handled vs. automated calls. On average, users were 
almost four times more likely to say an isolated city name in 
response to an automated prompt than to an operator query. 
Moreover, the wording of the automated prompt had a large effect 
on user compliance. Superficially minor variations in prompt 
wording increased user compliance by a factor of four (15.0% vs. 
64.0% compfiance for prompt 1 vs. 4, respectively). 
Very few users either did not reply or replied without a city 
name in response to an operator prompt. For the automated 
conditions, between 14% and 23% of the users simply did not 
respond. Between 3% and 23% responded without including acity 
name. To interpret these results, we point out that in contrast to 
the users oflS and DACC services, Directory Assistance users tend 
to be repeat callers with well-rehearsed scripts in mind. When the 
familiar interaction is unexpectedly disrupted, some of these users 
appear to be unsure of how to respond. 
Of particular interest was the effect of dialogue condition on the 
frequency of occurrence of city names embedded in longer 
utterances. These results appear in Figure 3.

It is clear that embedded responses are most ypical during user- 
operator interactions. To allow for this response mode, a recognizer 
would have to be able to 'find' the city name in such utterances. 
This could be accomplished with a word spotting system or with a 
continuous speech recognition/understanding system. To consider 
the difficulty of the former, embedded city name responses were 
further categorized as simple vs. complex; assuming that the 
former would be relatively easy to 'spot'. A 'simple' embedded city 
name was operationally defined as a city name surrounded by 
approximately one word (for example, "Boston, please", "urn, 
Boston", "Boston, thank you"). The proportion of embedded 
utterances classified as 'simple' as a function of prompt is shown 
in Figure 4.

It is interesting tonote that prompts 3 and 4, which elicited the 
highest proportion of isolated city names, also elicited a higher 
proportion of 'simple' embedded city names. It seems that users 
interpreted prompts 3 and 4 as the most constraining, even when 
they did not fully comply. 
DISCUSSION 
The results of this series of experiments on real user 
compliance suggest that this aspect of user behavior is 
significantly different when interacting with a live operator than 
when interacting with an automated system. The lesson is that 
feasibility projections made on the basis of observing operator- 
handled transactions will significantly underestimate automation 
potential. In addition, the precise wording of the prompts used in a 
speech recognition/understanding application significantly affects 
user compliance and therefore the likelihood of recognition success. 
Users seem to know immediately that they are interacting with an 
automated service and explicitly infotraing them of this fact does 
not improve (in fact, decreases) user compliance. Prompts hould 
be brief and the tasks should not be too unnatural. Although not 
discussed above; informal analysis of the data suggests that very 
few users attempted to interrupt the prompts with their verbal 
responses. While this would suggest that 'barge-in' technology is
not a high priority, it should be noted that the users under 
investigation were all first-time users of the automated service. It 
seems likely that their desire to interrupt the prompt will increase 
with experience, as has been found for Touch-Tone applications. 
Although each of the applications under investigation was 
different with respect to the degree of repeat usage, the motivation 
of the user, the cost of an error, etc., the trials were similar in that 
there was no opportunity for learning on the part of the user. This 
is an important factor in the success of many speech 
recognition/understanding systems and is an area of future research 
for the group. 
LABORATORY DATABASE COLLECTION 
PROCEDURES 
While real user speech databases provide value to the 
researcher/developer, they present limitations as well. Most 
notably, the a priori probabilities for the vocabulary items under 
investigation are typically quite skewed. It is rare, in a real 
application, that any one user response is as likely as any other. 
The DA data collection gathered almost 27,000 utterances, yet 
there are less than 10 instances of particular cities and, 
correspondingly, less than 10 exemplars of certain phones. If these 
data are to be used for training speech recognition/understanding 
systems, they must be supplemented with laboratory data? To this 
end, as well as for the purposes of comparing real user to 
laboratory data, application-specific and standardized laboratory 
telephone speech data collection efforts were undertaken. 
Application-specific laboratory speech 
database collection 
A laboratory city name database was collected by having 
volunteers call a New York-based laboratory from their New 
England-based home or office telephones. Talkers were originally 
from the New England area and so were assumed to be familiar 
with the pronunciation f the target city names. 
When a speaker called, the system asked him/her to speak the 
city names, waiting for a prompt before saying the next city name 
(the order of the city names was randomized soas to minimize list 
effects). 10,900 utterances from over 400 speakers have been 
collected in this way. 
This kind of database provides ome of the characteristics of a 
real user database (a sample of telephone network connections and 
167 
telephone sets). The speech, however, is read rather than 
spontaneously-produced and the speakers are aware that they are 
participating in a data collection exercise. This database has been 
compared to the DA corpus just described. Results are reported 
below. 
Standardized telephone speech data collection 
The TIM1T database r flects the general nature of speech and is 
not designed for any particular application \[10\]. It is well known 
that the telephone network creates both linear and nonlinear 
distortions of the speech signal during transmission. In the 
development of a telephone speech recognition/understanding 
system, it is desirable to have a database with the advantages of the 
TIMIT database, coupled with the effects introduced by the 
telephone network. Towards this end, a data collection system has 
been developed tocreate a telephone network version of the TIM1T 
database (as well as other standardized wideband speech databases). 
The system is capable of 1. systematically controlling the 
telephone network and 2. retaining the original time-aligned 
phonetic transcriptions. 
Figure 5 shows the hardware configuration used in the 
collection of the NTIMIT (Network TIM1T) database. The TIMIT 
utterance is transmitted in an acoustically isolated room through an 
artificial mouth. A telephone handset is held by a telephone test 
frame mounting device. Taken together, this equipment isdesigned 
to approximate he acoustic oupling between the human mouth 
and the telephone handset. To allow transmission of utterances to
various locations, "loopback" devices in remote central offices 
were used.

The choice of where to send the ~ utterances was carefully 
designed to ensure geographic coverage as well as to keep the 
distribution of speaker gender and dialect for each geographic area 
roughly equivalent to the distribution i the entire TIMIT database. 
To obtain information about ransmission characteristics such as 
frequency response, loss, etc., two calibration signals (sweep 
frequency and 1000 Hz pure tone signals) were sent along with the 
TIMIT utterances. NTIM1T utterances were automatically aligned 
with the original TIM1T transcriptions. 
The NTIMIT database is currently being used to train a 
telephone network speech recognition system. Performance will be 
compared to that of a system trained on a band-limited version of 
the TIMIT database to determine the effects of a 'real' vs. simulated 
telephone network on recognition results. In addition, we are 
evaluating the performance of a recognizer trained on a 
combination of material from real user speech databases and 
NTIM1T. 
For more information on NTIMIT, see \[9\]. The NTIMIT 
database is being prepared for public distribution through NIST. 
LABORATORY VS.  REAL  USER SPEECH 
FOR TRAIN ING AND TEST ING SPEECH 
RECOGNIT ION SYSTEMS 
The laboratory and real user city name databases described 
above allowed us to evaluate the performance of a speaker 
independent, isolated word, telephone network speech recognition 
system when tested on laboratory vs. real user data. Two training 
scenarios were included: 1. trained on laboratory data and 2. trained 
on real user data. To equate the number of training and testing 
samples for each of the 15 city names under investigation, only a 
subset of each database was used (and only isolated city names were 
used from the real user database). 
Each database was divided into a training and testing set, 
consisting of 90% and 10% of the databases, respectively. A 
phonetically-based speaker independent isolated word telephone 
network speech recognition system was used for this experiment. 
The recognizer, developed as part of an MIT-NYNEX joint 
development project, was built upon a system developed at MIT 
(for more details on the MIT recognizer, see \[11\]). The system was 
trained on each training set and then tested on each testing set. This 
resulted in four training/testing conditions. 
Results revealed that performance hanged little as a function of 
laboratory vs. user training databases when tested on laboratory 
speech (95.9% vs. 91.1% for laboratory and user training 
databases, respectively). In contrast, performance changed 
dramatically as a function of training database when tested on real 
user speech (52.0% vs. 87.7% for laboratory and user training 
databases, respectively). Two points of interest here are: 1. The 
recognizer that was trained and tested on laboratory speech 
performed almost 9% better than the recognizer t ained and tested 
on real user speech (95.9% vs. 87.7% respectively). Apparently, 
recognizing real user speech is an inherently more difficult 
problem. 2. Performance of the laboratory-trained system on real 
user speech was 43.9% poorer than the same system tested on 
laboratory speech. A number of experiments were conducted to 
better understand these results. 
It is assumed that the performance of the real user-trained 
system on real user speech (87.7%) represents optimal 
performance. Therefore, the performance discrepancy tobe explored 
is the difference between 52.0% (the lab-trained system on real user 
speech) and 87.7%. Each one of the recognizer's components 
involved in the training was considered for analysis. This included 
1. phonetic acoustic models, 2. silence acoustic models 3. lexical 
transition weights and 4. lexieal arc deletion weights. A series of 
experiments were done in which each of these components from 
the real user-trained recognizer was systematically substituted for 
its counterpart in the laboratory-trained r cognizer. The resulting 
hybrid recognizer was evaluated ateach stage. 
Results revealed that an overwhelming majority of the 
performance difference could be accounted for by the acoustic 
models for silence. A recognizer t ained on laboratory speech which 
used silence acoustic models trained on real user speech achieved 
82% accuracy when tested on real user speech. An acoustic 
analysis of the two databases revealed that they were quite similar 
with respect o the frequency characteristics of the non-speech 
portions of the signal and the signal-to-noise ratios. Rather, it was 
168 
the mean duration and variability in duration of the non-speech 
signal prior to the onset of the speech that accounts for this effect. 
It is important to note that the silence surrounding the laboratory- 
collected city names was artificially controlled by both the data 
collection procedures (talkers knew they had only a limited amount 
of time to speak before hearing the prompt o read the next city 
name) and subsequent hand editing. The real user data were not 
since a field recognizer will not see controlled or hand edited ata. 
While these results may appear to be artifactual, they point out the 
limitations imposed on the researcher/developer in only being 
exposed to laboratory data. Further experimentation revealed that 
using real user-trained phonetic acoustic models accounts for most 
of the remaining 6%, with decreasing importance attributable to
real user-trained lexical transition weights and real user-trained 
lexical arc deletion weights. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The longer term goal of the work summarized above is to 
develop speech recognition/understanding systems that maintain 
high accuracy performance in real telephone applications. 
Comparisons between a real user and a laboratory speech 
database highlight how apparently superficial differences between 
the two database types can result in dramatic differences in 
recognition performance. Having accounted for this kind of effect, 
there appears to be an approximately 6% performance difference 
that can be attributed todifferences in the speech signal itself, even 
for a small vocabulary isolated-word ecognition task. This is the 
subject of further investigation. The differences reported in the 
literature when comparing laboratory to field performance for 
continuous peech recognition typically exceeds 6% (\[1\], \[2\]). It
seems likely that differences between read and spontaneous speech 
are minimized in the production of isolated words. Future research 
will include continued study of the differences between real user and 
laboratory speech and its effects on recognition/understanding 
performance for a continuous speech task.
