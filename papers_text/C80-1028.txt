Summar L 
In this paper the methodological ba- 
sis of the 'computational linguistics ap- 
proach' for representing the meaning of 
natural language sentences is investiga- 
ted. Its adherance to principles of for- 
mal linguistics and formal philosophy of 
language like the 'separation of levels 
of syntactic and semantic analysis', and 
the "Fregean" principle may be contrast- 
ed with the 'artificial intell igence ap- 
proach'. A "Montague" style method of 
mapping the syntax of natural language 
onto the syntax of the 'semantic lan- 
guage' used as the means of internal re- 
presentation in the information system 
PLIDIS is presented. Rules for defining 
subsequent levels of representation like 
'syntax-interpretative level', 'redundancy' 
free level' are given. 
Introduction 
The present paper presents ideas 
concerning a methodology of the 'seman- 
tics in computational linguistics' (COL- 
semantics). 
There is the following hypothesis 
underlying: 
In the field of COL-semantics algo- 
rithms and computer programs are devel- 
oped which deliver structures of lingui- 
stic analysis and representation that 
can be compared with those of formal lin- 
guistic semantics and satisfy the ade- 
quacy criteria of certain linguistic the- 
ories. They therefore are suitable in- 
struments for developing and testing such 
theories. 
COL-semantics hence proceeds in a 
way different from the semantic process- 
ing as it is found in the framework of 
artificial intell igence (AI-semantics). 
AI-semantics is not so much linked to 
the semantics of formal linguistics or 
logic but rather to cognitive psycholo- 
gy, problem solving theory and the the- 
ory of knowledge representation which has 
been recently put forward within AI it- 
self. 1 Between both branches of semantic 
processing of natural language that are 
realized in computer systems there there- 
fore exists a difference in aims, the- 
ories and methods. 
Starting from a brief sketch ot the 
aims and theories of both approaches one 
essential methodological principle of 
COL-semantics will be elaborated in the 
second chapter of the paper. In the third 
chapter COL-semantic methods will be ex- 
emplif ied by a concrete application, the 
production of semantic representations in 
an information system. Stress will notbe 
laid on the question of w h a t a COL- 
semantic representation should look like 
but  h o w leve ls  o f  a semant ic  represen-  
ta t ion  can be sys temat ica l ly  re la tedwi th  
natura l  language and w i th  each o ther .

Thus the  A I -approach  leads  to a the -  
o ry  where  the  ob jec t  o f  exp lanat ion  (o r  
s imu lat ion)  i s  " ra t iona l  human behav iour  ''2 
or  more spec i f i ca l ly  human language be-  
haviour as a rational psychic process, 
whereas in the theory of linguistic se- 
mantics language is being objectif ied as 
a generated structure or a system which 
can be considered independently from the 
associated mental processes. In lingui- 
stic semantics and also in COL-semantics 
meta-l inguistic notions which refer to 
language as a system like 'synonymy', 
'equivalence' and (particularly in the 
formal linguistics based on logic)'truth' 
and 'entailment' are crucial; in AI-se- 
mantics however we have the 'behaviour' 
oriented conce~ts of ' inferencing','dis- 
ambiguating', "reasoning', 'planning' 
etc o 
A methodological principle of 
COL-semantics 
A distinctive feature of lingui- 
stics, especially logico-l inguistic the- 
ories, is the separation of different 
"expression" and "content" levels of ana- 
lysis and representation and the speci- 
-202 
fication of mapping rules between them 
(surface structure versus deep structure, 
syntactic structure versus semantic struc- 
ture). In Montague grammar this differen- 
tiation between a well defined syntactic 
level and an also well defined semantic 
level of description is a methodological- 
ly necessary consequence of the "Fregean" 
principle. The Fregean principle states 
that the meaning of an expression can be 
determined on the basis of the meanings 
of its logically simple constituent ex- 
pressions and the syntactic structure of 
the whole expression. This principle has 
been revived by Montague and has ~eenre-  
alized in his theory of language in such 
a way that the syntactic and the seman- 
tic structure of a natural language ex- 
pression are respectively represented as 
expressions of formal systems (syntax and 
meaning algebras) between which systems 
there exist well defined formal relation- 
ships (homomorphisms). 
When this concept is transferred to 
the operationalizing of l inguistic analy- 
sis in a computer system it will be ex- 
cluded to conceive the mapping from nat- 
ural language into semantic representa- 
tion as a simple integrated pass, where 
in the course of parsing a sentence the 
valid semantic interpretation is assigned 
to each occurring item or group of items 
and where the possibil it ies of inference 
and association with stored background 
knowledge are flocally f realized without 
ever generating a full syntactic analysis. 
Saving an explicit level of syntactic re- 
presentation seems to be compatible with 
the Fregean principle only under the con- 
dition that the algorithm incorporates a 
grammar (in the technical sense of a con- 
sistent set of generating or accepting 
syntactic rules), but for reasons of op- 
timization directly associates or applies 
semantic 'values' or 'rules' in process- 
ing the corresponding syntactic 'nodes' 
or 'rules '4, or even allows a semantic 
control of rule selection without leaving 
the parsing mode. This condition however 
is mostly not maintained in AI parsing ap- 
proaches where the one step processing is 
understood as a cognitively adequate ana- 
logue of human linguistic information pro- 
cessing and where even the terminal and 
non terminal symbols of the "grammar" are 
interpreted as semantic categories.5 
Syntactic and semantic represen- 
tation in an information system 
The way of processing natural lan- 
guage according to the principles of COL- 
semantics shall be demonstrated by the 
linguistic component of a natural language 
information system. The description is o- 
riented at the application area and the 
structure of the system PLIDIS (informa- 
tion system for controll ing industrial 
water pollution, developed at the Insti- 
tut fuer deutsche Sprache, Mannheim). 6 
Giving only the over all structure of the 
system we have the following processings 
and levels: 
morphological analysis of natural 
language input ~ syntactic analysis (le- 
vel of syntactic representation) ~ trans- 
duction into formal representation lan- 
guage (level of semantic representation) 
interpretation (evaluation) against the 
database ~ answer generation 
The formal representation language 
is the language KS an extended first or- 
der predicate calculus, where the fea- 
tures going beyond predicate calculus are 
many sorted domain of individuals, lambda- 
abstraction and extended term building. 7 
In the following two aspects of the se- 
mantic representation will be treated: 
- the mapping between syntactical- 
ly analyzed natural language expressions 
and their KS counterparts will be inves- 
tigated 
- a differentiation between three 
levels of semantic representation will be 
accounted for: (level l) syntax-interpre- 
tative level, (level 2) canonical level, 
(level 3) database-related level, 
All three levels follow the same 
syntax, i.e. the syntax of KS and have 
the same compositional model theoretic se- 
mantics; they differ in their non logical 
constant symbols. 
_Mapping_natural language into the 
kemantic representation l~i!g~age KS 
In analogy with Montague's "theory 
of translation" in "Universal Grammar"we 
assume that the syntactic structures of 
natural language (NL, here German) and the 
semantic language (here KS) are similar, 
i.e. there exists a translation function 
f, such that the following holds: 
(l.l.) Given the categories of a 
categorial grammar of NL, f is mapping 
from these categories on the syntactic ca- 
tegories of KS. I.e. If m, ~I, ..., ~n are 
basic categories of German, then f(~), f 
(~I),..., f(#n) are syntactic categories of K$. 
If ~/~I/.../~n is a derived category (func- 
tor category) of NL, then f(~)/f(~1)/.../ 
f(~n) is a derived category of KS. 
(1.2.) If a is-an expression of ca- 
tegory 6 in NL (a6), then f(a) is an expres- 
sion of category f(6) in KS (f(a)f(6)). 
(1.3.) The concatenation of an ex- 
pression of the derived category m/~I/.../ 
#nwithexpress ions  of category ~1,...,#nre- 
sulting in an expression of category 
--203-- 
~/#I / . . . /~n ~ ~I ~ ... ~ Fn ~ 
is rendered in KS by the const ruct ion  of 
a list 
\ [ f~/~/ . . . /~n)  Z(~)  . . .  #(Fn) \ ]  
with the category ~'(~)(concatenation and 
list const ruct ion  are def ined for cate- 
gories instead of expressions in order to 
zmprove readabi l i ty) .  
Thus the ' t ransduct ion grammar' NL- 
KS is the triple 
< GNL, GKS, ~ > 
We now specify a minimal  categor ia\ [  
grammar of German GNL. A par t i cu lar  of 
GNL is the analysis  of verbs as m-ary  pre- 
dicates, i.e. in the categor ia l  frame- 
worK, as funct ions from m NP into S 8 and 
the analogue treatment of nouns as func- 
tot categor ies 9 taking their at t r ibutes 
as arguments.

Meaning postulates for generat ing 
~anonical  representat lons 
Both sentences have received differ- 
ent representat ions on level I, they are 
nevertheless synonymous at least as far 
as the context of information seeking is 
concerned. 
An important pr inciple in COL-se- 
mantics is the not ion of structural  (not 
lexical) synonymy. The fol lowing intui- 
t ively val id synonymy postulates (meaning 
postulates) can be formulated.

butes : 
eine Probe is synonymous eine Probe bei 
with einem Betrieb 
('a sample ('a sample of an 
of sewage industr ia l  plant' ) 
water ' ) 
The application of this principle 
may be iterated. 
(2 There are verb classes the elements 
of which have no descriptive meaning 
("non-content verbs"), in German the 
so called "Funktionsverben", the 
copula segn and others). In such ca- 
ses the NP as object or subject of 
the verb is the content bearer or 
'principal' NP, e.e. it becomes the 
predicate of the proposition. Such a 
sentence is synonymous with a cor- 
responding sentence containing a con- 
tent verb equivalent in meaning to 
the content bearing NP. For example: 
Arsengehalt l iegt in 
der Probe vor. 
('There exists an 
arsenic content  in 
the sample.') 
is  synonymous  
w i th  
Die Probe enth~it Arsen. 
('The sample contains 
arsenic. ')  
In such a non-content verb proposi- 
tion a noun phrase with a place hol- 
der attribute can also function as a 
"second order" principal NP, i.e. its 
unspecif ied attribute can be replaced 
by a "filler" NP, occurring as argu- 
ment of the non-content verb: 
Arsengehalt liegt bei Lauxmann in der Probe 
vor. is  synonymous  w i th  
Die Probe bei Lauxmann enthZlt Arsen. 
Both postulates shall be applied for 
transducing the level \] representations 
of NL sentences into level 2 representa- 
tions. We first give a definition of 
'principal term', i.e. the KS construc- 
tion corresponding to a 'principal NP'. 
(Def.) A principal term in a formula con- 
taining as PRAED the translation of anon  
content verb is a term that is capable, 
according to its semantic and syntactic 
structure, to embed other argument terms 
o~ the translation of the non content 
verb as its arguments. 
The operationalized version of the 
two principles is now after having shift- 
ed them onto the KS level: 
(1: maximality principle)When a NL-expres- 
sion has n analysis (n ~ 2J in level \] 
which only differ in the number of argu- 
ments, then the level 2 representation 
consists of the 'maximal' level I expres- 
sion, i.e. the expression containing the 
largest number of arguments. Any failing 
arguments are to be substituted by (ex- 
istentially bound~ variables. 
(2: transformation principle) 
(2.1.) When the PRAED of a formula is the 
translation of a non-content verb, at 
least one of its arguments must be a prin- 
cipal term. 
(2.2.) A formula containing the transla- 
tion of a non content verb must be trans- 
formed into an expression which contains 
the PRAED of a principal term as predi- 
cate iff there is an unambiguous mapping 
of the arguments of the translation of 
the non-content verb 
a) into arguments of a 
principal term 
or 
b) into a princapal term 
such that a wel l - formed formula of leve\] 
2 is obtained. 
We now state that PROBE and ENTHALT 
are 'maximal' expressions and PROBEI and 
ENTHALTI must be mapped into them re- 
spectively and that further holds: 
VORLIEG is the translation of the non- 
content verb vorliegen 
PROBE is the PRAED of a second order 
principal term with respect to 
a 'plant' argument 
ENTHALT is the PRAED of a principal term 
with respect to a 'sample' ar- 
gument 
Then the two examples of level I are 
mapped into a single representation on 
level 2: 
\[ENTHALT\[JOTA\[LAMBDA x\[PROBE G-L XJ\]\]AS1\] 
The reduction of synonymous structures in 
the canonical level of representation 
meets the criteria of economy as they are 
necessary in a computer system. II As we 
have tried to show, however,it can be 
based upon general l inguistic principles 
and need not be imputed to the field of 
"world semantics". On the other side ad- 
mitting paraphrases as natural language 
input (as our examples are) improves the 
systems "cooperativeness" towards the 
user. In PLIDIS special aspects of the 
world model are accounted for in the le- 
vel 3 representations which mirror the 
relational structure of the data model 
to some extent. We can not go into the 
details of the relationship between level 
2 and level 3 ~or reasons of space.

Comparison 
with other approaches 
Language processing systems that 
are oriented at Montague grammar or mo- 
del theoretic semantics are being devel- 
oped among others by Friedman et al, 
Sondheimer and the PHLIQAI group. A the- 
oretical discussion of the relationship 
between model theoretic semantics and AI- 
semantics can be found in Gunji and Sond- 
heimer cf. also Hobbs and Rosenschein 
St. Bien and Wilks (witha contrary vlew). 
The methodological ideas presented here 
are most closely related with the ap- 
proach of multi-level semantics pursued 
in PHLIQAi. But unlike the PHLIQAi ap- 
proach we regard the level(sJ of lingui- 
stic representation not only under the 
more formal aspect of syntax interpreta- 
tion but, as the last chapters show, we 
also take into account aspects of seman- 
tics of natural language word classes and 
structural synonymy. 
Notes 
1 There are certainly important inter- 
actions with empirial semantic work 
done in the last 10 years, soOrtony 
and Wilks stress the pervasive in- 
fluence of Fillmore. Like any other 
systematic distinction the one bet- 
ween formal llnguistic semantics and 
AI-semantics is somewhat simplifying: 
Within AI there are semantic approa- 
ches which are more or less oriented 
at formal logic, so the one of McCar- 
thy, Creary or Nash-Webber and Reiter 
and others. As typical AI-semantic ap- 
proaches we regard the ones of Schank 
and his colleagues, Wi?ks or Charniak 
(cf. for instance the articles in 
Charniak and Wilks). 
2 Hayes, 9 
3 Slightly exaggerating this tendency 
is formulated by Schank in Schank et 
al.):"Researchers in NPL (natural lan- 
guage processing in AI) have become 
less and less concerned with language 
issues per se. We are more interested 
in inferencing and memory models for 
example." (p. 1OO8) 
4 Such systems are presented for in- 
stance in Riesbeck, Norman and Rumel- 
hart, and even more programmatically 
in Schank et al, DeJong. Also in sys- 
tems conceived as data base interfaces 
like LIFER (Hendrix) and PLANES ~altz) 
"semantic"grammars are used. A theore- 
tical discussion on the role of syn- 
tax can be found in Schank et al 
5 I.e. one has to check, whether in sys- 
tems containlng only "part grammars" 
or working with a syntactic "pre-pro- 
cessing" the syntactic rules which 
were effectively used, can be com- 
bined resulting in a coherent and con- 
sistent grammar. Questions of syntac- 
tic-semantic and purely semantic gram- 
mars underlying parsers are also dis- 
cussed from a theoretical point of 
view in Wahlster. 
The system PLIDIS is described in 
Kolvenbach, L6tscher and Lutz. 
The language KS ("Konstruktsprache") 
is described in Zifonun. 
Cresswell gives an analogous categorial 
description for verbs. Like in this 
minimal grammar in applying the rule 
of concatenation phenomena of word or- 
der are neglected. 
Keenan and Faltz introduce the cate- 
gory of "function noun" (in our frame- 
work O-N/NP) 
10 The vague condition of "systematical- 
ly admitting" is made concrete in 
PLIDIS by prescribing a semantic"sort" 
for each argument of a predicate. 
ii This reduction is done in PLIDIS with 
the help of meaning postulates which 
are interpreted by a theorem prover.
