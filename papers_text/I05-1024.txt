Abstract. Many methods of term extraction have been discussed in
terms of their accuracy on huge corpora. However, when we try to apply
various methods that derive from frequency to a small corpus, we may
not be able to achieve sufficient accuracy because of the shortage of
statistical information on frequency. This paper reports a new way of
extracting terms that is tuned for a very small corpus. It focuses on the
structure of compound terms and calculates perplexity on the term unit?s
left-side and right-side. The results of our experiments revealed that the
accuracy with the proposed method was not that advantageous. However,
experimentation with the method combining perplexity and frequency
information obtained the highest average-precision in comparison with
other methods.
1 Introduction
Term extraction, which is the task of extracting terminology (or technical terms)
from a set of documents, is one of major topics in natural language processing. It
has a wide variety of applications including book indexing, dictionary generation,
and keyword extraction for information retrieval systems.
Most automatic term extraction systems make a sorted list of candidate terms
extracted from a given corpus according to the ?importance? scores of the terms,
so they require scores of ?importance? for the terms. Existing scores include
TF-IDF, C-Value [1], and FLR [9]. In this paper, we propose a new method
that involves revising the definition of the FLR method in a more sophisticated
way. One of the advantages of the FLR method is its size-robustness, i.e, it can
be applied to small corpus with less significant drop in performance than other
standard methods like TF and IDF, because it is defined using more fine-grained
features called term units. Our new method, called FPP, inherit this property
while exhibiting better performance than FLR.
At the same time, we also propose a new scheme for evaluating term ex-
traction systems. Our idea is to use summaries1 of articles as a gold standard.
This strategy is based on the assumption that summaries of documents can

serve as collections of important terms because, in writing summaries, peo-
ple may make an original document shorter by dropping unnecessary parts
of original documents, while retaining essential fragments. Thus, we regard a
term in an original document to be important if it also appears in the
summary.
2 Term Extraction
Term extraction is the task of extracting important terms from a given corpus.
Typically, term extraction systems first extract term candidates, which are usu-
ally the noun phrases detected by handcrafted POS sequence patterns, from the
corpus. After that, term candidates are sorted according to some importance
score. Important terms, (i.e., terms that appear in the summary, in our problem
setting,) are desired to be ranked higher than others. In this paper we focus
on the second step, i.e., term candidate sorting by importance scores. We pro-
pose a new score of term importance by modifying an existing one in a more
sophisticated manner.
In the remainder of this paper, a term candidate is represented by W = w1w2
? ? ? wn where wi represents a term unit contained in W , and n is the number of term
units contained in W . Here, a term unit is the basic element comprising term can-
didates that is not further decomporsable without destruction of meaning. Term
units are used to calculate of the LR score that is explained in the next section.
3 Related Work
Many methods of term scoring have been proposed in the literature [7] [3] [4].
Methods that use corpus statistics have especially emerged over the past decade
due to the increasing number of machine-readable documents such as news arti-
cles and WWW documents. These methods can be mainly categorized into the
following three types according to what types of features are used to calculate
the scores.
? Measurement by frequencies
? Measurement by internal structures of term candidates
? Combination of the above
3.1 Score by Frequency: TF
Frequency is one of the most basic features of term extraction. Usually, a term
that appears frequently is assumed to be important. We introduce a score of this
type: tf(W ).
tf(W ) represents the TF(Term Frequency) of W . It is defined as the number
of occurrences of W in all documents. Note that tf(W ) is the result of the
brute force counting of W occurrences. This method, for example, counts the
Automatic Term Extraction Based on Perplexity of Compound Words 271
term natural even if it is merely part of another phrase such as natural language
processing.2
3.2 Score by Internal Structures in Term Candidates: LR
An LR method [9] is based on the intuition that some words are used as term
units more frequently than others, and a phrase that contains such ?good? term
units is likely to be important. The left score l(wi) of each term unit wi of a target
term is defined as the number (or the number of types) of term units connected
to the left of wi (i.e., appearing just in the left of wi in term candidates), and the
right score r(wi) is defined in the same manner.3 An LR score lr(wi) is defined
as the geometric mean of left and right scores:
lr(wi) =
?
l(wi)r(wi)
The total LR score of W is defined as a geometric mean of the scores of term
units as:
LR(W ) = (lr(w1)lr(w2) ? ? ? lr(wn))
1
n .
An example of LR score calculation is given in the next section.
3.3 Mixed Measures
C-Value. C-Value[1] is defined by the following two expressions:
t(W ): frequency of terms that contain W ,
c(W ): number of types of terms that contain W .
Note that t(W ) does not count W itself. Intuitively, t(W ) is the degree of being
part of another term, and c(W ) is the degree of being part of various types of
terms.
C-Value is defined by using these two expressions in the following way.
c-val(W ) = (n ? 1) ?
(
tf(W ) ? t(W )
c(W )
)
Note that the value is zero where n = 1. MC-Value [9] is a modified version
of C-Value adapted for use in term collections that include the term of length 1
(i.e., n = 1).
MC-val(W ) = n ?
(
tf(W ) ? t(W )
c(W )
)
We used MC-Value in the experiments because our task was to extract terms
regardless of whether each term is one-word term or not.
2 We can also use another frequency score F(Frequency), or f(W ), that is defined as
the number of independent occurrences of W in all documents. (Independent means
that W is not included in any larger term candidate.) However, we observed that
f(W ) (or the combination of f(W ) and another score) had no advantage over tf(W )
(or the combination of tf(W ) and another score) in the experiments,so in this paper
we omit scores that are the combination of f(W ) and other scores.
3 In addition, we apply the adding-one smoothing to both of them to avoid the score
being zero when wi has no connected terms.

FLR. The LR method reflects the number of appearances of term units, but does
not reflect that of a whole term itself. For example, even if ?natural language? is
more frequent than ?language natural? and the former should be given a higher
score than the latter, LR cannot be used to do this.
An FLR method [9] was proposed to overcome this shortcoming of LR. It
reflects both the frequencies and inner structures of terms. FLR(W ) is defined
as the product of LR(W ) and tf(W ) as:
FLR(W ) = tf(W )LR(W ).

Fig. 1. An example of statistics for term unit connections
LR scores have two versions: Token-LR and Type-LR. Token-LR (and Type-
LR) are calculated by simply counting the frequency (and the types) of terms
connected to each term unit, respectively. In this case, a Type-LR score for the
term unit ?information? is
l(information) = 1 + 14, r(information) = 3 + 1, LR(information) =
?
8,
and a Token-LR score is
l(information) = 3 + 1, r(information) = 6 + 1, LR(information) =
?
28.
4 Note that the adding-one smoothing is applied.
Automatic Term Extraction Based on Perplexity of Compound Words 273
Type-LR cannot reflect frequencies which suggest whether there are spe-
cially important connecting terms or not. However, Token-LR cannot reflect the
number of types that suggest the variety of connections. To solve these short-
comings with LR measures, we propose a new kind that combines these two
through perplexity.
4.2 Term Extraction by Perplexity
Our method is based on the idea of perplexity [8]. The score of a term is defined
by the left perplexity and right perplexity of its term units. In this subsection we
first give a standard definition of the perplexity of language, from which our left
and right perplexity measures are derived. After that, we describe how to score
terms by using these perplexities.
Perplexity of language. Assume that language L is information source that
produces word lists of length n and each word list is produced independently
with probability P (wn1 ). Then, the entropy of language L is calculated as:
H0(L) = ?
?
wn1
P (wn1 ) log P (w
n
1 ).
The entropy per word is then calculated as:
H(L) = ? 1
n
?
wn1
P (wn1 ) log P (w
n
1 ).
This value indicates the number of bits needed to express each word generated
from L. Perplexity of language L is defined using H(L) as:
Perplexity = 2H(L).
Perplexity can be seen as the average number of types of words that follow each
preceding word. The larger the perplexity of L, the less predictable the word
connection in L.
Left and right perplexity. Assume that k types of unit words can connect to
the right of wi (see Figure 2).
Also assume that Ri is a random variable assigned to the i-th term unit which
represents its right connections and takes its value from the set {r1, r2, ? ? ? , rk}.
Then, entropy H(Ri) is calculated as:
H(Ri) = ?
k
?
j=1
P (rj) log2 P (rj)
Note that we define 0 log 0 = 0, according to the fact that x log x ? 0 where
x ? 0.

Fig. 2. Example of term unit and term units connected to its right
This entropy value can be thought of as a variety of terms that connect to
the right of wi, or, more precisely, the number of bits needed to describe words
that connect to the right of wi.
Then right perplexity ppr(wi) of term unit wi is defined as
ppr(wi) = 2H(R
i).
This value can be seen as the number of branches, in the sense of information
theory, of right-connection from wi. It naturally reflects both the frequency and
number of types of each connection between term units.
Random variable Li for the left connections is defined in the same manner.
The perplexity for left connections is thus defined as:
ppl(wi) = 2H(L
i).
Term Score by Perplexity. We define our measure by substituting l and r
in the definition of LR with ppl and ppr. First, a combination of left and right
perplexities is defined as the geometric mean of both:
pp(wi) = (ppl(wi) ? ppr(wi))
1
2 .
After that, perplexity score PP (W ) for W is defined as the geometric mean of
all pp(wi)s:
PP (W ) =
[
n
?
i=1
pp(wi)
]
1
n
.

We used log PP (W ) instead of PP (W ) to make implementation easier. Notice
that log x is a monotonic (increasing) function of x.
PP (W ) =

The right side means the sum of the left and right entropies of all term units.
4.3 Term Extraction by Perplexity and TF
Perplexity itself serves as a good score for terms, but combining it with TF,
which is a measure from another point of view, can provide a still better score
that reflects both the inner structures of term candidates and their frequencies
which are regarded as global information about the whole corpus.
Our new score, FPP (W ), which is a combination of PP and TF, is defined
as their product:
FPP (W ) = tf(W )PP (W )
? log2 FPP (W ) = log2 tf(W ) + log2 PP (W )
? log2 FPP (W ) = log2 tf(W ) +
1
2n
n
?
i=1
(
H(Ri) + H(Li)
)
We avoided the problem of log2 tf(W ) being undefined with tf(W ) = 0
5
by applying the adding-one smoothing to tf(W ). Therefore, the above defi-
nition of log FPP (W ) changed as follows:
log2 FPP
?(W ) = log2(tf(W ) + 1) +
1
2n
n
?
i=1
(
H(Ri) + H(Li)
)
.
We used this log2 FPP
?(W ) measure for evaluation.

corpus.

5 Experiments
5.1 Test Collection
We collected news articles and their summaries from the Mainichi Web News
from April, 2001 to March, 2002. The articles were categorized into four genres:
Economy, Society, World, and Politics. A shorter version of each article was
provided for browsing on mobile phones. Articles for mobile phones were written
manually from the original ones, which were shorter versions of the original
articles adapted to small displays. We regard them as summaries of the original
articles and used them to evaluate whether the extracted terms were correct
or not. If a term in the original article was also in the summary, the term was
correct, and incorrect if otherwise. Each article had a size of about 300 letters
and each summary had a size of about 50.
Table 1 lists the number of articles in each category.
Table 1. Number of articles in test collection

# of articles 4,177 5,952 6,153 4,428
5.2 Experimental Setup
We used test data on the various numbers of articles to investigate how the
performance of each measure changed according to corpus size. A corpus of each
size was generated by singly adding an article randomly selected from the corpus
of each genre. We generated test data consisting of 50 different sizes (from 1 to
50) for each genre. The average number of letters in the size 50 corpus was about
19,000, and the average number of term candidates was about 1,300. We used
five different seed numbers to randomly select articles. The performance of each
method was evaluated in terms of recall and precision, which were averaged over
the five trials.
5.3 Preprocessing: Term Candidate Extraction
Each article was preprocessed with a morphological analyzer, the Chasen 2.3.3.[2]
The output of Chasen was further modified according to heuristic rules as follows.
? Nouns and undefined words were extracted for further processes and other
words were discarded.
? Suffixes and prefixes were concatenated to their following and preceding
words, respectively.
The result was a set of term candidates to be evaluated with the term importance
scores described in the previous sections.
We applied the following methods to the term candidates: F, TF, DF
(Document Frequency) [8], LR, MC-Value, FLR, TF-IDF [8], PP, and FPP?.
Automatic Term Extraction Based on Perplexity of Compound Words 277
5.4 Evaluation Method
We used average precision [8] for the evaluation. Let D be a set of all the term
candidates and Dq ? D be a set of the correct ones among them. The extracted
term was correct if it appeared in the summary. Then, the average precision can
be calculated in the following manner.
Average-Precision =

where ri = 1 if the i-th term is correct, and ri = 0 if otherwise.
Note that the total number of correct answers was |Dq|. The next section
presents the experimental results obtained by average precision.

6 Results and Discussion
Table 2 shows the results on the corpus of 1, 10, and 50 articles in all the gen-
res. Figure 3 plots the average precision for each corpus size (from 1 to 50) in
the economy category.6 In some cases, results on one article were better than
those on 10 and 50 articles. This was mainly caused by the fact that the av-
erage precision is tend to be high on articles of short length, and the average
length for one article was much shorter than that of ten articles in some genres.
PP outperformed LR in most cases. We think the reason was that PP could
provide more precious information about connections among term units. We ob-
served that PP depended less on the size of the corpus than frequency-based
methods like TF and MC-Val. FPP? had the best performance of all methods in
all genres.
6 We only show a graph in the economy genre, but the results in other genres were
similar to this.

Figure 4 plots the results in the economy genre when the corpus size was
increased to 1,000 in increments of 50 articles. We observed that the perfor-
mance of PP and LR got close with the increase in corpus size, especially with
200 articles and more. FPP? once again outperformed all the other methods in
this experiment. The FPP? method exhibited the best performance regardless of
corpus size.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We proposed a new method for extracting terms. It involved the combination of
two LR methods: Token-LR and Type-LR. We showed that these two could be
combined by using the idea of perplexity, and gave a definition for the combined
method. This new method was then combined with TF and experimental results
on the test corpus consisting of news articles and their summaries revealed that
the new method (FPP?) outperformed existing methods including TF, TF-IDF,
MC-Value, and FLR.
In future work, we would like to improve the performance of the method by,
for example, adding preprocessing rules, such as the appropriate treatment of
numerical characters, and developing more sophisticated methods for combin-
ing TF and PP. We also plan to extend our experiments to include other test
collections like TMREC [6].
