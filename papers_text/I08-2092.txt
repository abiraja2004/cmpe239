Abstract
Defining all words in a Japanese dictio-
nary by using a limited number of words
(defining vocabulary) is helpful for Japanese
children and second-language learners of
Japanese. Although some English dictio-
naries have their own defining vocabulary,
no Japanese dictionary has such vocabu-
lary as of yet. As the first step toward
building a Japanese defining vocabulary, we
ranked Japanese words based on a graph-
based method. In this paper, we introduce
the method, and show some evaluation re-
sults of applying the method to an existing
Japanese dictionary.
1 Introduction
Defining all words in a dictionary by using a lim-
ited number of words (defining vocabulary) is help-
ful in language learning. For example, it would
make it easy for children and second-language learn-
ers to understand definitions of all words in the dic-
tionary if they understand all words in the defining
vocabulary. In some English dictionaries such as
the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE) (Proctor, 2005) and the Oxford Advanced
Learner?s Dictionary (OALD) (Hornby and Ashby,
2005), 2,000-3,000 words are chosen and all head-
words are defined by using the vocabulary. Such dic-
tionaries are widely used for language learning.
Currently, however, such a dictionary in which
a defining vocabulary is specified has not been
available in Japanese. Although many studies for
Japanese ?basic vocabulary? have been done (Na-
tional Institute for Japanese Language, 2000), ?ba-
sic vocabulary? in the studies means a vocabulary
which children or second-language learners have (or
should learn). In other words, the aim of such stud-
ies is to determine a set of headwords which should
be included in a Japanese dictionary for children or
second-language learners.
We think that there is a difference between ?defin-
ing vocabulary? and ?basic vocabulary?. Although
basic vocabulary is usually intended for learning ex-
pression in newspaper/magazine articles, daily con-
versation, school textbook, etc, a defining vocabu-
lary is intended for describing word definition in a
dictionary. Some words (or phrases) which are of-
ten used in word definition, such as ?... ?? (ab-
breviation of ...)?, ???? (change/shift)? 1, ???
(thing/matter)? etc, are not included in some kinds
of basic vocabulary. Additionally only one word in a
set of synonyms should be included in a defining vo-
cabulary even if all of them are well-known. For ex-
ample, if a word ??? (use)? is included in a defin-
ing vocabulary, synonyms of the word, such as ??
????, ?????? and ?????, are not needed.
A goal of this study is to try to build a Japanese
defining vocabulary on the basis of distribution
of words used in word definition in an existing
Japanese dictionary. In this paper, as the first step of
this, we introduce the method for ranking Japanese
words, and show some evaluation results of applying
the method to an existing Japanese dictionary. Also,
we compare the results with two kinds of basic vo-

2 Related Work
Kasahara et al constructed a Japanese semantic lex-
icon, called ?Lexeed? (Kasahara et al, 2004). The
lexicon contains the most familiar 28,000 Japanese
words, which are determined through question-
naires. All words in the lexicon are defined by using
16,900 words in the same lexicon. However, the size
of the vocabulary seems to be too large compared to
the size of the defining vocabularies used in LDOCE
and OALD. We also think that whether a word is fa-
miliar or not does not always correspond to whether
the word is necessary for word definition or not.
Gelbukh et al proposed a method for detecting
cycles in word definitions and selecting primitive
words (Gelbukh and Sidorov, 2002). This method
is intended for converting an existing ?human-
oriented? dictionary into a ?computer-oriented? dic-
tionary, and the primitive words are supposed not to
be defined in the dictionary.
Fukuda et al adopted an LSA-based (latent se-
mantic analysis) method to build a defining vocab-
ulary (Fukuda et al, 2006). The method would be
another solution to this issue although only a small
evaluation experiment was carried out.
3 Method
Our method for building a Japanese defining vocab-
ulary is as follows:
1. For each headword in an existing Japanese dic-
tionary, represent the relationship between the
headword and each word in the word definition
as a directed graph (word reference graph).
2. Compute the score for each word based on the
word reference graph.
3. Nominate the high ranked words for the
Japanese defining vocabulary.
4. Manually check whether each nominated word
is appropriate as defining vocabulary or not,
and remove the word if it is not appropriate.
In the rest of this section, we introduce our method
for constructing word reference graph and comput-
ing score for each word.
3.1 Word Reference Graph
A word reference graph is a directed graph repre-
senting relation between words. For each headword
in a dictionary, it is connected to each word in the
word definition by a directed edge (Figure 1). Nodes
in the graph are identified by reading, base form
(orthography), and parts-of-speech because some
words have more than one part-of-speech or reading
(??? (the reading is ?amari?)? has two parts-of-
speech, noun and adverb, and ???? has two read-
ings, ?shousetsu? and ?kobushi?). Postpositions,
auxiliary verbs, numbers, proper names, and sym-
bols are removed from the graph.
3.2 Computing The Score for Each Word
The score of each word is computed under the as-
sumption that
1. A score of a word which appears in many word
definitions will be high.
2. A score of a word which appears in the defini-
tion of a word with high score will also be high.
680
If a word is included in a defining vocabulary, words
in the word definition may need to be included in
order to define the word. The second assumption
reflects the intuition. We adopt the algorithm of
PageRank (Page et al, 1998) or LexRank (Erkan and
Radev, 2004), which computes the left eigenvector
of the adjacency matrix of the word reference graph
with the corresponding eigenvalue of 1.
4 Evaluation
4.1 Experimental Setup
We used the Iwanami Japanese dictionary corpus
(Hasida, 2006). The corpus was built by annotating
the Iwanami Japanese dictionary (the 5th edition)
with the GDA tags (Hasida, 2004) and some other
tags specific to the corpus. Although it has many
kinds of tags, we focus on information about the
headword (hd), orthography (orth), part-of-speech
(pos), sentence unit in word definition (su), and mor-
pheme (n, v, ad, etc.). We ignore kind of addi-
tional information, such as examples (eg), grammat-
ical explanations (gram), antonyms (ant), etymology
(etym), references to other entries (sr), etc, since
such information is not exactly ?word definition?.
Words in parentheses, ???? and ????, are also
ignored since they are used to quote some words or
expressions for explanation and should be excluded
from consideration of defining vocabulary.
Some problems arose when constructing a word
reference graph.
1. Multiple ways of writing in kanji:
For example, in the Iwanami Japanese dictio-
nary, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????,
???? and ???? appear in an entry of a
verb ?hiku? as its orthography. If more than
one writing way appear in one entry, they are
merged into one node in the word reference
graph (they are separated if they have different
part-of-speech).
2. Part-of-speech conversion:
While each word in word definition was an-
notated with part-of-speech by corpus annota-
tors, part-of-speech of each headword in the
dictionary was determined by dictionary edi-
tors. The two part-of-speech systems are differ-
ent from each other. In order to resolve the dif-
ference, we prepared a coarse-grained part-of-
speech system (just classifying into noun, verb,
adjectives, etc.), and converted part-of-speech
of each word.
3. Word segmentation:
In Japanese, words are not segmented by spaces
and the word segmentation policy for corpus
annotation sometimes disagree with the pol-
icy for headword registration of the Japanese
Iwanami dictionary. In the case that two con-
secutive nouns or verbs are in word definition
and a word consisting of the two words is in-
cluded as a headword in the dictionary, the two
words are merged into one word.
4. Difference in writing way between a head-
word and a word in word definition:
In Japanese language, we have three kind
of characters, kanji, hiragana, and katakana.
Most of the headwords appearing in a dictio-
nary (except loanwords) are written in kanji as
orthography. On the other hand, for example,
?? (matter)? is usually written in hiragana (?
???) in word definition. However, it is diffi-
cult to know automatically that a word ????
in word definition means ???, since the dictio-
nary has other entries which has the same read-
ing ?koto?, such as ?? (Japanese harp)? and ?
?? (ancient city)?. We merged two nodes in
the word reference graph manually if the two
words are the same and only different in the
writing way.
As a result, we constructed a word reference graph
consisting of 69,013 nodes.
We adopted the same method as (Erkan and
Radev, 2004) for computing the eigenvector of the
adjacency matrix (score of each word). Damping
factor for random walk and error tolerance are set to
0.15 and 10?4 respectively.
4.2 Result
Table 1 shows the top-50 words ranked by our
method. Scores are normalized so that the score of
the top word is 1.

lary?, such as ??? (exist)?, ??? (certain/some)?
2, ??? (do?)?, ?? (thing)?, etc., but also words
which are not so common but are often used in

On the other hand, some words in the top ranked
words, such as ?A? and ?B?, seem not to be appro-
priate for defining vocabulary. These words appear
only in word definition and are not included in the
Iwanami Japanese dictionary as headwords (i.e. un-
registered words) 3. The score of an unregistered
word tends to be higher than it should be, since the
node corresponding to the word has no edge to other
nodes in the word reference graph.
Figure 2 shows word coverage, i.e. percentage
of words appearing in word definition which were
ranked in the top-n. From the result (solid line),
we can find that the increase in coverage around
n = 10, 000 is low and the coverage increases sud-
denly from n = 15, 000. This is because all un-
registered words were ranked in the top-15000. If
all unregistered words are removed, the increase in
coverage gets gradually lower as n increases (dotted
line).
In construction of a word reference graph, 9,327
words were judged as unregistered words. The rea-
son is as follows:
1. Part-of-speech mismatch:
In order to solve the difference between the
part-of-speech system for annotation of head-
words and the system for annotation of words
in the definition of each headword, we pre-
3In some word definitions, roman letters are used as vari-
ables.

pared a coarse-grained part-of-speech system
and converted part-of-speech of each word.
However, the conversion failed in some cases.
For example, some words are annotated with
suffix or prefix in word definition, while they
are registered as noun in the dictionary.
2. Mismatch of word segmentation:
Two consecutive nouns or verbs in word def-
inition were merged into one word if a word
consisting of the two words is included as
a headword in the Iwanami Japanese dictio-
nary. However, in the case that a compound
word is treated as one word in word defini-
tion and the word is not registered as a head-
word in Iwanami Japanese dictionary, the word
is judged as an unregistered word.
3. Error in format or annotation of the corpus:
Since the Iwanami Japanese dictionary corpus
has some errors in format or annotation, we
removed entries which have such errors be-
fore construction of the word reference graph.
Headwords which were removed for this reason
are judged as unregistered words.
4. Real unregistered words:
Some words in word definition are not regis-
tered as headwords actually. For example, al-
though a noun ??? (English language)? ap-
pears in word definition, the word is not regis-
tered as a headword.
Unregistered words should carefully be checked
whether they are appropriate as defining vocabulary
or not at the third step of our method described in
section 3.
4.3 Comparison
In order to look at the difference between the result
and so-called ?basic vocabulary?, we compared the
result with two types of basic vocabulary: one was
built by the National Institute for Japanese Language
(including 6,099 words) and the other was built by
the Chuo Institute for Educational Research (includ-
ing 4,332 words) (National Institute for Japanese
Language, 2001). These two types of vocabulary are
intended for foreigners (second-language learners)

Figure 3 shows recall, i.e. percentage of the num-
ber of words appearing in both our result and each
vocabulary out of the number of words in the vo-
cabulary. As in the case of word coverage, the in-
crease in recall around n = 10, 000 is low if unreg-
istered words are not removed (solid lines). If the
same number of headwords as the size of each basic
vocabulary are picked up from our result, it can be
found that about 50% of the words are shared with
each basic vocabulary (dotted lines).
Some of the high-ranked words out of the two ba-
sic vocabularies and some of the low-ranked words
in the vocabularies are listed in Table 2 and 3. Al-
though it would be natural that the words listed in
Table 2 are not included in the basic vocabular-
ies, they are necessary for describing word defini-
tion. On the other hand, the words listed in Table 3
may not be necessary for describing word definition,
while they are often used in daily life.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the method for ranking
Japanese words in order to build a Japanese defining
vocabulary. We do not think that a set of the top-
n words ranked by our method could be a defining
vocabulary as is. The high ranked words need to
be checked whether they are appropriate as defining
vocabulary or not.
As described in section 1, defining all words with
a defining vocabulary is helpful in language learn-
ing. In addition, we expect that the style of writing
word definitions (e.g. which word should be used,
whether the word should be written in kanji or hira-
gana, etc.) can be controlled with the vocabulary.
This kind of vocabulary could also be useful for
NLP researches as well as language learning. Ac-
tually, defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and
OALD are often used in some NLP researches.
The future work is the following:
? The size of a defining vocabulary needs to be
determined. Although all words in LDOCE or
OALD are defined by 2,000-3,000 words, the
size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be
larger than English ones.
? Wierzbicka presented the notion of conceptual
primitives (Wierzbicka, 1996). We need to look
into our result from a linguistic point of view,
and to discuss the relation.
? It is necessary to consider how to describe word
definition as well as which word should be used
for word definition. Definition of each word in
a dictionary includes many kinds of informa-
tion, not only the word sense but also historical
background, grammatical issue, etc. Only word
sense should be described with a defining vo-
cabulary, since the other information is a little
different from word sense and it may be diffi-
cult to describe the information with the same
vocabulary.
