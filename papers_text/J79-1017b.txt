SUMMARY 
ATEF converts an input string into a labeled tree; t h e  label 
evolves under the control  of a grammar. A se t  of labels is 
associated with each segment of the string, and several func- 
tions permit control of the number of alternative labels. 
CETA simulates a transformatianal grammar. It uses a set o f  
grammars with conditional linkages. The applicabili&y of a 
transformation can be determined in p a r t  by conditions on the 
resulting t ree.  
Computer processing 3f natural languages requires more or 
less polished algorithmic models. The two systems presented 
here represent a choice of a large class among the algorithms 
proposed in recent years to solve these problems. The prin- 
c ipa l  choice determined by these systems l i e s  in the formal use 
of labeled trees ( arborescences ) . Freedom of choice of these 
la-bels and possible structures gives these systems broad fields 
of applications in several domains and notably in that of the 
automatic processing of natural languages. The ATEF system has 
the purpose of transformFng a string of words into a tree which 
is manipulable by the CETA system. The definition of labeled 
trees determines what objects CETA can manipulate and the objec- 
ti'ves of ATEF. This note therefore begins with the definition 
of labeled trees. To obtain a tree of this type beginning with 
an input string, ArEF uses a dictionary and a finite-state gram- 
mar. The result of this system can be manipulated by CETA in 
order to obtain the desired type of structure. T h e  example of 
analysis given here shows the  possibilities of the CETA system 
w?th two different manipulative strategies: search for consti- 
tuent or dependency structure . 
1, LABELED TREES 
A rree is a set of points with which is associated a struc- 
ture, that is to say a relation having the properties: 
The relation between two points is directed (one 
point depends on the other )  
A point Cannot depend on a point belonging to its 
own descent set (the descent set of a point is the 
set of points that depend on it, the points that 
depend on them, etc. ) 
A unique point descends from no other. 
It is possible to draw a tree placing below a point all of its 
descendants, linked by lines. (See the example on the next 
frame. ) 
A labeled tree is a tree such that with each of its points 
is associated a lab-el This label IS formed of a set of data. 
The figure below represents a labeled tree.

7: T - E  ATEF SYSTEM 
The purpose of the ATEF system is to transform an input 
sming of words i n t o  a labeled t r e e ,  each word in the string 
p o s s i b l y , l e a d i n g  to one or several points in the final tree 
(ambiguity). The determination of the label originating in an 
input word results from its analysis. This analysis proceeds 
by segme~tation of the input  word according t o  elements f r o m  
d i f f e r e n t  dictional:  ies . A correct segmentation therefore gives. 
a label for a p o i n t  of the  f i n a l  tree . Tn advance of any. 
analysis, the definition of the elements employed in the compo- 
sition of different labels is required and is supplied by two 
Eiles called variable declaration files. 
A label will consist of a set bf variables. Each variable 
must be defined with its set of possible values. Thus if one 
defines the variable "category" the set of "categories" that 
can be used must be specified. The set is writ ten 
category = (NOUN, ARTICLE, PRONOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, . . . )  
(A constraint requires that the name of a variable must not be 
longer than 7 characters. Thus the preceding var2able could be 
written, for example, CAT = (NN, ART, Pm, ADJ, VRB, . . . )  ) 
The definitdon of a particular label consists in an enume- 
ration of the variables relevant to the  label. A se t  of labels 
can be predefined and is collected in a so-called format file. 
The ATEF system analyzes the words and thus employs dictionaries 
A dictionary is a set of segments (character strings), ~ t h  each
of which is associated a label, a processing pointer, and a 
lexical unit pointer. The processing pointer specifies the par- 
ticular process which must be associated with the segment. 
The analysis of the input word by the ATEF system resides 
at first in a label processing, that is to say in an evolution 
of the empty label toward a final label characteristic of the 
analyzed word This evolution is controlled by the grammar, 
which at each moment has access to two labels. the label being 
developed (noted by the symbol C) and the  label associated w i t h  
the segment which was read in the dictionary (noted by A) The 
analysis of a word aims to produce a segmentation of t h e  woru 
simultaneously compatible with the segments of the di f ferent  
dictionaries (the word must be an assembly of dictionary seg- 
ments) and compatible with a correct evolution of the grammar 
Thus the segmentation of the input ~ o r d  is tighcly bound to 
the evolution of the grammar which controls the coherence of 
the segmentation In the course of a segmentation operation 
the state of the system takes into account for the analyzed 
word 
the  label resuLting from the analysis of the  
segments a l ~ e a d y  obtarned for this word 
the label associated with  the segment found 
in a dictlonary 
the remaining characters of the input word 
the complete form of the i n p u t  word 
Thus for example in the course of the analysis of the 
word irresistible and after analysis of the segment " ib le"  
and in the course of reading the segment 'resist1' the 
following erements are obtained 
C the label resulting from the analysis of "ible" 
This label contains for example the v a r i a b l e  
derivation with value verb-adj, the variable 
gender with value masculine and feminine, the 
variable number with value singular. 
A the label associated with  the segment''resist 
T h i s  label coatains notably the lexical unit 
"resister", the varlable category with value verb 
The character$ IR 
The complete form IRRESISTIBLE 
The purpose of the grammar is to permit or prevent the 
evolution of label C starting wlth label A Here, the l abe l  
will evolve and obtaln the variable category wlth value adjec- 
tive. A rule associated with the segment "resist" by means of 
its pointer will therefore describe this evolution of the label 
C. When no evolution of the label C is possible, the corres- 
ponding segmentation is blocked and considered nonsignificant. 
The set of labels plays a fundamental role in this system 
and forms the s e t  of s t s ~ t e s  o f  the f i n i t e  state transducer 
corresponding to the l og i ca l  model of the system Each coherent 
segmentation of a word (a word can have several coherent segmen- 
tations leading to ambiguities) provides a labeled point in the 
final tree Three elements are fundamental to the system 
the choice and evolution of the segmentation 
the calculation of the set of labels associated 
with a word 
the positioning of the labeled points created by 
the analysis of a word in the final tree 
The choice and evolution of the segmentation has to do with 
the sequence of input characters. The segmentation forces, 
above all, a prior linguistic choice. Thus with the segment "UN" 
two possibilities can be conceived 
either accept "UN E" as a coherent segmentation 
or have the segment "Ul?E" in the dictionary and 
refuse the segmentation "UN El' 
For each initial form several segmentations are possible 
to arrive at the same results arid only a linguie tic study of 
the phenomena permits a decision on the strategy to be adopted. 
In any event, this stLategy is left to the user of the system 
In the course of a segmentation the system can operate d~rectly 
on the nonsegmented chatacters in order to force them into a 
"canonical'! form. Thus in the case of the word reel several 
possib~lities arise to accept a word like realite 
put the segment "real" in a dictionary as well as 
the segmenf "reel", the former will generate words 
like realite, irrealite, e t c .  
put the single segment "reel" in the dictionary and 
the analysis of the word realite Qill follow the 
schema 
realit& => 1st segment found "lte", remainder "real" 
mddificat&on r ea l  ->r&el => 2nd segment found "reel" 
segmentation ."riSel it&" 
N B In thls analysis, it is to be noted that the 
search for successive segqents is performed from 
left to right ?ox the input word. This depends on 
the strategy adopted and, for a given use, the 
direction of the segmentatson of a word can be either 
left to right or right to l e f t .  
To avoid a proliferation of possible segmentations and there- 
fore of possible solutions, several functions provide for inter- 
vention in the segmentation A first possibility is offered b : ~  
the management of  the dictionaries In fact, the system includes 
several dictionaries and after isolation of each segment the 
I I system can open" or "close" a dictionary 
This method makes it easy to avoid, for example, looking 
?or two consecutive prefixes. Another mode of intervention 
uhich is more d i r e c t ,  i s  peovided by the presence of functions 
acting on the enumeration procedures by which the system counts 
~ f f  solutions. For example, t h e  system analyzes a l l  possible 
segmentations starting with a given segment beginning with the 
segmentations containing most characters. An intervention at 
this level makes i t  possible h o t  t o  analyze but to reject sub- 
segmentations of P segment. The analysis of the segment "UNE" 
can, for example, r e j e c t  the analysis of the  subsegment "UN E" 
(Observe that the segmentation of the word "chacune" will then 
be obtained as G A C  UNE because th8 segmentation CHACUN E will. be 
rejected as a subsegmentation of "UNE" This problem can easily 
be resolved because these  functions appear in the  rules of the 
grammar and are consequently conditional. One can at the same 
time f"orbid the subsegmentation "UN E-" in the word "UNE" and 
aur;horize this. segmentatian in the word "CHACUNE") 
The calculation of the set of labels associated ~ i t h  a word 
is produced and controled by the grammar. This calculation cor- 
responds above all with a conditianal modification of the label C 
or current state starting from the label A or argument state. 
The condition f o r  the  evolution of t h i s  label is such that if no 
evolution is possible then the corresponding segmentation Ls 
rejected. This condition can refer to the labels of the pre- 
ceding analyzed words and can condition its result on the analysis 
of the following form. Thus for example in the course of the 
analysis of the word "LA" in the sequence "il la voit", the 
segmentation taking "la" as art ic le  can be rejected. The t rans-  
fer of information to di f fe ren t  labels can be realized through 
a s s i g n m e n t t o t h e  following label S .  When this label has been 
assigned in  the course of the  analysis of a word the analysis 
of the follow'ing word w i l l  begin with the assigned label instead 
ef the null l a b e l .  
The final result of the system i s  a labeled tree. With no 
supplementary specification i n  the course o f  analysis, this tree 
appears in the following form: 
0' 
w ---- 4 3  w n Au .p - -- A fi, A >* 
s o l u t i o n  1 I s o l u t i o n  & 
phrase I p h ~ a s e  I phrase p phrase p 
The solution for a sentence ( ~ h r a s e )  consists of a string 
of labe l s  (one f o r  each word of the sentence), each of which 
represents an interpretation of a ward of th i s  sentence. In 
this case, the sentence is not structured; simply the ambiguities 
are sepa~ated. Th t h e  course of the analysis  of the words, a 
first sketch of a construct5an can be made and give as r e s u l t  a 
m o r e  developed tree. These functions spec i fy  the pos i t ion  that 
the point t o  which t h e  calculated mask applies must take in the 
final tree. This position is determined in a l l  cases below a 
p o i n t  w, and is relative to the  root ( f i r s t  p o i n t  on the l e f t  
below wi) and to the rightmost p o i n t  of the tree already con- 
structed. Thus this point can become itself the root, the 
rightmost leaf, etc. 
With, for example, the  analysis of the string "une belle 
maison", we can. have 
1 1  during the analysis  of une", no t ree  
during the analysis of "belle", the tree eontains the 
single point "une". A function can render the point 
"belle" as root and give b e l l e  
une 
during the analysis of "maison", if the constructed 
tree is belle,. a function can provide for swapping 
w e  
the root with t he  occurrence i n  work and give the tree 
une belle. 
In this case, the result f o r  the system w i l l  be 
une belle 
5 ,  THE CETA SYSTEM 
The CETA system provides for writing and s5mulating a 
transformational grammar. This system manipulates l a b e l e d  trees 
of the type described above ( l abe l ed  trees produced by the ATEF 
or other system). To construct a transformational grammar with 
this system two complementary elements are necessary: 
the set of rules used defines the s e t  of prfmitives 
of the system for a given application 
The set of grammars and the d e f i n i t i o n  of t he i r  
linkage defines the mode of use of the primitives 
The definition of a transformation rule defines a mode of 
potential transformation of the tree considered. A rule is de- 
fined by a le'fthand part representing the subtree to be modi- 
f i e d  and a righthand part defining the resulting subtree. For 
example, l e t  the following be two rules: 
ART NMC 
ART [ U M ~

On the tree r e s u l t i n g  f r o m  t he  analysis by t he  ATEF system

have the  following applications:

In fact, the~defin'itton of a transformation can call on a 
hierarchical set of subtrees. In t h e  example taken here, the 
i n p u t  tree is not very "deep" and most often only one-level trees 
are applicable. However, in t he  course of development of a corn- 
plete structure, tshe considered tree is arbitrary and the defini- 
tion of a complex transformation constructed beginning with 
several subtrees is very refined. The subtrees defined in a 
rule can likewise be considered. ordered or unordered Let

The linkage of the different rules previously described is 
defined by the set of elementary grammars. An elementary gram- 
mar c~~n~ists of ordered rules. A rule Ri will be applied prior 
to an R. if the order of R .  is less ahan the order of R J 1 j An 
elementary grammar has furthermore a mode of execution. Atl ele- 
mentary grammmar unitarily executable is such that its result 
will be obtained after an application of a part of the set of 
rules mentioned. (An application of the rules mentioned can 
cause to appear new possible applications which will not be per- 
formed in this case.) Anoth-er mode of application of an elemen- 
tary grammar is exhaustive. In this mode, the set of rules of 
the gzammar will be applied up ro the maximum but the application 
of a given rule has the effect o f  eliminating it from this ele- 
mentary grammar. (That is, for a given point.) With this second 
mode of application, the number of possible steps for a given 
tree is always finite. Within an elementary grammar which is 
unitarily or exhaustively exechtable, the presence of recursive 
rules makes. it possible to  obtain complex constructions by 
simulating repeti t ive procedures. A recursive rule is charao- 
terized by a call to a new grammar (which can obviously be the 
same as thae in which the recursive rule is found). The result 
o f ' t h e  application of a recursive rule consists of the tree 
obtained after transformation by the called grammar of rhe tree 
transformed by the rule in question. 
For example, let R3 and R2 be the-rules previously described. 
The elementary grammar G consistiag of these two rules will 
furnish as result,

At the  1970 International Political Science Associatio~ 
Congress in Munich, the first informal meeting was held of 
what became Research Cornittee Number One of the Association, 
the Committee on Conceptual and Tem~nological Analysis (COCTA) 
This committee (which includes political scient ists, sociolo- 
gists, anthropologists, linguists, and philosophers) has been 
moving toward several objectives of concept clarification in 
political and social analysis. COCTA has organized panels at 
many polirical science and socialogy associations, including 
its formal, association with the C mparative Interdisciplinary 
Studies Section of the International Studies Association as 
the Internet on Conceptual and Terminological Analysis. Over 
the half-decade of its existence, COCTA has developed sever31 
separate stages of concepmal analysis including special foci 
on metalinguistics, concept construction and reconstruction, 
and clarification of the theoretical usages of concepts. Under- 
lying these and other interebts is a prerequisite need for an 
inventory of concepts-in-use. The rationale for attempting to 
develop the inventory, and discussion of its potential usages, 
are fully stated in my Commencement of a S y s t e m a t i c  C o n c e p t  
COCTA 
Cozlection This statement sets  f o r t h  the description of the 
resulting official COCTA Concept inventory2. 
The inventory is a rather ambitious project that will 
depend upon the contributions of interested scholars. It will 
begin with special focal points within political science and 
sociology as a pilot project. The logic of this pilot collec- 
tion, however, is to provide a framework within which che col- 
lection can be expanded into other social sciences and related 
fields in the humanities. The immediate task is to commence 
the collection of social science concepts-in-use and to demon- 
strate the inventory's utility. Since the inventory can be 
commenced on ly  by volunteers, the aid of scholars from several 
disciplines is essential to its success. Any concepts can be 
listed by interested scholars. 
The present proceduxes for entering concepts into the in- 
ventory are simple. Scholars in the fields record concepts 
and related information according to the inventory's format 
and mail them .tro me. These materials will be edited and sent 
to Carl Beck at the University of Pittsburgh where the concepts 
and information will be recorded and stored (the Pittsburgh 
'~ittsburgh: Univer.sity Center for International Studies, 
No. 9, 1974. See also the other COCTA papers listed therein. 
2 ~ h e  f h a l  design of the collection has seriously bene- 
fitted from comments from Fred W Riggs, from those who attended

evening discussions and presentations of their own results by 
participants. About 100 persons from Germany, Great Britain, 
Italy, Holland, Denmark, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway,

etc. The courses offered embraced a wide range of topics  re- 
l a t e d  t o  semantics. Some of t h e m  w e r e  inrroductory courses, 
others were survey courses including the lecturers' own scien-

research. This variety of fields taught at different levels 
was well su i t ed  to the audience.

describing at greater length those which were most relevant 
to us 
PARSING ENGLI S-H - Y o r i c k  Wilks 
A survey and comparison of some of the better known A1 
systems, t h i s  course began with certain fundamental concepts 
and general characteristics of relevance for all the-systems 
in question. A principal issue is parsing. Wilks defined it 
as "prooedural ascription of structures to sentences, where 
the structures are pot smtactic at all, but semantic. 1 I 
Parsing may be done in two different ways: TOP-DOWN or BOTTOM- 
UP. Bottom up is the more straightforward way. The words of 
the sentence are listed and each word is replaced by its cate- 
gory Then pairs o f  category symbols (for instance Verb + NP) 
are rewritten by reversing the grammar's rewrite rules (Verb + 
NP - - >  VP) until the final sentence symbol S is reached. The 
lines of the derivation can then be considered as the parsing. 
T U T O R I A L  ON COMPUTATIONAL S E M A N T I C S .  
Top-down parsing is the reverse procedure starting with the 
generations and continuing from left to right until the last 
word is reached. Another important pair of teahnical terms is 
BREADTH-FIRST and DEPTH-FIRST. Breadth-f i rs t  is the para l le l  
treatment of all possible alternative structures at a given 
time, none of which is given precedence. In depth-first pafses,, 
the akternative structures are treated sequentially. So far 
the description may apply to any kind of parsing, but it was 
Wilks's aim t o  demonstrate pars ing  procedures where the struc- 
tures are not syntactic but semantic. He described his own 
view of semantics as a version of the "meaning is procedures" 
attitude, i e. the procedures of its application give a pgrsed 
structure its s-ignificance. 
After mentioning what he called the "problem of natural 
lang~sge", by which he meant the problem of systsmatic ambiguity, 
Wilks gave a brief historical sketch of the first approaches to 
machine translation, the failure J ?  which he put down to the 
ambiguity problem. 
Terry Winograd has proposed a distinction between "first" 
and "second" generation CI language systems. This distinction 
that seems no* to be wfdely acceptad also lies behind the survey 
below, where the systems of Winograd and Woods are considered 
first-generation and those of Simmons, Schank, Charniak, and Wilks 
belong to the second ge~eration. Winograd's well-known dialogue 
system SHRDLU operates in a closed world o f  colored blocks  and 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIOhAL SEMANTICS 50 
pyrdmids. The gratnmatj of SHRDLU is not the conventional list 
of rules but s ~ l l  subprograms that actually represent procedures 
for imposing the desired grammatical structure. In terms of: the 
notions set out earlier, Winograd's parsing is top-down and 
depth-first. After the syntactic parsing a number of "semantic 
specialistst1 attach semantic structvres to specific syntactic 
structures. These semantic structures can then be used by the 
deductive component of the system. Woods's system, tob, is 
considered first-generation, but both Woods and Winograd have 
argued that their systems are essentially equivalent, which is 
the reason why Wilks described only one of them in detail 
What the second-generation systems have in common is the 
assumption that understanding. systems-must be able to manipulate 
very complex linguistic abjects, or semantic structures, and that 
no simplistic approach to understanding language with computers 
rill work. A common Peature in connection with second-generation 
systems is what Rinsky (1974) c a l l s  a FRAME. It is described 
as a data-structure representing a stereotyped. situation and 
attempting to specify in advance what is going to be said, and 
h~w.the world encountered is going to be structured. 
Colby s system, too, is a dialogue system, by which an 
interview between a doctor and a paranoid patient called PARRY 
is carried out. The input text is segmented by a heuristic 
that breaks it at any occurrence of key words. Patterns are 
then matched with each word string segment. Stored in the same 
format as the patterns are rules expressing the conseque-xes 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS. 
f o ~  the 2atient of detecting aggression and overfriendliness in 
the interviewer's questions and remarks. The matched patterns 
are then tied directly, or via these inference rules, to che 
response patterns which are generated. A very interesting as- 
pect of the PARRY system is the fact that the answers of the 
system cannot be distinguished from those of a human patient 
This fact suggests that many people on many occasions seem to 
understand the information they receive in the same way that 
PARRY does. 
Schank's is a rich system of semanti.: representation. It 
consists of the following three components: 
1. an ANALYZER of English, due to Riesbeck 
2 .  a SEMANTIC MEMORY Component, due to Rieger 
3 .  a GENERATOR OF ENGLISH, due to Goldman 
The aim of Schank's system is to provide a representation of 
meaning in terms of which different kinds of analysis and 
machine translation can be carried out; a representation, more- 
over, that is independent 0.f any particular language ,. and of 
syntax, and, indeed, of all traces o f  surface structure 
After a detailed description of Schank's so-called CONCEP- 
TUALIZATIONS, built up by conceptual categories, primitive acts, 
cases, etc., Wi-lks gave his own comments an Schank's system. 
Like that of Schank, Wilks's system has a uniform represen- 
tation, in the shape of structures and primitives, for the 
content of natural language. I t  is uniform in that t he  
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 52 
information that might conventionally be considered syntactic, 
semantic or factual is all represented within a single struc- 
ture of complex entities (called FORMULAS and P A R A P L A T E S ) ,  all 
of which are in turn constructed from 80 primitive semantic 
entities. The formulas are tree structures of semantic primi- 
tives, stored in the dictionary of the system. The main element 
in any formula is its "head", i. e. t h e  fundamental category t o  
which the  formula belongs. Sentences and their parts are repre- 
sented by the socalled TEMPLATE STRUCTURES, built up as networks 
of formulas. Templates always consist of an agent node, an 
action node, and an object node, and other nodes that may be 
governed by these. A formula o r ,  say, the noun."drinkl' can 
be thought of as an entity at a template action node, selecting 
a liquid object, that is to say a formula with FLOW STUFF as 
its head, to be put at the object node of the template (sentence 
structure). This seeking is preferential in that formulas not 
satisfying a given requirement will be accepted, but only if 
nothing satsifying it can be found. The template ultimately 
established for a fragment of text is the one in which the most 
formulas have their preferences satisfied. This preference 
principle is of essential importance in connection with solving 
the many ambiguity problems in natural language texts. When 
the local. inferences have been done that s e t  up the agentr 
action-object templates for fragments of input text, the system 
attempts to tie these templates together so as to provide an 
overall initial structure for the inaut called a CASE TIE. 
TUTORIAL ON CUMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 53 
Case ties are made with the aid of angther class of ordered 
structures called PARAPLATES, each of which is a string of 
functions that seek inside templates for information. The 
last step in the parsing is the inference procedure in which 
commonsense inference rules attempt by a simple strategy to 
construct the shortest possible chain of rule-linked template 
forms, on the principle of preference. 
The other main section of this course was a comparison of 
the parsing systeps described, including Charniak's system. 
This,comparison was based on the following principal aspects: 
LEVEL O F  REPRESENTATION. At this point there qre two Op- 
posite views: that language can be realized or represented at 
different levels depending on the subject matter, or that the 
appropriate level of computation for inferences about natural 
language has to be to some degree reduced. The different level 
attitude is supported mainly by Colby and Charniak, while 
Schank and Wilks hold that a certain primitivization is necessary 
CENTRANTY OF INFORMATION. This aspect concerns the degree 
of s p e c i f i c i t y  of the information required. Some systems, Iike 
Charniak's, are based on in fomat ion  highly specific to particu- 
lar situations, while the sorts of information central to 
Sohank's and Wilks's systems are of a much niore general nature, 
consisting mainly of partial assertions about hman wants, 
expectations, and so on. This problep of centrality is of 
great theoretecal importance, which Wflks illustrated by an 
example: A person might know nothing of a particular type of 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 54 
situation, for instance a birthday party, but could not for 
this reason be accused of not understanding the language. Yet, 
if he did not have available some very general inference such 
as for instance people gettihg sleepy at night, then it is 
possible that his failure to understand quite srmple sentences 
would cause observers to think that he did not know the lan- 
guage. Wilks went on: 
An interesting and difficult question that then 
arises is whether those who concentrate on central 
and less central areas of discourse could, in principle, 
weld their bodies of inference together in such a way 
as to create a wider system; whether, to put the matter 
another way, natural language is a whole that can be 
built up f r ~ m  parts. 
PHENOMENOLOGICAL LEVEL. This is a question of degree of 
explicitness. Here Schank s system is distinctive. Wilks's 
opinion is that the amount of detailed inference that a system 
may perform must be llmited not to go beyond 'commpn sense'.. 
As an example he mentioned Schank's analysis of the action of 
eating (performed by moving the hands to the mcuth) and de- 
1 scribed it as Ugoing too far from the meaning' of eating, 
whatever that may be, towards generally true information 
about the act which, if always inferred about all acts a? 
eating, will carry the system unmanageably far. . . . There 
clearly is a danger of taking inferences to a phenomenological 
level beyond that of common sense," he concluded. 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 55 
DEGOUPLING. The issue is whether the actual parsing of 
text fnto an understanding system i s  essential.. Charniak and 
Minskr believe that this  initial parsing can be decoupled. 
In Wilks's opinion this is not so, because he belkeves semantic 
analysis to be fundamental and because many of the later infe- 
rences would actually have to be done already, i n  order t o  have 
achieved the initial parsing. Also the problem of systematic 
ambiguity may be met much more e f f i c i e n t l y  w i t h  a system that 
does not decouple the parsing from r he  inference procedure. 
AVAILABILITY OF SURFACE STRUCTURE. In first and second 
generation systems it is generally accepted that word-sense is 
a. 
closely associated w i t h  the surface structure of the sentence, 
but Schank has made a point of the-nonavailability of the 
surface structure, on the grounds that an i d e a l  representation 
should be t o t a l l y  independent of the input surface structnre 
and words. In connection with this claim of Schank's, Wilks 
pointed out two things: in many cases the order of the sentences 
in .a  text is part of its surface structure, and this information 
should be available in some way. The other point conceined the 
form of =epresentation employed Wilks was not sure that a 
structure of primitlves. is sufficient for specifying and distin- 
guishing word senses adequateLy without transferring information 
specifically associated with the input word. 
APPLICATION. This concerned the way in which different sys-  
tems display, in the structures they manipulate, the actual 
procedures of application-of those structures to input text or 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 
dialogue Here the most distinctive. system is that of Wfnograd 
where the procedural notation, by its nature, tends to make 
clear the way in which the structures are applied. In h i 6  view, 
as stated in some of his more recent writings, the control 
structure of an understanding program is itself of theoretical 
significance, for only with a control structure, he believes, 
can natural language programs of great size and complexity 
remain perspicuous. 
FORWARD INFERENCE. IS it neaessary to make massive for- 
ward inferences as one goes through a text., as Charniak and 
Schank do, or can one adopt some laziness hypothesis' about 
understanding and generate deeper inferences only qhen the 
system is unable to solve, say, a referential problem by more 
superficial methods? Charniak's argument is that, unless for- 
ward inferences are made during the analysis, the s y s t e m  will 
not in general be able to solve ambiguity or reference problems 
that arise later. Wilks had some theoretical difficulties. tn 
arguing against this  v i e w ,  and he admitted the d i f f i c u l t y  of 
defining a degree of forward inference that aids the solution 
of later semantic problems without going i n t ~  unnecessary depth 
THE JUSTIFICATION OF SYSTEMS. Finally Wilks tried to 
contrast. the different modes of justification implicitly 
appealed to in terms of the power of the inferential system 
employed, of the provision and"formalizatfon, of a system's 
actual performance, and of the linguistic or psychological. 
plausibility of the proffered system of representation. 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 57 
In his conclusion Wilks concentrated on those areas where 
the greatest problems within the field of A1 are found. The 
following needs seem to be the most pressing ones the need 
for a good memory model (stressed by Schank), the need for an 
extended procedural theory of texts and for a more sophisticated 
theory of reasons, causes, arid motives for use in a theory of 
understanding. Wilks ended his survey by stressing the fact 
that there is an AI paradigm of language understanding which 
embraces first and second generation approaches and goes back 
to a considerable amount of earlier work in computational 
linguistics 
INFERENCE AND KNOWLEDGE - Eugene Charniak 
Why do we make inferences? We do when w e  use language and 
when we decode the information conveyed by language, i . e. in the 
case of structural disambiguation as well as in word-sense dis- 
ambiguation, reference determination, question answering, trans- 
lation, s m a r i z f n g ,  etc., everywhere a thing not stated expli- 
citly has to be assumed. In so doing we are looking Eor a piece 
of information, for knowledge beyond the given text or situation 
Charniak poses five questions about how knowledge is used to 
make inferences: 
1 What c o n c e p t s ,  and in w h a t  combinations, d o  w e  
need t o  record our impres s ions  of t h e  w g r l d ?  
(semantic representation) 
2. Under w h a t  circurnstanees and why  d o  we make 
i n f e r e n c e s ?  (inference tr ipger ing)  
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 58 
3. How do we 1ocate.the needed i n f o r m a t i o n ?  (organization) 
1, 
4 .  Once l o c a t e d ,  how do we know how to vSe the information? 
( i n f e r e n c e  mechahism) 
5 .  @hat is the k n o w l e d g e  that we have of the world that 
enables us to understand language? ( c o n t e n t )  
After this program had been put forth, Charniak presented ~ w w  
partial answers to the questions the  first orde r  predicate 
calculus (FOPC) and the p r o g r a m i n g  language PLANNER. 
FOPC consists of a+ language for expressing facts and rules 
for deriving new facts from old. The language consists of 
constants, variables, predicates, functions, logical connectives, 
and quantifiers. There are rules for inference. Charniak then 
outlined RESOLUTION THEOREM PROVING. It is a system for setting 
up proofs for dec id ing  which rule of inference to use. Charniak 
proceeded to look a t  the five questions he h a d  set forth and 
examined what answers. FOPC provides to them. He concluded that 
FOPC is primarily a theory ot inference mechanism,, but that it 
says very little about semantic representation. As FOPC dogs 
not tell how one is to locate the facts which are to be used 
to prove the derived result, theoretically we come up against 
a huge amount af possibilities when we combine the number of 
p o s s i b l e  clauses.with the number of possible resolutions. This 
is called the "combinatorial explosion'" and is a serious problem 
in most inference systems, not only far FOPC. 
Charniak then examined the ~roblern of when we make infe- 
rences. There are two obvious occasions when we may make one: 
TUTORIAL O N  COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 
1. When a question is asked which requires an 
inference to be made (question time) 
2. When the system has been given edough input 
i-nformation to  make t h e  inference (read time) 
Although the inference making r e s t r i c t ed  to question t i m e  would 
seem to be more ,economical since inference . is  done only when we

must, in oraer to answer the system user's question', there is 
some ovide~ca that inference is done at reading t i m e  ( e . g .  psy- 
c h ~ l o g i c a l  experiments on recall of texts). Furthermore, it is 
not possible to do word sense or steuctural disambiguation. 
withovt making inferenc-es. Wilks makes a d i s t i n c t i ~ n  between 
'broblem occasioned" and "nonproblem occasioned" inference. A 
typical example of the latter i s  given i n  -"Janet shook ner 
piggy-bank. There was no sound.. " We assurnel that there is 
nothing In the piggy-bank although the problem has not yet 
arisen in the story. Charniak believes that to do question 
answering on complex stories the system must perform nonproblem 
occasioned inference. ne glves examples rrom children's stories 
where persons lie about things and where the system has to.guess 
why the person is lying 
An alternative t o  FOPC is t o  use the natural p r o p e r t i e s  
of some programming language to make inferences. Bertram 
Raphael (1968) did this .ih the system S I R  when he used LISP to 
construce a data base. Another way is making the programing 
languagesmore suited to the needs of inference making. Such 
a system has t&rl designed bu t  not implemented: PLANNER 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 60 
( H e w i ' t t  1969)  I n  this system we are able to pick up an 
assertion by knowing parts of it If no appropriate assertion 
can be made, we can t r y  to have theorems ( i . e .  programs) 
investigated An antecedent theorem i s  one where w e  are given 
the antecedent and'we assert t h e  consequent, while w i t h  a con- 
sequent theorem we are  asked to p-row the coasequen-t and we 
try t o  f i n d  the antecedent. PLANNER has the a b i l i t y  t o  choose 
which theorems t o  use on the basis of the i r  patterns. This is

can back up to see if any earlier choices night be changed. 
This feature is somewhat controversial, since it might encourage 
the construcLi0n of programs which depend on b l i n d  search. 
PLANNER'S advantage over FOPC is that it offers several built-in 
organizational features, tne primary one being pattern directed 
invocation. A disadvantage about it as t heory  of knowledge and 
inference is thar: it is too vague Charniak (197.2-) illustrates 
the pros and cons of PLANNER using children's s tor ies .  Given 
a piece of simple narration, the system should be able t o  
answer reasonable quegtions about it. Charniak Stresses the 
need for looking ahead in t h g  story to make inferences  For 
this he uses. an anteceden~ theorem or a "demon". The routines 
which are  available to set up demons he calls ensE ROUTINES. 
In addition- he makes u s e  BOOKKEEPING f o r  updat ing the as-

nssert t h e w  and store them in the data base.. The main advan- 
tage of this system is that it provides a good theory of 
srganization. It states in particular that "given a particular 
assertion. the way we find those facts which we should use to 
nake inferences from the assertion is to 'look in two places-. 
first the base routine for assertions of that form, & second 
for any demons.which happen to have been activated which are 
looking for assertions of that ford" '  Charniak concluded his 
lectures by examining the recent works of three scholars: 
1. McDermott ' s system TOPLE (1.974) is rnalnly concerned 
with the problem of 'beliefs, describing a simple world con- 
sisting of a monkey and an experimenter in a single room. The 
program listens to a present-tense account of what is happening 
in the zoom; it tries to understand why things happen and what 
can be sxpected to happen as the story poas on. It tells us a t  
t.he end of every sentence what new assertions it has assumed 
as a rbesult of hearing. TOPLE's restrictions are the following: 
it does not answer questibns, it does not handle actual natural 
language but rather a formal-looking input language. On the 
otrrer hand, it tries to visualize concretely a situation. It 
is based on a "multiple wo.rld structure" 
2. Rieger (1974) is the first to have attempted to use 
Schank's conceptual dependency theory within a theory af infe- 
rence and knowledge. Rieger!~ program has as its main purpose 
tc make reasonable inferences from the input it is given. The 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 62 
input i s  expressed i n  a suitable formalism, i.e. conceptual de- 
pendency representation. It is also designed to understand 
stories, engage in dialogues, figure out references and word- 
sense ambiguity, answer questions about the way the world 
normally is 
3. Minsky ' s (1974) frames are reinterpreted by Charniak 
as "a collect-ion o r  questions to be asked about a hypothetical 
situation. Frames specify issues to be raised and methods to 
be used in dealing with t h e m .  I t  
Charniak also gave a double lecturn on SYNTAX I N  LINGUISTICS. 
This was an introduction t o  generative g r a m m a r  for those who had 
not had a. formal course in linguistics. 
MEMORY MODELS - Greg W -  Scraqg.  
After introducing SEMANTIC NETS, Scragg discussed t h e i r  
most important properties and compared several systems indlud- 
ing some with partial semantic nets, some with partially 
quantitied semantic nets, some with fully quantified semanttc 
nets, and some with executable semantic nets. 
He compared semantic net representations and predicate 
calculus tepresentations. 
Attempts to construct proofs in the predicate calculus will 
show the difficulty CXE sklecting the relevant infqrrnation for 
making a par t i cu la r  deduction f r o m  a specif-ic fact. The tech- 
niques currently employed in theborem proving programs are even 
less efficient,a.t selecting the most relevant material. 
TUTORIAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 
In comparison 3f predicate calculu-s and semantic nets, 
most problems center around the question of quantification. 
How does one quantify relations in a semantic net? Scragg 
mentions three different approaches. 
1. There are six possible quan~~ficatio~s fur a two-place 
predicate Pxy 
vxv yPxy , ZxVyPxy , 3yVxPxy, Vz3yPxy, *VyIIxPxy, 3?$3yPxy 
In Scragg (1973) the claim is made that #the first three forms 
are so rare in everyaay (nonscientif?~) s-ituations that they 
may be ignored. The rematning ones may be distinguished with 
a type-token flag. 
2. palme (1973) tries to represent quantification by 
introducing a third quantifier, ITS (meanins spme-thing like the 
possessive pronoun "its"). With three quantifiers, he now cam 
define six separate  relations for each pwvious relation: 
Quantifying with FOR-ALL or EXISTS on the Left and FOR-ALL., 
EXISTS, or ITS on the r-ight of the old relation. One disadvan- 
t age  of t h i s  i s  that he potentially has six times as many 
relations to work with and has to keep erack of the relationships 
between each of the six versions of the same-relation. 
3. Schubert- (1975) treats quantifiers in a different way. 
He first puts the predicate calculus representation of the 
statement into SKOLEM FORM (a form which has no existential 
quantifiers and with all- universal quantlfiers outside 05 the 
body of t h e  express-ion), Any node that is existentially 
TUTORItAL ON COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS 64 
quantified but dependent an a universally quantified node is 
connected to that governing node. An event is asserred if and 
only if there is no arrow pointing to that node in the diagram. 
The semantic net structures here tend to become very complex. 
~---~~"--""--------"----"""""i.iiiiii"iiiiiiiii" 1 .., a"". - . .. ." .... .- . -1 - I - - . . - ---- .. .L . . . . . - - d l " .  .----- 
It is not clear that any of the three approaches give 
really practical (or int~~tively satisfying) results. 
What we need at present is a theory of more conplex actions. 
For example, how do we link the descriptions of the various 
substeps of the pro.cess of cake making into a single desciiption 
of the overall action of making a cake? 
There arb those who claim that a l l  knowledge is stored in 
the form of procedures and there are those who clraim that it is 
stored as a collection of facts. 
Scragg ( 1 9 7 4 ;  see also Nonuan 1973 and Norman et a1 1975) 
takes an intermediate approach by making use of ambiguous (data 
or procedure) representat-ions to store information about actions. 
The system knows how to simulate various human actions-such as 
toasting bread, making spaghetti sr cleaning up the kitchen. 
The information a b ~ u t  how to perform these siinulatibns is: 
stored as procedures. However, these procedures can be used 
as data by other parts o f  the system to answer such questicms. 
as "'HOW do you make a ham and cheese sandwtich?"., "How many 
utensils do you use if you make a mushroom omelette?" o r  
"Why did Don use a knife?"

SEMANTIC MARKERS AND S E L E C T I O N A L  RESTRICTIONS. Phillip 
Hayes discussed in detail the influential paper by Katz and 
Fodor (1963). He concluded that the i r  semantic theory is n0.t 
qufte adeouate even for the purely linguistic system they try 
to outline.  everth he less, it can be a useful component of an 
A 1  theory of natural language comprehension. 
GENERAT~IVE SEMANTICS. Margaret King outlined the defining 
characteristics.of this theory and then concentrated on its 
relationship with AI. As a conclusion, she stated that the 
definition of grammar logically should be extended to embrace 
not only wellformedness and semantic acceptability but also all 
possible aspects of the context of use of a sentence. This is 
contradictory to the traditional view of grammar-understood aF 
the sole means of determin'ing which sentences are grammatical 
for the majority of speakers of the standard form oE the 
language. 
CASE GRAMMAR. Wolfgang Samlowski snrv-eyed- Fillmore's 
theory  with special reference to Its -intLuence on American 
linguistic theories of semantics and on leading researchers 
within AI. The survey consisted of a presentation of case 
grammar, an examinatlon of some explicit and implicit traces 
lett in A1 by the C a s e  grammar theory, and a demonstration of 
some of the complications that the acceptqnnre of the case

DIVERSE 
PHILOSOPHY of= LANGUAGE. Yorick Wilks, in a double lec- 
ture, compared and contrasted modern philosophy with relation 
to linguistics, in particular systems of formal logic, repre- 
sented by the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Richard Montague. 
The survey had special reference to t h e  application of such 
systems of formal logic to the preparation of language under- 
stanalng system-s. 
PSYCHOLOGY O F  LANGUAGE AND MEMORY.: Walter Bischof gave a 
se l ec t i ve  historical survey of the prevailing concepts in the 
field: association, organization a? data, Gestalt, meaningful- 
ness of data, temporal structure of memory, reaction-time 
paradigm to investigate semantic memory and the network models 
of representation as proposed by C.ol'15ns and Quil l ian  (1969) 
Recent work based on the same assumption has shown that the 
structure of semantic memory is not quite the logical, bier.- 
archical and economical structure proposed by Collins and 
Quillian. Bischof gave a list of possible relationships between 
artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology and concluded 
that these two disciplines have Little to say to each other be- 
cause of their different aims and because the available experi- 
mental tools proposed by psychology are too poor. 
LISP. Margaret King taught an "0-level" course and Philip 
Hayes a more advanced introductory course, to this programming 
language, which is being used widely by AT researchers, in its 
original form or in some of its extensions (CONNIVER, PLANNER).

TUTORIAL GROUPS. Work consisted of discussions between 
participants in smaJler groups and one or two of the lecturers 
Some evenifig lectures were given by the participants. These 
included H. H a r r e l l ,  R. Giintermann, and G. Zifonun, who pre- 
sented ISLIB ('information System on a Linguistic Base), a sys- 
tem for answerifig questions to an input  i n  restricted German, 
carried out at-.the Institut-fUf aeutsche Sprache at Mannheim. 
A. McKinnon 3f McGill University, Montreal. discussed his work 
on the Kierkegaard indices. Some lectures caused vivid dis- 
cussibn. For example that of V. V. Raskin, Hebrew University, 
Jerusalem-, advocated corpus dependent semantic.models and re-  
commended h i s  own "f,estric~ed sublanguages" 
APPRECIATION 
Altogether, tne tutorial in Lugana was very inspiring and 
profitable for the participants. It was well organized and 
gave good opportunity for discussions. The teachers in the  
t u t o r i a l  being f a m i l i a r  w i t h  each o t h e r ' s  work succeeded i n  
giving a comprehensive v i e w  on the topic of computational 
semantics. some or us ,  . h o w e v e r ,  felt a need f o r  more precise 
definttions of standard notions, this being a very acute prob- 
l e m  in view-of the heterogeneity of the participants' backgrounds. 
We are, however, aware that this is an inherent and recur r ing  
problem at such gatherings, where people with different qualifi- 
cations meet to dis-cuss comon problems We would l i k e  to ex- 
press the wish tha-t the Fondazione dalle Molle w i l l  be able to 
arrange more tutorials of a similar kind in the future.

LINGUISTIC RELEVANCE O F  SYMBOLIC INSERTIONS 
Respunsa Project 
Bar-Ilan Universi ty 
Ramat-Gan, Israel 
Some difficulties in automatic analysis ~ n d  transla- 
t i o n  bound to symbolic insertions in mathematical t e x t s  are 
discussed. Rules dealins with these d i f f i c u l t i e s  a r e  pro- 
posed, These rules  are based on the use of the whole t e x t  
of the a ~ C i c l e  incorporating a formula.  
For satisfactory automatic analysis of texts, it is 
necessary to provide in the dictionary exhaustive serrianti- 
cal Information ascribed to its entries. But t h i s  i n fo r -  
mation can a p p e a r  to be insufficient in cases where the 
meaning of! linauistic elements is ascribed to their occur- 
rences by t h e  very t e x t  in whlch they. a r e  encountered 
cf . I or example, pronouns. 
The o the r  example is provided by symbolic insertions 
in mathematical t e x t s ,  which we shall call 'If ormulaeN . 
So n o t  on ly  'a= b , 'X 2 Y '  e t c . ,  but a l so  
Ox* @ @ and so on are nforrnulaew. 
Mathematical formula resembles pronouns in one respect: 
it is semantically *voidqt being out of context. 
For example, @ G 9  may be * s e t H ,  " ~ u b s e t * ,  N~rouplt  , 
%peratorn, Mfunctim*, " s t r i ngw,  *elementu, 9qrule of 
grammarH, e t o .  
The meaning is ascribed ta a formula by the context. 
There are a f e w  types  of fo~mulae with f ixed meanings. 
F'or example, *dx/dyf I s  @derlVatlve8. B u t  this s l t b -  
t i o n  1s not  typical. 
One of t h e  basic usages of formulae conSist's of naming 
by formula A s o m e  individual object a belonging to 
s o m e  class b of objects such t h a t  there  exists  s o m e  noun 
block C l ( A )  that names b. 
For example, i'n the expression 'set R' the formula 
*R' names some individual s e t  belonging to the class of 
%etsN-. N o u n  block @seta (consisting in this case- of a 
single -noun) names this class. 
So here 
c ~ ( R )  = *sete. 
Consider some diff icultAes arising in translation 
because of the  absence in a source sentence of the Cl(f) 
f o r  a formula E.

(Syntactical links are also shown). 
At ^this point, the process of translation is suspendea 
because of the fact  t h a t  in Russian two non-coordinate 
formulae cannot depend on the s a m e  now. 
Similar examples are provicted by other languages:. 
German : In jeder Umgebung V von o X* . 
A human interpreter does not usually hesitate to 
properly translate such expressions only because he under- 
stmnds their meaning from a general background or vast 
context. We can point out some characteristic construe-- 
t ions  in mathematical t e x t s  that are sufficient as con- 
t e x t s  in such cases. Consider, f o r  example, such a con- 
text.(i.e. an expression From the same t e x t ) :

We deflne 3 and k by j = m + n; k = m - no. ( 5 )  
The "direct* translation of ( 5 )  to Russian: 
'Qpredeltm j i k putjorn j = m + n; k = m - n b

'Opredelim J i k s pomosh ju so~tn~shenij 
3 = m  + n; k -= m - n*, 
(*We ikefine j and k by correspondences j = m + n; 
k = m - n") is much better.  
~ l ( f ]  can be sometimes defined f r o m  the very formula

'Tous l e s  ensembles Li d indices lnferieurs

In this case we can reduce C1(L ) to only one word i 
*ensembles*. But in rare cases such reduction will pro- 
duce absolutely inadequate translations, 
Example t 
In the expression 
'Pour les fonctlons x ( t )  de Lg

(Cl(L) is underlined),

m i n d  tha t  the intersection of several s e t s  is also a

be questioned, 
Now we shall consider s o m e  p r o D l e m s  a r i s i ng  in trans- 
lation of Russian mathematical texts into European and 
other  languages. 
The construction 
in Russian has t w o  syntactical meanings, 
(a) appositive:, 
(b) genitive:' 
The cause of thls difficulty is the  omission of 
Cl(f) in r;ne surfaoe syntactical structure of s o m e  
Russian sentences: 
lpodmnozhestvo mnozhestva Bv- 'podrnozhestvo B p  
"SubseT (of 1 s e t  B" "Subset (of) B n .  
In such cases m e  qenitive link is rare ( 5 %  of 
n 
all occurrences of constructions of type N f, i . e m  
several-dozen occurrences in a mathematical article). 
The task of automatic cho1c.e here is very d i f f i c u l t .  It 
was solved o n l y  partially. We can c h ~ o s e  from the t e x t  
of an article about 70% of all occurrences of t h e  appo- 
s i t i v e  links and a l so  sowe occurrences of geni't-ive 
links, The rest of occurrences remain ambiguous. 
The proposed procedures w e r e  checked in exhausting 
manual experiments, hue their aaaptation f o r  computer is 
quite  feasible.  
C h o i c e  of appositive l i n k s  
Let us consider the following empirically stated 
ax h o m s  val id : 
( A  ) In t he  same Russian t e x t  every t w o  different 1 
occurrences o f  t.he same expsre,ssion of type 
. 
- N f are or both appositive or both 
So, if we have s-ucceeded in clarifying the meaning of a 
link in one occurreme of a construction, we can ascribe 
this meaning to every occurrence of t h e  same construction. 
( A ~ )  In a.construction of the type  
where fl and f2 are two syntactt;cally co- 
_T 
~rdinate formulae, the t w o  l inks  are  both  
appositive or both qenitive. 
For example, havirlg a construction 
( " s e t s  A and BH or '@se ts  of and 13") 
and knowing that in 
'mnozhesf va Am 
t h e  link is appositiye, we can consider t h e  link in 
*mnozhestva Be 
to also be appositive (1.e. "sets A and B"). 
( A  ) Let us call constructions of the type 3 
f jest' N* 
and 
*oboznachim N cherez f *  
( I * ~ e t  us desiqnate N by f") 
introductory construotions. Every introductory construc- 
tion ascr-ibes the meanizg to the formula which It in t ro-  
duces. 
n 
In every construc,ti.on N f, for which m. lntro- 
ductory construct ion exists i n  the same t e x t .  the 
( A  ) Sometimes the meaning is ascribed to a formu- 4 
la without any introductory con.struction. 
The l i n k  in an occurrence r of a construction 
 
o f t  e N  f L f  t h e  expression 
f has not occurred in the t e x t  berore. r,. 
In this case the formu3.a f must also not occur before 
r as any coherent part (subformula) of some other formula 
F,  Because t -Re  meaning can be ascribed to a formula f by 
its place In F tsee above). Sut t o  use t h e  distinction 
between a coherent and a non-coherent part  of a formula 
(Cf. 'a + b' in '(a + b)/d8 and in 'ca +bd9), we need 
a calculus of' all mathematical symbolic notations, of which 
only small portions exist (Cf. arithmetic expresssionS 0f 
prograhming languages ) . Becaus-e of this Ah was formu1.a- 
ted in the above form). 
(A ) Sometimes there  occur in mathematical t e x t s  5 
expressions where verbal and symbolic parts are interwoven 
so that irl syntactic analysis a s-ymbolic insertion appears 
no t  as a single unit but as a complex construction having 
i t s  own struct'ure. Some p a r t s  of tr formula can have links 
of their o m  wish t h e  external verbal parts of the sen- 
tence.

The sentence Can be read as' 'F.unction L b e l o n ~ s  to

"Function LO H(R) is defined by*... ) 
Here @ H ( R )  @ is an attribute of *Function9, and @t9 is 
an apposition modif-ying the same word. B u t  the whole 
string L E H(R) can a l s o  be corlsidered an apposition 
modifying t h e  w o r d  'functioh' . So, w e  can formulate a ru le :  
m If the link in some construction of t h e  type N -A f I s  
apposiCt;'ve, then the link of t h e  same N w i t h  the formula

a.c,C.f.% or 3. and f! is a (coherent) p a r t  of the 
formula f R f' Ls a l s o  appositive. 
The  inverse also holds t r u e .  
Using the axioms A1 to A5 c y c l i c l y  , we receive 
t h e  70% mentioned above. 
Example : 
Let us assume that the fo l lowing Russi.an expresslions 
belong to the  same mathematical tex t  (and the p r e l i m i -  
nary syntactical analysis has already been done): 
(I) @Oboenachim e tu  tsepochku cherea A' 
("Let us designate ths iS  s t r ing by A" ) ; 
( 2 )  'tsepochki A i B = D @  
("strings. A and B = p"? Strlngs of A and 
B = D"?); 
( 3 )  tsepochki B 1 F' 
("strings B and Fw? "Strings of 3 and F"?); 
(4 )  tsepochka F g  
("string Fg'? "Stride; of Fw?) 
U s i n g  axioms A 3 9  A=, A 2 9  kg* A19 Az and A1 we 
can ascribe the meaning "appositive" to the link in (4) .  
Assuming t h a t  In a t e x t  expressions (2), 3 and 
(4 )  are present, and thar; the occurrence of @ in ( 4 )  1s 
the f1rs.t; occurrence of this formula, w e  Can ascri3e to t h e  
1 ink 
'tsepachkl A' 
in ( 2 )  the meaning "appositive" with the a i d  of axioms A4, 
A1 A ,  A5 and A2 . 
So, we receive f o r  expressio2s ( 3 )  to ( 4 )  translations: 
"strings - A  and B = DM; *stxings B and FH ; *string F* 
It is worthwhile to mention t h a t  the same formula 
may occur in a t e x t  being linked appositively to several 
d%ffe,rent n o m s ,  for example, 
and 'mno~oobrazi je it (l'manlfold a R* ) . 
-f Different N in expressions of t h e  type N 
(with the s a m e  f) can r'ef'er to each other as genus and 
species or can name obdects f o r  which the  f a c t  of their 
identlty has been proven in the t e x t .  Using tho  axiom A4 
we can (very r a r e l y )  make an error. An error can occur in 
a case where the f ~ r m u l a  has the meaning specified once 
and f o r  all independently from t he  text .  So, wit,haut any 
previous definition of the meaning in an introductory con- 
struction or in a construction w f t n  tne apposftive link, a 
formula can at once be linked ~ e n i t 1 v e l . y  to a noun. 
This situation is not  typical in mathematical 
t e x t s ,  Ih thls case we have a hieroqlyphio w o r d  (cf. '&', 
@ $ '  in common Enqlish) and n o t  a freely chosen notation. 
Such a word must be storea in the dictionary (wlth the 
8 4  
epecific m e a n i n g  ascribed to it). For example, 'dx/dyW is 
'derivativeq. 
Using Cl (f ) in every case of occurrence of e-yery 
formula, authors  of mathematical cexts  w o u l d  nake the above 
procedures unnecessary. The problem qf standardizing t h e  
lanquage of scientifFc publications is n o t  new, and in 
many cases some format of texts is prescribed. 
The problem of choos-ing occurrences of qenitive 
links in constructlons of the type N- f f r o m  the set

wanted to exchonga knowladga or who wished to 
concantlate on qne aroa of oloctronics to create Spe- 
cial lntorest Groups. The IEEE Camputor Society was 
formed to advdnco tho theory and the practice of com- 
puter and information processing techhbl~gy and ex 
change of technical informatlon among its members. 
The scope of the Society encompasses all asnects of

ematics to problems in industry and science Rccog- 
nizing the gap in a professional structulo where the 
ropid expansion of industrial research had crentod a 
need tot basic analytical thought and n6w mathemuti- 
cal methods, S-AM developed new media to br~dge 
this gap and foster the exchange of ideas among ali 
who are interested in theapplicatlons of mathematics 
Membership Requirements
