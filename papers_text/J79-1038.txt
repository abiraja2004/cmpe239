The procedures and the model d e s c r i b e d  herein are original; 
however, tjhey owe much tb i n s i g h t s  found i n  the work  of tws

grammar r e c o g n i t i o n  procedure depends on t h c  identlfica t i o n  of 
the ~ r e c i s e  function or semantic role that each noun phrase 
actant  occurring in a given sentence exhibits with r e spec t  t c p  
t he  verb of t h a t  sentence .  
By a s s i g n i n g  verbs--or, to be more precise, verb, senses-- 
to one o r  more paradigms ( , p e r c e p t u a l l y  and f u n c t i o n a l l y  
de f ined  surf ace con? igurations) , i t  becomes possible to determine 
algorithmically for every sentence the functional relation (e. g . , 
theme, causal a c t a n t ,  goal, source, l ocus )  t h a t  each noun phrase 
i n  the sentence bears t o  t h e  verb, thereby a s s i s t i n g  g r e a t l y  Ln 
arriving at a representation of the mearring of each sentence. 
A nuhber of verb paradigms such ae intrans Ltive, t rans i t ive  
and ergative Rre def ined .  Verbs belonging t o  the intransitive 
paradigm such a8 die, fall, go, etc. always  have subjects that 
function ae t%emes. Verbs belonging to the transitive paradigm 
such ae k i l l ,  -- read, -S eat  e t c .  have subjects that function as 
causal actants -. - and objects  that function as themes. The ergative 
paradigm, which is more complex, cons Fs t s  of change-of - s t a t e  
verbs such as  open, melt, increase, e tc .  If an ergative para- 
digm verb has both a subject and- an object, the subject is a 
causal actant and the object is a theme; however; if such a 
verb takes only a subject, then the subject functions as a theme. 
The paradigm membership of each verb sense i n  the data base i s  
determined and is recorded as a lexical feature of that  verb. 
The number o+ verb paradigms would ,proliferate almost in- 
d e f i n i t e l y  were it not for several devices, b u i l t  into the grammar. 
One of these d e v i c e s  is the reversal of transformations such as 
p a s s i v e  and interrogative so that  subject and object  functional 
relations remain the same as i n  active, declarative sentences 
Another such d e v i c e  is the recovery of noun phrase dssations 
such as  the one occurring in a sentence likel"John ate .  " In 
this case, an indefinite object i s  reco~structed and the 
traneitive paradigm feature o f  the verb eat remains intact. A 
-
th ird  d e v i c e  of thie nature is u s e  of a notion ca l l ed  incorpor; 
ation.  For exardple, a sentence srtch as "It is raining." w i l l  
be analyzed as having incorporated the theme subject r a in '  i n t o

"Rain is f a l l i ng"  gets rec80nstructcd and processed as an in- 
t rans i t ive  verb paradigm item. 
To overview the e n t i r e  procedure, we s t a r t  by parping the 
sprface structure of any given sentence. The  major c o n s t i t u e n t s  
a,nd parts ofi speech are i d e n t i f i e d .  Nokt, we determine the t y p e

and t ransform the w r d  order where necessary. Fol lowing  that

Verb Paradigms for Sentence Recognition* 
Preface 
For a number of years i n  the early 1970's the  U.S. Air 
Force sponsored research at System Developmefit Corpora t ion  in 
the  a p p l i c a t i ~ n  of n a t u r a l  language processing techniques to 
computer-aided i n s  t r u c  t i ~ p  (CAI)  . The purpose of t h i s  research 
was to increme t h e  o v e r a l l  effectiveness of CAI as an instruc- 
tional method, w i t h  particular emphasis on extending the s tudent 
computer interface to permit s tudent-generated f t ee  f o m  responses 
and queries. The research included experiments with  a deduc- 
t i ve  quest ion-answering s y s t e m  designed f o r  use in C A I ,  the 
modeling o f  the  behavior of a hypothetical tutzor, and lastly 
the computer e v a l u a t i o n  of c o n s t r u c t e d  s t u d e n t  responses ,  and a 
question-answering system driven by a dynamic model of the  CAI 
lesson content. The sub jec t  matter used in the project was 
intreductory meteoro logy- - spec i f i ca l ly  concepts relating t.0 the  
nature of p s e c i p i t a t i o n .

One of the goals  oP t h i s  C~mputer-Aided I n s t r u c t i o n  Project 
was the development of an efficient ~ e c o g n i t i a n  grammar that is  
as a imple and rcal is  tic as poss ib le  without s'tlcrif icing i n ' f o r  
mation c r i t i c a l  t o  semantic interpretation The primqry purpose 
of th i s  grammar was the analysis of student responges phrased 
in natural English- a necessary step i n  the  answer-evaluation 
process. This paper describes i n  a gene ra l  way the grammar re- 
cogn i t ion  model deve1ope.d as part of the CAI P r o j e c t .  
The model developed was based on the assumption that recog- 
nition grammars should be constructed quite differently 0-om 
production grammars ( e . ,  they are something o the r  than mere 
i n v e r s e  algorithms of pr.oduction grawars and involve certain 
questions of h e u r i s t i c s  t h a t  are no t  a? concern in  the  c o n s t a c t -  
ion of production grammars); t he r e fo re  an attempt was made to 
d e v e l o p  a unique model specif ical ly oriented to recognition tasks. 1

which is desc t ibed  in Winograd (1971) . The Culicover r acogn i t io

INTRODUCTION 
.I 
The problem we faced is, i n  general terms, the fo l lowing:  
Given (more o r  ' less) acoura te pareings of s tudents ' responses, 
how do we, as s i m p l y  as possible, automate the reconstruct ion of  
deeper, more abstract message representat ions that p e r m i t  us to  
make reasonable semantic in terpreta t ions?  This paper  out l ines  
the e s s e n t i a l s  o f  our solution to chis prohlern. The solution 
is described in terms of the surfaae structures and deep rep- 
resentat ions  of s i m p l e  sentences beaause i t  i s  eas ies  t to under- 
s tand  and eva luate  the solution a t  th i s  level. The f i n a l  s ec t ion  
will di9suss some complex sentence s-tructures and w i l l  demon& 
s tra t e  t h a t  the paradigma t i c  technique discussed in th i s  paper 
can be extended quite natural ly  to bandle complex sentences as  
wel l  a's simple sentences .  
Given an utterance t h a t  i s  a s i m p l e  EngLish sentence, or part  
of a s i m p l e  English sentence, t h e  grammar d r i v i n g  t h e  parser must, 
f irst  of all, be capable of r e c o g n i z i n g  constituents such as 
noun phrases, prepositianal phrases., f i n i t e  verbs or verb phrases,  
2 By 'verb phtase'  w e  mean not the full 'predicate' but only 
the root verb w i t h  i ts  tense marker and o p t i o n a l  modal and aspect-  
ual auxiliaries, e t c .

and adverbs or adverb phreaee i n  ehte surface str ing of mxds.  
The noun phrase preceding the verb phrase is referred to  as t h e  
surface sublect; and if there is one noun phrase following the 
verb, it is identified as the surface oblec t .  If two noun 
phrases fo l low the verb  phrase, there ,are o b j e c t s ,  i d e n t i -  
f i e d  as surface object1 end surface ablecr2 respectively. The 
vezb phraae, plus whatever fo l lows it i n  a simple sentence,  has 
traditionally been referred to as thg psemdicate; we s h a l l  be 
making. use of the term i n  this sense too; hotrwer, the  notions 
s w f a c e  subjeCp, sur face  verb phrase,' and ' sur face  objece(s )  
are the not ions  t h a t  are most c r i t i c a l  i n  the  development of 
our approach. 
Surface Subjec ts ,  Surface Objects ,  and Marked V s .  unmarked Noun

L 
All noun phrases occurr ing i n  Engl ish  sentences w i l l  be 
viewed as  ac tan t s  that bear a s p e c i f i c  f u n c t i o n a l  relation to 
the  verb o r  element of p r ed i ca t i o  i n  the  sentmenee.  These func- 
t i o n a l  relations (e.g., theme, causal actant,  locus, e t c . )  will 
be dfscussed i n  the n e x k s e c t i o n  of  the  p a p e r .  We v i e w  the 
i d e n t i f i c a t i o n  of the prec i s e  func t ions  t ha t  a l l  noun phrase 
ac t an t s  i n  a  given sentence e x h i b i t  t o  t h e i r  verb as  t h e  ba s i c  
problem of sentence recogni t ion.  English,  more s o  than languages 
such a s  German or Russian, tends t o  give r e l a t i v e l y  l i t t l e  d i r e c t  
i nd i ca t i on  i n  s u r h c e  s t ruc tu re  as  t o  what the funct ion of a 
given noup phrase in a sentence ls. This is because noun pbrases 
occurring ae eurface subj ec t e  and eurface ollj ec ts--with the rx- 
caption of oome pronominal and interrogat~se o r  relative dorms-- 
are c o m p l e t e l y  unmarked in English ( . they bear no i n f l e c t i o n  
that would exclude or eugges t a particular function) . Thus 
we may have a eentence with en unmarked noun pnrase as the sur 
face subject: 
( 1) The object  deecended. 
Surface Subj . 
The same unmarked noun phrase may occur as a single unmarked 
eurface object  (2) or aa one of two unmarked surface objects 
(3) : 
( 2 )  Jqhn saw the object  
Surface Surface 
Sub j . Obj .

Thus in sentences such as (1) through ( 3 ) ,  the o n l y  inform- 
a t i o n  we can use if we w a n t  t o  i d e n t i f y  the function of the noun 
phrases is: 
( 4 )  a) The o r d e r  of  the NP's w i t h  respect to the  verb 
( e  , subject and ob jec t  (if p r e s e n t ) ) .  
b) When two objects  are p r e s e n t ,  the order of objects 
with  respect t o  each other  ( e . ,  obj 1 or obj 
c) The semantic class  and syntac t i c  voice ( e  , a c t i v e /  
pass ive)  of the verb. 
In cases such as these, where the only  i n f o m a t i o n  we hevs 
about t h e  noun phrases i n  a sentence has t o  do. w i t h  t h e i r  ser ia l  
order, we s a y  t h e t  the noun phrases are  unmarked. 
T h e  surface subject  of any English sentence is, by d e f i n i t i o n  
always unmarked ( it is not preceded bg a preposition) ; 
however, it is p o s s i b l e  f o r  the o t h e r  noun phrase(s) i n  e sen- 
tence all to be marked e ,  preceded bv a  reposition) (5) , or 
fox the non-subject noun phrase(s) to be a combination of marked 
and unmarked noun phrases (6) :

From t h i s  point of view, m o s t  prepositional phrases are 
analyzed as marked noun phrases m our grammar, and the lexical 
shape of a preposition preceding the noun phrase usually gives us 
some information as to what function the following noun phrase is 
fulfilling in the septence. This $nformation is o f  a d i f f e r e n t  
order from t he  information sta ted  in ( 4 )  ; however, we b e l i e v e  
13 
t h a t  it must be fully tntegtated with such infamation if sen- 
tenc6es are to be meaningfully recognized. 
A t  the surface LeQel, then, we are in teres ted  in recognizing 
umerked nopn phrase@ and marked noun phrases ( i . ,  noun 
phrase$ preceded by prepositi~ns); ufi.thin the class o f  bmarked  
noun &rases we a l s o  d i s t i n g u i s h  surface sub j ec t s  from surfficc 
objec t s  in terms of their po8ttion with respect to t h e  verb* 
and where two surface o b j e c t s  occur, we number them o b j e c t 1  
an& ob jec t2  on a left-to-right basis. When marked noun phrases 
occur, special attention is given to the p r e p o s d t i o n  t h a t  p r e -  
cedes the noun phrase. The voice of the v e r b  p h r a s e  of  the 
sentence is also  recogn tzed  a t  the surface leve l .  None o f  this 
inform&tion, however, will direc t ly  cons titute t h e  d e e p  represen- 
tation of a sentence .  Exactly how th i s  s u r f a c e - s t r u c t u r e  i n -

The elementary funct ianal  r e l a t i o n s  in our grammar are t h e  following:

se mo'vamant, locatton,  ownership (change of l o c a t i o n  or e t a t e  
af ownirship) , class mecabership, e t c .  
The functional s e l a t l ~ n  causal actant  refers t o  tho person,  
o b j e c t ,  natural force ,  f a c t ,  or s t a t e  of a f f a i r s  e t c . ,  ths t; 
functions to cause o r  b r i n g  about the ac t i on ,  change, or s i t u a t i o n  
described or implied i n  the p r e d i c a t e .  In  a d d i t t a n ,  all nouns 
that  may fqnc t ior t  as the causal actant in a sentence  are  marked 
in the l ex icon  with the feature ( + p o t e n t ) - - d i r e c t l y  or by re-  
dundancy rules, following Chafe (1970) . Not all sentenpes 
w i l l  have a causal actant ,  
Where present, the locuC4 i s  the object  or being that  the 
'~herne is a s y n t a c t i c a l l y  and semantically defined fuactioflal 
reldtion introduced by Gruber (1965). We fo l low Grubet ' 8 cnpice 
of terminology and note  that a sirnilqr functional r e l a t i o n  was 
referred to  as the ' ~ b j e c t i ~ v e  case '  by Fillmore (1968b) and 
the 'neutral  case'  by the UCL4 English Syntax Project  (1968) 
4 ~ h e  functional relation locus includes under one category 
the two functional re lat ions  that ~ i l h a r e  and others have c a l l e d  
dat ive  and l oca t ive .  T h i s  i s  q a i n  more c l o s e l y  i n  l i n e  with 
G~ubor's a n a l y s i s  than w i t h  o t t e r  auai lable  analyses 
theme is  i n ,  a t ,  on, nea r ,  etc. Its use also implies that there 
rs no motion of t h e  theme being expressed in the sentence 
( i 4 e a p  the func tional relation ' locus ' typically occurs with 
s t a t l v e  predicates) . 
The two other elementary Eunctional relations that may in- 
teract with  themes, causal ac tants  and loci are the directional 
frmctLonal relatLons 'source' and 'goal'5--the n o t i o n  of source 
of  ten being marked by ttte use of the prepositions ' (away) frolh' 
' o u t  of', and goal being expressed by the prepositions ' to(wards) 
' i n ( to )  ' , and 'on(to) ' 
The following six sentences give several examples showLng 
how marked ahd unmarked noun phrases can b e  r e i n t e r p r e t e d  a s  one

LOCUS P heme 
5 ~ h e a e  functional relations have been used w i t h  great 
success by Gruber in h i s  lexical inves tigations (1965) . We 
see the need to employ these notions as p r i m i t i v e  functional 
relations i n  the type o f  gramar w e  have built. It is possible, 
however, that they should be treated a s  motional variants of

The basic  t y p e s  of sentences t h a t  we w111 discuss  s h o r t l y  
in terms of 'paradigms1 have, as a minimum requirement, one 
noun phrase funct ianing as a therbe; and at most, one occurrenc 
of any of the five functional relations described above. In 
o the r  words, a simple or b a s i c  sentence type w i l l  n o t  have two 
noun phrases functioning ag themes, or two noun phrases func-  
t i on ing  as causal actants ,  e tc. 
However, English has evolved a number of d e r i v e d  sentence 
t y p e s  where h r o  occurrences 0-5 a given  functional r e l a t i o n  are 
p o s s L b l e .  Consider the following sentences: 
(13) Hank broke the window. 
C . A .  Theme 
(14) A rock broke the wir~dow. 
C.. A . Theme 
(15) The n o i s e  broke the window.

In sentence$ 3 )  through (15) , the surf ace subjects , regard- 
less of semantic differences, ate functioning as causal actante 
in our analys ie .  It is only in sentence (16) where two causal 
ectante occur, that i t  becomes necessary to d i s t inguish  two 
kinds of causal actants: direct and indirect. 6 
Whenever two caueal actanta occur i n  an a c t i v e  sentence, 
the unmarked one in subject position is the obligatorily anim- 
a te ,  d'lrect causal actant  and the one marked by 'with' that 
occura later in the sentence is the inanimate t n d i r e c t  causal 
ectant. In Fillmore (1968b) and other caee-type grammars the 
preposition 'with1 hae of  ten been analyzed as indicating the 
inatrmental case--whl.ch w e  have reanalyzed as marking an ' in- 
d i rec t  causal actant. ' We feel  that 'with' does not  indicate 
any given functional relation consistently; rather one of the 
things Iwith' indicates i s  a derived sentence t y p e  having more 
than one occurrence of a given functional re la t ion .  In (16) 
'with' indicated en indirect  celleal actant.  In sentence (17),

' ins trument ' being some thing close t o ,  though not identical to, 
what we describe as direct and indirect  causal actants respect ive ly  
A given sentence may contain both types of causal actants- - in  
which case the direct cauaal actant is subject. If only one is 
present, i ts  direct or lndirect  status i s  irre levant;  i t  i s

Note t h a t  the co-theme i n  sentences such as (17) and the

S1 and the locus  of S2:

The fact  that two sentences are i n v o l v e d  in (19) is reinforced 
by a two-sentence paraphrase of s en t ences  such as (20) f i r s t  
suggested by Lees (1960) :

The error of assigning one semantic function to ' w i t h '  
(or to most other prepositions for t h a t  matter) i s  f u r t h e r  
emphasized by the  ambiguity inherent  in sentences such as the 
fbl lowing,  which have been discussed in another c o n t e x t  by

the f u n c t i o n a l  f e l a t i o n s  and syntactic and semantic featdzes of 
large c l a s s e s  of verbs. Then the only feature needed in t h e  
lexicon would be a s p e c i f i c a t i o n  of which ~ a r a d i g m ( s )  a given 
verb sense  belorged to .  
In  o t h e r  words, for verbs that a r e  like - die. (i. e.  , r e q u i r e  
a theme which occurs i n  surface subject p o s i t i o n  and do no t  per -

For  recognf t ion  purposes,  t h e  paradigmatic  f e a t u r e  i n t r a n s i t i v e  
tells us t h a t  the  s u r f a c e  subject i s  func t ion ing  as e theme, t h a t  
B causal actant i s  impos~ib le ,  and that any other  actant must 
be marked by an appropriate preposition. 
The v e r b  - k i l l ,  however,, is a membel' of. the transit ive7 
paradim which requires. both a theme and a causal actant. 
7 ~ o t e  the ~3i.f erence between our use of  the terms - tran-

uses. In traditlonal terms, ' transitivet means merely that 
a verb takes both a surface slibject and a surface object; in 
generative terms, ' transitive has meant. that a verb i capable 
of being passfvized. h nur system. transit ive means t h a t  a 
verb takes a causal actant surface subject and theme surface 
object in the ac t ive  voice. We s t re s s  this distinction because 
many of the verbs that allow. the passive transformation do not  
have causal actant subjects in t h e  a c t i v e  voice  (e.g. ,  Mary 
claw the men/ the men were seen by Mary .) . This i s  why we stress 
tha t  our use c>E the term transttive t : ~  describe the behavior 
of a particuLar verb paradigm is more specific and functionally 
odented  than other usages of the term. While i t  i s  true that 
a l l  of our [+transitive] verbs may occur in the pass ive  as w e l l  
as the  a c t i v e  voice, th i s  fact  is not e defining p r o p e r t y  of 
[+transitive] verbs in our system but a redundancy rule of s o r t s .  
Likewise, intransitive means not only that the verb takes a 
surface eubject and no unmarked surface object  but that th is  
surface subject is functioning as a theme. 
Furthermore, from the  recognition p o i n t  of view, we know that 
f o r  all verbs marked [+transitive] tho surface subject is t h e  
causal actant and tho surface o b j e c t  is t h e  thcmo iT tho ve'rh 
is in the a c t i v e  voice. 
A large class of verbs l i k e  open belohg t o  what we refer 
to as the ergative pbradigm. 8 'Ergative' i s  a surface s r a c -  
k r e  t y p o l o g i c a l  term long used by linguists t o  charac te r i ze  the 
grammar of those  languages that  seem to ass ign  t h e  same syntactic 
role or case to both the subject NP of an intransitive verb and 
the object NP of a t r a n s i t i v e  verb. ('Ifgo languages t y p i c a l l y  
described as ergat ive  a r e  Basque and Eskimo.) In the l i d h t  of 
this definition, the behavior of open and the other two verbs in 
the examples below appear to be 'ergative': 
(32) a. John opened the door. 
b .  The door opened. 
(33)  a. The heat melted t h e  i ce .  
b. The ice melted, 
(34) a. The pressure increased the temperature of  the air. 
b. The temperature af the a i r  increased..

We prefer this tradi t ional  term t o  Lakoff 's rwhet uncon- 
ventional use of the term ' i n c h o a t i v e '  i n  h i s  dissertation, - The 
Nature of, Syntactic Irregularity (1965), and elsewhere to de- 
scribe similar phenomena. 
What happens i n  thegs sentences is that if che causal actant  
subject of the (a) exemplee i e  preeent, it is the surface subject; 
and the surface object ,  which mu8 t also occur, is the theme. 
If no causal actant is present ,  the surface crubjec't is the theme 
end there is no surface object.  Also the verb ib an act ive ,  
d e c l a r a t i v e  English eentence mast, aa e rule, come second. 
Thus if there ie no causal  a c t a n t  present f i l l i n g  the eubject  
e l o t ,  the theme (or a noun phraae beating some other functional 
r e l a t i o n )  must f i l l  the subjec t  a l o t .  
There ere &any ergative paradigm9 verbs in English. In 
par ticu'ar, the vecabulary of the meteoro,logy lessons that our 
project was centrally concerned with contains many verbs belong- 
ing t o  t h i s  ergative paradigm (e.g. ,  move, (re)distribut@, re- 
duce, relate, replace, skew, s l a n t ,  spread (throughout), s t b r t ,  
a top,  decrease, transfer (in) to, weaken, break(up) , b o i l ,  begin,  
dry (out), dissolve, decompose, d i v i d e  ( i n t o ) ,  condense, form 
(out of), e t c . )  . 
9~orne readers will quest ion the need f o r  an ergat ive  par& 
digm and suggest t b t  each such verb be assigned to both the 
intransitive and transitive paradigms. However, both the 
economy gained by srating j u s t  one paradigmatic feature f o r  verbs

the relationship between raiselrose - 9  k i l l / d i e  a9 s u p p l e t i v e

s i t i o n .  However, there are a l s o  o large numhcr of pairs  of 
transitive-intransitive verbs that, by v i r t u e  oE t h e i r  sement ic 
(and sometimes phonologica l  or or thograph ica l )  s imilerity , should.

b. The r abb i t  d i e d .  ( - C . A . ,  - s t a t e )  
c . The rabbit is dead. (-C . A .  , *ate)

above is the same as in the (b) sentences--the differenoe between 
2 7 
them being thw statiw v s .  the nonstative nature of the verb 
phrase. Thie  d.iff$rence some-times has no effect  on the surface

three transfer paradigms. F i r s t  of a l l ,  there are t h e  two-way 
transfer verbs which allow ovest expression of both a source and 
a goal:

Secondly, there are source-subject transfer paradigms which p e r -  
m i t  goals but  not sources to be o v e r t l y  s t a t e d  i n  the p r e d i c a t e  
since the subject is the source of the transfer.

Somewhat similar t o  the transfer paradigm is the one-way 
pu t l t ake  paradigm that includes additive verbs like put i n ( t o ) /

In t h i s  paradigm v i r t u a l l y  all of t h e  verbs can be used in con- 
junction with ei ther  goals or sources--denoting the theme's corning 
to or going from a locus respect ively .  The prepos i t ion makes 
clear which case is intended. A few of these verbs even permit 
the expression of both source and goal i n  the predicate,  and 
these verbs form a separate two-way putjtake paradigm ( 4 4 ) :

There are several other  poss ib le  paradigms which w i l l  not be

Another type  of transformational deletion occurs with v i r -

ferent i n  that the surface subject i s  not o n l y  functioning as a 
theme but a l so  as a causal actant since no external causal ac- 
tant has been e x p l i c i t l y  mentioned. We can roughly paraphrase 
th i s  type  of sentence as fol lows:  
(51) a. John cawed himself  to run. 
b. The cat  caused itself to move.  
Since such paraphrases are not possib'le for the sentences in

( 4 9 1 ,  we assume that  a reflexive'  d e l e t i o n  takes p lace  in sen- 
tences with transitive-paradigm verbs of motion o r  verbs of 
self-oriented hab i t  (e .g . ,  wash, dress ,  shave,  e t c . )  When an

The accusative and r e f l e x i v e  d e l e t , i o n s  discussed above h e l p  
to explain an i n t e r e s t i n g  ambiguity t h a t  occurs in sentences 
such as (52) : 
(52,) Mary washed. 
which may have e i t he r  of the  i n t e r p r e t a t i o n s  in ( 5 2 ' )  d : 
(52 I )  a. Nary washed (the laundry)

o r i e n t e d  habi t .  
(i) John cut himself. 
(ii) Mary wore herself out .  
(iii) The dog prdte 'c ted  himself. 
Since the t r a n s i t i v e  paradigm verb wash w i l l  be marked in the 
lexicon as additionally permitting either the accusative dele- 
tion or the reflexive d e l e t i o n ,  the two ambiguous readings OX 
(51)  g i v e n  i n  (52)  will be automatically p r e d i c t e d  by the re- 
cognition grammar since the accusative de le t i on  rule w i l l  re- 
copstruc t (52a) and the reflexive deletion rule (52b) . 
In addition to deletions, the grammar recognizes and effec- 
t i v e l y  ' r e v e r s e s T  various movement transformations or permutat ions  
that may have  operated to  produce the surface structure of  cer- 
tain s e n t e n c e s .  
A well-known movement transformatibn is  the passive t r a n s -  
formagion which operates on a sentence such as (53) and produces  
( 5 4 )  : 
(53) Dick purchased the car yes terday . .  
(54) The car was purchased yesterday by Dick. 
A subsequent transformation may o p t i o n a l l y  delete the 'by'  phrase 
i n  (54) yie ld ing  ( 55 ) .  
(55) The car was purchased y e s t e r d a y .  
Given a sentence such as (54 )  our rules will 'reverse' the pas- 
sive transformation and y i e l d  (53). Given a sentence such as 
(55) our rules w i l l  reverse the p a s s i v e  transformation and p r o -  
duce aq a c t i v e  structure similar to  ( 5 6 ) .  
(56)  Someoae purchased t h e  car yes terday  .

the  corresponding a c t i v e  s e n t e n c e :

Of the above fou r  ' b y '  phrases,  o n l y  ( a )  could f u n c t i o n  as sur-

Another prob lem i n  passive reversal concerns  the verbs i n  
t h e  various t r a n s f e r  paradigms. For several  o f  these verbs most 
speakers  of English recognize two different passive permutations 
( e . ,  (59) and (60)) o f  the same active sen t ence  (58): 
Active (58) - John gave Mar the book.

Passive ( 5 9 )  Mary was a v e n  tHe book (by. John). 
(60) The book was given (to) Mary (by John). 
In such cases. semantic information about the surface subjects 
and surface objects of the p a s s i v e  sentences is required if the 
'theme' and the 'goal '  are to be properly  labered in the deep 
structure. In such caees tho fol lowing feature hierarchy--or 
something like it-+seems to operate: 
human 
animate 
(6 1) s ta tionary 
concrete 
abstract 
The two nouns involved a s  ' goal  ' and ' theme ' seldom are at the 
same level on the  hierarchy in terms of t h e i r  l ex i ca l  features, 
and the one that is higher thhn  the other is always the goal. 
Thus in (59) and (60) --irrespective of the surface order in the 
passive--'Mgryl is analyzed as peal and I t he  book as themo . 
Some readers no doubt may wonder why we have bothered  to 
write  rules that depassivize13 sen tences .  The answer is t h a t  
we wish to get  optimum eff ic iency and accuracy out of our  para- 
digms without indefinitely p r o l i f  @rating their  number. The 
paradigms are s e t  up t o  assign functional relations to the 
marked and unmarked noufl phrases occurring i n  a c t i v e  declarative 
s t ruc tures .  By first revers ing t h e  r e s u l t s  of deleti .on trans- 
format i o n s ,  question trans? ormations and other movement trans- 
formations (e .g .  p a s s i v e ) ,  w e  are  a b l e  t o  use a minimum nun\bes 
of paradigms t o  assign accurate functional l a b e l s  to a l l  o f  the 
noun phrases i n  a sen tence .  
The paradigms f o r  t r a n s f e r  verbs j u s t  d i scussed  above w i t h  
respect t o  the passive t r ans format ion  are also involved i n  
another movement transformation which w e  refer to 8 s  'goal f o c u s '  
13we are  for the moment ignoring potential ambiguities and 
changes of meaning caused by changes of quan t iF ie r  o rder ing  i n  
a c t i v e  and passive sentences such as those which Chossky has 
pointed o u t  (1965) . 
e.g. (I) Everyone i n  the room speaks two languages.  
(can be  I n t e r p r e t e d  as being d i f f e r e n t  languages 
f o r  each person) 
(2) Two languages are spoken by everyone i n  the room. 
etends to be interpreted as two specific languages 
t h a t  everyone speaks) 
To explain t h i a  transformation be m u s t  f irs t  establ ish  the 
difference between iumediate source8 and goals on the one hand, 
and remote sources and goals  on the other. With verbs of trans- 
fer ip the active voice, the surface subject is a source, goal, 
or causal a c t a n t ,  The theme i s  the surface object .  Other 
aspects of the motLon or transfer are usually impl ied .  The 
following examples illustrate t h i s  :

the subject expresses the function "goal, then the optional 
"for" phrase may express (remotely) e l the r  the funotion "goal"

O u r  grammar makes use of several other  d e l e t i o n  and mve- 
m e n t  reversiqg tr'ansf~rm~ationa that w i l l  n o t  be discussed horc. 
What we have tr ied to i l lustrate in t h i s  section of the paper 
is t h a t  b o t h  paradigms and transformations arc useful componen t o  
in a recognition g r a m a r .  
l%e have reascn to bel ieve  that an obj eo tivalization move- 
ment rule like Focus' in Eng1,ish is a l s o  w i d e l y  used i n  
other  languages. French,  f o r  example, appears to have a move- 
ment operation even more general than the goal-res tr ic ted 
o b j e c  tivalization transformation of Engl i sh .  It is for this 
reason that speakers of French say sentences such as "open me 
the door" when speaking English. English does n o t  permit the 
movement o f  "me" to object position in this sentence because 
"me" is a remote causal ac tant  or source and n o t  a remote goal 
In "Open the door for me. " In this sentence "(you)" is the 
1 1  immediate causal actant and source and the  verb open" belongs 
to the ergatiwe paradigm and not to the movement-transfer class 
of verbs. Thus the rules o E  English do not permit " ~ o a l  FOCUS" 
movement to a p p l y  in such a case.  
In the course of the development of this recognition gram- 
mr we noted that ccrmp1e.tive aspect ( . .  inference, of  com- 
p l e t i o n  ve. no inference of completion) sometimes serves to 
di$ t inguish high ly  similar verb paradigms% In such cases, both  
the lexical ahape o f  t h e  verbs end the prepoeitione, as w e l l  as 
the order of ectanta in the surface structure, p l a y  a r o l e  in 
signaling the presence of completive aspect. Recall the para- 
digm f o r  verbs of putting and taking (71) discussed earlier in 
the paper: 
(71) a. John put water in the pool.  lZ7X7 [-comp e ive1-e Goal 
took the groceries out of the bag. 
b e  W [ - c o m p l e t i v e ~  ~hemb Source 
Note that the verbs of the sentences in (71) are n o t  marked 
as having completive aspect: one cannot i n f e r  t h a t  the pool  in 
(71a) ie full of water nor that ' t h e  bag' i n  (7Lb) i s  empty o f  
groceries. There i s ,  however, another paradigm similar to the 
put-take'  paradigm but different from I t  i n  that a l l  of ite 
verbs indicate completive aspect .  We refer to t h i s  [+completive] 
paradigm aa the 'join-separate' paradigm (72.), which is t h e  para- 
dim to which the verbs fill and empty, f o r  example, belong. 
(72) a. J c h  f i l l e d  che p o o l  with water.

The sentences. in (72) --unlike those i n  (71) --do allow us 
to infer  that ' tho p o o l '  in (72a) is full and that  ' the bag' in  
(72b) is empty This is boceuse.varbs of joining--which m a r t

which mark t h e i r  theme w i t h  'of1--are elway8 [+crmplctioc] 
Other examples o f  j6ining verbs are:  f i l l ,  s u p p l y ,  p r o v i d e ,  
s tock ,  cover ,  presen t ,  f u rn i sh ,  p l a n t ,  smear, sprinkle, e tc . 
Additional examples of separating verbs are: rel ieve ,  empty, 
rob, deprive, withhold, rid, clear, drain, deplete, etc. 
Some English verbs--= well as being used to express the 
completive notions of joining and separation--may a l s o  be uged 
to express nm-completive activities such as putting o r  taking. 
This dual: function of the verbs has been the source of much 
confusion and unsatisfactory a n a l y s i s ,  and is a topic we should ,  
therafose, like to  pursue in some detail. I n  Rall (19165),  f o r  
example, t h e  following sentences were cons-idered more or less 
equivalent and thus relatable vi.a a transformational rule which 
considered the objec-c paint in (73) as basic and the objec t  
'wall' i n  (74) as der ived:  
(73)  John smeared paint  on the w a l l .  
(74) John srneare'd the w a l l  w i t h  p a i n t .  
F i l lmore  (1968b, p .  48) e-xplained these sentences by 
suggesting t ha t  bo th  'wall' and 'pint' were o r i g i n a l l y  supplied 
with prepos i t ions  reflecting the lorcatisre and ins t rumental  cases 
43 
respect ive ly .  This y i e l d s  'on t h e  Gall' and 'wlth paint' in the 
deep structure. Fillmore then analyzed the verb - smear as having 
the following property: whichever of the ttwo deep structure 
elements concerned is chosen as the ' d i rec t  object' ,  it must 
fall next to the verb and must lose its preposition. 
While more ar less agreeing with Hall's intuftion that 
'paint' is a basic 'objectv--in our system 'theme1--Ln (73)  and 
a derived'object' or d i s p l a c e d  theme in (74), we disagree with 
her implicit  assumption that sentences such as (73) and (74) are 
syntactically or semantically equivalent or the e x p l i c i t  pro-  
posal  that they should be related by a transformattional rule. 
We also disagree with Fillmore's decision to analyze 'with' in 
sentences such as (74) as an ins fance of the instrumental case. 
In our view, aspec tual differences between (73) and (74) c a l l  
for a different assignment of Jeep structure functional relations 
and necessitate the postulation of distinct paradigms. In our 
ana lys i s  the surface object  of (73) is a theme; the verb "smear" 
expresses an activity s i m i l a r  to " p ~ t t ~ i n g "  i n  (73) and ' the wall 
ie the goal of t he  theme ' p a i n t ' .  In (74) 'smear' is being used 
to express the completed joining of a d i s p l a c e d  theme--i. e .  , 
'paint1-- to the locus--i.e. , 'wall'. In other words, our SOB- 
ution w i l l  analyze verbs such as 'smear ' .  as belonging to two 
1 dirfererrt paradigms.. In one of the paradigms, smear' behaves 
like ' p u t r  and in the  other  it expresfses j o in ing  a f  a loca t ion  
and a theme. In this latter sense, the displaced theme is 
expressed optionally, though always implied as something present 
but unspecified if not overtly expressed: 
(75) a.  John smeared the wall with p a i n t .  
b. John smeared the wall. (Implicit: with something) 
( 7 6 )  a John filled the glass w i t h  water. 
b.. John f i l l e d  the glass.  ( I m p l i c i t :  w i t h  scitnething) 
In t h e  non-complbtivc sense of 'smear' where 'well' functions as 
goal, t h i s  'goal' element is o b l i g a t o r i l y  expressed and n o t  
d e l e t a b l e ,  
ran h i s  b r o t h e r  1 
(77) a. John smeared paint on the wall 
b. *John smeared p a i n t .  
Z ( in the box 7 
(78) a. John put the bohk j (over) thOre l 
b *John put  t h e  book. 
Verbs of joinibg and separating are not the only ones 
belonging. to a paradigm that signals completive aspect. T h e r e  are 
two paradigms for verbs of contact that a l s o  can be used as 
examples. F i r s t  consider  the non-completive contact paradigm 
stones at the wall. 
kicked Goal 
In sentences auch as those i n  (79), we cannot i n f e r  that the 
theme made contact with the goal;  w e  assume the theme moved 
toward the goal, b u t  we do not know whether contact  was -made. 
Contrast theee sentences with verbs occurring bn the completive 
contact paradigm (80) : 
(80) John {: } the wall with stones. K?r ombarded Locus Theme 
(i-comple t i v e )  
These sentences in (80) force us to infer  that the theme has 
made contact with the locus; no other interpretation i s  possible. 
In the two sets of paradigms d i s c u s s e d  above, some unusual 
phenomena have taken place. In those cases where the verb 
signals completive action, the surface order of ac tants in  
a c t i v e  surfaces is as follows: 
Surface Surface 
(81) Subjec t  Object Marked NP 
+ W? + I  NP 
[ t c o m p l e  tive] 1 + prelw 
C.A.  Locus Theme 
46 
This is n o t  ,the normal orde r  of elements. The usual surface 
order f o r  act ive  sentences conta in ing  B c a u ~ a 1  a c t a n t ,  a theme, 
and a locus is the fo l lowing:  
Surf ace Surface 
Subject 
& 
Obj ec t 
V 
Theme 
Prep  9 NP 
Thus is appears that  we g e t  completive aspect only when a locus 
occurs i n  the position where one wauld normally expect  the theme 
to  occur. 
This  hypo thes i s  is confirmed b y  a completive g a l ~ d i g r n  w i t h  
no unmarked surface objects that has a locus in subject position 
ins tead  of  a theme (83). This paradigm is similar  t o  the non- 
comple t ive  paradigm which has the  theme i n  subject p o s i t i o n  
(84) and foll~ws t h e  normal o rde r  of constituents f o r  sentences 
having o n l y  a theme and a l o c a t i v e  actant:  
(83) The a rden  is swarming with bees. *[+co13pletive] Theme 
are swarming i n  the garden. 
T erne [-completive] Ldcus (84 )  i? 
The meanings of t h e s e  sentences have been debated by Fill- 
more (1968b) and Chomsky (1972), among others. F i l l m o r e  a ss igns  
the same case represen ta t ion  t o  (83) and (@+) sugges tins t h a t  
there i s  a d i f ference  of focus with  perhaps some corresponding 
difference in cognitive content Chonsky p o i n t s  o u t  t h a t  t h e  
sentence8 are not synonymous--that in (83) the bees are neces; 
e a r i l y  a l l  over the garden but that in (84) the bees might be 
only around their hive.  In l i g h t  of our analyses of sentences 
(71) - (80) we suggest t h a t  both  Fillmore' e remarks and Chomaky ' 8 
remark8 are correct but indomplete. The functional relations 
exhibited by the noun phrases i n  (83) and (84) are the  same, 
the verb aspect ie different. This auggeets that there are two 
paradigme involved: a completive paradigm accounting for (83) and 
(85) , and a non-completive paradigm accounting for sentence (84) 
and similar eentences like (86) : 
Theme + verb + Locus 
-[ -completive] 
(85) a. Passengers are r i d i n g  in t h e  bus. 
b. Fish swim fn the stream. 
c.  Groceries were in the bag. 
Locus + verb + Theme 
[+completive] 
(86) a. The bus is sagging with passengers. 
b. The stream teems w i t h  f i s h .  
c . The bag bulged with groceries. 
With lexically different verbs and preposit ions as in (85) 
qnd (86) the two paradigms are e a e i l y  distinguishable. When 
there is lex ical  overlap i n  different verb penses as in (83) and 
(84),  the prepositions as well as semantic features will serve 
to distinguish [+completive] paradigms from [ -completive] paradigms

Note a l s o  that the sentence  below is  impossible:

The l e x i c a l  and grammatical facts cannot be expla ined wi th  maxi-

Another example of i nco rpora t ion  that  Gruber provides  con- 
c e r n s  v e ~ b s  co-occurr ing w i t h  the  p r e p o s i t i o n  - fo r . The verb  
want _. o b l i g a t o r i l y  r e q u i r e s  and i n c o r p o r a t e s  - 9  f b r  whi le  thd verb 
yearn requires but never incorporates - for.  The verb wish, how- 
ever, requires - for end allows both p o e s i b i l i t i e e  ( i s  incor- 
poration of - for is optional) . Gruber 's examples i l l u s t r a t e  this : 
(90) a .  John wants a book. 
b, *John wants f o r  a book; 
c .  *John yearns a book. 
d .  John yearns for a book. 
e. John wishes a book. 
d .  John wished f o r  a book. 
These verb-preposition co-occurrences would be very difficult to 
explain economically without making refereace to  the notion of 
incorporation. 
Likewise, i n  setting up the paradigms needed to account 
for a large number of  verbs i n  English w e  rea l i zed  that  cer ta in  
verbe could be best  described as belonging to a part icular  para- 
digm but, in addi t ion ,  incorporat ing a specific noun actant .  
For example, the paradigm describing source-subj ec t transfer 
verbe l i k e  ~ i v e ,  -S send sell, etc. can also include verbs like 
help, aid, Bupp 
- ort, e t c .  i f  we recognize that such verbs incor- 
porate the  theme but are otherwise exactly like the source- 
subj ec t transfer paradigm: 
Normal 
Source (91) - John the car to Mar 
Transfer Source sent T l i z i r d

(92) - John gave Mar the car 
Source d- 
Theme - # -

The f a c t  that  these incorporating verbs can be paraphrased as 
follows fu r the r  reinforces t h i s  a n a l y s i s .  
(94 )  - John gave to blsrv

The theme is n o t  the3 only actant  t h a t  may be incorporated. 
Another such example of incorpora t ion  i s  found i n  verbs such as 
%, c h a r t ,  graph, s t r a t i f y ,  etc,. which resemble two-way t r a n s -  
fer verbs like bring, trans.fer, take e t c .  except that  t h e  goa l  
actant has been incorporatad i n  t h e  verb Thus we have the 
regular two-way transfer paradigm: 
e 
(96) John 
and th'e goal-incorporating version of the two-way t ~ a n s f e r  
paradigm: 
(97) John the s t a t i s t i c s .  
Theme 
This analys is  is again reinforced by the possibility of  para- 
phrasing the goal-incorporating two-way transfer verbs as follows: 
(98)  Jdhn transferred the s t a t i s  t ics onto the 
causal Theme 
Ac tant  
Goal 
Once it is recognized t h a t  part of the l e x i c a l  d e s c r i p t i o n  
of a verb may .Include the fact  that it belongs to a particular 
paradigm but also that i t  incorporates a particular functional 
re lat ion more t y p i c a l l y  expressed by a surface noun, the para- 
digms w i l l  a p p l y  t o  many addit ional  verbs,  and thus many un- 
usual phenomena can be  explained more cons is tent ly  and adequately. 
Consider the verb 'surface' as i t  occl3rs in the two follow- 
ing  sentences--which on a superf i c ia l  level appear grammatically 
s imilar : 
( 9 9 )  P h i l  surfaced the treasure chest. 
(100) The men surfaced t h e  sidestreet. 
In eaob o f  these sentences the verb has incorpora ted  the 
noun 'surface' as an actant; however, in (99) the goal actant 
has been incorporated and i n  (100) the theme actant has. Thus 
the verb 'surface' is being used i n  two very d i f f e r e n t  ways 
The following paraphrases o f  the abave sentences will help 
c lar i fy  t h i s .

Such sentences are unusual because the  surface s u b j e c t  is a

Again, t h e  not ion of incorporat ion p roves  to  be use fu l .  I f  we

The related historical  fact  i s  that Engl i sh  sentences re- 
quire the verb in second position; thus verbs that for some 
reason (e.g. ,  incorpora t ion)  are without an overt nominative 
subject to function as theme have come t o  r e q u i r e  an empty i t '  
(referred t o  as the impersonal or e x p l e t i v e  - it) in subject

From the Surface Structure of a S i m ~ l e  Sentence t o  its Deer, 
Functional Structure 
In the  recognition grammar that we have developed, the 
f i r s t  s t e p  in making a cor rec t  deep structure a n a l y s i s  of a 
simple sentence i s  the surface grammar's parsing of t h e  noun 
phrase (8) , prepos i t ional  phrase(s) (i . e , marked noun phrases), 
the finite verb (phrase), and other possible surface structure 
constituents such as conjunctions and a d j e c t i v e s  or adverb 
phrases.  
A t  t h i s  poin t ,  it musf be e s t a b l i s h e d  whether the form of 
the verb bhrase) i s  act ive  or passive. The next s t e p  consists  
of looking up the surface verb in the lexicon to determine 
(i) what paradigm c lass  i t  belongs to and (ii) what movement and 
deletion operations may a p p l y  to the verb. 
Next, it ie poss ib l e ,  and in f a c t  very  simpla,  t o  taks 
each unmarked noun phrase and to ascer ta in  Nherhor i t s  sur facc  
structure r o l e  is subject  or object and to mark the noun phrases 
ancordingly . 
F i n a l l y ,  by using the l e x i c a l  information, a s e t  o f  
hnuristics i s  consulted to assign the proper  deep s t r u c t u r e  
functional r e l a t i o n  to each noun phrase occurr ing in t h e  sen-

Thus the recogni,tfon sys tem is conceptually complete as far 
as simple sentences are concerned, and col.nuplex sentences c m  also 
be handled, given oertain modifications that w i l l  be discussed 
b r i e f l y  in the  following sec t i o n s  . 
Extension of the Sys tem t o  Cowlex Sentences 
It would be impossible to r e v i e w  all our procedures con- 
cerning complex sentence t y p e s  in English; thus we s h a l l  merely 
exemplify our techniques f acus ing  mainly on inf i n i  tival--and 
marginally on gerundive-gsentential c d e m e n t s  in the process. 
Embedded sentences t y p j c a l l y  contain a number of optional 
and obligatory surface delet ions Which must be recovered. Re- 
cons truc t i ons  involve  those sub j ec t less predicates that are a 
result of deletion transformations taking place as part of the 
embedding process. For the sake of comparison, we have provided

movements of this t y p e ,  and sentences in (107) which have not .

The next t h ing  we must  do is c l a s s i f y  verbs  i n  such a way 
that  we can correctly f t l l  the  d e l t w  i n  a l l  of  the  above strut.- 
tures. Thus ins tead  of descr ib ing a verb as a ' subject -subjec  t 
de l e t i on '  verb (log), we will descr ibe  i t  as a 'copy s u b j e c t '  
verb - ( l l 3 h  so  w e  know t h a t  the  h igher  sub j ec t must be copied 
onto the d e l t a  i n  the embedded sentence i n  order  f o r  t h e  s y n t a c t i c  
deep s ' t tucture t o  be complete and accurate .  The following t a b l e  
shows how the features i n  our  recogni t ion grammar correspond to  
the  features that might b e  used i n  a genera t ive  grammar.

Once these features have been assigned t o  t h e  a p p r o p r i a t e  verbs, 
the t e n t a t i v e  deep syntactic structures can be f i n a l i z e d .  
There i s ,  however, one t r a n s  formation which must take p l a c e  
before  the  analysis of  embeddings beg ins ,  and this i s  the ' p a s -  
s ive- to-act iv .e l  t ransformat ion.  Thus a sentence such as (117)  
is f i r s t  changed t o  (118) before t he  embedding procedures a r e  
effected,  
(117) John was t o l d  t o  leave. 
(118) A told John to  leave. 
If this transformation were not carried o u t ,  a l l  f e a t u r e s  of 
ob j ec t-embedding- verbs would have to be re-analyzed in t he  
passive as fol lows:

While it would not be particularly difficult to change these 
epeci f icat ione ,  it seeme quite unnecessary in light of the Pact 
that de-paasivization must, in any caee, be done before the 
appropriate paradigm heuristic applies; thus it can eas i ly  be 
carried o u t  before embedding procedures a p p l y  as well. Para- 
digm analys is  then begine with the lowest ( i . e .  moat embedded) 
sentence in the tree and m'ovvo up with the result that an 
entire embedded sentence ( v i a  an intermeaiate NP node) is 
functioning as theme or causal actant in a higher sentence.  
The procedures outlined above fo r  dealing with certain  
types  of complex seritences--however p a r t i a l  and sketchy--  do 
indicate that it is p o s s i b l e  to extend the verb paradigm re- 
cognition technique to complex sentences, i . e . ,  i t s  use is 
n o t  l i m i t e d  to sFmple sentences. 
Concluding S tatemen t 
Although many d e t a i l s  have been omitted from t h i s  p a p e r ,  
we b e l i e v e  that such an approach i s  as linguistically and p s y -  
chologically v a l i d  as  other t h e o r e t i c a l  o r  pragmatic recognition 
procedures developed to date. Innovations i n  linguistics end 
psychol inguis  t i cs  such as Bever and Langendoen's use of "perccp- 
tual strategies , " which expla in  as well  as account for c e r t d i n  
I81n addition t o  the  automated IBM Recognition Gramar of  
Culicover, e t  ale (1969) and Winograd's work a t  MIT on P ro jec t  
MAC (1971), both o f  which w e  mentioned i n  the  i n t r o d u c t i o n ,  there 
i s ,  o f  course, a l s o  the Halle-Stevens "Analysis-by-syn t h e s ig "  
model (1964), which must be c o n s i d e r e d  as a candidate for a 
recognition-grammar model theoretically--even though Hal le  8pd 
S tevens  were concerned with  speech r e c o g n i t i o n  per - se .  Although 
we can see that  the "Analysis-by-synthesis" model is use fu l  i n  
explaining hallucinatory recons t ruc t ion  of speech and r e l a t e d  
phenomena, w e  feel that  n e i t h e r  their fully act ive  model (nor 
a f u l l y  pass ive  model for t ha t  matter) w i l l  prove t o  recon- 
s,ruct a c c u r a t e l y  t h e  complexities of normal human speech p e r -  
cep t ion  o r  to explain human language recognition and comprehension. 
65 
facts  of historical. syntax (1972) , tend to con? i r m  our working 
assumption, which i s  that there are perceptual cues in the sur- 
face structure o f  English that are critical i n  grammatical re- 
cognit ion.  We hypq thes ize  that these perceptual cues, when 
combined with lexical informatian and information regarding the 
patterned movements and deletion8 that take place in syntactic 
con? i s m a t i o n s  i . paradigms, trans? orma tions and incorporations) 
make up much o f  the "knowledge" that the speaker of a language 
gradually acquires and then uses in recognizing and understand- 
ing the sentences of his native language (or any language he learns 
and knows, for that matter). We are convinced that this know- 
ledge overlaps wLthY  yet  i s  somehow 3 different from, the knowledge 
and skills that are required if one wishes to produce grammatical 
sentences in a Language, 
Kelley (1968) , for example, has postulated that comprehen- 
s ion  is baaic  in language acquisition and that rules of pro-  
duction are no t  essential f o r  comprehension but may develop 
alongside o f  the necessary comprehension r u l e s  t o  s a t i s f y  other 
goals and purposes. If Kel ley's  model i s  correct, i t  indicates 
that human recognition graannars--an e s s e n t i a l  component of com- 
prehens ion--are , no t  mere inverses of human production grammars. 
T h i s ,  in turn, suggests that the most e f f i c i e n t  computer-based 
recognition procedures will be based, not  exclusively on gen- 
erative production- t y p e  grammars, but a l s o  on principles and 
66 
rules s imi lar  to those that  human beings would seem to employ 
expressly in language recognition ana ramprchcnsi~n. O n  t h o  
othe,r hand, the model a l s o  s u g g e s t s  that the most r e a l i s t i c  
tecognition procedure will overlap to a considerable  e x t e n t  
w i t h  a produc t i o n - t y p e  grammar--utilizing, in d i f f e r e n t  ways,  
a groat deal of tho same information. In the development of 
our recognition model, such psgchoZinguis tic c o n s i d e r a t i o n s  
proved to be aos t useful .
