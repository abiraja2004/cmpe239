Abstract 
User modeling is an iml>ortant COlnponents of dia- 
log systems. Most previous approaches are rule-based 
methods, hi this paper, we proimse to represent user 
models through Bayesian networks. Some advantages 
of the Bayesian approach over the rule-based approach 
are as follows. First, rules for updating user models are 
not necessary because up<lating is directly performed 
by the ewduation of the network base<l on probal>ility 
theory; this provides us a more formal way of dealing 
with uncertainties. Second, the Bayesian network pro: 
rides more detailed information of users' knowledge, 
because the degree of belief on each concept is pro- 
vided in terms of prol~ability. We prove these advan- 
tages through a prelinfinary experiment. 
1 Introduction 
Recently many researchers have pointed out that user 
modeling is important in the study of (tiMog sys- 
tems. User n:o<h!ling does not just render a dialog 
syst(,nl more cooperative, lint constitutes an indis- 
1)ensable l)rerequisite fin" any flexible (lialog in a wider 
<tomain\[9\]. The user models interact closely with all 
other components of the system and often cannot eas- 
ily be separated from them. For examph,, the inl)ut 
anMysis component refers to tile user's knowledge to 
solve referentiM ambiguities, and tile output genera- 
tion component does the same for h,xical el,oices. 
The con<:epts are usually explained l>y showing their 
relations to the other known concepts. Thus, for the 
<lialog system it is important o guess what the user 
knows (user's knowledge) in order to explain new con- 
cel)ts in terms of know,t concepts. For examl/le , con: 
sider that tit(, system explains the location of a restau- 
rant to the user. It might 1)e useless to tell the. user the 
position in terms of the Mlsolute <:oordinate system, 
since the user's mental model is not based on the ab- 
solute coordinate. Therefore, the system should show 
the relative location frmn the lo(:ation tit(' user alrea(ly 
knows. It is difficult to predict which locations the 
user, who l)erhaps is a stranger to the system, knows. 
Though the syst:em <:ouhl atteml)t o a('quire the in- 
formation l/y asking the user al)out her k,towle(lge, too 
many questions may irritate the user. Such a system 
is considered mechanical and not helpful. Therefore, 
tit(" system is required to guess the user's knowledge 
by finding clues in the user's utterance and to refine 
the user's model incrementally. 
In the user modeling component of UC\[5\], several 
stereotyped user models which vary the user's level 
of expertise were prepared beforehand and the appro- 
priate model was selected based o1: the user's utter- 
ances. Ill the approach used by Wallis and Shortlifl'e 
\[12\], the expertise h,vel was assigned to all concepts in 
the user model. The system guessed the user's level, 
and the concepts with the expertise level lower than 
her level are considered to be known by her. This 
n:o(lel can deal with tit(.' level of expertise more appro- 
priately than UC, because the system does not have 
to prepare the nmltiple user nlodels for each expertise 
h, vel. 
The approach of pr<.'paring several user models and 
adoptit,g one, however, is an al>l>roximation f user 
modeling. The expertise level of tit(: user is continuous 
and, in general, the unique measuremelfl: of expertise 
level is not appropriate for some domMns, specifically 
the domain of town guidance consi<lere<l in this paper, 
because the areas that  are known differ with the users. 
Another problem of user modeling is updating the 
nmdel as the (tialog progresses. At the beginning of the 
diMogue the system cannot expect the user nm<M to 
be accurate. As the diMogue progresses the. system can 
acquire clues of the user's knowledge fl'om his utter- 
anees. Also, the system can assume that the concepts 
mentioned are known to the user. Thus. updating the 
user model shouhl 1)e performed incrementally. 
One difficulty of updating user nmdels is dealing 
with uncertainties. The clues that  can be obtained 
from the user's utterances are uncertain, the iltfol'nla- 
tiol( may conlli<:t with what has been hi,rained, and, as 
a result, the user mo<lel may be revised. The effects of 
the systtnn's explanation are also uncertain. Further- 
more, reasoning about the user's kuowledge must be 
performed Oil the basis of uncertainties. Most previous 
apl)roaches to this prolflem are rule-based metho(ts. 
Cawsey \[2\] sorted the update rules in order of their 
reliability and applied them in this order. In another 
approach, tit(., mechanisnl such as TMS\[6\] or nomnono- 
tonic logic\[l\], is used to maintain the consistency of

We haw; said the nodes ill the \]l;tyesian etwork are 
F~Lntl{)lll v;triables that  r~tltge over sol,le vahles. In ol 'del '  
to represent knowledge in terms of the l~tyesi~m net> 
work, we must  design the l~ulgllage for the seutt.'nt:es 
assigned to the nodes of the network. We th'st as- 
sume t.ha.t the v,u'iMfles haw'. two lmssible values, so 
\[:hat h?'. sentt'.uces have t ru th  wtlues, tlutt is, :1. (trl lc)

The type of sentences may deI)end on tit(: applica- 
tion we pursue. For general explanation, it is impor- 
tant to make a (:lear distinction between tile two user's 
states; knowing tile name of a conceI)t and knowing the 
other attril>nte of tile coucel)t. For example, suppose 
the user asked the following: 
"Where is FRISCO ?" 
where FRISCO is the name of a record store. From 
this question, the system infers that the user knows 
the name of the store, but does not know its location. 
Now we will give a precise definition of our language. 
All the sentence, s in the language have the form 
( la, beI) : (co,,,t , . , .t) 
where ( label ) is one of PRE ,  POST,  JUDGE,  
TOLD,  and TELL ,  and ( content ) is represented 
by a term ef tile first-order predicate' logic. An 
object and an expertise field are represented by 
an atomic symbol, and an attr ibute of an object 
is represented by a fimction syml)ol. For exam- 
ple, store001(object) ,  records_col lector(expert ise 
field), l ocat ion(s tore001) (a t t r ibutc ) ,  and so forth. 
The user's knowledge about an attr ibute is repre- 
sented by five sentences, all having the same (content) 
representing t.he attr ibute, and one of the five labels. 
The sentenees labeled PRE,  express that  the user 
knows the attrilLutc t)rior to the <lialogue session, while 
those labeled POST,  express that the user has come 
to know it during the session. For instan<:e, PRE:  lo- 
ca t ion(s tore001)  means that the user have ah'eady 
knows the h)catiou of s tore001 betorc the interaction 
starts, whih.' POST:  locat ion(s tore001)  means the 
user has <:ome to know the location through the sys- 
tem's explanation. The sentences labeled JUDGE, 
express the user's (:urrent knowledge and is used 
to exploit tile user mo<lel by other coml><ments in
the dialogue system. For instance, JUDGE:  loca- 
t ion(s tore001)  means the use.r now knows tit(.' loca- 
tion of s tore001.  The sentences labele<l TOLD an(l 
TELL ,  express the evi<le.nce, gained by the user's ut- 
terance and the system's explanation. F<Lr instance, 
TOLD:  name(s tore001)  means the user has iLL- 
dicated by the clues that she knows the name of 
s tore001,  while TELL :  name(s tore001)  means the 
system has explai,m<t the name. For exception, in the 
case of location, the form TELL :  locat ion(X) (whcre  
X is some obje(:t \[l)) is not usc<l because a location 
is explained in terms of the relative h)cation of an- 
other object. Instead, the form TELL :  re la t ion(X ,  
Y)(where X and Y are some ol)ject IDs) is used. 
Tit(.' sentences representing objects and exi)ertisc 
fields have only the label PRE .  The sentence repre- 
senting an object (e.g. PRE:  store001)  means that 
the user knows the object, that  is she knows ,nost of 
the attr ibutes of the object. The sentence represent- 
ing an expertise rich\[ (e.g. PRE:  records_co l lector )  
means thai: the user is an exl)ert of the field, that is 
she knows the objects related to the expertise field. 
3.2 Constructing the Networks 
As mentioned, arcs of the Bayesian network represent 
direct probablistic influence between linked variables. 
Tim directionality of the arcs is essential for rei)resent- 
ing nontransitive dependencies. In order to represent 
the knowledge in terms of Bayesian Network, we must 
interpret he qualitative relation betwee.n the sentences 
that  are represented by our language as a directed arc 
or some such combination of arcs. 
In our ease, the network has two sub-networks. One 
represents the user's knowledge be.fore the dialog ses- 
sion, which is used to guess the user's model fronl her 
utterances . The sentences assigne<l to the nodes in 
this part have either the label PRE  or TOLD.  We 
call this subnetwork the prior part. The other sulmet- 
work in which the nodes have either the label POST 
oi' TELL  is used to deal wil;h tit(', influence of the sys- 
tem's utterances. This sulmetwork we call the poste- 
rior part. It is important ;o make a clear distinction. 
Considering that the system explains a concept, it is 
not proper to assume that the user knows some other 
related concepts. For example, if tile user utters that 
she knows some location x then it can be inferred that 
she also knows locations that  are (:los(; to x. But that 
is not true if the location x is explained by the system. 
The relations ill the prior part of the network are 
categorized into four types as follows: 
(1) tl,e relations between objects in an expertise field 
(2) the relations between attr ibutes of obje(:ts 
(3) the relations lmtween an ol)je<-t and its attr ibutes 
(4) the relations betwee.n an att,' ibute of an object 
and the evi<lence that the user knows it 
The relations (1) are (:oncerL,ed with the expertise 
fiehl. The objects ill the same expertise field are re- 
lated through the expertise field node. We introduce 
the arcs that go from the expertise tMd no<le to the ob- 
je<:t nodes belonging to that fiel(1. For example, ares go 
Dora the node of "records collector" to that of "Com- 
pact Disk","Tower Records" (name of a record store) 
and so on. The level of expertise can be controlled 
by the conditi<mal probal)ilities assigned to the object 
nodes conditioned by tile ext)ertise tMd node. In this 
framework, we can intro<hLce arbitrary numbers of ex- 
pertise fiekls, all of which can be assigned the level of 
expertise. 
'\]/he re.lations (2) are conce.rned with the <lolnain 
knowledge. In our domain, those are the relations be- 
tween the locations, whi<:h are based on the assump- 
tion that  the user l)robably knows the locations close 
to the location she known. TILe relations are assunn.'d 
to be symmetric. A single directe<l arc of Bayesian 
networks does not represent a symmetric relation. In 
ordeL' to rel)resent a symmetric relation, we introduce a
dummy evi(tence node, whereby two arcs go forth from 
the two location nodes as shown in figure 1. The prior

The relations (3) are (:on(:erned with g(:ner~d knowl-
