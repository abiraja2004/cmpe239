Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel syntac-
tic based MT evaluation metric which only
employs the dependency information in
the source side. Experimental results show
that our method achieves higher correla-
tion with human judgments than BLEU,
TER, HWCM and METEOR at both sen-
tence and system level for all of the four
language pairs in WMT 2010.
1 Introduction
Automatic evaluation plays a more important role
in the evolution of machine translation. At the ear-
liest stage, the automatic evaluation metrics only
use the lexical information, in which, BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al, 2002) is the most popular one. BLEU
is simple and effective. Most of the researchers
regard BLEU as their primary evaluation metric
to develop and compare MT systems. However,
BLEU only employs the lexical information and
cannot adequately reflect the structural level sim-
ilarity. Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et
al., 2006) measures the number of edits required to
change the hypothesis into one of the references.
METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), which de-
fines loose unigram matching between the hypoth-
esis and the references with the help of stem-
ming and Wordnet-looking-up, is also a lexical
based method and achieves the first-class human-
evaluation-correlation score. AMBER (Chen and
Kuhn, 2011; Chen et al, 2012) incorporates recall,
extra penalties and some text processing variants
on the basis of BLEU. The main weakness of all
the above lexical based methods is that they cannot
adequately reflect the structural level similarity.
To overcome the weakness of the lexical based
methods, many syntactic based metrics were pro-
posed. Liu and Gildea (2005) proposed STM, a
constituent tree based approach, and HWCM, a
dependency tree based approach.
Both of the two methods compute the similar-
ity between the sub-trees of the hypothesis and the
reference. Owczarzak et al(2007a; 2007b; 2007c)
presented a method using the Lexical-Functional
Grammar (LFG) dependency tree. MAXSIM
(Chan and Ng, 2008) and the method proposed
by Zhu et al(2010) also employed the syntac-
tic information in association with lexical infor-
mation.With the syntactic information which can
reflect structural information, the correlation with
the human judgments can be improved to a certain
extent.
As we know that the hypothesis is potentially
noisy, and these errors expand through the parsing
process. Thus the power of syntactic information
could be considerably weakened.
In this paper, we attempt to overcome the short-
coming of the syntactic based methods and pro-
pose a novel dependency based MT evaluation
metric. The proposed metric only employs the ref-
erence dependency tree which contains both the
lexical and syntactic information, leaving the hy-
pothesis side unparsed to avoid the error propaga-
tion. In our metric, F-score is calculated using the
string of hypothesis and the dependency based n-
grams which are extracted from the reference de-
pendency tree.
Experimental results show that our method
achieves higher correlation with human judgments
than BLEU, HWCM, TER and METEOR at both
sentence level and system level for all of the four
language pairs in WMT 2010.
2 Background: HWCM
HWCM is a dependency based metric which ex-
tracts the headword chains, a sequence of words
which corresponds to a path in the dependency
tree, from both the hypothesis and the reference
dependency tree. The score of HWCM is obtained

HWCM = 1D

In formula (1), D is the maximum length of the
headword chain. chainn(hyp) denotes the set of
the headword chains with length of n in the tree of
hypothesis. count(g) denotes the number of times
g appears in the headword chain of the hypothe-
sis dependency tree and countclip(g) denotes the
clipped number of times when g appears in the the
headword chain of the reference dependency trees.
Clipped means that the count computed from the
headword chain of the hypothesis tree should not
exceed the maximum number of times when g oc-
curs in headword chain of any single reference
tree. The following are two sentences represent-
ing as reference and hypothesis, and Figure 1 and
Figure 2 are the dependency trees respectively.
reference: It is not for want of trying .
hypothesis: This is not for lack of trying .
In the example above, there are 8 1-word, 7 2-
word and 3 3-word headword chains in the hy-
pothesis dependency tree. The number of 1-word
and 2-word headword chains in the hypothesis tree
which can match their counterparts in the refer-
ence tree is 5 and 4 respectively. The 3-word head-
word chains in the hypothesis dependency tree are
is for lack, for lack of and lack of trying. Due to
the difference in the dependency structures, they
have no matches in the reference side.
3 A Novel Dependency Based MT
Evaluation Method
In this new method, we calculate F-score using the
string of hypothesis and the dep-n-grams which
are extracted from the reference dependency tree.
The new method is named DEPREF since it is
a DEPendency based method only using depen-
dency tree of REference to calculate the F-score.
In DEPREF, after the parsing of the reference sen-
tences, there are three steps below being carried
out. 1) Extracting the dependency based n-gram
(dep-n-gram) in the dependency tree of the refer-
ence. 2) Matching the dep-n-gram with the string
of hypothesis. 3) Obtaining the final score of a hy-
pothesis. The detail description of our method will
be found in paper (Liu et al, 2013) . We only give
the experiment results in this paper.
4 Experiments
Both the sentence level evaluation and the system
level evaluation are conducted to assess the per-
formance of our automatic metric. At the sentence
level evaluation, Kendall?s rank correlation coeffi-
cient ? is used. At the system level evaluation, the
Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient ? is used.
4.1 Data
There are four language pairs in our experiments
including German-to-English, Czech-to-English,
French-to-English and Spanish-to-English, which
are all derived from WMT2010. Each of the
four language pairs consists of 2034 sentences and
the references of the four language pairs are the
same. There are 24 translation systems for French-
to-English, 25 for German-to-English, 12 for
Czech-to-English and 15 for Spanish-to-English.
We parsed the reference into constituent tree by
Berkeley parser and then converted the constituent
tree into dependency tree by Penn2Malt 1. Pre-
sumably, we believe that the performance will be
even better if the dependency trees are manually
revised.
In the experiments, we compare the perfor-
mance of our metric with the widely used lexical
based metrics BLEU, TER, METEOR and a de-
pendency based metric HWCM. In order to make
a fair comparison with METEOR which is known
to perform best when external resources like stem
and synonym are provided, we also provide results
of DEPREF with external resources.

column. N stands for the max length of the headword chains in HWCM in Table 1.A.
4.2 Sentence-level Evaluation
Kendall?s rank correlation coefficient ? is em-
ployed to evaluate the correlation of all the MT
evaluation metrics and human judgements at the
sentence level. A higher value of ? means a bet-
ter ranking similarity with the human judges. The
correlation scores of the four language pairs and
the average scores are shown in Table 1.A (without
external resources) and Table 1.B (with stemming
and synonym), Our method performs best when
maximum length of dep-n-gram is set to 3, so we
present only the results when the maximum length
of dep-n-gram equals 3.
From Table 1.A, we can see that all our methods
are far more better than BLEU, TER and HWCM
when there is no external resources applied on all
of the four language pairs. In Table 1.B, external
resources is considered. DEPREF is also better
than METEOR on the four language pairs. From
the comparison between Table 1.A and Table 1.B,
we can conclude that external resources is help-
ful for DEPREF on most of the language pairs.
When comparing DEPREF without external re-
sources with METEOR, we find that DEPREF ob-
tains better results on Czech-English and German-
English.
4.3 System-level Evaluation
We also evaluated the metrics with the human
rankings at the system level to further investigate
the effectiveness of our metrics. The matching of
the words in DEPREF is correlated with the posi-
tion of the words, so the traditional way of com-
puting system level score, like what BLEU does,
is not feasible for DEPREF. Therefore, we resort
to the way of adding the sentence level scores to-
gether to obtain the system level score. At system
level evaluation, we employ Spearman?s rank cor-
relation coefficient ?. The correlations of the four
language pairs and the average scores are shown
in Table 2.A (without external resources) and Ta-
ble 2.B (with stem and synonym).
From Table 2.A, we can see that the correla-
tion of DEPREF is better than BLEU, TER and
HWCM on German-English, Spanish-English and
French-English. On Czech-English, our metric
DEPREF is better than BLEU and TER. In Table
2.B (with stem and synonym), DEPREF obtains
better results than METEOR on all of the language
pairs except one case that DEPREF gets the same
result as METEOR on Czech-English. When com-
paring DEPREF without external resources with
METEOR, we can find that DEPREF gets bet-
ter result than METEOR on Spanish-English and
French-English.
From Table 1 and Table 2, we can conclude
that, DEPREF without external resources can ob-
tain comparable result with METEOR, and DE-
PREF with external resources can obtain better re-
sults than METEOR. The only exception is that at
the system level evaluation, Czech-English?s best
score is abtained by HWCM. Notice that there are
only 12 systems in Czech-English, which means
there are only 12 numbers to be sorted, we believe

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a new automatic MT
evaluation method DEPREF. The experiments are
carried out at both sentence-level and system-level
using four language pairs from WMT 2010. The
experiment results indicate that DEPREF achieves
better correlation than BLEU, HWCM, TER and
METEOR at both sentence level and system level.
