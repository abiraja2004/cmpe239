Abstract
Our efforts in the 2013 NLI shared task fo-
cused on the potential benefits of external cor-
pora. We show that including training data
from multiple corpora is highly effective at ro-
bust, cross-corpus NLI (i.e. open-training task
1), particularly when some form of domain
adaptation is also applied. This method can
also be used to boost performance even when
training data from the same corpus is available
(i.e. open-training task 2). However, in the
closed-training task, despite testing a number
of new features, we did not see much improve-
ment on a simple model based on earlier work.
1 Introduction
Our participation in the 2013 NLI shared task
(Tetreault et al, 2013) follows on our recent work
exploring cross-corpus evaluation, i.e. using dis-
tinct corpora for training and testing (Brooke and
Hirst, 2011; Brooke and Hirst, 2012a; Brooke and
Hirst, 2012b), an approach that is now becoming
fairly standard alternative in relevant work (Bykh
and Meurers, 2012; Tetreault et al, 2012; Swan-
son and Charniak, 2013). Our promotion of cross-
corpus evaluation in NLI was partially motivated by
serious issues with the most popular corpus for na-
tive language identification work up to now, the In-
ternational Corpus of Learner English (Granger et
al., 2009). The new TOEFL-11 (Blanchard et al,
2013) used for this NLI shared task addresses some
of the problems with the ICLE (most glaringly, the
fact that some topics in the ICLE appeared only in
some L1 backgrounds), but, from the perspective of
topic, proficiency, and particularly genre, it is nec-
essarily limited in scope (perhaps even more so than
the ICLE); in short, it addresses only a small por-
tion of the space of learner texts. Our interest, then,
continues to be in robust models for NLI that are not
restricted to utility in a particular corpus, and in our
participation in this task we have focused our efforts
on the open-training tasks which allow the use of
corpora beyond the TOEFL-11. Since participation
in these tasks was low relative to the closed-training
task, fewer papers will address them, making our
emphasis here all the more relevant.
The models built for all of three of the tasks are
extensions of the model used in our recent work
(Brooke and Hirst, 2012b); we will discuss the as-
pects of this model common to all tasks in Section
2. Section 3 is a brief review of our methodology
and results in the closed-training task, which was fo-
cused exclusively on testing features (both new and
old); we found almost nothing that improved on our
best feature set from previous work, and most fea-
tures actually hurt performance. In Section 4, we
discuss the corpora we used for the open-training
tasks, some of which we collected and/or have not
been applied to NLI before. Our approach to the
open-training task 2 using these corpora is presented
in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss how we used
domain adaption methods and our various external
corpora to create the (winning) model for the open-
training task 1, which did not permit usage of the
TOEFL-11; we also present some post hoc testing
(now that TOEFL-11 is no longer off limits). In Sec-
tion 7 we offer conclusions.

2 Basic Model
In our recent work on cross-corpus NLI (Brooke and
Hirst, 2012b), we tested a number of classifier and
feature options, and most of our choices there are
carried over to this work. In particular, we use the
Liblinear SVM 1va (one versus all) classifier (Fan et
al., 2008). Using the TOEFL-11 corpus, we briefly
tested the other options explored in that paper (in-
cluding SVM 1v1) as well as the logistic regression
classifier included in Liblinear, and found that the
SVM 1va classifier was still preferred (with our best
feature set, see below), though the differences in-
volved were marginal. Although small variations in
the choice of C parameter within the SVM model
did occasionally produce benefits (here and in our
previous work), these were not consistent, whereas
the default value of 1 showed consistently near opti-
mal results. We used a binary feature representation,
and then feature vectors were normalized to the unit
circle. With respect to feature selection, our earlier
work used a frequency cutoff of 5 for all features; we
continue to use frequency cutoffs here; other com-
mon feature selection methods (e.g. use of informa-
tion gain) were ineffective in our previous work, so
we did not explore them in detail here.
With regards to the features themselves, our ear-
lier work tested a fairly standard collection of distri-
butional features, including function words, word n-
grams (up to bigram), POS n-grams (up to trigram),
character n-grams (up to trigram), dependencies,
context-free productions, and ?mixed? POS/function
n-grams (up to trigram), i.e. n-grams with all lex-
ical words replaced with part of speech. Most of
these had appeared in previous NLI work (Koppel
et al, 2005; Wong and Dras, 2011; Wong et al,
2012), though until recently word n-grams had been
avoided because of ICLE topic bias. Our best model
used only two of these features, word n-grams and
the mixed POS/function n-grams. This was our
starting point for the present work. The Stanford
parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) was used for POS
tagging and parsing.
Obviously, the training set used varies through-
out the paper, and other differences in specific mod-
els built for each task will be mentioned as they
become relevant. For evaluation here, we primar-
ily use the test set for NLI shared task, though we

ously investigated features; best result is in bold.

employ some other evaluation corpora, as appropri-
ate. During the preparation for the shared task, we
made our decisions regarding models for two tasks
with TOEFL-11 training according to the results in
two training/test sets (800 per language for training,
100 per language for testing) sampled from the re-
leased training data. Since our research was focused
on cross-corpus evaluation, we never created mecha-
nisms for cross-validation in our system, and in fact
it creates practical difficulties for the open-training
task 2, so we do not include cross-validated results
here.
3 Closed-training Task
Our approach to the closed-training task primarily
involved feature testing. Table 1 contains the re-
sults of testing our previously investigated features
from Brooke and Hirst (2012b) in the TOEFL-11,
pivoted around the best set (word n-grams + mixed
POS/Function n-grams) from that earlier work.
Some of the features we rejected in our previous
work also underperform here, in particular charac-
ter and POS n-grams. In fact, character n-grams had
a much more negative effect on performance here
than they had previously. Dependencies are clearly a
useful feature in the TOEFL-11, this is fully consis-
tent with out initial testing. CFG productions offer a
small benefit on top of our base feature set, but are
not useful when dependencies are also included, so
we discarded them. Thus, our feature set going for-
ward consists of word n-grams, mixed POS/function
n-grams, and dependencies.
Next, we evaluate our feature frequency cutoff us-
ing this feature set (Table 2). We used the rather high
cutoff of 5 (for all features) in the previous work be-
cause of our much larger training set. We looked at
189

training task; best result is in bold.
Cutoff Accuracy (%)
At least 5 occurrences 78.9
At least 3 occurrences 79.5
At least 2 occurrences 79.7

higher values there, but for this task we focused on
testing lower values.
Lowering our frequency cutoff is indeed benefi-
cial, and we got our best result in the test set when
we had no feature selection at all. This was not con-
sistent with our preparatory testing, which showed
some benefit to removing hapax legomena, though
the difference was marginal. However, we did in-
clude a run with this option in our final submis-
sion, and so this last result represents our best per-
formance on the closed-training task.
We tested several other feature options that were
added to our system for this task. Inspired by Bykh
and Meurers (2012), we first considered n-grams
(up to trigrams) where at least one lexical word is
abstracted to its POS, and at least one isn?t (par-
tial abstraction). Since dependencies were found to
be a positive feature, we tried adding dependency
chains, which combine two dependencies, i.e. three
lexical words linked by two grammatical relations.
We tested productions with wild cards, e.g. S? NP
VP * matches any sentence production which starts
with NP VP. Tree Substitution grammar fragments
have been shown to be superior to CFG produc-
tions (Swanson and Charniak, 2012); we used raw
Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) fragments for the
TOEFL-111 and tested a subset of those fragments
which involved at least two levels of the grammar
(i.e. those not already covered by n-grams or CFG
productions).
Our final feature option requires slightly more
explanation. Crossley and McNamara (2012) re-
port that metrics associated with word concreteness,
imagability, meaningfulness, and familiarity are use-
ful for NLI; the metrics they use are derived from the
MRC Psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1980),
1We thank Ben Swanson for letting us use his TSG frag-
ments.

tures; best result is in bold.

which assign values for each dimension to individ-
ual words. We used the scores in the MRC to get
an average score for each dimension for each text,
further normalized to the range 0?1; texts with no
words in the dictionaries were assigned the average
across the training set.
Table 3 indicates that all of these new features
were, to varying degrees, a drag on our model. The
strongly negative effect of the MRC lexicons is par-
ticularly surprising. We speculate that this might
might be due partially to problems with combining
a large number of binary features with a small num-
ber of continuous metrics directly in a single SVM.
A meta-classifier might solve this problem, but we
did not explore meta-classification for features here.
Finally, since that information was available to
us, we tested creating sub-models segregated by
topic and proficiency. The topic-segregated model
consisted of 8 SVMs, one for each topic; accu-
racy of this model was quite low, only 67.3%. The
proficiency-segregated model used two groups, high
and low/medium (there were few low texts, so we
did not think they would be sufficient by themselves
for a viable model). Results were higher, 74.9%, but
still well below the best unsegregated model.
4 External Corpora
In this section we review corpora which will be used
for the open-training tasks in the next two sections.
Including the TOEFL-11, there are at least six pub-
licly available multi-L1 learner text corpora for NLI,
with many of these corpora becoming available rel-
atively recently. Below, we introduce each corpus in
detail; a summary of the number of tokens from each
L1 background for each of the corpora is in Table 4.

Lang-8 Lang-8 is a website where language learn-
ers write journal entries in their L2 to be corrected
by native speakers. We collected a large set of these
entries, which we?ve shown to be useful for NLI
(Brooke and Hirst, 2012b), despite the noisiness of
the corpus (for instance, some entries directly mix
L1 and L2). For this task we added more entries
written since the first version was collected (58k
on top of the existing 154k entries).2 The corpus
contains entries from all the L1 backgrounds in the
TOEFL-11, though the amounts for Hindi and par-
ticularly Telugu are small. Since many of the entries
are very short, as in our previous work we add en-
tries of the same L1 together to reach a minimum
size of 250 tokens.
ICLE Before 2011, nearly all work on NLI was
done in the International Corpus of Learner English
or ICLE (Granger et al, 2009), a collection of col-
lege student essays from 15 L1 backgrounds, 8 of
which overlap with the 11 L1s in the TOEFL-11.
Despite known issues that might cause problems
(Brooke and Hirst, 2011), it is probably the closest
match in terms of genre and writer proficiency to the
TOEFL-11.
FCE What we call the FCE corpus is a small
sample of the First Certificate in English portion
of the Cambridge Learner Corpus, which was re-

however, we can offer a list of URLs together with software

leased for the purposes of essay scoring evaluation
(Yannakoudakis et al, 2011); 16 different L1 back-
grounds are represented, 9 of which overlap with the
TOEFL-11. Each of the texts consists of two short
answers in the form of a letter, a report, an article,
or a short story. Relative to the other corpora, the
actual amount of text in the FCE is small.
ICCI Like the ICLE and TOEFL-11, the Inter-
national Corpus of Crosslinguistic Interlanguage
(Tono et al, 2012) is also an essay corpus, though
in contrast with other corpora it is focused on young
learners, i.e. those in grade school. It includes both
descriptive and argumentative essays on a number of
topics. Only 4 of its L1s overlap with the TOEFL-
11.
ICANLE The International Corpus Network of
Asian Learners of English or ICANLE (Ishikawa,
2011) is a collection of essays from college students
in 10 Asian countries; 3 of the L1s overlap with the
TOEFL-11.3 Even more so than the TOEFL-11, this
corpus is strictly controlled for topic, it has only 2
topics (part-time jobs and smoking in restaurants).
One obvious problem with using the above cor-
pora to classify L1s in the TOEFL-11 is the lack
of Hindi and Telugu text, which we found were
the two most easily confused L1s in the closed-
3The ICANLE also contains 103K of Urdu text. Since Urdu
and Hindi are mutually intelligible, this could be a good substi-
tute for Hindi; we overlooked this possibility during our prepa-
ration for the task, unfortunately.

training task. We explored a few methods to get
data to fill this gap. First, we downloaded two
collections of English language Indian news arti-
cles, one from a Hindi newspaper, the Hindus-
tan Times, and one from a Telugu newspaper, the
Andhra Jyothy.4 Second, we extracted a collection
of English tweets from the WORLD twitter corpus
(Han et al, 2012) that were geolocated in the Hindi
and Telugu speaking areas; as with the Lang-8, these
were combined to create texts of at least 250 tokens.5
Our third Indian corpus consists of translations (by
Google Translate) of Hindi and Telugu blogs from
the ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r Dataset (Burton et al,
2009), which we used in other work on using L1
text for NLI (Brooke and Hirst, 2012a). The number
of tokens in each of these corpora are given in Table
5.
5 Open-training Task 2
Our approach to open-training task 2 is based on the
assumption that in many ways it is a direct extension
of the closed-training task. For example, we directly
use the best feature set from that task, with no further
testing. Based on the results in our initial testing,
we used a feature frequency cutoff of 2 during our
testing for open-training task 2; for consistency, we
continue with that cutoff in this section.
We first attempted to integrate information from
other corpora by using a meta-classifier, as was suc-
cessfully used for features by Tetreault et al (2012).
Briefly, classifiers were trained on each major exter-
nal corpus (including only the L1s in the TOEFL-
11), and then tested on the TOEFL-11 training set;
4As with the Lang-8, we cannot distribute the corpus di-
rectly but would be happy to provide URLs and scraping soft-
ware for those would like to build it themselves.
5We extracted India regions 07 and 36 for Hindi, and 02 and
25 for Telegu; We can provide a list of tweet ids for reconstruct-
ing the corpus if desired. Our thanks to Bo Han and Paul Cook
for helping us get these tweets.
TOEFL-11 training was accomplished using 10-fold
crossvalidation (by modifying the code for Liblin-
ear crossvalidation to output margins). With the
TOEFL-11 as the training set, the SVM margins
from each 1va classifier (across all L1s and all cor-
pora) were used as the feature input to the meta-
classifier (also an SVM). In addition to Liblinear,
we also outputted this meta-classification problem to
WEKA format (Witten and Frank, 2005), and tested
a number of other classifier options not available
in Liblinear (e.g. Na??ve Bayes, decision trees, ran-
dom forests). In addition to (continuous) margins,
we also tested using the classification directly. Ul-
timately, we came to the conclusion were that any
use of a meta-classifer came with a cost (a mini-
mum 2?3% drop in performance) that could not be
fully overcome with the additional information from
our external corpora. The result using SVM classi-
fiers, margin features, and an SVM meta-classifier
was 78.5%, well below the TOEFL-11?only base-
line.
The other approach to using these external cor-
pora is to add the data directly to the TOEFL-11 data
and train a single classifier. This is very straightfor-
ward; really the only variable is which corpora will
be included. However, we need to introduce, at this
point, a domain-adaptation technique from our most
recent work (Brooke and Hirst, 2012b), bias adap-
tion, which we used to greatly improve the accu-
racy of cross-corpus classification. Without getting
into the algorithmic details, bias adaption involves
changing the bias (constant) factor of a model until
the output of the model in some dataset is balanced
across classes (or otherwise fits the expected distri-
bution); it partially addresses skewed results due to
differences between training and testing corpora. In
the previous work, we used a separate development
set, but here we rely on the test set itself; since the
technique is unsupervised, we do not need to know
the classes. Table 6 shows model performance after
adding various corpora to the training set (TOEFL-
11 is always included), with and without bias adap-
tion (BA).
Many of the differences in Table 6 are modest,
but there are are few points to be made. First,
there is a small improvement using either the Lang-
8 or the ICLE as additional data. The ICCI, on the
other hand, has a clearly negative effect, perhaps be-

cause of the age or proficiency of the contributors to
that corpus. Bias adaption seems to help when the
(messy and highly unbalanced) Lang-8 is involved
(consistent with our previous work), but it does not
seem useful applied to other corpora, at least not in
this setting.
Our second adaptation technique involves training
data selection, which has been used, for instance in
cross-domain parsing (Plank and van Noord, 2011).
The method used here is very simple: we count the
number of times each word appears in a document in
our test data, rank the texts in our training data ac-
cording to the sum of counts (in the test data) each
word that appears in a training texts, and throw away
a certain numbers of low-ranked texts. For example,
if a training text consists solely of the two words I
agree6 and I appears in 1053 texts in the test set,
and agree appears in 325, then the value for that text
is 1378. This method simultaneously penalizes short
texts, those texts with low lexical diversity, and texts
that do not use the same words as our test set. We
use a fixed cutoff, r, which refers to the proportion
of training data that is thrown away for each L1 (al-
lowing this to work independent of L1 was not ef-
fective). We tested this on this method in tandem
with bias adaption on two corpus sets: The TOEFL-
11 and the Lang-8, and all corpora except the ICCI.
The results are in Table 7. The number in italics is
the best run that we submitted.
Again, it is difficult to come to any firm con-
clusions when the differences are this small, but
6This is not a made-up example; there is actually a text in
the TOEFL-11 corpus like this.

our best results involve all of the corpora (except
the ICCI) and both adaptation techniques. Unfor-
tunately, our initial testing suggested r = 0.2 was
the better choice, so our official best result in this
task (81.6%) is not the best result in this table. Per-
formance clearly drops for r > 0.2. Nevertheless,
nearly all the results in the table show clear improve-
ment on our closed-training task model.
6 Open-training Task 1
The central challenge of open-training task 1 was
that the TOEFL-11 was completely off-limits, even
for testing. Therefore, a discussion of how we pre-
pared for this task is very distinct from a post hoc
analysis of the best method once we allowed our-
selves access to the TOEFL-11; we separate the two
here. We did use the feature set (and frequency cut-
off) from the closed-training (and open-training 2)
task; it was close enough to the feature set from our
earlier work (using the Lang-8, ICLE, and FCE) that
it did not seem like cheating to preserve it.
6.1 Method
Given our failure to create a meta-classifier in open-
training task 2, we did not pursue that option here,
focusing purely on adding corpora directly to a
mixed training set. The central question was which
corpora to add, and whether to use our domain-
adaptation methods. Our experience with the ICCI
in the open-training task 2 suggested that it might be
worth leaving it (or perhaps other corpora) out, but

could we come to that conclusion independently?
Our approach involved considering each external
corpus as a test set, and seeing which other corpora
were useful when included in the training set; cor-
pora which were consistently useful would be in-
cluded in the final set. Our original exploration in-
volved looking at all of the corpora (as test sets),
but it was haphazard; here, we present results just
with the ICLE and the ICANLE, which are arguably
the two closest corpora to the TOEFL-11 in terms
of proficiency and genre. For this, we used a dif-
ferent selection of L1s, 12 for the ICLE, 7 for the
ICANLE; all of these languages appeared in at least
the Lang-8, and 2 of them (Chinese and Japanese)
appeared in all corpora. Both sets were balanced by
L1. Again, we report results with and without bias
adaption. The results for the ICLE are in Table 8.
The clearest result in Table 8 is the consistently
positive effect of bias adaption, at least 10 percent-
age points, which is line with our previous work.
Adding both ICLE and ICNALE to the Lang-8 cor-
pus gave a small boost in performance, but the effect
of the ICCI was once again negative, as was the ef-
fect of our training set selection.
The ICNALE results in Table 9 support many of
the conclusions that we reached in the ICLE (and
other sets like the FCE and ICCI, which are not in-
cluded here but gave similar results); the effect of
bias adaption is even more pronounced. Two dif-
ferences: the slightly positive effect of training data
selection and the positive effect of the ICCI, the lat-
ter of which we saw nowhere else. We speculate
that this might be due to that fact that although the
ICNALE is a college-level corpus, it is a corpus of

Asian-language native speakers. Our theory is that
Europeans are, on average, more proficient users
of English (this is supported by, for instance, the
testing from Granger et al (2009)), and that there-
fore the European component of the low-proficiency
ICCI actually interferes with using high proficiency
as a way of distinguishing European L1s, a problem
which would obviously not extend to an Asian-L1-
only corpus. This is an interesting result, but we will
not explore it further here. In any case, it would lead
us to predict that including ICCI data would be a bad
idea for TOEFL-11 testing.
Since we did not have any way to evaluate our
Indian corpora (i.e. the news, twitter, and translated
blogs from Section 4) without using the TOEFL-11,
we instead took advantage of the option to submit
multiple runs, submitting runs which use each of the
corpora, and combining the blogs and news.
6.2 Post Hoc Analysis
With the TOEFL-11 data now visible to us, we first
ask whether our specially collected Indian corpora
can distinguish texts in the ICCI. The test set used
in Table 10 contains only Hindi and Telugu texts.
The results are quite modest (the guessing baseline
is 50%), but suggest that all three corpora contain
some information that distinguish Hindi and Telugu,
particularly if bias adaption is used.
The results for a selection of models on the full
set of TOEFL-11 languages is presented in Table
11. Since ours was the best-performing model in
this task, we include results for both the TOEFL-
11 training (including development set) and test set,
to facilitate future comparison. Again, there is little
doubt that bias adaption is of huge benefit, though
in fact our results in the Lang-8 alone, without bias

adaption, would have been enough to take first place
in this task. Adding other corpora, including the In-
dian corpora but not the ICCI, did consistently im-
prove performance, as suggested by our testing in
other corpora. Although the translated blog data was
useful in distinguishing Hindi from Telugu alone, it
had an unpredictable effect in the main task, lower-
ing bias-adapted performance. Training set selection
does seem to have a small positive effect, though we
did not see this consistently in our original testing.
7 Conclusion
Our efforts in the 2013 NLI shared task focused on
the potential benefits of external corpora. We have
shown here that including training data from multi-
ple corpora is effective at creating good cross-corpus
NLI systems, particularly when domain adaptation,
i.e. bias adaption or training set selection, is also
applied; we were the highest-performing group in
open-training task 1 by a large margin. This ap-
proach can also be applied to improve performance
even when training data from the same corpus is
available, as in open-training task 2. However, in
the closed-training task, despite testing a number
of new features, we did not see much improvement
on our simple model based on earlier work. Other
teams clearly did find some ways to improve on
this straightforward approach, and we hope to see
to what extent those improvements are generalizable
across different NLI corpora.
