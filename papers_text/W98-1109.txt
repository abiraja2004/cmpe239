Abstract 
In the ACRONYM Project, we have taken the 
Firthian view (e.g. Firth 1957) that context is part 
of the meaning of the word, and measured 
similarity of meaning between words through 
second-order collocation. Using large-scale, free 
text corpora of UK journalism, we have generated 
collocational data for all words except for high- 
frequency grammatical words, and have found 
that semantically related word pairings can be 
identified, whilst syntactic relations are 
disfavoured. We have then moved on to refine 
this system, to deal with multi-word terms and 
identify changing conceptual relationships across 
time. The system, conceived in the late 80's and 
developed in 1994-97, differs from others of the 
90's in purpose, scope, methodology and results, 
and comparisons will be drawn in the course of 
the paper. 
Introduction 
The team at Liverpool has created over the years 
a series of automated systems for handling and 
extracting information from large textual corpora. 
These systems consist of software and knowledge 
bases derived from those same textual resources. 
Most recently, the system known as ACRONYM 
(Automated Collocational Retrieval of 'Nyms') 
has involved the identification of conceptually 
related items. These are referred to as 'nyms', by 
analogy with 'synonyms' and other sense related 
items, as a reflection of the fact that it is 
conceptual similarity that is being discovered 
through collocation. 
Like its predecessors, the ACRONYM 
system has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is 
intended to generate pairs or clusters of items 
which can function as alternative search terms in 
a diachronic text retrieval environment. On the 
other, it is intended to support a description of the 
thesaurus in text. In the latter application, the 
precise nature of the nyms generated by a given 
target word is important. 
The basic system for identifying 
conceptual relations 
The starting point for the nyrnic identification 
system is the raw text from which thesaural 
relations are to be derived. This corpus currently 
contains over 300 million words from The 
Independent ewspaper from 1988 to 1997. As 
with similar work (e.g. Brown et al1992), the size 
of the corpus makes preprocessing such as 
lemmatization, POS tagging or partial parsing, too 
costly. The sole preprocessing performed on the 
corpus is thus the relabelling of numeric tokens 
into general categories. 
During this preprocessing stage, the 
corpus is also integerised and indexed. This 
increases efficiency during later processing 
stages, in particular the creation of the collocate 
? database. Within the system, collocates are by 
default defined as the four words to the left and 
right of every word. The only exceptions to this 
rule are that collocates are not recorded for a set 
of 253 stopwords (high frequency terms; 
grammatical words, numeric labels and some 
verbs), and these are also not recorded as 
collocates of any other word. The raw frequencies 
of left and right span collocates for a given word- 
pair are merged, and their significance measured, 
using a Z-score statistic. Statistically significant 
collocates are then stored as a sparse matrix in the 
collocate database. A corpus of 3 x 108 words and 
1.5 X 10 6 word types produces just over 4.8 x 10 6 
statistically significant collocates (using a liberal 
threshold for significance). 
We refer to the set of statistically 
significant collocates for a given word as a 
'collocational profile'. Similarity between any 
76 
two given words is ~then measured through 
comparison of their pr? files; the measure itself is 
based on the size of tae profiles of both words 
and the number of collocates they share (i.e., 
second order collocarion), and also on the 
collocation between those two words (first order 
colloc~ation). 
The definition of'what constitutes first- 
- order collocation differs f,.~r different researchers. 
For example, the corpus described in 
Grefensttette (1992) is comparatively small, 
allowing for extensive preprocessing, including 
POS tagging and partial parsing. Only modifiers 
and their modified nouns are recorded as 
collocating pairs, allowing for a more fine- 
grained analysis, of just a subset of word classes. 
In contrast, SchiJtze and Pedersen (1995) treat the 
set of collocates for a word as a vector containing 
the frequencies of collocation with other words 
occurring within a 40-word window. Futrelle and 
Gauch (1993) use a similar approach but preserve 
positional information (i.e., the number of words 
to the left and right of the target word). Positional 
information is also retained by Brown et ai 
(1992), who store collocation information as 
word n-grams. 
For very large corpora, a lot of 
collocational information will be generated, 
making any form of collocational similarity 
measurement computationally expensive. Again, 
researchers have adopted iffering approaches to 
this problem. Schtitze and Pedersen (1995) build 
their collocate vectors using a bootstrap method 
involving increasingly larger sets of the lexicon, 
finally constructing a low (20) dimensional word 
vector space by Singular Value Decomposition. A 
simpler method is employed bl? Futrelle and 
Gauch (1993), whereby collocate vectors are 
recorded for all word forms, but for each word 
form, only its frequency of co-occurrence with the 
top 150 most frequent word forms is recorded. 
The researchers use a 2-word window to the left 
and right of the target word, but they also 
preserve the positional information of the 
collocates, resulting in a 600-dimension word- 
vector of mutual information measurements. 
While there are many different ways to 
record collocates, the primary difference between 
the ACRONYM collocate database and those 
detailed above is the omission both of collocation 
involving grammatical function words, and of 
positional information. By omitting these two 
elements, the resulting collocate database focuses 
less on the syntagmatic similarity between words 
and more on their paradigmatic relations. 
Generating conceptually-related 
word pairs 
The definition and purpose of word similarity 
measures in the above systems also differ. Vector- 
based models define similarity as the cosine 
measure between two words, and the purpose of 
Schiitze and Brown's vector-based work is to 
cluster grammatical word classes automatically. 
Mutual information-based approaches, such as 
those of Brown et ai (1992) and Futrelle and 
Gauch (1993), measure word similarity in the 
context of a set of words to be clustered, typically 
with the aim of clustering for general similarity. 
The Jaccard coefficient measurement offered by 
Grefenstette (1992) is the nearest o our own, 
defining similarity simply in terms of the number 
of shared 'attributes' between two words against 
the number of attributes of both. 
While Schiitze and Pedersen (1993), 
Brown et al(1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1993) 
all demonstrate the ability of their systems to 
identify word similarity using clustering on the 
most frequently occurring words in their corpus, 
only Grefenstette (1992) demonstrates his system 
by generating word similarities with respect o a 
set of target words. His purpose is to allow a user 
to specify a target word, and have the system 
return an ordered list of related words. To this 
extent, the purpose of the basic ACRONYM 
system is echoed in Grefenstette's work. 
Given the liberal thresholds currently 
used in the ACRONYM system, such a list of 
conceptually related words may contain several 
tens of thousands of entries. As the size of the 
lexicon renders it computationally infeasible to 
calculate all word-pair similarities in advance, the 
system generates word similarity measures for a 
given word on the fly, using the collocate 
database described above. 
Examples of conceptually-related, or
nymic, output are given in Table ! for the node 
words key. medicine, pretty and testing.

Modification to software to increase 
semantic nature of nymic output 
The nymic output in Table ! contains collocates 
and other related items, which are relevant in 
principle for IT purposes, but which for linguistic 
purposes may be usefully separated out. This is 
achieved by using only second order collocation, 
which boosts semantically (and morphologically) 
related nymic output, as can be seen in Table 2.

The Deese Antonyms 
The focussing effect achieved by suppressing first 
order collocational information may be further 
demonstrated with reference to the work of Deese 
(1964), cited in Grefenstette (1992), and 
specifically to a set of conceptuaily-related 
antonymic pairs which Deese had identified by a 
series of psycholinguistic tests. Grefenstette 
hypothesised that any system identifying shared 
collocation between words would pick up the 
Deese antonyms as being strongly related; he 
experimented by feeding the 'primer' word for 
each of those antonym; into his SEXTANT 
system, and listing the 19 most closely related 
words produced. 
The same 'primer' words were fed into 
the refined ACRONYM System, i.e. with first- 
order collocates uppressed, and the results are 
displayed in Table 3 orn the next page. (Deese 
antonyms, where they o=cur, are capitalised). 
A basic comparison reveals that the 
ACRONYM system yiel.ls a similar level of results - 
to Grefenstette's system. 15133 of the Deese 
antonyms occur in SEXTANT output as first or 
second most-related word, compared with 13 
generated by ACRONYM; whilst 16 of the Deese 
antonyms appear within the top 10 most related 
words of SEXTANT output, compared with 18 in 
output from ACRONYM. Similarly, as with 
Grefenstette's findings, there are cases where 
ACRONYM yields a non-Deese antonym which is 
nevertheless close: see for instance: big-small; 
dark-pale; deep-surface; happy-unhappy; new- 
existing; old-modern. A scrutiny of the actual 
contents of each ACRONYM list further reveals 
that, like Futrelle and Gauch, ACRONYM when 
using the particular non collocate upweighting ? 
method iscovers "... (entire) graded fields, rather 
than just pairs of opposites". Of particular 
interest in this respect are the results for big, easy, 
fast and strong. 
For some words in Table 3, failure to 
relate closely to their Deese antonym can in part 
be explained by textual domain. For example, in 
the listing for empty, the strongest nyms reflect 
the sense of an empty building or structure, 
suggesting that such a context predominates 
throughout the corpus. Likewise, with the word 
pretty, we see that intensifiers predominate as 
nyms, with the synonym lovely appearing only in 
9th place. Analysis of a random sample of the 
corpus reveals that pretty is indeed predominantly 
adverbial, and only rarely adjectival. 
Multi-Word Nyms 
As described, the basic ACRONYM system 
generates information on both first and second 
order collocates within its single-word nymic 
output. First order collocation can be suppressed 
to enrich the semantic information, as

Table 3: Deese antonyms in 
demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2. Often, however, 
these collocates are really part of multi-word 
units, combining with other words to form 
hyponyms. They often combine with the target 
word itself, thereby forming hyponyms of the 
type "ordinate plus modifier'. These items are of 
prime importance in linguistic description, since 
they represent hitherto undocumented differences 
between the textual thesaurus and the mental 
lexicon. 
Another refinement to the basic 
ACRONYM system is therefore achieved when the 
nyms of the single-word nymic output are re- 
combined into multi-word units which better 
represent he target concept. This procedure is 
carried out in two stages. First, the list of nyms is 
ACRONYM nymic output 
processed by a software module which attempts 
to identify the most likely word pairs that could 
be created by combining the individual nyms, 
making use of a variety of measures including 
collocational as well as contextual clues from the 
corpus database. The resulting list of word 
combinations, which need not necessarily be 
adjacent, is passed to a second-stage module, 
which checks which of these candidate word pairs 
have collocational environments similar to the 
original node word. The benefits of this approach 
are that no a priori word-pair list needs to be 
established, this being decided by the contents of 
the nym list and by the corpus, and that no 
collocational profiles need to be stored for word 
pairs.

In Tables 4 and 5, a series of multi-word

adjectives or nouns modifying the node or 
synonyms of it. 
Multi-word nodes are a further refinement 
of the system. As with multi-word nymic output, 
the collocate profiles for multi-word nodes are 
generated on the fly. Table 6 presents an example 
of the multi-word nymic output for the multi-

Semantic Clustering 
As well as generating flat lists of semantically 
related words, the ACRONYM system can perform 
clustering upon a set of nyms, in order to reveal 
their semantic inter-relationships. In ACRONYM, 
the set of words to be clustered is usually one of 
the flat lists of nyms of the kind displayed above. 
This is in contrast o work by researchers such as 
Schiitze and Pedersen (1992), Brown et al(1992) 
and Futrelle and Gauch (1995), where it is often 
the most frequent words in the lexicon which are 
clustered, predominantly with the purpose of 
determining their grammatical classes. 
ACRONYM uses two publicly available 
clustering tools, PAM and AGNES, described in 
Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). The first, PAM 
(Partitioning Around Medoids), is a k-medoid 
partitioning method, while AGNES is a variant on 
agglomerative nesting. Both algorithms allow 
object-relations to be represented by a similarity 
measure, which we take as the collocational 
profile similarity measure described earlier. An 
example of PAM output is shown in Table 7.

Table 7: PAM Clustering for water 
The PAM-generated clusters in Table 7 
are created from the top nyms for water, and 
reflect several different meanings (senses, uses or 
references) that are associated with the node 
80 
word, namely: (1) 'water utility', (2) 'body of 
water', (3) 'type of drinking water', (4) 'fluid 
measurement', (5) 'unit of water', (6) 'liquid used 
in cooking', (7) 'medium for certain domestic 
processes', and (9) 'water in various more or less 
pure states'. Some of these senses are fairly 
conventional, others are more contextually 
determined. Not every cluster is adequate; here, 
Cluster 8 is weak and uninterpretable. Taken 
overall, it seems that this type of clustering does 
sharpen the picture for the user of the system. 
While previous researchers have used 
agglomerative n sting clustering (e.g. Brown et al
(1992), Futrelle and Gauch (1993)), comparisons 
with our work are difficult to draw, due to their 
use of the 1,000 commonest words from their 
respective corpora. 
In Brown et al(1992), the authors provide 
some sample subtrees resulting from such a 
1,000-word clustering. The sets of words from 
each subtree have been fed into the ACRONYM 
clustering system, and the results from AGNES 
are shown below. This is not strictly a fair 
comparison, as the clustering of a superset of 
these words would doubtless create a different 
structure. Nevertheless, it appears that 
ACRONYM organises these subsets into a more 
satisfactory taxonomy, in contrast with a tendency 
in Brown et als system to produce right-heavy 
taxonomies. 
In Fig. I, the last example highlights a 
distinction between syntax and semantics. While 
Brown et als system splits the four words along 
the singular/plural divide (i.e., rep-representative 
and reps-representatives), ACRONYM splits them 
semantically; the abbreviated versions refer to 
sales-people or those representing travel 
companies, whilst the full versions are used in a 
political context, 
Identifying Change in Conceptual 
Relations 
The ACRONYM database has also been designed 
in such a way that it can be accessed 
diachronically. This facility was incorporated in
order to ensure that the system remains up to date 
in its application to text retrieval and linguistic 
description, and it has already enabled the Unit to 
establish a new words service within its web site 
(http://www.rdues.liv.ac.uk/newwds.html). 
The team first explored the way in which 
language changes over time in the AVIATOR 
Project (Renouf 1993, Collier 1993, Blackwell 
1993), where they investigated the dynamic 
aspects not only of single words, but also of the 
collocational behaviour of those words, with the 
goal of identifying new collocations or changes in 
meaning. In ACRONYM (Renouf 1996, Collier & 
Pacey 1996), the collocational and diachronic 
concepts have been developed considerably, 
taking advantage Of improvements in technology 
and the greater availability of electronic text. The 
result is an integrated system of databases and 
indexes which can be accessed as one virtual 
entity or divided into any desired configuration of 
its constituent parts. In the current database, the 
smallest accessible component, which we refer to 
as a se~,ment, consists of three months' of text 
from national UK newspapers, containing on 
average ight million running words (tokens). 
Each segment is composed of an 
integerised corpus database? providing all the 
usual corpus- and text-retrieval facilities from 
simple frequency information for a single word to 
the full KWIC, sentence or article context for 
boolean (multi-word) searches. The frequency 
data is readily extractable? allowing a word or 
phrase to be 'tracked' over time. In addition, each 
segment has one or more collocate databases 
which store profiles for each word in the corpus. 
By comparing the output from two collocate 
databases, the change in coilocational behaviour 
of any node can be identified in a similar fashion 
to a change in frequency-of-occurrence. As 
established in the AVIATOR Project? an alteration 
in a word's profile signals a change in its 
meaning, with a consequent change in the set of 
words which can be regarded as its semantic 
equivalents. If we require time scales longer than 
three months, the software needs to perform a 
comparison across several collocate databases 
rather than just two. In order to accelerate this 
process, we have added a facility for creating 
merged atabases, for example combining all four 
databases for 1994 into one. By using this in 
conjunction with a similarly merged atabase

based on other individual segments, the collocate 
comparison process can be carried out more 
efficiently. 
When identifying nymic change, we 
generally increase the time period to a whole year, 
to avoid recording any seasonal fluctuations in 
real world events. The usual procedure is to create 
two merged collocate databases, one for the year 
in question (the target corpus) and another of all 
segment databases prior to that year (the baseline 
corpus). These two databases are then compared 
and any significant change in collocate profiles is 
recorded. This may be done for individual words 
or all the words in the corpus. In looking at the 
changed profiles, the collocates are categorised 
into four sets: 
'up' collocates 
those which have increased in significance 
in the target corpus; 
'down' collocates 
those which have decreased in 
significance in the target corpus; 
'new' collocates 
those which have appeared for the first 
time in the target corpus; 
'gone' collocates 
those which appeared in the baseline 
corpus but which are no longer present in 
the target corpus. 
The normal process of nym identification, 
as explained earlier, finds candidates which have 
as many collocates as possible in common with 
the target word. In monitoring the change in 
nymic relationships, however, only those 
collocates which are considered to have changed 
are involved in this process. The semantic 
proximity of the target word to the candidate 
nyms is therefore measured in terms of the 
number of changed collocates the two words have 
in common. If the task is to identify new nyms, 
then only 'up' and 'new' collocates are used; 
conversely, 'down' and 'gone' collocates are 
employed in finding nyms which have decreased 
in significance. This is exemplified in Table 8,

next stage involves the identification of words

methodology is to provide up-to-date information 
on thesaural equivalents, it can also be used to 
find nyms which have declined in significance. 
The output is harder to interpret, since the 
difference in size between the baseline and target 
databases results in many more down/gone 
collocates than up/new ones. For crisis, as an 
example, there were 3,187 down/gone collocates 
but only 68 new/up ones. Nevertheless, the nyms 
which are generated by using the down/gone 
collocates can be useful and interesting. Tables 
10a and 10b show nyms for war, using 1993 as 
the target corpus and all previous data (1988- 
1992) as the baseline;

Table 10a: 'up' nyms of war  (1993) 
In Table 10a, the 'up" nyms are presented 
and it can be seen that these all relate to the civil 
war in the former Yugoslavia. In Table 10b, in 
contrast, those nyms are listed which in 1993 
? became less closely associated with war.

Table 10b: 'down' nyms of war  (1993) 
The main reference reflected in the 'down 
nyms' of Table 10b is to the Gulf War, which 
followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The 
implication of this evidence is that by 1993, the 
Gulf War had ceased to figure so prominently in 
83 
our corpus data and so had become less strongly 
associated with the concept of war. 
Concluding Remarks 
This paper has described the basic ACRONYM 
system, a set of tools which has relevance both to 
text retrieval applications and to linguistic 
description. The focus here has been on outlining 
the recent modifications which have been carried 
out to refine the nymic output to facilitate the 
linguistic task of describing the textual thesaurus. 
Several of them, in particular semantic lustering, 
are also intended to improve performance in 
document retrieval. The nymic output from 
ACRONYM intuitively appears to have the 
potential to increase both recall and precision, and 
initial tests of its effectiveness in this regard have 
been carried out, by using nymic output o extract 
article headlines. The next stage of the research 
will focus more closely on the evaluation and 
optimisation of the system as a text retrieval 
facility.
