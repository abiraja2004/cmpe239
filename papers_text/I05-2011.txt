Abstract 
We describe a sentence-level opinion 
detection system. We first define what 
an opinion means in our research and 
introduce an effective method for ob-
taining opinion-bearing and non-
opinion-bearing words. Then we de-
scribe recognizing opinion-bearing sen-
tences using these words We test the 
system on 3 different test sets: MPQA 
data, an internal corpus, and the TREC-
2003 Novelty track data. We show that 
our automatic method for obtaining 
opinion-bearing words can be used ef-
fectively to identify opinion-bearing 
sentences. 
1 Introduction 
Sophisticated language processing in recent 
years has made possible increasingly complex 
challenges for text analysis. One such challenge 
is recognizing, classifying, and understanding 
opinionated text. This ability is desirable for 
various tasks, including filtering advertisements, 
separating the arguments in online debate or 
discussions, and ranking web documents cited as 
authorities on contentious topics.   
The challenge is made very difficult by a 
general inability to define opinion. Our prelimi-
nary reading of a small selection of the available 
literature (Aristotle, 1954; Toulmin et al, 1979; 
Perelman, 1970; Wallace, 1975), as well as our 
own text analysis, indicates that a profitable ap-
proach to opinion requires a system to know 
and/or identify at least the following elements: 
the topic (T), the opinion holder (H), the belief 
(B), and the opinion valence (V). For the pur-
poses of the various interested communities, 
neutral-valence opinions (such as we believe the 
sun will rise tomorrow; Susan believes that John 
has three children) is of less interest; more rele-
vant are opinions in which the valence is posi-
tive or negative. Such valence often falls 
together with the actual belief, as in ?going to 
Mars is a waste of money?; in which the word 
waste signifies both the belief a lot [of money] 
and the valence bad/undesirable, but need not 
always do so: ?Smith[the holder] believes that 
abortion should be permissible[the topic] al-
though he thinks that is a bad thing[the va-
lence]?.   
As the core first step of our research, we 
would like an automated system to identify, 
given an opinionated text, all instances of the 
[Holder/Topic/Valence] opinion triads it con-
tains1. Exploratory manual work has shown this 
to be a difficult task. We therefore simplify the 
task as follows.  We build a classifier that sim-
ply identifies in a text all the sentences express-
ing a valence. Such a two-way classification is 
simple to set up and evaluate, since enough test-
ing data has been created.   
As primary indicators, we note from newspa-
per editorials and online exhortatory text that 
certain modal verbs (should, must) and adjec-
tives and adverbs (better, best, unfair, ugly, nice, 
desirable, nicely, luckily) are strong markers of 
opinion. Section 3 describes our construction of 
a series of increasingly large collections of such 
marker words. Section 4 describes our methods 
for organizing and combining them and using 
them to identify valence-bearing sentences.  The 
evaluation is reported in Section 5.   
2 Past Computational Studies 
There has been a spate of research on identify-
ing sentence-level subjectivity in general and 
opinion in particular. The Novelty track 
                                                          
1 In the remainder of the paper, we will mostly use ?opin-
ion? in place of ?valence?.  We will no longer discuss Be-
lief, Holder, or Topic. 
61
(Soboroff and Harman, 2003) of the TREC-2003 
competition included a task of recognizing opin-
ion-bearing sentences (see Section 5.2).   
Wilson and Wiebe (2003) developed an anno-
tation scheme for so-called subjective sentences 
(opinions and other private states) as part of a 
U.S. government-sponsored project (ARDA 
AQUAINT NRRC) in 2002. They created a cor-
pus, MPQA, containing news articles manually 
annotated. Several other approaches have been 
applied for learning words and phrases that sig-
nal subjectivity. Turney (2002) and Wiebe 
(2000) focused on learning adjectives and adjec-
tival phrases and Wiebe et al (2001) focused on 
nouns. Riloff et al (2003) extracted nouns and 
Riloff and Wiebe (2003) extracted patterns for 
subjective expressions using a bootstrapping 
process.  
3 Data Sources 
We developed several collections of opinion-
bearing and non-opinion-bearing words. One is 
accurate but small; another is large but relatively 
inaccurate. We combined them to obtain a more 
reliable list. We obtained an additional list from 
Columbia University. 
3.1 Collection 1: Using WordNet 
In pursuit of accuracy, we first manually col-
lected a set of opinion-bearing words (34 adjec-
tives and 44 verbs). Early classification trials 
showed that precision was very high (the system 
found only opinion-bearing sentences), but since 
the list was so small, recall was very low (it 
missed many). We therefore used this list as 
seed words for expansion using WordNet. Our 
assumption was that synonyms and antonyms of 
an opinion-bearing word could be opinion-
bearing as well, as for example ?nice, virtuous, 
pleasing, well-behaved, gracious, honorable, 
righteous? as synonyms for ?good?, or ?bad, evil, 
disreputable, unrighteous? as antonyms. How-
ever, not all synonyms and antonyms could be 
used: some such words seemed to exhibit both 
opinion-bearing and non-opinion-bearing senses, 
such as ?solid, hot, full, ample? for ?good?.  
This indicated the need for a scale of valence 
strength. If we can measure the ?opinion-based 
closeness? of a synonym or antonym to a known 
opinion bearer, then we can determine whether 
to include it in the expanded set.  
To develop such a scale, we first created a 
non-opinion-bearing word list manually and 
produced related words for it using WordNet.  
To avoid collecting uncommon words, we 
started with a basic/common English word list 
compiled for foreign students preparing for the 
TOEFL test. From this we randomly selected 
462 adjectives and 502 verbs for human annota-
tion. Human1 and human2 annotated 462 adjec-
tives and human3 and human2 annotated 502 
verbs, labeling each word as either opinion-
bearing or non-opinion-bearing.

Figure 1. Automatic word expansion using WordNet 
Now, to obtain a measure of opinion/non-
opinion strength, we measured the WordNet 
distance of a target (synonym or antonym) word 
to the two sets of manually selected seed words 
plus their current expansion words (see Figure 
1). We assigned the new word to the closer 
category. The following equation represents this 
approach:

where c is a category (opinion-bearing or non-
opinion-bearing), w is the target word, and synn 
is the synonyms or antonyms of the given word 
by WordNet. To compute equation (1), we built 
a classification model, equation (2):

where kf  is the kth feature of category c which is 
also a member of the synonym set of the target 
word w, and count(fk, synset(w)) means the total 
number of occurrences of fk in the synonym set 
of w. The motivation for this model is document 
classification.  (Although we used the synonym 
set of seed words achieved by WordNet, we 
could instead have obtained word features from 
a corpus.) After expansion, we obtained 2682 
62
opinion-bearing and 2548 non-opinion-bearing 
adjectives, and 1329 opinion-bearing and 1760 
non-opinion-bearing verbs, with strength values. 
By using these words as features we built a Na-
ive bayesian classifier and we finally classified 
32373 words. 
3.2 Collection 2: WSJ Data 
Experiments with the above set did not provide 
very satisfactory results on arbitrary text. For 
one reason, WordNet?s synonym connections 
are simply not extensive enough. However, if 
we know the relative frequency of a word in 
opinion-bearing texts compared to non-opinion-
bearing text, we can use the statistical informa-
tion instead of lexical information. For this, we 
collected a huge amount of data in order to make 
up for the limitations of collection 1. 
Following the insight of Yu and Hatzivassi-
loglou (2003), we made the basic and rough as-
sumption that words that appear more often in 
newspaper editorials and letters to the editor 
than in non-editorial news articles could be po-
tential opinion-bearing words (even though edi-
torials contain sentences about factual events as 
well). We used the TREC collection to collect 
data, extracting and classifying all Wall Street 
Journal documents from it either as Editorial or 
nonEditorial based on the occurrence of the 
keywords ?Letters to the Editor?, ?Letter to the 
Editor? or ?Editorial? present in its headline.  
This produced in total 7053 editorial documents 
and 166025 non-editorial documents.   
We separated out opinion from non-opinion 
words by considering their relative frequency in 
the two collections, expressed as a probability, 
using SRILM, SRI?s language modeling toolkit 
(http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). For 
every word W occurring in either of the docu-
ment sets, we computed the followings: 
documents Editorialin   wordstotal
documents Editorialin W #)(Pr =WobEditorial
docs alnonEditoriin   wordstotal
docs alnonEditoriin W #)(Pr =WobalnonEditori
  
We used Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and 
Ney, 1995) to handle unknown/rare words.  
Having obtained the above probabilities we cal-
culated the score of W as the following ratio: 
alProb(W)nonEditori
rob(W)EditorialP )( =WScore
 
Score(W) gives an indication of the bias of 
each word towards editorial or non-editorial 
texts. We computed scores for 86,674,738 word 
tokens. Naturally, words with scores close to 1 
were untrustworthy markers of valence.  To 
eliminate these words we applied a simple filter 
as follows. We divided the Editorial and the 
non-Editorial collections each into 3 subsets. For 
each word in each {Editorial, non-Editorial} 
subset pair we calculated Score(W). We retained 
only those words for which the scores in all 
three subset pairs were all greater than 1 or all 
less than 1.  In other words, we only kept words 
with a repeated bias towards Editorial or non-
Editorial. This procedure helped eliminate some 
of the noisy words, resulting in 15568 words.  
3.3 Collection 3: With Columbia Wordlist 
Simply partitioning WSJ articles into Edito-
rial/non-Editorial is a very crude differentiation.  
In order to compare the effectiveness of our im-
plementation of this idea with the implementa-
tion by Yu and Hatzivassiloglou of Columbia 
University, we requested their word list, which 
they kindly provided. Their list contained 
167020 adjectives, 72352 verbs, 168614 nouns, 
and 9884 adverbs. However, this figure is sig-
nificantly inflated due to redundant counting of 
words with variations in capitalization and a 
punctuation.We merged this list and ours to ob-
tain collection 4. Among these words, we only 
took top 2000 opinion bearing words and top 
2000 non-opinion-bearing words for the final 
word list. 
3.4 Collection 4: Final Merger  
So far, we have classified words as either opin-
ion-bearing or non-opinion-bearing by two dif-
ferent methods.  The first method calculates the 
degrees of closeness to manually chosen sets of 
opinion-bearing and non-opinion-bearing words 
in WordNet and decides its class and strength. 
When the word is equally close to both classes, 
it is hard to decide its subjectivity, and when 
WordNet doesn?t contain a word or its syno-
nyms, such as the word ?antihomosexsual?, we 
fail to classify it.   
The second method, classification of words 
using WSJ texts, is less reliable than the lexical 
method.  However, it does for example success-
fully handle ?antihomosexual?.  Therefore, we 
combined the results of the two methods (collec-
tions 1 and 2), since their different characteris-
63
tics compensate for each other. Later we also 
combine 4000 words from the Columbia word 
list to our final 43700 word list. Since all three 
lists include a strength between 0 and 1, we 
simply averaged them, and normalized the va-
lence strengths to the range from -1 to +1, with 
greater opinion valence closer to 1 (see Table 1).  
Obviously, words that had a high valence 
strength in all three collections had a high over-
all positive strength. When there was a conflict 
vote among three for a word, it aotomatically 
got weak strength. Table 2 shows the distribu-
tion of words according to their sources: Collec-
tion1(C1), Collection2(C2) and Collection3(C3). 
4 Measuring Sentence Valence 
4.1   Two Models 
We are now ready to automatically identify 
opinion-bearing sentences.  We defined several 
models, combining valence scores in different 
ways, and eventually kept two:  
Model 1: Total valence score of all words in a 
sentence  
Model 2: Presence of a single strong valence 
word  
The intuition underlying Model 1 is that sen-
tences in which opinion-bearing words dominate 
tend to be opinion-bearing, while Model 2 re-
flects the idea that even one strong valence word 
is enough.  After experimenting with these mod-
els, we decided to use Model 2.   
How strong is ?strong enough??  To deter-
mine the cutoff threshold (?) on the opinion-
bearing valence strength of words, we experi-
mented on human annotated data.  
4.2   Gold Standard Annotation  
We built two sets of human annotated sentence 
subjectivity data.  Test set A contains 50 sen-
tences about welfare reform, of which 24 sen-
tences are opinion-bearing.  Test set B contains 
124 sentences on two topics (illegal aliens and 
term limits), of which 53 sentences are opinion-
bearing. Three humans classified the sentences 
as either opinion or non-opinion bearing.  We 
calculated agreement for each pair of humans 
and for all three together.  Simple pairwise 
agreement averaged at 0.73, but the kappa score 
was only 0.49.  
Table 3 shows the results of experimenting 
with different combinations of Model 1, Model 
2, and several cutoff values. Recall, precision, F-
score, and accuracy are defined in the normal 
way. Generally, as the cutoff threshold in-
creases, fewer opinion markers are included in 
the lists, and precision increases while recall 
drops. The best F-core is obtained on Test set A, 
Model 2, with ?=0.1 or 0.2 (i.e., being rather 
liberal).

5 Results 
We tested our system on three different data sets.  
First, we ran the system on MPQA data pro-
vided by ARDA. Second, we participated in the 
novelty track of TREC 2003. Third, we ran it on 
our own test data described in Section 4.2. 
5.1  MPQA Test 
The MPQA corpus contains news articles manu-
ally annotated using an annotation scheme for 
subjectivity (opinions and other private states 
that cannot be directly observed or verified. 
(Quirk et al, 1985), such as beliefs, emotions, 
sentiment, speculation, etc.). This corpus was 
collected and annotated as part of the summer 
2002 NRRC Workshop on Multi-Perspective 
Question Answering (MPQA) (Wiebe et al, 
2003) sponsored by ARDA. It contains 535 
documents and 10,657 sentences.   
The annotation scheme contains two main 
components: a type of explicit private state and 
speech event, and a type of expressive subjec-
tive element. Several detailed attributes and 
strengths are annotated as well. More details are 
provided in (Riloff et al, 2003).   
Subjective sentences are defined according to 
their attributes and strength. In order to apply 
our system at the sentence level, we followed 
their definition of subjective sentences. The an-
notation GATE_on is used to mark speech 
events and direct expressions of private states.  
The onlyfactive attribute is used to indicate 
whether the source of the private state or speech 
event is indeed expressing an emotion, opinion 
or other private state. GATE_expressive-
subjectivity annotation marks words and phrases 
that indirectly express a private state. 
In our experiments, our system performed 
relatively well in both precision and recall. We 
interpret our opinion markers as coinciding with 
(enough of) the ?subjective? words of MPQA.  
In order to see the relationship between the 
number of opinion-bearing words in a sentence 
and its classification by MPQA as subjective, 
we varied the threshold number of opinion-
bearing words required for subjectivity. Table 4 
shows accuracy, precision, and recall according 
to the list used and the threshold value t. 
The random row shows the average of ten 
runs of randomly assigning sentences as either 
subjective or objective. As we can see from Ta-
ble 4, our word list which is the combination of 
the Collection1 and Collection2, achieved 
higher accuracy and precision than the Colum-
bia list. However, the Columbia list achieved 
higher recall than ours. For a fair comparison, 
we took top 10682 opinion-bearing words from 
each side and ran the same sentence classifier 
system.2  
5.2 TREC data 
Opinion sentence recognition was a part of the 
novelty track of TREC 2003 (Soboroff and Har-
man, 2003). The task was as follows.  Given a 
TREC topic and an ordered list of 25 documents 
relevant to the topic, find all the opinion-bearing 
sentences. No definition of opinion was pro-
vided by TREC; their assessor?s intuitions were 
considered final. In 2003, there were 22 opinion 
topics containing 21115 sentences in total.  The 
opinion topics generally related to the pros and 
cons of some controversial subject, such as, 
?partial birth abortion ban?, ?Microsoft antitrust 
charges?, ?Cuban child refugee Elian Gonzalez?, 
?marijuana legalization?, ?Clinton relationship 
with Lewinsky?, ?death penalty?, ?adoption 
same-sex partners, and etc. For the opinion top-
ics, a sentence is relevant if it contains an opin-
ion about that subject, as decided by the assessor.  
There was no categorizing of polarity of opinion 
or ranking of sentences by likelihood that they 
contain an opinion. F-score was used to measure 
system performance. 
We submitted 5 separate runs, using different 
models. Our best model among the five was 
Model 2. It performed the second best of the 55 
runs in the task, submitted by 14 participating 
                                                          
2 In comparison, the HP-Subj (height precision subjectivity 
classifier) (Riloff, 2003) produced recall 40.1 and precision 
90.2 on test data using text patterns, and recall 32.9 and 
precision 91.3 without patterns.  These figures are compa-
rable with ours.

institutions. (Interestingly, and perhaps disturb-
ingly, RUN3, which simply returned every sen-
tence as opinion-bearing, fared extremely well, 
coming in 11th.  This model now provides a 
baseline for future research.) After the TREC 
evaluation data was made available, we tested 
Model 1 and Model 2 further. Table 5 shows the 
performance of each model with the two best-
performing cutoff values.

5.3 Test with Our Data 
Section 4.2 described our manual data annota-
tion by 3 humans. Here we used the work of one 
human as development test data for parameter 
tuning.  The other set with 62 sentences on the 
topic of gun control we used as blind test data. 
Although the TREC and MPQA data sets are lar-
ger and provide comparisons with others? work, 
and despite the low kappa agreement values, we 
decided to obtain cutoff values on this data too. 
The graphs in Figure 3 show the performance of 
Models 1 and 2 with different values. 
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we described an efficient auto-
matic algorithm to produce opinion-bearing 
words by combining two methods. The first 
method used only a small set of human-
annotated data. We showed that one can find 
productive synonyms and antonyms of an opin-
ion-bearing word through automatic expansion 
in WordNet and use them as feature sets of a 
classifier. To determine a word?s closeness to 
opinion-bearing or non-opinion-bearing synoym 
set, we also used all synonyms of a given word 
as well as the word itself. An additional method, 
harvesting words from WSJ, can compensate the 
first method.   
Using the resulting list, we experimented with 
different cutoff thresholds in the opinion/non-
opinion sentence classification on 3 different 
test data sets.  Especially on the TREC 2003 
Novelty Track, the system performed well. We 
plan in future work to pursue the automated 
analysis of exhortatory text in order to produce 
detailed argument graphs reflecting their au-
thors? argumentation.
