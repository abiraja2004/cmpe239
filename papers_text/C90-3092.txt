fau l t s  in natura l  l anguage ut te rances  are 
except  for agreement  e r ro rs  and cer ta in  cases  
of overgenera l i za t ion  and in ter fe rence  
s t rong ly  based  on the pr inc ip les  of e r ro r  
ant i c ipat ion  (cf. Yazdan i  1988, Schwind  1988, 
Cat t  1988): Rather  t iny  context  f ree grammars  
are enhanced  by some add i t iona l  ru les  wh ich  
descr ibe  se lec ted  fau l ty  s t ruc tures  and in- 
voke er ror  messages  zf they  are needed for a 
success fu l  parse. The e f fo r ts  requ i red  to 
compi le  an at leas t  approx imat ive ly  compre-  
hens ive  ru le  set even  for s imp le  domains  of  
grammar  are cons iderab le .  Deszdes  this, it is 
the s tudent ' s  r i sk  to fa l l  in to  the remaln inq  
~ap of neg lec ted  poss ib i l i t i es  wh ich  seems to 
be d i f f i cu l t  to avoid. Hopefu l ly ,  an improve-  
meat  of th is  s i tuat ion  can be ach ieved  by an 
app l i ca t ion  of mode l -based  reason ing  proce-  
dures,  where  an in terna l  mode l  (of  language 
cor rec tness )  is used to s imu la te  and eva luate  
e r ror  hypotheses  by invest igat ing  the i r  con-  
sequences  for o ther  par ts  of the mode\].  To a 
cer ta in  degree  the d iagnost i c  resu l t s  are 
log ica l ly  determined  by the cor rec t  remainder  
of the u t te rance  and use fu l  resu l t s  requ i re  a 
ba lanced  ra t io  between cor rec t  and incor rec t  
language use w i th in  the so lu t lon  of the 
s tudent .  
P rov ided  a cor rec t  and cover ing  mode l  can 
be supp l ied  for a l im i ted  domain,  d iagnos is  
is guaranteed  to be prec i se  and robust  enouqh 
and er ror  ant i c ipat ion  eventua l ly  may be 
renounced  complete ly .  In o rder  to y ie ld  an 
e f f i c ient  imp lementat ion  of the idea  in to  a 
pract i ca l  so lu t ion  a preponderant ly  data  
dr iven  procedure  ins tead  of a s t r i c t ly  
hypotheses  dr iven  one seems to be des i rab le .  
A procedure  of th is  k ind }\]as been  success -  
fu l l y  pursued  in an ear l ie r  paper  on the 
d iagnos is  of agreement  e r ro rs  in f i xed  syn-  
tac t i c  env i ronments  (Menze l  1988) .  Qui te  
natura l ly  th is  success  ra i ses  the quest ion  on 
how much of the exper ience  gathered  can be 
t rans fer red  to o ther  types  of g rammat ica l  
regu lar i t ies  as l inear  o rder ing  pr inc ip les  or 
dominance  regu lar i t ies ,  for  ins tance .  
Up to now the on ly  notab le  except ion  to 
the one-s ided  or ientat ion  on er ror  ant i c ipa -  
t ion  has been  a fa i l - so f t  techn ique  imp le -  
mented  in the er ror  sens i t i ve  pars ing  sys tem 
L inger  (Barehan e ta l .  1986),  an approach  
wh ich  la ter  has been  named "word  soup  heur i s -  
t ics"  by the i r  authors :  Whenever  the normal  
pars ing  process  based  on a pr inc ipa l ly  ant i c -  
ipat ion -or iented  context - f ree  grammar  fai ls ,  
the sys tem at tempts  to ach ieve  a success fu l  
parse  by t ry ing  s ing le  word  fo rm subst i tu -  
t ions, inser t ions ,  de le t ions  or d i sp lace -  
ments. A l though o f ten  be ing  very  use fu l  in 
detect ing  s imple  f laws  of the s tudent ,  th is  
heur i s t i cs  not so in f requent ly  produces  
ra ther  surpr i s ing  and somet imes  even  funny  
i n terpretat ions  of the input data. Its main  
drawback  is the basic l im i ta t ion  to on ly  
s ing le  word fo rm errors .  Any  extens ion  to the 
hand l ing  of complete  const i tuents ,  des i rab le  
as it may be, seems to be condemned to fa i l -  
ure because  of e f f i c leney  reasons:  the who le  
approach  is bas ica l ly  expectat ion  dr iven  and 
it opens  up too vast  a search  space  of poss i -  
ble e r ro r  hypotheses ,  where  the ver i f i ca t ion  
of on l~ a s ing le  one is not just  a t r i v ia l  
task. 
I. MODEL-BASED D IAGNOSIS  
The in t r ins ic  p rob lem wi th  the d iagnos is  
of s t ruc tura l  e r ro rs  is its not f i t t ing  eas i -  
ly in to  the s tandard  parad igm of mode l -based  
reason ing  wh ich  essent ia l l y  re l ies  on two 
bas ic  assumpt ions  (Re i te r  1987): 
(1 )  A mode l  a \ ]ways  has an a pr io r i  g iven  
number  of e lementary  mode l  components .  
(2) The in tercomponent  connect ions  of the 
model  are invarzant  and, l i kewise ,  g iven  
a pr ior i .  
Accord ing ly ,  model - -based d iagnos is  p r imar i l y  
shou ld  be app l i cab le  to domains  w i th  a f i xed  
and known s t ruc ture ,  wh ich  is typ ica l  for 
e.~. e lec t ron ic  t roub leshoot ing ,  the or ig in  
of the approach .  P rov is ion  can be taken  for 
these  premises  to be fu l f i l l ed  in a r t i f i c ia l -  
ly l im i ted  domains  of natura l  l anguage,  e.g. 
for agreement  e r ro rs  C c.f. Menze l  1988). It, 
more natura l  env i ronments  of language produc-  
tion. however ,  they  do not hold. Pars ing  a 
natura l  \].anguage sentence  f i r s t  of al l  is 
so lv ing  the task  of s t ruc tura l  ident i f i ca -  
tion. There fore ,  d lagnos ing  arb i t ra ry  syntac -  
tic e r ro rs  in a rb i t ra ry  u t te rances ,  f rom th is  
po in t  of view, may perhaps  be compared  w i th  
e lec t ron ic  t roub leshoot ing  in a c i rcu i t ry  o? 
obscure  funct ion  w i th  at leas t  par t ia l l y  
unknown components  and par t ia l l y  inv i s ib le  
w i r ing  under  the add i t iona l  assumpt ion  that 
there  is no poss ib i l i ty  to vary  the cond i -  
t ions  of measurement !  It shou ld  go w i thout  
say ing  that such  a task  can  on ly  be so lved  in 
very  l im i ted  domains  re ly ing  on an as s t rong  
as poss ib le  ( semant ic )  suppor t  f rom the s i tu -  
a t iona l  and sentent ia l  context .  The f ina l  
goal, of course,  shou ld  be an as fa r - reach ing  
as poss ib le  in tegrat ion  of s t ruc tura l  ident i -  
f i ca t ion  and d iagnos is .  
Mode l -based  d iagnos is ,  espec ia l l y  for  
teach ing  purposes  where  comprehens ib le  e r ro r  
exp lanat ions  are des i red ,  poses  two add i t ion -  
al const ra in ts  on the k ind of mode l  in fo rma-  
t ion  to be used. Both  cond i t ions ,  if compared  
aga ins t  usua l  pars ing  grammars ,  cer ta in ly  are 
not a mat ter  of course:  
(3) The mode l  has to p rov ide  an ext remely  
re l iab le  cor rec t / incor rec t  d i s t inc t ion ,  
whereas  t rad i t iona l  g rammars ,  in the hope 
that  ungrammat ica l  sentences  wi l l  not 
appear  as input,  msss ivs l~  re ly  on over -  
generat ion .  
(4) An expl ic i t  representat ion  based on com- 
prehens ib le  genera l i za t ions  has to be 
422 i 
at tempted  for  a max imum of  regu lar i t ies  
in the domain,  in o rder  to a l low th is  
in fo rmat ion  to be used  immediate ly  for 
exp lanat ion  purposes .  
The la t te r  cond i t ion  in most  cases  de f in i te ly  
ru les  out s imp le  l i s t s  of a I te rnat ive  so lu -  
t ions  as a proper  means  of represent ing  mode l  
in fo rmat ion .  To code, for  ins tance ,  word  
order  regu lar i t ies  as a l i s t  of poss ib le  
permutat ions  g ives  no sens ib le  e r ro r  exp lana-  
t ion  bes ides ,  say, "Your  const i tuent  o rder  is 
not conta ined  in the l i s t  of admiss ib le  con-  
s t i tuent  sequences" .  What  is des i red  ins tead  
of th is  wou ld  be an exp lanat ion ,  based  on 
exp l i c i t  genera l i za t ions  as in "The verba l  
g roup  of German subord inate  c lauses  has 
a lways  to be p laced  in f ina l  pos i t ion" .  
A f i r s t  a t tempt  to make  word  order  regu-  
la r i t ies  exp l i c i t  has been  made by us ing  
ID /LP  fo rmat  for  GPSG (Gazdar  et al 1985). 
For d iagnost ie  purposes  such  exp l i c i tness  is 
not on ly  necessary  w i th  respect  to l inear  
o rder  p r inc ip les  but w i th  respect  to omiss i -  
b i l i ty  and combinab i l i ty  of ca tegor ies  as 
well. It shou ld  resu l t  in a c lear  d i s t inc t ion  
between a ra ther  s imp le  not ion  of dominance  
ru les  and a c .omparat ive ly  r i ch  set of var ious  
const ra in ts  over  dominance  s t ruc tures .  
I I .  DOMINANCE STRUCTURES 
In i ts most  s imp le  case a dominance  ru le  
A - ->  Bt ,B2  . . . . .  B.  
s ta tes  the ab i l i ty  of ca tegory  A to dominate  
all  sequences  of ca tegor ies  wh ich  are a rb i -  
t ra ry  permutat ions  of l i s t  L=(B~. B~ .... .  B,) 
or of any  not  empty  sub l i s t  of L. Accord ing  
to th is  de f in i t ion ,  a dominance  ru le  can  
eas i ly  be in terpreted  as a d i s junct ion  of 
e lementary  and independent  ( loca l )  dominance  
re la t ions  dom\[ X, Y\] and each  category  in l i s t  
L represents  an opt iona l  const i tuent :  
or\[ dom\[ A, B~ \] , don\[ A, B2} ... . .  dom\[ A, B, \] \] , 
or in a shor thand notat ion :  
or \ [  Bs , B2 . . . . .  B.  \] . 
If a h igh ly  p rec i se  and exp l i c i t  representa -  
t ion  of dominance  regu lar i t ies  (accord ing  to 
cond i t ion  (3) and (4)) is a imed at, th is  
s imp le  ru le  fo rmat  is obv ious ly  not su f f i -  
c ient.  It does  not even  a l low the usua l  
d i s t inc t ion  between opt iona l  and ob l igatory  
e lements  in the l i s t  of dominated  nodes,  and 
espec ia l l y  for  the purpose  of mode l -based  
d iagnos is  a fu r ther  re f inement  is inev i tab le .  
Obv ious ly ,  a min ima l  fo rmal  base  shou ld  
conta in  at leas t  an exp l i c i t  descr ip t ion  of 
the somet imes  ra ther  in t r i ca te  compat ib i l i ty  
cond i t ions  between e lementary  dominance  re la -  
t ions,  e.g. by means  of p ropos i t iona l  expres -  
sions. In o rder  to y ie ld  a s imp le  d iagnos is  
p rocedure ,  the complex i ty  of admiss ib\ ] .e  ex- 
p ress ions  has to be care fu l l y  res t r i c ted .  For  
a good  number  of cases  a con junct ive  combina-  
t ion  of e lementary  (usua l ly  b inary)  expres -  
s ions  is a l ready  su f f i c ient .  Such  e lementary  
express ions  then  can be in terpreted  as add i -  
t iona l  const ra in ts  for  the s imu l taneous  ap- 
pearence  of ca tegor ies  w i th in  a const i tuent  
in a very  s imi la r  way  as agreement  and word  
order  const ra in ts  res t r i c t  the compat ib i l i ty  
of in f lec ted  fo rms or the sequenc ing  of ca te -  
gor ies .  
Most  o f ten  needed are compat ib i l i ty  con-  
s t ra in ts  to descr ibe  an a l te rnat ive  (exor)  ~ 
an imp l i ca t ion  (if) or an equ iva lence  ( i f f)  
of dominance  re la t ions .  Add i t iona l ly ,  a dom-  
in'ante re la t ion  can  be made ob l igatory ,  if it 
is s imp ly  spec i f ied  as a s ing le  e lement  in 
the con junct ion  of const ra in ts .  Hence, by 
choos ing  a sens ib le  spec i f i ca t ion  of con-  
s t ra in ts  opt iona l i ty  or ob l igator iness  can  
eas i ly  be expressed  as spec ia l  eases. In the 
s imp le  noun  phrase  
NP ---> Dot, Ad j ,Noun 
the determiner  and the noun can be ind icated  
as ob l igatory  by add ing  the const ra in ts :  
and\[ Det, Noun\] 
whereby  the ad jec t ive  remains  opt iona l .  
A more  ambi t ious  example  cou ld  be the 
German loca l  p repos i t iona l  phrase  PP 
PP --> Prep-3,  P rep-3 -Det ,  Det, Adv, Ad j ,Noun 
wh ich  a l lows  in add i t ion  to the usua l  dat ive  
prepos i t ions  (P rep-3)  the fus ion  of p repos i -  
t ion  and determiner  (P rep-3 -Det )  wh ich  is 
very  common not on ly  in spoken  German 
( "an" + "den" = "am", "in" + "das"  = "ins",  
etc.).  The add i t iona l  const ra in ts  
and\[ exor\[ Prep-3,  P rep-3 -Det \ ]  , or\[ Adj, Noun\] , 
if f\[ Prep-3,  Det\] , if\[ Adv, Adj\] \] 
p rov ide  for a p repos i t iona l  phrase  to conta in  
one and on ly  one prepos i t ion  and exact ly  one 
determiner ,  independent ly  of be ing  fused  or 
not. Ad jec t ive  and noun both  are opt iona l  
(but  not s imu l taneous ly )  and  the admiss ib i l i~  
ty of an a t t r ibut ive  adverb  depends  on the 
ex is tence  of the mod i f ied  ad jec t ive .  
To descr ibe  the omiss ib i l i ty  of dominated  
nodes  (e.g. for  the determiner )  a rb i t ra ry  
e lementary  log ica l  cond i t ions  (e. g. for  the 
presence  or absence  of cer ta in  semant ic  fea-  
tures) may be inc luded  in to  the set of con-  
s t ra in ts .  
Th is  s imp le  fo rmal  f ramework  cer ta in ly  is 
not su f f i c ient  to wr i te  complex  grammars .  
Never the less ,  it can serve  to bu i ld  t iny  
(but  non- t r iv ia l )  spec ia l i zed  grammars  cover -  
ing e.g. s imp le  types  of ma in  or subord inate  
c lauses ,  ex tended noun phrases  w i th  le f t  
and /or  r ight  a t t r ibutes  etc. wh ich  then  meet  
the ra ther  s t rong  precond i t ions  for  an app l i -  
ca t ion  of mode l -based  d iagnos is  techn iques .  
III. D IAGNOSIS  
Accord ing  to the s t rong  b ias  w i th in  the 
descr ip t ive  f ramework  towards  cons is tency  
const ra in ts ,  the bu lk  of s tudent  e r ro rs  wi l l  
have to be d iagnosed  as cons is tency  v io la -  
t ions. For  that  purpose  a const ra in t  p ropaga-  
t ion  procedure  based  on const ra in t  re t rac t ion  
or, l og ica l ly  s t ronger ,  const ra in t  negat ion  
can  be used. It is th is  k ind  of p rocedure  by 
wh ich  agreement  e r ro rs  ear l ie r  have been  
tack led  success fu l l y .  Now it tu rns  out that  
l inear  o rder ing  pr inc ip les  can be hand led  in 
a qu i te  s imi la r  way. The on ly  ser ious  d is -  
t inc t ion  is the or ig in  of fac tua l  in fo rma-  
tion: Whereas  for  agreement  it is taken  f rom 
the d ic t ionary  (morpho-syntact i c  features ) ,  
for word  order  it is g iven  as a pos i t ion  
number  in the input  sequence  chosen  by the 
s tudent .  
Mutua l  const i tuent  incompat ib i l i ty  and the 
omiss ion  of ob l igatory  const i tuents  are d iag -  
2 423 
nosed  as v io la t ions  o? the above  ment ioned  
const ra in ts .  Const ra in t  negat ion  as  bas ic  
d iagnost i c  techn ique  is a comparat ive ly  s im-  
ple procedure  in the case  of e.g. d i s3unct ion  
and imp l i ca t ion .  In both  cases  the reason  for 
the const ra in t  v io la t ion  is unique.  More  
a t tent ion  requ i res  e.g. the v io la t ion  of an 
a l te rnat ive  where  two eases  (wh ich  resu l t  in 
two d i f fe rent  exp lanat ion  var iants )  have to 
be proper ly  d i s t ingu ished:  None of the re- 
qu i red  categor ies  has been  detected  vs. both  
categor ies  appear  s imu l taneous ly .  
Combinator ia l  p rob lems ar i se  out of the 
t rans i t i v i ty  p roper ty  o? some const ra in ts .  
Th is  is typ ica l  for  agreement  const ra in ts  and 
in most  cases  it ru les  out a loca l  dec is ion  
upon a par t i cu la r  e r ror  hypothes is .  Add i t ion -  
al d i f f i cu l t ies  a r i se  out of ( lega l  or i l l e -  
gal) const i tuent  omiss ions ,  where  const ra in t  
p ropagat ion  has to take  in to  cons iderat ion  a 
( loca l ly  l im i ted)  t rans i t i ve  c losure  of con-  
s t ra in t  re la t ions .  
IV. PARS ING AS CONSTRAINT  SAT ISFACT ION?  
Sh i f t ing  J n fo rmat ion  f rom t rad i t iona l  syn-  
tac t i c  ru les  in to  add i t iona l  const ra in ts  
makes  pars ing  an increas ing ly  d i f f i cu l t  en-- 
te rpr i se .  Va luab le  in fo rmat ion  usua l ly  used  
to reduce  the search  space  has been  lost. 
Wi th  the bas ic  c le f}hi ( ion of dominance  to 
be a d i s junct ive  combinat ion  of potent ia l  
dominance  re la t ions  a grammar  carl be inter-- 
p re ted  as an OR- t ree  and s t ruc tura l  identifi-- 
ca t ion  (pars ing)  becomes  a procedure  o? arts-- 
ch ina  a l l  the categor ies  occur r ing  in the 
input  sequence  to cor respond ing  leaves  of the 
grammar, tree. Th ls ,  of course,  res t r i c ts  
p ract iea~ so Ja t Jons  to f in i te  t rees~ i.e. 
~,onrecursl  ve dominance  re la t ions .  For non-- 
reeurs ive  re la t ions  the search  space  become~ 
f in i te  but rema~ n5 never the less  e~tremelw 
large. Egen  fo~'  very  smal l  g rammars  maliy 
combinat ions  of ca tegory  a t tachments  exist ,  
each  of wh ich  s tands  for  a separate  con-  
s t ra in t  sa t i s fac t ion  prob lem,  wh ich  to solve,  
under  normal  c i rcumstances ,  aga in  requ i res  a 
combinator ia l  p rocedure .  
Hence. a fu r ther  d ras t i c  reduct ion  of the 
search  space  has to be ach ieved  by means  of 
d i f fe rent  heur i s t i cs :  
I .  Cer ta in  compat ib i l i ty  const ra in ts  wh ich  
are un l ike ly  to be v io la ted  by the s tudent  
(e. g. two prepos i t ions  in a s ing le  PP) can  
be made impl i c i t .  In  that  case, they  can-  
not be v io la ted  and consequent ly  not be 
used  for  exp lanatory  purposes .  They  can, 
however ,  be wel l  used  to exc lude  sense less  
category  a t tachments .  
S ince  th i s  heur i s t i cs  o f ten  app l ies  for  
c lear ly  a l te rnat ive  dominance  re la t ions ,  
the t ree  of dominance  poss ib i l i t i es  gets  
an imp l i c i t  o r /exor -s t ruc ture .  A very  
s imi la r  techn ique  can  be app l ied  for  op- 
t iona l  subord inated  const i tuents ,  where  
the subord inated  const i tuent  shou ld  be 
accepted  only, if at leas t  someth ing  of of 
the dominat ing  const i tuent  has been  iden-  
t i f ied.  
2. Exc lus ion  of use less  permutat ions  dur ing  
category  a t tachment  to the grammar  t ree  by 
max imis ing  a loca l i ty  measure .  Th is  heu-  
r i s t i cs  fa i l s  sys temat ica l ly  in case  of 
cer ta in  embedded const i tuents ,  where  it 
p re fers  to a t tach  e.g. a determiner  to the 
embedded noun phrase  ins tead  of ass ign ing  
it to the more  d i s tant  noun. 
3. Reuse  of par t ia l  resu l t s  gu ided  by a 
c lus ter ing  of funct iona l ly  d i f fe rent  con-  
s t i tuents  accord ing  to the i r  s t ruc tura l  
equ iva lence ,  e.g. NPs, PPs etc. 
4. Data  dr iven  best  f i r s t  ana lys i s .  
For s imp le  grammars  (of  the above  ment ioned  
complex i ty )  these  heur i s t i cs  usua l ly  reduce  
the ambigu i ty  of a t tachment  to on ly  a few 
read ings  wh ich  remain  to be passed  to the 
cons is tency  check. S ince  even  very  s imple  
grammars  o f ten  are qu i te  su f f i c ient  for  lan-  
guage  learn ing  purposes ,  indeed a k ind  o? 
res t r i c ted ,  but never the less  use fu l  pars ing  
sys tem main ly  based  on const ra in t  sa t i s fac -  
t ion  techn iques  can  be dev ised.  Th is  at leas t  
a l lows  to cons iderab ly  so f ten  the s t rong  
l im i ta t ions  of the approach  in Menze l  (1988) ,  
wh ich  are imposed by the res t r i c t ion  to f i xed  
syntact i c  env i ronments .  Cons ider ing  however  
the rap id ly  g rowing  search  space  requ i red  for 
more  complex  models ,  an extens ion  of the 
approach  to the leve l  of a un iversa l  g rammar  
obv ious ly  is not feas ib le .  
As a resu l t  Of the \].imits of a s imp le  
mode\], a few types  o? er rors  cannot  be d iag-
