Abstract
Children learn a robust representation of
lexical categories at a young age. We pro-
pose an incremental model of this process
which efficiently groups words into lexi-
cal categories based on their local context
using an information-theoretic criterion.
We train our model on a corpus of child-
directed speech from CHILDES and show
that the model learns a fine-grained set
of intuitive word categories. Furthermore,
we propose a novel evaluation approach
by comparing the efficiency of our induced
categories against other category sets (in-
cluding traditional part of speech tags) in
a variety of language tasks. We show the
categories induced by our model typically
outperform the other category sets.
1 The Acquisition of Lexical Categories
Psycholinguistic studies suggest that early on chil-
dren acquire robust knowledge of the abstract lex-
ical categories such as nouns, verbs and deter-
miners (e.g., Gelman & Taylor, 1984; Kemp et
al., 2005). Children?s grouping of words into
categories might be based on various cues, in-
cluding phonological and morphological proper-
ties of a word, the distributional information about
its surrounding context, and its semantic features.
Among these, the distributional properties of the
local context of a word have been thoroughly stud-
ied. It has been shown that child-directed speech
provides informative co-occurrence cues, which
can be reliably used to form lexical categories
(Redington et al, 1998; Mintz, 2003).
The process of learning lexical categories by
children is necessarily incremental. Human lan-
guage acquisition is bounded by memory and pro-
cessing limitations, and it is implausible that hu-
mans process large volumes of text at once and
induce an optimum set of categories. Efficient on-
line computational models are needed to investi-
gate whether distributional information is equally
useful in an online process of word categoriza-
tion. However, the few incremental models of
category acquisition which have been proposed
so far are generally inefficient and over-sensitive
to the properties of the input data (Cartwright &
Brent, 1997; Parisien et al, 2008). Moreover, the
unsupervised nature of these models makes their
assessment a challenge, and the evaluation tech-
niques proposed in the literature are limited.
The main contributions of our research are
twofold. First, we propose an incremental en-
tropy model for efficiently clustering words into
categories given their local context. We train our
model on a corpus of child-directed speech from
CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000) and show that the
model learns a fine-grained set of intuitive word
categories. Second, we propose a novel evalua-
tion approach by comparing the efficiency of our
induced categories against other category sets, in-
cluding the traditional part of speech tags, in a va-
riety of language tasks. We evaluate our model on
word prediction (where a missing word is guessed
based on its sentential context), semantic inference
(where the semantic properties of a novel word are
predicted based on the context), and grammatical-
ity judgment (where the syntactic well-formedness
of a sentence is assessed based on the category la-
bels assigned to its words). The results show that
the categories induced by our model can be suc-
cessfully used in a variety of tasks and typically
perform better than other category sets.
1.1 Unsupervised Models of Category
Induction
Several computational models have used distri-
butional information for categorizing words (e.g.
Brown et al, 1992; Redington et al, 1998; Clark,
2000; Mintz, 2002). The majority of these mod-
182
els partition the vocabulary into a set of optimum
clusters (e.g., Brown et al, 1992; Clark, 2000).
The generated clusters are intuitive, and can be
used in different tasks such as word prediction
and parsing. Moreover, these models confirm the
learnability of abstract word categories, and show
that distributional cues are a useful source of in-
formation for this purpose. However, (i) they cat-
egorize word types rather than word tokens, and
as such provide no account of words belonging to
more than one category, and (ii) the batch algo-
rithms used by these systems make them implau-
sible for modeling human category induction. Un-
supervised models of PoS tagging such as Gold-
water & Griffiths (2007) do assign labels to word-
tokens, but they still typically use batch process-
ing, and what is even more problematic, they hard-
wire important aspects of the model, such as the
final number of categories.
Only few previously proposed models process
data incrementally, categorize word-tokens and do
not pre-specify a fixed category set. The model
of Cartwright & Brent (1997) uses an algorithm
which incrementally merges word clusters so that
a Minimum Description Length criterion for a
template grammar is optimized. The model treats
whole sentences as contextual units, which sacri-
fices a degree of incrementality, as well as making
it less robust to noise in the input.
Parisien et al (2008) propose a Bayesian clus-
tering model which copes with ambiguity and ex-
hibits the developmental trends observed in chil-
dren (e.g. the order of acquisition of different cat-
egories). However, their model is overly sen-
sitive to context variability, which results in the
creation of sparse categories. To remedy this is-
sue they introduce a ?bootstrapping? component
where the categories assigned to context words are
use to determine the category of the current target
word. They also perform periodical cluster reorga-
nization. These mechanisms improve the overall
performance of the model when trained on large
amounts of training data, but they complicate the
model with ad-hoc extensions and add to the (al-
ready considerable) computational load.
What is lacking is an incremental model of lex-
ical category which can efficiently process natu-
ralistic input data and gradually build robust cate-
gories with little training data.
1.2 Evaluation of the Induced Categories
There is no standard and straightforward method
for evaluating the unsupervised models of cate-
gory learning (see Clark, 2003, for discussion).
Many unsupervised models of lexical category ac-
quisition treat the traditional part of speech (PoS)
tags as the gold standard, and measure the accu-
racy and completeness of their induced categories
based on how closely they resemble the PoS cate-
gories (e.g. Redington et al, 1998; Mintz, 2003;
Parisien et al, 2008). However, it is not at all
clear whether humans form the same types of cate-
gories. In fact, many language tasks might benefit
from finer-grained categories than the traditional
PoS tags used for corpus annotation.
Frank et al (2009) propose a different, automat-
ically generated set of gold standard categories for
evaluating an unsupervised categorization model.
The gold-standard categories are formed accord-
ing to ?substitutability?: if one word can be re-
placed by another and the resulting sentence is still
grammatical, then there is a good chance that the
two words belong to the same category. They ex-
tract 3-word frames from the training data, and
form the gold standard categories based on the
words that appear in the same frame. They em-
phasize that in order to provide some degree of
generalization, different data sets must be used for
forming the gold-standard categories and perform-
ing the evaluation. However, the resulting cate-
gories are bound to be incomplete, and using them
as gold standard inevitably favors categorization
models which use a similar frame-based principle.
All in all, using any set of gold standard cate-
gories for evaluating an unsupervised categoriza-
tion model has the disadvantage of favoring one
set of principles and intuitions over another; that
is, assuming that there is a correct set of cate-
gories which the model should converge to. Al-
ternatively, automatically induced categories can
be evaluated based on how useful they are in per-
forming different tasks. This approach is taken by
Clark (2000), where the perplexity of a finite-state
model is used to compare different category sets.
We build on this idea and propose a more gen-
eral usage-based approach to evaluating the auto-
matically induced categories from a data set, em-
phasizing that the ultimate goal of a category in-
duction model is to form categories that can be ef-
ficiently used in a variety of language tasks. We
argue that for such tasks, a finer-grained set of cat-
183
egories might be more appropriate than the coarse-
grained PoS categories. Therefore, we propose a
number of tasks for which we compare the perfor-
mance based on various category sets, including
those induced by our model.
2 An Incremental Entropy-based Model
of Category Induction
A model of human category acquisition should
possess two key features:
? It should process input as it arrives, and incre-
mentally update the current set of clusters.
? The set of clusters should not be fixed in ad-
vance, but rather determined by the charac-
teristics of the input data.
We propose a simple algorithm which fulfills those
two conditions.
Our goal is to categorize word usages based on
the similarity of their form (the content) and their
surrounding words (the context). While grouping
word usages into categories, we attempt to trade
off two conflicting criteria. First, the categories
should be informative about the properties of their
members. Second, the number and distribution of
the categories should be parsimonious. An appro-
priate tool for formalizing both informativeness
and parsimony is information-theoretic entropy.
The parsimony criterion can be formalized as
the entropy of the random variable (Y ) represent-
ing the cluster assignments:
H(Y ) = ?
NX
i=1
P (Y = yi) log2(P (Y = yi)) (1)
where N is the number of clusters and P (Y = yi)
stands for the relative size of the ith cluster.
The informativeness criterion can be formalized
as the conditional entropy of training examples
(X) given the cluster assignments:
H(X|Y ) =
NX
i=1
P (Y = yi)H(X|Y = yi) (2)
and H(X|Y = yi) is calculated as
H(X|Y = yi) = ?
TX
j=1
[P (X = xj |Y = yi)
? log2(P (X = xj |Y = yi)] (3)
where T is the number of word usages in the train-
ing set.
The two criteria presented by Equations 1 and
2 can be combined together as the joint entropy of
the two random variables X and Y :
H(X,Y ) = H(X|Y ) +H(Y ) (4)
For a random variableX corresponding to a sin-
gle feature, minimizing the joint entropyH(X,Y )
will trade off our two desired criteria.
The joint entropy will be minimal if each dis-
tinct value of variable X is assigned the same cat-
egory (i.e. same value of Y ). There are many
assignments which satisfy this condition. They
range from putting all values of X in a single cat-
egory, to having a unique category for each unique
value of X . We favor the latter solution algorith-
mically by creating a new category in case of ties.
Finally, since our training examples contain a
bundle of categorical features, we minimize the
joint entropy simultaneously for all the features.
We consider our training examples to be vectors
of random variables (Xj)Mj=1, where each random
variable corresponds to one feature. For an incom-
ing example we will choose the cluster assignment
which leads to the least increase in the joint en-
tropy H(Xj , Y ), summed over all the features j:
MX
j=1
H(Xj , Y ) =
MX
j=1
?
H(Xj |Y ) +H(Y )
?
(5)
=
MX
j=1
?
H(Xj |Y )
?
+M ?H(Y )
In the next section, we present an incremental
algorithm which uses this criterion for inducing
categories from a sequence of input data.
The Incremental Algorithm. For each word us-
age that the model processes at time t, we need to
find the best category among the ones that have
been formed so far, as well as a potential new cat-
egory. The decision is made based on the change
in the function
?M
j=1H(Xj , Y ) (Equation 5) from
point t ? 1 to point t, as a result of assigning the
current input xt to a category y:
?Hty =
MX
j=1
?
Hty(Xj , Y )?H
t?1(Xj , Y )
?
(6)
whereHty(X,Y ) is the joint entropy of the assign-
ment Y for the input X = {x1, . . . , xt}, after the
last input item xt is assigned to the category y.
The winning category y? is the one that leads to the
smallest increase. Ties are broken by preferring a
new category.
y? =
(
argminy?{y}Ni=1 ?H
t
y if ?yn[?H
t
yn < ?H
t
yN+1 ]
yN+1 otherwise
(7)
184
where N is the number of categories created up to
point t, and yN+1 represents a new category.
Efficiency. We maintain the relative size P t(y)
and the entropy H(Xj |Y = y) for each category
y over time. When performing an assignment of xt
to a category yi, we only need to update the condi-
tional entropies H(Xj |Y = yi) for all features Xj
for this particular category, since other categories
have not changed. For a feature Xj at point t, the
change in the conditional entropy for the selected
category yi is given by:
?Htyi(Xj |Y ) = H
t
yi(Xj |Y )?H
t?1(Xj |Y )
=
X
yk 6=yi
?
P (Y = yk)H
t?1(Xj |Y = yi)
?
? P t?1(Y = yi)H
t?1(X|Y = yi)
? P t(Y = yi)H
t(Xj |Y = yi)
where only the last term depends on the current
time index t. Therefore, the entropy H(Xj |Y ) at
each step can be efficiently updated by calculating
this term for the modified category at that step.
A number of previous studies have considered
entropy-based criteria for clustering (e.g. Barbara?
et al, 2002; Li et al, 2004). The main contri-
bution of our proposed model is the emphasis on
rarely explored combination of the two character-
istics we consider crucial for modeling human cat-
egory acquisition, incrementality and an open set
of clusters.
3 Experimental Setup
We evaluate the categories formed by our model
through three different tasks. The first task is word
prediction, where a target word is predicted based
on the sentential context it appears in. The second
task is to infer the semantic properties of a novel
word based on its context. The third task is to as-
sess the grammaticality of a sentence tagged with
category labels. We run our model on a corpus of
child-directed speech, and use the categories that it
induces from that corpus in the above-mentioned
tasks. For each task, we compare the performance
using our induced categories against the perfor-
mance using other category sets. In the follow-
ing sections, we describe the properties of the data
sets used for training and testing the model, and
the formation of other category sets against which
we compare our model.

Table 1: Experimental data
3.1 Input Data
We use the Manchester corpus (Theakston et al,
2001) from CHILDES database (MacWhinney,
2000) as experimental data. The Manchester cor-
pus consists of conversations with 12 children be-
tween the ages of eighteen months to three years
old. The corpus is manually tagged using 60 PoS
labels. We use the mother?s speech from tran-
scripts of 6 children, remove punctuation, and con-
catenate the corresponding sessions.
We used data from three sessions as the training
set, two sessions as the development set, and two
sessions as the test set. We discarded all one-word
sentences from the data sets, as they do not pro-
vide any context for our evaluation tasks. Table 1
summarizes the properties of each data set.
3.2 Category Sets
We define each word usage in the training or test
data set as a vector of three categorical features:
the content feature (i.e., the focus word in a us-
age), and two context features (i.e. the preceding
and following bigrams). We ran our clustering al-
gorithm on the training set, which resulted in a
set of 944 categories (of which 442 have only one
member). Table 3 shows two sample categories
from the training set, and Figure 1 shows the size
distribution of the categories.
For each evaluation task, we use the following
category sets to label the test set:
?H. The categories induced by our entropy-
based model from the training set, as de-
scribed above.
PoS. The part-of-speech tags the Manchester cor-
pus is annotated with.
Words. The set of all the word types in the data
set (i.e. assuming that all the usages of the
same word form are grouped together).
Parisien. The induced categories by the model of
Parisien et al (2008) from the training set.

gory is shown in parentheses.
For the first two tasks (word prediction and se-
mantic inference), we do not use the content fea-
ture in labeling the test set, since the assumption
underlying both tasks is that we do not have ac-
cess to the form of the target word. Therefore,
we do not measure the performance of these tasks
on the Words category set. However, we do use
the content feature in labeling the test examples in
grammaticality judgment.
For completeness, in Table 2 we report the
results of evaluation against Gold PoS tags us-
ing two metrics, Variation of Information (Meila,
2003) and Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert & Arabie,
1985).
4 Word Prediction
Humans can predict a word based on the context it
is used in with remarkable accuracy (e.g. Lesher et
al., 2002). Different versions of this task such as
Cloze Test (Taylor, 1953) are used for the assess-
ment of native and second language learning.
We simulate this task, where a missing word is
predicted based on its context. We use each of the
category sets introduced in Section 3.2 to label a
word usage in the test set, without using the word
form itself as a feature. That is, we assume that
the target word is unknown, and find the best cat-
egory for it based only on its surrounding context.

gories based on their size
We then output a ranked list of the content feature
values of the selected category as the prediction
of the model for the target word. To evaluate this
prediction, we use the reciprocal rank of the target
word in the predicted list.
The third row of Table 4 shows the Mean Re-
ciprocal Rank (MRR) over all the word usages in
the test data across different category sets. The re-
sults show that the category labels predicted by our
model (?H) perform much better than those of
Parisien, but still not as good as the gold-standard
part of speech categories. The fact that PoS tags
are better here does not necessarily mean that the
PoS category set is better for word prediction as
such, since they are manually assigned and thus
noise-free, unlike the automatic category labels
predicted by the two models. In the second set
of experiments described below we try to factor in
the uncertainty about category assignment inher-
ent in automatic labeling.
Using only the best category output by the
model to produce word predictions is simple and
neutral; however, it discards part of the informa-
tion learned by the model. We can predict words
more accurately by combining information from
the whole ranked list of category labels.
We use the ?H model to rank the values of the
content feature in the following fashion: for the
current test usage, we rank each cluster assign-
ment y by the change in the ?Htyi function that
it causes. For each of the assignments, we com-
pute the relative frequencies P (w|yi) of each pos-
sible focus word. The final rank of the word w in
context h is determined by the sum of the cluster-

(8)
where R(yi|h)?1 is the reciprocal rank of cluster
yi for context h according to the model.
We compare the performance of the ?H model
with this word-prediction method to that of an
n-gram language model, which is an established
technique for assigning probabilities to words
based on their context. For the language model
we use several n-gram orders (n = 1 . . . 5), and
smooth the n-gram counts using absolute dis-
counting (Zhai & Lafferty, 2004). The probability
of the word w given the context h is given by the
following model of order n:
Pn(w|h) = max
`
0,
c(h,w)? d
c(h)
?
+ ?(h)Pn?1(w|h) (9)
where d is the discount parameter, c(?) is the fre-
quency count function, Pn?1 is the lower-order
back-off distribution, and ? is the normalization
factor:
?(h) =
(
1 if r(h) = 0
dr(h) 1c(h) otherwise
(10)
and r(h) is the number of distinct words that fol-
low context h in the training corpus.
In addition to the ?H model and the n-gram
language models, we also report how well words
can be predicted from their manually assigned PoS
tags from CHILDES: for each token we predict the
most likely word given the token?s true PoS tag
based on frequencies in the training data.
Table 4 summarizes the evaluation results. The
?H model can predict missing words better than
any of the n-gram language models, and even
slightly better than the true POS tags. Given the
simplicity of our clustering model, this is a very
encouraging result. Simple n-gram language mod-
els are known for providing quite a strong base-
line for word prediction; for example, Brown et
al. (1992)?s class-based language model failed to

5 Semantic Inference
Several experimental studies have shown that chil-
dren and adults can infer (some aspects of) the se-
mantic properties of a novel word based on the
context it appears in (e.g. Landau & Gleitman,
1985; Gleitman, 1990; Naigles & Hoff-Ginsberg,
1995). For example, in an experimental study by
Fisher et al (2006), two-year-olds watched as a
hand placed a duck on a box, and pointed to it as a
new word was uttered. Half of the children heard
the word presented as a noun (This is a corp!),
while half heard it as a preposition (This is acorp
my box!). After training, children heard a test sen-
tence (What else is acorp (my box)?) while watch-
ing two test events: one showed another duck be-
side the box, and the other showed a different ob-
ject on the box. Looking-preferences revealed ef-
fects of sentence context: subjects in the preposi-
tion condition interpreted the novel word as a lo-
cation, whereas those in the noun condition inter-
preted it as an object.
To study a similar effect in our model, we as-
sociate each word with a set of semantic features.
For nouns, we extract the semantic features from
WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998) as follows: We
take all the hypernyms of the first sense of the
word, and the first word in the synset of each
hypernym to the set of the semantic features of

the target word (see Figure 2 for an example).
For verbs, we additionally extract features from
a verb-specific resource, VerbNet 2.3 (Schuler,
2005). Due to lack of proper resources for other
lexical categories, we limit our evaluation to nouns
and verbs.
The semantic features of words are not used in
the formation of lexical categories. However, at
each point of time in learning, we can associate
a semantic profile to a category as the aggregated
set of the semantic features of its members: each
feature in the set is assigned a count that indicates
the number of the category members which have
that semantic property. This is done for each of
the category sets described in Section 3.2.
As in the word-prediction task, we use differ-
ent category sets to label each word usage in a test
set based only on the context features of the word.
When the model encounters a novel word, it can
use the semantic profile of the word?s labeled cat-
egory as a prediction of the semantic properties of
that word. We can evaluate the quality of this pre-
diction by comparing the true meaning represen-
tation of the target word (i.e., its set of semantic
features according to the lexicon) against the se-
mantic profile of the selected category. We use the
Mean Average Precision (MAP) (Manning et al,
2008) for comparing the ranked list of semantic
features predicted by the model with the flat set
of semantic features extracted from WordNet and
VerbNet. Average Precision for a ranked list F
with respect to a set R of correct features is:
APR(F ) =
1
|R|
|F |X
r=1
P (r)? 1R(Fr) (11)
where P (r) is precision at rank r and 1R is the
indicator function of set R.
The middle row of Table 4 shows the MAP
scores over all the noun or verb usages in the
test set, based on four different category sets. As
can be seen, the categories induced by our model
(?H) outperform all the other category sets. The
word-type categories are particularly unsuitable
for this task, since they provide the least degree
of generalization over the semantic properties of
a group of words. The categories of Parisien
et al (2008) result in a better performance than
word types, but they are still too sparse for this
task. However, the average score gained by part of
speech tags is also lower than the one by our cat-
egories. This suggests that too broad categories
are also unsuitable for this task, since they can
only provide predictions about the most general
semantic properties, such as ENTITY for nouns,
and ACTION for verbs. These findings again con-
firm our hypothesis that a finer-grained set of cat-
egories that are extracted directly from the input
data provide the highest predictive power in a nat-
uralistic language task such as semantic inference.
6 Grammaticality Judgment
Speakers of a natural language have a general
agreement on the grammaticality of different sen-
tences. Grammaticality judgment has been viewed
as one of the main criteria for measuring how
well a language is learned by a human learner.
Experimental studies have shown that children as
young as five years old can judge the grammati-
cality of the sentences that they hear, and that both
children?s and adults? grammaticality judgments
are influenced by the distributional properties of
words and their context (e.g., Theakston, 2004).
Several methods have been proposed for auto-
matically distinguishing between grammatical and
ungrammatical usages (e.g., Wagner et al, 2007).
The ?shallow? methods are mainly based on n-
gram frequencies of words or categories in a cor-
pus, whereas the ?deep? methods treat a parsing
failure as an indication of a grammatical error.
Since our focus is on evaluating our category set,
we use trigram probabilities as a measure of gram-
maticality, using Equation 9 with n = 3.
As before, we label each test sentence using dif-
ferent category sets, and calculate the probability
for each trigram in that sentence. We define the
overall grammaticality score of a sentence as the
minimum of the probabilities of all the trigrams in
that sentence. Note that, unlike the previous tasks,
here we do use the content word as a feature in
188
labeling a test word usage. The actual word form
affects the grammaticality of its usage, and this in-
formation is available to the human subjects who
evaluate the grammaticality of a sentence.
Since we know of no publicly available corpus
of ungrammatical sentences, we artificially con-
struct one: for each sentence in our test data set,
we randomly move one word to another position.1
We define the accuracy of this task as the propor-
tion of the test usages for which the model calcu-
lates a higher grammaticality score for the original
sentence than for its ungrammatical version.
The last row of Table 4 shows the accuracy of
the grammaticality judgment task across different
category sets. As can be seen, the highest accu-
racy in choosing the grammatical sentence over
the ungrammatical one is achieved by using the
PoS categories (0.728), followed by the categories
induced by our model (0.715). These levels of ac-
curacy are rather good considering that some of
the automatically generated errors are also gram-
matical (e.g., there you are vs. you are there, or
can you reach it vs. you can reach it). The results
by the other two category sets are lower and very
close to each other.
These results suggest that, unlike the semantic
inference task, the grammaticality judgment task
might require a coarser-grained set of categories
which provide a higher level of abstraction. How-
ever, taking into account that the PoS categories
are manually assigned to the test usages, the dif-
ference in their performance might be due to lack
of noise in the labeling procedure. We plan to in-
vestigate this matter in future by improving our
categorization model (as discussed in Section 7).
Also, we intend to implement more accurate ways
of estimating grammaticality, using an approach
similar to that described for word prediction task
in Section 4.
7 Discussion
We have proposed an incremental model of lexi-
cal category acquisition based on the distributional
properties of words. Our model uses an informa-
tion theoretic clustering algorithm which attempts
to optimize the category assignments of the in-
coming word usages at each point in time. The
model can efficiently process the training data, and
induce an intuitive set of categories from child-
directed speech. However, due to the incremen-

tal nature of the clustering algorithm, it does not
revise its previous decisions according to the data
that it later receives. A potential remedy would be
to consider merging the clusters that have recently
been updated, in order to allow for recovery from
early mistakes the model has made.
We used the categories induced by our model
in word prediction, inferring the semantic prop-
erties of novel words, and grammaticality judg-
ment. Our experimental results show that the per-
formance in these tasks using our categories is
comparable or better than the performance based
on the manually assigned part of speech tags in
our experimental data. Furthermore, in all these
tasks the performance using our categories im-
proves over a previous incremental categorization
model (Parisien et al, 2008). However, the model
of Parisien employs a number of cluster reorgani-
zation techniques which improve the overall qual-
ity of the clusters after processing a substantial
amount of input data. In future we plan to increase
the size of our training data, and perform a more
extensive comparison with the model of Parisien
et al (2008).
The promising results of our experiments sug-
gest that an information-theoretic approach is a
plausible one for modeling the induction of lexi-
cal categories from distributional data. Our results
imply that in many language tasks, a fine-grained
set of categories which are formed in response to
the properties of the input are more appropriate
than the coarser-grained part of speech categories.
Therefore, the ubiquitous approach of using PoS
categories as the gold standard in evaluating un-
supervised category induction models needs to be
reevaluated. To further investigate this claim, in
future we plan to collect experimental data from
human subjects performing our suggested tasks,
and measure the correlation between their perfor-
mance and that of our model.
