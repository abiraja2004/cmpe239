" 1 introduction 
Good historical surveys and comprehensive current 
state of the art surveys have already been given for 
MT by several  authors \[Bruderer 1977\] \ [Vauquo is  
\].979\] \[Nagao 1983\] \[Tucker 1984, 1985\] \[Slocum \]985a\]. 
The object ives,  the basic  design pr inc ip les  and the 
current stages of development of some of the major 
groups which aim to develop practical and reasonably 
large MT sys tems are found in the specia l  i ssues on 
MT of ACL \[Slocum 1985b\], where a comprehensive bib- 
l iography of MT f rom 1973 to 1984 is a lso given. In 
addition, \[Nishida 1985\] gives a very c lear idea of 
what is going on in Japanese MT research. 
All of these surveys show that MT has its own 
history and techniques deve loped  quite separate ly  
f rom the other research areas of natura l  language 
processing, especially the areas of natural language 
understanding (NLU Jn short). The researchers in NLU 
have repeatedly compla ined that current MT systems 
t rans late  texts w i thout  unders tand ing  them. On the 
other hand, the MT researchers have claimed that NLU 
researches have always developed 'proto-type' systems 
which  only deal  w i th  texts in s t rong ly  res t r i c ted  
subject  f ietds and cannot  be extended to cover va- 
rious linguistic phenomena found in the other fields. 
However,  it is obvious that the prob lems concerned  
with 'understanding texts' cannot be avoided for the 
future development of high quality translation sys- 
tems, and, in fact, several  exper imenta l  sys tems 
\[Carbonel\] 11.978, 81\] \[Lytinen 1982\] \ [ Ishizaki  1986\] 
\ [Nomura 1986\] aims to translate texts through 
understanding them. 
In this paper, we wil l  discuss several problems 
concerned with 'understanding and translation', espe- 
cial ly how we can integrate the two l ines of re- 
search, with their different histories and different 
techniques, into unified frameworks, and the diffi- 
cul t ies we might  encounter  in a t tempt ing  such an 
integration. The discussion wil\] reveal some of the 
reasons why MT researches are so separated from the 
research in the other application fields of NLP. We 
wi l l  also list some of the key prob lems,  both 
linguistic and computat ional ,  which we encountered  
during the deve lopment  of our MT systems, the Mu 
systems \[Nagao \]984, 85, 86\] \[Tsujii 1984, 85\] 
\ [Nakamura 1984, 86 \] \ [Sakamoto 1984\], and whose 
resolutions we consider to be of essential importance 
for future MT research and development. 
2 T rans la t ion  between J apa~\]ese and Indo-European 
Languages 
The MT research  and deve lopment  ac t iv i t ies  in 
Japan including the Mu project are distinguished from 
others in that they all aim to treat language pairs  
of qui te d i f fe rent  \ ]anguage famil ies,  i.e. Japanese  
and one of the Indo-European languages, typ ica\ ] ly  
English; most  of the ac t iv i t ies  in other parts  of 
the world, wi th  few except ions  \[Tong 1986 \] \[Loh 
1975\]\[Feng \]982\], have focused on translation among 
Indo-European \]anguages. Because Japanese is qui te 
d iE ferent  f rom Indo-European languages in var ious 
aspects such as its \ ]exica\]  items, syntact ic  and 
semantic structures, etc., the t rans \ ]a t \ ]on  process 
bas to be much more sophisticated. 
The experience of PAIIO-SPANAM \[Vasconcellos 1985\] 
shows, for example, in the translation from Spanish 
to English, that translation results sufficient for 
native speakers of Engl ish  to correct  t rans la t ion  
errors can be obtained even without having a separate 
phase (the ana lys i s  phase) of obta in ing  exp l ic i t  
representat ions  of the syntact ic  s t ruc tures  of 
source sentences. In contrast to this, because Japa- 
nese  and Eng l i sh  have  qu i te  d i f fe rent  phrase  
orderings,  resu l ts  of th.i.s s tandard  cannot be 
obtained in Japanese-English translation unless the 
entire syntact ic  s t ructure  of the source sentences 
is captured. Fur thermore ,  in Japanese-Ehg l i sh  
translat ion,  d i f fe rent  syntactic interpretations of 
source sentences  a lmost  a lways  lead to d i f fe rent  
t rans lat ions  so that we cannot expect  syntact ic  
ambigu i t ies  to be preserved  in both  languages. That 
is, a l though the METAl, group \[Beneht 1985\] reports  
that 
'We employ only the highest-scoring reading (i.e. 
syntact ic  interpretat.ion) for t rans la t ion  . . . .  
Surpr i s ing ly  often, a number  of the h igher -scor ing  
interpretations will be translated identical', 
we can rare ly  expect this to happen in t rans la t ion  
between Japanese and English. Moreover,  certa in 
syntactic concepts which are supposed to be common to 
all Indo-European languages are quite problematic in 
Japanese. For example, 
\]..We do not \]\]ave in Japanese  expl ic i t  mark ing of 
defJ nite and indef in i te  d is t inct ions  among noun 
phrases by determiners 
2.Whether the concept of syntactic subject exists in 
Japanese or not is undetermined  among Japanese 
linguists 
3.Although re lat ive clause constructions in English 
and embedded clause constructions in Japanese roughly 
correspond to each other, the two constructions have 
quite different characteristics. Japanese  embedded 
655 
c lauses  shou ld  be t rans la ted  into  many  o ther  
syntactic constructions such as (preposition + --ing\] 
forms of phrases  which modi fy  nouns, appos i t iona l  
phrases  in t roduced by 'that', etc., depend ing  on the 
semantic relationships between the modifying clauses 
(embedded clauses) and the modif ied noun \[Nagao 1984, 
1986\]. 
These  fac ts  ind icate  that  captur ing  the 
syntact ic  s t ructures  of entire source sentences  is 
necessary ,  a l though not su f f i c ient ,  for the 
translation between English and Japanese. Moreover,  
we need a certain amount of change in the syntactic 
structures of source sentences in order to generate 
natural translations. It is obvious that translation 
between all language pairs requires more or less 
structural change, but to what extent such structure 
change is necessary and to what extent such structure 
change requ i res  semant ic  or ext ra - l ingu is t i c  
know\] .edge (and so, cannot  be sys temat ica l ly  
formulated upon syntactic structures alone) is highly 
dependent on individual language pairs. Pairs such as 
Japanese and one of the Indo-European languages offer 
one of the extremes:we often have to refer to deeper 
structures than syntactic ones, such as the so-called 
semant ic  or conceptua l  st ructures of sentences,  in 
order to obtain natural translations. 
That 'deeper' understanding is relevant to high 
qua l i ty  t rans la t ions  is in tu i t i ve ly  obv ious .  
However, the discrepancy between Japanese and Indo- 
European languages is so large that even at 
certain deeper levels the discrepacy still remains; 
l. The cor respondence  of words  in the two languages,  
English and Japanese, is not so straightforward. This 
impl ies  that a set of semant ic  or conceptua l  units, 
f rom which deeper  level representat ions  of source 
sentences might  be constructed,  is d i f f i cu l t  to 
define (see Section 4). 
2.A single event in the real world is often captured 
d i f fe rent ly  in the two languages. For example,  an 
event which is expressed  in Engl ish  by a sentence 
with a transitive verb is often expressed in Japanese 
by a sentence with an intransitive verb accompanied 
by a deep cause case e lement.  Even deep semant ic  
case re la t ionsh ips  seem then to be dependent  on 
individual languages. Although more or less the same 
phenomenon has been  observed even in t rans la t ion  
among Indo-European languages (for example,  (King, 
1986\]), the difference between Japanese and the Indo- 
European languages in terms of their  deep case 
structures remains particularly large. 
These considerations have led the MT researchers 
in Japan to basic  p rob lems as to what  kinds of 
'understanding' are relevant to translation, whether 
resul ts  of 'understanding' sentences (texts) can be 
represented independently from individual languages, 
and f inally, what  'understanding' sentences can 
real ly mean. These issues should  be made clear not 
only for translations of language pairs belonging to 
quite d i f fe rent  language fami l ies  but also for 
deve lop ing  future  high qua l i ty  MT sys tems for any 
language pair. The Japanese Min is t ry  of Post  and 
Telecommunication, for example, recently announced s 
new, 15 year project for the simultaneous translation 
of te lephone communicat ion ,  in wh ich  ord inary  
d ia logues  wi l l  be translated.  We cannot  expect in 
such a system the heavy interventions of professional 
translators that most current MT systems presume. 
Raw translation results should be natural enough for 
656 
peop le  w i thout  any knowledge  of the source  
languages. 
3 Basic Approaches 
One of the recurr ing cont rovers ies  among MT 
researchers  has been between the adopt ion  of the 
t rans fer  approach  and the adopt ion  of the 
inter l ingual  approach,  and this seems ext remely  
relevant to various issues of the possible relation-- 
ships between 'understanding' and 'translation' in 
future MT systems. The transfer approach, originally 
proposed by GETA \[Vauquois1979\] and adopted by many 
research and deve lopment  groups inc lud ing  the MU 
project,  EUROTRA \[King 1981\] \[ Johnson 1985\], TAUM 
\[Kittredge 1976\] \ [ Isabel le 1985\], METAL \[S\]ocum 
1982\] \[Bennet 1985\] , PAHO-ENGSPA \ [Vasconcel los  1985\] , 
ASCOF\ [B iewer  1985\] etc., is an approach in wh ich  
t rans la t ion  is carr ied out essent ia l l y  in three 
phases: analysis, t rans fer  and generat ion.  The 
second phase, transfer, is a contrastive phase where 
lexical items, stereotyped expressions, and the syn- 
tactic and semantic structures of two languages are 
compared  so that both lexical  i tems and certa in 
levels of the l inguist ic  s t ructures  of the source 
languages may be t rans fer red  to their  'equivalents' 
in the target languages. 
The interlingual or pivot approach, which has 
been repeatedly advocated by researchers  o r ig ina l ly  
interested in natura l  language unders tand ing  (NLU) 
who take machine translation as one possible applica- 
tion \[Muraki 1982, 1986\] \[Lytinen 1982\], instead per- 
forms translation through two phases, understanding 
and paraphrasing. The results of the first phase in 
this approach  are supposed to be represented  in the 
form of express ions  of inter l ingua,  f rom wh ich  the 
second phase may generate the target sentences. The 
expressions of interlingua are language universal in 
the sense that the second phase can generate  target  
sentences f rom them wi thout  cons ider ing  what  the 
source language is. It is claimed that this approach 
is super ior  to the t rans fer  approach because of the 
follow ing advantages. 
l .Mu l t i -L ingua l  Trans lat ion:  Because this approach  
does not have any phases dependent on language pairs, 
only two kinds of modules for transforming sentences 
of individual languages to expressions of interlingua 
and vice versa are necessary for mu l t i - l i ngua l  
translations. 
2.High qua l i ty  Trans lat ion:  Because this  approach  
f irst unders tands  source sentences and then para- 
phrases the 'understanding' in the target languages, 
the t rans la t ion  results are natural  and easy to 
understand. 
Fig.\]. is a schemat ic  f igure often used for 
exp la in ing  the re la t ionsh ip  between the t rans fer  
approach and the inter l ingual  approach  \[Vauquois 
1979\] \[Tucker \]985\]. This f igure shows that there is 
an abst rac t ion  h ierarchy  of descr ip t ions  such as 
surface word sequences, surface syntactic structures, 
deep syntact ic  structures,  semant ic  structures,  
conceptual  structures, etc. where, at the deeper  
levels, the descr ip t ions  of sentences of d i f fe rent  
indiv idual  \ ]anguages become c loser  and f inal ly, at 
the deepest  level (the level of understanding),  
converge.

Which is often used but quite mis leading 
This f igure ,  however ,  is o f ten  mis lead ing  in 
that it suggests an interpretat ion where each level 
of the hierarchy may replace the shal lower  levels of 
descr ip t ion .  Th is  is to in terpret  the f igure  as 
showing  that  each  \ ]eve\ ]  Jn the h ie rarchy  can 
express in its own descr ipt ive f ramework  all aspects 
of the informat ion conveyed by source sentences: once 
a descr ip t ion  at the deeper  \].evel is ach ieved,  it 
can rep lace  the sha\] lower ,  more  sur face -or iented  
levels  of descr ip t ion .  This imp\] ies that  the 
transfer approach is more a tentative approach only 
adopted  unt i l  we deve lop  technologies for 'under- 
standing' texts and the f rameworks  for express ing the 
result of understanding, that is, interlingua. 
The ear ly  exper iences  of CETA, however ,  show 
that this naive v iew does not work well. The surface 
syntact i c  s t ruc tures  of sentences ,  fo~ example ,  
cannot  be rep laced  fu l l y  by the i r  deep  case s t ruc -  
tures,  because  sur face  s t rnc tures  convey  ext ra -  
informat ion concerned with, for example, the focus 
of the d i scourse ,  the d i s t inc t ion  of o ld /new 
in fo rmat ion  in the context ,  emphas ized  e\].ements or 
phrases ,  etc., and such  ext ra - in fo rmat ion  is a l so  
relevant to the determinat ion of the target sentence 
structures. General ly  speak ing ,  for t rans la t ion ,  we 
have to ext rac t  f rom texts,  not on ly  what  is 
descr ibed (the extra- l inguist ic  aspects of texts) but 
also how Jt is descr ibed  and how the texts  are 
organized(the l inguist ic aspects of texts) . 
The early, naive inter l ingual  approach tended to 
put emphas is  on just what  is descr ibed .  The same 
tendency  may also be observed  in some par ts  of 
l inguist ics and recent knowledge-based approaches to 
MT. F i l lmore 's  in i t ia l  not ion  of cases  \ [F i l lmore  
1968\],  for example ,  was proposed  for re ta in ing  
ident i t ies  of events  in the real  wor ld  wh ich  are 
expressed di f ferent ly in sur face  sentences ,  so that  
the sentences

are al l  reduced  to the same case s t ruc tures .  How-  
ever, even if they  descr ibe  the same real wor ld  
events,  they  descr ibe  those  events  f rom d i f fe rent  
v iew points .  At least,  the sentences  may p lay  
d i f fe rent  ro les  in d i scourse ,  and so, when they  are 
put  in a cer ta in  context ,  some of them may v io la te  
discourse coherency and be less natural than others. 
One could claim, as researchers of know ledge 
based approaches often do, that, because discourse 
ro les  of sentences  shou ld  be determined  dur ing  the 
generat ion (paraphrasing) phase by 'inte\].ligent' text 
generators, the ana lys i s  (unders tand ing)  phase  need  
not ext rac t  fac tors  re\].evant to d i scourse  f rom 
source  texts .  It is p robab ly  t rue  that  some 
dJ scourse  fac tors  and so some par ts  of sur face  
l inguist ic structure should be determined during the 
generat ion  phase  of ta rget  texts. EIowever, because  
the same sequences  of events  in the rea l  wor ld  can 
usually be descr ibed by a number of d i f ferent texts, 
each having its own coherent discourse structure, MT 
sys tems shou ld  be ab le  to se lec t  one  of them 
dynamJ  ea l ly  based  on the text  s t ruc tures  of the 
source languages. Certain factors concerned with the 
text organizat ion of the source languages should be 
ext rac ted  dur ing  the ana lys i s  phase  to fac i l i ta te  
such se lec t ion .  Otherwise ,  however  inte l l J  gent  the 
text genera lo rs  might  be, they  may a lways  generate  
the same texts  as t rans la t ions  of d i f fe rent \ ]  y 
o rgan ized  source  texts  whenever  'essent ia l ly '  the 
same sequences of events are described, albeit  from 
dif ferent v iew points and attitudes. 
A l though there are certain types of texts, such 
as 'factual' newsreporti.ng art ic les of newspapers  on 
te r ro r i sm \ [ I sh i zak i  \[986\] \ [Lyt inen 11982\] in wh ich  
only what  events  occured  in the real  wor \ ]d  and in 
what  order are J mportaut, there are, of course, far 
more var ied types of texts to be translated. \[Tucker 
\].984\] also notes this point as follows. 
'In spite of its initial appeal, the knowldge based 
approach  -- ra i ses  some we ighty  quest ions ,  for 
example ,  .... To what  degree  are the sc r ip ts  of 
know\]edge based mach ine  t rans la t ion  we l l  su i ted  to 
'non-story'  texts  such as conference  proceed ings ,  
sc ient i f ic  artic\]es, and budget documents  ?' 
There is, however, another possible interpreta- 
t ion for Fig.l. Here the h ie rarchy  is taken as a 
h ie rarchy  of the depth  of p rocess ing  dur ing  the 
analysis phase, according to what  kinds of informa- 
t ion are be ing  exp l i c i t l y  ext rac ted  f rom source  
sentences at each level \[Boitet 1984\]. In this view, 
an analysis program which per forms process ing to a 
cer ta in  level  g ives  as its output  cer ta in  s t ruc -  
tura l  descr ip t ions  (or sets  of structural  descr ip-  
t ions) wh ich  conta in  exp l i c i t  representat ions  of 
in fo rmat ion  up to that  level .  An ana lys i s  p rogram 
wh ich  processes  sentences  to the leve l  of  deep case 
s t ruc tures ,  for  example ,  outputs  cer ta in  descr ip -  
t ions  f rom wh ich  the o ther  p rogram,  the t rans fer  
program, can retr ieve informat ion of, not only deep 
case relationships, but also surface syntact ic struc- 
tures  and sur face  order ing  of the words  of input  
sentences, without any further l inguist ic processing. 
The current t ransfer-based MT systems usual ly 
s tand  on th i s  v iew, where,  based  on the deep  case  
structures and surface syntact ic structures of source 
sentences  revea led  dur ing  the ana lys i s  phase,  the 
transfer programs compute the most appropr iate cor- 
responding descr ipt ions  of  ta rget  sentences .  In the 
cuurent  t rans fer -based  sys tems,  however, d iscourse 
factors are not usually expressed expl ic i t ly  in the 
descr ip t ions  but are imp l i c i t l y  p reserved  in the 
sur face  syntact i c  s t ruc tures  wh ich  preserve  the 
surface orderings of phrases. The surface syntactic 
s t ruc tures  are then preserved  dur ing  the t rans fer  
phase as much as possibJ.e so that discourse ro\].es of 
e lements in the sentences are presumably  t ransferred 
to the target descriptions. This pr inciple of 'using 
source sentences as mou\ ]ds  of target sentences' works 
rather wel l  in translat ion among languages with many 
s imi la r i t ies  because  the syntact i c  not ions  of one 
language such as syntact ic subject often play a lmost  
the same discourse roles in the other languages. 
657 
However, though the same principle works to a 
cer ta in  extent  in the t rans la t ion  between Japanese  
and Indo-European languages, it does not work  so 
well. In the t rans la t ion  of such a language pair, 
because surface syntactic s t ruc tures  of source sen- 
tences often have to be drastically changed in order 
to realize the deep case relations in the target, the 
principle itself becomes hard to follow. In addition, 
though the principle is based on the assumption that 
syntactic notions such as syntactic subject etc. play 
the same roles in the two languages, the assumption 
is not valid. The pr inciple,  therefore,  tends to 
produce either understandable but unnatural transla- 
tions, or to make the t rans fer  component  ad-hoc, 
complex, and difficult to maintain when we attempt to 
get natural translations. Furthermore, as can easily 
be seen, the principle is not even satisfactory for 
the translation of similar languages when we want to 
get high quality translations. It is obvious that we 
have to extract explicitly more kinds of information 
from source texts than deep case structures and util- 
ize these to compute descriptions of the target sen- 
tences. 
Note that 'to extract more kinds of information 
exp l i c i t ly  dur ing  the analysis' does not, in fact, 
necessarily mean 'to express such kinds of informa- 
tion in a language independent framework' nor does it 
imply that such extracted information can fully re- 
p lace the sha l lower  levels  of descr ipt ion.  Indeed, 
because the l ingu is t ic  aspects  concerned  with 'hew 
things are described', 'how texts are organized' etc. 
are more language- in terna l  aspects  than those of 
'what are described', it is likely that they are more 
difficult to express in a language universal frame- 
work. 
Our tentative view of future MT systems, which 
is based on the transfer approach and wil l  be zevised 
in a later section, is shown in Fig.2. In this frame- 
work, the ana lys i s  phase is expected  to ext ract  ex- 
p l ic i t ly  many more d i f fe rent  kinds of information 
other than deep case relat ionships.  They are the

factors wh ich  co l lec t ive ly  determine  the surface 
syntactic structures of source sentences. We neither 
expect, as descr ibed  above, that such ext rac ted  in- 
formation should be represented in a language univer- 
sal manner, nor expect that they uniquely determine 
surface syntactic structures of source sentences. In 
this sense, they need not be a complete  set of 
factors determin ing  surface s t ruc tures  of source 
sentences and so the surface structures cannot be 
replaced by the set of these factors. They mere ly  
give us a framework which facilitates the systematic 
comparison of the two languages. Based on the set of 
these factors, the t rans fer  phase computes  corre-  
sponding factors of target sentences inc lud ing dis-  
course factors, semantic structures, syntactic struc- 
tures, etc. f rom which the generat ion  phase wi l l  
generate target surface syntactic structures. As the 
extracted factors give the transfer component a con- 
straint set which is to be satisfied if possible, the 
factors computed in the transfer give a similar set 
of cond i t ions  to be sat is f ied  in the generat ion  
phase. 
Though our current view of future MT systems is 
based on the transfer approach, our objective in this 
sect ion is not to c la im that this approach is 
super ior  to the in ter l ingua l  approach,  but only to 
c la im that the word 'understanding texts' in the 
context of MT is quite vague and, therefore, that we 
have to examine  and define what  is real ly meant  by 
the mythical word 'understanding' be fore  d i scuss ing  
the advantages  and d i sadvantages  of the two  
approaches .  In fact ,  wh i le  severa l  l a rge  and 
practical MT systems, including some commercial ly 
avai lable,  have been deve loped in Japan based on 
d i f fe rent  approaches  such as the 'Pivot approach' 
\[Muraki 1985\], 'Conceptual Transfer Approach' \[Uchida 
1980, 1985\]  \ [Amano 1985\],  ' Integrated Approach' 
\[Tanaka 1983\] , each of which puts emphas is  on di f -  
ferent aspects  of t rans lat ion processes, especially 
on aspects  of 'understanding', when one c losely  
examines the internal translation processes and what 
kinds of information are utilized in these systems, 
one in fact  f inds many s imi la r i t ies  and fewer  di f -  
ferences than one might have expected. 
Before ending this section, we would  like to 
add some comments: First of all, we neither deny the 
ex is tence of certa in  levels of unders tand ing  wh ich  
are language universal nor their importance and rel- 
evance to translat ion. On the contrary,  we are 
wil l ing to accept such claims. Our objective is only 
to claim that such levels of 'understanding results' 
should be integrated with other aspects of informa- 
tion conveyed by input texts. Second, though it is 
implicitly assumed by the researchers of the inter- 
l ingual  approaches that the t rans fer  approach  is 
incompatible with 'understanding texts', that assUmp- 
tion, as Fig.2. shows, is simply wrong. 
Translation and Understandinq 
In order to discuss the problem on a more concrete 
basis, we wi l l  f i rst  see how 'understanding of a 
sentence' has been understood in convent iona l  NLU 
frameworks. 
Fig. 3. shows a s imp l i f i ed  f ramework  of an NLU 
system. In this framework, 'understanding of a sen- 
tence' is regarded  as a process  of t rans format ion  
from an input sentence S, a linear sequence of words, 
into a mean ing  representat ion  M(S). The M(S), in

Fig.3 A Simplified Framework of an NLU 
An ordiz~ary NL front end for a data base system, 
for example, transforms sentences into expressions of 
a certain query Ianguage such as SQI,, an artificial 
language designed Ifor data base accesses. The inter- 
nal program in this case is tile SQL interpreter which 
can execute the expressions to retrieve appropriate 
data. As all ex t reme example,  the STUDENT system 
\[D.Bobrow \].968\], which solves exercises of arithme- 
tic expressed  in English, t rans forms texts into a 
simultaneous equation. In this system, the 'meaning' 
of an input text is an equation. 
Such transformation from an input to the M(S) \]s 
essentiaIly an information extraction process where 
only in fo rmat ion  re levant  to spec i f i c  tasks is ex- 
tracted; it is not an information preserving process 
in tbe sense that exact surface sentences usual ly  
cannot be re-generated from information extracted. In 
o ther  words ,  M(S) used  so far represent  the 
'meanings' of input sentences only from a certa in 
point  of view, that is, from the v iew point of 
'internal processing' for a specific task, and there- 
fore, on ly  preserve in fo rmat ion  re levant  to that 
task. Though other frameworks which have been adopted 
by NLU rese;~rchers in certa in f ields such as 'text 
understandi.ng' seem to have d i f fe rent  f lavors, the 
essent ia l  f ramework  is a lmost  the same. In these 
systems, 'understanding texts' i s taken to be a 
process  of re la t ing  texts to internal  'knowledge' 
cal led 'scripts', 'frames', 'schemas' etc. p repared  
in the systems beforehand. Knowledge in these systems 
is claimed to imitate human conceptual memory formed 
through exper iences  in the real wor ld and to be 
general  in the sense that it is independent  of spe- 
cific tasks. Such systems, however, also have their 
own tasks such as 'paraphrasing', ' summary  genera- 
tion' etc. to show their  unders tand ing  capab i l i t i es  
by external behaviour; these tasks implicitly define 
the content  and descr ip t ive  f rameworks  of their 
knowledge  so that the in fo rmat ion  to be extracted 
from texts is restr icted.  In addit ion, because the 
internal forms of knowledge to which input texts are 
re lated usua l ly  ref lect  situations (or sequences of 
events) in the real  world,  they have noth ing to do 
directly with linguistic texts. That is, 'understand- 
~ng results'  in these systems often miss the lin- 
guistic aspects of texts. 
In cont ras t  to a res t r i c ted  approach to mean ing  
extraction, however, the aim of translation Js 
Ito re-express by using sentences of target \] an- 
guages the in fo rmat ion  of all aspects  conta ined in 
sentences of source languages, with as \]east distor- 
tion as possible'. 
It is commonly recognized by l~nguists that a\]\] 
different surface sentences convey different informa- 
tion. If we share th\]s understanding,  the M(S) in 
MT should v \ ] r tua\ ] \ ]y  retain in format  ion for re- 
generating exact source sentences. That is, we do not 
have any 'internal processings' Jn MT by which we can 
define certa in  aspects  of in fo rmat ion  conveyed by 
texts. The M(.~;) of source sentences  in MT should 
preserve information of a\] \] kinds conveyed by source 
sentences,  not only  what Js descr ibed  by the texts 
but also how it is descr ibed,  f rom what  v iew po ints  
and by what  att itudes. Such cons iderat ions  have led 
us to the f ramework  a\] ready shown as Fig. 2. in this 
framework, we abandon single layers of descriptions 
for represent ing  'unders tand ing  resu l ts ' ,  and 
instead, have several layers of descriptions which 
co l lec t ive ly  determine  the surface syntactic struc- 
tures of the source sentences and which are a\]\] to 
be utilized durLng the transfer. 
Based on this assumpt ion  of the mui t i - \ ]ayered  
description o\[ source texts, we can thin\]< of certain 
\].ayers of descr ip t ion  wh ich  are language universal. 
and wh ich  cor respond to 'understanding resu\]ts '  in 
convent ional  NLU systems. We wi l l  d iscuss in the 
following sections some of the problems in util izing 
these extra-l inguistic Layers of 'understanding' in 
t rans la t ion  processes  and what  roles these layers 
shou\].d play in the preeess as a whole. 
5 Words and Concepts 
We wi l l  f i rst  examine  the basic  units from 
which complex expressions in these language independ- 
ent layers  might  be constructed.  The researchers  
advocating rla~ve interIingua\] approaches have Jn mind 
snch a v iew as shown Jn Fig. 4. In this view, each 
word of individual languages denotes a language inde- 
pendent  or ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concept,  though some 
words  are ambiguous  and denote  several  d i f fe rent  
(mutual ly  d ist ingui  shable) concepts.  Such concepts  
denoted by words in indiv idual  languages are the 
basic units of language un iversa l  descr ipt ion.  In 
this view, words of individual languages are related 
to each other through the concepts, and translation 
of words f rom one language to another  is to be per-  
formed s t ra ight fo rward ly  through these concepts.

Fig.5 Terminological Words and Concepts 
In o rd inary  texts, even in abst racts  of sc ien-  
tific and technological papers which our MU systems 
aim to translate, however, we find a large number of 
ordinary words which lack such formal definitions and 
for which the above naive view of lexical translation 
does not work well. The concepts denoted by ordinary 
words  such as 'to introduce', 'to produce', 'advan- 
tages', 'fields' etc. do not have fo rmal  exp l i c i t  
definitions, even if we accept the existence of such 
denoted 'concepts'. Especial ly,  as \[Hobbs 1984\] 
noted, verbs are usua l ly  used to descr ibe quite 
different situations or events in the real world. He 
g ives  the fo l low ing  examples  of usages of 'to 
p roduce '  in med ica l  textbooks  on hepat i t i s  as 
follows. 
A disease can produce a condition 
A virus can produce a disease 
Something can produce a virus. 
Intesia flora can produce compounds 
etc. 
Note that, in Japanese, we have a verb 'tsukuri- 
dasu' wh ich  roughly cor responds  to 'to produce' in 
Engl ish, but some of the above usages of 'to pro-  
duce' wou ld  need  to be t rans la ted  into a d i f fe rent  
Japanese verb, 'hikiokosu'. In order to retain the 
simplicity of t rans lat ion through ext ra - l ingu is t i c  
concepts, we have to prepare  at least  two d i f fe rent  
concepts denoted by 'to produce' which are denoted in 
Japanese by 'tsukuridasu' and 'hikiokosu', respec-  
tively. Moreover, because we can easily recognize the 
d i f fe rences  among s i tuat ions  descr ibed  by 'to pro-  
duce' in the above sentences,  it is natura l  to 
imagine that there may be other languages which re- 
quire fur ther  d iv is ion of the concepts. The naive 
scheme in Fig. 4. may resu l t  in a p ro l i fe ra t ion  of 
concepts and cannot  exp la in  the cor respondence  of 
words in different languages. 
Hobb's answer  (and, of many other researchers  
both in NLU and linguistics) to this question, which 
is in tu i t i ve ly  reasonable ,  is: 'to produce' in the 
above examples is not a polysemy, because all of the 
660 
above usages share a certain core meaning in common 
such as 'x causes  y to come into existence'. This  
kind of approach, the lexical  decompos i t ion  ap- 
proach, not only  can prevent  the pro l i fe ra t ion  of 
concepts, but it also has another advantage in that 
it reduces the d ivers i ty  of surface express ions  by 
representing sentences with different surface verbs 
such as 'to produce', 'to create', 'to generate' etc. 
by the same combinations of primitives. Such a reduc- 
tion is pre ferab le  for 'know\]edge' based process ing  
wh ich  u t i l i zes  ext ra - l ingu is t i c  knowledge, i.e. set 
of rules intrinsic to external worlds, because the 
process ing is concerned with events  or s i tuat ions  
descr ibed  by texts but not d i rect ly  concerned  with 
texts themselves. 
Though such reduction is inevitable for certain 
kinds of knowledge  based process ing,  we have to 
notice that the lexical  decompos i t ion  approach, by 
itself, does not explain anything about lexical cor- 
respondence  among d i f ferent  languages. On the con- 
trary, it may increase  the d i f f i cu l t ies  of lexical  
choice in translat ion.  In order to d i sc r iminate  'to 
assass inate '  f rom 'to kill', 'to murder '  etc., 
though we have a rather direct correspondence between 
'to assass inate '  in Engl ish  and 'annsatsusuru' in 
Japanese, we have to encode many kinds of information 
other thal\] 'X cause Y to become not to be alive' such 
as Y's social status, the reason of 'killing' (polit- 
ical or not) and, in general,  the speaker's concep- 
tion of the 'killing' event in question. In other 
words, the description cannot replace surface lexical 
:items un less  a complete  set of (cognit ive or other) 
i_~etors relevant to surface lexical choices are fully 
specified. The fact that most decompositionists have 
been only concerned with verbs shows that to specify 
such a set of p r imi t ives  for express ing  even only 
the core mean ings  of nouns is far more di f f icult .  
(Note that 'field' shou ld  be t rans lated into six or 
more different nouns in Japanese \[Nagao \].986\]) Fur- 
thermore, because the factors to be cons idered  
re levant ,  or the features  of s i tuat ions  to be 
descr ibed that are cons idered  to be relevant, to 
surface lexical choices are highly dependent on each 
lexical  i tem (and so, of course, dependent  on each 
language), we cannot expect to have a complete set 
of factors which can be applied to choices of every 
lexical item of every individual language. Trying to 
get such a language independent set may result in a 
proliferation of factors instead of the proliferation 
of ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts found in the naive 
scheme. 
Again, note that we do not c la im that the 
aspect of understanding captured by decomposition is 
i r re levant  to translat ion.  Instead, it const i tu tes  
one of several  ind ispensab le  layers of descr ip t ion  
wh ich  fac i l i ta te  sys temat ic  compar i son  of the two 
languages. In order  to t rans late 'to assass inate '  
correctly into Japanese, we have to discriminate the 
literal meaning and metaphorical meanings of the 
word (such as 'to hurt someone's honor by a nasty 
tr ick or verba l  abuse'), because the Japanese  verb 
'annsatsusuru' may express the latter, the metaphor- 
ical meaning. Such discrimination obviously requires 
unders tand ing  of what  rea l ly  happened in the real  
world,  and the unders tand ing  at this level (contex- 
tual unders tand ing  level) should be expressed  by a 
descriptive framework using a certain set conceptual 
p r imi t ives  (because unders tand ing  resul ts  of this 
level should be represented independently from sur- 
face d ivers i f ied  texts). We only c la im that the 
descr ip t ion  only expresses certa in aspects of 
'meanings' of surface words and it cannot replace 
them. We also c la im that any a t tempts  to get a 
complete, language universal set of primitives for 
explaining lexical choices in any language will be 
in vain, and that what  we rea l ly  need at present  is 
much more comprehensive comparative studies on lexi- 
cal choices between languages in question in order to 
c lar i fy  what  k inds of factors are re levant  to the 
selection of appropriate target equivalents for each 
individual word of the source language. 
6 Implicit i\[nformation 
The discussion in the last section can be summa- 
rized thus; Because a continuously infinite physical- 
/menta l  wor ld  is descr ibed by a natura l  language 
wh ich  has only f inite words, words  in indiv idual  
languages are used to descr ibe  certa in  ranges o\[ 
events /ob jects .  That is, 'meanings' of words  a~:t 
quite vague. This vagueness  causes  d i f f i cu l t ies  of 
lexical  choice in t rans la t ion  by the fact  that cer- 
tain families of events/objects which can be des- 
cr ibed by the same words in one language should be 
descr ibed  by severa l  d i f fe rent  words in other 
languages (Fig. 6).

Fig.6 Vagueness of Word Meanings 
The same l ine of d i scuss ion  can be appl ied to 
l inguist ic  express ions  in general. That is, the set 
of (cognitive or other) factors which determine sur- 
face express ions  changes from one language to 
another. Or, even if s imi la r  factors work in the 
determinat ion  of sur face express ions,  they may be 
reflected by using quite different syntactic devices. 
It of ten happens that to determine  target surface 
express ions  requi res  a set of factors  wh ich  are not 
expressed at all in the source language or which are 
quite implicit, even if they are expressed. 
On the one hand, to t rans late  Japanese  to Eng- 
lish, for example, we have to have information about 
plural-singular and definiteness-indefin it en ess d is- 
t inct ions  of noun phrases which are imp l i c i t  in 
Japanese. 
The Japanese sentence 
'watashi-ha kino kangofu-ni  atta.' 
\[I\] \[yesterday\] \[nurse\] \[to meet\] 
\[past\] 
may correspond to the fo l low ing  four sentences  in 
English, depending on the context. 
'I met a nurse 
the nurse 
nurses 
the nurses 
yesterday' 
Because Japanese  nat ive speakers do not feel  
explicitly the above sentence lacks information, we 
can c la im that  the sentence  is just  vague  as 
'meanings' of words  are. That  is, the sentence can 
describe a set of situations in the real world which 
share certain properties in common, but in English, 
the same set of s i tuat ions should be expressed  
d i f ferent ly ,  depend ing  on proper t ies  of s i tuat ions  
wh ich  are not re levant  to the se lec t ion  of Japanese  
expressions and which therefore remain implicit in 
Japanese. 
On the other hand, Japanese is rich Jn honorific 
expressions and highly dependent on speaker-h~arer's 
social re lat ionships.  Therefore, in the translation 
from Engl i sh  to Japanese, we have to recover  such 
in fo rmat ion  which is impl ic i t  in English. For 
example, a simple sentence such as 
'I'll come tomorrow' 
may correspond to Japanese sentences such as 
'asu oukagai /tashimasu' 
\[the hearer is blgher in the social position\] 
'asu oukaigai shimasu' 
\[the hearer is higher in the social position\] 
\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\] 
'asu ikuyo' 
\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\] 
\[the speaker is male\] 
'asu ikuwa' 
\[the speaker is intimate with the hearer\] 
\[the speaker is female\] 
'asu ik imasu' 
\[neutral\] 
Eng l i sh  nat ive  speakers  certainly do not think 
that the sentence is ambiguous in the above sense. In 
this case, Japanese requires information about social 
status of speakers and hearers, wh ich  is not so 
relevant to the selection of English expressions. 
Speaker's intentions, which recent researches of 
NLU \ [Brady  1983\]  \ [Appe l t  1985\]  \ [Grosz  1986\] ,  
espec ia l ly  in d ia logue systems, p lace a st rong 
emphas is  upon, are a typical  example  of imp l i c i t  
in format ion ,  and we can easi ly imag ine  s i tuat ions  
where it also plays an important role in translation, 
espec ia l ly  in t rans la t ion  of d ia logues  such as the 
simultaneous translation of telephone communication. 
It is, however, not desi'rable for translation systems 
to translate sentences according to speaker's inten- 
tion alone. T rans la t ing  'It's hot in this  room' to 
'mado-o akete kudasai' (Please open the window) pro- 
bably commits too much as a translation system. The 
system should select natural  express ions  in target  
languages  as long as they  do not  d i s to r t  the 
'meanings' of source sentences too much. This implies 
that 'understanding of sentences' and 'the mean ings  
of sentences' should be distinguished. What is meant 
by 'unders tand ing  of sentences '  is, as recent  
researches in NLU typically show, to understand the 
situations where certain utterances are given or the 
s i tuat ions which texts descr ibe,  inc lud ing such 
factors as speaker's intent ions,  speaker -heater ' s  
social relationships, definiteness/indefiniteness of 
re ferenced objects, etc. Though these factors  are 
re levant  to the se lect ion  of target  express ions,  it 
is doubt fu l  that all such der ived in fo rmat ion  is a 
part of the descr ip t ion  of source sentences  wh ich  
expresses  var ious factors determin ing  the surface 
661 
expressions in the source language. Researchers in 
NLU often confuse unders tand ing  resul ts  w i th  the 
description of input sentences. 
As noted before,  the researches  in NLU so far 
have revealed that 'understanding sentences' cannot 
be def ined, at least  computat iona l ly ,  w i thout  
considering certain specific internal tasks, and the 
task of MT, 'to re -express  in target  languages the 
information conveyed by sentences of source languages 
wi th  as least d i s to r t ion  as possible', by itself, 
does not de f ine  anyth ing about what  k inds of under -  
s tanding are requ i red  in MT. Because the factors 
relevant to the determination of surface structures 
are dependent  on each language, the exact requ i re -  
ments on what aspects of the situations described by 
source texts should be 'understood' cannot be f ixed 
unless the language to wh ich  the texts are to he 
translated is specified. 
Eng l i sh  nat ive  speakers,  for example,  can 'un- 
derstand' 
'I'll come tommorrow' 
without any attention to the social relationships of 
the speaker and the hearer. Only when they are asked 
to t rans late  the sentence into Japanese, must  they 
consciously consider such factors to select the most 
appropr iate  Japanese  expression.  The same line of 
d iscuss ion can be app l ied  to the prob lem of target  
word selection. We cannnot enumerate, by monolingual 
thinking, d i f fe rent  'concepts' denoted  by the verb 
'to produce'. Only when we are asked to t rans late  
sentences containing the verb into another language, 
can we try to f ind  appropr ia te  target words. Dur ing  
this process, 'understanding of the sentences' and so 
'understanding of the s i tuat ions  descr ibed  by the 
verb' are promoted  in such a d i rec t ion  that we can 
identify the most appropriate target verbs. 
The above d iscuss ion  impl ies  that  certa in  'un- 
derstanding processes' are target language dependent, 
and cannot  be ful ly spec i f ied  in a mono- l ingua l  
manner.  We have to separate, at least conceptual ly ,  
bi-lingual processings from mono-lingual processings 
which extract explicitly a set of factors deter- 
mining the surface structures of source texts. In the 
tentat ive  f ramework  in Sect ion  2, the role of the 
transfer  phase was  rest r ic ted to comput ing  factors 
for determin ing  target s t ructures  f rom factors ex- 
t racted f rom source texts inc lud ing their  sur face 
structures.  We assumed there that a set of factors 
for determin ing  target sur face structures could be 
computed  f rom those ext racted dur ing the ana lys is  
phase, though the computation itself was dependent on 
language pairs. The discussion in this section shows 
that this assumption is not true. The transfer phase 
should do more  than that. The rev ised f ramework  is 
shown in Fig. 7. Though we adopt here the conven-  
tional division of phases in current transfer based 
systems, we do not claim that the three phase confi- 
gurat ion is the best and that these three phases 
should be executed in order. Instead, we can think of 
a system in which the 'understanding' phase extracts 
not only factors determing surface source texts but 
also factors for determining target structures. But 
even so, we c la im that the unders tand ing  resu l ts  in 
such a system have to be specific to language pairs 
and not language universal .  Which configuration is 
superior to the other, the two phase configuration or 
the three phase conf igurat ion,  should be disscused

7 Layers of Understanding - Knowledge and Translation 
The fact that 'understanding texts' has been 
understood d i f fe rent ly  by d i f fe rent  researchers  in 
NLU impl ies  that the 'knowledge' to wh ich  text  con- 
tents are to be related is different from one system 
to another. So far, quite different sorts of informa- 
tion prepared beforehand in systems have been called 
'knowledge'. In Section 5, we discussed two different 
approaches to meanings of words which may lead us to 
quite different views of what 'knowledge' is: One is 
to relate mean ings  of words to extra- l ingu is t ic ,  
language independent concepts whose semantics are, in 
turn, given by certain theories (or formal systems), 
internal processing for specific tasks such as data 
base accesses, problem solving, etc. The other is to 
describe core meanings of words by relating the words 
to a certa in set of pr imit ives.  The latter may be 
augmented by adding further description using cogni- 
tive, s i tuat iona l  or other features (as noted in 
Sect ion 6, some of these may be language dependent) 
in order to specify what families of objects/events 
the words can descr ibe.  The knowledge descr ibed  by 
this approach is essentially knowledge about possible 
usages of words  and can be ut i l i zed  to t rans late 
words of certain types or to make general inferences 
on the s i tuat ions  described. On the other hand, 
'knowledge' which is often mentioned in fields such 
as knowledge engineering, expert systems and so forth 
refers to knowledge of specific fields, and is more 
easi ly expressed  in the f irst approach. These two 
approaches are quite opposite. While the decomposi- 
tion approach tries to discover a single description 
which covers possible usages of a word including its 
metaphor ica l  usages (the decompos i t iona l i s ts  may 
c la im all usages are metaphor ical ) ,  the ext ra - l in -  
guist ic  concept  approach (the concept  approach,  in 
short) tries to enumerate a set of concepts denoted 
by the word. Whi le  the decompos i t ion  approach 
attempts to find internal structures of single words, 
the concept approach tends to identify even complex 
express ions  such as 'diagrams on the plane of the 
ce lest ia l  equator' (note that this express ion  has a 
s imple t rans lat ion  equ iva lent  in Japanese l ike 
'jizuhyou') as s ing le  concepts. AS noted in Sect ion 
5, the concept  approach ,  wh ich  we there  ca l led  the 
'naive approach', cannot be used to express the whole 
meaning of texts, but this does not imply that know- 
\].edge expressed by this approach is i rrelevant in MT. 
On the cont rary ,  it o f ten  happens  that we rea l i ze  
'lack of knowledge '  in sys tems,  when we f ind  re\]s- 
translat ions of terminologica l  words or when we find 
misunderstandings  of source texts. 
Because  the decompos  it ion approach essent ia l ly  
captures possible usages of words, it cannot decide 
appropr ia te  t rans la t ions  of te rmino log ica l  expres- 
s ions  by i tsel f .  Th is  is obv ious  because  even human 
t rans la tors  who  have enough knowledge  of language 
usages often mis t rans la te  terminological  words. The 
sys tems or human t rans la tors  should  have knowledge 
about relat ionships between words and extra- l inguis-  
t ic concepts  in the sub jec t  f ie lds.  Because  such  
relatiorlships are a kind of conventions specif ic to 
each sub jec t  f ie ld,  we s imp ly  have to know these  
conventions. Several current MT systems prepare cer- 
tain f rameworks  for treat ing such conventions of term 
t rans la t ions  spec i f i c  to ind iv idua l  sub jec t  field~: 
such as the f ie ld  code in the MU sys tems \ [Sakamoto  
\]984\],  the mic ro -g lossar ies  in PAHO's  sys tems 
\ [Vasconce l los  1985\] ,  h ie rarch ica l  organizat ions of 
d ic t ionar ies  in GETA's sys tems \ [Bo i tet  1982\] ,  etc. 
However ,  though re la t ing  terminological  expressions 
(or words)  in d i f fe rent  languages  through ext ra -  
linguistic, language universal  concepts has become a 
standard way  of thinking in the field of terminology 
and already adopted by several mult i - l ingual  termino-  
logy data  banks  (for example ,  \ [Goetscha lckx  1974\]), 
they do not expl ic i t ly  introduce the extra- l inguist ic  
concepts  in the i r  f rameworks  but  instead,  re la te  
rather direct ly the terminological  words or expres- 
sions of the di f ferent languages. 
(Uchida 1985\] c la ims that we have to introduce 
ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts  even in MT sys tems,  be-  
cause ; 
(1) fu turn  MT sys tems shou ld  inc lude  not: on ly  
knowledge  of the cor respondence  of te rmino log ica l  
expressions but also factual knowledge and knowledge 
about inference rules specif ic to the fields, etc. 
(2) Such extra- l inguist ic  knowledge is language uni- 
versal, and, there fore ,  sbou\ ]d  be managed by  d i f -  
ferent f rameworks  from genera\], l inguist ic knowledge 
which  is l~mguage dependent. 
\[Boitet 1984\] shows how factual knowledge in a 
spec i f i c  sub jec t  f ie ld  can be u t i l i zed  to reso lve  
cer ta in  syntact i c  ambigu i t ies  such  as those  of the 
scope of coordinations, determinat ion of antecedents 
of relat J  w~ c lauses  and pronouns ,  etc. For  example ,  
he discusses that determin ing the correct scopes of 
the coordinat ions 
(i) dangerous \[cyanide and chlorine\] fumes 
(2) \[carbon and nitrogen tetraoxyde\] 
requires fatual knowledge of a specif ic level such as 
(3) cyanide fumes are dangerous 
(4) there  is no carbon  te t raoxyde  in normal  
chemistry. 
The sequences  of 'cyanide and ch lo r ine  fumes '  and 
'carbon an(\[ n i t rogen  te t raoxyde '  cou ld  not be d i f -  
ferentiated, if we used only a rough semant ic  classi-  
f i ca t ion  of nouns  such as be ing  the name of a 
chemica l  etc. (These examples ,  as Bo i te t  notes,  
cannot be correct ly interpreted by a s imple method  of 
p re ference  semant ics . )  The necess i ty  of deta i led  
fac tua l  knowledge  such as (3) and (4) is obv ious ,  
and, because such knowledge in chemist ry  is language 
independent, it should be represented in a language 
un iversa l  manner .  Ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts should 
play more important  roles than mere links among the 
terminological  terms of individual languages. 
However, a l though we complete ly  agree that extra- 
l inguist ic knowledge should play more important  roles 
in future high qual i ty translat ion systems, we have 
to be very care fu l  ill the in t roduct ion  of such  
knowledge  into MT sys tems.  F i r s t  of all, as we have  
repeated ly  c la imed,  the 'meanings '  ex t rac ted  f rom 
sentences  that can be re la ted  to knowledge  of th is  
kind does not at all exhaust the informat ion con- 
veyed  by  sentences  that  need to be ' t ransfer red '  
into target sentences. Moreover, because sentences 
even in specif ic subject f ields consist of both ter- 
mino log ica l  te rms  and ord inary  words ,  we cannot  
expect to express a\]I the results of understanding 
such sentences at the \]eve\]. of descr ipt ion using only 
the extra- l inguist ic  concepts. We can only expect to 
express the understanding results of certain parts 
of sentences  at th is  level and check  whether  the 
understanding results of those parts are compat ib le  
wi th common sense knowledge of the specif ic field. In 
ozher words, the process ing at this level cannot play 
the main  ro le  ~n t rans la t ion  but  can on ly  p lay  some 
roles to prevent certain kinds of 'misunderstanding'. 
\[Boitet 1984\] notes this point as 'grafting on expert 
systems ' . 
In addit ion to this, the boundary between ter- 
mino log ica l  terms and ordinary words is not so clear. 
When we res t r i c t  te rmino log ica l  te rms  to names  of 
chemical  compounds, of mechanical  parts, etc., Ld\]e 
problem of the boundary might  not appear so serious 
:but such restr ict ion <:'an lead to serious l imita- 
t ion on the ava i lab i l i ty  of knowledge  of  th i s  k ind  
for forming selectina\] restr ict ions necessary for the 
d isambiguat ion of source sentences. If we at temp to 
extend  the range  of ' te rmino log ica l  terms' ,  the 
problem of the boundary between terminologica l  terms 
and ordinary words arises. For example, \[Hobbs 1984\] 
points out that, in a textbook on hepatitis, ordinary 
words  such  as 'human', 'animal ' ,  'water', 'alcohol '  
etc. have specia l ized meanings di f ferent f rom those 
in general  f ields;the concept denoted by 'human', in 
this f ie ld,  is not a lower  concept  of the concept  
denoted by 'animal'. We might then claim that these 
two terms are terminologica l  terms of the f ield and 
that the denoted  concepts  have cer ta in  res t r i c ted  
relat ionships with the other concepts in the fields. 
A\] though such  se leet iona l  res t r i c t ions  
specia l ized in certain subject fields might  be very 
useful for resolv ing syntactic ambigu i t ies  of sourse 
sentences ,  p rob lems here are how to f ind such 
restr icted usages of ordinary words  that are specif ic 
to certain fields, how to clar i fy the possible rela- 
t ionsh ips  anlong 'concepts'  in those  f ie lds  ( to 
c reate  semant ic  mode ls  of the f ie lds) ,  etc. As the 
above  example  shows ,  even c la r i fy ing  the h ie rarchy  
among concepts ,  wh ich  is one of the preva i l ing  
techn iques  for o rgan iz ing  'knowledge '  in o rd inary  
knowledge  representat ion  research ,  is not so easy  
when we have  to deal  w i th  reasonab ly  la rge  sub jec t  
fields. In order to uti l ize knowledge of this sort 
in the d lsambiguat ion pFocess, we have to encode not 
only  such h ie rarch ica l  relat ionships among concepts 
but also many other kinds of factual knowledge about 
663 
those  concepts .  Be fore  c la iming  ' such-and-such  
fac tua l  knowledge  can reso lve  cer ta in  spec i f i c  
ambigui t ies  of given sentences', we have to develop 
methodo log ies  by which  we can systemat ica l ly  clarify 
a set of concepts  in the g iven  f ie lds  and the 
re la t ionsh ips  among those  concepts ,  and can gather  
factual knowledge relevant to those concepts. 
The above  d i scuss ion  shows  that there  is not  a 
c lear  boundary  between te rmino log ica l  words  and 
ord inary  words ;  but  ins tead,  there  is a cont inuous  
distr ibut ion of words  f rom pure terminologica l  words, 
such as names  of  chemica l  compounds ,  at the one 
ext reme to pure  o rd inary  words  at the other.  Though 
the pure termino log ica l  words have their own language 
universal  def in i t ions and can be related direct ly to 
ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts ,  the ord inary  words  have  
only their usages in individual languages and we have 
to in fe r  the denoted  'concepts '  f rom the i r  usages.  
That is, as noted  before ,  the denoted  'concepts '  of  
o rd inary  words  are language in terna l  and cannot  be 
re la ted  d i rec t ly  to ext ra - l ingu is t i c  concepts .  The 
-select ional restr ict ions wh ich  ord inary  words  have, 
there fore ,  can on ly  be captured  by spec i fy ing  what  
events/objects can be descr ibed by those words, and 
that speci f icat ion might  be language dependent. 
Some of the di f f icul t ies in MT are caused by the 
fact that most  of the words  in cer ta in  sub jec t  
fields, even words  which are usually taken as part of 
the termino logy of those fields, are in-between the 
two extremes, and sentences usual ly contain words  at 
various posi t ions in the distribution. For example, a 
sentence such as 
(5) The mix ture  g ives  of f  dangerous  cyan ide  and 
chlorine fumes 
conta ins  two  pure  te rmino log ica l  words  (i.e., 
cyan ide ,  ch lo r ine) ,  two  ord inary  words  (i.e., 'to 
give', 'to be dangerous') and two intermediate types 
of words  (i.e. 'fume', 'mixture').  Th is  fac t  requ i res  
us to p repare  var ious  sor ts  of descr ip t ion  for the 
se lec t iona l  res t r i c t ions  among words  (for the  
analysis phase) and also for the select ion of target 
equivalent  words (for the transfer phase). As selec- 
t ina l  res t r i c t ions  for d i sambiguat ion ,  we have to 
have fac tua l  knowledge  of the f ie lds  (for res t r i c -  
t ions  among termino log ica l  words) ,  res t r i c t ions  
spec i f ied  by  us ing  cogn i t ive ,  s i tuat iona l  or o ther  
features  (for res t r i c t ions  among ord inary  words  --  
deep case f rames w i th  semant ic  restr ict ions on case 
fillers, which are speci f ied in the verb dictionary, 
are one of the typical  techniques found in current MT 
sys tems)  and  var ied  sor ts  of mix tures  of these  two  
ext remes .  On the o ther  hand,  for the se lec t ion  of 
appropr ia te  ta rget  word  se lec t ion ,  we have  to have  
several kinds of 'transfer' mechan ism using di f ferent 
sor ts  of in fo rmat ion  such  as ext ra - l ingu is t i c  
concepts  wh ich  l ink  the words  of ind iv idua l  lan-  
guages, d is t inguish ing features for descr ibed events- 
/objects, and so on. 
The s i tuat ion becomes even more compl icated due 
to the fact that a single word has often both specia- 
l ized usages and general usages, even if we restr ict  
our domain  of t ranslat ion to certain l imited areas. 
The  f rameworks  wh ich  cur rent  MT sys tems 
prov ide ,  such  as semant ic  features ,  sub jec t  f ie \ ]d  
codes,  mic ro -g lossar ies  spec i f i c  to the f ie lds,  
h ierarchica l ly  o rgan ized  d ic t ionar ies ,  etc., cannot  
664 
- capture  the  in terw ined  re la t ionsh ips  between 
ordinary words and terminologica l  words, and between 
usage s specia l ized in fields and general  usages. 
We have to emphas ize  that there  is no s ing le  
layer  of 'unders tand ing '  exc lus ive ly  re levant  to 
translation; only mutua l ly  related layers of under- 
s tand ing  rang ing  f rom deta i led  unders tand ing  (re- 
la ted  to fac tua l  knowledge  in the f ield) to the 
vague  and genera l  unders tand ing  of s i tuat ions .  Al l  
these layers wi l l  need to contr ibute to high qual i ty 
translat ion in the future. 
8 Problems in the Future 
8o far ,  we have  d i scussed  what  makes  MT 
researches  d i f fe rent  f rom other  f rameworks  in NLU, 
and we have  s t ressed  that one of the pecu l ia r i t ies  
of MT as an NLP app l i ca t ion  is that  we cannot  
readily set up a part icular  task-or iented level of 
'unders tand ing '  in MT as we can in o ther  app l i ca -  
t ions .  Th is  pecu l ia r i ty  causes  some d i f f i cu l t  
prob lems not encountered elsewhere, and we wi\] 1 list 
some of them since their resolut ions seem part iculary 
impor tant  in future ,  h igh  qua l i ty  t rans la t ion  
systems. 
\ [P rob lem i\] (Mu l t i - Layer  Representation) The process 
of mach ine translat ion can be taken as a sequence of 
processes of the extract ion of vario~is factors wh ich  
col lect ively determine the sur face  syntact i c  s t ruc -  
tures of source sentences, the computat ion  of factors 
which are relevant to target sentence structures, and 
the rea l i za t ion  of those  fac tors  as sur face  s t ruc -  
tures  in the ta rget  language.  There fore ,  we need a 
certain descr ipt ive f ramework  in which we can express 
these various sorts of factors and from wh ich  we can 
re t r ieve  such factors.  Annotated  t ree  s t ruc tures  
such as those  used  in the MU sys tems,  GETA, METAL  
etc. are one of such currently avai lable frameworks.  
Annotated  t rees  as they  are, however ,  have  on ly  
s ing le  s t ruc tures  (trees) of nodes  w i th  var ious  
sor ts  of in fo rmat ion  descr ibed  in the annotat ion  
parts. It is obv ious  that each d i f fe rent  sor t  of 
in fo rmat ion  requ i res  d i f fe rent  geometor ica l  struc- 
tures so that the current annotated trees may not be 
su f f i c ient  for soph is t i ca ted  process ing required in 
the fu ture  MT systems.  Though Kay's notat ion  in 
un i f i ca t ion  grammar  \[Kay 1984\] is obv iuos ly  one of 
the candidate frameworks, it is appropr iate only for 
descr ibing interpretat ions which  have already deter-  
mined by the analysis phase. Ef fect ive computat ional  
f rameworks  shoud be deve loped  for p roduc ing  such  
descr ip t ions  f rom source  sentences  wh ich  might  be 
qu i te  ambiguous .  Texhn iques  for shar ing  a par t ia l  
descr ipt ion at a certain level by several di f ferent 
descr ipt ions at d i f ferent levels and for mainta in ing  
the consistency of descr ipt ion when some parts of it 
are changed should be developed. 
\[Problem 2\] (Integration of  Unders tand ing  Levels)  As 
d i scussed  in Sect ion  7, we  shou ld  be ab le  to 
integrate several d i f ferent levels of 'understanding' 
w i th  l ingu is t i c  leve ls  of descr ip t ion .  The  
descr ipt ive f rameworks  developed so far have confined 
themse lves  to e i ther  l ingu is t i c  leve ls  or to one of 
the specif ic understanding levels. Kay's uni f icat ion 
grammar ,  LFG, GPSG etc. are al l  concerned  w i th  the 
descr ip t ion  of  l ingu is t i c  levels.  A l l  o f  them, for 
example, treat surface words as pr imi t ive  units. On 
the other hand, most researches in NLU aim to relate 
texts to certain extra- l inguist ic  knowledge so that 
the final understanding results are expressed inde- 
pendent ly from their l inguist ic source structures. In 
o rder  to in tegrate  unders tand ing  resu l t s  w i th  the 
translat ion proccess, we need further researches to 
c la r i fy  not  only  what  leve ls  of unders tand ing  are 
real ly re\].evant to translat ion but also how we are to 
coord inate  such  d ivers i f ied  leve ls  of  p rocess ing  
computat iona I ly. 
\[Problem 3\] ( Incompleteness of Texts and 'Knowledge ' -  
Robustness  of P rocess ing)  IIuman t rans la tors  can 
translate 'I'll come tomorrow' into Japanese without: 
any knowledge about the social re lat ionships of the 
speaker  and the hearer .  They w i l l  t rans la te  the 
sentence  based  on the de fau l t  assumpt ion  that the 
re la t ionsh ip  is neutra l .  It usua l ly  happens  that, 
even for human translators, certain factors relevant 
to the detc~rmination of target structures cannot be 
obtained because of the incompleteness of texts and 
lack of necessary  knowledge .  The sys tem shou ld  be 
able to determine  the most  feas ib le  t rans la t ions  
based on the incomplete factors extracted f rom soui-ce 
texts. Though es tab l i sh ing  sets  of fac tors  w~ich  
col lect iw~ly determine the surface structures of the 
source and target languages may faci l i tate systemat ic  
cont ras t ive  s tud ies  of the two  languages  and make 
present  ad -hoc  t rans fer  phase  c leaner ,  we have  to 
note that actual systems cannot a\].ways extract such 
fac tors  f rom the source  texts.  Even in fu ture  
sys tems,  we wi l l  have  to prepare  heur i s t i c  gu ided  
transfer procedures based on lower  leve l  factors ,  
such as syntact i c  s t ruc tures ,  a lone.  That  is, the 
idea of 'safety nets' is ind ispensab\ ]  e, however  
intel l igent the future MT system might be. \[Nishida 
\].982\] disscusses, in their MT system from Engl ish to 
Japanese ,  some techn iques  for ca lcu la t ing  sur face  
syntact ic structures of Japanese which  can preserve 
the d i scourse  fac tors  of Eng l i sh  texts,  w i thout  
referr ing to such factors explicit ly. These rules are 
a kind of heur ist ic  but are not l inguist ical ly  we l l -  
founded. For this kind of processing, we may have to 
introduce other kinds of knowledge, for example, the 
expert knowledge of profess ional  translators \[Tucker 
1985 \] . 
\ [P rob lem 41 (Easy Accomodat ion  of Future Deve lopment  
of Theories) As noted in Section 3, we cannot expect 
to have a complete set of factors wh ich  carl uniquely 
determine  the sur face  syntact i c  s t ruc tures  of a 
language. Becauese there is always poss ib i l i ty  that 
future l inguist ic  research will reveal factors which 
have not yet been noticed, the computat ional  frame- 
work  shou ld  be f lex ib le  enough for accomodat ing  
these  fac tors .  In th i s  sense,  to commit  s t rong ly  to 
one l ingu is t i c  theory  at p resent  seems dangerous  
for computat iona l  f rameworks .  Fur thermore ,  though 
most  l inguist ic theories aim to descr ibe l inguist ic 
s t ruc tures  f rom a mono- l ingua l  po in t  of v iew,  the 
factors to be extracted from source texts depends on 
the target language. Some of the factors relevant to 
t ranslat ion can only be clar i f ied through bi-\].ingual, 
cont ras t ive  s tud ies  of the two languages  and by 
referr ing to the aspects of 'understanding' which are 
obv ious ly  beyond the scope of cur rent  l ingu is t i c  
theor ies .  We \]lave to note that  the computat iona l  
f rameworks  for mach ine translat ion should be f lexible 
enough for treat ing various sorts of phenomena which 
current l inguist ic theories do not cover. 
\ [P rob lem 5\] (Other Factors  to be Accomodated  - 
D iscourse  Factors ,  Cogn i t ive  Factors )  The computa -  
tional researches in discourse analysis so far have 
put  emphas is  on a cer ta in  set of top ics ,  such as 
reso lu t ions  of anaphor ic  express ions ,  recover ing  
speakers '  in tent ion  f rom ut terances ,  etc. A l though 
these  are more  or less re levant  to high qua l i ty  
t rans la t ion  in the future, we have to a t tack  much 
w ider  ranges  of p rb \ ]ems concerned  w i th  d i scouse  
phenomena, that is, what kinds of discourse factors 
are relevant to the determinat ion of surface sentence 
s ty les  and in what  manner.  Though re levant  top ics  
have been treated in text l inguist ics and many useful 
ideas have been proposed already, many of them seem 
to be too vague  to formalJ, ze computat iona l ly .  It is 
t ime to fin(\] computatJorlal formal izat ion for them 
and to integrate them wi th  translat ion processes. MT 
is one of the most  promis ing  appl icat ion fields where 
the research  resu l t s  in text l ingu is t i cs  cou ld  be 
util ized. 
\[ Ishiwata 1985\] discusses how cognit ive features 
are relevant to translation, especial ly word transla- 
tion. By tak ing the F rench  verb  'tomber'  and the 
Japanese  t rans la t ion  equ iva lents  ' taoreru '  and  
'ochJru' as a typical example, he shows that certain 
movements  or ob jec ts  wh ich  carl be expressed  by the 
verb ' tomber'  in F rench  shou ld  be descr ibed  d i f -  
fe rent ly  by us ing  e i ther  'taoreru' or 'ochiru'. His 
claim \]s that such select ion of target word depends 
on how the speaker  recogn ize  the movements  of 
ob jects ,  that  is, whether  the mot ion  J s ra ther  
perpend icu la r  (i.e. the s tone  fa\] is) or not  (i.e. the 
man fell over). That is, the select ion of appropr iate 
Japaneses  verbs  depend on a cer ta in  k ind of 'image' 
\]eve\] unders tand ing  of the event  whJ ch the F rench  
verb describes. Whether such levels of understanding 
carl be represented  in a symbol  ic manner ,  and what  
kinds of such symbol ic  cognit ive features are neces- 
sary, whether  there  is a set of cogn i t ive  features  
which is effect ive for any language pair, and so on 
are, of course,  research  top ics  in the d i s tant  
future. However,  we }lave to note that such cognit ive 
levels  of features  are more  use fu l  than  ext ra - l in -  
guistic know\].edge in specif ic subject fields, for 
the cho ice  of appropr ia te  ta rget  equ iva lents  for 
words with wide usages. 
\ [P rob lem 6\] (Set t ing  Layers  of 'Understand ing ' )  As 
d i scussed  in Sect ion  6 and 7, we can d i s t ingu ish  at 
least  the two ext reme layers  of unders tand ing  and 
knowledge relevant to MT. Whether these two kinds of 
unders tand ing  and knowledge  can be represented  Jn 
s ing le  f rameworks ,  \]low they  shou ld  be coord inated  
w i th  l ingu is t i c  p rocess ing  (analys is ,  t ransfer ,  
generat ion)  computat iona\ ] \ ] .y ,  to what  extent  these 
kinds of knowledge can real ly be encoded in systems, 
etc. have to be c lar i f ied .  If tho two  k inds  of 
knowledge should be represented separately, we have 
to clarify hew many dif ferent layers exists and \]low 
they should be mutual ly  related. 
We have l isted above some of the prob lems caused 
by the pecul iar i ty  of MT that we cannot determine in 
advance a certain concrete level of 'understanding'. 
The other pecul iar i t ies of MT come from the fact that 
MT sys tems have to t reat  documents  of much  w ider  
sub jec t  f ie lds  and of much  more  var ied  text types 
than o ther  app l i ca t ions .  Our Mu sys tems,  for 
example, restr ict  the document  type to abstracts of 
sc ient i f i c  and  techno log ica l  papers  but t reat  
sc ient i f i c  f ie lds  in genera\].. The PAHO's sys tems 
t rans la te  documents  in more  res t r i c ted  f ie lds  but 
include very wide ranges of document  types, including 
conference  repor ts ,  budget  p roposa ls ,  l e t te rs  etc. 
665 
This fact, in combinat ion  with the d i f f i cu l ty  of 
se t t ing  the unders tand ing  leve l ,  causes  many 
practical diff iculties. 
\[Problem 7\] (Complexities of Semantic Models) Wider 
subject fields imply more complex i t ies  in semant ic  
models.  In data base access, one only  has to deal  
w i th  a s imp le  set of semant ic  c lasses such as 'name 
of companies' ,  'person's name', 'salary', etc. and 
their  poss ib le semant ic  re lat ionships.  However ,  as 
\[Bennet 1985\] notes 
'the thought of writing complex models of even one 
complete technical domain is staggering: one set of 
manuals we have worked with --- is part of a document 
collection that is expected to comprise some i00,000 
pages. A typical NLP research group would not even be 
able to read that  vo lume of manual ,  much less wr i te  
the necessary  semant ic  models, in any reasonab le  
amount of time', 
we have to treat much more complex semantic fields in 
MT. We have to deve lop  methodo log ies  to c lar i fy  the 
structures of such complex semantic models systemati- 
cally for any given subject field. 
\ [Problem 8\] ( Instabi l i ty  of Lexica l  Coding) w ider  
subject  f ie lds  imply  a large amount  of vocabulary,  
and high quality translation requires rich informa- 
tion to be coded for each lexical  item. This  means  
that we need many lexicographers for lexical coding, 
and the problem of consistency arises. High semantic 
complexities imply that criteria for lexical coding 
are not so evident.  In the MU project,  we prepared  
rather detailed manuals for lexical coding but they 
are still not sufficient for obtaining good quality 
codings. The semant ic  codes, for example,  are often 
dependent  on indiv idual  lex icographers  and such 
incons is tency  caused  many troubles in g rammar  
development and also depressing translation errors. 
The prob lem of ins tab i l i ty  is not found not only in 
semantic coding but also in every other description 
items in the dictinary, when codings are perforlaed by 
many people. We have to deve lop not only f lex ib le  
sof tware tools for fac i l i ta t ing  lexical  coding and 
cons is tency chek ing \[ Kogure 1984\] \[Boitet 1982 \] but 
also effective linguistic checking procedures. 
\ [Problem 9\] (Weak Semant ic  Constra ints)  The lack of 
concrete in terna l  p rocess ing  for specif ic  tasks 
implies that the system cannot reject nonsense inter- 
pretations of input sentences. In other applications, 
certain syntactic interpretations are judged as non- 
sense when the internal processing cannot give any 
meaningful semantics to them. Furthermore, as Hobbs 
noted by the examples  of 'to produce', w ide subject  
f ields imply  that var ious  usages of words  wh ich  
share a core mean ing  in common wi l l  appear  in 
texts. That is, many usages which have metaphorical 
flavors ('The car drinks gas' is a well-known example 
given by \[Wilks 1972\]) wi l l  commonly appear in texts 
and make the rejection of syntactic interpretations 
on semant ic  grounds harder. In the MU systems,  we 
prepared about 50 semantic categories for nouns, but 
most of them are not as effective as we had expected 
for p revent ing  'nonsense' interpretat ions,  though 
they are e f fect ive  for certa in kinds of semant ic  
in terpreta t ion  (for example,  for deep case inter-  
\]gretations of p repos i t iona l  phrases  wh ich  are not 
::strictly governed by their  predicates)  and target  
word selection to some extent. AS noted in Section 7, 
though Wilks' idea of 'preferent ia l  semant ics '  is 
666 
one of the possible solutions, we have to coordinate 
this idea with the other kinds of processing and wi%n 
preferences of other levels. 
\ [Problem I0\] (Ma inta inab i l i ty  of Systems) In the 
d iscuss ion  of \ [Problem 3\] , we c la imed that the 
t ransfer  component  shou ld  be robust  and be able to 
compute the most feasible factors relevant to target 
s t ructure  determinat ion ,  even if necessary  factors 
cannot be given by the analysis phase. The same line 
of discussion can be applied to the entire process of 
MT. The analys is  phase, for example,  cannot expect  
that a ful l  set of necessary  in fo rmat ion  for inter-  
p re ta t ion  of input sentences wi l l  a lways  be acces-  
sible. This imp l ies  that, at each phase of t rans la -  
tion, a certain number of rules, which are a kind of 
heuristics and not theoretically well-founded, should 
be prepared. Furthermore, to deal with wide subject 
fields implies that we have to treat varied types of 
l inguist ic  phenomena,  which again requ i res  a large 
number  of rules in those systems.  Wider  f ields a lso 
increase ambiguities at each level of intepretation. 
A single word may have several  d i f fe rent  par t -o f -  
speech interpretat ions ,  to each of wh ich  several  
d i f fe rent  syntact ic  features may be assg ined (for 
example, a verb often have several different surface 
case patterns).  This d i f f i cu l ty  can be avo ided  to 
some extent in other applications because we can fix 
certa in levels  of in terpreta t ion  in advance (for 
example,  'ship' may only be used as a noun in a 
certain data base access system, though it has a verb 
interpretat ion).  In order to prevent  the pro l i fe ra -  
tion of possible syntactic interpretation in MT, we 
need a certain number of disambiguation rules which 
are also heuristic based \[Tsujii 1984\]. In short, we 
have to manage a large number of rules whose mutual 
re la t ionsh ips  are t ighter  than those found in most  
other rule based expert  systems. We have to deve lop 
not only flexible software systems for managing such 
large rule based sys tems \[Johnson 1984\] \ [Nakamura 
1986\]  but  a l so  methodo log ies  by wh ich  we can 
systematically organize and integrate  knowledge  of 
quite different sorts. 
9 Conclusions 
In this paper, we have concentrated on problems 
concerned  wi th  'understanding and t rans lat ion '  and 
have tr ied to c lar i fy  that the aspects  of 'under- 
standing' relevant to MT are different from those in 
convent iona l  NLU researches  and their  app l i ca t ion  
fields. The relation~ships between linguistic expres- 
sions and their unders tand ing  resul ts  are not as 
s t ra ight fo rward  as most  researchers  in NLU have 
assumed. Though most researches in NLU have focused 
on single aspects of understanding which are defined 
by 'internal processing', we have to treat almost all 
aspects  of 'understanding texts' in MT, wh ich  are 
mutua l ly  in ter tw ined  in a compl i ca ted  manner  and 
have to be in tegrated into single computat iona l ly  
unified frameworks. Though this is an extremely hard 
task, the difficulties seem to be deeply related both 
to 'understanding texts' in a true sense and to the 
essent ia l  p roper t ies  of natura l  language. We wou ld  
also like to claim that it is time to integrate these 
two f ie lds  wi th  the i r  d i f fe rent  h i s to r ies  and 
different techniques, MT and NLU, and so to start to 
clarify what 'understanding texts' really means.
