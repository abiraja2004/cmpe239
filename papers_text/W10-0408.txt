Abstract 
Novice writers face significant challenges as 
they learn to master the broad range of skills 
that contribute to composition. Novice and 
expert writers differ considerably, and devis-
ing effective composition support tools for 
novice writers requires a clear understanding 
of the process and products of writing. This 
paper reports on a study conducted with more 
than one hundred middle grade students inter-
acting with a narrative composition support 
environment. The texts are found to pose im-
portant challenges for state-of-the-art natural 
language processing techniques.  Furthermore, 
the study investigates the language usage of 
middle grade students, the cohesion and co-
herence of the resulting texts, and the relation-
ship between students? language arts skills 
and their writing processes.  The findings sug-
gest that composition support environments 
require robust NLP tools that can account for 
the variations in students? writing in order to 
effectively support each phase of the writing 
process. 
1 Introduction 
Writing is fundamentally complex.  Writers must 
simultaneously consider a constellation of factors 
during composition, including writing task re-
quirements, knowledge of audience, domain 
knowledge, language usage, and tone (Hayes and 
Flower, 1981).  Furthermore, effective writing 
involves sophisticated higher-order cognitive 
skills, such as synthesis of ideas, critical thinking, 
and self-regulation.  Text genres, such as narrative 
or expository texts, also introduce distinct re-
quirements and conventions (Hayes and Flower, 
1981). 
Because writing itself is complex, learning to 
write poses significant challenges for students.  
The central role of writing in communication, 
knowledge organization, and sensemaking points 
to the need to devise methods and tools with which 
writing skills can be effectively taught and learned 
(Graham, 2006).  Intelligent tutoring systems 
(VanLehn, 2006) offer a promising means for de-
livering tailored writing support to students.  How-
ever, developing intelligent tutors to scaffold 
student writing poses a number of technical and 
pedagogical hurdles.  Texts written by novice writ-
ers are likely to exhibit significant variation in 
grammar, cohesion, coherence, and content qual-
ity; these characteristics are likely to be problem-
atic for analysis by current natural language 
processing tools.  Furthermore, students? individ-
ual differences in language arts skills, writing self-
efficacy, domain knowledge, and motivation can 
have pedagogical implications.  An effective intel-
ligent writing tutor must do more than just parse 
and understand student texts; it must also provide 
tailored feedback that fosters effective writing 
processes and enhances student motivation for 
writing.  
This paper explores several key questions for 
the design of intelligent composition support tools 
for novice writers.  First, it investigates the per-
formance of current syntactic parsing tools on a 
corpus of narrative texts written by middle grade 
students during interactions in a narrative composi-
56
tion support environment.  A narrative composi-
tion support environment aims to support the prin-
cipal processes of writing, such as planning, 
revision, and text production.  The second question 
the paper explores is how middle school students? 
language art skills affect the cohesion and coher-
ence of texts produced during interactions with a 
narrative composition support environment.  Third, 
the paper investigates how middle school students? 
language art skills affect their writing processes 
during interactions in a narrative composition sup-
port environment.  Studying the interactions be-
tween the environment?s support mechanisms and 
students? individual differences provides insights 
into the affordances and limitations of novices? 
writing abilities, as well as implications for the 
design of intelligent tutors for narrative writing.  
The study presented here investigates novice 
writers? composition processes during interactions 
with a narrative composition support environment.  
In the study, 127 middle grade students interacted 
with the NARRATIVE THEATRE fable composition 
support environment.  The NARRATIVE THEATRE 
uses a multimedia interface to guide students as 
they select key elements of their fable (e.g., moral, 
setting, characters), prompts students through an 
explicit, timed story planning process, and allows 
students to review their earlier planning decisions 
at any point during writing of the main text.  Stu-
dents? literacy ratings and log data from interac-
tions with the NARRATIVE THEATRE environment 
are analyzed to investigate the differences between 
high- and low-skill students and their practice of 
key composition processes in the NARRATIVE 
THEATRE environment, including planning, text 
production, and revision.  Coh-Metrix (Graesser et 
al., 2004) was also used to analyze the cohesion 
and coherence characteristics of the students? fa-
bles.  The observations from this study offer im-
portant implications for the design of intelligent 
composition support tools for novice writers. 
2 Related Work 
Since Hayes and Flower first proposed their semi-
nal model of writing nearly thirty years ago (1981), 
a rich body of work has investigated the cognitive 
functions supporting written composition.  Founda-
tional results are now in place on the core proc-
esses of writing, including idea generation 
(Galbraith et al, 2009), text production (Berninger 
et al, 2002), and revision (McCutchen et al, 
1997).  Furthermore, a detailed account of the 
composition process has begun to emerge across a 
range of writing experience levels (Graham et al, 
2002) and text genres (Langer, 1985).  
Particularly important for the design of compo-
sition support tools for novices is the emergence of 
a consensus account of the characteristics of nov-
ice writers? narrative composition processes.  Em-
pirical studies have suggested that notable 
differences exist between novice and expert writ-
ers, such as novices? use of knowledge-telling 
practices versus experts? use of knowledge-
transformation practices during text production 
(Bereiter and Scardamalia, 1987).  However, it has 
been argued that even novice writers can employ 
high-level knowledge-transformation processes 
when situated within an appropriate task environ-
ment with effective writing scaffolds (Cameron 
and Moshenko, 1996).  Other work has found that 
students? domain and linguistic knowledge influ-
ences the coherence and quality of their expository 
writings (DeGroff, 1987).  These findings under-
score the importance of investigating methods for 
effective and engaging writing instruction targeted 
at novice writers, as well as automated tools to 
tailor feedback and scaffolding to individual stu-
dents. 
In addition to grounding their work in the writ-
ing research literature, designers of composition 
support tools will likely need to avail themselves 
of the full gamut of natural language processing 
techniques to analyze students? texts with regard to 
syntax, semantics, and discourse.  However, in 
texts produced by novice writers, grammatical 
errors and incoherent discourse abound, which 
may present serious challenges for natural lan-
guage processing since the majority of current 
NLP tools have been developed for well-formed 
texts.  While existing NLP tools have been suc-
cessfully used in writing support systems designed 
for expert writers (Mahlow and Piotrowski, 2009), 
common structural issues in novice compositions 
are likely to prove problematic for current tools.  
However, recent work has begun to explore tech-
niques for handling ill-formed texts that are similar 
to those produced by novice writers.  For example, 
Gamon et al conducted a word-level analysis of 
texts written by non-native English speakers 
(2008).  Focusing on two types of errors (deter-
miners and prepositions), they use decision-tree 
57
classifiers in combination with a language model 
trained on a large English corpus to detect and 
correct erroneous selection of words.  Wagner et 
al. investigated the detection of grammatical mal-
formedness of individual sentences (2007).  They 
found it effective to combine a shallow approach 
that uses n-grams and a deep approach that uses 
syntactic parse results.  Higgins et al explored the 
overall coherence of texts written by students 
(2004).  Using support vector machines, their sys-
tem identified the portions of text that resulted in 
coherence breakdowns with regard to relatedness 
to the essay question and relatedness between dis-
course elements. 
To date, a relatively small number of intelligent 
tutoring systems have been developed to support 
student learning in the language arts, and even 
fewer have sought to specifically address writing.  
Sourcer?s Apprentice is a web-based learning envi-
ronment to help high school students gather, evalu-
ate, and integrate information for writing essays 
about history topics (Britt et al, 2004), although 
Sourcer?s Apprentice did not seek to apply NLP 
tools to understand or scaffold students? composi-
tions directly.  Other work on intelligent tutoring 
for language arts, such as Project LISTEN (Mo-
stow and Aist, 2001) and REAP (Heilman et al, 
2007), has addressed vocabulary learning and read-
ing comprehension. 
3 Narrative Corpus Acquisition 
To investigate narrative composition in novice 
writers, a study was conducted with more than one 
hundred middle grade students using a narrative 
composition support environment.  The 
NARRATIVE THEATRE (Figure 1) is an interactive 
environment designed to capture both the process 
and products of writing.1 Targeting a user popula-
tion of sixth grade students (age typically 12 years) 
and the genre of fables, the NARRATIVE THEATRE 
enables students to create stories in an environment 
that was specifically designed to scaffold novices? 
composition activities during a timed story plan-
                                                 
1 The version of the NARRATIVE THEATRE used in the study 
reported in this paper is the forerunner of a more general 
creativity support environment.  It is under development in our 
laboratory that will employ NLP techniques and intelligent 
graphics generation. The study reported here was conducted to 
inform the design of the creativity enhancement environment 
and intelligent tutoring systems to support composition.

ning and writing process.  The NARRATIVE 
THEATRE employs a multimedia interface created 
with Adobe's Flash? development platform and 
AIR runtime environment.  Its design was inspired 
by a worksheet that is widely used as part of the 
Grade 6 writing curriculum. 
During the planning phase, students select a 
moral, a setting, a cast of characters, and a set of 
objects for the story they will create.  The system 
provides nine different morals, four settings, ten 
characters, and twenty objects from which students 
may choose.  Each setting is accompanied by a 
visual representation, which can be enlarged by 
clicking on the image to highlight salient features 
of the setting.  Characters and objects are also visu-
ally represented by static graphics, which were 
designed to be neutral in gender and expression in 
order to allow students creative choice when filling 
narrative roles with the characters.  
Once the choices have been made, students are 
presented with a screen that allows them to view 
their planning decisions and begin structuring their 
fable.  The planning area allows students to make 
notes about what they would like to have happen 
during the beginning, middle, and ending.  The top 
of the page contains windows that display the set-
ting, characters, and objects that were chosen ear-
lier, and that can provide more information via a 
mouseover.  Students craft a plan for the beginning 
(setting and characters are introduced), middle 
(conflict and problem), and end (conflict resolu-
tion) of their stories.  For each of the three major 
segments of the story, they formulate a textual 
plan.  After the planning information is entered, the 
students may begin writing (Figure 1).  They then 
create the actual prose, which is entered as raw 
text.  The writing and revision phase are supported 
with a spell-correction facility.  All student activi-
ties including interface selections and the text 
streams from planning and writing are logged and 
time-stamped. 
During the study, a total of 127 sixth-grade 
middle school students (67 males, 60 females) 
participated in the study.  The students ranged in 
age from 10 to 13.  Approximately 38% of the 
students were Caucasian, 27% African-American, 
17% Hispanic or Latino, 6% Asian, 2% American 
Indian, and the remaining 10% were of mixed or 
other descent.  Students participated as part of their 
Language Arts class.  The study spanned two days 
for each student involved.  On the first day, the 
students were seated at a computer and asked to fill 
out a pre-experiment questionnaire, which required 
approximately twenty minutes.  On the second day, 
the students were again assigned to a computer.  
They were presented with the NARRATIVE 
THEATRE interface, which asked them to enter a 
unique identification number.  Once correctly en-
tered, the students were presented with a short 
instructional video that described the features and 
operation of the interface.  They were given fifteen 
minutes to complete the planning activity, which 
included choosing a setting, main characters, 
props, and deciding the beginning, middle, and end 
of their story.  Once planning was completed, or 
time ran out, the students were given another 
thirty-five minutes to write their fable.  After their 
fable was completed, the students were asked to 
complete a post-experiment questionnaire.  This 
survey was also allotted twenty minutes for com-
pletion.  In total, the study lasted ninety minutes. 
4 Findings 
Three categories of analyses were performed on 
the NARRATIVE THEATRE corpus: an analysis of 
natural language processing tool performance 
(specifically, an analysis of syntactic parsers), an 
analysis of coherence and cohesion in the written 
texts using the automated cohesion metric tool 
Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al, 2004), and an analysis 
of students? writing processes.  
As part of an investigation of students? individ-
ual differences in writing, students? language arts 
skills were measured by their scores from the prior 
year?s End-of-Grade reading test.  Subjective rat-
ings of writing ability were also obtained for each 
student from their teachers.  The reading scores 
were used in the presented analyses because they 
were obtained through systematic testing, but it is 
interesting to note that the objective reading scores 
and subjective writing scores were found to be 
strongly correlated by calculating the Spearman?s 
correlation coefficient2, rho = .798, p < .0001.  The 
high correlation suggests that reading scores can 
serve as a reasonable indicator of language arts 
skills.   
                                                 
2 Spearman?s correlation coefficient was used because of the 
ordinal nature of the reading and writing measures (Myers and 
Well, 2003).

4.1 Natural Language Processing 
Two syntactic parsing tools were used to analyze 
students? fables and develop an initial account of 
the performance of current natural language proc-
essing tools on a corpus of novice-generated narra-
tive texts. The Link Grammar Parser (Temperley, 
1995) and Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 
2003) were run on the entire corpus, and their per-
formance recorded. 
Link parsing provides insight into the number of 
grammatically malformed sentences observed in 
each fable.  Link grammars center on the notion of 
linkable entities directly combined with one an-
other, as opposed to tree-like structures.  Link pars-
ers attempt to identify one or more syntactically 
valid representations, where each entity is paired 
with another.  Passages were split into sentences 
using OpenNLP, and then run against the Link 
Grammar Parser (Temperley, 1995).  If a sentence 
had no suitable link based on the parser (e.g., ?Last 
dog I saw a great movie?), it was considered ?bro-
ken? because it lacked an appropriate linkage.  A 
ratio of sentences without appropriate linkage to 
total sentence count was used to characterize the 
link parser?s performance on each student?s fable. 
On average, the Link Grammar Parser found 
linkages for 41% of sentences (SD=.22).  Interest-
ingly, reading level was shown to have a marginal 
effect on the link parser?s success rate,  
F(2,110) = 5.78, p = .06.  Post hoc Tukey?s tests 
revealed that above-grade level readers were mar-
ginally more likely to write linkable sentences than 
at-grade level readers, p = .07.  The effect was 
strongly significant between above-grade level 
readers and below-grade level readers, p = .003. 
The Stanford parser was used to investigate the 
frequency with which sentences could be success-
fully parsed.  A parsing failure was noted any time 
the tool was forced to fall back to a PCFG parse.  
On average, the Stanford parser produced a parse 
for 91% of students? sentences.  A significant ef-
fect of reading grade-level on Stanford parser suc-
cess rate was observed, F(2,110) = 4.41, p = .015.  
Post hoc tests showed that above-grade level read-
ers wrote significantly more sentences that could 
be parsed than below-grade level readers, p = .02.  
There was also a marginal difference observed 
between below-grade level readers and at-grade 
level readers, p = .08. 
Gender was not found to have an effect on the 
percentage of linkable sentences, nor the number 
of Stanford parser failures. 
4.2 Individual Differences and Written Texts 
Several analyses were conducted to investigate 
individual differences in students? written texts.  
Analyses focused on writing length, cohesion 
characteristics, coherence characteristics, and 
spelling errors.  Fable lengths were measured in 
characters (M = 1346, SD = 601). 
A marginal effect of reading grade-level on fa-
ble length was observed, F(2,110) = 2.89, p = .06.  
Post hoc tests showed that at-grade level readers 
tended to write longer fables than below-grade 
level readers, p = .10.  Gender was also found to 
have a significant effect on writing length.  Spe-
cifically, females tended to write longer fables than 
males, F(1,110) = 4.41, p = .04.

To investigate cohesion and coherence in stu-
dents? fables, the corpus was analyzed with Coh-
Metrix, a tool for analyzing the cohesion, 
language, and readability of texts (Graesser et al, 
2004).  At the core of Coh-Metrix is a lexical ana-
lyzer, syntactic parser, part-of-speech tagger, and 
reference corpora (for LSA) that processes text and 
returns linguistic and discourse related features.  
Coh-Metrix measures several types of cohesion, as 
well as concreteness, connectives, diversity in lan-
guage, and syntactic complexity.  Concreteness is 
measured using the hypernym depth values re-
trieved from the WordNet lexical taxonomy, and 
averaged across noun and verb categories. 
Results from an analysis of reading grade-levels 
and Coh-Metrix features are presented in Table 1.  
Interestingly, above-grade level students were ob-
served to have lower causal cohesion scores than 
at-grade level or below-grade level students.  The 
converse is found in an examination of paragraph-
to-paragraph LSA scores, which are often used to 
measure semantic cohesion.  Below-grade level 
readers tended to have lower semantic cohesion 
scores than at-grade level readers.  LSA scores on 
adjacent sentences and all combinations of sen-
tences were not significant across any of the 
groups.  Sentence-to-sentence LSA scores were 
also not significant across groups.  
Gender did not have a significant effect on 
causal cohesion, hypernym depth of verbs, or 
paragraph-to-paragraph LSA values.  However, 
gender was found to have a significant effect on 
hypernym depth of nouns, F(1,110) = 15.96,  
p = .0001.  Males tended to use more concrete 
nouns in their writing passages, with an average 
difference of .6 in hypernym depth. The ratio of 
pronouns to noun phrases was also significant be-
tween genders, F(1,110) = 10.19, p = .002. Fe-
males had a 38% pronoun to NP ratio whereas 
males were at 32%.  Gender had a significant ef-
fect on sentence-to-sentence LSA scores, F(1,110) 
= 19.9, p = .0001.  Males tended to have a higher 
LSA score across adjacent sentences (M = .27, SD 
= .11) than females (M = .18, SD = .1).  Finally, 
gender had a significant effect on personal pronoun 
incidence score, F(1,110) = 9.12, p = .003.  Fe-
males used personal pronouns as 11.1% of their 
content whereas males used them as 9.3% of their 
content. 
An examination of the number of spelling errors 
remaining in student fables, as well as students? 
usage of the built-in spelling corrector, was con-
ducted.  However, no significant effects were ob-
served across reading level or gender.  
4.3 Individual Differences and Writing  
Processes 
Several features in the student interaction logs 
were chosen to investigate key aspects of students? 
writing processes.  Specifically, these features 
include planning length, planning and writing time, 
revision behavior, pauses in text production, and 
reviews of prior planning decisions.  
On average, students spent 665 seconds plan-
ning their fables and 2199 seconds writing their 
fables (SD = 535).  Students also typed 537 charac-
ters on average while planning their fables (SD = 
254).  No significant effect of reading level was 
observed on planning length, but reading level did 
have a significant effect on time spent in the plan-
ning phase, F(2,110) = 12.76, p < .0001.  Below-
grade level readers spent significantly more time

on planning than at-grade level readers, p = .001, 
as well as above-grade level readers, p < .0001.  
There were also significant differences in writing 
time across reading level groups, F(2, 110) = 6.47, 
p = .002.  Below-grade level readers took signifi-
cantly more time composing their fables than at-
grade level readers, p = .05.  Also, below-grade 
level readers took significantly more time to write 
their fables than above-grade level readers, 
p = .003. 
Females tended to write longer passages in the 
planning section than males F(1,110) = 4.68,  
p = .03.  Time spent on the planning section was 
lower among females than males, F(1,110) = 3.92, 
p = .05.  Females also spent less time on the writ-
ing section than males, F(1,110) = 3.87, p = .05. 
Students? revision behaviors were gauged using 
a heuristic that measures edit distances between 
successive snapshots of fables collected at one-
minute intervals during composition.  Each minute, 
a static snapshot of student?s fable progress was 
taken and logged.  Edit distances between succes-
sive snapshots of students? fables were measured 
using the Google Diff, Match and Patch tools to 
make ?before? and ?after? comparisons (Google, 
2009).  Comparing two successive snapshots of a 
single fable, a revision was defined as any inser-
tion of text that occurred before the tail end of the 
fable.  
The effects of reading level on revision in both 
the planning and writing stages is presented in 
Table 2.  During the writing stage, a significant 
effect of grade-level was observed on average revi-
sion length between below-grade level readers and 
at-grade level readers, as well as between below-
grade level readers and above-grade level readers.  
Within the planning section, at-grade level readers 
revised more text than below-grade level readers, 
and above-grade level readers revised more text 
than at-grade level readers.  Self-efficacy for writ-
ing was found to be significantly correlated with 
average revision length in both the planning, r = 
.21, p = .03, and writing, r = .31, p = .001, stages. 
Pauses between successive keystrokes were 
investigated during both the planning and writing 
stages of NARRATIVE THEATRE interactions.  For 
the purpose of this work, a pause is defined as a 
keystroke made five or more seconds after the 
preceding keystroke.  Keystroke pauses were cate-
gorized as either an appendage or a revision, de-
pending on whether they occurred before the tail 
end of the passage (revision) or after the tail end 
(appendage).  For the planning section, below-
grade readers paused significantly more often than 
at-grade readers.  Also, at-grade readers paused 
before revising significantly more often than 
above-grade readers.  The effects of reading level 
on a number of writing process subscores are 
shown in Table 2. 
Gender had a significant effect on pauses prior 
to revision in the writing phase, F(1,110) = 3.26, 
p = .07.  Females paused on more occasions than 
males.  However, no gender effect was found for 
pause behavior during the planning phase. 
During the planning and writing stages of 
NARRATIVE THEATRE interactions, students could 
review their prior planning selections?including 
characters, objects, and settings?by hovering the 
mouse over the respective region near the top of 
the screen (mouseover).  Upon hovering the mouse 
over the appropriate region, a graphical illustration 
of the student?s planning selection was presented.  
Mouseover instances were recorded to obtain in-
sight into idea generation, or instances where the 
student was contemplating what to write next.  
Mouseovers were calculated in terms of average 
mouseovers over time (in minutes).  The effects of 
reading ability on mouseover behaviors are shown 
in Table 2.  
For the mouseover metric, reading level had a 
significant effect on the mouseover rate.  Below-
grade level learners tended to use the mouseover 
feature on a more frequent basis than both at-grade 
level and above-grade level readers.  There was not 
a significant difference between at-grade level and 
above-grade level groups.  
The effect of gender on mouseover rate was sig-
nificant, F(1,110) = 9.93, p = .002.  Males used the 
mouseover feature on fewer occasions than fe-
males. 
5 Discussion 
The performance of the two parsers differed 
widely.  The Stanford Parser was able to parse over 
90% of fables, but the Link Grammar Parser was 
only successful for about 40% of the fables.  While 
parser failure is not always indicative of poor 
grammaticality, every sentence that failed on the 
Stanford Parser contained either misspelled words 
or run-on sentences.  Many of these were indicated 
by errors in the sentence segmentation as well.  
62
There were also indications that students? language 
arts skills may influence the grammaticality of 
their written sentences; significant effects of read-
ing level were found on both the Stanford Parser?s 
success rate and the Link parser?s success rate.  
The fact that below-grade level students consti-
tuted a considerable proportion of the study?s stu-
dent population suggests that pedagogical writing 
support tools should be capable of handling the 
variations inherent in students? writings, and lever-
age natural language processing results to inform 
tutorial feedback. 
Paragraph-to-paragraph LSA scores tended to 
increase with reading level.  This has implications 
for semantic cohesion (Graessar, 2004) and indi-
cates that students with a higher reading assess-
ment score produce stories that satisfy this 
particular dimension of cohesion.  However, the 
converse was true for the Coh-Metrix measure of 
causal cohesion, where above-grade level students 
actually produced the lowest cohesion scores.  One 
possible explanation could stem from differences 
in vocabulary skills between above- and below-
grade level students; students who exercise a larger 
vocabulary may be penalized by Coh-Metrix?s 
cohesion metric.  Alternatively, the result may be 
related to the fact that below-grade level students 
tend to produce less text (Graessar, 2004).  Clearly, 
students? individual differences in language arts 
ability affect the cohesiveness of the texts they 
write, but additional investigation is necessary to 
develop a clear understanding of the relationship 
between cohesion and language arts ability, as well 
as the implications for tailoring tutoring. 
With regard to the writing process, the average 
length per revision was significantly greater for 
students of higher reading skill-levels. There is a 
possibility that this may be associated with more 
elaborate revision processes, which requires further 
investigation. It should be noted that the revision 
finding was more salient for the planning stage of 
NARRATIVE THEATRE interactions.  This result 
may also indicate that below-grade level readers 
were somewhat less thorough when planning their 
fables.  Further, differences in mouseover behavior 
were found across reading levels, apparently indi-
cating a decline in the rate of mouseovers as read-
ing level increased. This finding may be the result 
of below-grade level students experiencing diffi-
culties in idea generation, or a lack of motivation. 
Finally, the number of pauses prior to revision was 
found to decrease as reading level increased.  This 
result may point to difficulties with text production 
for lower language arts skill students.  Difficulty 
translating ideas into text may point to a need for 
intelligent writing tutors to help reduce lower read-
ing level students? cognitive load during writing. 
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
We have presented a study conducted with middle 
grade students to investigate the process and prod-
ucts of writing in a narrative composition support 
environment.  The study found significant varia-
tions in syntactic parser performance associated 
with students? language arts abilities, as well as 
relationships between students? reading level and 
the grammaticality of their writing.  For example, 
the stories of below-grade readers had a lower 
level of semantic cohesion than at-grade level 
readers, but surprisingly, above-grade level stu-
dents? writings exhibited lower causal cohesion 
than both at-grade and below-grade level students.  
Reading level had a significant effect on time spent 
in the planning phase, and below-grade level read-
ers spent more time composing fables than at-
grade level readers.  There were also gender differ-
ences, with females spending less time in both the 
planning and writing phases.  There were also dif-
ferences with respect to revision, with above-grade 
readers revising more than below-grade readers. 
The study highlights important issues about how 
to design composition support tools.  Composition 
support tools that are sensitive to students? indi-
vidual writing abilities seem likely to be most ef-
fective.  Natural language processing is critical for 
analyzing students? texts and informing the content 
of adaptive tutorial feedback.  Intelligent writing 
tutors should utilize natural language processing 
techniques that can robustly handle the variations 
in students? writings, and deliver tailored scaffold-
ing informed by analyses of students? texts and 
writing processes.  
The findings suggest that several directions exist 
for future work.  Additional analysis is necessary 
to investigate the correctness of syntactic parses.  
Further investigation of students? individual differ-
ences in writing at the discourse and narrative lev-
els is also necessary.  Results from these analyses 
should then be used to inform the design of tech-
niques for adaptive tutorial feedback in narrative 
composition support environments.
