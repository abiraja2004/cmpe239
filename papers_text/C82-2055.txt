Theoret i ca l  semant ics  i s  concerned with the  mode l l ing  o f  
meaning proper ,  and computat iona l  semant ics  (natura l  language 
unders tand ing  sys tems,  machine t rans la t ion ,  d ia logue  
sys tems) ,  w i th  the mode l l ing  of  communicat ive meaning, or  
meaning as used purposefully by people in communication ("By 
uttering X with meaning proper Y the speaker intends a commun- 
icative maning Z'). The distinction between meaning proper 
and communicative meaning Is difficult to make since in every- 
d~7 apeech~ which is the only observable manifestation of 
meaning, people are apt to confuse the thing Itself with what 
it is intended to stand for as well as for some other reasons 
(e.g. that both meanings are slmultaneosly acquired In our 
childhood). It is clearly cutj however, in forelgn language 
acquisition. In foreigh language acquisition people learn the 
meanings of words and expressions rather than how these mean- 
ings are used for the purposes of communlcatlon~ since in the 
general case, the letter Is part of their own native language 
knowledge. This explains wh~ we speak that for a Bulgarian to 
have learned the meaning of the English I wa~t to sleep is to 
have learned that in Bulgarian It has meaning equivalents llke 
~skam da sDda~ ~ etc., and not to have learned that in 
communicative acts the former English sentence may be puPpose- 
fully used b~ the speaker wlth the Intention of stating that 
he (she) is willing to sleep, or urging someone to leave hlm 
(her) alone so that he (she) can sleep, and so on. Furthermore~

we can imagine s i tuat ions  In  which one knows the communicat- 
ive meanlng of a language express ion  without  knowing I t s  
meaning proper .  
Communicative meaning lles at the basis of our intuitive 
under~tandlng of language. Understanding of language crucial- 
1.y depends upon different mental processing accomplished by 
nat ive  speakers such as exp l i ca t ing  Imp l i c i t  connect ions  in  
sentences ,  log ica l  deducing (Schank, Rieger)  e tc .  S t r i c t ly  
speak ing,  th i s  p rocess ing  does not Invo lve meaning proper and 
as such As not a part of linguistics. In this sense, the 
claim made In ore.rant semantic theories that linguistic se- 
mantics should e3plaln the In~It lve understanding of the 
language by native speakers Is not true, unless, of course, 
the notion of llngulatlc meaning Is extended to meanlnglees- 
ness .  
In  the  paper ,  some cases o f  unacceptab le  concept ions  o f  
l ingu is t i c  meaning In  the  works o f  semant ic  theor l s ts  a re  
d i scussed .  
For  fu r ther  exp l i ca t ion  o f  the  d i f fe rence  between mean- 
lng  proper  and communicat ive  meaning ( In  the  sense above)  
classes of amblgultIes are discussed which have different 
meaning proper but still their different semantic representat- 
Ions preserve the same communicative meanlnE. These classes of 
ambiguities share the same (l) referent, (Ii) Implication, 
(Ill) presupposition, or (iv) present communicative equivalents 
In a less well-deflned way. 
In the paper, It Is noted that, In addition to deepening 
Its concept of semantics along the lines of studylng commun- 
Icative mean?ng, as an applied science, computer llnguistlos 
searches for strategies avoiding ~ather than solving some of 
Its most difficult semantical problems. 
:Two such s t ra teg ies  a r~d lscussed .  One I s  concerned with 
the tack l ing  of  the ambigui ty  between marked and unmarked 
lex lca l  i tems.  In  the  o ther ,  I t  I s  proposed that  Ins tead  of

t ry ing  to reso lve  some cases of A. Syntact i ca l  ambigu i ty ,  
and B. Semant ical  ambiguity in  the ana lys i s  (e .g .  fo r  the 
purposes o f  MT), sentences  are synthes ized  An the ta rget  
languase which are syntact i ca l ly  ambiguous ( in  the same 
sense) ,  so  that  the user  h imse l f ,  ra ther  than the l ingu is t i c  
ane lyser ,  reso lves  the ambigu i t ies  in  quest ion .  
A. John h i t  the dog with the lor~ bat (Schank) ( i t  l s  
not clear whether wlth the long b~t' is s modifier of hat or 
of do~) ma~ be translated Into Bulgarian as _D3on udarl k~etq  
which preserves the ambiguity of the original 
sentence (udarA -~ ~ or  ~ -~ P--~I~MI_;MM~) ? 
B. NOW for breakfast we shall want a f ry~n~-u.n (~arrls 
sa id  I t  was And l~est lb le ;  but we nearl ,y urged him not  to bo 
IP._aa~...) (J.K.Jerome) (it is not clear whether for break- 
fast they want to eat  the f ry ing-pan  I t se l f  or jus t  need the 
frying-pan to prepare their breakfast In it) may be translat- 
ed Into Bulgarian as the s t ruc tura~S_~L~L~ ~ 
ed ln  t i tan  da saC-a im. . .  ( v~p~.~_ J~n ~-  ~ or  
-~ titan da~zakuslm). 
As an aid to the above-mentioned strategy, a llst Is 
made (within dependency grammar framework) of 36 models of 
structural ambiguity in English and Bulgarian.
