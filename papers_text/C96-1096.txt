The paper describes problems in dis- 
ambiguating the morphological analysis 
of Bantu languages by using Swahili as 
a test language. The main factors of 
ambiguity in this language group can 
be traced to the noun class structure 
on one hand and to the bi-directional 
word-formation on the other. In analyz- 
ing word-forms, the system applied uti- 
lizes SWATWOL, a morphological pars- 
ing program based on two-level formal- 
ism. Disambiguation is carried out with 
the latest version (April 1996) of the 
Constraint Grammar Parser (GGP). Sta- 
tistics on ambiguity are provided. So- 
lutions tbr resolving different types of 
ambiguity are presented and they are 
demonstrated by examples fi'om corpus 
text. Finally, statistics on the perfor- 
mance of the disambiguator are pre- 
sented. 
In t roduct ion  
There are five principal factors in Bantu languages 
which contribute to ambiguous analysis of word- 
tbrms. First, nouns are grouped into more than 
ten marked noun classes. The marking of these 
classes extends across the noun phrase, whereby 
the noun governs the choice of markers in de- 
pendent constituents. Second, verbs inflect stem- 
initially and mark the subject, object, and rela- 
tive referent by prefixes, whereby the actual form 
of each prefix is governed by the noun class of 
the noun it refers to. In addition, verb derivation 
also adds to the complexity of verbal morphology. 
Third, reduplication is a productive phenomenon. 
Because its accurate description in lexicon is not 
possible, alternative ways in handling it are dis- 
cussed. Fourth, the majority of Bantu languages 
have a tone system, but rarely this is indicated 
in writing. This adds to morphological mbiguity. 
Fifth, various semantic functions of word-forms 
are also a source of ambiguity. 
In this paper I shall discuss the points one and 
two by using Swahili as a test language. 
1 Morpho log ica l  analysis 
The morphological analysis of Swahili is carried 
out by SWATWOL, which is based on the two- 
level formalism (Koskenniemi 1983). The ap- 
plication of this formalism to Swahili has been 
under process since 1987, and it has now, af- 
ter having been tested with a corpus of one mil- 
lion words, reached a mature phase with a recall 
of 99.8% in average running text, and precision 
of close to 100%. The performance of SWAT- 
WOL corresponds to what is reported of ENGT- 
WOL, the morphological parser of English (Vouti- 
lainen et al1992; Tapanainen and J/irvinen 1994), 
and SWETWOL, the morphological analyzer of 
Swedish (Karlsson 1992). 
SWATWOL uses a two-level rule system for 
describing morphophonological v riation, as well 
as a lexicon with 288 sub-lexicons. Unlike in 
languages with right-branching word formation, 
where word roots can be grouped together into 
a root lexicon, here word roots have been divided 
into several sub-lexicons. 
Because SWATWOL has been described in de- 
tail elsewhere (Hurskainen 1992), only a sketchy 
description of its parts is given here. 
1.1 SWATWOL rules 
Two-level rules have been written mainly for han- 
dling morhophonological processes, which occur 
principally in morpheme boundaries. Part of such 
processes take place also in verbal extensions, 
whereby the quality of the stem vowel(s) defines 
the surface form of the suffix. The total number 
of rules is 18, part of them being combined rules. 
An example of a combined rule: 
568 
U:w <=> k _ :Vo  ; 
t _ / :  a: ; 
Chanqe lexical 'U' to surface 'w' iff there is 'k' 
on the lcft and a surface character belonging to 
the set 'Vo' on the right; or there is 't' on the left 
and a lexical diacritic '/1' on the right followed by 
a lexical 'a '. 
1.2 SWATWOL lexicon 
SWATWOL lexicon is at tree, where the mor- 
phemes of Swahili are located so that each route 
f?om the root lexicon leads to a well-formed word- 
tbrm. 
The most complicated part of the lexicon is the 
description of verb-forms, which requires a total of 
:\[25 sub-lexicons. For describing verbs, there are 
a number of consecutive :prefix and suffix 'slots', 
which may or may not be filled by morphemes. 
The verb root is in the middle, and verbal exten- 
sions used mainly for derivation are suffixed to the 
root. 
A noun is composed of a class prefix and 
root. Noun roots are located in 22 separate sub- 
lexicons, and access to them is permitted from 
the corresponding class prefix(es). Adjectives are 
grouped according to whether they t, ake class pre- 
fixes or not. Also numerals are grouped according 
to the same principle. The lexicon has a total of 
about 27,000 'words'. 
Here is a simplified example of a sab-lexicon: 
LEXICON M/MI 
mU M/MIr "mU 3/4-SG N"; 
mi M/MIr "mU 3/4-PL N"; 
This is a sub-lexicon with the name 'M/MI' con- 
taining prefixes of the noun classes 3 and 4. Each 
entry may have three parts, but only the mid- 
dle part is compulsory. In the first entry, 'mU' 
is the lexical representation of a morpheme, and 
'M/MIr'  is the name of the sub-lexicon where the 
processing will continue. The third part within 
quotes is the output string. 
In constructing the lexicon, underspecification 
of analysis was avoided. Although it may be used 
for decreasing the number of ambiguous readings 
(of. Karlsson 1992), it leaves ambiguity within 
readings themselves in the form of underspecifica- 
*ion, and it has to be resolved later in any case.

was analyzed with SWATWOL, and the results in 
regard to ambiguity are given in Table 1. 
As can be seen in Table 1, about half of word- 
form tokens in Swahili are at least two-ways am- 
biguous. About one fifth of tokens are precisely 
two-ways ambiguous, and the share of three-ways 
and four-ways ambiguous tokens is almost equal, 
about 10%. The share of five-ways ambiguous 
tokens is 5.68%, but the number of still more 
ambiguous tokens decreases drastically. There 
are word-forms with more than 20 readings, tile 
largest number in the corpus being 60 readings. 
If we compare these numbers with those in Ta- 
ble 2 we note significant differences and similari- 
ties. Table 2 was constructed exactly in the same 
manner as Table 1, only the source text being dif- 
ferent. Whereas in Table 1 a corpus of running 
text (Corpus 1) was used, in Table 2 the source 
text was a list of unique word-forms (Corpus 2). 
The number of word-forms with more than one 
reading is almost equal in both corpora, slightly 
over 50%. The percentages in Table 2 decrease 
rather systematically the more readings a word- 
form has. While there were more four-ways 
ambiguous word-forms (10.97%) than three-ways 
ones (9.12%) in Table 1, in Table 2 the numbers 
are as expected. The only unexpected result is 
the share of six-ways ambiguous words (3.44%), 
which is higher than the share of the five-ways 
ambiguous ones (2.94%). In Corpus 2, the high 
percentage offour-ways ambiguous readings found 
in Corpus 1 does not exist. 
The ambiguity rate in Swahili is somewhat 
lower than in Swedish (60%, Berg 1978). It seems 
to correspond to that of English (Voutilainen ct al 
1992:5), although Dett.ose (1988) gives somewhat

lower figures, 11% for word-form types and 40% 
for word-form tokens. In Finnish the correspond- 
ing figures are still lower, 3.3% for word-form 
types and 11.2% for word-form tokens (Niemiko- 
rpi 1979). 
While the reported ambiguity counted from 
word-form tokens is generally much higher than 
that counted from word-form types, in Swahili the 
difference is small. This is due to the fact that in 
addition to ambiguity found in several of the most 
common words, verb-forms are typically ambigu- 
ous, as are almost half of the nouns. 
Karlsson (1994:23) suggests an inverse correla- 
tion between the number of unique word-forms 
and rate of ambiguity. Therefore, heavily inflect- 
ing languages would tend to produce unambigu- 
ous word-forms. Swahili does not seem to fully 
support this hypothesis, although the numbers in 
Table 1 and 2 are not directly comparable with 
results of other studies. In Swahili lexicon, under- 
specification was avoided which adds to ambiguity. 
3 Disambiguation with Constra int  
Grammar  Parser 
Morphological disambiguation as well as syntac- 
tic mapping is carried out with Constraint Gram- 
mar Parser (CGP). Descriptions of its develop- 
ment phases are found in several publications (e.g. 
Karlsson 1.990; Karlsson 1994a, 1994b; Karlsson 
et al1994; Voutilainen et al1992; Voutilainen 
and Tapanainen 1993; Tapanainen 1996). It sets 
off from the idea that rather than trying to write 
rules by pointing out the conditions necessary for 
the acceptance of a reading in an ambiguous case, 
it allows the writing of such rules that discard a 
certain reading as illegitimate. The rule system is 
typically a combination of deletion and selection 
rules. 
The morphological nalyzer SWATWOL was so 
designed that it would be ideal for further process- 
ing with CGP. The output of SWATWOL contains 
such information as part-of-speech features, fea- 
tures for adjectives, verbs, adverbs, nouns, numer- 
als, and pronouns, as well as information on noun 
class marking (also zero marking) wherever it oc- 
curs, etc. In the present application also syntactic 
tags are included into the morphological lexicon 
as far as the marking can be done unambiguously. 
The syntactic mapping of context-sensitive word- 
forms is left to the CGP. 
In order to simplify disambiguatiOn, fixed 
phrases, idioms, multi-word prepositions and non- 
ambiguous collocations are joined together al- 
ready in the preprocessing phase of the text (e.g. 
mbele ya > mbele_ya 'in front of'), and the same 
constructions are written into the lexicon with 
corresponding analysis. 
3.1 Const ra in t  Grammar  ru le  fo rmal i sm 
The subsequent discussion of the Constraint 
Grammar Parser is based on the formalism of 
Tapanainen (1996). A detailed description of an 
earlier version of CGP is in Karlsson (1994b). The 
CGP rule file has the following sections (optional 
ones in parentheses): 
DELIMITERS 
(PREFERRED-TARGET) 
(SETS) 
(MAPPINGS) 
CONSTRAINTS 
END 
In DELIMITERS, those tags are listed which 
mark the boundary of context conditions. If the 
rule system tries to remove all readings of a cohort, 
the target listed in the section PREFERRED- 
TARGET is the one which survives. SETS is a 
section where groups of tags are defined. Syntac- 
tic parsing is carried out with rules located under 
the heading MAPPINGS. CONSTRAINTS con- 
tains constraint rules with tile following schema: 
\[WORDFORM\] OPERATION (target) 
\[(context condition(s) )\] 
WORDFORM can be any surface word-form, 
for which a rule will be written. OPERATION 
may have two forms: REMOVE and SELECT. 
These are self-explanatory. In TARGET is de- 
fined the concrete morphological tag (or sequence 
of tags), to which the operation is applied. A tar- 
get may be also a set, which is defined in the SETS 
570 
section. If the target is left without parentheses it 
is interpreted as a set. CONTEXT CONDITIONS 
is an optional part, but in most cases necessary. 
In it, conditions for the application of tile rule are 
defined in detail. Context conditions are defined 
in relation to the target reading, which has the 
default  position 0. Positive integers refer to the 
number of words to the right, and the negative 
ones to the left. In context conditions, reference 
can be made to any of the features or tags found 
in the unambiguous reading, e.g. (1C ADJ), or in 
the whole cohort, e.g. (1 ADJ). These references 
can be made either directly to a tag or indirectly 
through sets, which are defined in a special section 
(SETS) of the rule formalism. 
Any context may also be negated by placing the 
key-word NOT to the beginning of the context 
clause. It is also possible to refer to more than 
one context in the same position. 
If there is a need to define further conditions 
for a reading found by scanning (by using position 
markers *-1 or *1), the linking mechanism ay be 
used. This can be done by adding the key-word 
LINK to the context, whereafter the new context 
follows. For example, the context condition (*-1 
N LINK 1 PP~ON LINK 1 ADJ) reads: 'there is a 
noun (N) on the left followed by pronoun (PI{ON) 
followed by and adjective (ADJ)'. 
3.2 Order  of  ru les 
The algorithm allows a sequential rule order. This 
can be done by grouping the rules into separate 
sections. The sequential order of rules within a 
section does not guarantee that the rules are ap- 
plied in the order where they appear. The rules 
of the first section are applied first. Any num- 
ber of consecutive sections can be used. There 
are presently four sections of constraint rules in 
the rule file. Certain types of rules should be ap- 
plied first, without giving a possibility to other, less 
clearly stated, rules to interfere. Typical of such 
first-level rules are those where disambiguation is 
done within a phrase structure. In intermediate 
sections there are rules which use larger struc- 
tures for disambiguation. By first disambiguating 
noun phrases and genitive constructions, the use 
of otherwise too permissive rules becomes possi- 
ble, when clear cases are already disambiguated. 
The disambiguation f verbJorms belongs to these 
middle levels. 2?he risk of wrong interpretations 
decreases ubstantially by first disambiguating 
noun phrases and other smaller units. 
The CGP of Swahili has presently a total of 656 
rules in four different sections for disambiguation 
and 50 rules for syntactic mapping. So far about 
600 hours have been used for writing and testing 
rnles.

The CG rules reduce the number of multiple 
readings so that optimally only one reading sur- 
vives. Rule S:816 removes an object reading of 
the word-form. After that, a selection rule S:1099 
is applied. 
SELECT (I/2-PL N) 
(i NCL-2 + GEN-CON) ; 
Select noun reading of Ncl 1/2-PL if followed 
immediately by genitive connector belonging to the 
set NCL-2. This description is equal to the gram- 
matical rule. Also other rules follow the same 
principle. E.g. the reading 1/2-PL GEN-CON 
is chosen for the analysis of wa on the basis of the 
Ncl of the preceding noun. The rule states: 
"<wa>" SELECT (1/2-eL)  
( - t  NCL-2) ; 
Select Ncl 1/2-PL of the word 'wa' if in the pre- 
ceding cohort there is a feature belonging to the set 
NCL-2. 
Although both washiriki and wa are initially 
ambiguous, and in rules the context reference does 
not extend beyond this pair of words, we get the 
correct result. This is because in both of the co- 
horts there is only one such reading which refers 
to the same noun class. 
The word semina is both SG and PL, and the 
following pronoun zote, which has the PL read- 
ing, solves the problem. The word nchi is dis- 
ambiguated with a rule relying on the Ncl of the 
following genitive connector (GEN-CON). 
The word katika has four readings. The gram- 
matically correct way of disambiguating it is by 
referring to the following word. 
"<katika>" SELECT (PREPOS) 
(I N OR INF OR PRON) 
Select the reading PREPOS of "katika" if there is 
a noun or infinitive of a verb or pronoun in the 
following cohort.

The CGP of Swahili was tested with two text cor- 
pora, which had not been used as test material 
in writing rules: E. Kezilahabi's novel Mzingile 
(22,984 word-form tokens), and a collection of 
newspaper texts from the weekly paper Mzalendo, 
1994 (49,969 word-form tokens). Test results are 
in Table 3. 
Table 3: Ambiguity after processing with the 
Swahili CGP. N(t) = number of word-form tokens, 
N(w) = number of unique word-forms, amb-(t) 
= ambiguity in tokens, amb-(w) = ambiguity in 
unique word-forms. 
Ambiguity Mzingile Mzalendo 
N(t) 22,984 49,968 
N(w) 5,914 9,359 
amb-(t) 1,837 2,463 
% 7.99 4.93 
amb-(w) 721 831 
% 12.19 8.88 
The parser performed best with newspaper 
texts, leaving ambiguity to 4.9% of tokens. Yet 
the overall result has to be considered promising, 
given that the parser is still under development 
and that the rules are almost solely grammar- 
based. 
The most common types of ambiguity still re- 
maining are: noun vs. adverb, adjective vs. ad- 
verb, noun vs. conjunction, verb (imperative) vs. 
noun, and verb (infinitive) vs. noun. Those are 
typically in such positions in a sentence that writ- 
ing of reliable rules is difficult. A fairly large part 
of remaining ambiguity concerns genitive connec- 
tors ya and wa, and possessive pronouns. They are 
generally in positions where the governing noun is 
beyond the current clause or sentence boundary 
on the left. For such cases, the rule syntax should 
572 
allow the use of more distantly located informa- 
tion. 
The vast majority of constraints are selection 
rules for resolving ambiguity based on homo- 
graphic noun class agreement markers, lit is pos- 
sible to resolve most of this ambiguity by using 
contextual information. 
Conc lus ion  
The morphologicM anMysis of SwMfili tends to 
produce a comparatively large number of ambigu- 
ous readings. The noun class structure coupled 
with class agreement marking in dependent con- 
stituents, contributes ignificantly to ambiguity. 
The phenomenon is particularly evident in verb 
structures, where different sets of noun class mark- 
ers add to the ambiguity of the same verb-form. It 
is assumed that the solutions uggested here apply 
Mso to other Bantu languages. 
The ambiguity resolution is based on the Con- 
straint Grammar formMism, which allows tile use 
of grammatically motivated rules. The maximal 
context in the present application is a sentence, 
but there is a need for extending it over sentence 
boundaries. ConstrMnt rules are grouped into sec- 
tions, so thai; the most obvious cases are disam- 
biguated first. A parser wiLt~ only grammar-based 
rules disambiguatcs M)out 95% or Swahili word- 
tbrms from running text, which initiMly has about 
50% of the tokens ambiguous. The remaining am- 
biguity is hard to resolve fully safely, but proba- 
bilistic and hcnristic techniques are likely to still 
improve tile pertbrmance.
