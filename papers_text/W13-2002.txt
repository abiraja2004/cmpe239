Abstract
The Genia Event Extraction task is orga-
nized for the third time, in BioNLP Shared
Task 2013. Toward knowledge based con-
struction, the task is modified in a num-
ber of points. As the final results, it re-
ceived 12 submissions, among which 2
were withdrawn from the final report. This
paper presents the task setting, data sets,
and the final results with discussion for
possible future directions.
1 Introduction
Among various resources of life science, litera-
ture is regarded as one of the most important types
of knowledge base. Nevertheless, lack of explicit
structure in natural language texts prevents com-
puter systems from accessing fine-grained infor-
mation written in literature. BioNLP Shared Task
(ST) series (Kim et al, 2009; Kim et al, 2011a)
is one of the community-wide efforts to address
the problem. Since its initial organization in 2009,
BioNLP-ST series has published a number of fine-
grained information extraction (IE) tasks moti-
vated for bioinformatics projects. Having solicited
wide participation from the community of natural
language processing, machine learning, and bioin-
formatics, it has contributed to the production of
rich resources for fine-grained BioIE, e.g., TEES1
(Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011), SBEP2 (McClosky
et al, 2011) and EVEX3 (Van Landeghem et al,
2011).
The Genia Event Extraction (GE) task is a sem-
inal task of BioNLP-ST. It was first organized as
the sole task of the initial 2009 edition of BioNLP-
ST. The task was originally designed and imple-
mented based on the Genia event corpus (Kim et
1https://github.com/jbjorne/TEES/wiki
2http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/eventparser.shtml
3http://www.evexdb.org/
al., 2008b) which represented domain knowledge
around NF?B proteins. There were also some ef-
forts to explore the possibility of literature mining
for pathway construction (Kim et al, 2008a; Oda
et al, 2008). The GE task was designed to make
such an effort a community-driven one by sharing
available resources, e.g., benchmark data sets, and
evaluation tools, with the community.
In its second edition (Kim et al, 2011b) orga-
nized in BioNLP-ST 2011 (Kim et al, 2011a), the
data sets were extended to include full text articles.
The data sets consisted of two collections. The ab-
stract collection, that had come from the first edi-
tion, was used again to measure the progress of the
community between 2009 and 2011 editions, and
the full text collection, that was newly created, was
used to measure the generalization of the technol-
ogy to full text papers.
In its third edition this year, while succeeding
the fundamental characteristics from its previous
editions, the GE task tries to evolve with the goal
to make it a more ?real? task toward knowledge
base construction. The first design choice to ad-
dress the goal is to construct the data sets fully
with recent full papers, so that the extracted pieces
of information can represent up-to-date knowl-
edge of the domain. The abstract collection, that
had been already used twice (in 2009 and 2011), is
removed from official evaluation this time4. Sec-
ond, GE task subsumes the coreference task which
has long been considered critical for improvement
of event extraction performance. It is implemented
by providing coreference annotation in integration
with event annotation in the data sets.
The paper explains the task setting and data sets,
presents the final results of participating systems,
and discusses notable observations with conclu-
sions.
4However, if necessary, the online evaluation for the pre-
vious editions of GE task may be used, which is available at
http://bionlp-st.dbcls.jp/GE/.

2 Task setting
This section explains the task setting of the 2013
edition of the GE task with a focus on changes to
previous editions. For comprehensive explanation,
readers are referred to Kim et al (2009).
The changes made to the task setting are three-
folds, among which two are about event types
to be extracted. Table 1 shows the event types
and their arguments targeted in the 2013 edition.
First, four new event types are added to the target
of extraction; the Protein modification
type and its three sub-types, Ubiquitination,
Acetylation, Deacetylation. Second,
The Protein modification types are modi-
fied to be directly linked to causal entities, which
was only possible through Regulation events
in previous editions.
The modifications were made based on analy-
sis on preliminary annotation during preparation
of the data sets: in recent papers on NF?B, dis-
cussions on protein modification were observed
with non-trivial frequency. However, in the end,
it turned out that the influence of the above modi-
fications was trivial in terms of the number of an-
notated instances in the final data sets, as shown
in section 3, after filtering out events on non-
individual proteins, e.g., protein families, protein
complexes.
Third change made to the task setting is addition
of coreference and part-of annotations to the data
sets. It is to address the observation from 2009
edition that coreference structures and entity rela-
tions often hide the syntactic paths between event
triggers and their arguments, restricting the perfor-
mance of event extraction. In 2011, the Protein
coreference task and Entity Relation were orga-
nized as sub-tasks, to explicitly address the prob-
lem, but this time, coreference and part-of anno-
tations are integrated in the GE task, to encour-
age an integrative use of them for event extrac-
tion. Figure 1 shows an example of annotation
with coreference and part-of annotations5. Note
that the event representation in the figure is re-
lation centric6, which is different from the event
centric representation of the default BioNLP-ST
format. The two representations are interchange-
able, and the GE task provides data sets in both
formats, together with an automatic converter be-
tween them. Below is the corresponding annota-
tion in the BioNLP-ST format:
T8 Protein 933 938 TRAF1
T9 Protein 940 945 TRAF2
T10 Protein 947 952 TRAF3
T11 Protein 958 963 TRAF6

E7 Binding:T48 Theme:T11 Theme2:T13 Site2:T49
In the example, the event trigger, binding, de-
notes four binding events, in which the four pro-
teins, TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, bind
to the protein, CD40, respectively, through the
site, cytoplasmic tail. The links between the four

proteins and the event trigger are however very
hard to find, without being bridged by the demon-
strative noun phrase (NP), These proteins. In the
case, if the link between the demonstrative NP,
These proteins and its four antecedents, TRAF1,
TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, can be somehow de-
tected, the remaining link, between the demonstra-
tive NP and the trigger, may be detected by their
syntactic connection. A key point here is the dif-
ferent characteristics of the two step links: de-
tecting the former is rather semantic or discour-
sal while the latter may be a more syntactic prob-
lem. Then, solving them using different processes
would make a sense. To encourage an exploration
into the hypothesis, the coreference annotation is
provided in the training and development data sets.
Based on the definition of event types, the en-
tire task is divided into three sub-tasks addressing
event extraction at different levels of specificity:
Task 1. Core event extraction addresses the ex-
traction of typed events together with their
primary arguments.
Task 2. Event enrichment addresses the extrac-
tion of secondary arguments that further
specify the events extracted in Task 1.
Task 3. Negation/Speculation detection
addresses the detection of negations and
speculations over the extracted events.
For more detail of the subtasks, readers are re-
ferred to Kim et al (2011b).

3 Data Preparation
As discussed in section 1, for the 2013 edition, the
data sets are constructed fully with full text pa-
pers. Table 2 shows statistics of three data sets for
training, development and test. The data sets con-
sist of 34 full text papers from the Open Access
subset of PubMed Central. The papers were re-
trieved using lexical variants of the term, ?NF?B?
as primary keyword, and ?pathway? and ?regula-
tion? as secondary keywords. The retrieved papers
were given to the annotators with higher priority

Table 3: Statistics of annotations in different sections of text: the Abstract column is of the abstraction
collection (1210 titles and abstracts), and the following columns are of full paper collection (14 full
papers). TIAB = title and abstract, Intro. = introduction and background, R/D/C = results, discussions,
and conclusions, Methods = methods, materials, and experimental procedures. Some minor sections,
supporting information, supplementary material, and synopsis, are ignored. Density = relative density of
annotation (P/W = Protein/Word, E/W = Event/Word, and E/P = Event/Protein).
Figure 2: Event distribution in different sections
to newer ones. Note that among 34 papers, 14
were from the full text collection of 2011 edition
data sets, and 20 were newly collected this time.
The annotation to the all 34 papers were produced
by the same annotators who also produced anno-
tations for the previous editions of GE task.
The annotated papers are divided into the train-
ing, development, and test data sets; 10, 10, and
14, respectively. Note that the size of the training
data set is much smaller than previous editions,
in terms of number of words and events, while
the size of the development and test data sets are
comparable to previous editions. It is the conse-
quence of a design choice of the organizers with
the notion that (1) relevant resources are substan-
tially accumulated through last two editions, and
that (2) therefore the importance of training data
set may be reduced while the importance of devel-
opment and test data sets needs to be kept. Instead,
participants may utilize, for example, the abstract
collection of the 2011 edition, of which the anno-
tation was produced by the same annotators with
almost same principles. As another example, the
data sets of the EPI task (Ohta et al, 2011) also
may be utilized for the newly added protein modi-
fication events.
Table 3 shows the statistics of annotated event
types in different sections of the full papers in the
data sets. For the analysis, the sections are classi-
fied to five groups as follows:
? The TIAB group includes the titles and
abstracts. In the GE-2011 data sets,
the corresponding files match the pattern,
PMC-*TIAB*.txt.
? The Intro group includes sections
for introduction, and background. The
corresponding files match the pattern,

Figure 2 illustrates the different distribution of
annotated event types in the five section groups.
It shows that the Methods group has signifi-
cantly different distribution of annotated events,
confirming a similar observation reported in Kim
et al (2011b).
4 Participation
The GE task received final submissions from 12
teams, among which 2 were withdrawn from final
report. Table 4 summarizes the teams. Unfortu-
nately, the subtasks 2 and 3 did not met a large
participation.
Table 5 profiles the participating systems. The
systems are roughly grouped into SVM-based
pipeline (EVEX, TEES-2.1, and DlutNLP),
rule-based pipeline (BioSEM and UZH), mixed
pipeline (USheff and HCMUS), joint pattern
matching (NCBI and NICTANLM), and joint SVM
(HDS4NLP) systems. In terms of use of ex-
ternal resources, 5 teams (EVEX, TEES-2.1,
NCBI, DlutNLP, and USheff) utilized data sets
from 2011 edition, and two teams (HDS4NLP and
NICTANLM) utilized independent resources, e.g.,
UniProt (Bairoch et al, 2005), IntAct (Kerrien et
al., 2012), and CRAFT (Verspoor et al, 2012).
5 Results and Discussions
Table 6 shows the final results of subtask 1. Over-
all EVEX, TEES-2.1, and BioSEM show the
best performance only with marginal difference
between them. In detail, the performance of
BioSEM is significantly different from EVEX and
TEES-2.1: (1) while BioSEM show the best per-
formance with Binding and Protein modification
events, EVEX and TEES-2.1 show the best per-
formance with Regulation events which takes the
largest portion of annotation in data sets; and (2)
while the performance of EVEX and TEES-2.1
is balanced over recall and precision, BioSEM is
biased for precision, which is a typical feature of
rule-based systems. It is also notable that BioSEM
has achieved a near best performance using only
shallow parsing. Although it is not shown in the
table, NCBI is the only system which produced
Ubiquitination events, which is interpreted
as a result of utilizing 2011-EPI data sets (Ohta et
al., 2011) for the system development.
Table 7 shows subtask 1 final results only within
TIAB sections. It shows that the systems de-
veloped utilizing previous resources, e.g., 2011
data sets, and EVEX, perform better for titles and
abstracts, which makes sense because those re-
sources are title and abstract-centric.
Tables 8 and 9 show evaluation results within
Methods and Captions section groups, respec-
tively. All the systems show their worst per-
formance in the two section groups. Especially
the drop of performance with regulation events is
huge. Note the two section groups also show sig-
nificantly different event distribution compared to
other section groups (see section 3). It suggests
that language expression in the two section groups
may be quite different from other sections, and an
extensive examination is required to get a reason-
able performance in the sections.
Table 10 and 11 show final results of Task 2
(Event enrichment) and 3 (Negation/Speculation
detection), respectively, which unfortunately did
not meet a large participation.
6 Conclusions
In its third edition, the GE task is fully changed
to a full text paper centric task, while the online
evaluation service on the abstract-centric data sets

is kept maintained. Unfortunately, the corefer-
ence annotation, which has been integrated in the
event annotation in the data sets, was not exploited
by the participants, during the official shared task
period. An analysis shows that the performance
of systems significantly drops in the Methods and
Captions sections, suggesting for an extensive ex-
amination in the sections.
As usual, after the official shared task period,
the GE task is maintaining an online evaluation
that can be freely accessed by anyone but with
a time limitation; once in 24 hours per a per-
son. With a few new features that are introduced
in 2013 editions but are not fully exploited by
the participants, the organizers solicit participants
to continuously explore the task using the online
evaluation. The organizers are also planning to
provide more resources to the participants, based
on the understanding that interactive communica-
tion between organizers and participants is impor-
tant for progress of the participating systems and
also the task itself.
