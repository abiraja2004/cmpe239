Abstract
While there has been much work on compu-
tational models to predict readability based
on the lexical, syntactic and discourse prop-
erties of a text, there are also interesting open
questions about how computer generated text
should be evaluated with target populations.
In this paper, we compare two offline methods
for evaluating sentence quality, magnitude es-
timation of acceptability judgements and sen-
tence recall. These methods differ in the ex-
tent to which they can differentiate between
surface level fluency and deeper comprehen-
sion issues. We find, most importantly, that
the two correlate. Magnitude estimation can
be run on the web without supervision, and
the results can be analysed automatically. The
sentence recall methodology is more resource
intensive, but allows us to tease apart the flu-
ency and comprehension issues that arise.
1 Introduction
In Natural Language Generation, recent approaches
to evaluation tend to consider either ?naturalness? or
?usefulness?. Following evaluation methodologies
commonly used for machine translation and sum-
marisation, there have been attempts to measure nat-
uralness in NLG by comparison to human generated
gold standards. This has particularly been the case
in evaluating referring expressions, where the gen-
erated expression can be treated as a set of attributes
and compared with human generated expressions
(Gatt et al, 2009; Viethen and Dale, 2006), but there
have also been attempts at evaluating sentences this
way. For instance, Langkilde-Geary (2002) gener-
ate sentences from a parsed analysis of an existing
sentence, and evaluate by comparison to the origi-
nal. However, this approach has been criticised at
many levels (see for example, Gatt et al (2009) or
Sripada et al (2003)); for instance, because there are
many good ways to realise a sentence, because typi-
cal NLG tasks do not come with reference sentences,
and because fluency judgements in the monolingual
case are more subtle than for machine translation.
Readability metrics, by comparison, do not rely
on reference texts, and try to model the linguistic
quality of a text based on features derived from the
text. This body of work ranges from the Flesch Met-
ric (Flesch, 1951), which is based on average word
and sentence length, to more systematic evaluations
of various lexical, syntactic and discourse charac-
teristics of a text (cf. Pitler et al (2010), who as-
sess readability of textual summaries). Some re-
searchers have also suggested measuring edit dis-
tance by using a human to revise a system generated
text and quantifying the revisions made (Sripada et
al., 2003). This does away with the need for ref-
erence texts and is quite suited to expert domains
such as medicine or weather forecasting, where a do-
main expert can easily correct system output. Anal-
ysis of these corrections can provide feedback on
problematic content and style. We have previously
evaluated text reformulation applications by asking
readers which version they prefer (Siddharthan et
al., 2011), or through the use of Likert scales (Lik-
ert, 1932) for measuring meaning preservation and
grammaticality (Siddharthan, 2006). However, none
of these approaches tell us very much about the com-
prehensibility of a text for an end reader.
To address this, there has been recent interest in
task based evaluations. Task based evaluations di-
rectly evaluate generated utterances for their utility
17
to the hearer. However, while for some generation
areas like reference (Gatt et al, 2009), the real world
evaluation task is obvious, it is less so for other gen-
eration tasks such as surface realisation or text-to-
text regeneration or paraphrase. We are thus keen
to investigate psycholinguistic methods for investi-
gating sentence processing as an alternative to task
based evaluations.
In the psycholinguistics literature, various offline
and online techniques have been used to investigate
sentence processing by readers. Online techniques
(eye-tracking (Duchowski, 2007), neurophysiologi-
cal (Friederici, 1995), etc.) offer many advantages
in studying how readers process a sentence. But
as these are difficult to set up and also resource in-
tensive, we would prefer to evaluate NLG using of-
fline techniques. Some offline techniques, such as
Cloze tests (Taylor, 1953) or question answering, re-
quire careful preparation of material (choice of texts
and questions, and for Cloze, the words to leave
out). Other methods, such as magnitude estima-
tion and sentence recall (cf. Sec 3 for details), are
more straightforward to implement. In this paper,
we investigate magnitude estimation of acceptabil-
ity judgements and delayed sentence recall in the
context of an experiment investigating generation
choices when realising causal relations. Our goal
is to study how useful these methods are for evaluat-
ing surface level fluency and deeper comprehensibil-
ity. We are interested in whether they can distinguish
between similar sentences, and whether they can be
used to test hypotheses regarding the effect of com-
mon generation decisions such as information order
and choice of discourse marker. We briefly discuss
the data in Section 2, before describing our experi-
ments (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). We finish with a dis-
cussion of their suitability for more general evalua-
tion of NLG with target readers.
2 Data
We use a dataset created to explore generation
choices in the context of expressing causal re-
lations; specifically, the choice of periphrastic
causative (Wolff et al, 2005) and information order.
The dataset considers four periphrastic causatives
(henceforth referred to as discourse markers): ?be-
cause?, ?because of ?, the verb ?cause? and the noun
?cause? with different lexico-syntactic properties.
We present an example from this dataset below (cf.
Siddharthan and Katsos (2010) for details):
(1) a. Fructose-induced hypertension is caused
by increased salt absorption by the intestine
and kidney. [b caused-by a]
b. Increased salt absorption by the intestine
and kidney causes fructose-induced hyper-
tension. [a caused b]
c. Fructose-induced hypertension occurs be-
cause of increased salt absorption by the in-
testine and kidney. [b because-of a]
d. Because of increased salt absorption by the
intestine and kidney, fructose-induced hy-
pertension occurs. [because-of ab]
e. Fructose-induced hypertension occurs be-
cause there is increased salt absorption by
the intestine and kidney. [b because a]
f. Because there is increased salt absorp-
tion by the intestine and kidney, fructose-
induced hypertension occurs. [because ab]
g. Increased salt absorption by the intestine
and kidney is the cause of fructose-induced
hypertension. [a cause-of b]
h. The cause of fructose-induced hypertension
is increased salt absorption by the intestine
and kidney. [cause-of ba]
In this notation, ?a? represents the cause,?b? rep-
resents the effect and the remaining string indi-
cates the discourse marker; their ordering reflects
the information order in the sentence, for exam-
ple, ?a cause-of b? indicates a cause-effect informa-
tion order using ?cause of? as the discourse marker.
The dataset consists of 144 sentences extracted from
corpora (18 sentences in each condition (discourse
marker + information order), reformulated manually
to generated the other seven conditions, resulting in
1152 sentences in total.
Clearly, different formulations have different lev-
els of fluency. In this paper we explore what two of-
fline sentence processing measures can tell us about
their acceptability and ease of comprehension.
3 Method
3.1 Magnitude estimation of acceptability
Human judgements for acceptability for each of the
1152 sentences in the dataset were obtained using
the WebExp package (Keller et al, 2009). Note that
18
the reformulations are, strictly speaking, grammati-
cal according to the authors? judgement. We are test-
ing violations of acceptability, rather than grammat-
icality per se. This mirrors the case of NLG, where
a grammar is often used for surface realisation, en-
suring grammaticality.
Acceptability is a measure which reflects
both ease of comprehension and surface well-
formedness. We later compare this experiment
with a more qualitative comprehension experiment
based on sentence recall (cf. Section 3.2). Rather
than giving participants a fixed scale, we used the
magnitude estimation paradigm, which is more
suitable to capture robust or subtle differences
between the relative strength of acceptability or
grammaticality violations (see, for example, Bard
et al (1996); Cowart (1997); Keller (2000)). One
advantage of magnitude estimation is that the
researcher does not make any assumptions about
the number of linguistic distinctions allowed. Each
participant makes as many distinctions as they feel
comfortable. Participants were given the following
instructions (omitting those that relate to the web
interface):
1. Judge acceptability of construction, not of
meaning;
2. There is no limit to the set of numbers you can
use, but they must all be positive - the lowest
score you can assign is 0. In other words, make
as many distinctions as you feel comfortable;
3. Always score the new sentence relative to the
score you gave the modulus sentence, which
you will see on the top of the screen;
4. Acceptability is a continuum, do not just make
yes/no judgements on grammaticality;
5. Try not to use a fixed scale, such as 1?5, which
you might have used for other linguistic tasks
previously.
Design: The propositional content of 144 sen-
tences was presented in eight conditions. Eight par-
ticipant groups (A?H) consisting of 6 people each
were presented with exactly one of the eight formu-
lations of each of 144 different sentences, as per a
Latin square design. This experimental design al-
lows all statistical comparisons between the eight
types of causal formulations and the three genres to
be within-participant. The participants were Uni-
versity of Cambridge students (all native English
speakers). Participants were asked to score how ac-
ceptable a modulus sentence was, using any positive
number. They were then asked to score other sen-
tences relative to this modulus, so that higher scores
were assigned to more acceptable sentences. Scores
were normalised to allow comparison across partic-
ipants, following standard practice in the literature,
by using the z-score: For each participant, each sen-
tence score was normalised so that the mean score
is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 (zih =
xih??h
?h
),
where zih is participant h?s z-score for the sentence
i when participant h gave a magnitude estimation
score of xih to that sentence. ?h is the mean and ?h
the standard deviation of the set of magnitude esti-
mation scores for user h.
3.2 Sentence Recall
Acceptability ratings are regarded as a useful mea-
sure because they combine surface judgements of
grammaticality with deeper judgements about how
easy a sentence is to understand. However, one
might want to know whether an inappropriate for-
mulation can cause a breakdown in comprehension
of the content of a sentence, which would go beyond
the (perhaps) non-detrimental effect of a form that is
dispreferred at the surface level. To try and learn
more about this, we conducted a second behavioural
experiment using a sentence recall methodology. As
these experiments are harder to conduct and have to
be supervised in a lab (to ensure that participants
have similar conditions of attention and motivation,
and to prevent ?cheating? using cut-and-paste or
note taking techniques), we selected a subset of 32
pairs of items from the previous experiment. Each
pair consisted of two formulations of the same sen-
tence. The pairs were selected in a manner that ex-
hibited a variation in the within-pair difference of
acceptability. In other words, we wanted to explore
whether two formulations of a sentences with sim-
ilar acceptability ratings were recalled equally well
and whether two formulations of a sentence with dif-
ferent acceptability ratings were recalled differently.
Design: 32 students at the University of Cam-
bridge were recruited (these are different partici-
19
pants from those in the acceptability experiment in
Section 3.1, but were also all native speakers). We
created four groups A?D, each with eight partici-
pants. Each Group saw 16 sentences in exactly one
of the two formulation types, such that groups A?B
formed one Latin square and C?D formed another
Latin square. These 16 sentences were interleaved
with 9 filler sentences that did not express causal-
ity. For each item, a participant was first shown
a sentence on the screen at the rate of 0.5 seconds
per word. Then, the sentence was removed from the
screen, and the participant was asked to do two arith-
metic tasks (addition and subtraction of numbers be-
tween 10 and 99). The purpose of these tasks was to
add a load between target sentence and recall so that
the recall of the target sentence could not rely on
internal rehearsal of the sentence. Instead, research
suggests that in such conditions recall is heavily de-
pendent on whether the content and form was ac-
tually comprehended (Lombardi and Potter, 1992;
Potter and Lombardi, 1990). Participants then typed
what they recalled of the sentence into a box on the
screen.
We manually coded the recalled sentences for six
error types (1?6) or perfect recall (0) as shown in
Table 1. Further, we scored the sentences based
on our judgements of how bad each error-type was.
The table also shows the weight for each error type.
For any recalled sentences, only one of (0,1,5,6) is
coded, i.e., these codes are mutually exclusive, but
if none of the positive scores (0,1,5,6) have been
coded, any combination of error types (2,3,4) can
be coded for the same sentence.
4 Results
4.1 Correlation between the two methods
The correlation between the differences in accept-
ability (using average z-scores for each formula-
tion from the magnitude estimation experiment) and
recall scores (scored as described above) for the
32 pairs of sentences was found to be significant
(Spearman?s rho=.43; p=.01). A manual inspec-
tion of the data showed up one major issue regard-
ing the methodologies: our participants appear to
penalise perceived ungrammaticalities in short sen-
tences quite harshly when rating acceptability, but
they have no trouble recalling such sentences ac-
curately. For example, sentence a. in Example 2
below had an average acceptability score of 1.41,
while sentence b. only scored .13, but both sentences
were recalled perfectly by all participants in the re-
call study:
(2) a. It is hard to imagine that it was the cause of
much sadness.
b. It is hard to imagine that because of it there
was much sadness.
Indeed the sentence recall test failed to discrimi-
nate at all for sentences under 14 words in length.
When we removed pairs with sentences under 14
words (there were eight such pairs), the correlation
between the differences in magest and recall scores
for the 24 remaining pairs of sentences was even
stronger (Spearman?s rho=.64; p<.001).
Summary: The two methodologies give very dif-
ferent results for short sentences. This is because
comprehension is rarely an issue for short sentences,
while surface level disfluencies are more jarring to
participants in such short sentences. For longer sen-
tences, the two methods correlate strongly; for such
sentences, magnitude estimations of acceptability
better reflect ease of comprehension. In retrospect,
this suggests that the design of an appropriate load
(we used two arithmetic sums) is an important con-
sideration that can affect the usefulness of recall
measures. One could argue that acceptability is a
more useful metric for evaluating NLG as it com-
bines surface level fluency judgements with ease of
comprehension issues. In Siddharthan and Katsos
(2010), we described how this data could be used to
train an NLG component to select the most accept-
able formulation of a sentence expressing a causal
relation. We now enumerate other characteristics
of magnitude estimation of acceptability that make
them useful for evaluating sentences. Then, in Sec-
tion 4.3, we discuss what further information can be
gleaned from sentence recall studies.
4.2 Results of magnitude estimation study
Distinguishing between sentences: We found
that magnitude estimation judgements are very good
at distinguishing sentences expressing the same con-
tent. Consider Table 2, which shows the average ac-
ceptability for the n-best formulation of each of the

ent but valid discourse marker

lation averages .89, the second best .57 and the worst

always select the most preferred type (a caused b)
for each of the 144 sentences, the average accept-
ability is only .12.

tion of each of the 144 sentences.
Testing hypotheses: In addition to distinguishing
between different formulations of a sentence, vary-
ing generation choices systematically allows us to
test any hypotheses we might have about their ef-
fect on acceptability. Indeed, hypothesis testing was
an important consideration in the design of this ex-
periment. For instance, various studies (Clark and
Clark, 1968; Katz and Brent, 1968; Irwin, 1980)
suggest that for older school children, college stu-
dents and adults, comprehension is better for the
cause-effect presentation, both when the relation is
implicit (no discourse marker) and explicit (with a
discourse marker). We can then test specific predic-
tions about which formulations are likely to be more
acceptable.
H1 We expect the cause-effect information order
to be deemed more acceptable than the corre-
sponding effect-cause information order.
H2 As all four discourse markers are commonly
used in language, we do not expect any par-
ticular marker to be globally preferred to the
others.
We ran a 4 (discourse marker) x 2 (information or-
der) repeated measures ANOVA. We found a main
effect of information order (F1(1, 49) = 5.19, p =
.017) and discourse marker (F1(3, 147) = 3.48, p
= .027). Further, we found a strong interaction be-
tween information order and formulation type, F1(3,
147) = 19.17, p<.001. We now discuss what these
results mean.
Understanding generation decisions: The main
effect of discourse marker was not predicted (Hy-
pothesis H2). We could try and explain this em-
pirically. For instance, in the BNC ?because? as
a conjunction occurs 741 times per million words,
while ?cause? as a verb occurs 180 times per mil-
lion words, ?because of? 140 per million words and
?cause? as a noun 86 per million words. We might
expect the more common markers to be judged more
acceptable. However, there was no significant corre-
lation between participants? preference for discourse
marker and the BNC corpus frequencies of the mark-
ers (Spearman?s rho=0.4, p>0.75). This suggests
that corpus frequencies need not be a reliable indica-
tor of reader preferences, at least for discourse con-
nectives. The mean z-scores for the four discourse
markers are presented in Table 3
To explore the interaction between discourse
marker and information order, a post-ANOVA
Tukey HSD analysis was performed. The significant

Table 3: Av. z-scores for the four discourse markers
effects are listed in Table 4. There is a significant
preference for using ?because? and ?because of? in
the effect-cause order (infix) over the cause-effect
order (prefix) and for using ?cause? as a verb in
the cause-effect order (active voice) over the effect-
cause order (passive voice). Thus, hypothesis H1
is not valid for ?because? and ?because of?, where
the canonical infix order is preferred, and though
there are numerical preferences for the cause-effect
order for ?cause? as a noun we found support for
hypothesis H1 to be significant only for ?cause? as a
verb. Table 4 also tells us that if the formulation is in
cause-effect order, there is a preference for ?cause?
as a verb over ?because? and ?because of?. On the
other hand, if the formulation is in the reverse effect-
cause order, there is a preference for ?because? or
?because of? over ?cause? as a verb or as a noun.
Summary: This evaluation provides us with some
insights into how generation decisions interact,
which can be used prescriptively to, for example, se-
lect a discourse marker, given a required information
order.
4.3 Results of sentence recall study
While magnitude estimation assessments of accept-
ability can be used to test some hypotheses about the
effect of generation decisions, it cannot really tease
apart cases where there are surface level disfluencies
from those that result in a breakdown in comprehen-
sion. To test such hypotheses, we use the sentence
recall study.
Testing hypotheses: Previous research (e.g., En-
gelkamp and Rummer (2002)) suggests that recall
for the second clause is worse when clauses are
combined through coordination (such as ?therefore?
or ?and?) than through subordination such as ?be-
cause?. The explanation is that subordination bet-
ter unifies the two clauses in immediate memory.
We would expect this unification to be even greater
when the cause and effect are arguments to a verb.
Thus, compared to ?because?, we would expect re-
call of the second clause to be higher for ?cause? as
a verb or a noun, due to the tighter syntactic binding
to the discourse marker (object of a verb). Likewise,
compared to ?cause?, we would expect to see more
recall errors for the second clause when using ?be-
cause? as a conjunction. Our hypotheses are listed
below:
H3 For ?cause? as a verb or a noun, there will be
fewer recall errors in ?a? and ?b? compared
to ?because? or ?because of?, because of the
tighter syntactic binding.
H4 For ?because? as a conjunction, there will be
more recall errors in the second clause than in
the first clause; i.e., for ?b because a?, clause
?a? will have more recall errors than ?b? and for
?because ab?, clause ?a? will have fewer recall
errors than ?b?.
Table 5 shows the average incidence of each error
type per sentences in that formulation (cf. Table 1).
Note that the totals per row might add up to slightly
more than 1 because multiple errors can be coded
for the same sentence.
Table 5 shows that ?because? and ?because of?
constructs result in more type 3 and 4 recall errors
in clauses ?a? and/or ?b? compared with ?cause? as
either a noun or a verb. This difference is significant
(z-test; p<.001), thus supporting hypothesis H3.
Further, for ?because?, the recall errors for the
first clause are significantly fewer than for the sec-
ond clause (z-test; p<.01), thus supporting hypoth-
esis H4. In contrast, for the cases with ?cause? as a
verb or noun, both A and B are arguments to a verb
(either ?cause? or a copula), and the tighter syntactic
binding helps unify them in immediate memory, re-
sulting in fewer recall errors that are also distributed
more evenly between the first and the second argu-
ment to the verb.
We make one further observation: passive voice
sentences appear to be reformulated at substantial
levels (19%), but in a valid manner (type 1 errors).
This suggests that the dispreference for passives in
the acceptability study is about surface level form
rather than deeper comprehension. This would be a

reasonable conclusion, given that all our participants
are university students.
Summary: Overall we conclude that sentence re-
call studies provide insights into the nature of the
comprehension problems encountered, and they cor-
roborate acceptability ratings in general, and partic-
ularly so for longer sentences.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have tried to separate out surface
form aspects of acceptability from breakdowns in
comprehension, using two offline psycholinguistic
methods.
We believe that sentence recall methodologies can
substitute for task based evaluations and highlight
breakdowns in comprehension at the sentence level.
However, like most task based evaluations, recall ex-
periments are time consuming as they need to be
conducted in a supervised setting. Additionally, they
require manual annotation of error types, though
perhaps this could be automated.
Acceptability ratings on the other hand are easy to
acquire. Based on our experiments, we believe that
acceptability ratings are reliable indicators of com-
prehension for longer sentences and, particularly for
shorter sentences, combine surface form judgements
with ease of comprehension in a manner that is very
relevant for evaluating sentence generation or regen-
eration, including simplification.
Both methods are considerably easier to set up
and interpret than online methods such as self paced
reading, eye tracking or neurophysiological meth-
ods.
