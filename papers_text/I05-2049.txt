Abstract 
One of the most active and promising areas of 
statistical machine translation (SMT) research 
are tree-based SMT approaches. Tree-based 
SMT has the potential to overcome the 
weaknesses of early SMT architectures which (a) 
do not handle long-distance dependencies well, 
and (b) are underconstrained in that they allow 
too much flexibility in word reordering. 
In this tutorial, we will review the various 
possible approaches to tree-based SMT, ranging 
from the original Inversion Transduction 
Grammar (ITG) models to later models such as 
alignment templates, dependency models, tree-
to-string models, tree-to-tree models, and also 
probabilistic EBMT models. We will discuss the 
theoretical relationships between approaches, 
with critical analysis of their strengths and 
weaknesses. Within this framework we will 
survey the emerging comparative results from 
intriguing new large-scale empirical studies 
across various language pairs. We will consider 
what kind of constraints and biases can or 
should be imposed by models on the variation 
between unrelated human languages, and how 
this can facilitate efficient algorithms for a wide 
range of tasks in machine learning and 
processing of language. We will consider both 
scientific and engineering implications, and 
investigate the potential relationships to cross-
language universals. 
Biography 
Prof. Wu received his PhD in Computer Science 
from the University of California at Berkeley, 
and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University 
of Toronto (Ontario, Canada) prior to joining 
HKUST in 1992. He received a BS in Computer 
Engineering from the University of California at 
San Diego (Revelle College departmental award, 
cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1984 and an 
Executive MBA from Kellogg and HKUST in 
2002. He has been a visiting researcher at 
Columbia University in 1995-96, Bell 
Laboratories in 1995, and the Technische 
Universit?t M?nchen (Munich, Germany) during 
1986-87. Prof. Wu serves as Associate Editor of 
ACM Transactions on Speech and Language 
Processing, Machine Translation, Journal of 
Natural Language Engineering, and 
Communications of COLIPS. He has also served 
as Co-Chair for EMNLP-2004, on the Editorial 
Board of Computational Linguistics, the 
Organizing Committee of ACL-2000 and 
WVLC-5 (SIGDAT 1997), and the Executive 
Committee of the Association for Computational 
Linguistics (ACL).
