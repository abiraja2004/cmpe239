Abstract. This paper proposes a method for detecting errors concern-
ing article usage and singular/plural usage based on the mass count
distinction. Although the mass count distinction is particularly impor-
tant in detecting these errors, it has been pointed out that it is hard
to make heuristic rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns. To
solve the problem, first, instances of mass and count nouns are auto-
matically collected from a corpus exploiting surface information in the
proposed method. Then, words surrounding the mass (count) instances
are weighted based on their frequencies. Finally, the weighted words are
used for distinguishing mass and count nouns. After distinguishing mass
and count nouns, the above errors can be detected by some heuristic
rules. Experiments show that the proposed method distinguishes mass
and count nouns in the writing of Japanese learners of English with
an accuracy of 93% and that 65% of article errors are detected with a
precision of 70%.
1 Introduction
Although several researchers [1,2,3] have shown that heuristic rules are effective
to detecting grammatical errors in the English writing of second language learn-
ers, it has been pointed out that it is hard to write heuristic rules for detecting
article errors [1]. To be precise, it is hard to write heuristic rules for distinguish-
ing mass and count nouns which are particularly important in detecting article
errors. The major reason for this is that whether a noun is a mass noun or a
count noun greatly depends on its meaning or its surrounding context (Refer to
Pelletier and Schubert [4] for detailed discussion on the mass count distinction).
Article errors are very common among Japanese learners of English [1,5].
This is perhaps because the Japanese language does not have an article system
similar to that of English. Thus, it is favorable for error detecting systems aiming
at Japanese learners of English to be capable of detecting article errors. In other
words, such systems need to somehow distinguish mass and count nouns in the
writing of Japanese learners of English.

In view of this background, we propose a method for automatically dis-
tinguishing mass and count nouns in context to complement the conventional
heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors. In this method, mass and count
nouns are distinguished by words surrounding the target noun. Words surround-
ing the target noun are collected from a corpus and weighted based on their
occurrences. The weighted words are used for distinguishing mass and count
nouns in detecting article errors.
Given the mass count distinction, errors concerning singular/plural usage,
which are also common in the writing of Japanese learners of English, can be
detected as well as article errors. For example, given that the noun information
is a mass noun, informations can be detected as an error. Considering this, we
include errors concerning singular/plural usage in the target errors of this paper.
Hereafter, to keep the notation simple, the target errors1 will be referred to as
article errors.
The next section describes related work on distinguishing mass and count
nouns. Section 3 proposes the method for automatically distinguishing mass and
count nouns. Section 4 describes heuristic rules for detecting article errors based
on the mass count distinction given by the proposed method. Section 5 discusses
results of experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method.
2 Related Work
Several researchers have proposed methods for distinguishing mass and count
nouns in the past. Allan [6] has presented an approach to distinguishing nouns
that are used only as either mass or count based on countability environments.
This distinction is called countability preferences. Baldwin and Bond [7,8] have
proposed several methods for learning the countability preferences from cor-
pora2. Bond and Vatikitis-Bateson [9] have shown that nouns? countability can
be predicted using an ontology3. O?Hara et al [10] have proposed a method for
classifying mass and count nouns based on semantic information (Cyc ontological
types [11]).
Unfortunately, it is difficult to apply the above methods to complement
the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors. The meth-
ods [6,7,8,9] are not enough for the purpose, because the majority of nouns can
be used as both mass and count depending on the surrounding context [12].
The methods [9,10] cannot be readily applicable to the purpose because they
work only when semantic information on nouns is given. It would be difficult to
extract semantic information from nouns in the writing of learners of English.
1 The details of the target errors are shown in Sect. 4.
2 They define four way countability preferences: fully countable, uncountable, bipar-
tite, and plural only.
3 They define five way countability preferences: fully countable, strongly countable,
weakly countable, uncountable, and plural only.

3 Distinguishing Mass and Count Nouns
In the proposed method, decision lists [13] are used to distinguish mass and count
nouns. Generally, decision lists are learned from a set of manually tagged training
data. In the proposed method, however, training data can be automatically
generated from a raw corpus.
Section 3.1 describes how to generate training data. Section 3.2 describes how
to learn decision lists from the training data. Section 3.3 explains the method
for distinguishing mass and count nouns using the decision lists.
3.1 Generating Training Data
To generate training data, first, instances of the target noun that head their
noun phrase (NP) are collected from a corpus with their surrounding words.
This can be simply done by an existing chunker or parser.
Then, the collected instances are tagged with mass or count by tagging rules.
For example, the underlined chicken:
Example 1. ... are a lot of chickens in the roost ...
is tagged as
Example 2. ... are a lot of chickens/count in the roost ...
because it is in plural form.
We have made tagging rules based on linguistic knowledge [6,14,12]. Figure 1
and Table 1 represent the tagging rules. Figure 1 shows the framework of the tag-
ging rules. Eachnode in Fig. 1 represents a question applied to the instance in ques-
tion. For example, the root node reads ?Is the instance in question plural??. Each
leaf represents a result of the classification. For example, if the answer is ?yes? at the
root node, the instance in question is tagged with count. Otherwise, the question
at the lower node is applied and so on. The tagging rules do not classify instances
as mass or count in some cases. These unclassified instances are tagged with the
symbol ???. Unfortunately, they cannot readily be included in training data. For
simplicity of implementation, they are excluded from training data.

Fig. 1. Framework of the tagging rules
Note that the tagging rules can be used only for distinguishing mass and
count nouns in texts containing no errors. They cannot be used in the writing
of Japanese learners of English that may contain errors including article errors;
they are based on article and the distinction between singular and plural.
Finally, the tagged instances are stored in a file with their surrounding words.
Each line in the file consists of one of the tagged instances and its surrounding
words as shown in Example 2. The file is used as training data for learning a
decision list.
3.2 Learning Decision Lists
A decision list consists of a set of rules that are learned from training data. Each
rule matches with the template as follows:
If a condition is true, then a decision . (1)
To define the template in the proposed method, let us have a look at the
following two examples:
Example 3. I read the paper .
Example 4. The paper is made of hemp pulp.
The underlined papers in both sentences cannot simply be classified as mass or
count by the tagging rules presented in Sect. 3.1 because both are singular and
modified by the definite article. Nevertheless, we can tell that the former is a
count noun and that the latter is a mass noun from the contexts. This suggests
that the mass count distinction is often determined by words surrounding the
target noun. In Example 3, we can tell that the paper refers to something that
can be read from read , and therefore it is a count noun. Likewise, in Example 4,
the paper refers to a certain substance from made and pulp, and therefore it is
a mass noun.
Detecting Article Errors Based on the Mass Count Distinction 819
Taking this observation into account, we define the template based on words
surrounding the target noun. To formalize the template, we will use a random
variable MC that takes either mass or count to denote that the target noun is
a mass noun or a count noun, respectively. We will also use w and C to denote
a word and a certain context around the target noun, respectively. We define
three types of C: np, ?k, and +k that denote the contexts consisting of the noun
phrase that the target noun heads, k words to the left of the noun phrase, and
k words to its right, respectively. Then the template is formalized by
If a word w appears in the context C of the target noun,
then the target noun is distinguished as MC.
Hereafter, to keep the notation simple, the template is abbreviated to
wC ? MC. (2)
Now rules that match with the template can be learned from the training
data generated in Sect. 3.1. All we need to do is to collect words in C from the
training data. Here, the words in Table 1 are excluded. Also, function words
such as pronouns and auxiliary verbs, cardinal and quasi-cardinal numerals, and
the target noun are excluded. All words are reduced to their morphological stem
and converted entirely to lower case when collected. For example, the following
tagged instance:
Example 5. She ate a piece of fried chicken/mass for dinner.
would give a set of rules that match with the template:
Example 6.
piece
?3 ? mass, frynp ? mass, dinner+3 ? mass
for the target noun chicken being mass when k = 3.
In addition to the above rules, a default rule is defined. It is based on the
target noun itself and used when no other confident rules4 are found in the
decision list for the target noun. It is defined by
t ? MCmajor (3)
where t and MCmajor denote the target noun and the major case of MC in the
training data, respectively. Equation (3) reads ?If the target noun appears, then
it is distinguished as the major case?.
The log-likelihood ratio [15] decides in which order rules in a decision list are
applied to the target noun in novel context. It is defined by
log
p(MC|wC)
p(MC|wC)
(4)
4 Confidence is given by the log-likelihood ratio, which will be defined by (4).
820 R. Nagata et al
where MC is the exclusive event of MC and p(MC|wC) is the probability that
the target noun is used as MC when w appears in the context C. For the default
rule, the log-likelihood ratio is defined by
log
p(MCmajor|t)
p(MCmajor|t)
(5)
It is important to exercise some care in estimating p(MC|wC). In principle,
we could simply count the number of times that w appears in the context C of
the target noun used as MC in the training data. However, this estimate can be
unreliable, when w does not appear often in the context. To solve this problem,
using a smoothing parameter ? [16], p(MC|wC) is estimated by
p(MC|wC) =
f(wC , MC) + ?
f(wC) + m?
(6)
where f(wC) and f(wC , MC) are occurrences of w appearing in C and those in
C of the target noun used as MC, respectively. The constant m is the number
of possible classes, that is, m = 2 (mass or count) in our case, and introduced
to satisfy p(MC|wC) + p(MC|wC) = 1. In this paper, ? is set to 0.5. Likewise,
p(MCmajor|t) is estimated by
p(MCmajor|t) =
f(t, MCmajor) + ?
f(t) + m?
(7)
Rules in a decision list are sorted in descending order by (4) and (5). They are
tested on the target noun in novel context in this order. Rules sorted below the
default rule are discarded because they are never used as we will see in Sect. 3.3.
Table 2 shows part of a decision list for the target noun chicken that was
learned from a subset of the BNC (British National Corpus) [17]. Note that the
rules are divided into two columns for the purpose of illustration in Table 2; in
practice, they are merged into one just as shown in Table 3.
On one hand, we associate the words in the left half with food or cooking.
On the other hand, we associate those in the right half with animals. From
this observation, we can say that chicken is a count noun in the sense of an
animal but a mass noun when referring to food or cooking, which agrees with
the knowledge presented in previous work [18].

3.3 Distinguishing the Target Noun in Novel Context
To distinguish the target noun in novel context, each rule in the decision list
is tested on it in the sorted order until the first applicable one is found. It is
distinguished by the first applicable one. If two or more applicable rules (e.g.,
?piece
?3 ? mass? and ?count?3 ? count? in Table 3) are found, it is distin-
guished by the major decisions of the two or more applicable rules. For example,
suppose there are three applicable rules and two of them are for mass nouns
(one of them is for count nouns). In this case, the target noun is distinguished as
mass. Ties are broken by rules sorted below the ties. If ties include the default
rule, it is distinguished by the default rule.
The following is an example of distinguishing the target noun chicken. Sup-
pose that the decision list shown in Table 3 and the following sentence are given:
Example 7. I ate a piece of chicken with salad.
It turns out that the first rule ?piece3 ? mass? in Table 3 is applicable to the
instance. Thus, it is distinguished as a mass noun.
It should be noted that rules sorted below the default rule are never used
because the default rule is always applicable to the target noun. This is the
reason why rules sorted below the default rule are discarded as mentioned in
Sect. 3.2.
4 Heuristic Rules for Detecting Article Errors
So far, a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns has been described.
This section describes heuristic rules for detecting article errors based on the
mass count distinction given by the method.
Article errors are detected by the following three steps. Rules in each step
are examined on each target noun in the target text.
In the first step, any mass noun in plural form is detected as an article error.
If an article error is detected in the first step, the rest of the steps are not applied.
In the second step, article errors are detected by the rules described in Ta-
ble 4. The symbol ?? in Table 4 denotes that the combination of the corre-
sponding row and column is erroneous. For example, the third row denotes that

plural count nouns, singular mass nouns, and plural mass nouns that are mod-
ified by another , each, or one are erroneous. The symbol ??? denotes that no
error can be detected by the table. If one of the rules in Table 4 is applied to
the target noun, the third step is not applied.
In the third step, article errors are detected by the rules described in Table 5.
The symbols ?a?, ?the?, and ??? in Table 5 denote the indefinite article, the
definite article, and no article, respectively. The symbols ?? and ??? are the
same as in Table 4. For example, ?? in the third row and second column denotes
that the singular mass nouns modified by the indefinite article is erroneous.
In addition to the three steps, article errors are detected by exceptional rules.
The indefinite article that modifies other than the head noun is judged to be
erroneous (e.g., *an expensive). Likewise, the definite article that modifies other
than the head noun and adjectives is judged to be erroneous (e.g., *the them).
5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Conditions
A subset of essays5 written by Japanese learners of English were used as the
target texts in the experiments. The subset contained 30 essays (1747 words). A
native speaker of English who was a professional rewriter of English recognized
62 article errors in the subset.

Detecting Article Errors Based on the Mass Count Distinction 823
The British National Corpus (BNC) [17] was used to learn decision lists.
Spoken data were excluded from the corpus. Also, sentences the OAK system6,
which was used to extract NPs from the corpus, failed to analyze were excluded.
After these operations, the size of the corpus approximately amounted to 80
million words (the size of the original BNC is approximately 100 million words).
Hereafter, unless otherwise specified, the corpus will be referred to as the BNC.
Performance of the proposed method was evaluated by accuracy, recall, and
precision. Accuracy is defined by
No. of mass and count nouns distinguished correctly
No. of distinguished target nouns
. (8)
Namely, accuracy measures how accurately the proposed method distinguishes
mass and count nouns. Recall is defined by
No. of article errors detected correctly
No. of article errors in the target essays
. (9)
Recall measures how well the proposed method detects all the article errors in
the target essays. Precision is defined by
No. of article errors detected correctly
No. of detected article errors
. (10)
Precision measures how well the proposed method detects only the article errors
in the target essays.
5.2 Experimental Procedures
First, decision lists for each target noun in the target essays were learned from
the BNC. To extract noun phrases and their head nouns, the OAK system was
used7. An optimal value for k (window size of context) was estimated as follows.
For 23 nouns8 shown in [12] as examples of nouns used as both mass and count
nouns, accuracy was calculated using the BNC and ten-fold cross validation. As
a result of setting k = 3, 10, 50, it turned out that k = 3 maximized the average
accuracy. Following this result, k = 3 was selected in the experiments.
Second, the target nouns were distinguished whether they were mass or count
by the proposed method, and then article errors were detected by the mass
6 OAK System Homepage: http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/oak/
7 We evaluated how accurately training data can be generated by the tagging rules
using the OAK system. It turned out that the accuracy was 0.997 against 2903
instances of 23 nouns shown in [12] which were randomly selected from the BNC;
1694 of those were tagged with mass or count by the tagging rules and 1689 were
tagged correctly. The five errors were due to the OAK system.
8 In [12], 25 nouns are shown. Of those, two nouns (hate and spelling) were excluded
because they only appeared 12.1 and 15.6 times on average in the ten-fold cross
validation, respectively.
824 R. Nagata et al
count distinction and the heuristic rules described in Sect. 4. As a preprocessing,
spelling errors in the target essays were corrected using a spell checker.
Finally, the results of the detection were compared to those done by the
native-speaker of English. From the comparison, accuracy, recall, and precision
were calculated.
Comparison of performance of the proposed method to that of other meth-
ods is difficult because there is no generally accepted test set or performance
baseline [19]. Given this limitation, we compared performance of the proposed
method to that of Grammarian9, a commercial grammar checker. We also com-
pared it to that of a method that used only the default rules in the decision lists.
We tested them on the same target essays to measure their performances.
5.3 Experimental Results and Discussion
In the experiments, the proposed method distinguished mass and count nouns in
the target essays with accuracy of 0.93. This means that the proposed method
is effective to distinguishing mass and count nouns in the writing of Japanese
learners of English. From this result, we can say that the proposed method can
complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors.
Because of the high accuracy of the proposed method, it detected more than
half of the article errors in the target essays (Table 6). Of the undetected article
errors (22 out of 62), only four were due to the misclassification of mass and
count nouns by the proposed method. The rest were article errors that were not
detected even if the mass count distinction was given. For example, extra definite
articles such as ?I like *the gardening.? cannot be detected even if whether the
noun ?gardening? is a mass noun or a count noun is given. Therefore, it is
necessary to exploit other sources of information than the mass count distinction
to detect these kinds of article error. For instance, exploiting the relation between
sentences could be used to detect these kinds of article error.
The proposed method outperformed the method using only the default rules
in both recall and precision. This means that words surrounding the target nouns
are good indicators of the mass count distinction. For example, the proposed
method correctly distinguished the target noun place in the phrase beautiful
place as a count noun by ?beautifulnp ? count? and detected an article error
from it whereas the method using only the default rules did not.

In precision, the proposed method was outperformed by Grammarian; since
Grammarian is a commercial grammar checker, it seems to be precision-oriented.
The proposed method made 17 false-positives. Of the 17 false-positives, 13
were due to the misclassification of mass and count nouns by the proposed
method. Especially, the proposed method often made false-positives in idiomatic
phrases (e.g., by plane). This result implies that some methods for handling
idiomatic phrases may improve the performance. Four were due to the chun-
ker used to analyze the target essays. Since the chunker is designed for ana-
lyzing texts that contain no errors, it is possible that a chunker designed for
analyzing texts written by Japanese learners of English reduces this kind of
false-positive.
6 Conclusions
This paper has proposed a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns to
complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors.
The experiments have shown that the proposed method distinguishes mass and
count nouns with a high accuracy (0.93) and that the recall and precision are
0.65 and 0.70, respectively. From the results, it follows that the proposed method
can complement the conventional heuristic rules for detecting grammatical errors
in the writing of Japanese learners of English.
The experiments have also shown that approximately 35% of article errors
in the target essays are not detected by the mass count distinction. For future
work, we will study methods for detecting the undetected article errors.
