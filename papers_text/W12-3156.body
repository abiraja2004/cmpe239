Abstract
SMT typically models translation at the sen-
tence level, ignoring wider document context.
Does this hurt the consistency of translated
documents? Using a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem in various data conditions, we show that
SMT translates documents remarkably con-
sistently, even without document knowledge.
Nevertheless, translation inconsistencies often
indicate translation errors. However, unlike in
human translation, these errors are rarely due
to terminology inconsistency. They are more
often symptoms of deeper issues with SMT
models instead.
1 Introduction
While Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) mod-
els translation at the sentence level (Brown et al.,
1993), human translators work on larger translation
units. This is partly motivated by the importance
of producing consistent translations at the document
level. Consistency checking is part of the quality as-
surance process, and complying with the terminol-
ogy requirements of each task or client is crucial.
In fact, many automatic tools have been proposed to
assist humans in this important task (Itagaki et al.,
2007; Dagan and Church, 1994, among others).
This suggests that wider document-level context
information might benefit SMT models. However,
we do not have a clear picture of the impact of
sentence-based SMT on the translation of full doc-
uments. From a quality standpoint, it seems safe to
assume that translation consistency is as desirable
for SMT as for human translations. However, con-
sistency needs to be balanced with other quality re-
quirements. For instance, strict consistency might
result in awkward repetitions that make translations
less fluent. From a translation modeling standpoint,
while typical SMT systems do not explicitly enforce
translation consistency, they can learn lexical choice
preferences from training data in the right domain.
In this paper, we attempt to get a better under-
standing of SMT consistency. We conduct an em-
pirical analysis using a phrase-based SMT system in
a variety of experimental settings, focusing on two
simple, yet understudied, questions. Is SMT output
consistent at the document level? Do inconsistencies
indicate translation errors?
We will see that SMT consistency issues are quite
different from consistency issues in human transla-
tions. In fact, while inconsistency errors in SMT
output might be particularly obvious to the human
eye, SMT is globally about as consistent as human
translations. Furthermore, high translation consis-
tency does not guarantee quality: weaker SMT sys-
tems trained on less data translate more consistently
than stronger larger systems. Yet, inconsistent trans-
lations often indicate translation errors, possibly be-
cause words and phrases that translate inconsistently
are the hardest to translate.
After discussing related work on consistency and
document modeling for SMT (Section 2), we de-
scribe our corpora in Section 3 and our general
methodology in Section 4. In Section 5, we dis-
cuss the results of an automatic analysis of transla-
tion consistency, before turning to manual analysis
in Section 6.

2 Related work
While most SMT systems operate at the sentence
level, there is increased interest in modeling docu-
ment context and consistency in translation.
In earlier work (Carpuat, 2009), we investigate
whether the ?one sense per discourse? heuristic
commonly used in word sense disambiguation (Gale
et al., 1992) can be useful in translation. We show
that ?one translation per discourse? largely holds
in automatically word-aligned French-English news
stories, and that enforcing translation consistency as
a simple post-processing constraint can fix some of
the translation errors in a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem. Ture et al. (2012) provide further empirical
support by studying the consistency of translation
rules used by a hierarchical phrase-based system to
force-decode Arabic-English news documents from
the NIST evaluation.
Several recent contributions integrate translation
consistency models in SMT using a two-pass de-
coding approach. In phrase-based SMT, Xiao et
al. (2011) show that enforcing translation consis-
tency using post-processing and redecoding tech-
niques similar to those introduced in Carpuat (2009)
can improve the BLEU score of a Chinese-English
system. Ture et al. (2012) also show signifi-
cant BLEU improvements on Arabic-English and
Chinese-English hierarchical SMT systems. Dur-
ing the second decoding pass, Xiao et al. (2011)
use only translation frequencies from the first pass
to encourage consistency, while Ture et al. (2012)
also model word rareness by adapting term weight-
ing techniques from information retrieval.
Another line of work focuses on cache-based
adaptive models (Tiedemann, 2010a; Gong et al.,
2011), which lets lexical choice in a sentence be in-
formed by translations of previous sentences. How-
ever, cache-based models are sensitive to error prop-
agation and can have a negative impact on some data
sets (Tiedemann, 2010b). Moreover, this approach
blurs the line between consistency and domain mod-
eling. In fact, Gong et al. (2011) reports statistically
significant improvements in BLEU only when com-
bining pure consistency caches with topic and simi-
larity caches, which do not enforce consistency but
essentially perform domain or topic adaptation.
There is also work that indirectly addresses con-
sistency, by encouraging the re-use of translation
memory matches (Ma et al., 2011), or by using a
graph-based representation of the test set to promote
similar translations for similar sentences (Alexan-
drescu and Kirchhoff, 2009).
All these results suggest that consistency can be
a useful learning bias to improve overall translation
quality, as measured by BLEU score. However, they
do not yet give a clear picture of the translation con-
sistency issues faced by SMT systems. In this paper,
we directly check assumptions on SMT consistency
in a systematic analysis of a strong phrase-based
system in several large data conditions.
3 Translation Tasks
We use PORTAGE, the NRC?s state-of-the-art
phrase-based SMT system (Foster et al., 2009), in a
number of settings. We consider different language
pairs, translation directions, training sets of differ-
ent nature, domain and sizes. Dataset statistics are
summarized in Table 1, and a description follows.
Parliament condition These conditions are de-
signed to illustrate an ideal situation: a SMT system
trained on large high-quality in-domain data.
The training set consists of Canadian parliamen-
tary text, approximately 160 million words in each
language (Foster et al., 2010). The test set also
consists of documents from the Canadian parlia-
ment: 807 English and 476 French documents. Each
document contains transcript of speech by a single
person, typically focusing on a single topic. The
source-language documents are relatively short: the
largest has 1079 words, the average being 116 words
for English documents, 124 for French. For each
document, we have two translations in the other lan-
guage: the first is our SMT output; the second is a
postedited version of that output, produced by trans-
lators of the Canadian Parliamentary Translation and
Interpretation services.
Web condition This condition illustrates a per-
haps more realistic situation: a ?generic? SMT sys-
tem, trained on large quantities of heterogeneous
data, used to translate slightly out-of-domain text.
The SMT system is trained on a massive corpus
of documents harvested from the Canadian federal
government?s Web domain ?gc.ca?: close to 40M

unique English-French sentence pairs. The test set
comes from a different source to guarantee that there
is no overlap with the training data. It consists of
more than 3000 English documents from a Canadian
provincial government organization, totalling 336k
words. Reference translations into French were pro-
duced by professional translators (not postedited).
Documents are quite small, each typically focus-
ing on a specific topic over a varied range of do-
mains: agriculture, environment, finance, human re-
sources, public services, education, social develop-
ment, health, tourism, etc.
NIST conditions These conditions illustrate the
situation with a very different language pair,
Chinese-to-English, under two different scenarios:
a system built using small in-domain data and one
using large more heterogeneous data.
Following Chen et al. (2012), in the Small data
condition, the SMT system is trained using the FBIS
Chinese-English corpus (10.5M target words); the
Large data condition uses all the allowed bilingual
corpora from NIST Open Machine Translation Eval-
uation 2009 (MT09), except the UN, Hong Kong
Laws and Hong Kong Hansard datasets, for a total
of 62.6M target words. Each system is then used
to translate 109 Chinese documents from the 2008
NIST evaluations (MT08) test set. For this dataset,
we have access to four different reference transla-
tions. The documents are longer on average than
for the previous conditions, with approximately 470
words per document.
4 Consistency Analysis Method
We study repeated phrases, which we define as a
pair ?p, d? where d is a document and p a phrase
type that occurs more than once in d.
Since this study focuses on SMT lexical choice
consistency, we base our analysis on the actual trans-
lation lexicon used by our phrase-based translation
system (i.e., its phrase-table.) For each document
d in a given collection of documents, we identify
all source phrases p from the SMT phrase-table that
occur more than once. We only consider source
phrases that contain at least one content word.
We then collect the set of translations T for each
occurrence of the repeated phrase in d. Using the
word-alignment between source and translation, for
each occurrence of p in d, we check whether p is
aligned to one of its translation candidates in the
phrase-table. A repeated phrase is translated consis-
tently if all the strings in T are identical ? ignoring
differences due to punctuation and stopwords.
The word-alignment is given by the SMT decoder
in SMT output, and is automatically infered from
standard IBM models for the reference1.
Note that, by design, this approach introduces a
bias toward components of the SMT system. A hu-
man annotator asked to identify translation incon-
sistencies in the same data would not tag the exact
same set of instances. Our approach might detect
translation inconsistencies that a human would not
annotate, because of alignment noise or negligible
variation in translations for instance. We address
these limitations in Section 6. Conversely, a human
annotator would be able to identify inconsistencies
for phrases that are not in the phrase-table vocabu-
lary. Our approach is not designed to detect these in-
consistencies, since we focus on understanding lex-
ical choice inconsistencies based on the knowledge
available to our SMT system at translation time.
1We considered using forced decoding to align the reference
to the source, but lack of coverage led us to use IBM-style word
alignment instead.

See Section 5 for details
5 Automatic Analysis
Table 2 reports various statistics for the translations
of repeated phrases in SMT and human references,
for all tasks described in Section 3.
5.1 Global SMT consistency
First, we observe that SMT is remarkably consis-
tent. This suggests that consistency in the source-
side local context is sufficient to constrain the SMT
phrase-table and language model to produce consis-
tent translations for most of the phrases considered
in our experiments.
The column ?consistent (%)? in Table 2 shows
that the majority of repeated phrases are translated
consistently for all translation tasks considered. For
French-English tasks, the percentage of repeated
phrases ranges from 73 to 89% . The consistency
percentages are lower for Chinese-English, a more
distant language pair. The Parliament task shows
that translating into the morphologically richer lan-
guage yields slightly lower consistency, all other di-
mensions being identical. However, morphological
variations only explain part of the difference: trans-
lating into French under the Web condition yields the
highest consistency percentage of all tasks, which
might be explained by the very short and repetitive
nature of the documents. As can be expected, incon-
sistently translated phrases are repeated in a docu-
ment more often than average for all tasks (columns
?avg within doc freq?).
Interestingly, the smaller and weaker Chinese-
English translation system (23.6 BLEU) is more
consistent than its stronger counterpart (27.2
BLEU) according to the consistency percent-
ages.The smaller training condition yields a smaller
phrase-table with a lower coverage of the nist08
source, fewer translation alternatives and there-
fore more consistent translations. Clearly consis-
tency does not correlate with translation quality, and
global consistency rates are not indicators of the
translation quality of particular system.
5.2 Consistency of reference translations
Surprisingly, the percentage of consistently trans-
lated phrases are very close in SMT output and hu-
man references, and even higher in SMT for 2 out of
5 tasks (Table 2).
Note that there are fewer instances of repeated
phrases for human references than for SMT, because
the phrase-table used as a translation lexicon natu-
rally covers SMT output better than independently
produced human translations. Word alignment is
also noisier between source and reference.

Table 3: Statistics on the translation consistency of repeated phrases in the multiple human references available on the
Chinese-English NIST08 test set. See Section 5 for details
There is a much wider gap in coherence per-
centages between references and SMT for Chinese-
English than French-English tasks, as can be ex-
pected for the harder language pair. In addition,
the same nist08 reference translations are more con-
sistent according to the phrase-table learned in the
small training condition than according to the larger
phrase-table. This confirms that consistency can sig-
nal a lack of coverage for new contexts.
5.3 Consistency and correctness
While translation consistency is generally assumed
to be desirable, it does not guarantee correctness:
SMT translations of repeated phrases can be consis-
tent and incorrect, or inconsistent and correct. In or-
der to evaluate correctness automatically, we check
whether translations of repeated phrases are found
in the corresponding reference sentences. This is
an approximation since the translation of a source
phrase can be correct even if it is not found in the
reference, and a target phrase found in the refer-
ence sentence is not necessarily a correct translation
of the source phrase considered. Post-edited refer-
ences alleviate some approximation errors for the
Parliament tasks: if the translated phrase matches
the references, it means that it was considered cor-
rect by the human post-editor who left it in. How-
ever, phrases modified during post-edition are not
necessarily incorrect. We will address this approxi-
mation in Section 6.
The columns ?% consistent that match reference?
and ?% inconsistent that match reference? in Ta-
ble 2 show that consistently translated phrases match
the references more often than the inconsistent ones.
With the post-edited references in the Parliament
condition, a non-negligible percentage of consis-
tently translated phrases are wrong: 17% when
translating into English, and 30% when translating
into French. In contrast, inconsistently translated
phrases are more likely to be incorrect: more than
65% into French and 47% into English. For all other
tasks, fewer translations match the references since
the references are not produced by post-edition, but
we still observe the same trend as in the Parliament
condition: inconsistent translations are more likely
to be incorrect than consistent translations overall.
Four reference translations are available for the
Chinese-English nist08 test set. We only use the first
one as a reference translation (in order to minimize
setting variations with French-English conditions.)
The three remaining human translations are used dif-
ferently. We compare them against the reference, ex-
actly as we do for SMT output. The resulting statis-
tics are given in Table 3. Since we know that the
human translations are correct, this shows that many
correct translations are not identified when using our
simple match technique to check correctness. How-
ever, it is interesting to note that (1) consistent hu-
man translations tend to match the human references
more often than the inconsistent ones, and (2) incon-
sistent MT translations match references much less
often than inconsistent human references.

Table 4: False positives in the automatic identification of

What goes wrong when inconsistent translations
are incorrect? This question is hard to answer with
automatic analysis only. As a first approximation,
we check whether we could correct translations by
replacing them with machine translations produced
elsewhere in the document. In Table 2, we refer to
this as ?easy fixes? and show that only very few in-
consistency errors can be corrected this way. These
errors are therefore unlikely to be fixed by post-
processing approaches that enforce hard consistency
constraints (Carpuat, 2009).
6 Manual Analysis
In order to better understand what goes wrong with
inconsistent translations, we conduct a manual anal-
ysis of these errors in the Parliament test condition
(see Table 1). We randomly sample inconsistently
translated phrases, and examine a total of 174 re-
peated phrases (?p, d? pairs, as defined in Section 4.)
6.1 Methodological Issues
We first try to quantify the limitations of our ap-
proach, and verify whether the inconsistencies de-
tected automatically are indeed real inconsistencies.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4.
Given the set of translations for a repeated phrase,
we ask questions relating to morphology and auto-
matic word-level alignment:
Morphology Are some of the alternate transla-
tions for phrase p only different inflections of the
same lemma? Assuming that inflectional morphol-
ogy is governed by language-internal considerations
more often than translational constraints, it is prob-
ably inaccurate to label morphological variations of
the same word as inconsistencies. The annotations
reveal that this only happens for 16% of our sam-
ple (column ?Same lemma? in Table 4). Work is
under way to build an accurate French lemmatizer
to automatically abstract away from morphological
variations.
Alignment Are some of the alternate translations
only a by-product of word alignment errors? This
happens for instance when the French word partis
is identified as being translated in English some-
times as parties and sometimes as political in the
same document: the apparent inconsistency is ac-
tually due to an incorrect alignment within the fre-
quent phrase political parties. We identify 19% of
word alignment issues in our manually annotated
sample (column ?Misaligned? in Table 4). While
it is clear that alignment errors should be avoided,
it is worth noting that such errors are sometimes in-
dicative of translation problems: this happens, for
instance, when a key content word is left untrans-
lated by the SMT system.
Overall, this analysis confirms that, despite the
approximations used, a majority of the examples de-
tected by our method are real inconsistencies.
6.2 Analysis of Translation Errors
We then directly evaluate translation accuracy in our
sample by checking whether the system translation
match the post-edited references. Here we focus our
attention on those 112 examples from our sample of
inconsistently translated phrases that do not suffer
from lemmatization or misalignment problems. For
comparison, we also analyze 200 randomly sampled
examples of consistently translated phrases. Note
that the identification of consistent phrases is not
subject to alignment and lemmatization problems,
which we therefore ignore in this case. Details of
this analysis can be found in Table 5.
We first note that 40% of all inconsistently trans-
lated phrase types were not postedited at all: their
translation can therefore be considered correct. In
the case of consistently translated phrases, the rate
of unedited translations rises to 75%.
Focusing now on those phrases whose translation
was postedited, we classify each in one of three
broad categories of MT errors: meaning, terminol-
ogy, and style/syntax errors (columns labeled ?Type
of Correction? in Table 5).
Terminology Errors Surprisingly, among the in-
consistently translated phrases, we find only 13%
of true terminological consistency errors, where

Table 5: Manual Classification of Posteditor Corrections on the Parliament Task
the SMT output is acceptable but different from
standard terminology in the test domain. For in-
stance, the French term personnes handicape?es can
be translated as either persons with disabilities or
people with disabilities, but the former is prefered
in the Parliament domain. In the case of consis-
tently translated phrases, no such errors were de-
tected. This contrasts with human translation, where
enforcing term consistency is a major concern. In
the large-data in-domain condition considered here,
SMT mostly translates terminology consistently and
correctly. It remains to be seen whether this still
holds when translating out-of-domain, or for differ-
ent genres of documents.
Meaning Errors Meaning errors occur when the
SMT output fails to convey the meaning of the
source phrase. For example, in a medical con-
text, our MT system sometimes translates the French
word examen into English as review instead of the
correct test or investigation. Such errors make up
24% of all corrections on inconsistently translated
phrases, 16% in the case of consistent translations.
Style/Syntax Errors By far the most frequent cat-
egory turns out to be style/syntax errors (70% of cor-
rections on inconsistently translated phrases, 84%
on consistently translated phrases): these are situ-
ations where the SMT output preserves the mean-
ing of the source phrase, but is still post-edited for
syntactic or stylistic preference. This category actu-
ally covers a wide range of corrections. The more
benign cases are more cosmetic in nature, for ex-
ample when the posteditor changes the MT output
?In terms of the cost associated with...? into ?With
regard to spending related to...?. In the more se-
vere cases, the posteditor completely rewrites a seri-
ously disfluent machine translation. However, errors
to which we have assigned this label have a com-
mon denominator: the inconsistent phrase that is the
focus of our attention is not the source of the er-
ror, but rather ?collateral damage? in the war against
mediocre translations.
Taken together, these results show that transla-
tion inconsistencies in SMT tend to be symptoms of
generic SMT problems such as meaning and fluency
or syntax errors. Only a minority of observed in-
consistencies turn out to be the type of terminology
inconsistencies that are a concern in human transla-
tions.
7 Conclusion
We have presented an in-depth study of machine
translation consistency, using state-of-the-art SMT
systems trained and evaluated under various realis-
tic conditions. Our analysis highlights a number of
important, and perhaps overlooked, issues regarding
SMT consistency.
First, SMT systems translate documents remark-
ably consistently, even without explicit knowledge
of extra-sentential context. They even exhibit global
consistency levels comparable to that of professional
human translators.
Second, high translation consistency does not cor-
relate with better quality: as can be expected in
phrase-based SMT, weaker systems trained on less
data produce translations that are more consistent
than higher-quality systems trained on larger more
heterogeneous data sets.
However, this does not imply that inconsistencies
are good either: inconsistently translated phrases co-
incide with translation errors much more often than
consistent ones. In practice, translation inconsis-
tency could therefore be used to detect words and
phrases that are hard to translate for a given system.
Finally, manual inspection of inconsistent transla-
448
tions shows that only a small minority of errors are
the kind of terminology problems that are the main
concern in human translations. Instead, the major-
ity of errors highlighted by inconsistent translations
are symptoms of other problems, notably incorrect
meaning translation, and syntactic or stylistic issues.
These problems are just as prevalent with consistent
as with inconsistent translations.
While directly enforcing translation consistency
in MT may prove useful in some situations, our
analysis suggests that the phrase-based SMT sys-
tems considered here would benefit more from di-
rectly tackling the underlying ?- and admittedly
more complex ? problems of meaning and syntac-
tic errors.
In future work, we plan to improve our analysis by
