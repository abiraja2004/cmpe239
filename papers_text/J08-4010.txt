Erratum
In Section 5 of the article ?Dependency Parsing of Turkish? by Gu?ls?en Eryig?it, Joakim
Nivre, and Kemal Oflazer (September 2008, Vol. 34, No. 3: 357?389), some abbreviations
were misinterpreted during the copyediting process.
The third sentence of Section 5.2 should be as follows: ?We use an unlexicalized
feature model where the parser uses only the minor part-of-speech category (as POS)
and dependency type of tokens (as DEP) and compare the results with the probabilistic
parser.?
The first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 5.2.1 should start as follows:
?We take the minor part-of-speech category. . . .?
The ?POS? abbreviation used on page 20 should be read as ?minor part-of-
speech,? and the ?POS? abbreviations on pages 21, 26, 27, and 28 should be read as
?part-of-speech.?
