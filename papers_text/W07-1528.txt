Abstract
We propose a new XML format for repre-
senting interlinearized glossed text (IGT),
particularly in the context of the documen-
tation and description of endangered lan-
guages. The proposed representation, which
we call IGT-XML, builds on previous mod-
els but provides a more loosely coupled and
flexible representation of different annota-
tion layers. Designed to accommodate both
selective manual reannotation of individual
layers and semi-automatic extension of an-
notation, IGT-XML is a first step toward par-
tial automation of the production of IGT.
1 Introduction
Much previous work on linguistic annotation has
necessarily focused on resource-rich languages, as it
is these languages for which we have large corpora
in need of linguistic annotation. In contrast, devel-
opment of annotation schemata and methodologies
to be used with language data from endangered lan-
guages has been left largely to individual documen-
tary and/or descriptive linguists working with partic-
ular languages.
This paper addresses linguistic annotation in the
context of the documentation and description of
endangered languages. One interesting feature of
language documentation projects is that, while the
languages studied differ widely, there is a quasi-
standard for presenting the material, in the form of
interlinearized glossed text (IGT). IGT typically
comprises at least four levels: (1) the original text,
(2) a separation of the original text into individual
morphemes, (3) a detailed morpheme-by-morpheme
gloss, and (4) a free translation of each sentence.
Another characteristic of language documentation
projects is the tentative nature of many analyses,
given that linguistic analysis is often occurring in
tandem with the annotation process, sometimes for
the first time in the recorded history of the language.
Furthermore, language documentation projects re-
quire long-term accessibility of the collected lan-
guage data as well as easy accessibility to commu-
nity members as well as to linguists.
In this paper we propose a new XML format for
representing IGT, which we call IGT-XML. We
build on the model of Hughes et al(2003) (the BHB
model from now on), who first proposed using the
IGT structure directly as a basis for an XML format.
While their format shows closely integrated annota-
tion layers using XML embedding, our model has
a more loosely coupled and flexible representation
of different annotation layers, to accommodate (a)
selective manual reannotation of individual layers,
and (b) the (semi-)automatic extension of annota-
tion, without the format posing an a priori restriction
on the annotation levels that can be added. The IGT-
XML representation is thus a first step toward par-
tial automation of the production of IGT, which in
turn is part of a larger project using techniques from
machine learning and natural language processing to
significantly reduce the time and money required to
produce annotated texts.
Besides the BHB model, we build on the Open
Languages Archiving Community (OLAC)1 meta-
data standard. OLAC is developing best practice
guidelines for archiving language resources digi-
tally, including a list of metadata entries to record
1http://www.language-archives.org

with language data.
Plan of the paper. After discussing interlin-
earized glosses in Section 2, we show the BHB
model and corresponding XML format in Section 3.
Section 4 presents the IGT-XML format that we pro-
pose. Section 5 demonstrates the applicability of
IGT-XML to data from different languages and dif-
ferent documentation projects, and Section 6 con-
cludes.
2 Interlinearized glossed text
IGT is a way of encoding linguistic data commonly
used to present linguistic examples. The example
below is a segment of IGT taken from Kuhn and
Mateo-Toledo (2004). The language is Q?anjob?al,
a Mayan language of Guatemala.

The format of the IGT in this example is typical of
the presentation of individual examples in the lin-
guistics literature. The raw, unannotated text (1) is
associated with three layers of annotation, shown in
(2). The first annotation layer shows the same text
with each word segmented into its constituent mor-
phemes. The next layer, the gloss layer, is a combi-
nation of English translations of the Q?anjob?al lem-
mas and tags representing the linguistic information
encoded by affixes on the lemmas. The third layer is
an English translation.
IGT formats vary more widely in language doc-
umentation, where IGT is typically the product of
linguistic analysis of texts transcribed from audio or
audiovisual recordings. A broad survey of formats
for interlinear texts (Bow et al, 2003) found vari-
ation in the number of rows, the type of analysis
found in each row, as well as the level of granularity
of analysis in each row.3
2KEY: ABS=abstract, COM=completive, CL=classifier,
DEM=demonstrative, E=ergative, EV=evidential, S=singular,
3=third person
3Hughes et al(2003) also discuss variation in presentational
factors, which we choose not to encode in our XML format.
Tools using IGT Shoebox/Toolbox4 (Shoebox in
following text) is a system that is widely used in doc-
umentary linguistics for storing and managing lan-
guage data. It provides facilities for lexicon man-
agement as well as text interlinearization.
Figure 1 shows one sentence of Q?anjob?al IGT in
the Shoebox output format.5 Shoebox exports texts
as plain text files. The different annotation layers
are marked by labels at the beginning of the line.
For example, in Figure 1 the label \tx marks the
original text and the line starting with \dm contains
its morphological segmentation.
One important test case for any XML format for
IGT is whether it can represent existing IGT data.
As Shoebox is a widely used tool, we take the
Shoebox data format as a representative case study.
Specifically, in Section 5 we show how texts from
two different languages, interlinearized using Shoe-
box and represented in the Shoebox output format,
can be encoded in IGT-XML.
In this paper we focus on the question of repre-
sentation rather than format transformation. Each
system managing IGT data will have different out-
put formats, requiring different techniques for trans-
forming the data to XML. The aim of this paper is
simply to describe and demonstrate the IGT-XML
format; a detailed automatic transformation method
mapping other formats to IGT-XML is beyond the
scope of this paper and will be addressed separately.
3 Previous work
This section discusses previous work on representa-
tion formats and specifically XML formats for inter-
linear text.
The BHB model: four levels of interlinear text.
Building on Bow et al?s (2003) analysis of differ-
ent IGT formats used in the literature, Hughes et
al. (2003) propose a four-level hierarchical model
for representing interlinear text. The four levels en-
code elements common to most instances of IGT:
text, phrase, word, and morpheme. One text may
consist of several individual phrases. A phrase con-
sists of one or more words, each of which consists

of one or more morphemes. To make this more con-
crete, the example in (1) shows a single phrase (or a
one-phrase text). The three annotation layers in (2)
are situated at different levels in the hierarchy: The
first and second annotation layers are both situated
at the morpheme level, showing a separation of the
original phrase into its constituent morphemes and
a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss, respectively. The
third annotation layer, the translation, is again situ-
ated at the phrase level, like the original text in (1).
The BHB model was originally developed in the
context of the EMELD project,6 which has focused
on advancing the state of technologies, data repre-
sentation formats, and methodologies for digital lan-
guage documentation.
The BHB XML format. Figure 2 shows an exam-
ple of the BHB XML format, which articulates the
four nested levels of structure of the BHB model.
It directly expresses the hierarchy of annotation lev-
els in a nested XML structure, in which, for exam-
ple, <morph> elements representing morphemes
are embedded in <word> elements representing
the corresponding words. The model maintains
the link between the source text morpheme and
the morpheme-level gloss annotation by embedding
both as <item> elements within the <morph>
and distinguishing the two by an attribute called
type.
While this representation provides the needed link
between morphemes and their glosses, it is rather in-
flexible because it is not modular: To add an addi-
tional annotation layer at the word level, one would
need to access and change the representation of each
word of each phrase. In this way, the BHBXML for-
mat is not ideally suited for an extensible annotation
that would need to add additional layers of linguistic
information in a flexible way.

4 IGT-XML
In this section we propose a new XML representa-
tion for IGT, IGT-XML. Like the BHB XML for-
mat, it is based on the BHB four-level model, but
it modularizes annotation levels. Linking between
annotation levels is achieved via unique IDs.
The IGT-XML format.
Figure 3 illustrates the new IGT-XML format, show-
ing a representation of the Q?anjob?al example of
Figure 1, mostly restricted to a single word, tyem-
pohal, for simplicity.
The IGT-XML format contains (at least) three
main components:
? a plaintext component comprising phrases as
well as the individual words making up each
phrase, encased in the <phrases> XML el-
ement,
? a morpheme component giving a morphologi-
cal analysis of the source text, encased in the
<morphemes> XML element, and
? a gloss component including glosses at both the
phrase and the word level.
Further annotation layers can be added by extend-
ing the format with additional components beyond
these three, which describe the core four levels of
interlinear text.
Within the <phrases> block, each individual
phrase is encased in a <phrase> element, which
includes the plain text within the <plaintext>
element as well as each individual word of the plain
text in a <word> element. Each <phrase> and
each <word> has a globally unique ID, assigned
in an id attribute. We choose to give explicit IDs
to words, rather than rely on character offsets, to
avoid possible problems with character encodings
and mis-represented special characters.
The morphemes in the<morphemes> block are
again organized by<phrase>. Each<phrase>
in the <morphemes> block refers to the corre-
sponding phrase in the <phrases> block by that
phrase?s unique ID.
Each individual morpheme, represented by a
<morph> element, refers to the unique ID corre-
sponding to the word of which it is a part. The lin-
ear order of morphemes belonging to the same word
is reflected in the order in which <morph> ele-
ments appear, as well as in the running id of the
morphemes. Morphemes have id attributes of their
own such that further annotation levels can refer to
the morphological segmentation of the source text,
as is the case for the morpheme-by-morpheme gloss
in the example in (2).
Whole-sentence glosses are collected in the
<translations> block, while word-by-word
glosses reside in the <gloss> block. Again,
glosses are organized by <phrase>, linked to the
original phrases by idref attributes. The glosses
in <gloss> refer to individual morphemes, hence
their idref attributes point to id attributes of the
<morphemes> block.
Metadata information in the file header
As suggested in Figure 3, IGT-XML is easily ex-
tended with metadata for each text. We adopt the
OLAC metadata set which uses the fifteen elements
defined in the Dublin Core metadata standard (Bird
and Simons, 2003a; Bird and Simons, 2001). These
elements provide a framework for specifying key in-
formation such as annotators, format, and language
of the text. In addition, the OLAC standard incorpo-
rates a number of qualifiers specific to the language-
resource community, such as discourse types (story,
conversation, etc.) and linguistic data types (lexi-
con, language description, primary text, etc.), and a
process for adopting further extensions.
In addition to the metadata block at the head of the
document, it would be possible to intersperse addi-
tional metadata blocks throughout the document, if
for example we wanted to indicate change of speaker
from one phrase to another in recorded conversation.
Discussion
Feature overview. The IGT-XML format we have
presented groups annotation into blocks in a mod-
ular fashion. Each block represents an annotation
layer. The format uses globally unique IDs (via
id and idref attributes) rather than XML em-
bedding for linking annotation layers. In particular,
<morph> and <word> annotation is kept sepa-
rate, such that additional layers of annotation at the
word and morpheme levels can be added modularly
without interfering with each other.
In its minimal form, the format has three blocks,

for phrases, morphemes, and glosses, but it is exten-
sible by further blocks, for example for POS-tags. It
is also possible to have different types of annotation
at the same linguistic level, for example manually
created as well as automatically assigned POS-tags.
Mildly standoff annotation. The IGT-XML for-
mat keeps the plain text separate from all levels of
annotation. However, it is not standoff in the strict
sense of having all annotation levels refer to the
plain text only and never to one another. The rea-
son for this is that there is no clear ?basic? level to
which all other annotation could refer.
One obvious candidate is the plain text, but the
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss refers not to words,
but to the morpheme segmentation of the source
text, as can be seen in example (2). This makes the
morpheme-segmented source text another candidate
for the basic level, but it is not guaranteed that this
level of annotation will always be available. At the
start of the annotation process the documentary lin-
guist likely has a transcription and a translation, but
he or she may or may not have determined the mor-
photactics of the language or even how to identify
word boundaries.
So, in order (a) not to commit the annotator to one
single order of annotation, or the presence of any
particular annotation level besides the plain text, and
(b) to allow annotation to refer to each of the levels
identified in the BHB model ? text, phrase, word,
and morpheme ?, we allow annotation levels to refer
to each other via unique IDs.
Requirements for IGT formats. Given the nature
of language documentation projects and IGT data,
an IGT representation format should (1) support
long term archiving of language data (Bird and Si-
mons, 2003b), which requires platform-independent
encoding, and it should (2) support a range of for-
mats. IGT data from different sources may show
differences in format and in what is annotated (Bow
et al, 2003), and may be produced using different
software systems. (3) It should be possible to add
or exchange layers of annotation in a modular fash-
ion. This is important because linguistic analysis
in language documentation, which typically targets
languages that are not well-studied, is often tenta-
tive and subject to change. This will also become
increasingly important with the use of automation
to aid and speed up language documentation: Au-
tomation techniques will typically target individual
annotation layers, and it is desirable to be able to
exchange automatic analysis tools freely.
Point (1), platform independence, is achieved by
almost any XML format, since XML formats are
plain text-based and mostly human-readable. Point
(2), the coverage of IGT formats in all variants, can
be achieved by adoption of the BHB model. Flexi-
bility and modularity (point (3)) are the main moti-
vations in the introduction of IGT-XML.
Beyond word-level annotation. For now the an-
notation focus in language documentation projects
is mostly on the word level, especially on morphol-
ogy and POS-tags. For annotation at the syntactic
level, it is an open question what the features of a
universally applicable annotation format should be.
At the moment, TIGER XML (Mengel and Lezius,
2000), with its capability to represent discontinuous
constituents, and constituent as well as dependency
information, seems like a good candidate. Syntac-
tic information could be represented in a separate
top-level XML element, linking tree terminals to
<word> elements by their ID attributes.
5 Data
An important goal of this research is to develop an
XML format which will be viable for use in the
broadest possible range of language documentation
contexts. To that end, the format needs to stretch
and morph with the needs and desires of the individ-
ual user. This section discusses some issues arising
from actual use of the format. The points are illus-
trated with pieces of the XML representation rather
than complete XML documents.
IGT-XML has been used to encode portions of
texts from the Mayan language Q?anjob?al and the
Mixe-Zoquean language Soteapanec (more com-
monly known as Sierra Popoluca). Q?anjob?al is
spoken primarily in the northwestern regions of
Guatemala, and Soteapanec is spoken in the south-
ern part of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Both texts
come from ongoing documentation efforts, and both
were first interlinearized using Shoebox.
181
5.1 Q?anjob?al
Figure 1 shows a Q?anjob?al sentence in the Shoe-
box export format. The annotation comprises origi-
nal text (\tx level), morphological analysis (\dm),
morpheme gloss (\ge), and parts of speech (\cp).
The Q?anjob?al texts we received preserve links be-
tween Shoebox annotation layers only through typo-
graphical alignment. The IGT-XML representation
makes these links explicit through global IDs using
id and idref attributes. It also splits off punctua-
tion, treating punctuation marks as separate words:
<word id="T1.P2.W5" text="tyempohal"/>
<word id="T1.P2.W6" text=","/>
<word id="T1.P2.W7" text="ayin"/>
In the part of speech annotation level (line \cp),
the annotator has additionally marked prefixes and
suffixes, using the labels pref- and -suf, respec-
tively. In the IGT-XML, we have incorporated this
information in the<morphemes> level as type in-
formation on a morpheme. Figure 3 shows an exam-
ple of this, extended below:
<morph idref="T1.P2.W5" id="T1.P2.W5.M1"
text="tyempo"/>
<morph idref="T1.P2.W5" id="T1.P2.W5.M2"
text="al">
<type l="suf"/>
</morph>
<morph idref="T1.P2.W6" id="T1.P2.W6.M1"
text=",">
<type l="punct"/>
</morph>
By encoding morpheme type as a <type> ele-
ment embedded in the <morph>, we can allow a
single morpheme to bear more than one type label.
For example, an annotator may want to mark a single
morpheme as being an inflectional morpheme which
appears in a suffixal position. This would be in-
dicated by associating multiple <type> elements
with a single<morph> element, differentiating the
<type> elements through use of the label (l) at-
tribute, as shown in the constructed example below.
<morph idref="T3.P1.W3" id="T3.P1.W3.M2"
text="al">
<type l="suf"/>
<type l="infl"/>
</morph>
Furthermore, as the type label is specified in an at-
tribute value, each documentation project can spec-
ify its own list of possible labels.

Figure 4: Shoebox output: Soteapanec
5.2 Soteapanec
Figure 4 shows the Shoebox output for a Soteapanec
phrase.7 In the notation chosen in this project, the
characters ?7? and ?@? refer to phonemes (glottal
stop and mid high unrounded vowel, respectively),
while ?-?, ?+?, ?>?, ?=? and ?.? all mark morpheme
boundaries. Clitic boundaries are marked by ?+?, in-
flectional boundaries by ?-?, derivational boundaries
by ?>? or ?.?, and compounds are indicated with ?=?.
The four different morpheme boundaries translate
to morpheme types in the IGT-XML, which are en-
coded as in the Q?anjob?al case:
<morph idref="T1.P2.W1" id="T1.P2.W1.M1"
text="weenyi"/>
<morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M1"
text="woonyi=jay">
<type l="compound"/>
</morph>
<morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M2"
text="ty@@xi"/>
<morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M3"
text="tam">
<type l="suf"/>
</morph>
The encoding of the compound represents one of
many choices to be made by users of IGT-XML. We
have chosen to present the compound woonyi=jay as
a single morpheme, in line with the linguist?s choice
to notate the compounds this way in the text. An al-
ternative would be to break the compound into two
separate morphemes, each marked as a compound
via the l attribute of the <type> element.
A similar choice exists with respect to the repre-
sentation of other derivational morphology, both at
the level of morphological segmentation and at the
level of the plaintext. In this case, the plaintext of the
Soteapanec includes boundary markers. IGT-XML

can accommodate this type of text as well as it can a
truly plain text.
In this Shoebox output, there is no typograph-
ical alignment between annotation levels. So the
manual transformation to IGT-XML had to rely on
counting morphemes. However there are frequent
mismatches between the number of morphemes in
the morphological level (\mb) and the gloss level
(\gs). The second group of lines in Figure 4 shows
an example: There are six morphemes on the \mb
level, but seven on the \gs level. We envision that
automatic transformation to IGT-XMLwill flag such
cases as mismatched, thus functioning as error de-
tection for the annotation. Even in the manual trans-
formation process, we have marked mismatches at
the gloss level to facilitate adjudication by the anno-
tator.
<morph idref="T1.P2.W2.M4"><gls text="HPL"
flag="mismatch" flagsrc="amp"
flagdate="031507"/>
</morph>
We also include the source and date of the flag, at-
tributes which could easily be obtained automati-
cally.
This section provides only a sample of the is-
sues encountered using IGT-XML. One of our next
steps is to work on automatic transformations from
Shoebox data formats to IGT-XML, a stage at which
many of these challenges will necessarily be ad-
dressed.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced a new XML for-
mat for representing language documentation data,
IGT-XML. At the heart of the model is a represen-
tation of interlinearized glossed text (IGT). Building
on the BHB model (Hughes et al, 2003), IGT-XML
represents original text, its translation, a morpholog-
ical analysis of the original text, and a morpheme-
by-morpheme gloss. Different annotation layers are
represented separately in a modular fashion, allow-
ing for flexible annotation of individual layers as
well as the extension by further annotation layers.
Layers are linked explicitly via globally unique IDs,
using id and idref attributes.
One main aim in the design of the IGT-XML for-
mat is to facilitate the (semi-)automatic annotation
of language documentation data. In fact, our next
step will be to explore the use of computational tools
for speeding up and extending the annotation of less-
studied languages. This connection of documentary
and computational linguistics has the potential to be
very useful to documentary linguists. It also repre-
sents an interesting opportunity for the use of semi-
supervised machine learning techniques like active
learning on a novel application.
