ABSTRACT: The de f in i t ion  texts  of a mach ine- readable  
pocket d ic t ionary  were analyzed to determine the 
d isambiguated word sense of the kerne l  terms of each 
word sense being de f ined .  The resu l tant  se ts  of word 
pa i rs  of def ined and de f in ing  words were then 
computaCional ly connected in to  t~o taxonomic semi- 
la t t i ces  ( " tang led  h ie rarch ies" )  represent ing  some 
24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes. The study of 
the nature  of the "topmost" nodes in  these h ie rarch ies .  
and the s t ruc ture  of the t rees  revea l  in fo rmat ion  about 
the nature of the dictionary's organization of the 
language,  the concept of semantic p r imi t ives  and other  
aspects  of lex ica l  semant ics .  The data proves that  the 
d ic t ionary  o f fe rs  a fundamenta l ly  cons is tent  descr ip t ion  
of word meaning and may provide the bas i s  for  fu ture  
research  and app l i ca t ions  in computat ional  l ingu is t i c  
systems.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
In the la te  1960"s, John 01ney et  a l .  at  System 
Development Corporat ion produced machine- readable  copies 
of the Merriam-Webster New Pocke~ D ic t ionary  and the 
Sevent~ Co l leg ia te  D ic t ionary .  These 
massive data f i l es  have been w ide ly  d i s t r ibuted  w i th in  
the computat ional  l ingu is t i c  community, yet  research  
upon the bas ic  s t ruc ture  of the d ic t ionary  has been 
exceed ing ly  slow and d i f f i cu l t  due to the S ign i f i cant  
computer esources  requ i red  to process  tens  of thousands 
of de f in i t ions .  
The d ic t ionary  i s  a fasc inat ing  computat ional  resource .  
It conta ins  spe l l ing ,  p ronunc ia t ion ,  hyphenation, 
capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains, 
geographic  reg ions ,  and propr ie ty ;  e tymolog ica l ,  
syntact i c  and semant ic  in fo rmat ion  about the most bas ic  
un i t s  of the language.  Accompanying de f in i t ions  are 
example sentences  which o f ten  use words in  p ro to typ ica l  
contexts .  Thus the d ic t ionary  should be ab le  to serve 
as a resource for  a var ie ty  of computat ional  l ingu is t i c  
needs. My primary concern w i th in  the d ic t ionary  has 
been the development of d ic t ionary  data  for  use in 
understand ing  systems.  Thus I am concerned wi th  what 
d ic t ionary  de f in i t ions  te l l  us about the semantic and 
pragmat ic  s t ruc ture  of meaning. The hypothes is  I am 
proposing i s  that  de f in i t ions  in  the lex icon  can be 
s tud ied  in the same manner as other  la rge  co l lec t ions  of 
ob jec ts  such as p lants ,  an imals ,  and minera ls  are  
s tud ied .  Thus I am concerned wi th  enunerat ing  the 
c lass i f i ca t ions1  organ izat ion  of the lex icon  as i t  has 
been imp l i c i t l y  used by the d ic t ionary ' s  lex icographers .  
Each textual definition in the dictionary is 
syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more 
kernel terms. If one identifies these kernel terms of 
def in i t ions ,  and then proceeds to d isambiguate them 
re la t ive  to the senses o f fe red  in the same d ic t ionary  
under the i r  respect ive  de f in i t ions ,  then one can ar r ive  
at  a la rge  co l lec t ion  of pa i rs  of d isambiguated words 
which can be assembled in to  a taxonomic semi - la t t i ce .  
This task  has been accompl ished for  a l l  the de f in i t ion  
texts  of nouns and verbs in  a comu~n pocket d ic t ionary .  
This paper i s  an e f fo r t  to revea l  the resu l t s  of a 
p re l iminary  examinat ion of the s t ruc ture  of these 
databases. 
The app l i ca t ions  of th i s  data are s t i l l  in the fu ture .  
What might these app l i ca t ions  be? 
F i r s t ,  the data shoul'd prov ide in fo rmat ion  on the 
contents  of semant ic  domains. One should be ab le  to 
determine from a lex ica l  taxonomy what domains one 
might be in g iven one has encountered the word 
"periscope", or "petiole", or "petroleum". 
Second, d ic t ionary  data  should be of use in  reso lv ing  
semantic ambigui ty  in text .  Words in  de f in i t ions  
appear in  the company of the i r  p ro to typ ica l  
assoc ia tes .  
Third,  d ic t ionary  data  can provide the bas i s  for  
c reat ing  case gr- , -~-r  descr ip t ions  of verbs ,  and noun 
argument descr ip t ions  of nouns. Semantic templates  of 
meaning are fa r  r i cher  when one cons iders  the 
taxonomic inher i tance  of e lements of the lex icon .  
Fourth.  the d ic t ionary  should o f fe r  a c lass i f i ca t ion  
which anthropo log ica l  l i ngu is ts  and psycho l ingu is ts  
can use as an ob jec t ive  re ference  in comparison wi th  
other  cu l tu res  or human memory observat ions .  This 
i sn ' t  to say that  the d ic t ionary ' s  c lass i f i ca t ion  i s  
the same as the cu l tu re ' s  or the human mind 's ,  only 
that  i t  i s  an ob jec t ive  datum from which comparisons 
can be made. 
F i f th .  knowledge of how the d ic t ionary  i s  s t ruc tured  
can be used by lex icographers  to bu i ld  bet ter  
d ic t ionar ies .  
And finally, the d ic t ionary  if converted in to  a 
computer too l  can become more read i ly  access ib le  to 
a l l  the d i sc ip l ines  seek ing Co use the cur rent  
paper-based vers ions .  Educat ion.  h i s to r i ca l  
l i ngu is t i cs ,  soc io logy .  Eng l i sh  composi t ion,  etc.  can 
a l l  make s teps  foxward g iven that  they can assume 
access  to a d ic t ionary  i s  immediate ly  ava i lab le  v ia  
computer. I do not know what a l l  these app l i ca t ions  
wi l l  be and the task  a t  hand i s  s imply an e luc idat ion  
of the d ic t ionary ' s  s t ruc ture  as i t  cur rent ly  ex i s ts .  
2. "TANGLED" HIERARCHIES OF NOVN S AND VERBS 
The grant. MCS77-01315, '~)evelopment of a Computational 
Methodology for  Der iv ing Natura l  Language Semantic 
S t ruc tures  v ia  Ana lys i s  of Machine-Readable 
D ic t ionar ies" .  c reated  a taxonomy for  the nouns and 
verbs of the Merriam-Webster Pocket D ic t ionary  (MPD), 
based upon the hand-d isambiguated kerne l  words in  the i r  
definitions. This taxonomy confirmed the ant i c ipated  
s t ruc ture  of the lex icon  to be that  of a " tang led  
h ie rarchy"  \[8,9\] of unprecedented s i ze  (24,000 noun 
senses .  11.000 verb senses) .  This data base i s  be l ieved  
to be the f i r s t  Co be assembled which i s  representat ive  
of the s t ruc ture  of the ent i re  Eng l i sh  lex icon .  (A 
somewhat s imi la r  study of the I ta l ian  lex icon  has been 
done \[2.11\] ) .  The content  categor ies  agree 
substant ia l l y  w i th  the semant ic  s t ruc ture  of the lex icon  
proposed by Nida \ [ I5 \ ] ,  and the verb taxonomy confirms 
the pr imi t ives  proposed by the San Diego LNR group \[16\] .  
This " tang led  h ie rarchy"  may be descr ibed  as a formal 
data s t ruc ture  whose bottom is  a se t  of terminal  
d isambiguated words that  are  not used as kerne l  de f in ing  
terms; these are the most spec i f i c  e lexents  in the 
s t ruc ture .  The tops of the s t ruc ture  are senses of 
words such as "cause" ,  " th ing" ,  '*c lass",  "being" ,  e tc .  
These are the most genera l  e lements in  the tangled 
h ie rarchy .  I f  a l l  the top terms are  considered to be 
133 
members of the metaclass "<word-sense>", the tangled 
forest becomes a tangled tree. 
The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each 
connected to the Cop in a la t t i ce .  An ind iv idua l  
lattice can be resolved into a seC of "traces", each of 
which describes an alternate paCh from terminal to cop. 
In a crate, each element implies the terms above iC, and 
further specifies the sense of the elements below it. 
The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic 
digraph (or perhaps more clearly, a "semi-lattice", that 
is, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, <word-sense>, 
but no least lower bound). If we specify all the traces 
composing such a structure, spanning all paths from top 
to bottom, we have topologically spec i f ied  the 
semi-lattice. Thus the list on the left in Figure I 
topologically specifies the tangled hierarchy on its 
r ight .

2.1 TOPMOST SEMANTIC NODES OF THE TANGLED HIERARCHIES 
Turning from the abst rac t  descr ip t ion  of the fo res t  of 
tang led  h ie rarch ies  Co the actua l  data ,  the f i r s t  
quest ion  which was answered was, 'What are  the la rgest  
tang led  h ie rarch ies  in  the d ic t ionary?" .  The s i ze  of a 
tang led  h ie rarchy  i s  based upon two numbers, the maximum 
depth below the " root"  and the to ta l  number of nodes 
t rans i t i ve ly  reachab le  from the root .  Thus the tang led  
h ie rarchy  of F igure  1 has a depth of 5 and conCains a 
to ta l  of 11 nodes ( inc lud ing  the " root"  node, "a" ) .  
However, since each non-terminal in Che tangled 
h ierarchy  was a l so  enumerated, i t  i s  a l so  poss ib le  Co 
descr ibe  the "s i zes"  of che o ther  nodes reachab le  from 
"a" .  Thei r  number of elemenCs and depChs g iven  in Table

These examples are being g iven co demonstrate  the 
inherenC consequences of dea l ing  wich t ree  s i zes  based 
upon these measurements. For example, "g" has the most 
single-level descendants, 3, yet it is neither at the 
Cop of the Cangled hierarchy, nor does iC have the 
highest total number of descendants? The root node "a" 
is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has I 
single-level descendant. For nodes ?o he considered of 
major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is chus 
necessary to consider not only Cheir total number of 
descendants ,  buc whether Chese descendants  a re  a l l  
accua l ly  immediate ly  under some ocher node Co which th i s  
h igher  node i s  a t tached .  As we sha l l  see,  che nodes 
which have the most s ing le - leve l  descendants are 
actua l ly  more p ivora l  concepts  in some cases .  
Turning to the ac tua l  fo res t  of Cangled h ie rarch ies ,  
Table 2 g ives  the f requenc ies  of the s i ze  and depth of 
the la rgest  noun h ie rarch ies  and Table 3 g ives  the s i zes

The l i s t  appears  in  te rms of  descend ing  f requency .  The 
topmost  nodes don ' t  have  many descendants  a t  one leve l  
be low,  but  they  each  have  one BIG descendant ,  the  next  
node in the chain. CAUSE-2.0A has approximately 240 
d i rect  descendants ,  and MAKE-I.IA has  480 d i rect  
descendants  making these  t~o the  topmost  nodes  in  
te rms o f  number of  d i rec t  descendants ,  though they  are  
ranked 9th  and 13th  in  te rms o f  to ta l  descendants  (under  
words  such  as EDL%IN-.4A, CONTINUE-.1A, e tc . ) .  Th is  
po in ts  out  in  pract i ce  what  the  abst ract  t ree  of  F igure  
I showed as  poss ib le  in  theory ,  and exp la ins  the  seeming 
cont rad ic t ion  in  hav ing  a bas ic  verb  such  as 
"CAUSE-2.0A" de f ined  in  te rms o f  a lesser  verb  such  as 
'~EMAIN- .4a" .  
The d i f f i cu l ty  i s  exp la inab le  g iven  two fac ts .  F i r s t .  
the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2.0A using some 
other verb, etc. This is inherent in the lexicon being 
used to define itself. Second, once one reaches the Cop 
of a tengled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -- and 
consequently forcing further definitions for bas ic  verbs 
such as "be"  and "cause" invariably leads CO using more 
spec i f i c  verbs ,  ra ther  than  more genera l  ones .  The 
s i tuat ion  i s  ne i ther  e r roneous ,  nor  incons is tent  in  the  
context  of  a se l f -de f ined  c losed  sys tem and w i l l  be

caused  by hav ing  sequences  of  in ter re la ted  def in i t ions

what  was not  ant ic ipated  was how impor tant  such  c lus ters

Figure 4. "GROUP" Concept Primitive from 
Dictionary Definitions 
* Note: SECTIONS, PARTS, and GROUPINGS have additional 
connections not shown which lead to a related 
primitive cluster dealing with the PART/WHOLE concept. 
This complex interrelated set of definitions comprise a 
primitive concept, essentially equivalent to the notion 
of SET in mathematics. The primitiveness of the set is 
evident when one attempts to define any one of the above 
words without using another of them in that definition. 
135 
This essential property, the inability to write a 
def in i t ion  exp la in ing  a word 's  meaning w i thout  us ing  
another  member of some smal l  se t  of near  synonymous 
words,  is  the bas is  fo r  descr ib ing  such a set  as a 
PRIMITIVE. It is based upon the  notion of definition 
given by Wilder \[21\], which in turn was based upon a 
presentation of the ideas of Padoa, a 
turn-of-the-century logician. 
The definitions are given, the disambiguation of their 
kerne l ' s  senses  leads  to a cyc l i c  s t ructure  which cannot  
be reso lved  by a t t r ibut ing  er roneous  judgements  to 
e i ther  the lex icographer  or the d i sambiguator ;  there fore  
the s t ructure  i s  taken  as representat ive  of  an 
undefinable pyimitive concept, and the words whose 
definitions participate in this complex structure are 
found Co be undefinable without reference to the other 
members of the set of undefined terms. 
The question of what to do with such primitives is not 
really a problem, as Winograd notes \[22\], once one 
realizes that they must exist at some leve l ,  just as 
mathematical primitives must exist. In tree 
const ruct ion  the so lu t ion  is to  form a s ing le  node whose 
Eng l i sh  sur face  representat ion  may be se lec ted  from any 
of the words in  the pr imi t ive  set .  There probab ly  a re  
connotat ive  d i f fe rences  between the members of  the set .  
but the ord inary  pocket  d ic t ionary  does not  t reat  these  
in i t s  de f in i t ions  w i th  any deta i l .  The Merr iam-Webster  
Col lemfaCe D ic t ionary  does inc lude  so -ca l led  "synonym 
paragraphs"  which seem to d i scuss  the connotat ive  
d i f fe rences  between words shar ing  a " r ing" .  
While numerous s tud ies  of  lex ica l  domains such as the  
verbs  of  mot ion \ [1 ,12 ,13 \ ]  and possess ion  \[10\] have been 
car r ied  out  by ocher  researchers ,  i t  i s  wor th  not ing  
that  recourse  to us ing  ord inary  d ic t ionary  de f in i t ions  
as a source  of mater ia l  has rece ived  l i t t le  a t tent ion .  
Yet the "pr imi t ives"  se lec ted  by Donald A. Norman, 
David E. Romelhar t ,  and the  LNR Research  Group fo r  
knowledge representat ion  in  the i r  system bear  a 
remarkable similarity to those verbs used must often as 
kerne ls  in  The Merriam-Webster Pocket Dic t ionary  and 
Donald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbs 
to be among the most common verbs  in  the  Co l leg ia te  
D ic t ionary  as we l l  \ [19 \ ] .  The most f requent  verbs  of  the 
MPD are ,  in descend ing  order .  MAKE, BE, BECOME, CAUSE, 
GIVE, MOVE, TAKE, PUT, FORM, BEING, HAVE. and GO. The

2.3 NOUNS TERMINATING IN RELATIONS 
TO oTHER NOUNS OR VERBS 
In addition to  terminating in "dictionary circles" or 
"loops", nouns also terminate in definitions which are 
actually text descriptions of case arguments of verbs or 
relationships to other nouns. "Vehicle" is a fine 
example of  the  fo rmer ,  be ing  as  it were  the  canon ica l  
ins t rumenta l  case  argument  of  one sense  of  the  verb  
"carry" or "transport". 
veh ic le  - a means of  car ry ing  or  t ranspor t ing  
someth ing  
'~eaf"  i s  an  example  of the  le t te r ,  be ing  def ined  as a 
par t  of a p lant ,  
leaf - a usu. flat and green outgrowth of a plant 
stem that is a unit of foliage and functions 
esp. in photosynthesis. 
interaction of the PART-OF and ISA hierarchies. 
Historically even Raphael \[17\] used a PART-OF 
relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of gig's 
deduct ion  sys tem.  What however  i s  new i s  that  I am not  
s ta t ing  " lea f "  i s  a par t  of  a p lant  because  of  some need 
use this fact within a particular system's operation.

an e f fo r t  to  assemble  the  complete  lex ica l  s t ruc ture  of  
the  d ic t ionary .  
2.4 PARTITIVES AND COLLECTIVES 
Thus "leaf" isn't a type of anything. Even though under 
a strictly genus/differentia interpretation one would 
analyze "leaf" as being in an ISA relationship with 
"outgrowth", "outgrowth" hasn't a suitable homogeneous 
set of members and a better interpretation for modeling 
this definition would be to consider the "outgrowth of" 
phrase to signify a part/whole relationship between 
"leaf" and "plant". 
Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at least 
two taxonomic relationships (i.e. ISA and ISPART) as 
well as additional relations explaining noun terminals 
as verb arguments. One can also readily see that there 
will be taxonomic interactions among nodes connected 
across these relationship "bridges". 
While the parts of a plant will include the "leaves", 
"stem", "roots", etc., the corresponding parts of any 
TYPE of plant may have further specifications added to 
their descriptions. Thus "plant" specifies a functional 
form which can be further elaborated by descent down its 
ISA chain. For example, a "frond" is a type of  "leaf", 
frond - a usu. large divided leaf (as of a fern) 
We knew from "leaf" that it was a normal outgrowth of a 
"plant", but now we see that "leaf" can be specialized, 
provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a 
"fern" is a "plant". (Such confirmation is only needed 
if we grant "leaf" more than one sense meaning, but 
words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3 
sense meanings). The definition of "fern" gives us the 
needed linkage, offering, 
fern - any of a group of flowerless seedless vascular 
green plants 
Thus we have a specialized name for the "leaf" appendage 
of a "plant" if that plant is a "fern". This can be 
represented as in Figure 6.

F igure  6. LEAF:PLANT::FHOND:FERN 
This conclusion that there are two major transitive 
taxonomies and that they are related is not of course 
new. Evens eta l .  \[6,7\] have dealt with the PART-OF 
relationship as second only to the ISA relationship in 
importance, and Fahlmen \[8,9\] has also discussed the 
As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of "outgrowth" in 
the definition of "leaf" causes problems in the taxonomy 
if we treat "outgrowth" as the true genus term of that 
definition. This word is but one ~*-mple of a broad 
range  of  noun termina ls  wh ich  may be descr ibed  as  
"par t i t i ves" .  A "par t i t i ve"  may be def ined  as  a noun 
wh ich  serves  as  a genera l  te rm for  a PART o f  another  
la rge  and o f ten  very  non-homogeneous  set  of  concepts .  
Add i t iona l ly .  a t  the  oppos i te  end of  the  par t i t i ve

are  words  wh ich  serve  as a genera l  te rm for  a COLLECTION 
of  o ther  concepts .  
The d isambiguators  o f ten  faced  dec is ions  as  to  whether  
some words  were  indeed the  t rue  semant ic  kerne ls  o f  
de f in i t ions ,  and o f ten  found add i t iona l  words  in  the  
de f in i t ions  wh ich  were  more semant ica l ly  appropr ia te  to  
serve  as the  kerne l  - -  a lbe i t  they  d id  not  appear  
syntact i ca l ly  in  the  cor rect  pos i t ion .  Many o f  these  
te rms were  par t i t i ves  and co l lec t ives .  F igure  7 shows a 
set  of  par t i t i ves  and co l lec t ives  wh ich  were  ext racted  
and c lass i f ied  by Gretchen Hazard  and John  Whi te  dur ing  
the  d ic t ionary  pro jec t .  The terms under  "group names" ,  
"whole units", and "system units" are collectives. 
Those under "individuators". "piece units". "space 
shapes", "existential units", "locus units", and "event 
units" are partitives. These terms usually appeared in 
the syntactic frame "An of" and this 
add i t iona l ly  served  to indicate the i r  funct iona l  ro le .
