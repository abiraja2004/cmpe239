Abstract 
Sentiment analysis is one of the recent, 
highly dynamic fields in Natural Language 
Processing. Most existing approaches are 
based on word-level analysis of texts and 
are able to detect only explicit expressions 
of sentiment.  In this paper, we present an 
approach towards automatically detecting 
emotions (as underlying components of 
sentiment) from contexts in which no clues 
of sentiment appear, based on 
commonsense knowledge. The resource we 
built towards this aim ? EmotiNet - is a 
knowledge base of concepts with 
associated affective value. Preliminary 
evaluations show that this approach is 
appropriate for the task of implicit emotion 
detection, thus improving the performance 
of sentiment detection and classification in 
text. 
1 Introduction 
Research in affect has a long established tradition 
in many sciences - linguistics, psychology, socio-
psychology, cognitive science, pragmatics, 
marketing or communication science. Recently, 
many closely related subtasks were developed also 
in the field of Natural Language Proceesing (NLP), 
such as emotion detection, subjectivity analysis, 
opinion mining to sentiment analysis, attitude and 
appraisal analysis or review mining (Pang and Lee, 
2008). 
Among these tasks, sentiment analysis aims at 
detecting the expressions of sentiment in text and 
subsequently classify them, according to their 
polarity (semantic orientation) among different 
categories (usually, among positive and negative). 
The problem is defined by Pang and Lee (2008) as 
?the binary classification task of labeling an 
opinionated document as expressing either an 
overall positive or an overall negative.? (Pang and 
Lee, 2008) 
According to the Webster dictionary 
(http://www.merriam-webster.com/), sentiment suggests 
a settled opinion reflective of one?s feelings, where 
the term feeling is defined as the conscious 
subjective experience of emotion. (Van den Bos, 
2006), ?a single component of emotion, denoting 
the subjective experience process? (Scherer, 2005).  
Most of the research performed in the field of 
sentiment analysis has aimed at detecting explicit 
expressions of sentiment (i.e. situations where 
specific words or word combinations are found in 
texts). Nevertheless, the expression of emotion is 
most of the times not achieved through the use of 
emotion-bearing words (Pennebaker et al, 2003), 
but indirectly, by presenting situations that based 
on commonsense knowledge can be interpreted in 
an affective manner (Balahur and Montoyo, 2008; 
Balahur and Steinberger, 2009).  
In this paper, we present a method to build a 
commonsense knowledge base (EmotiNet) 
representing situations that trigger emotions. We 
demonstrate that by using this resource, we are 
53
able to detect emotion from textual contexts in 
which no explicit mention of affect is present.   
2 State of the Art 
In Artificial Intelligence (AI), the term affective 
computing was first introduced by Picard (1995). 
Previous approaches to spot affect in text include 
the use of models simulating human reactions 
according to their needs and desires (Dyer, 1987), 
fuzzy logic (Subasic and Huettner, 2000), lexical 
affinity based on similarity of contexts ? the basis 
for the construction of WordNet Affect  
(Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) or SentiWord-
Net (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), detection of 
affective keywords (Riloff et al, 2003) and 
machine learning using term frequency (Pang et 
al., 2002; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), or term 
discrimination (Danisman and Alpkocak, 2008). 
Other proposed methods include the creation of 
syntactic patterns and rules for cause-effect 
modeling (Mei Lee et al, 2009). Significantly 
different proposals for emotion detection in text 
are given in the work by (Liu et al 2003) and the 
recently proposed framework of sentic computing 
(Cambria et al, 2009), whose scope is to model 
affective reaction based on commonsense 
knowledge. For a survey on the affect models and 
their affective computing applications, see (Calvo 
and D?Mello, 2010).  
3 Motivation and Contribution 
The tasks of emotion detection and sentiment 
analysis have been approached by a large volume 
of research in NLP . Nevertheless, most of this 
research has concentrated on developing methods 
for detecting only explicit mentions of sentiment in 
text. Therefore, sentences such as ?I?m going to a 
party?, which express an underlying emotion, 
cannot be classified by most of the existing 
approaches. A method to overcome this issue is 
proposed in by sentic computing (Cambria et al, 
2009) and by (Liu et al 2003), whose main idea is 
acquiring knowledge on the emotional effect of 
different concepts. In this manner, the system 
would know that ?going to a party? is something 
that produces ?joy?. However, more complex 
contexts, such as ?I?m going to a party, although I 
should study for my exam.?, where the emotion 
expressed is most probably ?guilt?, cannot be 
correctly detected and classified by present 
systems. 
In the light of these considerations, our 
contribution relies in proposing and implementing 
a framework for modeling affect based on the 
appraisal theories, which can support the automatic 
processing of texts to extract: 
? The components of the situation presented 
(which we denote by ?action chains?) and 
their relation (temporal, causal etc.) 
? The elements on which the appraisal is 
done in each action of the chain (agent, 
action, object); 
? The appraisal criteria that can 
automatically be determined from the text 
(modifiers of the action, actor, object in 
each action chain); 
4 Modeling Affective Reaction Using 
Commonsense Knowledge  
Our main idea is that emotion can be expressed in 
text by presenting a sequence of actions (situations 
in which different concepts appear), which, based 
on commonsense knowledge and previous 
experiences, trigger an emotional reaction. This 
idea is linked to the Appraisal Theories, which 
claim that emotions are elicited and differentiated 
on the basis of the subjective evaluation of the 
personal significance of a situation, object or event 
(De Rivera, 1977; Frijda, 1986; Johnson-Laird and 
Oatley, 1989 ? among others). Viewed in a simpler 
manner, a situation is presented as a chain of 
actions, each with an actor and an object; the 
appraisal depends on the temporal and causal 
relationship between them, on the characteristics of 
the actors involved in the action and on the object 
of the action.  
Given this insight, the general idea behind our 
approach is to model situations as chains of actions 
and their corresponding emotional effect using an 
ontological representation. According to the 
definition provided by Studer et al (1998), an 
ontology captures knowledge shared by a 
community that can be easily sharable with other 
communities. These two characteristics are 
especially relevant if we want the recall of our 
approach to be increased. Knowledge managed in 
our approach has to be shared by a large 
community and it also needs to be fed by 
heterogeneous sources of common knowledge to 
54
avoid uncertainties. However, specific assertions 
can be introduced to account for the specificities of 
individuals or contexts. In this manner, we can 
model the interaction of different events in the 
context in which they take place. 
5 Building a Knowledge Base for 
Detecting Implicit Expressions of 
Emotion 
In order to build a resource that is capable of 
capturing emotional reaction to real-world 
situations in which commonsense knowledge plays 
a significant role in the affective interpretation, we 
aim at representing chains of actions and their 
corresponding emotional labels from several 
situations in such a way that we will be able to 
extract general patterns of appraisal. Our approach 
defines an action chain as a sequence of action 
links, or simply actions that trigger an emotion on 
an actor. Each specific action link can be described 
with a tuple (actor, action type, patient, emotional 
reaction). 
In order to manage and store action chains, the 
approach we propose defines a new knowledge 
base, called EmotiNet, which aims to be a resource 
for detecting emotions in text, and a 
(semi)automatic, iterative process to build it, which 
is based on existing knowledge from different 
sources. This process extracts the action chains 
from a set of documents and adds them to the KB. 
Specifically, EmotiNet was built by following the 
next steps: 
1. The design of an ontology, which contains 
the definitions of the main concepts of the 
domain.  
2. The extension and population of this 
ontology using the situations stored in the 
ISEAR International Survey of Emotional 
Antecedents and Reactions (ISEAR, 
http://www.unige.ch/fapse/emotion/databanks/isear.
html) ? (Scherer and Wallbott, 1997) 
database. 
3.  The expansion of the ontology using 
existing commonsense knowledge bases ? 
ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004) and 
other resources ? VerbOcean (Chklovski 
and Pantel, 2004). 
5.1 Design of the Ontology 
As mentioned before, the process of building the 
core of the EmotiNet knowledge base (KB) of 
action chains started with the design of the core 
ontology, whose design process was specifically 
divided in three stages:  
1. Establishing the scope and purpose of the 
ontology. The EmotiNet ontology needs to capture 
and manage knowledge from three domains: 
kinship membership, emotions (and their relations) 
and actions (characteristics and relations between 
them).   
2. Reusing knowledge from existing ontologies. 
In a second stage, we searched for other ontologies 
on the Web containing concepts related to the 
knowledge cores we specified. At the end of the 
process, we located two ontologies that are reused 
in our ontological representation: the ReiAction 
ontology (www.cs.umbc.edu/~lkagal1/rei 
/ontologies/ReiAction.owl), which represents actions 
between entities in a general manner, and the 
family ontology (www.dlsi.ua.es/~jesusmhc/emotinet 
/family.owl), which contains knowledge about 
family members and the relations between them.

3. Creating the final knowledge core from the 
ontologies imported. This third stage involved the 
design of the last remaining core, i.e. emotion, and 
the combination of the different knowledge sources 
into a single ontology: EmotiNet. In order to 
describe the emotions and the way they relate and 
compose, we employ Robert Plutchik?s wheel of 
emotion (Plutchik, 2001) and Parrot?s tree-
55
structured list of emotions (Parrot, 2001). These 
models contain an explicit modeling of the 
relations between the different emotions. At the 
end of the design process, the knowledge core 
included different types of relations between 
emotions and a collection of specific instances of 
emotion (e.g. anger, joy). In the last step, these 
three cores were combined using new classes and 
relations between the existing members of these 
ontologies (Fig. 2).

5.2 Extension and Population of the Ontology 
In order to have a homogenous starting base, we 
selected from the 7667 examples in the ISEAR 
database only the 1081 cases that contained 
descriptions of situations between family members. 
Subsequently, the examples were POS-tagged 
using TreeTagger. Within each emotion class, we 
then computed the similarity of the examples with 
one another, using the implementation of the Lesk 
distance in Ted Pedersen?s Similarity Package. 
This score was used to split the examples in each 
emotion class into six clusters using the Simple K-
Means implementation in Weka. The idea behind 
this approach, confirmed by the output of the 
clusters, was to group examples that are similar, in 
vocabulary and structure. From this collection, we 
manually selected a subset of 175 documents with 
25 expressions related to each of the emotions: 
anger, disgust, guilt, fear, sadness, joy and shame. 
The criteria for choosing this subset were the 
simplicity of the sentences and the variety of 
actions described. 
The next step was to extract the actions chains 
described in each of the examples. For this, we 
employed Semrol, the semantic role labeling (SRL) 
system introduced by Moreda et al (2007). For the 
core of knowledge in the EmotiNet KB, we need 
100% accurate information. Therefore, we 
manually extract the agent, the verb and the patient 
(the surface object of the verb) from the output of 
Semrol. For example, if we use the input sentence 
?I?m going to a family party because my mother 
obliges me to?, the system extracts two triples with 
the main actors of the sentences: (I, go, family 
party) and (mother, oblige, me), related by the 
causal adverb ?because?.  
Further on, we resolve the anaphoric expressions 
automatically, using a heuristic selection of the 
family member mentioned in the text that is closest 
to the anaphoric reference and whose properties 
(gender, number) are compatible with the ones of 
the reference. The replacement of the references to 
the speaker, e.g. ?I?, ?me?, ?myself?, is resolved by 
taking into consideration the entities mentioned in 
the sentence. In case of ambiguity, we choose the 
youngest, female member. Following the last 
example, the subject of the action would be 
assigned to the daughter of the family and the 
triples would be updated: (daughter, go, 
family_party) and (mother, oblige, daughter). 
Finally, the action links (triplets) are grouped and 
sorted in action chains. This process of sorting is 
determined by the adverbial expressions that 
appear within the sentence, which actually specify 
the position of each action on a temporal line (e.g. 
?although? ?because?, ?when?). We defined 
pattern rules according to which the actions 
introduced by these modifiers happen prior to or 
after the current context.   
Using our combined emotion model as a reference, 
we manually assigned one of the seven most basic 
emotions, i.e. anger, fear, disgust, shame, sadness, 
joy or guilt, or the neutral value to all the action 
links obtained, thus generating 4-tuples (subject, 
action, object, emotion), e.g. (daughter, go, family 
party, neutral) or (mother, oblige, daughter, 
disgust).  
Once we carried out these processes on the chosen 
documents, we obtained 175 action chains (ordered 
lists of tuples). In order to be included in the 
EmotiNet knowledge base, all their action links 
needed to be mapped to existing concepts or 
instances within the KB. When these did not exist, 
they were added to it. We would like to highlight 
that in EmotiNet, each tuple (actor, action, patient, 
emotion) extracted has its own representation as an 
instance of the subclasses of Action. Each in-stance 
56
of Action is related to an instance of the class Feel, 
which represents the emotion felt in this action. 
Subsequently, these instances (action links) were 
grouped in sequences of actions (class Sequence) 
ended by an instance of the class Feel, which 
determine the final emotion felt by the main 
actor(s) of the chain.  
In our example, we created two new classes Go 
and Oblige (subclasses of DomainAction) and two 
new instances of them: instance act1 (?Go?, 
?daughter?, ?family_party?, ?Neutral?); and 
instance act2 (?Oblige?, ?mother?, ?daughter?, 
?Angry?). The last action link already existed 
within EmotiNet from another chain so we reused 
it: instance act3 (?Feel?, ?daughter?, ?anger?). The 
next step consisted in grouping these instances into 
sequences by means of instances of the class 
Sequence, which is a subclass of Action that can 
establish the temporal order between two actions 
(which one occurred first). Fig. 3 shows an 
example of a RDF graph with the action chain of 
our example. We used Jena 
(http://jena.sourceforge.net/) and MySQL for the 
management and storage of EmotiNet on a 
database.

5.3 Ontology Expansion 
In order to extend the coverage of the resource, we 
expanded the ontology with the actions and 
relations from VerbOcean. This process is essential 
for EmotiNet, since it adds new types of action and 
relations between actions, which might not have 
been analyzed before, thus reducing the degree of 
dependency between the resource and the initial set 
of examples. In particular, 299 new actions were 
automatically included as subclasses of 
DomainAction, which were directly related to any 
of the actions of our ontology through three new 
relations: can-result-in, happens-before and 
similar. 
6 Experiments and Evaluation 
The evaluation of our approach consists in testing 
if by employing the model we built and the 
knowledge contained in the core of EmotiNet 
(which we denote by ?knowledge sets?), we are 
able to detect the emotion expressed in new 
examples pertaining to the categories in ISEAR. 
Therefore, we use a test set (marked with B) that 
contains 895 examples (ISEAR phrases 
corresponding to the seven emotions modeled, 
from which core examples were removed).  
In order to assess the system performance on the 
two test sets, we followed the same process we 
used for building the core of EmotiNet, with the 
exception that the manual modeling of examples 
into tuples was replaced with the automatic 
extraction of (actor, verb, patient) triples from the 
output given by Semrol. Subsequently, we 
eliminated the stopwords in the phrases contained 
in these three roles and performed a simple corefe-
rence resolution. Next, we ordered the actions 
presented in the phrase, using the adverbs that 
connect the sentences, through the use of patterns 
(temporal, causal etc.). The resulted action chains 
for each of the examples in the two test sets will be 
used in carrying different experiments:  
 (1). In the first approach, for each of the situations 
in the test sets (represented now as action chains), 
we search the EmotiNet KB to encounter the 
sequences in which these actions in the chains are 
involved and their corresponding subjects. As a 
result of the search process, we obtain the emotion 
label corresponding to the new situation and the 
subject of the emotion based on a weighting 
function. This function takes into consideration the 
number of actions and the position in which they 
appear in the sequence contained in EmotiNet. The 
issue in this first approach is that many of the 
examples cannot be classified, as the knowledge 
they contain is not present in the ontology.  
(2). A subsequent approach aimed at surpassing the 
issues raised by the missing knowledge in 
EmotiNet. In a first approximation, we aimed at 
introducing extra knowledge from VerbOcean, by 
adding the verbs that were similar to the ones in 
57
the core examples (represented in VerbOcean 
through the ?similar? relation). Subsequently, each 
of the actions in the examples to be classified that 
was not already contained in EmotiNet, was sought 
in VerbOcean. In case one of the similar actions 
was already contained in the KB, the actions were 
considered equivalent. Further on, each action was 
associated with an emotion, using the ConceptNet 
relations and concepts (HasSubevent, Causes, 
ConceptuallyRelatedTo, HasPrerequisite). Finally, 
new examples were matched against chains of 
actions containing the same emotions, in the same 
order.  While more complete than the first 
approximation, this approach was also affected by 
lack of knowledge about the emotional content of 
actions. To overcome this issue, we proposed two 
heuristics: 
(2a) In the first one, actions on which no affect 
information was available, were sought in within 
the examples already introduced in the EmotiNet 
and were assigned the most frequent class of 
emotion labeling them. The corresponding results 
are marked with A2a and B2a, respectively. 
 (2b) In the second approximation, we used the 
most frequent emotion associated to the known 
links of a chain, whose individual emotions were 
obtained from ConceptNet.  In this case, the core 
of action chains is not involved in the process. The 
corresponding results are marked with A2b and 
B2b. 
We performed the steps described on test set B. 
The results are shown in Table 1 (results on 
classified examples) and Table 2 (results on all 
examples).

7 Discussion and conclusions 
From the results in Table 1 and 2, we can conclude 
that the approach is valid and represents a method 
that is appropriate for the detection of emotions 
from contexts where no affect-related words are 
present. Nonetheless, much remains to be done to 
fully exploit the capabilities of EmotiNet. We 
showed that the approach has a high degree of 
flexibility, i.e. new information can be easily 
introduced from existing common-sense 
knowledge bases, such as ConceptNet, mainly due 
to its internal structure and degree of granularity.  
The error analysis we performed shed some light 
on the causes of error of the system. The first 
finding is that extracting only the action, verb and 
patient semantic roles is not sufficient. There are 
other roles, such as the modifiers, which change 
the overall emotion in the text. Therefore, such 
modifiers should be included as attributes of the 
concepts identified in the roles. A further source of 
errors was that lack of knowledge on specific 
actions. Thus, the results of our approach can be 
practically limited by the structure, expressivity 
and degree of granularity of the imported 
resources. Therefore, to obtain the final, extended 
version of EmotiNet we should analyze the 
interactions between the core and the imported 
resources and among these re-sources as well. 
Finally, other errors were produced by NLP 
processes and propagated at various steps of the 
processing chain (e.g. SRL, coreference 
resolution). Some of these errors cannot be 
eliminated; however, others can be partially solved 
by using alternative NLP tools.  
Future work aims at extending the model by 
adding affective properties to the concepts 
58
included, so that more of the appraisal criteria can 
be introduced in the model, testing new methods to 
assign affective value to the concepts and adding 
new knowledge from sources such as CYC.
