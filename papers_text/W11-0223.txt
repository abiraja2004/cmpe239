Abstract
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an inter-
mediate task within information retrieval and
information extraction, attempting to select
the proper sense of ambiguous words. Due to
the scarcity of training data, semi-supervised
learning, which profits from seed annotated
examples and a large set of unlabeled data,
are worth researching. We present preliminary
results of two semi-supervised learning algo-
rithms on biomedical word sense disambigua-
tion. Both methods add relevant unlabeled ex-
amples to the training set, and optimal param-
eters are similar for each ambiguous word.
1 Introduction
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an interme-
diate task within information retrieval and informa-
tion extraction, attempting to select the proper sense
of ambiguous words. Supervised learning achieves
better performance compared to other WSD ap-
proaches (Jimeno-Yepes et al, 2011). Manual anno-
tation requires a large level of human effort whereas
there is a large quantity of unlabeled data. Our
work follows (Mihalcea, 2004) but is applied to the
biomedical domain; it relies on two semi-supervised
learning algorithms.
We have performed experiments of semi-
supervised learning for word sense disambiguation
in the biomedical domain. In the following section,
we present the evaluated algorithms. Then, we
present preliminary results for self-training and
co-training, which show a modest improvement
with a common set-up of the algorithms for the
evaluated ambiguous words.
2 Methods
For self-training we use the definition by (Clark et
al., 2003): ?a tagger that is retrained on its own
labeled cache on each round?. The classifier is
trained on the available training data which is then
used to label the unlabeled examples from which
the ones with enough prediction confidence are se-
lected and added to the training set. The process
is repeated for a number of predefined iterations.
Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) uses several
classifiers trained on independent views of the same
instances. These classifiers are then used to label the
unlabeled set, and from this newly annotated data
set the annotations with higher prediction probabil-
ity are selected. These newly labeled examples are
added to the training set and the process is repeated
for a number of iterations. Both bootstrapping algo-
rithms produce an enlarged training data set.
Co-training requires two independent views on
the same data set. As first view, we use the context
around the ambiguous word. As second view, we
use the MEDLINE MeSH indexing available from
PubMed which is obtained by human assignment of
MeSH heading based on their full-text articles.
Methods are evaluated with the accuracy mea-
sure on the MSH WSD set built automatically using
MeSH indexing from MEDLINE (Jimeno-Yepes et
al., 2011) 1 in which senses are denoted by UMLS
concept identifiers. To avoid any bias derived from

the indexing of the UMLS concept related to the am-
biguous word, the concept has been removed from
the MeSH indexing of the recovered citations.
10-fold cross validation using Na??ve Bayes (NB)
has been used to compare both views which achieve
similar accuracy (0.9386 context text, 0.9317 MeSH
indexing) while the combined view achieves even
better accuracy (0.9491).
In both algorithms a set of parameters is used: the
number of iterations (1-10), the size of the pool of
unlabeled examples (100, 500, 1000) and the growth
rate or number of unlabeled examples which are se-
lected to be added to the training set (1, 10, 20, 50,
100).
3 Results and discussion
Results shown in Table 1 have been obtained from
21 ambiguous words which achieved lower perfor-
mance in a preliminary cross-validation study. Each
ambiguous word has around 2 candidate senses with
100 examples for each sense. We have split the ex-
amples for each ambiguous word into 2/3 for train-
ing and 1/3 for test.
The baseline is NB trained and tested using this
split. Semi-supervised algorithms use this split, but
the training data is enlarged with selected unlabeled
examples. Self-training and the baseline use the
combined views while co-training relies on two NB
classifiers, each trained on one view of the train-
ing data. Even though we are willing to evalu-
ate other classifiers, NB was selected for this ex-
ploratory work since it is fast and space efficient.
Unlabeled examples are MEDLINE citations which
contain the ambiguous word and MeSH heading
terms. Any mention of MeSH heading related to the
ambiguous word has been removed. Optimal param-
eters were selected, and average accuracy is shown
in Table 1.
Method Accuracy
Baseline 0.8594
Self-training 0.8763 (1.93%)
Co-training 0.8759 (1.88%)
Table 1: Accuracy for the baseline, self-training and co-
training
Both semi-supervised algorithms show a modest
improvement on the baseline which is a bit higher
for self-training. Best results are achieved with a
small number of iterations (< 5), a small growth
rate (1-10) and a pool of unlabeled data over 100 in-
stances. Noise affects the performance with a larger
number of iterations, which after an initial increase,
shows a steep decrease in accuracy. Small growth
rate ensures a smoothed increase in accuracy. A
larger growth rate adds more noise after each iter-
ation. A larger pool of unlabeled data offers a larger
set of candidate unlabeled examples to choose from
at a higher computational cost.
4 Conclusions and Future work
Preliminary results show a modest improvement on
the baseline classifier. This means that the semi-
supervised algorithms have identified relevant dis-
ambiguated instances to be added to the training set.
We plan to evaluate the performance of these al-
gorithms on all the ambiguous words available in the
MSH WSD set. In addition, since the results have
shown that performance decreases rapidly after few
iterations, we would like to further explore smooth-
ing techniques applied to bootstrapping algorithms
and the effect on classifiers other than NB.
