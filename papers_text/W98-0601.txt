We address the representation of nouns hav- 
ing complex argument structures like deverbal 
nominalisations. In particular we address the 
semantic representation f syntactically unex- 
pressed arguments.We put forward a treatment 
of this kind of optional complements in a frame- 
work that combines HPSG syntax and the se- 
mantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995). 
1 In t roduct ion  
In this paper we address the representation f 
nouns having complex argument structures like 
deverbal nominalisations (and other nouns with 
complements). These classes of nominals very 
often appear in the surface string without their 
complements, even if they are semantically im- 
plied. Such semantic implications are often 
shown in discourse, so that anaphoric references 
cannot be accounted for without taking them 
into account. We put forward a treatment of 
unexpressed complements o nouns in a frame- 
work that combines HPSG syntax and the se- 
mantic approach in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995). 
In the next section we present some data con- 
cerning the semantic implications of syntacti- 
cally unexpressed complements. Our data are 
basically from Catalan, but the discussion is 
clearly applicable to other languages including 
English. In the third section we discuss the de- 
ficiencies of the standard treatments of option- 
ality of complements. Finally, in section four 
we put forward our proposal. We concentrate 
on the representation f deverbal nominalisa- 
tions, but we discuss some other kinds of op- 
tional complements o nouns. 
2 Data  
Most predicative nouns (i.e., those having com- 
plements) may or may not have their comple- 
merits present in the sentence. 1 In other words 
most complements o nouns are optional (in an 
appropriate context): 2

well 
Of course optionality of complements i  not 
limited to nominal complements: it is pervasive 
among verbal complements a well. Even within 
the context of verbal complements he discus- 
sions in the literature show that the distinctions 
between classes of complements are far from ob- 
vious. At the simplest level a twofold distinction 
1Here and throughout this paper we use the term 
"predicative noun" to refer to nouns that can have com- 
plements, thus including deverbal nd adjectival nomi- 
nalisatioas and relational nouns. 
2In the following a-examples the complements of 
nouns that are omitted in the b-examples are written 
in bold face. Note that the contexts usually have to be 
different. 
may be proposed between (obligatory) comple- 
ments and (optional) adjuncts. This however 
does not comply with the facts since it groups 
together very different classes of optionality: 
grammatically induced elision (4), optionality 
with semantic implications (5), as a pure ad- 
junct (6)... 3

These very simple examples how that the 
presence or absence of complements o predica- 
tive heads is not uniform from a semantic point 
of view. There are complements which are se- 
mantically external to the predication, whereas 
there are others that are internal (that is to say, 
that contribute some entity to the relation de- 
noted by the predication). And complements 
may or may not be present according to their se- 
mantic relation to the head. Most external com- 
plements (i.e., adjuncts) are always optional: 
they may be present or absent irrespective of 
their particular elation. 4 But there are many 
internal complements hat can be optional and 
some cannot be present except under very spe- 
cific circumstances; these are the complements 
described as default- and shadow-arguments re-
spectively in Pustejovsky (1995:63f): 
3Some authors have proposed a graded classification 
consisting of 5 to 7 classes (Somers, 1987). 
4However there are a few cases where one might want 
to say that there are obligatory adjuncts, as for example 
in: this suit washes easily. 
(7) a. D-Arg: John built the house out of 
bricks 
b. S-Arg: Mary buttered her toast with an 
expensive butter 
When dealing with a purely syntactic gram- 
mar (or lexical representation) all these as- 
pects boil down to determine the degree of op- 
tionality of the complement and to deal with 
the variation in syntactic behaviour accord- 
ingly. That is to say in many implementations 
of syntax some optionalities are dealt with by 
general rules or principles (this is clearly the 
case of the optionality of the logical subject, 
which is either accounted for by a passivisa- 
tion/impersonalisation rule of the grammar or 
by a lexical operation) and some are accounted 
for by listing them as different entries (or just 
as subentries of the same entry). But except for 
the cases where a grammatical relation clearly 
exists that applies to most lexical items of a 
particular class (as passivisation to transitives), 
the optionality of complements is dealt with by 
listing all the options in the dictionary. Further- 
more such a treatment does not include some 
of the complements hat are allowed only un- 
der certain very specific circumstances (e.g. D- 
Arg, S-Arg) since these can only be spelt out 
in semantic terms. 
Not surprisingly the application of these no- 
tions of obligatory and optional complements 
(developed for VPs and Ss) to NPs has not been 
successful: too many arguments in the NP are 
optional and there is too little grammatical con- 
trol (such as the one we find in passivisation) 
for general, syntactically based treatments to 
be successful. Note that even the simple dis- 
tinction between objective and subjective com- 
plements cannot be made operative on syntac- 
tic terms in Catalan and other languages (i.e., 
without taking into account heir semantics):

the study of the plants 
b. la soluci6 dels estudiants 
the solution of-the students 
c. 1' avaluaci6 dels inspectors 
the evaluation of-the inspectors 
But in addition there are strong reasons to 
consider that a semantic approach has to be 
taken to predicate-complement representation 
if we consider discourse factors, such as coher- 
ence, anaphora and the recovering of implica- 
tions. Consider the following examples: 
(9) a. La decoraci5 del pont

Have(l-p) dressed the salad and it(ac) 
hem hagut de llenqar perque 
have(l-p) hat to throw-away because 
l' oli era ranci 
the oil was rancid 
These examples how that complements not 
explicitly present in the NP or VP can be re- 
ferred to or implied in discourse. Of course the 
subject of acabada (9a) and natural  (9b and 9c) 
is only recoverable as the result of the decorat- 
ing and translat ing act respectively; and the use 
of definite specifiers el seu and I in (9d) and (9e) 
is allowed by the "hidden" complement of mare 
and amanir .  
3 Standard  t reatment  in  a rgument  
s t ructure  
The standard treatment of syntactically ori- 
ented representations introduces ome level of 
abstract description of argument structure in 
syntax, so that  general grammatical  relations 
can be accounted for in a straightforward way. 
Thus, content relations can be stated between 
arguments and their heads that differ from the 
surface syntactic ones. In HPSG,  for example, 
control relations are expressed as coindexation 
between syntactic and argument values, in such 
a way that a single valence element realises two 
argument slots; and passive is (lexically) dealt 
with as a change in the correlation between va- 
lence elements and argument ones. 5 
But  this level where argument structure is 
usually represented is a direct project ion (al- 
though neither simple, nor one-to-one) of the 
surface structure. That  is to say there are dif- 
ficulties in incorporating new argument slots 
when no correponding syntactic slot exists. And 
this is so simply because the argument values 
are not thought as full semantic representations 
but simply as the deep representation f syntac- 
tic structure. 6 
Being syntactically oriented, the standard 
treatments of argument structure can only rep- 
resent the types of complements that  corre- 
pond to the simple twofold dist inction men- 
tioned in the previous section: strongly re- 
stricted obligatory complements and optional 
adjuncts. ~Nonetheless, there are at least three 
aspects that are not considered in a satisfac- 
tory way: complements to verbs and to nouns 
which are not linked with a strong syntact ic and 
semantic relation, but cannot be treated as or- 
dinary adjuncts, i.e., intersectively (as for in- 
stance the kind of complements mentioned in 
footnote 4); complements to nouns generally, 
because they usually are optional (as in (1) 
to (3) above); and some complements to verbs 
which are manifestly optional (as in (5)). This is 
so because in the standard typing of arguments 
5Recall that the syntactic valence is expressed in 
HPSG as a list of descriptions ofthe complements which 
include their semantics, and that the argument struc- 
ture is obtained by coindexing the semantic part of that 
description with the appropriate argument slot. 
6In HPSG there is some ambiguity here, since the 
argument structure is embedded within the content part 
of the sign, where a lot of terminolgy is used that comes 
from situation semantics. 
7In HPSG for example the representation forthe for- 
met is strictly based on the coindexation between syntac- 
tic and argument values, whereas the treatment for the 
latter assumes an event structure for predication and in- 
tersects itwith the optional adjunts (see Badia & Colom- 
inas (1996)). 
there is no way to introduce arguments (or other 
kind of slots) that are not induced syntactically 
(or grammatically) in a restrictive way. A full 
theory of lexical semantics is needed to do so in 
a consistent way. For example, in Badia (1997) 
a particular case is considered and solved in an 
ad hoc way: the nominal translation (as in 9b 
above) is said to have an extra argument (to 
those inherited from the verb) so that its re- 
sult reading can have its denotation properly 
derived. This of course is only adequate for a 
small class of the complements we have here in 
mind (see examples in (8) and (9) above) and 
does not derive from a general theory of argu- 
ment structure. 
Such optional complements have only been 
treated in standard treatments by creating dis- 
tinct lexical entries, where the omitted com- 
plement is either just not present in the argu- 
ment structure representation r represented by 
an abstract existential quantification (without a 
correspondence to any syntactically realised el- 
ement). However this treatment neither eflects 
the relation between the different lexical entries 
that exist for a single word, nor is adequate in 
avoiding lexical redundancy. An alternative op- 
tion that could be considered is to treat those 
complements as adjuncts. However the treat- 
ment of adjuncts has not been fully developed 
yet, so that most of the proposals at hand are 
only adequate for intersective adjuncts. 8 
Furthermore, complements o nouns are par- 
ticularly difficult. From a semantic (and argu- 
ment structure) point of view many of them are 
like complements to verbs, in that they con- 
tribute entities to the relation denoted by the 
noun; thus an adequate treatment might intro- 
duce a particular number of arguments for ev- 
ery relation class denoted by nouns (just as it is 
done for verbs) (Badia & Colominas, 1996). But 
from the syntactic point of view the difficulty 
arises because they cannot be simply introduced 
in the valence lists (as verbal complements are). 
And a simple treatment as adjuncts is not very 
satisfactory either since it would increase the 
complexity of the semantic alculations. 
8Non intersective adjuncts cannot be easily treated, 
particularly those that contribute a new entity involved 
in the relation denoted by the predicate (for some 
of them quite complex proposals have been developed 
within HPSG: e.g., Kaspers, 1994). 
4 Proposed  t reatment  
In the following we attempt o account for some 
optional complements of predicative nouns in 
HPSG, by enlarging the semantic information 
and representing these complements in an in- 
formation level distinct from the valence lists. 
With regards to our semantic representation 
proposal, we maintain the referential informa- 
tion level in HPSG, expressed by means of the 
INDEX attribute. However we follow Puste- 
jovsky (1995) in enriching the argument struc- 
ture information level (expressed in HPSG as 
the RESTRICTION attribute and adapted here as 
ARGUMENT-STRUCTURE (ARGSTR)), SO that D- 
and S-Args can be represented (in addition to 
the strictly obligatory ones). Furthermore we 
also introduce the EVENT-STRUCTURE (EVSTR) 
and QUALIA levels of information estipulated in 
Pustejovsky (1995). The latter describes the 
lexical semantics of the entity and its related ar- 
guments, whereas the former displays the event 
properties of the expressed eventuality. As will 
be seen below, the argument structure level acts 
as interface between the mechanisms that allow 
for the syntactic realisation of the complements 
and the rich lexical semantics -constituted by 
the EVSTR and QUALIA levels. 9
Let us now consider the syntactic treatment 
of D- and S-Args. Due to their optionality, the 
HPSG standard treatment of obligatory com- 
plements by means of valence lists is not ade- 
quate for them. Nonetheless a recent proposal 
by Sanfilippo (1998) gives a good insight into 
how they can be treated. For independent rea- 
sons he proposes that some complements are 
treated as real adjuncts from a syntactic point 
of view, even if they are thematically bound to 
the relation denoted by the head. We adopt 
this mechanism and represent D- and S-Args as 
thematically bound adjuncts, introduced as set 
members at the nonlocal (NONLOC) information 
level. Thus the basic structure of the sign is as 
follows: l? 
9In fact our implementation follows the lines devel- 
oped by Copestake (1992), Johnston (1996), among oth- 
ers. Particularly we follow the formalisation of Puste- 
jovsky's semantics in feature structures developed in 
Johnston (1996). In his treatment the selection of the ap- 
propriate reading in aspectually-based v rbal polysemies 
is expressed by means of a boolean value in the head at- 
tribute of each of the relevant qualia (see figures below).

Consider firstly an ordinary process-result 
nominal such as construccid ('building'). It is a 
nominalization from the verb construir ('build'), 
which subcategorises for two obligatory comple- 
ments: the agent and the result of the building 
process. 
As indicated in Pustejovsky (1995) this verb 
has also a third argument expressing the ma- 
terial, a D-Are, which is syntactically optional 
but participates in the logical expression of the 
event (see example (7a) above). In the rep- 
resentation for that verb (figure 1), the first 
two complements are expressed in the valence 
lists, whereas the latter is treated according to 
Sanfilippo's proposal for thematically bound ad- 
juncts; that is, as a member at the nonlocal in- 
formation level. In figure (2) we show the pro- 
cess nominalisation of construir where not only 
the D-Are but also ARG1 and ARG2 are not de- 
clared in the valence lists but included in the 
nonlocal set. Recall that we treat them like D- 
Ares. 
For our implementation we use LKB (Copes- 
take, 1993). We first derive the process reading 
of the nominal from the verbal exical entry: the 
nominal representation for the process reading 
(in figure 2) is obtained by (non-locally) inher- 
iting from the already existing lexical entry of 
the verb (in figure 1). 11 And secondly the lex- 
ical entry for the result sense of construcci6 is 
created by means of a lexical rule that replaces 
the EVSTR head value and removes the ARG2 
attribute, the value of which is now declared 
as the index value. ARG2 has to be removed 
since, as it expresses the entity resulting from 
tribute in the rest of the structures in the paper. 
nThis is expressable in LKB by using the verbal 
lexical entry as a pseudo-sort (psort) (see Copestake 
(1993:23)).

Thus the treatment of optional complements 
of nominalizations is identical to the treatment 
assigned to D-Ares of verbs. Both kinds of ar- 
gument are logically implied by the semantics 
of the predicate (verb or noun) but are syntac- 
tically optional. They are distinguished from 
Pustejovsky's True-Arguments (T-Arg) - that 
is, the syntactically realized parameters of the 
lexical items (Pustejovsky, 1995:63)- by means 
of the syntactic level at which they are declared: 
in the valence list or in the set of nonlocal ele- 
ments.

fer from standard creation predicates in that 
their process reading cannot express syntacti- 
cally the argument denoted by the result nomi- 
nalization. 
Consider the noun decoracig ('decoration'), 
derived from the verb decorar ('decorate'). We 
start by assuming three arguments o that pred- 
icate: a first one corresponding to the agent, a 
second one that expresses the theme (i.e., the 
object being decorated), and finally a D-Arg 
referring to the material. The agent and the 
theme arguments are subcategorized as T-Args 
by the verb, but realized as thematically bound 
adjuncts when appearing in a nominalization. 
As opposed to construir, the direct object of 
decorar does not denote the object resulting 
from the decoration act, but the object being 
decorated. As a consequence both nominalisa-

complement that corresponds to the direct ob- 
ject of the verb (recall that this is not possible 
in the case of result readings of creation predi- 
cates). Therefore the presence of the objective 
complement of decoraci6 is not useful for dis- 
ambiguating between the two readings. Thus 
nominalizations like construcci6 and decoraci6 
with the objective complement differ in that the 
first one does not accept he two possible senses 
appearing together, while the second one does. 
Following the treatment of Pustejovsky's dot- 
ted types in Buitelaar (1997), this fact leads us 
to conceive construccid as an open dotted type, 
and decoracid as a closed dotted type.

Figure 4: traduccid 
shown in figure (3). Note that it is adequate 
to deal with facts such as the ones exemplified 
in (9a). In this example the redescription omi- 
nal (decoraci6) expresses the process reading in 
the first clause, and in the second one it is re- 
ferred to as denoting the object resulting from 
the process. In the representation of the nomi- 
nal decoraci6 in figure (3) this is allowed by the 
third argument of the AGENTIVE qualia, which 
is not bound by any argument in the ARGSTR, 
just because it cannot be syntactically realised 
in any case as an argument. Note that argument 
structure acts as an interface between the rich 
semantic representation (i.e., the QUALIA and 
EVSTR structures) and the surface mechanisms 
that allow for complements of the predicate (va- 
lence lists and non-local set). Only semantic ar- 
guments that may be syntactically realised are 
present in the argument structure (either as T- 
Args or as D- or S-Args). On the other hand the 
7 
rich semantic structure allows to express eman- 
tically implied arguments, and thus provides a 
treatment for semantically motivated iscourse 
factors (such as the ones shown in (9) above). 
The proposal outlined here provides an ap- 
propriate treatment for the traducci6 example 
(9b). Instead of the ad hoc solution adopted in 
Badia (1997) the treatment proposed here de- 
rives from a general and systematic approach to 
the semantic structure of predicates and their 
nominalisations. To make things concrete we 
present in figure (4) the full lexical entry of the 
process reading of the nominal traduccid. This 
representation is able to deal with anaphoric ref- 
erence to the unexpressed result semantic argu- 
ment of the process reading (9b). Note that 
a parallel verbal lexical entry also gives an ac- 
count of the anaphoric relation allowed by the 
verb traduir in (9c), and that a similar treat- 
ment is applicable to the verbs menjar and 
amanir of examples (5) and (9e). 
Of course this treatment applies in a general 
way to other redescription predicates, like es- 
tudi ('study'), soluci6 ('solution') and avaluaci6 
('evaluation') in (8). Notice as well that the rich 
semantic information we use allows us to deal 
in a natural way with the distinction between 
subjective and objective complements in these 
data. In (Sa), for instance, estudi does not allow 
plantes ('plants') as the agent of the event since 
tha agent has to be an animate individual: 13 
Other types of nouns with semantically im- 
plied (optional) complements can be similarly 
treated; for example non deverbal nouns that 
express a relation with another entity, like 
nouns denoting partition or sets (full 'sheet' in 
(2) and grup 'group' in (3)) or relational nouns 
(mare 'mother' in (9d)). The arguments of full 
or grup can be treated as D-Args because they 
are not strictly obligatory but their semantics 
is implied. However the semantics of the syn- 
tactically realised complement need not corre- 
spond exactly to the semantic implication. For 
example, the implication of .full realised with- 
out a complement is that it is a piece of paper; 
however the complement may denote any sim-

EVSTR and QUALIA levels are underspecified, similarly to 
the value of the INDEX attribute, thus letting the entry

ilar class of material (card, cardboard, tissue 
paper...) (Sauri, 1998). We account for this 
difference by means of a lexical rule that over- 
writes the implied semantics of the complement 
when necessary. 
This treatment however is not adequate for 
relational nouns, like mare ('mother') or pare 
('father'). These nouns do not allow the surface 
realisation of the semantic implication unless it 
is more specific:

*Has come the father of a son 
b. Ha vingut el pare d' un nen 
Has come the father of a boy

c. Ha vingut el pare de la Joana

This kind of complement can be seen as 
shadow arguments (S-Arg) of Pustejovsky's. In 
our proposal they are treated as D-Args because 
they are optional: their syntactic realisation is 
controlled via the non-local set and the semantic 
implication is expressed in the FORMAL qualia. 
However a restriction has to be formulated upon 
the semantics of the syntactic element within 
the non-local set: namely that it be more spe- 
cific than the semantic implication (see figure 
(6)). 14

In this paper we have discussed the represen- 
tation of the semantic structure of nominals 
having complex argument structures. In par- 
ticular we have proposed a treatment for syn- 
tactically unexpressed optional complements of
nouns. We have shown the relevance of the 
representation f such relations (based on dis- 
course factors) and have developed a treatment 
that takes into account both the syntactic and 
the semantic aspects of the phenomenon. In 
particular we have shown that optional com- 
plements of deverbal nominalizations and other 
classes of nouns (in addition of some optional 
complements o verbs) can be nicely dealt with 
by using Pustejovsky's D- and S-Args being im- 
plemented as thematically bound adjuncts in 
an HPSG framework semantically enriched fop 
lowing the lines in GL. This is possible mainly

specific) in the feature structure below. We are currently 
working on an implementation f this restriction. 
thanks to the interface role between syntax and 
lexical semantic information that is performed 
by the argument structure level. Our proposal 
has been implemented by using LKB devices 
which allow a general and systematic treatment.
