Abstract
We analyze the linguistic behaviour of par-
ticipants in bilateral electronic negotiations,
and discover that particular language char-
acteristics are in contrast with face-to-face
negotiations. Language patterns in the later
part of electronic negotiation are highly in-
dicative of the successful or unsuccessful
outcome of the process, whereas in face-to-
face negotiations, the first part of the nego-
tiation is more useful for predicting the out-
come. We formulate our problem in terms of
text classification on negotiation segments
of different sizes. The data are represented
by a variety of linguistic features that cap-
ture the gist of the discussion: negotiation-
or strategy-related words. We show that,
as we consider ever smaller final segments
of a negotiation transcript, the negotiation-
related words become more indicative of the
negotiation outcome, and give predictions
with higher Accuracy than larger segments
from the beginning of the process.
1 Introduction
We use language every day to convince, explain, ma-
nipulate and thus reach our goals. This aspect of
language use is even more obvious in the context
of negotiations. The parties must reach an agree-
ment on the partitioning or sharing of a resource,
while each party usually wants to leave the negotia-
tion table with the larger piece of the pie. These ten-
dencies become stronger when negotiators use only
electronic means to communicate, that is to say, par-
ticipate in electronic negotiations. In face-to-face
contact, prosody and body language often have a
crucial role in conveying attitudes and feelings. E-
negotiators, on the other hand, must rely only on
texts. We perform automatic analysis of the textual
data in e-negotiations. We identify linguistic expres-
sions of such negotiation-specific behaviour that are
indicative of the final outcome of the process ? suc-
cess or failure ? and observe how powerful a tool
language is in helping people get what they want.
In this paper we focus on the negotiation as an on-
going process. We analyze the linguistic features of
messages exchanged at various points in the course
of the negotiation, to determine the time frame in
which the outcome becomes decided. From our ex-
perimental point of view, we determine the segment
of the negotiation which is most predictive of the
outcome. There is an imposed three-week deadline
in the electronic negotiations that we analyze. We
hypothesize that the pressure of the deadline is re-
flected in the messages exchanged. The messages
written later in the process are more indicative of
the outcome of the process. Our empirical results
support this hypothesis; an analysis of the linguis-
tic features that make this prediction possible shows
what the negotiators? main concerns are as the dead-
line draws near.
Here is what our results contribute to the field
of text analysis. Research on text records of face-
to-face negotiations suggests that the language pat-
terns used in the first half of a negotiation predict
the negotiation outcome better than those in the sec-
ond half (Simons, 1993). The explanation was that
257
in the first phase people establish contact, exchange
personal information and engage in general polite
conversation, creating a foundation of trust between
partners. No numerical data, however, supported
this diagnosis, and there was no distinction between
the prediction of successful and unsuccessful out-
comes. When it comes to text classification, our
hypothesis says that the classification of the second
parts of e-negotiation texts is more accurate with re-
spect to the outcome than the classification of the
first parts. This makes e-negotiation texts different
from newsgroup messages, newspaper articles and
other documents classified by Blatak et al (2004),
where texts showe d better classification Accuracy
on their initial parts. We report the results of several
sets of Machine Learning (ML) experiments. Per-
formed on varying-size text data segments, they sup-
port our hypothesis.
We worked with a collection of transcripts of
negotiations conducted over the Internet using the
Web-based negotiation support system Inspire (Ker-
sten and Zhang, 2003). Kersten and Zhang (2003)
and Nastase (2006) classified e-negotiation out-
comes using non-textual data. Classification based
on texts is discussed in (Sokolova et al 2005;
Sokolova and Szpakowicz, 2006). None of those ex-
periments considered segmenting the data, although
Sokolova and Szpakowicz (2006) analyzed the im-
portance of the first part of e-negotiations. The work
we present here is the first attempt to investigate the
effect of parts of e-negotiation textual data on classi-
fication quality. In this study we do not report types
of expressions that are relevant to success and failure
of negotiations. These expressions have been pre-
sented and analyzed in (Sokolova and Szpakowicz,
2005).
In section 2 we take a brief look at other work on
the connection between behaviour and language. In
section 3 we present our data and their representa-
tion for ML experiments, and we further motivate
our work. Section 4 describes the experiments. We
discuss the results in Section 5. Section 6 draws con-
clusions and discusses a few ideas for future work.
2 Background Review
Young (1991) discusses the theory that the situation
in which language is used affects the way in which it
is used. This theory was illustrated with a particular
example of academic speech.
The field of neuro-linguistic programming in-
vestigates how to program our language (among
other things) to achieve a goal. In the 1980s,
Rodger Bailey developed the Language and Be-
haviour Profile based on 60 meta-programs. Charvet
(1997) presents a simplified approach with 14 meta-
programs. This profile proposes that people?s lan-
guage patterns are indicators of behavioural pref-
erences. In the study of planning dialogues (Chu-
Carroll and Carberry, 2000), Searle?s theory of
speech acts used through the discourse analysis also
supports the fact that language carries much of peo-
ple?s behaviour and emotions. Reitter and Moore
(2007) studied repetitions in task-oriented conver-
sations. They demonstrated that a speaker?s short-
term ability to copy the interlocutor?s syntax is au-
tonomous from the success of the task, whereas
long-term adaptation varies with such success.
We consider a negotiation to be a communication
in which the participants want to reach an agreement
relative to the splitting/sharing of resources. Lan-
guage is one of the tools used to reach the goal. We
propose that not all messages exchanged throughout
a negotiation have the same effect on the negotiation
outcome. To test this hypothesis, we take an ever
smaller segment of the negotiation, and see howwell
we can predict the outcome of the process, based
only on the messages in this fragment.
We encountered several challenges in predict-
ing e-negotiation outcomes using the messages ex-
changed. First, electronic negotiations usually do
not have a sequential-stage model of behaviour
(Koeszegi et al 2007), which is common in face-
to-face negotiations (Adair and Brett, 2005). Here is
an example of behavioural phases in face-to-face ne-
gotiations: Perform Relational Positioning ? Iden-
tify the Problem ? Generate Solutions ? Reach
Agreement. Unexpected turns and moves ? typical
of human behaviour ? make prediction of the ne-
gotiation outcome difficult. In case of electronic
negotiation, the absence of the usual negotiation
structure further complicates the outcome predic-
tion. This distinguishes e-negotiations from agent-
customer phone conversations studied in (Takeuchi
et al 2007), where an agent follows the call flow
pre-defined by his company?s policy.
258
The longer an e-negotiation takes, the more elab-
orate the structure of the e-negotiation process be-
comes. Simpler e-negotiation may involve an ex-
change of well-structured business documents such
as pre-defined contract or retail transactions. A
more complex process comprises numerous offers
and counter-offers and has a high degree of uncer-
tainty because of the possible unpredictability of ne-
gotiation moves.
The next challenge stems from the limitations im-
posed by the use of electronic means. This overloads
text messages with various tasks: negotiation issues
themselves, introductions and closures traditional in
negotiations, and even socializing. On the other
hand, electronic means make the contacts less for-
mal, allowing people to communicate more freely.
As a result, the data have a high volume of informal-
ity such as abbreviations or slang.
The last challenge is specific to text analysis. E-
negotiations usually involve a multi-cultural audi-
ence of varied background, many of whom are not
native English speakers. While communicating in
English, they introduce a fair amount of spelling and
grammatical mistakes.
3 Textual Data in Electronic Negotiations
Participants in a negotiation assume well-defined
roles (such as buyers/sellers in some business nego-
tiations, or facilitators in legal disputes), have goals,
and adopt specific behaviour to achieve those goals
(Koeszegi et al 2007). These circumstances are re-
flected in the language of texts exchanged in negoti-
ations, and distinguish this type of texts from casual
e-mail exchange and postings on discussion groups
and chat boards. We claim that the language cap-
tured in e-negotiation textual data changes as a nego-
tiation progresses, and that this is clearly detectable,
even though it does not follow a sequential-stage
model common in face-to-face-negotiations (Adair
and Brett, 2005) or an agent-customer interaction
call flow recommended by a company (Takeuchi et
al, 2007). To support the language change hypothe-
sis, we have conducted a series of ML experiments
on negotiation segments of varying size and posi-
tion, using the largest available data of electronic ne-
gotiations.
Our data come from the Web-based negoti-
ation support system Inspire. Inspire has been
used in business courses to teach students about
e-negotiations and give them a chance to practice
bilateral business negotiations conducted in a lightly
controlled environment. For many users, conducting
negotiations has been a business/ course assignment.
Other users wanted to develop their English skills
by participating in an Inspire-enabled negotiation.
A negotiation would last up to three weeks, after
which, if an agreement has not been reached, the
systems would terminate the negotiation and record
it as unsuccessful. The following is an example of a
negotiation message (with the original spelling):
Dear Georg, I hope you are doig well. I send you this message
to ask you what happened to our offer. Just be aware that
we will not be indifinitely waiting on your response. As I
told you during our last meeting, Itex Manufacturing needs
a partnership. So it is important to me to know if you are
ready to negotiate with us. We can not afford losing so much
precious time. We give you now five more days to answer
our offer (1st of december 1997, 2400 Swiss time). After this
dead line, will propose our services to your concurrence. I
still believe in a good partnership and relationship between
our two societies. Let me know if you think so. For Itex
Manufacturing. Rookie.
Among the wealth of data gathered by Inspire, we
have focussed on the accompanying text messages,
extracted from the transcripts of 2557 negotiations.
Each negotiation had two different participants, and
one person participated in only one negotiation. The
total number of contributors was over 5000; most
of them were not native English speakers. The data
contain 1, 514, 623 word tokens and 27, 055 types.
Compared with benchmark corpora, for example the
Brown or the Wall Street Journal corpus (Francis
and Kucera, 1997; Paul and Baker, 1992), this col-
lection has a lower type-token ratio and a higher
presence of content words among the most frequent
words (this is typical of texts on a specific topic), and
a high frequency of singular first- and second-person
pronouns (this is typical of dialogues).
We considered all messages from one negotiation
to be a single negotiation text. We concatenated the
messages in chronological order, keeping the punc-
tuation and spelling unedited. Each negotiation had
a unique label, either positive or negative, and was
a training example in one of two classes ? success-

ful or unsuccessful. Inspire assigned a negotiation
to the right class automatically. 55% of negotiations
in our data set were successful, i.e. ended up with
agreement.
We represented a complete negotiation, or text as
we consider it, as a combined bag of words. We
matched the tokens in the messages with an inven-
tory of domains from Longman Dictionary of Con-
temporary English (Procter, 1978). This allowed us
to select those terms that refer to negotiation specific
issues ? we call them negotiation-related words. We
select strategic words based on words and patterns
that literature shows to express the intentions, influ-
ence, self-obligations and motivations of the negoti-
ation participants. In classifying successful and un-
successful negotiations, subsets of these two types
of features provided better Accuracy than statisti-
cally selected features, e.g. most frequent unigrams
and unigrams with a higher log-likelihood values
calculated between positive and negative classes
(Sokolova et al 2005).
We halved each text, that is to say, the complete
record of a negotiation. For each half we built a
bag of 123 negotiation-related words ? more on this
in section 4. The binary attributes represented the
presence or absence of the word in its half of the
text. We concatenated the two bags, and labelled
the resulting bag by the outcome of the whole ne-
gotiation: positive if the negotiation was successful,
negative otherwise. We repeated this procedure for
the split of the negotiation text into 34 and
1
4 . Our
ML tools were Weka?s (Witten and Frank, 2005)
NAIVE BAYES (NB), the sequential minimal optimiza-
tion (SVM) version of SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, and
DECISION TREE (DT). In Table 1 we report Accuracy
and Precision (P ), Recall (R) and F ? score (F ).
P , R, F are calculated on the positive class. For
every classifier, the best Accuracy and correspond-
ing P , R, F are reporte d; we performed an exhaus-
tive search on adjustable parameters; the evaluation
method was tenfold cross-validation. Our Accuracy
results are comparable with those reported in pre-
vious studies (Kersten and Zhang, 2003; Nastase,
2006; Sokolova and Szpakowicz, 2006).
We used the paired t-test to generalize the results
on both splits.1 The two-tailed P value was 0.0102.
By conventional criteria, this difference is consid-
ered to be statistically significant.
Accuracy and, especially, Precision results show
that DECISION TREE is sensitive to the positions of
words in different parts of the negotiations. SUPPORT
VECTOR MACHINE and NAIVE BAYES change Accuracy
only slightly. The Precision and Recall results
give a better picture of the performance. The
presence/absence of words recorded for different
splits of negotiations influences the identification of
true positive examples (successful negotiations) and
true negative examples (unsuccessful negotiations).
Recall displays that DT classifies successful negoti-
ations better when the negotiations are split 12 and
1
2 .
Precision andRecall together imply that unsuccess-
ful negotiations have a higher rate of true classifica-
tion achieved by NB, when the split is 34 and
1
4 . This
split lets us improve the worst rates of true classifi-
cations ? unsuccessful negotiations for DT and suc-
cessful negotiations for NB. Generally, the unequal
split al lows us to reduce the difference between true
positive and true negative classification results, and
thus makes the classification of negotiations more
balanced than the equal split. For all the three clas-
sifiers, Accuracy and F ? score are better on the 34
and 14 split.
4 The Empirical Set-up
We wanted to determine the placement of the seg-
ment of a negotiation most important in deciding
whether the outcome is positive: at the beginning
or at the end of the process. To do that, we split each
negotiation in half, and built two parallel data sets,
corresponding to the two halves. We classified each

260
part using various ML tools. Next, we repeated the
same classification tasks using smaller and smaller
final segments, in order to monitor the variation in
performance. Thus each negotiation text N con-
sisted of the head segment (h) and the tail segment
(t): N = h
?
t, h
?
t = ?, where |t| = |N |i and t was
the segment at the end of N , and |h| = (i?1)|N |i cov-
ering the beginning of the negotiation. We stopped
when for two consecutive splits two classifiers had
better Accuracy on the head than on the tail. Each
segment got the same class label as the whole nego-
tiation.
For these experiments, as briefly explained in sec-
tion 3, we took the textual negotiation data repre-
sented as bags of words. Because of the large num-
ber of word features (27, 055 tokens), we performed
lexical feature selection.
Statistical analysis of the corpus built from the
Inspire negotiation messages has revealed that the
issues discussed in these messages can be grouped
into a small set of topics. The particular topic
or domain to which a word belongs derives from
the most frequent bigram and trigram meanings;
for instance, the second most frequent trigram
with the word delivery is payment upon delivery, so
we assign delivery to the domain negotiation process.
The data come from negotiations on a specific
topic (sale/purchase of bicycle parts), so a likely
candidate subset would be words related to it. We
select such negotiation-related words as the first
set of features. We show a text sample with the
negotiation-related words in bold:
Dear Georg, I hope you are doig well. I send you this message
to ask you what happened to our offer. Just be aware that
we will not be indifinitely waiting on your response. As I
told you during our last meeting, Itex Manufacturing needs
a partnership. So it is important to me to know if you are
ready to negotiatewith us. We can not afford losing so much
precious time. We give you now five more days to answer our
offer (1st of december 1997, 2400 Swiss time). After this
dead line, we will propose our services to your concurrence.
I still believe in a good partnership and relationship between
our two societies. Let me know if you think so. For Itex
Manufacturing. Rookie.
Strategies which the negotiators adopt (promises,
threats, exchange of information, argumentation,
and so on) affect the outcome (Sokolova and
Szpakowicz, 2006). Since the messages are dense,
short and grammatically simple, the expression of
strategies through language is straightforward and
concentrates on communicating the main goal. The
word categories that convey negotiators? strategies
are modals, personal pronouns, volition verbs,
mental verbs; we refer to them as strategic words.
Strategic words constitute the second set of features.
Our text sample with strategic words in bold looks
as follows:
Dear Georg, I hope you are doig well. I send you this mes-
sage to ask you what happened to our offer. Just be aware
that we will not be indifinitely waiting on your response. As
I told you during our last meeting, Itex Manufacturing needs
a partnership. So it is important to me to know if you are
ready to negotiate with us. We can not afford losing so much
precious time. We give you now five more days to answer
our offer (1st of december 1997, 2400 Swiss time). After
this dead line, we will propose our services to your concur-
rence. I still believe in a good partnership and relationship
between our two societies. Let me know if you think so.

We work with kernel (SVM), decision-based (DT)
and probabilistic (NB) classifiers. Applying classi-
fiers with different working paradigms allow us to
capture and understand different aspects of the data,
as the results and our discussion in section 5 will
show. For each classifier, we used tenfold cross-
validation and exhaustive search on adjustable pa-
rameters in model selection. The best results, in par-
ticular with high overall Accuracy , appear in Fig-
ure 1.
When the data are represented using negotiation-
related words, the tail segments give more accurate
outcome classification than the head segments. This
holds for all splits and all classifiers; see Figure 1.
The increase in Accuracy when the head segments
grow was to be expected, although it does not hap-
pen with DT and SVM ? only with NB. At the same
time, there is no monotonic decline in Accuracy
when the length of the tail segments decreases. On
the contrary, NB constantly improves the Accuracy
of the classification. We note the fact that NB in-
creases theAccuracy on both head and tail segments
and makes the basic assumption of the conditional
independence of features. We explain the NB re-
sults by the decreased dependence between the pres-

baseline Accuracy of 55%.
Figure 1. SVM classifies all tail segments better
than head segments, DT classifies tail segments bet-
ter than head segments up to the 45/
1
5 split, and NB
classifies the tail segment better than the head seg-
ment only for the half-and-half split. The Accuracy
results are unstable for all three classifiers, with the
Accuracy on the head segments decreasing when
the segments grow and the Accuracy on the tail
segments increasing when the tail segments shrink.
The performance of the classifiers indicate that, as
the deadline approaches, negotiation-related words
reflect the negotiation process better than strategic
words.
To investigate which part of the tail segments is
more important for classifying the outcomes, we in-
troduced additional splits in the tail segments. We
divided the second half of each text into 2 and 3
parts and repeated the classification procedures for
every new split. The results appear at the top of
Table 2, where tail shows the classification results
when the second half of the text was classified, and
the other columns report the results on the tail splits;
both splits satisfy the conditions tail =

i si, where
si
?
sj = ? for every i 6= j.
The results show that adding splits in the tail seg-
ments emphasizes the importance of the last part of
a negotiation. For negotiation-related word repre-
sentation, the classification of the outcome on the
last part of the tail is more accurate than on its other
parts. This holds for all three classifiers. For the
strategic-word representation the same is true for
SVM and partially for DT, but not for NB; see the
bottom of Table 2. NB classifies the negotiation out-
comes more accurately on s1 than on s2 and on s2
rather than s3.

5 Segmentation Results
Taking into account the results reported in section
4, we chose negotiation-related words as the feature
set. We selected for further analysis the half that per-
formed better for a majority of the tools used. We
focussed on the last part of the negotiation, and we
extracted a gradually smaller fragment (12 ?
1
9 ; 9 is
the average number of text messages in one negotia-
tion). Figure 2 plots the results of the experiments
performed with decreasing segment sizes. As we
see, the tail segment of the length 17 gave a decline
of the Accuracy for SVM and NB, with a slight im-
provement on smaller tail segments.
A more detailed analysis comes from consider-
ing the Precision and Recall results on the seg-
ments; see Table 3. On 17 and
1
9 tail segments a
higher Precision indicates that all classifiers have
improved the identification of true negatives (unsuc-
cessful negotiations). This means that the trends in
the class of unsuccessful negotiations become more
noticeable for the classifiers when the deadline ap-
proaches. The 18 split is an exception, with the
abrupt drop of true negative classification by DE-
CISION TREE. The correct classification of positive
examples (successful negotiations), however, dimin-
ishes when splits become smaller; this applies to the
performance of all three classifiers. This means that
at the end of the negotiations the class of success-
ful negotiations becomes more diverse and, subse-
quently, multi-modal, and the trends are more diffi-
cult to capture by the classifiers.
As in the previous experiments, NB?s Accuracy
on the tail segments is higher than on the complete
data. The opposite is true for SVM and DT: their
Accuracy on the tail segments is lower than on the
complete data. We explain this by the fact that the
sizes of tail segments in the last splits do not give
these two classifiers sufficient information.
6 Discussion and Future Work
We have analyzed textual messages exchanged in the
course of electronic negotiations. The results sup-
port our hypothesis that texts of electronic negoti-
ation have different characteristics than records of
face-to-face negotiation. In particular, messages ex-
changed later in the process are more informative
with regard to the negotiation outcome than mes-
sages exchanged at the beginning.
We represented textual records of negotiations by
two types of word features. These features cap-
ture the important aspects of the negotiation process
? negotiation-related concepts and indicators of the
strategies employed. We performed extensive exper-
iments with different types of ML algorithms and
segments of varying sizes from the beginning and
the end of the negotiation, on a collection of over
2500 electronic negotiations. Our study shows that
words expressing negotiation-related concepts are
more useful for distinguishing successful and failed
negotiations, especially towards the end of negotia-
tions. We also have shown that there is no linear de-
pendency between the segment sizes and Accuracy
of classification of the negotiation success and fail-
ure.
263
Our research plans include a continuation of the
investigation of the negotiators? behaviour in elec-
tronic negotiations and its reflection in language. To
see whether dialogue analysis improves prediction
of the negotiation outcomes, we will look at negotia-
tions as dialogues between participants and take into
account their roles, e.g. buyer and seller. We will
split a negotiation at message boundaries to avoid
