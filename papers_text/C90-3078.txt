ABSTRACT 
This note presents an overview of the 
English-Chinese Translalion System for 
Tourists (~I~q) currently under de- 
velopment at South China University of 
Technolo~/. A brief description of 
the bilingual dictionazv is given, 
followed by descriptions of grammar 
rules representation and the n~in 
processes involved in translation. 
S~TEM CONFiGUR&TIOR 
ECTST consists of a translation pro- 
gram, a bili,4Tual d ict ion~w and a 
rule-data base. The  program body is 
composed of a sequence of modules, 
performing translation in four phases: 
SL sentence 
Initiation ~ 
Tt, sentence 
The initiation pha~e is concerned with 
input of the SL sentence, diotionsry 
look-up and morphological processing. 
The analysis phase involves syntactic 
and semantic parsing, which are accom- 
plished through linguistic models and 
case frame. The transfer phase com- 
prises rules for converting the parsed 
SL sentence into the TL sentence. ~e  
generation phase, applying the con- 
tents obtained from the previous pro- 
cess, generates the TL sentence. 
ECTST is implemented in PASCAL. The 
software is separated from the lin- 
guistic data, so that any language can 
be accepted if the grammar rules and 
vocabulary are given. Likewise, the 
system program are free to o:hange 
their components with no undue res- 
trictions that may be imposed by the 
linguistic components. 
DIdTIONAP? ~,ONT~PFS 
The dictionary is bilingual: it con- 
tains morphological, syntactic and se- 
mantic information needed for the 
analysis and generation of a sentence. 
This includes information about the 
category of words, their semantic fea~ 
tures and case frames. Entries in %he 
lexicon are of eight types, and their 
semantic features are based on graded 
concepts. The case frame provides a 
means to find out the logical rela- 
tionship between components in the 
sentence. 
At present, the dictionary contains a 
limited set of lexical entries, which 
are grouped into models with the ini- 
tial letter as the index for access? 
GRAMMAR RUL~ 
In ECTST, rules are represented in the 
form of meta-model. It may contain 
one or more data items as shown below:

TRM~SFF~ AND GIi~i~I~ATiON 
In the transfer sta~e, transformation 
is accomplished in two steps" firs% 
the internal structure of the Fi, sen- 
teuoe is generated into a tree, with 
nodes that indicate their proper me- 
msntic and gr~r.atica\] order in th~ TL 
sentence; then lexicon rules arc in- 
voked to transfer the SL entrT- ~ on the 
basis of its context, in%o %he TL 
entry. The advantage of such a pro- 
cedure are obvious. It ~kes  the 
r~u\].es more flexib!e9 especially those 
oopin? S with sentences with similar in- 
t ernal s tructl/res. Moreover p ~ es 
can be added, modified or changed as 
needed with no resultant effect on one 
another. 
When a target tree is built up, it is 
then scanned by way of left recursion 
377 
and with words appended to its termi- 
nal nodes a~ required? Finally~ a 
oh~r~cter string is obta ined;  its out- 
put is ~ sentence in TL. 
CONCLUSION 
Efforts made over the past decade h~ve 
achieved co~miderable progress in 
machine translation. First syntactic 
parsing was pursued, then semantic and 
context analysis was advocated. ECTST 
has profited from both theories. 
Natural language is essentially 
discrete information system. It often 
al\]ows multiple syntactic interpret&- 
tions. To mini,~ize the possibility of 
multiple interpret~.tion, we introduce 
a mioimum amount of semantic informa- 
tion and .adopt the case frame. This 
provides flexible f~cility in .<vnt~c- 
tic analysis and helps to distinguish 
st~otura/ mmbiguity, in this ap- 
proach, the translation accuracy is up 
to 9C,~)~ or more, which can be raised if 
correspondzng i~'orn~ztion and/or rules 
are  modified ar/l supplemented.
