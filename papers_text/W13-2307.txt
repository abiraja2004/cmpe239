Abstract
We introduce a framework for lightweight
dependency syntax annotation. Our for-
malism builds upon the typical represen-
tation for unlabeled dependencies, per-
mitting a simple notation and annotation
workflow. Moreover, the formalism en-
courages annotators to underspecify parts
of the syntax if doing so would streamline
the annotation process. We demonstrate
the efficacy of this annotation on three lan-
guages and develop algorithms to evaluate
and compare underspecified annotations.
1 Introduction
Computational representations for natural lan-
guage syntax are borne of competing design con-
siderations. When designing such representations,
there may be a tradeoff between parsimony and
expressiveness. A range of linguistic theories at-
tract support due to differing purposes and aes-
thetic principles (Chomsky, 1957; Tesni?re, 1959;
Hudson, 1984; Sgall et al, 1986; Mel?c?uk, 1988,
inter alia). Formalisms concerned with tractable
computation may care chiefly about learnabil-
ity or parsing efficiency (Shieber, 1992; Sleator
and Temperly, 1993; Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006).
Further considerations may include psychologi-
cal and evolutionary plausibility (Croft, 2001;
Tomasello, 2003; Steels et al, 2011; Fossum and
Levy, 2012), integration with other representa-
tions such as semantics (Steedman, 2000; Bergen
and Chang, 2005), or suitability for particular ap-
plications (e.g., translation).
Here we elevate ease of annotation as a pri-
mary design concern for a syntactic annotation
formalism. Currently, a lack of annotated data
is a huge bottleneck for robust NLP, standing in
the way of parsers for social media text (Foster
et al, 2011) and many low-resourced languages
(to name two examples). Traditional syntactic an-
notation projects like the Penn Treebank (Marcus
?Corresponding author: nschneid@cs.cmu.edu
et al, 1993) or Prague Dependency Treebank (Ha-
jic?, 1998) require highly trained annotators and
huge amounts of effort. Lowering the cost of an-
notation, by making it easier and more accessi-
ble, could greatly facilitate robust NLP in new lan-
guages and genres.
To that end, we design and test new, lightweight
methodologies for syntactic annotation. We pro-
pose a formalism, Fragmentary Unlabeled De-
pendency Grammar (FUDG) for unlabeled de-
pendency syntax that addresses some of the most
glaring deficiencies of basic unlabeled dependen-
cies (?2), with little added burden on annotators.
FUDG requires minimal theoretical commitments,
and can be supplemented with a project-specific
style guide (we provide a brief one for English).
We contribute a simple ASCII markup language?
Graph Fragment Language (GFL; ?3)?that al-
lows annotations to be authored using any text ed-
itor, along with tools for validating, normalizing,
and visualizing GFL annotations.1
An important characteristic of our framework is
annotator flexibility. The formalism supports this
by allowing underspecification of structural por-
tions that are unclear or unnecessary for the pur-
poses of a project. Fully leveraging this power re-
quires new algorithms for evaluation, e.g., of inter-
annotator agreement, where annotations are par-
tial; such algorithms are presented in ?4.2
Finally, small-scale case studies (?5) apply our
framework (formalism, notation, and evaluations)
to syntactically annotate web text in English, news
in Malagasy, and dialogues in Kinyarwanda.
2 A Dependency Grammar for
Annotation
Although dependency-based approaches to syntax
play a major role in computational linguistics, the
nature of dependency representations is far from
uniform. Exemplifying one end of the spectrum
is the Prague Dependency Treebank, which articu-
lates an elaborate dependency-based syntactic the-

ory in a rich, multi-tiered formalism (Hajic?, 1998;
B?hmov? et al, 2003). On the opposite end of
the spectrum are the structures used in dependency
parsing research which organize all the tokens of
a sentence into a tree, sometimes with category la-
bels on the edges (K?bler et al, 2009). Insofar as
they reflect a theory of syntax, these vanilla de-
pendency grammars provide a highly reduction-
ist view of structure?indeed, parses used to train
and evaluate dependency parses are often simpli-
fications of Prague-style parses, or else converted
from constituent treebanks.
In addition to the binary dependency links of
vanilla dependency representations, we offer three
devices to capture certain linguistic phenomena
more straightforwardly:3
1. We make explicit the meaningful lexical units
over which syntactic structure is represented. Our
approach (a) allows punctuation and other extrane-
ous tokens to be excluded so as not to distract from
the essential structure; and (b) permits tokens to be
grouped into shallow multiword lexical units.4
2. Coordination is problematic to represent with
unlabeled dependencies due to its non-binary na-
ture. A coordinating conjunction typically joins
multiple expressions (conjuncts) with equal sta-
tus, and other expressions may relate to the com-
pound structure as a unit. There are several differ-
ent conventions for forcing coordinate structures
into a head-modifier straightjacket (Nivre, 2005;
de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; Marec?ek et al,
2013). Conjuncts, coordinators, and shared de-
pendents can be distinguished with edge labels;
we equivalently use a special notation, permitting
the coordinate structure to be automatically trans-
formed with any of the existing conventions.5
3Some of this is inspired by the conventions of Reed-
Kellogg sentence diagramming, a graphical dependency an-
notation system for English pedagogy (Reed and Kellogg,
1877; Kolln and Funk, 1994; Florey, 2006).
4The Stanford representation supports a limited notion of
multiword expressions (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).
For simplicity, our formalism treats multiwords as unana-
lyzed (syntactically opaque) wholes, though some multiword
expressions may have syntactic descriptions (Baldwin and
Kim, 2010).
5Tesni?re (1959) and Hudson (1984) similarly use
special structures for coordination (Schneider, 1998;
3. Following Tesni?re (1959), our formalism
offers a simple facility to express anaphora-
antecedent relations (a subset of semantic relation-
ships) that are salient in particular syntactic phe-
nomena such as relative clauses, appositives, and
wh-expressions.
Underspecification. Our desire to facilitate
lightweight annotation scenarios requires us to
abandon the expectation that syntactic informants
provide a complete parse for every sentence. On
one hand, an annotator may be uncertain about the
appropriate parse due to lack of expertise, insuf-
ficiently mature annotation conventions, or actual
ambiguity in the sentence. On the other hand, an-
notators may be indifferent to certain phenomena.
This can happen for a variety of reasons:
? Some projects may only need annotations of
specific constructions. For example, building a
semantic resource for events may require anno-
tation of syntactic verb-argument relations, but
not internal noun phrase structure.
? As a project matures, it may be more useful to
annotate only infrequent lexical items.
? Semisupervised learning from partial annota-
tions may be sufficient to learn complete parsers
(Hwa, 1999; Clark and Curran, 2006).
? Beginning annotators may wish to focus on eas-
ily understood syntactic phenomena.
? Different members of a project may wish to spe-
cialize in different syntactic phenomena, reduc-
ing training cost and cognitive load.
Rather than treating annotations as invalid unless
and until they are complete trees, we formally rep-
resent and reason about partial parse structures.
Annotators produce annotations, which encode
constraints on the (inferred) analysis, the parse
structure, of a sentence. We say that a valid anno-
tation supports (is compatible with) one or more
analyses. Both annotations and analyses are rep-
resented as graphs (the graph representation is de-
scribed below in ?3.2). We require that the di-
rected edges in an analysis graph must form a tree
over all the lexical items in the sentence.6 Less
Sangati and Mazza, 2009).
6While some linguistic phenomena (e.g., relative clauses,
control constructions) can be represented using non-tree
52
stringent well-formedness constraints on the an-
notation graph leave room for underspecification.
Briefly, an annotation can be underspecified in
two ways: (a) an expression may not be attached to
any parent, indicating it might depend on any non-
descendant in a full analysis?this is useful for an-
notating sentences piece by piece; and (b) multiple
expressions may be grouped together in a fudge
expression (?3.3), a constraint that the elements
form a connected subgraph in the full analysis
while leaving the precise nature of that subgraph
indeterminate?this is useful for marking relation-
ships between chunks (possibly constituents).
A formalism, not a theory. Our framework for
dependency grammar annotation is a syntactic
formalism, but it is not sufficiently comprehen-
sive to constitute a theory of syntax. Though
it standardizes the basic treatment of a few ba-
sic phenomena, simplicity of the formalism re-
quires us to be conservative about making such
extensions. Therefore, just as with simpler for-
malisms, language- and project-specific conven-
tions will have to be developed for specific linguis-
tic phenomena. By embracing underspecified an-
notation, however, our formalism aims to encour-
age efficient corpus coverage in a nascent anno-
tation project, without forcing annotators to make
premature decisions.
3 Syntactic Formalism and GFL
In our framework, a syntactic annotation of a sen-
tence follows an extended dependency formalism
based on the desiderata enumerated in the previ-
ous section. We call our formalism Fragmentary
Unlabeled Dependency Grammar (FUDG).
To make it simple to create FUDG annotations
with a text editor, we provide a plain-text de-
pendency notation called Graph Fragment Lan-
guage (GFL). Fragments of the FUDG graph?
nodes and dependencies linking them?are en-
coded in this language; taken together, these frag-
ments describe the annotation in its entirety. The
ordering of GFL fragments, and of tokens within
each fragment, is of no formal consequence. Since
the underlying FUDG representation is transpar-
ently related to GFL constructions, GFL notation
will be introduced alongside the discussion of each
kind of FUDG node.7
structures, we find that being able to alert annotators when
they inadvertently violate the tree constraint is more useful
than the expressive flexibility.
7In principle, FUDG annotations could be created with
3.1 Tokens
We expect a tokenized string, such as a sentence
or short message. The provided tokenization is re-
spected in the annotation. For human readability,
GFL fragments refer to tokens as strings (rather
than offsets), so all tokens that participate in an
annotation must be unambiguous in the input.8 A
token may be referenced multiple times in the an-
notation.
3.2 Graph Encoding
Directed arcs. As in other dependency
formalisms, dependency arcs are directed
links indicating the syntactic headedness
relationship between pairs of nodes. In
GFL, directed arcs are indicated with an-
gle brackets pointing from the dependent to
its head, as in black > cat or (equivalently)
cat < black. Multiple arcs can be chained to-
gether: the > cat < black < jet describes three
arcs. Parentheses help group portions of a chain:
(the > cat < black < jet) > likes < fish (the
structure black < jet > likes, in which jet
appears to have two heads, is disallowed). Note
that another encoding for this structure would be
to place the contents of the parentheses and the
chain cat > likes < fish on separate lines. Curly
braces can be used to list multiple dependents of
the same head: {cat fish} > likes.
Anaphoric links. These undirected links join
coreferent anaphora to each other and to their an-
tecedent(s). In English this includes personal pro-
nouns, relative pronouns (who, which, that), and
anaphoric do and so (Leo loves Ulla and so does
Max). This introduces a bit of semantics into our
annotation, though at present we do not attempt to
mark non-anaphoric coreference. It also allows a
more satisfying treatment of appositives and rel-
ative clauses than would be possible from just the
directed tree (the third example in figures 2 and 3).
Lexical nodes. Whereas in vanilla dependency
grammar syntactic links are between pairs of to-
ken nodes, FUDG abstracts away from the indi-
vidual tokens in the input. The lowest level of a
FUDG annotation consists of lexical nodes, i.e.,
an alternative mechanism such as a GUI, as in Hajic? et al
(2001).
8If a word is repeated within the sentence, it must be in-
dexed in the input string in order to be referred to from a
fragment. In our notation, successive instances of the same
word are suffixed with ~1, ~2, ~3, etc. Punctuation and other
tokens omitted from an annotation do not need to be indexed.

lexical item occurrences. Every token node maps
to 0 or 1 lexical nodes (punctuation, for instance,
can be ignored).
A multiword is a lexical node incorporating
more than one input token and is atomic (does
not contain internal structure). A multiword node
may group any subset of input tokens; this allows
for multiword expressions which are not neces-
sarily contiguous in the sentence (e.g., the verb-
particle construction make up in make the story
up). GFL notates multiwords with square brack-
ets, e.g., [break a leg].
Coordination nodes. Coordinate structures re-
quire at least two kinds of dependents: co-
ordinators (i.e., lexical nodes for coordinat-
ing conjunctions?at least one per coordina-
tion node) and conjuncts (heads of the con-
joined subgraphs?at least one per coordination
node). The GFL annotation has three parts:
a variable representing the node, a set of con-
juncts, and a set of coordinator nodes. For in-
stance, $a :: {[peanut butter] honey} :: {and}
(peanut butter and honey) can be embedded
within a phrase via the coordination node
variable $a; a [fresh [[peanut butter] and
honey] sandwich] snack would be formed with
{fresh $a} > sandwich > snack < a. A graphical
example of coordination can be seen in figure 2?
note the bolded conjunct edges and the dotted co-
ordinator edges. If the conjoined phrase as a whole
takes modifiers, these are attached to the coordina-
tion node with regular directed arcs. For example,
in Sam really adores kittens and abhors puppies.,
the shared subject Sam and adverb really attach to
the entire conjoined phrase. In GFL:
$a :: {adores abhors} :: {and}
Sam > $a < really
adores < kittens abhors < puppies
Root node. This is a special top-level node used
to indicate that a graph fragment constitutes a stan-
dalone utterance or a discourse connective. For an
input with multiple utterances, the head of each
should be designated with ** to indicate that it at-
taches to the root.
3.3 Means of Underspecification
As discussed in ?2, our framework distinguishes
annotations from full syntactic analyses. With re-
spect to dependency structure (directed edges), the
former may underspecify the latter, allowing the
annotator to commit only to a partial analysis.
For an annotationA, we define support(A) to be
the set of full analyses compatible with that anno-
tation. A full analysis is required to be a directed
rooted tree over all lexical nodes in the annotation.
An annotation is valid if its support is non-empty.
The 2 mechanisms for dependency underspeci-
fication are unattached nodes and fudge nodes.
Unattached nodes. For any node in an annota-
tion, the annotator is free to simply leave it not
attached to any head. This is interpreted as al-
lowing its head to be any other node (including
the root node), subject to the tree constraint. We
call a node?s possible heads its supported par-
ents. Formally, for an unattached node v in an-
notation A, suppParentsA(v) = nodes(A) \ ({v} ?
descendants(v)).
Fudge nodes. Sometimes, however, it is desir-
able to represent a sort of skeletal structure with-
out filling in all the details. A fudge expres-
sion (FE) asserts that a group of nodes (the ex-
pression?s members) belong together in a con-
nected subgraph, while leaving the internal struc-
ture of that subgraph unspecified.9 The notation
9This underspecification semantics is, to the best of our
knowledge, novel, though it has been proposed that con-
nected dependency subgraphs (known as catenae) are of the-
oretical importance in syntax (Osborne et al, 2012).

for this is a list of two or more nodes within
parentheses: an annotation for Few if any witches
are friends with Maria. might contain the FE
(Few if any) so as to be compatible with the
structures Few < if < any, Few > if > any, etc.?
but not, for instance, Few > witches < any. In
the FUDG graph, this is represented with a fudge
node to which members are attached by special
member arcs. Fudge nodes may be linked to other
nodes: the GFL fragment (Few if any) > witches
is compatible with (Few < if < any) > witches,
(Few < (if > any)) > witches, and so forth.
Properties. Let f be a fudge expression. From
the connected subgraph definition and the tree
constraint on analyses, it follows that:
? Exactly 1 member of f must, in any compatible
analysis, have a parent that is not a member of f.
Call this node the top of the fudge expression,
denoted f ?. f ? dominates all other members of
f; it can be considered f?s ?internal head.?
? f does not necessarily form a full subtree. Any
of its members may have dependents that are
not themselves members of the fudge expres-
sion. (Such dependencies can be specified in
additional GFL fragments.)
Top designation. A single member of a fudge
expression may optionally be designated as its top
(internal head). This is specified with an asterisk:
(Few* if any) > witches indicates that Few must
attach to witches and also dominate both if and
any. In the FUDG graph, this is represented with
a special top arc as depicted in bold in figure 4.
Nesting. One fudge expression may nest
within another, e.g. (Few (if any)) > witches;
the word analyzed as attaching to witches might
be Few or whichever of (if any) heads the other.
A nested fudge expression can be designated as
top: (Vanishingly few (if any)*).
Modifiers. An arc attaching a node to a
fudge expression as a whole asserts that the
external node should modify the top of the fudge
expression (whether or not that top is designated
in the annotation). For instance, two of the
interpretations of British left waffles on Falklands
would be preserved by specifying British > left
and (left waffles) < on < Falklands. Analyses
British > left < waffles < on < Falklands and
(British > left < on < Falklands) > waffles
would be excluded because the preposition does
not attach to the head of (left waffles).10
Multiple membership. A node may be a mem-
ber of multiple fudge expressions, or a member
of an FE while attached to some other node via
an explicit arc. Each connected component of
the FUDG graph is therefore a polytree (not nec-
essarily a tree). The annotation graph minus all
member edges of fudge nodes and all (undirected)
anaphoric links must be a directed tree or forest.
Enumerating supported parents. Fudge ex-
pressions complicate the procedure for listing a
node?s supported parents (see above). Consider an
FE f having some member v. v might be the top
of f (unless some other node is so designated), in
which case anything the fudge node can attach to
is a potential parent of v. If some node other than
v might be the top of f, then v?s head could be any
member of f. Below (?4.1) we develop an algo-
rithm for enumerating supported parents for any
annotation graph node.
4 Annotation Evaluation Measures
For an annotation task which allows for a great
deal of latitude?as in our case, where a syntac-
tic annotation may be full or partial?quantitative
evaluation of data quality becomes a challenge. In
the context of our formalism, we propose mea-
sures that address:
? Annotation efficiency, quantified in terms of
annotator productivity (tokens per hour).
? The amount of information in an underspeci-
fied annotation. Intuitively, an annotation that
flirts with many full analyses conveys less syn-
tactic information than one which supports few
analyses. We define an annotation?s promiscu-
ity to be the number of full analyses it supports,
and develop an algorithm to compute it (?4.1).
10Not all attachment ambiguities can be precisely encoded
in FUDG. For instance, there is no way to forbid an attach-
ment to a word that lies along the path between the pos-
sible heads. The best that can be done given a sentence
like They conspired to defenestrate themselves on Tuesday. is
They > conspired < to < defenestrate < themselves and
(conspired* to defenestrate (on < Tuesday)).
55
? Inter-annotator agreement between two par-
tial annotations. Our measures for dependency
structure agreement (?4.2) incorporate the no-
tion of promiscuity.
We test these evaluations on our pilot annotation
data in the case studies (?5).
4.1 Promiscuity vs. Commitment
Given a FUDG annotation of a sentence, we quan-
tify the extent to which it underspecifies the full
structure by counting the number of analyses that
are compatible with the constraints in the annota-
tion. We call this number the promiscuity of the
annotation. Each analysis tree is rooted with the
root node and must span all lexical nodes.11
A na?ve algorithm for computing promiscuity
would be to enumerate all directed spanning trees
over the lexical nodes, and then check each of
them for compatibility with the annotation. But
this quickly becomes intractable: for n nodes,
one of which is designated as the root, there are
nn?2 spanning trees. However, we can filter out
edges that are known to be incompatible with
the annotation before searching for spanning
trees. Our ?upward-downward? method for
constructing a graph of supported edges first
enumerates a set of candidate top nodes for every
fudge expression, then uses that information
to infer a set of supported parents for every
node.12 The supported edge graph then consists
of vertices lexnodes(A) ? {root} and edges
?
v?lexnodes(A) {(v? v?) ? v? ? suppParentsA(v)}.
From this graph we can count all directed span-
ning trees in cubic time using Kirchhoff?s matrix
tree theorem (Chaiken and Kleitman, 1978; Smith
and Smith, 2007; Margoliash, 2010).13 If some
lexical node has no supported parents, this reflects
conflicting constraints in the annotation, and no
spanning tree will be found.
Promiscuity will tend to be higher for longer
sentences. To control for this, we define a second
quantity, the annotation?s commitment quotient
(commitment being the opposite of promiscuity),
11This measure assumes a fixed lexical analysis (set of lex-
ical nodes) and does not consider anaphoric links. Coordinate
structures are simplified into ordinary dependencies, with co-
ordinate phrases headed by the coordinator?s lexical node. If
a coordination node has multiple coordinators, one is arbi-
trarily chosen as the head and the others as its dependents.
12Python code for these algorithms appears in Schneider
et al (2013) and the accompanying software release.
13Due to a technicality with non-member attachments to
fudge nodes, for some annotations this is only an upper bound
on promiscuity; see Schneider et al (2013).
which normalizes for the number of possible span-
ning trees given the sentence length. The commit-
ment quotient for an annotation of a sentence with
n?1 lexical nodes and one root node is given by:
com(A) = 1 ?
log prom(A)
log nn?2
(the logs are to attenuate the dominance of the ex-
ponential term). This will be 1 if only a single
tree is supported by the annotation, and 0 if the
annotation does not constrain the structure at all.
(If the constraints in the annotation are internally
inconsistent, then promiscuity will be 0 and com-
mitment undefined.) In practice, there is a trade-
off between efficiency and commitment: more de-
tailed annotations require more time. The value of
minimizing promiscuity will therefore depend on
the resources and goals of the annotation project.
4.2 Inter-Annotator Agreement
FUDG can encode flat groupings and coreference
at the lexical level, as well as syntactic structure
over lexical items. Inter-annotator agreement can
be measured separately for each of these facets.
Pilot annotator feedback indicated that our initial
lexical-level guidelines were inadequate, so we fo-
cus here on measuring structural agreement pend-
ing further clarification of the lexical conventions.
Attachment accuracy, a standard measure for
evaluating dependency parsers, cannot be com-
puted between two FUDG annotations if either of
them underspecifies any part of the dependency
structure. One solution is to consider the inter-
section of supported full trees, in the spirit of
our promiscuity measure. For annotations A1 and
A2 of sentence s, one annotation?s supported an-
alyses can be enumerated and then filtered sub-
ject to the constraints of the other annotation.
The tradeoff between inter-annotator compatibil-
ity and commitment can be accounted for by tak-
ing their product, i.e. comPrec(A1 | A2) =
com(A1)
|supp(A1)?supp(A2)|
|supp(A1)|
.
A limitation of this support-intersection ap-
proach is that if the two annotations are not
compatible, the intersection will be empty. A
more fine-grained approach is to decompose
the comparison by lexical node: we general-
ize attachment accuracy with softComPrec(A1 |
A2) = com(A1)
?
`?s
?
i?{1,2} suppParentsAi (`)?
`?s suppParentsA1 (`)
, comput-
ing com(?) and suppParents(?) as in the previous
section. As lexical nodes may differ between the
two annotations, a reconciliation step is required

to compare the structures: multiwords proposed in
only one of the two annotations are converted to
fudge expressions. Tokens annotated by neither
annotator are ignored. Like with the promiscuity
measure, we simplify coordinate structures to or-
dinary dependencies (see footnote 11).
5 Case Studies
5.1 Annotation Time
To estimate annotation efficiency, we performed
a pilot annotation project consisting of annotating
several hundred English tweets, about 1,000 sen-
tences in Malagasy, and a further 1,000 sentences
in Kinyarwanda.14 Table 1 summarizes the num-
ber of tokens annotated and the effort required. For
the two Twitter cases, the same annotator was first
permitted to do partial annotation of 100 tweets,
and then spend the same amount of time doing a
complete annotation of all tokens. Although this is
a very small study, the results clearly suggest she
was able to make much more rapid progress when
partial annotation was an option.15
This pilot study helped us to identify linguistic
phenomena warranting specific conventions: these
include wh-expressions, comparatives, vocatives,
discourse connectives, null copula constructions,
and many others. We documented these cases in a

5.2 Underspecification and Agreement
We annotated 2 small English data samples in
order to study annotators? use of underspecifica-
tion. The first is drawn from Owoputi et al?s 2013
Twitter part-of-speech corpus; the second is from
the Reviews portion of the English Web Treebank
14Malagasy is a VOS Austronesian language spoken by 15
million people, mostly in Madagascar. Kinyarwanda is an
SVO Bantu language spoken by 12 million people mostly in
Rwanda. All annotations were done by native speakers of En-
glish. The Kinyarwanda and Malagasy annotators had basic
proficiency in these languages.
15As a point of comparison, during the Penn Treebank
project, annotators corrected the syntactic bracketings pro-
duced by a high-quality hand-written parser (Fidditch) and
achieved a rate of only 375 tokens/hour using a specialized
GUI interface (Marcus et al, 1993).

Table 2: Measures of our annotation samples. Note that
annotator ?D? specialized in noun phrase?internal structure,
while annotator ?C? specialized in verb phrase/clausal phe-
nomena; C ? D denotes the combination of their annotation
fragments. ?T? denotes our dependency conversion of the
English Web Treebank parses. (The value 1.00 was rounded
up from .9994.)
(EWTB) (Bies et al, 2012). (Our annotators only
saw the tokenized text.) Both datasets are infor-
mal and conversational in nature, and are dom-
inated by short messages/sentences. In spite of
their brevity, many of the items were deemed to
contain multiple ?utterances,? which we define to
include discourse connectives and emoticons (at
best marginal parts of the syntax); utterance heads
are marked with ** in figure 1.
Table 2 indicates the sizes of the two data sam-
ples, and gives statistics over the output of each
annotator: total counts of single-word and mul-
tiword lexical nodes, tokens not represented by
any lexical node, and fudge nodes; as well as
a histogram of promiscuity counts and the aver-
age of commitment quotients (see ?4.1). For in-
stance, the two sets of annotations obtained for the
Tweets sample used underspecification in 17/60
and 23/60 tweets, respectively, though the promis-
cuity rarely exceeded 100 compatible trees per an-
notation. Examples can be seen in figure 1, where
annotator ?A? marked only the noun phrase head
for the scarriest mystery door, opted not to choose
a head within the quantity 1 1/2, and left ambigu-
ous the attachment of the hedge like. The strong
but not utter commitment to the dependency struc-
ture is reflected in the mean commitment quotients
for this dataset, both of which exceed 0.95.
Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is quantified in
table 3. The row marked A ? B, for instance,
considers the agreement between annotator ?A?
and annotator ?B?. Measuring IAA on the depen-
dency structure requires a common set of lexical
nodes, so a lexical reconciliation step ensures that
(a) any token used by either annotation is present
in both, and (b) no multiword node is present
in only one annotation?solved by relaxing in-
compatible multiwords to FEs (which increases
promiscuity). For Tweets, lexical reconciliation
57
thus reduces the commitment averages for each
annotation?to a greater extent for annotator ?A?
(.96 in table 2 vs. .82 in table 3) because ?A?
marked more multiwords. An analysis fully com-
patible with both annotations exists for only 27/60
sentences; the finer-grained softComPrec measure
(?4.2), however, offers insight into the balance be-
tween commitment and agreement.
Qualitatively, we observe three leading causes
of incompatibilities (disagreements): obvious an-
notator mistakes (such as the marked as a head);
inconsistent handling of verbal auxiliaries; and un-
certainty whether to attach expressions to a verb
or the root node, as with here in figure 1.17 An-
notators noticed occasional ambiguous cases and
attempted to encode the ambiguity with fudge ex-
pressions: again in the tweet maybe put it off un-
til you feel like ~ talking again ? is one example.
More often, fudge expressions proved useful for
syntactically difficult constructions, such as those
shown in figure 1 as well as: 2 shy of breaking it,
asked what tribe I was from, a $ 13 / day charge,
you two, and the most awkward thing ever.
5.3 Annotator Specialization
As an experiment in using underspecification for
labor division, two of the annotators of Reviews
data were assigned specific linguistic phenomena
to focus on. Annotator ?D? was tasked with the in-
ternal structure of base noun phrases, including re-
solving the antecedents of personal pronouns. ?C?
was asked to mark the remaining phenomena?
i.e., utterance/clause/verb phrase structure?but to
mark base noun phrases as fudge expressions,
leaving their internal structure unspecified. Both
annotators provided a full lexical analysis. For
comparison, a third individual, ?A,? annotated the
same data in full. The three annotators worked
completely independently.
Of the results in tables 2 and 3, the most notable
difference between full and specialized annotation
is that the combination of independent specialized
annotations (C ? D) produces somewhat higher
promiscuity/lower commitment. This is unsurpris-
ing because annotators sometimes overlook rela-
tionships that fall under their specialty.18 Still, an-
notators reported that specialization made the task
17Another example: Some uses of conjunctions like and
and so can be interpreted as either phrasal coordinators or dis-
course connectives (cf. The PDTB Research Group, 2007).
18A more practical and less error-prone approach might be
for specialists to work sequentially or collaboratively (rather
than independently) on each sentence.

less burdensome, and the specialized annotations
did prove complementary to each other.19
5.4 Treebank Comparison
Though the annotators in our study were native
speakers well acquainted with representations of
English syntax, we sought to quantify their agree-
ment with the expert treebankers who created the
EWTB (the source of the Reviews sentences). We
converted the EWTB?s constituent parses to de-
pendencies via the PennConverter tool (Johansson
and Nugues, 2007),20 then removed punctuation.
Agreement with the converted treebank parses
appears in the bottom two rows of table 3. Be-
cause the EWTB commits to a single analysis,
precision scores are quite lopsided. Most of its
attachments are consistent with our annotations
(softComPrec > 0.9), but these allow many ad-
ditional analyses (hence the scores below 0.5).
6 Conclusion
We have presented a framework for simple depen-
dency annotation that overcomes some of the rep-
resentational limitations of unlabeled dependency
grammar and embraces the practical realities of
resource-building efforts. Pilot studies (in multiple
languages and domains, supported by a human-
readable notation and a suite of open-source tools)
showed this approach lends itself to rapid annota-
tion with minimal training.
The next step will be to develop algorithms ex-
ploiting these representations for learning parsers.
Other future extensions might include additional
expressive mechanisms (e.g., multi-headedness,
labels), crowdsourcing of FUDG annotations
(Snow et al, 2008), or even a semantic counter-
part to the syntactic representation.
19In fact, for only 2 sentences did ?C? and ?D? have in-
compatible annotations, and both were due to simple mis-
takes that were then fixed in the combination.
20We ran PennConverter with options chosen to emulate
our annotation conventions; see Schneider et al (2013).
