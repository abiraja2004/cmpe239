Abstract
Pitch accent placement is a major
topic in intonational phonology re-
search and its application to speech
synthesis. What factors inuence
whether or not a word is made
intonationally prominent or not is
an open question. In this paper,
we investigate how one aspect of a
word's local context | its colloca-
tion with neighboring words | inu-
ences whether it is accented or not.
Results of experiments on two tran-
scribed speech corpora in a medical
domain show that such collocation
information is a useful predictor of
pitch accent placement.
1 Introduction
In English, speakers make some words more
intonationally prominent than others. These
words are said to be accented or to bear
pitch accents. Accented words are typically
louder and longer than their unaccented coun-
terparts, and their stressable syllable is usu-
ally aligned with an excursion in the funda-
mental frequency. This excursion will dier
in shape according to the type of pitch ac-
cent. Pitch accent type, in turn, inuences
listeners' interpretation of the accented word
or its larger syntactic constituent. Previous
research has associated pitch accent with vari-
ation in various types of information status,
including the given/new distinction, focus, and
contrastiveness, inter alia. Assigning pitch ac-
cent in speech generation systems which em-
ploy speech synthesizers for output is thus crit-
ical to system performance: not only must one
convey meaning naturally, as humans would,
but one must avoid conveying mis-information
which reliance on the synthesizers' defaults
may result in.
The speech generation work discussed here
is part of a larger eort in developing an intel-
ligent multimedia presentation generation sys-
tem called MAGIC (Medical Abstract Gen-
eration for Intensive Care) (Dalal et al,
1996). In MAGIC, given a patient's medical
record stored at Columbia Presbyterian Medi-
cal Center (CPMC)'s on-line database system,
the system automatically generates a post-
operative status report for a patient who has
just undergone bypass surgery. There are two
media-specic generators in MAGIC: a graph-
ics generator which automatically produces
graphical presentations from database entities,
and a spoken language generator which auto-
matically produces coherent spoken language
presentations from these entities. The graph-
ical and the speech generators communicate
with each other on the y to ensure that the
nal multimedia output is synchronized.
In order to produce natural and coherent
speech output, MAGIC's spoken language gen-
erator models a collection of speech features,
such as accenting and intonational phrasing,
which are critical to the naturalness and intel-
ligibility of output speech. In order to assign
these features accurately, the system needs to
identify useful correlates of accent and phrase
boundary location to use as predictors. This
work represents part of our eorts in identi-
fying useful predictors for pitch accent place-
ment.
Pitch accent placement has long been a re-
search focus for scientists working on phonol-
ogy, speech analysis and synthesis (Bolinger,
1989; Ladd, 1996). In general, syntactic fea-
tures are the most widely used features in
pitch accent predication. For example, part-
of-speech is traditionally the most useful sin-
gle pitch accent predictor (Hirschberg, 1993).
Function words, such as prepositions and ar-
ticles, are less likely to be accented, while
content words, such as nouns and adjectives,
are more likely to be accented. Other lin-
guistic features, such as inferred given/new
status (Hirschberg, 1993; Brown, 1983), con-
trastiveness (Bolinger, 1961), and discourse
structure (Nakatani, 1998), have also been ex-
amined to explain accent assignment in large
speech corpora. In a previous study (Pan and
McKeown, 1998; Pan andMcKeown, 1999), we
investigated how features such as deep syntac-
tic/semantic structure and word informative-
ness correlate with accent placement. In this
paper, we focus on how local context inuences
accent patterns. More specically, we investi-
gate how word collocation inuences whether
nouns are accented or not.
Determining which nouns are accented and
which are not is challenging, since part-of-
speech information cannot help here. So, other
accent predictors must be found. There are
some advantages in looking only at one word
class. We eliminate the interaction between
part-of-speech and collocation, so that the in-
uence of collocation is easier to identify. It
also seems likely that collocation may have a
greater impact on content words, like nouns,
than on function words, like prepositions.
Previous researchers have speculated that
word collocation aects stress assignment of
noun phrases in English. For example, James
Marchand (1993) notes how familiar colloca-
tions change their stress, witness the American
pronunciation of `Little House' [in the televi-
sion series Little House on the Prairie], where
stress used to be on HOUSE, but now, since the
series is so familiar, is placed on the LITTLE.
That is, for collocated words, stress shifts to
the left element of the compound. However,
there are numerous counter-examples: con-
sider apple PIE, which retains a right stress
pattern, despite the collocation. So, the ex-
tent to which collocational status aects ac-
cent patterns is still unclear.
Despite some preliminary investigation
(Liberman and Sproat, 1992), word colloca-
tion information has not, to our knowledge,
been successfully used to model pitch accent
assignment; nor has it been incorporated into
any existing speech synthesis systems. In this
paper, we empirically verify the usefulness of
word collocation for accent prediction. In Sec-
tion 2, we describe our annotated speech cor-
pora. In Section 3, we present a description of
the collocation measures we investigated. Sec-
tion 4 to 7 describe our analyses and machine
learning experiments in which we attempt to
predict accent location. In Section 8 we sum
up our results and discuss plans for further re-
search.
2 Speech Corpora
From the medical domain described in Section
1, we collected two speech corpora and one text
corpus for pitch accent modeling. The speech
corpora consist of one multi-speaker sponta-
neous corpus, containing twenty segments and
totaling fty minutes, and one read corpus of
ve segments, read by a single speaker and to-
taling eleven minutes of speech. The text cor-
pus consists of 3.5 million words from 7375 dis-
charge summaries of patients who had under-
gone surgery. The speech corpora only cover
cardiac patients, while the text corpus covers
a larger group of patients and the majority of
them have also undergone cardiac surgery.
The speech corpora were rst transcribed or-
thographically and then intonationally, using
the ToBI convention for prosodic labeling of
standard American English (Silverman et al,
1992). For this study, we used only binary ac-
cented/deaccented decisions derived from the
ToBI tonal tier, in which location and type
of pitch accent is marked. After ToBI label-
ing, each word in the corpora was tagged with
part-of-speech, from a nine-element set: noun,
verb, adjective, adverb, article, conjunction,
pronoun, cardinal, and preposition. The spon-
taneous corpus was tagged by hand and the
read tagged automatically. As noted above,
we focus here on predicting whether nouns are
accented or not.
3 Collocation Measures
We used three measures of word collocation to
examine the relationship between collocation
and accent placement: word bigram pre-
dictability, mutual information, and the
Dice coefficient. While word predictabil-
ity is not typically used to measure collocation,
there is some correlation between word collo-
cation and predictability. For example, if two
words are collocated, then it will be easy to
predict the second word from the rst. Sim-
ilarly, if one word is highly predictable given
another word, then there is a higher possibility
that these two words are collocated. Mutual
information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice coe?-
cient (Dice, 1945) are two standard measures
of collocation. In general, mutual information
measures uncertainty reduction or departure
from independence. The Dice coe?cient is a
collocation measure widely used in information
retrieval. In the following, we will give a more
detailed denitions of each.
Statistically, bigram word predictability is
dened as the log conditional probability of
word w
i
, given the previous word w
i 1
:
Pred(w
i
) = log(Prob(w
i
jw
i 1
))
Bigram predictability directly measures the
likelihood of seeing one word, given the
occurrence of the previous word. Bi-
gram predictability has two forms: abso-
lute and relative. Absolute predictability is
the value directly computed from the for-
mula. For example, given four adjacent
words w
i 1
; w
i
; w
i+1
and w
i+2
, if we assume
Prob(w
i
jw
i 1
) = 0:0001, Prob(w
i+1
jw
i
) =
0:001, and Prob(w
i+2
jw
i+1
) = 0:01, the abso-
lute bigram predictability will be -4, -3 and
-2 for w
i
; w
i+1
and w
i+2
. The relative pre-
dictability is dened as the rank of absolute
predictability among words in a constituent.
In the same example, the relative predictabil-
ity will be 1, 2 and 3 for w
i
; w
i+1
and w
i+2
,
where 1 is associated with the word with the
lowest absolute predictability. In general, the
higher the rank, the higher the absolute pre-
dictability. Except in Section 7, all the pre-
dictability measures mentioned in this paper
use the absolute form.
We used our text corpus to compute bigram
word predictability for our domain. When cal-
culating the word bigram predictability, we
rst ltered uncommon words (words occur-
ring 5 times or fewer in the corpus) then used
the Good-Turing discount strategy to smooth
the bigram. Finally we calculated the log con-
ditional probability of each word as the mea-
sure of its bigram predictability.
Two measures of mutual information were
used for word collocation: pointwise mu-
tual information, which is dened as :
I
1
(w
i 1
;w
i
) = log
P
r
(w
i 1
; w

)
P

and average mutual information, which
is dened as:

) =
P

The same text corpus was used to compute
both mutual information measures. Only word
pairs with bigram frequency greater than ve
were retained.
The Dice coe?cient is dened as:
Dice(w
i 1
; w
i
) =
2 P
r
(w
i 1
; w
i
)
P
r
(w
i 1
) + P

(w

)
Here, we also use a cut o threshold of ve to
lter uncommon bigrams.
Although all these measures are correlated,
one measure can score word pairs quite dier-
ently from another. Table 1 shows the top ten
collocations for each metric.
In the predictability top ten list, we have
pairs like scarlet fever where fever is very pre-
dictable from scarlet (in our corpus, scarlet is
always followed by fever), thus, it ranks high-
est in the predictability list. Since scarlet can
be di?cult to predict from fever, these types
of pairs will not receive a very high score us-
ing mutual information (in the top 5% in I
1
sorted list and in the top 20% in I
2
list) and
Dice coe?cient (top 22%). From this table, it
is also quite clear that I
1
tends to rank un-
common words high. All the words in the top
ten I
1
list have a frequency less than or equal

than six times).
Of the dierent metrics, only bigram pre-
dictability is a unidirectional measure. It cap-
tures how the appearance of one word aects
the appearance of the following word. In con-
trast, the other measures are all bidirectional
measures, making no distinction between the
relative position of elements of a pair of col-
located items. Among the bidirectional mea-
sures, point-wise mutual information is sensi-
tive to marginal probabilities P
r
(word
i 1
) and
P
r
(word
i
). It tends to give higher values as
these probabilities decrease, independently of
the distribution of their co-occurrence. The
Dice coe?cient, however, is not sensitive to
marginal probability. It computes conditional
probabilities which are equally weighted in
both directions.
Average mutual information measures the
reduction in the uncertainty, of one word,
given another, and is totally symmetric. Since
I
2
(word
i 1
; word
i
)=I
2
(word
i
;word
i 1
), the
uncertainty reduction of the rst word, given
the second word, is equal to the uncer-
tainty reduction of the second word, given the
rst word. Further more, because I
2
(word
i
;
word
i 1
) = I
2
(word
i
;word
i 1
), the uncer-
tainty reduction of one word, given another,
is also equal to the uncertainty reduction of
failing to see one word, having failed to see
the other.
Since there is considerable evidence that
prior discourse context, such as previous men-
tion of a word, aects pitch accent decisions,
it is possible that symmetric measures, such
as mutual information and the Dice coe?-
cient, may not model accent placement as
well as asymmetric measures, such as bigram
predictability. Also, the bias of point-wise
mutual information toward uncommon words
can aect its ability to model accent assign-
ment, since, in general, uncommon words are
more likely to be accented (Pan and McKe-
own, 1999). Since this metric disproportion-
ately raises the mutual information for un-
common words, making them more predictable
than their appearance in the corpus warrants,
it may predict that uncommon words are more
likely to be deaccented than they really are.
4 Statistical Analyses
In order to determine whether word collo-
cation is useful for pitch accent prediction,
we rst employed Spearman's rank correlation
test (Conover, 1980).
In this experiment, we employed a unigram
predictability-based baseline model. The un-
igram predictability of a word is dened as
the log probability of a word in the text cor-
pus. The maximum likelihood estimation of
this measure is:
log
Freq(w
i
)
P
i
Freq(w
i
)
The reason for choosing this as the baseline
model is not only because it is context inde-
pendent, but also because it is eective. In
a previous study (Pan and McKeown, 1999),
we showed that when this feature is used, it
is as powerful a predictor as part-of-speech.
When jointly used with part-of-speech infor-
mation, the combined model can perform sig-
nicantly better than each individual model.
When tested on a similar medical corpus, this
combined model also outperforms a compre-
hensive pitch accent model employed by the
Bell Labs' TTS system (Sproat et al, 1992;
Hirschberg, 1993; Sproat, 1998), where dis-
course information, such as given/new, syntac-
tic information, such as POS, and surface in-
formation, such as word distance, are incorpo-
rated. Since unigram predictability is context
independent. By comparing other predictors
to this baseline model, we can demonstrate the
impact of context, measured by word colloca-
tion, on pitch accent assignment.
Table 2 shows that for our read speech
corpus, unigram predictability, bigram pre-
dictability and mutual information are all sig-
nicantly correlated (p < 0:001) with pitch ac-
cent decision.
1
However, the Dice coe?cient
shows only a trend toward correlation (p <
0:07). In addition, both bigram predictabil-
ity and (pointwise) mutual information show a
slightly stronger correlation with pitch accent
than the baseline. When we conducted a sim-
ilar test on the spontaneous corpus, we found
that all but the baseline model are signicantly
correlated with pitch accent placement. Since
all three models incorporate a context word
while the baseline model does not, these re-
sults suggest the usefulness of context in ac-
cent prediction. Overall, for all the dierent
measures of collocation, bigram predictability
explains the largest amount of variation in ac-
cent status for both corpora. We conducted a
similar test using trigram predictability, where
two context words, instead of one, were used
to predict the current word. The results are
slightly worse than bigram predictability (for
the read corpus r =  0:167, p < 0:0001; for
the spontaneous r =  0:355, p < 0:0001).
The failure of the trigram model to improve
over the bigram model may be due to sparse
data. Thus, in the following analysis, we focus
on bigram predictability. In order to further
verify the eectiveness of word predictability
in accent prediction, we will show some exam-
ples in our speech corpora rst. Then we will
describe how machine learning helps to derive
pitch accent prediction models using this fea-
ture. Finally, we show that both absolute pre-
dictability and relative predictability are use-
ful for pitch accent prediction.

Since pointwise mutual information performed con-
sistently better than average mutual information in our
experiment, we present results only for the former.
5 Word Predictability and Accent
In general, nouns, especially head nouns, are
very likely to be accented. However, cer-
tain nouns consistently do not get accented.
For example, Table 3 shows some collocations
containing the word cell in our speech cor-
pus. For each context, we list the collocated
pair, its most frequent accent pattern in our
corpus (upper case indicates that the word
was accented and lower case indicates that
it was deaccented), its bigram predictability
(the larger the number is, the more predictable
the word is), and the frequency of this ac-
cent pattern, as well as the total occurrence
of the bigram in the corpus. In the rst ex-
Word Pair Pred(cell) Freq
[of] CELL -3.11 7/7
[RED] CELL -1.119 2/2
[PACKED] cell -0.5759 4/6
[BLOOD] cell -0.067 2/2
Table 3: cell Collocations
ample, cell in [of ] CELL is very unpredictable
from the occurrence of of and always receives a
pitch accent. In [RED] CELL, [PACKED] cell,
and [BLOOD] cell, cell has the same semantic
meaning, but dierent accent patterns: cell in
[PACKED] cell and [BLOOD] cell is more pre-
dictable and deaccented, while in [RED] CELL
it is less predictable and is accented. These
examples show the inuence of context and
its usefulness for bigram predictability. Other
predictable nouns, such as saver in CELL
saver usually are not accented even when they
function as head nouns. Saver is deaccented in
ten of the eleven instances in our speech cor-
pus. Its bigram score is -1.5517, which is much
higher than that of CELL (-4.6394{3.1083 de-
pending upon context). Without collocation
information, a typical accent prediction sys-
tem is likely to accent saver, which would be
inappropriate in this domain.
6 Accent Prediction Models
Both the correlation test results and direct ob-
servations provide some evidence on the useful-
ness of word predictability. But we still need to
demonstrate that we can successfully use this
feature in automatic accent prediction. In or-
der to achieve this, we used machine learning

techniques to automatically build accent pre-
diction models using bigram word predictabil-
ity scores.
We used RIPPER (Cohen, 1995b) to ex-
plore the relations between predictability and
accent placement. RIPPER is a classication-
based rule induction system. From annotated
examples, it derives a set of ordered if-then
rules, describing how input features can be
used to predict an output feature. In order
to avoid overtting, we use 5-fold cross valida-
tion. The training data include all the nouns in
the speech corpora. The independent variables
used to predict accent status are the unigram
and bigram predictability measures, and the
dependent variable is pitch accent status. We
used a majority-based predictability model as
our baseline (i.e. predict accented).
In the combined model, both unigram and
bigram predictability are used together for ac-
cent prediction. From the results in Table 4,
we see that the bigram model consistently out-
performs the unigram model, and the com-
bined model achieves the best performance.
To evaluate the signicance of the improve-
ments achieved by incorporating a context
word, we use the standard error produced by
RIPPER. Two results are statistically signif-
icant when the results plus or minus twice
the standard error do not overlap (Cohen,
1995a). As shown in Table 4, for the read
corpus, except for the unigram model, all the
models with bigram predictability performed
signicantly better than the baseline model.
However, the bigram model and the combined
model failed to improve signicantly over the
unigram model. This may result from too
small a corpus. For the spontaneous corpus,
the unigram, bigram and the combined model
all achieved signicant improvement over the
baseline. The bigram also performed signi-
cantly better than the unigram model. The
combined model had the best performance. It
also achieved signicant improvement over the
unigram model.
The improvement of the combined model
over both unigram and bigram models may
be due to the fact that some accent patterns
that are not captured by one are indeed cap-
tured by the other. For example, accent pat-
terns for street names have been extensively
discussed in the literature (Ladd, 1996). For
example, street in phrases like (e.g. FIFTH
street) is typically deaccented while avenue
(e.g. Fifth AVENUE) is accented. While it
seems likely that the conditional probability
of P
r
(StreetjFifth) is no higher than that of
P
r
(AvenuejFifth), the unigram probability of
P
r
(street) is probably higher than that of av-
enue P
r
(avenue).

. So, incorporating both
predictability measures may tease apart these
and similar cases.
7 Relative Predictability
In the our previous analysis, we showed the ef-
fectiveness of absolute word predictability. We
now consider whether relative predictability is
correlated with a larger constituent's accent
pattern. The following analysis focuses on ac-
cent patterns of non-trivial base NPs.
3
For
this study we labeled base NPs by hand for
the corpora described in Section 2. For each
base NP, we calculate which word is the most
predictable and which is the least. We want
to see, when comparing with its neighboring
2
For example, in a 7.5M word general news corpus
(from CNN and Reuters), street occurs 2115 times and
avenue just 194. Therefore, the unigram predictabil-
ity of street is higher than that of avenue. The most
common bigram with street is Wall Street which occurs
116 times and the most common bigram with avenue is
Pennsylvania Avenue which occurs 97. In this domain,
the bigram predictability for street in Fifth Street is ex-
tremely low because this combination never occurred,
while that for avenue in Fifth Avenue is -3.0995 which
is the third most predictable bigrams with avenue as
the second word.

more likely to be deaccented. As shown in Ta-
ble 5, the \total" column represents the total
number of most (or least) predictable words
in all baseNPs
4
. The next two columns indi-
cate how many of them are accented and deac-
cented. The last column is the percentage of
words that are accented. Table 5 shows that
the probability of accenting a most predictable
word is between 40:48% and 45:96% and that
of a least predictable word is between 72:72%
and 80:08%. This result indicates that rela-
tive predictability is also a useful predictor for
a word's accentability.
8 Discussion
It is di?cult to directly compare our results
with previous accent prediction studies, to
determine the general utility of bigram pre-
dictability in accent assignment, due to dif-
ferences in domain and the scope of our task.
For example, Hirschberg (1993) built a com-
prehensive accent prediction model using ma-
chine learning techniques for predicting ac-
cent status for all word classes for a text-to-
speech system, employing part-of-speech, var-
ious types of information status inferred from
the text, and a number of distance metrics,
as well as a complex nominal predictor devel-
oped by Sproat (1992). An algorithm making
use of these features achieved 76.5%-80% ac-
cent prediction accuracy for a broadcast news

pus of spontaneous elicited speech, and 98.3%
success on a corpus of laboratory read sen-
tences. Liberman and Sproat's (1992) success
in predicting accent patterns for complex nom-
inals alone, using rules combining a number
of features, achieved considerably higher suc-
cess rates (91% correct, 5.4% acceptable, 3.6%
unacceptable when rated by human subjects)
for 500 complex nominals of 2 or more ele-
ments chosen from the AP Newswire. Our re-
sults, using bigram predictability alone, 77%
for the spontaneous corpus and 85% for the
read corpus, and using a dierent success es-
timate, while not as impressive as (Liberman
and Sproat, 1992)'s, nonetheless demonstrate
the utility of a relatively untested feature for
this task.
In this paper, we have investigated several
collocation-based measures for pitch accent
prediction. Our initial hypothesis was that
word collocation aects pitch accent place-
ment, and that the more predictable a word
is in terms of its local lexical context, the
more likely it is to be deaccented. In order
to verify this claim, we estimated three col-
location measures: word predictability, mu-
tual information and the Dice coe?cient. We
then used statistical techniques to analyze the
correlation between our dierent word collo-
cation metrics and pitch accent assignment
for nouns. Our results show that, of all the
collocation measures we investigated, bigram
word predictability has the strongest correla-
tion with pitch accent assignment. Based on
this nding, we built several pitch accent mod-
els, assessing the usefulness of unigram and
bigram word predictability {as well as a com-
bined model{ in accent predication. Our re-
sults show that the bigram model performs
consistently better than the unigram model,
which does not incorporate local context in-
formation. However, our combined model per-
forms best of all, suggesting that both con-
textual and non-contextual features of a word
are important in determining whether or not
it should be accented.
These results are particularly important for
the development of future accent assignment
algorithms for text-to-speech. For our contin-
uing research, we will focus on two directions.
The rst is to combine our word predictability
feature with other pitch accent predictors that
have been previously used for automatic accent
prediction. Features such as information sta-
tus, grammatical function, and part-of-speech,
have also been shown to be important deter-
minants of accent assignment. So, our nal
pitch accent model should include many other
features. Second, we hope to test whether the
utility of bigram predictability can be gener-
alized across dierent domains. For this pur-
pose, we have collected an annotated AP news
speech corpus and an AP news text corpus,
and we will carry out a similar experiment in
this domain.
