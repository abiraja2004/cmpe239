Abstract: 
This paper descr ibes  a possi -  
b i l i ty  of express ing order ing  con- 
s t ra ints  among non-s is ter  const i tuents  
in b inary  branch ing syntact ic  
s t ructures  on a local basis, suppor ted  
by v iewing  the b inary  branch ing  
s t ructure  as a list (rather than a 
tree) of const i tuents  w i th in  HPSG- 
style grammars.  The core idea of such 
a descr ip t ion  of order ing is const i -  
tuted by creat ing a type lat t ice for 
l ists. The poss ib i l i t ies  of express ing  
d i f ferent  approaches to word order in 
the f ramework are br ie f ly  discussed, 
exempl i f ied  and compared to other 
methods.  
In the standard immediate-con-  
s t i tuent  based approaches,  the "free" 
word order  I is descr ibed e i ther  di- 
rect ly  in the phrase-s t ructure  (PS) 
rules, wh ich  thus express s imul tane-  
ous ly  both dominance (mother/daughter)  
re la t ions  and precedence (ordering) 
re lat ions  between syntact ic  cate- 
gories, or, in more recent formal isms 
such as GPSG or HPSG, by the l inear 
precedence  (LP) rules c reat ing  a sepa- 
rate component  of the grammar,  whose 
other  component  is the set of immedi-  
a te -dominance  (ID) rules. In both the- 
se cases, the order ing const ra in ts  are 
l im i ted  to sister const i tuents,  i.e. 
they are str ict ly  local. 
One of the prob lems of both 
these var iat ions  of the s tandard  PS- 
approach is the descr ip t ion  of ad- 
juncts (free modif iers) .  On the usual 
assumpt ion  that their number per clau- 
se is in pr inc ip le  not l imi ted  (though 
f in i te for a part icu lar  clause), an 
approach to their order ing presuppos-  
ing them to be all s ister const i tuents  
laust necessar i l y  p resuppose  also an 
(at least potent ia l ly)  in f in i te  set of 
generat ive  rules (e.g., a set induced 
by a K leene star used in a "basic" 
var iant  of one of the rules).  
In languages whose grammar  al- 
lows for more word order  f reedom than 
Eng l i sh  2, it is often the case that 
ad juncts  and complements  of a head 
(typically, but not solely, of a fi- 
n i te  verb) can be f ree ly  intermixed, 
which makes the approach where the lo- 
ca l i ty  of LP const ra ints  forces the 
head as well  as its mod i f ie rs  (both 
complements  and adjuncts) be expanded 
as s isters sti l l  less at t ract ive.  
Another  poss ib i l i ty  of de- 
scr ip t ion  of word order is the "topo- 
log ica l"  approach used predominant ly  
in more t rad i t iona l ly  o r iented  German 
l inguist ics .  App l ied  to German, this 
approach div ides a c lause into several  
word order "f ie lds" ("Vorfeld", 
"Mitte l fe ld",  "Nachfeld",  " l inke/ rech-  
te Satzklammer") whose mutua l  pos i t ion 
is fixed, and studies main ly  the word 
order  regular i t ies  wi th in  these 
"f ie lds".  Though a lot of work has 
been done and many va luab le  insights 
presented  with in  this paradigm, seen 
f rom the v iewpoint  of computat iona l  
l ingu is t i cs  this approach  has the 
fata l  d i sadvantage  that it is ex- 
t remely  d i f f icu l t  to formal ize  within 
the s tandard  f rameworks  (e.g., none of 
the "f ie lds" with the poss ib le  ex- 
cept ion of "Vorfeld" creates  a con- 
s t i tuent  in any usual  sense etc.).  
AS an a l ternat ive  to the two ba- 
sic approaches ment ioned above (as a 
mod i f i ca t ion  of the f irst one, in 
fact), the descr ipt ion  based  on binary 
r ight -branch ing  s t ructures  has been 
proposed  independent ly  in several  
works concerned with languages ex-

hibiting a considerable share of free 
word order: in (Uszkoreit,1986) for 
the description of verb-final clauses 
Jn German, in (Gunji, 1987) for 
Japanese and in (Avgustinova and Ol/- 
va,1990) for (mainly) Slavic lan- 
guages. However, the price paid for 
the removal of some problems, mainly, 
the free intermixing of heads, comple- 
ments and adjuncts, of the above- 
mentioned more standard descriptions 
is rather high - at least two problem- 
atic points arise due to the strict 
binarity of the structure. The first 
of them is the fact that in binary 
structures no LP-rules relying on the 
relation "being sister constituent" 
can be used for ordering heads, com- 
plements and adjuncts in cases this is 
required, since these are not sisters 
any more. The second problematic point 
can be seen at best at the variant of 
the formalism given in (Avgustinova 
and Oliva, 1990) the occurrence of 
the phonological ly empty rightmost 
element of the branching 3 (c f .  the 
structure (1) for the string "John 
kissed Mary yesterday"). 
6 
The former problem concerning word or- 
der is in the majority of the binary- 
branching approaches (as far as they 
are at all concerned with it) solved 
by introducing word order mechanisms 
which are either of non-local nature 
or which burden the syntactic cate- 
gories (understood as feature bundles) 
with otherwise unmotivated features 
used solely for the purpose of im- 
posing ordering constraints (and most 
often, with a combination of the two). 
Neither approach is more fortunate 
than the other - nonulocality is su- 
rely an unwished phenomenon in the de- 
scription, and the presence of special 
ordering features in the categories is 
hardly better, i.a. also because order 
is a property of the syntactic struc- 
ture (made of categories) rather than 
of the categories themselves 4 . 
This paper will try to show that 
in spite of the abovementioned reser- 
vations the "binary branching" can be 
a correct and fruitful approach to 
syntactic description if seen from a 
slightly different viewpoint. In order 
to get the proper perspective, let us 
observe the "binary branching" 
structure for the example sentence 
"The small boy ate an apple" shown in 
(2) . 
There are several things to be 
taken into consideration here. 
The most obvious among them is 
the division of the structure into 
"levels" - contiguous sequences.of no- 
des with identical marking. Thus one 
,,dj( .... 1 ,1/  \

"VP-level" and two "NP-levels" are to 
be c lear ly  seen, each having a dist in-  
gu ished element at its end (the phono-  
log ica l ly  empty element). 
Further, it can be observed that 
each of the "levels" has one (and only 
one) other  d is t ingu ished element some- 
where in a non-f inal  pos i t ion - it is 
the V e lement for the "VP- level"  and 
the N e lements  for the "NP-levels",  in 
other  words each level has a head, 
It is also worth remark ing that 
the levels  of the b inary branch ing  
have a d i rect  relat ion to more usual 
approaches.  Thus, the standard i~ed i -  
a te -const i tuent  tree (3) for the sen- 
tence f rom (2) can be obta ined by fac- 
to r i z ing  (collapsing) the NP nodes 
from the respect ive NP- leve ls  into a 
s ingle one, and by factor iz ing all  the 
VP-nodes except for the uppermost  
"sentent ia l "  one.

The dependency  tree (4) of the same 
sentence can be then obta ined by col- 
laps ing all  nodes of a level p lus its 
head into a s ingle node.

the  smal l  
The most str ik ing observat ion  
concern ing  the syntact ic  s t ructures  of 
the k ind exempl i f ied  in (2), however, 
is the nature of their  data type: 
showing a str ict  b inary r ight -d i rected 
branch ing  and having a d is t ingu ished 
(by its phono log ica l  emptiness) node 
as their  f inal element, they are in 
fact noth ing  but l i s t s  5 . 
Adopt ing  this view br ings along 
several  advantages:  
- first, the syntactic structure 
is s t r i c t ly  un i form - and also s impler  
than the genera l  tree structure, with 
all (mainly practical)  consequences 
fo l lowing from this 
second, the overa l l  usage of 
l ists (whose members may be l ists 
again) br ings back the not ion  of lo- 
cal i ty  of syntact ic  descr ip t ion  - each 
list used in the st ructure (i.e., each 
" level" of the st ructure as d iscussed 
above) const i tutes a local  domain, 
creat ing thus also a natura l  area of 
app l icat ion  of local  constra ints  (such 
as subcategor izat ion,  l inear prece-  
dence etc.) 
- third, such an approach al lows 
for merg ing  both the syntact ic  and the 
topo log ica l  approaches in a single 
formal descr ipt ion,  keeping,  however, 
the two components c lear ly  separated - 
the categor ia l  in format ion  being ex- 
p ressed  by means of (syntactic and 
other) features and their  bundles 
(attr ibute-value matr ices) ,  the topo- 
log ica l  in format ion be ing expressed by 
means of ref inement of k inds of l ists 
and their  e lements and subl ists.  
Thus, given fa i r ly  usual as- 
sumpt ions about the nature and func- 
t ion of const i tuents  in a phrase, the 
general  type 6 for nonempty  l ists f rom 
(5) is to be split into subtypes shown 
in (6) (where minor  covers const i -  
tuents made of cemplement izers ,  
part ic les  etc.).

In pract ice,  even more del icate divi -  
sion is needed according to kinds of 
phrases used and according to the na- 
ture of modi f ie rs  these phrases allow. 
In t roduct ion of more f ine-gra ined sub- 
types may be needed also for the f inal 
e lement of a list (usually n?1); the 
respect ive  subtypes should mi r ror  the 
kinds of phrases used as funct ions of 
the " levels"  of the syntact ic  struc- 
ture, g iv ing thus rise, e.g., to types 
end o fnp ,  end o fvp  etc. 
\[\]sing a d i f ferent  form of struc- 
tural  representat ion  enforces also us- 
ing d i f ferent  form (but not d i f ferent  
background intuit ions) of rules and 
pr inc ip les  of the grammar, all  of them 
cor respond ing  to the  types of l ists as 
in t roduced in the immediate ly  preced-  
ing text. 
Thus, the Head Feature Pr inc ip le  
(HFP) is to be expressed as a conjunc-  
t ion of two impl icat ions 7 (rather than 
a s ingle implication, combin ing con- 
junct ive ly  with other pr inc ip les  of 
the grammar),  one descr ib ing the case 
where the first element of the respec- 
tive nonempty  8 list is the head of the 
respect ive  phrase ("level"), the other 
one descr ib ing  the rest of the cases.

Assuming the vers ion of HPSG using 
sets (rather than lists) as values of 
the feature subcat, the Subcategor i -  
zat ion Pr inc ip le  has to consist  of 
four impl icat ions,  each for a part i -  
cular conf igurat ion  in the syntact ic  
l ist 9 . The first part descr ibes the 
impact of an expansion of a comple- 
ment, the second the impact of an ex- 
pans ion of a head (consist ing just in 
copying the subcategor izat ion of the 
head into a special head feature 
head subcat, with the aim of inherit -  
ing the information about the 
subcategor izat ion  of the head const i -  
tuent into the final element of the 
respect ive list via the HFP), the 
third the impact of an expansion of an 
adjunct or of a minor  category, and 
the last one expresses the requirement 
that the subcahegor izat ion  of the fi- 
nal e lement of the phrase, cover ing  no 
syntact ic  material ,  be equal  to the 
subcategor izat ion  of the head of the 
phrase. (The effect of the second and 
the fourth impl icat ion taken together  
is worth compar ing with the above- 
ment ioned  condit ion f rom works by 
Uszkore i t  and Gunji, namely  that the 
verb - the source of the subcatego-  
r izat ion stand at the end of the 
clause.)

Assuming further a phono log ica l  pr in-

the combinat ion I? of phono log ies  of 
their  first and rest subconst i tuents,  
this approach al lows for reduct ion of 
the number of grammar schemata

The word order constraints,  on the 
other hand, can be expressed  within 
the h ierarchy of sorts of l ists used 
in the system, by means of which the 
order ing informat ion is not only kept 
separated from the categor Ja l  one, but 
is also formulated in local domains 
(each const i tuted by a llst) only.

The pract ical  usage of the idea 
of using the sort h ierarchy of l ists 
for the purpose of express ing word 
order constra ints  will  be now il lu- 
strated on an example. In this exam- 
ple, the symbol "==" will be used  for 
def in ing the type hierarchy. The type

standing on its r ight-hand side. As 
(i0) \[clause \] == \[verb first_clause \] 
v \[verb second clause \] 
v \[verblast c lause  \] 
the example proper, let us take a 
s l ight ly  s impl i f ied  system of German 
word order as used in the "f ie ld"-  
based approach, and let us assume for 
the moment that the sorts f in i te verb, 
nonf in i teverb ,  complement and adjunct 
are pr imi t ives  (though, obviously,  in 
real i ty  they are net). The descr ipt ion  
of the word order of the clause then 
may look l ike as shown in (10). 
\[verb_first clause \] == p i rs t :  \[finite_verb \] 1 
L rest : \[middle_field and rest fields " 
\[verbsecond_clause \] == ~f i ret :  \[forefield \] 1 
L rest : \[verb_first_clause ?

est : \[after field \]

V 
r first : \[ verbal modifier 1 
est : \[after field \] 
\[verbal modifier \] == \[complement \] 
V \[adjunct \] " 
The f irst def in i t ion  in (i0) descr ibes  
the fact that a clause is e i ther  a 
verb- f i rs t  clause, a verb -second clau- 
se or a verb- last  clause. The next 
three def in i t ions  descr ibe the word 
c rder wi th in  these kinds of c lauses . 
The def in i t ions  of verb- f i rs t  and 
verb -second clauses are quite simple, 
spec i fy ing  only the types of the f irst 
and rest features of the respect ive  
syntact ic  lists. The def in i t ion  of 
verb- last  c lauses expresses the fact 
that they can consist  either of a ver-  
bal mod i f ie r  fo l lowed by (the rest of 
the) verb- last  clause, or of a f inite 
verb, which cannot be fo l lowed by any 
syntact ic  mater ia l  11 . The last four 
def in i t ions  express actua l ly  the 
"field" approach to the German sent- 
ence. The first of them states that 
the foref ie ld  consists  of a verbal 
modif ier,  which, in turn, is def ined 
as be ing e i ther  a complement  or an ad- 
junct (in the last def in i t ion) .  The 
speci f icat ion of midd le  f ie ld (and 
cont ingent fo l lowing parts of the 
clause) says that the it can contain 
first of all any verbal  modi f i -  
ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTKS, 23-28 Aotrr 1992 1 8 8 PROC. OF COLING-92, NANTES. AUG. 23-28, 1992 
er fo l lowed by (the rest of the) mid- 
dle f ie ld or that it can be empty or 
that it can contain a nonf in i te  verb 
fo l lowed by an afterf ie ld.  Finally, 
the a f ter f ie ld  is def ined e i ther  as 
empty or as conta in ing a verbal  modi-  
f ier fo l lowed by (the rest of the) af- 
terf ie ld.  Some c lar i f icat ion of the 
general  idea should be brought  in by 
the structure (12) for the sentence 
(Ii). Here, as well  as in the struct-  
ures that follow, only the most spe- 
cif ic deducib le sorts are given for a 
type (e.g., with the const i tuent  Hans 
the sort con~lement is used rather 
than the sort forefield, because 
co~plement is more spec i f ic  than fore- 
field).

The previous example showed a 
re lat ive ly  simple case where the num- 
ber of elements ("fields" of the 
clause) to be ordered was low and more 
or less given in advance, and their  
o rder ing  absolute (e.g., foref ie ld  
first, f inite verb second, midd le f ie ld  
th i rd etc.). However, the descr ipt ive  
power of the approach is not l imited 
to this: cases where the number of 
e lements  is not given be forehand and 
their  order ing is not absolute can be 
coped with, too, as well  as cases of 
word order combining the two kinds of 
requirements.  For more deta i ls  see 
(Oliva, 1992). 
The pr incipal  achievement of the 
approach presented is the (re)intro- 
duct ion of local i ty into b inary 
branch ing  structures a l lowing for re- 
p lac ing the more standard but in this 
case unsu i tab le  concept of order ing 
constra ints  holding for sister 
const i tuents  by a very s imi lar  concept 
of order ing constraints ho ld ing for a 
list of const ituents.  However,  the in- 
t roduct ion  of l ists al lows also for 
eas iness  of express ing d i f ferent  other 
techniques of descr ib ing word order 
arld its variations, such as the "topo- 
logical" approach d iscussed above 12 or 
the "systemic ordering" as worked out 
by Prague l inguists (e.g., Sgall et 
ai . ,1986) etc. Worth cons iderat ion  is 
also the relat ion of this approach 
based on typing of l ists of surface 
const i tuents  (expressing thus i.a. 
also their  ob l iqueness hierarchy) to 
the "<<"-type of LP-rules of the 
s tandard HPSG, which, unl ike the 
approach discussed, force ob l iqueness  
of complements to be expressed  re- 
peated ly  within the subcategor izat ion  
list of each head. 
The appl icab i l i ty  of tile method 
of descr ipt ion of word order as dis- 
cussed in this paper has been proved 
by using it success fu l ly  in an exper i -  
menta l  grammar of German deve loped in 
the STUF '91 forlaalism with in the i?Log 
project.

especia l ly  as to the posit ion of d i f ferent  
adjuncts. 
3 This is not to say that this p rob lem is 
not latent also in the approaches pre- 
sented by Uszkoreit  and Gunji  - they just 
use the clause-f inal  posit ion of the verb 
in German and Japanese (i.e., a phenomenon 
from the f ixed-word-order sphere) which 
helps to cover it. 
4 Though in HPSG the formal d i f ference 
between the two is removed due to the 
existence of the feature d trs 
(daughters), the intuit ive d i f ference of 
course remains. 
5 For this reason, the term syntactlo llst 
will be used later in this paper as an 
equivalent  of the term b inary  branc~Ltng 
syntactic structure. 
6 In the present paper, the term type is 
used for what is usual ly cal led also a 
feature structure, an att r ibute-va lue 
matr ix etc. The term sort will be used for 
kinds of feature structures, i.e. for what 
is sometimes used to be cal led type (of a 
feature structure). This convent ion will 
be used consequent ly and should not, thus, 
cause n~sunderstanding. Both types and 
sorts create their  respective lattices, in 
pr inciple independent f rom each other. 
This al lows for using operators &, v and 
not for creat ing unif ication, d is junct ion 
and complement, respectively, of types and 
sorts. In the fol lowing examples, types 
will be given as attr ibute-value matr ices 
enclosed in square brackets, and sorts as 
subscripts in ital ics of these brackets.  
7 Reme~r  that the pr inc ip le in the form 
of an impl icat ion appl ies only if the 
left -hand side of the impl icat ion unif ies 
with the structure the pr inc ip le  should 
apply on; note also that in the part icu lar  
case formulated here, the HFP could have 
been s impl i f ied into a conjunct ion of a 
non- impl icat ion and an impl icat ion parts. 
8 No form of HFP appl ies on the empty list 
no inher i tance of features between 
mother and head daughter can occur there, 
obviously. 
9 Notwithstanding the part icu lar izat ion 
(four impl icat ions instead of one in 
standard HPSG), this stil l should be 
t reated as a pr inc ip le  - it is a genera- 
l izat ion holding across kinds of phrases 
(NP's, irP's etc.). 
i0 Typically, but not necessari ly,  conca- 
tenation. 
iI Two short remarks seem to be needed on 
this spot. First, here the fact that in 
German the clause cannot be const i tu ted  by 
a f inite verb alone, is to be coped in 
other parts of the grantmar (e.g., by the 
subcategor izat ion of the verb). Second, 
the fact that no afterf ie ld is a l lowed in 
verb- last  clauses in this example is an 
arbi trary decision, having l i tt le to do 
with the general express ive power of the 
presented approach, and even less with 
grammar of "real" German. 
12 Of part icu lar  importance on this spot 
seem to be the facts that on the approach 
sketched it is natural ly  possib le to speak 
about, e.g., the middlef ie l  d, giving to 
this term also a c lear-cut formal ized 
treatment bot without forcing it to occur 
as a true const ituent in the descript ion, 
as well as the poss ib i l i ty  to specify the 
posit ion of the verb in verb- f i rst  and 
verb-second German clauses without re- 
tort ing to any kind of "movement" 
mechanism (e.g., to SLASH).
