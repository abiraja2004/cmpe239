Abstract
Inferring the information structure of scien-
tific documents is useful for many down-
stream applications. Existing feature-based
machine learning approaches to this task re-
quire substantial training data and suffer from
limited performance. Our idea is to guide
feature-based models with declarative domain
knowledge encoded as posterior distribution
constraints. We explore a rich set of discourse
and lexical constraints which we incorporate
through the Generalized Expectation (GE) cri-
terion. Our constrained model improves the
performance of existing fully and lightly su-
pervised models. Even a fully unsupervised
version of this model outperforms lightly su-
pervised feature-based models, showing that
our approach can be useful even when no la-
beled data is available.
1 Introduction
Techniques that enable automatic analysis of the in-
formation structure of scientific articles can help sci-
entists identify information of interest in the grow-
ing volume of scientific literature. For example,
classification of sentences according to argumenta-
tive zones (AZ) ? an information structure scheme
that is applicable across scientific domains (Teufel
et al, 2009) ? can support information retrieval, in-
formation extraction and summarization (Teufel and
Moens, 2002; Tbahriti et al, 2006; Ruch et al,
2007; Liakata et al, 2012; Contractor et al, 2012).
Previous work on sentence-based classification of
scientific literature according to categories of infor-
mation structure has mostly used feature-based ma-
chine learning, such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (e.g.
(Teufel and Moens, 2002; Lin et al, 2006; Hiro-
hata et al, 2008; Shatkay et al, 2008; Guo et al,
2010; Liakata et al, 2012)). Unfortunately, the per-
formance of these methods is rather limited, as indi-
cated e.g. by the relatively low numbers reported by
Liakata et al (2012) in biochemistry and chemistry
with per-class F-scores ranging from .18 to .76.
We propose a novel approach to this task in which
traditional feature-based models are augmented with
explicit declarative expert and domain knowledge,
and apply it to sentence-based AZ. We explore two
sources of declarative knowledge for our task - dis-
course and lexical. One way to utilize discourse
knowledge is to guide the model predictions by en-
coding a desired predicted class (i.e. information
category) distribution in a given position in the doc-
ument. Consider, for example, sentence (1) from the
first paragraph of the Discussion section in a paper:
(1) In time, this will prove to be most suitable for
detailed analysis of the role of these hormones in
mammary cancer development.
Although the future tense and cue phrases such as
?in time? can indicate that authors are discussing fu-
ture work (i.e. the ?Future work? class in the AZ
scheme), in this case they refer to their own contri-
bution (i.e. the ?Conclusion? class in AZ). As most
authors discuss their own contribution in the begin-
ning of the Discussion section and future directions
in the end, encoding the desired class distribution as
a function of the position in this section can guide
the model to the right decision.
Likewise, lexical knowledge can guide the model
928
through predicted class distributions for sentences
that contain specific vocabulary. Consider, for ex-
ample, sentence (2):
(2) The values calculated for lungs include the
presumed DNA adduct of BA and might thus be
slightly overestimated.
The verb ?calculated? usually indicates the
?Method? class, but, when accompanied by the
modal verb ?might?, it is more likely to imply that
authors are interpreting their own results (i.e. the
?Conclusion? class in AZ). This can be explicitly
encoded in the model through a target distribution
for sentences containing certain modal verbs.
Recent work has shown that explicit declaration
of domain and expert knowledge can be highly use-
ful for structured NLP tasks such as parsing, POS
tagging and information extraction (Chang et al,
2007; Mann and McCallum, 2008; Ganchev et al,
2010). These works have encoded expert knowledge
through constraints, with different frameworks dif-
fering in the type of constraints and the inference
and learning algorithms used. We build on the Gen-
eralized Expectation (GE) framework (Mann and
McCallum, 2007) which encodes expert knowledge
through a preference (i.e. soft) constraints for pa-
rameter settings for which the predicted label distri-
bution matches a target distribution.
In order to integrate domain knowledge with a
features-based model, we develop a simple taxon-
omy of constraints (i.e. desired class distributions)
and employ a top-down classification algorithm on
top of a Maximum Entropy Model augmented with
GE constraints. This algorithm enables us to break
the multi-class prediction into a pipeline of consecu-
tive, simpler predictions which can be better assisted
by the encoded knowledge.
We experiment in the biological domain with the
eight-category AZ scheme (Table 1) adapted from
(Mizuta et al, 2006) and described in (Contractor
et al, 2012). The results show that our constrained
model substantially outperforms a baseline uncon-
strained Maximum Entropy Model. While this type
of constrained models have previously improved
the feature-based model performance mostly in the
weakly supervised and domain adaptation scenarios
(e.g. (Mann and McCallum, 2007; Mann and Mc-
Callum, 2008; Ganchev et al, 2010)), we demon-
strate substantial gains both when the Maximum En-

2 Previous work
Information structure analysis The information
structure of scientific documents (e.g. journal ar-
ticles, abstracts, essays) can be analyzed in terms
of patterns of topics, functions or relations observed
in multi-sentence scientific text. Computational ap-
proaches have mainly focused on analysis based
on argumentative zones (Teufel and Moens, 2002;
Mizuta et al, 2006; Hachey and Grover, 2006;
Teufel et al, 2009), discourse structure (Burstein et
al., 2003; Webber et al, 2011), qualitative dimen-
sions (Shatkay et al, 2008), scientific claims (Blake,
2009), scientific concepts (Liakata et al, 2010) and
information status (Markert et al, 2012).
Most existing methods for analyzing scientific
text according to information structure use full
supervision in the form of thousands of manu-
ally annotated sentences (Teufel and Moens, 2002;
Burstein et al, 2003; Mizuta et al, 2006; Shatkay
et al, 2008; Guo et al, 2010; Liakata et al, 2012;
Markert et al, 2012). Because manual annotation is
prohibitively expensive, approaches based on light
supervision are now emerging for the task, including
those based on active learning and self-training (Guo
et al, 2011) and unsupervised methods (Varga et al,
2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2012). Unfortunately,
these approaches do not reach the performance level
of fully supervised models, let alne exceed it. Our
novel method addresses this problem.
Declarative knowledge and constraints Previ-
ous work has shown that incorporating declara-
tive constraints into feature-based machine learning
929
models works well in many NLP tasks (Chang et
al., 2007; Mann and McCallum, 2008; Druck et al,
2008; Bellare et al, 2009; Ganchev et al, 2010).
Such constraints can be used in a semi-supervised or
unsupervised fashion. For example, (Mann and Mc-
Callum, 2008) shows that using CRF in conjunction
with auxiliary constraints on unlabeled data signif-
icantly outperforms traditional CRF in information
extraction, and (Druck et al, 2008) shows that using
declarative constraints alone for unsupervised learn-
ing achieves good results in text classification. We
show that declarative constraints can be highly use-
ful for the identification of information structure of
scientific documents. In contrast with most previous
works, we show that such constraints can improve
the performance of a fully supervised model. The
constraints are particularly helpful for identifying
low-frequency information categories, but still yield
high performance on high-frequency categories.
3 Maximum-Entropy Estimation and
Generalized Expectation (GE)
In this section we describe the Generalized Expecta-
tion method for declarative knowledge encoding.
Maximum Entropy (ME) The idea of General-
ized Expectation (Dud??k, 2007; Mann and McCal-
lum, 2008; Druck et al, 2008) stems from the prin-
ciple of maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957; Pietra and
Pietra, 1993) which raises the following constrained
optimization problem:
max
p
H(?)
subject to Ep[f(?)] = Ep?[f(?)]
p(?) ? 0
?
p(?) = 1, (1)
where p?(?) is the empirical distribution, p(?) is a
probability distribution in the model and H(?) is the
corresponding information entropy, f(?) is a collec-
tion of feature functions, and Ep[f(?)] and Ep?[f(?)]
are the expectations of f with respect to p(?) and
p?(?). An example of p(?) could be a conditional
probability distribution p(y|x), and H(?) could be
a conditional entropy H(y|x). The optimal p(y|x)
will take on an exponential form:
p?(y|x) =
1
Z?
exp(? ? f(x, y)), (2)
where ? is the Lagrange multipliers in the corre-
sponding unconstrained objective function, and Z?
is the partition function. The dual problem be-
comes maximizing the conditional log-likelihood of
labeled data L (Berger et al, 1996):
max
?
?
(xi,yi)?L
log(p?(yi|xi)), (3)
which is usually known as a Log-linear or Maximum
Entropy Model (MaxEnt).
ME with Generalized Expectation The objec-
tive function and the constraints on expectations in
(1) can be generalized to:
max
?
?
?
x
p?(x)D(p?(y|x)||p0(y|x))
? g(Ep?(x)[Ep?(y|x)[f(x, y)|x]]), (4)
where D(p?||p0) is the divergence from p? to a base
distribution p0, and g(?) is a constraint/penalty func-
tion that takes empirical evidence Ep?(x,y)[f(x, y)] as
a reference point (Pietra and Pietra, 1993; Chen et
al., 2000; Dud??k, 2007). Note that a special case of
this is MaxEnt where p0 is set to be a uniform distri-
bution, D(?) to be the KL divergence, and g(?) to be
an equality constraint.
The constraint g(?) can be set in a relaxed manner:
?
k
1
2?2k
(Ep?(x)[Ep?(y|x)[fk(x, y)|x]]? Ep?(x,y)[fk(x, y)])
2,
which is the logarithm of a Gaussian distribution
centered at the reference values with a diagonal co-
variance matrix (Pietra and Pietra, 1993), and the
dual problem will become a regularized MaxEnt
with a Gaussian prior (?k = 0, ?2k =
1
?2k
) over the
parameters:
max
?
?
(xi,yi)?L
log(p?(yi|xi))?
?
k
?2k
2?2k
(5)
Such a model can be further extended to include
expert knowledge or auxiliary constraints on unla-
beled data U (Mann and McCallum, 2008; Druck et
al., 2008; Bellare et al, 2009):
max
?
?
(xi,yi)?L
log(p?(yi|xi))?
?
k
?2k
2?2k
? ?g?(Ep?(y|x)[f
?(x, y)]) (6)
where f?(?) is a collection of auxiliary feature func-
tions on U , g?(?) is a constraint function that takes
expert/declarative knowledge Ep?(y|x)[f
?(x, y)] as a
reference point, and ? is the weight of the auxiliary
GE term.
930
The auxiliary constraint g?(?) can take on many
forms and the one we used in this work is an L2
penalty function (Dud??k, 2007). We trained the
model with L-BFGS (Nocedal, 1980) in supervised,
semi-supervised and unsupervised fashions on la-
beled and/or unlabeled data, using the Mallet soft-
ware (McCallum, 2002).
4 Incorporating Expert Knowledge into
GE constraints
We defined the auxiliary feature functions ? the ex-
pert knowledge on unlabeled data as1:
f?k (x, y) = 1(xk,yk)(x, y),
such that Ep?(y|x)[fk(x, y)] = p
?(yk|xk), (7)
where 1(xk,yk)(x, y) is an indicator function, and
p?(yk|xk) is a conditional probability specified in
the form of
p?(yk|xk) ? [ak, bk] (8)
by experts. In particular, we took
p?(yk|xk) =
?
?
?
ak if p?(yk|xk) < a
bk if p?(yk|xk) > b
p?(yk|xk) if a ? p?(yk|xk) ? b
(9)
as the reference point when calculating g?(?).
We defined two types of constraints: those based
on discourse properties such as the location of a sen-
tence in a particular section or paragraph, and those
based on lexical properties such as citations, refer-
ences to tables and figures, word lists, tenses, and
so on. Note that the word lists actually contain both
lexical and semantic information.
To make an efficient use of the declarative knowl-
edge we build a taxonomy of information structure
categories centered around the distinction between
categories that describe the authors? OWN work and
those that describe OTHER work (see Section 5). In
practice, our model labels every sentence with an
AZ category augmented by one of the two cate-
gories, OWN or OTHER. In evaluation we consider
only the standard AZ categories which are part of
the annotation scheme of (Contractor et al, 2012).
1Accordingly, Ep?(y|x)[fk(x, y)] = p?(yk|xk)

mation categories at different levels of the information structure

The constraints in Table 2(a) refer to the top level
of this taxonomy: distinction between the authors?
own work and the work of others, and the constraints
in Tables 2(b)-(c) refer to the bottom level of the tax-
onomy: distinction between AZ categories related to
the authors? own work (Table 2(b)) and other?s work
(Table 2(c)).
The first and second columns in each table refer
to the y and x variables in Equation (8), respectively.
The functions Target(?), Forward(?) and Backward(?)
refer to the property value for the target, next and
preceding sentence, respectively. If their value is 1
then the property holds for the respective sentence,
if it is 0, the property does not hold. In some cases
the value of such functions can be greater than 1,
meaning that the property appears multiple times in
the sentence. Terms of the form {w|w?{wi}} refer
to any word/bi-grams that have the same sense aswi,
where the actual word set we use with every example
word in Table 2 is described in Table 3.
For example, take constraints (1) and (4) in Table
2(a). The former is a standard discourse constraint
that refers to the probability that the target sentence
describes the authors? own work given that it appears
in the last of the ten parts in the paragraph. The lat-
ter is a standard lexical constraint that refers to the
probability that a sentence presents other people?s
work given that it contains any words in {we, our,
present study} and that it doesn?t contain any words

in {previous, previously, recent, recently}. Our con-
straint set further includes constraints that combine
both types of information. For example, constraint
(12) in Table 2(b) refers to the probability that a sen-
tence discusses future work given that it appears in
the last of the ten parts of the section (discourse) and
that it contains at least one word in {will, future, fur-
ther, need, remain} (lexical).
5 Top-Down Model
An interesting property of our task and domain is
that the available expert knowledge does not directly
support the distinctions between AZ categories, but
it does provide valuable indirect guidance. For ex-
ample, the number of citations in a sentence is only
useful for separating the authors? work from other
people?s work, but not for further fine grained dis-
tinctions between zone categories. Moreover, those
constraints that are useful for making fine grained
distinctions between AZ categories are usually use-
ful only for a particular subset of the categories only.
For example, all the constraints in Table 2(b) are
conditioned on the assumption that the sentence de-
scribes the authors? own work.
To make the best use of the domain knowledge,
we developed a simple constraint taxonomy, and ap-
ply a top-down classification approach which uti-
lizes it. The taxonomy is presented in Figure 1. For
classification we trained three MaxEnt models aug-
mented with GE constraints: one for distinguishing
between OWN and OTHER2, one for distinguishing
between the AZ categories under the OWN auxiliary
category and one for distinguishing between the AZ
categories under the OTHER auxiliary category. At
test time we first apply the first classifier and based
on its prediction we apply either the classifier that
distinguishes between OWN categories or the one
that distinguishes between OTHER categories.
2For the training of this model, each training data AZ cate-
gory is mapped to its respective auxiliary class.

6 Experiments
Data We used the full paper corpus used by Contrac-
tor et al (2012) which contains 8171 sentences from
50 biomedical journal articles. The corpus is anno-
tated according to the AZ scheme described in Table
1. AZ describes the logical structure, scientific argu-
mentation and intellectual attribution of a scientific
paper. It was originally introduced by Teufel and
Moens (2002) and applied to computational linguis-
tics papers, and later adapted to other domains such
as biology (Mizuta et al, 2006) ? which we used in
this work ? and chemistry (Teufel et al, 2009).
Table 4 shows the AZ class distribution in full ar-
ticles as well as in individual sections. Since section
names vary across scientific articles, we grouped
similar sections before calculating the statistics (e.g.
Discussion and Conclusions sections were grouped
under Discussion). We can see that although there is
a major category in each section (e.g. CON in Dis-
cussion), up to 36.5% of the sentences in each sec-
tion still belong to other categories.
Features We extracted the following features
from each sentence and used them in the feature-
based classifiers: (1) Discourse features: location in
the article/section/paragraph. For this feature each
text batch was divided to ten equal size parts and the
corresponding feature value identifies the relevant
part; (2) Lexical features: number of citations and
references to tables and figures (0, 1, or more), word,
bi-gram, verb, and verb class (obtained by spectral
clustering (Sun and Korhonen, 2009)); (3) Syntac-
tic features: tense and voice (POS tags of main and
auxiliary verbs), grammatical relation, subject and
object. The lexical and the syntactic features were
extracted for the represented sentence as well as for
its surrounding sentences. We used the C&C POS
tagger and parser (Curran et al, 2007) for extract-
ing the lexical and the syntactic features. Note that
all the information encoded into our constraints is
also encoded in the features and is thus available to
the feature-based model. This enables us to properly
evaluate the impact of our modeling decision which
augments a feature-based model with constraints.
Baselines We compared our model against four
baselines, two with full supervision: Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy Mod-
els (MaxEnt), and two with light supervision: Trans-

Parameter tuning The boundaries of the ref-
erence probabilities (ak and bk in Equation (8))
were defined and optimized on the development data
which consists of one third of the corpus. We con-
sidered six types of boundaries: Fairly High for
1, High for [0.9,1), Medium High for [0.5,0.9),
Medium Low for [0.1,0.5), Low for [0,0.1), and
Fairly Low for 0.
Evaluation We evaluated the precision, recall and
F-score for each category, using a standard ten-fold
cross-validation scheme. The models were tested on
each of the ten folds and trained on the rest of them,
and the results were averaged across the ten folds.
7 Results
We report results at two levels of granularity. We
first provide detailed results for the Discussion sec-
tion which should be, as is clearly evident from Ta-
ble 4, the most difficult section for AZ prediction as
only 63.5% of its sentences take its most dominant
class (CON). As we show below, this is also where
our constrained model is most effective. We then
show the advantages of our model for other sections.

ter understanding of the nature of the challenge we
face, Table 5 shows the F-scores of fully- and semi-
supervised SVM and MaxEnt on the Discussion sec-
tion. The dominant zone category CON, which ac-
counts for 63.5% of the section sentences, has the
highest F-scores for all methods and scenarios. Most
of the methods also identify the second and the third
most frequent zones BKG and CN, but with relatively
lower F-scores. Other low-frequency categories can
hardly be identified by any of the methods regardless
of the amount of labeled data available for training.
Note that the compared models perform quite sim-
ilarly. We therefore use the MaxEnt model, which

is most naturally augmented with GE constraints, as
the baseline unconstrained model.
When adding the GE constraints we observe a
substantial performance gain, in both the fully and
the lightly supervised cases, especially for the low-
frequency categories. Table 6 presents the F-scores
of MaxEnt with and without GE constraints (?Max-
Ent+GE (Top-down)? and ?MaxEnt?) in the light
and full supervision scenarios. Incorporating GE
into MaxEnt results in a substantial F-score im-
provement for all AZ categories except for the ma-
jor category CON for which the performance is kept
very similar. In total, MaxEnt+GE (Top-down) is
934
better in 44 out of the 48 cases presented in the table.
Importantly, the constrained model provides sub-
stantial improvements for both the relatively high-
frequency classes (BKG and CN which together label
30.2% of the sentences) and for the low-frequency
classes (which together label 6.4% of the sentences).
The table also clearly demonstrates the impact of
our tree-based top-down classification scheme, by
comparing the Top-down version of MaxEnt+GE
to the standard ?Flat? version. In 39 out of 48
cases, the Top-down model performs better. In some
cases, especially for high-frequency categories and
when the amount of training data increases, un-
constrained MaxEnt even outperforms the flat Max-
Ent+GE model. The results presented in the rest of
the paper for the MaxEnt+GE model therefore refer
to its Top-down version.
All sections We next turn to the performance of
our model on the three other sections. Our exper-
iments show that augmenting the MaxEnt model
with domain knowledge constraints improves per-
formance for all the categories (either low or high
frequency), except the major section category, and
keep the performance for the latter on the same level.
Figure 2 demonstrates this pattern for the lightly su-
pervised case with 150 training sentences but the
same pattern applies to all other amounts of training
data, including the fully supervised case. Naturally,
we cannot demonstrate all these cases due to space
limitations. The result patterns are very similar to
those presented above for the Discussion section.
Unsupervised GE We next explore the quality of
the domain knowledge constraints when used in iso-
lation from a feature-based model. The objective
function of this model is identical to Equation (6)
except that the first (likelihood) term is omitted. Our
experiments reveal that this unsupervised GE model
outperforms standard MaxEnt for all the categories
except the major category of the section, when up
to 150 training sentences are used. Table 7 demon-
strates this for the Discussion section. This pattern
holds for the other scientific article sections. Even
when more than 150 labeled sentences are used, the
unsupervised model better detects the low frequency
categories (i.e. those that label less than 10% of
the sentences) for all sections. These results provide
strong evidence for the usefulness of our constraints
even when they are used with no labeled data.
Model component analysis We finally analyze
the impact of the different types of constraints on
the performance of our model. Table 8 presents the
Discussion section performance of the constrained
model with only one or the full set of constraints.
Interestingly, when the feature-based model is fully
trained the application of the lexical constraints
alone results in a very similar performance to the
application of the full set of lexical and discourse
constraints. It is only in the lightly supervised case
where the full set of constraints is required and re-
sults in the best performing model.
8 Conclusions and Future Work
We have explored the application of posterior dis-
course and lexical constraints for the analysis of the
information structure of scientific documents. Our
results are strong. Our constrained model outper-
forms standard feature-based models by a large mar-
gin in both the fully and the lightly supervised cases.
Even an unsupervised model based on these con-
straints provides substantial gains over feature-based
models for most AZ categories.
We provide a detailed analysis of the results
which reveals a number of interesting properties of
our model which may be useful for future research.
First, the constrained model significantly outper-
forms its unconstrained counterpart for low-medium
frequency categories while keeping the performance
on the major section category very similar to that of
the baseline model. Improved modeling of the major
category is one direction for future research. Sec-
ond, our full constraint set is most beneficial in the
lightly supervised case while the lexical constraints
alone yield equally good performance in the fully
supervised case. This calls for better understand-
ing of the role of discourse constraints for our task
as well as for the design of additional constraints
that can enhance the model performance either in
combination with the existing constraints or when
separately applied to the task. Finally, we demon-
strated that our top-down tree classification scheme
provides a substantial portion of our model?s impact.
A clear direction for future research is the design of
more fine-grained constraint taxonomies which can
enable efficient usage of other constraint types and
can result in further improvements in performance.
