Abstract
Aphasia treatment for the recovery of lost
communication functionalities is possible
through frequent and intense speech therapy
sessions. In this sense, speech and language
technology may provide important support in
improving the recovery process. The aim of
the project Vithea (Virtual Therapist for Apha-
sia Treatment) is to develop an on-line sys-
tem designed to behave as a virtual thera-
pist, guiding the patient in performing train-
ing exercises in a simple and intuitive fashion.
In this paper, the fundamental components of
the Vithea system are presented, with particu-
lar emphasis on the speech recognition mod-
ule. Furthermore, we report encouraging au-
tomatic word naming recognition results using
data collected from speech therapy sessions.
1 Introduction
Aphasia is a communication disorder that can af-
fect various aspects of language, including hearing
comprehension, speech production, and reading and
writing fluency. It is caused by damage to one or
more of the language areas of the brain. Many times
the cause of the brain injury is a cerebral vascular
accident (CVA), but other causes can be brain tu-
mors, brain infections and severe head injury due
to an accident. Unfortunately, in the last decades
the number of individuals that suffer CVAs has dra-
matically increased, with an estimated 600.000 new
cases each year in the EU. Typically, a third of
these cases present language deficiencies (Pedersen
et al, 1995). This kind of language disorder in-
volves countless professional, family and economic
problems, both from the point of view of the individ-
ual and the society. In this context, two remarkable
considerations have led to the development of the
Portuguese national project Vithea (Virtual Thera-
pist for Aphasia treatment).
First are the enormous benefits that speech and
language technology (SLT) may bring to the daily
lives of people with physical impairment. Informa-
tion access and environment control are two areas
where SLT has been beneficially applied, but SLT
also has great potential for diagnosis, assessment
and treatment of several speech disorders (Hawley
et al, 2005). For instance, a method for speech in-
telligibility assessment using both automatic speech
recognition and prosodic analysis is proposed in
(Maier et al, 2009). This method is applied to the
study of patients that have suffered a laryngotomy
and to children with cleft lip and palate. (Castillo-
Guerra and Lovey, 2003) presents a method for
dysarthria assessment using features extracted from
pathological speech signals. In (Yin et al, 2009), the
authors describe an approach to pronunciation veri-
fication for a speech therapy application.
The second reason for undertaking the Vithea
project is that several aphasia studies have demon-
strated the positive effect of speech therapy activi-
ties for the improvement of social communication
abilities. These have focused on specific linguistic
impairments at the phonemic, semantic or syntac-
tic levels (Basso, 1992). In fact, it is believed more
and more that the intensity of speech therapy pos-
itively influences language recovery in aphasic pa-
tients (Bhogal et al, 2003).
These compelling reasons have motivated the de-
1
velopment of an on-line system for the treatment
of aphasic patients incorporating recent advances in
speech and language technology in Portuguese. The
system will act as a ?virtual therapist?, simulating an
ordinary speech therapy session, where by means of
the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tech-
nology, the virtual therapist will be able to recognize
what was said by the patient and to validate if it was
correct or not. As a result of this novel and special-
ized stimulation method for the treatment of aphasia,
patients will have access to word naming exercises
from their homes at any time, which will certainly
cause an increase in the number of training hours,
and consequently it has the potential to bring signif-
icant improvements to the rehabilitation process.
In section 2 we provide a brief description of dif-
ferent aphasia syndromes, provide an overview of
the most commonly adopted therapies for aphasia,
and describe the therapeutic focus of our system.
Section 3 is devoted to an in depth description of
the functionalities that make up the system, while
section 4 aims at detailing its architecture. Finally,
section 5 describes the automatic speech recognition
module and discusses the results achieved within the
automatic naming recognition task.
2 About the aphasia disorder
2.1 Classification of aphasia
It is possible to distinguish two different types of
aphasia on the basis of the fluency of the speech pro-
duced: fluent and non-fluent aphasia. The speech
of someone with fluent aphasia has normal articula-
tion and rhythm, but is deficient in meaning. Typi-
cally, there are word-finding problems that most af-
fect nouns and picturable action words. Non-fluent
aphasic speech is slow and labored, with short ut-
terance length. The flow of speech is more or less
impaired at the levels of speech initiation, the find-
ing and sequencing of articulatory movements, and
the production of grammatical sequences. Speech is
choppy, interrupted, and awkwardly articulated.
Difficulty of recalling words or names is the most
common language disorder presented by aphasic in-
dividuals (whether fluent or non-fluent). In fact, it
can be the only residual defect after rehabilitation of
aphasia (Wilshire and Coslett, 2000).
2.2 Common therapeutic approaches
There are several therapeutic approaches for the
treatment of the various syndromes of aphasia. Of-
ten these methods are focused on treating a specific
disorder caused from aphasia. The most commonly
used techniques are output focused, such as the stim-
ulation method and the Melodical Intonation Ther-
apy (MIT) (Albert et al, 1994). Other methods are
linguistic-oriented learning approaches, such as the
lexical-semantic therapy or the mapping technique
for the treatment of agrammatism. Still, several
non-verbal methods for the treatment of some se-
vere cases of non-fluent aphasia, such as the visual
analog communication, iconic communication, vi-
sual action and drawing therapies, are currently used
(Sarno, 1981; Albert, 1998).
Although there is an extensive list of treatments
specifically designed to recover from particular dis-
orders caused by aphasia, one class of rehabilita-
tion therapy especially important aims to improve
the recovery from word retrieval problems, given the
widespread difficulty of recalling words or names.
Naming ability problems are typically treated with
semantic exercises like Naming Objects or Naming
common actions (Adlam et al, 2006). The approach
typically followed is to subject the patient to a set of
exercises comprising a set of stimuli in a variety of
tasks. The stimuli are chosen based on their seman-
tic content. The patient is asked to name the subject
that has been shown.
2.3 Therapeutic focus of the Vithea system
The focus of the Vithea system is on the recovery
of word naming ability for aphasic patients. So far,
experiments have only been made with fluent apha-
sia patients, but even for this type of aphasia, major
differences may be found. Particularly, patients with
Transcortical sensorial aphasia, Conduction aphasia
and Anomic aphasia (Goodglass, 1993) have been
included in our studies.
Although the system has been specifically de-
signed for aphasia treatment, it may be easily
adapted to the treatment or diagnosis of other dis-
orders in speech production. In fact, two of the
patients that have participated in our experimen-
tal study were diagnosed with acquired apraxia of
speech (AOS), which typically results from a stroke,

tumor, or other known neurological illness or injury,
and is characterized by inconsistent articulatory er-
rors, groping oral movements to locate the correct
articulatory position, and increasing errors with in-
creasing word and phrase length.
3 The Vithea System
The overall flow of the system can be described as
follows: when a therapy session starts, the virtual
therapist will show to the patient, one at a time, a
series of visual or auditory stimuli. The patient is
required to respond verbally to these stimuli by nam-
ing the contents of the object or action that is repre-
sented. The utterance produced is recorded, encoded
and sent via network to the server side. Here, a web
application server receives the audio file via a servlet
that serves as an interface to the ASR system, which
takes as input the audio file encoding the patient?s
answer and generates a textual representation of it.
This result is then compared with a set of predeter-
mined textual answers (for that given question, of
course) in order to verify the correctness of the pa-
tient?s input. Finally, feedback is sent back to the
patient. Figure 1 shows a comprehensive view of
this process.
The system comprises two specific modules, dedi-
cated respectively to the patients for carrying out the
therapy sessions and to the clinicians for the admin-
istration of the functionalities related to them. The
two modules adhere to different requirements that
have been defined for the particular class of user for
which they have been developed. Nonetheless they
share the set of training exercises, that are built by
the clinicians and performed by the patients.
3.1 Speech therapy exercises
Following the common therapeutic approach for
treatment of word finding difficulties, a training ex-
ercise is composed of several semantic stimuli items.
The stimuli may be of several different types: text,
audio, image and video. Like in ordinary speech
therapy sessions, the patient is asked to respond to
the stimuli verbally, describing the imaging he/she
sees or completing a popular saying (which was pre-
sented verbally or in text).
Exercise categories
The set of therapeutic exercises integrated in
Vithea has been designed by the Language Research
Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Neuro-
science of the Lisbon Faculty of Medicine (LEL).
LEL has provided a rich battery of exercises that can
be classified into two macro-categories according to
the main modality of the stimulus, namely:
A) Image or video: Naming object picture, Naming
of verbs with action pictures, and Naming verbs
given pictures of objects.
B) Text or speech: Responsive Naming, Complete
Sayings, Part-whole Associations, What name
is given to. . . , Generic Designation, Naming by
function, Phonological Evocation, and Seman-
tics Evocation.
Exercises can be also classified according to
Themes, in order to immerse the individual in a prag-
matic, familiar environment: a) Home b) Animals
c) Tools d) Food e) Furniture f) Professions g) Ap-
pliances h) Transportation i) Alive/Not Alive j) Ma-
nipulable/Not Manipulable k) Clothing l) Random.
Evaluation exercises
In addition to the set of training exercises, which
are meant to be used on a daily basis by the apha-
sic patient, the Vithea system also supports a dif-
ferent class of exercises: Evaluation Exercises. Un-
like training exercises, evaluation exercises are used
by human therapists to periodically assess the pa-
tient?s progress and his/her current degree of apha-
sia via an objective metric denoted as Aphasia Quo-
tient (AQ). Evaluation exercises are chosen from a
3
subset of the previously mentioned classes of ther-
apeutic exercises, namely: Naming object picture,
Naming of verbs with action pictures, and Naming
verbs given pictures of objects.
3.2 Patient Module
The patient module is meant to be used by aphasic
individuals to perform the therapeutic exercises.
Visual design considerations
Most of the users for whom this module is in-
tended have had a CVA. Because of this, they may
have some forms of physical disabilities such as re-
duced arm mobility, and therefore they may experi-
ence problems using a mouse. Acknowledging this
eventuality, particular attention has been given to the
design of the graphical user interface (GUI) for this
module, making it simple to use both at the presen-
tation level and in terms of functionality provided.
Driven by the principle of accessibility, we designed
the layout in an easy to use and understand fashion,
such that the interaction should be predictable and
unmistakable.
Moreover, even though aphasia is increasing in
the youngest age groups, it still remains a predomi-
nant disorder among elderly people. This age group
is prone to suffer from visual impairments. Thus,
we carefully considered the graphic elements cho-
sen, using big icons for representing our interface
elements. Figure 2 illustrates some screenshots of
the Patient Module on the top.
Exercise protocol
Once logged into the system, the virtual therapist
guides the patient in carrying out the training ses-
sions, providing a list of possible exercises to be per-
formed. When the patient choses to start a training
exercise, the system will present target stimuli one
at a time in a random way. After the evaluation of
the patient?s answer by the system, the patient can
listen again to his/her previous answer, record again
an utterance (up to a number of times chosen before
starting the exercise) or pass to the next exercise.
Patient tracking
Besides permitting training sessions, the patient
module has the responsibility of storing statistical
and historical data related to user sessions. User ut-
terances and information about each user access to
the system are stored in a relational database. Par-
ticularly, start and end time of the whole training
session, of a training exercise, and of each stimulus
are collected. On the one hand, we log every access
in order to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of
the program by seeing the frequency with which it
is used. On the other hand, we record the total time
needed to accomplish a single stimulus or to end a
whole exercise in order to estimate user performance
improvements.
3.3 Clinician Module
The clinician module is specifically designed to al-
low clinicians to manage patient data, to regulate
the creation of new stimuli and the alteration of the
existing ones, and to monitor user performance in
terms of frequency of access to the system and user
progress. The module is composed by three sub-
modules: User, Exercise, Statistic.
User sub-module
This module allows the management of a knowl-
edge base of patients. Besides basic information
related to the user personal profile, the database
also stores for each individual his/her type of apha-
sia, his/her aphasia severity (7-level subjective scale)
and AQ information.
Exercise sub-module
This module allows the clinician to create, update,
preview and delete stimuli from an exercise. An ex-
ercise is composed of a varying number of stimuli.
In addition to the canonical valid answer, the system
accepts for each stimulus an extended word list com-
prising three extra valid answers. This list allows the
system to consider the most frequent synonyms and
diminutives.
Since the stimuli are associated with a wide as-
sortment of multimedia files, besides the manage-
ment of the set of stimuli, the sub-module also pro-
vides a rich Web based interface to manage the
database of multimedia resources used within the
stimuli. Figure 2c shows a screenshot listing some
multimedia files. From this list, it is possible to se-
lect a desired file in order to edit or delete it.
In this context, a preview feature has also been
provided. The system is capable of handling a wide
range of multimedia encoding: audio (accepted file

types: wav, mp3), video (accepted file types: wmv,
avi, mov, mp4, mpe, mpeg, mpg, swf), and images
(accepted file types: jpe, jpeg, jpg, png, gif, bmp, tif,
tiff).
Given the diversity of the various file types ac-
cepted by the system, a conversion to a unique file
type was needed, in order to show them all with only
one external tool. Audio files are therefore converted
to mp3 file format, while video files are converted to
flv file format.
Finally, a custom functionality has been designed
to create new stimuli in an intuitive fashion similar
in style to a WYSIWYG editor. Figure 2d illustrates
the stimuli editor, showing how to insert a multime-
dia resource.
Statistics sub-module
This module allows the clinician both to monitor
statistical information related to user-system inter-
actions and to access the utterances produced by the
patient during the therapeutic sessions. The statisti-
cal information comprises data related to the user?s
progress and to the frequency with which users ac-
cess the system. On the one hand, we provide all
the attempts recorded by the patients in order to
allow a re-evaluation by clinicians. This data can
be used to identify possible weaknesses or errors
from the recognition engine. On the other hand, we
thought that monitoring the utilization of the appli-
cation from the users could be an important piece of
feedback about the system?s feasibility. This is moti-
vated by common concerns about the fact that some
users abandon their therapeutic sessions when they
are not able to see quick results in terms of improve-
ments.
4 Architectural Overview
Considering the aforementioned requirements and
features that will make up the system, Learning
Management Systems (LMSs) software applications
were initially considered. LMSs automate the ad-
5
ministration of training events, manage the log-in of
registered users, manage course catalog, record data
from learners and provide reports to the manage-
ment (Aydin and Tirkes, 2010). Thus, an in-depth
evaluation of the currently widespread solutions was
carried out (Pompili, 2011). Concretely, eight differ-
ent LMSs (Atutor, Chamilo, Claroline, eFront, Ilias,
Moodle, Olat, Sakai) were studied in detail. Unfor-
tunately, the outcome of this study revealed impor-
tant drawbacks.
The main problem noticed is that LMSs are typi-
cally feature-rich tools that try to be of general pur-
pose use, sometimes resulting in the loss of their
usefulness to the average user. Often the initial user
reaction to the interface of these tools is confusion:
the most disorienting challenge is figuring out where
to get the information needed. As previously men-
tioned, patients who have had a CVA may experi-
ence physical deficiencies, thus the Vithea system
needs an easy to use and understandable interface.
We dedicated some effort trying to personalize LMS
solutions, but most of them do not allow easy sim-
plification of the presentation layout.
Moreover, while there were several differences
between the functionalities that the evaluated LMSs
provided in terms of training exercises, they all pre-
sented various limitations in their implementation.
Eventually, we had to acknowledge that it would
have been extremely complex to customize the eval-
uated frameworks to meet the Vithea project require-
ments without introducing major structural changes
to the code.
Besides, the average user for whom the Vithea
system is intended is not necessarily accustomed
with computers and even less with these tools, which
in most cases are developed for environments such
as universities or huge organizations. This means
that our users may lack the technical skills neces-
sary to work with an LMS, and the extra effort of
understanding the system would result in a loss of
motivation.
Therefore, considering the conclusions from this
study, we have opted to build a modular, portable
application which will totally adhere to our require-
ments. With these purposes in mind, the system has
been designed as a multi-tier web application, being
accessible everywhere from a web browser. The im-
plementation of the whole system has been achieved
by integrating different technologies of a heteroge-
neous nature. In fact, the presentation tier exploits
Adobe R?Flash R?technology in order to support rich
multimedia interaction. The middle tier comprises
the integration of our own speech recognition sys-
tem, AUDIMUS, and some of the most advanced
open source frameworks for the development of web
applications, Apache Tiles, Apache Struts 2, Hiber-
nate and Spring. In the data tier, the persistence
of the application data is delegated to the relational
database MySQL. This is where the system main-
tains information related to patient clinical data, ut-
terances produced during therapeutic sessions, train-
ing exercises, stimuli and statistical data related both
to the frequency with which the system is used, and
to the patient progress.
4.1 Speech-related components of the system
Audio Recorder
In order to record the patient?s utterances, the
Vithea system takes advantage of opportunities of-
fered by Adobe R?Flash R?technology. This allows
easy integration in most browsers without any re-
quired extra plugin, while avoiding the need for se-
curity certificates to attest to the reliability of an
external component running in the client machine
within the browser. This choice was mainly moti-
vated from the particular kind of users who will use
the system, allowing them to enjoy the advantages
of the virtual therapist without the frustration of ad-
ditional configuration. A customized component has
been developed following the aforementioned prin-
ciples of usability in terms of designing the user in-
terface. Keeping simplicity and understandability
as our main guidelines, we used a reduced set of
large symbols and we tried to keep the number of
interactions required to a bare minimum. Therefore,
recording and sending an utterance to the server re-
quires only that the patient starts the recording when
ready, and then stops it when finished. Another ac-
tion is required to play back the recorded audio.
Automatic Speech Recognition Engine
AUDIMUS is the Automatic Speech Recognition
engine integrated into the Vithea system. The AU-
DIMUS framework has been developed during the
last years of research at the Spoken Language Pro-
cessing Lab of INESC-ID (L2F), it has been success-
6
fully used for the development of several ASR appli-
cations such as the recognition of Broadcast News
(BN) (Meinedo et al, 2010). It represents an essen-
tial building block, being the component in charge
of receiving the patient answers and validating the
correctness of the utterances with respect to the ther-
apeutic exercises. In the following section, this spe-
cific module of the Vithea architecture is assessed
and described in more detail.
5 The Vithea speech recognition module
5.1 The AUDIMUS hybrid speech recognizer
AUDIMUS is a hybrid recognizer that follows the
connectionist approach (Boulard and Morgan, 1993;
Boulard and Morgan, 1994). It combines the tem-
poral modeling capacity of Hidden Markov Mod-
els (HMMs) with the pattern discriminative classi-
fication of multilayer perceptrons (MLP). A Markov
process is used to model the basic temporal nature
of the speech signal, while an artificial neural net-
work is used to estimate posterior phone probabili-
ties given the acoustic data at each frame. Each MLP
is trained on distinct feature sets resulting from dif-
ferent feature extraction processes, namely Percep-
tual Linear Predictive (PLP), log-RelAtive SpecTrAl
PLP (RASTA-PLP) and Modulation SpectroGram
(MSG).
The AUDIMUS decoder is based on the Weighted
Finite State Transducer (WFST) approach to large
vocabulary speech recognition (Mohri et al, 2002).
The current version of AUDIMUS for the Euro-
pean Portuguese language uses an acoustic model
trained with 57 hours of downsampled Broadcast
News data and 58 hours of mixed fixed-telephone
and mobile-telephone data (Abad and Neto, 2008).
5.2 Word Naming Recognition task
We refer to word recognition as the task that per-
forms the evaluation of the utterances spoken by the
patients, in a similar way to the role of the thera-
pist in a rehabilitation session. This task represents
the main challenge addressed by the virtual ther-
apist system. Its difficulty is related to the utter-
ances produced by aphasic individuals that are fre-
quently interleaved with disfluencies like hesitation,
repetitions, and doubts. In order to choose the best
approach to accomplish this critical task, prelimi-
nary evaluations were performed with two sub-sets
of the Portuguese Speech Dat II corpus. These con-
sist of word spotting phrases using embedded key-
words: the development set is composed of 3334
utterances, while the evaluation set comprises 481
utterances. The number of keywords is 27. Two dif-
ferent approaches were compared: the first based
on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition
(LVCSR), the second based on the acoustic match-
ing of speech with keyword models in contrast to
a background model. Experimental results showed
promising performance indicators by the latter ap-
proach, both in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER),
False Alarm (FA) and False Rejection (FR). Thus,
on the basis of these outcomes, background model-
ing based keyword spotting (KWS) was considered
more appropriate for this task.
Background modeling based KWS
In this work, an equally-likely 1-gram model
formed by the possible target keywords and a com-
peting background model is used for word detec-
tion. While keyword models are described by their
sequence of phonetic units provided by an auto-
matic grapheme-to-phoneme module, the problem
of background modeling must be specifically ad-
dressed. The most common method consists of
building a new phoneme classification network that
in addition to the conventional phoneme set, also
models the posterior probability of a background
unit representing ?general speech?. This is usually
done by using all the training speech as positive ex-
amples for background modeling and requires re-
training the acoustic networks. Alternatively, the
posterior probability of the background unit can be
estimated based on the posterior probabilities of the
other phones (Pinto et al, 2007). We followed the
second approach, estimating the posterior probabil-
ity of a garbage unit as the mean probability of the
top-6 most likely outputs of the phonetic network at
each time frame. In this way there is no need for
acoustic network re-training. Then, a likelihood-
dependent decision threshold (determined with tele-
phonic data for development) is used to prune the
best recognition hypotheses to a reduced set of sen-
tences where the target keyword is searched for.

5.3 Experiments with real data
Corpus of aphasic speech
A reduced speech corpus composed of data col-
lected during therapy sessions of eight different pa-
tients has been used to assess the performance of
the speech recognition module. As explained above,
two of them (patients 2 and 7) were diagnosed with
AOS. Each of the sessions consists of naming ex-
ercises with 103 objects per patient. Each object is
shown with an interval of 15 seconds from the pre-
vious. The objects and the presentation order are the
same for all patients. Word-level transcription and
segmentation were manually produced for the pa-
tient excerpts in each session, totaling 996 segments.
The complete evaluation corpus has a duration of ap-
proximately 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Evaluation criteria
A word naming exercise is considered to be com-
pleted correctly whenever the targeted word is said
by the patient (independently of its position, amount
of silence before the valid answer, etc...). It is
worth noticing that this is not necessarily the crite-
rion followed in therapy tests by speech therapists.
In fact, doubts, repetitions, corrections, approxima-
tion strategies and other similar factors are usually
considered unacceptable in word naming tests, since
their presence is an indicator of speech pathologies.
However, for the sake of comparability between a
human speech therapist evaluation and an automatic
evaluation, we keep this simplified evaluation crite-
rion. In addition to the canonical valid answer to
every exercise, an extended word list containing the
most frequent synonyms and diminutives has been
defined, for a total KWS vocabulary of 252 words.
Only answers included in this list have been ac-
cepted as correct in both manual and automatic eval-
uation.
Results
Word naming scores are calculated for each
speaker as the number of positive word detections
divided by the total number of exercises (leftmost
plot of Figure 3). The correlation between the hu-
man evaluation assessed during ordinary therapeu-
tic sessions and the automatic evaluation assessed
with the word recognition task has resulted in a Per-
son?s coefficient of 0.9043. This result is considered
quite promising in terms of global evaluation. As
concerning individual evaluations (rightmost plot of
Figure 3), it can be seen that the system shows re-
markable performance variability in terms of false
alarms and misses depending on the specific patient.
In this sense, the adaptation to the specific user pro-
file may be interesting in terms of adjusting the sys-
tem?s operation point to the type and level of apha-
sia. As a preliminary attempt to tackle the cus-
tomization issue, the word detector has been indi-
vidually calibrated for each speaker following a 5-
fold cross-validation strategy with the correspond-
ing patient exercises. The calibration is optimized to
the minimum false alarm operation point for patients
with high false-alarm rates (2, 3, 4, 5 and 8) and to
the minimum miss rate for patients with a high num-
ber of misses (1, 6 and 7). Figure 4 shows results for
this customized detector. In this case, the correlation
between human and automatic evaluation is 0.9652
and a more balanced performance (in terms of false
alarm and false rejection ratios) is observed for most
speakers.

Analysis of word detection errors
The most common cause for false alarms is the
presence of many ?invented? nonexistent words
without semantic meaning, which are very often
phonetically very close to the target words. These
paraphasic errors were present in all types of fluent
aphasia and AOS that we have observed, but not for
all patients. In many of these errors, the stressed syl-
lable is often pronounced right, or at least its rhyme.
As the typical stress pattern in Portuguese is in the
penultimate syllable, most often the last syllable is
also pronounced correctly (e.g. borco / porco). In
patients that try to say the word by approximation,
that is, by successive attempts to get closer to the
target word, but using only existent words, the dif-
ferences between the percentages of miss and false
alarms are not so remarkable.
One characteristic of aphasic patients that some-
times causes keywords to be missed (both when cor-
rectly or incorrectly pronounced) is pauses in be-
tween syllables. This may justify the inclusion of
alternative pronunciations, in case such pronuncia-
tions are considered acceptable by therapists. Ad-
ditionally, more sophisticated speech tools may also
be integrated, such as tools for computing the good-
ness of pronunciation (Witt, 1999). This would al-
low a different type of assessment of the pronuncia-
tion errors, which may provide useful feedback for
the therapist and the patients.
6 Conclusions and future work
6.1 Conclusions
This paper described how automatic speech recog-
nition technology has contributed to build up a sys-
tem that will act as a virtual therapist, being capa-
ble of facilitating the recovery of people who have a
particular language disorder: aphasia. Early experi-
ments conducted to evaluate ASR performance with
speech from aphasic patients yielded quite promis-
ing results.
The virtual therapist has been designed follow-
ing relevant accessibility principles tailored to the
particular category of users targeted by the system.
Special attention has been devoted to the user in-
terface design: web page layout and graphical ele-
ments have been chosen keeping in mind the possi-
bility that a user may experience reduced arm mobil-
ity and the technology that has been integrated was
selected with the idea of minimizing possible diffi-
culties in using the system. A pedagogical approach
has been followed in planning the functionalities of
the virtual therapist. This has been mainly driven
by the fundamental idea of avoiding an extra feature
rich tool which could have resulted in frustration for
some patients, who seek help for recovery and do
not need to learn how to use complex software.
Overall, since the system is a web application, it
allows therapy sessions anywhere at anytime. Thus,
we expect that this will bring significant improve-
ments to the quality of life of the patients allowing
more frequent, intense rehabilitation sessions and
thus a faster recovery.
6.2 Future work
The Vithea system has recently achieved the first
phase of a project which still entails several im-
provements. Even though, Naming objects and Nam-
ing common actions are the most commonly used
exercises during the rehabilitation therapies, the sys-
tem has been designed to allow a more comprehen-
sive set of therapeutic exercises which will be im-
plemented during the next refinement phase. Also,
at this stage, we plan to make available the current
version of the system to real patients in order to re-
ceive effective feedback on the system.
In the subsequent improvement phase, we will in-
tegrate the possibility of providing help, both seman-
tic and phonological to the patient whenever the vir-
tual therapist is asked for. Hints could be given both
in the form of a written solution or as a speech syn-
thesized production based on Text To Speech (TTS).
Furthermore, we are considering the possibility of
incorporating an intelligent animated agent that to-
gether with the exploitation of synthesized speech,
will behave like a sensitive and effective clinician,
providing positive encouragements to the user.
