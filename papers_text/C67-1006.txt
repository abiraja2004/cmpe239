SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC PROBLEMS IN AUTOMATIC SENTENCE GENERATION, ~ ~ O~#/  
Kenneth E. Harper ~/v{~/..~.-.~ 
A program for automatic sentence generation (ASG) has been deve loped~cJ /~, . r  
in the linguistic group at The RAND Corporation, as a device for study- / ~  / 
ing selected problems in syntax and distributional semantics. The 
general purpose of the study is to test certain linguistic assumptions 
by experimentation:" what is the result when a computer program "com- 
poses" sentences on the basis of these assumptions? The assumptions, 
and their implementation in the computer program, are subject to mod- 
ification, as deficiencies are observed in the output sentences. This 
trial-and-error procedure is presently at an early stage of develop- 
ment; the present paper is a brief, non-technical description of the 
procedure, and a report on some of the initial problems encountered, 
together with tentative solutions. The ultimate goal of the research 
is the generation of "paragraphs" (meaningful strings of sentences) 
as a contribution towards automatic abstracting. 
i. The Sentence Generation Routine 
The ASG program operates with Russian language materials, for the 
simple reason that the kind of data on which the linguistic assump- 
tions are based is available only for Russian. The data is derived 
from the corpus of Russian physics text processed at The RAND Corpora- 
tion (References i, 2). In effect, the program described here deals 
with a sub-set of the Russian language found in these physics texts. 
The program may be said to consist of three parts: a glossary of 
words, a granlnar, and a program for synthesizing sentences. 
(i) The glossary is merely a list of 550 Russian words on magnetic 
tape; each entry consists of a "word number" (the word-identification 
number in the RAND physics glossary), (Reference 3) and a representa- 
tive Russian form (not necessarily the canonical form). The glossary 
comes into operation only at the end of the sentence generation rou- 
tine. Generally, the words in the glossary are used in a single sense 
in physics texts. 
(ii) The~r~ar  employed is a simplified dependency grannnar for 
Russian. Its essential feature is that it is word-specific: each 
word in the glossary is provided a list of words with which it may 
combine in a dependency or governor relationship. The basic prin- 
ciple is that syntactic cooccurrence (e.g., the pairing of a given 
noun with a given adjective) is allowed only if this pairing is at- 
tested in the previously processed physics text. (An exception is 
made in the pairing of members of Semantic Classes, as explained be- 
low.) 
The following information, available for each word in the glossary, 
may be said to constitute the grammar: 
i )  Word number 
2) Part-of-speech code. Six such codes are used: VT (transitive 
verb), Vl (intransitive verb), N (noun), A (adjective), DV (ad- 
verb), and DS (sentence adverb). A word may bear only one such 
code. 
3) Semantic Class code (SC). Twenty such classes are recognized; 
all are distributionally formed. (References 4, 5) 
4) Set of governing probabilities 
5) Set of dependent probabilities 
6) Coordinate probability 
- I - 
7) Li~t of word nmnbers of governors 
8) List of word numbers of dependents 
9) List of word numbers of coordinates 
Table i illustrates the meanlngof governing probabilities. Reading 
across the top line in the table, we see that each VT has a probabil- 
ity of Pl "of governing some noun as subject and a probability of i of 
governing some noun as object. The VT has probabilities of P~ and Pq 
of governing an adverb and a sentence adverb respectively, an~ a pro: 
bability of 0 of governing anything else. The table shows also that 
each VI must govern a noun as subject, and governs a DV and DS with 
probabilities PA and P. respectively; each noun governs another noun 
or an adjective-with p~obabilities P~ and P.; a DS has a probability 
of i of governing a noun; adjectives-and adverbs never govern. 
Table 2 shows the meaning of dependent probabilities; here, reading 
across, the various probabilities of being governed by other parts- 
of-speech are shown for nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and sentence ad- 
verbs; verbs do not have governors. 
The sets of governing probabilities for a word are associated with 
independent situations. For example, a transitive verb governs a 
noun as subject, a noun as object, an adverb and a sentence adverb 
independently. Therefore, in sentence generation, the decision to 
select a dependent type will be made without regard to any dependent 
types already selected for that governor. This is not the case, how- 
ever, when selecting a governor for a particular word. The possibil- 
ities here are dependent events. An adverb, for example, must be gov- 
erned by either a transitive or intransitive verb. Thus, the set of 
probabilities for each word will add to one. 
Probabilities for coordination are assigned for relatively few words. 
Since coordinate conjunctions are not represented as a word class, the 
assignment of a Russian form for "and" and "or" will be generated by 
the program (rather than by the glossary) in the sentence output stage. 
As previously mentioned, each word is accompanied by a list of the 
word nombers that may function as its governors and dependents. Gen- 
erally, these dependency pairs have been attested in physics text. 
However, a Semantic Class may also function as a word's governor or 
dependent; when this happens, the program is free to choose randomly 
any member of the SC in building the dependency pair. Many such pairs 
will not have been attested in text; the purpose here is to test the 
adequacy of the Semantic Classes in word combination. A complete list 
of the SC's cannot be given here; examples are (a) nouns that name 
physical properties ("height," "weight"), ~) verbs and nouns referr- 
ing to a quantitative change ("to increase," "change"), and (c) the 
names of physical particles ("atom," "proton"). The classes, and 
their members, are purely experimental and are subject to modification. 
(iii) The ~rogram for ASG (written in MAP for the IBM 7044) is intri- 
cately bound up with the grarmnar, but for purposes of discussion we 
may consider it separately. Essentially, the program has three func- 
tions. First, it restructures the grammar, in order to access I tw l th  
minimal search time. (The grau~ar and the program are maintained in 
core storage.) Secondly, the program generates sentences; beginning 
at some arbitrary point, it proceeds, pair-wise, up and down the tree

structure until a terminal point is reached. In the process, the al- 
gorithm provides that decisions of two kinds will be made at each node: 
(~ shall a dependent (or governor) be chosen for the word at this node, 
and (ii) if so, which word shall be chosen to complete the dependency 
pair? The grammar supplies the basic information necessary for making 
decisions; a pseudo-random number generator with uniform distribution 
is used in conjunction with the grammar when a choice exists. Final- 
ly, the program prints out the generated sentences in a fixed format. 
In their preliminary form, the sentences are merely strings of word 
numbers, together with associated data; glossary lookup then provides 
the transliterated Russian form associated with each word number. At 
present, the problem of morphology is bypassed: no attempt is made 
to supply the correct inflection of words in the sentence. The infor- 
mation necessary to carry out an inflection routine is available for 
nouns and adjectives (i.e., inflection for case and number); for verbs, 
person and number are specified, but tense is not. In the sentences 
discussed below, correct forms for nouns, verbs and adjectives have 
been supplied for reasons of clarity. 
An example will perhaps serve to clarify the operation of the ASG pro- 
gram. In a greatly simplified way, the algorithm proceeds as fol- 
lows. 
(i) A starting point is chosen for the sentence. Possible starting 
points are transitive verb (VT), intransitive verb (VI), and noun 
(N). By random selection, VI is chosen for this sentence. 
(2) Randomly, a particular VI is chosen from the list of Vl's in the 
glossary. Here, we assume that word number 56410 is chosen. 
(3) The possible dependent types of a VI are considered. (Accord- 
ing to the gran~nar, verbs do not have governors, so that only de- 
pendents need be considered.) 
(3.1) The grammar specifies that a VI must have a subject (the prob- 
ability P is one for this pairing). The list of dependents serving 
as subject for word number 56410 is consulted, and an individual word 
is randomly chosen: word nomber 34550. 
(3.2) A Vl may have an adverb (DV) as dependent. For the verb in 
our sentence, the probability for this event is found to be .5. We 
assume that in this sentence the decision is made that a DV will be 
selected. The list of dependent DV's for word number 56410 is con- 
suited, and an individual adverb is randomly selected: word number 
14090. 
(3.3) A VI may have a sentence adverb (DS) as a dependent. For our 
particular verb, the probability for this event is found to be .i. 
We assume that a decision in made not to select a DS dependent. 
(4) Next, the dependents of the dependents of the verb are consider- 
ed, but only with respect to their possible dependents (i.e., work ing 
down the dependency tree structure). 
(4.1) The noun chosen as subject (word 34550, from 3.1 above) may 
have various dependents, with varying probabilities. Each of these 
is considered in turn. For sake of brevity, we assume that only one 
-4 -  
is chosen in our ss~nple sentence: an adjective. A particular ad- 
jective is randomly selected from the list of dependents for the noun: 
word number 63610. 
(5) The adverb selected in 3.2 above has no dependents, according 
to the grammar, nor does the adjective selected in 4.1. At this point, 
the downward search for dependents is terminated, and the sentence is 
considered complete. 
In form, the sentence is at this point a string of word numbers on a 
tape: 56410, 34550, 14090, 63610. Attached to each word n~nber is 
data about its function in the sentence, its governor, the order in 
which it was selected, and, for nouns, an indication of grammatical 
number. Glossary lookup is then performed on this tape, and the trans- 
literated Russian forms are printed out: uvellcennoe otnosenle 
zametna ~ta. 
If fixed rules relating to word order and morphology are applied to 
to this string of forms, the sentence emerges as: 
Eto otnosenie zametno uveli~ivaetsja. 
This ratio increases noticeably. 
The foregoing is a drastically abbreviated description of the main 
steps in the ASG program. Sentences are presently generated at the 
rate of three per second; the addition of programming rules to ac- 
count for morphology and word order would increase this time by an 
estimated ten percent. The program may, then, be considered as a 
practical, operational tool for research. 
~. Discussion of Generated Sentences 
At the present stage of development, the ASG program produces iso- 
lated sentences of varying degrees of complexity and ~fcorreetness." 
Since words in the glossary are limited in usage to one sense, and 
since semantic controls are guaranteed at least over pairs of words, 
a large number of sentences are quite acceptable. (The development 
of a context into which such sentences can be placed is, naturally, 
a far more difficult programming task.) The following are examples 
of ~freasonable" sentences. 
(i) Fejnman vy~islil integraly, s cel'ju opredelenija massy. 
Feynman calculated the integrals in order to determine the 
mass. 
(2) Re~enie zada~ predlagaetsja v nastoja~ej stat'e. 
A solution of the problems is proposed in the present article. 
(3) Ob~mkr is ta l lov  izbyto~nogo serebra bystro umen'~aetsja. 
The volume of the crystals of excess silver rapidly decreases. 
(4) Vozmo~nost' sil'nogo vzaimodejstvija tela vne~nego " istocnika 
privlekaet interes. 
The possibility of the strong interaction of the body of the 
internal source is interesting. 
Sentence (4) illustrates the approximate limit in number of levels 
-5 -  
(six) for "reasonable" sentences in the present system. Additional 
levels can easily be generated, but only through the process of an- 
nexing genitive noun modifiers (i.e., English "of" phrases). Very 
few sentences have been generated with more than six levels, princi- 
pally because of the drastically reduced probabilities of noun com- 
plementatlon at lower levels in the tree. Thus, most sentences are 
short , The chief obstacle to increasing sentence length (and com- 
plexity) is, however, the absence in the grannnar of provisions for 
subordinate and coordinate clauses. Also inhibiting, from this 
point of view, i s the absence of participles, prepositional phrases 
(beyond those used as adverbs), and pronouns. The price for adding 
any of these grammatical categories is increased complexity in the 
program. In an experimental situation, brevity and stylistic monot- 
ony can be tolerated. 
Deficiencies in the generated sentences are of two main types: syn- 
tactic and semantic. Problems in both areas will be illustrated, 
although the line of demarcation is so~aetimes difficult to draw. 
Syntactic problems are chiefly the result of inadequate complementa g 
tion of nouns by adjectives or other nouns. It will be recalled that 
the gran~nar specifies for each noun the probability of its modifica- 
tion by an adjective or a genitive noun. These probabilities are as- 
signed on the basis of the noun's behavior in text (Refernce 6). 
Since P is normally less than one for both kinds of modification, a 
given noun may frequently appear in a generated sentence without 
modification: 
(5) Stepanov ustanovil teorii zada~. 
Stepanov established theories of the problems. 
(6) 
(7) 
(8) 
Formulytipa ispol'zuJutsja. 
Formulae of the t.zp_~ are used. 
Razrjad issledovan pri ras~ete. 
The charge was studied in calculating. 
. . Proverka daet metod polucen13a atoma. 
Verification gives a method for obtaining the atom. 
In (5), the noun phrase, "theories of the problems," appears to be 
ill-formed; the difficulty may not really be syntactic, since in an 
appropriate context the phrase may be nothing more than an instance 
of ellipsis. Nonetheless, specificity as to "what kind of problems" 
should be provided in the given sentence, or in preceding sentences. 
The tmanodified use of "type" in sentence (6) is more difficult to 
justify on the basis of ellipsis; our tentative solution is to __re- 
quire either an adjective or noun modifier for words like "type," 
"kind," etc. (A modification in the program is necessitated here, 
since at present the selection of adjective and noun dependents is 
made independently.) 
The nouns in (7) and (8) are strongly verbal, and appear to be de- 
ficient in complementation. This is particularly true of "ras~ete" 
in (7), translated with the "-ing" form because of its verbal usage 
with the sentence adverb, "pri." It should be said that all sentence 
adverbs in our grammar have the property of conferring a verbal func- 
tion upon noun dependents. (This is, of course, a very limited use 
-6  - 
of sentence modifiers.) In order to maintain consistency inthe 
grammar, it is clear that the program should be modified: the prob- 
ability that a given noun will govern a genitive noun should equal 
one when the noun is itself governed by ~ sentence adverb. 
In general, it is clear that a word's combining potential (i.e., its 
comblnin E probabilities) may be affected by the syntactic environment 
in which it is placed. A generation program that does not take into 
account this possibility will be woefully inadequate. The problem 
is: which syntactic environments affect which words, and under which 
conditions? One use of the ASG program is to generate problems of 
this kind, and to test provisional solutions. 
A second kind of syntactic problem arises when the grammatical num- 
ber of nouns is inappropriate. (At present, the selection of number 
is made by the random number generator, operating on data in the 
grammar about the relative frequency of singular and plural in phy- 
sics text.) Thus, in sentence (7) above, the combination "pri ras- 
~etax" ("in calculations") could have easily been generated, since 
the noun, "ras~et," is frequently used in the plural. The strongly 
verbal nature of the noun in this environment, as noted above, makes 
the use of the singular noun almost imperative. (Deverbative nouns 
are almost never used in the plural when indicating a process.) The 
program should therefore be modified to require that a noun dependent 
of a sentence adverb be singular. 
Two other instances of incorrect~umber in nouns may be mentioned. 
Nouns of the general classification, "abstract collective," require 
that genitive noun dependents be plural (unless the latter noun is 
rarely, or never, plural). Since the grammar contains no such spec- 
ification, the~following ill-formed sentence was generated: 
(9) Cislo ~to~o ~ otsutstvuet. 
A number of this later is absent. 
Other nouns (deverbatives), and their corresponding transitive verbs, 
appear to require that the noun complement be plural. 
(I0) Izu~enie stolknovenij atom__~aopublikovano v predydus~e 3 rabote. 
A study of the collisions of an atom was published in a pre- 
ceding paper. 
The solution to the problem is to modify the grammar so that "col- 
lison," will require the (subjective) genitive noun dependent in 
the plural. (A variation of this principle is '~ultiple comple- 
mentation": "the collision of an atom with (and) another atom." 
Grammatical rules to account for this phenomenon are beyond the 
scope of the present grammar.) 
We conclude that there are no major syntactic problems in the sen- 
tences so far generated, chiefly because the grammar is relatively 
primitive. 
Semantic problems are more difficult to isolate. Again, it is some- 
times possible that the absence of appropriate context is the chief 
cause ofodd-soundinE sentences. 
A trivial kind of error is caused by the inappropriate repetition 
" 7 - 
of a word: 
(ii) Analogi~naja formula i formula zaplsalis'. 
An analogous formula and a formula were written. 
It is easy to forbid the repetition of a word i~a  sentence; such 
a restriction, however, would betoo  severe (cf., for example, "We 
used formula i in deriving formula 2."). In general, it appears 
that recurring words tend to be used in different clauses of the 
sentence. Until the program is capable of producing sentences of 
more than one clause, the best strategy is probably to forbid word 
repetition. 
In some sentences, the choice of adjective modifier appears logl- 
cally inconsistent, or incompatible. 
(12) Molekuly detal'no izuceny, s ce l ' ju ra~_~ i~nerenija. 
The molecules were studied in detail, for the purpose of a 
different measuring. 
The issue here is not the lack of a complement for '~easurlng," but 
the use of "different" with the strongly verbal noun governor. In 
one sense, the difficulty "my be syntactic: "different" would in 
Russian normally be used with a plural noun, whereas a singular noun 
is strongly indicated in the present context. The oddity of the con- 
struction is, thus, partly the result of conflicting "forces" in the 
adjective and the noun. 
Some sentences show the loss of meaning that may\ easily result from 
the expanslon 0f noun phrases by the addition of Ee~itive noun mod- 
ifiers. 
(13) Uravnenie zakonovra_~ada effekta pribli~eni~ pulucenl. 
The equation of the laws of the decay of the effect of approxl- 
matlo_._.____n.nn is obtained. 
The problem here is apparently the use of "effect" in two different 
phrases: "the decay of the (e.g., photoelastic) effect" is the kind 
of phrase found in physics texts, as is "the effect of approxima- 
ting (e.g., the energy)." The confusion in (13) may be explained 
by the fact that the former expression refers to a physical phenom- 
enon, whereas the latter refers to an exercise of the mind; the two 
incompatible phrases are forced together by the fact that "effect" 
is common to both. The anomaly may also be explained, more simply, 
by the different lexlcal properties of "effect." 
A similar problem.my also arise in 
ers in a noun phrase. Thus, in the 
of adjectlve/noun," varying degrees 
the adjectives: 
the use of two adjective modlfl- 
construction, "adjective/noun 
of f ltness.my be observed for

Should some of these combinations be forbidden? If so, on what 
basis? What is the effect of expanding the grammar so that con- 
ditional clauses ("if . . ., then . . .") can be generated? One 
possibility is that adjectives can be semantically classified, so 
that logically incompatible combinations can be avoided. It is 
difficult to estimate whether or not such a path of investigation 
is fruitful. 
At the present stage of research, problems of semantic "interfer- 
ence" have occurred infrequently. The generation of certain problem 
constructions is strongly indicated. For example, the program can be 
modified so as to produce, at a given point, one hundred sentences in 
which the construction, '~oun of noun of noun," appears; likewise, it 
can be required that the second of the three nouns be a specific word 
(e.g., "effect"). From an examination of the output, we hope to gain 
some insight into the question of semantic compatibility.

SUMMARY - Syntactic and Semantic Problems in Automatic Sentence 
Generation 
A computer program for the automatic generation of sentences was 
written, based on a simplified dependency grammar for Russlan and 
a vocabulary of 550 words. Each word is provided a list of al- 
lowable constituents; the structure of a sentence is conditioned 
entirely by the lexical items chosen at each node in the dependency 
tree. Some of the generated sentences exhibit certain syntactic 
deficiencies (nouns are inadequately complemented or are given the 
wrong number); other problems result from the "interference" of. 
semantic fields beyond the context of the word-palr.
