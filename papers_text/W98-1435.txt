1. Several important problems to solve for applying Generation to the real world 
We believe that it is important from the practical point of view to use natural language generation (NLG) 
in real world applications. The key benefits are outlined as follows: 
? Higher quality of generated texts 
? Cost effective maintenance and adaptability 
? Usability?(including acceptability by the users). 
Generally, it takes "exotic" (linguists, knowledge ngineers) manpower to maintain, and adapt a NLG 
system. To avoid this problem, we have developed a Knowledge Administration ? station, which is usable 
by the target population (in our project, weather forecasters). 
On the other hand, the system is designed to help the forecasters and not replace them. It is able to adapt 
to each forecaster's style and manage nhancements? they wish to bring to their texts. With that in mind, 
the Interactive Generation environment was designed to allow forecasters to modify generated texts in 
their native language, and then generate weather forecasts in several foreign languages based on those 
modifications. 
Interactive? Generation is a viable alternative to Automatic Translation. 
2. Mul t iMeteo 
2.1. General motivation 
The European weather forecast market is no longer limited to the national level. Travelling is growing 
rapidly, with an increasing number of people going abroad, for both personal and professional reasons. 
Markets for meteorological forecasts tend to overlap borders and thus need multilingual tools. 
The volumes involved are high, and time constraints for producing fresh usable information are stringent: 
several hundreds of bulletins for each Weather Office, produced several times a day. 
End users have also become? much more demanding about quality and tailoring, which here are realised 
by different styles of weather forecast. 
1.2. Goal and characteristics of MultiMeteo 
The g0al of the MultiMeteo projectis to build an automatic multilingual short-report generation system, 
and to use it in the Meteorology field for producing weather forecasts from structured data I. 
i Other weather-forecast generation systems are FoG \[Goldberg et al 94\], Weathra \[Sigurt et al 92\], MET90 \[Sigurt 
et al 96\], and METEOVIS \[Kerpedjiev & Noncheva 90\]

This system will allow European forecasters to automatically produce texts in English, French, German, 
Spanish, and Dutch. 
MultiMeteo is a 3-year project funded partially by the Language Engineering programme of the European 
Commission, and partially by European weather offices. It involves around 40 people in France, Spain, 
Austria and Belgium. There are around 15 pilot sites in Europe, which are representative of different 
meteorological characteristics (south, north, plain, mountain, sea, etc.). In each site, 3 or 4 styles willbe 
developed (local and regional general public, seaside general public, fun-board sport oriented, etc.). 
3. Interact ive Generat ion and Knowledge Admin is t rat ion 
The Interactive Generation environment allows the user (the forecaster)to: 
? Read the generated text 
? Modify it in terms of concepts, modifiers, links, etc. 
? ? Read the modified version 
The  following example shows a generated text, and the menu proposed by the system when the user 
clicks on a clause (here "le ciel couvert devient peu nuageux") - "the grey sky becomes less cloudy"

In the above menu, alternative concepts are proposed, and several types of modifiers (modality, phase, 
etc.) can be added. 
For example, if. the concept "Eclaircies devenant un peu plus franches" (Sunny spells becoming more 
extensive) is selected, the System generates the following text: 
METEO-FRANCE, centre d~partemental du Mans. Voici le bull~ 
pour la zone de la vallee du Loir.

Once the forecaster saves the result, MultiMeteo generates the weather forecast in all the selected 
? languages (which are English, Spanish and German). Of  course his/her modifications are taken into 
? account i n all of the languages. : 
In addition, MultiMeteo offers a Knowledge Administration station, which allows the administrator to
modify the style of the texts to be generated, in terms o f  default structure, titles, order between 
paragraphs, available models of paragraphs, type of sentences used (telegraphic / non telegraphic), terms 
to be used, etc. 
In fact, there are two levels of administration: central and ?local. Certain functions are specific to the 
central administration, such as the creation of a new style from scratch, or the management of the 
multilingual terminology. ? 
4.  Technica l  Character i s t i cs  
MultiMeteo runs under PC/Windows 95 (or more), Windows NT and Unix station/Solaris2. The input is a 
numerical matrix, where columns are the meteorological parameters and rows are time steps. The output 
is an HTML or RTF file that contains one or more weather forecasts.

The MultiMeteo software has 4 main modules: 
? The Front-End Module (FEM) 
? The Administration Server 
? The Generation Server 
? The Help facilities. 
The FEM, the Administration, and the Help are written in JAVA. 
The Generation Server is based on ERLI's AlethGen toolbox, which has already been used for generating 
texts, in particular for producing correspondence for a leading French mail-order company (see \[Coch 
1996a\] and \[Coch 1996b\]). AlethGen is divided in an engine (written in C++) and Knowledge Bases. The 
approach is inspired by the Meaning-Text Theory
