The e lements of the stock of knowledge shared 
.by the speaker and the hearer change their sal- 
ience, in the sense of being immediate ly  access-  
ible in the bearer 's  memory. The h ierarchy of 
sal ience is argued to be a basic component  of a 
mechan ism serving for the ident i f icat ion of ref-  
erence. Some of the regular i t ies  of this mechan ism 
are discussed,  the descr ipt ion  of which is a nec- 
essary prerequis i te  of an automatic  understand ing 
of connected texts. 
i. When d iscuss ing  the quest ion of what is the main contr ibut -  
ion of computat iona l  l inguist ics  to theoret ica l  l inguist ics  at one 
of the panel  d iscuss ions  at Co l ing 80 in Tokyo, the panel is ts  unan- 
imously pointed to the due emphasis laid on the funct ion of natural  
language in communicat ion.  In this direct ion,  it is known from the 
c lass ica l  Prague School that the topic/ focus ar t i cu la t ion  belongs to 
the most  important  aspects  connect ing the structure of language with 
the condi t ions of its use. However, this ar t icu lat ion  I was not exam- 
ined systemat ica l ly  in most  of the main l inguist ic  trends, so that 
the p ioneers  who are aware of its importance for natural  language 
understand ing (esp. Grosz, 1977, Reichman, 1978, 1981, McKeown, 1979, 
Hirst, 1981) attempt to f ind their  own ways. 
Dur ing the d iscourse the stock of "knowledge" the speaker as- 
sumes to share wi th  the hearer changes accord ing to what is "in the 
centre of attent ion" at the given t ime point. 2 Each utterance has its 
inf luence on this h ierarchy of sal ience; however,  not every ment ion-  
ing of an object  has the same effect. The assumpt ion that the degrees 
of sa l ience const i tute  a part ia l  order ing is corroborated e.g. by the 
degrees of consc iousness  character ized by Chafe (1974). 
Let us denote by x ~ an express ion x re ferr ing to an object  a 
that is sal ient to the -qa- degree n in the stock; since the max imum 
of sa l ience can more easi ly  than other degrees be imagined to be fix- 
ed, we denote it by ~ = ~, revers ing the d i rect ion of"growth" of the 
degrees; to the left (r ight) of the arrow we indicate the state 
immediate ly  preceding (fol lowing) the utterance of a sentence S in 
which x occurs; x c F (T) stands for "x belongs to the focus (~opic) 
of S";--P(x ) denotes that x is expressed either by a weak pronoun 
or Ts d~le~ed in S, though--present in its tectogrammat ica l  represent~ 
at ion (TR);3 with--NP. _(x ) we refer to def in i te  NP's and to such _--~a~e a NP's as one of the N, ~o~ (of the) N. 
Accord ing  to a pre l iminary  empir ica l  invest igat ion it appears 
that : the fo l lowing rules concern ing the degrees of sa l ience obtain

(cf. a f i rst  formulat ion of some of them in Sgall, 1980a, p.240), 
where m, n > ~: 
(i) If P(X_a), then a_n- + a_ n- 
(2) If NP(x a) C \[, then a_ n- ? a~ 
(3) If NPdef(~a)  C ~, then a_n-- + 1 
(4) If a_n-- + a_ m-, then b_ m-+2 obta ins for every ob ject  b that  is 
not  i tsel f  re ferred to in the TR of S, but  is immediate ly  
assoc iated wi th  it (as e.g. teacher  or pupi l  are w i th  
schoo l, or parents  wi th  chi ld, e--t-~..) 
(5) If As for xa, or C0noern in~ x a is present  in S, then 
a ~ + a I ~ 
(6) If ~a is not  inc luded in the TR of S, not even among the 
assoc ia ted  ob jects  (see Rule (4)), then a ~ + a n-+2 
As was po inted out  by Sgal l  (1967a, p.95f.;  198Ob), the d i f fer -  
ence between n = ~ and n = 1 is too small  to make the re ference 
ass ignment  un\ [vocal  <if--such speci f ic  pronouns as Czech ten, German 
der or Engl. the latter are not present) :  If Char les  met  PAUL is 
f-o\[lowed by He wore his HAT, we may only  guess whether  he refers  to 
Paul and his to Char les,  or v ice w~rsa, or whether  a th i rd poss ib i l i -  
ty is present.  However,  whenever  the d i f ference in the degrees of sal- 
ience is greater,  an occurrence of a pronoun or of a de f in i te  NP in 
the next  ut terance regu lar ly  refers  - as we want  to i l lust rate  in the  
sequel  - to that ob ject  which  was referred to as the most  sa l ient  a- 
mong those that meet  the lexical  and grammat ica l  condi t ions  of the 
NP or pronoun <number, gender).  The two main types of the thematic  
progress ions  descr ibed  by Dane~ (1968; 1976) are important  here. A lso  
Hobbs (1976) spec i f ies  a common heur is t ics  for reso lv ing  pronouns,  
wh ich  says that  we should prefer  the subject  to an NP in the ob ject  
pos i t ion  (in other  words, since the subject pos i t ion  in Eng l i sh  
funct ions as a rule as (a part  of) the topic of the sentence, this 
heur is t ics  says that  the t Jpic is pre ferab ly  preserved in success ive 
sentences).  Another  poss ib le  strategy <Hobbs, 1979) inc ludes infer-  
enc ing and factual  knowledge. 
In our ru les some of the re lat ionsh ips  between the sa l ience and 
the pragmat ic  re la t ionsh ips  of lexical  units  are t reated only  in a 
pre l iminary  way. Thus e.g. Rule (4) or a s imi lar  rule should ref lect  
also a rather  common s i tuat ion when a ment ion ing  of a part icu lar  ob- 
ject (or objects)  br ings into foreground only a f ract ion of a set 
of ob jects  that a l ready are in the fore~round of the stock of know- 
ledge. It does not capture the case when the foregrounded object(s)  
belong to a set the act ivat ion  of which has a l ready faded away under 
the threshold  of act ivat ion;  it seems to be a p laus ib le  hypothes is  
that  even in such a case the "rest" of the objects  are being act ivat -  
ed beyond this th resho l~ by ment ion ing  the foregrounded object(s) ,  
even if to a very  low extent. 
2. Let us i l lust rate  the above rules on a f ragment of text; we 
are not concerned wi th  a systemat ic  l inguist ic  analys is  of the g iven 
text here, but we coBcentrate  on the changes of act ivat ion  of the 
e lements of the stock of shared knowledge as re f lected (and induced3 
by the discourse.  We restr ic t  ourse lves  to ob jects  ident i f ied by NP's

\[2b\] but  the teachers did not REPROVE them, 
\[20\] because they were so EXCITED. 
\[3\] Outs ide PARENTS were wait ing.  
\[4\] A group of about  f ive parents  grouped around the MICROPHONE. 
\[5\] One of them should probably  SPEAK, 
\[6\] The teachers  were very SERIOUS. 
\[7\] In fact, ALL ADULTS in the garden were serious. 
\[8\] They were dressed in evening DRESSES.

\[i0\] The smal lest  had even snow-white COLLARS. 
\[lla\] The tall on the contrary  LAUGHED at them, 
\[llb\] because they pretended not to be INTERESTED. 
\[12a\] Their  teachers did not L IKE that, 
\[12b\] whi le  the teachers of the small  were ev ident ly  PROUD.. 
\[13\] The parents  at the microphone d iscussed something in a WHISPER. 
\[14\] Then one of them, a father, stepped FORWARD 
\[,15~ and SAID: 
\[16\] The Society of Fr iends of this school is h ighly  sat is f ied wi th  
the results  of our lowest GRADES. 
\[17\] Then he PAUSED. 
\[18\] Some parents  in the audience began to MURMUR. 
\[i9\] The father at the microphone tr ied to SILENCE them. 
\[20\] He was puzzled.

Commentary  
The fo l lowing comments  are numbered accord ing to the number of the 
c lause to which they refer. We omit  those c lauses the commentary  to 
which fol lows t r iv ia l ly  from the previous comments and from the rules. 
\[I\] In the opening sentence of the text two objects  are introduced: 
the school garden and the chi ldren.  Since the latter object  is ment-  
ioned in the focus of the sentence, it becomes more sal ient  than ob- 
jects ment ioned prev ious ly  or those act ivated by their  presence in 
the broader context  or s ituation. Also the assoc iated objects  such 
as school, pupi ls,  and teachers  are now re la t ive ly  sal ient. 
\[2a\] The ch i ldren as a h ighly sal ient ob ject  in the stock of shared 
knowledge are referred to in the topic pos i t ion  by a pronoun, which  
keeps their  act ivat ion  at  the same degree (see Rule El)), whi le  the 
act ivat ion  of the other ob jects  <Rule (6)) fades away. 
\[2b\] A new object  enters the scene: the teachers.  However,  their  
appearance on the scene is not complete ly  new and surpr is ing,  because 
the hearer has a l ready been introduced into the scene of school, 
which has the teachers  assoc iated with it (see Rule <4)). This  is 
why the teachers can be understood as re fer r ing  to the teachers of 
the ch i ldren and the school which were a l ready ment ioned.  In accord-  
ON THE ROLE OF HIERARCHY OF ACTIVATION 111 
ance wi th  Rule (3) the degree of sal ience of teachers is I. The 
ch i ldren remain on the scene - they are reminded by a pronominal  re- 
ference in the topic and their  act ivat ion  does not fade away (see 
Rule <i)). It should be noted that even though the pronoun them is in 
the f inal  pos i t ion of the sentence, it is preceded by the intonat ion 
centre; it is wel l  known that all part ic ipants  p laced after the inton- 
at ion centre be long to the topic part  of the sentence. 
\[2c\] The pronoun in the topic has an  indist inct  reference:  both teach- 
ers and ch i ldren may be referred to. This ind is t inctness  of re ference 
is d i f f i cu l t  to solve: accord ing to the strategies ment ioned in Sect. 
2 the two objects  are sal ient enough to be referred to by a weak pro- 
noun, and the teachers  as wel l  as the ch i ldren can be excited in the 
given situation, so that not even factual  knowledge with in ferenc ing 
gives a safe clue. The formulat ion of the text  can be character i zed  
as not successfu l  in this point. However, if the lexical  sett ing of 
\[2c\] were changed, as in \[2c ~\] and \[2c''\], the ind is t inctness  would 
disappear,  and only one of the two poss ib le  candidates  of re ference 
would be chosen, namely the teachers in \[2c'\] and the chi ldren \[2c''\]: 
\[2c'\] . . .  because they were always kind to their  pupi ls.  
\[2c''\].. .  because they were too small to understand the ser iousness, . .  
\[3\] A new object  is being introduced in the focus of the sentence; a- 
gain, it can be said that it is not complete ly  new, because it is also 
g iven by the broader scene <of fami ly relat ions:  ch i ldren - parents).  
This newly introduced item receives a very high degree of act ivat ion,  
whi le  the other two objects - the ch i ldren and the teachers - are not 
ment ioned in this sentence at all and thus their  act ivat ion fades 
away (see Rule <6)). 
\[4\] The speaker chooses a subset of the most  act ivated set of e lements 
and speaks about this subset; he introduces a new object  on the scene, 
which receives a high degree of act ivat ion  (see Rule <2)), but since 
it does not appear in any of the fo l lowing utterances,  this act ivat -  
ion later fades away step by step <Rule (6)>. The complement  to the 
set of f ive parents  - the rest of the pa~ents - reta ins the degree of 
a rather high act ivat ion,  see Rule (3). 
\[6\] One of the items the act ivat ion  of which has been fad ing away 
<the teachers)  is back on the scene; the teachers  may be referred to 
by a def in i te  NP in the topic s ince the act ivat ion  has not been low- 
ered under a certa in  threshold,  which would otherwise  lead to an 
expl ic i t  re introduct ion.  
\[~9\] An expl ic i t  re in t roduct ion  of the ch i ldren is preferred by the 
speaker s ince the ch i ldren have not been ment ioned in several  preced-  
ing utterances;  their  act ivat ion  has been lowered considerably.  For 
such strong re -act ivat ion  express ions such as concernin@, as far as 
... is concerned, as for ... are used. 
\[I0\] Only one subset of the ch i ldren is expl ic i t ly  ment ioned in this 
sentence; the act ivat ion  of this item of knowledge is ra ised <Rule 
<3)), but also the complement  subset of pupi ls  is "supported" in its 
act ivat ion  <Rule <i)), which does not fade away as it would be the 
case if no pupi ls  were menuioned at all <Rule <6)). 
\[llb\] The reference of the pronoun ~ is again indist inct;  it may 
refer e i ther to the smal lest  or to the tall  pupils. Nei ther  of the 
strategies ment ioned above helps: both the NP s the tal l  <pupils) 
and the smal lest  <pupils) are in the topic pos i t ion  of \[lla\], and 
both are act ivated to the same extent: the smal lest  pupi ls  were re- 
ferred to in \[lla\] by pronoun them and the act ivat ion 'o f  this i tem 
was preserved <Rule (I)) ; the tall  were ment ioned by a def in i te  NP in 
the topic, which  keeps their  act ivat ion.  This ind is t inctness  remains 
112 E. HAJI~OV~, and S. VRBOV.~ 
unsolved even after the ut terance of \[12a\], which adds another  in- 
d is t inct  reference <their teachers - whose? of the smal lest? of the 
tall?) and it is on ly  after hear ing \[12b\] that the hearer can decide: 
there the expl ic i t  ment ion ing  of the teachers of the small ch i ld ren  
resolves the ind is t inct  re ference of their  in \[12a\] and at the same 
time our factual  knowledge of the wor ld  invites the inference that if 
the small  ch i ldren pretended not to be interested,  their  teachers  
would have noth ing to be proud of, so that they in \[llb\] can refer  
only to the tal l  pupi ls.  
\[16\] The speaker of the d i rect  speech is not ment ioned in the quote 
(only by means of his re ference to the Society of Fr iends of the 
School, of which  he undoubted ly  is a member),  but the act ivat ion  of 
this item does not seem to fade away. This  appears to be a general  
feature of d i rect  speech, wh ich  fol lows from the semant ico -syntact i c  
structure of the d i rect  speech, where the "direct speech c lause" 
funct ions as an ob ject  (Pat ient)  of the in t roductory  c lause (and the 
speaker, as the Actor  of the sentence, belongs to the TR of the same 
sentence).  
\[27\] The use of the courageous chi ld  to refer to the small pupi l  who 
screamed "Hurrah!" of fers  another  example of the in ferenc ing the hear-  
er must  per form in order to understand what is the sentence about and 
to determine the reference,  even in cases where full NP's  rather  than 
pronouns are used. 
It is also easy to ver i fy  that wi th other var iants  of the text 
the weak pronoun they, if it were used after  each of the sentences 
\[5\](e.g. in 6": The ch i ld ren  observed them, ...) , \[6\], \[13\], \[18\], 
etc., would  lack any re ferent ia l  ind ist inctness;  s imi lar ly  for he 
after \[14\] <where, in fact, the pronoun is de leted) , \ [17\ ] ,  \[22\], etc. 
The referent ia l  ind is t inctness  is present  (and must  be solved by 
means of in ferencing)  after such ut terances as e.g. \[2b\], \[9\], \[IO\], 
\[lla\], \[12a\], where objects  with the degrees @ and 1 can be re fer red 
to by the same pronoun. In a s imi lar  wav the ind is t inctness  of the 
reference of nouns can be studied,cf ,  e.g. the use of father in \[19\] 
(synonymous with he, whi le  in \[20\] the pronoun and in \[27\] the noun 
is necessary) .  
3. To conclude,  it should be noted that when speaking about  the 
h ierarchy of sa l ience (act ivat ion)  and of degrees of ac t ivat ion  of 
items of the stock of shared knowledge we do not have in mind an 
absolute scale or l inear order ing  of elements.  The raise or drop of 
act ivat ion  should be a lways taken as re lated to the other i tems of 
the stock. In the rules, we use two kinds of raise: a mi ld  one <Rule 
<3)), and a strong one <Rule (2));  it may be the case that further 
empir ica l  research wi l l  lead us to a more subtle c lass i f icat ion.  
Also, we are aware that this is a point  where l inguist ic  and psycho l -  
ogical  invest igat ions  should go hand in hand. Anyhow, we are cnnvinc-  
ed that such an empir ica l  research,  if guided by an attempt at a more 
expl ic i t  and systemat ic  descr ipt ion,  is of pr imary importance for 
(automatic)  language comprehension,  and as such also for all app l icat -  
ional pro jects  of text understanding.

ON THE ROI.~ OF HIERARCHY OF ACTIVATION 113 
3 The TR of a sentence has the form of a dependency tree, 
labelled by complex symbols with the main predicate as its root; an 
ordering of the nodes is defined with respect to their so-called com- 
municative dynamism, fulfi l l ing the condition of projectivity; for a 
detailed description of TR's in the framework of the functional gen-  
erative description, to which we subscribe, see Sgall (1967a); Haji-
