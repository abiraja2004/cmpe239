ABSTRACT 
We present a comparative analysis of the performance of 
a statistics-based system for the formation of semantic groups 
of adjectives when various sources of linguistic knowledge 
are introduced. We identify four different ypes of slufllow 
linguistic knowledge that are applicable to this system, and 
we quantify the performance gained by incorporating each 
such knowledge module, We perform experiments for dif- 
ferent corpus sizes and different inputs (sets of adjectives to 
group), collect clam on the usaful.ness of each linguistic 
module, assess the statistical significance of the results, and 
compare the contributions of the linguistic knowledge sources 
against each other. We also assess the overall effect linguistic 
knowledge has in our system. Our results how that linguistic 
knowledge causes asignificant increase in the performance of
the system. We conclude by discussing how these positive 
restdts can be generalized to other problems in statistical 
NLP. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The idea of integrating statistical and 
knowledge-based approaches for natural anguage 
problems, has been. recently. . gainin$ ground, in. the 
computational lingmsucs commumty, as it is ex- 
pected that a combined approach will offer sig- 
nificantly better performance over either 
methodology alone. This paper supplements his 
intuitive belief with actual evaluatzon data, ob- 
tained when several linguistics-based modules 
were integrated in a statistical system. 
We used a system we previously developed for 
the separation of adjectives into semantic groups 
\[Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993\] as the 
basis for our comparative analysis. We identified 
several different types of shallow linguistic 
knowledge that can be efficiently introduced into 
our system. We evaluated the system with and 
43 
without each such feature, obtaining an estimate of 
each feature's positive or negative contribution to 
the overall performance. By matching cases where 
all system parameters are the same except for one 
teature, we assess the statistical significance of the 
differences found. Also, a statistical model of the 
system's performance in terms of the active fea- 
tures for each run offers a view of the contribu- 
tions of features from a different angle, contrasting 
the significance of linguistic features (or other 
modeled system parameters) against each other. 
Our analysis of the experimental results 
showed that many forms of li%.uistic knowledge 
have a significant positive conmbution to the per- 
formance of the system. We attribute to the com- 
bined effect of the linguistic knowledge modules 
the ability of our system to perform fine-tuned 
classification of adjectives into semantic lasses. 
Other statistical systems that address word clas- 
sification probleans do not emphasize the use of 
linguistic knowledge and do not deal with a 
specific word class\[Brown et al, 1992\], or do not 
exploit as much linguistic knowledge as we do 
\[Pereira et al, 1993\]. As a result, a coarser clas- 
sification is usually produced. In contrast, by 
limiting the system's input to adjectives, we can 
take advantage of specific syntactic relationships 
and additional faltering procedures that apply only 
to ,particular word classes. These sources of lin- 
gmstic knowledge provide in turn the extra eedgc 
for discriminating among the adjectives at the 
semantic level. 
Our" adjective grouping system can be used for 
applications uch as natural ansuage generation 
(where knowledge of the semanuc groups and of 
the ordering of the elements within them allows 
the precise lexiealization of semantic concepts 
\[Elhadad, 1991\]) and computational lexicography 
(by automatically eompifing domain-dependent 
lists of synonyms and antonyms). The produced 
groups can also help correct erroneous usage of 
multiple qualifiers that are superfluc~ts or con- 
tradict each other, a phenomenon that has been ob- 
served in medical reports 1. But in addition to the 
immediate applications of word classification, 
many other sfatistical NLP applications can be cast 
in a similar framework. Therefore, the positive f- 
fects of linguistic knowledge on our system in- 
dicate that the incorpo/'ation of linguistic 
knowledge will probably result in similar b~efits 
for other applications as well. 
In what follows, we briefly review our adjec- 
tive grouping system, and then present the !ingui.'s - 
tic features we explored and the alternatives tor 
each of them. In Section 5 we give the results of 
our evaluation on different combinations of fea- 
tures and we analyze their significance. We also 
~rresent these results in a predictor-response 
amework, and we conclude by discussing the ap- 
plicability of our results to other NLP problems. 
2. AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADJECT IVE  
GROUPING SYSTEM 
Our adjective grouping system \[Hatzi- 
vassilogiou and McKeown, 1993\] starts with a set 
of adjectives to be clustered into semantically re- 
lated groups. Ideally, we want highly related 
words such as synonyms, antonyms, and 
hyponyms to be the only ones placed in the same 
group. The system is given ~e number of groups 
to form as an input parameter 2, and has access to a 
text corpus. No semantic information about the 
adjectives is available to the system. The system 
operates by extracting pairs of modified nouns for 
each adjective, and, optionally, pairs of adjectives 
that we can expect o be semantically uurelated on 
linguistic grounds 3. From the estimated istribu- 
tion of modified nouns for each adjective, a 
similarity sccxe is assigned to each possible pair of 
adjectives. This is based on KendaLl's x, a non- 
parametric, robust estimator of correlation 
\[Kendall, 193811 Using the similarity scores and, 
optionally, the established relationships of non- 
relatedness, a non-hierarchical clustermg method 
\[Spath, 1985\] assigns the adjectives to groups in a 
way that maximizes the within-group similarity 
(and therefore also maximizes the between-group 
dissimilarity). 
IWe thank Johanna Moore for pointing out this application 
to us. 
2Determining this number from the data is probably the 
hardest problem in cluster analysis in general; see \[Kaufman 
and Rousseeuw. 1990\]. 
J~hese are adjectives that either modify the same noun in 
the same NP (e.g. big white house) or one of them modifies 
the other (e.g. light blue coat); see \[Hatzivassiloglou and 
McKeown. 1993\] for a detailed analysis.

Figure 1: Example clustering found by the 
system using all linguistic modules. 
To evaluate our system, we have developed 
extended versions of the standard information 
retrieval measures precision, recell, and fallout. 
These extended versions score the grouping 
produced .by the system against a set of model 
groupings (mstead of just one) for the same adjec- 
fives, supplied by humans. In the experiments 
reported m this paper, we employ 8 or 9 human- 
constructed models for each adjective set. We 
base our comparisons on and report he F-measure 
scores \[Van Rijsbergen, 1979\] which combine 
precision and recall in a single number. In ad- 
dition, since the  correct number of groupings is 
something that the system cannot yet determine 
(and, incidentally, something that human 
evaluators disagree abou0, we run the system for 
the five ceases m the range -2 to +2 around the 
average number of clusters employed by the 
humans and average the results. This smoothing 
operation prevents an accidental hilgh or low score 
being reported when a small variauon in the num- 
ber of clusters produces very different scores. 
It should be noted here that the scores reported 
should not be interpreted as linear percentages. In 
other words, a score of 40 is not just twice as good 
as a score of 20, and going from 30 to 40 is much 
harder than goin$ from 20to 30. The latter is true 
for most applicanons, but the problem of interpret- 
ing the scores is exacerbated in our context be- 
cause of the structural constraints imposed by the 
clustering and the presence of multiple models. 
Furthermore, ven the best clustering that could be 
produced would not receive a score of 100, be- 
cause of disagreement among humans on what is 
the correct answer. To e l ,~  the meaning of the 
scores, we accompany them with lower and _upper 
bounds for each adjective set we examine. These 
bounds are obtained by the performance of a sys- 
tem that creates random groupings (averaged over 
many runs) and by the average score of the 
human-produced partitions when evaluated against 
the other human models respectively. 
Figure 1 shows an example clustering 
produced by our system for one of the adjective 
sets analyzed in this paper. 
3. THE L INGUIST IC  FEATURES BEING 
TESTED 
We have identified several sources of linguis- 
tic knowledge that can be incorporated in our sys- 
tem, augmenting the statistical component. Each 
such source represents a parameter of the system, 
i.e. a Ieature that can be present or absent or more 
generally take a value from a predefined set. We 
selected features that can be effficienfly computed 
in a completely automatic way for unrestricted text 
and do not require extensive amounts of 
knowledge to be available to the system. Almost 
all of these features can be ~generalized to other ap- 
plications as well, as we discuss in Section 6. In 
this section we discuss first one of these 
parameters that can take several values, namely 
the method of extracting data from the corpus, and 
then several other bina~-valued features. 
45 
3.1 Extracting data from the corpus 
Our adjective clustering system determines the 
distribution of related (modified) nouns for each 
adjective and eventuaUy the similarity between ad- 
jectives from pairs of the form (adjective. 
modified noun)observed in the corpus. Direct in- 
formation about incompatible adjectives (in the 
form of appropriate adjective-adjective pairs) cart 
~lso be collected from the corpus. Therefore, a 
tWst parameter of the st, stem and a possible dimen- 
sion for comparisons t the method employed to 
identify such pairs in free text. This is hardly a 
unigue feature of our system: all word-based 
statistical systems must fwst collect data from the 
corpus about the words of interest, on which the 
subsequent statistics operate 4 . 
There are several alternate models for this task 
of data collection, with different degees of lin- 
guistic sophistication. A first model Is to use no 
linguistic knowledge at all: we collect for each ad- 
jective of interest all words that fall within a win- 
dow of some predetermined size. Naturally. no 
negative data (adjective-adjective pairs) can be 
collected with this method. However, the method 
can be implemented easily and does not require 
the identification of any linguistic onstraints so it 
is completely general. It has been used for diverse 
problems uch as machine translation and sense 
disambiguation \[Gale t al., 1992, Schiltze, 1992\]. 
A second model is to restrict he words col- 
lected to the same sentence as the adjective of in- 
terest and to word elass(es) that we expect on lin- 
guistic grounds to be relevant o adjectives. For 
our application, we collect all nouns in the vicinity 
of an adjective without leaving the current sen- 
tence. We assume that these nouns have some 
relationship with the adjective and that seman- 
tically different adjectives will exhibit different 
collections of such nouns. This model requires 
only part-of-speech information (to identify 
nouns) and a method of detecting sentence boun- 
daries. It uses a window of fixed length to define 
the neighborhood f each adjective. Such a model 
incorporates minimal linguistic knowledge. 
namely in determining what constitutes the infor- 
mative class(es) of words collected (nouns in our 
problem). Again, negative knowledge such as in- 
compatible adjective pairs cannot be collected 
with this model. Nevertheless, it has also been 
widely used, e.g. for collocation extraction 
\[Sm~ja, 1993\] and sense disambiguation \[Liddy 
and Park, 1992\]. 
A third model uses a simple linguistic rule to 
identify pairs of interest that is even more restric- 
tive and informative than the "nouns in vicinity" 
4Although frequently details of the statistical model 
employed receive more consideration. 
approach. Since we are interested in .nouns 
modified by adjectives, uch a rule is to correct a 
noun immediately following an adjective, assum- 
ing that this implies a modification relationship. 
Pairs of consecutive adjectives Can also be col- 
lected. 
Up to this point we have successively 
restricted the collected pairs on linguistic grounds, 
so that less but cleaner data is collected. For the 
fourth model, we extend the simple rule given 
above, using linguistic information to catch more 
valid pairs without sacrificing accuracy. We 
employ a pattern matcher that retrieves any se- 
quence of one or more adjectives followed by any 
sequence of zero or more nouns. These sequences 
are then analyzed with heuristics based on linguis- 
tics to obtain pairs. For example, it can be shown 
that all adjectives in such a sequence must be 
semantically unrelated, and that it is best to attach 
all the adjectives to the final noun. 
The regular expression and pattern matching 
rules of the previous model can be extended fur- 
ther, forming a grammar for the constructs of in- 
terest. This approach can detect more pairs, and at 
the same time address known problematic cases 
not detected by the previous models. 
We imp.lemented the above five data extraction 
models, using typical window sizes for the first 
two methods (50 and 5 on each side of the window 
respectively) which have been found useful in 
other problems before. For the fifth model, we 
developed a finite-state grammar for NPs which is 
able to handle both predicative and attributive 
modification of nouns, conjunctions of adjectives, 
adverbial modification of adjectives, quantifiers, 
and apposition of adjectives to nouns or other 
adjectives 5. Unfortunately, the resources required 
to perform our tests for the first model were too 
great (e.g. 12,287,320 pairs in a 151 MB file were 
extracted for the 21 adjectives in our smallest test 
set) so we dropped that model from further con- 
sideration and we use the second model as the 
baseline of minimal inguistic knowledge. Other 
researchers have also reported similar problems of 
excessive resource demands with the "collect all 
neighbors" model \[Gale t al., 1992\]. 
3.2 Other l inguistic features 
In addition to the data extraction method, we 
identified three other areas where linguistic 
knowledge can be introduced in our system. F'trst, 
we can employ morphology to convert plural

nouns to the corresponding singular ones and ad- 
jectives in comparative or superlative degree to 
their base form. Almost all adjectives and nouns 
that appear in multiple forms have no semantic 
difference from their base form except for the 
number or deg'e  feature. This conversion com- 
bines counts of similar pairs, thus raising the ex- 
pected and estimated fr~,quencies of each pair in 
any statistical model. We develoI.~zl a m0rphol- 
ogy component that produces the singular fohn of 
nouns nsmg rules pins a large table of exceptions. 
For adjectives, a set of rules is _again employed but 
because of the vowed in the suffix -er or -est, many 
base forms look plausible without a lexicon (e.g. 
bigger could have been produced from big, bi~g, 
or bigge). We solve this problem ~ counting me 
occurrences of each candidate form in our corpus 
and selecting the one with non-zero frequency. 
Another potential application of linguistic 
knowledge is the use o f  it spell-checking proce- 
dure, combined with a word list, to eliminate 
typographical errors from the corpus. Such en'ors 
can produce wrong estimates for the frequencies 
of modified nouns for an adjective, but most im- 
portant!y introduce "unique" nouns appea~'ing 
only with one adjective, skewing the comparison 
of noun distributions. We implemented this com- 
ponent using the Unix spell program and as- 
sociated word list, with extensions for hyphenated 
compounds. Uni~ortm~tedy, since a fixed and 
domgiu independent lemcon is used for this 
process, some valid but overspecialized words 
may be discarded too. 
Finally, we can use additional sources of 
knowledge which supplement the primary 
similarity relationships and are justified on linguis- 
tic grounds. We identified several potential 
sources of additional knowledge that can be ex- 
tracted from the corpus (e.g. conjunctions of ad- 
jectives). In this comparison study we im- 
plemented and consider the significance of one of 
these knowledge sources, r~medy the negative x- 
amples offered by adjective-adjective pairs. 
46 
4. THE COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS 
In the previous section we identified four 
parameters of the system, the effects of which we 
want to analyze. But in addition to these 
parameters that can be directly varied and have 
predetermined possible values, several other vari- 
ables can affect he performance of the system. 
First, the performance of the system depends 
naturally on the adjective set that is to be clus- 
tered. Presumably variations in the adjective set 
can be modeled by several parameters, uch as 
size of the set, number of semantic groups in it, 
and strength of semantic relatedness among its 
members, plus several parameters describing the 
properties of the adjectives in the set in isolation, 
such as frequency, specificity, etc. 
A second variable that affects the clustering is 
the corpus that is used as the main knowledge 
source, through the observed cooeeurrence pat- 
terns. Again the effects of different corpora can be 
separatecl into several factors, e.g. the size of the 
corpus, its generality, the genre of  the texts, etc. 
Since in this paper we are interested in quan- 
tifying the effect of the linguistic knowlcdse in our 
system, or more precisely of the linguistic 
knowledge that we can explicitly control through 
the four parameters discussed above, we did not 
attempt o model in detail the various factors

.~ective set and corpus. However, we are interested 
in measuring the effects of the linguistic 
parameters in a wide range of contexts, and m cor- 
relating these effects with variables originating 
from the choice of corpus and adjective set. For 
example, we would want to be able to detect hat 
the linguistic parameter "morphology" is sig- 
nificant for small corpora but not for large ones, if 
that were the cease. Therefore, we included in our 
model two additional parameters, representing the 
corpus and the adjective set used. 
We used the Wall Street Journal articles from 
the ACL-DCI as our corpus. We selected four sub- 
corpora of decreasing size to study the relationship 
of corpus size with linguistic feature effects: all 
the 1987 articles (21 million words), every third of 
these articles (7 million words), every twenty-first 
(1 million words), and articles no. 50 and 100 
(330,000 words). Since we use subsets of the same 
corpus, we are essentially modeling the corpus 
size parameter only.

Table 1: Average scores when only one feature 
is changed. 
For each corpus, we analyzed three different 
sets of adjectives, listed in figures 2-4. The first of  
them was selected from a similar corpus, contains 
21 frequent and ambiguous words that all as- 
sociate strongly with a particular noun (problem), 
and was analyzed in \[Hatzivassiloglou and 
McKeown, 1993\]. The second set (43 adjectives) 
was saected with the constraint that it contain 
high frequency adjectives (more than 1,000 occur- 
rences in the 21 million word corpus). The third 
set (62 adjec.fives) satisfies the opposite constraint 
containing adjectives of relatively low frequency 
(between 50 and 250). Figure 1 shows a typical 
 uping found by our system for the third set of a jectives, when the full corpus and all linguistic 
modules were used. 
These three sets of adjectives represent various 
characteristics of the adjective sets that the system 
may be c,~led to. duster. First, they explicitly 
represent increasing sizes of the grouping 
problem. The second and third sets also contrast 
the independent frequencies of their member ad- 
JfreCtives. Furthermore, we have found that the less 
equent adjectives of the third set tend to be more 
specific than the more frequent ones. The human 
evaluators reported that the task of classification 
was easier for the third set, and their models ex- 
hibited about he same degree of agreement for the 
second and third sets although the third set is sig- 
nificantly larger. We plan to investigate the 
generality of this inverse correlation between fre- 
quency and specificity in the future. 
By including the parameters "corpus size" 
and "adjective set", we have six parameters that 
we can vary in our experiments. Any remaining 
tactors affecting the performance of our system 
are modeled as random noise, so staUstical 
methods are used to evaluate the effects of the 
selected parameters. The six chosen parameters 
48 
are completely orthogonal, with the exception that 
parameter "negative knowledge" must have the 
value "not used" when parameter "extraction 
model" has the value "nouns in vicinity". In or- 
der to avoid introducing imbalance in our experi- 
ment, we constructed a complete designed experi- 
merit \[Hicks, 1973\] for all their (4x2- l )x2x2x  
4 x 3 = 336 valid combinations 6. 
5. RESULTS 
5.1 Average effect of each linguistic 
parameter  
Space limitations do not allow us to present the 
scores for every one of the 336 individual experi- 
ments performed, corresponding to all valid com- 
binations of the six modeled parameters. Instead 
we present several summary measures. We 
measured the effect of eachparticular setting of 
each linguistic parameter of Section 3 by averag- 
ing the scores obtained in all experiments where 
mat particular parameter had thatparticular value. 
In this way, Table 1 summarizes the differences in 
the performance of the system caused by each 
parameter. Because of the complete design of the 
experiment, each value in Table 1 is obtained in 
runs that are identical to the runs used for estimat- 
ing the other values of the same parameter xcept 
for the difference in the parameter itself 7. 
Table I shows that there is indeed improve- 
.ment with the introduction of any of the proposed 
linguistic teatures, or with the use of a lingnis- 
ticfilly more sophisticated xtraction model. To as- 
sess the statistical significance of these dif- 
ferences, we compared each run for a particular 
value of a parameter tothe corresponding identical 
valueo '(exc ptflOr that parameter) run for a different 
u me parameter. Each pair of values for a 
paran~eter p oduces~ in this way a set of paired ob- 
servations, on eacn of these sets, we performed a 
sign test \[Gibbons and Chakrahorti, 1992\] of the 
null hypoth~is that there is no real difference in 
the system s performance between the two values, 
i.e. that any observed ifference is due to chance. 
We counted the number of times that the first of 
the two compared values led to superior perfor- 
mance relative to the second, distributing ties 
equally between the two cases. Under the null 
hypothesis, the number of times that the first value

tion of the modeled predictors. 
7The slight asymmetry in parameters "extraction model" 
and "negative knowledge" is accounted for by leaving out 
non-matching runs.

5.2 Comparison among the linguistic 
features 
In order to measure the significance of the con- 
tribufion of each linguistic feature relative to the 
other linguistic features, we fitted a linear regres- 
sion model \[Draper and Smith, 1981\] to the data. 
We use the six parameters of our experiments as 
the predictors, and the measured F-score of the 
corresponding clustering as the response variable. 
In such a model the response Y is assumed to be a 
linear function of the predictors, i.e. 
Y=bo+bl.Xl+b2.X2+... +bn'X n (1) 
where X i is the i-th predictor and bi is its ccor- 
responding weight s . The weights found by the fit- 
ring process (Table 3) indicate by their absolute 
magriitude and sign how important each predictor 
is and whether it contributes positively or nega- 
tively to the final result. Numerical values such as 
SSueh a model is appropriate for comparative purposes, 
although extrapolating response values for prediction outside 
the range of predictor values used in the fitting may give 
incorrect results. For example, the coefficients in Table 3 
earmot be used to predict the score when the corpus is fig- 
niticanfly smaller than 0.33 Mbytes or larger than 21 Mbytes. 
the corpus size enter formula (1) directly as 
predictors, so Table 3 indicates that each ad- 
ditional megabyte of text increases the perfor- 
mance of the system by 0.9417 on the average. 
For binary features, the weights in Table 3 indicate 
the increase in the system's performance when the 
feature is present, so introduction of morphology

from adjecuve set 2 to adjective set 3 decreases 
the score by -(-2.5996-11.4882) = 14.0878 on the

 erformance of a minimal system that uses the ase case for each pararneter; the effects of corpus 
size are to be added to this system. 
From Table 3 we can see that the data extrac- 
tion model has a significant effect on the quality of 
the produced clustering, and among the fingutstic 
parameters i the most important one. Increasing 
the size of the corpus also significantly increases 
the score. The adjective set that is clustered also 
has a major influence on the score, with rarer ad- 
jectives leading to worse clusterings. The two lin- 
guistic feat~u~e s "morphology" and "negative 
knowledge' have less pronounced although still 
sil~nificant effects, while spell-cbecking offers 
minimal improvement that probably does not jus- 
tify the effort of implementing the module and the 
cost of activating it at run-time. 
5.3 Overall effect of linguistic knowledge 
Up to this point we have described averages of 
scores, taken over many combinations of features 
that are orthogonal to the one studied. These 
averages are good for describing the existence of a 
difference caused by the different values of each 
feature, across all possible combinations of the 
other features. They are not, however, repre- 
sentative of the performance of the system m a 
particular setting of parameters, nor are they 
suitable for describing the difference in features 
quantitatively, since they are averages taken over 
widely differing settings of the system's 
parameters. In particular, the inclusion of very 
small corpora drives the average scores down, as 
we have confirmed in a more detailed analysis 
where averages were computed separately for each 
value of the corpus size parameter. To gtve a feel- 
ing of how important the introduction of linguistic 
knowledge is quantitatively, we compare in Table 
4 the results obtained for the full corpus of 21 mil- 
lion words for the two cases of having all or none 
of the linguistic omponents active. The scores ob- 
tained by a random system that produces partitions 
50 
of the adjectives with no knowledge xcept the 
number of groups are included as a lower bound. 
These estimates are obtained after averaging the 
scores of 20,000 such random partitions for each 
adjective set. The average scores that each human 
model receives when compared to all the other 
human models are also included, since they 
ovide an estimate of the maximum score that can 
achieved by any system. That maximum 
depends on the disagreement between models for 
each adjective set. For these measurements weuse 
a smaller smoothing window of size 3 instead of 5, 
which is fairer to the system when its performance 
is compared to the humans. We also give in Figure 
5 the grouping produced by the system witlaout 
using any of the linguistic modules for adjective 
set 3; this is to be contrasted with Figure I. 
6. GENERAL IZ ING TO OTHER 
APPL ICAT IONS 
In the previous ection, we showed that the in- 
troduction of linguistic knowledge in our system 
produces a performance difference, which is not 
only statistically observable but also quantitatively 
significant (cf. Table 4). We believe that these 
positive results should also apply to other corpus- 
based NLP systems that employ statistical 
methods. Many of the linguistic components of 
our system, including the extraction model that 
was shown to be the most important linguistic 
parameter, are not specific to the word grouping 
problem. They can thus be directly incorporated in
systems designed for other problems but essen- 
tially following the same basic architecture as 
ours. 
Many statistical approaches hare the same 
basic methodology with our system: a set of words 
is preselected, related words are identified in a 
corpus, the frequencies of words and of pairs o f  
related words are estimated, and a statistical model 
is used to make predictions for the original words. 
Across appfications, there are differences in what 
words are selected, how related words are defined, 
and what kind of predictions i  made. Neverthe- 
less, the basic components stay the same. For ex- 
ample, in our appfication the original words are 
1. catastrophic harmful 
2. dry wet 
3. lenient rigid strict stringent 
4. communist leftist 
5. flexible hostile protracted unfriendly 
6. abrupt chaotic disastrous gradual 
turbulent vigorous 
7. affluent affordable inexpensive 
prosperous 
8. outrageous 
9. capitalist socialist 
lO. dismal gloomy pleasant 
11. generous insufficient meager scant 
slim 
12. delicate fragile 
13. brilliant energetic 
14. dual multiple stupid 
15. hazardous toxic unreasonable 
unstable 
16. plain 
17. confusing 
18. clever 
19. endless 
20. clean dirty impoverished 
21. deadly fatal 
22. astonishing misleading stunning 
? 23. dumb fat smart 
24. exotic

system using no linguistic modules. 
the adjectives and the predictions are their groups: 
in machine translation, the predictions are the 
translations of the words in the source languag~ 
text; in sense disambiguation, the predictions are 
the senses assigned to the words of interest; in 
part-of-speech tagging or in classification the 
predictions are the t,~s or classes assigned to each 
word. Because of this underlying similarity, the 
comparative analysis presented m the paper is 
relevant to all these problems. 
For a concrete xample, we examine the case 
of collocation extraction that has been addressed 
with statistical methods in the past. Smadja 
\[1993\] describes a system that imtially uses the 
"nouns in vicinity" extraction model to collect 
cooccurrence information about words, and then 
identifies collocations on the basis of distributional 
criteria. A later component falters the retrieved col- 
locations, removing the ones where the participat- 
ing words are not used consistently in the same 
syntactic relationship. This post-processing stage 
doubles the precision of the system. We believe 
that using from the start a more sophisticated ex- 
traction model to collect these pairs of related 
words will have similar positive effects. Other lin- 
guistic components, such as a morphology module 
that combines frequency counts, should also im- 
prove the performance of the system, In this way, 
we can benefit from linguistic knowledge without 
having to use a separate filtering process after ex- 
pending the effort o coUeet he collocations. 
Similarly, the sense disambiguation problem is 
typically attacked by comparing the distribution of 
the neighbors of a word's occurrence toprototypi- 
cal distributions associated with each of the 
word's senses \[Gale et al, 1992, Schtltze, 1992\]. 
Usually, no explicit linguistic knowledge is used 
in defining these neighbors, which are taken as all 
words appearing within a window of fixed width 
centered-at the word being disambiguated. Many 
words unrelated to the word of interest are col- 
lected in this way. In contrast, identifying ap- 
propriate word classes that can be expected on lin- 
guistic grounds to convey significant information 
about he original word should increase the perfor- 
mance of the disambiguation system. Such classes 
might be modified nouns for adjectives, nouns in a 
subject or object position for verbs, etc. As we 
have showed in Section 5, less but cleaner infor- 
mation increases the quality of the results. 
An interesting topic is the identification of 
parallels of our fingulstic modules for these ap- 
plications, at least for those modules which, unlike 
morphology, are not ubiquitous. Negative 
knowledge for example improves the performance 
of our system, supplementing the positive infor- 
mation provided by adjective-noun pairs. It could 
be useful for other systems as well if an ap- 
propriate application-dependent me hod of extract- 
mg such information is identified.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
We have showed that all lin$uistic features 
considered in this study had a posiuve contribution 
to the performance of the system. Except for ~spell- 
checking, all these contributions were both statis- 
tically significant and large enough to make a dif- 
ferencce in practical situations. Furthermore, the 
results can be expected to generalize to a wide 
variety of corpus-based systems for different ap- 
plications. 
The cost of incorporating the linguistics-based 
modules in the system is not prohibitive. The ef- 
fort needed to implement all the linguistic modules 
was about 5 person-months, in contrast with 7 
person-months needed to develop the basic statis- 
tical system. Furthermore, the run-time overhead 
causedby the linguistic modules is not significant. 
Each takes from l to  7 minutes on a Sun SparcSta- 
tion 10 to process a million entries (words or 
pairs) and all except the negative knowledge 
module need process a corpus only once, reusing 
the same information for different adjective sets. 
This should be compared to the approximately 15 
minutes needed by the statistical component for 
grouping about 40 adjectives. 
In the future, we plan to extend the results dis- 
cussed in this paper by an analysis of the depen- 
dence of the effects of each parameter on the 
values of the other parameters. We are currently 
stratifying the experimental data obtained to study 
trends in the magnitude of parameter effects as 
other parameters vary in a controlled manner, and 
we will examine the interactions with corpus size 
and specificity of clustered adjectives. We are 
also interested in providing similar quantitative 
results for other applications, to corroborate our 
belief in the generality of the importance of easily 
obtainable linguistic knowledge for statistical sys- 
tems.
