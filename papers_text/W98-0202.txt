We are developing an Intelligent Network News 
Reader which extracts news articles for users. In 
contrast o ordinary information retrieval and ab- 
stract generation, this method utilizes an "informa- 
tion context" to select articles from newsgroups on 
the Internet and it displays the context visually. A 
salient feature of this system is that it retrieves ar- 
ticles dynamically, adapting itself to the user's in- 
terests, not classifying them beforehand. Since this 
system measures the semantic distance between arti- 
cles, it is possible to refer to the necessary informa- 
tion without being constrained within a particular 
news group. We finished a prototype of the Intelli- 
gent Network News Reader in March 1998 and will 
complete a final practical version in March 2000. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Extracting necessary information easily from the 
bulk of information available throughout the world 
is crucial for people living in this highly computer- 
ized society, and therefore, it is necessary to develop 
systems which can visually present he selected in- 
formation ecessary to assist people in forming new 
concepts. A great deal of work on this subject has 
been done by various researchers, e.g., information 
retrieval from newspaper articles and message un- 
derstanding in newspaper articles. 
It is not sufficient hat this kind of expert system 
simply imitate the real world. Such systems have to 
create a richer environment with the visual interface 
than there is now. This means not simply supplying 
an imitation of the real world, but actively building 
a virtual world where the density of information is 
higher than that of the real world for a given use. In 
other words, we need information screening for each 
individual user. Therefore, technology which selects 
and presents the necessary information will be the 
key to information retrieval in the future. 
As an application of this kind of technology to 
the Internet, we are developing an Intelligent Net- 
work News Reader (HISHO: Helpful Information Se- 
12 
lection by Hunting On-line) which extracts news ar- 
ticles for users and which visually displays the struc- 
ture of articles. In contrast o ordinary information 
retrieval and abstract generation, this method uti- 
lizes an "information context" to select articles from 
newsgroups on the Internet. We finished our pro- 
totype of the Intelligent Network News Reader in 
March 1998 and will complete a final practical ver- 
sion in March 2000. 
In this paper, we discuss how to find topic chang- 
ing articles in the tree structures of news articles, 
how to extract topic differences from the thread of 
articles, and how to indicate this information in the 
display to help users decide which part of the tree 
structures of articles they will read. 
2 In fo rmat ion  Gather ing  f rom the  
Network  News  
Network news has recently become very popular 
worldwide, and the number of articles generated ev- 
ery day is increasing rapidly. Also the quality of in- 
formation in these articles varies widely. This makes 
the percentage of important information lower and 
lower. 
Many people use or want to use Internet news. 
However, since it is not possible to read all the arti- 
cles received, it is difficult to find articles on a spe- 
cific topic and it is difficult to determine from these 
articles, which are relevant to one's pecific interests, 
especially where the author of the article neglected 
to use a suitable subject, i.e., title. This situation, 
i.e., articles without suitable subjects, often occurs 
and thus, it is not easy to retrieve information uti- 
lizing a simple keyword-based method. 
Some research on such problems, i.e., on gather- 
ing information efficiently, has been done, but most 
of the research as been limited to generating ab- 
stracts or extracting some topics. However, they are 
immature and still have many problems. No one, 
yet, has established a way for the user to tell a news 
reader what he/she requires. 
3 In fo rmat ion  Ret r ieva l  and  News  
Reader  
There is much on-going research in information re- 
trieval. In document retrieval, the key technology 
is the utilization of keywords, titles, and user de- 
fined "key words" (Jacobs, 1992). Full text search is 
now very fast using some programming techniques. 
TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) by ARPA in- 
cludes this kind of approach (Harman, 1994). 
One of the targets of the summarization and in- 
formation extraction domains is to plug information 
into some templates. MUC (Message Understanding 
Conference) by ARPA is in~colved in doing this kind 
of work (ARPA, 1993). 
However, these approaches are not suitable for in- 
formation retrieval from the network news on the 
Internet. Therefore, there have been many propos- 
als for network news readers. For example, "Galaxy 
of News" retrieves ets of information related to one 
another by adopting a stochastic method to produce 
a hierarchy of keywords and it presents the results of 
the search visually, i.e., 3-dimensionally (Rennison, 
1994). However, users have to manually chose the 
articles they want to read. 
Another program which assists users in selecting 
articles they should read is the "Personalized Elec- 
tronic News Editor" (Sheth, 1994). First, a user 
instructs the agents who are in charge of informa- 
tion retrieval of his/her preferences. Then, they ex- 
tract keywords, chose articles using the extracted 
keyword, and recommend the chosen articles to the 
user. There is also research being done on the sum- 
marization of news articles to help people who read 
the network news (Sato, 1994). Although this is a 
very useful research domain, when we think of the 
actual user needs for a network news reader, these 
needs are not being met. Users generally want to 
read the whole article relevant o their interests, and 
they are not satisfied reading abstracts. Therefore, 
it is necessary to display not only the summary con- 
ceived in terms but the whole relevant section of the 
original articles. 
Also, we have to be aware of the following point. 
There are two types of network news. The first is 
newswire-like newsgroups, which are similar to the 
ordinary newspaper and which makes various an- 
nouncements, uch as meetings, job opportunities, 
and so on. Of course, these newsgroups are very 
informative, but they do not contain such a large 
number of articles. The second is newsgroups for 
discussion among users. This is where people dis- 
cuss things, the topic for which has been introduced 
by one of them. Each article in the newswire-like 
newsgroups i mainly self-contained, therefore, it is 
13 
possible to retrieve previous articles dealing with the 
same subject by using simple keyword-based tech- 
nology. 
However, articles in the newsgroups for discus- 
sion are neither semantically nor referentially self- 
contained. The previously mentioned "Personalized 
Electronic News Editor" and summarization systems 
are for articles in the newswire-like newsgroups. Our 
system focuses on assisting the reader of the discus- 
sion newsgroups by intelligently screening articles in 
the network news. 
4 Features  o f  Network  News  
Network news is a good knowledge source and the 
expectation is that the articles are well organized. 
The assumption is that related articles should have 
the same title or be linked together by informa- 
tion in a reference field and that non-related arti- 
cles should have different itles. However, often this 
is not true. Recent news reader systems which uti- 
lize this kind of information to classify news arti- 
cles have been misleading. We checked two news- 
groups, specifically, fj.life.health and fj.sci.medical. 
In fj.life.health, we found 525 disjointed parts in 
1431 articles over 13 months using their reference 
fields, and in fj.sci.medical, we found 692 disjointed 
parts in 1683 articles. For example, in fj.life.health, 
209 articles had no relation to other articles explic- 
itly, however, 61 of these had some relation to the 
others when we checked their content. Also, some 
parts which involved more than one article were se- 
mantically related to the other parts. This indicates 
that if we use the reference field to find relations be- 
tween articles, many of these would not be extracted. 
The subject field of each article seems informa- 
tive, however, news writers do not tend to change 
the subject even if they change the topic of their 
articles from the former one. We found during our 
experiment that the subject is not very informative 
and it is not efficient if a news reader presents all 
articles with the same subject to users. 
Therefore, it is necessary for the Intelligent Net- 
work News Reader to have a way of gathering all the 
relations between articles based on their content. We 
propose a system which sees the articles in network 
news as a kind of conversational text, which goes up- 
stream in the flow of topics for articles, considering 
references, quotations and the relative importance 
between words and/or sentences, and which extracts 
and visually displays articles which have user rele- 
vant information. 
5 In te l l igent  Network  News Reader  
We are developing an Intelligent Network News 
Reader as part of the environment in assisting the 
growth of human intellectual creativity, focusing on 
screening technology to raise the density of informa- 
tion. We see this as one application of natural an- 
guage processing technology as we progress toward 
a mult imedia network society (Nikkei, 1995). 
In this paper, we clarify problems which prevent 
the effective use of information on the network news, 
and we propose a way of extracting the necessary 
information by focusing on the consistency of topics 
in the articles. We also propose a way of displaying 
the extracted information visually to assist users in 
reading informative news articles effectively. We also 
attempt o solve the problems. Our system has the 
following features: it treats the article in which the 
user is interested as a key to information retrieval, 
weighs the relative importance between sentences by 
using natural language processing technology, and 
it utilizes heuristics on the features of the network 
news assuming it to be a kind of conversational text. 
Typical usage of this system would be: the user is 
very busy and cannot keep up with the recent news, 
he/she gets some free time and takes a look at to- 
day's news articles which are extracted from a huge 
set of unread articles. He/she finds one very inter- 
esting article and wants to read all the articles per- 
taining to that topic, enough to understand whole 
discussion. So, what should the news reader do to 
help him/her? 
A news reader for busy people needs not only 
make an abstract of the recent news - since the ab- 
straction process can drop some important informa- 
tion - but to choose the suitable thread to follow 
on the basis of the content of the news articles. We 
therefore propose the concept of "information con- 
text" defined by the structural distribution of words 
in the articles. Using this context, the user can fol- 
low a suitable thread, even if some articles are lack- 
ing a suitable subject. 
To make a decision regarding article retrieval or 
summary generation, it is not enough to give such 
a system keywords or a title in the subject field of 
the news. Recently developed news readers classify 
news items using their subjects, however, since the 
subject often differs from the contents of the article, 
many unnecessary articles are extracted by such a 
simple screening method. 
A keyword method can be useful when one knows 
what information he/she wants, or when one pre- 
cisely knows the hierarchy of keywords, e.g., a the- 
saurus. When one is in the process of forming a new 
concept from his/her basic concept, it is not possible 
to chose a suitable keyword. The human conception 
process begins from the basic stage, passes into the 
thinking stage with the process of extracting related 
news, and clarifies its target and/or  its result. Our 
intelligent news reader is expected to improve the ef- 
ficiency of the retrieval of network news, and is also 
expected to be a tool for assisting some intelligent 
activities by humans. 
Here, the key to retrieval is not the keyword or 
titles which are decided by the users based on their 
own intuition, but the relevant article itself. In 
other words, this system allows information retrieval 
through the use of ambiguous keys. It is not neces- 
sary for the user to enter any concrete keywords or 
titles of articles. He/she simply needs to point to the 
article which he/she is interested in. The system will 
find (almost) all related articles. 
We are developing the system in JAVA language 
which is one of the most popular languages capable 
of handling visual images on the screen. 
The system works as follows: 
1. A user finds an article which fits his/her inter- 
ests. 
2. The HISHO system makes a reference tree (RT) 
and sets a family tree obeying the user's elected 
article. It checks the article's relation inside the 
FT.  
3. The system checks the relation between the FT 
and other RTs. 
4. The system displays the relevant articles which 
fit the user's interests by using a graphic inter- 
face. 
When the user activates the system, it automat- 
ically creates a tree structure of articles in a news 
spool by using their "References" field, then it re- 
fines these tree structures using the "Subject" field. 
We call these structures reference trees. 
The user begins to read articles and finds a news 
article which fits his interests. The selected article 
is called the focus article (FA). An RT including the 
FA is called a family tree. 
When the user selects the FA, HISHO starts to 
find the FT and extract features of the FA. Some- 
times an RT has a lot of articles. In that case, it 
is possible that the RT includes several topics. So, 
HISHO identifies a topic-changing article in the FT. 
The feature of the FT  is calculated by using the 
score of terms in articles of the FT. The terms in the 
FA add the special score. The system calculates fea- 
tures of the RTs including the FT  and gathers imi- 
lar RTs. Related articles are extracted using the fea- 
ture value from articles not connected by "Subject" 
14  
and/or "References" field. It means that HISI-IO can 
gather similar RTs even if those belong to different 
news groups from the original news group. 
HISHO gathers the articles which are related to 
the article selected by a user. After calculating the 
relevance that is checking the topics, HISHO catego- 
rizes some articles in time order, and gives the user 
the end result by using a graphic interface. 
The salient feature of this system is that it re- 
trieves articles dynamically, that is adapting to the 
user's interests, without classifying them before- 
hand. Since this system measures the semantic 
distance between articles, it is possible to refer to 
the necessary information without being constrained 
within a particular newsgroup. 
6 V isua l i zat ion  of Articles 
Our aim is to allow users to clearly grasp the stream 
of discussion in discussion-type newsgroups when 
they are shown articles by our system. The sum- 
marization of articles is an efficient means of outlin- 
ing a discussion. However, it is hard to convey the 
stream of discussion by using only summarization. 
We are developing a systemn that can help users to 
read smoothly by showing them structuralized arti- 
cles instead of summaries. 
We can divide streams of discussion into three 
kinds of groups by paying attention to the transition 
of topics. The first is a stream where the topic does 
not shift from first to last, the second is a stream 
where the topic shifts halfway, and the third is a 
stream where several topics are discussed in a certain 
article and then each topic is discussed respectively. 
Further, the attitudes of contributors, e.g., proposal, 
approval, opposition, supplements and so on, are re- 
flected in each stream. In this paper, we discuss a 
method of presenting articles so that it is easy for 
users to grasp the stream of discussion, and we defer 
dealing with the individual attitudes of contributors 
of the articles towards the discussion. 
We assume the following structure which is easy 
for users to understand: 
? Parts where the topic shifts or branches are 
tagged. 
? The difference between topics is represented by 
keywords. 
If we structure articles in this manner, users can 
catch the changing topic points and the topic 
branching points and they can easily grasp the dif- 
ference between topics, enabling them to have a clear 
grasp of the stream of discussion. A distinctive fea- 
ture of our method is that when users read a cer- 
tain article, they can grasp the outline of the articles 
which follow. 
So far, several methods of visualizing archives by 
using keywords have been proposed. These methods 
were applied to discussion-type newsgroups and the 
WWW (Yabe et al, 1997; Arita et al, 1995). In 
these, articles where the same topic is discussed are 
located nearer than those where a different opic is 
discussed, and the topics are visualized by represent- 
ing keywords. Those methods have an advantage in 
that users can easily grasp what kinds of topics are 
being discussed as a whole and which articles those 
topics are discussed in. However, these methods do 
not deal with the stream of discussion. Our proto- 
type system can extract the stream of discussion as 
an RT (Isahara et al, 1997), and it can indicate the 
article region where the same topic is discussed by 
identifying the changing topic. That is to say, when 
a user is interested in a certain article, the system 
can designate the article region that he should read 
next. Furthermore, in our method, topic branching 
can automatically be identified, and the difference 
between topics discussed in articles can be repre- 
sented by using keywords, so that articles can be 
shown to users as those being easy to understand. 
6.1 S t ruc tura l i za t ion  of  Art ic les 
Figure 1 shows a conceptual image of the structural- 
ized articles. The tree represents a series of discus- 
sions. By using the "References" information each 
article has, we can easily relate the articles in the 
tree structure. The tags, "TCA" and "TBA", in- 
dicate that the topic changes and branches respec- 
tively from each tagged article. Our method can 
correctly identify changing topics and topic branch- 
ing through evaluating the difference in keywords 
between articles. The keywords confirming identifi- 
cation are those that represent the difference in top- 
ics. Therefore, we extract these keywords and dis- 
play them as Figure 1 shows. In the articles within 
the ellipse, the same topic is discussed. 
In the following section, we first define topic- 
changing and topic-branching articles, and in Sec- 
tions 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 we describe the basic idea of 
our methods in identifying these articles. 
6.1.1 Top ic -chang ing  Art ic les and  
Top ic -branch lng  Art ic les 
Users in discussion-type newsgroups have discus- 
sions with each other in the form of articles. Each 
article contributed to network newsgroups has "Ref- 
erences" information, which is a list of related arti- 
cles and is much like a list of cross-references. By 
using this information, we can easily relate the arti- 
cles in a tree structure (reference tree). 
15 
x,Z / Q:Article 
Figure 1: Conceptual Image of Structuralized Arti- 
cles. 
In this tree, a subordinate article is a reply to or 
comment on the more highly ranked article. The 
tree branches off at articles which are replied to or 
commented on by several contributors. 
The greater the length of the path and the more 
branches the tree has, the higher the probability of 
topic-changing and topic-branching. In this paper, 
we call an article in which the topic changes a topic- 
changing article and one in which the topic branches 
a topic-branching article. 
6.1.2 Method  of Ident i fy ing  a 
Top ic -changing Art ic le 
If the topic does not change, in a series of articles, 
a lot of the same words tend to be used in all the 
articles. If the topic changes, on the other hand, it is 
expected that words different from those in previous 
articles will be used after that turning point. Our 
system identifies topic-changing articles by looking 
for the transition in the frequency of words (Uchi- 
moto et al, 1997). 
We utilize the following distinctive features to 
identify topic-changing articles. 
Feature  1 At a topic-changing article, the ratio of 
keywords never seen in the previous articles to 
all keywords in the article is higher than the 
ratio in the previous article. 
Feature  2 When we split articles into two groups 
at a topic-changing article, keywords chosen in 
one group tend to appear frequently in that 
group, and less frequently in the other group. 
We extract keywords which conform to Feature 2 
from identified topic-changing articles, and utilize 
them as the keywords to present o users. 
It is impossible for our system to split a sentence 
into words correctly, since it does not use dictio- 
naries. So instead of using words, our system uses 
keywords. A keyword consists of strings of kanji, 
e.g., "1.~5~:1~30:~", or strings of kanji, katakana, letters, 
and/or numbers, e.g., "n P'3./-," or "4 :~ 1) T l ,~" .  
We assume that nouns represent features of an arti- 
cle better than verbs, adjectives, and so on do, and 
that most of the nouns in articles consist 0fstrings of 
kanji or strings of katakana, letters and/or numbers 
followed by hiragana. If we cut the strings of hira- 
gana from the text, what is left will be either nouns 
or arbitrary strings without hiragana. When that 
remainder consists of only one kanji character and 
is not followed by a cue word, e.g., a function word 
"l:t (ha)", "~ (ga)", "~ (wo)", "k  L'C (to-shite)", 
we eliminate it, because it will not be a noun but 
a verb stem or an adjective stem. We regard these 
hiragana-free strings as keywords. 
6.1.3 Method  of  Ident i fy ing  a 
Top lc -branch ing  Art ic le  
When several topics are discussed in a certain ar- 
ticle, as is often the case, each topic is discussed 
respectively at each branch extending from the ar- 
ticle. However, each topic is not always clearly dis- 
cussed at each branch, but several topics are often 
discussed at several branches. When this happens, 
the article region where the same topic is discussed 
overlaps the others as the left branch of Figure 1 
shows. Therefore, in the clustering of articles that 
branch from a certain article, the articles are allowed 
to belong to several clusters. Our method compares 
pairs of articles and classifies articles whose topic is 
the same into the same cluster. If several clusters are 
produced by clustering, our method presumes that 
the topics branch at that branching article. For ex- 
ample, we assume that five articles A1 - As branch 
from article A0 as Figure 2 shows. When our method 
compares pairs of articles and identifies the two ar- 
ticles indicated by the open circle (0 )  in the Table 
of Figure 2 as articles where the same topic is dis- 
cussed, the results of clustering can be presented as 
shown at the right of Figure 2.

Figure 2: Example of Clustering Articles 
We utilized the following distinctive features to 
determine whether the topic discussed in the arti- 
cles was the same or not. Two branches where the 
same topic is discussed tend to quote the identical 
16  
parts from the branching original article (Feature 
3) and to have a lot of common words (Feature 
4). Concretely, when the proportion of the same 
quoted part is high or the proportion of the com- 
mon words between two articles is high, our method 
determines that the same topic is discussed in those 
two branches. 
Our method weights the keywords in each article 
according to the positional information and keyword 
frequencies in articles occurring before and after the 
article, and it uses keywords whose score is above a 
given threshold. Concretely, keywords are weighted 
using the following heuristics: 
? Keywords used in sentences which are not 
quoted from the previous article are more im- 
portant han those used in the quoted sentences. 
In particular, keywords used in a sentence next 
to the quoted sentences are the most important 
because a contributor tends to write what he 
wants to say in such a place. 
? Keywords also used in articles before and after 
the article are important because such keywords 
often represent the central topic discussed in the 
stream. 
Our system detects quoted sentences by investi- 
gating the correspondence of sentences between two 
articles related to each other such as a parent-child 
relationship (Uchimoto et al, 1998). 
6.1.4 Exper iment  and Evaluat ion 
We constructed RTs from about 10,000 articles in 
two discussion-type newsgroups, e.g., fj.life.health 
and fj.living. From these RTs we selected 20 RTs 
which consisted of about 400 articles with topic- 
changing articles. We applied our methods after cut- 
ting the headers and footers from the articles. 
In order to evaluate our methods, we also had 
the topic-changing and topic-branching articles iden- 
tified by human subjects. They identified topic- 
changing articles and topic-branching articles by ac- 
tually reading the articles. We selected these as tar- 
get articles, and compared the output of our system 
with the target articles. The results are listed in 
Table 1. 
Our system could correctly identify 18 topic- 
branching articles, and nine of these had more than 
three branches. Our system could correctly iden- 
tify six of the nine. We used the following criterion 
for topic-changing articles; When articles the system 
identifies are the same as the target article, or adja- 
cent to a target article, the system is judged to be 
correct (Uchimoto et al, 1997).

6.2 Actual  Example  and Discussion 
In the experiment in Section 6.1.4, There were 35 
target articles for topic-changing articles and 22 for 
topic-branching ones. Out of these target articles, 
our system could correctly identify 17 articles and 18 
articles respectively. Incidentally, there were three 
articles where the topic changed and branched. 
We structuralized actual articles using the out- 
put of our system and extracted keywords. Fig- 
ure 3 shows part of the structuralized articles, and 
it shows the top four keywords according to their 
scores at the topic-changing and topic-branching ar- 
ticles. The discussion topic was " ~  (static elec- 
tricity)" until article A0. Then, the topic branched 
and changed in the article. The topic changed to 
"Walk Man" in article At, and in article A2, the 
topic about static electricity was discussed through- 
out. 
We want to evaluate our method in the near fu- 
ture using psychological experiments. We need to 
investigate whether the presented keywords are use- 
ful for users to grasp the stream of discussion or not, 
and we need to estimate the number of keywords our 
system should present o users. 
7 Conc lus ion  and  Future  D i rec t ions  
In real articles in network news, writers do not al- 
ways make suitable references to former articles. 
They might refer to all of a former article or only 
talk about a small part. Or, they nfight talk about a 
topic which is mentioned in the former articles which 
is not referred to by their article. It is necessary to 
develop a powerful and precise retrieval system to 
solve, among others, the following problems: 
1. The addition of a better visual man-machine 
interface, users can more easily find where the 
information they need is. 
2. The development of heuristics to define the 
differences in weight of general and domain- 
specific terms. 
3. The improvement in calculation of semantic fea- 
tures of sentences and articles.

We have finished testing our prototype, and we 
are now studying the results in order to develop a 
practical system which will be open to the public. 
We intend to research the problems above to improve
