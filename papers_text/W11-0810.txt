Abstract
Most work on evaluation of named-entity
recognition has been done in the context of
competitions, as a part of Information Extrac-
tion. There has been little work on any form of
extrinsic evaluation, and how one tagger com-
pares with another on the major classes: PER-
SON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION.
We report on a comparison of three state-of-
the-art named entity taggers: Stanford, LBJ,
and IdentiFinder. The taggers were compared
with respect to: 1) Agreement rate on the clas-
sification of entities by class, and 2) Percent-
age of ambiguous entities (belonging to more
than one class) co-occurring in a document.
We found that the agreement between the tag-
gers ranged from 34% to 58%, depending on
the class and that more than 40% of the glob-
ally ambiguous entities co-occur within the
same document. We also propose a unit test
based on the problems we encountered.
1 Introduction
Named-Entity Recognition (NER) has been an im-
portant task in Computational Linguistics for more
than 15 years. The aim is to recognize and clas-
sify different types of entities in text. These might
be people?s names, or organizations, or locations, as
well as dates, times, and currencies. Performance
assessment is usually made in the context of In-
formation Extraction, of which NER is generally a
component. Competitions have been held from the
earliest days of MUC (Message Understanding Con-
ference), to the more recent shared tasks in CoNLL.
Recent research has focused on non-English lan-
guages such as Spanish, Dutch, and German (Meul-
der et al, 2002; Carreras et al, 2003; Rossler, 2004),
and on improving the performance of unsupervised
learning methods (Nadeau et al, 2006; Elsner et al,
2009).
There are no well-established standards for eval-
uation of NER. Since criteria for membership in the
classes can change from one competition to another,
it is often not possible to compare performance di-
rectly. Moreover, since some of the systems in the
competition may use proprietary software, the re-
sults in a competition might not be replicable by
others in the community; however, this applies to
the state of the art for most NLP applications rather
than just NER.
Our work is motivated by a vocabulary as-
sessment project in which we needed to identify
multi-word expressions and determine their asso-
ciation with other words and phrases. However,
we found that state-of-the-art software for named-
entity recognition was not reliable; false positives
and tagging inconsistencies significantly hindered
our work. These results led us to examine the state-
of-the-art in more detail.
The field of Information Extraction (IE) has been
heavily influenced by the Information Retrieval (IR)
community when it comes to evaluation of system
performance. The use of Recall and Precision met-
rics for evaluating IE comes from the IR commu-
nity. However, while the IR community regularly
conducts a set of competitions and shared tasks us-
ing standardized test collections, the IE community
does not. Furthermore, NER is just one component
57
of an IE pipeline and any proposed improvements
to this component must be evaluated by determining
whether the performance of the overall IE pipeline
has improved. However, most, if not all, NER eval-
uations and shared tasks only focus on intrinsic NER
performance and ignore any form of extrinsic eval-
uation. One of the contributions of this paper is
a freely available unit test based on the systematic
problems we found with existing taggers.
2 Evaluation Methodology
We compared three state-of-the-art NER taggers:
one from Stanford University (henceforth, Stanford
tagger), one from the University of Illinois (hence-
forth, the LBJ tagger) and BBN IdentiFinder (hence-
forth, IdentiFinder).
The Stanford Tagger is based on Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (Finkel et al, 2005). It was trained on
100 million words from the English Gigawords cor-
pus. The LBJ Tagger is based on a regularized av-
erage perceptron (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). It was
trained on a subset of the Reuters 1996 news cor-
pus, a subset of the North American News Corpus,
and a set of 20 web pages. The features for both
these taggers are based on local context for a target
word, orthographic features, label sequences, and
distributional similarity. Both taggers include non-
local features to ensure consistency in the tagging of
identical tokens that are in close proximity. Identi-
Finder is a state-of-the-art commercial NER tagger
that uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et
al., 1999).
Since we did not have gold standard annotations
for any of the real-world data we evaluated on, we
instead compared the three taggers along two dimen-
sions:
? Agreement on classification. How well do
the taggers work on the three most diffi-
cult classes: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and
LOCATION and, more importantly, to what
extent does one tagger agree with another?
What types of mistakes do they make system-
atically?1
1Although one could draw a distinction between named en-
tity identification and classification, we focus on the final output
of the taggers, i.e., classified named entities.
? Ambiguity in discourse. Although entities
can potentially have more than one entity clas-
sification, such as Clinton (PERSON or LO-
CATION), it would be surprising if they co-
occurred in a single discourse unit such as a
document. How frequently does each tagger
produce multiple classifications for the same
entity in a single document?
We first compared the two freely available, aca-
demic taggers (Stanford and LBJ) on a corpus of
425 million words that is used internally at the Ed-
ucational Testing Service. Note that we could not
compare these two taggers to IdentiFinder on this
corpus since IdentiFinder is not available for public
use without a license.
Next, we compared all three taggers on the Amer-
ican National Corpus. The American National Cor-
pus (ANC) has recently released a copy which is
tagged by IdentiFinder.2 Since the ANC is a pub-
licly available corpus, we tagged it using both the
Stanford and LBJ taggers and could then compare
all three taggers along the two intended dimensions.
We found that the public corpus had many of the
same problems as the ones we found with our in-
ternally used corpus. Some of these problems have
been discussed before (Marrero et al, 2009) but not
in sufficient detail.
The following section describes our evaluation of
the Stanford and LBJ taggers on the internal ETS
corpus. Section 4 describes a comparison of all three
taggers on the American National Corpus. Section 5
describes the unit test we propose. In Section 6, we
propose and discuss the viability of the ?one named-
entity tag per discourse? hypothesis. In Section 7,
we highlight the problems we find during our com-
parisons and propose a methodology for improved
intrinsic evaluation for NER. Finally, we conclude
in Section 8.
3 Comparing Stanford and LBJ
In this section, we compare the two academic tag-
gers in terms of classification agreement by class
and discourse ambiguity on the ETS SourceFinder
corpus, a heterogeneous corpus containing approx-
imately 425 million words, and more than 270, 000

Table 2: Agreement rate by class between the Stanford and LBJ taggers
articles. The articles were extracted from a set of
60 different journals, newspapers and magazines fo-
cused on both literary and scientific topics.
Although Named Entity Recognition is reported
in the literature to have an accuracy rate of 85-95%
(Finkel et al, 2005; Ratinov and Roth, 2009), it was
clear by inspection that both the Stanford and the
LBJ tagger made a number of mistakes. The ETS
corpus begins with an article about Tim Berners-
Lee, the man who created the World Wide Web.
At the beginning of the article, ?Tim? as well as
?Berners-Lee? are correctly tagged by the Stanford
tagger as belonging to the PERSON class. But
later in the same article, ?Berners-Lee? is incorrectly
tagged as ORGANIZATION. The LBJ tagger makes
many mistakes as well, but they are not necessarily
the same mistakes as the mistakes made by the Stan-
ford tagger. For example, the LBJ tagger sometimes
classifies ?The Web? as a PERSON, and the Stan-
ford tagger classifies ?Italian? as a LOCATION.3
Table 1 provides an anecdotal list of the ?entities?
that were misclassified by the two taggers.4
Both taggers produced about the same number
of entities overall: 1.95 million for Stanford, and
3?Italian? is classified primarily as MISC by the LBJ tagger.
These terms are sometimes called Gentilics or Demonyms.
4Both taggers can use a fourth class MISC in addition to
the standard entity classes PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and
LOCATION. We ran Stanford without the MISC class and LBJ
with MISC. However, the problems highlighted in this paper
remain equally prevalent even without this discrepancy.
1.8 million for LBJ. The agreement rate between
the taggers is shown in Table 2. We find that the
highest rate of agreement is for PERSONS, with
an agreement rate of 58%. The agreement rate on
LOCATIONS is 37%, and the agreement rate on
ORGANIZATIONS is 34%. Even on cases where
the taggers agree, the classification can be incorrect.
Both taggers classify ?African Americans? as LO-
CATIONS.5 Both treat ?Jr.? as being part of a per-
son?s name, as well as being a LOCATION (in fact,
the tagging of ?Jr.? as a LOCATION is more fre-
quent in both).
For our second evaluation criterion, i.e., within-
discourse ambiguity, we determined the percent-
age of globally ambiguous entities (entities that had
more than one classification across the entire corpus)
that occurred with multiple taggings within a single
document. This analysis showed that the problems
described above are not anecdotal. Table 3 shows
that at least 40% of the entities that have more than
one classification co-occur within a document. This
is true for both taggers and all of the named entity
classes.6
5The LBJ tagger classifies the majority of instances of
?African American? as MISC.
6The LBJ tagger also includes the class MISC. We looked at
the co-occurrence rate between the different classes and MISC,
and we found that the majority of each group co-occurred within
a document there as well.

4 Comparing All 3 Taggers
A copy of the American National Corpus was re-
cently released with a tagging by IdentiFinder. We
tagged the corpus with the Stanford and LBJ tagger
to see how the results compared.
We found many of the same problems with the
American National Corpus as we found with the
SourceFinder corpus used in the previous section.
The taggers performed very well for entities that
were common in each class, but we found misclas-
sifications even for terms at the head of the Zipfian
curve. Terms such as ?Drosophila? and ?RNA? were
classified as a LOCATION. ?Affymetrix? was clas-
sified as a PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANI-
ZATION.
Table 4 shows the agreement rate between the
Stanford and IdentiFinder taggers as well as that be-
tween the LBJ and IdentiFinder taggers. A sample
of terms that were classified as belonging to more
than one class, across all 3 taggers, is given in Table
5.
All taggers differ in how the entities are tok-
enized. The Stanford tagger tags each component
word of the multi-word expressions separately. For
example, ?John Smith? is tagged as John/PERSON
and Smith/PERSON. But it would be tagged as
[PER John Smith] by the LBJ tagger, and similarly
by IdentiFinder. This results in a higher overlap be-
tween classes in general, and there is a greater agree-
ment rate between LBJ and IdentiFinder than be-
tween Stanford and either one.
The taggers also differ in the number of entities
that are recognized overall, and the percentage that
are classified in each category. IdentiFinder recog-
nizes significantly more ORGANIZATION entities
than Stanford and LBJ. IdentiFinder also uses a GPE
(Geo-Political Entity) category that is not found in
the other two. This splits the LOCATION class. We
found that many of the entities that were classified as
LOCATION by the other two taggers were classified
as GPE by IdentiFinder.
Although the taggers differ in tokenization as well
as categories, the results on ambiguity in a discourse
support our findings on the larger corpus. The re-
sults are shown in Table 6. For both the Stanford and
LBJ tagger, between 42% and 58% of the entities
with more than one classification co-occur within a
document. For IdentiFinder, the co-occurrence rate
was high for two of the groupings, but significantly
less for PERSON and GPE.
5 Unit Test for NER
We created a unit test based on our experiences in
comparing the different taggers. We were particular
about choosing examples that test the following:
1. Capitalized, upper case, and lower case ver-
sions of entities that are true positives for PER-
SON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION (for
a variety of frequency ranges).
2. Terms that are entirely in upper case that are not
named entities (such as RNA and AAARGH).

hyphens, and expressions (such as ?A.sub.1?)
that are clearly not named entities.
4. Terms that contain an initial, such as ?T. Rex?,
?M.I.T?, and ?L.B.J.?
5. Acronym forms such as ETS and MIT, some
with an expanded form and some without.
6. Last names that appear in close proximity to the
full name (first and last). This is to check on the
impact of discourse and consistency of tagging.
7. Terms that contain a preposition, such as ?Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology?. This is in-
tended to test for correct extent in identifying
the entity.
8. Terms that are a part of a location as well as an
organization. For example, ?Amherst, MA? vs.
?Amherst College?.
An excerpt from this unit test is shown in Table 7.
We provide more information about the full unit test
at the end of the paper.
6 One Named-Entity Tag per Discourse
Previous papers have noted that it would be unusual
for multiple occurrences of a token in a document to
be classified as a different type of entity (Mikheev
et al, 1999; Curran and Clark, 2003). The Stan-
ford and LBJ taggers have features for non-local de-
pendencies for this reason. The observation is sim-
ilar to a hypothesis proposed by Gale, Church, and
Yarowsky with respect to word-sense disambigua-
tion and discourse (Gale et al, 1992). They hypoth-
esized that when an ambiguous word appears in a
document, all subsequent instances of that word in
the document will have the same sense. This hy-
pothesis is incorrect for word senses that we find in
a dictionary (Krovetz, 1998) but is likely to be cor-
rect for the subset of the senses that are homony-
mous (unrelated in meaning). Ambiguity between
named entities is similar to homonymy, and for most
entities it is unlikely that they would co-occur in a
document.7 However, there are cases that are excep-
tions. For example, Finkel et al (2005) note that in
the CoNLL dataset, the same term can be used for a
location and for the name of a sports team. Ratinov
and Roth (2009) note that ?Australia? (LOCATION)
can occur in the same document as ?Bank of Aus-
tralia? (ORGANIZATION).
Existing taggers treat the non-local dependencies
as a way of dealing with the sparse data problem,
and as a way to resolve tagging differences by look-
ing at how often one token is classified as one type
7Krovetz (1998) provides some examples where different
named entities co-occur in a discourse, such as ?New York?
(city) and ?New York? (state). However, these are both in the
same class (LOCATION) and are related to each other.
61
This is not a Unit Test
(a tribute to Rene Magritte and RMS)
Although we created this test with humor, we intend it as a serious
test of the phenomena we encountered. These problems include
ambiguity between entities (such as Bill Clinton and Clinton,
Michigan), uneven treatment of variant forms (MIT, M.I.T., and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology - these should all be
labeled the same in this text - are they?), and frequent false
positives such as RNA and T. Rex.
...
Table 7: Excerpt from a Unit test for Named-Entity Recognition
versus another. We propose that these dependencies
can be used in two other aspects: (a) as a source
of error in evaluation and, (b) as a way to identify
semantically related entities that are systematic ex-
ceptions. There is a grammar to named entity types.
?Bank of Australia? is a special case of Bank of
[LOCATION]. The same thing is true for ?China
Daily? as a name for a newspaper. We propose that
co-occurrences of different labels for particular in-
stances can be used to create such a grammar; at the
very least, particular types of co-occurrences should
be treated as an exception to what is otherwise an
indication of a tagging mistake.
7 Discussion
The Message Understanding Conference (MUC) has
guidelines for named-entity recognition. But the
guidelines are just that. We believe that there should
be standards. Without such standards it is difficult
to determine which tagger is correct, and how the
accuracy varies between the classes.
We propose that the community focus on four
classes: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCA-
TION, and MISC. This does not mean that the other
classes are not important. Rather it is recognition of
the following facts:
? These classes are more difficult than dates,
times, and currencies.
? There is widespread disagreement between tag-
gers on these classes, and evidence that they are
misclassifying unique entities a significant per-
centage of the time.
? We need at least one class for handling terms
that do not fit into the first three classes.
? The first three classes have important value in
other areas of NLP.
Although we recognize that an extrinsic evalu-
ation of named entity recognition would be ideal,
we also realize that intrinsic evaluations are valu-
able in their own right. We propose that the exist-
ing methodology for intrinsically evaluating named
entity taggers can be improved in the following man-
ner:
1. Create test sets that are organized across a va-
riety of domains. It is not enough to work with
newswire and biomedical text.
2. Use standardized sets that are designed to test
different types of linguistic phenomena, and
make it a de facto norm to use more than one
set as part of an evaluation.
3. Report accuracy rates separately for the three
major classes. Accuracy rates should be further
broken down according to the items in the unit
test that are designed to assess mistakes: or-
thography, acronym processing, frequent false
positives, and knowledge-based classification.
4. Establish a way for a tagging system to express
uncertainty about a classification.
62
The approach taken by the American National
Corpus is a good step in the right direction. Like
the original Brown Corpus and the British National
Corpus, it breaks text down according to informa-
tional/literary text types, and spoken versus written
text. The corpus also includes text that is drawn from
the literature of science and medicine. However, the
relatively small number of files in the corpus makes
it difficult to assess accuracy rates on the basis of re-
peated occurrences within a document, but with dif-
ferent tags. Because there are hundreds of thousands
of files in the internal ETS corpus, there are many
opportunities for observations. The tagged version
of the American National Corpus has about 8800
files. This is one of the biggest differences between
the evaluation on the corpus we used internally at
ETS and the American National Corpus.
The use of a MISC class is needed for reasons
that are independent of certainty. This is why we
propose a goal of allowing systems to express this
aspect of the classification. We suggest a meta-tag of
a question-mark. The meta-tag can be applied to any
class. Entities for which the system is uncertain can
then be routed for active learning. This also allows a
basic separation of entities into those for which the
system is confident of its classification, and those for
which it is not.
8 Conclusion
Although Named Entity Recognition has a reported
accuracy rate of more than 90%, the results show
they make a significant number of mistakes. The
high accuracy rates are based on inadequate meth-
ods for testing performance. By considering only
the entities where both taggers agree on the classifi-
cation, it is likely that we can obtain improved accu-
racy. But even so, there are cases where both taggers
agree yet the agreement is on an incorrect tagging.
The unit test for assessing NER performance is
freely available to download.8
As with Information Retrieval test collections, we
hope that this becomes one of many, and that they be
adopted as a standard for evaluating performance.
