Abstract 
An unsupervised learning method, based 
on corpus linguistics and special lan-
guage terminology, is described that can 
extract time-varying information from 
text streams.  The method is shown to be 
?language-independent? in that its use 
leads to sets of regular-expressions that 
can be used to extract the information in 
typologically distinct languages like Eng-
lish and Arabic.  The method uses the in-
formation related to the distribution of N-
grams, for automatically extracting 
?meaning bearing? patterns of usage in a 
training corpus. The analysis of an Eng-
lish news wire corpus (1,720,142 tokens) 
and Arabic news wire corpus (1,720,154 
tokens) show encouraging results. 
1 Introduction  
One of the recent trends in (adaptive) IE has 
been motivated by the empirical argument that 
annotated corpora, either annotated automatically 
or annotated manually, can provide sufficient 
information for creating the knowledge base of 
an IE system (McLernon and Kushmerick, 
2006).  Another equally important trend is to use 
manually selected seed patterns to initiate learn-
ing: In turn, active-training methods use seed 
patterns to learn new related patterns from un-
annotated corpora.   Many of the adaptive IE sys-
tems rely on the existing part-of-speech (POS) 
taggers (Debnath and Giles, 2005) and/or syntac-
tic parsers (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) for 
analysing and annotating text corpora. The use of 
corpora in IE, especially adaptive IE, should, in 
principle, alleviate the need for manually creat-
ing the rules for information extraction. 
  
The successful use of POS/syntactic taggers is 
dependent on the availability of the knowledge 
of (natural) language used by the authors of 
documents in a given corpus.  There is a wealth 
of POS taggers and parsers available for English 
language, as it has been the most widely used 
language in computational linguistics.  However, 
this is not the case for strategically important 
languages like Arabic and Chinese; to start with, 
in Chinese one does not have the luxury of sepa-
rating word-tokens by a white space and in Ara-
bic complex rules are required to identify mor-
phemes compared to English.  The development 
of segmentation programs in these languages has 
certainly helped (Gao et al, 2005; Habash and 
Rambow, 2005).  More work is needed in under-
standing these languages such that the knowl-
edge thus derived can be used to power taggers 
and parsers. 
Typically, IE systems are used to analyse 
news wire corpora, telephone conversations, and 
more recently in bio-informatics.  The first two 
systems deal with language of everyday commu-
nications ?the general language- whereas bio-
informatics deals with a specialist domain and 
has its own ?special language?.  English special 
languages, for example languages of law, com-
merce, finance, science & technology, each have 
a limited vocabulary and idiosyncratic syntactic 
structures when compared with English used in 
an everyday context.  The same is true of Ger-
man, French, Russian, Chinese, Arabic or Hindi.  
It appears that few works, if any, take advantage 
of the properties of special language to build IE 
systems. 
Our objective is to use methods and tech-
niques of IE in the automatic analysis of special-
ist news that streams in such a way that informa-
tion extracted at an earlier period of time may be 
contradicted or reinforced by information ex-
tracted at a later time.  The impact of news on 
financial and commodity markets is of consider-
56
able import and is often called sentiment analy-
sis.  The prefix ?sentiment? is used to distinguish 
this kind of analysis from the more quantitative 
analysis of assets (called fundamental analysis) 
and that of price movements (called technical 
analysis).  There is a great deal of discussion in 
financial economics, econometrics, and in the 
newly emergent discipline of investor psychol-
ogy about the impact of ?good? and ?bad? news 
on the behaviour of both investors and brokers.  
Three Nobel Prizes have been awarded on the 
impact of market (trader and investor) sentiment 
on the value of shares, currencies, derivatives 
and other financial instruments (Shiller, 2000).  
Financial news, in addition to e-mails and blogs, 
has contributed to the catastrophic failures of 
major trading institutions (Mackenzie, 2000; 
Hardie & Mackenzie, 2005). 
One of the key proponents of news impact 
analysis is the Economics Nobel Laureate Robert 
Engle who has written about asymmetry of in-
formation in a market ? the brokers have more 
knowledge than any given individual, rumours 
have different impact on different actors in the 
market.  Engle?s statistical analysis suggests that 
the ?bad? news has longer lasting effect than 
?good? news (Engle, 1993).  Usually, sentiment 
analysis is carried out using news proxies which 
include dates/times and the names of agencies 
releasing key items of financial data (Anderson 
et al, 2002) or data like the age of a firm, its 
number of initial public offerings, return on in-
vestment, etc.  These proxies are then regressed 
with share, currency or commodity prices.  News 
impact analysis is moving into its next phase 
where the text of news is analysed albeit to a lim-
ited extent (Cutler et al, 1989; Chan, 2003).  The 
analysis sometimes looks at the frequency distri-
bution of pre-specified keywords ?directional 
metaphors like rose/fall, up/down, health meta-
phors like anaemic/healthy and animal meta-
phors like bullish/bearish.   A system is trained 
to correlate and to learn the changes in distribu-
tion of the prescribed metaphorical keywords, 
together with names of organisations, to the 
changes in the value of financial instruments 
(Seo et al, 2002; Omrane et al, 2005; Koppel 
and Shtrimberg 2004).   
We are attempting to create a language-
informed framework for news impact analysis 
using techniques of corpus linguistics and special 
language analysis.  The purpose is to automati-
cally extract patterns from a corpus of domain 
specific texts without prescribing the metaphori-
cal keywords and organisation names.  This, we 
believe, can be achieved by looking at the lexical 
signature of a specialist domain and extracting 
collocational patterns of the individual items of 
the lexical signature.  The lexical signature in-
cludes key vocabulary items of the domain and 
names of people, places and things in the do-
main.  There are instances in the part-of-speech 
tagging literature (Brill, 1993) and in IE where a 
corpus is used and words within a grammatical 
category help to extract rules and patterns com-
prising essential information about a domain or 
topic (Wilks, 1998; Yangarber, 2003).  Brill, 
Wilks and Yangarber induce grammars of a uni-
versal kind:  we focus on inducing a local gram-
mar that deals with the patterning of the items in 
the signature.  Note that in all these cases of 
grammar induction the intuition of the grammar 
builder plays a critical part whether it be in the 
choice of syntactic transformation rules (Brill 
1993), or in choosing sense taggers and implic-
itly semantic rules (Wilks, 1998; Ciravegna and 
Wilks, 2003), or in choosing user supplied seed 
patterns (Yangarber, 2003).  Most of the work in 
grammar induction is focussed on English or ty-
pologically similar languages.  We have deliber-
ately chosen typologically different languages 
(English and Arabic) to evaluate the extent to 
which our method of ?grammar induction? is lan-
guage independent. 
We describe a method for building domain 
specific IE systems:  the patterns used to extract 
domain specific information are the N-gram col-
location patterns of domain specific terms.  The 
patterns are extracted from un-annotated domain-
specific text corpora. We show how one can ana-
lyse the N-gram patterns and render them as 
regular expressions.   
The thesaurus used to identify domain specific 
words is itself constructed automatically from a 
(training) special-language corpus.  The fre-
quency distribution of domain specific terms in a 
special language corpus shows characteristic dif-
ferences from the distribution of the same terms 
in a general language corpus.  There is little or 
no difference in the distribution of the so-called 
grammatical or closed class terms in a special 
and a general language corpus.   
Furthermore, amongst the domain specific 
terms, a few tend to dominate the frequency dis-
tribution ? the so-called lexical signature of a 
domain.  These signature terms are used as nu-
cleates for compound terms in a domain. The 
occurrence of the signature terms, either on their 
own or in a compound or a phrase, is equally 
idiosyncratic in that these dominant single or 
57
compound terms co-occur more frequently with 
one set of words than with others.  The behaviour 
of signature terms appears to be governed by a 
grammar that is local to the specialism and is not 
elsewhere in the general language (Harris, 1991); 
local grammar is used in general language for 
telling times and dates in metaphorical expres-
sions (Gross, 1997), and in the lexicography for 
describing the language of definitions of lemmas 
in a lexicon (Barnbrook and Sinclair, 1996; 
Barnbrook, 2002).  The local grammar approach, 
rooted in the lexical signature of a given domain 
can be used to extract ?sentiment? bearing sen-
tences in financial markets (Ahmad el al., 2006) 
or in the description of work in a scientific labo-
ratory (Ahmad & Al-Sayed, 2005). 
We introduce a system that can help in build-
ing domain specific IE systems in English and 
languages that are typologically distinct from 
English, specifically Arabic.  The development 
of LoLo was inspired by Engle?s pioneering 
work in econometrics where news impact analy-
sis is regarded as critical to the analysis of mar-
ket movement: however much of the work in 
financial economics relates to the correlation of 
the timings of news announcements rather than 
the content of the news stream (Ahmad et al, 
2006). 
LoLo can manage a corpus and extract key 
terms. Given the keyword list, the system then 
identifies collocates and selects significant collo-
cates on well defined statistical criterion 
(Smadja, 1994).  Finally, local grammar rules are 
identified and an IE system is created.   
LoLo has been used to build a local grammar 
to extract ?sentiment? or key (changing) market 
events in English and in Arabic from unseen 
texts.  The system can help visualise the distribu-
tion of extracted patterns synchronised with the 
movement of financial markets.   
IE systems need to be adaptive, as the special-
isms in particular and the world in general is 
changing rapidly and this change is usually re-
flected in language use.  There is an equally im-
portant need to build cross language IE systems 
as information may be in different languages.  
The lexically-motivated approach we describe in 
this paper responds to the need for an adaptive, 
cross domain and cross language IE systems.   
2 Method 
For the extraction of local grammar from a 
corpus of special language texts it is important to 
focus on the keywords.  The patterns in which 
the keywords are embedded are assumed to com-
prise the principal elements of a subject specific 
local grammar.    
The manner in which we derive the local 
grammar is shown in the algorithm below (Fig-
ure 1).   
 
ALGORITHM: DISCOVER LOCAL GRAMMAR 
1. SELECT a special language corpus (SL, comprising 
Nspecial words and vocabulary VSpecial).   
i. USE a frequency list of single words from a corpus of 
texts used in day-to-day communications (SG comprising 
Ngeneral words and vocabulary Vgeneral) ? for example, the 
British National Corpus for the English language: 
Fgeneral:={f(w1),f(w2),f(w3)??.fVgeneral} 
ii. CREATE a frequency ordered list of words in SL texts is 
computed  
Fspecial:={f(w1), f(w2), f(w3)???} 
iii. COMPUTE the differences in the distribution of the 
same words in the two different corpora is computed us-
ing the in SG and SL: 
Weirdness (wi)= f(wi)special/f(wi)general* 
 Ngeneral/Nspecial 
iv. CALCULATE z-score for the Fspeical  
zf(wi)=(f(wi)-fav_special)/?special 
2. CREATE KEY a set of Nkey keywords ordered accord-
ing to the magnitude of the two z-scores 
KEY:={key1, key2, key3??keyNkey) 
 such that z(fkeyi) & z(weridnesskeyi)> 1 
i. EXTRACT collocates of each Key in SL over a window 
of M word neighbourhood.  
ii. COMPUTE the strength of collocation using three meas-
ures due to Smadja (1994): 
U-score, k, and z-score 
iii. EXTRACT sentences in the corpus that comprise highly 
collocating key-words ((U,ko,k1)>=(10,1,1))   
iv. FORM Corpus SL? 
a. For each Sentencei in SL?:  
b. COMPUTE the frequency of every word in Sentencei.   
c. REPLACE words with frequency less than a threshold 
value (fthreshold) by a place marker #; 
d. FOR more than one contiguous place marker, use*  
3. GENERATE trigrams in SL?;  note frequency of each 
trigram together with its position in the sentences:  
i. FIND all the longest possible contiguous trigrams 
across all sentences in SL? and note their frequency 
ii. ORDER the (contiguous) trigrams according to fre-
quency of occurrence 
iii. (CONTIGUOUS) TRIGRAMS with frequency above a 
threshold form THE LOCAL GRAMMAR 
Figure 1. Algorithm for the acquisition of local-
grammar patterns. 
 
Briefly, given a specialist corpus (SL), key-
words are identified, and collocates of the key-
words are extracted.  Sentences containing key 
collocates are then used to construct a sub-corpus 
(SL?).  The sub-corpus SL? is then analyzed and 
trigrams above a frequency threshold in the sub-
corpus are extracted; the position of the trigrams 
in each of the sentences is also noted.  The sub-
corpus is searched again for contiguous trigrams 
across the sentences:   The sentences are ana-
lyzed for the existence of the trigrams in the cor-
rect position ? if a trigram that, for example, is 
noted for its frequency as a sentence initial posi-
tion, is found to co-occur with another frequent 
trigram that exists at the next position, then the 
two trigrams will be deemed to form a pattern.  
58
This process is continued until all the trigrams in 
the sentence are matched with the significant 
trigrams.   
The local grammar then comprises significant 
contiguous trigrams that are found.  These do-
main specific patterns, extracted from the spe-
cialist corpus SL? (and its constituent sub-corpus) 
are then used to extract similar patterns and in-
formation from a test corpus to validate the pat-
terns thus found in the training corpus. Following 
is a demonstration of how the algorithm works 
using English and Arabic texts. 
2.1 Extracting Patterns in English 
We present an analysis of a corpus of financial 
news wire texts: 1204 news report produced by 
Reuters UK Financial News comprising 431,850 
tokens.  One of the frequent words in the corpus 
is percent? 3622 occurrences, a relative fre-
quency of 0.0084%.  When the frequency of this 
keyword is looked up in the British National 
Corpus (100 million words), it was found that 
percent is 287 times more frequent in the finan-
cial corpus than in the British National Corpus ? 
this ratio is sometimes termed weirdness (of spe-
cial language); the weirdness of grammatical 
words the and to is unity as these tokens are dis-
tributed with the same (relative) frequency in 
Reuters Financial and the BNC.  The z-score 
computed using the frequency of the token in the 
Reuters Financial is 12.64: the distribution of 
percent is 12 standard deviations above the mean 
of all words in the financial corpus.  (The z-score 
computed for weirdness is positive as well).  The 
heuristic here is this: a token is a candidate key-
word if both its z-scores are greater than a small 
positive number.  So percent -most frequent to-
ken with frequency and weirdness z-score over 
zero- was accepted as a keyword.   
The collocates of the keyword percent were 
then extracted by using mutual information sta-
tistics presented by Smadja (1994).  A collocate 
in this terminology can be anywhere in the vicin-
ity of +/- N-words.  The frequency at each 
neighbourhood is calculated and then used to 
compute the ?peaks? in the histogram formed by 
the neighbourhood frequencies and the strength 
of the collocation calculated on a similar basis.  
The keyword generally collocates with certain 
words that have frequencies higher than itself ?
the upward collocates- and collocates with cer-
tain words that have lesser frequency ? the down-
wards collocates (These terms were coined by 
John Sinclair).  Upwards collocates are usually 
grammatical words and downwards collocates 
are lexical words ? nouns, adjectives- and hence 
the downwards collocates are treated as candi-
date compound words.  There were 46 collocates 
of percent in our corpus ? 34 downwards collo-
cates and 12 upwards collocates.  A selection of 
5 downwards and upwards are shown in Table 1 
and 2 respectively.

Table 2. Upward collocates of percent in a cor-
pus of 431,850 words. 
 
 
The financial texts comprise a large number of 
numerals (integers and decimals) and these we 
will denote as <no>.  The numerals collocate 
strongly with percent for obvious reasons.  The 
collocates are then used to extract trigrams com-
prising the collocates that occur at particular po-
sitions in the various sentences of our corpus: 
 
 
Token A Token B Token C Freq Position 
<no> percent and 16 1 
rose <no> percent 18 1 
<no> percent after 23 2 
<no> percent of 47 2 
<no> percent rise 11 2 
Table 3. Trigrams of percent. 
 
 
There are many other frequent patterns where 
the frequency of individual tokens is quite low 
but at least one member of the trigram has higher 
frequency: such low frequency tokens are omit-
ted and marked by the (#) symbol. All the tri-
grams containing such tokens with at least two 
others are used to extract other significant tri-
grams. Sometimes more than one low frequency 
tokens precede or succeed high frequency tokens 
and they are denoted by the symbol (*) as shown 
in Table 4. The search for contiguous trigrams 
leads to larger and more complex patterns, Table 
5 provides some examples.

rose <no> percent 18 1

2.2 Extracting Patterns in Arabic 
Arabic is written from right to left and its writ-
ing system does not employ capitalization. The 
language is highly inflected compared to Eng-
lish; words are generated using a root-and-
pattern morphology. Prefixes and suffixes can be 
attached to the morphological patterns for gram-
matical purposes. For example, the grammatical 
conjunction ?and? in Arabic is attached to the 
beginning of the following word. Words are also 
sensitive to the gender and number they refer to 
and their lexical structure change accordingly. 
As a result, more word types can be found in 
Arabic corpora compared to English of same size 
and type. Short vowels which are represented as 
marks in Arabic are also omitted from usual 
Arabic texts resulting in some words having 
same lexical structures but different semantics.  
These grammatical and lexical features of 
Arabic cause more complexity and ambiguity, 
especially for NLP systems designed for thor-
ough processing of Arabic texts compared to 
English. A shallow and statistical approach for 
IE using texts of specialism can be useful to ab-
stract many complexities of Arabic texts. 
Given a 431,563 word corpus comprising 
2559 texts of Reuters Arabic Financial News and 
the same thresholds we used with the English 
corpus, percent (al-meaa, QRST?) is again the most 
frequent term with frequency and weirdness z-
score greater than zero. It has 3125 occurrences 
(0.0072%), a frequency z-score of 19.03 and a 
weirdness of 76 compared against our Modern 
Standard Arabic Corpus (MSAC).  
There were 31 collocates of percent; 7 up-
wards and 23 downwards. The downwards collo-
cates of percent appear to collocate with names 
of instruments i.e. shares and indices (Table 6). 
The upwards collocate are with the so-called 
closed class words as in English like in, on and 
that (Table 7).

Using the same thresholds the trigrams (Table 
8) appear to be different from the English tri-
grams in that the words of movement are not in-
cluded here ? this is because Arabic has a richer 
morphological system compared to English and 
Financial Arabic is not as standardised as Finan-
cial English: however, it will not be difficult to 
train the system to recognise the variants of rose 
and fell   in Financial Arabic. Table 9 lists some

3 Experimental Results 
We have argued that a method that is focused on 
frequency at the lexical level(s) of linguistic de-
scription ? single words, compounds, and N-
grams- will perhaps lead to patterns that are idio-
syncratic of a specialist domain without recourse 
to a thesaurus.  There are a number of linguistic 
methods ? that focus on syntactic and semantic 
level of description which might be of equal or 
better use.  
In order to show the effectiveness of our 
method we apply it to sentiment analysis ? an 
analysis that attempts to extract qualitative opin-
ion expressed about a range of human and natu-
ral artefacts ? films, cars, financial instruments 
for instance.  Broadly speaking, sentiments in 
financial markets relate to the ?rise? and ?fall? of 
financial instruments (shares, currencies, com-
modities and energy prices): inextricably these 
sentiments relate to change in the prices of the 
instruments.  In both English and Arabic, we 
have found that percent or equivalent is a key-
word and trigrams and longer N-grams embed-
ded with this keyword relate to metaphorical 
movement words? up, down, rise, fall.  However, 
in English this association is further contextual-
ised with other keywords ? shares, stocks- and in 
Arabic the contextualisation is with shares and 
the principal commodity of many Arab states 
economies ? oil.  Our system ?discovered? both 
by following a lexical level of linguistic descrip-
tion. 
For each of the two languages of interest to us, 
we have created 1.72 million token corpora.  
Each corpus was then divided into two (roughly) 
equal sized sub corpora: training corpus and test-
ing corpus; the testing corpus is sub-divided into 
two testing corpora Test1 and Test2 (Table 10).  
First, we extract patterns from the Training Cor-
pus using the discover local grammar algorithm 
(Figure 1) and also from Test1.  Next, the Train-
ing1 and Test1 corpora are merged and patterns 
extracted from the merged corpus.  The intuition 
we have is that as the size of the corpus is in-
creased the patterns extracted from a smaller 
sized corpus will be elaborated: some of the pat-
terns that are idiosyncratic of the smaller sized 
corpus will become statistically insignificant and 
hence will be ignored.  The conventional way of 
testing would have been to see how many pat-
terns discovered in the training corpus are found 
in the testing corpora; we are quantifying these 
results currently. In the following we describe an 
initial test of our method after introducing LoLo.

3.1 LoLo 
LoLo (stands for Local-Grammar for Learning 
Terminology and means ?pearl? in Arabic) is de-
veloped using the .NET platform. It contains four 
components summarised in Table 11.

Table 11. Summary of LoLo?s components. 
61
The various components of LoLo ?the Ana-
lyser, Editor, Extractor and the Visualiser, can 
be used to extract and present patterns; the sys-
tem has utilities to change script and the direc-
tion of writing (Arabic is right-to-left and Eng-
lish left-to-right). Table 12 is an exemplar output 
from LoLo: ?rise in profit? event patterns ex-
pressed similarly in English and Arabic financial 
news headlines found by the Corpus Analyser. 
 
English *  profit  up  <no>  percent 
 ?^yz?    ??^Y??   <no> *  kl     QRST?  Arabic percent  in            profit  rise (up) 
Table 12. ?Rise in profit? patterns in Arabic and 
English where the * usually comprises names of 
organisations or enterprises. 
 
 
The pattern acquisition algorithm presented 
earlier is implemented in the Corpus Analyser 
component, which is the focus of this paper. It 
can be used for discovering frequent patterns in 
corpora. The user has the option to filter smaller 
patterns contained in larger ones and to mine for 
interrupted or non-interrupted patterns. It can 
also distinguish between single word and multi 
word slots. 
Before mining for patterns, a corpus pre-
processor routine performs a few operations to 
improve the pattern discovery. It identifies any 
punctuation marks attached to the words and 
separates them. it also identifies the sentences 
boundaries and converts all the numerical tokens 
to one tag ?<no>? as numbers can be part of 
some patterns, especially in the domain of finan-
cial news.   
The Rules Editor is at its initial stages of de-
velopment, currently it can export the extraction 
patterns discovered by the Corpus Analyser as 
regular expressions. 
A time-stamped corpus can be visualised us-
ing the Information Visualiser. The Visualiser 
can display a time-series that shows how the ex-
tracted events emerge, repeat and fade over time 
in relation to other events or imported time series 
i.e. of financial instruments. This can be useful 
for analysing any relations between different 
events or detecting trends in one or more corpora 
or with other time-series.  
LoLo facilitates other corpus and computa-
tional linguistics tasks as well, including generat-
ing concordances and finding collocations from 
texts encoded in UTF-8. This is particularly use-
ful for Arabic and languages using the Arabic 
writing system like Persian and Urdu which lack 
such resources. 
3.2 Training and Testing 
3.2.1 English 
We consider the English Training1 corpus first.  
We extracted the significant collocates of all the 
high frequency/high weirdness words, where 
?high? defined using the associated z-scores, in 
the training corpus.  Trigrams were then ex-
tracted and high frequency trigrams were chosen 
and all sentences comprising the trigrams were 
used to form a (training) sub corpus.  The sub-
corpus was then analysed for extracting the local 
grammar. 
The 10 high frequency N-grams extracted 
automatically from the Training1 Corpus 
(861,492) are listed in Table 13. The Test1 cor-
pus has most of the trigrams in the Training1 
corpus, particularly some of the larger N-grams 
(Table 14).

We then merged the Training1 and Test1 cor-
pora together and created Training2 corpus com-
prising of 3612 texts and 1,293,342 tokens.  The 
Algorithm was executed on the merged corpus 
and a new set of patterns were extracted, in par-
ticular the most frequent pattern in the Training1 
Corpus (<s> the * <no> percent), was elabo-
62
rated by the Algorithm as well as those patterns 
shown in Table 15.

Training1 and Training2 corpora. 
 
 
The patterns related to the collocations of 
shares and percent from Training1 were pre-
served in Training2.  The test on Test2 corpus 
showed similar results: the smaller N-grams re-
lated to the movement of instruments were simi-
lar to the Test1 Corpus. The analysis of Arabic 
texts is shown below with similar results. 
3.2.2 Arabic 
Some of frequent N-grams extracted automati-
cally from the Training1 Arabic corpus (860,020) 
are shown in Table 16. Similar to the English 
corpora the Test1 Arabic corpus has most of the 
trigrams in the Training1 Corpus and some larger 
N-grams(Table 17).

After merging the Training1 and Test1 Arabic 
corpora together into a corpus of 7677 texts and 
1,293,342 tokens, new set of patterns were ex-
tracted as well. Some of the frequent patterns in 
the training corpus were elaborated more as well 
like the pattern shown in Table 18 where the to-
ken and-rise (wa-ertifaa, ??qyz? ) was added to the 
pattern.

4 Evaluation 
We have used the Rules Editor and the Informa-
tion Extractor to evaluate the patterns on a cor-
pus comprising 2408 texts and 858,650 tokens 
created by merging Test1 and Test2 corpora. The 
Arabic evaluation corpus comprised 5118 texts 
and 860,134 tokens.  The N-gram pattern extrac-
tor (where N > 4) showed considerable promise 
in that who or what went up/or down was unam-
biguously extracted from the English test corpus 
using patterns generated through the training 
corpus. Initial results show high precision with 
the longer N-grams in English (Table 19) and 
Arabic (Table 20).

However, some patterns return many extracted 
information that require trimming. For example 
many organizations names are extracted in Ara-
bic using the pattern shown in table 21 but they 
usually have the word by-a-ratio (be-nesba, QVWXY) 
attached at the end resulting in low precision.

Table 21. Patterns with low precision in English 
and Arabic 
 
 
Because we have used the same training 
thresholds for English and Arabic, the patterns in 
Arabic appeared without the motion words. 
However the system can extract these words 
along with the org/instrument/index names be-
cause they appear frequently as slots in the pat-
terns. 
The N-gram patterns (when N ? 4) show poor 
results in that either such patterns found in the 
training corpus are not found in the test corpus, 
or the patterns retrieved from test corpora are at 
semantic variance with the same pattern in the 
training corpus.  This suggests that there is an 
optimal length of individual patterns in our local 
grammar. 
5 Afterword 
The patterns extracted from the English (and 
Arabic) corpora confirm to an extent the view of 
the proponents of local grammar, of a special 
language, that there are certain words (in our 
case percent, shares, index) that appear to have a 
specific grammatical category in the sense that 
the neighbourhood of these words is occupied by 
a small number of other words (up, down, fall, 
rise, <no> for instance). If we were to apply the 
grammars typically used in part-of-speech tag-
gers and syntactic parsing in general, the idio-
syncratic behaviour of the pivotal keywords in 
specialist language does not become apparent: 
the pivotal keywords are regarded as noun 
phrases and the association of these phrases is 
with other general categories of verb phrase, ad-
jectival phrase and adverbial phrase.  
The patterns we have extracted could have 
been extracted with the help of a thesaurus.  And, 
this is the question which is critical to us: how to 
create and maintain a thesaurus within a domain.  
This is illustrated in a small way by our experi-
ment on the Training1 corpus where the term in-
dex was not statistically significant for it to ap-
pear in the trigrams that populate the local 
grammar.  However, in Training2, the larger cor-
pus did contain significant frequency of the term 
index for it to make into a pattern of its own.  
Furthermore, many of the patterns in Training1 
persisted in Training2.  Smaller N-grams persist 
as well in the various Training and Test corpora 
? these patterns in themselves act like units 
around which other trigrams nucleate. 
The evaluation of our Algorithm is still con-
tinuing and we are in the process of setting up 
experiments with human volunteers, especially 
those with some knowledge of financial matters 
to evaluate the output of LoLo.  We intend to use 
information retrieval metrics of recall and the 
various F? measures. 
 The local grammar movement has made er-
ratic progress since its inception in the 1960?s.  
Now, with the advent of accessible computers 
with substantive memories, with the advent of 
the Internet and the concomitant treasure of 
multi-lingual text deposits and text streams, one 
can explore the use of such grammars in address-
ing the major challenges in information extrac-
tion.
