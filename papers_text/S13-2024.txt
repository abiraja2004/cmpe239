Abstract
This paper describes The University of Mel-
bourne NLP group submission to the Cross-
lingual Textual Entailment shared task, our
first tentative attempt at the task. The ap-
proach involves using parallel corpora and au-
tomatic word alignment to align text fragment
pairs, and statistics based on unaligned words
as features to classify items as forward and
backward before a compositional combination
into the final four classes, as well as exper-
iments with additional string similarity fea-
tures.
1 Introduction
Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) (Negri et
al., 2012) proposes the task of automatically iden-
tifying the kind of relation that exists between pairs
of semantically-related text fragments written in two
distinct languages, a variant of the traditional Rec-
ognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task (Bentivogli
et al, 2009; Bentivogli et al, 2010). The task tar-
gets the cross-lingual content synchronization sce-
nario proposed in Mehdad et al (2010, 2011). Com-
positional classification can be used by training two
distinct binary classifiers for forward and backward
entailment classification, before combining labels
into the four final entailment categories that now in-
clude bidirectional and no entailment labels. The
most similar previous work to this work is the cross-
lingual approach of the FBK system (Mehdad et
al., 2012) from Semeval 2012 (Negri et al, 2012),
in which the entailment classification is obtained
without translating T1 into T2 for the Spanish?
English language pair. We apply the cross-lingual
approach to German?English and instead of cross-
lingual matching features, we use Giza++ (Och et
al., 1999) and Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) to auto-
matically word align text fragment pairs to compute
statistics of unaligned words. In addition, we in-
clude some additional experiments using string sim-
ilarity features.
2 Compositional Classification
Given a pair of topically related fragments, T1 (Ger-
man) and T2 (English), we automatically annotate it
with one of the following entailment labels: bidi-
rectional, forward, backward, no entailment. We
take the compositional approach and separately train
a forward, as well as a backward binary classifier.
Each classifier is run separately on the set of text
fragment pairs to produce two binary labels for for-
ward and backward entailment. The two sets of la-
bels are logically combined to produce a final clas-
sification for each test pair of forward, backward,
bidirectional or no entailment.
3 Word Alignment Features
The test set of topically-related text fragments, T1
(German) and T2 (English) were added to Europarl
German?English parallel text (Koehn, 2005) and
Giza++ was used for automatic word alignment in
both language directions. Moses (Koehn et al,
2007) was then used for symmetrization with the
grow diag final and algorithm. This produces a
many-to-many alignment between the words of the
133
German, T1, and English, T2, with words also re-
maining unaligned.
The following features are computed for each test
pair feature scores for the forward classifier:
? A1: count of unaligned words in T2
? A2: count of words comprised soley of digits
in T2 not in T1
? A3: count of unaligned words in T2 with low
probability of appearing unaligned in Europarl
(with threshold p=0.11)
The number of words in T2 (English) that are not
aligned with anything in T1 (German) should pro-
vide an indication that, for example, the English text
fragment contains information not present in the cor-
responding German text fragment and subsequently
evidence against the presence of forward entailment.
We there include the feature, A1, that is simply a
count of unaligned words in English T2. In addi-
tion, we hypothesize that the absence of a number
from T2 may be a more significant missing element
of T2 from T1. We therefore include as a feature
the count of tokens comprised of digits in T2 that
are not also present in T1. The final word align-
ment feature attempts to refine A1, by distinguishing
words that are rarely unaligned in German?English
translations. Statistics are computed for every lexi-
cal item from German?English Europarl translations
to produce a lexical unalignment probability, com-
puted for each lexical item based on its relative fre-
quency in the corpus when it is not aligned to any
other word.
The backward classifier uses the same features but
computed for each test pair on counts of unaligned
T1 words.
4 Results
Results for several combinations of features are
shown in Table 1 when the system is trained on
the 500-pair development set training corpus and
tested on the 500-pair held-out development test set
(DEV), in addition to results for feature combina-
tions when trained on the entire 1000-pair develop-
ment data and tested on the held-out 500-pair gold
standard (TEST) (Negri et al, 2011), when the sys-
tem is evaluated as two separate binary forward and
backward classifiers (2-CLASS) as well as the final
evaluation including all four entailment classes (4-
CLASS). The highest accuracy is achieved by the
classifier using the single feature of counts of un-
aligned words, A1, of 34.6%. As two separate bi-
nary classifiers, the alignment features, A1+A2+A3,
achieve a relatively high accuracy of 74.0% for for-
ward with somewhat less accurate for backward
(65.8%) classification (both over the DEV data).
When combined to the final four CLTE classes, how-
ever, accuracy drops significantly to an overall accu-
racy of 50% (also over DEV). A main cause is inac-
curate labeling of no entailment gold standard test
pairs, as the most severe decline is for recall of test
pairs for this label (38.4%).
Accuracy on the development set for the word
alignment features, A1+A2+A3, compared to the
test set shows a sever decline, from 50% to 32%. On
the test data, however, a main cause of inaccuracy
is that backward gold standard test pairs, although
achieving close accuracy to forward when evaluated
as binary classifiers, are inaccurately labeled in the
4-class evaluation, as recall for backward drops to
only 18.4% for this label.
Another insight revealed for the alignment fea-
tures, A1+A2+A3, in the 4-class evaluation is that
when run on the development set, the classes for-
ward and backward achieve significantly higher
f-scores compared to no entailment. However,
the contrary is observed for the test data, as
no entailment achieve higher results than both uni-
directional classes. This appears at first to be a
somewhat counter-intuitive result, but in this case,
the system is simply better at predicting forward and
backward when no entailment exists for a translation
pair compared to when a unidirectional entailment is
present.
4.1 String Similarity Features
In addition to the word alignment features, subse-
quent to submitting results to the shared task, we
have carried out additional experiments using string
similarity features, based on our recent success in
apply string similarity to both the estimation of com-
positionality of MWEs (Salehi and Cook, to appear)
and also the estimation of similarity between short

Table 1: Cross-lingual Textual Entailment Results for Word alignment Features and String Similarity Measures, A1
= count of unaligned words in T2, A2 = count of unaligned numbers in T2, A3 = count of unaligned words in T2
with unaligned probability < 0.11, S1 = Number of matched words in the aligned sequence given by Smith-Waterman
algorithm, S2 = Penalty of aligning sentences using Smith-Waterman algorithm, S3 = Levenshtein distance between
the sentences
135
texts in the *SEM 2013 Shared Task (Gella et al,
to appear). Using the alignments, we replace each
English word with its corresponding word in Ger-
man. The resulting German sentence is compared
with the actual one using string similarity measures.
As the structure of both English and German sen-
tences are usually SVO, we hypothesize that when
there is no entailment between the two given sen-
tences, the newly-made German sentence and the
original German sentence will differ a lot in word
order.
In order to compare the two German sentences,
we use the Levenshtein (Levenshtein, 1966) and the
Smith-Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981) al-
gorithm. The Levenshtein algorithm measures the
number of world-level edits to change one sentence
into another. The edit operators consist of insertion
and deletion. We consider substitution as two edits
(combination of insertion and deletion) based on the
findings of Baldwin (2009).
We also use Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm,
which was originally developed to find the most sim-
ilar region between two proteins. The algorithm
looks for the longest common substring, except that
it permits small numbers of penalized editions con-
sisting of insertion, deletion and substitution. We
call the best found substring the ?SW aligned se-
quence?. In this experiment, we consider the number
of matched words and the number of penalties in the
SW aligned sequence as features.
Results for the string similarity features are shown
in Table 1. Since the string similarity feature scores
do not take the entailment direction into account,
i.e. there is a single set of feature scores for each
text fragment pair as there is no distinction between
forward and backward entailment, and they are not
suited for standalone use in compositional classifica-
tion. We do, however, include these scores in Table
1 to illustrate how with the compositional approach
using the same set of features for forward and back-
ward ultimately results in a classification of test pairs
as either bidirectional or no entailment.
When individual string similarity features are
added to the word alignment features, minor gains in
accuracy are achieved over the word alignment fea-
tures alone, +1% for S1, +0.6% for S2 and +0.8%
for S3 (= Levenstein).
5 Possible Additions: Dictionary Features
We hypothesize that when there is no entailment be-
tween the two sentences, the aligner may not accu-
rately align words. An on-line dictionary contain-
ing lemmatized words, such as Panlex (Baldwin and
Colowick, 2010), could be used to avoid errors in
such cases. Dictionary-based feature scores based
on the presence or absence of alignments in the dic-
tionary could then be applied.
6 Conclusions
This paper describes a compositional cross-lingual
approach to CLTE with experiments carried out
for the German-English language pair. Our results
showed that in the first stages of binary classification
as forward and backward, the word alignment fea-
tures alone achieved good accuracy but when com-
bined suffer severely. Accuracy of the approach
using word alignment features could benefit from
a more directional multi-class classification as op-
posed to the compositional approach we used. In
addition, results showed minor increases in accuracy
can be achieved using string similarity measures.
