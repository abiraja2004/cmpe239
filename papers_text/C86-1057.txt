i. Introduction 
The study of text understanding and 
knowlegde extraction has been actively done by many 
researchers. The authors also studied a method of 
structured information extraction from texts without 
a global text analysis. The method is available for 
a comparatively sbort text such as a patent claim 
clause and an abstract of a technical paper. 
This paper describes tile outline of a method 
of knowledge extraction from a longer text which 
needs a global tex analysis. The kinds of texts ~e 
expository texts ~) or explanation texts-'. 
Expository texts described here mean those which 
have various hierarchical headings such as a title, 
a heading of each section and sometimes an abstract. 
In this deEinJtion, most of texts, including 
technical papers reports and newspapers, are 
expository. Texts of this kind disclose the main 
knowledge in a top-down manner and show not only 
the location of an attribute value in a text but 
also severn\[ key points of the content. This 
property of expository texts contrasts with that of 
novels and stories in which an unexpected 
development of the plot is preferred. 
This paper pays attention to such 
characteristics of expository texts and describes a 
method of anal yzing texts by referring to 
information contained in the intersentential 
relations and the headings of texts and then 
extracting requested knowledge such as a summary 
from texts in an efficient way. 
2. Analysis of intersententia\] relations 
Tile global sentential analysis is performed 
by using the information contaJ ned in the 
intersentential relations and the headings of a text 
by a method combining both the bottom-up and the 
top-down manner. Various kinds of intersentential 
re lat ions\ ] \ ]~ve been proposed so far by many 
linguists "--. By referring to these proposals, 
intersentential relations are class\] lied 
tentatively into about 8 items. They are a detail, 
an additional, a parallel, a rephrase, an example, a 
temporal succession, a cansal and a reasoning 
relation as described in the following subsections. 
Detail relations 
If a term t 2 is the topic term J n a sentence 
S 2 and i \ [  I: is a complementary term of the topLc 
term t\] in the preceding sentence $I as shown in 
Expr.(1), S,. is called the detail of ~1" 
S ? (PRE~'  p , K ? t., K,~" t~, K "t .) 
\ ] "  ' 1 l \ ] "  =t  I z "  z r l  " r l  $5: (PRED: p~, K, , , :  t., K ~: t , ,)  (I) Z Z Z\] ~Z rz rZ S " 
3" " ' ' ' '~ ' ' ' "  where  K : t  represents  a pa i r  o f  a ease  labe l  and a 
te rm,  and the  te rm w: i th  a doub le  under l ine  denotes  a 
top ic .  
The sentence level of S I to that of S 2 
depends on the property of the sentence S 3 
following to S 2 and the relation among the terms 
contained in the sentences S 1 S 2 and S.. If the 
sentence S 3 is connected to S 1 more closely than $2, 
for example, if the sentence S 3 has the topic term 
tl of the sentence S\] as the topic, it is 
considered that the principal sentence is S and the 
sentence level of S~ is lower than that of ~.. 
0 z " t n the other hand, if S I is an introductory 
sentence of a term t 2 and the articles related to t 2 
are described in some sentences following to $I, or I :if t~ is the ~,lobal topic of the section, the z sentence S is considered the principal sentence. 
\]'he global 2 topic can be easily identified by 
inspecting the headings of the section the title and 
the like, whatever it :i s an attribute name or an 
attribute value without reading through the whole 
text. 
If the term t 2 in the sentence S. belongs to 
a kind of pronouns such as "in the following ones" 
or "as follows", the sentence S J s set at the same 2 level as that of $I. At the summarization stage, the 
system tries to s~orten the part consisting of S 1 
and S^ by replacing the pronoun t~ in S. by the main g z I content given :in S 2, namely, the main part 
consisting of t . and p . 
\[Example I\] r2 2 
(a) S\]: SGS receives an ordered triple from a user. 
$2: Tile triple's form is category, input-frames, 
conditions on the sentence. 
$3: SGS regards tile ordered triple as a 
goal. 
S O describes; the content of a term "ordered 
triplg" in S\] , and S~ has tile topic term "SGS" in 
S Heine S is the ~e-a\[l of S ,and S is the 
i :  . . ' 2 " " " \] 1 " pr:l  nc l .pa?  sengence. 
(b) S\]: In th:is section, the overview of LFG is 
described. 
$2: LFG is an extension of context free grammar 
an(\] has the following two structures. 
$3: One is a c-structure which represents the 
surface word and phrase configurations, and 
tile other is a f-structure ...... 
S\] is an introductory sentence of a term "LFG" 
which Js the global topic in a section taken from a 
text. S has a kind of pronoun "tile following two 2 . " 
structures whose contents are described Jn S 3. 
Hence, S is tile principal sentence and tile sentence 2 . . . .  level of S_ is the same as that of S^ z " " 
As a sl)ecial case of detail relations, there are 
a rephrase relation and an example relation. These 
intersententJal relations between sentences S t and 
S 2 can be identified by referring to their  
sentent:ial constructions and sentence modifying 
adverbs such as "in other words" and "for example" . 
The principal sentence of them is, in most cases, 
the sentence S 1 Jn an expository text. 
Additional relations 
If the current sentence has the same 
sentential topic t. as that of the preceding \]. 
sentences and describes another attributes or 
241 
functions of the topic, the current sentence is 
called an additional sentence to the preceding 
sentences. The sentential form of the relation is 
S~:~ (PRED:p~,? K.:t.,l =z Krl:tl) 
S : (PRED:p , K.:i., K " ~ (2) 
2The level~ ofJbT~h t~ 't2) sentences S and S 9 are l generally assumed to be the same except-for the case 
that the global topic is put in a predicate part of 
them. It can be also considered that additional 
relations hold among various sentential groups of 
the same \].eve\]. such as chapters sections or 
paragraphs under a global topic contained in a 
title. 
3?~ Other sententJal relations 
There  are other intersentential relations. They 
are roughly classified into a serial and a 
concurrent or an extended parallel relation. 
A serial relation such as a temporal succession 
a caasal or a reasoning relation has tile same 
physical locatioa of focus or the same logical 
object while it has a time shift or a logical 
inference step shift between adjacent sententia\] 
groups .  
A concurrent relation has  the same t:i.me instant 
of the event occurrences or the same stages of 
logical inference while Jt has a distance or a 
spatial positional shift hetween the physical or tile 
logical objects described in the adjacent sentential 
groul)s. 
The level number of a sentence to the adjacent 
sentential groups in these relations is assigned ill 
a similar way to that of the detail or the 
additional relation by referring to the inter- 
sentential relations and the global topics. 
In usual cases, the difference between a 
principal sentence level and the adjacent sentence 
level is usually set within one level. 
As seen in the above, a sentence or a sentential 
group has an intersentential relation to some 
adjacent sentences or sentential groups. The 
intersentential relation between adjacent sentences 
is sinlilar to a relation between adjacent words or 
word groups combined through rewriting rules of a 
sentence. The intersentential relations are  
classified into two classes. One of them Js a 
relation such as a detail relation which holds 
between a principal sentence and the auxiliary or 
modifying sententJal group with a lower level than 
the principal sentence as shown :in Fig.\].(a). The 
other is a juxtaposition relation like an additional 
relation which holds among several coherent 
sentences with the same level in usual as shown in 
FJg.l(b).

In these diagrams a leaf node represents a 
sentence of a text and an intermediate node 
denotes a representative sentence of the direcL 
descendents or the principal parts of them. A name r 
attached to an arc bridging over several branches 
denotes an intersentential relation. 
3__~.Textgnalysis 
An expository text has a title and consists 
242 
of several sections. The title shows tile main 
topics of the text. The heading of each section 
shows local topics of each section and constitutes 
the attributes of the main top:ics. 
Each o f  maJ n sect ions  somet imes  has  ~ln 
in t roductory  remark  fo l lowed by the  main  par t .  The 
content  o f  t i le  main  par t  i s  a lmost  covered  w i th  the  
subf rame predetermined by t i le  head ing  and the  
title. 
The global cohesion of a section is assured 
by a relation J n which each maia part of the section 
shares some items of Lhe same subframe with other 
main parts. 
Based on the above  idea of text con-  
struction, a text anelysJ.s Js (lone after parsing of 
each sentence. First, each pronoun is replaced by 
the antecedent noun word with tile aids of an 
anaphora analysis. Thea, tile interlnediate expressJ on 
of each sentence of the text is transformed into the 
normal form in which each  topic term J s :inherJ ted 
together with a double under\] ined nlark. The 
expressions to be nornla\]ized are object-apposition 
express ions  ~ ob j  ec . t -con lponent  express ions  
pred icate -cause  express i .ons ,  express ions  wh ich ,  have  ~) 
a term consisting of a case label, and others . 
After normalization, the part of top:ics and 
the content of each sentence are first: identified? 
Second, intersentent i a\] relatJ ons between two 
adjacent sentences are identified J ndetermJ r l i s t J ca l -  
l y  based  on the  assumpt ions  of  two c lasses  o f  
intersentential relations i nent Joned in  section 2.  
Th i rd  , t i le ma:ia sentence  i s  ident i f ied  by re fer r ing  
to  t i le  in tersentent ia l  re la t ions  and the  head ing  o \ [  
the  sect ion  under  t i le  main  top ics  o f  t i le t i t le .  The 
lower  \ ]eve \ ]  sentence  :is indented  as  a mod i f ie r  o f  
the  main  sentence .  Somet imes ,  t i le  know\] .edge of  the  
specific field :is required for better understanding 
of the relations among main sententia\] groups and 
various headings of the text. A case :frame of a 
knowledge base for the specific field is provided in 
which each slot is filled with the most general term 
Jn the specific field. Fourth, a subframe name is 
pre f ixed  to  each  nlail\] sent_ent ia l  g roup  by re fer r ing  
to  the  category  o f  the  main  pred icate  te rm o f  t i le 
main  sentence  and the  subf rame des ignated  by the  
head ing  o f  the  sect ion  and the  t i t le  o f  the  text .  
The bas ic  subf rame names are ,  fo r  example ,  FUNCTION, 
COMPOSITION and PROPERTY in  descr ip t : ion  o f  ac t ions  
and phys ica l  ob jec ts .  
As seen in the above, the main work of the 
text analysis is to :identify the main senl:entJal 
groups  and to  ass ign  to  thenl a s taadard  a t t r ibute  
name of a subirame in a specified field. These 
frames and attribute names are used as a key of a 
specific field for efficJ ently storing and 
re t r iev ing  the  knowledge conta ined  in  texts .
