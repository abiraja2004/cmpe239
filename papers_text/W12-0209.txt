Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to compare languages on the basis of par-
allel texts. Instead of using word lists or
abstract grammatical characteristics to infer
(phylogenetic) relationships, we use mul-
tilingual alignments of words in sentences
to establish measures of language similar-
ity. To this end, we introduce a new method
to quickly infer a multilingual alignment of
words, using the co-occurrence of words in
a massively parallel text (MPT) to simulta-
neously align a large number of languages.
The idea is that a simultaneous multilin-
gual alignment yields a more adequate clus-
tering of words across different languages
than the successive analysis of bilingual
alignments. Since the method is computa-
tionally demanding for a larger number of
languages, we reformulate the problem us-
ing sparse matrix calculations. The useful-
ness of the approach is tested on an MPT
that has been extracted from pamphlets of
the Jehova?s Witnesses. Our preliminary
experiments show that this approach can
supplement both the historical and the ty-
pological comparison of languages.
1 Introduction
The application of quantitative methods in histor-
ical linguistics has attracted a lot of attention in
recent years (cf. Steiner et al (2011) for a sur-
vey). Many ideas have been adapted from evolu-
tionary biology and bioinformatics, where similar
problems occur with respect to the genealogical
grouping of species and the multiple alignment
of strings/sequences. One of the main differences
between those areas and attempts to uncover lan-
guage history is the limited amount of suitable
data that can serve as the basis for language com-
parison. A widely used resource are Swadesh lists
or similar collections of translational equivalents
in the form of word lists. Likewise, phylogenetic
methods have been applied using structural char-
acteristics (e.g., Dunn et al (2005)). In this paper,
we propose yet another data source, namely par-
allel texts.
Many analogies have been drawn between the
evolution of species and languages (see, for in-
stance, Pagel (2009) for such a comparison). One
of the central problems is to establish what is the
equivalent of the gene in the reproduction of lan-
guages. Like in evolutionary biology, where gene
sequences in organisms are compared to infer
phylogenetic trees, a comparison of the ?genes?
of language would be most appropriate for a quan-
titative analysis of languages. Yet, Swadesh-
like wordlists or structural characteristics do not
neatly fit into this scheme as they are most likely
not the basis on which languages are replicated.
After all, language is passed on as the expression
of propositions, i.e. sentences, which usually con-
sists of more than single words. Hence, follow-
ing Croft (2000), we assume that the basic unit of
replication is a linguistic structure embodied in a
concrete utterance.
According to this view, strings of DNA in bio-
logical evolution correspond to utterances in lan-
guage evolution. Accordingly, genes (i.e., the
functional elements of a string of DNA) corre-
spond to linguistic structures occurring in those
utterances. Linguistic replicators (the ?genes? of
language) are thus structures in the context of an
utterance. Such replicators are not only the words
as parts of the sentence but also constructions to
express a complex semantic structure, or phonetic
54
realizations of a phoneme, to give just a few ex-
amples.
In this paper, we want to propose an approach
that we consider to be a first step in the direc-
tion of using the structure of utterances as the
basic unit for the comparison of languages. For
this purpose, a multilingual alignment of words in
parallel sentences (as the equivalent of utterances
in parallel texts) is computed, similar to multi-
species alignments of DNA sequences.1 These
alignments are clusters of words from different
languages in the parallel translations of the same
sentence.2
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. First, we quickly review the position of our
approach in relation to the large body of work on
parallel text analysis (Section 2). Then we de-
scribe the method for the multilingual alignment
of words (Section 3). Since the number of lan-
guages and sentences that have to be analyzed re-
quire a lot of computationally expensive calcula-
tions of co-occurrence counts, the whole analysis
is reformulated into manipulations of sparse ma-
trices. The various steps are presented in detail
to give a better overview of the calculations that
are needed to infer the similarities. Subsequently,
we give a short description of the material that we
used in order to test our method (Section 4). In
Section 5 we report on some of the experiments
that we carried out, followed by a discussion of
the results and their implications. Finally, we con-
clude with directions for future work in this area.
2 Word Alignment
Alignment of words using parallel texts has been
widely applied in the field of statistical ma-
chine translation (cf. Koehn (2010)). Alignment
methods have largely been employed for bitexts,
i.e., parallel texts of two languages (Tiedemann,
2011). In a multilingual context, the same meth-
ods could in principle be used for each pair of lan-
guages in the sample. One of the goals of this pa-
1The choice of translational equivalents in the form of
sentences rather than words accounts for the fact that some
words cannot be translated accurately between some lan-
guages whereas most sentences can.
2In practice, we simply use wordforms as separated by
spaces or punctuation instead of any more linguistically sen-
sible notion of ?word?. For better performance, more detailed
language-specific analysis is necessary, like morpheme sep-
aration, or the recognition of multi-word expressions and
phrase structures.
per, however, is to investigate what can be gained
when including additional languages in the align-
ment process at the same time and not iteratively
looking for correspondences in pairs of languages
(see Simard (1999), Simard (2000) for a similar
approach).
There are basically two approaches to comput-
ing word alignments as discussed in the literature
(cf. Och and Ney (2003)): (i) statistical alignment
models and (ii) heuristic models. The former have
traditionally been used for the training of parame-
ters in statistical machine translation and are char-
acterized by their high complexity, which makes
them difficult to implement and tune. The latter
are considerably simpler and thus easier to im-
plement as they only require a function for the
association of words, which is computed from
their co-occurrence counts. A wide variety of co-
occurrence measures have been employed in the
literature. We decided to use a heuristic method
for the first steps reported on here, but plan to inte-
grate statistical alignment models for future work.
Using a global co-occurrence measure, we pur-
sue an approach in which the words are compared
for each sentence individually, but for all lan-
guages at the same time. That is, a co-occurrence
matrix is created for each sentence, containing all
the words of all languages that occur in the cor-
responding translational equivalents for that sen-
tence. This matrix then serves as the input for
a partitioning algorithm whose results are inter-
preted as a partial alignment of the sentence. In
most cases, the resulting alignments do not in-
clude words from all languages. Only those words
that are close translational equivalents occur in
alignments. This behavior, while not optimal
for machine translation, is highly useful for lan-
guage comparison because differences between
languages are implicitly marked as such by split-
ting different structures into separate alignments.
The languages are then compared on the basis
of having words in the same clusters with other
languages. The more word forms they share in the
same clusters, the more similar the languages are
considered to be.3 The form of the words them-
selves is thereby of no importance. What counts
3A related approach is discussed in Wa?lchli (2011). The
biggest difference to the present approach is that Wa?lchli
only compares languages pairwise. In addition, he makes use
of a global glossing method and not an alignment of words
within the same parallel sentence.
55
is their frequency of co-occurrence in alignments
across languages. This is in stark contrast to
methods which focus on the form of words with
similar meanings (e.g., using Swadesh lists) in or-
der to compute some kind of language similar-
ity. One major disadvantage of the present ap-
proach for a comparison of languages from a his-
torical perspective is the fact that such similarities
also could be a consequence of language contact.
This is a side effect that is shared by the word
list approach, in which loanwords have a simi-
lar effect on the results. It has to be seen how
strongly this influences the final results in order
to assess whether our current approach is useful
for the quantitative analysis of genealogical relat-
edness.
3 Method
We start from a massively parallel text, which we
consider as an n?m matrix consisting of n differ-
ent parallel sentences S = {S1, S2, S3, ..., Sn} in
m different languages L = {L1, L2, L3, ..., Lm}.
This data-matrix is called SL (?sentences ? lan-
guages?). We assume here that the parallel sen-
tences are short enough so that most words occur
only once per sentence. Because of this assump-
tion we can ignore the problem of decoding the
correct alignment of multiple occurring words, a
problem we leave to be tackled in future research.
We also ignore the complications of language-
specific chunking and simply take spaces and
punctuation marks to provide a word-based sep-
aration of the sentences into parts. In future re-
search we are planning to include the (language-
specific) recognition of bound morphemes, multi-
word expressions and phrase structures to allow
for more precise cross-language alignment.
Based on these assumptions, we decompose the
SL matrix into two sparse matrices WS (?words
? sentences?) and WL (?words ? languages?)
based on all words w that occur across all lan-
guages in the parallel texts. We define them as
follows. First, WSij = 1 when word wi oc-
curs in sentence Sj , and is 0 elsewhere. Second,
WLij = 1 when word wi is a word of language
Lj , and is 0 elsewhere. The product WST ?WL
then results in a matrix of the same size as SL,
listing in each cell the number of different words
in each sentence. Instead of the current approach
of using WS only for marking the occurrence of
a word in a sentence (i.e., a ?bag of words? ap-
proach), it is also possible to include the order of
words in the sentences by defining WSij = k
when word wi occurs in position k in sentence
Sj . We will not use this extension in this paper.
The matrix WS will be used to compute co-
occurrence statistics of all pairs of words, both
within and across languages. Basically, we define
O (?observed co-occurrences?) and E (?expected
co-occurrences?) as:
O = WS ?WST
E = WS ?
1SS
n
?WST
Eij thereby gives the expected number of sen-
tences where wi and wj occur in the correspond-
ing translational equivalents, on the assumption
that words from different languages are statisti-
cally independent of each other and occur at ran-
dom in the translational equivalents. Note that
the symbol ?1ab? in our matrix multiplications
refers to a matrix of size a ? b consisting of
only 1?s. Widespread co-occurrence measures are
pointwise mutual information, which under these
definitions simply is logE? logO, or the cosine
similarity, which would be O?
n?E
. However, we
assume that the co-occurrence of words follow
a poisson process (Quasthoff and Wolff, 2002),
which leads us to define the co-occurrence matrix
WW (?words ? words?) using a poisson distri-
bution as:
WW = ? log[
EO exp(?E)
O!
]
= E+ logO!?O logE
This WW matrix represents a similarity ma-
trix of words based on their co-occurrence in
translational equivalents for the respective lan-
guage pair. Using the alignment clustering that
is based on the WW matrices for each sentence,
we then decompose the words-by-sentences ma-
trix WS into two sparse matrices WA (?words?
alignments?) and AS (?alignments ? sentences?)
such that WS = WA ?AS. This decomposition
is the basic innovation of the current paper.
The idea is to compute concrete alignments
from the statistical alignments in WW for each
sentence separately, but for all languages at the
same time. For each sentence Si we take the
subset of the similarity matrix WW only includ-
ing those words that occur in the column WSi,
56
i.e., only those words that occur in sentence Si.
We then perform a partitioning on this subset of
the similarity matrix WW. In this paper we use
the affinity propagation clustering approach from
Frey and Dueck (2007) to identify the clusters, but
this is mainly a practical choice and other meth-
ods could be used here as well. The reason for
this choice is that this clustering does not require
a pre-defined number of clusters, but establishes
the optimal number of clusters together with the
clustering itself.4 In addition, it yields an exem-
plar for each cluster, which is the most typical
member of the cluster. This enables an inspec-
tion of intermediate results of what the clusters
actually contain. The resulting clustering for each
sentence identifies groups of words that are sim-
ilar to each other, which represent words that are
to be aligned across languages. Note that we do
not force such clusters to include words from all
languages, nor do we force any restrictions on the
number of words per language in each cluster.5
In practice, most alignments only include words
from a small number of the languages included.
To give a concrete example for the clustering
results, consider the English sentence given below
(no. 93 in our corpus, see next section) together
with its translational equivalents in German, Bul-
garian, Spanish, Maltese and Ewe (without punc-
tuation and capitalization).
i. who will rule with jesus (English, en)
ii. wer wird mit jesus regieren (German, de)
iii. ko$i we upravlva s isus (Bulgarian, bl)
iv. quie?nes gobernara?n con jesu?s (Spanish, es)
v. min se jah?kem ma g?esu` (Maltese, mt)
vi. amekawoe a?u fia kple yesu (Ewe, ew)
These six languages are only a subset of the
50 languages that served as input for the matrix
WW where all words that occur in the respective
sentence for all 50 languages are listed together
with their co-occurrence significance. When re-
stricting the output of the clustering to those
words that occur in the six languages given above,
4Instead of a prespecified number of clusters, affinity
propagation in fact takes a real number as input for each data
point where data points with larger values are more likely to
be chosen as exemplars. If no input preference is given for
each data point, as we did in our experiments, exemplar pref-
erences are initialized as the median of non infinity values in
the input matrix.
5Again, this takes into account that some words cannot
be translated accurately between some languages.
however, the following clustering result is ob-
tained:
1. isusbl jesusen fiaew yesuew g?esu`mt jesu?ses
jesusde
2. ko$ibl whoen minmt werde
3. regierende
4. upravlvabl a?uew jah?kemmt gobernara?nes
5. amekawoeew quie?neses
6. webl willen semtwirdde
7. sbl withen cones mitde
8. kpleew
9. mamt
10. ruleen
First note that the algorithm does not require
all languages to be given in the same script. Bul-
garian isus is grouped together with its transla-
tional equivalents in cluster 1 even though it does
not share any grapheme with them. Rather, words
from different languages end up in the same clus-
ter if they behave similarly across languages in
terms of their co-occurrence frequency. Further,
note that the ?question word? clusters 2 and 5 dif-
fer in their behavior as will be discussed in more
detail in Section 5.2. Also note that the English
?rule? and German ?regieren? are not included in
the cluster 4 with similar translations in the other
languages. This turns out to be a side effect of the
very low frequency of these words in the current
corpus.
In the following, we will refer to these clusters
of words as alignments (many-to-many mappings
between words) within the same sentence across
languages. For instance, sentences i., iii. and v.
above would have the following alignment, where
indices mark those words that are aligned by the
alignment clusters (1.-10.) above:
who2 will6 rule10 with7 jesus1
min2 se6 jah?kem4 ma7 g?esu`1
ko$i2 we6 upravlva4 s7 isus1
All alignment-clusters from all sentences are
summarized as columns in the sparse matrixWA,
defined as WAij = 1 when word wi is part of
alignment Aj , and is 0 elsewhere.6 We also estab-
lish the ?book-keeping? matrix AS to keep track
6For instance, the alignment in 2. above contains the four
words {ko$i, who, min, wer}, which are thus marked with 1
whereas all other words have 0 in this column of the WA
matrix.
57
of which alignment belongs to which sentence,
defined as ASij = 1 when the alignment Ai oc-
curs in sentence Sj , and as 0 elsewhere. The
alignment matrix WA is the basic information
to be used for language comparison. For exam-
ple, the product WA ?WAT represents a sparse
version of the words ? words similarity matrix
WW.
A more interesting usage of WA is to derive
a similarity between the alignments AA. We de-
fine both a sparse version of AA, based on the
number of words that co-occur in a pair of align-
ments, and a statistical version of AA, based on
the average similarity between the words in the
two alignments:
AAsparse = WAT ?WA
AAstatistical =
WAT ?WW ?WA
WAT ? 1WW ?WA
The AA matrices will be used to select suit-
able alignments from the parallel texts to be used
for language comparison. Basically, the statistical
AA will be used to identify similar alignments
within a single sentence and the sparse AA will
be used to identify similar alignments across dif-
ferent sentences. Using a suitable selection of
alignments (we here use the notation A? for a se-
lection of alignments7), a similarity between lan-
guages LL can be defined as:
LL = LA? ? LA?T
by defining LA? (?languages ? alignments?) as
the number of words per language that occur in
each selected alignment:
LA? = WLT ?WA?
The similarity between two languages LL is then
basically defined as the number of times words
are attested in the selected alignments for both
languages. It thus gives an overview of how
structurally similar two languages are, where lan-
guages are considered to have a more similar
structure the more words they share in the align-
ment clusters.
7Note that the prime in this case does not stand for the
transpose of a matrix, as it is sometimes used.
4 Data
Parallel corpora have received a lot of attention
since the advent of statistical machine translation
(Brown et al, 1988) where they serve as training
material for the underlying alignment models. For
this reason, the last two decades have seen an in-
creasing interest in the collection of parallel cor-
pora for a number of language pairs (Hansard8),
also including text corpora which contain texts
in three or more languages (OPUS9, Europarl10,
Multext-East11). Yet there are only few resources
which comprise texts for which translations are
available into many different languages. Such
texts are here referred to as ?massively parallel
texts? (MPT; cf. Cysouw and Wa?lchli (2007)).
The most well-known MPT is the Bible, which
has a long tradition in being used as the basis
for language comparison. Apart from that, other
religious texts are also available online and can
be used as MPTs. One of them is a collection
of pamphlets of the Jehova?s Witnesses, some of
which are available for over 250 languages.
In order to test our methods on a variety of
languages, we collected a number of pamphlets
from the Watchtower website http://www.
watchtower.org) together with their trans-
lational equivalents for 146 languages in total.
The texts needed some preprocessing to remove
HTML markup, and they were aligned with re-
spect to the paragraphs according to the HTML
markup. We extracted all paragraphs which con-
sisted of only one sentence in the English ver-
sion and contained exactly one English question
word (how, who, where, what, why, whom, whose,
when, which) and a question mark at the end.
From these we manually excluded all sentences
where the ?question word? is used with a differ-
ent function (e.g., where who is a relative pronoun
rather than a question word). In the end we were
left with 252 questions in the English version and
the corresponding sentences in the 145 other lan-
guages. Note that an English interrogative sen-
tence is not necessarily translated as a question
in each other language (e.g., the English question
what is the truth about God? is simply translated
into German as die Wahrheit u?ber Gott ?the truth

about God?). However, such translations appear
to be exceptions.
5 Experiments
5.1 Global comparison of Indo-European
As a first step to show that our method yields
promising results we ran the method for the 27
Indo-European languages in our sample in order
to see what kind of global language similarity
arises when using the present approach. In our
procedure, each sentence is separated into various
multilingual alignments. Because the structures
of languages are different, not each alignment will
span across all languages. Most alignments will
be ?sparse?, i.e., they will only include words from
a subset of all languages included. In total, we
obtained 6, 660 alignments (i.e., 26.4 alignments
per sentence on average), with each alignment in-
cluding on average 9.36 words. The number of
alignments per sentence turns out to be linearly
related to the average number of words per sen-
tence, as shown in Fig. 1. A linear interpolation
results in a slope of 2.85, i.e., there are about three
times as many alignments per sentence as the av-
erage number of words. We expect that this slope
depends on the number of languages that are in-
cluded in the analysis: the more languages, the
steeper the slope.

We use the LL matrix as the similarity matrix
for languages including all 6, 660 alignments. For
each language pair this matrix contains the num-
ber of times words from both languages are at-
tested in the same alignment. This similarity ma-
trix is converted into a distance matrix by sub-
tracting the similarity value from the highest value
that occurs in the matrix:
LLdist = max(LL)? LL
This distance matrixLLdist is transformed into
a NeighborNet visualization for an inspection of
the structures that are latent in the distance ma-
trix. The NeighborNet in Fig. 2 reveals an ap-
proximate grouping of languages according to the
major language families, the Germanic family on
the right, the Romance family on the top and the
Slavic family at the bottom. Note that the sole
Celtic language in our sample, Welsh, is included
inside the Germanic languages, closest to English.
This might be caused by horizontal influence from
English on Welsh. Further, the only Baltic lan-
guage in our sample, Lithuanian, is grouped with
the Slavic languages (which is phylogenetically
expected behavior in line with Gray and Atkin-
son (2003)), though note that it is grouped par-
ticularly close to Russian and Polish, which sug-
gests more recent horizontal transfer. Interest-
ingly, the separate languages Albanian and Greek
roughly group together with two languages from
the other families: Romanian (Romance) and Bul-
garian (Slavic). This result is not in line with their
phylogenetic relatedness but rather reflects a con-
tact situation in which all four languages are part
of the Balkan Sprachbund.
Although the NeighborNet visualization ex-
hibits certain outcomes that do not correspond to
the attested genealogical relationship of the lan-
guages, the method still fares pretty well based
on a visual inspection of the resulting Neighbor-
Net. In the divergent cases, the groupings can be
explained by the fact that the languages are in-
fluenced by the surrounding languages (as is most
clear for the Balkan languages) through direct lan-
guage contact. As mentioned before, a similar
problem also exists when using word lists to in-
fer phylogenetic trees when loanwords introduce
noise into the calculations and thus lead to a closer
relationship of languages than is genealogically
tenable. However, in the case of our alignments

the influence of language contact is not related to
loanwords but to the borrowing of similar con-
structions or structural features. In the Balkan
case, linguists have noted over one hundred such
shared structural features, among them the loss
of the infinitive, syncretism of dative and geni-
tive case and postposed articles (cf. Joseph (1992)
and references therein). These features are partic-
ularly prone to lead to a higher similarity in our
approach where the alignment of words within
sentences is sensitive to the fact that certain word
forms are identical or different even though the
exact form of the word is not relevant.
5.2 Typology of PERSON interrogatives
A second experiment we conducted involved a
closer study of just a few questions in the data at
hand to obtain a better impression of the results
of the alignment procedure. For this experiment,
we took the same 252 questions for a worldwide
sample of 50 languages. After running the whole
procedure, we selected just the six sentences in
the sample that were formulated in English with a
who interrogative, i.e., questions as to the person
who did something. The English sentences are the
following:
I Who will be resurrected?
II Who will rule with Jesus?
III Who created all living things?
IV Who are god?s true worshipers on earth to-
day?
V Who is Jesus Christ?
VI Who is Michael the Archangel?
We expected to be able to find all translations
of English who in the alignments. Interestingly,
this is not what happened. The six alignments that
comprised the English who only included words
in 23 to 30 other languages in the sample, so we
are clearly not finding all translations of who. By
using a clustering on AAstatistical we were able
to find seven more alignments that appear to be
highly similar to the six alignments including En-
glish who. Together, these 13 alignments included
words for almost all languages in the six sentences
(on average 47.7 words for each sentence). We
computed a language similarity LL only on the
basis of these 13 alignments, which represents a
typology of the structure of PERSON interrog-
atives. This typology clearly separates into two
60
clusters of languages, two ?types? so to speak, as
can be seen in Fig. 3.
Investigating the reason for these two types, it
turns out that the languages in the right cluster of
Fig. 3 consistently separate the six sentences into
two groups. The first, second, and fourth sen-
tence are differently marked than the third, fifth
and sixth sentence. For example, Finnish uses
ketka? vs. kuka and Spanish quie?nes vs. quie?n.
These are both oppositions in number, suggesting
that all languages in the right cluster of Fig. 3 dis-
tinguish between a singular and a plural form of
who. Interpreting the meaning of the English sen-
tences quoted above, this distinction makes com-
plete sense. The Ewe form amekawoe in example
vi. (see Section 3) contains the plural marker -wo,
which distinguishes it from the singular form and
indeed correctly clusters together with quie?nes in
the alignment cluster 5.
This example shows that it is possible to use
parallel texts to derive a typology of languages for
a highly specific characteristic.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
One major problem with using our approach for
phylogentic reconstruction is the influence of lan-
guage contact. Traits of the languages which are
not inherited from a common proto-language but
are transmitted through contact situations lead to
noise in the similarity matrix which does not re-
flect a genealogical signal. However, other meth-
ods also suffer from the shortcoming that lan-
guage contact cannot be automatically subtracted
from the comparison of languages without man-
ual input (such as manually created cognate lists).
With translational equivalents, a further problem
for the present approach is the influence of trans-
lationese on the results. If one version in a lan-
guage is a direct translation of another language,
the structural similarity might get a higher score
due to the fact that constructions will be literally
translated which otherwise would be expressed
differently in that language.
The experiments that have been presented in
this paper are only a first step. However, we firmly
believe that a multilingual alignment of words is
more appropriate for a large-scale comparison of
languages than an iterative bilingual alignment.
Yet so far we do not have the appropriate evalu-
ation method to prove this. We therefore plan to
include a validation scheme in order to test how
much can be gained from the simultaneous analy-
sis of more than two languages. Apart from this,
we intend to improve the alignment method itself
by integrating techniques from statistical align-
ment models, like adding morpheme separation or
phrase structures into the analysis.
Another central problem for the further devel-
opment of this method is the selection of align-
ments for the language comparison. As our sec-
ond experiment showed, just starting from a se-
lection of English words will not automatically
generate the corresponding words in the other lan-
guages. It is possible to use the AA matrices to
search for further similar alignments, but this pro-
cedure is not yet formalized enough to automati-
cally produce language classification for selected
linguistic domains (like for the PERSON interrog-
atives in our experiment). When this step is better
understood, we will be able to automatically gen-
erate typological parameters for a large number
of the world?s languages, and thus easily produce
more data on which to base future language com-
parison.
