Abstract
The use of automatic word alignment to
capture sentence-level semantic relations
is common to a number of cross-lingual
NLP applications. Despite its proved
usefulness, however, word alignment in-
formation is typically considered from a
quantitative point of view (e.g. the number
of alignments), disregarding qualitative
aspects (the importance of aligned terms).
In this paper we demonstrate that integrat-
ing qualitative information can bring sig-
nificant performance improvements with
negligible impact on system complexity.
Focusing on the cross-lingual textual en-
tailment task, we contribute with a novel
method that: i) significantly outperforms
the state of the art, and ii) is portable, with
limited loss in performance, to language
pairs where training data are not available.
1 Introduction
Meaning representation, comparison and projec-
tion across sentences are major challenges for a
variety of cross-lingual applications. So far, de-
spite the relevance of the problem, research on
multilingual applications has either circumvented
the issue, or proposed partial solutions.
When possible, the typical approach builds on
the reduction to a monolingual task, burdening the
process with dependencies from machine transla-
tion (MT) components. For instance, in cross-
lingual question answering and cross-lingual tex-
tual entailment (CLTE), intermediate MT steps
are respectively performed to ease answer re-
trieval/presentation (Parton, 2012; Tanev et al,
2006) and semantic inference (Mehdad et al,
2010). Direct solutions that avoid such pivot-
ing strategies typically exploit similarity measures
that rely on bag-of-words representations. As an
example, most supervised approaches to MT qual-
ity estimation (Blatz et al, 2003; Callison-Burch
et al, 2012) and CLTE (Wa?schle and Fendrich,
2012) include features that consider the amount of
equivalent terms that are found in the input sen-
tence pairs. Such simplification, however, disre-
gards the fact that semantic equivalence is not only
proportional to the number of equivalent terms,
but also to their importance. In other words, in-
stead of checking what of a given sentence can be
found in the other, current approaches limit the
analysis to the amount of lexical elements they
share, under the rough assumption that the more
the better.
In this paper we argue that:
(1) Considering qualitative aspects of word align-
ments to identify sentence-level semantic relations
can bring significant performance improvements
in cross-lingual NLP tasks.
(2) Shallow linguistic processing techniques (of-
ten a constraint in real cross-lingual scenarios due
to limited resources availability) can be leveraged
to set up portable solutions that still outperform
current bag-of-words methods.
To support our claims we experiment with the
CLTE task, which allows us to perform exhaus-
tive comparative experiments due to the availabil-
ity of comparable benchmarks for different lan-
guage pairs. In the remainder of the paper, we:
(1) Prove the effectiveness of our method over
datasets for four language combinations;
(2) Assess the portability of our models across lan-
guages in different testing conditions.
2 Objectives and Method
We propose a supervised learning approach for
identifying and classifying semantic relations be-
tween two sentences T1 and T2 written in different
languages. Beyond semantic equivalence, which
is relevant to applications such as MT quality es-

timation (Mehdad et al, 2012b),1 we aim to cap-
ture a richer set of relations potentially relevant to
other tasks. For instance, recognizing unrelated-
ness, forward and backward entailment relations,
represents a core problem in cross-lingual docu-
ment summarization (Lenci et al, 2002) and con-
tent synchronization (Monz et al, 2011; Mehdad
et al, 2012a). CLTE, as proposed within the Se-
mEval evaluation exercises (Negri et al, 2012;
Negri et al, 2013), represents an ideal framework
to evaluate such capabilities. Within this frame-
work, our goal is to automatically identify the fol-
lowing entailment relations between T1 and T2:
forward (T1 ? T2), backward (T1 ? T2), bidi-
rectional (T1 ? T2) and no entailment.
Our approach (see Figure 1) involves two core
components: i) a word alignment model, and ii) a
CLTE classifier. The former is trained on a par-
allel corpus, and associates equivalent terms in T1
and T2. The information about word alignments
is used to extract quantitative (amount and dis-
tribution of the alignments) and qualitative fea-
tures (importance of the aligned terms) to train the
CLTE classifier. Although in principle both com-
ponents need training data (respectively a paral-
lel corpus and labeled CLTE data), our goal is to
develop a method that is also portable across lan-
guages. To this aim, while the parallel corpus is
necessary to train the word aligner for any lan-
guage pair we want to deal with, the CLTE clas-
1A translation has to be semantically equivalent to the
source sentence.
sifier can be designed to learn from features that
capture language independent knowledge.2 This
allows us to experiment in different testing con-
ditions, namely: i) when CLTE training data are
available for a given language pair (Figure 1a),
and ii) when CLTE training data are missing, and
a model trained on other language pairs has to be
reused (Figure 1b-c).
Features. Considering word alignment informa-
tion, we extract three different groups of features:
AL, POS, and IDF.
The AL group provides quantitative informa-
tion about the aligned/unaligned words in each
sentence T? of the pair. These features are:
1. proportion of aligned words in T?. We use
this indicator as our baseline (B henceforth);
2. number of sequences of unaligned words,
normalized by the length of T?;
3. length of the longest a) sequence of aligned
words, and b) sequence of unaligned words,
both normalized by the length of T?;
4. average length of a) the aligned word se-
quences, and b) the unaligned word se-
quences;
5. position of a) the first unaligned word, and
b) the last unaligned word, both normalized
by the lenght of T?;
6. proportion of word n-grams in T? contain-
ing only aligned words (the feature was com-
2For instance, the fact that aligning all nouns and the most
relevant terms in T1 and T2 is a good indicator of semantic
equivalence.
772
puted separately for values of n = 1 . . . 5).
The POS group considers the part of speech
(PoS) of the words in T? as a source of qualitative
information about their importance. To compute
these features we use the TreeTagger (Schmid,
1995), manually mapping the fine-grained set of
assigned PoS labels into a more general set of tags
(P ) based on the universal PoS tag set by Petrov
et al (2012). POS features differentiate between
aligned words (words in T1 that are aligned to one
or more words in T2) and alignments (the edges
connecting words in T1 and T2). Features consid-
ering the aligned words in T? are:
7. for each PoS tag p ? P , proportion of aligned
words in T? tagged with p;
8. proportion of words in T1 aligned with words
with the same PoS tag in T2 (and vice-versa);
9. for each PoS tag p ? P , proportion of words
in T1 tagged as p which are aligned to words
with the same tag in T2 (and vice-versa).
Features considering the alignments are:
10. proportion of alignments connecting words
with the same PoS tag p;
11. for each PoS tag p ? P , proportion of align-
ments connecting two words tagged as p.
IDF, the last feature, uses the inverse docu-
ment frequency (Salton and Buckley, 1988) as an-
other source of qualitative information under the
assumption that rare words (and, therefore, with
higher IDF) are more informative:
12. summation of all the IDF scores of the
aligned words in T? over the summation of
the IDF scores of all words in T?.
3 Experiments
Our experiments cover two different scenarios.
First, the typical one, in which the CLTE model
is trained on labeled data for the same pair of lan-
guages L1?L2 of the test set. Then, simulating
the less favorable situation in which labeled train-
ing data for L1?L2 are missing, we investigate the
possibility to use existing CLTE models trained on
labeled data for a different language pair L3?L4.
The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our
experiments are available for four language pairs:
Es?En, De?En, Fr?En, and It?En. Each dataset
was created with the crowdsourcing-based method
described in Negri et al (2011), and consists of
1000 T1?T2 pairs (500 for training, 500 for test).
To train the word alignment models we used
the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005), con-
catenated with the News Commentary corpus3
for three language pairs: De?En (2,079,049
sentences), Es?En (2,123,036 sentences), Fr?En
(2,144,820 sentences). For It?En we only used
the parallel data available in Europarl (1,909,115
sentences) since this language pair is not covered
by the News Commentary corpus. IDF values for
the words in each language were calculated on the
monolingual part of these corpora, using the aver-
age IDF value of each language for unseen terms.
To build the word alignment models we used the
MGIZA++ package (Gao and Vogel, 2008). Ex-
periments have been carried out with the hidden
Markov model (HMM) (Vogel et al, 1996) and
IBM models 3 and 4 (Brown et al, 1993).4 We also
explored three symmetrization techniques (Koehn
et al, 2005): union, intersection, and grow-diag-
final-and. A greedy feature selection process on
training data, with different combinations of word
alignment models and symmetrization methods,
indicated HMM/intersection as the best perform-
ing combination. For this reason, all our experi-
ments use this setting.
The SVM implementation of Weka (Hall et
al., 2009) was used to build the CLTE model.5
Two binary classifiers were trained to separately
check T1 ? T2 and T1 ? T2, merging
their output to obtain the 4-class judgments (e.g.
yes/yes=bidirectional, yes/no=forward).
3.1 Evaluation with CLTE training data
Figure 2 shows the accuracy obtained by the dif-
ferent feature groups.6 For the sake of compari-
son, state-of-the-art results achieved for each lan-
guage combination at SemEval 2012 are also re-
ported. As regards Es?En (63.2% accuracy) and
De?En (55.8%), the top scores were obtained by
the system described in (Wa?schle and Fendrich,
2012), where a combination of binary classifiers
for each entailment direction is trained with a mix-

4Five iterations of HMM, and three iterations of IBM
models 3 and 4 have been performed on the training corpora.

ture of monolingual (i.e. with the input sentences
translated in the same language using Google
Translate7) and cross-lingual features. Although
such system exploits word-alignment information
to some extent, this is only done at quantitative
level (e.g. number of unaligned words, percentage
of aligned words, length of the longest unaligned
subsequence). As regards It?En, the state of the
art (56.6%) is represented by the system described
in (Jimenez et al, 2012), which uses a pure pivot-
ing method (using Google Translate) and adaptive
similarity functions based on ?soft? cardinality for
flexible term comparisons. The two systems ob-
tained the same result on Fr?En (57.0%).

Figure 2: Accuracy obtained by each feature
group on four language combinations.
As can be seen in Figure 2, the combination of
all our features outperforms the state of the art
for each language pair. The accuracy improve-
ment ranges from 6.6% for Es?En (from 63.2% to
67.4%) to 14.6% for De?En (from 55.8% to 64%).
Except for Es?En, that has very competitive state-
of-the-art results, the combination of AL with POS
or IDF feature groups always outperforms the best
systems. Furthermore, the performance increase
with qualitative features (POS and IDF) shows co-
herent trends across all language pairs. It is worth
noting that, while we rely on a pure cross-lingual
approach, both the state-of-the-art CLTE systems
include features from the translation of T1 into the
language of T2. For De?En, quantitative features
alone achieve lower results compared to the other
languages. This can be motivated by the higher
difficulty in aligning De?En pairs (this hypothesis
is supported by the fact that the average number
of alignments per sentence pair is 18 for De?En,
and >22 for the other combinations). Neverthe-
less, qualitative features lead to results comparable
7http://translate.google.com/
with the other language pairs.
The selection of the best performing features
for each language pair produces further improve-
ments of varying degrees in Es?En (from 67.4%
to 68%), De?En (64% ? 64.8%) and It?En (63.4%
? 66.8%), while performance remains stable for
Fr?En (63%). All these configurations include
the IDF feature (12) and the proportion of aligned
words for each PoS category (7), proving the ef-
fectiveness of qualitative word alignment features.
The fact that HMM/intersection is the best com-
bination of alignment model and symmetrization
method is interesting, since it contradicts the gen-
eral notion that IBM models 3 and 4 perform bet-
ter than HMM (Och and Ney, 2003). A possible
explanation is that, while word alignment models
are usually trained on parallel corpora, the major-
ity of CLTE sentence pairs are not parallel. In
this setting, where producing reliable alignments
is more difficult, IBM models are less effective for
at least two reasons. First, including a word fertil-
ity model, IBM 3 and 4 limit (typically to the half
of the source sentence length) the number of tar-
get words that can be aligned with the null word.
Therefore, when such limit is reached, these mod-
els tend to force low probability, hence less reli-
able, word alignments. Second, in IBM model 4,
the larger distortion limit makes it possible to align
distant words. In the case of non-parallel sen-
tences, this often results in wrong or noisy align-
ments that affect final results. For these reasons,
CLTE data seem more suitable for the simpler and
more conservative HMM model, and a precision-
oriented symmetrization method like intersection.
3.2 Evaluation without CLTE training data
The goal of our second round of experiments is to
investigate if, and to what extent, our approach can
be considered as language-independent. Confirm-
ing this would allow to reuse models trained for
a given language pair in situations where CLTE
training data is missing. This is a rather realistic
situation since, while bitexts to train word aligners
are easier to find, the availability of labeled CLTE
data is far from being guaranteed.
Our experiments have been carried out, over the
same SemEval datasets, with two methods that do
not use labeled data for the target language com-
bination. The first one (method b in Figure 1)
uses a CLTE model trained for a language pair
L1?L2 for which labeled training data are avail-
774
able, and applies this model to a language pair
L3?L4 for which only parallel corpora are avail-
able. The second method (c in Figure 1) addresses
the same problem, but exploits a combination of
CLTE models trained for different language pairs.
For each test set, the models trained for the other
three language pairs are used in a voting scheme,
in order to check whether they can complement
each other to increase final results.
All the experiments have been performed using
the best CLTE model for each language pair, com-
paring results with those presented in Section 3.1.

Figure 3: Accuracy obtained by reusing CLTE
models (alone and in a voting scheme).
As shown in Figure 3, reusing models for a new
language pair leads to results that still outperform
the state of the art.6 Remarkably, when used for
other language combinations, the Es?En, It?En,
and Fr?En models always lead to results above,
or equal to the state of the art. For similar lan-
guages such as Spanish, French, and Italian, the
accuracy increase over the state of the art is up to
14.8% (from 56.6% to 65.0%) and 13.4% (from
56.6% to 64.2%) when the Fr?En and Es?En mod-
els are respectively used to label the It?En dataset.
Although not always statistically significant and
below the performance obtained in the ideal sce-
nario where CLTE training data are available (full
sys.), such improvements suggest that our features
can be re-used, at least to some extent, across dif-
ferent language settings. As expected, the major
incompatibilities arise between German and the
other languages due to the linguistic differences
between this language and the others. However, it
is interesting to note that: i) at least in one case
(i.e. when tested on It?En) the De?En model still
achieves results above the state of the art, and ii)
on the De?En evaluation setting the worst model
(Fr?En) still achieves state of the art results.
The results obtained with the voting scheme
suggest that our models can complement each
other when used on a new language pair. Although
statistically significant only over It?En data, vot-
ing results both outperform the state of the art and
the results achieved by single models.
4 Conclusion
We investigated the usefulness of qualitative infor-
mation from automatic word alignment to iden-
tify semantic relations between sentences in dif-
ferent languages. With coherent results in CLTE,
we demonstrated that features considering the im-
portance of aligned terms can successfully inte-
grate the quantitative evidence (number and pro-
portion of aligned terms) used by previous su-
pervised learning approaches. A study on the
portability across languages of the learned mod-
els demonstrated that word alignment information
can be exploited to train reusable models for new
language combinations where bitexts are available
but CLTE labeled data are not.
