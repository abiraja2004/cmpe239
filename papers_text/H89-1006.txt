The primary goal of this work is to develop improved methods and models for acoustic recog- 
nition of continuous peech. Most of the work has focused on deriving statistical models for speech 
recognition that can capture the acoustic-phonetic phenomena that occur in speech with the con- 
straint that the models can be adequately estimated from a reasonable amount of training speech. 
Most of our work in phonetic recognition and word recognition over the past six years has 
involved hidden Markov models (HMMs). One significant contribution in this area has been a 
technique we developed for modeling the effects of phonetic coarticulation i  a robust way. The 
technique is based on estimating context-dependent models of each of the phonemes. We have 
shown that this basic model (and its extensions) has resulted in a significant improvement in word 
and sentence recognition accuracy. 
We have also developed the "stochastic segment model", which can model the correlation be- 
tween different parts of the phoneme directly. Initial experiments with this model on context- 
independent phonetic units reduced the recognition error by a factor of two lower than for the 
corresponding context-independent HMM models. However, the new method requires ignificantly 
more computation. 
In general, collecting a large amount of speech (about 30 minutes) from the particular speaker 
who will use the system will result in the highest recognition accuracy. However, one may need to 
minimize the amount of training speech from a new speaker without losing performance. We have 
developed a "probabilistic spectral mapping" technique for adapting a model from one speaker to 
a new speaker based on a small amount of speech. Using this technique, the recognition accuracy 
with only 2 minutes of training from the new speaker is equal to that usually achieved using 20 
minutes of speaker-dependent training. 
In this project we have combined various knowledge sources together to produce the BYBLOS 
speech recognition system. The system was tested on the DARPA Resource Management Database 
under several grammar conditions and resulted in higher ecognition accuracies than had previously 
been reported for tasks of this complexity. 
In the area of real-time speech recognition we have pursued two activities: the implementation f 
our speech recognition algorithms on a general-purpose parallel processor and a joint effort with UC 
berkeley and SRI to design and build a special-purpose board-set capable of real-time continuous 
speech recognition with a large vocabulary (3000 words) and a statistical language model. In this 
latter activity, we provided the BYBLOS recognition code, and consulted on the changes that would 
be appropriate for a special purpose VLSI implementation. The first prototype of this board set is 
expected to be completed by mid t989. 
The parallel implementation research used the BBN Butterfly TM parallel processor. To achieve 
near linear parallel efficiency on large configurations (97 processors) required some tuning of the 
communication a d synchronization procedures. The final result was a factor of 79 increase in speed 
on the 97-processor machine over the speed on a single processor. The near-real-time BYBLOS 
speech recognition system on a 32-processor Butterfly TM was demonstrated and used in several 
"live" tests.
