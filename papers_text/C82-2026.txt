The eystem BACON (Berlin Autcmatle COnstruction for 
semantic Networks) is an experimental intelligent qaestion- 
-answerlng system with a nataral la~uage interface based on

Scienoe at  the Technical  Un ivers i ty  of Ber l in .  The pro~eet 
was supported by the Min is t ry  fo r  Science and Technology

ANSGEN - "ANSwer GENerator" translates the system ?s react-

MSRL - "Modal Semantic Representation Language" is the 
representation language of the BACON-system and 
there fore  the  center  of  the  whole system?  
The syntax  of  MSRL i s  reou~s iv ly  de f ined  fo l low ing  the  
principles of common logical languages? The basic (finite) 
set  of  operators  i s  der ided  in to  two d is jo in t  subsets :  
- te l~m~ers  are  operators  which descr ibe  ob jec ts  of  the  
wor ld  of  d i sca l rse .  They inc lude  the  term var iab les .  
- fo rmelmakers  descr ibe  the  re la t ions  between these  
ob jec ts ,  between fo rmulas  or  between ob jec ts  and 
fo l~u las  ?
An operator  w i th  i t s  (poss ib ly  empty) l i s t  o f  a rgmnents  
const i tu tes  a we l l  formed MSRL-express ion.  
A very  impor tant  concept  of MSRL i s  the  concept  of  sor ts .  
The set  of sor ts  (p roper  names of  sor ts )  induces  a par t i t ion  
of  the  set  of  te rms.  A par t ia l  o rder ing  ca l led  "compat ib i l i ty  
of  sor ts"  induces  a la t t i ce  s t r -c ture  on the  set  of  sor ts ?  
By ass ign ing  a l i s t  of  sor ts  (one sor t  fo r  each argument 
p lace)  ca l led  "sor ta l  pat tern"  to  each operator  we get  
additional semantic constraints for MSR L expressions, The 
oonstructlon of the sortal pattern of an operator is based

on knowledge about the wor ld  of d i scourse .  I t  determines  the 
semantic  category  of  the operator ' s  arguments.  The process  of  
the assignment of  meaning by BEAST i s  based on the cor ra l  
c lass i f i ca t ion  of  terms and the  cor ra l  pat te rn  of  the operator .  
This  process  performs a semant ica l l y  cor rec t  ass ignment be-  
tween the operator  const i tu t ing  the sentence and ~he terms 
being ab le  to become arguments.  
There have been some unaer ly ing  pr inc ip les /cond i t ions  
which a f fec ted  the spec ia l  ATN formal i sm in  BEAST: 
1. BF~ST should emphasize a semant ica l  ana lys i s  which con-  
s t i tu tes  the re la t ionsh ip  between the natura l  language 
sentence and I t s  meaning representat ion .  The aim i s  the 
c reat ion  of  a MSRL express ion  that  represents  the meaning 
of  the input  sentence .  
2. The Ex~mmar component should fo l low the "pr inc ip le  of  
minimal in fo rmat ion" -  The process  of  t rans la t ion  t r ies  
to  get  a long With as l i t t le  in fo rmat ion  as poss ib le .  Only 
i f  that  does not work, more (not only exp l i ca te  but a l so  ? 
imp l i c i t )  In fo rmat ion  conta ined  in  the sentence need to  
be d i scovered .  
3. The ATN had to be pr0Ex~nmed in  SXMULA s ince  the res t  of  
the system a l ready  ex is ted  in  SXMULA. 
Our AT~ formal ism i s  founded on the formal ism developed 
by Woods, uses ideas  of  the semant ic  ATSs and takes  the des -  
c r ibed  pr inc ip les  in to  account by some mod i f i ca t ions ,  ex tent -  
ions  and const ra in ts .  
We use an ATN compi l ing  system which t rana la tes  in  a 
f i r s t  s tep  the ATN representat ion  of  the  g~a~mar in to  a 
SIMULA program, and in  a second s tep  th i s  3XMULA representat -  
ion  together  wi th the o ther  components I s  t rans la ted  in to  an 
executab le  machine proE~aa. 
The main feature5 of  these  AT~s ares 
- they use In  add i t ion  to syntact i c  ca tegor ies  semantic  
ca tegor ies  and const i tuents  
- 118  - 
- that  use semant ic  const ra in ts  to  se lec t  the best  pass 
through the network 
- and they c reate  semantic  representat ions .  
The fo~aa l iem supports  the t reatment  of a l te rnat ives  at  
both s ides :  a t  the sour0~ . lan~uaRe by the poss ib i l i ty  of

F igure  2: ATN compi l ing  sys tem 
The focus  of  our in teres t  in  fu ture  development i s  an 
in tegrat ion  of  the ATN formal i~n at  a h igher  leve l ,  namely 
the leve l  o f  the representat ion  language MSRL i t se l f ,  ins tead  
of leve l  of  the programming language SY~ULA. For th i s  purpose 
MSRL has to  be extended to represent  p rocedura l  s t ruc t~ee 
l i ke  A~Ns. The main th ing  i s  that  these  s t ruc tures  are  normal 
MSRL express ions ,  and there fore  on the one hand they are 
manageble by the knowledge base (s to rab le  and re t r ievab le )  
but on the o ther  hand they are a l so  eva luab le .  S tar t ing  from 
the fac t  that  the aTN represents  the grammatical  knowledge 
of  the system we have the ab i l i ty  to  handle th i s  knowledge 
- 119  - 
J us t  l i ke  the  knowledge about  the  wor ld  of  d i sooursez  to  
ask  quest ions  about  i t  and to  mod i fy  I t .  
In  the  same way we can  represent  the  lex ica l  knowledge 
in  te rms o f  the  representat ion  language.  Together  w i th  the  
extens ion  descr ibed  above  there  w i l l  'be the  poss ib i l i ty  to  
hand le  prooedu l 'a l  l ex ica l  knowledge,  espec ia l l y  in  the  case  
o f  ATHs to  l ink  a word in  the  lex icon  w i th  a sUbATH wh ich  
has  the  task  to  per fo rm the  next  par t  o f  the  ana lys i s  when 
- t r iggered  by the  occu. rance o f  th i s  word in  the  natura l  
language sentence. 
I n  ou~ lec ture  we w i l l  car ry  out  the  fo l low ing  po in ts :  
- the  descr ip t ion  o f  the  ATN fomal i sm in  BEAST 
- the  pro jec ted  extens ions  o f  MSRL 
- the  consequences  o f  these  extens ions  on the  sys tem
