1 Introduct ion 
Almost all commercial machine translation 
(MT) systems to date are designed for multi- 
lingual users, normally with post-editing facil- 
ities (Melby, 1987). To cater for the needs of 
users not skilled in either the source language or 
the target language an MT system must provide 
facilities for the user to check into the quality of 
the translation, without knowing the foreign lan- 
guage. In this note two presumptions are made: 
first, we discuss only translation from the user's 
native language into a foreign language (or "exo 
port translation"); second, we will restrict the 
quality checking to accuracy checking only, leav- 
ing style considerations a ide. 
In the following sections we will first dis- 
cuss approaches to assuring correct translation, 
and then describe the selective confirmation ap- 
proach adopted in our MT system. 
2 Approaches to Assuring 
Correct Translation 
2.1 Back  Trans la t ion  
The seemingly most natural way of finding out 
whether the translation into the target language 
(henceforth forward translation) is correct is to 
translate the forward translation back into the 
source language (back translation). This ap- 
proach can indeed expose the wrong forward 
translations if the back translations differ signif- 
icantly from the original, but is has its complex- 
ities and is not reliable. An MT system may ei- 
ther employ grammars designed to be reversible, 
i.e., to be used for both generation and analy-

sis, or employ separate grammars for generation 
and analysis. In the former case, theoretically 
whatever the forward translations are, the back 
translation will always produce sentences in the 
source language that are very close, if not iden- 
tical, to the original. As a result we have no way 
to tell whether the forward translation is correct 
or not. 
If the back translation is done in a system 
where separate grammars are used for generation 
and analysis, then the back translation itself may 
be incorrect inasmuch as the forward translation 
might be, so that a corT~ect forward translation 
may be wrongly translated back, or vice versa. 
In either case there is no guarantee of accuracy. 
2.2 Paraphras ing  
In this approach, the system generates para- 
phrase(s) for the original sentence, based upon 
the syntactic and semantic analysis result, before 
passing it for further processing (by the transfer 
and/or generation component). The user checks 
the paraphrase and gives the system directives 
by either confirming or rejecting it. For exam- 
ple, for the input sentence 
(la) The man saw the woman in the park with 
the telescope. 
the system might produce the following para- 
phrase for the user to check: 
(lb) With the telescope, the man saw the 
woman who was in the park. 
The problem with the paraphrasing approach 
is that the recovery may come in late, after a 
considerable amount of time is spent doing all 
the syntactic and semantic analysis required for 
generating the paraphrase. If the input sentence 
is tong and complex the cost can be high. Fur- 
thermore, it may not be unusual that only after 
several trials the user finally accepts an appro-- 
364 i 
priate :paraphrase, with all the previous efforts 
wasted. 
2.3 P re -ed i t ing  
This is the approach adopted by many comrner- 
ciM MT systems (very often paired with post- 
editing). It requires the user to edit the input 
sentences before they are passed to the system 
for analysis and subsequent processing. Tile ma- 
chine has a predefined translation capacity which 
must be known to the use:' so that anything in 
the text which may cause difficulties to the sys- 
tem will be removed or rewritten. For example, 
for the following sentence 
(2a) The woman cannot bear children. 
if the u';er knows the system would have difficul- 
ties resolving the ambiguous word "bear", s/he 
can rewrite the sentence as follows (if ttlat is 
what s/he wants to say): 
(2b) The woman cannot give birth to children. 
To apply pre-editing, a set of rules must first 
be devi,;ed to set up lexicat and structural con- 
straints, then the user must keep the rules in 
mind and apply them consistently. This may 
involve expensive training of system users and 
impose strong restrictions on the system use in 
practice. 
2.4 In teract ive  D isamblguat ion  
Interactive disambiguation can take place at two 
levels. At the lexical level, whenever an ambigu- 
ous word is encountered, the user can be asked to 
help. (Carbonell and Tornita, 1987) gives an ex- 
ample of reso!ving word-sense ambiguity in this 
approach: 
The word "pen" means: 
1) a writing pen 
2) a play pen 
N UMBER ?> 
The problem with this approach is, given that 
any natural language is highly polysemous, the 
frequent occurrence of ambiguity at tile lexical 
level will unnecessarily prolong the translation 
process a~d easily bore the user. Moreover, with 
lexical items with many different senses, it may 
become very difficult to pinpoint one in particu- 
lar from a screenful of choices. 
At the structural level, ambiguities can also be 
referred to the user for disam.biguation~ as is done 
in Ntran, an English-to-Japanese prototype MT 
system for monolingual users (Wood and Chan- 
dler, 1988). For the sentence 
(3) The cursor corresponds to the puck posi~ 
tion on the tablet. 
Ntran asks the user to choose either 1 or 2 from 
the following: 
1 on is location of position 
2 on is location of co~espond 
(here "on" represents "on the tablet".) The 
user must be more or less familiar with linguis- 
tics to make correct choices. This may inconve- 
nience some users; but the more severe problem 
is that the number of possible interpretations of
an ambiguous tructure can reach the hundreds 
(Church and Pall1, 1982), making their handling 
very difficult. 
3 Se lec t ive  Conf i rmat ion  
The basic idea behind our approach, described 
in this section, is to let the machine do most of 
the work without human interference, and only 
at certain decision making points ask for human 
assistance. We choose phrases as the level for 
user confirmation because at this level tile sys- 
tem both avoids frequent and unintelligent ques- 
tioning of the user (as is the case with the in- 
teractive disambignation approach at the lexicM 
level) and does not suffer from late recovery (as is 
the case with the paraphrase strategy). As an 
example, let us consider the following sentence. 
(4) The tMented conductor dated a young star. 
The system does not ask for the user's help 
the first time it sees the word "conductor", but 
wMts tili the analysis of the NP with "conduc- 
tor" as its head is complete just before the tree 
representation is built. At this point it asks: 
Does "conductor" here mean "an official on a 
bus or" train or tram who collects fares"? (y/n) 
tIere the system selected one of the "human 
being" senses of the word "conductor" as a result 
of carrying out semantic matches of the modifier 
"talented" and the head noun (a tram conductor 
can certainly be talented). The order of select- 
ing the "bus conductor" sense vs. the "orchestra 
conductor" one is arbitrary, though with more 
domain information and statisticM consideration 
preference can be given to one over the other. If 
the user answers "no" the system backtracks to 
find another "human being" interpretation ofthe 
word: 
Does "conductor" here mean "a person who 
conducts an orchestra" ? (y/n) 
The answer from the user at this point is likely 
to be "yes". If, however, the user insists on 
2 365 
"no" the system will relax the semantic con- 
straints (Huang, 1988) and accepts the "sub- 
stance" sense of the word, treating "talented" 
as used metaphorically. 
Suppose the user has chosen the "orchestra 
conductor" sense. The system continues the 
parsing to process the finite verb "dated" and 
upon the completion of subject-verb match for 
deciding a proper sense for the verb which suits 
the selected sense for "conductor", it asks the 
user to confirm its choice: 
Does "date" here mean "to go out on dates 
with"? (y/n)  
If the user answers "yes" the systems carries 
on to find an interpretation for the object NP, 
using the chosen sense of "date" to help disam- 
biguate "star": 
Does "star" here mean '% celebrity"? (y/n)  
Similar to the confirmations described above, 
when prepositional phrases are processed confir- 
mation is carried out after the semantic matches 
have resolved the attachment ambiguity of the 
PPs. Confirmations would also be needed at 
points where semantic matches are carried out 
to resolve the coordinate conjunction ambiguity, 
such as contained in the phrase "the man and the 
woman with an umbrella" ("\[the man\] and \[the 
woman with an umbrella\]" vs. "\[the man and 
the woman\] with an umbrella") 1 (I-Iuang, 1983). 
An important consideration in designing the 
interactive system is the number of questions 
asked of the user. The less questions asked, the 
more productive the system will be, and the less 
bored the user will become. 
Ideally the system should be intelligent enough 
not to ask for confirmation about the word 
"dated" when processing 
(5) ANU dated the world's oldest rock. 
or 
(6) Ann dated the department's oldest profes- 
sor. 
Whereas if the input sentence is
(7) Ann dated the town's oldest coach. 
the user may not feel it unreasonable if the sys- 
tem asks him/her to confirm the disambigua- 
tion of "dated", "oldest", and "coach". What 
makes difference here is the so called "gen- 
uine" ambiguity (sentences for which more than 
1At this stage only confirmations involving NPs, NP- 
Verb pairs and Verb-Np pairs are implemented, although 
in the automatic version of the system all semantic 
matches have been executed ((Huang, 1987) and (Wilks 
et ~1., 198~)). 
one interpretation is meaningful): sentences (5) 
and (6) should have only one valid interpre- 
tation each according to our common knowl- 
edge even though when standing in isolation the 
word "dated" is ambiguous, whereas entence (7) 
might have two meaningful readings. 
If user confirmation is required only for sen- 
tences containing enuine ambiguity, the system 
will become much more efficient, without en- 
dangering the quality of the translation. But 
to decide when a word or a structure is "gen- 
uinely" ambiguous may involve more computing 
resources than is worthwhile employing. First 
of all it has to exhaust he whole search space, 
both syntactic and semantic, to find out whether 
more than one meaningful interpretation exists, 
despite the fact that often the first such inter- 
pretation might well be the only one. Secondly 
it can be very tricky to draw a clear line between 
"meaningful" and "meaningless" interpretations. 
For example, the sentence 
(8) John cannot bear children. 
might be judged as not "genuinely" ambiguous 
because common sense dictates that since John is 
a male (based on world knowledge of names), it is 
impossible for him to give birth to children, and 
therefore "bear" can have only the interpretation 
"to tolerate" in this context. But then if you tell 
your granddaughter "Joim cannot bear children 
because he is a male", you are using "bear" in 
the other sense, although "tolerate" i,~ still an 
acceptable interpretation for %ear".  
For this reason at the current stage we have 
not attempted at singling out genuinely ambigu- 
ous sentences but instead we employ certain do- 
main information and statistical consideration 
in arranging the system's lexicon, so that for 
sentence (4) ("The talented conductor dated a 
young star.") it may well be the case that the 
user need only answer "yes" once to each of the 
questions the system asks. The worst case is 
when the intended meaning of the sentence is 
"abnormal" or metaphorical, for example when 
it is meant for sentence (4) to be interpreted as 
"the talented tram conductor ascertained the age 
of a new celestial object". In such cases the user 
will have to answer the system's questions ev- 
eral times over the same word. 
With richer knowledge bases and more power- 
ful inference ngines and computing facilities it 
may become practical to first recognize genuinely 
ambiguous entences and then to assign scores to 
different interpretations of such sentences, and fi- 
366 3 
nally present hem to the user ibr confirmation 
in the order of their scores.
