Abstract 
This paper introduces simplified yet effective 
features that can robustly identify named enti-
ties in Arabic text without the need for mor-
phological or syntactic analysis or gazetteers. 
A CRF sequence labeling model is trained on 
features that primarily use character n-gram of 
leading and trailing letters in words and word 
n-grams.  The proposed features help over-
come some of the morphological and ortho-
graphic complexities of Arabic.  In comparing 
to results in the literature using Arabic specific 
features such POS tags on the same dataset 
and same CRF implementation, the results in 
this paper are lower by 2 F-measure points for 
locations, but are better by 8 points for organi-
zations and 9 points for persons.     
1 Introduction 
Named entity recognition (NER) continues to be 
an important part of many NLP applications such 
as information extraction, machine translation, 
and question answering (Benajiba et al, 2008).  
NER is concerned with identifying sequences of 
words referring to named entities (NE?s) such as 
persons, locations, and organizations.  For exam-
ple, in the word sequence ?Alan Mulally, CEO of 
Detroit based Ford Motor Company,? Alan Mu-
lally, Detroit, and Ford Motor Company would 
be identified as a person, a location, and an or-
ganization respectively.   
Arabic is a Semitic language that present inter-
esting morphological and orthographic challeng-
es that may complicate NER.  Some of these 
challenges include: 
? Coordinating conjunctions, prepositions, 
possessive pronouns, and determiners are 
typically attached to words as prefixes or 
suffixes.   
? Proper names are often common language 
words.  For example, the proper name 
?Iman? also means faith. 
? Lack capitalization of proper nouns.  
The paper introduces a simplified set of features 
that can robustly identify NER for Arabic with-
out the need for morphological or syntactic anal-
ysis.  The proposed features include: word lead-
ing and trailing character n-gram features that 
help handle prefix and suffix attachment; word 
n-gram probability based features that attempt to 
capture the distribution of NE?s in text; word 
sequence features; and word length.   
The contributions of this paper are as follows: 
1. Identifying simplified features that work well 
for Arabic without gazetteers and without 
morphological and syntactic features, leading 
to improvements over previously reported re-
sults. 
2. Using leading and trailing character n-grams 
in words, which help capture valuable mor-
phological and orthographic clues that would 
indicate or counter-indicate the presence of 
NE?s. 
3. Incorporating word language modeling based 
features to capture word associations and rela-
tive distribution of named entities in text. 
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) sequence la-
beling was used in identifying NE?s, and the ex-
periments were performed on two standard Ara-
bic NER datasets.   
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:  
Section 2 surveys prior work on Arabic NER; 
Section 3 introduces the proposed features and 
motivates their use; Section 4 describes experi-
mental setup and evaluation sets; Section 5 re-
ports on experimental results; and Section 6 con-
cludes the paper. 
2 Background  
Much work has been done on NER with multiple 
evaluation forums dedicated to information ex-
traction in general and to NER in specific.  
Nadeau and Sekine (2009) surveyed lots of work 
on NER for a variety of languages and using a 
myriad of techniques.  Significant work has been 
conducted by Benajiba and colleagues on Arabic 
NER (Benajiba and Rosso, 2008; Benajiba et al, 
2008; Benajiba and Rosso, 2007; Benajiba et al, 
110
2007).  Benajiba et al (2007) used a maximum 
entropy based classification trained on a feature 
set that include the use of gazetteers and a stop-
word list, appearance of a NE in the training set, 
leading and trailing word bigrams, and the tag of 
the previous word.  They reported 80%, 37%, 
and 47% F-measure for locations, organizations, 
and persons respectively.  Benajiba and Rosso 
(2007) improved their system by incorporating 
POS tags to improve NE boundary detection.  
They reported 87%, 46%, and 52% F-measure 
for locations, organizations, and persons respec-
tively.  Benajiba and Rosso (2008) used CRF 
sequence labeling and incorporated many lan-
guage specific features, namely POS tagging, 
base-phrase chunking, Arabic tokenization, and 
adjectives indicating nationality.  They reported 
that tokenization generally improved recall.  Us-
ing POS tagging generally improved recall at the 
expense of precision, leading to overall im-
provement in F-measure.  Using all their sug-
gested features they reported 90%, 66%, and 
73% F-measure for location, organization, and 
persons respectively.   In Benajiba et al (2008), 
they examined the same feature set on the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE) datasets using 
CRF sequence labeling and Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) classifier.  They did not report per 
category F-measure, but they reported overall 
81%, 75%, and 78% macro-average F-measure 
for broadcast news and newswire on the ACE 
2003, 2004, and 2005 datasets respectively.  
Huang (2005) used an HMM based NE recog-
nizer for Arabic and reported 77% F-measure on 
the ACE 2003 dataset.  Farber et al (2008) used 
POS tags obtained from an Arabic morphological 
analyzer to enhance NER.  They reported 70% F-
measure on the ACE 2005 dataset.  Shaalan and 
Raza (2007) reported on a rule-based system that 
uses hand crafted grammars and regular expres-
sions in conjunction with gazetteers.  They re-
ported upwards of 93% F-measure, but they con-
ducted their experiments on non-standard da-
tasets, making comparison difficult. 
McNamee and Mayfield (2002) explored the 
training of an SVM classifier using many lan-
guage independent binary features such as lead-
ing and trailing letters in a word, word length, 
presence of digits in a word, and capitalization.  
They reported promising results for Spanish and 
Dutch.  In follow on work, Mayfield et al (2003) 
used thousands of language independent features 
such character n-grams, capitalization, word 
length, and position in a sentence, along with 
language dependent features such as POS tags 
and BP chunking.  For English, they reported 
89%, 79%, and 91% F-measure for location, or-
ganization, and persons respectively. 
The use of CRF sequence labeling has been 
increasing over the past few years (McCallum 
and Li, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2009) with 
good success (Benajiba and Rosso, 2008).  
Though, CRF?s are not guaranteed to be better 
than SVM?s (Benajiba et al, 2008). 
3 NER Features 
For this work, a CRF sequence labeling was 
used.  The advantage of using CRF is that they 
combine HMM-like generative power with clas-
sifier-like discrimination (Lafferty et al, 2001; 
Sha and Pereira, 2003).  When a CRF makes a 
decision on the label to assign to a word, it also 
accounts for the previous and succeeding words.  
The CRF was trained on a large set of surface 
features to minimize the use of Arabic morpho-
logical and syntactic features.  Apart from stem-
ming two coordinating conjunctions, no other 
Arabic specific features were used.   
The features used were as follows: 
? Leading and trailing character bigrams (6bi).  
For a given word composed of the letter se-
quence   
 , where    and    are a start and 
end word markers respectively, the first three 
bigrams (   
 ,   
 , and   
 ) and last three bi-
grams (    
   ,      
   , and     
 ) were used as 
features.  Using leading and trailing charac-
ter bigrams of a word was an attempt to ac-
count for morphological and orthographic 
complexities of Arabic and to capture sur-
face clues that would indicate the presence of 
a NE or not.  For example, plural forms of 
common words in Arabic are often obtained 
by attaching the suffixes wn1 (??) or yn (??) 
for masculine nouns and At (??) for feminine 
nouns.  Presence of such plural form markers 
would generally indicate a plural noun, but 
would counter-indicate a NE.  Also, verbs in 
present tense start with the letters A (?), t (?), 
y (?), and n (?). These would contribute to 
concluding that a word may not be a NE.  
Further, coordinate conjunctions, such as f 
(?) and w (?), and prepositions, such as b 
(?), k (?), and l (?), composed of single let-
ters are often attached as prefixes to words.  
Accounting for them may help overcome 
some of the problems associated with not 
                                                 
1 Arabic letters are presented using the Buckwalter 
transliteration scheme 
111
stemming.  Further, the determiner Al (??) 
may be a good indicator for proper nouns 
particularly in the case of organizations.  
This would be captured by the second bi-
gram from the head of the word.  If the de-
terminer is preceded by a coordinating con-
junction, the third bigram from the head of 
the word would be able to capture this fea-
ture. 
? Leading and trailing character trigrams 
(6tri).  For a given word composed of the 
letter sequence   
 , where    and    are a start 
and end word markers respectively, the first 
three trigrams (  
 ,   
 , and   
 ) and last three 
trigrams (    
   ,      
   , and     
 ) were used as 
features.  The rationale for using these fea-
tures is very similar to that of using character 
bigrams.  The added value of using character 
trigrams, is that they would allow for the 
capture of combinations of prefixes and suf-
fixes.  For example, a word may begin with 
the prefixes w+Al (???), which are a coordi-
nating conjunction and determiner respec-
tively. 
? Leading and trailing character 4-grams 
(6quad).  For a given word composed of the 
letter sequence   
 , where    and    are a start 
and end word markers respectively, the first 
three 4 grams (  
 ,   
 , and   
 ) and last three 4 
grams (    
   ,      
   , and     
 ) were used as 
features.  Similar to leading and trailing tri-
grams, these features can capture combina-
tions of prefixes and suffixes. 
? Word position (WP).  The feature captures 
the relative position of a word in a sentence 
as follows: 
   
                 
               
 
Typically, Arabic is a VSO language.  Thus, 
NE?s in specific and nouns in general do not 
start sentences. 
? Word length (WL).  The feature captures the 
length of named entities, as some NE?s, par-
ticularly transliterated NE?s, may be longer 
than regular words. 
? Word unigram probability (1gP).  This is 
simply the unigram probability of word.  Ac-
counting for unigram probability would help 
exclude common words.  Also, named enti-
ties are often out-of-vocabulary words. 
? Word with previous and word with succeed-
ing word-unigram ratio (1gPr).  Given a 
word wi, these two features are computed as: 
      
 (  )
 (    )
 
  
      
 (    )
 (  )
 
This feature would potentially capture major 
shifts between word probabilities.  For ex-
ample, a named entity is likely to have much 
lower probability compared to the word be-
fore it and the word after it. 
? Features that account for dependence be-
tween words in a named entity.  Popular 
NE?s are likely collocations, and words that 
make up named entities don?t occur next to 
each other by chance.  These features are as 
follows: 
o Word with previous and word with succeed-
ing word bigram (2gP).  For a given word wi, 
the two bigram probabilities are p(wi-1wi) and 
p(wiwi+1).  Words composing named entities 
are likely conditionally dependent. 
o t-test between a word and the word that pre-
cedes and succeeds it (T).  Given a word se-
quence wi and wi+1: 
   
 ?   
? 
 
 
 
Wher ?     (      ),   (  )   (    ) , 
    ?, and N is the number of words in the 
corpus (Manning and Schutze, 1999). 
o Mutual information between a word and the 
word that precedes and succeeds it (MI).  
Given a word sequence wi and wi+1: 
         [
 ?
 
] , where  ? and   are identical 
to those in the t-test. 
? Character n-gram probability (3gCLM).  
Given character trigram language models for 
locations, persons, organizations, and non-
NE?s, the four features are just the character 
language model probabilities using the four 
different language models.  The motivation 
for these features stem from the likelihood 
that NE?s may have a different distribution 
of characters particularly for person names.  
This stems from the fact that many NE?s are 
transliterated names. 
4 Experimental Setup 
4.1 Datasets 
For this work, the NE?s of interest were persons, 
locations, and organizations only.  Two datasets 
were used for the work in this paper.  The first 
112
was a NE tagged dataset developed by Binajiba 
et al (2007).  The Binajiba dataset is composed 
of newswire articles totaling more than 150,000 
words.  The number of different NE?s in the col-
lection are: 
Locations (LOC)  878 
Organizations (ORG)  342 
Persons (PER)   689 
The second was the Arabic Automatic Content 
Extraction (ACE) 2005 dataset.  The ACE da-
taset is composed of newswire, broadcast news, 
and weblogs.  For experiments in this work, the 
weblogs portion of the ACE collection was ex-
cluded, because weblogs often include colloquial 
Arabic that does not conform to modern standard 
Arabic.  Also, ACE tags contain many sub-
categories.  For example, locations are tagged as 
regions, bodies of water, states, etc.  All sub-tags 
were ignored and were conflated to the base tags 
(LOC, ORG, PER).  Further, out of the 40 sub-
entity types, entities belonging to the following 
13 ACE sub-entity types were excluded because 
they require anaphora resolution or they refer to 
non-specific NE?s: nominal, pronominal, kind of 
entity (as opposed to a specific entity), negative-
ly quantified entity, underspecified entity, ad-
dress, boundary (eg. border), celestial object 
(comet), entertainment venue (eg. movie theater), 
sport (eg. football), indeterminate (eg. human), 
vehicle, and weapon.  The total number of words 
in the collection is 98,530 words (66,590 from 
newswire and 31,940 from broadcast news).  The 
number of NE?s is as follows: 
Locations (LOC)  867 
Organizations (ORG)  269 
Persons (PER)   524 
Since both collections do not follow the same 
tagging conventions, training and testing were 
conducted separately for each collection.  Each 
collection was 80/20 split for training and test-
ing. 
4.2 Data Processing and Sequence Labeling 
Training and testing were done using CRF++ 
which is a CRF sequence label toolkit.  The fol-
lowing processing steps of Arabic were per-
formed: 
? The coordinating conjunctions w (?) and f 
(?), which always appear as the first prefix-
es in a word, were optionally stemmed. w 
and f were stemmed using an in-house Ara-
bic stemmer that is a reimplementation of the 
stemmer proposed by Lee et al (2003).  
However, stemming w or f could have been 
done by stemming the w or f and searching 
for the stemmed word in a large Arabic cor-
pus.  If the stemmed word appears more than 
a certain count, then stemming was appropri-
ate. 
? The different forms of alef (A (?), | (?), > (?), 
and < (?)) were normalized to A (?), y (?) and 
Y (?) were normalized to y (?), and p (?) was 
mapped to h (??). 
4.3 Evaluation  
The figures of merit for evaluation were preci-
sion, recall, and F-measure (? = 1), with evalua-
tion being conducted at the phrase level.  Report-
ing experiments with all the different combina-
tions of features would adversely affect the read-
ability of the paper.  Thus, to ascertain the con-
tribution of the different features, a set of 15 ex-
periments are being reported for both datasets.  
The experiments were conducted using raw Ara-
bic words (3w) and stems (3s).  Using the short 
names of features (bolded after feature names in 
section 3), the experiments were as follows: 
? 3w 
? 3w_6bi 
? 3w_6bi_6tri 
? 3w_6bi_6tri_6quad 
? 3w_6bi_6tri_6quad_WL 
? 3w_6bi_6tri_6quad_WP 
? 3s 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_1gP 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_1gPr_1gP 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_2gP 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_3gCLM 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_MI 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_T 
? 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad_T_MI 
5 Experimental Results 
Table 1 lists the results for the Benajiba and 
ACE datasets respectively.  Tables 2 and 3 report 
the best obtained results for both datasets.  The 
results include precision (P), recall (R), and F-
measure (F) for NE?s of types location (LOC), 
organization (ORG), and person (PER).  The best 
results for P, R, and F are bolded in the tables.  
In comparing the base experiments 3w and 3s in 
which the only the surface forms and the stems 
were used respectively, both produced the high-
est precision.  However, 3s improved recall over 
3w by 7, 13, and 14 points for LOC, ORG, and 
PER respectively on the Benajiba dataset.  
Though using 3s led to a drop in P for ORG 
113
compared to 3w, it actually led to improvement 
in P for PER.  Similar results were observed for 
the ACE dataset, but the differences were less 
pronounced with 1% to 2% improvements in re-
call.  However, when including the 6bi, 6tri, and 
6quad features the difference between using 
words or stems dropped to about 1 point in recall 
and nearly no difference in precision.  This 
would indicate the effectiveness of using leading 
and trailing character n-grams in overcoming 
morphological and orthographic complexities.

The 3s_6bi_6tri_6quad run produced nearly the 
best F-measure for both datasets, with extra fea-
tures improving overall F-measure by at most 1 
point. 
Using t-test T and mutual information MI did 
not yield any improvement in either recall or 
precision, and often hurt overall F-measure.  As 
highlighted in the results, the 1gP, 2gP, WL, WP, 
and 3gCLM typically improved recall slightly, 
often leading to 1 point improvement in overall 
F-measure. 
To compare to results in the literature, Table 4 
reports the results obtained by Benajiba and Ros-
so (2008) on the Benajiba dataset using the 
CRF++ implementation of CRF sequence label-
ing trained on a variety of Arabic language spe-
cific features.  The comparison was not done on 
their results on the ACE 2005 dataset due to po-
tential difference in tags.  The averages in Tables 
2, 3, and 4 are macro-averages as opposed to mi-
cro-averages reported by Benajiba and Rosso 
(2008).  In comparing Tables 2 and 4, the fea-
tures suggested in this paper reduced F-measure 
for locations by 2 points, but improved F-
measure for organizations and persons by 8 
points and 9 points respectively, due to im-
provements in both precision and recall.

The notable part of this work is that using a sim-
plified feature set outperforms linguistic features.  
As explained in Section 3, using leading and 
trailing character n-grams implicitly capture 
morphological and syntactic features that typical-
ly used for Arabic lemmatization and POS tag-
ging (Diab, 2009).  The improvement over using 
linguistic features could possibly be attributed to 
the following reasons:  not all prefixes and suf-
fixes types equally help in identifying named 
entities (ex. appearance of a definite article or 
not); not all prefixes and suffix surface forms 
equally help (ex. appearance of the coordinating 
conjunction w ??? vs. f ???); and mistakes in 
stemming and POS tagging.  The lag in recall for 
locations behind the work of Benajiba and Rosso 
(2008) could be due to the absence of location 
gazetteers.  
6 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper presented a set of simplified yet effec-
tive features for named entity recognition in Ar-
abic.  The features helped overcome some of the 
morphological and orthographic complexities of 
Arabic.  The features included the leading and 
trailing character n-grams in words, word associ-
ation features such as t-test, mutual information, 
and word n-grams, and surface features such 
word length and relative word position in a sen-
tence.  The most important features were leading 
and trailing character n-grams in words.  The 
proposed feature set yielded improved results 
over those in the literature with as much as 9 
point F-measure improvement for recognizing 
persons. 
For future work, the authors would like to exam-
ine the effectiveness of the proposed feature set 
on other morphologically complex languages, 
particularly Semitic languages.  Also, it is worth 
examining the combination of the proposed fea-
tures with morphological features.
