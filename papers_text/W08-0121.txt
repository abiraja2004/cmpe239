Abstract
When people engage in conversation, they adapt the way they speak to
the speaking style of their conversational partner in a variety of ways. For
example, they may adopt a certain way of describing something based upon
the way their conversational partner describes it, or adapt their pitch range
or speaking rate to a conversational partner?s. They may even align their
turn-taking style or use of cue phrases to match their partner?s. These types
of entrainment have been shown to correlate with various measures of task
success and dialogue naturalness. While there is considerable evidence for
lexical entrainment from laboratory experiments, much less is known about
other types of acoustic-prosodic and discourse-level entrainment and little
work has been done to examine entrainments in multiple modalities for the
same dialogue. We will discuss work on entrainment in multiple dimensions
in the Columbia Games Corpus. Our goal is to understand how the different
varieties of entrainment correlate with one another and to determine which
types of entrainment will be both useful and feasible for Spoken Dialogue
Systems.
