A SNAPSHOT OF  TWO DARPA SPEECH 
AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS 
Charles L. Wayne 
DARPA/ISTO 
DARPA is investing in speech and natural 
language processing research to ensure the 
availability of key technology needed by the 
Department of Defense for a wide variety of 
applications. The research programs aim (a) to 
develop enabling component technology that can 
be integrated on demand and/or apidly tailored for 
specific applications and (b) to demonstrate that 
technology in limited prototypes. The programs 
are highly synergistic and emphasize objective 
performance evaluation. 
This note describes the overall programs; the 
following project summaries provide additional 
detail. 
SPOKEN LANGUAGE 
The DARPA Spoken Language program has two 
major components: large vocabulary speech 
recognition, which has many applications, and 
spoken language understanding, aimed at 
interactive problem solving. Both deal with 
spontaneous, goal-directed, natural anguage 
speech. And both aim for real-time, speaker- 
independent or speaker-adaptive op ration. The 
program also includes basic research to fuel the 
next generation ofadvances. 
Performance evaluation for speech recognition is
currently being conducted using the Resource 
Management (RM) corpus, which consists of 
read queries and commands, and the Air Travel 
Information System (ATIS) corpus, which 
consists of spontaneous queries and commands. 
Plans are underway to expand the ATIS corpus 
and to replace the RM corpus with a more 
challenging one. 
Performance evaluation for speech understanding 
is being conducted with the ATIS corpus, 
collected from subjects interacting with a 
simulated (wizard-based) understanding system 
that contains certain data from the Official 
Airline Guide (OAG). 
In addition, several groups are also developing 
spoken language technology demonstration 
applications. The most advanced of these is 
MIT's Voyager system, which provides 
navigational assistance for Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. 
Groups currently being funded include BBN, 
Brown, BU, CMU, Dragon, Lincoln, MIT, SRI, 
TI, and UNISYS. The program is greatly 
enriched by the voluntary participation of AT&T 
in the periodic performance evaluations. 
WRITTEN LANGUAGE 
The Written Language program is developing the 
technology needed for large-scale t xt processing. 
The program encompasses message 
understanding, natural language learning, basic 
research, and corpus building. It will soon 
include work on machine translation. 
Performance evaluation of message understanding 
systems is done in terms of database template 
filling. Multisite evaluations take place in 
message understanding conferences (MUCs). 
MUC-2, which was held in 1989 used Navy 
OPREP messages. MUC-3, which is happening 
in two phases this year, is using FBIS news 
reports. Performance valuation of natural 
language l arning techniques also takes place (in 
part) in the context of the MUC process. 
Performance evaluation of machine translation 
algorithms will also be done on previously 
unseen, naturally occurring texts. DARPA's MT 
work is just beginning this year, and an 
important part of the initial phase will be to 
develop specific evaluation methodologies. 
Groups currently being funded include BBN, 
Columbia, NMSU, NYU, Penn, Rochester, SRI, 
and UCB. The program is greatly enriched by 
the participation of many other groups in the 
DARPA speech and natural language workshops 
and in the MUC process.
