Abstract
Paraphrases are useful for statistical machine
translation (SMT) and natural language pro-
cessing tasks. Distributional paraphrase gen-
eration is independent of parallel texts and
syntactic parses, and hence is suitable also
for resource-poor languages, but tends to erro-
neously rank antonyms, trend-contrasting, and
polarity-dissimilar candidates as good para-
phrases. We present here a novel method
for improving distributional paraphrasing by
filtering out such candidates. We evalu-
ate it in simulated low and mid-resourced
SMT tasks, translating from English to two
quite different languages. We show statisti-
cally significant gains in English-to-Chinese
translation quality, up to 1 BLEU from non-
filtered paraphrase-augmented models (1.6
BLEU from baseline). We also show that
yielding gains in translation to Arabic, a mor-
phologically rich language, is not straightfor-
ward.
1 Introduction
Paraphrase recognition and generation has proven
useful for various natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, including statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT), information retrieval, query expansion,
document summarization, and natural language gen-
eration. We concentrate here on phrase-level (as
opposed to sentence-level) paraphrasing for SMT.
Paraphrasing is useful for SMT as it increases trans-
lation coverage ? a persistent problem, even in large-
scale systems. Two common approaches are ?pivot?
and distributional paraphrasing. Pivot paraphrasing
translates phrases of interest to other languages and
back (Callison-Burch et al, 2006; Callison-Burch,
2008). It relies on parallel texts (or translation
phrase tables) in various languages, which are typ-
ically scarce, and hence limit its applicability. Dis-
tributional paraphrasing (Marton et al, 2009) gener-
ates paraphrases using a distributional semantic dis-
tance measure computed over a large monolingual
corpus.1 Monolingual corpora are relatively easy
and inexpensive to collect, but distributional seman-
tic distance measures are known to rank antonymous
and polarity-dissimilar phrasal candidates high. We
therefore attempt to identify and filter out such ill-
suited paraphrase candidates.
A phrase pair may have a varying degree of
antonymy, beyond the better-known complete op-
posites (hot / cold) and contradictions (did / did
not), e.g., weaker contrasts (hot / cool), contrast-
ing trends (covered / reduced coverage), or senti-
ment polarity (happy / sad). Information extrac-
tion, opinion mining and sentiment analysis litera-
ture has been grappling with identifying such pairs
(Pang and Lee, 2008), e.g., in order to distinguish
positive and negative reviews or comments, or to de-
tect contradictions (Marneffe et al, 2008; Voorhees,
2008). We transfer some of the insights, data and
techniques to the area of paraphrasing and SMT. We
distributionally expand a small seed set of antonyms
in an unsupervised manner, following Mohammad
et al (2008). We then present a method for fil-
tering antonymous and polarity-dissimilar distribu-
tional paraphrases using the expanded antonymous
list and a list of negators (e.g., cannot) and trend-
decreasing words (reduced). We evaluate the im-
pact of our approach in a SMT setting, where non-
1Other variants use a lexical resource in conjunction with
the monolingual corpus (Mirkin et al, 2009; Marton, 2010).
237
baseline translation models are augmented with dis-
tributional paraphrases. We show gains of up to
1 BLEU relative to non-filtered models (1.6 BLEU
from non-augmented baselines) in English-Chinese
models trained on small and medium-large size data,
but lower to no gains in English-Arabic. The small
training size simulates resource-poor languages.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
We describe distributional paraphrase generation in
Section 2, antonym discovery in Section 3, and
paraphrase-augmented SMT in Section 4. We then
report experimental results in Section 5, and discuss
the implications in Section 6. We survey related
work in Section 7, and conclude with future work
in Section 8.
2 Distributional Paraphrases
Our method improves on the method presented in
Marton et al (2009). Using a non-annotated mono-
lingual corpus, our method constructs distributional
profiles (DP; a.k.a. context vectors) of focal words
or phrases. Each DPphr is a vector containing log-
likelihood ratios of the focal phrase phr and each
word w in the corpus. Given a paraphrase candidate
phrase cand, the semantic distance between phr and
cand is calculated using the cosine of their respec-
tive DPs (McDonald, 2000). For details on DPs and
distributional measures, see Weeds et al (2004) and
Turney and Pantel (2010).
The search of the corpus for paraphrase candi-
dates is performed in the following manner:
1. For each focal phrase phr, build distributional
profile DPphr.
2. Gather contexts: for each occurrence of phr,
keep surrounding (left and right) context L R.
3. For each such context, gather paraphrase can-
didates cand which occur between L and R in
other locations in the training corpus, i.e., all
cand such that L cand R occur in the corpus.
4. For each candidate cand, build a profile
DPcand and measure profile similarity between
DPcand and DPphr.
5. Rank all cand according to the profile similar-
ity score.
6. Filter out every candidate cand that textually
entails phr: This is approximated by filtering
cand if its words all appear in phr in the same
order. For example, if phr is spoken softly, then
spoken very softly would be filtered out.
7. Filter out every candidate cand that is antony-
mous to phr (See Algorithm 1 below).
8. Output k-best remaining candidates above a
certain similarity score threshold t.
Most of the steps above are similar to, and have
been elaborated in, Marton et al (2009). Due to
space limitations, we concentrate on the main novel
element here, which is the antonym filtering step,
detailed below. Antonyms (largely speaking) are op-
posites, terms that contrast in meaning, such as hot /
cold. Negators are terms such as not and lost, which
often flip the meaning of the word or phrase that fol-
lows or contains them, e.g., confidence / lost confi-
dence. Details on obtaining their definitions and on
obtaining the antonymous pair list and the negator
list are given in Section 3.
Algorithm 1 Antonymous candidate filtering
Given an antonymous pair list, a negator list, and a
phrase-paraphrase candidate (phr-cand) pair list,
for all phr-cand pairs do
for all words w in phr do
if w is also in cand, and there is a negator up
to two words before it in either phr or cand
(but not both!) then
filter out this pair
if w, ant is an antonymous pair, and ant is
in cand, and there is no negator up to two
words before w and ant, or there is such a
negator before both then
filter out this pair
3 Antonyms, Trends, Sentiment Polarity
Native speakers of a language are good at deter-
mining whether two words are antonyms (hot?cold,
ascend?descend, friend?foe) or not (penguin?clown,
cold?chilly, boat?rudder) (Cruse, 1986; Lehrer and
Lehrer, 1982; Deese, 1965). Strict antonyms apart,
there are also many word pairs that exhibit some de-
gree of contrast in meaning, for example, lukewarm?
cold, ascend?slip, and fan?enemy (Mohammad et
al., 2008). Automatically identifying such con-
trasting word pairs has many uses including detect-
ing and generating paraphrases (The lion caught
the gazel / The gazel could not escape the lion)
238
and detecting contradictions (Marneffe et al, 2008;
Voorhees, 2008) (The inhabitants of Peru are well
off / the inhabitants of Peru are poor). Of course,
such ?contradictions? may be a result of differing
sentiment, new information, non-coreferent men-
tions, or genuinely contradictory statements. Iden-
tifying paraphrases and contradictions are in turn
useful in effectively re-ranking target language hy-
potheses in machine translation, and for re-ranking
query responses in information retrieval. Identifying
contrasting word pairs (or short phrase pairs) is also
useful for detecting humor (Mihalcea and Strappar-
ava, 2005), as satire and jokes tend to have contra-
dictions and oxymorons. Lastly, it is useful to know
which words contrast a focal word, even if only to
filter them out. For example, in the automatic cre-
ation of a thesaurus it is necessary to distinguish
near-synonyms from contrasting word pairs. Distri-
butional similarity measures typically fail to do so.
Instances of strong contrast are recorded to some
extent in manually created dictionaries, but hun-
dreds of thousands of other contrasting pairs are not.
Further, antonyms can be of many kinds such as
those described in Section 3.1 below. We use the
Mohammad et al (2008) method to automatically
generate a large list of contrasting word pairs, which
are used to identify false paraphrases. Their method
is briefly described in Section 3.2.
3.1 Kinds of antonyms
Antonyms can be classified into different kinds.
A detailed description of one such classification can
be found in Cruse (1986) (Chapters 9, 10, and 11),
where the author describes complementaries (open?
shut, dead?alive), gradable adjective pairs (long?
short, slow?fast) (further classified into polar, over-
lapping, and equipollent antonyms), directional op-
posites (up?down, north?south), (further classified
into antipodals, counterparts, and reversives), re-
lational opposites (husband?wife, predator?prey),
indirect converses (give?receive, buy?pay), con-
gruence variants (huge?little, doctor?patient), and
pseudo opposites (black?white). It should be
noted, however, that even though contrasting word
pairs and antonyms have long been studied by
linguists, lexicographers, and others, experts do
not always agree on the scope of antonymy and
the kinds of contrasting word pairs. Some lex-
ical relations have also received attention at the
Educational Testing Services (ETS). They clas-
sify antonyms into contradictories (alive?dead,
masculine?feminine), contraries (old?young, happy-
sad), reverses (attack?defend, buy?sell), direction-
als (front?back, left?right), incompatibles (happy?
morbid, frank?hypocritical), asymmetric contraries
(hot?cool, dry?moist), pseudoantonyms (popular?
shy, right?bad), and defectives (default?payment,
limp?walk) (Bejar et al, 1991).
As mentioned earlier, in addition to antonyms,
there are other meaning-contrasting phenomena, or
other ways to classify them, such as contrasting
trends and sentiment polarity. They all may have
varying degrees of contrast in meaning. Hereafter
we sometime broadly refer to all of these as antony-
mous phrases. The antonymous phrase pair genera-
tion algorithm that we use here does not employ any
antonym-subclass-specific techniques.
3.2 Detecting antonyms
Mohammad et al (2008) used a Roget-like the-
saurus, co-occurrence statistics, and a seed set of
antonyms to identify the degree of antonymy be-
tween two words, and generate a list of antony-
mous words. The thesaurus divides the vocabulary
into about a thousand coarse categories. Each cat-
egory has, on average, about a hundred closely re-
lated words. (A word with more than one sense,
is listed in more than one category.) Mohammad
et al first determine pairs of thesaurus categories
that are contrasting in meaning. A category pair
is said to be contrasting if it has a seed antonym
pair. A list of seed antonyms is compiled using 16
affix patterns such as X and unX (clear?unclear)
and X and disX (honest?dishonest). Once a con-
trasting category pair is identified, all the word pairs
across the two categories are considered to have con-
trasting meaning. The strength of co-occurrence
(as measured by pointwise mutual information) be-
tween two contrasting word pairs is taken to be the
degree of antonymy. This is based on the distri-
butional hypothesis of antonyms, which states that
antonymous pairs tend to co-occur in text more of-
ten than chance. Co-occurrence counts are made
from the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard,
2000). The approach attains more than 80% accu-
racy on GRE-style closest opposite questions.
239
3.3 Detecting negators
The General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al, 1966) has
11,788 words labeled with 182 categories of word
tags, such as positive and negative semantic orien-
tation, pleasure, pain, and so on.2 Two of the GI
categories, NOTLW and DECREAS, contain terms
that negate the meaning of what follows (Choi and
Cardie, 2008; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2005). These
terms (with limited added inflection variation) form
our list of negators.
4 Paraphrase-Augmented SMT
Augmenting the source side of SMT phrase tables
with paraphrases of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) items
was introduced by Callison-Burch et al (2006),
and was adopted practically ?as-is? in consequent
work (Callison-Burch, 2008; Marton et al, 2009;
Marton, 2010). Given an OOV source-side phrase
f , if the translation model has a rule ?f ?, e? whose
source side is a paraphrase f ? of f , then a new rule
?f, e? is added, with an extra weighted log-linear
feature, whose value for the new rule is the similar-
ity score between f and f ? (computed as a function
of the pivot translation probabilities or the distribu-
tional semantic distance of the respective DPs). We
follow the same line here:
h(e, f) =
?
???????
???????
asim(DPf ? , If phrase table entry (e, f)
DPf ) is generated from (e, f ?)
using monolingually-
derived paraphrases.
1 Otherwise.
(1)
where the definition of asim is repeated below. As
noted in that previous work, it is possible to con-
struct a new translation rule from f to e via more
than one pair of source-side phrase and its para-
phrase; e.g., if f1 is a paraphrase of f , and so is f2,
and both f1, f2 translate to the same e, then both lead
to the construction of the new rule translating f to e,
but with potentially different feature scores. In order
to leverage on these paths and resolve feature value
conflicts, an aggregated similarity measure was ap-
plied: For each paraphrase f of source-side phrases

fi with similarity scores sim(fi, f),
asimi = asimi?1+(1?asimi?1) sim(fi, f) (2)
where asim0 = 0. We only augment the phrase
table with a single rule from f to e, and in it are the
feature values of the phrase fi for which sim(fi, f)
was the highest.
5 Experiment
5.1 System and Parameters
We augmented translation models with para-
phrases based on distributional semantic distance
measures, with our novel antonym-filtering, and
without it. We tested all models in English-
to-Chinese and English-to-Arabic translation, aug-
menting the models with translation rules for un-
known English phrases. We also contrasted these
models with non-augmented baseline models.
For baseline we used the phrase-based SMT sys-
tem Moses (Koehn et al, 2007), with the default
model features: 1. phrase translation probability,
2. reverse phrase translation probability, 3. lexical
translation probability, 4. reverse lexical translation
probability, 5. word penalty, 6. phrase penalty, 7. six
lexicalized reordering features, 8. distortion cost,
and 9. language model (LM) probability. We used
Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) for word alignment.
All features were weighted in a log-linear frame-
work (Och and Ney, 2002). Feature weights were
set with minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on
a tuning set using BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) as the
objective function. Test results were evaluated using
BLEU and TER (Snover et al, 2006): The higher
the BLEU score, the better the result; the lower the
TER score, the better the result. This is denoted
with BLEU? and TER? in Table 1. Statistical signif-
icance of model output differences was determined
using Koehn (2004)?s test on the objective function
(BLEU).
The paraphrase-augmented models were created
as described in Section 4. We used the same data
and parameter settings as in Marton (2010).3 We
used cosine distance over DPs of log-likelihood ra-
tios (McDonald, 2000), built with a sliding win-

from those used in Marton et al (2009) and Marton (2010), and
hence scores are not exactly the same across these publications.

dow of size ?6, a sampling threshold of 10000 oc-
currences, and a maximal paraphrase length of 6
tokens. We applied a paraphrase score threshold
t = 0.05; a dynamic context length (the short-
est non-stoplisted left context L occurring less than
512 times in the corpus, and similarly for R); para-
phrasing of OOV unigrams; filtering paraphrase can-
didates occurring less than 25 times in the corpus
(inspired by McDonald, 2000); and allowing up to
k = 100 best paraphrases per phrase. We tuned
the weights of each model (non-augmented base-
line, unigram-augmented, and unigram-augmented-
filtered) with a separate minimum error rate training.
We explored here augmenting OOV unigrams,
although our paraphrasing and antonym filtering
methods can be applied to longer n-grams with no
further modifications. However, preliminary experi-
ments showed that longer n-grams require additional
provisions in order to yield gains.
5.2 Data
In order to take advantage of the English antonym
resource, we chose English as the source language
for the translation task. We chose Chinese as
the translation target language in order to compare
with Marton (2010), and for the same reasons it was
chosen there: It is quite different from English (e.g.,
in word order), and four reference translation were
available from NIST. We chose Arabic as another
target language, because it is different from both
English and Chinese, and richer morphologically,
which introduces additional challenges.
English-Chinese: For training we used the
LDC Sinorama and FBIS tests (LDC2005T10 and
LDC2003E14), and segmented the Chinese side
with the Stanford Segmenter (Tseng et al, 2005).
After tokenization and filtering, this bitext contained
231,586 lines (6.4M + 5.1M tokens). We trained a
trigram language model on the Chinese side, with
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), using the mod-
ified Kneser-Ney smoothing option. We followed
the split in Marton (2010), and constructed the re-
duced set of about 29,000 sentence pairs. The pur-
pose of creating this subset model was to simulate a
resource-poor language. We trained separate trans-
lation models, using either the subset or the full-size
training dataset.
For weight tuning we used the Chinese-English
NIST MT 2005 evaluation set. In order to use it for
the reverse translation direction (English-Chinese),
we arbitrarily chose the first English reference set
as the tuning ?source?, and the Chinese source as a
single ?reference translation?. For testing we used
the English-Chinese NIST MT evaluation 2008 test
set with its four reference translations.
English-Arabic: We use an English-Arabic par-
allel corpus of about 135k sentences (4 million
words) and a subset of 30K sentences (one mil-
lion words) for the translation models? training data.
The sentences were extracted from Arabic News
(LDC2004T17), eTIRR (LDC2004E72), English
translation of Arabic Treebank (LDC2005E46),
and Ummah (LDC2004T18).4 For Arabic pre-
processing, we follow previously reported best to-
kenization scheme (TB)5 and orthographic word
normalization condition (Reduced) when translat-
ing from English to Arabic (El Kholy and Habash,
2010b). MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) is
used to pre-process the Arabic text for the translation
model and 5-gram language model (LM). As a post-
processing step, we jointly denormalize and deto-
kenize the text to produce the final Arabic output.
Following El Kholy and Habash (2010a), we use
their best detokenization technique, T+R+LM. The
technique crucially utilizes a lookup table (T), map-
ping tokenized forms to detokenized forms, based
on our MADA-fied LM. Alternatives are given con-
ditional probabilities, P (detokenized|tokenized).
Tokenized words absent from the tables are deto-
kenized using deterministic rules (R), as a backoff
strategy. We use a 5-gram untokenized LM and
the disambig utility in the SRILM toolkit to de-
cide among different alternatives. Word alignment
is done using GIZA++, as in English-Chinese sys-
tem. We use lemma-based alignment which consis-
tently yields superior results to surface-based align-
ment (El Kholy and Habash, 2010b). For LM, we
use 200M words from the Arabic Gigaword Corpus
(LDC2007T40) together with the Arabic side of our
training data.
All experiments were conducted using Moses
here as well. We used a maximum phrase length

of size 8 tokens. Weight optimization was done us-
ing a set of 300 sentences from the NIST MT 2004
Arabic-English evaluation test set (MT04). The tun-
ing was based on tokenized Arabic without detok-
enization. Testing was done on the NIST Arabic-
English MT05 and MEDAR 2010 English-Arabic
four-reference evaluation sets. For both tuning on
MT04 and testing on MT05, since we need the re-
verse English-Arabic direction, we chose one En-
glish reference translation as the ?source?, and the
Arabic as a single ?reference?. We evaluated using
BLEU and TER here too.
English paraphrases: We augmented the base-
line models with paraphrases generated as described
above, using a monolingual text of over 516M to-
kens, consisting of the BNC and English Gigaword
documents from 2004 and 2008 (LDC2009T13),
pre-processed to remove punctuation and to conflate
numbers, dates, months, days of week, and alphanu-
meric tokens to their respective classes.
5.3 Results
English-Chinese: Results are given in Table 1.
Augmenting SMT phrase tables with paraphrases of
OOV unigrams resulted in gains of 0.6-0.7 BLEU
points for both subset and full models, but TER
scores were worse (higher) for the full model. Aug-
menting same models with same paraphrases filtered
for antonyms resulted in further gains of 1.6 and 1
BLEU points for both subset and full models, respec-
tively, relative to the respective baselines. The TER
scores of the antonym filtered models were also as
good or better (lower) than those of the baselines.

of the scores showed higher or same gains. Since
only one entry was antonym-filtered here, we do
not provide separate scores for aug-1gram-ant-filt.
Surprisingly, for the reduced 30k models, all scores
(BLEU, TER, and even their lemmatized variants) of
the augmented 1gram model were somewhat worse
than the baseline?s, and those of the antonym-filtered
model were the worst. we also ran a 4-reference test
(Medar) to see whether the single MT05 reference
was problematic, but results were similar. We exam-
ine possible reasons for this in the next section.
6 Discussion
Filtering quality: Our filtering technique is based
on antonymous pair and negator lists that were ex-
panded distributionally from seed sets. Therefore,
they are noisy. From a small random sample (Ta-
ble 3) it seems that only about 10% of filtered cases
should not have been filtered; of the rest, 50% were
strongly antonymous, 25% mildly so, and 15% were
siblings (co-hypernyms) in a natural categorical hi-
erarchy or otherwise noisy paraphrases filtered due
to a noisy antonym pair. Negators in the unigrams?
paraphrase candidates were rare.
English-Chinese: Our paraphrase filtering tech-
nique yielded an additional 1 BLEU point gain
over the non-filtered paraphrase-augmented reduced
model (totaling 1.6 BLEU over baseline). The re-
duced and large augmented models? phrase table
size increased by about 27% and 4%, respectively ?
and antonym filtering did not change these numbers
by much (see left side of Table 4). Therefore, the dif-
ference in performance between the filtered and non-
filtered systems is unlikely to be quantitative (phrase
table size). The out of vocabulary (OOV) rate of the
29k subset model is somewhat high (see Table 4),
especially for the test set; but only after these exper-
iments were completed did we peek at the test set
for calculating these statistics, and in any case, we
should not be guided by such information in choos-
ing the test set. At first glance it may seem surpris-
ing that only 0.4% of the paraphrase candidates of
the English OOV unigrams (248 candidates) were
filtered by our procedure, and that it accounted for
as much as 1 BLEU in the reduced set. (For English-
Arabic only 0.6%, or 23 candidates, were filtered).
Leaving the estimation of antonymous phrase detec-
tion recall for the future, we note that these num-

bers from English are not directly comparable to the
Chinese side: they relate to paraphrase candidates
and not phrase table entries; they relate to types and
not tokens; each OOV English word may translate
to one or more Chinese words, each of which may
comprise of one or more characters; and last but not
least, the BLEU score we use is character-based.

Table 3: Random filtering examples
While individual unigram to 4gram scores for the
augmented models were lower than the baseline?s,
filtered model?s unigram and bigram scores were
lower or similar to the baseline?s, and their trigram
and 4gram scores were higher than the baseline?s.
We intend to further investigate the cause for this
pattern, and its effect on translation quality, with the
help of a native Chinese speaker ? and on BLEU, to-
gether with the brevity penalty ? in the future.
English-Arabic: The most striking fact is the set of
differences between the language pairs: In English-
Chinese, we see gains with distributional paraphrase
augmentation, and further gains when antonymous
and contrasting paraphrase candidates are filtered
out. But in the 30k-sentence English-Arabic models,
paraphrase augmentation actually degrades perfor-
mance, even in lemma scores. It has been observed
before that BLEU (and similarly TER) is not ideal
for evaluation of contributions of this sort (Callison-
Burch et al, 2006). Therefore we conducted both
manual and focused automatic analysis, including
OOV statistics and unigram lemma match analysis6
6Unigram lemma match analysis is a classification of all the
words in the translation hypothesis (against the translation ref-
erence) into: (a) exact match, which is equal to simple unigram
precision, (b) lemma-only match, which counts words that can
only be matched at the lemma level, and (c) unmatchable.

between the system output and the reference trans-
lation.
Table 4 shows that the OOV rates for English-
Arabic are lower than English-Chinese. But if they
were negligible, we would not expect to see gains
(or in fact any change) in either model size, contrary
to fact. It is interesting to point out that our trans-
lation model augmentation technique handles about
50% of the (non-digit, non-punctuation) OOV words
in all models (except for only half that in the 135k
model, which still showed gains).
Another concern is that the current maximal para-
phrase length (6 tokens) may be too far from the
paraphrasee?s length (unigram), resulting in lower
quality. However, a closer examination of the
length difference evident through the BLEU brevity
penalty and the reference:system-output length ra-
tio (columns 4-5 of Table 2), reveals that the dif-
ferences are small and inconsistent; on average, the
brevity penalty difference accounts for roughly 0.1
absolute BLEU points and 0.2 absolute lemmatized
BLEU points of the respective differences.7
Last, Modern Standard Arabic is a morphologi-
cally rich language: It has many inflected forms for
most verbs, and several inflected forms for nouns,
adjectives and other parts of speech ? and complex
syntactic agreement patterns showing these inflec-
tions. It might be the case that the inflected Arabic
LM model might not serve well the augmented mod-
els, since they include translation rules that are more
likely to be ?off? inflection-wise (e.g., showing un-
grammatical syntactic agreement or simply an ac-
ceptable choice that differs from the reference). Pre-
sumably, the smaller the training set, the larger this
problem, since there would be fewer rules and hence
smaller variety of inflected forms per similar core
meaning. The unigram lemma match analysis and
lemma scores? statistics (Table 2) support this con-
cern. In the 30k model, lemma-only match seems
to even further increase, at the expense of the exact
word-form match. Possible solutions include using
a lemma-based LM, or another LM that is adjusted
to this sort of inflection-wise ?off? text.
7These values are computed by subtracting the difference
between two BLEU scores from the difference between the same
two BLEU scores without the effect of brevity penalty (i.e., each
divided by its brevity penalty).
Error Analysis We conducted an error analysis of
our Arabic 30k system using part of the MT05 test
set. That set had 571 OOV types, out of which,
we were able to augment phrases for 196 OOV
types. The majority of OOV words were proper
nouns (67.8%), with the rest being mostly nouns, ad-
jectives and verbs (in the order of their frequency).
Among the OOVs for which we augmented phrases,
the proper noun ratio was smaller than the full set
(45.4% relative). We selected a random sample of
50 OOV words, and examined their translations in
the MT05 test set. The analysis considered all the
OOV word occurrences (96 sentences). We classi-
fied each OOV translation in the augmented system
and the augmented-filtered system as follows:
a1 correct (and in reference)
a2 correct (morphological variation)
a3 acceptable translation into a synonym
a4 acceptable translation into a hypernym
b1 wrong translation into a hypernym
b2 co-hypernym: a sibling in a psychologically
natural category hierarchy
b3 antonymous, trend-contrasting, or polarity dis-
similar meaning
c1 wrong proper-noun translation (sibling)
c2 wrong proper-noun translation (other)
d wrong translation for other reasons
Both the augmented and augmented-filtered system
had 27.1% correct cases (category a). Only one-
quarter of these were exact matches with the refer-
ence (category a1) that can be captured by BLEU.
Incorrect proper-noun translation (category c) was
the biggest error (augmented model: 33.3%, filtered
model: 37.5%); within this category, sibling mis-
translations (category c1), e.g., Buddhism is trans-
lated as Islam, were the majority (over half in aug-
mented model, and about two-thirds in the filtered
model). Proper nouns seem to be a much bigger
problem for translation into Arabic than into Chi-
nese in our sets. Category b mis-translations ap-
peared in 20.8% of the time (equally in augmented
and filtered). Almost half of these were sibling mis-
translations (category b2), e.g., diamond translated
as gold. Only two OOV translations in our sam-
ple were antonymous (category b3). It is possible,
therefore, that our Arabic sets do not give room for
our filtering method to be effective. In one case,
the verb deepen (reference translation

???

K) is mis-
244
translated as summit (

??

?). In the other case, the
adjective cool (political relations), whose reference
translation uses a figure of speech periods of tension
(QK?J? @ 	?? H@Q


	
?), is mistranslated as good (

?YJ
k. ),
which carries the opposite sentiment. The rest of
category b involve hypernyms (b1), such as trans-
lating the OOV word telecom into company (

??Q??? @).
Overall, the filtered model did not behave signifi-
cantly differently from its augmented counterpart.
Chinese-Arabic score difference: We conjecture
that another possible reason for the different score
gain patterns between the two language pairs is the
fact that in Chinese, many words that are siblings-in-
meaning share a character, which doesn?t necessar-
ily have a stand-alone meaning; therefore, character-
based BLEU was able to give credit to such para-
phrases on the Chinese side, which was not case for
the word-based BLEU on the Arabic side.
7 Related Work
This paper brings together several sub-areas:
SMT, paraphrase generation, distributional seman-
tic distance measures, and antonym-related work.
Therefore we can only briefly survey the most rel-
evant work here. Our work can be viewed as an ex-
tension of the line of research that seeks to augment
translation tables with automatically generated para-
phrases of OOV words or phrases in a fashion sim-
ilar to Section 4: Callison-Burch et al (2006) use
pivoting technique (translating to other languages
and back) in order to generate paraphrases, and the
pivot translation probability as their similarity score;
Callison-Burch (2008) filters such paraphrases using
syntactic parsing information; Marton et al (2009)
use distributional paraphrasing technique that ap-
plies distributional semantic distance measure for
the paraphrase score; Marton (2010) applies a lexi-
cal resource / corpus-based hybrid semantic distance
measure for the paraphrase score instead, approxi-
mating word senses; here, we apply a distributional
semantic distance measure that is similar to Marton
et al (2009), with the main difference being the fil-
tering of the resulting paraphrases for antonymity.
Other work on augmentating SMT: Habash and
Hu (2009) show, pivoting via a trilingual parallel
text, that using English as a pivot language be-
tween Chinese and Arabic outperforms translation
using a direct Chinese-Arabic bilingual parallel text.
Other attempts to reduce the OOV rate by augment-
ing the phrase table?s source side include Habash
(2009), providing an online tool for paraphrasing
OOV phrases by lexical and morphological expan-
sion of known phrases and dictionary terms ? and
transliteration of proper names.
Bond et al (2008) also pivot for paraphrasing.
They improve SMT coverage by using a manually
crafted monolingual HPSG grammar for generating
meaning and grammar-preserving paraphrases. This
grammar allows for certain word reordering, lexical
substitutions, contractions, and ?typo? corrections.
Onishi et al (2010), Du et al (2010), and others,
pivot-paraphrase the input, and represent the para-
phrases in a lattice format, decoding it with Moses.
Work on paraphrase generation: Barzilay and
McKeown (2001) extract paraphrases from a mono-
lingual parallel corpus, containing multiple transla-
tions of the same source. However, monolingual
parallel corpora are extremely rare and small. Dolan
et al (2004) use edit distance for paraphrasing.
Max (2009) and others take the context of the para-
phrased word?s occurrence into account. Zhao et al
(2008) apply SMT-style decoding for paraphrasing,
using several log linear weighted resources while
Zhao et al (2009) filter out paraphrase candidates
and weight paraphrase features according to the de-
sired NLP task. Chevelu et al (2009) introduce
a new paraphrase generation tool based on Monte-
Carlo sampling. Mirkin et al (2009), inter alia,
frame paraphrasing as a special, symmetrical case of
(WordNet-based) textual entailment. See Madnani
and Dorr (2010) for a good paraphrasing survey.
Work on measuring distributional semantic dis-
tance: For one survey of this rich topic, see Weeds
et al (2004) and Turney and Pantel (2010). We
use here cosine of log-likelihood ratios (McDonald,
2000). A recent paper (Kazama et al, 2010) advo-
cates a Bayesian approach, making rare terms have
lower strength of association, as a by-product of re-
lying on their probabilistic Expectation.
Work on detecting antonyms: Our work with
antonyms can be thought of as an application-based
extension of the (Mohammad et al, 2008) method.
Some of the earliest computational work in this
area is by Lin et al (2003) who used patterns

such as ?from X to Y ? and ?either X or Y ? to
distinguish between antonymous and similar word
pairs. Harabagiu et al (2006) detected antonyms
by determining if their WordNet synsets are con-
nected by the hypernymy?hyponymy links and ex-
actly one antonymy link. Turney (2008) proposed a
supervised method to solve word analogy questions
that require identifying synonyms, antonyms, hyper-
nyms, and other lexical-semantic relations between
word pairs.
8 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented here a novel method for filtering out
antonymous phrasal paraphrase candidates, adapted
from sentiment analysis literature, and tested in sim-
ulated low- and mid-resourced SMT tasks from En-
glish to two quite different languages. We used an
antonymous word pair list extracted distributionally
by extending a seed list. Then, the extended list, to-
gether with a negator list and a novel heuristic, were
used to filter out antonymous paraphrase candidates.
Finally, SMT models were augmented with the fil-
tered paraphrases, yielding English-Chinese transla-
tion improvements of up to 1 BLEU from the corre-
sponding non-filtered paraphrase-augmented model
(up to 1.6 BLEU from the corresponding baseline
model). Our method proved effective for mod-
els trained on both reduced and mid-large English-
Chinese parallel texts. The reduced models sim-
ulated ?low density? languages by limiting the
amount of the training text.
We also showed for the first time transla-
tion gains for English-Arabic with paraphrase-
augmented (non-filtered) models. However, Ara-
bic, and presumably other morphologically rich lan-
guages, may require more complex models in order
to benefit from our filtering method.
Our antonym detection and filtering method is
distributional and heuristic-based; hence it is noisy.
We suspect that OOV terms in larger models tend
to be harder to paraphrase (judging by the differ-
ence from the reduced models, and the lower OOV
rate), and also harder to filter paraphrase candidates
of (due to the lower paraphrase quality, which might
not even include sufficiently distributionally similar
candidates, antonymous or otherwise). In the future,
we intend to improve our method, so that it can be
used to improve also the quality of models trained
on even larger parallel texts.
Last, we intend to extend our method beyond un-
igrams, limit paraphrase length to the vicinity of the
paraphrasee?s length, and improve our inflected Ara-
bic generation technique, so it can handle this novel
type of augmented data well.
