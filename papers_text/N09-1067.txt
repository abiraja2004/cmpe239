Abstract
We describe a statistical model over linguis-
tic areas and phylogeny. Our model recov-
ers known areas and identifies a plausible hi-
erarchy of areal features. The use of areas
improves genetic reconstruction of languages
both qualitatively and quantitatively according
to a variety of metrics. We model linguistic
areas by a Pitman-Yor process and linguistic
phylogeny by Kingman?s coalescent.
1 Introduction
Why are some languages more alike than others?
This question is one of the most central issues in his-
torical linguistics. Typically, one of three answers
is given (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2001; Campbell,
2006). First, the languages may be related ?genet-
ically.? That is, they may have all derived from a
common ancestor language. Second, the similarities
may be due to chance. Some language properties
are simply more common than others, which is of-
ten attributed to be mostly due to linguistic univer-
sals (Greenberg, 1963). Third, the languages may
be related areally. Languages that occupy the same
geographic area often exhibit similar characteristics,
not due to genetic relatedness, but due to sharing.
Regions (and the languages contained within them)
that exhibit sharing are called linguistic areas and
the features that are shared are called areal features.
Much is not understood or agreed upon in the field
of areal linguistics. Different linguists favor differ-
ent defintions of what it means to be a linguistic area
(are two languages sufficient to describe an area or
do you need three (Thomason, 2001; Katz, 1975)?),
what areal features are (is there a linear ordering of
?borrowability? (Katz, 1975; Curnow, 2001) or is
that too prescriptive?), and what causes sharing to
take place (does social status or number of speakers
play a role (Thomason, 2001)?).
In this paper, we attempt to provide a statistical
answer to some of these questions. In particular,
we develop a Bayesian model of typology that al-
lows for, but does not force, the existence of linguis-
tic areas. Our model also allows for, but does not
force, preference for some feature to be shared are-
ally. When applied to a large typological database
of linguistic features (Haspelmath et al, 2005), we
find that it discovers linguistic areas that are well
documented in the literature (see Campbell (2005)
for an overview), and a small preference for cer-
tain features to be shared areally. This latter agrees,
to a lesser degree, with some of the published hi-
erarchies of borrowability (Curnow, 2001). Finally,
we show that reconstructing language family trees is
significantly aided by knowledge of areal features.
We note that Warnow et al (2005) have indepen-
dently proposed a model for phonological change in
Indo-European (based on the Dyen dataset (Dyen et
al., 1992)) that includes notions of borrowing. Our
model is different in that we (a) base our model on
typological features rather than just lexical patterns
and (b) we explicitly represent language areas, not
just one-time borrowing phenomena.
2 Background
We describe (in Section 3) a non-parametric, hier-
archical Bayesian model for finding linguistic areas
and areal features. In this section, we provide nec-
essary background?both linguistic and statistical?
593
for understanding our model.
2.1 Areal Linguistics
Areal effects on linguistic typology have been stud-
ied since, at least, the late 1920s by Trubetzkoy,
though the idea of tracing family trees for languages
goes back to the mid 1800s and the comparative
study of historical linguistics dates back, perhaps to
Giraldus Cambrenis in 1194 (Campbell, In press).
A recent article provides a short introduction to both
the issues that surround areal linguistics, as well as
an enumeration of many of the known language ar-
eas (Campbell, 2005). A fairly wide, modern treat-
ment of the issues surrounding areal diffusion is also
given by essays in a recent book edited by Aikhen-
vald and Dixon (2001). The essays in this book pro-
vide a good introduction to the issues in the field.
Campbell (2006) provides a critical survey of these
and other hypotheses relating to areal linguistics.
There are several issues which are basic to the
study of areal linguistics (these are copied almost
directly from Campbell (2006)). Must a linguistic
area comprise more than two languages? Must it
comprise more than one language family? Is a sin-
gle trait sufficient to define an area? How ?nearby?
must languages in an area be to one another? Are
some feature more easily borrowed that others?
Despite these formal definitional issues of what
constitutes a language area and areal features, most
historical linguists seem to believe that areal effects
play some role in the change of languages.
2.1.1 Established Linguistic Areas
Below, we list some of the well-known linguistic
areas; Campbell (2005) provides are more complete
listing together with example areal features for these
areas. For each area, we list associated languages:
The Balkans: Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Mace-
donian, Rumanian and Serbo-Croatian. (Sometimes:
Romani and Turkish)
South Asian: Languages belonging to the Dravid-
ian, Indo-Aryan, Munda, Tibeto-Burman families.
Meso-America: Cuitlatec, Huave, Mayan, Mixe-
Zoquean, Nahua, Otomanguean, Tarascan, Tequist-
latecan, Totonacan and Xincan.
North-west America: Alsea, Chimakuan, Coosan,
Eyak, Haida, Kalapuyan, Lower Chinook, Salishan,
Takelman, Tlingit, Tsimshian and Wakashan.
The Baltic: Baltic languages, Baltic German, and
Finnic languages (especially Estonian and Livo-
nian). (Sometimes many more are included, such as:
Belorussian, Lavian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Old
Prussian, Polish, Romani, Russian, Ukranian.)
Ethiopia: Afar, Amharic, Anyuak, Awngi, Beja,
Ge?ez, Gumuz, Janjero, Kefa, Sidamo, Somali, Ti-
gre, Tigrinya and Wellamo.
Needless to say, the exact definition and extent of
the actual areas is up to significant debate. More-
over, claims have been made in favor of many lin-
guistic areas not defined above. For instance, Dixon
(2001) presents arguments for several Australian lin-
guistic areas and Matisoff (2001) defines a South-
East Asian language area. Finally, although ?folk
lore? is in favor of identifying a linguistic area in-
cluding English, French and certain Norse languages
(Norwegian, Swedish, Low Dutch, High German,
etc.), there are counter-arguments to this position
(Thomason, 2001) (see especially Case Study 9.8).
2.1.2 Linguistic Features
Identifying which linguistic features are most eas-
ily shared ?areally? is a long standing problem in
contact linguistics. Here we briefly review some of
the major claims. Much of this overview is adoped
from the summary given by Curnow (2001).
Haugen (1950) considers only borrowability as
far as the lexicon is concerned. He provided evi-
dence that nouns are the easiest, followed by verbs,
adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc. Ross (1988)
corroborates Haugen?s analysis and deepens it to
cover morphology, syntax and phonology. He pro-
poses the following hierarchy of borrowability (eas-
iest items coming first): nouns > verbs > adjectives
> syntax > non-bound function words > bound
morphemes > phonemes. Coming from a ?con-
straints? perspective, Moravcsik (1978) suggests
that: lexical items must be borrowed before lexi-
cal properties; inflected words before bound mor-
phemes; verbal items can never be borrowed; etc.
Curnow (2001) argues that coming up with a rea-
sonable hierarchy of borrowability is that ?we may
never be able to develop such constraints.? Never-
theless, he divides the space of borrowable features
into 15 categories and discusses the evidence sup-
porting each of these categories, including: phonet-
ics (rare), phonology (common), lexical (very com-
mon), interjections and discourse markers (com-
594
mon), free grammatical forms (occasional), bound
grammatical forms (rare), position of morphology
(rare), syntactic frames (rare), clause-internal syntax
(common), between-clause syntax (occasional).
2.2 Non-parametric Bayesian Models
We treat the problem of understanding areal linguis-
tics as a statistical question, based on a database of
typological information. Due to the issues raised in
the previous section, we do not want to commit to
the existence of a particular number of linguistic ar-
eas, or particular sizes thereof. (Indeed, we do not
even want to commit to the existence of any linguis-
tic areas.) However, we will need to ?unify? the
languages that fall into a linguistic area (if such a
thing exists) by means of some statistical param-
eter. Such problems have been studied under the
name non-parametric models. The idea behind non-
parametric models is that one does not commit a pri-
ori to a particularly number of parameters. Instead,
we allow the data to dictate how many parameters
there are. In Bayesian modeling, non-parametric
distributions are typically used as priors; see Jor-
dan (2005) or Ghahramani (2005) for overviews. In
our model, we use two different non-parametric pri-
ors: the Pitman-Yor process (for modeling linguistic
areas) and Kingman?s coalescent (for modeling lin-
guistic phylogeny), both described below.
2.2.1 The Pitman-Yor Process
One particular example of a non-parametric prior
is the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997),
which can be seen as an extension to the better-
known Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1974). The
Pitman-Yor process can be understood as a particu-
lar example of a Chinese Restaurant process (CRP)
(Pitman, 2002). The idea in all CRPs is that there
exists a restaurant with an infinite number of ta-
bles. Customers come into the restaurant and have
to choose a table at which to sit.
The Pitman-Yor process is described by three pa-
rameters: a base rate ?, a discount parameter d and
a mean distribution G0. These combine to describe
a process denoted by PY(?, d,G0). The parameters
? and d must satisfy: 0 ? d < 1 and ? > ?d. In
the CRP analogy, the model works as follows. The
first customer comes in and sits at any table. After
N customers have come in and seated themselves
(at a total of K tables), the N th customer arrives. In
the Pitman-Yor process, the N th customer sits at a
new table with probability proportional to ? + Kd
and sits at a previously occupied table k with proba-
bility proportional to #k ? d, where #k is the num-
ber of customers already seated at table k. Finally,
with each table k we associate a parameter ?k, with
each ?k drawn independently from G0. An impor-
tant property of the Pitman-Yor process is that draws
from it are exchangable: perhaps counterintuitively,
the distribution does not care about customer order.
The Pitman-Yor process induces a power-law dis-
tribution on the number of singleton tables (i.e., the
number of tables that have only one customer). This
can be seen by noticing two things. In general,
the number of singleton tables grows as O(?Nd).
When d = 0, we obtain a Dirichlet process with the
number of singleton tables growing as O(? logN).
2.2.2 Kingman?s Coalescent
Kingman?s coalescent is a standard model in pop-
ulation genetics describing the common genealogy
(ancestral tree) of a set of individuals (Kingman,
1982b; Kingman, 1982a). In its full form it is a dis-
tribution over the genealogy of a countable set.
Consider the genealogy of n individuals alive at
the present time t = 0. We can trace their ances-
try backwards in time to the distant past t = ??.
Assume each individual has one parent (in genet-
ics, haploid organisms), and therefore genealogies
of [n] = {1, . . . , n} form a directed forest. King-
man?s n-coalescent is simply a distribution over ge-
nealogies of n individuals. To describe the Markov
process in its entirety, it is sufficient to describe
the jump process (i.e. the embedded, discrete-time,
Markov chain over partitions) and the distribution
over coalescent times. In the n-coalescent, every
pair of lineages merges independently with rate 1,
with parents chosen uniformly at random from the
set of possible parents at the previous time step.
The n-coalescent has some interesting statistical
properties (Kingman, 1982b; Kingman, 1982a). The
marginal distribution over tree topologies is uni-
form and independent of the coalescent times. Sec-
ondly, it is infinitely exchangeable: given a geneal-
ogy drawn from an n-coalescent, the genealogy of
any m contemporary individuals alive at time t? 0
embedded within the genealogy is a draw from the
m-coalescent. Thus, taking n??, there is a distri-
595
bution over genealogies of a countably infinite pop-
ulation for which the marginal distribution of the ge-
nealogy of any n individuals gives the n-coalescent.
Kingman called this the coalescent.
Teh et al (2007) recently described efficient in-
ference algorithms for Kingman?s coalescent. They
applied the coalescent to the problem of recovering
linguistic phylogenies. The application was largely
successful?at least in comparison to alternative al-
gorithms that use the same data-. Unfortunately,
even in the results they present, one can see signif-
icant areal effects. For instance, in their Figure(3a),
Romanian is very near Albanian and Bulgarian. This
is likely an areal effect: specifically, an effect due to
the Balkan langauge area. We will revisit this issue
in our own experiments.
3 A Bayesian Model for Areal Linguistics
We will consider a data set consisting of N lan-
guages and F typological features. We denote the
value of feature f in language n as Xn,f . For sim-
plicity of exposition, we will assume two things: (1)
there is no unobserved data and (2) all features are
binary. In practice, for the data we use (described in
Section 4), neither of these is true. However, both
extensions are straightforward.
When we construct our model, we attempt to be
as neutral to the ?areal linguistics? questions defined
in Section 2.1 as possible. We allow areas with only
two languages (though for brevity we do not present
them in the results). We allow areas with only one
family (though, again, do not present them). We are
generous with our notion of locality, allowing a ra-
dius of 1000 kilometers (though see Section 5.4 for
an analysis of the effect of radius).1 And we allow,
but do not enforce trait weights. All of this is ac-
complished through the construction of the model
and the choice of the model hyperparameters.
At a high-level, our model works as follows. Val-
ues Xn,f appear for one of two reasons: they are ei-
ther areally derived or genetically derived. A latent
variable Zn,f determines this. If it is derived areally,
then the value Xn,f is drawn from a latent variable
1An reader might worry about exchangeability: Our method
of making language centers and locations part of the Pitman-Yor
distribution ensures this is not an issue. An alternative would
be to use a location-sensitive process such as the kernel stick-
breaking process (Dunson and Park, 2007), though we do not
explore that here.
corresponding to the value preferences in the lan-
gauge area to which language n belongs. If it is de-
rived genetically, thenXn,f is drawn from a variable
corresponding to value preferences for the genetic
substrate to which language n belongs. The set of
areas, and the area to which a language belongs are
given by yet more latent variables. It is this aspect of
the model for which we use the Pitman-Yor process:
languages are customers, areas are tables and area
value preferences are the parameters of the tables.
3.1 The formal model
We assume that the value a feature takes for a par-
ticular language (i.e., the value of Xn,f ) can be ex-
plained either genetically or areally.2 We denote this
by a binary indicator variable Zn,f , where a value 1
means ?areal? and a value 0 means ?genetic.? We as-
sume that each Zn,f is drawn from a feature-specific
binomial parameter pif . By having the parameter
feature-specific, we express the fact that some fea-
tures may be more or less likely to be shared than
others. In other words, a high value of pif would
mean that feature f is easily shared areally, while a
low value would mean that feature f is hard to share.
Each language n has a known latitude/longitude `n.
We further assume that there are K linguistic ar-
eas, whereK is treated non-parametrically by means
of the Pitman-Yor process. Note that in our context,
a linguistic area may contain only one language,
which would technically not be allowed according
to the linguistic definition. When a language belongs
to a singleton area, we interpret this to mean that it
does not belong to any language area.
Each language area k (including the singleton ar-
eas) has a set of F associated parameters ?k,f , where
?k,f is the probability that feature f is ?on? in area k.
It also has a ?central location? given by a longitude
and latitude denoted ck. We only allow languages
to belong to areas that fall within a given radius R
of them (distances computed according to geodesic
distance). This accounts for the ?geographical? con-
straints on language areas. We denote the area to
which language n belongs as an.
We assume that each language belongs to a ?fam-
ily tree.? We denote the parent of language n in the

is possible: chance. We treat ?chance? as noise and model it in
the data generation process, not as an alternative ?source.?

family tree by pn. We associate with each node i in
the family tree and each feature f a parameter ?i,f .
As in the areal case, ?i,f is the probability that fea-
ture f is on for languages that descend from node i
in the family tree. We model genetic trees by King-
man?s coalescent with binomial mutation.
Finally, we put non-informative priors on all the
hyperparameters. Written hierarchically, our model
has the following shown in Figure 1. There, by
(p, ?) ? Coalescent(pi0,m0), we mean that the tree
and parameters are given by a coalescent.
3.2 Inference
Inference in our model is mostly by Gibbs sam-
pling. Most of the distributions used are conju-
gate, so Gibbs sampling can be implemented effi-
ciently. The only exceptions are: (1) the coales-
cent for which we use the GreedyRate1 algorithm
described by Teh et al (2007); (2) the area centers c,
for which we using a Metropolis-Hastings step. Our
proposal distribution is a Gaussian centered at the
previous center, with standard deviation of 5. Ex-
perimentally, this resulted in an acceptance rate of
about 50%.
In our implementation, we analytically integrate
out pi and ? and sample only over Z, the coalescent
tree, and the area assignments. In some of our ex-
periments, we treat the family tree as given. In this
case, we also analytically integrate out the ? param-
eters and sample only over Z and area assignments.
4 Typological Data
The database on which we perform our analysis is
the World Atlas of Language Structures (henceforth,
WALS) (Haspelmath et al, 2005). The database
contains information about 2150 languages (sam-
pled from across the world). There are 139 typologi-
cal features in this database. The database is sparse:
only 16% of the possible language/feature pairs are
known. We use the version extracted and prepro-
cessed by Daume? III and Campbell (2007).
In WALS, languages a grouped into 38 language
families (including Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic,
Austronesian, Niger-Congo, etc.). Each of these lan-
guage families is grouped into a number of language
geni. The Indo-European family includes ten geni,
including: Germanic, Romance, Indic and Slavic.
The Austronesian family includes seventeen geni,
including: Borneo, Oceanic, Palauan and Sundic.
Overall, there are 275 geni represented in WALS.
We further preprocess the data as follows. For
the Indo-European subset (hence-forth, ?IE?), we re-
move all languages with ? 10 known features and
then remove all features that appear in at most 1/4
of the languages. This leads to 73 languages and
87 features. For the whole-world subset, we remove
languages with ? 25 known features and then fea-
tures that appear in at most 1/10 of the languages.
This leads to 349 languages and 129 features.
5 Experiments
5.1 Identifying Language Areas
Our first experiment is aimed at discovering lan-
guage areas. We first focus on the IE family, and
then extend the analysis to all languages. In both
cases, we use a known family tree (for the IE ex-
periment, we use a tree given by the language genus
structure; for the whole-world experiment, we use a
tree given by the language family structure). We run
each experiment with five random restarts and 2000
iterations. We select the MAP configuration from
the combination of these runs.
In the IE experiment, the model identified the
areas shown in Figure 5.1. The best area identi-
fied by our model is the second one listed, which
clearly correlates highly with the Balkans. There
are two areas identified by our model (the first and
last) that include only Indic and Iranian languages.
While we are not aware of previous studies of these
as linguistic areas, they are not implausible given

the history of the region. The fourth area identi-
fied by our model corresponds roughly to the de-
bated ?English? area. Our area includes the req-
uisite French/English/German/Norwegian group, as
well as the somewhat surprising Irish. However, in
addition to being intuitively plausible, it is not hard
to find evidence in the literature for the contact re-
lationship between English and Irish (Sommerfelt,
1960).
In the whole-world experiment, the model identi-
fied too many linguistic areas to fit (39 in total that
contained at least two languages, and contained at
least two language families). In Figure 5.1, we de-
pict the areas found by our model that best corre-
spond to the areas described in Section 2.1.1. We
acknowledge that this gives a warped sense of the
quality of our model. Nevertheless, our model is
able to identify large parts of the the Meso-American
area, the Baltic area and the South Asian area. (It
also finds the Balkans, but since these languages
are all IE, we do not consider it a linguistic area in
this evaluation.) While our model does find areas
that match Meso-American and North-west Ameri-
can areas, neither is represented in its entirety (ac-
cording to the definition of these areas given in Sec-

tion 2.1.1).
Despite the difficulty humans have in assigning
linguistic areas, In Table 1, we explicitly compare
the quality of the areal clusters found on the IE sub-
set. We compare against the most inclusive areal
lists from Section 2.1.1 for IE: the Balkans and the
Baltic. When there is overlap (eg., Romani appears
in both lists), we assigned it to the Balkans.
We compare our model with a flat Pitman-Yor
model that does not use the hierarchy. We also
compare to a baseline K-means algorithm. For K-
means, we ran with K ? {5, 10, 15, . . . , 80, 85}
and chose the value of K for each metric that did
best (giving an unfair advantage). Clustering per-
formance is measured on the Indo-European task
according to the Rand Index, F-score, Normalized
Edit Score (Pantel, 2003) and Normalized Variation
of Information (Meila, 2003). In these results, we
see that the Pitman-Yor process model dominates the
K-means model and the Areal model dominates the
Pitman-Yor model.
5.2 Identifying Areal Features
Our second experiment is an analysis of the features
that tend to be shared areally (as opposed to genet-
ically). For this experiment, we make use of the
whole-world version of the data, again with known
language family structure. We initialize a Gibbs
sampler from the MAP configuration found in Sec-
tion 5.1. We run the sampler for 1000 iterations and
take samples every ten steps.
From one particular sample, we can estimate a
posterior distribution over each pif . Due to con-
jugacy, we obtain a posterior distribution of pif ?
Bet(1 +?n Zn,f , 1 +
?
n[1?Zn,f ]). The 1s come
from the prior. From this Beta distribution, we can
ask the question: what is the probability that a value
of pif drawn from this distribution will have value
< 0.5? If this value is high, then the feature is likely

to be a ?genetic feature?; if it is low, then the feature
is likely to be an ?areal feature.? We average these
probabilities across all 100 samples.
The features that are most likely to be areal ac-
cording to our model are summaries in Table 2. In
this table, we list the categories to which each fea-
ture belongs, together with the number of features in
that category, and the average probability that a fea-
ture in that category is genetically transmitted. Ap-
parently, the vast majority of features are not areal.
We can treat the results presented in Table 2 as a
hierarchy of borrowability. In doing so, we see that
our hierarchy agrees to a large degree with the hier-
archies summarized in Section 2.1.2. Indeed, (aside
from ?Tea?, which we will ignore) the two most
easily shared categories according to our model are
phonology and the lexicon; this is in total agreement
with the agreed state of affairs in linguistics.
Lower in our list, we see that noun-related cat-
egories tend to precede their verb-related counter-
parts (nominal categories before verbal categores,
nominal syntax before complex sentences). Accord-
ing to Curnow (2001), the most difficult features to
borrow are phonetics (for which we have no data),
bound grammatical forms (which appear low on our
list), morphology (which is 99% genetic, according

5.3 Genetic Reconstruction
In this section, we investigate whether the use of
areal knowledge can improve the automatic recon-
struction of language family trees. We use King-
man?s coalescent (see Section 2.2.2) as a probabilis-
tic model of trees, endowed with a binomial muta-
tion process on the language features.
Our baseline model is to run the vanilla coalescent
on the WALS data, effective reproducing the results
presented by Teh et al (2007). This method was al-
ready shown to outperform competing hierarchical
clustering algorithms such as average-link agglom-
erative clustering (see, eg., Duda and Hart (1973))
and the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering algorithm
(Heller and Ghahramani, 2005).
We run the same experiment both on the IE sub-
set of data and on the whole-world subset. We eval-
uate the results qualitatively, by observing the trees
found (on the IE subset) and quantitatively (below).
For the qualitative analysis, we show the subset of
IE that does not contain Indic languages or Iranian
languages (just to keep the figures small). The tree
derived from the original data is on the left in Fig-
ure 4, below:
The tree based on areal information is on the right in
Figure 4, below. As we can see, the use of areal in-
formation qualitatively improves the structure of the
tree. Where the original tree had a number of errors
with respect to Romance and Germanic languages,
these are sorted out in the areally-aware tree. More-
over, Greek now appears in a more appropriate part
of the tree and English appears on a branch that is
further out from the Norse languages.
We perform two varieties of quantitative analysis.
In the first, we attempt to predict unknown feature
values. In particular, we hide an addition 10% of
the feature values in the WALS data and fit a model

to the remaining 90%. We then use that model to
predict the hidden 10%. The baseline model is to
make predictions according to the family tree. The
augmented model is to make predictions according
to the family tree for those features identified as ge-
netic and according to the linguistic area for those
features identified as areal. For both settings, we
compute both the absolute accuracy as well as the
log probability of the hidden data under the model
(the latter is less noisy). We repeat this experiment
10 times with a different random 10% hidden. The
results are shown in Table 3, below. The differences
are not large, but are outside one standard deviation.
For the second quantitative analysis, we use
present purity scores (Heller and Ghahramani,
2005), subtree scores (the number of interior nodes
with pure leaf labels, normalized) and leave-one-out
log accuracies (all scores are between 0 and 1, and
higher scores are better). These scores are computed
against both language family and language genus as
the ?classes.? The results are in Table 4, below. As
we can see, the results are generally in favor of the
Areal model (LOO Acc on IE versus Genus non-
withstanding), depending on the evaluation metric.

Table 5: Scores for IE vs genus at varying radii.
5.4 Effect of Radius
Finally, we evaluate the effect of the radius hyper-
parameter on performance. Table 5 shows perfor-
mance for models built with varying radii. As can
be seen by purity and subtree scores, there is a
?sweet spot? around 500 to 1000 kilometers where
the model seems optimal. LOO (strangely) seems
to continue to improve as we allow areas to grow
arbitrarily large. This is perhaps overfitting. Never-
theless, performance is robust for a range of radii.
6 Discussion
We presented a model that is able to recover well-
known linguistic areas. Using this areas, we have
shown improvement in the ability to recover phylo-
genetic trees of languages. It is important to note
that despite our successes, there is much at our
model does not account for: borrowing is known to
be assymetric; contact is temporal; borrowing must
obey univeral implications. Despite the failure of
our model to account for these issues, however, it
appears largely successful. Moreover, like any ?data
mining? expedition, our model suggests new lin-
guistic areas (particularly in the ?whole world? ex-
periments) that deserve consideration.
