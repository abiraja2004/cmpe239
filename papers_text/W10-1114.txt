Abstract
We explore the use of conditional random
fields (CRFs) to automatically extract impor-
tant metadata from clinical research articles.
These metadata fields include formulaic meta-
data about the authors, extracted from the title
page, as well as free text fields concerning the
study?s critical parameters, such as longitudi-
nal variables and medical intervention meth-
ods, extracted from the body text of the arti-
cle. Extracting such information can help both
readers conduct deep semantic search of arti-
cles and policy makers and sociologists track
macro level trends in research. Preliminary re-
sults show an acceptable level of performance
for formulaic metadata and a high precision
for those found in the free text.
1 Introduction
The increasing number of clinical research articles
published each year is a double-edged sword. As
of 2009, PubMed indexed over 19 million citations,
over which 700,000 were added over the previous
year1. While the research results further our knowl-
edge and competency in the field, the volume of in-
formation poses a challenge to researchers who need
to stay up to speed. Even within a single clinical
research area, there can be hundreds of new clini-
cal research results per year. Policy makers, who
need to decide which clinical research proposals to
fund and fast-track, and which proposals could tag
onto existing research and cost share, have equally
daunting information synthesis issues that have both
monetary and public health implications (Johnston
et al, 2006).

Systematic reviews ? secondary publications that
compile evidence and best practices from primary
research results ? partially address these concerns,
but can take years before their final publication, due
to liability and administrative overheads. In many
fast-paced fields of clinical practice, such guidelines
can be outdated by the time of publication. Re-
searchers and policy makers alike still need effective
tools to help them search, digest and organize their
knowledge of the primary literature.
One avenue that researchers have turned to is the
use of automated information extraction (IE). We
distinguish between two distinct uses of Information
Extraction: 1) extracting regular, formulaic fields
(e.g., author names, their institutional affiliation and
email addresses), and 2) extracting free text descrip-
tions of key study parameters (e.g., longitudinal vari-
ables, observation time periods, databases utilized).
Extracting such formulaic fields helps policy
makers determine returns on health-care investments
(Kwan et al, 2007), as well as researchers in large
scale sociological studies understand macroscopic
trends in clinical research authorship and topic shifts
over time (Cappell and Davis, 2008; Lin et al,
2008). But due to the wide variety of publication
venues for clinical research, even performing the
seemingly simple task of author name extraction
turns out to be difficult, and published studies thus
far have relied on manual analysis and extraction.
Proposals to extract values of key study parame-
ters may have more profound effects. Deeper char-
acterization of research artifacts will enable more
semantically-oriented searches of the clinical lit-
erature. Further programmatic access allows and
encourages data sharing of raw clinical trial re-
sults, databases and cohorts (Piwowar and Chap-
90
man, 2008) that may result in cost sharing across
on-going studies, saving funds for other deserving
clinical trials.
On one hand, the medical community has been
proactive in using natural language processing
(NLP) and information extraction technology in an-
alyzing their own literature. Many approaches to
metadata extraction have used regular expressions
or baseline supervised machine learning classifiers.
However, these techniques are not considered state-
of-the-art.
On the other hand, much of the work from the
NLP community applied to biomedical research has
been on in-depth relationship extraction, such as
the identification of gene pathways and protein-
protein interaction (PPI). While certainly difficult
and worthwhile problems to solve, there is room for
contribution even at the basic IE level, to retrieve
both regular and free form metadata fields.
We address this need in this paper. We apply a
linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Laf-
ferty et al, 2001) as our methodology for extracting
metadata fields. CRFs are a sequence labeling model
that has shown good performance over a large num-
ber of information extraction tasks. We conduct ex-
periments using basic token features to assess their
efficacy for metadata extraction. While preliminary,
our results indicate that CRFs are suitable for iden-
tifying formulaic metadata, but may need additional
deeper, natural language processing features to iden-
tify free text fields.
2 Related Work
Many researchers have recognized the utility of the
application of IE on biomedical text. These works
have focused mainly on the application of well-
known machine learning algorithms to tag impor-
tant biomedical entities such as genes and proteins
within biomedical articles. (Tanabe and Wilbur,
2002) uses a Na??ve Bayes classifier, while (Zhou et
al., 2004) uses use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
The Conditional Random Field (CRF) learning
model combines the strengths of two well known
methods: the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a se-
quence labeling methodology, and the Maximum
Entropy Model, a classification methodology. It
models the probability of a class label y for a given
token, directly from the observable stream of tokens
x in direct (discriminative) manner, rather than as
a by-product as in generative methods such as in
HMMs. A CRF can model arbitrary dependencies
between observation and class variables, but most
commonly, a simple linear chain sequence is used
(which connects adjacent class variables to each
other and to their corresponding observation vari-
able), making them topologically similar to HMMs.
Since their inception in 2001, (linear chain) CRFs
have been applied extensively to many areas, includ-
ing the biomedical field. CRFs have been used for
the processing and extraction of important medical
entities and their relationships among each other.
(He and Kayaalp, 2008) reports on the suitability of
CRFs to find biological entities, combining basic or-
thographic token features with features derived from
semantic lexicons such as UMLS, ABGene, Sem-
Rep and MetaMap. In a related vein, CRFs have
been applied to gene map and relationship identifi-
cation as well (Bundschus et al, 2008; Talreja et al,
2004).
In a different domain, digital library practition-
ers have also studied how to extract formulaic meta-
data to enable more comprehensive article index-
ing. To extract author and title information, systems
have used both the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
(Han et al, 2003) and CRFs (Peng and McCallum,
2004; Councill et al, 2008). These works have been
applied largely to the computer science community
and have not yet been extensively tested on biomed-
ical and clinical research articles.
Our work differs from the above by making use
of CRFs to extract fields in clinical text. Similar
lexical-based features are employed, however in ad-
dition to regular author metadata, we also attempt to
extract domain-specific fields from the body text of
the article.
3 Method
External to the scope of the research presented here,
our wider project goal focuses on constructing a
knowledge base of clinical researchers, databases,
instruments and expertise in the Asia-Pacific region.
Dataset. In this pilot study, we created a gold
standard dataset consisting of freely-available ar-
ticles available from PubMedCentral. These arti-
91
cles focused on health services research in the Asia-
Pacific region. In particular, we selected open-
access full-text literature documenting oncological
and cardio-vascular studies in the region, over a
three year period from 2005 to 2008.
By constructing an appropriate staged query with
PubMed, we obtained an initial listing of 260 arti-
cles. From an initial analysis, we determined that
a significant portion (?1/3) of the retrieved full-
text were not primary research, but reviews, case
studies, editorials or descriptions. After eliminating
these, the remaining 185 articles were earmarked to
be manually tagged by clinicians affiliated with the
project. Since the resulting corpus compiles arti-
cles across different journals and other publication
venues, their presentation of even the formulaic au-
thor metadata varied.
The clinicians were given rich text (RTF) versions
of the original HTML documents retrieved from
PubMed. They identified and extracted only the sec-
tions of the articles that had pertinent data classes to
tag. This process excluded most introductory, dis-
cussion and result sections, preserving the sections
that described the study and results at a high level
(e.g., Demographics and Methods).
After an initial training session, each clinician
used a word processor to manually insert opening
and closing XML tags for the tagset for a particular
subsection of the 185-article corpus. Due to the high
cost of clinician time, we chose to emphasize cover-
age, rather than have the clinicians multiply annotate
the same articles. As a result, we could not calculate
annotation agreement, but feel that the repeatability
of the annotation was addressed by the initial train-
ing. At the time of writing, 93 articles have been
completely tagged and sectioned, with the remainder
in progress. The average length of the documents is
about 1300 words. Once the dataset has been com-
pleted, we plan to release the annotated data offsets
to the public, to encourage comparative evaluation.
The clinicians annotated the following Formulaic
Author Metadata (3 classes):
? Author (Au): The names of the authors of the
study;
? E-mail (Em): The email addresses of the corre-
sponding authors of the study;
? Institution (In): The names of the institutions
that the authors are from.
Such metadata can be used to build an author ci-
tation network for macro trend analysis. Note that
this data is obtained from the article?s title page it-
self, and not from any references to source articles,
which have been the target of previous studies on
CRF-based information extraction (Peng and Mc-
Callum, 2004; Councill et al, 2008). The clinicians
also annotated the following Key Study Parameters
(10 classes):
? Age Group (Ag): The age range of the subjects
of the study (e.g., 45 and 80 years, 21-79
years);
? Data Analysis Name (Da): The name of the
method or software used in the analysis of data
collected for the study (e.g., proportional haz-
ards survival models, SAS package);
? Data Collection Method (Dc): The data collec-
tion methods for the study (e.g., medical
records, review of medical records and linkage
to computerized discharge abstracts);
? Database Name (Dn): The name of any biomed-
ical databases used or mentioned in the study
(e.g., Queensland Cancer Registry, National
Death Index, population-based registry);
? Data Type (Dt): The type of data involved in the
study (e.g., Cohort study, retrospectively);
? Geographical Area (Ga): The names of the ge-
ographical area in which an experiment takes
place or the subjects are from (e.g., Pune,
Switzerland);
? Intervention (Iv): The name of medical interven-
tion used in the study (e.g., surgery, radiother-
apy, chemotherapy, radio-frequency ablation);
? Longitudinal Variables (Lv): Data collected
over the observation period (e.g., subjects);
? Number of Observations (No): The number of
cases or subjects observed in the study (e.g.,
158 Indigenous, 84 patients);
92
? Time Period (Tp): The duration of an experi-
ment or observation in the study (e.g., 1997?
2002, between January 1988 and June 2006).
As can be seen from the examples, the tagging
guidelines loosely define the criteria for tagging. For
some classes, clinicians tagged entire noun phrases
or clauses, and for others, only numeric values and
modifiers were tagged. This variability arises from
the difficulty in tagging these free text fields.
Features. The CRF model requires a set of bi-
nary features to serve as a representation of the text.
A simple baseline is to use the presence/absence of
particular tokens as features. The CRF software im-
plementation we utilized is CRF++2, which com-
piles the binary features automatically from a con-
text window centered the current labeling problem
instance.
We first preprocess an input article from its RTF
representation and convert it into plain text. This
is a lossy transformation that discards font informa-
tion and corrupts mathematical symbols that could
be helpful in the detection task. We take hyphenated
token forms (e.g., 2006-2007) and convert them into
individual tokens. The plain text is processed to note
the specific locations of the XML tags for the learn-
ing process. The bulk of the words in each article
were not tagged by clinicians, and for these words,
we assigned a Not Applicable (NA) tag. We list
the simple inventory of feature types that we use for
classification.
? Vocabulary: Individual word tokens are stemmed
with Porter?s stemming algorithm (Porter,
1980) and down-cased to collapse orthographic
variants. Each word token is then used as an
individual feature. This feature alone was used
to compile baseline performance as discussed
later in evaluation.
? Lexical: Lists of keywords were compiled to lend
additional weight for specific classes. In par-
ticular, we compiled lists of months, common
names, cue words that signaled observations,
institution names and data analyses methods.
For example, a list of common given and sur-
name names is useful for the Au field; while a
2http://crfpp.sourceforge.net
list of months and their abbreviated forms help
to identify Tp. Each list constitutes a different
feature. As an example, in the case of human
names, the names Alice and Auburn are on the
list. If a word token corresponds to any of the
words in the list, the corresponding feature is
turned on (e.g., isApersonName).
? Position: If a word token is within the first 15
lines of an article, this feature is turned on. This
specifically caters to limit the scope of the for-
mulaic author metadata fields, to match them
only at the beginning of the article.
? Email: We create a specific feature for email ad-
dresses that is turned on when a particular word
token is matched by a handwritten regular ex-
pression.
? Numeric: For some free text classes, such as Ag,
No and Tp, the tagged text often contains nu-
meric data. This can be present in both numeric
and word form (e.g., 23 versus. twenty-three).
We turn this feature on for a token solely con-
taining digits or numeric word forms.
? Orthographic: Orthographic features, such as
the capitalization of a word token are useful to
help identify proper nouns and names. If there
are capital letters within a word token, this fea-
ture is turned on.
4 Evaluation
To ascertain the efficacy of our proposed solution,
three-fold cross validation (CV) was first performed
on a dataset comprising the 93 articles which have
been completely annotated.
Baseline. For the purpose of comparison, we cre-
ated a baseline system that utilizes the same CRF++
toolkit but uses only the vocabulary feature type
with a five-word window (two previous tokens, the
target token to be classified, and two subsequent to-
kens). The performance of this baseline system is
shown in Table 1, where the standard classification
performance measures of precision, recall and F1 are
given. Count measures the number of word tokens
that are predicted as belonging to the stated field.
Discussion. We see that the overwhelming major-
ity of tokens are not tagged (belonging to class NA).
93
The skewness of the dataset is not uncommon for IE
tasks.
The baseline results show weak performance
across the board. Clearly, significant feature engi-
neering could help boost performance. Of particular
surprise was the relatively weak performance on the
formulaic metadata. From our manual analysis, it
was clear that the wide range and variety of tokens
present in names and institutions barred the system
from achieving good performance on these classes.
Comparative studies in citation and reference pars-
ing usually peg classification performance of these
classes at the 95% and above level.
Without suitable customization, detection of the
key study parameters was also not possible. Only
relatively common fields could be captured by the
CRF, and when captured were more precise but
lacked enough data to build a model with any ac-
ceptable level of recall.
Table 2 illustrates the improved results obtained
by running CRF++ with all of the described features
on the same dataset. The same five-word window
size is used for the vocabulary feature. As seen, sig-
nificant improvements over the baseline are obtained
for all except four fields ? Da, Dc, Iv, and Lv.
These four fields were the classes with the most vari-
ability in annotation. For example, the data collec-
tion methodologies (Dc) and interventions (Iv) are
often captured as long sentence fragments and hard
to model with individual word cues.
The largest improvements occurred for the classes
of age groups Ag and time periods Tp, both of which
benefited from the addition of the numeric feature
which boosted recognition performance.
5 Future Work
The work presented here is ongoing, and based on
our current results, we are planning to re-examine
the quality of the annotations and refine our anno-
tation guideline and scheme. We discovered cases
where the CRF tagger correctly annotated key study
parameters which the annotators had missed or mis-
keyed. Drawing on lessons from the initial anno-
tation exercise, a more comprehensive guideline is
planned which will provide concise instructions with
accompanying annotation examples.
We also plan to enrich the feature set. The current

set employed is still simplistic and serves as a de-
velopmental platform for furthering our feature en-
gineering process. For example, the vocabulary, po-
sition and word lists features can be further modified
to capture more fined-grained information.
Once we exhaust the development of basic fea-
tures, our future work will attempt to harness deeper,
semantic features, making use of part-of-speech
tags, grammar parses, and named entity recognition
for example. The incorporation of these features will
likely be useful in improving the performance of the
CRF learner. We also plan to use both clinical re-
search and general medical ontologies (e.g., UMLS)
to gain additional insight on individual terms that
have special domain-specific meanings.
6 Conclusion
We have developed a CRF-based information ex-
traction system that targets two different types of
metadata present in clinical articles. Our work in
progress demonstrates that formulaic author meta-
data can be effectively extracted using the CRF
methodology. By further performing feature engi-
neering, we were able to extract key study parame-
ters with a moderate level of success. Our post eval-
uation analysis indicates that more careful attention
to annotation and feature engineering will be neces-
sary to garner acceptable performance of such im-
portant clinical study parameters.
