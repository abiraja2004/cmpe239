Abstract 
Ngram modeling is simple in language 
modeling and has been widely used in many 
applications. However, it can only capture the 
short distance context dependency within an 
N-word window where the largest practical N 
for natural language is three. In the meantime, 
much of context dependency in natural 
language occurs beyond a three-word window. 
In order to incorporate this kind of long 
distance context dependency, this paper 
proposes a new MI-Ngram modeling approach. 
The MI-Ngram model consists of two 
components: an ngram model and an MI 
model. The ngram model captures the short 
distance context dependency within an N-word 
window while the MI model captures the long 
distance context dependency between the word 
pairs beyond the N-word window by using the 
concept of mutual information. It is found that 
MI-Ngram modeling has much better 
performance than ngram modeling. Evaluation 
on the XINHUA new corpus of 29 million 
words shows that inclusion of the best 
1,600,000 word pairs decreases the perplexity 
of the MI-Trigram model by 20 percent 
compared with the trigram model. In the 
meanwhile, evaluation on Chinese word 
segmentation shows that about 35 percent of 
errors can be corrected by using the 
MI-Trigram model compared with the trigram 
model.  
1 Introduction 
Language modeling is the attempt to characterize, 
capture and exploit the regularities and constraints 
in natural language. Among various language 
modeling approaches, ngram modeling has been 
widely used in many applications, such as speech 
recognition, machine translation (Katz 1987; 
Jelinek 1989; Gale and Church 1990; Brown et al 
1992; Yang et al 1996; Bai et al1998; Zhou et al
1999; Rosenfeld 2000; Gao et al2002). Although 
ngram modeling is simple in nature and easy to use, 
it has obvious deficiencies. For instance, ngram 
modeling can only capture the short distance 
context dependency within an N-word window 
where currently the largest practical N for natural 
language is three.  
In the meantime, it is found that there always 
exist many preferred relationships between words. 
Two highly associated word pairs are ??/?? 
(?not only/but also?) and ? ? / ? ? 
(?doctor/nurse?). Psychological experiments in 
Meyer et al (1975) indicated that the human?s 
reaction to a highly associated word pair was 
stronger and faster than that to a poorly associated 
word pair. Such preference information is very 
useful for natural language processing (Church et 
al. 1990; Hiddle et al 1993; Rosenfeld 1994; Zhou 
et al1998; Zhou et al1999). Obviously, the 
preference relationships between words can expand 
from a short to long distance. While we can use 
traditional ngram modeling to capture the short 
distance context dependency, the long distance 
context dependency should also be exploited 
properly. 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a new 
MI-Ngram modeling approach to capture the 
context dependency over both a short distance and a 
long distance. Experimentation shows that this new 
MI-Ngram modeling approach can significantly 
decrease the perplexity of the new MI-Ngram 
model compared with traditional ngram model.  In 
the meantime, evaluation on Chinese word 
segmentation shows that this new approach can 
significantly reduce the error rate. 
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, 
we describe the traditional ngram modeling 
approach and discuss its main property. In section 3, 
we propose the new MI-Ngram modeling approach 
to capture context dependency over both a short 
distance and a long distance. In section 4, we 
measure the MI-Ngram modeling approach and 
evaluate its application in Chinese word 
segmentation. Finally we give a summary of this 
paper in section 5. 
And the probability P  can be estimated 
by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

Where )(?C  represents the number of times the 
sequence occurs in the training data. In practice, due 
to the data sparseness problem, some smoothing 
techniques, such as linear interpolation (Jelinek 
1989; Chen and Goodman 1999) and back-off 
modeling (Katz 1987), are applied.  
2 Ngram Modeling

that make up the hypothesis, the probability of the 
word string P  can be computed by using the 
chain rule:

probability of the next word w is independent of 
word string w  in the history. The difference 
between bigram, trigram and other ngram models is 
the value of N. The parameters of an ngram are thus 
the probabilities:

For a word string pair (  over a distance

information  reflects the degree of 
preference relationship between the two strings 
over a distance . Several properties of mutual

value of ,  the stronger affinity  and ),d,( BAMI A

to measure the preference relationship degree 
between a word string pair. 
From the view of mutual information, an ngram 
model assumes the mutual information 
independency between ( . Using an 
alternative view of equivalence, an ngram model is

pairs. Since the number of possible long distance 
dependent word pairs may be very huge, it is 
impossible for MI-Ngram modeling to incorporate 
all of them. Therefore, for MI-Ngram modeling to 
be practically useful, how to select a reasonable 
number of word pairs becomes very important. 
Here two approaches are used (Zhou et al1998 and 
1999). One is to restrict the window size of possible 
word pairs by computing and comparing the 
perplexities1 (Shannon C.E. 1951) of various long 
distance bigram models for different distances. It is 
found that the bigram perplexities for different 
distances outside the 10-word window become 
stable. Therefore, we only consider MI-Ngram 
modeling with a window size of 10 words. Another 
is to adapt average mutual information to select a 
reasonable number of long distance dependent word 
pairs. Given distance d and two words A and B, its 
average mutual information is computed as: 
Compared with mutual information, average 
mutual information takes joint probabilities into 
consideration. In this way, average mutual 
information prefers frequently occurred word pairs. 
In our paper, different numbers of long distance 
dependent word pairs will be considered in 
MI-Ngram modeling within a window size of 10 
words to evaluate the effect of different MI model 
size. 
4 Experimentation 
As trigram modeling is most widely used in current 
research, only MI-Trigram modeling is studied 
here. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the 
effect of different numbers of word pairs in 
MI-Trigram modeling, various MI-Trigram models 
with different numbers of word pairs and the same 
window size of 10 words are trained on the 
XINHUA news corpus of 29 million words while 
the lexicon contains about 56,000 words. Finally, 
various MI-Trigram models are tested on the same 
task of Chinese word segmentation using the 
Chinese tag bank PFR1.0 2  of 3.69M Chinese 
characters (1.12M Chinese Words).

because the entropy of a random variable corresponds to 
the average number of bits per event needed to encode a 
typical sequence of event samples from that random 
variable? s distribution.

Table 1 shows that 
? The perplexity and the F-measure rise quickly 
as the number of word pairs in MI-Trigram 
modeling increases from 0 to 1,600,000 and 
then rise slowly. Therefore, the best 1,600,000 
word pairs should at least be included. 
? Inclusion of the best 1,600,000 word pairs 
decreases the perplexity of MI-Trigram 
modeling by about 20 percent compared with 
the pure trigram model. 
? The performance of Chinese word 
segmentation using the MI-Trigram model with 
1,600,000 word pairs is 0.8 percent higher than 
using the pure trigram model (MI-Trigram with 
0 word pairs). That is to say, about 35 percent of 
errors can be corrected by incorporating only 
1,600,000 word pairs to the MI-Trigram model 
compared with the pure trigram model. 
? For Chinese word segmentation task, recalls are 
about 0.7 percent higher than precisions. The 
main reason may be the existence of unknown 
words. In our experimentation, unknown words 
are segmented into individual Chinese 
characters. This makes the number of 
segmented words in the answer file higher than 
that in the key file. 
It is clear that MI-Ngram modeling has much 
better performance than ngram modeling. One 
advantage of MI-Ngram modeling is that its number 
of parameters is just a little more than that of ngram 
modeling. Another advantage of MI-Ngram 
modeling is that the number of the word pairs can be 
reasonable in size without losing too much of its 
modeling power. Compared to ngram modeling, 
MI-Ngram modeling also captures the 
long-distance context dependency of word pairs 
using the concept of mutual information.

6  Conclusion 
This paper proposes a new MI-Ngram modeling 
approach to capture the context dependency over 
both a short distance and a long distance. This is 
done by incorporating long distance dependent 
word pairs into traditional ngram model by using 
the concept of mutual information. It is found that 
MI-Ngram modeling has much better performance 
than ngram modeling.  
Future works include the explorations of the 
new MI-Trigram modeling approach in other 
applications, such as Mandarin speech recognition 
and PINYIN to Chinese character conversion.
