Abstract
In relative clauses, the wh relative pro-
noun can be embedded in a larger phrase,
as in a boy [whose brother] Mary hit.
In such examples, we say that the larger
phrase has pied-piped along with the wh-
word. In this paper, using a similar syntac-
tic analysis for wh pied-piping as in Han
(2002) and further developed in Kallmeyer
and Scheffler (2004), I propose a composi-
tional semantics for relative clauses based
on Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar. It will be shown that (i) the elemen-
tary tree representing the logical form of
a wh-word provides a generalized quanti-
fier, and (ii) the semantic composition of
the pied-piped material and the wh-word is
achieved through adjoining in the seman-
tics of the former onto the latter.
1 Introduction
In relative clauses, the wh relative pronoun can be
embedded in a larger phrase, as in (1) and (2). In
such examples, we say that the larger phrase con-
taining the wh-word has PIED-PIPED along with
the wh-word.
(1) a boy [ [whose brother]i Mary hit ti ]
(2) a boy [[whose brother?s friend]i Mary hit ti]
In this paper, using a similar syntactic analysis for
wh pied-piping as in Han (2002) and further devel-
oped in Kallmeyer and Scheffler (2004), I propose
a compositional semantics for relative clauses of
the sort illustrated in (1) and (2), based on Syn-
chronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG). The
two main components of my proposal are that (i)
the semantic tree representing the logical form of a
wh relative pronoun provides a generalized quan-
tifier, and (ii) the semantic composition of the
pied-piped material and the wh-word is achieved
through adjoining of the former onto the latter in
the semantics. Although TAG semantics for rel-
ative clauses based on flat semantics have been
proposed before (Han, 2002; Kallmeyer, 2003), no
STAG-based analysis exists, as far as I know.
In section 2, I introduce the framework of
STAG and STAG-based compositional semantics
and clarify my assumptions. In section 3, I present
my analysis of relative clauses and pied-piping. I
extend the proposed analysis to relative clauses in
which wh-word is in a PP and those in which no
pied-piping has taken place in section 4.
2 STAG-based Compositional Semantics
Before presenting my analysis of relative clauses, I
first illustrate the framework of STAG-based com-
positional semantics and clarify my assumptions,
using a simple sentence that contains an existential
quantifier and an attributive adjective in (3).
(3) John saw a good movie.
I use STAG as defined in Shieber (1994). In an
STAG, each syntactic elementary tree is paired
with one or more semantic trees that represent its
logical form with links between matching nodes.
A synchronous derivation proceeds by mapping a
derivation tree from the syntax side to an isomor-
phic derivation tree in the semantics side, and is
synchronized by the links specified in the elemen-
tary tree pairs. In the tree pairs given in Figure 1,
the trees in the left side are syntactic elementary
trees and the ones in the right side are semantic
trees. In the semantic trees, F stands for formulas,
R for predicates and T for terms. I assume that
these nodes are typed and I represent predicates
as unreduced ?-expressions. The linked nodes are
shown with boxed numbers. For sake of simplic-
ity, in the elementary tree pairs, I only include
links that are relevant for the derivation of given
examples.
Figure 1 contains elementary trees required to
generate the syntactic structure and the logical

form of (3). All the syntactic elementary trees sat-
isfy Frank?s (2002) Condition on Elementary Tree
Minimality (CETM), which states that ?the syn-
tactic heads in an elementary tree and their projec-
tions must form an extended projection of a sin-
gle lexical head? (Frank 2002, p. 54). Particu-
larly, (?a movie) is a valid elementary tree, as a
noun can form an extended projection with a DP,
in line with the DP Hypothesis. The proper name
tree in (?John) is paired with a tree representing
a term in the semantics, and the attributive adjec-
tive tree in (?good) is paired with an auxiliary tree
in the semantics that represents a one-place predi-
cate to be adjoined to another one-place predicate.
As for the syntax-semantics pairing of elementary
trees for quantified DPs, I follow Shieber and Sch-
abes (1990), and use Tree Local Multi-Component
TAG (as defined in Weir (1988)) in the seman-
tics. Thus, the DP in (?a movie) is paired with a
multi-component set {(??a movie), (??a movie)}
in the semantics: (??a movie) provides an argu-
ment variable, and (??a movie) provides the ex-
istential quantifier with the restriction and scope.
The transitive tree in (?saw) is paired with a se-
mantic tree representing a formula that consists of
a two-place predicate and two term nodes. The
links, shown with boxed numbers, guarantee that
whatever substitutes into DPi, the corresponding
semantic tree will substitute into the term node
marked with 1 , and whatever substitutes into DP
is paired up with a multi-component set in the se-
mantics where one of the components will substi-
tute into the term node marked with 2 and the
other will adjoin onto the F node marked with
2 . The syntactic and semantic derivation trees
are given in Figure 2, and the derived trees are
given in Figure 3. I leave out the tree addresses
in the semantic derivation tree, as these are deter-
mined by the links between the syntactic and se-
mantic elementary trees.1

The semantic derived trees can be reduced by
applying ?-conversion, as the nodes dominate
typed ?-expressions and terms. When reducing se-
mantic derived trees, in addition to ?-conversion, I
propose to use Predicate Modification, as defined
in Heim and Kratzer (1998) in (4).

1In sentences with more than one quantified DPs, I as-
sume multiple adjoining (as defined in Schabes and Shieber
(1994)) of quantifier trees at the same F node, leaving the
order unspecified. This provides an underspecified represen-
tation and accounts for scope ambiguity.

3 An STAG analysis of pied-piping in
relative clauses
I propose the elementary tree pairs in Figure 4
for the syntactic derivation and semantic compo-
sition of the relative clause in (1). In the syntax
side, (?who) substitutes into DPj in (?hit), and the
pied-piping of the rest of the DP is achieved by ad-
joining (??s brother) onto (?who). The tree in (??s
brother) is a widely-accepted genitive structure ac-
cording to the DP hypothesis, where the genitive ?s
heads the DP tree. This satisfies CETM, as a DP
is an extended projection of a noun. Substituting
(?mary) into DPi in (?hit) completes the deriva-
tion of the relative clause.
The derivation tree for the relative clause is in
(?1) in Figure 5 and the derived tree is in (?1) in
Figure 6.

Figure 5: Derivation trees for whose brother Mary

Semantically, we must make sure that the vari-
able coming from the wh-word is also the one be-
ing predicated of the head noun (boy in (1)), and
yet the same variable does not serve as an argu-
ment of the predicate (hit in (1)) in the relative
clause. I argue that the introduction of a gener-
alized quantifier (GQ) node in the semantic tree in
(??who) and adjoining of (???s brother) onto the
GQ node guarantee this. I define the logical form
of a wh relative pronoun as an auxiliary tree given
in (??who). In (??who), ?x binds x in the gen-
eralized quantifier, ?P.P (x). Adjoining (??who)
onto the relative clause elementary tree in (??hit)
essentially has the effect of abstracting over the
variable coming from the wh-word in the relative
clause, turning it into a one-place predicate. This
therefore ensures that the relative clause and the
head noun are predicating over the same variable,
deriving the interpretation of the relative clause
as a modifier of the head noun. The meaning of
the pied-piped material ?s brother is added onto
the meaning of who by adjoining the auxiliary
tree defined in (???s brother) onto the GQ node
in (??who). In (???s brother), ?y ensures that the
variable coming from the DP* (who) is in some
relation with the variable coming from the head
of the pied-piped DP (whose brother), and ?Q, by
turning whose brother into a GQ, ensures that the
variable coming from the head of the pied-piped
DP is the argument of the predicate that the DP
combines with. The derivation tree and the de-
rived tree in the semantics side are given in (??1)
in Figure 5 and (??1) in Figure 6. After all the ?-
conversions have applied, (??1) can be reduced to
the expression in (6).

The expression in (6) is a one-place predicate
which can be paraphrased as a set of all x?s such
that there is a unique brother z? and x is in some
relation with z? and Mary hit z?. As the seman-
tics of relative clauses is defined to be a one-place
predicate, it is analogous to attributive adjectives.
This means that the semantic tree resulting from
the adjoining of (??1) onto the logical form of the
head noun boy can be reduced to the expression in
(7) through Predication Modification.
(7) ?x.boy(x) ? THEz?[brother(z?) ?
Rel(x, z?)] [hit(Mary?, z?)]
The derivation of a sentence containing (1), a
boy whose brother Mary hit, as the object, as in
(8), proceeds in a similar fashion as in (3), yielding
the semantic derived tree which is reducible to the
formula in (9).
(8) John saw a boy whose brother Mary hit.
(9) ?x[boy(x) ? THEz?[brother(z?) ?
Rel(x, z?)] [hit(Mary?, z?)]] [saw(John?, x)]
For the syntactic derivation and the composi-
tional semantics of the relative clause in (2), all we
need to do is add the tree pair in Figure 7 to the set
of elementary tree pairs in Figure 4. In the syntax
side, (??s friend) adjoins onto (??s brother) and
in the semantics side, (???s friend) adjoins onto
(???s brother), as shown in the derivation trees in
Figure 8. The derived trees are given in Figure 9.
The semantic derived tree (??2) can be reduced to
the expression in (10) through ?-conversions.

4 Extensions
The proposed syntax and the semantics of pied-
piping can straightforwardly be extended to cases
in which the wh-word is embedded in a PP, as in
(11).
(11) a boy [ [DP the brother of whom]i Mary hit
ti ]
For the derivation of (11), we need to change two
of the elementary tree pairs in Figure 4 slightly.
The elementary tree pairs <(?who), (??who)>
and <(??s brother), ???s brother)> need to be re-
placed with the pairs in Figure 10. Since the rel-
ative pronoun in (11) is whom, we use a DP tree
anchoring whom in (?whom). The corresponding
semantic tree (??whom) remains exactly the same
as before. (?the brother of) represents the pied-
piped material in DP. It is a well-formed elemen-
tary tree according to CETM as it has a single lexi-
cal head brother and DP is an extended projection
of this head, and PP is not subject to CETM be-
cause P is a functional head, not a lexical head.
Moreover, DP* is licensed as it is an argument
of the lexical head brother, as argued in Kroch
(1989). The semantics of the brother of whom is
equivalent to whose brother, and therefore, we pair
up (?the brother of) with the exact same semantic
tree as (???s brother).
The derivation trees for the relative clause in
(11) are given in Figure 11. They look exactly the
same as the ones for the relative clause in (1), ex-
cept for names of the elementary trees in a few
nodes. The derived trees are given in Figure 12.
While the syntactic derived tree (?11) is different
from (?1) in Figure 6 in the structure of DP con-
taining the pied-piped material, the semantic de-
rived tree (??11) looks exactly the same as (??1)
in Figure 6. This is as it should be given that the
meaning of (1) and the meaning of (11) are equiv-
alent.

The proposed analysis can also be extended to
relative clauses in which no pied-piping has taken
place. When the larger DP containing the relative
pronoun is indefinite or non-specific, the DP can
be stranded, as in (12). This gives us a configura-
tion where a wh-word has extracted out of a DP.
(12) a boy [whomi Mary hit [DP a brother of ti]]
Since we now have a DP with an indefinite
article, a tree pair in Figure 13 is needed, for
the derivation of (12). Using the semantic tree
(??a brother of), the semantic composition of the
relative clause in (12) can proceed as before: the
semantic tree (??a brother of) adjoins onto the se-
mantic tree (??whom) in Figure 10, which then
adjoins onto (??hit) in Figure 4. In the syntax,
however, we must make sure that (?a brother of)
does not adjoin onto the relative pronoun whom,
because if it did, we would end up with the string
a brother of whom. Instead, what we need is
for (?a brother of) to adjoin onto the DP domi-
nating the trace of the extracted object in (?hit).
This however is not a valid derivation in STAG,
as elementary trees in a single pair are composing
with two trees from two different pairs. A slight
modification in the syntactic elementary tree for
(?whom) in Figure 14 can fix this problem. I pro-
pose to do this by turning (?whom) into a multi-
component set {(?whom), (?whom)} as in Fig-
ure 14. An auxiliary tree like (?whom), which

does not dominate any other nodes, is a degenerate
tree, and has been used in Kroch (1989) and Frank
(2002) to handle extraction from a wh-island, as in
[Which car]i does Sally wonder how to fix ti?
In syntax, to derive the relative clause in (12),
(?whom) substitutes into DPj in (?hit) as be-
fore, and (?whom) adjoins onto the DP domi-
nating the trace of the extracted object in (?hit),
as shown in the derivation tree (?12) in Figure
15. And in semantics, (??whom) adjoins onto
(??hit) as before, as shown in (??12) in Figure
15. Subsequently, in syntax (?a brother of) ad-
joins onto (?whom) giving us the DP a brother of
tj , and in semantics (??a brother of) adjoins onto
(??whom). Thus, by using the multi-component
set {(?whom), (?whom)}, we now have a situ-
ation where two elementary trees in a single pair
are composing with two trees belonging to another
pair. The syntactic and the semantic derived trees
are given in Figure 16. After ?-conversions, (??12)
can be reduced to the expression in (13).2

5 Conclusion
I have shown that STAG-based compositional se-
mantics for relative clauses with pied-piping is
2Partial stranding as in a boy [a picture of whom]i Mary
made a copy of ti can be handled by composing a multi-
component set for whom containing a degenerate DP tree and
another multi-component set for a picture of containing a de-
generate DP tree. Further, the impossibility of the stranding
of subject DP, as in *a boy whomi [a brother of ti] hit Mary,
can be handled by placing an NA constraint on the subject
DP dominating a trace in the relative clause tree.

possible using examples in which the wh-word
is embedded in a genitive DP, and shown that
the proposed analysis can straightforwardly be ex-
tended to cases in which the wh-word is embed-
ded in a PP. The main ingredients of the proposed
analysis are: in syntax, the pied-piped material ad-
joins to the wh-word, and in semantics, the wh-
word provides a GQ to which the meaning of the
pied-piped material adjoins. I have also shown
that similar analysis can handle cases in which the
wh-word alone has moved to [Spec,CP], strand-
ing the rest of the DP in situ, if we use a multi-
component set containing a degenerate DP for the
syntax of the relative pronoun. The proposed anal-
ysis utilizes composition operations in semantics
that are already available in syntax, substitution
and adjoining, thereby making syntax-semantics
mapping in TAG simple and straightforward.
