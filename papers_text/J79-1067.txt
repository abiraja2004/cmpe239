A Modcl of Dialogue 
SUMMARY 
Within a view of ianguagc users as problem solvers, speakers arc seen as creating 
uttcrsnccs in pursuit of thcir own goals. Dialogue "works" because this activity tends to 
scrvc goals of both participants. ,k Hcncc, fo r  the model of dialogue cornprchcnsion 
prcscnted here, rccognif ion of these goals of the speaker i s  central to the comprehension 
4 "  
of d i a l o ~ u c ,  
Wc have found that dialogues arc conrposud of structured interactions rcpresanted 
by collections of knowledge which dcscri be the intcrre latcd goals of the part ic ipants. 
We call thcsc knawlcd~c  structures "Dialogue-games" (DGg). This paper describes DGs 
in gcncra l ,  a particular one (the Hclping-DG) in some detail, how OGs are used by our 
D i a l o g ~ c - g a m e  Model (DGM), and the benefits of this model. 
A DG consists of three parts: the Parameters (the two roles fillcd by t hc  
part ic ipants, and the topic), the Pnramcter Spccifications (a  set of predicates on the 
Pararndcrs), and the  Components (a sequcncc of goals hgld by the participants i n  the 
course of the dialogue). 
For cxample, in  the Helping-DG, the Parameters are HELPER, HELPEE ( the rolcs) 
and TASK (the topic). The  Spccifications are: 1) The HELPEE wants to pertorm the  
TASK: 2) thc HELPEE wants t o  bc a6/e to do i t  but 3) the HELPEE i s  not able to. 4) The 
ILELPER wants to  enable the HELPEE to  do  the TASK and 5) the HELPER i s  ab/e to  
provide th is  help. The Componcntr specify that 1) the  HELPEE wants to  es tab l i sh  a 
context by describing a collection of unexceptional events (a parlial performance of the 
TASK): 2) he also wants to dcscribc some sort  of unresirable surprise: then 3) the. 
I-IELPER wants to  cxplain the violation of expectation so that the HELPEE can avoid i t  a'nd 
get on with the  TASK. 
The DGM makes use of DGs in fiue stages of processing: Nomination, Recognition, 
Instant iat ion, Conduct and Termination. 
Thc DGM models each  participant's knowlcd,ge, goal and attention states. A 
mcchanisrn adds to  the attention state, cmcepts "suggested" by those already in attention. 
Whcn a hearer sees himself or his partner as  potentially filling a role in a DG(by fulfilling 
one o r  more demands of the DG's Specifications) then that DG i s  brought into attention 
(Nominated), 
DGs can bc nominated by weak evidence: Recognition i s  the step of verifying that 
these DGs arc plausibly consistent with the currcnt state of the model. Thosa which arc 
not are eliminated f rom attention. 
A Model of Dialogue 
DGs which survive Lhc Recognition stagp arc Instantiated by asserting (as 
assumptions) all the Specifications not ye1 rcprcscnicd as holding. For example, when a 
person says "Do you have a match?", instantiation, by the hcarer (of the-~c t ion-sck  DG) 
dcrivcs asscrtionr; that thc speaker does not have a match and wants the hcarer to  give 
him one, 
The Conduct of ihc DG i s  rnodclcd by tracking the pursuit and fulfillment of the 
participants' goals as rcprescntcd in the Components. 
Whcn tho DGM dctcpls that onc parlicipant no longer regards a Specification as 
holding, this crcatcs an cxpcctation of the Termination of this phase of the 
dialogue--there i s  no longer a possibility that it will serve both participants' goals,  
Thc appendix contains a detailed hand-simulation of the DGM assimilating a 
scgrncnt of a dialogue.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
Thc broadest goal of our research has been to improve the sorry state of interactive 
man-machine communication, including its appearance of complexity, rigidity, lack of 
continuity and the  difficulty i t  poses for many people to acquire useful levels of 
cornpctcnce. I n  our pursuit of this goal, w e  have adopted-the following two assumptions: 
Assumption L: When pcople communicate w i th  machines, they do so b y  
using their already well-dcvelopcd ability to communicate w i th  other people. 
Assumption 2: The effectiveness of this communication i s  diminished b y  any 
adaptation required of the human. 
A scientific understanding of how people cvmmunicate i s  thus relevant to the design 
of man-machine communication schemes, but suchknowledge i s  seldom used in  the design 
process. Since human communication skills have not been characterized at a level of 
clctsil appropriate for guiding design, interface designers have not been able to take into 
account some major determinants of their succcss. 
The opcrativc goal of our research was therefore to creatd a mode/ of human 
communicafion at an appropriate level of detail to benefit man-machine communication 
design. Any form of communication must be based on ,knowledge shared b y  the  
individuals engazed in  that communication. However, the nature of this shared 
knowladgs and how i s  i t  uscd in the communicative process have not been we l l  
undcrstood. We have developed a working hypothesis which has deeply affected the  
r-csearch: 
Hypothesis: People know that certain kinds of goals may be pursued by 
communication, and they know which kinds of communication acts correspond 
to which goals. Tho use of this knowledge is essential to comprehending 
dialogue. 
I n  particular, a pcrson generates an utterance to advance one or more of his own goals. 
Thus, to assimilate a particular utterance, i t  i s  necessary to identify why  the person said 
i't. 
Working w i t h  this hypothesis, we have conducted three related investigations: 
A Model of Dialogue. 
1. A study of naturally occurring language to discover regularities of usage 
and to  determine what these regularities mean l o  the users of the language. 
2. The representation of there regularities as knowledge structures and 
processes in  a dialogue model. 
3. T h e  establishment of standards by which the model's performance can 
be compared with that of humans on closely related tasks. 
We have adopted two additional, tactical constraints on the  task: 
1. We have modeled only the receptive aspects of communication. 
2. Wc-have examined only dialquc communication, interaction i n  real-time, 
by exactly two people. These dialogues were conducted over a rcs t t ic tcd 
medium so i h a t  there was no visual or intonational communication not captured 
in thc  t r ~ n s c r i p t .  
A ~ o d c l  of Dialogue 
PAST RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION 
Most of the research jnto language comprehension has focused on the 
comprchcnsion of single sentences or fragments of sentences. However some research 
has indicated the importance of the context created by surrounding sentences on the 
comprchcnsion of an individual sentence. One specific model for the form of th i s  
multi-scntcntial knowledge i s  the "story schema", organized within a story grammar 
(Rurnclhart, 1975). This model has been supportbd' by the results 6f story recalls 
(Rumcl hart, 1975: Thorndyke, 1977). Other similar kinds of theoretical constructs for 
organizing multiple srntcnces of stories have been proposed called: "frames" (Minsky, 
1975: Charniak, 1975), "scripts" (Schank Q Abelson, 1975), and "commonsense 
algorithms" (Ricgcr, 1975). 
To account for the conduct and comprchcnsion of dialogues, mu1 ti-scntcntial 
knowlcdgc units have also bccn proposed by linguists and sociolinguists to explain 
certain kinds of rcgul ari tics observed in naturally occurring dialogues. These 
rcgularitics have bccn called "rules" by Labov & Fanshel (19.74) and "sequences" by 
Sacks, Schagloff, & Jefferson (1974). 
Once these multi-scntential knowledge units a re  evoked, they serve as a basis for  
comprehending the~successive inputs. This is achieved by generating expectations and 
by providing a framework for integrating the comprehcnsion of an utterance w i t h  that of 
i t s  prcdcccssors. Recently, we have propased (Leuin & Moore, 1976: 1977, Mann, 
Moorc  Rr Lcvin, 1977) multi-scntential knowledge units that are specified primari ly by 
the speaker's and hcarcr's goals. Thcsc goal-oriented units, which w e  call 
Dialogue-gsmcs[l], specify the kinds of language interactions in wh ich people engage, 
ra thcr  than the spccific content of thcsc intcractions. Pcoplc use langua~c  primari ly t o  
comrnunicatc with other pcoplc l o  achieve their own goals. Thc Dialoguc-game 
mu1 ti-scntontial structures wcrc dcvcloped to represent this knowledge about language 
and how i t  can be uscd to achicve goals. 
-[I] Thc term "Oialoguc-game" was adopted by analogy from Wittgcnstcin's term 
'Yan~uagc game" ( ~ i t t ~ c n s t c i n ,  1 9  8). a Howcvcr, Dialogue-games reprcs6ht knowlcdgo ?= pcoplc h i v e  dbout language as uscd to purGuo goals, rathcr than Wittgcnrtcin's m o p  
~ c n c r a l .  notion. Althoueh other "game-." arc similar, thc propcrtios of .Dia)ofiuo-,gornes 
a r c  only thooo dcscribod here. For example, thoy aro not nacoroarify cornpctitivc, 
consciouily pursued, or zcro-sum. 
A Model of Dialogue 
An important problem for rcscarchcrs of language comprehension i s  posed by 
scntences w i t h  wh ich  tho speaker performs what philosophers of language have ca l led  
"indirect spccch acts" (Searle, 1969). The direct comprehension of these sentences 
fai ls to der ive  the main communicative~effcct. For example, declarative scntenccs can be 
used to seek information ("1 nced to know your Social Security number."): questions can be 
u-scd to convey information ("Did you know that John and Harriet got married?") or t o  
request an action ("Could you pass the salt?''). These kinds of utterances, w h i c h  have 
b c c n  extensively analyzed b y  philosophers of language (Austin, 1962: Searle, 196 9, 
1975: Grice, 1975), are not handled satisfactorily by  any of the current theories of t h e  
d i r cc t  comprchcnsion of language. However, these indirect language usages ara 
widespread in  naturally occurring language--even two-year-old ch i ldren can 
comprehend indirect requests for action almost as well as dircct requests (Shatz, 1975). 
O n e  theory proposcd to account for these indirect uses of language i s  based on the 
concept of "convcrsotional postulates" (Grice, 1975: Gordon Q Lakoff, 197 1). I f  the  
d i rcc t  comprchcnsion of an utterance is  implausible, then the indirect meaning i s  de r i ved  
using these postulates. Clark & Lucy (1 975) formalized and tested th is  model, and found 
that people's rasponse times tend to support a three-stage model (deriving the l i te ra l  
mcaning, check i ts  plausibil i ty and, i f  implausible, dcriving the "intended" meaning" from 
convcrsational rules). 
I n  general, this approach to i n d i r e d  speech acts i s  infc~ence-bascd, depending on 
the  application of conversational rules to infer the indirect meaning from the  d i rcc t  
mcaning and the context. A different approach has been proposcd b y  L s b o v ~ f i F a n s ~ c l  
(1 974) and by Levin & Moore (1976: 1977). Multi-sentential knowledge, organizing a 
scgmcnt of language interaction, can form the basis for deriving the indikect effect of 
u t t c r~ncc  wi th in  the segment. For example, a multi-sentential structure for  an 
information-seeking interaction can sypply the appropriate context for interpreting the 
subscqucnt utterances to s ~ c k  and t-hen supply information. The infcrcncc-bascd 
approach rcqui rcs one set of convcrs~t ional  rulc-, for information requests, a dif fcrcnt  9ct 
of ru lcs  for  answers to these rcquc:ts, and a way t o  tic thcnc two  rulc sets together. The 
Dialogue-game model postulates a single k n o w l c d ~ e  struclurc for this kind of interaction, 
w i t h  coopcrating proccssc; for: (1) rccognizinp; when this kind of interaction i s  proposcd, 
(2) using this knowlcdgc to comprchcnd uttcranccn within i ts scope, and (3) ident i fy ing 
when  the interaction i s  to be terminated, 
A Modc l  of Dialogue 
THE SHAPE OF THE THEORY 
Our thcory  of human language use has bccn strongly influenced by w o r k  in human 
prob lem solving (Ncwcll XI Simon, 1972) in which the bchavior of a human i s  modeled as 
an information. processing system, having goals to pursue and selecting actions w h i c h  
tend to  schicvc thcsc goals. Wc view humans as engaging in linguistic bchavior in order 
to  advance the state of certain of thcir eoals. Thcy dccide to use language, they sclcct 
(o r  accept) thc  other participant for a dialogue, they choose the details of l inguistic 
cxp rcss ion  -- all with the expectation that some of their desired state specifications can 
thcrcby be rcalizcd, 
In this thcory of lancuagc, a participant in  a linguistic exchange views the other as 
an indcpcndcnt information-processing system, w i th  separate knowledge, goals, abi l i t ies 
and acccss l o  the world. A spcsker h a s  a range of potcntial changes he can cf fcct  i n  h i s  
l i ~ t c n c r ,  a corresponding collection of linguistic actions which may result in each such 
chance, and some notion of the conscqucnccs of performing each of these. The  spcokcr 
may view the hcarcr  as a resource for information, a potential actor, or as an object  to bc 
moldcd into sorrrc dcsircd state. 
A dialogue involves two  speakers, who altcrnatc as hearers. I n  choosing to  in i t iate 
or  conl inuc tho cxchany,~, a participant attcmpts to satisfy his own goals: in in tcrprct ing 
on ut tcrancc of h is  partner, each participant attcmpts to find the way in w h i c h  that 
utterance serves the goals of his partner. Thus a dialoguo continues because the 
part icipants continue to scc i t  as furthering thcir  own goals. Likewise, when the dialoguc 
no l o n ~ o r  serves the goals of one of the participants, i t  i s  redirected to new goals o r  
tcrminatcd.

A Model of Dialogue 
THE DIALOGUE-GAME MODEL 
This section describes our Dialogue-game Model at i t s  current state of 
dcvclopmcnt. I t  starts w i t h  a brdef overview of dialogue and how i t  i s  structured, then  
descr ibes the dominant knowledge structures w h i c h  guide the model, and f ina l ly  
dcscribcs a set of processes which apply these knowledge structures t o  text to  
comprehend i t  
Within the mb.dcl., each participant in a dialogue i s  simply pursuing his own goals of 
t h c  moment. The two  participants interact smoothly because the conventions of 
communication coordinate their  goals and give them continuihg reasons t o  speak and 
listen. These goals have a number of attributes which are not necessarily consequences 
of c i t hc r  human activity in general, or communication in particula'r; but which are 
nonetheless characteristic of human communication in  the form of dialogue: 
1. Goals are cooperatively esta5lished. Bidding and acceptance 
activi t ies serve to  intfoduce goals. 
2. Goa/s.aremufua//yknown. Eachpar t yassumesorcomes tp  
know goals of the othcr, and each interprets the entire dialogue relat ive to 
current ly known goals. 
3. Goalsareconf ieu~edbyconvenf ion.  Setsofgoalsforusein 
dialogue (and othcr lwguage use as well) are tac i t ly 'known and employed by 
all competent spe;l&rs of the  language. 
4. Goa/s are bilateral. Each dialogue participant assumes goals 
complementary to those of his partner. 
5. Gas/ssreubiguilous. A h o a r e r v i e w s t h c s p e ~ k e r a s a l w a y s  
having goals hc i s  pursuing by speaking. Furthermore, the hearer recognizes 
and uses thcsc goals as part of h is  understanding of the utterance. 
An ~ninlerrupted ialogue goes through three phases: 
establishing goals, 
pcir sui ng eobl s, 
dccommitting from goals. 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
Typically this sequcncc i s  repeated several times over the coursc of a few rninutcs. 
We havc crcotcd knowlcdse structurcs to rcprescnt these convcntions,, and 
proccsscs to apply the conventions to actual dialo~ucs to comprehend them; Since the 
knowledsc structures dominatc al l  of the activity, they are described f irst.  The 
assimilation of an uttcranco in the dialogue i s  rcprcscntcd in this model by a sequence of 
modifica\ions of a "Work~pacc"[2] which rcprcscnfs the attention or awareness af the 
listening party. Tho modificN~tions arc roughly cyclic: 
1. A ncw item of text f i s  brought into attention through the 
"Par scr."[-21 
2. Interpretive conscqucnces~of T are developed in the Workspace by 
a variety of proccsscs. 
3. An exprcssian E appears in thc Wor'kspace w h i c h  specifics the 
relation between i and the imputed goals of the spcaker of T. 
This final cxprcssion i s  of coursc a formal expression in the knowledge 
representation of the modcl. E rcprcsents the proposition (held by the hcarer) that in 
uttering T, the spcaker was performing an act in pursuit of G, a-spbaker's goal known to 
thc hcarer. Sucrcssful comprchcnsion i s  cquatcd with relating tcxt to sal isf  action of 
spcakcr's goals. 
To makc an explicit account of dialoguc in this way, wc now describc the knowledge 
structures that rcprcscnt those c~~nvcgtions which supply tho goals for the participants to 
pursue. I n  particular, wc will anewcr thc following thrco questions: 
1. What i s  thc knowlcd~o wo arc rcprescnting within tho dofinition of o 
pclrlicular Dialogue-gamc7 
2, How i s  this knowledge? used to modcl tho roccptive acts of dialogue

k Model of Dialogue 
3. What*sort  of processes docs i t  take to support this model? 
A Dialogue-game consists of thrcc? parts: a set af Parameters, a collection of 
Spco/~c ,~ l l ' ons  that apply to these Paramctcrs throughout the conduct of the game, 
and a par t ia l ly  o rdcrcd  set of Components characterizing the dynamic aspects of t he  
came. For  the bslancc of this section, we will elaborate on these three par ts  and 
cxcmp l i f y  these with an cxalliple of the Helping-game. 
D ia lo~ue-games capture a certain collection of inforhation, common across many 
dialv~ucs.  However, the individual participants involved and the content subject  df t he  
dialoguc may yary  freely over dialogues described b y  the same Dialogue-game. To 
represent  this, each Dialogue-game has a set of Parameters wh ich  assume specif ic values 
f o r  each part icular  dialogue. 
Thc dialogue types w c  have represented so far as Dialogue-games have each 
requ i red  only thrcc Parameters: the two participants involved (called "Roles"), and the 
subjcct  of the dialogue (called "Topic"). 
Pa ra rndc r  Spccifications 
Onc of the  major aspects distinguishing various types of d'ialogucs i s  the set of goals 
hcld by the  participants. Another such aspect i s  the set of kno'wledgc states of the  
participants. We have found that each type of dialogue has a char$cteristic set of eaal 
and knowledge states of the participants, vis-a-vis each other and the subject. W i t h i n  
the formalism of the Dialogue-game, these are called the Parameter Spccifications, and 
a re  rcprpscnted b y  a collection of predicates on the Parameters. 
These Spccifications are known to the participants of the  dialogue, and the 
requirement that they be satisfied during the conduct of a game i s  used by thp part ic ipants 
t o  signal what Dialogue-games they wish to conduct, to  recognize what game i s  be ing  bid, 
t o  dccide how t o  respond to a bid, to conduct the game once the  bid i s  accepted, and t o  
terminate the  garno when appropriate. These Spccifications also provide the means with 
w h i c h  t o  expla in  the implicit, but clearly succcssful, communication which accompanics 
any natural d i a l o g ~ c .  Examples and discussions of these Specifications will accompany 
the fo l low ing  descr ipt ion of !he Helping-game. 
Componcnts 
W h i l e  the Paramctsr Spccificstions represent those aspects of a dialogue t y p e  that  
r cma in  constant throughout the course of a dialogue of that type, we have also found tha t  
certain aspects change i n  systematic ways. Thcse are reprcsented i n  Dialogue-games a5 
Components. I n  the Dialogue-games we have developed so far, the Components a re  
r c p r c s c n t c d  9s a set of participants' subgoals, part ial ly ordered i n  time. 
Bidding and Accepting 
Eiddinp, and Acccptancc arc entry operations which people use to  c n t c r  
Dia lo~uc-games.  Bidding 
1. identi f ies thc game, 
2. indicates the bidder s interest i n  pursuing t'hc game, 
3. idcn tifies the Psramctcr configuration intcnded. 
Bidding i s  performed many dif fcrcnt ways, often very br ic f ly .  I t  i s  typical ly  the  
source of a great deal of impl ic i t  comrnunicotion, since a br ic f  bid can cornmunicatc all of 
the Pararncters and thc i r  Specifications f o r j h e  Dialogue-game being bid. 
Acceptance i s  one of tho typical responses to a Bid, and leads to p u r w i t  of t h c  game.

Once a eamc has bccn bid and acccptcd, the two participants each pursue t h e  
subgoals spccificd for their role by the Components of this game. Thcse subgoals are  
mutual ly  complcn~cntary, each set facilitating the other. Furthermore, by the time the  
tcrrninati on stage has been rcachcd, pursuit of t he  Component-specified subgoals will 
have assurcd satisfaction of the higher, initial goals of the participants, for which the 
Came was initiated in thc first place. 
I n  this scction, wc c.xhibit a specific Diolocuc-game: the Helping - gn/ne. This 
game i s  prcscntcd in an informal rcprcsentation, in  order to  emphasize the informational 
content, rather than the representational power of our formalism. Later in  this report we 
will prcscnt thc formal analocue of this same game. I n  what follows, the bo ld  face 
indicates the  information contained in tho representation of this particular Dialogue-game:

Pnmn~clcrs:  HELPEE, HELPER, and TASK. 
The HELPEE wants help from the HELPEE. The TASK is  
some sort of a problem, otherwise unspecified. 
Paran~eler Specificat ions: 
HELPEE: wants to perform TASK. 
HELPFE: wants lo be able lo perform TASK. 
HELPEE: not ab/e lo perform TASK. 
HELPEE: permit ted t i i  per f i rm  TASK. 
MELPFF: a person. 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
Thcse Spccifications not only constrain who would qualify 
as fi l l ing the rolc of HELPEE, but also provide reliable information 
about t he  HELPEE, given that this individual i s  believed to be 
engaged i n  the Helping-game. This prohibits someone from 
asking for help on a problem he did not want solved. Similarly, i f  
one r c c ~ i v c s  what he judges to  be a sincere request for help to do 
some task, the helper normally as:umes that the requester has the 
necessary authority to do the task, i f  only he knew how. 
HELPER: wants t o  help HELPEE perform TASK. 
HELPER: able to provide help. 
HELPER: a person. 
So, in ordcr to be a HELPER, an individual must be wil l ing and 
able to  provide the needed assistance. Since th is Dialogue-game 
rcprcscnts shared knowledge, the HELPER knows t h e s e  
Spccifications, and therefore will not b id the Helping-game to 
someone who i s  not likely to meet them. And similarly, no one 
who fails to meet these Specifications (and knows he fails) w i l l  
accept a bid for the Helping-game with himself as HELPER. 
Components of the Helping - game: 
Thcre are three components: the first two constitute the 
"Diagnosis" phase to communicate what the problem is. 
. HELPEE wants HEfPFR to know about a sef of unexcepfiona/, acfuuii/ 
events. 
'The HELPEE sets up a context by describing a situation 
where everything, so far, i s  going well. Since the HELPEE 
assumes that the TASK i s  understood by the HELPER, he also 
assumes that the HELPER shares his expectations for r~bsequent 
activity. 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
2. HELPEEwc.mts HELPERfoknowabouf: 
// a set of exceptional events whkh occurred 
or 
2) a set of expected, unexcepflbnal events which did not occur. 
This pattern of a Helping-game i s  sufficiently well known to 
the participants, that the HELPEE almost never needs to  actually 
ask a question at this point. By simply exhibiting a failure of 
expectation, the HELPEE has communicated that this acts as a 
block to  his successfully pursuing the TASK. The HELPER i s  
expected to explain why  the failure occurred and how HELPEE can- 
avoid it or otherwise continue in the TASK. 
The third componcnt specifies the 'Treatment" phase where 
the HELPER communicates an explanation for the perceived 
failure. 
3 HELPER wants HELPEE fo know about an action which w i l l  avoid the 
undesired event or cause the desired one. 
The context description enables the HELPEE to identify a 
collection of activities which he understands, and in which the 
HELPEE i s  attempting to participate. The 
violation-of-expectation description points out just where the 
HELPEE's image of the activities differs from the correct image. I t  
i s  from this area of difference that the HELPER selects an action 
for the HELPEE. 
A Model of Dialogue 
#ia/o,mue - games i n  the Con?pre/rension of Dialogue 
I n  this section we describe the five stages of dialogue assimilation and detail the 
involvement of Dialogue-games wi th ~ a c h  stage: 
1) nomination, 
2) recognition, 
3) instantiation, 
4) conduct, 
5) termination. 
Proccssi ng Environment 
Our description of the model should be viewed as representing the changing 
coy,nitive state of one of the participants, throunhout the course of the dialogue. That is, 
two models are involved, one for each participant. Since the same processing 
occurs for both, we wi l l  describe only one. 
T h c  Dialogue-Game Modcl consists of a Long-Term Memory (LTM), a Workspacc 
(WS), and a set of proccsscs that modify the contents of WS, contingent upon the contents 
of LTM and  WS. LTM conbins a rcprescntation of the knowledge that the partigular 
di ologuc participant bl ines to the dialogue b c f o ~ e  i t  starts. This includcs knowlcdgc 
about the  world, relevant objects, processes, concepts, the cognitive statc of h i s  partner 
in dialogue, rules of inference and evidence, as well as linguistic knowlcdp;e (words and 
thc i r  semantic rcprcscntation, case frames for verbs and predicates and the multi-turn 
language s'trbctures, the  Dialogue-games). 
WS i s  the volatile short-term rncmory of thc modcl, containing all the partial and 
temporary rcsults of processing. The contcnte of WS at any momcnt rcprc.;cnt thc 
madel's state of comprchcnsion and focus at that point. Tho processes arc autonomous 
specialists, opcrl~tiny: indcpcndcntly and in parallel, to modify thqentitics in WS (callcd 
"activations"). Thcsc proccsscs a rc  also influcnccd by the contents of WS, as wel l  a.; b y  
thc  knowlcdgc in LTM. Thus, WS i s  the place in which thcso concurrcnt~ly operating 
proccsscs interact with each othcr. This anarchistic control structure rcscrnblcs that 
the HEARSAY system (Erman, Fennel, Lesser & Rcddy, 1973) 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
Nomination 
When d ia lo~uc participants propose a new type of interaction, they do not 
consistently use any single word or  phrase to introducc the interaction. Thus we cannot 
dcterminc which Dialogue-games represent the dialoguc type through a simple 
invocation by namc or any othcr pre-known collection of words or phrases. Instcad the 
d i o l o ~ u c  type i s  cornmunicatcd by attempts to establish various entities as the  values of 
the Psi actcrs of ihe dcsircd Dialogue-game. Thus, an utterance w h i c h  i s  
cornprchcndcd as associating an entity (a-person or a concept) with a Parameter of a 
Di aloguc-game suggests that Dialogue-game as a possi bilily for initiation. 
The Dialogue-Game Modcl has two ways in which these nominations of n c w  
Dialo~uc-games occur. One of the processes of the modcl i s  a "spreading activation" 
proccss  call& Protcus (Lcvin, 1976). Protcus gcncratcs new activations i n  WS on thc 
basic of cclations in LTM, from concepts (nodes i n  the semantic network) that are already 
i n  WS. Protcus brings into focus concepts somehow related to  those already thcrc. A 
collection of concepts in WS leads to focusing on some aspect of a part icular 
Dialocuc-game, in this sense "nominating" i t  as a possible new Dialoeue-game. 
MATCH and DEDUCE are two of thc modcl s processes which operatc in  .conjunction 
to ccncratc ncw activations from existing ones, means of finding and ap,prp@rulc-like 
transformations, Thcy operate through partial match and plausible i nfcrencetcchniques, 
and i f  thcy activate Pardrnetcrs, thcn the Dialogue-gsrnc that contains those ~ a r a r n d t c r s  
bccomcs nomina,tcd as .a  candidate Dialogue-game. Match and Deduce operate to,gether 
as a kind of production system (Newell, 1973). 
For  cx;lmplc, from the input utterance: 
"I tr ied to send a message to <person> at <computer-site3 and it~didn't go." 
the following t w o  scqucnccs of associations and inferences result: 
( l a )  I tr jcd toX. 
(25) 1 wpntcd to X. 
(3a) 1'want to X. 
(4a) HELPEE wants to do TASK. 
( I b) It didn't go. 
(2b) What I tr ied to do didn't work. 
(3b) X didn't work. 
(4b) I can't X. 
(58) 1 don't know ha to X. 
(6b) HEL.PEE\doc$n7t know how to do TASK. 
A Model of Dialogue 
(Where: I = HELPEE and X = do TASK = send a message to <person> at <computer-site>.) 
A t  th i s  point, (45) and (6b), since they are both Parameter Specifications for the 
Helping-game, cause the model to focus on this Dialogue-game, in effect nominating i t  as 
an organizing structure for the dialogue being initiated. 
Thc proccsscs described so far are reasonably unselective and may activate a 
number of possible Dialogue-eamcs, some of which may be mutually incompatible or 
othcrwisc inappropriate. The Dialogue-garnc Manager investigates each of the 
nomi natcd Dial.oguc-games, verifying infcrcnccs based on the Parameter Specifications, 
and eliminating< those Dialogue-gamcs for which one or more Specifications are 
contraclictcd. 
A second rncchanism (part of Protcus) identifies those activations which are 
incornpati blc and scts about accumulating evidence in support of a decision to accept one 
and dclctc the rest from the WS. 
Fdr cxarnplc, suppose the question 
"How do I get RUNOFF to work?" 
lcads to the nomination of two games: 
Info-scck-game (pcrson asking question wants to know answer) 
and 
Info-probe-game (pcrson asking q u c d i ~ n  wants to k n ~ w  if other knows answcr) 
Thcso Iwo Dialocuc-~nrncs have a l o t  in common hut differ in  ono crucial aspect,: I n  the 
Info-scck-gamc, t hc  qucctioncr docs not know the answcr to thc question, whilc in  thc 
Info-probc-game hc doc:. Thcsc two prcdicatcs arc rcprcscntcd in the Parameter 
Spc.cifications of t hc two Di al.ogue-games, and upon thcir joint nomination are discovarcd 
to bc contradictory. Prolcus rcprcsent: this d i~covery  wi th a structure which ha5 the 
c f f cc t  of climinatinp, thc conflicting Dialogue-came with the least supporting evidence. 
Such support might be, for cxamplc, cither the knowledge that the speaker i s  t h ~  hearcr's 
tcachcr or that hc i s  a novice prograrnrncr (which would icnd support f6r tho choicc of the  
Info-prabc-errme or Info-seek-garnc, respectively). 
A Model of, Dialogue 21 
Through these proccsscs, the number of candidate Dialogue-games i s  reduced until 
those remaining are rompatible w i t h  each other and with the knowledge current ly in WS 
and in LTM. 
Instant iat ion 
Oncc a proposed Dialogue-game has successfully survived the  f i l ter ing proce.Bses 
describe-d above, i t  i s  thcn instantiated by the Dialogue-game Manager. Those 
Parameter Specifications not prcviou:ly known (represented in the WS) are estab l ished 
as new ly  in fc r red  knowledge about the Parameters. A large par t  of t he  imp l ic i t  
communication between dialogue participants i s  modeled through instantiation. 
To i l lustrate this, suppose that the fol lowing come to be represented in  WS (i.e., 
known) in the  course of assimilating an utterance: 
SPEAKER does not know how to do a TASK. 
S P E A ~ E R  wants to  know how to  do that TASK. 
SPEAKER wants t-o do the TASK* 
Thcso a re  adequate to nominate the Helping-game. I n  the process of instantiating th i s  
Dialogue-game, the fol lowing predicates are added to WS: 
SPEAKER bel ieves HEARER knows h o w  to do TASK, 
SPEAKER bel ieves HEARER i s  able to  tel l  him h o w  to d o  TASK. 
SPEAKER believes HEARER i s  wi l l ing to tell him how to do TASK.. 
SPEAKER wants HEARER to  tell hirn.how t o  do TASK. 
SPEAKER expects HEARER to  t'cll'him how to do TASK. 
Thc model predicts that jhcsc predicates w i l l  bo impl ici t ly communicated by an 
ut terance which r;uccecds in instantiating thc Helping-game. This corresponds to  a 
dialogue in which "&I can't gct this thing to work" i o  taken to  eommuhicate thot ' thc speaker 
wnnts to "get this thing to work" (even,though, on the surface, i t  i s  only a simple 
declarative of the speaker9$ abi'lity). 
Conduct 
Oncc a Dialogue-game i s  instantiated, tho Dialogue-game Managcr i c  guided by thc 
Corhponcnts in cornprohcnding tho rect of the dialogue. Thars Component$ ore g o o k  for 
A Model  of Dialogue 
the dialogue participants. For the speaker, thesegoals guide what he i s  next to say: for 
thc hcarcr, these provide expectations for the functions to be served by the speaker s 
subscqucnt utterances. 
Thcse "tactical" goals are central to our theory of language: an utterance i s  not 
dccmcd ta be comprehended until some direct consequence of i t  i s  seen as serving a goal 
imputed to the spcakcr Furtherfiore, although the goals of the ~ o m p o n c n i s  arc active 
only w i t h i n  the conduct ef a particular game, their pursuit leads to the satisfaction of t he  
goals described in the Parameter ?pccifications, which were held by the participants 
p r i o r  to  the evocation cf ihe Dialogue-game. 
I n  the case of the Helping-game, t he  goals i n  tho "diagnostic" phase arc that thc 
tIELPEE dcscr ibc a scquoncc of related, uncxceptional cvcnte leading up to a failure of h i s  
cxpectotions. Thcse goals model the  state cyf th6  HELPER as he assimilates this initial 
part of thc  dialogue, both in that he  knows how tho HE~PEE i s  attempting l o  dcscribc h is  
problcrn, and also that thc HELPER knows whcn this phase i s  past, and thc time has  come 
(Ihc "trcatrncnt" phase) for h im to provide the help which has been implici t ly rcquesteel. 
The processes described above perform thc  identification and pursui t  of 
Dia lo~ue-games.  How, then, arc DGs terminated? Thc Parameter Specifications 
rcp rescn t  thosc a:pects of dialogues that arc constant over that particular t ype  of 
dialogue. The Oinloguc-Game Modcl pushas this a step further in specifying that the 
Dislo~uc-,game continues only sr long  a r  the Parameter Specifications continuc to  hold. 
Whcnevcr any predicate i n  the Speci f icel ion ceases to hold, then tho model prcdicls tho

A Model of Dialogue 
The Dialogue - ,name Processes 
In this section we describe the major process elements of the Dialogue-Game 
Model. All the major parts and their connectivity are shown in Fieure 1. Thcse parts 
( two rncmorics and six Proccsscs) wi l l  each be described separately. Thc appendix 
contains an extensive, detailed trace of the model as i t  analyzes (via hand simulation) a 
naturally occurring dialogue fragment. Finally, we wi l l  summarize our experience with 
the model to date. 
Long-term Mcrnory (LTM) 
The Long-Term Memory i s  the rnodcl's representation of a participant's knowledge 
of the external world. I t  contains the initial knowledge states of the participants: the 
grammatical case frames, the semantic structures for  word-senses, tho knowledge of the  
s~b jcc t ,mat te r  of the dia lopu~,  the various ways in which dialoeues are structured, ctc. 
LTMis a semantic network, containing a set of nodes (also called concepts) and the  
relations that hold between them at the Iowost ievel. This information i s  stored i n  the  
form of triples: 
<node- 1 relation node-2> 
Wc have this machinery encoded and working--a 611 complement of read and write 
primitives for th is representation. However, i t  has proven awkward for us to specify 
knowlcdge at this level, so we have implemented further machinery (named SIM) to  
tran.olatc n-ary predicates into these triples. Thuq far a predicate, P, having arguments 
A 1, A2, and A3, SIM can be given the input: 
PI: (Alpha P Beta Gamma) 
[ m c a ~ i n g  that P1 i s  defined to be an instance of P (the predicate always goes iR s w d  
position) w i t h  arguments Alpha for A l ,  Beta for A2 and Gamma-?or A3.1 The result ing 
t r ip les w e  created: 
<P1 PRED P> 
<P1 A 1  ALPHA, 
<Pl A 2  BETA> 
<PI A 3  GAMMA> 
Let's examine a more concrete example; suppose we want to include in the LTM 
that:

Workspace (WS) 
The Workspace is the model's representation for that information which the 
participant i s  activcly using, This memory corresponds roughly ta a model of the 
participant's focus of attention. 
Whi le  the L'TM i s  static during the operation of the model (we are not attempting to  
simulate learning), the WS i s  extremely volatile, with elements (activations) coming into 
and out of focus c ~ t i n u o u s l y .  A l l  incoming sensations (i.e., utterances) appear in the WS, 
as do all augmentations of the participant's knowledge and goal statc. The 
representational format of the WS i s  the same a s  in LTM. Each node in the WS isa token 
(copy) of some node in  LTM. Whenever some process determines that the model's 
attention (WS) should include a token of a specific node (C) from LTM, a new node (A) i s  
created by copying C and this new node i s  added to the WS. A i s  referred to as an 
a r t l r , n t l n n n ( r a n r l i h r , a i w -  
<A I A Q  C> 
This rcprescntatim providcs the associative links between an object i n  attention, and the 
body of knowledge assbciated wi th  it, but not yet broucH into attention. 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
This module produces activations representing each successive utterance to be 
processed. These rcprcscntations are generated from the surface string using a 
standard ATN Grammar similar to those developed by Woods (19701 and Norman, 
Rumelhart, fir the LNR Research Group (1975). We use a case grammar represeniation, 
w i t h  each utterance spccificd as a main predicate with a set of parameters. Bccausc th is  
module i s  a conventional parser whose implementation i s  well understood, we hove so far- 
produced hand parses of the input utterances, following an ATN grammar. 
Protcus 
This i s  a sprcodine activation mechanism, which modifies thc activation of conccpts 
spccificd as rclatcd in  LTM whenever a givcn c o n c ~ p t  bccomcs active. This mcchanism 
provides a way to intcgratc top-down and bottom-up processing with in a uniform 
framework (Lcvin, 1976). The Dial ogue-Game iilodel uses Protcus to activate a 
conccpt, given tha a number of closcly relatcd conccpts (Componcnts, fcaturcs, 
instances, etc.) arc active. 
I 9  Protcus opcratcs on all cu r rw t  activations to modify their salience", a numbcr 
associated with each activation that generally represents the importance or rclcvancc of 
t h e  conccpt. Two kinds of influence relations can exist bctwccn conccpts: cxc i t c  or 
inhibit. I f  an excite r e l a t i ~ n  exists, then Protcus increases the salience af the 
activation of that concept in  proportion to the saliencc of the influencing conccpt. The 
higher the salience of an activation, the larger i t s  influence on directly re la ted  conccpts. 
I f  an inhibit relation i s  spccificd. then Process decreases the salience of the activation 
of the neighboring conccpt. 
Match 
TI- is Proccx i  idkntifics conccpts in LTM that  arc congruent to cxistinc activationr. 
The Diologuc-Game Modcl conthins a numbcr of cquivalencc-like relations, which Mal'ch 
uses to idcntify a conccpt in LTM as rcprcscn t in~  thc same thing as an activation of somo 
~ccrningly different concept. Once this equivalent conccpt is found, i t  i s  activated. 
Dcpcnding on how this conccpt i o  dcfincd in LTM, i t s  activation may havo cffects. on othcr 
processes (for cxamplo, i f  thc canccpt i s  part of a rulc, Dcducc may bo invoked). 
Match can be vicwcd as an attcrnpt to find an activation (A )  in  WS and a Concc!pt (C)

thcsc subordinate matches succeed i s  the  top-level Match said to  succccd. 
Clearly, for  structures of significant complexity, Match may eventually call itc,clf 
rccursivcly, t o  an arbitrory depth. However, since each subordinate call i s  on a strictly 
smaller unit, th is  process must coitvcrge. 
A Madcl of Dialogue 
Our experience has shown us that this type of mechanism plus a collection of 
rewrite rules enable us to eventually map a wide variety of input parsing structirrcs to 
pre-stored, abstract knowledge structures, in a way that a significant aspect o f  thei r  
intended meaning has been ass imi la ted in the process. 
Dcducc 
This opcratcs to carry out a rule when that rule has become active. Rules are of 
the form (Condition)->(Action), and Dcduce scnscs thc activity of a rule and applies the 
ru le by activating the concept for the action. Whatcver corresponocnces were evolved 
in the coursc.of cccating the activation of the condition ( lef t )  half of i h e  rule are carr ied 
over into thc activation of the action (right) half. The combination of Match and Dcduce 
a em. gives us the capability o f  a production syct 
Thc operation of Dcducc i s  relatively simple. I t  i s  called oniy when d rule  i s  a c t i v e  
in the  WS. Dcducc attempts to match the left half of this rule with some other activation 
i n  the WS. (This has ty-pically already been done by match.) Assuming this i s  
accomplished, Dcduce creste t  an ac,tivalion of the right half of the rule, substi luting in the 
activation f o r  all subparts for which thcke are correspondences with the i c f t  half. 
Once a Dialogue-game has been activated (by Protcu.,) as possibly the 
comrnunrcation f o r m  being bid for a dialogue, the Dialogue-game Manager uses i t  to  guide 
thc  assimilation of successive utterances of the  dialogue, through four stages: 
1. establ ish the Parameter values and verify that no Specification i s  
contradictcd, 
2. cstabli ;h olhcrwi sc unsupported Specifications as assumptions, 
3. cstrrblish the Components as  goal$ of thc participanfs, 
4. dctcct the c i rcumstancc~ which indicate that the Dialogue-game is.

periodically chcckcd i n  the hope that later activity by the Manager will lead t o  the 
creation of appropriate activations. 
Fo r  each of the Specifitations, a check i s  made to determine i f  i t  already has an 
activat ion in WS. ( In most cases, the activation of some of these Specifications will have 
led t o  the activi ty of the Dialogue-game itself.) The Specifications having activations need  
no further attention. 
For all remaining Spcc,ifications, activations are created substituting for t h e  
Parametcrs as determined above. At this stage, the Dialogue-game Manager cal ls 
Protcus to determine the stability of thcso new activations. Any new activation w h i c h  
contradicts exist ing activations will have i ts level of activity sharply reduced by Proteus. 
I f  th is  happens, the Dialogue-game Manager concludes that some of the necessary 
precondit ions for  the game db not hold (are i n  conflict with current understanding) and 
that th is  particular game should be abandoned. Otherwise, the new activaticns stand as 
new knowledge, following from the hypothesis that the chosen game i s  appropriate, 
The Dialogue-game has now been successfully entered: the Manager sets up the  
t h i r d  phase, creating activations of the Dialogue-game's Components, w i t h  appropr ia te 
substitutions. (By this time, any unresolved Parameters may well have -activations, 
permit t ing thei r  resolution.) This sets up all of the game-specific knowledge and goals f o r  
both participants. 
Finally, the Manager detects that one of the Specifications no longer appears to 
hold. This signals the impending termination of the Dialogue-game. I n  fact, t he  
utterance whikh contai'ns this information i s  a bid to terminate. At th is  point, i f  t he  
par t ic i  pants7 init ial  goals are satisfied (thus contradicting the Specification which cal ls  f o r  
t he  prcsence of those goals) the interaction ends "successfully". Otherwise, t he  
Dialogue-game i s  terminated for some other reason (e.g., one participant's unwil l ingness 
o r  inabi l i ty to  continue) and would generally be regarded as a "failure". These 
consequences are infcrred by the Manager and added to the WS. When a Dialogue-game 
has terminated, i t s  salience goes to zero and i t  i s  removed from the WS. 
Pronoun Proccsscs 
The Dialogue-Gamo Model contains a set of Pronoun Processes, including an 
I-Process, a You-Process, and an It-Process. Each of those i s  invoked whenever  the /' 
associated surface word  appears in an input utterance,, and operates to identify some 
preexis t ing activationthat can be seen as a view of  the same object.

Each of these Processes search t h e  curreot context, as represented by the current 
sct of act i ra t ions in the WS, using tho katures specified there ro identify a set of possible 
co-rcfctcntial expressions. When there is more than one possibility, the one with a

DEFICIENCIES IN CURRENT MAN-MACHINE COMMUNICATION 
With the understanding we new have of the multi-sentential aspects of human 
communication, i t  i s  easy to  see why man-machine cornrnun'ietion appears so alien, highly 
restrictive, uncomprehending and awkward. This i s  because major regulation and 
interpret4 f ion structures are missing. 
In  Table 1, we compare human dialogue and typical man-machine com.munication 
with respect to some of these features, The table designates a "sender" ancfa "receiver" 
which should be identified with the person and the computer, respeclively, in the 
man-machine communication case.

The ideal interface, arid the sort toward which this research is  direded, would be 
continuously askihg itself: "Why did he say that?". From answers to this, the interface 
would infcr just what the human was expecting as a response. This would con~titute a 
major s lcp  toward the enabling t h o  intcrface to servo the actual (rather than the poorly 
cxprcsscd) needs of the user. Finally, such an intorface would require much l c o ~  
adaptation on thc parf of the user, and so, by our original hypotheois, would significantly 
enhance the cffcctivencss of the man-machine partnership. 
A Model of Dialogue 
This paper has described a research effort into the modeling of human dialogue. 
The purpose of this research has been to  uncover and describe i n  process models, 
reculari t ics that occur in dialogue. I t  i s  hopcd that the enhqnced understanding of human 
communication which rcsul ts, will facilitate the development of more natural (and thus 
more effective) man-machine interfatcs. 
Thc principal regularity w'e have discovered i s  a collection of knowledge and goal 
structures, called Dialoeue-games, which seem to be crucial in understanding the 
structure of naturally-occurring dialogues. According to the theory we have proposed, 
one or more of these Dialogue-games serve as the major organizing influence on every  
human didlogue. 
Each Dialogue-game specifies what knowledge each person must have to ehgage in 
such a dialogue, and what goals of the participants might be served by that interchange. 
A Dialogue-game also spccifies, as a sequence of "tactical" goals, the manner in which the 
dialogue i s  conducted. 
The Diatogua-game Model i s  a collection of cooperative processes which 
continuausly updated a representation of each participant's attention state in a 
Workspaco. The model recognizes when a particular Dialogue-game i s  being bid, 
accepted, pursued and terminated, and represents these states appropriately in the 
Workspace. A particular Dialogue-game, the Helping-game, was described in some 
dctajl. A simulation of the evocation and use of the Helping-game on a segment of natural 
dialogue i s  contained in the Appendix. 
Our experience so far wi th the Dialogue-game Model has reinforced our 
hypothcses that an understanding of the goal-serving aspects of dialogue i s  a powerfd l  . 
tool in understanding the individual di~alogues.

APPENDIX -- SIMULATION OF THE DIALOGUE-GAMES MODEL 
Example of the.Oia[ogue Modcl in Action 
In this appendix we describe an extensive simulation of the ar rent  state of the 
Dialogue-game Model. We make use of a particular version of the Helping-game and alsc 
explore another structure, an Execution Scene, which describes the customary events 
surrounding the successful execution of a particular program (Runoff). 
We start by describing this more detailed version of the Helping-game, introducing 
names fo r  the various aspects, to be used later. Next we show a short, naturally 
occurring dialogue between a computer operator and a user. 'Then we describe the  
operation of the Dialoeuc-garnc'Model as i f  assimilates this dialogue, up to the point at 
wh ich  i t  concludes that thc Helping-game i s  an appropriate structure t h r o u ~ h  which to 
understand the subr;cqucnt utterances. 
Once this hypothesis for the form of thedialogue has been chosen, we continue the 
simulation to examine how Jhc model dccidcs that a particular Execution Scene i s  
appropriate for assimilating the content of the dialogue. 'Next, we see how this choice of 
occnes cnhances the set of goals imputed to the speaker, thus facil i tating the 
cornprehcnsion of what he i s  saying. Finally, we summarize our experience with the 
Dialogue-game Model so far. 
A Dctai/ed Structure for the help in,^ - game 
What  fol4ows i s  the substance of the communication structure we have namcd the 
Hclping-game. In the interests of clarity af presentation, the formal structureo of the 
definition have been expressed in prose. However, the elements of the fol lowing 
description correspond one-to-one to those in the actual Helping-game used in ?the 
simulation. 
HELPING-GAME 
Paramctcrs: 
Thc parameters are two roles (HELPER and HELPEE) and a topic (TASK/HG). 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
Parameter specifications: 
The HELPER and HELPEE are each a kind of person. 
H1 = A goal of t he  HELPEE i s  that he  perform TASK/HG. 
H2 = I t  i s  not true that HELPEE i s  able to  perform th is  TASKIHG. 
H5 = The HELPEE wants to be ablc to pcrform the TASKIHG. 
(being able to perform ?he task i s  a subgoal of 
performing the task) 
H6 = The  ELP PER i s  able t.o enable the HELPEE to .perform the TASK/HG. 
H8 .I Thc HELPER i s  willing(= i s  ablc to  want to ...) to  enable the 
HELPEE to perform the TASKIHG. 
H10 = The HELPEE i s  permitted to perform the TASK/HG. 
H I  1 = Thc  HELPEE wants the HELPER to  enable him to perform the TASKIHG. 
(bcing enabled to  perform the task.is6a subgoal of 
performing the task) 
Game components:

[note:  a n  execu t ion  scene i s  a flowchart-like description 
of thc use af a particular process; more details below] 
HGX2 = The HELPEEknowe that his perceiving the terminal state of XS/HE 
would satisfy h is  wanting to perform TASKIHG. 
HGXPC= (Thus) The HELPEE wants to perceive XS/HE in th is terminal 
state, 
(this perception i s  a subgoal of performing the TASKIHG) 
ACTION/GUOD = an ACTION of XS/HE which was realized in the past. 
HGX3 = The HELPEE knows he has perceived this ACTION/GOOD. 
HGX4 = T~C"HELPEE knows he had expected to  per te ive it. 
HGX5 = Thc HELPEE knows hc wants t o  perceive this ACTION/GOOD. 
(pcrcciviny: the ACTION/GOOD i s  a sub~oal  of perceiving tho

The subsequent  simulation is  of the model .processing t h e  f i rst five segments, t h e  
ent i re  f i rs t  utterance. Each utterance i s  ingested one at a time, by the Parser, and the 
assimilat ion proceeds until a quiescent state i s  reached (much more detail, below) 
whereupon the next segment is  parsed and input for processing. 
The ident i f icat ion of thc  hclping-gamc 
How docs thc model know to evoke the Helping-game? To exhibi t  answers to t h i ~  
and  subscqucnt questions, we lead tho reader through a simulation of the model as i t  
p roccsscs  the  beginning of dialogue OC117. We indulge in fhe samc use of prorie fo r  
formal ism as aboQe, again w i t h  the same assuranaes of correspondcnccs with tho actual 
sirnulati on. 
Thc simulation proceeds in cycles: i n  each cycle, we exhibit the operat ion of a 
sinzlc processor, performing one i terat ion of i t s  function. We do not address h c r c  the 
is:uc; of h o w  the model would select w.hich processor to cal l  next. In fact, our dcsign 
cal ls  f o r  these processors to be mgxirnally autonomous and parallel i n  their  operation, 
operat ing whcncvc r  circumstances are r ipe for their function and dormant otherwise.

focusing only on thc  unique aspects of thc current opcrstion. In th is  cxmple.  each 
processor  i s  called at lcastonco in thc processing of each scgment: Match, Dcduco and 
Protcu; bear thc  major burden, having scvoral invocations each pa? segment. 
Cycle 1-1 -- Parse. 
The parser reads one utterance/segment of input and translates it into the formalism 
fo r  activations in the workspace. No claim ' is made that this translation retains all the 
content of the original text, only that i t  is adequately faithful to the level of detail we are 
simulating. 
Results: Case/9 (= (0 perceives that L asks (how do I get Runoff working?))) is activated. 
Cycle 1-2 -- I-processor 
Certain words (e,g. pronouns, determiners) are taken to be signals that a reference 
i s  being made t o  conccpts introduced elsewhere. Sne presence of a concept i n  the  
workspoce corresponding to one of these words lcads to the calling of the. 
process-specialist which attempts to  resolve the implied reference. Thus, the presence 
of "I" i n  the text leads to the calling of the I-process, whose sole function is  to determine 
t h e  referent of the .'I" and modify the stored concept to reflect this. This process judges 
that i f  L i s  asking a question which contains "I" as its subject, then this constitutes 
adequate evidence to hypothesize that "I" is being used to refer to L. 
Results: 0 perceives that L asks (how does L get Runoff working?) 
Cycle 1-3 -- Match 
Match i s  always on the lookout for pairs of nodes, one in the WS and the other i n  the 
LTM, such that the activation (node in WS) matches the concept (node i n  LTM). Th is  i s  
taken to be evidence that the activation is also to be t iken as an activation of the matched 
concept. I t  should be understood that we areaexamining only some of the succewful 
matches which occurred, 
Starting in this cycle, we see a pattern which recurs regularly, and which accounts 
fcr  a significant piece of the action, as the model assimilates the dialogue. Match 
dcterrnincs that a particular activation matches the left half (condition side, i f  part, etc.) of 
a production-like rule srorcd in LTM. This successful match leads t o  the identification of 
the  corrcspondcnces between the aspects of the activation and those of the left half of 
the rule, ae well as creating an activation of the rule itself. The activation of a rule leads 
to calling the Deduce processor in thenext cycle, which applies the activated rub to  the 
node i n  the WS responsible for the rule's activation. This application of a rule (which 
also results in thc removal of the rule's activation from the WS) creates a new activation 
structure in the WS. 
A Modcl of Dialogue 
In othcr words, the introduction of a piece of knowledge suggests that a certain 
transformation (e.g.,'"Whcncver you know X, you can conclude Y.") i s  appropriate. This 
transformation i s  applied to the stimurus knowledge to generste a conclusion: a new piece 
of knowledge. 
In this particular case, the above result structure i s  found to match the left half of 
Rule0 = I f  Opcrce ives  a proposition, 
then 0 knows that proposition. 
w i t h  thc correspondenccs 
Case/l (= (L asks(How do I get Runoff working?))) is  activated. 
corresponds to  the proposition. 
(This ru lc  ~cp rcscn ts  the approximation that what i s  perceived i s  accepted at face value.) 
Sincc Casc/g i s  n o w  scon to be an activation of the Left-half of RuleO, an activation 
for the rule itself i s  created in the WS, 
Results: Case19 i s  an activation of Left half of RuJeO. 
Casa/j.corresponds to the proposition in RuleO. 
An activation of Rule0 i s  entered into WS. 
Cycle 1-4 -- Deduce 
Sincc a rule i s  active in WS, Ocduce i s  called in an attempt to apply thc rule. The 
Match has guar'antced that the necessary correspondences exists betwoen t he  left half of 
the rule and the n'odc which is its activation. To apply the rOle, Deduce creates an 
activation of the righthalf, with the corresponding sub-parts substituted. 
Rcsul ts: RO- 1 = 0 knows Casc/l 
Activation of RuleO deleted from WS. 
Cycle 1-5 -- Match 
Match finds that RO-1 matches the left half of: 
Rule1 = If 0 knows (L asks about a proposition), 
then 0 knows (L does not know about that proposition). 
A Madcl of Dialogue 
Rcsults: RO-1 i s  an activation of the loft half of Rulel.  
Case/l corrcsponds to (L asks about a proposition) 
Case12 = (How does L get Runoff working) corresponds to the 
proposition. 
An activation of Rule1 i s  created in the WS. 
Cycle 1-6 -- Deduce 
Dcduce applies Rule 1 to  RO- 1, substituting according to the discovered 
corrcspondcnccs. 
Rcsults: R1-1 (= 0 knows (L does not know Case/2), i s  activated.) 
Activation of Rule 1 deleted from MS. 
Cycle 1-7 -- Match 
Match R l - 1  with left half of 
Rule3 = If 0 knows that a person does not know how to perform a

Rcsults: R1-1 is  an activation of the left half of Rule3, 
L corresponds to the person mentioned. 
Get corccoponds to Perform. 
Tho state of Runoff working corresponds to the task. 
An activation of Rule3 is'created in the WS. 
Cycle 1-8 -- Dcduce 
Deduce applies Rule3 to R1-1. 
Results: R 3 - 1  (= 0 knows that R3-11= (L i s  not able to perform 
(getting Runoff working)) i s  activated).

Cycle 1-21 -- Dialogue-game Manager 
Thc-presence of an activation of a Dialogue-game in the WS leads to the calling of 
thc processor spccializcd in this.catcgory of knowledge. The Dialogue-game Manager 
(OGM) makes use of a set of correspondences that have already been established by the 
matches which led to the activations of HI, H2, and H11: 
A Modol of Dialogue 
Previous Rosults: L corresponds to  Hclpee 
0 corresponds to  Helper 
Case13 (= (Runoff working)) corresponds to the task. 
Once ar) activation of a eamc has led to the calling of the DGM, the Manager accesses 
thc  cntira collection of information about tho game from the LTM representation bf it. 
Tho itcms of knowledge in tho game, with tho particular parameters of this situation 
substituted apprcrpriatcly, fal l  into one of three categories: 
1. Alrcady known to hearor (e.g. HI ,  H2 & H11). Items in this category are 
simply icnorod, since it serves no purpose to re-assert them. 
2. Contradict knowlcdgc already held by the hearer (e.g., i f  0 already k,ncw, 
for sure, that t knew all about Runoff). I f  any item falls into this category, the 
hypothesis that this game is  active i s  simply abandoned as inaccurate. 
3. Mtms ncithcr previously known or contradicted (the major i ty of the 
contcnt of the typical case). I n  this case, tho DGM creates activations of 
thcsc items to  represent the collection of impl i t i t  knowledge that follows from 
a recognition of the proposed game. 
Rcsul ts: Activations are  created for all of the following: 
H5 = L wants to be able t o  get (Runoff workin$) himself. 
(being able to  get (Runoff working) i s  a subgoal 
to  performing (Runoff working).) 
H6 = 0 i s  able to enable L to  gct (Runoff working). 
H8 = O i s  able to want to enablc [i.e. i s  wil l ing to enable] 
L to gct (Runoff working). 
101.C i s  permitted to get (Runoff working). 
Thc game also contains a collection of knowledge having to do with the conduct of 
thc  game, rather than what the parllcipantsneed to  successfully evoke it. These items of 
knowledte and goals are also established as activations by thaDGM at this time: 
Resutts: Activations are created or all of the following: 
HGx1 = L knows of an execution scene (XS/HE). 
HGx2 = L knows that i f  he perceives a particular 
terminal state of this scene, this wi l l

Cycle 1-22 -- Proteus 
As a result of the numerous rcfarcncar to Runoff and XS/HE, tho activationo for 
thcsc two conccpts are "highly active". ~ o n s c ~ u c n t l ~ ,  when Protcus i o  called, tho 
eonccpt XSjRO (the execution sccno of tho Runoff proccos) bocarnoo active and, duo to i ts  
similarity to  XSfHE, i s  taken to be equivalent to it. Sinca XS/RO is  more dctailad (conte in~ 
more information) than XS/HE, XS/RO i s  used in place i f  XS/HE in all of the expressions 
introduced in Cycle 1-21. 
Something wo pnsscd ovcr in  thc earlier examples was tha issuo of vyhcn tho modcl 
i s  willine to stop processing a given piece of tcxl and eo on la the nexf onc. It scorns 
inappropriate l o  demand that tho rncdol wring all possiblo information end deductions out 
of each utterance. Yet there must bo soms demands mada on tho assimilation. A n  
altcrnatc form of tho question is: what ncedr of his own does the hearer see the incoming 
text as potentially satisfyinc? We have taken the position that a hearer (tentatively) 
understands an utterance, when he successfully views i t  as serving some goal imputed to 
the spcskcr. That is,  to a first approximation, the hearer has assimilated an utterance if 
hc fisures out why thc spcakcr said it. 
Thc modcl has already established (HCX9 and HGX10, above) that L wants to 
dcscribc (implicitly, to  0) certain action; in XS/RO b a t  L expected to perceive, and in 
s o n w  csscs, did, Thus, in thc following uttcrsnces, we see the modol matching the 
parsed input structure with one of thcsc two goals, thus it i s  sccn as bcing in service of a 
goal of thc spcakcr, and need bc examined no further (for tho time being). 
In thc subscqucnl example, we use two ncw rules: RS (Satisfaction) and RQ 
(Quicsccncc). RS dctcrrnincs when an uttcranco i s  sccn to satisfy a speaker's goal and 
R Q ,  rcscts to  this dcfectcd satisfaction by marking the utterance quicsccnt. 
(Opcrationolly, this means that in tho next cycle, thc Parser i s  called to input the next 
scgmcnt af text.) 
Wc resume the example at the point where the first segment has been marked 
quicsccnt, and the Parser is called.

then the first person knows that the realization of the 
proposition satisfies the second person's desire for it. 
Results: RO- l a  = (0 knows (L declares...)) corresponds to

0 corresponds to the first pcrson.

The It-processor translates "it" to "Runoff". Rule0 i s  used by Match and Deduce to 
rcplace "pcrccivc" with "know". Match and Deduce then apply RS and RQ, to determine 
that CasefSb i s  compr'ehendcd as constituting another instance of (L describes

Rp = I f  a persondeclares that something didn't happen, 
then he i s  declaring he did-not perceive i t  happen. 
I n  this case, however, we determine that Case/Sd i s  comprehended as constituting 
an instance of (L wants (L describe action/bad)) [XSA-15 = Runoff produces output on
