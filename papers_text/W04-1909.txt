Abstract 
This paper proposes and evaluates the use of 
linguistic information in the pre-processing 
phase of text mining tasks. We present several 
experiments comparing our proposal for 
selection of terms based on linguistic 
knowledge with usual techniques applied in 
the field. The results show that part of speech 
information is useful for the pre-processing 
phase of text categorization and clustering, as 
an alternative for stop words and stemming.  
1 Introduction 
Natural language texts can be viewed as 
resources containing uniform data in such a way 
that methods similar to those used in Data Base 
Knowledge Extraction can be applied to them. The 
adaptation of these methods to texts is known as 
Text Mining (Tan, 1999). Machine learning 
techniques are applied to document collections 
aiming at extracting patterns that may be useful to 
organize or recover information from the 
collections. Tasks related to this area are text 
categorization, clustering, summarization, and 
information extraction.  One of the first steps in 
text mining tasks is the pre-processing of the 
documents, as they need to be represented in a 
more structured way.  
Our work proposes a new technique to the pre-
processing phase of documents and we compare it 
with usual pre-processing methods. We focus on 
two text mining tasks, namely text categorization 
and clustering. In the categorization task we 
associate each document to a class from a pre-
defined set, in the clustering task the challenge is 
to identify groups of similar documents without 
being aware of pre-defined classes. Usually, the 
pre-processing phase in these tasks are based on 
the approach called bag-of-words, in which just 
simple techniques are used to eliminate 
uninteresting words and to reduce various 
semantically related terms to the same root (stop-
words and stemming, respectively). As an 
alternative, we propose the use of linguistic 
information in the pre-processing phase, by 
selecting words according to their category (nouns, 
adjectives, proper names, verbs) and using its 
canonical form. We ran a series of experiments to 
evaluate this proposal over Brazilian Portuguese 
texts.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents an overview of text mining. Section 3 
presents the methods used for collecting the 
linguistic knowledge used in the experiments. The 
experiments themselves are described in Section 4. 
Section 5 presents an analysis of the results and the 
paper is concluded in Section 6. 
 
2 Text Mining 
Text mining processes are usually divided in five 
major phases: A) Document collection: consists of 
the definition of the set of the documents from 
which knowledge must be extracted. B) Pre-
processing: consists of a set of actions that 
transform the set of documents in natural language 
into a list of useful terms. C) Preparation and 
selection of the data: consists in the identification 
and selection of relevant terms form the pre-
processed ones. D) Knowledge Extraction: consists 
of the application of machine learning techniques 
to identify patterns that can classify or cluster the 
documents in the collection. E) Evaluation and 
interpretation of the results: consists of the 
analysis of the results.  
The pre-processing phase in text mining is 
essential and usually very expensive and time 
consuming. As texts are originally non-structured a 
series of steps are required to represent them in a 
format compatible with knowledge extraction 
methods and tools. The usual techniques employed 
in phase B are the use of a list of stop-words, 
which are discarded from the original documents 
and the use of stemming which reduces the words 
to their root.  
Having the proper tools to process Portuguese 
texts, we investigate whether linguistic information 
can have an impact on the results of the whole 
process. In the next section we describe the tools 
we used for acquiring the linguistic knowledge in 
which we base our experiments. 
3 Tools for acquiring linguistic knowledge 
The linguistic knowledge we use in the 
experiments is based on the syntactic analysis 
performed by the PALAVRAS parser (Bick, 
2000). This Portuguese parser is robust enough to 
always give an output even for incomplete or 
incorrect sentences (which might be the case for 
the type of documents used in text mining tasks). It 
has a comparatively low percentage of errors (less 
than 1% for word class and 3-4% for surface 
syntax) (Bick, 2003). We also used another tool 
that makes easier the extraction of features from 
the analyzed texts: the Palavras Xtractor (Gasperin 
et. al. 2003).  This tool converts the parser output 
into three XML files, containing: a) the list of all 
words from the text and their identifier; b) morpho-
syntactic information for each word; c) the 
sentence?s syntactic structures. Using XSL 
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language)1 we can extract 
specified terms from the texts, according to their 
linguistic value. The resulting lists of terms 
according to each combination are then passed to 
phases C, D and E. The experiments are described 
in detail in the next section. 
4 Experiments 
4.1 Corpus 
The corpus used in the experiments is composed 
by a subset of the NILC corpus (N?cleo 
Interdisciplinar de Ling??stica Computacional2) 
containing 855 documents corresponding to 
newspaper articles of Folha de S?o Paulo from 
1994. These documents are related to five 
newspaper sections: informatics, property, sports, 
politics and tourism.  
4.2 Pre-processing techniques 
We prepared three different versions of the 
corpus (V1, V2 and V3) for 3-fold cross validation. 
Each version is partitioned in different training and 
testing parts, containing 2/3 and 1/3 of the 
documents respectively. 
For the experiments with the usual methods, 
irrelevant terms (stop-words) were eliminated from 
the documents, on the basis of a list of stop-words, 
containing 476 terms (mainly articles, prepositions, 
auxiliary verbs, pronouns, etc). The remaining 
terms were stemmed according to Martin Porter?s 
algorithm (Porter, 1980). Based on these

techniques we generated a collection of pre-
processed documents called PD1. 
To test our proposal we then pre-processed the 
855 documents in a different way: we parsed all 
texts of our corpus, generating the corresponding 
XML files and extracted terms according to their 
grammatical categories, using XSL. Based on these 
techniques we generated a collection of pre-
processed documents called PD2. 
4.2.1 Other mining phases 
All other text mining phases were equally 
applied to both PD1 and PD2. We used relative 
frequency for the selection of relevant terms. The 
representation of the documents was according to 
the vector space model. For the categorization task, 
vectors corresponding to each class were built, 
where the more frequent terms were selected. After 
that, a global vector was composed. We also tested 
with different numbers of terms in the global 
vector (30, 60, 90, 120, 150). For the clustering 
task we measured the similarity of the documents 
using cosine. After calculating similarity of the 
documents, the data was codified according to 
format required by the machine learning tool Weka 
(Witten, 2000). Weka is a collection of machine 
learning algorithms for data mining tasks that 
contains tools for data pre-processing, 
classification, regression, clustering, association 
rules, and visualization.  
In this work the adopted machine learning 
techniques are Decision Tree for the categorization 
process and K-means for text clustering.  
Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm 
based on the recursive division of the training 
examples in representative subsets, using the 
metric of information gain. After the induction of a 
classifying tree, it can be applied to new examples, 
described with the same attributes of the training 
examples. 
K-means divides a group of objects in k groups 
in a way that the resulting intracluster similarity is 
high, but the intercluster similarity is low. The 
similarity of groups is measured in respect to the 
medium value of the objects in a group, which can 
be seen as the center of gravity (centroid) of the 
group. The parameters used to run k-means are the 
default ones as suggested by the tool, seed 10 and 
5 groups.  
The evaluation of the results for the 
categorization task is based on the classification 
error, which was used to compare the results for 
PD1 and PD2. For the clustering task the 
evaluation of the results is given by recall and 
precision, based on the generated confusion 
matrices. 
5 Results 
5.1 Text Categorization 
Table 1 shows the results for text categorization 
of PD1, given by the average error rates 
considering the three versions the corpus (V1, V2 
and V3). We had around 20% of error for the 
categorization task. We can see minor variations in 
the results according to the size of the vectors. Best 
results were obtained for 150 terms.  
 
Terms 30 60 90 120 150 
Errors 21,64 21,99 20,47 20,35 19,77 
Table 1: Average Classification Error for PD1% 
Table 2 shows the results for different 
grammatical combinations in PD2, while Figure 1 
summarizes the lowest error rates found for PD1 
and all groups of PD2. The group nouns and 
adjectives presents the lower error rates of all 
experiments (18,01). However, due to the small 
size of the corpus, the improvement reported 
between usual methods (18,01) and nouns-
adjectives (20,47), when considering the same 
number of terms (90), are at 75-80% confidence 
level only (t-test). 
In general, the results show that the presence of 
nouns is crucial, the worst classification errors are 
based on groups that do not contain the category 
nouns, and here the confidence level for the 
differences reported reaches 95%. The groups 
containing nouns present results comparable to 
those found in the experiments based on usual 
methods of pre-processing. The use of verbs, either 
alone or with other grammatical groups is not an 
interesting option.

Nouns-verbs-
adjectives 35,09 27,02 27,72 24,21 23,51 
Table 2: Average Classification Error for PD2  
It can be observed that usually the best results 
are obtained when the documents are represented 
by a larger number of terms (90, 120 and 150), for 
the group nouns, however, the best results were 
obtained for vectors containing just 60 terms.  
Figure 1: Lower error rates for PD1 and PD2 
We looked at the terms resulting from different 
selection methods and categories to check the 
overlap among the groups. From PD1 to PD2 
based on nouns and adjectives (the one with the 
best results) we could see that we had around 50% 
of different terms. That means that 50% of terms in 
PD1 are terms included in the categories nouns and 
adjectives and 50% of the terms selected on the 
basis of stop-words and stemming are from other 
grammatical categories. As adjectives added to 
nouns improved the results, we checked adjectives 
to figure out their significance. We found terms 
such as Brazilian, electoral, multimedia, political. 
Intuitively, these terms seem to be relevant for the 
classes we had. Analysing the groups containing 
verbs, we observed that the verbs are usually very 
common or auxiliary verbs (such as to be, to have, 
to say), therefore not relevant for classification. 
5.2 Text Clustering 
We tested our hypothesis through clustering 
experiments for PD1 and variations of PD2. For 
the experiments on clustering we used vectors 
containing 150 features from V2 and we set k to 5 
groups. The resulting confusion matrix for PD1 is 
presented in Table 3.

Table 3: Confusion Matrix PD1 (150 terms) 
Considering the larger group in each row and 
column (highlighted in the table) as the intended 
cluster for each class, the   corresponding precision 
is of 50,52%. 
We repeated the same set of experiments for 
PD2. We tested several grammatical groups, the 
best result was related to nouns and proper names. 
The results are shown in Tables 4. The 
corresponding precision is 63,15%.

6 Conclusions 
This paper presented a series of experiments 
aiming at comparing our proposal of pre-
processing techniques based on linguistic 
information with usual methods adopted for pre-
processing in text mining.  
We find in the literature other alternative 
proposals for the pre-processing phase of text 
mining. (Gon?alves and Quaresma, 2003) use the 
canonical form of the word instead stemming, for 
European Portuguese. (Feldman et al 1998) 
proposes the use of compound terms as opposed to 
single terms for text mining. Similarly, (Aizawa, 
2001) uses morphological analysis to aid the 
extraction of compound terms. Our approach 
differs from those since we propose single terms 
selection based on different part of speech 
information. 
The results show that a selection made solely on 
the basis of category information produces results 
at least as good as those produced by usual 
methods (when the selection considers nouns and 
adjectives or nouns and proper nouns) both in 
categorization and clustering tasks. In the 
categorization experiments we obtained the lowest 
error rate for PD2 when the pre-processing phase 
was based on the selection of nouns and adjectives, 
18,01%. However, the second best score in the 
case of categorization was achieved by the 
traditional methods, 19,77%. Due to the small 
corpus, further experiments are needed to verify 
the statistical significance of  the reported gains. 
The results of the clustering experiments show a 
difference in precision from  50,52% to 63,15%. 
As we are planning to test our techniques with a 
larger number of documents and consequently a 
larger number of terms, we are considering 
applying other machine-learning techniques such 
as Support Vector Machines that are robust enough 
to deal with a large number of terms. We are also 
planning to apply more sophisticated linguistic 
knowledge than just grammatical categories, as, for 
instance, the use of noun phrases for terms 
selection, since this information is provided by the 
parser PALAVRAS. Other front for future work is 
further tests for other languages.
